HARRIMAN MAY REQUEST
RESIGNATION OF STUBBS
DENVER, Jan. 26.â1t was freely asserted in both
Santa Fe and Union Pacific circles here to-day that Presi
dent Harriman would ask for the resignation of J. C.
Stubbs, traffic manager of the Southern Pacific and Union
Pacific systems, in a few days, following closely a similar
request of Paul Morton, Secretary of the Navy, by Presi
dent Roosevelt. It is said that both resignations will be the
result of revelations concerning the traffic agreement be
tween the Southern Pacific and the Southern Railway, as
the California lines of the Santa Fe were known in 1898,
when the compact was made. Then, too, it is alleged that
Harriman is anxious to win the good will of the Califor
nians, and to do so must let Stubbs go.
CALL. BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 26â While the
members of the House Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce were
trying to agree on.a railroad rate bill
to-day, John Sharpe Williams, the
minority leader, scored a point against
the Republicans of the Senate who are
not disposed to do anything this win
ter. The question came up before the
House during the discussion of an ao
propriatton bill which permitted wide
latitude of debate. Williams declared
that the Democrats were solidly be
hind President Roosevelt in his recom
mendations for better Government su
pervision of railroad rates.
"We are committed to this proposi
tion because it is Democratic in prin
ciple," said Williams, "and I do not
hesitate to say that we are glad to find
that the President of the United States,
on this question, is more of an Amer
ican citizen, interested in the welfare
of all of the people, than any particular
Republican or Democrat. The Demo
cratic party will take step with the
President in this matter and we hone
that the Republican members of this
House will help the good work along."
THUNDERS OF APPLAUSE.
This last remark from the' minority
leader brought forth thunders of ap
plause from the Democratic side of the
House, which was afterward joined in
by the Republicans.
To-day's meeting of the House com
mittee was an exclusive session. There
Were wide difference of opinions on the
Hepburn bill, which was used as the
basis of discussion. The Democrats of
the committee expressed dissatisfaction
with the Hepburn, Esch and Town l -
B tnd measures for not going far
enough, but it will be the policy of the
minority, after trying to amend, to
finally support the majority on the floor
of the House.
Meetings will be held daily until the
bill is agreed to. It was said to-night
by on<' of the majority members of the
committee that the Republicans un
doubtedly would be able to report a
bill next Tuesday or Wednesday.
BELL FAVORS REVISION.
In the House to-day Bell of Califor
nia made a vigorous speech in favor of
railroad rate revision. He directed at
tention to the alleged condition of the
incorporation laws of New Jersey,
which, he said, had brought to that
State the fame of being the breeding
place of mosquitoes, corporations and
trusts, and were so framed as to pro
tect New Jersey only, leaving them
free to prey upon the rest of the coun
try. He charged that the impression
had gone abroad that Congress had be
come subject to corporate influence, and
said that if there were such influence
in the halls of Congress it should be
promptly expelled.
Bell ascribed similar motives to the
use of certain language in the prepa
ration of the law creating the Inter
state Commerce Commission, which
provoked a spirited discussion between
himself. Mann of Illinois and Williams
of Mississippi, the last named asserting
it as his belief that railroad influence
was felt In the Senate at the time the
so-called Cullom bill the
Interstate Commerce Commission was
substituted by the Senate conferees for
the so-called Reagan bill.
BILL NEEDS EXPLANATION.
Bell expressed the hope that Hepburn,
v hen he came to explain the bill, would
prove that there was nothing sinister
in its language. At present, however,
he asserted, the bill was so worded as
to what should constitute a reasonable
rate' that it was susceptible of a double
meaning. Every hint of vagueness "and
indefiniteness, he contended, ought to
be removed.
He defended the Interstate Commerce
Commission, which, he said, had been
held up to public scorn and ridicule.
For the past eight years, since the de
cision of the Supreme Court that the
commission had not the right to fix
rales, the commission had been the
special object of attack of certain men
representing railroad interests in order
to belittle the commission in the eyes
of the people and in order to break
down the confidence of the people in
anybody appointed by the executive.
"If." said Bell In closing, "an oppor
tunity should be afforded to amend the
Hepburn bill In some particulars it
would receive the support of the House
without regard to political division, and

ODD MESSAGE
TELLS OF DEATH
Telephone Announces to the
Father That Son Has
Ended His Own Life
OAKLAND, Jan. 26.âA mysterious
telephonic message received to-night
by M. A. Oleary of 559 Twenty-eighth
street that his son, Paul Oleary, had
committed suicide, was strangely veri
fied by the accidental finding of the
young man's senseless form a short
while afterward almost in front of his
residence.
The unconscious man was taken in
hand at his home by physicians, who
pronounced him in a critical condition,
supposedly .from poisoning. At 10:30
o'clock to-night the father sent word
to the police headquarters that his son
had gone downtown to pay some dues
at a Woodmen's lodge. He had not re
turned home at that hour, and the folks
were worried, because the young man
had not been in good health.
Very soon after that report reached
the police a second message came an
nouncing that the father had been tele
phoned to by some person who had said:
"Paul will be home soon; suicide." This
caused o*leary much anxiety.
It was not long before a third mes
sage reached the police, this time from
Patrolman Ely, who had found what he
reported to be the body of a man lying
on the grass a few feet east of the
Oleary house. Ely said the form was
lifeless, and the Coroner was notified,
but before that official arrived at the
scene Detective Kyte, who was dis
patched to investigate, discovered signs
of life. He aroused -tne Olearys, who
at once recognized the young man who
was the subject of the message. As
soon as young Oleary had been given
over to his people's care the police be
gan an investigation, which at a late
hour had not developed enough to clear
the mystery. They believe the young
man himself sent the warding of death.
Several months ago his mother died.
He became melancholy. â¢
The family wag compelled to send him
to the Receiving Hospital for examin
ation as to his sanity, his mind having
been temporarily unbalanced. But
after a few days' rest he seemed to
improve so much that he was dis
charged. His condition of late had not
given the family cause for serious
alarm.
At I o'clock this morning the father
of Oleary notified the police that his
son's condition was due to an attack
by footpads, who used a blunt instru
ment in severely battering him on the
head. The detectives say this only
complicates the case and falls to ex
plain the suicide message. No marks
of violence were found.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
COLON. Jan. 26.âThe United States
cruiser Dixie has received hurry orders
to proceed to Santo Domingo, and is
now coaling. Two thousand marines
were brought to Colon to-day from
Empire Capes and embarked on the
Dixie.
NEW ORLEANS. La.. Jan. 26.âA ca
blegram received to-night by the Pica
yune from Panama says rush orders
have been received from Washington
to 'send all marines possible from the
isthmus to Santo Domingo, where fight
ing has broken out in the streets of
towns in opposition to the American
protectorate now being arranged by
the United States Government.
The cruiser Dixie, lying in the harbor
of Colon, will leave for the scene of
the insurrection on Friday morning
with 500 marines, under the command
of Colonel Wood. The marines were en
camped at Empire, between Panama
and Colon. Five companies of marines
broke camp there and left for Colon to
day on a special train, equipped with
ammunition and rations. They are due
to reach San Domingo City early Sun
day morning.
At is understood here that these ma
rines will not be sufficient-to success
fully resist the San Domingans, and re.
inf<*reeÂ«?eats will have to be sent from
the United-^States.
The battalion of marines at Empire
had been in camp only a few weeks,
having been brought down to relieve
the 600 men who had for fifteen .months
looked l after American interests during
the exciting times when the republic
of Panama was being created. About
four weeks'"ago the Prairie carried batk
to America this force of men and
brought the battalion now in control
of the zone under command of Colonel
Wood.
This command numbers a few more
than 500 officers and men. The officers,
nearly all of whom have families, had
sent for their wives and in a number
of instances the latter had already ar
rived. The hurry orders which came
so unexpectedly have created a
decided stir in camp and no end of ex
citement on the isthmus itself.

WEIDMANN.
WEIMUTH.
The Empress spent the forenoon with
her son. His condition gives the fami
ly much concern, but there is nothing
to indicate that the attack of pneu
monia is not taking the normal course.
The Emperor, revising the order of
last night abandoning all his birthday
observances, decided to-day to have a
service in the chapel to-morrow and to
receive the court's congratulations, but
the dinner which was to have been giv
en at the palace and other celebrations
have been abandoned.
Crown Prince Frederick William is
confined to his room with what prob
ably is an attack of influenza. It is
denied that he has contracted pneu
monia from his brother, Prince Eitel
Friedrich.
The Cabinet House, where Prince
Eitel Frederick lies, is near the garri
son barracks and drill grounds. All
firing of salutes has been stopped, and
the streets in the vicinity are closed to
vehicles. The Prince of the Asturias,
who was coming here as the guest of
Emperor William, was stopped by a
telegram at Parts.
Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria was at
Ruttek, near the German frontier,
traveling to Berlin, when a telegram
reached him from the German Em
peror suggesting that he do not come

failure of the strike here will have a discouraging effect upon the workmen of other cities.

STATEMENT THAT RUSSIAN STRIKERS WERE RECEIVING AID FROM GREAT BRITAIN.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 26. â Al
though the strikes In Reval, Libau,
Kieff, Odessa and a few smaller places
ate extending, the situation is no
where acute. An increasing number
of Workmen are out in Moscow, but
there is no general tie-up or disorder
there. The whereabouts of Father
Copon still remains a mystery, but it
is believed he is in Moscow.
Minister of the Interior Sviatopolk-
Mirsky has promised a delegation of
editors who called upon him that he
will Investigate the arrest of a number
of prominent writers, who are now con
fined in the St. Peter and St. Paul
fortress, and obtain their release as
soon as possible.
Nit the slightest disorder was report
ed anywhere during the day. The burial
of more prominent strike victims, which
it was feared might lead to demonstra
tions, occurred, by direction of the po
lice, during the night and early this
morning.
Sir Charles Hardinge, the British
Embassador, to-day called Foreign
Minister Lamsdorff's attention to the
telegram posted at Moscow saying that
the disturbances at the Russian dock
yards and arsenals were due to Anglo-
Japanese instigation, and that both
Great Britain and Japan were spend
ing vast sums to prevent the Russian
Eccond Pacific squadron going to the
Far East. At the same time he point
ed out that a similar telegram appear

valid, the army organ.
Count Lamsdorff assured Embassa
dor Hardinge that such publications
had no official sanction, but added thai,
ho would inquire whether it had been
given an official appearance at Mos

sume the dignity of a diplomatic in
cident.

MOSCOW, Jan. 26.âThe day passed
with complete quiet, the strikers gen
erally remaining indoors and not visit
iojr the heart of the city. The Tverskaia
and other principal thoroughfares have
resumed their normal appearance. Sev
eral mills are reported to have offered
an increase of w ~es to their employes.
A Press correspondent visited the in
dustrial districts to-day and found that
no factories were in operation in the
whole region south of the river, with
the exception of one large establish
ment, which was amply guarded in or
der to-prevent possible intimidation of
workmen; but there was no attempt at
such intimidation.
Although the strike is steadily
spreading, the movement thus far has
not been accompanied by collisions of
great gravity. To-day's events were re
stricted to minor skirmishes on the
northern and eastern outskirts of the
city, in which the troops successfully
resisted all efforts of the crowds to
break through the cordon.
No bloodshed is reported. Both the
authorities and the masters have shown
admirable coolness in the face of the
situation, the former avoiding provo
cation by studiously concealing the
troops, and the latter by displaying a
readiness to meet the men's demands.
During the correspondent's visit to
the factories south of the river, which
employ hundreds of thousdnds of men,
he saw no more than 200 workmen in
the streets, and discovered that the
men were all staying indoors. It ap
pears that when the strikers made the
round of the mills, calling upon their
comrades to quit work under threat of
wrecking the plants, the masters decid
ed to allow the men to take a holiday
with full pay, provided they remained
in their dwellings, and the workmen
generally consented.
Meanwhile the workmen and the
masters are negotiating for a settle
ment of their differences. Several
firms already have offered an advance
in wages, which would bring up the
average earnings of their workmen to
$10 a month and lodgings. One firm
has offered to knock one hour from
the legal workday of eleven hours,
but this is a burning question on
which the majority of the masters are

Executive Tells Ecclesiastics That He

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.âRight Rev.
Doane of Albany and a committee of
the Interchurch Conference on Mar
riage and Divorce called on the Presi
dent to-day to confer with him in re
gard to some of the results of their de
liberations. Bishop Doane, speaking
for the committee, delivered a brief
address to President Roosevelt, to
which the President replied as follows:
Bishop Doane and Gentlemen: It is a very
great pleasure to me to receive you here.
There Is a certain tendency to exalt the un- i
essential In dealing with our public questions,
and public men especially are apt to get their
attention concentrated on questions that have
an importance but wholly ephemeral com
pared with the questions that go straight to
the root of things. Questions like the tariff
and th* currency are of literally no conse
quence whatever compared with the necessity
o: having the unit of our social life, the home,
P'teerved. It is Impossible to overstate the
Importance of the cause you represent.
While I do not know exactly what It is that
you wish me to do, I can say In advance that
eo'far M In me lies all will be done to co
operate with you toward the end you have In
- view. One of the most unpleasant and dan
gerous feature* of our American life Is the
diminishing birth rate and the loosening of
the marital ties, among the old native Ameri
can families. It goes without saying that for
the' race, as for the individual, no material
prosperity, no business growth, no artistic or
sckwitiftc development, will count if the race
commits suicide. Therefore, Bishop, I count
myself fortunate in having the chanc* to work
with- you in this mattep of vital Importance to
tqe national welfare.
ANTI-INJUNCTION BILL.
Measure Favored by President Reg
ulates the Issuance of Writs.
Â° WASHINGTON, Jan. 26âAn import
ant measure which is the result of con
ferences held during the past two
months between President Roosevelt,
Attorney General Moody, Commissioner
of Corporations Garfield and represen
tatives of labor organizations and cor
porate interests, has been introduced in
the House of Representatives by Rep
resentative Jenkins of' Wisconsin. It
provides that in labor disputes an in
junction shall not be' issued until op
portunity shall have been afforded the
adverse party to the proceedings to be
heard by the court, and is intended as
a substitute for measures pending in
â¢ Congress.
Commissioner Garfield to-day made
this explanation of the proposed meas
ure:
The original statute of 1793 provided that a
hearing should be had before the Issuance of
any extraordinary writ. Equity rule 60 aim
ply carried * that provision Into effect In all
Injunction proceedings. Under the revision of
the revised statutes In 1872 the old law was
. so changed as In effect to repeal that part of
â¢ equity rulo 56, requiring the giving of notice
before granting the temporary restraining
order.
The bill Introduced by Representative Jen
kins restores that provision' of the rule which
requires that due notice must be given to the
adverse party in all labor cases before the
writ may issue. Its effect wjll be not to limit
the right of injunction, but to prevent the im
provident granting of writs of injunction by
affording the adverse party an opportunity to
be hfrard before action Is taken by the court.

The alleged "bullfight" was. in pro-1
gress in the Pavilion âwhen the .affair
happened. Policeman Murphy was
detailed by Captain, Anderson oÂ«n.
Woodward avenue, in the rear of - the
Pavilion, to preserve order. On one
occasion a crowd of youths procured a
piece of scantling and started to pry
one of the rear doors open. Murphy
discovered them and drove them away.
Quiet prevailed for a time, but the
boys returned later and Murphy
gave chase. It was at this, time that
young Thompson stumbled while run
ning and struck his head on the pave
ment.
Murphy did everything possible for
the boy and had him removed to the
Central Emergency Hospital. There it
was discovered that the patient could'
not live and he expired a few hours
afterward. Several witnesses were
quoted as having seen MUrphy strike
Thompson, but when these were inter
viewed by Detective Matherson last
night they denied the statement. J. F.
Mullen of 1431 Stevenson street, to
whom Murphy gave the pidee of scant
ling, said that he witnessed the affair
and that the patrolman was simply in
the act of driving the crowd from the
rear of the pavilion. George- A: Hol
land and wife of 48 Woodward ave
nue, who were named as witnesses
against Murphy, say they were in the
pavilion at the time and do not know
what occurred.
Murphy says his attention was first
called to boys attempting to pry open
the door. He drove them away' and
when they returned he made another
attack on the crowd. Thompson, in
attempting to make his . escape,
stumbled and struck his head on the
pavement. 1 Chief Wittman will con
clude the Investigation to-morrow
morning, at which time Officer Mur
phy has been ordered to appear before
him.

"What of the future? People talk of
a revolution or of an era of bomb

"I am optimistic," was the reply. "I
have no fear of a revolution. As for
bomb-throwers, they are few in num

that fashion."
"There are stories of wholesale ar

TROOPS PRESERVE ORDER
AT HUNGARIAN ELECTIONS
Early Returns Indicate That Tisza
Must Relinquish the Reins of
Government,
BUDAPEST, Hungary, Jan. 26.âThe
elections are proceeding throughout the
country with the aid of troops to pre
serve order. No serious disorders -have
yet been reported.
The results reported to-night are too
fragmentary to afford a basis for, pre
diction with certainty, but there are
some Indications that Premier Tisza
will fail to command a majority in the
new Chamber of Deputies sufficiently
large to justify his retention .of the
reins of the Government. The united
opposition parties.have already' cap
tured thirty seats and It looks as
though Tisza, in the new Parliament,
will be compelled to depend for support
on the forty Croatian Deputies Instead,
as formerly, of having a majority of
twenty without the aid of the Croa
tians.
Count Tisza has gained a personal
success against Count Julius Andrassy
in the Fourth District of . Budapest.
Among others elected are Herr Daniel,
author of the famous "Lex Daniel,"
and President Perozell, who secured the
adoption of the law for ending, obstruc
tion in the Chamber of Deputies.
The Liberals have Jost twelve seats
and gained two.

PREDICTS CZAR'S FALL.
George Meredith Believes Russian
Autocracy Is Doomed.
LONDON, Jan. 27.âGeorge Meredith,
the author, in the course of an inter
view given to the Chronicle yesterday,
expressed a strong conviction that the
"long reign of despotism which blocks
Eastern Europe, is slowly but surely
coming to an end."
"The Emperor is a poor, weak crea
ture," said Meredith. "We must all
pity him in his fall. He has no will
of his own, but as for the Grand Dukes,
'they are the enemies of human kind.
Nobody in the world will regret their
disappearance. They are the real
authors of the terrible events in St.
Petersburg and Moscow. We know
now that it is the bureaucracy, with
the Grand Dukes at its head, that
rules Russia.
"By meeting the petitioners the Em
peror might have averted bloodshed
and delayed revolution for a few years;
but nothing, I imagine, can now pre
vent the' early downfall of the Govern
ment I do not think the rising will be
Immediately successful. The revolu
tionaries are scattered and have few
leaders. The poor creatures cannot
hope to resist the troops. If.the latter
remain loyal to their superstition, the
revolution will be crushed now, but not
killed.
"I think events will take the follow
ing course: The strike will stop prepar
ations for carrying on the war; the
"necessity of dragooning the people into
submission will prevent reinforcing the
army in Manchuria; Kuropatkin. with
reinforcements and supplies cut off,
will have no choice but to attempt a I
stroke which, I am convinced, will fall; ;
the failure will send back a wave upon '
St. Petersburg which will overwhelm
the Emperor and the Grand Dukes. In
that way the revolution will be ef
fected."
!In conclusion, Meredith contended:
that it is Impossible that Russia can :
long escape the spirit of liberalism
that has overswept Europe, and said:
"The Emperor's message, like him- :
self, is weak. It means nothing, after I
the appointment of such a man as !
Trepoff. Sympathizing Englishmen j
should give practical support in the
shape of money to the Russian re
i. formers."

ROBBERS MAKE A MIDNIGHT
CALL ON SALOONMAN DISIER
They Lock Him In Room and Then
Ransack the Premises, bnt
Fail to Get Much Money.
Two masked highwaymen entered
! the saloon of Jules Disler at the
! southeast corner of Oak and Frank
j lin streets shortly before midnight.
Disier was preparing to close up the
saloon for the night. One of the doors
of the saloon on Franklin street had
been locked and EWsier was about to
lock the other when two men wear
ing black masks covered him With re
volvers. One of the robbers searched
Disier and took $14 from his pocket.
Disier resisted the men and they
shoved him into a little room in the
rear\ of the saloon.
The robber ransacked the place and
took $6 more from the cash register.
As Disier was thrown into the room,
he locked the door from the inside. The
men evidently feared that Disier would
gain an exit to the street and give an
alarm. One of the masked men broke
the glass door and pointed his revolver
at Disier. As he did this the grftty
saloonman struck the highwayman
! over the wrist with a broomstock. See
ing the determined effort Disier was
making to expose them and fearing
that some passerby might be attracted
to the scene, the men hastily left.
Disier finally succeeded in climbing
through the glass door. He notified Po
liceman Lane, who was-on duty in that
vicinity.

SHARP INTERCHANGE MARKS
DUNSMUIR WILL CONTEST
Sir Charles H. Tapper and J. f.
Dwyer Have Several Acrlmonsoua
Encounters.
The cross-examination 'of I. J.
Dwyer, expert on California pro but a
law, was continued yesterday by SID
Charles H. Tupper in the hearing of
the Dunsmuir will contest, before
Consul General Courtenay Bennett at
the British consulate. Frequent
"spats" occurred between the witness
and his questioner, but otherwise the
testimony was of a routine character.
To-day Dwyer will be taken In band
by E. V. BodwelL It Is expected that
his testimony will continue for several
days. Following the hearing of
Dwyer J. A. S. Low will be recalled for
the purpose of asking whether he
has made the statement during the
present hearing, that-when he wit
nessed the Dunsmuir will he dldnt
know the nature of the document.
This question was asked Low at the
first hearing, and he said he knew It
was a will that he witnessed, but did
not understand its provisions. An at
tempt will b* made to show that ho.
has subsequently acknowledged to
outsiders that he did not know it
was a will.
REPLIES TO CRITICISM
RELATING TO AMENDMENTS
Commission Declares It Did Not In
troduce Proposed Changes in
Election Laws,
The Election Commission yesterday
issued a statement in answer to the
criticisms that it had introduced in
the Legislature certain amendments
calculated to promote frauds in elec
tion matters. The statement says that
the amendments, which are of a trivial
character, were introduced by em-
Reg istrar Walsh to make certain un
important changes in the election
laws, so that they would be ap
plicable to the entire States The
amendments were, not acted upon,
and Chief Deputy Registrar Ze
mansky had them reintroduced
at the present session, deeming them
necessary to the uniformity of elec
tion laws in this State.

Show Any Signs
of Anxiety.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Jan. 26.âThe trial of
Adolph Weber accused' of murderine
his mother began here this morninc
before Superior Judge J. PreweHt.
The courtroom which is one of the
largest on the Pacific coast was crowd
ed to suffocation. Promptly at 10
o'clock Weber walked into the court
room between Sheriff Charles Keena
and Under Sheriff William May. He
was cool, calm and collected. Impris
onment has greatly improved his ap
pearance. He took a survey of the
i.rowd of spectators as he entered the
room and then seated himself behind
his counsel. Grove L. Johnson. F. P.
Tuttle. B. P. Tabor and Samuel J. Pul
len. Never since his arrest has Weber
seemed to be so much at ease.
Among the spectators were Mrs. E.
C. Snowden and Mrs. Charles Hess,
sisters of the murdered woman. At
intervals they gave way to tears.
The prosecution will be conducted by
Attorney General U. S. Webb, with
whom is associated Kelly Robinson and
<>. W. Hamilton. The day was given up
entirely to the empaneling of a jury.
'>f the first twelve talesmen called
from the regular panel, two were ac
cepted and sworn in to try the case.
They are T. J. Wall of Goldrun. and T.
W. Berry of Sheridan. It is the im-'
pression here that the jury will be
soie'-ted by Saturday morning.
The hotels are crowded with persons
from all parts of the county, drawn
h-=re by interest in the case. There is
but onÂ» topic of conversation in the
town and that is the Weber tragedy.
Mrs. Snowden in speaking of the case
to-day said: 'The trial brings back to
me all the horrible events of the awful
night that my dear ones were murder
ed. I cannot tell you the awful agony
lam suffering. My husband has never
recovered from the awful shock of see
ing the bodies of my sister's family
brought out from the burning home. I
do not think any of us will ever fully
recover from the terrible blow."
The work of impaneling a jury will
be resumed to-day.

Success of Fred Terry and
Wife. Julia Neilson, Due!
to American Playwrights
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Jan. 26.â1t looks as if Lon
don would see Paul Kester s play,
"Sweet Dorothy of the Hall," much
sooner than was originally expected.
And this because, to ail appearances,
Fred Terry and his wife, Julia Neilson,
are unable to find fortune In any piece
that is not American in either author
ship or theme. This capable theatrical
couple struck it rich with Kester's
"Sweet Nell of Old Drury." which filled
first the Globe and then the Haymarket
for months. After that, however, they
came a cropper with a home-made play
called "The Heel of Achilles," which
had an inglorious career lasting about
a week, whereupon the Terrys fell back
upon "Sweet Nell" and played it in the
provinces for a while, but eventually
came back to town i.o have another try
at the Shaftesbury with an English
play called "For Sword or Song." Bad
luck again, and another provincial tour
with the Nell Gwynn piece, at the end
of which the couple produced "Sun
day," a charming little drama of the
Far West, in which Ethel Barrymore
recently appeared at home. It must be
said that Miss Neilson was by no means
at her happiest in the part of the hero
ine of "Sunday," but the appeal made
to audiences by the scenes in the mm
I ers' cabin kept the play on at the
! Comedy for several months. After that
it went on the road, and during this
provincial trip the Terrys tried "Sweet
Dorothy of the Hall." which is, of
course, adapted by Kester from the
novel "Dorothy Vernon" and which one
I imagines has been seen at home. It
! scored ouite unmistakably, but Miss
Neilson "and her husband were under
contract to produce "The Scarlet Pim
pernel" as soon as they got back to
town, and so the American play was
j shelved for the time being. But al
though "The Scarlet Pimpernel"âwhose
title is not the name of an unpleasant
disease, but that of a flowerâis from
the aristocratic pens of a Baroness and
her husband, it has come In for a vig
orous slating and seems likety to give
way to "Sweet Dorothy" before many
moons.
HACKNEYED SUBJECT.
The play is all about an Englishman
of title in Paris during the revolution,
who tries to rescue several French aris
tocrats from the Terror, but who only
succeeds In getting himself suspected
of infamous intrigue by hie own wife
and son. Of course, all is right when
the final curtain falls, but the piece Is
amateurish and unconvincing and not
worth any detailed description.
Seymour Hicks seems to have learned
just how to do It. It looks the easiest
| trick in the world to build a modern
' musical comedy, but the number of en
' tertainments of this kind that fall flat
lin London every season proves that
there is a decided "knack" about con
structing them. That Hicks has that
knack there seems no doubt. After
several years of popularity as a come
! dian at the Gaiety and one or two un
der Frohman's management he tried
his 'prentice hand at writing Christmas
entertainments for children and

ANGEL ISLAND STATION.
Immigration Commissioner Tells of

â¢ WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.âFrank P.
Sargent, Commissioner General of
Immigration, was heard to-day by
the House Committee on Appropria
tions. Sargent presented the neces
sity of permanent improvements for
the immigration service at New Or
leans and San Francisco.
' At Ellis Island !t is desired to con
struct a contagious hospital at an es
timated cost of $250,000 and a $12,000
water purification plant. At San Fran
cisco there is needed an immigration
station, plans for which have been
made, the station to be constructed on
Angel Island, at a cost of $250,000.
Cherry' Girl," were the result. These
Hicks followed up with "The Earl and
the Girl," a sure-enough musical com
edy, which ended a year's run only a
few weeks ago, and which Is to be pro
duced in the United States pretty soon.
CONTINUED SUCCESS.
It seemed then as if It were about
time for the young actor-author to
draw a blank, but no, "The Catch of
the Season," which Hicks wrote with
Cosmo Hamilton, Is the biggest kind of
a hit at the Vaudeville and is sure to
be exported sooner or later for the en
tertainment of American audiences.
While he was working on this play
Hicks was also occupying himself with
a musical comedy to serve as a succes
sor to "The Earl and the Girl," and
this piece, which is called "The Talk of
the Town," recently saw the light at
the Lyric. It caught on Instantly, not
because the story was especially origi
nal, the Jokes especially new or the
music especially good, but* because the
whole thing was put on in exactly the
right way and played for all it was
worth by clever people. It will go in
America, too.
The hero is a young aristocrat who
has spent all his money. He has a
friend, however, who has Just learned
that he is heir to a huge fortune and
who has promised to give Reggie
Drummond $75,000. The plutocratic
friend, whose name is Hambledon, is
not to arrive in London for a week and
meanwhile a bailiff named Snipe is
sent to take possession of Drummond's
big house. Now it happens that Snipe
is a former valet of Drummond and
devoted to the young man, and in order
to keep the "duns" at bay he consents
to impersonate the coming Hambledon.
Complications naturally follow, espe
cially as the money Hambledon thinks
is his really belongs to Ellaline Lewin,
the pretty heroine of the play. Walter
Passmore. the former comedian of the
Savoy, is screamingly funny as the
bailiff masquerading as a millionaire,
a part of which some American funny
man will also doubtless make good use.
MILES' FRIENDS
WIN THE FIGHT
Senate Modifies Provision
in Army Bill Aimed
at the Veteran General
PERKINS STIRS ALGER
â¦
Former Secretary of War
Resents Statement Con
cerning Sale of Transports
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.âThe Senate i
to-day passed the army appropriation
bill after modifying the provision con
cerning the assignment of retired army
officers to active service with militia
organizations. The effect of the change
Is to relieve General Miles from its ap
plication.
Gallinger and others criticized the
amendment regulating the sale of army
transports, claiming that the use of
Government vessels forced unfair com
petition upon the owners of private
vessels. Bale condemned the operation
of the general staff system in the army j
and said he would oppose any effort to
establish a similar system in the navy.
Perkins of California supported the
amendment requiring Congressional in
dorsement before selling transports,
saying that if it should be necessary
to buy in time of emergency high prices
would have to be paid. In the Spanish
war more had been paid, he said, for
transports than they were worth.
Alger, who was Secretary of War at
that time, warmly said:
"I would like a bill of particulars. We
bought no ships at that time except
upon the advice of the best shipbuild
ers and I feel that the business end of
the transaction was properly cared
for."
Perkins disclaimed any to
reflect upon the War or Navy depart
ment.
The amendment was agreed to, as
was the amendment striking out the
House provision prohibiting the use of
private vessels in the transportation of
Government supplies to the Philippines.
When the Senate reverted to the con
sideration of the House provision regu
lating the pay of retired ofneeus as
signed to active service. Lodge read
the following telegram to him from the
Governor of Ohio:
Ohio is deeply Interested in the army appro
priation bill. If it lÂ« desired to humiliate Uen
eral M'les in whkh we have no sympathy
here it shculd not include splendid army offi
cers on the retired list who are rendering splen
did service to ttv; Na.lonal Guard In different
states Wo ar<- especial! v favored In Ohio, and
deeply' interested. MYRON T. HERRK K.
The amendment was modified at
Lodge's suggestion and was passed as
follows:
Rjtired officers of the army above the grade
of major shall, when hereafter assigned loa.l
ive duty in connection with the organized mili
tia in the several States and Territories upon
the request of the Government hereof, receive
their full retired pay. and also commutation of
tiuarters. unle.-s Government quarters are avail
able, and shell receive no further pay or allow
ances. Provlde.l. further, that a lieutenant
colonel so aaalgned ahill receive the full pay
ment and allowances rf Â» ma/or on the active
list.
ISLAND SUGAR TARIFF.
Louisiana Sugar Planters Oppose
Proposed Reduction.
WASHINGTON*. Jan. 26.âJames D.
Hill, sneaking for the Louisiana sugar
planters before the House Committee
on Ways and Means, to-day opposed
the proposed reduction of tariff on
sugar from the Philippines to 25 per
cent of the Dingley rates. He urged
that the reduction of the tariff on
Philippine sugar would increase the
products of the islands, where the
sugar can be grown at a much less
cost than in the United States.
Representative Boutelle of Illinois,
quoting a newspaper, that the only
enemy sugar need have fear of was
the tariff tinker and the reciprocity
crank, asked Hill if he subscribed to
that view. Hill said that,Vif not of
fensive to the committee, he would
say "yes."

They have been removed to Ancon Hospital.
It Is not safe to remove the three cases re
ported this morning. Drs. Perry and Pierce

There are seven cases in all.
Prompt action was taken by the

i will be amended to admit Oklahoma

This movement finds favor, of course,
on the Democratic* side. Senator Gor

success.
I Senator Hard announced to-day to
I friends that he would vote for such
' measure. He believes that the vast
i interests of the West, so little under

; which interests will grow as time

Ninety-Five Years Old and

From New York to Coast
HELPED BY KINDLY MEN
Nonagenarian's One Wish
Is to Pass His Remain

Special Dispatch to The Call.
j DENVER, Jan. 26.âNinety-five years
old and without a nickel, C. E. Row of
347 West One Hundred and Forty-first
street. New York city, a veteran of the
civil war, is making his way alone
across the continent from New York
to San Francisco. He Is stopping in
Denver for a rest before Journeying on.
Pluck personified is this old soldier.
Added to the infirmities of age, he is
afflicted with locomotor ataxia, has
lost the sight of one eye and is deaf.
For years his one dream has been to
make California his home. On the 11th
of this month he decided to start and
with the confidence of a child that hs
would be cared for in some way, hs
kissed ""his aged wife good-by and be
gan the Journey.
It has been a long story of ups and
downs âsometimes long hungry days
and nights on a depot bench and some
times in a palace car with the diner
!at his disposal, but everywhere he has
i found a helping hand. He earned &
dollar selling pencils and this supplied
his needs as far as Chicago, a railroad
friend passing him to that point. Thers
he sold soap in office buildings and
earned several dollars.
While wandering about he was in
vited to Join a 10-cent museum as ons
of the "freaks." The manager offered
him $35 a week for two weeks to do the
"Methusalem act" for the show.
"I would not stay in Chicago for $450
a week," was the retort of the aged
pilgrim.
He secured another pass from a kind
hearted railroad man and resumed his
Journey. -
The old man received many calls
from Grand Army veterans to-day and
was then in fine spirits. He says that
j when he gets to California he will send
for his wife, settle down and try to
j save a little money for his old age.

begun to-day. Judge R. W. Tayler
of Ohio, who has conducted the case
for the protestants. opened.
Judge Tayler reminded the com
mittee that it had been a year since

make could not be fitted to serve in
the highest legislative branch of the
Government.

REVISION OF THE CODES
â¦
Lower House to Meet Wed
nesday Evenings to Con
sider Suggested Changes
SpociaJ Dispatch to The Call.
. SACRAMENTO, Jan. 26.âThe As
sembly this morning took action that
assures the passing by that body at
this session of all the code revision bills
prepared by Code Commissioner John
F. Davis. There were a few members
of the House who had felt that the As
sembly would not have time to take up
the bills and that an extra session
would have to be called to pass them.
On motion of McCartney, seconded by
McGowan, the lower House adopted a
resolution that every Wednesday even
ing during the reÃt of the session, from
the hour of 7:30 to 10, be devoted to
reading and passing these bills.
. The bill providing for an appropria
tion of $70,000 for the Lewis and Clark
Exposition at Portland is now ready for
the Governor. On the ground that it
was an urgency measure, the As
sembly dispensed with its second and
third reading and placed it, on final
passage. The Senate has already
p&ss&ii it*
Waste's bill No. 640 and Treadwell's
No. 92, relating to the employes of the
new Courts of Appeal, were, on motion
of Waste, referred to the Judiciary
Committee as a special committee, with
instructions to report on them to-mor
row. Waste said many telegrams ask
ing that the bill be passed at once as
the new courts were soon to be In ex
istence had been received.
The bill fathered by the Supreme
Court, according to the statement of
Assemblyman Duryea, providing that
examinations of applicants for lawyers'
certificates shall be held by the new
Courts of Appeal was passed.
At the afternoon session the bill in
creasing the salaries of the San Fran
cisco Superior Judges to $6000 a year
was passed without opposition.
The bill adding three Judges to the
Superior bench of Los Angeles was al
lowed to go over by its author, Houser,
when it was called for final passage. It
will take forty-four votes to pass it and
there were only fifty-seven members
present.
Thompson's bill providing* that all
community property not given to one
party or the other at the time of grant
ing a final decree of divorce should go
to the party in whose name it stood at
the time of entering the decree was
beaten after a fight made on it by
Coghlan of San Francisco. Community
property usually stands in the name of
the husband and the proposed law
would work a hardship on the wife
whenever there was an oversight in the.
matter of partitioning it, when so held.
. Espey's bill which provides for one
probation officer and five deputies for
San Francisco, one probation officer
and one deputy for Los Angeles and
one probation officer for Alameda
County, the salaries being $125 and $100
a month respectively, was passed.
Stanton's bills providing for the en
forcement of the laws against the pol
lution of ice and water were passed.
Prescott's joint resolution in favor of
submitting the matter of the Joint
statehood of Arizona and New Mexico
to a vote of the people of those Terri
tories was adopted.
STOCKTON TAXPAYERS VOTE
AGAINST ISSUING BONDS
Propositions* to Buy a Site and Erect
a New City Hall Are Defeated at
the Polls.
STOCKTON, Jan. 26.âAt a quiet
and uneventful election to-day on the
questions of buying a site and erect
ing a city hall both propositions were
lost. It was proposed to vote $20,000
bonds for the purchase of a site, but
; owing to a sentiment in favor of
building, if at all, on one of the
squares now owned by the city, the
situation was complicated.
, The proposition to sell $150,000
bonds for the building of a city hall
was lost by sixteen votes. The city at
present occupies leased quarters in
the county courthouse, but the county
wants the room. Just what will now
be done unless the landlord relents is
a question.

gan and Carl Wilson, two of the young
men implicated in the $20,000 diamond
rcbbery at the Hotel Maryland last
Friday, were held to-day to answer
before the Superior Court. Both ad
mitted all of the important facts in
the case and are expected to plead
guilty in the higher court. Doyle, the
third member of the gang, will be al
lowed to go free, having turned State's
evidence.

MANY IMPORTANT MEASURES
CO BEFORE THE SENATE.
Duplicates of the Sherman
Anti-Trust Law Are .
Introduced.
Shorter Hours for Firemen
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 26.âDuplicates
of the Sherman anti-trust law were in
troduced to-day by Qreenwell In the
Senate and Perkins in the Assembly.
The purpose of including this provi
sion, that has so well demonstrated its
; efficiency, in the California statutes is
j to more easily insure the prosecution of
the smaller try of offenders the Gov-
I ernmeht cannot afford to proceed
: against and to insure their punishment
' under the general laws denning misde-
I meanors.
The bills introduced to-day make it
I unlawful for persons or corporations to
! enter into combinations of any kind
: that will operate in restraint of trade,
violations of which are declared in the
proposed act to be misdemeanors and
punishable as such by tine and impris
onmtflt in county jaiis. It is expected
1 that the passage ot this act will better
enable California to exercise what may
!be termed its police powers in this re
i gard and relieve the Federal Govern
ment of this burden, that it may turn
its attention to districts where more
flagrant violations of the Sherman act
are known to exist.
It was given out this evening that
Greenwell's measure is aimed directly
at the Wholesale Grocers' Association
of California, the southern section of
the combination in particular. It is
said that the wholesalers of the north
and the wholesalers of the south have
an agreement "not to infringe upon each
other's territory and to stand together
to prevent outsiders or others that may
want to come into the State to engage
,in this business from interfering. The
I hardware dealers also have a combina
-1 tion, it is said by the proponents of the
j bill, that can be reached if the measure
I becomes a law of the State.
A series of equally interesting bills
were introduced in the Senate this
j morning by Nelson of San Francisco
relating to lotteries. The bills are
j amendatory of the present statutes re-
I garding the conduct of lotteries and the
aiding and abetting thereof, the only
change being that they increase the
! penalty for violations of the statutes,
I making such felonies instead of misde
j meanors.
SHORTER HOURS FOR FIREMEN*
! Wolfe's bill reducing to twelve a day
I the hours of regular service of the
members of the San Francisco firemen,
amended by Savage so as to include
1 the Los Angeles department, was flnal-
Ilv passed by the Senate to-day, but not,
I until after Carter of Los Angeles had
! protested on the ground that he had
i received a letter from one of the 300
I members of the department of the
southern "city requesting that he oppose
the amendment. Carter further said
that he had not been consulted regard
ing the measure by Senator Savage,
who comes from San Pedro, but Savage
firmly maintained that his colleague
was mistaken; that he had consulted
with him and that Savage had said: "I
am with you on this question." Carter
had nothing further td say against the
bill, but asked that it go over for a
week to enable him to investigate the
matter. He was defeated in his effort
to delay matters, however, the bill be
ing put to a vote and carried.
While, as Senatqr Wolfe explained,
the bill may be in opposition to the
provisions of the charter of San Fran
cisco the same is true of the bill re
ducing the hours of policemen to eight
hours a day, but no one has protested,
being willing to overlook the conflict
between charter and legislative act in
osder that the policemen may enjoy
life as much as the most favored citi
zen, Instead of being slaves of the
Government. It is said that the Board
of Fire Commissioners of San Francis
co favors the act and will immediately
put it into force unless some citizen,
being more fully alive to his duty to
I the State than in his sympathy for his
fellow man, carries the question to the
courts and secures a decision declaring
the bill unconstitutional.
SALARIES OF JUSTICES.
Assemblyman McGowan's bill in
creasing the salaries of the Justices of
the Peace of San Francisco from $2400
to $3600 a year was taken up by the
Senate and Anally passed. It only
awaits the Governor's signature before
it will become a law. Wolfe explained
the bill in the Senate this morning, say
ing it only affected San Francisco and
that the men in San Francisco were en
titled to the increase as they were over
burdened with work and had proved
themselves most efficient. The present
Justices of the Peace will not enjoy
the increase, the constitutional provi
sion preventing the Increase of offi
cials* salaries during their terms of of
fice operating against them.
, Senator Hahn's bill relating to ver
dicts of Juries was finally passed by the
Senate this morning. This bill provides
that in an action for the recovery of
money only or specific real property,
â  the Jury, unless Instructed by the court
to render a special verdict, may at their
discretion render a general or special
verdict. Upon the request of any of
the parties in writing, however, the
court must direct the jury to find a
special verdict upon all or any of the
issues. The purpose of the bill is to
[ take from the courts the matter of dis
cretion in relation to special verdicts
| and makes it mandatory upon them to
>. ordec. special verdicts if so directed by
counsel.
PROTECTION OF CHILDREN.
The Senate also finally passed
Hahn's bill relating to the protection
from immoral influences of children
under 18 years of age; Simpson's bills
relating to pleadings in Justices'
eourtÃ, to notice of trial before Jus
tices of the Peace and to the defend
ant's pleadings in Justices' courts, all
regulating the manner of practice;
Sanford's bill relating to the disposi
tion of lands deeded to the State for
non-payment of State and county
taxes; Selvage's act relating to ap
peals; Sanford's act prohibiting the
sale of intoxicating liquors- within a
certain distance of the , Mendocino
State Hospital for the Insane, and
Ward's bill providing for the work on
streets, sidewalks and sewers within
municipalities.
Ward's bill appropriating $4333 75
for the payment of the claim against
the State for official duties performed
THE. SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. JANUARY 27, 1905.
THAT IS INTRODUCED IN THE LEGISLATURE BY SENATOR NELSON
makes it a felony to either purchase or to sell tickets
by John F. Forward, County Recorder j
of San Diego County, was also passed.
Senator Ward explained that Forward
had done much work for the State at |
his own expense, there being no pro- j
vision in the San Diego County law
under which he could collect and his
onfly remedy was to secure relief from
the Legislature. The Senate has now
passed his claim and the Assembly
will take it up shortly.
Among other bills presented this aft
ernoon were a series by Pendleton ex
tending the rights of the people in ac
tions in eminent domain. The bill ex- I
tends the right to the utilization by the
people of any county of waters lm
pounded or In reservoirs within the
borders of their county. If carried,
these measures would enable the peo
pie of San Mateo to compel the Spring
Valley Water Company to supply the
towns of the county from the system
now used exclusively for San Francisco,
and would operate in many like oases.
It is quite probable that the bills will
create a flght on the floor.
FILE IT TAKEN UP.
The introduction of bills completed
for the day, the file was again taken
up. Wolfe's bill regulating the employ
ment and hours of labor of children,
prohibiting the employment of minors
under certain ages and prohibiting the
employment of illiterate minors was
finally passed. This bill will do much
toward relieving children that have
been the victims of the "sweat shop"
system.
Wolfe, who introduced a bill yester
day modifying the system by which
electors are identified at the time of
registration, withdrew the same to-day.
He explained to the Senate that he had
Introduced the bill at the instance of
others and had not given it the closest
attention. He was told, however, that
it simply eliminated the objectionable
features in the present law, such as a
record of scars, height and color of
eyes, as required in criminal identifica
tion systems, and substituted therefor
the system of signatures, that bankers
have found to sufflcieutly protect them.
He had heard, however, that there wtu
objection to the bill on the ground that
Jt would make fraud easier, and while
he might hold, a dhferent opinion he
was wiliin'gTo yield, hencS would with
draw the bill.
The Senate again met to-night, but
after a few code revision bills were
read the second tlms adjournment was
taken.
Compromise on School Fund Measure.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 26.âA compro
mise has been reached in the matter of
legislation upon the apportionment of
the school fund. It will not be made
on a basis of the number of teachers
and a measure framed on a plan to be
worked out by H. A. Mason, expert for
the San Francisco Board of Supervis
ors, will take the place of the Rowell-
Slavin bill. The plan is to give the
country districts 10 per cent of the
money at the beginning of the school
year, the balance to be apportioned ac
cording to the number of census chil
dren. Even under this plan San Fran
cisco may lose $90,000 a year.
To Extend Legislative Sessions.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 26.âThe consti
tutional amendment introduced by
Stanton changing the law covering the
sessions of the Legislature was ap
proved by the Committee on Constitu
tional Amendments to-night, but in a
somewhat different form. As it will be
reported to the House to-morrow it will
provide for an eighty-day session, to
begin February 1 every second year.
The salary of the members will be fixed
at $10 a day, and the limit of expense
for employes of each house will be $450
a day.
Bill Is Aimed at Professors.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 26.â W. W. Gil
lette, a dealer In fertilizing material at
Berkeley, had a bill introduced in the
Legislature this morning to provide
against professors and assistants of the
University of California from preju
dicial interference in matters of com
petitive commerce and the performance
of private work for pay, using univer
sity time, supplies and apparatus, and
to provide penalties for the enforce
ment thereof.
Discuss Prison Reforms.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 26.âA Joint
meeting of the Senate and Assembly;
committees on State Prisons and Re
formatories was held in the Assembly
Chamber to-night for the purpose of
discussing the subject of revising the
prison system of California, Robert T.
Devlin of the State Board of Prison
Directors said that the present prison
system was a disgrace to the State and
was worthy of the middle ages, but not
of modern times.
Senatorial Deadlock in Washington.
OLYMPIA, Wash., Jan. 26.âThe

GIVES REBUKE
TO FAKE CLUBS
William Greer Harrison Ap
pears Before Legislative
Committee at Sacramento
DENOUNCES SUPERVISORS
Says Pugilism Is Degrading
and Wrecking the Lives
of San Francisco Youths
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 26.âWilliam
Greer Harrison, president of the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco, to-night
I addressed a joint meeting of the Senate
and Assembly committees on public
morals on behalf of Ralston's anti-prize
fight bill. In unsparing terms he paint
i ed the picture of the moral degradation
! that has followed the progress of the
, game of pugilism in the metropolis and
ihe asked the legislators to put a stop
,' forever to the degrading sport. Hs also
poured some hot shot into the Board
of Supervisors of San Francisco.
"In San Francisco," he said, "there
I are men that operate under the guise
that they are directors of amateur ath
i letic associations, but whose sole pur
pose is to use their gold to debauch the
* young men of the city that they may
make more gold. The Olympic Club of
San Francisco has been forced to close
; its doors on outside boxers because of
their illegitimate conduct. Within the
last year we have lost four of our best
i boxers, who have become professionals.
; These are: Berger, Finnigan, Murray
and Kearns, Murray and Kearns an
! nounced openly that they were going
into boxing as professionals, but we
were compelled to take action against
Berger and Finnigan because they
fought professional fights at the in-
I stance of a fake athletic club. There
! is not a member of any of this class of
j clubs 'that cannot be bought for $10,
and they are rapidly destroying the
love of legitimate athletics.
"I am here to protest against this
disease that is destroying the moral
characters of so many young men of
our city. When we found that we
were educating bruisers, a condition
brought about by this illegitimate out
side influence, we found that it was
time that we gave up boxing tourna
ments. I dare say that fully 75 per
cent of the professional fights that
have taken place in San Francisco
were frauds upon the public and the
people of the city. The money these
professionals have made has lured
young men from their homes and from
the athletic home. It is a question
that should interest every father in
the State. Who knows what young
man may fail to attain the highest of
fice in the land through this most
baneful influence.
"I appeared recently before the Po
lice Committee of the Board of Super
visors and requested that they regu
late these fights. Then I went before
the whole board, but In vain. The Su
pervisors would not* take action against
these fakers and every one knows the
reason why. I asked them to place a
license of $1000 on every fight, profes
sional and so-called amateur, stating
that I would put up $2000 for every
tournament the Olympic Club gave,
but still they refused and, of course,
they had a reason."
Senator Curtin said that while he
agreed fully with Mr. Harrison, he was
not in favor of Ralston's bill as drafted,
as it restricted boxing contests to mem
bers of the American Athletic Associa
tion, though he appreciated that these
contests were not held for money mak
ing purposes. Senator Anderson also
objected to this provision in the bill,
but said that he would heartily support
a law that would prohibit absolutely
the holding of any contests to witness
which an admission fee was charged.
It was agreed that this would have the
effect of putting a stop, not pnly to pro
fessional, but to the so-called amateur
contests. When the committee reports
to the Senate such a measure will be
recommended for adoption.
FABBRI-MUELLER BENEFIT

were two by Caro Roma, "Love's Sac
rifice" and "The Return," and the
enad scene aria from "Hamlet," by
Thomas. Caro Roma and Fred Mau
rer accompanied. Mme. Francisca
delivered her numbers with much
of artistic finish and purity of tone.
Of the Roma composition, "The Re
turn" is the more brilliant. "Ths
Last Rose" was sung beautifully, with
great pathos and delicacy. In addi
tion to the Roma songs that Francis
ca sang there was another Roma num
ber on the programme, "Violets," sung
by Miss Emma Dahlberg, whose con
tralto was heard to advantage in this
and also in "Oh, Dry Those Tears;"
by Del Riego, accompanied by Miss
Phoebe Durrant.
Besides the music there were three
dramatic performances. Josephine

FAILS TO OBEY
THE SUBPENA
Secretary of Building and
Loan Association in Con
tempt of the Legislature
COMMITTEE IS WRATHY
Resolution to Cite Him Be
fore Bar of the Senate Will
Be Introduced To-Day
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 26.âWilliam
Corbin, secretary of the Continental
Building and Loan Association of San
Francisco, did not appear before the
Senate Committee on Commissions and
Retrenchments this afternoon. He had
been subpenaed to appear, and when
the members of the committee con
templated his disregard of its authority
they became belligerent and threats of
the bastile for Corbin and other pun
ishments were freely made.
The members of the committee
sought out President Anderson and re
quested that a warrant forthwith issue
for Corbin's arrest. They were in
formed, however, that such action
could not be taken without the consent
of the entire upper house expressed in
vote upon resolution. A resolution to
this effect will be presented in* the Sen
ate to-morrow.
Captain Stratton of San Francisco
was the only witness to appear before
the committee to-day. His only com
plaint was that the Continental Build
ing and Loan Association loaned him
money with which to erect a home,
telling him, he alleged, that he could
.pay the money back when he wanted
to, but subsequently, when he failed to
live up to the terms of the trust deed
placed in his possession, the corpora
tion dispossessed him of his home. The
committee held that this fact had no
bearing on the investigation in hand,
which goes only to the question of the
solvency of the association under in
vestigation.

B Thus writes one of the greatest living singers, a woman of the most refined and most es> B
B acting musical taste. B
B The Kohler ft Chase piano well deserves this latest triumph. For years it has been the) I
B idol of the Pacific Coast musiciansâmen and women whose names have gone abroad to the B
S credit of California; men like Herman Genss. the late Otto Bendix, Otto Fleissner, Emlyn B
H Lewys, Ferdinand Stark, Frederick Zech Jr., Cantor E. J. Stark, Arthur Fickensher and many B
H more. The piano which has created so much enthusiasm is certainly worthy of your considers- Ih
H tion * B
IP A Word AbOUtÂ» Years ago Kohler ft Chase first started to solve the problem of producing B
B The Piano Itself, a piano which musically and mechanically could compare with the very B
HI best, which would be so solidly constructed that the trying climates of the Pacific Coast would pi
not affect it, and which could be sold at the price usually obtained for the so-called medium
mi priced instruments.
a| In accomplishing this task we were fortunate enough to have at our command one of the |||
H most experienced and competent corps of /xpert piano men in the entire United States. In ad- Â§1
9 dition we have had the co-operation of one of the oldest and most celebrated of the nigh- m
W. grade piano manufacturers, whom we selected to carry out our -ideas and designs in building the B
ffr piano. Thus the Kohler ft Chase piano is the product of the best thought and study of the best B

The enthusiastic indorsement of the piano by the highest musical authorities. has been Â¥m
M/b especially gratifying to us. The Kohler ft Chase is admired and USED by practically every Â§jg

DIVORCE LAWS
TO BE AMENDED
Bill Is Introduced Making
Insanity a Ground for a
Severance of Marital Ties
ESPEY GIVES HIS VIEWS
Assemblyman From Alameda
Says That Too Many Mar
riages Are Made in Haste
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 26.âInsanity
is made ground for a divorce under a
i bill introduced to-day by Assembly
i man Espey of Alameda, The measure
! provides that the marriage ties may
jbe severed upon proof by the plain
j tiff that the defendant has been suf
| fering for three years or more, sub
sequent to the marriage, with "incur
j able chronic mania or dementia." It
is provided that in such cases the
I District Attorney shall represent the
I defendant if no one else appears in
: the latter's behalf.
i Assemblyman Espey says he be
-1 lleves the way to reduce the number
!of divorces is to - make marriage
harder.
"Divorce is becoming a great evil."
he says. "In Alameda County one
third of the suits filed the last year
were for divorce. If people didn't get
married with such haste in some cases
there would be less to regret after
ward and fewer divorce suits. I am
in favor of McCartney's bill placing
restrictions upon the securing of mar
riage licenses and providing that mar
riages shall take place in the county
where o'he or the other of the parties
resides. If I had my way, L think I
would establish the old law fbr the
publication of banns. No, I am not
going to introduce any bill providing
for such publication."
McCartney's first bill relating to the
"obtaining of marriage licenses and to
marriage having been sat down upon
in committee, he has eliminated all
that part regarding licenses and intro
duced a new one containing only the
provision that marriages shall take
place at the residence of one of the
parties. This, too, will probably be
killed. One of its principal opponents
is Assemblyman Bates of Alameda. He
draws a word picture that should stop
the progress of a dozen such bills.
"Supposing," he said, "a young man
were coming from the East and at Cin
cinnati or any other place where they
have them a pretty girl should get or
with her folks, who were making a
trip to California. Supposing the young
man and the pretty girl should mccl
and it should be a case of love at flrsi
sight. By the time they reached Sar
Francisco the proposal would hav<
been made and they would want to gel
married. Could you call the hotel the
residence of either? Would it be right
to have a law that would prevent those
fluttering young hearts from being
Joined?
"Then there are cases of engaged
couples from other States making Cal
ifornia a common meeting ground for
the purpose of being married. They
have no residence here. I shall oppose
any effort to cast obstacles in the way
of romances of the heart. They are
outside the pale of legislation."
Books are powerless to help you un
less you read them.
PAWNBROKING
REGULATIONS
Bill Intended to Correct
Evils of Existing System
Is Introduced in Senate
IS SWEEPING IX SCOPE
Fixes Kate of Interest on
Loans and Provides .Man
ner of Selling Pledges
Special Dlsiwtch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2d.âThe Â«vllÂ«
that flow from the pawnbroking shops
; are again the subject of legislative ac
; tlon. If a bill proposed by Senator
Woodward this afternoon Is made a law
they will be at an end, however, at
least so far as San Francisco la oon-
I cerned. The bill introduced to-day oer
-1 mits of no greater charge of Interest
by pawnbrokers than one and ons-hsif
' per cent a month and. on yearly pledges
jno greater a sum than ten per cent
â¢ and then only after a license has been
; duly issued them. It is further previd
jed that their books must always be
open for inspection by the proper au
thorities and that they must sell no
pledges except after advertising the
same at least once a week for four con
! secutive weeks, the articles to be sold
being faithfully described.
"The purpose of this bill." said Sena
tor Woodward, "is to permit of the or
-1 ganization in San Francisco of an In
stitution of recognized standing along
! the lines of the provident loan and
workingmen's loan associations of New
York in which D. O. Mills and J. P.
1 Morgan took a great interest. The pur
poses of the institution maybe termed
philanthropic as they save the unfor
> tunate people that are forced to pawn
; their chattels from falling into the grip
lof the usurers that conduct the places.
' I am assured by prominent people of
j San Francisco that if my measure car
ries they will establish an institution
! with a capital of $200,000. the same to
Ibe under the supervision of the State
. Bank Commission and that they will
make loans on all classes of chattels at
net income of 6 per cent per annum."

NIPPED BY BLIZZARD
COLD SNAP KILLS ORANGES
AND DAMAGES THE TREES.
South Greatest
Sufferer by the
Storm.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.âWeather
Bureau experts were kept busy to-day
receiving reports of low temperatures
from all parts of the country east of
the Rockies. The South suffered the
most. The records of 1886 and 1891
were equaled, or nearly so. In Florida
the orange crop will be killed and the
trees severely damaged.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.. Jan. 26.â1t
is believed that the freeze last night
in Florida destroyed all citrus fruits
on trees excepting in the extreme
southern part of the State, the total
destruction being placed at 300.000
boxes, possibly more. Grave fears are
entertained that the trees in the Jack
sonville section are injured, if not
killed. It will be impossible to ar
rive at definite conclusions before
spring.
The fear as to orange trees, how
ever, is confined to the northern sec
tion of the Sta*e and it is not believed
that the larger part of the trees in
the orange belt proper, which is 200
â  miles south of Jacksonville, have been
seriously hurt. Tender vegetables have
been killed.
BLIZZARD IN THE KLONDIKE.
Miners and Prospectors Reported to
Be Suffering Great Hardships.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Jan. 26.âThe
worst blizzard ever known in the
â  Klondike region raged last Thursday,
Friday and Saturday. The news was
br6ught here by the steamer Dolphin
from Skagway. Not only was the
â¢weather bitterly cold, but the snowfall
is unprecedented. The gale swept the
Upper Yukon as far down as Dawson
ajid also took in the Tanana and Cop
per River valleys. All trails are im
passable and the snow was drifted in
many places to a depth of twenty feet.
Miners and prospectors are said to be
suffering untold hardships and ad
vices from the interior are to the ef
fect that there is fear that some will
. die of cold and starvation.
Ten days ago a party started from
Fairbanks to Valdez and another from
Fairbanks to Dawson. It is feared
that both of these have been lost. Re
lief parties have been sent out from
Dawson and every effort will be made
to locate the missing men. The winter
trail is not a long one and men who
have come over it since these parties
started out say that not a vestige of
life was seen by them.

Clear Weather
Gives Relief to
Gotham.
NEW YORK, Jan. 26.âNew York to
night is recovering from the effects of
yesterday's storm, which so effectually
put a stop to traffic and tied up some
lines of business. Althouh the day was
bitter cold, 15,000 men were sent out to
remove the snow from the leading thor
oughfares, and, aided by the men of the
surface car roads, many avenues of
travel are now open. Cars are running
on many of the principal lines, the rail
roads are sending out trains, ferry
boats are running on schedule time and
milk, coal and food supplies have begun
to reach the city.
More than 250 shovelers were treated
at the hospitals below Fourteenth street
for frost bites, and scores of others
were attended at uptown institutions
and by physicians. Owing to the diffi
culty in reaching downtown offices but
little business was transacted during
the day, and places of amusement were
scantily attended to-night.
Suburban railway traffic gradually
resumed normal conditions late in the
day, but through trains on most roads
w ere hours late. The embargo on ship
ping was lifted with the advent of clear
weather, and the large fleet of delayed
liners reached port Ice-covered. All re
port tempestuous voyages and much
suffering among their crews. The
steam lighter Clarence, which left
Bayonne, N. J., for Brooklyn yesterday
with seven men aboard has not been
heard from. A vessel is reported sunk
off Robbins Reef, and it is feared it
may be the Clarence.
The firemen of New York suffered se
verely from the effects of the storm.
They responded to twenty-nine alarms,
and by the order of the Commissioner
were denied their usual time off duty.
The cold weather, which has been
general along the Atlantic coast, ap
pears to be giving-way.
WILL PURCHASE
MATERIAL HERE
W. 31. Pinkston Says Canton-
Hankow Bail way Will Bo
Finished in Three Years
"William M. Pinkston, one of the offi
cials of the Canton-Hankow Railway
Company of China, is a guest at the
Grand. He arrived here, with his son,
on the last steamer from the Orient,
and Is on his way East to purchase
material for the construction of the
projected line between the two cities
named, of which twenty miles have al
ready been finished. About 750 miles
of road between Canton and Hankow
are to be built. The work will begin
in June and is expected to be completed
in three years. A great deal of the
material, Including the ties, Pinkston
expects to purchase on this coast.
It was recently reported from Brus
sels that J. Pierpont Morgan had pur
chased the King of Belgium's interest
In the Canton-Hankow road and that
it was contemplated to combine the
French, Belgian and American inter
ests so as eventually to cover the
Franco-Belgian concessions for a line
from Hankow to Peking, thereby mak
ing a trunk line of about 2500 miles
from Peking to Canton. The dispatch
added that much opposition was shown
by the Chinese Government to foreign
enterprises. Concerning these recent
reports Pinkston said last night:
There Is probably truth In the Drugsei* re
ports. The Canton-Hankow Railioad Is to bo
built under a concession grant:Â«d to the China-
American Company, of which J. Pierpont Mor
gan is the financier. When the bonds for the
road were issued Morgan placed a block of
them abroad and the report reached China
that the Belgians, who do all their foreign
Investing through the Government, j had pur
chased the securities. The Chinese,.'especially
the more intelligent classes, are strongly op
posed to any foreigners other than Americana
getting control of big Interests in their em
pire. They have great faith in American en
terprise and keenly appreciate the course of
this country after the Boxer war in preventing
the other foreign governments from taking
more of the Oriental territory.
When It was reported that Belgian capital
i had been invested in the bonds of the Canton-
I Kankow Railroad the Chinese officials showed
their displeasure and notified the China-Amer
ican Company that China would prefer to take
the bonds itself. As a result of this dip
lomatically put protest the vice president of
our company and J. Pierpont Morgan went to
Europe to recover the bonds placed on that
continent. The recently reported purchase of
the railroad bonds by Morgan from the King
of Belgium was probably the result of nego
tiations that had been pending for some time.
While grateful to the Americans and admiring
their commercial plucl and enterprise the
Chinese frequently fear that the former may
play some Yankee trie* on them and conse
quently their suspicions often Interfere' with
big business transactions
- Tlie Canton-Hankow tallroad Is a prom
ising undertaking. When completed It will
be the best line of road in all China. The
construction of the first twenty miles of the
road along the banks of the Canton or Pearl
River, as it la often cnled, met with con
siderable opposition, owtig to the fact that
its operations naturally 'nterfered with trans
portation of freight by water. This opposi
tion, together with small riots that resulted
from troubles among the Mongolian laborers
we employed, are now things of the past
and we expect to have no further trouble in
completing the road and making final con
nections with the line Ui Peking.
Burglars Get Small Returns.
The saloon of Malerbi & Marsi at
419 Davis street was entered by burg
lars early yesterday morning* by re
moving a screen and breaking a win
dow. The cash register was forced
open and 30 cents, all that it con
tained, stolen. The fruit store of A.

Failure of Bank
Due to Delay
of Train.
CHICAGO, Jan. 26.âThe Pan-Ameri
can Banking Company, 186 Dearborn
street, an institution little known In
the financial world, closed its doors to
customers to-day, but announcement
waÃ made that payments might be re
sumed to-morrow. The bank is said to
have done a considerable business in
small accounts.
The stalling of the Twentieth Century
Limited train on the New York Central
is alleged to have caused the suspen
sion of the bank. W. H. Hunt, the
president, is a passenger on the block
aded train which should have reached
Chicago to-day. Julius N. Heldman,
the bank's attorney, declared that
when Hunt reached Chicago business
would be resumed.
Declaring that the bank had a debt
of $10,0U0 with no assets, a shareholder
in the concern filed a petition in the
Circuit Court early in the day for the
appointment of a receiver. According
to the petition the bank was organized
in January of last year under the laws
of West Virginia with a capital stock
of $500,000.
Edwaid C. Day was appointed receiv
er, his bonds being fixed at $20,000. Dur
ing the court proceeding stockhold
ers brought attachment proceedings
against the concern and constables lev
ied on everything in sight.
NEW \ultK, Jan. 2o. âAmong the
trains stalled on the New York Central
is the Twentieth Century Limited, due
in Chicago this morning. The train is
stuck in drifts near Irvlngton, with
about fifty man and women on board,
who will not be able to communicate
with the outer world until sÂ©o workmen
sent from New York can clear the
tracks.
The passengers of the limited, how
ever, will fare much better than those
on some other snowbound trains. They
have plenty of light and heat and there
is a well-stocked dining car attached.
For several hours after the train left
New York the dispatchers completely
lost track of it. A member of the crew
succeeded in reaching a telephone late
at night and sent a message to Tarry
town, telling of the dilemma. Snow was
drifting in about the train every min
ute, he said. -v
An effort was made by a party of
men from Irvington to get food to the
men and women on Ahe Albany Express
and the Croton IoSKI, but they could
not fight their way through the drifts.
They will remain warm so long as the
coal holds out and the engine can force
steam through the heating pipes, but
they can get nothing to eat. /

PLAN TO DRAIN
GREAT VALLEYS
Bills for River Improvement
of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Are Ready
OUTLINE OF THE WORK
0
Legislature Will Be Asked
to Make an Initial
Appropriation of $500,000
Measures relating to the control of
Hood waters In the Sacramento and
San Joaquin rivers and the reclama
tion of lands now wholly or in part
submerged will be introduced in the
Legislature to-day. In the Senate the
bills will be presented by Senator Rush
of Solano and in the Assembly by As
semblyman Moore of San Joaquin.
There are live bills and one proposed
amendment to the constitution of the
State, but all have a direct bearing
on the main proposition for the
reclamation of lands by the control of
flood waters. It is proposed that the
burden of expense shall be borne joint
ly, if not equally, by the Government
of the United States, the State of Cal
ifornia and the land owners who may
be benefited by the establishment of
an effective system of drainage. The
plan recommended is that which was
reported by the executive committee
of the- J River Improvement and Drain
nge Association and adopted by the
general body.

of the committee cover the getting in touch
with Cnlted States authorities at Washington,
as vÂ»Â«ll as the all important matter of ap

WORK APPROVED.
Californians who are familiar with j
State legislation and Federal Govern- |
mental action in regard to the allow- j
ance of money to carry out the plans !
of engineers for impounding mining
debris will observe that the bill to be j

"Private property must not be taken
or damaged for public use without Just
compensation .having been first made
to or paid into court for the owner."

The bill provides for an initial ap

everything depends upon an allowance
by the Federal Government to assist in
the execution of the improvement.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
WANTS GUARDIAN FOR
HER OLD HUSBAND.
Mrs. Boardman Fears His Brain Is Feeble
OAKLAND, Jan. 26.â-In the belief
that Joseph Boardman, octogenarian
millionaire, layabout to give away al
most his entire estate, his young and
pretty wife, to whom he was married In
1899, has filed a petition. to have a
guardian appointed of his person and
estate. She married him when he was
nearly 80 years of age, and she was
only 17. One child is the result of the
union.
Short of stature, with snowy white
beard, Boardman has been a familiar
figure on the streets of the city for
many years. Recently he has been per
fecting plans to convey to the Young
Men's Association and to the society of
Pioneers of California large bequests
and was also talking of giving an
aquarium to the city of Oakland. Fear
ing that the working out of his ideas
might result in consuming the larger
portion of his estate, which it is be
lieved will amount to over $1,000,000,
the wife has stepped In to protect her
self and child.
â¢ In her petition, filed by Attorneys M.
'C. Chapman and Fitzgerald and Ab
bott to-day, Mrs. Boardman sets forth
that she is his wife and that he has a
large estate of real and personal prop
erty and then states as follows:
That said Joseph Boardman. Is now and for
' a long time Immediately last past has been
extremely weak, both of hody and mind, and
is upward of the age of "*.â¦ years, and by rea
son of such old agÂ» and infirmity of both body
and mind is mentally Incompetent to manage
his property and is unable, unassisted, to
properly manage and take care of himself or
to properly manage or take care of hts prop
erty,' and by reason thereof would be" likely to
be 'deceived or imposed Upon by. artful or de
signing persons, and said Joseph Boardman
has no guardian appointed by law.
Boardman himself, accompanied by a
young man, went to the County Clerk's
office at noon to-day for a copy of the
petition filed by his wife, and with
trembling voice and palsied gesticula
tion said to a Call reporter:
This â is all because I want to give some
money to' the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion. My wife and' my mother-in-law want
to get hold of my property, of the, gold coin
and 'the cash. I have managed my affairs
for forty years and can manage them still.
Xo. J don't want to say how much I was go
ing to give away, but J will have attorneys to
represent me when the time comes. I was
over at my lawyer's' office yesterday and
found my wife just outside the door when I
came out, and I suppose she had been listen
ing at the keyhole.
Boardman and his young wife were
married on June 20, 1899. The license
was secured by Mrs. Eugenia E. Walk
er, mother vof the bride. Boardman's
age was given as 59 years, although the
great register of that year shows that
.he was 75 years of age at that time.
Miss "Walker was 17. After their mar
riage they went on a trip to Europe,
and about a year and a half ago the
family was enlarged by the arrival of
a son and heir.
Jn regard to the reason for bringing
the action Attorney R. M. Fitzgerald
saidi
â¢It has- come to a point where we feel that
Mr . Boardman needs a guardian. We have
"been - Informed that he is talking of deeding
away his entire estate. I understand that he
wants to give a large sum of money to the
Y. M. C. A., also a large bequest to the Plo
â¢ neers of California. He is also talking of
giving an aquarium to the city of Oakland,
and I know not what else. We hear that it is
his plan to give away his entire estate and for
this reason we believed the estat" should be
protected and have asked for the appointment
of a. guardian.
EXPERT ON INSANITY
SAYS CAMPBELL WAS SANE
Evidence in Murder Trial Ends With
a Hypothetical Question Put to
Dr. J. W. Robertson.
OAKLAND, Jan. 26.âThe taking of
e'vldence in the Campbell murder trial
was finished this afternoon and noth
ing now remains but the arguments in
the case. These will be made next
Monday and the case will then go to
the jury. It has consumed a full
week. Much evidence has been intro
duced in behalf of the prisoner to
show that he was greatly worried by
the actions of his wife, whom he
finally killed.
To-tiay's testimony consisted of a
single hypothetical question propound
ed -by District Attorney Allen to Dr.
J." W. Robertson of Livermore, ad
mitted as a specialist on insanity. The
question recited nearly all the material
facts in the chain of circumstances
and ended with asking if in his opin
ion Campbell was insane or not at the
time he committed the murder. He
answered that he believed he was
sane.

MOTHER TAKES
ELOPING WIFE
Bride Who Runs Away With
Motorman From Capital
Returns With Parent
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Jan. 26.
A devoted mother intervened to-day
to take from her male companion
young and wayward Lillie Patton. the
child-wife bf John Patton of Sacra
mento. Her elopement with Walter
Boone, a capital city motorman. w r as
blocked last night by the arrest of the
runaways at Sixteenth-street station.
When mamma in the person of Mrs.
Sarah James of Broderick, Yolo County,
appeared at the city prison to claim
the youthful bride, there were tears
and prdtestations, but the recreant
wife at last consented to go home, but
she insisted that the separation from
her companion in flight would be only
temporary.
The police permitted Mrs. James to
take charge of her daughter, and they
released Boone, as he was not accused
of any crime.
Mrs. Patton, despite the fact she has
been a wife for only seven months, is
heartily weary of her marriage to Pat
ton. This was the second time she had
left her husband in that brief period.
And the determined girl declares she
will never return to her Sacramento
husband, but will bide her time and
wed Boone, whom, she avows, she
loves with an abiding trust.
Recounting her tale of domestic
woes, Mrs. Patton said:
I shall not be 17 years old until April. Dur
ing our married life, short as it has been, my
husband has not treated me as I believe a
wife should be treated. Several times he
locked me in the. house, and once when I
wanted to go to my mother when she was ill
I was prevented from leaving. Once before
I ran awfty to my mother, but she persuaded
me to return to my husband. When I left
with Mr Boone I intended to go to relatives
in San Francisco and stay with them until I
could get a divorce and marry him.
POLITICAL POT
BUBBLES OVER
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
( 2148 Center Street, Jan. 26.
Arguments that at times became
heated, mingled with personalities of
an interesting character, marked the
session of the Republican City Central
Committee, held last night. Chairman
Thomas* plan to have the coming city
convention delegates nominated by the
precinct clubs of the town was strenu
ously opposed, and eventually overruled
by the committee.
E. C. Marliave, a prominent member
of the committee, in discussing Thomas'
proposal, declared his belief that the
chairman sought too much power in
Berkeley politics, which he supposed
would accrue to him if the plan to
nominate officers by precinct clubs
should be adopted. The clubs, he said,
supposedly, would be under the chair
man's control, and the delegates thus
practically of his own nominating, in
very many instances.
Mr. Marliave advocated the adoption
of a plan which should, include the
nominating of delegates by the City
Central Committee, and after a lengthy
and torrid discussion the suggestion of
Mr. Marliave was adopted. Chairman
Thomas alone voted in the negative.
The committee settled the question of
what basis should be used, in appor
tioning delegates to the wards, by com
promising between the vote cast for
Congressman J. R. Knowland and that
cast for Judge Lord two years ago.

YOUNG WIFE OF OCTOGENARIAN
CAPITALIST WHO WANTO TO
BE APPOINTED HIB GUARDIAN.
BENZINE USED
BY INCENDIARY
Daring Attempt to Destroy
by Fire Large Business
Block in South Berkeley
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Jan. 26.
A daring attempt to destroy by fire
the Carlson building in South Berkeley
was made by an incendiary last night,
the attempt failing because the swift
flame engendered by benzine attracted
the attention of Dr. A. W. Hitt, who
gave the alarm and subdued the fire.
Dr. Hitt was standing at his office
window, about midnight, when he saw
a man run swiftly from the shadow of
the Carlson building, across the street
from his own office at Harmon and
Adeline streets. Almost instantly af
ter, a sheet of flame swept up the wall
of the Carlson block.
Stepping to the telephone, Dr. Hitt
called for the Fire Department and
town marshal, and then rushed across
the street, joined as he ran by several
residents of the neighborhood who had
noted the blaze. These all worked
heroically to quell the names, and suc
ceeded in putting them out before the
Fire Department arrived. The charred
walls of the building testify to the
fierceness of the flames fought by the
little bahd of amateur firemen.
Investigation made to-day by Deputy
Marshal Pickett, acting for Marshal
Kerns, revealed a benzine bottle, par
tially unwrapped, lying close by the
wall. It was evident to the officials
that the benzine had been used to fire
the building. The wrapping paper on
the bottle bore the name of an Oakland
firm, and the officers attempted to get
a clew from this circumstance that
might aid in the finding of the in
cendiary.
This is the third of a series of at
tempts at incendiary fires in this part
of Berkeley during the last six months,
each being a mystery which the police
Have not been able to solve.

the means of entertainment which It now has.
At that time some students in the university
were making their way by reporting for the
San Francisco papers. Among these young
men, who made their headquarters at my
store, was our Assemblyman, William Waste.
In the fall of that year there was a sensation
when it was found out that a number of
bchoolboys were frequenting a certain billiard
parlor and there gambling and drinking. I
talked to Mr. Waste about It and we decided
that I had better write a letter to the Berke
ley Advocate, explaining that the boys had
no place to meet except the billiard parlor
or the street and that we thought it advisable
to fit up some room with books and games
where the boys could have the proper lftfro
en,ces about them from home.
After a few preliminary- meetings a mass
meeting was held in Shattuck Hall. About
forty people attended. Daniel Bishop was
elected temporary chairman. A permanent or
ganization was founded with Mr. Waste as
president, Mr. Langston secretary and I treas
urer. We rented the store now occupied by
Drlggs & Butterfleld and had it fitted up.
We all helped In getting the rooms ready to
open, some by gifts of money, others by gifts
of books and magazines, others by labor.
Miss Lucy Wheeler was the first librarian.
Mr. Layman offered to give a set of Holmes'
works if we would call it "The Holmes Library
Association," wbich we dkl.
Little did I think when a few young men
began talking of a library that it would
grow to such proportions and In less than
thirteen years be housed In such a magnificent
building as this.
The programme of the exercises fol
lows:
Overture, "Hungarian Lusteplel," orchestra:
address, "The Beginning," Dr. J. Edson Kel
sey; solo, Miss Ethel Jones; address, "The

The library building was made possi
ble by the gift of Andrew
who contributed $40,000, and by the
gift of land from Mrs. Rosa Shattuck.
The structure is built of sandstone and
brick, two stories in height, with a red
tile roof. The basement contains a
juvenile room modeled after that in the
famous Carnegie Library at Pittsburg.
This room will hold 10,000 volumes. In
the same part of the library are a
binder, dumb-waiter, bicycle room, Jan
itor's room, furnace room, storeroom
and lavatories.
On the main floor is the periodical
and reading room, finished in golden
oak, as is the entrance. The reference
room, stack room and study room are
on this floor, the stack room having a
capacity for 40,000 volumes. Altogether
the building can contain 60,000 books.
The library's equipment was added to
this evenipg by gifts of books brought
by guests, each of whom had been
asked to contribute a volume upon en
tering the building.

VENERABLE DIPLOMAT
FROM GREAT BRITAIN
DIES IN ALAMEDA
SIR FRANCIS J. PAKENHAM. K.
C. M. G., WHO DIED SUDDENLY
IN ALAMEDA YESTERDAY.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 26.âSir Francis
Pakenham, a distinguished member of
England's diplomatic corps, and a
nephew of the famous General Edwin
Pakenham, who fell while leading his
troops against .the citizen soldiery of
General Andrew Jackspn in the mem
orable battle of New Orleans, fought
January 8, 1815, died this morning at 8
o'clock at the residence of his brother
in-law, Francis M. Ward of 1177 Regent
street. Death was due to bronchial
pneumonia.
Sir Francis Pakeriham, with Lady
Pakenham and her maid, arrived in
San Francisco last Thursday night on
the steamer Manchuria from the Ori
.ent. On Saturday the party came to
this city and were the guests of the
family of Francis M. Ward, who is a
brothlr of Lady Pakenham.: Two days
ago the titled diplomat complained of
a cold from which he had suffered on
the voyage across the Pacific. Dr. G.
P. Reynolds was called to attend him.
Early this morning Sir Francis' condi
tion took an alarming turn and at 8
o'clock he passed away while his wife
and the members of the Ward family
stood about the deathbed.
Sir Francis sprang from an ancient
and honored family that gave Britain
many gallant army and navy officers.
He was the fourth son of the second
Earl of Longford and was born in Sus
sex, England, 72 years ago. The great
er part of his life was spent in the dip

in twenty-two different capitals. His
last official position, from which he re
tired two years ago, was that of Min
ister to Sweden. He was secretary of
the British Legation at Copenhagen,
Denmark, In 1864 and Minister-resident
and Consul General to Chile from 1878
to 1885. In 1879 Sir Francis married the
present Lady Pakenham, who was a
daughter of the Rev. Henry Ward of
England, father of Francis M. Ward of
this city. There is no issue of the mar
riage.
Sir Francis and Lady Pakenham left
Southampton on the 15th of last No
vember and traveled to Hongkong
by way of the Mediterranean Sea and
the Suez Canal. The voyage was
planned for recreation and for the
benefit of the distinguished English
man's health. The party intended to
leave San Francisco on the liner So

WATER SUPPLY
OF BAY CITIES
Marsden Manson 'Talks to
Starr King Fraternity on
Investigations in State
R ITERS ARE IMPURE
Claims That Tuolumne River
Offers Best Outlook for
San Francisco and Oakland
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 26.
"The Future Water Supply of the
Municipalities of San Francisco Bay"
was discussed this evening by Marsden
Manson, Ph.D., a well-known civil en
gineer of San Francisco, at a meeting
of the Starr King Fraternity of this
city. Mr. Manson was formerly a mem
ber of the Board of Public Works of
San Francisco, and during his service
on the board was a member of the
water commission which, after the
adoption of the new charter of San
Francisco, was appointed to investi
gate the available sources of water
supply, for the purpose of selecting
that best suited not only to the future
needs of San Francisco, but one that
would furnish an adequate supply for
the cities about the bay.
After briefly relating the history of
the development of San Francisco's
present water supply and telling of
the systems of the other bay cities, Mr.
Manson said:
After the adoption of the new charter in
San Francisco the commission of which I was
a member began a study of the various
sources of water supply which might be util
ized by the municipalities on the shores of
the bay. Briefly, these sources of supply are:
Lake Tahoe, the Yuba' River, the Feather
River, Eel River, the creeks of San Fran
cisco Peninsula, the Bay Shore artesian well
supply, the Sacramento and San Joaquin riv
ers, the Stanislaus River and the Tuolumne
River.
Of these Lake Tahoe presents engineering
and legal difficulties not to be easily over
come: the Yuba, Feather, Bel, Sacramento.
San Joaquin and Stanislaus rivers are ex
posed to the drainage from cities and towns
along- their bank and the rights to the water
must necessarily be purchased at a great cost,
and the peninsula creeks are impure. The
Bay Shore artesian well supply Is doubtful at
the best and could not be depended upon to
meet the ever increa/iing consumption of
water.
We also investigated the supply of the Bay
Cities Water Company, but this was also re
jected because of a serious doubt as to the
quantity of water available and the question
of the right of the company to divert the
water as claimed.
This eliminated all except the Tuolumne
River, and here I believe that we have a
water supply sufficient for all the cities about
the bay for all time. The Tuolumne River
drains an area. of 1500 square miles, and a
partial development of this watershed will
store enough water to furnish a supply of
45,000,000, Ã¼bo gallons. And the entire area
above the site of the proposed reservoirs Is
composed of mountains. In which neither hu
man beings nor cattle can possibly exist, thus
insuring water absolutely free from contam
ination.
BOY DISTURBS
SPIRIT VOICES
Oakland -Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 26.
Because his presence grated upon the
refined and spiritualistic sensibilities of
Mrs. Alexander Gordon, her foster son,
George Gordon, 13 years old, was turn
ed out into the streets to find shelter
as best he could from the winter's
storm. Such is the statement of the
case as made to-day by Ezra Decoto,
the probation officer, who took charge
of the boy after he was picked up in
the rain of Tuesday night.
Mrs. Gordon is a devotee Of the oc
cult. She practices the art of calling
forth voices from beyond the grave. In
the prosecution of her mystic calling
Mrs. Gordon, according to De
coto and her foster son, ex
perienced a detrimental jarring
and jangling of affinities when the
youngster was around the house. So
Master Alexander was compelled to
hunt quarters more congenial. The po
lice learned to-day that for three
nights the youthful outcast was com
pelled to sleep in an undesirable place
at the rear of the Globe Hotel, Thir
teenth street and Broadway, where the
Gordons, husband and wife, had rooms.
Captain of Police W. J. Petersen de
clared that in his judgment the boy
had been treated outrageously. To the
end that proper care be given the
youth arrangements were made to-day
for Mrs. M. Stubblefield, a farm owner
in South Dakota, to take charge of the
boy. Mrs. Stubblefield became inter
ested and after a talk wtth young Gor
don consented to accept him as her
ward.
The foster father insists that the boy
became incorrigible and could not be
handled by ordinary parental methods.
TWO MEN BECOME INSANE
AS RESULT OF A QUARREL
Derangement of One Is Due to Injuries
Received, and the Other Is
Brooding Over His Act.
TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 26.âTwo
men in Yakima County have gone in
sane as the result of a slight quarrel,
which occurred in December. Henry
Little, a rancher, living at Sunnyside
was arrested to-day for bis part in the
quarrel. It is alleged that he as

with a pitchfork. A few days later
Little became delirious from brooding
over his act, developed a mild form of
Insanity and was sent to an asylum
He was released early this week
Landerheder also became* insane this
week and has been taken to North
Yakima for examination and commit
tal
Witness Is Hanged in Effigy.
REDDING, Jan. 26.âChris Thar

Tuesday evening in Happy Valley on
account of testimony that he gave fa
vorable to the company in the recent

Keswick. The trial resulted in the
farmers getting nothing.

Any Man Over Fifty.
You can interest any man over fifty
years of age in anything that will
ihake him feel better, because while he
may not as yet have any positive or
ganic disease he no longer feels the
buoyancy and vigor of twenty-five nor
the freedom from aches and pains he
enjoyed in earlier years, and he very
naturally examines with interest any
proposition looking to the improvement
and preservation of his health.
He will notice among other things
that the stomach of fifty is a very dif

sessed at twenty-five. That greatest

eaten and how much of it, and even

A proposition to perfect or improve
the digestion and assimilation of food
is one which interests not only every
man of fifty, but every man, woman
and child of any age, because the

.which will promptly and thoroughly di
gest wholesome food, because blood,
nerves, brain tissue and every other
i onstitutent of the body are entirely
the product of digestion, and no medi
cine or "health" food can possibly cre
ate pure blood or restore shaky nerves
when a weak stomach is replenishing
the daily wear and tear of the body
from a mass of fermenting half-digest
ed food.
. No, the stomach itself wants help
and.in no round-about way, either; it
wants direct, unmistakable assistance,
such as is given by one or two Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal.
These tablets cure stomach trouble,
because their use gives the stomach a
chance to rest and recuperate; one of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contains di
gestive elements sufficient to digest
."000 'grains of ordinary food, such as
bread, meat, eggs, etc.
The plan of dieting is simply another
name for. starvation, and the use of
prepared foods and new-fangled break
fast foods simply makes matters
v.orse. as any dyspeptic who has tried
them knows.
As Dr. Bennett says, the only reason
i can imaTglne why Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are not universally used by
everybody who is troubled in any way
with' poor digestion is because many
people seem to think that because a
medicine is advertised or is sold in drug
stow* or is protected by a trade mark
n'lust be a humbug, whereas as a mat
.ter-of truth any druggist who is ob
s#rvaht knows that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets have cured more people of in
digestion, heart burn, heart trouble,
nervous prostration and run-down con
dition generally than all the patent
niediefnes and doctors' prescriptions
for stomach trouble combined.

the peace by fighting when they were
arrested In Hinckley place. As for
the cause of the contention, it cut no
figure in the case. Perhaps if Senor
Escrodlto were in court he might be
requested to suspend lady-killing and
devote his attention to the taunting
of bulls so long as he remains in this
country, but even that might be so
much counsel wasted, as, according
to the testimony of Senorita Potalis,
the picador seemed to be the pur
sued rather than the pursuer of a
weaker s&x, and certainly it would be
unreasonable to ask him to abandon
the manly graces that make him so
irresistiblly charming to said se:c.
However, the case would be taken un
der advisement until January 31, by
which time, it was hoped, the ladies
themselves might have found a way
out of their mutual fascination. The
court would go even farther and ex
press hope that Senor Escrodito's pro
fessional duties might necessitate his
early departure from this city, where
bull-skating did not seem to have at
tained much popularity as a Bpectacle,
anyhow.

IS SUSPENDED

Filed Against Mrs. Ward
CHARGES OF DAUGHTERS
â  â¦
Say Father's Colored House
keeper Has' Conspired to
Loot Estate With Claims
Judge Troutt yesterday suspended
Hattie Ward, the colored woman, from
her position as executrix of the estate
of the late J. B. Reinhardt, pending an
investigation into the charges made by
Charlotte Brand and Flora L. Morton,
daughters of the deceased, in a petition
for the executrix's removal. Otto
Lemcke, co-executor, is now in charge
of the estate and the tight promises
to be a bitter one.
Hattie Ward was Reinhardt's servant
and housekeeper for twenty-three
years. It is charged that after his
death she and her son-in-law, Benja
min J. Gcldman, a liquor dealer, stole
a certain tin box and appropriated a
$500 note to their own use. Then, it Is
alleged, they entered upon a conspiracy
to loot and blackmail the estate by
false suits and the presentation of
false claims.
The Ward woman, it is declared,
pretended to claim $20,000 for services
as agent for twenty-three years and al
leged that Reinhardt had contracted to
leave her that amount in his will,
whereas he only left her $4000. So she
made a claim for $16,000, it is said, and
another for $27 600 for services as
housekeeper and assigned both to Ben.
jamin J. Goldman & Co. These claims
were presented to her as executor and
she allowed them, but they were re
jected by Lemcke. The woman is also
charged with having fraudulently ob
tained a check for $2000, with using the
property of the estate, and with being
ignorant, illiterate and wanting in in
tegrity and moral principle. On these
grounds her removal is demanded and
the hearing has been set for Febru
ary 2.
Lemcke says that it will be proven
that Mrs. Ward was paid for all of
her services to Reinhardt..

Mrs. Miller had decided to abstain from
prosecuting.
"Isn't that so, madam?" he smiling
ly asked the lady, who sat in the wit
ness chair and listlessly surveyed her
bandaged band. "You don't want to
testify against your husband, do you?"
"What's thatâdon't want to testify?"
she exclaimed, and the acerbity of her
tone made the lawyer jump backward.
"Well, I guess I do want to testify
against him. What do you think I'm
here forâmy health?"
And testify against him she did with
such relentless vigor that the Judge
held him to answer in the Superior
Court the charge of assault to murder.
Mr. Miller pleaded that he had been
provoked to the knife play by his bet

the paucity of her personal charms did

taker. Judge Mogan continued the
hearing until next Tuesday, when, it is
understood, the defensive plea will be
submitted that Wong Hing was guilt
less of intent to defraud, but stood
upon what he believed to be his right
to enter the playhouse. On the even
ing of January 23, it may be explained,
he paid his way into, the theater, and
at the end of the first act went out to
refresh himself by smoking one pill of
opium, intending to return in time to
witness act 2. Thus he became pos
sessed of the ticket which was repudi
ated on the 25th. He inadvertently in
haled more of the poppy fumes than his
senses could withstand, and when he
regained consciousness two days and
nights had passed without his knowl
edge of their passage. So he went back
to the theater, hoping he would not
miss the great battle scene of the sec
ond act which had been played two
nights before, and declined to take the
doorkeeper's word that his return check
was a back number until he looked at
the date printed on it, and then he con
tended that he was entitled to admit
tance, anyway, inasmuch as the ticket
had not been used by any other person
than himself on the day of its issuance.

BLEMER SLAYS
ARMY OF SHEEP
Dr. C. H. Blemer, editor of the Live
Stock and Dairy Journal, formerly a
live stock quarantine inspector in the
service of the United States Govern
ment, made his deposition yesterday
morning before United States Commis
sioner Heacock in an interesting litiga
tion now before the United States
Court of Claims at Washington, D. C.
Avery T. Crary and Allen Packer, citi
zens of lowa, and Albert A. Knott, v
citizen of Colorado, claim from the
United States $9193 damages.
The complaint before the Court of
Claims recites that on December 26,
1896, they purchased through their
agent, J. B. Manby of Trinidad, Colo.,
5238 sheep from Don Carlos Zuolago of
Chihuahua, Mexico, for the purpose of
shipment to the United States. Don
Carlos gave them a certificate reciting
that the sheep were grown on his ranch
at Bustillos, that they were in good
health and that there had not been any
disease in the flock. The complaint re
cited further that on the morning of
December 27, 1896, the American in
spectors at El Paso were notified that
the sheep were in transit and would ar
rive at Ciudad Juarez on that after
noon, and that, disregarding that no
tice and wholly neglecting their duty,
the inspectors were not present in
Juarez when the sheep arrived. It is
alleged that the sheep, by direction of
J. W. Magoffin, special deputy collector
of the United States, were taken across
the Rio Grande into El Paso. It is fur
ther alleged that "the admission of the
sheep at Juarez without inspection by
Inspectors of the Bureau of Animal In
dustry was in accordance with the
practice which had heretofore prevailed
at this port regarding all stock import
ed from Mexico, and which custom waa
well known to said inspectors."
It is also recited that on December 28,
by direction of Alexander Lobb, a
United States inspector, the sheep were
examined by Francisco J. Herrera, vet
erinary inspector at Ciudad Juarez, and
that he gave a certificate of good
health, after which Inspector Lobb told
complainants that the sheep would be
allowed to proceed to their destination
in the United States. The sum demand
ed as damages includes $836 customs
duties paid to Magoffin: $7857, the value
of the sheep at $1 50 per head, and
$500 expended for their food while in
quarantine.
Dr. Blemer testified that he had re
ceived information that the sheep had
been infected with scab before their im
portation. After examining them he re
ported to the authorities at Washing
ton that 50 per cent of the sheep were
Infected with scab, that all had been
exposed to infection and that it would
not be safe to segregate them. He met
Manby in Kansas City on January 9.
1897, and asked if he had any contract
with regard to rejecting diseased sheep,
and Manby replied that he had a right
to reject all diseased sheep. Then Dr.
Blemer asked if he had rejected any,
and he replied that he had not. that he
knew that most of them had scab, but
in a very mild form, and that it could
be cured easily.
"I considered it a serious case," con
tinued Dr. Blemer. "Knott admitted
that the sheep had the scab, but that
it was of a light, dry variety."
The witness added that on Decem
ber 25, 1896, he directed Inspectors Alex
ander Lobb and George Moser at El
Paso to examine all the sheep on the
Mexican side before they were allowed
to cross into the United States. The in
spectors did not report to him that they
had done so. The witness received or
ders from Washiri'ton to kill all the
sheep, and he did so.

CONTROL OF SANTO DOMINGO.
OF all the disorderly and disorganized Spanish American gov
ernments, that of Santo Domingo has been the worst, and the, :
most constantly in revolutionary effervescence. Every form
of bad faith possible in regard to personal and property rights of
foreigners has been copiously illustrated by Santo Domingo. That |
country and its neighbor and congener, Haiti, have long been the
â¢plague' spots of the West Indies. Naturally very fertile, rich and
productive tropical regions, they have known no peace or order in
government, no progress in industrial development, no mental or
mora] progress and no sense of international responsibility. Pro- ;
tected by the Monroe doctrine in the integrity of their territory and |
sovereignty, these unruly countries have long abandoned themselves
to an orgy they call government, but which would be rejected by j
any ordinary American mob.
As business is not among their capacities and thrift is dan- j
gerous because it attracts public spoliation, tiiey have practiced in
viting foreigners in, to make the investments and maintain the ac
tivities necessary to community of life. Whenever these foreign in
vestments and enterprises become of profitable consequence they ex
cite the greed of the Government, and if the crowd that happen to
be'in power resist the temptation to rob the foreigner it avails him |
nothing, for a crowd that has no scruples organizes a revolution,
captures the Government and proceeds to steal everything in sight.
Then it invites more investments and when they are made, if it ;
through fear or satiety refrain from taking them in, another revo
lution brings in another swarm of cormorants and the foreigners
suffer.
With the Monroe doctrine out of the way the whole island would
long ago have been adequately punished by the United States or
sorhe other power. But protected by that both Haiti and Santo Do
mingo Have gone to an insufferable extreme, which civilization will
endure no longer. Their example of reckless dishonesty is imitated
by. Venezuela and other states in the revolutionary belt, and for
their sake and for the peace of the hemisphere something has to be
done. The main impediment has been furnished by American senti
mentalists, whose ignorance of the subject is only equaled by their
willingness to dictate terms for settlement of the difficulty. They
have one idea and that is that these are "sister republics," poor,
abused and struggling, that we should defend in everything they do.
When they rob a foreigner of his property, these sentimental people
express the opinion that the victim should seek redress in the courts
Of the Government that has despoiled him, and then they settle
back and preen as though they had discovered a great principle and
were more profound in the law of nations than Grotius or Puffendorf.
The fact is that the judicial establishments of those countries
partake of the lawlessness of the executive departments. There are
no courts in the sense in which we have courts. In many cases the
judges, so called, of these courts can neither read nor write. There
is no jurisprudence, no judicial system, no judicial refuge for the
'rights of person and property. They are as lacking in these re
spects as were the Comanche and Apache Indians, and our American I
sentimentalists deserve the lesson they would get in submitting any
rights they might have in peril to such a system of courts.
At last the United States has sought to end the debauch as far as
Santo Domingo is concerned. It is proposed that we administer the
customs of that country. Under this arrangement we would give
the barefooted government enough to run on and would apportion
the rest to the foreign creditors who have been robbed of their prop
erty. This would remove the temptation to revolution and secure
some stability of government. If we should keep up this financial
control long enough some of those disorderly people may get in the
habit of behaving themselves and the government may be favorably
and permanently affected.
The adoption of this policy would be notice served on the other
Latin-American states. What we should do in Santo Domingo we
will have to do soon in Venezuela, Guatemala and other robber
states, which have no idea of internal order and international re
sponsibility. We don't want their territory, and have no desire to
invade their sovereignty, but we will have order and honor among
them if we have to give them a whipping to do it.
A MONTH ago the Czar was troubled about the neutrality of
China. Now it is the neutrality of. Russia that troubles him.
It is the first time that the usually stupid masses have thrown
their vast weight to revolution. The incidents of the affair differ
from any other initial incidents of a revolution. The people, un
armed and in pacific disposition, sought meeting and audience with
the Czar. They had destroyed no property and had made no armed
attack on any one. There had been no bludgeoning nor first fight.
With childlike confidence in "the little father," they sought con
ference with him and believed he would meet them.
By orders of the savage Vladimir, the people, trudging on this
pacific errand, were mowed down like grass by the soldiers. When
the poor creatures held up their empty hands and called on their
"little brothers" not to shoot, the answer was a murderous volley.
No people under such circumstances has ever before met such a re
ception. There is probably not another ruler in Europe who, so sit
uated, would have refused to meet at least a delegation of the masses
and give them a hearing. It could happen only in Russia. . The
Czar, fleeing from one fortified palace to another, seems to have
thought only of his personal safety, and gave the Grand Dukes a
free rein to do as they pleased.
Mr. Andrew D. White, whose long diplomatic residence in St.
Petersburg makes him a good authority, says that the Czar, a weak
man, surrounded by Grand Dukes and women who tell him only
what they want him to believe and keep the truth from him, is ex
pected to do the thinking for all Russia. Unhappy must the nation
be under such guidance. If the revolutionary furor continue and is
met by more slaughter, Russia will soon sicken at the sight of her
own blood. ,
In the midst of all these significant events the world is struck
by the good sense shown by the Japanese diplomats. They abstain
strictly from any comment on a situation that is of such vast impor
tance to their country.
A NOVEL agitation has been begun in several Eastern cities
where public spirit is at healthy pressure, which advocates
the institution of model water fronts in such cities as have
extensive dockage areas and any great length of shipping districts.
Tn Detroit a public meeting was recently held at which the advocates
of civic beauty set in motion a movement looking to the gradual re
modeling of the city's water front upon a uniform scheme and the
suppression or screening of all unsightly adjuncts to that part of the
business district. In New York a similar agitation has resulted in
the appointment of a commission, which has the work of reordering
the water front under way.
Though, of course, the esthetic cannot intrude altogether upon
the very material aspects of trade and its marts, there is much that is
to be commended in the aspects of this movement. The water front
of a great seaport need not necessarily be the back door of the city
a place for offensive odors and grotesque sights, It is not so with
Antwerp and Hamburg; Liverpool from the Mersey has a certain
attraction about it. Yet in so many of our American cities on the
sea or the great central river the docks are places to be driven
through in a closed carriage with lavender salts held to the nose.
San Francisco is no exception. Though we could hardly hope to
make a rose garden of East street or to convert Spear-street wharf
into, a field of the cloth of gold, yet is there ample opportunity for
the exercise of a little of this new civic spirit here in our own city, i

> â  DO not like It," declared Miss
I Converse positively.
I "I thought It was great," pro- !
tested Darrow. "Now. that scene
where the girl makes the man propose
is awfully clever."
"No nice girl," said Miss Converse
oracularly, "would ever lead a man to i
propose."
"This is your third season, isn't it?"
asked Darrow.
"It is not polite to remind me that I
am growing to be a wall flower," chid- j
ed the girl.
"You are not," declared Darrow
promptly. "If I wanted to be slangy I
could say that you were a daisy."
"There are times," Baid Miss Con- ;
verse, "when even slang is excusable." ,
"Then consider it said," he answered
with a bow. "But to get on. You've
been out three seasons, and you say a
woman never leads a man to propose."
"I said no nice woman," corrected
Miss Converse.
"How about Barton and Nellie Rice?"
he urged.
"She didn't," defended Miss Converse.
"She told me all about it. He said he
wished he had a wife to make him as
comfortable as Mrs. Rice made Nell's
father."
"And then what?" exulted Darrow.
"She merely said he never would get
married until he had courage to ask
for what he wanted," completed Miss
Converse.
"Considering that he'd been dragging
about after her ever since she came
home from school, I guess she could
imagine whom he would ask for,
couldn't she?" crowed Darrow.
"I don't call that urging," protested
Miss Converse.
"She was doing the best she could,"
proclaimed Darrow. "She frightened
him into proposing."
"I don't see how you make that out."
"If he didn't ask her then he was
afraid she would think he was a cow
ard."
"Any man who has not the courage
to propose does not deserve to be mar
ried," she asserted.
"That's not fair," he cried. 'I know
lots of good fellows who simply can't
think what to say."
"Fine fellows they must be," she
laughed. "Fancy a man, a big strong
man, being afraid of a weak woman."
"Say," he began confidently, "do you
know that when a man loves a girl she
looks bigger than the side of a house
sometimes?"
"I hope nobody loves me then," she
said sharply. "A man cannot love a
woman when he applies such a simile
to her."
"That's all you know about it," he
declared sagely.
"Any, man can propose, and propose
nicely, if he really wants a girl," she
insisted.
"I couldn't," he said discouragedly.
"Not even with the aid of a 'Ready
Letter Writer' and a 'Guide to Court
ship.' "
"Nonsense," she dissented. "I'm
sure you could make a pretty speech.
Try it."
"I can't think of a thing," he com
plained after a moment's silence.
"Won't you give a fellow a start?"
"How is this?" she asked. "My
dear Miss Smith "
i "Converse," he corrected.
"I said 'Smith,' " she insisted.
"It don't sound natural with Smith,"
Ihe complained, "make it my dear Miss
Converse. What's next?"
"You only wanted a start," she in
sisted.
"That's only the address," he plead
ed. "Give a fellow a bigger boost
than that."
"Well," she began, "you might say,
'Surely you cannot have failed to have
noticed' ânow go ahead!"
"From the beginning?" he asked.
"Certainly, go ahead," she said im
patiently.
"My dear Miss Converse," he began
rapidly, "surely you cannot have failed
to have noticed that I love you and
want you for my wife. How's that?"
"Too abrupt!" she complained.
"Let's hear you do better," he
Jeered. .
"Surely you canot have failed to
notice that you have inspired in me
a feeling beside which all other senti
ments fade into nothingness."
"Gee! I wish I could do it that
way," interjected Darrow admiringly.
"For a long time but one hope has
filled my mind; the hope that one day
I might be so fortunate as to inspire
a similar feeling within your breast.
I feel that I cannot wait longer for the
answer to a question which will either
fill the whole world with a perfect
radiance or plunge me into the deep
est despair. I love you. Will you not
say that I may hope some day to lead
to the altar the sweetest little woman
in all the world? Now!"
She turned toward him triumphant
ly to meet his admiring gaze.
"Say," he said wonderlngly, *Tve
been trying to tell you something like
that for about three years. Will you,
dear?"
It was some time later that he said
good night.
"Do you think, Nell," he whispered
teasingly, "that the girl in the book
wasn't so bad after all?"
"George Darrow," she stormed, "if i
you ever dare say that I helped you ,
propose, I'll "
He stopped the threat with a kiss. ;
"I don't care who did it," he Said
tenderly, "so long as I've won you."

TALKS ON DIVORCE
WOULD CHECK ABUSES
Tells Convention That Church
Will Educate and Reform.
Clergymen and laymen Identified
with the work of the Protestant Epis
copal church assembled at Grace
Church at the early hour of 9 o'clock
yesterday morning, when the last
meeting of the fifty-fifth convention of
fhe diocese of California was held.
Once more the working capacity of
all concerned was proved and espe
cially of the Right Rev. Bishop
Nichols, who has not only presided
over the convention's deliberations
from early morning until late in the
eveliing, but has preached and de
livered addresses.
There has been some good oratory
on the floor of the house.
The address of Bishop Nichols was a
masterpiece. He reviewed the year's
work, gave an account of his own of
fice, of his travels to the missionary
fields and various parishes. There
v. ere touching references to the losses
sustained by the church through
ilea.ths of clergy and laymen, .and,
turning to the bright side, the Bishop
announced that throughout the diocese
tÂ«>-day there Is better vitality than at
any time he has known it for which
he thanked the clergy and the laity.
Bishop Nichols then treated of di
vorce and remarriage and had this to
say:
.DIVORCE AND REMARRIAGE,
Our diocesan convention Is the first to meet
under the important amendments made by
our general constitutional and canon law,
w>.ich In the main took effect the first day
this month.
Important as are some of the other amend
ments like those looking to courts of appeal,
snd to a more Inclusive Episcopal oversight,
that which undoubtedly Is most Immediate In
its bearings Is the new canon dealing with re
marriage after divorce, and the questions of
discipline involved.
it seems to me but Just in this connection
t accord high honor to those on all sides of
this question who In these recent years have
tn joint commissions and in laborious research
and with pen and voice done so much to
p.ulcken the conscience and clarify the intelli
gence of the church, not to say public senti
ment itself, in this matter, and a chief, yes,
perhaps the chief figure, among them all is
the bishop, or if we might euphonize the
"Dux." as it was fcndly. If accidentally ex
pressed in the last Lambeth conference âthe
Duke of Albany. This position was stalwart,
f<arless. ringing with a leadership to place
marriage on the highest possible plane.
Personally. I could have wished that he could
have carried with him both houses of con
vention as he did at first the house of bishops,
and that for the present, at any rate, our
canon law might have barred our church from
remarriage after dlvpee when there Is a hus
band or wife still living whatever might have
b*en the ground of the decree of divorce.
Few can be more conscious than I of the
hardships, no to say distresses, which come up
out of this sad question, nor more touched
with sympathy for individual cases. But the
safety of the family, like the safety of the
church or state, sometimes becomes the Â»u
--preme law, and in the harm threatened the
family as an institution by the frequency and
flippancy of divorce, or even the freakish sug

VOTES FOR THE CANON.
But while strong in the conviction when It
was evident that the convention as a whole
was not prepared to take the stand against .
any remarriage after divorce. I voted for the 1
canon as It now is because I believe It carries
us a long way toward no remarriage after di
vorce, and further because 1 believe ours la '
singularly a church for leadership by educa
tional rather than by authoritative methods.
Canons are not creeds. Authority on great '
current questions will do very well for those
who begin by recognising the authority. But
for those who do not dictation becomes more or
less of a negligent, not to say nagging, quan-
The American temper Is far more open to
leadership which patiently tries to take the
public mind as it finds it and lift It up for
ever.
Just prior to the time for midday :
prayer Rev. D. J. Evans, rector of
Grace Church, offered the following
resoluUon, which was adoDted:
Resolved, That the sympathy of this con
vention be exnressed for the distracted people
of Kusaia In their present domestic troubles,
with the earnest prayer that Almighty God
may restore to them order out of chaos and
out of discord peace.
Bishop Nichols then offered up a
prayer similar to that of yesterday,
supplicating for the restoraUon of
peace in Russia,
The Rev. E. F. Gee, rector of St.
John's, Oakland, moved the following,
which was carried unanimously: I
Resolved, That a committee be appointed to 1
memorialise tne State Legislature In the usual
mar.ner that the State law relating to marriage
be amended requiring the nublishing of banns
or matrimony In churches or the publishing of
notice ten days previous to performing of mar
riage In ths Courthouse of the county In which
such marriage Is to be performed.

A COMPREHENSIVE PAMPHLET.
A comprehensive pamphlet, well il
lustrated, was presented to the con
vention by the Rev. Burr M. Weeden,
rector of St. Luke's Church, which he
proposed should be adopted for distri
bution among not only the people of
the city but members of the bar
throughout the diocese.
Mr. Weeden's object, as explained
by him, Is that those who are desir
ous of making legacies to any one of
the public institutions of the Episco
pal church of the diocese and others
interested in them may find In the
booklet the information desired.
Members of the bar will have them

stitutions. With it are forms of be

proposition was unanimously
agreed to.
John Landers moved a vote of
thanks to the Rev. David J. Evans,
rector of Grace Church, the vestry
and the choirs and organists, William
H. Holt and Wallace A. Sabin, for the !
use of the church and services ren
dered during the convention. A vote
of thanks to George Warren Hooper
of the Occidental Hotel was also
unanimously passed and Bishop Nich
ols thanked the press for the manner
In which the deliberations of the con
vention had been published.
The convention then adjourned sine
die, Grace Church to be the next place
for the convention.

observed at St Luke's Church, Van

HOLD IMPOSING RECEPTION.
Great Honors Are Shown to Bishop
and Mrs. Nichols.
Bishop and Mrs. Nichols held a re
ception last evening under the aus
pices of the Church Club at the St.
Francis Hotel. It was estimated that
fully 1000 persons attended. There
was a constant stream of men and
women prominent in church and so
cial circles entering the handsome
rooms from 8 until almost 11 o'clock.
With Bishop and Mrs. Nichols and
Miss Nichols were Bishop Logan
H. Roots and Mrs. Roots, who
will leave for Hankow on Saturday.
Bishop Roots was the choice of the
Episcopal convention at Boston for
the episcopate at Hankow, where he
succeeds the lamented Bishop Ingle.
A delightful feature of last even
ing's reception was the entrance of
one of the clergy accompanied by a
large contingent of his congregation.
The divine was the Rev. S. J. Lee,
rector of St. James, who filed past
Bishop and Mrs. Nichols with more
than fifty of his parishioners.
Then there was a large representa
tion of Chinese and Japanese students,
who came to do honor to the distin
guished head of the Episcopal diocese
of California. Apart from those of
the Protestant Episcopal church
there were also numerous members
of the Presbyterian, Methodist and
Congregational churches and students
from the Church Divinity School, San
Mateo.
The reception was one of the largest
of its kind ever held In the city.

THINK FATHER
WAS NOT SANE
Yoell Family Skeletons Are
Dragged Â« Into Daylight
by Two of the Children
DECLARE HE WAS GRUEL j
Miss Beatrice Says Pioneer
Pulled His Wife's Nose
on Keturn From Church
The seamy side of life in the Yoell
home at San Jose was vividly portrayed
by two daughters of the dead Santa
Clara pioneer in Judge Kerrigan's court
yesterday. All the family skeletons
were dragged into the daylight.
' Once he took mamma's nose between
his tingers and twisted it," declared
Miss Beatrice Yoell, the youngest
daughter, a Stanford University stu
dent. 'Then I think he struck her."
"He threw a pack of cards into moth
er's face and called her names that I
cannot repeat," said Mrs. Mary Gene
vieve Parkhurst, another daughter by
the second wife. "My mother's con
duct was that of a martyr toward her
torturer."
The witness related that she once
asked her father for $3 to buy theater
tickets. Though they were on a promi
nent street corner in San Jose at the
time Yoell fell upon his knees, she said,
and lifting his hands to the heavens
cursed his daughter violently.
According to Mrs. Parkhurst, kneeling
was one of the favorite attitudes of her
departed parent. All the witnesses
called yesterday corroborated her tes
timony that he was a man who wept
copiously and often. His profanity, ac
cording to hints dropped, was pecu
liarly potent and original, and between
curses he wept and prayed.
The night after her mother separated
from him, Mrs. Paranurst said, her
father quoted often from "The Prisoner
of Chillon" and "De Profundis." On
that night 'also he uttered the almost
prophetic words, "After me, the de
luge."
At one time, Mrs. Parkhurst said.
Yoell had the hallucination that his
wife and children were trying to poison
him and insisted that some one should
taste the food before he ate it. One
morning he declared that Kirn, the
Chinese cook, had told him that an at
tempt was being made to poison him.
When the Celestial was asked to veri
fy this he said: "You clazy."
Mrs. Annie McNellas, who was em
ployed as seamstress at the Yoell home,
declared that she once saw the pioneer
attempt to use a knife on "Willie"
Yoell. Though she often heard the
father use profane language, she said
that he once told her that he was lead
ing a "very hoi good life."
On cross-examination by D. M. Del
mas Miss McNellas denied that she ever
held both of Yoell's hands at the gar
den gate and offered him words of sym
pathy when he left his home for the
last time.
All of the women witnesses said they
had seen Yoell when the mixed praying
and cursing spells came over him. All
had been accused of plotting and
scheming.
Michael Riegel. barber at Highland
Springs, declared that Yoell "cussed" a
waitress violently. Joseph Kubik Sr.
and Joseph Kubik Jr. gave accounts of
Yoell's eccentricities at Paso Robles.
Attorneys Delmas and Hoefler had
tilts both in the morning and afternoon
sessions, the latter asking for delay and
Delmas objecting firmly. The case will
be resumed at 11 o'clock Monday.

AMATEUR RIDERS IN THE STEEPLECHASE
McBRIDE IN FINE FORM
RIDES THREE WINNERS
Piatt Disposes of
. Edrodun by a
Short Neck.
WAR â¢ES FIRST
Royal Red Gallops
Home Ahead of
His Field.
â¢ Those of the layers In the ring at
" Oakland yesterday who bumped the i
..two choices, Piatt and Bob Ragon. for
the fifth number on the card almost.
Had an eagle bird rung up for them by
Edrodun, the third choice. Not that
the latter ran friendless, but the com
missions he carried were of far lighter
weight than the swell wagers laid on
the first two named starters.
Piatt enjoyed the call over Bob Ra- I
gon, and under McÃride's energetic
'.handling got up Just in time to beat ,
Edrodun a neck. Ragon Is apparently .
a better performer in light, sloppy go- I
ing, for he did not shine to any partic- I
ular advantage, though finishing third.
FIELDS LACK CLASS.
." The different fields were entirely l :
lacking in class, .but the racing was
fairly good. Favorites kept their heads
above water by annexing three of the;
purses. A muddy track brought out:
only the mudlarks.
â¢ There were several uncorkings in the
three-furlong scramble for maiden two
year-olds, and I'm Joe, the mount of
McÃride, decamped with the mazurna.
Opening at 2, the price about Joe went;
to 4, and he won all the way. Syphon
Girl, played down to 8 to 5 favoritism,
finished second, more than two lengths I
ahead of Roman Gold.
Emma Reubold is an improved mare,
for she made a gallop of the five-fur
long dash, starting at odds of 2Vi to L '
Yellow stone, the first choice, took the i
place, beating out Alta G less than a |
length for that position. Bummer, the
supposed good thing, whose odds re
reded from 8 to 4, finished back in the
ruck, Pure Dale quit, as usual.
PRESTANO A WINNER.
â¢ A third favorite fell by the wayside
in the six-furlong run, next decided. }
Dotterel, well backed at 11 to 5, began
'Showing speed when too late and was
not placed. After Pachuca had led all I
tÂ»f her trumps Prestano, a 5 to 1 chance, |
ridden by Lloyd Fountain, assumed the
..lead, beating Blackthorn at the wire I
--less than a length. Pachuca, against j
â¢ whlCh 30 to 1 was laid, grabbed the!
show.
Barney Dreyfuss, the mount of Jakie |
Jones, was touted so strongly that Dick
de . Neffe's gelding went to the post
equal favorite with War Times for the
ir; and fifty yard selling fixture.
.Frangible received some well-meant
but Davis upset the apple cart
by- using his shillelah too vigorously
.on the gelding at the post. After this
going over he sulked. War Times,
astride which Sam Greenfield had the
mount, quickly showed in front, and
Barney Dreyfuss, while taking the
plate, could not overhaul the black
niaro. Taylor, with Mr. Farnum, gath
ered show honors..
As a finale Royal Red, a 3 to 5
chance, made an awful show of his
company in a mile run for maidens.
Ridden by Jakie Jones, the King Wil
liam three-year-old breezed past the
fudges almost pulled to a jog. The Volt
tired badly the last sixteenth, losing
â  the place to Estoy Listo.
TRACK NOTES.
The California Oaks, for three-year
old fillies, at a mile and a furlong, will
be the feature of the card at Oakland
. to-morrow. A strong field will start
in the event, which will be worth about
$3000. Among the ellgibles are Sea Air,
Loretta M. Lady Goodrich, Sea Voy
age, Del Carina, Meada, Marie J and
Princess Zula.
â¢ Indications noint to the field In the
â¢ Burns Handicap, to be run Saturday,
February 4, coming from the following
â¢ list of well-known performers: Claude,
Dainty, Elliott, Military Man, Pasa
dena, Dalvay, Honiton, Gold Money,
Modicum, Rockaway, Ananias, Gate
way, Leila, Bombardier, Horatius, Di
vina, W. R. Condon. Jack Ratlin, Sid
ney C. Love, Schoolmate, Fossil and
Captain Forsee.
Loretta M, the Oaks candidate owned
by Tlchenor & Co., was due to arrive
at Oakland from Los Angeles last
night.
McÃride carried off the saddle honors
at Oakland yesterday by piloting three
winners. The Knebelkamp rider is rap
idly coming to the front and should de
velop into quite a star the coming sea
son.
Every now and then W. Davis allows
his temper to get the better of him.
He usually makes a mess of things
when this happens. He had the mount
on Frangible in the fourth race, and
while at the post fought and beat the
gelding unmercifully. It ruined his
mount's chances, and the judges fined
the young man $25 for his uncalled for
exhibition.

FIND POWDERS
IN HOCH'S DESK
What Is Believed to Be Evi
dence Against the Alleged
Wife Murderer Discovered
CHICAGO, Jan. 26.âFive white pow
ders, supposed to be the kind given to
his wives by Jotiann Hoch, have been
found in an old writing desk which
had been taken from the house at 6430
Union street, formerly occupied by
Hoch. The powders are now in the
hands of the city chemist for analysis.
William Nusser told Police Inspector
Shippey of another alleged wife of
Hoch* Nusser says that Miss Martha
Herefeldt, now living in Pasadena,
Cal., married Hoch in 1895. Nusser
baked the wedding cake. Miss Here
feldt was living with her sister, Mrs.
Mary Burmeister, at the time. Hoch
took $1800 from this woman, it Is al
leged, and also got a few hundred dol
lars from Mrs. Burmeister and dis
appeared.
Allegations of mesmeric influence en
tered to-day into the case of Hoch.
Mrs. Henry Fink of Aurora, 111., one
of Hoch's many wives, charged him
with having mesmerized her into the
union at Aurora in 1902. Mrs. Fink
declared that under the influenco of
the mysterious German she had con
sented to marry him after a five mm
utes' courtship.
A trunk full of books on hypnotism
and mesmerism were left behind by
Hoch when he disappeared from Au
rora three days after the marriage.
Mrs. Fink is about 60 years of age.
Belief that Hoch may prove to be
the elusive and mysterious Edward
Hatch, accomplice of H. H. Holmes,
the notorious woman murderer whose
crimes created excitement all over the
United States and Canada in 1895, has
led the police to begin an investiga
tion along that line. At the time
Holmes made his confession, when in
prison at Philadelphia before his exe
cution. Hatch was generally regard
ed by the police as a mythical charac
ter Invented by Holmes.
That Hoch used the name Hatch or
Hotch as one of his aliases about
eleven or twelve years ago, at the time
of the Holmes outrages, is declared to
have been made known to detectives
working on the case.
Gustav Strelow, an employment
agent, told the police to-day that in
1897 he had dealings with Hoch and at
j that time learned of Hoch's many mar
riage ventures.
"Hoch came to my employment bureau at
44 North Clark street In 1897," said Strelow.
"and asked me to_allow him to look over my
list of applicants for positions as housekeeper.
I save him the list and he inquired If I knew
If any of the applicants had any money.
Shortly after that I saw his advertisement in
a German newspaper asking; to meet a
wealthy German widow. A woman living In
Ontario street, I believe her name was Mar
tha Herefeldt, came Into my office and saw
Hoch's picture on my desk. She Immediately
identified it as that of her husband, who she
said had disappeared after robbing her of her
savings and those of her sister. After that I
saw Hoch with several different ' women.
Many women came to my office and asked for
Hoch's address."
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 28.â Chief of Detectives
Desmond found by Investigation to-day that
Johann Hoch, wanted by the Chicago police
for alleged bigamy and wife poisoning, and
John Schultz, formerly of Bt. Louis, are one
and the same. His investigation extended to
the circumstances surrounding the death of
Mrs. Mary Schultz, wife of John Schulta.
PASADENA. Cal.. Jan. * 28.â Nothing Is
known here of Miss Martha Herefeldt, who is
said to have married Johann Hoch in Chicago
in 1595. Inquiry at various places failed to
develop anything.

NELSON COACHES
BOXER HYLAND
Battling Takes a Deep In
terest in the Youngster
Who Fights in His Style
NEIL ENDS GLOVE WORK
*
His Sensational Bouts With
Young Corbett Are Too
Realistic for His Trainer
Battling Nelson was the star visitor
at the training camp of Dick Hyland at
the Ocean, Beach yesterday and put in
a busy time with the latest recruit to
the ranks of professional boxers. After
boxing four rounds with Hyland Nel
son pronounced him all right and pre
dicts he will give Nell the fight of his
life.
Nelson showed his prototype a num
ber of the blows which have brought
home the money for him. He paid
particular attention to the overhand
blow with which he has done such ter
rible execution. Hyland protects him
self cleverly and is expected to prove a
hard man to hit. Nelson has taken a
deep interest in him and will visit his
training quarters each day this week.
He will also be in his corner on the
night of the fight. As Young Corbett
will be behind Neil the two old op
ponents can fight their battle over
again by proxy.
The men will weigh in at the Pavilion
on the night of tne fight. Neil will
scale several pounds below the reauired
notch while Hyland Is expected to
make the weight easily.
The principal topic of conversation
at Frankie Neil's training quarters at
Billy Shannon's villa yesterday was
ducks as the result of the fruitless
shooting expedition of Young Corbett.
Frankie has gained a pound laughing
over the affair. He says if he beats
Hyland, he will present each of the
would-be hunters with a little gold
duck.
In the morning Neil and Corbett took
an eight-mile run over the- highways
of Marin. Corbett is in Neil's class on
the level roads but going over a hill
Frankie has him beaten a block. Cor
bett's only chance of keeping up with
the little bantam is to engage him in
conversation.
During the afternoon Frankie enter
tained a few friends and they spent
an hour in the gymnasium punching
the bag, skipping the rope, pulling the
weights and shadow fighting.
Trainer McDonald has ordered box
ing cut out as he is afraid of his pro
tege injuring his hands In his realistic
bouts with young Corbett. McDonald
expects to send Neil into the ring
weighing about 118 pounds. Frankie
looks the picture of health and is get
ting Impatient for the gong to sound.
He is a bundle of nervous energy and
seems tireless.

ARMED ROBBERS
CHASE RANCHER
Pursue Him Over Hills In
tent on Securing $2000 He
Had in His Possession
Special Dispatch to The CalL
BOULDER CREEK, Jan. 26.âAn or
ganized gang of desperadoes has made
its headquarters on Kings Creek, five
miles from here, in the vicinity of Bear
Rock. Late Monday evening one of
their number went to the ranch of
Franklin Waters on the Fat Buck and
asked for a place to lay his blankets.
His peculiar actions aroused suspicion
and as Waters had $2000 to pay off
the men working on the ranch and was
unarmed, he arose about 3 o'clock
Tuesday morning, hitched his horse to
a buggy and started for town. Waters
had nearly reached the foot of a long
hill leading from the ranch when he
was startled by hearing hoofbeats on
the road In his rear. An armed man
was pursuing him and, whipping his
horse, he commenced a mad race for
life and money. As he dashed by a
road at the foot of the hill three more
mounted robbers Joined in the pursuit,
but Waters kept ahead. The pace was
too fast, so, reaching a protecting
curve in the road slightly in advance
of the foremost robbers, who had now
been Joined by four more on foot, he
leaped from the Iwggy and took to the
high brush. Though hotly pursued
through the brush and over the hills
for three hours he finally reached the
ranch of a neighbor, where, after a
pitched battle, he drove off his pur
suers.
A bright moon was shining at the
time of the attempted robbery and
Waters thinks he recognized two of
the robbers as former employes, who
recently returned from the Philippines.

BAY CITY BOYS
CAPTURE PRIZE
Oakland Wheelmen Beaten
Out by a Small Margin
in Home Trainer Contest
GOOD FORM IS SHOWN
Trout Makes the Best Time
for the Night With Mc-
Whirter a Close Second
The Bay City Wheelmen showed a
large crowd at Native Sons' Hall last
night they could ride on the home
trainers in championship form. After a
nose and nose finish with the riders
from Oakland the Bay Cities managed
to creep into the lead in the final con
test and captured the trophy in the an
nual tryout of the New Century
Wheelmen by two-fifths of a second.
The roller races created much inter
est among cycling men and Native
Sons* Hall was crowded when the ini
tial race was announced. The contest
was between Randall of the Bay City
Wheelmen and D. Francis of the New
Century Wheelmen. Randall had the
speed and gradually drew away from
his opponent. He went the two miles in
2:30 1-5 and won the race in a canter.
F. H. McLaughlin, the pride of the
Bay City Wheelmen, never had a
chance against A. Trout of the Oak
land Wheelmen in the second contest.
Trout developed an early burst of
speed and led all the way, winning the
race in 2:291-5, the best time of the
night. R. Neff of the Oakland Wheel
men gave T. McGrath, the California
Cycling man. a beating in the next con
test. Neff seemed to possess the grit
and stayed with the grind all the way.
He nosed out handily. Time 2:37.
E. Holden of the California Cycling
Club beat L. S. Cunningham of the
New Century Wheelmen in the fourth
event, his time being 2:39. H. McWhlr
ter, the Bay City's representative in
the final event of the night, rode away
from A. Daggett of the California Cy
cling Club, winning the event in 2:31,
the second best time for the night. Mc-
Whlrter rode a strange wheel in this
race, and but for that he might have
beaten the time made by Trout of the
Oakland Wheelmen, who broke the rec
ord for the night In the second race.
The winning team was presented with
a handsome loving cup by Geprge
Dixon, master of ceremonies of the
evening. The Oakland Wheelmen, who
came in second, also received a hand
some trophy. After the races were
over dancing was begun and lasted till
an early hour in the morning.
HUNTERS FACE
A SLOW DEATH
For Eight Weeks They Live
on the Flesh of Goats on
the Island of Guadaloupe
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 26.âAfter living
for more than eight weeks on a diet of
goat meat upon the barren island of
Guadaloupe, R. H. Weaver of San
Francisco is now in San Diego recuper
ating before returning home. N. J.
Weaver, the father of the young man,
has a concession from the Mexican
Government to slaughter goats upon
the island, which is one hundred miles
oft the coast of Lower California. The
nearest place upon the mainland is a
mining camp named San Quintin.
which is several hundred miles below
the line.
Four months ago young Weaver was
landed upon the island with five Mexi
cans to kill goats. Eight weeks ago
their provisions ran out. They had no
boat with which to reach the mainland
and no craft is in the habit of calling
at the island. Goats furnished the only
food the party could get and these were
a considerable distance from the camp.
To make matters worse Weaver's
supply of cartridges gave out and he
was compelled to use a shotgun, neces
sitating a close approach to the goats
in order to kill them. A goat every day
was required to feed the men. The
Mexicans finally mutined and Weaver
threatened to shoot them unless they
quieted down.
Weaver and his party were rescued
by the steamer St. Denis, which was
passing the island. When rescued
Weaver was at work building a boat
with which he hoped to reach the main
land. He believes that the rescue came
in the nick of time as he had only a
few charges of powder and shot left
and would have been unable to kill
more than enough food to last a few
days.

HUNTERS TO GO
OVER THE JUMPS
Amateur Horsemen to Per
form at Ingleside Track
on Washington's Birthday
GOOD SPORT PROMISED
Charley Dunphy and Other
Riders Will Have Many
Fine Mounts Available
The officials of the California Polo
and Pony Racing: Association have
been granted the use of Ingleside race
course for February 22 and will give
the people of this city a taste of the
exciting sport which has reached a high
development at Ban Mateo.
The sensational feature of the card
will be a two-mile hunt steeplechase
over the course through the field. This
will be open to qualified hunters which
have been ridden with the drag hounds
of the San Mateo County Hunt. The
minimum weight will be 160 pounds.
There will be a large field from which
to draw entries. Francis J. Carol an,
master of Crossways, has seven hun
ters all of excellent type in his stables.
J. Downey Harvey has three fine hun
ters which he purchased in the East
recently. Charles W. Clark has two,
while J. J. Moore has several. Includ
ing the famous Bridesmaid, with which
he has hunted. R. M. Tobin will also
be represented.
If Charley Dunphy does not consider
his great Jumping pony Del Monte up
to a race he can probably have his pick
of the mounts, as he is a finished art
ist ever the Jumps.
The steeplechase will be only one) of
the features of a card which will bring
out the cleverest ponies owned on thi
coast and the best of the gentlemen
Jockeys.
A half-mile race has been added to
the card for the matinee meeting sched
uled for one week from to-morrow. Aa
this will be Burns handicap day, it la
expected the Pony Association officials
will postpone their meeting another
week. President Williams is a gener
ous patron of their association and they
will probably help swell the throng
which annually views this rich stake
of the New California Jockey Club.
W. S. Hobart's smart pony Marigold,
with which he has won three match
races, was remeasured yesterday and
came in under the standard of four
teen and a half hands. It was thought
she had outgrown the pony class and
that she would not start again.

TUG FROM WRECK IN BREAKERS
Four-Master Safely
Anchored in As
toria Harbor.
Â»
Blockade Runners
Crew Attacked
by Cold Feet
The schooner Mahukona, which was
reported yesterday morning In the
breakers of the Columbia River bar and
ih imminent danger of destruction, is
safely anchored in Astoria harbor. The
tug Tatoosh, which was sent to her
assistance, got a line to her about 1:30
a. m., and after a long struggle
dragged the fourmaster from the rocks
and towed her safely into port.
The Mahukona, which is owned by
Hind, Rolph & Co. of this city, was
bound from San Pedro for Astoria. She
sailed safely over the Columbia River
bar and would have winged her way
to port but for the sudden failure of
the wind. Becalmed in the swell that
always rolls high in the vicinity of the
bar, the Mahukona could offer no re
sistance to the strong ebb tide that
carried her slowly toward the break
ers. After wafting as long as he dared,
in hope of a breeze, the Mahukona's
skipper dropped anchor in time to save
his vessel from the rocks. The Mahu
kona would have been all right then
until the turn of the tide, which at
flood would have taken her Into port,
had not a storm developed. As the
night wore on the wind's velocity in
creased and the fiercer the gale the
more dangerous became the Maku
kona's predicament.
Life saving crews went to the schoon
er's aid, but could not get near her on
.account of the heavy sea. The tug Ta
toosh was sent to her assistance, but
the captain of the towboat had little
hope of being able to save the vessel.
He tried, however, and succeeded after
some hours in getting lines on board
the schooner. The Tatoosh is a power
ful tug and, fortunately for the Ma
hukona and those on board her, proved
able to overcome the elements that
combined in the effort to drive the sail
ing vessel to destruction.
The Mahukona is a four masted
schooner of 653 net tons register. She
was'built In 1901 at Hoquiam.
Crew Got Cold Feet.
The Japanese are maintaining an extremely
effective vigil outside of Vladivostok. The
.news dispatches telling of the capture of
nearly all vessels attempting to reach the
Russian port wit . contraband contain cold
comfort for the officers and crews of ships
chartered for blockade running. The steamer
Olympia. which left Seattle some days ago
f->r the Orient, supposedly for Vladivostok, and
which returned to the Puget Sound port in a
, disabled condition, is said to have* been dis
abled by her own crew. It was reported on
the Merchants' Exchange yesterday that the
people on the Olympia. after getting to sea
and thinking over the enterprise upon which
they were embarked, decided that the Japanese
were too vigilant and that they would he.!
more certain of their freedom if the Olympia
returned to Seattle. To insure this the yes- i
pel's boilers were so tampered with that there
was nothing else for the captain to do but
to turn back. And he did.
, .
The Burglar Escaped.
Captain Anderson, the Pacific Mall Com
pany's chief of police. Is mourning the loss |
of a burglar captured on the wharf Wednes- |
day night. The Anderson watchman service j
is as perfect as anything of the kind In opera
. tlon anywhere. Anderson's personal vigilance ;
is eternal and insures such strict attention to 1
duty on the part of his subordinates that theft j
on the Mail wharf is almost unknown. Ar- ]
rest invariably follows any attempt to tamper i
. with the valuable merchandise piled high all :
over the wharf. The burglar of Wednesday
night was discovered trying to pry his way ;
Into a storehouse.
"Get in there" said Anderson, giving the
outlaw a strong-arm Jolt which sent the pro
â¢ feasor of burglary reeling Into Captain Wil
son's office on the dock.
"That's the safest place," remarked Ander
son aa he turned the key In the lock. "Wil
son Is on the Manchuria and won't want to ;
use his office anyway. He'll be safe all right.
Now I'll go and telephone for the patrol
â¢ wagon."
As Anderson went into the telephone booth
''attain Wilson came swinging up the wharf.
Unlocking the door of his office he stepped
Inside to find the place occupied.
-"What are you doing here?" demanded WII
son.
"I'm waiting for Captain Anderson," aald
the burglar meekly.
"Anderson'( office is next door. Go to
out of this."
The burglar waited for no second invitation, i
and vanished. Wilson settled down at his desk !
ar.d was deep In the problem of figuring how
to get a piece of freight ten feet square
through a six by eight hatch when with a
clatter of hoofs and ringing of gongs the
-patrol wagon backed up to the office door.
"There he Is," said Anderson, flinging open
the door.
Anderson would not speak to Wilson for
three hours.

COUNSEL MOVE
FOR ACQUITTAL
Chun Ho, one of the four Chinese
slaves alleged to have been Imported
to this country for Immoral purposes
by Lee Toy and Da Sllva, was cross
examined yesterday in the United
States District Court by Bert Schles
inger of counsel for Lee Toy and by
Thomas C. West, counsel for Da Silva.
She asserted that she had not agreed
to come to this country for that pur
pose. She also asserted that she and
the three other slaves âLeung Ah
Duck, Lee Gum Kew and Yuen Tsoy
Fungâhad never conversed together
with relation to the charges made
against the defendants. All that they
had talked about, she said, was to
speculate whether they had gone to
St. Louis and how long they would
remain there.
Hart H. North, "United States Im
migrant Commissioner and Chief Chl
inese Officer at the port of San Fran
cisco," was called to testify to the fact
that Lee Toy and Da Silva, represent
ing the Wong Yu Sun, sub-concession
aries of the Chinese Village Company
at the St. Louis Exposition, had called
upon him and presented bonds for
$500 each for 172 men and twelve
women, who arrived by the steamship
Doric on August 6. Bonds were not
accepted by the witness for the four
v omen who had testified in the case
and Lee Toy and Da Silva were in
formed that the women would not be
permitted to go to St. Louis. All the
rest were allowed to go there and at
the close of the exposition were re
turned to China in conformity with
the regulations.
Assistant United States District At
torney Ben L. McKlnley objected to
this line of cross-examination by Sam
uel M. Shortridge. Mr. Shortridge ex
plained that he wished to show that
the testimony of the women was false,
because in the very nature' of things
it was impossible for the defendants
to have prevented the return of the
women to China, as their admission
was sought for the specific purpose of
going to the St. Louis Exposition. Un
der the regulations they were to be
taken thither under guard of Chinese
Bureau officials and were to be re
turned to this city and deported to
China In the same manner as the rest.
The counsel proposed to show at the
proper time that under the circum
stances it was Impossible for the de
fendants to have meditated the offense
with which they had been charged.
Charles Mehan, chief of the Chi
nese Bureau, testified that he saw Lee
Toy talking to one of the four com
plainants in the rooms of the Chinese
Bureau after the women had been ex
amined by the officers of the bureau.
Hd ordered Lee Toy to cease talking
to the women, and the Chinese did so.
This closed the case for the Govern
ment. â
Mr. Shortridge moved to strike out
all the evidence as to allege extra
judicial admissions of the defendants
because there was no other evidence
at all tending to show that any crime
whatever had been committed. He
read from opinions by Justice Field,
United States District Judge Hoff- s
man, State Supreme Judges McFarland
and Garoutte and others. The coun
sel then moved that the jury should
be Instructed to render a verdict of
acquittal upon the ground of the In
sufficiency of the evidence to estab
lish the charge. Thomas C. West
made a similar plea on behalf of Da
Silva.
The court adjourned until 10 a. m.
to-day.
Did you ever know a Kentuckian who
didn't carry something odd in the way
of a pistol, a knife or a bottle?
GRAIN DEALERS
SPEAK OF TOLLS
The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
exchanged views with a delegation
from the Merchants' Exchange. The
topic discussed related to the proposi
tion of the board to amend the rules
by increasing duty on grain and flour
in order to prevent a congestion of
freight on the seawall. The merchants
were represented by Charles S. Lav-
Â§ leister, Simon Erlanger, E. W. Fergu
on, R. A. Bray, W. C. Barnard and
H. C. Somers. The president of the
Harbor Commission, Charles H. Spear,
and Commissioner John D. Mackenzie
explained that the purpose of the pro
posed new rules, or the modification of
existing rules, was not to impose addi
tional charges on grain, but to hasten
the removal of freight from the
wharves.
The grain men contended that the
lack of warehouse facilities in San
Francisco Dlaced this port at a disad
vantage. A suggestion was made that
warehouses should be constructed on
land under State jurisdiction. The dis
cussion disclosed the fact that the
members of the committee were not of
one mind. The majority opposed any
departure from the present system of
admitting grain free from any charge
whatever. Mr. Erlanger, however, was
willing to accept a toll of 2% cents a
ton and the imposition of an additional
toll of 2% cents if the grain was not
removed within three days.
WANT THIRTY DAYS.
Mr. Barnard contended that thirty
days' time should be given on sections
one and two of the seawall in order to
meet the rates in Mission Bay and
Port Costa. Messrs. Ferguson and Bar
nard called particular attention to the
fact that there were no charges at Port
Costa other than the warehouse tax of
25 cents a ton for thirty days. The same
charge prevailed at Mission Bay.
Mr. Barnard said: "We want to avoid
the warehouse charge in San Francisco
of 50 cents a ton. Give us thirty days
and we can avoid it. A rule requiring
us to remove the grain within fifteen
days would work a hardship."
Mr. Ferguson remarked that nearly
all the grain coming to this port was
handled on a margin of 25 cents a ton.
"The knowledge of free delivery on the
sea wall brings grain here."
Mr. Erlanger said that large quan
tities of wheat came from the north
to reinforce the wheat of this State.
The* grain landed here free of charge
and was moved within three days. He
dwelt at length on the fact that the
sea wall was constructed to encourage
shipments of grain to this city and it
was the original purpose to make de
livery absolutely free.
Commissioner Spear said the gross
receipts of the sea wall last year did
not exceed $1200. He declared that the
Commissioners were not looking for
additional revenue. They wanted to
help the grower, the commission man
and the shippers. Rules, however,
would be necessary to prevent conges
tion of freight on the wharves. The
board did not propose hasty action.
Time would be given for ample hear
ing. He did not hold to the opinion
that flour and bran, manufactured ar
ticles, should be, like wheat and corn,
exempt from all charges. Potatoes and
beans had to pay 5 cents a ton and, in
his judgment, a similar charge should
be imposed on flour.
OPPOSE INCREASE OF TOLLS.
Mr. Ferguson said the flour that came
here was promptly delivered. It was a
perishable commodity. No one in the
flour business would keep flour on the
sea wall for three days. "We ought to
have flour free," he declared.
Mr. Erlanger said no other city In
the world had a water line like that of
San Francisco. All the facilities were
here and the business would come here
or go to Port Richmond.
The subject of amending the rules
was placed under advisement, with the
understanding that no definite action
would be taken without again hearing
from the grain and flour men.
The following bide for repairing the
Southern Pacific wharf in Central Basin
were received:
Southern Pacific Company $7000
City Street Improvement Company 8420
Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Company 65H>
Healy & TlbbltU 6240

The contract was awarded to the

est bidder.
M. J. Hanley was appointed wharf
inger to succeed C. G. Jillson, whose
term of four years has expired. The
change will take place February L
McDermott Inhales Gas.
Frank McDermott, a doorkeeper at
the Majestic Theater, preferred to oc
cupy a dressing-room in the theater
last Wednesday rather than go home
in the fog to his residence at 26 Louis
street To make himself comfortable
in his quarters he lit a gas heater in
the room and went to sleep. Yester
day morning he was found in an un
cosclous condition caused by the gas
that escaped from the heater. At the
Emergency Hospital Dr. Herxog re
vived him from his stupor.

WHITE'S HINTS
ARE RESENTED
ClHnie Attempts to Probe
Statement About Deeds
Signed by General's Wife
c
RULES QUESTION OUT
Judge Coffey Stops a Line
of Examination at Its
Most Interesting Point
The rents of the Clunie building, the
employment of the legal services of D.
M. Delmas and the settlement of Mrs.
Florence Clunle's contest of Thomas J.
Clunie'B will were the three main points
of the Inquisition in Judge Coffey's
court yesterday In the matter of An
drew Clunle's objections to the account
of Executors E. A. Brldgford and Bur
rell G. White. 'The digressions Indulged
in by Clunie, White and Judge Coffey
were merely spicy variations of an ex
amination so interesting that the court
was loth to cut it short at the hour for
adjournment. Hostilities will be re
newed next Wednesday afternoon.
Of most Importance was Clunie's fail
ure to get a statement from White as
to the reason for the compromise of
Mrs. Clunie's contest. It was brought
out that General Clunie and his wife
had terminated their marital relations
and settled their property rights some
time before the general's death. White
was in Clunie's office when Mrs. Clunie
arrived to make the settlement, and
after she had signed certain papers
purporting to be deeds White went for
Notary Ralph Wilson. The notary, said
White, held all of the papers in his
hand at once and asked Mrs. Clunie If
she acknowledged their execution. She
replied In the affirmative, and Wilson
took the papers to his office. White said
that during his presence only the deed
to the Turkland property was men
tioned by General Clunie. There was,
however, another deed to valuable prop
erty in the bunch of papers, and
White's manner of expressing the fact
caused Andrew Clunie to shout excited
ly, "Do you mean to insinuateâto make
this court believe âthat General Clunie
obtained Mm. Clunle's signature to pa
pers without her knowledge?"
Lawyer and witness sparred with
words, and White finally said, "Weil,
you dragged the statement from me."
QUESTION NOT ADMITTED.
"Was your belief that General Clunie
had done this thing your reason, as ex
ecutor, for paying Mrs. Clunie $150,000
to settle her contest?" Walter. Robin
son, White's attorney, interposed an
objection, and Clunie cried, "You are
not going to throw out slurs here with
out an explanation." White asked the
court if he was obliged to answer the
question, and the court ruled that he
was not.
Relentlessly Clunie pursued the topic.
He learntd that White had "not told a
living soul" of the suspicion, except
ing his wife and Judge Bridgford. He
admitted that it had been discussed as
a possibility with Mr. Delmas after
the latter had been employed to give j
advice as to the contest. Thi* impelled
Clunie to question the executor as to j
the authority for Delmas' employment, j
White said that he had been employed
by Bridgford, he (White) thinking that
the fee would not be so large if the
attorney were hired by one executor j
instead of by both. Judge Coffey
smiled 'broadly at ihis statement and
remarked: "I am glad that he was
not hired by both to advise in mat- >
ters of this estate if I have to pass !
upon his fee." Delmas has already
asked the c< urt to allow him $750" for
six weeks' service.
t'lunie asked why he had not been
told about Ih*- deeds when they were
first discovered. White replied: "You
told me you or your brother would con- ,
test the will, and Tor a while we would
have nothing to do with you. T , have j
tried to he easy with you in this mat- ]
ter," continued White, and Clunie In- j
terrupted: "1 want you to get over
that and lay it on me as hard as pos- I
sible."
GRANT PAYS XO RENT.
The examination of the rents of the j
Clunie building put White in two I
positions â thst < f lessee of the j
building and executor of the es
tate. His attorney objected to his â 
examination in regard to his accounts I
as lessee, but the < ourt held that he j
was accountable as executor. The evl- i
denee developed that Judge Grant, the
attorney whose fee is the basis of one
of the objections, has occupied the
rooms formerly occupied by General
Clunie and has not paid rent therefor,
excepting for two months in 1903. White
maintained that, as lessee, he had
a right to so permit their occupancy,
particularly as no rent had been paid
by Clunie in his lifetime after White
had taken the ler.se.
NEWSPAPER MAN PASSES AWAY.
Robert MacMullen. Well-Known
Writer, Dies After Long
Illness.
Robert <l. MacMullen. for years a
well known newspaper man of this rity.
passed away yesteFday afternoon at the
Lane Hospital, after a long illness. Mr.
MacMullen had been suffering from pa
ralysis for some months, and his friends
were not surprised at his demise.
Mr. MacMullen was a native of New
Jersey and but 28 years old. He cam-?
to this city about ten years ago and en
gaged in newspaper work. He had
been employed at different times on
The Call and other papers, besides hold
ing responsible positions on several
journals in the southern part of the
State. . Mr. MacMullen was a bright
writer and was popular with his fellow
workers. His last work was as a re
porter on The Call. This he had to
abandon three months ago by reason Of
illness.

MacMullen. and five brothersâJames

and Martha MacMullen. No arrange
ments have been made for the funeral.

SHIFT OF JOBS
IS INAUGURATED
Commissioner Boyne Re
signs to Make Way for Su
pervisor Finn's Promotion
TO BE POLICE SECRETARY
O'Grady May Be Put on Elec
tion Board if Devoto Con
sents to Champion Mayor
The "shift" of several city official*
which was foretold by The Call two
weeks ago was Inaugurated yesterday
when Fire Commissioner Boyne filed
his resignation with Mayor Schmltz to
j take effect on the Ist of next month.
| Boyne assigns no reason for his resig-
I nation, but will sever his connection
j with the Fire Department to accept a
better position, in all likelihood the sec-
I retaryship ef the Police Commission,
and also to aid the Mayor'in his plan
to appoint a Supervisor who will de
fend him arid his administration in the
Board of Supervisors against the Mc-
Nab contingent.
As already outlined Boyne's resigna
tion will enable the Mayor to make Su
pervisor Thomas Finn a Fire Commis
sioner, Finn having agreed to the
transfer. Finn's resignation as Super
visor has not yet been filed, but will be
in a few days, so that the "shift" may
be put into effect on February 1 next.
It will be remembered that Boyne did
not take kindly to the offer of the Po
lice Board secretaryship ten days ago,
but finally agreed to set aside his per
sonal feelings.
The Mayor would not announce the
name of the man whom he will appoint
to succeed Finn on the Board of Su
pervisors. Election Commissioner
James A. Devoto has been mentioned
as the man most likely to be named,
but it is held that the charter provision
prohibiting the appointment of an Elec
tion Commissioner to any other office
within one year after the expiration of
his term might interfere with the plan.
This provision, however, did not mili
tate against the transfer of former
Election Commissioner Boyle to the
Board of Education and may be ig
nored in Devoto's case on the pre
sumption that the charter provision
noted is clearly unconstitutional. De
voto will be the man unless the Mayor
has some other attorney capable of
taking up the cudgels in his behalf on
the Board of Supervisors. If Devoto
is transferred Alexander O'Grady will
be appointed Election Commissioner.
O'Grady recently declined She Police
Board secretaryship.
The friends of David J. Oliver Jr. are
confident that he will be appointed
Election Commissioner in case of a va
cancy. Oliver is highly thought of by
the Mayor and has come wtihin an ace
of appointment on commissions in the
past.
The Mayor said that he had not
made up his mind as to the successor of
former Police Commissioner H. W.
Hutton, who was removed Wednesday
under sensational circumstances. The
new Commissioner, however, will be a
Democrat in politics and there will be
no lack of candidates.
The shift of city officials will include
the transfer of Secretary James de
Succa of the Park Commission to the
storekeepership of the Board of Educa
tion or else to the secretaryship of the
Board of Works which Morris Levy
desires to relinquish. Herbert Schmitz.
who resigned from the Board of Works,
will have his old job as secretary of the
Park Commission back again. Since
Boyne has been decided upon for sec
retary of the Police Commission, the
office of Registrar, from which it is
said George Adams will retire, will
leave a fine opening for some aspiring
politician. John Fitzgerald, Barney
Flood and George Berger are hopeful of
landing one of the plums not otherwise
gobbled up.
Many Animals Killed in Park.
Policeman George Clarke, whose duty
is to kill all animals and birds that en
ter the park and prey upon the animals,
made his annual report of the number
ot vagrants that fell to his rifle during
the last year. It is as follows: 139 cats,
27 dogs, S8 bluejays, 45 hawks. 11
weasels, 52 squirrels and one silver
coated fox.

THE FEELING EN WALL STREET.
Outlook Good, but a Warning Note
Sounded, Nevertheless,
â² IÂ»SSjW| financial circular of Wall street
has ins following:
Borne of th*. roads are now beginning to
real ths benefit* of the. big outlays of the last
two years, and If earnings continue on the
present seals no material recession in the
Values of good railroad properties is at present
In sight. Th* railroads, however, are not
entirely free of vicissitudes. Publlo feeling
Is rising against oppressive railroad manage
ment and the threatened strike on the Penn
sylvania system Is a disturbing Issue, inas
much as it may stimulate a revival of labor
-diffloultles. A* for railroad legislation, if It
goes nor. farther than the stoppage of rebates
and securing of equal treatment of all ship
pers, that- will olearly benefit the railroads;
â rut any attempt by th* Government to fix
th* rata would be a revolution in our eco
bozmto and political system and expose us to
â srIOHS disturbance In valuta.
"General trade continues active for the sea-
Kand th* country is now dlstlnotty feeling

nocnon plantar* Are doing well, having sold
mam than half of their cotton at 9c and being
Suits oapahle of holding the balance of the
Crop tor better prloes If. they choose. Fig Iron
brodnotian is going along at a record-breaking
fate; and. WhU* th* top notch has probably
been reached, this great Industry is certainly
â¢njoytng a rirrtyal of prosperity not dreamed
t*f S year ago. Building operations are also
[ililf leas His at a rat* unusual for this season
pt the year snd are likely to continue unless
mtasTUpted by a fresh outbreak of labor
agitation. Money is plentiful at easy rates
and, though the demands from business chan
faais are increasing, there is little prospect of
guy advance in rates until the April set.tle
tnattts approach. Somewhat higher rates than
bow exist would be wholesome, for jf profit
' able employment cannot be found in legitimate
Onaxmels more hazardous uses are sure to be
found for idle capital. The present super
abundance of money Is one of the chief sup
ports of the stock market at present and is
' still reflected in the good Investment demand
for bonds, which continues active and has ex
ceeded all expectations.
THE STOCK SITUATION.
"The stock market situation just now. is one
that demands much caution. There are pow
erful cliques ready to take advantage of a
good business situation and to manipulate first
one stock and then another, endeavoring by
â repeated advances to secure a larger follow
ing and thus create an active market. If
nothing interferes they will probably succeed,
since there Is little. If any, antagonism as
yet from other large operators. But there are
other facts to be remembered. Stocks have
j been steadily passing from strong Into Weaker
lands; and the big. banking Interests are not
actively committed to the long side. They be
lieve* that, all the strong factors in the situa
tion have.- been amply discounted by present
high prices; all the good, news about increased
dividends, etc., having been known to them
for weeks past. Anti-railroad, anti-trust and
Bnti-tariff agitation do not promote connd> n<-e.
Moreover, the situation abroad requires watch
ing. Russia Ufaeasery distressed. The Czar's
life has aealn been endangered and' Russia's
I c redit Is under' the severest sort of strain.
Only by most extraordinary measures â¢is that
credit nrjrported and. should It break cony.
all the principal financial markets of the world.
Including our own, would feel'the blow.' The
local clique* which are, now no successfully
manipulating thla market .may carry prices' to
a still higher plane; but there are sufficient
forces at work to render thei* success â¢ in
creasingly difficult, if not precipitating sharp
reactions when least expected."
The Cotton Market.
Wirea from fiew York yesterday said of
cotton:
"The ginners' report gives for 215. counties
0.094.476 bales; last year, 2,849,178. Counting
round bales as half bales, 8,064,551, against
e,Â£6Â«.217.
â¢ ".The local feeling being so bearish, they
started to depress th* market or* the prelim
inary ginners' report. It sold off some few
points and rallied easily, but was very nervous
during th* rest of the session.- The spot mar
kst in the South Is again firm, with a better
demand. As there are many ways of figuring
the ginners* report. It keeps the average trader
very much confused as to an opinion on the
market.
"While ths proposed reduction In acreage
woold Indicate a prospective smaller yield of
cotton for next season, an agreement of this
kind cannot be regarded as IndlcaUve of final
results. For this reason the ginners' report
and ths Indicated large yield for this season
Xl be th* practical Influence In the market,
nners and traders realise that there is an
enormous quantity of cotton now held back,
sshlch eventually must be offered, for sale, and
. the knowledge naturally militates against the
Assalopment of any bullish feeling. Some
farther decline is not Improbable, and we
Spoold W*rer to wait a lower level before tak

'New York Stock Market,
WW TOKK. Jan. 26,âThe effects ot the
' 'great storm on stocks were perceptible to-day
only in the restricted volume of dealings, the
attendance at ths Stock Exchange being a
'good, deal curtailed. But while dealings were
on a small scale, the tone was clearly strong.
Th* widespread obstruction of traffic and the
Interruption to earning power by the storm
were evidently considered to have had their
due effect in yesterday's decline. That de
cline, following two previous days, was re
garded as having reached adequate limits and
to have approached ths point of risk of over
selling the market. The professional element,
therefore, reversed Its attitude and bought
stocks to-day. The bright weather following
the storm is not to be ignored as an influence
op the speculative sentiment in a market so
Strictly professional and where so large a
â¢ proportion of the dealing* originate in the
board room itself, any more than the severe
weather of yesterday was to bo lost sight of
'as a contributory influence tp the gloomy tone
which prompted the selling Of stocks. The
tr>ne" of foreign markets gave a cheerful Im
pulse to the opening ooura* of the market.
The proclamation issued at St. Petersburg was
accepted as an indication that the Russian
Government stlil has the situation well in
. hand and that the agitation of the public
mind there was subsiding. Rumors also con
tinued to circulate of a likelihood of overtures
toward mediation to end the Russo-Japanese
war. Price* of Americans were up in Lon
don before the opening, here and buying for
foreign â¢ account followed when our market
.opened. Stocks which were most acutely de-
yesterday were most affected on the
recovery -to-day. Amalgamated Copper, from
which the dividends came off. was especially
in demand, with considerable effect on senti
ment. The recently conspicuous .firmness of
the Erie securities was still noticeable and
strengthened the current supposition that this
property is to figure in some important com
ing railroad deal- The cotton carriers were
strong,. apparently on account of the corro
borative evidence contained In the Census
Bureau's cotton ginning report that the prea
Â«nt crop would be a bumper .one. The most
conspicuous movements of the day were in
specialties, not all of which were explained.
The strength of the Chicago. Terminal issues
was connected with the reorganization plan.
Southern Pacific was. firm on the expected
benefit of .the refunding plan. Atchison was
.Inclined to lag apparently from dissatisfac
tion at its bond issue. The clearing out of
weak speculative accounts by yesterday's sharp
'reaction normally benefited the technical sit- '
uatlon of the market. Rates for time money
further bardened to some extent, which is the
only effect perceptible from the continued large
demand for our gold. Remittances to Cuba
on account of the Cuban loan subscriptions,
the last installment of which remains to be.
paid, will soon be added to these requirements.
Discounts - were easier in London to-day and
the pries of gold there was reduced, white
sterling at Parts ross a fraction. Rates for
exchange here were held steady. With the
gathering force of the upward movement
stocks became fairly buoyant later in the day,
most of the laggards being brought forward
to share in the market, and the closing was
very strong.
Bonds were strong. Total sales, .par value.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provision*.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20.âWheat opened strong
and higher. Receipts in the Northwest were
restricted and the cables showed strength in
futures abroad. May started with a gain of
%O%C at $1 15%01 10- Commission houses I
with selling orders around $1 18 brought about
a recession to $1 15%01 15%, Out their of
ferings were eagerly absorbed by purchasers
tor short account. Advices generally, both
from the Northwest and Southwest, were to
the effect that the cash demand was improv
ing and holders were inclined to wait for
higher pricea Advices of receipts of large
shipments at Kansas City and a further re
port that the farmers have no wheat to ship
fave a new impetus to valuss. May touched
1 16%Â®1 18% and ruled strong during the
remainder of the day. Indications that South
western millers will soon have need to replen
ish depleted stocks were alsot given considera
tion by speculatora The closing figure*, at
81 16%. were within a shade under the top
price of the day. -â 
Early trading in corn was active, but almost
wholly of a professional character. May was
unchanged to a shade higher on the opening

tional advances till the close, which was at
the best price of the dayâ4fl%c for May de
livery.
Oats were firm, hut dull and neglects*. May,
which started unchanged to a shade higher
at 30%Â©31 c, became firm at 31 %c closing at

Demand by packers and some of ths com
mission houses induced by light receipts of

Receipts of southern vegetables were liberal
and, as a good portion of the offerings were
rain-damaged and otherwise poor, lower prices
ruled for most descriptions. Mushrooms and
Hothouse Cucumbers were more plentiful and
prices of both had a wider range.

Butter, Cheese and Egg?.
There was no further advance in Butter or
Eggs yesterday and among the trade the opin
ion prevailed that the advance had reached
its limit. There was more BuUer on the floors
than for a week past and the advance has
rendered buyers very vary of the market and
they are taking only enough to carry them from
morning till night. This makes the market
dull. The same condition exists in Eggs, and
while quotations are maintained the marki t
is visibly slower than during the past few
days. The situation in Cheese remains as
before.

change of life we know of no better
medicine than Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound. Here is an
illustration. Mrs. Mary L. Koehne, 371
Garfield Avenue, Chicago, 111., writes:
I have used Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound for years in my family and it
never disappoints ; so when I felt that I was
nearing the change of life I commenced treat

and it did me a great deal of good. It
stopped my dizzy spells, pains In my back

for months before taking the Compound. I
feel that if it had not been fortius great med

clever interpretation.
Lloyd Lowndes as Edward Falkner,
the philanthropic but mistaken lover,
and H. McD. Spencer as Gilbert Ne

honors.
However, to quote a pretty little de
butante hext me, "If I were to choose
between Dr. Shiels and Lloyd Lowndes
for a lover, I'd choose âDr. Shiels.
Doesn't he make a fetching lover?" So
if the doctor doesn't get a bunch of

After the second act, Admiral Mc-
Calla made a tasteful little speech of
gratitude to the players and to the
house.
My! But that house - was smartâ
yes, and big and generous. If there
were any devotees of the shine not be
neath the dome, they weren't missed in
the crush.
The music was a delight, given by
Mare Island Station Band, under the
direction of Charles Grosskurth, band
master, U. S. N. A bevy of sailor lad
dies bore down upon the stage at the
end of the third act and showered
the players with flowers. The play
over, and the applause an echo, con
gratulation went out to thÂ« whole cast,
and to its clever director, Mr. Matthieu.
The amateurs had pluck, but they
called their bluff in the best of style.
And it is to be hoped that we may
hear them again.
PARISHIONERS SAY GOOD-BY
TO FATHER P. J. McQUAIDE
Members of Holy Redeemer Church
Present Their Popular Pastor
With Substantial Check.
Members of Holy Redeemer parish
crowded the hall of the church last
night to bid farewell to their popular
pastor, the Rev. Father Joseph P.
McQuaide, who has been transferred
tp Sacred Heart Church to take the
place of the late Father Hugh' L
agan. Father McQuaide has been with
Holy Redeemer parish ever since it
was instituted and has earned the love
of every man, woman and child in it.
Though the gathering last night
was on short notice, the hall was
packed with people eager to shake
their beloved pastor's hand and to bid
him godspeed. Every society connect
ed with the church gave him some
gift to remember it by. In behalf of
the entire parish Father Moran, as
sistant pastor, handed Father Mc-
Quaide an envelope containing a sub
stantial check. When Father Mc-
Quaide attempted to express his ap
preciation emotion overcame him and
he could say little. He shook every
one of his parishioners by the hand
and gave them his blessing. They in
turn wished him as great success in
his new work as he had achieved at
Holy Redeemer parish.

locket, valued at $35, had been stclen from his
vest pocket. He had no idea of the identity of
the thief.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, JANUARY 27, 1905.
Performance Clever,
Finished and Well-
Staged,
MANY GUESTS
ARE ARRIVING
AT CORONADO
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HOTEL DEL CORONADO, Jan. 26.â
The third of the winter series of water
polo games will be played to-morrow
evening in the swimming pool. The
Coronado and San Diego teams will be
the contestants. They will also engage
in a relay race for a token offered by
the hotel management.
The Ramona, which is said to be the
finest ferry-boat of her kind in the
country, has been put back on the run
between here and San Diego. She was
built for the Spreckels Transportation
Company two years ago at a cost of
$75,000. Recently $10,000 more was ex
pended in Improvements on the steam
er. Awnings have been placed over the
upper deck, and there is little doubt
that the boat will be as great a
favorite as she was before being taken
out of the water for overhauling.
These are great days for those who
play golf, and the number on the links
each day is only limited by the number
of .caddy boys. James P. Gardner, one
of Chicago's business men, made the
nine-hole course twice around in 65,
tying the record made by John Jacob
Otter last winter. It is the best ama
teur record ever made on the Coronado
links.
Next week the spur which the Coro
nado Railroad Company is building to
the racetrack will be finished. It is to
be used only on the occasion of races,
polo games, auto races or baseball
games. It is the intention of the man
agement to make more frequent use of
the track and grounds now that the
spur makes them accessible.
Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Bridgeford of
Kansas City are here for a month.
Bridgeford is president of the Stock
yards Exchange in Kansas City and is

SMITH RETURNS
TO OLD HAUNTS
Nan Patterson's Brotlier-in
Law Arrives in Town and
Seeks for New Evidence
VISITS FRIENDS HERE
Witness in Famous Case Is
Said to Have Expressed
Belief in Girl's Innocence
J. Morgan Smith was in town. This
may not be of particular interest to
the citizen of San Francisco, but they
say that it is to the man of Gotham.
J. Morgan Smith has been out of the
focus of the New York eye for nearly
six weeks and during that time he has
been badly wanted.
Smith is the brother-in-law of Nan
Patterson, accused of the murder of
Caesar Young, well known in his life
time as a maker of racing pools and
an all around sport. It was Smith's
pistol with which the murder of Young
was supposed to have been committed
and for that reason the prosecution
looked high and low for the young
man on the Bowery, throughout the
tenderloin and in divers other neigh
borhoods that J. Morgan was wont to
affect when not actively engaged in
the business of promoting extensive
financial transactions.
Word came by wire from New York
yesterday that the metropolitan police
were still trying to trail Smith, but
that his footsteps had not been, so far
as they were concerned, visible to the
naked eye. *Some one on the Bowery
told some one else that Smith had
reached the Pacific Coast and that he
had wired "I am in Frisco" to one of
his friends. This was true, for day
before yesterday the much sought wit
ness was parading Market street and
later made his headquarters at 543
O'Farrell street, where he is acquainted
with a couple of actor folK.
Smith left the city yesterday for a
day or more and is expected back Sat
urday. He said that he was here to
look up evidence that might be of some
advantage to his sister-in-law and that
naturally he did not wish to give the
New York prosecutors anything re
garding the pistolâor anything elseâ
that might tend to strengthen the case
against the pretty chorus girl. His
testimony is important to the prosecu
tion, but he does not want to give it,
for he is said to be a firm believer in
Nan Patterson's innocence.
Smith is widely known in this city.
He has been here on many occasions
and about two years ago was a familiar
figure in the downtown district. He
left this city to follow the races on the
Eastern circuit and during the Nan
Patterson trial was called as a witness
to testify that it was his pistol that
sent Young to his-- death. He never an
swered the summons, hut left New
York for the Middle West, then for
Los Angeles and San Francisco. He
told friends that he knew nothing about
the pistol incident and that he did not
believe that the revolver was that
which was found in the cab on the
night of the fatal shooting of Young.

ONLY RUMORS,
SAYS HUTTON
Former Commissioner Has
No Evidence to Help Grand
Jury in Its Investigations
ANDREWS' VAIN EFFORT
Young Woman Makes State
ment Denying Charges on
Which the Mayor Acted
H. W. Hutton, the deposed Police Com
missioner, was busy yesterday making
denials of reports that he had Riven the
Grand Jury information of public cor
ruption calculated to create an up
heaval in the municipal government.
Foreman Andrews had excitedly sought
an interview with the ex-Commission
er after Mayor Schmitz removed him
from the commission the day before,
and while refusing to discuss the mat
ter he gave out the impression that
Hutton had made some sensational
revelations.
"I gave Foreman Andrews nothing
tangible for the Grand Jury to work
on," said Hutton last night. "He came
to me hotfoot and asked me if I could
tell him anything about 'grafting.' All
I could give him were the rumors
afloat. Had I known of any corruption
I would not have waited till he came
after it. I would have exposed it my
self.
"I told him pt being approached over
two years ago by an agent of the com
pany owning the big nickel-in-the-slot
machines in saloons with a vague offer
of $1000 a month as attorney if I would
desist from my active efforts to close
down the machines. Later another
man came to me with a more definite
proposal that I should have a retainer
of $300 a month to look after the com
pany's business.
"Andrews asked me to give the
names, of these two men but I refused
to do so. As is usual I was approached
in that careful way that leaves escape
open from criminal charge, and it
would be useless to have the matter
exploited. It is not true that I impli
cated a police captain.
"Andrews also asked me If I knew
of any fund the French restaurants
had raised to save their business,
which was threatened by the announce
ment of Commissioner Reagan and my
self that the private rooms must be
closed. I was unable to give him in
formation other than a rumor that the
restaurateurs had made up a fund of
$100,000.
"In a talk I had with Juror Bowes
to-day he pressed me for some tangi
ble evidence of corruption, but I told
him I knew of absolutely nothing that
would substantiate the rumors. There
is always a lot of talk about corrup
tion, but to prove the accusation is a
far different matter."
The following statement, signed by
the young woman who was named by
Mayor Schmitz in his charges against
the ex-Commissioner, was given out,
by Hutton: '
With respecf to the reasons given for the
removal of Police Commissioner Hutton. as far
as my name appears I have known him about
eighteen months and not three years. I was
not Iff short dresses when I first met him, nor
tiid he pay for my board and lodging In an
assignation house. No medical attendance has
been necessary' for me since I have known him
other than for slight ailments. At one time I
thought my lungs were affected.
Mr. Hutton has never paid for any medical
attendance for me.
About all of the other things said about me
are not true. I have been to theaters and to
dinner with him and to his house alone- and
with others. He has always acted as a gen
tleman should when I have been with him
and nothing out of the way has efer occurred
between us or been suggested by Tdr. Hutton.
Hutton was subpenaed yesterday to
appear before the Police Commission to
night as a witness against the ser
geants and patrolmen whom he ac
cused of being participants in corrup
tion in Chinatown.

Buck's stoves and ranges have been handed downâand found true.
Isn't that a record to be proud of? Here is a question that will appeal
to your common-sense reasoning. If Buck's stoves and ranges were
not EVERYTHING that is claimed for them, would not the buying
public have discovered it long ago? Could they have become the most
popular in the world if they did not more than please?
Buck's stoves and ranges have been on the market for more than
57 years now, and NO line has so many pleased and enthusiastic friends.
You eliminate all doubtâyou take no chances at allâyou are absolutely
stove safe when you buy a Buck's. You have not only the factory
guarantee, but our own personal guarantee, that they are the most all
round satisfactory and the most fairly priced line of stoves and ranges
offered for sale to-day. We would like to show you how attractive in
appearance they are, and to explain to you their dozen and one points
of superiority.

Aigeltinger piloted the party to Mar
ket and O'Farrell streets and initiated
the members into the odors that
emanate from the kitchen of a restau
rant in the Phelan building, which is
directly under the sidewalk. Aigel
tinger said that if the Grand Jury
did not take action to abate what he
considers a nuisance from the bad
odors the Board of Works would do
bo. He suggested that the kitchen be
moved away from under ihe sidewalk
and a vent pipe installed to carry off
the- odors. Tharp was instructed to
submit plans on the change to the
Grand Jury.

DESERTED WIFE
LOSES SIGHT
Bed-Bidden Mother of Five
Is Stricken Blind and Be
comes Insane From Grief
For nearly a week Aye children, all
under ten years of age, have been try
ing to take care of a mother bedridden
and nearly demented by grief and wor
ry at the desertion of her husband, Os
car Ohlson. Yesterday the woman sud
denly became blind and lost her reason
altogether.
The unhappy mother and the help
less little ones have been living In a
wretched tenement at 21 Clara street.
Since the desertion of Ohlson only such
scraps of food as neighbors could spare
came into the Ohlson home. The few
miserable sticks of furniture that the
family once possessed were sold to buy
bread. Very few loaves could be bought
with the proceeds.
The culmination of the helpless fami
ly's misery came yesterday. Mrs. Ohl
son gave way to despair and began to
shriek wildly. "Where are you? Oh/
children, where are you?" she cried.
"I can't see you any more."
'Hearing the voices of the little ones,
the mother attempted to move toward
them, holding her arms outstretched
after the manner of those who walk In
darkness. She staggered and fell to
the floor, still crying, "Where are you?
I cannot see you." She had been
stricken hlind.
For a while the children huddled in a
corner, terrified at the wild cries of
their mother. The eldest boy, Oscar,
9 years old, approached her timidly and
touched her on the shoulder.
"I can't see, I can't see," she moaned.
"Don't you know me, mamma?" he
asked.
"I can't see, I can't see," she mut
tered stupidly.
The boy ran out of the house and told
*nis story to Policeman Ryan, who at
once summoned an ambulance and had
the woman taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where she will be held
pending investigation as to her sanity.
The children were taken in charge by
the Society for the Prevention of Cruel
ty to Children.
Policeman Ryan says that the condi
tion of the children was pitiful when he
found them. * They were huddled In a
corner like a group of gaunt little spec
tres, watching their stricken mother
with terror and grief.
The police are looking for the father.
