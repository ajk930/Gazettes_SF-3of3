THE last of the scries of twelve lessons, in
this simple method of music is presented
to-day. The keys which these charts in
terpret are D flat and B flat minor. Both
of these keys are difficult to master, be
cause of the large number of flats, but the charts
makq them simple and easy to learn. The lower
chart on this page gives the chords of the key of
D flat, while the chords of its relative, the key of
B flat minor, are given on the upper chart. The
top, middle and lower sections of each chart give
the three chords of each key, and these are all
sufficient for accompaniments. No other knowl
edge is required to play in perfect harmony. Th
colored letters arc to be played with the left hand
and the black letters with the right hand.
Having placed the chart on the piano, play
the colored letter on the top section with the left
hand, and then the three black letters in unison
with the right hand. "Next play the middle section
in the same way. Then the lower section and
then return to the top section. The small letter
D with a dash above it, which gives the chart
position, must not be played. After a brief prac
tice these chords can be memorized and you may
play without the use of the chart. But with the
chart a person who never struck a note on the
piano before may in a few mu|utes play the har
monious chords correctly, ana then accompany
his or her own songs or the songs of friends.
' Proficiency requires a little practice, but no
previous knowledge of music.
If you 4iave followed these twelve lessons
closely you have acquired the best possible basis
for a thorough musical education. A knowledge
of the keys and their chords underlies all the
triumphs of the accomplished musician.The Brethren.

*">V N hour later the captain Abdul
/ I tab might have been Â«sen walk-.
f I ir;g carelessly tbv.ai\ the tent
*â¢ I where the brethren slept. Also.
had there" been any who cared
to watch something else might iiave
been t:een in that low moonlight; for
'now th<* storm and the heavy rain
" which followed it had passed. Name
ly, the ': 1 shape of the eunuch Mes
rour, slipping: after him vraimed in
a dark camel-hair cloak, such as
was commonly worn by camp fol
lowers, and taking shelter cunningly
behind every rock ami s-hrub and
rise of the ground. Hidden among
some picketed dromedaries, he saw
Abdullah enter the tent of the brethren,
then, wailing: till a cloud crossed the
moon. Mesrour ran to it unseen, and/
throwing him* elf down on its shadowed
side, lay there like a drunken man, and
listened with all his ears. But the
thick canvas was heavy with wet, nor
would the ropes and the; trench that
â¢was dug around permit him. who did
not love to lie in the water, to place
his head against it. Also those within
spoke low. and he could only hear
single words, such as "garden," "the
Â«tar," "Princess."
So important did these =eem to him,
however, that at length Mesrour crept
xinder the cords, and although he shud
dered at its cold, drew his body into
the trench of water, and with the sharp
point of his knife cut a little slit in
the taut canvas. To this he set his'
eye, only to find that it served him
nothing, for there 'was no light in the
tent. Still, men were there who talked
in the darkness.
"Good," said a voice â it was that of '
one of the brethren, but which he could
not tell, for even to those who knew
them best they seemed to. be the same.
"Good; then it is settled. To-morrow at
. the hour arranged you bring the Prin
cess to the place agreed upon, disguised
as you have said. In payment for this
sen-ice 1 hand you the Luck of Hassan,
which you covet. Take it â here it â
and swear to do your part, since other
wise it will bring no luck to you, for I
â will kill you the first time v. 0 meet
yes, and the other also."
"I swear it by Allah and his proph
et," answered Abdullah in a hoarse,
trembling voice.
"It is enough; sec that you keep the
oath. And row away; it is not safe that
you shall tarry here;"
Then came the sound of a man leav
ing the tent. Parsing round it cautious
ly, he halted, and opening his hand
looked at its contents to make sure that
no tri<.k had been played upon him Jn
.the darkness. Mesrour screwed his
head round to look also, and saw the
light gleam faintly on the surface of
the splendid jewel, wliich he 100 desired
so eagerly, in so doing his foot ruck
a 6tcne. and instantly Abdullah glanced
down, to see a dead or drunken man
lying almost at his feet. With a. swift
movement he hid the jewel, and started
to walk away. Then, bethinking him
that it would be wall to make sure that
this fellow was dead or sleeping, he
turned and kicked the prostrate Mes
rour upon the back, and with all his
Etrenglh. Indeed, he did this thrice,
putt; the eunuch to .the greatest
- agony.
"I thought I saw him move," Abdul
lsJl muttered after the third kick: "it
Is beat to make sure," and he drew his
knife.
Now. had not terror paralyzed him
Mesrour would have cried out, but,
fortunately for himself, before he found
his voice Abdullah had buried the knife
three inches deep in his fat thigh. With
an effort ,he 'â¢>{â '.â  this also, knowing
that if be showed signs of life the next
stroke would he to his heart. Then, sat
isfied that this fellow, whoever he
might i!?, \vr_s either a corpse or in
Â«ensil>3.\ Abdullah drew. out the knife,
â¢wiped it en his victim's robe and de
par'
Not long afterward Mesrour departed
also, toward the Sultan's house, bel
lowing with rage and pain and vowing
vengeance. â¢
It was net long delayed.'
That very night Abdullah was
seized and put to the question. In his â 
suffering he confessed that- he had
been to the tent of the brethren and
received from one of them the jewel
which was found upon him, as a bribe
to bring the Princess to a certain gar
den outside the camp. But he named
the wrong garden. Further, when they
asked which of th? brethren it was
â who bribed him, he said he did not
know, as their voices were. alike, and'
their tent was in darkness; moreover,
that he beUeved there was ; soil one
roan In it â at least he heard or saw no
other. He added that fie was sum
moned to the tent by . an Arab man
whom he had never seen before, but
who told him that if he. wished for
â what he most desired and good for
tune, he was to be there at a certain
hour after sunset. Then he fainted,
and was - put back in prison till : the
morning by th' command of Saladin.
When the morning came Abdullah
was dead, who desired .no more tor
ments with doom at the end of them,
having made shift to strangle himself
with his robe. But .first he had'
scrawled upon the wall with a piece of
charcoal:
* **May that accursed Star of Hassan
which tempted me bring better luck to
others, and may hell â â  receive the soul
of Mesrour." "::, ; â 
â¢ Thus died Abdullah, as faithful as he
could be in such 'sore straits, since he
had betrayed neither Masouda nor his
son, both of whom ; were In the plot,
and said that only oa'c.of the brethren
â was present in the tent;'.. whereas', he;
knew well that the two of them "were"
there and ., which of these spoke and
Cave him the . jewel.
Very early that morning the breth
- '
t
ren, who were lying wakeful, o heard
sounds without their. tent, and looking
out saw that it was suÂ«rounded by
Mamelukes. â  /
"The riot is discovered," said God
win to Wu'f quietly, but with despair
in his face. "Now, my brother, admit l
nothing, even under torture, lest others
perish with us." â  ... 0
"Shan we fight?" asked "Wulf as they
threw on" their mail. . â¢' .â¢
Hut Godwin answered: .
"Nay.it would serve us. nothing."
Then*an officer entered the tent, and
commanded them to give up their
swords and to follow him to Saladin to
au.iv.cr a charge- that had. been; laid
against thorn both, nor.wdiald he say
aÂ»iy tt.oip. So they went as prisoners.
and after waiting. awhile were ushered
into a â¢â¢-c room of the . house where
Saladin lodged, which was arranged as
n court with a dais at one end. Before
this they \rere stood, till presently
the Sultan entered through the further
door, and with him.* certain of his
emirs and secretaries. ;.i?n Rosamund,
.who looked very pale, was brought?
there, and in attendance on her Ma-,
souda. oalm-faced as- ever.
Thj? brethren bowed to them, but Sa
ladin. whose eyes were full of , rage,
took r.o notice of their salutation. For
a moment there was ellence, then Sa- .
ladtr bade a secretary read the charge,
which was brief. It was that they had
conspired to steal away the Princess of
Baal bee. . Â»
"Where is the evidence against us?"
asked Godwin boldly. "The Sultan is
just, and convicts no man save on tes
timony." . % â¢ -
Again Saladin motioned to the secre
tary, who read the words that had been
taken down from the lips of J.he cap
tive Abdullah. They demanded to be
j allowed to examine the captive Ab
dullah, and learned, that he was al
ready dead. Then the eunuch Mesrour
was carried forward, for walk he could
not, owing to the wound that Abdullah
had given him. and told all his tale,
how he had suspected Abdullah, and.
following him, had heard him and one
of the brethren speaking in the tent,
and the words that passed, and after
ward seen Abdullah with the jewel
in bis hand.
When he had finished Godwin asked
which of them he had heard speaking
with Abdullah, and he answered that
he could not say. as their voices .were
Bo alike, but one voice only had spoken.
Then Rosamund was ordered to give
her testimony, and said, truly enough.
that, she knew nothing of the plot and
had no! thought of this flight. Masouda
also ore that she now heard of it for
the first time. After this the secretary
announced that there was no more evi
dence, and prayed of the Sultan to give
judgment in the matter." * '* ' '"
"Against which of us." asked God
win, "seeing that both the dead and the
living witness declared they heard but
one voice, and whose that voice : was
they did not know? According to your
own law, you cannot condemn a man
against whom there is no good testi
mony." . -/....â 
"Which of us. then, is to die, and
which to go free?" asked Godwin.
"Tell us, that he who is doomed may
prepare his soul."
"Say you, who know the truth,"
answered Saladin. ' â¦
"We admit nothing," said Godwin;
"yet if one of as must die, I as the
older claim that right-" m *. â¢
"And 1 claim it as the younger. The
jewel was Hassan's gift to me: who
eleo could give it to Abdullah?" said
Wu'f. speaking!, for the 'first time,'
whereat all the Saracens there assem
bled, brave men who loved a knightly
(ited. murmured in admiration, and .
even Saladin said:
"Weil spoken, both of you. So it
stems that both must die." â¢â ..'.
Then Rosamund stepped forward and
threw herself upon her knees before
him. exclaiming:
"Sire, my uncle,. such is not your jus
tice, that two should be slain for the
offense of one. if offense there be. ' If
you know not which is guilty, spare
them both, I beseech you."
He stretched out his hand and raised
her from her knees, then thought a
while and said: *
. "Nay, plead not with me, for y how
ever much you love him the guilty man
must die, as he deserves. But of this
matter Allah alone knows the truth,
therefore let. it be decided by Allah."
and he rested his head upon his hand,
looking at Wulf and Godwin as though
to read their souls. /
Now. behind Â©iadin stood that old
and famous Iraaum who had been with
him and Hassan' when 'he: commanded ,
the brethren to depart from Damascus, .
who ail this while " had listened Jto
everything that had passed with a sour
smile. Leaning forward, he whispered
in liis master's ear. who considered &
moment then 'answered him:
"It is good. Do so." ;â _
So the imaum left the court, and re
turned presently carrying, two small
boxes of sandalwood tied with silk and
sealed, so like each other that none
could tell them apart, which boxes he
passed continually from his right hand
to his left and from his left hand to his
right, then gave them to Saladin. : . * â 'â¢â¢ :-'-'
"In one of these," said the Sultan, "is
that . jewel - known as â  the â  Enchanted -
Star and the Luck of the House of Has
san, which he ' Prince presented ito his
conqueror on the day "of Hattln and for
the dejire of which my; captain Abdul
lah became! a traitor and was * brought
to death. In the other is a stone of -, the
same weight.' Come,' my niece, take you
these boxes and "give them 'to your
kinsmen, to each the box you will. The
Jewel that is called the Star of Hassan 1
is magical and has virtue, so" they say.
Let it choose; therefore, which of these
knights is . ripe * for death, , and ; let f him
perish in whose box the Star is" found."
"Now,",' muttered the imaum; into the
. ear of his master, ; "now at length we -
shall learn which it is of these two men
. that the lady loves." 'â¢ - .
â¢ "That Is what a 1 seek' to know," an
â  swered Saladin in the same low voice.
. As . she : heard this decree ;-â  Rosamund
looked round wildly, and pleaded: l .'â¢ '-'
"Oh! not so cruel. . I beseech you"
spare me this 'task. .Let it be another
hand that is chosen to deal death to
one of those 'i of my own blood with
.whom I have dwelt since childhood.' Let
' me not be 'the blind sword of fate 'that 1 :
i frees his spirit; lest it should ; haunt
.my dreams and : turn * all ; my , world r to >
woe. Spare me, I beseech you."
But Saladin' looked at her very stern
ly and answered:". Â ...'â¢"'
Â«;. - . "Princess/- you : '- know .why I have â '
brought you to v. the' East and raised ;
â '. you to great honor here, why also I
have made" you my companion in these <
\ \rars. . ;' it its â ', for my dream's < sake, the
; dream ?â¢_ which 3 told jme that !by some
noble act of yours you should ' save ! the â¢
: lives of thousands. Yet I am sure that
â¢

Haggard
you desire to escape, and plots are
made to take you from me. though of
these plots you say that you and your
woman" â and he looked darkly at Ma
souda â "knew nothine. But these men
know, and it is right for you, for whose
sake if not by whose command tho
thing was done, should mete out its
reward. ar,<! that the blood of him
whom you appoint, which la split for
you. uhould be on your and no other
head. Now do my bidding."
For a moment Rosamund stared at
the boxes, th<-!i suddenly she closed her
eyes, and taking thorn up at hazard,
stretched out her arms, leaning for
ward over the ed je of the dais. There
on, calmly enough the brethren took,
each of them, the box that was near
est to him, that in Rosamund's loft?
hand falling to Godwin and that in her
right to Wulf. Then she opened her
eyes again, stood still, and watched.
"Cousin," said Godwin, "before we
break this cord that is our chain .of
doom, know well that, whatever
chances, we blame you not at all. It is
God who acts through you, and you are
as innocent of the death of either of us
as of that plot whereof we stand ac
cused."
Then he began to unknot the ?ilk
that was bound about his box. Wulf,
knowing that it would tell all the tale,
did not trouble himself as yet, but
looked around the room, thinking that,
whether he lived or died, never would
he see a stranger sight. Every eye in
it was fixed upon the box in Godwin's
hand; even Saladin stared as though it
held his own destiny. No; not every
one, for those of the old imaum were
fixed upon the face of Rosamund,
which was piteous to see, for all its
beauty had left it, and even her part
ed lips were ashy. Masouda alone still
stood upright and unmoved, as though
she watched some play, but he noted
that her rich-hued cheek grew pale and
that beneath her robe her hand was
pressed upon her heart. The silence
also was intense, and.broken only by
the little grating nofse of Godwin's
fingers, as, having no knife to cut it,
he patiently untied the silk.
"Trouble enough about one man's life
in a land where lives are cheap!" ex
claimed Wulf, thinking aloud, and at
the sound of hi^volce all men started.
as though it had thundered suddenly
in a summer sky. Then with a laugh
he tore the silk about his box asunder
wtyh his strong fingers, and breakincr
the seal, shook out its contents. Lo!
there on the floor before him, gleaming
green and white with emerald and dia
mond, lay the enchanted Star of Has
san.
Masouda saw. and the color crept
back to her cheek. Rosamund saw
also, and nature was too strons: for
her, and in one bitter cry the truth
broke from her lips at last:
"Not Wulf! Not Wulf!" she wailed.

and sank buck senseless into Ma-,
souda's arm?.
"Now, Blre," said the o'.d imaum wiili
a chuckle, "you know which of those
two the Jady loves. Being a woman, as
usual she chooses badly, for the other
has the liner spirit."
"Yes, I know now," said Saladin.
"and I am glad to know, for the mat
ter has vexed me much."
But Wulf, who had puled for a mo
ment, flushed with joy as the truth
came home to him, und he understood
t.he end of all their doubts.
â¢'The Star is well named 'The Luck.' "
he said, a^s bending /down he took it
fr.om the floor and fastened it to his
cloak above his heart, "nor do I hold it
dearly earned." Then he turned to his
brother, who stood by him white and
still, baying:
"Forgive me, Godwin, but such is
the fortune of rove and war. Grudge
it not to me. f6r when I am sped to
night the luck â and all that hangs to
it â will be jours."
So that strange scene ended.
The afternoon drew toward evening,
and Godwin stood before Saladin in
his private chamber.
"What peek you now?" said the Sul
tan sternly.
"A boon," anftwered Godwin. "My
brother is doomed to die before night
fall. I ask to die instead of him."
"Why, Sir Godwin?"
"For two reasons, sire*. As you
learned to-day," at length, the rrddle
k- answered. It is Wulf who is be
loved of the Lady Rosamund, and
therefore to kill him would be a crime.
Further it is I and not he whom the
eunuch heard bargaining with the cap
t:.in. Abdullah, in the tent â I swear it.
Take your % r engeance upon me and let
him so to fulfil! his fate."
Saladin pulled at his beard, then an
swered :
"If this is to be so, time is short.
Sir Godwin. What farewells have you
to muke? You would speak with my
mccc. Rosamund? Nay, The Princess
you shall not see, and indeed cannot,
for she lies swooning in her chamber.

A while passed, and Godwin, .hearing
the sweep- of robes, looked Jup and ' saw

the shadow was so deep that the torch

She heard ; and stretched out her
arms,*; and, ' none i forbidding . him. ' God
win" walked to where she: stood."" With
out-lifting- her veil: she bent forward
and kissed him, first upon the brow
and next upon the lips; then with a
low, moaning very,"v cry," she turned and fled
from that gloomy place, nor did Sala-"
din seek to stay her. Only to himself
the Sultan wondered how it came about
that if It was Wulf she loved, she still
kiEs-ed Godwin i thus upon the lldsU^!^
As he walked back to the death-place
Godwin wondered also, "first that Rosa
mund should have spoken no single
word, and secondly because I she had
kiÂ»Fed him thus, even in that hour.
Why or wherefore he did not know, bur
there arose*. in' his: mind a memory of
: that wild ride down the mountain side'
at Beirut, and of lips which then had
touched his cheek, and, of the odor of
hair that then was blown about his
breast. : "With . a . sigh, he thrust th;Â»
thought aside/, blushing to think .that,
such memories should come. to him -who
had done with earth and Us delights,
knelt down. before Jhe headsman, and.
turning to the bishop, said: ' .V '' /
'.Bless--' me. father, and bid . them
strike."
Then it was that he heard a well
known footstep, and looked ud to see
Wulf starfng .at him.
"What do you here?" he asked. "Ha.-?
yonder fox snared both of us?" And hfl
nodded at Saladin.
"Let the fox speak." said the Sultan
with a smile. "Know. Sir Wulf, that
your brother fcvas anout to die tn your
place, dnd of his own wish. But I
refuse such sacrifice who yet have
nirfde use of it to teach my niece the
Prtneees ihat should she continue In
her plotting;? to escape, or allow you
to continue in them, certainly it will
.bring you to your deaths, und. if need
be, her a'to. Knights, you are brave
men whom I prefer to kill In war.
Good horses stand without; tukfl them
SJ my gilt, and ride with these foolish
citizens of Jerusalem. We may meet
again within its streets. Nay, thank
me not. I thank you who have taught
Salah-ed-din how per/ect a thing can
he the love of brothers."
The brethren stood a While be
wildered, for it is v strange thing thus
to come back from death to lie. Each
of them had made sure that he must
die within some few miriute.i. and pass
through the blackness which walls
man in, to find he knew not what. And
now, behold! the road that led 1 to that
blackness turned again at its very
edge, and ran forward through the fa
miliar things of earth to 3ome end un
known. They were brava, both of
them, and accustomed to face death
ciaily. as In such a place and time all
men must be; moreover, they had
been shriven, and looked to see the
gates pf paradise open on their new
born sight.
Yet, since no man loves that jour
ney, it was very sweet to know it done
with for a while, and that they stilT
might hope to dwell upon this eurth
for many years. Little wonder, then,
that their brains swam, and their eyes
grew dim, a.s they passed from the
shadow to the light again. It was
Wulf who spoke the first.
"A noble deed. Godwin, yet one for
which I should not have thanked you
had it been accomplished, who then
must have lived on by grace of your
sacrifice. Sultan, we are grateful for
your boon of life, though had you
shed this innocent blood surely it
must have stained your soul. Hay we
bid farewell to our cousin Rosamund
before we ride?"
" Nay." answered Sakidin: "Sir God
win his done that already â let it serve
for both. To-morrow she shall learn
the truth of the story. Now go, and
return ne more."
'That must be as fate wills," an
swrred Godwin, an^l they bowed and
went.
Outside that gloomy place of death
their swords were given them, and two
good horses, which they mounted.
Honce guides led them to the embassy
from Jerusalem that was already in
the saddle, who were very glad to wel
come two such knights :n their com
pany. Then, having bid farewell to th?
bishop Egbert, who wept for Joy at
their escape, escorted fo- awhile by
Si.ladin'3 soldiers, they rode away
from Ascalon at the fall of night.
Soon they had told each other all
there was to tell. When he heard cf
the woe of Rosamund Wulf well-nigh
shed tears.
â We have our lives," he said, "but
how shall we save her? While Ma
souda stayed with her there was some
h< pc, but now I can see none."
"There !s none, except in God," an
swered Godwin, "who can do all things
âeven free Rosamund and make her
your wife. Also, if Masouda is at lib
erty, we shall hear from her ere longâ
s-j let us keep a good heart. "
But though he spoke thus, the soul
of Godwin was oppressec with a fear
which he could not understand. It
seemed as though soms great terror
1 was very close to him, or to one who
v. as near and dear. Deeper and deeper
he sank into the pit of dread of he
knew not what, until at length he could
â¢ have cried aloud, and his brow was
Lathed with a sweat of anguish. Wulf
saw his face in the moonlight, and
asked:
"What ails you, Godwin? Have you
some secret wound?"
"Aye, brother," he answered, "a
wound in my spirit. 11l fortune threat
ens usâ great ill fortune.''
"That is no new thing*," said Wulf.
"in this land of blood and sorrows. Let
us .meet 'it, as we have me: the rest." .'
â¢; "Alas! brother,"' exclaimed Godwin.
"I fear.' that' Ros&Bnuwi 13 in sore dan- r

"since we cannot, let us pray that some
â¢ angel. may deliver her." : â 
", "Aye." said ' Godwin, and as they rod
through : the desert sands I beneath the

CHAPTER XXI.
What Befell r Godwin. J
. At the village of Bittir, , "some sevan
miles from Jerusalem,: the embassy dis
mounted - to ; rest, ; then again they _
''pressed forward down-the valley iÂ» the
hope of reaching the Zion Gate
the midday heat was upon Â» them. At
1 th- . end of tbis valley swelled â -, the
shoulder of â¢<*. .hill whence the eye could
' command its length, and on the crest
of that shoulder -appeared -suddenly, a
man and a woman, seated on beautiful
horses. The cornpan:: halted, * fearing
le3t these -might herald seme attack
and that the woman was a man dis
guised to -deceive them. "While they
waited thus Irresolute. â¢â  the pair upon
the hill turned their horses' heads anil
notwithstanding its steepness began to
gallop toward them very swrftly. . -.Wulr
looked at them curiously and. said to
Godwin: . â  -.."' ~. .â  .<â  - *>*â  â Â»â¢
"Now I am. put In mind of a certain

Almost "as he finished speaking the *â¢
strangers pulled up their steeds in,front ( r
of the company, -to whom the man

" saw his face and knew him at once as '
the old Arab : called Son of ' the Sand, l

' ! Godwin gave a sigh of relief. If Ma
souda had i appointed to meet her uncle.;-;
;. the Arab, a least she must be â  safe. So' it was no voice of hers which seemed
to whisper his name in the darkness of
the night when terror had a hold of
him â terror, born perhaps of all that he
had endured and the shadow of death
through which he had so lately passed.
Then he locked up, to find Wulf staring
back at the woman behind him, and
reproved him, saying that he must keep
to the spirit of the bargain as well as
to the letter, and that if he might not
speak he must not look either.
"That is a pity, " answered Wulf. "for
though she Is so tied up she must be a
tall and noble lady from the way she
sits her horse. The horse, too. is noble,
own cousin or brother to Smoke, I
think. Perhaps she will sell it when
we reach Jerusalem."
Then they rode on. and because they
thought their honor in it neither spoke
nor locked more at the companion of
this adventure, though, had they known
â¢it, she looked hard enough at them.
At length they reached the gate of
Jerusalem, which was crowded with
folk awaiting the return of their em
bassadors. They all passed through,
and the embassy was escorted thence
by the chif*f people, most of the multi
tude following them to know if they
brought pence or war. Now Godwin
and Wulf stared at each other, wonder
ing whither they were to go and where
to find the relatives of their veiled
companion, of whom they saw nothing.
Out of the street opened an archway,
and beyond this archway was a garden,
which seemed to be deserted. They
rede into it to take counsel and their
companion followed, but, as always, a
little behind them.
"Jerusalem is reached, and we must
peak to her now," said Wulf. "If only
to ask her whither she wishes to be
taken."
Godwin nodded, and they wheeled
their horses round.
"Lady," he saÂ«d in Arabic, "we have
fulfilled our charge. Be pleased to tell
us where are those relatives to whom
, "we must lead you."
"Here." answered a soft voice.
They stared about the deserted ear
den in which stones and sacks of earth
had been stored ready for a siege, and
finding no one. said:
"We see them not."
â  Then the lady let slip her cloak,
though not her veil, revealing the robe
beneath.
"By St. Peter!" said Godwin. "I
know the broidery on that dress. Ma
souda! Say, is it you. Masouda?"
As he spoke the veil fell also, and le".
before them was a woman like to Ma-
Eouda and yet not Masouda. The hair
was dressed like hers; the ornaments
and the necklace made of the claw's of
the lion which Godwin killed were hers:
the skin was of the same rich hue:
there even was the tiny mole upon her
cheek, but as the head was bent they
could not see her eyes. Suddenly, with
a little moan she lifted it, and looked at
them.
"Rosamund! It is Rosamund her
eelf!" gasped Wulf. "Rosamund dis
guised as Masouda!" And he fell
rather than leapt from his saddle and
ran to her, murmuring, "God! I thank
thee!"
Now she seemed to faint and slid
from her horse into his arms, and lav
there a moment while Godwin turned
asJde his head.
"Yes," she said, freeing herself, "it
is I and no other, yet I rode with you
all this way and neither of you knew
me."
"Have we eyes that can pierce veils
and woolen garments?" asked Wulf in
dignantly; but Godwin said in a
strange, strained voice:
"You are Rosamund disguised. as
Masouda. Who. then, was the wom
an to whom I bade farewell before
Saladin while the headsman awaited
me: a. veiled woman who wore the
robes and gems of Rosamund?"
"1 know not. Godwin." she an
' swerpd, * unless it were Masouda clad
in my garments as I left her. Nor
do I know anything of this story of
the "headsman who awaited you. " ' I
thought â I thought it was for Wulf
that he waited â oh! Heaven, I
thought that."
"Tell us your tale." said Godwin
hoarsely.
"It is short," she answered. "After
the casting of the lot, of which I shall
dream till my death-day, I fainted.
"When I found my senses again I
thought that I must be mad. for there
before me stood a woman dressed in
jny garments, whose face seemed like
my face, . >-! not the same.
"'Have no fear,' she said; 'I am
Masouda who have learned how to
play a part. Listen, there is no time
to lose. 1 have been ordered to leave
; the camp; . â â¢ -;â¢ now my uncle the
: Arab waits without, with two swift
â¢ horses. You, lady, will leave la my
place. Look, you wear my robes and
my face â almost; and are of my
height, and the -man who guides you
will know no difference. I have seen
to that, for although a soldier of
Salah-ed-din, he is of my tribe. I will
go with you to the door and there bid
you farewell before the eunuchs and
the guards with weeping, and who
will guess that Masouda is the Prin
cess of Baalbec and that the Princess
of Baalbec is Masouda?'
" 'And whither shall I go?' I asked.
" "My uncle. Son of the Sand, will
give you over to the embassy that
rides to Jerusalem, or falling that, will
take you to the city, or failing that
will hide you in the mountains among
his own people. See. here Is a letter
that he must read; I place it in your
breast.*
"Yes," said Godwin, "but where is
Masouda, and what will happen to her
who has dared to venture such a plot
as this? Oh! know you what this
woman did? I was condemned to die
in place pf Wulfâ how, it matters not:
you will learn it afterwardâ and thÂ«
Princess of Baalbec was brought to
say me '-farewell. There, v under the
very eyes of Saladin, Masouda played
tier part and mimicked you so well that
*Âihe Sultan was deceived, and I, even I,
" was deceived. Yes, when for the first
and last time I embraced her, I was
deceived, although, it is true, I won
dered. Also since then a great fear
has been with me, although here again
I was deceived, for I thought 1 feared
â for you. Now, hark you, Wulf; take
Rosamund And lodge her with some
lady in this city, or, better still, place
her ;. sanctuary with the nuns of the
Holy Cross, whence none will dare to
drag her, and let her don their habit.
The abbess may remember you, for we
have met her, and at least she will not
refuse Rosamund a refuge."
"Yes. yes: I mind me she asked us
news of folk in England. But you?
Where do you go, Godwin?" said his
brother.
"I? I ride back to Ascalon to find
Masouda."
. â¢ â¢ â¢
So they rode on through the narrow
Etreets that were crowded with scared
l>eople, for now the news was ; spread
that the embassy had rejected the
terms of Saladin. He had offered to
give the city food and to suffer its in
habitants to fortify ' the walls, and to
hold them till the following Whitsun
tide, if, rhould no help reach them.they
would swear to surrender then. But
they had answered that â¢while they had
life they would never abandon the
place where their God had died.
So now war was before fhem â war to
the end: and who were they that must
bear Its brunt? Their leaders were
slain or captive, their King a prisoner,
their sc-ldiers skeletons on the field of
Hattin. Only the women and ehilden,
the sick, the old, and the wounded re
mained â perhaps eighty thousand souls
in allâ but few of whom could bear
arms. Yet these few, must defend Je
rusalem against the might of the vic
torious Saracen. . Little wonder that
they wailed in the streets till - the cry
of their despair went up to heaven, for
In their hearts all . of ; them knew that
the holy place was doomed and their
lives were forfdted/JSgggggraÃÃ?!
Pushing their path through' this sad
multitude, who took little note of them,
at length they came to the . nun
nery on the sacred Via Dolorosa,
which Wulf had seer, when God
win and. he were In Jerusalem
after they had been dismissed' by
Saladin from Damascus. Its door
stood in the shadow of that arch where
the Roman Pilate had uttered to all
generations the words "Behold the
man!" Here the porter told him that
the nuns were at prayer in their chapel.
Wulf replied that he must see the lady
abbess upon a matter that would not
delay, and they were shown into a cool
and lofty room. Presently the door
opetied and through it came the abbess
in her white robesâ a tall and stately
English woman, of middle age, who
looked at them curiously.
"Lady Abbess," said Wulf, bowing
low, "my name is Wulf d'Arcy. Do
you remember me?"
"Yes. We met In Jerusalem, before
the battle of Hattin," she answered.
"Also, I know something of your story
in this landâ a very strange one."
"This lady," went on Wulf, "is the
daughter and heiress of Sir Andrew
d'Arcy, my dead uncle, and in Syria
the Princess of Baalbec and the niece
of Saladin."
The abbess started, and asked:
"Is she, then, of their accursed faith,
as her garb would seem to show?"
. "Nay, mother," said Rosamund, "I
am a Christian, if a sinful one, and I
come here to seek sanctuary, lest when
they know who I am and he clamors
at their gates, my fellow Christians
may surrender me to my uncle, the
Sultan."
â¢â¢Tell me the story," said the abbess;
and they told her briefly, while she
listened amazed. When they had fin
ished, she said:
"Alas! my daughter, ho.v can we
pave you whose own lives are at stake?
That belongs to God alone. Still, what
we can we will do gladly, and here, at
least, you may rest for some short
while. At the most holy altar of our
chapel you shall be given sanctuary,
after which no Christian man dare lay
a hand upon you, since * â¢> do so is a
sacrilege that would cost him his soul.
Moreover, I counsel that you be en
rolled up' â  our books as a novice, and '
don our garb. Nay." she added with a
smile, noting he look of alarm on the
face of Wulf. "the lady Rosamund need
not wear it always, unless sue should
be her wish. Not every novice proceeds
to the final vows." j
"Long have I; been decked in gold
embroidered silks^and priceless gems,"
answered Rosamund, V'and now I seem
to desire that while robe yours more
than anything on earth.".
So hey led Rosamund to the chapel,
and in sight of all their order and of
priests who had Â»been summoned, at
the altar there, upon that holy spot
where they said that once Christ had
answered Pilate, they placed her hand
and gave her sanctuary, - and threw
over her Bred head the white veil of a
novice. There, too, Wulf left her, and
riding away, reported himself to Ba
lian of Ibelin, the elected commander
of the city, who was glad enough to
welcome so stout a knight where
knights were few. -
â¢ â¢ â¢
Oh! weary, weary was that ride of
Godwin's beneath the sun, beneath the
stars. Behind him. the brother who
had been his companion and closest
friend, and the woman whom he had
loved in vain; and in front, he knew
not what. What went he forth to seek?
Another woman, who had risked her
life for them all because she loved him.
And if he found her, what then? Must
he wed her. and did he wish this? Nay,
he desired no woman on the earth; yet
what was right that he would do. And
if he found her not, what then? Well,
at least he would give himself up to
Saladin. who must think ill of them by
whom he had dealt well, . and tel! him
that of this plot rhey had no knowl
edge. Indeed, to him he would go first,
,if it were but to beg forgiveness for
Masouda should she still be in his
hands. Thenâ for I\p. could not hope to
be believed or pardoned a second timeâ
then let death come, and he would wel
come it, who greatly longed for peace.
It was evening and Godwin's's tired
horse stumbled slowly through the
great camp of the Saracens without
the walls of fallen Ascalon. None hin
dered him, for having been so long a
prisoner he was known by many, while
others thought that he was but one of
the surrendered Christian knights. So
he came to the great house where Sal
adin lodged, and bade the guard take
his name to the Sultan, saying that he
craved an audience of him. Presently
he was admitted and found Saladin
seated in council among his ministers.
"Sir Godwin," he said sternly, "see-
Ing how you have dealt by me, what
brings you back into my camp? I gave
your brethren your lives, and you have
robbed me of one whom I would not
lose." l â¢
"We did not rob you, sire," answered
Godwin, who knew nothing of the plot.
"Nevertheless, as I was sure that you
would think thus, I am come from
Jerusalem leaving the princess and
my brother there, to tell the truth and
to surrender myself to you, that I may
bear in her place any punishment
which you think fit to inflict upon the
woman Masouda."
Why should you bear it?" asked Sa
ladin.
"Because, Sultan." answered Godwin
sadly, and with bent head, "whatever
she did,- she did for love of me, though
without my knowledge. Tell me, is she
still here, or has she fled?" .
"She is still here," answered Saladin
shortly. "Would you wish to see her?"
Godwin breathed a sigh of relief. At
least, Masouda still lived, and the ter
ror that had struck him in the night
was but an evil dream born of his own
fears and sufferings.
"I do," he answered, "once, if no
more. I have words to say to her."
"Doubtless she will be glad to learn
how her plot prospered." said Saladin,
with a grim smile. "In truth it was
well laid and boldly executed." â¢
Calling to one of his council, that
same old imaum who had planned the
casting of the lots, the Sultan spoke
with him aside. Then he said:
"Let this knight be led to the woman
Masouda, To-morrow we will judge
him."
Taking a silver lamp from the wall,
the imaum beckoned to Godwin, who
bowed to the Sultan and followed. As
he passed wearily through the throng
In the audience room It seemed to God
win that the emirs and captains gath
ered there looked at him with pity in
their eyes. So strong was this feeling
in him that he halted in his walk and
asked:
"Tell me, lord, do I go to my death?"
i "All of us go thither," answered Sal
adin in the silence, "but Allah has not
written that death is yours to-night."
They passed down long passages;
they came to a door which the imaum,
who hobbled in front, unlocked. 7
"She Is under ward then?" said God
win. . â  . , â 
"Aye," was the answer," "under ward.
Enter," and he handed him" the lamp.
"I remain .without."
"Perchance she sleeps and I shall dis
turb her," said Godwin, as he hesitated
upon the threshold. â¢ \
"Did you not say she loved you? Then
doubtless, even if she sleeps, she, who
has dwelt at Masyaf,.will hot take your
visit ill, who have ridden so far to find
her," said the imaum with a sneering .
laugh. "Enter, I say."
. 6o Godwin took the lamp and went
in and the door was shut 5 behind - him.
Surely the '. place was familiar to . him?
He - knew that arched â¢ roof t and these
rough, stone walls. Why, it was here f
that :he : had been brought to , die and :
through that very door the false Rosa
mund had come to bid \ him farewell,
who . now returned to , greet â  her in â¢ this 1>
same darksome den. â¢ Well, it was
empty â doubtless she would soon come,
and he waited, looking at the : door.
It did not stir; he heard no footsteps;
nothing broke that utter silence. He
turned again and stared about him.
Something glinted on the ground yon
der, toward the end of the vault, just
where he had knelt before the execu
tioner. A shape lay there; doubtless it
was Masouda, imprisoned and asleep.
"Masouda," he said, and the sounding
echoes from the arched walls answered
back, "Masouda."
He must awaken her; there was no
choice. Yes, it .was she, asleep, and
she still wore the royal robes of Rosa
mund, and a clasp of Rosamund's i^ill
glittered on her breast.
How sound Masouda slept! Would
she never wake? He knelt down beside
her and put out his hand to lift the long
hair that hid her face. Now it touched
her, and lo! the head fell over.
Then, with horror in his heart. God
win held down the lamp and looked.
Oh! those robes were red, 'and those
lips were ashen. It was Masouda,
whose spirit had passed him in the
desert; Masouda slain by the heads
man's sword! This was the evil jest
that had been played upon him, and
thus they met again.
Godwin rose to his feet and stood
over her still shape as a man stands in
a dream, while words broke Ifrom his
lips and a fountain in his heart was un
sealed.
"Masouda," he whispered, "I know
now that I love you, O woman with a
royal heart. Wait for me, Masouda,
wherever you may dwell."
While the whispered words left his
lips it seemed to Godwin that once
more, as when he rode with Wulf from
Ascalon, the strange wind blew about
his brow, bringing with it the presence
of Masouda, and that once more the
unearthly peace sank Into his soul.
Then all was past and over, and he
turned to see the old imaum standing
at his side.
"Did I not tell you that you would
find her sleeping?" he said, with his
bitter, chuckling laugh. "Call on her,
Sir Knight; call on her! Love, they
say. can bridge great gulfsâ even that
between severed neck and bosom."
With the silver lamp in his hand
Godwin smote and the man went
down like a felled ox, leaving him
once more in silence and in darkness.
For a moment Godwin stood thus
till his brain was filled with fire and
he, too, fell â fell across the corpse of
Masouda, and there lay still.
CHAPTER XXII.
At Jerusalem.
Godwin knew that he lay sick, but
he knew no more, for all the past had
gone from him, save that Masouda
seemed to tend him in his sickness.
There she was always, clad in a white
robe, and looked at him with eyes
full of Ineffable calm and love, and
he noted that round her neck ran a
thin, red line, and wondered how it
came there.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
He knew that he traveled while he
was ill, for at dawn he would hear. the
camp break up with a mighty noise
and feel his litter lifted by slaves, who
bore him along for hours across the
burning sand, till at length the even
ing came and with a humming sound,
like the sound of hiving bees, the
great army set it 3 bivouac. Then
came the night and the pale moon
floating like a boat upon the azure
sea above and everywhere the bright,
eternal stars, to which went up the
constant cry of "Allahu Akbar! Alla
hu Akbar! God is the greatest, there
is none but he."
"It is a false god, he would say.
"Tell theVn to cry upon the Savior of
the World."
Then the voice of Masouda would
seem to answer:
"Judge not. No god whom men wor
ship with a pure and single heart is
wholly false. Many be the ladders that
lead to heaven. Judge not, you Chris
tian knight."
At length that journey was done, and
there arose new noises as of the roar
of battle. Orders were given and men
marched out In thousands; then rose
that roar, and they marched back
again, mourning their dead.
At last came a day when, opening his
eyes, Godwin turned to rest them on
Masouda, and lo! she was gone, and In
her accustomed place there sat a man
whom he knew well â Egbert, once
Bishop of Nazareth, who gave him to
drink of sherbet cooled with snow.
"Where am I?" he asked.
"Outside the wajls of Jerusalem, my
son, a prisoner in the camp of Saladin,"
was the answer.
"And where is Masouda, who has
sat by me all these days?"
"In heaven, as I trust," came the
gentle answer, "for she was a brave
wonian. It was I who have sat by
you."
"Nay." said Godwin obstinately, "it
was Masouda."
"If so," answered the Bishop again,
"it was her spirit, for I have prayed
over her open graye â her spirit, which
came to visit you from heaven, and has
gone back to heaven now that you are
of the earth again. 1 *
â¢ * â¢
The siege went on; from terror to
terror it went on. The mangonels
hurled their stones unceasingly; the
arrows flew in clouds so that none
could stand upon the walls. Thousands
of the cavalry of Saladin hovered
round St. Stephen's gate, while the en
gines poured fire and bolts upon the
doomed town and the Saracen miners
worked their way beneath the barbican
and the wall. The soldiers within could
not sally because of the multitude of
the watching horsemen; they could not
show themselves, since he who did so
was at once destroyed by a thousand
darts and they could not build up the
breaches of the crumbling wall. Aa
day was added to day the despair grew
ever deeper. In every street might be
met long processions of monks bearing
crosses and chanting penitential psalms
and prayers, while in the house doors
women wailed to Christ for mercy and
held to their breasts the children which
so soon must be given to death or torn
from them to deck some Mussulman
harem.
The commander Balian called the
knights together in council and showed
them that Jerusalem was doomed.
"Then," said one of the leaders, "let
us sally out and die fighting in the
midst of foes."
"Aye," added Heraclius, "and leave
cur children and our women to death
and dishonor. Than tnat surrender is
better, since there is no hope of suc
cor."
"Nay," answered Balian, "we will not
surrender. While God lives there is
hope."
"He lived on the day of Hattin and
suffered it," said Heraclius; and the
council broke up, having decided noth
ing.
That afternoon Balian stood once
more before Saladin and implored him
to. spare the city.
Saladin led him to the door of the
tent and pointed to his yellow banners
floating here and there upon the wall
and to one that at this moment rose
upon the breach itself.
"Why should I spare what I have
already conquered," he asked, "and
what I have sworn to destroy? When
I offered you mercy you would have
none of it. Why do you ask It now?"
Then Balian answered him in the
words that will ring through history
forever.
"For this reason, Sultan. Before
God, If die we must, we will first
slaughter our women and our little
children, leaving you neither male nor
female to enslave. We will leave the
city and its wealth; we wÂ«!l grind the
holy rock to powder and make thÂ«
mosque el-Aksa and the other sacred
places a heap of ruins. We will cut
the throats of the 5000 followers of
the prophet who are in our power,
and- then, every man of us who can
bear arms, we will sally out into tha
midst of you and fight on till we fall.
So methinks Jerusalem will cost you
dear."
The Sultan stared at him and
stroked his beard.
"Eighty thousand lives," he mut
tered; "eighty thousand lives, besides
those of my soldiers whom you will
slay. A great slaughter â and the holy
city destroyed forever. Oh! it was of
such a massacre as this that once I
dreamed."
And Saladin sat still and thought
awhile, his head bowed upon his
breast.
CHAPTER XXIIL
Saint Rosamund.
From the day when he saw Saladin
Godwin began to grow strong again
and as his health came back, so he
fell to thinking. Rosamund was lost
to him and Masouda was dead, and at
times he wished that he were dead
also. What more had he to do with
his life, which had been so full of sor
row, struggle and bloodshed? Go
back to England to live there upon his
lands and wait until old age and
death overtook him? The prospect
would have pleased many, but it did
not please Godwin, who felt that his
days were not given to him for this
purpose and that while he lived he
must also labor.
As he sat thinking thus, and was
very unhappy, the aged Bishop Egbert,
who had nursed him so well, entered
his tent and, noting his face, asked:
"What alls you, my son?"
"Would you wish to hear?" said
Godwin.
"Am I not your confessor, with a
right to hear?" answered the gentle old
man. "Show me your trouble."
So Godwin began at the beginning
and told it allâ how as a lad he had
secretly desired to enter the church;
how the old prior of the abbey at Stan
gate counseled him that he was too
young to judge; how then the love of
Rosamund had entered Into his life
with his mandood, and he had thought
no more of religion. He told him also
of the dream thai, he had dreamed
when he lay wounded after the fight on
Death Creek; of the vows that he and
Wulf had vowed at the time of their
knighting, and of how by degrees he
had learned that Rosamund's love was
not for him. Lastly he told him of
Masouda.
The Bishop listened in silence till he
had finished. Then he looked up say
ing:
"And now?"
"Now," answered Godwin, "J know
not. Yet it seems to me that I hear
the sound of my own feet walking
upon cloister stones, and of my own
voice* lifted up in prayer before the
altar."
"You are still young to talk thus,
and there are other women in the
world," said Egbert.
Godwin shook his head.
"Not for me, my father. "
"Then there are the knightly orders,
among whom you mi^ht rise high."
Again he shook his head.
"The Templars and the Hospitalers
are crushed. Morover, I watched th^m
in Jerusalem and the field, and love
them not. Should they change their
ways, or "should I be needed to fight
against the Infidel. I ran join then
by dispensation in days to come. Put
counsel meâ what shall 1 do now?"
"Oh! my son." the old Bishop s:Â»M,
his face lighting up. ~Jf God calls
you, come to God. I will show you
the road."
"Yes, I will come," Godwin an
swered quietly. "1 will come, and.
unless the cross should once more
call me to follow it in war. I will
strive to spend the time that is left
to me in his service, and that of men.
For I think, my father, that to this end
I was born."
Three days later Godwin was or
dained a priest, there in the camp of
Saladin, by the hand of the Bishop
Egbert, while around his tent the
servants of Mahomet, triumphant at
the approaching downfall of the cross,
shouted that God is great and Maho
met was h.- only prophet.
Saladin lifted his head and looked
at Balian.
"Tell me," he said, "what of the
Princess of. Baalbec, whom you know
as the lady Rosamund d'Arcy? I told
you that I would speak no more with
you of the safety of Jerusalem until
she was delivered to me for judgment,
yet I see her not."
"Sultan," answered Balian, "we
found this lady in the convent of the
Holy Cross, wearing the robe of a
novice of that order. She had taken
the sanctuary there by the altar,
which we deem so sacred and inviola
ble, and refused to come."
Saladin laughed.
"Cannot all your men-at-arms drag
one maiden from an altar stone? â un
less, indeed, the great knight Wulf
stood before it with sword aloft," he
added.
"So he stood," answered Balian,
"but it was not of him that we thought,
though assuredly he wo-uld have slain
some of us. To do this thing would
have been an awful crime, which we
were sure must bring down the venge
ance of our God upon us and upon
the city."
"What of the vengeance of Salah
ed-din?"
"Sore as is our case, Sultan, we still
fear God more than Saladin."
Within an hour Bailan rode to the
city under safe conduct, taking with
him the envoys of Saladin and the let
ter, which they were charged to deliver
to Rosamund.
It was night, and in their lamp-lit
chapel the Virgins of the Holy Cross
upon bended knees chanted the slow
and solemn Miserere. From their
hearts they sang, to whom death and
dishonor were so near, praying their
Lord and the merciful Mother of God
to have pity, and to spare them and
the Inhabitants of the hallowed town
where he had dwelt and suffered, and
to lead them safe through the shadow
of a fate as awful as his own. They
knew that the end was near, that the
walls were tottering to their fall, that
the defenders were exhausted, and
that soon the wild soldiers of Saladin
would be surging through the narrow
streets.
Then would come the sack and the
slaughter, either by the sword of the
Saracens or perchance, if these found
time and they were not forgotten,
more mercifully at the hands of
Christian men, who would thus save
them from the worst.
â¢Their dirge ended, the abbess rose
and addressed them. Her bearing was
still proud, but her voice quavered.
"My daughters in the Lord," she
said, "the doom is almost at our door
and we must brace our hearts to meet
it. If the commanders of the city do
â¢what they have promised, they will
send some one here to hehead us at
the last and we shall pass happily to
glory and be ever with the Lord. But
perchance they will forget us. who
are but a few among 80.000 souls, of
whom some 50,000 must thus be
killed. Or their arm 3 may grow
weary or themselves they may fall be
fore ever they reach this house â and
what, my daughters, shall we do
then?"
Now some of the nuns clung to
gether and sobbed In their affright,
and some were silent. Only Rosa
mund drew herself to her full height
and spoke proudly.
"My mother," she said. "I am a
newcomer among you, but I have seen
the slaughter of Hattin and I know
what befalls Christian women and
children among the unbelievers.
Therefore I ask your leave to say my
say."
"Speak." said the abbess.
"This Is my counsel." went on Ros
amund, "and it is short and plain.
When we know the Saracms are In
the city let us set fire to this convent
and get us to our knees and so per
ish."
"Well spoken: It is best," muttered
several. But the abbess answered
with a sad smile:
"High counsel indeed, such as might
be looked for from high blood. Yet It
may not be taken, since self -slaughter
is a deadly sin."
"I see little difference between * it."
said Rosamund, "and the stretching out
of car necks. to the swords of friends.
Yet, although for others I cannot Judge
for myself I; do <udge who am bound
by no final vows. * I tell you that rath
er than fall into the hands of the Pay
nims. I will dare that 1 sin and leave
them nothing but the vile mold which
c-nce held the spirit of a woman."
And she laid her hand upon the dag
ger hilt that was hidden in her robe.
Then again the abbess spoke.
"To you. daughter. I cannot forbid
the deed, but to those who have fully
sworn to obey me I do forbid it and
te. th-em I show another If a more pit
eous way of escape from the last shame
of womanhood. Some of us are old and
withered and have naught to fear but
death, but others are still young and
fair. To these I say, when the end la
nigh, let them take steel and score face
and bosom and seat themselves here in
this chapel, red with their own blood
and made loathsome to the sight of
man. Then will the end come upon
them quickly and they will pass hence
unstained to be the brides of heaven."
Now great groan of horror went up
from those miserable women, who al
ready saw themselves seated in stained
robes \ and hideous to behold, there in
the carved chairs of their choir, await
ing death by the swords of furious and
savage men, as in a day to come their
sisters in the faith were la await it in.
the doomed convent of the Virgins of
St. Clare at Acre.*
Yet, one by one, except the aged
among them, they came upto the ab
bess and swore that they would obey
her in this as in everything, while the
abbess said that herself she would lead
them down that dreadful road of pain
and mutilation. Yes, save Rosamund,
who declared that she would die un
diaiigured as God had made her. and
â¢ two other novices, they swore it one by
one, laying their hands upon the altar.
Then again they got them to their
knees and sung the Miserere.
Presently, above their mournful
chant, the sound of loud, insistent
knocking* echoed down , the vaulted
roofs. Then they sprang up scream
ing:
"The Saracens are hear! Give us
knives! Give us knives:'* ~
â¢ Rosamund drew the dagger from Its
sheath.
"Wait awhile," cried the abbess.
"These may be friends, not foes. "Sis
ter Ursula, go to the door and seek
tidings."
The sister, an aged woman, obeyed,
with tottering steps, and, reaching the
massive portal, undid the guiehet, or
lattice, and asked with a quavering
! wit
"Who are you that knock?" while
the nuns within held their breath and
strained their ears to catch the an
swer.
Presently it came, in a woman's sil
very voice, that sounded strangely
still and small In the spaces at that
tomb-like church.
"I am the Queen Sybilla. with her
ladies."
"And what would you with us, O
Queen The right of sanctuary?".
"Nay; I bring 1 with me some envoys
from Saladin. who would have speech
with the lady Rosamund d'Arcy, who
is among you."
Now at these words Rosamund fled hi
the altar, and stood therÂ«, still holding
the naked dagger in her hand.
"Let her not fear," went on the sil
very voice, "for no harm shal come to
her against her will. Admit us, holy
abbess, we beseech you in the name of
Christ."
Then the abbess said, "Let us receive
the Queen : with such dignity as we
may." ; Motioning, to the nuns to take
their appointed seats in the choir* she
placed herself In the great chair at the
head of them, while behind her at the
raised altar stood Rosamund, the bare
knife in her hand.
The door was opened and through It
swept a strange procession. First came
the beauteous Queen, wearing her in
signia of royalty, but with a black veil
upon her head. Next followed ladies
of the court â twelve of them â trembling
with fright, but splendidly apparaled.
and after them t three stern and tur
baned Saracens clad in mail, their jew
eled scimitars at their sides. After
these again ; appeared a procession of
women, most of them draped in
mourning, and leading scared children
by the hand; . the wives, sisters and
widows of noble, knights and burgesses
of Jerusalem. Last of all . marched a
hundred or more captains and war
riors, among them Wulf, headed by Sir
Balian and ended by the patriarch
Heraclius in his gorgeous robes, with
his attendant priests and acolytes.
On swept the Queen, up the length of
the long church, and as she came the
abbess and her nuns rose and bowed
to her, while one offered her the chair
of . state that was set apart to be
used by the Bishop in his visitations.
But she would have none of it.
"Nay." said the Queen, "mock me
with no honorable seat who come her*
as a humble suppliant, and will make
my prayer upon my knees."
So down she knelt upon the marble
floor, with all her ladies and the fol
lowing women, while the solemn Sara
cens looked at her wondering and th*
knights and nobles massed themselves
behind. ;JRMBBHPifIB
"What can we give you, O Queen."
asked the abbess, "who have nothing
left save our treasure, to which ' you
are most welcome, our honor, and our
lives V
"Alas!" answered the royal lady.
"Alas! that I must say it! I coma to
ask the life of one of you."
"Of whom, O Queen?" <
Syb:!la lifted her head, and with her
outstretched arm pointed to Rosa
mund, who stood above them all by
the high altar.
For . a moment Rosamund turned
pale, then spoke in a steady voice:
"Say, what service can my poor Ufa
to be you. O Queen, and by whom is
it sought?"
- Thrice Sybilla strove to answer, then
murmured:
"I cannot. Let the envoys give her
the letter, if she can read their
tongue." % : .
"I . can- * read it," answered Rosa
mund, and a Saracen emir drew forth.
a roll and laid it against his forehead,
then gave it to the abbess, who
brought it to Rosamund. With her
dagger blade she cut its silk, opened it
and read aloud, always in the same
quiet voice, translating as she read:
"In the name of Allah, the. one, thÂ»

Rosamund finished , reading and the
â¢ letter fluttered from her hand down' to
the marble floor. Then the Queen said:
"Lady, we ask this sacrifice of you
In the name of these and of their fel-
I lows," and she pointed to the ,women
' and the children behind her.
â  And mv life?" " mused Rosamund
aloud. "It is all have. When I have
paid it away I shall be beggared," and
her -'yes 1 wandered to where the tall
shape of WUlf stood by. a pillar of the

"Perchance Saladin will be merciful,"
hazarded the Qqeen. jÂ» ..
"Why should he be merciful," an
swered Rosamund, "who : has always,
warned me that if I escaped from him
and as recaptured I must die? Nay,
he will offer me Islam or death, which
meansâ death." ' ...
"But if you stay here you must die,"
pleaded the Queen, "or at least fall into
the hands .-of . the soldiers. " Oh! lady,
your life la but one life and with it you
caji buy those â¢of eighty thousand
so'ulg." â¢
"Is that so sure?." asked Rosamund.
"The Sultan has made no promise: he.
. he says only that 'if I pray it of him'
he â¢ ill consider the question of spar
ing of Jerusalem." ;-*:.* r:
But â but," -went- on the Queen,
"he says also thai if you do not come
I he will certainly put Jerusalem to the
I sword, and to Sir Balian he said that
if you gave yourself up he thought he
might grant terms which we should be
glad to take. Therefore we dare ask
of you to give your life in payment
for such a hope. .Think â think, what
otherwise must be the lor of these."
and again she pointed to the women
and childrenâ "aye. and your own
,_ sisterhood and of all of us. Whereas, '
' if you die. it will be gently and with
I honor, and your name shall be wor-
I shiped as a saint and martyr in every
1 . church in Christendom.
-' "Oh, refuse not our prayer, but
show that you are indeed great
enough to step forward to meet the
death that comes to every one of us,
and thereby earn the blessings of half
the world and make sure your place
in heaven nigh to him who also died "
for men. Plead with her, my sisters
â plead with her!"
â  then the women and children threw
I themselves down before her, and with
tears and sobbing prayed her that she
11 give up her life for theirs.
Rosamund looked at them and smiled,
and said in a clear voice:
"What say you. my cousin. Sir Wuif
d'Arcy? Come hither, and. as is fitting
in this strait, give me your counsel." :
So the gray-eyed, war-worn Wulf '
strode up the. aisle, and. â¢ standing by
the altar rails saluted her. *" ' â ''â â 
"You have heard." said Rosamund..
"Your counsel? . Would you have me
die?" â¢ -. - â¢ ' ' : . ;. â¢;
"Alas!" he answered in - a hoarse
voice. "It is hard to 'speak/ Yet, they
are manyâ ivou are but one)": \
Now there was a- murmur of ap
plause. For It was known that this
knight loved the lady, and that but the
other day he had stood there to defend \
her to the death against those who
would give her up to Saladin.' .. .
Now Rosamund laughed out, and the.;
sweet sound of. her laugh, wag strange
in that eolemn place and hour. " .
"Ah. Wulf!" she said. "Wulf, who
must ever speak the . truth, .even when
it costs him 'dear. Well. I would not
have it otherwise. Queen, and all you
foolish people, I did but try your tem
pers. Could you, then, think me so
base that I would spare to spend this
poor life of mine, and to forego such
few joys as God might have in ntore
for me, when those of tens of thou
sands may hang upon the issue? Nay,
nay: it is far otherwise."
Then Rosamund sheathed the dagger
that all this while she had held in her
hand, and. lifting the letter from the
floor, touched her brow with it in : signal
j of obedience, saying. in Arabic to the
' v envoys:
"I am the slave <-f Salah-ed-Din,
Commander of the Faitnrul. I am the
small dust beneath his feet.- Take no
tice. Emirs, that in presence of all here
gathered, of my own free will I deter
mine to accompany you to the Sultan's
camp, there to make prayer for the
sparing of the lives of the citizens of
Jerusalem, and afterward to suffer the
punishment of death in payment of my
night, Recording to his high decree. One .
, request I make only, if he be pleased to
grant Itâ that my body be ' brought
back to Jerusalem for burial before this
altar, where of my own act I lay down
my life. Emirs, lam ready."
Now the envoys bowed before her in
solemn admiration and the air grew
thick with blessings. As Rosamund
stepped down from the altar the Queen
threw her arms about her neck and
kissed her, while lords and knights,
women and children, pressed their lips
upon her hands, upon the hem of her
white robe, and even on her feet, call
ing her "saint" and "deliverer."
"Alas!" she answered, waving them
back. "Am yet I am neither of these

"Aye." echoed Wulf. stepping to her
side, "let us be going." '
Rosamund started at the words, and ''
all there stared.
"Listen, Queen, Emirs and people "
he went on. "I am this lady's kins- ,
man and her knight, sworn to serve
her to the end. If 6 he be guilty of a .

"Oh, Wulf!" she cried. "You will but i
make it harder." . .
"No, no; faced hand in hand, death c
loses half its terrors. Moreover, Sala- i
din is my friend, and I also would 1

Then he whispered in her ear, "Sweet

( Now her eyes were full of tears and

Saladin looked at them, -but gay*
them no greeting. .Then he spoke.
"Woman, you have had my message?'
You know that your rank is taken from
you, and that with it my promises are
at an end; you know also that you
come hither to suffer death. Is it, so?"
"I know all these things, great Salah

"I come of my own free will, Sa.lah

"Sultan," said Wulf, "I counseled the
Lady Rosamund that she should come
not that she needed such counselâ and
having given it I accompanied her by :
right of blood and of justice, since her
offense against you is mine also. Her

"I have no quarrel against you, whom

"Doubtless." said Wulf. "being a -
Christian among many sons, of the
Prophet, it will not be hard to find a
friendly scimitar to help me on ; that \
road. I ask of your goodness, that her
fate may be my fate."
"What!" said Saladin. "You are ready
to die with her, although you are young
and strong and there are so many other
women In the world?"
Wulf smiled and nodded his head.
"Good. Who am I that should stand
between a fool and his folly? I, grant
the ' boon. Your fate shall be her fate.

out her arms toward: him,: was silent.
"These things I offered to them, and

Rosamund turned: and. stretch

\ upon his breast. There then, in the

i kissed their kiss ;of betrothal and fare- J

; titude ; and the * sound of it seemed to )
shape -j itself into one word : " "Mercy!"
*" ; Still â  Saladin made no sign, and they
were led away, to their prisons.
Among the n thousands who watched
this strange * and thrilling scene-, were
two men wrapped in long cloaks,. God-
win and ,' the â¢- Bishop \Egbert.'â¢â :-*;\ Egbert.' â¢â :-*; Thrice
:<lid Godwin - strive -, to ;-; approach the \

for they would not suffer him to stir :
or I speak; and 'â } when, as Rosamund '
' passed, he strove 'to s break : a way to

as she went by he cried: _/; . â¢
"The blessings of heaven be upon
you, pure saint â of â and on , you,
: title knight." . v
;'.*.> Catching the tones of .; that voice
above the tumult, Rosamund stopped :
and looked : around her, but taw no ';
one, for the guard hemmed her in. ~-j So ''â 
she went on, wondering if perchance
it was Godwin's voice which she had
heard,: or whether an angel, or only,
some prisoner, had spoken. , /
Godwin stood wringing his hands?
while the bishop strove ; to comfort him,
saying that \he should \ not f grieve, sinee ';:
such deaths as those of Rosamund and
Wulf : were most glorious, and : more to
be desired than a hundred lives.
"Aye, aye," answered Godwin, "would
that I could go with them!" / :
"Their "work 'is done,* but not yours,"
said the bishop gently. "Come to our
tent and let 'us ,to: our knees. God is
more : : powerful than % the { Sultan, and ; ;
mayhap he will yet find a way to save â¢
them. If " they are still alive to-mor

inhabitants of 'â  Jerusalem. : This is H the r
message: Let the holy city surrender
to-morrow { and ~i all i its - population ac- ;

Then for forty days I will hold them to v
ransom, during which â¢ time none shall V
be harmed. Every man who- pays ten

Such "who remain or have no muiit-y for
their ransom â and there is still much
gold in Jerusalem â shall become my
slaves. Those are my terms, which I
giant at the prayer of my' niece, the
lady Rosamund, and to her prayer
alone. Deliver them to Sir Balian,
and bid him wait on me at the dawn
with his chief notables, and answer
whether he is gc-ing to accept them on
behalf of the people. If not, the as
sauy: goes on until the city is a heap
of ruins, covering the bones of its chtl
di'en."
"We bless you for this mercy," said
the Bishop Egbert, "and we hasten to
obey. But tell us, Sultan, wjiat shall
wo de? Return' to the uamy with Sir
Balian?"
"If he accepts my terms, nay, for in
Jerusalem you will be safe, and I give
you your freedom without ransom."
"Sire." said Godwin, "ere I go grant
me leave to bid farewell to -my brother
and my cousin Rosamund."
"That for the third time you may
plot their escape from my vengeance?"
said Saladin. "Nay, bide in Jerusalem
and await my word; you shall meet
them at the last, no more."
"Sire," pleaded Godwin, "of your
mercy spare them, for they have played
a noble part. It is hard that they
should die who love each other and are
so young and fair and brave."
"Aye," answered Saladin, "a noble
pair; never have I seen on.c more noble.
Well, it fita them the better for heaven,
if cross-worshipers enter there. Have
done; my purpose cannot be turned,
nor shall you see them till the last, as
I have said. But if it pleases you to
write to them a letter of farewell and
to send It back by the embassy it shall
be delivered to them. Now go, for
greater matters are afoot than this
punishment of a pair of lovers. A guard
awaits you. '
So they went, and within an hour
stood before Sir Balian and gave him
the message of Saladin. whereat he rose
and blessed the name of Rosamund.
While he called his councilors from
their slee|> and bade his servants sad
dle horses, Godwin found pen and
parchment and wrote hurriedljvr
"To. Wulf, my brother, Â»anicl Rosa
mund, my cousin and his betrothedâ l
live, though well-nigh I died by dead
Masoudaâ Jesus rest her gallant soul:
Saladin will not suffer me to see you,
though he has promised that I shall be
with you at the last, so watch for me
then. I still hope that it may please
God to change the Sultan's heart and
spare you. If so. this is my prayer and
desire â that you two should wed as
soon as may be and get home to Eng
land, "vyhere. if I live. I hope to visit
you in years to be. Till then seek me
not, who would be lonely awhile. But
if it should be fated otherwise, then
when my sins are purged I will seek
you among the saintsâ you who by
your noble deed have earned the sure
grace of God.
"The embassy rides. I have no time
for more, though there is much to sa.y.
Farewell. GODWIN."
The terms of Saladin had been ac
cepted. With rejoicing because their
lives were spared, but with woe and
lamentation because the holy city had
fallen again into the hands of the Mos
lem, -.the people of Jerusalem made
r< ady to leave the streets and seek new
homes elsewhere. The great golden
cross was torn from the Mosaue Xl
Aksa and on every tower and wall
floated the yellow banners of Saladin.
Al.Wwho had money paid their ransoms
dim. those who had none and
borrowed It as they could, and if they
tKMjld not, gave themselves over to de
.fep*ir and slavery. Only the Patriarch,
Heraclius, forgetting the misery of
these wretched ones, carried off his
own great treasure and the gold plate
of the churches.
Then Saladin showed his mercy, for
he freed the aged without charge, and
from his own treasure paid the ransom
of hundreds of ladies whose husbands
and fathers had fallen in battle or lay
in prison in other cities.
So for forty days, headed by Queen
Sybilla and her ladies, that sad pro
cession of the vanquished marched
through the gates, and there were
many of them who as they passed the
conqueror, seated in state, halted to
make a prayer to him for those who
were left behind.' A few also remem
bered Rosamund, and that it was be
cause of her sacrifice that they contin
ued to look upon the sun. Implored him
that if they were not already dead, he
would spare her and her brave knight.
At length it was over and Saladin
took possession of the city. Having
purged the Great Mosque, washing it
with rose water, he worshiped in it
after his own fashion and distributed
the remnant of the people who could
pay no ransom as slaves among his
emirs and followers. Thus did the
crescent triumph, over the cross in
Jerusalem, not in a sea of blood, as
ninety years before the cross had tri
umphed over the crescent within its
walls, but with what in those days
passed for gentleness, peace and
mercy.
For it was left to the Saracens to
teach something of their own doctrines
to the followers of Christ.
During all those forty days Rosa
mund and Wulf lay in their separate
prisons, awaiting their doom of death.
The letter of Godwin was brought to
Wulf, who read it and rejoiced to
learn that his brother lived. Then it
was taken from him to Rosamund,
who, although she rejoiced also, wept
over it. and wondered a little what it
might mean. Of one thing she was
Â«ure from its wording, that "they had
no hope of life.
They knew that Jerusalem had
fallen, for they heard the shouts of
triumph of the Moslems, and from far
away, through their prison bars could
see the endless multitude of fugitives
passing the ancient gates laden with
baggage, and leading their children by
the hand, to seek refuge in the cities
of the coast. At this sight, although it
was so sad. Rosamund rejoiced, know
ing also thit she would not suffer in
vain.
At length the camp broke up, Saladin
and many of the soldiers entering Jeru
salem, but still the pair were left lan
guishing in their dismal cells, which
were fashioned from old tombs. One
evening, while Rosamund was keeling
in prayer before she sought her bed,
the door of the place was opened, and
there appeared a glittering captain and
a guard of soldiers, who saluted her
and bade her follow him.
"Is it the end?" she asked.
"Lady," he answered, "it is the end."
So she bowed her head meekly and fol
lowed. Without a litter was ready, in
which they placed her and bore her
through the bright moonlight into the
city of Jerusalem and along the Way
of Sorrow, till they stood at a great
door, which she knew again, for by it
stood the ancient arch.
"They have brought me back to the
Convent of the Holy Cross to kill me
where I asked that I might be buried,"
she murmured to herself as she de
scended from the litter.
Then the doors were thrown open,
and she entered the great courtyard of
the convent, and saw that it was deco
rated as though for a festival, for
about it and in the cloisters hung
many lamps. More, these cloisters ana
the snace in front of them were
crowded with Saracen lords, wearing
their robes of state, while yonder sat
Saladin and his court.
"They would make a brave show of
my death,"' thought Rosamund again.
Then a little cry broke from her lips,
for there, in front of the throne of Sal
adin. the moonlight and the lamiJ
biaze shining on his armor, stood a tiiil
Christian knight. At that cry he
turned his head, and she grew sure
that it was Wulf, wasted somewhat
and grown pale, but still Wulf.
"So we are to die together," she
whispered to herself, then walked for
ward with a proud step amidst the
deep silence, and, having bowed to Sal
adin, took the hand of Wulf and
The Sultan looked at them and said:
'"However long it may be delayed,
the da>y of fate must break at last.
Say, Franks, are you prepared to drink
th* dregs of the cup I promised you?"
"We are prepared," they answered
With une voice.
D<> you grieve that you laid down
your lives to save those of all Jerusa
lem?" he asked again.
"Nay," Rosamund answered, glanc
ing at Wulf's face, "we rejoice exceed
ingly that God has been so good to
"I, too, rejoice," said Saladin, "and 1.
too, thank God who in bygone days
sent me that vision, which has given
me back the city of Jerusalem without
bloodshed. Now, all is accomplished
as it was fated. Lead them away."
For a moment they clung together.
then emirs took Wulf to the right ana
Rosamund to the left, and she went
with a pals face and high head to meet
her executioner, wondering if she
would see Godwin ere she died. They
led her to a chamber where waited
women, but no swordsman that she
could see, and shut the door upon her.
"Perchance I am to be strangle/1 by
these wonlen," thought Rosamund, as
they came toward her, "so that the
blood royal may not be shed."
With gentle hands, but in silence,
they "unrobed her, and washed her with
scented waters and braided her hair,
twisting it up with pearls and gems.
Then they clad her in fine linen and
put over it gorgeous, broiderpd gar
ments and a royal mantle of purple,
and her own jewels, which she had
worn in bygone days, and with them
others still more splendid, and threw
fut her head a gauzy veil worked
l golden stars. It was such a veh
kVulfs gift, which she had worn on
night when Hassan dragged her
from h?r home at Steeple. She noted
it and smiled at the sad omen, then
"Ladies, why should 1 mock my
'loom with thÂ«Â»se bright garments?"
"'lt is the SuJtan'fl will," they an
swered, "nor shall you rest to-night
I<9M happily because of them."
Xow all was ready and the door
opened and she stepped through it. a
radiant thing, glittering in the lamp
light. Then trumpets blew and a her
ald cried: "Way: Way there: Way for
the Princess of Baalbec!"
Thus followed by the train of ladies
wh,o attended her, Rosamund glided
forward to the courtyard and once
more bent the knee to Saladin, then
stood still, ldst in wonder.
Again the trumpets blew and on the
right a herald cried, "Way! Way
there !^ Way for the Frankish knight,
Lo! attended by emirs and notables,
Wulf crime forth, clad in splendid
armor, inlaid with gold, wearing on
his shoulder a mantle set with gems
and on his breast the gleam star of the
luck of Hassan. To Rosamund he
strode and stood by her, his hands
noting on the hilt of his long sword.
"Princess." said Saladin, "I give
you back your rank and titles, because
you have shown a noble heart, and
you. Sir Wulf, I honor also as best I
may. but to my decree I hold. Let
thtrn go together to the drinking of
thf.cup of destiny as to a bridal bed."
Again the trumpets blew and the
htralds called and they led them to
the doors of the chapel, which at their
knocking wore thrown wide. From
within came the sound of women's
vc'.ces singing, but it was no sad song
they sang.
"The sisters of the order are still
there." said Rosamund to Wulf, "and
would cheer us on our road to
heaven."
"Perchance,"' he answered. "I
know not. lam amazed."
At the door the company of Mos- .
lems left them, but they crowded
round the entrance as thougrh to
watch what passed. Now down the
long aisle walked a single white
robed figure. It was tjie abbess.
"'What shall we do, mother?" said
Rosamund to her.
"Follow me, both of you." she said,
and they followed her through the
nave to the altar rails, and at a sign
from her knelt down.
Now they saw that on either side
of the altar stood a Christian priest.
The prieFt on the right â it was the
Bishop Egbert â came forward and
began to read over them the marriage
service of their faith.
"'They'd wed us ere we die," whis
pered Rosamund to Wulf.
"So be it," he answered; "I am
"And I also, beloved," she whis^
percd back.
The service went on â as in a dream
the service went on. while the white
mbed sisters sat in their carven chairs
and watched. The rings that werÂ»
handed to them had been interchang
ed; Wulf had taken Rosamund to
wife, Rosamund had taken Wulf to
husband, till death did them part.
Then the old Bishop withdrew to
the altar, and another hooded monk
came forward and uttered over them
tb" benediction in a deep and sonor
ous voice, which stirred their hearts
most strangely, as though some fcho
reached them from beyond the grave.
He held his hands above them in
Ing and looked upward, so that
his hood fell back, and the light of
the altar lamp fell upon his face.
It was the face of Godwin, and on
his head WBI the tonsure of a monk.
Once more they stood before Saladin.
and now their train was swelled by
the abbess and sisters of the Holy
Cross.
"Sir Wulf D'Arcy,'" said the Sultan,
"and you, Rosamund, my niece. Prin
cess of Baalbec, the dregs of your cup,
sweet and bitter, of bitter-sweet, are'
drunk, the doom which I decreed for
you is accomplished, and. according
to your own rites, you are man and
wife, till Allah sends upon you that
death which I withhold. Because you
showed mercy upon those doomed to
die and were the means of merov t
also sivp you mercy, and with
love and honor. Now hide here if you

mander of the Faithful. Conqueror and
Caliph of the Kast."
Trembling, full of joy and wonder,
they knelt before him and kissed his
hand. Then, after a few swift words
between them. Rosamund spoke.
"Sire, that God whom you have in
voked, the God of Christian and ot
Moslem, the God of all the Â«
though the world worship him in many
shapes, bless and reward you for thid
royal deed. Yet listen to our petition.
It may be that many of our faith still
lie unransomed in Jerusalem. Take mv
lands and gems, and let them be val
ued, and their price given to'Dav for
th^ liberty of some poor slaves. It si
our marriage offering. As for vÂ«. we
wIH set us to our own country."
"So be it." answered Saladin. "The
lands I will take and devote the Â»urnÂ«
c,f them as you desire â yes, to the last
bezant. The jewels also shall be val
ued, but I give them buck to you as
my wedding dower. To these nuns
further I grant permission to bide
here in Jerusalem to nurse the sick,
unharmed and unmolested, if so they
will, and this because they sheltered
you. Ho! minstrels and heralds, letd
this new wed pair to the place that
has been prepared for them."
Still trembling and bewildered, they
turned to go, when lo! Godwin stood
before them, smiling, and kissed them,
both upon the cheek, calling them
"Beloved brother and sister."
"And you. Godwin?" stammered
Rosamund.
"I. Rosamund, have also found my
bride, and she is named the Church
of Christ."
"Do you then return to England,
brother?" asked "Wulf.
' Xay. ' Godwin answered in a fierce
whisper and with flashing eyes, "the
cross is down, but not forever. That
cross ha? Richard of England and
many another servant across the seas
.#nd they will come at the church's J
call. Here, brother, before all is done. 1
we may meet again in war. Till then, j
farewell." I
So spoke Godwin and was gone.

1Â»hot off the car and hurried down
the street toward my office. Hear
ing a man remark as he passed,
"Queer looking customer; looks
like a real Westerner," I glanced
up. Walking ahead of me was a figure
that brought to my mind joyful recol
lections of the past. ? >-*.:
The peculiar walk induced from con
stant wearing of heavy leather chaps,
the rounded shoulders designated as
the "cowboy hump," and the wide
â white hat, all bespoke the plains. I
overtook the man and grabbed a big
tmn.
' "Is It really you, Hank?" I cried.
"How did you get so far away from
home?"
A big, weathered, humorous face In
which anxiety struggled looked down
on me.
"If it ain't that cussed little would
be cowboy Jim growed to a man!
Who'd a-thought he'd made such a
food one?" he remarked as he nearly
â¢wrung my hand off in his recognizing
shake.
"Come up to my office, it's right
here, and we will talk."
"I was Just huntin' you. I've got a
hull corral full of trouble on hand."
Seated in my private office, I sent the
'boy for whisky and told him that I was
engaged on important business and to
allow no one to disturb me.
"Now, Hank.' said 1 to my silent
old-time comrade of vacation days,
"tell me what up. Killed a man and
vant a lawyer?"
â¢.Naw!" and a contemptuous look
overspread his worried face. "I'm
on a kidnaping trip and I want you to
help me."
A girl?" 1 ventured. He looked more
tlis gristed than ever. ,
"Naw. It's the kins of the Crooked
H I'm- after. Ever heered of him?"
1 shook my head, puzzled, and, pour
ing out a big drink of whiskyÂ« offered s
it to him. His eye brightened, but he
shock his head slowly.
".N'aw. If we don't rind the king you
owe it to me. While we ma find him
I'll play fair. It ain't allowe? at court
and I'm his prime minister: leastways
that's what my boss says."
i was debating whether Hank. had a
screw Joose or. was playing some intri- ,
cate practical jc-ke, when i caught the
sound of a sob as he cleared his throat.

â¢â¢Two~Vt-axs ago- 1 â as down at Jink's
place. I an' Goody Twer Shoes was
each aiming to win a bet as to which
could drink the most and not show it
before- the bound train cum in. We
augered and augered till the train slides
in before we knowed it, and I only had
tix drinks in me.
"I seed from the door a woman and
two kids git put off. The train went on
and left 'em standing lookin' all over
for a town that wasn't there.
"They hadn't no luggage, and she and
the kids hadn't enough hull clothes on
to flag a handcar. She had a purty
face, tho. So when I seed her makin*
for the. section house that was full of
Russians that chewed up Uncle Sam's
language I shied over. I says: Madam,
kin I do anything fer you?'
"She began to cry, then the little kid
In her arms begun to squall. The little
feller bout six at her side grabs it and
rets it quiet.
"Then the woman says: 'I'm cryin'
because there ain't more people here. I
thought this was a bigger place. My
old man got killed up in Cripple, an'
me an' the children are tryin* to beat
our way home to Indianapolis, where
ma lives. When we git put off we git
& collection took up to go a ways fur

"I didn't know what to do, but I con
sidered us cowboys as kings of that
place an" we couldn't do no wrong, cur
besides us there was only the Russians
and the crabbed old station agent that
didn't count either. So I just asked
the woman over to the saloon porch
and brought her some crackers, cheese
and beer.
"She was mighty grateful and we all
rot quite friendly and began amusin'
the kids. The little girl was cross, but
the little boy was the manliest little
feller you could see in a ten days' ride.
"Goody put the idee int my noggin*
by savin 1 to the little feller: 'How'd
you like to go to a ranch and live and
grow up to be a cowboy?'
- " 'I'd like it mighty well, mister, but
._' 1 can't leave ma an 1 " Sissy; they need
me.'
"There was a. heap more to that little
youngster than to his ma â a young,
Billy, helpless kind of being. After a
â¢while I got a chance to speak to her
alone. I asked her if she would let me
take the kid and raise it fer her, if I'd
give her fifty dollars and her ticket.
She Jumped at the offer.
"I never seed such a look in any one's
face, big or small, as there was on that
boy's when she told him. He looked as

" "When we goin' home. Hank?' said
he, puttin' his little paw in mine.
â  Now. Come on fellers, let's dig
out,' said I to the boys that was stand
in" by lookin" foolish. Only Goody hung
back, said he want drunk enough fer
Sunday, said it would make him lone
some to go home half full.
"The little chap eyed him with his
black look-through-you eyes, then he
walked up in front of Goody.
â ' That's what killed pa and put me
and ma on the tramp. Let's go home,'
he said, coaxing like, and held out his
little paw. ,
"Goody looked silly fer a mlnit. Then
he grabbed the youngster and put him
on his shoulder.
" 'Come on, boys, I was only fooling.
Git your hosses and see who gits home
fust.' *
"We sure kept that kid from being
lonesome, gittin' home. One would grab
him and ride him awhile, then another
one; so all of us had a turn at holdin'
the gritty little feller. Time we got
home there want one of us men that
wasn't a willin' slave to that boy. Why!
we couldn't eat much supper cus he
couldn't!
" 'Little feller's got to go to bed. He's
beat out,' 1 said, and stood firm that he
had to bunk with me.
"After he got to sleep we set up and
talked about how we'd make him
comfy and chirky.
" 'Ain't we got a cow critter we can
break to milk? I heer coffee ain't good
fer little folks,' Cracky growled as he
chawed hard on his pipe.
" *I seed one yesterday that I'll intro
duce myself to,' said Goody, spittin'
vigorous. 'I know how to make good
molasses candy,' chimes in Jiggers â
he's the kid there, cum from the East
to get teached the ranchin' trade same
as you.' The cowman's face looked at
me with kindly humor an instant, then
he went on:
'We had to plan to have one stay at
home and see that nothing happened to
The little kid. It was mostly Jiggers.
He kicked, sed he cum out to ride an'
not to tend kindergarten. I asked him
what he was going to do.
" '1 might fan th^ breeze,' sez he.
" "What about that saddle you owe
me fer?' And Jiggers stayed.
"One night we cum home hungry as
coyotes and I slammed in an' opened
ihe oven door 10 see if biscuit was done.
I see only a lot of round brown things.
â  What the h-ll," sez I.
â  â <jh, Hank:' sez the little feller.
'them's marbles that Jiggers made me
out'n clay and they's bakin'. You ain't
mad, be you?'
"I laugbed stead o' cussin', and went
out to tell the boys the joke, an' we all
waited good-natured till Jiggers got
fcupper ready.
"Oar boss heerd of our new family
member and he cum out from town red
eyed an' foamin*. Sed he want runnin*
no baby farm. "How could the men
ride and play nurse too. Anyhow the
Humane Society wouldn't stand fer it.
Furthermore, he used to think there
was bigger fools than cowboys, but he
was mistook.'
"I held myself in, but itched to kick
the old man. I only asked him to git
into the rig, as the horse was oneasy,
and we'd best dust. He looked at me
with eyes wide and mouth open, struck
dumb. Finally he cum to his breath:
"'l'll be blasted: Here it's Sunday
and you ain't drunk nor actin' like you
wanted to be.' Then he says short,
looking round, 'Where's the rest of the
boys? I don't see any of my horses
tied up at the saloon.'
" 'Home,' sez I, laughin' inside.
" 'I'll be teetotally chawed up and
spit out again!' he sez, and dumb into
the cart, never even sayin' howdy to
Jink's place.
"He didn't say nothin' more 'bout the
boy until we got most home, then he
turns quick like and sez: 'What are
you Roing to do with him?"
" 'Keep him,' sed I.
" 'What If I say you shan't?'
" 'Then you kin get new men to work
you d-d old ranch,' sez I, and whipped
up Buttons.
"The boy was ready fer us and open
ed the gate. 'Good evening, Mr. Boss,'
Fed he as he come up manly like, 'want
a new hand?'
"The boss looked him all over and I
see the twinkle come into his eye. I
don't know if it was us old stagers
quitting fer a mite of a baby you might
say, or if it was the funny flgger he
looked with his pleading eyes and soft,
round face with black curl 3 flapping a
little in the wind toÂ»- of my old shirt
and overalls I'd cut down best I
could; any way the boss laughed.
Then he sez. 'Want a Job bad?'
"The kid busts out joyful, 'Oh, you're
going to let me stay!' and he ran up
and grabbed Boss' hand, shook it and
sez, 'I'll work good.*
' 'What's your name?' sez Boss, all
gentle. k U
" 'Roy, sir.'
" 'Roy! Why that means king! That's
what you are, and here's your prime
minister and there's your cabinet,'
pointing to the other three that were
coming out of the shack, all grins when
they see the little man run up to Boss.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL
"That's how King got his name. We
alluz called him that.
â¢' What you going to do come round
up time?' sed Boss when we was smok
ing after supper. I
11 'Take him with us,' I spoke quick
and settled.
" 'H'm! What you going to give him
to eat? Kids can't live on beans and
bow belly same as you boys does.'
" 'We Just thought that mebbe you'd
send us out some garden seeds,' 1 sug
gested mild like. Boss stared.
" 'You blooming locoed cow puncher!
Don't you know a garden takes time
and water?'
" 'We've got Sundays and bits of
extra time,' I put in, 'and there's a well
full of water that the windmill draws
up.'
" 'You kin punch cows all right, but
you bloody cuss, you'd look well pack
ing water in buckets over to a garden.'
" 'You send the seeds, never mind
how I look.'
"And the seeds come.
"We teached King to cuss beautiful.
"Onct I ketched him whimpering over
a hard bump he got falling off a hoss
he was practicing up on. I set right
down and telled him that men don't cry
at anything, but just cuss to relieve
their feelings; he mustn't cuss at
hosses, cuz mostly the man is the wust
and ornarieet fool of the two; and he
mustn't cuss at men onless he had a
gun to back him; but he could cuss at
cow critters, fer they was plumb or
nary; and he could break loose and cuss
at stoves and firewood and slch like;
but onless he was hurt awful bad he
mustn't cuss, fer it want being game.
"He remembered all we told him to.
Onct I met old Benson on the road and
he wanted to borrow my razor, being
as a new gal was in the country. I
told him he could go up to the house
and shave there, that he couldn't lug
the razor off, fer we all cleaned up
Sundays. Benson waltzed In, went to
my bunk and was Just drawing the
razor out from the mattress, when a
child's voice behind him piped up:
" 'Put that razor down.'
"Being in a hurry Benson said, 'Mind
your own business, kid,' without turn
ing round. Then a string of cusses
broke loose that startled old-timer Ben
son and he whirled round to see King
standing in the doorway pinting the
little gun I give him right at him. Old
Benson was too 'sprised and scairt to
explain, and I don't know what 'ud a
happened if Jiggers hadn't cum in just
then and fixed things up.
"We teeched King everything we
knew, even to poker; but we stuck at
book larnln'. One night I winked at
the boys and sez: 'If I only knew some
one that could write letters fer me and
kind o' look after accounts I'd be
happy.'
" 'And if I had some one to read the
news to me once in a while I'd feel
better when I went out in company,'
put in Goody.
" 'And if I had somebody to tell me
about gogerfy when I wants to go
places it ud cum in mighty, handy,"
added Cracky. Jiggers spoke up then:
" 'I know all that, cause I went to
school, but I get too tired to help you
out evenings.'
"King never sed a word, but kept up
a hull lot o' thinking. Next day I
heerd him coaxing. 'Lara me, won't
you, Jiggers? I won't worry you morn
I kin help.'
"Fust thing I knowed they was
savin" all the wrappin' paper that cum
round the groceries and smoothin' it
out and flggering all over it. King
saved every scrap of reading that cum
to i' ranch, even to advertisements
and soap wrappers. Bless his baby
heart! saved everything 'gainst the
time when he could read 'em to us. He
learned fast, too. Jigger* did wonders
with him. They was both proud.
"Once I cum home kinder early from
ridin' and found King peelin' spuds. He
looked up and sed onconsarned as you

" 'Milk cow's got a new calfâ Jiggers
went to fetch It, so I tho't I'd get sup

"Why every one of us locoed cow
punchers would have rid the wildest
hoss that pitched just to please King.
He was home, he was love, he was,
he was the hull world fer us boys.
"One day when Jiggers brought in the
mail he looked mighty queer and sed,
'Here's a letter for Roy McPherson â
that's you, King.'
"King shakes his head: "Ust to be,
but I'm King Crater now'â the last is
my name, you know â '
" 'Guess you'd better read it, King, 1 I
sed in a weak voice.
"The King was eight then and could .
read most anything. Never was a
smarter kid. We all quit smokin' quick
and set quiet while King read this here
letter."
The cowboy paused and, fumbling in
his pocket, produced a folded, soiled
scrap of paper which he handed me. I
opened and read:

I handed back the letter and my
friend resumed his story.
"When King finished readin' we were
all still and gone white at the cold

of its consequences.

"I got here this mornin' and went

and no one seems to know where they

The cow puncher looked so miserable
when he ceased speaking that I in
stinctively went over and patted him
on the back.
"We will find him!" I cried with de
termination in my voice.
Hank and I swung around the even
ing paper office all that afternoon. We
questioned every newsboy that came to
buy papers for the evening sale. Many
knew Roy McPherson, but had not seen
him lately. We were beginning to de
spair when at last we came upon a
little shaver who said he knew Roy and
had seen him only yesterday buying a
nickel's worth of tea at a corner gro
cery 9tore. We got the address and hur
ried to the place.
Yes, the grocer knew Mrs. McPher
son. She was sick and the boy waa
taking care of her and doing a little
janitor work on the floor where they
lived above the store.
We went up a rickety outside flight
of stairs and kno-ked at a shattered,
door opening in the narrow landing.
We heard whispers, then little feet trot
ted across the room, the door opened a
bit and the any. dimpling face of a
very little girl peeped out at us.
"Hello, Sissy:" cried Hank, reachinw.
in and catching the child up, "Where*
brother?"
A smothered cry of joyful recognition
came from within. With a warning
little hand lifted, a thin, sad little fel
low hastened to the door and whis
pered. "She's asleep, don't wake her.
I'll come outside."
Hank dropped Sissy and gathered the
little man to his bosom exactly as a
10-nging mother would have done. The
light of yearning love was so Intense
on the man's face that I turned aside.
â¢ My boy! my boy!" he murmured and
smoothed the head again and again.
The boy hid his face in the man's
coat and his little body shook convul
sively, but no sound came. After a bit
we three sat on the stairs.
"You must go back with me," urged
Hank, his hand gripping the boy's arm
so hard that he winced.
"Ma can't spare me this time," said
a voice struggling to be firm.
"We will send her money."
Roy's face shone an Instant, then his
lips came together hard.
"There Is Sissy. Ma ain't able to
bring her up alone. I've got to- do It."
Hank's face waa a study between
admiration and de
spair. Nothing waa
said for a while.
The pitiful but Qrm
little face with its
longing eyes nearly
overcame me, so I
looked at Hank.
The fierce hunger
of the eye* was)
startling, but the

Being Hard Luck Tales and Doings of an Amateur Hobo
miles away in the desert piCKC-d me
up as a valued asset, and the caravan
of mules and canvas-covered wagons
moved majestically across the sandy
waste. The boss of tho outfit, a large,
hairy Mormon, traveled with all the
comforts of home. His personal
retinue consisted of eight subdued
wives and forty-six children. We
looked like an orphan asylum out for a
Straw ride, minus the straw. Three
wagons, each drawn by six mules,
transported the family. The proprietor
and hi* wives, in a congested state of
connubial felicity, led the procession.
Their offspring rode in two double
docked warons built after the man
ner of menagerie cages. Large and
medium sized children occupied the
lower romimrlments and fought each
other to a finish, while the tots en
joyed the better air and scenery af
forded by the roof gardens.
Behind the nursery straggled at least
twenty huge wagons In echelon; but I
didn't know that until years afterward,
when I saw pictures of battleships in
echelon at Hampton Roads. This for
mation was an idea of the boss Mor
mon, who was a frugal man. The
drivers and workmen comprised the
rear guard and kept a sharp lookout
foi sunbonnets, shoes, playthings and
Vv omans Exchange.
However, it happens now and then
that some man who is really a good fel
low is deceived by this foolish saying
into believing that if he only stands in
one place long enough opportunity will
oome along and help him into the band
wagon. Thi6 is a real tragedy, for op
portunity usually goes down another
street to pick up another man who
railed on her a year ago and made an
appointment and has been sending her
postal cards once a week ever since to
remind her of the engagement. We
could proceed in this abstruse and
highly Instructive manner for an in
definite time, but bitter experience has
taught us that most people are from
Missouri and require to be shown.

overboard along the way. Progress â¢
was slow because of heavy going over i
a roadless route and the frequent stops
made to tally up the kindergarten. Six
days were required to cover the fifty !
miles, much time being lost in the con- :
struction of bridges across dry gullies I
and hustling to find water for the ani- i
mals. i
Something like one hundred men and
boys represented the bone and sinew of
the expedition. We worked our passage
to the scene of actual toil in return for
board and lodging en route. There was
little to do except lighten the pathway
of the mules by pushing the heavy
wagons from behind and hauling on the
wheels in sandy ruts.
The vehicles were laden to the guards
with plows, scrapers and provisions,
mostly salt pork and beans in bulk. At
the campfires, night and morning, we
cooked viands enough to last until the
next halt. Each man carried his own
blankets, in which he slept on the
ground beside the wagons and listened
to the coyote cooing to its mate in the
stilly watches of the night. Quite
poetical!
Polygamy, as practiced in that grad
ing camp outfit, was a rare and pleas
ing spectacle when Mr. Simpkins plant
ed his family in the desert at our jour
ney's end. He carried a ready-made
community with which to populate any
region he chose to infest. His eight
wives all dressed alike in limp blue sun
bonnets and limper red calico gowns,
which obliterated whatever beauty and
shape those unfortunate females may
have possessed. One sallow, biscuit-fed
Mrs. Simpkins weighed ninety pounds;
another ranged close to 300 and was
built on the lines of a mud scow. Side
by Fide, these two suggested a herring
and a halibut.
There was method in Mr. Simpkins'
multitudinous joy-sharers. They fried
salt pork for the hoboes and saved the
expense of employing Chinese for that
purpose. A pack of shaggy dogs herded
the children in their waking hours.
From out of the chaos of that wind
swept, sun-blistered caravan of tired
babies and hardened men grew a vil
lage containing many of the latest im
provements, including a water works.
On a level stretch miolway of the sec
tion we intended to grade Mr. Simp
kins waved his wand, and the city burst
from its shell. All hands lived in tents.
Little canvas structures of the army
pattern were set up for the men, with
the Simpkins layout as a sort of gov
ernment seething in the mlddleyOne
tent as large as that used by the fly
by-night country circus housed the
eight wives and forty-six children.
A long, narrow tent attached to one
side of the Simpkins abode served as a
dining hall, in which the wives elected
to that service did the honors three
times per day. Pork and beans, flap
jacks and a flour gravy known as
"Mormon white" stirred our jaded ap
petites some. Occasionally the ladles
passed out a little "hereafter," alias
dessert, in the shape of dried fruit
bank. His functions were sweeping the
floor and emptying .the spittoons and
going after the mall and buying cigars
for the first vice president and other-,
wise assisting in important "financial
transactions. He reasoned that where
there was bo much money corded up
and lying around loose there ought to
be a little sticking to the fingers of
faithful employes now and then.
He hadn't been there a year before
he discovered there were a few cases of
such attachment, but the paying tel
ler, whose fingers had glue on them,
took an enforced vacation for a term
of years and Patient Walter learned
that the leopard is not the only beast
whose stripes are difficult to change.
Aside from this isolated instance, the
embryo financier failed to find any ex
amples of unusual financial betterment
arising from connection with the bank.
It was a hard problem, but he figured
it out finally that the people who have
the most money are generally the

stewed in river water. The nearest
vaterâ Snake Riverâ was twelve miles
ilstant, so Mr. Simpkins installed a
ivater wagon. He built a tank on
vheelp, calked the seams with white
cad and placed one man and four
nules in charge. This system was kept
n operation night and day in order to
supply the camp, and the river water
Hdn't lose anything after
welve miles in the tank.
One evening at dusk the water
wagon straggled into camp in charge
)f the faithful mules. The day driver
âa morbid hobo of moody habits â
had disappeared. They found his
moist remains in the tank while trans
ferring the water to barrels. Whether
he committed suicide or fell into the
opening behind the seat never will be
known, as we had no Coroner. Any
how, Mr. Simpkins was plainly an
noyed and spoke with some bitterness
of the carelessness of certain people
intrusted with delicate missions. That
tankload of water was reserved ex
clusively for the mules, and the camp
wiggled along on emergency rations
until another cargo could be brought
from the river. The driver was buried
In the sand with a broken neckyoke
marking the spot â tombstone and epi

The vanguard of civilization â two
tinhorn sports, one barrel of whisky
and a pok<jr table â reached the camp
one lap ahead of the main expedition.
We had our saloon in full blast be
fore the tented town was laid out. The
tinhorn sports opened for business un
der a naming canvas of red. white and
blue, their idea being: to please tn~e
optic nerve as well as tickle the vitals.
They placed the barrel on end in the
center of the tent, laid a board across
the head for a bar and placed thereon
half a dozen small-sized baking pow
der cans. The drinking cups bore
the inscription, "Absolutely Pure."
but this legend did not apply to the
contents of the barrel. That fluid was
of the brand now known as biograph
whisky â two drinks and you see the
moving pictures without extra charge.
Amid these surroundings I entered
upon a new life among the Mormons,
and didn't like the place. Poker was
too rich for my blood, and the liquid
biograph films at 25 cents per can
were beyond my means, so I devoted
myself exclusively to building the
Oregon Short Line. Those of you
who glide in Pullmans along that
route never dreamed, perhaps, that I
was there ahead <'f :ou as chief en
gineer of a two-handled scraper and
one span of pie-colored Mormon
mules.
Building railroads in the desert is
quite romantic at times, and, as few
of the scraper hands have embalmed
the sport, in literature, I submit the
foregoing details just to show what
some men will do in order that others
may ride â sometimes on passes. That
makes If bad again. I
At one part of our section the grade

his money are soon divorced, but a
man Is likely to be a fool about almost
anything before money. People who
are fools about that seldom have any

Disappointed in his earlier hopes.
Patient Waiter settled down to the
grim conclusion that the waiting game
was the one for him. He was reliably
informed that there wag room at the
top, and although thtre seemed to hh a
good many going in that general direc
tion, he was firmly convinced that if
he only kept along with the crowd he
would reach the summit in the course
of time. There were only seventy-five
men between him and the cashier as
it was, and he calculated from actuary
tables that his chance of surviving was
at least large enough to be discerned
with the naked eye on a clear day.
Therefore he applied himself to his
broom and his spittoons. He used to be
sitting on the steps every morning
and a pork pie. Logic is a great ting,
sir; but it should not be boddered wit
after you know dat two and two make

"Surely," says Miss Fannie, who was
sitting wit de gents, "surely, Paul, ev
ery man and woman knows dat two
and two make four."
"Excuse me, me dear," says Mr. Paul.
"Most people see dat two and two make
four, but mighty few of 'em know it.
Supposing dat I see a snake or a whirl
wind. Would I go chasing all over de
town saying dat I knew a snake and a
whirlwind? De police wouldn't let
me. Tt is seldom dat a man knows dat
two and two make four. How often
Bremen know it I don't pretend to say,
but from me observations in a brief
but well-spent life I dope it out dat
women try to figure two and two into
five or tree as often as do men."
"Dis is nonsense," says Whiskers.
"Chames, didn't I speak to you about

On de level he had. but dat was
anodder nodder. But I chases in wit
a frosh one from de ice box in de but

dust that burned the eyes and blis
tered the throat. The dry earth was
hauled in scrapers from the level
stretches and dumped at the head of
the fill. Then man, mule and scraper
tumbled in a free-for-all down the
sloping bank, kicking up clouds of
choking white dust that floated away
on the breeze like blizzard snow. It
took longer to build the embankment
because of the wind and the vast
quantities of dust swallowed by the
busy toilers. For this job I pulled
down $1 50 a day and board. They

Avould have stayed and died, no doubt,
but for an unconscious tip furnished
by a tramp with St. Vitus' dance.
He came along one Sunday, twtich
ing and jerking like a marionette and
whistling a merry tune. Nothing wor
ries the genuine tramp, so long as he
Isn't working. Tttat fellow was a
phenom. He bore a pack of blankets,
grub and two one-gallon water cans
slung over his shoulders. In his right
hand he carried a long handled fry
ing pan, which, In the throes of his
affliction, he swuni and waved and
rattled like a Salvation Army lass with
her tambourine leading the bass
on to glory. Dropping his
pack and pan at the water barrel, the
tramp stopped whistling and said:
"Howdy, fellers; hot here, ain't it?"
Then he helped himself to Snake Riv
er water from Mr. Simpkins' barrel.
I am not making jest of human af
fliction, and I trust this true statement
will find credence: In order to slake
his thirst the jiggly tramp seized the
dipper in both hands, filled ft and rent
ed the bottom on the rim of the bar
rel. In his weird contortions he
spilled more than half the liquid nnd
danced one and a half times around
the barrel, still holding the dipper In
position and sliding it along as hÂ»
danced. Having swallowed all that
didn't get away from him, Mr. St
Vitus straightened up with a satisfied
"ah" and looked tbÂ«e, camp over. He
seemed to like the idea of compan
ionship, if only for a little while. So.
i, ithering a bundle of sagebrush twigs,
he built a fire and sliced some bacon,
which he fried in the long-handled
pan: made a pot of coffee and dined
within ten feet of where a bunch of us
were sitting.
That is what I call independence
without any special declaration of the
same. I have seen less violent cases
of this malady hopelessly immured in
hospitals, and here was a victim whose
very hair twlWrhed with muscles run
amuck. A thousand miles from no
where, and at least another thousand
to the next place, that writhing
wanderer showed his contempt for the
heavy hand of fate, the usages of
hospitality and the world in general.
He tarried with us merely to save the
precious water in his cans. After din
ing and carefully wiping the frying
pan with a niece of gunny sack. Mr.
St. VKus packed up and two-stepped,
polkaed and walt2ed himself away in
to the wilderness. Long after the sage
brush and dust hid his twitching form
waiting for the janitor to uniocK me
door and let him at his work.
If the other young men who occupied
subordinate positions in that financial
institution possesed a burning desire to
do twice as much work as they were
paid for, they concealed it admirably.
They appeared on the scene on the
minute, or a trifle after if they thought
the boss would be down late, and they
departed with equal promptness. They
stretched the lunch hour till it cracked,
and snatched a brief respite for a sur
reptitious cigarette now and again.
Neither did they show any willingness
to stand and. wait for opportunity to
come around and tap them on the
shoulder. Most of their spare time ap
peared 'o be spent in looking for a
better job, and every now and then one
of them would find it. Then he would
depart without noticeable regret or any
apologies to opportunity for not wait
ing for her.

THE wiseacres of the neighbor
hood were discussing- the ques
tion of common sense, sitting
about the- blacksmith shop, wait
ing: for their horses to be shod, when
a silence that had suddenly fallen
warned old Limuel Jucklin that it was
time for htm to say something.
"Yes." he remarked, "good, hard
horse sense is of so rare a quality that
it is nearly always taken for genius.
All that most any man needs is a little
judgment, the very governor on the
machinery of this life, and bein' so
needful it is what we seem to be most
lE.ckin' in. To know how to do a thing
isn't much more important than
know-in' what not to do. Knowin' when
to do it is real genius. If you cut your
whtat before it's rips you get sappy
straw for your labor. If you wait too
long you get but dry straw. Judgment
comes from experience, and common
sense is the wisdom 'beat into the heads
of men that have gone before."
â "You leave out education-" spoke up
a schoolmaster.
"Oh, no, I don't, for education is the
experience of the mind, It sjoea back
beyond all books, and the first book
must have been .written out of experi
ence. But to read of the common sense
of other men don't always give its
common sense of our own. In my house
is a book written by a man named
Kant, and he calls it the 'Critique of
Pure Reason.' Well, since I have more

did eat, but all the time I was

didn't appear to have any meanin'.
After dinner I took it up again
and fought with it, holdjn' . it
this way and that, up and down,
in the sun at the .window and
in the shade, but I'll be hanged if
I could get at the juice of it. Finally,
however, I struck one thing that paid
me for all my trouble, and it was this,
as near as I can remember it: 'A man
may read all books and understand
them, and he -may be able to speak all
languages, and yet all this can
not atone - for a lack of what we know
as ' mother wit.' Mother wit, horse

"Then education Is useless," said, the

like an experiment. There are two sorts

"That's all right and it may be true,

Old man Bristntine said that he was
willing. He was sure that he was in

grandfather had been noted as the best
horse trader in the State, 'an<l, ' he
added, "if it hadn't been for him I

naw, but then lumbering at
Beesori Lake, lent some money
to â  man named Crothers, tak
ing in return a mortgage on what was
known as the Crothers tract of white
pine. In due time, as Crothers did not
liquidate, the firm became possessed of
this tract. They hardly knew what to
do with it.
* The timber was situated some' fifty
miles f rcm the railroad in a country
that threw all sorts of difficulties
across the logger path and had to be
hault-d from nine to fifteen miles to
the river. Both Morrison and Daly
groaned in spirit. Supplies would have
to be toted in to last the entire" winter,
for when the snow came, communica
tion over fifty miles of forest road
would be as good as cut off. Whom
could they trust among the lesser fore
men of their woods force? Whom
could they spare among the greater?
At this juncture they called to them
Tim Shearer, their walking boss and
the greatest riverman in the State.
"You'll have to job' her," said Tim
promptly.
"Who would be hired at any price to
go up in that country on a ten-mile
haul?" demanded Daly skeptically.
"Jest one man." replied Tim, "an' I
know where to find him. '
He returned with an individual at
the sight of whom the partners glanced
toward each other in doubt and dis
may. But there seemed to be no help
for it. A contract was drawn up in
which the firm agreed to pay $6 a
thousand, merchantable scale, for all
eawlogs banked at a rollway to be sit
uated a given number of miles from
the forks of Cass branch; while on his
side James Bourke, better known as
th "Rough Red," agreed to put in at
least 3,500,000 feet.
"That means a crow of wild Irish
men," said Morrison. -â¢â ;â¢- ':'.
"And that means they'll just slaugh
ter the pine," added Daly. "They'll
saw high and crooked, they'll chuck the
tops â who are we gc-ing to send to
scale for 'em?"
Morrison sighed. "1 hate to do it;
there.? only Fitz can make it go."
So then they called to them another
of their best men, named Fitz Patrick,
and sent him away alone to protect the
firm's interests, In the depths of the
â wilderness.
The Rough Red was a big broad
faced man, with eyes far apart and a
bushy red beard. He wore a dingy
mackinan coat, , a dingy black and
â white checked flannel shirt, dingy blue
trousers, tucked into high socks and
lumberman's rubbers. The only spot of
color in his costume was the flaming
red sash of the voyageur which he
passed twice around his waist- When
at work his' little wide eyes flickered
with a baleful wicked light, his huge
voice bellowed through the woods in a
torrent of imprecations and commands,
his splendid muscles swelled visibly
even under his loose blanket coat, as he
wrenched suddenly and savagely at
some man's stubborn cant-hook stock.
A hint of reluctance <or opposition
brought his fist to the mark with irre
sistible impact. Then he would pluck
his victim from .the snow and kick him
to work with a, savage jest that raised
a laugh from everybody â excepting the
object of it.
At night he stormed back through the
forest at the head of his band, shriek
ing wild blasphemy at the silent night,
Irreverent, domineering, bold, with a
certain tang of Irish good nature that
made him the beloved of Irishmen.
In the work was little system, but
much efficacy. The men gambled,
drank, fought, without a word of pro
test from their leader. With an ordi
nary crew such performances would
have meant slight accomplishment, but
these wild Irishmen, with their blood
Â£hot eyes, their ready jests, their
equally ready fists, plunged into the
business of banking logs with all the
abandon of a carouse â and the work
yv&a done.
On Thanksgiving day the entire place
went on a prolonged drunk. The Rough
Red distinguished himself by rolling
the round stove through the door into
the snow. He was badly burned in ac
complishing this delicate jest, but
minded the smart no more than he did
the admiring cheers of his maudlin but
emulative mates. Fitz Patrick extin
guished a dozen little fires that the
coals had started, shifted the intoxi
cated Mallan's leg out of the danger of
some one's falling on it, and departed
from that roaring hell-hole to the
fringe of the solemn forest. And this
brings us to Fitz Patrick.
Fitz Patrick was a tall, slow man,
with a face built square. The lines of
his brows, his mouth, and his jaw, ran
straight across; those of his temples.
cheeks and nose, straight up and down.
His eye was very quiet and his speech
rare. When he did talk It was with
deliberation. For days, sometimes, he
would ejaculate nothing but monosyl
lables, looking steadily on the things
about him.
He had walked in ahead of the tote
team late one evening in the autumn,
after the Rough Red and his devils had
been at work a fortnight. The camp
consisted quite simply of three build
ings, which might have been identified
as a cook camp, a sleeping camp and a
stable. Fitz Patrick entered the sleep
ing camp, stood his slender scaling-rule
in the corner and peered about him
through the dusk of a single lamp.
He saw a round stove in the center,
a littered and dirty floor, bunks filled
THE SGALER
with horrible straw and worse blank
ets jumbled here and there, old and
dirty clothes drying fetidly. He saw
an unkempt row of hard-faced men
along the deacon seat, reckless in bear
ing, with the light of the daredevil in
their eyes.
"Where is the boss?" asked Fltz Pat
rick steadily.
The Rough Red lurched his huge form
toward the intruder.
"I am your sealer," explained the lat
ter. "Where Is the office?" 9
"You kin have the bunk beyand," In
dicated the Rough Red surlily.
"You have no office, then?"
"What's good enough fer th' men is
good enough fer a boss; and what's
good enough fer th' boss Is good enough
fer any blank-blanked sealer."
"It is not good enough for this one,"
replied Fitz Patrick calmly. "I have no
notion of sleepin' and workin' In no
such noise an' dirt. I need an office to
keep me books and th' van. Not a log
do I scale for ye, Jimmy Bourke, till
yeze give me a fit place to tally In."
And so it came about, though the
struggle lasted three days. The Rough
Red stormed restlessly between the
woods and the camp, delivering tre
mendous broadsides of oaths and
threats. Fitz Patrick sat absolutely
imperturbable on the deacon seat, look
ing straight in front of him, his legs
stretched comfortably aslant, one^hand
supporting the elbow of the other,
which in turn held his short brier pipe.
"Good mornin' to ye, Jimmy Bourke,"
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL 7 .
said he each morning, and after that
uttered no word until the evening, when
it was, "Good-night to ye, Jimmy
Bourke," with a final rap, rap, rap of
his pipe.
The cook, a thin-faced, sly man with
a penchant for the Police Gazette, se
cretly admired him.
"Luke out for th' Rough Red; he'll
do ye!" he would whisper hoarsely
when he passed the silent sealer.
But In the three days the Rough Red
put his men to work on a little cabin.
Fitz Patrick at once took his scaling
rule from the corner and set out into
the forest.
His business was, by measuring the
diameter of each .log, to ascertain and
tabulate the number of board feet put
in by the contractor. On the basis of
his single report James Bourke would
be paid for the season's work. Inevita
bly he at once became James Bourke's
natural enemy, and so of every man in
the crew with the possible exception of
the cook.
The two men early came to a clash
over the methods of cutting. The
Rough Red and his crew cut any
where, everywhere, anyhow. The
easiest way was theirs. Small timber
they skipped, large timber they sawed
high, tops they left rather than trim
them into logs. Fitz Patrick would
not have the pine "slaughtered."
"Hey! Fitz Patrick! Come here, you
blanked-blanked-blank of a blank!
Come here!"
The. sealer swung leisurely down the
travoy trail and fronted the other with
level eyes.
"Well?" said he.
"Why ain't that log marked?"
"I culled it."
"Ain't it sound and good? Is there a
mark on it? A streak of punk or rot?
Ain't it good timber? What th' blank's
th' matter with it? You tried to do me
out of that, you blank skunk!"
A log is culled, or thrown out, when
for any reason it will not make good
timber.
"I'll tell you, Jimmy Bourke," replied
Fitz Patrick calmly. "Th' stick Is
sound and good, or was before your
murderin' crew got hold of it, but if

on a six-Inch slant. They've wasted a
good foot of th' log. I spoke of that
afore; an" now I give ye warnin' that
I cull every log, big or little, punk or
sound, that ain't sawed square and
true across th' butt."
"Th' log is sound an' good, an' yell
scale It, or I'll know th' reason why!"
"I will not," replied Fitz Patrick.
The following day he culled a log in
another and distant skidway whose
butt showed a slant of a good six
inches. The day following he culled
another of the same sort on still an
other skidway. He examined It closely,
then sought the, Rough Red.
"It is useless, Jimmy Bourke," said
he, "to be hauling of that same poor
log from skidway to skidway. You
can shift her to every travoy trail in
STEWART
EDWARD WHITE
th' Crothers tract, but it will do ye
little good. I'll cull It wherever I find
it and never will ye get th' scale of
that log."
The Rough Red raised his hand, then
dropped It again, whirled away with a
curse, whirled back with another and
epat out:
â¢' By i Fitz Patrick, ye go too far.
Te've hounded me and harried me
through th' woods all th' year! By -
'tis a good stick, an' ye shall scale it!"
"To' an' yore Old Fellows Is robbers
alike!" cried one of the men.
Fltz Patrick turned on his heel and
resumed his work. The men ceased
theirs and began to talk.
That night was Christmas eve. After
supper the Rough Red went directly
from the cook camp to the men's camp.
Fitz Patrick, sitting lonely in the little
office, heard the sounds of debauch ris
â¢lng Bteadily like mysterious storm
winds in distant pines. He shrugged
bis shoulders and tallied his day's
scaling and turned Into his bunk wear
ily, for of holidays there are none In
the woods save Sunday. About mid
night some one came in. Fltz Patrick,
roused from his sleep by aimless blun
derings, struck a light and saw the
cook looking uncertainly toward him
through bloodclotted lashes. The man
was partly drunk, partly hurt, but
more frightened.
"They's too big fer me. too big fer
me!" he repeated thickly.
Fitz Patrick kicked aside the blank
ets and set foot on the floor.
"Le' me stay," pleaded the cook. "I
won't bother you; I won't even make
a noise. I'm skeered."
"Course you can stay," replied the
sealer. "Come here."
He washed the man's forehead and
bound up the cut with surgeon's plas
ter from the van. The man fell silent,
looking at him In wonderment for such
kindness.
Four hours later, dimly through the
mist of his broken sleep, Fltz Patrick
heard the crew depart for the woods
in the early dawn. On the crest
of some higher waves of consciousness
were borne to him drunken shouts and
maudlin blasphemies. After a time he
arose and demanded breakfast.
The cook, pale and nervous, served
him. The man was excited, irresolute,
eager to speak. Finally he dropped
down on the bench opposite Fitz Pat
rick, and began:
"Fitz," said he, "don't go in th' woods
to-day. Th' men is fair wild wld th'
drink, and th* Rough Red is beside
hi'self. Las' night I heerd them. They
ape goin' to skid th' butt log again and
they swear that if you cull it again
they v.ill kill you. They mean it. That s
all why they wint to th' wood 3 this
di\y."
Fttz Patrick swallowed his coffee in
silence. In silence he arose and slipped
on his mackinaw blanket coat. In
silence he thrust his beechwood tablets
Into his pocket and picked his pliable
sealer's rule from the corner.
"Where are ye goin'?" asked the cook
anxiously.
'I'm goin' to do th' work they pay
me to do." answered Fitz Patrick.
He took his way clown the trail, his
face set straight before him, the smoke
of his breath streaming behind. The
first skidway he scaled with care, lay
ing his rule flat across the face of each
log-, entering the figures on his many
leaved tablets of beech, marking the
timbers swiftly with his blue crayon.
The woods were empty. No ring of
the ax, no shout of the driver, no fall
of the tree broke the silence. Fitz Pat
rick comprehended. He knew that at
the next skidway the men were gath
ered, waiting to see what he would do;
gathered openly at last in that final
hostility which had been maturing all
winter. He knew, besides, that most
of them were partly drunk and wholly
reckless and that he was alone. Never
theless, after finishing conscientiously
skidway number one, he moved on. to
sktdway number two.
There, as he had expected, the men
were waiting- in ominous silence, their
eyes red with debauch and hate. Fit*
Patrick paid them no heed, but set
about his business.
Methodically, deliberately, he did the
work. Then, when the last pencil mark
had been made and the tablets ha(J
been closed with a snap of finality, the
Rough Red stepped forward.
"Ye have finished with this skid
way?" asked the foreman In soft cat
tones.
"I have," answered Fltz Patrick
briefly.
"To" have forgot to scale one stick."
"No."
"Ther? is a stick still not marked."
"I culled it."
"Why?"
"It was not sawed straight."
Fitz Patrick, threw his head haofc
proudly, answering Ufl man atease. as
an accomplished swordsman. The
Rough Red shifted his feet, almost
awed in sjite of himself. One aft
other the men dropped their eyes and
stood ill at oase. TIM sealer turned
away, his heel caught a root, ho stum
bled, instantly the pack was <m him,
for the power of his eye was broken.
Mad with rage, they kicked and beat
and tore at Fitz Patrick's huddled form
long after consciousness had left v.
The. nan owl hooted from the s^
of the wood, or a puff of wind -
by, or a fox barked, or some other lit
tle thing happened, so that In blind,
unreasoning panic they fted. The place
was deserted save for the dark figure
against the red and white snow.
Fltz Patrick regained his wits in pain
and so knew he v.as still on earth.
Every movement ccst him a moan, and
some agency outside himself inflicted
added torture. After a long time he
knew it was the cook, who was firmly
but kindly kneading his limbs and
knuckling his hair. The man proved to
be In a maze of wonderment over his
patient's tenacity of life.
"I watched ye," he murmured sooth
ingly. "I did not dare Interfere. But
I kern to yo' 's soon as I could. See.
here's a fire that I built for ye, and
some tea. Take a little. And no bones
broke! True for ye, ye're a hearty man,
and strong with th' big muscles on yo
fit to fight th' Rough Red man to man.
Get th' use of yere legs, darllnt, an'
I'll take ye to camp, for it's fair drunk
they are by now. Sure an' I tole yeÂ»
they'd kill ye."
"But they didn't,' muttered Fits Pat
rick, with a gleam of humor.
â¢Sure 'twas not their fault, nor yere
own!"
Hours later, as it seemed, they moved
slowly in the direction of camp. The
cold had stiffened Fitz Patrick's cuts
and bruises. Every step shot a red
wave of torture through his arteries to
his brain. They came in sight of camp.
It was silent. Both knew that the men
had drunk themselves Into a stupor.
Then as they looked, a thin wreath of
smoke curled from under the open
doorway and spread lazily in the frosty
air. Another followed, another, still an
other. The cabin was afire.
"They've kicked over th* stove
again," said Fltz Patrick, seating him
self on a stump. His eyes blazed with
wrath and bitterness.
"What yo' going to do?" asked the
cook.
"Sit here." replied Fitz Patrick grimly.
The cook started forward.
"Stop!" shouted the sealer fiercely.
"If you move a step I'll break your
back!"
The cook stared at him through sau
cer eves.
"But they'd be burnt alive!" he ofc
jected wildly.
"They ought to be," snarled the
sealer. "It ain't their fault I'm here to
help them. 'Tla their own deed that
I'm not lying beyant there in th' forest,
unable to help myself. Do you under
stand? I'm yet out there in th*
woods!"
"Ah, wlrra, wirra!" wailed the cook,
wringing his hands, "Th' poor lads!"
He began to weep.
Fltz Patrick stared straight in front
of him for a moment Then he struck
his forehead, and with wonderful agil
ity, considering the injuries he had but
just received, tore dawn the hill in the
direction of the smoldering cabin. The
cook followed him joyfully. Together
they put out the fire. The men snored
like beasts, undisturbed by all the
tumult.
" "Tis th' soft heart ye have, after
all, Fitz.' said the cook delightedly, as
the two washed their hands in prep
aration for a lunch. "Ye could not
bear t' see th' lads burn."
Fitz Patrick glowered at him for an
instant from beneath his square brows. .
"They can go to hell for *11 of me,"
he answered finally, 'but my people
want these logs put in this winter, am'
there's nobody else to put them to."

â¢T A. YE you seen -, the picture coif
1 \ fure?
I j It is the very latest thing in
â *>J the world of dress and it is
: . â¢ cm whenever there is the
least possible occasion for it.
Hair-dressing in these days is Cither
cne thing or the other. It is very, very
6imple or very, very elaborate, and
therv simply isn't any satisfactory go
between.
Tho dainty way the Southern lassies
rolled their hair required but a simple
deft twist of the hand and a glistening
lose fresh from the garden, but the
more elaborate style demands that one
begin* to crimp the day before. Not
to mention the three good hours that
are necessary to pile the structure up
until it resembles a court head-dress
revived from the days of the early
queens of England.
- -â¢â Â- â -.â â â 
But whichever way the hair is worn
matters but little, for the real crown
ing glory is the dainty trifle that com-,
pletes a fetching costume. If the frock
is a simple one jewels are entirely out
of place, but a bouquet of ribbon violets
fastened high in the back and permit
ted to hang down dangerously near the
stock is nut only very pretty, but very
becoming as well.
If the gown is of the 1633 period, the
coiffure must be tossed up very high
and fastened with a handsome empire
comb. And combs, by the way, are
just the price n . /wishes to pay. The
high backed ones, rather square in
shape and studded with jewels, cost
in the neighborhood of two or three
hundred dollar;?, but the shell ones are
inexpensive and the effect is almost as
stunning, though, of course, the fame
idea at elegance Is lacking.
With the empire or Josephine coiffure
one wears one of these very tall combs
set well up on the back of the head.
In addition to this there is the comb
which is set tow in the back and is
pushed deep in the hair to hold up the
little locks at the back of the neck.
Besides this, some feshion will also
permit two sidecomts, if one really
reeds them or If they are too smart
to be left at home to ornament the
dressing table.
The great variety of. combs worn
this year is quite enough to puzzle the
uninitiated. Just how and where to
wear them is more difficult to solve
than a Chinese puzzle. There is one
xatLer pretty arrangement that shows
& coil in the middle of the back of the
head. Amid this are set four combs
form in g- a square. Of course, they are
cither plain or of wld, else the jewels
ehould match the jewels of one's cos
tume and that falls rather too heavily
on anything bin a well filled pocket
book.
Illy the prettiest and the most
popular hair ornament la the new rib
bon (lower. Rom* and violets are so
cunningly fashioned that they look -as
though they should have remained in
the garden. The roses are decidedly
unconventional, Irregular and almost
ragged, but they are beautifully tinted
and are a delight to the fastidious
heart.
They- are especially charming when
tucked in the hair at one side and that
they ai c popular is fchown by the way
they are steadily appearing at efter
noon functions. And this Is not the
only way they are making themselves
known to the Emart world, either.
Here and there violets or roses are
arranged all along the top of the coif
fur*;, v. here they look from the front
like a bed of sweetness growing from
my lady's head.
A pretty idea is carried out by the
more dashing gii. The flower* that
are used as a crown are set with little
pearl headed pins or beads which look
tcmetfalng like drops of- dew. It goes
without saying that they always form
a pretty contrast to tLe posies arid add
a bit of Illness that Is absolutely
captivating.
And, while I think of it, 1 want to
cay bat all flowers and applique work
of a flowery nature that are seen on
French costumes just now show this
dewdmp effect and occasionally in opa
lescent shades, and very beautiful they
arp, too.
Many pretty little nothings are plan
ned for the brunette in order that her
beauty may be shown off to the best
advantage. For her there Is the lovely
feathery aigrette, the beautiful pearl
comb, the wonderful rope erf , pearls
wound about her pompadour and â¢ the
glittering, glinting butterflies of gold
and silver. Then, too, she has * her
choice of colors, for she can wear pink,
blue or corn color to advantage, where
her blonde sister gains an insipid look
that is anything but pleasing or allur
ing.
But the fair lassie has not been left
out in the cold by any manner of
means, for Jet has been converted Into
charming trifles for her use. Besides
this birds of Paradise feathers have
been fashioned into sweeping aigrettes
for her and great bows of silver rib
bon are used in place of the neck curL
All these Tittle effects are amazingly
pretty; an not so terribly â¢extravagant .
srhen MM stops to consider that the
lack of them means an otherwise per

GERTRUDE (Etiquette)â lt is not
necessary to make one's adieux to one's
hostess at a crowded tea. She is too
busy welcoming her guests and it is
frequently a little awkward to - be
obliged to stop and say good-by.
MISS M. (Finger-bowls) â Finger

any kind of a dessert plate, but be sure
to place a to place, a doily under the

CLARA ( Waists)â China silk waists
most decidedly are not pretty for thin
peopled They are too clinging and too
thin and really should be strictly
avoided. It's too bad, I know, because
they are pretty, but there are scores of
fabrics that will answer just as well
and that will not look so common in
the bargain. If yc-u must have silk,
why not get one of the new lining silks.
They wash splendidly and .look about
50 per cent better after they have
visited the tubs. The silk seems to
settle down and the stiffness comes out
and forgets to crease every time any
one looks at it. The effect is like a
splendid quality of hiavy China silk,
the like of which wo seldom find in this
country. When made up with a heavy
lace they are awfully swell and very
serviceable as well, and they certainly
are not expensive, a the silk itself
costs but 5S cents a yard.
MAY (Jewelry)â are several
places In town where you .can buy
quaint jewelry.'or have it made if you
cannot find any that pleases you ex
actly. The firms who deal in jewels
and stones always retain a designer
and he will make two or three designs
if you will write or tell him your idea
and what stones you want used*.
2. Yes, there are any number of new
or rather old stones being used , these
days and they are not only smart, but
very effective as well. Especially a
peculiar red stone, commonly called the
sun stone. It was used rin pins and
fancy headgear about the time of Louis
XIV. The ancients combined stones,
whether precious or otherwise, and the
results were remarkr.bly beautiful, so ,
much 60, in fact, that a small army of
skilled people . arc kept busy supplying
theÂ«demands of the jewel-loving public.
A. D. (Card Party)â ' afternoon
card party is rather a simple little
affair to give if you go about T it in the
easiest way. Issue your Invitations
some ten days in '"â  advance and â  retain ..
a friend or two in case of an emer
gency, for at the last moment ' some ,
one may dlssappoint you. Make score
cards of flowered wall paper that you
can buy by the yard and use golden
stars or some bright little thing to
designate the lucky ones. Serve punch, â¢'
for instance, a fruit one, ; during; the ,
afternoon and get small bonbon dishes
tilled with -; salted almonds ' or candles â 
on each table. ' Later use the card â 
tables for refreshments, as it will not
only be a treat deal easier for yourself,
but j more . convenient ; and pleasant ', for
your friends. Salad v ' and j; bread-and- ,./
butter sandwiches are always nice and
not very difficult to prepare. Serve
olives with them, by the way. Later,
serve icecream or water Ice with fancy
cakes, and if you like, black coffee,
though it is entirely unnecessary. This
is ample and if served daintily will be
very pleasing. By the way, why not
ask some uf your little friends to play
waitress. They usually think it grea(
fun and are remarkably deft for ama
teurs.
MARY W. (Trotter)â The short walk
ing skirt is called a â¢'trotter," and it
most certainly is not slang to speak
c-f it as such. I believe the French
were responsible for this name, which
seems very appropria'j to me. There
are two lengths worn now, one for rain
â¢and the other for ordinary occasions.
The short one is very short, some four
or live inches from the ground, while
the other Just escapes In a pretty walk
ing length. Yes. trotters are worn for
nearly all occasions. A crepe sun
pleat <_d black skirt worn 'with a black
chiffon waist is considered quite elabo
rate enough tcr wear to the theater and
it is no rare thing to see a dainty soft
baby blue silk made ,in this short
length.
2. You asked about a silk mull for
evening wear. They are lovely when
they are pretty, but it requires yards
of material and heaps of work to make
them look like anything at all. The
baby effects are the prettiest, for the
mull Is soft and always seems simple
and girlieh. If you can match the
color exactly lawn will do nicely for
a lining and see to it that it is fluffy
and pretty, too. Of course, silk is al
ways nice, but lawn that costs 10 cenU
a yard will do almost, If not quite as
well. I am taking it for granted that
you meant a short ekirt, for lawn or
any substitute for silk never answers
as well if the drop skirt is long, for
when it is held up or the outer skirt
twists ever so little, all the glaring
faults are in evidence and the effect is
anything but pretty.
MRS. F. H. (Chow-Chow)â Here is
an excellent recipe that Is in the Twen

given away by The Call a few weeks

quarts of green cucumbers (small ones
If possible, if not large ones), cut in
pieces; 2 quarts of green tomatoes, if
large slice them; 1 quart of email

the cucumbers in brine until the next
day. Drain. Scald tomatoes, cauli
flower and beans in salt and water
until partially tender. Then drain in
a colander. Mix all together thorough

tablespoonsful mustard. Mix the mus
tard with some cold vinegar and the
flour smooth in the same way. Let the
vinegar boil and stir in the other in
gredients. Scald, stirring constantly,
and turn over the pickles boiling hot.
Seal at once. In the absence of cauli

of a very firm cabbage head may be
used in amount equally 2 quarts when
shredded. The" beams may be omitted
if difMcut to obtain. If there is not
enough liquid, add boiling vinegar.
Some prefer to add 1 bottle of the

before putting in the cans to give a
better flavor. Mix it thoroughly with
the rest. Pack in the cans and turn
in the scalding mustard vinegar. One
dozen ears of sweet com cut from the
cob may be added.
COLORS, 20 (Colors)â Brown is a
pretty color, but not always satisfac
tory, because it fades so quickly, more
so than almost any other color it seems
to me. If your skin is not too dark I
should think it ought to be very be

PRETTY TRIFLES
FOR EVENING WEAR
Instance, a yellow waist witn a nrown
tailor suit or a tan or pongee shirt
waist suit. All ther-e tones blend nicely
and shoes, gloves and ribbons, not to
mention hats, always look as though
they had been selected with the great
est care. Besides this, there are com
binations that lighten and brighten up
a dull color. Tan with a dash of red
Is smart and I should Imagine particu
larly good for you since your eyes are
dark and your skin also. When red Is
becoming It is vastly so. I would not
suggest black, although young people
can wear it better than older women,
according to my opinion. Still, with a
little one, it might appear too somber.
I am rather old-fashioned as to a ward- .
robe. I believe in having a few pretty
clothes and in wearing thc;n out and
always being rather up to date. For
instance, a short tailor suit is an ab
solute necessity. Have a chic tailored
hat and some fur and three pretty
shirtwaists and that is complete. A
silk shirtwaist suit Is another necessity
for afternoon wear when the cloth suit
lg not exactly fit. It may have a coat
or a waist just as you please, but the
coat makes it more satisfactory, as it
may be worn with a soft lace waist
md dainty light tan or cream hat.
ouched up with a bit of contrasting
jolor. For evening or afternoon wear
nipagne crepe made wun a trans
parent yoke^ and sleeves is always
dainty and appropriate. Have an inner
lining, so that it may be worn both
high and low. The same cream hat
will do. Of course, such a frock de
mands a cloak, but these days there
are such smart rain coats that th y
tan be used for all purposes. Now,
honestly this outfit does not cost so
much and I believe it all that is nec
essary, inasmuch as you do not â¢<>
abo-ut very much. Tan or suede shoes
are smart and do not cost one cent
mere than black and if you wear brown
all the time you can afford to wear
them, as they will always be in good
taste. The russet for morning or the
tailor suit and the suede for evening
or afternoon wear. If you try the one
tone experiment I am certain you will
like it, unless you are one of those
unfortunate lassies tire of every
thing quickly. The other questions I
will answer personally as soon as I
have the opportunity.
JEXXIE (Pretty Party Accessories).
There is so much more than just a
pretty frock in the perfect party out
fit. Xo girl likes to hide her lovely
gown en route to a dance in just
any old ulster or mackintosh. A
dainty cloak with a delicate gown is
half the pleasure of fluttering away
to any evening's merry making.
And besides the cloaks, for a winter
night there must be a hood of a bit
of gauze for the head. And always
a bag of some light-tinted material for
slippers and fan and gloves.
These things really count as much
in a well-planned outfit as the cor
rect footgear or the right sort of
corsage bouquet or beads of some
Eort â for a girl is not smartly cos
tumed for any occasion this season
without beads in harmony with the
colors of her frock.
Girls who have any gift for design
ing and sewing get up small clubs, just
the most intimate chums, and make
their own cloaks, hoods and bags
once the cost of making is done away
with, these pretty accessories can be
had for so little money that almost
no girl need be debarred from the
pleasure of their pleasant possession.
Cas+imere, brilliantine, nun's veiling,
velveteen, camel's hair and ladies*
cloth are all appropriate materials for
cloaks. And for comfort and conveni
ence's sake they are lined with silk
or satin. Accordion plaited China
silk, which is but 39 cents a yard, a
yard wide, makes a most graceful, ef
fective lining.
Of course they must* be interlined
with wadding unless fur is used. ThÂ»
cheapest fur is gray and white squir
rel, but the cheapest makes a cloak
fairly expensive and broche silk or
brocaded satin is much dressier.
The cheapest fur trimming: is lamb
or white astrakhan, or the soft white
hair. And it is very fashionable to
have just a narrow collar of fur.
It is a pretty, artistic idea to have
a slipper bag to match .the lining; but
it can be made of odds and ends of
silk and velvet in harmonious colors,
all of one bit of goods, or of several
fabrics in stripes. Bands of passe
menterie caught together with narrow
velvet ribbon are effective, or lace and
ribbon over a colored lining.
Say, for instance, that your cream
white party cloak is lined with cream
silk having a broche figure in pale pink
and blue, what could be prettier than
a slipper bag of bands of cream coarse
lace insertion held together with
odds of pink satin rlbborv over a tin
ing uf pale blue silk or satin? Or use
both pink and blue ribbon with the
lace and line with cream or black vel
vet if you have it, with pink or blue
and a tinted lining 1 . There are endless
combinations to meet th supplies of
any scrap-box.. t .
First the pieces must be cleaned and
pressed and if the velvet is old It can
be "panned", into freshness and
fashion.. It is better to wash either
satin or silk, as . wrinkles will come
back in' materials that are only de
pressed, and if you sprinkle ribbon and
iron it damp it is sifre to stiffen.
Don't sponge the 'pieces or rub with
gasoline. One way is Inadequate and
the other malodorous. Just regularly
wash them, but in the daintiest; most
esthetic fashion, no boiling or rubbing
or any ordinary, common of " garden
laundry methods.
â¢In a basin of water that has just
come to the boil put half a cup of hot
castile suds and one teaspoon of
dissolved borax. Dip the pieces in one
at a time, run with the lingers on both
sides, and a ; very little rubbing will
clean absolutely, then rinse once in
clear warm water, Clap all the pieces
until partly dry and wind around a
curtain pole. Male sure tl\e/bits are
perfectly smooth and wind tight.
Place the pole, covered with a bit of
old muslin to prevent dust or soil, near
the fire, and leave fur a day or two.

A Blue and White
KitcHen.
The majority of American â¢women
keep their own homes. Many do all
their own â work, and those that do not
have an Intelligent Interest In the man
agement of their homes oversee the
work of a servant and are In and out
of the kitchen many times a day.
This being the case, it naturally fol
lows that the average American kitch
en is growing to be cheerful and pleas
antânot a dingy, ugly spot, the scrap
basket of the house.
The prim- Hew England housekeeper
may have a smile for the thought of a
blue-and-white kitchen, for it does
sound a little elaborate to get up a
color scheme for this busy workroom;
but she would really be the first to ap
preciate the exquisite neatness and es
thetic pleasantness of a delicately
clean, pretty delft kitchen. \
It would be absurd, of course, if ona
has a nice kitchen with stout iron and
fresh tin ware to suggest doing it all
over in a blue-and-white effect, just for
arts sake. But If you're doing a new
kitchen or making over an old one don't
fail to strive for this new, charming
and hygienic effect. Â»
And if your kitchen is old and shab
by then do it over little by little as you

or two , you will find, with only the
necessary outlay, that the room .you
dreaded to work in and that your fam
ily avoided if possible has grown an in
viting spot, cheerful and wholesome.
Of course, your delft effects are not
real, and you don't get imported wind
mill china and placques, and blue and
white tiled stoves and cupboards: but
you get floor and table ; oilcloths -in
blue-and-white designs for not. a: - cent
more than ugly colors cost. And you
cover your walls with blue-and-white
imitation tile paper, which is very
cheap, and you put white dotted Swiss
curtains at ' the window â very * plain
ones, without a ruffle or plait and hung
on cheap brass rods, so that, without
any trouble they*' can be washed at
least once a month. .. , . . M
And the woodwork is painted a clean,
dull green, which fits perfectly with
your colors and is easier to keep clean
than white, and 'the ceiling is pure
white.
AM this costs not one cent more
than the dull, uninteresting colors that
are put in the average kitchen. In
fact, your, paper costs less than.paint
ing the walls, and, if varnished. , will
last years and can be washed.
Now for the utensils and dishes.
There is no heavy crockery, not of the
coarsest ' and cheapest, any cheaper
than heavy modern willow ware,- and
it comes in the prettiest blue and
white. Put it on your cupboard
shelves so that it will show and have
a real old-time open cupboard, *on
which you hang'the cups with the sau.

INDIAN
Wars and FigHters
CYRUS TOWNSEND BRADY
is one of the most prolific â
and alas, often the most
careless â of American writ
ters. Three novels a year,
"with one or two historical works in
terspersed, seems to be about the aver
asje output for this energetic ex-wear
er of the cloth. Necessarily his work
is not usually high class, and Mr.
Brady has only his own predilection
for speed to blame if the reading pub
lic hesitates to place as high a value
upon his work as he himself may do.
In the writing of history, however,
Mr. Brady seems to be more conscien
tious than In his fiction efforts. In
popularizing the dry records of fact he
diapleys a lively style, pictures vividly
Ftirring events and gives a broadly
comprehensive view of his chosen sub
ject which suits admirably the not too
finical taste of the average reader.
His recently published book, "Indian
Fights and Fighters," is perhaps the
best thing in this line that Brady has
done.
The third in a series upon American
fights and fighters, this book continues
the record of colonial, border and
revolutionary wars to the decade Just
after the Civil War when the vast
plains of the West formed the amphi
theater for the stirring drama of In
dian campaigns. Only the first half
of the Indian wars are included in this
volume: those embraced during the
years 1 866-1 b 76 and fought out along
the course of the first transcontinen
tal railroad. In a second book the
author will continue the record of the
Indian wars to include the campaigns
in the Northwest against Chief Joseph
and a third will embody the events of
Apache troubles in the great South
west. A comprehensive scheme this;
end if Mr. Brady gives to the succeed
ing books as thoroughly satisfactory a
character as the first possesses he will
have made complete atonement for
the hurried and insipid novels that
bear his frank.
The author takes up the record of the
stirring times on plain and mountain
â with the establishment in 1866 of Fort
Phiiip Kearney to guard the Bozeman
trail from the Missouri to Montana.
Never, says the author, in the history
of Indian wars has there been a strong
hold 60 persistently beleaguered. Dur
ing the two years of its occupancy by
the small garrison this outpost was
constantly under the surveillance of
hostile war parties, no wagon train
going to or coming from the fort was
immune from attack, every forage or
wood party venturing outside of the
stockade had to be accompanied by an
armed guard and at all times the com
mand delegated to the defense of the
post was inadequate. And terrible
were some of the experiences of this
garrison force. Brady gives with a
vivid pen the details of the annihilation
of Fetterman's command, which,
through the disobedience of orders on
the part of Fetterman, came to fall in
to an Indian ambuscade and there to
meet death almost to a man. Again
there a desperate fight against
overwhelming odds when Major Powell
and thirty-one others from their im
;sed wagon corral on Piney Island
repulsed three thousand Sioux warriors
for the weary length of a whole day.
This is thrilling reading.
For the policy of the Government in
treating with the Indians first as in
dependent nations and then as revolted
subjects and in underestimating the
strength of their resistance Brady has
*some hot censure. He says: "To settle
such a growing question in a word, off
hand, as it were. Is, of course, impos
sible, nor does the settlement lie with
in the province of these articles: but
it may be said that if the United States
had definitely decided upon one policy
or the other, and had then concen
trated all its strength upon the prob
lem; if it had realized the character of
the people with whom it was dealing,
and had made such display of its force
as would have rendered it apparent, to
the keenest as well as to the most
stupid and besotted of the Indians, that
resistance was entirely futile, things
might have been different. But it is
the solemn truth that never, in any
of the Indian wars west of the Mis
souri, has there been a force of soldiers
in the field adequate to deal with the
question."
To this vacillating policy upon the
part of the Government Brady at
tributes in large part the frequent dis
asters and the ever present dangers
shadowing the petty handful of troops
which was grudgingly assigned to
gruard a territory large as the whole of
the then inhabited portion of the United
States.
The disastrous Little Big Horn cam
paign, which was signalized by the en
tire destruction of General Custer's
command and the ignominious routing
of the forces under Major Reno, though
the subject of much controversy and
many partisan writings, is reviewed at
length by Brady. After tracing at
length the course taken by Custer in
pursuance of his superior general's or
ders, the dividing of hie forces in the
hope of surrounding the great encamp
ment of the Indians on the LitUe Big
Horn and the helpless blundering and
incompetence of Reno's command, the
author asserts it to be his belief that
Custer brought on himself the terrible
defeat by hie neglect of orders, prompt
ed in part by a desire to win back by a
single daring stroke the prestige lost
by him in his unfortunate political at
tack against Belknap, Secretary of
War, and also by his trust in the tac
which had won him the signal vic
tory at Washita.
"I have studied the situation care
fully," says Brady, "examining all the
evidence published by both sides, and
very reluctantly, in spite of my liking
for poor Custer I am compelled to ad
mit that he did disobey hie orders; that
his action did break up a most promis
ing plan, which it is highly probable
â¢would have resulted in a decisive battle
with the Indians and the termination
<r war, and that he, and he alone,
must be held responsible for the subse
quent disaster." But for the complete
, ness of Custer's defeat Brady blames
the subordinate who had been ordered
to co-operate with Custer in the at
tack. "I am loth to believe that Major
Reno was a coward," says the author,
"but he certainly lost his head, and
:when he lost his head heloet Custer."

PELEE'S
Volcanic Pinnacle
THOUGH Angelo Heilprin's new
studies of the great volcano of
Martinique, entitled "The Tower
of Pelee," are largely of a technical
nature and designed for geologists' .
reading, there is a great deal of ab
sorbing interest for the layman in his
book. The remarkable phenomenon
therein described, the first of its kind
ever to b% produced by nature, pos
sesses features of wide interest. In
August of 1902 there was suddenly
pushed from the lips of death-dealing
Pelee a vertical needle of rock, which
was propelled upward by subterranean
forces of immeasurable energy at the
rate of twenty to thirty feet a day un
til nearly 1000 feet of this craggy core
of the volcano had been elevated above
the vent. There it remained for a
time, a sinister monument to the souls
of the unfortunates who had perished
before the fiery breath of the moun
tain, and then swiftly it was destroyed,
leaving hardly a vestige of its forma
tion for the enlightenment of the
scientists.
Professor Heilprin of the Sheffield
Scientific School of Yale University,
who had produced as a result of a visit
to Martinique a book, "Mount Pelee
and the Tragedy at Martinique," re
visited the volcano to make scientific
investigations of this remarkable freak
in June, 1902. After many ineffectual
attempts to gain a view of the prodigy,
which was continuously draped with
heavy clouds of vapor, the scientist
was at last rewarded by a revelation
of nature's remarkable handiwork.
Standing one day within a few feet
of the crater's rim, Professor Heilprin
suddenly saw the veil snatched away
from the Pelee tower. Thus he de
scribes the incident:
"Shortly before 2 o'clock the oppor-
tunity for which we had so impatiently
waited seemed finally to arrive. Clouds
and vapors died down to one side and
the great tower, its crown hanging at
a dizzy height above, began to unfold.
Piece by piece was added to it â purple,
brown and gray â until at last it stood
abreast of us, virtually uncovered from
base to summit. 'Look!' I shouted to
my companion, and my words failed
me for the magnificence of the view
that presented itself. The spectacle
v.as one of overwhelming grandeur,
and we stood for some moments awed
and silent in the shadow of this most
impressive of mountain forms.
"Nature's monument dedicated to the
30,000 dead who lay in the silent city
below, it rose up a huge monolith 830
feet above the newly constructed sum
mit of the volcano and 5020 feet above
the Caribbean surfaceâ a unique and
incomparable type in our planet's won
derland. From whichever side seen it
was an object of sublime magnificence,
and in its condition .of vapor clouds
blowing out from its base and from the
cone that supported it, with blue sul
phur smoke curling its way along with
these, it presented a spectacle of almost
overwhelming grandeur and one of ter
rorizing effect which could hardly be
matched anywhere."
Ac to the composition of this tower
and the explanation of its sudden ele
vation from the heart of the volcano
Heilprin takes exception to the findings
of the French Ecientific ' commission
sent to make a study of the phenom
enon. Instead of believing with M. La
croix of this commission that Pelee's
tower was constructed of an active
lava whose viscous state within the
crater of the volcano was such as to
permit of solidification within the cra
ter chimney and consequent extrusion
through the forces of pent-up gases,
the author holds that this spire of. rock
was nothing else than the solid core of
the volcano, forced up and out intact
by volcanic energies. The burnt-out
and slaggy condition of the tower, re
sembling a furnace product more than
recently cooled lava, confirms Heilprin
in his belief.
All this, however, Is for scientists to
thresh over; some of the Intricacies ex
pounded we simple laymen cannot even
follow. The main features of the au
thor's thesis are comprehendable, nev
ertheless, and the twenty odd remark
able photographs illustrating the text,
ROBERT W. RITCHIE
two of which are reproduced on this
page, carry terrible conviction of the
dreadful power of Pelee.

CAREER
of Business Man *.'
w T NDER the Barbara Weinetock
il lectureship on the morals of trade,
established at the University of
California by H. Weinstock of Sacra
mento, Albert Shaw, the editor of Re
view of Reviews, delivered last year the
first lecture. This address upon "The
Business Career," given weight by the
name of such a publicist and student
of present day affairs as Albert Shaw,
well merits the publication Paul Elder
has accorded it. The thin, handsomely
bound volume that comes from the
Tomoye press here in San Francisco
embodies a message of optimistic
promise upon the aims and ideals of
the world of commerce, which every
business man should have on his office
desk.
The dominant note urged by the
lecturer upon men of this hurried age
of business is that of responsibility, of
accountability for all their acts before
the bar of the social organism. Busi
ness, he would have it, is a public serÂ«
vice, whatever may be the private
gain; its end is the development of in
dustrial perfection; its methods must
be those that bring no harm to the pub
lic good. Says Shaw: "If the busi
ness world is not characterized, first, by
public spirit and a sense of public duty
in general, and, second, by the special
and technical sense of public obligation
that pertains to particular kinds or de
partments of business activity, then it
is falling short of its best opportunities
and evading its providential tasks."
It is incumbent upon the business
man to remember that the State,
though in one sense the master of the
people, is fundamentally the agent of
the people and by the people's con
science it is affected directly for good
or for evil. In promoting the purity
and upholding the integrity of political
life, then, lies the mission of the man
of business, for as the affairs of com
merce are conducted, so will the affairs
of state find their governance.
A healthy optimism is reflected from
Shaw's address. For him some of the
least creditable mainfestations of the
business spirit of to-day are but pass
ing phases in the strong development
of the tremendous constructive force of
cpmmerce. The power to give this
force strong impetus in the direction of
right achievement lies with every busi
ness man.

ness of Christmas books he has just
begun to emerge and the list of books
on his shelves still unreviewed dates
back as far as October. Most of these,
as he congratulates himself, have well
borne waiting and their review, even at
this tardy date, will appear as new ma
terial to the majority of readers.
"Doctor Tom," by John Williams
Streeter, for instance, is a book whose
first edition will scarcely be exhausted,
I believe. This because the character
about whom the story is built is as im
probable as anything in recent fiction
and as unconvincing as the hero of the
typical "refined melodrama." The
Coroner of Brett County was too good
for this world, and he died a martyr.
Voluntarily this young physician leaves
a lucrative practice and metropolitan
life to retire to the mountains of the
Middle Southwest, carrying with him
a great light to lighten the unregen
erate Gentiles of the district. Because
the position of Coroner in the county
had been allowed to lapse on account
of the danger in holding inquiries upon
the sudden deaths of feud victims, Doc
tor Tom immediately took the post,
and from that precarious vantage
ground began to set in motion the
forces of love and truth. The unre
ality of the successful and speedy
fruition of his labors is only one of the
unconvincing features of the book. The
incidents of a savage vendetta and the
exploits of a certain wild girl of the
mountains, "Sis Thompson," are the
most realistic things in the book.
(The Macmillan Company, New
York; price $1 50.)
Robert Barr's romantic novel, "A
Chicago Princess," is another uncon
vincing story. In this instance it is the
riotous convolutions of plot incident
that make the thing impossible. The
story deals with the invasion of Korea
by a Chicago pork packing millionaire
and his high spirited and tremendously
resourceful daughter. Since it Is the
desire of this lady to hob-neb at close
range with royalty, and since the King
af Korea seems to present a very acces
.lble mark, this strenuous daughter of
'lillions makes things exceedingly in
eresting for that Oriental potentate.
He replies in kind. Things move dan
gerously near the edge of the abyss for
*>oth the American girl and her doting
papa, but ingenuity of a most remark
able order prevails over the craft and
fanaticism of the East and everything

hundred pages of the most ephemeral
reading. This book should have been

â¢'Hope Hathaway," an idealized cow
girl of the roaring West, takes aim
with a rifle at the reader from the very
cover of her book and is shooting at
desperadoes, coyotes and things
through four hundred pages of light lit
erature. Frances Parker Introduces
her to the public. She is not altogether
an uninteresting person, either, though
one of her genius should obtain a high
salary at shooting glass balls with Col
onel Cody's aggregation of rough rid
ers. The scene of her vivacious doings
is laid on a cattle ranch and an Indian
reservation successively. In both lo
caJities she cuts the wind considerably.
The slang indulged in by both the hero
ine and her compatriots is probably as
unintelligible to the good people of
Montana as that found in the average
story of the woolly West. But then, a
proper dialect is not necessarily a com
ponent part of such tales; most read
ers accept it for the genuine and satis
faction is general. The spirited illus
trations furnished "Hope Hathaway,"
by the pencil of C. M. Russell, add
materially to the book's value.

The historical novel, which seems to
find favor still with so many readers, is
represented by Georgie Tilman Snead's
"Beneath Virginia Skies," a story of
colonial days in the Old Dominion. In
this fanciful tale of love and religious
persecution the heroine asks the hero
to marry her when she is yet 13 years
of age, receives against a New Testa
ment bound to her breast the Indian
arrow meant for her lover and does the
unstereotyped thing generally. The
hero, a dissenting clergyman, quotes
from Scripture overfrequently and
sniffs through his nose at the unregen
erate people of Virginia colony, who
made life such a burden for him. There
have been worse books than "Beneath
Virginia Skies"â also many better ones.

Gelett Burgess has done something
passing clever in his "Rubaiyat of Omar
Cayenne," though appreciation of his
parody must necessarily be confined
closely to those having intimacy with
the several aspects of contemporaneous
literature. While reading this skit,

finds himself in a continuous attitude
of protest against the impious desecra

A special limited edition of a dainty
little monograph entitled "The Watch
Book" has Just been issued by Shreve

The story tells of man's effort to di
vide his hours as he came to realize
the Increasing value of his time, and in
so doing how he progressed from the
use of the clepsydra or machine for
measuring time by running water
through a narorw aperture down to
the sun dial, the hour glass, notches
cut in a lighted candle and finally the
clock, invented by Pope Sylvester in
fr'J6 A. D. Then, alas, came the realiza
tion that although the "Grandfather's
Clock" could run, it could not walk,
and was too heavy to be carried. At
last, however, old Nuremberg, the fa
mous source of so much of artistic in
spiration, gave also mechanical inspira
tion in the shape of the "Nuremberg

And one of those "eggs" is exhibiting

four centuries. Thence on the develop

PEER REFORMED
AND FROM A CAREER OF EXTRAVAGANCE
TURNED TOWARD POLITICAL USEFULNESS
BY HIS SPOUSE
Earl of Essex Chosen Member
of London County Council.
URGED ON BY AMERICAN WIFE
Fair Countess Brought Him Little Money
but Plenty of Brains and Energy.
LONDON. Feb. 4â lf a United States
Senator should seek election to a Board
of Aldermen in any American city it
would be thought that he had fallen
low in the political world. But such
matters are Judged by a different
standard here. When a peer seeks elec
, tion to the London County Councilâ the
central governing body of this huge
metropolis â it* is regarded as evidence
of a commendable desire on his part
to play a useful role in public life.
No less an authority than Lord Rose
bery, who was chairman of the first -
London County Council, declared that '
8 member of that democratic body had
far greater opportunities of rendering
good service to the community than a
rr.ember of the House of Lords. There
; fore when the Right Honorable George
Dfvereux de Vere CapelL Earl of Es
sex, announced his intention of run
r.ipg for the London County Council as .
a representative of the borough of
. I-JaryJebone it was regarded as proof of .
his lordship's desire to . accomplish .
something that should be accounted as .
good v.-ork in a life which heretofore .
has been more conspicuous for private
extravagance than for public service.
Fo his friends warmly congratulated
him on his election. - :
There is no doubt that this salutary
change in Lord Essex has been brought
about bs* the influence of his wife, who j
was formerly Miss Adela- Grant, the
daughter of Beach Grant of New- York.
It is 6aid that the title of Countess of
Essex has been borne invariably by a
beautiful woman, a statement that is
Fbundantly substantiated by the . en
cient airily portraits that adorn the
halls of the family ssat at Cassiobury,
.j.n, Hertfordshire ,: : v.^.^ ; Â«.:^. ->â¢Â'Â» â 
Z FAMED FOB. â¢ HER BEArTY.
The American Lady Essex com- ,
l^are favorably with any of her , pre
decessors of the. noble, house. ; At the
coronation of King Edward she at
tracted great attention as one of the
handsomest women in the stately â 
throng that filled Westminster* Abbey. .
The beauty of her classic features is .
enhanced by what has been described
as a magnolia tinted" complexion.
She has soft eyes, dark hair, a tall
figure and a singularly graceful car
riage. She stands at the head of that
aristocratic group which was playfully
christened by society the "Lovely
Five." the other four being Lady War
wick, Lady Lytton, Lady Westmore- .
land and the Duchess of Sutherland.
It cannot be said with entire truth
of Lady Essex that her "face is her
fortune," but as she once declared, j
â¢with characteristic frankness, "I am
not an American heiress," it may be .
assumed that she did not bring her
husband that Inexhaustible dowry of
dollars which is popularly supposed
to be the price trans- Atlantic brides
Invariably pay for English titles. But :
In addition to beauty, which more â 
than satisfied the demands of the
family .traditions of his house, she ,
brought him brains, energy and en
terprise.

BRITISH MAYOR CLAIMS THE SITE OF CHICAGO

' LONDON. Feb. Recently when
Li^niel Kenry'Kedhead- was elected for

jr.ilcs northwest of London, a para

Chicago ?Etand3 would belong to him,
r.nd that, he be tremendously
j ;ch in c/msequence.
At the outset it should be made plain
how substantial a citizen Daniel Henry
Hcdhead is. Of course^ the fact that
hÂ« is now for the second time the civic
li-.ad of the historic city in which he.
lives ppeaks for, itself, but one finds

days a conspicuously wealthy one. t The '
Earl inherited 15.000 .acre's and. tastes
which demanded more money, to grai
ify than his rent roll 'furnished.,. A's%'' ;
young man' the finishing touches* tot
his education were, obtained in that
sweJlest of all regiments, the Guards,
whose officers are more distinguished
for "going the pace" than for devotion
to those studies which in this age of
scientific warfare are essential to suc
cess in the profession of arms.
The lesson learned in . that 'costly
school he .has not ceased paying foi -"
yet. Of late years there have been
many evidences that his "financial con- .
dition was fast approaching . "hard
pan," coupled with rumors that the
Countess was sorely grieved at his
failure to put a curb on his extrava
gance and settle down to taking life
seriously . Only a few months ago it /
was recorded that he had sold the
richest of the three church" livings to "
which he has the right of appointing
an ' incumbent. And now, because of
his need of ready cash, it is reported
that he taken steps to dispose of his
Irish property to his tenantry. " .
Meanwhile Lady Essex has been set
ting him an example of beneficent ac
tivity which has led many to think that
she is by long odds his better half.
Some time ago she established a model
laundry in one of London's suburbs. It ,
was run on business lines, but it was
relieved from the charge of being.'a
purely money-making speculation by
the fact that it was preceded by a
painstaking personal investigation of ,
sanitary conditions in London laundries ',
which was largely, instrumental In in
ducing the London County Council to '.
adopt measures for, their â¢ reformation.
In otherjiirections she has shown keen 1
practical^ interest' in the condition .at ;\
London's tolling legions. "* â¢ ' â â ?'.' â¢ H ,- *
ins LARGE MAJORITY. / \ \
In view of , the /promise he now gives :
of turning over, a new. leaf and devoting |
himself to a career, of .usefulness, his "
friends are agreed that it is a : good
thing that his wife did not bring him
the. dowry of a multi-millionaire's
daughter. With plenty of money to
spend he would have â¢ escaped 'the '
wholesome check imposed by the need
of retrenchment.
It was generally expected that' the >
Earl of Essex would receive a big ma
jority from the Marylebone, constitu
ency, for the borough has shown itself
peculiarly partial to aristocratic can
didates, one of its districts being al
ready represented on the County Coun
cil by Lord Ludlow. A few days before
the date assigned for the polling an
other candidate appeared in the person
of T. Wheeler, the proprietor of a
small coffee-house. There could hardly
be a better vindication .of England's .
claim to be a democratic country than
the spectacle r afforded of a , "belted
Earl" competing for votes with the
humble purveyor of ; cheap refresh
ments. The nobleman won by a large
majority, . largely due to . the fact that
his opponent was so tardy in entering
the contest against him.
The constitution of the London Coun
ty Council is democratic enough . to

Socialists. Peers and plebeians meet
there on equal ground and the former
get no favors on account of their aris
tocratic lineage. The present chairman
\y Lord Mohkswell, but among the most
influential members are John Burns,
who b. msts that he never wore an
overcoat, and Will Crooks, the Mayur of
Foplar. who lives in a small workman's
cottage and appeared at the gorgeous
banquet of the Lord Mayor in every
day store clothes.
The Earl of Essex joins the Council
a? a member of what is termed the
"Moderate" and at present the minor
ity party. It is supposed to stand for
economy as opposed to the policy of the
dominant "Progressive" party which
goes in wholesale for municipal im
provements and it must be acknowl
edged somewhat regardless of cost.
The Earl, having T learned the neces
sity of economy, should be well quali
fied to assist his colleagues on the
Co-uncil in keeping a tight grip on the
public purse Btrlngs. Anyhow, he will
find opportunities to acquire greater
distinction than he is likely to derive
from the invention of a variation of
croquetâ known as Cassiobury croquet
âwhich thus far constitutes his sole
claim to fame.
Lady Essex, by the way. has recent
ly become a convert to vegetarianism.
That form of diet is said to be pecu

a "magnolia-tinted" complexion.

Chapel for Be<mtv Band.
LONDON. Feb. 4. âUnder the head
ing:. "Manicurists* Chapel, Saintly
Bandlof Bsauty Doctors," a London
morning paper prints a remarkable
story of a manicure establishment
maintained by society women with a
leaning toward high church doctrine,
which has been opened in a fashion
able street off Piccadilly.
"The period I am going to speak- of,"
Redhead began, "was the latter part
ot 1833. or several years before I was
born. Sly parents, who lived in Peter
borough, had been married about two
years. My father, Daniel Redhead,
was a cabinet-maker in a small way.
Aly mother's maiden name was Jane
Sergeant. One of her few living rela
tives was an uncle of the same name,
who, as a boy, had gone to America to
seek his fortune.
One day during the fall of 1833 a let
ter was received from this uncle by
one of his old friends in Peterborough.
It was dated from what was then the

village of Chicago, and was written to
_^k if there were any members of the
Sergeant family who would care to
join him In America. He went on to
say that he was the owner of a con
siderable amount of land at the mouth
of the river on which the village where
he lived was built, and that, as he was
old and unmarried, he was prepared
to bequeath his holdings to any of his
kinsfolk who felt disposed to come out
and keep him company in his declining
years. |
"As my mother was one of the few
remaining members of the Sergeant
family in Peterborough, as well as her
uncle's next of kin. his letter was im
mediately handed over to her, and
from the first she was anxious to go
to the United States. Several reasons,
however, made my father hesitate,
among them the fact that my elder sis
ter, now dead, was then so young; but
my mother was a woman of enterprise
and determination, and she finally per
suaded my father to go.
"They left Peterborough in 1834, and
after all sorts of hardships, encounter
ed by sea and land, they finally reached
the village of Chicago in something
like six months from the date of start
ing. They passed through regions
swarming with Indians, and were in a
state bordering on complete exhaustion
before they got to their destination,
only to be confronted, after all, with
a terrible disappointment; for on ar
riving at my uncle's house they found
Pages! 7 to 26
that the old man had died a few weeks
previously without leaving a will."
The story of these happenings wan
told to the present MayÂ«r of Peter
borough by his mother many years
after they occurred, and at the time
he was too young to really grasp the
importance of all her statements. A*s
has been said, his sister was tlv
mereÃt child when she arrived with her
parents in Chicago and never was able
to give him much information of value.
So Redhead is the first to admit that
he is quite ignorant regarding many
ppints that would be of immense im
portance in establishing any definite
claim.
His parents were unable to get pos
session of their uncle's property, but
Redhead says that his mother was al
ways most definite in declaring that
this was not because of any doubt
that their relative had been possessed
of quite as much real estate as he hat
stated in his letter. The difficulty was
to prove that they were the next Â«f kin.
There was no question. Mrs. Redhead
told her son. that a great part of the
land upon which the town of Chicago
stood had been staked out originally
and held on to afterward by Sergeant.
He appeared to have been one of the
most enterprising of the early settlers
and seemed to have got along better
with the Indians than most ct the
white men in the region. He was about
65 years of age when he died.
"My mother told me," continue*' Red
head. "that, in spite- of the' letter In
their, possession they were looked upon t
'with' a 'good deal of "suspicion,- and al
though' they 'met many people who had
been intimately acquainted .with her
uncle/, there â  was' a general disposition '
â¢to withhold information regarding ! his
business affairs. .The men 'who were
found in "charge of : his dwelling would
: give no information, statins? that they
were public officials and had authority

tance away from the town. It was, my
'mother has told me, a ; large rambling
tort of place, and appeared to have

- My father ; and mother were ad
vised," Redhead went on. "that they
stood a good chance, of ultimately ob
taining their inheritance, - but that it
would â¢he only after a long and costly
process at law. Unfortunately, they had
no means for that purpose. In fact, it
was a case of getting bread and butter,
and â¢ when â  a Â» few weeks after the,ir ar- .
rival in Chicago my father was offered
a. chance to work at 'his trade of cabi

I met Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch for the
second time this week. The first time
tost me Just $36 70, a commutation
ticket, a recipe for oyster salad and a
*ew other pocketbook fripperies. It
was quite Mr. Dolmetsch's fault. It
was In the days when I lived In Oak
landâin that, of course, one was culp
able â and had Just* laid hands on
Evelyn Inness." It was between Its
covers that I met Arnold Dolmetschâ
not to speak of Melba, who will also be
here this week. Inness, the quaint old
figure among his viols and harpsi
chords, his Palaestrina and Monte
verde, lost me one boat to begin with.
However, I managed to get the next,
and as far as possible from the Band
was soon deep among the madrigals
again. I forgot everything else. The
purpled, faded, lost Itself; Goat
Island loomed and paled, Oakland up-
Elittered, the crowd crushed off the
boat, I with it, still with my nose in
the book. It was the other person
that kindly took charge of my purse.
And that Is why I rather felt that I
knew Mr. Dolmetsch, who as every one
knows is the original of Inness. Was
the original as fascinating as the por
trait, I wondered as 1 went Into Lyric
Hall to meet him? How near to life
iad the novelist dared to draw? It
was at any rate not at all the outside
Inness that locked down at me as I
reached the platform. You would give
Mr. Dolmetsch perhaps forty-two or
Three years, haply not more than thir

beard, and a heavy sweep of black
hair covering the brow. It is a face
oould not possibly escape. A
painter, rather than a musician, It
somehow suggests, but it is exquisitely

The audacious red of the tie helped it
delightfully, and the careless blue serge

nietsch was at the harpsichord as I
up, and I found, as he stood to
-r*Â»et Tr.f, that there was not more than
bet two or three of the man that
has done more for the ancient faith of
ke than any other living person.
â V.'.-11, this is Mr. Inness at last," I
shook hands.
Dolmetsch emiled and owned
that he had sat for the figure. I asked
him then if George Moore were not
r an impertinent person, and if

is into his books, and if Mr. Dol
â cfc had minded?
no, I didn't mind," and Mr. Dol
metsch's shrug and smile asked why
d he? "In fact," he added. "I
wrote part of it"
"Oh:" I contributed.
"That Is," he explained, "some of the
musical descriptions. It was odd how
â¢ I came to know Moore â you care to
hcÂ£r?" I did indeed.
Then, sitting by the virginals, to

Mr. Dolmetsch told me. He
was dining at an old London tavern
where artists congregate and some
friend of his came in with a tall, lank
â¢ hap that nobody seemed to know â
was before Moore became famous.
They came to the Dolmetsch table, and
ungainly stranger began to talk
â jr about the harpsichord. He said
that the friend had invited him to at
fome of the Dolmetsch aJTalrs and
lie had refused. He intimated
any one could take a harpsichord,
Â» upon it and draw a crowd, but
that that was freakism not art. Then
said Mr. Dolmetsch: "You know noth
ing about it!" He stayed at the tavern
a large part of the night explaining to
Mr. Moore a few of the things he did
-.now about it. A day or two later
came a note from Moore saying th^it he
"was much struck by what Mr. Dol
metsch had said; might hÂ«> come to
hear him play"'' Well, "Dowlands,"

Dolmetsch cottage at Dulwich, and

something of a thin, stringy tinkle â
seemed a little to hurt the musician. It
was as though I had doubted the
beauty of a favorite child.
"That is not the kind of virginals I
have heard before." I stammered.
As though speaking of a Raphael re
stored by a tinker. Mr. Dolmetsch then
explained that the virginals one has
heard before have mostly been restored
by the ordinary pianoforte repairer.
He himself has restored his own in
struments.
â¢That is where I have such advan
tage," he went on, "I am a workman
first. 1 used to be in my grandfather's
organ factory before I played. I can
make any part of the instruments, you
knowâ have even made a whole grand
piano â though, of course, a piano is not
a musical Instrument," he amazingly
tacked on.
â¢ What is it?" I gasped.
"Just a machine," Mr. Dolmetsch
put it. "But these" â he touched lov
ingly the keys, then walked over to
caress the harpischord, "these are in
struments. It is such a mistake," he
struck out, "for people to call the
pianoforte a development of the harp
sichord. Cristoforo, who made it first,
claims it strictly as an invention. So
it was. Look at the differenceâ your
string in the harpsichord, in the vir
ginals, is pluckedâ they are both sim
ply harps played upon by keyboards.
In the pianoforte the string is ham
meredâhammered." he repeated, "and
because one could hammer and make a
great noise on It the piano superseded
the harpsichord. Look here," and he
pointed out the delicately-poised, un
âtush! tush! no namesâ suspicious
enough to suggest that the dealer kept
it. It will remain for the court to tell
usâ if he can and will. However, this is
an old. old story.
.The dealer appears to be as necessary
to the artist as the commission man is
to the dairyman, and it must remain
with the artistâ and the public, tooâ to
discriminate between the dealers â that
is. if there be a basis of discrimination,
and many of us think there is. "Legiti
mate commission only" is the cry of the
artists, who claim that the exorbitant
prices put upon their pictures by de.a.l
ers in order to satisfy their greed re
sults In many good pictures remaining
unsold.
On the other hand, the dealers
say that the artists would starve but
for themâ that they give them pub
licity, a fit setting for their work and
an audience, all of which is of invalu
able service to the picture makers, say
they. And thus the matter stands.
Whether the erudite Judge can adjust
the relation remains to be seen. Long

"What would happen if you ham
mered those? They would break. And
listen."
Then he showed me the extreme sen
sitiveness of response to the touch, and
in the clavichord later, how one ac
tually may, by a vibration of pressure
upon the key, produce a crescendo on
the note after it has been put down.
But that was after I had admired the
fine, lacquered case of the harpsichord
made in Paris in 1764, but indistin
guishable now even by experts from
the finest Chinese. The musical part
of the instrument, he told me, was old
Flemish, and made in 1640.
After that we left the hall to call
upon Mrs. Dolmetsch, a door or two
away. On the way I asked Mr. Dol
metsch about his studies. Ho was,
it seems, the last pupil of Vieuxtemps.
That was. of course, for violin. He
plays now the virginals, the harpsi
chord, the lute â with its nineteen
strings â the viola da gainba, the viola
d'amour and the clavichord â these I
remember. There are several that I
do not. And to think of the fuss in
the quartet when the viola falls out!
There isn't a fiddler in fifty that can .
even bluff through an andante on It!
And this was Mrs. Dolmetsch, the

out to us a firm, small hand. Mrs.
Dolmetsch was Mr. Dolmetsch's last
violin pupil, he and she told me. Aft

A busy little woman is Ada Romer
Shawhan, up in her eyrie at 997 Mar

artist-quarter. Perhaps, that's why
she works so well â and so seriously.
This Latin quarter of ours is getting
quite too gay for serious work. If you
don't believe it, ask a few men who
inhabit the lower end of Montgomery
street. And the gayeties are not of
Saturday's making, either, for that's
the artist's day to play. It's the other
days that are laughed away.
Mrs. Shawhan has Just completed the
accompanying character sketch, which
she calls "A Minute's Symphony."
Strong in treatment, and full of feel
ningâas is all of this clever young wor

laughed at his organ story.
I had asked if Mr. Dolmetsch owned
an old organâ for Bach.
"Once I had one," he told me, "hut
some onÂ«k.offered me a large sum for
itâ and there were some manuscripts
there are' always manuscripts, you
know â "
And Mrs. Dolmetsoh laughed. Her
husband explained that he could not
have money and manuscripts too, and
one had to have manuscripts â and Mrs.
Dolmetsch laughed. I think it was she
that brought over to me a book of
Rarneau, exquisitely made, the page

curled down on the rug on one side of
my chair, Mr. Dolmetsch curled down
on the other, and so we admired the
book.

me," the musician put it, "before the
pre-Raphaelite movement."
"And what the pre-Raphaelite move
ment did for painting, is it your hope,
belief, that your revival of ancient
music may do for music?"
"One hopes something of the kind,"
Mr. Dolmetsch owned.
Then he made a plea for the purity
and simplicity of the older musicâ for
its genuineness, for its spontaneous
character. He told me interestingly
that the people that most enjoyed It
are the working folk, who bring to It
the unspoiled ear, and then the most
utterly sophisticated listener. Bernard
Shaw is a great believer, and William
Morris â yes, one must find space for
this. Morris, artist, socialist, cabinet
maker, bookbinder, poet, novelist, was
artist in everything but music. He
not only did not enjoy it nor
understand it, but disliked it.
One day he heard Mr. Dolmetsch
play. It was the harpsichord first,
and Byrd and Purcell. Morris listen
ed, minute after minute, then burst
out crying. He said: "That is the
music I have been wanting all my life."
He was faithful to the new-found art
until his death. Two or three days be

ris had sai-J that he had just one wish

Dolmetsch took the virginals with him
and for an hour and a half he played
to his dying friend.
"You must be glad to remember
that," I said
"l remember nothing more gladly,"
said the musician. Mrs. Dolmetsch
looked her shared gladness.

by Dr. Genthe are in a class all their
ownâ they have as much "art sense" as
paintings or etchings, or water colors â

photographs of the Alhambra is this
especially true. They are surely ex

Slgnor Polacco says that we hays

company and they should be at ease
therein.

company owns neither a Gregorettl.
whose Girard was a really noble fig
ure, nor an Agostinl, who was emi

there is Berllndi, and she makes up
for a good deal. The opera itself Is
charming. As a drama â every one
knows its subject Is the French rev
olution â It is one of the best ever set
to music. The trial scene well com
pares with that in "The Only Way"
In dramatic intensity.
The music again is most charming
and immediate in its appeal. It is far
more melodious than most, perhaps
any, of the modern Italian operas, and
very happily illumines the emotional
scheme. Prettlness Itself Is the set
ting of the first act, with its flowery
old French minuet, suggesting admir
ably the aristocratic atmosphere. But
through it one hears the herald of
the coming terror and on until In the
brilliant climax of the third act the
revolutionary atmosphere grows in

The second act. of course, begrins with
at terrible tempest. The High Priest,
wily person, understands Just what has
caused it, and hauls up the recreant
lovers before the people. They are con
demned to die. Zurga then is summoned.
Zurga is chief by choice of the people.
by the way, and he a3ks them, "Am I
your chief or not? If I am, I ana your
master. Release these people." They
are released. But Zurga has not yet
seen the lady's face. She is still veiled.
The priest, however, tears off the veiL
Zurga then recognizes her, and driven
by Jealousy and rage at his friend's
treachery condemns the lovers anew to
death.
The tent of Zurga is the first scene
of the third act. He is consumed with
grief. To him comes Leila, asking that
Nadir may be allowed tio go free and
that one may die. Zurga, who has been
plotting to free the lovers, forgets his
grief In Jealousy. He refuses. Then
Leila as she goes out gives a necklace
of pearls to a servant asking that it
may be restored to her mother after
her death. Zurga then recognizes the
necklace as one that he had given to a
child of a neighboring tribe that had
sheltered him from the attacks of her
own people. It was Leila. Tha second
scene of the act shows the forest, with
the sacrificial fire In the distance. Zurga
has relented. To save the lovers hÂ»
has had the funeral fires made far in
the forest, and tells the people that
then* houses are in danger of burning.
They rush to save them, and Zurga
cuts the bonds of Nadir and Leila. He
remains behind to satisfy in his own
person the vengeance of his peoDle.

THE "QUADRILLE IN GOTHAM"
If you would be smart, have the
quadrille at your next dance. You
must! You must!
A quadrille? My dear little de
butante, ask your mother about
it, or your grandmother, if she
be not a Puritan. The quadrille and
its lineal descendant, the lancers, are
danced now at the very smart func
tions in New York, from which we
import our social diversions, even as
we do our millinery from Paris. And
who do you suppose was the first to
revivify the ancient institution of
"square dancing?" None other than
Mrs. John Jacob Astor, at her last
royal ball, at which she presided in
purple velvet and gold and wearing
a bucketful of diamonds. And then
came Mrs. Elbridge Gerry, who gave
a ball of wonderful splendor. She.
too, introduced the old time dances,
and right merrily were they executed.
You mother will tell you that there's
loads more fun â yes, and grace â in
the quadrilles than in the twostep and
the dizzy waltz. Try it. little maids,
and you'll see. Besides being good
fun, the "square dances" have al
ways enjoyed the beatification of the
etiff-backed clergy. While condemn
ing the "round dances" as the "dance
of death." the quadrilles and their
progeny escaped. Perhaps that's the
reason they dropped out; the forbid
den thing is ofttimes alluring.
And there's another fact in favor
of the resuscitation of th^ old danee â
the ease with which it Is executed. In
the maneuvers of the figures there's
always a resting time and a wee bit
of time to chat. The time to rest and
catch a breath is surely a boon, as
witness the gasping maids, and
worse gasping matrons who have
grown to Plumpness, after a waltz or
a twostep. Who shall be first to in
troduce the quadrille? How long
shall we lag behind the smart folk
of Gotham?

have never met. In this correspond

consistently ardent and persistent,
but apparently he haa been lacking in
that courage which counta for so

CHARLES MAIN LOSES HIS
SUIT AGAINST T. R. HAVES
Judge Seawell Holds That Evidence'
Did Not Show Cement Stock Was
Given as Bonus.
Judge Seawell yesterday morning
decided that Charles Main had failed
to prove his case in the suit against
Thomas R. Hayes for the recovery of
$40,000 worth of stock of the Stand
ard Portland Cement Company. Hayes
for fifty-one years was employed by
the firm of Main & Winchester and for
a large part of the period was Main's
confidential agent, in which capacity
he made investments for the aged
merchant. During the latter's absence
in the East Hayes bought $20,000
worth of the cement company's bonds
for Main. Later Main alleged that
he had discovered that 600 shares of
the company's stock had been given
as a bonus with the bonds. Hayes and
his son Charles, now dead, had pos
session of the shares and Main claim
ed them. In the trial it was shown
that the bonds were sold through the
firm of Henshaw & Dingee, by whom
the younger Hayes was employed. W.
G. Henshaw, 1 who made the sale, was
absent during the trial and there was
no evidence by any one else to show
that the stock had been given as a
bonus.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1905..
FINN IS FIRE
COMMISSIONER
Supervisor Is Shifted, but
Appointment of Devoto to
Succeed Him Is Delayed
LEGAL POINTS INVOLVED
Major and Ruef Look Up Au
thorities Relative to Ob
stacles in Charter Clause
Mayor Schmltz yesterday formally
announced the appointment of Super
visor Thomas Finn as Fire Commis
sioner to succeed J. G. Boyne, trans
ferred to the Police Board secretary
ship. Finn had previously filed his res
ignation as Supervisor with the Mayor.
Shortly after making the appointment
the Mayor was closeted with Abe Ruef
and Election Commissioner James A.
Devoto for the purpose of discussing
the selection of a successor to Finn.
Ruef himself, whom the Mayor would
like to have champion his cause on
the Board of Supervisors, firmly de
clined to accept the appointment on
account of pressure of other business.
The legal obstacles in the way of ap
pointing Election Commissioner Devoto
as a Supervisor were looked up in view
of the charter provision prohibiting
such an appointment within one year
after the expiration of his term.
It was realized that the Board of Su
pervisors would refuse to allow Devoto
to be seated under the prevision named.
Then again it was also ascertained that
the only way in which Devoto's seat as
Supervisor could be contested would be
by quo warranto proceedings by per
mission of the Attorney General, who
it was thought would decline to consent
to the proceedings and allow the Su
pervisors to do Democratic politics.
Many authorities were looked up and
while no conclusion was arrived at it
was practically decided to take a
chance and appoint Devoto Supervisor
to-morrow.
Alexander O'Grady will be appointed
Election Commissioner to succeed De
voto, although no official announcement
to that effect was made by the Mayor.
A TRAVELER'S EXPERIENCE.
A party of gentlemen were gathered in
the lobby of a leading hotel the other
evening when an argument arose as to
what Red Raven really is. One gentle
man, who was traveling for a big house
in Indianapolis, ventured the assertion
that notwithstanding the extensive ad
vertising, out of five in the party not
three could tell what Red Raven is. and
to what uses it is put. When the matter
was put to a test it was found that the
Indianapolis man had lost, for not only
did they all know what Red Raven was,
but all used it regularly. As one of the
men said:
"I have found, when traveling from
place to place, taking my meals at dif
ferent hours, sometimes on tfie train and
sometimes at the hotel, that my system
became deranged, resulting in a sluggish
liver, dizziness in the morning, lassitude
and loss of>appetite. I had seen the ad
vertisements of Red Raven, and chanced
to ask a druggist friend of mine what it
meant. You can imagine my surprise at
finding Red Raven was the remedy par
excellence, for just such a disorder as I
was sufteringg from. I tried a bottle be
fore breakfast the next morning and
found prompt relief. I learned that they
kept it not only at the drug stores, but
at any cafe or hotel, and since then in all
my travels, when suffering from head
aches, indigestion or nausea. I have been
promptly relieved by Red Raven." â¢

Seeks Custody of Child.
Mrs. Frederica Salmon, who on Fri
day sued H. L. Salmon, a prominent
citizen of Victoria, B. C, for divorce

secreting- two of her children, yester
day appeared In Judge Hebbard's
court in response to her husband's ap
plication for a writ of habeas corpus
to gain possession of his youngest I
child, Pauline, three and a half years
old. It was shown that there had
been no return of service of the writ
and the court continued the hearing
until next Tuesday. In his affidavit
Salmon charged that his wife left
their home in Victoria in December,
1903, taking the child with her, and
that the little one Is restrained of its
liberty at 643 Hyde street, where, he
says, the mother is breaking her mar
riage vows with one Lyman Hall.

yesterday in the Recorder's office,
wherein Knut Ulsaker, a laborer, liv
ing at 3924 Army street, applies to W.
L. Harper for a loan of $100. Ulsaker
agrees to pay Interest at the rate of
5 per cent per month upon a mort

ff-et on the west line of Kosciusko

various expenses described If the loan
la negotiated. The agreement is

room at 10 Marshall Square, opposite
the City Hall, was rewarded by the
capture of six men, who were anxious

MANY TO LOSE
THEIR PLACES
Works Board Forced to Ee
trench in the Paving and
Sewer Repair Departments
MONEY IS EUNNING LOW
Supervisors Will Be Asked
to Appropriate $40,000 for
Work Absolutely Eequired
The Board of Public Works yesterday
decided to make wholesale removals in
the paving and sewer building depart
ments of the Bureau of Streets owing
to Inadequacy of funds for the purposes
named. The retrenchment will result
in a practical cessation of basalt block
paving and repairs to sewers for the
next five months.
The saving of the funds now available
will be effected by the dismissal of two
foremen, one hydrant man, four sewer
cleaners, twenty laborers, one hod car
rier and the men driving four double
teams and one single team in the sew
er repair department. This will result
In a saving of $109 per day. The board
will then be enabled to spend only
$239 50 per day, instead of $349 as here
tofore. There remains but $10,781 in the
sewer repair fund at the present time.
In the paving department there will
be dismised five pavers, five rammers,
four laborers, two single teams and two
double teams, effecting a saving of $77
per day. There Is $14,760 remaining In
the fund.
Commissioner Maestrettl says there
are now ninety-six barricades in vari
ous portions of the city covering breaks
in the streets and sewers. It is more
than likely that these barricades must
remain ud till next July, as It will be
impossible to make the repairs now.
The board was obliged to expend $10,000
for an extraordinary break at the foot
of Fillmore street and $600 for one on
Tennessee street. These explain the
paucity of the funds. Then, Maestretti
says, only $85,000 was allowed by the
Supervisors for sewer reconstruction,
whereas the Board of Works asked for
$175,000. He says that much work had
been allowed to accumulate in the last
two months of the fiscal year 1903-1904.
This had to be met out of the funds of
the present fiscal year, thus further re
ducing the appropriation.
The Board of Works will adopt a
resolution asking the Board of Super
visors to appropriate $40,000 out of an
expected surplus fund to do urgent re- >
pair work on sewers at once. .
Eppingers and Demings Arraigned.
Jacob, Herman and Josua Eppinger
and James Demings were arraigned
btfore Judge Lawior yesterday on the
two indictments charging them with
obtaining money by false pretenses.
The cases were continued till February
17 to be set. Attorney James H. Budd
announced that he would at that time
file a motion to set aside the Indict
ments against Jarob and Herman Ep
pinger on the grounds of bias and pre
judice on the part of the grand jurors.
The attorneys for the other two de
fendants made a similar announce
ment.
Police Search for Swindler.
The police are searching for A. L.
Brunner, who called at 437% O'Farrell
street on Tuesday morning, represent
ing that he came from the District At
torney's office, and collected $25 to be
used as transportation for bringing a
prisoner to the city. He is described
as between 30 and 35 years of age,
5 feet 7 inches tall, dark complexion,
freckled face, coal black hair and
black mustache.

The
baldheaded

Bald-headed men harÂ«
long been a standing
joke in every theater-
going community, but
nevertheless the loss of
the hair and the unsightly
condition which it impose*
upon the unfortunates who
compose the baldheaded
row is often a source of
keen mortification.
The baldheaded row,
however, will speedily
become practically a thing
of the past, because the
more Coke Dandruff Cure it
used the more it proves
itself capable of positively
growing hair on b%Jd head*,
a claim which was not
originally made by the
inventor. The formula, m
originally evolved, was
intended only to eradicate
and cure conditions of
dandruff and diseases of
the scalp, but to the
surprise and delight of
constant users, it quickly
demonstrated its ability to
restore the hair follicles 10
their youthful vigor and
thereby produce a gloser
and luxuriant growth of
hair.
Thousands of people

truth of this. You don't

OFFICIAL PROCEDURE.
THE country need not be startled to learn that bluff and grizzled
Uncle Joe Cannon, Speaker of the House, has declined an invita
tion to the Supreme Court dinner at the White House, because
â  <*eat at the table would be below the official salt, and he would
not have precedence over the Chief Justice. These questions of
precedence have kept the social pot boiling in the national capital
lor more than a century. Official etiquette first appeared as a dis
quieting influence in the young republic in the discussion of a title
hich to address the President. Washington was President and
seems to have taken some part in the affair. Many titles were sug
gested, running from "His High Mightiness to "His Excellency,"
ar.d there exists some evidence that Washington preferred the for
mer.
Just how narrow an escape we had from being compelled to ad
the executive as "Your High Mightiness" is not generally
known. Jefferson was Secretary of State and many of these ques
nons of form, ceremony and title went to his department for decision.
Out of it all issued the simple form of addressing the chief of the
nation as "The President" and "Mr. President/ Many persist in
using "His Excellency," not only as the Presidential address but as
that of Governors of States. It is bad form in all cases except in
addressing the Governor of Massachusetts, whose constitutional title
: c "His Excellency." After this difficulty over the President's title
was disposed of the question of precedence came to the front, and
has persisted unto this day.
There are set and formal official receptions and dinners. Last
year, at the reception of the Supreme Court, the members of the
diplomatic corps were given precedence and took the right of the
line. The result was the highest judicial dudgeon ever seen in
"Washington. Some of the grave Justices of the court were inter-
Mewed by the press, and gave out opinions not flattering to the
rraiitr morum of the White House.
Precedence is the bete noire of every President. In Cleveland's
rime the storm center was the place and position of the Vice Presi
dent. It went unsettled, and passed over as a heritage of affliction
icKinley. He seems to have adjusted it as a domestic affair,
then it broke out in acute form as an international issue. At a
state dinner Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Embassador. claimed
precedence over Mr. Hobart, the Vice President. The result was
acute indigestion for all concerned. Sir Julian refused to sit down
at all. and went back to the British Legation and fed on a cold
Â«nack of pickups. The House and Senate are always at war in the
matter.
The Senate claims social preference because its members are
cd for six years. Then the members of the Supreme Court
crnt the torch of contention at that flame of tenure, and claim every
because they are appointed for life. Then the House retorts
this claim logically puts them ahead of the President, whose
â r-m:re is only four years. In the kaleidoscopic chaos of the subject
'ia\e grown g~ay trying to make a settlement satisfactory to
body. It would seem that the President, remembering last !
battle between law and diplomacy, has concluded to give the
â¢tic Court a consolation stakes, by asking the Chief Justice and
ieH estoa dinner at which the court sits up head.
Now Uncle Joe Cannon does not care a picturesque imprecation
Stall he stands in to feed and drink. Personally lie is imper- i
ill such considerations. Given his dinner and a chew of
tobacco and a place to spit, he can be happy anywhere. So the j
country must not think that he has grown dudish in the Speaker's
chair because he refuses to sit below the Chief Justice at a dinner to
â urt. As Speaker he has the dignity of the House to sustain, j
DOt Joe Cannon playing second knife and fork to the Chief
Justice. It is the embodiment of the power, prerogative, precedence
and position of the House of Representatives that is asked to go
sway back and sit down, and refuses. The President has a deal of
non his side. He asks the court to a formal dinner. The court !
guest of honor, and he feels that it should, as such, enjoy pre- j
'-c over even-body else. But Uncle Joe. while doubtless heartily
riamning all matters of official etiquette, has to stand by the House, ;
even unto the loss of a fine dinner.
It is strange that none of the pestered Presidents has ever i
thought of a round table in the state dining-room to settle a lot of
these questions of who shall sit below whom. Around the big round
tables in the Bohemian and Pacific-Union clubs in this city dinner
parties gather, made up of city. State and Federal officials, "and offi
cers of the army and navy and of the militia, and precedence rankles
in no bosom and disorders no digestion. Every man is at the head
of the table. We beg to suggest that the controversy of a hundred
years in Washington have a round table tried on it.
MORTALITY IN JAPAN'S ARMIES.
NOT the least notable manifestation of strength which has been
exhibited by the Japanese armies operating in the field is that
developed by their commissary and hospital service. A recent
dispatch from General Oku's headquarters sums up in tellirg fashion
ihe results of the work done by this latter branch of the service
since the beginning of land operations on May 6. Of 24,642 cases
nf disease treated by the Japanese army surgeons and nurses during
the months since the landing of Oku's army forty only have resulted
fatally, 18,578 patients resumed their positions on the fighting line
and 5609 were sent back to Japan for slower convalescence. Sixteen
per cent only of the wounded died, 19 per cent recovered on the field
and 65 per cent were sent back to the large hospitals at home for ulti
mate recovery.
In the six weeks' fighting that marked the land operations of
United States troops against Spain the relation of mortality by
disease to death by bullets was as fourteen to one. The records of
the fight at Guantanamo tell of an utter lacking in medical supplies
and first aid appliances. The hospitals at Siboney were shunned as
plague spots by even the wounded and the trenches before Santiago
were a greater prey to disease than ever to Mauser bullets. Nor do
the annals of the Boer war present a cleaner slate for Britain's edi
fication ; the startling report of the committee on investigation of
army methods during that affair was not of such nature as to bring
any great degree of comfort to the English heart.
Japan is the first nation to demonstrate how the greatest econ
omy comes through the greatest efficiency of the hospital and com
missariat. A soldier kept in the pink of health by the latter depart
ment needs little attention from the former even though wounded. A
man saved is indeed a man earned. The Japanese know how to save
him.
REVIVING OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
IK reporting to the House the bill agreed upon by the Merchant
Marine Commission and recommended favorably by the House
Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, Chairman Gros
venor called the attention of the House to the lamentable condition
of the American merchant marine as set forth in the extended report
of the commission. Self-protection is the keynote of the urgent plea
for a larger merchant marine, as set forth both by the report and by
the personal admonition of Grosvenor. A comparison of our trade
in only one quarter with that of rival nations shipping in their own
bottoms is in itself sufficient argument in support of the measures
now before Congress for the Federal encouragement of a home mer
chant fleet.
In the matter of South American trade, for example, manufac
turers testified before the commission that they found it hard work
to get into South American markets and harder work to stay there,
for the reason that, being dependent entirely upon British and Ger
man freight tramps for the transportation of their goods, they were
subject to delays, the miscarriage of their goods and general con

CARTON'S FIRST
FARE
JAMES ANDERSON
rOR the third time a coachman
called to Carton to move along,
that others might drive up to the
curb, and with a muttered ex
pression of disgust at the length
of time It took Fred Howell to select
a cigar, Hugh Carton ran his auto
mobile across the street and fell in
i line behind two other cars drawn up
j besitle the square. He did not notice
! that the others belonged to a sight
seeing company until a musical voice
inquired what his terms were.
Carton looked down into the face
of an exceedingly pretty girl and
flashed a glance at the cars ahead. In
an instant he comprehended the situa-
I tion. "Dollar an hour," he said
gruffly, touching his leather cap with
what he congratulated hfmself was
a good Imitation of a chauffeur's
! salute.
"I shall want you about three
hours," she said simply, and waited
i while he sprang down and opened the
> door in the back of the tonneau. In
! another moment they were speeding
r up the street.
From the corner of his eye he
i caught a glimpse of Fred Howell
i standing on the hotel stairs and his
i conscience smote him. He had prom
ised Howell a run, but still it was not
his fault that it took his friend so long
: to pick out-cigars while he remained
: outside to be tempted by the prettiest
! girl he had ever seen.
He could take Howell out at any
time. This was his one chance with
the pretty girl. Perhaps after a while
he could tell her that he was not a
| professional chauffeur. Before they
â  had gone half a mile he had built an
air castle in which his first fare was
â  established as chatelaine, and then
suddenly his fare wrecked his castle.
"Turn down the next street to 274,"
she ordered, and obediently Carton
drew up. "I want to send my mother
out for a drive." she said sweetly.
"Give her a good view of the city and
keep the rest for yourself.".
She ran up the steps, while Carton
stared blankly at the five dollar bill
she had thrust into his hand. For a
moment he was tempted to follow her
â  up the steps, give the money to a ser
! vant and drive off. Then came the
i comforting reflection that perhaps it
I might be easier to establish himself
: with the mother than with the daugh
ter. and he waited.
A few moments later he was sorry
he had not done so, for down the steps
came one of the most eccentric figures
he had ever seen. Her clothes bore
the stamp of seasons gone before, and
a hideous blue veil screened a face
: sharp and angular.
She fixed herself comfortably in the
seat, and with a querulous "Don't go
too fast, young man," they started.
It was torture to Hugh to skim
through the residential district with
this old figure in the tonneau. and
more than one surprised glance fol
i lowed the automobile and the oddly as
sorted pair. Even the hope of being
able to win the old lady's favor van
ished when, after several attempts to
engage her in conversation, she leaned
forward and in her high-pitched voice
said: "It's no use to talk to me, young
. man, I'm deaf, and I wish you would
â¢ not turn round: you make me nervous;
you can't see where you are going."
He heaved a sigh of relief when at
1 last he deposited her before her own
door and was free to escape. He did
not even catch a glimpse of the girl
who had lured him to his fate.
Tt was late when he entered the How
ells' drawing-room that evening. The
butler was just announcing dinner,
and there was barely time to make hur
ried greeting to his hostess and offer
, his arm to his companion for the din
; ner.
Before each plate on the lonpr table
stood a characteristic favor, and the
laughter was long and loud when he
picked up the tiny silver and gilt cigar
ette holder fashioned in the form of an
automobile that stood at his place
The laughter became a shriek when,
on lifting the ':d. he discovered a five
dollqr bill in stage money.
As bravely as he could he faced the
storm of laughter and jeering remarks
which followed, but not until ho caught
| sia:ht of Howell at the other end of the
: table, fairly convulsed with mirth, did
fusion owing to the fact that the carrying agents reserved the best
of their ships for direct trade and gave American customers only
second shift. As a consequence Brazil. Argentina and the west coast
gauntries of the south go by our doors and buy of the European
nations that transport their goods under their own commercial flags.
In 1894 the United States shipped $13,000,000 worth of goods to
Brazil; in 1903 only $10,000,000 worth. Yet at the same time our
trade with Canada and Mexico over direct rail routes increased over
threefold.
"Our bill (for the encouragement of the merchant marine) has
already stirred the sluggish blood in our foreign competitors," said
Grosvenor in the House, "and they see in it danger to their su
premacy." Surely the time is at hand when this country, acknowl
edging the supremacy of none save in this respect, must retrieve the
resources lost to it on the seas since the days of iB6O, when 91 per
cent of our sea-borne commerce was carried in the holds of Ameri
can ships.
THE NORMAL SCHOOL BILL.
THE Senate has passed the appropriation of $150,000 for the San
Francisco Normal School, and it is on the calendar for action
in the Assembly. It is to be hoped that it will soon pass the
, lower branch and go to the Governor. The Governor of California
lis a very busy official. His chief duty, which Governor Pardee never
neglects even under pressure, is to guard the State's finances and
the money of the people by seeing that it is appropriated only to
â  worthy objects of public concern. It will fall to the friends of this
! school not only to see the bill through the House, but to supply
the Governcr with the convincing facts which will make it his duty
and his pleasure to sign the bill and make it the law.
In the discussion of the measure in the Senate there were
; some signs of opposition from the vicinity of the other normal
schools. This should not be. These schools should be so distri
buted over the State as to facilitate economical access to them.
Young millionaires are not training to be teachers in the public
schools. The normal schools are sought by the youth of both
I sexes who must seek the means of self-support. They feel a lead
; ing toward the teacher's profession as a vocation. The public
j schools require trained teachers, though the rewards of the calling
I are not sumptuous.
It is the duty of the State to its public schools to supply them
with teachers and this duty is best discharged by locating normal
schools where they are accessible without incurring great expense
for the enjoyment of their advantages. It is unfair to the bay
region to give it no normal facilities nearer than San Jose or Chico.
The school is established here by law. It has been housed by the
charity of the local school board in quarters now condemned by the
Board of Health and to be renovated to shelter a Chinese school.
The appropriation for a building for it is belated, but most necessary
and proper.

let me return this. "
"You have surely emrned it." she

A GLARING ERROR
THAT NOBODY
CAUGHT.
Her* la a remarkable Instance of how
a blunderâ one of the most obvious and
glaring blunders possible â may escape
the notice of a whole army of proof
readers and editors:
A. B. wrote a certain paper for a pop
ular Journal. This paper went through
certain successive stages during the
process of production. At each stag*
it received a new reading from begin
ning to end. Thus:
1. It was written in MS. Then it was
read through and in great part rewrit
ten.
2. It was read through again when
completed, and sent to be typewritten.
3. The typewriter read it through be
fore sending it back.
4. The author corrected the typewrit
ten MS. carefully and sent it in again.
6. It was then set up in type.
6. The author received a proof, which !
he read and corrected, sending it back
for press.
7. The editor or the sub-editor read
it finally and passed It for the maga
zine.
The paper thus had at least seven '
readings. Yet a blunder was passed,
if the author made it â or committed,
if he did not make It â of a most ele
mentary description; one that leaps to
the eyes; one that stands out of the
page calling on everybody to spot it,
correct it, put an end to it.
The blunder was simply this. A cer- |
tain strike of worklngmen was spoken
of as undertaken for "lower" waees â
instead of "higher." How the word
"lower" got thereâ whether the author
wrote it in the first instance, or the
typewriter, or the compositor â it is im
possible to say. Probably it was an au
thor's mistake. A long succession of
readings of the passage followed. Not
one of the readers discovered the mis
take.âTit-Bits.

HOW TO CHOOSE
A WIFE
DOROTHY FENIMORE
THE man who would _-wootnÂ«r
go had better think over what
Lorado Taft, Chicago's cele
brated sculptor, has just Inti
mated, that the expression of a
woman's lips, even when she keeps
them discreetly closed, tells to observ
ers the story of her character and dis
position. "Beautiful eyes," says he,
"a woman may have by way of inher
itance, but the mouth she makes her
self."
In declaring that the mouth is the
most delicate register of human emo
tion and of character Mr. Taft agrees
with Paolo Mantegazza, the Florentine
professor, who is the greatest living
authority on love. "The soul," declares
the latter, "dwells in the expression of
the mouth. Here converge, as their
natural center, the yearnings of love
and of desire. As the eye expresses
thought, so the mouth reveals feeling."
Compare, suggests this expert, the
emotion which la awakened in you by
a pair of beautiful eyes with that which
a beautiful mouth inspires. The first
may strike you dumb with admiration,
but at sight of the second you fall
dead in love. The eye is the azure heav
ens, the mouth is the earth with its
perfumes.
, The mouth interprets both mind and
heart, he says. In its silence even it is
eloquent. Its upper lip carries a mes
sage. Its lower lip has a story to tell.
Its delicate curves in repose speak as
effectively as do its roiinded curves in
laughter.
And now for specific instructions:
The best way to study a woman's
mouth, it seems, is to get!a view of it
In profile in a dim light, yhere a slight
shadow will be thrown upon the upper
lip. The mouth whose upper lip pro
jects over the lower one shows a good
heart and a tendency toward sentiment.
The loyal girl has lips which advance
equally. When the lower lip projects
beyond the upper one its owner has an
irritable disposition.
There you are; now go ahead, you
who had your salary raised at New
Tear's, and think that you can afford
the luxury of a wife. Whatever , other
attractions a maiden fair may haye â
soulful eyes, soft hair, bewitching girl
ishness â disregard all these Inviting
charms, and as you walk beside her in
the moonlight on some warmer night
than this concentrate your attention
upon the expression of her mouth.

THE FIGURE SEVEN.
The figure 7 has always played an
important part in history. It may be
interesting for boys and girls to read
a few of the traditions in which it fig
ures. It is said in ancient history that
on the 7th day of the 7th month there
was a holy observance ordered to the
children of Israel. They feasted 7
days and stayed 7 days in their tents.
The 7th year was a year of rest. At
the end of 7 times 7 years began a
year of jubilee. Every 7th year the
land lay fallow. Every 7 years there
was a grand release from debt and
bondsmen were set free.
Perhaps from these old laws, says
the Brooklyn Eagle, came the later
customs in which the magical 7
plays so important a part. A young

A diaciple of the "simple life" and
a true citizen, Mr. Downey has not
only managed to accumulate a com

This man, whom the President could

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. FEBRUARY 5, 1905.
"As an example of what can be
done and should be done by the in
dividual citizen, I shall mention
something that recently occurred in
this city of Washington, a thing that
doubtless many of you know about,
but which was unknown to me until
recently. A few weeks ago, when I
was walking back from church one
Sunday, I noticed a great fire, and
found that it was Downey's livery
stable.
"I had long known of the very ad
mirable work done, with a singular
modesty and self-effacement, by Mr.
Downey in trying to give homes to
the homeless, to be himself a friend
of those in a peculiar sense friendless
; in this community, and I by accident
i found out what had happened in con
nection with this particular incident.
It appears that last spring Mr. Dow
ney started to build a a new livery
stable; the stable is next door to a
colored Baptist church. Mr. Downey
is a white man and a Catholic, and
these neighbors of his are colored
men and Baptists, but there is be
tween them a kinship of that broad
humanity that should underlie all our
t feelings toward one another.
"Mr. Downey started to build his
; stable, and naturally wanted to have
;it as big a stable as possible and
build it right up to the limits of his
land. That brought the wall close
til strong enough to support them
selves; and finally, when removed
to the great open and transplanted, all
still received care and attention. The
result of this training is very appar
ent in the beautiful symmetery we
can every day see in the park, and
feel all the better for the artistic
beauty presented.
The reflective mind, however, looks
back upon the incipiency of this sym
metrical beauty, and it must be logi
cally admitted it was in the nursery,
the training there and the care be
stowed for a few years after trans
planting. The incongruous conditions
of our sociological present might
have been of different shape if the
propping, the pruning, the care, al
ways with an eye to the future, had
been applied in the days of childhood,
obviating the general overhauling now.
The declaration is frequently heard
that "there are no more children
now"; that the young know as much
in their teens of things which con
taminate modesty and innocence as
their forebears did in their twenties.
The cynic deliberately states that the
much boasted and poetical simplicity
of childhood is but a platitude of
pulpit sentimentality. The cynic, how
ever, is not always right. But whether
it be-so or is not, it is only too evident
that the full-grown sociological tree
presents a decidedly wayward ap
pearance of pernicious confusion, in
asmuch as, not only a city's com
munity takes cognizance of existing
conditions, but apparently the whole
of the nations of the civilized world.
sors, is certainly of interest. For, if
granted, it also involves the state
ment that, because the nerves of
women are so highly strained, they
fly to drugs and alcohol as a remedy
for the lassitude and ennui which is
the result of the state of high press
ure in which their lives are passed.
The life of to-day for both men
and women is more strenuous and
exhausting than that of our fathers
and mothers. The strain is more con
tinuous and the periods of relaxation
are fewer. Nor does it become less
arduous; for every successive year
seems to add to the duties, occupa
tions and amusements which crowd it.
To those who work, life becomes
more busy year by year. Even to
the butterflies, amusements are so
numerous and so varied that they are
more often a fatigue than a pleasure.
Both try to cram into life an amount
of wear and tear and enjoyment suffi
cient to try the strongest constitu
tions, and because some succumb to
the strain we are treated to a chorus
up against the back of the colored
Baptist church, cutting out the light
and air. The preacher called upon
him and told him that he would like
to purchase a strip, six feet broad,
of Mr. Downey'! ground, upon which
he was intending to build, as it
would be a great Inconvenience to
them to lose the light and air; that
they were aware it was asking a great
deal of him to cramp the building
out of which he intended to make his
livelihood, but that they hoped he
would do it because of their need. Af
ter a great deal of thought Mr. Dow
ney came to the conclusion that he
ought to grant their request, and so
he notified them that he would
change his plans, make a somewhat
smaller building and sell them the
six feet of land in the strip adjoin
ing the church.
"After a little while the preacher
came around with the trustees of his
church and said they very much ap
preciated Mr. Downey's* courtesy, and
were sorry they had bothered him as
they had, because in looking into the
affairs of the church they found, as
they were already in debt, they did
not feel warranted in incurring any
further financial obligations, and so
they had to withdraw their request.
They thanked him for his kindly pur
pose and said good-by.
And these nations are supposedly [
Christian nations. There has been j
failure somewhere. Murder, suicide, J
infanticide, divorce, elopement, in- i
fidelity, new-born babes abandoned;
a general laxity of morals on the in- j
crease all along the line and out of
all proportion to the growth of popu
lation.
WÂ« are told of the decline of chiv
alrous courtesy of men toward the
weaker sex in these days, so evident
in the generation fast passing away.
We read about the dignified and
stately manners of gentlefolk of by
gone years in books that are fast get
ting moldy. The new book mea
sures gentility by purse and dress.
Poverty has become more of a crime
in the twentieth century than before,
and so great is the fear and detesta
tion of it that poverty must be cov
ered up and hidden under external at
tire â the very dread of gossip sub
merging the scruples of how ob
tained.
The legitimate press has unswerv
ingly shown up the evils which are
now so well known. The press has
many a time been censured for its
audacity in daring to spread out to the
entire public the true condition of
things, when, truth to tell, were it not
for this daring the community would
still be ignorant of the evils which,
like cankerworms, are eating into
the very vitals of our national life.
The pulpit is still a power to those
who have united with the churches;
but it must be rationally admitted that
the press yields tremendous power !
of lamentations on the deterioration
of women's health and morale.
To the casual observer it seems that
the women of to-day are stronger,
better made and more equal to the
calls which are made on their health
than they ever were. There is hardly
a woman who does not interest her
self in some work, if it be only the
calls of enjoyment, and those who be
long to the ranks of the latter class
are but a miserable portion of the
thousands who not only earn their
living, but take an active part in all
kinds of charitably, philanthropic or
social work. The fact that women
are so full of physical and mental ac
tivity, and have proved themselves so
capable in all they have undertaken,
seems an unanswerable reply to the
accusation that they are deteriorating
in health or getting under the in
fluence of narcotics.
There is, in some ways, less strain
on women's health to-day than for
merly, for they marry later and have
fewer children. The size and height
"But Mr. Downey found he could
not get to sleep that night, until
finally he made up his mind that as
they could not buy it he would give
it to them anyway, which he did.
But, unfortunately, we know that
the tower of Siloam often falls npon
the just and the unjust alike, and
Mr. Downey's livery stable caught
fire and burned down. It was Sunday
morning and the Baptist church was
in session next door to him, and the
clergyman stopped and said:
" 'Now, you women stay here and
pray, and you men go straight out
and help our benefactor, Mr. Dow
ney.'
"And go oat they did and got his
horses oat so that none of them were
burned, although he suffered other
wise a total loss.
"Now, I call that a practical appli
cation of Mr. Wagner's teachings.
Here in Washington we have a right
to be proud of a citizen like Mr. Dow
ney, and if only we can develop
enough such citizens we shall turn
out just the kind of community that
does not need to but always will be
glad to study 'The Simple Life.' "
Mr. Downey was not in the great
audience of social, official and diplo
matic Washington when the Presi
dent was sounding his praises. In
stead, he was superintending the
in thus being able, and sufficiently
daring, to curb through the very fear
of "showing up" the licentiousness of
that portion of the community which, ;
fearing neither God nor devil, would
terrorize morality either by brute
force or seductive craft. It is by this
daring of our press that other nati6ns"
have made inquiry into their own
conditions, with the inevitable re
sults that the quiet externals have
deceived them for years and they
have awakened to the bitter fact that
these same conditions exist among
themselves.
Is a "morganatic marriage" a pret
ty word for bigamy in the high life,
and are the frequent scandals in aris
tocratic courts on a par with frequent
divorces here? Practically evil con
ditions are but cases of "follow my
leader." The masses ape the classes.
But it might reasonably be asked,
"What was the incipient cause of the
unsymmetrical tree?" and find answer,
"Lack of careful training." The same
question might be asked of these so
cial evils.
We gather from what we hear and
read that time was when the child
was taught to '"honor thy father and
thy mother" â to respect old age â to
revere things sacred â to do unto
others as he would have others do
unto him â to pity and assist the help
less â and, above all, that morality
and courtesy were the essential char
acteristics of a gentleman. It was
the simple religion taught at mother's
knees â mother knew, and mother
taught the child what she knew, and
one nod of paternal affirmation cor
of women have increased, and they
are, in relation to men, finer animals;
they stand in their competition with
men in no mean position. That there
are some women who drink more
than is good for them, in order to
counteract that feeling of depression
and exhaustion, produced by many
causes besides those of overexertion
and excitement, no one can deny.
But there are not in the least typical;
nor does their existence in any way
prove that there is such a habit grow
ing up among women as a class. Some
of their critics affirm that the drug
habit is confined to the women of the
"smart set," whoever they may be.
It is so easy to generalize wildly, not
weighing the responsibility of such
statements.
"The smart set," we will assume,
spends a large portion of its time in
amusement, and no doubt suffers
from the fatigue incidental to that;
but there are hundreds of women be
longing to it who work hard in many
I ways, and who use both time and
"Good Samaritan Home," a home for
the homeless and friendless, which he
has established and conducted since
1895. Mr. Downey pays all the bills
of the home.
During that time he has cared for,
fed and clothed and secured employ
ment for more than 5000 persons. .
"We are living in the most ad
vanced country in civilization and
Christianity in the whole world." Mr.
Downey said to the New York World
correspondent, "yet we find in every
municipality throughout this broad
land rigid laws against the destitute
and unemployed workingman who has
not friends or money to secure food
or shelter. When he is found strand
ed it may be his fault or his misfor
tune, after seeking 1 employment, may
be, In hundreds of places. He Is a
stranger. His appearance is haggard
and his clothes may be untidy. No
body wants him. He is thus forced
to the choice of four things or alter
natives â to beg, to starve, to steal
or to commit suicide.
"The Judge may ask him If he has
anything to say, but the poor man
admits he was begging, as he could
not find employment and had no
money to procure food or shelter. He
receives a sentence of thirty, sixty or
ninety days or maybe six months In

roborated mother's teaching. It was
the gospel truth grasped in childhood.
It was the young and tender plant
propped up in weak parts, the useless
leaves nipped off, and the unsymmet
rical branches, which, if allowed to
grow, would spoil the future career,
were brought under the pruning
knife of castigation and admonition.
This was the nursery of the building
up of character on a religious founda
| tion.
The denominational contention and
wrangling brought about practically
the exclusion of all religious teach
ing and moral precepts in the sched
ules of the School Board system of
England under the education act of
1870. (Gladstone's inception.) The
daily religious instruction of morals,
as part of the school training, being
withdrawn, the children grew up to
respect and admire t!ie Greek, Ro
man and Saxon heroes and their tales
of "derring do"; they were familiar
with these, but the morals and pre
cepts of Christianity they were not.
They were familiar with the discov
eries of foreign lands and conversant
with the conditions of the heathen,
but knew nothing of fhe poor, self
sacrificing missionary who made it
possible to live there. Those chil
dren are men and women to-day and
they are fathers and mothers, but the
cry all along the line is the decline of
morality, courtesy, chivalrous for
bearance, respect and reverence.
Consequently the old legislators are
to-day seeing the result of their with
drawing religious inculcations, and
trouble in helping those in want and
sorrow, and no one is conscious that
they ever do more than think of
amusement and chiffon. It is so easy
jon insufficient evidence to attack a
: class and pin it down to a particu
lar weakness, because it is always
; more amusing to criticize than to
praise, and the "smart set" is a handy
scapegoat to attack.
Those who do so know nothing
about them, nor do they know who
belongs to the set. It is a purely fic
titious designation bestowed by the
slipshod journalism of to-day, which
is becoming the real reproach to our
country. Vice and weakness is not
| the monopoly of any class here cr
anywhere else. The working classes
j are not perfect, and those who teach
and lead them have as much of the
weaknesses of human nature as any
one. The truth is that it is easy to
.attack a class by making accusations
I too ridiculous to answer, even were
that class not too proud to pay any
attention to them.
in the chain gang. At the exptratioa
of his term he is discharged without
a nickel to buy his next meal, thus
making him ten times more wretched
and degraded than before his arrest.
The brand of a felon is added to his
poverty. I regard this treatment a*
nothing short of barbarous. I try to
help these men. 1 *
Mr. Downey had practically for
gotten the incident of the gift of
ground to the negro church until the
day of the fire which destroyed hi*
stable.
"That day brought me my reward,"
he said in discussing the matter. "The
minister was in the pulpit preaching
when the conflagration was an
nounced. He immediately called upon
the congregation to be calm and pa
tient. He recommended that thÂ«
women pray, while the men were
urged to go at one* and help me.
They rushed Into my place, where
there were 160 fine horses in their
â tails in danger of being cremated,
and all were saved, not one animal
betng injured in the slightest. That
was my reward.
The land given by Mr. Downey to
the church consisted of 300 square
feet, worth about $1000. In addition
to this he was compelled to change
his building plans, which cost him
$400 more, so that in all his contribu
tion to the church was $1400.
churchmen are exerting feverishly all
their strength to bring about the old
and tried methods to undo the harm
which has been done. "Educate the
masses" was once the constant cry â
and that education without religion
has evolved scientific burglars, clev
erer forgers, smarter thieves and
more acute designing men, as well as
giving the masses a vast amount ->f
mundane wisdom. But the morality
of the community has not gone hand
in hand with the pace of wisdom.
Prevention is better than enre.
The whole tone of the nation's so
ciological life in the future can only
be raised to purest pitch by inculca
tion of religious restraint, religious
scruples and religious respon
sibility in the children now, if
the future citizens are to be self
respecting, sober and moral. There
are yet thousands upon thousands of
homes in this great land that are ideal
homes. There are still parents who
aim at bringing tip their children to
lofty ideals and noble characters
rather than shine in the foibles, fol
lies and wantonness so often pre
sented. There are still hosts of chil
dren who love, honor and obey father
and mother and are buoyed up with
Christian precepts; hosts of children
who still exemplify the poet's ideal
of modesty and innocence. And ;f
these homes are more or less exclu
sive it is because the parents have
learned that "evil communications
corrupt good manners." Invariably
these homes are those which religion
dominates its influence.

Bay Pirates' Lair.
The police yesterday discovered on ;
an abandoned whaler moored off the
loot of Second street what they, believe
to be the home of all the bay pirates, |
and some of the booty gathered by the '
uutiaws from wharves and ships. .A I
man supposed lo be a pirate was found !
en board and taken into custody. He '
gave the name of George Smith, but
the police say his real name is Hopps'
and that he has been in trouble before.
The fact that the old whaling bark
was a thieves' shelter and storehouse
for stolen property was known, it is
said, to nearly everybody residing: with
in sisht of the derelict. Although dep
redations have been of almost daily oc
currence and although every theft has
been reported to the police, no real ef
fort was made to locate the pirates'
lair. Somebody told the police yester
day about the old whaler, and Police
man McGowan visited the half-sunk
remains of the ancient blubber hunter.
He stepped below and there found
Smith, alias Hopps, whom he arrested.
The vessel was searched. Sleeping and
lounging Quarters where a dozen men
apparently have been in the habft of
making themselves comfortable were
discovered on the 'tween decks. Canvas ,
stolen from bay craft supplied the place
of carpet, and each bank was plenti- j
fully equipped with eiderdown quilts !
and blankets, articles of comfort com- .
mandeered at different times from the
cabins of vessels of high and low de- j
gree. There were pelts and hides iden
tified as part cf a lot of stuff stolen re
cently from the Oregon dock, and there |
were bullseye lanterns, ship lanterns
and a miscellaneous collection of hard
ware. There was â  plentiful supply of
previsions and a stove on which to cook
them. â¢
The pirates were absent, and when
they return they will find their estab- j
lishment sadly disturbed, for McGowan
lhrew overboard most of their house
keeping Bear and took away all the
loot. People living in the vicinity told
the police yesterday that the pirates j
had ur,ed the old whaler for a long' time
ar.<l that a steady procession of skiffs,
visited the derelict " every night. A \
watchman on a nearby boat informed j
the officers of the law that the pirates
disposed of most of their stuff some
where ui> the Sacramento River, where
they made regular trips. Everybody
but the police seemed to be well ac
quainted with the pirates' roost. Mc-
Gowan was reealed yesterday with a
long series of exciting tales of the In
dustry of the freebooters, who are cred- ,
ited with having concealed somewhere
a famous collection of firearms, # dag
gers, knives and burglars' tools.

trious the :>olice know. Some of the
stolen property was recovered yester
day, but most of it Is yet unaccounted â

the vicinity and desire to renew old
friendships.
Men from the pioneer class of '95
to the coming class of '05 were in evi
dence and the occasion passed with
keen enjoyment for men who have
been "up against" the dollar since
leaving college. The luncheon is an
established function for the first Sat
urday in every month and all Stan-ford
men are invited to attend. The ulti
mate object of the meetings is to bring
a sufficient number of men who can be
depended on together for the purpose
of establishing a permanent headquar
ters and clubroom.
Among those present were: Ernest
Brune '01, Loujs Ferrari '01, George
Hewlett '03, Francis St. J. Fox '00, F.

Contempt Proceedings Continued.
All day yesterday was occupied in
arguments of counsel on the applica
tion of R. A. Crothers and Fremont
Older of the Bulletin for a transfer
of the contempt proceedings from
Judge Cook's court to some other
court. Affidavits were submitted al
leging bias and prejudice on the part
of Judge Cook. The Judge wanted to
fll** a counter affidavit, but Attorney
Garret McEnerney objected and after
argument the Judge took the matter
under advisement. Another point was
raised that as the habeas corpus pro
ceedings on which the contempt was
based were before the Judge as a ju
dicial 6fficer and not before the court
there was no contempt of court. Judg
ment on this point was also reserved
till Tuesday.

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
Prime offerings of Burbanks continued to
meet with a steady demand and receivers ex
perienced no difficulty in disposing of such
stock at full figures, but low-grade lots of
all table descriptions were slow of sal* at un
sustalned prices. There was practically no
market for common river Burbanks, which
were piled high on the wharves awaiting buy
ers. There were no fresh arrivals of Sweets
and oholc* lots moved freely at the old quo
tations, while poor quality offerings could not
be sold at any price. Onions were suddenly
firmer, available supplies being very light. Ad
vices from Oregon cay that the visible supply
in that State haa been greatly reduoed of lav
and the growers are holding out for high pilots
at shipping points.
Trade in miscellanaous regwtablea was ac
tive, as usual on Saturday and ohoto* â¢ffer

carried-over_lots of Peaa. Tomatoes and Green

Poultry and Game.
The Poultry market was rather steady, v con
sidering the heavy, receipts and the weak feel
ing of the two preceding days, and there was
very little .domestic live stock left on hand at
the clo6e. Some large handlers were t obliged
to cut prices of old chickens , during the latter
part " of the week, . but young stock \ remained
steady throughout owing to the extra demand
Tor tho Chinese New Year celebration. Two
cars. of Western stock cams to hand yesterday,
making a total of eight cars received for the
week. Only one car was hauled to the stores,
the others -being hold 'for; Monday's , market.
California dressed Turkeys were easier owing
to the competition of Eastern - chilled ? stock,
â¢which was offering freely at quotations. There
were no changes in Game, the demand and

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Dealers' opinions as to, the value of Butter
varied considerably yesterday. . Some houses
with more stock- than they liked to have at the
close of tho week \ were offering ' at concessions
to get rid of the goods, while others with light
supplies, were steady. Quotations In the main
were unchanged,, but .the general tone of the
market was- - one of easiness. - ;*; * .
Eggs were as before stated. Buyers win
turn away, from a first-class ranch at 26c and
buy store Eggs at 256. - Hence ranch Eggs are
easy and store eggs very firm and cleaned up.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
There was come little extra buying of fresh
fruits for Sunday, but It was not of sufficient
volume to affect the market, and buyers had
everything their own way. Twenty-one car
loads of Apples came in from the north during
the past week and there Is enough of that
fruit at hand to supply the market for a
whole month, to say nothing of the stock in
cold storage. One or two varieties of extra
fancy stock In 4-th>r boxes readily command
the top quotation, but for the general run of
supplies $1 25 is an extreme figure, and large
buyers are able to fill their wants for less.
Receipts of Oranges have bÂ«>n llpht for somo

that were to have keen sold on Friday, will be

Honokaa Sugar was the active Mock on the

ruling steady to firm. Alaska Packers was
somewhat higher at $86 50 and Contra Costa
Water at $37037 26. California Wine was ex
dlvldend of 60c. The market was of a Satur
day character, but business was very good.
In the mining shares the Comstocks were
firm, with Ophir still higher at $7 S7^ bid and
Consolidated California and Virginia at $2 25,
though sales were not very heavy. The Tono
pahs had a very rood Saturday's business, with
no violent fluctuations.
Sales on the California Exchange last week
-were 27,575 shares, valued at $15,738. the lead-
Ing sales being aa follows: Associated. 5450
shares, Forty. 6600; Independence, 1300; June
tlon. 1000; OU City. 11.300; Wabasb. 1000;
Pittsburg, 1316.
Central Eureka Mining Company has de- :
clared a regular monthly div Wend of 7c per I
â¢hare, amounting to $28,000, payable Febru
ary 9.
The output of the Ophir mine last week
amounted to 113 mining carloads of ore assay
ing $155 61 pey Â«!n. and 107 carloads assaying
$14 S9 per ton.

INDIAN AFFAIRS
President Declares No Law r
*W T as Violated When Funds
Were Given to Institutions
MONEY OF THE REDMEN
Executive Says Braves Have
a Eight to Direct Disposi
tion of Cash That Is Theirs
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â President
Roosevelt has sent a letter to Secre
tary Hitchcock on the subject of au
thority to grant contracts for the edu
cation of Indians in denominational
schools.
The President says that inasmuch as
the authority exists to grant the re
quest of the Indians, unquestionably
they are entitled by moral right to have
their moneys used to educate their chil
dren at the schools they choose. The
President directs that the Interior De
partment continue the practice unless
Congress directs otherwise or the
courts hold that the decision of the
Department of Justice to this effect is
wrong. The President also urges the
passage of the Lacey bill authorizing
the allotment of annuities in severalty
to the Indians in the same way as their
land is allotted. The President's letter
follows:
"WHITE HOUSE. WASHINGTON.
D. C. Feb. 3, 190EV.â To the Secretary of
tho Interior: I have received from you
the letter from the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs of January ?1. 1905, in
'â elation to the inquiries of the Hon.
James S. Sherman as to the authority
for granting contracts for education of
Indians in denominational schools. This
letter of tffe Commissioner of Indian
Affairs asks that the general questions
raised in Mr. Sherman's letter of Jan
uary 2?, he united with the special ques
tion raised by the Commissioner in his
letter of January 21 and presented to
the President for submission to the
Attorney General.
"The letter of January 21 concerning
the payment of a claim filed in the of
fice of Indian Atfairs in connection with
the contract with the St. Labres School
on the Tongue River reservation stands
by itself and will be submitted to the
Attorney General for his consideration
and report.
RECEIVES PETTTTOXS.
"As regards the general question I
have received from the Attorney Gen
era] under date .of February 2 a letter,
a copj* of which is enclosed. Early in
1902 petitions on behalf of the various
Catholic and Episcopal schools were
brought to my attention by certain ec
clesiastics and laymen who requested
the Interior Department to distribute
the rations and annuities through the
mission schools of their several
churches, when the children were in
the care of those schools. The Attor
ney General decided that this request
was illegal and could not properly be
granted. Over a year afterward the
request was made originally on behalf
of certain Catholic schools in 1903, also
nn behalf of a Lutheran School in
1904, that where there were Indian
moneys held in trust for the Indians by
the Secretary of the Interior, the inter
est on these Indian moneys being dis
tributed among the individual Indians
or such other ways as the Secretary of
the Interior might direct, and where
certain Indians petitioned that the
moneys so distributed to them should
be used for the support of the particu
lar denominational school which they
desiied their children to attend, this
petition should be granted.
The question raised was, of course,
wholly different from that originally
raised on behalf of the Episcopal
church and of the Catholic church.
This new request was submitted to the
Department of Justice and the depart
ment decided, as set forth in the ac
companying report, that the prohibi
tion of the law as to the use of public
moneys for sectarian schools did r.ot
extend to moneys belonging to the In
dians themselves and not to the public,
and that these moneys belonging to
the Indians themselves might be ap
plied in accordance with the desire of
the Indians for the support of *ne
schools to which they were sending
their children.
INDIANS HAVE RIGHTS.
"There was, in my judgment, no
question that, inasmuch as the legal
authority existed to grant the request
of the Indians, they were entitled as a
matter of moral right to have the mon
eys coming to them used for the educa
tion of their children at the schools of
their choice. Care must be taken, of
course, to see that any petition by the
Indians is genuine and that the money
appropriated for a given school repre
sents only the pro rata proportion to
which the Indians jnaking the petition
are entitled. But if these two conditions
are fulfilled it is in my opinion just and
right that the Indians themselves
should have their wishes respected
when they request that their own
moneyâ not the money of the publicâ
be applied to the support of certain
schools to which they desire to send
their children. The practice will be
continued by the department unless
Congress should decree to the contrary,
or. of course, unless the courts should
decide that the decision of the Depart
ment of Justice is erroneous.
"It Is, however, greatly to be desired
that the bill Introduced by Representa
tive Lacey and providing for permission
to allot these annuities in severalty to
the Indians, exactly as is done now
with land, should be enacted into law.
Its enactment and administration would
prevent the raising of any question of
this character, for each individual In
dian would then be left free to use the
money to which he is entitled outright
on his own initiative, instead of having
it used for him by the Secretary of the
Interior, in consequence of his petition.
I earnestly hope that Congress will at
once enact this bill into a law.
"The special case of the St. Labres
school stands by itself, the question
being whether the contract entered into
is one authorized by the finding of the
Department of Justice in January, 1905,
or whether it is one of those cases for
bidden under the decision of the De
partment of Justice of January, 1902.
The Attorney General will speedily re
port the category In which this case

Her clever son. Winston Churchill,

tariff scheme. Mrs. Cornwallis West
has adopted her son's views, and. as
it is not her nature to be a mere pas

her a welcome guest.
The head of the Churchill family,

Mrs. Cornwallis West and the Vander

LONDON, Feb. I.â Whatever finan
cial arrangements may have preceded
Miss Daisy Letter's marriage to the
Karl of Suffolk, she certainly has not
parted with th* most cherished of an
American woman's privileges â of
being: unconventional for a title. She
Isn't going to assume aristocratic air;
when she doesn't want to to please

her sifter, Mrs. Colin Campbell, she
â¢went shopping afoot here, which is con

a well-known department store near
Hyde Park several customers recog
nized them and communicated- their
discovery to others, and, as a result,
the American brides made the acquain
tance of several varieties of the Brit
ish feminine stars, frequently accom
panied by the audible comment, ''There
goes Daisy Letter and her sister." At
one of the counters an aristocratic
looking woman remarked to a sales
man, with what was meant for with
ering sarcasm and in a voice which all
around could hear: "I suppose the poor
things could not afford a respectable
honeymoon." However. , the two brides
did not seem at bit flustered by the at

on enjoying themselves in *heir own

REFORMS DOMESTICS.
ThÂ» Duchess of Marlborough. who
Inherits much of the Vanderbilt spirit,
The San Francisco Call.
which prompts her to run things to
*uit herself, has set at defiance British
precedent, and has undertaken to in
troduce sundry reforms in the domestic
management of her Mayrair establish
ment. The new system is not working
altogether smoothly and in consequence
there have been several ructions below
stairs. As many as "fifteen servants of
various grades have been dismissed
within three months, each receiving a
month's wages In lieu of the usual no
tice. It is the custom in large English
houses to leave the management of the
household staff in the hands of the
chief butler. It saves trouble, but it
does not make for economy and effi
ciency. The Duchess has divided her
menials into sections, each having a
head who is responsible to her person
ally. The servants finding that they
could not take things as easy as before,
resented the change and several shake
ups foilowed and the end of them is
not yet.
I'nder the new regime accounts for
household expenses are now checked by
the Duchess herself, instead of being
"O. K'd," as is customary in similar
establishments by the butler or chef.
As these functionaries generally receive
liberal commissions from tradesmen
their interest naturally lies in making
the bills as large as the pockets of their
employers will stand. It is this sort of
thing that the Duchess intends to put
a stop to. A few days ago what she
considered an excessive consumption of
coal attracted her attention and she
went into a mathematical calculation,
based on the number of fires kept
going, to ascertain how long the twen
ty tons in the cellars would lust.
Friends of the Duchess are watching
her experiment with sympathetic inter
est, but sadly confessing that they lack
the courage to undertake such reforms
in their own homes. The Duke takes
no hand in the matter. Affairs at the
Colonial Office are supposed to make
such heavy demands on his mental
powers that he has no energy left to
wrestle with domestic problems.

American millionaire, still retains a

trymen. For that reason he has

dence, while Rushton Hall is being
fixed uo, a fiat in the midst of the
American colony. It is in Down
street and is of the bijou variety, con
taining only six rooms. Many much'
more commodious fiats were offered
to him in the Chelsea and Kensing
ton districts, where dwellings of that
variety are much affected, but he said
that he preferred a small flat where
Americans abound to a big one in a
neighborhood where Americans are
scarce. And meanwhile, as he does
not intend to do any entertaining until
his country place is ready for his oc
cupancy, he can get along on six
rooms.
He had previously been making his
headquarters in London at a hotel,
but found that the ways of English
hotels are not to his liking. His de- I
parture was much regretted by the
staff of the establishment, for he was
most generous In his "tips." There
has been much kicking of late against
that form of extortion, but English
folk declare that it is no use attempt
ing to stop it while rich ' Americans so
recklessly encourage it. However,
this kind of stimulus to menial zeal
proved po efficacious with the waiter
who attended to his wants in the i
dining-room of the hotel that Van i
Alen has permanently engaged him, <

REJANE DANCES
ON TABLE'S TOP
French Actress Adds Piq
uancy to the Hyde Ball
i at Sherry's, New York
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 4.â Mme. Rejane
danced a cancan on the top of a table
at the Hyde ball at Sherry's ony Tues
day night.
Ever since the night of James Hazen
Hyde's ball at Sherry's, with Mme. Ga
brielle Rejane, the French actress, as
the guest of honor, there has been a
story to this effect about town. Ac
counts differ as to how the episode
came about. One version has It that
Mme. Rejane interpolated this specialty
as a sort of entre acte between her
friend Nicodemis' little play, "Entre
Deux Portes," and a recitation written
for the occasion, which proved so long
that it sent some members of King
Louis' gay court half asleep. Another
version has it that the cancan episode
did not take place until an early hour
in the morning, after everybody had
had at least one supper and a good ,
many of the more staid guests had gone
home.
All accounts agree upon one point,
and that Is that Mme. Rejane did climb
on top of the -table and execute a dance
which couldn't have been beaten by
any professional dancer at the Moulin
Rouge. In fact, she danced with so
much abandon and grace that she suc
cessfully effaced all recollection, of Lit
tle Egypt, who until then held the
record for this sort of specialty at
Sherry's.
To say that this dance of Mme. Re
jane's created a sensation is putting it
quite mildly. The cancan has been ta
_b_aoed at Sherry's for many seasonsâ
ever since the famous Seeley dinner, in
factâ and as far as one can judge from
the passing remarks of those who wit
nessed Mme. Rejane's terpslchorean spe
cialty It is likely to be put away in lav
ender again at Sherry's for some time.
Of all the guests of Mr. Hyde who
were" Interviewed to-day only one, a
close personal friend of the host, was
found who would deny that the episode
occurred. _._.-' â¢'

SENATOR FRANK FRENCH IS THRASHED
BY DETECTIVE G. N . TICHENOR.
Short but Decisive
Battle Is Fought
and Quickly Won
AFFAIR OCCURS
ON THE STREET
Statesman Pugilist
Is Outclassed by
Man He Insulted
The warlike propensities of Frank !
French, one of the State Senators !
accused of accepting 1 bribes, were
punched out of him yesterday in front j
of the Merchants' Exchange building j
by the hard flst of Detective George :
N. Tichenor of the Continental Build- j
ing and Loan Association. The little !
detective more than avenged the as
sault made upon him Thursday night '
by the burly Senator at Sacramento.
Three blows were struck, all by \
Tichenor, and each landed upon the |
countenance of the pugnacious states- i
man. French lapsed into that state
technically termed "groggy" and of
fered only weak protests when by
standers separated him from the
doughty detective.
It happened almost before a crowd j
could assemble. Tichenor had left j
the office of the Continental Building
and Loan Association and was walk
ing up California street. Suddenly he
was approached by the Senator, who
had proclaimed far and wide that he
would slap Tichenor's face every
time he met him. The belligerent so- J
lon'a demeanor was pacific, but Tiche
nor was taking no chances. French
had caught him once unawares and
the detective did not mean to be
caught napping again.
The big. Senator caught the little
detective py the shoulder. "I want
to talk to you," he said.
Hardly had the words been spoken
when Tichenor's flst landed between
French's eyes, sending him reeling
backward. Like an angry bull the big
Senator crouched and rushed his
smaller adversary. Tichenor stopped
him with another "straight right" and
the fighting statesman looked dis
tressed. But French was rash enough
to rush again within range of Tics- \
enor's right arm. According to spec
tators the so-called "bad man" from
the Legislature was all but out.
He turned to run when the crowd
stepped in and ended the fight. The
only injury sustained by Tichenor was
a cut on the hand, caused by the vio
lent contact of that member with
French's cranium. French disap
peared as quickly as possible. He will
wear the marks of his beating for
many days to cache.
Tichenor carries his honors mod
estly. It was in self-defense purely
that he struck. French had declared
that he would slap the detective's face
on sight and Tichenor determined
that he would not be slapped. The
doughty * detective claims that the
Legislature had told him practically
to defend himself. He did" it very
well, as French's ruffled countenance
will still show.
The witnesses of the short and
snappy battle were expecting at any
minute to hear the "petulant pop" of
the pistol and the zing of the bullet.
But the affair was straight Marquis of
Queensberry.
It was a far different French that
assailed Tichenor yesterday from the
pugnacious French who struck him
unawares at Sacramento. Then French
had a large backing and Tichenor was
practically alone. Yesterday they met
on equal terms and, according to a
bystander, "French took second
money, and very little of that."
Senator French's motive in accosting
him, Tlchenor thinks, was to try to in
duce him to "let up" on the bribery
charge. Tichenor declares that friends
of his have been approached by the
Senator with this object. The detective
declines to give the names of the per
sons, but says that he is certain that
the accused Senator has made over
tures of this sort.
Tichenor looks^nore like a clerk than
a fighting man. His appearance is ex
actly the opposite of the traditional
"bad man" or bully. When interviewed
last night he said:
"I am very sorry that this thing oc
curred. I am sory for French. I am
not a fighting man by any means, but
sometimes we have to fight. I never
strike a blow until such an occasion
arises.
"I was told by the ? nate committee
after that affair at Sacramento that I
should have to, protect myself against
French. He said he would slap my face
every time he saw me. Some friends of
mine saw him just before he came up
and" asked me if I needed any help. I
told them that I was not afraid of the
fellow. I suppose that he wanted to
talk to me about letting up on him,
but I didn't want to talk to him. As
soon as he came near me I punched
him. No, he did not attempt to reach
for any weapon. The only reaching he
did was to get away.
"I do not expect any further trouble
from him. He is only a bluiterer. I
think I can protect myself at all times
from him and any others like him. I
skinned my knuckles a little when I hit
his teeth, but that's the only damage I
sustained."

THE SENATOR WHO THREATEXED TO SLAP THB FACBS OF TH3I DBOTECTTVi:
EMPLOYED BY THE CONTINENTAL BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATION
AND THE MAN WHO PUNCHED THE PUGNACIOUS STATESMAN'S HEAD.
Jordan Says That He Has an
Explanation to Make at
Proper Time.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 4.â At a con
ference of attorneys to be held in San
Francisco to-morrow it will be deter
mined whether or not Senators French,
Bunkers, Emmons and Wright, now
under investigation before the bar of
thjKfSenate on charges of bribery, will
fcecalled upon by their counsel or coun
sel for the prosecution to testify.
It is entirely within the power of the
invesvi gating committee to compel
these men to testify, even against the
advice of their counsel; but its mem
bers have not determined what action
they will take in the matter. Plans for
the defense, it Is understood, will be
also overhauled at this conference of
attorneys, and it is understood that If
there is any way it can be done the
scheme developed Thursday to rely
alone upon impeaching Detectives
Tichenor and Hartling will be enlarged
upon. The Impeaching plan did not
meet with sufficient popular approval
to warrant it as a sole means of de
fense of the accused, and being aware
of the fact that more satisfactory evi
dence of innocence must be produced
the defense is now casting about
searching for the same.
It Is well known that strong efforts
have been made by the prosecution to
induce Joseph Jordan, the alleged go
between, to turn State's evidence and
tell all he knows. It is even said that
one of the first persons to approach
him on the subject was Frank H.
Gould, the attorney, who took a seat
with him on the train between here
and San Francisco, and urged him to
unbosom.
READY TO GO ON STAND.
Jordan has all along expressed a wll- j
lingness to go before the committee
and make a statement and as far as
turning State's evidence he has said at
all times that nothing was further
from his mind, adding at the same
time, of course, that he knew nothing ;
that would help the State's case. He
has declared that he has an explana
tion and is ready to make it when the
proper time comes.
When the special committee an- j
nounced Thursday, night that it would

ball, but made no effort to dodge it."
What Jordan will testify to is, of j
course, a matter productive of much
curiosity on the part of the public. It |
is possible that his testimony will be j
very commonplace and devoid of all
sensationalism. On the other hand, If

| he has a '"sufficient explanation" to
\ make, as he claims, it must be of a
1 sensational nature, for nothing of an
I ordinary sort would form a sufficient
I explanation under the existing circum
i stances.
MEMORY MAY FAIL HIM.
What is expected is that he will sim
r ply deny that he ever received any
1 meney from Tlchenor. or that hÂ« gave
any money to either of the four Sena
tors. Asked by the committee of the
prosecution about his movements on
the night the money is alleged to have
been paid, and whether he saw the ac
cused Senators on that night, he may
fall back on a bad memory. He does
not have to remember.
There are the positive facts of his
meeting Tlchenor at his room at llld
Seventh street, and giving him his key
to use, both of which are substantiated
by the young daughter of the landlady.
These he can scarcely deny, but he may
say that Tlchenor was there on a very
different errand from that to which he
testified. At least Jordan may rwear
that he never received any' money from
Tichenor, Just as the Senators will
swear that they never received any
from Jordan.
It is told of Jordan that when some
one Informed him the case against him
looked black, as two detectives bad
sworn positively that they had seen
him pass money to two Senators, he
said: "And the two Senators will
swear that I did not." This is a straw
indicative of his line of defense.
ON FRIENDLY TERMS.
It Is said that Jordan could admit
that he took the money from Tlchenor,
but swear he never gave one cent to
any of the Senators and go scot free,
as there would be no crime he could
be charged with for merely taking
money handed him by the detective,
and the people who put It up would
have small chance of recovering it
There is no one here who believes
these things. The general belief la that
the money passed, as has been testified
to. but if all the accused men testify
that they did not receive any money
it will tend tt> mystify, except as to the
one thoroughly established fact that
Jordan met Tlchenor at the former's
room on Seventh street and gave him
the key.
It is well known that Jordan and the
accused Senators have been en the molt

TOKHAXCE IMPEACHMENT.
Assembly Committee Hears Testimony .
Against Accused Jurist.
SAN DIEGO. Feb. 4.â The Assembly '
committee appointed to investigate the
charges brought against Judge E. S.
Turrance by the Los Angeles Bar As
tion, in an endeavor to secure his
impeachment, began hearing testimony
â¢"-day. The Lus Angeles Bar As- .
:ion was represented by W. H.
Anderson and Russ A very, and Samuel
M. Shortridge of San Francisco repre
sented Judge Torrance. J. C. Hizar, a
Itwjrvr of this city, was the first wit-
He slated that he thought the
Judge was under the influence of
liquor. About the middle of the year
15?O3, he said. Judge Torrance had
â Jgned an order in a probate case and
had placed his name below the line
provided for the signature. At the
time of making the order the Judge
B.iid he was of the opinion that he had
not the authority to do so and an
nounced that he would not be bound
by it. Witness thought his remarks
were peculiar. He was of the opinion
that Judge Torrance had been drink
ing.
TThen asked why he was of this
opinion Hitar said that Judge Tor
rance seemed to have difficulty in
ep^aking and the fact that he had
Bigned his name ln the wrong place
was peculiar. Witness, however, was
rot prepared to say that Judge Tor
rance was intoxicated on that day.
Later Hizar said he thought Torrance
was intoxicated.
This opinion was based upon the
general actions of Torrance. Mr. Hi
tar further declared that on one occa
sion, going dnto a saloon, he found Tor
rance boxing with a "rough looking
fellow." Hizar stated, however, that
Torrance was "not much intoxicated."
Hizar said that he never saw Torrance
Intoxicated before or since that time.
Under questioning by Attorney Short
ridge Hizar said that at the time Judge

opinion was based upon comment of

Judge George W. Puterbaugh was the

that he had observed Judge Torrance.

ATTORNEYS ARE INTERESTED.
Seek Passage of Bill Providing Fees
for Defending Indigent Prisoners.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 4.â There is a j
strong lobby of "rising young attor- j
neys" here working for the passage of !
Senator Bauer's bill that relates to the I
payment of fees to attorneys as- |
signed by courts to defend per- '
sons unable from lack of means |
to procure counsel. As the law i
now stands the court may appoint any
attorney to defend an indigent prisoner
at the bar and the only compensation
the attorney has is the small measure
of gltrry he may reap by winning a
victory for his client. Bauer's bill pro
vides that if the defendant is accused
of any crime thai may Involve death
or life imprisonment the attorney ap
pointed to defend him shall receive $20
a day for his services. For any other
felony charge the attorney defending
the accused shall receive $10 a day,
but in each instance the attorney must
make affidavit that he has not directly
or indirectly entered into any contract
by which he is to receive further com
pensation for such services from any
; source. Only one attorney in each
case will receive the fee ln event of the
passage of the bllL
WHEELER TO BE HEARD.
Will Give His Views on Measure
Aimed at University Professors.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 4.â President
Wheeler and nearly a dozen of the
other learned professors of the Univer
sity of California will appear before the
Assembly Judiciary Committee at a
special meeting to be held next week
in relation to the bill introduced by
Gates of Oroville prohibiting the tak
ing of any fee for or the use of any of
the time of a professor of the universi
ty in making private research or
analysis for hire.
When the bill was introduced it
should have been referred to the Uni
versity Committee, the proper one for
all such measures. A request was
made, though, that It go to the Ju
diciary Committee and, as the requests
of authors of bills as to reference are
usually heeded, the Speaker so re
ferred it.
Waste is chairman of the University
Committee and he heard that Gates
had made a remark that he didn't
want the bill to go before that commit
tee, as it would be "stifled" there.
When the bill was called up in the Ju
diciary Committee Waste demanded
that Qates retract his alleged state
ment.
"I made no such statement," said
Assemblyman Gates. "Furthermore, I
do rot care anything about this bill.
It was handed to me with a request
that I Introduce it."
PROFESSIONAL COLLECTORS.
Tn-o Bills Are Introduced ln Assembly
to Curb Their Rapacity.
BACRAMENTO, Feb. 4.â Two bills

Busick that if passed will go a long
way toward curbing rapacious bill col

lectors and others that take advantage
of the ignorance of law on; the part of
their victims. The records of this (
i county are particularly prolific of judg
i ments obtained in outside townships on
outlawed and. unjust claims, where the
defendants, being either ignorant of the
law or absent in other parts of the
State, have had judgment taken
against them and been put to endless
trouble before they could legally ex
plain their position. Usually they have
been forced to enter into a compromise
I to the advantage of the plaintiff, woh
nine times out of ten is a professional
collector, whose canvassers dug up the
claim out of some ancient and almost
forgotten controversy.
The bills introduced by Assemblyman
Busick provide that where actions arÂ»
commenced ln Justices' Courts where \
the court has no jurisdiction of the per- i
son or subject matter of said action ,
there shall be added as part of the i
costs of the defendant, to be assessed j
I against the plaintiff, an attorney fee ol
\ not less than $10 as a penalty therefor,
| and it shall be the duty of the Justice
j before whom such action was com
| menced to assess said costs and cause
i the same to be entered as a Judgment
I against the plaintiff and in favor of
the defendant.
The bill also provides that where a
default has been entered in a township
where it does not properly belong or
where the court has not jurisdiction of
the person or subject matter of the ac
tion, then the defendant may, at any
time within two years, move the court
before whom the action is pending to
vacate and set aside the judgment, and
upon a proper showing the court must
vacate and set aside the same. It is
further provided that the earnings of
the Judgment debtor for his personal
services rendered at any time within
thirty dayÃ next preceding the levy of
the execution or attachment, when it
appears that such earnings are neces
sary for the support of the defendant's
family, are exempt except where the
debts are incurred for the common
necessaries of life and the defendant's
earnings are at least $100 a month, then
one-quarter of such earnings are sub
ject to execution to satisfy the debt.
The bills have the support of many
of the most prominent attorneys of this
and other cities of the State â of attor
i neys who have given their time with
' out charge in defeating for unfortu
nates the efforts of collectors and hun
%ry lawyers to loot them of their homes
or deprive them of their small means
of subsistence.

WASHINGTON. Jan. Wireless
telegraphy haÂ« become such a potent fao
tor In the day's doings that the Govern-
ment proposes to use it in both peace and
â war. President Roosevelt's Cabinet has
taken the matter in hand and the admin-
istration's views have been embodied in
a bill drafted by the Commissioner of
Navigation, assisted by Captain Seabury
of the navy and others. Government sta-
tions are prohibited from competing for
commercial messages with regular com-
mercial wireless stations.
VANCOUVER, B. C Feb. 3.â Marconi
wireless system is being installed on the
Canadian Pacific Railway steamers ply-
ing on the Pacific and between here and
the Orient. The Empress liners will
work in connection with the high power
station which will be established at some
suitable point on the British Columbia
coast.
CHICAGO. Jan. Johann Hoch. al-
leged wholesale bigamist and wife-mur-
derer. Is believed to be on one of the At-
lantic liners and the Chicago police have
sent wireless messages from the Marconi
stations along the 'Atlantic Coast to
every steamer that left port within the
last three days. The messages have
caused great excitement on a score of
Atlantic liners, each of which has been
searched for Hoch. No trace of the man.
however. has as yet been found, the
steamers sending "Marconigrams" that
he was not among their passengers.
The Police Department is enthusiastic
on the success and dispatch with which
they received their replies from all parts
of the Atlantic by Marconi wireless.
NEW irk. Jan. 11. â With her bow
stove in and forward windlass twisted,
the Belgravia, of the Hamburg- American
Line, arrived to-day with a tale of six
fours' experience in a hurricane that al-
most threw her 1820 steerage passengers
into a panic. When the officers went be-
low to quiet them they listened intently
to the assurances given them that they
were in communication by Marconi wire-
less with other vessels and the land, and
could receive aid at any time should it
be necessary, and these assurances that
the steamer was in no danger of sinking
soon allayed J.heir fears.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 4â4 â A * a result
of Admiral Togo s demonstration in the
blockade of Port Arthur of the value of
wireless telegraphy in war, exhaustive 1
tests will be one of the features of win-
ter maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea.
l.ines of communication will be estab-
lished through scout cruisers sent four
or five hundred miles, or even farther in I
different directions. The opposing squad- i
rons will be equipped with wire-Jess ap- '
paratus and each fleet will try to outdo
the other in sending the messages the I
. longest distances.
The foregoing telegrams, showing the
progress of the Marconi system, have re- i
cently appeared in the press of the coun- I
try.
Successful communication was main- 1
tamed for several hours yesterday be-
tween the Marconi station in San Fran-
cisco and the U. S. battleship "Ohio" as
she left the harbor on her way out tc sea.
The messages were received up to 150
miles. It was the most successful test
of wireless telegraphy ever made on the
Pacific Coast and one of the most unique
tests ever made anywhere. Never before i
have Maroon been received from
such a distance in the heart of a big city I
Dots and dashes flew all day long over
the skyscrapers and over the hills of San
Francisco. At 1:30 p. m. the "Ohio" an- I
nounced that she was 37 miles out of the
harbor. The distance at 6:30 p. m. was
150 miles. Numerous messages of a
business and personal nature were re- i
corded on the tape. >
Many of the readers of this article had
the opportunity a few years ago of in-
vesting in Bell Telephone stock, and 5100 I
invested then would have netted them to I
date a profit of over 5200.000. Marconi
securities, taken now, offer as great an
opportunity. The investment is as safe '
88 a bank and certain to pay vastly more i
in dividends. ]
The Marconi Company is already in re i
ceipt of considerable and constantly in- I
creasing revenues. There are alfeadv '
over S5O Marconi stations In commercial
operation, earning money every day. . As
an illustration, during a recent trip of
the steamer "Lucania" over $800.00 in '<
tolls was collected. It is. therefore, safo
to estimate that each ship installation
â will show a net profit of $5000 to $10 000
Â«>'<*Â«â . which, multiplied by the number '.
of ships, will amount to several hundred :
thousand dollars annually.
It is estimated that the forwarding of
press news for the "Ocean Daily." pub-
< M e( L on board the trans-Atlantic liners
will give an annual profit to the com-
pany of at least $750,000. â '
The Marconi Company will derive Its
largest profits from its trans-Atlantic
service. There are 14 trans-Atlantic ca-
bles in the United States, handling &\l
Ihe traffic they are capable of handling
at 25 cents a word. It is not unreason^
able to expect that with 14 trans- Atlantic
Marconi stations the profit will be over '
510,006,000, making possible a net profit I
for dividends of 150 per cent on the en- !
tire capitalization from that branch of
the business alone. . . j
The magnitude of the telegraph busi- *
ness Is best evidenced by the fact tint '
an average of 1.000,000 telegrams are
sent every day throughout the year ThÂ«^
shows- that the possibilities of the wire
less telegraph are practically unlimited
The cost of Installation, maintenance '
and operation of the Marconi system is
fo small compared with that of the ca _ ,
Me and wire systems that it can afford
to transmit messages for LESS THAV
HALF the price of the old systems
Therefore It . stands to - reason that the
' public always gives the preference to the
cheaper rate.

REMARKABLE CAREER
OF A FRENCH LEADER
M. Paul Doumer
Wins Wag to
the Top.
SON OF POOR MAN
Begins Life as
an Engraver's
Apprentice.
BpÂ«clAl DiÂ«patch to ThÂ« Call.
PARIS, Feb. B.â Paul Doumer, the
new president of the Chamber of Depu
ties, is the most brilliantly successful
type of self-made man in France to
day. An ex-Minister, ex-Governor of
Indo-China, one of the foremost states
; men of France and in the opinion of
1 many the likeliest successor of Loubet
as President of the republic, Doumer is
; the son of a petty railroad employe. He
came to Paris at the age of 14 years
i seeking his fortune. Ready to try his
hand at anything, young Paul entered
an engraver's shop as an apprentice.
He soon became so expert that he was
given his certificate as a workman and
gained admission to a big medal fac
. tory. Here, having his evenings to him
| self, he started in to perfect his hith
i erto neglected education. At the age of
21, having meanwhile lost not a day
from his work, he passed his examina
tions before the University of Paris
and received the license of sciences de
gree, entitling him to admission to the
1 state schools as professor.
For some years young Doumer taught
in the French provinces. Then a phy
sical weakness threatened to cut short
his career. His voice failed under the
constant strain of lecturing and he was
afflicted with periods of aphonia. Fin
ally he was compelled to renounce his
chair. Nothing daunted, he decided to
turn his education to another purpose
by taking up politics, using journalism
as a medium. He became an editor,
and resigned this post only to enter the
Chamber of Deputies in 1888, flying the
Kadical flag. He had gone in at a spe
cial election to succeed a dead Deputy.
At the general elections the year fol
lowing he was defeated. But then a re
markable tribute was paid to his talent.
The President of the new chamber,
Floquet, Invited Doumer to become the
head of his private cabinet, so that
Doumer remained in the chamber al
though he had lost his seat. At the
next election Doumer was re-elected
Deputy and interested himself particu
larly in the questions of municipal un
ions, % proposed general reform of the
treasury and workingmen's co-opera
tive societies.
In 1895 Premier Bourgeois intrust
ed to Doumer the portfolio of Fin
ance, and Doumer defended the proj
ect for the income tax. When the
Bourgeois Cabinet fell and the Me
line Cabinet followed the next year
Doumer was appointed Governor of
Indo-China.
ENERGETIC GOVERNOR.
It is stated by all who have follow
ed Indo-Chinese affairs and the
French colonial question generally
that Doumer was the best Colonial
Governor France has ever had. En
dowed with sufficient energy to inves
tigate conditions for himself and see
where possibilities for improvement
lay, he also had sufficient courage to
carry out the reforms which he found
to be necessary. He reorganized the
entire administration of his colony,
opened up new roads, built railroads,
improved the welfare of the colonists,
put them on good terma with the na
tives, sternly suppressed all abuses of
power or irregularities among petty
officials and made himself, in a word,
the executive as well as the nominal
head. He also was the first to realize
Japan's pan-Asiatic ambitions and the
serious menace which they would be
to all European powers having colo
nial possessions in Asia, and he or
ganized Indo-China so as to be in a
position to withstand a Japanese in
vasion, which he still considers would
have come already if Japan's atten
tion had not been more imperatively
called to Manchuria and Russia.
As he pursued his work, however,

TREATMENT OF PILES.
Permanence of Cure the True Test
Many so-called pile remedies will
afford the user slight temporary relief
and the majority of those afflicted do
not expect more than this.
The average sufferer, after having
tried every preparation recommended
for the cure of piles, conies to the con-
rlâ lnn that there is no cure except
an operation and rather than undergo
this "last resort" he suffers on, re-
signed to the situation, so far as may
be. The attention of those interested
ir invited to the following experience:
"After ten years of suffering from
bl;nd. bleeding and protruding piles
and after using every remedy I could
lifar of without any benefit, I finally
bought a fifty-cent box of Pyramid
Pile Cure and used it with such good
results I bought a dollar box. which
finished up the job. That was nearly
six years ago and as far as piles is
concerned I am cured and have never
felt a symptom of them since.
"Many others have used this remedy
by my advice with the same results
and I always recommend it to suf-
ferers with piles." â C. H. Potts, Bur-
lii i? ton. Kans.
Testimony like this should convince
the most skeptical the Pyramid Pile
Cure not only cures, but cures to stay
cured. It is in the form of a supposi-
tory, can be applied in the privacy of
the: home, directly to the parts affected
and does its work quickly and pain-
lessly.
Druggists generally sell this famous
remedy for fifty cents a package and
sufferers are urged to buy /a package
now and give it a trial to-night Ac-
cept no substitutes.
A little book describing the causes
and care of piles is published by the
Pyramid Drug Company, Marshall
Mich., and same will be sent free to
any address for the asking

he found that he was making enemies
on every side among those who resent
ed enterprise and authority in others;
from coming into continual conflicts
with his local subordinates, he began
to see himself unjustly criticized at
home. Although this criticism never
went so far as to bring a serious
charge â Doumer is about the only
public man in France who has never
been formally accused of any real
misconduct â he decided that It would
be wiser for him to return home, and
he resigned his post, after having oc
cupied it for five years.
MODERATE IX VIEWS.
In 1902 Doumer returned to the
Chamber of Deputies and has since
been president of the Budget Commis
sion. While classing himself as a
Radical, Doumer is so moderate in his
â¢views that he counts more friends
among the moderate republicans and
even the Conservatives than he does in
the extreme radical and socialistic
ranks at the Chamber. For more than

ties of society and the heated atmos- .,
phere of crowded London drawing
rooms. Most of her time is passed at
the beautiful family seat Blithfleldâ
pronounced Bliffield â in the vale of
Blythe, near Rugeley, Staffordshire.
The park is a finely wooded one, re- j
nowned for its oak trees and Its goats,
a herd of which has been kept Ihere j
for centuries. Of gome of these Lady
Bagut has made pets and they follow i
her everywhere about the grounds. Her
charity finds its chief vent in giving
free entertainment there to parties of
poor children and their mothers from
the congested pottery districts. The
estate comprises over 30,000 acres. The
baby being a girl, the heir presumptive
is still Lord Bagot's brother, the Hon.
Walter Lewis Bagot, a major In the
Imperial Yeomanry.
Bridge has become the rage among
the Russians, who are the greatest
gamblers in the world. But they have
the solace of knowing that indulgence
in card playing, however bad it may
be for their own pockets, materially
assists a most deserving charity. The
manufacture of cards Is a Government
monopoly in Russia, and the profits
from their sale are assigned to the Red
Cross Society. Last year, according to
figures just published, the sale of cards
brought 2,000,000 roubles f$l, 000,000) to
the national exchequer, of which $850,
000 represents the share of the Red
Cross Society, the cost of their manu
facture being only $250,000. The Czar
is himself a capital player, and the
cards used by the imperial family are
made of the finest linen rags and bear a
water mark of the imperial eagle and
crown. The royal court used 1200 packs
last year, which cost $4600. Incidental
ly this shown that the Czar and his
courtiers are not exactly plunged in
gloom by the reverses which the Rus
sian arms have suffered in the Far
East. There is no gambling at the
Mikado's court.
BRIDGE STTLL POPULAR.
There are no signs of abatement In
| the popularity of, bridge here; on the
contrary it is steadily growing in fa
vor. Next month the New Almack's,
the club erf the upper tendom of both
sexes which is devoted exclusively to
the game, will open its enlarged prem
ises and take in something like a hun
dred additional aristocratic members
from the anxious waiting list. During
his recent visit the King of Portugal
had a great run of luck at bridge which
he played at Windsor and the big
country houses of the nobility whom he
visited. At Chatsworth, the principal
seat of the Duke of Devonshire, his
skill and fortune produced such hand
some results that his winnings caused
him no little embarrassment, which he
relieved by presenting the Duchess
with a set of gold jeweled bridge mark
ers. It was while he was at Chats
worth that he received a telegram from
Lisbon Informing him that he had won
$12,500 in the national lottery, it has
been the custom of the King for many
years to subscribe for several tickets,
always selecting the same numbers. It
was one of these, 2305, which drew the
prize. Truly fortune must be in a mer
ry naood with this popular monarch.

OLD CRIME IS EECALLED
Prison Directors Will Make
an Investigation to Deter
mine Truth of the Matter
Special Dtupatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 4. â An affidavit
signed and sworn to by John H. Mul
lins, a convict, may in the course of
time liberate A. J. Wade, who 1b- serv
ing a life term from Sierra County.
Wade was convicted of the murder of
Owen Williams in Sierra County in 1902.
On August 31 of that year he borrowed
a rifle from a friend with the intention
of visiting a mine on the following day.
He passed the night In a cabin and on
awaking found th.c rifle missing. A few
hours later he was arrested and
charged with the murder of Owen Wil
liams. A sight similar to the one on
the borrowed rifle was found in Wil
liams' hut. Wade was convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment at San
Quentin.
On January 29. 1903, John N. Mullins
entered San Quentin to serve a life
term for murder committed in Flumas
County. He recently informed Father
Egan that Wade was innocent of the
crime of which he was convicted.
Mullins in his affidavit declares that
in company with J. M. Blair he went to
Downieville with the intention of rob
bing the treasury. They passed through j
Sierra and Blair stopped at a cabin to
change his saddle. The cabin was in
habited by Williams, who was killed
in a quarrel by Blair. Blair, according j
to the affidavit, showed Mullins a blunt
instrument with which he said he had
killed the old man. Soon after that
they parted company.
The Prison Directors will investigate
the case.
a year he has been regarded by the
center and the right as the only man
able to break up the radico-socialist
tyranny at the Chamber, and help or
ganize a Ministry which would be to-1
erant and liberal in its views, whatever
its general line of politics might be.
To get Doumer in power the right and
center have again and again declared
themselves willing to momentarily sac
rifice parts ot their own political pro
grammes. This stfpport, with that of
the dissident radicals who consider that
Combes has gone too far in his anti
clerical policy or else that he has sac
rificed other vital points too entirely to
his own issue, secured for Doumer his
election as president of the Chamber,
beating the Government candidate,
Brisson.
Doumer* waiHÂ»orn In 185?, and is con
sequently now 47 years old. He mar
ried for love when he was 21 years
old, and now has eight children, the
eldest of whom is a lieutenant in the
French army. In spite of all the hon
ors that have come to him, Doumer has
remained simple in his daily life, and
rises every morning at 5, no matter
how late his official functions have
compelled him to be up the night be
fore.

LUMBERMEN ON ELK RIVER
WALK Ol*T OF LOGCING CAMP
Cbject to a Now Ajcrwment by Which
Tht.v Are 1,0 Pay $15 a Month
for Tlicir Board.
EUREKA, Feb. 4. â More men em
ployed at the Pinkerton logging cam,p
on Elk River walked out this morn-
Ing because of an attempted enforce
ment of an agreement entered into be
tween a majority r>f the county mills
r short time ago whereby the men are
to be charged $15 a month board.
Sume time ago the bay and-^county
lumbermen decided to raise tnÂ« wages
of the men Jlo per month and charge
them $15 for board, the Dolbeer &
Carson Company and Dan Newell of
Bayside being the only dissenters. The
men at the Pinkerton camp objected to
the change, claiming that it would
work unfairly to them, and, as they
could get no satisfaction from Su
perintendent Pinkerton, all quit work
with the exception of one man. As
tho men are unorganized the strike is
not expected to be general. Should
the strike continue the Holmes-Eureka
Mill will be involved and probably be
forced to suspend operations. Pinker
ton camp supplies the mill with logs
and the supply on hand will last bare
ly two weeks. There is considerable
dissatisf action all over the county be
rhtisp of the agreement and the trouble
may spread to the other lumbering
concerns.

HOTEL DEL CORONADO, Feb. A.â
These are days that keep the clerks at â '
the hotel office busy. Special cars, car â 
parties and excursions arrive almost
daily. Some leave a few of their mem- '
bers while the rest flit- away on a rush- \

seeing Easterners who had crossed the j
continent from the land of snow to the !
land of sun arrives here. They could ;
hardly have come at a better time, for
the rains have carpeted the hills with
green. In a day or two they will be
moving on to see what San Francisco
has to offer for their amusement.
Admiral Casper Goodrich, who is at
the' hotel while the vessels of his squad
ron are in San Diego harbor finds many
old friends here.

"JERSEY LILY"
A BIG LOSER
Eecent Win of Mrs. Langtrj^
in Haydock Park Kaces
Came in the Nick of Time
CHANGES HER METHODS
Actress Said to Have Lost
$100,000 on Eating. Stud
During Last Four Years
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 4.â Mrs. Langtry's
; victory at Haydock Park the other day
In the first race she has entered since
discarding her old track name of "Mr.
Jersey" for that of Mrs. de Bathe was
rather sorely needed, for of late the
"Jersey Lily's" luck on the turf has
, been inclined to go from bad to worse.
! The season just closed proved the most
I disastrous she has had since she began
j racing. Out of about seventy events in
i which her horses were entered they
', won 'only seven, the cpmbined stakes of
| which amounted to a meager $5000.
A well-known racing authority tells
; me that the "Jersey Lily" racing enter
; prises during the last three or four
'' years must have cost her $100,000. The
| size of her stud has shrunk steadily. In
former days she seldom had less than
| fourteen hores In training, but in 1904
she ran only five horses. And of this
: quintet the star performer died in No
i vember. This was Smilax, who won
three out of the seven races captured
, by Mrs. de Bathe during the season.
: Her other horses are Lolas, Vergia,
i Belle Saville and Seymour, who won
! over the hurdles at Haydock Park the
other day.
The stakes in this race were $2000, and
' Mr?. Langtry also added considerably
, to her bank account in the way of bets.
There always has been a strong ele-
I ment of superstition in the actress'
j character. She has always backed in a
j most spirited manner any new effort or
I enterprise in whirh she has been per
: sonally interested, and in this Instance
she backed her new racing name pretty
heavily. Though her track experience
in the past has been so discouraging,
she has stuck to the sport with a per
tinacity that has commanded the ad
i miration of all racing men. Under the
, most adverse circumstances she would
j never look disheartened, and her train
i er and Jockey always would be cheered
with the remark, "Better luck next
: time." â¢
However, Mrs. de Bathe has been
greatly encouraged by her early sue-
I cess this year, and it is understood that
1 she is arranging to increase her num
! ber of horses in training. In racing cir
cles it is said that King Edward stilt
! takes an active Interest in the "Jersey
, Lily's" track enterprises and that he
, recently suggested important anverrd
ments in her racing methods.

iIIKNS MAY HAVE TO WORK
OVERTIME IN CHICAGO
CnUl . Weather Is * Cause -of* a , Scarcity
of-Eggs In the Windy
"citrlV tS Â: : :.
CHICAGO, Feb. 4.â Chicago faces
one of the worst egg famines in its
history, according to South Water
street commission men, and the price
may go to 50 cents a dozen or higher
in a few days. The cold wave is the
cause of the shortage and It has been
of such long continuance that the
storage .supply is almost exhausted.
What few eggs are left are in the
big refrigerating plants at the stock
yards, it is said, and the owners can
charge what prices they please, as
shipments from the country are ex
pected to be almost nothing for the
next three weeks.
Some dealers now receive as much
as 30 cents for the best grade of fresh
eggs. The price of storage eggs
ranges from 18 to 23 cents a dozen.

TWO KILLED;
MANY INJURED
Peculiar Wreck Occurs on
New York Central Railroad
a Few Miles From IJtica
EXPLOSION OF BOILER
Locomotive ojf Western Ex*
press Blows Up Just as It
Is Passing Buffalo Special
UTICA, N. T., Feb. 4.â Two trainmen
lost their lives dnd a score or more pas
sengers were injured in a wreck on the
New York Central Railroad at Whites
boro, three miles west of here, at an
early hour to-day. None of the Injured
was dangerously hurt, their wounds
being mainly cuts and bruises. The
dead:
JOHN ALLEN, engineer.
JOHN BRENNAN, fireman of the lo
comotive on the Western express.
As the express was passing the Buf
falo special, eastbound, the boiler of
the locomotive of the westbound train
exploded. The force of the explosion
and the upheaval of the engine threw
the entire train of thirteen cars com
posing the special from the rails. The
westbound train did not leave the
track, but the cars stopped with a sud
denness and a shock which threw the
occupants of the berths backward with
great force, in some cases tossing them
upon the floor.
An hour or more was devoted to ex
tricating passengers from the interior
of the eastbound train sleeping cars,
but while many were found to be cut
and bruised, no one was killed.
Among the injured was State Su
preme Court Justice Warren- B. Hooker
of Fredonia. He was severely bruised.
Among the others injured were Walter
L. Brown and William J. Robinson of
Buffalo and Robert Weiland and Sidney
J. West of New York, /Dr. Walsh of
New York and Mrs. Bell of Buffalo,
wife of the superintendent of the Pull
man Car Company.
From the fact that Fireman Brennan
was instantly killed and that Engineer
Allen lived but a few minutes the cause
of the explosion probably will never be
known. Both men lived in Albany.
The strangest feature of the accident,
as it appeared to an onlooker, was that
the boiler of the westbound locomotive
was resting midway between the rails
of the eastbound track at a point where
the eastern train had passed. This sug
gested the theory to trainmen that the
boiler had struck the second car of the
eastbound train as it rushed by at the
rate of fifty miles an hour, the blow
causing all the following cars to be
hurled from the track.

Decrease of $4,000,000 in
Cash Keserves in Banks
NEW YORK. Feb. 4.â Realizing 1
sales for the end of, the week were in
considerable force during the short
session of the stock . market to-day
and finally overcame the market,
making the closing; weak and a point
below last night for some 'â¢ of : the
speculative leader* The Pennsylva
nia group and the Pacifies; including
Missouri Pacific, were especially af
fected by the profit taking. / "
There was as little to account for
the selling as there has been for the
buying so far as news bearing on the
properties was concerned. The bank
statement may have contained a sug
gestion that the present redundancy
of money will not continue indefinite
ly under the operation of forces now
at work. The week's outgo of gold in
spite of the Inflow from the interior
caused the expected decrease of over
$4,000,000 In cash reserves In the
banks. The loan expansion of $12,
443,600 lifted the level of deposits and
the reserve requirements at the same
time so as to furnish the net result of
a shrinkage of $7,137,625 in th* sur
plus reserve of the banks. â¢
The progress of efforts toward se
curing consolidated party action on
the Federal control of freight rates
had some effect on sentiment and may
'have prompted the growing selling
movement. The notable price move
ments of the day were in stocks of
minor importance and the receding j
tendency became quite general before |
the closing. Total sales of bonds, par |
value, $2,795,000.
There has been an active and ag
gressive speculation in stocks this
week resulting in record prices for a
number,, of securities and high prices
on this movement for. more. Huge '
profit taking and large sales for the
short account have Interrupted the
rise at times and induced some consid
erable reactions. . .' 'â¢
The restraint on the Western stocks
was in part attributable to the Influ
ence of the granting of the petition to
review the decision of the lower court
in the .-Northern-. Securities case, which
was granted" by the Supreme Court on
Monday. The granting of the peti
tion has the effect of tying up the

What Sulphur Does
For tbe Human Body In Health
and L isease.
The mention ot sulphur will recall
Lto many of us the e*rly days when
, our mothers and grandmothers gav-^
us our daily dose of sulphur and
, molasses every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
! "blood purifier," tonic and cur*-all,
I and, mind you, this old-fashioned
remedy was not without merit.
The Idea was good, but the r<Â»me<Jy
was crude and unpalatable and a iarga
quantity had to be taken lo get any
effect.
Nowadays we yet all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective than a tabrespoon-
ful of tha crude sulphur.
In recent years research and ex-
periment have proven that the beat
1 sulphur for medicinal use Is that ob-
tained from Calcium. (.Calcium Sul-
phide) and sold in drug stores unde"
the name of Stuart's Calcium Wafers.
They are small, chocolate-coated pel-
lets and contain tha active medicinal
principle of sulphur In a highly con-
centrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of tha valu-
of this form of sulp-hur in res:
â¢ and maintaining bodily vigor and
1 health; sulphur acts directly on th-
liver and excretory organs and purifies
' and enriches the blood by the prompt
elimination of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with srulphur and mo-
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary
flowers of sulphur were often worse
than the disease and cannot compare
with the modern concentrated prepa-
, rations of sulphur, of which Stuart's
i Calcium Wafers Is undoubtedly the
best and most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
stipation and purify the blood in a way
I that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wllkins. while exparlment-
1 Ing with sulphur remedies, soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium wa*
; superior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles.
: especially when resulting from con-
stipation or malaria, I have been sur-
i prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
! suffering: from boils and pimples and
I even deep-seated carbuncles, I have
repeatedly seen them dry up and dis-
appear In four or five days, leaving; th<,>
skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers Is a proprie-
tary article and sold by druggists and
for that reason tabooed by many phy-
sicians, yet I know of nothing- so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forma of skin diseases as this remedy."
At any rate people who are dretf of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers" will find In Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, rnort palat-
able and effective preparation.

PIONEER WOMEN
RECEIVE HOST
OF FRIENDS
SALLY SHARP
Redolent with memories of "the days
of gold, the days of old, the days of
'49." Pioneer Hall has seldom been so
gay as yesterday, for it was the an
nual foregathering of the Auxiliary of
Pioneer Womenâ they who helped blaze
the way to the ocean's edge, even for
thee and me. Yesterday did the grand
dames of oar Western city gather to
gether to exchange greetings among
themselves and their friends â and of
the latter thÂ«re were legions.
Pioneer Hall was never so fair in its
garland ot green and to the honor of '
Mrs. Fernando Pfingst, Miss O'Cal
laghan and Miss Anne O'Callaghan be
it said. It was their fingers that
wrought the wonder of transforming a
bleak hall into a drawing-roomâ for
such in truth it was, with its wealth
of rugs, divane, graceful palms and its
wilderness of greenery. Blossoms there
were, tooâ loads of violets and daffo
dils, beautiful in their springtime
freshness.
During the reception hours a stringed
orchestra gave forth sweet melody
from behind a tangle of palms. Mrs.
Reginald Brooke, whose parents were
among the California pathfinders, gave
several songs in charming manner â a
manner all her own.
Mrs. Harry Sherwood's lute solo,
with a violin obligato by Warner Sher
wood, was also a fetching number.
The reception committee was com
posed of the following ladies: Mrs.
John Burnett, Mrs. T. W. Holliday.
Mrs. Louis Aldrich, Mrs. S. S. Weth
ered, Mrs. J. C. Tucker, Mrs. Eleanor

ger, Mrs. J. H. Jewett, Mrs. Christian
Reis and Mrs. J. J. Brice.
As for gowning, these women were
it: smart array â many of whom, by
the way, have seen the city grow from
its swaddling clothes.
Prominent among the guests were
the officers of the Protet â the dear
Protet â with Commander Adigard
quite the hero of the hour.
Delicious refreshments were served
from 4 to 7 o'clock in the erstwhile
Palm Garden, the pioneers who wan
dered In â the lada among them â being
pressed into service to assist in dis
pensing ye olde time hospitality.
It was good to see! And may the
same good time be with us next year,
and the same good people. Here's to
the Pioneer Women, may their mem
ories never fade!

LAWYKRS IMPATIENTLY
AWAIT GOVERNOR'S ACTION
Supreme Justices Assign Four Hun-
dred Cases to the New
Court** of Appeal.
The lawyers note that the Governor
is taking ample time to consider the
merit and fitness of the applicants for
judgeship of the new courts of appeal.
It is the common Impression now that
thr appointments will not be an
nounced until the Legislature has pro
vided means for maintaining the ma
chinery of the courts. The Supreme
Court, however, is going ahead on the
theory that the courts were created
when the amendment to the constitu
tion pro%'iding for such creation
was adopted by the people. Al
ready 400 cases have been assigned to
the appellate courts and other assign
mtnts will be made from time to time.
A large number of the assigned cases
have been sent to the court which em
braces San Francisco in the district
boundaries.
There is gossip to the effect that the
appointments are already framed In
th- (Juvernor's mind and that tho for
tunate applicants are: San Francisco
district â Judges Cooper, Harrison and
Garber; Sacramento district â Judges
Burnett, Middlecoff and Chipman;
Loh Angeles district: â Judges Allen,
Gray and Smith.
Supporters of Judge Henry A. Mel
vin of Alameda, Edward M. Sweeney
of Shasta, Judge Mannon of Mendo
cino and Judge Shaw of San Diego are
not inclined to accept the gossip as a
true forecast of the Governor's inten
tions.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBKUARV 5, 1905,
FEUD OF GENERALS
AT FRONT DISTURBS
CZAR'S WAR STAFF
Kuropatkin May Relinquish Command of
* the Manchunan Army.
BLAMES GRIPENBERG FOR LATE FAILURE
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 4. â In
terest in the ill-starred attempt to
capture Sandepas is eclipsed by the
withdrawal of General Gripenberg
and unconfirmed reports regarding
the retirement of General Kuropat
kin.
According to the latest information
received by the War Office, operations
on the right flank of the Russian army
are at a standstill. The extreme right
of the Russians continues to hold
Chiantsanhenan, on the Hun River,
six miles northwest of Sandepas. Ap
parently both sides are unable to
move on account of the terrible wea
ther. There are 25 degrees of frost,
accompanied by wind, but in view of
the sudden fluctuations in temperature
at this time of the year the frost may
suddenly decrease and the Russians
would then be confronted with the al
ternative of withdrawing in order to
avoid being intercepted by a Japan
ese column from Shilikhe or of under
taking a general advance. The lat
ter view finds some confirmation in
a dispatch from Tsinkhetehen, report
ing a reconnaissance by General Ren
nenkampff's force on the Russian left,
which perhaps is preliminary to an
advance.
The military authorities here are
encouraged by the report, as showing
that the Russians are able \o repeat
the plan of reaching the enemy's line
of communication.
Rumors of General Kuropatkin hand
ing over his command to General Line
vitch, commander of the first army, have
been current in St. Petersburg since the
announcement that General Gripenberg
had been relieved of his command of
the second army. The press is unable
to obtain confirmation of the reports.
The War Office declares they are im
mediately improbable, but is unable to
deny them. Evidently there has been
some friction between General Kuro
patkin and General Gripenberg.
There are two conflicting versions of
the incident. According to one of them
General Gripenberg complained to the
Emperor that General Kuropatkin had
refused to support his flanking move
ment, in view of which Gripenberg
asked to be relieved. The Emperor, it
is addted. then telegraphed to Kuropat
kin asking for an explanation, in reply
to which Kuropatkin wired that his
health was shattered and requested
permission to turn over his command
to Genereal Llnevitch.
According to the second and more
commonly credited version of the af
fair Kuropatkin complained to the Em
peror that General Gripenberg under
took the flanking movement in defiance
of orders and demanded the general's
dismissal.
General Kuropatkin, telegraphing un
der date of February 3 to Emperor
Nicholas, said:
"The village of Chautandhenau was
completely occupied by our troops after
a fight at 6 o'clock this morning. We
reconnoitered the villages of Fanshen
and Pudzova, occupied by the enemy,
and after several volleys the sharp
shooters entered Fanshen and shot and
bayonetted many Japanese. The latter
were reinforced and attacked the sharp
shooters, who retired, carying off their
dead and wounded. On our right flank
the Japanese left 100 corpses, of which
number we buried eighty-seven."
A later dispatch from General Kuro
patkin, dated February 3. says:
"No reports of further encounters
have been received. One of our patrols
blew up the railway eight miles south
of Liaoyang on January 31 and Feb
ruary 2."
KI'ROPATKIN LACKS DECISION.
German Military Experc Criticizes the
Russian Commander.
BERLIN, Feb. 4.â Colonel Gaedke,
for the first time since his return from
the Far East, where he was war corre
spondent for the Tageblatt, has writ
ten his opinion of General Kuropatkin.
"Although a through and through
honorable man, benevolent, personally
brave, admirable in the Quiet of his
work-room, simple in his tastes and an
excellent administrator, Kuropatkin
lacks that glance that penetrates the
darkness of a situation, quick decision,
immediate correlation of means, and,
before all, the unsympathetic will that
alone triumphs in war â that without
compassion uses the bodies and souls
of his men in taking their last and best
to encompass victory," he says. "Such
men as Kuropatkin are not few in the
Russian Army, and their qualities at
tach the soldier to his flag, but they
do not win victories. Kuropatkin at
Liaoyang burdened his mind with plac
ing individual regiments, battalions
and batteries and lost thereby the con
ception of the whole."
Colonel Gaedke regards Kuropatkin
as over-cautions and concludes:
"No leader Is so bad as he who will
not take a risk."
STOESSEL IS INDIGNANT.
Accuses British Correspondent of Jog
gling With Truth.
COLOMBO, Ceylon, Feb. 4.â General
Stoessel, the former commander of Port
Arthur, and the Russian officers and
others accompanying him arrived here
to-day from Japan. In an interview
the general denied the statements pub
lished to the effect that Port Arthur
was surrendered prematurely. He
was especially indignant at the state
ments made by a London newspaper on
January 26, in a dispatch from Peking,
that there were at the time of the sur
render 25,000 able-bodied men in Port
Arthur capable of making a sortie;
hundreds of officers, all well nourished
plenty of ammunition, the largest mag
azine being untouched and full to the
roof, and that there was an ample sup
ply of food for three months, even if
no fresh supplies were received. The
general characterized these statements
as unjustified and not supported by
facts.
Colonel Reiss, who was among the
negotiators of ' the surrender of the
fortress, said:
"The garrison could not have held
out a moment longer. It would have
been murder. Only fifteen roubles re
mained in the military treasury out of
a million and a half at the commence
ment of the siege. Four hundred men
were dying daily at the hospitals, prin
cipally from wounds and scurvy- Gen-
Kondratenko was the hero of the
siege."
Colonel Reiss further declared that the
Japanese were 'admirable soldiers, but
poor in the use of the bayonet, com
pared with the Russians and French."
General Stoessel and others of his
party will transship at Port Said for
Odessa.
BURYING RUSSIAN DEAP-
Japanese Inter Nine Hundred Bodies
on Battlefield.
RUSSIAN HEADQUARTERS, Huan
Mountain. Manchuria, Friday, Feb. 3.
The artillery engagement has been re
sumed on the Russian right.
TOKIO, Feb. 4â The Manchurian
headquarters, telegraphing under date
of February 3, says:
"On Thursday, February 2, the
enemy's .artillery bombarded tfrom
several points our right wing. Other
wise the situation is unchanged. In
the direction of our center at 12:30
o'clock this morning one company of
the enemy's infantry attacked our out
posts from the Mukden road and later
another section was attacked in the
neighborhood of Wanchiayuantzu.
Both attacks were repulsed.
"In the direction of our left the
enemy has been attacking since the
mornifig of February 2. Their force,
â¼â¢hich consisted of thp First and Fifth
Rifle brigades, was driven back. The
enemy's losses are estimated at 700.
We witnessed the removal of more
than 300 dead.
"The Russian dead already interred
after the battle of Heikoutal. in the
neighborhood of Sumpao alone, num
ber 900."
PRISONERS BROUGHT IN.
Russians Capture Two Hundred Jap-
anese on the Slmkhe.
MUKDEN, Feb. Though there is
a momentary pause in the operations,
Russian activity on the Shakhe River
has not ended. Two hundred Japanese
prisoners were brought in to-day. They
were badly dressed and suffering from
cold.
The Japanese report that 500 Rus
sians were taken prisoners during the
Sandepas operations is untrue and
the Japanese lasses greatly exceed the
Tokio estimates of the Russian losses,
because in their advance over the froz
en ground it was impossible for the
Japanese to entrench.
The report that General Kuropatkin
received orders from St. Petersburg to
advance on account of the internal con
ditions in Russia also is untrue. The
fighting was begun independently, and
the operations could have assumed im
portant dimensions only in case of *he
success of their primary object, the
capture jt Sandepas.
RECONNAISSANCE IN FORCE.
Slavs Capture Vantze Pass and Then
Are Driven Out.
TSINKHETCHEN, M&nchuria, Thurs
day, Feb. 2.â A reconnaissance in force
â was undertaken on February 1 by the
Russian advanced post toward Dziant
ehan, fourteen mllea southeast of
Tsinkhetehen. The troops started at
early morning and by noon drove in the
Japanese to Santziache. Then, moving
around Vantze Pass, the Russians
flanked the Japanese position from the
east and compelled the Japanese to fall
back to Chapten Pass. The Russians
stormed and occupied a portion of
Vantze Pass at 10:50 a. m., but the
Japanese being reinforced by 6000 men
the position of the Russians was un
tenable. Having carried out the mis
sion of feeling the enemy's strength,
the Russians then withdrew fighting,
capturing a few Japanese.
PRISONERS WEIjL TREATED.
Japanese War Department Denies Re-
ported Accusations.
TOKIO, Feb. 4.â The War Depart
ment to-day issued an extended state
ment in denial of charges that Russian
prisoners in Japan have been mistreat
ed. These charges were alleged to
have been contained in letters written
by prisoners who belonged to the
cruiser Rurik of the Vladivostok squad
ron. It was said that the letters were
smuggled out in bamboo canes'.
The statement denies that any pris
oner was struck, as alleged; declares
that the Russian wounded receive thr
same treatment as the Japanese wound
ed, and says that the food given the
prisoners is of a more expensive qual
ity than the fare of the Japanese sol
diers.
PEACE RUMOR OVERWORKED.
LONDON, Feb. 4.â The Foreign Of
fice declares there is no foundation for
the report that conferences have taken
place at Berlin between Chancellor yon
Bulow and the British Bmbassador,
Sir Frank Lascelles, with the object
of bringing about peace between Rus
sia and Japan.
BERLIN, Feb. 4.â The London report
tha.t Emperor William considers this
an opportune moment for Great Brai
tain and Germany to Join in an effort
for peace in the Far East is treated
by the Foreign Office here as being
merely a variation of an old phantasy
quite without semblance of foundation.
EXPERTS MAKE
MANY MISTAKES
DENVER, Colo., Feb. 4.â For the first
time sine* the Peabody gubernatorial
contest began before the Joint legis
lative commlttaa a hearing was held to
day in the morning, so that a night ses
sion could be dispensed with.
A number of witnesses, both Demo
cratia and Republican, to-day identified
ns their own ballots which experts
had declared to be fraudulent. Attor
ney P. J. c. Kobinson, a Republican
election Judge, Identified his, ballot
among forty Republican ballots which
an expert had declared werÂ« written
by the samo person.
The witness declared that it was ab
solutely impossible that these ballots
bad been switched.
On examining the list of fifty Dem
ocratic and forty Republican names
corresponding to the ballots which Ex
pert Fleury reported were in one hand
writing, the witness declared that he
was personally acquainted with forty
five of the Democrats and thirty-five
of the Republicans and knew that they
voted at that precinct on election day.
The other ten he knew were legally
registered, but did not know them per
sonally.
William C. Lyons, convicted of being
an accessory to illegal voting at the
November election, to-day -withdrew his
motion for a new trial, and Judge
Frank T. Johnson sentenced him to
jail for six months. Lyons was a clerk
in the City Auditor's office.
Guy Ci. Wheeler and Charles B.
liueve, election officers, weYe convict
ed to-day of breaking the seals of bal
lots and were sentenced to jail for six
months each.
The star witness of the afternoon was
Mrs. Kate Hogan. Although a Demo
crat, she had acted as a Republican
watcher in precinct 14, ward 6. on
election day. In that precinct Expert
W. P.. Pfouts had testified that eighty
three Democratic and twenty-two Re
publican ballots were in the same hand
writing.
Mrs. Hogan stated that when she
read of charges of fraud in her precinct
she macle a personal canvass, and out
of 350 people who voted she checked
up 347. The others she could not find
and understood they had moved.

AGENTS AFTER
SMUGGLER RING
Secret service agents of the Govern
ment are said to have unearthed exten
sive Custom-house frauds in the im
portation of goods from the Orient and
according to one source of information
a large wholesale firm of this city is on
the verge of ruin because of the exac
tions that are to be made for viola
tions of the laws. Undervaluation of
goods in the invoices displayed to the
port officials is the chief offense of the
importers and as the Government is
severe In punishing such imposition on
it, the dissolution of this particular
firm is looked for.
Much secrecy has been maintained
by the department representatives
from Washington and it Is intimated
that the revelations they will maJie
will be far-reaching. It appears that
the authorities at Washington became
convinced that the Government was
being defrauded on a large scale, and
that misrepresentation was practiced
boldly to avoid payment of the high
duties on many articles. Secret Serv
ice men were dispatched to make in
vestigation.
Their labors are understood to have
borne fruit in marked degree. Most
of the imposition on the Government's
collectors was found in Importations
of the curios. Duties are paid on silks
for the most part by the pound, and
there could, therefore, be no great
amount of fraud committed by the im
porters of these goods.
Nathan Benta of Santa Barbara, an
Importer of Japanese curias, has al
ready walked the carpet before Collec
tor Stratton and will und<?ubtedly suf
fer heavy penalties for placing too low
a valuation on the goods he brought
across the Pacific.
Hermann's Sons' Masquerade.
Eintracht Hall was crowded last

cisco to its many friends, and at an
early hour the merry-makers were on
hand.

STRIKERS FIRE ON
THE CZAR'S
TROOPS.
FIGHT OCCURS AT LODZ
Two Soldiers Killed and Fif
teen Wounded by the
Workingmen.
BERLIN, Feb. 4.â The Lokal An
zeiyer's Kattowitz, Prussia, corre
spondent says the advent of refugees
from Russian Poland is assuming large
dimensions and that every incoming
train Is crowded, mostly with women
and children.
The strikes in Russian Poland, the
correspondent says, are still spreading,
affecting the entire industrial region
'â  from Sosnovic to Granica, on the Aus
', trian frontier. Polish newspapers es
; timate the total number of strikers at
400,000. The Lokal Anzeiger'B Warsaw
[ correspondent says:
"At Lodz to-day during the funeral of
' fifteen victims of the recent trouble* a
â  fight between workmen and the mili
tary broke out, two of the latter being
killed and fifteen wounded."
Serious labor disturbances are an
nounced from Sielce, Russian Poland,
and Lublin, si-xty miles southeast of
Warsaw.
NOBLEB ADDRESS THE CZAR.
Majority Resolution Favors the Con
tinuance of Autocracy.
MOSCOW, Feb. 4.â The Assembly of
Nobles to-day voted upon two ad
dresses to the Emperor, and the Con
servative address was adopted by a
r vote of 219 to 148. After a lengthy dis
cussion, however, the assembly decided
I to forward both the Liberal and Con
servative addresses.
The Conservative address declares
the present troublous time is not the
right moment to consider any reorgan
ization of the system of government,
I and exhorts the autocratic Emperor to
rule in consciousness of his strength,
''â  for in the greatness of hiÃ power lies
the strength and hope of the Russian
people.
A dispatch from Moscow last Wed
! nesday said that two drafts of resolu
tions were in circulation, one insisting
' only on maintenance of the autocracy
J and the other asking for political free
i dom for Russia, urging the Govern
i ment to make necessary changes In the
! law to enable a reassembly to be con
voked and appealing to the throne to
: issue a manifesto assuring the country
of its indention to take steps to this
end, without which it would be impos
j sible to restore tranquility to the coun
! try.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1905.
At a meeting on Friday it was de
cided to vote for a modified form of
address, in effect that the nobility was
eagerly awaiting a word from the Em

uniting the throne and the people were
still unbroken and that the Emperor
would, when he deemed advisable,
summon elective representatives of the
people to have a share in the Govern
ment. -
STUDENTS ARE PUNISHED.
Pole* Pay 2>early for Presuming to
Request a Reform.
WARSAW, Feb. 4.â Two hundred and
eighty pupils were expelled to-day
from the Warsaw gymnaÃium, with the
additional punishment that they will
never be permitted to enter any Gov
ernment school within the empire. This
action of the authorities is intended as
a punishment for boys who dared to
petition the directors for the introduc
tion of the Polish language into the
schools. As a result of the punishment
the boys lose the privilege of perform
ing military service as one-year volun
teers and will be forced to serve three j
or four years in the ranks.
Reports from Czestochowa, Russian
Poland, say that city is in a state of
panic. The inhabitants are barricad
ing their doors and windows in conse
quence of the attitude of the strikers.
TEAR DOWN CZAR'S SPEECH,
St. Petersburg Workmen Dismissed by
Trepoff's Order.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 4.â Less- â¢
ner's torpedo factory in this city, em- I
ploying 600 expert fitters and brass
workers, has been closed by Governor
General Trepoff, who ordered the dis
missal of the whole staff of the con
cern for having torn down posters of
the Emperor's recent speech to the
workmen's delegation and because the
manager was unable to replace these
men. The works are strongly guarded
by the police. The Adrhiralty and the
War Office have requested Governor
General Trepoff to allow the workmen
to be re-employed and it is hoped the
factory will reopen on Monday. The
men claim they tore down the postere
because the deputation which waited
on the Emperor did not include their
representatives.

NEARLY THREE MILLIONS
IS THE JANUARY RECORD
Real Estate Deals During the First
Month of the Year Amount
to $2,935,123.
Thoma* Magree & Sons in their real
estate circular report that the sales of
6aji Francisco real estate in January
emounted to 12,935,125 and numbered
634. In part the circular says:
"The flfrures for the various sections
of the city are up to the average of the
past three years with the exception of
the flfty-vara district, in â¢which the fig
urea are considerably below this aver
ac*. The occasion for the low figures
in the flfty-vara section is not a lack
of demand nor a falling off In the num
ber of persons willing and anxious to
invest In this district, but It is distinct
ly traceable to and caused by a lack of
supply of paying investments for sale.
"Many 6hrewd buyers for Inside
properties have for several years made
money by buying downtown properties
where there are old improvements tied
up with leases, building or remodeling
at the expiration of the leases and sell
ing to investors on basis of new rents.
Heavy sales of this kind for three or
four years? past have reduced such op
portunities. Thore are many more buy-

V There are any number of
people who have Varicocele
â people who are unaware

in almost certain sign ,of
varicocele. â  And what la
that? It Is the disease that
a saps, more surely than any-
thing else, the vital forces.
Do you see the weak â
emaciated man? If you do
you . may be certain that he
suffers from this dreaded
trouble â¢in some form. â¢It
appears in the scrotum.
rWhen it appears there

anywhere are always a very
distinct sign of WASTE.
Tour system is like a bank
account. You can draw on
B .. it at all times. but when It
I. is exhausted, what can you
do? The man who is nnan-
cially poor may. by hard
work, regain some share of
t the world's goods, but the
â  man who is broken in-
health through waste has .a
hard battle in front of him. '
CN see any sign of the
trouble why not "take the
bull by the herns"? Why
not say. "It is not too late"?
Would not that be wisdom?
Think it over for a minute
or two. I cure Varicocele
by my own methods. I do it
Oln a week without the use
of a knife. It cannot be
cured by any system of '
home treatment, but I say â
and I stake my professional

Atb than sellers. There were few sales
of any consequence recorded last
month, the largest being the Hale Bros,
purchase on the corner of Sixth and
Stevenson streets for somewhat less
than $250,000. Inquiry during the month
was brisk. The number of sales in the
Mission and outside lands districts and
the amount involved Indicate special
activity in these sections, while the
Western Addition and 100-vara sections
â how a good volume of business. The
early and continuous rainstorms
throughout the State give promise of
good crops, and we look for an active
spring in real estate.
"The building contracts for January
were as follows: Frame, $719,706; brick,
$1,492,679; alterations, $68,309; total. $2,

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Uricsol,
the only eyre for
Rheumatism.
If you are suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay : side your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Uricsol cures rheumatism in the
only possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
lof Rheumatism. These are deposited
â  in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
' of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
I tones up the system, stimulates the
i kidneys, liver and bowels and thus

INDICTS FIVE
FOR FORGERY
Chicago Grand Jury Returns
True Bills as Result of In
vestigation of Tunnel Plot
OLD CHANGES REVIVED
President of Corporation, a
City Official and an Alder
man Are Among Accused
CHICAGO, Feb. 4.â Albert G. Wheel
er, president of the Illinois Tunnel
Company; former City Clerk William
Loefner and Assistant City Clerk Ed
ward Erhorn were indicted to-day by
the Grand Jury on a charge of forgery
In connection with the franchise for the
underground railroad system in this
city. Alderman Edward Novak and
John Higgins, a printer, were indicted
in the same connection on charges of
perjury as well as forgery.
The indictments embrace, it is said,
the history of the granting of the tun
nel ordinance by the city. The charge
of forgery la based upon the alleged
changing of a Council report as to the
size of the tunnels and the accusations
of perjury grow out of testimony given
at a preliminary hearing In a Justice's
Court some time ago.
After the indictments were returned
Levy Mayer, counsel for Wheeler, said:
"This matter is five years old. As
the result of Wheeler's refusal to sub
mit to be blackmailed by a discharged
attorney he is Indicted. Once in 1902
and twice in 1904 an attorney made a
similar charge before different Justices
of the Peace, and in each instance the
charge was thrown out of court.

furniture: SALE
ON THE SQUARE
With many carloads of our new spring purchases arriving daily and many more to come, we find
our large sample rooms encumbered with a lot of styles whose room is preferred to their com-
pany. â '.;.'..'.- â /.' V.v r
For some reasonâ puzzle even to experts â many of these styles have not sold well during the
past few, months. Maybe only an accident â who would like them haven't seen them,
perhaps. There is nothing wrong with them; anyway, as. to make and quality; and as to pat-
tern or design â that, as you know, is a matter of taste. Some of the patterns we are now of-
fering at a little over half their value we expected to become leading sellers. Of many of these
styles we bought altogether too many to begin with. / >
Of others, that have sold largely, we have just the sample piece or set left. Anyway all
must â and go this week. We cannot illustrate or even mention all of them. They have
been marked with blue tags, and the original plain-figure price tags also remain.
What we paid for. the ! goods is of no consequence now. We have j.
only considered : What will they bring at onee â for cash or ./j^^ba.

TOCB HVM'KISIA
A CURE FOR ALL.
Not a Patent Cui-e-AH, Nor a Modern
Miracle, but Shnx)ly.a. National
Cure lor Dyspepsia.
In' these days of numbuggery and de- i
cepuoa, the manufacturers of patent I
in<x!^c!nes. as a rule, seem to think
their medicines will not Bell unless they 111 1
< laim.that.it: will cure every disease!
under the sun. And they never think i
to. leavmg out dyspepsia and stomach I
troubles. They are sure to claim that
i heir nostrum is absolutely certain to !
cnxÂ» every dyspeptic and he need look i
no lurthcr. <
In the face of these absurd claims it
is refreshing to note that the proprie-
tors of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have
carefully- refrained from making any
undue claims or false representations
regarding the merits of this most ex-
cellent remedy for dyspepsia and stom-
ach troubles. They make but one
claim for It, and that is, that for indi-
gestion and various etomach troubles
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is a radical
cure. They go no further than this
and any man or woman suffering from
indigestion, chronic or nervous dyspep-
sia, who will give the remedy a
trial will find that nothing is claimed
for it that the facts will not fully bus-
tain. ~ V.- :Z :
It is a modern discovery, composed of
harmless vegetable ingredients accept-
able to the weakest or most delicate
stomach. Its great success in curing
etomach troubles is due to the fact
that the medicinal properties are such
that it will digest whatever wholesome
food Is taken into the stomach, no
matter whether the stomach is in good
working order or not. It rests the
overworked organ and replenishes the
body, the blood, the nerves, creating a
healthy appetite, giving refreshing
sleep and the blessings which always
accompany a good digestion and
proper assimilation of food,
In using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
no dieting is required. Simply eat
plenty of wholesome food and take
these Tablets at each meal, thus assist-
ing and resting the stomach, which
rapidly regains its proper digestive
power, when the Tablet will be no
longer required.
Ntrrous Dyspepsia It simply a con-
dition In which some portion â¢or por-
tions of the nervous svÃtem are not
properly nourished. Good digestion in-
vlgoratee the nervous system and
every organ In the body.
Stuart'B Dyspepsia Tablets are sold

JURY ANSWERS
LABOR'S LETTER
Foreman Andrews Explains
Why Certain Cheap Show
houses Are Kept Closed
THE LAW IS VIOLATED
Drastic Measures Said toi
Be Necessary for Protec
tion of General Public!
The Grand Jury has answered the
communication addressed to that body
Ijy the California State Federation of
Labor. The federation took the stand
that the closing of certain of the 10-eent
theaters was a hardship on the work
ingrman and his family, inasmuch as
the places of amusement in question
furnished at a minimum of expense
recreation for poor people. T. P. An
drews, foreman of the Grand Jury, yes
terday sent the federation the following
letter:
"Harry A. Knox Esq., president; F.
J. Bonnington, secretary, executive
council California State Federation of
Labor, 1067 Market street, San Francis
co, Cal.â Dear Sirs: Replying to your
commuhicatlon of recent date contain
ing a resolution purporting to issue
from the executive council of the Cali
fornia State Federation of Labor, in the
form of a protest against the alleged
closing by the Grand Jury of certain
theaters in this city and county 'with
out giving the owners an opportunity
to comply with their views of the law,'
permit us to say: That it ia the sworn
duty of the Grand Jury to Inquire into
violations of the statutes of our Sate
and the ordinances of our city. That
we are not permitted to take the views
of individuals as to how theaters should
be constructed, but must be guided by
the experience of years, looking to the
safeguarding of the lives of the people
who visit the theaters of our city. That
in the construction of the theaters to
which your resolution refers practically
every provision of the law has been
violated. That where the use of fire
proof material is called for wood has
been utilized. That proper and safe ex
its have not been provided. That the
said theaters are located in buildings
of a character prohibited by ordinances.
That at least four of the places referred
to in your resolution have been report
ed upon as unsafe by the Inspectors of
the Board of Public Works. That the
law in its wisdom, and for the safety
of our citizens, provides that before
such places of amusement can open
they must obtain a license, and that
such license must not issue unless a
certificate as to safety is procured from
the Board of Public Works. That such
certificate has been refused In the case
of most of the theaters referred to, and
they are now being run without a li
cense and in open violation of the law.
"That in the ease of the Bahi^vln The
ater a city building Inspector reported
at the time when alterations upon the
building In which It is conducted were
begun that it was impossible to open
a theater there and have it conform to
the ordinances. That notwithstanding
this report the work was proceeded
with and the law flagrantly violated in
every Â©articular.
"The Grand Jury cannot sit by and
see this done. Tour organization, and
the men who compose it, we know do
not, and cannot, approve setting aside
the law.
"You state that these are cheap
places of amusement patronized by the
working classes, but this is no argu
ment why they should not be made as
safe and as comfortable as any thea
ter* in this city. The children of all
classes of our citizens flock to the
cheaper theaters, and it was with the
object of protecting the lives of the lit
tle ones that the ordinances regulating
the construction of theaters have been
adopted.
"It is to the advantage of the build>
ing trades that laws passed for sound
and safe construction of edifices be
lived up to. It is to the advantage of
those who work in and about theaters,
as well as for the thousands who pat
ronize them, that every precaution be
taken to make them secure from the
danger of fire and panic. These cheap
theaters are among the best paying in
the city. They can afford to comply
wita the law. We wish to see the chil
dren and the grown persons of our
community provided with the best of
amusements and at prices within the
reach of all. but our main consideration
is the safety and security of life and
limb and the upholding of the law.
Very respectfully.
T. P. ANDREWS,
"Foreman Grand Jury."

TRIES TO KILL
A JOB BROKER
John Daly, Engineer, Shoots
at Employment Agent Who
Befuses to Beturn His Fee
Alleging that he had been deceived in
til* matter of retting; a Job, John Daly,
an engineer, attempted to murder R.
Ready of the firm of Murray & Ready,
employment agents, yesterday after
noon. One shot was fired, but the bul
let went wild owing to the fact that
Ready closed in on his assailant and
grappled with him. Before any further
damage could be done the engineer was
disarmed by several men who were in
the place and he was later arrested by
Policeman John Alpers. He was
charged at the Central police station
with .assault to commit murder.
Daly applied to Murray & Ready for
a position as engineer at a pumping
works near Oakley on February 3. He
paid a fee of $1 50 and the position was
procured for him. Yesterday the appli
cant returned to the employment
agency at 634 Clay street and demanded
that his fee be returned to him. He
explained to Ready that the Job was
not as it had been represented to him
and that he was dissatisfied with It.
Ready denied this and refused to re
fund the fee. A heated dispute fol
lowed, during which Daly drew a revol
ver and leveled it at the agent. Ready
was too quick and before Daly could
fire his arm was seized and thrown
downward. Daly polled the trigger
while the revolver was in this position
and the bullet entered a wall a few
inches above the floor.
The shot attracted the attention of
the throng of men who had gathered in
the main office waiting for jobs, and
whiie*most of them dashed for the door
and some climbed through a window on
Merchant street, several rushed to the
assistance of Ready. In a few mo
ments the furious man was disarmed
and turned over to the police. When

DEATH LURKS
IN THE WALL
Explosion of Gas Partially
Wrecks Giers Hall and Ser
iously Injures the Janitor
TEST CAUSES ACCIDENT
Carl Goertz Lights Match
to Try Joint in Pipe, Ig
niting the Deadly Fluid
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 4.
A heavy explosion of gas which, es
caping from a peaking pipe, had col
lected between the walls of the build
ing this morning severely injured Carl
Goertz. a janitor, who lives at 791
Thirty-seventh street, and partially
wrecked Gler's Hall at 511 Fourteenth
street Goertz was hurled from a lad
der on which he was at work and was
badly burned about the face and neck.
A large area of laths and plaster was
torn from the wall and scattered
broadcast by the force of the explo
sion.
Early this' morning when the jani
tor opened the hall he noticed the
odor of escaping gas and after a
search discovered that a pipe in the
wall was leaking. Shutting off the
gas he repaired the leak and then,
not knowing that a large amount of
the gas had collected between the
brick flre wall and the plaster, he
struck a match to test the joint in
the pipe. An explosion followed and
Goertz was thrown from the ladder
and half burled under the falling
laths and plaster.
The Janitor narrowly escaped the
loss of his eyesight, his eyebrows and
eyelashes being burned away. Theo
Gier, the proprietor of the building,
has not yet estimated the damage.
AMERICANS NOW REFUSE
TO PAY EXCESSIVE REXT
System of Extorting: Great Snms for
Houses hi London at an
End.
LONDON, Feb. 4.â Owners of Lon
don mansions are beginning to realize
that Americans will no longer pay ex
orbitant prices for the luxury of pos
sessing a town residence for the sea
son. Last year, taking advantage of the
great influx of American visitors who
desired to have houses of their own
for two or three months, they demand
ed prices 160 per cent in advance of
the ordinary value of such residences,
with the result that many of the most
eligible piaces remained unlet. Taking
a lesson from these experiences owners
do not propose to Indulge in such ex
tortion this coming season.
"The appearance of Mrs. Qoelet and
her daughter on the scene last year,"
says one agent, "caused many of us to
think that there would be an extra
ordinary demand for West End houses.
It was also rumored that Lady Cur
zon's sisters were going to be married
to Kneiish noblemen, so the prospects
of a brilliant American season looked
hopeful. We found too lote that most
of the Americans had decided to do
their entertaining at the fashionable
hotels, while many of them cleared out
of London altogether and went to
Paris."
The report current in London a few
days ago that Mrs. Goelet had cabled
an offer for Devonshire House, the
tov.n residence of the Duke of Devon
shire, is not strictly accurate. An en
terprising house agent, knowing that
Mrs. Goelet was anxious to have a town
house for her daughter, cabled to the
lady that the Duke of Devonshire's
house in Piccadilly was to be sold. Al
though a reply is expected, it has not
yet arrived.

GOD OF LOVE
WINS ANOTHER
BIG VICTORY
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, Feb. 4.â Cupid is contin
ually playing: the old same of "here I
come, creeping, creeping," and society
Is ever In the attitude of the child at
Pla?. waiting, with a little thrill of
pleasant expectation, for the startling
"here I am!" The little god of love has
announced his presence here In Oak
land so often, however, that we cannot
make even a pretense of astonishment
any more. But most of us experienced
a real, old-fashioned start of surprise
when we heard that Harold Havens
had captured the heart and hand of the
very stunning girl who has been visit
ing his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank C.
Havens. The young lady in question is
Miss Hope Cheney,* the talented daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. John Vance Cheney,
who are probably better known in San
Francsico, their former t home, than in
New York, .where they now reside. Mlsb
Cheney spent the summer with the
Havenses at Sag Harbor, N. V., and
coming with them to California was
their guest until recently.
Harold Havens has been considered
quite a "catch" by Oakland matrons
with marriageable daughters, and he
has been reported engaged at various
times to nearly every girl in his sooial
set. It la said that the wedding will
take place at an early date, and Mr.
Havens and his bride will certainly
make a very handsome couple, as Miss
Cheney is a girl of striking appearance
and "Bud" Havens, as his intimates
call him, always attracts attention
with his athletic shoulders and leonine
head.
"Here I come, creeping, creeping,"
again, with another announcement of
more than ordinary interest. Miss Es
ther Macdonald, daughter of former
Councilman J. A. C. Macdonald, is en
gaged to J. Fred Seulberger, the well
known young florist and popular Elk.
Both young people have grown up here
In Oakland, and the announcement of
their engagement will surprise scores of
friends, for they have kept their little

ly appointed Horticultural Commission
er for Alatneda County, and he is also
prominent in Masonic circles. He Is the
son of Julius Seulberger and is asso
ciated in business with his father. It is
Interesting to know that he was born
in Irvington-on-the-Hudson, opposite
the house in which Washington Irving
lived. During the war with Spain Mr.
Seulberger was in the commissary de
partment of the United States trans
port Warren. The wedding will take
place in June and will probably be sol

musical and is a graduate of the Oak

A lot of enthusiastic music lovers In
Berkeley have banded together under
the name of the Home Music Club for
the purpose of Inculcating In the aver
age soul an appreciation of good music.
As real appreciation can only follow
what one" truly understands, they pro
pose by a series of unique recitals to
help the musically uneducated, as well
as the educated, to acquire knowledge.
For this purpose they plan to secure
well-known artists on various instru
ments for the different concerts, and
before the musical programme begins
an explanatory talk will be given, tell
ing of the origin and evolution of what
ever instrument is to be played upon
and its particular place and use in or
chestra arrangements.
The club met at the residence of Mrs.
Stephen J. Sill In Berkeley last Monday
evening. Talks on the subject near to
heart were made by W. J. McCoy, Pro
fessor Christy, Mrs. Darst, Mrs. Sill
and Mrs. Sweezy. Among the enthu
siasts, besides those already men
tioned, who are working for the success
of this commendable enterprise, are
Mrs. W. R. Pond, Mrs. Hartley and
Miss "Victorine Hartley.
The fortnigthly meetings of the Linda
Vista Club are always pleasantly an
ticipated events up on Vernon Heights
and are frequently brilliant affairs as
well. Last night it was Mr. and Mrs.
E. M. Walsh's turn to entertain, and
they did so in their usual royally hos
pitable fashion. The club members
first enjoyed an elaborate dinner, the
entire party being seated at a great
round table, which was charmingly
adorned with -pink carnations. Then
the usual games were played, the prizes
goinp to Mrs. Eby. Mr. Walsh, Mr.
Belcher and Mr. Hubbard.
Mrs. Dow, who is quite 111, was unable
to be present, and the J. A. Brittons,
who live in San Francisco now, were
also absent. ' The members are: Mr.
and Mrs. W. A. Houts, Mr. and Mrs.
John D. Eby, Mr. and Mrs. E. J. Cot

The appearance of Miss Eleanor Ha
ber, the popular society entertainer and
monologist, in Ebell Hall on Monday
evening is awaited with considerable
interest. She is said to be not only at
tractive in appearance, but unusually
clever in her chosen work. She comes
to us highly praised, and as a large
number cf prominent women, includ
ing Mrs. Requa, Mrs. George H. Whea
ton, Miss Ethel Moore, Mrs. Henry
Butters, Mrs. H.C. Taft and others,
are acting as patronesses, her recital
Monday evening will probably be quite
a society function.

BOY'S DEATH
STILL UNSOLVED
Post-Mortem Examination of
Remains of Young Lubben
Finds- No Signs of Bruises
HAZING IS NOT PROVED
Father Eeiterates Story of
Violence and an Inquest
Will Be Held by Coroner
ALAMEDA, Feb. 4.â Cerebro menin
gitis was the cause of the death of 9
year-old Clarence Lubben, the alleged
victim of boy hazers at the Longfellow
School, according to Dr. C. George Bull,
who performed a post-mortem exam
ination on the remains of the lad to
day. Whether the disease which ended
the child's life was caused by the rough
handling he is said to have been sub
jected to by schoolmates the autopsy
physician was unable to determine. No
trace of bruises remained upon the
boy's body. If any were inflicted. An
inquest will be held Monday evening at
the undertaking parlors of Smiley &
Gallagher. Coroner H. B. Mehrmann
has ordered Deputy Coroners H. C. Gal
lagher and A. P, Smiley to subpena all
persons with any knowledge of the al
leged hazing and of the condition 6t
Clarence 'Lubben before and after the
"bouncing" is said to have been done.
To-morrow afternoon the funeral of the
child will be held from the home of his
father. John Lubben, 630 Railroad ave
nue. The remains will be incinerated
at the Oakland crematory.
In making the post-mortem examina
tion Dr. Bull was assisted by Dr. M. W.
Brown and Dr. L. W. Stidham. Regard
ing the autopsy Dr. Bull said:
"I found no evidence of bruises or of
injuries to the brain, lungs or abdom
inal organs, such as might be caused
by the treatment the boy is alleged to
have received. Injuries of that nature,
however, may have been inflicted three
weeks ago and become obliterated
through healing. I have taken a deep
interest !n the case. Public sentiment
has been so wrought up over the pub
lished reports of the illness and death
of the boy that an Inquest is impera
tive. Clarence was not a rugged child.
His mother died from tuberculosis. The
shock he is said to have sustained in
the alleged hazing may have brought
on the illness that resulted in his death.
I will make a microscopec examination
of sections of the brain, lungs and ab
dominal organs to satisfy myself if
they contained any tubercular germs."
John Lubben, the father of the dead
lad, will not believe that any cause
other than the hazing he asserts his
boy received was indirectly responsible
for his child's death. He said:
"I am morally certain, although I
cannot prove It at this late date, that
the Injuries my son received by being
hazed at the Longfellow Grammar
School brought about his death. He
came home on the day he was first
tossed into the air and was bleeding
from the mouth and vomiting. There
was also a bruise on his right side that
might have been caused by a fall or a
kick. He was never the same after that
day. While the doctors found no signs
of bruises on the body, sufficient time
had elapsed for the bruises to have dis
appeared. He told me that he had been
thrown into the air and hurt, and I be
lieved that what he said was the truth.
I will insist that a thorough inquisition
into the entire affair be made by the
Coroner, and will assist the authorities
in every way to place the blame where
it belongs."
School Superintendent Fred T. Moore
is preparing a report of the investiga
tion he made in the Lubben case, to be
submitted to the Board of Education
next Tuesday night. President Frank
Otis of the Board of Education has also
interested himself in reported hazings
and will be ready Tuesday night to dis
cuss the. matter.
London's Hotel for Babies.
Now that the Countess Poulett has
given her patronage to the children's
hotel in London many of England's
fashionable babies will become the
proud tenants of select suites in this
new and extraordinary Institution.
The new London hotel is under the con
trol of the Nordland Institute of Nurses
and Is furnished throughout to suit
the peculiar needs of its fastidious lit
tlii inmates, whose parents, finding It
necessary to run down to shooting pre
serves or across to the continent, pre
fer a select place of this kind to the
d( Ã¼btful care of their home servants.
Each baby or child has its own student
nurse in its own suite and the prices
run from $12 a week upward. No chil
dren over 8 years of age are accepted,
but babies in the feeding bottle stage
may become honored guests and have
suites as high as $100 a week. The
furniture suits the age of the guest. â

Railroading in East Africa.
A collision recently occurred on the
Uganda Railroad, British East Africa,
that would be possible nowhere else on
earth. A huge bull rhinoceros rushed
out of the bush and charged at full
speed the so-called "up mixed" train,
which was slowing down as it ap
proached the station Sultan Hamond,
218 miles from Mombasa. The train
was stopped and the "rhino" was dis
covered about one hundred yards down
the track. Slowly he returned to the
jungle and was lost to sight. He did
r.ot escape unharmed, for pieces of his
thick skin were found adhering to the
train, but the fierceness of his assault
smashed the engine step and splintered
the inch and a half footboard of the
first carriage. â New York Tribune.

THREE LITTLE
MAIDS CHOSEN
Girls Who Are to Be the
Trio From the "Mikado"
Named by Stage Director
MISS COOPER TO SING
College Miss Will Play the
Part of Katisha in the
Stiles' Hall Production
BERKELEY. Feb. 4. â Envied by
their sisters of the Pryta^nean Society,
three pretty members of that organiza
tion now stand in the limelight at the
university because they have been
chosen to sing the three leading roles
in the production of the "Mikado." The
girls who are to trip across the boards
of the Macdonough Theater as the
three little maids from school are Miss
Marguerite Shoecraft, Miss Ethel Mere
dith and Miss Mary Ratcllff. Sharing
with them the principal honors of the
cast is Miss Claxa Cooper, who will ap
pear as Katishaâ she with the marvel
ously beautiful elbow.
The selection of these four girls for
the most important parts, with the
choice of Edwin Rust to play Koko and
Edward Stern to appear as Pooh Bah,
Professor Magee acting as the Mikado,
has made the cast of the operatic pro
duction complete.
The first complete rehearsal, with
principals and chorus working together,
is to be held next Monday afternoon
at 4 o'clock in Stiles Hail. Manager
Mervyn Samuels has set February 10
as the date when tickets are to be re
served by students at the co-operative
store on the campus.
Miss, Shoecraft, who is to be Yum
Turn, is a Berkeley girl, a graduate of
the local High School and a member
of the Alpha Phi sorority. Miss Rat
cliff is a Phi Beta Kappa and a Delta
Delta Delta girl, while Miss Meredith,
who is from San Diego, belongs to the
Chi Omega sorority. Miss Cooper la a
member of the PI Beta Phi.
C. B. Moore, a glee club man, will
have the role of Pish-tush.
A chorus of twenty co-eds, all mem
bers of the Prytanean Society, is now
being diligently trained by Clinton
Morse.
The Prytaneans are to render the
"Mikado" at the Macdonough Theater
on February 24 for the benefit of the
university hospital fund.
ELECTRIC SHOCKS
IN HIGH AI/rrrUDES
Visitors From the Sem Level Much
Disturbed by the Unusual
Experiences.
"It is dangerous for me to go to bed."
That announcement by a stylishly
dressed woman at the desk of the Al
bany Hotel office one night startled
William Maher, one of the proprietors,
who was standing at the counter.
"What is the trouble?" asked Mr.
Maher, as soon as he recovered his
voice:
"The room is filled with electricity,"
replied the woman. "If I walk across
the floor and touch my face with my
hand there is a snap, and if I touch the
iron bed I get a shock. Why, kind sir,
it's awful! Everything I touch snaps!
You might think I was some electrical
freak and belonged with some show.
But I am not. Honest, I never knew
before that my system was electrified."
"Where is your home?" asked Mr.
Maher.
"San Francisco," replied the woman.
"I thought you were from the sea
level," said Mr. Maher. "You have
nothing to fear. The room is not
charged with electricity. There is
nothing wrong with the telephone or
electric light wires. You see, madam,
that you are not acclimated In Denver.
The air here is extremely dry and is
therefore subcharged with electricity,
so that you in touching iron feel a
slight shock and also a slight shock
when you walk across the carpet and
then touch anything with your hand
or shake hands with anybody. You'll
get over it in a few days."
The woman went away mystified but
satisfied, and Mr. Maher said:
"That's a common complaint in every
hotel in town. Those of us who live
here will now and then feel an electric
shock by touching a conductor or when
walking over a carpet if we touch our
faces or shake hands, but we are not
as subjective to electrical influences
as those who come from sea level or
from places where the air is moist.
These people, of course, are shocked
easily, and as It is a new experience for
them they invariably believe that the
telephone or electric light wires are
crossed and that they are in danger of
electrocution.
"We had a woman 1n the hotel last
weelr who was startled because when
she began to comb the hair of her
French poodle electric currents ran up
her arms. She thought that somebody
had been playing a Joke on her dog,
and she was furious until I explained
to her the cause."â Denver Republican.
Venerable and Valuable Grapevine.
The famous old grapevine at Hamp
ton Court Palace, planted in 1768 from
a slip off a vine in Essex, is still vig
orous and still produces excellent
grapes. The principal branch of the
vine is 114 feet in length, and its max
imum girth is 45 inches. The vine was
at its greatest productive power some
forty years ago. when it yielded be
tween 2300 and 2500 bunches, weighing
one pound each on the average. Last
year, in consequence c-f thinning out
its branches, it bore only 700 clusters,
but these were of superior size and
quality. Recently the vinery has been
enlarged and practically rebuilt, and by
removing the paving stones of the old
vine house it is thought the vine will
receive new vigor. Visitors, to whom
the great vine has always been one of
the attractions of Hampton Court, will
hereafter be excluded from the vinery
and will be compelled to admire the
mammoth royal vine from the exterior
of the vinery, which ! built of glass. â

MAKES A NOVEL CLAM
In Face of Strong Evidence
Prisoner Declares His In
nocence and Feigns Illness
SDcci&l DUpateh to Til* CmlL
NEW YORK. Feb. 4.â Posltfv* iden
tification has been made of George H.
Wood as the man who drove away with
George Williams from latter's grocery
store in Watchung, N. J., on Thursday,
two hours before the grocery mar. s
body wag found In a sleigh four mile*
north of Watchung. Wood is In thÂ«
tombs awaiting extradition to New Jer
sey. He Is charged with being thÂ« mur
derer of Williams.
Wood would have the police authori
ties believe that because of some men
tal disorder he has no recollection of
being In Plainfleld. Watchung or War
renville, and that while suffering from
a peculiar affliction he wandered around
the neighborhood of his early youth
unconscious of his doings or his sur
roundings. I* the face of identifica
tions that leave no room for doubt that
Wood was the person who hired the
grocery man to drive him from
Watchung to Warrenvlile on Thursday,
the prisoner professes to have no
knowledge of being in Plainfleld. wherÂ»
hÂ« registered plainly and distinctly on
the Farmers' Hotel register and -where
in the room assigned to him. Chief
Kiely of the Plainfleld police found
Wood's suit case.
With every circumstance pointing to
the guilt of Wood as the slayer of Wil
liams, there Is still no motive that can
be assigned for the shooting and kill
ing' of the Watchung grocery man.
TTTE JAPANESE SOLDIERS
AND THE AMERICAN MTXE
Wby the Unwonted ( ombination" Does
Not Work Well on the
March or Field.
"So the Japanese rice growers are
not willing to tackle that Interesting
native institution, the American mule,
without the aid of home folk," said
an observant man, "and I can see
where they are right about the mat
ter. The American mule ts a lor.sr
â¢eared, quick-heeled, supple-J'inted
mystery, and no man, no matter how
wise he may be, can do anything with
him unless he have special training.
As a matter of fact, the white man in
America is sadly deficient when it
comes to a working knowledge of thÂ©
mule. Up to the present writing the
American negro is the only living per
son who can claim anything like mas
tery when it comes to the mule. Some
how there is something in the nature
of the black man and the mule which
makes it easier for them to get along.
Just what it is I do not know. But
even the black man will have his ups
and downs now and then with thÂ«
mule, antJ I have seen some very in
teresting instances of this kind, one
of the most amusing being that of an
extremely hard skulled negro, who
never wanted a better weapon than
his head in. any gort of conflict with
man or beast.
"One day he fell odfr with his mule.
Ordinarily they grot along well enough
together. But In some way the mule
on the day in question made the ne
gro mad and the fight began. In the
first place the negro broke his water
Jug over the mule's head. This did
not feaze the animal. Grabbing the
mule by the ears and taking a good,
firm grip, the black man landed with
vigor between the mule's ears, using
his head as a weapon. The blow was
a knockout blow all right, but the
trouble was It knocked the negro out
also. Both mule and negro fell to the
ground as if dead. In a short while
both were up again and after that
they were fairly good friends. The
Japs are right. They will need spe
cial training on the mule proposition
and no mistake, and the negro is
about the best man they can get to
do the training." New Orleans

Hissing in the Theater.
New York audiences still decline to
hiss, which fact may account for thÂ«
rottenness of most of our dramaa.
Formerly there was no hissing in the
theater. The benevolent audience were
content to yawn and fall asleep. Tha
invention of hissing is no older than
1680, and took place at the first repre
sentation of "Aspar," a tragedy of Fon
tenelle. So we are told by the poet
Roi in his "Brevet de la Calotte." A
farce was produced in Bannister's time
under the title of "Fire and Water. "
"I predict its fate," said he. "What
fate?" whispered the anxious aiithor
at his side. "What fate?" said Ban
nister; "why, what can fire and water
produce but a hiss?"â New York Press.
Delusion of Noted Man.

one of his legs belonged to a Roman
Catholic and, therefore, when he went
to bed every night he used to lea\
Catholic leg outside the blanket by way
of punishment.â New York Tribune.

According to the most authoritative
estimates, there are now about 700,000
Jews in New York, the total population
,f which in 1903, as estimated by the
Census Bureau, was 3,716,139. Perhaps
the Jews may be about one-flfth of the
present population.

ALIENS' PITIFUL PLIGHT
Fear Murder or Army
Conscription When They
Return to the Fatherland
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â The fall of
Port Arthur and the likelihood of ex
tensive military conscription in Russia
have served to drive a horde of Rus
sian Hebrews to the United States. Re
ports received by Commissioner Gen
eral Sargent from New York show un- |
precedented immigration Irom Russia !
for the month of December and Janu- i
ary. The new arrivals are of a most
undesirable class and are being turned
back by hundreds.
Official reports for the month of
January have not been received, but
unofficial statements Indicate that the
total number of immigrants debarred
at New York during that month waa
several times greater than in any other
month in years. Nine-tenths of the
persons to be refused admission were
Russian Jews. They told pitiful stories
to the immigration authorities and
pleaded not to be sent back to Russia.
They all make practically the same
statement, which is that if they are
compelled to return to Russia they will
be murdered. They say they will be
either conscripted and sent to the front
or mistreated and starved to death in
the big cities. Some distressing stories
are contained in the numerous appeals
that are being made to Secretary Met
calf in behalf of the unfortunate for
eigners.
For the most part the aliens* are
practically destitute. The total earth
ly possessions of the men and the wo
men range from 25 cents to a few dol
lars each. They invariably are in poor
health on arrival, due to the long and
trying sea voyage. Some of them are
fit subjects for hospitals on reaching
New York. In view of the lack of
money and the poor prospects for ob
taining employment, the authorities
feel compelled to order the deportation
of moat of the Jews on the ground that
they wiil become public charges.
The Washington officials have direct
ed the New York immigration officers
to adhere strictly to the letter of the
law and not permit their sympathies to
be worked upon to the detriment of the
public interest.
The Hebrew Society of New York Is
doing everything it can to aid the un
fortunate foreigners. It has provided
attorneys to see that Hebrews are ac
corded fair treatment and that their ap
peals to the department are drawn in
proper shape. But the administration
authorities believe there Is a national
menace in the tremendous Influx of
Russians, and while In many cases It
seems absolute cruelty to send them
back, there Is no other course that can
be followed.

PRIVATEOUTRANKSTHE
NON=COMS IN LOVE
VANQUISHES THEfI IN RIVALRY
ROMANCE OF DANCE HALL
CLIMAXES IN COURT.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
By hisÂ« superior charm oi person
ality Private Morris Monroe was al
leged to have distanced both Ser
jeant C. W. Beshopp and Corporal
Edward England in the handicap con
test for Miss Ruby Montague's tran
sient preference, thereby augmenting
the reputation for wisdom acquired by
the Scottish bard who wrote:
For rank is but the guinea stamp â
The man's the man for a" that.
Witnesses of the final struggle tes
tified before Police Judge Fritz that
it was strenuous and decisive. With
the perversity that cynicism pro
nounces inseparable from her sex, |
Miss Montague switched her allegi
ance from the corporal to the ser
geant and then abruptly transferred
it to the private, where it adhered
with a tenacity that neither the single
nor united effort of the jilted non-coms
could relax. Arm in arm with her
latest choice she paraded the waxed
floor until the temper of the ousted
duo succumbed to the strain, and they
attempted to accomplish by violent
means what blandishment had failed
to effect. Casting themselves simul
taneously upon the private they tried
to break him away from Miss Monta
gue's clutch, and then the battle was
on. The private proved himself as
formidable In combat as in love, for
when the police entered the arena
they found his superior officers pros
trate, while he and the more-than
ever-infatuated Miss Montague strut
ted in triumph. It was despite the
protest of all neutral onlookers that
he was placed under arrest with his
vanquished rivals, for the poetry of
the situation clearly opposed such a
climax. To the victor belonged the
spoils of war, and no portion of its
penalty was logically pleaded In the
private's behalf, but with charac
teristic lack of either sentiment or
practical discrimination the police
tore him from Miss Montague's em
brace and booked the soldiers three
for peace disturbance.
Prior to the calling of the case it
was whispered in the court corridors
that Miss Montague's sudden surren
der to the private was actuated less
by admiration for him than by resent
ment of caustic comment flung by a
sister danseuse. This lady was re
ported to have said when she saw the
corporal abandoned for the sergeant,
"The sergeant is Johnnie on the spot
until a soldier of higher rank comes
in, and then he'll be where the cor
poral is." This remark, rumor had it,
was either overheard by or trans
mitted to Miss Montague, and to con
found its author she descended from
the sergeant to the private at one
swoop.
Judge Fritz emulated the police
men's failure to reward valor and
fined each of the defendants $10.
Mrs. Hugh Krens, whose husband
was arrested for beating her, told
Judge Mogan that she was a sales
woman at the Emporium when she
became a bride last October and that
since then she has supported her hus
band in idleness by leading an im
moral life, he having forced her to
do so. She had tried to get away
from his Influence, but he threatened
to kill her If she left him, and he was
brandishing a knife when she
screamed for help last Friday night
in her apartment at 311 Grant avenue.
Judge Mogan held the defendant in
$1000 bail and suggested that he be
formally charged with having com
pelled his wife to lead a life of shame.
The amended complaint will be heard
to-morrow.
Patrick O'Brien said he did not desire
to prosecute Thomas E. Stack, by
whom he was stabbed about a dozen
times at Fourth and Folsom streets
several weeks ago. It was in resent
ment of an Insult addressed to his wife
by O'Brien that Stack piled his knife.
Judge Mogan dismissed the charge of
assault with a deadly weapon.
Confessing Inability to probe to the
bottom the caae in which Giovanni
Dondado was accused of pursuing D.
Martini with a hatchet and apparent
murderous intent, Judge Cabaniss dis
missed the complaint. There'were half
a dozen Italian witnesses and each of
them told an almost entirely different
â tory of the chase and what led to It.
Prefatory to his sentencing of J. "W.
Alley, vagrant, to thrte months' Im
prisonment, Judge Fritz said:
"The present Legislature would do a
commendable thing by passing up to
the Governor a bill making It a felony
for a man to accept maintenance from
a fallen woman. Such a law would en- j
able us to rid this community of a very
I undesirable element."
Allen was convicted on the lnad- '.
vertent statement of a courtesan that
his only means of subsistence was her
j earnings. It was the first time that
j such, an admission was ever made in
Judge Fritz's court, and the woman
seemed to regret that she had made it.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Eight thickly-veiled women stood be
fore Judge Mogan and heard them
j selves formally accused of having vis-
I ited a place where pools are sold, said
' place being a reas. room in the station
ery store of Alexander and Grace
Schwartz at 217 Polk street. Three oth
er defendants on the same charge failed
to appear.
Patrolmen Kracke and Mitchell testi
fied that they were In plain clothes and
intrusted with the task of raiding pool
rooms when they entered the Schwartz ;
establishment at 2 o'clock Friday after
noon and In the rear room found the
eleven defendants, all of whom were
unquestionably there for the purpose of ;
betting on the Burns handicap at j
I Emeryville, for they were eagerly dis
1 cussing that stellar speed event and
had in their possession "dope sheets"
relating to the same. They were bun- :
! died Into a patrol wagon and hauled to
I the Southern police station, where they
I registered as Ada Marks, Katherine
j June, EHen Kane, Margaret Hobbs,
Eliza Harrington, Carrie Brown, Rose
Clarke, Emma Dickson, Florence Mc-
Donald, Mary Ferguson and Lucy
Gray. Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz were
also arrested and charged with keeping
a poolroom.
Just how many of the women were
booked under assumed names could not
be ascertained, but Clerk "Pat" Gray
offe/ed to wager odds that there was .
not a genuine title on the list, his as- j
sumption being based upon the plain
â  ness of the baptismal half of the cogno-
I mens. "Not a Gladys or a Violet or a
'Pearl In the bunch," he said. That one
woman at least had endeavored to
cloak her Identity was proved when the
Judge recognized Emma Taylor, who '
was recently before him on the charge
of shoplifting and is now on parole. It
was apparent, however, that the major
ity of the group were not of the class
designated "sporting," but were wives
of worklngmen. Indeed, one young lady
admitted that she was led to the hy
meneal altar two months ago. Each of
them had plausible reason other than
that of gambling for being in the sta
tionery store, the excuses being record
ed as follows:
Ada Marksâ Dropped in to straighten
her hat at the Schwartz mirror, the
headgear having suddenly become
awry as she was passing the store.
Ellen Kaneâ Watch had stopped and
went to adjust it by the Schwarta
clockâ a timepiece of notable reliabil
ity.
Margaret Hobbsâ Postage stamps.
Eliza Harrington â Consulting Mrs.
Schwartz on the subject of a dress pat
tern.
Carrie Brownâ Back number of La
dies' Home Journal.
Rose Clarkeâ Perfumed stationery.
Emma Dlcksonâ Ditto.
Mary Fergusonâ To tie her shoe-
Btring.
Katherine June, Florence McDon
ald and Lucy Gray did not appear in
court, and if they fail to materialize
there with the ether defendants at 11:30
o'clock to-morrow morning their bail of
120 apiece will be forfeited. His Honor
Intimated that at the next Inning all
the defendants must appear unveiledâ
an intimation which caused quite a
flutter among the eight who heard it
The police then hinted that they may
accuse Mrs. Schwartz of keeping a
pooling place and charge her husband
simply with visiting it, they having re
ceived additional evidence to the ef
fect that the gambling end of the busi
ness was conducted solely by the
wife.
Michael O'Keefe, who stabbel Police
Captain Duke, was paroled for two
weeks by Judge Mogan.
When Ed Rooney met Carl Carls
mark and said "Hands up." or what
bounded like it. he was promptly knock
ed down by that gentleman, and both
were arrested for the fight that en
sued. Mr. Rooney explained to Judge
Fritz that when he accosted Mr. Carls
mark his intention was not to rob, and
that his seemingly felonious exclama
tion was in reality a cordial greeting,
ht having mistaken Mr. Carlsmark for
a friend of his named Hans Suppe.
whom he had not seen for several
years. The Judge looked long and
searchinsly at Mr. Rooney, who un
falteringly withstood the ordeal, ere
he discharged him and imposed a $10
fine on Mr. Carlsmark.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Usefnl It Is in
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize Its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
Uig purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impuritiea always present in
the stomach and intestinelÃ and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form, or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blcod, and the beauty of it Is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but, on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and, although in some
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal In
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
any of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

the $10,000 stake, only to meet failure.

THE JK CALL
have belonged to Claude. Hal Ander
son, who piloted W, R. Condon, is a
marvelously strong finisher, and he
outrode the lighter boy when the cru- ,
cial moment arrived. Back from some
where in the clouds, it almost seemed,
Veterano came en and finished third.
HOXITOX THE OXI.Y ABSENTEE.
Patiently the vast throng waited for
the stellar event, which came fourth on
the card. Honiton was the only ab
sentee, leaving the unlucky number
thirteen to face the webbing. Each
starter received a careful scanning fur
any defect or flaw, as the exercise boys
put them through their warming up
â se. Then followed the rush to the
bookmakers' realm, where twenty-Fix
layers sto-od ready to argue it out with
the talent. Two to 1 appeared to be the
market price about the Daly pair. Gar-
B< t Ferguson's Military Man. the
mount of Davis, had a vast following
and at 5 to 1 thousands were wagrered
on the chestnut horse. Pasadena, the
three-year-old from Los Angeles, was
higrhly touted, and a carload of cojn
sent up from the southland kept the
colt's price at S l^ and 6. Walter Jen
nings said he had no excuses to make
for Rockaway or "Big Bill" Knapp and
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1905.
the ring was forced to rub a point or
two from the opening leader of 10.
Horatius and Bombardier, the Skinner
stable, both looked in well and did not
lack backing at 6 and 8 to 1.
BOOKIES RUB A POINT.
Ten at ono stage was hung out
against the P'zell duo, W. R. Condon
and Flying Torpedo, but a drizzling
play made the bookies rub a point.
Veterano, Gateway and Barrack were
nibbled at by the leng-range players.
Shortly before 4:13 o'clock the bugle
called the horses out. Once at the bar
rier W. R. Condon evinced a dislike for
every other horse in sight, and showed
superior judgment by endeavoring to
kick both Claude and Military Man out
of commission. This aroused the anger
of Claude, and he landed hard on the j
right shoulder of Military Man with j
one of his plate?, cutting a slight gash j
and apparently inflicting injury. After |
just a four-minute stay Dick Dwyer, j
catching every starter aligned and in .
motion, released the barrier to a mag
nificent start. Knapp, on the outside
with Rockaway, was first to show clear
of the bunch. Passing the stand the
first time Pasadena, Military Man and
Gateway were close at the heels of the
Jennings horse. On the back stretch
Fuller could be peen at work on Pasa
dena, the three-year-old even then be
ing hopelessly beaten.
ROCKAWAY WEAKENS.
Rockaway maintained his advantage
until the far almost, when he sud
denly weakened, and it could then be
prophesied that Claude and W. R. Con
don would fight It out. These two horses
turned Into the straight for home al
most on even terms, Condon on the
outside, Willie Daly astride Claude
hugging the rail. About an eighth of a
mile from the goal Daly, under instruc
tions, left the inside position, joining
Anderson and W. R. Condon "on the
ridge." Then the real duel began. At
the paddock Claude had a head ad
vantage, and a great cheer went up
from the crowd. It was premature,
however. Anderson, riding like a de
mon, caused his mount to swerve in,
bumping Claude slightly. It was get
ting too close, and Daly drew his whip.
Perhaps this cost Claude the race, for
a light boy cannot use the whip and
keep his horse straight too, especially
on a muddy track.
W. R. CONDOX Uf FRONT.
Forty yards from the wire W. R.
Condon had forged to the front, and
when he passed the wire first by half a
length a riotous demonstration, half
started, gave way to a hushed still
ness, almost painful. The public idol
had fallen. Then came the reaction
and the victorious horse and rider re
ceived the ovation tendered all win
ners. Veterano finished a fast coming
third, while old Barrack ran a close
fourth. Davis must have imagined
Military Man had lost a leg, for he
pulled him up early in the race.
The winner, a son of Troubadour and
Felipa, earned $7000 for Louis Ezell.
Claude's share amounted to $2000 and
$1000 went to the owners of Veterano.
The time for the mile and a quarter,
2:17%, marks the slowest run race in
the history of the stake.
Harry Stover's Abe Meyer captured
the Introductory two-year-old scram
ble. The winner was coupled in the
betting with Cazazza and, ridden hard
by Hoffman at the end, beat Achelita
half a length. Syphon Girl ran a good
third.
A moderate sized field started for the
seven-furlong selling purse, with tiol
Llchtenstein closing a slight favorite
over Cloche d'Or. Tommy mark, who
rode the latter mare, pulled up for
some reason at the start, ruining the
chances of his mount.
CIXCINXATUS AS PACEMAKER.
Cincinnati^, a 10 to 1 shot, made all !
the running, only to be downed less :
than a length at the wire by the first :
choice, astride which Davis rode a vig- !
orous race. The show went to War j
Times.
Elusive Mr. Farnum from Charley j
McCafferty's barn, took the mile sell- |
ing fixture. The gelding's price was ;
hammered down from 10 to 4M>, and ;
Bonner landed him an easy first. Isa- i
bellita, the mildly ridden favorite, was i
hard pressed to snatch the place from j
Barney Dreyfus. Follow Me quit after J
displaying some early speed out in the
lead.
Some ripe, mellow, importations were
played to lower the colors of Misty's
Pride in the five-furlong purse number,
but they failed to accomplish the trick.
The Oregon mare, with "Big Bill"
Knapp in the saddle, went to the post
favorite, with the Los Angeles delega
tion setting it in on Jimmy McLaugh
lln's Blue Coat. Tim Kurst, another
stranger from the BlutÃ stable, had a
stanch following. At the start Misty's
Pride skinned away in front and was
never headed. Prince Brutus quit, per
mitting Tim Hurst and Blue Coat to
fight it out for the place, the former
I earning a nose decision.
There was nothing to the last event,
a mile run for three-year-olds, but Ara.
The Stevens stable colt enjoyed the
honors of favoritism and with Jakie
Jones in the saddle won nil the way.
i GtaLotn Idol finished strong, downing
' Affrert Fir for the place.
TRACK NOTES.
Mike Daly took the defeat of Claude
philosophically. Mike has been on
the turf a long time and is accustomed
to those thinss.
The train from Los Angeles was be
hind time and Jockeys Fuller and
! Otis did not reach the track until
I nearly 2 o'clock.
Twenty-six bookmakers cut- in.
"English Bill" Jackman resumed op
erations after a brief rest on the
ground.
Previous to the big race President
Williams had a little side talk with
the jockeys that plainly had its ef
fect. He explained to them, among
other things, that three stablea were
starting and that if one horse com
mitted a foul the stable could be dis
qualified. There probably never was
a race decided over such a heavy
track where so slight bumping and
Jpitling were noticeable.
BURNS HANDICAP WINNER. HIS
' ' ' r 5 OWNER - AND 'A ' GLJMPSE OF >.
THE RACE. : \
Tom Hurlick, the bookmaker, vis- i
ited the track for the first time in j
four years.
Louis Ezell took W. R. Condon j
from a selling race at Kansas City for I
$1600. The bay horse was then ;
owned jUy Steubenboard & Co., now j
racing at Los Angeles, and it was done
in retaliation for the claiming of Elie
by the latter firm.
Claude was also claimed from a
selling race 'by "Father Bill" Daly,
brother of the bay horse's present
owner.
Lee Rose, the well known Southern j
California horseman, came up to see |
the handicap run. Lee, like the bal
ance of the Los Angales delegation, i
strung his coin on the chances of :
Pasadena.
Tommy Clark, who rode Cloche
dOr, was suspended by the judges
for pulling the mare up at the start.
There appeared to be no apparent
reason for doing so and her chances j
of winning were ruined.

Thousands Gather at Track
and Cheer the
Horses.
Down the stretch thirteen great
horses thundered, each straining every
muscle to be the first undfr the wire.
Ten thousand anxitus human beings,
their eyes glittering and their nerves
all a- tingle watched, hoped and waited.^
The clatter of hoofs grew more audible,
a murmur arose from the throats of
the multitude and then all was over.
The great Burns Handicap wad but a
memory and another great horse had
curried the colors v* his owner in tri
umph past the wire in the richest event
of the California turf.
The victory of W. R. Condon meant
juy and happiness for some, remorse
and regret for others. There were those
who laughed with glee as they held up
a winning ticket and there were oth
ers who gazed sorrowfully out upon
the muddy track and slowly wended
their way in search of sympathy. tear-
Ing up a bit of worthless pasteboard
as they went. It was a study in human
nature to look into the faces of the
multitude and read the expressions
stamped thereon.
All classes of men and women were
represented in the assemblage which
gathered to witness the struggle for
California's classic turf event. Such a
gathering is never seen outside of a
race course. Some were prompted by
curiosity, others answered the call of
their ruling passion and still others
were there for the purpose of witness
j ing the great trial for the pure love of
i the suort.
ENTHUSIASM IS RIFE.
There may have been larger crowds
at the Oakland track, but never has
a more enthusiastic nor a more inter
ested mass of humanity passed through
! the gates. The running of the Burns
Handicap seems to affect the people of
California to a marked degree and
arouses more feeling and enthusiasm
lihanI ihan all the other great turf events
j decided ye3r in and year out in the
Golden State.
The day was far from being an ideal
one, yet the crowd seemed to think
but little of the weather. Dark, threat
ening clouds were visible and a heavy
downpour seemed imminent. The
showers held aloof and the clouds grad
ually Began to dissolve, till a few rays
of welcome sunshine glistened forth
and appeared long enough to assure the
spectators their pleasure would not be
disturbed by a storm.,
The race course seemed to have taken
on a gala appearance in honor of the
great event. The lawns were never
greener, the clubhouse never looked
more Inviting, nor, in fact, did the gen
eral surroundings ever present a more
spick and span appearance. The crowd
began to assemble early, and long be
fore i the time rolled round for the first
race the grand stand was filled to ov*r
flowing, while the betting ring was a
veritable seething mass of humanity. :
BETTING RING IS THROXGKD.
Half an hour before the bis race of
the day was at hand the betting ring
presented a sight worth going miles to
see, although it was almost worth one's
life to pass through it. Men elbowed
one another for a chance to deposit
their coin with the bookmakers.
Up in the grand stand the scene was
equally remarkable, though that hustle
and bustle, the ruling factor of the wag
ering place, was lacking. Here hand
somely gowned women and their well
groomed escorts gazed about them,
nodding to acquaintances and discuss
ing the race and studying out the day's
programme.
Pool boys dashed hither and thither
at the beck and call of some fair
plunger. Everyone seemed excited, and
as the races of lesser importance were
decided. one by one the tension In
creased' until the occupants of the
grand stand were ready to shout them
selves hoarse when the bugle sound
called the handicap horses to the post.
When the candidates paraded past
the. stand the hum. of thousands of
voices gave way to their cheers. "Women
bent forward and clapped their hands
feverishly when they caught sight of
their favorite horse or jockey in the
procession. Men yelled and applauded
and felt satisfied as they beheld their
choice step proudly before the ever
critical throng that watched every
movement' of the horses.
CLAUDE IS CHEERED.
When Claude appeared it was the
signal for a general outburst of en
thusiasm, which was a i touching
tribute to the place he decuples in
the hearts of racegoers. The winner
of many turf battles was plainly the
public idol. Every one seemed glad
of a chance to applaud the bay horse,
and as he cantered proudly along with
head high and neck arched he seemed
to show his appreciation.
As the horses drew near the start
ins post every one in the grand stand
rose. The bettors forsook the ring and
crowded near the rail. A few minutes
of breathless suspense was spent while
Starter Dick Dwyer was getting the
field lined up. The storm broke when
the thirteen candidates sprang for
ward. It never abated till W. R. Con
don > tore . madly â¢to the wire, with
Claude, Veterano and Barrack in his
wake.
SOS'S DEATH
RECONCILES
THE CHOKERS
Wife's Mansion Now
Home of Former
Politician.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
' NEW YORK. Feb. 4. â The death
of ? Frank Cro.ker has brought about
a -reconciliation ;. between Richard
Croker and his wife. . .
Mr. and Mrs.,Croker had practically
separated long before Croker took up
his residence abroad, although they
continued to live in the same house at
i 5i 5 ' East Seventy-fourth ; street. r There
never â¢ has : been any . particularly bitter
feeling between the couple, r but their
interests ' lay along different; lines.
Frank Croker was the favorite son
of Â« his ' father . and was a 1 very : devoted
son to his : mother. '; His death was J a
terrible blow to her. There was much
conjecture when Croker, arrived as to
where â¢he " would stay while *in town.
He settled all this by i going to * Mrs.
Croker's home. He , has been there
ever since. It .was hi:< request that
nobody bother him while he was la
'New York, and "his . friends ; have â  left
him alone in his grief. - : He has been
constantly with his wife and family
during his stay: and only a few of . his
intimate i friends, like John Fox, presi
dent of 'â  the Democratic ;. Club, < have
seen him. \40

City Lots Accurately and Officially â  Surveyed.
CHARGES REASONABLE.
My field books, diagrams show, by actual
measurements, the exact points , from whloh
your t lot wu surveyed, which Is Imperatively
necessary,' as the City Surveyor and other sur-
veyors do not show that, and also because all
the original monuments were taken out when
the streets were formed In thÂ» â¦arty days ot
the city since which time the i different City
Surveyors extending to the present time haTei
made Innumerable errors In their street and
lot surveys, and to conceal such errors they
have moved ' the monument lines -* away from
their original "* correct positions without' legal
authority t from the people, causing blocks and
streets to measure Incorrectly, creating eaicees
measurements . In blocks of th* most valuable
portion of the city, which they do not distrib-
ute proportionately throughout the block, but
often give ' Â£_Â« . entire '. excess 'of sometimes 12
inches or more to- one. person, thereby Interfer-
ing with the deed distances of the people and -
thÂ« absolute, security of boundary lines.
Consult me before .. moving your â¢â¢ valuable

RAIN IN SOUTH
STOPS TRAFFIC
Railroad Companies Suffer
Heavy Damage as Floods
Have Swept Away Tracks
LANDSLIDES OCCUBRING
Eoadbed Between Beaumont
and El Casco Washed Out
for Distance of Two Miles
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 4. â Although
the rain had ceased in Los Angeles
this morning, reports from other
points in Southern California showed
a continued downpour and further
damage from the floods. All railroads
out of Los Angeles were tied up and
there were no trains on either of the
transcontinental lines in or out of the
city. Interurban traffrc was also
hampered, but all of the lines were
open.
The Los Angeles River, which last
night reached the highest stage it re
corded in several years, is subsiding.
There are reports of overflow and
some damage all along its course, tyit
nothing of a serious nature.
The damage to the streets of this
city, which were converted into tor
rential streams last night for several
hours by the floods from the adjoin
ing hills, will reach about $20,000.
The Santa Fe trains, both east and
west bound, are tied up. Serious wash
outs are reported on the Arizona divi
sion near Kingman, and it will proba
bly be twenty-four hours or longer
before traffic can be resumed. The
irark and roadbed was carried out in
short stretches in many places near
Kingrman and several bridges are
gone. Ail the large steel bridges,
however, are safe and it is expected
that temporary repairs sufficient to
permit the resumption of train sched
.ules will be made by Sunday.
The rain ceased in Los Angeles this
morning at 3:30. More than an inch
fell from 5 o'clock the previous even
ing, making: a total for the present
storm of 3.56 inches.
The residents of Terquisite Arroyo
and along the river bottom in River
side County have been driven to the
higher lands by the rising floods.
A, dispatch 'from San Bernardino
says that reports from Beaumont in
dicate great damage to Southern Pa
cific property between there and El
Casco, the roadbed being almost com
pletely washed out for a distance of
two miles, while for miles the tracks
are under debris washed down from
surrounding hills. Two bridges east
of El Casco have gone down and at
one point the water is two feet deep
and a qaurter of a mile wide on each
sid^ of the track. Officials at San
Bernardino report that traffic cannot
be resumed for three days at least.
The Southern Pacific is completely
cut off from Redlands by a heavy flood
sweeping down San Timoteo Canyon,
which has carried away part of Mount
View bridge and threatens Church
street bridge.
The Santa Fe is open between San
Bernardino and Barstow east, but
floods between there and Needles have
interfered with traffic.
The Santa Fe loop line through this
valley is open, though all trains are
running on slow orders, as landslides
are occurring constantly along the
route. Ranches east of this valley
suffered heavy damages from the floods
pouring down from San Timoteo Can
yon, many acres of fruit trees being
washed out.
It is reported from Ocean Park
that a heavy storm at sea there early
to-day caused considerable damage
along the water front. About a hun
dred feet of pleasure pier there was
demolished.
ARIZONA IS DELUGED.
Railroad Bridges Are Washed Away
and All Trains Delayed.
PHOENIX. Ariz., Feb. 4.â There were
no trains on the Santa Fe. Prescott and
Phoenix Railroad to or from Phoenix

TALKS ABOUT
SCOTCH AUTHOR
Aged Musician Tells of the
Night Sir Walter Scott Ad
mitted He Wrote Waverley
DESCRIBES THE WRITER
â â â¢ - - .''
Announcement Was Made at
Dinner in Edinburgh Near
ly Four Score Years Ago
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
LONDON, Feb. 4.â Some unusually
interesting reminiscences of Sir Walter
Scott have just been given by George
Croal, a venerable musician of Edin
burgh, who enjoys the distinction of
having talked to Sir Walter several
times and of being probably the only
survivor of those who heard him de
clare publicly that he was the long un
known author of "Waverley."
This famous announcement was, of
course, made at a dinner at the Edin
burgh assembly-room in 1827. Croal,
who played at the feast, was then ex
tremely young, but, like practically
everybody else in Scotland at the time,
he had been greatly interested in the
mystery over the authorship of "Wav
erley," and remembers vividly every
detail of the scene at the assembly
room.
â¢'Sir Walter's announcement did not
come quite as a surprise," says Croal,
"for it had been hinted that he would
reveal himself. I can recall the sup
pressed interest of the gathering
thrc/ughout the dinner proper. It was in
reply to the toast of his health that Sir
Walter admitted the soft impeachment.
I can remember his closing words ex
actly. They were.* 'I am the sole and
undivided author of "Waverley".' Need
less to say, there was great enthusiasm.
The company rose en masse and T
thought the roof would come off. Scott
was congratulated all around. It was a
gay night and the utmost conviviality
prevailed.
"He was lightsome and gay," Croal
says of Sir Walter, "and looked the
real type of a fine old Scottish gentle
man chatting animatedly with one of
the law lords sitting next to him. He
made a first-class after-dinner speaker,
and young though I was I carried away
a lasting impression of his kindly so
cial disposition.
"In the course of the evening," con
tinued the musician. "Sir Walter from
the head of the table complimented
Charles Mackay, the comedian, who
was present, upon his success in the
role of Bailie Xicol Jarvie, saying he
had made more of the character than
he could ever have anticipated. Mackay,
who was sitting near me, was embar
rassed, and I distinctly remember him
saying, 'Who would have thought I
would get such a compliment from the
great unknown?' "Not unknown now,
Mr. Bailie,' jocularly retorted Sir Wal
ter."
Later in life Croal was at Abbotuford
several times and once while there
was asked by Sir Walter Scott to play
some Scottish airs to him, "an invita
tion that I responded to with alacrity,"
says the old musician.
PKMBERTOX BREAKS RULE.
Max Pemberton has just paid a
young writer the compliment of ac
cepting a plot from and undertaking
to write a novel in collaboration with
him. The ybuthful author in ques
tion is Arthur Lambton, who is the son
of General Lambton of the Guards
and a cousin of the Earl of Durham.
Ho is a graduate of Cambridge. This
is the first time that Pemberton ever
has consented to make use of any plot
not invented by himself, though he de
clares that hundreds are offered to
him every year. The novelist's sug
gestion to Lambton was that they
write first a story and then a play
around his idea, and this plan prob
ably will be carried out. Pemberton
th;nks that the chief role in the play
wculd exactly suit Beerbohm Tree.
Eden Philpotts, who wrote "The Hu
man Boy" and recently increased his
reputation with "The American
nulled on account of fears for the sta
bility of the bridge over the Gila River
near Maricopa. The . employment of
work trains and a big force of men in
an # effort to prevent disaster to tracks
and bridges is the flood condition here
to-night.
The Gila River is higher than ever
before known, and though the crest of
the flood has not reached the Maricopa
bridge the river is reported higher at
Kelvin than the flood of three weeks
ago, which carried out or injured all
the bridges. If the Maricopa bridge
weathers to-night's rise train service
may bf> resumed to-morrow. The Phoe
nix and Eastern bridges are badly dam
aged, but are not swept away. The
Santa Fe expects to have trains run
ning to-morrow, but it is doubtful, as
several miles of roadbed is believed to
be unsafe. At Cave Creek great injury
has been done to the track. The trains
that left this morning went to Alham
bra, five miles from here, and were
abandoned, the passengers coming back
in carriages through water three or four
feet deep.
The storm is general all over Ari
zona. Aside from the railroad condi
tions the city has been all day in ex
citement from the surface flood that
swept across the country from the
mouth of Cave Creek, which Is ordinar
ily swallowed up in the de6ert above
Glendale. The flood from this desert
stream crossed the Arizona canal to
the embankment of the Santa Fe road,
then swept back southeast along the
embankment, and crossing the west
end of the city surrounded the Territo
rial Capitol building with a lake. The
water lacked an inch or two of entering 1
the buhding. The grounds were sub
merged and officials reached their of
fices only In carriages. In that section
of the city dozens of houses were in
vaded by the flood. Dozens of ranches
and dairy farms in the path of the
flood were submerged to the depth of
two or three feet, but the water is now
falling.
Electrical Storm at Auburn.
AUBURN. Feb. 4. â A heavy elec
trical storm visited this city to-night.
A flash of lightning struck the tele
phone wires in front of the Freeman
Hotel and stripped off 100 feet of the
nonconductor covering.

Prisoner," has a new story ready for
publication which he believes to be
the best thing he has done. This is
another tale of Mr. Philpotts* f;ivorite
country, Dartmoor, and it will be
called "The Secret Woman." It is not
generally known that before Philpotts,
who was born in India, took to author
ship he was a clerk in an insurance of
fice. Later on he thought he would
like to be an actor, but didn't make
a go of it. Then he began writing
short stories and found his true pro
fession. As a novelist of Devonshire,
Philpotts is a worthy successor to the
late R. D. Blackmore, author of
"Lorna Doone," whose memorial in
Exeter Cathedral he unveiled last
year.
Although the almost perfect 1594
quarto of "Titus Andronlcus." which
has Just come to light in Sweden, will
bo brought to this country before long,
nobody doubts that it will be acquired
by one of the wealthy American col
lectors. "It is a dreadful pity," said
one of the best known English biblio
graphers yesterday, "but the British
Museum can't afford > buy it at a
high price." It is expected that the
quarto, whose only blemish consists
in the absence of about ten words,
erased or scraped from the text in
some manner, will bring anything be
tween $3000 and $5000.
Until the 1594 quarto of Shakespeare's
play was found last month in the house
of a Swedish country-woman no single
copy of this first edition had been
known to exist. It is true t"hat the edi
tion is recorded in Arber's "Transcript
of the Registers of Stationers" in Lon
don, but hitherto most authorities have
regarded this as a sham entry, such be
ing not uncommon. The precious liter
ary relic is pow in the hands of the
librarian of Lund University of Swe
den. Already an offer of $1500 for it
has been refused.
E. Temple Thurston. husband of the
authoress of "John Chilcote. M. P.," has
also written a novel. It is called "The
Apple of Eden" and its subject is the
possibility of a celibate priesthood.
Meanwhile Mrs. Katherine Cecil Thurs
ton has finished a romance which will
be published serially on this side of the
water by the Lady's Realm. This story
is not yet named, its authoress having
discovered that the title she originally
had chosen had been used fcready.
Queerly enough, she had exactly the
same experience with "Chilcote."
Readers over here who admired Mar
maduke Pickthalls first novel, "Said
the Fisherman," are waiting for his
new novel with a lot of interest. It is
called "Brendle" and is a story of Eng
lish provincial life. This book should
demonstrate whether Plckthall needs
the inspiration of the East to produce
a novel of the quality of "Said." It is
rather suspected that he does, for it
was the opinion of practically all the
critics that his second novel, "Enfd."
which was a story of country life in
England, was not to be compared with
his romance of the Oriental adven
turer. \
VKREIN ARION MASKKD BALL
IN UNION-SQUARE HALL
German Sinpi.ig; Society Dances Be-
hind Other Faces and Has an
Enjoyable Time.
The masquerade ball given last night
in Union-square Hall by the German
singing society, Vereln Arion, was, de
spite the inclemerfcy of the weather,
well attended, not only by maskers,
who' crowded the dance floor, but by
spectators, who filled the galleries.
There were many in the grand march,
a number of the ladles being in pretty
costumes. The men appeared in odd
attire. The most striking figure in the
march was a policeman made up to
represent a weight of four hundred
pounds. There was guesÃing and
plenty of fun until the unmasking,
aftfer which the dance was continued
until intermission, when supper was
served to 200 persons. As the function
was under the direction of a commit
tee that passed upon each application
for cards of admission, it was very se
lect. The floor manager was Dr. F. W.
Staff, and the members of the commit
tee were: F. Hageman Jr., president;
A. Becker, John fSimmen, John Her
mann, C. Heinz, William John and E.
A. Otto.
WILL SEE SON
PLAY HAMLET
Special Dispatch tv The Call.
O6XDOX, Feb. 4. â London play
goers are curious to see if H. B. Irv
ing, Sir Henry's eldest son, will make
i anything like # striking a success in
j the part of "Hamlet" as his famous
j sire did thirty years ago. Oddly
I enough, "Harry" Irving, who will play
| the Dane for the first time at the
i Adelphi soon under the management
I of Otho Stuart, stands to-day almost
exactly where his distinguished father
stood prior to his appearance as
! Hamlet. He has made himself rec-
I ognized is one of the ablest actors on
I the British stage, but is not yet re
garded as a "great" player. Of course
j after the memorable night at the Ly
| ceum when Henry Irving first played
| Matthias in "The Bells" there was lit
tle doubt that he would take his place
sooner or later as a tragedian of the
first rank, but it was not until his
Hamlet was seen at the same the
ater in 1874 that he took his place at
the head of his profession.
H. B. Irving â whose initials stand
for Henry Broadribb â is 35, or slight
ly younger than his father was when
he appeared at the Prince of Den
murk. It would be an exaggeration to
say that his most successful perform
ance, so far â that of Sir William
Beauvedere in "The Ambassador" â
was as striking in its way as his fath
er's acting in "The Bells," but this
impersonation made it seem certain
that the younger Irving would be soon
at the top of the tree. Unfortunately
since then H. B. Irving has had no
part that gave him a chance to be
"great," but it is doubtful if his per
formance of Crichton in Barrio's play
could have been bettered and he was
uncommonly good as Letchmere in
Pinero's "Letty" and as Orlando in
"The Twin Sister."
STUDENT AXD WRITER.
He is a student and a writer â chiefly
on matters connected with < riminology
âand has published two thoughtful
works, "French Criminals <-f the Nine
teenth Century" and "The Life of
Judge Jeffreys." His Hamlet will be a
profound character study, whatever
else it is, and he will have the advan
tage of being supported l>y the Adelphi
company of old Bensonians. who,
though they began badly a while ago
with "The Prayer of the Sword," are
now enjoying prosperity with "The
Taming of the Shrew." In the coming
production of "Hamlet" Oscar Asche
will be the' King and his wife, Lily
Brayton, the Ophelia.
Probably there will be no more inter
ested spectator of his son's perform
ance in "Hamlet" than Sir Henry Irv
ing himself. The Knight is in London
at preeent, but leaves for Portsmouth
at the end of the week to begin a :>ro
vincial tour, which will last until Eas
ter. Then he opens at Drury Lane for
three months, playing his repertoire,
and in the autumn will leave for the
United States on what is almost certain
to be his last tour there. In 1906 Sir
Henry's farewell appearances in Lon
don will be made â or at least so he
thinks now.
Mrs. Langtry has put on "Mrs. Der
ing's Divorce" at Terry's for a season
of only six weeks, and from the play's
reception it hardly seems likely that
this time will have to be extended. As
in the United States, the piece has been
adjudged rather thin, and there is this
against it. too. that the identical situ
ation is treated much more amusingly
in "The Freedom of Suzanne," Marie
Tempest's play at the Criterion. Crit
ics, however, find Mrs. Langtry's act
ing much improved and that she haa
gained in ease and confidence.
AUTHOR OXCE WRESTLED.
Jean Riehepin, who has come to Lon
don to see his "Dv Barry" play pro
duced by Mrs. Brown-Potter, doesn't
l(vk In the least like a dramatist. He
is over six feet tall and has a skin that
is almost copper colored. As a mat
ter of fact, Rlchepin had no Idea of
ADVERTISEMENTS
becoming a playwright in the begin
ning. He was born in Africa â hence his
swarthy complexion â and started life
by trying to teach. Then he became
a professional wrestler at fairs and
developed his muscle to some purpose.
After that he went "before the mast"
in a trading vessel and wrote verses
during the night watches. Tiring of
this, he lived with a band of perform
ing gypsies until one cf the ladies of
the ompany offered him her heart.
Richepin knew that if he refused he
would certainly be stabbed by the in
dignant lady, so he fled from her to
Paris and became from that moment
merely a literary man.
He lectured in London several years
ago and greatly edified audiences by
his sinceritj', by the fact that he had
no notes to lecture from and by the
manner in which he fished up the mor
sel of sugar which lay at the bottom of
bis glass of water and sucked it vig
orously in the midst of one of his most
impassioned sentences.
Before this time, no doubt, a lot of
melodramas with airships in them have
been produced in the United States, but
the first piece of the kind to see the
light on this side of the water has just
been given in Paris. It is a spectacular
drama in four acts, called "The Con
quest of the Air" and written by Arch
deacon. the aeronaut, and Camille
Audisi<?r. ThÂ» plot is based on facts
known to Parisians, and has to do with
an unfortunate airship inventor, who,
after ruining himself with his experi
ments, falls into the hands of un
scrupulous financiers, who steal some
oÂ£ his plans and sell him up. The big
scene of the play shows the first plat
form of the Eiffel tower, with a real
istic ascent of the inventor's airship.
Something goos wrong and the ma
chine falls and is wrecked, the un
lucky genius receiving mortal injuries.
The piece is thrilling throughout and is
a hit at the Ambigu.

Mendardi Takes the Slab
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 4.â
By a whirlwind finish in the ninth
inning the baseball team from St.
Mary's College won the second of Stan
ford's preliminary games this after
noon. Until the last inning the car
dinal team was in the leai}, having
scored two runs to the Catholic col
legians' one. Then a hit, a \ralk, ah
error and another hit brought in three
tallies for St. Mary's and won the
game. Stanford's two runs were made
in the seventh. Cadwalader walked.
Rook pushed one through Haley that
was too hot for him to handle aad Cad
walader reached home on the error.
Then Chalmers hit a. single into left
field and Rook raced home with the
second score.
Gbacb Oowdeu tried out three pitch
ers during the game. Sales had all his
customary spe^d and control, and, al
though he gave three of the six hits
which St. Marys found, he kept them
well scattered, and there was never any
danger of scoring while he was in the
box. Rook, a new player who is not
eligible f->r the varsity team because
he comes from another college, was even
more successful than his predecessor.
He allowed neither hit nor run. It was
off Menardi, a freshman, who pitched
the last two innings, that the visitors'
scoring was done. Three hits and an
error did the work.
The game showed Stanford will have
a faster team this year than last. Fen
ton, the freshman who is covering
third, is a find. He hits well and fields
in perfect style. The team showed
traces of a tendency to . go up in the
air with the game won, which has been
fatal to cardinal hopes of success dur
ing recent years. Still, the outlook for
a good team is not .nearly so dark as
it was at the beginning of the season.
As usual, the team fielded well, but the
players showed a lamentable weakness
at the bat* The teams were made
up of:
Stanford â Fit:hers. Sales, Rook,
Menardi: catchers. Stott, Daily; first
base. Colbert: second base. Frink. Bell;
third bas<=. Fenton; shortstop, Trow

Capture the Junior Play
ers' Doubles Tournament
Two tennis tournaments were finished
yesterday on the park courts. In the

To the surprise of the spectators she
defeated Miss Van Viiet easily in the
finals. The handicap was only "owe
1-6" and cut no figure. Miss Wegener
won in straight sets, neither of which
was close.
Miss Van Vliet has her name on the

her to secure her third and final vic
tory yesterday.
On the occasion of their last meting
Miss Wegener gave Miss Van Vliet
odds of "owe 3-6" and Miss Van Vliet
won easily. Miss TVegener kept her op
ponent in the back court and played
everything to her back hand. These
tactics undoubtedly won the day for
her. The score was 6-3, 5-3.
In the semt-nnals Miss Wegener had
an equally easy time disposing of Miss
B. Cully. The latter received odds of
"3-6" and "owe 15 3-6." The score was
6-2, 6-3.

JAPANESE LABORERS
ARE READY FOR A FIGHT
Brown Men Form Garrison and Pre-
pare to Resist Attempt to Drive
Them From Town.
DEXVER, Feb. 4.â Fifteen Japanese
employed to chop railroad ties near
Arrowhead, threatened with deporta
tion by indignant white men, have
formed a garris~n and post sentinels
nightly, being determined to resist the
attempts to run them out.
Arrowhead is the present terminal of
Moffatt road. Geo*rge Easton, the
contractor, employed the Japanese and
claims he did so because he could not
get white men. When the brown men
reached Arrowhead the citizens of the
town held a conference and decided the
Japanese must go.
"Take them away or there will be
trouble." was the ultimatum.
Meanwhile the Japanese leaned on
their axes and kept their peace. Last
night they formed a garrison and post
ed' sentinels. They were not disturbed,
but the feeling against them continues
intense and the white Inhabitants of
Arrowhead, several hundred In num
ber, say they cannot stay. They have
been given three days In which to
leave the town.

that no taint of this loathsome malady remained in his blood to be transmitted to posterity

THE SWIFT SPECIFIC COMPANY, ATLANTA, GAs
DEFEND SHOOT
IN TWO BRIEFS
Counsel Deny the Right
of the Senate to Unseat
the Member From Utah
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â Separate
briefs will be filed on Monday with the
| Senate Committee on Privileges and
f Elections by A. S. Worthington of this
i city and .Waldemar Van Cott of .Salt
Lake City, counsel for Senator Smoot
' in the investigation of protests against
the latter retaining his seat in the
Senate. , v ; : ;
Worthington deals with the Question
< whether it requires a ' thirds , vote
or a majority vote to vacate Senator
â  I Smoo seat. He ; contends, on prin-
c iple and on precedent, that when Sen
ator Smoot was sworn in the question
of his qualification was passed upon
* once for ail; that ihe can be removed
now only by a vote of expulsion and
only on the ground that since he was
elected to the Senate he has committed
. some 1 criminal offense ' and that to . do
this will require a two-thirds vote. .
â¢ The endowment ceremony, polygamy
and the alleged interference ;of the
Mormon people in politics are discussed
by } Worthington, â¢ following practically
the same line- of his oral ; argument to
the committee- He insists that while
the constitution 'of the United States
prohibits 'Â£ the : National Government
from making any law.- regarding * the
establishment of a religion, It does not
forbid the States from doing so, but
leaves the matter ;to the States them
selves to , determine.
Worthington * contends that it is en
tirely competent for any religious or
ganization to become a political organi
f sation; also , for ; any. religious organi
zation 4to make ? religious " principles a
part of its v platform and to .. work
I through religious :, organizationsâ that
i this 1 is a matter not of law. but |of taste
and propriety. ,; V' ' '
Van Cott, in his brief, discussed the
political phase of the investigation al
most entirely. He said:
"The contention of the protestants to
the effect that Senator Smoot could be
unseated because he believes that man
is capable of receiving revelations from
God is idle. If the objection is good
Utah should not have been admitted as
a State, because this belief of the Mor
mon people was known before state
hood. .If the objection is tenable, no
gentile in the United States who be
lieves in man's capability for receiving
revelations could become a United
States Senator. The Reorganised
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints and many people of different re
ligious persuasions believe In man's ca
pacity to receive revelations."
In conclusion. Van Cott argues that
Senator Smoot should be encouraged,
as he is "opposed to the practice of po
lygamy and stands for obedience to all
the laws and good citizenship, and if
he is ousted it logically follows that no
Mormon can be a United States Sena*
tor # that Mormons will only be fit to
vote for gentile Senators and cannot
themselves be Senators."

WEBER TRIAL
WILL PROCEED
Juror Berry Is Excused by
Consent of Both Sides and
His Successor Selected
Eaaelal XHaÃ*teh to ThÂ« CaJL
AUBURN, Feb. 4.â The taking of
testimony in the case of Adolph Weber,
accused of the murder of his mother,
Mary Weber, will begin on Monday
morning.
T. W. Berry, the juryman owing to
whose illness the case had been delay
ed for several days, was so ill to-day
that Judge Prewett excused him from
further service. Horatio Selfridge. a
liquor dealer of Rocklin, was chosen to
act In his stead. The selection of 3el
fridge was satisfactory to both sides.
When Judge l*rewett was advised by
Dr. Lund this afternoon that Berry
vcouid have to be carried into the court
room on a stretcher he Immediately
summoned the attorneys on both sides
for an expression of opinion. Attorney
General Webb, for the prosecution, and
Attorney Grove L. Johnson, for the de
fense, were both in Sacramento. The
prosecution was therefore represented
by District Attorney Robinson and At
torney Hamilton and the defense by
Attorneys Tuitle, Tabor and PnTlâ
After a short conference. In which At
torney Tuttle wanted the other jurors
dismissed and as entire new Jury se
lected and to which procedure the Dis
trict Attorney strenuously objected.
Judge Prewett decided to proceed with
the trial with the original eleven jurors
and to select a new juror.
The court at once issued a special
venire, returnable at 7:M o'clock to
night. Promptly at the hoar named
twelve of the talesmen appeared at the
Courthouse.
The first man called to the stand
was S. C. Day. who was excused on the
ground that his serving would great
ly endanger his business at this season
of the year. Horatio Selfridge was next
called. He was only under examlna

ARGENTINA
Insurrection Breaks Out
in Southern Republic and
Buenos Ayres Government
Proclaims Martial Law
DUENOS ATRES. Argentine Repub
lic, Feb. 4. â An Insurrection has broken
out. Several police posts have been at
tacked by bands of about thirty men
each, the assailants nearly everywhere
being repulsed. Two posts, which were
surprised, were recaptured by the po
lice. An attack on the arsenal was re
pelled. It is rumored that two regi
ments of troops have mutinied and are
marching on the capital.
The Argentine Government, which
appears to have been acquainted with
the plans of the leaders of the plot,
took timely measures to suppress the
rising and seems to have complete con
trol of the situation.
As a result of the Insurrectionary
movement the Government has issued
a decree establishing a state of siege
for thirty days throughout the repub
lic and has ordered the mobilization of
the National Guard. \
The decision to proclaim a state of
siege and to mobolize the National
Guard was reached at a council of Min
isters held this morning under the
presidency of Manutl Quintana, Presi
dent of the republic. The troops re
maining loyal to the Government have
been Bent to meet the mutinous troops,
who are marching on Buenos Ayres.
Information received here from the
provinces of Mendoza, Cordova and
Santa Fe are contradictory. It is diffi
cult to secure definite information, and
many rumors are current. It is report-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. FEBRUARY 5, 1905,
Ed that the artillery stationed at Ro-.|
sario, in the province of Santa Fe, has
joined the insurrectionists.
President Quintana and the Cabinet
are holding a continuous session at the
Government house. The members of the
Cabinet assert that the revolutionary
movement is bound to fail, as it is di
rected by only. a. few influential per
sons, and that the attempt to overthrow
the Government will not meet with any
degree of popular approval. Banks are
open and trains are running.
The * revolt at Bahia Blanca, in the
south of the province of Buenos Ayres,
has already been crushed, and accord
ing to latest reports, which are con
sidered reliable, the movement In the
Interior Is dying down and the principal
centers remain loyal to the existing
regime.
According to official information one
battalion of infantry and a company of
engineers which revolted have returned
to barracks at Campo del Mayo and
readily submitted to discipline.
Troops from one of the provinces
have been dispatched to this city.
Think high pure thoughts and y\>ur
face will look that way.
INSANE' MAX CLIMBS

Performs All Kinds of Perilous Feats
in Midair n nti Then Safely De

SAN JOSE, Feb. 4. â For two hours
this morning citizens of Gilroy gazed
at a young man at the top of a 140
foot town flagstaff, while he per
formed all kinds of perilous feats.
Finally by means of the rope he de
scended, head downward, to the cross
bar, where he disrobed. At last he
came down and was taken into cus

and malicious statements concerning

WHILE HANDLING DYNAMITE
United States Court Commissioner
Laning of Fresno 3leets With
Serious Injury.
FRESNO, Feb. 4. â Frank Laning,
United States Court Commissioner,
had two of his fingers blown off this
afternoon while blasting at his ranch
in Arizona County. His hand is badly
mutilated and the surgeons have lit
tle hope of saving it above the wrist.
Laninj? was blasting holes in the hard
pan to plant trees. With a dynamite
cap in his right hand he lit the fuse
and accidentally threw the lighted
match into a bucket rhich contained
dynamite.
Laning was startltd by seeing the
dynamite in the bucket blaze fiercely
and forgot to throw away the cap he
was holding. The fuse burned down
and the cap went off, hurling Laning
to the ground, ba/tily mutilating his
right hand.
