GREAT ARMIES ENGAGED IN BATTLE ALONG A FRONT ONE HUNDRED MILES IN LENGHT
FIGHTING on a large scale is in progress between the Russian and Japanese armies in Manchuria. General Kuropatkin, after meeting the initiative of the
Japanese in the eastern part of the Shakhe Valley, assumed the aggressive in the western portion, under cover of heavy artillery fire from Putiloff HilJ and Nov
gorod Hill, succeeding in driving the Japanese from a position in the outskirts of Sandiapu. Simultaneously the Russians attacked and captured a railroad
bridge on the Japanese center. Much more serious is the Japanese movement against the Russian left wing, which threatens, unless quickly checked, to oblige
General Kuropatkin to abandon the positions on the Hun River which he has occupied and fortified during the winter.

pose of retaining his love or gaining
control over him.
Mrs. Cody testified that she was mar
ried to Colonel Cody in St. Louis forty
years ago; when she was 22 years of ,
age. V T Â« . â '*'/..':
"At the time we were married," she
said, 'Colonel Cody was employed on
the plains of Kansas as a teamster j
and shortly afterward became . en- i
gaged as a buflalo hunter for the rail- ;
road contractors on the Kansas di
vision of the Union Pacific. He killed .
- thousands of these' animals, which were
used by the graders for meat.
"In 1S6S we moved. to what was .then

lor several years. We were poor in
.- 'those day? and I lid what I could to i

ing in sewing. . Colonel Cody and I
did net have serious trouble during our
residence at Fort McPherson.
CODY'S STAGE CAREER OPENS.
"The Calonel went on the stage in
1S74 and shortly after this he took us ;
to Rochester, N. Y., where we lived
for four years. At the expiration of
this time we came back to Nebraska
and located here at North Platte. We
bought property here from time to time
Avith earnings of the Colonel's show
business. In 1693 we purchased our
residence here=in town. This was fixed
up in goqd style and I prepared to
welcome my husband home from Eng

his show." â .>/*'
"Was this home-coming the occasion ;
of the big ljiÂ£.nquet tendered by the
citizens of North Platte to the
Colonel." asked Attorney Halligan.
"Yes, sir."-,*'. . .
,\ "Mrs. Cody, did you ever administer ',
, a drug to Colonel Cody, or any liquid
that would injure him?"
"No, sir; I never did."
"You frequently doctored the colonel

Â£? "Did you ever give the colonel any
thing to make him sick?"
*â  "No. sir.**
ifDid you ever poison him?" c
"No, sir." o
DOG POISONING UNINTENTIONAL
P Replying, to further questions, Mrs.
Codjr declared she had never told Mrs.
jEoyer (a witness for the plaintiff) or
Vay other person that she, had ever
drugged her husband to make him love
her or to gain control over him so that
he would sign certain papers for her.
Mie a]so denied that she had ever pois
oned any of â be colonel's dogs inten
tionally.
"I told the men at the ranch," she
explained, to put out strychnine or
ether poison for the rats, which were
getting bothersome, and accidental
ly the colonel's dogs got some of the
poison. One ct the dogs in particular,
of which he colonel was very fond and
â which I liked myself for that reason,
wat killed, and I felt very badly
over it."
Mrs. Cody acknowledged she had
"punished her children "whenever they
reeded it." and had castigated them
"with a email riding whip. o
Mrs. Cody denied that she was ever
intoxicated as had been alleged by
witnesses for the plaintiff. She never
drank liquor except fqr medicinal pur
poses, she said, and never used profane
cr obpcer.e language. jfifeg

'.'Do you still love Colonel Cody?"
asked the attorney.
"Yesr he Is the father of my children
â nd I love him still."
"Do you desire a reconciliation at
his time?"
"Yes. â  I.do; but I think that the Col

Mrs. Cody recited the incidents of
the funtral trip from Spokane to Ro

LETTER FROM THE DEAD.
A pathetic scene occurred h"re,
when Attorney Wilcox introduced a
letter and asked Mrs. Cody to identify
it. Tears streamed down her cheeks,
and between her broken sobs she said
it was a letter to her received from
her daughter, Arta. three days before
Bhe died. Among other things writ
ten by Mrs. Thorpe (Arta) was the
statement that the bringing of the suit
for divorce by her father had broken
her heart.
Mrs. Cody denied that Colonel Pow
ell, manasrer of Colonel Cody's Wyom
ing interests, ever came to her at Roch
ester or any other place seeking a
reconciliation between her and her hus
band.
Mrs. Cody told of Cody's homecom
ing on Christmas. 1901. She said he
seemed glad to see her, and wheti he
went away on Christmas night he bade
her an affectionate farewell, kissing
her as he stepped aboard the train.
"This was the last I. heard from
Colonel Cody, either by letter or word
of mouth," said Mrs." Cody.
Under examination by Colonel H. S.
Ridgeley. chief counsel for the plain
tiff, Mrs. Cody became hysterical and
could ccarcelv answer questions.

TERRIFIC COMBAT FOR MASTERY
MUKDEN, Feb. 28. â Fighting was in process to-day
along the whole line, the Japanese attacking everywhere. All at
tacks this morning were beaten back and the Russians made
counter attacks at many places. On the rig-lit flank the Russians
occupied the village of Boatatzsi, which is close to Sandiapu, and
from that position hurled hand grenades across the intervening ra
vine into the Japanese trenches in Sandiapu, causing heavy
loss and great disorder.
The Russians have seized the head of the bridge across the
Shakhe River, in the center of the Jai>anese lines, assisted by ar
tillery tiring of particular energy from PutilorY Hill ajid Nov
gorod Hill.
The seizure of the bridge was the occasion of a sharp com
bat. The Russians succeeded in stirpn'sini; the Japanese bridge
guards, and, reinforced, beat oft" all attempts of the Japanese to re
gain possession of it.
The Japanese are using heavy artillery in the bombardment
of Putilorr Hill. The losses to the defending forces are insignifi
cant. The roar of artillery is going (>n uncea>ingiv from the
mountains to the eastward to the low flats oi the Hun River.
The tight appears to be developing in intensity
whole line.
Ten determined Japanese attacks opposite Yansingtung and
west of Vanupudzi were all repulsed with heavy loss.
The situation on the Russian left flank i* unchanged as com
pared with Monday evening.
ST. PETERSBURG. March Iâ Last
evening's news from Manchuria was of
the most important nature, a press dis
patch from Mukden, which was trans
mitted at noon of Tuesday, indicating
that a general battle was beginning
along the whole of the 100 miles of
front occupied by the two armies.
General Kuropatkin appears to have
taken a leaf out of Field Marshal
Oyama's book and replied to General
Kuroki's attack on the Russian left by
a counter attack on the Japanese left.
General Kaulber's initial success was
better for the Russians than the suc
cess of General Gripenberg, the Rus
sian vanguard being: established at the
outskirts of Sandlapu. At the same
time General Kuropatkin delivered a
blow against the Japanese center, seiz
ing a railroad bridge across the Shak
he River.
These reports give a more hopeful
aspect to the situation, as the Russian
army, though driven out of Da Pass,
appears to have succeeded in stopping,
at least for the moment, the further
advance of the Japanese eastward and
beaten off the attack on the center.
The effect of yesterday's develop
ments on General Knropatkin's re
ported intention to withdraw from the
Shakhe is problematical. Retirement
In the face of an enemy, which is ex
tremely hazardous under any circum
stances, is doubly dangerous when
the armies are grappling in a general
engagement; but if General Kuroki
succeeds in rolling up the Russian left
much further, the perilous expedient
may become necessary. The counter
strokes on the right and center may
possibly be intended to cover the with
drawal of trains and stores. If. how
ever. General Kuropatkin is deterr lined
to stand and fight out the battle on the
line which he has held during the
winter, and if he should be able to
administer a vigorous check to General
Kuroki. he has secured a good position
for his second move in the great game.

of the special committee that investi

at the University of California and re
ported in favor of holding the regents
of the college liable for the entire
amount of the defalcation of former
Secretary \Y. A. McKowen. Carter
moved the adoption of the report and
this raised the storm.
Senator Shortridge took the floor and
said that he opposed the report; that
it was an effort to hold men that had
done their full duty responsible for the
wrongs of another and he did not be
lieve this to be good policy. Curtin
then offered an amendment to the re
port, striking out all of that portion
directing that action be taken against
the Board of Regents to recover the
amount of McKowen's defalcation.
Lukens objected strongly to the
amendment, saying:
"I see no reason why the report
should not be adopted as it stands. 1
will admit that this is a case where
the heart strongly contends with the
intellect, but the fact stands, neverthe
less, that the committee report is the

reached after careful deliberation."
Senator Shortridge here interrupted
the speaker and moved that the resolu

overruled, however, and Lukens con
tinued:
'By his fair and open statements
President Wheeler made a very favor
able impression with us, as did all the
regents, and it was this very fairness
on their part that made it so plain to
us that negligence was responsible for
the loss to the university. It was plain
to us that the regents erred sadly in
the performance of their duties, though
no one believes for a moment that any
of 'hem was guilty of willful careless
ness. Unquestionably, however, ' they
were guilty of neglect and it was this
fact that caused this committee to

Senator Carter, chairman of the

entered the debare. He said he

doubted that they were competent to

BILL TO STOP
PRIZE FIGHTS
IS DEFEATED
Fate of Ralston's Meas
ure Settled by Vote
of 18 to 10.
Sptilal Dispatch ta The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 28.â Senator
Kalston's anti-prize fight bill was de
feated in the Senate by a vote of 18
to 10. The debate was limited to three
minutes for each member after a pro
test from Shortridge against gag-law.
Shortridge said the bill was per
nicious inasmuch as it limited the per
sonal liberty of the citizens. He said
further that the representative citizens
of San Francisco could be found at
the ringside at the Corbett-Nelson
fight.
Senator Wolfe made an attack on the
measure because it provided for ama
teur contests \*here the untrained and
physically unfit were aUowed to pum
mel one another to their permanent
disablement in many cases.
Ralston advocated his measure by
referring to the number of fake fights
that take place and also to the unde
sirable citizens that are developed in
a prize ring environment. He said that
the youth of the State needed the sup
pression of the prize ring, if it would
develop to its fullest possibility. The
Senator gave notice of reconsideration
of the vote whereby the bill was lost.
Senator Hahn's bill providing for the
establishment of a highway from San
Francisco to San Diego passed the
Senate. The bill carries an appropria
tion of $15,000.
FIGHT OVKR GAME LAWS.
Desperate Attempt Made to Amend
Bill ITouvtinK Birds.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2S.â A desper
ate attempt to amend the Assembly
committee substitute fish and game
bill, substituted by Shortridge for his
own, as it contains identical provisions,
made in the Senate this atternoon,
but without success in a single in
stance. The most objectionable fea
ture of the original bill, which prohib
ited the hunting of ducks in rowboats,
had been eliminated in committee so
the opponents of the measure were de
prived of their strongest argument
against the justice of the bill, it bi-ing
admitted that had this provision re
mained in the bill the hunting of water
fowl would have been a pleasure alone
for the rich, who own all of the pre
serves of the State.
Wolfe first attacked the provision
which makes it a misdemeanor for any
person to have in his possession on
any one day more than, twenty quail,
partridge, doves, snipe, curlew, Ibis,
plover, rail or other shore bird, or more
than fifty ducks. Wolfe offered an
amendment which would permit keep
ers of markets to have more than the
numbers set forth, providing, however,
that they do not purchase more than Js
provided in the bag limit from any one
person.
Proponents of the bill held that such
an amendment would only encourage
infractions of the law and it was
beaten by a vote of 21 to 5.
Leavitt sought to increase the num
ber of deer any one hunter may kill
during the open season from two to
three, but he was defeated. IJeavitt
and "Wolfe then announced that they
would offer other amendments to the
bill when it conges up for third read
ing and said they were positive with a
full Senate of winning their points.
The discussion on the game bill con
cluded, the general appropriations bill
was taken up. The only changes of
importance related to the reduction of
the number .of reporters of appellate
court decisions from three to one, thus
saving the State $9600 a year and re
ducing the salaries of the bailiffs there
of to $100 a month.
SCHOOIi BITvIj PASSES.
Apportionment Measure Is Sent to
Governor by Senate. .
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 28.â The Slaven
school apportionment bill passed the
Senate to-night after a debate, Senator
Hambo being the only member of the
House, outside of the Sa"n Francisco
delegation, who voted against it. Bauer
of San Francisco voted for it.
"I represent the- people of San Fran
cisco and I am going to vote for the
bill, because I think it just," Bauer
said.
"You misrepresent your constituents
and have done it before," said Wolfe.
"This bill robs San Francisco of $215,'
000. It is said that the effect of its
enactment will be to increase the num- j
ber of school days in the country dls- j
trlcts. It will not increase them at all. j
but will simply result in the reduction j
of country school taxes at the expense '>
of San Francisco. Yjdu will find two j
years from now that I am rightâ such
of you as come back.'"
Ward, Carter and Shortridge spoke
for the bill, as did Anderson, Who said
he favored it, though it took some
money from his own county. Keane
made a speech against the measure,
but as was the case In the Assembly,
the interior members had combined to
pass the bill and opposition was use
less. The vote was twenty-seven to
five. The bill is now ready for the
Governor.
BUNKERS RELEASED.
Boodler Obtains Freedom Aftei
Spending Night in Jail.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 28. â After
spending nearly thlrt3'-six hours in the
County Jail while his attorneys were
â scouring the city and State for bonds
men, Harry Bunkers, recently thrown
out of thÂ« Senate for accepting a bribe
and getting caught at it, was released
at 8:25 o'clock to-night. At that hour
John C. Scroggs, formerly State gard
ener, appeared and qualified in the
sum of $2500 and Bunkers walked
out a free man.
Bunkers' bondsmen are Joseph Kel
ly, Oakland, $5000, and H. C. John
son and John C. Scroggs, both of Sac
ramento, each $2500.
BOODLERS ARE QUIET.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 28.â Not even
an echo of the boodlers' scandal
sounded in the Senate to-day. Wright,
v in has several bills awaiting action,
called at the sergeant at arms' room
to surrender his interest in the meas
ures m Senator Shortridge, his col
league from Santa Clara, and then de
parted. Emmong is rapidly improving
and will be out, his physicians say,
within the course of a few weeks.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1905.
ASSEMBLYMEN
LIKE PRESENT
CONSTITUTION
Deleat Plan Providing lor
a Revision of tbe
State Laws,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 28.â Goodrich's
concurrent resolution for the calling of
a convention to revise the State con
stitution was defeated in the Assem
bly this morning. There was little dis
cussion. The author of the resolution
explained that the existing document
had become cumbersome and in many
ways unfitted to the present day, ow
ing to new conditions that had arisen.
Anthony spoke in favor of letting the
present document prevail instead of
flying to unknown evils. There was a
rather surprising apathy considering
the importance of the subject.
The bill giving the Harbor Commis
sion of San Francisco power to insure
without limit the State property under
its control, was passed. The bill was
once defeated, but McGowan, who se
cured the reconsideration, secured its
passage by calling attention to the dis
astrous fire in Boston and the more
recent one in New Orleans, by which
much State property was destroyed.
Assemblyman Jones of Tuolumne
called the attention of the lower House
to the fact that his bill abolishing the
annual registration fee that dentists
must pay to the State Board of Dental
Examiners, which had been put in the
hands of the Committee on Public
Health and Quarantine, had disap
peared. He asked permission to in
troduce a substitute and have it given
the same standing as the original,
which had been favorably reported by
the Judiciary Committee. Speaker
Prescott said he would look Into the
law on the matter and give a ruling
to-morrow morning;.
Amerige's bill prohibiting all profes
sional prize fights, the Assembly dupli
cate of the Ralston bill in the Senate,
has reached the third reading file in
the lower House and will be urged
for final passage by its author as soon
as its turn comes. It may pass before
final action is taken on the Senate
measure. It is said that the bill is
not in a form to stand before the Su
preme Court, as the title is defective.
Amerige discovered to-day that his
bill "to prohibit boycotting, unfair lists,
picketing or other interference with the
lawful business or occupation of
others," had been sunk by some means
or another to a place on the file far
below that which it should occupy and
through a protest to the Speaker he
had it lifted to its proper place. It will
come up this week for final passage.
The Assembly to-night passed the
following bills: . â

FIX GAS RATE
AT ONE DOLLAR
Division of Supervisors to
Close on Committee's Re
port Favoring 90 Cents
The Supervisors last ntght fixed the
gas rate for the coming fiscal year, be
ginning- July 1, 1905, at $1 per 1000. '
The majority committee report;
signed by Sanderson and McClellan,
favored a rate of 90 cents. Gallagher
offered the minority, report, recom
mending a rate of 75 cents.
Gallagher's motion was not adopted,
I being defeated by a vote of 17 to 1.
The majority report was also thrown
out by a vote of 10 to 8. The vote on
I the majority report was as follows:
[ Ayesâ Alpers, Bent, Boxton, Gallagher,
; Lunstedt, McClellan, Rea, Sanderson;
( noes â Booth, Brandenstein, Braunhart,
} Connor, Comte, d'Ancona, Eggers,
Hocks, Rock, Payot.
Supervisor Brandenstein presented an
amendment to the bill offered by the
majority report, fixing the rate at $1
instead of 90 cents. Supervisors Rock
j and Hocks, who stood for the 90-cent
Irate, switched and voted for the $1
i-rate, making the passage of the bill
i possible.
The electricity rate for heat, light
and power was passed without oppo
sition at 9 cents per 1000 watt hours
with the same discount allowed from
rates as heretofore fixed by the pre
vailing ordinance. This is a reduction
of 2 cents per 1000 watt hours on basis
rate fixed by prevailing ordinance.
Allan Pollock, manager of the
gas company, announced that the gas
company would give the city an in
crease or 100 arc lights and 200 gas
lamps. ;
The gas rate adopted is a reduction
of 20 cents from the legal rate in
vogue. There having been no rate
fixed by the Board of Supervisors last
year, the gas company voluntarily
fixed the rate at SI, and the rate es
tablished last night will therefore not
be actually decreased.
The ordinance fixing the water rate
last year, and, now the basis of a suit
in the United States Circuit Court,
instituted by the Spring Valley Wa
ter Company against the city, was re
enacted last night on the report of
the Water Committee. Supervisor
Comte atdod- alone, as he did last
year, against the passage of the ordi
nance fixing the water rate.

MORMON CHIEF
LIKE MONARCH
Senator Kearns Describes
the Power and Surround
ings of President Smith
HIS INCOME ENOBMOUS
One-Tenth of All the Earn
ings of His People Are
Placed at His Disposal
WASHINGTON, Feb. !>S.â When the
Dubois anti-polygamy resolution came
up for discussion in the Senate to-day
Senator Kearns of Utah, in a speech
which was in the nature of his farewell
address to the Senate, bitterly de
nounced the Mormon church, to which
he owes his retirement to private life.
His remarks bristled with accusations
of broken faith upon the part of the
Mormon leaders In their failure to ob
serve the terms of their compact with
the Federal Government.
"Utah secured her statehood by a
solemn compact made by the Mormon
leaders in behalf of themselves and
their people. That compact has been
broken willfully and frequently. No
apostle of the Mormon church has pub
licly protested against that violation,"
said Kearns.
"I know the gravity of the utterances
that I have just made. I know what
are the probable consequences to my
self. But I have pondered long and
earnestly upon this subject, and have
come to the conclusion that drty to
the innocent people of my State and
obligation to the Senate and the coun
try require that I shall clearly define
my attitude."
Kearns described the surroundings
and the powers of President Smith,
who, he said, affected a regal state and
had established himself with the dig
nity of a monarch. He continued:
In all this social system each apostle has
his great part. He is inseparable from it.
He wields now such part of the power as the
monarch may permit him to enjoy, and k is
hia hope and expectation that he will outlive
those who are his seniors in rank, in order
that he may become the ruler.
Taking up the business policy of the
I church, Kearns charged that it
â  amounted to a monopoly. He recited
| the holdings of President Smith, by
j virtue of his office, as well as his pri
vate holdings, and said that when
â  Smith became president he boasted of
j his property, while now he "is in
: receipt of an income like unto that
i which a rwsil family derives from a
1 national treasury. One-t ,ith of all
the annual earnings of all the Mor-
I mons in all the world flows to him.
Th-se funds amount to $1,600,000 an
nually."
Speaking of the tithing system,
Kearns paid that no account was made
iof this \ast sum of one-tenth of ill
the incomes of the Mormons, and that
the i resident of the church expended
it according to his own will. He said
the hopelessness of contending In a
husihees Â«v with this autocrat wan
perfectly apparent, and continued:
It will astound you to know that every
, dollar of United States money paid to any
servant of the Government who is a Mormon
is tithed for the benefit of this monarch. Out
of every thousand dollars thus paid he gets
$100 to #well his grandeur. This- is also true
of money "paid out of the public- treasury of
the State of Vtah to Mormon officials. But
what is worst of all. the monarch dips into
. Â«acred public school, funds and extracts from
' every Mormon teacher one-tenth of his or
! her earnings and uses it for his . unaccounted
purposes; and by means of these purposes
and the power which they constitute he de
fies, the laws of his State, the- sentiment of
his country and Is waging a war of nulllflca-
I tion on the p.ublic school system cso dear to
; the American ' people. No right thinking man
. will oppose any person as a servant of the
: nation or the State .or as a teacher in the
I public schools on account of religious faith,
i A* I have before remarked, this is no war
j upon, the religion of the Mormons; and I
, am only calling attention to the monstrous
i manner in which thin monarch Invaded all the
} provtnaes of human life and endeavors to se
cure his rapacious ends.
The election of Sena|or Rawllns was
charged by Kearns to have been due
entirety to the Mormon church, in or
der to humiliate a deposed apostle.
Speaking of the marriage relation,
Kearns said:
Plural marriare relations ha** been con
tinued defiantly, according to the will â¢ and
pleasure of those who had. formerly violated
the law. and for â whose obodfence to law the
church monarchy pledged the. faith artd honor
of Us leaders and followers alike In order, to
obtain statehood.
Kearns Charged that not more than
three of the four of the luoram oC
the apostles have ref raised from prac
ticing polygamy, and that "spociaf rea- 'â 
sons may fixist in some particular case
why aÂ° ma.ii in this class has not en
tered into such relation-*'

EXTEXT OF KUROKI'S VICTORY.
Strategic Advantage Gained by the
Japanese Forces.
GENERAL KUROKI'S HEAD
QUARTERS, Sunday, Feb. 26. â The
Japanese yesterday (Saturday) achiev
ed a signal victory over the forces
commanded by Lieutenant General
Rennenkampf. While this victory is.
important in itself, it is more so be
cause of the strategic advantage gain
ed by the Japanese. The fighting was
over a mountainous country between
thirty and forty-nve miles east of Yen
tai, which is about fifteen miles north
east of Liaoyang.
General Kuroki's infantry again dis
played remarkable qualities as hill
fighters and proved their superiority
to the famous cavalry of the Russians.
The right of the Japanese winter po
sition has been near Ponchi, extending
toward the southeast, on the south of
the Shake River and west of the Taitse
River. In yesterday's movement a
body of Japanese troops which had
been advancing from Ponchi swung
around toward the northeast and
swept the Russians before them.
The Japanese now hold strong lines
extending from southwest to northwest
and partly eastward of the Taitse
River, threatening the Russian left
flank.
General Rennenkampf commanded
one and a half divisions of cavalry, a
division of infantry and a body of
sharpshooters, with full complements
of guns.
The principal engagement was north
east of Tsinkhetchen, where the Rus
sians held strongly defended entrench
ments.
The Russians left 203 dead on the
field there and loÂ£t several machine
guns. Their casualties are estimated
at more than 2000.
ASSASSINS GROWING BOLDER
Formal Letters Notify Vladimir of
His Death Sentence.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 28.â The
utter lmpotency of the police in the
face of the terrorist organization Is
shown by the increasing boldness of
the latter throughout St. Petersburg.
Even on the side of the public build
ings simple notices of Grand Duke
Sergius' 'death wei?e found. They read:
, The sentence of death passed upon Sergius
Alexandrovitch was executed February 17.
THE FIGHTING ORGANIZATION OF THE
SOCIAL DEMOCRAT PARTY.
Moreover, the notices were neatly
printed, a thing unknown in the days
lof the late Interior Minister yon
j Plehwe, when similar notices were al
! ways run off on copying machines.
I The secret police then were too closely
upon the heels of the terrorists to per
mit the use of a printing press.
The Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna, I
whose husband, the Grand Duke Vladi
mir, is high on the list of tjtiose con
demned to death, is trying to shield
his life' with, her own. Since "Red!
Sunday" the Grand Duke has not only
been showered with threats and warn
,ings, but has twice received from
abroad formal letters signed by dif
ferent â  groups, informing him of his
sentence to death and of .the assign
ment of men to execute it. At the
same time, the Grand Duchess Marie,
like the Grand Duchess Elizabeth, in
the case of Grand Duke Serglus, was â 
notified that her life and her son's life
would be spared and she was appealed
to not to go abroad in her husband's
[ company. The letters naturally ter
rorized the family and household of
the Grand Duke, who has aged greatly
during the last, few weeks."
STOESSEL YET A HERO.
Moscow's Reception to the Warrior Is

MOSCOW, Feb. 28.â General Stoes
sc-1, who left here this evening for St.
Petersburg, attended services at the
Choudoff monastery with his wife this
morning. Grand Duchess Sergius,
who also was present, invited General
and Mrs. Stoessel to breakfast with
I her.
Great crowds besieged General
j Stoessel's' hotel throughout the day
j and he was obliged to use the side
1 doors in order to avoid popular dem
i onstrations. The Mayor of Moscow,
! aecornpained by officials of the muni-
I eipality presented bread and salt to
him.
General Stoessel in replying to the i
Mayor's, speech of welcome, spoke j
feelingly of the necessity that had
forced him to surrender Port Arthur,
which he said he had done only as a
last resort and in order to avoid the
slaughter that would have resulted
from the taking of the city by assault.
He said that until the last moment
they had hoped for relief from General
Kuropatkin and Vice- Admiral Rojest
vetisky.

TOKIO. March I.â A meeting of
bankers and financiers was held to
day to discuss the subscriptions to the
new domestic loan should it be found
to be oversubscribed when the list is
opened. At the close of the meeting
the associated bankers announced that
they would take 60,000,000 yen (about
$30,000,000). The imperial household
will take 5.000,000 yen and other cor
porations and individuals 40,000,000 yen.

Count Okuma, addressing to-day's
meeting, said that the Japanese do
mestic financial capacity was astonish
ing- even to its friends. He expressed
the belief that the slight disturbance in

that agriculture supplied the country's
great wealth. Continuing Count Oku

and Weds an American
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CiiL

Miss Howe, who has spent most of
her time in the last fifteen years In
London, last got into public notice by
the announcement of her engagement
to Count Charles de Cmi of Rome. The
wedding was to have taken place in
London last November. Six weeks be
fore the wedding day Count de Cmi,
while in Pittsburg, made a proposi
tion to his fiancee. It was that he
should have $50,000 cash, that she
should pay all his -debts and also settle

cently sent the Coun* word that he
need not return to Pittsburg, as she
was about to wed the man she loved.

WARSAW, Feb. 28.â The strike situ
ation in Poland is far from encourag
ing. A general strike of shop assist
ants in Warsaw is expected to-morrow
unless the demands of the men are
conceded. Seventy-live per cent of thÂ«
employers are willing to give in, but
the remainder refuse to do so. The do
mestic servants also threaten to strike
to-morrow.
The coal supply in Warsaw Is dimin
ishing and prices are rapidly advanc
ing, owing to the situation at Sos
ncvice. where few mines are being op
erated. Negotiations between the em
ployers and strikers are continuing, but
there is probably little hope of a suc
cessful outcome. All the coal received .
here now Is coming from Silesia. The
situation was further complicated to
day by a strike of the coal cart drivers.
The owners of the great cotton mills '
at Zyrardoff to-day notified 15.0J0
strikers that unless they returned to
work immediately the mills would be
closed for six months.
There is some evidence of a recru- /
descence of the Lodz strike. The strike, '

'"From Four to Six" Is Given
by the California Ladies
With Flattering Success
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
There was good fan at the California
Club yesterday when five hundred
members and guests listened and
laughed through a clever little skit
written by Mrs. Ella M. Sexton, and in
terpreted â doesn't that sound good?â
by a dozen wide-awake members.
Tho story deals with ethics and ac
cidents uf giving a tea at which a lot
of feminine mental attitudes are turn
ed inside out.
T'h<? following was the cast:
lime. litllairs. a great psyeopath, Mrs. A.
C. Kollogt;; I^.uise Hardy, a dreamer, who is
a pnpU ot Mine. Hollairs, Mrs. Will Maddern;
Mr.-. Ugbtwalte, who 1b giving the tea. Mrs.
James C. Crawl ord; Gladys Up-to-Date, Mrs.
George E. B.itrs; Mrs. Reno Swift, Mrs.
Aaron Schloss; Dulcle Peere, Miss Eleanor
Croudacf; Mrs. Fairmount, a personage, Mrs.
Horace Coffin; Mrs. Erly Pioneere, Mrs. J. W.
Orr; Miss Ko:-e Biddle-Budd, niece to Mrs.
Fairmount, Miss Bonnie Stockwell; Miss
Kn wital, a Fociety reporter. Miss Emily
Coe-y; Marie Kathleen, a French -Irish maid,
Mrs. Georee D. Gear.
To say which lady was the particular
etar would be rashly unwiseâ being a
clubmember. But it's not stretching
the truth lo say that they all were
clever.
And as for stage presence, the lead
ing ladies were marvels, Mrs. James C.
Crawford setting the pace for dignity
as hostess at the tea. Stagef right?
Not a bit.
Some mighty stunning gowns were
worn by the mummies, who, in spite
of their triumphs, descended from the
stage, and sipped tea with the "house."
Following the play Harry Mestayer
gave some interesting renditions of
Bliss Carmer's verses.
The next red-letter day will be cor
nerstone day, the 7th, when the much
discussed clubhouse will have been
launched upon its way.

CONGRESS EXPRESSES LACK
OF FAITH IN JIU-JITSU
Cuts Out Appropriation to Pay Salary
of Japanese Instructor for
Cadets.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27. â Congress
to-day expressed its lack of faith in
jiu-jitsu by striking out in the con
ference over the military academy ap
propriation bill the provision appro
priating an annual salary for an in
structor to teach that Japanese art to
cadets. The original item appropri
ated $4 500 for instructors in fencing,
broadsword and jiu-jitsu. The pro
vision was cut down to $3000, provid
ing for only two "instructors."
The manner in which members of
a West Point football squad cleaned
up a jiu-jitsu instructor recently was
discussed by the committee and
seemed to have considerable effect.
One of the conferees told of the in
structor having easily thrown a num
ber of cadets by his skill, but added
that the result of his encounter with
a member of the football squad had
put him in the hospital with a broken
shoulder. The conferees promptly cut
out the appropriation.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 28. â The Sen
ate Committee on Judiciary to-day, by
adopting the views of Senator Spooner
concerning recess nominations and
what constitutes a recess of the Sen
ate, has declared that there can be no
constructive recess. The decision, if
it were given any legal standing by
the action of the Senate, would af
fect the nominations of General
Leonard Wood, Dr. W. D. Crum, Col
lector of the Port of Charleston, S, C,
and 166 other nominations Bent to the
Senate in the infinitesimal period be
tween the adjournment of the special
session convened on November 9,
1903, and the convening of the regu
lar session on December 7, the two
sessions having merged. All the nom
inations were sent to the Senate later
and confirmed, but the officers drew
salaries for the time. The Senate
committee now decides they were not
serving under authority of law.

MINNESOTA HAS
CAT PROBLEM
Descendants of Fifty Domes
tic Tabbies Overrun the
State's Northern Forests
ALL LAEGE AND FIEECE
Kittens of New Tribe Are
Eeal Savages and Cause
the Settlers Grave Alarm
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 28.âDomes
tic cats running wild, and their de
scendants born in the timber, threat
en to overrun the forests of the north
ern part of this State.
Several years ago a lumber company
operating in St. Louis County distrib
uted about fifty cats among its camps
and at the headquarters for supplies
to kill off the rats which were doing
much damage. When the camps broke
up most of the cats were left to shift
for themselves and the result has
been that they are now running wild,
with their thousands of descendants,
and the feline population of the county
has already reached astonishing pro
portions.
To all intents and purposes the ani
mals have been transformed from do
mestic to wild cats. The kittens born
to the wild conditions are much larg
er, and fiercer than the old Dutch
mousers that bred them. As a rule
the kittens grow nearly a third larger
than the old tabbies and their fur is
longer and finer than that of cats
raised in domesticity. The animals are
more active and better conditioned.
Their color is changing from the varie
gated colors of the domestic cats to
gray and dun of the native wild cat.
Farmers report that they are inter
breeding with the wild species and are
frequently seen associating with their
larger brother, the lynx.
The new race of wild cats has no
difficulty in making a good living in
Lake County, which abounds in rab
bits, wild mice and birds. With the
instinct of the feline race the cats
have their regular lairs for protection
from wolves and cold and for raising
their litters. A lynx or a regular wild
cat will no\; harm one of them, recog
nizing them as members of the same
family.
The question what is to be done with
this new tribe of wild cats is already
puzzling the community. They are not
big and savage enough to be a men
ace to anything the settler raises, ex
cept possibly the "poultry, and they
may prefer rabbits. A Duluth timber
cruiser says that within five years the
Legislature will be offering a bounty
for the destruction of the descendants
of the staid old mousers that were
taken from their happy city homes to
exterminate rats in Lake County.
SELLS HALF INTEREST
IN GIRL FOR $135
Chinese Traffic in Human Chattels
Exposed in Trial of Peonage
Case at Honolulu.
HONOLULU, Feb. 22. â Two docu
ments of a startling character were in
troduced at the preliminary investiga
tion of Chong Chung Yuen, charged
with peonage before Commissioner
Judd. One was a bill of sale from
Wong Loy to Lav Wai Kong, convey
ing for $135 a half interest in a girl
named Choy Ying, 12 or 14 years of
age, the buyer and seller having pre
viously claimed ownership of the girl
as partners. The next paper in the
case sets forth the -payment to Lav
Wai Kor" of $190 for payment of
"boarding and expenses" of the girl by
Chong Chung Yuen and the delivery
to him of the girl "for his control."
The vendor makes these covenants:
"If death or anything else should
be her fate, no one shall be blamed.
"If title to the said girl be not clear,
I warrant and defend said title by my
self."

NEW YORK. Feb. 28. â In a recent
suit brought by Maria Frandsca
O'Reilly, the Countess of Buena Vista,
Cuba, against Major-General John E.
Brooke, U. S. A., for $260,000 damages
for having while Governor-General of
Cuba, deprived her of the hereditary
right to slaughter all cattle for the
City of Havana, Judge Holt, in the
United States District Court to-day
overruled a demurrer filed by Charles
W. Russell, as special assistant At
torney-General, representing General
Brooke. Judge Holt, in overruling
the demurrer, said that the act of
General Brooke, "waa a confiscation
of the plaintiff's property and was
wholly unlawful, torturous and un
authorized on the part of the de
fendant and that it was in contraven
tion of the Spanish laws of 1759, and
of the subsequent decree of the Span
ish Crown in 1878." and in violation
of the treaty of peace with Spain.
Judge Holt refused to rule that Gen
eral Brooke was not personally liable.
ON TRAIL OF ALL TRUSTS.
Kansas Legislature Goes After Twine
and Insurance Men.
TOPEKA, Kans., Feb. 28. â The
anti-discrimination bill was a special
order in the House to-day, but wa3
not reached on account of time being
taken up with a discussion of the pri
mary election law. It probably will
be reached to-morrow. There is a
growing conviction that the anti-dis
crimination bill will not be passed by
the House. A week ago the House
leaders refused to assure passage of
the measure because the Senate would
not accept the House railroad bill.
The House passed a resolution to
day providing for an investigation of
the binding twine combine and the
Senate decided to look into the work
ings of the insurance companies do
ing business in this State. It is al
leged that the companies have made
a combine in violation of the State
anti-trust law.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Feb. 22.â Johnston Isl
and, a small isle about 600 miles south
â west of Honolulu. Is the destination of
the 6teamer Iwalani, with Messrs. Un
derwood and Brown, who chartered the
vessel from the Interisland Steam Nav
igation Company for a trip under
â¢'6Â«aled orders." They go to Johnston
Island for the purpose of investigating
the guano beds of that place.
Underwood and Brown have secured
authority from the State Department
to exploit the guano deposits of John-
Kor. Island. and will make preliminary
f urveyE. They took with them a quan
tity of tins and several testing r^ds.
The tins **ill be utilized as receptacles
of tlie samples of jruano, and the rods
will be used to determine the depth of
the deposits. The present trip is en
tirely preliminary In character, as the
explorers would ascertain the extent of
the guano deposits on Johnston Island
before Investing the capital necessary
to exploit the fields.
The details cf the trip were made
known to Captain Hamlet of the reve
nue cutter Bear. Collector Stackable
notified Captain Hamlet of various ru
mors concerning the trip and request
ed Captain Hamlet to ascertain from
the leaders of the expedition its nature.
Jchnston Island was annexed \n the
Hawaiian group about ISâ¬2. About
thirty-five years ago the late Sam Al
lan and some other local capitalists
sent a schooner to Johnston Island for
the purpose of working the guano beds
of that island. A wharf and several
lighters were constructed. Pome of the
alluvial (ruano -was taken off, but the
â¢tuff wot found to be of such low grade
that it was considered unprofitable.
In 1889 a whaling vessel was wrecked
on Johnston Island. Larson, who is
employed here at the Marine Railway,
was a cooper aboard the vessel at the
time. Valuable supplies for trading
were on the whaling craft, and most
of them were landed by the crews.
Borne boats and other parts of the
wrecked craft were landed. Subse
quently the crowd was picked up by
another vhaler and brought to Oahu,
being placed aboard the old steamer
Kaala off Barbers Point and brought to
Honolulu by that steamer.
In 1892 a British man-of-war went
from here to Johnston Island and for
mally annexed it to the British em
pire. The proclamation of euch an
nexation was officially published in the
Honolulu newspapers by the command
er of the vessel. Apparently nothing
has been done with the island by local
people, although it is understood that
the American Guano Company worked
the guano beds of the Island some yearn
a^o.

VERY FEW PEOPLE
Are Free From Some Form of In- i
digestion.
Very few people are free from some
form of indigestion, but scarcely two
will have the same symptoms.
Some suffer most directly after eat-
ing, bloating: from gas in stomach and '
bowels, others have heartburn or sour j
risings, still others have palpitation of j
heart, headaches, sleeplessness, pains
In chest and under shoulder blades,
some have extreme nervousness, as In
nervous dyspepsia. i
But whatever the symptoms may be, ;
the caus.? in ail "cases of Indigestion Is i
the same, .hat is the stomach for some i
reason fails to properly and promptly
digest what is eaten.
This Is the whole story of stomach
troubles in a nutshelL The stomach
must have rest and assistance and
Stuarfs Dyepepeia Tablets give It both I
by supplying those natural digestives
which every weak stomach lacks, ow-
ing to the failure of the peptic glands
in the stomach to secret sufficient acid I
and pepsin to thoroughly digest and â¢
essimilate the food eaten.
One grain of the active principle in
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest
3000 grains of meat, eggs or other
wholesome food, and this claim has
been proven by actual experiment,
which any one can perform for himself
in the following manner: Cut a hard-
boiled egg Into very small pieces, as it j
â would be If masticated; place the egg j
and two or three of the tablets in a
bottle or Jar containing warm water I
heated to 98 degrees (the temperature
of the body) and keep It at this tem-
perature for three and one-half hours,
at the end of which time the egg.wiH 'â â 
\>f. as completely digested as It would
have been in the healthy stomach of a
hungry boy.
The point of this experiment is that
what Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will
do to the egg in the bottle they will
do to the egg or meat in ihe stomach
and nothing else will rest and invigor-
ate the stomach bo safely and effec-
tually. Even a little child can take
Ptuarfs-Tablets with safety and benefit
if its digestion is weak, and the thou-
sands of cures accomplished by their
regular daily use are easily explained
when it is understood that they are
composed of vegetable essences, asep- i
tic, pepsin, 'diastase and Golden Seal,
which .mingle with the food and digest
It thoroughly, giving the overworked
stomach a chance to recuperate.
Dieting never cures Dyspepsia,
neither do pills and cathartic medi-
cines, which simply Irritate and in-
flame the Intestines.
When enough food Is eaten and
promptly digested there will be no
constipation, nor in fact will there be
disease of any kind because good di-
gestion means good health in every
organ. . .
The merit and success of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets are world-wide and
they are sold at the r moderate price of
50 cents for full-sized package in
every drug store In the United States
and Canada* as well as in Eurone.

searched her baggage there was at first
glance nothing beyond the declared
There were bags presumed to be
filled with soiled linen. On the top
were numerous pieces of unwashed
garments; but beneath, this dirty ex
terior the inspectors discovered the
smuggled stuff. In Mrs. Jacobson's
trunks were found stockings tied into
knots and carelessly tossed or stuffed
into corners, and when the knots were
unbound the interior of the stockings
were found filled with laces. Pillows
were also stuffed with valuable fabrics.
WhÂ«n Mrs. Jaccbson's attention was
called to the matter she at first stated
that the trunks had been packed for
her by other persons. Then she said
she had bought them in Japan and had
landed them in Manila, at first intend
ing to stay there, but she changed her
mind and continued the voyage on the
Siberia.
The foreign value of the goods was
probably about $350. The duty added,
the value was about $550. The law
provides the penalty for smuggling
shall be treble the appraised value,

JT'DGE REVOKES 6KNTEXCE
IN CASE OF SYLVESTER
SevÂ©nteen-Ye*r-Old Boy Will Not
Have to Berve Term in San
Quentin.
It is seldom that a Judge re
verses hlmÃelf to the extent of revok
ing sentence passed upon a criminal
and imposing a less severe penalty,
but this almost unprecedented action
was taken by United States District
Judge de Haven yesterday in the case
of Frank Sylvester, who on the previ
ous day had been sentenced to impris
onment in the penitentiary at San
Quentin at hard labor for six months
lor having stolen a 80-cent handker
chief from the top of a rural delivery
box at San Lorenzo. Sylvester is only
17 years old. Not having any counsel,
he * pieaded guilty upon the indict
ment.
On Monday afternoon after the
Judge had reached home he was in
formed of the facts in the case and
realized that he had Imposed a severe
sentence.
Just before sentence was pro
nounced Assistant United States At
torney Ben L. McKinley stated to the
court that the Government would be
satisfied with a light punishment, but
he failed to mention the fact that the
prisoner was a boy of only 17 years
and that the article stolen was valued
at but 50 cents.
Yesterday morning the Judge sent
for Mr. McKinley and asked for the
salient points of the case. Then the
Judge sent for the boy, revoked the
former sentence and resentenced him
for the same period of time to the
Alameda County Jail instead of to the
State prison.

YEARNED-FOR RESULT.
HOLDER OF CHARM TAXES
VOODOO MAN WITH FRAUD
Skepticism Supplants Faith
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Miss Lulu Alexander, of willowy fig
ure and sable complexion, Informed
Police Judge Mogan that her faith in
the genuineness of voodooism was se
verely shaken, if not irreparably shat
tered, hy the manner in which she had
been treated by one of its professors,
Quon Rafael by name, whom she spe
flcally accused of having disturbed the
peace of her abode in Pinckney place.
Until her experience with Professor
Quori, she averred, none was less skep
tical of Ethiopian mysticism than she,
but now shÂ« waÂ» wallowing: deeply in
the trough of doubt. Indeed she was
rather inclined to regard the entire
fabric of African superstition aÂ» a de
lusion, not to say a snare.
When the defendant visited her and
declared she was afflicted with unre- 1
requited love Miss Alexander said he i
won her confidence, because he told ;
the truth. She would not deny that j
for months her heart had been In the
keeping of a dusky gentleman whose
physical grace, fistic prowess and in
tellectual charm had made him the
coveted of many females of his race.
He was unconscious of her adoration
and she had never told a living soul
â not even her closest confidante. Miss j
jLnaÂ£Â£ati& 'Jtomsdif. of whom the court j
might have heard â that she had "a |
feelin' " for any particular member of j
the opposite sex. Therefore when the j
voodoo man said she was sick at soul
and diagnosed the ailment she knew
that he was not prompted by hearsay,
and when he offered to quickly bring to
her feet the one for whom she pined a
bargain was struck on the spot.
"He gey me a lodestcne," Miss Alex
ander continued, "en ah gey him a
dollah fo' a stahtah. He sez, 'To' hole
dls yah chahm In yo' nan,* he sez,
'en yo' wish fo' dat yah man teh lub

he's a dreamin' ob you. Bn yo' might

retiahed fo' de night ah kep' de stone
pressed teh mah heaht."
Nothing but disappointment reward
led Miss Alexanders experiment with
the etone and when she accused the
magician of fraud and demanded the
return of her investment he created
such a disturbance that she was com
pelled to summon police aid. She in-
I cidentally averred that he attempted to
i steal her purse, but that part of the
i testimony was stricken out as irrele
j vant and several other things.
Mr. Rafael, whose hair was bushy,
opined that if Miss Alexander had
' given his lodestone full and fair op
i portunity to exercise its charm she
| would have had no ground for com-
I plaint. He had explicitly instructed
i her to place the stone under her pil
j.low, but that she neglected to do, thus
! leaving the object of her tender de
; sire perfectly free to dream of some
i other person or not to dream at all,
whereas if she had done as she was
told he could not possibly have
j dreamed of any one else than herself.
After the lodestone had been exam
' ined by the court â it looked like a frag
; ment of Telegraph Hillâ the defend
1 ant was pronounced guilty and re
| manded for sentence.
Ous Scobie and Henry McCarthy
were accused of breaking into the
stable attached to J. J. Linehan's gro
cery at Twenty- fifth and Bryant
streets, and stealing therefrom a set
of harness, with which they rode
away in a wagon, which was taken
without Its owner's permission. Pa
trolmen Graham and Harrison ar
rested them, and Judge Conlan' con
tinued their case till to-morrow.

fected an entrance at 4 o'clock yes
terday morning by. smashing a plate
glass panel of the front door. Pa
trolmen Tillman -and Heinrich caught
him behind the counter, where he was
busily engaged in Btowing his plun
der, and Judge Cabaniss sent him to
the Superior Court for trial, with bail
fixed at $3000. Smith is a young fel
low and apparently a novice in bur
glary.
Oliver Sands, charged with having
attempted to murder Max Dunow,
failed to appear In Judge Fritz's court
when the case was called, and the
$1000 cash bail which he had de
posited was ordered forfeited.
Han You, accused of practicing
medicine without a license, must un
dergo another trial before Judge Mo
the evidence failed to agree and was
dismissed. The principal prosecuting
witness was Mrs. Anderson, who
swore that Han Lou felt her pulse
and then sold to her some herbs, but
Han You adroitly averred that the
pulse-feeling did not convict hun of
having made r physical examination,
but was performed simply and solely
to enable him to determine the qual

Alexander Schwartz, who was re
cently dismissed by Judge Mogan for
lack of evidence sufficient to con
vict him of having kept a place
where dools were sold, was rearrested
on a similar charge, and is now on
Judge Conlan's calendar. Schwartz
keeps a notion and stationery store

was first raided about half a dozen
housewives were arrested for betting.

Eleventh street, last Monday after
noon, smashed the telephone and as
saulted Asplund when hfl rrvrion

trio that has been arrested, and Judge
Cabaniss has continued his case until
the police have captured his cfom

men struck him a severe blow on his
right arm with a short piece of iron

Detective Mathewson said he had

rifling against Edward Williams, an
ex-convict, but had entered only one
of them, holding the others in reserve
for utilization in the event of that one

he, although conversant with several

Mr. Czerkl's lingo as beyond his ken.
Then the Japanese Interpreter was

Thomas Noonan, who was registered

would be more manly on his part If
he were to contribute to defrayal of

"I will sentence him to-morrow,"
said the Judge to the wife, "and the
severity of the sentence rests entirely

"I don't care how severe you make
It," was the response.
"So you say to-day," quoth the wise

DECLARES KNAPP
WAS INSULTING
Wife of Civilian Employe of
Navy Will Prefer Charges
Against Officer of Solace
SOCIALLY OSTEACIZED
Woman Says Transport's Ex
ecutive Caused Her Hu
miliation During Voyage
Lieutenant Commander J. J. Knapp
is executive officer of the navy trans
port Solace. Mrs. J. M. Costello, a
motherly looking matron, who was a
passenger on the Solaoe from Cavite
on the voyage which ended yesterday,
seys that Lieutenant Commander J. J.
Knapp repeatedly insulted and humil
iated her during the trip. She intends,
she says, to lay her grievance before
the Secretary of the Navy in order
that other wives of plain, ordinary civ
ilians, whom circumstances may com
pel to travel on a navy transport, may
do so without undergoing the mental
torture to which the actions of Lieu
tenant Commander Knapp subjected
her.
Mrs. Costello* who was accompanied
by her small boy, is the wife of a civ
ilian employe of the navy. Her hus
band is foreman of the boiler making
department at the Cavite Navy Yard,
a skilled mechanic and as good an
American, says Mrs. Costello, as Lieu
tenant Commander J. J. Knapp. Mrs.
Costello has been visiting her husbana
at his station in the Far East. When
she got ready to return to this country
she was provided with first-class trans
portation for herself and son on the
navy transport Solace.
The Solace Is a passenger boat and
as Mrs. Costello had a first-class ticket
she concluded that she would be al
lowed to walk the deck with the other
first-class passengers.
Lieutenant Commander Knapp said
no, however, and as what th* executive
officer says on board ship goes,
Knapp'B "no" went and therein lies
Mrs. Costello's grievance.
She was forbidden, she says, to sit
or walk on the starboard side of the
promenade deck. Every other woman
passenger had the freedom of the ship,
but by Knapp's orders Mrs, Costello
was compelled to take promenades or
Bun baths on the port side or at the
extreme after end on the starboard
Bide. She protested, she says, to Com
mander Bull, but he did nothing, she
declares, to lift or ease the social ban
under which Knapp's orders placed
her.
"Ha told me that that part of the
deck was reserved for the officers and
their friends. He spoke to me as no
man ever did before and as he would
not have dared to do had not I been
a lone woman and he in a position of
absolute authority. I did not care es
pecially for that particular part of the
deck, but it was humiliating to me as
a woman and as an American to be
barred from crossing an Imaginary line
because my social standing did not
come up to Mr. Knapp's standard.
The other women went where they
pleased. I felt like a leper. Even my
little boy saw that the other people
thought there was something wrong
about his mother. He's a little chap,
but he noticed it and that hurt my
pride more than anything else. Other
wives of civilians who are not in so
ciety will have occasion to travel on
the Solace and I am going to do what
I can to save them from the bitter
experience that has been mine on this
ship. I intend to prefer charges
against Mr. Knapp with the Secretary
of the Nan."
Lieutenant Commander Knapp
acknowledged that Mrs. Costello had
stated the truth, but said that she
had tried to force her acquaintance on
other passengers and that he had
drawn the social dead-line to save
these others from being annoyed by a
woman who was socially Impossible.
"And. my dear sir," said the gal
lant officer In conclusion. "If there was
a little more of this kind of discrimi
nation on the regular liners, travel
would be freed of one of Its greatest
annoyances."

House Where Bride Lives
Special Dispatch to Tha CalL
CHICAGO. Ills., Feb. 28.â While a j
cordon of policemen surrounded thÂ«
mansion at 4319 Drexel boulevard, and
detectives in dress suits hovered be- ;
hind the waiting bridesmaids, Miss i
Mary Louise Blair stood at the bedside
of Sidney O. Blair, her father, in thÂ« i
Streeter Hospital and Bishop Cheney
privately said the words that made her :
the- wife of Russell Sly Burke of New
York City.
The marriage took place in defiance ;
of a chain of blackmailing letters
which are said to have threatened to !
biow up the bride's home and expose '
facts that might prevent the wedding.
The marrige took place in the hospi
tal at 6 o'clock. An hour and a half -
later Mr. and Mrs. Burke were hurried !
into the house where the wedding par- ; <
ty was waiting, and by a rear stairway , i
reached the third floor, where the â 
bridesmaids, groomsmen and the de- '
tectives were waiting. In exactly the
order In which Episcopal communi- i
canta leave the chancel at a wedding
the party marched down stairs to meet 'â 
the guests.
The newly wedded couple Boon after
boarded a train for Palm Beach. Fla. |
Their departure was the climax of a .
day that had set South Side society â  ,
and the Hyde Park police in a nutter I .
of interest and excitement. At least ,
two mysterious letters are known to
have been received by the bride. These
letters are said to have demanded $5000
and declared that if it was not paid
the Blair mansion wo aid be blown up
by dynamite.
Descriptions given of the letters are
very vague, and were elicited from
officials only after the most vigorous
cross -questioning.

MAKES A HIT

I^izet's peal "Carnien*' I
â  V GOOD WOBK I
â¦
If tlie Company Continues ;|
to Improve the Tivnli
3lnst See to Its Laurels'*
Mr. Savage's methods of business
avoid shovdns the best good? first.
Last night's "Carmen" was as different
in lift, swing, spirit from Monday's
"Othello" as can be imagined. It is
true that "Othello" was an unfortunate
opera for a debut performance; that
for its Interpretation Is required in
tensity, subtlety and distinction of the
highest degree; but in its rendering
there vras lacking â wholly what was so
abundantly in evidence last night
among its chief Interpreters tempera- â 
ment. Individuality. If this evening's |
"â Lohengrin" increases la value at the ;
came ratio, the Tlvoli folk will have to
look to their laurels.
Marion Ivell was the Carmen. One
has heard among other things that a \
few weeks ago New Orleans would not
have Miss I veil's Carmen. Possibly the
passionate press agent's label of Miss
Ivell as the "American Calve" had
6omething 10 do with it. Possibly the :
fact that Miss Ivell and the Savage !
people came from New York, that :
â¢would have none of M.. Charles and his
JCew Orleans French opera company,
had something to do with it.
One has to seek reasons for a musi
cal folk not liking the Savage produc
tion of "Carmen" as one got it last .
tight at the Columbia, from Miss Ivell's
Carmen down to the smokeless â I j
mean â waterfall of the third
act. :. 'â â ,â¢
Zelie de L.ussan'6 Carmen It has i
been the fashion to call "sultry" â
though to some of us it was of a mild
end amiable tepidity. But if Miss de
L-ussan's Carmen were "sultry" Miss
Ivell's is sulphurous. Carmens in their
â cores have com? and gone here; for
chief, Calve'B and Collamarini's. With
these any other Carmen is Inevitably
compared. Much more, then, know-
Ing both, one would class Miss Ivell
as the American Collamarini. She is
not, most probably, so old a Carmen
tr- Callamarinl; she lacks something
of the insolent, animal repose as of
the tiger sure of his â that Colla
marini's Carmen possessed; she has
i.ot the fascinating vocal beauty â nor
the vocal tricks Collamarini; but
the conception is in identically the
E.ime key. It Is even more sinuous
and more tigerish, even more the vain,
jsssionate, liberty loving gypsy of
Merimee.
Miss Ivell's looks go a long: way.
Fine, long, brilliant eyes, a full sensu
ous mouth, shining black hair clev- '
erly smoothed over the brow, and a
supple, handsome figure make her
Carmen one of admirable physical il
lusion. She is further graceful to a
degree and costumed in excellently
picturesque and characteristic fash
ion. Nor Is there anything the matter
with Miss Ivell's voice â much
with here she keeps it.
It is placed much too far back, get
ting even nasal in its fiber occasionally, j
But if the voice is eminently sufficient, i
round, large and warmly contralto in
quality, and the singer uses it
otherwise with exceptional intelligence
and sympathy. She has yet to learn
to sacrifice some detail for the sake of
climax in the matter of acting, a not
able instance of anti-climax being at 1
the end of the third act â the Don Jose i
bting equal criminal with her â the j
second attack by Don Jose losing its
force by the too much' accent laid by \
both sinsrers on the first But the per
formance as a v.'hole is one of distin- \
guished intelligence and close tem
peramental sympathy, and should not
be missed.
In the Don Jose one was very pleased
to welcome again the clever Cassio of
the evening before, Mr. Reginald
Koberts. "Awfully" well Mr. Roberts
eings, in a bright, robust, manly and j
sympathetic fashion. I didn't like his j
magenta trews, but with the careful
correctness of the other detail they
were probably all right, but Mr. Rob- !
crts' Don Jose stands honorably with \
all but the best that I have heard.
Particularly on the pathetic side the
conception rings true; and it was im
passioned though failing a little in 'â 
power in the last act; but as to the i
originality of the torn and soiled shirt j
âthe unbraced garb of Orlando â of that
act there is no question of brilliant
novelty!
Good again was the Escamillo,
Arthur Deane, robust in voice and act
ing and with an admirable measure of
the braggadocio bearing of the torea
dor. Kis "Toreador Song" was artisti
cally and picturesquely sung and
elicited a hearty encore. A charming
Micaela was Miss Jean Lane Brooks,
a near neighbor of ours as neighbors
po here, a Denver girl. Miss Brooks
has an excellently trained soprano and
tings with sympathy and taste. A
Zuntga that counted was done by
Francis J. Boyle, and A. H. Busby and
Stephen Junjrman were - "1 as the

Long Service of Maine Senators.
Senator Hale now has the banner
record of all Senators ever elected from
Maine, in having been chosen for five
full terms of six years each. The Maine
Legislature at Augusta a few days ago
gave him a re-election by acclamation,
and many pleasant things were said
about his public service at the national
capital.
Hannibal Hamlin, Vice President
during Lincoln's first term, was Mr.
Hale's immediate predecessor. He, too,
was elected to the Senate for five
terms, but they were not all complete
terms of six years each, nor were they
in succession, as Mr. Hale's have been.
Before the Civil War Mr. Hamlin had
three terms in the Senate as a Demo
crat; one of four years, another, im
mediately following, of almost six
years, and soon afterward another
term of about four years. Mr. Ham
lin then had two terms as Senator some
years after he had ceased to be the
Republican Vice President, and de
clined a third consecutive term, where
upon Mr. Hale succeeded him in 1881.

China's Coal Fields.
China's lesources of c >al i-nrl iron
are among the largest and most favor
ably situated In the world. The t;x-
Usnt of the great coal fields nas been
put dt 400,000 square miles- twice the
area of France and more than seven
ty times the aggregate extent of all
the coal fields of Britain. Of the qual
ity of the deposits much has ye 1 ; to be
learned, but the distinguished Ger
man geologist. Baron yon Richtofen, re
ported many years ago that both the
anthracite and the bituminous varie
ties were equal to the best produced
in Europe. It Is expected that very
soon Chinese coal will be delivered
at Far Eastern ports at prices with
which no other coal can possibly com
pete, and that China, in consequence
of this development, will become a
large exporter of iron. â Engineering.
A "Scalawag:" Defined.
According to the Hartford Courant,
a "scalawag" in Connecticut means a
person who favors a secret ballot for
United States Senator, In order that
"fixed" votes may possibly dodge the
fixing contract. By the same token
they must be scalawags who favor a
secret ballot in popular elections; for
does not the secret ballot greatly hin
der the vote fixer in securing the de
livery of the goods? Is it not as de
sirable that promises, pledges, con
tracts, etc., in regard to how any one
shall vote at the polls, be made se
cure through an open popular ballot,
as in this case of electing a United

CIRCUS HAS ARRIVED
AND SMALL BOY IS GLAD
Transfer of Xorrls & Rowe's Show
From Depot to Pavilion Affords
Excitement.
The vicinity of Third and Townsend
streets was a scene of excitement for
the small boy yesterday. The occasion
was the arrival of the Norris & Rowe
circus from winter quarters at San
Jose. The circus comes ahead of time,
for it will open the spring, tour in this
city and will have several rehearsals
before the first public performance next
Saturday afternoon.
As the elephants were being unloaded
at the depot several horses were start
led at the unusual sight and made a
break for liberty. Upon their arrival
at Mechanics' Pavilion Hero, the larg
est of the pachyderms, went through
the flooring and it took the combined
efforts of the other elephants to drag
him to terra flrma.
To add to the excitement Captain
Debro and his miniature wife went
for a stroll down Market street, with
the result that they soon blockaded
the thoroughfare and it took a squad
of nolicemen to escort the little folks
back to the Pavilion. Captain Debro
and his spouse are midget Eskimos,
brought to this country from the icy
zone of the north.
Mechanics' Pavilion is being fitted
with bunting flags and stream
ers to give it the proper festive ap
pearance for the circus engagement.
The big in-door show Is always a
popular one here, and as it brings
many new features, especially in the
way of bareback riding acts, they will
no doubt have the usual crowded at
tendance.
Seats will be placed on sale Thurs
day morning at the Pavilion box of
fice, and there will be a grand illumi
nated street parade Friday night.

exploded. How a catastrophe was
averted is a mystery that cannot be
explained. No one was injured in the

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
PLANS TO CURE
ILLS OF LABOR
George W. Dickie Advances
Scheme Which He Thinks
Will Solve the Problem
ADDBESS AT UNIVERSITY
Union Iron Works Man Tells
Students of Device Calcu
lated to Benefit All
Berkeley Office San Franc i?- Call,
2148 Center Street, Feb. 23.
Unusual interest was taken at the
Coilege of Commerce last night in the
address of George: W. Dickie on the
"Labor Problem"^ delivered before the
students ol the college, oecause or tne
prominent part Mr. Dickie has taken
Id the past few years in matters af
fecting labor questions. Incidentally
the fame of Mr. Dickie as the man who
supervised the building of the battle
ship Oregon at the Union Iron Works
in San Francisco, with which latter
Institution he is now connected as
manager, lent additional interest 10 his
words.
Mr. Dickie spoke, without mincing
\rords, upon thÂ» points where the in
terests of labor and capital conflict,
and after describing the friction that
he said exists between the two classes,
declared that the only solution of. the
difficulty apparent to him is the
simple plan of paying men for their
work according to the amount ac
complished Instead of for the time
â¢pent in doing such work. Mr. Dickie
in this connection described a plan for
paying labor, which he considers the
only one yet conceived that is practi
cable and equitable. He said: .~
Many of you whom I now address will live.
1 confldeiJtly believe, to see this question with
which industry and capital - now face to face,
Casily settled. The whole- problem 1* con
cerned with two factors -time and money. The
employer wants to plve little^ money and get
much time; the employe strives to pet much
money and give little time. Constant and in
evitable friction is the consequence in the
â¢world of labor and capital. The difficulty xp
caused by the fact that men are paid for their
time Instead of the work they actually do.
As the result of long experience and much
thought I have arrived st the conclusion <hat
the only settlement of the -question, just to
all parties. Is to pay men for what they do â
nnt for Th* time they take to flo it in. The
piecework system partly carries out this Idea,
but It has faults. *" .'â 
My plan is to separate the item of labor
cost from the other costs in making estimates
en a contract. ThÂ»>n let the workmen of all
departments involved sign an agreement
through their representatives to perform the
â¢work at a price of their own fixing. If a
surplus on this estimate remains alter pay
ment of usual wajcf-s, let it be credited .to the
surplus labor fund. Then let â¢ dividend be
Cellared every six months.
This plan has already kx-en tried in one or
two departments of a great dry goods store
e.n<! a dividend of $1200 to the men was paid
last month. From every point of view the
plan seems practical. Besides, It has the
crowning mrrit of equity, which no other so
lution of the labor problem seem* to have.

Little Family Returns From
Visit and Finds That the
Home Has Been Deserted
Oakland Office Pan Franupco Call,
1016 Broadwfty, Feb. 28.
Under . circumstances that have
clouded his disappearance in mystery,
George Bennett, a Contra Costa laun
dry company employe, has dropped out
of sight, leaving his wife and a baby
at their home, 1641 Market street, with
out a clew to his whereabouts. Ben
nett's disappearance was reported to
the police of Oakland and of San Fran
cisco. Detectives have been unable to
trace c the movements of the missing
husband since February 18, the day he
left Mrs. Bennett while she was visit
ing In San Francisco.
The mother had < rossed the bay to
stay with friends for a day. But the
became ill and she decided to
in over night. Bennett met her,
but said he would return home to Oak
land that he might go to work on time
the next morning.
When Mrs. Bennett arrived at her
residence the fnllowinp day she found
no sign of her husband except a DOte
which announced he had been called
1 .lose, but would return the next
day. Not a word has been heard from
him since 'hen. The distracted wife
declares she cannot explain her hus
band's silence. She fears accident or
worse has befallen him. Shortly be
fore Bennett departed he drew two

The aim of the association is practical en
couragement of art arid its trend is the estab

an end much to be desired and that should
easily find ' support in a town that ha* been
called the Athens of the Pacific.
The exhibition, which begins. March 4 and
closes Mar 11. will, as usual, include oils,
water eolerp, pastels, black and white, minia
tures, photographs and sculpture, and as the
jury i- at a very high standard the public may
expect utiasuaJ excellence in the display, over
two hundred exhibits having- been accepted." '"
Among the leading artists whose work will

The exquisite art of David Bispham was
never more .apparent than at the Home Club
last Saturday right, when, suffering from a
grievous cold, he gave every number but otic
of a trying programme in a fashion that filled
bia hearft> with delight. Mr. Bispham is un
doubtedly one of the greatest artists on the
fctage to-day. His cinglng is not a mere per
fect muscular conrtol of the vocal chords, but
a strong, manly Intelligence porvades every
note, and above all soars a warm, magnetic
individuality. It is not flattering to the mu
sical taste and appreciation of Oaklanders to
say ihat less than 100 people took advantage
of thÂ« opportunity (riven by the Home Club to
bear Mr. Biephaip Saturday evening, but such
was the o.asf. Th* Hime Club has been work-
Ing m the theory that an artist is JuÂ«t a*
much of an artist on this side of the bay as
in San Francisco, and that lovers of music in
Oakland would encourage any arrangement that
would cave one the inconvenient and tiresome
trip across the bay. But the optimism of its
members has r*eeived a sad blow â a series of
thtm. In fact, for I hf-ar they have lost money
on nearly every concert and now there Is talk
of discontinuing the costly experiment.
U It is ... really : incomprehensible : that musical

â â âI. . â  # â !â â 
NEW FORM OF YELLOW PERIL '
) THAT COMES WITH BAYONETS
OAKLAND, Feb. 28.â Cadets for the
reorganized army of China are being
drilled regularly In Oakland, and in
this city the nucleus of an army ia be
ing formed. There are, all told, some
forty-live â oKteliy young Celestials,
and they hav e as their drill master, R.
J. Fsntuf, a former member of the
Tenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, who
saw duty in the Philippines.
Captain Faneuf has his men work
ing twice a week, and he is putting
them through the most severe form of
military di ill and exercise. He has
already brought them up to a high
stace of efficiency in military tactics.
All of the non-commissioned officers
of the company are Chinese appointed
ljy Captain Faneuf in accordance with
tne rules and regulations of the I'nited
Btatea army. The drill tactics are the
Sii me as those of the United States
army and in every respect the organi
zation and instruction is the same as
the latest form of United States mili
tary practice.
The organization is the outcome of
a movement that was started in Cali
fornia some year or two ago by the
Chinese empire. The Chinese recog
nize the value of European ana Ameri
can education for their people and
know that if China is ever to take a
plHce as a world power she must
follow the lead of Japan and put her
people, md particularly her army, up
on thp same basis as that of the pow
ers* of the earth.
In several different places in the
United States bodies of young Chinese
are being drilled in military tactics,
and these are being sent to China a few
at a time to carry the work on in the
empire itself. As the young students
Of mi'itary science increase in num
bers and become proficient they are
sent back home to take places in the
Imperial Chinese army.

ALAMEDA, Feb. 28. â Two hundred and
forty-six vote* were cast here to-day at the
municipal primary election, which was the
quietest held In the history of the city. There
was no opposition to the forty-five Republican
delegates offered by that party to nominate
three candidates for City Trustees and thrrf
candidates for the Board of Education to be
voted for at the city election in April,
geles, which is the headquarters of the
general movement upon this coast.
There Homer Lee, formerly connected
with the United States army, is the
general organizer. There is also a
, company in San Francisco, though this
company is Independent and not un
der the control of Lee, yet it has for
its object the same result.
The San Francisco company is un
der the command of "General" Falken
berg, formerly a sergeant of Troop A
of the National Guards. Falkenberg
claims the title of "general."
When the Chinese began the work
of teaching the young Chinese the
idea how to shoot they enlisted the in
terest of Homer Lee, and Lee imme
diately turned to the young Philippine
veterans, who still had a fondness for
"soldiering." Some months ago he sent
a communication to the various camps
of Spanish-American War veterans and
invited those who wished to undertake
this work to communicate with him.
Hints of this reached the public at the
time, but the full significance has but
now leaked out, since the actual work
has begun.
The work is general throughout the
country, but the exact extent is un
known, for the Chinese managers are
absolutely uncommunicative, and the
American officers of the different com
panies are silent as the Chinese them
selves.
Captain Faneuf of the Oakland com
pany pleaded to-night that he had
nothing to say, because he knew noth
ing.
"All that I know," said Faneuf, "is
that I am drilling a number of young
Chinese in military tactics. I do not
know why they are drilling or any
thing about the object. The story of
the appeal to the camps of the Span
ish-American War veterans was pub
lished at the time, and I knew noth
ing about that until after it got Into
the papers."
ASKS ARREST
OF A WITNESS
Attorney for Hibernia Bank
Says Crime Was Done
in Order to Draw Money
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 28.
Attorney F. S. Britain, representing
the Hibernia Savings Bank of San
Francisco, asks that James F. O'Han
lon be placed under arrest. This was
an unexpected sensation in the con
test over the will of the late Elizabeth
O'Hanlon of Berkeley this afternoon.
Judge Ogden stated that the crime, if
one had been committed, had been done
in San Francisco and that any charge
that might be made would have to be
made there.
Elizabeth O'Hanlon died in January.
1904, leaving an estate valued at about
$I^,ooo. On February 6 O'Hanlon pre
sented a bankbook belonging to her
at the Hibernia Bank and drew out
$1100 upon an assignment of the book
to him upon the regular bank form
pasted in the back of the book. The
name of James O'Hanlon and that of
Elizabeth O'Hanlon were written in
the game handwriting, and when
Judge Ogden compared the signatures
with specimens of O'Hanlon's writing
he said that they had both been writ
ten by O'Hanlon. Attorney Brittain
then made the request to have him
(O'Hanlon) arrested. O'Hanlon also
testified that he did not know the as
signment was in the book or how it
got there. The accused is a clothing
merchant at 710 Montgomery street,
San Francisco, and has been charged
by his niece, Mary Breen, with trying
to grab the entire estate.

Lick Observatory bulletin No. 71, just Issued,
contains a history of the binary star, Cotl 821
This star was discovered to bÂ£ double by
Burnham In 1875. but. owing to the lack of
observations, no reliable orbit has been pub
lished. By combining the observations made
with the 36- inch telescope since* 1897 with thj
earlier measures Assistant Astronomer Altken
now finds it possible to compute an orbit that
represent* the motion so far observed. The two
stars in this system make one revolution about
their common center of mass Jn twenty-four
years, and the relative orbit is more nearly
circular than Is usual In double -star systems.
In connection with this Investigation Dr
Altken calls attention to the confusion exist
ing in the notation employed by computers of
double-star orbits, and urges the adoption of
a simple and convenient system of notation
suggested by Director Campbell.
The bulletin also contains an account of
another short- period binary in the constellation
Cetus. known ac 13 Ceti. From observation*
made with the 36- Inch equatorial it is evident
that the pair will have a very short r-ertod of
revolution but the data are not yet sufficient
for the calculation of a reliable orbit.

and give the Glee Club needed "tone"
by adding their names to its member
ship roll. It is declared in some quar
ters that the insinuation of social un
worth on the part of the present mem
bers of the Glee Club is a slur that
calls for explanation.
In other college camps, however.
Bishop's plain spoken words regarding
the situation receive commendation,
being declared to constitute just the
sort of medicine needed to save the
Glee Club from oblivion, or what is
worse to some of the college folk
absorption by the hoi polloi of the uni
versity.
The trouble had its origin in the
changed conditions of membership in
the Glee Club, made last term, when
it was decided to permit any varsity
man who could sing to join the Glee
Club. Hitherto the censorship had
been much more rigid than that. Many
a man, yearning to don a tuxedo and
plunk the banjo or warble a college
ditty in the ranks of the aristocratic
Glee Club cohorts found his ambi
tions nipped in the bud by those wÂ»io
controlled affairs. The applicant must
have social standing, he was told.
Then it was a badge of social distinc
tion to be a Glee Club man. It was sup
posed to mean that society girls bowed
down and worshipped when Glee Club
men appeared on the horizon. Other
perquisites there were, all procured
upon the assumption that Glee Club
membership spelled high social stand
ing.
Now all this has changed, say the
"frat" men. To become a member
one must be merely a good singer.
The art of wearing perfectly a dress
suit, of posing in the limelight of the
stage so that social glory is reflected
from the clubmen upon the university
is not now required of candidates for
membership and the "frat" men, in
disgust at the altered conditions, have
withdrawn, it is said, the support they
hitherto have given the Glee Club.
From being a "frat" institution the
Glee Club has degenerated into an
organization that merely sings well
and lacks the finer social graces ac
cording to its detractors. It is said
that the recent affair at Mills Col
lege, where the Glee Club men were
accused of flirting from the stage with
Mills College girls, convinced the
"frat" men that their criticisms of
the social qualifications of the present
Glee Club were well founded. It was
argued that the former Chesterfields
of the Glee Club never would have
permitted such charges to be made.
Gravel Train Parts on Track.
While running down grade a gravel
train separated yesterday afternoon on
Illinois street. Peter Webb, Gus
May and another man were standing
on the side of the Santa Fe railroad
track at the time. The runaway sec
tion of the train knocked the three
men into the bay. When fished out
Webb was found to have suffered
serious injuries. May escaped with a
slight scalp wound while the third
man escaped with a ducking.
The two injured men were treated
at the Potrero Hospital by Dr. Buell,
after which Webb was removed to
St. Luke's Hospital.

OLD CANNON
"Squatter/ a lielic of Early
Days. Dug From Scrap
Heap, Is to Be Inscribed
HAS SPLENDID HISTORY
Reealk Days of '54. Wlion It
Defended Oakland Settlers
From Vast Land Grabbing
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
101S Broadway, Feb. 2Â«.
After having been consigned to
the scrap heap of the Corpora
tion Yard, to be sold for old iron,
an old cannon, known among the
early residents of the city as the
"Squatter," has been recovered by
those who are aware of its historic
value. The City Council last night
adopted a resolution requesting the
Board of Public Works to have the old
gun suitably inscribed and mounted
in City Hall Park.
The history of the old gun is closely
linked with the early annals of Oak
land. The piece is said to have been
one of the broadside guns of the old
United States sloop-of-war John Jay,
on which Benjamin Franklin sailed
when he went to France as the repre
sentative of this Government. This
vessel was afterwards turned into a
merchant craft and came to the Pa
cific Coast.
During the land troubles of 1854 a
military organization was formed to
protect the settlers holding land un
der the old Peralta grants, and the
gun was presented to this company.
In the height of the land grant trou
bles this military company was called
out to repel a gang of squatters, who
had been imported from the lumber
camps by H. W. Carpentier to seize the
land held by settlers under the old
Spanish grants. The gun was planted
commanding the old draw bridge
which at that time stood on the site
of the present Twelfth street dam.
When the squatters found them
selves confronted by artillery they
hastily withdrew and left the settlers
In peace.
After this the gun became the prop
erty of the old "Oakland Guard," and
was used during the Civil War to fire
a salute for each victory achieved by
the Federal arms. "Salutes were also
fired when the news was received of
the laying of the Atlantic cable, at the
completion of the first telegraph line
across the continent, and on the ar
rival of the first overland train, which
entered Oakland drawn by the loco
motive Reindeer. Minute guns were
also fired when Lincoln was assas
sinated.
The members of the firing squad of
the "Old Guard," which handled the
"Squatter" and who rescued %he his
toric cannon were:
John Ross, James McDevot. L. J. Hardy.
James de Bolce. John Larsen. E<Jward Heriy,
J Tyrell. Charles E. Luffcln. George Parsons.
Benjamin Maloon, G. H. Blake, Isaac Win
gate G H. Fogy. D. Thompaon. Franklin
Warner. O. H. Staples, "William Watts and
John Potter.
The gun was at one time mounted
ir the City Hall Park, but was later
stuck muzzle down near the old Free
Library for a post. A few weeks ago
it was removed to the Corporation
Yard. At the last meeting of the "Old
Guard" a committee composed of Cap
tain W. J. Petersen, J. Tyrell and
Henry Maloon was appointed to pre
sent a resolution to the Council ask
ing that the old gun be preserved.

SPEAKS OS EXPEDITION
TO THE MAGNETIC POLE
i Consul Henry Lund Delivers Instruc
( tive Liecture Before Geograph
ical Society of the Pacific.
An interesting and instructive lee
â  ture was delivered last night by Henry
Lund, local Consul for Sweden and
Norway, before the Geographical So
ciety of the Pacific in the Academy of
, Sciences hall. The subject was "To
the Magnetic North Pole â the Gjoa
! Expedition."
Consul Lund told how Captain
I Roald Amundsen and seven others
left Norway in 1903 in the little sloop
: Gjoa for Greenland, whence the party
W s to sail into the Arctic Ocena north
of the American continent for the
purpose of ascertaining the exact lo
; cation of the magnetic North Pole.
! Amundsen was then to find his way
through the northwest passage and
return by way of Bering Sea to the
port of San Francisco.
Consul Lund said the expedition
I may arrive here the latter part of the
â  year, but more probably it will not
j put into this port until the autumn
1 of 1906, and possibly not until 1907.
The last heard from the captain
was when news from him reached
Europe November 29, last year. The
message was then over one year old.
At the timp it was written, August
24, 1903, the expedition had reached
, Erebus Bay, Beechey Island. All
i were well and were about to leave on
that same day for the supposed loca
tion of the magnetic North Pole on
Bootchia Island.

UNION LEAGUE
IS PROSPEROUS
Club Fixes a Limit of City
Membership at Thousand
and Adopts New By-Laws
SPIRITED MEETING HELD
Applications for Admission
Far Exceed the Estimates
Made Prior to Kenioval
A general meeting of the members
of the Union League Club last evening
was largely attended, and quite a dis
cussion on topics pertaining to the
management and direction of club af
fairs took place. The members were
called together for the purpose of con
sidering the report of the special com
mittee on constitution and new by
laws. Colonel George H. Pippy, presi
dent of the league, presided, and Col
onel Jesse B. Fuller read the report
of the committee. -
The new regulations adopted last
night, and which will take effect im
mediately, limit the resident member
ship to one thousand, and the number
of suburban members to three hundred.
There is no limit to the number of the
State norrÂ»resident, life and honorary
membership. The suburban class em
braces members who do not reside in
San Francisco, but dwell within a
radius of fifty miles of this city. The
limit of this class is very nearly at
tained, and the club may be impelled
by future pressure to extend the privi
leges of the class to more than the
number now prescribed. Provision is
made in the new by-laws for army and
navy members. The State member
ship embraces those who reside in
California, but at a greater distance
than fifty miles from San Francisco.
A life membership in the Union League
is not hedged with a qualification of
residence, but it involves the payment
in advance of $500. â¢
Questions relating to the transfer
from suburban, State and non-resident
classes to the resident membership en
gaged prolonged attention at the meet
ing. The by-laws as reported by the
committee were amended, or amplified,
to make the proposition clear that an
amount equaling the difference in the
initiation fee between the outside and
resident classes should be paid by any
one who was transferred from another
class to the resident class.
The Union League is in a remarkably
prosperous c< ndition, and the number
of applications for membership sur
passes all estimates formed when the
project for moving from New Mont
gomery street to the present location
on Union Square was originally pre
sented. There are indications that the
club will take national rank along with
the Union Leagues of Chicago and
New York. The new membership re
presents many active and progressive
young men, who will not attain the
"chloroform age" within the next
twenty years. They are manifesting
keen interest in the affairs of the in
stitution
It would not surprise the politicians
if they should exert quite a force in
the next State campaign. The club
promptly met all the pecuniary obliga
tions incident to the removal from the
old quarters to the spacious house
formerly occupied by the Pacific
Union, and at the same time retained
quite a cash surplus in the treasury.
The ladies' grill and reception rooms
equipped in artistic and superb fashion
will be formally opened by a reception
to members and their families on Sat
urday evening, March 11.
James Larabee. the new manager of
the Union League, formerly held a re
sponsible station in the Hotel Touraine
and Young's of Boston. He resigned a
lucrative position at the St. Francis
Hotel to accept the league's offer. The
new manager is only twenty-eight
years of age, but his Boston creden
tials are to the effect that he is capable
of managing the most extensive oper
ations in the hotel line. The Union
League Club, fashioned as it now is,
resembles a big hotel. One hundred
and fifty members go there daily for
lunch. The dinner is elaborate and
served in modern hotel style. The
ladles' grill, the wine room and other
departments require the personal su
pervision of a man trained in the
business. ""â¢;â¢

Hart Greensfelder's
Mind Gives Way
Under Strain.
Hart Greensfelder, 23 years of age,
son of Naph B. Greensfelder, shot
himself in the mouth, the bullet
passing through his brain, at the resi
dence of his parents, 2123 Pine street,
at 8 o'clock Monday night. ..
The young man was discovered In a
precarious condition in the basement
by his father, who had him removed t&
his room and four doctors summoned.
In spite of every nossible attention and
the best of medical skill, Hart passed
away yesterday morning.
Young Greensfelder was a brilliant
scholar and graduated from the Uni
versity of California last year with
high honors. He was exceedingly ac
tive, taking part in debates and enter
tainments, and was also one of the
leaders in social and literary circles of
the university' town. He was in the
Carnot debating team, was chairman
of the senior extravaganza afternoon
committee, was at one time editor of
the Occident, chairman of the college
debating committee and member of the
Golden Bear and Phi Beta Kappa.
His ambition led him to continue his
studies and for four months he attend
ed the Hastings Law School in the
mornings, but owing to the strain was
advised to forego some of the task*
which he had voluntarily set for him
self.
On February 1 he received his ap
pointment as special agent of the Cen
sus Bureau for Manufacturers from
the Department of Commerce and La
bor, Washington. Though he deeply
appreciated the honor, he began to fear
that he might not be able to properly
perform his new duti"S.
Owing to the courtesy of the Coroner
the remains were permitted to rest at
the home of the stricken parents. Mr.
and Mrs. Greensfelder have two sur
viving children, Bernard and Miss
Helen Sutro Greensfelder.

MARDI GRAS
WILL BE GAY
Decorations of Olden Time
in Mary Searles Gallery
Are Dazzling and Unique
GOOD FUN IS PROMISED
Joan of Arc to Be Called
From Out of the Shadows
of the Past, to Live Again
SALLY SHARP
The Mardi Gras is but six days
awayâ the glad, gay spectacle to which
the "Paris of America" treats itself
once every year ere it wraps its soul
in the purple of repentance.
Of course, there are those who say '
that San Francisco doesn't thrill to
the Mardi Gras spiritâ that the grim
gorgons of self-consciousness and prig
gishness stalk about. But don't you
believe it.
At last year's ball every man, maid
and matron who had a spark of ginger
in his composition â and a snatch of
imaginationâ had a merry good time.
And this year promises better! and be
cause more people "who belong" are
going.
Already the decorations of the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art are well un
der way, the splendor centralizing in
tIM Mary Searles gallery.
Here will Joan of Arc, bearing aloft
her cross and her distaff, receive 'â 
homage from the men of every nation.
It is said that at the head of the
pageantry, composed of all the person
ages of the French court, the Maid of
Orleans will ride triumphantly upon a
milk- white steed, led by picturesque
pages.
Now all this Is very effective and ;
undoubtedly very artictic, but there
are many women of henna hair who
object to the white horse â for obvious
reasons. However, if sufficient influ
ence b? brousrht to bear upon Perham
I Nahl or Captain Fletcher, a dapple- ',
I gray mieht be substituted. The dec
orative scheme has been evolved from
the conceptions and the fine under- ;
standing of H. J. Breuar, the painter, !
who has delved deep into the study of I
the tremulous, picturesque times of
the fair Maid of Orleans.
Thus has he emblazoned the yield
ing walls with the escutcheon, the
crown and the swerd, the oriflamme of j
war, and, surmounting all, the regnant
I lleur-de-lis.
1 . On the west side of the gallery the
1 throne is reared aloft. Its drapings
â  of blue velvet emblazoned with gold, j
I gorgeous enough to have hung o'er the '
! head of the beatified Maid in her I
; glory.
j Round about the galleries' sides are
! various devicesâ hundreds of them â j
coats of arms, banners and shields, !
emblazoned upon carnival-colored pan- I
els of bunting, while overhead are j
I strung thousands of colored light
bulbs, all radiating from the throne in 1
I wavelike fashion.
As a result of former experience, the !
I calcium lights will this year be loosed
i upon the pageant from a little medieval (
castle opposite the throne. By the !
, innovation, the occupants of boxes at 'â 
either end of the gallery will not be
, dazzled with light as formerlyâlike
wise will the dramatic effect be height
ened.
The main hall, where the gay pro
1 cession will form, will be ablaze with
! red and yellow lanterns, with golden 'â 
balls swinging from the arched dome. 1
i in elfish fashion.
In all truth. San Francisco will '
' never have known so gay a Mardi !
1 Grasâ nor so smart.
And as for sensations â but of these !
I I must not tellâ until next Wednesday!
NEW SCHOOL GRADING
MEETS WITH PROTEST
Residents of Xoe Valley Meet With
Superintendent Langdon to Tell
Him of Grievances.
The recent grading by the Board
of Education of schools in Noe Val
ley, by which the James Lick School
was set apart for grammar grades
and the Noe Valley for primary, has
stirred up trouble for the directors,
for last night a mass meeting of the
parents was held in Plant's Hall at
Twenty-fourth and Douglas streets to
voice indignation and protest. Super
intendent W. H. Langdon had agreed
to meet the parents and was on hand

of the school children and Mr. Lang

exchange of views it was agreed that

THE RIVER BILL.
THE opposition to the river rectification bill, framed by the ex
ecutive committee, has been too strong for it, and another
measure has been framed to take its place. The new bill creates
a reclamation district of a million acres and creates a board of con
trol, composed of one member from San Joaquin County, two from
Sacramerio, one from Yolo, and one each from Sutter, Yuba, Colusa,
Glenn and Butte counties. It will be observed that of the nine
members six are from above Sacramento. The land holders on the
upper river positively and with some expressions of bitterness op
posed the original bill because in the preliminary proceedings by the
promotion committee and later on by the executive committee they
complained that they were ignored and their interests were not con
sidered.
The Colusa Sun, which is the most watchful of these matters of
any paper in the State and the best qualified to advise, counsels the
land owners to accept the substitute bill. It authorizes the board
of control to assess the land in the districts it creates not more than
too for the preliminary work, and to invite the co-operation of
the State and the United States. No further assessment is to be
levied until such co-operation is secured. Nor may this be called
for unless the board find it can be put to a useful purpose. As it
amounts to only five cents per acre there is no doubt that it will be
cheerfully paid and can be wisely spent.
The capital mistake made in the original bill seems to have been
leaving the land owners out of it entirely, and its preparation by non
residents of the district concerned. This was sure not only to excite
the resentment and opposition of the interested parties who were not
consulted, but it was a bad thing for the success of the proposition
to join the State and the United States in the reclamation project.
The first thing asked in Congress will be. "What are the land owners
doing?" If the answer be that they are doing nothing, the effect
will be bad. But when it can be said that the land owners have taken
the initiative, have provided a board of control, to be elected by
themselves, and have provided a fund of $50,000, the feeling will
be very different.
Taking the attitude of the valley press and of the Sacramento
Valley Development Association to be representative, as expressive
of popular feeling on the subject, we conclude that the land owners
have forced a right start by their opposition to the original bill, and
that they have done the best thing to strengthen the hands of our
representatives in Congress. The right start was the main necessity
of the case. In the depleted condition of the national treasury a
present appeal fop funds is impossible, so that ample time will be
had for prudent preparation of the preliminary work.
We have no doubt that eventually the State and the nation will
share the cost of this work between them, perhaps putting some of it
Â«^n the land. When it is considered that the island reclamations in
the lower reaches of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers cost
from $10 per acre upward, and that such reclamations pay largely
because of the high quality of the land, it is evident that the million
acres, interested in this large reclamation can stand no insignificant
part of the cost. If assessed at the minimum of $10 per acre there
would be left only $14,000,000 of the estimated cost of the whole
Ie to be divided between the State and Federal governments. We
are not advising such assessment. But if it be made at all it will
be cheerfully accepted if made by the land owners' own board of con
trol, while there would be rebellion throughout the Sacramento
Valley if it were made by non-resident and non-interested parties.
The j>eople want a large part in a matter so important to them, and
will volunteer assistance and contributions which they would resent
if forced upon them from the outside.
The Colusa Sun is clearly right in saying that the work "must
with the land owners. It is worth $50,000 to get the land
owners organized and on a talking basis with each other. The
proposition must come from them to the State and National govern
ments. In nearly all the counties having overflowed lands the people
were indignant because they were not consulted, and a few outsiders
thought they knew more about the land owners' business than they
did themselves. Now were we a land owner in the proposed district
1 iuld consent to the passage of the new bill. It at least would
make a start in a great work."
The indications are that such is the sentiment of the Sacramento
Valley, and as it releases the members of the Legislature from the
valley counties from the obligation they were under to oppose the
original bill, there should be no reason why the new bill should not
pass. There is but little time left before adjournment of the session,
but what is to be done should be done quickly. We think the Legis
lature will make no mistake in aligning with the valley people and
the land owners.
THE TRAGEDY ENDED.
WITH the expulsion of four Senators by the unanimous vote
of their colleagues at Sacramento, one phase of the tragedy
ends. It had enough squalid and revolting features to nearly
overshadow those that were pitifully picturesque. It began in a
scheme of private vengeance, intended to be wreaked upon citizens
who had shown political independence, discretion and morality, and
were to be punished therefor by assaults upon them in their busi
ness and professional relations. It ended not only in the discom
fiture of all of the conspirators, but in the severe punishment and
humiliation of its instruments.
Passing over the painful effect upon the trusting and the inno
cent, the families of the humiliated men, because that pitiful feature is
so entirely personal that it may not be publicly treated at length, the
ending of the affair in the Senate is admonitory to a degree so in
tense that it will be a purifying influence in the public life of the
State. Bad and criminal customs get warrant by sufferance. What
men ace others do in making traffic of official opportunity they come
to regard as a custom, and finally follow it with no twinge of con
science and no sense of turpitude.
Any one who would pretend that these four victims of their
own misconduct are the first offenders in the same field would be
scoffed at. They are merely the first ones caught and punished. That
we owe to the keenness and address of the intended victims of the
vengeance of which the four Senators were obviously the instru
ments. They have performed a public service as great as it was
difficult and painful. The air is cleared. The people are admonished
to consider character and fitness in the future in choosing their offi
cials, and the arm of political purity and reform is strengthened by
that painful scene of judgment in the Senate. . : ..

HIS HUNTING TRIP
THE Eligible Baohelor braced
himself against the shock and
stood It like a man.
He had been wandering along
the country road for half an
hour looking for a field that might
prove the hiding place of many rabbits,
when the thing occurred.
From behind a dilapidated old stone
fence that separated the field from
the adjoining wood a girl came run
ning pell mell, directly into the Eligi
ble Bachelor's arms.
He got one glimpse of a frightened
face before she buried it in the rough
ness of his hunting coat and clung to
him frantically.
"He's after me!" she gasped.
The man's face grew stern, he
brought his grun into more available
position and fixed his eyes on the
corner of the fence where the girl had
first appeared. There was a rattling
of dead leaves, more noise, he
thoght, than one man's feet could
possibly produce. The Eligible Bach
elor had never before had an oppor
tunity to play knight errant, but he
suddenly felt himself longing to kill
the scuundrel who had frightened this
girl.
There was another scurry of leaves
and thenâ a playful yearling, calf
stood before him, prancing in the
awkward way peculiar to sporting
calves, with an expression in its eyes
that seemed to wink at the man and
ask if he didn't see the point of the
joke. ' '
The Eligible Bachelor stared, then
let his gun fall to the ground.
"Good Lord!" he howled; "was that
what frightened you? "
The girl had wriggled out of his
arms and stood behind him, peering
around him for a safe glimpse of the
enemy.
"If he had already knocked you
down once and was trying to do it
again I don't suppose it would be so
funny to you," she said resentfully,
evidently not appreciating his ecstasy
of mirth. â  .
He sent the calf down the road
with a few warlike gestures and
turned to look at her, amusement still
lurking in his eyes.
She had seated herself on a stone
and was pinning up a torn place in
her skirt.
"Some people can laugh at noth
ing," she said icily, fitting the edges
of the torn place together.
The man looked at the small face,
rosy from the frosty morning air, and
noticed the short brown hair that
made little curls around her fore
head.
"I'm a brute to laugh," he said pen
itently, "but it was so â cr â sudden."
He was in danger of offending again.
He took his handkerchief to brush
the mud from her dress.
"You are evidently not accustomed
to them?" he queried, smiling.
"I have never had such close ac
quaintance with one before," she said.
DON'T WAIT TOO LONG
Too many people keep the flowers
they have plucked for you until the day
of your funeral. Their songs of praise
are not heard until your procession is
passing their door. The mantle of
charity does not become public prop
erty until put in use by the preacher
who conducts the "last sad rites." If
a man has flowers for me I want them
while I am on earth and can smell
their fragrance. They will do me no
good sitting at the head of my CQffin.
The grass that Is kept green about my
last resting place will be of little avail
to me on the other shore. Here is
where I need the flowers and the smiles
and the praise, not over there. If the
fellow who is going to go around to
the house after I am gone to see "if
he can be of any help" will come
around to-morrow I can tell him how
he can be of a whole lot of help. There
will be plenty of them. It is all-fired
short no\y. Carry your flowers to the
living and sing your songs of praise
at the dinner-table. Don't wait for
the funeral. â Osborne, Ohio, Farmer.
HOSPITAL FOR FISH
The Frankfort News states that
since the beginning of the winter
term a station for research and ob
servation has been established at the
veterinary high school of Vienna, un
der the direction of Professor Dictor
Fiebiger. Officials of this institution
will investigate the biology and pa
thology of fish. One of the main sub
jects of the researches will be to study
whether certain diseases of fish are
transmitted to man, and if so to what
extent. The scientific diagnosis of the
sick fish is affixed to each compart
ment containing ehem. Fishes are
to be found suffering from smallpox
and others from intestinal catarrh. A
dolphin was brought to the institute
with a disease which was diagnosed
as inflammation of the lungs. The di
rector is very reluctant about express-
Ing an opinion with reference to the
curability of fish diseases. At any
rate. Instructive observations In the
field of comparative therapeutics may
be expected.

"I'm down here on a little hunting

also taking a rest from being hunted

mammas. "I wonder if they would

she were 16 or 20. "Maybe you will
accept them as a peace offering and
forgive me for laughing."
A hint of shyness in her eyes made
him understand that her resentment
was really a reaction from the em
bi.-rrassh.ient of having rushed into
his arras, now that her fright was
over and the cause at a distance
seemed so trivial.
She gave a regretful look at the
torn place in her skirt. "I never shall
be able to mend it so it won't show,"
she said as she left him.
The Eligible Bachelor was medita
tive as he climbed the stone wall to
â wage war on the rabbits.
"Now I wonder," he mused, "if that
little girl is so poor that a torn place
in a blue serge skirt can worry her?
It's a shame!" He strode through
the tangle of briars and dead weeds
thoughtfully.
Next day the Eligible Bachelor's
valet went back to town, and his mas
ter established himself as a boarder
it the Jones farm, with only gun and
suit case for baggage.
The- gun was in small demand â
there seemed much more pleasure in
jogging: along country roads and help
ing a girl regain her strength. She
looked so tiny and dainty perched
upon the big horse that the Eligible
Bachelor vowed to himself that he
had never seen an equestrienne in
Central' Park that compared with her.
"Wouldn't it be just lovely," sh*
began one day when they had stopped
to regain their breath after a bounc
ing race on their large-limbed steeds,
"if one didn't have to work for a liv
ing?"
His mind flew to his bank account,
enough to last several generations, if
a man could only get three score and
ten extended that long.
1 Do you find teaching so terrible?"
"It's not the work." She grew con
fidential. "It's that I want so many
things â pretty things like some wom
en have."
"Might a mere man ask what these
things may be â as applied to your
own desires?"
"Oh, a sable neckpiece and a muff,
a lovely brass bedstead to sleep on,
some long wrinkly gloves and some soft
traily dresses, lots of violet water,
manicured nails, a French maid â "
"Hadn't you better wait till I cali
a stenographer?" he interrupted.
"But wouldn't it be blissful to have
them?" she sighed. "I would give my
torn walking skirt to the deserving
poor and not bother about it any
more," she wound up ruefully.
He let his face assume its most
doleful aspect.
"1 wish I had all these things to of
fer you." He broke a twig from the
hedge with a vigorous cut from his
riding whip.
She sat suddenly erect on her horse
and he watched her from the corner
of his averted eye.
"A poor dog of a man feels that he
has nothing to offer a girl," he con
tinued morosely.
She looked at him hesitatingly. "I
don't .want all those things so dread
fully; much," she said shyly. (Copy

WOMAN HUMORIST
New York owns a woman humorist
of rare quality. Marguerite Mering
ton: Js her name, and the world of fun
her field. Miss Merington has a sense
of humor livelier than that possessed
by many a man who holds high rank
as a mirthmaker, and she compels
recognition of It In unrestricted com
petition with, trousered wits. She
poked fun at John Kendrick Bangs,
Rear Admiral Coghlan, Israel Zangwill
and Charles Battell Loomis at a club
meeting In the Waldorf-Astoria early
in the season so effectively that none
of them has dared cross blades with
her since. Her humor is of the quiet
sort, but the genuine fun In It sparkles
through her quiet manner like sun
shine through moonlight. She ad
dresses her victim at the outset with
the prettiest of purrs and coos, but by
the time she approaches the point of
the witticism he usually scents danger
and beats a retreat with the laughter
of the listeners ringing In his ears.

A SONG OF CHEER
Sing me a song from the noon of the day,
Wakf- a refrain from Its glory;
Bring me the flow'rets that bloom on the way:
Make life a beautiful story;
Swell the tweet anthems that ring with a hope
Born not on earth and its sorrow;
Tell me of gates that are waiting to ope
For us on the "perfect to-morrow"!
Sing to me never of night or of gloom-
Life holds enough of such sadness â
Chill and decay let us hide in the tomb:
Death gives no echo of gladness.
Cast not a shadow; encourage no strife;
Time to its close is fast speeding;
Harvest the Joy and the sunshine of life;
And follow where conscience Is leading.

HERBERT YOELL ATTENDS
TRIAL OF" WUA. CONTEST
Hears Witness Tell of Father's Oppo-
sition to Marriage Which Proved
I'ailuro.
Another hatch of witnesses who
knew J. Alexander Yoell and had an
opportunity to form an opinion as to
the condition of his mind testified
yesterday in Judge Kerrigan's court in
behalf of the proponents of the will.
Herbert Yoell of New York, a son,
who has just been sued for mainte
nance by his wife, was present in
court for the first time and heard his
domestic difficulties discussed. D.
Laviolette of the St. Ignatius Sodality
was one of Yoell's closest friends and
played cards or chess with him twice
a week. So attentive was he that
strangers had remarked that he was
trying to get some of the old man's
money. He remembered only one oc
casion when Yoell had given way to
his temper and that was when he,
Lavtolette, won nine straight games.
The witness said that Yoell often
spoke of his family troubles and
blamed Herbert and John Yoell for
causing them. The father had opposed
Herbert's marriage, but after the
young man left his wife and she re
fused to get a divorce Yoell senior
said that he would give her some
money because she had to take care
of the child.
Thomas M. Osmont, who played
chess with Yoell at the Pleasanton,
told of his conversations with the pio
neer. He said that Yoell spoke high
ly of Mr. Delmas. "I do not think
that was an indication of his insan
ity," said Delmas.
"I merely mentioned it to show the
trivial subjects discussed," replied the
witness.
Dr. Washington Dodge, who treated
Yoell at the springs, and Henry W.
Eisert of Umbsen & Co.. who attended
to Yoell's rents, added their expres
sions of belief in the man's sanity.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1905.
ATTORNEY' AND CLIENT ARE
FOUND GUILTY' OF CONTEMPT
M. C. Hassett and Annie Peterson
Disregard Order to Appear Be
fore Judge Coffey.
Imprisonment is in prospect for At
torney M. C Hassett and his client,
Annie Peterson, unless they are able
to offer a satisfactory explanation of
their contemptuous disregard of Judge
Coffey's ord-r to show cause why they
should not pay inheritance tax upon

The hearing was on the calendar for
yesterday, but neither Hassett nor his
client appeared. The court's patience
was exhausted and he adjudged the
pair guilty of contempt. Attorney
John S. Partridge, representing the
City Treasurer, prepared an order for
the commitment of Hassett and Mrs.
Peterson to jail. The amount of the
tax was $232 83 in December, 1902,
and it is charged that the court was

Bought Mine Under Water.
A suit for the recovery of $40,000
sunk In an unprofitable mining ven
ture was begun yesterday by the
Prosperity Gravel Mining Company
against Philip C. and Alice M. Cohn.
I: is alleged that in Mar.eh, 1902. the
company leased from the defendants
forty acres of the Johnson ranch in
Sucramento County upon representa
tions that the gravel at bedrock was
worth $3 a car and that thfcre was
a rich streak that would yield $40 in
yellow metal to the car. A seventy
foot shaft and other workings at the
time were filled with water and no
investigation could be made. A pay
ment of $5000 was made for the lease,
and $35,000 was expended in develop
ing the property, whereupon. It is said,
the bedrock was found to be worth
not more than ten cents a car, while
the "rich" streak panned only twertty
cents.

LARGER NORMAL
SCHOOL WANTED
Action of Supervisors An
ticipates Further Appro
priation by Legislature
XEED BETTER QUARTERS
Buildings Are Too Small to
Accommodate Pupils Who
Desire to Be Educated
The action of the Board of Super
visors Monday last in pledging them
selves to give to the State a plat ->f
ground in a suitable location for the
erection of a State normal school
building is causing much favorable
comment throughout the city. In case
a convenient piece of land is not ob
tainable the board has promised to
add $50,000 to the State appropriation
for the erection of a fine modern
school structure. This has been ac
complished through' the untiring ef
forts of Dr. F. Burk, president of
the normal school trustees, and Dr.
A. A. d'Ancona of the Finance Com
mittee of the Supervisors.
Under the direction of the board of
trustees a bill for the appropriation
of $150,000 for the purchase of land
and the erection of a building has
been presented to the Legislature and
will be ready for the Governor's sig
nature next Saturday. The trustees
are certain that the bill will be signed.
The present State Normal School on
Powell street, between Sacramento
and Clay, is cramped and dingy. Over
six years ago it was condemned by the
city. The facilities for good work are
very limited and the demand for
teachers throughout the city and
Sta&t far exceeds the supp.y the Nor
mal can turn out. In the small quar
ters there are at present 140 students,
forty of whom graduate each year.
The building was built in 1850, at
which time it was used as a church.
In 1854 it was made over into a school
and served as such until 1899, when
it was condemned. The appropriation
for a State normal school at that time
was too small to permit the building
of a large school and the Board of
Education allowed the State to use
the Powell-street house free of rental.
The Le Conte School was also turned
over to the use of the normal and at
the present time houses over 300 chil
dren with normal students as their
teachers.
Notice was served recently by the
Board of Education upon the Normal
School that after the first of July the
city would collect $120 a month rent
from the State institution. This sum.
together with the cost of numerous
repairs that have to be made from
time to time, would mean a heavy ex
pense to the State and the only salva
tion is in the legislative and local ap
propriations.
The Le Conte School is destined
soon to prove a stumbling block in the
way of the Board of Education when
the time comes for the rebuilding of
the Washington School under the
bond issue. Temporary quarters will
have to be secured for the children of
that school, and as the LÂ»e Conte is
only a block away that building has
been suggested. The Normal officials
say, however, that although they
would have room for the additional
number of children it would be a
hardship to turn out the Normal stu
dents who are studying to be teachers
to m;ike way for the teachers in the
Washington School, who might other
wise be idle.
All of the Normal School graduates
have obtained positions as teachers
and rank among the highest in stand
ing in the School Department. Over
one-third of the graduates are as
; signed to San Francisco, while one
fourth of the remainder get positions
in the bay cities.

MAYOR HEARS COMPLAINT
OF POOR STREET SWEEPING
Directs Commissioners of Works to
Do Best They Can With Limited
Funds Available.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday called
Commissioners of Works Aigeltinger
and Eagan into consultation relative
to the complaint of the Federated
Mission Clubs that the streets are not
being properly swept. Aigeltinger ex
plained that the appropriation had
been overdrawn and a saving was be
ing effected in order to have $53,750
on hand to sweep the streets during
April, May and June, three of the
dustiest months of the year. There
was but $9000 available in February
and as a consequence many streets
could not be swept. Aigeltinger said
work would be done in M,arch, as
$IS,OOO could be utilized for the pur
pose. Commissioner Eagan stated
that the reason for the depletion of
the funds was the fact that a great
er territory had to be swept. The Com
missioners stated that they were han
dicapped in the work owing to the
non-arrival of three sweeping ma
chines purchased by the Board of Su
pervisors three weeks ago. Mayor
Schmitz directed the Commissioners
to do the best they could with the
funds at command and future action
will depend on the results attained
during March.

BURGLAR CAUGHT
WITH PLUNDER
William Davis Is Captured
by a Railroad Detective
and Special Policeman
THIEF HAS A SYSTEM
Persons Who Bought Goods
From Him Arrested for
Receiving Stolen Property
A clever capture was madÂ« by De
tective Peter Lewin of the Southern
Pacific Company and Special Police
man M. Hennessey about 1 o'clock yes
terday morning. The man arrested is
William Davis and he was booked at
the City Prison on a charge of burg
lary.
Complaints had been made to the
company of the non-receipt of goods
shipped from this city and on Monday
night Lewin and Hennessey boarded
the through freight train leaving here
at 9 o'clock. The train stops at Ocean
View to take off the helper. While this
was being done Davis was seen break-
Ing into a car. The train started with
Davis in the car. but at San Bruno sta
tion he alighted and was promptly
placed under arrest. He had with him
two cases of whisky which he had
stolen.
Davis was brought to the City Pris
on and made a confession yesterday to
Chief Klndelon of the Southern Pacific
detective department and Lewin. He
acknowledged to have stolen from a car
on January 12 two cases of harness;
on February 1 a case containing 5000
cigars, and on February 16 a case of
smoking tobacco. He rode to Ocean
View on the electric cars and waited
there till the through freight came
along, and while the helper was being
taken off he broke into a car and stole
the goods. Then he would leave the
train at Baden or San Bruno station
and return to the city with his plun
der on the electric cars.
Davis told the officers where he had
sold the stolen goods and they, with
the assistance of Detective Sergeant T.
L. Ryan arrested Ah Kee, 1003 Du
pont street; August Lefraneols, saloon
keeper, 633 Clay street, and S. A. Al
len, cigar dealer. 29 Market street, and
booked them at the City Prison for re
ceiving stolen property. Other arrests
will be made.
REDUCES NUMBER OF
SUBSTITUTE FIREMEN
i Fire Commission Effects Reorganiza.
tion of Temporary Employes
Now Limited to Fifty. '
The reorganization of the substi
tute list of the Fire Department went
into effect yesterday and as a result
thirty of the former substitutes were
I deprived of their positions. Some time
[ ago complaints were made that the
list of substitutes was too large, as
there was not sufficient employment
for the eighty men on the list. The
Fire Commission adopted a resolution
reducing the number to fifty, ten of
i whom were to be selected by each of
j the four Commissioners and ten by
Chief Engineer Sullivan.

BATTLING NELSON STOPS CORBETT IN NINTHROUND
EX-CHAMPION FEATHER-WEIGHT
SHOWS HIS VITALITY HAS VANISHED
DENVER BOXER IS OVERANXIOUS THROUGHOUT BATTLE]
Nelson Maintains
Decided Lead
Cleverly.
BOTH HIT HARD
Battling Kelson grained bis second
decisive victory over Young Corbett in
Woodward's Pavilion last night after
one ot the most desperate battles In
the history of the Queensberry ring.
The fight ended In the ninth round, but
the inevitable outcome was apparent
to the spectators after the fourth
round.
In all the history of athletics from
ancient times down to the present that
Intangible quality called vitality has
played an Important part, although it
can neither be seen nor located. Cor
bett presented a splendid muscular ap
pearance, but the vital spark was gone
and when heavy drains were made on
his nervous energy he fairly collapsed
and made a pitiable showing against
the Implacable Dane.
The latter seems more like whalebone
than flesh and blood, blows of the
hardest kind making no apparent im
pression on him. Corbett landed on his
head and Jaw and body, but there
never seemed a time when he was the
least bit distressed.
IX>ST HIS COOLNESS.
Corbett had told his friends he in
tended to fight cleverly, but he cast
discretion to the winds early in the
contest and commenced to swing wild
ly, thus playing into Nelson's hands.
Several times he received crushing
rights to the head when he rushed at
Nelson, thus accenting the force of the
blows. Corbett seldum made any at
tempt at guarding, being willing, ap
parently, at all times to take a blow if
there was a chance of landing one.
The blows which finally ended the
unequal contest were not so hard as
many which each man had landed dur
ing the fight. Corbett was in a bad
way early in the ninth round, after
ng a right and left to the head.
Nelson followed this with a hard left
- jaw and was pressing Corbett
about the ring. He suddenly caught
Corbet! a <juick jolty left on the jaw
and with almost lightning like rapidity
he shot ovt-r a right. Corbett fell on his
hack like a log. He was in the middle
f the ring and it seemed he was com
pletely knocked out.
He lay there motionless for five sec
onds and then slowly gathered his
scattered senses and made feeble ef
forts to stand up.
BADLY BEATEN".
At the count of nine, he barely was
on his feet and staggered over to the
ropes on the north side of the ring
.- -rui stood there helpless with his hands
ay bit side. Nelson walked up to him
slowly and 6truck him a hard right
he head.
Meantime Referee Welch, seeing the
helpless condition, was trying to pre
bran from punishing the de
feated man unnecessarily. The last
Mow Nelson struck sent Corbett to the
floor again and Welch led Nelson to
the middle of the ring and proclaimed
him the victor. In the meantime
Spider Kelly had tossed the sponge in
\>> the ring, signifying Corbett's defeat,
bat this was an unnecessary precau
tion, as the fight had been stopped.
After the fight Nelson showed no
marks whatever on his face or body,
while Corbett's face was badly puffed
up from the visitations of the Dane's
gloves.
There were several variations from
the recent fights of the two men, as in
this fight Nelson showed a tendency to
hold on in the earlier stages, while Cor
bett apparently tried to butt Nelson
with his head several times.
Nelson lowered his head after a while
and there were some sharp collisions,
but neither man was damaged. In the
eighth round. Referee Welch thought
he saw an inclination on the part of
Corbett to strike Nelson foul blows.
He warned the Denverite. and there
was no more trouble on that score.
In th? early part of the fight Corbett
kept Jabbing at Nelson and would not
let him get set, and It was some time
before Nelson could deliver an ef
fective blow.
BAD JUDGE OF DISTANCE.
For some reason Corbett proved a
bad Jadge of distance. Many cf his
ewings went wide of the mark. Cor
bett fought like a man whose life was
at stake while his vitality lasted, and
even when It was apparent he could
only win by some lucky punch he still
kept trying and trying, but to no avail.
He seemed always to have hopes of
landing a blow on some vital spot, but
there seemed to be no vulnerable place
on the Dane's body.
When proceedings opened, Corbett
was the first to get into action. He
feinted at Nelson, who moved about
slowly as if on a pivot. Corbett was
the first to land, sending a right to the
body. He followed this with two lefts
to the bead and a left to the body.
At this early stage of the proceedings
he was obviously anxious to land a de
cisive blow. He was easily outfeinting
Nelson and his friends felt sure he was
about to regain his lost laurels. The
crowd began to hiss Nelson for his
holding tactics. Nelson's most effective
blow in this round was a lefl to the
heed, which shook up Corbett. Corbett
was the first to get into action in the
second round, trying rights and lefts

BATTLING KELSON, WHO GAINED HIS SECOND DECISIVE VICTORY OVER
YOUNG CORBETT LAST NIGHT IN WOODWARD 1 S PAVILION AFTER NINE
DESPERATE ROUNDS OP FIGHTING.
DANE AFTER BRITT
XJLIEIjIj. I guess he knows
VV now that I can punch
some," were the first
words uttered by Battling Nel
son after his game little oppo
nent was laid out on the carpet.
"I waded in and won just as I
did before and just as I told my
friends I would do this time.
His wallops never hurt me.
After the fifth round I knew I
had him. Thos^e old come
backs did not bother me, for I
could see that he would blow
np. I took my time and when
I saw a chance I went in and
landed. Now lam ready to talk
to Britt. I have signed a con
tract t o meet him and posted
my SI SOO forfeit. He has not
covered it yet. I am still wait
ing. As soon as he shows the
color of Ids money I will feel
happy, lo r 1 am going to beat
him next time."
which did no damage. He tried rough
ing it with Nelson, but made no pro
gress in that direction. He kept jab-,
bing at Nelson repeatedly and the lat
ter could not get set. Corbett missed
a hard left arid walked into a right.
Nelson followed this up with a right
and left, and Corbett missed a right.
He caught Nelson a right on the Jaw,
but it made no impression on the Dane.
Nelson landed his first effective blow
early in the first round when he
caught Corbett with a straight to the
head when the latter was coming in.
Nelson followed up this with a left
and right to the head. He slipped to
his knees about the middle of the
round, but was up instantly. Corbett
fairly raised Nelson off his feet in this
round with a left to the head. Both
men were nghting desperately when
the bell rang.
HIS LAST STAXD.
The fourth round was all nghting
and this was Corbett's last great stand.
Here was where he exhausted his stock
of. vitality and he was never the same
after that. Early in the round he
walked into a hard right, but came
back quickly and there was a great
slugging match. Nelson sent in a ter
rible right to the body and followed
this with a right to the head. Corbett
responded with a right to the body and
got a left in return. Just as the bell
sounded, Corbett sent a hard left to the
Jaw.
Corbett sent a Jolty left to the head
at the opening of the fifth round and
got a left to the head and riÂ«"ht to the
body in return. He again walked in
to one of Nelson's right handers and
began to bleed badly at the mouth.
Nelson rushed Corbett to the ropes
and landed several hard rights to the
jaw, following them 1 with rights' and
lefts to the jaw that sent Corbett to
his corner in distress.
Nelson was improving steadily as
; the fight progressed, while it was ap
, parent Corbett was on the down
i grade. Nelson kept after him relent
lessly in the sixth round, and Corbett
backed away to gain a little breathing
i spell. Corbett was wrestled to the
I floor early in the round, but he was
up quickly. Corbett was helpless on
the ropes near the end of the round
j and Nelson was able to hit him when
j ever he wanted to. It seemed Nel-
J son coutd have finished him any time
he wanted, but let -him stay.
VIVACITY AIAj GOÂ°SE.
When the seventh round opened it
was apparent Corbett had lo^t all the
vivacity which marked his appearance
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 19Q5.
NO EXCUSE TO MAKE.
|k I ELSON beat me fairly
IN and squarely," said
Yonng Corbett after the
mill. "I have no excuses to of
fer and I do not want to detract
from the glory coming to him.
I was in as good shape as I
ever was in my life before. Nel
son simply wore me down. I
thought I had a chance In that
eighth round when I waded in
and brought rights and lefts
over as fast as I could steer
them. I had him worried and
I really believed 1 was going to
put him out. But I could not
last, I was worn down and all
my strength left me. I was
game to the last and never
wanted to quit. No, 1 will not
quit the game. I will keep on
training and show the public
that I am capable of coming
back and beating a lot of them."
in the earlier rounds. Early in the
seventh Nelson sent in some jolty
rights and lefts which beat down
Corbett's already weakened guard and
left him apparently defenseless. Cor
bett landed a hard left swing on Nel
son's jaw in the middle of the round,
but it was too high to be effective.
Nelson kept on scoring with right
and left.
In the eighth round Nelson's blows
could harflly be counted. They
came with a lightning-like rapidity,
and, while none of them were hard,
the aggregate amount of punishment
was terrific. It was in this round that
the referee warned Corbett not to hit
low and not to introduce any butting
tactics into the game.
Nelson went after Corbett In a
systematic manner in the ninth and
last round. Corbett made some wild
swings in an attempt to stem the tide
of defeat, but the power was not there.
Although the spectators were expect
ing the end at any moment, when It
finally came it took them somewhat by
surprise, as many harder blows had
been struck during the fight than the
decisive ones.
Corbett was the first to enter the
ring and was to all outward appear
ances in the best possible condition.
The muscles of his chest and stomach
-howed prominently, while his trim
legs bore testimony to the many miles
that he had trudged over the Marin
County roads during the last two
months. He was warmly greeted by
the spectators when he appeared, ac
companied by Frank McDonald, Joe
Gans, Spider Kelly and Tim McGrath.
It was ten minutes later before Nelson
appeajred accompanied by Billy Nolan,
Fred Landers, Martin Murphy and
Rawhide Kelly. As usual Nelson was
introduced as "the hardest nut In the
profession to crack." Billy Jordan
then presented Young Corbett as "one
of the best boys in the world."
Brjtt was next presented and he
said he was always willing to fight
any man at his weight. He shook
hands with the two boxors and with
Joe Gans. There were loud calls for
Gans, who wa= given the most cor
dial greeting of the night when Billy
Jordan introduced him as "the light
weight champion of the world."
There were loud calls for a speech,
and the Baltimore wonder said: "I'll
keep quiet for a while and let these
boys do the nghting."
Eddie Hanlon sent a telegram from
the East challenging the .winner. Be
fore the fight Nelson had a worried
look and seemed drawn to the last
ounce. .The flesh hardly seemed tc

Description of Fight by Rounds

Following is a description of the
fight by rounds, showing how Nelson

Round 1.

ARABO, PILOTED BY TREUBEL,
BEATS LETOLA A NECK.
SCHOOLMATE A HEAD BEFORE SAN NICHOLAS
IN THE DISTANCE EVENT AT OAKLAND
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
If the earls of frenzied finance and
the relentless ticker have made a stall
walker of Thomas Lawson, the Boston
trust buster, Walter Jennings has his
troubles, too. His mare Letola lost the
six and a half furlong handicap at
Oakland yesterday to Arabo, by a
neck, with nine out of every ten race
goers willing to go before a notary
and make oath that she was best.
It's only about four or five weeks
back that Walter disposed of Arabo
to "Kansas" Price. Letola was the
choice of the talent, and nearly every
body separated themselves from any
loose change they had at odds of
seven to five. There was a time dur
ing the race when the coin looked
well set. Then "Big Bill" Knapp in
his anxiety to grab the wire .first,
made a sweeping turn into the stretch
with the favorite, while at the same
time Treubel on Arabo stole through
on the rail. Treubel suved two
lengths easily enough and down at
the finishing line slapped it on
Knapp by a neck. Toledo ran third,
Venator pulled up lame and Andrew
B. Cook wilted away.
Despite the somewhat depressing
blow, the big crowd witnessed some
splendid sport. A long shot enlivened
proceedings, and three favorites pick
ed up purses.
Finishing necks apart The Volt, rid
den by Bonner and a 6 to 5 favorite,
earned the decision over Sterling
Towers and Yellowstone for the in
troductory sprint. Sterling Towers
made all the running and should have
won, but at the last Bonner out
finished Wright. With any sort of
racing luck, Dr. Sherman would have
been among the first three.
Hugh McGowan closed favorite over
Flaunt for the mile and a sixteenth
selling affair, and won all the way.
The second choice received excellent
handling from Birkenruth, but was
not good enough to do the trick. Tir
ing badly the last furlong, he was beat
en for the place by Maxetta, a 50 to 1
shot with E. Walsh in the saddle.
Young Clark landed Pickaway first
for the five and a half furlong scram
ble at odds of 10 to 1. The fast geld
ing received some support and leading
throughout, disposed of Fort Wayne
by a couple of lengths in 1:07%- Silent
Water weakened the last sixteenth,
running a good third. Jakie Jones on
the favorite succeeded in getting lost i
in the discard.
With Major Manslr in disgrace and
on the suspended list, but four started
in the mile and a quarter purse event.
It proved a good betting race, as
Schoolmate and San Nicholas closed
equal favorites, and Stilicho did not
lack for friends. Jones on San Nicho
las cut out the pace and hung on in
a surprising manner, as the route
looked far for the black horse. Trr.u
bel on Schoolmate crowded on all sail
the last three-sixteenths of the trip
and riding an exceedingly vigorous fin
ish, won by a head in 2:o6Vfc. Stilicho
was a keen contender at the close, be
ing beaten less than a length. Col.
Anderson seemed shy on speed.
Just to be fashionable, Alarie with
the leg up on A. Mnskoday, favorite for
the final seven-furlong purse run, ar
rived late at the,, wire. Salable, the
mount of McÃride and 18 to 5 in the
ring, carried a heavy stable commis
sion, and led from start to finish. True
Wing, the contender all the way, ran
second. Alarie and the favorite were
third.
TRACK NOTES.
Treubel reached the wire first on
Schoolmate and Arabo, both horses
being from the stable of "Kansas"
Price.
There was considerable discussion
over the finish in the first race, many
thinking Sterling Towers reached the
wire first. As a matter of fact the
judges say The Volt won by a neck.
Frank Skinner, the form chart man,
called the mare first by the same dis
tance. â¢
It is refreshing to view a ride now
and then such as Jakie Jones deliv
ered himself of on Sir Preston. Then
when one sees a pretty piece of riding
it Is all the more appreciable.
George Wentworth bet "Kansas"
Price and Tobe Ramsey $80 that Sal
able would be in front of The Mist
turning into the stretch. What a great
State this is and how rapidly they
grow!

SOLACE ANNOUNCES HER
APPROACH BY WIRELESS
Naval Transport Comes From Asiatic Station
With Civilian and Service Passengers
Liner Alameda Ar
rives From Hono
lulu With Large
Number of Pas
sengers on Board
The navy transport Solace, crowded
with bluejackets and .marines from
the ships of the Asiatic station and
flying a home"ward-bound pennant, ar
rived yesterday from Manila several
hours after she had made wireless an
nouncement of her approach. The
wireless apparatus on the Solace was
Installed at Manila. It was sent to the
Orient for the use of, the Asiatic squad
ron and was Installed on board the
Rainbow. It was not a success and
the Rainbow landed the gear at the
Cavite navy yard, where it was turned
over to the Solace. Electrician T. A.
Scott soon had the wireless telegraph
in commission and ever since has oper
ated It with more or lesÃ success.
The Solace was talking to the oper
ator at Honolulu 150 miles on the
other Bide of the island port. It was
a Solace monologue, however, until the
transport was within fifty miles of
Honolulu. With the apparatus on the
it is more satisfactory to send
than to receive. The transport can
send about 200 miles, but all wireless
talk more than about seventy miles
distant falls on deaf ears as far as the
Solace's sound wave trap is concerned.
After leaving Honolulu the Solace
wireless machine refused to work and
there was no back talk after leaving
the island port. In the dark of early
yeeterday morning the Solace sent
forth dots and dashes for the benefit
of any wireless receiver that happened
to be within reach. When the Solace
was within sixty-five miles of the
heads she established wireless commu
nication with Goat Island, and from
then until the transport reached the
Quarantine grounds Operator Scott was
kept busy sending and receiving mes-
Commander J. H. Bull, in charge of
the Solace, notified his wife at the Oc
cidental Hotel of his approach and
asked her to come off with the Cus
tom-house officers when they boarded
the transport. Other officers sent pri
vate messages and Commander Bull
made a report of the voyage to Mare
Island. Incidentally Dennis O'Brien,
who operates the wireless for the Mar
coni Company at 412 Crossley build-
Ing, was in on all the conversation, the
Solace, like the Ohio, having served as
an alarm clock to rouse him from his
slumbers and take in the talk which
was astir on the morning atmosphere.
The Solace met the army transport
in mid-Pacific and the army transport
of the service supplied their naval
brothers with the latest mainland cur
rent literature. The navy transport's
voyage was uneventful. Fine weather
"was encountered all the way across the
Pacific and the quarantine officers
f<und all -on board In good health.
The Solace left Cavite February o, ar
rived at Guam February 10 and sailed
the following day. She reached Hono
lulu at 7 a, m. and sailed again at 10
p. m., February 21. She arrived off
the lightship yesterday morning at 11:55
o'clock.
The Solace brought 134 bluejackets
from the Asiatic squadron, thirteen
sick and twenty-four prisoners. Of
marines from the Far East she brought
fifteen enlisted men, fourteen sick and
five prisoners. Many of the bluejack
ets were from the Monadnock, and it
vas the time-expired men from the
Monadnock in whose honor and at
whose expense the long, rihbon-like
homeward-bound pennant was flying
from the transport's masthead.
The Solace brought passengers as

More Rumors of Sinking Schooner.
Rumor was busy yesterday with hints ' of
disaster tn the vicinity of Tomales Bay. The
fisherman who tt~ paid to have reported the
sinking of the Mary C. which <ii<in't sink,
flÃured largely* in yesterday's rumors, some
n which were of a startling nature. Hardly
had thÂ» day dawned than telephone bell; be
iran ringing: with the' burden of the news on
their wires, "The schooner Jessie j Madsen,
â wit), twelve men. on board, was teen by a
fisherman to go down with all hands." This
was the first rumor and it was being handed
around as a genuine ocean tragedy when the
owners of the schooner proved an alibi for
thelr^vessel. The Jessie was, safely tied up
t'i an Oakland -wharf and 'was in a part of
the creek where she couldn't sink if she
wanted to. No sooner was the Jessie story
punctured than- word came that the schooner
'Etta H. a full sister to the Jessie Madsen,
was- the cratt that had Rone to Davy Jones'
locker. Before the friends of the Etta B could
realize the calamity that had befallen their
deal ones came' a cable- from the Farallones
saying that the Etta B was lying in a snug
little cote under the lee of one of the islands
waiting for a tide which would help her home.
Other boats were suggested, but by dark
every one of the rumor-wrecked was accounted
.for. As far as is now definitely known the
only schooner in trouble â  was - the . Mary Etta,
â¢which drifted ashore Sunday at Stewarts Point
and whose crew stepiKrd on the beach when
the schooner ceased to float.
Three Overdue* Heard From.
The people who speculate In reinsurance and
who picked and "backed", the British bark
Stork as a probable arrival stand to make
generous gains from their investment. I The
Stork, bound from Hudson Bay for the British
capita] was quoted at 80 per cent. She left
Hudson Bay 163 days ago. She neither had
been heard from nor had arrived at London
tewn and as a consequence the reinsurance
ruled high. The high* rate attracted many
{â¢peculators Just because It was high and of
fered long odds in the event; of the vessel's
arrival. M. A. Newell, through whom the
reinsurance speculation at this pert is done,
received word yesterday that the Stork m
safe, . still in Hudson Bay, snugly wintering
under the *leÂ« of Charlton Island. Newell
also received a cablegram telling of the plight
of the steamship Tacoma. The Taeoma left
Seattle with a cargo of contraband for Vlad
lvostok. She Was quoted for reinsurance ; at
30 per cent. . The Taeoma, according to the
word received by Newell, Is frozen hard and
fast in the icepack off the Japanese coast.
With her is the steamer La'Pcrouse. The
Blackbraes, another overdue, quoted at .15 per
cent, reached her destination.: The other over
dues are quoted i, follow; : Francois, 15 per
cent; Brodlck Bay, 5 per cent, and Skidley,
90 per cent.
Liner Alameda Arrives.
The Oceanic Steamchip Company's liner Ala
meda., Captain Dowdell. arrived yesterday from

Club, which had also filed an applica
tion for the permit. According to long
establlshtd custom the Yosemite Club
was entitled to this month's permit, the
San Francisco Club having been grant
ed the January permit and .he Hayes
Valley Cub the one for February.
When Coffroth ascertained ir was on
the card:- to give the March permit to
the San Francisco Clu*. to the exclu
sion of the Yosemite Club, he appealed
to Mayor Schmitz. His Honor imme
diately sent for Morris Levy of the
Hayes Valley Club and Alec Ure^gains
of Ihr San Francisco Club. Tht-/ ap
peared at the Mayor's office last Mon
day at 1 o'clock and it is 3aid a scene
was enacted there. The Mayor de
clared the clubs must cease lighting
among themselves and wanteJ to
know vh> Levy and Greggaitio stood
in Coffioth's way. Levy took ac&sito
to say harsh things about Coifroih and
the discussion waxed so warm that
Levy threatened to throw up the light
ing gnrne. Finding he couVd not pre
vail uptn Levy and Greggalns to v/ltii
diaw in Coffroth's favor th<? Mayor
aent for Chairman Boxton of the Po
nc-t Committee. He received no satis
faction from the Supervisor. Thi;n the
Mayor told his lieutenant, Supervisor
Qallagr.er, to block the pa.ssage of the
resolution granting the permit to the
San Francisco Club, but Gallagher
failed at Monday's meeting 61 the
board to do so. In fact the resolution
was passed without any objection be
ing filed by any Supervisor, while Gal
lagher was communicating with â  the
Mayor over the telephone as to the
method of procedure is the matter.
When Gallagher came back to the
board's chambers he was surprised and
indignant that the permit had been
granted during his absence. He raised
the point that nothing was to have
been considered but the gas rate inves
tigation. Then Eggers suggested the
resolution be reconsidered, but Gal
lagher was wise to the fact that the
ten Democratic Supervisors had at
least two other votes in addition to
their own to beat any counter proposi
tion.
Now the resolution is in the hands
j of the Mayor, who may veto it, al
â  though he has not given any such mi
i timation. Harry Corbett of the Yo
1 sÂ«mite Club called on the Mayor yes
i terday and complained that he had
; been shut out on account of Coffroth,
i who is in disfavor with the Democratic
! Supervisors. Should the Mayor veto
i the resolution it will take fourteen
! votes to override his action.

CORBETT
. DEFEATED
NELSON
Continued From Page 10, ODlumn 4.
peared at Harry Corbetfs shortly be
fore 6 o'clock to go through the for
j mality of weighing in, Ellis street was
{ thronged with a surging mass of hu- j
manity.
When the time arrived for weighing '
there was the usual testing of the
j scales. When the boxers stripped Cor
! bett showed a vast improvement in his
i condition over ajiy previous time here. ;
Muscle had replaced the fat with which
his body had been larded in the past.
Nelson had to resort to the Hammam ;
baths during the afternoon to rid him
self of one obstinate pound of flesh
which would not yield to work on the i
road. He had a pinched look about
Urn body, which showed that the flf
; teen pounds above the required weight
; when he commenced training three
I weeks ago was hard to get rid of.
When Corbett stood on the scales
, the bar did not move, and it is sup- 1
posed he was a half pound under the
required weight.
When Nelson was weighed the bar !
balanced to a nicety. Indicating he was
j exactly at weight. Spider Kelly and
j Billy Nolan nearly came to blows over i
; Nelson's weight. Kelly claimed the
! boxers had a private agreement that if
j the bar raised when the scales indicat- '
j ed 130 pounds that It would mean the
j man was overweight. Harry Corbett,
: the official stakeholder, would not ac
i cept such a technical plea as th!s and
! declared both men at weight.
NELSON RULES FAVORITE.
.". â  â¢ â  â¢* â 
Remains a Strong Choice Through
out the Betting.
Nelson was a consistent 8 to 10 fa- t
vorite In the batting on the : fight al
most : from first to last. This is easy
to understand, as he defeated . Corbett
decisive^ Â«. at their first meeting and 1
then mafle a brilliant showing with
Britt. It was generally believed he
was fighting und%r a decided disad
vantage when he met the latter; as he '
was not allowed to fight : in his accus
tomed style. . * ,-':. " :
It was thought the racetrack contin
gent would send in its coin on Corbett
in such amounts as to make him fa
vorite. This money did not offset the
Nelson money, the price at the track
being 7 to 10.
There was some betting at â¢ even
money that Nelson would not stop Cor
bett in nineteen rounds.
Early in the evening the betting
went to 10 to 7%, and each Ijoxer had
a large following.
CURRAN OUTPOINTS DOLAN.
Caesar Attell Stores Mike Kelly Away
in Five Rounds.
George Curran and Billy Dolan, a
couple of lightweights, opened up the
night's fun with a six-round mill that
was brimming over with resounding
wallops, wild swings and footracing all
over the ring. Referee Jimmy Mc-
Devitt gave Curran the decision for
hia aggressiveness and cleverness.
<'urran brought a haymaker over on
Dolan's jaw in the second round, and
the latter rested on the carpet for
seven seconds. He came back willing
to mix and from that time on the mill
ing was fast.
Dolan was the stronger and was ;
there with an awful wallop which,
however, Curran managed to duck.
Dolan tried to finish his man in the
sixth rQund. but Curran countered each
time and sent in many mean jabs to :
the stomach.
Caesar Attell bobbed up again after
a long vacation and celebrated the oc
casion by stowing husky Mike Kelly
away in five rounds. Both men were
wild and erratic. Kelly was very foul
in his fighting and managed to earn the
hisses of the crowd.
Attell finished his man with a right :
to the jaw. Kelly was not entirely
knocked out. but when he hit the floor
the second time it looked awful good
to him and there he stayed.

In* with the best physicians and specialists
for the . past six years I called on Dr.
"Wong Him. He made a simple examlna-
â¢ tion by feelinn the pulse and explained my
case fully. I asked him If he could cum
it. He said yes. in from six to eight week 9,
which I can truthfully say he did. Th*
physicians here think him a wonder. Any
one writing me I will be only too glad and .
thankful to answer. I can cheerfully rec-
ommend him in - the very worst case* of
eczema, as my case was known to be one
of the most stubborn on record. TnÂ«
â  X-ray was also a failure. I think Or. .

him. Very truly,

ENDS HIS LIFE
TO SPITE WIFE
Xevadan Commits Suicide
to Prevent Spouse Get
ting a Decree of Divorce
TAKES CARBOLIC ACID
Family Troubles Due to
Poverty Prompt Rash Act
of Former San Franciscan
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, Feb. 28.â Eugene Lyhane
committed suicide in his room here
last night by taking a dose of carbolic
acid. The body was discovered this
afternoon.
Lyhane had been worrying for two
months past because of the fact that
his wife had entered a suit for divorce.
He often threatened his life, and once
before made an attempt, but was
caught in time to save his life. He
came here from San Francisco a year
or more ago with several thousand
dollars. The money went fast, and a
few months ago family troubles caused
his wife to leave him. Last night he
spent his last dollar for a bed aÂ«d his
last ten-cent piece for a drink ot
v.hisky. As he swallowed the liquid
he admitted the coin was all he had in
the world and started for bed. That
was the last seen of him alive.
Yesterday Lyhane stated that he was
determined that his wife would not
secure a decree divorce from him. The
case was set for hearing this week.
Rev. ML S. Levy Lectures.
In a lecture last night at the Young
Men's Hebrew Association the Rev.
M. S. Levy of the Geary-street temple
delivered a strong address In which
he showed why the Jew should not
follow Christian Science.'; The hall
was filled with an interested audience,
the speaker's remarks meeting j with
favor. Dr. Levy chose for his subject
"Christian Science As It Affects Jewish
Followers." He described -Christian
Science and urged that Jewish believ
ers have no need of the. new cult. . â¢

I publlo were disappointed at having bought
,' yesterday morning at the top level, only to
[ see them decline. There was in consequence
I a significant decrease in the outside demand
for stocks and an inclination by the out- '
siders to sell out holding?. The failure of
confirmation by official announcements of any
of the numerous reports recently circulated
begot a spirit, of timidity among buyers. This
was tiie most pronounced in prompting sell
ing on account of the large profits shown by
. the advances which the lately current rumors
I had caused. Many buyers were prompted to
I take oroflts offered rather than run the risk
i of the failure of reported projects to be con
' summatr-d. The shaky conditions of prices -
yesterday had the effect of inducing the plac
ing- of stop-loss orders to a, very large extent
I at prices below the current level as a pre
1 cautionary measure. In the recent feverish :
j condition â¢ of - the market brokers have been
inclined to Insist on this measure of pre
caution on the part of customers. This lii
vited aggression by the bears, which could be
pure to buy In and cover their shorts at a
profit if one* these stop-loss orders were un
covered. The action of the market showed very
plainly that raiding tactics . were, resorted to,
wide declines and .sudden -recoveries showing
I the taper haste to cover ehorts on the part
1 of the bears. ' Recent 'favorite's'-' -In the specu
| lation were;;: naturally most vulnerable, and (

Butter, Cheese and EggÂ».
The Butter market Is once mors practically
bare, both choice creameries and the cheajwr
grades' being cleaned up. The market is stiff
in consequence and tome houses arÂ« quoting
an advance, though the majority are disposed
to have trices where they are, for the mo
ment at least, as the north is taking the
goods at the quotations, and they are- afraid
that an advance will shut off this northern
business.
There was another cut m ranch Bggs. but
as was the case on the preceding day it did
no good, for nobody sold any more Eggs hi
consequence of it. Buyers continued to let
the market alone and all dealers complained
of the general dullness. Stocks continued ex
cessire.
Cheese Is cleaned up and firm.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruit*.
The Orange market is In excellent condition
for sellers, with all grades meeting with a
steady demand for local use. and prices are
higher all around. Stocks are comparatively
light and the smalt sizes, which have had the
most call of late, are closely cleaned up. Pick
ing in the southern growing districts has been
checked again by rain and receipts are ex
pected to be light for some days. Tb* other
Citrus fruits, particularly Tangerines, are
selling off well at good prices. All grades of
Apples are- moving freely at unchanged rates.

PRIVATE CAR
Thief 3lakes a Good Haul
Just as the Millionaire
Reaches City of Mexico
GETS AWAY WITH $1000
Californian and Party Are
Sightseeing on Rear Plat
form When Theft Occurs
Fayette S. Curtis of Boston, vice
president of the New York. New Haven
and Hartford Railroad, and a party of
friends arrived here yesterday in a pri
vate car and are staying at the St.
Francis. With Curtis are Edwin Mil
ner of Plalnfield, Conn., a director of
the road; J. K. Ryan, a prominent
contractor of New York, who was one
of the builders of ihe great New York
subway: Charles Fletcher, one of
Rhode Islands wealthy woolen goods
manufacturers, and Horace R. Handy,
a well-known business man of Prov
idence. The party left Boston several
weeks ago on a tour of Old Mexico and
the West and arrived here yesterday
direct from the southern republic.
The visitors brought from the City
of Mexico the news that Millionaire
James L. Flood and his party, Includ
ing his wife and children and Dr. and
Mrs. MarMonaple, had arrived there in
a private car. The day the Floods
reached the Mexican capital the mil
lionaire notified the police that his car
had been ransacked by thiÂ«ves and
robbed of flftuO in American currency
and various trinket* belonging to the
ladies of the party.
An inTestigation by the authorities
satisfied the California millionaire that
a stranger had gained entrance to the
car at a way station while the travelers
were assembled on the observation
platform at the rear end of the train.
Flood had placed the bills in a writ
ing desk in the forward part of the
car, axid it was apparent that the thief
simply had the good fortune to fall
upon them, for every drawer and shelf
in the forward part of the car had been
ransacked and articles were scattered
about the apartment. The thief made
his escape Just before the train to
whi^h the car was attached reached the
capital. The first intimation the Floods
received of their loss was when they
were returning to the interior of the
car to prepare for a trip through the
ciiy.
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
SEEKS PLEHX'S OPINION
Declines to Make Record on Consti-
tutional Amendment and Grade
Crossing Bill at Presrnd
Several matters of importance
came before a special meeting of the
trustees of the Chamber of Commerce
yesterday. The proposed amendment
to the constitution of California rel
ative to a change in the method of
taxation, the basis of the proposition
being the Lukens measure, was con
sidered. Professor Carl Plehn of the
University of California has expressed
himself In its favor. The trustees
would not put themselves on record
without further light. Accordingly
Professor Plehn was requested to
communicate his views in writing and
the matter will come up again at a
meeting soon to be Ufld.
The trustees also aeclined to take
sides relating to the grade crossing
bill that is pending in the Legislature
at Sacramento.
A committee was appointed to
meet Commissioner Bristow on his ar
rival from Panama and to extend to
him an invitation to use the rooms of
the chamber for the proposed hear
ings relative to the Panama Railroad
and Steamship line during his stay in
this city.
The chamber will soon begin to is
sue a monthly bulletin. President
Newhall says that it will do for the
commercial interests of the port the
same sort of work that the Merchants'
Association publication accomplishes
in regard to the municipal concerns
of San Francisco.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1905.
INCREASING
DEMAND FOR
BETTER CARS
Sutter-Street Improvement
Club Receives Support in
Its Battle for the Public
Right to (rood Service
UNITED RAILKOADS
OFFERS NO EXCUSES
Handsome Profits Made by
Corporation From Opera
tion of Antiquated Line
Do Not Lead to Liberality
The movement In favor of a better
street car service for San Francisco
lias assumed large proportions. The
sentiment of the people and the press
seems to be unanimous on the sub-
ject and the Board of Supervisors Is
inclined to give every assistance in Us
power to help the cause. The Sutter
Street Improvement Club is holding
out bravely for a conduit system on
Sntter street and branch roads, but
th<> I'nitcd Railroads is disinclined lo
listen to its arguments. The corpora
tion Is making immense profits on the
Suttor street system, but does not ap
pear to be willing to give a modem
underground wire service in exchange
for tile dollars that the traveling pub
lic is pouring into its coffers.
The United Railroads is preserving a
discreet silence in regard to its plans
to make of the Sutter street system of
cable roads an overhead electric nui-
Bance, or to maintain the hook and
eye line that bumps its weary way over
the Western Addition hills. The re
port was extant yesterday that the
company had arrived at the conclusion
that it would take the bit in its teeth, ;
figuratively speaking, and proceed re
gardless of public opinion.
The corporation hap determined that
it will make no effort to improve the
hook and eye line unless it makes the
Street Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors come to its milk. The Street
Committee does not propose to recom
mend the permit for stringing over
head wires, and the plan of citizens in
terested in the betterment of public
utilities in San Francisco is to look up
a law that will prevent the operation
of ancient cars and dummies under
conditions that are detrimental to pub
lic good and public safety.
BRALXHARTS ESTIMATES.
Supervisor Samuel Braunhart of the
Street Committee says that the value
of the Sutter street franchise is some
thing over two millions of dollars.
There is no section of the United Rail
roads system that has paid better than
the lines of the Polk, Larkin, Sutter
and Pacific avenue branches. While it
is not possible to get at the exact fig
ures it is estimated that on actual
property values the Sutter street road
and its branches pays about 18 per
cent per year. Of course, the hook and
eye line has been watered with the
rest of the United Railroads' stock.
But its cars are all in need of repair
and its dummies likewise ought to go
out of commission. The entire Sutter
street outfit is not worth in scrap iron
more than $100,000.
The Board of Supervisors has on file
an application for a permit to oper
ate a conduit road on Geary street and
Supervisor Braunhart is certain that if
the United Railroads feels that it can
not afford to make a modern line of the
Sutter street system, if it will place a
price on the line â even though it be
far in advance of what was paid for it
â there will be scores of bidders for the
chance to operate the system in a man
ner in keeping with the methods of
modern street car corporations.
The Sutter Street Improvement Club
has only commenced the fight for a
better car service. The club expects
to get the support of all sections of
the city that are neglected because of
the greed of the United Railroads for
nickels. The property owners in the
part of the city traveled by the Mc-
Allister cable system are said to be
grumbling at the poor service ren
dered. The cars are run far apart and
therefore are dangerously overcrowded
and uncomfortable by the time they
reach the downtown centers. The Va
lencia and Castro street systems are
equally bad and yet the corporation
stubbornly refuses to convert the Mar
ket street line and its feeders into a
conduit road. They have demanded
the overhead wire, as in the case of
the Sutter street lines.
EASTERNERS DISGUSTED.
The comment of Eastern people vis
iting San Francisco Is that the local
street car service, considering the im
| tiiehse revenues it returns on the,
I money invested is a disgrace to the
I city. Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland :
; and even Oakland have far better car
service than San Francisco.
Frank J. Sullivan, president of the
Sutter Street Improvement Club, is
: urging the members of the organiza
! tion to keep up the fight for a better
' car service in the intersecting section
: of the city traversed by the read. The
I Association for the Adornment and, Im
j-provement of San Francisco is endeav
oring to bring about a general clean
| ing up of the streets and a rearrange
! ment of avenues and boulevards. Mr.
! Sullivan, -with all Ynembers of the Sut
ter Street Improvement Club, thinks
that to allow an ug-ly overhead trojley
to penetrate the handsomest part of
town would be undoing the good work
that the association has begun.
Arthur D. McCann, who is one of
1 the most active of the Sutter Street
j Improvement Club members, says that ,
|in his opinion the. ednduit system j
|- would be of great 'benefit not only to
the traveling public, but to the rail- \
road company. Under present condi- '
tions persons residing Â®n Pacific ay- !
enue are given little if amy considera- I
tion by the t'nited Railroads.
Foreman Andrews Questioned.
Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury was called to testify in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday afternoon on
the motion of Chan Cheung to vacate
and set aside the indictment charging
him with the murder of Tom Tick of
the Chinese Educational Society. He
â¢was asked in regard to the reports of
the Grand Jury.as to alleged, bribery
in, Chinatown if the information on
which the reports .were based was
known to him prior to the filing of
the indictment- He replied in the af
firmative. The Judge intimated that
he would render his decision on the
motion on March 11 and he asked
that any further authorities be sub
mitted to him 'befor.e that date.
ROOSEVELT SAYS
TO GO AHEAD
President Thinks San Fran
cisco Should Have Rights
on the Tuolumne River
INTERVIEWED BY LONG
Chief Executive Directs
Revivals of Bills That
Were Shelved in Congress
City Attorney/ Long returned yester
day from an Eastern trip, during
which he had two interviews with
President Roosevelt in Washington, D.
Ci relative to the application of this
city for a grant of water rights on
the Tuolumne River and reservoir sites
on, Lake Elinor and in the Hetch
Hetchy Valley. The President ex
pressed great interest in the proposi
tion to acquire a water supply for San
Francisco.
The President appeared surprised
when Long informed him that the ap
plications for water rights had been
turned down by the Department of the
Interior and the bills introduced in
Congress and the United States Sen
ate hat# been shelved. Roosevelt at
once sent for Giffoni Pinchot of the
Bureau of Forestry in the I 'nit oil
States Geographical Survey, from
whom he, received full information re
garding the matter. Pinchot had re
ported in favor of the proposition, but
Secretary Hitchcock had opposed it.
The President told Long that it is the
duty of Congress to take action on the
application and requested Pinchot to
take steps to revive the bills in both
houses. The President also conferred
with Secretary of the Department of
Commerce and Labor Metcalf and ex-
San Francisco City Engineer Grunsky,
who is now Isthmian Canal Commis
sioner, and ascertained that Congress
man Needham is the only one of the
Congressional delegation from Cali
fornia who opposes the application in
the interest of Modesto and Turlock
irrigation districts. Pinchot will en
deavor to have Senator Perkins and
Congressman Kahn reintroduce their
bills, and the President's support, Long
says, is now assured.

WITTMAN'S
PROSPECTS
HOPELESS
Report Says Head of Chief
of Police 3lust Fall Now
That Mayor Has Failed to
Name a New Commissioner
TWO HOSTILE MEMBERS
HOLD DISMISSAL POWER
Board Hears Three Chinese
Gamblers (live Testimony
and Takes Adjournment to
Attend Fight at Pavilion
The fight at the pavilion interfered
with the progress of the trial of Chief
Wittman last night, for at 9:30 o'clock
the Police Commissioners suddenly an
nounced an adjournment to this even
ing. Only three witnesses were ex
amined, and these were Chinese who
gave testimony as to the existence of
gambling in Chinatown. Their credi
bility was shaken severely in the cross
examination, however, and it waH
made clear that personal enemies of
the suspended Chief had been active in
bringing the witnesses forward.
But the most important development
was the circulation of a story that all
hope for Wittman had been blasted.
He is doomed to lose his station at the
head of the department, it is said.
Commissioners Drinkhouse and Rea
gan will not yield in their animosity,
and their votes constitute a majority.
Dr. Poheim, the president of the
board, is understood to be favorable
to the Chief. He voted not guilty a
few nights ago in the case of three
patrolmen of the Chinatown squad, and
the evidence adduced against Witt
man is about the same.
The failure of Mayor Schmitz thus
far to appoint a Police Commissioner
to fill the vacancy caused by the re
moval of Hutton is regarded as having
sealed the fate of the Chief, whose
offense is that he did not stop the
fantan and lottery games in China
town. It had been expected that the
name of the fourth member of the
board would be given out last Monday
evening at 5 o'clock. Alexander
U'Grady, it was thought, would be the
man. The programme was that he
should take his seat that evening when
the trial of Wittman began.
HOPED FOR TIE VOTE.
Poheim and O'Grady were looked to
by the friends of Wittman as disposed
to be fair. Without a majority vote
the Chief could not be removed.
But there was no appointment of a
commissioner. Herbert Schmitz, the
Mayor's brother, is said to be clamor
ing for the job. And the trial of
Wittman, on charges of incofn
petency and neglect of duty, was
allowed to go ahead with three com
missioners, in which number Reagan
and Drinkhouse hold the power. It is
apparent from the manner In which
they are. conducting the trial that they
are keenly bent on making out a case
against the defendant.
An ugly report is abroad that Com
missioner Reagan is bitter in the
prosecution because Chier Wittman re
fused to promote yuung* Reagan, his
son, who was appointed a patrolman
some months ago, to a position in the
upper office as detective. The pay is
better and the duties easier. While
the charge is vouched for, Wittman re
fuses to be interviewed at the present
time and verification is lacking.
In the event of Wittman's dismissal
there will undoubtedly be a hot con
test in the courts. The Chief has a
stenographer employed to take all the
testimony adduced before the commis
sioners. It is contended that the com
missioners had no authority under the
charter to suspend him when the
charges were filed. Question is also
raised as to the right of the board to
prefer the charges and to act the part
sitting of prosecutor, whi)e at the same
time in judicial capacity. A Supreme
Court decision in a case that arose in
the Health Board is said to be parallel,
and holds that the accuser cannot sit
in judgment.
The commissioners instigated the
prosecution of Wittman by a formal

TRIAL. IS RESUMED..
The first witness last evening was H.
A. Duffield, who admitted that as
watchman in Chinatown he was em
ployed by the gambling clubs. He
testified that whenever Chief Wittman
started on a visit to Chinatown the
news was spread broadcast of his ap
proach as soon as he was seen in the
quarter.
Then came Joe Chew, Tee Shen and
Wong Lung, whom the commissioners
vouch for as highly respectable mem
bers of the so-called "English Educa
tional Society," while the defense in
sist that they are among the most
desperate of highbinders. The testi
mony of Shen particularly tended to
establish the latter contention. Two
weeks ago Sergeant Cook's squad raid
ed a gambling game in the headquar
ters erf the "Educational Society." The
witnesses admitted that they tcere
gamblers and that Attorney Carpenter
had talked with them of the case.
Joe Chew, in trying to testify against
the Chief, said that the police raided
a Ros3-aNey den in September, 1904.
At this time the injunction was in
force and the police were prohibited
from â  making raids.
Yee Shen likewise gave testimony as
to the prevalence of fantan and lot
tery playing. He said that money was
collected c"very week for police protec
tion and that the men who were ar
rested in the prearranged raids were
given *l fech to submit to the trip
to prison and the appearance in court,
all expenses being borne by the pro
prietors of the games.
In cross-examination. Congressman
Kahn demanded that the witness pro
duce his registration certificate. Yep
Phen became much confused. He re
fused and defiantly declared it to be
none of Kahn's business whether he
had a certificate or not. Then the
v.itness explained that the certificate
was in the possession of a friend. The
friend was in the. country looking for
work. Yee Shen did not know in what
part of the, country. Then he said the
certificate was in his friend's room and
that the room was in this city. The
room was locked, however, and the
friend in the country had the key.
Shen did not know the location of the
room.
"Isn't it a fact that you sneaked
into this country ?" demanded Kahn.
"That is none of your business," an
swered the Chinaman.
Wong Lung also told of the games
he had seen in operation in China
town. He was still on the stand whea
fight time arrived.
Sergeant Ellis and the five members
of his squad, who have been found
guilty of neglect of duty because they
failed to suppress the Chinatown
games, will come up for sentence at
tn-night's session of the commission.
The hour set for resuming the Witt
man trial is 9 o'clock.
