charged with bigamy in Chicago, and
who, it is alleged, married' more than
twenty women, was arretted at a
boarding-house in West Forty-seventh
street to-night by Central detec

though when first arrested he gave the
name of Henry Bartels. At the Forty
seventh-street station, whither he was
taken, he said:
1 am 710 I , *nd a muvb abused
man."
"How abused?" he was asked.
He had nothing to say. He gave his
name as John Joseph Adolph Hoch,
and said he was 45 years of age and a
machinist, living at 3430 Union avenue,
Chicago.
Hoch said that he had not been mar
ried twenty times. He asserted that
he had been married only twice and
that his first wife was still alive.
Mrs. Catherine Kimmerle, Hoch's
landlady, said he engaged board on
Saturday and had not been in the
house twenty minutes when he asked
to be allowed to peel some potatoes for
her. To-day he proposed marriage and
she then told the police. She added
that the man talked a good deal to her
yesterday and became much interested
in her, she bell^/ed.
In his room were found nearly -
dozen new suits of cloth..ig. In most
cases the tags, had been torn from
them, but those that had tags still on
them shewed that the garments had
been bought in Western cities, among
them Seattle.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30. â Senator
Bard to-day saw the President, to urge
the reappointment of Marshall B.
Woodworth as United States District
Attorney for the Northern District of
California. Before doing so he asked
Senators Perkins to join him in the re
quest, but the latter said he did not
think it proper that he should do ao,
inasmuch as it was ;>.n appointment the
term of which would extend through a
large portion of the term of Bard's
successor, and he therefore felt that
he should consult the latter before'
taking any action. He said, however,
that he would make no protest should
the President be disposed to make the
appointment.
Senator-elect Flint wrote to Senator
Perkins some days ago, asking that he
use his influence to have the appoint
ment held up for the time being, and
this letter Senator Perkins laid before
the President.
The term of office of District Attor
ney Woodworth expires on March 2.
Bard will be Senator until March 4,
and he insists that his voice should
hold good in such matters until that
day. Especially should it in this case,
he says, in view of the strong indorse
ment of his candidate which he has
filed and which includes most, if not
all, District and Circuit Judges.
Some time ago Luther G. Brown of
Los Angeles was a candidate to fill the
vacancy then existing as Assistant
United States Attorney under Wood
worth. His candidacy was championed
by Representative McLachlan. Sena
tor Bard refused to indorse Brown. So
did Woodworth. This, Senator Bard
thinks, is the reason for opposition to
the reappointment of Woodworth.
Robert T. Devlin of Sacramento, for
mer State Senator, is a candidate for
the place and in case Woodworth does
not get the appointment at once it is
understood that Devlin'will receive the
support of Senator Perkins. The Sena
ator says Woodworth is a candidate
for Judge of the Court of Claims and
was mentioned for the judgeship in the
new district pnposed to be created.
He refuses to indorse him as a candi
date for so many offices.

THE San Francisco CALL
FOUR men elected to the Senate of the Golden State have been accused of accepting a bribe from a corporation. These men are
Senators Wright, Emmons, French and Bunkers. Wright is from San Jose, Emmons from Bakersfleld and French and Bunkers
from San Francisco. Their accuser is William Corbin, secretary of the Continental Building and Loan Association, who was
haled before the Senate yesterday to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt for disobeying an order directing
him to appear before a Senate committee with the books of the corporation. Corbin defended his action by accusing the four
Senators, members of the committee appointed to investigate the Continental Building and Loan Association, of demanding through
an agent money from the corporation. Corbin further said that the investigation of his concern was the result of a conspiracy en
gineered by the San Francisco Examiner against Dr. Washington Dodge, Assessor of San Francisco and president of the corporation.
The four accused Senators declare they are innocent.
JURYMAN
PRAYS FOR
INSPIRATION
RENO, Jan. 30.âAfter being out six
ty-four hours while standing eleven for
conviction of murder in the second de
gree to one for acquittal, the jury in
the case of Al Linderman was dis
charged from custody to-day.
Linderman, with three companions,
was charged with murdering Jack
Welch on a freight train near Winne
mucca two y*?arÃ ago. About three
weeks ago his companions were found
guilty and sentenced to be hanged.
Linderman made several confessions
to the crime and his own admissions
placed him as much in the wrong as
the condemned men.
Despite the strong evidence, one
Juror held out from first to last for ac
quittal. His name is George Smith.
He claims that he received an inspira
tion from God that Linderman is in
nocent and voted accordingly.' Every
time his fellow jurors would plead
with him Smith would retire to a cor
ner and pray for a few minutes and re
turn with the announcement that the
divine power told him to stand firm.
Dinderman's case was transferred
here from Humboldt County on a
change of venue and his trial has al
ready cost that county a large sum of
money. His home is in Stockton, Cal.
He has a long criminal record, at one
time having been arrested in Fresno
County.

CITY OF MEXICO, Jan. 30.âThe

Streams of dark smoke are issuing

of a new crater which would permit
discharges of lava.

BY WILLIAM CORBIN, SECRETARY OF THE CONTINENTAL BUILDING
AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, OF ACCEPTING A BRIBE.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 30.âScandal,

Senate, at noon to-day. Senators Har

William Corbin, secretary of the Con- l

of the journey that lies between them

succeed in coming out free men.
This morning these four Senators
stood together as a court to determine
the merits of the charges against Wil
liam F. Corbin of the Continental
Building and Loan Association and its
other officers and agents, preferred
against them by the San Francisco Ex
aminer. To-night they stand shorn of
power, disgraced at least for the hour,
defending themselves against naked
charges of felony that if proved will
send them all to the penitentiary, bar

force that saves men worse than they
from the fate the law provides.

Defends His Client
by Making Charges
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 30.âThe climax
of a morning of busy discussion of the
merits of bills in the Senate came at
noon when William Corbin, in custody
of two assistant sersreants at arms,
was taken before the bar of the Senate.
"Mr. President," said one of the offi
cers, "Mr. Corbin is at the bar of the
Senate."
Corbin turned and swept his eyes
over the assemblage and for a moment
every one seemed confused. One of the
pages took in the situation, however,
and without waiting to find if his
course was proper, carried a chair up
to the desk and asked Corbin to be
seated. This relieved the strain and
the clerk, in obedience to the direction
of the chair, began to read the reason
under which the warrant for Corbin's
arrest was issued.
The reading of the resolution had just
been concluded when Corbin was
joined by his attorney, Frank D. Nicol,
who, in addition to practicing law, fills
the office of president of the First Na
tional Bank of Stockton.
Senator Selvage arose and moved
that Corbin ajnd his attorney be per
mitted the privileges of the floor. This
was granted and then Leavitt moved
that Corbin be called upon to give such
reasons as he could why he should not
be punished for contempt. Attorney
Nicol rose and said:
"Senators of California: Before the
sun sets to-day in the golden cup of the
West, I have reason to believe, the eyes
and ears of the State will be centered
here as they have not been before
since the session opened. William Cor

subpena heretofore issued by your
Committee on Commissions and Re
trenchments.
BIDING HIS TIME.
"He disobeyed this subpena ;>' the
direction of his counsel, and if his
counsel was in error, he meant no con
fession on his part that he did not
have full confidence in his ability to
maintain his honor in any investiga
tion that might arise. In disobeying
this subpena, he meant no disrespect,
no contempt, but he bided his time that
he might appear before the Senate sit
ting in general session and explain
his position.
"We maintain that this Senate has
no common law power, no nower to
issue processes or hale before it any
person or corporation it may wish un
der a blanket subpena. There are no
statutes that grant it such powers
they only exist by surmise. It would
be a manifest injustice to compel Mr.
Corbin and the association he repre
sents to bring two carloads of books to
Sacramento and suspend its business
while the committee investigated its
mode of business at its leisure. There
must be some specific proceeding upon
which the Legislature wishes to act
before its processes become effective
and this view is sustained by opinions
of many of the highest courts of the
land."
Nicol here quoted various authori
ties sustaining his position and then
proceeded:
"Why is Mr. Corbin here before the
bar of this Senate to-day? I dare say
there are few people in the State who
have not heard of the Continental
Building and Loan Association, of
which this respondent is secretary and
manager. It was organized in 1889
with a capital stock of $20,000,000, of
which $17,000,000 was subscribed and
$3,170,000 actually paid In. It has
erected 1900 homes in California and
has aided in the erection of 1600 more.
It has paid its stockholders more than
$2,500,000. Only recently it was under
special investigation of the Building
and Loan Commissioners, who de
clared the corporation to be absolutely
solvent and in a position to pay dollar
for dollar and more on Its liabilities.
CORBIX'S AFFIDAVIT. .
' Notwithstanding this fact, articles
have been published against all truth
that have alarmed 'those having inter
ests in the corporation. As you welt

Building and Loan Commission sits

Senate committee called the Committee on
Commissions and Retrenchments, on Thurs
day. January 26, 1905. at 2 o'clock p. m.
That previous to the service on him of said
subpena this affiant had been informed and
believed that the creation and Institution of
such committee had been at the suggestion of
tho fc'an Francisco Examiner; that the sugges
tion hid for its purpose the persecution of
Dr. Washington Dodge, Assessor of the city
and county, of San Francisco and president of
the Continental Building and Loan Associa
tion, who had given political offense to the
Examiner, and the persecution of this affiant.
That after the appointment of said commit
tee, four of the member* thereof, to wit:
Messrs. Bunkers, Emmons, Wright and French,
appointed an agent to act for said four per
sons for the purpose of blackmailing certain
corporations and collecting tribute from the
same. That during the week ending January
21, 11)05, the said French and Bunkers, to
gether with said agent, visited Ban Francisco
and the sai'i French and the said Bunkers
and said ag'-nt proceeded to attempt to col
lect sums of money, from said corpora
tions. That said Bunkers' and FÂ»eneh agreed
for themselves, and on behalf of said Wright
and Emmons, that whatever corporation would
.acceptable sum of money to said
Bunkers; French, Emmons and Wright would
either, not be examined at all or might pre
pare its own report. That said agent of said
Senators-made the statement that one of the
purposes of this committee was to assist the
Examiner In its attacks on Washington Dodge.
Said agent for saiii Senators further stated
that the Examiner had employed Emmons to
manage its plans in the committee and that
lient FI. Robert, agent of the Examiner, had
agieed that Eugene E. Schmitz, Mayor of
â¦ Ban Francisco, should give Bunkers a munici
pal appointment in San Francisco at a large
salary rrovlded he would do his utmost
against said Washington Dodge and the Ce?
tii-ental Building and Loan Association. Said
agent further stated that said Dent H. Robert
had said to Senator Bunkers that the Con
tinental Building and Loan Association muft'
be ruined at any cost. Said agent further
stated that the Examiner had settled with
Measra, Wright aad French- and had .further
agreed with said four Senators that arrange
ments made by them with other corporations
would nÂ«t be disturbed or attacked, - provided
the committee would . "do up" Dr. Dodge,
Corbin and the Continental Building and Loan
Association.
Raid agent further stated among other things
that certain Examiner reporters, among-them
Al Mlirphy. commonly known as "Blinker
Murphy," had l>een detailed by the Examiner
to -watch and assist said committee, but that
no fears need be entertained in dealing with
members of the committee of any exposures in
the Examiner. Affiant further deposes and
say? -that one day, the 23d day of January,
1900, there was sent from San Francisco to
Sacramento pursuant to agreement with said'
Bunkers. Emmons. French and Wright, and
their said agent, by divers persons and cor
porations large sums of money; that on Tuea-â¢
day. tho 24th day of January. 1905, a part of
said money was paid to said agent for his
p< fans! use and for his services- as agent for
eaid four Senators. The remainder of- said
money was divided into four parts; one-fourth
thereof was paid to said Bunkers, one-fourth
theredf to said Emmons, one-fourth thereof
to said French and one-fourth thereof to said
Wright. â  "

FRENCH DISPLAYS NERVE.
When he concluded reading this af
fidavit Nicol cat down, his usually
immobile features expressing in a
measure the satisfaction he must have
gained in the contemplation of the sen
sation : he had produced. For a moment
the accused Senators gazed at one an
other in amazement. French was the
first to regain his nerve, and, jumping
to his feet, he said:
"The alfidavit just read, so far as it
refers to me, I now wish to pronounce
an absolute falsehood, an unqualified
lie. There is not one word of truth
in it"
Senator Emmons next rose. His face
â was white as marble, but he controlled
himself as best he could and said:
"We seem to be getting away from
the issue here, but in view of the fact
that , these charges have been made
against me and my colleagues I desire
'Â« enter 'an emphatic denial to the
same. I don't know nor do I care
whence they emanate, but I will
say that the has been raised and
now is the time for the Senate to fully
investigate the charges that so seri
ously reflect upon the dignity of this
entire body. I am willing to abide by
the result of any investigation that
may be instituted as a result of this
affidavit."
fV-nator Emmons then drifted to the
law governing the issuance of the
original subpena directing Corbin to
appear before the committee of which
he is chairman, but he was interrupted
by Leavitt, who moved that a commit
tee of five be appointed to investigate
the authorities quoted by Attorney
Nicol to determine the question of the
right of the Senate to punish Corbin
for contempt.
WRIGHT ENTERS DENIAL.
Before the chair, could put the mo
tion, however. Wright took the floor
to enter his denial to Corbie's charges.
"That affidavit," he said, "is entirely
flatly and unqualifiedly false. There Is
not a word of truth in the affidavit, and
the only reason Corbin offers it is to
blackmail certain members of this
Senate. It is blackmail throughout
and only a flimsy pretext on his part
to escape Just punishment for his dis
obedience of the law."
This was the signal for Bunkers,
who, avoiding aiiy effort at oratory,
banged his fist on the desk and said'
"I want to deny the charge against me
and say that it is a darn He, and I
want .a committee of five appointed
right away to Investigate these
charges. That's Bunkers."
Notwithstanding the excitement under
which all were laboring. Bunkers'
strong emphasis on the adjective
"darn" caused a roar-of laughter, but
neither he nor his fellow defendants
joined in the hilarity.
At this point Keane addressed him
self to the chair on the question of the
law of contempt, but a motion by Bel
shaw that a committee of five be ap
pointed to investigate the charges
against the accused Senators took pre
cedence.
"I don't believe the Senate appre
ciates the enormity of the offense
charged against our colleagues," said
Belshaw. "It does not seem to realize
that we must act and act quickly "
Senator Curtln here interrupted arid
said: "It Is my opinion that theW

SENATOR'S ACCUSER, AN OFFICIAL OF THE CORPORATION AND FOUR MEMBERS OF THE SENATE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.
"CHARGES ARE ALL ROT,"
DECLARE THE ACCUSED
Say Accusations Were Made for Purpose
of Blocking Investigation.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 30.âThe ac
cused Senators refused to make any
extended statements in regard to the
charges against them. They pronounce
the accusations false, but go little be
yond that. They accused "the other
side" of trying to cover its own sins by
accusing them.
"Ihe charges are absolutely false,"
said Senator Emmons. "The allegation
in a San Francisco evening paper that
I took money at a certain place on X
street is untrue. No person has even
intimated to me that he had sufficient
interest in the matter to offer a bribe."
"The charges are all rot and I will
prove myself and all the others
charged with me innocent," said
riousness of this development is ap
parent to every one here. Bribery has
been charged in this affidavit, and this
body owes it to itself to determine
whether or not it is true. We should
immediately proceed and compel the
attendance of every one that knows
anything of this affair."
Leavitt then moved an adjournment
be taken until 2p. m. Before the chair
put the motion he appointed Curtin,
Selvage, Ward, Hahn and Simpson a
committee lo look into the question of
authorities on the contempt question.
Curtin asked to be excused, but tht."
chair held him to the appointment. An
adjournment was then taken.
Tifis was the signal for an inrush of
San Francisco Assemblymen, who sur
rounded the accused Senators, making
wild-eyed inquiries as to developments.
They were soon informed and as quick
ly walked ovtt into the corridor and to
the open air. leaving the accused to
their own thoughts.
PITY FOR ACCUSED.
The opening of the afternoon session
was' marked by a remarkable scene,
one that raised the pity of every man
that witnessed it for the chief actor.
Senator Emmons. He said since the
accusation of bribery had been made
against him he felt unclean, that he
felt dirty, and that it was his desire
to withdraw from the further delibera
tions of the Senate until such time aa
a full investigation had been had and
he had been proved guiltless.
"I will come at any time,"--he said,
"when it is necessary to make up a
quorum, but I do not feel that I can
remain here among my colleagues un
til I have been cleansed .of the charge
against me."
Senator Savage here Interposed and
said:
"Under the law of this land any per
son accused of wrongdoing is pre
sumed to be Innocent until proved
guilty. There is nothing in this affi
davit that to my mind casts even sus
picion upon the men accused. It is
their duty to stand upon their legal
rights and for one I object to having

the investigation that the other side
feared."
Bunkers essayed to treat the matter
with flippancy and wore a grin when
he stated his position.
"It is not Worth while to discuss the
thing." he said. "It is so palpably a
subterfuge that no one will give the
charges credence."
"I will repeat to you what I said to
the Senate," was Wright's reply when
asked for a statement. "The affidavit
is unqualifiedly false, and the only rea
son Corbin offered it was to blackmail
certain members .of the Senate into si
lence. This action is only a flimsy pre
text on Corbln's part to turn the
searchlight of investigation from him
self to those who would expose him."
Kern finds himself, but I see no good
reason why he should not participate
In our deliberations. I believe, with :
Senator Savage that every man is pre- j
sumed to be innocent until proved 1

men to be innocent. It would be a

his motion and remain in the Senate

Senator Carter here took up the ar
gument on behalf of Senator Emmons,
saying in part:
"I want to voice my sentiments in
this matter. I have known Senator
Emmons for years, and It would take
strong testimony, Indeed, to make tne"'
believe that he could be guilty of any
such offense as here charged, and I
ask that he remain here throughout
this Investigation."
WITHDPAWS STATEMENT. .
Emmons yielded to the argument of '
his friends and withdrew his state
ment. Neither of the others that
stand accused offered to withdraw
pending the inquiry Into the charges,
Emmons alone taking this stand,
which won him many sympathizers.
Senator Belshaw then Introduced his
resolution calling for the appointment
of a committee of five to Investigate

Anderson appointed Senators Belshaw

that do not enjoy the acquaintance of

the Identity of the alleged go-between
charged with having carried the bribe
money the affiant says was paid to
Senators Emmons, Wright, Bunkers
and French.
It was announced to-night that

tative of the San Francisco Evening

to. Jordan denies the allegation in no

further state and charge that the allegations

are part of a plan and conspiracy Instigated
by Fremont Older of the san Francisco Bul

In support of these assertions, I call atten- j

Mayor Schmitz at his residence last evening,

COMMITTEE REPORTS.
The committee. that had been ap
pointed by the chair to investigate the
question of the right of the Senate to
punish Corbin for contempt next re

therefore recommends that said William Corbin

Several of the Senators wanted to
know if the committee meant to say
that the Senate had no power to punish
for contempt or to issue legal subpenas
under any circumstances. Senator Sel

SPEEDY TRIAL ASKED
BY ALL CONCERNED
Work of Investigating the Charges
of Crookedness Is to Be Com
menced at Once.
Efforts may be made to-morrow to
secure warrants for the arrest of the
accused Senators. The constitution of
the State provides that members of
the Legislature shall in all cases ex
cept treason, felony and breach of the
peace be privileged from arrest. As
the acceptance of a bribe is a felony
warrants could be obtained upon a
proper showing.
Should the inquiry to be held by the
! special committee substantiate the
, charges made against the accused men,
, impeachment proceedings will be im
j mediately begun against them in the
Assembly. Should there appear ground
for impeachment, the cases will go to
the Senate, which must conduct all im
peachment trials, and the accused
member will be expelled from the trp
per house upon conviction.

CORBIN IS DISCHARGED.
There was no objection, and, accom
panied by his attorney, Corbin left the
Senate chamber. *
Ralston next took the floor and said
that he did not favor the abandonment
of the proposed investigation of the
Continental Building and Loan Asso

demands that it be carried through to
j the end. He asked that a committee of

"To stop now," said Curtin, "would
look like we were willing to stop, but
such is not the case. We want this

Wolfe agreed with Curtin that the

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 80.âWhen
Senator Belshaw, chairman of the
special committee of the Upper House
appointed to Investigate the charges
made In. tha affidavit read by Nicol,
called to order the meeting of that
committee held In the Supreme Court
chamber at the Capitol at 8 o'clock
to-night, the room was packed with
people directly or Indirectly interested
in the scandal. Belshaw said the spe
cial committee was ready to go ahead
with the investigation at once and find
out the truth or falsity of the charges.
Attorney Nicol asked for more time,
saying that it was not practicable to
proceed with such an Inquiry at so
short a notice. He asked until Wednes
day night. If such an Investigation
were to be had, he said, it was not the
proper thing to introduce the testimony
in incoherent form, but time should
be given to get all the testimony and
records together that a proper chain of
facts could be presented.
Senator Wright sprang to his feet
and said that while he did not fear an
investigation he felt it but right that if
the accusers of himself and the other
three members of the Committee on
Commissions and Retrenchment were
to be represented by a special prose
cutor the accused should also be given
time to consult counsel and prepare
their defense. He asked that the ln-
quiry be put off till to-morrow night.
"It is an inexpressible pity that such
accusations as these have to be made,"
said Attorney Nicol, the silence of
deepest attention falling upon his hear
ers as he spoke. "I wish to God that
I could feel they were untrue. I sub
mit, though, that if we start this in
quiry in a hurly-burly sort of way we
may get confused. Have the accused
men had time to go over the case* to
gether, to consult and hire attorneys to
represent them? Let them have time.
I am not here to act as a prosecutor.
I'll be glad If the committee will excuse
all attorneys from the case. This Is
a grave matter, one that every Senator
and every constituent of these Senators
is interested in. It will take until the
day after to-morrow to properly get
the testimony of the accusers in shape.
This evening will probably end my
connection with the case. I must be
In San Francisco to-morrow to attend
a trial. I think it eminently reasonable
that the hearing should go over until
the day after to-morrow."
"Is it impossible to get your wit
nesses here to-morrow evening?" asked
Belshaw. -
"I will not say that," replied Nicol.
"Mr. Corbin is here now and may be
sworn, so he will know he has to be
here and no further processes will be
needed to secure his attendance."
"The committee desires - to proceed
with all possible haste," said the chair
>man. "It wishes to purge the accused
Senators of the charge against them if
it is proven untrue. If not it wishes to
do whatever else is best as soon as pos
sible. As far as I am concerned, I am
willing to put off the hearing until to
morrow night. We should hold as
speedy a trial as possible."
"I have the same desire for a speedy
trial," said Nicol.
"It will be understood," continued
Belshaw, "that this committee is
neither prosecuting nor defending in
this matter."
Simpson made a motion that the de
fendants be given all the privileges of
representation by counsel and it was
carried.
Secretary Corbin of the Continental
Building and Loan Association was
sworn, and he said he would be here
whenever required. The twinkle in his
eye showed he deemed that he stood in
an entirely different position than he
had a few hours before.
"I wish to appear here for Senator
Emmons," said Attorney J. L Cope
land of San Francisco. "These ac
cused men should have time to consult
attorneys and learn what this is all
about."
"How much time do you want?"
asked Simpson.
"Till to-morrow night is a reasonable
time," replied the attorney. "I represent
Senator Emmons only, though. This
special committee was appointed one
hour after the affidavit of accusation
was read, and this meeting is being
held but four hours after the appoint
ment of the committee."
"Senator Emmons is not well to-night
and therefore is not present," said
French. "Now, if you want to do some
business tackle me right now, and I
don't" need any attorney, either."
No one paid attention to the invita
tion. - ~
Chairman Belshaw announced that
the inquiry would be postponed until
to-morrow evening at 8 o'clock and
asked all those who had witnesses they
wished subpenaed to leave the names.
It was stated that the Commissions
and Retrenchment Committee's Inves
tigation of the building and loan and
other Institutions that it had begun
would cease for the present.
Senator Keane stated on behalf of
Mayor Schmitz of San Francisco, who
has been called as a witness, that the
Major would arrive at any time his
presence was desired.

authorized the committee to proceed as
it did. I do not believe we should stop
at this time, but I do believe the in
vestigation of the Continental Build
ing and Loan Association should be
carried through to the end."
Leavitt moved that Senator Ralston
be delegated a committee of one to pre
pare a resolution for the appointment
of a committee of five to investigate
the Continental Association. â  The mo
tion carried and to-morrow a new com

DISASTER ADDS TO TROUBLES
OF EMPEROR AND QRAfID DUKES
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 80.âGeneral
Kuropatkln's attempt to break through
the Japanese left wing and outflank
Field Marshal Oyama's position on the
Shakhe River seems to have failed en
tirely. Few details have been received,
however, beyond the information con
tained in the official dispatches.
Field Marshal Oyama, aa at the bat
tle of the Shakhe River, appears to
have answered the Russian advance
with a counter offensive movement,
but no great disposition was shown to
carry the warfare into the territory
held by the Russians.
At the War Office there Is an inclina
tion to lay the chief blame for the fail
ure of the movement to a sudden
rhange of the weather to Intense cold
(20 degrees below zero) with a high
wind which drifted the snow and ren
dered it hazardous to expose the troops
to camping in the open plain, and also
impeded the transportation of guns,
supplies and the wounded.
The operation entrusted to the sec
ond army, under General Grlppenberg,
was the capture of Sandepas, which,
once in Russian hands, would serve as
a pivot for a flanking- movement
against Field Marshal Oyama; but
Sandepaa proved too hard a nut to
crack, and the Japanese, taking ad
vantage of the check of the Russians,
hurried up their reinforcements and
assumed the offensive on the Hun Riv
er, as well as along the railroad and
the Great Mandarin road. The Rus
sians, however, appear to have been
completely successful on the defensive,
repulsing all the Japanese attacks.
Under the circumstances, General
Grippenberg decided not to press the
attempt to storm Sandepas, which is
situated in a fiat country, and, there
fore, more difficult to take by assault
than a position in a hilly country.
Owing to the flat trajectory and the
enormous penetration of modern pro
jectiles, the capture of the outer line
of trenches on Thursday entailed
heavy casualties. There is no official
estimate of the losses, but it is ex
p ted that some thousands on both
sides were killed or wounded.
The news of this defeat, coming at
this time, is especially hard for the
< '.overnment. The popular idea con
tinues to be that the advance was un
d< (taken in order to divert attention
of the people from the events In Euro

ROME. Jan. SO.âGrand Duke Cyril,

IMPUGNS RUSSIA'S MOTIVES.
Japan Makes Strong Reply to Chinese
Neutrality Note.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 30.âThe Jap
anese Government has made verbal de
nial to the State Department here, and,
it is understood, to other Governments,
of the Russian charges of violation of
< hinese neutrality during the present
\ar. The Japanese statement, just
made public, is couched in strong lan
guage.
It says that while it is not Japan's
duty to defend China in this case, yet
i far as the good faith and loyalty of
Japan are called into question the
'iovernment of that country feels
bound to reply to the charges. These
;ire faken up seriatim, beginning with
Ihe Rveshitelni incident, which the
verbal rote dedans was nothing more
than the adoption by Japan of just and
inevitable measures of Self-defense
made necessary by Russia's violation
of Chinese neutrality. The charges
<hat <"hinese brigands were command
ed by Japanese officers and enrolled in
"heir army, and that Japanese military
Instructors were with the Chinese sol
on the border, are declared to be
without any foundation whatever, and

Russia is challenged to produce any
evidence in support of this charge.
It is denied that Japan has used the
Miatao Islands as a naval base, but It
is declared that Russia has so used the
islands and that a Japanese merchant
man was sunk in the island waters last
March by a Russian man-of-war. The
Japanese admit they have procured
war supplies from Chefu, but Insist
that these came through private par
ties and that the transactions were le
gitimate, while Russia, it is alleged,
has fitted out and loaded a ship In Chi
nese waters in flagrant violation of
Chinese neutrality.
Respecting the charge that China Is
seriously preparing to engage in the
war, the note says:
"It is difficult to Imagine how it
would be possible to frame charges
more mischievous or more remote from
actual facts than these. It is abund
antly clear that the motive of the Rus
sian Government in formulating base
less accusations was to relieve them-
selves of an engagement the terms or
which, with the progress of the war,
no longer inured mainly to their ad
vantage."
The note is supported by a detailed
statement under eight heads. Intended
to show wherein Russia on her part
has violated Chinese neutrality.

j Bill Discussed Changing Methods of
the Session.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 30.âThe pres
j ent Legislature intends to consider
with seriousness the revision of the
I constitutional amendment providing for
! the holding of the sessions of that body
and take the initial steps toward in
stituting the reforms deemed necessary
in this line. When Stanton's amend
ment to the constitutional provision
dealing with Legislative sessions came
up in its amended form in the Assem
bly this morning, as submitted by the
committee, the author objected to the
amendment providing that the total
daily expense of each House, aside
from the pay of the members, shall be
$450.
The bill as introduced by him provid
ed for an eighty-day session to begin,
as now,/on the first Monday of the
year, the pay of the member? to be 58
a day and the total expense to be $600

OYAMA LIKELY
TO FOLLOW UP
HIS VICTORY
Japanese Army Is Ex
pected to Take the
Aggressive.
âÂ« â
MUKDEN, Sunday, Jan. 29.âOfficial
published In the army news
paper show that the entire east wing
was undisturbed except by small scout
ing affrays during the fighting at Hei
koutai and Chenchiehpao. The army is
now working under the new organiza
tion and entirely new orders through
out, these affecting even the newspaper
correspondents most vigorously.
The creation of increased fortifica
tions in the center by both armies, re
sulting in both sides heaping their re
inforcements on their flanks, reaches a
point where that side falling behind
will slowly be forced to precipitate a
battle.
The present state of affairs Is appar
ently due to the clear, cold weather.
The Japanese have advanced every
available man to the front. It is re
ported that Liaoyang is deserted by sol
diers. The railroad south of Liaoyang
is strongly held, especially the bridges,
which the Cossacks report are unap
proachable on account of the armament
of the former Russian defenses and
the supplementary Japanese works.
In addition to Hclantai and Chen
chiehpao three other villages not im
portant were occupied by the Russians,
two of which have already been relin
quished.
More has been learned of the magni
tude of the Japanese strength opposite
the Russian offensive movement, and
as the Japanese appear disposed to
show their strength it probably will re
sult in the immediate restoration of the
original lines of defense, if not in a
Japanese aggressive movement.
The final reports give the losses at
Holantai and Chenchiehpao as less
than at first announced.
KCROPATKIN BAFFLED.
RUSSIAN HEADQUARTERS, Huan
Mountain, Sunday, Jan. 29.âThe object
of General Kuropatkin's latest offensive
movement was to capture the important
position at Sandepas. on the left bank
of the Hun River, and thereby outflank
the JaDanese from the Shakhe River
and enable the Russian army to under
take a general advance. At Sandepas
the Japanese occupied a strongly forti
fied position commanding the triangle
formed by the-confluence of the Hun
a .d Shakhe rivers. The Japanese had
erected a fort of a permanent type,
with triple earthworks and' trenches
extending In a southwesterly direction.
Several villages to the northeast also
were fortified. The positions were held
by twelve battalions of Japanese, part
ly drawn from General Nogl's army
and partly reserves.
The Russians carried the first line of
intrenchments. but were unable to
maintain their position on the out
skirts of Sapdepas. in the face of fierce
cannonading. The fighting was trans
ferred westward. The Japanese center
attacked with a brigade of infantry,
endeavoring to envelop the Russians,
but the cavalry protecting the Russian
flank drove back the Japanese with
heavy loss. A counter-attack on the
villages captured by the Russians at
the outset of the fight a4so was beaten
off. btft at the cost to the Russians of
several thousand killed or wounded.
Including General Mlstchenko, who
was wounded in the knee. The heav
iest sufferer* were the newly arrlvf-d
brigade of riflemen.
The official report oi the fighting at
Hounlitadzy and Hugounda on Jan
uary 25 and January 26 says forty-five
officers and 1050 men fell.
One hundred Japanese prisoners have
arrived here. â¢ They belonged to the
Ninth Division before Port Arthur.
The wounded are suffering from the
cold, which Is increasing.
RUSSIAN LOSSES HEAVY.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS. Friday, Jan. 29.âYesterday
(Saturday) afternoon the Japanese be
â ?an a fierce bombardment with artil
lery and musketry along the whole line.
The firing was kept up until midnight
and was resumed at dawn to-day, con
tinuing until noon. The Russian reply
was feeble.
A movement of the Japanese left
wing for the purpose of surrounding
and cutting off the Russians In the
neighborhood of Pokowtai is progress
ing slowly, as the resistance Is stub
born. Should the Russian force be cut
off it will result in leaving General
Kuropatkin's right flank unprotected.
Two divisions of Japanese troops at
tacked Pehowski and drove four di
visions of the Russians across the Hun
River. Six hundred Russians were
c aptured. The Russians are making a
stand across the river.
One Russian division made several
attacks on Santanpu, to the east, but
was driven back with a loss of more
than 4000 men.
The Japanese bombarded the entire
Russian line. The Russians replied
feebly, showing little activity.

ârÂ«
TOKIO, Jan. 30.âThe casualties dur
ing the fighting at Chenchiehpao and
Heikoutai are estimated at 5000 on the
side of the Japanese and 10,000 on the
Russian side.
Russian activity on the Shakhe River
seemed to have ceased after the fights
at Chenchiehpao, and Heikoupai, where
the Japanese were victorious. The ob
ject of the operations is not clearly
understood here, but it is suggested
that the Russians either intended to
turn the Japanese left and move a
heavy force down west of the Liao
River, or were seeking to divert atten
tion from some projected operation
against the Japanese right.
The Tokio press expresses the opin
ion that General Kuropatkin ordered
the movement either to divert attention
from the domestic conditions In Rus
sia, or that he had planned to make a
fight before Field Marshal Oyama
could be heavily reinforced. Manchur
ian army headquarters, telegraphing
yesterday, said:
"There has "been no great change in
the direction of the right and center
armies since the night of January 28,
except constant collisions between
reconnoitering parties. In the direction
of the left army the enemy keaps up a
slow but constant cannonade.
"The enemy's main body at Chen
chiehpao and Heikoutai seems to have
retreated in the direction of Neinyupao,
which Is two miles west of Changtan,
and Subfangtai. At a point ten miles
northwest of Shangtan, the enemy left
many dead. The details of the fighting
at Chenchiehpao and Heikoutai have
not yet been reported."
BOLD ADDRESS TO THE CZAR.
Noblemen Ask, Nicholas to Save the
Fatherland From Disaster.
LONDON, Jan. 31. âThe Daily Tel
egraph's St. Petersburg dispatches'
give the text of a remarkably bold ad
dress which has Just been voted al
most unanimously by the Provincial
Assembly of Kharkoff to Emperor
Nicholas, congratulating him on the
birt . of an heir to the throne and de
manding representative government.
'The signatories include marshals of
the nobility, noblemen and members
of the Zemstvo who were elected dur
ing the Incumbency of the Ministry of
the Interior of Yon Plehwe and who,
therefore, are presumably well dis
posed toward the autocracy.
The address refers to the horrors of
war, the military reverses and other
clouds hanging over the country, and
declares that "long years of bureau
cratic oppression and .violence, dis
franchisement of the people and vio
lation of the freedom of person,
thought and conscience have created
a condition of things that is no longer
endurable and which threatens a
storm already visible and fraught with
bloody civil war to the country and
the subversion of your throne."
It appeals to the Emperor to ward
off these calamities before it is too
late and no longer trust to negligent,
wily servants, but repose his confi
dence in chosen representatives of the
people convoked as a permanent
chamber endowed with legislative
powers and qualified to see that the
laws are not broken and that the
treasury Is not robbed.

WARSAW MOBS GIVE BATTLE
TO THE IMPERIAL SOLDIERS
Casualties of Single Night's Encounters in the Polish
City Estimated at One hundred and Sixty.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 30.âThe
day here was passed in perfect quiet.
There have been no manifestations of
terrorism. The report that a bomb
was thrown at the Governor General's
residence is unfounded.
Interest has been transferred entire
ly from St. Petersburg and Moscow to
Warsaw, Lodz and Labau, where a
state of siege has been proclaimed.
Warsaw Is the chief center of interest,
on account of the rioting there on Sun
day and Sunday night, In which at
least 1(50 persons were killed or wound
ed. The strikes continue unabated and
business is paralyzed, but there was
better order during to-day.
In Warsaw, however, the crisis is by
no means passed and there is great ap
prehension here with regard to what
the night may bring forth.
The public reprimand administered
to Deputy Chief of Police Roudneff of
Moscow on account of the posting ef
the anti-British telegram In this city,
has been delivered and in government
circles it is believed to be severe
enough to satisfy British opinion. It
is thought that this step, together with
circulating the reprimand in provincial
administrations, will prevent further
attacks or Insinuations against foreign
ers and will remove the incident from
the realm of diplomacy.
The Manufacturers' Association will
meet this week to decide the question
of paying the wages of the strikers for
the time the latter were not at work.
As a number of the works have al
ready paid their unskilled laborers,
whose pay day was January 28, one
half or full time, the rest of the em
ployers probably will decide to pay
their workmen at least part of their
wages for the time they were on strike.
At Kieff several of the big machine
shops and engineerir- works are idle
owing to the strike there and the bak
eries are partially closed with the re
sult that the price of bread has risen.
The military are patrolling the streets.
At Mitau there have been some disor
ders and a police superintendent was
wounded. The troops there have not
yet used their arms. A battery of
artillery and a battalion of troops have
been dispatched from Vilna to Llbau.
BOMB THROWING IN PARIS.
Two Guards Wounded and Prefect's
Life Imperiled.
PARIS. Jan. 30. âThe police early
to-day discovered a bomb in front of
the house of Prince Troubetskoy, an
attache of the Russian embassy here.
The policemen extinguished the light
ed fuse and informed the authorities,
who are investigating the affair.
The bomb was bottle-shaped and of
small dimensions. It was filled with
a green powder. There were two
tubes in the center, 'one of metal and
the other of glass, containing acid.
Owing to faulty construction the acid
could not have mixed with the pow
der and as it is the bomb could not
have done great damage.
A meeting was held this evening in
the Tivoll, Vauxhall. to protest against
the Russian autocracy. It was under
the auspices of the revolutionary So
cialistic group and 6000 persons were
present. Deputies Jaures, Vaillant
and De Pressenz spoke. The police
were in strong force outside.
During the exit of the audience into
the Avenue de la Republique a bomb
was thrown into the center of the
group of republican guards, in which
stood Prefect Lepine and other high
officials. None of these, was Injured,
but two guards were wounded and
many windows broken. The bomb was
loaded with big-headed boot nails.
Two men have been arrested, one
of them a law student, on the belief
that they were the authors of the
crime.
Several Russian and Polish exiles
among the orators at the meeting
used extremely violent language. Pro
fessor Trempoff, who was Father Go
pon's college professor, amid frantic
applause, showered eulogism on the
leader of the St. Petersburg strikers.
Deputy Jaures said the revolutionary
period had opened in Russia and
could close only with the end of im
perialism. The auditors shouted "To
the embassy."
When they were outside the hall
they sang revolutionary songs and en
deavored to break through the lines
of the police, who resisted. Then the
bomb was thrown. Two members of
the Republican Guard and three civil
ians were wounded.
SCORES OF RUSSIANS DROWNED.
Ice on River Gives Way While They
Are Fleeing I rom Troops.
BERLIN. Jan. 31.âTheVossische
Zeitung's Riga letter says the official
report of the number killed and
wounded in the riots there is far be
low the reported number, since it only
included those delivered to the hos
pitals, while unknown numbers lost
their lives by drowning.
When the soldiers fired upon the
crowd many rushed down the rocky
shore to escape across the river on the
ice. which broke, engulfing them. A
snow storm was prevailing at the"
time and the temperature sank rap
idly, causing the river to freeze over
again, and in consequence no bodies
have been recovered.
The movement, the letter says, has
taken on a distinctly political charac
ter, through the influence of inde
pendents, or those not belonging here.
These are Southern Russians, who
came to Riga under Government en
tourage to Russify the Polytechnic
Institute. They were * heard In the
streets shouting "The war must stop."
Down with the Czar," "Give us a con
stitution." "Long live revolution,"
"Hurrah for Japan!" A number of
Btudents were killed or wounded.

trie light plant has been destroyed by
striken,
LONDON, Jan. 31.âThe correspond
ent at Warsaw of the Daily Mall tele
graphs as follows:
"The street railway service here has |
been partly resumed, with soldiers rid- i
ing before and behind most of the cars, i
Few cabs are running. Street fighting 1
continues and the mob Is growing in j
dangerous fashion. There have been
frequent collisions between the people
and the soldiers. Revolutionists at- '
tacked the troops with revolvers and [
kmves. The principal disturbances to
day occurred in Noviswalt street, a
leading business thoroughfare.
TROOPS FIRE VOLLEYS.
"At 11 o'clock on Sunday night a reg
iment of infantry marched to this thor
oughfare from Smolna street, when
somebody fired upon It, whereupon the
troops were ordered to form a square
and fire from four sides.
"Any criticism of the troops must be
qualified by the fact that they are
fighting under trying conditions, being
constantly exposed to snipers and oc
casionally stabbed by passers-by. Gen
erally the troops are well behaved, but
sometimes there are excesses by Indi
vidual soldiers who have become in
toxicated. One such soldier killed two
children before his comrades were able
to disarm him.
"There have been many sad cases of
wholly Innocent persons shot accident
ally as . they turned street corners.
There are rumors that hundreds have
been killed in fighting in the suburban
towns; but I have personally Investi
gated every such report and learned
that there has been a comparatively
smalr death roll.
"Fighting was renewed this morning,
people firing from their houses upon
the troops.
"I cannot find a single shop un
harmed. All have been plundered and
most of them have been burned.
WOMEN OPPOSE SOLDIERS.
"A mob of desperate and hungry
women tried to thrust soldiers' bay
onets aside to get into a bakery. The
guard proved good natured and avoid
ed hurting the women. I am accus
tomed to the sight of misery, but the
haggard, starving wretchedness of
these women will haunt me to my dy
ing day.
"The troops and people had a little
pitched battle here before the military
rule was established. Even now the
slightest weakening of the military
would result in an immediate re
crudescence of violence.
"The situation on the whole has not
improved. The rioters avoid open con
flict, but seize every crpportuplty to
â¢wreak sly vengeance on the troops.
Many people are afraid to venture into
the streets, but young women or the ]
lower and middle classes court danger
in the worst disturbance, merely for
the love of excitement:
"Food is almost unprocurable and
bread is at famine prices. The am- !
balances are busy day and night. God j
help Warsaw!"

GREAT BRITAIN
AGAIN STIRRED
TO DEEP ANGER
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 30.âNew
complications between Great Britain
and Russia are feared on account of
the attack on the British Consul and
Vice Consul at Warsaw on Saturday
night. Coming on the heels of the
placards posted by Assistant Chief of
Police Roudneff at Moscow charging
Great Britain with Inciting the revolu
tion in Russia, the Warsaw incident is
likely to arouse an outburst in Great
Britain which may again strain rela
tions between the two countries. Be
yond the fact of the attack at Warsaw,
resulting in the wounding of the British
Vice Consul, who is now in a hospital,
the British embassy here has no details
of the affair, but Sir Charles Hardinge,
the British Embassador, has already
delivered a note to -Foreign Minister
Lamsdorff asking for an immediate In
vestigation and explanation, reserving
any claims which may be hereafter
made, and at the same time asking for
the protection of British Consuls
throughout the empire. By the first
train he also dispatched Major Napier,
the British military attache, to Warsaw
to obtain a full report on the circum
stances.
Count Lamsdorff replied to Embassa
dor Hardinge's second note on the sub
ject of the Moscow placards by saying
that instructions had been sent to re
move all traces of the placards from
*he streets. It la now learned, how
ever, that similar notices had been
posted at Libau and Reval, which led
to a renewal of representations on this
score.
HOLY SYNOD'S ALLEGATIONS.
In this connection the appearance of
the proclamation of the Holy Synod
Instructing the orthodox priests to in
form their parishioners that the strike
and revolutionary movements were pro
moted by the external as well as in
ternal enemies of Russia, with the ob
ject of embarrassing the military and
naval plans, has created something of
a flurry among foreigners here, espe
cially the British, who believe that the
object is to incite hostilities.
Most of the factories and mills of
St. Petersburg were in operation to
day and the strike, to all intents and
purposes, is ended. A few large estab
lishments have not yet fully resumed
operations,. owing to the official for
malities necessary in registering their
thousands qf employes. Some of the
workmen at the Poutiloff works, where
the strike originated, have asked for
the celebration of a religious service by
the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg be
fore resuming work, "so as to remove
the effect of the presence of the un
frocked priest and excommunicated
leader," Father Gopon. Some Social-
Democrats are protesting against the
arrests of Friday and Saturday, on the
ground that the action was in violation
of the implied promise contained in the
proclamation by the authorities.
ANTI-RUSSIAN OUTBURST.
LONDON. Jan. 30.âReports of
continued acts of hostility to Great
Britain and citizens of this country
In Russia are causing much perplexity
and anxiety In official circles In Lon
don. At the Foreign Office there is
evident apprehension of another pop
ular anti-Russian outburst here and
while diplomats say there is no doubt
that full satisfaction will be given for
j the Warsaw affair, the newspapers
; are unanimous in condemnation of
| Russia and attribute all incidents to
j anti-British sentiment.
At the Foreign Office to-day It was
j intimated that these accumulated evi
| dences of hostility, whether accident
lal or intentional, were causing mvÂ« h
i apprehension and that it would be
; necessary for the Russian Government
!to give full and prompt explanation,
!or otherwise popular sentiment In the
j United Kingdom might create a seri
| ous situation.
It was pointed out that while the
| injured pro-Consul at Warsaw, Mucu
i kaln, was merely an interpreter and
naval clerk in the consulate that fact
I made no difference and that it would
|be necessary to prove that the affair
| was not the result of the publication
lof the objectionable notices concern
ing which Embassador Hardinge al
j ready has protested officially.

IS AGAINST BEEF TRUST.
Decision Favors Contention of Government
.â â¢â, â
Injunction Granted bu the Lower Tribunal Re
straining Packers Made Permanent.
Special Dispatch to the Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 80.âJudge Grosscup. when informed of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States mak
ing permanent his injunction restraining the big packing companies from entering into a -ombination in viola-
tion of the Sherman anti-trust law, declared that he believed the action presaged a national movement for the
control and supervision by the nation of the great corporations of the future. Said he:
"The decision establishes the right of the Government to prevent combinations among the manufacturers of meats.
It fortifies the Sherman act. It is a long step In the direction of effectual Government supervision. But to my mind
the real significance of the decision is much deeper and far-reaching than even this. It effectively clears the decks for
what I believe will be the next really great national movement âas the restriction and Anally the abolition of slavery
was the last great fundamental movementâthe organization and supervision by the nation itself of the great corpora
tions of the future, a movement whose chief object will be, not so much to control prices, or merely to curb power, as
to bring corporate ownership within the reach and reasonable confidence of the people at large, and thus to repeople
lze and republlcanlze again the industrial ownership of the country."
Judge C. C. Kohlsaat of the United States District Court said:
"There never was any doubt in my mind that the Supreme Court would uphold Judge Grosscup's decision. It
seemed perfectly clear, and I don't believe that at any time there was another decision likely. This decision must be
highly pleasing to President Roosevelt, as it opens the road to great possibilities along the line of a cure for the so
called trust evil."
Attorneys for the big packers refused to make any comment as to what action would be taken on the decision un
til detailed Information as to the scope of the order reached them. John S. Miller, who acted as special counsel for the
packers In the proceedings, said:
"The order, as I understand it, simply makes permanent the Injunction restraining the packers from doing busi
ness in restraint of trade and in violation of the Sherman anti-trust law. They have assured me repeatedly that they
have done nothing in violation of these laws, hence a permanent restraining order does not In any manner inconvenience
them. It does not accuse them or convict them of any wrongdoing. The only thlng'that I see that could be done would
be to request a hearing of the case."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.âThe Su
preme Court of the United States to
day decided the case of the United
States vs. Swift & Co., known as the
beef trust case, charging a conspiracy
among the packers to fix prices on
fresh meats. The opinion was handed
down by Justice Holmes and affirmed
the decision of the court below, which
was against the packers.
In his opinion Justice Holmes dis
cussed at length the various conten
tions of the packers and disposed of
them Individually. He admitted that
some of the charges were less specific
than desirable, but said this was nec
essarily true on account of the vast
extent of the field covered. He added
that sufficient evidence had been
shown to prove continuous offenses and
an offense of such a nature to justify
the proceeding. The opinion continues
the injunction granted against the
packers under the Sherman anti-trust
law by tbe lower courts. The deci
sion was cuncurred in by all the mem
bers of the court. Summarizing the
bills, Justice Holmes said:
PURPOSES OF COMBINE.
"It charges a combination of a domi
nant proportion of the dealers in fresh
meats throughout the United States
not to bid against each other In the
livestock markets of the different
States, to bid up prices for a few days
in order to induce the cattlemen to
send their stock to the stock yards; to
fix prices at which they will sell, and
to that end to restrict shipments of
meat when necessary; to establish a
uniform rule of credit to dealers, and
to keep a blacklist; to make uniform
and improper charges for cartage, and
finally to get less than lawful rates
from the railroads to the exclusion of
competitors."
Referring to the allegation of lack of
continuity in the. charges, he said:
"Whatever may be thought concern
ing the proper construction of the stat
ute, a bill in equity is not to be read
and construed as an indictment would
have been read and* construed a hun
dred years ago, but it is to be taken to
mean what it fairly conveys to a dis
passionate reader by a fairly exact use
of English speech. Thus read, this bill
yeems to us intended to allege succes
sive elements of a single connected
scheme."
WITHIN REACH OF LAW.
He disposed of the c*harge of "multi
fariousness ' in the following language:
"The scheme, as a whole seems to us
te be within reach of the law. The
constituent elements, as we have stat
ed them, are enough to give to the
scheme a body, and, for all that we
can say, to accomplish it. Moreover,
whatever we may think of them sep
arately, when we take them up as dis
tinct charges they are alleged as ele
ments of the scheme. It is suggested
that the several acts charged are law
ful, and that Intent can make no dif
ference. But they are bound together
as the parts of a single plan. The plan
may make the parts unlawful. Intent
ia almost essential to such a convention
and Is essential to such an attempt.

Where acts are not sufficient In them
selves to produce a result which the
law seeks to preventâfor instance, the
monopolyâbut require further acts in
addition to the mere forces of nature
to bring that result to pass, an Intent
to bring to pass is necessary In order
to produce a dangerous probability that
it will happen."
TRAFFIC IS INTERSTATE.
He also said:
"The commission alleged embraces
restraint and monopoly of trade within
a single State, although its effect upon
commerce among the States is not ac
cident, secondary, remote or merely
probable."
Speaking further on the question of
Interference with interstate commerce,
Justice Holmes said that a charge was
made of a combination of independent
dealers to restrict the competition of
the agents who purchase stock for
them in the stock yards.
"The purchasers and their slaughter
ing establishments are," he said,
"largely in different States from those
of the stock yards, and the sellers of
the cattle, perhaps it is not too much
to assume, largely in different States
from either. The Intent of the com
bination is not merely to restrict com
petition among the parties, but, as we
have said, by force of the general al
legation at the end of the bill, to aid
in an attempt to monopolize commerce
among States.
"When cattle are sent for sale from I
a place in one State, with the ex
pectation that they will end their tran
sit after purchase in another, and
when in effect they do so, with the only
interruption necessary being to find a
purchaser at the stock yards, and when
this is a typical, constantly recurring
course, the current thus existing is a
current of commerce among the States,
and the purchase of the cattle is a part
and incident of such commerce."
With reference to the allegation that
no interstate commerce is involved In
the sale of meats by the packers. Jus- ,
tice Holmes said:
MAY PROHIBIT POOLING.
"The allegations of the second sec
tion, even if they import a technical
passage of title at the slaughtering
houses, also Import that the sale to
persons in other States and also that
the shipments to other States are part
of the transactionâ'pursuant to such
sales'âand the third section imports
that the same things which are sent to
agents are sold by them, and sufficient
ly Indicates that some, at least, of the
sales are of the original packages.
Moreover the sales are by persons In
one State to persons In another. But
we do not mean to imply that the rule
which marks the point at which State
taxation or regulation becomes permis
sible necessarily is beyond the scope
of Interference by Congress In cases
where such Interference Is deemed
necessary for the protection of com
merce among the Statee. Nor do we
mean to intimate that the statute un
der consideration is limited to that
point."
After referring in detail to the ob
jections to the original bill of com
plaint and disposing of all of them as
Insufficient, Justice Holmes said:
"The defendants cannot be ordered
to compete, but they properly can be
forbidden to g've directions or to make
agreements not to compete."
Suggestions looking to the modifica
tion of the, injunction were made as
follows:
"No objection waa made on the
ground that It Is not confined to the
places specified in the bill. It seems to
us, however, that it ought to act forth
more exactly transactlona on which
auch directiona, and agreements are
forbidden. The trade In fresh meat
referred to should be defined somewhat
as It Ib In the bill, and the sales of
stock should be confined to sales of
stock at the stockyards or that bought
at these yards for transport to another
State."
MOODY SPEAKS OF RULING.
In speaking of the Supreme Court
decision to-day Attorney General
Moody said:
"I was present In court when a
synopsis of the decision was stated
orally by Justice Holmes. There is
no impropriety In my saying that, as
I understand that statement, the opin
ion sustains In all respects the conten
tion of the Government and affirms
the decree of the court below in all sub
stantial particulars. The case decides
that the traffic in livestock transported
from the State or Territory,of its origin
to another State for sale and held there
for sale is Interstate commerce and
that those engaged in buying and sell
ing such livestock are engaged In inter
state commerce. This question has
been before the court twice before, but
was left undecided because the cases
in which It was presented turned upon
other considerations.
"The decision condemns as an un
lawful restraint of trade the combina
tion between Independent dealers to
suppress all competition in the pur
chase of livestock thus situated. It
condemns as an unlawful restraint of
trade the combination between such
dealers for the purpose of fixing: and
maintaining uniform prices In the sale
of meat throughout the country; it
condemns as an unlawful restraint of
trade the combination between such
dealers to obtain preferential rates for
Ahe transportation of their product by
common carriers. The decision makes
it clear that all combinations between
Independent individuals, partnerships
lor corporations engaged in Interstate
commerce by which competition be
tween them on sucn commerce is sup
pressed-fall under the prohibition of
the so-called anti-trust act."
The Attorney General declined to sa.v

RULING FAVORS HARRIMAN.
Supreme Conrt Grants Petition In the
Northern Securities Case.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.âThe Su
preme Court of the United States to
day granted the peptition for a writ
of certiorari in the case of E. H. Har
riman and others versus the Northern
Securities Company, growing out of
the former decision of the court rela
tive to the distribution of the stock
of the securities company. The ef
fect of granting the writ is to bring
the case to the Supreme Court for re
view. Argument is set for February
20 after other cases on the calendar
|on that day.
After the Government suit was de
cided against the merger, the securi
ties company decided to distribute the
stock of each of the two railroad com
panies among the stockholders pro
portionately, Instead of giving to each
one the stock originally deposited by
him as Harriman claims should have
been done. Harriman and his asso
ciates represent the Northern Pacific
stockholders and they represent $82,
--491,871 of stock. The present case
i was brought in the Circuit Court for
j the District of New Jersey, which
i granted an injunction against the
| securities company, prohibiting the
' disposal of the Northern Pacific Rail-
I road stock. The Circuit Court of Ap
peals reversed, that decision, and its
decision would haWVeW final, but for
the decision reached to-day to review
[ the case.

the case of Susan A. Ramsey vs. the

vorable to the land company and the

j ments taken from the Hepburn bill,
i The action of the committee was

j ticllly all day. At 10 o'clock the eleven

I two or more roads the commission, on
; the failure of the roads to agree on a
division of the rate, shall make a rul-
I ing on the matter, and the other ex

SCOPE OF THE MEASURE.
The bill as reported contains twenty
two sections. Sections one and two ex
tend authority to the Interstate Com
merce Commission, whenever after full
hearing it has declared any existing
rate for the transportation of persons
or preperty or any regulation or prac
tice whatsoever affecting the trans
portation of persons or property to be
unreasonable or unjustly discrimina
tory, to declare and order what shall
be a just and reasonable rate, practice
or regulation to be charged, imposed or
followed in the future In place of that
found to be unreasonable or unjustly
discriminatory, and the order of the
commission shall of its own force be
come operative thirty days after notice
has been given to the person or per
sons directly affected thereby; but at
' any time within sixty days from data
of such notice any persons directly af
fected by the order of the commission
and deeming It to be contrary to law
may institute proceedings In the Court
of Transportation, sitting as a court of
equity, to have it reviewed and its law
fulness, Justness or reasonableness de
termined.
When the rates substituted by the
commission shall be a Joint rate and
the carriers fail to agree on the ap
portionment thereof among themselves
within twenty days after notice of such
order, the commission after full hear
ing may issue a supplementary order
declaring the portion of such joint rate
to be received by each carrier party
thereto, which shall take effect of its
own force as part of the original or
der, subject to review like the original
I order.
Section 8 makes all proceedings be
- fore the commission, Including the rec
ord of evidence, findings and records of
the commission, a part of the record
in the case, to be sent to the court
of transportation within ten days after

Indications That the Other

mitted Into the Union
DATE FOE VOTE FIXED
; Oklahoma With Indian Ter
j ritory May Form One State
and New Mexico Another
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30â It Is by no
means certain how many new States
will be admitted to the Union under
the agreement reached to-day to vote
on the joint statehood bill and its nu
merous amendments on Febraury 7.
There are prospects, however, that
Oklahoma and Indian Territory will
come in as one State and that New
Mexico will come in as another, leav
ing Arizona as a Territory.
Senator Beveridge, chairman of the
Committee on Territories, who has
charge of the bill, concedes that in Its
present form there is no hope for its
passage. He says that his desire now
Is to give statehood to the million and
a half of people of Oklahoma and In
dian Territory at this time, and that
later Arizona and New Mexico will be
admitted as one State.
It is said that several members of
the Committee on Territories Intend, If
they fall to defeat amendments to the
bill, to support the Foraker amend
ment, which they believe would have
an effect contrary to that planned by
its author. The Foraker amendment
provides that either New Mexico or
Arizona " y a majority vote could de
feat the calling of a constitutional
convention of the Territories to provide
for their admission. Instead of requir
ing a majority of all the votes of both
Territories combined.
Members of the Territories Commit
tee are of the opinion that the people
of the Territories, even Arizona, when
face to face with a chance to come In
Jointly as one State or remain as Ter
ritories for an Indefinite period would
vote to come In as one State.

LONDON, Jan. 30.âAmericans doubt
less will recall the associations that
were formed several years ago, after
the discovery of a method of extracting
gold from sea water, and the derision
with which the idea was laughed out of
court. London folk now have an op
portunity to invest their money in such
an undertaking, through which, it is
averred, an unlimited supply of pre
cious metal can be obtained from sea
water at a cost of ten pounds for every
100 pounds extracted.
Sir William Ramsey, whose scientific
reputation is of the highest, has been
retained by a syndicate which Is called
the Industrial and Engineering Trust
(Limited) and the shareholders of
which include Lord Brassey, Lord
Tweeddale, the Hon. Allan Gibbs, sev
eral manufacturers and Albert Sande
mann, former Governor of the Bank of
England. The syndicate has a modest
capital of 3000 pounds In one-pound
shares. The Inventor of the process by
which it is hoped to make a corner in
the world's gold Is H. J. Snell. Sir
William Ramsay has made experi
ments, of which he says In an Informal
report that "there is no doubt Snell
has proved that gold can profitably be
obtained from sea water on a large
scale and the amount of gold obtained
is so large that whether the cost of
treatment is four pounds a ton or the
outside figure of eight pounds, which
It could not exceed, it would not make
very much difference."

NINE THOUSAND
FALSE BALLOTS
Most of Them Cast for Alva
Adams in Denver in the
Election of Last November
EXPEBTS MAKE EEPOET
If County Vote Is Thrown
Out Peabody Will Win the
Contest, Otherwise Not
DENVER, Jan. 30.âTen ballot boxes
were reported on by experts to-day In
the joint legislative committee hear
ing cf the FeaboJy-Adams guberna
torial contest. The experts alleged that
out of 3044 ballots 723 were written by
two or three persons.
Tho examination of ballots in this
county on behalf of Peabody has now
been completed, 104 ballot boxes having
been opened. The experts' reports
show that 29,141 votes were cast in
these 101 precincts, of which 19,161 were
for Adams and Â£.'3ll for Peabody. The
experts reported that 7808 of the Dem
ocratic and 1220 Republican ballots
were fraudulent, as they were written
by from one to four persons.
If the Legislature should grant the
original petition of former Governor
Peabody and throw out the entire vote
of all these precincts, Peabody's plu
rality in the State would be 76. If,
however, the Legislature should deduct
the ballots alleged to be fraudulent
from the good ones, Adams would still
have a plurality of 2156.
Six more ballot boxes will be report
ed on to-morrow. With this report the
contestant will have finished his case
before the committee. Wednesday aft
ernoon the attorneys for the con
testee will begin to introduce evidence.
In the trial of Peter Miller, an elec
tion judge, who served In Precinct 8 of
Ward 7, on the charge of fraud in con
nection with his conduct of the elec
tion, the ballot box was brought Into
the West Side Criminal Court and
opened to-day. The contents showed
nineteen straight Republican tickets,
twenty scratched tickets and 215
straight Democratic tickets. This cor
responds with the returns made to the
election commission. During to-day,
j however, sixty-two persons went on
the stand and swore that they were
residents of the precinct and voted the
' straight Republican ticket on Novem
ber 8. _
Miller is at present serving sentencf
in the County Jail for contempt of the
Supreme Court election Injunctive or
der. The ballot box opened to-day was
not used in evidence at the contempt
proceedings for the reason that attor
neys for the defense objected.

FOR THE GRAND JURY
Ach Unsparing in Arguing Injunction Suit
â¢Iâ âââ â  **" 4*
IN argument of the injunction suit involving 620 Jackson street, Attorney
â  Henry Ach roundly denounced the grand jurors yesterday for raiding that
and other places ot vice. He said that District Attorney Byington and the
jurors will have to answer suits for heavy damages for these acts, which he
declared to be unlawful.
The Grand Jury made a report yesterday morning on the police scandal,
setting forth that evidence of "gross corruption" in Chinatown was in its
possession.
The Police Commission was prevailed on last night to grant another
continuance in the case of Sergeant Ellis.
TRIAL OF ELLIS
AGAIN PUT OVER
Commissioners De
fer Reluctantly to
Grand Jury.
Once more in deference to the Grand
Jury the hearing of the charges
against Sergeant Ellis In connection
with the Chinatown scandal was post
poned by the Police Commissioners last
night. They were not In yielding mood,
however, and in fact had begun the
inquiry when they were prevailed on by
District Attorney Byington. who had
arrived meantime, to put the matter
over another week.
The request from Foreman Andrews
for another continuance came rein
forced this time with a letter of rec
ommendation from Judge Lawlor. yes
terday morning the Grand Jury* made
a report to the court wherein it was
set forth that the jurors had very im
portant Information in their possession
as to "gross corruption" in Chinatown,
involving several policemen, and that
the plans for going to the bottom of
the scandal would be frustrated if the
Police Commission proceeded with Its
investigation and forced the witnesses
to disclose their testimony. Confessions
of several policemen that they accept
ed money from the gambling gamea
had been made. It was said, and money
that had been passed in bribery was
in the Jury's possession.
Though the Grand Jury refrained
from specific statements, Judge < Law
lor regarded its general statement of
w hat it had done and what It might do
sufficient to Justify him In asking the
Police Commission to hold its, hands off
"in the interest of Justice."
JURORS "TOO INDEFINITE."
When the communication had been
read by Secretary Cadwallader and the
t nmrr.issioners had perused the Grand
Jury's report, Drinkhouse expressed
his opinion that there was "nothing
definite" In the mass of typewriting.
Chairman Poheim also thought the re
port of the Grand Jury was "too indef
inite." The Commissioners wanted
more of the "inside information" that
had not been divulged, for to them it
was not clear whether the public in
quisitors had evidence of any impor
tance or not. Furthermore, there was
no enlightenment as to how much more
time would be required by the Jurors.
"The report of the Grand Jury says
that several policemen have made con
fessions," spoke up Poheim, "and if
that is the case we want to know it.
If any policemen have confessed that
they accepted money from Chinatown
gambling games they ought to be dis
missed from the department. We have
been waiting five weeks now in defer
ence to the Grand Jury and it is about
time we know who those corrupt po
licemen are. They are all on duty still
as peace officers.
"I understand that the Gr:Â»nd Jury
has promised to save the men who
have confessed. I want to say that
this commission has not given the
Grand Jury authority to give any such
assurance, so far as standing in the
department is ' concerned. If any po
liceman Is found to have accepted mon
ey in Chinatown he will be discharged
from the force."
It was then decided unanimously by
Commissioners Poheim, Reagan and
Drinkhouse to proceed with the trial
of Sergeant Ellis on the charges that
ex-Commlssloner Hutton preferred sev
eral weeks ago. Hutton waa on hand
as a witness, having been eubpenaed.
The clerk read the accusations, which
were that Ellis permitted gambling in
Chinatown while in command of the
squad for that district, and that on the
night ot Hutton's secret visit to the
quarter for the purpose of inaugurat
ing a raid the sergeant had info-med
the fantan managers of his coming.
ELLIS PLEADS NOT GUILTY.
Ellis was asked his plea and he an
swered "not guilty." But he insisted
that he was not ready to go ahead with
the hearing, not having counsel, for the
Grand Jury and District Attorney By
ington had advised him that the com
mission would grant another postpone
ment.
But the Commissioners announced
themselves as wearied of the dllatori
ness of the Grand Jury- "They have
had five weeks now In which to prose
cute this matter," complained Chair
man Poheim. "They appear to have
made no headway and have been de
voting themselves to other things."
So the crestfallen sergeant, who
Foreman Andrews says, is deserving
of a measure of sympathy, was or
dered to take his seat as a defendant
before the bar of the commission.
Hutton was called and sworn. Chiel
Wittman proceeded as interrogator
Two preliminary questions as to namt
and former official position had beer
asked when District Attorney Bying
ton arrived. He urged that the ef
forts of the Grand Jury to expose cor
ruption should not be interfered with
would be done if the commlssior
eaat mined the witnesses.
Hutton suddenly spoke up with z
declaration that as the prosecutor ir
the case he ought to have something
to say, and he declared it would be al
together unfair to Sergeant Ellis tt
proceed without giving him opportun
ity to obtain counsel, now that it ap
peared that he had been misled as tc
a postponement. Hutton said som(
. ompllmentary things of Ellis' recorc
and made appeal in his behalf for i
continuance.
There was more whispering among
tlv Commissioners, rribre dfscuaalor
with Byiugton and then they changed
their former resolution and decider
to, give Ellis another week. Tho case?
against the other accused policemer
were put over to two weeks from lasi
night.

GROSSLY CORRUPT,
SAYS GRAND JURY
Partial Report Is
Made on Police
Scandal.
The Grand Jury made a partial re
port yesterday morning on Its investi
gations in the police scandal, and It
declares that "grcss corruption" ex
ists in Chinatown. The jury did not
enter Into particulars, but in a general
way it sets forth that it has much im
portant evidence going tc show that
the owners cf fantan games have paid
money for protection from police inter
ference.
The partial report was made because
It was feared that the Police Commis
sioners, before whom charires are
pending Involving a number of police
men, would go ahead last night with
the trial of Sergeant Ellis and by com
pelling the witnesses to testify reveal
the evidence that the public inquisitors
wish to have kept secret. .To have dis
closed it, the Jurors urged, would
make it impossible for tbem to go to
the bottom of the scandal as they hope
to do. The situation was presented to
Judge Lawior that he might also make
appeal to the commission and to
place the responsibility where it
would belong If the Grand Jury failed
to accomplish anything."
The report submitted by the Grand
Jury was that which had been made to
it by Chairman E. J. Bowes of the po
lice committee. This committee has
carried on all the probings and prowl
ings of Chinatown. The report recites
the history of the police investigation
from the beginning to the point where
it came virtually to a standstill about
three weeks ago. Its most salient para
graphs follow:
This committee has proceeded upon the as
sumption that Inasmuch as It was seeking to
expose the exact condition of affairs in tha
Police Department. Its activities would bo en
couraged and supported In every proper man
ner by the Police Board.
GROSS CORRUPTION EXISTS.
It may be repeated that to make a prema
ture disclosure of the evidence and Information
In the hands of this committee would not tend
toward the best results. The assurance la
hereby extended, however, that the committee
is in possession of evidence and Information
tending to establish the existence of a regu
larly organizd system of gross police corrup
tion In Chinatown; that the committee has in
Its possession bribe money which has actually
passed; that it has in its possession confes
sions of several police officials; that it has
evidence and information as to the exact
course pursued between the briber and the
bribed; that it has evidence and information as
to the specific amounts regularly paid, and
how such money was apportioned; and that it
has other valuable evidence and information.
While the committee does not deem it pru
dent to be more definite in its statement as to
the evidence and information before it, yet in
view of the apparently determined Intention to
proceed with the hearing of the said charires on
the evening of the 30th Inst, by the Board of
Police Commissioners, it is thought that this
much should at Isest be stated, so that if the
work of the Grand Jury be In any manner
crippled the responsibility may fall where It
belongs.
And while we are in possession of very Im
portant evidence and information, as already
indicated, such evidence and information does
at disclose the full extent to which the cor
ruption haa reached In official circles, and the
committee Is advised that In order to render
some of the evidence before It legally avail
able some additional corroborative proof is re
quired, and upon this phase of the matter the
committee Is at present engaged.
Now, in view of all this, the committee firm
ly believes that the prosecution of the formal
charges against these particular officers by
the Police Commissioners at this Juncture
might prove disastrous to the work thus far
accomplished, and In order to obviate any
such result It Is felt by the committee that
some action should be taken by this Grand
Jury aa a'body.
TO TAKE UP CORBIN MATTER.
The Grand Jury will meet this after
noon at 2 o'clock to make an Investiga
tion of the affairs of the Continental
Building and Loan Association, partic
ularly as to the reports that William
Corbin, secretary and manager of the
concern, has misappropriated large
sums of money.
"The charges that have been present
ed to the Legislature have been called
to our attention," said Foreman An
drews last evening, "and we have sub
penaed witnesses to learn whether
there Is any ground for criminal prose
\ cutlon. We shall go ahead independ
j ently of what occurs at Sacramento.
| We expect all the witnesses but Corbin
to be on hand, Including Dr. Washing
ton Dodge and Gavin McNab, who are
' officers of the association. The secre

LAWYER ACH AVERS
RAID IS LAWLESS
Says Grand Jurors
Must Not Pose
as Reformers.
The defense of 620 Jackson street,
battling to defeat by legal means the |
police efforts to suppress the notorious
resorts, resolved itself yesterday Into
the eloquence of Henry Ach, attorney. '
Judge Hebbard heard him, morning
and afternoon, not without pertinent
and caustic interruption by the court
and the District Attorney, and at the
end of the oratory the hearing was
continued until to-morrow. This was
because Ach has another engagement
to-day to appear as friend of the court
in Judge Cook's hearing of the con
tempt proceedings against the editor
and proprietor of the Bulletin.
If Ach's argument, bolstered by three
score and ten authorities ranging from
United States Supreme Court opinions
uown to the theories of obscure law
writers, is sustained by the court then
the District Attorney, the Grand Jury
and the Chief of Police have been ex
ceeding their authority in raiding im
moral places without "process of law"
and there will be some damage suits
forthcoming. Ach's arguments and au
thorities were also the pegs upon which
Attorney Nagle, present in court, hung
his hopes of defeating a like proposl- ,
tion to give the police exclusive Juris
diction In Belden place.
While, by order of the Judge, a law |
pcint only was at issue, Ach allow T ed
his ready tongue to tattle personalities
about Distinct Attorney Byington and ,
Grand Jurors Andrews and Bowes, who j
followed his talk with apparent in- j
terest.
"Why they are merely citizens in
the capacity they have attempted to
exercise in this matter," said the law- i
yer, "and they are subject to suit for
damages."
PROMISES DAMAGE SUIT.
"Why don't you sue," retorted By
ington, with a tone of challenge.
"Oh, you'll be sued all right, with a
delightful sufficiency, and every mem
ber of the Grand Jury will be a party
defendant," responded Ach.
When the proceedings began in the
morning, Ach offered a score or more
of affidavits in behalf of his client, Se
bastian Ravani, keeper of the cigar
store at the entrance to 620 Jackson
street. One was the affidavit of the
restaurant keeper in the building, who
said that his trade had dropped off $40
a day since the beginning of police ac
tivity in the neighborhood and that he
"never asked his customers whether
they were typewriters or dishwashers
or followed some other profession." All
the affiants had something to say about
the acts of the police in intimidating
"customers" since the granting of the
preliminary Injunction.
Judge Hebbard declined to admit the
affidavits and announced that he would
close the evidence upon the motion to
dissolve the Injunction on the affidavits
originally submitted. This shut out the
oral evidence which Attorney Max
Kuhl said he would demand in behalf
of the Police Department. .
"I will further announce," said the
court, "that from a careful considera
tion of the affidavits I must find that
the premises about the cigar store are
used for purposes of prostitution. This
leaves the primary and ultimate issue
of the case dependent upon the law as
to the authority of the police, Grand
Jury, or any officer or citizen to go
upon the premises without the consent
of those who occupy them, peaceably,
or using force of arms and breaking
open doors and so entering and making
arrests without authority of law. It is
one thing to moralize upon these ques
tions; It is one thing to criticize courts
and Judges; it is another thing for the
courts and Judges to apply the U.w.
This is what this court will do."
RAIDS AND EXTORTION.
Hia limitations thus ordered, Ach be
gan. At first he read in full a New
York opinion on a like case which re
flected upon reformers and discussed at
length "so called raids as an efficient
means to effect extortion by the po
lice." When he had done Judge Heb
bard expressed the wish that he should
read no more of his authorities in full
merely cite them. In the course of his
multifarious citations Ach did lvell by
the court's instructions, barring his
| own digressions upon the conclusions
ito be drawn.
i When he reached a discussion of the
! statutory provision that a policeman
: has no right to arrest without warrant
! unless the offense is committed in his
1 presence, Mr. Byington interrupted
I him. Said the District Attorney "Are
i you willing to take an injunction pre
i venting the police from interfering with
i the cigar store, but permitting them to
: p"ass through and behind it into the
I building?"
j Scornfully Ravani's attorney meas
! ured the public's lawyer with his gaze.
I"I am not bargaining with trespassers
j and lawbreakers; I am seeking to pro
tect the plaintiffs in this case. The
Police Department commits these un
lawful acts and then asks counsel to
agree that it shall do the very things
complained of. This man's business is
almost ruined by the policemen, who
stand in front of his place and Intimi
date his customers by their mere pres
ence."
| Byington asked if Ach could honest
!ly say that the police had threatened
i Ravani's cigar store, and Ach replied
| that the matter was set out in twenty
three affidavits, and if Byington did not
. believe them he could have the affiants
I indicted for perjury. "I would have
I them indicted if they testified to those
, things upon the stand," said the Dis
' trlct Attorney, whereupon Ach vouched
for the truth of all the affidavits, say

WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.-âThe rec

partment. He was tried by court
martial at Fort Lawton, Wash., on
three charges covering about forty
specifications and involving serious in
fractions of the army regulations, in
cluding duplication of pay accounts,
failure to pay debts, breaking pledges
to abstain from drinking liquor and
financial irregularities In various parts

NO RIGHT TO INTERFERE.
Ach said the police or the Grand Jury
had no more right to interfere with his
client's cigar stand than they would
have to prevent a doctor or dentist who
sought such trade from establishing an
office there or to prevent their patients
from entering.
Concentrating his attention upon the
grand Jurors, Ach declaimed: "The*-- are
not the monitors of the citizens San
Francisco. The Grand Jury was not
impaneled to find out if an immoral re
sort was kept in one place or another,
and If it were It would be bound bv the
law. When the jurors are not In ses
sion at their meeting place to look after
matters in their province they are
merely common citizens. If one of them
dared enter my home or place of busi
ness, as they have in this case, he
would suffer the consequences person
ally to the utmost. The same applies
to the District Attorney; he is a public
servant employed to represent the peo
ple in certain places, and no person,
the District Attorney, the grand jurors,
magistrate or policeman, has the power
to enter the premises of any owner
against the owner's protest without
process of law."
Ach argued the question of illegal ar
rests'âthe mere telling of a man to stop
or "move on," as applied to the acts
in front of the cigar store. Judge Heb
bard interrupted this discussion, and
said that the point to be decided was
w hether or not the police had authority
to enter any premises without a war
rant.
Byington declared that there was
no authority in equity jurisdiction to
prevent a police officer from making an
arrest, even though the arrest were il
legal. Judge Hebbard replied that he
and other Judges had decided that an
Injunction would He in such case?
where property rights were involved
and he did not propose to permit any
argument on the point. The District
Attorney, however, insisted that he had
had the right to ftrgue in the Supreme
Court that the- court's upon a
point in a murder case had been ill
advised and he thought he had the
same right to make a like showing in
j the Superior Court. "It seems to me."
he said, "that the people cannot be de
barred in any case fn>m citing their
; authorities. We should b<* permitted
! to make an argument to prove that
I you have been in error."
"SUPPOSE HE HAD KILLED."
Ach resumed. He referred to.'the "ar
' rogant and ofttin-.es brutal breaches of
j the law made by those employed to
! keep the peace, and in citing the case
of his other client. Edward Moran, a
male lodger at 620 Jackson street. Into
whose rooms the police effected an en
[ trance with sledge hammers," he said:
"Suppose he had killed Mr. Byington,
j or Mr. Andrews, cr the Chief of Po
| lice, who entered his apartments in
: this manner without any warrant for
his arrest and no demand fcr admlt
' tance in the name of the law. Is there
' a Magistrate in the community whi
would have held him for the homicide"?
If we can't get relief from this way ol
doing things by the police there is go
1 lng to be an Insurrection in this city.'
"We are ready to meet it," quoth
Byington.
i "Oh, you are pandering to the news
; papers," said Ach disdainfully.
"No. I'm pandering to the moral ele
! ment of this city." replied the Districl
i Attorney without heat.
Ach became more contemptuous
j "What dictionary of the law has en-
I larged your duties to those of a re
i former? You remind me of one Hut
! ton and the adage that 'He who lives
in glass houses should never throv\
j stones.' " Then the taunt and rejoindei
I about the damage suit came out anc
A( h proceeded to another lambasting
\ of the Grand Jury, in which he re
i ferred to "John Doe" Andrews anc
"Richard Roe" Bowes. He thoughl
| that he would have as much right tt
j stop a real estate agent from collecting
! rents on houses of ill-fame as thÂ«
grand jurors had to stop the custom oi
his cigar dealer. If he were Chief ol
i Police he would have no more regarc
for the orders of Byington and An
drews than he would for those ol
Henry Ach.
GOVERNMENT MOST CONTROL
RAILWAYS, SAYS PRESIDENT
If Necessary He Will Advocate
Constitutional Amendment
to Make It Possible.
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 30âPresi- ,
dent Roosevelt was the guest of honor j
and principal speaker to-night at the
forty-second anniversary banquet of ]
the Union League. The President came |
to this city over the Pennsylvania road
front Annapolis, where he attended
the exercises this afternoon incident to
the graduation of the senior class of
cadets.
An immense throng greeted Roose
velt at the railroad station, and he re
ceived an ovation on his way to the
Union League Club. At the Clubhouse
he passed through two lines of cheer
ing members to the reception room,
where from 6:15 to 7 o'clock he stood
and shook hands with several hundred
prominent citizens.
The First Troop, Philadelphia City
Cavalry, acted as the President's es
cort while he remained in the city.
When President Roosevelt rose to
make his address he was greeted with
long continued applause. Then the en
thusiastic, assembly stood and sang
"The Star Spangled Banner," accom
panied by the First Regiment band.
President Roosevelt In his address
said:
LINCOLN AS A GUIDE.
"This club was founded tc uphold the
hands of Abraham Lincoln when he i
stood as the great leader In the struggle ;
for union and liberfy. We have a right j
therefore to appeal to this club for aid |
in every governmental or social effort |
made along the lines marked out by j
Lincoln. The great President' taught
many lessons which we who come after
him should learn. Among the most
important of these was the lesson that
for weal or for woe we are indissolubly
bound together, in whatever part of the
country we live, whatever our social
standing, whatever our wealth or our
poverty, whatever form of mental or
physical activity our life work may as
sume.
"Lincoln, who was, more emphatic
ally than any other President we have
ever had, the President of the plain
people, was yet as far removed as
Washington himself from the slightest ;
taint of demagogy. With his usual far- j
sighted clearness of vision he saw that
in a republic such as ours permanent
prosperity or any part of our people
was conditioned upon the prosperity of
all. and that, on the other hand, any
effort to raise the general level of hap
piness by striking at the well-being of
a portion of the people could not but be
In the end disastrous to all.
FEDERAL SUPERVISION.
"The principles which Lincoln applied
to the solution of the problems of his
day are those which we must apply if
we expect successfully to solve the dif
ferent problems of our own dayâprob
lems which are so largely industrial.
"Unquestionably, however, the great
development of Industrialism means
that there must be an increase in the
supervision exercised by the Govern
ment over business enterprises. This
supervision should not take the form of i
violent and 111-advised Interference, and
assuredly there is danger lest it take ,
such fctrm if the business leaders of the
business community confine themselves
to trying to thwart the effort at regu
lation instead of guiding it aright. Such
men as the members of this club should !
lead In the effort to secure proper su- j
pervislon and regulation of corporate
activity by the Government, not only
because it is for the interest of the
community as a whole that there
should be this supervision and regula
tion, but because in the long run it will
be in ttye interest above all of the very
people who often betray alarm and
anger when the proposition is first
made.
STATE ACTION INADEQUATE.
"Neither this people nor any other
free people will permanently tolerate
the use of the vast power conferred by
vast wealth, and especially by
-wealth In its corporate form, without
hedging somewhere in the Government
the still higher power of seeing that
this power, in addition to being used
in the irterest of the individual or In
dividuals possessing it, is also used for
and not against the interests of the
people as a whole. Our pecuUar form
of government, a Government in which
the nation is sapreme throughout the
Union in certain respects, while each
of nearly half a hundred States is su
preme in its part of the Union in cer
tain other respects, renders the task
of dealing with these conditions es
pecially difficult. No finally satisfac
tory result can be expected from mere
ly State action. The action must come
through the Federal Government. The
business of the country is now carried |
on in a way of which the founders of j
our constitution could by no possibil'ty j
have any idea.
MAY AMEND CONSTITUTION.
"All great business concerns are en- I
gaged in interstate commerce, and it I
was beyond question the intention of !
the founders of our Government that
interstate commerce in all its branches
and aspects should be under national |
and not State control. If the courts I
dec ide that this intention was not car- j
ried out and made effective In the con- '
stitution as it now .stands, then in the ,
end the constitution, if not construed
difl'erenily. will have to be amended
so that the original undoubted inten- j
tion may be made effective. But, of !
course, a constitutional amendment is !
only to be used as a last resort, if
every effort of legislation and admin
istration shall have been proved In
adequate.
"Meanwhile the men in public life
and the men who direct the great busi
ness interests of the country should
work not in antagonism out in har
mony toward this given end. In en
tering a field where the progress must
of necessity be so largely experimental
it is essentia! that the effort to make
progress should be tentative and cau
tious. WÂ«i must grow by evolution, not
by revolution. There must be no
hurry, but there must also be no halt:
and those who are anxious that there
should be no sudden and violent
changes must remember that precisely
these sudden and violent changes will
be rendered likely if we refuse to make
the needed changes in cautious and
moderate manner.
MIST#INCREASE POWER.
"At the present moment the greatest
need is for an increase in the power of
the national Government to keep the
great highways of commerce open alike
to all on reasonable and equitable
terms. Less than a century ago these
highways were still, as they had been
since the dawn of history, either wa
terways, natural or .artificial, or else
ordinary roads for wheel vehicles
drawn by animal power. The railroad,
which was utterly unknown when our
Government was formed and when the
great principles of our jurisprudence
were laid down, has now become al
most everywhere the most important,
and, in many large regions, the only
form of highway for commerce. The
man who controls its use can not be
permitted to control it in his own in
terest alone.
â¢'Every Important railroad is engaged
In interstate commerce. Therefore,
this control over the railroads must
pome through the national Govern
ment.
"The control must be exercised by
some governmental tribunal, and it
must be real and effective. Doubtless
there will be risk that occasionally, if
an unfit Piesident is elected, this con
trol will be abused; but this is only
another way of saying that any ade
quate governmental power, from the
power of taxation down, can and will
be abused if the wrong men get con
trol of It.
DETAILS FOR CONGRESS.
"The details must rest with the law
makers of the two houses of Congress,
but about the principle there can be no
doubt. Hasty or vindictive action
would merely work damage; but in
temperate, resolute fashion, there must
be lodged in some tribunal the power
over rates, and especially over rebates
âwhether secured by means of private
cars, of private tracks, in the form of
damages, or commissions, or in any
other mannerâwhich will protect alike
the railroad and the shipper and put
the big shipper and the little shipper
on an equal footing. Doubtless no law
would accomplish all that enthusiasts
hope; there Is always disappointment
over the results of such a law among
the over-sanguine, but very real and
marked good has come from the legis
lation and administration of the last
few years; and now, as part of a co
herent plan, it is entirely possible, an?l,
indeed, necessary, to enact an addi
tional law which will mean further
progress along the same lines of defi
nite achievement in the direction of
securing fair dealing as between man
and man.
"In some such body, as the Interstate
Commerce Commission tnere must be
lodged in effective shape the power to
see that every shipper who uses the
railroads and every man who owns or
manages a railroad shall on the one
hand be given justice and on the other
hand be required to do justice. Justice
âso far as it Is humanly possible to
give and to get justiceâis the founda
tion of our Government. We are not
trying to strike down the rich man;
on the contrary, we will not tolerate
any attack upon his rights. We are
not trying to gfve an improper advan
tage to the poor man because he is
poor, to the man of small means be
cause he has not larger means; but we
are striving to see that the man of
small means, has exactly as good a
chance, so far as we can obtain it for
him, as the man of larger means: that
there shall be equality of opportunity
for the one as for the other.
"We do not intend that this republic
shall ever fail as Ahose republics of
olden time failed, inVhich there finally
came to be a government by classes,
which resulted either in the poor plun
dering the rich or in tne rich exploit
Ing and in one form or another en
| slaving the poor; for either event
i means the destruction of free institu
! tions and of individual liberty. Ours is
| not a Government which recognizes
t classes. It is based on the recognition
of the individual. We are not for the
I poor man as such, nor for the rich man
as such. We are for every man, rich
!or poor, provided he acts justly and
j fairly by his fellows, and if he so acts
the Government must do all it can to
see that inasmuch as he does no wrong,
so he shall suffer no wrong.
TALKS TO THE CADETS.
ANNAPOLIS, Jan. 30.âThe Presi
dent delivered the commencement ad
dress to the graduating class of the
Naval Academy to-day. The exercises
were in the new armory, which was
well filled with the midshipmen, the
officers of the academy and their rela
tives and friends. Although speaking
directly to the graduating class of the
Naval Academy, the President spoke
to the nation, as well as to the mid
shipmen. Addressing the cadets as
"fellow midshipmen," the President
began by saying that he was unable
to see how a good American could fail
to be a better American by coming to
Annapolis and seeing what the navy
was and svhat it was soon to b?.
"More than any other people in the
country." he said, "except the men of
your sister service, you owe a peculiar
care for your interests to the repre
sentatives of the people.
NO DANGER OF MILITARISM.
"Of all'the baseless alarms in the
j country," the President said, "the cry
! about militarism was the most foolish
i and most baseless.
"No nation ie as free from the dan-
I ger of a grow th of militarism as we
; are, â¢ ?ie added. ' The danger is lest

DETROIT, Jan. 30. âSpecials to the
Tribune announce that Samuel Bidd
son of 42 Broadway, New York City,
has started a movement to determine
the ownership of certain lands in
Muskegon County, Mich., which lies
along the shores of Lake Michigan
and part of whlfjh has made its ap
pearance because of the receding of
the waters of the lake.
These shores have not been mean
dered by the United States engineers
for sixty-eight years and Biddson and
his wife have laid claim to 30.000
acres. They have, given a quitclaim
deed of this property to the United
States Mill and Lumber Company of
Washington, D. C, In order to bring
the question to an issue. The deed
was registered in Muskegon County.
A Muskegon correspondent of the

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
FANTAN PLAYERS
CROSS THE BAY.
A CHINESE PARKHURST
UNIVERSITY STUDENT MAKES CHARGES
BERKELEY, Jan. 30.âSensational
allegations regarding the prevalence
of gambling in Berkeley, involv
ing the office of Marshal Kerns,
are contained in a report made to Jus
tice Edgar to-day by T. Y. Chang, a
Chinese student of the University of
California. Chang discovered ten days
ago that the Chinese gamblers who
have been under cover in San Fran
cisco had crossed the bay, some coming
to Alameda and some to Berkeley. He
decided to Investigate a la Parkhurst,
and alone made a tour of the gambling
houses in Berkeley last Saturday
night.
Chang reports that two fantan
games were found by him, each run
ning in full blast, with from ten to
twenty players at each game. He en
tered the gambling houses, which are
situated on Dwight way, between Ful
ton street and Shattuck avenue, with
out molestation, and for thirty min
utes watched the Orientals gathered
around the gambling board engage in
the fascinating game that the law for
bids to be played.
In the course of his investigations
Chang learned that the Chinese have
assured themselves that police inter
ference need not be expected. They
say the authorities have been "taken
care of" in the manner customary with
those seeking to procure immunity
from arrest. The student says he was
informed by a Chinese whose name he
does not know that Marshal Kerns has
been paid $20 a week to leave the gam
bling games alone.
MARSHAL DENIES CHARGE.
â¢This report Ib denounced by Marshal
Kerns as "the wildest, weirdest lie that
ever came from the lips of a white or
yellow man." Kerns is indignant that
In any way his name should be used by
gossiping Chinese and declares that he
will see that the gamblers get all the
"protection" they have paid for, ex
plaining that to-night deputy marshals
will be stationed at the doors of
the resorts visited by the young uni- 1
versity student and that fantan games !

Marshal Kerns hints that his political
enemies have induced or Inspired the
Chinese student to stir up the matter
and visit the gambling dens, expecting
to use the result in the coming political
fight in Berkeley; in which the mar
shal's office is one of the plums to be
fought for.
'.T have a small force with which to
keep the peace In Berkeley, and yet I
think my record is an honorable one,
and that the department Is efficient,"
said Kerns to-day. "If there has been
fantan playing, it was done without
my knowledge, of course. Wherever I
hear of such work, you may be certain
that I will suppress it instantly. The
talk of my receiving money from Chin
ese for protection is absolutely foolish
and untrue."
Chang, who is a freshman student in
the college of agriculture, says he was
not Induced by any person to make his
investigations. He had heard of the
fantan gambling and to satisfy his
own curiosity decided to see what was
being done by his speculative country
men. Chang is about 23 years old, and
has been In California twenty years
He is intelligent, speaks English well

he saw.
KNEW IT WAS FANTAN.
"The fantan games were running in
the building adjoining the laundry on
Dwight way, near Shattuck avenue,"
he said. "Ong Quin Olu was conduct
ing them, I was told. When I went in
they stopped for a minute. Inspected
me, and then proceeded, after asking
me what I wanted. I-qaid I wanted to
see the game. They thought I would
play, I guess. There were from twen
ty to thirty men in each place. Not
all gambled at the same time. I did
not engage in the game. I know it
was fantan, for I have seen the game
played in Chinatown in San Francisco.
There were no white men or boys at
these games In Berkeley. The players
were Chinese of the ordinary class. The
sums gambled for were from $1 to $5,
and the money changed hands pretty
rapidly."
Justice Edgar, to whom the univer
sity youth made his report, waa in
doubt what to do under the circum
stances and telephoned to District At
torney Allen for advice. The latter
suggested that a raid be made and the
gambling apparatus be secured, when
arrests were made.
Marshal Kerns consulted with Jus
tice Edgar and instead of preparing for
a raid said his men would be stationed
to-night at the gambling resorts on
Dwight way, to stop the games. Deputy
Marshal Howard is to be in charge of
the deputies commissioned to drive out
the fantan players.

BOMBARDMENT
OF CIRCULARS
Oakland's Political Battle
Ends With a Contest of the
Types and Printers' Ink
FIGHTS IN MANY WARDS
All Kinds of Documents Are
Issued by the Partisans of
the Republican Factions
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ 1016 Broadway, Jan. 30.
On the eve of the general municipal
primaries for the city of- Oakland the
mails are overladen and messenger
boys are borne down with loads of cir
culars and literature from all sides.
The campaign just closing has been
one of letters and documents rather
than of newspaper work, and there has
been no end of both letters and docu
ments.
The last assault made to-day was
upon the stand E. Randolph
on the water question. Some days ago
Mr. Randolph issued a statement in
which he said: "I believe the Council
of the city was justified in submitting
to the voters their proposition to bond
the city for the acquisition of the Bay
Cities Water Company." To-night there
was issued a copy of the referendum
card that was sent by Mr. Randolph
to the general water committee when
that committee submitted the Bay Cit
ies proposition and the Niles cone prop
osition to the people. Mr. Randolph's
card declared that he was in favor of
neither proposition, and a photographic
copy of his signed card has been is
sued.
Another deal of circulars was made
by City Auditor A. H. Breed, who is a
candidate for re-election. He issued a
circular letter to-day to his friends in
the Fifth Ward asking them to sup
port the Mol ticket. This letter Is very
strong and declares positively for Mr.
Mott for Mayor. This letter has brought
a reply from Felton Taylor, present
City Treasurer, who seeks a renom
ination, in which Mr. Taylor resents
Mr. Breed's efforts in Mb ward, and
says that his delegatiorr has always
been pledged to Mr. Breed and he sees
no reason for Breed's trying to dictate
the affairs of the Fifth Ward.
While there is a bombardment of cir
culars in the Fifth Ward, there is also
another bombardment of the same kind
going on in the Seventh Ward. When
Councilman J. T. Wallace was ignored
on the "regular Republican ticket" of
that ward he turned into the camp of
R. H. Chamberlain, who seeks the Re
publican nomination for Mayor. A com
mittee of Seventh Ward citizens, com
posed of John Yule, Clinton Q. Dodge,
Charles E. Cornell and George H. Ma
son, issued a circular, In which they
said:. VX et because..Mx., Wallace would
not submit to being' dictated to by a
few politicians who claim to rule the
Seventh Ward, and who had nothing
but their own selfish interests to pro
mote, they have combined to # defeat
him for re-election."
This circular was answered to-night
by Supervisor H. D. Rowe In a state
ment declaring that J. T. Wallace is a
Democrat, and not a Republican, and
takes to task every man who signed
the Wallace circular with the exception
of John Yule, and says that they all
have some ax to grind and some po
litical place to seek.
Aside from these newly issued politi
cal circulars there has been no particu
lar change In the political situation as
announced in The Call this morning.
The fights are confined exclusively to
the Republican party. There are no
contests in the Municipal League or
among the Democrats or Socialists, and
there will be hardly a handful of votes
cast by these parties. The issues are
all joined, and only the casting of the
ballots to-morrow remains.

an engineer, is haunted by a Nemesis

BIG HOSPITAL
TO BE BUILT
Trustees of Fund Left by the
Late Catherine Garcelon
Get Leave to Go Ahead
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 30.
Permission was granted to-day by
Judge S. P. Hall to the trustees of the
Samuel Merritt Hospital fund to
begin work on the big enter
prise provided for by the will of
the late Catherine Garcelon, who be
queathed property worth $750,000 for
the erection of a free hospital for In
curables. Owing to complications and
the fact that much of the property left
by the deceased is real estate not read
ily disposed of, the project for which
the means were left has been delayed
since 1891.
In a showing made before the court
this morning Trustees Dr. Peter L.
Wheeler, Dr. A. J. Russell and Willfam
B. Bosley said that these difficulties In
the way of beginning the great work
would not be removed in many years,
as much of the realty was valuable as
reslde|kre property only, and would
have* TO await customers in order to
get its market value. They therefore
believe it was expedient to begin the
work by the erection of one ward to be
followed by three others as the money
comes in.
By the provision of the will the trus
tees must keep 1800,000 on hand as a
perpetual fund for the malntena. "Â»e of
the hospital. They now have money
and property to the value of over $600,
--000 and purpose to expend nearly $100,
--000 in beginning the buildings, which,
it is calculated, will cost $250,000 when
complete. There was no opposition to
the petition of the trustees, the State
being represented by Deputy Attorney
General R. C. Van Fleet, and the for
mal order was made forthwith. It is
stated that by early sprang active work
in the erection of the first buildings
will be under way.

MOTHER GOOSE
Mrs. Genevieve Parkhurst
Says Her Father Was Like
Girl in Nursery Rhyme
IS QUICK AT REPARTEE
Witness Has Sharp Answers
for Questions Propounded
by Attorney D. M. Delmas
"My father was like the litttle girl
who had a little curl way down in
the middle of her forehead. When he
was good he was very, very good, but
when he was bad he was horrid."
This parody, chanted in the tone of
a kindergarten teacher, was given by
Mrs. Genevieve Parkhurst yesterday
in Judge Kerrigan's court in reply to
Attorney Delmas' question, "Was your
father a good father to-you?"
The reply disconcerted the urbane
and self-possessed attorney.
"Was he a good father to you or
not?" persisted Delmas.
"Well, he always gave us enough to
eat," replied the witness, "but he was
not the sort of father I should want
my little girl to have. I don't think
he was a good father."
Mrs. Parkhurst's indignation was
raised when Deimas thus questioned
her concerning her marriage: "You
were married in January by a Justice
of the Peace and In August there was
a second ceremony performed by a
Catholic priest, was there not?"
"If you want to know anything
about my marriage, write to my hus
band in Honolulu," retorted the wit
ness quickly.
But Delmas persisted and Mrs.
Parkhurst admitted that such was the
case.
In a graphic manner the daughfr
described an incident tending to prove
that Yoell was insane. He was swear
ing at Mrs. Yoell, the second wife, de
clared Mrs. Parkhurst. The daugh
ter turned on him suddenly, saying,
"Don't you dare talk about my mother
that way."
"Then," declared Mrs. Parkhurst.
Hp came at me. crying that he would
â¢ hoke me and cut my heart out. I
took hold of him and said, 'You won't
( hoke me and you won't cut my heart
out. Just try it if you dare.' He
quieted down and walked out of the
room like a little lamb."
The witness said she had read fh a
magazine that insane people could be
< ..wed. "I tried it and it worked very
well," she added.
A letter from Mrs. Parkhurst to her
father, telling him that she had been
married secretly was read and placed
or. record. "My father objected to
Milas," explained Mrs. Parkhurst, "be
cause he was a Catholic and had no
money.'' Letters from the witness to
Mrs. Evaline Levy and her daughter,
in which Mrs. Parkhurst entreats
Mrs. Levy to come to San Jose, were
read. Attorneys Delmas and Rix got
into a controversy over the reading of
ilepositions from witnesses in San
Jose.
The cas<> will be resumed at 10:30
to-day, wnen the depositions will*be
taken.
ACCUSES HER BROTHER
OF EMBEZZLING MONEY
Mrs. Mary A. Fuller Obtains Warrant
for Arrest of Joseph T. Nodder,
Who Has Fled.
Mrs. Mary A. Fuller, 437 O'Farrell
street, obtained a warrant from Po
lice Judge Fritz yesterday afternoon
for the arrest of her brother, Joseph
T. Nodder, on a charge of felony em
bezzlement. The amount alleged m
the complaint is $900. Nodder has
left the city and is supposed to be in
Red Bluff.
Mrs. Fuller says that while she was
sick her brother advised her to change
her physician and on February 17 she
sent him to the Hibernia Bank, where
Bhe had $900 on deposit, to draw out
the money so that she might pay off
the phys*ii .an w ho had been attending
Iter. He drew the money from the
bank and when he returned he told
her that a suspicious-looking man had
been following him and suggested that
she should again deposit the money,
as it might be stolen.
She consented and Nodder took the
money lo the bank, but deposited it
iv his own name. Two days later he
drew the money out of the bank and
disappeared. She says she has re
ceived information that he Is in Red
Bluff.
HUSBAND CHASTISED WIFE
WITH UMBRELLA AND CLOCK
Divorce Granted to Mrs. Hewitt. Who
Suffered Indignities Until Nose
Was Broken.
Judge Seawoll yesterday granted a
divorce to Margaret J. Hewitt from
Arthur Hewitt on the grounds of
cruelty. She said that he had as
saulted her with an umbrella, hot cup
of coffee and a clock. By right time
should have been called when the last
named weapon was flung at her, but
after that he broke her nose.
Edith E. Forbes asks the court to
annul her marriage with J. W. or W.
W. Forbes, which took place at San
Jose in April, 1900. He used the "J"
as an Initial at that time, but she has
since discovered that "W. W." is the
correct sign for his given* name and
that he has another wife living from
whom he has not been divorced.
Suit for divorce was filed by Lillle
Gomez Wentz from Richard C. Wentz.
who, she says, was earning $200 a
month when he deserted her; by Ray
Mendel against Jules Mendel, who
struck her on the mouth with a salt
cellar; by Ella A. Gage against Fred
Gage, for desertion, and by Agnes
Brantley against Richard F. Brantley,
desertion.

WHY BRENNAN
ASKS FOR MONEY
Says Father Grey Assigned
Interest During Litigation
Pending With Archbishop
RECORDS IN EVIDENCE j
Testimony Offered to Prove
That Old Priest's Sight
Was Good Is Ruled Out
That an attempt was made to send
Dr. James F. Brennan to San Quentin ,
upon evidence now subject to question,
and that the doctor has a valid claim ',
to the $37,000 he received from Father
P. J. Grejj, were the two points put be
fore Judge Sloss yesterday by Attor
ney William M. Cannon, representing
the defendant in the suit of the aged j
priest, who seeks to recover money al
leged to have been won from him by
fraud.
Cannon offered the records of the
litigation between Father Grey and the
Archbishop over the funds then on de
posit in the Hibernia Bank. He con
tends that while this litigation was
pending Father Grey, on September 13.
1899. assigned his interest in the litiga
tion to Brennan for services performed
and to be performed, after Grey's ec- i
clesiastical friends had deserted him.
The claim then was practically worth
less and dependent upon the decision '
of the court, and, says Cannon, If the
Archbishop had won, Brennan would j
have had nothing for his services. j
An attempt was made to offer the
evidence of Drs. Barkan and Pischel,
oculists, to controvert the contention of
the plaintiff that Father Grey was al- '
most blind when in Brennan's care. '
but the testimony was ruled out-on the
objection that a physician cannot di
vulge the condition his patient. Can
non proposed to prove that Dr. Barkan
treated Father Grey for a cataract in '
one eye while the sight of the other
was good, in 1900, and by Pischel that
the pries i eyes were practically nor- !
mal for a man of his years in 1903. I
Mrs. Wester, with whom Brennan
and Grey boarded from 1899 to 1902,
testified that the father was able to
read the papers and discuss their con
tents and that he was physically able
to walk ud and down and around the
house and garden.
Evidence given in the trials of the
criminal charges against Brennan were
offered in comparison with the cvi- j
dence and contentions in the present
case to pro.-c that Father Grey's mem- [
ory was not good and that the plead
ings upon which it was sought to t on- 1
vict Brennan of a felony had been j
abandoned in the civil suit.
STATE SUES TO ENJOIN
BUILDING AND LOAN CONCERN
Attorney Genera] Alleges That Pa- â¢
ciflc Const Savings Society Is
Violating the Law.
Upon the charge that the Pacific 1
Coast Havings Society has violated the
law governing fche operations of build
ing and loan associations Attorney
General U. S. Webb, on behalf of the
neople of the State, yesterday brought
oUit to enjoin the society from trans
acting further business until a hear
ing can be had on the report of
Charles M. Shortridge and D. W. !
Field, commissioners of building and i
loan associations. Besides the soci- I
ety, the defendants named in the ac
tion are its directors, C. S. Benedict,
Harry Francis, Barclay Henley, H. S. j
Davis and W. H. Smith.
The complaint sets forth that the |
comr-issioners v made an examination!
into tne affairs of the concern in May |
of last year and supplementary exam-
I nation on January 27, resulting in the I
discovery that the society had made j
loans on insufficient security and con
ducted Its business in an unsafe man- j
ncr, such as to render further pro- \
ceedings on its part hazardous to the :
public. By reason of its methods, it '
is charged, the corporation has be- j
come insolvent.
OFFER TO PUT ON DRESS
SHOCKS JUDICIAL DIGNITY
Judge Daniels Distrusts His Own Eyes
and Will Obtain Expert
Counsel.
The official dignity of Judge j
Daniels received a shock yesterday :
when Mrs. B. Bernstein of the Hotel
Majestic offered to array herself in a ,
dress made by Tailor S. Honig to give !
the Judge an opportunity to see what j
a ridiculous fit the garment was.
The suggestion of the court that j
competent experts be brought in to j
give testimony was rejected with scorn !
by both sides, Mrs. Bernstein averring 1
that the dress never did fit and Honig
alleging that he wasted nine fittings
in trying to make the garment con
form to Mrs. Bernstein's wishes.
Honiy says that when Mrs. Bern- j
stein received the dress she was de- I
lighted, but that the subsequent en- '
vious criticism of acquaintances
caused her to change her mind and
refuse the payment of $40. Both par- l
ties agreed finally to leave the matter !
to the court without prejudice. De
cision was reserved to give the Judge
time to consult the authorities on j
dress architecture.

GRANEY TO GET
PART OF WORK
Bidder Will Not Be Ruled
Out From the Distribution
of Horseshoeing Contracts
EXTEND SWINE LIMITS
Supervisors Discuss Nui- 1
sance Caused by Smoke of
the Garbage Crematory
" i
The joint Supervisors' Police, Elec
tricity and Health Committee wres
tled again yesterday with the proposed
award of contracts for the shoeing of
horses of certain city departments, it
had been suggested by the Finance
Committee that the contracts be
awarded to Ed Toy, who bid $2 25 per
horse, and five members of the Mas
ter Horseshoers* Association at $2 50
per horse. Eddie Graney, however,
was to be excluded in the award
though he bid $2 50 and proved his
responsibility. Graney himself vigor
ously objected to being shut out and
wanted to know the reason why.
"I've got a right to know why my
bid is ignored, - ' said Graney. "If it
is a petty political proposition I want
to know it."
D'Ancona said it had been suggest
ed to exclude Graney because it was
thought he had done enough of the
city's horseshoeing and he should give
some one else a chance.
Boxton's motion that the award of
contract for horseshoeing be post
poned until July 1, when new bids
will be invited, was lost, as was also
Finn's motion that the contract be
awarded to Ed Toy, the lowest bidder.
McClellan's motion that Toy's bid be
rejected was not seconded. The mo
tion to include Graney in the award
was lost when it was first put, but
was carried the second time and the ,
resolution on the subject will be pre
sented at next Monday's meeting. i
The board passed to print an
amended ordinance so as to include
St. Mary's College tract in the limits
within which the keeping of more
than two rows is prohibited to go into
effect on March 1 next. Another or
dinance was passed to print prohibit
ing the keeping of swine in the city
limits with the exception of Butcher
town and the Union Stockyards, the
ordinance to become effective on July
1 next.
Comte called attention to the nui
sance caused by the fumes from the
chimney of the Sanitary Reduction j
Works, which he characterized as in- .
tolerable. Payot produced a letter j
from the corporation, in which it is :
said that steps are being taken to !
control the fumes. Payot agreed that
the smoke was a nuisance, but could
only be abated by exacting the sepa
ration of the garbage and other ref
use in the burning. D'Ancona said
that the company wa: c-iing all in its |
power to remedy the evil.
The board allowed $500 for the con- :
tinuation of sanitary work in China
town. Deputy Health Officer Levy
explained that the work would be ,
completed by March 1 next.
The petition for the placing of an
electric light at Twenty-third and Dia
mond streets was referred to the Light
Committee, which meets next Thurs
day at noon.

little over two years ago she was play
ing in Paris and was heard by Melba,

remarkable performances, engaged her
for American and Australian tours. In
spite of her youth Signorina Sassoli
achieved astonishing success through
out both tours. Mme. Melba take 3
great pride In the achievements of her
young protege.
The programme for both concerts in
San Francisco will be noted for their
brilliancy, and the interest in them may
best be judged by the hundreds of In

EXPERT J. J. DWYER
STILL ON THE RACK
California Probate Lawyer Is Sub
jected to Sharp Questioning by
Mrs. Hopper's Attorney.
J. J. Dwyer, the expert on California
probate law, who is testifying in the
Dunsmuir will hearing at Consul Ben
nett's office.- spent an unpleasant day
on the stand â¢ yesterday under the
sharp questioning of E. V. Bodwell of
counsel for Edna Wallace Hopper.
Mrs. Hopper and the intervenor,
Mrs. Joan Dunsmuir, are attempting
jointly to break the deceased capi
talist's will on the ground that it
should have been probated here in
stead of in British Columbia. They
allege that Alexander Dunsmuir was
a resident of this State. Dwyer has
been called upon to give his testi
mony and his answers have hitherto
slightly favored the proponents.
Mr. Dwyer was closely pressed by
the attorney and several times Charles
S. Wheeler for the proponents was
compelled to come to his assistance.
The cross-examination of Dwyer will
soon end and James A. S. Lowe, a wit
ness to trye will, will be put on the
stand to deny the statements accredit
ed to him subsequent to his recent ap
pearance as a witness. The contest
ants will endeavor to prove that Lowe
admitted to business men here that
he did not know the nature of the
will when he witnessed it.

CHIEF JUSTICE
MAY GIVE WRIT
Judge Beatty Favors Allow
ing Release of E. H. Hoar,
Jailed District Attorney
OUTCOME OF A SCANDAL
Officials of Merced County
Involved in Case Result
ing in Lawyer's Appeal
*
Echoes of the scandal that has stirred
Merced County for several weeks were
heard yesterday in the Supreme Court,
when Chief Justice Beatty listened to
arguments by counsel upon the ques
tion of allowing a writ of habeas cor
pus to E. H. Hoar, the District At
torney of Merced County, who was re
cently failed for contempt of court.
The alleged contempt of court con
sisted in the refusal of the District At
torney to answer a question put to him
by the counsel for several Supervisors
and employes placed under indictment
by him. Yesterday the Chief Justice
said he thought the question had been
sufficiently answered according to the
evidence submitted, but that he would
reserve his decision on the writ. In the
meantime he allowed District Attorney
Hoar his freedom on his own recog
nizance, there being no objection by
counsel.
Several weeks ago there existed po
litical friction in Merced County be
tween the Board of Supervisors and the
Sheriff's office and ill feeling was rife.
About this time the District Attorney
is said t.o have discovered collusion be
tween membjrs of the Board of Super
visors and employes who had been or
dered to inspect the building of the
County Hospital.
A venire ior a Grand Jury was is
sued by Judge E. N. Rector of the
Superior Court, and it is that
among these men were nine who were
objectionable to the District Attorney's
office. These nine men were subpenaed
by the District Attorney as witnesses
and at his request were excused by the
court frc-m serving. The Sheriff was
then ordered to secure a special venire
and nine other men were made grand
jurors. Following this, indictments
were found by the Grand Jury against
Supervisors Thomas Price and A. B.
Hamilton, W. H. McElroy and Archi
tect McDougall and F. H. Robinson,
employed by tin 5 Board of Supervisors
to inspect the building.
Frank H. Farrar and Smith & Os
trander, attorneys for the defendants,
attacked 'he Grand Jury, and during
the trial District Attorney Hoar was
asked whether he had in mind the
using of the Grand Jury against the
Hoard of Supervisors and the District
Attorney refused to answer. Judge
Rector held him guilty of contempt and
imprisoned him.
In his opinion. Chief Justice Beatty
held, that the court was in error in
dismissing the first nine grand jurors,
as their being subpenaed as witnesses
would only affect the cases in which
they were to give testimony. . He also
sustained tlie cortte*rftlo>i of Judge LaW,
who appeared on behalf of the District
Attorney, that this proceeding might
be construed as a charge that the Dis
trict Attorney packed the jury, when
it was not the intention so to do. The
Chief Justice held that from the testi
mony submitted the District Attorney
had answered the question to the best
of his ability in .previous answers.
The test case under the fruit ship-;
ping law, which involved the arrest
of Char!-s E. Hayden of Watronville,
on the charge of failing to place the
name of the locality in which the fruit
was grown on each box before ship
ment, came up yesterday in the Su
preme Court. The attorneys asked a
postponement for the purpose of filing
briefs, and time was allowed them.
SUICIDE USES FIFTEEN
FEET OF CLOTHESLINE
'Climbs a Eucalyptus Tree on the Old
Ocean House Road and Then *
Hangs Himself.
As Michael Barry, a laborer at the
Spring Valley pumping station, was
going to his work yesterday morning
he saw hanging from a eucalyptus
tree on the old Ocean House road the
body of a man. The rope was a new
clothesline fifteen feet long and the
feet of the corpse were six feet from
the ground. The suicide had climbed
the tree, fastened one end of the rope
to a stout limb and tied the other end
around his neck, first tying a silk
handkerchief about his neck to pre
vent the rope from cutting into the
flesh.
On the person of the suicide when
searched by the Coroner's deputies
were found the following articles: A
gold filled watch of the Illinois Watch
Company, a gold plated watch chain,
a pocket book with the initials "C. A.
W.," a pair of mother of pearl cuff
buttons with the initial "W.," a pock
et knife, a five-cent nickel piece, a
gold badge of the Foresters of Amer
ica and a cigar case containing a well
colored meerschaum cigar holder with
amber mouthpiece. The body is fair
ly well dressed and is that of a man
about 35 years old. The hands are
those of a person not accustomed to
manual labor.
H. A. Zimmerman, a tailor, whose
place of business is at 419 y 2 Stockton
street, visited the Morgue last night
and identified the body as that of
Charles A. Westerland. a grocer's
clerk. He said Westerland was a na
tive of Sweden and had no relatives
in this city. Â« , *

MERITS OF PAVEMENTS
Committee Will Hear Argu
ments as to Superiority
of Asphalt or Bitumen
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
took action against the Yorke. Com
pany, whose contract for repairing
bituminous pavements was declared by
the City Attorney to be Illegal because
the board named had never authorized
the Board of Public Works to enter
into the contract. The board adopted a
resolution authorizing the Board of
Works to cause needed repairs to be
made to the bituminous rock paved
roadways of the accepted streets of the
city. The unexpended funds of the ap
propriation provided in the budget for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905, un
der the item of "repairs to bituminous
rock and asphalt pavements on accept
ed streets" are made available for the
purpose at the request of the Board of
Works, which had met in the morning
and requested that it be granted the
authority described.
The Board of Works has already re
ceived bids for the repair of Market
street from Second to Twelfth, the low
est being for $500 from the City Street
Improvement Company, and work will
be commenced at once. Other urgent
repairs will also be made under the
authorization.
At the meeting of the Finance Com
mittee D'Ancona desired to know the
reason for the delay In paving H and
Mission streets. Commissioner Aigel
tinger said there appeared to be some
difference of opinion between the Su
pervisors and the Board of Works, the
former having recommended the use of
asphalt, while the latter favored bitu
men. He said the property owners on
H street had signed a private contract
for bitumen, the United Railroads
would pave between its tracks with
bitumen and it would be unwise for the
city to ose asphalt on Its portion of the
street.
Aigeltinger explained that the asphalt
that was now being furnished for pav
ing was not of proper quality owing to
the fact that some of the injurious in
gredients were not extracted, which
lessened its wearing quality and caused
it to* crumble when dry. He said that
asphalt should be 98 per cent pure for
effective use.
J. W. McDonald asked to be heard
when the .merits of both pavements
I were taken up, as he was prepared to
j show the superiority of bitumen as a
i paving material. It was agreed to hear
j both sides at the meeting of the Street
| Committee to-morrow afternoon.
Aigeltinger assured the Finance Com
mittee that the street sweeping fund
should be conserved so that there
would remain $53,750 for the work in
April. May and June. The report of.
the Street Committee directing the
Board of Works to regulate the ex
penditures for street sweeping was
thereupon amended by the board so as
to eliminate the objectionable features
which caused the heated debate at the
last meeting.
The Board of Works was authorized
to pave with asphalt the roadway of
Mission street between Onondaga ave
nue and Porter avenue, at an estimated
cost of $80,000.
The Board of Works also recommend
ed tbe purchase of three sweeping ma
chines at a cost of $1005.
POLICEMAN MURPHY
DECLARED BLAMELESS
Coroner's Jury Finds That Youns
Thompson Came to His Death
as Result of Accident.
A Coroner's jury yesterday exoner
ated Policeman M. Murphy from
| blame for the death of John Thomp
son on January 20. The evidence was
that Thompson, who was 20 years old,
was with a crowd of from forty to
fifty boys in the vicinity of Wood
ward's Pavilion, where a bull light
was about to be held, and were creat 1
ing much disturbance by yelling and
jeering. When Thompson came along
'he was ordered back by Policeman
j Murphy, but. refused to obey the or
| der and attempted to go on. The lat
| ter pushed him back with his hand
and Thompson fell to the sidewalk,
his head struck upon the curb and
his skull was fractured. All the wit
nesses united in saying that Murphy
raised the youth up, took him to a
doorstep and did all he could to bring
I him to consciousness.
After the announcement of the ver-
I diet Murphy was restored to duty by
i Chief Wittman.
Principals Indorse Compromise.
The principals of the city schools
met yesterday afternoon at the City
Hall to Indorse the recommendation
of the special committee to Sacra
mento in favor of a compromise of
the legislation 1 affecting the disposal
of the State apportionment for the
support of the schools. The com
promise suggested by President Ron
covieri, Superintendent Langdon and
others that 10 per cent of the fund
be equally distributed and the remain
ing 90 per cent be apportioned accord
ing to school census received the
hearty support of the principals.

PUBLICATION OFFICE.7 THIRD A KD~MARKBT STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
TUESDAY JANUARY 81, 1905
T HE Portland Oregonian ?nd the Seattle papers editoria' y de
fend the American sealers against the attack made upon them in
the Senate by Senator DolHver of lowa. It is an inteiesting
matter because of its legal and international aspect. The statutes
of Congress passed to protect the seals on the Prybiloff Islands in
Bering Sea foibade pelagic sealing in "waters under the jurisdiction
of the United States." Long after that became *he law, Mr. Blame
conceived the doctrine that' Bering was a closed sea, and was all
under our jurisdiction westward, to a line drawn from the mainland
to the extremity of the Aleutian archipelago, and that west of that
line to the Siberian coast the sea was closed and under the exclusive
jurisdiction of Russia. Immediately npon this interpretation of our
State Department, we began seizing and confiscating all fishing and
hunting ships on our side and Russia did the same on hTS. Our
Government seized and interfered with a large number of American
ships that had been cleared from San Francisco, Astoria and Puget
Sound ports, and a large number o f British ships that were cleared
frcm Victoria. Russia con^seated American and British ships also.
Qreat Britain protested these seizures, and after long diplo
matic exchanges the United States made a treaty of arbitration with
her, under which an international arbitral court was arranged and
held sessions in Paiis to determine whether Bering was an open or
a closed sea. Russia joined with us in the contention that it was a
mare clausum. After a long and interesting hearing the arbitrators
decided that Bering is an open sea, and that the jurisdiction of
Russia and ihe United States extends only three miles from their re
spective shores. This made our Government liable to Great Britain
ii it her ships tbat we had seized, and made Russia liable to Great
Britain and to us for the seizures made by her. We then made a
protocol with Great Britain for the creation of a judicial arbitration
to determine the amount due Tor the British ships we h*d ? a 'u :d.
This arbitral court sat at Victoria, B. C., the seat of the British
sealing industry. The senior counsel of the United States before
that court was Hon. Don M. Dickins no.' Detroit. The British
claims riled amounted to nearly $2,000,000. Mr. Dickinson found
himself without any testimony as to the value of the seized prop
erty by which to contest the valuations put upon it in the British
testimony In this emergency the American sealtrs, whose property
had been despoiled by the 1 ' 1 * own Government, came to the rescue
and volunteered thei r exper* testimony on the value <ji the British
ships. They did this at personal risk, for the feeling in Victoria was
so bitter against them that they were the victims f many attacks and
assaults. But they bravely stcod their ground, and their testimony
scaled the British claims down to something less than $400,000, for
which the corn gav< judgment and the United States paid it.
Then the United States demanded pL/ of Russia for the Ameri
can ships she had seized, and that demand was arbitrated by Dr.
Asser in the Hague c.-urt, who gave us a large judgment, which Rus
sia paid. Great Britain th<m dexnanded indemnity from Russia for
the seizure of British ships, and this was paid by diplomatic arrange
ment, without resort + o an international court, as all the issues had
been already closed and liability decided at Victoria and the Hague.
This left all of the despoiled sealers compensated for their 'osses ex
cept the Americans, who had been despoiled by their own Govern
ment. Mr. Dickinso'% in his final official report to our Government
on the Victoria arbitration, stated the service rendered to their
country by the American sellers, .vhose testimony had so largely
reduced the British cL.ms, and asked for them justice and com
pensation from their own Government for its seizure of their'prop
erty. The obligation to compensate them was clearly legal. Their
Government had seized, destroyed and interfered with their property
while in waters where it had no juri diction, ar.d where they had a
legal right to be, under the law of the sea. These poor men, nearly '
all of them in pinching poverty through the confiscation of their
property, had also put their Government under a moral obligation
to indemnify them by coming .0 its assistance as witnesses at Vie- '
toria. thereby saving it a million dollar o or more.
Mr. Dickinson presented their case to Congress, refusing any
compensation, and acting solely on the moral obligation to them,
which appealed to his honor. The bill fcr their relief proposed that â¢
the Circuit Court of the United States in San Francisco take equity
jurisdiction, hear their cases and determine what, if any, relief is
due them, rendering judgment therefor, to be paid by a future ap
propriation by Congress. This bill, after close examination, was re
ported favorably by the Judiciary Committee of the House, and i
the Foreign Affairs Committee of ..he Senate, and has been fitfully
under discussion all of this month.
As the press of Portland and Puget Sound \\ls noted, the bill
has been bitterly opposed by Senator Dolliver, who, by vicious at
tacks on the sealers and on Mr. Dickinson, has mutilated it until it j
affords no relief at all to these poor men who came to the assistance
of their Government after it had despoiled them. The Senator's at
tack on Mr. Dickinson has been especially vicious and untruthful.
It is a distorted conception of a Senator's duty and privilege to libel
a private citizen in the Senate where he has no privilege of appear-1
ance and reply, and in so far as such an attack has influenced tlie
action of the Senate that body has erred and should be willing to j
correct its mistake. The position of Senator Dolliver puts this
Government in company of the Latin American states, which de
spoil their own citizens with impunity, while they are compelled by
international law to compensate the nationals of other countries for
similar spoliations.
A majority of these suffering men are in San Francisco; they
are California sailors; they went from here to the rescue of their
Government at Victoria, and Senator Dolliver proposes that the bill
shall send them to the Coutt of Claims in Washington, where their
poverty prevents them from going, and that that court shall be
denied the right to enter any judgment in their favor! It is fantas
tic cruelty and injustice that has no rival outside of Santo Domingo
and Haiti. â¢
ONE thing is to be said for the leading Mormons. They have
the courage of their convictions and stand by polygamy. Mr.
Kimball, son of the redoubtable and much-wived Heber C.
Kimball, and Secretary of the Seventy, last Sunday,' in the Logan
Temple said: "These good women in the East want Congress to
stop this practice of polygamy. I would like to see Congress try it.
They will have something on their hands if they do."
It is evident that this ugly issue will not down. The Mormon
leaders are determined to keep polygamy going, and as soon as pos
sible to renew its public practice as an institution of the church.
They feel secure of enough political influence to effect this, by pre
venting an amendment to the Federal constitution making it a Fed
eral question. Under these circumstances it is evident that Congress
cannot too soon "have something on their hands."
When Senator Smoot began presenting his testimony to the
Seriate Committee on Privileges and Elections, he featured the
evidence of a number of "Jack Mormons," and seemed to make out
a pretty good case to prove that the church manifesto against polyg
amy, which was promulgated to obtain statehood for Utah, was
being observed. But now it appears that professors in the State
University are living in polygamy, that it is taught in nearly 300
of the public schools of Utah, and Mr. Kimball defies Congress to
stop it. This is a defi to the nation. Stronger combinations than
the Mormons have defied the United States and have lived to regret
it. Defiance is safe in the Logan Temple, for the time being. But
temples that are the sanctuary of crime have been leveled before 1
now, and what has been may be again.
It seems clear that there will have to be more centralisation of authority
In Panama affairs If the canal is ever to be built without undue expense and
loss of time. Not many cooks are enough to spoil the broth of great engineer
ing works.âCleveland Leader. ,

A MORMON DEFI.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 31, 1905.
Queen's Choice
CAMPBELL MacLEOD
"I am young," the jester whim
pered.
THE jester bowed low before the
throne. The King extended a
much bejeweled hand. The jest
er bent over it reverentlyâand
slyly bit it. The Queen laughed
behind her fan and beckoned the
clown to her side. He sank on the
steps at her feet.
"This is my throne for to-night,"
he announced, gayly Jingling his bells.
"I shall surrender It to no one. For
one night I shall speak only the plain,
unvarnished truth, your Majesty."
"One who would speak the truth,
Sir Cap-and-Bells," replied the Queen
sagely, "must needs have some pre
vious experience."
"Ha! ha!" chuckled the King,
beaming at the vision at his side.
"Well said, my lady. Previous expe
rience, Sir Fool!"
Age jangled in the voice of the
King; youth bubbled in the laughter
of the jester. The Queen unconscious
ly leaned on the arm next to the
clown and closed her eyes for.a mo
ment to rest them from the bewil
dering sight before her. To be Queen
of one of the most splendid Mardi
Gras balls is something to turn a girl's
heart. But this one, to judge by her
weary eyesâin spite of the magnifi
cence surrounding her and in face of
the King's open devotionâwas bored.
And the evening was only beginning.
The jester at her feet played with
his bells and hummed "If Ever I
Cease to Love" in time with the mu
sicians far overhead. As he sang he
watched the face of the Queen. Sud
denly she turned to him.
"Sir Fool," she said gently, "that
air goes not with that get-up. Save
your voice for 'Tell Me, Pretty
Maiden.' "
"Would she listen if I told her,
think you?" he whispered eagerly.
"There has never been but one pret
ty maiden for me, your Majesty."
"A maid is but a maid," the Queen
returned slowly. "And a man but a
man. And love is butâ"
"Everything!" the jester interrupted
seriously. "Love is all."
The King called the second time, then
had to touch the arm of the Queen be
fore she heard him. Two strange
Princes stood waiting to be presented.
Behind them came a train of Cupids, Loh

engrlns and monks, each bearing a tray
of compliments. The Queen's eyes were
big and suddenly bright. The King sat
with his fat hand on.his heart and
listened to her bandying repartee with
each in turn. The jester's bells were si
lent. He was attentively studying the
Queen's pink nails on the hand resting
on the vase of magnificent roses near
the throne.
"You should have been a Queen," the
King announced ponderously as the last
, troubador moved off.
"You were born a Queen," the jester
whispered eagerly.
"This splendor shall always be
yours," the King continued In business
tones. "Everything shall be yours that
money can buy. But you were fitted
i for a real throne."
" 'Kind hearts are more than coro
! nets,' " the jester sang softly to the air
! of "Under the Bamboo Tree." "And the
j truest throne is a throbb ng heart, lady"
> The Queen frowned at him Impatiently
[ and turned to the King, who was pre
senting two foreign generals, ablaze
with decorations. No, she was not
dancing, she told them. â¢ The King
couldn't dance, and It flattered him that
she was so well content on the throne
j beside him. The Incident was full of
I significance. He had wealth, social po-
I sitionâeverything but herâand now it
I seemed that his patience was to be re
! warded at last. What woman could
i hold out In such a fight? The Queen
; sighed and brought him back to earth.
JHe turned eagerly to her. She was
â¢ looking far away. Her thoughts, even
Ito a casual observer, were far removed
j from this crowded ballroom.
"You sighed, your Majesty," he
begged humbly. "You share my throne.
; Let me share your trouble, whatever
it is."
, The Queen laughed merrily. The
Jester touched his bells.
"Margot!" he whispered eagerly,
"Margot!" .j
The Queen ignored the appeal. A
marry crowd of troubadors were ap- j
proachlng and she paid for their com- |
pliments with a fire of smiles and
pretty speeches.
"If you would marry me," resumed !
the old King suddenly when the crowd
departed with backward bows and
obeisances, and they were alone save
for the jester, whom he did not see,
"you shall be queen in a palace as
beautifal as even you could desire."
"Margot!" entreated the jester.
"Love is everything!" The Queen
frowned at him impatiently.
"Marry me." pleaded the old King
hoarsely. "You are not one who can
stand poverty. Your mansion shall be
a palace; your jewels shall rival a
queen's."
"Marry me," whispered the jester,
catching hold of the hand behind the
rose. "To-day I bought a house, Mar
got. True there are but four rooms j
In It, but no place could be half so
dear. You could transform it into a I
home, Margot. I have no jewels but I
those of my 'ove to give you, Margot,
but you know that is true â"
"You shall cruise in a yacht on sum
mer seas," continued the deaf old
King. "And all Paris and London
shall rave of your beauty and your
splendor."
"We could slip off together to the
park," whispered the jester, "to listen
to the band on Sund.iy evenings. Don't
you remember what you told me un
der those moss-draped tree! that
night ?" The Queen toyed with her
fan and sighed.' "I love you! I love
you! I love you," chanted the Jester
passionately.
"As my wife," resumed the King,
"you wiil always be the queen of j
scenes like this." The eyes of the I
Queen swept the house before her.

In gorgeous gowns and jewels; menâ>

me. Can you afford to sell yourself,
Margot, for gold? What are the King's
I millions to my love, Margot?"
Into the eyes of the Queen a great
light suddenly leaped, but she sighed
again when she looked at the King.
One by one the maskers were strag
gling up to say good night. Far over
head the musicians were playing again
"If Ever I Cease to Love," the carni
val air. The King bent wearily toward
her.
' Shall I come for my arfswer to-mor
row?" he asked patiently. Then with
fresh ardor, "You will not walk the
world's way weeping, when the coach
man bids you ride, your Majesty?" he
questioned pleadingly.
"My love," the jester's lips touched
her hand. "If you choose the palace
who will keep my home?" The Queen
suddenly caught the clown's fingers
with a thrilling grasp. Quick as
thought, he slipped a ring on the third
finger of her left hand.
The King and Queen had risen to
depart.
"I shall come for my answer at four
to-morrow," he reminded.
"Whyâwhy not take It to-night," the
Queen asked shyly. "I can never marry
you, your Majesty, because I am to
wed another."
"To wed another?" the King faltered
pitifully. "To^wedâanother?"
"This Is he, your the
Queen replied, turning to the jester.
"Think," the King pleaded. Thinkâ"
"The Queen has thought." the Jester
announced in manly tones. And he
knelt and kissed the cold hand of the
King.â(Copyright, I*os, by D. C. Mac-

CAUGHEY'S FINE PICTURE
Large colored lithographs presenting
a blrdseye view of the Lewis and
Clark Exposition are being sent out
from Portland. The picture of the fair
is very handsome and those that see it
cannot help admiring its artistic ex
cellence. It is the work of Rollln
Caughey, an artist who was formerly
connected with the art ataff of The
Call. Th' Oregon Dally Journal in a
recent issue editorially pays a fine
tribute to Mr. Caughey, who, it says,
"in the course of an active life has
done much work of such a quality as
would have won him a national repu
tation had his fo.tunes' taken him to
the eastern section of the country."
MARRIAGE NOT A FAILURE

This Kansas Judge is credited with
having made $28,000 out of the matri
monial line. He never had any scruples
for charging $5 a couple, including li
cense and ceremony. He always expe
dited business, so that couples coming

The Smart Set
Away with bridgeâif you would be
â¢.mart. Whist is now the proper caper
in Gotham, bridge being left to the
toiling bourgeoisie.
Tou aye your bridge? To be sure
you do. But can you risk your reputa
tion by clinging to that which the
smart leaders pronounce passe?
Whistâthat's the thing now.
And it seems to bave been the thing
for some time "back East;" but we
didn't know it out here by the Western
sea.
Now, however, that the proclama
tions of Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish, Mrs.
Gerry, Mrs. Astor and other arbiters
of "what's what" have penetrated Into
the remote West, surely we can offer
no further extenuation or palliation for
continuing to play bridge.

ager of the Union Pacific Company,
and A. J. Dutcher, private secretary to
Stubbs, formed a party that arrived
here yesterday morning and registered
at the St. Francis Hotel. The coming
of Director Stubbs was unexpected,
notwithstanding the fact that he was
known to be in the Northwest, whither
he journeyed several days ago with
Assistant Traffic Director Stohr, who
was recently appointed to fill the place
vacated by Ben Campbell. Stohr left
the party In Poftland and Director
Stubbs and his assistants continued on
to this city.
Director Stubbs* trip to the coast at
this particular time is for the purpose
of inspecting the various departments
under his control, and, incidentally, to
visit his daughter in this city. As
usual, his trip has been preceded by
several rumors, one of which was that
he would soon resign his position, a
report that was denied, by him last
evening, as was also another to the
effect that he would have charge of the
traffic departments of the San Pedro,
Los Angeles and Salt Lake road as'
soon as that new line is ready to do
business. According to Director Stubbs
the Salt Lake Toad will have its own
traffic chiefs, who will act independent
ly of the Harriman directors,
Schumacher and Monroe accompanied
their chief westward, for the purpose
of discussing, with him various mat
ters, among them the future relations
i etween their, respective lines and .the
Salt Lake road as regards freight and
passenger traffic. The party returns

j Litigation Concerning the
Oakland Postoffice Build
ing May Go to State "Court
â¢
United States District Judgs William
H. Hunt of Montana handed down a
decision yesterday in the United States
Circuit Court in the case of the" United
States, on the relation of John P. Max
well against Augustus E. Barrett,.
Barrett was the contractor who built
the postoffice at Oakland. Maxwell
sought to recover $1776 alleged to be
due for hardware bought by the con
tractor. The American Bonding and
Trust Company of Baltimore, which
was surety for $80,000 on Barrett's
bonds, raised a demurrer to the suit on
the ground that the United States was
not a party to the action and that
therefore the Circuit Court was without
jurisdiction. Judge Hunt yesterday
sustained the demurrer and gave his
reasons for throwing the case out of
court. The decision will be- read with
interest, as it affects a large, number
of similar cases in this State. The fol
lowing Is an extract:
Circuit courts have cognizance ot any con
troversy in which the United States is plaintiff,
in the case at bar the United States is not, in
the- proper sens*, or within the intent of Con
gress, plaintiff in the controversy presented,
ior it is without concern or Interest therein.
Maxwell himself recognized this tact when in
the title of the case he designated himself aa
the plaintiff, when he described himself in tha
body of the complaint as .plafhtiff, and when in
the verification he swore that he was plaintiff.
I think Congress Intended to confer a Jurisdic
tion over suits and actions in which are con
troversies affecting the United States as plaint
iff and in which the Government of the United
States is more than a mere figurehead. â¢ * â¢
I am aware that the learned Judge who de
livered the opinion In Bolted States vs. Church,
yard, 13"? Fed. Rep. b3, is of opinion tnat in
acUons of this kind C.rcuit courts have juris
diction, but I think he failed to give effect
to the principle that no case is within the
jurisdiction of Federal courts (inferior to the
Supreme Court) unless Congress has unmis
takably conferred it. Support for the con
clusion that this court Is without Jurisdiction
is founded In the able opinions of Judges Baker
and Evans, delivered In United States to use
of Lumber Company vs. Hbderlong, 102 Fed.,
Rep. 2, and United States to use of Stone
Company vs. Sheridan, 119 Fed., Rep 33(1.
The demurrer of the American Bonding and
Trust Company of Baltimore is sustained and
an order will be made dismissing the action
for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter.

proved a great attraction, as evidenced
by the tremendous crowd in attend
ance and Vas voted a success by the
appreciative audience.
Signo'rs Colli and La Puma, the
former singing a selection from "L'Af
ricaine" and the latter a prologue from
"I'Pagliacci," won loud applause and
both were compelled to respond to the
encores. As a concluding contribu

that'proved a wonderful test for their
magnificent voices within the deep

vintages of France. His Clothing Is
made by a fashionable tailor. Former
Sergeant Montrose smokes big black
cigars, while* he leans back In his ma
hogany swivel chair and puts his pat
ent leather shoes on a mahogany desk.
It is only temporary. It is his duty
to affix his sigriautre to $45,000,000
worth of bends, which a number of
clerks of the Mount Clair Trust Com
pany, which has a contract for signa
tures, sign as the other officers of the
Colorado Company. Forty-five thou
sand bonds of the par value of $1000
each "were to be signed. About 1500

TRAGIC DEATH
OF DIPLOMAT
Anthony M. Keiley, Who
Served as Head of Cairo
Court, Run Over in Paris
HONORED BY CLEVELAND
Was Selected as Minister to
Italy and Later as Minister
to Austria, but Did Not Act
PARIS, Jan. 80.âConsul General
Gowdy has be .-n Informed by the au
thorities that a Btranger recently run
over and killed pn the Place de la Con
corde had been identified as former
Chief Justice Keiley of the Interna
tional Court of Appeals of Cairo, Egypt,
who recently had been residing in Lon
don.
Anthony M. Keiley first came Into
national prominence through his nom
ination by President Cleveland in 1886
as Minister to Italy. His appointment
was canceled on account of the objec
tions of the Italian Government. He
was then accredited by President
Cleveland as Minister to Vienna, but
the Austrian Government also declared
Keiley to be persona non grata, the ob
jection being that he held political and
religious views that were offensive.
Bayard went so far as to nay that
the appointment would be allowed to
stand even though it resulted in a ces
sation of diplomatic relations between
the United States and Austria.
To relieve the administration of Pres
ident Cleveland of further embarrass
ment Keiley resigned and later was ap
pointed to the International Court at
Cairo. He resigned In 1892, owing, it

CAR SERVICE IN NEW YORK
IS STILL BADLY CRIPPLED
Effort to Thaw Out Frozen Conduits
' Results In Injury to Slot
and Ralls.
NEW YORK. Jan. 30.âService on
many street car lines operated by un
derground trolley, suspended because
of last week's great storm, has not yet
been resumed, although thousands of
men have been at work clearing the
tracks. The chief trouble has been
found in cleaning out the conduits.
One of the most Important lines still
blockaded is thut on Eighth avenue,
passing along the western border of
Centred Park. No cars are running
north of Fifty-ninth street and it is ex
pected the line will be out of service
for some days to come.
In an effort to thaw out the frozen
underground conduits, gangs of track
men poured great cans of coal oil into
the slot and set it on Are. The blaze
thawed out the conduits to perfection,
but at the same time warped the slots
so that in places it may be necessary
to replace the metal. To add to the
damage the pitch between the Belgian
blocks, being Inflammable, burned out
and made a heat so great as to warp
the rails that are welded together.
WOMEN EAT CANDLES
TO PRODUCE BEAUTY
Illinois Minister Says He Knows Con
gregation Whose Members
Resort to Practice,
CHICAGO, Jan. 80. â"I know of
women In a congregation down In
Kenwood who eat candles to produce
beauty," declared Dr. Camden M. Co
bern, pastor of St. Jameg Methodist
Church, who preached at the First
Methodist Church in Evanston, yester
day. "But neither the diet of candles
nor the mangling of 'beauty doctors'
Is effective. True beauty of woman is
not brought out by these methods; it
must come from a life of beauty and
Christian service."

Region in the Philippines
*
MANILA, Jan. 81.âDetails receive*
concerning the operations ot Montalon
and Felizardo, the outlaw ladrons
leaders, show that frightful atrocities
have been committed. Natives who
have expressed or shown sympathy tor
Americans have been hamstrung and
their lips cut off. Justices of the Peace
have been abducted and killed.
Among the papers captured at Mon
talon's camp was a document offering
a reward for the head of Governor
Trias and also placihg prices on the
heads of other supporters of the Gov
ernment.
The two bandits are now operating
separately and troops are on the trail
of the bands. Persona faaniliar with
the situation declare that drastic meas
ures are the Government's only re
course.
The indications are that the disaf
fected element is confined to two pro
vinces. General Allan has reported
that the situation in the Island of Sa
mar has greatly Improved.
The ladrones, who captured the wife
and two children of former Governor
Trias In the attack on San Francisco
de Malabon on the night of January
24, now demand a ransom of 20,000
pesos for their release.
Habeas corpus has been suspended
in the provinces of Cavlte and Batan
gas. Major General Corbin is hearti
ly co-operating with Governor Wright
and Is giving him every possible aid
in suppressing lawlessness. Federal
troops consisting of detachments of
picked sharpshooters work In con
junction vith the native scouts and
the constabulary. Federal troops gar
rison the towns and martial law has
practically been established.
The present situation in the two
provinces is partially due to ladron
ism and to disaffection fostered by
the opponents of the Internal revenue
law.
The force of the bandit ladrones is
estimated at 500. The bandits have
intimidated peacefully inclined na
tives, w have been force to assist
them.

MISTY'S PRIDE WITH JAKIE JONES IN THE SADDLE
IS GIVEN A STIFF ARGUMENT BY TRAMOTOR
Three Public Choices Finish in Front at Oaftfand Course
Track Suits Barrack
and He Gallops
In First.
BY FRED E. MUI HOLLAND. j
Tramotor, a three-year-old from the |
Blute stable, had the backers of Misty's j
Pride, favoritevfor the laat event on the
card at Oakland yesterday, standing on
tiptoes for the fractional part of a sec - j
ond. The track was exceedingly slow j
and heavy and nine out of ten specta
tors seemed, to have a hunch that the,
Oregon mare would meet defeat. She
escaped, but It was a very close call. |
Jakie Jones rode the first choice and
Bad his mount out in front soon after j
the start. In the stretch McÃride on I
Tramotor moved up from third place, I
challenging the leader. The daughter
of Handsome and Misty Morn showed j
she was made of the right naterlal by i
standing off the clever three-year-old,
and in a long hard drive earned the
verdict by a short neck. Sea Voyage
ran third.
Public choices held their own, cap
turing three purses. Barrack, Best
Man and The Hawaiian all reached the
wire first at remunerative odds. The
usual crowd of regulars attended the |
racing.
Seme very vigorous saddle work on
the part of Bonner contributed largely
to the win of the opening event by The
Hawaiian. The books laid 5 to 1 about â 
the McCafferty entry, which in a driv
ing finish earned a neck decision over
Trapsetter, the pacemaker throughout,
Sam Greenfield finished third on Pen
cil Me, a 12 to 1 shot. Lloyd Fountain
rode a weak race on Doublet, the fa
vorite.
M. J. Daly's colt Golden Idol, at odds
of 11 to 10, took the three-year-old spil
ing sprint from an ordinary lot. My
Order and Lily Golding cut out the
early pace. The former quit In the
stretch, but the filly stood a hard drive,
even though beaten nearly half a dozen
lengths. My Order lost the show to San
Jose.
A barrel of coin was burned up over
the poor showing made by Sir Preston,
even money favorite for the five-fur
long dash. The paddock contingent
a went with the talent, and the sprinter
ran unplaced. Finishing strong on the
outside through the stretch, Best Man,
the third choice, ridden by Travers,
won easily from Pure Dale, a 20 to 1
shot. Slow to leave the barrier, Edu
cate nosed Sir Preston out of show hon
ors.
Tony Barrett's old campaigner Bar
rack made a show of his company In
the mile and fifty yard selling fixture.
Held a 6 to 1 chance throughout the
betting, the going was made to order
for the brown horse, and he finished
five lengths In advance of Cincinnatus
at the wire. The latter closed equal
favorite with Barney Drey fuss, Modi
cum finished fourth, a nose behind In
strument.
Dora I, a 6 to 5 favorite, piloted by
McÃride, led from start to finish in the
seven-furlong run. also decided under
selling conditions. Tommy Clark
brought Foxy Grandpa up from sixth
position, downing Box Elder a head for
the place. Follow Me faded away in
the stretch.
TRACK NOTES.
Walter Jennings will give Dainty
and Rockaway their preparation for
the Burns handicap at Inglesirl tack.
Jimmy McLaughlin has wired from
Los Angeles for two stalls at Oakland.
The noted ex-jockey is going to try
and win the big handicap on Saturday
with Pasadena. **"
L. A. Bonsack, who started Judge
Denton in the last race, has sent to
L(fs Augeies for High Chancellor and
two others of his stable. High Chan
cellor is entered in the Burns handi
cap.
Handicapper Horace Egbert was
confined to his home by illness yes
terday. In his absence Sam McGib
ben saw to it that the riders made
their correct weight.
Charley McCafferty will lu<ve quite
a stable if the selling- races hold out.
He boosted Golden Idol from $500 to
$1100 ant' Mike Daly let the colt go.
The stable connections bet on Judge
Denton. The Judge, however, bears
the reputation of being an uncertain
gambling proposition.
The field in the Burns handicap to be
run on Saturday will probably be made
up from the following list of entries:

BAN JOHNSON FRAMES UP
SCHEDULE FOR THE SEASON
Says American Ixaiguc Will Not Ac

Organizations.
NEW YORK. Jan. 30.âAfter a long
conference here with H. C. Pulliam,
president of the National League, Ban
Johnson, aresident of the American

everything will be satisfactory. There
will be only five conflicting dates In

The New York Americans will open
the season on April 14 at Washing
ton and will come back here to open
American League Park on April 21.
The season will close October 8. This
will leave only seven days for the
playing of the world's series.
"As far as the demands of the
minor leagues are concerned, the
American League will never accept
the proposition they have submitted."
The schedule meeting of the Ameri
can League W iU be held in this city
February 20 and that of the National
League either on that date or Febru
ary 15.

FAST BOUT IS EXPECTED
WHEN TINY MEN HOOK UP
Neil's Friends Think He Can Subdue Hyland
in Jig' Time Because of His Experience.
When Frankle Nell and Dick Hy
land match their skill and aggressive
ness to-night at Woodward's Pavilion
the question of whether a tough,
untried amateur boxer can wrest the
laurels from a hard puncher who has
met and defeated the best men of his
weight In the world will be settled.
Neil's reputation is at stake, while
Hyland's fate weighs In the balance.
Neil rules a 10 to 8 favorite over Hy
land.
It will be a fight of Californlan
against Californian. Both boys started
out in practically the same way. Neil's
rise was meteoric, for when he once
struck his gait he sustained a wonder
ful pace and won the praise of box
ing fanciers from ocean to ocean. Hy
land has managed to plug along, slow
but sure, and has the novel experi
ence of being pitted against a world
beater in his maiden professional at-
tempt.
Many theories are advanced by the
knowing followers of the game. Those
who fancy Neil's chances say he will
wade into his green opponent and
win the battle inside of ten rounds.
Hyland's backers are willing to con
cede that Neil will make a plaything
out of the amateur for a few rounds,
but then they look for Nell to blow
up and for Hyland to land one of Ais
telling punches.
No matter who wins, the fight will
surely be one replete with incidents.
Neil has always adopted the rushing
style of going and invariably starts at
his man when the bell brings them to
the center of the ring. Hyland's best
chance lies in his ability to weather
the storm of a few grueling rounds
and show his ability to carry the fight
to his opponent.
"Fighting Dick" has rarely met a
man of his own weight. He won many
a victory over a lightweight and has
met and defeated featherweights ga
lore. He is slow to start and clumsy
to gaze upon, but possesses the stam
ina and has invariably displayed game
ness in his numerous four-round en
counters in the amateur arena.
Both boys are trained to the hour
and neither can reasonably complain
of lack of condition when the mill is
over. The weight has been practically
an easy matter for each lad. Both are
of rugged build and young in years
and consequently the rigors of hard
training have not dragged or fagged
them.
Neil did a little light work at his
training quarters in San Rafael yes
terday and took a train for this city
early in the evening. He will take a
run this morning, visit the rac *Â»*ack
in the afternoon and expects to step
on the scales at the ringsidf well un
der the 122 pounds stipulated weight.
In his corner he will have Young Cor
bett. Frank McDonald and Tim Mc-
Grath.
Hyland rested practically all day
yesterday. He will take some light
exercise this morning and then rest
till the hour of battle. Ho expects to
break camp at 1Â« o'clock and spend the
afternoon with his family. In his cor
ner he will be waited on by Jack Mc-
Cormack. EUly McDonald. Mark
Shaughnessy and Jim McDermot.
The sale of seats has been exceeding
ly large and as the prices are all on
the popular order a big crowd Is ex
rected. The winner of the bout will
probably be matched with Jim Bowker
for the bantam-weight championship
of the world.
The betting opened at 2 to 1 In Neil's
favor yesterday morning, but *â¢ a few
hours the price rose to 10 tc 5, and
these odds prevailed throughout ,the
night. The change came as a surprise,
for the sports looked for 10 to 4 as the
odds. It Is likely that the men will
enter the ring with Neil selling at 10
to 7. for Hyland's backers are coming
to the front rapidly.
NELSON STILL AFTER BRITT.
Battling Nelson is still on the trail
of Jimmy Brltt. Billy Nolan, man
ager of the Great Dane, yesterday
made another futile attempt to in
duce the native son to sign for a bout
with the battler. Britt will not talk
fight for the present, so it now looks
as though Nelson will hook up with
Corbett next month.
It was expected that the pair might
be signed last night, but Nolan will
not come to terms with the Denverite
till he tries Brltt a few times more.
Then there Is a little trouble about
the division of the purse and Nolan
and Morris Levy, manager of the San
Francisco Club, will have to settle
that between them.
Nolan says he will pit the Dane
against Britt on any terms the latter
may desire. The weight does not fig
ure, says Nolan, neither does the di
vision of the purse. The only stipu
lation he makes Is thst Billy Roche
be barred aa referee. Nolan says Nel
son Is also open to boy Gana at 138
pounds at $ o'clock.

TAKES A LEAD
Sigourney Captures First
Game in Billiard Tourna
ment From New Yorker
CHICAGO. Jan. 30.â W. H. Sigourney
of San Francisco won the first game,
class A, amateur billiard tournament
begun at the Chicago Athletic Club to
night. His opponent was Charles S.
Norris of New York.
When the Pacific Coast representa
tive reached the COO mark his oppo
nent's score was but 212. Sigourney's
average was S 4-37, while that of Norris
was 5 22-36. Although defeated, Norris
made the high run duiirfg the contest.
When Sigourney fell down on an easy
shot, having only one point to go to win
the game, Norris, who had been play
ing In hard luck all the evening, made a
run of 46. He was too far behind his
opponent, however, for the run to do
him any good, and Sigourney ran out
the necessary 300 on the next time up.
Sigourney started off In the lead with
a run of fourteen. Norris' first inning
netted him four points. Sigourney con
tinued to lead up to the sixth Inning,
when Norris, with a run of twenty
nine, gained a lead of two points. In
the next Inning, however, Sigourney
again forged ahead with a run of four
teen and remained In the lead until the
finish.
Sigourney played a consistent game
all through the contest, while Norris.
who appeared to be in bad form, waa
rather erratic, missing many easy
â¢hots. He had twelve goose eggs scored
against him in the thirty-six Innings
played. Sigourney made seven goose
eggs, and this cut hie average down
during the latter part of the contest.
On account of the sickness of hia
father in San Francisco, H. A. Wright
tbe other Pacific Coast representative,
withdrew from the tournament to-day
and left for his home to-night. Thii
leave* but nine men to contest for th<
Brooklyn Eagle cup and the varioui
other prltes offered by the Chicagc
Athletic Association.

I was afflicted with Tetter in bad shape.
It would appear ia blotches as large as my
hand, a yellowish color, and scale off.
You can imagine how offensive it was.
For twelve years I was afflicted with this
trouble. At eight it was a case of scratch

am practically a well man. Only two
tiny spots are left on the elbow and shin,
where once the whole body waa affected,
t have every confidence In the medicine,
and feel sure that in a short time these
two remaining spots will disappear.

The Swift Swecifiu Uempauy, Atlanta, G*>BATTLESHIP OHIO ANNOUNCES APPROACH TO PORT
BY WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY WHILE SIXTY MILES OUT
Monitor Warning From Bremerton Is Here for Ammunition
Steamship Curacao
Brings Treasure
From Mexico.
The United States battleship Ohio,
Captain Logan, returned yesterday
from a cruise in Magdalena Bay. The
monitor Wyoming, bound from Brem
erton, met her big sister outside the
heads and In company the two fighting
machines; came In through the Golden
Gate. The Wyoming is bound for San
Diego and put in here for ammunition
aud stores.
Long before the Merchants' Ex
change observer at Point Lobos sighted
the Ohio the warship was in wireless
communication with Mare Island, Yer
ba Buena, Point Reyes and with Den
nis O'Brien. Captain Logan did not
know he was talking to Dennis O'Brien
and as far as O'Brien was concerned
the conversation was all on the other
side.
O'Brien is Interested in numerous
inventions and among the scientific ap
paratus of which his laboratory at 106
Union Square is a maze is a wireless
telegraphy outfit. The instrument was
tuned to catch any aerial talk that
might happen to be floating about and
at 4 o'clock yesterday morning O'Brien
was awakened by the ringing of an
electric bell, which to-ld that his word
trap had caught a conversation. He
went to the instrument and found that
talk waves from one of Uncle Sam's
finest battleships had washed against
the receiver and touched off the alarm
which had disturbed his slumbers.
The Ohio asked for Goat Island and
when Goat Island answered, the opera
tor at the naval training station was
informed that the Ohio was sixty miles
away, homeward bound. Captain Lo
gan asked to be reported to Mare Isl
and and notified the commandant of
the navy yard that the Ohio would
proceed to her anchorage off the Union
Irem Works.
The Ohio asked and obtained the cor
rect time. Then the battleship was
supplied with the latest news from
Russia and Japan and furnished with
a few items of social interest in naval
< ircles. In return the Ohio told Goat
Island how the big battleship's engines
had worked during the trip.
The officers of the battleship sent
messages to fair friends in San Fran
< isco, and when both sides were talked
out the letter V was sent every five
minutes for the purpose of testing the
working of the apparatus. The Ohio
began calling Goat Island and ringing
Dennis O'Brien's bell at 4 a. m. She
entered the harbor at 9 o'clock.
The Ohio has been away for about
two weeks. Captain Logan overlooked
the quarantine boat, but when Pilot
Jordan called his attention to the ap
proaching General Sternberg the Ohio
returned to the quarantine limits and
hoisted the yellow flag as evidence of
submission to the Federal health reg
ulations. Everybody on the battleship
was glowing with health and the Ohio's
detention was brief.
At Magdalena Bay the Ohio's big
guns had a chance to speak right out
in war time style, and although the
oificial report of the firing test will
not be made public until it has reached
the Navy Department the Ohio's offi
cers appear to be satisfied that the bat
tleship's heavy battery will be able
to give a good account of itself when
called upon.
The Wyoming, Captain Roller, had a
stormy passage from Puget Sound. The
toast defense ship lies low in the water
anyhow, and the waves through which
she made her southern way were un
usually high. With only her super
structure above water for most of the
time, the Wyoming came through the
ordeal In good tihape. No damage was
done to the vessel, no member ,of the
crew was injured and the run from
Premerton to San Francisco was made
:n three and a half days.
Nearly Runs Down Launch.
The careless manner In which the Southern
Pacific freight ferry steamers Transit and
Thoroughfare are handled has become a by
word on the bay. When there Is any pos
sibility of collision these two big boats come
together and they are both dreaded by the
pilots of all the passenger ferries. The
Thoroughfare, Captain Erdman in command,
yesterday narrowly ,-scaped running down the
Crowley launch Guide, which was loaded with
passengers. The Thoroughfare was bound from
Central Basin to Oakland and the launch from
Mission Bay to Vallejo street. The launch
had the ferry-boat on her port bow and had
the right of way. In accordance with the
rules of the road the launch sounded one
whistle, which the Thoroughfare ignored.
Three times did the launch signal without re
sponse from the Thoroughfare. Then the
launch blew four whistles, saying In signal
language, 'T do not understand." Still silence
from the Thoroughfare, whioh by this time
was close to the launch. Then, when it was
too late for the launch to change its course
the Thoroughfare blew two whistles, meaning,
"I am going to violate the rules of the road
and pass you to the left. Get around under
my stern." Had the launch stopped or tried
to pass under the Thoroughfare's stern noth
ing could have saved the Guide and her ayis
sengers. The engineer hooked on his gasrWlne
engine and crossed the Thoroughfare's bow,
getting past by a very narrow margin. P.
Figari, who was in charge of the Guide, Is a
licensed engineer and a complaint against
Captain Erdman will be lodged with the United
State* inspectors.
Is Eighty Years Old.
George Johnson, who is engaged In the min
ing department of the Risdon Iron Works

times a week and is younger In energy than
many men of half his years. He devotes all
his attention to the Intricate mining ma
chinery with which he is so familiar and with
the present high development of which his
Inventions have had much to do. He was
born In Ireland, January 31. 1814. He came
to America when he was fourteen and crossed
the plains to California in 1850. From 1855
to 1861 he was Under Sheriff of Placer County

ELECTRIC LINE
NOW ASSURED
Board Grants a Permit for
Reconstruction of Califor
nia - Street Steam Road
CONDITION IS IMPOSED
United Eailroads Will Put
Up Iron Poles Part of Way,
but Balks at Flat Rails
The Board of Supervisors yesterday j
passed to print a resolution granting
permission to the United Railroads to
operate by electricity that portion of
the California street extension system
from Parker avenue to First avenue.
This action will enable the corporation
to convert the entire steam road into
an electric line, as its franchise for the
rest of the road already gives it the
necessary authority. The resolution
was Introduced by the Street Commit
tee, which imposed a condition that in
the reconstruction iron poles shall be
used instead of wooden poles along
California street from Parker avenue
to Eighth avenue.
Attorney Tirey Ik Ford said the cor
poration desired to convert the steam
road to an electric line, which would
Involve a great expense, but the addi
tional cost of ire n poles did not war
rant their erection owing to the fact
that much of the territory to be
"tapped" is sparsely settled and the
streets are unpaved. He said:
"The franchise for the larger portion
of the road will expire in six years.
We want to give "ou a fine electric sys
tem, that will result in the district be
ing settled. While we think the Street
Committee has imposed a burden by
requiring us to buy iron poles, we ac
cept the burden cheerfully. We have
spent more than $3,000,000 in permanent
improvements already, and will spend
more."
Ford argued that the grooved rail
should not be insisted upon.
O. L. Scott said the property owners
had signed to bltuminize California
street from First to Eighth avenues,
and that the grooved rails should be
used on those blocks. Scott said that
Some people had expressed surprise at
his intention to appear before the board
in opposition to the United Railroads,
whieli might hurt him in his business j
for doing so.
Ford resented this Imputation, saying
that the assertion was not worthy of j
notice. Ford said the company would
keep pace with the Improvements made
by property owners.
A representative of the Point Lobos
Improvement Club urged that the per
mit for the system be granted. Prop- i
erty owners filed petitions both for and
against the granting of the privilege.
Chairman Connor of the Street Com
mittee explained that the company had i
agreed to replace the-wooden poles from
First to Eighth avenues with iron poles.
The committee, however, did not deem
It advisable to compel the laying of
grooved rails at this time.
Lunstedt asked whether the company
would agree to put down the flat rails
from Parker avaiujes tn view
of Its proposed bituminizlng, and Ford
replied in the negative. Connor objected
to imposing any new condition which
might cause the corporation to abandon
the project.
When the resolution had been passed
to print Ford extended an Invitation to
the Supervisors to acquaint themselves
with the conditions as they exist and
to make suggestions for improvements.
Boxton wanted to know whether any- !
thing could be done to relieve the con
gested traffic on the Market street cars
In the evening. Ford assured the board
that arrangements were being made
whereby no delay would be experienced
in moving the cars at the ferry depot,
and that everybody would then be able
to ride Inside the cars.

COURT AUCTION
BOOSTS VALUES
Inventory Price of Block in
Sunset Nearly Doubled
When Bidders Get Active
PROFIT FOR AN ESTATE
Judge Coffey Not Satisfied
With Former Sale and the
Results Justify His Views
A* judicial knowledge of realty values
in .this growing city has served to
shame the expert opinion of a trio of
appraisers appointed by the court to
fix* the value of a block of sand oh
the fringe of present habitations, and
a boom may be looked for in lots with
an ocean view. â 
In their first appraisement of the es
tate of the late Herman J. Sadler of
the firm of Ma.v, Sadler & Co., the
appraisers, F. P. McCann, F. P. Thall
and J. T. O'Connor, reported the block
in the Sunset District bounded by N
and O streets and Sixteenth and Sev
enteenth avenues as worth $4500, sub-Â«
ject to a $20,000 mortgage. It developed
that the mortgage blanketed other
property and a reappraisement was
made In which the block in question
was returned at $9000. Then an order
of sale was made and the highest bid
for the block was from William F.
Mau & Co., successor to the c?ld firm,
and the property was knocked down
for $Â»200, subject to the approval of
the court. Judge Coffey, however, was
not satisfied with this price for so
much ground, with its added privilege
of Pacific sunsets. He ordered an auc
tion In court. Then came the revela
tion. There were real estate sharps
who wanted the property for specula
tion and were willing to gamble on the
spread of population over the upper
peninsula. They began raising the $9200
bid by the clip at $500 and before the
competitors tired of the game an offer
of $17,000 was made, at which price
the court sold the block to Mabry Mc-
Mahon.

BOOK CONCERN
MEN ARE ANGRY
Methodists Meet and Make
Protest Against Sale of
Market Street Property
MAY SEEK LAW'S AID
Nathaniel T. Coulson Says
That He Has Offered an
Advance on Price Named
â¦
Much indignation waa expressed yes
terday by members of the commission
for the care of the San Francisco de
pository of the Methodist Book Con
cern that a contract for the sale of ths
building 1037 Market street should
have been effected without their knowl
edge and consent of Eaton & Mains,
the Eastern agents.
A meeting was held at Epworth Hall,
in the very building which may slip
from the hands of the Methodists, and
protests were freely made and even
court proceedings considered. Tele
grams containing resolutions were sent
to Methodist headquarters in New York
City and Cincinnati, Ohio, expressing
the views of those who are most con
cerned in the interests of California
Methodism.
The Rev. Mr. Keast was in the chair,
and among those who took part in the
proceedings was Bishop Hamilton.
If there had been any doubt about
the actual disposal of tne valued prop
erty it was dispelled when the follow
ing explanation was suDmitted by J. A.
Jones:
SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 28, 1905.
In relation to the sale of the realty of tha
Methodist Book Concern, 1037 Market street, I
have to say:
lam a real estate broker. Have operated In
euch capacity In and aoout San Francisco
during- the last fifteen years. For several
yearsâat' least eight or tenâl have tried at
different times to secure authorization for the
sale of the said property.
In April last I wrote to the authorities in
New "York City that I had a client to whom
sale might be made. I received no reply unUl
about Christmas time, when I was fully au
thorized to sell the property. I did so sell the
property during last week to Mr. Louis Fried
man of this city.
Of course, 1 had authority to sell the real
estate only. I understand that the depository
business of the Methodist Book Concern ls to
be continued as heretofore at tne oiu stand, or
in new quarters. JOHN A. JONES.
So worked up were a number oi those
who have for years taken an interest
in the establishment and the welfare
of this Western branch of the Book
Concern that they readily agreed to
transmit the following by telegraph to
the Western Book Concern, Cincinnati:
Resolved. That this meeting respectfully in
form the Western agents that our people on
the coa3t are greatly agitated by the reported
sale o: the property at 1037 Market street to
an outside party; and we earnestly hope for an
early assurance that not less than $125,000
shall be expended in providing adequate and
eligible quarters for the Christian Advocate
and Depository in the city of San Francisco;
and It Is our Judgment that the sale of the
property should not be consummated until
good or better property shall be se
cured.
A second resolution as follows was
wired:
Resolved, That we regret the sale of the
property at 1037 Market street hy the proper
authorities without consulting the local com
mission In charge of said property.
The meeting went even further than
to pass the foregoing resolutions and
decided that legal notice be given to
Louis Friedman, Friedman & Rogers,
J. A. Jones and the Bank of California
that the legal rights to the property
1037 Market street rest with the Meth
odist Episcopal church and that Eaton
& Mains hold the title thereto in trust
for the church. These persons and
firms are further to be notified "that
the General Conference of the Metho
dist Episcopal church is the supreme
authority in and of said church, and
by resolution of said General Confer
ence at the session of 1900 a local com
mission was constituted of seven mem
bers and vested with the full manage
ment and control of the business of
the depository at San Francisco and
with charge of all the property of the
Book Concern in California. This was
confirmed by the General Conference
of 1904 held in Los Angeles."
The local commission declares that
it has not authorized or consented to
thÂ« sale and Jones, the agent, and the
Bank of California are particularly
notified not to deliver to Louis Fried
man or any one any deed conveying
the property.
If the Bank of California has re
ceived any money it is to be warned
not to give it over to any one but the
local commission. Louis Friedman and
Friedman & Rogers will be informed
that "Homer Eaton. George P. Mains
and the Methodist Book Concern have
not afiy right, authority or power to
grant or convey the premises or deliver
any deed purporting to convey the
property, nor has either of them any
right, power or authority to receive
any money as the purchase price of
the said property. They are further
notified that any sums that may be
paid by them will be at their own risk
and peril."
This notice is signed by C. B. Perkins,
secretary of the local commission. The
commission consists of Rolla V. Watt,
C. B. Perkins, Dr. C. F. Miller, Dr. E.
R. Dille. Dr. E. P. Dennett. A. J. Wal
lace and Dr. F. D. Bovard.
Among the indignant protestants is
the Rev. C. V. Anthony, who was one
of the committee that purchased the
property in 1875. Mr. Anthony wrotfc
a scathing denunciation of the act of
the New York Book Concern.
During the meeting a letter from
Nathaniel T. Coulson was submitted,
declaring that he had offered an ad
vance on the price paid for the prem
ises. It is said that Coulson's offer is
$135,000 while the price to be paid by
Friedman is $125,000.
The matter is causing no little anx
iety to those concerned. There are
those who believe that the New York
men had not the least legal right to
dispose of the property without the
consent of the California Commission,
while others unwillingly aver that th*
Eastern men possess the right to effect
the sale in the manner which they have
followed.

BRINGS SUIT
Wants Damages From Isaiah
H. Smith, W T ho Married
Her Very Wealthy Mistress
â ââ¦
CUPID - CKOESUS CASE
â¢
Husband of Mrs. Keating of
Pasadena Said to Have
Loved and Then Run Away
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 30.âAs a sequel
to a most sensational marriage last
October, when Isaiah H. Smith, a house
painter, married Mrs. Isabella Keating,
widow of Andrew J. W. Keating, who
left her $2,000,000, a breach of promise
suit was filed to-day against Smith by
Miss Mary Kelly.
Smith's $2,000,000 wife is 22 years
his senior. She . requires him to pay
her $25 a month board and lodging out
of the $80 a month he earns by paint
ing houses. Now Smith's former
sweetheart wants $10,000 for breach
of promise of marriage.
According to the allegations con
tained in the complaint, Smith and
Miss Kelly were to have been married
on October 26, but on that day Smith
was married to the millionaire widow
whose fortune was more alluring
than the beauty of the maid, who
then held the humble position of
housekeeper to the widow. It mat
tered not that his bride, who is the
mother of twelve children, has sons
as old as himself.
Soon after his marriage he found that
he was not to participate in the joys
which fortune is supposed to provide.
Prior to the filing of the suit an effort
was made to effect a compromise, but
Smith found that he had only his
wages with which to pay Miss Kelly,
for his wife would not help him. Then
followed the filing of the suit.
DEATH CALLS VETERAN.
J. N. Patrick, Who Raised First Ne
braska Regiment, Succumbs.
OMAHA, Jan. 30.â J. N. H. Patrick,
a Nebraska pioneer, is dead. He was
70 years of age. Patrick raised the
first Nebraska Regiment at the out
break of the Civil War, through which
he served, attaining the rank of col
onel. Later he distinguished himself
in battles with the Indians on the
frontier and was for several years a
Government director of the Union Pa
cific. He had amassed considerable
wealth.
Central.
The Central stock company seemed
at home again last night in a melo
drama by Kremer called "A Prisoner
of War." Jumping from a Biblical play
to the scenic sensation that Kremer is
able to produce would not be attempt
ed by an ordinary stock company, but
that is where the Central differs from
most of the othersâit is not an or
dinary company. Any one would have
thought from the smooth way In which
the performance ran that it had been
in rehearsal for weeks. As a melo
drama of the exciting type, Kremer's
latest production is certainly a winner.
It has more thrills and laughs than
most of the plays.written, and, having
for its theme plot the war that is
raging in the Far East, the interest
was held from the beginning. The story
is one of merit, the scenery, in partic
ular tlie third act, is quite the best
that has been* painted here In years,
and the costumes all the way through
are artistically beautiful." Miss Crosby
and Herschel Mayall divide the hon
ors in the leading parts. While not
offering the opportunity that Madam
Butterfly v did. one could see the
spark of genius leap through Juliet
< 'rosby's lines, and she strengthened
ihe role immeasurably by her artistic
work. She has irresistible magnetism
and delicate charm that always makes
her popular. Mayall looked to good
advantage. He was in the atmosphere,
and there are few better actors than
HersÃhel Mayall when he is fittingly
cast. The surprise of the evening was
little Viola Lambert, a young ingenue,
who Jumped into the part on a day's
notice and did acceptable work. There
is a bright future ahead of this clever
3 r oung girl. Harry Shumer gave fur
t!ieir evidence of his well-defined his
trionic ability, and, with James Cor
rigan, Ernest Howell and Julia Blanc,
helped carry through one of the most
exciting melodramas ever produced at
the Central.

Cotton and Japanese Bonds.
Brokers' wires from New York yesterday
eaid:
"The rise In Japanese bonds last week waa
one of the general principles of the financial
situation. Tbe advance in the bonds and the
heavy transactions in them point to the great
popular Interest that has been taken in them,
while' giving proof that they are regarded as
a safe Investment, even though these condi
tions reutrn 6% per cent.
"In cotton the general opinion here is that
large shorts have covered their lines and are
playing the long side at the moment. It
seems now' that the farmers have the better
of the situation, and if they can only hold out
this will no doubt govern prices to a certain
extent for the rest of this crop, aa there ls
every effort being made by the bankers and
financial Institutions generally to assist them
in their holdings."

New Y"ork Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 80.âThere was great
variety In to-day's stock market, with large
dealings and wide, constant fluctuations, but
the net changes do not In any degree corre
spond with the wide movements of tbe day.
Tho mainspring of tbe speculation was the
action of the Supreme Court in the Northern
Securities case. "Last week's buoyant rise in
the stocks which have responded to the va
rious developments In the Northern Securities
case waa associated with a general conviction
in Wall street that the court had reached the
determination to refuse the petition of the
Harriman party for a writ of certiorari to re
view the deoision against them In the lower
courts. By permitting the Immediate distri
bution of Northern Securities assets, such ac
tion by the court, It was felt, would prac
tically determine the contest. The anomaly
of strength shown by the stocks of both sides
to the contest on accojnt of a decision which
would be a defeat for one side apparently es
caped notice. The movement of the stocks to
day seemed to demonstrate by their final ac
tion that their advance has not been influenced
by consideration of a decision In the Northern
Securities. But it was shown also that there
had been a large speculative following In this
stock, which supposed that this was the in
fluence that moved them. Thus, there was
again heavy unloading when it became known
that the action of the Supreme Court would
have the efTeot of continuing the Injunction
under whioh the Northern Securities Company
ls tied up. That stock itself fell back nearly
8 points on the curb, and Union Pacific,
Southern Pacific and St. Paul were acutely
affected on the exchange. The determined ac
cumulation of Union Pacific at the lower lev
els and Its vigorous movement upward again
pointed to other causes for the advance and
the mysterious power of the railroad "deal"
again asserted Itself on the speculation ter
n Union Pacific, St. Paul, Southern Pacific,
Chicago and Northwestern and allied stocks.
Erie, New York Central, the Vanderbflts and
Kansas City Southern were all influenced im
mediately by the supposition of the deal. Dis
claimer of the deal stories, said to be with
oificial sanction but anonymously reported,
had no effect on that speculative excitement.
Outside of this Influence there were no clearly
defined factors In the market. There was
sr>me disposition to attribute the strong re
covery to the retreat of the bear interest
which has made demonstration against the
market for some time past. The special
strength of Amalgamated Copper was attrib
uted to this cause. Interviews with railroad
traffic officials pointed to slight interruption
of the freight movement by last week's storm
obstruction and the merchandise movement
was sold to be well maintained. Foreign fac
tors fell Into the background. Money was
again very easy and the prospects of large ad
ditional exports of gold caused no disturbance.
Except for the Harrtmans and Va-idere>itts
there were not many stocks that recovered
above Saturday. The closing waa steady and
not very far from the average of Saturday's
level.
Bonds continued to be well absorbed both
on the Stock Exchange and over the counter,
but depression of some of the speculative Is
sues made the movement Irregular. Total
sales, $7,475,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

CHICAGO BOARD OP TRABxt
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 80.âStrength developed in
tbe wheat pit after a weak opening. At the
start the market was bearish ly affected hy
lower prices at Liverpool and the weekly '
statistics, which were quite disappointing to i
bulls. The amount of breadstuA*s on ocean
passage showed an Increase of 1,385,000 bush- !
els. In addition, the world's shipments were
larger than expected. Furthermore the domes
tic situation was less reassuring to bull traders I
receipts In the Northwest being in excess of
those of the corresponding day a year ago.
After opening at $1 15%Â©1 16%, May declined
to $1 15% on general selling. During the
early part of the session there was very little
demand. As a result trading was inclined to
drag. Later more activity was manifested In
consequence of a better demand for cash
wheat, both In the Southwest and Northwest.
At Minneapolis sales of Aour were reported as
being heavier than for some time past. This
gave additional zest to speculative trading.
On covering by shorts, prices were forced
steadily upward, the market closing at the
highest point, of the day, with May at $1 16%
Â®1 16%.
Owing to prospects of a more liberal move
ment, sentiment in the corn pit was rather
weak. May opened %Â®%c lower at 44%Â®
44% c to 44% c, closing at 44%@44%c.
Business in the oats pit was much livelier
than has been In evidence for the last month.
â  May or>Â°ned unchanged to a shade lower at
80%Â®30%e and closed at 30%Â®30%c.
Notwithstanding lower prices at the yards,
| following heavier receipts of hogs than ex-
I pected, the provisions market was Arm the
I entire day. At the close May pork was up
7%Â©10 c, lard was 5c higher and ribs were up
2%Â®5c.

good movement was' noted In the cheapt â¢

being the principal buyers, both In the open

offerings were large. Stocks were too heavy,
however, to permit of any adva-ae in prices,
and conditions were still In favoi of the buy
ing interests. There was very l.'.tle inquiry
for fancy fruit, retailers refusing to take any
more of that grade than necessary for Imme
diate wants. In the auction rooms seven car
load? of Navels, chiefly low-grade fruit, were
sold, fancy selling at $1 1001 60; choice at $1

Increased by nine carloads of assorted stock
from the north and the market was weak for
the general run of offerings. The top quota
tion was generally regarded as an extreme
figure for the best offerings of the Ben Davis
variety. Fancy Newtown Pippins and Spltzen
bergs would have brought moro had there been
any of those varieties available.

STOCK MARKET.
Trading Active, With Some Sharp
Fluctuations.
There were several very sharp fluctuations
in local securities on the Bond Exchange yea
terday. One waa In Contra Costa Water,
which advanced from $3160, as Saturday's
closing quotation, to $37. This stock will be
apt to exhibit more or lees irregularity for
some time, pending the election In Oakland
on March 11 to decide on the municipal own
ership of a water plant. Another wide fluctu
ation was in Hawaiian Commercial, which
sold down to $89, against a closing price on
Saturday of $92 75. Profit taking was given
by tho brokers as the reason for the decline
in this stock. Changes in the other sugars
were 6light. HutchinÃon decltned .from $17%
to $17 50. and Paauhau was 50c off at $27 50Â®
27. while Onomea was higher at $39 7f>'tf39%,
falling figures. This â¢ group was generally
weaker in the afternoon than in the forenoon.
Gas and Electric was lower at $53 and Alaska
Packers also, at $80 bid, $83 asked, at the
close. There was a good business on this
exchange in bonds, which sold to the amount
of $89,500.
There was no particular change in the Com- j
stock mining shares, which were generally
firm and fairly active. The Tonopahs, which
were active were distinguished by a rise in
Tonopah Midway from 61c, as Saturday's
closing price, to 96c, though the stock closed
off at 90c bid. Other higher Tonopahs wero
MacNamara and Montana Tonopah, as will
be seen.
The Hale A Norcross Mining Company has
levied an assessment of 10c per share, delin
quent March 7.
The Pacific Coast Borax Company paid a
regular monthly dividend of $1 per share, or
$19,000, yesterday.
The directors of the Union Oil Company have
declared a series of monthly. dividends at the
rate of 50c per share, to remain in force until
further notice. This will amount to 6 per
cent ocr annum on the par value of the
The Oil City Petroleum Company has de T
dared a monthly dividend of %c per share,
payable on February 1. Twenty-Eight OH

same date.

PLAN TO FIGHT
PARTY BOSSES
Many Tax-Paying Citizens
Are Quite Ready for a
Non-Pa rt i sau Movement
METHOD OF NOMINATION
An Independent Convention
Relying on a Petition for
Place on Official Ballot
Taxpaylng citizens of every calling
and in every Assembly district of the
city are considering the advisability of
putting forward a purely non-partisan
ticket In the next municipal campaign
in San Francisco.
It is said by the taxpayers of all par.
ties that something must be* done to
promote b-t-tter government in local af
fairs. Citizens who are desperately in
earnest talk of vigilance committee or
ganization to redeem the city, but con
servative, .irogreseive men are. of the
opinion that such heroic measures will
not be necessary provided a fair deal
can be had in the casting and counting
of the vote.
The existing election laws provide a
method of creating nominating conven
tions by delegates chosen at primary
â¢lections. The framers of the law had
the notloi that the people of each As
sembly district would elect the best
men as delegates and that the result
would be the nomination in the con-'
vehtion of men who did not owe alle
giance to the political bosses. A lead
ing citizen who strongly favors a non
partisan movement remarks:
The primary Hectloii law Is good In a *ay,
but the bosses by control of the party works
and the machinsry of election can, with the
assistance uf the Registrar of Voters and the
"Blection Commissioners, defeat the real pur
pose of legislation which was framed to place
the power in the bands of the people. At
first glance it would seem to be easy enough
for the independent Republicans In the several
Assembly districts to put up delegates free
from boss influence and thus gain control
of the nominating convention.
A similar victory might be achieved by In
dependent anti-boss Democrats. A proposition
to merge the two conventions thus created if
frequently advanced, but it ls doubtful whether
the two parties could agree on a division of
the nominating patronage. The placing in
the field of two tickets representing "ie In
terests of good government would give the
bosses just the opportunity they desire.
It Is well understood that the Ruef-Schmltz
machine of the Union Labor party works side
by side with the Ru'ef-Herrin machine of the
Republican party, and either machine can ba
reinforced in an emergency by the Hearst-
O'Brien forces of the Democratic party. The
regular Democratic forces under the leader
ship of McNab, Lane and Phelan are badly
demoralized by defeat and dissension. It Is
doubtful whether the people would support
nominations emanating from that faction of
the Democratic party.
The simple, straightforward way ls to create
a non-partisan convention representing all
elements of citizenship and when that
convention nominates a ticket have the names !
placed or *he official hallot by petition. It
will be "aiier' to mind that the convention
at Metropolitan Hall, which gave Eugene E.
Schmitz his iti t n. mination for Mayor, was
not composed Â«f d'.egates chosen at the pri
mary election. r r.e delegates to the nomlnat- I
ing body were appointed by labor unions and i
industrial organizations throughout the city. :
It wmiM be feasible for the Merchants' As
sociation at large and Independent clubs In !
the several districts cf the city to send dele- 1
gates to a non-partisan convention. No doubt !
many of the labor unions would send repre- j
sentatives. In a general sense the convention |
should reflect the views of the tax-paying and j
industrial citizenship of San Francisco.
Citizens who have determined to join !
a non-partisan movement Bhould bear
In mind that participation in a primary
Slection for delegates to a party nom
inating convention will disqualify them j
from the right to petition to place a'
name on the official ballot, hence the I
suggestion is made that the taxpayers |
take no hand whatever in the primary
election for delegates to a municipal
nominating convention.

By. the signing of the agreement be

industrial peace on the local railroads i
is assured for two years from next !

which the managers held out forâof j
the right to engage men on the cars !
Irrespective of union affiliation. By j
these conditions a mild open shop pol
icy stands. There is to be no discrim
ination for or against a man seeking
employment whether he is a union man j
.Â»r not. .As a matter of course, the '
union would prefer to have none em- j
ployed but union hands. On this Issue !
there was a good deal of friendly ex- i
change of opinions between the parties !
to the agreement, but as the managers i
expressed themselves free to permit any

to join the union if they saw fit the
further discussion was abandoned and
the agreement obtained the signatures

instructed Secretary Wisler to com- j
municate these facts to State Senator
Keane and urge him to oppose the
passage of the bill.
A similar line of opposition is made
an issue by the District Council of Car- !
penters against the passage of Senator I
Ralston's anti-boycott bill. To head off
the passage of this measure Delegate
Saunders was dispatched to Sacra
mento with instructions to defeat the
bill if possible, as being unfavorable to j

CHINESE PHARMACIST'S
PRACTICE IS ILLEGAL
* - â¢
Honorable Court Gives Stay
c
BY .JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Not until she had tried and found
wanting all the regulation schools of
medicineâallopathy, homeopathy,
osteopathy and several other pathies,
to say nothing of magnetic healing and
Christian Scienceâdid Mrs. R. H.
Anderson of 241 Oak street convey
her ailment to Han You of 783 Mar
ket street and have it diagnosed and
prescribed for by that eminent scien
tist. Prior to submitting her case to
him, however, she inquired if he was
a legally authorized druggist, and in
response he exhibited to her a license
bearing the Tax Collector's signature,
which showed that he had paid to that
official the sum of $Â£5 and had re
ceived in return the document dis
played, which was equivalent, he ex
plained, to a certificate issued by the
State Board of Pharmacy. Consider
ing herself sufficiently safeguarded by
law, she instructed him to go ahead
with his treatment.
The ingredients of the compounds
which he put up and sold to her she
did not know, but supposed they were
quite as safe as the stuff prescribed by
his predecessors in her case. He was
heavily and variously stocked with
herbs, some of which looked like.dried
sagebrush roots, while others were
suggestive of secondhand tea leaves,
and he was also long on reptilian spe
cifics, such as desiccated tarantula, oil
of centipede, blood of Gila monster,
extract of lizard and crocodile tears
distilled. These rwings might not be
agreeable to think of consuming, but
they assuredly could not be less ef
fective than any of the more eupho
nious and alliterative-titled proprie
tary articles she had previously ex
perimented with, including Pale Pills
for Pink Patients, Roarer's Ready Re
lief and Mother Maginnis' Magenta
Makesure, each advertised as infallible
and all proved failures.
It was not pleasant, therefore, for
Mrs. Anderson to ascertain that the
legality of Han You's practice was
questioned and that she was expected
tf; appear befo-e Police Judge Mogan
and testify as to her dealings with
him. Disappointing as her experience
with the Caucasian doctors and drug
gists had been, none of them had been
instrumental in dragging her into
court to relate her physical Ills.
In the. face of the most honorable
court Han You flourished the docu
ment which he had displayed to Mrs.
Anderson as his pharmacist's license,
but the attorney for the State Phar
macy Board was ready with proof that
the Tax Collector had never written
the signature thereto appended. He
was rather sorry fpr Han You, was the
attorney, but the general public and
the profession of pharmacy must be
protected.
Then it was that-Han Tou begged
that most honorable court to believe
he had paid the $25 acknowledged In
the false license, ana that the re
cipient of the money was a young
man who represented himself as a
deputy Tax Collector. But, alas! It was
evident that he (Han You) had been
victimized by a swindler. Would the
most honorable court continue the
hearing of this most miserable case
until after the Chinese new year, as
the defendant, although innocent of
Intent to violate the laws of this land,
might possibly be convicted of having
violated them, and he did not desire
to have the stain of such conviction on
his: character during Ihe season of
good-will among his countrymen?
The most honorable court did most
considerately grant" Han You's request,
and the next hearing of the case is
set for February 6.
â¢ â¢ â¢
By thrusting Teutonic music upon a
Latin auditory the merchants doing
business in the vicinity of Stockton
street's Junction with Montgomery
avenue primarily provoked the dis
orderly conduct for which Emile
FJsinlo, Joseph Taboni and Peter
Caito were arrested last Saturday af
ternoon. The band was engaged for
the purpose of attracting the atten
tion of North End residents to the fact
that they could save money by shop
ping in their own neighborhood in
stead of downtown, and the experi
ment would doubtless have been suc
cessful if Its projectors had only con
sidered that the Italian quarter is in
the North End and had engaged
Italian instead of German instru
mentalists. But what else than dis
order could have been expected when
Rossini and Verdi and Puccini and
Mascagnl were ignored and Mozart
and Beethoven and Wagner were in
terpreted. If the programme had only
been mixed or even confined to Amer
ican, English or French composers by
way of compromise the potato and
onion throwing might have been
averted. But to play German selec
tions and nothing else was simply akin
to waving a red flag in the face of a
bull. When the audience clamored
for bread they .were given stories.
They asked for "11 Trovatore" cad
the response was "Die Gotterdam
merung." A request for Mascagni's
"Intermezzo" was answered with
"Mine Lieber Schwan." from "Lohen

grin." Then the missiles began to fly.
An onion choked the slide trombone j
and a fusillade of potatoes rattled I
upon the bass drum, thereby injecting !
discord into the tempo. The bassoon |
was so filled with potatoes and onions';
that its operator was obliged to invert'
j his instrument to discharge cargo, j
When an onion smote the leader full |
on his forehead he silently breathed i
gratitude that the high price off eggs i
prevented their utilization by the ar- \
tillerists. Not, however, until the B j
flat corrtet was plugged with an onion j
that defied extraction did the , band |
cease striving to deliver its goods.
Of the mob of missile throwers j
only the trio hereinbefore named,were j
captured by Patrolr. ~.n F. A. Ma- j
honey, who is attached to neither the â 
German nor the Italian school of i
j music, but simply did his duty as a |
( peace preserver. His testimony con- i
' vlcted the defendants of disorderly ;
j conduct, and they will be sentenced \
I to-day by Judge Mogan.

cific street, near Montgomery avenue.

Waller Seger, of Wavonic birth and
breeding, obstructed a portion of Third â¢
street by allowing his peddler wagon
to stand there, and when Patrolman
Winxler told him to move on he de- i
clined to do so, declaring that this was
a free country. Judge Cabaniss coin- !
cided with that declaration, but re
minded Mr. Seger that the freedom !
of the individual could not legally be i
allowed to hamper with Jhe freedom
of the community. Then ass fine was
imposed.
Mrs. Sarah O'Dowd suggested that
Judge Cabaniss severely punish Alonzo

Interesting Address on

Employes of the City
Manila as it is to-day was graph
ically described by Father Joseph P.
McQuaide last night, at a campfire
given by Camp Nelson A. Miles of the
United Spanish-American War Veter
ans at Native Sons' Hall,
As the priest mentioned familiar
landmarks of the Filipino capital the
audience, for the most part veterans of
the first unpleasantness in the Islands,
audibly expressed their interest.
"The four-municipal departments of
Manila are as good as any in the
world," declared Father McQuaide. He
said in part:
Tlie Fire Department ls such that it excites
the admiration of English and German visitors.
If any of you should go toacit there you would
be surprised at how much those Filipinos have
been taught. The Police Department has iIOO
constables. They ttalk about with their heads
up, displaying a lot of -nerve. (I thought It
gall.) I saw cnc American soldier who bad
smoked too many cigars being arrested. He
looked at the little rilipino policeman and
said, "If you don't go nome I will kick you."
In a minute Aye or six little policemen grabbed
him and escorted him to the calabozo.
The Heaith Department is a well organized
body. It has Its plumbing inspectors, food in
spectors, milk Inspectors and Its rat catchers.
I saw a company of this profession marching 1
In a municipal parade with their traps In
their hands.
The School Department is admirably handled
by our old comrade, General James F. Smith. ;
The little Filipinos take to American methods
rapidly. They are great baseball "fans." I !
saw one little fellow who could pitch curves
that were certainly better man I could pitch.
There is a fine new bridge across the Pasig
leading to what I always thought would be j
New Manila, that territory between the river
and Malate. Tho botanical gardens are real 1
botanical gardens now, and a new City Hall
Is built near them. But Manila ls not the Ma
nila of our time. It costs money to live there
now. If you ever take a trip there you will
be more than glad to get home.
An interesting programme was ren
iered before the priest gave his inter
esting talk. Dr. Riqhardson and W. S.

O'Dowd family dog had made it ex
tremely annoying, not to say dangerous,
for his young daughter to walk abroad.
The animal had a penchant for pur
suing Miss Marlin and snapping at her
heels, and only her superior agility pre
vented the insertion of his teeth in her
limbs. As for shooting at chickens,
i Mr. Marlin had never done that, be
cause the birds had not antagonized
kirn.
"You're a liar!" promptly and loud
ly explained Mrs. O'Dowd, addressing
Mr. Marlin, and when the court recov
ered from the shock conveyed to it by
the expletive it dismissed the charge
against Mr. Marlin and severely re
proved Mrs. O'Dowd.
"For your language here this day,"
said his Honor to the latter, "has suf
ficed to convince me that you indulge
;in ungentle language out of court."
Mrs. Louisa Bottomey, a tall and
freckled matron, testified that never in
all her born days had she seen a family
so persecuted as were the Marlins by
the O'Dc-wds.

! last night, and the house full of laugh

"The Dictator." Richard Harding Da
! vis out of his tuxedo is both a human
' and delightfully funny person. There
I is not a touch of the painful pink tea.
ness of "The Taming Cf Helen" in the
Davis of "The Dictajor," not a smack
of reminder of that amiable but won
-1 derfully artificial person. Mr. Davis
here gets down to fun, sheer, up-to-the-
I minute fun of the best, and thoroughly
! original. It is essentially Willie Col
lier's kind of fun. The playwright has
fitted Mr. Collier with a role for which
the actor shows every sign of grati
, tude; the rest of the gratitude Is ours
i for the farce.
What Mr. Collier has to do ls exactly
1 what he does so delightfully. He is
i Brooke Travers in the farce, an aver
age rich New Yorker, who, believing
i that he has murdered a cabman, flees
ito South America with his valet. We
find him first on the steamer, just be
fore Its landing in Porto Banos. One
of his fellow passengers Is Colonel
i John T. Bowie of unsavory record,
who is goipg to Porto Banos as the
American Consul. Travers buys the
' consulship and Incidentally an able
bodied revolution, an impassioned love
of other days and a few other trifles
from Bowie. The next act finds Trav
ers among them, and In the midst of
the facile tarradiddllng in which Mr.
Collier is at his funniest.
One hardly knows Just where the
actor was most engaging. His scene of
Introduction to the newest Governor,
a terrifically bewhlskered person with
small respect for consuls and things,
ls distinctly hilarious, and Mr. Collier,
hand thrust In the bosom of his cOat,
Abraham Lincoln wise, a picture not to
be forgotten. One likes him again con
fronted with the tropical former love
of Colonel Bowie, who has. however,
transferred her affections to a mis
sionary. One likes him when he is
buying up the soldiers at thirty sente
apiece, and. in fact, one likes Mr. Col
lier through ail the highly ingenious
stuff Mr. Davis gives him to do. He Is
essentially the practical, matter-of
fact New Yorker, plunged into a deli
ciously incongruous romance, and his
work ls still the deftest, neatest, smart
est of farce-comedy.
Travers is not the only well-made
figure in the piece. Indeed, its dozen
or so all stand on their own legs. Nor
could they be better acted than by Mr.
Collier's company. Travers' valet, who
has only less to do than Travers, is
capitally acted by Charles Jackson,
who gets a most entertaining mixture
of servility and cowardice into the
character. And If there are any more
BarrymoreÃ we want them. Mr. Col
lier brings one, "John" Barrymore on
the programme, off it, Jack. Mr. Bar
rymore honors the family traditions.
His sister Ethel modestly hinted as
much. She did not tell us Just how
much. However. John Barrymore as
the pessimistic wireless telegraph oper
ator, who ls sent down to take the
place of the operator that died of yel
low fever, Is distinctly one of the hits
of the piece.
The women are Just as good. There
are only three of them, but they do
everything necessary. Louise Allen
has the part of the Porto Banos lady
love of Bowie, and the characteriza
tion from the accent down is stunning.
Miss Allen both looks and acts the
part With entire conviction and in the
best spirit of farce comedy. As Lucy
Sheridan, the young woman mission
ary that Travers falls in love with oh
his way down to Porta Banos, Rose
Flynn is sincere and charming, and
Lida Hall fulfills all the need of her
small part.
The rest of the cast, the revolution
ists, soldiers, sailors, are all efficient;
the farce admirably staged and "The
Dictator," in short, to be enjoyed to
tears by any one in search of a laugh.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
â  m Alhambra.
Creatore and his Italian band came,
saw and conquered at th> Alhambra
last evening. Creatore brought with
him all the remembered abundance of
gesticulation, the abounding enthusi
asm that made him practically in all
parts of the stage at once, the same
wealth of hair. Massed before him on
the stage was a collection of perform
| ers that justly deserve to be styled
superb. There was no vocalist, Mmc,
| Barili being reserved for this evening]
: but there was instrumental solo work
|of high class.
Creatore started with the great
march from "Tannhaussr," which he
I conducted in a way that was entirely
| original and not beyond criticism, not
| withstanding that his varied tempo
l was not inconsistent with a great
j amount of snap and dash. When,
' however, he reached the second num
j ber on the programme, the overture
!to "Mignon," the leading theme, the
| pclacca, was given splendidly. Loud
! cheers resounded from all parts of the
; house by reason of his success in this.
|An encore was demanded and there
| were frequent encores after that; in
' fact the length of the programme was
; nearly doubled thereby.
I The first part also included Pad
erewski's somewhat hackneyed minuet
, and an organ offertory by Batist;.
I The last served well to test the all
; around excellence of the various parts
|of the band, the brass, the wood wind,
the saxophones. The test revealed
great strength in the brass. The
wood wind was also strong, especially
in a fine body of clarinets, that later
proved .their efficiency even more po
tently in a rapid and intricate passage
in unison. The Batiste number again
brought cheers.
In the second part the quartet
from "Rigoletto" gave way to the sex
tette from "Lucia," which was substi
tuted by request. Six instrumental
soloists came to the front. Here it
was that the Tommasino, Sementa,
Picclrillo, Catalano, laflsco and Glovs
shone, with the entire band for an en
semble.
Later Signor Sodero won successive
encores for his harp solos. Sodero is
very skillful. He is among the best
of harpists.
The great applause of the evening
came for the "Carmen" numbers, in
which* the soloists already mentioned
and- Signor Raho were conspicuous.
The band is absolutely under control,
perfectly responsive, made up of men
who play together with unerring cer
tainty of tempo and tonal effects and
with sonorous and satisfying volume.
It Is better on the whole than ever be
fore. To-night a rich programme will
b* afforded.
Alcazar.
The first stock production of Pin
ero's comedy, "The Gay Lord Quex,"
by the Alcazar company was an event
greeted last night by an appreciative
and highly pleased audience, most of
whose members had seen the same
play produced under Henry Miller's
management and upon a more preten
tious stage. But the unanimous ver
dict last night was, in spite of com
parisons, that as good a performance
in every respect could be en'oyed t
much less than $2 per seat when fur
nished forth by the Alcazar company.
The management intended that the
production of this play should be a
white milestone of progress along the
dramatic highway and that intention
was made fact. The performance
certainly could stand comparison in
the limelight with the best of its
predecessors.
The staging of the play was elab
orate, every detail being worked up to
the ultimate. Nothing of accessory
waj lacking and it was plain that
neither cost nor pains were regarded.
When the curtains rolled away from
the romantic scene in the second act
Lady Owbrldge's Italian garden,
there was a spontaneous burst of ap
plause from the delighted spectators.
With such an environment it was easy .
for the excellent company to do good
acting. Without a hitch or a stammer
the comedy proceeded from the open
ing until the close, the actors seeming
to be imbued with the spirit of their
surroundings. John Craig was never
happier than in his personation of the
Marquis of Quex, and the same may
be truthfully said of the work of Lil
lian Lawrence as the manicure artist.
Miss Sophia Fullgarney. John B. Ma
her avoided in the role of Sir Chiches
ter the ultra decrepitude that has been
his only blemish in his other roles,
and contributed a generous share to
the hilarity. Harry Hilllard was ap
propriately earnest in his personation
of Valma the palmist. Adele Bel
garde played the Duchess of Strood
with all the romance intended by the
author, and Elizabeth Woodson was
appropriately grave and gay by turns
in the character of Muriel. The Alca
zar has made a record breaking hit.
Grand Opera-House.
J. H. Stoddart repeated his splen
did performance of Lachlan Campbell
In "The Bonnie Brier Bush" to a large
audience last night at the Grand Op
era-house. The veteran actor was re
ceived with enthusiasm. The verdict
seems to be that his performance of
the role is the best he has ever given.
Reuben Fax scored a great triumph as
the bibulous Scottish postman,
"Posty." Mr. Fax's impersonation of
this exacting role stamps him as a
fine character actor. To-night the
Manchester Unity Lodge of Odd Fel
lows will attend the theater in a body
in honor of J. Palmer Collins, one of
their fraternity. Friday night the
Clan Fraser and other Scotch socie
ties will patronize the theater.
Many more Scotch features will
be introduced for the occasion.
Saturday night will positively be
the last time Mr. Stoddart will ap
pear on a San Francisco stage. Next
Monday night Klaw & Erlanger's
mighty beauty spectacle, "Mother
Goose," will be seen for the first time
in this city.
The Chutes.
Hyde and Heath, a couple of sweet
voiced dancing comedians, made their
first appearance at the Chutes yester
day, presenting "A Load of Hay," a
"skit full of clever work. Mr. and Mrs.
John T. Chick in their Original com
edietta, "Matrimonial Troubles,"
scored a hit at both performances.
Marie Heath, a buxom Irish come
dienne, was warmly applauded for her
rollicking ditties. The Star trio, com
posed of Jennings O'Brien, Horace
Mann and Cad Franks, in th?ir hilar
ious absurdity, "Our Uncle"; Mabel
Lamson, the popular singer of illus
trated songs, and the American bio
graph, showing several sensations in
the moving picture line, completed a
capital programme. The women's
wood sawing contest, which has
proven so amusing on recent amateur
nights, will be repeated on Thursday
