ST. PETERSBURG, May 6, 3:30 a. ml
Neither the â¢ Admiralty nor the War
Offic* believes that a disembarkation'
of the Japanese on Llaotung Peninsula
can be prevented, as the guns -of. the
Japanese cruisers .could command the
point of landing, but* after the Japanese
arc ashore the Russians will strike.
What force they will be able to bring
up to resist the invaders cannot be
stated definitely, the strength- of ( the
army on the peninsula of. Liaotuns
having been kept a strict secret.
.It Is expected the railroad- will. play
an important part in the effort "of the
Russians to push the Japanese into the
sea, as it will permit the rapid trans
portation of trooDs.
The general staff . has not .forgotten
that Japanese ships were sighted, on
May 3 off Kaiping and Sin^tchen, on
the west coastof the Liaqtung Penin
sula, but these, two points could ' be
readily covered/"" if necessary, - from
Newchwang. '. *- â¢

A landing at this moment would
make it difficult for General Kuropat
kin to concentrate a formidable ! force
against General Kuroki, whose forward
movement is not yet reported. Further
more, once the Japanese -are across the
railroad Port Arthur will be as good
as besieged. ,
â¢Av member of the general staff says
that General. Kuropatkin is well aware
of these : considerations. Even -if the
Japanese should succeed in cutting the
railroad Port Arthur is now ready to
depend upon its own resources.
Dispatches from Tokio telling of cele
brations over the sealing of Port Ar
thur, it is stated, are premature, of
ficial advices establishing beyond ques
tion that the attempt of Vice Admiral
Togo on May 3 to seal the port failed^
â¢ The absence . of press dispatches tell
ing :of the- fight- on the Yalu is par
tially explained by the heavy mortality
among-, the 'correspondents. Three of
the .â¢ Novosti's correspondents are miss

that stronghold, Russia hasbraced . Herself for impending, conflicts with' the foe in which- she will

peror has been informed of the presence of a Japanese fleet off the Liaoshan Promontory the',
appearance of. transports at Pitzwo. The fact' that the two events occurred simultaneously may

Miller was of a roving disposition.
Three years ago, when he was about

because George refused to take an In

ployment elsewhere. From time to

about a year ago hi3 father received
a letter in which he wrote that he was
iU in a California town, but an investi

there was no truth in the statement.
A few days ago a letter was received
by a friend I of the missing man in
Brooklyn which contained the newa
that Miller had been ill for a month
with typhoid fever in the Sacramento
hospital and had been near death. Ilia
letter was at once given to the at

The. public meeting for the benefit of
the Russian Red Cross Society at the
Native Sons' Hall last night, arranged
by the Slav- American committee of
San Francisco, was attended by a great
crowd of sympathizers with the Rus
sian cause. Speeches *were the order
of -the evening. Judge John F. Davis
and Samuel M, Shortridgre were the
forcible speakers and . their remarks
called out thunders of applause.
Baron W. E. von Johannsen acted as
chairman. . Shortridge, dwelt at length
on the question of gratitude that was
due to Russia from America for the
favors .we had received at her hand3.
He said there were two. nations that
were liberators. Russia was one and
America the other.
Judge. Davis made a speech of the
most stirring order, which set the au
dience boiling with enthusiasm.- He
said in part: â¢ â¢ â¢
Russia's cause Is founded on justice. And
now to-day, when, according to report, she
has suffered defeat, . I want to be considered
on" the Russian side. ' The friendship of Russia
fcr us has been of long Etanding. and we
should show Russia that we appreciate the
position she has always maintained toward
us. In the war of the revolution she was our
friend, and she was also the supporter of the
Union in the civil war. Â¦" .
In our war with Spain, when the Emjieror
of Austria suggested that there should be a
continental concert of all the European powers;
in regard- to considering the attitude that
America was taking in relation to Cuba, the
Crsr of llussla came out with a firm voice
and said: "'America is right. She Is only
fighting for Justice."
â¢ When we bought Alaska we paid $7,5OO,OCO
for it. This was no gale at all. Russia parted
â¢with Alaska because Â»he knew we had the
right o it. Think of the enormous amount of
gold, minerals and furs we have taken out of
that, country I Why, the $7,500,000 would not
even pay for the value cf the icefields there.
To develop her country she seeks an outlet to
the sea. and she ehould have it. People call
Russians expansionists. Are -we not the largest
expansionists on the face of the globe?

ST. PETERSBURG, May 5.â This haÂ»
been 'a day of all-around emotions.
Early in the morning the crowds
around the official bulletins read Gen
eral Kurupatkin's admission that the
Russian loss totaled 2000 men. The
public here Is strongly pessimistic and
insisted that the real number was be
ing concealed, as are the reports of
the large number of prisoners who
have fallen into the bands erf the Jap
anese. The sensation of the day was
the arrival here of a Gensan telegram
announcing that Russian ships were
supposed to be in collision with the
Japanese off that port. Pendent to it.
in the way of keeping popular emotion
at the highest pitch of suspense, came
a ten-word laconic telegram, datetl
Port Arthur, saying the enemy had ap
peared on the horizon, probably for a
fresh attack. 'â¢â¢ #
Stock Exchange rumors are rife or
something further wrong. . Simultan
eously heavy selling orders came froj"
larg" banking establishments, wltn tne
result that 4; per cents went down a
point and a half. Then came a Berlin
telegram saying that Japan had bougnt
eight transports from the Bremen Line
â not very pleasant news.
It appears now that the Russian
troops were to have retired on the
night after the day of the Japann.se
attack, without inviting a fight which
was felt to be desperate and useless.
The rapidity of the Japanese advance
waa unexpected. It is accepted tn mili
tary circles that the Japanese will soon
be able, profiting: by the Â«ase with
which they can now tmng supplies to
the Yalu. to take one or more of a
half-dozen routes open to them and
reach the railroad. At the same time
a landing party may co-operata with
. the army. One has been novering about
in transports for some time ;>ast at
i Takashan or thereabouts. Liaoyang is
j probably their objective point.
It is expected that a renewed ?-om
bardment of Port Arthur would be a
cover for the landing of a fresh aricy.
The ground toward the railway is in
; variably mountainous. This will give
I the Russian forces ample opportunities
i fc-r making the Japanese advance very
costly during the ten days which is the
possible time for a strong division to
reach Mukden.

it would work great injustice in the
case of batteries and regiments forced
by circumstances to sacrifice them
selves, as was the case' on Sundey.
EXTENT OF THE . LOSSES.
No further official news has been re
ceived regarding the Russian losses,
but General â¢ Kashtallnsky's estimate.
2000 men, is accepted as representing
practically their, full extent.
It i3 generally believed that the Jap
anese lost between 3000 and 4000 men.
This is based upon reports of eye-wit
nesses.
There has been absolutely no state
ment of the number of prisoners cap
tured by the Japanese, but the general
staff Is inclined to admit that 300 men
were captured, though the staff asserts
that it has no actual means of know
ing how many prisoners are in the
hands of the Japanese.
Not a single newspaper dispatch has
yet been received beyond the several
colorless telegrams from the Russian
headquarters at Liaoyang, which sim
ply repeat the official news.
Vice Admiral Dezbrazoff, who is to
command the first division of the Pa
cific fleet under Vice Admiral Skryd
loff. has left here for Port Arthur.
\The new Russian battleship Orel,
which ran aground on a sand bank in
tne Neva on May 1, has been, floated
and. taken to Kronstadt. Only a few
of her plates were damaged.
Viceroy Alexieff has left Port Arthur
to confer with General Kuropatkin . at
Liaoyang, to which place the general
will return Immediately after an in
spection of the .troops at Fengwang
cheng. Rear Admiral Wittsoeft, chief
of staff to Viceroy Alexieff, Tjas been
left in charge of the naval forces at
Port Arthur-
COMMENT OF THE PRESS.
The. Russian papers are rather spar-
Ing In their comment upon the battle
of Kuliencheng, evidently awaiting
more Complete details: but what they
say contains no traces of discourage
ment. . Â¦ .
The Novoe Vremya says the days
of patience announced by General Ku
ropatkin have now begun, and declares
that the Japanese difliculties will in
crease as they advance. The paper be
lieves the chief danger now is in the
attitude of the Chinese, and says:
"Our diplomats must make Peking
realize the danger of Chinese violation
of neutrality. Russia must win, but
with heavier sacrifices a heavier price
will be exacted from her enemies."
The Viedomosti remarks: "It is a
Japanese victory. Do not let us seek
for a scapegoat. It is the fortune of
war. Glory to the dead and to the sur
vivors of the heroic fight against over
whelming odds. But the ; Japanese
probably would gladly exchange their
dearly bought victory for a successful
bottling up of Port Arthur."
The Russky Invalid, the army organ,
points to the fact that 6000 Russians
rnn * c ! a rear ard battle against 30,
000 Schoengrabern (Austria) in 1805
and a century later 8000 Russians

Shipping Locomotives to .inpanV
PHILADELPHIA, May 5. â The
last of, twenty-four locomotives built
in a hurry in this city for the Japan
ese Government have been boxed and
sent to New York for shipment to the
Far East. Some of 4 *he locomotives
have been sent to Japan via San Fran
cisco. At the request of the Japanese
Government the utmost secrecy was
maintained in â¢ shipping the engines,
for. fear that they, might in some way
fall into the hands of the Russians.
LONDON, May 6.â Viceroy Alexieff's
departure from Port Arthur is inter
preted here to mean that that place Is
in immediate danger of . isolation and
that the Japanese -preparations for
landing are considered as confirming
the belief that Port Arthur has "been
sealed, probably by two of the sunken
ships which the Russians "failed to lo
cate." In this connection attention is
drawn to the discrepancy between the
Russian and Japanese accounts of the
attempt to "bottle" the port, the former
stating that it occurred about 3
o"clock In the morning, while the latter
said it took place in the afternoon. It
is suggested that there may have been
two separate attempts, each time with
ten ships. It will be remembered that
it had been previously asserted that
Japan prepared twenty, vessels for this
purpose, and if this explanation Is cor
rect the Russian accounts, referring
only to the early morning affair, may
be justified in asserting that it was un
successful.
It is supposed that the Japanese will
make a supreme effort to cut off Port
Arthur beforÂ« the arrival of Vice Ad
miral Skrydloff. According to the
Daiiy Telegraph's Tokio correspondent,
to-day's Jiji Shlmpo says:
"Our fleet has not yet returned to its
rendezvous and is still engaged in the
execution of a prearranged pro
gramme."
There is reason to believe that the
Japanese intend landing their second
army at Newchwang upon the success
ful bottling up of Port Arthur.
The Daily Mail's Paris correspondent
hears that Russia has canceled its con
tracts for a supply of coal en route to
the Far East, which were made with a
view to the dispatch of the Baltic fleet.
The Berlin correspondent of the
Daily Mall asserts that the Russian
military authorities are in a state of
extreme anxiety regarding the chances
of saving the baggage of the Yalu
army. The roads are so bad that
wheeled transport is able to move only
five miles a day, and- it is feared that
the Japanese will capture all the stores
accumulated at Fengwangcheng.
Dispatches received from Port Ar
thur yesterday afternoon and from
Newchwang on Wednesday report no
change in the situation, and so far no
confirmation has reached London of
the Japanese preparations for landing
on the coast of the Liaotung Peninsula.
According to the Daily Telegraph's
Shanhaikwan correspondent Pavloff,
Russian Minister to Korea, has gone to
Peking for the purpose of endeavoring
to Induce China to cede to the Russian
administration the . Chinese railways

Roth Russia and Japan Succeed In
Negotiating Heavy Loans.
LONDON, May 5. â Further inquiries
show that a Japanese loan of $50,000,000
will be issued next week. It will take
the form of seven-year 6 per cent
bonds, and the issue price probably
will be 93Â«4; the security being a
first charge on the Japanese customs.
The Joan will be Issued simultaneous
ly in New York and London.
Takahashi, the Japanese financial
agent in" London, said the money would
not be sent to Japan, but would be
employed .in paying the balance of
trade. He said that, in his opinion, no
other loans would be required by
Japan before the conclusion of the
war.
It was definitely arranged this aft
ernoon that half the Japanese loan
will go to the United States, and it
was understood that Kuhn, Loeb & Co.
would handle it in America. The Stock
Exchange put a nominal premium of
\Vz on the projected loan this after
noon. . -,
PARIS, May 5. â Persons connected
with the negotiations for the Russian
loan give the following statement^
"The loan is not yet signed, but' it
is certain that It* will not be long de
ferred. HottingTier, representing the,
French financiers, is now In St. Peters
burg arranging details. It is under
stood that it will be at 5 per cent for
five years and that it will sell at be
tween 98 and 98.50."
A representative of one of the banks
forming the syndicate underwriting
the loan said: - . " . . , â¢â¢â¢â¢;Â¦ '
"We consider the loan closed -in prin-i
ciple, but some details remain to be
settled. The amount will be $200,000,000,
and, as previously announced, at 5
per cent for five years. The selling
pri^e is slightly above 98. The entire
amount has already been taken. Be
sides the French banks, a number of
Belgian banks have subscribed. The
entire issue will be made at one time,
not in three parts, as reported.'. .
"The main detail, which Hottlnguer
isÂ» in St. Petersburg to arrange, is the
"denominations of the coupons. We do
not wish a higher coupon than $2000,
as high denominations are incon
venient V) negotiate.
"The readiness with which the full
amount has been subscribed shows the
solidity of Russian credit. This is
in contrast to the rate Japan pays.
She realizes about 93 for a 6 per.
cent bond after pledging customs,
where Russia realizes more than 98 on
a 5 per cent bond.** : â¢
LONDON, May 5.â A dispatch to the
Central News from St. Petersburg says
a rumor is current there that a second
battle has been fought at Kullencheng,
in which the Russian loss was 7000 men
and the Japanese loss 10,000 men, and
resulted in the Japanese being driven
back in disorder. The dispatch adds
that no confirmation of this report is
obtainable.
A Tokio dispatch to the Central News
states that after the steamships had

ST. PETERSBURG, May 5.â There
are persistent rumors of a naval 1 * en
gagement between the Vladivostok and
Vice Admiral Kamlmura's squadrons,
but no confirmation of the reports had
been received up to 1 o'clock this after
noon. The Admiralty says no further
news has been received here from. Port

There are rumors here, which cannot
be traced to a responsible source, that
the Russian troops in Northwestern
Korea have swoooed down upon the
Japanese below the Yalu River, win
ning a big victory. The. story; is not
credited.
PARIS, May 5.â A dispatch to the

.ST. PETERSBURG. May 5. â The
effe'ft of the disaster to Russian arms
on the Yalu upon the Chinese is being
v^atched with keen interest and con
siderable apprehension. The Russian
Government appears to be satisfied
with the situation for the moment, and
Paul Lessar. the Russian Minister at
Peking. Is making daily reports to the
Foreign OfUce. The report received
from the Minister to-day contained
noth'ing disquieting.
- The Peking Government, according
to Russian reports, seems to be acting
in good faith and insists that it is in
tent un.on preserving neutrality. It is
turning a deaf ear to the appeals of
anti-Russian leaders, who want China
to throw in her lot with Japan, and is
doing all possible to suppress anti
foreign, agitation among the people.
Â¦Nevertheless, the Russian authori
ties regard China as a powder maga
zine. They realize the danger and the
necessity for constant pressure on the
part of the Russian Government. The
danger of an anti-foreign, movement
throughout the Chinese empire exists
not only for Russia, but for all the
powers, and Russia has at least three
times since the outbreak of the war
addressed the powers on the subject,
the last time being less than ten days
ago. The answers received uniformly
show a full appreciation of the need
of exercising a restraining influence on
Pelcing and all the powers are co
operating to this end.
RUSSIA APPEALS TO POWERS.
Â«
PORT ARTHUR. May 5.â The Jap
anese squadron is behind the Llao
shan promontory, south of Port Ar
thur, and an attack is expected.
Transports with Japanese troops on
board have arrived at Pitzwo, north
cast of Port Arthur, with the object of
making a landing;. ;
Pitzwo is situated on the east coast
of the Liaotung Peninsula and about I
seventy-five miles northeast of Port j
Arthur. It is near the narrowest part I
of the peninsula, along which passes
the railroad connecting Port Arthur
with Mukden and Harbin. Kinchou
Bay, where the Japanese transports
&if reported to have been sighted, is
on the west of the Liaotung Peninsula
and not far from Pitzwo.
It has been ascertained that twelve
fireships participated in the latest at
â¢ tempt to block the Entrance to the har
bor. The wrecks of eight of these have |
been definitely located; the positions of
two others are not yet known and the
remaining two, unable to withstand the
.terrific fire of the Russian guns, turned
back.
The average tonnage of the flreships
exceeded 20U0 tons. They were the Shi
bata, Kokura. Asagao, Mikawa, Fudo
pan. Yedo, Nagato, Otaru, Sagami,
Aikoku, Totomi and Fakusa. the latter
of 3000 tons.
The Japanese displayed desperate
courage in the attack. The fireships, as
tljfcy approached, were divided into three
groups, all heading 1 straight for the
entrance of the harbor. While still far
froru the shore they ran on to the Rus
EÂ»an mines and they were under a mur
derous fire from the Russian batteries.
Several torpedo-boats followed the fire
ships to pick up the crews of the latter.
- SVhen the first ship foundered the
crew clambered up the mast, cheering
for the Emperor of Japan as they went
"derail. From the masthead of the sec
ond vessel, as she began to Fink, her
fcrew waved lanterns to indicate her
course to those astern. ThAr small
boats, though soon riddled, did not raise
the .white flag.
A Japanese sailor who came ashore
at Electric Hill when summoned to
â¢surrender pprang forward with a re
;volver in his hand and died flerhtinc.
'Another Japanese Bailor, who was
pulled out OX the water, tried to throt
tle himself with his necktie. One of
the Russian rowboats which ao
prbached a sinking ship for the purpose
of saving her crew was met by small
a"rms fire.
I The Russian sailors showed every
consideration for the captured Jap
anese, wrapping them up in their own
coats and carrying them ashore.
One of the rescued Japanese officers
committed suicide by disembowelinK
himself, declaring he would rather die
than g-o home in disgrace.
This dispatch, thouph written when
Jthe Russians had had opportunity to
ascertain the location of eight of the
ten sunken fireships, makes no mention,
it will be noticed, of the blocking of
"the harbor entrance, as reported in
Tokio.. The first dispatch from Port
Arthur expressly stated that the attack
, failed to close the channel.

Kuropatkin 3Iu|t Face Large
Forces in Front and. in
the Rear*
In connection with . the obstinate
stand %niade by the -Russians at the
Yalu, against instructions and in the
face of an overwhelming superiority of
men and. guns, an interesting bit of
the history of what occurred durine the
maneuvers near St. Petersburg last
summer Is being recounted, which il
lustrates this trait in .General Zassu
litch's character. He commanded an
infantry division and insisted upon
storming heights commanded by ar
tillery and in the face of a flre which
theoretically wiped out his command.
The judges were so disgusted that they
rewarded the blunder with a zero mark
against the general's name.
Under the old rules and traditions
of the Russian army the second arid
third batteries of the Third Artillery
Brigade and the third battery of the
Third Brigade, which lost their jruns
at the. battle o{ Kulienchener. would
have been stricken 'from the army list
forever. The names of batteries losing
It is understood here that General
Zassulitch has already been relieved of
his command for disobedience of orders
and that his action is under Investiga
tion.
Private reports are to the effect that
the fighting blood of the Russian sol
diers is up and that they are thirsting
for an opportunity to avenge the
slaughter on the Yalu; but, although
the commander-in-chief is greatly cha
grined at the miscarriage of his plans
on the Yalu, there Is no idea here that
he will act rashly on that account. His
decision as to the extent of the opposi
tion he will make at Fengwangcheng
depends upon the location and success
of Japanese landings in Manchuria.
Descents or attempted landings are
now momentarily expected near New
chwang and the head of Korea Bay.
Occupying an interior line and pursu
ing the tactics of Napoleon, Kuropat
kin's problem will be to prevent a junc
ture of the enemy's forces. It. Is neces
sary for him to await the development
of the Japanese plans and . ascertain
the direction and strength o'f the other
column, and whence it will come, be
fore deciding how to fight his adver
sary in detail.
TOGO MENACES PORT ARTHUR.
It is believed here that the Japanese
plans for concerted "action have been
embarrassed by their failure to block
the entrance to Port Arthur on Tues
day and a repetition of the attack upon
the Russian Gibraltar is momentarily
expected.
Vice Admiral Togo's fleet was sighted
off Port Arthur last night, and. Indeed,
unconfirmed rumors say he attacked at
daylight this morning and that fighting
is now in progress there. At least the
cutting off of Port Arthur, if not the
fate of the fortress, depends, in the
opinion of the general staff, upon Gen
eral Kuropatkin's preventing a Junc
ture of the Japanese forces.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 5.â General
Kuropatkin has gone to the front from
Liaoyang to inspect the situation per
sonally. Troops are being hurried for
ward from the Liaoyang and Mukden
line to a position near Fengwangcheng.
All of the Russian wounded have been
eent back toward Liaoyang, in order
not to incumber the operations of the
Russian army. "It appears evident that
General Kuropatkin is .preparing to
give battle to General Kuroki's army,
if circumstances warrant.
The'Novoe Vremya's expert says the
report of Major General Kashtalinsky
proves clearly that the Russians shouM
have withdrawn during the night of
April 30, and adds:
"Kashtalinsky foredoomed them to
destruction/ It was a miracle of hero-
Ism and fortitude that they escaped
after staying and Inflicting such tre
mendous, losses upon the enemy.
"General Kuroki probably has eight
divisions available for Â«an immediate
advance. This force will be joined by
General Oku's army when the latter is
landed. , The Japanese have every rea
son to follow the southern road, where
they will have the advantage of the
co-operation* of their ships. The roads
are less difficult and mountainous
through the Fengwangcheng: district,
but the Japanese must dispose of the
Russian force at Fengwangcheng be
fore they can cut oft Liaotung."
A high officer of the staff, who does
not believe the Japanese will make an
immediate advance in Manchuria, said:
"They are too careful to commit
such a blunder as to expose their flank
to the Russians stationed at Feng
wangcheng. I think they will fortify
their position at the Yalu and may
land troops at Takushan and hold the
seashore, but in no wise will they ad
vance across to Liaotung, where they
might be taken on either flank by Gen
eral Kuropatkin from Liaoyang and
General Stoessel from the south."

anese paid too dearly for. their victory.

Leading Democrats of the interior are
confident that the Santa Cruz conven
tion will not instruct the California
delegation to the national convention
to support Hearst. It is said that a
majority of the delegates will vigorous
ly oppose iron-clad instructions. Reso
lutions commending Hearst in a gen
eral sense and reciting the fact that he
was born in California may be adopted
without formidable opposition. The sen
timent, however, against binding the
delegation to the support of any candi
date seems to prevail in the Democratic
camp. There is a general idea that the
delegates to the St. Louis convention
should be left free to support Parker,
Olney, Gorman, Hearst or any other
candidate who may develop winning
strength. Ht is within the range of
probability that some kind of a reso
lution in general praise of Hearst may
prove acceptable to M. F. Tafpey and
B. D. Murphy.
It is common gossip that many of
the preeminent Democrats. of the State
will attend the Santa Cruz convention.

The natives are most courteoua to tourists,

OL.YMPIA, Wash., May 5.â The selec
tion of a delegation to the Democratic
National Convention, seven of whom
are considered favorable to the candi
dacy of William R. Hearst for Pres
ident and three opposed, and the adop
tion of resolutions dealing with na
tional issues and containing an In
dorsement of ex-Senator Turner of
Spokane for Vice President, consti
tuted the work of the Democratic State
Convention, which cloeed its labors at
7 o'clock this evening.
Last night and up to the hour of
permanent organization It appeared
that a contest over the indorsements
to be contained in the instructions must
be carried out on the floor of the con
vention, but when the test came cooler
counsels prevailed and a compromise
programme was carried through with
little friction.
The Hearst men, who had been striv
ing for a definite instruction for their
candidate, contented themselves with
a majority of the delegation to St.
Louis absolutely unpledged as to Pres
ident, but tied to a unit rule, while
the Turner men accepted a strong in
dorsement of Turner for Vice Pres
ident without any definite tie-up to any
Presidential candidate.
Tlie resolutions indorse the national
platforms of 1S96 and 1900 and insist
on the nomination of candidates In
sympathy therewith. The national
administration is censured for alleged
extravagance and corruption in Us de
partments and for embroilment in Old
World controversies. The resolutions
demand a cessation of "militarism, im
perialism and coloniglism," and call for
an income tax and inheritance tax, de
struction c-f trusts and removal of un
necessary tariff walls. They express
confidence in the capacity, fidelity and
integrity of W. J. Bryan.
The delegation elected to the National
Convention follows: R. W. Starr. W. J.

.WASHINGTON. May 5.â It was an
nounced at the White House to-day
that- former Governor Frank S. Black
of Netv York would make the principal
speech nominating President Rooseveit
at the Chicago convention. He wUl be
followed by several delegates with sec
onding speeches, one of â¢whom will be
IJarcy St'.iwell Edwards, the well
known author and writer of Macon.
Ga. :\t this time, however, it has not
bÂ«en determined definitely who will,
deliver the other speeches.
Concrete results of the series of po
litical conferences held at the White
House during the past, week have not
keen reached on several of the impor
tant topics under discussion. It was
vaid to-day by authority that thes<*
conferences are only the beginning of
many that will be held from time to
time before the Chicago convention.
The expectation is that a decision re
garding the chairmanship of the Re
publican National Committee will be
reached before the convention assem
bles, but that it has not been reached
jet is asserted positively.
The President ha? adhered to his de
termination, announced months ago,
rot to permit himself to be drawn into
"any contest that might arise over the
roraination of a candidate for the Vice
Presidency. Naturally he is interested
Irs the matter, but he believes that It
cugnt to be determined by the party
leaders in the convention, without sug
pestlon from him.
The revival of the report that Cor
nelius-N. B'.iss of New York is to be
chairman of the Republican National
Committee is based entirely upon-the
fact that there is now a possibility of.
Bliss assuming the position. The choice
apparently lies between Bliss, Gov
rrnor Franklin Murphy of New Jersey
sn<3 Secretary of the Treasury Shaw*.

refusing to accept their pastors was in
significant.
The world-wide scope of the work of
the church as represented in the body
was indicated by the brief review of
the administration of Bishop Moore In
China, Korea and Japan; of Bishop
Vincent in Europe; of Bishops Joyce
and Warren In South America: of
Bishops Thoburn, Warne and Warren
in India,- Bishop Hartzell in Africa, and
of other Bishops who have visited Mex
ico and other countries where missions
are maintained.
Three features of the last quadren
nlum were emphasized as standing out
prominentlyâ the twentieth century
thank offering movement, , which
brought $20,000,000 Into the treasury of
the church for the work of education,
philanthropy and debt paying; the
open-door emergency missionary re
vival, which has inspired the church
with new generosity, and the blcenten- ;
nlal observances, which all over the
English-speaking world commemo- :
rated the two hundredth anniversary
of John Wesley's birth.
The American University at Wash
ington was strongly commended, as
well as the woman's college of Balti- i
more, which indirectly suffered severe
losses during the recent fire in that
city.
The relations between the Methodist
Episcopal church and. the Methodist
Episcopal church South were declared ;
to be growlngly fraternal and intimate.
A common hymnal, a common cate- j
chlsm and a uniform" order of service j
are almost ready for publication, and
these will draw the bodies still more,
closely together. The suggestion was i
made that some mutual . arrangement
should be made whereby transfer of
ministers and members from Â¦ one of
these denominations to the other should
be expedited and made easy.
FOREIGN FIELD SUPERVISION.
The question of supervising foreign
mission fieldsâ whether . by occasional
visits or general superintendents from
this country; by the residence of one
of them Irf a mission field for a period
of four years at a time; or by the per
manent supervision of a missionary
Bishop, whose episcopal services shall
be confined to that particular field â
was urged upon the conference as one
of, the most important questions to be
considered. The time limit in the pas
torate was referred to as one of the
matters which would claim attention,
but no judgment was expressed for or
against the proposition urged in some
quarters for its restoration. It may be
recalled that the time limit of a Meth
odist pastor was five years until the
General Conference of 1900 removed it
entirely, so that under the present law
a pastor is appointed for a year, with
indefinite privilege of reappolntment." It
is understood that some of the Bishops
desire a limit of some kind to be re
stored, but the fact that no proposal to
reirstate it was made Is taken as evi
dence that the Bishops as a body are
not ready to recommend Its restoration.
Warnings were given against the
current evils of the time, political cor
ruption, the liquor traffic, the tyranny
of trades unionism, the greed of un
scrupulous employers,, lynching, the
negro question and Mormonism. A rec
ommendation , was made that a new
chapter on popular amusements be
added to the discipline, admonishing
Methodists to- guard, their spiritual life
Â¦ and to avoid such amusements as have
a dangerous or demoralizing tendency.
The chapter is: J^^Jed to take - the
place of the pres*^ paragraph number
248, which occasu^id" much discussion
, at the General Conference at Chicago
four years ago. The address as a whole
made a deep impression and > was re
r*ivfd at the end with hearty applause.

BOSTON May 5, â A proposition to memori

The present, membership of the
church was reported as 3.031,918, an in
crease of 138,025 duringVthe four years.
The Sunday-schools include an aggre
gate of 3.124,644. It was reported the
Bishops had made appointments of
ministers to their work at the rate of
about 15,000 each year, and that the
Mrs. M. E. Roberts of Lincoln, Nebr.,
was the first woman to raise her voice
in the proceedings of the Methodist
General Conference. She claimed the
attention of the chair only to offer a
motion that Mrs. General Clinton B.
Fisk and Mrs. George E. Robinson,
women prominent in the missionary
work of the church, be invited to seats
on the stage. Mrs. Roberts was heart
ily applauded by the delegates and her
motion prevailed without dissent.
The reading of the quadrennial ad
dress of the Bishops of the Methodist
Episcopal church to the General Con
ference was the feature of the day's
session. This address is always a
composite document, the joint work of
the entire board, but it is shaped and
outlined and put together by the gen
eral superintendents in succession. In
the order of their seniority, each quad
rennlum. This work this year fell to
the lot of Bishop Cyrus D. Foss of
Philadelphia, who read the address.
Its reading lasted two hours.
It elaborately reviewed the statistical
lecords for the past four years and set
before the conference many of the cur
rent problems which the church is fac
ing. It â¢ opened with an appreciative
allusion to the beauty, fruitfulness
and promise of the Pacific Coast, in
contrast with Daniel Webster's decla
ration sixty years ago that he would
not vote onn dollar to afford mail fa
cilities to bring the far away, worthless
Northwest one day nearer to" Boston. ',
Tributes were paid to the worth and

sufficiently digest the situation as re
gards the question of more ' Bishops
between now and May 10, he could not
appreciate that man's mental condition.
He moved to lay the matter on the ta
ble, which was promptly done.
The speaker declared that he was as
willing as any member of the confer
ence to extend the right hand of fel
lowship to the colored delegates, but
he believed that the race question had
been brought before the General Con
ferences entirely too often and he hoped
that the present conference would see
an end to this agitation. He was will
ing, he said, to see any man elevated
to episcopal honors, regardless of color,
when that man should attain to such
worth and distinction as would war
rant this high recognition.
A resolution was offered by the Rev.
Horace Jacobs of the Central Pennsyl
vania Conference to request the pub
lishers of the Daily Christian Advo
cate, the official organ oi the confer
ence, to withdraw from its advertising
columns all reference to Sunday news
papers. One of the publishers of . the
Advocate gave assurance to the con
ference that If the resolution should be
withdrawn there would be no further
cause for complaint on that score,
which was taken to mean that Sunday
newspaper advertisements would not be
accepted hereafter. . ... ... ...
A motion by a delegate to- have the
committee on episcopacy report on May
10 as to the number of Bishops to be
elected brought out the first speech
from Dr. J. M. Buckley of New York.
Dr. Buckley is a great favorite - with
the delegates, and whenever he rises to
speak he is given hearty applause and
listened to with" the greatest attention.

QUESTION OF RACE.
Charles P. McClelland bf New York,
lay delegate, spoke in opposition to Dr.
EUiott'B resolution. Mr. McClelland
said he was very sorry that this reso
lution was offered at this time; that
If the church had reached a crisis in
its relations with the colored
It was brought about by just "such
resolutions as this.
The conference had its first taste of
debate at this afternoon's session, and
if it may be considered as forecasting
what is to follow the delegates will
hear some very interesting discussion
between the oratorical leaders before
the conference closes.
. Dr. George Elliott- of Detroit, Mich.,
presented a memorial to the effect that
the committee on episcopacy consider
the advisability of the election of a col
ored Bishop. In speaking to the mo
tion he said that he believed the Meth
odist Episcopal church had reached a
crisis in its relations with the colored
race. He continued:
If we are to hold the 300,000 colored mem
bership we now hare we ought to give them
Â¦ome sort of leadership which they understand
and trust and which underÂ«tands them. If at
any time In the future our colored people should
go from us to set up housekeeping by them
eelveÂ«, which God forbid, they could so with
some assurance and confidence if they had in
telligent and trustworthy leaders.
ORATORY IN PROSPECT.
The various committees, wherein will
occur most of the contests on many
Important subjects to be brought be
fore the conference, performed no work
to-day. Some of them got together
during the early morning hours and
elected their respective chairmen and
secretaries, but as there was no busi
ness before them adjournments were
taken until to-morrow. Beginning to
morrow the General Conference will
hold sessions only in the morning, thus
allowing the delegates to give their at
tention during the afternoon to com
mittee work.

Sheriff Quinn of Butte. who came
here to take charge of the prisoner, and
the local police are now of the opin

that not only had Lennox not been cap

IIERMOSILLO, Mexico, May 5. â
Governor Tsabel of Sonora and a de
tachment of the Eleventh Battalion
eruarding fifty Yaqul prisoners have
Just returned from the front with the
Crst complete reports of the taking
of - the town of Rayon and the eubse
<jÂ«ex;t overwhelming defeat of the In
dians at Agua Escondido and advan
tageous points In the San Horcasitas
which they had fortified.
The Indians had fled to Apia Es
. condido. their last resort, and there
renewed negotiations for surrender.
One of their leaders met General
â¢Torres at the Gava Linda hacienda,
but the Indians insisted upon the re
scinding of the deportation order and
General Torres refused to consider
their terms.
When all efforts to effect a surren
der without a battle had been con
cluded Torres and Ysabel at the head
of the cavalry, infantry and rurales
advanced upon the Yaqui stronghold.
The Mexican troops charged up the
hill in the face of the Yaqui fire and
the Indians were surrounded in their
own naturnl fortification, which they
considered impregnable. Torres could
not maintain his advantage, however,
anfl all but fifty of the Yaquls es
caped up a canyon.
The Indians left a dozen dead and
many dying on the field. Governor
Ysabel estimates that the wounded
prisoners left behind number two
â¢ score. The Eleventh Battalion lost
three killed and the Fifth Cavalry had
'one trooper shot, while many wound
ed "are being brought into Hermosillo.
The defeat of the Yaquis was com
plete and It is not thought that they

Secretary Taft will probably effect
this wholesale promotion through a
blanket order affecting all the officers

Is necessary, however, as it is expressly
stipulated that the service in the Civil
War must have been creditable.
The War Department is not much in
clined to regard ordinary breaches of
discipline not serious enough to merit
court-martial as detracting . from a
creditable record.

of wholesale legislation by the last
Congress. Judge Advocate General Da

tary Taft that those officers below the
rank of brigadier general who served
creditably in the Civil War and have
since been retired may at once be given
the rank and pay of the next higher
grade, as provided by the army appro

Instead of having places for. mere ealarlad

So popular has become the pure
food and Industrial exposition now be
ing held at the Mechanics' Pavilion
under the auspices of the Retail Gro
cers' Association that the advisability
of prolonging the fair is under con
sideration. Applications have been
received from a score of the largest
manufacturers of staples and special
ties on the coast- for floor space and
from all indications the pure food ex
position will be one of the perma
nent annual institutions of this city.
.It has been the aim of those in
charge to make the exposition a rep
resentative. Place of exhibition for all
products worthy the 'name of "pure
foods", and it can be safely said that
all goods displayed are free of adul
teration. From an artistic point there
is nothing to be desired. The booths
have been tastefully decorated and in
many cases there has been a lavish
expenditure of money for attractive
electrical illumination.
The local turn vereins were out in
force last night and the Pavilion was
crowded to -the doors. This evening
the athletes from the Olympic Club
will rule supreme. Wrestling bouts
between the cleverest amateurs of the
coast have been arranged and the
members of the Lincoln Athletic Club
have signified their willingness to pro
vide several "mills" by pugilists of re
pute. . -. : Â¦

Place of Convention for 1905.
The last day's session was opened
promptly on time, with .the expecta
tion of getting through early. Delegate
Ashley placed Cincinnati in nomination
for the next annual convention.
Delegate Schultz ' of Missouri placed
Niagara Falls in nomination, and stated
the assembling there of the national
association would solidify the order
and redound in greater results.
Assistant Secretary Weis of Roches
ter. N. Y.. Delegate Westerfleld of Chi
cago and Delegate Sullivan of Missouri
backed the movement for Niagara.
-â¢With cheers, shouts and heartfull
cleaning the eeventh annual conven
tion of the National Association of Re
tall Grocers wound up its proceedings
â¢It e grand banquet In the art hall of
Mechanics' Pavilion last night and the
tiext fare-ye-wells and business ar
rangements will be made In Cincinnati,
which -was selected as the coming place
cj meeting.
Hilarity, with all ita accompanying
features, ruled the proceedings of the
banquet after the menu had been thor
oughly enjoyed and the waiters had
served every edible thereon contained.
Thomas H. Corcoran, who had taken
care cf the arrangements and had
provided for the best time the Retail
Grocers' National Association has ever
had. introduced the toastmaster as Jo
seph A. Ptulz of San Francisco. Guests
"were requested to be seated and apply
The .knife and fork to the good things
to be served. They did so, and many
an Individual filled its system with ths
Viands prepared before Toastmaster
Ftultz called for the first response to
toasts.
The menu was a work of art. Three
Califorria poppies, with theliÂ» full yel
lejw. against a blue background and a
polden surtset, was the first greeting to
the eye and on the first page of the
list of good things appeared everything
ihe palate might appreciate.,
Seated next to Toastmaster Stulz on
the right was Mayor Schmitz and next
to him was President Farlinger and
Joining him was Secretary Fred Mason.
To the left of Mr. Stulz ex-President
Charles R. Lott and wife were seated.
- . T. H. Corcoran of San Francisco in
troduced Joseph A. Stulz as toastmas
t*>>* n{ th*> evening.
â¢ When Toastmaster Stulz rapped for
to call for the first toast, fully
â¬00 banqueters lifted their heads and
vcre silent. Even the music, which
had from time to time during the ban
eject rendered inspiring airs, held aloof
and waited.
APPROPRIATE TOASTS.
"Hell Gate and Golden Gate each has
!ts delegate" is the way Joseph A.
Stulz opened the talk of the evening.
Mayor Schmitz was called upon to re
ppond to the toast. "Our Country and
the President." Before Mayor Schmitz
could respond some enthusiast in the
hall called for three cheers and . they
Â¦were given with a roar.
Speaking on the subject at issue, he
Faid in part that the people of the
Â¦United States could do their duty at
all times. That resulted from the
pioneer spirit. Leading up to the pres
ent conditions, he spoke of the present
administration of the United States
and when he mentioned Theodore
?Roosevelt the attendants at the ban
quet went wild and applauded until he
had to hold his hand up for silence.
He continued with the famous quota
lion, ."Our country, right or wrong.
our country." He closed with the sen
timent. "Our country, my country â the
TJsited States."
Ex-President Lott could not be heard
for several minutes owing to the ap
jf.ause .following his introduction, but
when order was obtained he was heard.
He 'lid not wonder that California had
increased in population if people who
preceded the grocers were treated as
the Grocers* Association had been.
. John A: Green of Ohio responded to
the toast of "The Next Convention
City" and stated how the result had
been socured and how Cincinnati would
respond. ;-Â«.-.,
William Cluflf was called upon to
spetfk on "What Has -Been" and he
â¢stated he had spent fifteen years be
hind a grocer's counter, but now fa?
believed the annihilator of the system
was on hand.
' Andrea Ebarboro hoped that what he
â¢would say would be beneficial to Cali
fornia, but there was one thing which
should be told to your clerks â that a
.f>oy who started as a clerk had reached
at least half-way the position to which
th#> toastmasler had called him. "the
Napoleon of finance."
FRED MASON' TALKS.
Fred Mason tried to speak as he was
Introduced, but the band started "He's
a Jolly Good Fellow." and that started
Jthe fun. Story after story followed,
and the ultimate result was hilarity.
The band played "Dixie" and the
banqueters went wild, only to be set
tled with the tune of "Baby Mine,"
which was followed by "John Brown's
Body." In fact, the "late lamented un
pleasantness" was a national harmony,
but it was only, brought about by hard
lungs." t
William Gray of New York waa cut
loose and told many funny stories that
captured the audience.
All the popular songs of the day were
With the entire audience standing on
their feet and singing the air of
"America," newly elected President
Farlinger was introduced. He paid a
tribute to the ladies. of California and
to the wines of the State.
Er-Governor Fancher of North Da
kota was the last speaker, and he took
the subject of theories and tried to ap
ply them to California. He could not
understand why California should sit
by as it does when there' are such op
portunities -ahead. *,

retail grocers wound up the banquet*

homes for sleep and preparation for the
excursion to San Jose this morning.
spilled during the interim, and the ban
queters took up the tune in singing
while the band played.
F. M. Spain of Washington was down
on the toast llBt for "The Far West."
He gave the response as only an or
ganizer can. Interruptions cut no fig
ure with him, for he had been there
before and knew what banquets were.
Applause greeted his remarks.

sembling, but as soon as the delegates
were called together H. Fischer of
Omaha read a paper on "The Laws
Affecting the Interests. We Represent."
He contended that the business men
must enter politics to secure the laws
they need. Pure food laws are of great
importance to the grocer. Trading
stamps should be prohibited and goods
should be sold on their merits.
The report of the committee on reso
lutions was read by Galllgan of Colo
rado. One resolution provided for a
change in the method of selecting the
next place of meeting. The resolu
tion was laid on the table. A resolu
tion to prevent or discourage the sys
tem of giving prizes for goods was
adopted. The convention went on rec
ord as opposed to all "short measure"
goods offered the trade. The thanks
of the delegates were ordered expressed
for the courtesies extended by the peo
ple of California. Mutual fire insur
ance was recommended as the proper
method of protection for retail gro
cers after considerable discussion.
PRESENT FOR LOTT.
Secretary Fred Mason was re-elected
by acclamation. That was a foregone
conclusion. He will retain his head
quarters in St. Paul.
Treasurer F. M. Newland of TJppeka,
Kans., was re-elected.
"William Gray of New York was elect
ed a member of the executive board to
succeed Scherer, resigned. W. J. Galli
gan of Colorado was elected on the
executive board for the regular term
of three years. " .
Nominations were called for presi
dent. It was proposed that Charles R.
Lott, the Dresent officer, be re-elected
by acclamation. Lott highly appre
ciated the honor but insisted upon de
clining the position. With regret the
convention accepted the inevitable, and
A. W. Farlinger of Atlanta, Ga., vice
president, was elected president by ac
clamation, Secretary Fred Mason cast
ing the official ballot.
Joseph A. Stulz of San Francisco
was placed in nomination for vice pres
ident. Although he wanted to decline,
the convention would not permit such
a thing and he will serve.
Delegate Scherer took exception to
some statements made which left the
impression that by going to Niagara
Falls a debt of gratitude would be paid.
He indorsed Cincinnati.
Cincinnati was selected as the next
place of meeting by a vote of 78 to 74
for Niagara Falls. The vote for Cin
cinnati was made unanimous amid
great hilarity.
Delegate Scherer resigned as a mem
ber of the board of directors owing to
the fact that he had retired from the
grocery business. After prolonged de
bate the resignation was accepted.

Mrs. Dasha was called to-night and
stayed for some time at her husband's
bedside.
Dasha and Dempsey were taken to
the County Jail last Friday to serve
sentences of one year each. From the
moment almost of his arrival Dasha
was under the attention of the jail phy
sician. Last December, while he was
awaiting trial, Dasha suffered a seri
ous attack of pneumonia. The effect
on his heart was such as to leave that
organ in a weakened condition. During
his six days in the Alameda County Jail
Dasha has slept hardly an hour. He
grew worse so rapidly to-day that Dr.
Tisdale notified Sheriff Bishop that the
patient had only a short time to live.
In view of the circumstances United
States Marshal Shine was informed and
that officer granted permission for
Dasha's removal to the hospital. The
patient was so weak that he was taken
in a carriage from the Jail to the hos
pital, which is only two blocks from the
jail.
"We did not want Dasha to die in
Jail," said Jailer Percy White to-night,
"and for that reason asked Marshal
Shine for permission to send the man
to the hospital. Dr. Tisdale declares
that Dasha has barely two days to
live."
William F. Dasha, the former deputy
sheriff and Jailer at the County Jail In
San Francisco who with T. J. Dempsey
was convicted of conspiracy In connec
tion with Chinese substitution cases,
was removed this afternoon from the
Alameda County Jail to the Receiving
Hospital in a critical condition from
heart disease. Dr. C. L. Tisdale. the
jail physician, said Dasha would not
live forty-eight hours, so seriously had
the prisoner been stricken.

But Hadlen's suspicions were aroused
when he saw Adams" with his wife. Mrs.
Hadlen Intervened, but could accom
plish nothing.
"It was all a mistake." said the Had
lens to-day at the home of the bride's
mother, where they are staying. "It
was all due to the old-time Jealousy.
We are at peace with Mr. Adams now
and do not expect any more trouble."

len. a wealthy Berkeleyan. and Adams
was formerly a car conductor.
Upon : seeing his former rival in the
company of his bride of four months,
Frederick Hadlen of the firm of Hadlen
& Sons, grocers in West Berkeley, im
mediately pounced upon his wife's es
cort with the purpose of giving the of
fender a drubbing. But the rival, who
goes by the name of George A. Adams,
is a man of brawn, and he was not
willing to let a chance like that go by,
so he contributed fuel to the feud by
sending home a few blows himself. The
upshot of it all was that the belliger
ents were arrested for disturbing the
peace and brought before the Dogberry
of Emeryville Township, who promptly
released them on $15 bail. /
As the story goes, Hadlen had prear
ranged to meet his wife after the pic
nic at Shell Mound last Sunday. Upon
arriving at the grounds he espied his
wife coming down a path with Adams.
Hadlen and Adams were formerly riv
als for the hand of Mrs. Hadlen. who
was a Miss Hoffman. If was a bitter
matrimonial race, which Hadlen finally
\von, the wedding having been cele
brated four months ago. Meantime
Adams married another girl, and it
seemed all smooth sailing for the young

all blend in a brilliant picture that may
be seen nowhere else in all California's
beautiful length.

able to locate him and the summons
to appear in court and answer the
charges of malfeasance In office, made

doe* not believe that V.'eJdler has left

there that he is evading service of the

for? Prosecuting Attorney Abe Leach
to-day and asked for a warrant for
"VVeidler's arrfft, claiming that the offl

the extent of $152 50. Leach refused to
irsue the warrant, as We'.dler siill has
?ome time before hi? tardiness In pay
ing over the money would legally
amount to a defalcation.
According to Turn Suden's statement
Weidler collected the money through
an attachment and has failed to mak^
return. Turn Suden made a demand
ujvjp the surety company and was to'.d
thnt he must swear out a complaint
ngainst WeSdler first and prove in a

made March -4 and according to law
Weidler has sixty dayp In which to

By Instructions from the last State con
vention oJ fruit irr6wers this committee was
directed to devise and put into operation plans
for the co-operative organization of the dried
fruit interests of the .Pacific Coast, Including
nuts and raisins. After earnest deliberation
this committee unanimously recommended a
general plan of work which has been very
generally published.
To promote the work of organization upon
these or other lines this committee deems it
advisable that a convention of fruit growers
be called to confer concerning the ! condition!
which now menses, this industry and if pos
sible to agree upon eome line of action which
shall gradually place it upon a reasonably
profitable basis year by year.
It is believed that the present situation of
this great industry is a most critical ons,
not because the world does not want our pro
ducts, but because our fruit growers are defy
ing all rules that are now essential to suc
cess In the marketing of any product â leaving
it to market itself and each one to compete
with all others In the selling market.
As this industry is in a large measure the
basis of the commercial prosperity of . many
important cities of our State we appeal to
the leaders In all lines of trade â bankers,
merchants and manufacturers â to seriously
consider this matter and give this movement
the advantage of their counsel and influence,
to the end that the present chaotic methods
of marketing may be replaced by a safe.
economic and thorouehly businesslike organ
ization to promote the marketing of these lines
of coast products.
Therefore, to advance this work a confer
ence is hereby called of all who ara Interested
in It. to meet at San Jose. Mav 10, at 1:30
p. m. AH associations of growers are especial
ly Invited to be represented by their full
boards of director?, so far as possible, and

Special Dispatch to The Call,
After the calling of the roll of dele
gates, which showed that several more
delegates had arrived since yesterday,
and other preliminary business had
been attended to a telegram from the
Grand Court of Oregon was received
and read, as was also one from the
Grand Court at Tucson and the court
: at Willows. A message was also re
! ceived from H. L. Simon of San Fran
j Cisco, who was unable to attend the
! session on account of a recent accident.
An invitation to hold the next Grand
Court at Watsonville was received in a
| telegram from the Mayor and Board of
Aldermen of that city and also from
Court Pajaro of that city, but as the
matter of where to hold the next ses
sion has. not yet come up for considera
tion the invitations were not discussed.
The proposition of the executive com
mittee procuring suitable headquarters
also came up again and a resolution
was adopted recommending that such
be done. The question of fixing the
j bond of the great secretary and treas
urer for the coming year also came be
| fore the court, and after a heated dis
i cusslon it was decided to leave the
! bond Just as it was fixed at the preced
j ing session of the Grand Court. The
'election of officers will "occur to-mor
row. The report of the committees on
appeals and grievances and laws and
amendments were presented and the
report or the committee on the state of
the order was under consideration at
the time of adjournment.
In the headquarters for the ladies
who came with their husbands and
friends to the Grand Court there is a
feature of the meeting here this week
that has been overlooked. The dining
room of the Hotel Hanford is dressed
in beauty and furnished so as to make
a complete rest room and social parlor
for all those who call to enjoy the
hours. Wednesday night the ladies en
tertained a large number of ladies and
gentlenysn in a very excellent manner
and added greatly to the efforts of the
men of Hanford who have their pro
grammes eisewhere.

Regal Output Doubled
/ T V WO great additions have been built on to the Regal factory at Whitmstti,"
Mass., increasing the capacity of the Regal. plant 100 percent
With fifteen new Regal stores opening this Spring, and more coming,"
and the rest of the seventy-two Regal stores doing double business, â this
increase of factory capacity became necessary in order to take care of demands already existing.,-
It's aU a part* of the original Regal programâ to manufacture the very best shoes that the very best leather
and the highest grade of skilled workmanship could produce; to sell them direct to the wearer â instead of through
leather-dealers, wholesalers and retailersâ at the wholesale price ; and to probe ebery single claim Ive make.
We have probed that " Tannery to Wearer " is more than a familiar sentence â a short-cut system that
enables us to sell you direct, .at $3.50, the equal of any shoe sold anywhere at any price. We have probed by the
well-known" Valvic -Test" in Regal windows that bur Valvic Calfskin is exactly what we claim it to be â porous
but waterproofâ clean, light, cool and comfortable. We have probed that only good old-fashioned oak-tanned
leather is used in Regal soles by the "Window of the Sole "-^a removable label on every Regal shoe that discloses
a section of clean, close-fibred, unblackened, oak-tanned leather. We have probed by publicly dissecting thousands
of shoes with the famous Regal buzz-saw that Regal vamps are whole, not patched at the toe, that Regal heel-
stiffenings, toe-boxes and inner soles are solid sole leather, and that every last bit of Regal material is the best that
can be put into shoes.

material and first-Kdass workmanship. v .

A Hint to, the Mayor.
Teachers in the public schools of Oakland have reason
to believe that a little agitation will win for them the
concession of 116 reduction in salary because of forced
absence frftm duty due to illness. In urging their re
quest it will be eminently wise for the Oakland peda

merchantable specimen in the whole lot. Localities that

The director of the municipal observ
atories of Paris give's an interesting
scientific explanation of the hoar frosts
of spring, and one that again vindi
cates the soundness of observation em
bodied in proverbial sayings. In all
countries of the world the "red" or
April moon has been considered from
time immemorial dangerous for vege
tation, and the fact, though crudely
expressed, is fully confirmed by modern
science.' During April radiation of heat
from the earth at night is considerable,
while absorption of heat from the sun
during the day is still slight. "At the
same time, the low temperature clears
the air of vapors, with the result that
the moon shines more brilliantly, and
the combined result is to produce those
sharp falls in temperature that cause
the hoar frosts dreaded by farmer and
agriculturist.â London Globe.

After years of costly experiment the Federal courts
seem to have found a way to keep out of this country
the horde of Chinese coolies that have Jbcen forcing the
barriers of exclusion under the thin disguise of "native

of criminal proceedings against the white allies of these
Mongols has not. been used.
A gentleman whose sense of the religious proprieties
was outraged a few days since smote a lady friend on
the head with a heavy chair because she insisted upon
diverting herself in a game of cards on the day dedi

of the strenuous gentleman, the most conservative must
question his method. He should be placed in an institu
tion where the enforcement of Sabbath calm is like that
of every other day, a mere matter of discipline and
routine.

DAVY JONES' LOCKER â A. O. S..
Oakland. Cal. It is a common thing
for sailors to say of a person who is
dead that he has gOne to "Davy Jones'
locker." Smolett, in "Perigrene
Pickle," says: "Davy Jones, according
to the mythology of sailors, is the
fiend that presides over all the evil
spirits of the deep." a locker, in
sailors' phraseology, is something that
locks up or keeps any" 'ig safe. Hence

PEBBLE â A. M.. City. Pebble I*p
the trade name for a transparent rock
crystal or quartz used in the making 1
of lenses for eyeglasses and spectacles.
This class of crystal is obtained from
Madagascar, Switzerland and Brazil.
That from the last named country, on
account of its exceptional , hardness
and transparency, is the pre
ferred pebble for the use of opticians.
There are very few substances in na
ture that are hard enough to make a
mark on quartz pebble.
THE MADSTOXEâ W. H. S.. City.
There is considerable difference of
opinion as to the value of what is
known as the madstone. those who
have studied the matter for many
years not being unanimous as to It3
merits. It is a greenish porous stone,
said to possess the property of draw
ing the venom from the bite of a mad
dog or other animal afflicted with
hydrophobia.
When the thickness of the crust of
parafflne renders a cleansing necessary
this instrument is inserted in the pipe
at the -oil fields. The pressure of the
stream of oil drives it forward, re
volving rapidly as it hurries along,
and scrapes the channel clean.
It turns and twists and cleanses in
this manner throughout its whole
Journey and finally drops from the
piper in the midst of the vast stream
of petroleum that empties into the>re
ceiving tanks. Its edges are duller
than when it set out on its journey,
but otherwise It is in perfect condi
tion. ' It is at once shipped back to
th* oil wells, where it is sharpened and
laid away until its services are again
needed.
The device that is used to remedy
this evil is a knife about two feet in
length, with a sharp edge, constructed
like the thread of a screw; indeed, the
knife resembles a huge headless screw.
It is, of course, slightly smaller than
the pipe through which it Is to pass.
â¢ As the oil flows through these un
derground conduits some of the paraf
fine in the fluid incrusts the sides of
the pipe and proves a serious hin
drance to the free passage of the cur
rent of oil.
The long pipes that carry crude
petroleum from the oil wells to the
refineries many miles distant are
cleaned by an ingenious device, which
is described by a writer in the Omaha
Bee. Â¦ â¢";-â¢ -'-VvX 4

LLOYD'S Register of Shipping, the standard En
glish journal of marine statistics, has recently
published a review of the shipbuilding now in
progress throughout all the yards of the United King
dom. Aside from the warship construction, now at the
highest mark of activity, the Register notes some fig
ures on the building of merchant ships which should
have a strong appeal to those who hope to see the
American merchant marine flourishing again on the seas.
Lloyd's returns on the shipbuilding interests for the
last quarter ending March 31 show that, excluding war
ships, there were 398 vessels of 988,664 gross tonnage
under construction in British yards at that date. Of
these 353 were steam vessels and the remainder of the
old sailing class. For the use of the British- merchant
marine 265 of the vessels building are designed; 15
of them are under construction on orders from the
colonies and the others -are being built to fly the flag
of foreign countries. The'total tonnage of vessels build
ing in British yards is Qoioob higher than it was at the
end of the preceding quarter and comes very near the
high-water mark established in the month of September,
1901. Adding to these figures a total of 74 battleships
with a gross displacement of: 377,115 now under' course
of construction brings the whole record of shipbuilding
for the last quarter up to something well calculated to
inspire our own struggling industry with envy.
For, in contrast to that display of energy in the build
ing of ships, our -own figures are pitifully meager. In
all the yards of the United States, save those on the
Great Lakes, whence figures have not yet been obtained,
the shipbuilding for ' the. same quarter is represented
by the construction of 63 steam and sailing vessels of
over a hundred tons burden, the (total tonnage of which
is 122,935. Of these vessels 17 are building at the
Philadelphia yards, 16 at New .York, 12 at San Francisco
and other coast concerns and the remainder at the
smaller }\-irds on the 'Atlantic Coast.
Under the benign influence of subsidies the rival mer
chant marines of foreign countries have so flourished
that every year our merchants p.y . full $200,000,000
in tolls for the transportation of their goods in foreign
bottoms. With Great Britain, France and Germany the
United States supplies one-half of the total international
commerce of the world, according to the recently enun
ciated statistics of Mr. Austin, Chief c* the Bureau of
Statistics of the Department of Commerce and- Labor.
The increase in the exports from the United States since
1870 is equal to that of the United Kingdom and
Germany combined, yet our output of vessels in which
our goods might be carried to the markets of Europe
is over So per cent less than that of Great Britain, our
s:rpngcst rival in the carrying trade.
From such a position favorable legislation by Con
gress alone can raise us. No stronger argument in favor
of. the passage of the shipping bill could be found than
that made eloquent by the comparison between the fig
ures Lloyd's Register gives for British, shipbuilding
and those representing our own feeble activities in the
same industry.

Out in the Gulf of Mexico sixty-flve
miles from Key West toward the set
ting sun. rise half a dozen barren
sand bars from the exquisite turquoise
blue waters. One of these. Garden
Key. is a Government fort and coal
ing station, another Is, the Loggerhead
Key, oar last outpost toward Cuba and
Central America. Other islets are un
tenanted. save when the great sea
turtles crawl; one alone. Bird Key, is
pre-empted by the birds. It would be
hard to find a more desolate or iso
lated resion. Though the climate is
warm throughout the year, it is not
until May that the feathered hosts ar
rive from the far South at this sandy
rendezvous. In the van come the nod
dles, a few about the first of -May, and
the rest within a few days. A week
later the sooty terns pour in, and it
is said that within a week after their
arrival both kinds begin to lay. At the
time of our coming nearly all the birds
had eggs and were devoting themselves
to their family cares.
To reach the buildings from the. lit
tle landing place we had to pass
through a tract of bushes, and here
it was that I saw the first nests of the
noddies. Upon the tops, or in the forks
of the bushes each pair had built a
rather rude yet fairly substantial plat
form of sticks, only slightly hollow
ed, and upon each one sat a dark gray
bird. There was something about these
graceful little creatures that instantly
took me by storm â a case of love at
first sight. The. noddy is very, much
like a dove,. except for Its webbed iteet,
in sire, in form. In the softness of its
plumage, the expression of its large
dark eyes and Its gentle, confiding
ways. There is no wild affright as the
stranger approaches. Just a shadow
of fear is evident, but the birds sit
quietly on their nests, hoping and
trusting, and do not fly unless ap
proached almost within arm's reach.
Then they flit gently away, alighting
upon a neighboring bush until the in
truder has withdrawn, when they re
turn directly to their charge. It seem
ed remarkable to find birds so per
fectly tame. â Outing.

The Senate of this republic at the
time when Patrick Henry Hanway
was given his seat therein was a
thing of granite and ice to all new
comers. The oldsters took /no more
notice of the novice in their midst
than if he had not been, and It was
Senate tradition that a member must
hold his seat a year before he could
speak and three before he could be
listened to. If a man were cast away
on a desert island the local savage
might be relied upon to meet him on
the beach and welcome him with
either a square meal or a club. Not
so in the cold customs of the Senate.
The wanderer thrown upon its arctic
shores might starve or freeze or per
ish in what way he would; never an
oldster of them all would make a
sign. Each sat in mighty state, like
some ancient walrus on his cake of
ice, and made the new one feel his
littleness. If through Ignorance or

THE Hearst boom is like one of ;Â¦ the old-style
prairie fires that used to burn in the blue joint
grass. It would strike a wet place and . seem
to go out and the watchful farmers would go home
and go to bed. Then the wind would . rise and the
smoldering sparks would jump into dry grass and pretty
soon the fire would blaze high again, and the ; tocsin
would summon, the sleeping and' swearing farmers to
do more back firing.
Two weeks ago the Hearst boom struck a wet place
and seemed to die out. The Parker farmers in the
party went to bed and while they slept the sparks caught
in Chicago and had burned all the Parker blue joint in
Cook County. The boom then jumped the Mississippi
and soon the political welkin of Iowa was:;- lit) up by a
conflagration that destroyed all the opposition grass. .
The Democratic State Convention at Des Moines was
the liveliest seen since the days of Will Tomlinson and
Cow-and-calf Cole. The Parker forces made up in fight
what* they lacked in numbers, but the Hearst faction
Valued them, even as the Japs did the Russians. The
Hawkeye delegation went Hearst a-whooping, though
not without several painful episodes, which* members of
the peace party sincerely regret. It seems to have been
something of a race war. Against Hearst were Con
gressman Wade, Jerry Sullivan, the last candidate for
Governor, and M. F. Healy, three leading Irish Demo
crats, who have probably received copies of Mr. Barry's
newspaper, in which Mr. Hearst is despitefully treated
in prose and poetry.
The leading delegate at large is General J. B. Weaver,
a picturesque and miscellaneous figure in politics. For
merly a Republican office-holder, he became a green
backer and was that party's candidate for the Presi
dency in 18S0, receiving 306,219 votes. After that he
served a couple of terms in Congress and in 1892 was
the Populist candidate for the Presidency and* was sup
ported by Bryan, who had just acquired the Symptoms
of the fusion habit, from which he still suffers. Weaver's
stock rose. He received 1,025,187 popular votes and 23
electoral votes from five States. His campaign was
made on the stump with Mrs. Lease, the steam siren
of Populism, and was one of the novelties and wonders
Mr. Hearst will do well to keep his eye pn WVaver
and his pocket-book handy, for the general is a seduc
tive speaker, has the habit of running for office,* and
there are certain tones in his oratorical voice that
the reason of men fleeing to brutish beasts for shelter.
Weaver has all the breeding of a dark horse, and when
he whinnies nominations stop grazing and run to him.
Weaver's colleague, Judge Carr, has despaired of the
republic these many years. He has done it on the
stump and in his newspaper, and if the, country had
gone really to the dogs every time he has seen it going
By this time its bones would not be worth gnawing.
The other delegates at large are less known to fame,
though they have been, introduced to her. One of. these,
Mr. Wadsworth, was selected by the ribald opposition
to use his name as a financial suggestion, the charge
being made â¢thaj^vads of the stuff" were on hand.
One feature of. -.the convention painfully displeases
Â«s, even at this distance. The Hearst boom acts upon
oratory like a ferment in a mash tub. That is one of
its most pleasing effects. Wherever it appears' oratory
of the deepest dye is heard making adjectives sweat like
a harvest hand in depicting the virtues and greatness of
Mr. Hearst. For proof of what we say we need only,
to refer our readers to the columns of Mr. Hearst's
papers. But in 'the Des Moines convention the follow
ers of Parker, outvoted, outclassed, and outlawed, re
sorted to ribald interruption.' Whenever his boom struck
the rock of oratory, and produced an affluent fountain
of beautiful paeans) the Parker parties damned the
pactolian stream byVtotally irrelevant inquiries as to
the amount the orator received for the vocal bouton
nieres he Was pinning on Â«Mr. Hearst's coat. This pain
ful species of cold-blooded interruption was varied by
referring to the. orators collar as brass and specula
tions as to its cost, when probably if was no worse
material than celluloid.
So the light that should shind in the speeches w?i
compelled to flicker, in the resolutions. These assail
the evils of taxation and whack the trusts and do them
to a finish. They are accused of seizing every avenue
of human endeavor and that it "is compelled to pay
tribute or cease to exist?' We heartily agree that levy
ing tribute on an avenue is actionable and ought to be
stopped. Avenues have a hard time any way. This
maltreatment of avenues is in the next resolution
charged up to the tariff. , We Venture to quote the tariff
plank entire: "We denounce the vicious tr.riff system,
fostered and perpetuated by the Republican party, under
which the trusts have been born, ' bred, fattened and
multiplied, until they have every industrial interest by
the throat, and we demand the repeal of every tariff
which denies equal opportunities for all."
So it is the apparent purpose to make an assault upon
protection, via the. trusts, and Mr. Hearst will repeal
every tariff that denies equal opportunity for all. Per
haps it would be ungracious to call upon him for a
bill of particulars/to specify the "every tariff*.' that is
doing these mean things to poor old "equal 'opportunity."
A man who is out for Lincoln's boots should not be dis
turbed by such questions.

The puffy and poor orange has not yet appeared in
the Northern California citrus belt. But orchard owners
will do well to study the subject, for prevention is
easier than cure. In deciduous orchards poor fruit is
sure to follow over-bearing. The deciduous orchards
in which the fruit is judiciously thinned continue to
produce first quality crops and fruit of even size and
excellence. We believe that the Southern California
orange growers have not thinned their crops. The
anxiety for many boxes and many carloads for export
leads them to leave the trees to bear at will. It is
not possible, even in citrus fruits, to associate excel
lence with over-bearing. We agree with Mr. Jeffrey that
the popularity of citrus fruit from his section will surely
wane "unless the growers find some means of suppress
ing the production of so many carloads that cannot
be handled to the consumer without decay, and with
out other poor qualities that are now so disastrous to
We suggest that they try thinning to the extent of a
few thousand carloads, while adopting such other means
as deeper fertilization and shading the soil.

comes up for hearing, he must appear
In court prepared to show what he has

particularly $3000 his wife alleges he
received as his share of real estate sold
by the San Francisco Stock Exchange
Board. The notice was issued yester
day by Judge Kerrigan.
Judge Murasky has denied Euphemla
Happersberger a new trial of the suit
for divorce she brought against Dr.
Albert K. Happersberger. When her
suit was filed nearly two years ago the
physician filed a cross-complaint
charging cruelty and secured a decree.
E. T. B. Mills, secretary of Nevill &
Co., has signed an agreement to pay to
Evelyn B. Mills, his former wife, $150 a
month alimony until May. 1905. From
that time he will pay her $175 a month
for the rest of her life. The agreement
was filed with the County Clerk yester
day.
The first absolute decree of divorce,
which the last Legislature provided
should be issued one year after an In
terlocutory decree had been granted,
was filed with the County Clerk yester
day. It bears the signature of Judge
Hebbard and absolutely divorces Joan
Mosetta Matlock from William Mat
lock. Matlock was given an interlocu
tory decree May 4 of last year.
Phillip Kohn, the theatrical manager,
who is being sued for maintenance by
Estelle Kohn, did not put In an ap
pearance yesterday in Judge Seawell's
court, where there is pending a motion
to transfer the suit to Marin County,
where the suit for divorce he has
brought against Mrs. Kohn is to be
heard. Because of the absence of
Kohn the case was put over until
May 13.
Judge Hebbard granted decrees of
divorce for cruelty yesterday to Mary
F. McHugh from William McHugh and
Delia B. Kling from Clarence B. Kling.
He allowed Mrs. Kling $30 a month ali
mony and Mrs. McHugh 525 a month.
Judge Troutt granted Eleanor Wil
liams a divorce from Charles H. Wil
liams for desertion and Lois A. G. Tra
verse a divorce from Dr. Alfred W.
Traverse for infidelity. Dr. A. P. Ag
new, a so-called friend of the defend
ant, furnished the evidence that ne
abled Mrs. Traverse to obtain a decree.
Judge Kerrigan gave Charles H. Hol
comb a divorce from Emma E. Hol
comb for neglect and Edith Olsen a di
vorce from G. Olsen for cruelty.
FIRST ABSOLUTE DECREE.
John H. Barron, who is the defend
ant in the suit for divorce brought by
Katie Barron. has answered her suit
with a general denial of her charges
of neglect and desertion and in a cross
complaint asks that he be given a de
cree on the ground of cruelty.
Charles J. Porter was 'granted a di
vorce from Edith Porter (nee Biller)
by Judge Kerrigan yesterday on the
ground of his wife's infidelity. The
Porters were married at Chicago in
April, 1900. It was In July of last year
.that the acts complained of were com
mitted.
BARROX ANSWERS SUIT.
Because she claims to have discov
ered that she Is no longer her hus
band's affinity is the reason why Flor
ence L. Van Warner is seeking a di
vorce from Roy L. Van "Warner, â¢ a
book agent. In her complaint, which
was filed yesterday, she says that on
April 1 last, on his return from Los
Angele3, after an absence of, six
months, he drew a letter from' his
pocket and told her it was from the
woman he loved. VI love you no
longer," she alleges he v remarked.
"This is from my affinity. I love her
alone and I must be with her."
Mrs. Van Warner also complains of
several other acts of her husband. She
says that three months after their
marriage at Cleveland, Ohio, In 1898,
he began neglecting her and caused her
great worry and anguish by remaining
out until all hours of the night and
spending his earnings in a riotous
manner and paying more attention to
the gaming table than to her. She also
charges that frequently during their
married life she has suffered mentally
because of his failure to provide her
with funds to pay bills contracted by
her for necessities. The Van Warners
have been living at 1661 Octavia street-
Suits for divorce were also filed by
Luther C. Fabian against Emily Banks
Fabian for infidelity, Clara B. Shull
against Edmund B. Shull for desertion.
Fuchs appeared to be perfectly
sane on all s'ubjects but that of fin
ance; He persisted in explaining to
his fellow inmates that he was still
a man of means and that he would
some day be in a position to take them
all away and show them a life of ease
and luxury-. Little attention was paid
to his remarks, and every one that
knew, him believed him to be insane,
few being aware of his past history.
Fuchs was but 56 years of age,
though he appeared to be much older.
After his death frienda had Fuchs' re
mains removed to the parlors of Ha
gan's undertaking establishment, from
which place the funeral will be held
to-day.
Henry Fuchs, once a multi-million
aire, passed away yesterday at the
city's almshouse, which was his home
for the last two years of his life. ,.
Fuchs was a partner of John T.
Gates, the Eastern steel magnate, not
long ago, but the strain of responsi
bility that accompanies the controlling
of millions told on him, physically and,
mentally, and after having spent many
months In poor health, he came to
California in the hope of renewing his
strength.
Even the climate . of California,
however, had not the desired effect
Fuchs' physical condition gradually
grew worse and hi3 fortune ebbed
with his health, leaving him penniless
and mentally worn out.
He was taken to a private hospital
in this city and regular remittances
from his former partner paid for his
meddcal treatment. Skilled physicians
did their utmost toward rebuilding the
worn out constitution. All efforts were
in vain, however, and he was given up
as Incurable. He was next sent to the
Almshouse and Gates continued to
send money to pay for small luxuries
that might make the invalid's life
more endurable.

1 . Miss Hapgood tells how she was curfed
of Fallopian and Ovarian Inflammation â

Lydia E Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
"Dear Mrs. Pcskiiam:â I suffered for four years with what the
doctors called Salpingitis (inflammation of the fallopian tubes) and ova-

by heat and shooting- pains, should claim your instant attention. It will not

; NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Frank Reed is developing Into quite
a wonder at piloting two-year-olds.
He had the leg up on David Boland, a
6 to 1 chance, for the; half mile dash,
and, soon showing first with his mount,
led Edgecliff over the line a couple of
lengths. Lucrece, the favorite, was al
most thrown on the far turn, running
unplaced; Hooligan took the show.
An even dozen faced the barrier In
the mile selling affair. The odds about
Chileno were hammered down from S
to 5 to 11 to 10 and, with Crosswaite up,
the gelding went out and spreadeagled
his field. . Resigned took the place, a
couple of lengths ahead of Dollie H,
an outsider.
During the closing days of a long
racing season the bookmakers usually
reap a harvest, but not so yesterday at
Oakland. Four Heavily backed favor
ites marched home first, casting a
gloom over the ring. The fields were

It is on the lines of the Pari mututl
box, but much larger. . The inventor
claims ,that five machines, each oper
ated by three men, have repeatedly
handled $135,000 in one day.. He also
claims the machine has superseded trie
bookmaker at South Australia, Tas
mania, New Zealand and other points.
He says it shows a profit both to the
association and to the bettors. The mar
chine may be used at the circuit meet
ings this season.
Australia, which gave to the Ameri
can turf the starting gate and num
bered saddle cloths, may send over an
other turf novelty. T. E. Ward, an
Australian, is showing a betting ma

claimed to be a decided improvement

THE MERRY BOOKMAKER
The Amateur Driving and Athletic
Association will not turn over, the
$10,000 already on hand to the Park
Commissioners for the purpose of
building an athletic amphitheater in
Golden Gate Park unless positive as
surance is given that the work will be
rushed to completion in the event of
any failure to raise the entire $25,000.
That much . was decided upon last
night and a committee of seven was
appointed to wait on the Commission
ers this afternoon to see what ar
rangements can be made. It was thÂ«
sense of the meeting that the associa
tion had no authority- to give up any
of the funds on hand without a def
inite agreement. It was suggested that
it might be possible to do the work for
a smaller sum than was at first agreed
upon.
In many ways the meeting was the
most satisfactory held in the history
of the association. "William Blackweli
of the California Lacrosse Association
was on hand to say that his organiza
tion had determined to give an ex
hibition game between teams of
picked men on the 22d inst. and the
receipts would be added to the asso
ciation fund. The Cycle Board of
Trade also wishes to give a race meet
for the same purpose, and it will
probably be held during the second
week in June. A committee of wheel
men spent the greater portion of yes
terday in raising money and reported
.$600 pledged as the result. Captain
Max Rosenfeld of the Olympic Club
stated the directors had decided to
add $500 to the list, contingent upon
the affair being truly amateur. As
the association was able to guarantee
the quality of the scheme the $50")
pledge was placed on the records.
Word was also received that James D.
Phelan had signified his intention of
subscribing after visiting Superintend
ent McLaren of Golden Gate Park and
learning the scope of the project.

The first betting was 3 to.l against
Irish Lad. but heavy wagers sent his
price down to 7 to 6.
The race was worth to the winner
about $11,500, $2000 to the second and
$1000 to the third horse.
Meanwhile Irish Lad was . leading
through the first and second quarters
of the race with a scattered field be
hind him, its members constantly
changing position, with Mamie Worth.
Toboggan, Red Knight, Stalwart and
Damon his closest followers. Mamie
Worth euit at the five-eighths pole.
Something seemed to discourage
Highball .Just before the last turn was
reached and he backed up as if done.
He was clear at the time and no rea
son for his faltering was apparent, es
pecially in view of the fact that he
came on again strongly in the stretch.
IRISH LAD RESPONDS GAMELY.
Coming around the last turn Irish
Lad held his lead, but the others began
to draw nearer as they straightened
out for home. Irish Lad seemed to
slow up as if to encourage his compet
itors, but Shaw was.tcking 110 chances.
With hand6 and heels he urged on the
leader and Irish Lad responded quick
ly. His apparent faltering had en
couraged the others, and Cochran on
Red Knight. Bullman on Highball and
Burns on Toboggan began to ride like
mad, believing they saw a chance to
snatch the prize.
It was a vain hope, however, for the
Candlemas colt was going easily, and
without an effort increased his advan
tage a length, gaining still more as he
neared the end and winning by two
lengths from Toboggan, which was
tired but game.
Damon was first to break, but before
the sixteenth pole was reached Irish
Lad had gone through on the rail and
was two lengths in front. Here an
accident occurred that might have
proved serious. Lord Badge, ridden by
Cormack and heavily backed for sec
ond and third places, was well away
from the post and near the outer rail.
Beldame, with Brennan up, was In the
middle of the bunch and was one of the
first away. As soon as she got into her
stride she bolted toward the outer
fence and struck Lord Badge sharply,
knocking the horse down on his side.
Cormack was sent rolling in the dust,
but arose uninjured. Lord Badge
Jumped to his feet quickly and was not
hurt.
NEW YORK. May 6.â Irish Lad,
owned by Harry Payne Whitney and
running In the name and colors of his
partner, Herman B. Duryea, won the
thirteenth renewal of the Metropolitan
handicap over the Withers mile at
Morris Park to-day in easy fashion.
He was carrying the top weight- and
was favorite In the betting by many
points. Taking the lead in the first
hundred yards, he led his field without
trouble, although the pace was fast
The horse seemed to feel his superior
ity and at the three-quarters slackened
his speed as if unwilling to run faster
than necessary. As a result the field
closed up on him. Shaw then gave his
mount a vigorous shaking up and Irish
Lad drew out and won by two lengths
from Toboggan, an added starter from
the Keene stable. Beldame, winner of
the Carter handicap a few weeks ago.
was third, after a nose and nose finish
with the much^vaunted Highball.
All the entries that seemed to have a
chance to win were away from the post
well except Lux Casta. That erratic
mare and Highball were disturbing
factors at the start, which was delayed
for several minutes. When the flag fell
the horses were fairly well aligned.
City Bank, the eleventh-hour entry of
John E. Madden, and Toboggan get
ting the worst of the send-off.
LORD BADGE KNOCKED DOWN.

Doc Newton yesterday at Recreation
Park. Of course, Jimmy thought he
<jould win.. Perhaps he might have
turned the trick had the fourth, fifth
and ninth rounds been eliminated.. It
Â¦was during these stormy periods that
the Angels from sunny climes made
runs. Score 10 to 2.
For three innings the game was a
blissful siege, with no runs showing on
the horizon. The storm clouds gathered
In the fourth, when Bernard lined the
ball out to right field for a swell double.
Flood fanned and Smith walked. Cra
vath had the big hit in his bat this
time, and Bernard hot-footed home.
Smith pulled up at. third Just as Ross
hit to Whalen so warmly that he could
not handle it with much ease. Chase
forced Cravath at third, but Toman and
Spies came through with blngles, and
thusly It is the tale of the first four.
Hank's collection handed it to the
Doc a little in the same round. Irwln
connected squarely nith one that went
to the fence for a along single. Leahy
received a slap In the plexus. Big Bill
Massey stood up and took two strikes.
Newton;tried to wing another over on
the ponflerous lad, but he hit oft a*daz
zler to left field, which started a howl
among the bleacherites and caused Ir
wln and Leahy to the finish.
The Angels were not at all satisfied
with four. In the next period they ac
cumulated three extra ones. Bernard
led off again with a hit and Flood sac
rificed. Smith and Cravath walked, and
when Ross doubled over third the first
two arrived. Cravath came in soon
after while Chase was being retired by
the short-first route.
It was all tranquillity and good base
ball from that time on to the ninth,
when the Angels squeezed in three
more. Spies hit and Newton walked.
Both were advanced on Flood's out,
and both arrived when Jimmy Whalen
erred on Massey's throw of a stop from
Smith's club. Cravath put the finish
ing touches on the artistic windup by
clouting out a two-cushion swipe to the
flagpole. The score:

The twelfth renewal of the California
Associated Cyclists' 100-mile relay race
from this city to Alameda by way of
San Jose will be held on Sunday. This
race ha* proved the most wonderful of
its kind, as In no other part of tha
world have wheelmen been able to find
a circular 'course where the start and
the finish would be in such proximity.
This will be the second race for the
W. B. Morrlll trophy, which was won
last year by the Garden City Wheel
men. Five clubs will be represented in
the race. Each will have ten couriers
and each of these will ride ten miles.
In the past the greatest riders the coast
has knownâ Edwards, Ziegler, McFar-
Iand, "Wells, Ruaa, Coulter, Foster, Ful
ler. Downing. Smith. Deacon. Mott.
Byrnes. Albrecht. Delmas. Kragness.
Wing and a host of othersâ have strug
gled on the road for no reward other
than club glory.
The race has been won once by the
Acme Club, once by the Olympic Club
Wheelmen; four times by the Bay City
Wheelmen and five times by the Gar
den City Wheelmen." The entries for
Sunday's race are:
First relayâ F. G. West. Bay City "WTieel

Major Parker W. West, aid to Gen
eral MacArthur, paid a visit yesterday
morning to the new rifle range Just
completed at Rodeo Valley, and reports
that he is much pleased with the range
and the work that has been done there.
The first battalion of the Tenth In
fantry, under command of Captain
James T. Dean, Is now at practice
there. They expect to finish Saturday,
when they will return to the Presidio.
The third battalion of the Tenth, under
command of Major Robert C. Van
Vliet, will go' to .Rodeo next Monday.
Major West says the range, for Its
class, is one of the best in the country.
Its limit at the present time is 600
yards. It is located in a beautiful val
ley Just over the hills back of Fort
Baker, and between that point and the
ocean beach. It is about four miles
from the wharf' at Fort Baker and six
miles from Sausalito.
Major West says it is to be regretted
that the farming land adjoining could
not have been secured at a reasonable
price, so that a range of full limits
could have been constructed. The price
demanded for this land the Government
considered prohibitive. Everything
about the camp is now complete. A fine
supply of mountain spring water has
been secured and run Into the -grounds
occupied by the different companies.
When the last battalion of the Tenth
Is through, the Twenty-eighth Infantry
will go over, and these in turn will be
followed by the third squadron of the
Ninth Cavalry. This will extend the
practice to September. Lieutenant TV*.
H. Patterson is acting as quartermaster
of the range. The telephone system is
now in working order.
The Tenth Infantry is putting up a
fine series of drills every morning. The
drill. yesterday was witnessed by. a big
crowd. The work of the regiment dur
ing the Butts manual of arms exer
cise was good.
The Twenty-eighth Infantry, under
command of Captain William L. Pitch
er, drills every afternoon at 3 o'clock,
with dress parade and band at 5 o'clock.
Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Godwin,
Ninth Cavalry, has arrived from St.
Louis, where he has been stationed on
the exposition grounds. He will at once
take command of the squadron of the
Ninth now at the post. Some brilliant
problem exercises on the lines recently
introduced by Major Bigelow will prob
ably be immediately put under way.

TOLEDO, Ohio, May 5.â For twenty

Twenty-four years ago her father,

' Mrs. Cousins read that "Bill" Nich

tentiary, under sentence of death for
having killed a man at Kenton, Ohio.
She wrote to the penitentiary authori

PKISONEK- BREAKS DOWN
Sad Ending of Daughter's
Twenty-Four Years' Quest
of Her Missing Parent
When they had earned enough money
to enable them to return to Chicago no
time was wasted by White and Purcell
in getting there, for they had enough
experience as roadsters to convince
them that there was no \ place like
home. But as .the, weeks sped and
nothing was heard of or from Shea by
his parents and friends the heroism
that attached to White and Purcell on
account of their exploit began to wear
off, and finally they were twitted with
cowardice In deserting their compan r
ion, and some nersons even, went so
far as to accuse them of having
"made away With" him. Then they
started westward to ascertain what
had become of him and to relieve
themselveB of unjust suspicion. Again
they rode in cold b.: cars and astride
brakebeams. . After passing Elko they
began to make inquiries, and bit by
bit they, traced Shea to. San Francisco.
Soon after their arrival here last
Wednesday the two boys met the ob
ject of their' quest on Kearny street.
They informed; him' of the situation in
which his absence from home, had
placed them, and he agreed to accom
pany: them back there and rehabilitate
them in the esteem of their neighbors.
Eut he was penniless. So â¢ were they.
To' obtain the price of fares across the
bay they all-began begging, and almost
the first person asked for alms by
Shea was Police Officer Farrell In plain
attire. The lad was arrested and yes
terday morning Judge Mogan pro
nounced him guilty of .mendicancy and
ordered him to appear this morning for
sentenced ' -> ',
William Finnigan, who resides at
Golden Gate avenue and â¢ Larkin : street,
was , escorting a New York friend of his
through the , Hall of Justice ' yesterday
afternoon, ; and while visiting the prison
their; attention , was directed by , the
Bernard Shea, Oliver Purcell and
Frank White, each in his eighteenth
year of existence, were employed as
messenger boys by the United States
Express Company in Chicago when
they received their week's wages one
Saturday last j March and spent the
greater part of the money in a "penny
arcade." Then, afraid to face their re
spective parents, with a total fund of
$2 15 they started for San Francisco.
It was rough traveling for the trio,
as the brake beams were ice-sheathed
and the temperature of the box cars
chilling, but they .managed to remain
together until Ogden was reached.
Master White got employment and
stayed there, and the other two tour
ists resumed their journey. At Elko,
Nevada, a job was offered to and ac
cepted by Master Purcell. Master Shea
continued his coastward trip alone.
Frank L. Shannon's slide trombone
will not awake, the echoes of the Bar
bary Coast for ten days to come, for
he was sentenced to imprisonment dur
ing that period by Judge Mogan.
"And at the expiration of your term,"
said his Honor, "you would practice
wisdom by conveying your implement
c-f torture to some region far removed
from the dance halls of Pacific street."
There will be no immediate jangling
of wedding bells for sixteen-year-old
Allie Warner and twenty-five-year-old
H. W. Meyers, because Judge Fritz has
sent the lass to a hospital and to-day
will send the lad to priscm. The pro
posed hymenial solution of the prob
lem that confronted his Honor may be
considered "off."
Meyers was arrested for battery, the
complaining witness being the girl's
mother, who had reason to- believe that
their relationship was not entirely
proper. They were emerging from an
Ellis-street lodging 1 j-house when Mrs;
Warner met them and -Meyers struck
her, she alleges, wh/le she was endeav
oring to persuade her daughter to
abandon him; At the first hearing of
the case Officer Young of -the S. P. C.
C. tried to effect a settlement by hav
ing the voung coupde married, and
Judge Fritz seemed to approve that
Idea until he ascertained that the girl's
parents, who are divorced, opposed
such a union 'on the ground that
Meyers was not a fit person to have
control of their daughter.
When the case was called yesterday
the girl was In court and created some
thing of a sensation by swooning. In
quiry developed the fact that she Is
affected with a malady that only a sur
gical operation can relieve, and the
Judge promptly ordered her removal
to a hospital. Then he found Meyers
guilty as charged and ordered him to
appear to-day for sentence.
Maggie Flaws, chronic vagrant, shed
tears when Judge Mogan sentenced her
to six months' imprisonment, and as
she sat upon the prisoners' bench a
professional evangelist who once was
famed as "Rebel George," confidence
operator, took her hand and whispered
words of kindly counsel. His minis
trations were continued until the unfor
tunate creature entered the elevator
that hoisted her back to prison, and
then he expressed belief that before her
term of incarceration expires she will
be eager to lead a better life. But po
licemen who have known Maggie for
years opine that she is too old and too
vice-hardened to undergo permanent
reformation.
.As the legal representative of Henry
Selby, accused of having lottery tickets
in his possession, Mr. Rose'called out in
loud voice to the complaining police
man to postpone the case until a felony
charge then under hearing could be
disposed of, and Bailiff Mahoney re
quested him to keep still. To this the
attorney retorted angrily, and attempt
od to enter the Inclosure and speak to
the policeman, and the bailiff again
called for order and pushed him back.
Angry remonstrance from the attorney
was followed by a sharp reminder from
the bench that it was the duty of the
bailiff to take into custody any one
who created disorder, attorneys not ex
cepted. Rose retaliated with language
that was disrespectful, and the next
moment he was in the custody of
Bailiff HIckey and among the prisoners
on the bench. His expostulations con
tinued until the Judge said he would
be obliged to send him to prison if he
did not desist, and his reply was that
he "would rather be up there among
gentlemen." Up there he accordingly
was sent.
Meantime the defendant represented
by the incarcerated attorney walked
out of the courtroom without hindrance,
and when his case was called there was
no response for the defense. It will 'be,
called again this morning.
Attorney George F. Rose spent sev
eral of yesterday's shining hours under
detention in the City Prison, with
charges of disturbing the peace and
contempt of court filed against him by
Judge Mogan. From about 10:30 o'clock
a. m. until evening's shades, were fall
ing the unhappy lawyer' dwelt fn dur
ance. Then he was released on bail to
appear this mornilg and hear some
more things about what does and what
does not constitute becoming conduct
in a Police Court.
May Gorman's name was stricken
from Judge Mogan's calendar because
Henry Meyer could not positively swear
that she had robbed him of $6 85, as al
leged in his complaint, and she was
congratulating herself on restoration to
freedom when a policeman's hand
clasped" her shoulder and led her back
to prison, where she is booked for va
grancy. But It is not so much with the
object of punishing the woman for va
grancy as to keep a dangerous charac
ter from roaming at large that the re
arrest was made. The police have rec
ognized May Gorman as Mabel Keat
ing, one of the most artistic pickpock
ets on the. thieves' register. She has
served two years in the Washington
State prison for plying her vocation
in Seattle, and prior to that she was a
most successful operator in this city â
as success is measured by ability to
get away with the goods and elude
conviction. She denies her identity, of
course, but the detectives are positive
that May Gorman and Mabel Keating
are one person.
John Gibbons, John Coffey and Henry
Bailey, charged with burglarizing a
tannery, are held In ?1000 apiece to an
swer to the Superior Court.* They were
examined before Judge Fritz.
Justin Carroul heard mysterious
noises in his residence at 108 Sixth
street night before last, and he notified
Patrolman Kruck, who searched the
dwelling and found Eugene \ McCabe
concealed in one of the rooms. The
charge of burglary will be heard to
morrow by Judge Mogan.
T. Maxwell said he was carrying food
to the non-union employes of a Bush
street livery, stable when a policeman
stopped him, dispossessed him of a six
shooter and then arrested him for car
rying concealed weapons. The police
man stated that he had acted on in
formation received from some striking
hostlers, who said their lives had been
threatened by the defendant. Further
hearing will be had by Judge Mogan
on May 11. â¢
Â»Â¦ â¢ Â¦ â¢
Judge Mogan. heard the testimony
and then took the case under advise
ment.
That broke up the game of hearts.
Mr. Fell went outside and blew a po
lice whistle until Mr. Mulkeen followed
him and again smote his face with
clenched fist. Then the assailed one
pocketed his whistle and went and had
a warrant Issued for the arrest of Mr.
Mulkeen. . -
Hearts was the game, and amenity
marked it until Patrick Mulkeen and
E. D. Fell began to exchange com
ment on the recent Slav repulse in
Manchuria. From that moment good
fellowship waned until the barroom of
the grocery at Clay and Fillmore
streets rang with rough-edged repartee.
"England would better keep her hand
out of that scrap," said Mr. Mulkeen,
leading trumps.
"Oh, I dunno," quoth Mr. Fell, rak
ing in the trick. "England's able to
take care of any trouble she gets into."
"And Germany, too, would be wise to
hold aloof," rejoined Mr. Mulkeen. "If
she butts in you'll see Russia and
France join hands and lick both Ger
many and England."
"England treated you pretty well by
allowing you to come to this country,"
retorted Mr. Feil. "You wouldn't be
here if it hadn't been for the Queen.'.*
Biff! Air. Feil's eyes received the
blow, and Mr. Mulkeen's knuckles ad
ministered it.
James Kelly, originally booked for
robbery, then accused of grand larceny
and finally charged with petty larceny,
was convicted of the latter offense and
sentenced to six months' imprisonment
by Judge Fritz. Neither of the more seri
ous charges could be made to adhere
by a relentless prosecution.
The result of it all was that the New
Yorker., offered to pay the fares of the
trio to Chicago if Judge Mogan could
be persuaded to liberate Master Shea,
and after the conditions were explained
to his Honor he promptly signed â¢ the
desired order of release. Then the
three lads went up to the bench and
thanked the Judge, shook hands with
their benefactor from Manhattan, ex
pressed sincere gratitude to Mr. Fin
nigan and sallied forth with beaming
faces.
- "Before we left home," said Master
Purcell, "all the boys we know boy
cotted us, and not one of the girls
would have anything to do with us."
"'Cause you see, sir," said Master
Purcell to the Gothamite, "we've got to
get Shea back home to fix us all right
with the folks."
"That's the idea," said Master White.
"We came all the way out here to set
him. and we ain't going back without
him."
desk sergeant to three boys seated
upon one of the benches and engaged
in earnest conversation. The New-
Yorker, who is interested in prisons
and prison . reform, Interviewed' the
lads, receiving the story hereinbefore'
set forth. White and Purcell were vis
iting Shea and assuring him that they
would remain near him until his sen
tence expired and they had acquired
sufficient capital to pay three fares to

* j lt.Rfh member of the company had a
' Vrure of friends on the wharf, and as
â¢ iieaj-fyevery oilier of the Sierra's many
IwisScnserg was equally attended the
cajjacJiy of the wharf was taxed to

â¢*.'i>' nocRSaies to friends who were not

gotxl luck for the voyager? and re
.nernbrances CO somebody In Honolulu
..Â«jr i'n the Antipodes, and everybody
! . shouted his moFSagre at the same time
. .and keiit repeating it in chorus until
â¢*UXf lin<*r> lines were cast off.
â¢ Miss Meyers â "Tootsie,** as she is
jKnown in the theatrical family which
h&s adopted herâ was the heroine of a
little comedy that, judging by "Toot
t-i^'e" tears, seemed tragedy of deepest j
\ hue to her.
*. . ""footsie"' loves the stage and Its peo
. pie. * - 'Tootsie's" papa, however, cares
1 little for-either and loves his little girl
inore .than all the American travesty
, companies" that ever went to sea. '
."'TootFic" is just IT, and her aptness
t*>hind the footlights has added more
..'than a lew dollars to the family ex-
" m * hwquer. Just l>efore the liner pulled
:"<;ui Meyers ;iere rushed on the wharf
ti'nd asked Police Sergeant Mahoney to
assist him in recovering his daughter
who was going away without his eon
- eetit and against his wish. Tearful !
â¢ - nd objecting, "Tootsie" was led ashore. j
â¢ -The pleading of her theatrical friends !
*ci<ide no impression on Mr. Meyers, but
,*. ''iirn "'Tootsie" got "dad" to herself
irnder the lee of a pile of freight she did
that produced results
;n jtsst three minutes. Tearful but tri
- umphant, she remounted the gangway
aw} resumed her place with her friends
wf the song and dance. Mr. Meyers

Read carefully. An honest proposition.
(You to be full Judge.)
I do hereby solemnly agree and guarantee to
make no charge If I fail to tell your name, oc-
cupation and what you called for; I tel: you If
husband, wife or lover Is true or false; who and
when you will marry; how to gain the love of
the one you desire: "in fact," I will tell you
every hope, fear or ambition better than you
can tell yourself; his advice Is reliable; his
powers are wonderful and Indisputable; he Im-
proves your character so that you will reach
the highest possible development in mental
vigor, health, happiness and capacity to earn
wealth; the controlling power implanted In your
nature, so you can control any one secretly;

THE FUTURE REVEALED, THE PAST
DISCLOSED.

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Klammar Ion's treatise that Is
so electrifying the . world to-day. He is no
Imitator. His work Is upon original lines.'
pure thought, clear vision.- He tells you what
you desire to know and works ln tho open
light.
He ia aa conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he Is for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness. â¢
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life readlnc for $1. A test
is of little value: when the mind is troubled
you- need more substantial aid and advice.
This is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on: him for a Hrst-
class clairvoyant readlnc.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are hÂ«ir to. You are acquainted
with the facts ln your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyzÂ» the matters . that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and'
BUggest the remedy.

TOPEKA, .Kan.. May 6.â Up to this
time the indications are that the Santa
Fe is ahead in the contest with the In
ternational Association of . Machinists
regarding the strike on the system.
None' of the engines of the company
have been injured and the only delay
to trains has been caused by the rains.
Within forty-eight hours the ma
chinists will submit a proposition to the
management of the road for a settle
ment of the strike. They will not in
sist on a closed shop, according to the
statement of Third Vice . President
Buckalew, but want a definite con
tract with the road after the fashion
of those held by the engineers, firemen
and others. ;Â¦-'â¢'-â¢
Reports from various points along
the system indicate that some of the
strikers are going. back. to work. -At
Emporia the president of the local
union has deserted the ranks of the
strikers.
General Manager Mudge is well sat
isfied with the situation.
Buckalew will leave at the end of
this week for Cleburne. Tex.,' to take
personal charge of the strike there.
"The men there would rather fight
than eat," said he, "and it is necessary
to have somebody on the ground to rule
them. The men here in Topeka are
more amenable to reason and will abide
by my orders."

Nasi was a strong- politician and it
wrfs believed he was destined to be
come Premier. The result of the par
liamentary Inquiry into - his conduct
has caused great excitement.
ROME, May E. â There was a grreat
sensation In the Chamber of Deputies
to-day at the conclusion of the parlia
mentary Inquiry Into the administra
tion of SIgnor Nasi, former Minister of
Public Instruction. The inquiry proved
Nasi guilty of the misappropriation of
large sums of money, the falsification
of documents, the suppression of evi
dence and continuous peculation.
The law courts presented to the
Chamber a demand that they be al
lowed to proceed against Nasi and ar
rest him, but under the rules of the
Chamber the discussion of this demand
was postponed until Saturday next.
Meanwhile the news that Nasi had
been declared guilty of the charges
against him spread, and the former
Minister lied.

The second and last concert of Mme.
Sembrich will.be given to-morrow, and
as the singer Is resting to-day those
in attendance will probably hear ths
greatest living coloratura singer at her
best. The house, by the way, is almost
sold out. . â¢ f .
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
How nearly there came to being no
concert last night at the Alhambra
only a few people know. It was a toss
up whether or . not Mme. Sembrich
could sing, indisposition consequent
upon the fatigue of travel and anxiety
concerning the severe Illness of her
mother almost preventing the appear
ance of the diva. Yet. with the char
acteristic courage that won her the
record of being the only artist of the
last grand^opera season that never
missed a. performance, Sembrich sang.
For her own sake it would have been
perhaps better if she had not. Yet there
would have been one of the most bril
liant audiences that ever foregathered
in San Francisco disappointed.
For San Francisco has not forgotten
Sembrich. Who does not remember her
arch and brilliant Roslna of that first
almost unheralded appearance of four
years ago? She was ailing then and the
season closed with the one performance.
With our first grand opera she be
stowed upon us that wonderful Vio
letta, through which we discovered that
Mr. Grau had presented to us the
greatest coloratura artist of the day.
Then followed her Rosina in Its perfec
tion, then Marguerite and then the
nevcr-to-be-forgotton Suzanna with
Eames' adorable Countess in "The
Marriage of Figaro." These things the
people held in mind, and this Sembrich
they went to hear last night. They
went, too, frankly to compare their
loves of Schumann-Heink and Sem
brich, of vastly different genre though
the sinerers are.
But Sembrich was not In her usual
form last nightâ that is doubtless re
served for* to-morrow's concert. The
Voice lacked color and resonance, and
thinned out in volume considerably in
the upper notes. Nor was even the
phrase quite the pure and perfect thing,
the very pearl rounded and polished,
that we have come to know as Sem- |
brich's. The voice sounded tired; the
superb spirit seemed weary. It is not
at all that one did not get much in- \
comparable singing even last night; :
only Is it that the Sembrich of last ;
night suffered in comparison with the
Sembrich of two years ago, and I'm
waiting until to-morrow for the singer
In her glory.
Half-past eight was gone before the
huge crowd was seated. Five minutes
afterward the charming face of the
diva beamed out upon it, over a very
breastplate of diamonds and a highly
becoming: shimmer gown. And then we
had Mozart, after the thunderous greet
ing, the "Deh Vieni" from "The Mar
riage of Figaro." Its first notes sound
ed an alarm, but one felt that this as
an opening number would serve to
warm up the voice. Neitherâ though
It was not Sembrich Mozartâ was there
lacking much of the inimitable witch
ery of that most fascinating quantity.
And what delight to hear the perfect
attack, the rare shading of the phrase,
the fluent flow of the voice. "Oh, Had I
Jubal's Lyre," from the Handel
"Joshua," came next. Here It became
evident that the singer was singing un
der difficulties. The voice was unable
to fill in the heroic outline of the mental
conception, and was obviously under
slralru Then the less exacting "Neue
Liebe, Neu es Leben" of Beethoven
was sung with greater ease and a
charm that compelled art Imperious re
call, to which madame responded with
Mozart's "Veilchen."
Her best rfumber was the Schumann
"Xussbaum," given with surpassing
delicacy and grace, though the singer
seemed to forget for a moment her in
disposition in a rendering almost
worthy of herself of "Ah, fors e lui,"
that she singg as no one else can or
perhaps ever has. Very charming Is
the "Staendchen" of Richard Strauss
that madame introduced to us last
night. And delightfully played was
the accompaniment of Rudolph Ganz K
a prince of accompanists. Sembrich
also gave a song by Mr. Ganz entitled
"Summer," an ambitious effort, bril
liant in character, and but for some
abrupt and purposeless harmonic
changes, pleasing. The Schumann
"Widmung" was another number and
the Strauss "Primavera" valse, with
much of its old lusciousness of render
ing, closed the programme.
Mr. Ganz, whose accompaniments are
so admirable a feature of the concerts,
was heard* also in a solo. He is ri
pi&nist to be .seriously considered,
scholarly and brilliant, not with a-i
over-plus of temperament, perhaps, nor
yet with the tonal magic of a Haroii
Bauer, but yet an artist and a scholar.
His numbprs were the Chopin Ballade
(G minor), Etude in A minor -<op. 25) â
taken at a tempo that even outran
Bauer'sâ the Liszt "Cantique d'Amour"
and Polonaise in E major, all heartily
enjoyed by the audience.
Mrs. Elizabeth H. B. Varney, aged
85 years, died last nig-ht at her home,
1303 Seventh avenue, leaving two
sons, Henry and T. II. B. Varney, and
one daughter. Miss Mary Varney.
OAKLAND, May 5. â Robert Me-
Curdy, a pioneer resident of this city,
died in San Francisco this morning,
aged 74 years. The deceased came to
Oakland in 1S61 and resided here un
til a short time ago. He -leaves one
son, John McCurdy, and three daugh
ters. Mrs. M. Ash,' Mrs. S. Godfrey
and Mrs. Charles Symons.
Mrs. Sarah M. Thompson, widow of
the late ex-Councilman, Peter Thomp
son, died last night at her home, 1431
Webster street, aged 74 years. The
deceased leaves two sons, David
Thompson and W. E. Thompson, and
one daughter, Miss Lucy Thompson.
David Thompson resides in England.
He was notified by telegraph of his
mother's- serious illness and was able
to reach Oakland before she died.
Alnmcda County Deaths.
The uproar lasted fully twenty min
utes, and appeared to be due to dissat
isfaction over the exclusion of Miss
Mabel Terry Lewis from the cast.
"The Bride and. Bridegroom," not
withstanding that it Is brightly written,
proved somewhat dull.
LONDON, May 5.â The fall of the
curtain on Arthur -Law's new comedy,
"The Bride and Bridegroom," at the
New Theater to-night was the signal
for the noisest scene witnessed in a
London theater in many years. A storm
of "boos" and'hostile remarks from the
gallery brought Sir Charles "Wyndham
to the footlights, prepared, he said,
after several ineffectual attempts to
gain a hearing, "to face the music."
There were cheers from the boxes,
stalls and dress circle, followed by re
newed "boos" elsewhere and shouts of
"We all know you hate the gallery,"
etc. . *
Finally Sir Charles pointed his finger
angrily at the gallery and called the
police to remove the offenders. Some of
the noisiest were ejected, but this did
not abate the demonstration and Sir
Charles remained on the stage, pale but
undaunted. After repeatedly calling for
fair play, he announced his determina
tion to in the future protect his audi
ences from such organized disturb
ances. .
She says her application to the hos
pital for shelter is one of the ways to
draw public attention to her grievance*.
She Intends to remain n lodcer until
the authorities look into her case.
She tells a seemingly straight story I
regarding her life, marriasre. divorce >
proceedings, the death of her husband j
and the Probate Court proceedings, i
The hope of fabulous wealth, the story !
of the alleged miscarriage of justice !
and belief In a scheme to deprive her â¢
of that which rightly belongs to her !
may indicate Insanity. ;
Mrs. Weiler asserts that she was mar
ried to the late Richard Weiler in the
year 1S98 and after one year of con- I
tlnuous unpleasantness was separated j
from him. She says that proceedings t
for a divorce were brought by him, but |
that the decree never was granted. ,
Weiler died in 1900, leaving a holo- j
graphic will in which he bequeathed to j
his son, Leopold Weiler, by a former j
marriage, then residing In Paris, his j
life policy for J10C0 in the Independent j
Order of Foresters and to -his daush- j
ter, Mrs. Blanche Wilson, residing in
Pasadena, all his personal effects, with
instructions that certain articles should ,
be given to a woman named E.- Mea |
Wise, who had befriended him. This â¢
will was offered for probate in Judse
Troutt's department of the Superior
Court on the 6th of August, 1901, and
upon that date letters of administra
tion were issued to the woman who
now claims to be his wife. The next
proceedings had, according to the rec
ords In the County Clerk's office, show
that on the 30th of the same month At
torney W. J. Tuska filed a document as !
amicus ruriae, setting forth that the !
will filed was not the last will of the !
deceased.
This is all that appears on record
touching the disposition of the estate. '
Now this strange woman comes be- I
fore the public in the capacity of a {
pauper seeking a place to sleep, claim- j
Ing that if she had not been cheated byj
designing persons sÂ«e would be worth {
hundreds of thousands of dollars, as [
her deceased husband held a block of |
Panama canal stock, besides several ;
shares of railroad and steamship stock,
all or either of which would, had she
been able to secure them, place her in j
opulence.
Martha Grundies Weiler, whose late
husband was at one time a teacher of
modern languages at the University of
California, has sought shelter for the
last three nights at the Central Emer
gency Hospital, saying that she has
been unjustly duped out of thousands
of dollars and that her case Is one that
the public officials snould Investigate.

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, May 5.â In spite of favorable
weather In the Southwest a bullish feeling per
vaded the wheat pit at the opening. Initial
sales were made at a trifle lower price than
yesterday's close. Early sentiment was largely
domlnettd by the Illinois crop report which
v/as quite bullish in character Shorts were
especially B0o d buyers of May. Offerings of
all deliveries were light, the result being a
steady advance in prices. Toward the middle
of the. session operators received fresh inspira
tion from a report of an expert, who claimed
that the wheat crop of eight States east of the
Rocky Mountains would be decreased U0 OuO 000
bushels from that of a year asro. There was
also a very bullish report from Oklahoma !r
regard to the condition of the crop In that
section. Heavy buying of July continued
throughout the greater part of the session
Late in the day there was considerable profit
taking, which caused some reaction from the
high point, but the market closed strong Final
figures on July were S5%c after the price had
reached 854%85%c.
An improved demand and continued small re
ceipts were responsible for a firm tone in
corn to-day. July closed at '484@4S%c, Uc
higher. ;
Oats duled firm in sympathy with other
grains. The market closed eteady a shade
higher, with July at 39c.
Provisions were strong. There was a better
outside -demand and packers also were liberal
buyers. Thtr market closed firm, with July
pork up 74c. lard unchanged and ribs 24c
higher.

crop reporting been so small. The yield will
average about three-quarters of a crop, the
deficiency being due to poor growth, drowning
out. ' etc. Jones, the statistician, says of the

Trade In the Citrus Fruit â¢ market was of
small volume, as buyers were confining their
attention chiefly to Berries. The market, how
ever, had a better tone, as fresh receipts were
light and stocks of low grade fruit were less
liberal than previously. The trade was buy-
Ing on size rather than on quality and desira
ble sizes of all grades commanded a prem
ium. The managers of the auction company
announced that only three ears were in sight
for to-day's sale. Cuban Pineapples were of
fering again. Ten erates came in and sold
at $2 5CÂ©4 per^ dozen, as to size. Â¦ There was

mostly poor and sold from $1 25@1 75 per
drawer, as to quality. Strawberries were easier
under Increased receipts. Attractive lots of
Longworths met with prompt eale at full fig
ures, but the quotations had a wider range,
as there**was a considerable quantity of poor
stock received. Occasional lots of the large
varieties sold in a peddling way at $6 per
chest, but there were not enoush sales at that
figure to warrant such a quotation. Receipts
were 107 chests of Longworths and 213 chests
and 6 cratea of the large varieties. The

ThÂ» pa-Â«t week has been too cool for rapid

Â¦"frort* occurred Monday morning in Douglas.
Â¦Jacksoa' and Josephine counties, and a hard
" frost was reported in Umatllla County and a
'â¢few other localities Saturday morning. These
â¢ Tj-om*. together with those of the previous
â¢Â¦Â»Â«eek have done some damage to fruit, but
\jtj*t how much can not yet be ascertained.
: .. !Â« is .believed that cherries and Italian prunes
* .r,ave suffered the most, and that peachK.
Â¦ - : I^iir*. strawberries, petite prunes and arpies
have Kenerally escaped injury.
The s-eil is in excellent condition for plow
fr.g and this work haÂ» proceeded rapidly. Fall
â¢â¢wheat, barley and oaU continued to make
â¢ good Â«dvanc*ment and spring grain is coming
' -up to good stands. Hot* are well up on the
Swine, and their cultivation iÂ« being pushed
â¢jbaxlv planted gardens aj-e coming up nicely.
: aV.d the soil is being prepared for late garden

FAVORS GRANTING MANY
SPUR TRACK PRIVILEGES
When., the statement was made that
the Exempts, since the days of organ
ization, had disbursed $400,000 in benev
olence, Â¦ namely in caring for the sick,
burying the dead and looking after the
welfare of "widows" and orphans, and
that '.now the charitable fund t which
was never used for any other purpose
has dwindled to just a little less than
$1000 without any prospect of replen
ishing, the - same, Rabbi Voorsanger
arose and said: '
While listening: to this statement I made a
hurried calculation. The life of this organiza
tion is limited, and it Is fair to presume that be
fore ten years have passed away some .one,
as . in the army of the great Napoleon when the
name of a distinguished soldier was called,
stepped to the- front, samted and exclaimed.
"Fell on the fleld of honor." will step to the
front as the ' name 'of thÂ« â¢ last . exempt shall
have been called, and win use the words
quoted. With less than $1000 in your treasury
you cannot' continue in the charitable work
for ten years, and I suggest. that your asso
ciation ask a committee of prominent citizens
to take steps to provide some method to raise
$3000. aye $10,000. .to help the association in
the decline of life. In anything that may be
done along that line you will have my most
earnest and hearty support. The citizens of
to-day should recognize the heroic efforts of
those who in past generations made possible
the great city of San Francisco.
RABBI MAKES PLEA.
During, the course of the evening it
was made to appear that of all the very
rich citizens who have passed away,
and who in the early days had their
lives .and property saved from destruc
tion by the volunteer firemen, not one
had ever left a cent to the Exempts to
help them sustain the widows and or
phans of deceased members and keep
their indigent 1 ' fellows from applying
for a home in the Almshouse in their
declining days; that the widow of
Billy Free, he who in 1849 brought to
San Francisco the first fire engine ever
used, one that once was the property of
President Martin Van Buren, Is now
in distress . and had applied to the
Exempts for aid, also that the widow
of Jerome â¢ Rice, at one time a very
prominent. | auctioneer and an active
member of the department, one who In
his day contributed much of his wealth
to help the department along, is also In
distress, and that she has been an
applicant for aid from the Exempts,
but that owing to conditions the ap
peals of "these two notable examples
and many others could not be respond
ed to. It was also shown that two of
San Francisco's millionaires were mem
bers of the Exempts at the time of
death and that each at that time was
in arrears for dues, which have never
been said. â¢ -
Exempts, James O'Donnell. The secre
tary of the association called attention
to. the fact that in the days of af
fluence the Exempts kept In order the
firemen's, beautiful plat in Laurel Hill
Cemetery, at a cost of $300 a year, then
$150. A diminished treasury, he said,
had forced the association to abandon
the care, but. that the members of the
present paid department, movfed by a
reverence for the memories of the gal
lant firemen of old volunteer days,
generously decided for all time to con
tribute annually the amount required
to keep; the beautiful plat green. The
toastmaster -gave an interesting ac
count of his .'connection with the. early
days fire department and in silence all
drank the' toast, "The memory of those
who have answered the last roll call."
HEROES ARE FORGOTTEX.
In response to his calls there- were
addresses by ex-Judge Ferral, Rabbi
Jacob ' Voorsahger, Fire Commissioner
Parry, John Rlley, superintendent of
the corporation yard, representing the
present Fire Department officers; Dis
trict Attorney L.F. Byington, Super
visor Booth. Treasurer J:E. McDougald,
Ernest C. Stock, -M..- Baker of the vet
erans of the. paid department, Richard
Cox, Philip Figel, representing the Sons
of Exempts, and the patriarch of the
That rapidly \ diminishing and almost
obsolete band of valiant men, heroei
of the early days of San Francisco; the
Exempt Fire Association of the Vol
unteer Department, had a reunion last
Wednesday night in the house of the
Exempts on Brenham place, in cele
bration of the fifty-fourth anniversary
of the organization of the department.
This old organization, which at the
time the partly paid fire, department
succeeded the volunteers, numbered
more than twelve hundred, has now
vanished to 212, and less than fifty of
the pioneer firefighters, white haired
and in the sere and yellow. leaf of life,
were . present to take part In the cele
bration. The only comparatively
young ones present were a few that
served as torch and hose boys of the
old organization.' There were also pres
ent by invitation a number of the city
officials, Rabbi â¢ Woorsanger and ex-
Judge Robert Ferral.
A supper gotten up by the members
at their individual expense, was par
taken of, and, while it was enjoyable,
there was a certain amount of sadness,
for the invitations read: ."Be sure to be
with us, for this may, be tb^ last fes
tivity â¢ that will be . given by . the Ex
empts." -yÂ£z
Henry D. Hudson, president of the
association, .whp. came to v this city in
1849, who marched with the firemen on
the occasion of the celebration of the
admission of California into the Union,
in 1850, and who marched with the Ex
empts at the semi-centennial In 1900,
the only fireman who took part in the
two processions, .jvas the toastmaster.
JIAXY ADDRESSES.
Â« The contractors were notified of the
complaint of the Health Board that
the sweeping of streets is carried on
in a negligent and unsanitary manner.
Written consents for using the outer
edge of the sidewalks at j POwell and
Eddy streets . for free public flower
markets were filed, but the board
postponed action on applications for
permits until next Wednesday.
Mrs. Sorbier of the Outdoor League
appeared before the board and request
ed that signs be placed on lamp posts
reading: "Do Not Expectorate on the
Sidewalks," as is done in New York.
The board referred Mrs.' Sorbier to the
Supervisors to provide the necessary
funds to put up the signs on - 5000
lampposts.
BAD STREET SWEEPING.
The board referred to the City At
torney for an opinion on the matter at
preparing an assessment of benefits
and damages accruing from the change
of grade on Polk and Chestnut streets.
Claims for damages to the amount of
$80,000 have been filed, but some prop
erty owners who will be damaged have
not filed claims. The cost of regrad
ing the streets affected will exceed one
half the value of the property and will
result in collecting from some, prop
erty owners a large. amount of money
and paying it to others who would be
affected by the changes without ac
tually making the change.
The Bureau of Engineering was di
rected to estimate the cost of filling
in the morass on Array, Twenty-sixth
and Alabama streets and San Bruno
road.
No permit has been sought by the
corporation from the Sutro estate to
use the lands near Forty-eighth ave
nue so as to secure entrance into its
terminal station, near the Sutro
baths. The protest continues:
"The Sutro estate would be seriously
prejudiced by the granting ~of such
permission on the part of the Board
of Works and it would be illegal and
annulled by the courts."
Emma L. Merritt, as the executrix
of the will. of the late Adolph Sutro,
filed a protest against the granting- of
the petition of the United Railroads
to electrize its California steam road.
The protest states that the Sutra es
tate is the owner of certain private
lands from Thirty-second avenue to
the Cliff House over which the road
will run. The grant to. use the right
of way was made on condition that a
double track road should be operated
thereon, whereas the United Railroads
proposes to build a single track road
only.
XO-PER3IIT SOUGHT.
"The junk is not worth $400 to any
body," said Martin, "and it would.be
an imposition on me to compel me to
pay the amount which I bid. I am not
a professional second-hand dealer and
a job was put up on me by others,, who,
in the turmoil of the sale, would have
repudiated their own bids. I want to
be released from the obligation and
also want my deposit returned, to me."
The Board of Works held that it had
not the power to return the deposit,
but agreed to refer the matter to the
Board of Supervisors, to whom Mar
tin will send a petition.
Darby Martin, the successful bidder
on a lot of old. Junk belonging to the
city, appeared before the Board of Pub
lic Works yesterday and petitioned for
the return of $100 which he had de
posited on his bid of $1730 for the ma
terial. Martin alleged that he had been
forced into making such a | high bid
by rival second-hand dealers who "had
raised his bids, but had no intention of
standing by them had they been ac
cepted.
The board has prepared the plan for
the examination for positions as teach
ers to be held June 11. 1 The plan is al
most identical with the one of two
years ago. It goes more into details,
however, and I provides for a morning
and afternoon session instead of a con
tinuous day session. ,
The demands for supplies and re
pairs in the School -Department for

ment. The board immediately appoint
