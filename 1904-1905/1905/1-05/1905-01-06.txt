PARIS, Jan. s.âThe St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Paris edition of the New York Herald telegraphs that
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's flagship, the battleship Kniaz
Suvaroff, has struck a rock and foundered.
MAKES DENIAL OF THE REPORT
ST. PETERSBURG. .lan. 6 (By Associated Press).âReports that Vice
Admiarl Rojcstvensky's flagship, the battleship Kniaz Souvaroff:
struck a rock and sunk are unfounded. ' nas
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 6.âThe
latest report from Vice Admiral Rojes-
Ventsky's squadron was contained in
a dispatch dated Tamatave, island of
Madagascar, January 2. in which It was
â¢tated that the vice admiral's division
Â«f the Russian second Pacific squad
ron, consisting of five battleships, three
cruisers, two transports and a hospi
tal Ehip. had anchored on that day in
the roadstead of Sainte Marie, an island
Â©n the east coast.
The Kniaz Suvaroff, flagship of the j
second Pacific squadron, was a battle- j
â hip of 13,516 tons, with a nominal |
speed of eighteen knots. She was
launched only in 1901 and was one of j
newest four battleships of Russia, all j
of the same class, the others being the j
Alexander the Third, the Borodino and !
the Orel, with which it was hoped Ad- I
miral Rojestvensky might be able to I
cope with the four remaining Jaratte- i
ships of Japan. The Kniaz Suvaroff
tvas armed with four 12-inch guns and
twi'ive 6-inch guns and for protection
against torpedoes had four inches of
Admiral Sinovf Petrovioh Rojest
vensky. whose flag was flying on the
Kniaz Suvaroff. was born 56 year* ago
and received his early naval training
In the Russian Corps of Marine Cadets
and in the Marine Academy, tte left
the latter institution in 1876, in time to i
take part in the Russo-Turkieh war. In
the following year he earned the fourth
class of the Order of gt. George for his
gallant attack with the Vesta on a
Turkish warship in the Black Sea. He
became n second-class raptain in 1885
and up to 1891 commanded a succession
of warships, among them the Vladimir,
the Monomach and the Pervenez. In
3896 he was promoted to rear admiral.
He 1 commanded the revolutionary
pquadron in the Baltic during the ma
neuvers carried out in the presence of
the German Emperor in 1902 and on
that occasion received the thanks of I
the Czar and was attached to the im
perial suite. Last year he was ap
pointed alternate to the chief of the
admiralty staff.
It was definitely announced yester
day that because of the fall of Port
Arthur orders would be sent to the
Baltic fleet immediately for its recall
to homp waters. The intention of the
Government is to hold the fleet here
until It has been brought up to its full
strength by the addition of vessels now
undergoing repairs or in process of con
struction.
COURT-MARTIAL FOR STOESSEL.
Announcement Arouses Indignation of
Russian Populace.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. s.âFew
incidents of the whole war have
aroused more bitter criticism than
the blunt announcement, officially is
sued by the General Staff, that Gen
eral Stoessel will have to come home
and stand court-martial for surrend
ering the fortress of Port Arthur.
While this is an ancient regulation
and quite according to law, it is bit
terly resented on all sides that such
an announcement should have been
gratuitously made in the same bul
letin containing General Stoessel's ap
peal to the Emperor for "lenient
judgment on a garrison reduced to
shadows, who have done all that was
possible for human beings to uphold
the honor of Russia in the face of her
enemies." The Novoe Vremya. despite
the example made by the suspension
of the Rush yesterday, says:
By all means let us have a court-martial
â¢s>d make it. if possible, severe. The cruel
.Judge will, perhaps, deal leniently with those
who have *iven their blood and lives for their
country. Perhaps, also, the .court will deter
mine why a fortress known to be threatened
with blockade is not supplied with necessary
food and munitiona to enable It to hold out.
Perhaps such a court will bring- to light many
dark, hidden things and expose the creeping,
underground enemies of Russia who are In
finitely more dangerous to the nation than
those v.-ho fight in the open.
There is no definite information
here regarding General Stoessel's con
dition, but it has been public gossip
for some time that he is suffering
from cancer.

CHEFU, Jan. s.âThe statement in
tlie censored dispatches from corre
spondents with' General Nogi's army
that the Japanese lost only 50,000 men i
in taking the fortress is declared to be
absurd by Russian naval officers here.
Their lowest estimate, based both on
personal observation and on stories
told by prisoners, places the Japanese
loss at 80,000. i
Advices from Japanese sources say i
that the condition of Port Arthur is 1

General Stoessel are rapidly system- ]
atizing affairs there. General Nogi la "

RELIEF SHIP STOPPED.
I Japanese Turn Back British Cruiser
Carrying Supplies.
WEIHAIWEI, Jan. 5.-The British
| cruiser Andromeda, which sailed from
> here yesterday for Port Arthur with
| hospital stores and surgeons to assist
; the sick and wounded, returned here
I to-day, not having been allowed to
j make a landing at Port Arthur. The
cruiser proceeded to a small bay ten
miles north of Port Arthur, where she
was met by some Japanese. The latter
refused all assistance or stores of any
kind and declined to allow the- ship*s
officers 10 approach closer, the reason
given being the presence of unlocated
mines.
i'HEFU, Jan. s.âJapanese Consul
Mizouno to-night notified Russian Con
sul Tiedemann that the first of the 1000
I Russian non-combatants at Port Ar
| thur who are to come to Chefu will ar
rive on Friday. It will be some time
before the entire 1000 reach here, owing
to a shortage of transportation facili
ties.
The authorities at Tokio having re
fused a proposition made by the Rus
sian Minister in Peking, Paul Lessar,
to send a ship laden with medical sup
plies and food for the invalids, it has
been suggested that this ship be divert -
jpd to ('hefu for the benefit of the non-
I combatants.
Consul Mizouno says that the refusal
of the Japanese to allow either the An
dromeda or the ship'proposed by Min
ister Lessar to visit Port Arthur is in
pursuance of a strict policy not to al
low any foreign vessel to approach the
harbor. It is understood, however, that
the refusal of the Japanese to accept
the aid tendered by the Andromeda
was an error born of their desire to
show to the world that Japanese hu
manitarianism was fully equal to the
occasion.
Sympathy for the sick and wounded
Russians at Port Arthur is widespread,
but the suggestion that they be cared
for at Chefu, Tientsin, Shanghai, Wei
haiwei and Tsingtau has led to an in
quiry which developed the fact that the
combined facilities of the places named
are equal to harboring only a very
small percentage of them. The general
opinion here Is that the great majority
of the sick and wounded will be com
pelled to remain at Port Arthur until
they are sufficiently convalescent to
return to Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. s.âThe an
nouncement from Weihaiwei that the
Japanese turned back the British
cruiser Andromeda, having on board
doctors, nurses and hospital stores, so
much needed at Port Arthur, arouses
irfdignation here, and goes far to de
stroy the good Impression created by
the attitude of the victors. If the Jap
anese were unable to allow the Andro
meda to enter Port Arthur, it is not un
derstood here why they did not permit
the Andromeda to land her supplies at
Port Dalny unless the Japanese did not
care to reveal the condition of the be
sieging army.
VICTORIA, B. C. Jan. s.âThe
steamer Kanagawa, which took a car
go of submarine boats to Japan on her
last trip from Seattle, arrived to-day
from the Orient. The torpedo-boats
were shipped in Sections. Officers of !
the Kanagawa report that the Jap- |
anese Government now has about
; thirty submarine vessels, many of ]
which are ready for service. Others
are being put together at Kure.
BRITONS LOSE CHINA'S FAVOR.
â¢ i
SHANGHAI. Jan. s.âThe North
China Daily News reports that Chou
Fu, the new Viceroy of Nanking, has
appointed a German named Basse as
manager of the Chinese arsenal at |
Shanghai. This probably means, the i
paper says, the ousting of the present
British manager of the Ordnance De
partment and the bringing of the Chi
nese arsenals at Chinanfu, Hankow
Shanghai. Nanking and Tientsin into
German hands.

peatedly reported that the Gregory

THE San Francisco CALL
Bard's, Managers Expect to Bring
About a Conference When He Ar
rives From Nation's Capital.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. s.âThe dullest
Senatorial campaign ever conducted in
Sacramento is just beginning to give
some signs of animation. At last the
members of the Legislature from the
south comprehend that if they do not
speedily adjust their differences of
opinion and consolidate their entire
forces in the support of one candidate
the legislators from Central and North
ern California will hand the toga to
George A. Knight or Arthur G. Fisk.
There are inaications to-night that
measures wiil be taken soon to bring
together all the conflicting forces in
the ranks of southern Republicans. Ac
cessions to the Knight column have a
tendency to accelerate the negotiations.
There is elation at Knight s iuad
quarters and depression in another
camp over a report, which is generally
accepted as authentic, that James Gil
lis, State Librarian, has captured and
transferred to Knight the Sacramento
delegation of three membersâSenator
James >A. McKee and Assemblymen
Charles O. Busick and Frank J.
O'Brien. Oldtiir.ers assert that a Sac
ramento delegation can see a railroad
programme earlier, catch it quicker
and hold it longer than can any other
aggregation of statesmen in the land.
Hence some special significance is at
tached to the attitude t>f the Sacra
mento representatives. All this leadd
to a surmise that the gilded brick which
Herrin has molded will bear the initials
"F. P. F.\" instead of "G. A. K."
The Flint boomers do not conteniDlate
the candidacy of Knight with serene
complaisance. They complain with
some degree of justice that their candi
date has been hammered because Jere
Burke, John Mackenzie and Walter
Parker of the Southern Pacific political
staff are espousing Flint's candidacy,
and after the hammering another aspi
rant for the Senatorial toga succeeds to
the favor of the corporation. Judge
Dibble, who is here as George Knight's
chief of staff, insists that Herrin is
keeping "hands off" as between Flint
and Knight, but the railroad blanket of
neutrality does not cover Senator Bard,
who is exposed to the merciless ele
ments of corporate disfavor. Bard has
done something or there is apprehen
sion that he will do something to incur
the displeasure of Herrin. Lynch.
Burke,' Parker and Mackenzie are ex
pected to hammer Bard until he is
driven from the field and then Herrin
will step in and say to the Republicans
of the Legislature, "My hands are off.
You can give the Senatorshio to mv
candidate of the north or my candi
date of the south."
When Senator Bard arrives in Sacra
mento steps will be taken to bring
about a conference of the leading Re
publicans of Southern California.
Frank P. Flint openly asserts that he
would sacrifice his own personal ambi
tions rather than that the south should
lose the Senator. Henry T. Oxnard
stands ready to cast the weight of his
influence for harmony on the Senator
ship in the south. It is said that Sen
ator Bard, whose ambitions are not in
tense, will be as magnanimous as his
competitors are. The importance of
harmony and a consolidation of all the
Republican forces in the south were
topics dwelt upon at a conference be
tween Dr. Rowell and Oxnard this aft
ernoon.
Senator Will Visit Sacramento and
Meet Members of Legislature.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 6. â United
States Senator Bard Is supposed to be
on his way to Sacramento to enter in
person the Senatorial fight. He tele
graphed on Wednesday that he would
stavt to-night, and if he did so he may
be expected in the California Capitol on
Monday next. The Senator's managers
felt that his interests demanded his
presence here and that he owed it to
those legislators who had never seen
him, but who wanted to vote for him
jan opportunity to size him up before
â¢ they did so. The managers say they
[ are not in any way afraid of the result
of the "sizing up." They telegraphed
1 him on Tuesday that, in their opinion
|he should be here. The message being
,of a most urgent nature and calling for
an immediate reply. Bard's managers
waited for an answer, but yesterday
! went by and none came. To-day was
I nearly done, and still there was no
! word. The Bard people wondered what
was wrong. This evening State Senator
| Rowell of the Bard headquarters hap-
I pened to be in a hotel other than the
i one where the headquarters ,are and
looked over tha telegrams In the "R"
box, thinking one intended for him
might have been sent to that house by
mistake. There he found a telegram
from Senator Bard opened. it had
come yesterday morning and had lain
in the box nearly two days after being
read by some one it was not intended
for.
Senator Bard announced in the tele
gram that he would start for Califor
nia Thursday night unless the irriga
tion and statehood legislation, which
was then occupying his attention, de
tained him too long.
The opening of the telegram and the
failure to put it in the hands of Rowell
earlier are in keeping with some other

Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.âRailroad rate
legislation is dead, so far as the pres
ent' session of Congress is concerned.
It was said by leaders in both branches
to-day that nothing could be done, no
matter how much President Roosevelt
may desire it or how much he may
urge It.
The collapse of the campaign for gov
ernment supervision of railroad rates
takes away from the present session
I the only real live question which prom-
I ised at one time to keep Congress agi
tated. When the President gave up all
j hope of having something done in the
â  line of tariff revision, he had reason to
believe something might be accom
plished in railroad legislation. But this
has now gone the way of tariff revi
{ sion.
! The present situation has been
! brought about by an utter failure to
I come to an agreement on the form of
legislation. The belief was expressed.
! both in administration circles and in
I Congress, that something should be
done at once to remedy the evil point
ed out in the President's message, but
only on this point was there any agree
ment. When it came to methods, not to
say the phraseology of the bill to be
presented, there were almost as many
different views as members of the
Cabinet and leaders in Congress.
Senator Elkins had another confer
ence with the President to-day, but on
coming from the White House he
would not say that there was any
chance for action on a railroad bill in
the near future.
ANUARY 6, 1905.
THE River Improvement and Drainage Association of California reached a unanimous agreement yes
terday regarding a plan for the improvement of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and the
reclamation of i ,000,000 acres of land that annually are menaced by floods. It was estimated that
when reclamation is permanently affected the value of $ 100,000,000 will be added to the taxable property
ot the State. The report of a board of engineers was accepted as a working basis.

OF JUPITER
Important Discov
â¢ cry at Lick Ob
servatory.
Special Dispatch to Tbe CalL
SAN JOSE, Jan, s.âLick Observatory
has discovered a sixth satellite of Jupi- ]
ter. The discovery was made by Pro
fessor Perrine by means of the Cross
ley reflector and is the result of a sys
tematic search begun early in De
cember.
On photographs taken at that time
of the region west of Jupiter the image
of an unknown body, which changed
its position nightly, was found by Per
rine. Since then investigations have
been carried on to decide whether it
was a satellite or one of the asteroids.
During the present week observations
have been made which leave no doubt
that the body is revolving around the
planet. Last night it was forty-five
minutes of an arc due west of the
planet and the distance is now increas
ing slowly.
The satellite is of the fourteenth
magnitude, and to detect it requires a
telescope as large as ten or twelve
inches in diameter.
The orbit of this moon cannot be de
termined until observations extending
over many weeks have been obtained.
However, Professor Perrine says it is
five or six times farther from the
planet than is the outermost of the five
satellites previously known, and it is
possible that the period of revolution
around the planet is from six to eight
months.
The observations that led to the dis
covery of the satellite were the first
made with the Crossley reflector since
it has been provided with a modern
mounting. This Is the second satellite
discovered at Lick Observatory.
Jupiter's four very bright satellites
were discovered by Galileo in 1610, but

BEEF TRUST
Personal Inquiry to

Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
CHICAGO. Jan. s.âFollowing the
charges made by Attorney General
Moody that the packers were in a con
spiracy to control the market of the na
tion for fresh meat, it was learned to
day that Secretary Garfield of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor is
coming to Chicago to begin an investi
gation in person. The packers are much
agitated over the news.
It is said Secretary Garfield is* anx
ious to have the Federal courts nass
on the question of whether he can com
pel the packers to produce their books
and submit to* direct examination on
the witness stand as to the methods
they follow in business.
At the annual meeting of the stock
holders of Swift & Co. to-day Presi
dent Lewis F. Swift said:
"It is needless for me to say to those
present, who are more or less familiar
with the facts, that the reports In cir
culation about the 'beef trust' are
without foundation. There is absolute
ly no conspiracy or combination to con-
S trol either the purchase of livestock or
the sale of meats or packing-house
products. On the other hand, the Dack
lng industry is subject to the severest
kind of competition, both in buying
and selling, and the per cent of profit
on sales in the packing Industry is less
than in other lines of business lust
now."
It was not until nearly 300 years after
ward, on September 9. 1892, that Pro
fessor Â£. E. Barnard discovered the
fifth with the Lick telescope. The fifth
and sixth satellites are of approximate
ly the same brightness.

HARMONY IN WORK
Unanimous Action
Is Taken After
Discussion.
The River Improvement and Drain
age Association of California, at a
meeting held yesterday at the Palace
Hotel, unanimously adopted a report of
its executive committee, in which a
plan was embodied for carrying out the
great work which is advocated by the
association. It was set forth in the re
port that 1,000,000 acres of land now
subject to ravages by floods in the val
leys' of California, by the rivers, can be
reclaimed, and that the increased value
of the land, for purposes of taxation,
will yield to the State an annual added
revenue of 1300,000. These statements
were based upon the report of a com
mission of engineers who visited the
great interior valleys and inspected the
rivers and their watersheds. The engi
neers are T. G. Dabney, Henry B. Rich
ardson, M. A. Nurse and H. M. Chit
tenden.
The report of the commission of engi
neers was before the River Improve
ment and Drainage Association in
pamphlets. One paragraph is as fol
lows:
"The direct benefits to the entire Sac
ramento Valley as the result of perfect
ing the plan of improvement in the
reclamation of about 1,000.000 acres of
extremely fertile land and placing it In
a position of assured safety from over
flow, together with direct and indirect
advantages to many associated inter
ests, must be expressed in a moneyed
valuation reaching at least $100,000,000,
which will assuredly justify the cost of
the work required to bring about these
results."
It was estimated that the works pro
posed by the board of engineers will
cost something like $24,000,000. The
works are, as planned, to consist of
channel rectification and pnlarsrement
by the point action of natural and me
chanical agencies and also the gradual
concentration and confinement of the
volume of floods of the rivers and the
lesser streams of the Sacramento Val
ley between lines of levees so located
"as to ultimately provide ample chan
nel area for transporting all the flood
volume."
In the meantime, until such channel
rectification shall have been secured,
the engineers suggest that "relief will
be afforded the levees by introduction
of escapement weirs to temporary by
pass channels for conducting the floods
through the basins."
Concerning the engineering plans
there was no discussion at yesterday's
meeting. Some talk took place regard
ing the means proposed by the execu
tive committee of the River Improve
ment and Drainage Association to se
cure funds to carry on the great works.
COMMITTEE SUGGESTIONS.
The executive committee suggested,
briefly expressed, that the lands within
the drainage district should pay one
third of the cost, the State to pay one
third and the Federal Government one
third, but also recommended that a
method of officially determining the
cost to be borne by the different inter
ests should be provided. Nothing can
be done, so it was set forth, to affect
the regimen of the rivers without the
consent of the Federal Government,
and Joint action of the State and Fed
eral Governments should be secured as
the first step. Therefore it was pro
posed by the executive committee that
the Legislature should be asked to rec
ommend to Congress the adoption of a
joint resolution authorizing the ap
pointment of a board of three engineers
of the United States army to examine
and report upon the report recently
submitted by the board of engineers
that viewed the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers.
A minority report was filed by Charles
Wesley Reed and E. A. Walcott. Reed
made the principal speech in support of
the contention in the minority report
that the way to proceed directly was
to have a constitutional amendment
submitted to the people in regard to the
action that will be necessary to raise
the State's share of the more than $20,
--000,000 to be expended. This caused
some rather warm discussion, but in
the end, after the minority report had
been rejected, Reed and Walcott voted
to make the action of the association

PORT ARTHUR. Jan. 6. âA meeting
between General Stoessel and General
Nogi took place to-day at Shulshi vil
lage. Noon was the hour fixed for the
meeting, but owing to a misunder
standing of the time General Stoessel
arrived at 10:30 o'clock and was re

sel remained at Plumtree cottage until j
II o'clock, when General Nogi arrived j
with his staff. The two generals met in :
a room of the cottage and after an ex- â

APPORTION THE BURDEN
PARTIES CONCERNED
ARE TO CARRY.
SHARE OF EACH INTEREST IS ONE THIRD
Commissions Are Provided For to Con
duct Operations on Streams in Detail.
The report of the executive commit
tee of the River Improvement and
Drainage Association of California is
given in full herewith. The principal
points contained in it refer to the cost
and apportionment of . the work to be
performed and contain a declaration
that there can be no question that the
burden must be divided between the
Federal and State governments and the
land owners; sots up that Fed
eral Government belongs the "preserva
tion of the navigability of the rivers
and the restoration of channels and to
prevent the escape of water from the
rivers; estimates the gain that will
accrue to the State under a great
reclamation plan: recommends that
one-third of the expense shall be car
ried by the Federal Government, one
third by the State and one-third by
the property owners; adopts the recom
mendation of the engineers as to the
basis of river improvement; provides
for a drainage district to include with
in its'boundaries the territory shown
in the map submitted by the engineers;
also provides for a board of river con
trol of two members to have charge
of the construction of levees and chan
nels In connection with the disposition
of flood waters and their care; also a
drainage commission of eleven mem
bers who will appoint assessors
to assess upon the land with
in the drainage district charges
proportioned to benefits; asserts
that it is of great importance that
the entire funds needed shall be guar
anteed from the start; recommends
that any appropriation of money by the
State shall be conditional upon appro
priation by the Federal Government;
urges immediate action upon the ex
ecutive committee.
The text in full of the executive com
mittee's report is as follows:
Your executive committee, appointed at the
oioee of the convention held In San fÂ«nclac?.
May 28 and 24 last, begs to submit the fol
lO furt'herance n ln of the resolutions passed at
the convention three eminent engineers resid
ing out ot the State of California were ap
pointed to submit n comprehensive plan of
river Improvement, the State engineer co-op
erating with theÂ»c three gentlemen.
The State Is to be congratulated on the
character of the cm mission of engineers thus
organized, and your commute* does not hesi
tate to express its fullest belief that the re
port presented by this commission cannot fail,
if carried out in its essential features, to solve
effectively ana permanently the problem or
river reform.
In anticipation of this report your commit
tee has spent much time and effort in the en
deavor to arrive at an equitable and Just ap
portionment of the estimated cost of the
work. '
That the burden roust be divided between
the Federal and State governments and the
landowners there can be no Question.
The navlgatton pf the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers is a matter purely within the
jurisdiction of the Federal Government, and its
I protection is a burden that the Federal Gov-
I rnment has in ail cases assumed. At an early
period the Sacramento River was susceptible
of ravtgatlon throughout it? entire course in
the Sacramento Valley and the Feather River
was navigated as far as Marysvllle. From
various or.uses the channels of these rivers
have been obstructed and filled with sediment.
Both the navigability and the flood carrying
capacity ot the rivers have been seriously im
paired This condition has arisen from the
failure of the State and Federal governments
ito protect and maintain the channels, and in
iustlee to the State of California the Federal
Government should contribute to the Joint
fund it is hoped to create, the object of which
will be not only to lestore the channels to the
\ condition they were In before impairment, but
I add to their capacity to such an extent as
1 shall justify reclamation of the lands through
which thoy flow.
To do this, and maintain them in future,
the report of the engineers shows plainly the
work necessary to be done. It will be neces
sary to prevent the escape of water from the
river and to concentrate the flow within the
channels in order to provide sufficient current
Ito remove the sediment which has already
: accumulated and to prevent deposit in the
| future.
| There, ia an additional burden that should
j be borne by the Federal Government, and that
jlÂ» the correction and improvement of the
I channels, so aa to make them more servlce-
J able for navigation.
Commerce i.Â« rapidly increasing and the
I valleys are becoming more productive, and
I this calls for some consideration on the part
lot the Federal Government to make provi
sions for moving the product. The burden of so
i doing is one that the Federal Government has
; assumed throughout the United States, and
we can see no reason why it should not be
adopted on the Pacific Coast.
STATE IS INTERESTED.
The State is interested In this work for
j many reasons. The lands already partially
I reclaimed within the valleys will "be saved
I from recurrence of the disastrous flood? that
i have heretofore periodically devastated them,
j A large area of land that is now useless and
! unoccupied will be placed In a condition to
j make its reclamation possible, will afford
homes for increasing population and add to
the products of the State to an enormous ex
: tent. It is estimated that 1.000.000 acres ot
the richest land in California can be safely
ana permanently reclaimed and an average of
; WW- an acre added to its value. The reeiama-
I tion of some of this land has already bÂ»en
' attempted, but part of its has been allowed
'to lapse entirely and more of it la subjected
|to occasional overflow and an insignificant
I proportion only can be looked upon aa being
I permanertly reclaimed. â¢
The increased value of the land for pur
i poses of taxation at the present rate of tax
, ation on the land alone would add to the
revenue of the State- at least $250,000 annually,
iln addition to this opening of the land to
settlement and cultivation will necessarily re
quire the erection of improvements upon the
land and the acquisition of personal property
for the purpose of cultivation and manage
ment. This will easily add another $50,000 to
1 the revenues of the State, making a total of
; $;)00,000 per annum that the State will de
j rive in benefits âand this benefit will be per
petual.
Indirectly the State will gain largely from
I the progress of so Important a work. The
1 entire coat of the work will be spent right
here in California; employment will be found
for ft large force of men. a large fleet of
dredgers will have to be built and operated.
Vast quantities of fuel will be required for
power; freighting supplies will of iteelf be ft
.large Item. Subsequently the magnificent ter- 1
ritory developed, all susceptible of intense and
varied.cultivation, will be sending through the
channels of commerce o splendid contribution
to the product of the State.
LAND OWNERS' SHARE.
A portion of the expense should undoubtedly
Ibe paid by assessment upon the lands to be
i benefited, for the reason that they will be
enhanced In value.
A somewhat exaggerated estimate of the
probable enhancement has become current. It
is sometimes suggested that a great part of
â  tha cost of the proposed work should be borne
by the lands because of the greatly Increased
value to be given to them. Values of $100 and
$160 an acre are sometimes talked of. and it
Is forgotten that the high value of some re
claimed tracts of thia State has been reached
by added improvements of houses, barns, good
roads and tbe growth of important settlements,
with their hotels, poatofflcea, etc. Moreover
the high estimation of the value of lands la
rather an anticipation of the value It may
have when we have ft large population and
assured markets for the product of intenae
cultivation. But wÂ« think the price that Is
realized In tbe aelling of large tracts of land
cornea approximately near establishing their
value and the following statement of facta
should be considered before accepting; tha more
picturesque estimate of value:
The upper division of Roberta Island, con
tatnlnrfl 12,000 acres, was cold In farms In
1888-1889 after reclamation, at an average
price of $30 per acre. â¢
The lower division of Roberta Island, con
taining 13.000 acre*, was sold in farms la
1892-1897 after reclamation, at an average
price of $80 per acre.
Some 4000 acres of land on Grand Island
were sold in farms between the years 1890
--| 1901. after reclamation, at prices averaging $00
, per acre.
The land is undoubtedly lntrinaically worth
more than the prices detailedâthat Is to say.
It will pay Interest on higher valuations, but
the element of risk recognized is a potent fac
tor in determining Its selling value.
VALUE TO BE ADDED.
A conservative estimate of tho additional
value to be added to the lands by complete
reclamation is $50 per acre. Thia at first
would seem to be such an advantage that the
lands could well afford to bear a large pro
portion of the burden, but we must bear in
mind that this Increased valuation will not be
produced solely by the expenditure of the
money contemplated by the report of the en
gineers. When ail the work has been done, as
contemplated by the report, the lands will still
he only partially reclaimed, or to be more ex
act, this work is to-Justify the further work
necessary to reclaim the lands. There will be
an additional expense pumping plants, etc..
the entire coat of which will fall upon the land
owners.
While It |g Just that the Federal Government
should restore the original natural condition
of the channels, and that the State. In pursu
ance of iv undertaking with the Federal Gov
ernment to reclaim the awamp lands, should
supplant this with such additional work as
sliuuhl give control of flood water, still It must
be constantly borne in mind that to Create con- i
dltlons which will render possible the recla
mation of private lands by their owners at
their own expense Is all that can be asked of
either, and everything for direct land reclama
tion must be eliminated from the estimates
before determining the share of the burden the
State and Federal governments shall be asked
to bear.
, PLAN OF ORGANIZATION.
For the execution of the work and the ad
ministration of the funds, your committee rec
ommends the tullowlng plan of organization:
That the recommendations of the engineers
appointed by the State bu adopted as the basis
of river Improvement.
That a drainage district be formed at the
prevent session nf the Legislature to include
within its boundaries the territory shown by
the map of the commission of engineers.
That a board oi rtVSf control ite created,
consisting of two mrniliers, one selected by the
State of California and one by the Drainage
Commission hereinafter mentioned. The board
of river control to have charge of the con
struction of such leveen and channels as are
intended to do duty in disposing of flood wat
ers, and thereafter control the said levees and
channels, such hoard of river control to act In
conjunction with such board or officer aa may
be hereafter designated by the Federal Gov
ernment.
The member of said board of river control
selected by the State to be a civil engineer.
A drainage commission for the district con
sisting of eleven members shall be elected by
the land owners of said district: three from
Sacramento COUBty, two from San Joaquin
County, one from Placer and Yuba Jointly, one
from Glenn and Butte jointly, one from Sut
ter, one from Colusa, one from Yolo, one fr*Â»m
Solano.
TCaeh bona fide owner of lands in. the district
shall be entitled to vote In iierson or by proxy
for the election of members of tbe drainage
commission at meetings to be held at desig
nated places every four years and shall have
the right to cast one vote for each $1 worth of
real estate Owned by him or her in the dis
trict, the value thereof to be determined from
the next prcedlng assssment roll of the county,
and a majority of the votes cast at such elec
tion shall elect.
I.and belonging to the estate of any Infant
owner may be represented b' - the guardian of
the estate or such Infant, and that belonging
to the estate of any deceased owner by his
executor or administrator.
The drainage commission shall apporftt three
assessors wljo shall not be owners of or Inter
ested in land embraced In the district.
THE LAND.
The Assessors shall assess upon the land
within the district a charge proportionate to
the estimated cost of the work according to
the benefits to be derived therefrom and shall
make a list of the charges so assessed against
the land in each county separately; the As
sessors shall return said lists to the drainage
commission, which shall appoint a time and
;>lace in each county and give notice thereof
In some newspaper published in said county
for a hearing. At such hearing any landhold
er dissatisfied with the assessment may ap
pear before the ucmmlssion and file objections
thereto. '?h a commission shall take evidence.
If any is offered, and shall decide upon the
merits of the objections so made and the de
cision of the commission shall be final.
The drainage commission shall have power
to form new reclamation districts within said
drainage district and change the boundaries
of any district when necessary or desirable for
the promotion of better reclamation.
They shall have charge and control of all
matters of reclamation In said district affect-
Ini; the public safety and welfare, outside of
those placed in charge of the board of river
control, and excepting those conferred upon
the trustees of reclamation districts.
All existing reclamation districts to be con
tinued as they are now formed, until changed
by the Drainage Commission. Those now ex
isting and those hereafter created to nave
local Jurisdiction aa now provided by law,
excepting so far as such Jurisdiction may be
affected by powers conferred upon the Board
of Rtver Control and upon the Drainage Com
mission.
The i ost of constructing the works that are
to be placed in charge of the Board of River
Control to be paid as follows: One-third by
assessment upon the lands within the drainage
district: one-third by the State, and one-third
by the Federal Government.
The assessment to be placed upon the lands
to v be apportioned thereon acordlng to the bene
fits received; that is to say."work exclusively
benefiting any particular locality must be as
sessed solely upon the land situated therein.
All the money collected from assessments
upon the lands shall be deposited in the State
treasury.
NEED ENTIRE FUND.
We strongly urge that the recommendation
of the engineers that '"the entire funds for
the work should be guaranteed from the
start" is of great Importance, to prevent pos
sibility of the work being commenced and
money expended that would produce no re
sults unless the work were completed.
Aay appropriation made by the State shall
be conditional upon appropriation by the Fed
eral Government and assessment on the lands
of an additional sum sufficient' to complete
the work, and all assessments levied upon land
of the district shall be made available and
only on the condition that the State and Fed
eral governmenta shall make appropriations
sufficient, to furnish tbe additional funds to
meet the entire coat. â
While we recommend the foregoing specific
i division of the cost, we recognize that there
are too many conflicting opinions to permit
a hasty conclusion and therefore suggest a
method of officially determining the propor
tion ot coat to be borne by tbe different in
terests. â¢ â¢ . .
As the State can do absolutely nothing af
fecting the regime of the rivers without the
consent of the Federal authorities and *s. in
any event. Joint , action by the State and Fed
eral governments is essential' to the solution
of th- problem, the first step must necessarily
be" to secure auch co-operative action.
To that end we recommend that the executive
> committee be- authorised to memorialize tbe
I Legislature In the name of the association,
,to recommend to Congress the passage of a
joint resolution appointing a board consisting
of three engineers of the Cnited States army
for the purpose of making an examination
and report on the report recently submitted
by a commiaÃion of engineers appointed by
the State of California, for the improvement
of the Sacramento 'and San Joaquin rivers and
eatimating the cost of restoring and improving
the -original navigable capacity of said rivers.
Such project shall Include all necessary rec
tification, straightening, deepening and widen
ing of said stream, as well as the construction
iof any levee system or systems that may be
I required to rectify the river and provide means
â of escape of the flood wave to tidewater, hay
, Ini in view not only the interests of naviga
tion, but also those of flood control and rec
lamation.
Said board, so far as practicable, shall work
In harmony with any engineers, commissioners
or officers representing the State of California.

JENNINGS' ADDRESS.
At the opening of the proceedings
yesterday President Rufus P. Jennings
made an address. In part he said:
"It is impracticable at this time to
go into all of the details of the work !
that has been done by the commitee. j
The necessity and importance of j
prompt action, however, is realized, '
and that the comprehensive report of '
the engineers now before us should be
carried out with all possible dispatch
is evident.
"We are menaced with a constant
danger and the sooner this danger is
averted the better. The points of con
troversy that have heretofore divided
forces and probably delayed conclusive
actions are all, I hope, finally disposed
of by the report 'of the commission of
engineers. Any one who studies care
fully the argument made by these
gentlemen which they arrive at their
final conclusions cannot fall to see that
most of the remedies previously sug
gested had their measure of jnerit. I
This shows what all of us have recog- '
nized that they were the conclusions j
of thinking men who were probably
not furnished with the elaborate de
tails from which the commission of, en
gineers worked.
seemsÂ» to me good reason has !
been shown why all controversial i
points should be abandoned, and aban- j
doned forever. Never again must our ;
efforts bÂ» weakened by discussing the
several issues that have been settled by I
the report of the commission of en- j
gineers.
"There is much yet to be done. The
work has only commenced. That which i
is before us needs the help of every â¢
one, and it is believed that Californians
Will join together and carry out a plan
which i:i its benefits to the State are i
scarcely to be estimated. The ends de- j
sired, however, can only be accom
plished by concerted action, a setting j
aside of individual prejudices and even ;
personal interests. One for all and all
for one."

Proposals Are Received at Phoenix
for Supplying Reclamation Ser
vice With Fuel Oil.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. s.âBids were
opened at the headquarters of the
reclamation service here to-day for
furnishing 50,000 barrels of fuel oil
for the Roosevelt dam and they will
be referred to Washington for the
awarding. There were various propo
sitions submitted, including oil at the
supply point, or delivered at Roose
velt, at Mesa City and Globe, the near
est railroad points, and also on the
wagon haul. The lowest quotation at
the supply point was by the Union
Oil Company at 19 9-10 cents a barrel
at Bakersfleld. The lowest bid of oil
delivered at the dam was by C. R.
Eager & Co.. Los Angeles, of $3 48.
The lowest for delivery at Mesa City
by the Associated Oil Company, San
Francisco, $1 26; lowest wagon haul,
Wolf Sachs, Tempe, Ariz., $2 24%. The
cost of railroad freight to the Govern
ment if the oil Is bought in the field
apparently will be the determining
factor.

was engaged In selling hair and face
preparations, and when she left Den
ver about $300 worth of various prepa
rations were left in this city in the care
of Mrs. L. U. Jones, with whom she had
stopped. Mrs. Jones has not heard from
her and still has the goods. Mrs. Bish
op promised to return not later than
October. Her general description close
ly answers that of the victim of the
mysterious tragedy. Her hair was the
same color and her weight and age the
same.
When Mrs. Bishop came to Denver j
she said she came from San Francisco
and that her home was in California, i
She was retiring and unepmmunicative, :
and those who made her acquaintance!
learned little of her affairs. She did not
make money here, and went to Colo
rado Springs in a search for a new lo
cation.
Mrs. Jones sent a letter to Colorado
Springs several days ago addressed to
Mrs. Bishop. It was returned, the
postal authorities having been unable
to locate the woman.
While the identification of the body
found as that of Mrs. Bouton is strong, ;
there is enough doubt about it to cause 1
much anxiety among Mrs. Bishop's j
friends.

OF UNCLE SAM
MARSHALS ON GUARD
Woman's Attorney Refused
Admission to Client's Cell
Despite Furious Objections
CLEVELAND, Jan. s.âAs a result of
a dash between the Federal and coun
ty authorities that has been on since
Mrs. Cassis L. Chadwlok arrived In this
city from New York as to who had
jurisdiction over the prisoner's career
while she is in the County Jail, the
Federal authorities to-night definitely
stated that they would assume control
of the fair prisoner.
Two deputy United States Marshals
have alternated in the County Jail to
day, and to-night are guarding the way
to Mrs. Chadwick's cell. Not even her
| attorney, J. P. Dawley, was allowed to
see her to-day because he had not ob
tained permission from the Federal of
ficials. Dawley, who is a very prom
inent lawyer, asserted the prerogative
:of his calling to see his client, but a
powerful deputy marshal refused him
entrance to the women's corridor of tha
jail. Dawley was furious and said to
the marshal that if he had half as
much physical strength as he had de
termination he would throw the mar
i shal out of the window.
| The trunk belonging to Mrs. Chad
wick was opened to-day by Attorney
Louis Grossman. It contained only
j wearing apparel for Mrs. Chadwlck,
! consisting of four dresses and an en
tire suit of moleskin, the whole being
i worth. Mr. Grossman thought, perhaps
14000 or 15000.

SAYS BARD WILL NOT WIN
Assemblyman From Redlands
Explains His Position.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAJCFINTO, Jan. s.âThe first
sensation of the session same late to
night, when it was announced that
without warning or explanation
Speaker Frank C. Prescott had aban
doned the camp Of Senator Bard and
joined the forces of Frank P. Flint
in the Senatorial contest. Flint's sup
porters are elated over this acquisition
â if strength, though depression is not
j'oticeable at Bard's headquarters,
" where it is said that it was known two
â¢ v ..eks ago, when Walter Parker saw
Herrin and programmed the Speaker
ship. Prescott, however, will not have
â it that way. He strenuously denies
that he was elected under a pledge to
his constituents to support Bard first
and last, and asserts that he entered
the contest with diametrically op
posite views, based on the fact that
to develop an issue it was necessary for
him to act independently, as his Dem
ocratic opponent was an avowed Bard
supporter.
Speaker Prescott was located at the
heme of friends and readily consented
.to explain, over the telephone, his posi
tion.
V'Yes, it is true," he said, "that I have
announced myself in favor of the can
didacy of Mr. Flint. I did this, how
ever, only after a thorough study oi
the situation and mature deliberation.
I am now confident that Senator Bard
has not a ghost of a show to succeed
himself and my belief that he has been
eliminated from the race resulted in
my being in favor of Mr. Flint. I pro
ceeded Â«. n the belief that if we all get
behind Mr. Flint we can elect him. It
is necessary that Southern California
be recognized and that we elect a Sen
ator this time from our district. We
cannot re-elect Bard, so I am going to
do all I can to elect Mr. Flint. I know-
Mr. Flint very well; we have been
friends for some time and I am thor
oughly familiar with his record. Men
tally, morally and socially he is all
that could be desired and would honor
California in the Senate of the United
States."
"Were you elected by voters that
were under the impression that you
were pledged to Bard?" was asked.
"No, I was not," answered the
Speaker. "While it is true that during
the campaign the San Bernardino Sun
printed an article the headlines of
which said I was unequivocally pledged
to Bard, the article did not bear out
' this statement and explained my posi
tion correctly."
"Then you came here as a Flint man
and not as a Bard man, as was gener
ally supposed?"
"Well, hardly, yes," answered Pres
cott. "I intended to vote for Mr. Flint
from first to last, and the impression
that I have only changed now in grati
tude for the elevation to the Speaker's
chair is not correct. I am absolutely
free; no strings are upon me. My only
desire is that Southern California shall
â¢ have the Senator, and believing that

LEADERS ARE TO CONFER.
Meeting May Take Place in San Fran-
Cisco Next Saturday.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 6.âThe first
conference of leaders to bring about a
union of the Republicans of the south
may take place in San Francisco next
Saturday or It may be postponed so
as'to take place here immediately after
the arrival of Senator Bard and U. i?.
Grant. The latter, it is said, has ar
ranged to attend the meeting of the
Presidential electors hi this city next
Monday. Events may suggest the in
troduction of Grant as a candidate ac
ceptable to the several factions.
The question is asked in all camps,
"Where will the Arthur Fisk bunch go
when the break comes?" The impres
sion gains that the supporters of the
Postmaster's candidacy will be used to
advance the position of some aspirant
from the south, so that Senator Per
kins shall not be confronted by obsta
cles four years hence.
The Ruef delegation of San Fran
cisco statesmen will disintegrate at the
"proper time." Knight boomers who
are claiming the ultimate support of
the San Francisco delegation will prob
ably find that Ruef has made other ar
rangements.
The notion that President Roosevelt
is losing much needed sleep nights in
consequence of the uncertainty of the
outcome of the battle for the Senator
ship in California is becoming stale and
unprofitable. It Is known that Roose
velt has a speaking acquaintance with
several of the candidates, and It is also
known in a general way that he doesn't
care which one succeeds provided the
Legislature does not choose a man who
is tied up hard and fast to the railroad
corporations.
The peculiarity of the present contest
in Sacramento Is the eagerness of as
pirants to convince the Legislature that
the railroad is with them in the fight
for the Senatorship, and also that they
will be with the President in his fight
on the railroads.

OXNARD STILL CONFIDENT
Continued from Page 1, Column 3.
work not of a very creditable nature
that is being done against Bard. The
attempt to hold the Senator up before
legislators who do not know him as a
decrepit man of eighty years is repudi
ated by the managers of Flint's cam
paign. They say they have been in no
way party to if.
"We-do not want to be connected in
any way with any such stories," said
John Mott, one of Flint's supporters.
"Our main desire is to keep free from
any attack upon any other candidate.
We are here to ooost Mr. Flint and
t-iiall confine ourselves strictly to that.
We have not and shall not say any
thing detrimental to any other candi
date."
Bard s managers will be able to con
vince the doubting legislators of his
hale condition and that he is a long
way from fighty when he gets here,
and they feel his presence will settle
many a wavering vote in his favor. r
Friends of Flint declare that Bard
will be doing injudicious politics if he
FOUR PROMINENT MEMBERS OF
THE UPPER HOUSE OF THE
STATE LEGISLATURE.
I recedes from his determination not to
Ibe present at the meeting of the Leg
! islature. They say his cojning now will
detract from his dignity and lose him
some of the admiration he has gained.
The definite announcement of Bard's
coming has naturally aroused great en
thusiasm at his headquarters and cre
ated excitement among those interest
ed in the election. The presence of a
real United States Senator as a can
didate will add largely to the import
ance of the battle.
Thomas Hughes of Los Angeles has
arrived to join the Bard forces, and his
j coming adds to the confidence in the
Senator's camp. Hughes is a leader of
recognized force in, the southern city,
and his enterprise and sagacity are
well known. His presence will add
much strength to the Bard fight. R.
N. Bulla, former Senator, is ex
pected here soon to aid in the Bard
fight, and other prominent Los An
geles Republicans may come up to as
sist. Bard does not lack powerful
friends in the city of angels.
Oxnard looks- upon himself as the
dark horseâas the man who must come
in to receive for the south that which
belongs to it in case neither Bard nor
Flint can reach the goal. He Is still
maintaining his headquarters and still
receives all coiners with that cheerful
smile and geniality that cannot but
make him friends, even if they are not
potent enough to draw votes already
tied up somewhere else.
L. M. Andrews and Walter Bacon
are still managing Oxnard's fight and
they show no dejection. It is evident
that they feel the lightning will tear
things up very close to them and con
sequently there is no talk of withdraw
ing the Oxnard camp. Oxnard points
to the fact that he is a friend of Presi
dent Roosevelt and that he is an advo
vate of the policy inaugurated by
Roosevelt and which will be carried
out for the next four years. It is
said by Oxnard's friends, however,
that his greatest desire is that the new
Senator shall be from the south and
that if he finds he cannot win the fight
he wil cast his influence in favor of
some other southern candidate.
A local paper, while Oxnard was in
San Francisco, published a story that
he had left Sacramento in a huff be
cause his candidacy had not been
taken seriously enough and that he
would not return. The publication
evidently perturbed Oxnard, who is
passing through his first campaign
and doesn't realize perhaps like some
of the other candidates just what a
soft path he is being allowed to travel.
So open and so quiet has been this
fight up to date that the candidates in
volved are drifting into a condition
that will cause them to die of shock if
they ever get mixed up in a real stren
uous battle for a toga.
*T merely went to San Francisco to I
see my brother off for the East," said I
Oxnard, "and transact some business. I
I haven't the least intention of going to |
China or anywhere else other than Sac-
I ramento for tne present.
One feature of Fisk's fight that is
I creating comment among the politi-
I cians is the fact that he is the first
[ Federal officeholder, in San Francisco
! who has made a fight for the "Senator
> ship while serving under the Govern
! ment. Others have come here to help
| candidates, but none to seek office
themselves. The late Collector, John P.
Jackson, interested himself in Perkins'
fight, United States Marshal Shine was
here for Grant in 1889, and John C.
Lynch, Internal Revenue Collector, was
here for Burns, later for Perkins and
now for Knight and Flint, but never
before has a man holding a Federal of
fice tried at the same time to become
United States Senator.
"Supposing Fisk should receive a tel
egram from the Postmaster General ad
vising him that his duties were in San
Francisco," suggested an Assembly
man, who, by the way, is not in the
Fisk column. He went no further than
the suggestion.
Fisk departed for the bay this after
noon, as did also John H. Lynch. There
will be a general exodus of candidates,
legislators and attaches to the me
tropolis to-morrow, and Sacramento
will relapse into its normal state until
Sunday night. Then they will come
surging back and the real life of the i
Senatoria4 contest will begin. Legis
lators who have been in doubt how
they were to cast their votes will have
made up their minds or received their
instructions: combinations will have
been decided upon. The last fierce
struggle to secure votes before the bal
loting begins will be inaugurated and !
the legislators will find themselves
pulled hither and thither by a whirl
wind of conflicting interests, the ma
jority to remain where they stood or
had been put, but some to waver and
change base, perhaps more than once
in the last two days before the ballot
ing should begin.
Knight and Flint are going down to
see Herrin and each will try to find out
whether he is to receive the votes that
the "Southen Pacific" controls. The
Ruef men at present are simply wait
ing.
Like soldiers on the field, who know
naught of what is before them, they
await the command that will send them
into the fray. "Somehow or another
they seem to think the man they land
on will be the Senator. They seem to
believe that other votes, controlled in
various ways, will go in the same di
rection. Incidentally some of them do
not think that $9 a day is enough
money for a man holding the dignified
title of Assemblyman. Ruef's men, i
some of them say, will never go for
Knight. The San Francisco boss dis
likes this particular Senatorial candi
date too much for that, they allege
It is said that Knight treated Ruef
with disdain at the Chicago convention,
and that the last named has treasured
this up.
Candidate Knight and Governor i
Pardee were to have had a talk to-day I
to renew felicitations and pledges of
friendship, but when the Senatorial
candidate called at the CaDitol the
Governor was deep in some matters of
legislation and Knight said he would
call another day. If he had had any
doubts on the matter, the publication
by The Call of the fact that the Gov
ernor had his hands entirely off the
Senatorial fight convinced Knieht that
the Governor was in no way obstruct
ing him.
Assemblymen from above Tehachapi
are still being sounded as to a caucus,
and one will undoubtedly be held by
the-northerners early next week if the!
south has not by that time united on a
man and elected him. The southern
delegation is holding many caucuses, i

After adjournment of the Assembly

heated caucus, called by Assemblyman
George McGowan, as a result of the no
tice given by Assemblyman Edward
Treadwell that he would move for a
reconsideration of a resolution by
which the report c-f the committee on
rules was adopted.
The clause in the rules which caused
Treadwell to jump the programme is
the making of the San Francisco dele
gation a standing committee "to whom
may be referred matters of interest in
particular to the city and county of
San Francisco: but not to the exclu
sion 'of jurisdiction of other commit
tees." %
Treadwell, it seems, was not aware of
the plan of his colleagues to have this
go through. â¢ The members of the dele
gation argued with Treadwell anoT en

tion, claiming that San Francisco could j
not get proper recognition on the floor |

I County's Pioneer Paper.
" The Marysville Appeal, one of tha
oldest daily papers in California, was
" sold yesterday to a Marysville com*
! | pany, at the head of which is Colonel
â¢j E. A. Forbes, the well known lawyer
iof that city. Fifteen days ago Forbes
' ; and a number of his associates pur
[ | chased the Mary sville Democrat and,
- I placing W. M. Cutter in the managing
, j editor's chair, declared that the future
i I policy of the paper would be political
.i iy independent.
. | Forbes and his political friends had
[ long been bitterly assailed by Editor
I I Frank Johnson of the Appeal and
i , when they got control of the Demo
! crat they declared war upon the rival
! newspaper owner. Realizing that
' ! Forbes and his associates, who are
i J prominent in Republican politics in
Yuba County, would be able to turn
the county patronage, which he had
enjoyed for many years, to their own
| paper. Editor Johnson gracefully de
clared his intention of retiring from the
newspaper field in that section of the
State. The result was the sale of the
Appeal to Forbes and his friends.
Colonel Forbes, who is staying at
the Palace Hotel, last night confirmed
the news from Marysville that the Ap
peal had been sold and added that
Railroad Commissioner A. C. Irwin,
j who is a director and stockholder in
~ the Democrat, had been appointed
temporary business manager of the
other paper. The Appeal will con
tinue as a Republican journal.

pending an investigation into her past

WARNING FROM THE SOUTH.
-Mrs. McCade arrived ht:e during the
Utter week of December and stayed
one night at the Palace, and on the fol-
Lowing day she went to the St. Francis
Hotel, where she registered as "Miss"
A. D. McCade. On the same day that
t-he telephoned to Davis & Co. request
in;: them to cash a second check she
presented a third for $25 to the cashier
of the St. Francis for collection in San
Bernardino. Meanwhile, however, the
n iragemrnt of the Van Nuys Hotel in
Los Angeles had advised the St. Fran
.tis not to cash the woman's checks
and hÂ°r $25 check is still in the hands 1
of the management of the latter hos
telry. Tuesday afternoon Mrs. Mc
<;;dÂ° quietly left the St. Francis and
the next heard from her was at the '
California Hotel, where she had reg- i
islered as Miss Julia Arnold of Oak
land.
Mrs. McCade is 26 years of age and
stylishly dressed. In the opinion of the
detectives, who closely questioned her
Monday night, she does not seriously
appreciate the offense she has com
mitted and at times appears to be
laboring under some great mental
trouble. She has told several rambling
stories and her entire demeanor has
lacked anything that would suggest
that she is experienced in the uttering
of bad checks.
ASPIRES TO THE STAGE.
Tt was learned yesterday, however,
that while recently a guest at the Van
Nuys Hotel in Los Angeles she passed
three checks, aggregating $85. drawn
on the State Bank of San Bernardino
When threatened with exposure she
made good the amount and left the
hotel. She says she is on friendly

A D V F.RTISEMENTS.
STRANGER THAN' FICTION.
A Remedy Which Has Revolutionized
the Treatment of Stomach
Troubles.
The remedy is not heralded as a won
derful discovery nor yet a secret patent
medicine, neither is It claimed to cure
anything except dyspepsia, indigestion
and stomach troubles with which nine
out of ten suffer.
The remedy is in the form of pleas
ant tasting tablets or lozenges, contain
ing vegetable and fruit essences, pure
'aseptic pepsin (Government test), gold
en seal and diastase. The tablets are
sold by druggists under the name of
.Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. Many in
teresting experiments to test the diges
tive power of Stuart's tablets show
that one grain of the active principle
contained in them is sufficient to thor
oughly digest 3000 grains of raw meat,
eggs and other wholesome food.
Stuart's Tablets do not act upon the
bowels like after dinner pills and cheap
cathartics, which simply irritate and
Inflame the intestines without having
any effect whatever in digesting food
or curing indigestion.
If the stomach can be rested and as
sisted in the work of digestion it will
very soon recover its normal vigor, as
no organ is so much abused and over- j
worked as the stomach.
This is the secret, if there is any se- !
crot, of the remarkable success of Stu- 1
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, a remedy
practically unknown a few- years ago !
and now the most widely known of any j
treatment for stomach weakness.
This success has been secured entirely
upon its merits as a digestive pure and !
simple because there can be no stomach >
trouble If the food is promptly digested.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act entire- !
ly on the food eaten, digesting it com- i
pletely, so that it can be assimilated I
into blood, nerve and tissue. They cure !
dyspepsia, water brash, sour stomach, 1
gas and bloating after meals, because '
they furnish the digestive power which '
weak stomachs lack and unless that j
lack Is supplied it is useless to attempt
to cure by the use of "tonics," "pills"
and cathartics which have absolutely
no digestive power.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be I
found at all drug stores and the regu- ; :
lar use of one or two of them after |
meals, will demonstrate their merit bet- \
ter than any other argument.

SERVICE BOARD
Examinations for Ambulance
and Patrol Drivers Are
Stopped by Court's Order
The Civil Service Commission was
last evening served with an injunction,
issued by Judge Murasky, restraining
It from proceeding with the examina
tions for police patrol and ambulance
drivers. This is the third attempt on
the part of the commission during the
last two years to place civil service ap
pointees in these positions.
There are 627 applicants for the po
sitions of ambulance and patrol driv
ers. Last night 150 of them present
ed themselves at the commission's
rooms to take the physical examina
tion, and because of the restraining or
der they were turned away. .
City Attorney Long is prosecuting the
case. It is said that the present hold
ers of the positions in question were
instrumental in having the injunction
issued.
On November 22. 1902, the Civil Ser
vice Commission attempted to exert its
authority and place its appointees In
the positions in question. An injunc
tion was obtained by those holding the
positions. Another Injunction was is
sued March 21, 1903, the one yesterday
making the third.
The injunction was asked for on the
ground that the drivers should be class
ed as laborers and taken from the list
ol* laborers, the charter making no spe
cific provision for classifying drivers
under the civil service. If sustained
the injunction will leave the men now
employed as drivers still in their po
sitions.

The Interior Department insists that
the various States that are enjoying

the presence of liquor resorts along

! WASHINGTON, Jan. s.âPresident
1 Roosevelt was the principal speaker at
a special session of the American For
estry Congress held this afternoon at
, the National Theater. The President
accompanied by Secretary Loeb ar
i rived at the theater promptly at 3
j o'clock. He was escorted to the stage
! entrance, and as he appeared be*fore
' the immense audience which filled
every part of the house the Deople re
; ceived him standing, while the theater
rang with applause and the orchestra
played a patriotic air.
Secretary Wilson, in presenting
President Roosevelt, who was the first
speaker, made no address, simply in
troducing Mr. Roosevelt as the Presi
dent of the United States. After the
applause had subsided the President
spoke in part as follows, his address
i being punctuated frequently with ap-
I plause:
It is a pleasure to greet the members of the
i American Forestry Congress. You have made,
by your coming, a meeting which is without
parallel in the history of forestry. For the
first time the great business and the forest
, interests of the nation have joined together.
! through delegates altogether worthy of the or
, ganization they represent, to consider their in
: dividual and their common Interests in the
j forests.
The producers, the manufacturers and the
i great common carriers of the nation had long
I failed to realize their true and vital relation
to the great forests of the United States, and
forests and industries both suffered from the
failure. But the time of interference and mis
understanding has gone by. 1
j The place of the forest in the life of any
nation Is far too large to be described In the
rime at my command. This is particularly
true of its place in the United States. No
man Is a true lover of his country whose con
fidence In its progress and greatness is limited
to the period of his own life, and we cannot
afford for one instant to forget that our coun
try is only at the beginning of its growth. Un
less tho forests of the United States can be
made ready to meet the vast demands whlcn
this growth will inevitably bring, commercial
f disaster la inevitable.
I If the present rate of forest destruction is
' allowed to continue a timber famine is obvi
, ously inevitable. What such a famine would
mean to each of the industries of the t'nited
: States it is scarcely possible to imagine. And
the period of recovery from the injuries which
; a timber famine would entail would be meas
ured by the slow growth of the trees them-
I selves.
Whatever it may be possible for the Gov- '
I ernment to accomplish. Its work must ulti
-1 mately fall unless your interest and support
give it permanence and power. It is only as
j the producing and commercial interests of the
! country come to realize that they need' to have
! the trees growing up in the forest not less
l than they need the product of the trees cut
i down that we may hope to see the permanent
i prosperity of both safeiy-^eiureil.
This statement Is true* "not offfy as to for
j eats In private ownership, but as to the na- j
â¢ tional forests aa well. Unless the men from
j the West believe in forest preservation the :
. Western forests cannot be preserved. I am ]
heartily glad to know that Western sentiment
supports more and more vigorously the policy |
of setting aside national forests, the policy of j
creating a national forest service and espe
cially the policy of increasing the permanent
usefulness of these forest lands to all those
who come in contact with them.
At the conclusion of the address the
President, bowing his acknowledgments
i to the audience, left the theater and re
turned to the White House, the audi
ence standing and the band plavinsr

Are Formally Withdrawn
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. s.âThe pre
senters of Bishop Ethelbert Talbot of
the Central Pennsylvania diocese of the
Protestant Episcopal Church, who have
not repudiated the paper filed against
him, to-night formally withdrew tht
charges in writing made against the
Bishop by friends of Dr. I. N. W. Ir
vine, the deposed priest. They reserve
the right to present new "charges in
writing."
The withdrawal is dated January 2.
and is addressed to Bishop Tuttle, to
whom a copy has been sent. The doc
ument begins by saying that all the
signers to the present paper knew the
contents and the purpose of the
"charges in writing" and enumerates
the changes as follows:
Crime, to wit: A criminal libel.
Immorality, to wit: False statements. i
Breach of ordination and consecration vowa.
Conduct unbecoming a Bishop.
Continuing, the document says:
We are in possession of such proof as is
sufficient, in our opinion, to put Bishop Talbot
upon trial. We believed, and sttll believe, that
the grounds are sufficient to put the accused
Bishop on his trial. The charges were formu
lated in order that the manifest scandal in
the church and the disgrace of the office of
Bishop Ethelbert Talbot should be inquired
into by the board of Inquiry, in the expectation
and belief that the board would direct the
church advocate to prepare a presentment to j
b<> signed by such of the board as agree
thereto. , I
Although Rev. Dr. Gilberson sisrned
the foregoing, he issued a statement to
night disavowing any further connec- |
tion with the case and will not allow j
his name to be used "to support such
fraud as has been perpetrated in this |

OLNEY'S ORDER
IN OPERATION
'â¢' Street Department Forces
Rip Out Many Signs That
. Had Not Been Removed
CLEAN IP IS GENERAL
Mayor Hopes the Next Step
Will Be to Bury All Elec
trical Wires Underground
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 5.
Street Inspector W. W. Blair and Su
perintendent of Streets C. F. Ott with
a force of men armed with sawst picks,
hammers and tongs and guarded by j
two policemen ripped, sawed, cut and I
dug standing signboards, posts and,
other sidewalk obstructions to-day
â long' Broadway. So far as the Street j
Department force went they cleaned the â¢
sidewalks thoroughly. The work will
be continued throughout the city.
The crusade was conducted in strict
adherence to the Mayor's instructions.
Merchants were given twenty-four
hours' notice to remove , their street
signs. Those who did not heed the
word were visited as rapidly as the J
street gang could move. Many oid
signs were carted off to the corpora
tion yard, their owners preferring to
permit the city to remove them instead
of going to the expense themselves. The
work was accomplished without serious
objections. Here and there a shopkeep
er rebelled, but by dint of tactful ex
planation Inspector Blair persuaded
the objecting one to join the procession.
Such signs as were taken in charge
by the city were those that had long
ago passed the stage of usefulness. It
is not the intention of the city officials
to cause unnecessary annoyance to
business men who have unwittingly
gone to heavy expense in installing
electrical displays. Reasonable- time
will be given for reconstruction of such
aigns so that they shall not obstruct
the streets or sidewalks.
Electric signs or others that are fasti
to buildings and can be, swung flush
with the property line when not in use i
will not be disturbed. There are a num- 1
ber of signs which are set fast to posts
and project across the sidewalk. These j
have been ordered down. Mayor Olney i
said to-day after Inspecting had
been accomplished in the direction of
improvement that he was in favor of
continuing the movement until all side
walk obstructions had been removed.
The next step will be toward ridding
the business section as rapidly as can
be done of all telegraph and telephone
poles.
All of the mhnicipal fire alarm and
'police telegraph wires are above
ground. Superintendent George Bab
cock estimates the cost of putting them
underground at $50,000. In his annual
report to the Board of Police and Fire
Commissioners Chief Engineer N. A.
Ball of the Fire Department has made
a, strong recommendation that all over
head- wires be removed as soon as pos
" sjble.
Many hundreds of telephone wires j
have been placed in underground con- !
. duits. The telephone company has also
Installed underground pipes for use in j
connecting lines with Its new buildings

. tempted to poison her, as well as their
, children, by putting rat poison in their
food. - Mrs. Addiago was the chief wit

trial to-day in the Police Court. She
' did not much more than sustain a
.- .minor charge of battery she had also
made against Addiago. Police Judge
Mortimer Smith reluctantly dismissed
the more serious case, but convicted
the husband of battery and will sen
tence him to-morrow.
Â«. â¢ When the wife applied for her hus
band's arrest she's insisted he had fol
â¢ lowed the poisoning episode by se
verely beating and kicking her. The
best she would do for the prosecution
to-day was to admit Addiago slapped
. her face.

OF MRS. HOPPER
ACTRESS' HEIRLOOMS STOLEN
Storeroom at Elegant San Leahdro YiHa Is
Entered by Thieves, Who Make Off
With Their Plunder in Wagon.
OAKLAND, Jan. sâThieves last
night stole several hundred dollars'
worth of plunder from the Dunsmiur
home at the Souther Farm, near San
Leandro, the property or Edna Wallace
Hopper, the actress. A storehouse in
which had been placed expensive pieces
of furniture, a handsome clock and
other articles of value was entered and
everything taken. The thieves must
have taken their plunder away in a !
wagon, the track of which was lost as
soon as it got upon the main highway, j
Constables and deputy sheriffs are j
busily engaged in an effort to trace the
trail of the burglars.
Notice of the robbery was telephoned

SUGAR BEETS
NEED THE SUN
Chemistry Division of the
Department of Agriculture
Tells of Its Research
WASHINGTON, Jan. s.âThat high
temperature and sunshine are the
dominant factors in producing the best
quality of sugar beets is anounced as
the result of five years' experiments
which have just been concluded by the
chemistry division of the Department
of Agriculture. The data obtained is
expected by agricultural officials to
save Immense amounts to capital by
pointing out on what sugar beet in
dustries should be instituted.
The experiments were made in lo
calities ranging from New York to
North Carolina and entirely across the
continent. The environments the in
fluence of which sugar beets require,
the soil, cultivation and the period of
artificial fertilization, temperature,
hours of sunshine and of cloudiness,
elevation and latitude -and longitude
are pointed out. The results indicate
that a high temperature is the greatest
of these factors in the producing of
beets with sunshine next in impor
tance.
The average temperature of the lo
calities, according to these results, not
exceeding 70 degrees Fahrenheit during
the three growing months, June, July
and August, is most desirable. Above
this figure richness of the beets con
stantly diminishes, and the longer day
and consequently longer hours of sun
shine makes a location best fitted for
high sugared beets.
TWO ARID LAND BILLS.
Senntor Bard Presents Irrigation Com

WASHINGTON, Jan. 5. â Senator
Bard, chairman of the Committee on
Irrigation, to-day introduced two bills
directed toward the development of
arid lands. One authorizes the Secre
tary of the Interior to construct Irriga
tion works along the shores of Little
Kiamath, Lave, Tule, Rhett and
Goose lakes, which lie on the boun
dary between Oregon and California.
The other provides that all lands cedefp
or purchased under the provisions of
the reclamation act shall be dis
posed of according to the same; that
lands not hitherto surveyed may be
surveyed and formed into farm units
of ten acres and that the Secretary of
the Interior may lease the lands for
such time as they are not needed in

naturalization to certain courts defi
nitely named and forbid all other
courts from entertaining naturaliza
tion proceedings; that the nature of
the testimony upon which naturaliza
tion may be conferred should be more
particularly prescribed by law than
it is now; th" 4 the language and
form of certificates should be pre
scribed; that they should be printed

returns of naturalization to ihe gen
eral Government.

especially prized by Edna Wallace
Hopper as heirlooms. It had been care
fully stored away during the altera
tion of some of the rooms at the beau
tiful villa.
The robbery is one of the boldest In
the annals of crime in the county.
Evidently familiar with the ground and
knowing just what they wanted and
how to get it, the thieves drove up the
private driveway with their wagon as
close as they dared and then proceeded
to the storehouse from which they
wrenched the lock with a jimmy. From
the tracks backward and forward
around the place a number of trips
must have been made between the
wagon and the storehouse. With prob
ably several hours of darkness to spare
they were miles away before there was
sufficient light to disclose to any
passerby what was in their wagon.

rine Commission have been prepared
in the form of a report, which to-mor
row will be. made iif the Senate by
Senator Mallory of Florida, and in

resentative Spight of Mississippi. Sen
ator Martin of Virginia is the only
Democratic member of the commis
sion who has not subscribed to the
minority views.
Representative Spight is the author
of the minority report, the principal
feature of which is advocacy of the
discriminating duty policy as a sub
stitute for direct Government aid for
American ship-owners, as proposed by
the bill presented by the commission.
In this bill the minority says: "We
cannot help but see the 'trail of tiie
serpent' that has been over all other
bills on this subject."

RENOWN OF BUENCAMINO
Notable Filipino. Whose
Boy Is at Berkeley, Sub
ject of Elaborate Story
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 5.
j The eyes of Felipe Buencamlno, a
j Filipino student at the State Univer
. sity, bulged out with delight to-day,
I when he was shown copies of the Cen
tury magazine, containing an illus
trated article which described in eu
logistic fashion young Buencamino's
father, who is one of the most promi
nent Filipinos on the islands.
David Gray, a correspondent and an
army officer . from . America spent
i Christmas with the Buencaminos in
! Manila, and Gray has written of the
! family, and the Christmas celebration
j enjoyed with its members.
I The son, who is at the university, is
'.referred to in the article, in connection
| with a paragraph which describes the
J senior Buencamino's habits of modern
| thought.
â¢ Pictures of the elder man, of his
wife and daughters adorn the article,
and the youngster at the university
danced with delight as he recognized
the loved familiar faces, in scenes
which to him are home.
The elder Buencamfno is rated as one
of the most able of the Filipinos. For
his services to the American Govern
ment he has been rewarded with power
and position. His loyalty to the Fili
pino people was not questioned during
their resistance to both Spain and
America, but when wisdom and
patriotism (these being the words of
Buencamino's admirers) dictated that
the Filipino people could serve their
own interests better by co-operation
with Americans than by resisting
them, then Buencamino "came in," as
the saying is. and with him most of the
influential men .of his party.
Aguinaldo is a friend and intimate
of the Buencaminos. Young Buencam
ino, at the university, knows the fa
mous war chief of the Filipinos from
having seen him at the Buencamino
household. The oÂ§ce belligerent war
rior is now at peace, but though de
feated, Buencamino says he has not
lost his hold on the Filipinos, who still
revere him.

been brooding for a long time over his
condition. Soon after Mrs. Main's
death several months ago Herbert
Main, the son, an employe of the
Southern Pacific Company, met an ac
cident which cost him many weeks of
suffering in the Railroad Hospital and
the loss of several fingers. Young
Main was barely out of bed when his
wife was taken seriously ill from ty
phoid fever and was sent to the hos
pital. These things distressed the
elder Main greatly.
Main was a native of Scotland. For
many years he was in business as an
expert accountant. Coroner Mehr
mann took charge of the body.
VAN HORNS WILL FIGHT
OVER POSSESSION OF BOY
Attorney for Mother Believes Appeal
From Divorce Decree Stays
Giving Son to Father.
OAKLAND, Jan. s.âWillis Van
Horn, the 14-year-old son of Professor
Ross Van Horn and Marion Van Horn
of Berkeley, was not produced in court
this morning by the mother, as di
rected by a writ of habeas corpus left
for her at her home at 2222 Bancroft
way, Berkeley, last night. This after
noon, however, Mrs. E. Sloane, a sis
ter bf Mrs. Van Horn's, appeared and
stated that she was not at home and
upon representations of her attorney
the matter was continued until Mon
day.
When the mother did not appear
this morning Van Horn felt fully con
vinced that the boy had been taken
out of the Jurisdiction of the court,
but the appearance of the sister and
her attorney allayed his anxiety. He
was granted the custody of the child
when given a divorce some weeks ago,
but has been unable to get the child
and has Instituted these proceedings,
to have it given him through the
courts. Attorney W. W. McNair, for
Mrs. Van Horn, has filed notice of an
appeal in the divorce case and is in
hopes that this will act as a stay on
the court's order until the appeal has
been heard.
Finds New Double Stars.
BERKELEY, Jan. 5. âMore double
stars have been discovered and meas
ured at the Lick Observatory. The
latest bulletin issued by the University 1
Press contains an account of another
hundred new double stars discovered
and measured by Assistant Astronomer
R. G. Aitken. These new double stars
are of the same character as those pre- I
vlously discovered at the Lick Obser
vatory. The distance between the two !
components in most of them is very I
small and nearly all would be difficult
objects to observe under conditions less
favorable than obtain at Mount Ham
ilton.
Special attention is called to two of
these new' pairs, because they consist
of closer components than previously
known double stars and are likely to
prove interesting binary systems.

OLD ST. JOHN'S
HALF CENTURY
Mother Episcopal Church of
Alameda County to Cele
brate Its Golden Jubilee
THREE DAYS' SERVICES
Members to Hold Memorial
in Honor of Father Aker
ly, Founder of the Parish
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 6.
The celebration of the Jubilee anni
versary of organization of St. John's j
Episcopal Church of Oakland will be- ,
gin at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning
with the parochial celebration of holy
communion and will continue until j
Sunday evening. January 8. Special
services will be held on each of the
three days, including a union service of
all the parishes of Alameda County,
and a memorial service for the Rev.
Benjamin Akerly, D. D., the founder of
Bt. John's Church. The Right Rev.
William Ford Nichols, Bishop of the di- j
ocese; the Right Rev. Sidney C. Par
tridge, Bishop of Kioto, Japan; the
Rev. W. A. Brewer, registrar of the
diocese; the Rev. David McClure of
San Francisco, the Rev. S. J. Lee and
the rectors of the Episcopal churches
of Alameda County will participate in
tho jubilee celebration.
St. John's Episcopal Church was or
ganized in 1855 and is known as the
"mother church" of Alameda County.
The church was established by the
Rev. Benjamin Akerly, D. D., who for
many years was its rector. The first
regular service was held on the first
Sunday after Epiphany, in 1855. in an
upper room on the corner of Broadway
and Seventh street. During the long
rectorship of Dr. Akerly, while St.
John's was yet a mission, its clergy
man and people reached out to plant
new altars in other places, and to as
sist in maintaining those already set
up. To read the history of St. John's
Church is to read a very important
part of the history of the other Epis
copal churches in Alameda County.
On Sunday morning, December 13,
1896, the main building of the church
was destroyed by fire, but the guild
room and the vestry were saved, and
with them were saved the parish rec
ords, containing all the more important
historical records of the church. The
present church building at Eighth and
Grove streets was erected almost on
the site of the >one destroyed by fire,
and the Rev. W. A. Brewer, who will
preach the jubilee sermon next Sunday
evening, preached the sermon at the
dedication of the new edifice.

FAMILY OF SIX
CROSSES DESERT
W. A. Wright, Wife and Four
Daughters Travel From
Colorado in an Old Wagon
ARRIVE IN BERKELEY
Five Teams of Horses Worn
Out in Long and Tedious
Journey to California
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Jan. 5.
The days of '49 were recalled to
those who have read of tbe overland
pilgrimages made at that time when
Warren A. Wright, hla wife
and four daughters rolled into
Berkeley last night in a "P r & iri Â®
schooner," in which they have lived
since July 7. The girls and their par
ents have traveled 5:400 miles over
desert, mountain, river and P- laln
wearing out five pairs of horses in tne
journey, and at last they have found
a haver- in South Berkeley.
The father was in search of employ
ment when he left Boulder. Colo., si*
months ago. He is a paper-hanger.
Fayette, Idaho, was his objective point.
That was a 400-mile trip. There was
nothing for him at Fayette, and then
began the long overland Journey to
California, through the Northwest and
down the coast by way of Oregon.
Mrs. Wright said to-day:
The trip wae a weird one. I wonder we lived
through it. Once when our horses gave out on
the desert nobody would sell ue hay. Some
times the alkali and thirst nearly drove us
wild. At night we often fought mosquitoes,
unable to sleep. Often we helped the animals
pull the wagon through the sand and snow.
At night we would think of home and pray.
The four girls of the family range in
age from 16 to 4 years. The Wrights
have rented a cottage at Fifty-eighth
and McCalla streets. When they light
ed the fires there last night it was the
first inclosure they had found shelter
In, besides their tented wagon, since
July 7.
OAKLAND'S MOST
GIFTED SINGER
NOW A BRIDE
BY ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND. Jan. announce
ment of the marriage last evening of
Miss Carolyn Crew to E. Walter Kasor
is one of the many surprises the new
year has had in store for us. It is only
lately that the friends of the talent
ed young singer have begun to suspect
thatf mere man was sharing her devo
iior( to art, and preparations for last
night's event were so quietly made
that few knew it was to be.
This wedding was a charming home
affair, a profusion of Christmas berries,
and holiday greens supplying an ar
tistic setting for the nuptial picture.
The ceremony was simplicity itself.
Rev. Dr. Dille officiating. There were
no attendants, the bride being given
into her husband's keeping by her
father, J. S. Crew.
The bride, who is petite and bru
nette, wore neither veil nor bridal
white, her gown being an exquisite cre
ation of pearl gray chiffon. A notice
able ornament glittered on her breast â
the diamond cross, which was the wed
ding gift of her mother.
Tnis happy young bride of a day
has probably the most perfect lyric
soprano of any singer in California.
Her voice acquired a rare perfection
of tone under the careful training of
Clement P. Rowlands, who. up to his
recent departure for England, was her
only tutor. Siuce then she has been
studying with Dr. H. J. Stewart of
San Francisco.
Mrs. Ra3or avers that marriage shall
make no change in the musical career
she has mapped out for herself. She
will continue to occupy her position
as leading soprano in the choir of the
First Methodist Church, and will also
take part, as planned, in the opera
Miss Cope is now rehearsing for the
big Fabiola benefit.
Mr. and Mrs. Rasor will enjoy their
honeymoon in the southern part of
the State, and on their return will re -
side at 1376 Haight street, San Fran
cisco, where the groom has made ready
a beautiful home for his bride.
The groom is vice president of the
well-known lumber firm of Sudden &
Christenson.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Mrs. James A. Johnson will entertain
next Monday afternoon.
â¢ â¢ â¢
On Tuesday Mrs. Henry Abrahamson
will be nostess at a large card party
given to a number of her girl friends.

Walsh for Saturday week. A dozen
guests will enjoy a luncheon and the
ater party across the bay.

the entire party had been ambushed

EXPECT LIVELY
TIME IN DENVER
Legislature of Colorado
Is Keady to "Do Things*'
at Its Session To-Day
DENVER, Jan. s.âTo-morrow the
Colorado Legislature will "commence
to do things." When the joint session
of the House and Senate was dissolved
at 5:30 o'clock this afternoon all the
preliminaries to the canvassing of the
vote for State officers had been swept
away.
It is known that Lieutenant Gover
nor Haggott is of the opinion that the
courts are the proper place for the ad
justment of political contests, and an
effort may be made to induce or force
him to give way to Speaker Dickson,
who is favored by those members of
the Legislature who believe that the
contest between the rival candidates
for the Governorship should be settled
by the Legislature itself.
The message of Governor Peabody
read by the Governor, dealt, for the
most part, with recommendations con
corning reports frcm the various Slate
institutions. On the subject of the
militia, he touched briefly, referring the
Legislature to the executive report of
Adjutant General Sherman Bel, which
was so large that the Governor de
clared that he could not attempt to
epitbmize it. On the question of elec
tions, the message was as follows:
The fraudulent conduct oi elections under
our present system demands your immediate
and conc-rten action. in a general way it
seems sufficient to say that a modern primary
and registration law should be enacted and
the advisability of introducing voting machines
should be considered. In sorrow we must ad
mit that (ha elective franchise, especially in
Denver, has been sadly misused and prosti
tuted. A patient people protest and these out
raiti- should Us ended.
On the labor troubles the Governor,
after urging the adoption of a reason
able eight-hour law, said:
B*r!y In ;ny administration a certain organ
ization hnown as the Western Federation of
Miners, claiming public consideration under
the nr-me of labor, whose officers and those In
direct charge of Its management are bold,

WILL APPEAL
FROM DECISION
Harriman and Pierce Are to
Carry Northern Securities
Case to the Supreme Court
NEW YORK, Jan. s.âThat the
Northern Securities case will be taken
up to the United States Supreme Court
on a writ of certiorari by E. H. Harri
man and the interests allied with him
was announced by W. D. Guthrie of
counsel for the Harriman faction to
day. Copies of the decision of the
United States Court of Appeals were
received by counsel to-day. After pe
rusal of the decree Guthrie said an ap
plication for a w-rit would be made to
the Supreme Court as soon as the court
reconvened.
The Court of Appeals dissolved the
injunction which had been secured by
the Harriman interests restraining: the
distribution of the assets of the North
ern Securities Company nr.d its decision
was in effect a defeat for the interests
of Harriman and Winslow S. Pierce to
secure the return of the Northern Pa
cific stock which they turned over to
the Northern Securities Company, and
which was valued at $75,098.000.
It is expected that a writ of certio
rari from tho United States Supreme
Court will act as a stay and prevent
temporarily the distribution of the
Northern Pacific stock held by the
Great Northern Company.

OPPOSES DISSOLUTION
OF IRRIGATION DISTRICT
Attorney of Escondido Says Petition
Was Not by Majority of
Stockholders.
SAN DIEGO. Jan. 6. âAttorney F.
P. Willard of Escondido this ' after
noon filed a document in the Superior
Court opposing the dissolution of the
Escondido Irrigation District. It is al
leged that the petition for the dissolu
tion of the district was not signed by
a majority of the land owners of the
district and that the assessment made
is not a valid lien against the proper
ty. It is further alleged that the plan
proposed is a scheme to change the
irrigation district into a stock com
pany and sever the water from the
land.
Some weeks ago the property own
ers of the district voted to pay off
the indebtedness of the district
amounting to a quarter of a million
dollars. This wjas done and it was
then proposed to form a water asso
ciation. Attorney Willard says the as
sociation would not be a public utility,
but on the contrary would'be a close
corporation. The court has not yet
confirmed the dissolution. The pro
test will be heard by Judge Conklin
at a date not yet set.

JOHN MoN AUGHT Manager

FRIDAY JANUARY Â«, 1905
CESSION OF THE YOSEMITE.
MEMBERS of the Native Sons' organization originated the
proposition to re-cede the Yosemite Valley and the Mari
posa Big Tree Grove to the Federal Government. The val
ley is now surrounded by the Yosemite Xatibnal Park, which is
under Federal jurisdiction, and the Big Tree Grove is surrounded
by a forest reserve, also under Federal jurisdiction.
The originators of the re-cession policy sought its indorsement
by the State Board of Trade. That body is in such high repute as
the promoter of all the material interests of the State that its in
dorsement is continually solicited by persons and organizations for
matters of public concern. The power and position of the State
Board of Trade have been preserved by the caution with which it
examines all these appeals. W hen any matter gets its indorsement it
is passed to the confidence of the State. The State Board refused
to indorse the policy of re-cession of the Yosemite Valley and Big
Tree Grove, and immediately provided a plebiscite to test the con
dition of public opinion as to that matter, for the benefit of the
Legislature.
This wise course on the part of the board is justified by the
general attention that has been aroused. So far it is apparent that
the proposition does not meet with favor. The reasons given for the
opposition are various, but in the mass of expressions appears some
influence looking to the use of the opinions presented as an influence
upon the Legislature, to secure large appropriations for the valley
from the State treasury.
This makes proper a statement of the reasons put forward by
the proponents of the re-cession, since these seem to have received
no consideration by a majority of those who have expressed them
selves in the matter. The re-cession was not put upon the financial
needs of the valley. The appropriations have been quite sufficient
for the proper and economical administration of the trust. If made
much larger they will promote extravagant vagaries that will injure
rather than conserve the great scenery of the valley. There is no
good reason for expecting that the Federal Government would much
increase the expenditures now made by the State. So the financial
considerations may be eliminated.
The actual reason for the cession is that as long as the State
administers the valley within the Yosemite National Park there is
a divided jurisdiction, frequently working at cross purposes and
often in open antagonism. To reach the valley from any direction
visitors must pass over the National Park under Federal control.
The roads and means of access are not controlled by the State at all.
. It cannot increase the facilities of access, nor in any way affect the
regulations of the National Park that incloses its jurisdiction. Un
der these circumstances the Federal Government has been besought
to buy and improve the roads to the valley, but obviously it has no
interest in doing so. If it had jurisdiction of the valley it would
naturally have to own and maintain those roads. The State will not
spend what is necessary to buy the roads and keep them up for
they run through Federal jurisdiction. In this and a variety of other
ways the divided jurisdiction is felt as an incumbrance.
There are two ways to end it. One would be the cession of the
Yosemite National Park to the State; the other the re-cession of the
valley to the United States. We may be pardoned for saying that
there is no question of State pride at issue, though it seems to be
used to enlarge the appropriations for the valley. The valley and
the Big Trees were there before the State's trusteeship existed, and
they would stand steadfast in their place, with undiminished gran
deur, if divided jurisdiction ceased and the administration were turned
over to the United States. As it js proposed to put the national
parks in the care of the Federal Bureau of Forestry, of which Mr.
Gifford Pinchot is the head, it is probable that the administration
would be greatly improved and that California would enjoy every
advantage now offered by the valley and the trees at Federal ex
pense.
This, we take it. is a reasonable statement of the position of the
â¢ re-ceders. There is considerable hysteria in the expression of each
side in the matter. But for this there is no good reason. Of course
the parties who now enjoy the official advantages and emoluments
incident to State jurisdiction see dark plots and sinister motives in
the proposition, but the general public can afford indifference to these
visions.
In Golden Gate Park we have an example of a change of juris
diction that did not! obliterate any of the charms of that famous
spot. The Commissioners of that park, formerly appointed by the
Governor, are now appointed by the Mayor, and not a leaf has faded
nor a blade of grass grown dull in consequence. So would it be if
the United States received back the valley and the trees, and re
lieved our .State treasury of the cost of caring for them. In such
a> matter it is well to eliminate tragedy and epithet.
THE CONVERSION OF TSI AN.
j. . 1â i
IT is unofficially announced that Mr. Conger, our Minister to
China, with tin assistance of his wife, has converted the Empress
Dowager to Christianity, or at least to the cult known as Chris
tian Science, that peculiarly appeals to the Oriental mind. Tsi An
has for many years been the actual ruler of China, and up to the
conclusion of the Boxer war was stubbornly reactionary against all
reforms in that empire. After that she proceeded to relax much of
her rigor. The Manchus were ordered to intermarry with the Chi
nese, and were instructed to travel and seek education in the West
ern nations, like the Chinese have done for years. She also decreed
lhat the process of producing small feet in women should be no
longer practiced. Then she invited the wives of the foreign Ministers
to take tea with her. and unbent to a degree that was gratifying to
the legation ladies.
It was rumored that her marked preference for the society of
Mrs. Conger excited some jealousy among the ladies of the other le
gations, but the intimacy continued and is now said to have been
used by the Minister's wife in making an imperial convert to the
doctrines of Mrs. Eddy. As Christian Science is a strictly American
institution, of Boston origin, this conversion should result in the
progressive Yankeeizing of China. Whatever one may choose to
think about the Eddy religion the political effect of the adhesion of
Tsi An may be very marked. We have to advise her. however,
that it will not do to rely on Christian Science to defend her fron
tiers or preserve the territorial integrity of her empire. The land
grabbers do not care a tinker's dam, which is made of wet bread, for
mind waves, when it comes to seizing a seaport or pocketing a hin
terland. It may help her rheumatism and her often infirmities, but
guns, powder and soldiers will still be needed to keep the white
devils from gobbling up her country.
ANOTHER FROM KANSAS.
SOME irresponsible Solon of the Kansas Legislature has an
nounced his intention of submitting a bill legalizing the propa
ganda of the ten year marriage, which was advanced recently
by a respected British author now manifestly in his dotage. This
radical reformer of the social order would have it that marriages
should be regulated by the renewal of the license every ten years,
just as we give continuance to the privilege of conducting a saloon or
allowing a dog to run loose; then would the family tie be ideal ac
cording to his reckoning and the State Utopian.
We are accustomed to almost anything coming out of Kansasâ
Populism, Carrie Nation, giant pumpkins and cyclonesâthe list of
curiosities is varied and interminable. This new freak of social phil
osophy is, then, probably but a sport of the hard winter or a mani
festation of the effect of spots on the sun. In the light of former
experiences with the Kansas product of thought we can afford to be
indulgent. A joint caucus of men and women, called to con
sider the worth of this ten year marriage law, would certainly be
instructive if it did not contribute to the gayety of the nations. i

AURORA'S MODEL
HARRISON SMITH
IT had originally been a big. bare
garret, but under Aurora's magic it
was transformed into a decidedly
attractive studio. Tapestry hang
ings concealed the ugly outlines of un
planed studding: wide divans littered
with comfortable cushions suggested
luxurious repose; a curiously carved
cabinet stood near one of the windows.
"1 am waiting." lie said pa
tiently.
and quaint brasses, candlesticks, fend
ers and copper kettles were everywhere.
There was orderly disorder and restful
chaos.
Under the wide north light sat Auro
ra before an easel, her hair bristling
with an imposing array of scalpels and
brushes. On the canvas before her an
autumn landscape was slowly coming
into being. The landscape was not de
veloping satisfactorily, and the Bcalpels
were being pressed into service quite as
much as were the brushes.
The door opened and Paul Radford
entered. He stood apologetically by the
door smiling blandly at the girl before
the easel.
"Hello, Aurora!" said he with a
meekness becoming an intruder.
"Ccune in and shut the door," said
Aurora. "You must sit down and be
very quiet. This is my busy day."
Radford tossed his coat and hat upon
a divan, thrust his hands into his pock
ets and strode over to the easel.
Jove, Aurora, that's a stunning ma
rine," he observed.
"It's not a marine," said she testily.
"It's a landscapeâautumn."
"Oh," said he, "isn't that water in
the foreground?"
"That," said Aurora, scraping an
overdone cloud zealously, "will be a
cow when it's finished."
"I beg the cow's pardon, I'm sure."
said Radford. "I hope it's to be a red
cow, Aurora. I'm very partial to red
cows." >
"Please Bit down," she snapped impa
tiently. "You'll find some magazinesâ
somewhere about," she ended vaguely.
"Sorry, but I haven't time to look for
them," he said. "Besides, I came here
this afternoon to offer myself as a
model."
"A model for what?" she asked. "In
dolence?"
"A model of sorrow," said he.
"You don't look your part particular-
I ly." she remarked.
I "I'm consumed with it," he declared
i gloomily.
"How sad!" she said mockingly.
| Radford retired-to a divan in the cor
ner and settled comfortably on a pile
of cushions.
"If you could tra/isfer my sorrow to
i canvas your name would be made," he
1 said.
i Since when has this affliction de
scended upon you?" she asked.
"Since Tuesday afternoon at 4:30."
"Pshaw!" said Aurora, her eyes fixed
on the landscape.
it's no pshawing' matter with me,"
I said he. "Your sixth refusal has filled
j me with gloom."
"Perhaps a seventh might hearten
you a bit." she suggested maliciously,
i "There'll probably be a seventh be
fore I leave," he returned despond
ently.
Aurora laughed: then she turned
about in ncr chair and regarded him
gravely.
"Paul, why on earth can't you be
sensible?' 1 she asked. "Why can t you
good friends with me without âoh,
spoiling it all?"
"My dear Aurora." he explained sol
emnly, "if Providence had intended
men to be sensible in your presence,
be would never have given you that
cbin and those lips and "
"Bosh!" said Aurora, coloring a bit.
Kadford deserted the divan and
came over to the easel. He stood for
a time looking down at the girl
thoughtfully.
"I'll make a compact with you," he
said at length. "Tell me for the
seventh time that you won't marry me,
and I'll see to it that it is the last."
"And we'll be friends ever after?''
she said lightly.
"No, we won't be friends," he said,
"except in name."
She shrugged her shoulders, but
said nothing.
"Listen, Aurora, just say 'no' once
more and I'll take myself off. I won't
trouble you after that. I'll leave you
to your landscapesâandâandâthe
fellow who is luckier than I."
She looked up. His face was very
grave. It was unlike him to be seri
ous. She felt a trifle alarmed.
""Now, Aurora," he said quietly, "tell
me for the seventh time and I'll.go."
Aurora made a pretense of re
touching the cloud.
"I am waiting." he said patiently.
Still she said nothing. Radford
picked up his hat and coat. Then he
again took his stand by the easel.
"Are you going?" she said weakly,
j "As soon as you tell me," said he.
Aurora arose deliberately from the
J easel. She went over to the window
and began to clean her palette with a
scalpel. Radford watched her and his
eyes narrowed dangerously.
"Of course it means very little to
you," he burst out hotly, "but it seems
to me you need not delay in this use
less fashion. Y.ou might at least be
mercilful."
Aurora lifted her eyes slowly, and
as slowly her face lighted with a won
{ derful smile.
j "There are several ways of being
merciful," she said gently.
In a moment one of the brushes in
her hair had left a ghastly streak of
red on his face.

EXTRA VAGANCES
OF OUR SENATORS
The salary of a United States Sena
tor, like that of a member of the
House of Representatives, is $5000.
and he is allowed, in addition, mileage
at the rate of 10 cents per mile each
way between his home and the Capi
tol for each session of Congress, a pri
vate secretary at $1500 (if he is not
chairman of a. committee, in which
case he has the appointment of a
j higher salaried clerk) and $125 for
'stationery. That seems modest; but
the perquisites and emoluments not
; set down in the law are numerous and
' attractive and account in. no small
; measure for the tenacity with which
a small caliber Senator holds on when
once he has been elected.
The Senate is a small body, but It
takes a big amount of money to run
it. as the following extracts from the
last annua) appropriation bill will

it is to record the doings of ninety
law-makers, and to keep them com

twelve months, but it is the details
that are most interesting.
In 1878 a Senator of the United
States provided himself out of the
public treasury, in addition to his sal
ary, with his mileage, his $125 for
stationery, and one clerk, if he hap
i pened to be the chairman of a com

! 1904 a United States Senator would
sniff at one clerk, and declare it im
possible to attend to his work without
two or three. Such a thing as paying
for a clerk out of his pocket, as his
predecessors, up to a comparatively
few years ago. were accustomed to do,
would be regarded by the Senator of
to-day as a crime.âDecember Pear

HOW B*l EVEN SOX
VIEWED WOMAX
Mrs. Kate Leslie Smith has contrib
uted a most attractive article to yie
! January number of the Bnoklovers
I Magazine on "Stevenson's View of
\ Woman." Mrs. Smith says that "to
, form an opinion of Stevenson's attitude
to women in generalâor woman in
| particularâfrom a critical study of his
i heroines, would be making the greatest
possible mistake." His heroines are
disappointing. "That he loved his
mother devotedly, we know well from
his letters," continues Mrs. Smith, "and
yet when he named his heroines, what
a phenomenal procession of motherless
girls! Kirstie Elliott, Catriona. Bar
j bara Grant. Flora Gilchrist, Blanche de
Maletrolt. and many another. How
frequently he testifies to the success
and happiness of his own marriage; yet
;we look in vain in his books for pic

tent ourselves with sketches of Jim
Pinkerton and his bride In 'The Wreck

'Providence and the Guitar.' and the
generous struggle of Keawe and his
Kokua to buy the bottle from each
other in 'The Bottle Imp.' "
Stevenson owed much to women: to
his nurse, to his wife, and to his f lend

More than any other country of the

Saturday Review, the United States
â¢ may be regarded as a complete homo

: raise all the live stock that it needs,
i its cotton plantations are sufficient to
supply all its requirements, its mineral
resources both on base and precious
metals are extensive, and its coal mines

Add to this every year enormous ac
cessions by immigration of carefully
selected adult able-bodied and skillful
workmen to assist in the development
of these very varied resources. The
development of that country is prob
ably due in large degree to these
causes. We may be sure that, in the

independent of all other countries.
World's Best Timepiece.
! The world's best timepice, an elec
tric clock in the basement of the Ber
lin Observatory, was installed by
Professor Foerster in 1865, and has
often run two or three months with
an average daily deviation of only
15-1000 of a second. To improve even
this marvelous performance, the as
tronomers in charge are arranging to
place the air-tight glass case in an un
derground vault, securing freedom
from changes of temperature and air
pressure.

MRS. METCALFE
GETS REVOLVER
Presents Order for Fire Arm
With Which Keeley After
ward Shoots Her Husband
SAMPLES AID CULPRIT
They Neglect to Inform the
Police While He Changes
Clothes in Their Rooms
At the inquest yesterday on
the death of Edward Bruce Metcalfe
the fact was brought out in the testi
mony that Mrs. Metcalfe presented to
Mrs. William Sample of 603 Eddy street
an order for the revolver with which
Edward Pierce Keeley afterward, on
December 29, murdered her husband. It
was also shown that Mr. and Mrs. Sam
ple shielded Keeley from arrest and as
sisted him to escape after he had con
fessed to them that he had murdered
Metcalfe.
Mr. and Mrs. Sample testified that
shortly before 2 o'clock, less than an
hour after the shooting, Keeley had
come to their rooms and said, "I have
done it."
"What have you done?" asked Mrs.
Sample.
"I shot Bruce," replied Keeley.
Keeley had then explained that he
went to Metcalfe's room at 18 Seventh
street and heard somebody crying. He
then knocked on the door and it was
opened. The room was in darkness, and
Keeley drew his revolver and shot Met
calfe. He heard Metcalfe fall and then
left the building.
Mr. and Mrs. Sample, leaving Keeley
in their rooms, went to 18 Seventh
street. They passed two or three
patrolmen on the way, but did not tell
them that Keeley was the murderer
and that he was then in their rooms.
"Why did you not inform those po
licemen that the murderer was in your
rooms?*' inquired a Juror.
"Becauseâwell, I didn't inform
them," replied Mrs. Sample, giving "the
woman's reason."
When they returned to their house
Keeley was still in their rooms. He had
shaved off his mustache and put on a
pair of blue overalls over his trousers.
Then, Mrs. Sample said, she ordered
him out of the house, and he went.
Sample told about a revolver given
him by a cousin by marriage whose
present whereabouts was unknown to
him. He had offered the revolver to
Keeley for $1, as he did not want to
have it lying about the house, and had
given Keeley an order on Mrs. Sample
for the weapon. When Keeley present
ed the order Mrs. Sample could not find
the key of her trunk, and he went away
without it. Several days later Mrs.
Metcalfe presented the order, and Mrs.
Sample gave Keeley the revolver the
next time he called. That was a few
days before the murder.
Mr. and Mrs. Sample testified that
they had always known Mrs. Metcalfe
as Mrs. Keeley and supposed that she
was Keeley's wife.
The jury returned a verdict charging
Edward Pierce Keeley with the murder
of Edward Bruce Metcalf* 3 on Decem
ber 29. â¢

SHOTS FRIGHTEN
HOTEL GUESTS
Bellboy at the Berkshire
Fires at Another and Two
of the BuUets Take Effect
WOUNDS NOT DANGEROUS
Assailant Surrenders Him
self and Declares the
Shooting Was Accidental
A shooting affray at the Berkshire
Hotel, 711 Jones street, yesterday
morning caused the wildest excitement
for a few minutes among the guests.
The participants were William Grant,
head bellboy, and Robert Drake, one of
-his assistants, both colored. Grant
was wounded in the hand and leg and
was taken to the Central Emergency
Hospital. Drake surrendered himself
to the police.
Grant and Drake quarreled on
Wednesday night and while Drake was
going upstairs carrying a tray Grant
struck him. Drake put the tray down
to defend himself, but Grant took
refuge in the elevator.
The manager of thÂ» hotel on hear
ing of the occurrence discharged Grant
yesterday morning. Grant went to his
room to pack up and Drake was ad
vised to keep away from him till he
had left the hotel. Miss E. Kincfdd, a
waitress, had given Grant two skirts
to get cleaned and she went to his
room to ask him where he had taken
them.
While she and Grant were talking
Drake made his appearance and said
to Grant, "I want to see you." Grant
replied, "I have seen all I want of
you," and closed his door. Drake, who
had a stick in his left hand and had
his right hand in his hip pocket, pushed
the door open. Just then Miss Klncaid
turned and walked away. She heard
three shots fired In quick succession,
but did rÂ»ot know who fired them.
The police were at once notified and
Detective Ed. Gibson was detailed on
the case. He sent Grant to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital and while the
detective was making inquiries at the
hotel Drake surrendered himself at
police headquarters. He declared that
Grant had drawn the revolver and that
during a struggle for its possession it
was discharged three times. One bul
let struck Grant on the hand, another
in the leg and the third struck the
wall. The police discredit Drake's
story. He was locked up pending de
velopments.
WYMAN TRIAL STILL DRAGS
IN JUDGE LAWLOR'S COURT
Justice's Comment on Point Advanced
by Attorney Countryman Rouses
Some Little Interest.
The progress of the Wyman trial
was as slow yesterday as it was the
day preceding. The only moment
when any interest was displayed was
when Judge Lawlor said, in reply to
a point advanced by Attorney Coun
tryman, "The case you have cited does
not point that crime cannot be
committed, even If the proceedings
connected with the election be found
faulty."
The morning session and most of
the afternoon were consumed in prov
ing the validity of the petitions of the
parties in the primary election in
question. Countryman fought every
inch, objecting on every possible tech
nicality. One of his objections w T as
sustained by the court.
He contended that the notice of
election was not published three times
in a daily paper, fifteen days before
the time of election. This was sus
tained, and the notice of election was
not entered as evidence. Several times
during the day Attorneys Countryman
and Hosmer treaded on the borders
of repartee. They were admonished
by Judge Lawlor. who hinted that
there was too much talk wasted in
the case.
The roster of voters in the Seventy
third Precinct, where the felony is al
leged to have been committed, was
produced just at the close of the af
ternoon session. The prosecution will
probably offer evidence intended to
show the actual commission of the
crime to-day.
Says Drummer Was Idle.
Tlllmann & Bendel yesterday filed
an answer and cross-complaint to the
suit of F. P. Katz, a whisky drummer,
who demanded 59125 25 damages be
cause he had been discharged before
the expiration of his contract. He was
to be paid $6500 for the first year and
$7500 for the second, and entered
upon his duties in August, 1903. In
May, 1904, he was discharged, and
thereupon he sued. The firm, in its
answer, says he was not discharged
without reason, but from September,
1903. to the following May had idled
away his time, lost many customers
for the firm and refused to abide by
the company's regulations. On this
account, in its counter claim, the com
pany sues him for $15,000.

Chan Cheung Files a Chal

to Set Aside Indictment
GROUNDS ARE ALLEGED
Argument Before JudgeLaw
lor on the Points Raised
Will Be Heard To-Morrow
When the case of Chen Cheung.
I indicted by the Grand Jury for the
; murder of Tom Yick of the Chinese
Educational Society in May. 1903, was
called in Judge Lawlor's court yes
-1 terday for the defendant to plead,
i his attorneys filed a motion to set
j aside the indictment. The grounds al
leged are that it was not found, ln-
I dorsed and presented as prescribed by
! the Penal Code; that the names of the
â¢ witnesses examined of whose deposi
tions were read were not inserted at
the foot of the indictment or indorsed I
j thereon, and - that a person was per
' mitted to be present when the charge
j'was under consideration who was not
' privileged or entitled to be present
A challenge to the Grand Jury was
I also filed on a number of grounds,
'â  among them that the requisite number
of ballots had not been drawn from
the ballot-box; that notice of the draw
ing had not been given and that It was
: not had in the presence of the officers
j designated by law. The grand Jurors
!as individuals were challenged on the
. grounds that at the time the Grand
; Jury began its Inquiry a state of
; mind existed on the part of each mem.
I ber in reference to the case which
j prevented him from acting impartial- .
.ly and without prejudice to the de
fendant.
The case was continued till to-mor
| row when arguments on the motion
I and challenge will be heard. Attorney
I Bell of counsel for the defendant said
he would subpoena each member of
the Grand Jury to be present to tes
tify on the challenge.

SLOAN TO WEAR CORRIGAN'S
GREEN AND WHITE COLORS
Famous Jockey Expects to*Be Rein
stated in This Country on the
French Court's Decision.
CHICAGO. Jan. s.âTod Sloan, the
much talked of jockey, and, as his
friends declare, the much abused
youth of the saddle, is in this city. He
is, according to Ed Corrigan, to ride
for the latter next season, providing
the turf body in control gives him a
license. That he will get one is based
on the opinion of the French court's
decision that Sloan is entitled tp $40,
--000 for the injury done in ruling him
off by the French Jockey Club. The
feeling here is that Sloan is guiltless
of any turf crime abroad.
Sloan's appearance in the saddle
again will be watched with much in
terest to see if he has lost any of
his old time skill, judgment of pace
and ability to get a horse to run kind
ly for him.
CHOKER'S HORSES CANNOT
BE TRAINED AT NEWMARKET
Jockey Club Officials Refuse Per
mission, but as Usual Give
No Reason for the Action.
NEWMARKET, England, Jan. 5.â
The Jockey Club has refused to grant
permission for the horses of Richard
Croker recently purchased In Ireland
to train at Newmarket. As usual the
club officials gave no reason for its
action.
The secretary wrote to J. E. Brewer
of Heath House at Newmarket, with
whom Mr. Crocker had placed three
of his Irish horses for training, that
he would not be permitted to train
there. The three horses are still at
Newmarket.

Mansard Meets With
Poor Racing Luck
v and Gets Place.
Smithy Kane Awakes
With a Start and
Nearly Wins.
Jakie Jones didn't accomplish much
with Misty's Pride in the five-furlong j
purse event yesterday at Oakland.
Jakie doesn't appear able to do much
with any of the short-priced ones he
rides of late. Pretty soon his services
will not be in such big demand.
The Oregon mare was played down
from 8 to i to 13 to 10 and ran fourth.
She did not run her race. Sad Sam, a
7 to 1 chance, after cutting off and foul
ing almost the whole field on the far
turn slid in less than a length ahead of
Mansard in 1:00%. As the race was run
the latter sprinter should have won, for
when cut off by Sad Sam Davis had to
pull him up, losing at least three
lengths. The favorite lost show honors
to Martinmas.
FOUR OUTSIDERS WIN.
Outsiders captured the first four num
bers on the card, then two choices
reached home in front. The track was
in excellent condition and a large
crowd viewed the sport.
Mimo, the mount of Travers, had first
call in the betting in the opening six
furlong event, and the gelding finished
second to Mocorito. The latter mare re
ceived careful nursing at the hands of
McÃride, and coming from behind out
gamed the first choice, winning by
nearly a length. Hipponax finished a
close third, in front of The Cure.
There were fourleen starters for the
seven-furlong selling run. which fol
lowed. Suburban Queen looked the most
eligible, but Knapp could not drop the
mare in among the first three. The win
ner turned up in Karabel. a 13 to 1 shot,
which scored, ridden out, from Cinna
bar and Haven Run. Suburban Queen
died away after looking to have a great
chance.
ROBERT MITCHELL HAS SPEED.
Robert Mitchell, with Travers in the
saddle, made an awful showing of his
company in the six-furlong sprint for
three-year-olds. The Kismet colt re
ceded in the betting to 8 to 1 and then
went out and won in stake horse
fashion, scampering in nine lengths be
fore Sweet Kitty Bellairs, a 50 to 1
shot. Princess Zula, the 2 to 1 favor
ite, with Helgesen up, ran a fair
third.
A dozen cheap platers lined up in
the mile and seventy yard selling num
ber, .riugie, with Davip up, closed an
11 to 5 choice and with little in re
serve downed Adirondack less than a
length. McÃride finished third on
Rene, a3O to 1 outsider. Frank Woods,
the mount of Bullman, the opening
favorite, came in for steady support,
but the old horse appears to be all in.
After running two bloomers Smithy
Kane came out for a "fair dinkum"
in the concluding five and a half fur
long dash. The fireside folks had the
temerity to back the Texas halfbreed
to beat Prince Brutus, a 1 to 2 fav
orite, and the good thing nearly went
through. Smithy Kane unwound a ball
of speed which was much longer than
any one was led to suspect he pos
sessed. Jakie Jones, who rode the fav
orite, tumbled to this fact when the
stretch was reached and through dint
of hard work got the Prince up in
time to win by a neck. David Boland
was third.
TRACK NOTES.
The apprentice allowance of Travers
expires to-day.
Only a few days back Lee Blasinerame
lost Salable from a selling race, "Kan
sas" Price claiming the son of Sam
Lucas. The three-year-old started in
the first race yesterday with the Price
colors up for th<? first time, and after
finishing fifth was claimed by George
Wentworth, trainer of Mocorito, for
$Â«25.
M. J. Daly purchased Arcade from
Walter Jennings yesterday for $1000.
Puerl Wilkerson, now in Los Angeles,
claims to hold a contract oh the ser
vices of "Big BIN" Knapp, the jockey,
tVhich does not expire until March 26
next. The jockey's father affirms that
no such contract exists. Wilkerson
filed his claim with Judge Hamilton
of Ascot Park. Knapp Sr. and his son
left for Los Angeles last evening to
settle up the matter. Walter Jen
nings recently engaged Knapp to do
the riding for his stable, and he states
that even if Wilkerson does hold any
sort of a contract on Knapp it is null
and void, tor Wilkerson owes the
jockey 5200 in unpaid riding fees.
The Pacific Jockey Club allotted the
following dates at a meeting held yes
terday: Seattle, May 27 to July 19,
inclusive; Portland, July 22 to Sep
tember 16, inclusive. Kenilworth Park.
Petaluma, has two weeks, following
| the close of the season at Oakland.
Several touches have come off in the
ring since the season opened, and Dell
Fountain is the latest victim. Dell
started to make a bet on some horse
! yesterday, and while holding up his
J wager to a bookmaker the crook re
j lieved him of 5420 which he carried in
a side pocket. *
Robert Mitchell, winner of the third
j event, was bid up from $500 to $1200 by
j "Kansas" Price, owner of Sweet Kit
ty Bellairs, which finished second. Gill
j Summers retained the colt with the
usual $5 bid.
"Kansas" Price shipped Schoolmate
ito Los Angeles last night., The Wads
worth gelding will start in the stake
event at Ascot Park to-morrow, with
112 pounds up. Anderson went down
to ride him.
i Willie Harris and Jim Neil had? a
j wordy argument on the paddock lawn
; over the capabilities of Jockey W.
j Davis. Harris, who holds the contract
jon Davis, made a complaint to the
I judges about the remarks passed by
i Neil. Jim said a mistake existed some
\ where, and the matter blew over like
i many another race track muss.
Baine Wins Handball Tourney.
; The handball tournament at the Olym

WITHDRAWS ORDINANCE
RELATING TO CREMATION
Health Board Finds Proposed Measure
Conflicts With State LawâPer
mits Granted for Sanitariums.
The Supervisors' Health Committee
yesterday listened to Health Officer
Ragan and other officials of the
Health Department in support of the
proposed ordinance making it unlaw
ful to cremate the remains of any dead
person until they have been in a re
ceiving vault for at least thirty days.
Dr. Ragan said that the State law re
quires remains to be kept five days
before cremation and as the proposed
ordinance conflicts f with the statute
he asked to withdraw the measure.
This was allowed.
Dr. Ragan was heard regarding the
objections of the Health Board to the
establishment of a laundry at York
and Twenty-sixth streets and the rec
ommendation that soap factories and
tanneries be excluded from the district
near the swamp at Twenty-sixth and
Army streets. Ragan stated that such
industries were a menace to health,
owing to there being no sewer connec
tion. The committee laid the matter
over pending the making of some ar
rangement to connect the York-street
sewer with the Army-street sewer. The
Board of Works was asked to make
an estimate of the cost of the im
provement.
The committee was kept busy hear
ing petitions for permits to conduct
sanitariums and maternity hospitals.
Permits were granted to various in
stitutions that complied with the or
dinance, while a few that the com
mittee was doubtful about were taken
under advisement.
DEMENTED MAN OFFERS
FORTUNE FOR AN APPLE
Martin Britt Would Pay a Thousand
Dollars for Fruit, But Gen
erosity is Spurned.
Martin Britt, a demented but good
natured man walked up to Deputy
Health Officer Louis Levy yesterday
afternoon and demanded that Levy
sell him an apple for a thousand dol
lars. Levy was unable to accommo-
Sate Mr. Britt, but escorted him to
the insane ward of the Central Emerg
ehcy Hospital where he told his trou
bles. . 1
Among other things, Britt told
about a $50,000,000 deposit to his
credit in the Hibernia Bank, donated
to him by H. E. Huntington. He pre
sented a check for the amount and
when it was dishonored, he felt sore.
Britt will probably be sent to one of
the State hospitals for the insane to
day. He says his home is in Oakland.

COUNSEL CANNOT SHAKE
GALLAND'S TESTIMONY
Attorneys for George Monnier Elicit
Nothing New From Deputy
Sheriff.
The damaging testimony given by
Jesse Galland, one-time bosom friend
of George Monnier, who is suing for
a share of his father's estate, was
carefully gone over by Sullivan and
Roche, for the contestant, yesterday.
Galland's testimony as to the abuse of
the old man by George and the re
quest that he endeavor to get George
"shanghaied" withstood all technical
assaults by the lawyers.
During the testimony some personal
questions relative to the witness' con
nection with politics were asked, and
Galland said he had made money at it
in the past and stood pretty well at
present.
Miss Marie Labarcat and Miss Marie
Vidaillet, servants in the Monnier
household, told of the Quarrels and
bitter language occurring frequently,
and the latter witness said she had
seen George choke his father and
chase him with a butcher knife.
Mrs. Monnier was on the stand for
half an hour under a fire of questions
from Sullivan. She refused to tell her
age, and Sullivan insisted. George D.
Collins strenuously objected to her
answering, but Judge Graham allowed
the question, and Mrs. Monnier said
that she was born in 1847 and came to
California when she was 16. She tes
tified that she failed to remember
where she lived in San Francisco be
fore her marriage. The case will be
continued Monday morning at 11
o'clock.
COME FAR TO TESTIFY
IN A BURGLARY CASE
Four Army Officers Arrive from Fort
Snelling as Witnesses Against
Juan Sanchez.
Captains J. A. Pearce, E. G. Over
shine and I. J. Carr and Lieutenant S.
A. Price of the Twenty-eighth Infan
try arrived yesterday from Fort Snell
ing, Minnesota, to give testimony
against Juan Sanchez, a former Fili
pino scout, who is to be tried in the
United States District Court on a
charge of burglarizing the house of
Captain Pearce at the Presidio in
September. Sanchez was captured by
Captain Carr. On the person of the
prisoner was found the loot, consisting
of jewelry and valuables. He had en
tered several houses at the post.
Inasmuch as the crime was commit
ted on the Goverment reservation the.
prosecution devolved on the Federal
authorities. The cost of bringing the
four officers to San Francisco will
amount to about $1000, whereas the
total amount of Sanchez's, thefts could
not have been more than $250 j

switched again last night. Jimmy
Gardner does not feel disposed to come
all the way to San Francisco just for
the pleasure of a mere mix-up with
Gans. He informed Manager Greggains
of his decision by wire last night, and
the latter set about matching Frankie
| Neil, the bantam, with Tommy Murphy
of Philadelphia, and Dick Hyland with
| Billy Finnucane of Chicago as a double
! event in place of the Gans-Gardner go.;
The outlook for a "fight" has become
! quite a joke along the line. The news
! that the Gans-Gardner bout was off did
. not create a great sensation at that.
When the match was made last Mon
day night there were many who took it
as a joke, and still others declared it
was another deeply laid plot by which
Herford might get away with some
more California coin. Many of the wise
[ fraternity are sure the Gans-Gardner
match was made in Baltimore by the
wily Herford.
Gardner says in his telegram that he
has a fight on at Denver on the 25th
inst., and therefore could not get to
this city in time to go a few rounds
with Gans. No one seems to know the
true reason why the match was de
clared off, though Herford might have
had something to say about that, too.
Gans and Herford will come .right
through to San Francisco just as
though nothing had happened. They
do not seem to be the least bit afraid
of meeting a lynching party or a vigil
ance committee at the ferry. Their
mission here will probably be explained
when something- comes off and a big
wad of the public's coin finds its way
into their capacious pockets.
Murphy and Neil were practically
matched by Greggains last night. Both
boys say they are eager for a go, and
there seems no hitch in the proceed
ings. Murphy's manager is willing to
post a forfeit of $2500 and let this sum
go for a side bet. Neil says he is ready
to bet Murphy any amount he desires.
The Hyland-Finnucane bout was
not settled last night. Hyland is will
ing to go on, but no word was received
from the Chicago lad. He is rated as a
fast boy, having met such men as Tom
my Mowatt, Willie Mack. Tommy Sul
livan and others. Greggains thinks the
double match system will make a hit.
Both mills will be twenty-round affairs.
Morris Levy is trying to sign Nelson
and Young Corbett for a return bout
before the Hayes Valley Club in Febru
ary. It is almost an assured fact that
the match will go through. Corbett
wants to fight and is at present in
training. Nelson will be about ready to
talk business when he returns from his
hunting trip some few weeks hence.
The men will likely be signed at 130
pounds at 6 o'clock, the weight they
met at before. There is practically no
other match in sight for the promoters.

ARE GUESTS ON STEAMER
EXCURSION ON THE BAY
Delegates to the Master Painters' and
Decorators' Convention Visit
Many Interesting Points.
The delegates to the Master Painters'
and % Decorators' convention were
guests of a well-known wholesale
paint house on an excursion yesterday
around the bay. The party left the
Clay-street wharf early in the morn
ing in one of the bay steamers. All
the interesting points about the bay
were visited. The day was chilly, but
it did not have the effect of marring
the pleasure of the members. Plenty
to eat and drink added to the enjoy
ment of the party.
At the opening session of the con
vention Wednesday, at Red Men's
Hall, many interesting papers, dealing
with vital points of the craft, were
read and discussed.
At the session to-day many impor
tant resolutions will be brought before
the body to vote on., and it is expected
that some of them relating to existing
conditions will be adopted.
The following committees were ap
pointed:
CredentialsâO. X. Yeakle. Ran Francisco;
G. A. Dennis. Oakland, and C. B. Stllwell.
San Jose.

JEWISH WOMEN DEBATE
OBSERVANCE OF CHRISTMAS
Council Meeting at Temple Emanu-El
Listens to Able Papers on
Interesting Topic.
The Council of Jewish Women held
a, very interesting convention yester
day afternoon in the rooms of Tem
ple Emanu-El. The subject, "Should
We Celebrate Christmas in/ Our
Homes?" was ably and pointedly dis
cussed. Two papers, by Mrs. J. C.
Levey and Mrs. D. Hirshberg, were
favorably inclined toward the observ
ance of Christmas, stating that it in
no wise harmed nor interfered with
the Jewish faith. The negative was
emphatically upheld by Mrs. M. C.
Sloss and Mrs. Â«.M. Neumann, the
latter particularly protesting against
the introduction of Christian rites
into the households of Judaism.
Much enthusiasm greeted each
reader and the papers were excellent
in argument and reason.

the Republic, held a banquet and in

BERGER IS UNDER FIRE
Olympic flub Directors to
Dispose of His Case To-
Night at Their Meeting
The Supervisors' Police Committee
postponed action yesterday on the peti
tion of the Hawthorne Club to give an
amateur boxing exhibition on the 31st
inst. The committee decided to await
the outcome of the agitation raised by
the Olympic Club relative to the al
leged irregularities of boxers in violat
ing the amateur rules. The committee
cited representatives of all the ama
teur clubs to appear next Thursday,
when an inquiry into the alleged viola
tions of the rules will be commenced.
The Brooklyn Athletic Club, through
E. C. Harrington, manager, filed aft ap
plication to give a professional boxing
exhibition during March.
President William Greer Harrison of
the Olympic Club andr George James
and other officials of the Pacific Ath
letic Association will be among the
men who will endeavor to show the Su
pervisors the deplorable state into
which the so-called amateur boxing
has fallen in this city. While many
people know of the existing conditions
it is difficult to get them to testify,
especially as the promoters stand to
gether and deny that money is paid,
although it is a matter of common no
toriety.
The directors of the Olympic Club
will take up the Berger case to-night
at their meeting. Although powerful
influences are at work to save him, it is
expected the. resignation he placed in
the hands of the directors some months
since will be accepted. He claims that
at the worst he is in the same category
as Jimmie Britt, Eddie Graney, Phil
Wand, Young Mitchell and others who
are professionals and who are allowed
to remain in the club. He overlooks
the fact that charges of conduct preju
dicial to the best interests of the club
have been preferred against him, while
there is nothing against the others.
EMPIRE GUN CLUB ELECTS

B. Haver; captain, A. J. Webb; lieu

large membership and the apprecia
tion of the various duties performed
by each official. The same committees
were named by President Sweeney as
are at present handling the club's af
fairs, namely: Executive committeeâ
Dr. Gfyorge G. Gere, J. B. Haver, F. S.

CLUNIE ACCUSES
TWO EXECUTORS.
Objections to Account Are
Full of Charges of Mal
administration of Estate
INVESTIGATION BEGINS
.
Allegations Read in Court
and B. G. \Vhite Submits
to Kigorous Examination
Sensational r bjections to tbe aecourt
| ing of E. A. liridgford and Burrell G.
! White for their administration of the
million-dollar estate of the late Thomas
!J. Clunie were read in Judge Coffey's
court yesterday by Andrew J. Clunie.
' the third executor and brother 'of
the deceased. The written objections
bristled with the words "looting,"
; "misappropriation," "grossly false" and
| "illegal." and in the course of a search
ing examination of White, which was
unfinished at the end of the afternoon,
Mr. Clunie added "conspiracy" to his
; list of charges against the two txec
j utors.
! Bridgford and White were both in
: court and were represented in the pro-
I ceedings by Hudson Grant, former
! Juda;e at Woodland, whose employment
as attorney by the executors is one of
the chief grounds of Clunie's attack
1 upon the account. D. M. Delmas was
! also present, but his interest is in a
matter that will be taken up laterâ
that or his fee as attorney for the es
tate. In the examination of White
some of the questions were not gone
j into because of the absence of certain
receipts arid documents that he will be
required to produce in court on next
: Monday afternoon.
t'lunie especially excepts to certain
; items of receipts and moneys on deposit
that Mill be investigated when the rec
, ords are produced. These include
the distribution to Florence Clunie ol
$40.325 received from Andrew Clunie on
I the settlement of her contest. Andrew
jJ. Clunie says this was never paid to
j the executors as such, but was the
property of Florence Clunie, held by
I the trustees.
DISCREPANCY EXPLAINED.
An exception was made to the report
Of the sale of personal property for
$12,862 SO,-when the arriount was really
$19,480. White admitted that there was
a mistake in the entry, but said it was
explained by another entry for the sale
of sugar stock, whi< h covered the dis
crepancy. Objection was made to a
charge for the keep of a horse which,
Clunie said, was used by White "for
his private amusement and con
venience." White hotly denied this,
and at this point declared that the ob
jections were "blasphemous and out
rageous," and that he did not want a
day to pass without a full investiga
tion.
Exception was also taken to the pay
ment ot $150,000 to Mrs. Clunie under a
decree #f partial distribution on Feb
ruary 5 last, on the ground that "no
such decree was ever made and no such
payments could have been legally
made."
In examining White on the settle
ment of Mrs. Clunie's contest. Andrew
J. Clunie asked him if he had selected
John R. Wilson as Mrs. Clunie's attor
ney. He replied that he had only men
tioned him in connection with getting
an allowance for Mrs. Clunie. Clunie
brought out that White and Wilson
were warm friends, and then asked
why White had not employed him as
his own attorney. White declined to
answer, and Judge Coffey sustained his
objection, whereupon Clunie remarked
that he wanted to show that White
brought about all the trouble with Mrs.
Ciunie and sent attorneys to her.
Pursuing the same line he attempted
to go into the relationship between
White and Bridgford for the purpose,
he said, of showing a "conspiracy to
vote away the money of this estate."
White was very close to General Clunie
and attended to all his business. He
was present when the will was made
and read the items to the testator. This
led to a line of questioning upon
White's construction of a clause in the
will appointing three attorneys as
executors and instructing that the
three should choose one/of their num
ber to act as attorney ia the adminis
tration.
HIRED ATTORNEYS.
White said that he and Bridgford at
first thought that much legal service
would not be necessary in the adminis
tration, but upon Clunie's assertion
that there would be a contest of the
will they concluded to get assistance.
Bridgford wanted Hudson Grant to rep
resent him and White wanted W. H.
Robinson. Both were employed, Grant
preparing nearly all the papers in the
estate and Robinson passing on them
for White. A few weeks ago it was
agreed that Grant should have $8000
for his services and Robinson $2000.
These amounts were paid and Clunie's
objection thereto says: "It was wholly
unwarranted by law; paid without
services having been rendered in return
and paid and accepted with the full
knowledge that the payment constitut
ed a looting of the estate and a mis
appropriation of the money." Clunie
declared that the services were not
worth $500 and that the payments were
net for the attorneys, but were to be
shared by the executors. Questioning
White on this point and in regard to
the checks which were cashed at the
Western National Bank, of which
Bridgford is a director, Clunie said he
would demand an inspection of Grant's
private account at that bank.
It was further charged that the law
yers were paid out of the receipts from
the sale of personal property, permis
sion to sell which had been obtained
by representing that there were no
funds from which to pay legacies.
White admitted that the money was
so paid, and that he had told some one
that he had no funds to pay legacies.
Clunie also objected to an item of
$2500 "in the hands of E. A. Bridg
ford," and charged that it had been
paid as an advance on commissions,
contrary to the rule of the court. White
would not swear that this was or was
not true, but said there was an un
derstanding that the money would be
repaid. Clunie declared that there
should be no commissions, because
there was no labor in administering the
estate and "upon the grounds that the
executors have willfully misappropriat
ed the property of the estate."
Clunie said that D. M. Delmas was
employed as attorney for the estate,
according to the report, but he be
lieved he was employed by Bridgford
because the latter waa fearful of losing
his position as trustee.
Says Blasting Causes Earthquakes.
John F. English sent a letter to the
Supervisors yesterday stating that he
has been informed that the recent
earthquake shocks are really caused
by the blacting operations on the
Southern Pacific bay shore line.
English suggests that the blasting be
done in the daytime, so people can
sleep at night. -

HIS INNOCENCE
Denies He Passed a Raised
Bill Upon Mrs. Vallade to |
Pay for the Macaroni
SHE SWEARS 'TWAS HE
Prosecution Oifers to Prove
Defendant Was Once Ar-;
i
rested on Forgery Charge
Much contradictory testimony was
given yesterday before United States
Commissioner Heacock in the prelim
inary examination of Le Roy Lee,
charged with passing a $1 silver cer
tificate raised to $10 on Mrs. A. J. Val
lade. proprietor of a delicatessen store
at 114>_ Sixth street, on December 26.
Mrs. Vallade and her daughter Grace
positively Identified Lee as the man
who had passed the raised note. They
said he had been In the store several
times before that and had bought sev
eral articles.
Miss Grace Vallade told the court
that at 5 o'clock on the afternoon of
the 26th Lee and his wife came in and
bought 5 cents' worth of potato salad,
for which he paid with a 50-cent piece.
Lloyd Lee. their 12-year-old son, was
no-t with them. In fact Miss Grace and
her mother were positive that they had
never seen the boy until he appeared ir.
the courtroom. At half-past 6 o'clock
Lee had returned alone and bought of
Miss Grace 10 cents' worth of macaroni
cakes, giving her the bad 810 bill.
On the evening c-f the 28th she saw
him pass the store, and she and the
dishwasher followed htm until they saw
him go into 934 Howard street, where
he roomed. They then Informed Po
liceman T. B. Riordan, who. arrested
Lee.
Lee and his wife swore that they.
\Â« Hh the boy, bought two mince pies
and pome doughnuts on the occasion
reterred to and that Lee paid with a
$5 bill, which bill was genuine. This
bill Mrs. Vallade admitted having re
ceived but at an earlier date than the
one testified to. The boy. Lloyd Lee,
12 years old. swore that he saw his
lather give a $5 bill. In answer to a
question by Judge Heacock the boy
said he had not spoken with his
parents at all about the affair.
Judge Heacock remarked that there
was much contradictory testimony in
the case and that it came from the de
fendant and his family. "Under the
well known rules of law," he said,
"such testimony is to be received, if at
all. with very great caution."
W. D. Redington, wholesale druggist.
A. H. Vail of Sanborn & Vail and
Richard de Lancie. Deputy United
States Marshal, testified to Leo's good
reputation.
United States Secret Service Agent
George W. Hazen and Assistant United
States Attorney Charles M. Fickert
said they would prove by Police De
tective Gibson that he had arrested
Lee five years ago on a charge of
forgery. The hearing was thereupon
continued until 2 o'clock this after
noon in order that the detective might
be present and testify.

GARBAGE MEN
STILL IDLE
Mayor Schmitz Will Make an
| Effort to Settle Strike
at the Reduction Works
RESIDENTS INDIGNANT
Refuse Is Piled Up on Va
cant Lots by Oraer of
the City's Chief Executive
The big garbage crematory at the
foot of Eighth street looks like a de
serted fortress now. The huge piles
of garbage surrounding the place
makefit appear even more suggestive,
and the passerby who is ignorant of
ihe fact that a strike ia in progress
would suppose that these heaps of
rubbish were the breastworks of some
besieged army.
The people of the neighborhood are
up in arms against the city officials for
allowing the garbage to be dumped
near the crematory. But yesterday
they discovered there was no redress,
for the Mayor has granted the scaven
gers permission to dump the refuse
on adjoining vacant lots till the strike
has been settled.
A delegation of the men employed
in the crematory yesterday waited
vainly for Mayor Schmitz to tell him
their troubles. The Mayor will hear
the tales of woe of the men and the
officials of the crematory to-day and
bus already undertaken to straighten
out the trouble.
There was no riot at the crematory
yesterday. A squad of patrolmen par
aded up and down In the vicinity of
the place to keep order. Many of the
strikers were on hand to see what
would happen, but they behaved them
sehrSs and casually looked on, while
wagon after wagon drove up and
dumped its contents on adjoining lots.
The men say they will not go back
till the time clock is done away with.
They have taken a dislike to this piece
of modern machinery and vow they
WW have nothing to do with it. They
also want extra pay for overtime. The
off Vials Bay the demands of the men
will not be granted and that their
Pisces will be filled within the next
U w days.
In the meantime the garbage is fast
piling up in the vacant lots near the
crematory and residents of the district
are wrought up over the nuisance.
The foul smelling garbage is a menace
to the community and unless some
thing is done within the next fqrty
eight hours there is likely to be
trouble.
There are about twenty green hands
at present at work in the crematory.
These men cannot begin to handle half
the stuff that comes in, and, as the
scavengers insist on making quick
time, they simply dump the refuse In
some convenient place and hurry on
their way amid the abuse hurled at
them by the indignant residents of the*
district.

The Spring Valley Water Company
yesterday filed with the Supervisors a

of its properties in San Mateo, San

The Scientific Alarmist.
The plain citizen 1b booked for all
sorts of trouble if he takes with deep
seriousnessâa habit of the plain citi
zenâall we are hearing these days
about "Impure food." We learned that
our coffee is tainted with some kind
of an acid that just glories in chewing
up the nerves and membranes and fur- <
nishing physicians with new clinical
subjects for the paresis class. The oat
meal contains a liberal percentage of
sawdust secured from trees that grow
in a marsh where the original malaria
germ has its habitat. The milk is a si
lent partner of the typhoid germ and
the rolls are shortened with a lard sub
stitute made from cottonseed oil pro
duced from cotton that is full of boll
weevils. The man who dodges these
and other attendant evils at breakfast
and is allowed to live until dinner finds
prussic acid in his peas, strychnine in
his olives, deadly phosphates in the
soup, sure death in the cheese and
borax in everything. â Washington
Post. ,
Beds Teed by Soldiers.
The beds used by the soldiers of Ger
many and Russia are simple straw
beds, without sheet or mattress, on
which they sleep with a blanket or
over them. In Russia, till recently, the
soldiers slept with their clothes on, on
camp beds, but now the ordinary beds
are being put into use âthe result of
association with more civilized coun
tries. After this it cannot be doubted
that the French soldier's bed is the
best of all. He has a wood or iron bed
stead, a straw bed, a wool mattress,
sheets, a brown woolen coverlet and
an extra quilt for cold weather. Thus
the bed of the French soldier is the
softest of all soldier's beds, as the bed
of the French peasant is acknowledged
to be the best of all in European coun
tries.-!-Indianapolls News.
Shipments of anthracite coal from the ;
mines In the month of May aggregated
5,28Efc079 tons, which is larger than *.n
any month ever reported, except April
of this year and January of last year.
This heavy movement does not include
the usual volume of shipments by lake,
as lake navigation is largely suspended
on account of the strike, and the de
mand is still great.
ENGLISH AS RENDERED
IN PARLIAMENT
Some Curious Instances of Misuse of
Rhetorical Figures by
Numbers.
Curious Instances of a misuse of tropes
and other figures of speech by British
Parliamentary orators are not difficult
to find in any collection of speeches
from that source, according to the
Chicago Chronicle. Following are
specimens from what were probably
extemporaneous efforts:
"Sir, we are told that by this legis
lation the heart of the country has
been shaken to its very foundations."
"I am only too thankful that we
have removed one of those miserable
barbed-wire entanglements and that
we find ourselves in smooth waters at |
last."
"The Secretary of the Education De- J
partment was the father of a state
ment of which the bottom was '
knocked out by those who followed !
him in the second reading debate, yet j
the honorable member for St. Pancras 1
has thought fit to trot It out again." ' j
"Among the many jarring notes I
heard in this house on military affairs j
this subject at least must be regarded
M an oasis."
"The interests of the employers and j
employed are the same nine times out
of tenâl will even say ninety-nine
times out of ten."
"Our*ongues are tied, our hands are
fettered and we are really beating the '
! air to no purpose."
4*l will now repeat what I was about j
jto say when the honorable member in- :
i terrupted me."
I "The West Indies will now have a i
j future which they never had in the
past."
"A thorny subject which has long
bt en a bone of contention among, us." ,
"A slumbering volcano which at any j
moment a spark might set aflame."
"The Chancellor of the Exchequer |
has denuded us of every rag of the \
principles which we have been pro- ;
claiming from the housetops."
"Ah! The honorable member oppo- !
site shakes his head at thaL But he 1
can't shake mine."
Relief of the Poor.
During 1903 Great Britain spent more
than $61,000,000 fn poor relief. In vari
ous English towns there are now daily
processions, 500 to 1000 strong, of un
employed mens marching through the
streets demanding food or work from
the authorities. In Westham, near |
London, with a population of about i
200,000, 7000 or 8000 men, with families !
dependent on them, are out of work, j
In the United States, while conditions !
are not so bad, the pressure on chari- I
table institutions both public and pri- j
vate is steadily increasing. It is said
that there are more men "out of a j
job" in New York City to-day than i
ever before.
The grave fault of all these remedies
is, according to Mr. Champness, that
they .are aimed at the symptoms rather
than the cause of the disease. It is
like trying to cure a man with a can
cer by giving him opium to relieve the
pain. Society finds a certain number
of its members poor and helpless. It
puts its hand in the-"well-to-do" man's
pocket and takes enough to keep the
paupers from starvation.
Mr. Champness very reasonably con
tends that it could better afford to
spend its money in a scientific hunt for
the cause or causes of pauperism, and
if possible so amend its laws as to de
crease or do away with the worst forms
of poverty.âNew York Globe.
The Size of Texas.
"This will help you to figure out just
how large Texas really is. If you have
a star mathematician in your family,
tell him the number of square miles
there are In the big State, then tell him
the population of the globe; then ask
him if all the people in the world were
placed in Texas and its soil divided out
â Among them per capita, how large
would the man's farm be who had a
wife and two children? When he gets
through figuring, then wnlsper in his
ear: 'More than half an acre.' "âTex
arcana Courier.
Growth of Absentmindness.
There was a time when weddings and
funerals were looked upon as engage
ments which It was impossible to post
pone. Of late, however, the growing
laxity of the age has affected even
these. Menâand women, too âare be
coming so careless that they not only
put off the'r weddings, but now and
then miss the appointment. Some are
so incorrigibly casual that they would
be absent from their own funerals if
they had any volition In the matter. â

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan 5.âThers was little life
left in the stock market to-day and the senti
ment as expressed was thoroughly uncertain.
The fluctuations werr constant and the level
of the market shl'ted many times from an
average nigher than last night to a lower
, â¢ cne. Dealings were small snd were attributed
â¢ almost altogether to professional sources. It
was the common remark that there was no
evidence of public participation In the market.
The expected January investment demasid foil
ed to develop and the fear was thus engen
dered that whatever buying was to be ex
pected on this account had been Included In
the remember movement, which was attribut
ed at the time to a demand from dealers for
the purpose of stocking up for the January
investr..ent dtmand. The feeble downward
. moyerr.entf which alternated with the Indif
ferent advances were supposed to be due to
short-celling by traders to a large extent, such
as is the consequence almost invariably of a
dull and halting period in the buying of
0 stocks There was some natural reaction from
the stimulation caused by the fall of Port
Arthur and the Northern Securities decision
' and the tone of the discussion, both here and
. abroad was much less hopeful of a prompt
â â¢ peace 35 the result of the surrender of General
' â¢ Stoessel. Rumors of prospective railroad com
binations and absorptions still attracted atten
tion, but there was less confidence in the
universal tendency of the prospective changes
to harmonize thi railroad situation as a whole
and tbe possibility was canvassed of new
' rivalri-s being awakened instead.
SoriV effect was produced on sentiment by
â¢ rather censorious discussion of recent episodes
in making bank loans for stock market pur
poses, which have come to light in the pro
0 res* of liouidation. The criticism offered by
the New York State Controller In his annual
report of some banking and trust company
â¢ methods are given additional force by such
Further engagements of gold for
export added to the influence of that factor.
MonÂ»y. h"*?ver. continued extremely easy and
served as a safeguard against any pressure
tip'.n the stock market. The general list was
s Â«tained also by a number of points of posi
-trength. Amalgamated Copper bad the
' benefit of a further advance in the price of the
â¢ metal. The coalers proved the main stay of
' the market and it was the strong advance In
. the Eries that made the closing steady.
The bond market was very broad, but the
movement of prices somewhat Irregular. Total
â¢ ' sales, par value. S3.42n.000.
Cnited States bonds all unchanged on call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. s.âThe wheat market opened
firm, with May up a shade to %Â©%c at $1 14%
to $1 14%. The cash situstion in the North
west was the principal cause of the early
: strength. News from Minneapolis was quite
i bullish, a claim being made that 1.600,000
' bushels of wheat had been ordered taken out
'â â  cf ston to go to outside mills. In addition it
! was reported that elevator stocks there yes- â 
terday increased 125,000,000 bushels. Another
' bullish Influence was a cablegram from Ar
gentina stating that the wheat yield in Buenos
jAy res province was considerably below ex
! pectatlons and that general rains were inter
fering with late harvesting. Lower prices at
Liverpool, however, had a depressing effect
on the market here. Reports of the excellent
condition of wheat In the United States also
caused encouragement to bear traders. Many
of the pit traders were apparently bewildered
by the conflicting reports and remained inert.
As a result the volume of trading was rather
small during the flrst part of the day. Later
the market became more active and a firmer
tone developed. May sold up to $1 15%. Dur
ing the last hour of trading*, however, all of
the advance was lost on profit taking. May
acid off to $1 14%, cloalng %6%c lower at
81 14%.
During the entire session the corn market
was subjected to liberal selling by commis
sion houses. May closed at 44% c, a loss of
%Â©%c.
Oats were weak. May closed %c lower at
GOV.
Provisions were weak as a result of renewed
liquidation by local holders. At the close May
pork was down 10612% c, lard was eft 567 %c
and ribs were 2%Â©6 c lower.

Butter. Cheese and Eggs.
General dullness Is the complaint all along
the line, and Butter. Cheese and Egsjs all
show a downward tendency. Butter la about
%c lower and most houses are atill shading
the quotations to sell. Cheese has lately been
dragging and has had to give way %c. Ranch
Eggs have declined more sharply than either
Butter or Cheese and are still slowly accumu
lating, though receipts are not very large.
But as this Is the season of the year for thetn
to decline buyers are holding off In expecta
tion of still lower prices, which increases the
weakness. Store Eggs are meeting with a
better demand than ranch, as during the cool
winter months they are about as good and
are certainly cheaper.
Receipts were 40.700 lbs Butter, 530 cases
Eggs and 27,700 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The fruit market continued very quiet, trade
in oranges and other Citrus fruits being re
stricted by the unfavorable weather, and local
buyers were taking no more than absolutely
necessary for immediate requirements. Stocks
of Apples are steadily decreasing, and as the
receipts are very light the market remains
firm. There is nothing new to report in other
fruits.

POLICE BOARD
LURING THEM
Drs. Poheim and Drucker and
John O'Brien Are Strug
gling for Appointment
A PRETTY FIGHT IS OX
Mayor Favorable to Rela
tive and Friend, but Medi
cos Are Strongly Backed
A pretty three-cornered fight was j
j being waged yesterday for the Po- j
! lice Commissionershlp which becomes I
! vacant next Monday owing to the ex
; piration of the term of Police Com- !
' missloner Howell. The three men who |
appear to be the most formidable can- j
1 didates for the post are John O'Brien, j
I a salesman for Roth & Co., the j
j liquor merchants; Dr. Joseph Poheim
of the Board of Health and Dr. George
Drucker, former member of the Board j
!of Education and ex-member of the
j Grand Jury.
John O'Brien is a new Richmond in
! the field and is related to the Mayor
jby marriage. The Mayor is desirous
iof having a personal friend on each
of the municipal boards and com-
I missions, and the Police Commission
lis the only one upon which such is
I not the case. His Honor is very kind
ly disposed toward O'Brien and the
i family influence is being strongly ex- \
! erted in O'Brien's behalf.
On the other hand the friends of i
Dr. Poheim have not lost all hope ,
that he will be the next Police Com
missloner notwithstanding the Mayor's j
recent declaration that he would re- j
appoint Poheim on the Board of j
Health. Poheim has the backing of
Abe Ruef for the office and political |
pressure of the strongest kind is be- j
ing exerted in his behalf.
Then again the friends of Dr. \
George Drucker are making valiant
efforts to secure the plum for their |
favorite. In fact one of the political
powers acknowledged that Drucker j
has brought Influences to bear thati
cannot be ignored. Drucker is strong
ly backed by the "Horses and Carts," '
which wing of the Democratic party
has rendered good service to Mayor
Schmitz in the hour of need. This is <
the situation oh the Police Commis- j
sionership fight as it stood yesterday, j
although Arthur Dudley Cross and G. j
M. Roy are said to be still in the
j running.
Thomas F. Egan still seems to have
j the inside track for Commissioner of ;
j Public Works and things look rosy j
I for William H. Metson for the Park
l Commissionershlp. Commissioners
Altmann. Wreden, Voorsanger and
Rogers will be reappointed and Alex
ander O'Grady Is slated for secretary i
of the Police Commission.
Royal Arch Holds Installation.
San Francisco Lodge No. 2 of the 1
Knights of the Royal Arch held Its an

I Theodore Lunstedt was the presiding

report showed that there were more
than 1000 members belonging to the I
order and that there was $10,000 in
the treasury'- The next State conven
tion of the order will be held In Sac
ramento in April of this year.

BLANCHE BATES
AS PLAYWRIGHT
Accomplished Actress Ap
pears in Own Clever Come
dietta "3ly Aunt's Advice"
PLAYLET FULL OF FUN
Versatility Shown in Her
Production at Same Mati
nee of "Madame Butterfly"
Blanche Bates made her debut as
I playwright yesterday afternoon at the
Grand Opera-house, when her come
dietta, "My Aunt's Advice," written in
collaboration with George Arliss, was
1 presented. The piece is in one act and
j highly amusing, though it fails to con- I
' vince. The story is a good one, but !
i the vague drawing of one of the three
I characters concerned makes it largely j
implausible,
j Mr. and Mrs. Middleton, married j
three months, and Dick Richards, a i
i guest of the house for the same length |
of time, are discovered. Mrs. Middle- j
ton is tired of the situation and is de- j
sirous of getting rid of the intruder
in the conjugal tete-a-tete. The stu- j
pidity and rudeness of the friend âMr.
Ormonde makes him both stupid and
rude in the beffhiningârenders Mrs. j
Middleton's desire explicable. Her hus
band's desire for his continual com- i
pany is less easily explainable. Mr. and
' Mrs. Middleton have "words'* about the j
i man. But Mrs. Middleton has an aunt j
! who knows things. To her the young ;
j wife has confided the situation. Louisa j
J âthe auntâadviseB a flirtation with the
I gentleman after the manner of a cer- i
j tain chapter by Le Sage In the "His
| tory of Gonzales." This by letter.
Mrs. Middleton, seeing that her hus-
I band is Impossible of conviction, pro- i
I ceeds to take the advice of aunt. She J
! confesses, a la Gonzales, an overpower- j
; ing passion for her husband's friend, i
i bidding him "Fly!" Very funny is the
| friend's reception of the announce- |
| ment as done by Mr. Ormonde, still j
1 as the stupid though now polite friend.
He promises to fly. with a delightfully J
â  complacent glance in the mirror at his j
fatal beauty. But after Mrs. Middle
too has left the room he picks up and .
; reads Aunt Louisa's explanatory let- ]
ter! Here he becomes the cad. Then j
j he plans revenge in a humorous and j
! Imaginative fashion quite at variance j
! with what has heretofore been seen of j
j him. That kind of man would not .
I have been third in a honeymoon.
Still, when Mrs. Middleton returns,
and Richards, whom she had thought
gone, returns to make a burning dec
laration of his hidden passion, in
phrase a la Dumas the younger, the
situation is distinctly hilarious. Mean
time her husband has demanded an ex- j
planation of his friend's departure. !
Mrs. Middleton has insinuated Rich- !
ards* guilty passion. Middleton then
follows the supposed would-be de
stroyer of his peace. He returns to find
Richards In the middle of his mock;
declaration. But why Mr, Richards j
should imagine that Middleton would j
see through the pretense gets me. The
curtain, however, goes down on Mrs.
Middleton with her head on Mr. M.'s |
I shoulder and Richards waving them
a valedictory adieu. Yet one laughed all
j through.
Blanche Bates, as Mrs. Middleton.
was welcome in her good American
gown, again looked charming and did j
I everything for the part. Mr. Or- >
monde also did what he could and Mr. j
McGrane as Middleton filled in satis
factorily.
It was a far cry from this to the
"Madame Butterfly" that followed, the
"Madame Butterfly" with which
Blanche Bates has been so famously j
connected. Anew, the play touched, de- j
lighted, thrilled. It is a little classic,
and Miss Bates' Cho Oho San a thing j
of sheer beauty. The actress was un- J
fortunate yesterday in Baby Gertrude !
Slavin's defection. A small yelp from j
the wings was all of Miss Slavin that
made its appearance. The piece was j
played without "Baby Trouble," and
those that have seen it will understand j
the unfortunate difference.
But Miss Bates was a delight
throughout. Her performance was !
cameo-like in Its finish and fine- j
ness. Yet there was color, exquisite
color. She realized with happiest In
stinct the tielicate pathos, gayety, ra- !
cial charm of the character. Its touch
ing patience, sweetness, faith, dignity,
delightful coquetry were all pictured
with a. sure and admirably reserved
art. But one forgot the art In the ex- .
quislte humanness of the portrait. It'
was not Blanche Bates before us, but a j
little butterfly of a "Japanese wife." !
who happened to have a soul. We gave
tears to her grief, and as many, per- j
haps, to her pathetic faith in the man
that had deserted her. You will hardly ! 1
find a thing more artistic, more subtly
realistic, or more charming than Miss ;
Bates' Madame Butterfly. ! <
Ada Lewis was a distinct addition to
the illusion as Suzuki, the maid; Mr. !
Ormonde's Sharpless was wholly in the
picture, and Albert Brunlng, as the ',
would-be Japanese husband, was a sat- \
Isfying brown man. The American
wife, with Miss Leslie Preston, came
Just as crudely as It always does. But, i
then, that was not Miss Preston's fault I
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Dice Throwing for Cigars Legal.
A â¢ misconception having arisen in
the minds of some policemen as to an
ordinance published in the Police I
Bulletin last Tuesday regarding shak
ing dice for money, Chief Wittman in | '
yesterday's issue of the Bulletin ex- ' !
plains that the ordinance does not ap- ,
ply to shaking dice for drinks or cl- J i
gars. Some policemen had notified j :
saloonkeepers on their beats that they t
must not allow shaking dice for drinks ' '
or cigars and the Chief expresses sur- j i
prise at their stupidity in so constru- â¢
ing the ordinance.

A LOVELY COMPLEXION
New York Lady Proves That
Every Woman May
Have It By
USING CUTICURA SOAP
Mrs. R. Reichenberg, wife of the
well-known jeweller Fulton St.,
New York, says: "I had a friend who
was justly proud of her complexion.
When asked what gave her such a
brilliant and lovely complexion, she
replied, 'A healthy woman can be sure
of a fine akin if she will do aa I do,
use plenty of Cuticura Soap and
water.' She insisted that I follow her
example, which I did with speedy con
viction. I find that Cuticura Soap
keeps the skin soft, white, and clear,
and prevents redness and roughness."

California Viticultural Club
Petitions Authorities to
Help the Young Industry
The California Viticultural Club held
an animated meeting yesterday with
the idea of taking steps to protest
against the proposed internal revenue
tax on sweet wines, which Commis
sioner Yerkes has recommended in his
annual report.
A set of resolutions embodying the
protest was drawn up and copies were
forwarded to the President of the
Senate and to the Speaker of the As
sembly at Sacramento with the re
quest that the same be adopted by
both branches of the Legislature. The
resolutions follow:
Whereas, Commissioner Yerkes of the In
ternal Revenue Bureau, In his annual report
to the Congress of the United States recom
mends the it-vying of a minimum tax upon the
grape brandy now used in the fortification of
sweet wine manufactured within the United
States amounting to 25 cents per proof gallon,
and which tax Is equivalent to not less than
5 bents per wine gallon on the sweet wine
manufactured; and
Whereas, California being essentially a grape
producing State and the largest producer of
sweet wines manufactured within the United
States*, and
Whereas, The imposition of such a tax would
work incalculable Injury to an Industry In
which there la Involved over $80,000,000, and
which amount was invested with the Inspira
tion that the sweet wins laws of the nation
would be continued In their Integrity; and
Whereas, The Industrial business Interests of
California, In conventions assembled, have
strongly protested against such a tax, declaring
that Its Imposition will virtually destroy the
sweet wine Industry of California, and have
appealed to the Legislature to strengthen the
protests an a Inst such a tax; therefore be it
Resolved, That the Senate and Assembly
of the State of California concur In these ex
pressions of opinion and recommend Cali
fornia's representation in Congress to ener
getically oppose the enactment of such a meas
urc, and further to petition the President of
the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, to
veto any law levying such a tax, as an enact
ment of that character would injure the busi
ness Interests of California many millions of
lollars and wipe out the viticultural interests
vt this State and retard the State's progress,
while no material Increase can accrue to the
revenue of the General Government by ths
Imposition of a tax upon sweet wines manu
factured within the United States, as the busi
ness from which such tax Is expected will
sntlrely disappear; and be it further
Resolved, That the Governor of the State
jf California. George C. Pardee, be and he
s hereby requested to have transmitted to
he President of the United States, to each
Senator and Congressman representing the
State of California in the national Congress
i copy of this petition st the earliest pos
ilble moment.

Rector of St. Paul's Church Suffering
From Indisposition, but His Con
dition Is Not Serious.
The Rev. W. M. Reilly, rector of
St. Paul's Church, California street
near Fillmore, has been indisposed for
some days and since his sermon on
j Christmas day has been confined to
his room.
On Christmas eve the Rev. Mr.
j Reilly was the recipient of a
j beautiful gold watch, which was pre-
I sented to him by Miss Beatrice Fife
jon behalf of the parishioners. Ac
-1 companying the watch was a parch
ment, on the upper corner of which
is a water color miniature of St. Paul's
Church, designed by Harry Hedger,
bearing the inscription: "Presented to
Dr. William Maxwell Reilly this
Christmas eve, December the twenty
fourth, in the year of our Lord nine
teen hundred and four, by his parish
ioners in token of their esteem and af
fection."
Mrs. Reilly last night said that the
Rev. Mr. Reilly was much improved,
although still confined to the house.

wines manufactured. California is the
leading sweet-wine-making State in
the Union. Sherry and port are the
leading wines In this production.
Sherry is largely used by druggists in
compounding their medicines and is
also largely used for medicinal pur
poses. Brandy is one of* the prominent
factors in the production of these
wines.
BRANDY IN SWEET WINE.
About three-fourths of. the brandy
produced in this State is used in the
production of sweet wine. Brandy is
taxed at the rate of $110 per gallon of
the alcohol contained in it. For the
purpose, however, of aiding the domes
tic sweet-wine industry, the statute re
mits the tax on brandy used in forti- i
fying sweet wine. In his recent reDort.
however, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue recommends the reimoosition
of the tax on brandy used in the man
ufacture of sweet wines, or at least that
there be collected a minimum tax of 25 j
cents per proof gallon of the alcohol in |
the brandy.
Winemakers say that this would re
sult in a tax of $1,000,000 per annum. ;
and this young industry at its present '
volume cannot stand it.

GADSKI CHARMS
WITH VARIED
PROGRAMME
The second of the Gadski .recital
drew an even larger audience than th'
first to the Alhambra last evening
Both were more than good for the tim<
o' year. Last night's programme lacke<
much of being as the first evening's
Naturally, also, the singer was not ii
quite the inspired mood of Tuesda:
night. But when the gods give us Gad
j ski in any mood we may be thankful.
By the way. My bad script is doubt
less responsible for my being made t<
say in Wednesday morning's criticisn
that Gadski's voice lacks power. Wha
I did say was that Gadski's highei
notes lack fullness and quality. Per
haps this was even more discernible
last evening, one feeling the voca
strain when there was any demand foi
climax in the far upper range. It seemi
that since her appearance here in open
these notes have somewhat suffered
but there is a corresponding gain ir
the remarkable beauty of the lowei
compass. But it is a beautiful voice
and how she is blessed In its use!
Gadski did not begin really to "sing'
last night until her encore to the sec
ond group of songs, the "Still as th<
Night." The usual aria from "Samsor
et Delila" preceded this, handsomelj
enough sung. She gave then a grouj
of Brahms lieder, that included thÂ«
"Feldeinsamkeit," the lovely "Vor,
Ewiger Liebe," and the "Slumbei
Song"âcharmingly given. Part second
of the programme was devoted tc
American composers. Perhaps it was
this that rather indisposed the singer!
They were not our best songs, though,
Madame,and they came humbly enough
between Brahms and Wolf. Parker's
"Hora Novlssima" is, however, an aria
to arouse patriotism. It is a splendid
song and was admirably treated by the
singer. Hammond's "Cupid Wings"
was rather amazing fare on a Gadski
programme, and amazingly, also, was
encored. The Rider-Possart "Christ
mas Night" followed. Then came
MacDowell's "The Clover" and a simple
and charming little ballad, "Airly Bea
con," also encored. Nevin's "Night
ingale Song" followed and was encored,
After that Madame began to sing!
Her "Still as the Night" was adorably
sung, palpitating with the essential
musical thrill. So was the Wolf "Ver
borgenheit," the delightful "Kinder
li*der" of Taubert with their artless
humor; the two Strauss songs, "Traum
Durch die Dammerung" and "Caecilie."
She was finally encored and gave a
stunning "Erlkonig," though not with
quite the breathless sweep of the
Tuesday evening rendering.
Mr. Meyrowitz showed himself again
the miraculous accompanist. I have
never seen him betteredâdon't know
how he could be. And it is very good
fun to hear him direct Wamer at the
piano. It was the "Meistersinger"
prelude last night, and mighty interest
ing in its orchestral grasp. The Satur
day matinee will be all Wagner. Gad
ski and Wagner! How's that?
