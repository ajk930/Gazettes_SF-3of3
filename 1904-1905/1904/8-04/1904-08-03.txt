Despite these declarations of the
packers' representatives, the pens at
the stockyards are filled with cattle
and hoes that buyers make no bids
for in the market. According to com
mission men and officials of the Union
Stockyards and Transit Company, out
of the livestock received yesterday and
to-day more than 19.000 sheep and-10,000
hogs were reshipped, and unsold stock
is rapidly accumulating in the pens.
Twelve thousand hogs remained un
sold to-night, and the prospect of
large receipts to-morrow is causing
the livestock handlers to fear a swamp
ing of their facilities. According to
commission men, there are thousands
of holdovers in all departments of the
yards, and the cattle in the peris' will
not all be out of the way by Saturday
night. In the face of all this shippers
are constantly forwarding , stock to
Chicago, and indications to-night are
that there will be a decided slump in
the prices of the stock.
This assertion was made by Meeker
to-night after the packers had brought
in during the day, according to their
estimates, 1300 new men. Another of

that at the time the same bears date
and at the time when it is alleged that
said instrument was signed and exe

of a sound and disposing mind and was
not competent to make a will."
Â¦ The uncle asks that the will be not
admitted to probate and that it be de
creed that Bertha Dolbeer died intes

j The contest filed by Attorneys Wells
and Tauszky is in behalf of Frazier M.
Dolbeer, Jane Ann Brown and Alice H.
Fern of Brooklyn, and Stephen Dol
beer of Queens County, Xew York.
After reciting that Miss Dolbeer died
without issue, husband, father, mother,
brother or Bister, the paper gives up
the relationship of the contestants in a
way which leaves it in doubt. It is
said that the father of John Dolbeer
was Nicholas, long deceased, and
"Moses Dolbeer was one of the broth

CHEFU, Aug. 3, 1 1 a. m. â A
desperate three days' assault upon
the inner defenses on the northern
and eastern sides of Port Arthur
has failed, according to advices
brought by two junks, which ar
rived here to-day. A Russian
who escaped from Port Arthur,
via Pigeon Bay, on the night of
July 29, says that the earth
trembled under the terrific can
nonading, which began at 4
o'clock in the morning of July 26
arjcl ended during the night of
Tuly 28, when .the battle ceased. A
Chinese* who -ihas "arrived 'here oh
a separate junk confirms the Rus
sian's statement, that Russian
killed and wounded during the as-,
sault numbered between 5000 and
6000. The Japanese, in their re
peated assaults against the east
ern forts on the hills, through
barbed wire entanglements and
Over mines, displayed fanatical
bravery. They were mowed down
by the hail of shells and bullets
and the explosion of mines under
their- feet. Their losses are esti
mated at 20,000. The Russian
declared that the Russians held all
the eastern forts leading to Gold
en Hill and that the Japanese,
shattered and exhausted, retired
to the eastward.
As related by the passengers of
the two junks, the Japanese ad
vance, which began from Kwo
kau before daybreak on July 26,
was directed against Kikwan,
Kinkitun, Kinkishan and Pchtou
shan forts, lying: near the shore.
The Russian outposts were driven
back. In the meantime Admiral
Togo shelled the forts at long
range, but the return fire of the
forts kept his ships at a safe dis
tance* rendering the co-operation
of the fleet ineffective.
On the morning of July 27 the
Russian fleet steamed out, keep
ing under the protection of the
Golden Hill guns. The Russian
vessels did not fire upon the Jap
anese and soon returned to theii
anchorage.
The assault Â¦ on the northern
side of the city occurred on July
27. The Japanese left at Hsikau
advanced on the Russians at
Shinshiying^ but were repulsed.
The junks were within hearing
distance for three, days after leav
ing, but no more firjng was heard.

ing Qualities of the Japanese, and as
he saw the fighting on the Yalu he
ought to know. Regarding the opera
tions of the Vladivostok squadron, he
says the Japanese Government has re
ceived information which goes to show
that the so-called Norwegian whalers
are acting as scouts for the Vladivostok
ships.
These whalers have been observed
several times cruising in parts of the
Sea of Japan, where no whales are
found, and their movements northward
and southward coincide strangely with
the movements of the squadron.
Several Tokio journals allude to the
matter and express the opinion that
their work may explain the safety with
which the squadron so far has eluded
pursuit. Some action will be taken by
the Government.
The transportation and commissariat
arrangements have been excellently
carried out, and practically the plan of
campaign has been followed without
modification, and eo far with complete
success.
The Empress saw nothing of the Rus
sian ships, although there was kept a
close lookout.
j '
Davis expressed the opinion that the
Japanese officials have entirely misun
derstood the status of the foreign war
correspondents, and is doubtful wheth
er those in Tokio will ever get to the
front, although when he left Tokio they
had been assured that they would leave
Bakan for Port Arthur on the 24th ult.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 2.â Oscar
King Davis, the noted correspondent of
the San Francisco Call and the New
York Herald, arrived here on the Em
press of Japan this morning from the
Orient. Davis is among the more for
tunate of the foreign war correspond
ents, in that he saw a good deal of the
actual fighting and was not shut in
Tokio all the time awaiting the fulfill
ment of official promises. He is looking
in fine trim and says that he has had
some very interesting experiences.
Shantiakow is situated on the rail
road leading from Port Arthur to Kin
chou and is between Ingentzi Bay and
Victoria Bay, but is closer to the for
mer than to the latter. Roughly speak
ing, Shantiakow is about ten miles
from the actual fortnes3 of Port Ar
thur. It is a position of {,-reat natural
strength, commanding a broad plain
leading to Wuchiatun, another strong
position on hills about four miles from
the .fortress. ,
TOKIO, Aug. 2.â It is reported here
that after three days of desperate
fighting the Japanese have captured
Shantiakow, one of the important de
fenses of Port Arthur.

To deepen the mystery, she has pa

through them she had drawn an an

wears and no clear idea as to why she
came here.
The Marine Hospital surgeon at
tached to the Immigration Bureau de
clares the woman is deranged. The
surgeon of the steamship which brought
her here asserts positively that she is
not. He talked with her on every day
of the voyage and on every subject
and found her perfectly rational. But
on the representation of the Marine
Hospital surgeon the immigration au
thorities refused to allow. the woman to
land and would have removed her to
Ellis Island had it not been for pro
tests of the steamship officers, who
said that the fair voyager was too deli
cate and refined to be penned in with
a lot of immigrants, and that, since she
had been barred from landinsr and
would have to return by the shiD that
brought her, they would care for her
on board ,the ship if the officials did
not object.
No objection was made and- the
woman is now on board, well cared for.

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 2.â It is
reported in well-informed circles that
Muravleff, the Minister of Justice,
will succeed Von Plehwe, " late Minis
ter of the Interior.
N. V. MUravieff, the Minister of Jus
tice, is 'a brother of the late Count
Muravleff. who, when Minister for
Foreign Affairs, died -suddenly on June
21, 1900. He was born in 1850. and,
with his brother, the late Minister of
Foreign Affairs, was greatly instru
mental in the transformation of the
Russian penal system and in utilizing
the vast resources of Siberia. The
Minister of Justice is a nephew of the
great Count Muravieff-Amurskij, the
hero of the Russo-Turkish war of
1828-29, and who in 1831-32 took a
prominent part in suppressing the
Polish insurrection.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GENEVA. Aug. 2. â Russian police
have evidence, that the assassination
of Von Plehwe, Russian Minister of
the Interior, was planned in Geneva
by a central committee of the Dorje
vaya organization and that the death
of the Czar also was a part of the
plot.
Confederates of the assassin have
been traced to a villa close to the
French frontier, on Lake Leman,
where the details of the crime were
'arranged. The leader let it be sup
posed that he was a retired French
tradesman named Duval. The mem
bers of the committee approached the
villa in small boats disguised as fish
ermen, early in the morning. A high
wall about the place insured secrecy.
The Swiss and French police sus
pected that all was not right about the
villa and held it under surveillance.
The only trace of the Thea in the
maritime records available is that she
is of 934 tons register and that she Is a
German vessel which had been trading
In the China Sea. . .." -
The steamship Schinau, from Austra
lia for Yokohama, was inspected and
released. On July 25 the Thea, a Ger
man vesel of 934 tons register, "with a
full cargo of fish from America to Yo
kohama, was stopped. She was re
garded as a legal prize and her crew
was taken off and the vessel sunk
owing to the impossibility of bringing
her to a Russian port."
On July SO, near the northern coast, a
Japanese third-class cruiser and sev
eral tcrpedo-boats, taking the same
course as the Russians, were sighted,
while on the western coast near the
Tsugaru Straits a coast defense battle
ship hove into sight.
"All these ships," Admiral Jessen
says, "kept far astern of our cruisers,
and after two h/mrs they turned away.
The .Russian squadron suffered no loss
In men and no damage, and there was
no loss of life on the vessels sunk or
taken."
The news of the return of the Vlad
ivostok cruisers from their third suc
cessful raid considerably lessened the
feeling of despondency created by Gen
eral Kuropatkin's telegram to the Em
peror admitting the necessity of his
retreat. Vice Admiral Skrvdloff's re
port of the cruise points out the utter
inability of the Japanese warships to
follow up the three Russian cruisers.
The Japanese were apparently unable
to spare a single effective ship to cope
with them. The few antiquated ves
sels encountered by Rear Admiral Jes
sen were unable to give chase, and the
torpedo-sboats were shy In approaching
the Russians.
It is presumed that the steamship
Thea, although flying the German flag,
was chartered by an American firm.
In view of the fact that she sailed
with a cargo of canned fish, it is con
sidered not unlikely that, like the
Arabia, she sailed from Portland, Or.
Two Japanese schooners were sunk.
Then Admiral Jessen fell In in quick
succession with the British steamships
Arabia and Knight Commander. Of
the Arabia he says nothing new.
"The Knight Commander only stopped
after the fourth shot," the admiral re
ports. "Her cargo being railroad.ma
terial, undoubtedly contraband for the
belligerent party, and not being able
to bring her to the nearest Russian
port, owing to her not having enough
coal, without manifest danger to the
squadron, we sank the Knight Com
mander after taking off all her crew
and removing her papers."
Two more Japanese schooners laden
with salt were then sunk.
With the cruisers Rosslay, Gromobol
and Rurik, Admiral Jessen left Vladi
vostok on July 20. After sinking a
small Japanese vessel the cruisers held
up the British steamship Camara, but
as she had no cargo and "was not
caught In the act of carrying contra
band of war we were compelled to let
her go," says the dispatch.
A Japanese coasting steamship was
next met, but "as most of her fifty pas
sengers were women we determined to
release her."
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 2.â In a
lengthy telegram to the Emperor, Vice
Admiral Skrydloff relates the doings of
the Vladivostok squadron under Rear
Admiral Jessen.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 2.â It is
sure that at present a battle is going
on for possession of the Liaoyang main
road. Kuropatkin himself is in the
midst of the lighting. It was stated to
day that the general staff had received
news that the commander in chief had
been wounded by a bullet in the arm.
Allowing tor the inevitable conflict in
names, the Japanese and Russian re
ports seem to agree on the main points
of the military developments up to
August 1, but both gtop short at their
interesting point, namely; regarding
what occurred on August 2, when it is
possible ft decisive struggle was pro
ceeding east and south of Liaoyang.
It is evident from Kuropatkin's dis
patches" and the Japanese reports that
the Russians abandoned Yangse Pass,
falling back upon Liandlansian, a
strong defensive position in the hills
twenty-four miles southeast of Liao
yang.
General Kuropatkin admits that there
were heavy losses along the Siamatsza-
Liaoyang road on July 31. The official
account is somewhat inconclusive, but
indicates that although the Russians
withdrew from their advanced posts
Kuropatkin hoped to be able to hold
his main positions, even in the face of
the superior Japanese force, and that
he evidently expected heavy fighting
along this line, probably at Anping.
This battle was practically proceeding
on August 2, although the dispatch re
ports that all was quiet up to noon of
August 1.
In the meantime a serious enveloping
movement of three Japanese divisions
was maturing around the Russian left
at Haicheng. where there was also
heavy fighting on July 31.

J TOKIO, Aug. 3, 10 a. m.â The Japa
nese defeated the Russians at Torau
cheng (Slmoucheng) and drove them
toward Haicheng in a sharp fight,
j which began last Saturday and ended
on Sunday. The Russians left 1500
dead on the field and lost six guns.
The Russians occupied a range of
high hills north of Tomucheng (Simou
cheng). which were strongly defended
with covered trenches, fortresses and
covered emplacements, which con
sumed mtrntha in constructing.
The Japanese seized a range of
heights to the southward on Saturday.
They began the attack at daylight on
Sunday. The Japanese left wins en
countered severe opposition. The Rus
sians were gradually reinforced, and
their artillery was increased to twen
ty-one {funs. The Japanese, who were
also reinforced, renewed the attack at
3 o'clock in the afternoon and drove
the Russians northward. The Jap
anese right, exposed to a severe ar
tillery fire, was forced to halt.
The Russians, who were reinforced,
assumed the offensive at 5:30 o'clock in
the evening, but were repulsed with a
heavy loss. The Russian artillery pre
vented the Japanese from pursuing
and during the night the Russians
withdrew toward Haicheng. The Jap
anese casualties were about 400.
General Kurokl has telegraphed that
j in the two days' fighting at Yanprtze
| ling and Yushulintzu his losses were six
j officer* killed, sixteen officers wounded
and 950 men killed and wounded
TOKIO, Aug. 2 (Noon).â General Ku
roki has administered a severe defeat
to the Russian forces which defended
the Russian east flank at Liaoyang,
winning separate actions at Yushu
likzu and at Yangse Pass. These two
places are twenty-six miles apart, but
the two actions were fought at the
same time. The Russians held strong
positions. The thermometer registered
more than 110 degrees Fahrenheit and
the soldiers suffered cruelly from heat
exhaustion.
At Yushulikzu the Russians had two
divisions of infantry and some artil
lery, and they resisted the Japanese
assaults vigorously.
Both attacks were begun at dawn
of Sunday. July 31. At Yushulikzu the
Japanese carried the Russian right and
left wings, but on account of 'the
strength of the main Russian position
they were unable then to press the at
tack. The two armies rested on Sun
day night, facing each other.
At dawn of Monday the Japanese re
sumed the attack and by noon they
had dislodged the enemy and driven
him four miles, to Laoholing.
At Yangse Pass also the Japanese
were successful. Their artillery opened
on the enemy and the infantry
moved forward from Makumeza. The
attack at this place was made at 1
o'clock on Sunday, and by nightfall the
Japanese were in possession of a ma
jority of the Russian positions, al
though the enemy had resisted with
determination.
The Japanese forces passed the night
in battle formation and another as
sault was made on Monday at dawn.
By 8 o'clock on Monday morning
Yangse Pass and the surrounding
heights had been captured.
General Kuroki explains the slow
ness of these actions by saying that
the difficult topography of the battle
fields made it imposible to secure good
artillery positions and that the great
heat fatigued his troops.
The Russian force at Yangse Pass
was estimated at two and one-half di
visions and four batteries of artillery.
The enemy retreated toward -/Tang
hoyen.
General Kuroki reports the capture
of some field guns, but the number Is
not given. The Japanese casualties
are being Investigated. /

Evidently the shock caused several
cracks in the walls of the crater, for,
during the night, there were cave-ins
on the east and south sides of the pit.
Walls heretofore of an angle of 50 or
60 degrees are now .perpendicular. The
lava flow and cones are covered by
about fifty or sixty feet of debris. The
hot cracks are much hotter and the
crater itself is perfectly clear, no
steam or sulphur fumes escaping at
all. If this lack of smoke continue
there Is apt to be an explosion and
outbreak shortly according to the old
natives, who profess to know.
HONOLULU, July 27. â On Sunday,
July 17, at 2 p. m. quite a seismic
visitation came to Hilo and vicinity,
waking the inhabitants from their af
ternoon siestas and tumbling pictures
and bric-a-brac in a heedless manner.
The quaking was slow and steady,
vibrating about thirty-three seconds,
with a period in the middle of about
five seconds of genuine jolting. Houses
and trees could be seen'swaying to and
fro and considerable damage was done
to property. The shock was felt at
the volcano house, which was rather
unusual, as most earthquakes that
strike Hilo are barely felt at the vol
cano.

REMOVING AX ANCIENT

Oustom-House Built of Coral In Days
of Kamehameha HI Being:
s Torn Down.
HONOLULU. July 27. â Another
landmark of the days of the Hawaiian
monarchy will disappear, as the old
custom-house Is being torn down to
make way for business improvements.
It was built in the period before the
lava rock came to be used as a build
ing material and is constructed of
coral blocks cut from the reef and
carried with great labor by men to the
site. No steam cranes or electric
elevators were in use in the days of
Kamehameha III and every one of the
heavy coral blocks was lifted into
place by human hands, yet so well was
the building constructed that it Is as
good to-day as the day It was built
and has taken much hard labor in its
demolishment.

SAN JOSE. August 2.â This city has
a thief with a penchant for coffins. In
the past month he has stolen more than
a dozen, valued at about 52500. The
caskets were taken from the ware
house of W. L. Woodrow.
A short time ago a certain casket
was missed from the warehouse and
"Woodrow decided to take in inventory
of his Btock. This revealed the* start
ling discovery that many of the finest
coffins and caskets were missing. Three
of the caskets were of oak and satin
lined, and retailed at $325 each. The
others were valued at more than $100
each. It is believed that the coffins
were carted away at night. They were
in the original boxes and had never
been opened. The warehouse is lo
cated in the heart of the city. There
are stores adjoining the wareroom and
a family lives in the second story of
the building.
"vVoodrow reported the. matter to the
police and for several days Detectives
Pickering and Prindiville have been at
work on the case. As yet they have
been unable to find where the coffins
have been shipped. The San Francisco
police have also been called In on the
case and the records of burials in that
city are being gone over to see whether
the stolen coffins have been used. It is
said that the boxes are numbered, and
through this It is hoped to find a clew.
In this city an effort Is being made
to ascertain the style of coffin used at
the funerals lately held, and the in
timation Is made that a number of
dislnterments may be made If the proof
is strong enough that one of the stolen
caskets were used.*

MILWAUKEE. Aug. 3.â Isaac Lee
Nicholson, Episcopal Bishop of Milwau
kee, bitterly denounces Bishop Potter
for his action in dedicating the "sub
way tavern" in New York. Bishop
Nicholson says it is something of which
every church will be ashamed and feel
the deepest humiliation. He said: "In
my opinion Bishop Potter's whole con
nection with the affair has been dis
graceful, and I am personally deeply
humiliated over his work. I have no
regard whatever for this particular sa
loon. It is a bad business all the way
through. It is not the first time Bishop
Potter has offended. His attitude on
moral questions is never high."
â¢ :
NEW YORK, Aug. 2.â Bishop Henry
C. Potter delivered the principal ad
dress to-day nt the formal opening of
"The Subway Tavern," a model saloon,
which was established by a number
of leaders in the reform movement
of the city; The purpose of the pro
moters of the. enterprise Is to serve
pure liquor and food at low prices uq
der the best possible moral conditions.
In his address Bishop Potter said the
keynote had been struck by this at
tack on. the liquor situation. He said
he believed In - the old village tavern
as a meeting place, where a long 1 even-
Ing could be spent without the neces
sity of intoxication.
"I belong to a dozen clubs," he said.
"If I want to go out to a dinner or a
social evening, I can do so in any one
of these clubs. But what of the man
who lives in two rooms with five small
children? He has no club. To get his
glass of beer with his luncheon he
must go to the saloon. This is the
greatest social movement New York
has ever known. \Jt is a movement
every one of- you must take into ac
count If you would save the repub
lic."
Bishop Potter concluded by wishing
every success to the movement.
The formal opening ended by sing-
Ing the Doxology.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Aug. 2.â John
C. Hoagland of McKittrick was shot
by Beverly English and Instantly killed
last* night at 10:30 in a camp near the
beach at Cayucos. Although an in
quest was held to-day no explanation
of the affair could be obtained, there
being no eye witnesses to the shooting.
English had lived with the Hoagland
family for the past three years. The
party arrived at Cayucos about i
o'clock yesterday afternoon from Mo-
Kittrick and pitched their tent among
other campers.
As near as can be learned, after
spending the evening together in the
Cayucos saloons the two men went to
their camp and quarreled. English
shot Hoagland twice with a 22-caliber
rifle.
Mrs. Hoagland heard the men quar
reling: when they arrived and heard her
husband order English out of the camp.
The shots quickly followed, but in the
darkness little could be seen. English
gave himself up as soon as he could
find an officer. After the inquest he
was brought to San Luis Obispo and
lodged in Jail.
The Jury, after listening to the testi
mony of eleven campers, found a ver
dict of death from gunshot wounds.
Mrs. Hoagland has several children
with her and has come to San Luis
Obispo with her camp outfit. English
is a young man and a brother of Un
dertaker Robert English of Arroyo
Grande. Hoagland was an old man,
while his wife is quite young.

JERSEY CITY, N. J.. Aug. *;â
Jeseph Campbell, a member of . the
company attached to No. 3 fire truck.
was killed last night by the explosion
of a fire extinguisher which he had
taken off the truck to use at a fire.
It is supposed that in taking the

together the acid and carbonater of
soda it contained and thus produced
combustion, the force of which blew
out the bottom of the cylinder. Â¦>
SANTIAGO DE CHILI. Auff- 2â The Unit*

There are contests in only three of
the four Assembly districts. In the
Forty-sixth District E. K. Strowbridge
of Haywards has no opposition. Oppo
sition to P. M. Walsh, incumbent in the
Forty-eighth District, has been stilled
and he has the field to himself. J. A.
Bliss will probably succeed himself in
.the Fiftieth, though a local Super
visorial fight cuts in at this point. W.
H. Waste will go back in the Fifty
second District. In the Forty-seventh
District in Alameda, R. B. Tappan is
making a fight against J. Clem Bates,
the present Representative. The pre
diction in. that city is generally of
Simpson for Senator and Bates for the
Assembly, as against Taylor for Sena
tor and Tappan for the Assembly. In
.the Forty-ninth District there is a de
cided fight on between J. J. Burke and
Morris Flynn. It Is understood that J.
W. Mott, present Representative, will
not again be a candidate. . In the Fifty
first District R. H. E. Espey and C. G.
Dodge are candidates.
. . There is only one fight jn the Super
visorial field. C. F. Hof ner will be re
nominated from the Fifth District and
H. D. Rowe from the Fourth District.
In the Fifth District there Is a fight
between John Mitchell, George E. Ran
dolph and George Fitzgerald. Mitchell
has most of the leaders of his district
behind him and the Indications are that
if Fitzgerald runs it will be with the
Union Labor nomination, which he can
have for the asking, leaving the fight
for the Republican nomination between
Randolph and Mitchell. ? â¢
An enthusiastic meeting of the Sec
ond Ward Republican Club was held
at Milton Hall to-night to* indorse the
renomlnation of Supervisor John
Mitchell. The club, 200 strong, received
his name with cheers and voted unan
imously to work and vote, for his nom
ination and re-election to office. His
candidacy was given hearty support
by Attorney C. E. Snook, Councilman
Elliott, Police Judge Mortimer Smith
and others and upon primary day every
member of the club will use all his in
fluence with friends to gain their sup
port of Mitchell's candidacy.
BERKELEY, Aug. 2.â The South
Berkeley Republican Club held a meet
ing last night in Lorin Hall and list
ened to impromptu speeches. Dr. W.
M. Rowley acted as chairman. A com
mittee consisting of R. C. Staats. R. A.
Nickel and Thomas Stevenson was ap
pointed to arrange with the Berkeley
Republican Club for delegates to the
County Convention. A special meeting:
of the club' will be held next Monday
evening.
The campaign in Alameda County is
moving apace as the time for the pri
maries approaches. Local political
clubs are being organized and old ones
revived; candidates are announcing:
themselves, and there are many indi
cations of approaching political strug
gles.'
Not many officers will be balloted for
this year in Alameda County, rhe leg
islative ticket and three . Supervisors
constitute the county ticket this year.
While there is great interest in the
State at large in the United States Sen
atorial question this subject Is the least
referred to in Alameda County affairs.
The Senatorial question apparently
has little to do with the very few con
tests for Republican legislative nomi
nations, in every case the contests be
ing of a purely local character. i
Three Senators will be nominated,
one for the unexpired term of J. R.
Knowland. who will be the nominee for
Congress to succeed Victor H. Metcalf.
In the Thirteenth District J. G. Mat
tos Jr., at present an Assemblyman, has
no opposition. In the Fourteenth Dis
trict W. M. Simpson is pitted against
former Senator E. K. Taylor for suc
cessor to Mr. Knowland. This contest
is a local one between two factions of
the party. In the Fifteenth District G.
R. Lukens will undoubtedly succeed
himself, though there has been some
talk of an opposition candidate who has
not yet materialized.

"W. S. Melick, secretary of the State
Board of Examiners, has begun an ex
pert examination of the accounts of
various philanthropic institutions in
this neighborhood which are recipients
of State aid. This work inaugurates
a semi-annual inspection of all such
institutions in the State. >
Secretary Melick shows that 8530
orphan children are partly supported
by the State, which makes an annual
appropriation of 5512,000 for the pur
pose. -In Oakland and its environs
there are five orphan asylums or chil
dren's homes that receive State aid.
The amounts disbursed to these In
stitutions are as follows: Fred Finch
Orphanage, $11,000; Beulah Orphanage,
$2000; Golden Gate Orphanage, $2000;
Ladies' Relief Society Home,' $5500;
West Oakland Home, $5600.
These inspections will be carried on
as a check upon impositions which
Melick says are practiced by parents
on the homes. He declares that many
half-orphans are sent to the asylums
when either a father or a mother -is
amply able to support them.
Melick announced that of the school
bonds recently sold by Oakland the
State Board of Examiners had
purchased $320,000 worth at par, using
State school land funds to pay for the
securities.

1016 Broadway, Aug. 2.
Division No. 53 of the Order of Rail
road Telegraphers, which is the division
of that order covering the lines' of the
Southern Pacific Company, has followed
the recent moves of President Harri
man in consolidating his railroad in
terests, and hereafter Division No. 53
will include all of the Harriman lines
west of Green River, Wyo., New Or
leans, La., and south of Portland, Or.
An order has just been issued by Grand
President H. B. Perham of the Order
of " Railroad Telegraphers from his
headquarters at St. Louis notifying W.
K. Davidson of this city that from Aug
ust 1 his jurisdiction as chairman of
Division No. 53 would include not only
the old Southern and Central Pacific
lines, but also the Oregon Short Line,
the Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company and that portion of the Union
Pacific between Ogden, Salt Lake and
as far east as Green River. This makes
Division No. 53 the largest in the
United States, both in point of mileage
and membership.
This change in the jurisdiction was
made in order to facilitate Davidson's
handling of the work of the order.
When Harriman divided his railroads
into a number of sections under gen
eral managers he changed the old junc
tion points that bad existed for so
many years. At Salt Lake City W. H.
Bancroft was given charge of the old
Central Pacific Railroad from Sparks,
New, to Ogden, and of the Union Pa
cific Railroad from Ogden to Green
River, and also of the Oregon Short
Line, while to E. E. Calvin at Portland
was given the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company in addition to his
lines of the Southern Pacific Company
in Oregon. Perham decided that the
work of Davidson upon this coast was
so satisfactory and his relations with
the official of the company were so
cordial that he would add this new ter
ritory to his jurisdiction, which may in
time extend over the entire Union Pa
cific system.
The headquarters of Division No. 53
is in this city, with Mr. Davidson as
the head and D. W. Koppikus as the
secretary. The divisions of the order
that formerly existed upon the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company's
lines and upon the Oregon Short Line
have been discontinued. The new divi
sion has over 2000 members.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
101C Broadway, Aug. 2.
The fire broke out early this morn
ing. There were ?only two people in
the house, / and they easily escaped
with their effects. As the fire alarm
system is not working in that section
yet, it was a long time before the fire
department could be summoned. Even
when the apparatus did arrive it was
useless, because the hose was not long
enough to reach the fire from the first
hydrant. All the firemen could do
was to let the building burn down.
Hugh McCall conducted the hotel.
The damage will be about $5000. There
is almost, enough insurance to cover it.
. The Bath Beach Hotel, a familiar
landmark in West Berkeley, blazed Its
way to a glorious death by fire last
night, and all the pioneers of the dis
trict saw the withered old frame ex
pire in the flames. It used to be the
San Pablo schoolhouse in the long
ago, and the people who knew it then
were sorry to see it fall a victim to
fire after serving its country so many
years.

era and wholesalers â organize and
work together for the common good.
On these lines a committee of three
was appointed to act with a like com
mittee from the American Wine Grow
ers* Association looking toward the
affiliation of the two organizations.
Another resolution was passed
thanking the Department of Agricul
ture for Its efforts to eradicate vine
diseases from the vineyards of Cali
fornia.
It was also the sense of the gather
ing that the Legislature be waited
upon and reauested to appropriate
525,000 for the investigation of vine
diseases, the sum named to Include the
expense of retaining for a period an
expert to be brought from the wine
districts of France. The Rege'nts of
the University of California were also
requested to take action that would
permit a professor of the university
to go to France and study the meth
ods in use there for treating vine dis
eases.
Resolution Is Adopted Urging That
Growers, Buyers and Dealers
Form New Organization.

The Department of Justice at Wash
ington is evidently not disheartened by
the decision of Judge Laeombe of the
United States Circuit Court in New-
York discharging John A. Benson of
New York from indictment for conspir
acy to defraud the Government out of
public lands. Francis J. Heney, who
was special Federal counsel before
Commissioner. Heacock in the long pre
liminary examination of Frederick A.
Hyde and Henry P. Dimond, Benson's
alleged coconspirators, received a tele
gram jfesterday from Attorney General
Moody announcing that an appeal from
Judge Laeombe's decision would be
taken without delay to the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals. The
telegTam also directed Heney to go
ahead vigorously with his proceedings
for the removal of Hyde and Dimond
to Washington, D. C, for trial.
The motion for removal will be heard
by Judge de Haven in the United States
District Court on August 15. It is the
intention of the defendants'. attorneys,
Messrs. McEnerney. Wheeler, Schles-
Inger and Knight, to insist then upon
the point made with success by Ben
son's counsel. J. C. Campbell, before
Judge Laeombe, namely, that the in
dictment found by the Federal Grand
Jury against Benson, Hyde et al. failed
to set forth facts constituting an of
fense under the laws of the United
States, and that if a crime was com
mitted It was against the States of
California and Oregon.
It Is reported here that attorneys
connected with the Department of Jus
tice who have read Judge Laeombe's
opinion are convinced that the New
York jurist failed to apprehend the
Government's position, and that the
higher court will reverse his ruling.
The defendants' counsel, however, are
equally confident that the decision will
stand.
On the hearing before Judge de
Haven, Mr. Heney will be assisted by
A. B. Pugh. an attorney of the Interior
Department, who will come on from
JVashington for the purpose. y

to Push the Proceedings
Against Hyde and Dimond
The people of Sausalito rebelled at
the ordinance, refused to pay and even
threatened to have the Trustees arrest
ed on the ground that they exceeded
their authority and that the ordinance
was illegal. The Trustees met in spe
cial session last evening to instruct the
Marshal what course to pursue regard
ing the people who refused to pay the
tax.
Trustee Martin read a letter from At
torney Henry McPike of San Francisco,
who had been consulted about the or
dinance. McPike was of the opinion
that the ordinance was valid and could
be enforced. The Trustees therefore in
structed the Marshal to wait on all in
coming and outgoing boats and collect
the tax from those who should pay.
This evening Frederick Marriott was
accosted by a deputy marshal as he
came off the boat and was requested to
pay the tax, but Marriott refused. The
Marshal swore out a warrant for his
arrest. The warrant probably will be
served in the morning and Marriott will
be brought before Judge Prior. 'ZC'l
SAUS.ALITO, Aug. 2.â A warrant was
sworn to this evening by Deputy Mar
shal Pariser for the arrest of Frederick
Marriott, editor of a weekly paper in
San Francisco, for refusing, to pay the
annual street poll tax of $1.
The Board of Trustees of the town of
Sausalito at a previous meeting passed
an ordinance that all male inhabitants
of the town of Sausalito between the
ages of 21 and 60 years^ should pay an
annual street poll tax of 51. The or
dinance provides that all persons re
fusing to pay the tax are guilty of a
misdemeanor and are liable to arrest.
Those dilatory are subject to a fine not
exceeding $200 or a month's Imprison
ment, or by both 1 such fine and impris
onment.

COURT-MARTIAL. STIXIj
IX SESSION AT PRESIDIO
"Twin" Sullivan was the main event
yesterday afternoon out at Jack Mun
roe's training camp. When the sports
learned the "Twin" was carded to put
up his mitts, they all hied themselves
to the beach in order to get a line on
the latest from New York and also to
watch Jack Munroe go through his first
day's work.
Munroe started In by pulling the
weight machines a little and taking a
few hard wallops at the punching and
the sand bags. He worked up a good
perspiration and felt just like going
a few rounds when Sullivan got ready
to mix it some.
The pair started in easy and worked
up gradually till they began to land
a few hard ones toward the end of the
second and last round. Sullivan showed
himself to be a shifty one and a man
who knows how to give and take a
punch. He- has a good wallop in each
hand and was always ready to mix
it with the miner when the pair came
to close quarters.
Andy Gallagher took on the miner
for. iwo rounds. Andy danced around
and shot in an occasional punch now
and then. The miner was always
watching, however, and he was there
with a few quick comebacks. He
landed a couple that made Andy wince,
and his work showed the long rest has
not made him as rusty as some were
led to believe..
Â¦ Gallagher and Sullivan also donned
the mitts for a round and the specta
tors liked the go so much that a de
mand was made for more. Munroe
took Sullivan for a swim, and the pair
went out bo far that the crowd thought
they had been swallowed by sharks.
Munroe is playing the swimming game
pretty strongly. He spends much time
in the water and many of the knowing
ones think he is liable to overdo this
stunt.
The miner will continue to box and
will go through his regular work every
day now till he is ready to face Jef
fries. He probably will retain Andy
Gallagher and Sullivan as his sparring
partners. Trainer in Chief Tim Mc-
Grath ha? abandoned the idea of col
lecting ambitious young men to don
the mitts with the miner. He has
come to the conclusion that a couple
of fast boxers is all that is needed to
give the miner practice.
JEFFRIES IS AFTER DEER.
Tlie Biff Champion In Still in the Wilds
of Lake Comity.
HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 2. â
Jeffries is not expected to return from
his hunting trip until 'Thursday.
Owing to the fact that the big fellow
i3 inclined to be somewhat careless
every one will be relieved when Jeff
returns unscathed.
Billy Delaney returned from San
Francisco yesterday afternoon and al
though Jeff left during his absence
Delaney fully approves of the cham
pion's trip in quest of game. Tne
veteran trainer feels confident that
two weeks' work will put the cham
pion in fine form. Upon Jeff's return
the hard work will begin in earnest.
Delaney ia partial to several days'
tramp in the hills as a great condi
tioner.

ROSENFELD SUES PIONEER
AUTOMOBILE COMPANY
Complaint Filed and Taken Out by
Attorney â Other Actions to Be
Besrun To-Day. *
Yesterday afternoon a suit for an
injunction was filed by Attorney "Wat
son for Max Rosenfeld against the
Pioneer Automobile Company and a
moment later, after the complaint had
been given its proper number in the
files; it was removed, ostensibly for
presenting it to one of the Superior
Judges for an order. Neither the
complaint nor the order was returned
to the County Clerk's office up to clos
ing time last evening and the allega
tions in the suit could not be learned.
Mr. Rosenfeld last night said that
he contemplated several actions
against the automobile concern and
that they would all be filed within
twenty-four hours. He professed not
to know which suit had been started
by his attorney yesterday or why the
complaint had been removed, unless
perhaps the particular point Involved

Rosenfeld indicated that the publi

ends of justice in giving some person
not named a chance to leave the city.
The nature of the suit filed and of the
others contemplated he declined to

blind man, who was sellingr pencils."
The thought of the poor, blind man

Â¦ The Commuters mixed It with Uncle's
men yesterday at Idora Park, Oakland,
' and the home team proved to be Buffer
ing still from that ancient 4 to 1 score. ,
They could not get away from it. They
made one in the first inning and then
<jult, while Oakland annexed the cx
.tra three easily, principally with the
aid of passes and errors.
Buchanan should have made it a
blank, but an error by Brick Devereaux
" in* the opening round g-ave Uncle his
â¢ mite. Jones had no control nor could
â¢ he deceive the Oakland batsmen when
runners 'were on the bases. Neither
team played good bail, Dunleavy's
clever work in the left garden being the
only feature to * outshine the rough
work. - t
Miller was passed by Buchanan in the
first round, and Hlldebrand popped up
Â¦ "a Texas leaguer" to right field. On
this the Rabbit sped around to third,
and came in when Brick Devereaux
: - made a wide throw to first after receiv
"ing" Ganley'e throw of Hilde's hit.
."â¢The lead was maintained till the
fourth, when the Commuters began to
"strike their prait. Dunleavy inaugurated
.the rally -with a three-baser to center.
"Streib brought him* in by rapping the
bait over second. Devereaux hit and
. Byrne? walked, filling 'em all up. Mc-
Kune lined a hot one to Miller and the
Rabbit quickly rut off Byrnes at sec
.ond. He whipped the ball to first, but
ircKune' just nosed it out. Then Jones
.â¢and Gorton began to make a roar to
â¢ the umpire. While they were engaged
â¢in showing him where he was wrong
â¢ Devereaux -stole in from third amid the
rear from the Oakland fans.
Francks â¢ bumped the ball for two
Eacks in the seventh, and started to
â¢ steal while Ganley was at the bat. The
hit and run signal was passed, but
.Ganley failed to hit, fanning on a wide
Â¦<5ae. Francks, however, kept on travel
ing and .came in when Irwin allowed
Gorton's low throw to go through him
anQ aw&y out to left field.
Uncle tried out Shortstop Charles
Swain, from the San Jose bush league.
The youngster has the size and the
physique,, but he looks a trifle slow on
bis p'ins for short. He was a bit
nervous with the stick, though in the
Â¦ ninth round, he rapped out a pretty sin
i gle to center.
Jack O'Connell umpired his first game
here thjs season, and the fans gave him
"the Joyous salute when he stepped Out
into the middle of the lot. The score:

IUTNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
The game itself was a long drawn out
pitchers* battle of fifteen innings, with
honors about even between Roach and
Overall. The fielding of both teams was
at times spectacular and at others
ragged. The score:
Tortland â . . , .Tacoma â
All went serenely until the last half
of the llfteenth, when McCreedie made
a long drive into right field. A specta
tor picked the ball up and threw it to
Casey, who in turn threw the ball to
third base, and McCreedie, who had
been coached to keep running by the
cry of '"blocked ball," was fielded out.
Portland immediately claimed the
run, but Thomas refused to allow it,
and declared McCreedie out. This in
cited the ire of the bleacheiites, and
they swarmed into the field after the
umpire's scalp like' an army of. ants.
Thomas headed for the gate. Seeing
that there was bound to be trouble
Manager Dugdale of Portland rushed
out into the field and either by a mag
netic power of pacifying: or his reputa
tion as a "rough-house" fig-hter suc
ceeded in making the spectators over
look the offense, and the embryo riot
ended in a fizzle.
PORTLAND, Aug. 2.â The Portland
fans became enraged this aXternoon
and came within an ace of sending
Mr. . Thomas, one of Alike Fisher's ar
tistic' twirlers, off the field In an am
bulance. McDonald, the regular um
pire, failed to appear at the appointed
hour for the set-to between Tacoma
and Portland, and Messrs. Butler of
Portland and Thomas of Tacoma were
electtd substitutes.

HEAL.DSBURG, Aug. 2- â Before
leaving for the East to-day. Ralph
Rose, the world's champion shot-put
ter, succeeded in throwing the 16
pound hammer during a private trial
the remarkable distance of 173 feet S'i.
inches, thus breaking the newly estab
lished world's record of 173 feet 4
inches, made by Jo-hn Flannlgan last
Saturday, by almost six feet. Rose
made a throw of 191 feet 1 inch about
two weeks ago.
Rose, who is only 19 years of age,
weighs more than 230 pounds, having
gained considerable weight since his
arrival on the coast.' He recently put
the 16-pound shot a distance of 47 feet
8 inches, which does not equal hi3
world's record of <8 feet 7 inches, but
beats his coast record of 43 feet 6\
inches by quite a margin. As he has
practiced but little with the shot, his
performance shows him to be in good
condition to go Into active training
for the St. Louts games, which he is
to enter as captain of the Chicago
Athletic Club's track team.

SARATOGA, Aug. 2.â Of paramount
interest to turfmen to-day was the per
formance of J. R. Keene's Delhi in the
last race of the day, a handicap at one
mile. Uoon his work in this race de
pended his chances of winning the 550,
000 Great Republic on Saturday, in
which he will meet Hermis, Waterboy,
Mercury, Knight Errant, Bryn Mawr,
Grey Friar, St. Valentine and possibly
The Picket.
In to-day's race Delhi met Hamburg
Belle, Grey Friar. Fort Hunter, Gold
Money, High Chancellor and Pennant.
There was a decidedly heavy plunge
on Hamburg Belle at the last moment,
causing Delhi's odds to recede.
At the start Hamburg Belle was 'last
away. In his anxiety to make up lost'
ground Jockey Lyne made too much
use of his mount, in addition to which
he ran into a pocket . directly on the
heels of Fort Hunter and Grey Friar,
causing him to take Hamburg Belle
back for a moment. By this time Del
hi's lead was some three lengths, 'and
it now seemed hopeless for Hamburg
Belle. The light-weighted Grey Friar
kept pegging away, and as the field
turned into the stretch partisans of
Delhi began to manifest great uneasi
ness, as Redfern seemed to be riding
him hard. Iledfern whipped the colt,
but Grey Friar steadily gained. The
best he could do, however, was to go
to Delhi's neck. Summary:

â¢ In e\^ry 'other respect the Ohio
pr.oyed herself equal to the exacting de
mands made uv.on her by the trial
board! She handled' like a yacht and
kri.swered her helm when going full
cpeed astern almost as perfectly as
Tvhen steaming straight ahead. She left
Fanta' Barbara at Â£:50 o'clock Monday
evening, and during the night encoun
â¢t^rtd a stiff head wind and high sea,
which. served to test her qualities as a
eea boat. She behaved splendidly, and
Captain Logan, v. ho is to command her,
eays she is as f.r.Q a battleship as ever
came off the Vays of an American snip
'yar<3.
That the Ohio can be made to fulfill
the 'speed requirement of the contract,
dnd even surpass it, is the unanimous
of all who participated in the
trial. The readjustment of some of the
rx&lvea and possibly a change of pro
peller* would be the only alterations
: necessary. " " "â¢ .".
The ne\y battleshir) Ohio, in spite of
the fact that she lacked on her official
triil a fraction nf the speed for Â¦which
ltÂ»r contract calls, is said to be "all
right" in every respect. She arrived
-Jtsterday afternoon from Santa Bar
brirg. an.d is now anchored off the Un
ion Iron Works.
.' It has not yet been decided whether
or not the Ohio will be jriven another
trial. The expense .of taking the big
Bshtlcg machine to Sanla Barbara in
trial trim and putting her through the
kir.4' of paces a navy trial board ex
acts is abtjut $75,000. The amount of
penalty 'deducted I by the Government
from Jhe cost to offset the fractional
-shortcoming in the matter of speed
wiD be conriderably less than $75,000.
IVwouId be cheaper. for the Union Iron
AVorks to pay the penalty and turn
over the battleship to Uncle Sam, but it
may be decided to go to the greater
cost fcr the purpose of maintaining the
builders .prestige

JUDGE Â»E IIAVI3X METES
OUT 3IERCY AND JUSTICE
SENTENCED FOR GRAND LARCENY. â
Alphonse Peterson, convicted on a charge of
grand larceny by a Jury In Judge Dunne's
court, was sentenced yesterday to serve five
years In San Quentln. There are two other
complaints againrt him and his attorney asked
that they be stricken from the calendar. The
Judge said he would tal;e the application un
der advisement. Peterson stole several shot
suns and rifles from a gun club In Solano
County on January 23 and iold them in this
city.
The heart of United States Immi
grant Commissioner North was touched
yesterday morning when Lew Ah Mon,
a pretty Chinese girl of 19 years, hung
about the neck of her father, Lew Fong
Yoo, and mingled hex tears with his.
The display of paternal and filial af
fection moved the Commissioner, and
he allowed the yellow maiden to be
landed.
Lew Ah Mon arrived at this port by
the steamship China, and her father
was waiting to receive her. It was said
that she had left this city, her birth
place, in 1900 and had remained In Chi
na ever since. But her photograph at
that age did not greatly resemble her
now and further proof was required.
She then said that while here she had
known an Irishman named Torn, that
he was florid o* complexion and fiery
of hair and beard. As the name of
Thomas Bethell, formerly a police ser
geant, was on her father's certificate
as one of the witnesses. Mr. Bethell was
sent for. He was then shuffled up with
about a dozen other persons and the
girl was brought into the room. She
at once identified Mr. Bethell as the
"Tom" sha had known, but she said
that she was not sure. Mr. Bethell said
that she looked about the eyes some
thing like the little Chinese child that
he knew. Then the girl's father was
shuffled up in a pack of a dozen other
Chinamen, and the girl at once threw
her arms around his neck and they
both wept for joy.
Commissioner North shed a sympa
thizing tear and Deputy Schell made a
transparent feint of blowing his nose.

Paris, always nervously eager in her espousal of the
bizarre, is translating the words of coon songs into
French. Let us congratulate our trans-Atlantic friends
upon the fact that this new freak of their fancy is at
least temporary insanity and harmless. We have tried
to translate these alleged songs into English and happily
have recovered. \" *â¢
Managers of Berlin music halls have made a plea for
public patronage by introducing pantomime instead of
music in their orchestras, the players fiddling, but giving
no sound to charm either the savage or the gentle breast.
The innovation is strikingly worthy. As a substitute for
most of what we receive in our restaurants and music

Udnunki, the ancient Adab, perhaps
the oldest city In the world, has been
discovered by the university of Chi
cago's excavating expedition in Baby
lonia. This city has for many years
been the object of search by oriental
ists. It is mentioned in the code of
Hammurabi, an early King of Baby
lonia, which document was translated
recently by Professor Robert F. Har
per, director of the expedition. He has
just received news In a cablegram
from Professor E. J. Banks, field di
rector of the expedition, who since
leaving this country last winter for
Bismaya, in Babylonia, has announced
many important discoveries. The un
covering of ancient Adab is one
of the most important archaeological
achievements In recent years. Dr.
Banks informed Professor Harper that
he had found bricks bearing the sylla
bles Ud-nun-kl at the lowest level of
the ruins.. He is certain that these
bricks Identify the city as Adab. With
a force of 12Â» men he excavated the
ruins at Bismaya, and found .the re
mains of four temples, built one above
the other, which he named according

TEMPLARS â Subscriber. City. Al
bert G. Mackey, in, his dictionary of
Masonry, one of the standard works,
has a long dissertation on the subject
of "Is the plural of Knight Templar
Knights Templars or Knights Tem
plar?" In conclusion he says: "All the
American and British writers. Masonic
and unmasonie, except some recent
American ones, use the plural of Tem
plar to designate more than one Knight.
I have In a few instances found Knight
Templars, but never Knights Templar.
The very recent American use of that
plural is derived from the authority'of
the present constitution of the Grand
Encampment of the United States and
therefore the very point in controversy.
The former constitution used aa the
pluraljvnlghts Templars. I am satis
fied on the whole that the expression
Knights Templar, is a violation of both
the grammatical laws of our language
and the usage of the best writers on
both sides of the Atlantic and should,
therefore, I think, be abandoned." The
State textbook that uses Knights Tem
plars Is correct according to the most
ancient writers and the modern dic
tionaries, as well as the older ones. The
commanderies in using on their letter
heads Knights Templar are right, be
cause that is the name of the order as
laid down in the constitution. Under

The beneficial effects of bacteria are
no less interesting than the part they
play in the propagation of disease, and
a recent discovery is that the vegeta
ble gums found on trees, such as gum
arabic, are the results of their activity.
Previous to some investigations by Dr.
S. Greig Smith of New South Wales, it
was believed that vegetable gums werÂ«Â»
the result of the unhealthy or patho
logical conditions of the trees on which
they were formed, but the entire sfib
ject was one about which comparative
ly little was known. Dr. Smith, believ
ing that bacteria produced the gum,
examined two trees from which it ex
uded, and obtained two varieties of
bacteria, of which he made cultures.
Under ordinary conditions of culture
the formation of gum was only sug
gested, but when tannin, a constituent
of bark, was added to the culture me
dium, a thick slime was produced in
considerable quantities. This slime was
made up of gum, as well as bacterial
cells and albumenoids, and by a simple
chemical process a clear, transparent
and brittle gum was obtained similar
to the arabin derived from gum arabic.
and resembling in its essential proper
ties the natural substance. Dr. Smith's
conclusion was that the arabin gums
derived from trees are bacterial and
not higher plant products, and that
certain constituents of the sap, under
the action of bacteria, are changed into
gum, which exudes from cracks or
wounds in the bark, or else is carried
by the sap to the fruitâ Harper's

DURING the present week the Portland Commer
cial Club will consult, in Portland, with repre
sentatives of Oregon cities and towns in promo
tion of its idea for the formation of a State development
league. The Portland Commercial Club is corrfposed of
leading citizens. Its aim is patriotic and sensible and
success ought to attend its efforts. If Oregon is assisted
to grow greater by any means our northern neighbor
will have the good will of California. The interests of
the Pacific Coast States of the Union are largely in com
mon. What adds to the prominence of any serves to
bring recognition to all.
Prior to the holding of the conference at Portland
the Portland Commercial Club has sent out letters ad
dressed to the Mayors of Oregon cities soliciting an ex
pression of opinion regarding probable results and also
concerning the feasibility of inducing Oregonians to
pull together for the common good. Some of the re
sponses are interesting and significant.
Mayor Dimick of Oregon City answers that Clackamas
County has undeveloped territory, mineral resources,
large timber belts and wonderful water power that can
be developed in the mountain streams, with a fine mar
ket at home for its products. To make these known
must result in enhancing their value. Mayor Hayter of
Dallas hits the nail squarely on the head in writing that
"Oregon needs advertising in the Eastern States and
now is the time to advertise." He sees no reason why
the interior and Portland should not work together har
moniously to promote ,the development of every part
of the State of Oregon. Much will be gained if nothing
more is accomplished than the general understanding
and good feeling that a conference induces where all
interests and all sections are represented. With the
advantages in view Mayor Dimick also perceives that
care in the selection of the officers of a State develop
ment body is of great importance. "Its promoters must
take care that the offices do not fall into the hands of
broken-down politicians or broken-down grafters, of
which every city and town in Oregon has its full share."
Mayor Waters of Salem finds that there can be no ar
gument against advertising the State of Oregon. Mayor
Talmage of Tillamook, Mayor Moore of More, Mayor
Scngstackcn of Marshfield and Mayor Ross of St.
Helens coincide in this view. The success that has
attended the efforts of California to secure the proper ad
vertising in the East through the agencies of the Califor
nia State Board of Trade and the California Promotion
Committee may have stimulated the Oregonians to make
a move for publicity. The preliminary expressions
would seem to indicate that there is no doubt that Ore
gon will soon have a State Development League and
that substantial benefits may be derived therefrom. ,

A Russian newspaper, evidently yellow in its tenden
cies or having designs upon some of the bigwigs of
the empire, has made the startling suggestion that a
Cabinet of responsible Ministers be created for the
Czar. It is safe to assume that if the appointment of
such officers involves any more serious responsibility
than that assumed by the late Von Plehwe the recom
mendation will be rejected with contemptuous emphasis.

â¢ When Police Judge Fritz is on the
bench he is dignity personified. When
off he is as fond of a practical joke
as any man. One of his jokes recent
ly caused no end of excitement for
some hours at the Hall of Justice.
Colonel Cronin of the property clerk's
office had bought a turkey for his
Sunday dinner. He took it to the of
fice and placed it at an open window
near the corridor. The Judge hap
pened to visit the office and when
leaving he espied Cronin's turkey. He
quietly seized it unobserved and car
ried it to his chambers. He tele
phoned to Captain Martin that some
one had stolen a turkey from the
property clerk's office and Detective
Dlnan was detailed on the case.
Meantime Attorney Shortall had
seen the turkey in the Judge's cham
bers and thinking it belonged to the
Judge he carried it to the bond and
warrant clerk's office and hid It. The
Judge had noticed 'him ami soon had
the gobbler back in his chambers. He
rang for a messenger boy and sent
him with the turkey to Otto Heyne
mann, stenographer in the Chiefs of
fice. A note accompanied the turkey,
purporting to come from Johnnie
Kreiss, saloon-keeper, and wishing
Heynemann the compliments of
the season. Heynemann called Kreiss
up by phone and said: "I am
awfully obliged, Johnnie; many
thanks." Kreiss replied, not knowing
exactly what he meant: "That's all
right."
The Judge then telephoned to Mar
tin that he thought Heynemann had
stolen Cronin's turkey. Dinan and
Cronin rushed into the Chief's office
and Cronin grabbed hold of the tur
key. "What are you doing?" yelled
Heynemann. "Let go my turkey."
Cronin and Heynemann hung to the
turkey, each vociferating it belonged
to him. Dinan asked Heynemann
where he got it and Heynemann re
plied, "From Johnnie Kreiss." Dinan
called Kreiss up by phone and Kreiss
answered that he knew nothing about
Heynemann's turkey. Heynemann
collapsed and Cronin marched proud
ly away with his recovered treasure.

plication for leave to attend the encampment, cannot fly
in the face of a matter of daily bread to carry out an
?obligation to the State*
There should be a more liberal spirit on the part of
employers who hesitate to allow th :ir employes the time
for attendance upon the annual encampment. The an
nual gathering of the State troops for field practice and
drill is not designed to be a prolonged lark for those
who participate, profiting nothing to State or individual,
but it is as important an element in the safeguarding of
the commonwealth as the operations^ of the legislative
machinery or the regulation of the finances. A thor
oughly equipped, thoroughly drilled body of State mili
tary is no less a part of the State government than the
civil arm of the law. The business man would be the
first to feel the effect of a weakened National Guard in
time of public danger.
From their past record Californians have reason to be
proud of the guardsmen and zealous for their future.
No State had a brighter record of volunteer service in
the Philippines than did ours through the First Califor
nia Regiment. These men were of the National Guard.
It was therein that they learned the practices of war
and it was to join that body again that most of them
returned as veterans. While we have a body of State
troops of so high a morale and so efficient a potentiality
we should unite to further its interests and support its
every need.
JB. LAUCK, adjutant general of the National
Guard of California, has made recent announce
â¢ ment of the difficulties that beset the assembling
of a full complement of the State militia for the com
ing encampment on account of the recalcitrant attitude
of the employers alleged by the guardsmen to be ;>iri
force in the matter of granting vacations. Lauck says
that he is daily in receipt of letters from members of
the National Guard the State over protesting the inabil
ity of the several writers to obtain from their employ
ers the requisite two weeks 1 .vacation.*. Either they are
refused a leave of absence, entirely or the respite is
given them without a continuance of salary.
If the restrictions complained of by the National
Guard members are indeed as general as the word "of
Adjutant General- Lauck would have it, the militiamen
themselves cannot be blamed if the quota of the com
panies at Atascadero falls below the mark. Many of
the members who are men of family, and possibly of no
great means, cannot afford to take two weeks from their
earning period at the small pay offered by the regula
tions of the State militia if their employers are unwilling
to give them the time' off with full remuneration.

The_ cause of the 1S93 riot was
â¢ trivial, in the extreme. The rector of
the St. Petersburg University an
"nounced that any one attempting a
demonstration on February S, the an
niversary of. the foundation, would be
expelled. .The students, until this an
nouncement, had no idea of demon
strating, but they resented the rector's
â¢words and promptly organized* some
excitement- The police took them
seriously and charged, throwing all
v.ho resisted over the parapets of a
bridge. on the frozen Neva. Five stu
dents were killed and fifty wounded
in tfcis way. And yet at other times,
when no attention is paid, the little
effervescence . passes away so quickly
that the students themselves, finding
nothing heroic, forget their pledges
to one another and return to the calm
of university life. Almost without ex
cvption, before every examination at
each university, there is a meeting of
protest at which the students pledge
themselves not to pass the examina
tions. To render leakage impossible
they deliver to one of their .number
the certificates, without which they
nre not admitted before the board, and
they denounce as cowards and traitors
those who object. But Uie next morn

â¢ General- Dragemiroff. a hero of the j
JIusso-Turkish war and noted as the
best strategist in Russia, has his own
theories about students" riots, which he
fonsiders mere child's play and no more
worthy of attention than the pranks of
Harvard students stealing barbers'
j.r>les and shop signs. So when the stu
dents rose up Dragomiroff did nothing.
He let them march in procession
" through the town until they were ex
hausted:" l.e Jet them seize a car and
ride arourd crying "Down with the
Government" until they were hoarse,
and. finally, disgusted by the utter in
tlifference of authorities and populace,
the students dispersed and went home.
M^anwh-jl*, however, a jealous subor
dinate had seen his chance to advise St.
Petersburg of an uprising which Drago
miroff was neglecting, and a telegram
soon demanded of the Governor why he
had taken no measures to protect the
city. Dragomiroff promptly called out
two .full regiments and all the artillery,
"charged at double speed through the
town, surrounded the university with
pointed cannon. Intrenched his soldiers
round about and telegraphed as follows
to the Czar:
"Have surrounded the enemy's quar

The absurdity was so evident that
the Czar laughed heartily and counter
manded the censure which was to have
been administered to Dragomiroff. But

bury rolitics are apt to count more in
a candidate's favor than competency.
The case is cited of a professor of
commercial law at Odesa who, being
too lazy to prepare lectures, contented
himself with reading without comment
passages from a book written by him
self on the subject, which book was
in the possession of all the students.
Another story is told of a general ap
pointed rector of a university who se
verely took to task the librarian be
cause there were gaps here and there
in the rows of books. "You must keep
the library ship-shape," he ordered.
"Hereafter see that the first student
who asks for a book shall take the
first from the first shelf and then the
second, and so on, that the rows may
be kept clean." And he threatened
to send away the librarian for foolishly
suggesting that numerical order might
not coincide with the subjects desired.
At some of the provincial universi
ties there are important chairs with
out occupants, because the Govern
ment's choice fell en some man with
out the necessary degree, who is too j
indifferent or too limited to attain
them and who, consequently, cannot
take possession. While preventing any i
competent person from obtaining: the

there is no professor of Roman law !
at the Odessa University. At Warsaw i
there Is no professor of commercial
law. And yet students must get these
subjects up and pass examinations on
them before receiving their degrees.
Except at St. Petersburg and Moscow
professors of political economy never
have any knowledge of modern events,
their course stopping short a quarter
of a century or so back.
To this ' cause of dissatisfaction
among students is added another,
which is connected with it and inten
sifies it. That is. a law forbidding any
one from entering a university save
that in the region of the preparatory
school which he attended. The country
is divided into ten great regions, each
with Its universityâ St. Petersburg,
Moscow, Odessa, Warsaw, Kharkoff,
Kasan, KiefT, Helsingfors, Dorpat and
Tomsk. And as at starting school a
child must decide on his university,
the result is almost invariably that
he is bound to his local university.
The Government has devised this pur
posely, to prevent a flooding of the
two capitals, St. Petersburg and Mos
cow, where the education to be ob
tained is far superior to that of the
other centers. This is considered rank
injustice, since the rich, who can af
ford their entire education from child
hood in the capitals, can form excep
tions for these privileges.
These are not the only causes for
discontent among Russian university
students. There is also the lack of
all rights In the university, each stu
dent being required on entering to
sign a paper acknowledging himself to
be merely a visitor or guest. Then
there is the exaggerated system of su
pervision bv an inspector, who is
generally a retired general and who
holds them responsible for every petty
action, as If they were children. Those
preparing for the university are
watched with such strictness that'they
desire some little liberty when once
they have matriculated, and they re
sent the abuse of authority. Further
more, there is the crucial grievance of
a prohibition of societies of any de
scription or even of general meetings.
The direct consequence of this last
measure is that a students' movement
of protest becomes revolutionary from
the start. Xot having any place in
which to assemble, they are constrain
ed to march into the university and
take forcible possession of a hall or
lecture-room. They lock the doors,
hold a meeting, in due form right in
the sacred precincts and pass resolu
tions. When the superior, warned, pre
sumes to interfere, the students, know
ing that their action has already put
them beyond the pale of conciliation,
catch him. beat him to avenge all past
resentment and end by kicking him
out. The next day the superintendent
publishes a notice in the papers say
ling that,' owing to a sudden Indisposi
tion, be. will be unable to attend to his
duties for a brief period, which lasts
until the ringleaders have been im
prisoned.
A boycott of the university follows
the meeting; manifestoes are posted in
the streets. Notices are sent to the
other universities and demonstrations
break out. Often the trouble is quelled
before this last stage is reached by the
arrest of the leaders. Government spies
are In each class, registered as stu
dents, who participate in the meeting

happens not unfrequently, in virtue

THE joint committee of the Senate and House on
the merchant marine arrives in this city to-day,
with Senator Gallingcr of New Hampshire as its
chairman. The revival of our merchant marine has been
under discussion for several years. The subject was
concreted during the first administration oÂ£ ' President
McKinley, and has since been before Congress in some
form, but no decision on methods has been reached.
Like too many of our eco- mic issues, it has impinged
upon party politics, and plays have been made for polit
ical advantage rather than for the welfare of the coun
try and the promotion of its commerce. It is an issue
of vital importance Jo this coast, because, without asking
permission of Russia, the position we have asserted in
the trade of the Pacific must be maintained for our own
development and in the interest of the national honor.
When Secretary of Agriculture Wilson made his first
visit here he was entertained by a large company ,of
Californians as the guest of Mr. William H. Mills, and
in a thoughtful address said that Dewey's ships in Manila
Bay had proclaimed American primacy of the Pacific. The
sentiment was heartily applauded. But it requires more
than a declaration and applause to create an actuality.
Primacy on deep water can be manifest only under the
flag of the primate. Until we so write our title the fact
remains only in the form of an ambitious aspiration.
How to effect the transformation of that aspiration into
fact is the problem before the country awaiting solution.
Let us not be understood as saying that this coast is
to be'the sole beneficiary of a revival of our merchant
marine. In proportion to the greater volume of its deep
sea trade the Atlantic seaboard's interest far transcends
our own. What is desirable is to join the two coasts in
a unified determination to secure legislation that will
put American commerce under the American flag, and
keep it there, while still offering Iiosptality to the mer
chant flags of other nations. At present we are driven
out of competition. We are not in the race. We spend
hundreds of millions every decade for ocean freights
that go to the ships of othe'r nations. Our flag is not
on merchant ships enough to do our transportation for
a single fortnight. It is a stranger not only in the sea
ports of the world but in our own. All Americans re
cognize this as an evil. For every national evil there
must be a remedy, no matter how snAll the evil may be.
When it is of such magnitude as this the necessity for a
remedy is of equal measure.
This visiting committee was authorized by Congress to
make close inquiry info conditions, to learn the extent
of the necessities of both seaboards, and, above all, to
get the commercial judgment as to what ought to be
done. We are entering upon the construction of an
American canal, open to the commerce of all nations.
We are preparing to expend vast sums upon that enter
prise. But when it is finished shall we see passing
through it, triumphantly, the flags of all nations ex
cept our own? At this moment both parties are united
in indorsing the construction of the canal, and why?
Because it i> a facility to our commerce. Why can
there not be the same unity upon a policy that will carry
that commerce under our own flag?
This Pacific Coast is a deeply interested section of the
country. Our flag once dominated the Pacific Ocean
before we owned a mile of its shore. The primitive
tribes and the simple Spanish settlers seldom saw any
other. The tribes were so impressed by the constant
procession of American ships, most of them cleared from
Boston, that the common name for a white man in all
their dialects from San Diego to Puget Sound was "Bos
ton man," and to this day in the jargon spoken by most
of those who survive, the term for heaven, the Elysian
fields of the future, is "Boston illahie," the upper Bos
ton. But the marine glories of that day have faded,
and exist only as a fossil in philology.
Now we own -the coast. We have islands in the Pa
cific. We have a vigorous and growing trade with
Asia. We are only just beginning to exploit the resources
which supply the articles of commerce for profitable
exchange- with the Orient. We have made a new con
quest of the Pacific with our navy. Shall we. have a
merchant marine to hold it. or shall we surrender
it? A more pressing question was never presented to a
people than this. Shall it be said we have resources
to build an American canal on the isthmus, but none
| to encourage the building of American ships to use it?
While the committee is here our commercial commu
| nity should frankly and forcibly present its case. It is
I our day in court and our petition should be full. The
committee may rely upon this, that whatever conclusion
it reaches as a result of these conferences, backed by
I its independent investigation, will be supported by Cali-
I fornia in Congress. We cannot afford to remain as we
are. In these days those who stand still until the pro-
I cession passes cannot hope to overtake it. We don't
i want to be put in that position. The committee will
! have every facility and every hospitality at its disposal,
| for our people are impressed with the importance' of the
issue and the advantage which the occasion offers.

"The preservers on the main deck
were in bad condition," said Todd.
"You could break off the corners as
you would a biscuit. Out of 1082 we
condemned 372. The mark Was so old
that we could not see it. The manu
facturer's date was 1877.
"One of the life boats had three
broken oars and another two. Two of
the boats were much rotted and an
other had a broken rudder. One of the
life rafts had no rowlocks, they hav
ing been broken off. On some of the
life rafts apparent rivets on inspection
were shown to be only false heads, the
parts being soldered."
"For ornament?" inquired Chairman
Murray.
"No, sir," emphatically answered the
inspector; "for fraud."
The witness testified that he heard
the order for the fire drill given by the
supervising inspector, and he also
heard the master say that he did not
know what orders to give for the drill.
He finally blew a general alarm on the
whistle and rang four or five times
on the ship's bell before the crew an
swered, testified the witness.
NEW YORK, Aug. 2. â An inspector
who yesterday made a partial examina
tion of the excursion steamship Grand
Republic to-day told the Federal Com
mission, which is investigating the
General Slocum disaster, that the life
saving and fire-fighting apparatus on
the Grand Republic is practically
worthless.
This steamship is a sister ship to the
General Slocum, which was burned in
East River several weeks ago, with a
loss of nearly a thousand lives. She
is owned by the Ttnickerbocker Steam
ship Company, which also owned the
Slocum.
The inspector who examined the
Grand Republic told the commission
that neither the captain nor crew knew
what to do when a fire bell was or
dered; that some of the fire hose burst
when subjected to water .pressure; that
a large percentage of the life pre
servers were worthless, some of them
having been manufactured as long ago
as 1877; that the life boats were pro
vided with broken oarsâ one was badly
rotted and another had a broken rud
der; that one of the life rafts had no
oar locks, and that on some of the
rafts what appeared to be rivets upon
closer inspection proved to be only
false heads, the parts being soldered.
This story was told by Inspector
James" M. Todd, who with Supervising
Inspector Rodie and Chairman Murray
of the Federal Commission boarded the
Grand Republic yesterday afternoon
as she was about to start on one of her
regular trips to Coney Island with pas
sengers.
HONOLULU, July 27.â An injunction
proceeding: of the utmost importance
has been instituted by Attorney Gen
eral- Andrews on behalf of the Terri
tory of Hawaii against the Pacific
Hardware and Steel Company and its
agent, T. A.. Hays, to restrain them
from doing business in this Territory.
It is a test case to see what power the
Territory has in the taxation of extra
territorial concerns doing business
through offices situated here. The At
torney General's bill of complaint re
cites that the respondent company ex
ists as a corporation organized under
the laws of California, has its principal
place of business in San Francisco, and
that for twelve months past it has been
doing business in Hawaii through its
agent, who maintains an office here.
The corporation does not invest its cap
ital here, nor is it engaged in the busi
ness of foreign or interstate commerce,
yet the complaint alleges it has failed
to perform the following acts required
by the Territorial law:
It has neglected to file a copy of its
charter; it has failed to file with the
Treasurer the names of its officers; it
has failed to file the name of a person
upon whom legal notices may be
served; it has neglected to file state
ments of its affairs, and it has failed to
obtain an annual license for the use of
its agent, T. A. Hays.
The fight thus begun is one which has
been fought out in many States of the
Union with varying success. The point
that the Attorney General is seeking to
establish is that the foreign concerns
come here to compete with local mer
chants and pay no taxes of any sort.
The last Legislature drew up a law to
cover this matter, and now it is being
applied. The statute Is based on a
Pennsylvania statute which has stood
the test of the federal courts. The line
of defense against it in all probability
will be that the statute is in contra
vention of the interstate commerce
laws, and the question will be fought
out along that line.

the Mississippian Who
â¢ Abused President's Mother
Is Unfit for Distinction
After examining the material evi
dence in the case of Estella Welley, a
Marine Hospital nurse, who caused the
death ot a patient by giving him poison
Michael Garcia was accused of sell
ing liquor without a license, and the
complaining policeman testified that
he had purchased a bottle of beer and
four drinks of whisky and partaken
of free lunch in the defendant's gro
cery before he made the arrest. Then
spake the earnest young attorney for
the defense:
"Did you see any other eating para
phernalia on the premises?"
Judge Conlan and every one in the
courtroom stared Inquiringly at the
lawyer, who deliberately repeated the
question:
"Iâ askâ youâ ifâ youâ sawâ any â oth
er â eating â paraphernalia â onâ the â
premises?".
The policeman said he didn't under
stand. Clerk Rice suggested "chiffo
niers" and Bailiff Laws ventured "side
boards." The Judge abruptly and cold
ly dismissed the case, and the triumph
ant attorney was driven from the cor
ridors by applications for further en
lightenment as to what he really did
mean.
S. Mehr, a curly-haired little Scan
dinavian, pleaded guilty of obtaining
$7 from S. Subfin under false pre
tense, and Judge Fritz sent him up
for ninety days. By representing him
self to be the possessor of great wealth
and in quest of a desirable investment,
Mr. Mehr succeeded in "borrowing"
from the credulous Mr. Subfin several
smaller sums than the one afore men
tioned. â¢ ,
Henry Hahn and a few jovial com
panions were crossing a vacant lot on
Howard street, between Sixth and Sev
enth, at a late hour on Monday night,
when they became entangled in some
loose wire that had been left there
by linemen. The more they struggled
to extricate themselves the more they
became entangled, and they were
swearing strange oaths with loud
voices when Patrolman Castro, who
was two blocks away, overheard them.
Thinking a riot was in progress, he
hastened to the spot and fell among
the cursing, writhing crew, one of
whom, Henry Hahn, violently assault
ed him. With the aid of lighted
matches and a wire cutter the officer
succeeded in arresting and carrying
away Mr. Hahn, leaving the others
to unwrap themselves as best they
could. In response to Hahn's plea
that he did not know that the person
who fell atop of him in the darkness
was a policeman, Judge Cabaniss im
posed a fine of only 55.
"Even If your statement is true you
are a contemptible fellow to utter it,"
was the Judge's comment.
Mrs. Samuel Keyes told Police Judgft
Conlan that she considered her life
menaced bv her husband, an English
man, who. she said, followed her from
Philadelphia to this city with the evi
dent purpose of doing her bodilv in
jury. For five days and nights he had
shadowed her home at 2676 McAllister
street, compelling her and her two
children to remain within doors until
they were forced by hunger to tele
phone for police protection.
"Bless 'er "art," said Mr. Keyes,
smiling blandly upon the shrinking
woman, "I- wouldn't 'urt an 'air of
'er head. She knows I love 'er so
'ard that I cawn't live without 'er.
'Er children 'ave turned 'er 'art against
me, and hif I could get her awai from
'em we could dwell in 'appiness to
gether. Cawn't I 'ave a word with 'er
in proivate?"
The woman shuddered at the pro
posal, and the Judge was quick to per
ceive her fear.
. "You see the abiect terror with
which she regards you?" he said.
"Yes; and I cawn't understand it.
I was a good 'usband to 'er, and she
was 'appy until her children turned
'er 'art."
"Well, I understand it," said his
Honor, "and to-morrow I shall com
mit you, fixing a bond so high that
this lady shall not be terrorized by
your liberty."
Then the defendant's tone changed.
He declared that for six years prior
to their marriage two and a half years
ago the woman and he had lived to
gether as husband and wife.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed the charge
of muyder against Giovanni Fossa be
cause two of the principal witnesses for
the prosecution had left the State.
The case had been in the courts since
June 2, 1903, when Fossa was arrested
for throwing Vencenzo Lavagnino down
stairs in a house in the Italian quarter.
Lavagnino died from his injuries, and
Judge Conlan held Fossa for man
slaughter. District Attorney Byington,
however, filed a new complaint, charg
ing murder, and Superior Judge Lawlor
dismissed it in accordance with a re
cent Supreme Court decision to the ef
fect, that a defendant could not be
placed twice in jeopardy for a single
crime. Byington. then filed another
com plaint, and the | preliminary hearing
of it yesterday by Judge Cabaniss re
eulted in Fosra again being discharged.
James F. Young, accused of swind
ling Mrs. Sarah E. Johnson out of $2000
by means of a get-rich-quick scheme,
had a hearing before Judge Fritz, the
charge being grand larceny. The case
was continued till August 11, the de
fendant's bail being reduced from $5000
to $2000. The original charge of felony
embezzlement against Young will prob
ably be taken up this morning by
Judge Cabanlss.
Attorney Mack asserted, and prom
ised to prove, that there was collusion
between Nellie Bennett and the man
who sold two diamond rings which she
alleged were mysteriously stolen from
her and which she sought to recover
from the pawnbroker who bought them
for $200. Ex-Judge D. J. Murphy de
clared with equal positiveness his abil
ity to prove that the woman had no
connection whatever with the seller of
the jewelry. Then the case was con
tinued for two weeks by Judge Fritz,
who said that if collusion was not then
established he would order the restora
tion of the rings to the woman.
In the course of her testimony Mrs.
Bennett confessed that she has been
twice married and as many times di
vorced. One of her ex-husbands Is an
official of Tonopah County, Nevada,
and he is the person whom Attorney
Mack evidently suspects of having been
in collusion with her when the rings
were sold. Effort to have himâ or even
his photograph â produced in court has
been unavailing.
When informed that the fine was $5
she promptly paid it, and then inquired
how much she owed the Judge for hia
trouble. "Not a cent," Clerk Duffle re
plied. "Well, ain't that funny?" tit
tered Annie Wilson.
"The tine," she chuckled
Annie Wilson, pert and smiling and
gorgeously appareled, beamed upon
Judge Fritz when he stated that the
charge of drunkenness against her had
been pretty clearly proved. She fairly
radiated human kindness.
"How much is it?" she chirruped,
opening a red morocco hand satchel
embellished with "A. W." """in brassy
flowing script.
"How much is what?" his Honor
asked.

John Bacigalupi while engaged in al
tercation with a newsboy on Broadway
incidentally hurled .a heavy rock at his
opponent. The missile missed Its in
tended mark, caromed off a curb and
struck Patrolman Proll upon the head,
creating a bump that seriously inter
fered with the proper wearing of his
official helmet. The bump was exhib
ited to Judge Conlan, who carefully
noted its size and formation and then
continued the case to allow Mr. Baci
galupi to bring in testimony for his de
fense.
When the case was called in Judge
Conlan's court the officers testified that
their trouble did not fairly begin until
the patrol wagon arrived at the saloon
in response to their summons. Then one
of the female prisoners, whose indU
vidual avoirdupois was estimated at 210
pounds, resolutely declined to enter the
vehicle and resisted effort to thrust her
into it. The united effort3 of four stal
wart men were puny as compared to
the physical strength displayed, by the
woman, and the question of sending for
a derrick was under serious discussion
when Mr. Woodson and the other wom
en stepped in and by suasion and force
obviated further difficulty.
The case was continued for a week,
and Mr. Woodson was informed that
his violation of the midnight ordinance
would be reported to the Police Com
mission.
Patrolmen Cannon and Mills were
passing the saloon of P. M. Woodson,
on Leavenworth street, at 2:30 o'clock
yesterday morning when their ears
were assailed by the refrain of "A Bit
of Blarney" warbled by a badly bal
anced feminine quartet. They invaded
the wet goods shop and in a rear room
discovered Jane Gallagher, Florence
Griffith, Nancy Watts and Isabella Post
violating the rudiments of vocal har
mony, while Mr. Woodson approvingly
listened. When asked if he knew that
he was fracturing an ordinance by al
lowing music â or discord â to be created
in his establishment after midnight, he
replied that he was simply doing what
many other saloonists farther down
town were doing, and hinted that in
their interference with him the police
men were showing discrimination. They
retorted that they permitted no law
breaking on their beat and that if Mr.
Woodson persisted in making himself
an exception to the rule they would be
compelled to arrest him. Then the la
dies ceased trying to sing and began
telling each other what they thought of
the police force as a whole and its two
representatives there present in' par
ticular, said comments being of such
uncomplimentary character that the ar
rest of their authors was also decided
upon.
Joe de Falco's neglect to transfer his
peddler's license tag from his old vest
when he donned a new one led to his
arrest. Judge Cabanlss dismissed the
case after he had kindly advised the
absent-minded peddler either to change
vests again or to transfer the tag be
fore resuming business.
instead of the medicine prescribed for
him, Judge Fritz remarked that it ap
peared to be a more serious case than
the newspapers had presented. The
bottle from which the fatal draught
was taken was plainly marked "poison"
and . differed somewhat in shape from
the bottle containing the medicine.
Manslaughter is the charge against the
woman, and the Judge intimated that
he might deem it advisable to send the
case to a jury.

It Js frequently the case that a party wishes
! to eell his holdings fcr the purpose of reinvest.
t Ing the proceeds In a different kind of property.
j Our lonz experience In this business enables
! us to often accomplish this double purpose by
i only cne transaction. The only condition wÂ«
: make Is that your property. If you wish us to
dispose of It for you, MUST BE GOOD OF ITS
KIND AND IN A GOOD LOCATION. Doa t
I take up either our time or your own with
I worthless offerings, or property so heavily
mortgaged as to leave no actual equity.
If It has merit, whether you own real estate
or a mercantile or manufacturing business.
I bring a description of same to our office, Â«tat-
ing what klftd of property you prefer In ex-
change, and y O a will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and ars

specialty of same. We make no charge for ad-
vertising or any other purpose unless we pro-
cure an exchange satisfactory to you to ac-

"Blanche Blackwell," was arrested a
month ago on a charge of stealing a
purse from a woman on Mason street,
but after being released on bail she de
camped. She was rearrested last night

that will be made against her this

NEW YORK. Aug. 2.â Dull and apathetic
tradins marked the Stock Exchange session
to-day and the movement of prices was so
Â«luÂ«lsh as to be of little Importance. The
gutter of prices was Intermittently upward
and downward and was part of the time above
*nd part of the time below last night's closing
level. The resumption of business in the Lon
don stock market after a three days' holiday
bad little effect in reviving the influence of
the international political friction in Europe.
In fact, buying for London account was a fac
tor in the first hour here and helied to absorb
the light profit taking. Foreign markets them
selves seemed little aiTected by political j or
military events. In spite of the importance of
the harpenings In the Far Eart. A sharp re
action in Metropolitan Street Railway follow
ing yesterday's strength was the early feature
here and was easily traceable to th6 de
nial fcy President B-Mmoni of the ru
mor that Interborough capital was seeking the
control of tee Metropolitan system. Southern
Pacific seemed to enjoy a belated advantage
from to-day's report of large steel rail pur
chases for taÂ« Harrlraan system, while Union
Pacific was subjected to profit taking. Penn
sylvania made no response to the June earn
ings statement, which showed the continued
fail in gross earnings at last overcome by the
drastic retrenchments put . in force Â¦ by . the
company. The extent of these retrenchments
offer a further formidable prospect to other
railroads, which eee in that . process the . only
method cf conservinx net" earnings, but which
may be r.ot so well equipped for reducing op
erating expenses. The day's discussion of crop
proepects was against the stock* marker. â¢ The
deterioration in spring wheat reported by. the
Weather Bureau was more emphasized in the
estimates of some private authorities who have
following! in the speculative market.
The cotton market also reflected some anx
iety over the condition of that crop. The sus-
T-ense of the decision as to a strike of the an
thracite miners -was a repressive Influence on
thÂ«. coalers, but the prevailing sentiment was
hopeful of avoiding a strike. >The unrest of
lsbor va> held before the public attention by
the tel'Krsphers' troubles on the Kansas and
Texas Railway. The market shewed decreas
ing resistance to the weight upon it ' and
clewed eaFy at about the lowest of the day.

although there was an abundance of low
grade fruit on hand, good stock was easily dis
posed of. some fancy lots in regular boxes
selling as high as â¬Cc per box. Large open
boxes did better, as the market had previously
been pretty well cleaned up. The top quotation
was obtained only for one line of exceptionally
fine fruit from Sonoma County, SI being about
the top for the general market. The cancers
were purchasing freely cf Green Gage Plums
and Bartlett Pears, but were not handling other
fruits. Apricots in bulk were easier, owing to
the lack of demand for canning purposes, and

WHEATâ Foreign markets were firm, with
higher flguresi
Chicago nas excited and 2%c higher, chiefly
owing to the issuance of an estimate by Jones
of the Commercial West, who reduced his fig
ures on the crop to 530,000,000 bushels. This
is a marked falling off from preceding esti
mates. The volume of business was large.
Another source cf strength was the continu
ance of bad reports of the grain crop from the
Northwest, much of the Wheat in North Da
koti being reported dead frcm rust.
The Chicago wires of R. Brent Mitchell said:
"Liverpool closely followed the advance here
since last Friday and continental markets were
sharply higher and somewhat excited. The
broadening speculation U coming on the in
creasing crop damage complaints from the
Northwest. Theae are being confirmed from
all sources. The large receipts at primary
markets are to-day meeting with a Rood de
mand and prices are higher. There has been
free liquidation by the liberal short Interest
and a good deal of profit-taking by profession
al holders. The market, however, holds tha
advance well and reactions are very slight.
We regard the conditions, nowever, as bullish
and aavlse buying Wheat on fair recessions.' 1
This market was very firm, and sellers asked
higher prices for both California and Northern
Club, but buyers were unwilling to pay the
advance. Trading In futures was excited and
heavy, about 15,000 tons selling on the morning
session. The advance was due to the. Chicago
rl9e and covering by shorts, and amounted to
3Â»4c.

Brent Mitchell yesterday said: "It was active
and strong from opening to the close. Cables
were up sharply and European advices gener
ally were bullish. . There were indications of
a large cash business here. Broomhall cables
that the shortage in the Danubian corn crop and
the general shortage in the fodder crop of
Europe is making a strong situation. These
were the incentives in to-day's advance. The
weather Is fairly favorable. The recent devel
opment of an export demand has -materially
changed the conditions and outlook. It acts
like a bull market and we would buy on its
reactions."

The Butter market is working into better
condition, and the finest creameries are qucte<5 '
â¢till higher, with lighter stocks. Most dealers '
now report their supplies of choice goods light. I
though there Is no scarcity ia the general mar- S
ket, as the medium and lower grades are still
abundant and not firm. Receipts continue to '
run over 1O0O cases a day. as will be seen, and ;
the reduction in stock* Is attributed to the In- i
creased consumption due to thÂ« return of peo- \
pie from their summer vacations In the coun

Cheese continues in free supply and on- }

Eggs are still easy, with 25c the ruling fig

extra fine. Receipts are free and stocks are

CHICAGO, Aug. 2.â Wheat for September
delivery sold on the Board of Trade to-day for
9414c an advance of 2%&2%c, compared with
Saturday's closing- figures. The sharp upturn
was duo to alarming reports of rust damage to
spring wheat in the Northwest and to almost
equally i>eEslmisUc advices from foreign coun
tries. The market closed at the high point of
the day. Other trains were influenced by the
strength of wheat. Septemtx-r corn closing with
a gain of 2%Â®2Vic. Oats are up 1%^1%C.
Provisions are unchanred.
From start to finish the wheat market was
an exceptionally strong affair. An eslmate
made by a Minneajwlis crop report that the
total winter and opting wheat crop of the
United States would not be to exceed 350,000,-
COO bushels caused active covering by shorts
at the opening. As a result Initial quotations
on September were up H'S'Vsc to H^fÂ«c at
Â»2iie4Â«2%o.
Another factor of almost equal Importance
that contributed to the early bullishness was
the strength of all foreign grain market*. Liv
erpool being up from l?&d. compared with Fri
day's close. The price of wheat at Budapest
was reported to be from 7c to tsc higher than
Saturday's final nzures, ar*4 this added zest
to the buying. Many traders discredited these
figures, but when confirmation was forthcom
ing skeptical ones quickly Joined the bull ele
ment. Crop advices from the Northwest con
tinued to dilate on enormous damage by rust in
the spring wheat fields. Damage reports were
partly substantiated by the weekly Weather
Bureau bulletin. About P*.e only news ol a
bearish character was a decrease of 314.000
liu.-th.--lj- in the world's visible supply, as against
a decrease of l,Â«5n.W>0 bushels last year. The
rruirkt . receivrd the support of an active gen
eral demand throughout the entire day, buying
by Ncrthwest houa*s beinc especially heavy.
Foreigners also bought more freely in this mar
ket to-day than for several we-.ks pact.
With the exception of a slight recession soÂ«n
after the oieiiicg, when September touched
M%e, prices moved steadily upward, the close
being practically at the top. Final quotations
on September were at Â»4 1 Â»Â©'>1Uc, after the
price had reached 94 Uc Clearances of wheat
mi! flour were t^ua! to De.Sco bushels. Pri
mary Tf i â¢::Â¦!Â» -Â»era 723.CW bushels, against
S37,iuO bu*hels a year ago. Minneapolis, Du
luth and Chicago reported receipts at 46^ curs,
compared with 400 can last week and Â£32 cars
a year ago.
In th- corn market a burst of bull enthu
siasm at the opening was followed by a rather
easy tone, there being Influential selling by a
broker supposed to be acting for a leading
ele\ator concern. The market closed near the
highest point of the day. September opened
>,c to %c higher Â«t 51US 51%c. sold between
51c and WUc and closed at B3H93314& Local
receipts were 269 cars, wltli lti of contract
grade.
More than usual interest was taken in the
oats market. The market closed strong and at
th" top. September opened a shade lower to
a shade higher at 33ftfi33%c. sold up to 34Tic,
where it closed. Local receipts were 2S0 cars.
Notwithstanding the strength of grains the
provision market remained quiet and easy. A
decline of 10c In the orlce or hoes was the
principal bear influence. September pork
closed 21 %c lower. Lard was off 2%@5c. Ribs
were unchanged.

is quiet this week, most manufacturers having
freely stocked up during the early part of

on the state of the goods market, which has
not been as active as the manufacturers would
like. Fleeces and territory wools are firm and

terterrltorial steamship communication, and
second, reciprocal commerce. These two poli
cies would constitute a combined force which
would give to the Pacific Ocean & vast mer
chant marine.
The Importance of this merchant marine is
obvious. When the war between Spain and
the United States waa declared and the Phil
ippine Islands were conquested. w- did not
have sufficient steamships on the Pacific
Ocean to serve the purpose of Government
transports. Great nations are to arise on thÂ»
eastern shores of Asia;. Russian-Siberia, Ja
pan and China are from this time forth to be
come factors in Pacific Ocean commerce,
which will eventuate in a commerce far .ex
ceeding in volume that existing on the At
lantic.
The Swedish Republican Club met
last night at 161 City Hall avenue for
the purpose of ascertaining 1 how many
members had registered for the com
ing elections. Also many members
who have not yet been naturalized
were persuaded to take out papers.
Monthly meetings will be held by the
club until after election. The annual
picnic will occur on October 16 at

In the midst of the excitement^ the
horses attached to the carriage In
which the union men had been riding
became frightened and suddenly dashed
up New Montgomery street to" Market
and down that thoroughfare. At - the
Junction of Market and Second streets
the vehicle struck a fire hydrant and
was promptly demolished, but not until
It had broken the hydrant off at. its
base, from which shot a torrent of*
water hleh into the air, much after
the fashion of a Yellowstone "gusher "
Freed from the. hack, the frightened
horses, with traces dangling -at their
feet, proceeded in their flight down
Market street, but were finally cap
tured and safely tied to a telegraph
pole. Meanwhile the volume of water

terday terminated in a series of ex
pensive incidents that kept a big crowd
deeply interested for half , an hour.
Shortly after 2 p. m. a number of
union hackmen. including Peter Burns
and Percy Benson, drove up to the
New Montgomery-street entrance of
the Palace Hotel in a carriage and
proceeded to chide the drivers of the
hacks standing there for opposing the
union in its strike. Finally "Dud"
Kelly, one of the members of an up
town hack firm, became involved In
an altercation with the union men, and
a big crowd gathered in anticipation of j
a fight. Just as trouble seemed Imml
nent, however. Patrolman D. J. Dris- j
coll appeared on the scene - and pro- I
ceeded to quell the disturbance. !
While this work was going on, how
ever, the water rushing down Second
street had thoroughly flooded that
thoroughfare and finally found its way
into the basements of several business
houses on the west side of the street,
where it did about $1000 worth of dam
age. By the time the gusher had been
checked Police Officer Driscoll had
gathered in Hackmen Burns and Ben
son, who were conveyed in a blue
wagon to the southern station and
booked on charges of disturbing the
peace.

for half an hour before a detachment
of firemen arrived on the scene. Boldly
submerging themselves in the deluge,
they finally managed to reach a stop
cock in the street and stop the waste
of water. The broken hydrant was
tdien replaced by anew one.

As supplementing the foregoing outlined pol
icy, the Government of the United States
should address itself to the question of recip
rocal relation with the Orient, analogous to
that recently established with Cuba. It is the
consensus of opinion among far-seeing states
men that the Oriental countries are to have an
awakeninc. We have strenuously demanded
an own door - policy with reference to China.
The best way to secure and maintain an open
door policy with that vast reservoir of human
life, ultimately, to become. an object of most
profitable commercial relation, will b* to en
courage a trade relation by reciprocal duties.
Reciprocity between China. Japan and America
would be the beginning of a commercial rela
tion which would inevitably expand, i
In this view we have two perfectly tenable
propositions; first.* the encouragement of in-
We have in the Pacific Ocean many group*
of Islands; the principal of these are the
Philippines, with a population of 8.000,000
subjects of the United States; second, in mag
nitude are the Hawaiian Islands; but there are
other groups, euch as the Caroline Islands,
Ladrone Islands, etc., also the Territory of
Alaska. Commerce demands and deserves- the
fosterinc care of the nation. A bill to-subsi
dize steamship lines -under the American flair
plying between American- ports should be .pop
ular because- It will cheapen ocean transporta
tion and promote the export of American
products to American territory. This would
Cive to the people of America a measurable
monopoly of the. trade with the colonial de
pendents of this country, and in this way ail
portions of the country Â¦ would share equally
lu the benefit of Government munificence.
Though a general subsidy is not or may not
be possible, a restricted subsidy is not amen
able to the charge of Impracticability. It is
competent for the Government to subsidize in
terterrltorial communication under the pro
vision of the constitution which gives Con
gress control of interstate commerce. A sub
sidy to steamships carrying on Interstate
commerce between Interterritorial ports would
be - in line with the policy of internal im
provements. Railroads have been subsidized
to promote interstate commerce; likewise
steamships may be subsidized to promote in
territorial commerce. ... . '.
The commission appointed by the
â¢ Congress of the United States to In
quire into conditions of the merchant
marine service ' and ascertain what
measures are necessary for its expan
sion will arrive in Sain Francisco .to
day. Senator Galllnger of New Hamp
shire is at its head and several prom
inent national legislators are amonjc
the party. The aim of the commission
is to ascertain the needs and demands
of ocean shippers on the Pacific Coast
to the end that proper legislation may
be passed by Congress for the upbuild
ing of sea-faring commerce under the
flag of the United States. *
During, the . last and present week
conferences have been in progress be
tween the business. men of this city and
the traffic managers of the transconti
nental railway lines and the Pacific
Ada.il Steamship Company. These meet
ings were held for the purpose of ad
justing freight rates tor shippers. The
governmental control ; of the Panama
.Railroad has given the shippers of the
State an opportunity to unshackle the
bonds which have made them slaves
to the transcontinental railroads in the
matter of exporting their produce.
Fortuitously the visit of the Con
gressional Commission on Merchant
Marine is contemporary with the an
nouncement of the opening of the Pan- i
ama Railroad to all shippers. Its-mem- j
bers will spend two days in this city,
gathering information that will tend
to frame national laws for the benefit
of marine commerce. The commission
has announced that it wants fact, not
history. To that. end it has asked that
not only steamship men and traffic
managers generally be invited to talk,
but that men representative of those i
who stand before the mast and tell
their troubles in the forecastle be in
vited to the meeting. Among these will
be Andrew Furuseth, the eloquent sec
retary of the Coast Seamen's Union.
William H. Mills gave out a state
ment last night emphasizing the im
portance of the independent marine
service on this coast. His statement
follows: ._..: .r
A general subsidy measure to i all ocean
transportation is unpopular. No law can be
enacted that would meet the views of the en
tire nation. The Interior of a country does
not believe sufficiently in the direct benefit of
such a measure to favor- it. The question
which Is being considered by the Congressional
committee and on which a report is to .be
rnado on the first day of the coming session
of Congress is, how can the Government pro
mote the growth of shipping under the Amer
ican flax?

an Interesting Statement
In the Democratic political field the
rival chieftain?, Gavin McNab and
James H. O'Brien, are lining up their
respective forces for the general en
gagement at the primaries next Tues
day. In every Assembly district of San
Francisco each leader has filed a ticket,
but the assertion is made in both
camps that the tickets- were prepared
by the party leaders in the several dis
tricts without any pressure from head
qyarters. \
Gavin . McXab is apparently serene
and tranquil, being confident that the
forces of the regular organization will
win a complete victory. His scouts
have not discovered the presence of
formidable opposition in any district of
the town. The chief is in close touch
with the district leaders.
James H. O'Brien has established
campaign headquarters on the parlor

Governor Pardee xvill be home in a
day or two, end one of the first sub
jects to engage his attention will be the

of the State Board or Library Trustees,
one to succeed Or. Thomas Flint, de

It is expected that the Governor will
also appoint a major general of the

that Brigadier General Muller will be
promoted and then be retired at once
with the rank of major general. The
