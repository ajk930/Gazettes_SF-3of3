A well-attended gathering of mem
bers cf the citizens' reception gommit
te took plate in the Maple Room of the
Palace Hotel yesterday afternoon. The
general result accomplished at the
meeting was the organization of a
committee of ten to form sub-commit

the previous meeting the motion to or

Professor McAdie of the "Weather
Bureau was then asked -to prophesy
the kind of weather San - Francisco
would have during the conclave. Pro
fessor McAdie said that according to
preceding years the weather would be
ideal, but that this was an abnormal
year and it was hard to say what we
would get. The "Weather Bureau will
do its best to supply the right kind,
however. An interesting feature in
connection with the Weather Bureau
work during conclave week will "be the
receiving of weather reports from Lon
don, Paris, Lisbon and many other for
eign ports, including Hawaii and the
Philippine Islands. This will be the
first time in "Weather Bureau history
that so extensive a portion of. the

The competition drill fov the trophies
will bo held on tho baseball ground at
Golden Gate Park. The place is an ideal
parade field, a natural amphitheater
and -perfectly adapted to the exercises.
There will, of course, be no admission

Wednesday, September 7, beginning at
10 o'clock in the morning. Tents will
be placed on the ground for the accom
modation of the drill corps, judges and

A noble and distinct characteristic of
California is the grove of redwood trees
that will stand on the main floor of the
Mechanics' Pavilion. It is a real forest
scene, the green boughs reaching out
on all sides and the tree tons extend
ing to the lofty ceiling. The gallery

In the attack on the Siaolindzy po
sition one Japanese battalion lost all
of its officers.
The retirement of the Russian
transport of four corps yesterday
evening across the plain" while the ar
tillery and troops In the rear held off
the Japanese afforded a magnificent
spectacle. All along the extended line
there was an incessant roar of batr
teries, the Russians working their
gun3 with great coolness and not re
tiring until the transport was in
safety.
WAOYANG. Aus 23â The . Rua- - -
sians lost 300 Wiled or wounded dur
ing the retreat from Anshanshan. The
Japanese made a forced march tjy
night, overtaking the Russians at
daylight. General Routokovsky was
killed by the explosion of a shell.
The Japanese artillery resumed the
battle at 6 o'clock this morninff. the
point of pressure again being the
Russian south front. The Japanese
Infantry is now advancing: to attack,
the regiments deployed in open ro
der.
The Russian army successfully ef
fected its retirement on Liaoyang with
transport and artillery, and is now in
position awaiting the advancing Jap
anese. The progress of the latter has
been raoid and determined, sparing
no sacrifice.
TORIO, Au*r. SO.â The Russians are
concentrating at Uaoyans, either
with the intention of sivins a general
battle or retiring. They were beaten
nt Lunstsushan^and retreated froni
Anslmnslmn and Anping. Anslian
shan was the strongest defense Uao
yans possessed, and its loss renders
defense almost impossible. It i3 be
lieved here that General Kuropatkin
cannot now avoid a light and a crush
ing defeat.

LARAMIE. Wyo.. Aug. 29.â Joseph
llwtia. colored, was lynched by a mob
of SCTfc men in front of Judge Carpen
ter's house at S o'clock to-night.
Martin was a trusty in the County
*ail tnd attacked a white girl, Delia
Krause, in the jail kitchen and slashed
Jier face and arms with a knife. One
mad was wounded by Martin while the
mob was entering the jail to drag out
?he prisoner.
"After attacking Miss Krause with a
razor Martin was placed in a, cell in
the .County Jail. To-night a- mob
formed outside the jail. The first in
timation that Sherift Cook had of the
contemplated lynching was when two
masked men appeared in the kitchen
ofoth? jail house and. with revolvers
leveled at " him, told him that Ihere
were 300 men waiting outside for the
negro and that he had better not at
tempt to mak^ any trouble for them.
In the meantime another masked
man had entered and while the first
two held thv Sheriff the third man
look ttse keys of the jail from the
Sheriff's pocket ar.d then the three
Ettrted for tÂ«e negro's cell. On the
wjty thev met Turnkey Jones and Dr.
Mfiler. who had been summoned to
die^s the wounds on Martin, self-in
flicted with the same razor he had
use-d in the attack on the girl. Both
v.eie compelled to stand against the
eafe at the cells, with their faces
tun?Â§'j away from the mob.
The negro was then taken from his
cell and hurriedly marched through the
court-house into the street. , Arriving
at Â» lamppost a short distance from
the the negro was quickly strung
up to the post. During the entire pro*
eeedirijr he did not speak or attempt to
: c esist the mob. The lynching occurred
at about S o'clock and within an hour
skc streets were deserted.
Acting Coroner Grant took charge
of the bod: r of the negro and turned
it ov^r to an undertaker.
, Miss Krause undoubtedly would have
been killed by Martin had not the wife
of o Fhwiff Cook held him until, his rage
hÂ«d c^olnd and he could be taken from
th<?" kitchen. On the way out he slash
er* Frark Frazer, a bygtander, with a
butcher knife which he had seized from
the kitchen table. The wound is not
serious.

from Anping this afternoon debouched
upon the Liaoyang plain, after fight
ing a rear guard action for nearly ten
miles from Anping, bringing its
wounded and burying its dead on the
way. Six. guns are reported to have
been lost, but a number of Japanese
were captured, showing signs of great
fatigue and hardships.
The enormous army, the most of

disposed in an orderly manner through
the vast fields of Chinese corn, the sol

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 29.â An of

Sunday, confirms the report that Gen
eral Routokovsky was killed during the
rear guard engagements, and adds that
Colonel von ftaaben also was killed.

'"The whole six -corps, of which two
are European troops, have now formed
a semicircle within a radius of six or
eight miles of Liaoyang."
General Kuropatkin has not far short
of 170,000 men.
"The First Corps, which figured at
the battle of the Yalu and in the fight
ing at Motien Pass, again sustained the

combined under the command of^Gen
eral Zaroubaieff. and the Tenth, Seven
teenth and Third corps under General

gent, succeeded in effecting a concen
tration at Liaoyang without further
loss.
"The Japanese began at dawn on
August 27 two movements designed to
cut off the First and Fourth corps. The
First, stationed at Anshanshan. half
way between Haicheng and Liaoyang.
experienced the most serious difficulty
owing to bad roads. The cavalry under
General Oku tried to flank this corps
from the east. In the meanwhile Gen
eral Kuroki. abandoning his pressure of
General Ivanoff and General Herschel
mann. drove a wedge between the Sec
ond and Fourth corps, which were sta
tioned west of Liandiansian. a strong
defensive position in the hills twenty
four, miles southeast of Liaoyang. The
Russians, greatly impeded by their ar
tillery and commissariat, fought a se
ries of rear guard actions in order to
ccver the retreat of their impedimenta
to Liaoyang, in which they were suc
cessful.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 29.â The
operations around Liaoyang have un
dergone a complete change. Owing to
the delay in the construction of General
Kuropatkin's army, as a result of the
terrible condition of the roads, the
Japanese seized the opportunity to at
tack the slow-moving corps and severe
fighting occurred August 27 and 2S, in
which the Russians lost another. 1000
men, and they now probably will have
to accept a general engagement. Gen
eral Kuropatkin himself describes the
latest phase of the hostilities in a long
dispatch to the Emperor from a point
on the railroad a few miles south of
Liaoyang, where practically the whole
army was assembled and awaiting bat
tle. The telegram, which was filed early
this morning, says:
Japanese Strategy Cheeks the Retreat
of the "KuÂ»Ian Fox.*!
Â«
KIROPATRIN MUST FIGHT.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 30.â Even
late last night tfre greatest uncertainty
prevailed- regarding the^actual situa
tion at Liaoyang. There is an intense
anxiety for definite news from the
front, bux even the authorities ' are
practically ignorant as to whether the
long expected battle will be fought at
Liaoyang. or farther north.
It is expected that a great battle
is now- proceeding and there are many
indications that such Is the case. If
this is so the fate of this year's cam
paign mav be settled forty
eight hours. At the saAe time opinion
is almost equally divided, many be
lieving that General Kuropatkin will
not make a determined stand and that
the Japanese will crack the shell only
to find that the bird has flown.
One of the Russian correspondents
of the press says the fighting so far
has been eonrined wholly to rear guard
actions. The Russian force is now con
centrated in a series of exceedingly
strong positions around Liaoyang, but
the whole withdrawal was in acc<yd
ance with a prearranged plan. It is
certain that the armies are now in
close touch. The Japanese are advanc
ing in great force along both of the
roads converging on Liaoyang. but the
crucial question, whether it is the main
Russian army that is concentrated
there to receive them, or merely a
strong screen, has not been answered
up to this time.
Much depends upon the weather. It
is possible that the recent rains may
have made General Kuropatkin's with
drawal impossible, even if he desired
to withdraw, or that a further down
pour may disarrange the plans of both
sides; but the latest indications, that
the weather and the roads are improv
ing, should force a rise of the curtain
within t\rentv-four hours.

larger Taitse River.
The importance of the dispatch is In
the fact that, While it gives the situa

to Monday evening, it also shows be
yond any doubt that the Russian line
of communication is not cut.
BERLIN," Aug. '29. â The complaint
of the deputation from the London
Chamber of Commerce to Premier
Balfour Friday that Russia paid for
the German, vessels seized, while re
ffslng satisfaction, to the British, is
denied by Herr Diedrichsen 'of Kiel,
thp owner of the German steamship
Thea. which was sunk by the Vladi
vostok squadron in July, who tele
graphs that such is not the case. No
satisfaction has been given for the
Thea.
Government has given assurances to
Great Britain' that there is absolutely
no truth in the charges that Russian
warships are â¢ discriminating against
British shipping in; favor of German
or other shipping in connection with
their -operations to search for contra
band. It is explicitly stated that Rus
sia is not pursuing British ships, Ger
man ships or ships' of/any other na
tionality, but that -she' is solely pur
suing contraband. This assurance has
gone far to allay the irritation of the
Government here, which had been re
ceiving unofficial information intimat
ing discrimination.
The Japanese delay is believed to
have been due to the necessity of
bringing up siege guns with which to
break the Russian fortifications.
BERLIN, Aug.' 29.â German military
men are discussing the* situation of
General Kurorjatkin with, the keenest
interest. They have information that
the defenses of Liaoyang are of ex
traordinary strength. The fortifying
of the town was entrusted to General
Melishtko, who enjoys 1 here the repu
tation of being a. master of military
engineering.
During the past two months he has
fortified all the strategic positions
around Liaoyang in a mariner well
nigh impregnable.- Triple lines of
trenches crown every height where ar
tillery could be effective. The entire
line . of fortifications is connected
through passages for facilitating the
reinforcement of endangered points,
while bomb proof retreats covered with
steel rails protect reserves. All impor
tant points have telegraphic communi
cation with headquarters.
The German critics believe* Liao
yang's defenses about equalize the dif
ference in numbers between the Rus
sians â estimated at 180,000â and the j
Japanese, numbering 240,000.
The danger of General Kuropatkin's
situation is recognized as being bottled j
up like Field Marshal Bazaine, who sur- j
rendered Metz to the German forces in j
1S70. It is doubted by the experts if j
General Kuropatkin will be able to j
prevent the complete encircling of
Liaoyang, which would mean, probab- ;
ly. the eventual loss of his entire army. i

It is said that fort No. o has changed

front at this fort with sand bags. The
Japanese are using thousands of Chin

The information received here dur

firm the belief that the great Japan
e.->- assault upon Port Arthur, which
was begun on August 20. was by no
means as successful as was expected.
Although the Japanese succeeded in
pushing their lines forward they were
unable in any instance to occupy the
important po*it!<vns from which they
had driven the Russians. They suc

HEAVY ASSAULTS UPON PORT ARTHUR'S EASTERN DEFENSES
CHEFU, Aug. 29. â Chinese arriving from Dalny say that on August 20, 21 and 22 heavy
assaults were made on the east flank of the Port Arthur defenses. It is asserted that the Japanese
losses in these attacks reached 10,000 men. Two succeeding days were occupied in disposing of
the dead. About 100 Chinese refugees from'Dahiy have reached Chefu within the last few hours.
They confirm the report that their countrymen at Dalny fear a Russian movement from the north.
Many of the newcomers are merchants who failed in their attempts to carry on business at Dalny
under Japanese rule. This and similar facts are changing the attitude of the Chinese commercial

that there has not been a single case
of truancy since the school began, and
this is considered remarkable in view
of the fact that some of the pupils are
regarded as inccrrigiblcs. Miss Rae

as the classes taught Include the grades
from the first to the eighth. In all
likelihood one of the substitute teach

Another suggestion was made to cut
canals connecting the Tuba and Bear
rivers, so that the combined water
would flow through the American Basin
into the Sacramento near the mouth of
the Feather River.
It is impossible to eliminate the de
posits of debris from the mining re
gions, he said. To such an extent has
this evil grown that in many places in
Suisun-Bay where previously banks
were twenty feet below the surface they
are now commencing to appear on tht
surface. The hearing will be continued
at 10 o'clock to-day.
The engineers' commission for the in
vestigation of the flood regions of the
Sacramento River resumed its hearing
yesterday morning at the Flood build
ing.
The entire attention of the board
was taken up by Marsden Manson,
an engineer and expert of this city,
who appeared before the commission to
give his view on the obviation of floods
and tha reclamation of swamp lands.
In the opinion of Manson the only
way to cut canals in order to carry off
the debris that comes from the head
waters and the mines is to parallel the
course o? the river, and not to con
struct at right angles to any part of
its flow. In other words, where the
bends of the river are east and west
canals may be cut north and south to
lateral bends farther down the river.
Where the bends are north and south
the river will accomplish its own pur
pose with the aid of the constructed
canals.
One cut in particular was recom
mended to save much land from being
flooded. A canal from the Sacramento
at Grays Bend, above the Feather Riv
er, to the Sacramento at the Elkhorn
ranch, below the Feather River, would,
in the opinion of Manson, facilitate in
carrying deposits toSuisun Bay.

Miss Carl returns to America to find
herself famous, but flatterers will lind
her a poor subject for their attentions.
"If this prominence had come as ths
result of my work itself I might enjoy
it." shs says, "but most of the people I
meet have never seen a mark from my
brush. My fame has gone forth because
I happened to paint a famous woman.
The pleasure was mine, but I would
be very blind if I allowed myself to
take any credit for it."
While in this country Miss Carl is
under engagement to paint several por
traits, and will probably remain in
America about two years.
Miss Carl, who met the Dowager
through Minister Conger, found in the
aged ruler a sister in art. The Em
press is something of a painter herself,
and on this ground of common interest
a warm friendship sprang up. Misa
Carl spent two years at the palace and
in that time made four portraits of tK-
Empress. The one sent to St. Louis
with su much ceremony was the most
conventional and. so Miss Carl declares,
the least interesting.
Miss Katherine Augusta Carl, the
American woman who painted the
famous portrait of the Dowager Em
press of China, arrived here yesterday
from the Orient. Miss Carl is going: to
St. Louis to join her brother, who ?s
one of China's commissioners to the
World's Fair.
"The Empress is the most maligned
woman on earth." said Miss Carl yes
terday. "She has been painted as worse
than one of the legendary dragons of
Chinese lore, when, as a matter of fact,
she is one of the dearest, gentlest
women it has ever been my good for
tune to meet. I had exceptionally goo-1
opportunities of judging, and 1 know
that I am right when I say that the
Empress is neither cruel nor selfish."
Democrats Meet at Keddins.
REDDING. Aug. 29.â Peter Peterson
was nominated for the Assembly on the
Democratic ticket in the Fourth Dis
trict, composed of Shasta. Modoc and
Lassen counties, at a joint Assembly
convention held at Redding this after
noon. Edward Riebe of Redding, who
had been daced in nomination, with
drew in favor of Peterson.
The Republican nominee for the As
sembly in thi3 district is J. H. Creigh
ton. a Redding attorney. The district
is nominally Democratic.
Dr. Francis E. Fremantle, who ar
rived here yesterday on the Coptic, is
an English physician who has been
makingr a tour of the world, studying
sanitary and hospital conditions, espe
cially with a view to the investigation
of tropical diseases. Dr. Fremantle
has a practice in London and is health
officer for the county of Hertford.
He spent six months in India when
the plague was at its worst. During
one week he was there 50,000 deaths
were recorded. He visited the Malay
Peninsula, and spent some time study
ing beri-beri in Siam and at Singapore.
He arrived at Tokio in the middle of
June and speaks highly* of Japan's mil
itary hospitals. The Japanese women
nurses he specially commends. He vis
ited Fusan, Tientsin, Newchwang, Che
fu, Sasebo and Hiroshima.
At Xewehwang he witnessed the bat
tle of Tashihchai from the house tops
and at the naval hospitals at Sasebo
saw many victims of the war. More
than M per cent of the wounds, he says
were caused by shells. There were few
shell wounds in the Spanish and Boe'"
wars and this is really the first time
that an opportunity has been given for
the study of (his class of wounds under
modern medical treatment. The study
so far has shown that the wounds can
be classed as great lacerations, usually
proving fata!; flesh wounds, extremely
painful but not dangerous, and burns.
Hiroshima is the chief center for the
Japanese military wounded. Here Dr
Fremantle saw more than 4000 patients
He says that -the bulUts used both by
Japanese and Russians, judging bv the
wounds, are quite 'humane."
Dr. Fremantle has written a detailed
report of his work for the British Med
ical Journal.

TRAGEDY LEAVES EFFECTS

iiml Hlmsrlf Haled Before
Widow of Man Who Killed Daughter
I.unacr Hoar # !
SAN JOSE. Aug. 29.â A tragedy that
occurred in this city a few years ag"
may have affected the mind of Mrs.
Annie Rodriguez, the sole survivor of
the StoHe family, which figured In thÂ»
sensation. To-day she was examined
as to her mental condition. Dr3. F. C.
Gerlach and M. S. Silva. who examined
the woman, recommended that she be
committed to the Agnew Insane Asy
lum. Judge Hyland. however, differed
from the physicians and continued the
matter till Thursday.
On January 10. 1901. Robert Stolle. a
Herman gardener residing at 90S East
Julian street, killed his 13-year-old
daughter Bertha, set fire to the house
to hide the crime and then killed him
self. Mrs. Stolle. now Mrs. Rodriguez,
had fled from the house a few hours
before to save her own hie. Stolle left
a note saying that he had been driv-n
to the crime by his wife.
Three years ago Mrs. Stolle married
Joe Rodriguez, a Portuguese. Their
life has not been a happy one. and the

As an exaninle of the work of this
institute: Shortly after the soldiers
began to talie the field in the present
war it was discovered that many of the
horses were dying of anthrax. The
matter was referred to Kitazato and
within a short time he was prepared
to inoculate the animals with an anti
anthrax vaccine. Every horse sent to
the front after that was inoculated
twice and when Kitazato left Japan
the institute had turned out. under his
direction, more than 23,000 dozen doses
of the vaccine.
Kitazato speaks only German in ad
dition to Japanese. He looks more
like a prosperous monev king than a
scientist and the passengers on the
Coptic found him cxtremelr compan
ionable.
Soon after Kitazato returned tx>
Japan the island kingdom was visited
by the bubonic plague and it was in
righting the pestilence that he located
the plague bacillus, a discovery which
has been of infinite value in handling
subsequent epidemics.
Kitazato is now at the head of a
government institute founded for the
purpose cf making scientific investiga
tion of anything of national impor
tance.
Of all the men that have "done
things," one of the most interesting
and whose work has been most ""worth
while" is Dr. S.' Kitazato, the world
famous Japanese bacteriologist, who
arrived here yesterday on the liner
Coptic. Kitazato's name is familiar
wherever the secrets of science are
seriously searched after. In the school
of bacteriological research his name
stands side by side with that of Pro
fessor Koch, the great German savant,
in whose laboratories in Berlin Kita
zato spent seven years. In Japan Kit
azato is credited with knowledge illim
itable: to all the world he is as nearly
an absolute, authority as humankind
can be.
In company with other distinguished
people Kitazato is on his way to St.
Louis to attend the consress of arts
and sciences. He leaves for the East
to-morrow and before returning to
Japan will visit. President Roosevelt
Kitazato's name received its first
general prominence when he discovered
the bacillus of tetanus. v/as dur
ing the time he was working with Pro
fessor Koch. The latter, however, gives
all the credit for the discovery to his
Japanese confrere, who solved the
problem alone on lines of his own lay
ing.
Nobushige Hozumi. who arrived
here yesterday on the liner Coptic,
is the leading legal lijrht of Japan.
He is president of the law depart
ment of the Imperial University at
Tokio. He is traveling with Dr.
Kitazato and with him will attend tht
Congress of Arts and Sciences.
Professor Hozumi read law in
London, where he -was admitted as a
barrister to the Inner Temple. Ho
zumi belongs to a family that has
done much toward the advancement
of Janan. When Commodore Perry
first went to Japan he was enter
tained by one of the professor's an
cestors, to whom the naval officer
presented an English dictionary.
That dictionary was treated se
riously. It was handed from member
to member of the family, and from it
th2 Hozumis made their first acquain
tance with the English language.
That book is still in the family.
When Hozumi returned to Japan
he soon made his way to the front
ranks and was one of the twelve law
yers selected some years ago to re
vise the constitution.
The Imperial University at Tokio is
attended bv 4000 students. It offers
courses in medicine, law, engineering,
literature, science and agriculture.
There is another smaller Government
university at Kioto, over the law de
partment of which Professor Hozumi
exercises a long-distance supervision.
There was another famous Japan
ese on the Coptic, Miss Gyokashi
Atowi. She is one of Japan's most
famous artists, and is also heading
for the consresa at St. Louis. Jap
anese art is in a school by itself, and
Miss Atowi is in trvo Mm class. In
Japan her name is a household word,
and yesterday, when a party of local
Japanese. Was presented to the lady
there v/as an exhibition of bowing
and sniffling that looked for a while as
if it would never end. Each little
brown gentleman rolled his eyes and
bowed as only a Japanese can at least
nine times. Between each bow there
was a peculiar sniffling: inhalation of
the breath. But the lady liked it, and
for every bow and each sniffle she had
a rweet.' oriental smile.

W. b. Kennedy in a quarrel over the

Continuing his remarks. Judge Hall
said: "The man has not impressed
me as being a criminal. The jury did
right in finding him guilty. This was
in accordance with the testimony. But
the act was wholly unpremeditated and
it was a coincident that he happened
to have the pistol with him at the time
he got into this trouble. I think that
justice will be served by a sentence of
eighteen months in the County Jail
Instead of attaching the odium of a
term in the State Prison, and I shall
so order."

OAKLAND, Aug. 29. â After a separ
ation of nearly thirty years, A. L. Lar
kin, an old miner, who is now an in
mate of the King's Daughters' Home
in this city, and his daughter, Mrs.
Minnie K. Bissell. have been reunited
under circumstances which might eas
ily form the plot of a romantic drama.
The happiness of both, however, -was
tempered with sadness,* for the father,
who has not seen his child since he
left her, a tiny baby in her mother's
arnif, will never see her face, for he
is totally blind.
In 1874 Larkin departed from his
home in Iowa to seek a fortune in the
mines. He left his wife and daughter,
then a baby less than a year old, fairly
well provided for, hoping to return to
them a rich man. Fortune failed to
smile upon him and for years he wan
dered from one to another of the min
ing camps of Colorado, New Mexico

Finally his letters home remained un

west he gradually lost all trace of hia
wife and child. In 1898 Larkin came
to California and finally located at the
Berlin mine, near Austin, Nevada.
this city. While confined to his room
at the hospital Larkin was often vis
ited by Dr. Nelson Bissell, then a stu
dent at Cooper Medical College. ' Af
ter he was able to get out the old man
' often walked past the latter's home.
Little did he dream that the wife of
the young student, the mother of two
boys, whose shouts he had often heard
while passing the house, was the
daughter whom he had left nearly thir
ty years ago.
After coming to Oakland Larkin for
got this student acquaintance, who
meantime was graduated from Cooper
College and entered upon the practice
of medicine. In June, 1903, after Lar
kin had been an inmate of the King's
Home for more than a year.
Miss L. Gilbert of AlamedK visited the
home to call upon one of the inmates,
a friend of the old miner. She met
Larkin, who, when he heard her name,
remarked that he had a cousin of that
name who. when he last heard of him,
was living in Iowa. â¢"Why," said Miss
Gilbert, "Iowa was my father's home."
Further conversation revealed the fact
that the young lady was the daughter
of Larkin's cousin, T. M. Gilbert, who
had come to California several years
ago, and was killed two years ago while
working for the Southern Pacific Com
pany.
On learning that Larkin had not
heard from his family for several years
Miss Gilbert wrote to a relative in
Iowa telling of her discovery, and from
this relative came the news that the
old man's only daughter was married
and was living in San Francisco. Miss
Gilbert wrote to Mrs. Bissell and she
at once came to Oakland to investigate
the story. What was her surprise to
discover that the old miner, whom she
had several times visited in company
with her husband, was her own father.

Will Consider Placing of Voting Ma
chines at Special Meeting: of
Snb- Co mini ttee,
The Board of Election Commission
ers met last night at the City Hall
principally for the purpose of consid
ering the placing of tho voting ma
chines. Commissioners Devoto, Lef
fingwell and McGulre agreed to mr ->t
next Wednesday night to consider their
disposal.
Some time was consumed In reading
the minutes of the two preceding meet
ings of the board. Following that cams
the submission of a report by Thomas
W. Hickey of the Democratic County
Committee. Mr. Hickey submitted a
list of candidates that had been in
dorsed by the County and State Cen
tral committees for the positions of
election officers. President Roberts de
murred at accepting the list, as he in
timated it barred any Democrat who
might be willing to serve, but who did
not have the indorsement of the gov
erning Democratic committees. After
much verbal sparring by President
Roberts and Mr. Hickey. who was aid
ed by Chairman Timothy H. Spellacy,
the list was placed on file to be inves
tigated and considered.
The board granted the request of
W. L. Harper of the Thirty-ninth As
sembly District to hold a precinct reg
istration on September 14 at 1463 For
ty-ninth avenue.
Rewards of $250 will be offered by the
board for the arrest of any person vio
lating the election laws and $23 for
any one destroying election property
during the coming election.
The board then adjourned to meet
Monday evening, September 12, at 8
o'clock.

An interesting exhibit of cotton
plants In all their various stages of
development is being made at Hale

Arrangements were completed some
time ago by the management of the es

Orleans for the shipment of a quantity
of cotton plants from incipiency to full
bloom. These have been installed in
the grand court of Hale Brothers' large

availing themselves of the opportunity
to see for the first time how cotton
grows.
Over the court a troupe of colored
singers warble Southern lays of the
cotton fields. The exhilbit will doubt

The corona of the sunâ not the sun
itselfâ weighs something like 25,000,000
tons, so Professor August Svante Ar
rhenius of the University of Stockholm
has discovered after making a visit to
the great Lick Observatory at Mount
Hamilton.
Of course, Professor Arrhenius has
not computed the weight of this enor
mous mass by any such insignificant
scales as there are on this earth. The
scales he did use are of the intellectual
kind, utilized in handling big problems
and big figures. In other words, the
scales were his brains and the tools
were the atmosphere, the temperature
and the telescope.
To Professor Arrhenius and the rest
of the astronomers 1*5,000,000 tons, it
seems, isn't much for the corona of the
sun to weigh. In fact, they are sur
prised that it is thus shown to be so
exceedingly light, considering that it
occupies a space whose dimensions in
every direction amount to several mil
lions of miles.
Besides computing the weight of the
corona Professor Arrhenius settled one
other great problem that has puzzled
the astronomers for a long time. This
problem concerns the sources of the
coronal light, over which two schools of
astronomers disagreed. For instance.
Professor W. W. Campbell, director of
the Lick Observatory, and Astronomer
Perrine, his assistant, held the view
that the light of the inner portions of
the corona is due to the radiation from
minute dust particles maintained at a
temperature of incandescence by the
enormous heat of the adjacent solar
surface, and that the light from the
outer corona is composed mainly of
sunlight reflected and diffracted by the
colder dust particles composing thia
part of the corona. These conclusions
were based upon the character of the
spectrum of the corona.
On the other hand the observers of the
Smithsonian Institution measured the
quantity of heat from the corona and
were surprised to find that, even in the
immediate proximity of solar surface
the effective temperature was sub
stantially that of the room in which
they were observing. They therefore
held the view that the main source of
light from the corona is not the in
candescence of its particles, but that
the radiations are in the nature of an
electrical discharge.
Professor Arrhenius. however, has
succeeded in harmonizing all the re
sults of observations by showing that
the particles in the region observed
must be at a temperature of; about 8000
degrees Fahrenheit and therefore must
be radiating light by virtue of their in
candescence; but that the particles are
so few and far between that the ef
fective temperature observed is not the
temperature of the particles them
selves, but is the average temperature
for the incandescent particles and the
cold background of space upon which
these particles are seen, here and there,
in projection. The total area of the
background covered by the particles In
projection is but a minute fraction of
the whole area. The spectroscopic
and thermometric observations are
completely harmonized by assuming
that, in the part of the corona ob
served, there is but one minute dust
particle for each fifteen cubic yards of
space.

"We have heard all sorts of knocks
on this proposition, and we know their
origin. I will say for the board that we
will give this matter the most careful
consideration. We do not intend to
take any action until we have made a
thorough Investigation. We are com
mitted to this proposition, and I believe
it will be one of the finest advertise
ments for the county that was ever
proposed. We have acquired the neces
sary right of way, and all we have to
do now is to see to the building of the
road and that it is properly done."
Four bids were received this morning
by the Board of Supervisors for the
construction of the scenic boulevard be
tween Oakland and Haywards. The
lowest bid for doing the work was sub
mitted by the Ransome Construction
Company for the sum of $300,000, which
is $1000 less than the estimated cost of
the work as reported County Sur
veyer Prather, who had the drawing of
all the plans for the road and esti
mated that it would cost $301,000 to
build. The other bids were: Oakland
Paving Company, $305,000; E. B. & A.
L,. Stone Company, $324,500: Pacific
Construction Company, $397,973.
The ontract for the work will not be
let until September 6. In the meantime
the bids will be investigated to see that
they are according to the requirements.
The payment for the work has been
provided for by special tax levy, and it
is expected that in three years the work
will bo finished. It is intended to make
this one of the famous drives of the
State. It will be a broad boulevard, 100
feet in width and twelve miles in
length, and will follow the contour of
the foothills at a sufficient elevation
to give a magnificent view of the coun
try surrounding San Francisco Bay.
A protest against the letting of the
contract for the work has been received
by the board from the Alameda County
Advancement Association, which asked
that action be deferred. In some re
marks passed upon this communica
tion by Chairman Mitchell he said:

Though Heine denied that he knew
anything about the missing wife's
whereabouts, he said he had been
engaged by her to move her trunk to
Berkeley. He refused to say where
the trunk had been taken. It was not
long after Detective Quigley met
Heine that Mrs. Organ appeared at the
City Prison. She refused to say where
she had been stopping. ' Concerning
the insanity affidavit. Mrs. Organ
averred that she had been abused by
her spouse and for that reason she
had left home.
Claiming that his wife, Mrs. Myr
tle Organ, had been spirited away
from home after he had sworn to a
c-omplaiht for her arrest as insane,
William C. Organ, residing at 1416
San Pablo avenue, applied to-day to
the police for help in locating the
missing woman, who had been away
from home since Friday.
Organ declared his belief that W.
F. Heine, a carpet beater, residing at
2611 Shattuck avenue, Berkeley, knew
where Mrs. Organ was concealed.
Detective Quiglcy made an investi
gation this morning and after a long
but unsatisfactory interview with
Heine returned to police headquarters.
The detective said he was satisfied
Heine knew where the woman could
be found. Quigley's theory proved to
be correct. Early this afternoon Mrs.
Organ appeared at the City Prison
and surrendered herself. She was
taken to the detention ward at the Re
ceiving Hospital and held for examin
ation by the Lunacy Commissioners.
Mrs. Organ is 25 years old. Her
husband says his wife has tried to kill
herself on several occasions by but
ting her head against a wall and by
cutting herself with a pair of scis
sors.

Chairman Babcock Says Congressional
Campaign Is Close.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29.â Chairman.
Joseph Babcock of the Republican Con
gressional Committee to-day expressed
the opinion that the present was the
closest Congressional campaign he had
known since 1898.
"What are the conditions which make
the Congressional campaign closer this
year than it has been since 189S?" Bab
cock was asked.
"They differ in localities," he re
sponded. "In some the conditions re
sult from the character of the national
campaign. In others the conditions are
almost entirely local. Then, in some
cases, the difficulty Is over the Kind of
men nominated for Congress. In Neb
raska, where there are six members of
the House to fight for, the Democrats
have abandoned the national cam
paign. They have fused with the Pop
ulists on the Legislative and Congres
sional tickets, but not on Presidential
electors. Nearly all Congressional dis
tricts in the State are close. We re
deemed four of those districts two
years ago, but they have been going
one way or the other by very narrow
marginsâ not by 200 or 300 or 400, but
in some instances by 12 or 15 or 20
votes. Now the Congressional com
mittee has to go in there without the
usual supporting national committee.
"We expect to have a good deal of
speaking. There are about a dozen of
the leading Republican members of the
House on whom we are relying. Chief
among them, of course, is Speaker Can
non, who is a splendid vote getter on
the stump. He Is going to start out
soon by special train and will be ac
companied on a part of his trip by
Representative Watson of Indiana and
on the rest of his trip by Representa
tive Adam Bede of Minnesota."*

St. Loui9 to the Washington monu

abrupt end at this place. Professor
George C. Tomlinson of Syracuse, N.

bag, much to the entertainment of the
town and country folk. Professor Carl
Meyer of Frankfort, his contestant, had
come back to earth at St. Charles, Mo.,
twenty-two miles out of St. Loui%,
nearly a day earlier.
Tomlinsonâ or rather his balloon â
was sighted over Wyoming at 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. It was a mere

the eastward. An hour later it drop

a pasture seven miles southeast of
here.
Curious persons set out Immediately
in pursuit of the airship and brought
Tomlinson and his Capitol-bound bal

accustomed himself to mundane ex

an earthly breakfast and then packed
the balloon in its wicker basket, pre
paratory to returning to St. Louis. He

Special Dispatch to The Ca!L
SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 29.â William B.
Bradbury, the millionaire, was arrested
this afternoon by Constable Louis
Hughes on a charge of assault pre
ferred by Mrs. Catherine Hanitin. He
was released on a $2500 bail bond fur
nished by S. H. Cheda, a local banker,
and John F. Allen of Corte Madera.
Mr. and Mrs. E. J. Hanifin, in re
sponse to an advertisement for a hus
band and wife, came to work for Brad
bury about three weeks ago. She was
to do the housework and her husband
the outside work at Bradbury's Corte
Madera home. In the complaint she
alleges that on the morning of the 20th,
while she was working in the kitchen
and her husband was working outside.
Bradbury attempted to assault her.
She alleges she ran outside immedi
ately and informed her husband, and
then went with him to San Rafael for
legal advice.
Bradbury is highly indignant over
the charge. He said to-day: "I never
knowingly insulted the woman, but
possibly I may have when I offered her
a dollar for performing her work well.
1 frequently give my servants sums of
money when they perform their duties
well."
Bradbury says he will fight the case
to a finish, as he is guiltless. The pre
liminary examination has been set for
10 a. in. Thursday in Justice Magee's
< ourt at San Rafael.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Aug. 23.â A rec^ntly
fcisned will, jewels and other personal
property of the late Mrs. James H. ilc
yicker. amounting to 52S0,y00, were
found to-day in a safe deposit vault in
the possession of the Illinois Trust and
Savings Bank, by Colonel Joseph H.
Strong, administrator of the estate.
After having been appointed admin
istrator by the Probate Court in the
morning. Colonel Strong opened the
box in the presence of Horace SIcVlclc
it, the stepson. Attorney L. D. Condee
;ind officials of the institution.
Horace McVicker raid to-r.ight that
the will would be opened -to-morrow.
From the recent date upon it he be
lieves it probable that persons who
have been recently very influential with
Mrs. McVicker may bo favored, to the
prejudice of the original heirs.
Thousands of dollars' worth of heir
looms are absent from the safe deposit
box. but are believed to be among the
personal effects now guarded by Dr. L.
C H. E. 2eig:ler at Pasadena. Cal.
Mrs. ilcVicker's stepson, Horace Mc-
Vicker, now declares he is being ig
nored by both Dr. Zeigler and the other
claimants, one of whom is in California
waging a bitter warfare against Dr.
Zeisler's claims. Not one word reached
Hi/^ate McVicker to-day as to the late
developments of the sensational case.
He paced the floor of the Auditorium
Hotel all day, impatiently, waiting to
hear from Mrs. Sarah B. Game, his
rousin. or fiarry Wyatt. the California
theatrical man, who is representing
MoVieker at Pasadena, where the body
ii now under the guard of Dr. Zeie-ler.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 29.â The first
tangible clew of the whereabouts of F.
W. Montague and Dan Kelly, the des
perate convicts who escaped from San
Quentin last Friday, was obtained to
day, when Richard McCurdy of Bolinas
reported to Sheriff Taylor that he had
spoken to the escaped men at Bolinas.
McCurdy drives the stage which plies
between San Rafael and Bolinas. Yes
terday forenoon two strangers appeared
in town .and asked McCurdy the near
est way to reach the cars for San Fran
cisco. He directed them, and after
strolling around town the men took
their departure. McCurdy thought
nothing more of the Incident until Vic
tor Collwell, a resident of the town, re
marked to him that he thought the
strangers were the- San Quentin es
capes.
Later in the day Dave McCurdy re
turned to Bolinas from San Rafael and
informed his brother that he had seen
two suspicious characters walking? to
ward Ross station and when they saw
him they stepped into the brush.
Richard McCurdy when shown the
photographs of the men at San Rafael
to-day positively identified them. The
supposition is that the men took the D
o'clock train at Ross station last night
for San Francisco.

SHERIFF IS INFORMED
CAPITALIST INDIGNANT
SENSATION IS EXPECTED
Prior to the marriage of her brother,
Alexander X. McVicker, it was the
privilege of Mrs. John Bulger to go
to his grocery, 50 Chesley street, and
there help herself to as much kerosene
as she might happen to need for the
artificial illumination of her home, 324
Harriet street. Such a thing as pay
ing for the coal oil never occurred to
her,,r.or did he ever think of such a
thing as demanding payment for it.
There was tacit understanding that the
Bulger home was to be provided with
petroleum at Mr. McVicker's expense.
After the grocer took unto himself a
wife and installed her in the store Mrs.
Bulger continued to tap the kerosene
barrel until Mrs. McVicker coldly in
formed her that the liquid thus ob
tained must be paid for at the pre
vailing retail rate. When Mrs. Bulger
recovered from her indignant surprise
she appealed tocher brother, but that
gentleman adroitly sidestepped the is
sue. Then Mrs. Bulger went home and
told her husband that if he had one
remaining spark of manhood he would
exhibit it by disciplining Mrs. Mc-
Vicker. Mr. Bulger went to the gro
cery and asked Mrs. McVicker if she
realized that by cutting off from his
household its free light she was shat
tering a beautiful illustration of broth
erly love, to say nothing or the icpno
clasitt committed by abolishing a cus
tom that had become time-honored.
Mrs. McVicker's reply, according to
the testimony of Mr. Bulger yesterday
before Police Judge Cabaniss, was a
heavy beer glass hurled at him with
aim of such accuracy that it struck his
right side, inflicting a severe pain. Ere
he could retaliate with violence his
wife butted ia and dealt Mrs. Mc-
Vicker several right and left hooks on
the face, discoloring the lady's eyes.
But it was Mr. Bulger instead of his
wife whom Mrs. McVicker charged
with battery.
The Judge heard all the testimony
and then informed Mrs. McVicker, a
sharp featured little woman, that it
was her husband's sister and not his
brother-in-law that she should have
filed complaint against. To which Mrs.
Bulger, large-frai-.ed and muscular,
quickly responded by declaring that
she did not attack Mrs. McVicker until
that lady had landed a hard right upon
her jaw. What would the court have
her do â tamely turn the other cheek to
a person who had not only shut off
her supply of coal oil, but had severed
a friendship between brother and sis
ter that had existed since their child
hood?
"That's not the question at all, Mrs.
Bulger," said his Honor. "What we
are wrestling with is the guilt or in
nocence of your husband as he is
charged in this complaint. I am in
clined to consider him innocent and
pursuant to that inclination will con
tinue the case for thirty days. In the
meantime you might practice discretion
by procuring your coal oil at some
other grocery, even if you have to
pay for it."
The Rev. Father P. J. Grey, former
pastor of St. Patrick's Church, ap
peared in Judge Conlan's court as a
witness for the prosecution in the case
of Dr. Thomas F. Brennan, accused of
stealing $37,000 from the octogenarian
priest. Very feeble did the aged priest
appear as he sat upon the witness
stand and answered the questions put
to him by the attorneys. The apparent
object of the defense was to prove his
memory defective and his testimony
incompetent, but on all the important
points of the accusation he seemed to
have clear recollection. His examina
tion consumed several hours and at its
conclusion he was taken from the
courtroom by a medical attendant from
St. Joseph's Hospital, who had stood
close to him constantly and watched
him with solicitous care throughout the
ordeal. The hearing will be resumed
to-morrow morning.
Harry Walton, confidence man. will
nrrt be permitted to ply his vocation
while the Knights Templar have the
town. About a year ago he was or
dered to depart the city and never re
turn, but he came back with apparent
intention to operate during the coming
conclave and was so indiscreet as to
allow himself to' be seen by one of the
detectives who are under special in
struction to look out for such charac
ters as he and run them in. Judge
Fritz pronounced him guilty of va
grancy and will sentence him this
morning.
Mrs. Julia Duffy, accused of disturb
ing the peace of her daughter-in-law,
Mrs. Annie Duffy, was sentenced to
thirty days' Imprisonment by Judge
Cabaniss, despite a fervent renewal of
her plea that she had abandoned the
"Horses and Carts" and cast her po
litical lot with the McNabbites. Mrs.
Terrier and two other matrons testi
fied that the defendant's character was
not as dark as her alleged conduct
might indicate or her daughter-in-law
had depicted it, but the unalterable
fa<:t .remained that she repeated the
very offense which the court had
warned her against a few days prior
to her rearrest. So for thirty days at
least there is likely to be peace in the
Duffy home, on Guy place.
Elsie Barker made her third ap
pearance within as many weeks before
Judge Conlan on the charge of drunk
enness and it was as much in sorrow
as in anger that his Honor gave her
the limit â six months' imprisonment.
She is a young and rather good look
ing woman, who left her parents'
home at Redding to seek employment
in the city and the companions she
took up with led her astray. At least
that was the story she told the Judge
on her first and second appearances
before him, and each time he believed
it and dismissed her on her promise
to return to Redding immediately.
The Salvation Army tried to restore
her to the stranght path, but she
spurned their reformatory efforts and
was drunk when a policeman arrested
her last Saturday night on Fifth street.
James M. Gallagher, who was among
the striking hackmen, told Judge Fritz
that as soon as he obtains work he
will provide for his minor child. Now
that the strike is over, he added, he
expects to be employed within a very
few days, and as soon as he gets con
trol of a hack he will swear off drink
ing and turn his weekly wages over to
the court, so that they may be divided
justly among those dependent upon
them for maintenance. Then he was
dismissed.

Harry Morrison mounted Frank
Sylvester's bootblack stand at Fifth
and Mission streets last Saturday
afternoon and indulged in the luxury
of a "shine." When his attention was
called to the fact, that his shoestrings
were defective he cheerily instructed
Mr. Sylvester to go ahead and sup
plant them with new ones, but when
the instruction was obeyed he declined
to pay 5 cents for the substitutes,
opining that the 10 cents which he
paid for the shine was intended to de
fray all incidentals.
"Why," he argued, "you might with
equal unreason charge me 5 cents for
rolling UD\my trousers legs or brush
ing my hat. - The shoestrings I con
sider an extra thrown in for courtesy's
sake. To charge anything for them
I consider attempted extortion."
According to the testimony heard by
Judge Conlan, before whom Mr. Mor
rison and Mr. Sylvester were charged
with having disturbed the peace by
lighting, the bootblack attempted to
recover the new strings he had placed
in Mr. Morrison's shoes and was
kicked on the head by that gentleman.
Mr. Sylvester retaliated by plucking a
footrest from its socket and smiting
Mr. Morrison's head, and Mr. Mor
rison was endeavoring to equip himself
with a similar weapon when Patrol
man J. W. Doyle happily arrived and
r.rrested both combatants. They will
be sentenced to-day.
After consuming the contents of a
tall and portly steam beer glass in a
saloon at Fourth and Townsend streets,
Edward Swanson fancied the vessel a3
a souvenir and attempted to take it
away without the bartender's permis
sion. In the ensuing conflict he lost
possession of the glass and received
several hard punches from a trained
fist, so Judge Conlan gave him only
ten days for disturbing the peace.
Joseph Sullivan, who was arrested
on the Barbary Coast while he was
masquerading as a man-o'-war Jackie,
reappeared before Judge Cabaniss yes
terday in civilian garb and reiterated
his former Dlea that he had donned
the naval uniform for a bal masque
given by "the Easy Dues Club" last
Friday evening.
"And if the press cares to remedy
an' error," he added, "it might say that
the club's headquarters is at 333 Noe
street."
After he had explained that "the
Easy Dues" is an outgrowth of the
once famous "Booze Club," Mr. Sul
livan was dismissed from custody.
Fred Bert, whose larcenous specialty
was the pilfering of artisans' tools
from buildings in course of construc
tion, has started to r.erve six months'
imprisonment for allowing himself to
bo caught in the act of stealing a saw
belonging to Charles Gallagher, car
penter. Judge Conlan imposed the
sentence.
Addison and Harvey Case, brothers,
roughly treated a boy named Vene
zuela, who tried to serve a court sum
mons addressed to them, and Judge
Fritz will talk to them this morning.
Julia J. Udell, charged with drunk
enness, smiled benignly upon Judge
Conlan. leaned her right elbow upon
the corner of his desk, where it had
often rested before, and bade him
good morning. He returned the saluta
tion .and asked if she thought thirty
days would be too much.
"It's up to you." replied Julia.
"You know me, and I know that you'll
do the right thing."
"Whatever's right, eh?" said hi3
Honor.
Julia nodded pleasantly.
"Then let's say thirty â thirty It is."
"Thanks: take good care of your
self," chirruped Julia as she nimbly
tripped back to the bench.
Frank Spayles. whose alcoholic pen
chant is the chasing and terrifying of
small children, was given eighty days
by Judge Conlan for having pursued,
overtaken and beaten a little boy who
gave no provocation whatever for the
assault.

without %aÂ£tix.g a mcrr.ent began kick
::.o ar:d fallir.g on the pigskin. - It was
lh rilling, and more to when the "root
trk" gut to 'heir feet and gave the
"Osu Wow \\*o-.v:"
Tberts were ton-.e old faces in uniform
i.:*d lot* of new ones. Of the old guard,
bct-iies Captain Stroud, there were
"Grefck" Howard and E. Stern only.
"LitiJe" Mini wa.s there in uniform, but
he is only going to help coach. Heit
mu!!'-r, who ia exj^cted to help out on
tl."< Use this year, wasn't there, and
nr.ther were Tom Kisley nor Olie Sned
lgÂ»3 nor "Jim" Force nor Reno De
tneritt. all m*n counted on to give a
hi-r.d this year.
Coach "Jimmy" Hopper was in the
. middle- of the doings with his towzled
tosrbead ar.d machine-like ways. Hop
. i-*-r hadn't time to even talk ghop to
bis newspaper friends eager for hi3
views. In a Jiffy he had the herd di
vi'j'd ir.to cunipa ar.d falling on the
ball as it was roiled this way and that.
This sort of practice he noon substitut
ed for running down the field in the
fdfe of a friendly enemy and getting
after a kicked ball. The whole thing
â¢..:.!>â¢ lasted half an hour and then the
Â¦quad was sent back to the "gym."
Hopper doesn't believe in too much
training at first, as it has a tendency to
tend the men Ftale.
Hopper** methods of handling the
squad met with the approval of the
bleachem. It is taken for granted that
he is Â«oing to develop the fastest team
QiOUlble out of the material at the uni
verrity this year. In the face of Stan
ford's array of veterans a fast team is
Ihe only thing and Hopper knows this
too wÂ«l. He has already begun to
check a tendency to the offside play
that turned out to he so disastrous to
Ia:-t y'-argS varsity team. The men that
got ahead of the bail this afternoon
v.hÂ«Â»n they had no business to were
"called down" good and hard. And
that's what the bleachers like.
President Wheeler gave the bleachers
a good heart to heart talk during the
course' Of the afternixm. The founda
tion of Jt all. he said, lies in doing

The standing broad jump brought out
a field that has never been eaualed in
the history of American athletics. The
first jump, that of C. M. King of Mc-
Kiriney. Tex., exceeded the Olympic
record by three-fifths of an inch. Ray
Ewry of the New York Athletic Club,
holder of the Olympic and world's
records, followed and on his first jump
beat the Olympic record and came
within two inches of equaling the
world's record, with a jump of 11 feet
2 inches. Ewry demonstrated that his
championship form had not deserted
him and established a new world's rec
ord of 11 feet 4 7-S inches. His jumps
were as follows: 11 feet 2 inches, 11
feet 2\4 Inches, 11 feet 4^4 inches,
breaking his own world's record of 11
feet 4 inches, and 11 feet 4 7-8 inches.
While the record established in Paris
by G. IV. Ortin of the University of
Pennsylvania for the 2500-meter
steeplechase %ras not seriously endan
gered, that event proved one of the
most interesting of the day's sport.
John J. Daly of Ireland sot off in the
lead and ran a magnificent race, but
was headed by James D. Lightbody of
the Chicago Athletic Association on the
last lap and beaten to the tape by a
scant margin. Summary:

The first Olympic record to go was
broken by John Flar.nagan of the
Greater New York Irish Athletic Asso
ciation, the holder. His first essay
with the 16-pound hammer resulted in
a. throw of 163 feet 1 inch, exceeding
the record made by him in Paris by
nine inches.
A burst of cheering followed the an
nouncement of the time in the first
heat of the sixty-meter run, seven sec
onds, as it equaled the record obtained
at the Paris revival of the Olympic
paints in 1&00. The second heat also
was run in record time, as was the
final.
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 23.â One world's
record was broken, two Olympic rec
ords were lowered and one Olympic
record was eaualed In the first day's

American sprinters, jumpers, distance
and weight men in the first events of

snent to lovers of sport for the next
wt-ek. There also were four handicap
events that resulted in more even com
petition and gave several close finishes.

each. He won the first heat handily,

and third to N'eergard in the third.
This was too much for the judges, and

card, the first, seven furlongs, going to
Dr. Shorb, the well-played favorite,
who won handily from Uppercut. Dr.

Lady Amelia was a better filly to
day than on Saturday and her bodily
condition was well nigh perfect. If
anything she was still a trifl> too soft
hi flesh, judging from the soapy lather
on her neck in her preliminary.
By no means high class was the
field, with the exception of the two
mentioned. It was expected that Lady
Amelia, aÂ« usual, would fio the pace
making. This she did, but, again as
usual, she began to come back, or per
haps it is more likely that Broomstick
was going the stronger. At any rate,
he won easily.
Among those beaten were Mineola,
which never had a chance in the early
part of the race â due, it is charged,
to interference by Divination.
The Flying handicap was at six fur
lor.gs and was run in 1:13 3-5. The
stake was worth 5 2675 to the win

Six years ago I had a severe attack d
Inflammatory. Rheumatism. I was laid op
in bed for six months, and the doctors J
had did me no good. They changed med-
icines every week and nothing they prt-
scribed seemed to help me. Finally I be-
gan the use of S . S. S. JIv knee and elbow
joints were swollen terribly, and at one
time my joints were so swollen and pain-
ful that I could not close them when
opened. I was so bad that I could not
move knee or foot. I was-getting discour-
aged, you may be sure, when I began S S

ued it, and to-day I am a soand well man
and have never had a return of the disease
S. S. S. purified my blood and cured me"
of this severe case of Rheumatism after
everything else had failed. I have rec-

the motion of counsel for Mrs. Gene

served on her in the suit of her hus

the ground that the jurat to the no

farther reason that service had not
been made by a properly delegated

ORION, Mich., Aug. 29. â Murder
and a dastardly attempt at conceal
ment is the theory of the local police
in the case of Maynard Bixby, whose
mutilated bodv was found on the
Michigan Central Railroad tracks near
Orion early to-day.
Bixby, who was 19 years of age.
lived with his parents in this city. He
was with friends when last seen. He
left them shortly after midnight, sud
denly pulling out his watch as he de
parted and saying that he was going
home. The watch was not found in
the clothing on the dead body and
this fact, coupled with the finding of
a blood-stained stone in the vicinity
of the tragedy, furnishes the evidence
of foul play upon which the police are
working.
Xinctccn-Year-Old Youth Is Thought
to Have Fallen Victim of Foul
Assassination.

NEW YORK, Aug. 29.â David B.
Hill's announcement of his retirement
from politics with the end of this year
was discussed by both Democrats and
Republicans yesterday as the political
sensation of the hour. It was agreed
on all sides that Hill must have an ob
ject in this step and the opinion gen
erally expressed was that he had taken
it for the double purpose of relieving
Judge Parker from embarrassment and
of furthering the candidacy c-f John B.
Stanchfield for Governor.
It is known that Hill believes that
Stanchfield is entitled to the Demo
cratic nomination this year after hav
ing run in a year when there was no
hope. Much opposition to Stanchfield
has been manifested on the ground
that he has been so closely associated
with Hill that ho would be controlled
by Hill in ease of his election. Stanch
field realizes this sentiment against
him and he is doing his best to eradi
cate it. He has lost no opportunity to
establish cordial relations with Tam
many Hall In the hope of removing its
distrust. In a speech to-day at the
meeting of the Commercial Travelers'
League at 597 Broadway, he said:
"I read in a paper yesterday that I
have been known as 'Dave Hill's man'
and Grout as 'Pat McCarren's man.*
In 1896 there were people up State who
saw fit to nominate me for Governor
and I was defeated by Tammany. In
1898 I was put up by Tammany and
defeated by the people up State. Now,
in 1904, they say that Tammany is
against me because Hill is said to be
with me. I think these acts show in
dependence of the person in whom the
public places confidence enough to
nominate him for a public office."
Governor Odell was asked what he
had to say regarding the retirement of
Hill. Â®
"I am very grateful to him for not
retiring until January 1," he replied.
"William F. Sheehan, chairman of the
Democratic National Executive Com
mittee, and Cord Meyer, chairman of
the Democratic State Committee, re
fused to make any comment on Hill's
course.

The Sierra brought a full cargo, many
passengers and shipment ol British
gold valued at $1.75<?.OO0.
The Sierra brought from Honolulu a
number of prominent people, and
among those that came from the Anti
podes were many well-known colonials.
A number of glob'j-trotters also trav
eled 'm the liner.
She arrived here bright and early
yesterday morning, was given prompt
ci^patch in quarantine- and while the
day was still young Captain Houdiette
ran the liner alongside her berth at the
Pacific street whavf with as much dash
?r.d ense as if she had been a navy
launch on her best behavior.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Sierra. Captain Houdlette. which
arrived yesterday from the Antipodes,
Â¦ â¢r.eountervd r.ome terrific weather dur
ing the early pan of her long voyage.
Heavy sales impeded the liner's jour
ney through the Tasman Sea, and two
tlaya aft^r leaving Auckland the ele
ments developed another npell of anger,
i-'rom August 14 to 16 tierce squalls
stirred up terrific seas. The Sierra ar
rived off Paso Piigo at 4 a. m. August
.'â¢. The sale was howling: at its worst.
C&ptait* Houdiette hove to the steam
hip and waited for four hours in hope
.ha' the storm would moderate. In
.^ttad of clearing, the weather got
worse, and as high peas were breaking
over the reefs it was deemed advisable
:<> omit the call at the Samoan port.
The weather bogan to cleaf August 17,
and for the remainder of the voyage

Acting upon the vigorous protest of the St. Louis Society for the Pre

decreed that henceforth dog be stricken from the menu "of the vjsiting

the trip to St. Louis was unprofitable without a view of the dog-eaters in

In the Palace of Agriculture is an
other log cabin associated with the
name of another distinguished Presi
dentâTheodore Roosevelt. This struc
ture has been brought from the plains
of North Dakota. It was Roosevelt's
horfie during the years 1SS3-86. when,
seeking the open prairies in search of
health, he settled down \s a cattle
rancher on- the banks of the Little
Missouri River, eight miles south of
Medora, in the heart of a romantic
region then abounding with big game.
Within the cabin are shown some of
his old possessionsâ well-worn overalls,
for example, now humorously labeled
"Roosevelt's Sunday trousers " the fa
vorite rocker in which he wrote "Hunt
ing Trips "of a Ranchman," and the
huge seat hewn out of a log in which
he rested outside after many a hard
day's work and watched the sun go
down. One of the logs that form the
hut shows a Maltese Cross. Roosevelt's
particular cattle brand, fashioned with
cartridge shells driven into the wood
with his own hand. Since coming to
St. Louis the cabin has acquired fur
ther interesting associations, for the
silver plate on the door was nailed
there by the President's daughter, and
her initials in brass-headed nails stud
one of the logs not far from the cross
made by her father twenty-years be
fore, when no one dreamed that he
would yet live to be the President of his
country.â Edmund Mitchell In The

THE plant garden of the Agricultural Department at Chico is already
in receipt of valuable and interesting stock. Mr. Swingle of the de
partment found a fine and large pistachio nut growing in Syria, where
it takes the place of the almond. Unlike the almond, it is not an early
bloomer, and so would escape the rains which often destroy an almond crop
?by preventing pollination of the flowers.
Mr. Swingle, being familiar with the climate of California, found it to so
ncayly resemble that of Syria as to make it possible to add this valuable
tree to our nut production. He found some good pistachio trees already
bearing in Alameda County, and at once initiated measures to introduce the
Syrian tree. The stocks for grafting have been grown in the department
gardens in Washington, and, being well rooted, a large consignment has been
bent to the Chico garden. There the plants to furnish buds and wood for
grafting will be produced, and the Pistachio Atlantica, from Algiers, will be
then planted as nursery stock for budding and grafting.
The terebinth, or turpentine tree, growing in Italy, is also botanically
allied to the pistachio, and is used for grafting stock. There .is no doubt
but the Chico garden will be the means of effectually introducing pistachio
here, and it will prove a very valuable crop, as the nut is useful in making
confectionery as well as for consumption like the almond.
The Sacramento Bee says that the garden is also in receipt of the Cara
tonia silujua, an edible tree bean. The tree is evergreen, with beautiful foli
age, and grows to a height of forty feet. The crop of beans is large, and the
P">e*ns are not only food for man, but are valuable for stock, eaten pod and
11. Another variety, the Longissimo siliqua, furnishes the St. John's bread,
the bean and pod being sugary. A shipment has also been made of the
Afceria caflfra, said to be the most valuable hedge plant known. It comes
from the Cape of Good Hope, and besides being a fine hedge plant and wind
break bears an edible fruit resembling the crab apple, which is extensively
â¢used" for jam, marmalade, jelly and sauce. Many other plants are already re
ceived at the garden, where a fumigating plant is being put in to guard
against the introduction of plant diseases and noxious insects.
In a little time the plant garden will attract visitors from all over. the
countrj', for it may easily become the most interesting station of the kind
rh the world.

JOHNSTOWN FLOODâ J. L. C.
Lake Tahoe, Cal. The town of Johns
town. Pa., was destroyed by a flood
caused by the breaking of a dam on
South Fork Creek May 31, 1SS3.
It was not necessary for a doctor to
substantiate her testimony. Sidders
said Miss Anderson did the hugging.
She, hugged him so hard, he says, that
she broke her arm and rib.
The champion lover has been discov
ered in Chicago. He is Henry Sidders,
and in a Justice's Court he acknowl
edged the ardent nature of his wooing
and paid $3 So court costs. He was
charged by Emma Anderson of 19 Daw
son street with having hugged her so
tight that he broke her arm and frac
tured one of her ribs. He was also
charged with kissing Maggie Elton so
fervently that part of her cheek came,
away with his teeth.
"I never felt anything like it," said
Miss Anderson. "First he put one arm
around me, and I felt. a sharp pain in
my right arm. Then he put both arms
around me and put on full steam, and
I felt one of my ribs crack."
Dr. E. H. Wherritt testified that what
she said was correct.
"Why," said Emma, "he is worse
than a bear for hugging."
Then came Miss Elton, who said that
Sidders had a way of showing his af
fection which was not all his own. "I
permitted him to kiss my cheek," she
said, "but he took such a bite I thought
he would devour me. I was never kissed
that way before. He bit a large piece
out of my face."

true they are for sure n nd any woman
can bear testimony that the effect of
good clothes is more than an outward
and visible one â it is far more, it is an
inward spirituality bolstering up of
one."
"I have known a new gown to make
the most disconsolate Mrs. Gummidge
cheer up and take an interest in life; I
have known a new hat to get an al
most hopeless invalid out of bed and
on her feet when her family had long
since given up all hone of her recovery.
The effect of good clothes on the self
respect cannot be overestimated.
"Perhaps some psychologist will arise
some day to tell us why these things
are true. I can't explain them, but
"If you want to know the best rem
edy for the blues," said a thoughtful
girl to a companion, "I'll tell you. It
isn't to take a walk, nor to read aloud
to an invalid, nor to take a course of
Mark Twain, nor to buy a pound of
chocolates and eat them all yourself â
it Is something even simpler than these
remedies. I learned about it from a
person who said that, while she had
often been threatened with the blues,
she had really never had an attack of
them because she always used the cure
before melancholy had pot a hold on
her," says the Philadelphia Times.
"Well, not to keep you in suspense
any longer, the way to cure the blues
if you have them and to stave them
off if you feel them coming un is to
put on all your best clothes and wear
them until the spasm passes off. The
girl who told me about this said that
no sooner did she perceive that she was
beginning to think what an unsatisfac
tory world this was and no sooner did
she fee! that all was vanity than up to
her room she rushed in a hurry.
"Once there, she would arrange her
hair as elaborately as possible and put
on the best petticoatsâ if silk, so much
the better â the best gown, collar, hat
and veil that she possessed. A pair of
fresh white gloves, she said, she found
a great efficacy in raising the spirits.
Then she would Â«ro out to walk and as
she walked the beneficent effect of her
good clothes would make itself felt and,
though she was in the depths when she
started, by the time she turned back
she was feeling that all was not as
black as it was painted and when she
arrived at her own door she was as

Edna May, -who has arrived in the
United States bv this time, will proba
bly have made it known that A. E. W.
Mason, author of "The Four Feathers,"
has written a plav for her use. This,
of course, is Mason's second bid for
fortune as a dramatist, the first being
his adaptation of his own story "Miran
da of the Balcony" for Mrs. Fiske. An
other popular novelist who is giving
us a play for the first time is. however,
Mrs. Elinor Glyn. who wrote "The Vis
its of Elizabeth." Her play, a comedy,
has been accepted bv a London man
ager, but it is too early yet to say
anything definite regarding it. Arthur
Morrison, author of "A Child of the
Jago," has been urged many times to
try his hand at writing for the stoge,
always hitherto without success. Now,
however, assisted by Herbert Sargent,
Morrison has made one of his "Tales
of Mean Streets" into a plav which is
called "That Brute Simmons." Cyril
Maude will appear in It later in the
season.
Once more Gabriele d'Annunzio is in
a temper. He lost patience several
months, ago, it may be remembered,
over the way in which disaster seemed
to dog his footsteps in connection with
the production of his play, "The
Daughter of Jorio." Then, hovyever, he
had good reason .for vexation, for it
really looked as if fate had decided that
his drama never should see the li^ht.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL.
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, Aug. 16.â During
the coming season several English
story writers of note are going to try
their luck with plays, sn spite of the
ill fortune that has attended most ex
periments of this kind up to date. One
of the latest victims of the rule to
which J. M. Barrie is so brilliant an
exception was Max Pemberton, whose
maiden plav, "The Finishing School."
had a speedy finish. Most people will
wish H. G. Wells better luck. For the
first time the author of "The Time Ma
chine" has written a play v.hich James
Welch has accepted and which will be
tried early in November. All parties
are secretive as to the exact theme of
this work, but \l can be said that there
aren't arij- Martians, invisible men. or
giants in it. The play Is, in fact, in
Mr. Wells' other mannerâ that which in
spired those two charming romances,
"Love and Mr. Lewisham" and "The
Wheels of Chance." Something has
been said already about the play by
W. W. Jacobs, author of "The Skip
per's Wooing." which Cyril Maude will
produce at the New Theater. Its title
is "Beauty and the Barge," the beauty
being Jessie Baten.an, who was so
much admired at home when she ap
peared with Charles Hawtrey in "A
Message From Mars."
PLAY FOR EDXA MAY.
Beerbohm Tree is to reopen Hi3
Majesty's with one of his elaborate
Shakespearean revivals, "The Tem
pest" this time: but playgoers are more
Interested in the new piece by Stephen
Phillips, which is to follow it. Phil
lips Is a slow and conscientious worker
and nothing whatever has come from
him since the production of "UIysse3"
over two years aso. It was known
that he had a new play under way.
and now it seems that Nero la the
hero of it, "even a3 Herod was the cen
tral figure of one of Phillip's other po
etic dramas. The theme is full of pos
sibilities, few of which are likely to
have been missed by the author of
"Paolo and Francesca."
Henry** Hubert Da vies, author of
"Cousin Kate," probably has got tired
of being referred to as the youngest
of playwrights and will be glad to sur
render the title. He will have to, any
how, for here is Reginald Kennedy-
Cox, who, at twenty-two, has a brace
of plays accepted for early production
in London. Until recently this youne
man was an undergraduate In Oxford
University. Ever since he was a lad.
however, he has been stage-struck and
has spent every vacation playing small
parts in provincial touring companies.
Thus he got a knowledge of stage tech
nique. One of his plays la *o be pro
duced at the Royalty, Mrs. Patrick
Campbell's London theater, at the end
of the present month. It Is called
â¢The Chetwynd Affair." and will be
under the direction of Gilbert Hare.
Kennedy-Cox's other effort, a four-act
comtdy. has been accepted by Miss
Beryl Faber and will be seen In the
provinces shortly, and brought to Lon
don later on.
YOUNGEST OP PLAYWRIGHTS.
Duse deserted at the last moment,
quarrels arose between the other mem
bers of the cast, the leading man sud
denly was taken sick, accidents befe!:
two of the artists engaged in painting
thf- scenery, and other misfortunes fol
lowed. However, the piece was given
at last, made a hit, and has been run
ning ever since.
Not Ions ago it struck Scarpetta, the
Neopolitan comic actor, that there
would be money in a travesty on th?
D'Annunzio play and accordingly hÂ«
set to work on one which he meant to
call "The Son of Jorio." Of course as
soon as he heard of it D'Annunzio was
up in arms and he denounced Scarpetta
in a letter to the newspapers. The
comedian repiied by demanding to
know if D'Annunzio had copyrighted
the entire Jorio family, and a lively
correspondence has followed. In which
it must be confessed the distinguished
playwright has had rather the worst
of it. Now he threatens legal proceed
ings to prevent Scarpetta from produc
ing his travesty.
To an American the whole suggestion is revolting' Here the people
have rights that individual rulers did not give, cannot enlarge and are
powerless to take away. We are not looking beyond ourselves for acts of
grace and mercy. The birth of a son in any of our homes is the
coming of a man to be a sovereign among sovereigns, the equal of millions
of rulers of an empire greater than the Czar's. The birth of an American
bo^' is of more significance to the world than the coming of a dozen sons to
the Czar. The American boy is in bi> cradle a potential defender of the
inalienable rights of man. The Czar's son. clad in purple and given titles
with his nursing bottle, is a potential oppressor of human beings and a
born* defender of the tyranny of the few over the manv.
a LL the world has been informed of the exceeding grace and mercy of
/\ the Czar shown to his subjects on the occasion of the baptism of his
<**â¢ son, the future autocrat of all the Russias. By imperial ukase, and of
his own will, as the sole source of human rights in his empire, he abolished
the use of the knout, remitted certain fines and relieved some provinces of
the punishment of the innocent for evasions of military duty for which they
were not responsible.
The Russian press has hailed these acts of grace with a chorus of
ascription to the tyrant of the empire. The rest of the world, and especially
the people of the nations who are free, have received a fine object lesson in
the difference between autocracy and freedom. Especially in this country
and in England the people have been long accustomed to enjoyment of the
rights of man. entrenched in the law of the land and beyond the meddling
reach of any ruler.
This came about by recognition of the existence of certain inalienable
rights in man, natural rights, which neither, those who enjoy them nor those
who wou3d take them away can alienate, limit, or destroy. The history of
civilization is the history of this development of the law as a system to
protect natural rights and leave man secure in their employment. It is a
system that grew from the people outwardly and upwardly and did not
descend upon them as the gift of a man like themselves. But for a thousand
years, from Rurik to Nicholas, the people of Russia have had none of the
rights of humanity, except as a gift from the Czar. Their homes are not
inv:o!<To!e, their propertjf is not their own, their personal rights are limited,
snd they have lived froni age to age subordinated, dependent and. oppressed,
sometimes receiving from one Czar privileges which another Czar has taken
away.
The Czar considers himself not bound by solemn treaties entered into
by "bis predecessors to secure the allegiance of peoples brought under the
rule of the empire. In the Grand Duchy of Finland the Finns were the
beneficiaries of a treaty that left them in possession of ancient rights and
that secured the franchise of humanity. They had their schools and universi
ties, their free press and security of person and property. They had a judi
cial system and the courts protected them in the rights of man. But the
Czar who has handed out a Jean and meager dish of mercy to his subjects
revoked and violated that treat}', destroyed the last vestige of Finnish free
dom and put the Grand Duchy under the hard heel of the Cossack. If he
h.2d desired to do things merciful he should have begun by dispensing jus
tice and restoring the ancient rights of Finland guaranteed by his ancestors.
J?ut meager as the gift of the Czar is, it is not based upon any merit
or right of his people. If the few thing's given them were theirs of right
they should have had them long ago. If they have the right not to be
flogged with the knout for trivial offenses, that degradation should never
have been put upon them. If all the restrictions removed were wrong
they were always wrong and never should have been imposed.
They are removed now because a son has been born to the Czar! He
had already three daughters, and at their birth and baptism had remained
callous to the sufferings and obdurate to the needs of the Russian people.
Xow the pln-siological accident of sex in a child has moved him to
dole put these slender and insufficient mercies. An event in his family
that is of constant occurrence in the families of his empire is made the
occasion of doing that which should not have been necessary or possible
if his people were regarded as anything but his personal chattels and the
footstool of his power. It the child had been a girl the world would not
have been notified of his exceeding grace made affluent by a purely domestic
event in his household. The knout would still have been cutting the soft
f'e-h and drawing the blood of his subjects, and whole provinces would be#
given over to the Cossack whips in punishment for individual evasions ot
militarv dutv.

They object to the plan because it
gave many teachers the minimum
salary of $60, although they had seen
little or no service, whereas the old
teachers with several years' experience
are receiving but $62 50 or $65 and are
being raised by gradual stages before
finally reaching the maximum salaries
paid to teachers.
The School Directors considered all
these points when the schedule was
adopted and in adopting a minimum
of $60 increased the expenditures by
55000 or $6000.
There is some dissatisfaction among
a fe,w teachers in the Public School

the new salary schedule. It is claimed
that the pedagogues whose salaries
were increased under the old schedule
would now be receiving more money if
it were still in effect.

Commissioner North declined to make
any comment upon the foregoing corre
spondence, but made a few quotations
from the records of his office. These
show that since January 1. 1900. only
thirty-two students have applied for
admission. Of this number thirty were
admitted. One was denied. He was a
graduate of Yale University and came
from the Dutch colony of Batavia
without any papers whatever. The oth
er had a contagious disease and was
rejected by the quarantine branch of
the service. The last batch of students
arrived on the steamship Siberia on
August 18 and were landed within two
hours from the time the vessel arrived
at the dock. During the fiscal year
ended June 30. 1904, the greatest per
centage of rejections was of applicants
claiming to be natives of the United
States. There were 294 applicants, and
221 of these were denied a landing.
A letter from Frank P. Sargent, Com
missioner General of Immigration, com
menting upon the letter quoted, Is as
follows:
My I>ear Mr. Stratton: By reference the
bureau is in receipt of your note of the 15th
in^tar.t inclosir.it letter from John Goodnow,
Vnited States Consul General at Shanghai.
China, in which the suggestion \ s made that
the cases of Chinese persons applying for ad
mission to the United States as members of
the exempt classes be Investigated In China
prior to embarkation of the applicants.
That this is the proper method there Is but
little doubt and the writer has recommended
to the Secretary of Commerce, and Labor that
such a plan be inaugurated. To have the mat
ter conducted upon proper lines, however. It
is probable that letislatlon must first be se
cured to authorize the practice In addition
to the present requirements. Sir. Goodnow'a
letter Is herewith returned. Respectfully.

Stratton: I thank y u very much for your
courtesy to H. E. Â£hÂ«ns Nang-hoo and the
portrait ol the Empre ? s Dowager. The Chinese
her* are hishly pleased. The word Is very
industriously put al>> ut here that the rich

eye cf the needle t! an any Chinese has In
getting through the San Francisco Custom
house, and the old n an Shens: was scared to
death with the idea of what mlpht happen to
him in San Francisc! I told him that every
courtesy and conM<3< ration would be shown
him, but nothing we Jld do but that I must
bother you with a pfr^onal letter.
The other nationalr. ies are still taking ad
vantage of this scare and are diverting many
youn? men who would otherwise no to the
United States as bona fide students into golnÂ»s
to Krance. England and Belgium. It does
seem to me that ?oeÂ» method of examination
by the immigration bureau could be devised
so that the examination could take place on
this side and the exempted classes walk off
H:e ship at San Francisco as easily as any
other nationality. It would only need ex
aminers -at Hongknr*. Shanghai and Yoko
hama. They could fi - d out the bonas fides of
an immigrant much better here than in San
Francisco. The Con-ul'B vise could sttll be
Kiven independently. If we are to educate thÂ»
young men who are now going abroad and
thus keep our grip n China we must devise
seme such way to 1ft the students In. Very
truly. JOHN GOODNOW.
The following letters to Customs Col
lector Stratton show the latest stage
of sentiment on the Chinese exclusion
act:
Information was conveyed yesterday
to United States Immigrant Commis
sioner Hart H. North that Frank P.
Sargent, United States Commissioner
General of Immigration, recommended
that all examinations of Chinese repre
senting themselves as members of the
exempt classes be investigated in China
prior to embarkation of the applicants.
These tidings threw the Chinese Bu
reau into a state bordering upon con
sternation. North said that the records
of the bureau showed that more than 75
per cent of Chinese claiming to be mer-r
chants and holding "section six" certi
ficates had been denied a landing be
cause it -had been ascertained that they
were coolies. Callous spots as large as
the palm of a man's hand had been
found on the shoulders of the fraudu
lent applicants; their hands were large,
hard and horny; their arms sunburned
to the elbows, their legs sunburned to
the knees and many of them had ulcers
on the legs caused by working in the
wet paddy fields. Vet all of these certi
ficates had been made out in proper
form and had been vised by the Ameri
can Consul at Canton, China.
GOODXOW'S IDEAS.
Attorney Johnson made further pro
test against the motion to set the case
until such time as the deposition of
Miss Warren shall have been taken,
but Judge Coffey saw no reason for
such action and set October 4 as the
day for the trial. The court, how
ever, ordered that Miss Warren give
her deposition next. Tuesday afternoon.
ThÂ« principal be-neSclary under this will. In

In answer to these caustic flings. At

If th<?y are not thfy *bou!d have no objec
tion to our effort to take this der-osition and
to take it before the cast is set for trial, fir

An affidavit heretofore filed setting
forth that Mips Warren was ill and
unable to respond to the demands of
the contestant was assumed by Albert
Johnson, who argued the case of his
firm, to be an evasioti of the process
of the court. After presenting the
leeal phases bearing upon his richt to
take the deposition of Miss Warren, he
said:
A clash of counsel yesterday after
noon during the hearing of preliminary
questions in the Dolbeer will case be
fore Jijdge Coffey presages a bitter
contest. It was all directed on the one
hard to prepare, on the other to pre
vent, if possible, an ordeal for Etta M.
Warren, principal beneficiary under the
will of the late Bertha M. Dolbeer. At
the end Miss Warren's defenders were
defeated and next Tuesday afternoon
at 2 o>lock at the offices of Johnson &
Johnson :n the Mills building, she must
give her deposition in the interest of
Adolph Schander, uncle of the late
Miss Dolbeer. who claims that she ex
ecuted the testament that is the ob
ject of his attack when she was men
tally irresponsible.
The hearing uf yesterday was upon
the petition of Attorneys Johnson &
Johnson for an order of court directing
Miss Warren to appear and give her
deposition as a witness for the con
testant and upon a motion of Attor
neys E. S. Pillsbury and W. F. Wil
liamson to set the contest fur trial.
JOHNSON MAKKS CHARGES.
Dr. John Thompson commended Dr.
j Ferrier's address and referring to ser-
I mons he had heard said that some of
Â¦ them should be relegated to the waste
Â¦ paper basket before . they reach the
i pulpit. In connection with what had
been said anent the tirade on the part
; of "some of the press" against mis
â¢ sionary effort he declared that such
i a course was quite uncalled for. The
! doctor said that the missionary goes
| first where the newspaper man did not
venture, and after the missionary had
made the opening the newspaper man
! stole in.
i Dr. Francis M. Larkin defended the
! press. He considered that the press of
I San Francisco had been generous in
its publication of the news of mission
ary works even to the extent of devot
; ing as much as a column and a half
to interviews with returned foreign
, missionaries.
Dr. Ferrier explained that he had
i great regard for the press and that in
his comments he had reference to edi
torials found in "some of the coast
papers."
Dr. H. H. Bell. United Presbyterian
; Church; Rev. J. A. Hollars. Bethlehem
' Congregational Church, and Dr. "Wal
i ter M. White. West Side Christian
I Church, were appointed a committee
to co-operate with other committees al
ready formed, in an effort to suppress
the distribution of obscene literature
I in the city.
If for no other purpose our religious papers
are needed Sn order that they may combat
this pernicious teaching of not a few of the
dally papers.
Three times during the last year has The
Pacific found it necessary to make reply to
editorials In Pacific Coast dailies attacking
mis?ions.
Such an Idea, if put In practice In the early
hi'tory of the church, would have left the
world stranded In barbarism.
The daily paptr hag its place and should
have It. but it fills too large a p'.ace in thÂ«
lives of many persons.
Now it Is sometimes said in this newspaper
age that the daily paper meets all the needs
of the people â secular and religious alike.
This emanates aJmost invariably from the
editorial brain. The Indifference manifested
by some ctrurch people toward their church
papers furnishes some feundation for It.
As for the assertion of some cf the daily
papers that there Is no need for the religious
weekly it may be said that that is based on
the same narrow and unenlightened survey as
is the frequent statement from the same source
that foreign missionary effort has been so far
a failure aa to Justify no longer its continu
ance.
"The newspaper, the magazine, the
review and the low priced book are
forming the thought and shaping the
action of the present and the future."
said Dr. W. W. Ferrier at a union
meeting of ministers held in the Y. M.
C. A. auditorium yesterday. Dr. Fer
rier said in part:
This Is preeminently a reading age. But
this is not to say that people in general are
reading the best literature and getting the
best results from the reading practice.
Metzinscr Must Stay in Jail.
The Supreme court aeennea yester
day to grant a petition for a writ of
habeas corpus in favor of Andrew
Metzinger. The defendant was sen
tenced to Eix months' imprisonment in
the County Jail on each of two charges
of petty larceny in October of last year.
He escaped on January 22 of this year,
but was recaptured five days later. He
holds that he Is entitled to credits, but
Sheriff Curtis differs. As the Supreme
Court also differs with Metzinger he
wi!l probably remain behind the bars
until his sentence Ehall have expired.
private under cross-examination ad
mitted that he had kept his mouth shut
and that his testimony was "insti
gated" by Captain Evans.
The effort of Judge Cotton to shut
out this admission called Dorsey to his
feet with the statement that he expect
ed to show that "Captain Evans was
the one instigator: that he had fur
nished the testimony; that he had been
vigilant, indefatigable and savage as
an enemy of Mrs. Madden; that he had
shown her attentions, which had been
rejected, and that in his revenge he
would bring any charge to destroy
her."
Snell oroceeded to tell that he "had
no use for Captain Evans, because he
Is no good for the company," and when
both sides had announced that they
were finished with the witness Judge
Hebbard peremptorily ordered that the
plaintiff's case should be. rested. Dor
sey said that he had no testimony to
offer in the absence of his client, and
the Judge made the order for a decree
as stated above.
Two important depositions were opened
by the Judge after the trial of the case.
One was that of Captain Madden re
citing matters dating from the time of
their marriage in Georgia, in April, 1S98,
and his army orders, which made him
depart on the bridal night, to the time
of his return from service in the isl
ands/ In this he denies specifically
charges of improper association with
other women. The other deposition is
i that of the army nurse, Marjorie Kirk
patrick, who relates in detail a story
unfit for publication regarding a. visit
of Mrs. Madden to Robichon, who was
ill at the Presidio hospital.
The average wage of a male school
teacher in the United States is about
5450 per year. The average salary of
a woman teacher in the United States
is about $S50 per year.
The features of the case ivere, first, j
Judge Hebbard's speedy decision with
out the recital of unnecessary details; !
and. second, the court's positive rul
ing that Mrs. Madden's attorney should
not degrade or humiliate a'witness by
a series of Questions reflecting upon :
her personal conduct.
It was learned after the hearing that j
the witnesses subpenaed but not ex- j
amined were Marjnrie Kirkpatrick, an
army nurse; Mrs. Constance Dean, nee I
Lawrence; Captain Burgess. U. S. A.;
Fred Haussler, photographer; Paul
Phillips, a transport employe; Kittie
Girard. Mrs. Jerome Madden, wife of ;
the plaintiff's father, and Eleanor Kop- ,
Htz. Charles Mackenzie was summon
ed as a witness, but he is now abroad ;
in his service on a transport.
The first witness called was Mrs. j
Carrie Shipler, formerly Carrie Bechel. ,

DOt remember, she was summoned at ;
midnight to bring refreshment from |
the kitchen to Mrs. Madden's room, and j
she found Lieutenant Robichon there.
The details of the things Ehe observed
had an important bearing upon the
case* The witness answered sharply
and directly every question propounded
but hesitated when, on cross-examina
tion, Dorsey asked her if she had not
been discharged by Mrs. Madden be
cause of her improper conduct with
soldiers at the barracks.
Dorsey's first question related to the :
witness' visits to the Palace Hotel in I
Benicia. The line of questioning j
; which followed caused Judge Hebbard Â»
to interrupt and say: "We are trying |
| one woman here, and that is enough. !
Â¦ You may impeach her credibility as a .
, witness, but do not go into her per- j
sonal affairs. I have never allowed this
Â¦ line of questioning in this court, and I i
never will." Then, turning to the wit- 'Â¦,
ness. Judge Hebbard said: "I instruct!
Â¦ you not to answer any question tend
ing to degrade or humiliate you." On a
line of questioning regarding-her inter-
I views with Captain Madden's attorneys i
and the pay she was to receive, Mrs. i
I Shipler said that she had been prom
ised her "expenses" by Captain Mad
den.
PRI VATK'S OBSERVATIONS.
The other witness was Henry Snell. j
! a private and musician, now stationed â¢
! at" Angel Island. On Captain Evans' j
1 recommendation he became striker for {
i Mrs. Madden, and also took care of >
' Robichon's quarters at Benicia Bar- i
â¢ racks. He told the court of an unusual !
; circumstance, strongly relating to the !
i charge against Mrs. Madden, which i
' was witnessed in Robichon's room. The !
It was on the card that soldiers and !
civilians would be involved in scandal
in the trial of the suit for divorce
brought by Captain John F. Madden,
U. S. All against his wife, Edith. Judge
Hebbard, on motion of the accused
wife's attorney, J. W. Dorsey, ordered
that none should hear the testimony
except the attorneys and the news
paper men present at yesterday's hear
ing.
The evidence of two witnesses for the
plaintiff was enough to warrant the
court ordering that the captains at
torneys should rest their case, and the
other. side, being unable to present any
evidence, was ruled out of court.
Thereupon Judge Hebbard ordered
the entering of an interlocutory decree
of divorce in favor of Captain Madden,
gave the custody of their son, John
Madden Jr., to his paternal grand
parents and granted the mother the
privilege of visiting her boy twice each
month.
When the case was called for trial
at 10 o'clock Attorney Dorsey asked
the court for a continuance on the
ground that his client, Mrs. Madden,
was not present. Judge Cotton, attor
ney for Madden, declared that Mrs*.
Madden had visited her child a day
or two ago and at that time she was
living at the Laughlm Hotel and
should be easy to find. Judge Hebbard
ordered that the trial should proceed.
At that moment Captain Madden was
in court with his brother. Augustavus
Madden, a paymaster in the United
States navy, and nearly all of the
captain's witnesses were on hand.
These witnesses and others, not includ
ing the members of the bar and the
newspaper men, were ordered out of
the room and there was no record to
show what witnesses had been sub
penaed in the plaintiff's behalf nor
would any of his attorneys volunteer
an identification of those who appeared
in court and were deprived of an op
portunity to testify. One of Captain
Madden's counsel declared that the two
witnesses examined had not told all
1 of the story which the plaintiff expect
i ed to prove.

It Is claimed that the national con
vention had no authority to pass upon
the regularity of the State convention

of the credentials committee of the na

itself must be considered null and vuid
so far as the party within the State is
concerned.
MADISON. Aug. 29.â The attorneys
for Secretary of State Walter L.
Houster filed his answer -with the clerk
of the Supreme Court thi3 evening in
the suit brought against him on August
9 by the nominees of the anti-Third-
Term Republican State ticket, headed
by Samuel A. Cook, to cornel him to
place their names in the Republican
column on the offclal ballot and to re
strain him from placing the names of
the La Follette nominees In that
column.
The answer, which is a voluminous
document, denies all the allegations
upon which the suit rests. The answer
claims that of the 1065 delegates to the
State convention Â£15 1-5 La Follette
delegates were uncontested. The con
tests were reviewed and the number of
delegates in favor of the Governor was
535 1-3.

The case in point was that of Coun

State Senate E. J. Randall of Con
cord, Contra Costa County. The dele
gates from Marin and Contra Costa
Hi-sembled at the headquarters of the
Democratic State Central Committee.
The latter county, having the ma
jority, named the nominee. Randall
is president ef the Anderson Lumber
Company of Martinez. He is a man
40 years of age and possessed of good
business traits. His nomination will
preserve the Democratic organization
in the district, but the opinion is gen
eral that Charles M. Belshaw. the Re
publican nominee, will be returned to
the upper house of the Legislature by
an increased majority. Four yeara
ago many of the attaches of
San Quentin prison worked night
and day to bring about the de
feat of Belshaw and- the election of
J. H. Wilkins, the Democratic can
didate. In the coming campaign har
mony prevails in the Republican camp
and all the signs indicate that Belshaw
will get thje full Republican vote of
th* 1 - district.

HAWTHORNE. Nov., AuÂ£. 29.-At
Laughton Canyon, fifty miles south of
here, where the washout of last Tues
day tore out five miles of track and
roadbed and where fifty men have since
been employed in repairing, was washed
out again yesterday and now is in much
worse condition than at any time be
fore. There are indications of more
rain to-day, so that the time of resum
ing through traffic remains very uncer
tain.
The Carson and Colorado will not
have through trains in less than a week
even if no more washouts occur, and
the indications on the Tonopah road
are yet more discouraging.
Forty delayed passengers now at

BUTTE, Mont., Aug. 29.â A cloud
burst in Silver Bow Canyon has
wrought havoc with the Northern Pa
cific tracks two miles east of Durant
and wrecking crews are now at work
clearing away a mass of rock that was
precipitated upon the tracks.
The storm broke last night and what
was a few hours before a dry canyon
was soon changed into a running tor
rent which tore away rocks and hurled
them upon the track. The roadbed was
also washed out and traffic was de
layed several hours. It is estimated
that about twenty-five tons of rork
were piled upon the Northern Pacific
tracks and a new gorge was formed by
the force of the water. Two bridges
were swept away. It will require
twenty-four hours to repair the dam
age.

Quotations for Esgs are still improving, the

higher yesterday. There were a few ?r.les of
fine ranch over the top quotation, but they
were not of a sufficiently pronounced char

poifitinK upward very stroniely, however.
Receipts were S1.4C0 lbs Cutter, 000 cases

Butter was firm yesterday, -with the finer
erades in lisht sunuly and well cleaned up.
Prices were no hisher. but dealers eot full
figures for everything and were disposed to
force quotations ud as far as they could. The
tendency is toward still better prices.
The Cheese market is still overstocked and

Superior Judge Hunt yesterday
granted ten days' time in which James
W. Coffroth may answer the suit of
Thomas Garrett for $50,000 damages.
Garrett. publisher of the Evening Post,
brought suit for an injunction and was
granted a temporary restraining order
by Judge Kerrigan preventing the firsr
iss-ue of the Stinger, in which Coffroth
made. a personal attack upon the pub
lisher. The restraining order failed of
its purpose because the papers were
distributed before the order of court
had been served upon the defendant.
But attached to the suit for an injunc
tion was a plea that Garrett had been
damaged in the sum of $50,000. The
latter portion of the complaint is the
one ,Coffroth Is expected to answer.

It -was announced yesterday that
Colonel Francis E. Beck, local man
ager of the International Banking
Corporation, v.ill retire in a few days.
His withdrawal from the bank has
been a matter of negotiation between
the New York management and him
self for several months, but, as was
announced some time ago in The Call,
the two parties could not agree upon
a settlement, Beck having demanded
his salary for the full period of his
contract of two years.
Although all parties interested in
the negotiations decline to enter into
a discussion of the amount paid Man
ager Beck in consideration of his res
ignation, it is understood, that he is
to receive 'a very large portion of the
sum demanded.
His successor will be named in a
few days. A report that the Portland
manager of the banking concern
Avould be called here was authorita

The Alcazar company of players was
seen to advantage last night in a splen
did production of "Nathan Hale," with
White- Whittlesey in the title role. The
play is founded on historical events
during the War of the Revolution, when
Hale sacrificed his life to aid his coun
try in throwing off the British yoke.
The situations are very strong and
the scenic effects, notably the orchard
scene where Hale is hanged, are fine
specimens of the painter's art. Whittle
sey gave a capital impersonation of the
young American officer and was given
most effective support by Eugenie
Thais Lawton, whose improvement as*
an emotional actress goes steadily on.
Their scene previous to when the hero
goes to his death, during which neither
speaks one word, was well enacted.
Harry D. Byers showed true dramatic
ability as Cunningham and his good
work won recognition from the audi
ence. Luke Conness as Fitzroy never
acted better and George Osbourne,
Harry Hilliard. John B. Maher, Marie
Howe. Virginia Brissac and Annie
Mifflin all contributed their share to a
most artistic production. The school
scene furnished most of the comedy
element. There is much in the play to
arouse the patriotism of the spectators.
The piece must certainly be added to
the list of pronounced successes at this
playhouse.
PARK BOARD HAS CONTROL
OVER THE OCEAN BEACH
The Board of Public Works yester
day received a communication from
F. M. Yorke & Co., the firm that has
the contract to repair bituminous
streets, that it will decline to repave
the pavement in front of the Phelan
building on Market street at the con
tract price of ten cents per square foot.
The contractors claim that they bid
at the figure named, according to the
specifications which require the resur
facing only of bituminous pavements
in need of repair. The cost of repair
ing the Pheian block pavement would
be at least twenty-five cents per square
foot, as it would, necessitate the tear
ing out of the wooden blocks and refill
ing the space with six inces of con
crete.
The Board of Works itself thinks
that it would be an injustice to the
contractors to compel them to repair
the pavement for the contract price.
As the Supervisors' Finance Committee
desired to hear from the contractors
the Board of Works asked them if they
would not repair the block, it being
the desire of the board to have it in
good condition for the Knights Templar
Conclave.
Commissioner of Works Mastrettl
asked the Supervisors to appropriate
some $1900 out of the urgent necessity
fund and hinted that he would barri
cade the block if it were not repaired,
as a monument to municipal parsi
mony. ,

Army headquarters in the Phelan
building have once more resumed their
usual routine of work. General Mac-

Army circles, especially the trans
port service, are much amused at a re
cent publication in one of our dailiÂ«Â»3.
which has made an attack on the sys
tem of procedure adopted by
the transport service, particularly
in reference to the smuggling
scandal on the transport Solace.
In the article referred to it was sug
gested that the Solace should be trans
ferred from the army service to thÂ«
control of the navy, whose officers (so

In Judge Cook's court nine jurors
were procured to try the case of George
T. Querbach, charged with the murder
of Mrs. Annie Wilson, a widow, at 5-
Capp street on November 1.' The other ,
three jurors will be secured this morn- j
ing. Querbach had been rooming at
Mrs. Wilson's residence and had prom
ised to marry her. He presented her
with a wedding dress and bonnet. They
quarreled, and on the day in question
Querbach called at her house and de
manded the return of the presents he
had given her. She refused, and during |
a struggle between them she expired.
Querbach tore up the dress and bonnet. [
Mrs. Wilson was a big, stout .woman
and was suffering from fatty degenera- :
tion of the heart. The autopsy showed
that her death was due to that disease
superinduced by the shock of her strug
gle with Querbach.
In Judge Dunne's court the case of
Fred Tobelmann, charged with the
murder of his wife, Mary, at the resi â¢ i
dence of her brother-in-law, Ernest
Hurrub, 6OSV2 Minna street, on April If]
was set for trial yesterday. Tobel
mann's attorney interposed a challenge '
to the panel, which the Judge sus
tained and ordered 150 names to be
drawn by the County Clerk. The trial .
was continued till this afternoon. To- :
belmann's wife had left him, and be- :
cause she refused to return to him un- |
less he promised to support her and 1
their children he shot and killed her. !
It was a singular coincidence ths^t
the cases of four men charged with
murder were on the calendars of the
Superior Court at the Hall of Justice
for trial yesterday. Of the four, three
are accused of killing women, and two
of the murders happened on the same
day, the victims being wives who were
living apart from their husbands.
In Judge Lawlor's court the trial of
Alexander B. Garnett, charged with the
murder of Major J. W. McClung on
November 25, was continued before a
jury. The case for the prosecution was
closed when court adjourned till this
morning. The objections made by At
tGrney Collins to the introduction of the
testimony of Mrs. Elizabeth Hitchcock-
Coit and Dr. George F. Shiels taken at
the prelimnary hearing before Police
Judge Fritz on Becember 7 were over
ruled. The testimony of both witnesses
was read to the jury. Dr. Shiels attend
ed Major McClung after he was shot.
Mrs. Coit save in her testimony a full
narrative of the incidents that led up
to the shooting and Garnett's threat
to shoot her.
The case of Thomas P. Fallon,
charged with the murder of his wife,
Agnes, at 949 Mission street on April 1,
was set for trial in Judge Lawlor's
court yesterday, but was continued till
September 12. She had been living with
John Flemming for some .time and Fal
lon shot her.
The- complaint first alleges that the
company was incorporated with a cap
ital stock of $1,250,000, divided into $1
shares. Balliet was elected treasurer
on March 7, 1900, and on the same day
assumed the position of general man
ager, both offices lasting until March
21, 1904, when he resigned. While act
ing in those capacities, it is alleged,
Balliet sold shares and received sums
therefor aggregating $283,013 D8.
The first charge of his failure to ac
count relates to his receipt of two cam
eras worth $200 and two ore specimens
bought from a Mrs. Jones in Tuolumne
County. The company's demands for
these chattels have been refused, it is
said. Then the complaint goes on to
charge that entries were made in the
books showing disbursements aggre
gating 51S3.937 61, all of which were
made, it is alleged, without the author
ity or consent of the company, and not
in its Interest or benefit.
In the complaint numerous items of
the expenditures' are mentioned, includ
ing the following: $5530 90 refunded to
purchasers of shares from 1699 to May,
1903: $1155 house rent for Balliet's per
sonal use; $21,699 60 for attorneys' fees
and legal expenses in the case in the
United States District Court for the
Southern District of Iowa, in which
Balliet was charged and convicted of
using the United States mail with in
tent to defraud; $5500 deposited in the
First National Bank of Baker. City,
Or., in his own name; $1327 78 used in
promoting the Hudson Mutual Gold
Mining Company; $37,576 68 used for the
purchase of the Baker City Herald.
$10,000 (estimated) for his living ex
penses during the four years and $50.
000 for clerk and stenographer hire and
office expenses and other purposes not
named. R. M. F. Soto is attorney for
the company.
Once before the company â¢ sued Bal
liet on account of a large number of
shares which it was alleged he issued
to himself personally and as trustee for
Florence Balliet, his wife, but the new
action is of more importance to the
company and its stockholders, in that it
intimates a misuse of a major part of
the $283,013 9S alleged to have been re
ceived by Balliet while he was treas
urer and general manager of the com
pany.
Letson Balliet must make an ac
counting to the White Swan Mining
Company for his alleged personal use
of the company's funds, and he Is
charged with having $183,037 61 on the
wrong side of the ledger. A few days
ago some of the company's stockhold
ers sued for an accounting froni Wood
ward, the secretary and Balliet's "right
hand man," who was said to be short
$60,000 in his accounts. When that suit
was filed it was charged that the com
pany and its directors would' not father
the action on account of Woodward's
control. Before the ink had dried cm
the complaint a fraud order was Issued
cutting Balliet's and the company's let
ters out of the mail.
Chief Wittman was notified of the
charges ypste rday morning and prompt
ly ordered Quarles suspended. Quarles
joined the force on January 6. 1900.
The Ftory of Policeman Quarles is
that while off duty on Sunday night he
went into Mrs. Hertig's saloon, at
<"J?-ary street and Central avenue. It is
alleged that he was in an intoxicated
condition; that he had a dog with him
and soon beg-an to display his author
ity. He abused customers who were at
The bar. it is charged, and Bartender
Kelleher avers that when he asked the
patrolman to behave himself he pulled
his revolver and placing the muzzle
against his (K*>Ileh*Â»r's) breast declared
with an oath that he would make him
a subject for the Coroner.
Kelleher soothed Quarles, who re
placed the revolver in his pocket. One
..of the customers spoke to Quarles' dog.
and this again roused the policeman's
anger. "How dare you speak to my
jdojr?" it is claimed he shouted, as he
/pulled out his revolver. The man ad
dressed rushed nut of the saloon.
Quarles, it is alleged, continued to
shout and make a disturbance, and was
finally induced to leave the saloon.
The two stars that have been dimmed
arc those of Charles Cleaver and Wil
liam Quarles. The Chief says that the
conduct' of these men has been beyond
tolerance and that he does not want
such policemen in his department.
Cleaver is the policeman who is ac
cused of having fired four shots from
his revolver at an elk that was peace
fully browsing in the paddock at Gold
en Gate Park. This occurred Friday
morning last. Cleaver is said to have
been in an intoxicated condition, and
Â¦while riding in an automobile with two
women he essayed to show his clever
ness as a marksman by trying to bring
to earth the stately form of the mon
arch of the Canadian forests.
Both of- the accused men appeared
before the Auditor yesterday and de
manded their warrants and received
them. Later the orders were cashed by
the Treasurer. Several minutes after
ward, the Chief appeared at the. City
Hall and learned what had happened.
Then it was that he declared that there
Â¦will be no more police salaries paid un
til the first of the month, which means
that employes of the School Depart
ment will have to wait until the 2d or
3d of the month before getting their
money. On account of the rush that
overcomes the Auditor and Treasurer
on the 1st of the month it has been the
custom to pay the Police Department
off ahead of time, thus avoiding con
gestion when the hundreds of employes
of the School Department call for their
salaries. Chief Wittman says that this
shall never occur again.
â¢ School teachers and the Fire Depart
ment have usually presented their de
mands promptly on the 1st of the
month, but In the new order of busi
ness, they v.ill come after the Police
Department. Chief Wittman said that
it might be the desire of the Commis
sioners to discharge the accused po
liceman, and in that rase, or if a fine
\\?re imposed, it would have been or
dered that their salaries be withheld
pending investigation and final decision
of the board.
Chief Wittman has placed two po
licemen under the ban, and incidentally
become aware of the fact that the pay
ins off of the members of the force
teveral days prior to the first of the
month has led to complications. Here
after, the ru!e will be that no salaries
of j>olicemen shall be paid over the
counter of the city treasury until the
full thirty days' service, as prescribed
by law, have been fulfilled.
Let Herschel Mayall forget that he
has ever played Marc Antony and all
will be well with his Chan Wang. Last
night the Central put on "The First
Born," with Mayall in the leading role.
He has played it before, in Cincinnati.
And in Cincinnati Mayall's Chinaman
might be whylly forgiven him. Here,
within smell of Fish alley, it can't
quite.
If there is one thing more than an
other that a walk through Chinatown
impresses one with it is the philosophic
stolidity of the Oriental. Last night
while Mayall was "orating" I put in
some minutes watching the real Chi
nese supers â that with real Chinese
lanterns, real Chinese punk and real
Chinese turnips and carrots, spread at
mosphere in chunks. "Velly funny," I
think they would have said. They
looked it, in their mild Oriental way.
Really, it seemed as though the actor,
in his joy at getting hold of a part
worthy of him, were putting all the
"acting" he knew into it. That was it;
too much acting, too much gesture, too
much trouble, too many tears in his
voice. Yet, when Chan Wang carries
on the limp, little dead thkig that was
his son the samt vital thrill runs
through the house as first greeted the
scene in Powers' terse little drama.
Uptown, then, one simply advises May
all to .turn off steam â the Centralese
for repression. His second scene is ex
cellent.
The production is on the whole most
creditable and will well repay a visit.
The scene painter plays a star part, be
it not forgotten. A surprisingly good
performance is that of Ethel Clifton as
Looey Tsing â whose acquaintance with
Fish alley is only two weeks old.
She gets quite the Oriental color
into her work and in a day or two will
probably still more successfully con
ceal her Occidentalism. Krnest How
ell, in a very clever make-up, is ef
fective as the pipe mender, Henry Shu
mer is cleverly pompous as Dr. Pow
Len and Baby Martine is a dear little
Chinese butterfly as the first born,
Chan Toy. Walter Belasco's moment
as â¢ the ragpicker is a triumph. His
make-up is quite worth the price of ad
mission. The large house thought so.
It bouqueted him and applauded him
until he had to come on again and ask,
"Any more rags?"
"Turned Up." a lively farcical com
edy, precedes "The First Born."

Dr. H. J. Stewart's "Montezuma" will
open the programme with four num
bers, all orchestral. These will include
a "Morning Hymn." a "Valse Lente,"
a "Barbaric March" and a finale.
W. J. McCoy's "The Hamadryads,"
coming second on the programme, will
introduce the choral element, in which
his vu&k is said to be exceptionally
strong The chorus will be heard in a
processional march. "Hail to Apollo" â
Mr. Redding describes it as a "big up
lifting"âand again in accompaniment
to a solo by Judge Melvin. Mr. Mc-
Coy's other two numbers are orchestral.
Last on the programme is the "In
dian Jinks" of J. H. Redding, one of the
first of the music dramas written for
the Bohemians. It is written about an
Indian legend transcribed for "jinks"
purposes by Charles K. Field, and con
tains four numbers, an overture, "In
dian Legend"; a "Reverie," in which
the cor anglais plays a solo part;
"Storm" and "Prophecy," and a con
cluding choral, a' "Hymn of Fulfill
ment."
It will be explained, among other In
teresting things, by Sire Hotaling that
each work should flnd its composer in
happiest mood. Each work was com
posed con amore. without an eye either
to fame or shekels. Then Mr. Hotaling
will tell what they are all about. Not
like Walter Damroschâ he will get an
accomplice to pound wrong notesâ if
there are anyâ into the leit motifs on a
piano behind the scenes. He himself
will tell the stories in short synopses,
give a sketch of their musical treat
ment and illustrate their fashion of
production among the sacred redwoods.
The chances of admission . are not
great, however. At 10 o'clock -yester
day morning there were left lust 600
of the 2200 seats the Tivoli holds. There
are still a few tickets, however, and
the wise are hereby advised to early
investment. The fund thus obtained
is to be devoted by the Bohemians to
the preservation of the Guerneyille
grove and also to the further improve
ment of the "jinks."
As to Thursday's programme, Mr.
"Joe" Redding, who is in charge of the
orchestra, promises one that is "better
than any since the days of Herrold at
Platfs Hall." It will include sixty
men, the flower of the local flock. There
will also be a chorus of sixty voices,
composed exclusively of club members.
Judge Harry Melvln appears as the only
soloist, and Mr. "Dick" Hotaling will
play the part of an explanatory, Dam
rosch. The "music dramas" to be given
include parts of Dr. H. J. Stewart's
"Montezuma," the "Indian jinks" of
Mr. Redding and W. J. McCoy's "The
Hamadryads," each work conducted by
its composer.
The lirst public "jinks" of the Bohe
mian Club at the Tivoli on Thursday
afternoon promises to be" the kind, of
success that the good "jinkers" of the
club claim for the Guerneville yearly
festivals. What might be called, the
progressionist party, in the club is in
consequence delighted. For years the
"splendor, majesty, artistry, etc.," of
the "jinks" : festivals have had to be
taken entirely on trust by the unini
tiate. Guests of the club have hymned
their praise to the farthest corners of
the earth, but the local alien "knows
just as much about the festivals as the
war correspondents know about Port
Arthur.
But he is invited on Thursday af
ternoon. On Thursday afternoon the
Bohemian Club will attempt to make
good a part of its claim to considera
tion as the local center of light and
learning. For the first time there Will
be heard some of the "music dramas"
that are its particular pride, and every
body that can get a ticket is invited to
judge and enjoy. The grove, the fam
ous redwood grove, the majestic "suit
able surroundings of the original pro
ductions," will not be there, nor the
costumed chorus and soloists. But
everything else is on the programme.
