Japanese transports show that the Hitachi and the Sado
met three Russian warships near Iki Island at 10 o'clocK

NEW YORK. June 15.â At the .point where the General Slocum lies snb
merged the water is deep and the currents are swift and beyond a doubt
many bodies have been borne along with the tide, to be given up en a later
day at some distant point. There are a number of places where the livis?
may have landed and it is believed that many that are now reported miss
ing are safe and eventually will be heard frcm by the officials who have
the rescue work In hand. To-night a surprising number cf persons repcrt?d
to these officials that they had been saved, thus cutting the list of missing
down considerably, as well as the probab!e mortality list.
Many persons were injured in the panic that followed the breaking out cf
the flames on the Slocum. At least 100 were taken to the hospitals. Not a
death has occurred in the hospitals.
Perhaps the most remarkable case In the many appalling experiences cf
those who were on the Slocum was that of Miss Clara Hartman. who was
picked up for dead, was towed behind a boat for several miles, was wrap
ped in a tarpaulin, was tagged and then recovered consciousness. It Is now
believed she will recover.
Although a great number of the bodies were mutilated and the clothing
badly burned, valuables have been taken from the dead to the amount of
$Â£00,000. â¢Â¦- -â¢ â¢

The proclamation issued by Mayor McCleCan was as foEow*:
"To the Citizens of New York: The appalling disaster yesterday, by
which more than 500 men. women and children lost their lives by fire and
drowning, has shocked and horrified our city. Knowing the keen sympathy
of the people of the city of New York with their strlckenfellowa, I have ap
pointed a committee of citizens to receive contributions to a fund to pro
vide for the fit and proper burial of the dead and for such ether relief as
may be necessary.

"Until the committee has had an opportunity to organize I shall be glad
to receive contributions at the Mayor's office.
"As a sign of mourning I have ordered the flags of the City Hall to be
put at half mast."
Mayor McCIellan said a suggestion had been made that he name a day
for a publfc memorial service and that he had taken the sn^gestion under
advlsement.
The Mayor declared that Investigation disclosed that the city officials
were absolutely powerless to take any steps to prevent a repetition of the
accident. They have no right to take a single step looking to the Inspection
of any steamboat or to recommend any measures for its safety, as the Fed
eral Government has complete jurisdiction.

TOKIO, June IS.â The Russian hope of relieving the pressure on Port
Arthur by threatening- the rear cf General Oku, the commander of the Jap
anese fcrces investing the Russian stronghold, came to an end yesterday at
Telissu. a pcint on the railroad fifty miles north of KInchou and twenty-
Cvt miles north of Vafangow, when the Russians were outmaneuvered
enveloped and sweepingly defeated. They left more than 500 dead en the
field and the Japanese captured 300 prisoners and fourteen quick-firing field
guns. The Russians retreated hastily to the northward. â¢
The Japanese charge that the Russians -violated the Japanese flag.
Certain officers aver that during the fighting a body of Russian soldiers
appeared, carrying a Japanese flag, and that the Japanese artillery, deceived
by this, ceased firing upon that particular body of Russians. Official dis
patches from the Japanese commanders make specific charges of this flag
violation.
Early estimates cf the Japanese losses at Telissu say that 10CO men were
killed or wounded.
JAPANESE ARTILLERY BEGINS THE BATTLE.
The Japanese attacking force was divided Into right and left columns
ard began the advance on Tuesday, along both sides of the railroad. They
encountered the Russians east of Vafangtien and drove them back. At a
late hcur in the afternoon the Russians held a line between Lungwangtiao
and Tafangshen. The Japanese artillery opened on this line and the Rus
sians responded- The shelling continued far two hours and It was followed
by the advance cf the Japanese line to a position extending from Lungchia
tur ts Yuhotun.
Darkness put an end to the fighting. The Japanese dispatched a col
umn to the westward, toward Fuchou. for the purpose of covering the
Russian right wing and to protect their left and rear.
During the night it became apparent that the Russians were being re
irfcrced and it was decided to make a general attack in the morning and
fcrce the Russians Into a defile back of Tellsiu.
RUSSIAN DEFEAT BECOMES A ROCT.
When morning came It was discovered that the Russians held a line
extending from Tafangshen to Chengtxushan. with a force estimated at
more **i>v two drriaions.
The Japanese planned to enveiop the Russians near Telissu, and they
succeeded admirably. 'While the main Japanese fore* was moving north
along the railroad, columns were swung to the left and to the right, and
finally converged at noon on the main Russian position. The Russians in
this position were at a disadvantage, but they held it with determination
until 3 o'clock in th* afternoon. At this hour they were routed.
Tb* Japanese cavalry continued to pursue the enemy --d probably in
flicted considerable punishment.
The JaDanese commander makes no estimate of the Russian losses, but
says they probably were great.

ST. PETERSBURG AD3ETTS DEFEAT.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 15.â The War Office announces that General
Stakelberg was forced back before greatly superior numbers and retreated
to Vantrialin. thirty miles north of Vafangow. The officials here deny that
there was anything in the nature of a rout. The enemy had more than four
divisions in action.
A special dispatch from Llaoyang to the Official Messenger says the
battle of Vafangow raged the whole of yesterday, and. the Japanese re
ceiving considerable retnforcernents.crushed the Russians' left flank and
compelled the Russians to retire northward. No estimate of the losses is
given and no mention is made of the loss of the Russian guns.
The popular disappointment felt in St. Petersburg over the result of
Lieutenant GenÂ«ral Stakelberg s fight, which It had been hoped for the
r-aÂ« thirty-six hours might turn out to be a victory, is tempered som--
T-nat by the knowledge that the Russian force was overwhelmed by num
bers. General ..Stake! berg does not attempt to conceal the seriousness of his
Josses, but his report and the reports from all other Russian sources aeree
that the retreat was in no sens*- a rout. The fierce character of th* fijrht
is rr-ade evident by the fact that the Russians were again forced to "aban
don their runs, thus indicating, as in previous encounters, the suDeriorltv
cf the Japanese artillery.
The Russian official reports of the losses are awaited with the keenest
interest. The War Office de-lines to accept the Japanese fizares unrf
sorrediy. although the officials frankly admit that they believe the Rus
sian cisti3]tS* > 3 were severe. "

NEW YORK, June 16. â All day long, from sunrise until

midnight there had been recovered 541 bodies, for the greater part
women and. children â mothers who weeks ago had planned the
fatal outing for their children ; little ones who had longed for the
coming of the happy day.

of these more than 300 were identified. The East Side had it3
human sympathies aroused to the fullest extent, and down by the

throughout the day. Streets leading to the morgue were blocked,
and only with difficulty. could the police keep clear the passage*
leading to the. long rows of coffins for those who came to search
Up the sound, where the hulk of the General Slocum iie3
submerged, showing only a paddle-box, scores of small craft aid
ed the tugs in grappling for the victims. -Divers went down
time and again, and when their work ended for the day they
declared there were no more bodies in the wreck. A score of
times a diver reappeared after his plunge "with the body of a
woman or a child. Two of them came to the surface together on
one occasion, having in their ai ms two little girls, sisters, clasped
in each other's embrace, and their mother, whose hand tightly
clenched the skirt of one of them.

odd commodities, the more important
of, which in California are ' pickled

Governor isobrikuff was taken to a
huepitul at Helstnefors.
General Count Bobrikoff. who was
appointed Governor General of ' Fin
land In 1S9:Â«. made himself very unpop
ular Ly his severe measures against
the press i>f Finland and the stern
n;aniur in which he followed out the
policy of Russia towards the Finns.
While little is known here concern
"^ing the motives behind the Ehootine.
i he authorities entertain no doubt that
it grew out of opposition to the policy
ot the Rufsification of Finland. The
question of the convocation of the Diet,
which is regarded as one of the most
vital institutions of Finnish national
life find which has not been convoked
lur over a year, aroused much feelinc
General Bobrikoff was at first opposed
to the convocation of the Diet but re
cently the Governor General decided to
recommend that the Diet should be
allowed to meet.
The following statement has been
made:
"In view of the attempt on the life
of Governor General Bobrikoff the de
cision of the Emperor will probably
be agrainst the convocation of the Diet.
t-o that the people of Finland as well
M th*> Governor General shall be corn
lulled to suffer instead of benefit by
crime.
"General Bobrikoff as administra
tor was naturally unpopular with that
vortion of the population which op
fiosed the policy of Russification. He
vas personally hauhgty and austere
and ruled firmly, but Justly.
"Of late a better disposition has
been manifested toward General Bob
rikoff and the Russian administration,
owing to a better understanding and
to the knowledge that the Governor
General favored a meeting of the Diet.
"Last December an attempt was
made upon the life of the Chief of
Police at Helsingsfors and therefore
this is the second act of violence
within six months."

China Makes No Protest.
FT. PETERSBURG. June 16. â Chi
na has not made a protest against the
erection of a wireless telegraph pole
on the property of the Russian Con

Russia is as heretofore outlined. Rus
sia has decided not to adhere to the
Danish-Netherlands arbitration treaty
until after the war ends.
right on the valley of the Tassa, which
flows parallel with the railroad, falling
into the sea ten miles south of Pitzewo.
After a day's rest the enemy ad
vanced fifteen miles on June 14 and'
attacked the Russian . position, four
miles south of Vafangow. The Rus
sians had the better of the first day's
flght, annihilating. a Japanese cavalry
squadron and taking some prisoners,
although at nightfall both armies re
tained their positions. .' "
Yesterday's battle was over a rough
country, where artillery was_ very ef
fect ive. The Russian* lines "extended
between the villages of Lanchou, near
the railroad, and Fafangopen. The
Japanese were between Tafanchou and
Hunchou. Stakelberg's reserves were
held at Slsan,- a short distance from
Vafangow station. The Japanese re
serves were south of Tafanchou. - :.-'
General Nozu's artillery began the day
by shelling the Russian right, while his
sharpshooters were busy with the
other wingj Stakelberg was not cer
tain whenre the main attack
would be delivered and sent out cav
alry to the heights of Lanchou to re
connoiter. Having ascertained that the
enemy was not moving in that quarter
he attacked the Japanese center and
left, in order to drive the enemy
against the - railroad. The Japanese
countered by moving up reserves in an
effort to turn the Russian right. ' A ;
half-hour later Stakelberg ordered his
reserves to move from Slsan to repel
the Japanese flanking; tactics, in the
meanwhile continuing his attack on the
enemy's left and center. This was the
situation when Kuropatkin's report
was received.
RUSSIAN FORCES DIVIDED.

NEWCHWANG, June 16. â Firing

tTorTof Kaichou since 10 o'clock last
night. Two batteries of artillery rush

second division of General Kurokl's
army was reported to be marching to

the purpose of attacking the enemy in
the rear. .- :> â¢

On June 13 two Japanese divisions
were five miles north of the scene of
the skirmish, their left wing resting
on the village of Vafangow and their
JAPANESE BEGIN* ATTACK.
The losses on the Russian side, more
than 300 on Tuesday, show that the
fighting has been of a desperate char
acter, and General Kuropatkin's re
port this morning proves that both
armies are determined to force mat
ters to a decisive issue.
Kuropatkin's dispatch, given out
this morning, brought the report up to
2:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon, but
stopped- at the most critical point of
the battle, when Stakelberg was meet
ing an attempt to turn his right wing
by a similar move around Nozu's left
flank. Stakelberg's reserves had al
ready, been brought up and the Jap
anese had "been heavily reinforced. f

ed, commands the First Siberian Di

The operations leading up to the
battle of Vafangow date back to June
11, when two Japanese divisions, one
commanded by General Nozu, ad
vanced from thfe Pulantlen-Pitzewo
line, probably prompted by the Intel
ligence that the Russians were receiv
ing reinforcements. A sharp skirmish
took place the night of June 12 at
the village of Oudadien, five miles
west of the railroad and seven miles
south of Wafangtien, and another
skirmish occurred on the heights near
the village of Lidlatum, ten miles east
of Oudiaden. The Japanese were re
pulsed, but the Russian advance posts
retired.
FIGHTING IS DESPERATE.
"According to information received,
the enemy during the morning of June
15 brought up considerable reinforce
ments, and as the main Japanese force
consists of upward of three divisionsâ"
The dispatch broke oft* at this point.
Emperor Nicholas has received the
following dispatch, dated June 15, from
General Kuropatkin:
"An engagement occurred on June
14 at Wafangtien (north of Port Ar
thur) with a Japanese force number
ing at least two divisions. Our losses
in killed include Colonel Khoastonnow,
commanding the First Repiment of
Eastern Siberian Rifles, and Second
Lieutenant Dragoslaff Nadochlnsky,
adjutant of the regiment. The wound
ed include Major General Goingross,
who remained on the field, and Cap
tain Krintsky of the general staff.
"Twenty officers, whose names are at
present unknown, were killed or
wounded, besides 311 soldiers, of which
the First Regiment of Siberian Rifles
lost twelve officers and 200 men and the
First Brigade of Artillery six officers
and fifty men.
"The following night was quiet until
2 o'clock in the morning, when a fusil
lade began on our right flank along the
line of our Outposts. The firing soon
slackened. At 5:30 o'clock. In the morn
ing ' the Japanese artillery opened on
our left flank. Shortly before this our
cavalry discovered on our right flank
the presence, southward of Tafanchou,
of a considerable force of the enemy.
The Japanese infantry opened fire .on
our cavalry, occupying the heights.be
tween Tafanchou and Linchou, on the
edge of a wood.
CAXXOXADE BECOMES HEAVIER.
"Toward 6:20 o'clcick the enemy, con
sisting of a regiment of infantry, with
artillery, attacked from these woods.
At the same time the cannonade on our
ltft flank became heavier.
"At 6:30 o'clock General Baron Stak
elberg passed with part of his force to
the attack, turning the right flank of
the enemy toward Wafangtien and
Hunchou, and directing the other part
of his force against the enemy's front.
Toward^lO o'clock in the morning the
enemy' sent a brigade of infantry, cav
alry and a battery of artillery against
our right flank, and having repulsed
our detachments of cavalry proceeded
through Hunchou, turning the right
flank of our position.
"General Stakelberg at 10:30 o'clock
in the evening advanced his reserves to
check this movement.
REPORT OF KUKOPATKIX.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 16 (6:36
| p. m.).â Special dispatches dated June
15 from Vafanpow say the Japanese
iurinjr the first day's fighting had a
battery of six-inch guns. These re
port^ unite in saying that the Russians
several times repulsed the enemy,
speak especially of the fine work of
the Russian artillery and report that
the Japanese losses, which include
quite a number of prisoners captured,
were much heavier than those of the
Russians.- They estimate that the ene
my's battery fired 2500 rounds in the
first day's fighting. .
A semi-official dispatch from Muk
den, dated June 16, says the - engage
ment at Vafangow on June 14 and 15
was undertaken . with the i object of
drawing off a portion of the Japanese
forces from Port Arthur, and resulted
in improving the Russian position.
The Japanese losses were very heavy.
Another correspondent, describing
the fighting, writes:
"The date, June 14, will forever ; be
memorable in our' annals. A'succes
sion of furious attacks by two divisions
of the enemy and batteries of six-inch
guns were repelled by our troops, who
nowhere yielded an inch of ground,
despite heavy losses. The Fourth Bat
tery lost many gunners, but did not
waver. Our suns were served superb
ly, paralyzing the; attack of the Jap
anese infantry and causing their bat
teries to recoil. The soldiers of the Si
berian Rifle regiments behaved mag
nificently. All the troops are full of
enthusiasm."

A pall hung to-day over the public
school on Fifth street, near First
avenue, which is in the center of the
residence district most affected by the
Slocum disaster. Of the 2000 pupils
of the school a large portion were
relatives of the excursionists and near
ly 300 of the regular attendants did
not appear in their classes to-day. Of
this number 110' had obtained per

how many lost their lives or were in

of boys^and girls their eyes red with
weeping, to-day asked to be excused
because a brother or sister or other
relatives had been lost. In every
room there were vacant seats. Study
was almost out of the question. The
school flags hunjr at half mast.
During yesterday 203 persons were
taken to hospitals. After treatment

He lost, besides his wife and daugh

"When I first discovered the pres
ence of tire on the steamer I decided
to make for the first dock that I
could find, but in a moment I was
informed that all the ropes by which
we usually tied up had been burned.
Then I decided to make for the first
point of land where there were no
rocks and beach the vessel, and this I
did. The presence of rocks all along
the shore made it impossible for me
to beach the vessel any sooner than
I did."
A particularly sad incident during
Pilot Van Wart, however, to-day
said that he could not dock the ves
sel because all of her hawsers were
burned. His statement follows:
There is o:>en criticism of the fail
ure of the Slocum's officers and crew
to meet the emergency, but as yet no
formal action has been taken by
either the municipal or Federal au
thorities. Captain Van Schaick and
the two pilots are under arrest, but
are held only as witnesses.
That there was terrible failure to
meet the responsibilities is undoubt
ed. N'o effort, as far as can be
learned, was made to launr-h the life
rafts or boats and no concerted at
tempt was made toward equipping the
helpless women and children with life
preservers. But few of tnose rescued
and few of the bodies recovered from
the rK-er had on life preservers, and
most of these supposed instruments
of safety were practically worthless.
There is very general criticism of
the captain and pilots for their failure
to turn the vessel ashore the moment
they were informed the fire had
gained headway. Captain Van fichaick
has made several statements, .varying
in details, but none of them is con
sidered satisfactory.

DEAD STEWARD ROBBED.
There were rescues in the face of al
most certain death and useless, but
exalted self-sacrifice. The credit for
the greatest saving of life is due to
the hardy tugfcoat men and other fol
lowers cf the river, who braved the
flames and held the noses of their craft
against the fire-warped steamboat un
tii driver, off by the awful heat, scorch
ed and choking. Bodies of women with
their burned arms clasping close the
pitiful forms cf little children and
babies v.ere found.
JJRITAL AND COWARDLY ACTS.
But there is a darker side hinted at
along the river front, where are told
stories that stem to be the inevitable
accompaniment of all great calami
ties. There has been no evidence of a
character si>ecific enough to fasten it
upon individuals and permit of pun
ishment, but survivors and eyewitness
es say that some brutal acts of seifish-
Deoa and cowardice on the part of the
Slocum's crew were seen and that dis
tress siffnals from the burning boat
were disregarded by passing: craft. One
man avers that a big Tihlte yacht
passed the Slocum v.htn the bodies of
wonv=-n and children were going over
board and did not even slacken ppeÂ«?d.
According to this man. the yacht flew
the pennant A>t the New York Yytht
Club, but rot the owner's pennant,
Â¦which always signifies that he is
;-l>oard, and after passing the Slocum
!?he steered over to the western shore
and hove-to. while on her bridge a
man in uniform, with binoculars to his
eyes, watched the vessel burn.
Even more horrible than this and
similar acts cf incredible callousness is
The race of the burning steamboat
iroin the moment the fire was dis
covered until her bows crashed on the
shelving beach of North Brother Isl
and lasted little more than ten min
utes, yet that lime sufficed for deeds
of heroism which make the one bright
chapter in the heart rending story.
Brave men. devoted mothers and even
maidens and youth? of tender years
each contributed their part to the roll
of heroic acts.

MOURNING JLS MANY HOMIiS.
All during the night and through
the early dawn of to-day the sad
work of exploring the Slocum's hull
went on and from dock to morgue the
procession of ambulances, each with
Its pitiful load, wound its way from
the river front to the morgue at the

Most of these came from the wreck,

OGDEN, Utah, June 16 (on board
California delegation's special train).â
The terrors . of Nevada's wind-swept
desert have been overcome and drafts
of wine and sparkling waters have
washed down the last fleck of alkali
that parched the palates of these most
grateful passengers.
To-day was given over to the en
tertainment of the Nevada delegation,
which after the eastern border of the
State was left behind numbered five,
Dr. S. L. Lee of Carson, E. S. Farring
ton of Elko, B. Reymers of Dayton, R.
S. Meacham of Virginia City and Col
onel H. B. Maxson of Reno (alternate).
These delegates will be joined at Chi
cago by H. "Bun-ell, who is in the East,
and Frank McNamee, who leaves Salt
Lake to-day for the convention city.
Nevada's delegates were cordially
greeted by the Californians,. the Ha
waiians and J. M. Switzer, the one del
egate from the Philippines, who took
passage on this train.
After the health of the men from the
sagebrush State had been largely
toasted, they were given a corner In
the smoker that they might confer un
disturbed. After some discussion, Dr.
S. L. Lee of Carson City was selected
chairman, E. S. Farrington was named
to. represent the State on the commit
tee to formally notify President Roose
velt of his nomination for the office he
now nils, and Alternate Maxson was
delegated to perform the same function
in reference to the nominee for Vice
President.
R. S. Meacham was appointed to act
for Nevada as honorary vice chairman
of the convention. " Pj L. .Flanigan,
present national committeeman from
Nevada, will be recommended to
the convention for reappointment. Dr.
S. L. Lee, who was named chairman of
his delegation, won this honor by his
fealty to his party through two cam
paigns in his State that were fraught
with discouragement.
Regarding the political conditions
prevailing In Nevada, Chairman Lee
said:
"The next campaign will find Nevada
engaged in one of the hardest fights in
her history. . .
"Since 1896 the State has been fanat
ically behind the silver movement, but
this year we are going to take the full
est advantage of what seems to be a
possible/ even probable, opportunity to
send Republicans to 'Washington. Min
eral as well as political conditions are
winning the State back to Republican-
Ism, and It Is my opinion that the next
fight Is the last that the supporters of
silver will make.
"Nevada Is rapidly becoming: a gold

The impression that Victor H. Met
calf cannot decline the great honor and
privilege of serving in the Cabinet of
President Roosevelt is general in the
Third CongressionalDistrict. The pro
motion of Mr. Metcalr will not deprive
the district of representation in Con
gress. Several Veil known Republican
State Senatorsâ for Instance, Joseph R.
Knowland, Charles M. Belshaw, P. W.
Leavitt and G. R. Lukensâ are willing
to serve the people as Representative
in Congress. The State Senators are
not all. who are ready to undertake the
responsibility of a term in Congress.
There is Thomas RIckard of Berkeley,
one of the progressive and active Re
publicans of the Third District. He
stands high in the favor of the State
administration and is close up to the
workers who advanced the political
fortunes of Charles H. Spear, president
of the Board of State Harbor Com
missioners. While Alameda County is
presenting a bunch of exemplary as
pirants for the Metcalf Â¦ succession.
Contra Costa and Solano counties must
be considered in the reckoning. Sena
tor Belshaw has nerve and ambition
as well as the means to put up a
hustling good fight for nomination and
election. His ability as a slate smash
er has been demonstrated on more than
one occasion. It is common gossip in
political circles that Senator Perkins
recently advised against an extension
of Belshaw's career in the Legislature
and this incident may stimulate .the
supporters of Belshaw to universal ac
tivity in the contest for Congressional
recognition. Complaint comes from
Solano County that Mr. Metcalf has
been advising the Republicans of that
county on the subject of selecting a
man to represent Solano and Napa
counties in the upper house of the
Legislature. The story comes that the
Republicans of the Senatorial district

are ready to resent what they are con
strained to term an interference In
their local affairs. It would not be sur
prising if Lieutenant Governor Alden
Anderson should enter the contest as
a candidate to represent the Third Dis
trict in the hallsNof Congress. It is
common rumor that Mr. Anderson ex
pects in the future to go a step higher
on the gubernatorial ladder, but a term
in Congress would not lessen his
chances of becoming Governor. Secre
tary of State Charles F. Curry enter
tains an ambition to occupy the exe
cutive office In the State Capitol and he
would not care if the Lieutenant Gov
ernor should be chosen to succeed Vic
tor Metcalf.
There will be a meeting of the exe
cutive committee of the Republican
State Central Committee this evening

Hotel and the official call for 4he con

By unanimous vote the Election
Commissioners decided yesterday
evening that they have no jurisdiction
in the matter of Justices of the Peace.
The opinion read by Commissioner
Devoto confirmed that of City Attor
ney Percy V. Long to the effect that
Peace Justices are State officials and
therefore did not come within the
rulings of the charter. The board be
lieved that as municipalities were
formed by power of the State consti
tution they were consequently subor
dinate to it. In regard to the tenure
of office of Isadore. Golden, Justice of
the Peace, the Commissioners say that
any one who cares to contest it may
do so. They hold that the term of
office for Peace Justices is four years,
as provided for by the constitution un
der a recent amendment.
THEY ARE STATE OFFICIALS.
It is openly announced by many of
the delegates that in giving Knight the
committeeship the delegation will only
act in deference to the wishes of Presi
dent Roosevelt, who demonstrated his
regard for Knight when he personally
requested that Knight second his nom
ination in the Chicago convention.
The journey overland bo far has been
delightful. Colonel Kowalsky's punch
has been a feature to impress the mem
ory, and Secretary Steppacher's liber
ality in dispensing it the source of con
gratulations. There are few things on
this train that are causing worry.
Turning from the politics of Nevada
back to those of California, there ,is
only one ripple of dissension, so far aÂ»
the national delegation is concerned,
to record. Ruef still wants to be na
tional committeeman, notwithstanding
the fact that Geprge A. Knight is
looked upon as the inevitable winner of
the honor. Ruef refuses to permit his
aspirations to die. He was generally
probing the situation to-day, but the
biggest men of the delegation don't see
where Knight can lose. Delegates
Countryman, Porter and Philips, it is
known, favor Ruef, but it is hardly ex
pected that they will be able tb clothe
him with the honor he seeks.
In event, of Roosevelt's defeat at the
next election â a hardly possible contin
gency â Judge Hawley, tt is said, will

Roosevelt may appoint his successor. If
President Roosevelt is elected Judge
Hawley will retain his position until
the burden of his years compels him

distinguished lawyer of Elko, who will
have as his only opponent for the office
General James D. Tarreyson, an ex-

CHICAGO, June 16. â After decid
ing several State contests on delegates
at large to the Republican National
Convention and a number of district
disputes, the Republican National
Committee adjourned until to-morrow
morning, leaving the biggest fight, that
of the factions of Wisconsin, still un
settled.
While there was much interest
taken in the settlement by the com
mttlee of the contests in Delaware and
Louisiana to-day, the quarrel in Wis
consin is regarded as the most serious

iously awaited by Republicans and
Democrats alike.
Iti the D^l.i-.vare contest the com
mittee this afternoon decided unani
mously to seat the Delaware delega
tion which is headed rjy J. E. Addicks.
It was also decided to seat the colored
delegates at large from Louisiana, who
are opposed to the "lily white" Re
publican* of Louisiana.
The colleagues of Mr. Addicks who
Â¦were given seats are United States
Senator J. Frank Allee, John Hunn
and Caleb R. Layton.
Some surprise was occasioned when,
by a vote of 23 to 13. the committee
decided to seat the delegates at Jarge
from Louisiana who are opposed to
the "lily white" element. Not only
the contending party, the Cohen fac
tion, wins in the matter of delegates
at large, but their representatives were
victorious in practically ail of the dis
trict contests in thai State. The "lily
white" faction expected the contest
n ould be de< ided in their favor and
the colored delegates had practically
given up hope of being successful be
fore the committee. When the vote
was announced the negro delegates
hurriedly left the committee room to
tell their friends assembled in a room
adjoining. Instantly there were loud
ehouts by all the negroes who were
present and it was some minutes be
fore the committee could proceed with
its work. The recognized delegates at
large are Walter L. Cohen, Emile N.
Kuntz, Girault Farrar and H. B. N.
Brown.
It can be stated that before Attor
ney General Knox decided to leave the
Cabinet to become Senator from Penn
sylvania, President Roosevelt consid
ered the appointing of Metcalf Sec
retary of the Navy when Mr. Moody
would retire on March 4, 1905.
NEW YORK, June 16. â The con

to be that Congressman Dayton of

C Your brain is tied pretty
closely to your digestive
machinery.
CLike a coal fire when
it gets clinkered up, it's
generally the fuel that's to
blame.
C" FORCE "is what you
might call a "free-burn-
ing" food.
C If you eat plenty of it
you won't have those
stuck -in -the -mud days
when everything seems
to be going backward in-
stead of forward. -^
\ Â¦
Wbes yon bey coal you find eoae stone*
Bixed with it. Thrte stones co*t as much
as the coal. They also take op and waste
Bore heat tban the coal they displace
would fcave devr loprd.
Just so with the foods yon eat which yon
do cot digest.
People who would quickly build Brawn,
Brain, and Bone should eat plenty of
. "FORCE."
Because it is cot only rich in the Phos-
phates and Nitrogen of Wheat that bolld
Brain, Nerve, and Brawn, but is malted
with Barley, so that it dicests other foods
in the stomach, extracting greater nutri-
tion from them.
Serve cold (or hot) with real Cream, or
Fruit.

BÂ£GAIÂ» SHOES.
JTROM the day we opened
the first Regal Shoe Store,
we have been telling the
public how shoes are made.
The shoemen say that we have told
trade secrets â but we have nothing to
conceal, believing that everyone should
know what they .are purchasing.
The Buzz -Saw in our
windows dissected all makes
of shoes.
"The Window of the Sole"
on Regal Shoes proves the
presence of genuine old-fashioned oak
bark tanned sole leather before you pu*-
What would you think of
a man who sold you a hat
pieced or patched under the
ribbon ? yTv.
All other shoes sold for less
than $6.00 are made with
pieced or patched vamp concealed under
Â¦ the toe cap.
- Cutting off the end of the vamp means
a saving of about six cents per pair to
the manufacturer.
The consumer knows nothing about
j this until the shoe loses its shape or
| bursts out.
Every one of our new Spring Regals
[ â Oxford, blucher, lace or button. King
i Calf, King Kid, russet, waxed, patent
I or enamel â has the same unmistakable
custom-made appearance that the ex-
clusive New York bootmakers charge
$10.00 and $12.00 a pair for.
. It's going to be; another Oxford year.
Regal Oxfords fit at ankle and instep â
no slipping up and down, no chafing, no
" gapping " at the sides.
THS SHOE THAT PROVS8
There are 72 Regal Stores. 25 of them
In Greater New York, Â¦where the styles
Â¦ originate. The new styles are on sale at
i our San Francisco Store at the same time
as in the New York Stores.
Women's Regal Shoes embody all the
\ latest custom designs of leading boot-
makers ofJVew York, London and Paris,
go new stylesâ one priu.

Enormous Reductions from The Emporium's regular prices (lowest in California).
The bare facts about the cEoihing are stated in the headlines. The garments are this sea-
son's newest and most desirable styles, in the medium weight fabrics that Californians
wear all the year around. They are perfectly cot acd well cixie, acd u-- guarantee jpve the best cf wear
and satfsf action. Their only fault irÂ». ccr eyes is that there are but a few dozen suits at each of the prices
from which we have reduced them, the sizÂ«5 being broken, but tn the fail assortment at each seTEo-2 price yea

WBlilln lflH^illÂ»*iMM ,~WASHINGTON, June 16.â The State
Department has received the follow
ing under date of yesterday by cable
from Mr. Gummore, American Con
sul General at Tangier:
"As reported yesterday, Raissouli
has increased his demands. I am in
formed to-day by the Minister of For
eign Affairs that one of the sheiks and
two of his brothers, whose apprehen
sion were demanded by Raissouli have
been arrested; also that a courier has
been dispatched this morning to Rais
souli to say that his further demands
will probably be granted by the Mo
roccan government if the captives are
released." â¢ .
LONDON, June 17.â The correspond
ent of the Times at Tangier points out
that the concession of the bandit Rais
souli's new demand for the Governor

Electrical Engineer at White's Hill
' Tnnncl Proves That It Was
Stolen From Him.
Captain Martin received a letter
yesterday from Arthur B. Saunders,
engineer and electrician at the North
Shore Railroad camp No. 1, White's
Hill Tunnel, in which, the writer
states that he believes the revolver
taken from Gurt Burnell. the footpad,
belongs to him. Saunders said that
a revolver was stolen from his room
at the camp about three weeks ago.
In his letter he gives the number and
description of the stolen weapon,
which seems to be identical with the
one found on Burnell.
Saunders also said that a man
named Burrell. "who had been work
ing at the camp, had disappeared
about the same time as the revolver.
The police have sent a photograph of
Burnell to Saunders to see if he can
identify him and asklnsr if any one
else left the cams at the same time
as Burnell.
Burnell was questioned by Detec
tives Dinan and Wren about the re
volver, but he claimed that the wea
pon had been in his possession for a
long time and that he had come hero
from Wadsworth. Nev. The detectives
have been unable to find the location
of his room or ~a~ny trace of his com
panion.
Southern Pacific Employes Can Find
No Inducement for Ending Their
Present Strike.*
A special meeting of the freight
handlers of the Southern Pacific
Company, held last evening in Alcazar
building, resulted in no change in the
present condition. ' It was made
clear to the men by their committee,
which waited on General Manager
of the railroad company
three days ago. that there would be
nothing gained in declaring the strike
off, for the company had declined to
make anjÂ£ concessions to its employes
other than to take them back as fast
as vacancies occurred. This was in
terpreted as meaning that none of the
present non-union force would be
discharged to make room for the old
employes. As a result the men took
no action toward bringing the strike
to an end.
It is announced that the telegraph
operators employed by the Union Pa
cific Railroad Company have, after
several months' consideration, set
tled their differences with the com
pany in so far as wages and hours are
concerned, and that the threatened
trouble that might have resulted from
the company's inability to secure
competent train dispatchers and
operators have been removed.

from the law establishing mercantile

against the protest of the Government

passed. During the debate upon the
measure one of the speakers jocularly
referreu to the sympathetic attitude of
Countess von Bulow, wife of the Im

Posadowski-Wehner, wife of the Min
ister of the Interior, toward the
women's movement, expressing the
hope that these ladies would eoften the
hard hearts of their husbands.

clared it was a duty born of interna

greeting to "such distinguished women,
some of whom look back upon glorious
achievements," but the extension of
such greetings did not necessitate the
acceptance of their entire programme,
especially their demand for political
suffrage for women.

OAKLAND. June 16.â -She Stoops to
Conquer." O!ivcr Goldsmith's famous
comedy, was presented this even
ing at the Macdonough Tfieater
by the eraduating class of the Oak
land High School, and if a crowded
house and plenty of stirring applause
Ftand for anything, then must stu
dents and *u'iiÂ» a nce have been mutual
ly pleased. The costumes were both
rich and becoming, the girls looking
particularly attractive with patch and
powdered wig. . .
It is a difficult thing for nould-bs
frraduates to prepare for linal exam
inations and to study out the humoi
of a Goldsmith comedy at the same
lime vitb success, but these clever
youn;? people were not lo be daunted,
and thc'.r i-ourage >vas rewarded to
nipht by the unstinted praise of their
friend*, occasionally a line was for
gotten or a bit of "stage business"
overl'Miked, bv.t the audience was in
dultrcnt. remembering the 'ologies an-i
thmps that have been weighing^n the
minds of these young aspirants for
irradiating honors for the last few
months.
Explanations in the Police Court fol
lowed and Lawless was discharged,
while his sifter's husband was sent
back to a cell for three days.
Mrs. Cook decided she had been
n bused, hence the divorce proceedings.
As soon as her husband was released
he discovered that the household be
longings had. disappeared. He claimed
that Lawless had stolen them and in
cluded a lot <jf contracts and docu
ments Cook used in an installment
business. Therefore he swore to a
complaint charging grand larceny.
\V. H. O'Brien. Mrs. Cook's attorney,
says there Is no question that the ef
fects were removed, but, the lawyer
explains, they were taken at the in
stance of Mrs. Cook, who has a legal
claim upon them.
Events led to-day to Lawless' arrest
on complaint of his brother-in-law,
Â«'ock, en a charge of stealing valuabje
documents from the Cook domicile,
1455 Broadway. Mr. Cook declares this
occurred while he was serving a threw
days' sentence in the City Prison for
drunkenness. During the same interval
Mrs. Cook begun a divorce suit against
her incarcerated spouse, alleging cru
elty.
Matters opened on June 5, when
Lawless was arrested on complaint of
Cook, who said his brother-in-law had
disturbed his peace by raising a row at
the hou?e. lawless was hardly in jail
before Cook was picked up by a police
man for intoxication.
Three arrests and a divorce suit is
the record to date in the disturb
ances that have brought woe and do
mestic upheaval in the family of Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Cook, with William
J. Lawless, Mrs. Cook's brother, a third
party in interest.

Accused of robbing hundreds of hen
roosts, Frank Tietz was to-day* con
victed by- a jury of burglary in the
first degree and will receive his sen
tence next Saturday. Nearly every
home in the Fruitvale district has had
cause to mourn the loss of carefully
raised broods.^ The stealing was done
by the wholesale, and Phillips & Lease,
poultry, dealers, testified to-day that
they had bought chickens by the dozen
from Tietz and thought he was the pro
prietor of a chicken ranch. Day after
day he made his sales and each night
furnished him with more chickens.
Tietz's downfall came when he went
to the home of John Ruasell. who lives
at Twenty-sixth street and Twenty
second avenue. In a house there he
found thirteen light Brahmas. They
were of a fancy breed and about half
grown and he took them all. He sold
them to Phillips & Lease at Twelfth
and Webster streets for $4. Russell tes
tified to-day that he valued them at
from $5 to $10 each. As soon as he dis
covered his loss Russell started for the
markets and found his chickens at the
first place he visited. Lease had pur
chased the birds only a short time be
fore and was able to give such a de
scription of the man that Detectives
Holland and Quigley soon had Tietz in
custody. He was positively identified
by the dealers as the man who had sold
them birds by the wagon load.

ton indicate an Increase in the natural
value of the property of Alameda
County this year of between . J3.000.000

but consists of footings of the figures

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, June 16.
Blake admitted on the stand that he
had met Miss Cronin and Pedlar on
the night of the attack, and was cer
tain as to their identity. He denied
that he had beaten the young woman
and also that he had on a coat of light
color on the night of the assault.
Other witnesses who gave testimony
were Chief of Police John Conrad;
Mrs. Blake, mother of the defendant:
Detective ; George Brown, Otto Ley
decker and A. Anderson. Deputy Dis
trict Attorney W. H. L. Hynes prose
cufted and the defendant was repre
sented by Attorney A. L. Frlck. Com
posing the jury of eleven were Paul G.
Buckley, A. J. Ernest. E. J. Bevan, G.
C. Munro, J. K. Hauck, R. Taylor, Wil
liam Betten, H. Toelken, Henry Bram
man, Harry Atwood and John W. Rew.
Blake has still another charge of bat
tery against him, preferred by Miss
Annie Seebeck. v
DENIES HIS GUILT.
Pedlar stopped the youth and asked
him what his name was and where he
was going. Blake gave his correct name
and said that he resided on "Walnut
street, although his home is on Encinal
avenue. Miss Cronin testified that she
was so frightened when Pedlar caught
Blake that she then refused to posi
tively identify him as her assailant, as
she ffared him and dreaded the noto
riety his arrest wojjld bring her. Pedlar
thereupon released Blake and the latter
made haste to get out of sight. It was
not until the 3d of this month that Miss
Cronin swore to the complaint against
Blake, and that after he had been ar
rested for a similar attack on Miss An
nie Seebeck.
Pedlar corroborated Miss Cronin's
testimony in every detail, and told how
his suspicions were aroused when he
and Miss Cronin met the youth, who
was trembling and breathing heavily.
In response to questions asked him
Blake told Pedlar that he was coming
from a car barn on High street, where
he had been feeding a horse. This
statement by Blake was disproved, as
there is no car barn' on or near High
street.
ALAMEDA, June 16.â In the second
trial of Milton Blake, alias -'Jack the
Swatter," to-day the jury failed to
agree and was discharged at 11 o'clock

discussed the case for eight Hours, and
six were for conviction, the same as on
the first trial. There were but eleven
jurors. â¢_-...
Miss Cronin was the first witness >put
on by the prosecution and positively
identified Blake as the person' who at
tacked and beat her on the night of
February 20 on Santa Clara avenue,
near Everett street. She related care
fully and consistently how, after she
had alighted from an electric car at
the corner of Park street and Santa?
Clara avenue, Blake followed her and
when near Everett street grasped her
by the throat and beat and kicked her
until she fell into the gutter. Then,
Miss Cronin said, her assailant ran to
ward BrGadway and she went back to
Park street, where her screams had at
tracted Hie attention of Elmer E. Ped
lar, who consented to accompany her
to the home of Mrs. Franz Collischonn,
2439 Central avenue, where she is em
ployed. When the pair reached the spot
where the attack had occurred they
met Blake coming directly toward
them. Miss Cronin ' informed her es
cort that the person approaching them
was the one who attacked her.
HE STOPPED BLAIIE.

The location of the settlement to be

Kearny Ftreet and Broadway, a point
close to the county jail and city prison
ar.d In direct contiguity to every spe

For a year the young priest acted as â¢
curate of the Cathedral Mission of the j
Good Samaritan and In arduous en- !
deavor spent his time in ameliorating !
the condition of the poor which j
thronged the doors of that parish.
In the work of the mission Mr. Mor
gan became cognizant of the depths of
misery and despair to which it is pos- '
Bible for certain elements of the dopu- j
lation to gravitate. Even in the worst I
and most hopelees instances Mr. Mor- '
gan was ever sympathetic and quick
to relieve- His wealth was derived
from an aunt, the famous "Middy" j
Morgan, who as stock reporter for a
New Tork paper gained wide notoriety
for her wonderful Judgment of cattle
as well as for her many eccentricities.
Estimates of the amount of the Rev.
Mr. Morgan's fortune differ widely.
P.y some it Is placed at a million dol- 1
lara
In two years Mr. Morgan was or
dained to the ministry by Bishop
Nichols at the Cathedral Mission. Rev.
Charles E* Gardner, now chaplain of
the Stanford University, being ordained
at the same service.
HIS WORK FOR THE POOR.
v. falthlest and most cultured people in
th? State, for a Quixotic purpose of
henefiting <?uch a region like the Bar
t.ary Coast seems incomprehensible.
Those who know Mr. Morgan inti
mately admit that he is sincere in the
undertaking and is acting from a high
s^ns-c of duty, and they look confident
ly for tangible results.
When curate of the Mission of the
Oood Samaritan no task was too great
for his strength or degraded In its na
ture to evoke his sympathy and assist
nnce. Tho same qualities of persever
ance and practical experience in dealing
with the abandoned, together with
preat determination of character, are
hound to win in a field which his
former ministry in this field has made
perfectly familiar to him.
RESCUE WORK IX LOXDON".
In order to be thoroughly equipped
for the work, Mr. Morgan left for Lon
don a few week? ago, and is now resi
dr-nt in a settlement established in
WhiU'chapel, known as the wickedest
pf-ot in civilization and the scene of the
murderous exploits of '"Jack the Rip
per."
In this precinct of London the Sal
vation Army has proved that even
among the most brutal and degraded
? â¢f the population there are many that
tan be influenced for good.
The Anglican church has aJso cs
labliEhf-d refuges and settlements there
which havo accomplished wonders.
Upon the same lines Mr. Morgan pro
poses to establish a settlement where
? very one, no matter what the past
lias been, may find spiritual and bodily
( omfo'rt and encouragement fer a bet
ter life. Mr. Morgan, it is said, pro
poses to devote his large income to
tlii? purpose.
The project is. to a certain extent,
independent of diocesan control, or will
be considered so until the experiment
is given a fair trial.
Mr. Morgan belongs (o the high
church party und holds most advanced
opinions as to the prerogatives of his
church.
CAPABLK OF ANT SACRIFICE.
He is capable of any sacrifice and

thf? strength of a martyr.
Few yo-ung clergymen who have' in
times past officiated in Kplscopal

more agreeably than the Rev. Edward
Morgan.
A member "f "no of the most prom
inent families of Ireland, whose an
Â«r-.stral homo is one of the most hc/s
j>;TablfÂ» and extensive in all its borders,
Mr. Morgan was parly accustomed to
ail tho refinement* and luxury which
unlimited wealth and the most polished
society of his native land could afford.
Tears apo the family purchased a large
raneh in Texas and stocked it with
the finest breed of cattle that could be
had. but the life was c-ne that did not
attract the young Irishman and after
;i year's experience of the uncongenial
life of a cattleman he abandoned Texas
and naturally sought California. By

been, will be welcomed and the way to
better things pointed out.
The friends of the young priestâ and
there are multitudes of themâ are much
astonished. No clergyman of the dio
cese of California had finer prospects
for a distinguished career. Polished in
manners, a student of fine scholarship
and an aristocrat by heredity, the Rev.
Mr. Morgan seemed best fitted for a

FRESNO, June 16. â Frank B. Thomp
son, aged 66, and his brother Uriah,
aged 75, clasped each other In their
arm^ to-day and rejoiced, for they had
not seen or heard of each other for
fifty-one years. Uriah left .their native
State of Arkansas in 1853 and came
West to California. .When the Civil
War broke out both brothers enlisted
in the Union ranks and served three
years. Uriah returned to California,
and in 1875 Frank also came West.
They had heard nothing of each other
during all these years. Frank supposed
his brother had been dead .for some
thirty years, while Uriah had been in
the Soldiers' Home In Southern Cali
fornia and for forty- five years had
neither seen nor heard of a relative.
It was by accident that Frank
learned that his brother was in the
Soldiers' Home. A friend of Uriah no
ticed the resemblance, and through a
conversation Frank found that his
brother had visited friends in Fresno.
He at once sent for him to come to
Fresno.

flag used In,- a hall for decorative pur
poses, the- blue field should be In the
center of the wall on which it is to be
displayed and may be hung so that the
stripes may be either to the right or
left of the center, but if two flags are

fields should be side by side, with the

country. "It Is related," says the Sen

England settlers began to drift to Kan
sas, Missourians tied a cow at each,
crossing of the Missouri River. If the
emigrant said 'cow* he was permitted
to cross, but if he pronounced It 'keow*
he was told to return to the East, be
cause the natives were satisfied that
he was an evil-minded abolitionist.
The Kansas people evened up by tying
a bear on their side of the river and if
the emigrant said 'bear' he was given
the right hand of fellowship, but if he
pronounced it 'bar' he was given an
hour to get back to Missouri, because
he was an advocate of slavery."â New

KASAWAKA, a Japanese student at Yale, con
tributes to a recent number of the Yale Re
â¢ view an article upon the economic aspects of
the present war in the Far East which is well calculated
to.open^the eyes of thinking people to the tremen
dous stake for which the Mikado's empire is fighting.
That Japan, above all other nations whose interests
turn them to the Oriental trade, is fighting for the open
door in China and Manchuria with the desperation that
comes of a threatened national paralysis is the word sent
forth in this well-conceived article of the Yale student.
"Should the markets of East Asia be closed," says the
writer, "Japan's national life would be paralyzed, as
her growing population would be deprived of its food
and occupation." This is because of several changes of
strong economic significance that have come over the
'Japanese empire within the last twenty-five years. An
enormous increase in her population is the fundamental
cause of the rapid transformations that have been made
in industrial and trade conditions. Twenty-five years
ago the population was estimated at 27,200,000; at the
present time the Mikado, has in his empire over 47,000,
000 souls. As a consequence in the foreign trade of
Japan alone the increase for the last quarter century
has been from 49,742,831 yen to almost 600,700,000 yen.
This enormous increase in population and the extent
of commerce" has brought it about that from the agri
cultural nation of twenty-five years ago Japan has be
come like England, an industrial nation whose agricul
tural resources fail of keeping it in a self-supporting
state. The great increase of manufacturing takes away
from the rural population to add to the cities. Raw mate
rial cannot be produced fast enough to supply the de
mand of the manufacturers. Through nearby markets
only can disposition of the surplus production be made
with the facility demanded by economic expediency. In
a word, Japan must grow through untrammeled trade
with her eastern neighbors, else she will be choked with
her own activity.
In his recent appeal to the American people for their
sympathy in behalf of Russia, Count Cassini, the Czar's
representative at Washington, frankly stated that should
Japan be beaten it could expect to be shut out entirely
from the gates of the Asiatic trade, while other nations
would enjoy the favor of the open door at the benefi
cent hand of Russia. Should Japan win it is certain that
not alone the other nations but Russia through her Si
berian possessions will be the gainers. For a Japanese
victory must mean redoubled activity in the Oriental
trade. The pent-up forces of industrial energy, if once
given free let in Korea, and China, must
establish a market of tremendous potentiality.
THE ECONOMIC STAKE IN THE EAST.
By order of the bankers of New Haven all bank clerks
in their service must take an annual vacation of two
weeks. This decision is the prompting of strict business
logic and not of sentiment. And yet Russell Sage lives,
moves and must have his being in an atmosphere where
everybody has a spell of rest and recreation forced upon
him as a matter of duty. This is cruel to the old man.

of Lady Diana was originally written
for Mrs. Charles Calvert, but as that
actress was under engagement at an
other theater this role was given to a
rather inexperienced actress, who on
the first night forgot her part and in
the first act left out two whole pages
of explanation of the why and where
fore of the play. This appalling gap
in the story not only paralyzed the un
fortunate actress, but every one -else
and the first act was taken so slowly
that no one in the audience dreamed
that the play was supposedly farcical.
Recovering themselves somewhat in
the interval the actors started on the
second act and further regaining their
spirits went to the other extreme and
rollicked through the play for all they
were worth. The audience became
more and more puzzled and left the
theater in a somewhat resentful mood.

BRUSSELS, June 1. â It ia not often
that a chance is afforded of gazing
upon unclothed royalty, but one is
THERE is great difference and great variety of,
opinion as to the legal phases of the situation in
Colorado. There are charges and counter-charges
involving the action of politicians and of the Miners'
Union. There is a justifiable aversion in this country
to the existence of military rule anywhere, and nothing
is easier than to excite bitter opposition thereto; but
there exists also a set determination to resist and op
pose rule equally arbitrary, that has not the excuse of
public authority.
The mining region of Colorado that has been for more
than a year the seat of these troubles was, on the face
of the record, subjected to the arbitrary government of
the union miners. Without hindrance by the civil au
thorities those mistaken men had dipped deeply into
crimes. They had rounded up non-union workmen and
deported them from the district, marching them over
iStony trails, murdering many, and indulging in acts of
extreme inhumanity. Their . policy was systematically
carried out. Men were blown into pieces with dynamite.
Owners of mines were assassinated. Mining property
was seized and held against the rights of its lawful own
ers, and a reign of terror was established and main
tained.
The civil law was utterly powerless to protect person
and property, or to punish those who willfully and openly
and daily violated the rights of both. This failure of
the law was due to the fact that the civil officers, in
cluding judges of the courts, were either members of, or
controlled by, the organization that was violating the
law. The Governor of the State finally extended the
arm of executive power and his military authority into
the disturbed district. Order was restored. Mines were
reopened and worked with a full force, and the indica
tions were that the law had been reinstated, and that
the natural and constitutional rights of men were re
stored. Then the Governor .withdrew the troops and the
region again returned to the administration of its civil
officers. Immediately the reign of terror began again.
After some preliminary violations of the law. which were
winked at by the civil authorities, there occurred one of
the most appalling crimes, in the dynamiting to death
of nearly a score of non-union miners, as they quit work
on the night shift and proceeded to their homes.
Look at is as one may. it is of common knowledge
that if the perpetrators of this crime had stood in the
open while doing this wholesale murder they were safe
from punishment. The far-reaching sentiment of ap-*
proval of their act was uttered by a Democratic politi
cian, a delegate to the State convention, who, on hear
ing the news, said: "On general principles I haven't any
sympathy to waste on the fellows who were blown up â
they were working on other men's jobs."
This act was the culmination of events. Either the
State of Colorado must assent to the abdication of the
civil law, and turn the district over to be governed by
a secret organization, which marked inoffensive men for
death and property for destruction, or the State must
act, and how? There was but one way and that was
chosen by the Governor, who ordered the military there
to restore order. The members of the secret organiza
tion were arrested and deported from the district. The
validity of the Governor's act was taken immediately to
the courts, and the Supreme Court decided that his au
thority was ample and that he had proceeded according
to the law of the 3tate. /
We are endeavoring to state merely the record, with
out criticism of any one. But those who decry the Gov
ernor's action must say. frankly, what other course was
legally possible. When a district has elected, Jo admin
ister the law, the members of an oath-bound organiza
tion that violates the law, and when those officers give
the weight of their authority to support such violation,
is there no power in the State to vindicate the law? If
there is not, then the mining regions of Colorado are
separated not only from the State but from the National
Government.
A secret organization is exercising therein the powers
of sovereignty. It is a sovereignty absolute and more
autocratic than any other on earth. It has no trial by
jury, no habeas corpus, in its system. The principles of
law and equity are unknown to it, and it arbitrarily de
cides who may work or who must starve, and who may
do business there and under what conditions. It exer
cises all of the functions of government and others which
no Government ever claimed.
It is no answer to say that it would secure peace to
the people on condition that every one in its novel
jurisdiction submitted to it, and all who did so would be
protected :n their life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.
When all that is conceded, it â¢ is conceded also that
i wherever men are strong enough to do the same they
i have the right to expel republican government, to deny
I the right of a minority to live at all, and to declare that
there is no such thing as a constitutional guarantee.
The Declaration of Independence says: "We hold
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with cer
tain inalienable rights; that amongst these are life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness; Â¦', that to secure these rights
governments are instituted amongst men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed." All
men have these rights, not the majority of men in any
certain district, but the minority as well. When the
majority claim them, but deny them to the minority,
there is defiance of the fundamental principle of civil lib
erty. When this occurred in Colorado and the denial
was accentuated by dynamite murder, what was the
proper course for the State? * r ;

5 HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. June 3. â Amer
ica is to see the play "Saturday to
Monday," which is now filling to over
flowing the St. James, London's most
fashionable theater, and which has
had a curious history. When it first
was produced the London critics with
one voice condemned it. They saw
nothing good in the play and nothing
;.:uo(3 in the acting', while the general
public wondered what it was all
about. There was, however, some ex
cuse. Although George Alexander
had had it for some. two years, "Sat

FOR nearly a year there has been much agitation
over the proceedings to exclude from this country
one Turner, an English anarchist. Organizations
have espoused his cause and have denounced the attempt
to exclude him as a denial of the right of free speech.
At last his case has reached the Supreme Court of the
United States, where a unanimous decision upholds the
immigration officers in sending: him back.
In answer to the argument that his deportation would
be a violation of the constitutional guaranty of freedom
of speech, the court says that the constitution was made
for the people. living in this country. Its guarantees of
personal liberty are for their protection, and no foreign
er seeking to enter the country in opposition to its laws
can claim any rights under the constitution at all. They

ppems to be in for a long run. Its
part author, Richard Pryce, has been
known to Americans for several years
as a promising writer of stories.
"Princess Poppae" was, Mr. Pryce
tells me, his first success at home.
This was followed by the rather ugly
story of "Miss Weatherby," but of late
years perhaps Pryce is best known as
the author of "Elementary Jane."
As his name suggests, Mr. Pryce is
a "Welshman. He was in the Bank of
England when he first began to write,
but after his American and British
recognition the time came when he
found he would have to give up either
his literary work or the bank. So he
left the bank. Now Mr. Pryce has
two other plays ready for production.
Mr. Frohman, putting in his usual
time on this side of the water, is, as
active as ever. London playgoers
have been anxious for some time to
see which of the London managers
would take over a new playhouse
which is being built in Shaftesbury
avenue and now it is announced that
the American Impresario will have it.
Mr. Frohman ran over to Paris a few
days ago and while there secured the
American rights in "The Third Moon,"
the Chinese comedy by the authoress
of "The Marriage of Kitty," which has
Just been produced at the Paris
Vaudeville.
Though no one here has had the
temerity to suggest it, probably the
reason why Alfred Austin didn't sign
his name to the curtain-raiser which he
recently submitted to Arthur Bourchier
was that he was afraid it might be re
fused. Doubtless Mr. Austin thought
that it would never do to allow a Lon
don manager to turn down the poet
laureate. But when Bourchier's official
"reader" came to the anonymous man
uscript of "A Lesson in Harmony" he
found it so promising that he at once
commended it to the actor-manager's
attention. He also asked Mr. Bourchier
to note a letter which accompanied the
playlet and in which the nameless dra
matist wrote: "Should this little piece
be accepted the author makes it a con
dition that Mr. Bourchier will himself
play the part."
Upon^ reading the piece Bourchier
liked It so much that he wrote, asking
the anonymous one to call, and was
electrified at the appointed hour to find
himself facing the poet laureate. It
was soon arranged between them, how
ever, that Mr. Austin's comedietta
should be produced as a curtain-raiser
to W. 8. Gilbert'* "The Fairy's Dilem
ma," which Is now the attraction at the
Garrick. Hitherto the poet laureate has
not enjoyed great success as a drama
tist. His "Rlodden Field" was given a
lavish production by Beerbohm Tree at
a special performance at His Majesty's,
but it was roasted by the critics and
Tree has never thought it best to put
It into the regular bill.
Hale was one of the stars on a local
morning paper. That is not his real
name, but it will do. He was a hard
worker, and a brilliant worker, but a
fondness for the cup that cheers oc
casionally led him astray. He never
"fell down," however, without giving
his chief notification of the Impending
disaster. This forethought and his
brilliant work between relapses insured
forgiveness for his sometimes Incon
venient slips from virtue's paths.
Like most of those of his erratic
class, Hale had passed out of local
Journalism, but the story of one of his
"storm warnings" is a still-alive tra

cannot assert the rights in general obtaining in a land to
which they do not belong as citizens or otherwise. The
right to exclude any or all classes of foreigners is in
herent in ' government for its own preservation. Our
immigration laws deny admission to every alien "who
disbelieves in or who is opposed to all organized govern
ment, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organ
ization entertaining or teaching such disbelief in or such
opposition to all organized government."
In Turner's behalf it was claimed that he is a philo
sophical anarchist. 1 By that we suppose is meant that
he would not himself use dynamite, or gun or dagger
in the overthrow of government by the murder of its
representatives. Yet he preaches the philosophy of
murder for the incitement of others to commit crimes.
A large number of people got off on the wrong foot
in the Turner case. Among them was Carl Schurz, who
in his old age seemed to see some analogy between his
own case and Turner's, where there was no analogy at
all. Schurz came here a revolutionary refugee who had
joined other Germans in the revolution of 1848, which
was hot for the destruction of all organized government,
but for the substitution of a more liberal for a less liberal
form of government. The philosophical anarchist is
against all government, of whatever form, and the prac
tical anarchist sees no difference between a republic and
an autocracy, and is ready to destroy them all.

Colonel Smith, in speaking of the af
fair, treated the matter very lightly.
He said:
"The little escapade and the visit of
the ladles to Angel Island was only a
matter of youthful indiscretion. Boys
will be boys, you know, and I do not
think that these two young men should
be too severely punished for these little
follies. You know we have all been
young once."
Now this Is all very well according
to Colonel Smith's statement, but the
wives of the' officers at Angel Island
take a very different view of the mat
ter. They did not like the invasion of
that camp by the kind of women the
lieutenants are said to have brought
there and they are very much opposed
to the orgies said to have taken place
on the Island since these officers have
been stationed there.
In the meantime General MacArthur
has taken no action In the premises.
Lieutenant Smith, being backed by a
father and grandfather in the army,
can bring influence to bear in his be
half. His father knows that in
the case of a court-martial there
is a possibility of his son only
being reprimanded, or at least
dropped a few files in the army. ! This
is what he fought for so strenuously
when he was here. If the young lieu
tenant's resignation was accepted that
would end his career so far as army
life is concerned. A court-martial is
really his only salvation.
The outcome of the cases of Lieu
tenant Charles F. Smith and Lieuten
and W. W. White is Just now a matter of
much speculation In army circles. The
resignations of both these officers were
handed to General MacArthur. At the
same time Colonel Allen Smith arrived
from the East and it is reported that
he begged General MacArthur tcr stay
the- proceedings so far as his son was
concerned and requested him that his
son be allowed to withdraw his resig
nation and let the case come up in the
regular manner before a court-mar
tial. Should this request be granted
Lieutenant White would also be al
lowed to withdraw his resignation and
face a court-martial, his offense being
similar.

MAY BE TRIED
MISS STEINMAN
IS WEDDED TO
AN EASTERN MAN
Judge Garber closed the case for the
company by citing a number of deci
sions relative to public corporations
and claiming that when water rates are
regulated property is taken for public
use He contended that the Council
had reached the conclusion whereby
the rates were fixed by overruling
Judge Hart, who had passed upon all
the questions involved. Mayor Olney
was roasted to a brown turn for hav
ing secured the services of Desmond
Fitzgerald to make a report on the
values of the company's property when
it was all practically guess work.
Contrary to the usual practice of the
court. Olney followed t Judge Garber
and raised the question of jurisdiction,
claiming that it must be shown that
the city had taken the company's prop
erty without due process of law, other
wise thÂ«Â» Federal court could not act.
Olney also started to go into the merits
of the case, but McEnerney objected.
The court allowed Olney to proceed
and later said the case would be taken
under advisement.
Mr. Davis argued that the company
knew the constitutional provision rela
tive to fixing rates when it went into
business. He thought the services ren
dered should govern the fixing of rates
and not the so-called value of the
property owned.
In/ the afternoon Mr. Fitzgerald took
up the argument for the city and In a
concise manner went through the mass
of figures and presented to the court
by his deductions the claim that the
company was in reality receiving a
revenue equivalent to 13 per cent- He
believed the object of applying for the
injunction was to tie up the people of
Oakland in order to collect money
which would never be paid back. Mr.
McEnerney asked if the rates had not
been cut 30 per cent. Mr. Fitzgerald
said they had been cut 25 per cent
gross, but added: "We have bought
you flowers, decorated your buildings,
buried your friends, bought you pa
pers, paid counsel fees and still you
say we are unfair."
COMPANY CLOSES ARGUMENT.
Attorney Davis for Oakland pleaded
against the injunction being issued. He
paid what the company a-Sked was in
realty to be allowed to charge rates
which would give them 5 per cent on
the bonds and then a rate over and
above thatâ or. in other words, pay
them for the privilege of using bor
rowed money. If the company contend
ed that the question was on the value
of the plant, items for decorations,
funerals, etc., should not have been
included in the operating expenses.
OAKLAND'S SIDE OF CASE,
The Council had allowed $50,000 for
taxes, but according to the assessment
of the company's property $175,000
would be necessary. McEnerney said
it was all well enough to greet with
plee the taxing of any large corpora
tion,, but the glee quickly turns to sor
row when the rate payer has to foot the
bill. He claimed the Council had made
a cut of 30 per cent in the rates and
that the property had been intention
ally underestimated. For four years the
Council has been trying to confiscate
the company's property, and the cut
ting down of the revenue was the prin
cipal way of doing it.
Authorities were quoted to show why
the injunction prayed for should issue.
It was shown that a bonded indebted
ness of $3,500,000 and a floating debt of
$500,000 existed. The former carries in
terest at 5 per *ent and the latter at 6
per cent. Between those items and op
erating expenses and taxes the com
pany will not derive one cent for its
use unless the injunction is granted
and until the case had beÂ«?n settled in
the State courts.
were being furnished water at a cheap
.er rate than the ordinance allowed to
be charged. The company admitted
that fact and said the Southern Pacific
was given a lower rate than others on
account of the quantity used.
Garret McEnerney opened the argu
ment for the company by stating the
grounds upon which the action had
been begun. He contended that the as
tion of the City Council was neither fai.
nor just. The basis which the Council
had taken for the purpose of fixing the
rates would only allow the company a
revenue of $459,002. Of that amount
one-eigrhih would have to be raised out
side of the city. The company claims
$>.0,000 per year for depreciation, and in
the answer Mayor Olney admitted that
the depreciation was about $40,000. but
the Council had only allowed $2750.

The necessity of a guardian other
than her father for 17-year-old Alice
Irene Warner was proved in the Su
perior Court yesterday and Judge Cof
fey appointed Gustave A. Hourcade to
take the father's place. The court re
quired Hourcade to furnish a bond in
the sum of $1000.
Matthew Thomas Warner was di
vorced from his wife March 18 and
subsequently was granted letters of
guardianship over the daughter, Alice,
who lived with him at the home of
John Winters. The mother, learning
that the child was mistreated, applied
to have Warners' guardianship re
voked and for her appointment in
stead. She alleged that the father did
not provide the girl with food, cloth
ing or needed medical attendance and
that she was compelled to work in a
candy store until midnight. On ac
count of the lateness of the hour at
which she returned home, Winters, it
was said, locked .her out for three
nights and she was compelled to seek
lodging In houses of questionable
reputation. Finally the girl, went to
room at the Zola House, a place of ill
repute, and the mother to get her out
had to cause her arrest. In the
petition Mrs. Warner said that the girl
was good at heart, but was in sore
need of a good guardian.
At the hearing yesterday the two
sisters and brother of Alice corrobo
rated the mother's statements and Of
ficers Fogarty and Young testified to
the evil reputation of the Zola House.
The child was willing to have her
mother as guardian, but the court de
cided that it would be best to have a
third party, who was a friend.
Warner resisted his removal and
testimony in his behalf was given by
Mrs. Birdie Winters and Mrs. Mae
Burke, who declared that the father
had been good to the girl and had
given her money. They intimated that
Alice was wayward and Mrs. Winters
declared that the girl on one occasion
called Mr. Winters a vile name.
Judge Coffey Appoints G. A. Hourcade
to Look After the. Welfare of
Alice Warner.

Drennairs Double Play In tlie Ninth
Blasts the Visitors' Hopes.
OAKLAND TXJSES TO PORTLAND?
PORTLAND. June 16.â The score
was 2 to 1 and Oakland was making
o gallant effort to win out in the ninth
when fate in the person of Kirby
Drennan chopped the game off short,
with the home team to the good. It
was an unasyiFted double that turned
the trick. Hrlck Devereaux sent the
ball hustling out over second. It looked
Kood enough for a hit, but when the
ppnere came down toward earth the
Portland center fielder's mitt closed
on it. Two strides to second and the
play was complete.
Clean. fast ball kept the fans on the
tiptoe of excitement all through the
frame. Roach was Invincible in the
box. Olily in the sixth were the visit
ors able to connect with his twisters.
Schmidt v.-as easier. Beck was given
credit for a single and two doubles
Jake Thielman warmed up to the Oak
lander's benders to the extent of a

Hermis, never touched by the whip,
simply threw defiance to the others in
the dust from his hammering hoofs,
and through the stretch he was not
even challegned. The Picket nosed
out Irish Lad for second . money.
Proper, Major Daingerfleld and Afri
cander brought up the rear.
Had the .winner been pressed he
woulcL have broken the record for tha
tÂ»ack "Â« with ease. When the great
crowd realized the splendid exhibition
of equine worth shown by the victor
it arose 'en masse and , cheered him
wildly, despite the fact that the book
makers had accepted and won nearly
$500,000 on the defeat of Irish Lad.
Hermis was heavily backed, however,
and at least one-quarter of the amount
taken in on the defeat of the favorite
was paid out on the winner. Sum

named. ' . ,
The field was lined up and sent away
in perfect order by Starter Fitzgerald.
Hermis, from the outside position,
shot to the front as if hurled from a
catapult. Passing the judges' stand,
he had secured the coveted place on the
rail, with Irish Lad and The Picket
close behind. The others did not ap
pear in the same class. On the racers
sped, around the turn and down the
back stretch, never changing position
for an instant. Irish Lad challenged
again and agaln.v but to no purpose.
He crept up on the flying leader re
peatedly, but was unable to hold the
terrific pace, much less overhaul him
The Picket, the_ hope of the Western
and Southern contingent, ran along
unconcernedly in third place untilthe
mile post had been reached.' Then he
drew up an dcrept past the Duryea
horse inch by inch.
HERMIS IS CHALLENGED.
Irih Lad was installed favorite for
the Suburban at 6 to 5: 4 and 5 could
be had against Hermis, 5 against The
Picket and the same against
while Africander and Major Dainger
field were without friends at 40 or
50 to 1. The pressure of offerings on
Irish Lad was so heavy that/9 to 10
waa asked when tho contestants were
called to the post.
NEW YORK June 16.â Hermis, own
ed by Edward R. Thomas, won
the Suburban handicap cleverly to
day at Pheepshead Bay. The son of
Hermence was on his toes when the
barrier snapped. He crossed in front
of the six competitors from the out
side and passed the Judges' stand in
the lead on his Journey of one and a
quarter miles. From the position of
command thus secured on the rail he
was never headed, and won, under a
perfect ride by Arthur Redfern, in the
time of 2:05 â the best on record for the
Suburban and two-fifths of a second
slower than the track record of 2:04 3-:>,
held by McChcsney. Irish L.ad, the
public favorite,' failed entirely to jus
tify the confidence of his backers, and
finished third, nosed out of second
honors by The Picket.
A great crowd journeyed to the Long
Island racecourse to view the twenty
first running of the $20,000 classic. Per
fect racing weather prevailed, and
more than 30,000 persons had passed
through the gates before the hour set
for the first race. The crowd grev
rapidly until every available point of
vantage had been taken, and even the
Infield waa dotted with enthusiasts.

TACOMA. June 16.â Tacoma let the
visitors have one lonely tally just as a
present. Keefe's masterly pitching en
titled him to a shut-out. However,
in thÂ« third, errors by Sheehan and
KÂ»gan, coupled with Hildebrand's
timely single, secured Knell. The lat
ter was eapy for tno Tigers, who picked
many choice hits off his delivery. Nor
dyke and Graham led the batters, but
Home-run Eagan could not solve the
puzzle.
Tacoma's fielding was good, while at
times Kn <i !I'f support was yellow.
However, a fast triple play in the third
puli^ him out of a tight hole. With

to Miller, killing Nr.rdyk<?. Eagan was

at 11 to 1, was a good second, with
Glassful an easy third. The stake was
worth $2870 to the winner. Horatius is
owned by Frank Skinner, the Califor

ful went to the post a favorite at 4 to 1.
Instead of going to the front, he lay
back until the stretch was reached,
and at the eighth pole looked like a
keen contender. He could not stall off
Horatius' rush, and Fonsoluca also out
gamed the Dunne trick for the place.
Horatius ran a smashing race. Last
passing the stand he took the outside,
where he would be free from interfer
ence, and ran around his field. He
closed with a wild rush in the last
eighth and won going avfc-ay. .

SEATTLE, June 16.â Los Angeles
jilayed a briliant game to-day and,
favored a trifle by Umpire Jim Mc-
Donald at a critical point, won the
Fame by a score of 5 to 4. In reality
the game should have beeu a tie at
the end of the ninth. Delchanty beat
â¢ â¢'it a bit to deep short, but McDonald
did not see it that way and came in for
a resting at the hands of the crowd.
iJclehanty wanted, to make a vigorous
protest, but decided that discretion
was the better part of valor in this
j'Hrticular case.
The Angels cutbatted Seattle, which
iÂ« quite a feat in these day?. They se
cured ten hits with a .total of eleven
bases. Cravath bumped the ball*
apainFt the l*-ft f.eld fence again, but
R<>t only two bases. â¢ .; ,
Uaum pitched a clever game, having
muih th<* better of Jay Hughes for
live innings. He gave Toman and
K!oÂ«;d plenty of work, also took a few
chances himself. Iloss made a sensa
tional running catch of a long fly foul.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS
Reports from Harbin Springs last
night were to the effect that there was
little change In Jeffries' condition. Dr.
Devening spent Wednesday night at
the springs in order to be on hand
early yesterday morning. The Injured
knee still has to be bandaged^ every
hour throughout the night. Kid Egan
and Jack Jeffries have been faithful
nurses and think they will be qualified
to receive diplomas if their case lasts
much longer.
Andy Gallagher and the miner tried
infighting and did some fast work at
this branch of the game. He took his
usual dip in the ocean.
His work yesterday was half-hearted,
as It has been since the fight was post
poned. He punched the bag a little
and then boxed a round each vtith his
staff of six sparring partners. Zurirk.
a lightweight, was a newcomer. Mc-
Donald. Long and Sullivan came In for
some hard knocks.
The fate of the proposed Jeffrles-
Munroe championship fight will be set
tled within the next twenty-four hours.
Manager Coffroth. representing the
Yosemite Club, determined to visit
Harbin Springs and note for his own
satisfaction the condition of Jeffries.
Harry Pollock, who represents Munroe
In all business matters, had a consul
tation with the big miner yesterday
and It was decided that Pollock *,vou!d
go up to Jeffries' quarters to-day with
Manager Coffroth.
The situation will be thoroughly can
vassed and a definite announcement
will be made. Munroe and his people
are chafing under the present condi
tions, as he has many offers from thÂ»
East. He Is a much greater drawing
card than when he came West, owing
to the widespread advertising he haa
received. "

HortiÂ«tural Commissioner Elwood
Cooper Is causing to be prepared a
book of unique interest and value to all '
fruit growers of California, and, inci- I
dentally, to many business interests in,'
this State that are connected with the !
prowing, preserving, canning and mar- \
ketlng of fruits.
The contents will consist of informs- \
tion of the ready-for-use sort about:
poales. the beneficial parasites that :
rrey upon the scales infesting at one !
time or another the orchards of Cali- j
fornia, and the text will be illustrated
vlth illuminated cuts that will accu
rately represent the damaging scales '
that cause the ruin of trees and crops
v hen their pernicious industry is per- j
mftted to remain unchecked.
By means of the pictures every at
tentive observer who has to do with the
< are or ownership of fruit trees will be
a ble to identify each and every variety
of scale that has yet appeared in Cali
fornia, and the text will give informa
tion concerning the beneficial parasite
ihat has been found to devour any par
ticular sort of scale.
DIAGNOSIS EASY'.
In brief, the book, with cuts and text, |
v ill be a means in the hands of inter- ;
< s ted persons to enable them to make
at once their own diagnosis of any det- Â¦
rSmental growth that is found In the!
orchards, if such has ever previously !
appeared in the State, and will also tell j
exactly what parasite is adapted to the j
emergency.
Many scales that were once the source ;
<>f large losses have been kept in check !
by the beneficial parasites that have ]
Wen introduced from foreign lands, '
l-ittle is being paid about them because
tbefr menace was put aside. Some of
them rcay have been forgotten, or they;
may be new to fruit growers in isolated
localities. No scale has ever been com- ,
pletely annihilated by the parasites. In- J
deed, if complete destruction of any
variety of scale could be accomplished
it would be a misfortune in all proba
bility, r.
The beneficial parasites will feed on Â¦,
only one sort of scale. As long as there |
axe a few scales remaining, the food
for the parasites sufficient to keep a â¢
few alive remains.
STARVING PARASITES.
If there were no food of the particu- :
Tar sort required by each sort of bene- !
ficlal narasite, then the parasite would
starve.
If then, the scale should reappear at;
any time it would be necessary to go :
all over the ground of arming anew j
apainst it. and time would elapse in
crfalch considerable damage might be j
done.
PICTURES ARK ACCURATE.
The cuts that are in preparation for
the forthcoming bonk have been ap- j
proved by Alexander Craw, whose
knowledge of scales and parasites is J
based unnn many years of experience, i
during whk h he has labored to find
and exterminate one and to cultivate !
the other.
A sufficient number of copies of the
book will come from the State Printing j
Office to supply those who are in need ,
<tf them. The knowledge contained in j
them ought to constitute every reader j
an assistant in some degree of the -
â¢State's officer to quarantine fruit tree j
rest*, by eriving ready information con- j
f-erningr what is happening in the or
chards in all parts of the State.
The prosecution sought to prove
through the witness, Williams, that at
the time Eppinger borrowed money
from the International Banking Corpo
ration the lots of wheat on which the
money was loaned were not In the
warehouse, and had not been there for
months. The prosecution is also seek
ing to show that money had been bor
rowed on more wheat than the ware
house contained. An a foundation for
this the witness was called upon trÂ»
show Just what lots of wheat were in
the warehouse and how much was good.
His testimony was startling, inasmuch
as he swore that certain piles of sacks
which were supposed to be filled with
first quality wheat contained nothing
but screenings or the sweepings of the
warehouse floors. At the hour of ad
journment he had not finished reading
from his list. The case will be contin
ued this morning. -.
Robert Williams, who for BomÂ» time
was employed In the Pacific "Warehouse
Company's warehouses at Crockett, oc
cupied the stand for the greater part
of the day yesterday irMhe proceedings
against Jacob Eppinger, charged with
obtaining money under false pretenses.
Through Williams the prosecution was
able to bring before the court testi
mony regarding the contents of the
warehouses at Crockett and to have the
diagrams made by Officer Russell ad
mitted in evidence) His testimony was
rather damaging to the defense.
The examination of Williams caused
another of the long wrangles over the
admissibillty of testimony which have
characterized the case since it was first
called. During the afternoon Attorney
Ach for the defense stated that he was
as anxious to see the case finished as
soon as possible.
The court.- In- pursuance of the powers vest
Â»>rj in it, orders that the certificate of Albert
Lockett at roaster lr*ued by the Minister of
Marine and Fisheries for the pomlnlon of
Canada be suspended for the period of three
calendar months from '''this date, but recom
mends that a certificate as mate be issued to
him In tbe meantime. -
The court desires especially to call the
attention of the Board of Trade to the fact
that the sailing- directions are not explicit
enough as to the currents running in the har
bor of San Francisco and off the heads, and
that â¢ vessels - rounding Bonita Point are not
compelled to give warning of their approach
by sounding their ' whistles, a precaution
which, assuming that the report of the mas
ter of tbe Algoa had been sustained in every
particular, would, â¢ in all probability. havÂ»
avoided the disaster.
That the master, Albert Iyjckett, committed
a serious error of Judgment In having star
boarded, in having not laid to for a pilot, or
â¢topped w anchored for a time in the channel
rather than make a dangerous maneuver.
That the Â¦ master, Albert Lockett. did all
that was possible after the disaster to pro
tect the Interests of all concerned and acted
in a proper and seamanllke manner.
FAULT THE CAPTAIN'S.
That the crew behaved in a proper manner;,
that discipline was good, and the disaster
cannot bÂ« attributed to any shortcomings on
the part of the crew or any one of them.
That Henry Nelson, first mate, Charles L.
Patterson, second mate, and W. M. Lloyd, the
thjrd mate, acted In a seamanllke and proper
manner, and that the court sees no ground
whatever for blaming the conduct of any one
of them.
That there was nothing brought out in evi
dence of any charge whatever against the sec
ond or third 'mate.
That the letting ro of the anchor by the chief
officer without Instructions was Justifiable In
view of the fact that the vessel was going
ashore, and they are of the opinion that the
letting go of the port anchor was not the
cause of the stranding and did not contribute
to it.
That the evidence as to the channel being ob
ttructed by a tug with a sailing vessel in tow
Is (ontradktory, the evidence of the pi
lots called being much at variance with that
givtn hy the officer!* and crew of the vessel.
That tueh at this discrepancy is explained by
the fact that the pilots saw the vessel from
an awkward angle and were net in fo pood a
position as those on board the Algoa. to swear
that the channel was or was not obstructed
by the tug and sailing vessel passing out t>y
the Fouth channel. The court, however. In
clines to the belief that the channel was not
obstructed, at any rate to any great extent,
an.l attributes the loss of the ves.Â«wl to the
matter having starboarded ' in a strong eddy
CVmt setting Inshore. They are of the opin
ion that it would have been more prudent for
the mo*ter to lay to for a pilot outside No. 2
buoy, or even to stop or anchor In the channel
for a short time when he thought there was
danger of collision rather than to have made
the starboard movement.
EVIDENCE CONTRADICTORY.
That during; the forenoon 'watch she Â»es off
the San Francisco heads and entered the Bonita
Channel without a pilot, but signals up for
one. That there wa* nothing in the nailing
directions cr the local pilotage directions in
regard to rtrons and variable Currents prevail
ing In the Bonita Channel, and that In at
tempting to starboard the Algoa was seized by
a strong current, which tended to drive her
on the land, in spite of the starboard anchor,
which had been let go to cant her head out
and that tne chief mate, seeing that the star
board anchor had been carried away and that
hrr position was desperate, let go port anchor
without Instruction*, and serious damage wag
done >>oth to chip and cargo.
That proi>er measures were taken to float the
vessel and the was subsequently brought safely
into iiort. ' *
That all went well on the voyage up to the
7th inet.. when s>he entered Ilonita Channel,
and that her course up to thon had been well
and truly iaid. .. ' J '
Lockett was much perturbed by the
verdict of the court. He shook hands
glumly with Consul Bennett, remark
ing that if the facts had been devel
oped he would still retain his license
as master. The suspended license was
issued by the Minister of Marine and
Fisheries of Canada and has been In
effect since 1894. The findings of the
court in ful! were as follows:
It appear? from the evidence given before
this court that she nailed from Yokohama on
or about May "(>. 11K'4. bound for San Fran
cisco with a senerai cargo and a crew of sixty-
Fix hands, all told.
Among shipping men the verdict of
the court of inquiry was fully indorsed.
It was freely stated that Lockett tcrok
an unreasonable risk for the purpose of
avoiding pilot fees. His mistake will
probably prove fatal to his future as
jiirations. as the Algoa belongs to the
Pacific Mail line, a company which
never forgets or forgives a mistake
upcrn the part of its executive offi
cers.
Albert Lockett, once master of the
Pacific Mall Company's freighter Al
goa, was deprived of his license yes
terday by a court of inquiry, the sus
pension to last three months. The Al
goa went on the rocks in Point Bonita
channel last Tuesday week and dam
age to her hull and cargo was inflicted
to the extent of more than $50,000. Sub
sequently she was floated and brought
Into port without further loss of prop
erty and with no loss of life.
The Algoa being under the British
flag, a British court of inquiry heard
the testimony and rendered the ver
dict. The court was composed of
Courtenay W. Bennett, C. I. E., the
British Consul at this port. Captain
Wood of the British ship Iquique and
Captain Armstrong of the Coptic, be
longing to the White Star line.
Lockett was called again to the wit
ness stand yesterday and reiterated his
statements of the day before regard
ing the occurrences leading up to the
Algoa's going on the rocks. The hear
ing was in open session and at the
beginning Consul Bennett ttrld Lockett
thuc it was the unanimous opinion of
the court that he was responsible for
the disaster. In his testimony Lockett
tried to throw the blame for the dam
age to his vessel upon his first mate,
Henry Nelson, who let go the port
anchor after the starboard anchor had
been carried away. Nelson was re
called and explained satisfactorily his
action without orders from the cap
tain. The verdict fully vindicated him
and all the crew.
VERDICT IS INDORSED.
They claim, however, that the com
pany lost customers through its own
acts, in that it did not furnish pure
milk or cream, but adulterated Its milk
with skimmed milk and water and
colored it with burnt sugar, and adul
terated Its cream with lime water. The
defendants deny that they have dam
aged the plaintiff in the sum of $10,000.
They deny that they have been sell
ing milk since April 1, as alleged, and
deny that thev diverted any customers
from the company or that the company
lest any customers through the wrong
ful acts of the defendants.
ADULTERATED MILK.
It is declared by the dairymen that
they were induced to enter into the
agreement by false and fraudulent
statements made to them by the com
pany's agents. They were informed,
they say, that the company was form
ing a milk trust: that it had bought up
all the milk plants and business in San
Francisco, and unless the Salomons
would sell the company would "cut
prices and drive them out of business.
The company guaranteed that the 300
shares of its stock were worth $3000
and would pay 8 per cent profit. The
dairymen declare that the statements
were all false and were made for the
purpose of intimidating and influencing
them, and in fear that they would be
driven out of business they entered into
the agreement and became the com
pany's agents. Upon discovering that
the company had not bought all the
milk plants and that its stock would
not earn 8 j*r cent, the defendants say,
they rescinded the sale and tendered
back the consideration. .
The defendants deny all of the cor
poration's charges, and aver that on
February 21, 1903, they agreed to sell
the Merced dairy for $4918 and 300
shaies of stock in the United Milk Com
pany. The cash was to be paid In two
installments of $2418 and $2500.
FALSE STATEMENTS.
The United Milk Company is charged
with intimidation, fraudulent repre
sentation and supplying adulterated
milk in various clauses o{ the answer
filed in the Superior Court yesterday
by M. Salomon & Sons to the suit of
the milk combine for $10,000 damages.
In its complaint the milk company
alleged that the Salomons hftd sold to
it the Merced dairy and agreed not to
engage again in the milk business in
San Francisco except as the company's
agents. The Salomons, it was said, did
not live up to the agreement, and, fur
thermore, diverted more than 160 of the
company's customers. This constituted
the damages alleged. (

WITNESS THE WONDERFUL DEMON-
STRATIONS of the NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
For a reliable and intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE, 428 Eddy st.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not menrion all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
wltH the facts In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you. find the cause of trouble and
t-uirgest the remedy.
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as ha is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
Would it not be a relief to know how 70U
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters that
are troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.'

A Xcrvy Youngster.
A boy about 9 years old was pedaling
vigorously out Chestnut j street the
other day on his bicycle, but on the
â¢wrong side of the street. He was
therefore inviting the accident which
soon overtook him. A big automobile
came whizzing down in the opposite
direction and struck the kid and
his wheel amidships, sending both fly
ing in the air. The rider turned sev
eral somersaults in midair, while the
bystanders cried out in horror, expect
ing him to be killed instantly. But
this youth, cat like, landed on his
feet. He immediately, drew a pencil
and piece of paper from his pocket and
rushing uo to the chauffeur demanded
his name and address. The man
laughed.
"I must have it," insisted the boy.
"Are you hurt?" asked the man.
"Naw, I ain't hurt, but I want your
name. Give up now."
* The automobilist thereupon drew his
card from his pocket and handed it
to the boy.
"You were on the wrong side of the
street, my little man," he said, "but
never mind that. I like your nerve.
Get your wheel fixed and bring the bill
to me." And ' away he went. â Phila

mands considerable knowledge and Â¦
skill in capture." Tiger snakes are the
best, for they carry most venom.
Snakes are still numerous in the Aus
tralian bush.

prices of white, had a further advance. The
receipts were more liberal than on the preced

little stock being left in first hands at the
close. Onions were plentiful and prices were
without quotable variance.
Vegetables ' arrived freely and prices of Sev
eral kinds were lowerV Peas and Asparagus
were scarce and firm, surplus stocks of tho
former being taken by the canners at 4H^Sc
per pound. Common field Peas are no longer
worth quoting, as there are very few coming
in and they are poor. Tomatoes continued to
declino under continued heavy receipts and

NEW TORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK, June 16.â Speculative senti
ment continued much unsettled to-day on the
proposed preferred vtock i&sue of the Bouth-
I era Pacific. The feverith tone of Union Pa
cific and Southern Pacific in the early dealings
kept traders out of the general market, and
those two stocks almost monopolized the trad
ing. When they settled down to about last
right's level the rest of the market took on a
bbttcr tone anil was inclined to advance
! Biowly on light transactions. Opinions were
j rreatly nAx,âl over the relative benefits cr
i burdens to Union Pacinc and Southern Paciflc
j preferred etock issue. Union Pacific's double
role of stockholder and creditor of Southern
Pacific is the principal cause of confusion. As
creditor Its advances to the subsidiary com
pany are to be paid oft* by a portion of the
r.ew preferred stock and by the proceeds of
the subscription. As stockholder the claims
of Scuthern Pacific ctock upon earnings arÂ« to
be supereeded by the 1 per cent rights of the
new- preferred stock. Union Paciflc was
scir.evhat erratic in the early dealings, in
accordance with these uncertainties regarding
bentfits to accrue.' The stook eold TÂ» under â¢ last
'night at one time. There was less contrariety
of opinion on the plans of Southern Pacific
and traders wpre Inclined to sell that stock.
The buying was attributed to supporting
xr.easure3 by insiders and was effective la
checkinr the decline and Inducing some cov
ering in the stock. The value of the subscrip

GEORGE H. WILLtfON, Local Forecaster.
CHICAGO. June 16.â Lower cables, liberal
receipts in the Northwest and generally favor
able weather caused an easier tone in wheat
at the start initial quotations on July being
down %c to %c at 84%@S4"ic Shortly after
thÂ« opening a good deal of long wheat for
September delivery was sold for account of a
defunct firm. who*e failure was announced last
night. - As a result the market for that option
was quite weak. As soon as the pressure on
September was removed . sentiment became
much firmer. Foreign crop news was bullish.
The drought in Roumanla was still unrelieved
and a report of the Russian Secretary of Agri
culture claimed that cold weather and drought
had caused serious damage to crops, especially
winter wheat. The news from Russia, how
ever, was practically the only .bullish news
received during the day. The predominance of
advices of a bearish character' soon caused a
reversal of sentiment," resulting In a gradual
decline. Selling developed on a reported In
crease of about 10 per cent In the Canadian
acreage and excellent ! weather conditions In
the Northwest. From S5Uc July steadily re
ceded to S4c. The close was at 84$ic. Sep
tember closed at 78 Sic,' â¢
Small receipts and estimated arrivals to
morrow were Influences that held corn firm,
notwithstanding the weakness of wheat. The
market closed at about yesterday's final
figures. July opened unchanged to }Jc lower
at 4**i1?49c and closed at 4$3Â£64S%c.
Smallness of receipts in comparison with
yesterday's estimate *nad a strengthening In
fluence on the oat " market. July opened at
3!)-H.c to 39V(.c, closing at 39%c.
Provisions were active and strong on an
urgent demand from shorts. Small receipts, of
hogs was one of the main factors in the situa
tion. Realizing by packers was a feature of
trading. The market closed well toward the
top, with September pork up 22%c at $12 87%:
September lard was up,. 10c at $7. and ribs
were 10(Â§12%c higher at $7 45g" 47%.

CASH WHEAT,
Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The foreign maricets showed little
change. The Russian Minister of Agricuture
officially reports serious crop damage by
drought and cold weather and says that the
general crop Is below thÂ« average.
Chicago was lower, with the longs disgusted
and unloading their Wheat.
The Chicago Trade Bulletin nays the aggre
gate supplies of breadstuff's credited to Europe
in all positions on June 1 were 26.340.000
bushels more than reported on June . 1, 11*03.
and 17,S90,000 more than on June 1, 1902.
Some authorities estimate a reduction of 100,
000,000 to 120.000,000 bushels in the WhÂ«at
crop of Europe. There is little doubt that
Rufslan, Argentine and Australian shipments
will tÂ» sin to diminish soon and It Is consid
ered that then the absence of American sup
plies will be strongly felt. The crop In the
United States will not be much over 600.000,000
bushels, which, with the light carry-over and
the Increased home consumption, will allow
barely 100,000,000 bushels for export.
In this market there was heavy selling of
December by an active operator who was put
ting out a short line, and the sales on the
morning session alone were about 7000 tons.
The sentiment was bearish and the tendency
was downward. The cash Wheat was easy,
but unchanged.
Reports of decreased output of Honey this
year are multiplying and the market Is show-
Ing more tone. The Ventura Democrat says:
"For the llrst time In the history of "Ventura
County the Honey crop this season is an entire
failure, and that characterization applies to
every eounjy south of the TehachapL In fact,
well-informed bee men assect that the whole
of Southern California will not produce for ex
port scarcely a carload of Honey. About all
the bee-raisers in this section are feeding thetr
bee9 to keep them alive, and there is not much
hope of betterment In the situation until tbÂ«
flowers bloom again with another year."

The market was liberally supplies with de
ciduous fruits and trade was. chiefly local, but
there was sufficient demand for export to hold
prices of green shipping Â«tock steady. Fine
lots of Apricots. Plums, well-colored Peaches
and Cherries," suitably packed for shipping.
were well cared for at good figures. Loose
Cherries ruled firm under moderate receipts
and a steady demand, and the market was
well cleaced up at the close. Currants were
firm at $6@7 per chest during the early trade,
as the narrow gauge train with fresh sup
plies was delayed, but price* receded later in
the day upon the arrival of 'the belated train,
and quite a few chests had to be carried over.
Longworth Strawberries and Raspberries and
Blackberries in crates were weak and lower,

good request and some were quoted higher.

fruits. Oranges sold at 'a wide range as to

this- decrease is largely offset oy free and . In

remains about the same. The feeling In ranch
Eggs continues easy and those' dealers who are
locking for a decline are letting their goods
go at \-iti lc below the top quotation. Others are
still boldfng at 23e. though the latter figure is
more extreme than it has be*n. Store Eggs
are meeting with less demand, aa buyers are
taking the Eastern In preference.
Rather mcra steadiness in tne finer grades *of
Cheese is reported, and shipments to the Orient
are Increasing somewhat. Receipts, too, are
lighter, and there is much less congestion than
for several months past. In regard to the de
crease in production due to the establishment
of condensed milk and evaporated cream plants
at different points the trade say that producers
are finding better returns by delivering their
milk to these factories than by making it Into
Cheese, hence thm new business will tend to
reduce the production of Cheese from now on,
though the effect on the output Is thus far
small.

He let no one know that his heart
was broken, but set about quietly U> ar

the world. He wrote a touching letter to
his younger brother. Robert Aspden.
and left all he. had to his father. To
Coroner Leland he addressed a letter
that Jested with death, and named the
cause as "temporary Insanity."
A note sent to Miss Hadenfeldt the
night before he died hinted at his in

A search was made for him, but when
found he lay under a tree in the park
with a bullet In his heart.
The following missive from Miss Ha

Dear George: I have thought over all that
has happened and have come to this conclusion.
I am going to do my work and only that. I
shall pay all my debt! and feel honorable. 1
hope, when that Is done. Of other matters 1
will not talk. I am mentally In no condition,
and If I km to do my work I must have rest.
I shall a*k you not to give up your position,
for I shall send you one-half of each weeks
salary after expenses are paid, and this money,
with your own salary, should give you enough
to work with, to further your own ambitions.
I hope Mr Brady will look at that play.
Mr. Bert said they would with pleasure. Do
your work and I will do mine, and there will
be. no great lose. Anyhow, the future will hold
wonders In store, so do not give up. but hold
to your hopes and desires. As I feel now. my
work Is uppermost and I feel I ought to do it
and not have any regrets In the future. There
has been so much expended that I feel it Is not
right to leave it unfinished. I hope you are
stronger to-day. My cold Is somewhat better.
Sincerely, JOAX.

trician, who can satisfactorily manage all.

JOKES WITH CORONER.
The following letter was written by
Aspden to. the Coroner:
June 13, 1301.
Dr. Leland. Coroner San Francisco â
Dear Sir: As one may not take even one â¢
own life without rendering account unto the
law I leave you this explanation of my deed.
I know It wQl be as much of a bore to you a*
It li to me. but ITTs" the traditional theory that
one might as well be dead as out of fashion.
For the benefit of your esteemed Jurors, and
In order that they may get home to dinner of
to their several and various pursuits as socn aa
possible after being dragged forth to sit on mÂ«
â for which. Inconvenience I am sure I beg
their collective pardons (you yourself are paid
for this sort of thing)â let us all agree that it
was due to "despondency over a long Illness."
or wouldn't "temporary Insanity" perhaps do
better? Yes. let's agree that It was "tempo
rary Insanity." That ought to Â»atl!ify the law.
even If It doesn't please the curious. The real
causeâ If there should happen to be the usual
suspicion that there is another reasonâ is no
one's affair but my own. I nhall consider It an
impertinent and a gross and ungentlemanly
breach- of the faith that I am reposing In you
all If you should cause trouble or sorrow to
any one who knew me In life by attempting to
probe deeper. I can assure you. but never
mindâ we have already agreed on â¢'temporary
Insanity," whose â doesn't matter, either.
If life were only as simple as death and as
attractive. . what a bright old world It would
be. Respectfully. GEORGE H. ASPDEN.
This pathetic missive waa left for
Robert Aspden. the younger brother of
the Journalist:
Dear Old Dobbin: We've lived a itranre

In the way of allegations of cruelty,
Madge Landmesser offered something
new yesterday when she sued her hus
band, Fred L. Landmesser, for divorce.
She Eays that they were married In
2~alt Lake in November. 1900, and have
an adopted child two years old. Ac
cording to the complaint, he failed to
support her and she had to take em
ployment as a domestic at the Strath
more Hotel. After cursing her and
striking her on various specified occa
sions, his cruelty is said to have cul
minated on June 12, at 307 Golden Gate
avenue, when he choked her and
pounded her head on the floor. She
avers that "Just as she was losing
consciousness and dying" neighbors,
who had heard her screams, burst into
the room and dragged him off. Then
in a half dazed condition she "fled in
terror into the street." She says that
the Monday before the assault he bor
rowed her last $7. She declares that
unless the court restrains him, or there
is intervention from the police, he will
carry out his threat to kill her.
Annie E. Christesen, wife of the pro-,
prietor of The Branch coffee-house,
tiled an answer and cross-complaint
itf his suit for diverce yesterday. In the
answer she denies all of his allegations
of ill-treatment and in the cross-com
plaint says that he has an income of
$1000 a month. She asks for $250 ali
mony and $1000 for counsel fees.

Gussie D. Phelan, wife of Ed. N. P.
Phelan, a bookkeeper, yesterday sued
him for divorce on the ground of ex
treme cruelty. They were married in
1S93 and have a daughter nine years
old. She alleges that he has cursed
her, struck her and spends his nights
in profligate living. On Thanksgiving
day, 1903. she avers, he threw her out
of their bxrme and locked the door.

Bereft of Love He Chooses
Death to Life of Bitter
Memories ' and Sad Days
"You do your work â I'll do mine. I
must live my own life.' JOAX."
With these words ringing in his ears,
George Aspden, a well-known young
newspaper man, held a pistol to his
breast early yesterday morning and
pressed the trigger. .In the gray light
of dawn, in a lonely part of Golden
Gate Park, a life fullof industry and
ambition terminated voluntarily. Proud,
sensitive, of a disposition that chafed
under a sense of wrong, the young man
decided to let death end all.
Before he killed himself Aspden
evidently reviewed his hopes and grief3
in the solitude of his own mind, and
when he entered the flower-scented
park he had already fully made hia
decision. He had placed all his hopes
on a woman's love, and she, dazzled by
the calcium light of the stage, had
chosen the possibilities of a career and
bade him go hJs way- alone.
DECISION' LJEADS TO DEATH.
Joan Hadenfeldt's decision took all
the joy from George Aspden's life. He
had done much for her. In fact, it was
his energy and his intellfgence that
enabled her to enter her chosen pro
fession. He arranged a play for her
and neglected his own work to make
it a success. The slight theatrical fame
she earned at the Orpheum only sharp
ened her appetite, for more. She went
East and found it. Then she decided
that she could and would climb to the
heights â alone. â¢ Her engagement to
marry George Aspden hindered her
ascent, she said. And he had staked
his life on the decision.
She told him she had decided to give
her whole life to her work. He heard
her as bravely as Kipling's Dick Held
lar. Not a reproach did he utter. Man
through and through, he accepted his
Restaurant 3Ian ? s Wife Asks
for Big Alimony and Fees.

TEIES TO HIDE CAUSE
To Settle Scobie Estate.
George Bennett and Alfred Black
are ready to wind up the affairs of the
estate of John Scobic, who died Feb
ruary 23, 1902. Yesterday they filed
their final account as administrators
and asked that the remainder of the
estate be distributed. The residue con
sists of $21,925 In cash and parcels of
real estate, including the home at 874
Fell street; property on Fell, Steven
son and Mission streets; on the Rus
sian River and at Guerneville.
The final account shows receipts of
$196,313 58 and disbursements amount
ing to $174,388. The widow, Agnes
Annie Scobie, has been paid $13,000
in cash and $116,550 in real estate.
The report accompanying the account
shows the payment of $135,000 In
legacies, chief of which was $65,000
to Marguerite Scobie Davis; $20,000 to
George Bennet. trustee, and $15,000
to John Law-son and William Scobie of
Blackford, Perthshire, Scotland, as
trustees.
Prior to its acquittal of Ben Louder
dale, accused of selling liquor with
out a license in the Turtle saloon, at
Geary and Powell streets, a Jury in
Judge Cabaniss' court was treated Â¦ to
some oral jousting by the lawyers in
the case. Mr. Hanley prosecuted, Mr.
Crowley defended and Policeman Ho
gan was the complainant. After Ho
gan had testified that Louderdale sold
him a drink of whisky Louderdale
was asked by Mr. Hanley if he and
Hogan had discussed the case after
the arrest.
Witness â "Yes, I spoke to him
about it while we were coming down
the street."
Mr. Crowley (to Mr. Hanley) â
"Why don't you tell him to say he
talked to the complainant at the Tur
tle?"
Mr. Hanley (to Mr. Crowley) â
"Why don't you go ahead and try the
case?" â¢
Mr. Crowley (to Mr. Hanley) â "I
will try my side of the case without
dictation from you."
Mr. Hanley (to Mr. Crowley) â "It's
a good thing for you there's a gas col
lector on the jury."
Mr. Crowley (ignoring Mr. Hanley
and addressing the witness, who
seemed to be deeply immersed in
thought) â "Did you sell this com
plainant a glass of liquor? Mr. Lou
derdale, do you hear me â are you
awake?"
Judge Cabaniss (to Mr. Crowley and
alluding to Mr. Louderdale) â "May
be his conscience is awake and delays
his answer."
Mr. Hanley (to himself) â "Ha! ha!
ha!"
Mr. Crowley (to the celling) â
"Don't argue with me. (To the jury):
It is surprising the number of lawyers
who don't know the law. Mr. Han
ley, for instance."
Mr. Hanley (to the Jury) â "Or Mr.
Crowjey. Don't pay any attention to
his hot air."
Mr. Crowley (to the Judge) â "I ob
ject to Mr. Hanley's use of the term
â¢hot air.' "
The Judge (to both attorneys)-râ
"Gentlemen, try to proceed in an or
derly way."
Among the witnesses was the secre
tary of the Police Commission, who
testified that the Turtle has been
without license to sell liquor for sev
eral months, but is running wide open
within the shadow of the lordly St.
Francis Hotel.
Half a dozen housewives told Judge
Mogan of . how they had. been taken
in and done for by Alfred Sllverstein's
phottrgraph-enlarging enterprise at 116
McAllister street.
Each of the ladies testified that she
was first visited by an^gent who in
duced her to lend him a photograph
by promising to have it enlarged to
Iifesize and to present her with the
magnified copy, stating that his only
compensation would be the advertise
ment of his business by her display of
the picture. A week' or so later another
agent called upon her with a proof of
the enlarged portrait and a lot of
samples of frames and he induced her
to sign a contract for a frame for the
picture and to pay a Jl or $2 deposit
on Its price, which ranged upward
from $3. That was the last she heard
of the matter until she visited the Mc-
Allister-street store. There she found
that either the picture or the frame
was unsatisfactory, but Mr. Silver
etein resolutely refused to return either
the original photograph or the cash
deposit until he was paid the sum
which she had agreed to pay for the
frame â and in some instances the sum
demanded by him was larger than the
sum she had agreed to pay. As , the
photographs were usually valued very
highly by their owners, the ladies com
plained to the police, with the result
that Mr. Silverstein was arrested and
charged with obtaining money by false
pretense.
In a dialect that Barney Bernard
could well afford to envy Mr. Silver
stein denied intent to defraud. He had
been established in the business only
six weeks, he said, and he Intended to
get out of it as speedily as possible,
because It brought him more trouble
than the rewards were
worth. Some of his trusted agents
had deceived him, and his store was
vi,sited daily by angry women, who
abused him roundly because he would
not give back the deposits and the
photographs which the agents had ob
tained from them. One German lady
went so far in her wrath as to as
sault him.
"I think the sooner you retire from
your present business the better it will
be for you and the community," said
Judge Mogan to Mr. Sllversteln. "Even
if your agents did play you false, the
women from whom they obtained mon
ey and photographs should not be made
to suffer for it. Under the law the em
ployer is responsible for the business
acts of his employes. Besides, your
business seems to have been rather a
tricky business throughout. The com
plainants were deceived In the first
place by the assurance that the en
larged picture would cost them noth
ing, but that assurance. It appears, was
merely to get possession of the photo
graph and to subsequently Induce them
to purchase a frame for more than it
was worth. The best thing you can
do Is to restore to the complainants
all that you have obtained from them
and I will give you until Saturday
morning to do it."
Thus was shattered another shrewd
project that aimed to take advantage
of the popular yearning to obtain
something for nothing.
Seventeen-year-old Tommle White,
stoutly denied that his life aim Is to be
a hobo, despite the fact that he Jour
neyed from Denver to San Ifranclsco
as a brakebeam tourist and was ar
rested while In the company of profes
sional tramps. He left his Colorado
home, Tommle said, to seek employ
ment, and if he had ever harbored am
bition to be a W^ary Willie his expe
riences on the trip from the Rockies
to the Pacific would heve dispelled it.
The life of a toiler was good enough
for him and If he were restored to
freedom hs wpuld hasten to seek a Job.
"Go down to the glass works," said
Judge Fritz to the boy. "and tell the
manager that you want to work and
that I hope he will give you' an oppor
tunity to earn a livelihood. You can't
dodge work and remain -in San Fran
cisco, and I'd advise you to /abstain
from trying it." â¢
There was no reason to doubt the
sincerity of Tommy's declaration that
he would proceed straight from the
courtroom to the glass works.
James Jackson (colored) had donned
a new sweater for his third appearance
before Judge Mogan on the charge of
stealing a bicycle from 17-year-old
Johnnie Benzinskl. It was truly : a
striking garment, the color scheme be
ing alternate stripes of purple and
green, with dashes .of scarlet in the
collar and cuffs. ....<<. ,
In addition, to Master Benzinski there
appeared as witness for the urosccu-
tlon Wellington Alexander Sullivan
(colored), who testified that he was
Janitor of the- building at 318 Pine
street, and that on more than one oc
casion he had reason to question Mr.
Jackson's honesty. He cited the simul
taneous disappearance of Mr. Jackson
and a stepladder. and darkly hinted
that all the sweaters flaunted by Mr.
Jackson had not been purchased by
him.
Mr. Jackson tacitly confessed that he
had taken the Benzinskl bicycle, but
denied that the taking was with felo
nious intent. " 'Twas ma puppus," he
said, "to restoah dat yah w'eel to its
propah j ownali dat same aftahnoon,
but â we'll, yah knows wot booze is."
He was ordered to pay Master Ben
zinskt the sum of $15, the bicycle's
market value, before 11 o'clock this
morning or be prepared for the recep
tion of a six months' sentence from
Judge Mogan.
Gee Neon Yl was arrested and
booked for disturbing the peace of
Quong Yong Qui, but when the case
was called before Judge Fritz there ap
peared instead of the complainant a
message from him to {he effect that he
feared his life might be taken if he
prosecuted. His Honor continued the
case illl to-day and Instructed the po
liceman to inform the discreet Quong
that to trifle with the law's machin
ery is hardly less dangerous an to
provoke the wrath of a highbinder.
Steve Potter's mother-in-law, Mrs.
MargareJ Moore of 633 Second street,
complains that he -efuses to provide
for the support of his 6-year-old son;
and Judge Mogan has summoned him
to appear to-day and show cause. Pot
ter is a teamster, and recently his wife,
from whem he is separated, had him
arrested for assaulting her when she
asked him to contribute to their child's
maintenance.
John Yorkovich professed inability to
explain how lottery tickets got J into
his pocket. He was arrested in Chi
natown, and when the tickets were
found he affected great Jrprise. Judge
Mogan listened sympathetically to
John's statement, and thtn .-.pake as
follows:
"This thing: of i â optttiously shov
insr lottery tickets Into the pockets or
white visitors to the Celestial quarter
is a mischievous practice, and should
be stopped toy a vigilant police. Hard
ly a day passes that does not bring: be
fore me some gentleman who has been
arrested in Chinatown for having lot
tery tickets In his posseislon. and the
Invariable defense is that the tickets
must have been placed there by some
person or persons unknown. The fact
that the tickets were purchased a short
time prior to their discovery, and that
they must have cost the unknown
practical joker or Jokers a considerable
sum of money, makes the matter all
the more mysterious. Meantime, Mr.
Yorkovich. I must fine you 55 for â¢ l
Â¦ lowing your pockets to be stuffed when
'you weren't looking-."

kiads of remedies that I conld think of,
but nothing seemed to help ; In fact. It
prew worse. Her hair fell oat where
the sore was, and I feared it would nevtr
grow again. It continned until my aged
father came on a visit, and when ha
eaw the baby be told me to jet Cntl-

" To please him I did bo, and to ray
