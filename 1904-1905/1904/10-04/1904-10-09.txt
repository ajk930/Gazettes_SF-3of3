This purchase, of the "J la-rv kÂ»

the modest beginning of GastoJ the
marvelous. By-time the temporary

heralded far and wide that the West

Thereupon followed one of the sense

the cattle ranges In ever widening cir

The Sunday Call Magazine
THE GRAFTERSA Man of the People.
CHAPTER II.
Loring was gazing steadfastly at the
blank,"heavy face,, so utterly devoid of
the enthusiasm the man was evoking
In others. For one flitting Instant he
thought he saw behind the mask. The
Immobile face, the awkward gestures,
the slipshod English became suddenly
transparent, revealing the real man; a
man of titanic strength, of tremendous
possibilities for good or evil. Loring
put ' up his glasses and looked again;
but the figure of the flashlight â¢ inner
vision had vanished and the speaker
was answering his .objector as calmly
as though the house held only the sin
gle critic to bÂ£set right.
"I'm always glad to hear a man
speak right out in meeting," he said,
dropping still deeper into the collo
quialisms. "Supposing the', corpora
tions don't see the handwriting on the
wallâ won't see it, you say? Then, my
friend,- it will become the manifest duty
of the Legislature and.. the executive
to make. 'em see it; always lawfully,
you understand; always with a just
and equitable respect for the rights of
property in which our free and gldri
ous Institutions are f ouhded. but^ with
level handed justice and without fear
or favor."
A thunderous, uproar, of applause
clamored on "the .heels" of the answer,
afcd the'Hon. Jasper mopped his face
"The chance hasn't been lacking.
But my business out here is â Well, it
isn't exactly a star chamber matter,
but I'm under promise in a way not
to talk about it until I have had a con
ference with our people at the capital.
I'll write you about it in afew days."
They were ascending the steps at the
end of the passenger .platform again,
and Lcring broke away from the politi
cal and personal entanglement to give
Kent one more opportunity to hear his
word of negative comfort.
"We dug up the field of recollection
pretty thoroughly In our after-dinner
seance in your rooms, David, but I no
ticed there was one corner of it you
left undisturbed. Was there any good
reason?" :A 'Â¦â¢ : >.
Kent made no show' of misunder
standing.
"There was the excellent : reason
which must have been apparent to you
before you had been an hour in Gaston
I've made, my shot, and missed.'* '-
Loring entered the breach with his
shield held well to the fore. He was
the last man in the world to assault a
friend's confidence recklessly.
"I thought a good while ago, and I
still think, that you are making a
mountain, out of a mole-hill, David.
Elinor Brentwood is a .true woman in
every inch of her. She is as v much
above caring for false notions of caste
I've suffered what you've suffered.
Year after year we send our represen
tatives to the Legislature and what
comes of Jt? Why, these corporations,
looking only to their own Interests, as
they're In duty bound to do, buy 'em
if they can. You can't blame 'em
for that; it's businessâ their busi
ness. ' But it's our business, as
citizens of this great commonwealth
to prevent It. We have good laws
on our statute books, but we need more
of 'em; laws for control, with plain,
hohest'men at the capital, in the ju
diciary, in every root and branch of
the executive, to lnf orce 'em. With
such laws and such men to see that
they are executed .there wouldn't be
any more extortions, any rnore raising
of the rates of transportation on the
produce of our ranches and farms
merely, because the Eastern market for
that particular product happened to
jump a few cents on the dollar.
"No, my friends; plain, hard handed
farmer though I be, I can see what will
follow an honest election of the peo
ple, by the people and for the people.
The State can beâ it ought to beâsov
ereign within its own boundaries. If
we rise up "as one ma*i next Tuesday
and put a ticket into the . ballot box
that says we are going to make It so,
an* keep It so, you'll see a new com
modity, tariff put into effect on the
Tf estern Pacific Railroad the day af
ter."..
The speaker paused and into the^llt
tle gap of silence barked a voice from
the gallery. Â¦ S . .
â¢'That's what you say. But supposin'
they don't do it?" ,
tlce meted out to ourselves, our -wives
and our little- children, they'll come
down and quit watering their stock
with the sweat of our brows; and that
hold-up motto of theirs. 'All the tariff
the traffic will stand," will be no more
known In Israel!' '%
Again the clamor of applause rose
like fine dust on the throng-heated air,
and Kent looked at his watch."
"It Is time we were 'going," he said;
adding: "I guess you have had enough
of it, haven't you?"
Loring was silent for' the better part
of the way back to the railway station.
When he spoke of it was in answer to
a delayed question of Kent's.
"What do I think of him? I don't
know, David; and that's the plain
truth. He is not the man he appears
to be as he stands there haranguing
that crowd. That is a pose, and an
exceedingly skillful one. He is ' not
altogether apparent to me, but he
strikes me as being a man of Immense
possibilitiesâ whether for good or evil
I can't say." 'V
"You needn't draw another breath of
uncertainty on. that score," was the
curt rejoinder. "He is a demagogue,
pure and unadulterated."
Loring did not- attempt to refute the
charge.
"Are he and his party likely to win?"
he asked.
"God knows," said Kent. "We have
had so mar- lightnir~ transformations
In politics in the State that nothing Is
impossible." - ;
"I'd like to know." was Loring's com
ment. , "It might make some difference
to me, personally."
"To you?" said Kent, inquiringly.
"Tha.f reminds me: I haven't given
you a chance to say ten words about
yourself."
"You swear pretty feelingly, David.
Isn't our property as good a thing as
we cf the Boston end have been crack-
Ing it up to be?"
"You know better about the financial
parf of !t than I do. Butâ well, you
are fresh from this anarchistic conclave
at the opera-house. You can imagine
what *the stock of the Western Pacific
or of any other foreign corporation do-
Ing business in this State will be worth
in six months after Bucks and his
crowd get into the saddle."
"You sneak as if the result of the
election were a foregine conclusion. I
hope it isn't. . But we were talking
more particularly of Miss Brentwood
and your personal* responsibilities."
The belated- train was whistling for
the lower yard, and Lorin'g was deter
mined to say. all that was in his mind.
"Yes, . so on. I'm anxious to hear â
more anxious than I seem to be, ner-'
haps." ; ' * .
"By the shortest possible route. If
you had done your duty by Elinor in
the Croydon summer, Mrs. Brentwood
would have had a bright young attor
ney for a son-in-law and adviser, and
the bad investments would tiot have
been made."
Kent's laugh was. entirely devoid of
mirth.
â¢ "Don't trample on a man when he's
down. I was neither a prophet nor the
son of a prophet. But how bad is Vhe
smash? Surely you know that?"
"No, I don't Bradford was telling
me about it the day I left Boston. He
gave me to understand that the prin
cipal family holding at present is in
the stock of a certain Western rall
v/ay." ' j . :.
"Did he happen to know the name of
the stock?" aaked Kent, moistening his
lips.
"He did. Fate flirts with yon two in
the usual fashion. Mrs. Brentwood's
little fortuneâ and by consequence. Eli
nor's and Penelope'sâ Is tied up In the
stock of the company whose platform
we are occupinj? nt the present moment
âthe Western Pacific."
Kent let slip a hard word directed
at ill-advisers in general, and Loring
took his cue from the malediction.
is moving me mightily to hold my
tongue."
"Tell me," said Kent, his indifference
vanishing in the turning of a leaf.
"Well, to begin with, Miss Brentwood
is still unmarried, though the gossips
eay she doesn't lack plenty of eligible
offers."
"Half of that I knew: the other half
I tpok for granted. Go on."
"Her mother, under the advice of
the chief of the clan Brentwood, has
been making a lot of bad Investments
for herself and her two daughters; in
other words, she has been making
ducks and drakes of the â¢ Brentwood
fortune."
Kent v.as as deeply moved as If the
loss had been his own, and said as
much, craving more of the particulars.
"I can't give them. But I may say
that the blame lies at your door,
David."'
"At my door? How do you arrive
at that?"
tions to the speaker. -
Measured by the standard of fitness
for his .office of: prolocutor v the mar*
standing beside the stage .properties
speaker's desk was worthy a second
glance. He was dark, undersized,
trimly built, . with a Vandyke beard,
clipped closely, enough to, show, the lines
of a bulldog Jaw and eyes that had
the gift, priceless to the public speaker,
of seeming to hold every onlooking eye
in the audience. Unlike his backers in
the awkward semicircle, he- wore a
professional long coat, and -the hands
that marked his smoothly flowing sen
tences were slim and shapely^'.^. .
"Who is he?" asked Lorftii'Jf'ln an
aside to Kent.
"Stephen Hawk, the ex-District At
torneyâboomer, pettifogger. ' promoter
âa charter member of the Gaston wolf
pack. A man who would persuade you
into believing in the Impeccability, k of
Satan in one breath and knife you In
tbe back for a $10 bill in the next" was
the rejoinder.
Loring nodded and again became a
listener. Hawk's speech was merely in
troductory and it was nearing Its
peroration.
"Fellow citizens, this occasion Is aa
auspicious as It is significant When

presses them, 'Thus far and no farther
shalt thou go,' the night -Is far spent
and the light is breaking in the east.
"Since the day when we first began
to wrest with compelling hands the
natural riches from the sDil of this our
adoptive State political trickery in high,
places, backed by the puissant might
of alien corporations, has ground us
into the dust * Â° . <
"But now the time of our deliverance
is at hand. Great movements give
birth to great leaders; and in this, our
holy crusade against oppression and
tyranny, the crisis has bred the man.
Ladles and gentlemen, I have the
pleasure in presenting to you ' the
speaker of the evening, our friend and
fellow citizen, the Honorable Jasper G.
Bucks,' by the grace of God and your
suffrages the next Governor of the
State."
In the storm of applause that burst
upon the dramatic peroration of the
ex-District Attorney, a man rose from
the center of the stage semicircle Rnd
lumbered heavily forward to the foot
lights. Loring's first emotion was of
surprise, tempered with pity. The cri
sis born leader, heralded by. such a
flourish of rhetorical trumpets; was a
giant in . Bize ; but with his . huge fig
ure, unshapely and ill clad, all promise*
of greatness seemed to pause.
His face, .broad featured, colorless,
and beardless as a. boy's,, was either
a blank, or : an Impenetrable [ mask.
There "was no convlncement m . the
lack-luster gaze of the small, porcine
eyes; no eloquence In the harsh,. nasal
tones of the 'untrained voice, or; in the
ponderous | and awkward wavings of
the beam like arms. None, the less, be
fore he had uttered a dozen halting
sentences he was carrying "the audl-
"We are. I should think a .good bit
less of myself than I doâ and that's
needless â if I trained In his company."
"Yet you will give' him a chance to
make a partisan of me? Well, come
along. Politics are not down on my
Western programme, but I'm here to
see all the .new things."
The . Gaston Opera-house was a sur
vival of the flush times, and barring
a certain tawdriness from disuse and
neglect and a rather garish â¢ effect
which marched evenly with the brick
ar.d terra cotta fronts in Texas, street
and the American-Tudor, cottages of
the suburbs, it was a creditable relic.
â¢ The auditorium was well filled in pit,
dress circle and gallery when Kent and
"We can kill an hour at the rally,
if you like. You have seen the street
parade and heard the band play; it is
only fair that you should see the men
agerie on exhibition."
Loring found his match box and
made a fresh light for his cigar.
"It's pretty evident that you and
'next-Governor' Bucks are on opposite
bides of the political fence," he ob
served. .
Loring got up, looked at his watch,
and made a suggestion, hoping that
Kent would fall in with it. "
"I don't know. Shall we go back to
your rooms and sit a while?"
The exile's eyes gloomed suddenly.
"Not unless . you Insist on it We
should get' back among the relics and
I should bore you. I'm not the man
you used to know, Grantham."
"No?" Bald Loring. "I shan't be hyp
ocritical enough to contradict you.
Nevertheless, you are my host. It is
for you to say what you will do with
me until train time."
Loring knew Kent's fierce poverty
pride â none better. Hence, 'he was at
no loss to account for the exile's
flight afield, or for his, unhopeful pres
ent attitude. Meaning to win trophies
to lay at Mis* Brentwood's feet the
present stage of the rough joust with
Fortune found him unhorsed, un
weaponed and rolling in the dust of
the lists.
Loring chewed his cigar reflectively,
wishing his companion would open the
way to free 6peech on the. subject pre
sumably nearest his heart. He had a
word of comfort, negative comfort, to
offer, but it might not.be said until
Kent should give him leave by taking
initiative. Kent broke silence at last
but the Â¦ prompting was . nothing more
pertinent than the chalking tip of the
delayed train's time.
"An htiur and twenty minutes: that
means any time after 3 o'clock. I'm
honestly sorry- ..for you, Grantham â
sorry for any one that has to stay in
this charnel-house of a town ten min
utes after he's through. What- will
you do with yourself?"
but they lived in their own house in
the Back Bay wilderness, moved . In
Boston's older substantial circle, and,
in a world where success, economic or
other, is in some sort the touchstone,
were many social planes above a coun
try lawyer.
It is one of the prime requisites of
successful mastership to know when
to press the point home, and uhcr. to
recede gracefully. Ormsby abruptly
*hut the door upon sentiment and
carre down to thirds nractlcal.
"It is your everv-day comfsrt that
cencerrs me chiefly. I am going to
take all three of you in. charge, giving
the dependable yours: person a well
earned holidayâ a little journey in
which she won't have to chaffer with
the transit people. Have you rhosen
your route to the western somewhere?"
Miss Brentwood had the fair, trans
parent skin that tells tales and thÂ»
"And you will be bored, world with
out ?nd." he laughed. "Never mind:
I'll be decent about It and keep out of
your way as much as you like."
Again she made the little gesture of
petulant Impatience.
"You are continually placing ire in
a false position. Can't you leave me
cut of it entirely?"
"If you think that, I withdraw my
objection." she said coldly. "Mother
and Penelope will be delighted, I am
sure."
Her eyesâ they were the serene eyes
of cool gray that take on slate-btue
tints in stressful momentsâ met his
defiantly. *- -
"Yes, you are. You know In your
own heart there Is no reason why ymi
should continue to makp me unhappy,
and you are afraid I might over-per
suade you."
"You are forgetting your promise."
she said quite dispassionately. "WÂ»
were to be friends: as good friends as
we were before that evening at. Bar
Harbor. I told you It would be im
possible, and you said you were strong
enough to make it possible."
He looked at her with narrowing
eyes.
"It la possible in a way. But I'd
like to know what door of your heart
it is that I haven't been able to open.'*
She ignored the pleading and took
refuge In a woman's expedient.
"If yoxi insist on going back to thÂ»
beginnings. I shall go back, al3oâ to
Abigail and the trunk-packing."
He planted himself squarely before
her, the mask lifted and the masterful
soul asserting itself boldly.
"It wouldn't do any good, you know.
I am going with you."
"To Abigail and the trunkroomT*
"Oh. no; to the Jumping-off place
out Westâ wherever it is you are going
to hibernate." . * . % .
"No," she said decisively; "you mus^
not."
"Why?"
"My saying so ought to be sufficient
reason." . .
"It isn't." he contended, frowning
down on her gcodnaturedly. "Shall I
tell you why you don't want me to go?
It is because you are afraid."
"I am not," she denied.
"I don't know; sometimes I think I
should. But I have had to be the man
of the house since father died."
"I know." he said. "And It is the
petty anxieties that have made you
put the woman to the wall. I'm here
this morning to save you some of
them: to take the man's part In your
outsetting, or as much of it as I can.
When are you going to give me thÂ«
right to come between you and all the
little worries', Elinor."
She turned frc-m him with a faint
gesture of cold impatience.
"I suppose not. Yet I'm always try
ing to make myself believe other th!ng9
about you. Don't you like to be cared
for like other wc-men?"
"The sentimental yor.nsr woman went
out some time ago, didn't she? One
can't be an anachronism."
"You arc hard with me. Elinor â al
ways flinty and adamantine, and that
sort. Have you no sqft side at all?".
She laughed.
It was precisely cm T the day set for
the Brentwoods' westward flitting that
the postman, making- his morning
round, delivered David Kent's asking
at the house In the Back Bay sub-dis
trtpt Elinor was busy packing for the
migration, but she left Penelope and
the maid to cope with the problem of
compressing two trunkfuls into one
while she read the letter, and she was
reading it a second time when Mr.
Brookes Ormsby's card came up.
"You go, Penelope." she begged.
.There la so much to do."
"Not I,'* said the younger sister,
cavalierly; "he didn't come to see me."
Whereupon Elinor smoothed the two
small wrinkles of impatience out of her
brow, tucked her letter into her bosom,
and went down, to meet the early morn
ing caller.
Mr. Brookes Ormsby, clubman, gen
tleman of athletic leisure and inheritor
of the Ormsby millions, was pacing
back and forth before the handful of
fire in the drawing-room grate when
she entered.^ â¢
"You don't deserve to have a collts
sheep dog- friend,'* he protested Re
proachfully. "How was I to know that
you were going away?"
Another time Elinor might have felt
that she owed him an explanation, but
Just now she was careful, and troubled
about the packing.
"How was I to know you didn't
know?" she retorted. "It was in the
Transcript."
"Well 1 " said Ormsby. "Things have
come to a pretty pass when I have to
keep track of you "through the soceity
column. I didn't see the paper. Dyck
man 'brought me word List night at
Vineyard Haven and we broke a pro
peller blade on the Amphitrite trying
to get here in time."
"I am so sorry â for the Amphitrite."
she said. "But you are here and in
good -season. Shall I call mother and
Nell?"
"No. 1 1 ran out to see if I'm in time
to do your errands for youâ take your
tickets, and so on."
"Oh. we shouldn't think of troubling
you. James can do all those things.
And falling James, there Is a very de
pendable young woman at the head of
this household. Haven't I 'personally
conducted' the family all over
.Europe?"
"James Is a base hireling," said the
caller, blandly. "And as for the cap
able young woman: do I or do I not
recollect a dark nisht on the German
frontier when she was glad enough to
call on a sleepy fellow pilgrim to help
her wrestle with a particularly thick
headed customs officer?"
"If you do. it Is not especially kind
of you to remind her of it."
He looked up quickly, and the mas
terful soul of the man. for which the
clean-cut, square-set jaw and the ath
letic figure were the outward present
ments, put on a mask of deference and
humility.

things save only twoâ the exile's cast
for fortune in the untamed West, and
one other.
'That- brings us a littla, nearer to the
things that beâ and to your prospects,
David," said the guest. "How are you
fixed here?"
Kent shrugged.
"Gufton is dead, as you see; too dead
to bury."
"Why don't you get out of it, then?"
"I shall some day, v perhaps. Up to
date there has been no place to go to
ar.d no good way to arrive. Like some
thousands of others, I've made an ass
uf myseif here, Loring."
"By coming, you mean? Oh, I don't
know about that. You have had some
hard knocks. I take it but if you are
the same David Kent I used to know
they have made a bigger man of you."
"Think so?" * >' - '
"I'd bet on it We have had the Gas
ton epic done out for us in the news
papers. No man could live through
such an experience s.s you must have
had without growing a few Inches.
Hello! What's this?"
A turned corner had brought them In
front of a lighted building in Texas
street with a straggling crowd gath
ered about the porticoed entrance. As
Loring fpoke th.ere was a^ rattle of
snare drums, followed by the dum-dum
of the bass, and a brass band ramped
out the opening measures of a cam
paign march. >
"It is a rally," said Kent when they
had passed far enough beyond the zone
of brase-throated "clamor-ings to make
the reply audible. "I told you that the
Gaston wolf-pack had gone Into poll
tics. We are in the throes of a State
election, and there is to be a political
speech-making at the opera-house to
nig-ht, with Bucks in the title role. And
there is a fair measure of the deadness*
of the town! When you see people
flock together like that to hear a brass
band play, it means one of two things:
ihat the town hasn't outgrown the
country village stage, or else it has
I>assed that and a.11 other stages and is
veil on its way to the cemetery."
"That is one way of putting it" Lor
ing; rejoined. "If thinps are as bad as
that, it's time you were moving on,
don't yon think?"
"I guess so." was the lack-luster re
eponFe. "Only I don't know where to
go, or what to do when I get there."
They were crossing the open square
In front of the wide-eaved passenger
Btation. A thunderous tremolo, doini
natirg the distant band music, thrilled
on the still air, and the extended arm
of the station semaphore' with its two
danplinjj lanterns wagged twice. '
"My train," said Loring, .quickening
his step. '
"Xu." Kent corrected. "It Is a special

Th c v mounted the steps to. the sta
tion platform tn good to meet the
three-tar special as it came -clattering
in over the switches, and presently
found themselves in the thick of the
crowd of de-barking ralliers.
It vas a mixed masculine multitude,
fairly typical of time, place. and Ocea
nian; stalwart men of the soil for the
greater part, bearded and bronzed and
rough clothed, with here and there a
range rider in picturesque leathern
chaps, naggizig pistols and wide-flapped
sombrero.
Loring stood aside end put up his
i-y-plasEes. It v.as his first sight t near
at hand of the untramrneled West in
puris naturalibus, and he was finding
the spectacle both instructive and di
vtrtir.p. LookfnR to Kent for fellow-
Fhip he saw that his companion was
holding himself stiffly aloof; also, he
remaikfd that none of the boisterous
partisans flung a word of recognition
in Kent's direction.
"Don't you know any of them?** ho
asked.
Kent's reply **as lest in the deep
chested bull-bellow of a cattleman from
the Rio Blanco.
"Hold on a minute, boys, before you
scatter: Line up here, and let's give
three cheer? ar.d a tail-twister for next
Governor Bucks! Now, then â every
body: Hip. hip â "
The ripping cra?h of the cheer jarred
Lorinjr's eyeglasses from their hold and
be replaced tli3"n with a smile. Four'
Times the ear-j-jilitting shout went up.
and as the echoes of the "tiger** trailed
ofi r into filc-nce the stentorian voice was
lifted again.
"Good enough! Now, then, three
frroj:ns for the land syndicates, alien
mortgagees and the Western Pacific
Itailroad, by grabs: And to hell with
'cm!*'
The responsive clamor was a thing
to l,e acutely remembered â sustained,
long-drawn. vindictive; a nerve
Â¦wrenchir-s pandemonium of proans,
yelpings avA catcalls, in the midst of
which the partisans shuffled in loose
marching order and tramped away
tov.nward.
"That answers your question,
doesn't it?" said Kent, smiling sour
ly. "If not. I can set it out for you
In words. The Western PadCe is "the
best hated corporation this side of
the aflssisflppi, ar.d I am its local at

"I don't envy you." said Loring. "I
had no idea the opposition crystallized
Itself in any such tone-rote ill will.
You rr.ust have the v.hole weight of
public sentiment against you in any
railroad litigation."
"I do." said Kent, simply. "If every
complainant against us had the right
to pack his own jury we couldn't fare
worse."
"What is at the bottom of it? Is
It our pricking of the Gaston bubble
by building en to the capital?"
"Oh, no; it's much more personal to
these shouters. As you may, or may
not, know, our line â like every other
Western railroad with no competition
âhas for its motto, 'AH the' tariff the
traffic will Ftand.' and it bleeds the
country accordingly. But we are for

"Does Miss Brentwood know?"
j "She knows nothing at all.. I was un

"The more fool you." said Loring,
bluntly.\ "You call yourself a lawyer,
and you have not yet learned one of
the' first principles of common Justice,
which is that a woman has some rights
which even a besotted lover Is beund

it. And at the end of things you walk
off to -make your fortune without com
mitting yourself; without knowing, or
apparently caring, what your stiff
necked poverty-pride may cost her In
years of uncertainty. You deserve- to

Kent's smile was "a fair measure of
his unhopeful mood. :Â¦â..?;
"You can't well lose what, you have

Â°Â£ Â« ts hamperings? Or was it merely
that the v people, weary of empty rhe
toric and unkept promises, were ripe
to welcome and to follow any man
whose apparent earnestness and sin
cerity atoned for all his lacks?
ExplainMt as he might. Loring soon
assured himself that the Hon: Jasper
G. Bucks was laying hold of the sen
timent of the audience as though it
?? er Â« a thing tangible to be grasped by
the huge hands. Unlike Hawk, whose
speech^ flamed' easily into denuncia
tion whenMt touched on the alien cor
porations, he counseled moderation and
lawful reprisals. Land syndicates, rail
roads, foreign capital in whatever em
ployment, were prime necessities in
any new and growing commonwealth.
The province of the people was not to
wreck the ship, but to guide it. And
the remedy for all Ills lay In controll
ing legislation, faithfully and ' rigidly
lnforced. '
: "My friends: I'm only a plain, hard
handed " farmer, as those of you who
are my fellow townsmen can testify.
But I*vÂ« Â«**n what you've seen, and
flndlng and recrimination and had
finally made an end of the matter by
"bestowing her dowry of hillside acres
on the son of a neighboring farmer.
Therefore Kent had stagnated
quietly, living with simple rigor the
life he had marked out for himself;
thankful at heart, Loring had- sus
pected, for the timely intervention of
the farmer's son. but holding himself
well in hand against a repetition of
the sentimental offense. . All this until
the opening of the summer hotel at
the foot of Old Croydon and the com
ing of Elinor Brentwood.
No one knew Just how much Miss
Brentwood had to do with the long
delayed awakening of David Kent;
but in Loring's forecastings she en
joyed the full benefit 'of the doubt
Prom tramping the hills alone or
whipping the streams for brook trout,
David had taken to spending his after
noons with lover-like regularity at the
Croydon Inn, and at the end of the
season had electrified. the sleepy home
town by declaring his Intentions to go
West and grow up with the country.
In Loringr's setting forth of the
awakening the motive was not far to
seek. Miss Brentwood was ambitious,
and If her interest In Kent had been
only casual she would not have been
likely to point him to the wider bat
.tlefleld. Again, apart from his modest
patrimony, Kent had only his profes
sion. The Brentwoods were not rich,
as riches ax* measured la mlHioruu
his guest edged their way through the
standing committee in the foyer; but
by dint of careful searching they suc
ceeded in finding two seats well around
to the left, with s a balcony pillar to
separate them from [ their nearest
neighbors. ,'
Since the public side of American
politics varies little with the varia
tion of latitude or' longitude, the
man from the East found himself
at once in homeful and remindful
surroundings.' There was the cus
tomary draping of flags under the
proscenium arch and across the set
piece vijla of the background. In the
semicircle of chairs arched from wing
to wing sat the local and visiting
political lights; men of all trades, these,
some of them a little shamefaced and
111 at ease by reason of their unwonted
conspicuity; all of them listening with
a carefully assumed air of strained at
tention to the speaker of the moment. .
Also there was the characteristic
ante-election audience? ' typical of all
Americaâthe thing most truly typical
in a land where national types are
sought . for microscopically, wheel
horses who came at the party call; men
who came In the temporary upblaze of
enthuBiastio patriotism, which is light
ed with the opening of the campaign
and which goes out like a candle in a
gust of wind the day after the election;,
men 'who came to applaud blindly, and
a few who came to cavil and deride.
LortnÂ» oriented himself in a leisurely
Â«resweej> and bo cam* by â¢asy grad*-
"If I were you. David, I'd write and
ask; I should, by Joye. It would be a
tremendously cheeky thing to do, of
course, having such a slight acquain
tance with her as you have, but I'll
be hanged if I shouldn't chance it. And
in the meantime, if I don't ko back
Bast next week, you'll hear from m?.
When_you do, or if you do. tako a
day off and run up to the capital. I
shall need you. Good-by."
Kent watched the train pull out:
Stood looking after it until the two red
eyes of the rear signals had dis
appeared in the dusty darkness of the
illimitable plain. Then he went to hla
rooms, to the one which was called by
courtesy his office, and without allow
ing himself time for a nice balancing
of the pros and cons, squared himself
at the desk to write a letter
The train was In and the porter had
fetched taring's handbag from the
checkstand. The. guest paused with
one foot on the step of the sleeping
car.
"Well, she is coming West, after a
bit. She and her sister and the mother.
Mrs. Brentwood's asthma i$ worse and
the wise men have ordered her to the
interior. I thought you'd like to know."
"Is she â are they coming this way?"
asked Kent.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALIl
Train No. 3. the Western flyer, was
late, as Kent had predicted â just how
late the operator could not tell; and
pending 1 the chalking up of its arriv
ing time on the bulletin board the
two men sat on an empty baggage
truck and smoked In companionable
silence.
While they malted Loring's thoughts
Â¦were busy with many things, friendly
eolicitude for the exile serving as the
point of departure. Ho knew what a.
handfact friend might know; how
Kent had finished his post graduate
course in the law and had succeeded
to his father's small practice in the
New Hampshire county town where
he was born and bred. Also he knew
how Kent's friends, college friends
who knew his g-ifts and ability, had
deprecated the burial; and he him
self had been curious enough to pay
Kent a visit to spy out the reason
why. On their first evening together
In the stuffy little law of
fice which had been his father's, Kent
had made a clean breast of it: there
was a youns woman in the case, and
a promise passed before Kent had
gt>ne to college. She was a farmer's
daughter, with no notion for a- change
of environment; wherefore she had
determined Kent's career and the
â¢scene of it, laying its lines in the nar
row field of her own choosing:.
Later, as Loring knew, the senti
mental anchor had dragged until it
Â¦was hopelessly off .holding-ground.
The young woman had laid the blame
at the door of the university, had
given Kent a bad half-year of fault-""You are the pink of j dragomans,"
she said. "Don't you want to go and
smoke ?"
with three strangers.
Dinner, over, . there remained, but
twenty minutes of respite; but the
diplomatist kept his head, going back
to the -sleeping-car . with his charges
and dropping into the . seat beside
Elinor .with the' light of calm assurance
in his eye. ..
"You are quite comfortable?" he
began* "Sha'n't I have the Presence" in
the buffet make you a cup of tea'? That
in the diner didn't deserve the name."
She was regarding him with curious
anger in the gray eyes, and her reply
quite the kindly offer of re
freshment. . . .... .,-.;..
As if the solution of continuity had
been a call to arouse her, Elinor treed
her hand with a. swift little wrench
and sat bolt upright in her corner.
â "You make me very happy," he said
quietly, and Just then 'the train
slopped" with a jerk, and a. shuffling
tuistle of station : platform noises
floated in through the open deck
transoms of the car.
The* lights of ' a town suburb were
flitting past the windows and the
monotonous song of the tires was

late, them. The elderly banker in the
opposite section was. nodding over his
newspaper, and the newly married
ones 'were oblivious, each to all else
but -the other. Mrs. Brentwood was
apparently sleeping peacefully three
seats' away and Penelope was invisible.
So it came about that the outcome of
the cataclysm was a thins which hap

ized world. David Kent, with his trag
edy fresh upon him. dropped informally
into place as one of the party of five;
and of all the others Penelope alone
suspected how hard he was hit. And
when all was said, when the new
modus, Vivendi had been" fairly estab
lished and the hour grew late, Kent
went voluntarily:. with. Ormsby to the
smoking compartment, "to play the
string out decently," as he afterward
confessed to Loring.
"I see you know how to get the most
comfort out of your tobacco," said the
clubman when . they - were companion-
Measuring it out in all its despairing
length and breadth after the fact; he
was deeply, grateful to Penelope. Miss
ing her ready help at the moment of
cataclysms when he entered the sleep
ing-car, he might have Â¦ betrayed him
self. His first glance lighted on Elinor
and Ormsby, and â¢ he needed no gloss
on the love-text. He had delayed too
long; had asked too much of the fates,
and Atrooos, the scissors-bearing sis
ter, had snipped his thread of hope.
It is one of the consequences of civili
zation that we are denied the privilege
of unmasking at the behest of the ele
mental emotions â that we are con
strained to bleed decorously. Making
shift to lean heavily on Penelope, Kent
came through without doing or saying
anything unseemly. Mrs. Brentwood,
who had been sleeping with one eye
open,* and that eye upon Elinor and
Ormsby, made sure that she had now
no special reason to be ungracious to
David Kent. For the others. Ormsby
was good-naturedly suave, Elinor was
by turns unwontedly kind and curious
ly silent and Penelope â but, as we say,
it was to Peneloue that Kent owed
most.
In the midst of the type-rattling the
boy that served the few occupied of
.fices in the Farquhar building had
brought the afternoon ' mail. It in
cluded a letter from Loring, and there
was another reversive upheaval for
the exile. Loring's business at the
capital reas "no longer a secret. He
had been tendered the resident man
agement of the Western Pacific, with
headquarters on the ground, and had
accepted. His letter was a brief note,
asking Kent to report at once for legal
duty in the larger field. -
' "I am not fairly in the saddle yet,
and shall not be fOr a week or so,"
Â¦wrote the newly .appointed manager.
"But I find I am going to need a level
headed lawyer at my elbow from the
Jumpâ one who knows the State po
litical ropes and' isn't afraid of a
scrap. Come in on No. Three to-day.
If you can; if not, send a wire and say
when I may look for you. Or, bet
ter still, wire anyway."
David Kent struggled with his emo
tions until he had got his feet down to
the solid earth again. Then he tore
up the half written resignation and be
gan to smite things in order for the
flight. Could he make No. Three ?
Since that was the train named in
Penelope's message, nothing short of a
catastrophe should prevent his mak
ing it. .
He did make it, with an hour to
spare; an houT which he proceeded to
torn into a time of sharp trial for the
patient telegraph operator at the sta
tion, with his badgerings of the man
for news of Number Three. The train
reported â he took it as a special
miracle wrought in his behalf that the
Flyer was for this once abreast of her
scheduleâ he fell to tramping up and
down the long 1 platform, deep In an

would he find Miss Brentwood as he
had. left her? Could he be sure of
meeting her on the frank, friendly
footing of the Croydon summer? He
feared not; feared all thingsâlover
like.
He hoped there would he no ab

in some sort, and in battle a soldier
who could hew his way painstakingly,
if not drarnaticaly, to his end, David
Xent was *o- carpet knight, and he
knew his lack. Would Elinor make
things easy for him. as she -used to
daily in the somewhat difficult social
atmosphere of the exclusive summer
hotel? V. ; *>-;
It had been a day of upsettings for
David Kent, beginning with the late
breakfast at which Neltje, the night
watchman at the railway station, had
brought him Penelope's telegram.
At 10 he had a case in court: Shot
well vs. .. Western Pacific Company,
damages for stock killing; for the
plaintiff â Hawk; for the defendant â
Kent. With the thought .that he was
presently going to see Elinor again,
Kent went gayly to the battle legal,
meaning to wring victory out of a
jury drawn for the most part from
the plaintiff's stock raising neighbors.
By dint of great perseverance he man
aged to prolong the fight until the
middle of the afternoon, was worsted,
as usual, and so far lost his temper as
to get himself called down by the
Judge, MacFarlane.
Whereupon he went back to
the Farquhar building and to
his office and sat down at the
typewriter to pound out a let
ter to the general counsel, resigning 1
his sinÂ»cure. The Shotwell case was
the third he had lost for the com
pany in a single court term. Justice
for the railroad company, under pres
ent agrarian conditions, was not to be
had in the lower courts, and he was
weary of fighting the losing battle.
Therefore
GRAFTER V.
Journey's End
"If he should happen to drop in un
expectedly it will give Ellie the shock
of her life," she mused; and the tele
gram was smuggled into the hands
of the porter to be sent as occasion
offered.
Those who know Mr. Brookes Orms
by best were wont to say that the world
of action, a world lusting avidly for re
sourceful men, had lost the chance of
acquiring a promising leader when he
was born heir to the Ormsby millions.
Be that as it may, he made the most
of such opportunities for the exercising
of his gift as came to one for whom the
long purse leveled most barriersâ had
been making the most of the present
leaguer of a woman's heart â a citadel
whose capitulation was not to be com
passed by mere money-might, he would
have said.
Up to the final day of the long west
ward flight all things had gone well
with him. True, Elinor had not thawed
visibly, but she had been tolerant;
Penelope had amused herself at no"
one's expense save her ownâ a boon
for which Ormsby did not fail to be
duly thankful; and Mrs. Brentwood
had contributed \ her mite by keeping
hands off. . .; .
But at the dining-car luncheon on the
last day's run Penelope, languishing at
a table for two with an unresponsive
Ormsby for a vis-a-vis, made sly men
tion of the possible recrudescence of
one David Kent at a place called Gas
tonâthis merely to note the effect upon
an unresponsive table mate.
In Penelope's observings there was no
effect perceptible. Ormsby said "Ah?"
and asked if she would have more of
the salad. But later, in a contempla
tive half -hour with his pipe in the
smoking compartment, he let the scrap
of information sink in and take root.
Hitherto Kent had been little more
than a name to himâ a name he had
never heard on Elinor's lips. But if
love be blind in the teens and twenties,
it Is more than apt to have a keen* gift
of insight in the thirties and beyond.
Hence by the time Ormsby had come
to the second filling of his pipe he had
pieced together . bits of half-forgotten
gossip about the Croydon summer, cu
rious little reticences on Elinor's part,
vague hints let fall by Mrs. Brentwood
â enough to enable him to chart the
rock on which his Jtove argosy was
drifting, and -to ham* itâ David Kent.
Now/to a well-knhr man of the world
â who happens to be a heaven-born
diplomatist into the .bargainâ to be
forewarned is to be doubly armed. .'At
the end of the half-hour of, studious
solitude in the smoking-room* Ormsby
had cricked out his course on the chart
"Oh, I don't know; any other young
woman of his acquaintance would, I
fancy. I have half a mind to do It
myself. I like him, if you don't care
for him any more."
Thus Penelope; and Â«. little while
afterward, finding herself in the li
brary compartment with blanks and
pen and ink convenient and nothing
better to do, she impulsively made the
threat good in a ten-word message to
Kent.
"Why should I?" said Elinor warily.
Penelope's fine eyes clouded. At
times Elinor's thought processes were
as plain as print to the younger sis
ter; at other times they were not.
?'I should think the least we could do
would be to let him know," she ven
tured. "Does anybody know what time
the train passes Gaston?"
"At 7:15 o'clock to-morrow evening,"
was the unguarded reply; and Pene
lope drew her own conclusions from the
ready answer and the folded time table
ia Elinor's lap.
"Well, why don't you send him a
wire? I'm sure I should."
"We are on our own railroad now,
aren't we?" she asked, with purposeful
lack-interest. "Andâ let me see â isn't
Mr. Kent at some little town we pass
through?"
"It is a city," said Elinor. "And the
name is Gaston."
"I remember now." Penelope rejoined.
"I wonder if we shall see him?"
"It is most unlikely. He does not
know we are coming and he wouldn't
be looking for us."
"What a vivid imagination you have,
Nell, dear," she scoffed. Then she
changed the subject arbitrarily: "Is
mother quite comfortable? Did you
have . the porter put a screen in her
window? â You know, she always insists
she can't breathe without it."
Penelope evaded the gueries and took
her turn at subject wrenching â an art
in which she excelled.
She was still gazing- steadfastly upon
the wall of outer darkness when the
porter began to make down the berths
and Penelope came over to sit in the
opposite seat. ' A moment later the
younger sister made a discovery, or
thought she did. . .
"Why, Elinor Brentwood:" she said.
"I believe you are crying!"
Elinor's smile was serenity undis
turbed. ,
said something that made him think
he ought to try. But it's no use. It was
only a little summer -idyl, and we
have both outlived it."
As may be surmised, a diligent suitor,
old enough to plan thoughtfully, and
yet young enough to stimulate the
youthful ardor of a lover whose hair
has not begun to thin at the temples,
would lose no ground in a three days'
journey and the opportunities it af
forded. -
In Penelope's phrase, Elinor "suf
fered him," enjoying her freedom from
care like a sleepy kitten; shutting the
door on the past and keeping it shut
until the night when their through
sleeper was coupled to the Western
Pacific Flyer at A. and T. Junction.
But late that evening, when she was
rummaging her handbag for a hand
kerchief, she came upon David Kent's
letter and read it again.
"Loring tells me you are coming
\West," ho wrote. "I assume there is
at â¢ least one chance in three that you
will pass through Gaston. If you do,
and if the hour is not altogether im-
It was the final straw. When any
weakness of the human heart can find
a seeming virtue to go hand in hand
with It, thq battle is as good as lost;
and at that moment Brookes Ormsby,
placidly refilling his short pipe in the
smoking-room of the Pullman, was by
no means in the hopeless case he was
sometimes temoted to fancy himseW.
Elinor faced her major weakness
unflinchingly. She was not a slave
tc luxuries â the luxuries of the very
rich. On the contrary, she had tried
to make herself believe that hardness
was a part of her creed. But latterly,
she had been made to see that there
was a .formidable array of thing3
which Brookes Ormsby's wife might
reckon among the simplest necessities
of the dafly life, but which David
Kent's wife might have to forego; nay,
things which Elinor Brentwood might
presently have to forego. For she
ccmpelled herself to front the fact
of the diminished patrimony square
ly. So long as the modest Western
Pacific dividends were forthcoming,
they could like comfortably and with
out pinching. But failing these
"No, I'm not great enough," she con
fessed, with a little shiver. "I should
be utterly miserable. If I could afford
to indulge in ideals it would be differ
ent; but I can'tâ not when one word
of mine will build a barrier so high
that all the soul-killing little skimp
ings can never climb over it. And be
sides, I owe something to mother and
Nell."
Her eyes grew hot under the closed
lids when she remembered. At the
time the hard saying was evoked there
v.-as money enough for two, if David
Kent would have shared it. But he
had held his peace and gone away,
and now there was not enough for
two.
She closed her eyes, recalling the
words and the occasion. "Yon are
merely wasting time and sentiment on
this young upstart of a country law
yer, Elinor. So long as you were con
tent to make it a summer day's
amusement, I had nothing to say; you
are old enough and sensible enough to
choose your own recreations. But in"
justice to yourself, no less than to
him. you must let it end with our go
ing home. You haven't money enough
for two."
"I promised not to bore you." he
had said, "and I sha'n't. Send the
porter after me if there is anything
I have forgotten to do."
She took up the mag .ie he had
left on the seat beside lu-r and sought
to put away the disquieting th'oughts.
But they refused to be dismissed, and
now among them rose up another,
dating back to that idealizing sum
mer at the foot of Old Croydon, and
having its genesis in a hard saying of
her motlier's.
"Was she strong enough to walk this
hedged-up path alone â single-hearted
enough to go on holding out against
her mother's urgings, against Orms-\
by's masterful wooing, against her
own unconquerable longing for a sure
anchorac in some safe haven of man
ful care and supervision; all this that
she miÂ«*ht continue to preserve her in
dependence and live the life which, de
spite its drawbacks, was yet her own'.'
There were times when she doubted
her resolution; and this first night of
the westward journey was one of
them. She had thought at one time
that she might be able to idealize
David Kent, but he had gone his way
to hew out his fortune, taking her up
slirrings of his ambition in. a purely
literal and selfish sense, so far as she
could determine. And now there was
Brookes Ormsby. She could by no
possibility idealize him. He was a
fixed fact, stubbornly asserted. Yet he
was a great hearted gentleman, un
spoiled by his millions, thoughtful al
ways of her comfort, generous, self
effacing. Just now, for example, when
hv had done all) he had seemed to
divine her wish to be alone and had
betaken himself to the smoking com
partment.-
Two sections away the inevitable
newly married pair posed unconscious
ly to point the moral for Miss Brent
wood. She marked the eagerly antici
pative solicitude of the boyish groom,
contrasting it now and then with
Onr.sby's less obtrusive attentions. It
was all very absurd and sentimental,
she thought; and yet she was not with
out a curious .heart-stirring of envy
provoked by the self-satisfied com
placency cf the bride.
"What had that chit uf a griÂ»l done to
earn her immunity from self-defend
lngs and the petty anxietie'S? Nothing,
Elinor decided; at least, nothing more
purposeful than the swimmer does
when he Jeis himself drift with the
current. None the less, the immunity
was hers, undeniably, palpably. For
the first time in her life Miss Brent
wocd found herself looking, with a lit
tle shudder of withdrawal and dismay,
down the possible vistaâ possible to
every unmarried woman of twenty
four â niilestoned by unbroken years of
spinsterhood and self-helpings.
The westward journey began at the
appointed hour in the evening with
the resourceful Ormsby in. command;
and when the outset-ing, In which she
had to sustain only the part of an
obedient automaton, was a fact accom
plished. Elinor settled back into the
pillowed corner of her sleeping-car sec
tion to enjoy the unwonted sensation of
being the one cared for instead of the
caretaker.
She had traveled more or less with
her mother and Penelope ever since
her father's death, ana was well used
to taking the helm. Experience and
the responsibilities had made her self
reliant, and her jesting boast that she
was a dependable young woman was
the simple truth. Yet to the most mod
ern of girl bachelors there may come
moments when the soul harks back to
the eternal-womanly, and the desire
to be petted and looked after and safe
conducted is stronger than the bachelor
conventions.
The Flcshpats of Egypt.
possible, I should like to meet your
train. One thing among the many the
past two years have denied me â the
only thing I have cared much about, I
think â is the sight of your face. I shall
be very happy if you will let me look
at you â just for the minute or two the
train may stop."
There was more of It; a good bit
more; but it was all guarded common
place, opening no window In the heart
of the man David Kent. Yet even in
the commonplace she found some faint
interlinings-of the change In him; not
a mere metamorphosis of the outward
man, as a new environment might
make, but a radical change, deep and
biting, like the action of a strong acid
upon a fine-grained metal. \
. She returned the 'letter to its envel
ope, and after locking up Gaston on the
time-table fell into a heart-stirring
reverie, with unseeing eye fixed on the
restful blackness of the night rushing
rearward past the car windows.
"He has forgotten." she said, with a
little lip-curl of disappointment. "He
thinks he ought to remember, and he
is trying;â trying because Grantham
to a boat's* length; had trimmed his
sails to the minutest starting of a
sheet. A glance at his watch and an
other at the time table gave him the
length of his respite. Six hours there
were; and a dining-car dinner* inter
vened. Those six hours and the din
ner, he decided, must win or lose the
race. . -
Picturing for ourselves, if we may,
how nine men out of ten would have
given place to panic ardor, turning a
possible victory, into a hopeless rout,
let us hold aloof and mark the general
ship of the tenth, who chances to be
the heaven-born.
For five of the six precious hours
Ormsby merely saw to it that Elinor
was judiciously marooned. Then the
dining-car was reopened and the even
ing meal was announced. Wating until
a sufficient number of passengers had
gone forward to insure a crowded car,
Ormsby let his party fall in with the
tail of the procession, and the inevit
able happened. Single â¢ seats only
could be had, and Elinor was compelled
to dine in solemn silence at a table
"I mean all that an honest man can
mean," he rejoined. "I have fought
like a soldier for standing-room in the
place you have assigned me;- I have
tried sincerely â and stupidly, you will
say â to be merely your friend, just the
best friend you ever had. But it's no
use. Coming or going, I shall always
be your lover."
"Please -'don't," she said, neither
coldly, nor warmly. "You are getting
over into the domain" of the very young
people when you say things like that."
'. It was an unpleasant thing to say,
and he was not beyond wincing a lit
tle. None the less, he would ntft be
turned aside.
"You'll overlook it in me if I've
pressed the thing too hard on the side
of sentiment, won't you? Apart from
the fact that I feel that way, I've been
"going on the supposition that you'd
like it, if you could only make up your
mind to like me." e
"I do like you," she admitted; "more
than any one I ' have ever known, I
think."
The drumming wheels and a long
drawn trumpet blast from the locomo
tive made a shield of sound to iso-
"This stationâ do you . know, the
name of. it?" "she asked.- fighting hard
for the self-control that usually came
so easily.
Ormsby consulted his watch.
"I am not quite sure. It ought to
beâ"
He brokÂ« off when he saw that sha
was no longer listening to him. There
was a stir in the forward vestibule,
and the porter came in with a hand
bag. At his heels was a man in a
rough weather boxcoat; a youngish
man. clean shaven and wind tanned to
a healthy bronze, with an eager face
and alert eyes that made an instant
inventory of the car and its comple
1 ment of passengers. So much Orms
by saw. Then Penelope stood â¢ up in
her nlace to greet the newcomer.
,"Wh'y, Mr. Kent!" she exclaimed.
"Are you really going on with us?
How nice of you!"
Elinor turned coolly upon her seat
mate, self-possession once more firmly
seated in the. saddle.
"Did you know Mr. Kent was going
to board the train here?" she asked
abruptly.
â¢ "Do you mean the gentleman Pene
lope has waylaid? I haven't the pleas
ure of his acquaintance. Will you in
troduce us?"
Kent had stood something in awe,
not especially of her personality, but
of her tongue, and had been forced
to acquiesce silently In Loring's sum
ming up of Elinor's mother as a
woman who had taken culture and
the humanizing amenities of the
broader life much as the granite of
her native hills takes polish â reluc
tantly, and without prejudice to its
inner granular structure.
"Elinor, you ought to be ashamed
to keep Brookes Ormsby dangling the
way you do," was her comment when
Elinor came back. "You are your
father's daughters, both of you; there
isn't a droo of the Grimkie blood in
either of you, I do believe."
Elinor was 6Ufliciently her father's
daughter to hold her peace under her
mother's reproaches; also, there was
enough of the Grimkie blood in her
veins to stiffen her in opposition when
the need arose. So she said nothing.
"Since your Uncle Ichabod made
such a desperate mess of that copper
business in Montana we have all been
next door to poverty, and you know
it," the mother went on. Irritated by
Elinor's silence. "I don't care so
much for myself; your father and I
began with nothing-, and I can go back
to nothing if necessary. But you
can't, and neither can Penelope; you'd
both starve. I should like to know
what Erookes Ormsby has done that
you can't tolerate him."
"It isn't anything he has done, or
failed to do." said Elinor, wearily.
"Please let's not go over it all again,
mother."
Mrs. Brentwood let that gun cool
while she fired another.
"I suppose he came to say good-by.
What is he going to do with himself
this winter?"
The temptation to equivocate for
pure perversity's sake was strong upon
Elinor, and she yielded to it.
"How should I know? He has the
Air.phritrite and the Florida coast,
h2sn't he?"
Mrs. Brentwood groaned.
"To think of the way he squanders
his money in sheer dissipation!" 6he
exclaimed. "Of course, he will take an
entire houreparty with him, as usual,
and the cost of that one cruise would
set you up in housekeeping."
Penelope laughed with a younger
daughter's license. She was a stat
uesque young woman with a pose, ripe
iips. flashing: white teeth, laughing
eyes with an imp of mischief in them,
and an exquisitely turned up nose that
â¢was neither the Brentwood, which was
severely classic, nor the Grimkie, which
was pure Puritan renaissance-.
"Which is to intimate that he won't
have money enough left to do it when
he comc-s back," the commented. "I
wish there, were some way of making
him believe he had to give me. what
lemains of his income after he has
rper.t a!l he can on the Florida cruise.
I'd wear" Worth gowns and be lapped
in luxury for the next ten years at the
very least."
"He isn't going to Florida this win
ter." said Elinor, repenting her. of the
Â¦mall quibble. * "He's going West"
il;s. Brentwood looked up sharply.
â¢â¢With tas?" she queried.
PeueJop- clasped her hands and tried
to look soulful.
"Oh, Ellic!" she said, "have you "
"No," Elinor retorted; "I have not."
Mrs. Brentwood wvas not indifferent
to the Ormsby millions; neither had
she forgotten a certain sentimental
summer at the f6ot of Old Croydon.
She was a thin-lipped little person,
plain spoken to the verse of unfriend
liness; a. woman in whom the rugged,
self-reliant Puritan strain had be
convs imiic-acidulous. And when the
Puritan stock degenerates in that di
rection it is apt to lack good judgment
on the business side and also the pas
sivity which smooths the way for in
competence in less assertive folk.
"I don't think anything of you that
1 ougin not to think. In that I am as
conscientious as even you could wish.
Good-by until this evening. I'll meet
you all at the statio^i."
As had come to be the regular order
of things, Elinor found herself under
fire when she went above stairs to
rejoin her mother and sister.
"Please don't think me ungrateful,"
the said, when she had thrown the
night-latch for him. "I don't mean
to be."
"We are not so easily frightened,"
Â£he asserted; adding, with a touch of
the austerity whieh waj her Puritan
birthright: "Nor Quite so conscience
less as you men.*!
"Conscience.' he repeated half ab
eently; "is there any room for such an
out-of-date thing in a. nation of success
fulhas? But seriously; you ought to
get rid of Western Pacific. There can
be no possible question of conscience
involved.'
"I don't agree with you." she retorted
Â¦with prompt decision. "If we were to
sell now it would be because we were
afraid it might prove to be a bad in
vestment. There fort, for the sake of a
presumably ignorant buyer, we have no
riffht to sell."
He smiled leniently.
"All' of \s hich goes to prove that you

But I mustn't keep you any longer

to the door.

don't know one route from another in
our own country'." she confessed. "But
at the western e::d of it we want to so
over the Western Pacific."
Ormsby knew the West by rail routes
cs one who travels much for time
killing: purposes.
"It's a rather roundabout cow-path,"
he objected. "The Overland Short Line
is a good bit more direct; not to men
tion the service, wliieh is a lot better."'
But Elinor bad made her small con
cession to David Kent's letter, and
she would not withdraw it. %
"Probably you don't own any West
ern Pacific stock." she suggested. "We
do; ajid we. mean to be loyal to our
Ealt." Â»
Onnsby laughed.
"I see Western Pacific lias gone down
a few points tinee the election of Gov
ernor I2ut_ks. 11 I had any, I'd wire my
bicker Vj sell."
"Do. It may come to a bit of quick
wiring when our chance arrives. You
know Loringâ Grantham Loring?"
"Passably welL I came across him
one summer in the mountains of Peru.
where he was managing a railroad. He
is a mighty good sort. I had mountain
fever, and he took me In and did for
me." -
"He is with us now." said David
Kent; "the newly appointed general
manager of the Western Pacific."
"Good!" scid the clubman. "I think
a lot *f him: he is an all-around de
pendable fellow, and plenty capable.
"By Jove! that's decent." said Orms
by, heartily. "You are a friend worth
having, Mr. Kent. But which Inside'
do you mean â tha railroad or tha
political?"
"Oh, the railroad, of course. And
while I think of it, nay office wffl bÂ» In
the Quintard Building; and youâ I sup
pose you will put up at tha Welling
ton?"
"For the present, we shall. It is Mrs.
Brentwood's notion to take a furnished
house later on for herself and daugh
ters, if she can find one. I'll keep in
touch with you."
"You are likely to have good hunting
this winter, Mr. Kent. It hasn't begun
yet, I take it?"
"Oh, no; the Assembly does not con
vene for a fortnight, and nobody short
of an inspired prophet can foretell
what legislation will be sprung. But
one thing 13 safe to count on; the
leaders are out for spoils. They mean
to rob somebody, and, if my guess is
worth anything, they are sharp enough
to try to get their schemes legalized by
having enabling laws passed by the
Assembly."
"Um.'^said the eastern man. Then
he took the measure of his companion
in a shrewd overlook. "You axÂ© the
man on the ground, Mr. Kent, and I'll
ask a straightforward question. If
you had a friend owning stock in one
of the involved railways, what would
you advise?"
Kent smiled.
"We needn't make it a hypothetical
case. If I had the right to advise Mrs.
Brentwood and her daughters, I should
counsel them to -<t tight in thÂ» boat
for the present."
"Would you? But Western Paciflo
has gone off several points already."
"I know It has; and unfortunately,
Mrs. Brentwood bought In at the top
of the market. That is why I counsel
delay. If she sells now, she is sura
to lose. If she holds on, thera is an
even chance for a spasmodio upward
reaction before worse things happen."
"Perhaps: you know more about th*
probabilities than I pretend to. But
on the other hand, she may losa mora
if she holds on."
Kent bit deep into his cigar.
"We must see to it that she doesn't
lose, Mr. Ormsby."
The clubman laughed broadly.
"Isn't that a good bit like saying
that the shallop must sea to it that tha
wind doesn't blow too hard for it?"
"Possibly. But in the sorriest wrack
there is usually some small chanca for
salvage. I understand Mrs. Brent
wood's holding 13 not very. large?"
"A block of some three thousand
shares, held Jointly by her and her two
daughters, I believe."
."Exactly: not enough -to excite any
body's cupidity; and yet enough to
turn the scale If there should ever ha
a fight for a majority control.**
"There is no such fight in prospect,
is there?"
"No; not that I know of. But I was
thinking of the possibilities. If a
smash comes there will be a good deal
of horse-swapping in the middle of tha
stream â buying up of depressed stocks
by people who need the lines worse
than the original owners do."
"I see," said Ormsby. "Then you
would council delay?"
"I should; and I'll go a step farther.
I am on the Inside, In a way, and any
bint I can give you for Missâ for Mrs.
Brentwood's benefit shall be promptly
forthcoming."
"I may as well confess that I am not
entirely an unprejudiced observer," ha
admitted. "For one thing, I am in the
legal department of one ot the best
hated of the railroads; and for another.
Governor Bucks, Meigs, the Attorney
General, and Hendrlcks, the new Sec
retary of State, are men whom I know
as, it is safe to say, the general publio
doesn't know them. If I could be sure
that these three men are going to bÂ»
able to control their own party major
ity In the Assembly I should take the
first train East and make my fortune
selling tips in Wall street."
"You put it graphically. Then the
BucksMdea is likely to prove a disturb
ing element on 'Change?"
"It isâ always providing It can dom
inate its own majority. But this is by
no means certain. The political earth
quake is essentially a popular protest
against hard conditions brought about.
as the voters seem to believe, by the
oppression of tha alien corporations
and extortionate railroad rates. Yet
there are plenty of steady-going, con
servative men in the movement â men
who have no present Idea of revolu
tionizing things. Marston, tha Lieuten
ant Governor, is one of that kind. It
all defends on whether these men will
allow themselves to be whipped into
line by the leaders, who, I am very
well convinced, are a set of conscience
less demagogues, fighting . solely for
their own hand."
Ormsby codded again.
Kent blew a series of smoke rings
and watched them rise to becoxna a
part of the stratified tobacco cloud
overhead before replying.
"Of course, there have been all sorts
of rumors Eastâ 'bull' prophecies that
the triumph of the new party means
Â«n era of unexampled prosperity for
the State â and by consequence for
Western stocks: 'bear* growllngs that
things are sure to go to the bow-wows
under the Bucks regime. What do you
think of it?"
"Then the railroads and the corpora
tions are not primarily to blame?" said
Ormsby.
"Oh, no. Corporations here, as else
where, are looking out for the present
dollar, but if the country were gener
ally prosperous the people would pay
the tax carelessly, as they do In the
older sections. With us it has been a
sort of Donnybrook fair â the agricul
tural voter has shillalahed the head he
could reach most easily."
The New Yorker nodded. His mil
lions were solidly placed, and he took
no more than a sportsman's interest In
the fluctuations of the stock market.
ably settled in the men's room and
Kent produced his pipe and tobacco
pouch. "I prefer the pipe myself, for a
steady thing; but at this time of night
a light Castilla fits me pretty welL Try
one?" tendering his cigar case.
Fighting shrewdly against a natural
prompting to regard Ormsby as a
hereditary enemy, Kent forced himself
to be neighborly.
"I don't mind," he said, returning the
pipe to its case. And when the Hava
nas were well alight and the talk had
circled down upon the political situa
tion In the State he was able to bear
his part with a fair exterior, giving
Ormsby an impressionistic outline- of
the late campaign and the conditions
that had made the sweeping triumph of
the People's party possible.
"We have been coming to It steadily
through the last administration, and a
part of the preceding one," he ex
plained. "Last year the drought cut
the cereals in half, and the country
was too new to stand It without
borrowing. There was little local capi
tal, and the eastern article was hun
gry, taking all the Interest the law
allows, and as much more aa It could
get. This year the crop broke all rec
ords for abundance, but the price Is
down and the railroads, trying to re
coup for two bad years, have stiffened
the freight rates. The net result is our
political overturn."
CHAPTER IV.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
"To be entirely consistent, I suppose
I ought to," he confessed, wondering
if his. throw had failed. "Do you want
me to jjo?"
"I have been alone all the afternoon:
I can endure it a little while longer, I
presume."
Ormsby permitted himself a single
heart-throb of exultation. He had de
liberately gone about to break down her
poise, her only barrier of defense, and
it began to look as. if he had succeeded.
"I couldn't help it, you . know," he
said, catchmg his. cue swiftly. "There
are times when I'm obliged to keep
away from youâ times when every fiber
of me rebels against the restraints of
the false position you have thrust, me
into. When I'm taken that way I don't
dare play with the fire."
"I wish I could know-how much you
mean by that," she said . musingly.'
Deep down in her heart she knew she
was as far as ever from loving this
man; but his love, or the insistent
urging of It, was like a strong: current
drifting her whither she would not go.David Kent was silent for the strid
ing of half a square. The New Eng
land conscience dies hard, and while it
lives it is given to drawing sharp lines
on all the boundaries of culpability.
Kent ended by taking the matter in
debate violently out of the domain of
ethics and standing it upon the ground
of expediency.
"It will cost too much. You would
have to bid highâ not to overcome his
scruples, for he has none; but to satisfy
his greed â which is abnormal. And,
besides, he has his pose to defend. If
he can sse his way clear to a harvest
of extortions under the law. he will
probably turn you down â and will
make it hot for you later on in the
name of outraged virtue."
Harnwicke's laugh was cynical.
"He and his little clique don't own
the earth in fee simple. Perhaps we
shall be able to make them grasp that
idea before we are through with them.
We have had this fight on in other
States. Would ten thousand be likely
to satisfy him?"
"No," said Kent. "If you add another
cipher. It- might."
"A hundred thousand is a pot of
money. I take it for granted the West
ern Pacific will stand its pro-rate?"
The New England conscience bucked
again, and Kent made his first open
protest against the methods of the de
moralizers.
"I am not in a position to say: I
should advise against it. Unofficially,
I think I can speak for Loring and the
Boston people. We are not more saint
ly than* other folk, perhaps; and we are
not in the railroad business for health
or pleasure. But I fancy the Advisory
Board would draw the line at bribing
a Governor â at any rate, I hope it
would."
"Rot!" said Harnwicke. And then:
"You'll reap the benefits with other
interstate interests; you'll have to
come in. 4 '
Kent heÂ«Uated,- but not now on the
ground of the principle to be de
fended.
"That brings in a question which I
'am not competent to decide. Loring
is your man. You will call a con
ference of the 'powers,' I take it?"
"It is already called. I sent Ather
ton out to notify everybody as soon
as the trap wag sj>rung in the House.
We meet in the ordinary at the Canie
loL. You'll be there?"
"A little later â If Loring wants me.
I have some telephoning to do before
this thing gets on the wires."
They parted at the entrance to the
Camelot Club and Kent went two
squares farther on to the Wellington.
Ormsby had not yet returned and
./-.. Â¦--.Â¦-â¢"Â¦ "
Kent shrugged.
"There isn't any douht about his pur
chasability. But I confess I don't quite
see how you will go about it."
"Never mind that part of it; just
leave the ways and means with those
of us who have riper experience â and
fewer hamperings. perhapsâ than you
have. Your share in it is to tell us how
big: a bid we must make. As I say, you
know the man."
Harnwicke turned a cold eye on his
companion as they strode along. He
was of the square-set, plain-spoken,
aggressive type â a finished product of
the modern school of business lawyers.
"I don't understand that you are
raising the question of ethics at this
stage of the game, do I?" he remarked.
Kent fired up a little.
"And If I am?" he retorted.
"I should say you had missed your
calling. It is baldly a question of busi
ness-^or rather of self-preservation. We
needn't mince matters among our
selves. If Bucks is for. sale, we buy
him."
"Of course, we all know that. But
we don't know the particular object
yet.' Do they need the new law in their
business as a source of revenue? Or
do they want to be hired to kill it?
In other words, does Bucks want a
lump sum for a veto? You know the
man better than any of us."
"By Jove!" said Kent. "Do you mean
to say you would buy the Governor of
a State?"
"It's his own measure. I have proof
positive that he and Meigs and Hen
dricks drafted It. And all this tine
haired engineering to-night was his
or Meigs'." ,
Harnwicke thought not, being of the
opinion that the vested interests would
never say die until they were quite
dead. As assistant counsel for the
Overland Short Line he was in some
sense the dean of the corps of observa
tion, and could speak with authority.
"There is one chance left for us this
side of the courts," he went on; "and
now that I think of it you are the man
to say how much of a chance it is.
The bill still lacks the Governor's sig
nature."
Kent shook his head.
Kent's time from Alameda square
to the capitol was the quickest a flog
ged cab horse could make, but he might
have snared the horse and saved the
double fee. On the broad steps of the
â¢south portico he, uprushins three at a
bound, met the advance guard of the
gallery contingent down coming. The
House had adjourned.
. "One minute, Harnwicke!" he gasped,
falling upon the first member of the
corporations' lobby he could identify
in the throng. "What's been done?"
"They've taken a fall out of us," was
the brusque reply. "House bill 29
was reported by the Committee on
Judiciary and rushed through after you
left. tromebody engineered it to the
paring of a finger nail; bare quorum
to act; members who might have fili
bustered weeded out on one pretext or
another; to a man; pages all excused
and nobody heTe with the privilege of,
the floor. It was as neat a piece of
gag work as I ever hope to see if I
live to be a hundred."
Kent turned about and joined the
tewnward dispersal with his informant.
"Well, I suppose that settles it defi
nitely; at least, until we can test its
constitutionality in the courts," he
said.
The Sentimentalists.
C1IAPTHR VII.
"House bill 29 Is much too dead to
burj'." was the reassuring re
joinder. "The committee is ours, and
the bill will not be heard of again at
this session. If that is all you are
holding on for "
Â»They passed out of earshot, and Kent
folded his newspaper absently. House
bill 29 had been the one measure
touching the sensitive "vested
interests"; the one measure for the
suppression of which the corporation's
lobby had felt called on to take steps.
It was an omnibus bill put forth as a
substitute for the existing law defining
the status of foreign corporations. It
had originated In the Governor's office
âa fact which Kent had ferreted out
Â¦within twenty-four hours of its first
readingâ and for that reason he had
procured a printed copy, searching it
diligently for the hidden menace he
was sure it embodied.
When the search proved fruitless he
had seen the bill pass the House by a
safe majority, had followed it to the
Senate, and in a cunningly worded
amendment tacked on in the upper
house had found what he was seeking.
Under the existing law foreign corpora
tions -were subject to State supervision,
and were dealt with as presumably un
friendly aliens. But the Senate amend
ment to House bill 29 fairly
swept the interstate corporations, as
such, out of existence, by making it
obligatory upon them to acquire the
standing of. local corporations. Char
ters were to be refiled with the Secre
tary of State; resident directories and
operating headquarters were to be es
tablished within the boundaries and
jurisdiction of the State; In short, the
State proposed, by the terms of the
new law, to deal only with creature? of
Its own creation.
Kent saw, or thought he saw, the
fine hand of the junta in all this. It
was a still hunt in which the longest
way around was the shortest way
home. Like all new-country codes, the
organic law of the State favored local
corporations, and it might be argued
that a bill placing the foreign com
panies on a purely local footing was
an unmixed blessing to the aliens. But,
on the other hand, an unprincipled ex
ecutive might easily make the new law
an engine of extortion. To go no fur
ther into the matter than the required
refiling of charters: the State-constitu
tion gave the Secretary of State quasi
judicial powers; It was within his
province to pass upon the applications
for chartered rights and to deny them
"No," said the other. "If it -wasn't
for House bill 29, I'd go to-night. They
â¢will adjourn to-merrow ot Monday."
David Kent was of this silent army
of observation, doing watchdog duty
fcr the Western Pacific; thankful
enough, if the truth be told, to have a
thing to do which kept him from dwell
ing overmuch upon the wreck of his
hopes. But in the closing days of the
session, when a dispatchful Assembly,
anxious to be quit of its task, had gone
into night 'sittings, the anodyne drug
of work began to lose its effect.
The Brentwoods had taken furnished
apartments in Tejon avenue, two
squares from the capitol, and Kent
had called no oftener than good breed
ing prescribed. Yet their accessibility
and his unconquerable desire to sear
his wound' In the flame that caused it
were constant temptations and he was
battling with them for the hundredth
time on the Friday night when he sat
In the House gallery listening to a per
functory debate which concerned itself
with a bill touching State waterways.
"Heavens! This thing is getting to
be little short of deadly!" fumed Cren
shawe. his right hand neighbor, who
v.as also a member of the corps of ob
servation.
"I'm going to the club for a game
of pool. Won't you come along?"
Kent nodded and left his seat with
the bored one. But in the great ro
tunda he changed his mind.
"You'll find plenty of better players
than I am at the club," he said in ex
tenuation. "I think I'll smoke a whiff
or two here and go back. Thev can't
hold on much longer for to-night."
Five minutes later, when he had
lighted a cigar and was glancing over
the evening paper, two other members
of the corporation committee of safety
came down from the Senate gallery
and stopped opposite Kent's pillar to
struggle into their overcoaots.
"It's precisely as I wrote our people
two weeks ago â a timidity scare, pure
and simple," one of them was saying.
"I've a mind to start home to-morrow.
There is nothing doing here, or going
to be done."
The session, the shortest in the his
tory of the State, and thus far the least
eventful, was nearihg its close, and the
alarmists who had prophesied evil and
evil only of the "Populist" victory were
fust losing credit with the men of their
own camp and with the country at
large.
After the orthodox strife over the
speakership of the House, and the
equally orthodox wrangle over contest
ed seats, the State Assembly had set
tled down to routine business, dispatch
ing it with such unheard-of celerity as
to win columns of approval from the
State press as a whole, thougti there
were not wanting a few radical editors
to raise the ante-e!ection cry of reform
and to ask pointedly when it was to
begin.
Notwithstanding the lack of alarms,
however, the six weeks had been a pe
riod of unceasing vigilance on the part
of the interests which were supposed to
be in jeopardy. Every alien corpora
tion owning property and doing busi
ness in the State had its own quota of
watchful defenders on the ground; men
who came and went In the lobbies of
the capitol, in the visitors' galleries,
at the receptions; men who said lit
tle, but who saw and heard all things
down to the small talk of the corridors
end the clubs, and the gossip- of the
hotel rotundas.
Of the Slaking of Laws.
"Tell me what you mean in one
word. Miss Van Brock. Don't those
fellows intend to stay bought?"
She smiled pityingly.
* "You are very young. Mr. David â
or very honest. Supposing those 'fel
lows,' a3 you dub the honorable mem
bers of the Committee on Judiciary,
had a little plan of their own; a plan
suggested by the readiness of certain
of tneir opponents to rush into print
vifh stntements which might derange
things?" â¢ ; .
"I am supposing it with all my
might."
"That is right: we are only sup
.posing, you mult remember. We
may suppose their idea was to let
the excitement about the amend
ed bill die. down; to let people
generally, and one fiercely honest
young corporation attorney in particu
lar, have time to forget that there was
such a thing as House bill 29.
And in ~ such a suppositional case,
how much would they be surprised and
how they would laugh in their sleeves
if some ore came along and paid them
handsomely lor doing precisely what
they meant to do."
David Kent's smile was almost fero
cious.
"My argument is as good now as it
was in the beginning: they have yet
to reckon with the man who will dare
tc- expose them."
She turned from him and spoke to
the footman at the door.
"Thomas, fetch M.r. Kent's coat arid
hat from the dressing-room." And then
to Kent, in the tone she might have
used in telling him of the latast breezi
ness of the mem,ber from the Rio Blan
cc-: "I remember now what it was that
I wanted to tell you. .While you have
been trying to find Mr. Ormsby, the
Committee on Judiciary. has been re
porting the long-lost House bill 23,
If you hurry you may be . .in
time to see it passedâ it .will doubtless
ga through without any tiresome de
bate. But you will hardly have time
to obstruct it by arousing public senti
ment through the newspapers."
David Kent shook the light touch of
her hand from his arm and set his
teeth hard upon a word hot from the
furnace of righteous indignation. Fot
They had reached the dimly lighted
front vestibule, and her hand was still
on his arm.
"I was interested in it," he ad
mitted, correcting the present to the
past tense.
"But after it went to the House
Committee on Judiciary yo.u left it to
more skillful or perhaps we'd better
say to less scrupulous hands?"
"I believe you are a witch. Is there
anything you don't know?"
"Plenty of things. For example, I
don't exactly know how much it cost
our good friends of the 'vested inter
ests' to have that bill mislaid in the
committee-room. But I do know
they made a very foolish bargain."
"Beyond all doubt a most demoral
izing bargain, which, to say the best
of it. was only a choice between two
evils. But why foolish?"
' "Because â well, because mislaid
things have a way of turning up un
expectedly, you know, and â "
He stopped her in a sudden gust of
feverish excitement.
"Not whqlly; only partly. You said
this matter of Mr. Ormsby's concerned
Miss Brentwood â in a way â didn't
you?"
"You will have your pound of flesh
entire, won't you? The stock is -hers,
and her mother's and sister's. I want
Ormsby to persuade them to sell.
They'll listen to him. That is all; all
the all."
"Of course," she said, airily. "How
simple of me not to. have been able
to add it up without your help. 1
saw the quotation in the evening pa
per; and I know, perhaps, better
than you do. the need for haste. Must
you go now?" She had taken his
arm and was edging him through the
press in Jhe parlors toward the en
trance 'hall.
"You haven't naid me yet," he ob
jected.
"No; I'm trying to remember. Oh,
yes; I have it now. Wasn't some
one telling me that you were interest
ed in House bill 29?"
"And Mr. Ormsby has some to sell?
I wish I had. Do you know what I'd
do?" She drew closer and laid a hand
on his arm. "I'd sell â by wire â to
night; at least, I'd make sure that my
telegram would be the first thing my
broker would lay his hands on in the
morning.'
"On general principles, . I suppose,
so should I, and for. the same rerfson.
But have I succeeded in reminding
you of that thing you were going to
tell me?"
"I wonder if you hold everybody up
like this," he laughed. "But I don't
mind telling you. .Western Ppciflc pre
ferred has gone to fifty-eight and a

"Why. yes; they all came to take
leave just a few moments after you
left. me. I thought of telling Mr. Orms

: "Miss Van Brock! What have you
done? T must go at once."
"Really? I am complimented. But
if you must, you must. I suppose. I
had something to tell you â something
of Importance; but I can't remember
what it was now. I never can remem
ber things in the hurry of leave-tak
ings."
As we have intimated, Kent had
hitherto found Miss Portia's con
fidences exceedingly helpful in a busi
ness way, and he hesitated. "Tell me,"
he begged.
"No. I can't remember it: I doubt
if I shall ever remember it unless you
can remind me by telling me why you
are so desperately anxious to find Mr.
Ormsby."
stock even at an advance; might re
quire time, at least. And time, with a
Bucks majority tinkering with corpor
ate rights in the Assembly, might well
be precious.
"Forgive me if I tell Ormsby first."
he pleaded. "Afterward, if you care to
know, you shall."
Miss Van Brock let him go at that,
but now the way to the smoking den
en the floor above was hedged up. He
did battle with the polite requirements,
as a man must: shaking hands or ex
changing a word with one and another
of the obstvuetors only as he had to.
None the less, when he had finally
wrought his way to tHe smoking-room
Ormsby had eluded him again.
He went back to the parlors, wonder
ing how he had mi?sed the clubman.
In tho middle room of the suite he.
found Portia chatting with Marston,
the Lieutenant Governor; and a young
woman in the smartest of reception
gowns had succeeded to Elinor's place
at the piano.
"You found him?" queried the hos
tess, excusing herself to the tall,
saturnine man who had shared the
honors at the head of the People's
party ticket with Jasper G. Bucks,
"No," said Kent. "Have you seen
him?"
a moment he fully believed she was in
league with the junta; that she had
been purposely holding him in talk
while the very seconds were priceless.
She' saw the scornful w.rath in his
eyes and turned it aside with a swift
denial.
"Xo, David; I didn't do that ' she
said, speaking to his inmost thought.
"If there had been anything you could
dc- â the smallest shadow of a chance
for you â I should have sent you flying
at the rirst word. But there wasn't;
it was all too well arrangedâ "
But he had snatched coat and hat
from the waitine Thomas and was run
ning like a madman for the nearest
cabstand.
There was a crush In the ample man
sion In Alameda Square, as there al
ways was at Miss Van Brock's "open
evenings," and when Kent came down
from the cloakroom he had to Inch his
way by littles through the crowded
reception parlors in the search for the
Brentwood party. It was unsuccessful
at first; but later, catching a glimpse
of Elinor at the piano, and another
of Penelope Inducting an up-country
legislator Into the mysteries of social
small talk, he breathed freer. His hap
hazard guess had hit the mark, and
the finding of Ormsby was now only a
question of moments.
It was Miss Van Brock herself who
told him where to look for the club
manâthough not at his first asking.
"You did come, then," she said, giv
ing her hand with a frank little smile
of welcome. "Some one said you were
. not going to be frivolous any more, and
I wondered'if you would take it out on
me. Have you been at the night ses
sion?" \
' "Yes; at what you and your frivoli
ties have left' of it. A good third of
the Solons seem to be sitting in per-
It was the housemaid that answered
his ring at the door of the Brentwood
apartments. She was a Swede, a recent
importation; hence Kent learned noth
ing beyond the bare fact that the la
dies had gone out. "With Mr. Orms
by?" he asked.
"Yaas; Aye tank it vill pee dat yen
mans."
The pursuer took the road again,
rather unhopefully. There were a
dozen places where Ormsby might
have taken his charges. Among them
there was the legislative reception at
Portia Van Brock's. Kent flipped a
figurative coin, and gave the order for
Alameda Square. The reception there
was perhaps the least unlikely place of
the dozen.
He was no more than fashion
ably late at the Van Brock house,
and fortunately he was able to reckon
himself among the chosen few for
whom Miss Portia's door swung on hos
pitable hinges at all hours. Lorinrr
had known her in Washington,
and he had stood sponsor for
Kent In the first week of the exile's
residence at the capital. Thereafter she
had taken Kent up on his own account,
and by now he was deep in her debt.
For one thing, she had set the fashion
in the matter of legislative receptions
â her detractors, knowing nothing
whatever about it, hinted that she had
been an amateur social lobbyist in
Washington, playing the game for the
pure zest of It â and at these functions
Kent had learned many thinge per
tinent to his purpose as a watch dog
for the railroad company and legal ad
viser to his chief â things not named
openly on the floor of the House or of
the Senate chamber.
The measure as amended had passed
the Senate without debate and had
gone back to the House. Here, after
the second readme, and in the very
hour when the Argus editorial was
getting itself cast in the linotypes,
there was a hitch, ?he member from
the Rio Blanco, favoring the measure
in all its parts, and fearful only lest
corporation gold might find a technical
flaw in it, moved that it be referred to
tse Committee un Judiciary for a re
port on its constitutionality; and, ac
cordin.gly to the Committee on Judici
ary it had gone. â¢
Kent recalled the , passing of the
crisis, remembering how he had hast
ened to telephone the Argus editor to
kill the expose at the last moment. The
incident was now a month in the past,
and the committee had not yet report
ed; would never report, Kent imagined.
He knew the personnel of the Commit
tee on Judiciary; knew * that at
least three members ot. it were down
on the list, made up at the beginning of
the session by his colleagues in the
army of observation, as â¢"approacha
bles." Also, he knew by interence at
least, that these three men had been
approached, not without success, and
that House bill 29, with its fee-gather
ing amendment, was tafely shelved.
"It's an ill-smelling muckheap!" he
frowned, recalling the incidents of the
crisis at the suggestion let fall by the
two outgoing lobbyists. "And so much
of this dog watch as isn't sickeningly
demoralizing is deadly dull, as Cren
shawe puts it. If I had anywhere to go,
I'd cut (.he galleries for to-night."
He was returning the newspaper to
his pocket when it occurred to him
that his object in buying it had been
to note the stock quotations; a daily
duty which, for Elinor's sake, he had
never omitted. Whereupon he re
opened it and ran his eye down the
lists. There was a decided upward ten
dency in Westerns. Overland Short
Line had gained two points; and West
ern Pacific
He held the paper under the nearest
electric globe to make sure; Western
l J acilic, preferred, was quoted at fifty
eight and a half, which was one point
and a half above the Brentwood pur
chase price.
One minute later an excited life-saver
was shut In the box of the public tele
phone, gritting his teeth at the inanity
of the central operator who insisted on
giving him "A-1224" instead of "A
1234," the Hotel Wellington.
"No, no! Can't you understand? I
want twelve-thirty-four; one. two,
three, four; the Hotel Wellington."
There was more skirling of bells, an
other nerve-trying wait, and at last the
clerk of the hotel answered.
"What name did you say? Oh, it's
you. is it, Mr. Kent? Ormsby? Mr.
Brookes Ormsby? No, he isn't here;
he went out about two minutes aero.
What's that you say? Damn? Well,
I'm sorry, too. No message that I can
take? All right. Good-by."
This was the beginning. For the
middle part Kent burst out of the tele
phone-box and took the .nearest short
cut through the capitol grounds for the
street-car corner. At a quarter of nine
he was croEs-questioning the clerk face
to fa\ce in the lobby of the Wellington.
There was little more to be learned
about 'Ormsby. The clubman had left
his key and gone out. He was in even
ing dress, and had taken a cab at the
hotel entrance. â¢
Kent dashed across to his rooms, and.
in a feverish race against time, made
himself fit to chase a man In evening
dress. There was no car In sight when
he came down, and he, too. took a cab
with an explosive order to the driver:
"124 Tejon Avenue, and be quick about
Kent put two and two together, saw
the wide door of exactions which might
be opened, and passed the word of
warning among his associates; after
which he had watched the course of
the amended House bill 29 with interest
sharp-set, planning meanwhile with
Hildreth, the. editor of the Daily Ar
gus, an expose which should make
plain the Immense possibilities for cor
ruption opened up by the proposed
law; a journalistic salvo of publicity
to be tired as a last resort.
if the question pro bono publico were
involved.
CHATTER VI.
I'm glad to know he has caught on
higher up."
The locomotive whistle was droning
again, and a dodging procession of red
eyed switch-lights flicked past the
windows. Kent stood up and flung
away the stump of his cigar.
"The capital," he announced. "I'll go
back with you and help out with the
shawl-strap things." And In the vesti
bule he added: "I spoke of Loring be
cause he will be with us in anything
we have to do In Mrs. Brentwood's be
half. Look him up when you have
timeâ fourth floor of the Quintard."
She rose and stood beside him â a
bewitching figure of a woman who
knew her part in the human comedy
and played it well.
"Is it wise, David?" she asked softly.
"I am not denying the possibilities;
you might come between them if you
should try â I'm rather afraid you
could. But yo,u mustn't, you know;
it's too late. You've marred her, be
tween you; or rather that convention,
which makes a woman deaf, blind and
dumb until a man has fairly com
mitted himself, has marred t her. For
your sake she can never be quite all
she ought to be to him â for his sake
&he could never be quite {he same to
you." . Â¦' .
He drew apart from her, frowning.
"If I should say that I don't fully
understand what you mean?" he re
joined. 'â¢Â¦'
"I should retort by saying something
extremely uncomplimentary aboutyour
lack of perspicacity," she cut in ma
liciously.
"I beg pardon," he said, a little
stiffly. "You are laboring under an
entirely wrong impression. What I
have to say to Mr. Brookes Ormsby
does not remotely concern the matter
you touch upon. It's an affair of the
Stock Exchange."
"As if I didn't- know!" she coun
tered. "You merely reminded me of
the other thing. But if it is only a
business secret you may as well tell me
all about it at first hands. Some one
is sure to tell me sooner or later."
Now David Kent was growing im
patient. Down in the inner depths of
him he was perBuaded that Ormsby
might have difficulty in inducing Mrs
Brentwood to sell her Western Pacific
"He is in the smoking-room -with
five or six other tobacco misanthropes.
What do you want of him?"
"I want to say two words in his ear:
after which I shall vanish and make
room for my f betters."
Miss Van Brock was gazing stead
fastly at the impassioned face lighted
by the piano candles.
, "Is it about Miss Brentwood?" she
asked abruptly.
"In a wayâ yes," he confessed.
Kent was 'thinking of Lorlng's re
countal as he stood lookins down on
her. Other women were younger â
and with features more conventional
ly beautiful; Kent could find a .round
dozen within easy eye reach, to say
nothing of the calm-eyed, queenly im
provisatrice at the piano â his con
stant standard of all womanly charm
and grace. Unconsciously he fell to
comparing the two, his hostess and
his love, andÂ» was brought back to
things present by a sharp reminder
from Portia. .
"Stop looking at Miss Brentwood
that way, Mr. David. She is not for
you, and you are keeping me wait
ing."
He smiled down on her.
"it is the law of compensation. I
fancy you have kept many a man
waiting, and will keep many another."
There was a little tang of bitterness
in her* laugh.
"You remind me of the time when I
went home from school â oh, years and
years ago. Old Chloe â she was my
black mammy, you know â had a
grown daughter of her own, and her
effort to dispose of her 'M'rand' was a
standing joke In the family. In an
swer to my stereotyped question she
stood back and folded her arms. 'Naw,
honey; dat M'randy ain't ma-ied yit.
She gwine be des lak you; look pretty,
and say. Howdy! Misteh Jawnson, an'
go 'long by awn turrer side de road.' "
"A .very pretty little, fable," ' said
Kent. "And the moral?"
"Is that I amuse myself with you â
ali of you; and in your turn you make
use of me- â or you think you do. Of
what use can I be to Mr. David Kent
this evening?"
"See how you misjudge me!" he pro
tested. "My errand here to-night is
purely charitable, which brings me
bnck to Ormsby â did you say you
could tell me where to look for him?"
manence in Alameda Square.
" 'Solc-ns,' she repeated. "That re
calls Editor Brownlow's little joke â
only he didn't mean It. He wrote of
them as 'Solons,' but the printer got it
'solans.' The member from Caliente
read the article and the word stuck in
his mind. In an unhappy hour he asked
Colonel Mack's boyâ Harry, the irre
pressible, you know â to look it up for
him. Harry did it, and, of course, took
the- most public occasion he could find
to hand in his answer. 'It's geese, Mr.
Hackett!' he announced* triumphantly,
and after we were all through laugh
ing at him the member from the warm
place turned it just as neatly as a vet
eran. 'Well, I'm Hackett,' he said."
David Kent .laughed, as he was in
duty bound, but he still had Ormsby
on his mind.
"I see you have Mrs. Brentwood and
her daughters here â can you tell me
where I can find Mr. Brookes Orms
by?"
"I suppose I could if I should try.
But you mustn't hurry me. There is
a vacant corner in that davenport be
yond the piano; please put me there
and fetch me an ice. I'll wait for you."
He did as he was bidden and when
she was served he stood over her,
wondering, as" other men had won
dered, what was' the precise secret of
her charm. Loring had told him Miss
Van Brock's story. She was Southern
born, the, only child of a somewhat
ill considered match between a
young California lawyer, wire-pull
ing in the national capital in the in
terest of the Central Pacific Railroad,
and a Virginia belle tasting the de-
M^hts of h^r -first winter in Wash
ington. ' â¢
Later the young lawyer's State, or
life employers, had sent him to Con
gress, and Portia, left motherless in
her middle childhood,, had grown, up
in an atmosphere of statecraft, or
what passes for such, in an era of
frank commercialism. Inheriting her
mother's rare 'beauty of face and
form and uniting with it a sympathet
ic gift in grasp of detail, political and
other, she soon became her father's
confidante and loyal partisan, taking
the place, as a daughter might, of the
ambitious .young wife and mother,
who had set her heart on seeing the
Van Brock name on the roll of the
United States Senate.
Rensselaer Van Brock had died be
fore the Senatorial dream could be
realized, but not before he -had, made
a sufficient number of lucky invest
ments to leave his daughter the ar
bitress of her own future. What that
future should be not even Loring
could guess.. Since her father's death
Miss Van Brock had been a citizen of
the .world. With a widowed aunt for
the shadowiest of chaperons she had
drifted with the tide of inclination,
coming finally to rest in the Western
capital for no better reason, perhaps,
than that some portion of her interest
bearing securities were emblazoned
with the great seal of this particular
Western State.
1'enflope "arranged" It. not without
another added pang of curiosity,
whereupon David Kent found himself
the rather embarrassed third of a
silent trio gathered about the embers
of the sitting-room fire.
"Of course, you'll come. You a"re Just
.the man I'll need to back me up. I
shan't shirk; I'll take the mother into
the library and break the ice. while you
are squaring things with the youns
women. Penelope won't care the snap
of her finger either way; but- Elinor
has some notions that you are fitter to
tope with than I am. After, if you
can give me a lift with Mrs. Hepzibah,
I'll call you in. Come on; it's getting
pretty late to pro visiting."
â¢ Kent yielded reluctantly, and they
took a car for the sake of speed. It was
Penelope who opened the door for
them at 124 Tejon avenue, and Ormstv
made It easy for his coadjutor, as he
had promised.
"I want to see your mother in the
library for a few minutes." he began.
"Will you arrange it, and take care of
Mr. Kent until I come for him?"
"I'm not sure just how well you
know Mrs. Hepzibah Brentwood." he
demurred: "but it will be quite like her
to balk. Don't you think you'd better
go along? You are the company's at
torney, and your opinion ought ,to
carry some* weight."
David Kent thought not; but a cau
tious diplomatist, having got the idea
well into the back part of his head, was
not to be denied.
"No. I don't understand anything.
For goodnes sake, find Mr. Ormsby
and make him run! This is perfectly
dreadful!"
"Isn't it? And I'm awfully sorry.
Good-by."
Kent hung up the receiver, and when
he was asking a second time at the
clerk's desk for the missing man.
Ormsby came In to answer for himself.
Whereupon the crisis was outlined to
him in brief phrase, and he rose to the
occasion, though not without a grim
ace.
"I know, and I'd like to tell you.
But I am using the public telephone
here at the Wellington and â Oh.
damn!" Central had cut him out and
it was some minutes before the con
nection was switched in again.
"Is that you. Miss Penelope? All
right; I wasn't quite through. When
Ormsby comes, you must do as he tel!s
you to, and you and Miss Elinor must
help him convince your mother. Do
you understand?"
"I may have to if I can't find Orms
by. Please don't let your mother go
to bed until you have heard from one
or the other of us. Did you get that?"
"Ye-es; but I should like to know
more â a great deal more."
"Xo, no; it's nothing of that kind.
I'll send Ormsby out and he will tell
you all about it."
"Can't you come yourself?"
"I guess I'm a little excited." said
Kent. "Something has happened â
something I cant talk about over the
wires. It concerns you and your
mother and sister. You'll know all
about it as soon as I can flr.d Orntsby
and send him out to you."
.Penelope's "Oh!" was long drawn
and gasping.
"Is any one dead?" she faltered.
Kent went to the telephone and called
up the Brentwood apartments. U was
Penelope that answered.
"Well. I think you owe it." she be
gan as soon as he had given his name.
â¢â¢What did I do at 11153 Van Brocks
to make you cut me dead?" ._ -
"Why. nothing at all. I'm sure. Iâ I
war. leokinjr for Mr. ormsby, andâ
"Not when I saw you." she broKe
in flippantly. "You were handing
Miss Portia e.n ice. Are you still look
ing for Mr. Ormsby?"
"I am â just that. Is he with you â¢
"No; he left here about twenty
minutes ago. Is it anything serious?"
"Serious enough to make me want
to find him as <:uick a3 I can. Did
he say he was coming down to the
Wellington?"
"Of course he didn't." laughed Pen
elope. And then, "Whatever is the
matter with you this evening, Mr.
Kent?"

There are several stories In Oc
tober McClure's which will make a
distinct impression and merit
comment. In "A Good Samaritan,"
Mary R. Shipman Andrews, with a
realism that is the truest art, describes
the humorous experiences of a young
rector and an intoxicated friend whom
he feels In duty bound to escort home.
There is -a love story and real human
interest along with It. Lloyd Osborne
In "Glass-Eyed Bill" has done one of
his very, best, full of dry humor, and a
most Interesting situation. Eugene
Wood offers another of his bully bits
of comedy from real life in describing
the â¢ "Firemen's Tournament." It is
strong in the force of Its suggestion
and familiarity. As usual there is a
bright story of children, this time "A
Fruit of the Fair," by Marion Hill
with some Wonderful drawings by F. Y.
Cory- Lerby Scott tells a fascinating
story of mingled pathos, humor and
tragedy in "Tho Prison Days of Billy
MacCheek."
The number includes several bits of
excellent verse, "The Forerunners" by
Florence Wilkinson, "A Serenade in
Autumn" by Hermlnie Templeton,
"The Child in the Midst" by Margaret
E. Sangster, and "The World is Round"
by A. E. Housman. The number also
Includes the concluding chapters of

There is much food for thought for
wideawake girls and boys In George
Ethelbert Walsh's article in the Octo
ber St. Nicholas, entitled "What a
Lump of Coal Could Do." .He shows
that a small lump of coal, suddenly
converted Into steam, if Its energy
were utilized, would be sufficient to
run an electric motor car full of pas
sengers two and a half miles at tha
rate of twenty miles an hour, or would
carry a train of ordinary cars and a
heavy Pullman sleeper and dining-car
one-sixth of a mile at the rate of twen
ty-five miles an hour. The article will
prove an interesting exposition of thÂ«
transformation wrought In thÂ» labor
field by man's utilization of coal and
its latent powers.

of them, with their various sources,

Heroine helps hero to escape through

the writer, "Is, next to being a symbol
of the faith, more great as a monument

most important cathedrals besides out

With the seriousness characteristic
of the Englishman at his sports,
"Badsworth," high priest and chief
nagus of bridge whist, or bridge to
be more proper, now turns apologist
for the game he has sponspred these
ten years past and delivers himself of
a "Defense of Bridge" in pamphlet
form, which, for logic heaped up and
argument piled on argument, might
well cause the shades of Butler or
Jeremy Taylor to shiver and turn
back. From a reading of his impas
sioned apologia it appears that the
same Is delivered in reply to an at
tack by an ecclesiastical organ of
Englandâ an attack which brands
bridge as worse than poker and com
parable only to the "rouge et nolr"
of Monte Carlo in Its blighting effects
upon society. Stoutly does "Bads
worth" rally to the charge- and val
iantly does he expound the high quali
ties of the game from the viewpoint
of ethics and sociology,
"The ' large claim for bridge," he
concludes, "is that it can bring light
and pleasure into every home in the
land, from castle to cottage, and im
prove the memory, the reasoning pow
ers and the Judgment of every man
in the kingdom from Premier to
peasant."

edly Invaded a field already overwork
ed by books of the "Mrs. Wiggs" and
"Second Mrs. Jim" type, her Susan
Clegg sketches have a distinct tone of
originality and can have no imputation
of imitation attached to them.
In the first story, "The Marrying of
Susan Clegg." we have that lady of
strenuous convictions introduced to us
through her guileless confessions of
matrimonial aspirations that are
poured over the back fence Into the
willing ears of a doltish neighbor. Su
san, who has faithfully served a par
alytic father through all the days of
her maidenhood, now finds age creep
ing on with the father still as a heavy
asset and no mate to share the ques
tionable Joys of her companionship.
With delightful naivete she Invites one
of her elected suitors to come and give
his professional opinion as to the prob
able duration of Clegg senior as a fac
tor in marital consideration and she
cheers herself with the aphorism that
"a watched pot never boils." A de
lightful ingenuous creature this Su
san Clegg.
But it is In the second story, "Miss
Clegg's Adopted," that the writer's
humor bubbles over with riotous effer
vescence. With father dead and burled
Susan is torn between the duty of pro
viding him with a suitable tombstone
and the desire to take to her maidenly
bosom an orphan for loving upbring
ing. The stonecutter has an entranc
ing article of graveyard furniture In
the shape of a recumbent lion, which
is moved wi^h visible grief over the
demise of the individual whom he may
be selected to honor. Here is a trans
cript of . Susan's haggling over this
treasure, as faithfully reported to Mrs.
Lathrop:
"He's three hundred dollars, but the
man says that's because his tail's out
o 1 the same block. I asked him if he
couldn't take the tail off, but he said
fwould hurt his reputation. He
said 'f I'd go up the ladder to his sec
ond floor 'n' look down on the lion I'd
never talk about sawin* off his tail,
'n' he sald't anyhow cuttin' It off would
only make it cost more because it was
cut on In the first place. I saw the
sense o* that 'n* I remembered too, *t
even 'f folks In the cemetery never can
see the tail, father '11 have to look at
it from higher up 'n the ladder In the
monument man's shed, 'n* I don't want
him to think 't I economized on the
tail of his tombstone." -
Through the experience of "Jathrop
Lathrop's Cow," the awful catastrophe
attending the discovery of Cousin Mari
on and the diplomatio disposition of
the minister's children during that
worthy's vacation. Susan Clegg's con
tinuous monologue carries the reader.
Susan Is not the philosopher of Mrs.
Rice's conception, nor the . philanthro
pist of the Mrs. Jim stripe. She Is
wholly self-centered, wholly selfish.
The charm in her lies entirely in. her
picturesque diction and the breezlhess
of her thoughts concerning the Import
of the several village happenings In
which she is either an active' partici
pant or of which she is an' Interested
spectator. Anne Warner has made her

past. He styles the whole "Recreations
of an Anthologist." The great number
of readers who hold Mr. Matthews in
familiar address through the varied
and manifold character of his writings
will find this little collection of
sketches fully satisfying, and a return
to them for those that % .have already
read them in . magazine form will not
be without profit.
In a prefatory essay of quaint
humor Mr. Matthews defines the joys
of the anthologist and the characteris
tics that he holds in common with the
collector of tea cuds or the hoarder ot
boot heels from off the shoe of fame.
Through' all of man's mania for col
lecting, be it counterfeit coins, can
celed stamps or shoe buttons, the
essayist sees clearly the primitive In
stinct of our fathers of arboreal dwell
ings, of the man in the Nth degree,
"who hung suspended by his prehen
sile tail from the boughs of the forest
primeval." So without apology -or
reservation he admits a partiality for
the Joys of the anthologist â the col
lector and compiler of literary shoe
buttons, if vou will â and he submits
this brace of essays as a sort of by
product of his larger labors.^
As supplementary to an earlier
paper of his on "The Ethics of
Plagiarism" and illustrative of '.the
way in which that charge may be
falsely Imputed by a too willing critic,
Matthews traces In his first essay the
path of an odd literary conceit down
through the centuries. By taking
from the pen of Austin Dobson one
of his rondeaus of quaint conception
he shows its earlier prototype to- be
in â¢ the French of Volture, farther back
still in the same tongue, Desmarets,
and finally one of the strange flings
of wit of the old Spaniard, Lope de
Vega. A Journey, thus, into the lit
erary rag bag, so to speak, with an
eye to matching the colors for a crazy
quilt.
The essayist's two themes on "Un
written Books"* and "Seed Corn for
Stories" carry more Interest than any
thing else in the volume. In tha first
of these he cites the noted cases of
the Intervention of death between the
inception and the accomplishment of
a writer's task and gives us other less
known Instances of authors' promises
that have never been fulfilled. Vague
castles in the air were thoae of Rich
ard Brinsley Sheridan, who promised
to write his comedy par excellence,
"Affectation," and did not; of Mollere,
who was ever talking of a forthcoming
"L'Homme de Cour"; of Victor Hugo,
whose publishers advertised for years
a book which never wrote itself. More
fascinating still is Matthews' review
of the plots for, stories yet unwritten,
which writers have left to the world In
their crammed notebooks. "A person
to catch fire-flies and try to kindle his
household fire with them" scribbled
Hawthorne in his notebook. A man
is born into the world endowed with
an intellect far superior to those of
his fellows, according to Poe's "Mar
ginalia"; suppose he was confined as
an Insane person, what would his feel
ings be?
Though he is in no particularly ar
gumentative mood, the writer does not
make out a very good case for Ameri
can satire. Noting the fact that two
British compilers of English satire did
not see x fit to incorporate in their
works any samples of the American
product, Mr. Matthews , goes on to
trace the growth of that form of verse
in this country with illustrative pas
sages. Lowell with his "Bigelow
Papers" would appear, to be the only
writer this side of the water, meriting
the name . of . a satirist. Nor in the
domain of 7 poetic epigram can the
writer find mucti of home product that

The caller made answer quite merrily: "Well, Martin, it was a long
shot to try on anybody, but I'd heard that Mr. Larkmead was an easy
mark, so I didn't waste any new tricks on him at the start. Of course, if
I'd known you were here I'd tried the best trick in my bunch, for there's
little in the way of my graft that you didn't learn to block when" you
were with Mr. Lacquerre."
"Well," rejoined Martin, in a tone he might have used in discussing
pictures, potatoes or parties, "Mr. Larkmead has it in him to be a sharp
one, but while he's learning his way around you and your crew of bunko
men will save a lot of postage in cutting him off your list, for I'm on
guard here. Now you may get ouf, for I'm expecting Mr. Larkmead home
presently."
'â¢So long, Martin," replied the other, seemingly undistressed by Mar
tin's plain language. "I'm glad to see you in such a good place. If I
think of a new kind of begging letter dodge I'll try it on you, for if it
passes you it will be good for fair. So long, Martin,"
. I was dazed at the condition revealed by this fortunately overheard
conversation, and. expected a long explanation of the begging letter busi
ness when I asked Martin if any one had called that afternoon.
"Only Mr. Oscar Smith, sir," answered Martin.
"I told you to keep him if he should call."
"There was no use, sir.- I gave him what he needed."
"Mongr?" . : . ..Â¦ -Hy:
"No, sir; advice. I've known him a long timeâ not as Mr. Oscar

Martin said no more about turning the professional begging letter
writer away, and seems to include the whole strange matter in the way
of his regular duties.
at him -as if I had discovered a pond in which I could drop a pebble
without making circles..
Martin has, as a matter of routine/ assumed charge of more things
than I had supposed came within the province of a valet's duties, but this
assumption is without any degree of emphasis, not even of zeal; rather as
a matter of fact, which dissuades me from questioning the resulting
statiis. An accident showed me how varied are his activities. In the
mail he gave me this morning with the coffee he serves before mv bath
was a letter which interested me much. It was from a stranger who
pleasantly told me he had chanced to see a small man take up arms, so to
say, against a bully who was condemning my speech before the Reuben
Larkmead Club. It seems that the events of that evening are the subject
of lively controversy in the district, and my partisan, in the instance related
by my correspondent, retorted with his fist when my traducer grew vio
lent in denouncing me. My knightly friend was in a fair way to be rough
ly handled, but my correspondent saved the plucky little fellow from fur
ther punishment. "I learned that the little chap was out of work and had
been ill,!' wrote my correspondent, "so I took the liberty of rewarding
him for standing up for you asrainst such physical odds. He really is in
need of more help than I could afford to give him, but I told him that if
he would swallow his pride and let you help' him you would consider that
he had done you a further favor thereby. He was loath to apply to you
for aid, but may do so, as his necessities are great. By the way, his
name is Oscar Smith." , â¢
I could not but be greatly moved at reading this letter, for it is by
such evidence that I keep faith in my. heart that all New York is not a
Selfish seeking crew, eager to. impose on good nature and credulity.
iJere is a poor fellow in want and ill who, without hope of reward, takej
my part to the point of physical assertion. As chance has given me
knowledge of his loyal nature, I shall rejoice at the opportunity to make
proper acknowledgment. I shall tell Martin that if Mr. Oscar Smith calls
in my absence he is to be detained until my return.
Later when I returned to dress for dinner I "heard voices in the din
ing-room, which aroused suspicion that Martin was entertaining callers
there. I was about to make investigation when my progress was ar
rested by hearing my name used freely by Martin and another speaker.
Martin said in his usual placid tone, "No, Mr. Oscar Smith, you can't
pluck Mr. Larkmead while I'm with him. I guess if you knew that I
was here you wouldn't try that Â«old trick of pretending to be a poor sick
devil who had struck a bully in defense of Mr. Larkmead. That's an old
time begging letter writer's trick."
My valet's name is Martin. I know little else about him, not even
whether that is a Christian or surname,' and beyond the fact that he was
Mr. Lacquerre's valet I never expect to know more about Martin. He is
the most peculiar man I ever encountered, chiefly so because there is
nothing peculiar about him. He has absolutely no mental, temperamental,
physical or metaphysical characteristic. . He is neither tall nor short,
thick nor thin, grave nor gay, mild nor peppery, quick nor slow. He fas
cinates me, although for a time his colorlessness made me all but uncon
scious of his being.
Doubtless that which we ordinarily note in an individual to differentiate
him in some small oddity which fixes our attention to the exclusion of
the consideration that he is a human being. A- man â an unfeathered, bare
man â is an almost. exciting thing to contemplate. Martin is without that
oddity which fixes attention to the specimen rather than to genusâ is with
out, for example, any view of things with which I differ or which i do not
understand; is devoid of any eccentricity of accent or vocabulary or of
manner. He is revealed simply as a human being, and as merely such

he may have but one leg; believe in fortune tellers or even assert that the
I report these eccentric views of Mrs. Lacquerre's because they may
explain to you why my reception here has not been as general or as en
thusiastic as I had anticipated. Now I must take up in . chronological
order the events which altered my style of living and started me on the
way to make a "gang" of my own in the set to which Mrs. Lacquerre
and Aunt Sarah belong.
After my experience with that rascal valet, Bowker, the matter of en
gaging an apartment for me was undertaken by Mrs. Lacquerre, to my
great relief of mind. She also obtained a valet for me, but when I urged
her to order the furnishing of my apartment she declined.

any money for you, so let dear Sally shop for you. Sally's a fool .in
many things, and she's saying unlovely things about me because you don't
marry your cousin Josephine, but she has mighty good taste about house
furnishing, and will not spend so much money for you as I would. The
delirkfus delight of emptying another purse than my own would be too
much for me."
So Aunt Sarah furnished the apartment, and with perfect taste, no
doubt; but if she is an economical shopper I am fortunate to have escaped
the machinations of an expensive one.
DEAR UNCLE SILAS: The change in my estate has been so
notable since my letter of a few weeks ago that I have a sense
of being another person than the Reuben Larkmead who came
here to New York from Beetville to finish his education in the
School of Man. I have seen several finishes, as the saying is,
but my education still progresses. When I first came here it seemed to me
that for the possessor of wealth living in the modern hotels constituted the
acme of luxury. I supposed that to a man of my superior intelligence the
doors of New York's literary and artistic sets would fly open in welcome.
I was convinced that the advent of a scholar and a gentleman would be
heralded as an event of importance. I imagined that the income I enjoy
would have been sufficient of itself â if no other attribute did so â to attract
the attention of financiers. That to one so well equipped with profound
views on matters of national policies statesmen would extend the calm
hands of fellowship. Not so!
I find that I was wasting wealth at a hotel for a mere mask of lux
ury, a pretense of comfort: that New York's literary and artistic sets, if
such exist, are unmindful of my presence; that the advent of a scholar and
a gentleman is of less interest to New York than the arrival of a prize
winning bulldog; that the income I enjoy is relatively so unimportant that
it has as yet attracted the attention only of schemers; that as to my views
on national policies, so far from stirring statesmen to hospitality, I have
had to hire a hall and contend with a riot on the only occasion when I
have aired my political opinions in this benighted city.
As 1 am one quick to perceive conditions and sensitive to environment
I already conclude, after but a few months of neglect, that I must not wait
in modest retirement for a call to make my merits known, but, as a quaint
saying In vogue here expresses it, "butt in" wherever I wish to enter. I
find it repellant to my sense of a man's duty to man to adopt Mrs. Lac
querre's advice to let the world wag as it \villj undeflected by effort of mine
to wag it as I will. She counsels me that men of wealth and social posi
tion have found it futile to attempt to take the conduct of public affair!
out of the hands of men of no wealth and no social position who now
control. She expresses herself on the subject in "those vague generalities
common to her sex, as when she says, "The people have determined that,
before a man shall be trusted with the direction of public affairs he shall
have proved himself incapable of conducting any other affairs success
fully; shall not have obtained a competence nor social distinction, such
attainments being evidence of unfitness to guide the affairs of those who
have failed. Dear old Jack," the lady continued, speaking of the late Mr.
Lacquerre, "while he was well housobrokc, and did not interfere with mj
way of running our domestic affairs, had a fussy notion that a man oÂ»
leisure and education should devote some of his means and brains to the
conduct of public affairs. What did he* get out of it? A diamond-studded
match box, for which he had to pay in the end. as well as the hill for the
dinner at which it was presented by his adoring district club â which de
nied him a nomination to Congress on the ground that his income and so
cial popularity made him obnoxious to the voters.
"It served the dear old chap right for mixing up outside of his class.
Bah! Take a worldly woman's advice, Reuben, and believe that no man
or woman was ever rcalij r comfortable in a position won by butting in.
Not that you can't get anything you pine for, from the Presidency to an in
vitation to occupy an opera box â on a repeat night â by hard, consistent
butting. But when you've got it, and know that you got it by- butting,
that knowledge must destroy any feeling of triumph. When one knows
that he is de trop and yet can enjoy the situation, one is a pig. Keep to
your own class, to your own set in your own class, and. as much as possi
ble, to your own gang in your own set. Then there will be no more ham
mers out for you than are needed for your own proper guidance. You
are started right at last, in your own apartment, with your own servants;
and the thing for you to do is to pace along soberly until, you have snug
gled into a set. Then make your owji gang, and at last you will begin to
have interests in common with others; common duties, recreations, fol
lies and virtues with a few men and women. That, my boy, is what con
stitutes society as society is spoken of among us. A woman, let us say,
comes to New York and is introduced in the Brown-Smith-Jones set, and
straightway thinks she is in the Brown-Smith-Jones society. She proba
bly met them, as a matter of fact, because Brown or Smith or Jones want
ed to pull her husband's leg. When the leg is pulled â nothing more doing,
Reuben! The Brown-Smith-Joncses have common interests grown up out
of a lifetime of intimate association. What the deuce do they want with
Mrs. Lady-whosc-husband's-leg-has-been-pullcd? Nevertheless, the lady's
local home paper prints with pride that she is in the Brown-Smith-Jones
set in New York. But she knows "she isn't. My, my, honey, how hard
she knows she isn't!"

ADVENTURES OF REUBENCÂ«5jyrtj3n. 380*. fcy Central Xeirs and PreÂ«a Exchanxa.
Another entertainer told me the following story, although' If
was a joke against himself. He and Corney Grain were sharing one
summer a cottage on the river. A man called early one day to
discuss affairs, and was talking to Corney in the parlor, which
was on the ground floor. The window was open. The other en
tertainerâthe man who told me the story â was dressing in the
room above. Thinking he recognized the voice of the visitor be
low, he leaned out of his bedroom window to try to hear better.
He leaned out too far and dived headforemost into a bed of flowers,
his bare legsâ and only his bare legsâ showing through the open
windo.w of the parlor. "Good gracious," exclaimed the visitor;
turning at the moment and seeing a pair of wriggling legs above
the window sill: "Who's that?" Corney fixed his eye-glass and
strolled. to the window. "Oh, it's only Whatshisname," he ' ex
plained. "Wonderful spirits. Can be funny in the morning.*
In real life I never knew but one case where a man suffered,
in silence â unpleasantness he could have ended with a word â and'
that was the case of the late Corney Grain. He had been engaged
to give his entertainment at a country house. The lady was a
nouvelle riche of snobbish instincts. She left instructions that
Corney Grain when- he arrived was to dine with the servants. The
butler, who knew better, apologized, but Corney was a man not
easily disconcerted. He dined well, and after dinner, rose and ad
dressed the assembled company: "Well, now, my good friends,"
said Corney, "if we have all finished, and if you are all agreeable,
I shall be pleased to present to you my little show." The servants
cheered. The piano was dispensed with. Corney contrived to
amuse his audience very well for half an hour without it. At ten
o'clock came down a message: Would Mr. Corney Grain kindly
come up into the drawing room. Corney went. The company in
the drawing room were waiting seated. "We are quite ready, Mr.
Grain," remarked the hostess. "Ready for what?" demanded Cor
ney. "Four your entertainment," answered the hostess. "But IVe
giver/it already," explained Corney; "and my engagement was for
one performance only." "Given it. Where? When?" "An hour
ago, downstairs." "But this is nonsense," exclaimed the hostess.
"It seemed to me somewhat extraordinary," Corney replied, "but
it has always been my privilege' to dine with the company I am
asked to entertain. I took it you had arranged a little treat for the
servants." And Corney left to catch his train.
A troubled evening I had years ago was when I accompanied a
young widow to a . musical "at home" given by a lady who
had more acquaintances than she kneiv. My friend spoke first.
"Say, Mrs. Dash?" The butler did not wait for more, but shouted
out: "Mr. and Mrs. Dash?" "My dear, how very quiet you have
kept it," cried our hostess delighted. "Do let me congratulate you?'
The crush was toq great and our hostess too distracted at the mo
ment for any explanations. We were swept away; and both of us
spent the remainder of the evening feebly, protesting our single
ness. If it had happened on the stage it would have taken us the
whole play to get out of it. Stage people are not allowed to put
things. right when mistakes are made with their identity. If the
light comedian is expecting a plumber, the first man that comes
into the drawing room has got to be a plumber. He is not allowed
to point out that he never was a plumber; that he doesn*t look
like a plumber ; that no one but a blithering idiot would mistake
him for a plumber. He has got to be shut up in the bathroom and
have water poured over. him just as if he were a plumber â a stage
plumber, that is. Not till right at the end of the last act is he per
mitted to remark that he happens to be the new curate. I sat out
a play, once at which most people laughed. It made me sad. A
dear old lady entered toward the end of the first act. We knew
she was somebody's aunt. Nobody can possibly mistake the stage
aunt â except the people on the stage. They, of course, mistook
herÂ«for a circus rider and shut her up in a cupboard. It is what
cupboards seem to be reserved for on the stage. Nothing is ever
put in them except the hero's relations. When she wasn't in a
cupboard she was in a clothes basket or tied up in a curtain. All
she need have done was to hold on to something while she said to
the hero: "If you'll stop shouting and jtfmping about for just ten
seconds and give me a chance to observe that I am your maiden
aunt from Devonshire, all this tomfoolery can be avoided." That
would have ended it. As a matter of fact that is what did end it,
at five minutes past eleven. It never occurred to her to say it be
fore. /
* * *
For folks closely related to lions, introductions must be try-
Ing ordeals. You tell them that for years you have been yearning
to meet them â that this is indeed a privilege. They, then, at this
point, have to explain to you that they are not the Mr. So-and-So,
but only his brother or his father ; and all you can think of to say
is, "Oh, I'm so sorry." I had a nephew who was a famous ama
teur bicycle champion â I have him still, but he has come down to
a motor car. In sporting circles I was always introduced as "Shor
land's uncle." But my case was not so bad as that of a friend of
mine, a doctor. He married a leading actress and was known ever
afterward as "Miss Blank's husband." ~'At public dinners, where
you take your seat for the evening next to some one you have pos
sibly never met before and are never likely to meet again, finding
conversation is difficult and dangerous. I remember talking to a
lady at a Vagabond Club dinner. She asked me during the course
of the evening â with a light laugh, as I afterward recollected â
what I thought candidly of the last book of a certain celebrated
authoress. I told her and a coldness sprang up between us. She
was the celebrated authoress. She had changed her place so as to
avoid sitting" next to another lady novelist. One has to change
one's place sometimes on these occasions. A newspaper man
came up to me once at the Mansion House. "Would you mind
changing places with me," he asked. "It's so awkward. They've
put me next to my first wife."

sirous of agreeable partners â "an agreeable person," according to
the late Lord Beaconsfield's definition, being "a person who agrees
with you"â <o\ild make their own selection. "Excuse me. Would
you mind turning round a mimite. Ah, r Wagnerian Crank.' I am
afraid we should not get on together. I. prefer the Italian school."
Or, "How delightful. 1 see you don't believe in vaccination. May
I take you in to supper r" Those, on the- other hand, fond of
argument would choose a suitable opponent. A master of cere
monies might be provided who would stand in the -center of the
room and call for partners: "Lady with strong views on subject
of female franchise wishes to meet with gentleman of sound con
servative principles." "Brewer of comfortable means desires intro
duction to lady abolitionist."
ON BEING INTRODUCED
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
I have sometimes thought it. would be a serviceable device if
in society we all of us wore a neat cardâ pinned, : say, upon our
backs â setting forth such information as is necessary; one's name
legibly written and how to be pronounced ; our age (not necessarily
in good faith, but for the purposes of conversation. I seriously
hurt a German lady once by demanding of her information about
the war of eighteen 1 seventy. She looked to me forty. It turned
out she was only twenty-seven. Had I not been an Englishman 1 1
might have had to fight a duel) ; our religious and political beliefs,
together with a list of the subjects we were most at home upon,
and a few facts concerning our careerâ sufficient to save : . the
stranger from what is vulgarly termed "putting his foot in it."
Before making jokes about Chamberlain; or discussing' the South
African war, one would" glance behind him arid note whether one's
companion was ticketed "Imperialist" or "Pro-Boer." Guests de-
friendship. Don't seem to be looking too closely at her â got a
slight squint she doesn't like noticed." By this time we have
reached the lady, and he introduces one as a friend of his simply
dying to know her. "Wants to talk to you about your book," he
explains; "disagrees with you entirely on the subject of platonic
friendship. Sure you'll be able to convince him." It saves us
# both a deal of trouble. I start at once on platonic friendship and
ask her questions about twins ; avoiding sausages and coke. She
thinks me a most interesting man; and I am less bored than other
wise T might be. ' Â¦'Â¦Â¦â¢'*
CHARMED. Very hot weather we've been having lately â
I mean cold. Let me see. I did not quite catch your
name just now. Thank you so much. Yes, very nice
man indeed. No, I'm only passing through. And a si
lence falls, neither of us being able to think what to say next.
What has happened is this: The editor of the has
met me in the doorway and shaken me heartily by the hand. "So
glad you were able to come," he has said ; "some friends of mine
here, very anxious to meet you." He has bustled me across the
room. "Delightful people. You'll like themâ have read all your
books." He has brought me up to you and presented me. We have
exchanged the customary commonplaces; and you are waiting for
me to say something clever, original and tactful ! And I don't
know whether you are Presbyterians or Mormons, protectionists
or free traders; whether you are engaged to be married or have
lately been divorced.
A friend of mine adopts the sensible plan of always providing
you with a short history of the person to whom he is about to lead
you. "I want to introduce you to a Mrs. Jones," he whispers;
"clever woman. Wrote a J)ook two years ago. Forgot the name
of it â something about twins. Keep away from sausagesâ father
ran a pork shop in the Borough. Husband on the Stock Ex
change. Keep off coke â unpleasantness about a company. You'll
get on best by sticking to the book. Lot in it about platonic: .','Is she pretty? Is she .fascinating?
Do men like. her?" were the questions
that were , running , through "her ; mind.
Of course, as his mother's guest. Jack
would have to pay her a good . deal of
attention. - â¢ â¢ ... â¢-.-....
"Hurry up!" she ordered suddenly,
feeling a quick, breathless need to find
out herself just how . seductive
Miss- Dariby'was,' and five .minutes
later,; she â¢ was : greeting ." a : tall," dark
girl, whose -eyes 'and smile nullified
all attempts at criticism. :
Jack, too, seemed impressed â¢ by the
unusual character of the : newcomer's
charm. In repose, her face was almost
ugly. Then she would turn-those won-
derful, coercing eyes upon you and
smile, and forever after you watched
and waited. .
Even In the first hour Felicia trem
bled for her supremacy. Covertly she
noticed that Jack was . as irresistibly
attracted as she herself was. For ten
whole minutes he had not once looked
in her direction. , â¢
"She has a lovely smile," the latter
observed 1 craftily as her lover walked
home with her. â¢
"Heavenly!" was his unsuspecting
answer. "And her eyes! By Jove, I
never saw such eyes! , It isn't that
they're so beautiful, but it's what they
say. .When she looks at you you feel
as if you're It!" r
Felicia, walking behind him In the
narrow path, felt suddenly She
didn't have eyes that , made - you feel
that, you were It. She. didn't have a
smile that even Jack grew, enthusi
astic over. 'She was. just pretty.
"So unusual! She draws you in^pite
of yourself. I simply can't' keep my
eyes off from her. - She's fascinating."
; On heXwent'in the same strain, too
absorbed expressing his interest and
admiration to his other self to notice
the forlorn brevity of her replies." *
- "Not -to come over this evening?"
he repeated in, surprise, when, at the
door; she , told Â» him her. wishes. "You
must be. crazy. J Of course I'm' coming."
. But j in ; spite of , his protests she was
obdurate, and he .went away in a huff.
If Felicia were capricious during the
following week, Miss Danby was all
a man could wish. In her society
Jack's wounded pride was -soothed and
comforted. She 'made him forget his
worries and appear at his best.
Once, and once only, he . had a
heretical thought. He wished Felicia
were more like her. â¢ Then he winced
at his own disloyalty. Dear, blue-eyed,
sunny Felicia! . A wave of tenderness
swept over him and he determined
to find out without further delay what
was the Impalpable shadow that lay
between them ever since the Danbys
came.
"Well, by. Jove!" he exclaimed
aloud, a light dawning upon him.
Then, as if there were really no use
of trying adequately to ' express the
wonder that the suspicion caused
him,, he. exclaimed again helplessly,
"By Jove!""-- v .%.
"And she is the lady who believes
that an engagement should be the
lightest of ties; -that engaged people
should see as, much as possible of un
engaged ones. Oh. my eye! ".and he
threw back his head and roared with
delight. v : t-i !
That afternoon - they had It out.
Felicia, with burning cheeks and flash
ing eyes, accused him hotly. â¢
"You've been perfectly daft over
her from the - first Â¦ moment. . . There's
no use of denying it. You know you
have, and our engagementâ "
She choked," and Jack, who stood
looking down at her,- his hands thrust
in the pockets of -his short coat, fin
ished the sentence.
"Has stood the test of the Third
Person," he said In a teasing voice.
Then he held out: his arms, and after
one . startled, questioning glance, she
went "to him. . Â¦

THEY had been engaged for a
week. Felicia's heart was full of
the sweet wonder of It, yet her
mind clung tenaciously to a the
ory imbibed In the unrecorded days
that went before. It seemed a terrible
theory now, but, bewildered though
she was, she acknowledged its claim.
"Jack," she said solemnly,'"ah?^en
gagement snould be trie lightest,- roost
easily broken thing in . the world. '.' r ....
"Eh â what?" exclaimed her-compan
ion in amazement, bringing his truant
gaze back from, the stretch of moon
lit country whose : poetry seemed a
symbol of his own .happiness. "What's
that you're saying?" - â¢ .';'Â¦
"An. engagement," 'she- repeated
gravely, "should be taken as an exper
iment, a trial. At* the first suspicion
on the part of either person that he
or she has made a mistake, It should
be broken." ~,~ ' V : .-.'Â¦" : 'i--
An unconscious sigh, expressed the
relief she felt at getting: this senti
ment off her mind. -Another moment
and he was leaning 'toward her, with
her hands clasped - firmly, almost
roughly, in his, his voice sterner than
she had ever heard -if- - p -
"See here, little girl" â -
At something that he saw in her face
he stopped and his glance softened.
"I see," he said at last, with, boyish
relief. "It's only a theory. But -you
gave me a, shock that made my heart
Btai0 still. I was just thinking how
sweet and beautiful* life would be â you
and I togetherâ always. I felt as if
'Forever' had already begun, and right
in the midst of It you -plump 1 down a
remark like that, as if our. engagement
were . an . episode, . a , pastime. You
didn't mean it, darling. You"
Just here further words became un
necessary, but later on Felicia returned
to the subject. . . ..
"Still, Jack," ehe spoke' in the
thoughtful voice". of a person, who has
been mentally, occupied, with her sub
ject, Vtheoretically.-it does seem right.
Engagements are made to be broken,
if .they will break. More than that, I
believe, that when people "are .engaged
they ought : to see as much as possi
bleâ" :
Â¦ "Of .. each' other," he Interpolated ap
provingly. ' .
Â¦ -"Of other, eligible men and women,"
she cohtiued- calmlyi "Just-, to prove

* Jack frowned. It seemed ' to : him
that" the dearest" girl - in the world was
talking nonsenseâ chilling, analytical,
disquieting nonsense.
: "I : believe in' letting * well enough
alone,"' was his"polnted' comment, but

the moonbeams that night and fallen
into a deep and healthy slumber, Fe

chin pillowed on her hands, ' possessed
THE THIRD PERSON
that I did so, for presently there was
what sailors call a regular "plugmush,"
a free fight wherein the guiding princi
ple is"wherever you see a head hit it."
The battle was brief, if fierce, and its
results were so far good that uproar
ious laughter socn took the place of the
pandemonium that had so recently
reigned. Happily I had not brought
the dinner, in when the riot began, so
that still there was' some comfort, left.
Making haste I supplied the food, and
soon they. were all busy with'; it, their
dinner hour being -nearly gone.â â¢The
punishment of .the miscreant was un
avoidably deferred for want of time to
look for him, for he had vanished like
a dream. , Â¦ '.. ; â¢
But while v/e ate a sudden storm of
bad language rose on deck. Hurrying
out to see what fresh calamity had be
fallen, we found the nigger cook fling
ing himself about in a frenzy -of rage,
while* halfway up -the mainstay, well
out of everybody's reach, sat Jocko
with a fowl that he had snatched out
of the galley while the cook's back was
turned and was now carefully ; tearing
into fragments. Rushing to the stay,
the men shook it till the whole main-
mast vibrated, but the motion didn't
appear to trouble the monkey. Holding
the fowl tightly in one hand, he bound
ed up* into the maintop and thence to
the. mizzen topmast stay, where for the
time he had to be left in peace.
As; soon as "knock-off time came a
hunt was organized. It was a very ex
citing affair while it lasted, but not
only, were , the ' men tired, but that
- 1
garded as a-. changed, animal who fcxd
repented and forsaken his evil wayÂ»
for life. But my opinion of him never
changed. It was never asked, and I
knew better than to offer it, but there
was a lurking devil in his sleepy eyes
that assured me if ever he got loose
again his previous achievements would
pale Into insignificance before the feats
of diabolical ingenuity he would then
perform. Still the days and weeks
rolled by uneventfully until we were
well into, the fine weather to the
north'ard of the line in the Atlantic
We had been exceptionally favored
by the absence of rain, and owing to
the exertions of the second mate, who
was an enthusiast over his paint work,
her bulwarks within and her houses
were a perfectly dazzling white, with
a satiny sheen like enamel. In fact. I
heard him remark* with pardonable
pride that he'd never seen the paint
look so well in all his seven voyages
as the second of the Belle. Tenderly,
2.3 If it were his wife's face, he would
go over that paintwork even in his
watch below, with bits of soft rag
and some clean water, wiping off every
spot of defilement as soon as it ap
peared. Tarring down was accom
plished without a spot or smear upon
the paint, and the decks having been
holystoned and varnished, the second
mate now began to breathe freely. No
more dirty work remained to be done
and he would have a lot more time
to devote to his beloved white paint.
We had been slipping along pretty
fast to the north'ard and one afternoon
the old man had all hands up to bend
our winter suit of sails. Every moth
er's son of them were aloft except me,
and I was busy about the mainmast,
standing by to attend to the running
gear, as I was ordered from above. A3
they had hoiited all the sails up before
they had started aloft, they were there
a long time, as busy as bees, trying to
get the Job finished. At last all was
ready and down they came. One of
them went for'ard for something and
immediately raised an outcry that
brought all hands rushing to the spot,
thinking that the ship was on fire or
something. The sight tney saw was a
paralyzing one to a sailor. On both
sides of the bulwarks and the lower
panels of the house were great smears
and splashes of Stockholm tar. while
all along the nice blue covering board
the mess was Indescribable. With, one
accord everybody shouted:
"That monkey!"
Yes. as they spoke there was a dull
thud, and down from aloft fell a huge
oakum wad saturated with tar. They
looked up and there sat an Infernal
object, hardly distinguishable for a
monkey, being smothered from head
to tail end with the tnlck glutinous
stuff. But his white teeth gleamed and
his wicked eye twinkled merrily, as he
thought of the heavenly time he'd been
having, a recompense for what must
have seemed years of waiting. Too late
the men now remembered that thÂ© tar
barrel, its head completely out. had
been left upended by the windlass,
where it had been placed for conveni
ence during tarring down. It was there
still, but leading from tt In all direc
tions were streams of tar where Jocko
had dragged away the dripping wads
he had fished out of its black depths.
I was never revengeful, but If I had
been I should have felt sorry for the
second mate, my old tyrant, now. He
drooped . and withered like a scarlet
runner under the first sharp frost. Not
a word did he say, but he looked as ir
all the curses in every tongue that
ever were spoken were pouring over
his brain in a flood. Pursuit or the
monkey was out of the question.
Clambering over the newly tarred rig
ging was bad enough when done with
all care, but in a chase, especially
over places where it had been freshly
anointed by the fugitive, we should
have had all hands captured like flies
on a gummed string. : Â»Â» ?
They all stood and glared at the
mess like men not knowing how to
adjust their minds to this new condi
tion of things, nor, when the skipper
and mate came forward to see what
was the matter, did they contribute
any words good, bad or indifferent.
Apparently they would have remained
there till they dropped, fascinated by
the horrible sight, but suddenly pierc
ing screams aft startled -everybody.
Jocko had crept down the mlzzen
rigging and pounced upon poor little
Tip, who was delicately combing- him
self (he was as daintily clean as a
cat) on the after hatch. And now
Jocko was perched on the cro'jaek
yard vigorously wiping his tar
drenched fur with Tip as if he had
been a dry wad.
The second mate started from his
lethargy and sprang aloft to the rescue
of his screaming pet -with an agility
scarcely inferior to that of Jocko. Race
seemed to give him energy, for pres
ently he pressed Jocko so hard (he let
poor little Tip go as soon as he saw his
pursuer) that he ran out along the
mizzen topsail brace and. balancing
himself for a moment, covered his
eyes with hl3 hands and sprang Into
the sea. Bobbing up like a cork, he
struck out away from the ship which
was only Just moving, but in less than
five minutes he repented his rashness
and swam back. A line was flung to
him, he promptly seized it and was -at
once a captive again. The men were

in the folds of the main-topmast stay
sail that was lying .there loosely hud
dled together. Leaping upon the heap
of canvas, I screamed for help, bring
ing half a dozen men to the spot in a
twinkling.
Not without some severe bites was
the rascal secured, and by means of a
stout belt round his waist, effectually
prevented from getting adrift again. I
looked to see him summarily put to
death, but no one seemed to think his
atrocious V behavior merited any worse
punishment than a sound, thrashing
except the cook and steward;..and they,
feeing- oiir. natural enemies, . were, of
cours*/.unheedÂ«d."'4The fact is Jocko
had, after his first performance, con
fined his attentions to the cabin and
galley, where he had done desperate
damage and made the two darkies lead
a most miserable life. This conduct cf
â¢Â¦Mk^r. 1 believe, .saved ..his life, as those
.two functionaries were cordially de
tested Â¦; by â¢: the, men for many reasons.
At: any/- rate he was spared, and for
some time led a melancholy life chained
up ori>,the forecastle 'head during the
day and underneath It at night.
Meantime we" had sailed from Bom
bay and arrived at Conconada, where
the second mate bought a monkey, a
pretty tame little fellow that hadn't a
bit of vice in him. He was so docile
that when we got to sea again he was
allowed to. have, the run of the ship.
Petted by everybody, he never got into
any mischief, but often used to come
f orward and sit at a safe distance from
Jocko, making queer grimaces and
chatterlnga at him, but always mighty
careful not to get too near. Jocko
never responded, but sat stolidly like a
monkey of wood until the little fellow
strolled away, when .he would spring
up and. tear -at his chain, making a
guttural' noise that sounded as, much
like an Arab cursing as anything ever
I heard. -
So little Tip went on his pleasant
way, only meeting with one small mis
hap for a long time. He was sitting on
deck one sunny afternoon with his back
against the coamings of the . after
hatch, his little round head Just visible
above its edge. One of the long-legged,
raw-boned roosters we had got in Con
conada was â¢ prowling near on the
never-ending quest for grub. Stalking
over the hatch he suddenly caught
Bight of this queer little gray knob
sticking up. , He stiffened himself,
craned his neck forward, and then
drawing well back dealt it a peck like
a miniature pickax falling. Well, that
little monkey was more astonished
than ever I saw an animal in my life.
He fairly screamed with rage, while
the rooster stood as If petrified with
astonishment at the strange result of
his investigations.
Owing to the close, watch. kept upon
Jocko he led a blameless life for
months. Apparently reconciled to his
captivity he gradually came to be re-
<CopJ>.-irht by McClure. Phillips & Cb.)
WHEN Nathaniel D. Troop of
Jersey City. U. S.' A.," pres
ently A. B. on board the
British Iship -Belle, solemnly
; announced his intention of
investing in a monkey the next. time
old Daddy, the bumboatman, came
alongside, tlicre was a breathless hush,
something like consternation, among
his shipmates. It was in Bombay, and
eventide,'' and all we of the foremast
hands were quietly engaged upon our
supper {tea is the names for the cor
responding: ireal ashore)* with great
content resting upon ue, for bananas,
rooties, duck eggs and similar bum
boat-boush l 'luxuries abounded among
us. So that the chunk of indurated
buffalo that had resisted all assault3
upon it dt dinner time lay unmolested
at the bottcm of the beef-kid, no one
feeling sufficiently interested to bestow
a swear on it.
For some time after Nat's pronounce
ment nobody spoke. The cool breeze
v.hispered under the fo'c's'le awning,
the Bramley kites wheeled around
v.liistlins hungrily and casting their
envious watchful eyes upon our plates,
and somewhere in the distance a
dinghy-wallah intoned an interminable
legend to his fellow sufferers that
sounded like the high-pitched drone of
bees on a sultry afternoon among the
flowers. Then up and spake John de
Ba-ptiss :
"Waffor, Nat? Wan we ben dween
t'yo? Foh de Lawd sakes, sah, cf yew
swain bring Macaque 'bord dis sheep
you'se stockin' trubble 'nough ter fill
er mighty long hole."
" 'Sides," argued Cockney Jem,
" 'tain't 'is if we ain't got a monkey.
'Few wornt any monkey tricks played
on us wot price th' kid "ere," and he
pointed to me.
"Naow jess yew hole on half a min
nit," drawled Nat, "'relse yew'll lose
your place. Djer ever know me ter
make trubble sense I ben abord
thlshyer litnejuice dcrg'-basket? Xaw;
I've a learnt manners, I hev, 'n don't
never go stickin* my gibbie in another
man's hash, I don't. But in kase this
kermunity sh'd feel anyways hurt at
my perposai, lemme 'splain. I s'pose
1 ain't singler in bein' ruther tired er
these blame hogs forrad here. Hogs is
all right, ez hogs, but they don't make
parler pets wuth a cent. N'wen I finds
one blggern a porpuss a wallerin' round
in my bunk *n rootin' 'mong the clean
straw my bed's stuffed with, its keind
er bore in erpon me that fresh pork
fer dinner's wut I ben pinin' fer a long
lime. Naow, I know thet I kin teach
a monkey in about tew days 'nough ter
make him scare the very chidlins er
them hogs inter sossidge meat if they
kum investigatin* where he's on dooty.
'N so I calkerlate to be a sort*- benny
factor 'slf yew ain't overnabove grate
ful."
By this time the laces of Nat's au
dience had lost the look of apprehen
sion they had worn at first. Everybody
had an account to settle with those
pigs, which swarmed homelessly about
the fore part of the deck and never
missed an opportunity of entering our
domicile during our absence, doing such
acts and deeds there as pigs are wont
to perform. As they were a particular
hobV>- of the skipper's we were loath
to deal with them after their iniquities,
the more so as she was a particularly
comfortable ship. And if Nat's idea
should turn out to be a good one we
would all be gainers.
Consequently when Daddy appeared
in the morning Nat greeted him at
once with the question, "Yew got mon
key?" Promptly came the stereotyped
answer: "No, Sahib. Eberyting got.
Monkey no got. Melican war make
monkey bery dear."
However, as soon as Daddy was per
suaded that a monkey really was de-
Elred he undertook to supply one; and,
cure enough, next morning he brought
one with him, a sinister-looking beast,
about as large as a fox-terrier. He
was secured by a leathern collar and
a dog chain to the fife-rail of the fore
mast for the time, and one or two
of the men amused themselves by
teasing him until he was almost fran
tic Presently I came round where he
was lurking, forgetting for the time
ell about his presence. Seeing his op
portunity he sprang on to my shoulder
and bit me so severely that I carry his
marks now. Swarting with the pain.
I picked up a small piece of coal and
flung it at him with all the strength
I could muster. Unfortunately for me
I hit him on the head and made it
bleed, for which crime I got well rope's
ended by Nat. And besides that I
made an enemy of that monkey for the
rest of his time on boardâ many
monthsâ an enemy who never lost a
chance of doing me an ill turn.
He took to his master at once, and
was also on nodding terms with, o-ne
or two of the other men, but with the
majority he was at open war. Nat
kept him chained up near his bunk,
only taking him out for an airing at
Intervals, and at once commenced to
train him to go for the pigs. But one
day Nat laid in a stock of eggs and
fruit, stowing them as usual on the
Fhelf in his bunk. We were very busy
all the morning on deck, eo that I be
lieve hardly a chance was obtained by
any one of getting below for a smoke.
When dinner time came Nat went
straight to his bunk to greet his pet,
but he was nowhere to be seen. The
state of that bed, though, was some
thing to remember. Jocko had been
amusing himself by trying to make an
omelette, and the debris of two dozen
eggs was strewn and plastered over the
bunk, intermingled with crushed
bananas, torn up books, feathers out of
Nat's swell pillow, /and several other
things- While Nat was ransacking his
memory for some language appropriate
to the occasion a yell arose from the
other side of the forecastle where Daddy
Finn, a Liverpool Irishman of parts,
had Just discovered his week's whack
of sugar and the contents of a slush
pot pervading all the contents of his
chest. Other voices soon Joined in the
chorus as further atrocities *vere dis
covered, until the fo'c's'le was like bed

High above all the riot rose the wail

And it is astonishing what one can do
with taffeta. A- woman, seeing a bar
gain in cloud-colored taffeta of the

enough of it for a complete suit. It was

which, though lustrous, does not wrin

and smoothed out again without Injury.
It does not stiffen when wet, and it
wears, if not like Iron, certainly almost
as well as poplin, and* this is no exas
peration. Those who doubt can try a
good grade soft taffeta.
Well, this woman after she had pur
chased her soft cloud-colored taffeta
went to work upon It, cutting out the

let it Just swing clear from- the floor

Then she trimmed it with three knife
plaited ruffles set far apart and looking
as quaint as' you please. She fitted the
hips snugly and strapped the seams
with strappings of taffeta.
The waist, since the grown is for

a little like a Dlrectolre coat. There

Little boys'. Russian suits, with full

shops. The serge is almost smooth upon
the surface, is of fall weight and Is
made very natty by the enamel buttons

In the granite colors there are some
very nice things for i boys of older
growth. There is -a Scottish granite
Butting which looks like a coarse weave

the surface, but has wearing qualities
that cannot be duplicated anywhere.
It comes in .nub effect with flecks of
brown and red upon the surface, and it

colored ties.
They are trying to Introduce the

But, if any. woman | desires to fit her

white .linen collar, wide and well fit

of , it, 6he can- then cut a pattern from
it.- And;, in this manner she can obtain
the pattern for a collar to be made out
of light blue linen, of linen of a golden

Suits for Boys and Girls.
Those who contend that children
have some 'right in the matter of cloth
ing will surely be delighted at the ar
ray of children's apparel spread out be
fore them this season. Perhaps the
greatest innovation Is in the matter of
serge, that most useful material and
the least expensive considering its
wearing qualities.
' "I have noticed," concluded she, "that
all of your very best frocks are puffed
out at the shoulder, very much as they
were ten years ago. As for us, we have
made only three models on this style,
but they are being extensively copied
In Vienna, London and St. Petersburg,
the cities that, with Paris and New
York, lead the world in styles."
It la impossible to 'pass the seasons
by without noticing children's clothing
and the novelties in children's apparel.
One black broadcloth suit with coat
cut on the Tuxedo order and knickers.
Several nice white shirts should be a
part of this suit. And there should be
wide -white embroidered collars and a
dozen broad neckties in white and
black, navy blue and brown.
The boy should have a pepper and
salt suit with bloomers and blouse. And
with this he will wear a chemisette.
This style' of dress is worn for school
by large boys, who find . it com
fortable.
The boy will need two coarse suits
for every day wear and these should be
cut double breasted and buttoned with
bone buttons. A small brown suit with
vest, coat and knickerbockers will com
plete a very nice wardrobe.
The small boy's shoes are of much
importance. They come with exten
sion soles and wide toes. But these are
hardly polite shoes for the dining-room
and the small boy must put on slippers
â¢when he comes . in the house to his
meals. It is. therefore, a good thins
to provide him with a pair of tan shoes
of medium, weight for fall wear and a
pair of buttoned leather shoes and still
another pair of the glossy tip variety
tor wear afternoons. The boy himself
Handsome metal buttons are used
upon boys' coats as being more durable
than cloth buttons, and this is true
even in the case of the dressy black
suit and the very nice dark blue suit.
A certain tailor who makes clothing
for the little boys of the 400 designates
the following as a suitable wardrobe
for a small boy:
One navy blue serge sack suit with
two pairs of trousers, one. pair cut on
the bloomer order. bloused at the knee
and the other pair snug-fitting knicker
bockers. With this should go a serge
vest for wear on cooler days.
The berft overcoat for a small boy Is
the double-breasted variety, made out
of cloth of dull gray, or deep blue, or
steel color. It should be only medium
weight, for the small boy does not need
a very heavy overcoat. It should be
thick enough, but rather light and not
too long. There is a very handsome
English model, double-breasted and
coming just below the knees.
Prudent women are making the new
fall gowns. out of material with a yard
or two to spare. This yard or two is
laid away carefully, so as not to fade
the roods; and. In .time, it may come
in handy for new sleeves or for big
sleeve puffs put on at the shoulder.
The French puff shows the big full
Â«IeÂ«ve set into the armhole in big side
plaiting*. The sleeve is now pulled out
ONE of Mrs. Langtry's creditors
whispers that the Lily went
broke buying new gowns. "But
she'll pay for them to the last
dollar and buy more," says he.
It's a woman's tendency to pay for
things to the last dollar and buy more
which makes the dealers so ready to
cater to her and the manufacturers eo
ready to weave fine things for her. And
It Is to woman's appreciation of the
beautiful that the wonderful fabrics
of the season are due. It Is announced
that three of the Jersey Lily's new
gowns are quite distinctive. They have
the full high shoulder puff; they are
In the new shades of biscuit, dull red
and bunt corn color, and what Is quite
noticeable, all are made of Bilk. They
are of taffeta, moire and brocade. So
by 1 M * mark one can trace the coming
faifrimr. Look around and you will
see that the new gowns are made of
Bilk and that all have the high shoul
der puff.
Surely there Is no woman who has
forgotten this high shoulder which is
new yet old. It was the constant vogue
from. 1SS0 to 1900. For nearly ten years
It raged more or less and was at its
very height in '95. Surely no fashion
ever had so long a stay and no fashion
was ever one-half as popular.
All women, young and old, great and
â¢mall, wore the big shoulder and those
who walked in the front rank of fash-
Ion Â¦wore it emartly crinolined.
It was claimed for the big shoulder
puff that It made women very wide in
the shoulder, and that It made the
waist seem very small by comparison.
Anyway, It continued In vogue for ten
years and died hard.
Then It disappeared and the history
of the Baggy, baggy sleeve of the past
five years Is well known. And now,
lo and behold, the full puff shoulder
Is back and the new Paris models look
very much like those of ten years ago.
This sleeve, which is called a mutton
leg. because It looks so very much like
a leg of mutton, with the big part of
the leg at the shoulder, is worn with
cloth gowns and with silk dresses. It
Is beginning to come In with the new
reception gowns and one sees it creep-
Ing Into the coat sleeve*.
As yet one cannot afford to have all
one's fall gowns made in this way, for
fear it may not be permanent, but it
would be a very good thing to have one
or two fashioned with the high shoul
der, for It Is very likely that by spring
there will be no other sleeves seen or
Tips for Prudent Dressers.
BY AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
"It is the vogue of ruffles," said an
ultra-fashionable dressmaker the other
day, "and all the nice gowns are ruffled.
Some of them are trimmed with three
wide ruffles around the bottom, each
ruffle hemstitched. Others are trim
med with plain ruffles. It matters very
little whether the ruffle be lace trim
med, trimmed with Oriental stuff, scal
loped, or pinked or severely plain, so
long as It is a ruffle!"
And this same opinion was voiced
some time ago by the dressmakers'
convention in New York and echoed
by the dressmakers' representatives at
St. Louis. Ruffles will be the vogue,
and never. in all' the history of dress
were they as fashionable.
A Paris dressmaker who made the
trip across the sea to go to the exposi
tion said this to" a representative of this
newspaper the other day: "All Paris
gowns will -be itrljnmed with ruffles.
That gown there." pointing to a hand
some dress on exhibit,, "affords a fine
illustration . of ; the . ruffled ' mode.
"The skirt la trimmed with three
knife-plaited ruffles six inches apart.
The waist, .which is an Eton, Is ruffled
over the shoulders and down the front.
The sleeves are-' finished with ft wide
ruffle at the wrist, lined with white and
caught back uponvthe. arm;'; and there
U a neck, ruffle lined with white here

ing vogue for ruffles. ~ .
"From a close observation of the
gowns at St. Louis," said this author
ity, "I should say that your American
fashions :are;a little ahead of our,- Paris
styles. By that I mean that where we
are inclined to feel our way cautiously
you step; In '--boldly. '-"We are just com
ing'to a return of the shoulder puff,
while you are using It right along.
autumn and for the colder days late?"
on. \ . '
Even the foulards and the silks ot
China and India are not banished en
tirely, for they make* such line fabrics
for winter shirt waists. China silk in
all tints is made up with lace, with
fagottingr, with open hemstitching and
with lattice work. And' India silk ot
fine -texturr? is made the basis for
fiouncings of lace around the yoke, far
vests of lace and for some of the most
marvelous bodice trimmings that could
be pictured. ,
' To buy an India silk shirt waist no
longer means something simple and in
expensive. On the contrary, several of
these -waists retailed , a few days ago
in a New-York store for $75 each. And
an order was taken for one which was
to cost' $200. The owner is the wife of
a steel king and the waist, which is in
pale green India silk, is trimmed with
cushion lace, upon whose bobbins there
had been strung fish skin pearls, tiny
turquoise and mock gems.
All of the foulards are impressed into
winter, use and the light summer silks
of the shoos have been spirited away
by cunning modistes td reappear later
as fashionable shirt waists. From this
sign the home dressmaker might take a
hint and should she desire to cut up
an* old .summer silk into new winter
shirt waists she can do so with the full
approval of the best modistes In town.
A Season of Ruffles.)
Those who are always on the lookout
for new trimmings should learn to
make "cretes." To make a crete take
a frill of silk and scallop both edges.
Now shirr It a little way from the edge,
until the frill is moderately full and
set it upon the skirt.
This will make the edges stand out
like narrow ruffles each side of a
full ruff.
And there are different way* of mak
ing cretes. They take silk and cut It
In strips and double it. Both edges are
now pinked or frilled, frayed, or scal
loped. The frill Is now shirred over a
narrow cording and the cord Is pulled
until the frill Is Just full enough. It Is
sewed on the skirt, or the waist, upside
down, so that the edges will stand-out
In the smartest Imaginable fashion.
There are such varieties of small
trimmings this year. One 'who does
not follow the styles can have no Idea
of the number and the diversity of
tiny decorations that corne for sown
trimmings. One sees them upon ho
tel piazzas where the women sit and
work. And one sees them In the work
shops of the modistes, where the dain
tiest possible accessories of dress are
being made.
One very pretty style of trimming
calls for a button mold covered with
silk. A mold about the size of a sil
ver Quarter Is covered with gray taf
feta and over the top of It there arÂ«
drawn long threads, criss-crossing In
pretty style. This button mold Is now
set In the middle of a shirred rosette,
the edges of which are frilled out.
This makes a very pretty decoration
for the trimming of a gown.
They take button molds and cover
them with silvered gauze or with tiny
bits of cloth of silver. These make
beautiful trimmings for dinner
gowns. They can be worn also upon
the Dlrectolre coats. They are used
to give the double breasted effect and
two rows of buttons are also at the
back of the coat. The same Is done
with cold buttons and with buttons
that are covered with Jetted cloth.
Nor does ingenuity stop here.
One very enterprising dressmaker
Is taking round glass buttons and cov
ering them with cloth thickly studded
with tiny Jets. Thus she makes a ball
which looks precisely like a Jet ball.
And she takes the common flat pearl
buttons of large size, covers them
with silk and sews them on with blue
sewing silk, going up and down
through the button as though It had
not been covered with silk.
"I wish to Impress upon my pa
trons." said a Fifth avenue dressmak
er, "the value of the novelty laces.
A great deal can be done with a lace
that costs a comparatively small price.

did not dare speak. When he, found

spoke, not of himself, nor of their
predicament, and presently they were
chatting: as merrily as though there
had been none of the stormy scenes
of the afternoon.
They were still talking when of a
sudden they heard footsteps behind
them and they sprang to their feet.
Just behind; them was a tall, cleri
cal man in blue overalls and checked
calico Jumper.
"I hope I 'don't intrude," he said
quizzically.
"Are you Man Friday?" demanded
Nan. "You see we are Mr. and Mrs.

wreckedâ or at least I hope It is," she
amended viciously.
"I am sorry, Mrs. Crusoe," he said,

"What's the use of taking on so?"

"Do you suppose I thought then that

hinted darkly, "you would know that

rises as high."
He glanced ruefully at the canoe fast
disappearing on the tide, and scanned
the chore to see if it offered any hope.

Slowly and sadly the body of Ajax is

pont, the grave which was to be "ever
memorable among men," and his de
voted followers chant:
"Many things shall mortals learn by
seeing, . but, before he sees, no man
may read the future or his face." â¢
So endeth Ajax and all his woes, but
Harry Dewing, who portrays the
mighty warrior, Is about the busiest
and the most popular man In all Berke

of the month, and then, in all proba
bility, he will suddenly discover such
an avalanche of Latin, math and heav
en only knows what not, that he will
think the troubles of Ajax small in
comparison with his own. But then the
university does not produce Greek plays
every day. though it is turning over
a new leaf and premising to do better
in the future.
"Pictures'." exclaimed Miss Barrows,
as she looked at me and then at the
rain. "I haven't a thing local, but
that's the least of our troubles, for I'll
get them. Let me see (whipping out a
potfket pad): Maynard McFie is Aga

That's not many. I'll round them all

And as I ran for the train I heard
her call "Hello, is this Ajax? This is
Tecmessa. Come over and have a cup
of chocolate at 12 to-morrow, won't
you? and incidentally have your picture
'took.' "
ed with the greatest care. In the 1
first place, if yc-u will take the pains
to look, the material is not cheap and
flimsy, and it ought not to be. for I paid
four dollars a yard foil some of it. The.
trimmings, too, were nearly all made
by hand of a heavy felt and appliqued
on. for I absolutely detest cheap imi
tations. However, this was not what
I intended to say. This," tossing a gay
buff toward a bean of somber colors,
"poes with that pile. Do you see any
difference?"
"One is brighter than the others," I
vouchsafed.
"That," with a contented smile, "is
just it. The important character in
each scene is dressed with the view of
making him stand out clearly defined
and more conspicuous than his fellow
men, while the chorus is garbed in neu
tral tints, so it will not project itself
too prominently by reason of Its dress.
While it is in evidence during the
greater part of the play, it is, well â
just the chorus." .
"Big or little?" I asked. "Evidently
big. Judging from the looks of this
room."
In the first place Ajax is modern in
one sense of the word, because Its
"Yes, big. Full one hundred and
fifty. And, by the way, that reminds
me. We are to have an Athenian au
dience. You know that is one of the
suppositions, but in this case 'the
original idea is to be carried out. The
amphitheater is divided into two sec
tions. The first one, in reality a part of
the stage, is to be filled with students
in costume and their picturesque dress
will lend a touch of realism that will
be most effective. Of course you know
the play." she added, and I haven't yet
decided in my own mind whether that
was Just a subtle feeler or merely an
afterthought.
"Of course" I did, after a fashion,
but if the average person possesses 'as
limited a knowledge of the "Ajax of
Sophocles" as I, it won't do any great
harm to dilate upon it for a minute or
so.
By Mad^e Moore.
gERKKLEY has a new bee In her
bonnet. Not content with em
ploying every methed known to
modern science to peep into thÂ«
future, she must turn fairly and
squarc-Iy about and delve into ages
long gone by.
In fact, this self-same delving has
scheduled her to take a flying trip
backward. So far back, by the way,
that she passes the period of mediae
vallsm and "lands with much ado some
four hundred years before Christ. And
the direct cause of this sudden flight
is nothing more or less than the return
cf the old Greek drama with its re
ligious inspirations, its simplicity of
construction and its general beauty and
harmony.
When the old morality play "Every
man" was first presented the theater
goers were amazed, but when they
were bidden to "Ajax." one of the best
known tragedies of the ancient Greek
dramatist Sophocles^ they bowed their
heads and went cs lambs to the
slaughter.
For "Ajax." be it known to Â»*â¢Â» un
initiated, begins with the killing of
rnany cattle and ends with the shed
ding of blood â a veritable slaughter,
indeed.
As the rirst production of this classic
was led and directed by Mabel Hay
Barrows, so will this one be, for she
Journeyed across the continent to train
the students in their respective roles,
to costume the play and to see that it
is staged as it should bo. â¢
In the meantime she is tucked away
in a cottage at the foot of the hills
calling the clerk of the weather all
s>ort*> of queer-sounding names for
treating her so shabbily, for outdoor
plays, even though they are given in
ideal Greek amphitheaters, do not agree
very heartily with torrents of rain.
When I dropped the knocker on the
door 1 wondered rather vaguely wheth
er ehe could let me and my baby
rivulets in vr not. for I was as wet as
a drowned cat and just about as com
fortable.
In a n:inute the door swung hospi
tably open and there stood the quaint
est type of girl I have ever seen. Her
frock was of r. soft gray cut in neither
the fashion <Â»f to-day nor yet of yes
terday; htr hair, snugly braided, was
wound about her head Grecian style
and ftltosclher she looked as though
she rr.isht think in Greek and speak in
Lstin.
.But ?he didn't do either. She just
FmiJed and vpencd the door a little
wider.
"Ccrne right In or we'll be flooded"
v. as what fhe said, and ushered me
into a t-ozy sitting-room. As I looked
about for something: tffat I could sit
on with safety she must have caught
the drift of "AJax" and "paper" for
the said "Oh." in an expressive man
ner and the next minute found me
marching upstairs to dry stockings and
varm slippers, and it was not until a
bowl of hot soup was steaming away
in front of me that she leaned for
ward and said: "Now, what do you
want?"
If one is to judge from appearances,
this is the way Miss Barrows handles
everything that chances her way â from
a stray individual to a complicated
Greek drama.
"Your own students are the recruits,
you know, don't you?" she queried as
she looked ud a picture. "And," she
added, with an amused little laugh,
"I'm perfectly satisfied in my own mind
you would recognize the boys any
where, for I've been struggling to keep
them from cutting their hair. Long
hair, curled. Is better and more com
fortable than any wig on the market
and it always gives a touch of realism
that Is difficult to obtain otherwise."
And this Is one of the secrets of Miss
Barrows', success. She wisely adheres
to traditional ideas in the Homeric cos
tume* and ehe gives them every touch
of realism that she possibly can, even
to bare arms and legs, and it may be
said with more than a degree of truth
that the artificial Greek substitutes
wear the classic costumes even as those
born under the sunny skies of Greece
Itself.
About me, piled high on all sides,
â¢were costumes of every color and every
description. Vivid backgrounds out
lined and brought into sudden reMef by
braids of silver and gold, but with all
the gay tones there was not even y.z
much as a suggestion of anything
gaudy, or tawdry.
"You furnish all the costumes?" I
esked. picking up a deep red, trimmed
with a buff border.
"Yes, everything. And I want to
make one point clear In your mind.
Every one of these," waving a hand to
a stack feet high, "has been select-
maker was the first master dramatist
to introduce more than two actors and
to make use of painted scenery. More
than this, he Ignored the ancient tra
dition that death must be hidden from
the audience, and In a clear, concise
fashion shows the sudden madness, the
pathetic remorse and the calm suicide
of the great warrior.
Briefly then the story is this: When
Odysseus Is carefully studying foot
prints in the sand, the voice of Athena
is heard telling him that Ajax, whom
he is evidently in search of, has slain
the cattle and their keepers in a fit of
madness, which she herself had cast
upon him, that he might slay the cat
tie instead of the Greek chiefs-^-Odyss
eus, Agamemnon and Menelaus, as he
had hoped to do. To prove her state
ments true she calls Ajax from the tent
with a blood stained scourge in his
hand3 and boastful triumphs on his
lips.
When the followers of Ajax hear of
his frenzy they rush to hl3 tent, calling
on him .to come forth and clear his
good name, assuring him that they be
lieve it all base slander and even going
so far as to say " 'Tis on the powerful
that envy creeps."
All this, however, has no effect upon
Ajax, for after the madness passes ha
is cast into deepest melancholy and
prays his friends to mercifully slay
him/ for in his eyes this shame has
blotted out all his glorious deeds.
Tecmessa, his wife, does all that lies
in her power to rouse him, but his
sole reply is to bid her bring their boy,
in order that he may bid him farewell.
This done, he gives minute instruct
tions as to his burial and silently seeks
his own counsel.
! Just about this time a messenger
arrives from the enemy's camp telling
how the Greeks have planned the death
of Ajax aHd his brother Teucer. Cal
chas, the seer, has predicted to Teucer
that if Ajax can be kept in his tent this
day only the anger of Athena would be
averted. The followers, accompanied
by the messenger, seek Ajax and are
filled with sudden dismay to learn that
he has already left his tent, going no
one knows whither.
Tecmessa, fearing the worst, arouses
the men to action and In a twinkling

C"T*t O dress well is a social duty.
I Every educated, self-respecting
I voman is bound to clothe her
JL person as neatly, as tastefully
and becomingly as she can. But just
as a virtue, when carried to excess de
velops into a vice, so the art of dress-
Ing well, when,allowed to overstep its
legitimate uses'and expenditures, eas
ily runs into folly and madness. The
reckless extravagance of woman\s
dress at the present day is little short
of criminal Insanity. A feverish de
sire to outvie one another in the man
ner and make of their garments ap
pears to possess every feminine crea
ture whose lot in life places her out
side positive- penury. The inordinate
ly wealthy, the normally rich, the
well to do middle class and the shab
by genteel are all equally infected by
th*Â» Fame hysterical frenzy. And it is
a frenzy which is humored and en
couraged on all sides by those who
should have the sense, the intelli
gence and the foresight to realize the
danger of such a tendency and the
misery to which in many cases it is
surely bound to lead.
Latterly there have been certain
growlings and mutterings of discon
tent from husbands who have had to
pay certain unexpectedly long bills
for their wives' "crea
tions in costume" â
but, as a matter
of fact, it is reallv the men who are
chiefly to blame for the wicked
waste of money they afterward
resent and deplore. They are the
principal instigators of the mis
chief â the aiders and abettors of th*
destruction of their own credit and
good name. For they openly show
their admiration of women's clothes
more than the women clothed â thnt is
to say, they are more easily captured
by art than nature.- No group of male
flatterers is ever seen round a woman
whose dress is unstylish or otherwise
out of date. She may have the sweet
est face in the world, the. purest na
ture and the truest heart, but the
"dressed" woman, the dyed, the ar
tisiicalfy f 'f>ked" woman wil^
nearly always score a tri
umph over her so far ps
masculine aporeciation
and attention are con
cerned.
The "faked" wo
man has every-
ting well burned In
the fires of loss
and disaster. For,
in any case, it may
be taken for grant
ed that theyalways
charge a double,
sometimes treble,
price for a gar
ment or costume,
over and above
what that garment
or costume is really
worth, and one
may safely pre
sume they base all
their calculations
on possible loss.
It is no uncommon thing to be told
.hut such and such an evening blouse
>r bodice copied "from 'the Paris
nodel" will cost 40 guineas. "We
night possibly do it for 35," says the
:ostumer meditatively, studying with
veil assumed gravity the small, flimsy
>bject he is thus pricing, a trifle made
ip of chiffon, ribbon and tinsel gew
raws, knowing all the while that
jvervthing of which It Is . composed
:ould be purchased for much less than
ilO. Twenty-five guineas, 45 guineas,
55 guineas are quite common prices
or gowns at any of the fashionable
shops to-day. One cannot, of course,
ilame the modistes and outfitting
Irm3 for asking these absurd fancy
?rices if they can get them. If worn
;n fire mad it Is perhaps wise, jusi
Â»nd reasonable to take financial ad
vantage of their madness while it
as.ts. Certainly no woman of well
aalanced brain would give unlimited
prices for gowns without most care
ful inquiry as to the correct value ol
he material and trimming used foi
:hem, and the feminine creature whc
-uns into the elaborate showrooms ol
Madame Zoe or Berenice or Faustina
md orders frocks by the dozen, saying
:hjrpingly: "Oh, yes! You know hoA*
ihey ought to be made! Your taste
s always perfect! Make them ver>
pretty, won't you? Much prettier thar
:hose you made for Lady Claribel!
Yea, thankB 1 . I'll leave it all in your

Not very long ago there was held e
wonderful "symposium" of dress at th(
establishment of a certain modiste. Ii
tvas intensely diverting, entertainlnj
ind instructive. A stage was erected ai
Dne end of a long room, and on thai
stage, with effective flashes of lime
ight played from the wings at inter
i-als and the accompaniment of a Hun
garian band, young ladies wearin?
"creations" In costume stood, sat
turned, twisted and twirled, and finallj
walked down the room between rows o:
spectators to show themselves and th<
gowns they carried to the best possibl<
advantage. The whole thing was mucl
better than a stage comedy.. Nothinj
could surpass the quaint peacock-liki
vanity "of the girl "mannequins," whi
strutted up and down, moving thei
arms about to exhibit their sleeves ant
swayjng their hips to accentuate thi
fall; and flow. of flounces and draperies
It was a marvelous sight to behold, am
It Irresistibly reminded one of a part'
of impudent children trying on for fui
all their mothers' and elder sisters' bes
long dresses while- the unsuspeotlni
owners were out of the -way. There wa:

who bv virtue of having written twi
small and rather clever skits en thÂ»
manners, customs and modes of society,
is in some obliging' quarters of the
press called a "novelist."- â¢
It Is quite easy to drcsi well and
tastefully without spending a very
great deal of money. It certainly re
quires brain, thought, foresight, taste
and comprehension of the harmony of
colors. But the blind following of a
fashion because Madame This or That
cays It is chic or "le dernier cri" of
some parrot-like recommendation of the
sort, is mere stupidity on the part of
the followers. ' To run up Ions credit
for dresses without the least idea how
the account is ever going to be paid is
nothing less than a criminal act. It ts
simply fraud. And such fraud reacts
on the whole community. Extravagant
taste in dress is infectious. Most of us
are Impressed by the King's sensible
and earnest desire that the press
should use its influence for good in fos
terina amity and good will between
ourselves and foreign countries. If the
press would equally use its efforts to
discourage florid descriptions of dress
in their columns much of the wild and
willful extravagance which is frequent
'ly the ruin of otherwise happy homes
might be avoided. When Lady A seen
her loathed rival Lady B's dress de
scribed In half a column of newspaper
"gush" she straightway yearns and
schemes for a whole column of the
same kind. When simple country girls
read the amazing Items of the toilettes
worn by some notorious demi-mon
daine they begin to wonder how it is she
has such things and to speculate as to
â¢whether they â¢will ever be able to ob
tain similar glorified apparel for them
selves. And so the evil grows, till by
and by it becomes a pernicious disease
and women look superciliously at one
another, not for what they are. but
merely to estimate the quality and
style of what they put on their backs.
Virtue goes to the wall If It does not
wear a fashionable frock. Vice is wel
-comed everywhere If It Is clothed in a
Paris "creation." Nevertheless, Ben
Jonson's lines still hold good:
"Still to b# neat. tUU to b* .drest, â¢

"All is not sweet, all. Is not sound"
when women think little or nothing of
ordering extravagant costumes which
they well know they will never be able
to pay for unless through some dishon
orable means, such as gambling at
bridge, for example. Madame Modiste
is quite prepared for such an exigency,
for she does not forget to show "crea

purrs, are "suitable foF bridge par

suggestion one ex

lengthy "clothes"
article recently
published in a
dally paper will
BufHce:
"Among the numerous
evening and dinner
/gowns that the young
lady has in her corbeille,
one, a" l'lmperatrice Eugenie,
IS" very lovely. The founda
tion is of white liberty, with
a tulle overdress, on which are
four flounces of Chantilly lace ar
ranged in zig-zags, connected to
gether with shaded pink gloria rlb
-bons arranged in waves and wreaths.
This is repeated on the low corsage
and on the long, drooping sleeves of
the high bodice.
"A rich toilet is of white liberty silk,
with a flounce of magnificent Brussels
lace festooned by leaves of the chest
nut,- formed of white satin wrought in
iris beads and 'silver on white tulle.
The whole gown is strewn with like
leaves of graduating sizes, and the low
corsage has a bertha of Brussels lace
ornamented with smaller chestnut,
leaves, as are also the sleeves." And'
so on, In unlimited bursts of enthusi
asm.
I cannot say I am in the least sorry
wlien "modistes" who "create" cos
tumes at forty, fifty and even' one hun
dred and two hundred guineas per
gown, are mulcted of some of their un
lawful profits by defaulting creditors.
In nine cases out of ten- they richly
deserve it. They are rightly punished
when they accept with fulsome flat
tery , and servile obsequiousness a
"title" â¢ as sufficient guarantee for
credit, and in the end find out that
her Grace the Duchess or Miladi the
Countess are perhaps more wickedly
reckless and unprincipled than any
plain Miss or Mrs. ever born, and that
these grandes dames frequently make
use" of both rank and position to sys
tematically cheat their tradespeople.
The tradespeople are directly to
blame for trusting them, and this Is
daily and continuously proved. Eut
the touching crook-kneed worship uf
mere social rank still remains an In
gredient of the mercantile nature â it
is inborn and racial â a kind of
microbe in the blood generated there
in old feudal times, when all over the
world peddlers humbly sought the pa
trcnage and favor of robber chief
tains, and unloaded their packs in the
"castle hall" for the pleasure of the
fair ladles who were kept at home In
"durance vile" by their rough, un
washed lords. And so perhaps it has
chanced through, long custom and
heritage that at this present day there
Is nothing- quite so servile in all crea
tion as the spectacle of a "modiste" In
attendance on a Duchess, or a "ladies' Â¦
tailor" bending himself double while
deferentially ' presuming to measure
the hips of a Princess. It is quaint â
it is pitiful â it is intensely, dellciously
comic. ' And when the price of the
garment Is never clearly stated and
the bill never sent in for years lest
offense Is given to "her Grace" or "her
Highness"â by. firms that will, never
theless, have no 'scruples In sending
dunning letters and legalthreats to un
titled, ladlea, who may possibly kee.p
them waiting a little for their money,
but whose position and credit are
more firmly established than - those of
any "great' personages with handles to
tli'eir . names; it Is not without a cer
tain secret satisfaction, that one hears
of such fawning flunkeys of trafle get-
Â¦
Â»thlng on her side.
: 'fhe drama supports
her. The ' press en
courages her. Whole
columns in seemingly sane Journals are.
devoted to the description of her at
tire. Very little space is given to the
actual criticism of a new play as a
play, but any. amount of room is'
awarded to glorified "gushers" con
cerning the actresses' gowns. Of course
it has to be borno in mind that the
"writing up" of actresses' gowns serves
a double purpose. Firstly, the "crea
tors" of the- gowns are advertised and
may in their turn advertiseâ which, in
these days of multitudinous rival news-,
papers, is a point not .to be lost sight
of. Secondly, the actresses "themselves
are advertised and certain gentlemen
with big noses, who move "behind the
scenes", and' are the lineal descendants
of Moses and Aaron,' may be thereby
encouraged to speculate in theatrical
"shares." "Whereas criticism of the
play itself . does no good to anybody
nowadays, not even to the dramatic
author. For If such criticism .be un
favorable, the public says it is written
by a spiteful enemyâ if eulogistic, by a
"friend at court," and they accept
neither verdict. They go to see the
thing for themselves and If they like It
they keep on going. If not, they stay
away, and there's an end.
But to the sowns there 1b no end.
The gowns, even in an unsuccessful
play, are continuously talked of, con
tinuously written about, continuously
Bketched in every sort of pictorial small
and great, fashionable or merely pro
vincial. And the . florid . languageâ or
shall we say the "fine writing?"â used
to describe clothes generally, on and
off the stage. Is so ravingly sentimen
tal, so bewilderingly turgid, that it can
only compare with the' fervid verbosity
of the early eighteenth-century roman
cists, or the biting sarcasm of Thack
eray's "Book of Snobs," from which
the following passage, descriptive of
"Miss Snobky's" presentation gown,
may be aptly quoted: . ' ' ,
"Habit de cour composed of a yellow
nankeen illusion dress, over, a slip of
rich pea-green corduroy, trimmed en
tablier with boquets of " briissels
sprouts, the body and sleeves hand
somely trimmed with calimanco and
festooned with a pink train and white
radishes. Headdress, carrots and lap
pets." \ .
By way of a modern pendant to the
THE MADNESS
OF
CLOTHESroom, sit wearily down and mechani
cally place his feet on the rounds or
perhaps the seat- of the chair imme
diately in front of him. He imagines
that rests him. Instead he istdnly tiring
himself Just -that much more, for the
muscles of his legs. Instead of being
relaxed, are uqder a strain and while
he does not realize just what the
trouble is he will nine times out of
ten get up with an impatient "I'm more
tired than I was before."
If you want to elevate your feet do
It properly and then calmly sit and
derive the benefits of it. In the first
place, in sitting one thing should be
done. Always sit as far back on the
seat as you can â and, by the way, do
not cross the legs. This in itself Â«ives
you a broader basis to sit on and tends
to quiet the nerves. Draw the second
chair up near you and place the soles
of your feet against the rounds of the.
back, taking care to see that the knees
are supported on the seat, for in this
way the strain is_removed and you are
free to rest comfortably as long as you
WilL
You see that nothing fried or sreasy
is aljowed. for thi3 diet is to promote
health, physical visor and force, and
only the simplest focda cooked in the
plainest way are permissible.
The exercises here portrayed are ex
cellent ones for home use. No. 1 clasps
the wand, palms outward, bending the
right leg over and alternating with the
left. Then straighten up with the wand
In the rear and swins wand over the
head in front of the body. Repeat this
over again and straighten up as In
figure 2.
The windmill exercise bends you for
ward and keeps the arms rigid and op
posite each other as in flsure Z. At the
same time bend the left knee and touch
the floor between the heels. Then
swing lightly from side to side.
The rocker, figure 4, reduces a big
stomach and develops the abdominal
muscles and at the same time straight
ens the small of the back and makes
one more fit.
There is just one more exercise that
I especially want to mention and if
more women would devote a few min
utes a day to this one movement there
would be a scarcity of pains and aches.
Lie down full length on the floor as in
figure 5. Roll the body along the floor
and back again and by thl3 time you
will have discovered that the pressure
comes on the weak, inner organs. This
exercise, by the way, has no muscular
effect, but It makes the digestive
organs strong and renders colic utterly
impossible.
I have spoken of health of thÂ» body
and the carriage of the body as the dis
tinct alms of physical culture, but it i3
scarcely fair to stop there, for It really
Is- three-fold in its mission, as it gains
us what the old poet prayed forâ "a
scund mind in a sound body."
This holds good In lying down as
well. It Is such a frequent thins to go
into the house, curl up on a cozy couch
with a book nnd let one or both feet
hang over the edge. Sometimes it Is
because we have a wholesome fear of
being canght with our boot3 on the
cover and then again it Just happened
so. But don't let it occur frequently.
Instead of spending money on doctor
bills, *buy a new couch cover now and
then for it will be infinitely cheaper in
the long run to bottle up your energy
than it will be to keep a spotless cover.
These little things are rut much in
themselves, but the7 frequently add
their mite at precisely the wrong mo
ment and the result is disastrous. The
little things are what makrs and keeps
good health. Just as soon as the body
is run down it seml3 out a special in
vitation to Mr. Disease to come avisit
ing and you are in no condition to* or
der him away. Keeping one's self in
good condition means escaping a host
of ailments, for pains and woes are
ever on the alert to find a weak spot
and as soon as they spy one they sÂ»ally
forth, bag and baggage and camp there
Just as long as they possibly canâ in
fact, until they are forcibly ejected.
What you eat has mere or less to do
with your condition, though if you
have trained your stomach muscles
properly you can almost rival the in
vincible ostrich.
Athletes who are in training have a
certain diet and I will Rive it to you
in order that you may see how plainly,
yet how well they live.
Breakfastâ Fruit: oatmeal or cracked
wheat with a little milk, boiled or
poached eggs, baked potatoes, stale
bread or toast with butter.
Dinnerâ Roast or boiled meats, cab
base, carrots, parsnips or other whole
some vegetables plainly cooked.
Supper â Cold meats, poached esss.
baked potatoes, cold stewed fruit and
stale bread.
FLYING MACHINE THAT FLIES
thgre ought to be exercise for the entire
body, or else there will be a case of
over and t under development.
These days the variety of exercises
open to women are almost as great as
to men. The graceful horsewoman, the
leng-distance skater, the strong swim
mer, the vigorous oarsman, the brisk
v/alker, all mean one and the same
or two or three. It will not hurt you.
On the contrary, the benefit of such
a walk should be immediate and mark
ed. Of course, if you hold. your head
down, draw your shoulders together
and slouch along like a whipped cur
you are not going to gain much; but
if you inhale long breaths through the
nose and not through the mouth, and
walk smartly and briskly the pulses
should quicken and the tired body for
get its woes, and instead there should
be a feeling of exhilaration that ' is
bound to come with good health. ' 1
And while I think of it I want to tell
you a little something about sitting
down and standing up.. How many of
you .have seen a Â¦ tired man 'enter? a
cloth at top and bottom. It is buoyant
enough of Itself to float its own weight
and that of one man. During their
.three years of experiments, the broth
ers had added considerably to their
knowledge of air currents and of the
resistance of canvas. Keeping , these
things in view, they designed and built
their propelling apparatus. One pro
peller, revolving horizontally, is placed
underneath the center of the machine's
than forty feet from tip to tip. and it
weighs, entirely equipped, about seven
hundred pounds. The achievement
marks an impressive step in advance
toward the every-day navigation of
the air.
..The test in question was made at
Kitty Hawk, in North Carolina. In the
neighborhood of which place the ma
chine was. launched from the top of
a high sand dune. The aeroplane first
took a downward course, but as the
propeller under the engine increased
its revolutions, began to rise slowly
and steadily into the air. When the
machine was sixty feet â¢ above the
ground the rear propeller began to
do Its work, sending the "flyer" for
ward against the wind. Wilbur Wright
was able to steer his craft as he
pleased, with the aid of the horizontal
steering csar â a3 shown in our illus
tration â and after golns three miles
brought the machine gentry to the
ground without difficulty or mishap.
Professor Langley and Maxim ex
perimented along the Hne3 of a real
flyinj machine, as distinct from the
dirigible balloon3 of Santos-Dumont
and Lebaudy. But the eminent scien
tist and the brilliant Inventor, with
fortunes at their disposal, have not
been rewarded with the success of
these amateurish mechanicians. A ma
chine, not a hiie. th^t propels Itself
against a strong v.in<l. b under steer
age control, and lands without con
verting itself into a scrap heap, la
something new under the sun. â Col
lier's.
TO sail three' miles through the
air at a speed of eight miles
an hour against a breeze
blowing twenty-one miles an
hour is the most notable achievement
in flying-machine experiments. Three
years ago, two brothers named Wright,
of Dayton, Ohio, went down among the
sandhills of the North Carolina coast.
They, were expert mechanics, and
brought their own tools and machinery.
They had studied the experiments of
flying-machine inventors here and
abroad. Â¦
The machine, in which the operator
lies at full length, is in some ways like
a box. kite with a rudder Instead of a
tail. The framework is covered with
body. The other is like the screw of a
steamship, whirling vertically at the
rear. .
The machine is launched from a
hill by merely "pushing off." It can
be .pointed in any direction and can be
landed at will, it is strong enough to
stand the strain of repeated trips, and
its wings have been tested with- six
times the load they carried last
month. The horizontal position of the
man in the machine saves about one
half horsepower by diminishing the
ivind resistance. The Wrights have
used larger cloth surfaces than their
predecessors. Their successful ma
chine has. three hundred square feet
of cloth. The wings measure more
thing^rosy, healthy women, who know
nothing of nerves, but spend the day
happily and profitably. And these wo
men are the Jolllest kind to meet, too.
There are scores of girls who are full
â¢of fun and who are not only willing
but eager, to partake in the day's pleas
ure. They start out happily and mer
rily, but after a short time fatigue
commences to steal over them and if
they are unable to turn back they are
soon mentally and physically exhaust
ed and every one within a radius of ten
blocks. Is made to feel the weight of
their displeasure.
Now, such girls are unpopular, and
deservedly so, too. Great and unusual
strength is not to be desired, but they
should be equal to the task of getting
the most and the be.st out of life, es
pecially when It rests with them
whether they will use the means to
gain it or not
If you are down town, walk home In
stead of riding. What if It is a mils
troubles by the score. In walking the
liver is not materially aided one way
or the other, but the minute our arms
go over our heads or our bodies and
bent backward or forward, or to
either side for that matter, the liver is
squeezed and It is helped in its usual
work to a great extent. It is certainly
simple enough when one knows orreal
lzes this, Isn't it? So, you see, it really
pays to do things well or not to do
them at all. The very next time you
stoop to pick up a pin, bend over just
a little farther than usual and keep
that position a second longer and If It
is uncomfortable and you feel as
though you were going to have a rush
of blood to the head, think of the
squeezing your liver is getting and be
consoled.
Too much cannot be said of active
out-door exercise, for it will go far
toward, securing perfect health. But
you must bear in mind that it will only
develop the parts brought into play
and you can readily understand that
FOR some reason or otner, when
ever one speaks or physical cul
ture, or exercise In any form for
that matter, every one promptly
thinks of the gymnasium, or, worse
yet, the athletic field.
Now, that is not the only mode of
exercise by any manner of means, and
if you did but know it. all the appara
tus that one really needs to keep the
muscles of the body In good condition
are to be found within your own bed
room. Gymnasiums, If used systemat
ically and sensibly, are a paying prop
osition, but if you are willing: to search
for exercises you can readily find any
aiziount that will thoroughly test and
develop the entire body.
For instance, take an ordinary chair
and see what can be done with it.
Place it in an open space and lie down
en It, face downward, with the upper
part of -the less and the lower part of
the stomach resting on the chair. Nat
urally you will tilt back and forth a
little, but that is not the exercise.
Ftretch the arms out In front and the
lees in back and then see how high in
the air you can get them, or, in other
words, how much of a bow you can
make. Keep this position for a min
ute until you feel the muscles pulling
and stretching and then touch the
floor with both hands and feet relaxed.
A motion of this kind can be kept up
until it tires you, which, by the way,
â¢will not be long, but rest assured it will
make the muscles in the small of your
back and your hips so strong that you
will never have even as much as a
speaking acquair.tar.ee with backache.
Thera Is another movement that is
timple but very effective. Sit down in a
chair as usual and place your hands
oa the bottom of the chair and then
raise yourself as high as you can. This
'will pull the arms and chest vigorous
ly eÂ« the weight rests upon the arms.
As you gain strength, try another part
ef the same exercise that will call the
abdomen into activity. When you are
raised from the chair try to raise the
leg* and extend them In a horizontal
position and hold them there for a few
minutes.
Don't be discouraged if you cannot
accomplish this feat at first, for it is
most difficult and will only come with
hard, steady practice. All this time re
member that a goodly supply of pure
air Is absolutely necessary a,nd that
you will progress more rapidly it you
will acauire the habit of drawing in
deep, full breaths, filling your lungs to
their utmost capacity.
Another good exercise is to place two
chairs of an even height near enough
to serve as parallel bars. Raise and
lower the body until you are tired,
but draw a line between merelv tired
and tired out or exhausted. When one .
aids materially the other deters, and
It is never the part of wisdom to keep
at a. thing until It Is painful or dis
tressing in any way.
The ordinary stool Is a good instru
ment to work with, for it lends Itself
to all sorts and conditions of exercises.
For instance, put a couple of toe
etraps on the floor or baseboard and
draw the stool up near enough to slip
the toes through the snug openings.
Deliberately bend back until the head
touches the floor and then pull your
pelf Into a Kitting: posture again. If
you cannot do this with comparative
race try it cgain and again, for the av
erage person with ordinary strength
tbould find this little or no exertion.
To l-e pure the muscles will pull
ard probably make their presence
known the next day or so, but after the
first sharp tug: is over the movements
should not be painful.
There is scarcely a move that can be
made that does rot accomplish some

and not at all expensive. Yes, it Is

(Eudora).â Eyebrows that are so dark
and bushy that they give an ugly,

certainly distressing, but I think you
can do much to render them more* en
durable by careful training. They
should never be touched with oil un
less absolutely necessary; should they
be very stiff a trifle of oil will do no
harm. The daily application, during
years, of pomades and similar sub
stances has rendered your eyebrows ir
regular and promoted rapid growth,
for every tiny hair has been overnour
lshed. There are two effective ways of
restoring the contour of the brows.
RETARDING GRAY HAIR (Twen
ty-three)âThis subject has been given
consideration before in this depart
ment, but I am srlad to help you if I
can. I am sorry you- did not tell me
more' about yourselfâ your general
health, mode of living, etc., then I
might advise you better. It Is rather
unusual for. the hair to begin to turn
gray at twenty-three and I suggest
that you consult a skilled dermatologist
if one is within reach, and without de
lay. A thorough and skillful examin
ation of 'the scalp may reveal the
trouble and its cause. Grayness may
be. briefly classified as senile and pre
mature; for the former- there is no
remedy but dye, but Â¦ for the ' latter,
which occurs at any period before the
fortieth year of life as the result of any
disease of the scalp or body -which in-
BRIDE (Gifts).â A bride should ac

ble after she has received them. No, a
card is not sufficient. Instead write a
graceful little note thanking the donor,
for this; whe-n you stop to consider, \%
the least you could do under the cir
cumstances.
PROPERLY POWDERING THE
FACE (Violet)â The seemingly simple
things of life are those most habitually
neglected or, at best, imperfectly per
formed, and yet how often we note this
with a feeling of regret when some
trifle spoils an otherwise perfect" whole.
Powdering the face may seem, ridicu
lously easy and yet few know how to
do it well. A hurried dab with visible
traces of the powder everywhere is a
common fault. The woman who knows
the value of trifles puts thought and
delicacy of touch in the work, and this
is the secret of. success. She selects
a powder best suited to hec- natural
complexion, but never pure white no
matter how fair her. skin may be. The
darkest shade of cream Is best for the
average skin. Before arranging th*
hair the forehead, neck and other parts
next to the hair are to be powdered,
then any particles which settle on tha
hair may be brushed away when comb
ing the hair. Then, seated in a strong
light, the powder is deftly applied
over the entire faco and neck, and
hereon hangs the tale. Instead of rub
bing it in or twirling it on with a down
STAINED FINGER NAILS (Practi
cal)âHousekeepers who do more or
less of their own work exposing their
hands,- as they must, to extreme
changes of hot and cold water, find as
you do that the nails are the most dif
ficult part to keep clean. I, sympa
thize with your ambition to have pretty
clean hands and know how you : are
distressed over the nails which are so
badly stained underneath. I think,
however, a change in your way of car
ing for your hands will 5 work a change
in their appearance. Harsh acids are
largely responsible for much of the dis
coloration which cannot: be eradicated.
The delicate enamel which covers the
nail, designed to protect the fiber' from
stain, has been destroyed by the com
bined action of lemon Juice and alcohol,
hence the stains. The open -fibers ab

around the nails and under them; then
brush again with equal parts of lemon
juice and water, rinse and wash away
all the dry acid; then rub the nails, es
pecially underneath, with vaseline. At
night wear loose gloves with inside of
finger tips daubed with carbolated vas
eline to soften the nails, draw out the
remaining stain and induce a healthy
growth. . Prepare this lotion and rub
into the hands and nails several times
dally, after, washing. Mix one-half
ounce of glycerin, ten grains of tan

PfJZZLED ; (Remembering birth
days).âIt all depends upon how well
you know your friend. As a rule it is
not necessary to give a man a birth
day gift, but, as I said before, it all de
pends upon circumstances. A book is
always appropriate, but if you wish to
make it more personal, select soma
simple piece of Jewelry, such as a
watch ft?b or cuff buttons. They ara
not expensive and are not only nice to
have, but absolutely necessary.
MOTHER (Socks).â If yon want tÂ»
keep your small son in short socks
throughout the winter make soma snug

and put them on him when you taks
him out at night. In the win or
â¢when it is particularly cold. Whits
ones with white buttons are quite
smart, especially when worn with
white pique, but as they are difficult
to keen white and clean it is a good
thing to have a neat black pair on
hand.
MASSAGING A SCAR (Madeline)â
The scar on the face resulting from
lancing an abscess on the lower jaw
can be made less conspicuous by a dally
system of massage as soon as the
wound Is perfectly healed. The deep
Indentation which you fear will result
from the flesh adhering to the bone at
the point, of. puncture and to prevent
this exercise is absolutely necessary.
This keeps the tissues -free and by us*
ins a pure skin food in connection with
the massage the wasted tissues will be
built up and normal color more quickly
restored. To reach the minor tissues
and thus counteract the tendency to
fasten to the . bone the rotary move
ment is most valuable, finishing it with
a gentle picking up of the flesh be
tween the thumb and fingers to tone
up the relaxed muscles. Anoint the
ecar with the skin ' food, always pre
ceding this treatment by a warm face
bath, and with the finger tips per
form a rotary movement over the Jaw
bone, starting from the center of the
chin up to the temple, bestowing extra
care on the scar. Then repeat, plac
ing the fingers a trifle higher up, con
tinuing until the entire cheek ha3 been
gone over ' several , times, terminating
each time at the temple; then resort to
the gentle kneading and- picking up of
the flesh. Several times daily you may
gently knead the tissues by placing the
finger on the scar and moving it from
side to side. Three or four revolutions
each time will ba sufficient.

should be patted on very gently. The
correct motion Is a direct pat against
the skin; this prevents a rough patchy
look which is caused by the- powder
lodging on the slightly roughened cuti
cle; either a sliding upward or down
ward stroke will produce it. If inad*
vertently any powder clings and shows,
white lines, a tiny sponge moistened is
wiped over the spot, which is then re
powdered. A tiny brush removes any
powder from. the eyebrows ' and lashe^
and incidentally keeps the arch of th^
former In a perfect curve. -The fastldi
oub woman, realizing the possibility of
impurities in the ordinary powderpuiT,
selects either the inexpensive puffs .of
Turkish cloth, which may be cleaned or
thrown away often, or buys' a half

cotton and uses a small wad each time,
thus insuring absolute cleanliness.
It goes without saying that every
man likes a coquette. There is some
thing irresistible about the lassie who
knows how to hand a cup of^taa. with a
smile, who can turn aside an : awkward
remark at the right minute, or who
can relieve an unpleasant situation
without an Instant's nesitation. To
ordinary man all these parlor tricks
border on the magic, and he cannot
offer her his hand and heart soon
enough.
If you Miss Up-to-Date would bÂ«
honest with yourself you would admit
that your manners like your frocks
are chosen to please a man or. may -be
men. So it probably wouldn't do . any
harm to get on his side of the looking
glass and observe yourself as you real
ly are. You wear a pose as you would
a colorâ because you consider it be
coming. If you would only take the
trouble to remember that man admires
gentleness, modesty and cordiality,
your trials and tribulations would be
greatly diminished, for these qualities
should be natural. ! Even if . they , are
not, they may be cultivated a.nd it is
well worth while for they sum up the
masculine idea of feminine manners..
On the other hand avoid being: a
prude,- for she is about the limit, you
know. If you are eternally and forever
looking for trouble you are almost sure
to find it, and the girl who goes about
with a chip on her shoulder waiting for
an opportunity to snub a man is about
the most distasteful bit of femininity
that a man can meet in a month of
Sundays. Try to : be jolly and. genial
and natural and you can't go far
wrong. Assumed haughtiness Is cor
dially hated by everybody, while quiet
dignity never fails to be admired:

with floss or tiny steel beads. ' Tho

white suede thickly studded with mock
jewels and embroidery, and worn with
black or white gowns the effect is par
ticularly good. The cutest little straps

with several small or one largÂ« metal

touch to the golf skirt or scarlet vest.

TRAVELER (Hand Bags).âWhat
ever else you economize on, do not da
it on traveling-bags. There Is some
thing very ordinary looking about
cheap suit cases, bags and trunks. As
a rule the English made hags arÂ© thÂ»
bcst.the most commodious and thÂ© most
serviceable, so it is an economy in thÂ«
long run to purchase them. The price
all depends upon the size and thÂ«
leather. For a lady I should say *. 40
inch tray trunk would not bÂ« amiss
and you should get a good on* for
twenty or twenty- two dollars. A suit
case depends upon the linen or leathe?
lining, but you can get one plenty good
and one that will last years for twelvs
or fifteen dollars. Do not bÂ« foolish
enough to think this high priced, for It
really Is not as you will discover tea
years hence.
give. I remember hearing a girl say
she had liked a certain chap until
she saw him eat ice cream from the
end of a spoon and then "sort of lick
it off." Surely, that was not a hid r
eous offense, but such is the perversity
of human nature.
And so |t is with man. When you
make yourself ridiculous in any man
ner he . considers your conduct out
rageous and is ready to annihilate you.
In fact, he will pardon you more read
ily for a crime than for making a spec
tacle of yourself; more easily for wil
fully treading on his heart than awk
wardly treading on his dignity. He
will declare until he is blue In the
face that he doesn't care a rap about
"good form," but beware of slipping
up on "good manners." for from his
viewpoint this is unpardonable and un
forgivable.
Man likes to feel his ov/n importance
and eo he demands feminine manners.
He doesn't go in for sweaters, shirt
waists and independence. No. That
reminds him too much of himself and
he isn't flattered with the imitation.
The girl who can take care of herself
may be refreshing at times, but she isn't
good as a steady diet, for she takes
away that gratifying sense of protec
tion that he likes to feel toward a
pretty woman. He doesn't enjoy being
treated as though he were of minor
consequence and a little something
that could be dispensed with entirely.
And then, too, he does not especially
enjoy the brusque fashion In which ho
is more than apt to be treated. In
short, he resents it for the world and
all like a cat whose fur has suddenly
been brushed the wrong way.
Don't think it Is the masculine girl' he
objects to, but tho masculine way in
which Khe does things. He demands
gentleness and he sets a generous dose
of brusqueness. â¢
So you see it Is a better paying prop
osition for you to wearti trailing skirt,
a picture hat and a becoming amount
of gentleness. To be sure, the ma
jority of men do not condemn a woman
then and there if they chance to hear
her say "damn," but it Is an unpleas
ant surprise and one that they do not
forget readily. It may be all fine and
daisy to have a companion who can
walk miles In the country, who can
ride like a fiend and who can rough it
as well if not better than he can. Yes,
the is a Jolly good fellow, but you
couldn't see him for dust if any one
proposed that he walk to the altar
with her. Not for him. The childish
youngster who understands the art of
holding up yards of fluffy lace and who
cannot hem without asking his advice
is the one he invites to accompany him
on this Journey, and he thoroughly
enjoys being her faithful Fldo. for Bhe
has a charming, artless way of tickling
his vanity. Flatter a man and you can
do almost anything with him. He needs
smoothing and soothing with an occa
sional scratch just by way of contrast.
You cannot bluff him half so easily as
you can wheedle him. In fact. If you
are past master In the art you can
nearly always wheedle *a man into
falling in love with you.
. Flee from loudness in any form as
you would flee from a deadly pest. It
Is worse than foolish to wear gaudy
apparel, to saturate yourself with per
fume and then to cap the climax by
talking for the benefit of the entire
room or car. A man may. turn about
and look at you, may even ogle you,
but he is thinking "heavens, another
freak turned' loose!" Rest assured he
isn't thinking anything complimentary.

petticoats six inches higher than is ab

paper readers and art enthusiasts In
general the really splendid and high
ciass work that can be accomplished by
these hard worked newspaper artists
when they take a brace and knuckls
down. Incidentally lovers of fine work
will have amplo opportunity to buy.
Last year the' league received such
encouragement that they decided to
follow in the footsteps of the Eastern
artists and hold an annual exhibition
of their work, both for competitive ana
practical purposes, and so well havÂ«
they paved the way that the prover
bial stumbling block, whose chief duty
in life Is to annoy and disturb genius,
is absolutely non est. . Â¦
and yet there is a degree of art In it
that Is little short of wonderful. In
fact, he realizes that if he would get
recognition of his work he must put a
certain amount of excellence of execu
tion in It and that It must have the
idea behlnd^lt.
It may be. all well enough and good
to amuse the fickle public a minute or
so daily, but this is not the ambition
of the newspaper illustrator. Nine out
of ten ..aspire to magazine and book
work and when that step has been
achieved they long and dream of the
day when the wolf can be kept away
and the * larder supplied by the skill
of the brush and not the pen. This,
forsooth, is one^ reason why he tries
his hand at a little of. everything-^pen
and pencil, wash,; water colors and oil3,
first one and then another, to see which
medium is best adapted fof his own
particular style of "work.
And so it is that the everyday light
ning artist is slowly but surely work
ing his way to prominence in his chosen
profession. -Almost in the dark, as it
were. for,, while he is experimenting
and gaining, the world sees his hurried
sketches of dally, happenings and gives
his ability scarcely more than a pass

THE newspaper artists are to the
fore again and seem unusually
pleased Â¦with themselves for be

their glory is just this. Beginning on
the eleventh day of October they vir
tually own the Maple Room of the Pal
ace â and incidentally everything that
is in it. For, be it known to the unin*
itiated. their second art exhibition will
be opened with the flourishing of trum
pets, and every man Jack in the length
and breadth of this city who follows
the difficult row of newspaper or mag
azine illustrations will be represented.
And well represented, too, for he has
put forth his best work and has han
dled subjects of every description and
worked in every "medium," from pen
and ink to oils.

Wife of Russian Lieutenant Colonel

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 8.â The
following letter, published In the press
to-day from the widow of an officer
killed at Liaoyang, illustrates the
present position of many Russian
families. The writer Is Mme. Nadlne
Ryndine, residing at Kieff. She says:
"My husband, a lieutenant colonel

Wyck of New York, who sailed on the
Baltic, rubbed, Londoners the wrong
way by an interview he gave out be
fore his departure, in which he com
pared London with Berlin to the dis
advantage of the former. London, he
said, had been standing still for a
score of years. It had no parks, no
pleasures beyond eating, drfnklng and
theater going. Many sarcastic com
ments have been made on the New
Yorker's pronouncement, and Van
Wyck is urged to open his eyes when
he next comes to the British metrop

| DEAD NOVELIST AND TWO OF THE WOMEN FIGHTING FOR HIS ESTATE. |

British Scientists Say That Loud
Speakers Scatter Millions of
Germs fn Atmosphere.
LONDON, Oct. 8.â A new terror has
been added to the public life of the
average politician who finds the effort
of addressing his constituents a tire
some performance. Now It Is learned
on no less an authority than that of the
medical department of the local gov
ernment board that he may not only
bore himself and his audience, but that
he may prove the medium of dissem
inating Infection.
"As the outcome of varied and re
peated experiments," says Dr. Mersyn
Gordon of the local government board,
"it has been well substantiated that not
only in the act of coughing and sneez
ing, but also In the act of loud speak
ing, fine droplets of mucus are sprayed
from the mouth to the air, that they
float in the air and that they may be
wafted by air currents such as obtain
in ordinary rooms to a distance that
appears at first sight almost Incredi
ble."
"Micro-organisms," said a London
medical officer of health in confirmation
of Gordon's statement, "abound In the
respiratory passages and the mouth.
They remain there so long as they are
undisturbed, but are driven out In the
midst of the spray which is emitted in
the act of coughing, sneezing, singing
or loud speaking.
"Public orators, preachers and other
people who speak forcibly send out mil
lions of these organisms."
NEW PERIL DISCOVERED
CV OASIPAIGN ORATORY
bought Crafton House from Sir Ernest
Cassel and that it will be the scene of
the future King's turf operations.
Those who are in a position to know
something of the conditions of the
Prince's banking account do not hesi
tate to sav that he could not at the
moment buy a rabbit hutch, much less
a luxurious mansion and racing stables.
It is not long since it was publicly
stated that the Prince had had to sup
plement his Income In order to be able
to maintain Marlborough House, his
official residence. Sir Edward Cassel
is as generous where royalty is con
cerned as Baron de Hirsch was in his
best days, so there can be no danger of
early disaster to the Prince's turf un
dertakings.
Chroniclers of King Edward's move
ments during his present visit to Mar
ienbad have failed to notice the extra
precautions that are being taken \ to
secure his personal safety. The har
rassing of anarchists in London and in
England generally has so exasperated
the "comrades" abroad that his Maj
esty's advisers deemed it advisable to
undertake methods of protection which
had not hitherto been adopted during
any of the King's Continental trips.
The resignation of former Superinten
dent Melville as the head of the de
partment of the police service charged
with the safety of the sovereign is rec
ognized as a misfortune by the King's
advisers because that officer's knowl
edge of the ways of the Continental
anarchist was unique. His successor,
Mr. Quln, is an officer of wide experi
ence of the same class of criminals,
but he has not been able to strike so
much terror Into the hearts of the
"comrades" as Melville. Hence It is
that extra precautions are now neces
sary. The protecting guard on the
present occasion Is doubled and it is
noted as somewhat remarkable that
from the chief downward the majority
of the detectives in waiting on his
Majesty are Irishmen. With the as
sistance of a number of men supplied
locally, all roads and railway stations
leading to Marienbad are carefully
patrolled, while Chief Superintendent
Quin keeps his eye on his royal charge
constantly during the day and at night
two detectives well armed stand out
side his Majesty's bedroom. Until re-"
cently King Edward discouraged these
elaborate precautionary measures and
even now he makes no attempt to con
ceal the feeling that they are a mixed
blessing to him. The late Queen Vic
toria knew that she was one of the
most popular sovereigns in Europe, but
that feeling never prevented her from
making the most elaborate demands
upon Scotland Yard for her personal
safety and protection. AH the smartest
men had to be at her beck and call and
it was not .to the advantag-e of the
, chief if any of his nen were guilty of
the slightest dereliction of duty. Al
though it is considered a mark of honor
.to be recommended for the duty of pro
tecting the sovereign It was a distinc
tion not altogether relished by the men
Kha - watched: over . Queen .Victoria, -
grave another wreath which bore the
words, "Rosa from Bella." Later the
first wife's relatives reached the ceme
tery to place their floral offerings on
the tomb. They indignantly tore up
both of the wreaths that they found
there and sent the fragments to Jo
kai's home.
Jokai paid another visit to the ceme
tery and placed another wreath on his
wife's grave, but her rnfuriated rela
tives again destroyed it- Then Jokai
started legal proceedings against them
jind sought to rally public opinion to
his side by denouncing their conduct
in the press. But popular feeling, tak
little heed of the legal questions in
volved in the unseemly quarrel, unmis
takably proclaimed itself against him.
He was no longer the nation's idol.
Of late friends of the family have
been making strenuous efforts to bring
about a reconcilliation between Frau
Feszthy and Jokai's widow. There were
strong hoDes th*t these would be suc
cessful and that the details of Jokai's
family life might not be revealed in law
courts and published to the world.
Such hopes, however, are now almost
entirely dissipated through the ver
dict of the Jury impaneled to investi
gate the charges made by Frau Jokai
that the Feszthy family had behaved
badly toward Jokai ana consequently
had been disinherited. The jury found
that these charges were not proved
and they added further that they were
satisfied from the evidence laid before
them that the conduct of Frau Fesz
thy and her husband toward Jokal
had been uniformly correct and proper.
Jokai's widow is said to have taken
this defeat very badly and there is
little chance at present that any peace
ful compromise will be reached. The
Budapest courts will probably have to
decide the whole affair finally.
LONDON. Oct. 8.â The Countess of
Orford, formerly Louise Corbin of New
York, has gone with her husband, the
Earl, to fish in Norway, and society is
hoping that she will return cured of tho
illness from which she has suffered re
cently. The malady of the Countess'
has been the cause of no small social
embarrassment. She has seemed un
able to get enough sleepâ often dozing:
through the whole day as well as the
night. On one occasion recently, when
she and the Earl were to give a dinner
party â one of the smart affairs for
which they have been notedâ the guests
were kept waiting until, at 8:30, the
Earl had to confess to their guests that
his wife was still sleeping and that ho
did not like to rouse her. But the awk
wardness did not finish then, as the
Earl went on to ask If they would all
mind waiting at least until 8:45, as no
one but his wife knew how many guests
had been invited or at what time they
were expected to come to dinner. NonÂ©
of the servants had the slightest ink
ling as to the number expected and had
laid for twenty. Sixteen people, how
ever, turned, up, and after a trying de
lay "the guests and host proceded to this
dining-room, there to enjoy the dinner
party without the presence of their
hostess.
The Earl and Countess have taken
with them to Norway their little daugh.
ter, the Hon. Dorothy Walpole, and
the child owes It to her parents to be
come devoted to the rod, for the latter
are great disciples of Izaak Walton.
As a matter of fact, this sport holds
for them a far more romantic Interest
than it does for its'general devotees, as
it was while fishing in Scotland that
they first met.
The former Miss Louise Corbin was,
of course, the daughter of the American
railway magnate, and when she first
knew her husband he had not succeeded
to the earldom of Orford and was only
known as the Hon. Robert Horace Wal
pole. It was in 18S3 that Miss Corbin
became the Countess of Crford, and
soon after her marriage she and her
husband went oft to Florida tarpon
fishing off the coast, and it was during
this trip that Lord Orford got one of
the biggest tarpon ever taken. It
weighed 183 pounds. Lady Orford was
almost as successful as her husband,
for she returned having broken the
ladies' record in tarpon fishing.
The Orfords are a very old and his
toric family, the first Earl having been
none other than Sir Horace Walpole,
the great parliamentarian. The present
Earl of Orford began life in the navy,
but he did not rise above the rank of
sub-lieutenant, and in these latter days
the Norfolk militia has claimed all his
Interest.
Yankee Girl Who Mar
ried an Earl a Vic
tim of Odd Disease
BUDAPEST, Oct. 8.â Maurus Jokai's
estate Is the object of a very inter
esting family quarreL On the one
side stands the youthful widow of the
great Hungarian novelist, who is in
possession of the property; on the other
eide is Jokai's adopted daughter, who
is older than the widow, and who finds
herself disinherited. The contest over
the will has already begun in the courts
and the Budapest gossips are look
ing forward to some new revelations of
the domestic life of the great author.
Jckal married for the second time, at
the age of 75, an actress. Bells Weiss,
who was more than fifty-five years his
Junior, being only 19 at the time. He
had no children of his own, but had
adopted a daughter, who is now the
wife of a r>ai nter named Arpad Feszthy.
The new wife and Frau Feszthy soon
quarreled and the latter found herself
a very unwelcome guest at the Jokai
home. The marriage took place in
1893, and after that time Jokai's daugh
ter saw but little of him.
When Jokai's will was opened it was
found that he had left everything to
his wife and completely disinherited
Frau Feszthy, the document stating
that ample provision had been made for
her during his lifetime. Frau Feszthy
has filed a protest agrainst the will,
alleging; that Jokai was not his own
master at the time the will was made.
VALUE OF THE ESTATE.
Perhaps the most interesting point in
the case is the question as to the value
of the estate. The widow insists that
the poet died actually in debt, while
the daughter asscrtp tfri&. .is-ahsulutc
nonsense, and that the estate is worth
nearly a million kronen ($200,000). The
rstate was inventoried by a court
notary, who seems to have accepted
unhesitatingly all the widow's state
ments, ignoring the daughter's protests.
According to the latter's statement,
only a few articles of furniture were
put in the schedule. Valuable collec
tions of curios and pictures were not
mentioned, neither were the publishing
rights of the deceased, which Frau
Frszthy asserts have fifty years to run
and are worth at least half a million
kronen ($100,000). Among the pictures
was an oil painting by the famous Rus
sian war artist, Vereschtschagin, who
met with such a tragic end in the war
in the Far East. This picture was
dedicated to Jokai and bears the in
scription in the painter's own hand
writing. "To Monsieur Jokai." Its
value is put in the inventory at a few
kronen only. Jokai's country villa at
Fchwabcnberg. with a large park, is
put down at $1200, whereas Frau
FfEzthy declares it is worth over $20,-
Of'O.
Jokai's widow makes a vigorous an
pwor to these charges and attacks Frau
Feszthy very bitterly, threatening her
with Fomo unpleasant revelations as to
her treatment of her father.
The official notary's inventory of the
estate show? an indebtedness of $8000,
$5400 of which is due to Jokai's pub
lishers. Frau Feszthy's lawyers de
manded that a new inventory should
be made, hut this the court has refused,
so that the widow hits won the first
round in the contest.
MAIUUES .TEIVISII ACTRESS.
Jokai's first wife had been dead four
teen years when he married Mile. Belle
Weiss, an actress attached to the Na
tional Theater in Budapest, whose ac
quaintance he made at the rehearsal
of one of his plays. The courtship was
a brief one, for the aped author proved
an ardent wooer, but the disparity in
the ages of the couple exposed them to
much ridicule. It was this which led
Jokal to publish a defense of marriage
between old men and young women in
reneral, and of his own marriage in
particular.
The relatives of his first wife, of
whom he had written after her decease,
"She was the angel of salvation nvho
rescued me from exile and death, the
F.harer of all my sorrows, the pride of
my life." declared that it was an in
sult to her memory. The fact that his
youthful bride was an obscure actress
caused the marriage to be regarded
with strong disapprobation fn the high
social circles in which the great man
had long been a welcome guest, and
Â¦when it was discovered that she was
also a Jewess the anti-Semitic feeling,
which Is so strong- In Hungary, was
aroused against him. In consequence
he fell into disfavor, not only with the
court and aristocracy, but 'also with
the Magyar students, who had formerly
been his most enthusiastic admirers,
and the ever fickle public generally. No
longer did he receive invitations to ex
clusive court functions. When at other
gatherings he chanced to meet mem
bers of the imperial family, in place of
the warm greetings which he had been
accustomed to receive at their hands
he was treated with cold formality.
Many old friends ostentatiously ignored
him. Among those who remained true
to him not a few refused to receive his
wife, but the proud old man refused to
accept Invitations in which she was not
included.

who caused a sensation some time ago
by capturing a Conservative strong

Carnegie is fond of saying when either

LONDON, Oct. 8. â Those who know
the relations, public and private, that
existed betwen King Edward and the
late Baron de Hirsch are not surprised
that the Prince of Wales Is going to
start his racing career from the gener
ous millionaire's old house on Newmar
ket Heath. It ought to be sacred
ground to the heir apparent, for within
its luxurious walls many a little racing
matter and gamble was discussed by
the Baron and the present King* when
the latter could not command tha
wealth he can at present. If these same
walls could speak they could tell tales
of many a check drawn by the Baron
to satisfy royal racing deficiencies and
accounts, but the. good man was gen
erous to many outside royal circles and
if he showed extra consideration for
his most intimate friend, the Prince,
as Edward was then, it mattered not to
persons who were- pressing for settle
ment of racing accounts. It Is new
stated that the Prince of Wales has
anniversary of his first wife's death
after his second marriage that he was
made to feel the full measure of the
odium he had Incurred by wedding a
third rate Jewish actress. As had
been his custom on each anniversary
of his first wife's death Jokai drove to
the cemetery where she was burled to
pay a tribute to her memory. He de
posited on her grave a wreath which
bore the inscription, "Rosa, from her
ever-loving and ever-sorrowing hus
band, Maurus." His young wife, whom
he had taken with him, placed on the

loss Is increased by my complete in

I am unknown. My husband had been
all the time with the regiment in the
mountain service, being "with those
keeping back Kuroki's army. There
have been scarcely any newspaper
dispatches about this force, -which,
however, devotedly performed its role,

of what blood their father .merited."

Calumet Council of the Degree of
Pocahontas, organized by Dr. Charles
M. Troppmann of Calumet Tribe, was
instituted last week in the Red Men's
building with a charter membership of
127. the largest number with which a
council in this reservation has been in
stituted. The institution was by the
great Pocahontas, assisted by the other
great chiefs. The work of adopting the
palefaces was by the team of Manzan
ita Council and, while the team did not
have the electrical effects and other ac
cessories used in its own tepee, the
work was letter perfect and what was
lost by the inability to introduce the
side features was made up by the In
troduction of additional floor work, in
troduced by Drill Master George
Wheeler. During the evening Organizer
Troppmann, commenting on the work
of the team of which Mrs. Emma Rice
is the Pocahontas, said:
"I had heard a great deal about the
beautiful work by Manzanita's team,
but was under the impression that it
was more talk than reality, but after
what I have seen to-night I must say
that I take oft my hat to the members
of the team and if they did not create
a most profound impression on the
members of Calumet Council, I must
say that such members are not im
pressionable. My only hope is that the
team we Bhall organize in this council,
Calumet, may be able to do" as well as
has done Manzanita's team, better no
team can do. In the name of the baby
council, I thank Manzanita's team for
its assistance and good work and add
my mite to all the good things that
have been said about Manzanlta."
The adoption was followed by the
election of the chiefs who are to con
trol the council. Mrs. Emma D. Ralph,
a well known member of Keith Parlor
of the Native Daughters, was elected
Pocahontas; Miss May bell Troppmann
wag elected prophetess, and Alice Gray
keeper of records. These and the other
elected and appointed chiefs were then
installed, after which there was the
presentation of a miniature "grand
father" clock to the great Pocahontas
and one to the great Minnehaha for the
interest they, took in the - organization
Improved Red Men.
One of the bright members of WInona

netti to a parlor of the order was to

was accompanied by Grand Secretary
Laura J. Frakes, Grand Trustee Anna
F. Lacy and Grand Sentinel Agnes Mc-
Very. The hall was beautifully decor
ated with many American flags in
honor of Flag day. The color scheme in
the other decorations was red, symbolic
of the true sisterly love that exists in
that parlor. During the business ses
sion there was a demonstration of the
business methods, balloting and then
an exemplification of the ritualistic
work, all of which came in for a great
deal of praise. The programme was
made up of "America" sung by all pres
ent, an address to the flag by Minnie
Wells, "Patriotic Address" by Lena
Wilson, president of the parlor; "My
Native Land" by the members; "The
Old Flag," Anderson; "Star Spangled

cial march, known as the "Karoline
March," adopted at the session of the

ganist. During the evening the parlor

Last week a woman called on the
secretary of Templar Lodge and stated
that some years ago she forced her hus
band to take a withdrawal card out of
that lodge, because she did not think
much of it. But that after she had
seen the membership of that subor
dinate in the parade of Odd Fellows
she had changed her mind and was de

At the Saturday Morning Club In
Sacramento, where they do many fine
things unsuspected by their metropoli
tan neighbor, a recital that promised to
be noteworthy was yesterday given by
a Boston tenor, Wilhelm Heinrich. How
the recital went I have not yet heard.
Mr. H. Bretherick, organist of the
First Unitarian Church, sends me
the following interesting facts con
cerning: the singer, who may spend
some little time in our midst.
Mr. Frledrich is the tenor in Dr.
Everett Hale's church in Boston,
and was for ten years with Phillips
Brooks in like capacity. He has sung
with the famous Boston Symphony So
ciety, with the Cecelia Society, at the
New Bedford and Worcester festivals â
for where our dear Schumann-Heink
left us to sing â besides in concert "from
Maine to Florida." Mr. Heinrich is also
a Rood pianist and accompanies him
self. Last, sad fact, the singer is blind.
The enterprising little Saturday Morn
ing Club up there in Sacramento gives
Mr. Heinrich $100 for his services. Per
haps our Twentieth Century Club will
give us an opportunity to hear him.
ster by the wayâ gravely subjoined the
following: "My first appreciation of
music â and I recollect it distinctlyâ
was of a hand organ. It was below the
window in the street and 1 ran to listen
to it. At the same time I discovered
that I could hear it better if I put my
ear against the glass. . And I was just
three years old.*'
That was in Cracow, where the pian
ist was born. Later Hofmann went to
Warsaw, capital of the still unhappy
Poland. It was at three and a half
that "little Hofmann'8" fate was de
cided. He decided it thus remarkably
himself. His father went to Warsaw
to become a professor in the Warsaw
Conservatory and sold his piano before
going. Not being sure of staying very
long in Warsaw he thought that he
would not buy another instrument.
Master Josef decided otherwise.
"I said to my fatherâ he has told me
of It since quite frequently," related
the son â "that 'you would better buy
a piano or you will regret it once!" and
It so struck him that he bought one,"
Hofmann laughed.
And that, with mother teaching to
begin with, then some years with his
artist-father, put Josef Hofmann upon
the concert stage at nine years old, al
ready a remarkable little virtuoso. One
sister he has, "who used to play well,"
but, married now, "prefers the music
of her children."
Somehow we fell then upon the mod
ern composers, inevitably upon the
Russian school. Little for piano liter
ature, Josef Hofmann considers, is
composing anywhere outside of Rus
sia. Medtner, Liadow, Scriabine, par
ticularly, Sternberg and Rachmanin
off he instanced as the greater men of
the school. I remarked upon the coin
cident literary efflorescence, also the
art development, with the internal po
litical and social strife of the em
pire.
"Art is the child of struggle," Hof
mann remarked, "no strife, no art.
There must be compensations." His
after-sketch of the Russo-Japanese
conflict belongs rather to the editorial
page than here. It came with delight
ful oddity from the boyish lips â a
rapid, acute picture of conditions â Ger
many await to see which side wins
and treaty-bound to Russia, France
also furtively watching "our dear
cousin the Czar," the possibility of a
Chlno-Japanese alliance, and so on.
He came back to Italy after that
with Sgambatl as instance of the few
big modern composers for the piano
outside of Russia.
"What of the little Strauss?" I asked;
"the sonatas?"
"Too big- a canvas â orchestral, not
piano literature," Hofmann catalogued
it; "more color than form â decorative
art."
From Strauss to programme music
was but a step. I advanced that some
programme music was much worth
while.
"But" â Hofmann spread deprecatory
hands â " 'tisn't absolute music. One ob
jects to sign posts all over one's music.
This is this, that is that. Too muchâ
too much policeman! This you shall
feel, and this you shall not feel. Bah!
It is like being in a picture gallery
where a man at your elbow tells you ail
the time what to think. I like to think
what I like to think when I see pictures
or hear music. Imagine to be told what
to feel!"
He went on: "In real music it is left
open to one what to feel. And to each,
according to his temperament, it ap
peals differently. One makes one's own
pictures. It is a free art. Again. Take
away the programme cf your pro
gramme music and it ceases to inter
est. It is no longer beautiful. You
have been making the beauty yourself.
You need the advertisement with it.
And the actual thing can never be ex
pressed in music," he added.
"Almost," I ventured, thinking of the
orchestral water that laps over the
audience with the first measures of the
"Rheingold."
"Nay," and the philosopher looked
It is not for nothing that Josef Hof
mann has the whimsically lowered
right eye, the waywardly curved mouth
that lend such a Puck-like humor to
the face. Only at hand you get these.
The broad brow that governs them
dominates his platform face, the gen
eral masterly balance of the head. Sit
ting opposite, with the mischievous
sparkle of his brown eyes to further
the fancy, Hofmann seems sometimes
a very sprite.
He does the elfish thins, too, as I
have portended. Asked to pose at the
p!ano the other day when I went to
chat with him, ha sat down at the
treat Stelnway soberly enough. Then
he put out his wonderful little hands,
Trlth the cushioned fingers, to the key
board, touching it delioately.
A bit of the "Waldstein," I promised
myself. He was to play It that night.
But Master Hofmann. turning a
whimsical eye over his shoulder at me,
began to playâ la laâ la, laâ what was
it? â a cheap, swaying, three-four
rhythm.
" 'Fishing:,' " he explained solemnly.
"I heard it at Fischer's the other night.
Very pretty? Miss what Is her
name?**
"Morton â "
"Sings very w*Hâ " la, laâ la, laâ.
And It turned out that Mr. Hofmann
had not been deterred by "Miss Mazu
xna" from taking in also "Down the
Line."
Automobiling seemed nearer after
that than Beethoven and I asked the
pianist which he preferred, playing
piano or inventing autos, which is his
preferred amusement.
"It Is easier to play the piano," he
laughed, settling back into a big chair,
with something the air oi Eugene con
fronting Mcrell in the second act of
"Candida."
Then he told me that he had invented
two machines. One is a gasoline affair,
the other an electric motor car. A man
had lust been with him 'to talk over
putting them on the market. He, him
self, had not before considered the
business side of his inventions. Pleas
ure â well, he had traveled up hill and
down dale for 2000 miles in his machine
this summer and never touched the
railrcad. Was not that true fun â rac
ing, sealing hills, rocking along the
level among the loveliest of scenery?
Alone? Yes. without a chauffeur â that
is. h^ looked after the machine himself.
His friend. Corstar.tine Sternberg;. the
Philadelrhian, composer and pianist,
had traveled with him. Did they camp
by the way? No. They took only
chocolate and cognac with them, de
pending upon the hotels for the rest.
The latter was necessary from the rad
ical changes of climate.
"How delightful to be able to go
where you please, stop when you
please, start when you please â "

One of the most brilliant society
events of this season occurred in
Stockton a few days ago, when Mrs.
W. H. Clary gave a tea to Mrs- Charl

so dear to the feminine heart, and of

Miss Clary met Mr. Barette and the
mutual attraction was so earnest that
without informing their families they
married very early in the acquaintance.

On Tuesday a clever conception of

Now, "fancy" scarce covers the ground
since many of the costumes were
not exactly in that class. But there
was funâ loads of it.
The affair was announced as a hobo
rxcursion to the fair.
M hat a tame week! The fair seems
to bÂ» a contributory cause. But there
appears to be a growing tendency in
the fmart ret to gather in small groups
vhere each soul is likened unto tho
other, and who seeks its pleasures thus
untrammeled. But when it becomes
necessary in the course of social events
to give an "affair-'-as every woman
occasionally must, if she hopes to re
tain prestigeâ then the "nice" people
of their acquaintance are bidden.
But, seriously, something must be
done In society toward cultivating the
art of interesting speech, reasonably
clean of vulgarisms and commonplace
slang, for there is nothing so contrib
utive to the charm of maid or matron
as well-chosen, well-enunciated and
well-intentioned speech.
"Fewer Jewels at your throat and
more from your, lips" aptly tells the
whole tale. But the "tea" won't help
youâ for ere you have the ear of a con
genial friend and are mutually inter
ested in a clever chatâ and it need not
be encyclopedic nor pedantic to be
cleverâ in bounds some effusive and
ebullient maid into your corner, and
that chat dies a-borning.
Ar.d it is a dispensation devoutly to
be hoped for that the "tea" mania will
have spent its force ere it strikes this
burg, and that the short musicale â or
Bomethin?r equally sane â be substituted.
And therein may the lost art of con
versation ba revivified. It is not unin
terening to note that in Gotham, Bos
ton. Philadelphia, and even in Chicago â
which has never been accused of deep
seated social cultureâ the "tea" has
been voted as worthy only of their bu
colic .suburbs.
And for it. family medicosâ those of
them who are on a yearly stipend
â are already prescribing a three
weeks' rest cure, to be taken
before and after. And small won
der! for witness the "tea" epidemic
of last winter, with its eighteen
debutantes and its bunches of brides.
For each was there a "tea," and by
every friend of each to the other, until
It became a regular thing for bevies of
maids to charge upon a half-dozen
"teas" in one afternoon â and to repeat
the same vocal inanities at each. Why,
the only wonder is that they didn't be
come "driveling Â«*jits"' ere the merciful
fall of the Lenten curtain. But they
didn'tâ that is, most of them survived
the attack more or less successfully.
But there were tonics to be paid for,
and massage and doctors' bills, not to
mention the financial wear and tear on
"popper" for the giddy raiment in
which the '"tea"-p:oing maid galloped
to her doom.
The "tea" madness is almost upon us.

j ' George Jr. continues that on March
I 4. IS 97, he married Violet Henry and
â¢ since that time Anna Monnier has
shown hatred and bitterness toward
1 the young man's wife. Shortly after
the marriage the senior Mrs. Monnier
i attempted, and she continues to at
! tempt, it is said, to separate the con
j testant and his wife and prior to the
j rfaking of the will she threatened that
iC they did not separate she would
cause the elder Monnier to disinherit
i George Jr.
A week after the marriage, it is
alleged, she importuned the contestant
J to leave his wife and by reason or her
j persuasions he remained away from
j his wife for two weeks, but returned
\ later and then accompanied the elder
I woman to Europe, leaving his wife

jctmber 18, 1897, the young wife gave
I birth to a child and Monnier charges
that Anna Monnier caused to be pub

"I beg to inform my beloved .mem
bers of the mother church that the
by-law in article XXVI of its man
ual does not require members of
benevolent and progressive organiza
tions, such as the Free Masons, Odd
Fellows, temperance societies and
those of similar cult, to resign this
membership. It specifies in plain Eng
lish that after individuals become
members of our church they shall not
thereafter 'be made' members of clubs
or other organizations not named in
its manual, and wherefore? Because
oui religious denomination demands
the faithful attention and labor of its
members in all philanthropic, ther
apeutic and progressive Christian work
for the human race, and relies upon
the adequate, scientific source and re
source therefor."
Dear Sir: â Referring to the article
published in this morning's issue of
your paper, in case there might be a
mistaken impression regarding same, I
should like you to publish the follow
ing:
The Christian Science by-law refer
ring to members of the Christian Sci
ence Church, belonging to clubs or or
ganizations to which both sexes are
not eligible, was promulgated last
May. As published by you, the by
law indicates on its face that it is
not retroactive, but applies to mem
bers" of the mother church who may
Join thereafter. It applies to the
branch churches in the same way.
Hence, there were no "orders" or
"commands" given, which would ap
ply to members of clubs or organiza
tions who were Christian Science
members at that time.
It is true that throughout the coun
try many Christian Science members,
both ladies and gentlemen, prominent
in clubs and organizations, have seen
fit to resign their memberships, be
lieving that what applied to. future
Christian Science members could, with
good reason, be applicable to present
members. These resignations, how
ever, were entirely voluntary on their
part, and under no "orders" or "com
mands." Such action on their part
was, possibly, because they believed
they could best subserve their interests
and that of their families and their
own consciences, and such action was
purely a matter of their own decision,
without interference, commands or or
ders from any one.
Shortly after the adoption of the by
law referred to, Mrs. Eddy issued a
card, published in the Christian Sci*
ence Journal of June, 1904, reading
as follows:
"Take Notice.
"Mary B. G. Eddy.

Resolved to stop the practice of
kissing, a dozen pretty Lexington, Ga.,
girls, who decided that it was a silly
custom, have organized an antl-klssing
club and adopted a rigorous constitu
tion, some of the clauses of which are:
The object of this club is to promote
hygiene, candor, saneness and finance
among members.
Each member shall sign the following
pledge with her own blood, secured
from her lips:
"I pledge myself to never kiss any
one except father, mother, brothers,
sisters, husband and children.
"I pledge myself furthermore to never
kiss my betrothed until I have become
his wife. " .':_.'. '-\
"If I fail to keep this pledge I will
pay a fine of $25 and ask the club to
erase my name from the roll."
On the marriage of any member of
this club, each member shall pay $5 to
the treasurer,' who shall present the
amount as a bridal gift to the bride.
The amount paid in by those who fail
to keep the pledge shall be held by the
treasurer as a fund to be .divided
among those who prefer spinsterhood.
Any member who applies for divorce
shall pay to the treasurer. $50 and have
sÂ»er name removed from the roll. .

is the only living Indian so far as
known who was with the original Six
Nations in New York State. The Win

old Iroquois, and in their unhappy
peregrinations, ending at the Nebraska
reservation. Mother Smlles-at-Woe has
remained with them. She has shunned

MAKING TEA.
NOW that the British "mission" hasVoncluded its business with
the titular head of the Government of Tibet and turned to
breast the passes back into India before the snows come down,
statesmen in far-away England are gravely seeking to discover
whether or not the game has been worth the candle. True, the
armed commercial envoys have exacted Tibetan agreement to the
letter of a treaty which gives England trade precedence in that
bleak country over all comers, notably Russia; true also that with
characteristic frugality the leaders of the invasion have wrested
from the Tibetans indemnity enough to cover the cost of the long
transmontane march ; but what are some of the by-products of the
affair so expeditiously consummated?
The Dalai Lama, whatever may be his personal unfitness for the
station, occupies toward the Buddhistic world a position nearly com
parable to that of the great medieval popes in Christendom. To
tens of thousands of Great Britain's subjects in India the name of
this great high priest of Buddha is hedged about with a sanctity that
embodies all the intense mysticism of the Oriental mind. By their
armed entrance inio the Forbidden City, against the desire rf the
Dalai Lama and to the detriment of his peace of mind, the Young
husband rxpedilirn trenched upon that sacred being's prerogatives
to a degree that must seem nothing short of impious to the stern
religionists of the great sect.
In China, on the other hand, the followers of Buddha divide with
the Shintoists the religious convictions of countless hordes of people.
The Chinese Buddhists will take to heart the violation of their high
priest's dignity no less keenly than the Indians. England has grow
ing interests in the yellow empire of far weightier import than the
petty question of trade with an ice-bound principality on the roof
of the world. How the recent high-handed treatment of sacred
personages in this Mecca of the Buddhists is going to react on
England's sphere of influence there, as well as upon her subjects in
India, is a matter for present conjecture. Some London papers voice
the .sentiment that the fiddler has yet to be paid for the little military
dance up among the clouds of Thibet.

DRESSMAKERS as well as mil
liners are finding that the possi
bilities of chiffon are almost In
exhaustible and the newest and
perhaps most novel use of this
lovely and perishable material is
In the making of chiffon flowers.
There Is an airiness and delicacy about
these chiffon roses and other flowers
that quite surpass any other artificial
flowers and makes them exceedingly
attractive for trimming hats and ball
gowns. At present they are being used
wherever possible on women's gowns,
and their popularity is proven by the
fact that many wedding gowns turned
out by noted costumers are decorated
in some way with these dainty hand
made posies.
Almost any of the flowers â roses, dah
lias, snowdrops, fuchsias, sweet peas or
geraniums â mar be made of chiffon,
and good results may be achieved by
the ordinary girl who is possessed of
patience, clever flngero and deftness
with the needle. In making thesfe flow
ers there is not only the delight of be
ing able to fashion dainty things, but
a real saving in personal expenditure.
Roses are perhaps the most popular
and about the easiest to make. For
these, parts of old w rs, stems, leaves
and calyxes may be used, but if not at
hand all that is needed is a spool of
green mounting wire and some of the
green calyxes that can be purchased
for a few cents in the shops. To make
a bunch of four roses will require
three-quarters of a yard of chiffon of
any preferred color, white, pink, red or
yellow. In beginning the rose fold the
chiffon width so that it is three-quar
ters long by four inches wide. Measure
along the selvedges five inches and cut
straight through the width; repeat this
three times. Take one of the five-inch
pieces, fold, cut edge to edge, and run
a thread through both of them to hold
them together. Be sure and let the
material be slightly eased on the thread
before manipulating it into form.
Now take one end at the cut edges
Sweet peas are easily made, as only
two petals are required, one like the
geranium petal and a square puff in
front of it. The variegated effect of
these pretty flowers can be obtained
by using chiffons in two colors, one
over the other, as, for instance, the
wing could be made of pink over
white, the lobe, or lower one, of white
over pink, and so on. In bunches
these chiffon sweet peas are very love
ly and pay for the time and trouble
expended in making them.
In fuchsias the petals forming the
cup are made on the same lines as
those of the geranium, except that it
is necessary they should overlap each
other. Be sure to get the long, nar
row effect peculiar to those blossoms.
Sometimes this difficulty is met by
making petals of velvet. The green
part that comes next before the green
calyx may also be of velvet. The
petals are gummed on between outer
rows of petals and calyx. Threads of
colored silk with knots at the end
should be put through the center to
finish the flower. They should be left
at unequal lengths.
Dahlias, forget-me-nots, violets and
other flowers having small petals are
easily made if one only follows the
lines laid down in the making of pa
per flowers, there being only one gold
en rule to observe â get as near to the
real form and coloring as possible.
and slowly roll up the length with
the thumb and first finger of the right
hand until the heart is formed. Do
this rather tightly at first, then more
and more loosely near the finish, tak
ing care to keep the folds even at the
top. Now bring the folds of chiffon
together at the bottom, and, taking
the rose In the left hand, twist a piece
of mounting wire over the chiffon, just
above the line of stitches, and very
tightly draw it down to the last tiny
raw edge of chiffon. Crook a piece of
mounting wire, or the wire with a
piece of tubing, if you have it; secure
the base of the rose on top of the
crook firmly, and slip over the stem
a green calyx. Now take a 4 iece of
green chiffon about half an inch wide,
place one "end close to the calyx and
wind the stem evenly and secure with
a thread and needle to prevent un
raveling. You will then have the fin
ished rose.

AS the date of the Presidential election draws near, the issues
before the country tend to become more definite and precise
as fundamental principles and policies emerge from the mere
verbiage of attack and recrimination. The true and responsible
voice of the country has now made itself unmistakably heard in its
demand for a continuity of the policy which has already placed
America in the forefront of the world's progress. The supreme re
quisite of the moment is not for the political patent medicines nor
for the party sleight of hand by which the Democrats have so un
successfully sought to impose upon the sagacity of the nation, but
rather for a guarantee of continuity, and for the assurance that
there will be no meddling with the fiscal system which has been
proved to lie at the very roots of the national prosperity.
Continuity and consistency are as essential to business enter
prise as is a firm foundation for a building. â¢ Nothing is so justifiably
apprehensive of change and shock as the vast commercial edifice of
a nation ; nothing is so easily and immediately discouraged, confused
and checked. That the country does not anticipate a disturbance,
which would be nothing short of a national calamity, is sufficiently
shown by trade reports, and by all those other indices which most
actually demonstrate the existing business situation.
The New York State Department of Labor, which has a pecul
iarly representative character, shows, for example, an unusual activ
ity in ever}' department which it covers. So far from there being
a depression in business circles there is a very unusual activity, and
this is peculiarly significant coming as it does after a period of
phenomenally good times when some reaction might reasonably be
expected. If there were any general doubt as to the electoral results
we should see an inevitable nervous reticence on the part of capital
and enterprise, which would react disastrously upon the labor mar
ket. That there is no such doubt is proved by a general activity
and confidence, and by the fact that an unpreccdentedly small num
ber of men are out of work. Such a showing would be impossible if
there were any anticipation of a change.
The claims of the Democratic party to be intrusted with the
government of the country would perhaps carry greater weight if
it first showed some capacitj- for governing itself, some power of
unselfish cohesion in support of a basic principle, some faculty for
subordination and controlling the self-seeking elements of its own
ranks. The necessity of self-mastery applies even more forcibly to
a political party than to the individual, but the only unity which the
Democratic party has so far displayed is in menace, criticism and
destruction. Its only unanimity is in unscrupulous and personal
attack, in its efforts to place the country in the worst possible light ;
to array class against class and interest against interest ; to mag
nify discord wherever it is to be found and to create it where it
does not now exist. A party banner which has become a mere
rallying point and meeting ground for all the disrupting forces of
greed and discontent is not one to commend itself to a commercial
people, nor is it likely to win the sympathy of those who ask nothing
more of the Government than that simple stability of policy and of
intention which will enable them to forecast the future with reason
able confidence. This is of course the very breath of life to every
business community.
Of responsible and constructive policy the Democratic party
appears to have no trace whatever, and it could perhaps meet with
no worse fate than to be called upon to face its own discords and
to reconcile its own internal, conflicting and mutually destructive
policies. Its advocates have no more alluring prospect to offer
than a long and ruinous term of tariff meddling, which would par
alyze commercial activity, shatter every trade relation, whether do
mestic or foreign, and supplant the general confidence which now
prevails by widespread and well-grounded apprehension and dis
trust. We have seen the extent to which a political campaign may
be carried on by mere stone-throwing, but we are not likely to be
persuaded that a country can be governed by the same means.
The Republican party â the party of deed and accomplishment â
needs to-day no special pleading and no defense other than that
which is triumphantly afforded by every index of prosperity and by
the dominant position which the country incontestably occupies in
the councils of the world. It has no warring factions to be fed and ap
peased: no personal or sectional interests which must be gratified
at the expense of the country's well being. It presents a united pol
icy of enlightened patriotism of which the future is guaranteed by
the past..

them into peaceable and industrious
peoples, if it has abolished the curse of
slavery left by the old corrupt civiliza
tion of paganism, and has given to us
the accumulated wisdom of past ages
which but for it would have been de
stroyed, ma*y we not conclude that its
mission is divine and that its laws fur
nish a safe rule of human conduct?
Its wisdom inspired the establishment
of the great universities and schools
with which the civilized world is filled
to-day. It has done more to promote
the arts and sciences than all the civil
institutions In the world.
Furthermore, marriage, an integral
component of the religious system, is
not only the normal source of increas
ing the members in our population,
but it determines essentially the char
acter and quality of the members of
society. Its legitimate fruits, there
fore, are not produced unless it is a
relation as enduring as the lives of
the narties who enter it. To lessen Its
bond means to impair the lives and
fortunes of its people more exten
sively in the long un than the worst
epidemics of disease ever known.
Next to the marriage relation itself
the ties of consanguinity are the most
useful and strengthening cords by
which society is held together. They
are the greatest safeguards of that
mutual co-operation by which prop
erty is Justly distributed. Industry is
promoted under the strongest incen
tives in the efforts of parents to pro
vide for their children, and the safest
insurance of a competence In old age
is secured by having a large family
of dutiful children. For the poorer
classes early and prolific marriages
are the greatest boon; they sweeten
toil by causing it to yield its most
beneficent fruits. The numerous
beneficiary societies which flourish to
day are only an artificial substitute
for the mutual help which marriage
and consanguinity naturally and much
more efficaciously provide.
Would that this beneficent author
ity had never been set aside, for then
the civil power would never have lost
the respect of the people, nor would
so many wars have been fomented to
blight the earth with desolation and
death. Nor, again, would multitudes
have become so demoralized by dis
obedience to law and idleness that In
these days of plenty the land is filled
with homeless vagabonds not willing
to labor and not ashamed to beg. Pov
erty then would not be associated, aa
it often is. with our boasted progress,
which, if it be a blessing, should make
the conditions of all men more happy
and prosperous.

'Here it is. Th' first thing that shud
be done f'r a child is to deprive it iv

as lumbago, pain in th' chist, pre

which are privalent among adults,
can be communicated to a child fr'm
th' parent. Besides it is bad f'r th'
moral nature iv th' infant. Affection
f'r its parents is wan iv th' mos' dan
gerous symptoms iv rickets. Th' par-
cordance with the richest possiblitles
of human development.
Philosophy and history teach us that
a social bond like that of the family
has for its object not only the material
welfare of the members of it, but also
their moral improvement; and it fur
thermore establishes order in the vari
ous acts of men. Hence we conclude
that religion is necessary for man's
social well-being because it is the
foundation of his moral conviction and
conduct upon which the stability of
human society depends.
If the ideas of moral responsibility
and obligation which religion has in
culcated in the minds and conscience
of men were wholly obliterated society
could not be held together. The author
of nature must therefore also be the
author of society and religion, and the
great social problem of this age, as it
has been of every other, must be to es
tablish harmony between them.
If the theories of such men as Pro
fessor Haeckel, author of "The Riddle
of the Universe," and of our own Pro
fessor Edgar L. Larkin, were univers
ally accepted, universities and observ
atories could not exist.
If religion has been able, through the
Gospel, to carry civilization to the most
degraded savages, and has transformed
in physics. The many phases of elec
trical energy were shown to intensely
lnterested audiences in forty-four lec
tures. Chemistry, metallurgy and do
mestic science were each treated six
times. Textile fabrics, mining, pho
tography, lithography, the making of
a newspaper, the building of a ship
and navigation claimed twenty lec
tures. A large number of discourses
were given on history, ancient, modern
and American. More than sixty were
delivered on sociology, twenty-two on
education and 134 on literature.
Devotees of music and art were re
galed respectively by eighty-five and
sixty- five lectures. In this great
work of blending instruction and
entertainment the topic which ap
pealed moat powerfully to the
large number without specialized
tastes or definite cultural aims
was descriptive geography. Fully 250
lectures were given by men and
women travelers illustrative of their
travels in North. Central and South
America, Europe, Asia and Africa.
For this purpose the stereopticon was
an invariable and invaluable assist
ant All scientific lectures are abund
antly illustrated by experiments.
One of the immediate effects of
these addresses is the great stimulus
to calls for books bearing upon the
various subjects presented. To meet
this demand the public library and its
numerous branches provide a large
number of books, which are loaned
at the close of the meeting. At the
end of a certain electrical talk 200
copies of a standard electrical work
were loaned or sold at cost.
Who are f the attendants at these
places of Instruction? Young men
problem. Some of the old school
houses have auditoriums, though usu
ally they are located at the top of
the building. The new schoolhouses
are all provided with assembly halls,
generally being placed on the ground
floor. Churches are glad to give the
ura of. their halls and chapels to fur
ther such educational efforts.
Better evidence of the value of
these lectures to uplift and Inspire their
attendants can hardly be given than
by culling a few extracts from thou
sands of letters received by Dr. Leip
ziger: "The lectures are a boon to
us mothers. They keep us in touch
with our sons and daughters at high
school."
"I work hard all day and the look
ing forward to this entertainment
once or more times a week proves a
sweetener of labor."
A teacher writes: "I do not think I
can show my appreciation more fully
than by the' fact that in spite of being
tired out when Friday night comes,
and notwithstanding other engage
ments, I simply could not .'stay away
from one of the lectures. My only re
gret is that they end so soon."
"I am a busy housewife and the
lectures have created for me a dif
ferent atmosphere and have afforded
about the only amusement that has
come into my life. The knowledge
there received so freely has broadened
my range of thought and enables me
to answer more fully the many ques
tions of my children."
"I haven't had any education to speak
of exceDt that which I manage to pick
up here and there. I am 31 years 'old,
and appreciate now very much any
form' in which I gather it. I am trying
predominate when electricity, pho
tography or other practical topics are
discussed; women when historical
or literary subjects are' presented;
matrons when the care of dhildren is
taught; all classes are present when
the lecturer appeals to the human ele
ment of sympathy in life and its thrill
ing experiences.
Who are the lecturers? Largely
professors and teachers but also in
cluding professional men, journalists,
inventors and travelers. Those who
possess specialized knowledge, who
have the ability to clearly present it
to others and who also have the deli
cate charm of sympathetic touch with
subject and audience. None others
are invited to speak twice.
One lecturer delivered his address
in French; fourteen others gave theirs
in Yiddish, and sixteen more spoke in
Italian. The fees paid the lecturers
are moderate. Probably $10 Is the
average sum.

requires consummate wisdom and
tact. In Dr. Henry M. Leipziger. su

since assuming care of the system in
1890 has made the -vork an unquali

lecture occasion. Ordinarily the lec

ON the authority of the
French papers, a new
science of "scarpol
ogy" has been invented
by Dr. Garre of Basel,
a Swiss scientist. The
name is' taken from the Italian word
for an old shoe, scarpaccis, the di
minutive of ecarpa. He claims for it
edge and those that were worn down
at the heel. By arguing from the
known to the unknown, by comparing:,
deducing and contrasting, he was at
last able to lay down the broad line of
the science. He passed long hours
among his old boots, amplifying and
extending the rules he had discovered,
inventing fresh ones and accounting
for contradictious.
more frequent that the sole on one
side is worn like a wafer, while on the
other side it is of normal thickness,
and the heel is sliced on to a wedge.
A person having bow legs .will nat
urally walk on the outside edge of
the shoe. Such persons, says the
learned doctor, ; "are obstinate and
headstrong. They are ambitious and
take;up any scheme, where they think
there is profit. In fact if the soles
and heels are worn along their en
tire length the wearer is, no doubt, an
adventurer. This \ is hard on sailors,
who are often bow' legged. The wom
en who tread on the outside of the
tfshoe have the same general character
in a less pronounced . form.
Dr. Garre first began his study of
hoots .by collecting ," a pair from each
stirred by passion. If the shoe belongs
to a woman and is thus evenly, worn
the wearer was chaste, unexpressive,
of simple tastes and a constant mind:
one who is content never to wander
from her own fireside. So far the sci
ence has taught nothing that an ordi
narily observant person could not
have found out for. himself without ex
amining footgear. However, it is far
relative, male and female. To this
collection he -added well worn shoes
belonging to various prominent person
ages. In most cases some character
istic of the owner was known to him
and ticketed upon the shoes. When
the shelves were full the doctor set to
work to classify his acquisitions. He
sorted out those that /were worn even

chiromancy. Broadly stated, the fun
damental principles of the art are as
follows: If the soles and heels are
worn evenly and there is no undue
tendency to thinness in any part Dr.
Garre is able to assert that the wearer
was a steady, respectable, methodical
business man of regular habits, a man
of even temper, seldom or never
STUDY OF OLD SHOES RESULTS IN NEW SCIENCE KNOWN AS SCARPOLOGY
Women decide to adopt the report of
their committee and to endeavor to
secure the establishment of popular
Itcture courses in this city the ques
tion arises whether such a project can
be made successful. Possibly It will
be contended In opposition that such
a system will be costly, that climatio
features indispose the people from
seeking such methods of recreation and
enlightenment and, finally, that there
are but few suitable places which are
available for lecture audiences of this
type.
This last objection is at present &
valid one. but it will be recalled there
is an old adage that "Where there - a
will there is a way." Instant success
must not .be expected, but difficulties
melt away before determined persons
and this hindrance can certainly be
overcome. The same obstacles have
been encountered in New York and
have been surmounted. It is a fortu
nate thing for San Francisco that dis
cussion of such an innovation comes
up before the adoption of the plans
for the new school buildings.
In the light of the long experience of
Dr. Lelpziger in this field his recent
words are emphatic: "No problem to
day is more important than that of the
continuous education of the great body
of men and women who must earn their
livelihood. All these need to have their
drudgery beautified, thetr routine dig
nified, and taught to believe that noth
ing is menial or low. and this can be
done only by idealizing service through
knowledge, and thus it may be hoped
that the schoolhouae of the future may
become not only the piace of instruc
tion for children, but a place of intel
ligent resort for tnen and women."
at this age to overcome as much as I
can my colossal ignorance, and I have
attended all the lectures I could find
time for in the last three months."
"I have Joined a library since hear
ing these lectures and have read up the
subjects well. A man who elevates his
fellow men to a higher plane is, indeed,
a benefactor of men, and such a man
is he who instituted these lectures for
the people."
"My mother and I attended the lec
ture on 'The Ministry of Birds,' which
was very good, like all others, and since
then we have a wooden box on our fire
escape, always containing crumbs for
the birds and a glass of water."
"The benefit I derive from the lec
tures thousands of others who have no
other opportunity derive also. To work
all day, and at night when all tired
out to sit down at a book and study
is no easy thing, but to hear a lecture
from which you gain twice as much as
you would from the book, to say noth
ing of Its interest, is something many
take advantage of. and thus many

"I have attended the lectures given

ten years, and feel as if I had taken a
college course, I have learned so much.
It has created in me a desire for read

WHY should not the
city of San Fran
cisco establish free
courses of popular
lectures as a part
of its educational
system? This is the question now asked
by the local council of women of San
Francieco. Their committee appointed
last year in a late report have taken
strong ground that such a work should
be begun and maintained for the edu
cation of the adult population of this
city.
As a distinct educational influence
free lectures have long since passed
the experimental stage in New York,
Boston, Chicago and other cities. These
courses of lectures are an outgrowth of
a prevalent belief that our common
schools in cities are accomplishing but
part of their legitimate work. Instead
of being supported for the education of
children exclusively It is held that they
should aid in the education of the en
tire community- Stern necessity com
pels an early entrance by a large ma
jority of children into a life of toll.
Thereafter favoring opportunities to
gain in knowledge are few. except
through the public library. Boys and
pirls enter manhood and womanhood
and those only who are readers make
intellectual progress. Kow shall the
host of non-readers be reached? In
v hat way shall the increasing leisure
of the laboring classes be used for their
best advantage? "We are great cow
ards," says an educational leader, "if
we believe that the masses of the peo
ple kept in health by a wholesome
amount of daily toil, and once more
erect with eelf-respect, are going to
squander a leisure to which they bring
good health and high spirits and a so
cial heart." The adoption of a sys
trm of free lectures to the people fur
nishes a partial answer to these ques
tions.
Referring to the city of New York
alone for information concerning what
has been accomplished by free lectures
it may be noted that they have been
given in that city with increasing suc
cess for fifteen years. Beginning in
1889 with 1S6 lectures to audiences, num
bering in the aggregate 22.000 persons,
they have expanded in 1904 to 4665 lec
tures, given by 453 speakers in 143 dif
ferent places or lecture centers. The
total attendance has risen to the enor
mous figure of 1,134,000 persons.
The definite purpose of these lectures
is to stimulate study; to co-operate
with public libraries and museums; to
encourage discussion; to bring the best
methods of the best teachers to bear
upon the great problem of the diffu
sion of culture among all the citizens
of a great citV.
The themes developing the strong
est interest have been, first, facts
concerning the body and its care; then
natural science and its wonders; how
steam has been harnessed; how elec
tricity is made to serve mankind; how
the stars move in their courses. Every
country on the globe has been de
scribed by travelers. Speaking more
in detail, no less than eighteen courses
of lectures were given on "First Aid
to the Injured," besides others on
health topics. The engrossing subject
of nature study received the rapt at
tention of these city dwellers in thir
ty lectures. Sixteen were given in as
tronomy, sixteen in biology and forty

the birth rate, which has gradually led
to great disasters. The decline of an
cient Israel dates from the close of the
reign of "Solomon in all his glory." The
splendor of the age of Pericles was
short-lived, and the Augustan age was
too brief for mankind to retain and
perpetuate its benefits. Society to-day
is as surely verging toward a collapse
even more dreadful than it has ever
suffered in the past unless there be a
universal reversion to the principles
and conduct enjoined upon mankind by
the law of nature. Even should a civ
ilized people respect nature's laws and
faithfully preserve the fecundity at
which nature alms, this, however, it is
universally conceded, is not enough for
the welfare of society. Mere physical
birth is not the birth of the whole man,
an intelligent creature endowed with
free will. His destiny is to work out in
himself his likeness to God until he is
united with the divine perfection, be
coming a "partaker of the nature of
God." God, says Holy Scripture, "made
the nations of the earth for health, and
there is no poison of destruction In
them, nor kingdom of hell upon the
earth." (Wisdom. i:14.)
Consequently we must include in our
calculations a system directing and
conserving the sources of society in ac-
THE problem of a great
city's water supply is two
fold. Unless nature has
been bountiful in her pro-
vision the energy of the
aqueduct builder is powerless to meet
the demand. Unless the system of mains
and conduits is thorough and generous
and diligently preserved in its efficiency,
nature's bounty is In vain.
In estimating the strength of the
modern social fabric we must firEt of all
look at the fecundity of our race. The
birth rate is the prime factor in social
development. Although each genera
tion passes away so quickly that society
as a. whole seems to be little affected
by it, yet the whole fabric rests upon
that primitive and natural union of the
Fexes by which offspring is generated
and reared. Consequently the more uni
versal and normal marriage is, the
stronger and purer society becomes. A
nation which depends chiefly upon im
migration for its increase of population
is as really becoming extinct as if It
were being exterminated by an invad
ing army.
Great as are the benefits which civ
ilization has conferred upon mankind,
its history nevertheless shows that ita
progress has repeatedly been marred by
a moral degeneracy directly affecting

H. O. Havemeyer of New York, It Is
asserted, possesses the most costly col
lection of violins in the world,
Judge Troutt on Friday heard the di
rectors of a corporation ask legal sanc
tion to the violation of a by-law under
the plea that "they needed the
money."
The holders of over 450,000 shares
of the stock of the Pacific Jupiter Steel
Company â all but the holders of
eleven shares â passed a by-law provid
ing that no assessment should be
levied until the treasury stock was
sold. A year and a half later an as
sessment was levied though 250,000
shares of treasury stock remained un
sold. It was paid under protest. Now
the directors have levied another assess
ment, and stockholdersâ among them
many newspaper menâ who bought un
der the by-law against assesment have
applied to the Superior Court for an
Injunction restraining its collection.
The directors of the company plead
that the by-law was never adopted, or
if it was adopted it Is invalid, and that
they need the money to pay debts,
though the "corporation has a plant
valued at $140,000. They admit that
the treasury stock has not been sold
and say it cannot be sold, as "It is not
worth a cent a bushel."
In a similar action commenced by
other stockholders Judge Murasky
held that the by-law was adopted, that
it was valid and binding and that an
injunction should be issued.
Judge Troutt has taken the matter
under advisement and will decide some
time next week whether directors of
a corporation can violate its by-laws
and assess stockholders who bought
stock under the representation that
there could be no assessment, merely
upon the plea that "they need the
money."

The motion was argued before Judge

One of the grounds is that three of

month the mortgages placed on city
properties amounted to 52,273,523, while

ity is not confined to any one section,
but buyers for business property in all
sections of the city are numerous. "The
continued activity in the outside lands
and homestead sections," says the Cir
cular, "Indicates that the buyer of
small means who is looking for a home
site is in the market, while the fact
that the monthly figures continue to
exceed $3,000,000, with no more than the
usual number of large sales, indicates
that the general market for property is
steady and strong."
The Starr estate has sold to a client
of Guy T. Wayman 50x100 feet on the
southeast line of Market street, 225 feet
northeast of Fourth, with three-story
brick building renting for $14,400 a year.
The price is $297,500. This is at the rate
of about $6000 a front foot for inside
property of less than the full depth, as
the lot does not run through to Steven

of all the doctor said. Made her lungs
heal End grow strong and put the flesh
back on her wasted body. Ordinarily
medical treatment seldom, if ever, cures
cancer. The surgeons may cut it away
again and ngain, but it comes back every
time, and brings death with it. But I
cure it, and I do not have to resort to
the butchery of the knife, either. I do
not have to cut flesh and scrape bones.
My treatment is easy, gentle, and gives
no pain, but the disease disappears. One
of my patients, Mrs. M. W. Nolen of
Covington. Ga.. was having her life eaten
away by a cancer. She saw nothing but
a terrible death before her when I took
her case. But I cured her. entirely and
permanently. Paralysis is another sup-
posedly incurable disease. A Mr. R. A.
Wallen of Finey. Mo., had been paralyzed
for over four years and nothing the doc-
tors could do gave him any relief. That
did not discourage me. I took the case
in the face of their verdict, and to-day
the man is walking ardund as well as
you or I. So it was with Mrs. L. A.
Phillips of Trawick. Tex. She had been
bedridden for five years; in 12 different
hospitals and under the treatment of va-
rious doctors who all failed to cure her
of the complication of diseases from
which she was suffering, including kid-
ney trouble, catarrh of the bladder,
gravel, female weakness, ulcers, chronic
indigestion and extreme . nervousness.
The medicine that doctors gave her did
her no good. But my treatment did. I
cured her, and she says I raised her from
the dead. These are only random cases
from the many hundreds I have cured,
and I mention them merely to show you
that it is a mistake to say that any dis-
ease is incurable. They may have been
incurable before I made my discovery,
but they are so no longer."
"But how do you make these marvel-
ous cures? What is this power that you
possers?" asked the visitor.
"It would take too long to tell you,
but here is a copy of a book I have writ-
ten describing my discovery and my
method of treatment. I do not sell it. I
had it printed for distribution among my
friends and patients and those who
might be interested in this study of a
new science. To them I am glad to give
it upon request. If reading the book
does not satisfy you and you want to
know more of how I cure any disease,
tell some one who Is sick to write to me.
I will go even further â tell any one who
is attacked by any disease, no matter
what It is. to write to me, telling me the
name of their trouble or their principal
symptoms, age and sex, addressing Prof.
Thomas F. Adkin, Office 546A, Rochester,
N. Y.. and I will prove my power to do
all that I claim, and I will give the
proof, without charging a cent for my
services."
"Do you mean that any one can accept
this offer?"
"I mean it for any one who is ill, from
any cause, and who feels that the doc-
tors do not understand the case, or who
does not want to pay doctors' or drug-
gists" bills."
"But how about those at a distance,
can you cure them, too?"
"Just as easily and Just as surely as
though they came to my office, whether
they live one or a thousand miles away,
it's all the same. A letter to me does
just as much good as a personal visit."
"And do they not have to inclose any
money?"
"Not a single cent. Simply write to
me and ask to be cured."
TherÂ» is considerable mystery attached
to his method of accomplishing these
marvels, as it 13 known that he does not
â¢use drastic drugs and medicines that
doctors depend upon. He claims to have
discovered that a certain law of nature
has peculiar properties heretofore unsus-
pected, and that by the application of
this law there is no disease he may not
cure. And It is a matter of proof that
with the mysterious power this discov-
ery gives him he has made the blind see
and the lame walk. He has revived the
flickering spark of fire in bodies on the
very verpe of the prave, and restored to
health men and women given up to die
by doctors and ppecialists. He seems to
have absolute control over human life
and the diseases that attack it.
Notwithstanding what might be con-
sidered a most favorable opportunity, he
does not extort money from those whom
he treats, saying: "Carnegie chooses to
give libraries. I prefer to give life and
health. I am not a millionaire, but I am
well able to afford to grlve my services
free to the sick and afflicted. My dis-
covery is my own, to do with as I please,
and I cnuld charge every patient a thou-
sand dollars if I wanted to. But I don't.
And 1 know of no law to compel me to
take money for restoring a man to
health. I do not care what the disease
Js. I am just as roady to cure consump-
tion, cancer, paralysis, Bright's disease
or any one of the so-called incurable dis-
eases as I am to cure rheumatism, stom-
ach trouble, catarrh, blood disorders, or
any other ill that flesh is heir to. I am
just as ready and willing to give my ser-
vices free to the poor man as I am to the
rich man. When it comes to a question
of life or death, siciuiess or health, the
amount of money a man has makes no
difference with me. A prince or a pau-
per, I treat them just the same. To me,
as to the law, all persons are equal. I
see and admit of no difference between
patients as far as I am concerned. If I
choose to help all who are ill without
pay. there is nothing to prevent my do-
ing so. I may as well tell you right here
that I mean to keep on curing any one
who asks me of any disease they may
have Just as long as I am willing and
able. What other men do, what they fail
to do, or what they <Â£iarge makes
no difference to me. I feel that it is my
duty to carry out my own plan in my
own way, however much it costs me. I
can not bear to think of men and women
and little children continuing to suffer
and die when I have the power to save
them and restore them to life and health
so easily and quickly, and there is no
disease I may no cure.
"You think that a broad statement?
Well, maybe it is, but no broader than
the truth. I know the wonderful power I
have because I have tested it in thou-
sands of cases. You know consumption
is supposed to be incurable. Well, not
long ago I had a young lady as a patient.
Miss H. L. Kelly of Seal Cove, Me. The
doctors told her that she had consump-
tion and could not live, that her case was
incurable. And to them it was. The poor
girl was in despair, thinking her days
Â¦were numbered. But I cured her in spite

Iowa Jury Eeturns Verdict
in Favor of Californian
Accused by Son-in-Law.
NOT THE CAUSE
OF SEPARATION
Quartermaster General Humphrey in an interview at Washington yes
terday evaded the issue neatly when questioned by an Associated Press rep
resentative. He is quoted as saying: "No complaint has been received at
the War Department of the transport service on the Pacific and no general
investigation has been ordered." Of course not. The charges relate not to
the army- transport service, but to the contracts for transportation of sup
plies in this city and the management of the medicalsupply depot espe
cially to the. matter, of Sraying, where Grover avers there has been bold
and deliberate fraud. v*T
The shifting about of men and transferring of heads of departments to
outside stations has been brought about by orders from headquarters and
further investigation is now or soon will be in progress." It has been ordered
. ; Captain . Cahrles . T. Baker, whose name was mentioned yesterday in con
nection with the transfer of officers from the; quartermaster's depot this
city, for stations in the Philippine Islands, was erroneously, named amonjr
those, that were transferred to the islands as a result of being involved in
the investigations. As a matter of fact. Captain Baker was a member of the
investigating board, and ;it was partly due to* his report that the employes
mentioned were transferred. When seen yesterday Captain Baker said: â¢ â¢
"My position. at the general depot of the -quartermaster's department In
this city is that of assistant depot quartermaster arid as such I have no connec
tion whatever with the transportation branch of. the depot or the transport
service, Â¦ of which Major C. . A. â¢ Devol Is general superintendent arid iri ab
solute charge of every detail relating thereto. ~. ,'Â¦?..'; ..... â¢ ,â¢ ;â¢ â¢
Harry T. Scott, ex-purveyor of the transport service7 who is now with
the Western Warehouse Company, says that he was not called upon to testi
fy at the secret investigation, nor was there any reason why he should have
been, as he was not in the transportation department. He affirms, however,
that the investigation, prior to the one ordered by the War Department, was
conducted by Devol, Stanley and Baker.
Humphrey Evades Point
Why the local transport service officials and those of the quartermas
ter's depot should lend themselves to an effort to cover up the many irregu
larities in the transportation accounts, medical supplies accounts and
other departments under fire, is hard to understand. It is not thought
that any of the new officials have been entangled In the scandal. Major
Devol's effort to minimize the trouble is absurd to any one familiar with
the case. . . .- ." v
Recently F. W. Baker, who audited the drayage accounts, was trans
ferred tp /Philadelphia, but not before he had received a severe reprimand
for allowing the bills to go through unchallenged.
Grover is again to have an audience with the War Department and he
will. submit copies of letters and accounts that he is said to have made
during his term of service here. For some reason the department has
used every endeavor to keep Grover from making a public expose of the
manner . in which the Government has been robbed through - bad manage
ment and worse.
The following is the copy of a letter from Grover giving his experi
ence with the Washington authorities:
â "I did not succeed in seeing President Roosevelt, but I saw Mr. Loeb,
his secretary, who courteously referred me to Secretary Taft. I laid the
case briefly before Mr. Taft and- he listened with attention. He assured me
that he would have the matter thoroughly investigated."
Knox received a reply from the War Department saying that it had
no knowledge of an investigation having taken place at San Francisco
except in the matter of some hay contracts. Major Devol was asked by
the department for an explanation and in reply the major told of his action
in looking up the drayage bills and the medical department accounts. The
War Department reprimanded the major for having- conducted an Inves
tigation without the authority of the quartermaster general and then
placed the matter in the hands of Colonel Patten, the general quartermas
ter for the Pacific Coast, for a second investigation and with authority to
act.
At Washington General Humphrey, quartermaster general, was loth to
delve into the evidence offered, but Secretary of War Taft insisted on hear
ing Grover's story.
The findings of this court were carefully filed awav and, through care
lessness, Washington was not apprised of the holding: of the Investigation.
Clerk A. W. Knox was discharged about this time for intoxication. He
thought that he had not been given a square deal and he filed a protest
with the War Department, which read: "I beg to call your attention to the
methods of conducting the army transport service at San Francisco and to
the strange way the board of Inquiry has handled the testimony." He
then related his own case in detail. - *
Bevol Called to Jlccount. ,
Grovera.few.days ago returned to his post in Indiana. Before leaving he
wrote that he had "evidence that would convince . any . one of the crookedness
that had been extant in the service," adding: *"I will keep firing away at them
as . long as they will accept it."
When Grover made threat to have the whole system of graft that had
caused < so .much trouble exposed, and the War Department- had askea for
an explanation from the 'local. office of the depot quartermaster, there" was
a stir in army â¢â¢ circles. -Major Devol had .been trying, to .clear away the
scandal by making changes in the. various departments. The major un
dertook to form a* court of inquiry on his own authority, ./with- the result
that Captain' Baker, Captain Stanley and himself undertook the. investiga
tion.
The truth in the matter Is that the entire service had been honeycombed
with fraud, criminal carelessness and bad management, and the Chamberlain
and Maus reports only did a part of the work of unraveling the tangle.
The first inquiry regarding the other alleged irregularities was about one
year ago. About six months later T.C. Grover, a clerk in the transportation
department, who is now in the service at Jeff ersonville, ' Ind., was removed to
that post from this city. Â¦ Grover went to Washington" and was well received
by the War Department, Governor Taft being'the man, according to his story,
whom he saw. Grover then reported 'at Jeff ersonville, and later, was granted a
thirty days' leave of absence. He 'came back to Sari Francisco and was here
two weeks ago* and obtained further evidence for the perusal of the War De
partment. Whether this evidence is in the hands of Sacretary Taft or Quarter
master General Humphrey Is not known. â¢
Officials of the army, transport service and the depot quartermaster's de
partment at San Francisco have resorted to the old tactics of trying to sup
press information and to deny statements they know to be correct. The second
scandal involving the depot quartermaster's office in this city had been stu
diously kept from the press until The Call yesterday related the story of the
serious charges brought against the local branch of the quartermaster's ser
vice which have kept Major C. A. Devoland his associates troubled for the last
year.
It became necessary to. Invoke a Congressional inquiry to make the War
Department acknowledge the frauds in the army transport service that were
uncovered during the Chamberlain and Maus Investigation of 1903. Glaring
swindles that were common talk among persons identified with the wholesale
trade of this city were specifically denied: It was even stated that there was
no such thing as a report from Colonel Chamberlain exposing the gross extrav
agance of the service. Congress forced the documents to be presented, and the
public knows what happened..
â¢ Having lately discovered irregularities in the accounts of the transportation
department, the local quartermaster made a number of -changes of heads of
departments, and was probably going to let it go at that. The evidence of
queer transactions was carefully gathered by a special board of inquiry, con
sisting of Major Devol, Captain Stanley and Captain Baker. No direct charges
of fraud were brought against any of the many clerks through whose
hands the accounts for . draying passed, for the investigation was to de
termine how it was possible that bills could have been allowed that were
palpably made up of gross overcharges.

NEW YORK, C t. 8.â For the pur

as to the political outlook of the State
of New York one month before election

respondents throughout the Stata.
Broadly speaking, the State was di

ern tier of counties, beginning at Rock
land and running almost across tha
State.
Another consisted of the counties
around Albany and west out to the Mo

ern section, beginning at Saratoga and
running north to the Canadian line and
west to Jefferson, while still another in
cluded the fifteen counties west, of Os
wego which run In a double tier west
to the Ohio line. Important and repre
sentative counties were selected and bad
spots for both parties were picked out.
The object was to give as nearly as
possible an exact picture of the condi

country which In 1900, roughly, gave
McKlnley 171,000 plurality, as against
29,000 plurality in New York City, and
Odell in 1902 the 131.000 with which he
beat 122,000 for Coler in the great city.

of one county and a well equipped Re

there had been juggling with transportation figures, causing enormous expense to the Government.

mitted Thursday afternoon while* half
the inhabitants of the village were ab
sent, attending the fall carnival.
Miss Florence Flood, daughter of
the president of Treynor . Savings
Bank, was in the bank alone when
a masked man entered and, pointing a
revolver at her head, ordered her. to
give him the money in the cash draw
er. She obeyed and he then ordered
her to go to the vault and hand him
whatever cash was there. As she
passed the money out, he pushed her
back into the vault and locked her in.
He made his escape in a buggy.
As soon as the robbery was discov
ered a posse was formed and the rob
ber was tracked to a point where he
abandoned his team and plunged in
to a corn field. Twenty-four hours
later the dogs arrived at this point
and at once took up the trail follow
ing it into the corn field to a spot
where the fugitive had apparently re
turned for a comrade supposedly
waiting for darkness. From this point
the dogs doubled back to Treynor and
made direct for Karrer's house, where
he was found. - Â¦}â¢

ing the mornir.g hoyjs and was received
with a salute. Shortly before noon Rear
Admiral McCalla introduced the Sen

of th3 Intrepid. Senator' Perkins spoke
as follows:
The decorations of the new ship were
elaborate, and flags of all kinds in the
vTtinity added color to the scene.
Eatallions of marines, companies of
sailors and the Mare Island station
band occupied positions near the new
ship. The workmen whose muscle and
skill had fashioned the vessel were
gathered in dense crowds about the
eayly decorated ship. Boats of all
kinds dotted the bay, and the wharves
and hillsides of Vallejo were black with
interested spectators, while almost
every flag in town was flying to the
breeze.
VALLEJO, Oct. 8.â At 12:11 p. m. to
day, amid the thunder of artillery, the
Falvos of steam whistles and the ex

It is now accepted here that the
reported naval tight off Port jFXrthur
was purely imaginary. The naval ex
perts of the newspapers dwell on the
difficulties which the Port Arthur
squadron must experience In .break
ing after- the disastrous sortie of Au
gust 10. The general opinion is that
thf. squadron could not venture out
unless something had happened to the
Jirpanepe warships, of which there Is

TOKIO. Oct. 8. â According to a pri
vate letter received from a Japanese
officer now with the besieging forces
before Port Arthur*, the Russians, are
effectively using hand grenades > Slcd
with a high explosive.. The exectSlon
of these grenades, when accurately
thrown, is deadly, the officer says, and
their use possibly accounts for the
closeness of the fighting.
-The troops and the vast crowd of
people were greatly affected by the
general's words. Dragomiroff then
kissed the colors, removed his bu3by
and bowed low to each battalion,
murmuring:
"Farewell. God bless you and
bring you back safely."

On the morning of July 28 the Jap
anese renewed the battle. The Kus
slan line broke and began to retreat.
Practically the entire Port Arthur
garrison, with sixty guns, participated
in this engagement. The Russian
losses were 1000. The Russians re
tired inside the last line of their de
fense. The Japanese spent July 29
disposing their forces and supplying
them with ammunition. At dawn
July 30 the J.iDanese attacked the
Russinn forts. The jruns of the Rus
sian' fortress were used for the first
time in this attack. The Japanese ad
vanced within two and four miles of
TOKIO. OcL i.â The Imperial
headquarters to-night published a |
series of extended reports covering I
the operations against P.ort Arthur j
until the end of July. The reports j
cover the operations between the toat- j
tie of Nanshan May 26 and. the actual !
investment of Port Arthur proper,;
which began July 30.. The reports are.-j
chiefly interesting as showing that tho !
Russians desperately resisted the Jt*-pwj
anese advance southward along the ;
peninsula. Indeed, the Russians' as- j
sumed the aggressive during July and '
attempted to drive the Japanese back J
and retake Dalny. The Russians â¢
erected an elaborate series of forti- i
flcations in the hills skirting the east- j
era coast and also along: the railway, ;
by means of which they delayed the '
actual investment of Port Arthur two !
full months. :
Many desperate encounters marked f
the slow advance of the Japanese j
southward early in June. The Rus- j
sians erected defense works east of J
Shihshankow. On June 13 the Rus- '
sians assumed the aggressive, but they '
were repulsed. The Russians then j
erected defenses at Soutaikou. The I
Japanese began the general advance j
June 26. After severe fighting they j
succeeded in occupying a line from j
Antzu Mountain on the right to Sout- '
ing Mountain on the left. On July 3
the Russians began a general attack, t
The fighting, which continued until !
the night of July 5, included desperate
night attacks, the men frequently
closing hand to hand and using |
bayonets. Russian destroyers and gun
boats â¢ came from Lungivangtao and
shelled the Japanese.. , The Russians
were finally beaten back.
The Russians next fortified Antzu
Pass. The Japanese mounted at
Langnichia twelve guns captured at
Nanshan and also naval twelve-pound- I
ers west of Chuantzunou. Desultory {
fighting succeeded until July 26, when |
the Japanese began a second general I
attack against Soutaikou and Antzu
Pass. All three of the Japanese
columns engaged in the desperate
fighting which raged until July 27.

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 8.â Prince
Khilkoff, Minister of Railroads has.ar
rived here after spending three
months in personally superintending
the construction of the Circum-Baikal
Railroad. He says the whole Siberian
line is working perfectly. The Circum-
Baikal branch is open for freight traf
fic, but passengers are still crossing the
lake in the ferry boats, that being the
shortest route; the ferry boat taking
two hours to steam across about thir
ty miles, whereas the trains take four
hours to cover the railroad route
around the lake, about seventy-three
miles. Work is still proceeding day
and night on the Circum-Baikal road,
electric lights being used at night, so
as to have the line in complete order
before the lake freezes over.

"The third is the splendid vessel be
fore you, now waiting the command to
glide into the waters of the bay and to
be christened by Miss de Young, one of
the fairest daughters of the Golden
State. The Intrepid, bold, fearless and
undaunted, may she long sail the seas
as one of the schoolhouses of the
American navy."
Chaplain McAlester stepped to the
front as- the applause that greeted
Perkins' words died away. He uttered
a short prayer, at the close of which
the Intrepid, released by the customary
mechanism, started toward the water.
As she did so Miss' Helen de Young,
daughter of M. H. de Young of San
Francisco, gracefully christened the
new ship. ' .'. .
The first rivet was driven and clinched
In the keel. of the Intrepid on January
2 last by Admiral B. H. McCalla, Mayor
P. B. Lynch and President of the
Chamber of Commerce Frank R. Dev
lin. The Intrepid is a sailing-vessel.
She will be propelled not by steam, but
by sail power entirely. She is to be a
training ship, and has been made a
sailing. ship in recognition of the doc
trine" now generally conceded by all
naval officers, foreign as well as Ameri
can, that the best school for a twen
tieth century man-df-warsman is a
sailing ship. The Intrepid will hs bark
rigged. Her dimensions are: Length,
176 feet 5 inches; beam,- 45 feet 7%
"The next of the name was built
during the '70's and was a steam
armored ram. but did not win distinc
tion.
"When in May, 1900, during the Box
er war, an appeal came for help from
the legations at Peking, China, our
fleet of war vessels on the Asiatic sta
tion made up a detachment of marines
and sailors, under command of Cap
tain B. H. McCalla, now admiral and
commandant of this navy yard, and
joined the relief column with Admiral
Seymour. You all remember how well
they did their work and saved the for
eign legations from annihilation. Our
naval officers and men won the highest
praise from all, and the British admiral
said of them: "Their post was usually
in the advance guard, where their zeal
and go was praised by all." Again,
last November, the prompt action of
the captain of the U. S. S. Nashville in
landing his troops at Colon, on the
isthmus of Panama, saved the lives of
many American citizens and prevented
the destruction of the city.
"It is, in my opinion, the duty of our
Government, in the interests of peace
and good order, to maintain a strong
navy and man it with American citi
zens. It seems therefore eminently
proper that we should assemble lor the
purpose of congratulating the com
mandant of this navy yard, the naval
architect, naval constructors and of
ficers that have directed the work, and>
the mechanics that have fashioned
and builded this excellent vessel.
"The name selected by the Navy De
partmentâthe Intrepidâ is the third of
the name in the navy to fly the Stars
and Stripes. The first named was for
merly a Tripolitan ketch called the
Mastico, that had been captured in 1803
by Lieutenant Stephen Decatur, after
ward Commodore Decatur, while In
command of the schooner Enterprise
during the war that the United States
waged against a set of pirates who in
fested the Mediterranean Sea and were
making raids upon American com
merce. The United States frigate Phil
adelphia while jn hot pursuit of a ves
sel that was running the blockade ran
upon a reef near the harbor of Tripoli.
The tide was falling and all efforts to
get her off failed. A few days later a
strong wind raised the waters and the
Tripolitans pulled the frigate off and
towed her to anchorage under the guns
of the fort. The work of destroying the
Philadelphia that she might not become
a part of the Tripolitan fleet was in
trusted to Lieutenant Decatur, who in
command of the Mastico. with a- picked
volunteer crew, entered the harbor and
successfully carried out the plan and
escaped without the loss of a man. This
achievement was pronounced by Lord
Nelson to be "the moat bold and. dar
ing act of the age.' The name of the
Mastico was changed to the Intrepid.
"The evolution of the American navy
excites the admiration of the world,
and its exploits during the recent Span
ish War has given it a stronger and
broader hold than ever before. The
United States has become a world pow
er for good, and our navy is a bond for
peace as well as an arm of protection
to our people in foreign lands and our
commerce on the seas.
Congress I call to mind the Mohican,
the Unadilla. the Pawtucket, the Les
lie, the Sotoyome, the double turreted
monitor Monadnock, the rebuilding of
the historic Hartford, Farragut's flag
ship at Mobile, and a large number
of barges and launches costing in the
aggregate several millions of dollars,
for which the Government has re
ceived full value, as every dollar was
paid out* for labor and material. All
repair work upon the ships of the
navy and United States transports
should be done In the navy yards,
which should be fully equipped with
all modern appliances.
"The navy is very dear to the Amer
ican heart. Its mention alone brings
a thrill of patriotic pleasure. It has
contributed some of the most brilliant
pages in our history. Its officers and
men are represented by citizens from
every State and Territory In the
Union, as every one of the 386 Con
gressional districts has a cadet at the
naval academy, while the President
appoints twenty additional cadets
from the sons of naval officers.
"The past half century has witnessed
a revolution in all things connected
with the navy. The wooden walls
have been replaced by walls of chilled
steej. The swelling sails have given
way to the propelling power of steam,
and "the man behind the gun" has
become master of the situation.
"While we do not number as many
ships as some of the other nations of
the world, yet for its size our navy is
the equal of any â and ship to ship,
manned by American " officers and
crew, it will never strike its colors.

he underwent an operation for a se
rious stomach trouble, and he never

the best known politicians and Journal

One of the most practical acts of
the .congress was to favor the estab
lishment in the leading cities of the
world of branches of the International
Peace Bureau at Berne, so that the
masses of the people might be brought
to the" understanding .that inter
national ' harmony amprig all people
was the sane and natural principle of
life. " Â¦:
Besides adopting resolutions de
nouncing war and calling for the
creation of international' obligatory
arbitration treaties, - the congress
passed upon specific conditions.
One of its last acts was to recom
mend an inquiry by the powers into
the Congo Free State, which is at
present under the personal rule of
King Leopold of Belgium. The pres
ent Russo-Japanese " w'ar was treated
by a resolution calling upon the Em
perors of the two countries to end the
conflict at once, or, that failing, for
the Dowers to exercise the authority
granted by article 27 of The Hague
treaty and intervene, so that the war
might be terminated. - . < >
In this connection the congress sug
gested to the powers the adoption of
a. positive peace-making and peace
insuring treaty under .which all war
will be possible but for a short period.
BOSTON", Oct. 8.â There were two
aspects memorable In their nature, ac
cording to s Jthe delegates themselves,
which made a pronounced impression
during the deliberations of the Inter
national ij Peace Congress, \yhlch was
brought to a close to-day after many
meetings extending throughout the
week. One of these was that the con
greps, together with the numerous
public gatherings, which were held
under its auspices^ .constituted one of
the most remarkable e'duc'atlonal Â¦ in
fluences ever observed in America.
The se,cond aspect or conviction was
that this year's congress should prove
of vast.- efficiency â¢â¢toward the attain
ment of universal peace, If an aroused
public 8e"ntiment and a thorough ex
position of the absurdity and horror
of warfare was to be of any avail
whatsoever. .. â¢> ,-.
The congress was adjourned to-day,
to continue its work in 1905 at Lu
cerne, Switzerland.
BOSTON. Oct. S.â The greetings of
the Anglican church In Canada were

Convention at a brief session to-day
by Right Rev. Charles Hamilton. Bish
op of Ottawa; Right Rev. James Car
mlchael. Bishop Coadjutorof llontrÂ«al.
and Dean Evans, also of 'Montreal.
Bishop Hamilton thought that {h*
United States might well adopt sonia of
the methods of dealing with divorce
which were in vogue in his . country,
where the courts which sever marriage
ties had little to do.
The business session of the conven
tion was ended at noon . for the, week.
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Bishops and deputies and the women's
auxiliary devoting the .afternoon to
sightseeing and a trip to Cambridge.
The Archbishop of Canterbury will
preach in Trinity Church to-morrow,
and the other Episcopal pulpits of the
city will be filled by Bishops or other
prominent churchmen.
It is announced that the divdrce ques
tion will be taken up by the convention
on Monday.
Richmond. Va.. is favored by many
delegates as the place for the conven
tion of 190 Â». and it is understood thata
committee, of which J. P. Morgan *is

who -were with 'the German forces at

LONDON, Oct. . 8.â When Andrew
Carnesie a few months ago expressed
a wish to provide a trade union hali
for London the idea was ridiculed by a
number of trades union leaders, who
cannot forget the great Pittsburg
strike. Meetings have been held pri
vately Fince the offer was made, and
although a large section of the labor
leaders are , opposed to having any
thing to do. with Carnegie or his\sur
plus dollars, there Is a responsible por
tion of them prepared to bury the
hatchet.
REVOLT AGAINST
KAISER'S RULE
CARNEGIE HALL
NOW IN FAVOR
erate of the labor leaders and the mil
lionaire. The views of the moderate
section have now, been placed before
Carnosie, and th'ere is every hope that
before he leaves for the United States
all the differences will be adjusted and
a Carnegie Trade Union Hall in 1 Lon
don will be an accomplished fact. .
It is estimated that a building, suffi
ciently large to accommodate the trade
unions of London and the surrounding
district can -be put up for about $150,
000. The expenses of furnishing would
not devolve upon Â¦ Carnegie, because
the various unions have sufficient fur
niture already that could be easily
moved into the new building. A site
hase been fixed upon in â¢ Grays Inn

The enormous dealings in United
States Steel preferred were accompa
nied by the assertion that the corpora
tion was buying thÂ« stock for conver
sion into second mortgage bonds, thus
reducing the standing charge by 2 per
cent on the capital concerned.' This as
sertion met with official disclaimers,
like many of the others in circulation.
But while the action of the market thus
continued under a degree of distrust
and suspicion, the scope of the move
ment and the breadth of the absorption
made its impression and held the un
dertone firm. Much was heard of the
closing out of very heavy lines of short
contracts which had been obstinately
held from a very early period of the
present advance in prices. After
the prolonged stick market de
cline of last year there was influential
opinion that that decline was a herald
of industrial and business reaction
which would permeate the whole coun
try and threaten our whole fabric of
credit, including the banking structure.
It Is only within a few weeks that thi
passing of this danger and the revival
of business confidence has been dis
tinctly recognized.
There is an element in the stock mar
ket .which maintains that the revival
of confidence Has been % exaggerated and
the stock market advance due to ma
nipulation. The persistence of this view
would have added to the severity of the
punishment of such an element in re
deeming the contracts based on that
assumption. The belief in the unset
tling influence *pt a Presidential cam
paign, the successive reductions which
have been allowed in the estimates of
the crops and the supposition that the
war in the Far East would have
drained the world's money markets of
available resources would have served
to convince the reactionists In their
persistence. These factors have all
failed of their effect on the markets.

afraid of him.
Early this morning Micholi gained
entrance into his wife's house through
a V\indr,\y. He was met by his wife in
the front room. Saying only "Hello"
he rushed at her, threw her to .the
floor and began to cut her In the back
of the neck with a razor. She turned
over and grabbed the weapon, cutting
her fingers to the bone. He cut sev
eral gashes in her throat, and then
seeing the blood flowing so freely be
came frightened and ran from the
house, but before going tried to keep
Carrie, the 12-year-old daughter of the
couple, from giving an alarm. The eld
est girl, Amelia, was sick in bed with
pneumonia and was unable to cry out,
although she went outdoors to do so.
Carrie ran to a neighbor, Mrs. Will
Shaw, and told her of the murderous
assault. By this time the neighbor
hood had been aroused, and those who
first reached the scene found Micholi
in the back yard wit^h his throat cut
from ear to ear. He was thought to
be dying and was not picked up until
after his wife had been cared for by
Dr. R. W. Obannon. x
Micholi was placed under arrest and
taken to the County Jail, where he I*
now confined. He acknowledges hav
ing committed the 'crime.
It is expected that both Micholi and
his wife will recover.
HOLLISTER, Oct. Â«.â Manuel Mich
oli tried to murder his wife early this
morning; with a razor. For some

moved to Hollister from San Felipe.
She has been supporting herself by
taking in washing. Micholi tried to
persuade her to live with him again
and took rooms opposite the houss
when* she lived. For some time he has
been visiting his wife and yesterday
afternoon he told her and his children
that they would not live long.
They did not suspect his terrible

An advance in prices is likely to be
well held until the knowledge becomes
public property, when some selling to
take profits usually causes a reaction.
Many of the rumors recently prevalent
have passed out of consideration with
out any confirmation, and the extrav
agant character of many of these ru
mors has served to arouse distrust.
Those of the past week have continued
to doal principally with the transcon
tinental railroad situation and have
pointed to a workout of a comparative
harmonization of control by a settle
ment of the Northern Securities con
test. St. Paul was the center of the
excitement from the opening on Mon-
Speculative excitement has been
largely in evidence during the week
and violent price movements have re
sulted from the curious activity of the
trading. With the progress of the
week it became clearer that a very
large distribution of speculative hold
ings had been achieved, and the. re
actionary, tendency awakened sus
picions that the powerful operators
who had been churning up the market
in the course of their campaign- had
disposed of large holdings and secured
their profits. Such being the case, the
efforts to stimulate a further advance
in prices might be expected to be dis
continued, and it was even feared that
the forces which had made for the rise
might turn their efforts toward the
side of reaction and seek a profit on
the short side, as well as secure an op
portunity to get back their holdings
at a r lower price level. The suspicious
attitude of a large element among the
professional operators was aggravated
by the lack of confirmation of most of
the rumors which put prices up.
RUMORS AROUSE DISTRUST.
The weekly mercantile reviews were
cheerful to a degree that went far to
corroborate the growing belief in sub
stantial business revival, and the ex
pansion of tlje week's bank clearings
the country over was additional evi
dence for this view. The reduction in
surplus reserves to $12,636,900 brings
that item below that for the corre
sponding period last year for the first
time this season, the figure for last
year having been $16,577,125.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $1,
775,000.
REVIEWS ARE CHEERFUL.
Revised estimates were in circulation
this morning, which prepared senti
ment for the heavier decline in cash
reserves than was indicated by the
known movements of currency. Tho
Increase in loans, although small,
served to discountenance the view of
heavy market liquidation during the
week. The enormous credit balances
of more than $17,000,000 at the Clearing
house of one of the great banks re
awakened the surmises of great trans
actions among the controlling interests
in the railroad Held.
NEW YORK, Oct. S.â The stock mar
ket made a strong: demonstration to
close the week and dissipated the re
actionary appearance which had fol
lowed the week's opening strength.
The features to-day were United
States Steel preferred and the South
westerns. The movement in the for
mer was apparently in connection with
the sanguine forecasts by persons hav
ing oflieial connection with the trade.
The rise in the Southwepterns was at
tributed to the increasing estimates of
the corn and cotton yields, which find
currency in financial circles. Union
Pacific's showing of net earnings for
August was helpful to that stock.
The market was sluggish and 'rather
irregular until the appearance of the
bank statement in apprehension of
what Its effect would be, and prices
wavered about the time it appeared,
but the final dealings brought active
buying and the market closed strong
and active.

THE VALUE OP CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Ussful It Ig in Pre-
serving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient j
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose. . i
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of if the better; it is not a
i drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and Impurities always present
in. the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating ;
onions and other odorous vegetables, i
Charcoal effectually clears and im- '
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural;
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which !
collect in the stomach and bowels; it \
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
AU druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money is j
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they:
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz-
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
Eoon tell in a much Improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is that no possible
.harm can result from their continued
use, but, on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal In Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets.'.'

John Sapunar first came to Nogales,
Sunora. ten years ago from Brazil. He
la a native of Switzerland and has had
a hand in every scheme to smuggle
Chinamen across the border in recent
years. He was associated with Frank
Howe, Louis Greenewaldt, C. A. Sprtng-
Ftoin and other famous smugglers,
whose operations have been broken up
by Government officers. Sapunar him
self never ventured across the line un
til all of his old lieutenants were cap
tured or dead, but at his house in No
prales Chinamen destined for the United
States made their headquarters, and
the upper rooms rrere a storehouse for
poods destined for points across the
line.
Th<' case was immediately reported
to the United States .Grand Jury, in
prssion at Tucson, and Sapunar was
indicted on several counts.
TUCSON. Ariz.. Oct. 8.â John Sapu
nar. the la?t of a noted gang of Mexi
i an border is ln custody. He
wag tak^n after a hard fight by mount
ed Immigration inspectors near Xo
pales. Papunar was caught in the act
of smuggling threp Chinamen across
the line, but when overtaken the party
scattered and hy a mere accident Sapu
nar succeeded in petting the drop on
The officer who pursued him and made
good his escape, only to be rounded up
the next day by a large force of border
'â¢fflcers.
J. D. Milton, a roving inspector Fta
tioned in Sonora. found that Sapunar
was planning to smuggle a party of
Chinamen across the line west of No
gales, and accordingly arranged to in
tercept him on the night set for the
deed. Acc<nnpanied by G. IT. Tuttle,
James B. Gamble and G. D. Gonzales,
all mounted inspectors, he set out for
the spot where the crossing was to taktÂ»
place.
The trail led up a lonely canyon. Mil
ton stationed two of his men on one
Fide and in company with the third
took up his position on the other. They
did not have to wait long, for in a short
time they spied four forms winding
# al<-Â«ng the trail in the canj'on below.
Milton called to the men to throw up
their hands, but instead of obeying
they scattered, and the inspectors, be
ing unable to take good aim in the
pale moonlight, failed to bring them
down with their guns. Each officer
picked a man and pursued him. It
turned out that Gonzales was follow
ing th^ smuggler. Sapunar. He fled
up the canyon on the American side,
and although unmounted was able, be
uufe of the roughness of the country,
to make as good progress as his pur-
Fucr. (lonzah's had followed him for
rrarly two hours and was close on his
h**^Is when his horse, which was a
ptrange animal, began to cause him
trouble. Sanunar took advantage of
the situation to turn suddenly on thc
officer and level a sawed -off shotgun
â¢which he carried at the head of the in
epector. The smuggler had the drop
and Gonzalea knew it. He obeyed Sa
lunar's command to turn back on the
trail and ride off without daring to
lnnk behind, while the smuggler escaped
over the ridge.
It was long aftpr midnight when Sa
lunar thus escaped, fcnd by daylight
<:< r:z.i]p? had slvon the alarm and a
rfozen officers were scouring the coun
try for the smuggler. They rounded
him up in an obscure canyon not far
fiom the line. He was making his way
by a round-about trail.

Senator Dolllver also | discussed the
irrigation problem and referred to the
agency of Secretary Wilson in the work
of reclaiming the arid lands.
' ADDRESSES THE 3IINERS.
"The President brought the subject
to' the attention :of Congress in his an
nual message in December, 1901. It was
never more happily put than by him,
and the law now in' force- follows the
lines so weir laid down by the Presi
dent. This great measure, fraught with
such beneficence to our country and to
our. countrymen j in the future, will
stand as a tribute to. Republican states
manship. It is one of the great trophies
of the Republican administration. The
reclamation fund derived from the sale
of public lands amounts to about $2",
000,000. and it will be greatly increased
by future sales. The' owners- of the
lands will restore .the. fund_ from time
to time, and it will be used in the fur
ther extension of : the system until all
irrigable lands have been substantially
brought under cultivation, â¢ without
drawing upon any of - the revenues of
the Government save only those which
arise from t>ublic lands. . . - â¢
"The -attempt of the Democratic Na

unfounded in fact. It was recommend
ed by President Roosevelt and enacted

'Senator and his party were immediate

When the party left Senator War

in order to attend two meetings which
had been arranged r for them. Both
these meetings were crowded and the
speakers were all received with favor.
Senator Warren presided at one and
General Van Orsdel at the other. Sen
ator Fairbanks spoke at both meetings.
In both of his speeches Senator Fair
banks entered upon a general review
of the campaign,, giving considerable
attention to questions especially af
fecting the West. Considering this as
probably his last speech in the irriga
tion section, he referred to the Demo
cratic claim of authorship of the recla
mation law. On that subject he said,
in effect:
"I have been greatly impressed aB I
have traveled through the arid regions
of the Weet with the tremendous pos

conducting a thorough political can

article XIII, section 1, of the constitu

Its resources and usefulness by taxa

* In answer to the communication the
Republican Central Committee said the
executive committee of the governing
body of the Republican party In the
State had determined that the joint
Senatorial convention of the Twenty
ninth Senatorial District, which met in
Redwood City, San Mateo County, on
September 26, and of which W. J. Mar

secretary, was the convention recog
nized by the central committee as the
legal one and S. H. Rambo the legal
nominee. As the difficulty has now
been settled all Republicans will lend
their aid to elect the candidate.
The California Academy of Sciences
has issued a circular calling for the
support on the part of the people of the
proposed amendment to article IX of
the State constitution, to exempt from
taxation the property of the academy
in this city. In the circular the acad
emy sets forth first its purposes, and
then states that its property consists
chiefly of a building fronting on Mar
ket ... street, the income ofthe front
building supporting that in the rear, in
which the academy's exhibits are in
stalled, and that without this "income
the work of the academy could not be
carried on. Continuing the â¢ circular
says: " : 'â¢ â¢
"The academy pays over $7000 a year
for taxes: Of this amount less than
one-third goes to the State at large, the
rest to the city and county of San
Francisco. This tax impoverishes the
academy, the balance of its income he
ing, insufficient to do its work. Similar
institutions in other States, such as the

"I suffered untold agony with piles
for over three years. Two doctors told
me nothing but an operation would cure
me. I tried different remedies, but
nothing did me any good until I used
Pyramid Pile Cure. I bought six 50-ceiit
boxes at ihe drug store, and now I can
do my work and go out. where before
I pnent most of my time lying Vlown. I
thank God for giving the discoverer the
knowledge to make puchacure. I recom-
mend it to all my friends, and if I ever
have piles again will certainly use this
rrrnarkaiile remedy. You can use this
in any way you wish to make known
the wonderful merit of Pyramid Pile
Cure." Mrs. Wm. Mucky, SI Marshall
street. Elizabeth. N. J.
The experience of this lady is that of
1 hoy sands of others who have been as-
sured ,that nothing short of an opera-
tion would rid them of this distressing
complaint. On the face of it. it appears
as if too many surgeons operate in or-
der that they may keen their hand in
and lose no portion of their skill: then,
again, too many surgeons an? anxious
to experiment (like the scientific man
In Mark Twain's pathetic story of the
dog and her little puppy), and do not
have proper regard for a patient's phy-
sical welfare or condition.
We advise every sufferer to think
twice before submitting to an operation
for piles, and suggest that those inter-
ested write to the Pyramid Drug Co.,
Marshall. Mich., for their little book on
the causep and cure of piles, which is
Â»ent free for the asking.

SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 8. â There
is much agitation among the negroes
here to-niirht over the action of the
management of a new cafe which was
opened here last week to supply meat
and drink to the ultra-fashionable.
The cafe made a start as a swell place
and the announcement was given out
that measures would be taken to keep
the "choles" and negroes from the
place. This was enough to make
some of the local darkies risk their
necks to get Into the place and six of
them walked into the b'ar this after
noon and called for drinks. Their
money was pushed back across the
counter with the information that
drinks were S12 each. Shortly after
ward four others tried and were given
the same reception. Then they went
out to see a lawyer and are now trying
to raise the necessary funds to bring
suit against the manager of the place.
The manager of the place said to
night that the law prevented him from
refusing meals or drinks on account
of color, creed or condition, but that
there Is no law th'at will fix the price
of his wares and that if 512 Is not
beyond the reach of his black brethren
he proposes to raise the price again.

PORTLAND. Oct. 8. â ;Major H. L.
Rees, acting chief paymaster located
at Portland, and. who is In charge of
the funds of the Department of the
Columbia, has been relieved from duty
pending an Investigation of his ac
counts^ The money In' his care 'â was
turned ' over to-day to Assistant Pay
master F. R. Day. The action was
taken as the result of an inspection of
the affairs of the local office by
Colonel C. S. Mills. Inspector general.
United States army, who came here
from Washington a week ago.
On his arrival here last Monday
Colonel Mills relieved Major Rees
from duty, pending investigation.
Colonel Mills has spent the week
checking the chief paymaster's ac
counts and finds that the amount
of money on hand corresponds with
.the -books. There . is no apparent
defalcation, a Investigation of his af
fairs was the result of complaints
that had reached the deoartment con
cerning Major Rees' methods of busi
ness.
Some time ago, it is alleged, he In
volved a brother officer in a loss by
giving him a check on a bank in
which he had no' funds deposited. A
similar complaint, involving a larger
amount, was sent to Washington a
week ago by the proprietors of the
Belvedere Hotel and the '.Louvre res
taurant. For years Major Rees > was a
patron at the hotel and several months
ago he presented a check on the First
National Bank for $400, which was
cashed without question. The check
was protested at 'the bank, as-Ttees
had no funds to his personal account.
â¢The hotel" men have an account of
$100 against the major. He has prom
ised repeatedly to settle both" accounts,
but has hot done' so.' -. .

-AT THE. RESORTS.
"A Japanese Nightingale," which
will be presented for the first time on
this coast by the Oliver Morosco Com
pany at the Majestic Theater this
evening, .will, in addition to its great
spectacular settings and array of Jap
anese costumes of the richest charac
ter, be noteworthy from the contrast
afforded by the appearance of Miss
Eleanor Gordon as Theodosia Harker
in one ol Worth's latest Parisian de
signs. As she is the only American
Kirl Jn the play, Miss Gordon's gown
will be brought out in strong relief
ngainstthe -settines of scene and cos
tuming, peculiar to the Orient.
.' The production of "A Japanese
Nightingale" at the Majestic Theater
will equal the presentation given the
drama in -e\v. York by Klaw & Er
langer, from whom it was secured by
H. -W. Bishop by special arrangement.
It will ,be one of the greatest produc-'
tloris ever * undertaken by any stock
house in the "West.

XOOX LUNCHES.
To Interest the Women.
GRAPE-NUTS.
A bright young business woman who
lives in a big city says:
"This is in reference to noon lunches
for working women. I have had' much
trouble about my lunch, getting rather
tired cf the cold lunches I brought and
which Â«ue not very appetizing by the
time the noon hour comes.
"I had heard so muchtabout Grape-
Nuts I determined to try that food, so
had a local creamery deliver half a
pint of cream to the. office every day at
noon and this, with Grape-Nuts, of
which I kept a pkg. In the office, I
found greatly added to the meal.
â¢â¢Then gradually I ceased to use any-
thing but the Grape-Nuts and cream
and for the last four months have had
nvthing but this fon lunch and am per-
fectly satisfied, am better and stronger
In nerves, body' and brain and enjoy
the glow of perfect health.
"My lunch now costs me about 6c a
day and I have gained 25 pounds. I
hope some working Rirl who Is bothered
about what to have for lunch will pro-
fit by this." Name given by Postum
Co., Battle Creek, Mich.
Try Grape-Nuts 10 days and prove
for yourself what a scientifically made
food will do. - â¢%,-:;

ON THE SAFETY OF OVER-
EATING.
The Rale of Choosins the I/esscr jpt
Tito Evils Applies to the
Way You Eat.
I want to know how a man Is to
know when he has bad enough.
The Pilgrim Fathers, I believe, had
,-a quaint sayins to the effect that you
â¢shculd always rise from the table feel-
ting as If you could eat pome more.
But the Question is. how much more?
Just when to stop?
That's the point.
The rule is wrong, because lt Is no
rulo at ail.
It is inexact and unscientific
II is likely to lead to the dangerous
habit of eating too HÂ»fl^, .
And mating too little â or digesting too
little, which amounts to the same thing
. â {* the cause of nine-tenths at the dis-
.f-ares Iroai which humanity Euffers to-
day.
What is iOiseAse? ,. ,
It is dimply uneven balance between
"wime'and repair.
. Some orcan lacks strength to earry'
on the eyecial work for which " it" wat ;
created.
Where shall lt find the strength It
lacks?
In drugs?
Ten thousand times, NO!
Better die than become a hopeless
drug 15 end.
No; in food.
"But." you say. "I eat a plenty of
good food every day:"
Truf. dear Irlend; but you dont di-
gest !L
And fcod, undigested.' Is mere 'poi-
son.
Bo, to make food do you good, you
" must take Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
The .great thing about Stuart'a Dys-
pepsia Tablets is that their action does
not depend upon stimulative dxuggery.
They cannot create a habit.
.' They contain no ingredients to "pick
you up." "tone up your nervous eye-
! tern" or furnish whip energy, by calling
â¢ out your vital reserve force.
They create new Ptrenpth, force and
. energy â out of your food.
If taken Ftarving, they will do you
no grood at elL
So, eat to live and live to eat with
' Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
The curso cf our present civilization
Is exhaustion.
And exhaustion, whether of brain,
nerves, physical strength or vital force,
Is caused by starvation.
Of two evils, it Is better to overeat
â¢â¢(and prevent indigcEtion with Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablet?) than to rise from
. the table not having eaten enough to
repair the exhaustion of your vital
' forces.
For exhaustion or starvation leads to
: the most varied forms of sickness or
disease, brought on by inability .of the
-weakened vitality to counteract the
dif^25? â poisons and microbes.
, Whereas, the weil-fed arid' well-nour-
ished person, without ever feeling the
' w-orse for Jt. can expose himself to dan-
pfrp. thÂ» mere thought of, which. would
drive the wÂ«*ak, starveling dyspeptic
.into a panic fit.
Good food, well digest'*!, is the great
.Ferret of a healthful existence here oh
earth. â¢ â¢
So eat heartily, every day, of the best
food you can. get and regulate the
"working of your dicreFtive machinery
â¢with Ptunrt's Pyepopsia Tablets.
As a result, you will be 'astonished to
f-r Â¦! h- Â¦'.-.- much stronger and lirelier'you
'f â¢Â»<Â¦Â¦!. how :nurh mere .and better work
you fnr. do. ho^v much rooro pleasure
i will p"t out of life and how your
0 rnemy, that chronic trouble which
ha* "upon your weak spot.
wherever it is. will up and away and

DISTINGUISHED IRISHMAN
LIBERALLY ENTERTAINED
ROME, Oct. 8.â As the Pope wished

fore his departure for the Philippines,

BERLIN. Oct. 8.â Militarism seems
likely to be execrated more than ever
In this country as the result of the un
commonly deadly maneuvers which re
cently came to an end. Public indig
nation is keen over the amazing num
ber of fatalities and accidents which
have marked the mimic battlesâ a num
ber, as has been said, not far short
of what might have been expected had
the strife been real.
These mishaps, the real total of
which was not given In the first re
ports, were particularly numerous in
those brilliant cavalry charges which
the Kaiser delights to witness, but
which would be Impossible In real war
fare. In one of them over fifty men
were unhorsed and more or less badly
hurt. In another, where the opposing
cavalry forces were brought Into close
contact, a trooper ran his lance clear
through a hussar, killing: him on the
spot. Another lancer -wounded an op
posing hussar in the leg. injuring him
so seriously that the member had to be
amputated. During a cavalry charge
at Schoenhausen two officers and twen
ty men were unhorsed and Injured,
some fatally. In another sham fight In
the same district the results were still
more disastrous, forty-eight men being
tumbled out of their saddles and sev
eral of them were killed.
In other branches of the service so
called accidents were far less numer
ous, but there -were enough of them
to show that sham fighting as conduct
ed by the Kaiser is by no means all
"make believe." A private of the Nine
ty-ninth Infantry Regiment -was shot
dead. In the Kaiser's own regiment of
the Guard3 a private was shot in the
eye and permanently blinded. At Mu
bleneischen during an artillery contest
a private attached to one of the field
batteries had both his legs blown off.
An officer was severely injured by the
explosion of a military balloon, and a
similar explosion cost a corporal his
life. In an infantry attack a sergeant
was killed and a lancer pierced a dra
goon, fatally wounding him.
In America or England such a Ions
list of killed and wounded resulting
from what are supposed to be blood
less engagements would arouse a storm
of popular indignation that could.be
abated only by an investigation and
the punishment of those responsible
for the blunders. But In Germany that
is impossible. It could not be done
without involving the Emperor him
self and open criticism of his sacred
person is "lese majeste" of the worst
kind.
Another source of dissatisfaction with
these maneuvers, and which greatly
impairs their military value, is the fact
that the Kaiser always insists on being
on the winning side. The umpires' de
cisions are governed by the necessity
of paying tribute to his Infallibility.
On the first day of the maneuvers he
assumed the command of the red. or
Invading army, and was credited with
winning a brilliant victory over the
luckless blue, or defending army. Next
day he gave a demonstration of his
Napoleonic genius by changing sides
and leading the blues, with the result,
according to the complaisant head
quarters staff, that the reds were
soundly thrashed.
In previous years this great war
lord, who has never .been under flre.
has won similar triumphs over vet
erans who went through the Franco-
Prussian war. Sub rosa. many of them
declare that the Kaiser plays the war
game like an amateur, that he really
has very little knowledge of strategy
and that in actual battle several of
the armies with which he Is credited
on paper with winning brilliant vic
tories Avould have suffered crushing de
feats. They say that In maneuvering
an army he makes no adequate alfow
ance for what the ether side might do
'f well led and that, as the umpires
similarly ignore such considerations
and always award him the fight, he
has never discovered how much he
has yet to learn to make a capable
leader. Nor will he, unless In an evil
day for Germany he should undertake
to lead a German army against an
actual foe commanded by a man who
understands his business.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Oct. 8.
In a fit of boyish despondency Vin
cent Lerri, a youth twenty years of
age, residing at 368 Fourth street, made
two determined efforts to end his life
this evening, both of which were frus
trated by his brother. The last attempt
came near being successful, and it re
quired an hour's work by Dr. Emerson
before the young man was declared
out of danger.
Young- Lerri, who Is son of the late
Joseph Lerri, a deputy sheriff who was
killed in the blowing up of the fuse
works at Melrose several years ago,
secured a bottle of strychnine at Os
good Brothers' drug store early this
evening, and, returning home, mixed
some of It in a glass and was about
to drink it when his brother took the
poison from him and broke the bottle.
A few moments later tne young man
procured another bottle of poison. This
time he did not return home. He stop
ped at a water trough and putting
seme, water with the poison drank of
the mixture- His brother, suspecting
his intention, had followed him from
the house and on reaching him knock
ed the bottle from his hand. The would
be suicide was hurried nome and Dr.
Emerson called, and after an hour of
work declared the patient out of dan
ger.
When the bottle of poison was struck
from young Lerri's hand it fell Into the
v\ater trough. A few minutes after
ward a dog drank of the water and
v. as poisoned.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. 8.
County Clerk Cook to-day received
from E. B. Helfenstein. State secretary
of the Socialist party In California, a
fonr.al protest against the placing of
names of Democratic nominees for the
Assembly in the Forty-seventh, Forty
ninth, Fiftieth and Fifty-first Assem
bly districts on the ticket at the coming
election.
The Socialist protest is based on the
allegation that the Democratic nomi
nees for those four offices failed to re
ceive 3 per cent of the total vote at the
last election. The law preventing the
placing of party candidates on a. ticket
when such party failed to poll 3 per
cent of the vote at the preceding elec
tion is cited as a reason why the Coun
ty Clerk should now refrain from put
ting the nominees in the Assembly dis
tricts referred to on the ticket.
Clerk Cook will ignore the protest. He
explains that the reason why the Dem
ocratic nominees in the Assembly dis
tricts failed to receive 3 per cent of the
vote cast two years ago was because
the Democrats fused with the Labor
party so far as these nominations were
concerned, and, of course, no votes
were cast there for any Democratic
candidate for the Assembly.
The Democratic candidates whom
Clerk Cook says he will place on the
ticket are as follows: Forty-seventh
District, J. N. Joseph; Forty-ninth,
John Shay: Fiftieth. P. J. Ryan; Fifty
first, R. Slaughter. The Republican
candidates in the same districts are E.
K. Strowbridge, J. J. Burke, J. A. Bliss
and R. H. E. Espey.

Congressman LJvernash .Makes an Ad

Congressman E. J. Livernash spoke
last evening at the first formal meet
ing of his campaign. The meeting,
â¢which was well attended, was held at
Carmen's Hall, 310 O'Farrell street.
Michael Casey presided and Mr. Liv
ernash's argument was augmented by
Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the
Sailors* Union of the Pacific Coast,
Â¦who spoke at length. In addressing
the meeting Mr. Livernash said in
part:
"This being the first formal meeting
of my campaign for re-election as a
member of the House of Representa
tives, it seems becoming that I brief
ly outline what I believe my candidacy
represents.
"My candidacy means a desire to !
f tay the President from doing things j
the constitution says shall be done, if
at all, by Congress: a desire to pre
vent majorities in Congress from ig
noring or transgressing the rights of
minorities, as those rights exist by vir
ture of the essence of representative
government: a desire that the Phil
ippine problem shall be settled with
fine regard for the declaration of in
dependence, but with complete ab
sence of partisanship, as becomes a
mighty nation dealing with millions of
less fortunate fellow creatures; a de
sire for altering a number of tariff
schedules, one by one, after careful
inquiry, where the abuses practiced
by trusts have made it clear thai
change can be effected with advantage
to domestic industry in general; a de
eire for destroying some trusts and
curbing others, where operations are
against the common welfare â trusts
Â¦which are, while creatures of corpo
ration Jaw. creatures of the state, us
ing their power not for reasonable
purposes but to impose upon society
extravagant taxation of all consum
ers, and this for the selfish advantage
of a handful of plutocrats; a desire
for making the Government as con
siderate an employer as are those pri
vate employers who have agreed with
workmen that eight hours a day shall
tae the ordinary time of toil; a desire
for limiting the use of the writ of in
junction to its ancient purposes and
for preventing 1 it being used to
undermine human liberty; a desire for
discouraging the martial spirit so
prevalent in American life in so far as
the influence of Theodore Roosevelt
reaches, and for cultivating the amity
Washington eo urgently recommended
to the people whose greatest patriot
he will ever be; a desire for restoring
our flag to the seven seas; a desire for
crushing involuntary servitude among
our seamen; a desire for the exercise
of greater caution in the regulation of
immigration: a desire for the utmost
care in dealing with the negro prob
lem; a desire for the rapid growth of
San Francisco, in population, In man
ufactures, in commerce, in culture."

mony had been performed, to-day filed
suit for divorce from Walter C. Ingalls,
alleging desertion.
Ingalls is a conductor employed by
the Southern Pacific Company. Hi^

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. 8.
The resolutions were signed by all
the members of the escort committee.
On receiving them Sir Knight Edwards
made a suitable reply expressing his
appreciation of the honor shown him
by his fraters. - "
During the course of the evening
Colonel Edwards responded to a toast
for the official escort and Captain Gains
for Oakland Commandery. Other toasts
were responded to by^Major Toohey,
Senator Ralston, Major Filmer, Cap
tain Woodslde, Lieutenant de Lamar,
Lieutenants Martins. Crossman and
Browne, and George S. Fodera.
The gathering was one of the. mer
riest ever assembled under one roof in
this city. As the visitors from across
the bay were obliged either to catch
the last boat, or stay in the city over
night it broke up earlier than is cus
tomary at affairs of this. kind. "/On
their way to the ferry the members of
Oakland Commandery, with the treas
ured flag, w'ere escorted down Market
street by a delegation from -Golden
Gate Commandery. At the ferry depot
they parted with mutual congratula
tions, all carrying home memories of a
pleasant evening.
ESCORTED TO FERRY.
"Resolved, That a copy of these res
olutions be suitably engrossed and pre
sented to our loved f rater, the sub
ject of these resolutions."
"Resolved, That through their offi
cers the conclave escort, consisting of
Sir Knights from Oakland Command
ery No. 11 and Golden Gate No. 16,
do hereby express their utmost appre
ciation, confidence, love and esteem
toward the same Sir William Edwards,
past commander of Golden Gate Com
mandery No. 16, Knights Templar.
And be it further
"Whereas, Eminent Sir William Ed
wards, past commander of Golden Gate
Commandery No. 16, was chairman of
the escort committee of the Twenty
ninth annual conclave of the Knights
Templar and was in full charge and
control of the escort parties acting
under his orders and acting under au
thority of the Grand Commandery of
the Knights Templar; and
"Whereas. Through the foresight and
untiring efforts on the part of said Sir
William Edwards, the reception and es
corting of our arriving Sir Knights to
this conclave were made a conspicuous
and brilliant feature of the general hos
pitality to our visiting fraters, which
contributed in a marked degree to the
signal success of this gloribus carnival,
now, therefore, be it
WORDS OF ESTEEM.
After the presentation of the flas
toasts were appropriately responded to
by members of both 'commanderies and
the following set of resolutions, splen
didly engrossed on parchment, were
presented to Sir Knight Edwards.
The presentation of the flag to Oak
land Commandery was made by Cap
tain Trebell, who said in part: "I hope
that no sir knight will ever do anything
"by word or deed that will dull the colors
of this the flag we love. Its brilliant
colors have remained unsullied for
years; none has dared insult it without
meeting prompt and deserved punish
ment, and it is safe to say that no one
will ever do so. In presenting this to
ken to you, fraters of Oakland, we of
Golden Gate Commandery feel that we
are handing to our brothers a token
which they will appreciate. In behalf
of Golden Gate Commandery I present
you with this flag."
The speech of Captain Trebell was
greeted with rounds of applause, and
when the handclapping had died away
Captains Gains and Richards accepted
the token in behalf of Oakland Com
mandery. They expressed in glowing
terms their appreciation of the cour
tesy shown them by their fraters. Am
ple assurance was given that all mem
bers of Oakland would stand by thft
flag of the country while life lasted.
In the opinion of the speakers, the
flag, the emblem of liberty, equality
and fellowship of man to man. was the
finest thing that could possibly be pre
sented. The speakers were greeted
with rousing cheers and toasts were
drunk to the flag, the commanderies
and the speakers.
Colonel Edwards of 'Golden Gate Com
mandery presided at the festal board
and made an excellent master of cere
monies. Covers were laid for 100 and
every seat was filled. The room was
appropriately decorated for the occa
sion, the Templar colors dominating.
An excellent menu was served, and at
its close surprises were sprung on mem
bers of both commanderies. In behalf
of Golden Gate Commandery escort
Captain Trebell arose and presented to
Oakland Commandery escort a splendid
silk American flag, eight feet by four.
On its red bars are embroidered the
words, "Presented to the escort of Oak
land Commandery Xo. 11 by Golden
Gate Commandery No. 16âTwenty
ninth Triennial Conclave."
This was the first of the surprises of
the evening. The second came when
Colonel Edwards of Golden Gate Com
mandery was presented with a set of
engrossed resolutions signed jointly by
the members of Golden Gate and Oak
land commanderies.
TRIBUTE TO FLAG.
An informal banquet of the escort
committees of Golden Gate Comman
dery No. 16 and Oakland Commandery
No. 11, which acted during the recent
Knights Templar conclave, was held
in the banquet hall of the Lick House
last night. .
NEW YOORK, Oct. 8.â The Financier
says this week: The strong features of
the official statement of the New York
Associated Banks of the last week were
a further expansion of loans to a new
high record, a decrease in cash by $1,
500,000 greater than the sum which was
estimated upon the traceable move
ments of money during the week and
a reduction in the surplus reserve to
within about $3,000,000 of the lowest
point of the year. The expansion in
loans since August 27 has been $46,932,
000, the decrease in cash since August
20 was $47,049,800 and the reduction in
the surplus reserves since that date
$45,976,175, while the net decrease in de
posits during this interval has been
$4,249,500. The loans were increased last
week by $2,955,300, probably by the re
sult of commission-houses' and syndi
cate borrowings and also operations in
finance bills. The cash decreased $9,
156,800, or $1,533,400 more than the esti
mated sum. This discrepancy may be
accounted for by large indirect trans
fers of excess internal revenue collec
tions for interior depositories on the
last day of the bank week, and atso by
the bringing over of the difference be
tween the estimated and the actual loss
of cash in the Drevious week. The de
posits were decreased by $7,521,100, a
larger weekly contraction than has
been shown during the year. The re
sulting decrease in required reserve was
$1,880,275, deducting which sum from
the loss of cash left $7,276,525 as the re
duction in the surplus- reserve to $12,
636,900. Computed upon the basis of
deposits, less those of $23,218,500 public
funds, the surplus is $18,441,525; at the
corresponding date last year the sur
plus calculated upon general deposits
was $16,577,125, and in 1902 it was $1,527,
850. The statement failed to prove, the
sum of the loss of cash less the gain in
loans calling for a reduction in deposits
of $6,201,500, or $1.3i9,600 smaller than
was shown by the return. There was
an increase of $1,215,000 in circulation,
chiefly by the large commercial banks.
The daily average of clearings during
the week was $285,000,000, or $60,000,000
more than in the previous week. The
clearings on Saturday, reflecting Fri
day's business, were $292,889,447. or
much above the average. Comparing
changes in loans, five banks increased
this item by $1,000,000 net, four banks
lost $8,000,000 cash and one institution
decreased this item by nearly $9,000,000.

In the days before John Alexander
Dowie blossomed out as Elijah Third
and before he dreamed his dream of
Zion, as a community in which he
should be the sole property-owner, he
was doing missionary work in Cali
fornia. This was in 18S8 and at that
eftrly period he showed an aptitude for
thfr use of the money of others. He
left a debt here amounting to $2727 36,
on which ho later paid $962 46. but
no more. Pressed for payment on his
way to Australia last January he said
that he did not deem the debt a moral
or legal obligation. Thereupon he was
sued by Hugh Craig, who had been
Elijah's raven in the time of heed.
The trial of the case began yester
day morning in Judge Murasky's court
and will continue to-morrow. Dowie
was not present. Craig told something
or his relations with the prophet and
hraler. The Oakland capitalist said
that he owed a debt of gratitude to
Dcwie, which, however, was not an
offset to the financial claim. When
Dowie was here he spent much of his
time at the Craig home and by the
laying on of hands had cured Craig's
daughter of a painful shoulder trouble
and relieved Mrs. Craig of a serious
throat affection.
Dowie had known Craig's father in
Sydney, Australia, and when he came
here in 1SS8 he brought a letter of
introduction from the elder Craig.
Dcwie began holding mission meet
ings and Craig took an interest in them.
The flfth meeting was to be held at
the Grand Opera-house, but the
prophet was without funds and Craig
agreed to finance the undertaking. The
mission was not a financial success and
Craig frequently asked Dowie for pay
ment. Dowie, who was spending from
one to three weeks at a time at Craig's
home, said he had no money but ex
pected remittances from Australia.
These never came. The religious man
remarked that it embarrassed him and
hurt his â¢work to be reminded of his
debt and Craig desisted.
Crai^ saw the prophet several times
in Chicago, where Elijah always anti
cipated reference to his obligation by
pleading poverty. Later Dowie wrote
that he had prayed for' a blessing on
Craig and his family. Craig replied
that the prayer was all right, but it
did not pay the account and that with
al! of his claims for spiritual and su
pernatural powers, Dowie surpassed
all the men of his (Craig's) acquaint
ance In handling money that did not
belong to him. He called Dov.'ie's at
tention to the fact that he had never
made any return for all the courtesies
given him here.
"On the morning of his arrival here,
January 19 last," said Mr. Craig, "two
cf Dowie's saints called at my office
nnd left a letter. The letter said that
Dowie had talked to his counsel, V. V.
Barnes, and another, on his special
Pullman car In which they traveled
and they understood his views about
the debt. With my attorney I called
on the two representatives at the Pal
ace Hotel and told them the whole
story of the debt. They said thac it
coincided with Dowie's version, but ne
did not consider it a moral or legal
obligation, but if the Craigs were in
need he would give Mrs. Craig a pres
ent of $500.
"I told Barnes," the l witness con
tinued, "that the Craig family wasn't
exactly in need; that I had paid the
last month's bills and thought I could
scratch through another month and
unless he could pay 51764 90 he need
not pay anything and I would sue. I
wanted no contributions from the
Dowie outfit for the Craig family."
The cross-examination of Craig by
Dowie's attorney related largely to the
dates of missions conducted by Dowie
during his stay on the coast and the
p!:in of the defense was not disclosed.

and locked up in "the tanks" at the
City Prison. A charge of felony embez

liioa ks the complaint is swern to lo-
r â¢Â¦>!â¢: cm.
.'ac :>s is 23 years of age and has
itvtn in the company's service for the
i asi six years. He became engaged to
x vocsg lid/ * n Oakland, and his desire
trf gather funds to enable him to get
nartit-d has led to his undoing:. His sal
ary was ?6G i>er month, and it is said
JhPt February last he has added
tii hii* Income to the extent of about
S^f 1 ?." Cf that amount he loaned to a
frieifd $200 at 5 per cent interest, and
â¢.he-'i-.Manre he deposited irom time to
thne In ih* Oakland Hank of Savings.
Burlng the hour that the assistant
cashier" was at lunch Jacobs took his
piabe. This, it is said, gave him the
opportunity to steal. When a customer
purchased goods he got an invoice from
the salesman, which he took to the
bill clerk. The bill clerk would make
out a bill and hand It and the invoice
to the customer, putting a duplicate
on his file. The customer would take
the invoice and bill to Jacobs, who re
ceipted the bill, retaining the cash and
destroying the invoice. He watched his
opportunity and also destroyed the du
plicate bill filed by the bill clerk.
Jacobs lived at 272 B street, Oakland,
smrl was looked upon as a young man
t3f promise, both by his employers and
friend*. The police say that he made
ti full confession.

Representatives of the United Rail
roads held a long conference yesterday
with Mayor Rchmitz relative to the
curve at Post and Kearny . streets,
which the Board of Public Works
caused to be torn up because it was
less than eleven feet from the side
walk. The result of the conference was
an agreement on the part of the com
pany to rearrange the curve so that
it will be eight feet from the curb line.
Although this will still be a violation
of the ordinance Mayor Schmitz was
of the opinion that it -was as much as
the company could be expected to do
in the oremiscs in view of the rights
which it clearly possesses.
The company contends that its fran
chise for this point was granted before
the passage of the ordinance and that
it is a mechanical impossibility to get
any such distance as" eleven feet on
streets' of the width of Kearny and
Post. There are no double track
curves in the city at that distance, but
the company finds it possible and is
willing to move its track south as far
ns practicable. This has been calculated
at the Hmlt of one foot and two inches,
which would increase the present dis
tance of five feet and two inches to six
feet and four inches." In addition to
this, for better security, it is proposed
that the curb at the northwest corner
of Post and Kearny streets shall be re
formed so as to gain one foot and eight
inches additional distance, making a
total distance of eight feet between the
rail and curb.
The company will at its own expense,
but under the supervision of the Board
of Public Works, reconstruct the curb
and repave the street at this point.
The rail is to be laid flatter and the
grade between rail and curb is to be
laid with less incline. The company,
however, will first obtain the .consent
and recommendation of the Board of
Public Works and secure action by the
Brard of Supervisors permitting the
change in the curb.
The company conceded that it acted
without right in laying the curved
track without flrEt obtaining a permit
from the Board of Public Works to
open the street for that purpose. Appli
cation, was made at the end of the
conference to the board for the permit.
A blueprint, showing the new arrange
ment, accompanied the application,
which will be referred to the City En
gineer for investigation and report.

Human hair
and how
to grow it
The hair of the head has
always been a source of
pride to both men and
women throughout all the
word's history and its loss
or deterioration is a source
of keen mortification
and regret.
Frorn time to time
various so-called remedies
for falling hair and the
various diseases of the
scalp have been foisted upon
t.hc public, and the failure
of these to do any perma-
nent good has only added
disappointment to discour-
agement
One remedy, however â
Coke Dandruff Cure â
lias proved itself capable
of doing everything
claimed for it and of being_
Morthy of the confidence of
a much-abused public.
It will remove dandrufi,
it will cure diseases of the
scalp, it will put new life
into the old follicles, and
consequently will actually
grow hair on a bald head.
An incredulous smile
may p2ss over the face
of the reader at the last
paragraph, but thousands
of testimonials on file in
our office prove it beyond
the shadow of a doubt, end

where he may be. will tell
you the same story..

For the Human Body in Health and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us tha early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us
our daily dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,
and mind you, this old-fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit.
Tho idea was good but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a single grain
Is far more effective than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
In drug stores under the name of
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. They are
small chocolate coated pellets and con-
lain the active medicinal principle of
pulphur In a highly concentrated, ef-
fective form. j
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
sulphur acts directly on the liver and
excretory organs, and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimin-
ation of- waste material.
Â¦ Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and molas-
ses every spring 1 and fall, but the cru-
dity and impurity of ordinary flowers of
sulphur were often worse than the dis-
ease, and cannot compare with the
modern concentrated preparations of
sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers are undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They axe the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
stipation ajid purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient andphysi-
cian alike.
Dr. II. M. "Wilkins while cxperlmenl-
ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or- malaria, I. have been sur-
prised, at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re-
peatedly seen them dry up and disap-
pear in four or five days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie-
tary article and sold by druggists, and
for that reason tabooed by many phy-
sicians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, Jiver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forms of Ekin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired" of
pills, cathartics and so-called -blood
"purifiers," will find in Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more pala-
table and effective preparation.

May Boyce said that the whisky she

From underneath a pile of lumber on
the Spear street wharf the human fer
rets dragged Charles Hartman, a com
paratively decent appearing man, and
they did. not believe his story that he
was a stranger in the city and had
sought shelter there because he had no
means of hiring a lodging.
"My only crime is poverty," he said
to Judge Mogan. "It was to get shelter
from the rain that I crept under the
lumber and tried to sleep. I had no
where else to go, for I am a stranger
in San Francisco and ha.ve no money.
If it is an offense to be dead broke and
homeless I am guilty. But that I am
"neither a loafer nor a thief I can
prove."
.He did prove it by showing certifi
cates that he worked as a laborer until
sickness incapacitated him for toll, and
he was forced to spend his savings for
medical service. Then the prosecuting
policeman sarcastically remarked that
for a stranger in the city the defend
ant showed surprising aptitude in find
ing a sleeping place much frequented
by vagrants.
"Your sarcasm is uncalled for," said
the Judge to the officer. "If this man
were versed in the ways of the city's
vagrants he would probably have se
lected a more desirable shelter from the
storm than was afforded him by a lot
of loose planks. He has proved that he
is not a professional vagabond, and as
this court' does not regard either his
unavoidable illness or resultant poverty
as a crime he is discharged. Every one
cannot escape adversity, you know, or
be a policeman."
They found Neil Gilman nestled amid
a heap of scrap iron upon the Folsom
street wharf, and he was so drunk that
he did riot know the rain was drenching
him. He will be sentenced to-morrow.
While the rainstorm was raging night
before last a posse of policemen toured
the wharves and scooped .in all va
grants whom they found under shelter.
Five chronic vagabonds were picked up
on the hay wharf, at .the foot of Third
street, and each of them explained that
he was a longshore laborer awaiting
cessation of the storm and turning of
the tide so that: he could resume work
on some ship â name of vessel not re
memberedâ which he had been helping
to unload the previous day. They were
given twenty-four ; hours* apiece by
Judge Mogan.

Henry C. Colch, 18 years of age, who
had confessed that he robbed telephone
cash boxes, blubbered for mercy. His
mother also tearfully appealed. for le
niency and offered to pay any fine the
court might impose. The youth was
fined $100 and the- woman promptly
handed the sum to the clerk of Judge
Mogan's tribunal. iJ^r '
Louis Perlno and Gustave Swant, 17
year-old lads, were sentenced to six
months' imprisonment by Judge Mogan
after they had pleaded guilty to the
charge of stealing liquors from a Pa
cific street saloon. They were booked
for grand larceny, and It was in ac
cordance with the Judgre's suggestion
that they pleaded guilty of petty lar
ceny. On account of their youth his
Honor did not want to send them to
the penitentiary via the Superior Court.
Having performed his street car act
last Friday evening until the initiated
spectators were weakened by laugh
ter and unable to applaud him any
more, Mr. Ryan varied his performance
by arming himself with a shoe-stretch
er and pursuing a Japanese boy who
happened to fall athwart iWs.ollne of
vision. The little brown lad was run
ning for his life and his pursuer was
uttering demoniac yells and brandish
ing his weapon when a policeman
stopped the chase by arresting the
chaser and coldly declining to enter
into the spirit of the joke. Judge Mo
gan also refused to regard the incident
as humorous when it was explained to
him by Mr. Ryan and several appre
ciative witnesses, and the consequence
is that Mr. Ryan awaits sentence for
disturbing the peace.
James Ryan, shoemaker at Sixth and
Natoma streets, is such a "cut-up"
when intoxicated that his neighbors
never think of going to witness a
funny stage performance when he is
on a spree. He furnishes them with
original amusement, and doesn't tax
them a cent for it. One of his side
splitting capers is to alarm the crews
and passengers of passing street cars
by pretending to cast himself under the
vehicles, eluding the wheels by the
narrowest possible margin compatible
with bodily safety. This specialty
never fails to win innumerable encores.
Its attractiveness is enhanced by the
fact that the performer has only one
foot. His crippled condition tends to
make his seemingly miraculous escape
from death all the more thrilling, be
cause it makes his ability to escape
appear impossible.
Henry Young and his wife positively
identified Charles Coulter as the man
wher robbed the former of a diamond
pin last Sunday afternoon on a Valen
cia street car and Frank Gomes and
Nathan Yineberg as positively swore
that at the time of the alleged robbery
Coulter was in San Jose.
Judge Cabaniss continued ' the case
till next Tuesday in order to give him
velf time to ponder over the direct con
flict of testimony. The Youngs testi
fied that Coulter stole the pin about 3
o'clock p. m. and Gomes and Yineberg
averred that Coulter was seen by them
in- the Garden City shortly after 2
o'clock p. m. on the same day. Gomes
keeps a lodging-house and Yineberg is
an old resident of San Jose.
Coulter has served two terms in San
Quentin and several months ago was
arrested for.' grand larceny. He was
.convicted and â¢ sentenced to "four years
by Superior. Judge.-. Lawlor, but ap
pealed to the Supreme Court and was
released on bail. The higher tribunal
sustained the lower Â¦tourt, but Coulter
did not give- himself up. He was ar
rested at Sah Jose last Tuesday for the
Young robbery. Even if his alibi should
stick he will be -held by theÂ»Sheriff un
til Judge Lawlor again sentences him.
Case continued till to-morrow, when
the defense will try to show that prior
to Mr. Garrett's voluntary retirement
from the dance hall he was twice
ejected by Mr. Lopez for disorderly
conduct.
James Garrett Jr., a gigantic negro,
described how his left arm was almost
amputated by a razor in the /hand of
Filisano Tores, a consumptive-appear
ing Porto Rican. It was in the Pacific
street dance hall owned and managed
by Dan Lopez that the trouble began
and the woman at the bottom of it
was the renowned Anastasia Johnson.
"Me an' de lady wuz eatin* pigsfeet

Garrett to Police Judge Mogan, "wen

The fact that there Is a deficit in the
Firemen's Pension Fund which has pre
vented the payment of the pensions for
June is causing considerable unfavor
able comment among those interested.
It is claimed on alleged legal grounds
that the Board of Supervisors in
neglecting to provide a sufficient appro
priation yearly to pay the pensions has
repeatedly violated the charter, which
makes it mandatory upon the board to
make the necessary provision for the
purpose. Section 2 chapter 7 of the
charter, under the caption of "Fire
men's Relief Fund," reads as follows:
"There shall be annually levied, col
lected and apportioned to the Firemen's
Relief Fund a tax sufficient to meet
and pay all demands upon said fund
for the purposes set out in this chap
ter."
The members of the Board of Fire
Pension Fund Commissioners charge
the Supervisors with having regularly,
every* year since the charter went into
effect, failed to allow enough money to
pay the pensions, despite the plain
provisions of the charter on the subject.
It is said that In accordance with the
charter provisions the Pension Com
missioners in June, 1903, asked the Su
pervisors to appropriate $26,000 for pen
sions, but $19,000 only was allowed for
1903-1904. This resulted in a deficit of
more than $4000, and for a time it was
thought that the pensions for May and
June would not be paid. The Fire Com
mission, however, came to the assist
ance of the pensioners and contributed
a sum saved in the salary account to
pay the May pensions. Section 7 of the
chapter mentioned provides as follows:
"The Pension Commissioners shall
make up an estimate of the amount re
quired to pay all demands on the Fire
men's Relief Fund for the succeeding
fiscal year and certify the same to the
Supervisors in connection with and as
part of. the annual appropriation of the
Fire Department."
Such an estimate has been regularly
filed with the Supervisors, but has been
invariably cut down, resulting in a de
ficit. The only expense attached to the
matter is the payment of $50 monthly
for a secretary and for printing. Should
there be a surplus In the fund it would
be carried over to the appropriation
for the following year. The Commis
sioners have about $500 available to pay
the June pensions, but are awaiting the
pleasure of the Supervisors* Finance
Committee to make up the balance of
about $1400.

Hotel, Turk and Leavenworth streets.

THE charge that Warden
Tompkins had abused the
use or the straitjacket at
San Quentin failed utterly
of substantiation at an investi
gation made by the board of
<Urcctors yesterday. Convict
Adam Stroh, who was said to
have been the victim of cruel
and Inhuman punishment, de
nied absolutely that undue suf
fering was inflicted on him.
He assured the board that his
health was not Impaired nor did
he afterward feel any ill effects
whatever from his experience of
being laced up for ninety-five
hours. That he deserved pun
ishment in a severe form, pos
session of a vial of morphine
being his offense, was frankly
admitted by, the prisoner.
The Warden and subordinate
officers were examined search-
Ingly and they nil testified that
as soon as Stroh was released
from the jacket he was able to
walk away, to take a bath and
to climb four flights of stairs
the next morning to the dun
geon. The inquiry developed
no evidence of cruelty wliatcver
in the management of the peni
tentiary, and the directors were
disgusted with their waste of
time over fake reports.

success. . The " nave of the church,

affair. The building was 'beautifully
lighted and on each side, between the
large pillars, , were placed, the booths,
loaded down with articles. for sale.
The: booths' were' all' in' charge of
pretty women, members of the parish,
and the articles for, sale were dainty
and quite reasonable. A separate
booth for, dispensing refreshments, was
a : feature- of the" evening and did a

nished â¢: by members of* the church
choir.
The proceeds of the..bazaar will go

In paying part of these claims. The
Dean Law and Collection agency had
in charge eight claims, handling
about $1500 of the defalcations on as
signments. Some creditors will not
receive anything, as all the money
represented by Weidler's bond has
been paid out.
Weidler's whereabouts may be
known to a few of his friends, but the
authorities have been unable to find
him. He. is said to have written re
cently to acquaintances in this city
that he is working in a northern State
for $1 a day, but expects soon to be
in Canada.
OAKLAND. Oct. 8. â Final settle

States Fidelity and Guarantee Com
pany of the claim of the county for
ex-Constable Edward Weidler's bond,
amounting to $2000. The last install
ment of this amount was paid into
Justice Quinn's court yesterday.
Weidler left this city four months
ago, having appropriated to his own
use money collected by him as Con
stable. Claims against him aggregat
ing thousands of dollars have been
filed by persons whose cases he han
dled and whose money he collected

Maguire was a striking example of
the need of the straitjacket. With the
obstinacy of a mule he refused to an
swer questions. He was in the jacket
for twenty-four hours and has since
been in the dungeon, but he is deter
mined not to work. His plea is Illness,
which the physician declares positively
to be a sham. He declared his side
bore marks of the straitjacket, but aa
examination revealed none. i ;â¢'-'.-

the very unsatisfactory lighting and
power servjse by the Bay Counties
Power Company. The lights dicker con
stantly, and freq>entlythe power cur
rent falls, compelli.\5 the Jute mill to
be shut down. The CSirectors have lost
patience with the corporation officials.
Felton and Wilkins were appointed a
committee to obtain estimates of the
cost of erecting an elec'.ri* plant at the
prison, with a view of providing an in
dependent supply.
The board has reason, to be discour
aged with the paroling It prisoners, for
eight men released on probation have
resumed their criminal careers. There
are fifty men out </n parole in the
State, hov.-ever, who are leading indus
trious and upright lives.

Harry Oppenheimer. murderer and
guilty of several assaults with knives
on prison guards and convicts, sent a
letter to the board, asking to be let out
of solitary confinement, to which he
has been subjected during the last five
years. No attention was paid to the
request. Oppenheimer Is vicious and
Warden Tompkins said It would be
dangerous to release him from the

PERSONAL.
Testimony was taken of. Warden
Tompkins, Dr. Philip Casey, Chief
Turnkey BertB. Swan, Lieutenant , of
the Guard D. J. Sullivan and Sergeant
J. H. Murray, but in no place could
the probe find any evidence of cruelty.
The Directors were very much in
earnest in the inquiry. Senator Felton,
as soon as it was opened, declared that
he wanted the allegations sifted to the
bottom ' and â¢ Messrs. . Fitzgerald, Ray
and Devlin expressed themselves like
wise. The end -filled them with dis
gusts They simply dropped the whole
matter without formal action and went
on to other business. â¢
Not only was valuable time wasted
by the Directors in .investigating
charges that . had no basis of fabric,
but a serious step had been .unwitting
ly taken toward demoralization of dis
cipline in the penitentiary. Convicts
will go to any bounds if they think
they can cause unpleasantness through
newspaper and other criticisms for
those who guard and rule them behind
the bars and walls.' '. . ' : , i<
\ The board convened at- the prison at
10 a. m. and did not finish its work till
5 p. m. President Fitzgerald was on
hand, notwithstanding: his letter to
Governor Pardee that he could attend
no more sessions and that his succes
sorrnust be . appointed at . once. The
accusation that Tompkins was ruling
Stroh thought that Warden Tomp
kins ought to believe his story as to
how he obtained the'drugâ that it was
given him by an outgoing "prisoner.
He insisted that this was the truth
after he was in the straitjacket for
ninety-five hours, and did so still when
before the board yesterday. The Di
rectors did not give him credence, how
ever, and it was apparent that Stroh
was upholding the rigid . convict law
never, to disclose the channel of drug
supply through- the prison walls.
. WASTE OF TIME*
Reports that cruel use of the strait-
Jacket was being made at the San
Quentin prison were investigated by
the Board of Directors yesterday and
found to be absolutely without found
ation.
Adam Stroh, a burglar convict from
this city, who was alleged to have been
the victim of treatment that almost
caused his death,- testified that, out
side the usual discomfiture and mental
angvish, the only pain he suffered was
from cramps of the stomach, and this
only for a 'period of twenty minutes..
He admitted having in his possession
a vial of morphine, and. told the Di
rectors that he deserved punishment
for the serious infraction of the rules,
lie said that no permanent ill resulted
from his experience in the jacket.
When asked if he had any complaint
to make the prisoner answered that he
had norKSsatid further assured the Di
rectors that it was absolutely neces
sary to have some form of severe pun
ishment to hold out to convicts in or
der to maintain discipline among
them.
Felton and Wilkins were delegated
to invesUsate the officers' quarters and
the- requests for other small improve
ments at San Quentin. ."â¢ â¢ â¢ -
"Those- officers' quarters are a
shame and a disgrace," commented
Fitzgerald...
"Yes, they are, and something ought
to be done right away to improve
gency." Â¦
Commissioner Felton again gave em
phatic indorsement to the report of the
Public Charities and' Reform Board,
and Devlin was delegated to prepare a
statement forthwith of the situation,
outlining the needed improvements for
presentation* to Governor Pardee and
for- the enlightenment of the Legisla
ture. ,. â¢ - ' â¢'â¢
"The men whom we employ to guard
the prison receive no more than $50
a month and board, and it is utterly
impossible to get the kind of men we
ought to have in those very respon
sible positions. Something must be
done to help out the penitentiaries, and
I cannot speak too forcibly, of the ur-
"Owing to lack of funds the institu
tions are dependent on the men whom
it is our aim to confine and punish.
Even our telegraph operator here is a
convict, and the messages concerning
the affairs of the prison pass through
his hands.
CONVICTS IX POWER.
The rrlost important business trans
acted at the meeting was a vigcrrous
indorsement of the recent report of the
State Charities and Correction Board,,
in which the deplorable conditions at
California's two penal Institutions, re
sulting from the parsimonious course
c-f the State, was forcibly brought" to
public attention.
Felton suggested that the board
should malce- a report to tne Uovernor
and the Legislature, setting forth the
improvements urgently needed, in the
prisons. President Fitzgerald here
spoke up.
"Unless there is a change in the ap
propriation of funds," he said, "and
If "no -more liberality is shown the pen
itentiaries, the conditions of maintain
ing them will certainly be discourag
ing. The situation now is deplorable,
and the State simply must set aside
money to relieve It. We have to keep
five or six men in some cells. With
our woeful lack of room it is absolutely
impossible to segregate the hardened
criminals from those for whom there
is hope of reform.
"All the books of the prisons are
kept by convicts, and we must trust
them with our most important affairs.
They might falsify or destroy records
and cause the most serious complica
tions. Those connected with the man
agement of the penitentiaries arc sit
ting on volcanoes. They could easily
be entangled at any time in charges of
mismanagement and wrongful acts.
with . unwarranted severity, however,
brought the Director away from his
office for the day.
PRISONS ARK CRIPPLED.
With a heavy knotted cane held over
her head by a husband who she
feared would kill her, Mrs. Jennie Low
enthal, wife of H. H. Lowenthal, the/
attorney, was compelled, she says, to
deed all of her property to him. A
month later the . Superior Court de
clared Lowenthal ' incompetent and J.
Bernhard was appointed his guardian.
Yesterday Mrs. Lowenthal began suit
to have the deed set aside. She says
that s.hs signed . the document under
duress and menace, against her will
and without consideration. -
Her husband, according to the com
plaint, v*as mentally incompetent and
acting under insane delusions. He
presented a blank form of deed for her
to sign and, holding the cane over her
head, threatened to kill her if she did
not do his will. She declares that he
was in the habit of carrying a loaded
revolver, and she feared that he then
had the weapon in his -pocket and
would use it. Although \signing the
deed she says she did not appear be
fore . the notary, and the purported
acknowledgement Is not correct-
Airs. Lowenthal alleges that the

They say, however, that. the present
rain cloud is the largest in existence
and hovers over the entire Pacific slope
from the Rockies to the Pacific Ocean
and from the Mexican line to the north
as far as weather reports are obtain
able. Only one little section of this
vast area is unvisited by the downpour
and that is Arizona and a portion of
New Mexico. These Territories, how
ever, have had their share of heavy
rains during the summer.
The rain clouds above are almost Im
movable and there is no promise of a
high wind to drive them away. Thun
derstorms have visited Red Bluff, Sac
ramento and Fresno. The Weather
Bureau does not expect to hear of any
great loss at those places, as its warn
ing bulletins were posted twenty-four
hours in advance of the storms. There
ia a strong southwest wind developing
in Southwestern Utah, but it is pre
dicted that its force will be spent be
fore reaching California!
The rainfall yesterday was .54 of an
inch, a slight increase over Friday's
precipitation.
It is almost useless for the citizens of
San Francisco to appeal to the Weath
er Bureau for relief from the rains.
The only encouragement given out at
weather headquarters is the fact that
the conditions are abnormal. It might
be assumed from this that a snow
storm is in order, but the Weather Bu
reau officials will not go" this far in
their prediction.

NEW YORK. Oct S. â George Arents
Jr., a New York millionaire, lies dy
ing at a hospital in Long Island, and
his chauffeur, Carl Meusel, is dead as
a result of the automobile race for the
cup offered by William K. Vander
bilt Jr.
Arents' car was wrecked by tires
slipping. The chauffeur was taken to a
hospital, horribly mangled, where he
died half an hour later. Arents was
also taken to the hospital, where It was
found he was suffering' from a cerebral
hemorrhage, and at an early hour to
day he was not expected to live.
His family has been summoned to
his bedside.
The committee considering the pro
test lodged by M. Clement disallowed
the protest at an early hour this morn
ing:. Heath, who finished first, was
declared the winner.
The official time was given out as
follows:
Elapsed Correrted
N*uie. Time. Time.
HÂ«Â«th ti:f)6:45 5:98:45
Clement 6:58:13 5:2S:13
No time was taken for the other con
testants.
The- story of the race itself is one
of intense excitement and nerve-ten
sion. After running for seven hours,
sometimes at a speed of sixty to nine
ty miles an hour, faster than many
express trails, George Heath, an
American, driving a ninety horsepower
vehicle of foreign make aSid repre
senting the Automobile Club of
France, finished first in the run of
COO miles, with Albert Clement, repre
senting the same dub and driving an
eighty horsepower machine, also of
foreign make, one minute and twenty
eight seconds behind him.
CLEMENT ILNTEIIS PROTEST.
When the two men flashed by the
judges' stand the crowds' in the grand-
Ktands rose in a body and cheered, re
lieving the tension of nerves that held
the crowd for eo many hours. Clement
in a protest declared that he had been
held up in Kempstead over a minute
and a half and that if this had been
allowed him he would have won the
race. He said that his gasoline tank
broke in Hempstead and that time was
taken on him while he was repairing
it, contrary to the conditions of the
race. He also asserted that his time in
control had been charged against him.
Like all previous races of the kind,
there was a chapter of accidents and a
fatality. The victims were among par
ticipants ;n the contest. Fortunately,
none of the spectators along the course
were hurt.
The man killed was Carl Meusel, a
chauffeur, who was driving the car of
George Arents of New York. The ac- !
c-ident was caused by the tires slipping j
and it occurred about 8 o'clock/ two
hours after the start. The car was
traveling at a tremendous rate and was
approaching a curve when it suddenly
swerved and turned over. Meusel was
caught beneath the machine, while
Arents was thrc-wn to one side. Both
men were taken to a hospital, where
ilcusel died half an hour later. Arents*
car was demolished.
The race was started at 6 o'clock. The
course was over a thirty-mile triangle,
with turns that were sharp and dan
gerous. At two places the railroad
crossed the highway at grade and
these places were guarded by signal"
men. Twice at these crossings Gabriel,
ci French motorist, narrowly missed
being struck by a train, in one in
stance running but two feet ahead of
a. locomotive. The starters in the race

\V. C. Storek the secretary of the
Leather Workers' Union, who was re
ported to the police as missing, has
turned up safe and sound. He did
not run away with the funds of the
union, as some supposed, nor was he
kidnaped by emissaries of the .Citi
zens' Alliance, as others hinted. Â¦ He
simply had a severe tumble from his
perch on the water, wagon, imbibed
too freely with strangers, engaged in
a poker game and lost not only his
own money but some of the funds of
the union as well. He appeared at
the headquarters of the union yester
day a sadder but wiser man.
According to his story, Storek left
the headquarters of the union at 927
Mission street about midnight Thurs
day and went to the corner of Fifth
and Market streets to catch a car. He
had in his possession the books of the
union and $325 belonging to the or
ganization, which he had expected to
use in paying strike benefits. While
standing on the corner he was ap
proached by a glib stranger and after
the two had had several drinks to
gether a third person was introduced
and a quiet game of cards proposed.
The men seemed to be such good
fellows' that Storek was thrown com
pletely off his guard and readily con
sented to take chances of winning or
losing a few dollars. The trio went to
a gambling house , on, O'Farrell street
and played poker. > Storek lost all his
own money and then began to draw
from the funds of the union. The
game seemed so one-sided that his
suspicions were aroused and he - quit
the party, only to sit down at another
table with "other strangers/* "When^ne
finally 1 quit the game he was. out about
$235. He promises to refund 1 to the
union all the money he lost.
After quitting the game Storek did
not at once go home, but took a : room
in a downtown' hotel. His- mother,
alarmed at his unusuaL absence, noti
fied the police and the Coroner.
Storek gave an excellent description
of his companions to the police and
yesterday afternoon Harry Walters, a
well-known bunko man, was arrested
by Detectives Ryan and Taylor and his
name placed on the detinue book at
the city prison.

Heath continued to lead until the
eighth lap, when he was delayed by
trouble with his tire, and Clement
passed him. At the 150-mile point, at
the end of the fifth round, the standing
was: Heath first, Gabriel second, Clem
ent third, Lytttle fourth, Teste fifth.
Heath's average speed in the first half
was sixty-three miles an hour.
Heath after the delay finished his
eighth lap and entered on the ninth at
terrific speed. Clement, who started
later than Heath, was now three min
utes in the lead, official time. The ex
citement in the grand stand began to
increase. Clement had only a lead of
one minute and forty-eight seconds en
tering the last lap, according- to the of
ficial announcement. Heath had gained
a minute on him, but it did not seem
that he would wipe out the two min
utes remaining.

The official elapsed time for the en

'"The machine owned by E. R. Thomas
and driven by Hawley while making
one of the turns swerved from the road,
ran upon grass along the road and
narrowly missed crashing into a tree.
Spectators were panic-stricken, but the
danger soon passed. Later the Thomas
machine broke down and retired from
the race.
Frank Croker's daring driving was a
feature that brought spectators to their
feet. After the fourth time around the
thirty-mile triangle, however, his ma
chine had sustained injuries that put it
out of the running.
There was a continuous bursting of
tires at one point in the course that
aroused suspicion- Investigation show
ed that a quantity of sharp nails and
broken glass had been thrown on the
roadway. To this cause was due the
retirement of a number of the ma
chines early in the race.
Of the eighteen starters but eight
remained in the race at the fifth round
of the triangle, or when the race was
half over.
Heath covered the last lap of thirty
miles at the rate of 7: miles an hour.
His average speed during the ten laps
was 52 miles an hour.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 8.
In a close, hard game, where every
foot of ground was disputed by twen
ty-two trained pieces of fighting ma
chinery, the Sherman Indian football
team to-day succeeded in bruising its
way over the goal line during the last
four minutes' play of the second half,
thereby making the only, score of the
day and administering a clean defeat
to Stanford's trained eleven.
Fullback Williams was a source of
tremendous strength to the Indians.
It was his determined fa'ce that was
at the bottom of every pile, his de
fensive work being nothing short of
marvelous. Just at the close of play
he suffered a severe injury, tearing the
ligaments above the elbow of his left
arm. Payne, the Indian halfback,
came out with a sprained shoulder.
No other player was seriously hurt.
The line-up of the two teams follows:

Coach Lanagan was disappointed at

had rained all Friday night and the

PRINCETON, Nv J.. Oct. 8.â The best
defense Princeton has met yet was en
countered in the Washington and Jef-
The college boys had little difficulty
in getting through for their second
touchdown. Smock kicked forty yards
and Heitmuller sent the ball back to
the center on a return punt. The vis
itors made two ineffectual Jabs at the
line and :Â»unted thirty-five yards.
Kern caught the ball and- ran it back
eighteen yards before he was downed.
White pained five yards around right
end and then California was penalized
for holdlnjr. Booth tried a quarter

into easy goirig after making ten
yards, when Smock Â«rot around a good
interference and slammed his man to

The standard bearers of the blue and
gold christened the University of Call

terday by trimming "Pete" Smith's ag
gregation of past masters to the tune
of 10 to 0. The Olympics lost their
reet in the first half, but steadied
down splendidly after the recess.
Barring a few bad fumbles It was a
t}ne game of football. California
showed up well at Arst, but the men
seemed to lose some spirit after fifteen
minutes of play.- The field was In ex
cfllent condition, in spite of the rain,
and the ball wos not too slippery to
handle at any stage of the game. The
backs did more brilliant work than the
lines yesterday and the contest was
correspondingly more spectacular. The
Olympic boys seem to- be of the opin
ion that Stanford and California are
about on a par at present, and this
promlsc-s well for the big game.
It was Olympic's kickoff, and Smock
Bent the ball fifty yards to White, wh'Â»
ran it back fifteen. California punted
a return over the fullback's head, and
when SlaUer grasped the pigskin Henry
nail?d him In his tracks. Olympic
failed to connect with the necessary
live yards and it was California's ball
<^n downs. Kern made a yard -through
left tackle, Lassater bucked the cen
ter for six and White drove into the
line for two more. The ball was close
to Olympic's twenty-yard line, and the
spectators commenced to awaken. .
White covered seven yards on a tan
dem through right tackle. Then Las

for steady gains, until the last named
was sent over for a touchdown. The
trick took Just seven minutes. Force

penalized three times during the sec-,

AN EXCITING INCIDENT OF THE FOOTBALL GAME AT BERKELEY YESTERDAY BETWEEN THE COLLEGIANS AND THE OLYMPIC ELEVEN.
The endurance run proposed to be
held by the Automobile Club of Cali
fornia has been declared off for the
present. L. P. Lowe, chairman of -the
executive committee of the Automo
bile Club of California, has issued a
communication to the members. In
which he states that his circular let
ter calling for entries for the San
Francisco to Los Angeles endurance
run and tour set to start on the 12th
instant elicited many replies. Enough
members to make the run successful
expressed their intention of gom?, but
most of those willing to take part In
the contest prefer that it be "held at
a later time. The principal reason
for this is the wish of the dealers to
enter cars of the most recent models.
From consideration for the wishes
of the majority, the executive commit
tee has decided to postpone the event
until next spring.
Several members of the Automobile
Club of California, among 1 theni being
George P. Fuller, whose Pope-Toleflo
car won nearly all the open races at
the Del Monte tournament, have stat
ed their intention of entering their
cars in the races to be held at Los

W. Va., Hay 28, 1903.
Some years ago irhile at work, I fell
over a truck and severely injured both
of ay shins. My blood became poisoned
as 3 result, and the doctor told me I
would have running sores for life, and
that if they were healed up the result
would be fatal. Under this discouraging
report I left off their treatment and re-
ported to the use of S. S. S. Its effects
were prompt and gratifrine. It took
only a 6hort while for the "medicine to en-
tirely cure up the wares, and I am not
dead as the doctors intimated, nor have
the sores ever broke out again. Some la
years have elapsed since wliat I have de-
scribed occurred. Having been so signally
benefittedby its use I can heartily recom-
mend it as the one great blood purifier.

Chronic sores start often from a pim-
ple, scratch, bruise or boil, and while
salves, washes aad powders are beneficial,
the unhealthy matter in the blood must
be driven out or the sore will continue
to eat and spread. S. S. S. reaches
these old sores through the blood, re-
moves all impurities and poisons, builds
up the entire system and strengthens
the circulation. S. S. S. is a blood
purifier and tonic combined. Contains

BOSTON, Oct. 8.â By winning two
games to-day the Boston Americans
regained the lead New York had taken
from them yesterday. Before 28,040 per
sons Boston took the first game by a
score of 13 to 2,Â»with Chesbro in the
box for the first four innings and
Clarkson for the other five. The score
of the second game was 1 to 0.
Chesbro did strong work for three
innings In the first game, during- which
time only one of the locals reached
first base, getting there on a base on
balls. In the fourth Hoston began a
batting spell that lasted, for the re
mainder of the game. Clarkson, who
went to pitch in the fifth, was both
wild and ineffective, allowing two runs
in the sixth inning and another in the
seventh. It was an cas'y one-sided. win
for Boston.
"Cy" Young did not give a base on
balls in the second game. Young
pitched against Powell. The game was
called at the end of tne seventh inn
ing, on account of darkness. New York
had plenty of chances to score in the
early innings. They had two men on
bases and but one out in each of the
first two innings, but failed to score.
Three times in the game the first
man to bat reached his base safely.
He got no further. Boston won the
game in the fifth inning by scoring one
run on Ferris' infield single to Wil
liams; Criger's sacrifice, an out and
Conroy's failure to stop Anderson's
throw at third. Score: ' *
Others noted about the grounds were;
Messrs. August Belmont. James R.
Keene, John W. Gates, John A. Drake
and hundreds of the best known regu
lars ivho frequent the clubhouse. In
terest in the sport was keen and there
Â»aE much regret expressed that both
Â«lafsic stakes of the day should have
furnished so much food for criticism
on account of the more than usual
amount erf foul riding. It was the opin
ion of hundreds who saw the incidents
connected with both Pasadena's and
Gunfire's victories, in their respective
laces, that the riders took little or no
pains to avert interference with con
tending horses, yet no disqualifications
(allowed. Summary:

MORRIS PARK, Oct. 8.â Judging
from the crowded clubhouse, grand
tiand and lleldrtand, racing did not
suffer any appreciable loss by the at
tractions of the automobile race to-day
on Long Inland. Every prominent turf
inaxi was on hand. Including W. K.
Vanderbilt. who recently returned from
a successful season on the French turf.
Vanderbilt was especially inlerested in
Gunfire, winner of the Municipal han
dicap- He spent some minutes in her
stall while J. \V. Rogers was saddling
the mare.
h;Â»cc;aJ Dispatch to The Call
CHICAGO, Oct. S.â Miss Crawford,
with Nicol in the saddle, and at 6 to -1
in the betting, won the Liberty han
| dicap at Worth to-day after a spec
tacular drive through the stretch with
Fossil, which she beat three parts of a
length. Brancas was third, four
lengths away. Starter Murray's work
in thte race was miserable. Reserva
tion and Port Royal, both heavily
| backed by the spectators, were left
standing at the post. The others, save
I for three or four, were sent off strag
gling.
Fossil showed the way to the
stretch^ where he was joined by Miss
Crawford. The latter, under a fine ride
by Nicol, wore the California crack
down in a hard drive through the last
.furlong. . ,
The fifth race went to Major Mansir
in a nose finish with Little Elkin. Me-
Intyre. who rode Elkln. claimed a foul
against Nicol on the Major, but the
claim was not allowed by the Judges.
Nicol rode four winners.. A large
crowd witnessed the races. The
weather was warm and balmv. The
track had dried out wonderfully since
yesterday and was good, verging on
fast by the time the handicap was run.

case of defeat. After a deal of arguing
it was finally agreed that both men de
posit with Harry Corbett the sum of
$2500 within ten days before the date
of the battle, $1500 as a weight guaran
tee and 51000 for appearance. Coffroth
Â¦will also deposit $1000 as a guarantee
that the battle will be held.
It took an hour and a half to arrange
the final details, though everything
was practically mapped out before the
meetinvr was called to order. .Britt
wanted a substantial weight forfeit, ex
plaining that much depended on the
title. He insisted on J2500, but Her
ford thought $1000 sufficient. After
much talk they finally agreed on $1500.
The referee for the match will be
named within ten days ,of the match.
Herford seemed much disturbed/on this
question and hinted at some good men
from the other side of the Rockies.
Britt would hear nothing line that. He
insisted the third man in the ring
should be some Californian whom he
knew and trusted. After another gentlt
wrangle thÂ£ Interested parties agreed
to postpone the naming of the official
to a later d;ite.'
Coffroth talked as though he had the
permit for the fight in his vest pocket.
When Herford asked. where the mill
Â¦was to be decided Coffroth answerrd,
"San Francisco." It was then agreed
that if the fight could not be held in
this city the articles would be null and
void. Coffroth and Herford held a con
sultation in the afternoon regarding
the permit and both felt assured it
would be granted.- .
Nothing was sajd about Colma, so it
looks ihat place would-be abandoned.
It may be possible that in the event of
Coffroth's inability to secure a permit
in this city another meeting will be
held and articles for a match in Colma
will be drawin up.
When the details of the match were
settled Herford wanted a clause in
serted whereby Britt agrees to give
Gans the next match should the pres
ent one fall through. Jimmy would
not consent. He admitted that the
Corbett bee was buzzing in his sky
piece and told Herford he would agree
to meet Gans after Young Corbett, in
the event of the present match slip
ping. Following is a 'copy of the ar
ticles of agreement as signed by Het
ford. Eritt and Coffroth:

COFFEE â C.-E. .Blckford's circular gtvea the
receipts at this port since. January 1 at 200.054
bags, against 235,734 during the same time last
year. The sales from first hands were 175O.JS
bags, against 220.436. The stock In first- hands
October 1 was 45,854 bags, against 09,000 last
year. The world's vlslblj supply October 1 was
14.2U0.40.S bags, against .13,770,420 last year.
The circular says: .. .
"September business has been disappointing.
The brisk autumn trade almost invariably en
countered and met has bsen noticeably absent
and It Is hard to account satisfactorily for
the lapse. As mocks In second hands were
known to , bo but moderately full. | we may
assume that 'Invisible' supplies were larger
than imagined and that prolonged hot weather
possibly influenced consumption more than
usual.
"At this writing the local market Is still
heavy, and listless and all grades arc cheaper
without attracting attention beyond small trad,
ing. Washed Coffees have been -more affected
than othsr descriptions, especially the higher
priced sorts, which latter have taken a decid
edly weaker turn.* .Â¦ - .
"The feature of Brazilian news has been the
large receipts at ' the ports â folly expected,
however, so far -as concerned the month of Sep
tember â and tha ! consequent increase ln* the
world's visible supply on October 1 of 774,000
bags, making the total visible supply 14,2eÂ«.00O
bass, or larger by 347,000 than the former
; high point of Ne\-embcr 1, lOOUi < , -
. "The immediate situation would appear to be
govÂ«rned by the extent of October receipts In
I Brazil and .the attitude of consuming countries
with- reference to buying. - ; Frcst cables and
incidentals are temporarily discarded by the
trade in general as having now no further sig
nificance- for or against the coming crop pend
ing the result of the final or December ilower
inc . which w-!U more .definitely determine-- the
future of Coffee.

SUM3IARY OF THE MARKETS.
present prices In the face of the continued
large receipts) and slacking demand for wheat
and flour. We are still of that: view. We
think' It should become. in mlj&d, however,
that the- crop news-fromÂ» Argentina, more, par
ticularly- Is the most Important item, not only
in Europe but here as well. The whole situa
tion of the world's consumption of wheat and
its supply is an unusually acute one. Briefly,
that situation could not well endure any great
loss to the Argentine crop. The conditions
have been favorable up to this time, the crop
large and the prospect- has been for a record
breaking crop. The Importing countries will
need this crop and need It very much. There
fore we say it should be kept in mind that
anything distinctly unfavorable to the Ar
gentine wheat crop will likely be a firebrand
applied to all the markets of the world."
In this market futures were l*4c higher- In
aympathy with New York -and Liverpool, but
trading was not large. The cash grain show

not purchasing as freely as they usually do
on Saturday. Changes in prices however
were slight and strictly fancy offerings of all

I fruit 50c was about the top. Thp other tree
fruits sto'od about as previously quoted with
supplies of all descriptions well up to re
quirements. Prices of some varieties of table
. Grapes In small packages wera a little lower
owing to the lack of demand for shlpuir.jt
but the market was In better shape than at
any time during the pan week, offerings of
old and wet stock being less liberal than pre
viously. The market was steady ,- for open
boxes, particularly for the' Muscat variety*
thÂ»j bent lots of Vwhlch readily commanded the
top quotation. Receipts of Wine Grapes were
light and prices of good stock .were well main

a slight advance, but there was plenty of or

THE" SAN' FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9. 1904.
SAYS CONDUCTOR KEPT CASH.-Da.vld
lounsr Jr.. division superintendent tor the
United Kallroads. obtained a warrant from
Police Judge Cabaniss yesterday for the ar
raignment of J. E. McLeiaUr, a conductor on
the Fillmore-street line, on a ciiarge of mis
demeanor embezzlement. It Is alleged that
McLeJster failed to turn ln $32 8w which ha
had collected on Friday for fares.
She lost her balance and fell. The
child's head struck a bookcase on the
first floor that inflicted a deep gash
Dr. Perlenky was called and on his
advice the child was removed to the
Children's Hospital.
The stockholders .in the White
Swan .Mines Company, or some of
them, are going to take a hand in the
litigation already involving the corpo
ration, its officers and promoters. The
suit begun yesterday names Horatio
Adams and 160 others, owners of 168,
713 shares of the company's stock,
who ask for an injunction to pre
vent the sale on October 15 of their
holdings for delinquent assessments.
They allege that their certificates
are "fully paid and non-assessable";
that the assessment of 5 cents a share
levied on June 21 is invalid because
the directors and the secretary who
called the alleged meeting at which
the levy was made were not legally
elected; that the debts of the mine are
not more than $5000, while the as
sessment ig for $56,160 30.
They say, too, that the assessment
is in furtherance of a scheme of J. N.
Woodward, former secretary, to have
the delinquent stock purchased by the
company. The complaint declares that
Major L. N. Lykke and C. H. Stuller
were not legally elected directors nor
the owners of. the certificates of stock
claimed by them. The matter. of the
forced resignation of Letson Balliet as
president and K. G. Shea as asisstant
secretary is again recited.

"respectable" lodging-house and for
the reimbursement of $1200 paid for
furniture and a' leasehold, which in
no manner .came up to the represen

the recovery of $950 and $500 puni
tive damages is directed against Bri
getta Seitz, former lessee of 62 Ellis
street and H. C. Decker, a lodging
house broker-
She charges them with fraud, deceit,
censpiracy and other things. She was
to have the furniture . and a seven
years' lease for the $1200, which/she
says, she paid on .January' 23. : The
furniture, she avers, is not worth more
than $250. The Â¦ profit -of' $120'. prom
ised by them. turned out to be a loss,
