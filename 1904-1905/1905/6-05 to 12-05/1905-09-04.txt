MUTSUHITO. â
OYSTER BAY. X. V.. Sept. 3.âPresi
dent Roosevelt to-day received at 12:40
o'clock from the Emperor of Japan
warm thanks for ills "disinterested and
unremitting efforts in the interests of
peace and humanity," and an expres
sion of the Japanese Emperor's "grate
ful appreciation of the distinguished
part" the President has taken in the
establishment of peace in the Far East.
Â£iie cablegram, which was received
from the Emperor personally, j follows:
TOKIO, Sept. 3. â The President: "I
have received with gratification your
message of congratulations, conveyed
through our plenipotentiaries, and
thank you w/irmly for it. To your dis
interested and unremitting efforts in
the interests of peace and humanity, I
attach the high value which is â¢ their
due and assure you of my grateful ap
preciation of the distinguished part
you have taken in the establishment
of peace based. upon principles essen
tial ToThe permanent' welfare and trari
quillly of the FaFEast.
"MUTSUHITO."
The cablegram - from the Japanese
Emperor puts an end to the rumors
that the Emperor was dissatisfied with
the terms finally concluded "by his plen
ipbtentiaries with those of the Em
peror of Russia. He accords President
Roosevelt full credit for the part he
took in bringing about peace "upon
principles essential to the permanent
welfare and tranquillity of the Far
East."
The concluding sentence of the ca
blegram is especially significant. It
'evidently -voievs the belief of the Jap^
anese Emperor that the treaty about
to be concluded at Portsmouth will be
for a permanent peace.
It can be said that the President
expressed no anxiety at the delay of
the cablegram 'from the Emperor of
Japan.' It was known x here that the
terms finally concluded at Portsmouth
were dictated by the Japanese Em
peror himself and that they could not
be otherwise than satisfactory to him
and his advisers. The delay in re
sponding to the Japanese plenipoten
tiaries was due, it Is suggested, to the
desire of the Emperor to be assured
that the terms agreed upon would be
Incorporated into a treaty without the
probability of a serious hitch. That
assurance, 5t is said, was conveyed to
the Japanese Emperor last night upon
the practical conclusion of the draft
of the treaty. The cablegram to Presi
dent Roosevelt to-day followed in
natural course.
Information reaching the President
to-day from Portsmouth indicates that
the treaty will be concluded formally
and signed early this week, probably
to-morrow or Tuesday. The substance
of the treaty is being reduced to en
grossed form, In two texts, English and
French. As soon as this formality
shall have been completed the conven
tion will be signed *~ the plenipo
tentiaries of the two Governments di
rectly in interest and will pass into
history as the "treaty of Portsmouth."'
BL'SSIA'S FUTURE POLICY.
Journ.-.liM ShOTiM the Â»ed of nn In
denttandlns With EnÃlnnd.
PORTSMOUTH, ft. H., Sept. 3.âAlexan
der Briantchinonoff, correspondent of the
St. Petersburfe' Slovo, writing regarding
the future policy of Russia, says:
It is an axiom that a ercat country cannot
consider its frontiers as dcliniteiy fixed until
its provinces have obtained free and unob
structed access to The sea. Germany has her
ports on the North Sea; England the Atlantic
Ocean; France the Atlantic and Mediter
ranean, while the United States, flanked by
two oceanE, is in a better position' than any
European country and for this reason must
certainly in the near future play a great role
in the world's politics.
liuEsla. owing to this unfortunate and re
sretiable war and to the conditions on ; which
peace have been obtained from ' Japan, loses
her absolute preponderance in the Far \u25a0 East.
but it is to be hoped that ehe will realize
that it would be unwise to recommence the
badly begun adventure . in Jlaachurta. She
n-iil have to be satisfied to . regain through
commerce what she has lost through the army.
Vladivostok, frozen for months every year,
v.ith Japanese sentinels all around ber, can
not have a sufficient political value to coun
terbalance Japanese ambition, Â»j that a.
U s.r.k understanding between Japan and - Rus
sia is necewary in oMcr that the two coun
tries shall be 6ure of eaclÂ» other's good ' faith.
The maintenance of Chinese integrity certain
2y enters into this programme and it Is only
through peace being insured in the Far Hast
that Russia can be -free to confine ber activi
ties to the European - stage, where her pres
ence will scon become Indispensable.
No matter what - the future of the control
of the gateway to the Baltic may be, that sea
will never be for Russia anything but a sea
closed by ice. So U Is natural . for Russia
Boocer or ; later to begin again her efforts : to
gain an open \u25a0 port to the southward. To at
tain this object 'there 'are only two ways; the
Persian Gulf. and the Bosphorus. The first is
the easier. - Persia being In a state of disin
tegration, while v the ..' lndian \u25a0' army, although
quite capable . of - defending- India, is not *in a
position to go to the defense of. Persia. Ger
many would certainly, belp Russia's schemes
in the Persian Gulf if she were left free in the
Bosphorus, while if Russia tried to reach 'the
BoK)>horus ehe would have to facs German'op
position and fight Turkey, which is much
The San Francisco Call.
stronger than Persia. Kngland at 'most would
remain iiassive. â¢ . . . '
Still, the conquest of the Bosphorus would, bt
the best Russia could do, as to reach the Per
sian Gulf would necessitate forcing a way sev
eral thousand milesâ it would not be dissimi
lar to the lndsx which- took her to -Port Ar
thur. She would advance between two rivals.
On the other hand. If she directed her efforts
toward the Cosphorus and offeriJ some.facili
ties to Kngland In the couth of Persia, she
could be' tranquil. She would be in a position
to protect the Slav cause against German in
fluence, which is growing every day. She
would prevent Germany from being paramount
in Europe. ..... ...
Finally, thera Is another reason for which It
Is time that Russia should understand that she
tsust rely on -England and not on Germany.
Germany is the. power or io-day.an<l Is put-j
ting forward every effort to make" Knsland the
t power of yesterday and prevent* the rising of
j the power of . to-morrow â Russlat at. the. head
of a great Slav confederation. France, which
Is undoubtedly: the power of .' yesterday, has
realised that and has eti-.ered' into an under-
standing with -England, while still" an. ally of

If. on the contrary, a quadruple 'understand-,
ing could be reached between 'the two dual al
liances," France and â¢ Russia on . one side anil
England and Japan on the other, haying as an
object the protection oftbelr Asiatic. African'
and Australian possessions, Russia-mighticasi
ly reach her object on the Bosphorus and sup
port Italy and ths Slavs when the inevitable
question of the Austrian succession arises.- 'In
this way the threatening imperialism' of Ger-.
many would be "quenched -and' the European
equllibruim would be . safeguarded, a thing
which is ' necessary for the Influence with the
United States in the Pacsflc.
However. . to be able to direct the Russian
politics to these far distant, but natural and
possible, alms It Is necessary first to clear the
Russian Foreign ! Office -of German traditions
and personnel and have true diplomats like De
\u25a0\Vittfl and not clerk diplomatists in charge of
Russia's foreign policy, all of which "will 'be
more. difficult than was the conclusion of peace
with Japan. .

Peace for Their Sake.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 3.â The
Emperor on Friday last telegraphed
the following to General Llnevitch:
The negotiations at Portsmouth led on
August 10 to a refusal of. the demands of the
Japanese Government regarding the cession of
the - island of SaghalJen. - the payment of a
war indemnity, the surrender of our ships
lying In neutral harbors and the limitation of
our forces 'in the waters of the Vac;nc ocean.
After further negotiations ~ Japan." on August
29, yielded all our conditions, but asked. lor
the return of that portion. of Saghahlen oscu
pi'-d by. Japanese troops, which is -the -part
held by Japan until . 1573 and - then ceded .by
treaty to Russia. . . ,
. The ': self-eacriflclng army, so dear to me,
withstood the a.Â«cau!t of a numerically su
perior enemy in Manchuria step by step dur
ing nineteen months, obstinately v fepulsling : his
advance. Under your leadership the army was
reorganized and strengthened * by , arrival
of troops from Russia, and It is now J greater
in numbers - and stronger than before.!-, I und
all Russia believe in the strength of my glori
ous army and in its readiness to sacrifice Itself
for the good of the fatherland, but my duty to
my conscience ' and to " the people inlru* trd to
me by God commands me not to acaln put to
the test the valor of Russian. ' men so dear to
my 'heart and not to-expose. them to fresh and
endless horrors of war in order â¢to retain half
of a remote island which Japan ceded to us in
1575, and I. have, . therefore,' accepted the pre
liminary peace negotiations* ;' .. -.. . '.
The Russian troops have repeatedly : : proved
during th)Â« eangulnary conflict their valor and

Convey this to njy dear army. ' May it know
that I and Russia value the sacrifices which It

pitiful plea made -by a father to the
keeper of the City Prison yesterday af
. tcrnoon.
The mother. Mrs.. E. S. Sands, has de
serted them and they are so young that
the father Is unable to care for them.
They are pretty little things, Thelma,

was out consulting with Secretary Wad

When he reached home from his work \u25a0
late on Saturday night the babies were I
crying piteously for their mother. The i
fatner rushed through the few rooms of I
their flat. 804 McAJHster street, but the '
house was empty. The mother had left !
some time in the afternoon. j
'U'ne father tried to hush the children.-!
He brought. ln come milk and fed them.,!
For a while they were quiet, but some--!
thing seemed to tell them that the one f
they needed had gone from them and
they continued to cry bitterly for "Ma- '
ma." \u25a0
â¢ "I have no Idea where she has gone or
yrhy she left," said Sands sadly. "I don't
ccc vow Bhe could bear to leave the chil
dren. I hs.*d to put them somewhere for
a while, though I dislike to do it."
Sands Is employed as a barber at "691

i FOR CARBOLIC ACID
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 3.â During this
evening's services at the Nazarene Mis-
Biftm at Fifth and I street* an unknown
man arose and combated some of the
doctrinal points that had been advanced.
Efforts to induce him to desist from his
arguments resulted in his producing a
bottle and declaring: "Only faith Is .nec
essary. If I have faith I can drink this
and It will not hurt me." With that he
swallowed the contents and a moment or
two later fell to the floor and soon died.
The bottle had contained carbolic acid.
The suicide Is not known here. He- was
about <5 years old* and neatly dressed.
In a note book in his pocket the name
"Gilbert" appeared. He also had several
cards of LoÂ» Angeles restaurants and
lodging houses. ' â¢ - \u25a0 - .

\u25a0 Southern Shansi. The insurgents have
burned many Government offices and ya
| nuns. Imperial troops, several thousand
j strongr. constating of cavalry, infantry
; and artillery, were sent on August 16 to
put down the Insurrection, but were ra
' pulsed by the rioters. Several high of

-Further details received of the up
rising against the Roman Catholic mis
sionaries in Yunnan show the situation
to be more serious than previously
reported. Not' only were; churches
destroyed and>looted, sacred vessels be
inir carried away, but in many district
French, priests were cruelly tortured
and killed. ' One priest, who escaped
into French -territory by making . his
way down the Hotekiang, secreted in
the bottom of a boat, reports that the
uprising was so sudden that . the mis
sionaries .were completely surprised.
The priest reported that twelve mis
sion houses along the Soko were burned
and in the outlying districts where
there were few foreigners not a vestige
of church property remains. The re
fugee stated that .the. rising .was due
to 7a7 a general anti-foreign movement,

â¢ Miles of slender masts on Market
street are abloom with flags and taste
ful decorations are displayed in front
of some business houses as a setting
to the great parade of the toiling
masses of the city that will move in
all the strength of unionism this morn

The air will be filled with music and
the cheers of the free and prosperous
toilers of a freedom-giving republic
will mingle in harmony with the in
spiring airs. In further celebration of
Labor day there will be literary ex
ercises and speeches by leaders of the
hianded workingmen in the afternoon
and a ball in the evening. As each
year the labor demonstration in San
Francisco has been bigger than that of
the year preceding, so it Is believed
that to-day's will in some measure
eclipse any that has gone before.
There will in some degree be a
double celebration of tlie day. ThÂ«

Special Dispatch to The Call.
OYSTER BAY. Sept. 3; â Astonished
residents living along the road from
Oyster Bay to Sagmore Hill to-day
beheld 'the rather unusual spectacle of
the President of the United States and
his wife trudging home from church lv
a blinding rainstorm. It is a good three
miles from the village to the Roosevelt
home and the President and Mrs.
RoosevHt were both drenched to thu
skin and thickly bespatted with mud
when they reached their domicile. Â«
The trip was taken from choice. The
President's fondness -for defying the
elements is well known, but to-day -was
the first time the inhabitants had ever
known Mrs. Roosevelt to join In the
sport.
The Roosevelt family, came to Christ
Church in a covered carriage, which
protected them from the downpour,
which was swirled along on the wings
of a. northeaster. At the conclusion of
the service the Roose\ - elt children. were
bundled into the carryall and sent
ahead., while the President and Mrs.
Roosevelt, with no protection whatever,
set out -on foot. The President laugh
ingly acknowledged the greetings of
the wonder-stricken residents gathered
in protected doorways.

\V BERKELEY'S GROWTH.
An indication cf tho growth of Berke
ley is given by City Clerk Merritt in some
figures tabulated since the adoption of the
building ordinance a year asp. In this
year there were 622 building permits is
sued, which represented 650 new buildings
erected, cr "an average of fifty-five a
month, or abcut two every day in. the
year- It is estimated that these 650 build
ings represented an expenditure of $1,750,
000 in Berkeley. If each of these build
ings was occupied by one family this
\u25a0would mean a gain to Berkeley in popula
tion of more than' 3000. These figures
show that Berkeley is growing in a de
rided and steady' manner, and they also

: Miles Medical Co., ElkharVlai 1MABIPOSA ARRIVES FROM TAHITI WITH
BIG CARGO AND MANY PASSENGERS.
Loses Blade of Her
Propeller in Mid-
Ocean.
Accident Causes a
Delay of Only
Few Hours.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
nt-emer Mariposa arrived in port late
yesterday afternoon, 12 days. 14 hours
and 43 minutes from Tahiti. Captain R.
T. Lawless reports that the weather was
tomewhat stormy, being very different
from the fine weather usualiy encoun
tered. On Augrust 21. when in latitude 5
pouth, the vessel lost one of her pro
peller blades. The accident caused her
to be a few hours late in her arrival in
San Francisco. .
The Mariposa brought her full com
plement of freight, and a soodly number
of passengers. Among the passengers
were General J J. O'Connell, U. S. A..
and his wife and daughter. Their trip
was taken especially for the benefit of
Mrs. O'Connell's health. She had been
very ill at the general hospital at the
Presidio for some time previous to her
departure. She returns greatly benefited
and delighted with her voyage to the
southern seas.
. The Mariposa also brought back two de
serters from the whaling vessel Charles
W. Morgan. They are Adolph Koch and
Harry Rose. The Morgan left San Fran
cisco on November 25 on a sperm whale
expedition. Koch and Rose say that they
had trouble with Captain Edwin J. Reed
and Mate Frank Morgan from the time
they crossed over the bar. They allege
that they had no sooner passed through
the Golden Gate than Captain Reed an
nounced that the ship would either be
a "home or a hell." They complain that
because they asked for tobacco they were
put in Irons for eight days They further
charge that the crew was ill-fed.
At Honolulu the two men deserted the
chip, and they pay the American Consul
there told them they had better go to
jail for their own protection if they re
fused to continue the voyage. They re
fused to return to the ship and re
mained in Jail until the Mariposa de
parted for this port, when they were put
on board by the American Consul.
Koch was the ship's carpenter, and
from his actions also appears to be what
!& known as a "sea lawyer." He says
he Is a German, and that he sent word
to the German Consul in Tahiti, by a
message through the American Consul
there, asking the Consul to cone and
him. The German Consul took no notice
of his request. The Morgan sailed on
August 18 for her home port In New Bed
ford.
Following Is a list of the Mariposa's
passengers :

BUNKERS CASE
IS PUZZLING
Seymour Tells a Few Persons
Boodler Has Confessed and
G ives Others Another Tale
MYSTERY IS CREATED
Ex-Seiiator Refuses to Admit
That He Has Told All He
Knows of the Big Scandal
Special' Dispatch to The Call.
:, SACRAMENTO, Sept.: 3.â The arrest
in .San Francisco -yesterday of Arthur
; I-.ee, ' a colbred cloakroom attendant at
the last session of .the Legislature,", has
supplied a> new development in j the cases
of the bcodltng Senators, Bunkers, French,
Emmofc .Jand ' Wright.^ It has â¢ also
served .to'.Venew the story that Bunk
ers, realizing that hejiad been deserted
by his' former associates In his.hour of
trouble, has made a confession to Dis
trict; Attorney Seymour in the hope; of
saving, himself \u25a0; from his five-year seri7
tence intUe penitentiary and given evi
dence, against "the other accused legis
lators; :,- -
\ Although' no. concealment was made
in San Francisco of ithe arrest there
of Arthur J^ee by Detective O'Nell yes
terday! District Attorney Seymour ap-"
peared to. deem it essential, that every
thing' connected .with' Lee's arrival and
imprisonment here should be enveloped
with a secrecy that smacks a little of
the theatrical. He refused to make a
statement' indicating .what Lee knows
about the,'. case; and ,he enjoined; upon:
the Sheriff's officers positive instruc
tions that, no reporter should be per-;
mitted to see the prisoner. The District
Attorney had apparently forgotten, that
one of his own deputies had ; already
made public the fact that Lee is want
ed because It is believed the accused
Senators placed the marked bribe
money in his hands to be got rid of.
The detective secured Lee, but not the
marked money. '>\u25a0 '. !''\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0 \u25a0.'.'\u25a0\u25a0.
LittlÂ«f importance is attached here. to
the arrest , of Lee, despite the official
air of mystery, and the incident prob
ably would have caused, no comment
were it not that it has renewed the
story that Bunkers had turned State's
evidence. In this feature of the case,
too.'Dlstrict Attorney Seymour has in
troduced an element of deep mystery,
and while giving ; personal friends to
understand : that Bunkers has made a
confession, ho meets newspaper men
with the denial that anything of the
sort has taken place. The District At
torney had nothing to say to-da^y, even
in confirmation of facts that. are pub
lic property. . / \u25a0\u25a0 â¢
It has been no secret here that Bunkers
has felt a sense of having 'been utterly
abandoned by these ; friends arfd asso
ciates upon whom he counted for â¢ help
and that he would not; be disposed to
refuse, an opportunity" to 'save himself
if he could (do it by Involving others who
have been deaf to his appeals for assist
ance. It also has been , no secret that
Bunkers? has had long- interviews >; with
District Attorney Seymour, at which a
stenographer was present 'and that., the
subject did not relate, \u25a0 \u25a0as has been
claimed, I to ' borifis.*' \u25a0- i ! i .*^*'^ ' >~ '"' v'" 1 '-
Bunkers was seen in the county Jail to
day and asked If it were true he had
made a confession. ' * irst 1 he said" it was
not true, and then* he said he /"would
neither affirm nor deny that. he* had made
a confession. r> .. â¢ ;\u25a0
He was asked if he would appear
against senator Emmons at the latter's
trial. ?â¢ ' ... ' ; '\u25a0-
"That will depend upon circumstances,"
he said. Asked If these circumstances
would be influenced by what the District
Attorney might do, he nodded In the af
firmative, addingV "and my lawyer, too;
1 haven't seen my, counsel yet." ; -, *
Bunkers then remarked that* he 'had
been in Jail for. four months and not a
man had come to see him : not a hand
hud been lifted to help him. ; ;
"I deserve 'better treatment than that,"
he Â«ald, "for I have befriended a great
many menâ some Senators and \u25a0 * others
outside the Legislature."
Bunkers said he knew nothing about
the arrest â¢> of Arthur Lee, the -colored
man, adding he could not remember him.
It is . expected that Senator Moreho'use
will be here to-morrow, and' that It r will
then be ââ¢ determined Bunkers
shall save himself by implicating others.
Even should the District "Attorney desire
such an arrangement, it-will -be neces
sary to consult the Governor, who is the
onlyoflicfal wlth-power to'saveÃunk
ers from his five-year term in the peni
tentiary. :_ -\u25a0â¢\u25a0' â¢â¢â¢\u25a0".. -;\u25a0

A FINE TRADE EXHIBIT.
IT is rather singular that after all the sanguine predictions of the
trade improvement which would surely follow the establishment
of peace between Russia and Japan that the very week in which
that peace became almost virtually effected should witness a re
versal of conditions, at least in the United States, but such was the
fact. For many months the country's bank clearings have shown a
large and steady increase over the corresponding periods last year,
but last week the tables suddenly turned and the exhibit was a de
crease of 35.6 per cent from 1905. About half of the most important
cities were ranged in the column of losses.
The showing is not of particular significance, except as to the
point just noted. It would appear, however, that the events in
the Far East have not the overshadowing influence upon trade con
ditions which the world has been led to believe. Immediately after
the Portsmouth agreement had been reachedthe continental bourses
exhibited a buoyant tone, with more activity and advancing quota
tions for European and Asiatic securities, , but the American ex
changes did not respond to any appreciable extent. We were doing
a good business all during the war and we kept on doing it when
the war was practically over. This would seem to indicate that
the commerce of the United States is so vast and self reliant that
whatever goes on in distant lands produces after all but little effect
in this country. From this standpoint the non-response of the dif
ferent markets of the country to the Portsmouth, agreement must
be a matter of gratification to every American citizen. It shows
us that we are not the tail of anybody's kite, but a power unto
ourselves.
But although the bank clearings for the week showed the de
crease mentioned above, the trade reports from the different sec
tions of the country indicated no falling off in business. They
contained the usual optimistic sentiments to which we have so long
been accustomed, recorded the familiar statements of an active dis
tributive business, an expanding autumn demand for all sorts of
merchandise, plenitude of funds, easy collections, increasing rail
road earnings, and in short all the elements which show the coun
try to be still on the crest of the wave of prosperity.
Some lines of food products, however, are apparently tending
toward a lower range of values, due to the incoming of abundant
new crops on the markets. Other staples, on the contrary, are very
buoyant at? the prevailing high prices. Thus wool is in active de
mand by manufacturers, though in California the market for raw
wool is at a standstill, as the high prices demanded by growers have
driven buyers out of the market. Hides and leather are active and
firm all over the world, and whenever there is a change in prices :
it is almost invariably in the direction of higher prices. The iron
and steel industry is in excellent condition, an advance in pig iron
is confidently predicted arid the Steel Corporation is in the market
for 75,000 tons of pig iron for delivery before the end of the year.
Rail orders to the amount of 100,000 tons were placed in the mar
ket some ten days ago, and the Pennsylvania* Railroad is said to
be in the market for 200.000 tons additional. The rail mills are
reported sold up well into the first half of 1906. The Steel Cor
poration has ordered every modern furnace into .blast, but in spite
of this will have to draw upon outside sources to supply the short
age in supplies of the crude material. Copper has been showing
marked strength at rising prices and many operators are predicting
a boom in this important metal.
Stocks in Wall street continue high and most of. them are pay
ing increased dividends. It is estimated that the dividends to* be
disbursed by Eastern corporations during September will aggre
gate over $14,200,000, or fully $3,500,000 over the total paid in Sep-,
tember, 1904. This is a most gratifying exhibit.
One of the most brilliant exhibits for August was that made
by San Francisco. Our August, bank clearings were $162,338,490,
against $129,529,786 for August, 1904, while for the year to date
they are $1,165,950,000. against $980,30i',000 for the same period in
1904. This is a gain of $185,648,750 thus far this year and indicates
just so much expansion of trade here during the -first eight months
of the year. This showing ought to satisfy anybody. But it has
been frequently noted during the past year or two that the very
best commercial reports have been those from the three Pacific
Coast States.
It will thus be seen that the business of the United States is
still in most excellent condition. War or peace abroad, the country
proceeds on its prosperous way, sufficient unto itself, self-sustaining,
. possessed of such ample sources that it is practically independent
of the rest of the world. The thought ought to be a source of pride
to every American citizen. Â«
/^^N HECKS to Russia's ambition to expand her empire have been
l\ -^ effectively added to by the recent appointment of Lord M into
as Viceroy of India to succeed Lord Curzon. Japan has called
a halt to that ambition as it tried to reach 'out' through -Manchuria,
China and Korea ; and as the military genius of Oyama accomplished
that, so another commander, Kitchener, on behalf of England, is
to check Russian advance toward India. That Kitchener may have
a free hand to thoroughly do this is the meaning of Lord Minto's
appointment. He is sent there to be subservient to Kitchener's
plans and to make civil control in India subordinate to the military.
Unwillingness to submit to that subordination being the reason for
Curzon's resignation, Minto must be fully aware that such will be
required of him and thus accepts.it as a. condition of viceroyalty.
Minto's six years' experience as Governor General- of Canada
gave him good training for the role of figurehead that! _ he is now
called upon to play in India. He came out to the Dominion with
energetic ambitions and much capacity, expecting to do something.
The lesson he learned was that his role was to do* nothing except
look pleasant. 'The only defect of, his administration was that he
did not early enough recognize the passivity of his role, and the
fact that the real control of affairs was in other hands.
Even in the matter of conferring imperial titles his "direction
was resented, the Canadians thinking they were great enough to
select the men who were to be thus honored. The records and
criticisms of the new Viceroy's career neither show him to be a
remarkably great man nor yet One whose quality and achieve
ments can be smiled down upon as insignificant. He has, worked his
way up thoroughly as a military man and has served with distinc
tion under Lord Roberts in Egypt. His position will be such that,
while Kitchener need not use him much in his plans, he can make
him useful if he so desires. ; . \u25a0
This sudden change not only in the personality but the general
policy of the government of, lndia is not to be regarded as an omi
nous exaltation of* military over civil power in the world's great
concerns. It is merely a special dealing with a special crisis, and
a calling to untrammeled control of it the man who is pre-eminently
fitted for the task. The necessity of making Russia realize the
futility of trying to push her empire into India is great, but; that
is not the only reason for military organization in that vast /de
pendence of Great Britain. There 300,000,000 people are ruled by
30O,CKX) of an alien race. These can be ruled only by superior
force. England knows that whenever things come to,the fell test
of force the genius fbr'military organization possessed by Kitchener
is the most forceful of her assets. So, for the nonce she must leVhis

Life Saving and Matrimony
'( (]\u25a0 a *LL through the books," said Ber

, *"Â» sixth .street pier, Chicago, , the
other day, "you'll; find that when a chap
saves a girl's life from drowning in the
surging billow there is nothing for' lt but
to have the two go and get 'hitched as
soon as they : can learn each other's real
names and borrow enough to pay the min

"That's all the ""poor fools that write
know about it, and if they do go out arid
save a girl's life or two they wouldn't be
so matrimonial. If there's anything un
der heaven that makes a woman hate a
man it is to have him pull her out of the
dark water in a limp, disheveled mass,
with water running out of her eyes and
ears and nose and more to come out: of
her mouth just as soon as you can roll
her around.
"And when' the man comes to himself
and finds out~ what a blamed fool the
wom^n'was to put herself in the way of

You see, Bert Colwell was the oldest
swimmer down at' the beach. For ten, or
ele%'en years, while generations of swim
mers haa come and gone, he had stuck to
it, wet and dry, fair weazher, and foul,
cold weather, and . hot. He was by all
means the best swimmer of the- lot. and
was. good for a voyage to .the crib any
day when the water was above 63 degrees
and there . weren't any .cross winds' to
set up disturbing surface currents.
During his sojourn there during all
these years, Bert had 3 saved some dozen
or sq of lives, unobtrusively but effectual
ly, and t.was really, entitled to a,' whole
bouquet" of Carnegie medals and things,
if he had ever entered the hero busi
ness. Being a plain business man, who
had the good sense never to let his busi
ness .interfere with .his ; summer swim
ming, he had all he could attend to with
out going around all brassed up like the
leader of an Italian band. And for all
these things we respected him according
ly, and, in the rare intervals that he
caw lit to tell of anything he had done,
we were the most attentive of listeners,
for the excellent reason that he never
talked unless he had something to say.
"Remember that pretty! little pUimp
girl that used to come down here just
after the world's fair, George?" turning
to the proprietor of the pier.
"The one we all thought you were going
to marry?" asked George.
"The same." said, Bert.
"Didn't you sort' of save her life, or
something?" asked George.
"That's the whole story," said Colwell,
and he went on, with occasional-interrup
tions from the crowd, sitting there in the
evening sun, tanned and wet and hearty
from a half-mile swim in water ; that was
like nothing so much as a compound of
czone and fresh milk.
"You see." he said, "she was just as
sweet and pretty a gir.aa anybody over

wasn't built just exactly for what you'd
call an athlete, but she liked me and I
liked her. and she and I had just gone far

A TALE -OF MIDNIGHT.
IT was the solemn hour of midnight,
Adolphus; that bodeful hour when
â¢ churchyards yawn and graves give
forth their uneasy dead. Within the
house all was still; without, all was
silence, except for the awe-inspiring re
marks of Thomas H.Cat, who was en
gaged in telling his Marier how de
voted to her he felt himself to be.
At last the stillness within the house
was -.broken by a peculiar, gurgling,
aspirating,' groaning, chuffing, sibilant,
moaning, snuffling noise which indicated
that, the man of the house was asleep,
and no, not sno"ring, Adolphus. for the
man "vowed that he never did that, but
making .sounds that some misguided
people- consider snoring.
The man had been thus engaged in
moving boxes around in his attic for
some time, when the woman by his side
cautiously lifted her head from the pil
low and listened, although listening did
not appear ;to be necessary .unless the
woman .was deaf, ' for the noises the
man was making" might have been
heard -three townships away.
After listening thus for a -little time
the woman carefully stepped from the
bed. approached the man's trousers and
abstracted therefrom as much coin of
i the realm* as she considered it safe to
I abstract. This she deposited In a place
known only to herself.
. . It was the deed of a midnight thief,
or.' if the man and woman jointly were
wea-lthy. of -course, we will admit that
it was the deed of a midnight klepto
maniac' The woman was stealing from
her husband.
Do I blame Her, Adolphus? Not on
your ; tintype! The man . was one or
.these, small-bore, thirty-seven-for-a
hlckel I fellows who pay the household
expenses themselves (so long as they
meet their regutrements) and allow
their wives; 15 cents a, month for pin
money \u25a0 and incidental expenses.
And the 'woman who would not steal
from that variety of alleged man deserves
email .sympathy. ; Certainly she Is not
fit to be a wife, for; in tfce very nature
of the "case she could bring nothing but
chicken-hearted apologies for children
into the: world.. Every time the wife of
such a husband makes a midnight visit
to his trousers she should be encored
until she goes again. Good girl! say I.
Her method may ; not be very self-re
specting, but It is the most self-respect
ing that such, a husband will permit.

THE need of an all-over cover garment of some description Is one of
the most imperative, no matter how limited or how varied the
wardrobe may- be. When the garment is likewise waterproof a dis
tinct advantage is v gained. The new griffonette cloth pos3eses this de
sirable quality without in any way suggesting a mackintosh. In fact,
it looks exactly as though theÂ« coat were fashioned for the dressiest
of wear. The one pictured shows a delightfully fashionable air. The
top part fits smoothly over the shoulders, with mannish collar ..and
lapel and broad strappings that are folded in with the fullness at the
waistline in front, and in the back extend down into little postillion
tabs. The skirt portion is pleated to the top. the fronts interlined
with a princess haircloth and folded back In revere form, while the
sleeve is a full bishop pattern, with the fullness pleated and stitched
to meet the cuff.
Plain Talk to Husbands
Angela Morgan
T. HERE is another side to this oft
emphasized story of the wife who
shatters! her husband's blissful illu
sions by" neglecting her appearance after
marriage. ..; J '
.So much has been written in favor of
the disappointed . husband that I wonder
wives dq-> not rise in rebellion and insist
that their side be pointed out. ,
If the truth were told it would be dis
covered that many a husband Is directly
responsible for his helpmeet's failure to
preserve after marriage the comeliness
of person she was so careful to maintain
during courtship. .
Unreasonable^ though it may sound, the
very" husbands' who complain most pa
thetically of their wives" changed appear
ance and ] carelessness In dress have by
their own : words \and actions brought
about the unhappy metamorphosis.
By open interference with a wife's
methods of keeping comely, by pre
sumptuous dictation concerning the
time to which she should limit her
self in â¢ dressing and by emphatic objec
tion to any display of interest on her part
in = preserving her good looks this type of
husband stands directly in the way of a
woman's achieving, as wife, the attrac
tive exterior; she was able to present
when she was free to do as she pleased.
Marriage gives to no man the right to
Interfere with his wife's independence in
matters of this kind. Why it is that a
man who during courtship would tremble
in fear of offending his sweetheart by the
most j trifling S personal suggestion should
when he becomes her husband assume
the right to dictate to her in affairs that
are distinctly her province, is beyond the
comprehension" of womankind. \u25a0
But that is just what this kind of hus
band does. If he was brought up with
old-faÃhloned ideas about "beauty un
adorned,", and if his mother abhorred face
powder, -he will Insist that his wife go
about with a shining nose and scintil
lating forehead.:
If he .has an aversion for cold cream
and' -toilet powders he makes his wife
aware of the fact in no uncertain terms.
He condemns her curling irons as harm
ful, laughs at her emollients for remov
ing sunburn and tells her she Is silly and
childish if she is particular about ribbons
and beading and lace. If she is thought
less enough*, ever to "primp" in his pres
ence he tells her. she ought to be darning
his socks instead of - wearing out the car
pet before the mirror. .
After he has '. fussed and ridiculed , and
objected so repeatedly that existence to
his wife ('becomes a burden, the disheart
ened creature gives in and goes about un
curled,-unpowdered. and unadorned by
frills. She tries to ; be content with the
pattern her; beloved prescribes as to what
constitutes t a sensible, womanly woman.
But she is conscious of lessening Interest
in life. . - B^MJfeffltÃÃWSl

to exercise the authority he believes to
be his and commands the woman he has
chosen for his .wife to abandon such
vanities.
If he would only be content with the
result, all well and good^ But he never
is, no matter what he may pretend to
the contrary: he has an eye for the beau
ty that is adorned.
Husbands, if you want your wives to
preserve their looka, don't prevent them
by interftring with their independence of
action in "personal matters.
Unless you are willing to go about with
the beard of an Arabian and the Â» long
locks of an Elijah, don't ridicule your
wives for employing the mehods .that are
necessary in maintaining a clean, trim,
delightful exterior.
If you cannot consent to. respect a
woman's rights in this respect, then keep
quiet about being disillusioned after mar^^
riage. It is your own fault. j"
Find Sauerkraut Mine.
2 Phollippevllle. in Algiers. Is determined
to keep up the reputation for always pro

ago a. winged tortoise was reported to
have been discovered there: -next there
came ao account of a -."carnlverous
stone." whatever that may be. The lat
est marvel is a mine of sauerkraut, un
covered by workmen whCe digging. It
was beneath a small hillock, and was a

mostly cabbages, with the smell and taste

before in the history of trans-Atlantic
travel have such throngs; been clamoring
for passage to this country >, as are # now

the number of voyagers who have ar
rived from Europe' within the last few
days,' each -ship coming in, : crowded to
its capacity." .:. ;^ :,
. Early in the. season It was evident that
the rush to Europe thisyear would at
tain record-breaking proportions. Agents
found explanations for the Increased out
ward travel in the fact that it was an
off-year, [ill elections /and that It was,
moreover, unusually prosperous. .
Now that home-coming is in order, the
various lines are confronted with diffi
culties. About sixty per* cent of those
who went abroad took the precaution of
arranging for return passage- These have
no worries, as the companies are . bound
tc find accommodations for them, but the
careless forty r>er cent must take such
quarters as they can get. .
"If it were " 'not \u25a0\u25a0 for . this .-almost"un

of the agents, "we could be doing an ex

we receive numerous applications for. pas

HEROES GATHER
IN EXCITEMENT
Grand Army Men Preparing
to gffold ; Thirty-Ninth An
nual Session at Denver
CHANGES ANTICIPATED
Election of Commander in.
Chief and Eevisions of
Constitution Are Planned
DENVER; Sept." 3.â The thirty-ninth
annual encampment of the Grand Army
of the Republic will begin in this city
to-morrow. The city Is crowded with
guests and heavily loaded trains are
arriving at thb union station from all
directions. .
In order :to facilitate the handling
of passenger trains the Santa Fe has
ordered all freight trains annulled- for
the next twenty- four hours. The travel
on .this line .is .. exceedingly heavy.
Other roads where traffic , is heavy are
considering 'the advisability of taking
similar action. V
Members Of the local executive coftl
mittee persist in -their belief that the
coming encampment will be the larg
est in the history of the organization.
At headquarters and in the lobbies of
hotels already Is heard the discussion
of the election, of officers and the place
of, the next meeting. : >
There are ' five candidates . for the of
fice of commander-ln-chief. namely.
Corporal James Tanner of â¢ New York,
Robert Brown 'of "Ohio, Colonel Bur
roughs of New Jersey, ex-Congresa
man, Charles ; Burton of Missouri, and
General George Stone of California. -, -
The' custom; of giving the office of
senior vice, commander to the city en
tertaining the encampment has brought
two candidates .for that position Into
the field from this city, General George
WV Coofc.'Vchalrman of the local en
campment executive committee, and U.
S.:Hollister. :.-.-\u25a0
Some of the important business to be
considered by the encampment in -its
secret sessions, which begin â¢' on',Thurs
day! morning, will be proposed changes
in â¢ the constitution and recommenda
tions : tO; the congressional committee.
The' latter will be asked to endeavor
to have Congress pass. a new service
pension bill that will have no age
limit. One proposition is to pension
veterans of the Civil. War,;whether
injured or not, on a per diem basis;
that is to . say, a certain amount for
each day of service.
There Is a proposition under consid
eration to 'change the constitution so
as to provide for a new office, that of a
patriotic," instructor./ Each post will
have an instructor of this kind, whose
duty it will.be to officiate In the public
schools. as a teacher of patriotism. A
department official, to be, created, will
have supervision of the post instruc
tors and a national officer will be in
supreme \u25a0 authority over all of them.
Each shall have an insignia of office. â¢
\u25a0; Another :. proposed constitutional
amendment Is one changing the ratio
of ', .representation In the national' en
campment from one 'representative for
750 members to one for every 500
members, and still another proposes to
make it obligatory upon post 3 to sus
pend members jin arrears for twelve
months when two months' notification
has, been given.
Leaders are urging their comrades
to work to get the more. than 300,000
veterans who are not G. A. R. members
to affiliate. In this way they assert the
great decrease in membership through
mortality can be -met for the present.

Skipper o( Trumcntana Files Protest
AKatnat Sloop'Uneen, Which He
Ran Down Daring; Race. -
The tide did not serve favorably for
cruising up the bay : Saturday after
noon.,but several of the Corinthian and
San Francisco yachts started from their
moorlng3, the skippers" intention being
to drop anchor In Paradise Cove or any
other convenient point that might be
reached.
Roy C. Ward, skipper of the -yawl
Tramontana. which during last Sun
day's race of the San Francisco Yacht
Club from Vallejo. to Sausalito. while
en. the. port' tack fouled Dr. T. I* Hill's
sioop. Queen, on the : starboard tack,
and. having: the right of way. haa filed
a protest with the regatta committee.
In which : he endeavors .to throw the
blame for the collision upon the- Queen's
skipper. "Ward . asserts that he , was
obliged to bring the Tramontana' about
to avoid running: aground in shoal wa
ter" and that unaer such circumstances
the Queen; though having: the right o"
way*,, should ' have , yielded ilt.toCthe
Tramontana. .The rule.' howeyer,; clearly
ly provides that a. i skipper who* wishes
to get out of shoal water, must hall the
other yacht and ask if or sea room. No
hail^ was 'given and 'the universal 'rule

The Seals and the SiwashÂ«s wero nos
ing It all aJong the line yesterday on
tlie diamond, in the morning at Oak
land the northern stars nosetl Uncle to
the finish by a run. The result was
exactly opposite when tne big crash
came at Recreation Hark. The Siwasnes
had one royal chance to grab botu
games. They failed to make good when
they had the sa.cks crowded and also
when they could have cut tha Seals
down without any damage.
The quality of bail took a tumble
from the article that had been passed
out- during the week. Both teams
booted the leather with a regularity
that" was surprising and aggravating-.
But for the lively incidents that came
to pass in both battles it could well be
called bush ball, for the talent was
much on -the wane.
V> hen the eighth spasm roiled around
yesterday it looked bad for the Seals.
The Siwashes had them canned 2 to 1
and Shields was twisting 'cm over with
his double^jointed process, which was
the real motion of mystery. He fell
down in the eighth, when lie hit Gocu
nstuer a wallop In the slats. Wilson fol
lowed with a bunt. When Shields
fielded "the 'ball, there was on one to
cover first, so both were safe.
Every fan in the lot howled for a
fare-y-e-well when Wheeler dumped one
at the plate and sacrificed both meti
along. . They did not expect much of,
"Waldron, for he had gone the strike-out
route twice. However, he was there with
a drive over the third cushion this time
and lie chased both Gochnauer and Wil
son in and broke up the game.
The Siwashes made both their runs in
tht lirst two innings and errors let 'em
both through. Irwin's boot of Blanken
sjhip"s drive allowed Walters .to score
with the full house in. the opening
spasm- Hall made a llying-' trip over
the paths in the second, when Goch
nauer threw his grounder into the
bleachers.
Gochnauer had thirteen chances and
he got away with eleven of. them. Mah
ler caught two men trying to make
second on bad throws. Both these plays
were made with one hand and were
the best of their kind ever seen on the
lot. The score:

Mr. Macdoiiougli r s Great Son

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KB W. YORKv Sept. 3.â Where is Artful ?
Horsemen . are growftig, more ' and more
puzzled as. to the. causes and 'the; objects
of the policy which is being pursued with
the crack three-year-old : of \u25a0 the ' Whitney
barn;* the .filly which j according :to .her
friends alone . of . all \u25a0 her age is ; equal to
the' task of taking the mighty. -SyEonby
into camp. Eight "-; weeks . have \, gone ; by
since Artful won \u25a0 the Brighton | handicap^
and although she was '= shipped ; to | Sara T
toga to prepare for her engagements
there, she never once went out under col
ors at the Springs. \\ ,v, v -'\u25a0 U v :
: She has I been in steady training prac
tically all summer, which shows' not pnly
that she was; being prepared for definite
races, but that she was fit and. well. Yet
as- fast' as, events" came -up \u25a0 for % decision
Ar tf ul's name ' was '\u25a0 missing | if rprri. : the \ list
of starters. ' There seems ; little ground' to
fear that shehas : ;gone, wrong; for week
after . week she > has i been running \u25a0work"
outs and â¢ trials, which' show ; she j must:- be
nearly ready for her best race. 'i ' V ' '\u0084
Under; the circumstances it seems, al
most? too -much to; hopeTtha; pair will,
come together in the annual Champion
stakes at Sheephead j Bay, next? Saturday.
To send the filly out against such a well
seasoned horse as Sysonby now is .without
one or two good races in her would seem
like tempting fate and inviting failure...
Ormondale, the - Futurity winner, . has |
been slightly ailing and will' probably. not
race again this season. , The big race left
him a little sore, and last week a touch
of blood-poisoning set in,. which produced
a, pasty rash and altogether broKe up his
preparation fot the" Flatbush , stakes. >-.; |
5 Mr; ;Macdonough^ of-- ' California^. who
bred and owns- him,. a3 v well; as -'Andrew
Miller and Trainer, ... elchi think far. too
highly of his future prospects to take any
chance of damaging- him by running .him
v/hen riot quite fit. 'The' chances, are 'he
will be turned out and will get .'an opporr

ALL FANS HAIL
THE POLICEMEN
City's Bravest Fight Hard
Against' tlie Finest but
Fall Shy' by Three Runs
\u25a0 â If any : ball fan is skeptical enough to
doubt whether the coppers are the cham
pion, ball tossers of.thia great city, they
should just' ask the fire fighters. They
know and if; they are game enough they
wlli tell, for yesterday mornlnar they got
theirs: for the second time without a miss
on the Eigrhth street- lot. Fully 10.000
rooters were on the scene to watch the
fun .and- they got "a run for their coin.
The proceeds "of the game will go to
the Youths' Directory. That Institution
will profit'about $4000 by the exhibition.
Every one who was there agreed it was
a grand game of ball, better by far than
was ever seen in the banana or the bush
league. - To top off the greatness In a
fitting way, James Edward I Britt, cor
rectly attired In the latest Mllpitas rid
ing: togs, was ; there to umpire on the
bases. ;-'â¢\u25a0.\u25a0..\u25a0.â¢'".: \u25a0 '\u25a0','\u25a0 ~ \u25a0''\u25a0\u25a0. ' . ... - â¢
Everybody tried, to be the whole show,
but there were so many stars that the fans
finally voted that every one. on the lot
was a great -man, even Burglar Hammil.
Ha managed to put a' flock, of *. files on
the' small book in the left field station
and he did not have to send In a call
for the wagon either.
I The coppers figured strongly In the first
inning when Mr.- Zamlock, whom the
braves rung in to pitch, had a fit .of
passing men: and of .going up In the air.
While the whistles tooted and the clubs
rapped on the'benches, a bunch of four
did a' double-quick: hotstep and reported
on time ;at the plate Two more blues
came through in. the third and another in
the , fourth, while the ladder jumpers
were still there with, the big O.
It came to pass that the firemen. got
very much into ~ the going during the
progress of round six. They began to
bingle and the cops began to boot.- One,
two, three, four and finally five' of the
red-shlrted kids dashed up along the line
and reached the top In safety before the
.third man . fell > where there, was no
\u25a0blanket to catch him.- . ;-
'From "that time. It. was one of those
'Old battle I. royals. .The firemen swore
they would epp the big piece of the
score,' while ' the â¢ coppers averred they
v.ould all be pinched first. The game was
broken up in the ; eighth when Jerry
Dinan'a hosts ! tore loose once more and
In : i. twinkling two more were j sent
through and then It was over for keepsv
Mayor Schmitz lined the first ball over
the . plate and ; It looked good enough for.
a strike. ââ¢ Jerry Dlnan was ' there in a
box, Cas were Chief r Sullivan, Assistant
Chief Dougherty, Captain' Duke, Commls
stoner'Parry. Michael Joseph Conboy and
all the other, dignatories. The score:

TBACK PROVES SLOW
Automobilists Take Turns
Gingerly â¢at Ingleside
and Competition Is Tame
The crowd in the grand stand at Ingle- ..;
side racetrack took on the appearance, of
a handicap day gathering yesterday, theTi
great structure being bright with thr.,
light-colored dresses of the ladies. The"
infield was thronged with automobiles j~
The , occasion was a race meeting, the .
programme ol which Included bicycle,
motorcycle, automobile, and sprinting"
competitions. ,
The prospect of seeing the flying aoto
ists probably attracted the majority of
the 5000 spectators. The auto races proved
a disappointment, the , condition . of the
track making' fast time impossible. The
fastest mile at this style ,of join,? was
made In 1:23 4-5. Thi3 time was beaten by
the motorcycles.
The sensation of the day was the defeat
of the crack representatives of the Gar-'.
den City Wheelmen \ and of the Reno
"Wheelmen by the California Cycling Club
of this, city. .The race was at ten miles.':,
each. team starting: at a different part of
the track and trying .to overhaul the oth-'
ers. The v winning team of three ricters
covered the ten miles In . 23 minutes 43
seconds, nine seconds faster than the
Garden City .team's time. The riders
were "carried off the truck In triumph by
their clubmates.
There was a narrow path some eight
feet from the pole. "When a rider tried
to pass another and rode off thl3 path he
usually met with j disaster. There were
numerous falls, but no serious Injuries
resulted.
Large fields started in the handicap bi
cycle races, but all the excitement" was
eliminated by a heavy fos which settled
down on the track and ob3cured*most of .
the competition. The results In detail:
120-yard dash â Won by Garcia; Glarner sec

THIS CIRCUS IS REALLY
THE GREATEST ON EARTH
HUGE TENJI JAMMED LIKE -A SAimWECtiN
SOME OF THE JOTS OF THE CIRCUS THAT IS NOW IN TOWN, AS SEEN BY
THE CALL'S. ARTIST. WHOSE ENTHUSIASTIC SKETCHING WAS CUT
SHOUT BY LACK OF SPACE. ' .
Viva lemonade, peanuts and spangles!
When the drama is a dead one ana
opera is down- and out, and even.vaude
ville takes the count the circus will
still be taking the coin. <
There. were enough people in Barnum
and Bailey's tent last night to' make
you wonder who staid at home to take
care of the sick.
Every advance agent says his is the
greatest on earth. When Press Agent
Coxey (no relation to the hero who lead
the advance of the Hobeaux to Wash
ington) announced that he had it at
last people looked tired. He insisted
and his appearance along the line
mea^nt -Duck." , Now they want to slip
him an apology. .
There was one man who tried to see
it all. He- twisted his head from the
trap. -:e marvels to the Japanese equili
brists, and at the same time tried to
keep tab on a shapeliness in pink tights
jrt-ho was coyly balancing on her nose
on a slack wire. At the same time his
right eye . was gathering in . a view of
a Turkish muscle dance, while his left
was watching Slivers, "the "Kink" of
clowns.
The human camera obscura lasted for
about . five # minutes. '* He* complained of
severe pains in the neck. At the Cen
tral Emergency ' Hospital they removed
thirty-seven kinks from his neck and he
is stiir being unwound.
There were old friends in the side shows
âthe fat lady, . the living â¢ skeleton, the
India-rubber man, the "Circassian beauty
and all of the friends of our childhood's
happy days. The only thing that makes
Barnum & Bailey's bigger than in the
days "whf n you and 1 were young, Mag
gie." is that it it's bigger. It's colossal,
THE^ SAN^ FRANGISGQ;^^
stupendous andâ the rest . of the. adjec
tives are on the bill "boards. â¢- ' '.; '-,'\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 .
There are , more' things about the cir- i
cus that are familiar: to' the oldest in- |
habitant beside the saw-dust and' the j
lemonade. The .very, oldest . inhabitant
was there last ( 'night! When a certain |
damsel, who shall ' be nameless, hove \u25a0 mÂ»i
sight in fleshlings' the eldest 5 chuckled. . j
"That's her,". he mumbled; "seen her j
at the first Barnum's when I was a kid. '
She winked at me onceV. That's her. She !
was Ariel, the queen of the air, in; them
days, but I'm blessed if them ain't the
same pair of tights." -"
The Dip of Death is one 6f the things
our fathers couldn't see. There were less
complex .and startling ways of breaking
necks in their day. \u25a0'\u25a0â¢\u0084*''. . . ?
Maybe the- risk that Mile, de Tiers takes
is really slight, but most of the men who
saw the dip would sooner take a chance
in a foyr-round go with one of the.lionsâ
winner, to take all. It was thrilling enough
to make women. shut their eyes and men
sit tight to show, that they were' not par
ticularly excited over it. *. Of course, there
were some who would not believe that
the. feat is dangerous unless the 'woman
were hurled across the ring and crushed
to death. But most of the "crowd were
satisfied that the/ quiet little French
woman was. flirting with the ferryman of
the , Styx she trusted herself entire
ly to the laws of. j inertia. There was a
universal sigh of relief when the dip of
death was accomplished safely. . -
j Jolo, the cyclist, who: shoots down an
Incline, . then across space to a platform,
was not so fortunate.- In crossing' the .gap
his bicycle wobbled a trifle and he was
flung to- the ground with terrible .force.
Women began to shriek and attendants
rushed , over to him. For an, instant he
lay 'motionless,* and people began to fear
that he was dangerously, hurt, : but he
struggled ;; t to his feet and, declining as
sistance, walked off. ': '"
. The ; box office showed that nearly. 15,000
people enjoyed the show. ; The seating
capacity , is. 14.500, and . there wasn't room
for a | slender . sardine when the band be-,
gan to , play. ," \u25a0 . â¢\u25a0,â¢'.'
They, have something really new in the
clown line, at Barnum. & Bailey's. He
answers tb .the name of Slivers at meal
times." He- is a whole ; baseball game by
himself , and a'better^article than is some
times.- put, up at ' Recreation Park. . \u25a0 He
can bat to the long right field, catch.him
self out and double himself at first. "
Any one who has , no -mother-in-law and
has nothing to wonder about j can see J the
tents and impedimenta of the show and
guess how. they, were put up and arranged
in, a single day. > The problem- "How^old
is Anne?" is easier to guess. ' l' v ' *
There is everything in Barnum & Bail
ey's circus that ever.wasin' a, circus, and
much that- was; never seen before .In : a
circus: It*' brings , back childhood days

LURED TO ROOM
AND LIFE TAKEN
Wong Lock, a Chinese from -Uos'An
geles, was shot Â§ and killed -' in ja' room
on the, second story of "735%. Jackson
street yesterday morning shortly after
8 o'clock. Four shots were heard by
people who were in the vicinity, and
the police were, notified.
_ Detective Matheson went to the place
and discovered that after the. murder
had been committed the body ' had
been dragged out to the hallway and
left : there. On the . room
Matheson . found that some' one V had
tried to : wash the bloodstains from the
floor, but had - only partly- succeeded.
The' murderer- had escaped ; through a
window : in â¢ the rear and had run ' over
the roof; to Stockton street.
Two of; the. bullets "had taken effect.
One had entered immediately over the
heart, causing instant death, and the
other had .entered the head above , the
lefti cheekbone. .The room where the
murder was ; committed was : rented by,,
Lou Lem, but he was unable to throw
any light on the identity of the mur
derer^
The murdered Chinese came here re
cently from | Los Angeles l and was not
well . known tin ' Chinatown. s .' He was â¢ a
native,; son. ;D"ete'ctive;Mathe
son. nor Sergeant "Ross, -.in " charge â¢ of
the Chinatown squad, believes. that the
killing was: due to the recent troubles
among -the tongs, but 'rather!, from a
personal I grudge. They, were - informed
that Wong Lock' was a degenerate and
had probably been lured jto the room.
The ; body was removed to . the Morgue.

Biggest â¢ Success of the
Four Home-Made Plays
MUCH TO ENTERTAIN
Denis O'Sullivan Is WeU

Was Written by; His Wife
The "made in California" play con
tinues to arrive. Four plays in as many
weeks is the record of the local : play
wrights and producers. Last, week the
Alcazar gave trie 'first of the quartet,
in Jack London. and Lee Bascom's one
act play, v "The Great Interrogation."
Yesterday afternoon "Patrick Bidwell"
watched the first production . here ;of
â¢â¢his" play /'Peggy Machree" at the
Grand Opera-house. This evening, the
Majestic .will have the premiere of
a jplay . 1" by Maurice Samuels, "The
Conflict." This evening also Ye
Liberty- Playhouse in Oakland will see
the premiere of the "Sea" Wolf," a dra
matization of Jack j London's novel of
the name by; Joseph Noel. At least
bearing, -if not honor,, ln his own coun
try has been vouchsafed the : local play
wright. ;. . :
;, So far,' the plays seen both add not
ably to stage loot and are as the poles
apart, v lrish ..romance, ...musical , ro
mance, -of : the frankly ' conventional
type, .v Patrick â¢ Bidwell has : chosen as
medium' In - "Peggy; Machree." ' Easily
"Peggy Machree" : is of the best of the
class. .-It is>very handsomely what . it
purports^ to be, -a "musical" play. 'In
fact; /'Peggy .Machree". is ; better comic
opera than a- good many of the 'brand.'
There are several taking, choruses,
Michele Esposito and Clarence Lucas at
the : making, 'these' also' responsible for
some pretty, lyrics, and there is a col
lection' of old and new ; Irish ballads
that alone is worth going for. Apropos,
don't miss the laat, act. The "O'Dris
coll Aboo" i comes then, as. thrilling a
bit of ' song-making as . you are I likely
to - have = the Juck to hear." It^'made
O'Driscolls of us all : yesterday after
noon.. > r' if". : *
I As to ."Peggy | Maehree's'', ' story â tal^e a
pretty, headstrong lass of high degree, a
prankful Irish youth, a disguise or â¢ two, a
mock \ marriage that - turns out jto be a
real- one, a freak" will, a fortune-hunting
villain, an abduction, and you have most
of the materials, v Not " new, but deftly
handled by Patrick. Bidwell, who, of
course,' is Mrs. Denis O'Sullivan except it
comes to playmaking. The long arm of
coincidence Is not infrequently pulled, but
it.is so adroitly suggested that you ari in
it at the" pulling, that you perforce forgive
it.. ? Peggy, "who : when H ; she ' "\u25a0 is"- at
home : is Lady Margaret ; O'Driscoll,
on her birthday . rebels. ' at
being bothered / to- sign papers and runs
off to the county ' fair. ' Here she is | found
at. the home. of her, foster-mother, and to
have. a^ day's fun puts on her peasant
foster-sister's .gown, Ot course, the
prankful ; youth , turns up here. But the
foster-mother has been ' pursuing in \u25a0 the
female "Superman"! fashion one Alexan
der McDougall . tor} several ; years. This
happens to be" one of the wedding "days
from 'which Saroney i has â¢ escaped." "They
must have ;a -wedding,"^everybody says.
Peggy 4 and Barney Trevor (the prankful
youth) " gayly, offer themselves as victims,
Trevor's i friend ltd j play the â¢ friar. ' Mrs.
Cafferty ; (the â¢ foster-mother), however,
has a priest , on the premises/ Trevor's
friend has promised to . come -to - the
church' disguised' in one of his gowns. But
Trevor's [ friend afterward decides to go
back on the jest. -You know whyâ that
priest: is in the house/ Also, if the priest
had , not | convent ently^-so conveniently i-^
slipped out of the cottage to go : to the
church to make the mock a real mar
riage,; you would have gone in to fetch
him yourself!-, " \u0084 ;
\u25a0But, ,if- it is conventional, obvious,
."Pretty .'.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0Peggy" is also; very prettily,
likably'so. Tnere is the genuine romantic
flavor and | plenty., of . fun, and a . neat
touch 'of pathos. The characters r - are
well drawn .throughout, .that of the
Scotchman aforesaid being both new and
rattlingly effective. ' ; :
."Of .the performance- as a whole too
much can hardly, be said. ; The work of
a week only went with a spirit ' and
smoothness truly astonishing. As Barney
Trevor' Mr. O'Sullivan himself is ' most
happy. Big, -.breezy, rollicking as : the
best of his wo rk' it is, and. with a fiddle"
tucked .under i his chin, perhaps his " scene
as .the wandering, fiddler; is a little the
\u25a0best of anything Mr. O' Sullivan has; yet
done. He Is "'also') in; excellent, voice, his
songs "Widow. Malorie,','. VThe Birds Fly
South,": and i the] aforesaid "O'Driscoll
Aboo" being of the- rarest. : In the afore-,
mentioned >: fiddling \ scene . Mr. . O'Sullivan
is lolled in /capital . - fashion by v. John
O'Harai â¢ whose ; Alexander McDougall is
a Scot of : the first ; water." He Dlays âit
in 1 his owns . legs, "and a . f ace ',- that â¢ would
bfÂ» a fortune if it were not for. the legs. ; ,

There-is a clever one-act farce at the

sends you y home witu smiles Indented in
your features.. \u25a0 It" Is called 'The New
Teacher," a glimpse of a country school
in ; a quiet district, given by the Avon
Comedy Four. There Is no quietness about
the act, everything is rough-house to me
wildest extent, and -the* actions of ( the
three scholars and .: the are the
fun producers. . . ,
1 Quite as clever as . the Avon Comedy
Four, but In an altogether, different line,
were and Mrs. John Allison In their
farce . "Minnie" from Minriesotal"
Howard . and , Norta are clever talking
comedians. First they make you laugh
and then they, make you cry. It Is a very
good act, but you ' have a queer feeling
at the'end. _- \u25a0.
