MARCONI WILL HAPPY
A DAUGHTER OF ERIN
He Chooses Miss Beatrice O ' Bnen
Wedding Set for
ttie Middle of
Coming Month
Bppclal Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 20.â One of Guglielmo
Marconi's chief worries has been thp
constant variety of girls to whom the
newspapers have engaged him to be
married. Excepting the German Crown
Prince and the King of Spain the
genius of wireless telegraphy has been
betrothed by rumor oftener than any
man living. Since the report that he
was to wed Miss Alire Roosevelt,
American girls have not appeared in
the Marconi list. Last week it was the
Princess Ruspblf of Turin, the report
arising doubtless from the fact that
Marconi was- then making a Hying trip
to Turin. This week it is Miss Beatrice
O'Brien. The peculiarity about the
O'Brien rumor is that it is true.
Marconi did not intend to have the
news published, and \n hen it first came
out. he smiled at it in his usual sphinx
like fashion and in consequence it was
taken for granted that tho story was
without foundation. He admitted to
day, however, that the news is correct.
The date of the wedding has been set
for March 15.
All of the women with whom rumor,
from time to time, has coupled the
name of the wireless wizard have been
pretty girls. Miss Beatrice O'Brien is
described as a beautiful woman. More
over she can boast a royal pedigree.
She is one of the eight sisters, all
pood-looking, of the fifteenth Baron
Inchiquin and can claim descent from
the famous Irish monarch, Brian Bo
roihome. who was King of the Emerald
I Fie fr^m 1002 to 1014, when he was
slain at the head of his army at the
battle of Olontarf. His grandson. Tur
logh. King of Munster, had four sons,
whereof the third was the progenitor
of the Barons 4 Inchiquin. One of Tur
logh's descendants, Connor O'Bryan,
was King of Thormond in 1529, and it
was his brother Murrough. who. after
usurping his kingship, surrendered to
H<-nry the Eighth and was then made
Earl of Thormond for life and also
given the Inchiquin barony.
A century later the barony developed
Into an earldom, tke Â£fth holder, of
whi<*h saw it convertecf into a mar
quipate, that of Thormond, which
passed away, however, with the third
holder, while the other titles became
dormant. It was Sir Lucius O'Brien,
nfth baronet of an Irish creation of
1656, in whose favor the claim to the
Inchiquin barony was made good a lit
tle over forty years ago, and his son
was the father of Marconi's bride
elect.
She is possessed in a marked degree
of th<* pprightllness, wit and vivacity
characteristic of the Irish tempera
ment. There is a certain appropriate
ness in Marconi's choice of an Irish
lady for his wife, for his mother was
of that nationality, although as every
body knows, his father was Italian and
he was born in Italy.

Two months ago Lawson was

YOUNG IRISH WOMAN OF FAMOUS FAMILY, TO WHOM MARCONI IS EN

DEMANDS
HOME RULE
FOR ERIN
LONDON, Feb. 20.â 1n moving as an
amendment to the address in reply to
the speech from the throne the decla
ration' that "the present system of
government (of Ireland) is opposed to
the will of the Irish people," John E.
Redmond led the Irish party in the
House of Commons to-day in an attack
that contained for the Conservative
Ministry more of menace than lay in
the fiscal debate precipitated by As
quith's amendment last week. The
Redmond amendment was carefully
calculated, in fact, to undermine the
Government's majority. Interest in the
debate was intensified by a well defined
report in the lobbies, and which quick
ly spread elsewhere, that the Earl of
Dudley had resigned the Lord Lieuten
ancy of Ireland. This report, which
was given wide credence, gave heart
to the Nationalists, who made the at
tack cm the Earl of Dudley one of the
features of their speeches. Late to
night the Earl's secretary declared the
rumor unfounded.
Redmond's speech was an uncom
promising demand for home rule. He
directly and unsparingly charged in
dividual members of the Irish admin
istration with incompeteney. Both
Redmond and Moore (Irish Unionist),
who followed, made a special point of
what they termed the "shameful
treatment" of Sir Anthony MacDonnell
in connection with the now famous
difference in the Ministry over the re
form scheme.
"Ireland," he declared, "ia governed
by a bureaucracy more devoid of re
sponsibility than the bureaucracy of
Russia, which England is so fond of
denouncing."
Armed revolt, he said, would be jus
tified if a chance of success existed.
Moore, who spoke in behalf of the
Irish Unionists, was as bitter as the
Nationalist leader himself in his con
demnation of the present Government,
which, Moore declared, was held in
contempt and disgust by a million and
a quarter of loyalists who have been
driven to revolt by the policy of glam
or and promise without performance.
Wyndham, Chief Secretary for Ire
land, delivered a straightforward ex
planation of how the unfortunate mis
understandings involving MacDonnell
arose. In doing so. he paid a splendid
tribute to Sir Anthony MacDonnell,
Vho, he said, was asked to accept the
post of Under Secretary, not in the
capacity of an underling, but as a
wise and able colleague. Wyndham
said he had given MacDonnell a free
Jjand to <ttal with the situation. They

WEST POINT, N. V., Feb. 20.
The cadets saw to-day a demonstra

who accompanied two wrestlers to the

Professor Tomito Loki and his as

had discussed the situation together.
He knew that MacDonnell and Lord
Dunraven been considering a re
form scheme, but he did not know all
the terms of their plan. "Wyndham
said:
"1 had often discussed reforms with
MacDonnell, who with his Indian ex
periences found analogies between my
ideas and ideas he had formed in In
dia. Here came the first soiirce of se
rious misunderstanding. I, with a
colossal ignorance of Indian affairs,
did not know that a semi-elective coun
cil exists in India, and therefore it
never occurred to me in my conver
sations with MacDonnell that he had
in mind any board partially elected
as part of the reforms of which
I approved. If I had thought he had
any such idea I would have told him
that it was, in my judgment, quite im
practicable."
Wyndham said he was absent for a
holiday when the revolutionary scheme
was published, and that, when he re
turned, without consulting MacDon
nell, he wrote to the papers denouncing
the elective council feature. Wynd
ham said the Cabinet never had doubt
ed MacDonnell's loyalty, but simply
had recorded itself as not approving
the action of an Under Secretary, who
had approved of a scheme without
first submitting it to his chief. Wynd
ham admitted that MacDonnell per
haps was justified in taking his ap
proval for granted.
The night session was taken up by
T. W. Russell, Winston Churchill and
others, who bitterly aqsailed the Gov
ernment's management of Irish affairs
and the Earl of Dudley's administra
tion.

Disaster Occurs at the Birmingham

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Feb. 20.â 8y
an explosion in the Virginia mine,
about eighteen miles southwest of
Birmingham, at 4 o'clock this after
noon, between 110 and 135 union min
ers were entombed, and it is believed
that the entire number suffered an
awful death. Scores of vigorous res
cuers are at work digging into the
mine to relieve their friends and com
rades on the inside.
The explosion is believed to have
been caused by an accumulation of
gas, although the mine has heretofore
been noted for beiner entirely free from
dust. It is believed that, as the entire
quota has probably been killed, the de
tails of the cause of the disaster will
never be known.
The camp is almost isolated from the
rest of the world, as there is no tele
phone station at Virginia and the only
wire running to the place is a dt&
patched wire of the Birmingham Min
eral Railway, on which Virginia is \o
cated.
The class of miners employed was
the best in the district and all be
longed to the United Mine 'Workers of
America. Since tha strike has been
on in the Birmingham district many of
the most industrious and thrifty min
ers of Pratt City and other important
mift+nsr points have removed to- the
Virginia mines, so that the mines were
being worked to their full capacity by
the most skilled miners in the com
munity.
Relief trains with surgeons and
workmen were dispatched from both
Birmingham and Bessemer as soon as
the news of the disaster was received.
They began the work of succor before
6 o'clock, but at midnight had not dug
half way through the mass of debris.
It i^ believed that it will be 10 o'clock
to-morrow before the interior of the
stope is reached.
The stoDes are well arranged, and
there has never been the least trouble
in the mines before. They are owned
by the Alabama Steel and Wire Com

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 20.â Less than
thirty stockholders of the Ladue Gold
Mining Company of the Yukon, hold
ing proxies for 10,000 more stockhold
ers, met to-day in Jersey City, and
after making threats to sue several
prominent men once identified with the
company, appointed a committee to
confer with the new officers of the
company when elected and report to
the stockholders on April 21.
The company was organized in the
boom days of the Klondike by the late
Ladue. formerly of Plattsburg, N. V.,
one of the founders of Dawson City
and its first Mayor. It was capitalized
at $5,000,000 and among the original di
rectors whom Ladue interested in his
project were Senator Depew. Thomas
C. James, Smith Weed, W. J. Arkell
and John Carstensen. formerly con
troller of the New York Central and
Hudson River Railroad. None of these
men are now on the board and none of
them attended to-day's meeting aa
stockholders.
It is alleged by many of the stock
holders that the company, instead of
owning valuable mining property, has
only a vast tract of valueless Alaska
land and a few cheap buildings. They
state that they invested in the com
pany, relying upon the names of De
pew and others as a guarantee of the
honesty of the enterprise. It Is charged
that the only dividen* ever paid by
the company was not paid from the
earnings, but from tfce capital. For all
these reasons these stockholders think
that the original directors, including
Senator Dapew, can be legally and
equitably called upon to make good
their losses.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21. 1905.
WEBER'S COUNSEL MAKES
FINAL PLEA TO JURY
Cfopuence of Johnson Is Brought to
Aid of Accused Youth.
Webb Defends Mrs. Snowden
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Feb. 20.â "1t seems to me
that I can hear the angel voice of
Mary Weber calling out to this Jury,
Spare my first born, spare him who
caused me my first pain and my first
joy. Adolph never hurt me; do not
kill an innocent boy." " These were
the words with which Attorney John
son closed the argument for the de
fense in the Weber case this afternoon.
They were delivered in a most dra
matic manner.
For a minute or two after their ut
terance a great hush filled the court
room. Adolph sat unmoved. His
manner was as stolid as usual. After
a short recess Attorney General Webb
began the closing argument for the i
prosecution. For an hour Webb talked, j
his remarks being listened to with !
great interest. I
The crowd that attended to-day's
session of the court was much larger
than usual. The majority of the spec- i
tators were women. They began ar- ;
niving at 8 o'clock this morning. Many
of the women wore white dresses and I
large picture hats, giving the court- |
room the appearance of a theater â 
rather than a tribunal where a life was j
at stake.
Attorney Johnson resumed his argu- i
merit at 9 o'clock by attacking Pawn- I
broker Carr, whom he described as a j
second Fagin.
Charles H. Reimer, the detective
bfred by the prosecution, also came
in for a scoring at Johnson's hands, j
as did District Attorney Robinson.
Johnson said:
SCORES PROSECUTION.
When Gf>nÂ«?rKl Webb made his opening state
ment for the prusvoutlon, Carr, and his testl-
RioB) ami lii> revolver were kept in thr back
ground. They were sprung on the defense
When ih<- prosecution thought the case was so
far along that it would be Impossible for us
t'. Introduce, evidence to Impeach such testi- |
monr. We will, however, leave Carr to the
tender mercies of the orimirinl courts of San
Francisco. This revolver is a bis link In this
chain of circumstantial evidence. Without
testimony we would have asked his
Honor for a nonsuit.
Johnson here introduced a time-card
about two feet square. -upon which was
printed a memorandum of the time of
the events in which the defendant par
ticipated between the hours of 5:30 and j
7:42 on the night the Wehers were mur- :
dered. One of these cards was pinned !
upon the wall where all the spectators J
would see it and duplicates were hand- j
ed to the jury. Referring to this card
Johnson said:
Judging by tne statements made by the
prosecution and according to th*> various times
as taken by them. I say it is an utter impos
sibility for the defendant to have committed
the* murders. You will not* that at 5:30 the
family was alive and well, according to the
wstmimy of little Francis Snnwden. You
will aIRO notice that at 6 o'clock Zoe M. !
Ilagi r heard ihc piano playing. Mrs. A. Rech- |
eninacher stated oa the witness stand that she
heard Bertha Web-r playing the piano about
p:SP. According to the testimony of May
Clark. Adolph passed her house In Brewery
lpne somewhere between fi:."!0 and 6:40. This
testimony alone precludes the possibility of the
defendant having committed this hideoun
crime. I believe some ol this testimony to be
perjured testimony, and upon this presump
tion it would be judicial murder to hang that
boy. It would be a stain upon the county of
Placer.
Attorney R"binÂ«!on and Sheriff Keen'a did
winnK in lockinK Adolph Weber in r room the
'lav lfter the tragedy and forcing a state
ment from him. They told the defendant that
the statement would not be used against him,
aid the boy having no one to advise him, made
a voluntary statement of all he knew about
t*ie terrible crime. His attorneys were obliged
tn almost kick the door down before Sheriff
Keei.a would let them in. This boy has been
confined in Jail more than three months, and !
the Sheriff has allowed people to go in right
and left. It was r.o doubt the intention of
nnnie of thesÂ» persons to try and make Weber
â¢ay (something. They hoped to catch him in j
ar. untruth. But he said nothing, for he had |
nothing more to say. He was like Dreyfus; |
he knew ho was innocent.
SPEAKS OF REVOLVER.
Now I come to the weapon found in the
Weiv-r barn. It was never placed there by
the defendant, but by seme one influenced by
hut*, or money. Clarence Geear did not see
the hair on that revolver. It took the micro
scopic eye of Detective Relmer to Bee that
hair, assisted by the equally microscopic and
distended eye of fnder Sheriff May. Why, if
the defendant put the revolver in that barn
he would have been the biggest fool on earth.
Nnw. It is not nil impossible that this hor
rible deed was done by some person In that
house. Julius Weber was a man of violent
te-nper. He mlsrht have done it. I don't say
he did. He could have shot the mother, daugh
ter and little boy in a- fit of anger, and then
realizing the enormity of the crime killed
h'nisf-lf. Hefore killing himselT he could have
set fire to the house; he could then have shot
himself In the bathroom and dropped the pistol
into the cesspool.
Now jurymen, remember that this case reet*
on circumstantial evidence. To-night when
you are home alone and with your God, think
this matter well over. As I am standing here
before you, I think I can almost hear the
4ngiÂ»l voice of little Earl saying to yon:
"Dolphy nevtr hurt me, spare his Ufa." I
can almost hean the voice of sweet Bertha
saying. â¢'Dolphy did not hurt me, spare him."
I can hear the gruff voice of the stern father
saying, "It was not Adolph who did this deed,"
ana last of all I can hear the gentle voice of
his mother saying, "Spare my first born; spare
him who. caused me my first pain and Joy.
Adolph never hurt me; do not kill an Innocent
boy."
General Webb opened the argument
for the prosecution shortly after 3
o'clock. He scored Attorney Johnson
for his attack on the District Attor
ney, Sheriff Keena and Under Sheriff
May. AM these men, he said, were
honest, reliable and trustworthy. They
were known to be so throughout this
whole county or wherever they had
ever been. Continuing, Webb said:
District Attorney Robinson came to me and
urged me to come into this case, and that Is
the reason I am here. I have known Johnson
fo- many y<ars. I have always admired him
for his brilliant attainments, for his magnifi
cent powers, his eloquence, his logic Hnd his
fairness. I admired him all along In this case,
up to the point, when, holding the weapon that
was found in the Weber barn up before the
Jury, he stated that he did not believe the
revolver had been put there by Adolph Weber
When I heard him say that he "would not
if he were a Juror, convict a man on cir
cumstantial evidence," I could not believe my
own errÂ«.
DEFENDS MRS. SXOWDEX.
Duriug his eleven hours' recital he has
I chosen to use the license of a lawyer to ques
tion the Integrity of men in this prosecution
that he would not dare use outside of a court
room. If the prosecution had for one ln
' stant even thought of getting testimony of
the kind that Attorney Johnson has hinted
â  at, and if they had got men who would swear
i to such an ouirngeous proceeding, they might
j possibly have got men who would have sworn
that they "saw the defendant coming out of the
i burning Weber residence Immediately after the
commission of the crime with a smoking re
v. Her still In his grasp. Why. Jurynvn. It is
preposterous to think for ore second that any
ol these men connected with the prosecution
; would swear away the life of an innocent boy.
Court adjourned at E o'clock, and at
| the request of General Webb and with
the approval of the Jury It reconvened
at 7 o'-clock. A great number of spec
| tators remained in their seats and had
| their dinners sent to them.
General Webb spoke for two hours
'at the night session. He defended Mrs.
: Snowden in the attack that Attorney
Johnson made on her and stated that
j Adolph could will his money coming
from the estate to any. one he chose.
1 This would make Mrs. Snowden's
chances very remote. The defendant
heartily laughed at thi .:. statement.
When court opened at 7 to-night
everybody connected with the case was
present except the defendant's attor
neys. Judge Prewett refused to allow
the case to proceed until one of them
should appear. After waiting ten min
utes the court ordered the Sheriff to
bring one of the lawyers into court.
Only one, Ben Tabor, could be found.
Attorneys Johnson, Pullen or Tut
tle did not appear. Much comment was
caused by this extraordinary action of
the attorneys, and it was the subject
of criticism throughout the town to
night. Tabor twice raised objections
to some of Webb's statements and was
each time overruled.
BAKER ASSAILS
THE PRESIDENT
Eccentric Congressman Ex
cited Over Message of Con
dolence Sent to Kussia
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â 1n the
House to-day Baker, the eccentric
member from New York, condemned
President Roosevelt for sending to the
Russian Government a message of
sympathy on account of the assassina
tion of Grand Duke Serglus.
"I declare," he vehemently re
marked, "that the American people are
not shocked by the killing of Grand
Duke Sergius."
The killing of Grand Duke Serglus,
he declared, was but 'an effort of the
Russian people to overcome the ty
ranny that had suppressed them."
General applause was accorded Mad
dox of Georgia when he declared that
the Democratic side of the House did
not approve "of this damnable assas
sination." He said the Democrats be
lieved in fair rights.
"We do not believe in slaughter," he
said, "and we do not believe in this
business which caused the slaughter
of the Grand Duke Sergius."
In the course of his remarks Baker
referred to the refusal of the House to
adjourn out of respect to the Russians
killed on the streets of St. Petersburg
on January 22.
With particular reference to this
subject Grosvenor of Ohio was bitter
in his criticism of Baker. Baker's ac
tion he declared to have been unpre
cedented. Had adjournment been' tak
en, he said, it would have been a
meaningless and stupid exhibition of
ignorance. The House and the 'world
knew that the American Congress did
r>ot sympathize with riot and unneces
sary bloodshed. There was no doubt a
strong critical opinion of the acts
there, but he said no intelligent man
would suggest that Congress express
an opinion on the subject. Grosvenor
ventured the assertion, and received
liberal applause in doing so, that if a
vote of condemnation of the President
was offered by any resolution of Baker
it would not get a vote except the lat
ter's own.
The House at this point returned to
consideration of the naval bill and the
incident was believed to have been
closed, but Baker unexpectedly inter
jected himself into the debate to read
a resolution declaring it to be the sense
of the House that the President did
not express the will of the American
people in sending a message of con
dolence to the Russian Government.
Baker excitedly asserted that he had
been told that If he introduced the
resolution a motion would be made to
expel him from the House. Rushing
down the aisle and waving the re^sp
lution in his hand he deposited it in
the box provided for such measures
and defied any one to make a motion
to expel him.
"Make it now," he shouted. "Expel, :
expel, expel; I tell you. Introduce your
motion to expel."
The House overlooked Baker and
continued its discussion of the naval
bill.

COMPLAINT
IS SERVED
ON WITTMAN
Police Board Sets Forth in
Specific Form Charges of
Incompetency and Neglect
of Duty Against Chief
CONGRESSMAN KAHN
TO BE HIS ATTORNEY
Accused Is Eager for Trial
Friday Night, but Secre
tary Boyne Thinks Case
Cannot Be Beached Then
â¦
The Police Commissioners required
much time to deliberate on formulat
ing the charges against Chief of Police
Wittman of incompetency and neglect
of duty and not till 9 o'clock last night
were they ready for service. The sus
pended Chief was found at his home,
1231 Taylor street, at 10 o'clock, and
the chafing of impatience to know just
what allegations he must answer was
at last relieved when the papers were
served.
It was Wednesday night that the
commission resolved to make accusa
tion against Wittman because he had
failed to suppress gambling in China
town, but he was kept waiting for the
charges in specified form as long as
was allowed the board without invad
ing his charter right to five days in
which to prepare his defense, the trial
being set for next Friday night.
Chief Wittman expressed eagerness
yesterday to see the charges. He has
called at headquarters every day since
Wednesday night, asking Secretary
Boyne whether the charges were ready.
"I should like to have the charges
served as early as possible," declared
Wittman yesterday, "so I can find out
just where I am at and what I must
make answer to. I want to go to
trial as soon as possible. I am ready
now and at no time shall ask for a
continuance. Even if the board does
not serve in time to allow me the five
days I am entitled to, I shall waive
any right to a delay. I want to go
ahead Friday night.' Congressman
Julius Kahn 1s the chief's attorney.
But Secretary Boyne said he could
not see how the board could take up
the Wittman case on Friday evening
because of the large amount of busi
ness on the calendar ahead of it.
As to the report that the commission
could not dismiss Wittman from the
department, but had only the authority
to oust him from the command of the
force, the Chief gave it as his opinion
that the board has full authority to
sever his connection with the force
altogether.
"It is true that I was simply taken
from the rank of captain and made
chief," he explained, "without any
resignation or other formal action that
would put me outside the pale of the
regulations as to permanency of ser
vice. But the Commissioners certainly
have the right to dismiss me alto-^
gether under the charges of ineom-'
petency, if they choose to do so."
The following are the charges pf the
commission against Chief Wittman:
INCOSIPETEXCY ALLEGED.
Now comes J George Boyne. secretary of
the Board of Police Commissioners of the city
and county of San Francisco, and charges that
George W. Wittman. .Chief of Police of said
c-lty and county of San Francisco, is and at
all the times hereinafter mentioned was in
competent to perform the duties of the office
of Chief of Police of said city and county
and specifies the following acts and conduct as
the basis of such charge of incompetency. to
v.-it:
That during all the times herein mentioned
said George W. Wittman was and still is the
duly elected, qualified Chief of Police of the
city and county of San Francisco and as such
Chief of Police had sole and exclusive control
and direction of the police officers and mem
bers of the police department assigned to duty
In that part of the city and county of San
Franclaoo known as Chinatown, which is more
Bijxticularly bounded and described as follows:
On the north by Paciflc street, on the south
by Sacramento street, on the west by Stockton
street, and on the east by Kearny street.
And more particularly that Jie was in the
sole and exclusive control of a certain squad
or police consisting of five police officers and
one sergeant of police specially detailed In
said "Chinatown" to prevent and to suppress
unlawful gambling In Chinatown Rnd especially
tc, prevent and suppress the playing of the
game of fantan and other gambling games.
That said squad of police including said
officers and sergeant operated under the ex
clusive, sole and direct authority, control and
direction of said George W. Wittman. Chief
of Police.
GAMES RAN FREELY.
That from the 7th day of November, 1904.
to and including the 29th day of November,
1904. there were in active operation in said
Chinatown many open and notorious gambling
places wherein said unlawful game of fantan
and other unlawful games were operated and
conducted and which places were openly and
notoriously resorted to during all of said time
for the purpose of gambling and of playing
said unlawful game of fantan and o.her un
lawful games.
That such gambling places were conducted
and maintained openly, notoriously, and with
the knowledge of the sergeant of police and
police officers detailed in Chinatown as afore
said.
That as such Chief of Police It was the duty
of 3aid George W. Wittman to know the con
ditions existing with reference to said gam
bling places in Chinatown during such period
and it was his duty to exercise proper super
vision over the same and over the police offi
cers and sergeant detailed for duty in that
section of the city, and to suppress and pre

WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â 1n the
< cases of Flanigan vs. Sierra County ,
and Wheeler vs. Plumas County the
Supreme Court of the United States
held that when the Legislature of Cal- !
lfornia repealed the act authorizing
county boards in that State to re
quire a license from all persons doing
bMtom within their respective areas,
it also repeals the licenses imposed
under the act. This decision reverses
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. In Flanigan's case
$2500 as license fee on sheep was In
volved and he waa relieved from pay
ment.
Chief Justice Fuller handed down the
decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States in the case of the North
ern Pacific Railway Company vs. Ely,
reversing the decision of the Supreme
Court of the State of Washington. The
proceeding was one of many institut 1
ed by the railroad company to quiet
title to its right of way. The decision
was favorable to Ely.
The Supreme Court overruled the de
cision of the United States District
Court of Montana in the case of the
United States vs. the Montana Lumber
and Manufacturing Company and the
Northern Pacific Railway Company, in
which it was held that the Govern
ment could not enforce penalties for
timber cut on unsurveyed public land.
The validity of the Kansas anti-trust
law was to-day upheld by the Supreme
Court of the United States in an opin
ion by Justice Brewer in the case of
Edmund J. Smiley, plaintiff in error,
vs. the State of Kansas. Smiley in
1900 was secretary of the State Grain
Dealers' Association, and the allega
tion in this case was that he organ
ized the wheat dealers in the town
of Blsnn, Rush County, into a trust
to control the price of wheat at that
place. The Supreme Court of the State
sustained the prosecution against him
and Justice Brewer's opinion upholds
that verdict. He based his decision on
the ground that the law was in har
mony with the power of the State to
control its own police affairs "and there
fore not antagonistic to the Federal
constitution.

"From the evidence before Ã¼b, after
careful deliberation, we respectfully
eubmlt the following findings:
"Firstâ That the appointment of the
Senate Committee on " Commissions
and Retrenchment and the placing of
Senators Rmmons, French, Bunkers
and Wright thereon came about in
the due and ordinary course of Senate
organization and without ulterior mo
tive, particularly as to Hon. AJden An
derson, Lieutenant Governor, who
made such appointments in entire
good faith and uninfluenced by any
other motive than a most equitable and
economic apportionment of committee
work, and that the San Francisco Ex
miner had no part in the 'creation or
Institution of said committee or the ap
pointment of said Senators thereon.
Second â That no agreement existed whereby
Senator Bunkers wae to receive a municipal
appointment or other preferment if he 'would
do his utmost against tbe Continental Building
*r<l Loan Aaaoclation.
Thirdâ That the San Francisco Examiner,
through Its representatives, actively assisted
said committee in. preparing for an Investiga
tion of the affairs of the Continental Building
an.; Loan Association by advising with Senator
French, a member of said committee, as to
the witnesses to be eubpened and furnishing
an expert to assist in said investigation.
Fourth That on the 24tn day -of January,

the interests of the Phoenix Savings, Building
acd . an Association, and the Renters' Build -
Ing and Loan Association, two corporations

PHYSICIANS EVERYWHERE
Know the ValuÂ£ of Pyramid Pile Core.
"Gratitude alone prompts me to tes-
tify to the efficacy of Pyramid Pile
Cure. Last March I bought a dollar
package at the drug store, which cured
me of bleeding piles, and I was a suf-
ferer from them for eight years; but I
had not been troubled with them since,
until last September, when I gave birth
to a baby girl and after that I had a
very severe case of protruding piles,
which a trained nurse said was the
worst case the ever saw and my doc-
tor told me to get Pyramid Pile Cure
again which I did and was completely
cured in three days. I have not had
piles of any kind since and it is all
owing to this wonderful remedy. My
nurse took a box, which I was glad
to be able to give her. for I know she
v.ill be able to help lots of suffering
people whom I could never r see or
know.
"I recommend 'Pyramids' wherever I
know of any one suffering as I did. It
gjves me great pleasure to be able to
E ay lam entirely cured, which my doc-
tor says is true. I say God bless Pyra-
mid Pile Cure." Fr^m a former great
sufferer, Mrs. F. Ancott. 1206 Unity
street.'. Frankford, Philadelphia, Pa.
This remedy, which is "sold by drug-
gists generally, in 50-cent and $1 pack-
ages, is in a suppository form, is ap-
plied directly to the parts affected and
performs its work quietly and pain-
lessly. Its value is evidenced by the
testimony given above and we urge all
Eufferers to buy a package now and
give it a trial "to-night/ Accept no
substitutes and remember that there is
no remedy "just as -<'<1." A little
book on the Cause and Cure of Piles is
published by â¢he Pyramid Drug Com-
pany. Marshall. Mich., and will be sent !
tree to any address. ,
gENATORS Bunkers, French, Wright and Emmons sold their
honor for $3 each. Such is the verdict of the special committee
appointed by the Senate to investigate the charges of bribery brought
against these four Senators by William Corbin. The findings of
the committee were made public yesterday in a report made to
the members of the Senate in which it is declared that the four
Senators have brought disgrace upon the Legislature of the State of
California and should be punished by expulsion from their seats
in the Senate. It will require a two-thirds vote of the upper
house to expel the Senators. Action on J;he report was deferred
until Thursday, but it is believed that the committee's recom
mendation will be carried out, notwithstanding that the accused
men will make a hard fight to prevent the disgrace.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY SEYMOUR
ATTACKS DEFENSE OF BOODLERS
Official Cites Authorities Sustaining the Validity
of Indictments Against Senators,
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 20â District
Attorney Seymour argued before Supe
rior Judge Hart this morning in reply
to ex-Senator Morehouse's points in
favor of the demurrer to the indict
ment returned against the four bood
ling Senators â Emmons, French,
Wright and Bunkers.
"The defense has laid much stress
upon the importance of this case," said
Seymour. "The prosecution is neither
overwhelmed nor carried away with
the importance of it. There have been
before this court causes of more grave
import, though probably not attracting
so wide public attention as this one.
Opposing counsel may know at the
outset that the prosecution will pro
ceed with the utmost fairness and
with the same desire to meet only the
demands of Justice that would prevail
in any other case it had to deal with."
Th^ District Attorney then took up
the contention of the defense that as
bribery was a statutory on>nse in Cal
ifornia, decisions of other States where
the common law covered it could not
be considered. "If bribery under the
some of the testimony was to the ef
fect that he had protested to Jordan
that the roll he received was $50 short,
Senator Belshaw said:
â¢Jordan testified that he gave Bun
kers $350. We believe that he did; that
the roll was not short."
"Well, the end has come," said one
of the San Francisco delegation. "We
stood by the accused in favor of giv
ing them the right to be sworn, but
we can go no further. We have fol
lowed them to the end of the wharf,
l.ut we will not jump overboard for
them. We have ourselves to look out
for."
So it is that the now condemned
bribers are being deserted by their last
defenders. When it comes to the vote
they will have but very few friends in
court. Their expulsion will come next
Thursday, and disgraced forever, they
will turn from the Capitol to othrr
paths of endeavor, honest or dishonest,
as they choose, if, indeed, the doors
of the penitentiary do not close upon
them.
ACCUSED DESERTED.
There was a scurrying this after
noon on the part of the disgraced Sen
ators to rake uv sufficient force to
prevent them from being expelled when
the vote on the committee report is
called next Thursday, but they were
not successful. From now on till the
final day they will use every influence
they possess to gain votes, only ten
besides their own being necessary to
save them. It requires a two-thirds
vjte to expel a member of the Senate.
A careful canvass was made this
afternoon by legislators that know
pretty well the temper of the lower
house, and they say the boodlers will
be able to secure only five votes out
side of their own if, indeed, these five
do not lose their nerve at the last mo
ment and decide not to run the risk of
going to their political graves with the
accused. There is no question, how
ever, but that the vote will be pre
ceded by a v. arm dfbat^, hut many
members of the upper house have been
known to talk one way and vote
another when they saw the odds were
against them. It is the general opin
ion that this system will prevail when
Thursday comes and that some of
those that enter most actively into the
debate on behalf of the boodlers will
give way when they see the avalanche
approaching and vote with the major
ity to oxpel the men that have dishon
ored themselves and cast a reflection
upon the entire Senate.
STATE EXPENSES HEAVY.
Ways and Means Committee Makes
Report on Appropriation Bills.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 2 0. â After
several weeks' work the Ways and
Mean? Committee presented the gen
eral appropriation bill to the Assem
bly Just before adjournment late this
afternoon. The measure was ordered
printed in the Journal at the request
of Chairman Stanton of the commit
tee and was made a special order for
next Thursday night. The total
amount of the bill is, in round num
bers, 87.500,000, exceeding the Con
troller's estimate by nearly $500,000.
ParticularTy noticeable in the bill
is the large appropriation that has
been made for the maintenance of
San Quentin penitentiary. The
amount set aside for running expenses
for this institution is $396,352, as
against $60,000 given for support two
years ago, and $207,920, as against
$120,000 for salaries two years ago.
The reason given for the increase is
that instead of allowing the Prison
Board to handle the funds accruing
from the sale of jute bags the sums
will be turned over to the State treas
ury.
The University of California is giv
en $200,000, its full share, which is
in excess of the constitutional tax levy
of 2 cents.
An entirely new item appropriates
1 12,000 for the support and salaries of
officials and employes of the proposed
State Hospital for Insane Convicts.
The item of the State's portion of
the salaries of Superior Court Judges
was s^t at $350,000. an increase of
$20,500 over the budget of two years
ago.

common law is different from bribery
under the statute, then the contention
of the defense is sound." the District
Attorney said, "but if, as the prosecu
tion contends, bribery under the stat
ute is the same as bribery under the
common law, then the stand of the de
fense is not good."
After speaking in support of his po
sition on this point, Seymour said?
"Bribery under the common law and
under the statiites being one and the
same thing, then the d n cisions of those
States where the common law prevails
shall be taken as lights to guide your
honor.
"Any man who accepts any fee to
influence his vote, whether there is
anything before the House or not, Is
guilty of bribery. If I am the owner
of a street railway in Sacramento and
give some member of a board $5000 to
influence his vote on any matter that
may come up, that is bribery.
"The next proposition of the defense
is that the Legislature has no power
to investigate the affairs of private
corporations. It is a matter of com
mon knowledge that the Legislative
quarters was entirely eliminated and
several thousands were omitted from
the brigade headquarters appropria
tion. Armory rents and other ex
penses of the National- Guard were cut
from $102,000 to $75,000. Traveling
expenses of the officers of the guard
suffered the loss of a quarter of the
sum askod for, while the Ways and
Ifefttu Committee believed that $15,
000 was enough to set aside for gen
eral encampments instead of the $20,
000 asked for.
TRADING STAMP BIIX.
Assembly Passes Measure Declaring
Ajjainst Counon System.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 20.â The AsÂ»
sembly this morning passed Keane's
â¢Senate bill, identical with that of
Cophlan in the lower house, prohibit
ing the use of trading stamps. Cogh
lan in explaining the measure to the
Assembly said: "Commercialism is at
once the blessing and bane of the
age. We have mighty ships bringing
to our shores the wealth of the Orient
and railroads carrying across the des
erts the goods of the East, and pros
perity is with us. But out of this great
prosperity we see springing up a class
of men who do not work, but pre\
upon the credulity of the public. It
is at thorn this bill is aimed. From
the retail tradesmen of San Francisco
alone $4 SO. OOO is taken every year by
this illegitimate scheme."
TreadweU said the bill should have
been referred to the Judiciary Com
mittee for final inspection, as in other

RIBL.E IX SCHOOLS.
Judiciary Committee Reports Against
Bill Dealing With Good Book.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 20.â The As
sembly Judiciary Committee to-da>
reported adversely upon McCartney's
amendment to an educational section
of the Political Code providing that
branch of our Government is fre
quently called upon to exercise powers
of a quasi-judicial nature. The Senate
is exercising such powers in investi
gating these defendants.
"We claim that a Legislature may
Investigate any corporation or indi
vidual for the purpose of obtaining
information upon which to base legis
lation."
Seymour also cited the celebrated
Keeler bribery case in New York, in
which the Supreme Court of that State
held that the Legislature had power
to hold Investigations into the affairs
of private corporations and individ
uals.
Morehouse devoted two hours to an
swerjng the District Attorney. He
said the cases cited by that official did
not apply to this State.
Judge Hart said at the conclusion
of the argument that he wanted two
or three days in which to consider the
case. Asked by Morehouse to fix a
definite date upon which it would
render a decision, the court announced
that it would decide the matter next
Saturday morning at 10 o'clock.
nothing in the section amended shall
be deemed to prohibit the use of the
Bible in public schools. The main
reason given by the committee for the
adverse report is that the amendment
even granting that the Bible shall be
used in the public schools, is not di
rect enough, and leaves a ground for
endlps<? discussion betwen those who
waiit the Scriptures a part of the
curriculum and those who do not
neither providing for nor against their
nse.

quest of citizens of Menlo Park that is

their crossing by vehicles safe.

INDULGES AT BANQUET
Testimony Offered in the
â¢ Divorce Case to Show Good
Character of His Wife
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Feb. 20.â The
trial of the Cody divorce case was re
sumed in the District Court to-day.
Dr. C. L. Gillam of Cody, Wyo., first
gave testimony for the plaintiff. Col
onel William F. Cody. He accompanied
Colonel and Mrs. Cody and a large
party on a hunting trip in Big Horn
County in 1899. On that trip, he testi
fied, he heard Mrs. Cody say that her
husband had wanted her to accompany
him to Europe, but that she "would
not go anywhere with the old repro
bate."
Charles F. Iddings, a merchant of
North Platte, Neb., was called for the
defense. He said Mrs. Cody was al
ways very kind and considerate with
her husband and their guests. In re
ply to a question, Iddings said, "I con
sider Mrs. ("ody a better business
manager than her husband."
Arthur McNamara, president of the
First National Bank of North Platte,
Neb., corroborated Iddings with refer
ence to the character of Mrs. Cody.
Regarding the celebrated banquet In
North Platte in the fall of 1903 in
honor of Buffalo Bill's return to his
home. Banker McNamara testified that
it was whisky and not poison tlfat
made Colonel Cody sick on that occa
sion. He said that Buffalo Bill was
so under the influence of liquor that
he was unable to make the speech he
expected to deliver. McNamara added
that Cody asked for a cup of coffee
during the banquet, and that the chef,
thinking the guest of honor needed a
"bracer," gave him some whisky in a
teacup.
F. E. Bullard, an employe of the
Union Pacific at North Platte, corrob
orated Iddings and McNamara with
reference to the good character of Mrs.
Cody and stated that Mrs. Cody ap
peared to be solicitous for her hus
band's safety and welfare when he was
drinking. This witness testified that
Mrs. Cody educated and took care of
the children, and that Cody would not
have anything to do with them.

and fraternal associates are worried
about Munce, who has been absent
from his smithy at Third and Clay
struts since last Monday. But Mrs.
Munce, who lives at 966 East Six
teenth street, declares she does not
share the fears of her husband's
friends. In fact, Mrs. Munce an
nounces that her husband hap not dis
appeared.
Members of a Knights of Pythias
lodge of which Munce is treasurer
went to the police Wednesday and an
nounced that he was missing, his ab
sence having previously been reported
by â  patrolman. They had traced him
as far as a poker game in a Washing,
ton-street saloon Monday night, but
nfter that lost track of their man. It
is said by the police that during the
game Munce gave personal checks,
which later were dishonored, because
the funds were deposited to the joint
account of Munce and his wife. Con
tinuing their inquiry, with police as
sistance, the lodge members were ad
vised to-day that Munce was only
temporarily out of the city. Munce
according to his wife, went to Stock
ton and is now headed down the San
Joaquln Valley on a business trip.

in charge of F. W. Sonderleiter, ad
ministrator of Rowland's estate. The
relatives until last night had kept
far away from the place, around which
hovered such grewsome recollections.
For some reason, not yet explained,
Warren Rowland and his companions
went there yesterday and it is charged
by the brother George, prepared to
remove a number of household articles.
The arrests followed and disclosed
the existence of a family feud which
had been on for a long time among
the children before the death of the
mother and father. Both Rowland and
his wife had each been married before
and each had children by other part
ners. The feeling that existed was ac
centuated after the deaths. It was
manifested when separate funerals of
the husband and the wife were held.
Rowland's song buried him In Oak
land, while Mrs. Rowland's body was
interred under her children's direction
at Byron, her parents' home.
WANTS WIRES
PUT IN GROUND
Finance Committee Investi
gates Delay in Removal
of Many Unsightly Poles
The Supervisors' Finance Commit
tee yesterday began an investigation
into the delay in putting the wires be
longing to the city underground.
Chief Hewitt of the Department of
Electricity made the rather startling
admission that no wires had as yet
been placed underground in districts
1 and 2, comprising the downtown
section, although he had promised
that such work would be completed
two years ago. Hewitt ascribed as the
reason for the delay that a switch
board had not yet been constructed.
He further excused the dilatory tac
tics of his department by saying that
the appropriation made for the work
was inadequate, when he was cut
short by Brandenstein, who said:
"Now, that is not so. It has been
said that you had 5250,000 to spend."
"That is not true," retorted Hewitt.
"My impression is that it was $120,
000."
Hewitt then agreed to prepare a de
tailed statement showing the total
amount received for underground con
struction, the moneys actually ex
pended for the work and other data
pertaining to the 1 subject under inves
tigation. Brandenstein then pinned
Hewitt down as to the date when the
underground work in district No. 3
will be completed.
"If we are allowed to use our en
tire allowance of $35,000," said Hew
itt, "we will complete it on June 30,
1905. We will have to use $1988 95
for work on Fourth street, and that
may delay us one month."
The amended ordinance regulating
the placing of poles and electrical
wires so as to require a permit to be
issued by the Board of Works as well
as the Department of Electricity was
referred to the joint Committee on Ju
diciary and Electricity. Supervisor
Braunhart oiled attention to the ne
cessity of some constructive legisla
tion to compel the removal of unsight
ly poles.
"The promiscuous way that poles
are being erected is an outrage,'" said
Boxton, "and I hope that restrictions
will be put upon the companies re
sponsible for their erection. It is a
fact that the dirt taken up to make
room for poles has not been removed
in some places for months."
The committee received a communi
cation from the Mayor that Commis
sioner of Works Maestretti had agreed
to file a now, official bond. The sure
ty company on his old bond gave no
tice that it desired to withdraw there
from, without, however, offering to re
turn the balance of the premium,
which had been paid in advance. The
committee decided that it had no
power to take any further action to
compel the immediate furnishing of
another bond.
The committee referred the peti
tion of Mahoney Bros, for the return
of $670 deposited as fees for the use
of streets for building purposes to the
Board of Works, with a request that
the money be returned. The coin is
part of the $8000 embezzled by ex-
Cashier W. J. White, who absconded.
The sum of $450 was allowed out
of the urgent fund for sanitary work
in Chinatown up to March 1 next. The
same fund will be drawn upon to the
extent of $200 in addition to the $750
appropriated for the safety station at
Market and Powell streets and $1750
for the maintenance of the new port
able sterilizer.
The committee decided to make
temporary repairs to the Fourth
street bridge, which is in a dangerous
condition. The sum of $1000 was set
aside out of the urgent fund for the
purpose. Engineer Lane of the Unit
ed Railroads said the piles under the
bridge had rotted, endangering the
safety of the public. Lane will pre
pare plans to put the bridge In nrst
class condition and an appropriation
will be made in the next budget. The
committee asked Lane to urge the
United Railroads to bear a share of
the entire expense, which may aggre
gate $5000.
YOUNG MENDAZONA DROWNS
HIMSELF WHILE IXSAXE
R. M. Aguirre, French and Spanish
interpreter at the Hall of Justice, re
ported to the Coroner yesterday that
the young man who was seen to throw
himself overboard from Lombard
street wharf last Sunday morn
ing was Antonio Mendazona, a
Spaniard engaged in the sheep busi
ness in Butte County. Mr. Aguirre
said that Mendazona, who roomed in
the same house with him at 1312
Powell street, seemed to have become
suddenly insane last Saturday night
and went out of the house bent upon
doing himself some mischief. Mr.
Aguirre followed him out Market
street to Tenth and back to Kearny
endeavoring to have him come home,
but the young man refused to do so,
saying that he was going to the ferry
to jump overboard. Aguirre left him
on Kearny street at 1 o'clock on Sun
day morning, being worn out with hie
long tramp. He has identified the hat
left on the wharf by the suicide as
that of Mendazona.

CRAIG'S JEW
IS MERITORIOUS
His Shylock at the Alcazar
Surprises Critics by Its
Strength and Lack of Kant
HAS CAPITAL SUPPORT
Central's Audience Thrills
at the Scenes and Dialogue
of "A Hide for Lite"
Admirers of John Craig went to the
Alcazar last night in fear and trem
bling as to what the outcome would
be of his essay as Shylock in "The
Merchant of Venice." It did not seem
possible that the actor who had given
such rare light comedy character as
he did in The Professor's Love
Story" could vault over the high stone
wall that divides comedy from trag
edy and succeed in a role which the
best tragedians have found difficult.
But those admirers and well wishers
troubled themselves in vain, for the
Shylock of Mr. Craig was a character
ization that made a hit from the start.
There was earnestness and directness
In the personation; strength without
rant, dignity without straining and
power without overdoing in the Shy
lock of Mr. Craig. In the passages
wherein he complained of the indig
nities to which he had been subject
ed upon the Rialto there was real pa
thos, such as enlisted the sympathy
of the audience for one of the most
unlovable characters that the great
Shakespeare ever drew, and in the
courtroom scene, where the Jew re
veals himself in his most detestable
aspect, the art of the actor called forth
disgust and derision.
The support was excellent. Lillian
Lawrence gave the critics a Portia in
which there was nothing to condemn
and much to praise. The Jessica of
Mary Young was most artistic in con
ception, as well as in execution. John
B. Maher'B Launcelot was one of the
best things he has done in many a
day. The play is beautifully staged
and costumed and will have a success
ful run.
Savage's Opera Company.
Opera lovers are preparing to ex
tend a hearty welcome to the English
pinging songbirds when the Savage
Grand Opera Company makes its first
bow at the Columbia Theater next
Monday night. This will be the first
visit of an ail-American company able
to give real grand opera. The Savage
company is the largest of Its kind. It
numbers over 150 people, with an
orchestra of fifty pieces under two
conductors, and carries a complete
equipment of scenery and costumes on
a special train of fourteen cars.
Among the principals are over a score
of prima donnas, tenors, barytones and
basses who are known by reputation,
hut who will be new to California.
The best known artists are Joseph
Sheehan, the high C tenor; William
"Wegener, the Wagerian tenor, and
Reginald Roberts, the lyric tenor;
Gertrude Rennyson and Jean Lane
Brooks, two superb dramatic sopranos;
Marion Ivell and Rita Newman, con
traltos; Winfred Goff, Arthur Deane,
Francis J. Boyle, Harrison W. Ben
nett and Kate Sherwood. The con
ductors include the Chevalier N. B.
Emanuel, who has had thirty years'
experience in Europe, and Elliott
Schenck, the Wagnerian conductor,
who is the only American musician be
sides Walter Damrosch, that has de
ve'oped into a grand opera musical di
rector.
Central.
The usual Monday night jam pre
vailed at the Central Theater last
evening to witness the initial produc
tion of "A Ride for Life.' The pro.
duction is a melodrama that is re
plete with startling and picturesque
features. It is remarkably well staged
and the four acts glided along much
too fast for the audience last night.
Herschel Mayall. as Jack Woodruff,
came in for his usual share of ap
plause. The clever actor interpreted
the role in charming style, and the
applause was deserved. Juliet Cros
by[ as Annie Powers, was as charm
ing as ever and appealed to the femi
nine portion of the audience. Myrtle
Vane, Julia Blanc, Walter Shannon.
James Corrigan and George P. Web
s-tor all scored hits in their respective
roles and the other members of the
company lent their support to the
stars satisfactorily.
Bispham's First Concert.
The first of the series of three con
certs to be given in San Francisco by
the noted barytone, David Bispham,
v.-ill take place at Lyric Hall this
evening. From all indications it will
be one of the most interesting events
of the musical season. Mr. Bispham
has enjoyed a rest of several days after
his transcontinental journey and is in
fine condition to give the enormously
difficult performances he modestly
calls "concerts." In the matter of
programme making Mr. Bispham is
m&ster. The range of his selections
is astonishing.

COSSACK RIDERS
ON DARING RAID
General Rennenkampff's Di
vision Penetrates Well to
the Rear of Oyama's Army
ITS LOSS IS TRIFLING
One Man Killed and Twelve
Wounded During Six-Day
Tour of Enemy's Country
MUKDEN, Feb. 20.â General Ren
nenkampff's division, which moved out
on February 14, has returned from a
daring reconnaissance, having suc
ceeded in passing around the Japanese
left flank and penetrating well to the
rear, causing considerable consterna
tion along the line of Japanese com
munications. The losses were insignifi
cant. It was merely a raid, with no
Intention to strike in the direction of
Yinkow.
On the first day the division, which
moved in two columns, drove in the ;
Japanese cavalry and traveled twenty
five miles, stopping for the night in the
village of Santaitse, nine miles south
west of Jsiacobeje, on the line with
Liaoyang and the southward Japanese i
positions. Throughout the night Rus- '
eian videttes were in touch with the
Japanese and in the morning they I
brought in information that a force
c f infantry was moving northwestward
with a view of cutting: off the Rus- â¢
Bians. while a body of 5000 Chinese <
bandits, said to be commanded by a
Chinese Governor, appeared to the
southward to prevent a movement on :
Yinkow, had surh been the intention, i
At this juncture the commander de- I
termined. instead of retiring and i
abandoning his purpose of a reconnais
sance, to strike eastward, discover the !
strength of the enemy and threaten his '
rear. This bold movement was sue- j
cessful. At noon columns of Japanese '
cavalry were encountered, but meeting !
the fire of the trans-Baikal battery,
the Japanese fled, with Cossacks in j
pursuit. A battalion of Japanese in
fantry opened fire from a village. The
Russian left, which had changed front,
advanced and forced the Japanese to
abandon the village. Owing to dark- :
ness and lack of knowledge of the
strength of the Japanese, further pur
suit was suspended. The division
passed the night at the village of
Painkfan.
At daybreak of February 16 the di
vision moved eastward toward the vil
lage of Oudlagantse, which was en
trenched and occupied by Japanese
horse artillery. The advance guards
opened fire, concentrating on the
trenches in front of the village. The
distance was not great and the effect
of bursting shrapnel was easily visible.
The Japanese cavalry- suffered severe
ly, shrapnel bursting in their midst,
stampeding their horses. Detachments
of Russians occupied villages on the
flank and drove back the Japanese.
The division, having accomplished its
task, retraced its road, meeting no ser
ious resistance. The Russian losses
â were one Cossack killed and an en-
Fign and eleven men wounded.

ASSASSIN A MAX OF WEALTH.
Rough Outer Garments Evidently
Adopted as a Disguise.
MOSCOW, Feb. 20. â Although the
identity of the assassin of Grand Duke
Sergius has not yet been ascertained,
the police are convinced that he is not
a workman, but is a man of good birth.
His underclothing is of good quality
and is. fashionably made and his outer
workman's garb evidently was as
sumed as a disguise. He strongly ob
jected to donning prison attire and for
a long time refused to take off his
warm undershirt for fear of catching
cold.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1905.
STUDENTS OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY OF ST. PETERSBURG
JOIN STRIKE MOVEMENT AID THE INSTITUTION WILL CLOSE
Young Russia Adds Its Protest Against Despotism and Bureauc
racy and Joins in Demand for a Measure of Liberty.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 21. â With
the resolution of the student body of
the yreat University of St. Petersburg
yesterday to suspend studies for the
remainder of the university year, al
most the whole educational system of
Russia has entered upon a period of
stagnation â the protest of the youth
of Russia against the bureaucratic
system and other governmental griev- j
ances. Other universities of Russia, i
gymnasia and even grammar schools
j were already on strike, and the mil- '
| itary in various portions of the em-
I pire has been obliged to resort to
force to restrain schoolboys of tender
years who are joining the general
movement. [ _^
The meeting of St. Petersburg stu
dents, at -which more than 3000 par
ticipated, besides voting with practical
unanimity to suspend studies until
September 1, adopted a set of politi
cal resolutions demanding the forma
tion of a constituent assembly and
characterized the proposed summon
ing of the zemsky zabor as Inadequate
for the emergency. The resolutions,
after speaking of "the; progressive de
moralization of Russia under the in
fluence of the absolute regime," de
clare for freedom of speech,
lof the press and of conscience,
the right of association and
assembly and to strike, which are
described as necessary conditions for
the further progress of Russia. The
meeting also unanimously decided to
express disapproval of the Govern
ment's action In dealing with the
workmen who attempted to present
their petition to the Emperor on Jan
! vary 22 and its sympathy with the
victims of the soldiers. A large fac
tion voted in favor of ending the war.
A strong revolutionary feeling was
manifested, the red flag was waved
and the Russian "Marseillaise" and
other revolutionary songs were chant-
I cd. A large portrait of the Emperor
in the great auditorium of the univer
sity, where the meeting was held, was
torn into strips. The police did not
interfere.
Following is the text of the preamble
and resolutions adopted by the stu
dents:
Effete RusÃlan absolutism is drawing daily â
nay, hourly â to its Inevitable doom. Powerless
to cope with an awakened people, in Its agony
It devises one measure more ridiculous than
another and one more method more reckless
than another to delay its downfall. It entered
upon a criminal policy In the Far Bast whiÂ«h
has cost the people tens of thousands of lives
and millions of hard-earned money. Con
eclous of its goal, the intelligence of the stu
dents has long conducted a stubborn fight to
obtain the most elementary human rights,
often falling; fainting before the brutal force
of an unbridled Government, until at last the
proletariat entered the historic arena and. at
the 6ame time, as it cam* to the knowledge of
itself, dealt Czardom the heaviest blow. The
recent bloody incidents have clearly shown
that absolutism is capable of no defense of
Its pitiful, shameful existence. The sincere,
fraternal, harmonious action of the proletariat
on these days of January signed the death
warrant of absolutism and without doubt in
sured the epeedy political liberation of Russia.
We, as n. faction of the educational commu
nity, conscious of our gx>al, welcome the
solidarity of the workmen and put forward the
following demands :
1 The summoning of a legislative assembly
on the basis of a universal, equal and secret
ballot cf male and female citizenship, freedom
of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of
organization and strike.
2 Amnesty for all who have been punished
for their political or religious convictions.
3. The fact of t>elonEing to any particular
nationality shall not prejudice political rights.
Further, as a guarantee against interference
of the Russian Government in the free execu
tion of these demands, a people's militia must
immediately be formed in whose ranks all cltl
aens can fight to realize our aspirations.
There is no conflrrrtation of the re
port that Emperor Nicholas has decid
ed to issue a decree on March 4 con
vening the zemsky zabor.
The joint commission of employers
and workmen instituted by the Em
peror to investigate the causes of labor
disturbances, is now taking shape. The
workmen of a number of large facto
ries have already elected representa
tives to the assemblage which will
choose the labor members of the com
mission. The Putitoff Company's men
have taken a bold step in selecting
among their men representatives who
were put into Jail after the affair of
January 22, including Inozemtzeff. the
vice president of Father Gopon's or
ganization.
"These are our leaders," say the
workmen; "now see if the Government
is sincere in saying it will allow us
free choice and immunity from arrest."
The peasants of two communes in
the Province of Voronesch, In South
west Russia, have taken the unprece
dented step of telegraphing direct to
Emperor Nicholas, asking that their
wishes be consulted in the settlement
of the grievances in the matter of
rents.

REES ESCAPES
FROM BELMONT
Howell Caradoc Rees, the New York
clubman, whose recent eccentric ac
tions at the Palace and St. Francis
hotels culminating in his threats to
kill a friend named Gignoux, his arrest j
and final sequestration in a private
sanitarium at Belmont, made a recent
sensation, escaped from that institu- p
tion last night and walked back to the
city.
Late last evening, hungry and foot
sore, and bearing noticeable evidence
of having made a long and rough over
land trip, Rees suddenly appeared in
the St. Francis Hotel bar. There he
procured a drink and then returned to
the hotel office, where he told the
clerks that he had only a few hours
before escaped from the Belmont Sani
tarium.
His eyes were bloodshot, his formerly
full face rather drawn and his clothes
soiled with dust. To the hotel clerk he
said he had walked from Belmont, but
later he referred to an experience on
an electric car, which .suggested the
probability of his having ridden part
of the way.
"I won't take a room to-night," re
marked Rees, "for it is too late," and
turning around he marched out of the
hotel, whistling loudly. To several
guests of the hotel, who had met him,
while he was staying at the St. Fran
cis, Rees appeared to be as insane, if
not more so, than when he was ar
rested several weeks ago.
Rees comes from a good New York
family and is a well educated man,
who has seen much of the world.
During his several weeks' stay in
San Francisco he stayed first at the
Palace and then at the St. Francis.
At the latter hostelry he ran up a
large bill and was finally locked out.
His arrest for threatening Gignoux's
life followed and on January 25 he
vas turned over to his friends and
placed in the Belmont Sanitarium. A
week later -his brother came from
New York to arrange for his comfort
and eventual removal to a private
asylum in New York, whither Rees
was to be taken in a few days.

ROBBERS BEAT

Two men last night held up the sa

the corner of Twenty-fourth and Noe
streets. The thieves beat the
proprietor and a customer Into
unconsciousness when resistance to
the robbery was offered. One of
the robbers, who gave the name of
Edward Welsh and said he was a
painter living at 921 Alvarado street,
was arrested later and booked at the
Mission station on a charge of rob
bery.
About 8:45 p. m. George Davorlen
of 441 Elizabeth street went to the
rear of Hood's saloon. He saw Welsh
and his confederate attempting to roli
away a barrel of whisky. When he
asked what they were doing the
thieves set upon him and dealt him a
succession of blows on the head and
face, cutting his scalp in three places.
Proprietor Hood heard the scuffle and
rushed to the rear of his establish
ment to ascertain the trouble. Welsh
seized a large cigar cutter and felled
Hood with one blow. While the pro
prietor and customer lay unconscious
the robbers went through the till, took
$7, all it contained, and made their
escape.
When Hood recovered conscious
ness he telephoned for the pollke. De
tective Graham and Policemen Cole
man and Harrison arrested Welsh at
Twenty-fifth and Harrison streets.
Hood identified him as one of his as
sailants.
Davorlen was removed to the City
and County Hospital, where it was
found that he had several ugly lac
erations of the scalp and a possible
fractured skull. Hood was prostrat
ed by the blows he received and will
be confined to his bed for several
days.
Welsh's confederate, who escaped,
is described as being about 24 years
of age. He wears a slouch hat and
light overcoat. Hood and Davorlen
say they can identify him if he is cap
tured. The police are still looking
for him.
At a late hour last night Harry
Craig of Twenty-sixth and Castro
streets was arrested by Policeman Col
burn and Detective Graham on the
belief that he was Welsh's confederate.
He has a bad police record. The po
lice had to break into his room to
capture him. He was identified by
George Davorlen as one of the men
who assaulted him and Hood. Craig
was booked at the Mission station on
a charge of robbery.

MUSICAL STARS
AVOID BERLIN
Paderewski, Melba, Kubelik
and Caruso Complain of
Unfairness in Germany
IRVING'S FORMER PAY
Famous Actor Forty Years
Ago in London Received
Fourteen Dollars a Week
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 20.â Hufi) Gorlitz.
Paderewski's manager, is authority
for the rather surprising statement
that owing to unfair treatment re
ceived by them in Berlin, six of the
greatest musical artists of the twen
tieth century, including Paderewski. de
cline to accept engagements in the Ger
man capital at any terms. Goriitz says
that when Paderewski played at the
Philharmonic Hall in Berlin, opponents
of the ereat pianist bribed members
of the orchestra. He declares that the
horn deliberately played out of tune,
and when an encore was given the con
ductor spent most of the time in sneez
ing. So Paderewski has refused to
visit the Kaiser's capital again, de
clining a recent offer of $7500 for two
concerts.
Gorlitz says that since Paderewski
was insulted the two De Reszkea also
have declined offers from Berlin and
that, Melba, Caruso and Kubelik all
have received such unfair treatment
from musical critics in Berlin that
nothing will induce them to visit the
city.
Apropos of Paderewski. an account
has just come to hand of a graceful
little act which the pianist performed
in Auckland, New Zealand, during his
recent tour. A concert which Pad
wrewski had advertised at Auckland,
having been abruptly abandoned,
thirty music lovers who had traveled
long distances to attend the recital
went to Paderewski's hotel for re
dress. As soon as the pianist under
stood their errand he had the whole
party up into his private apartments,
where he played several selections for
them and insisted on all hands having
supper with him afterward.
SHAW SCORES SHAKESPEARE.
George Bernard Shaw, having been
rediscovered in the United States re
cently, the go-ahead managers of the
Court Theater, who also are going to
produce plays by Ibsen. Briex, Mae
terlinck and W. B. Yeats during the
spring season, have decided to devote
much attention to the author of
"Candida." "John Bull's Other Is
land" is to have a two weeks' run
beginning next Monday. The skit,
'Hnw He Lied to Her Hsuband,"
which Shaw wrote for Arnold Daly and
whirh has not yet been seen in this
<ountry. will form part of a triple bill
at the Court before long, and a bit later
"You Never Can Tell' Is to be re
vival.
Ituidentally Shaw has been having
another go at the rival for whom he
has so eminent a contempt â the late
William Shakespeare. In a lecture de
li vrrod at Manchester the other day,
Shaw declared that Shakespeare was a
snob.
"He was born a snob, lived a snob j
and died a snob." asserted Shaw. ]
"His one dream was to get enough !
money to go back to Stratford to buy I
back the property of his bankrupt
family and get back their coat of
arms. Do not suppose that Shakes- i
pea re was a democratic character. He ;
had no religious belief, and his phil- I
nsophy was that evil is greater than j
good." Shaw also complained of the
want of sympathy for the democracy |
in Shakespeare's plays. "They are
crowded," he said, "with kings and
nobles, and the members of the lower
classes are always servants."
CALIFORNIA ON STAGE.
The play in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," in which Bottom, the weaver;
Snug, the joiner, and their comrades
take part, is called to mind by a the
atrical performance which has just
been given in the little English village
of Hildenborough, Kent. The piece
given was a melodrama of California
called "The Luck of the Brians,"
which had been written in the village
and was performed by villagers.
The cast included a local tailor, two
blacksmiths, a bicycle repairer, a gar

FOUR PUBLIC CHOICES FALL BY THE WAYSIDE AT OAKLAND TRACK
RECTOR, A HEAVILY SUPPORTED CHOICE IN THE RING,
IS EASILY DEFEATED BY JUDGE, WITH IVA POWELL UP
Mooropus Captures the Two- Year-Old Scramble in a Gallop,
Well Ridden by Bonner and Backed From 12 to 3.
Greenock Takes a
Fancy to the
Deep Going.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Four public choices were tipped over
m the muddy going at Oakland yester
day. The bookmakers had little to
gloat over though, for the different
winners were all fairly well backed.
No doubt thÂ« severest rebuff re
ceived by the talent occurred in the
concluding event, when Rector fell
easy prey to Judge. Mrs. Bckert's>
sprinter, which closed a 9 to 10 favor
ite, did not handle weight as well as
expected and Judge, nicely ridden by
Powell, won In ragtime fashion. The
winner's odds were forced down from
18 to 5 to 12 to 6.
The maiden two-rear-old scramble at
three furlongs wag responsible tor a
very warm one in Mooropus, a son of
Canopus. The youngster's price was
I'ounded down from 12 to 3 and, ridden
nner, yon in a gallop. Iron Wat
>-on beat the favorite, St. Francis,
engths for the place.
Greenock captured the six furlong
belling number, starting second choice
in the betting. The old fellow has
a decided fancy tor light muddy going
and he scored like a stake horse. Hlp
ponax, the favorite, finished second,
more than a length ahead of Port
Wayne. Bath Beach out out thÂ© early
pace and then died away.
With both Alone and Mistress of
Rolls scratched from the seven furlong
selling number for three-year-olds, a
very open betting proposition was left,
Jimmy Coffey*s filly Light of.Day, with
Taylor up, had the call and finished
second to Grenore. Wright rode the
latter, keeping his mount in front from
start uÂ» finish. Calculate failed to dis
play any epeed.
Profitable appears to be a very good
horse at times to play. In the betting
â  n the mile and fifty-yard selling run
he was the only one in demand, and
went out winning all the way. Glen
;.rvon finished second and Play Ball
third. The golnp was too heavy for
Follow Me. Graham was not strong
enough to do anything with Mr.
Dingle.
Not unlike many another young
rider, Graham found It impossible to
ride two races alike. The youngster
had the mount again on Barney Drey
fuss, favorite for the mile and a six
b selling event, and had rather a
tempestuous voyage. Finally losing an
acre of ground on the stretch turn, his
mount finished an indifferent second
-nt. the second choice. Budd
Wade took the show from Serenity.

McLoughlin Carries Home
the Trophy by Beating
Strachan in the Finals
The final match of the boys' handi
cap singles tournament, which was not
completed on the park courts Satur
day afternoon, was finished yesterday.
The contestants were Miles Mclaugh
lin and Robert Strachan. McLiOUghlin
was the victor and his name will be
the first engraved on the handsome
Reed and Barton trophy. This cup Is
the best that has been competed for
on the park oourts. About fifty boys
entered the tournament and each was
anxious to secure the first win. The
cup must be won three times under
handicap conditions.
McLrOughlln's victory was a well
earned one as he was the most heavily
handicapped player in the tourna
ment. He played from "80" below
acratch and in his first match also
gave "30." In the finals yesterday he
allowed Strachan owe odds of "16."
When darkness set in on Saturday the
score read set all and 4-4.
The players decided to play the
third and deciding set over. Mc-
Loug-hlln won the set played yesterday
quite handily. The soore was 6-2.
The winner was extremely steady for
a* youngster and made but few errors.
Strachan played a clever game for so
small a lad, but McLoughlin was too
strong for him.
Schaeffer Breaks Finger.
PTTTSBURG, Pa_, Feb. 20. â Jaoob
Schaeffer, the bllliardist, met with a
mishap last night that will keep him

Ing. He broke the little finger of his
right hand. The physician who at

NELSON QUITS
THE GYMNASIUM
Battler and His Retinue
Try Their Hands at Row
ing and Framing Jokes
COBBETT A BUSY BOXER
Little Denverite Keeps Up
the Same Old Grind and
Tips Beam at 135 Pounds
The programme was changed at
Battling Nelson's training quarters
yesterday, the gymnasium work being
dispensed with. Manager Billy Nolan
thought a change would do Bat good
jso he ordered the gymnasium locked
| and invited his protege and his traln
[ing mates for a boat ride in Escalle
Creek. But tWe boys soon became tired
of tugging at the oars and Smiling
Metzner suggested that the party take
a swim.
The weather wasn't any too tem
perate, but the boys procured bathing
suits and then the fun commenced.
"Rawhide" Kelly put one foot in the
briny deep and said "Not for me," and
proceeded to dress. The wink was
passed and in less time than it takes
to relate "Rawhide" was struggling
and sputtering in the water.
Smiling Metzner was sitting on an
ark screaming with laughter and mak
ing all manner of fun of "Rawhide,"
when Bat quietly crept behind him and
threw him overboard fully dressed,
Hugo wanted to finish Bat then and
there, but Billy Nolan interfered and
pacified the Smiling one.
The water was too cold to stay in
any length of time, so the party re
turned to camp.
In the morning Bat took his usual
run of ten miles and after a rubdown
walked half way up Mount Tamaipaie.
He seems to be in the best possible
condition and wishes the tight would
fake place sooner.
Young Corbett's training quarters at
Billy Shannon's villa looked deserted
yesterday after the rush of Sunday. A
few faithful fans were on hand to
greet the little Denverite and all were
greatly pleased at the form displayed
by him. Corbett seems tireless and he
is always ready to don his training at
tire. In the afternoon Corbett and
Gans were taking a sun bath in front
of the villa, when Frankle McDonald
yelled "Three o'clock, time to go to
work."
Corbett "was on his feet in a second,
but the sun looked good to Joe and he
pleaded for time. Bill couldn't see It
that way, however, and hustled Joe
into the gymnasium. Boxing was dis
pensed with, but the pair wrestled for
fully twenty minutes without taking
a breathing spell.
Corbett then jumped the rope 1000
times, punched the bag four rounds
and pulled the weights. He is as nim
ble as a Â£at on his feet and his wind
is perfect. The weight is the least of
his troubles, as he tipped the beam
to-day at 135 pounds.
Corbett says: "I never felt better in
my life and I feel as strong as an ox."
He certainly looks the part, not a flaw
in his make-up being visible.
Another Stake at Ingleside.
"When the drawing for the "Wash
ington's birthday stake was held at
Ingleside on Sunday the management
was short of hares. A shipment of
the jacks arrived yesterday and an ad
ditional sixteen-dog stake was drawn
last night. The draw resulted as fol
lows: Gllmore vs. Commercial Trav
eler; Odd Eyes vs. Vandal; Maid of
Mercy vs. Slim Jim; Pasha Pleasant
vs. Fenii; Helen Hayes vs. Courtley
Guest; Glancing Pasha vs. Shotgun;
Wedgewood vs. Belle Lloyd; Belfast
vs. Bob R.
BENEFIT GAME
A STAR EVENT
Leading Diamond Lights to
Be Seen in Action When
Time Is Called To-Morrow
The benefit ball game that will be
pulled off to-morrow afternoon at
Recreation Park in aid of Honest Jim
McDonald promises to be one of the
sporting events of the season. Already
thousands of tickets have been dis
posed of and every man and woman
who knows the noted wielder of the in
dicator will probably "be among those
present.
The game will be a battle of the
stars. Brother Joe Corbett will pitch
for one team and Parke Wilson is
billed to hold his curves. Hal Chase
plays first base, Mohler second, Irwin
third, Shay short and in the outfield
there will be Meany, Walters and San
dow. Merles, the pride of the New York
Giants. It looks like as fast an aggre
gation as ever played ball around this
village.
Big Ovie Overall, whom the people of
Cincinnati are all waiting 1 to see, will
pitch against â¢ Brother Joe. Charley
Graham is to be Ovie's receiver. The
infield will be made up of Marty Mur
phy, Gochnauer, Devereaux and Truck
Eagan. In the outfield Charley Doyle,
Hogan and MoJLaughlin will scamper
around.
Mike Fisher and Charley Gaggus
have consented to do the honors with
the Indicators. A special feature of
the programme are the bouts between
the pugilistic stars. Britt and Berger
will hook up, as will also Gans and
Frankle Neil. The goes will be ref
ereed by Eddie Graney.
At the present time Jim McDonald is
a very sick man. He may never again
stand in the middle of the diamond and
shout "Play ball." Jim has always
been held in high regard by Bportingr
men of every description and on that
account the benefit should prove a rec
ord breaker.
Will Discuss New Field.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 20.
A student assembly is to be held at
Stanford to-morrow morning for thÂ«
purpose of discussing: plans for the
building of the new athletic field.
Part of these grounds, the football
field, must be finished in time for the
intercollegiate game with California
next fall. When completed the field
will furnish ample provision for every
branch of athletics. Dr. Frank Angel
of the faculty and F. L. Berry. '00, of
San Francisco will be the prinlcpal
i speakers at the gathering.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
In July, 1883, I began to break outwitlx
Eczema on my head, legs and anas, an4j
began treatment with local doctors, but
did not get much relief. They said the di 9*
ease had become chronic. I then quit the
and tried various ointments arid soaps fn+
another two years, but as soon as col 4
weather came I was as bad off as ever, so I
finally decided to let medicine alone, and
for twelve or thirteen years did nothing
towards curing the Eczema, except bath*
ing. This seemed to do about as ranch
good as anything I had tried.
During the time I lost about one-half of
my hair. I began 8. S. S. doubtful of 4
cure, because the disease had run so long,
but soon discovered your medicine was)
doing me good, and continued to taketit.
I ' used seven bottles, when I was com*
pletely cured, not having a single spot on,
my body, which before was almost com*
pletely covered. F. c. NoaFOXK.

The head, feet and hands are ussally
the parts affected, though the disease ap.
pears on other parts of the body. While ex-
ternal applications allay the itching and
burning temporarily, it is the adds thrown
off by the blood that cause the irritation
and eruptions upon the skin. The acids
must be neutralized and the system clean*.

FOR ORDERS FROM LONDON OWNERS
Departure of the Steamship for Vladivostok Is Delayed

Five of Blockade

The British steamer Brinkburn
Captain Peters, which left "here re
cently with a large cargo of supplies
lor Vladivostok, returned yesterday
and will await instructions from Lon
don before either discharging her car
ro or proceeding for the Russian port.
The Brinkburn vent from here to
Comox,' where she filled her coal
bunkers for the run across the Pacific.
From Comox she was ordered to Vic
toria. While there the cable told her
owners in London that the Japanese
blockade was in first-class working
- axid that the Mikado's navy was
gathering in everything in the way of
Hoating property that was headed for
Vladivostok. It was decided to aban
don the attempt to take the Brink
bum through, the blockade and Cap
tain Peters was ordered to bring his
ship to this port and discharge his
cargo. When the Brinkburn arrived
off port, however, two sets of orders
were placed on board. One ordered
Captain Peters to proceed with all
speed to Vladivostok. The other or
dered him to wait outside for further
orders. As five members of the .crew
had deserted at Victoria and as the
orders were conflicting, Captain Pet
ers decided to come into port, and he
is here.
He communicated by cable with
London and expects to-day to receive
definite instructions. Meanwhile he
will ship five men to replace the de
serters and be prepared to carry out,
without delay, any orders he may re
ceive.
â¢ c December 19 th* Japanese
have captured thirteen steamers off
Vladivostok. Four of them were load
:h Cardiff coal, 22,400 tons of it
altogether; one carried kerosene, an
machine oil and shipbuilding
Ifl and the others forage, pro
m and greneral supplies. Two of
â  hailed from this port, the
field find I Dollar. Of the
t-n blockade runners two were
in December, eipht In Jan
and three this month, two of
them yesterday. All hut two of the

11 Was Not the Aztffc,
The weather bureau lookout at Point Reyes
yesterday morning reported to the Merchants'
!:>.1 1.&r.g- and the Marine Exchange that the
Pacific Mail Company's freighter Aztec, Cap
tain Frailer, had passed that promontory,
bound south. As the Aztec is bound from
ilororan, direct to Acapulco. the Merchants'
Kxchange afiked to have the report repeated
and the nam^ of the steamer carefully spelled.
In tht amended report the n*Â»sln4f vessel
proved to be the Arctic from Eureka, which
later rcacaed port. The other exchange re
ixjrted the Aztec to tbe Pacific Mall Company
and Captain .7\cr was promptly pilloried
as all kinds of an un-navigator for getting
three thousand miles oS his course. It was
i-peallt-d that when the Aztec left her* with
orders to proceed direct to Yokohama, Captain
Trazier wandered into Honolulu and there was
much speculation as to why h* should lay his
course from Mororan for Acapulco by way of
Point Reyes. When the little tempest was
boiling rurlously the mistake was discovered
and all the hammers were put away. Captain
Frazier was formerly in the army transport
service, but was relieved of his command
and his Gcx'crnment Job when he ran the
Sherman on the rocks.
Southerly Wind Delays Coasters.
TVhpn the * wind blows from the southward
with a velocity of sixty miles an hour, as it
did on Sunday, it means that southbound coast
ers are going to burn an extra amount of
coal without any adequate compensation in the
way of increased speed. In fact with a slxty
tnile-an-hour breeze to buck, it's a powerful
coast *r that makes enough headway to keep
the log line stretched out astern. Standing
still sometimes means a high consumption of
fuel Tha steamer Breakwater, which under
onJinary circuniEuaicea easily makes the run
from Coos Ray to this port in thirty-three
hours, arrived yesterday Just seventeen hours
late. The City of Puebla, due yesterday morn
ing from Puget Sound, had not put in an
appearance late in the afternoon and all south
bound coasters that were out. in Sunday's
blow will be very late reaching port. . The
wind blew with less velocity yesterday, but
the bar continued rough and no vessels put to
t-Â«a unless the maintenance of a schedule de
manded It.
Santiago Ties the Archer.
Captain Lanc&Etcr or the barkentine Archer
spoke too soon on Sunday when he claimed
the victory in the three-cornered race between
his vessel, the bark Santiago and the barken
tine IrmpanL The Archer came up In twÂ°n
ty-flvfc day*. She arrived Sunday. "I have
won, hands down." said Captain Lancaster
when he found the other vessels not In port.
The Santiago, however, left Honolulu more
than a day later than the Archer and yester
day Â«he came Into port, alÂ»o twenty-five days
from Honolulu, and Captain Anderson, if the
corrected time do** not show thÂ« Santiago a
winner, expects at least to divide the purse
with Captain Lancaster. Trie Irmgard Is now
out â¢ -.<â¢*â  r.ty-ii*v*n days.
Tbe Overdue list.
The British ship Hal^wood was added yes
terday to the overdue list. Bhe is out 127
days from Vancouver for Callao and In a cable
received from London by 11. A. Newell her
rate was quoted I.' 10 per oent. The rate on

FORMER SURVEYOR DEFEATS
CITY IN A SUIT FOR PAY
C S. Tilton Must Be Compensated for
Services Rendered as Engineer
Thirteen Years Ago.
By the decision of Judge Troutt,
rendered yesterday in a written opin
ion, C. 6. Tilton is to receive $8500
and Interest for services performed for
the city and county more than a
dozen years ago. Tilton was City and
County Surveyor in 1891 and 1892.
By resolution of the Supervisors, in
January. 1901, he was directed to
make an investigation and report upon
a sewer outlet for Richmond District. :
After the report was made he was in- \
structed to prepare plans and speci
fications for the construction of the
system, and when the plans were ac
cepted he was then directed to pre
pare the usual diagrams of the prop- '
erty affected by the proposed sewer. .
These duties were those of a "city
engineer" and no such office then ex
isting the board was empowered to
employ the services necessary.
Upon the result of Tilton's labors a
contract for building the system was
awarded to the California Bridge
Company and afterward declined for |
the reason (held invalid by Troutt)
that the State law did not provide for
the construction of sewers through
private property.
After the expiration of Tilton's term
of office the contract was rescinded
and new specifications were ordered
made by the new City Engineer, Fitz
hugh. In a suit brought by Pitahugh,
in which the point was involved, the
Supreme Court held that Tilton might
be entitled to compensation for his
services whether he had a legal
remedy or not.
On the strength of this decision
Judge Troutt holds that Tilton is en
titled to recover and that the objection
that he could not claim compensation
for services performed while he was
Surveyor is not tenable. It is also
held that the constitutional amend
ment empowering the payment of cer
tain unpaid claims for certain fiscal
years applies to this claim.

ABANDONS USE
OF OLD TERMS
Weather Bureau No Longer
to Divide State in Reports
Into "North" and "South"
NAMES ARE MISLEADING
California Climatic Belts to
Be Known as "3lountain,"
"Valley" and "Coastal"
The United States Weather Bureau
at Washington announces that It is
planning to discard from Its reports
the terms "north" and "south" in de
scriptions of the climatology of Cali
fornia. Instead of these misleading
geographical terms the bureau will use
"Mountain," "Valley" and "Coastal"
as more conveniently describing the
climatic belts of the State.
The decision of the Weather Bureau
is a result of correspondence with the
California Promotion Committee,
which suggested that inasmuch as
the climate conditions in California
were different from those of other
States, the usual nomenclature of the
bureau describing the climate in the
different States would not apply in
California. Geographical terms may
be misleading in describing California
climates. Climate in California Is not
determined by the distance north and
south as it is on the Atlantic seaboard,
but by the distance east and west, by
altitude and distance from the ocean.
What is known by the Weather Bu
reau as the "Orange-Growing Thermal
Belt," extends from San Diego County
on the south almost to the base of
Mt. Shasta on the north, a distance of
700 miles. The mean annual tempera
ture in this belt is between 60 and 70
degrees Fahrenheit. The first oranges
on the Eastern markets from Cali
fornia grow in the Sacramento Valley.
The decision of the Weather Bureau
to divide the State into valley, moun
tain and coastal districts will be of
advantage to the whole State and will
give the Eastern inquirer a correct
idea of the conditions he will find in
different parts of California.
The Promotion Committee has re
ceived the following letter from Pro
fessor Moore, dated Washington, Feb
ruary 8:
Referring to your favor of the 3d inst.. and
to previous correspondence regarding terms
used In California weather forecasts. I beg to
say that the climatic peculiarities to which you
refer, and the difficulty in covering them in a
general forecast, for even a part of the State,
la appreciated by the Weather Bureau, and a
plan will be devised to carry out your sug
gestion to divide the State into valley, moun
tain and coastal, rather than Into north and
south districts.
Thanking you for calling my attention to a
means by which the Weather Bureau can
improve its service In California, I am, very
truly yours, WILLIB L. MOORE,
Chief United States Weather Bureau.
An active campaign has been under
way for a year or more to secure a
more extended notice of California cli
mate in the East. The San Francisco
weather report receives a wider circu
lation than that of any other city in
the United States except Bismarck, N.
D., and Omaha, Nebr., which are, it is
said, peculiarly situated as forecast
stations for the entire country. The
San Francisco we.atb.er report Is sent
to the local weather observers in
eighty-seven cities with the direction
for publication in their weather re
ports to their local papers.
The committee has still on hand a
few copies of "Climatology of Califor
nia," by Alexander C. McAdie, of
which 2000 extra copies were struck
off by the Department of Agriculture
from the original plates for distribu
tion by the committee. Two maps are
available for free distribution, , Â»ne
showing the "Orange-growing Thermal
Belt" and the other showing the pre
cipitation for twenty years.

HEALTH BOARD
IS CRITICIZED
Finance Committee Declares
There Was No Need of an
Appeal for Food Donations
TO DISMISS MECHANICS
Department of Publk Works
Asks $5000 for 3lainte
nance of Building Bureau
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
received a report from the Fi
nance Committee in which the Health
Board is criticized for its recent ap
peal to the public for donations of
milk, vegetables and- fruit to the em
ployes of the County Hospital who
are dissatisfied with their fare. The
report contains a statement showing
that the allowance for the hospital in
1900-1 was $87,600; in 1901-2, $101,560,
in 1902-3, $110,000; in 1903-4, $l
and in 1904-5. $144,100. The committee
declares that the Health Board is not
handicapped by a smaller fund than
its predecessors. The report con
tinues:
The budget of 1904-9 allows tho City and
County Hospital $12,200 for maintenance and
$9100 for repairs in excess of the budget al
lowances of rjQ.'{-4, and $23,200 for maintenaiu-a
anti $11,000 for repairs in excess of the budget
allowances of 1902-3.
Your committee also reminds your honorable
body that during the past fiscal year tha
Board of Health, In direct violation of the
civil service provisions of the charter, ap
pointed an officer with the title of deputy
warden and custodian.
In order to safeguard the civil service sys
tem the Finance Committee recommended an
Itemlzation of the hospital fund, segregating
the fund for salaries from the allowance for
maintenance. Thereupon the above-named
official ceased to be a deputy warden and cus
todian and became a head ward tender. There
would be no special interest in this wer* it
not that the salary of the head ward tenri-r
(SI6OO a year) la taken improperly from the
fund allowed for maintenance, and diminishes
the fund available for vegetables and fruits
by $1500.
Grades were ordered changed and es
tablished on Bache, Porter, Roscoe
and Benton streets.
The Board of Works reported that
It would be compelled to lay off a
number of mechanics In the Bureau of
Building unless an additional allow
ance of $5000 is made. The petition
was referred to the Finance Commit
tee, as well as the one for $576 addi
tional to an appropriation of $10,000
to build an engine house on Twenty
sixth avenue and $500 to make altera
tions in the secretary's office.
A petition of the West of Castro j
Club that Twenty-third street be
tween Diamond and Douglass be made
passable was referred to the Street [
Committee. The club says it has ap- :
pealed In vain to the Board of Works
to afford relief.
The City Attorney was asked for an
opinion whether the city is liable for
the expense of paving Point Lobos
avenue with bitumen.
The Board of Works was authorized
to expend the sum of $4500 to con
struct a concrete parapet on grade
from the beach to the Cliff House.
The width of sidewalks on Califor
nia street from Presidio avenue to
Thirty-third avenue was fixed at fif
teen feet.
To Distribute Bliss Estate.
George D. Bliss Jr., as administra
tor of the estate of his father, George

tate, which is valued at nearly $400,
000. Nearly all of the property is in
extensive ranch lands in Tulare, San
Mateo, Merced and Madera counties,
and through the purchase of the in
terest of the other heirs the greater
portion of the estate will go to George
and Richard O. Bliss, his brother. The
young men deeded the San Francisco

The Electro- Chemio treatment has a wonder-
ful curative enTiat In apeclol diseases of
women. It cures these bad diseases when the
ordinary medical treatments do them no good.
It cures bad cases that are turned over to thÂ«
surgeon for treatment by the family doctor
because the family doctor falls to cure them
with medicines. There Is too much fiurgiaal
treatment upon women. Electro-chemistry la
taking the place of surgery In very serious
rases, and is curing the**, bad cases quickly,
painlessly and cheaply, thus saving sufterlns;
women the horrors and dangers and the great
expense of surgical treatment. No womu
should consent to the use of the knife until
she has at least Investigated what this won-
derful new Electro-Chemlc treatment will do
for her. Right here in San Francisco, many
happy woman have been cured by Electro-
chemistry after having been told that surgery
was the only treatment that con Id cure them.
Many have given public testimonials of their
cures. To all suffering women, the Electro-
Chemlc specialists extend a cordial Invitation
to come for a thorough Electro-Chemlc exami-
nation free of charge. This examination will
at least tell what can be done an 1 whether
or not surgical treatment must be resorted to.
This examination Is free and in many serious
cases it will show the sufferers a pleasant way
to health and strength and save them front
the knife. All sufferers are Invited to call at
the Blectro-Chemic Institute for free consul-
tation and examination. ETlectro-Chemlstry is
the surest, safest, quickest and therefore the
cheapest treatment known for the cure of
catarrh, consumption. asthma, bronchitis,
deafness, ringing ears, cancers, tumors,
eczema, blood poison, skin diseases, rheu-
matism, neuralgia, locomotor a tax la." paral-
ysis, dizziness, fainting spells, special dis-
eases of menâ stricture, varicocele. loss at
strength, nerve exhaustion, etc. The Electro-
Chamlc home treatment is the most successful
because the patient is loaned, tree of charge. a
complete Electro-Chemie apparatus with which
the treatment la applied at home. Those per-
sons living at a distance who can conveni-
ently call for the personal examination should
do so. In the majority of cases the patient
can return home the same lay, taking the
necessary treatment along. Those who cannot
possibly come for the personal examination
should write a careful description of their
symptoms and receive, free of charge, full In-
structions for home examination and treat-
ment. The Electro-Chemie Institute Is the
only institution of this character on the. Pacific
Coast and Is centrally located at 113 Grant
avenue, corner of Post street. San Francisco.

RUSSIAN CRITICISM.
THE Novoe Yremya. an official organ at St. Petersburg, is much
pleased at the disagreement of the Senate with President Roose
velt over the arbitration treaties, and improves the occasion by
iag American diplomacy. Among the things to which it ob-
Secretary Hay? note on the neutrality of China, and his de
mand 'that the administrative entity of that empire be respected in
ihe present war.
It may be said in charity for the St. Petersburg paper that it
American diplomacy because it cannot understand it. It is a
irait of the ignorant and superstitious that they either fear or laugh
ai what they cannot comprehend. The Russian idea of diplomacy is
the antithesis of the American. The Russian idea has succeeded in
all dealings with the khanates, by which they were cheated and
finally overrun, and it had a successful career in Eastern Asia until
encountered the Japanese, who replied to its paltering and false
hood by sinking a* Russian fleet at Port Arthur and defying the
nations to join issues in battle.
The incidents and instances of Russian diplomacy in Eastern
are quite fresh in the memory of the worid. She found Ul the
r rebellion an excuse to send an army south of tiie Amur River
to join the forces of toe concerted powers and move to the relief of
the legoi Vking. After that relief was accomplished the for
eign Mir Peking representing the concerted powers, in con
junction with the military commanders, made an agreement to
evacuate Chinese soil at a fixed date. This agreement was made
upon diplomatic honor and also upon military honor. Japan ob
served it, so did Great Britain. France, Germany, the United States
and every nation concerned, except Russia. She kept her army on

for evacuation, all of which she violated.
The purpose of this perfidy, this diplomatic and military dis
v. as disclosed when our Minister, Mr. Conger, notified his
( lovernment that Russia was trying to make a secret treaty^ by
5, with China, using the presence of her army on Chinese soil
DC the empire into the compact. Upon receipt of this informa
tion our Government protested, whereupon the Russian Minister for
zn Affairs. Count Lamsdorf. ordered his diplomatic represen
tative at Washington. Count Cassini, to deny that any such treaty
Jiad been proposed, and to impeach the veracity of Mr. Conger. Fol
lowing this the Chinese Foreign Office furnished Mr. Conger with
an authenticated copy of the proposed treaty and a statement of the
coercive means used by Russia to compel assent to it by the Chinese
Government.
Now this series of events proved Russia to be destitute of diplo
matic and military honor, and to have descended to common lying
to impeach Minister Conger. Xot only to the United States, but to
oiher nations. Russia has disclosed this hardened disregard for truth
and honor in her diplomacy. The most recent instance was her en
tirely false charge that neutrality had been violated by China. Had
h not t>een for Secretary Hay that falsehood would have served as a
pretext for carrying the war over into Chinese territory, which was

'J he contrast between Russian and American diplomacy is
1. Secretary Hay stated the purpose of using our army" and
navy in the Boxer war on Chinese soil. Their use did not vary a
hair's breadth from that purpose. We left Chinese soil when "we
said we would. Secretary Hay wanted the open door policy in Chi
commerce. He said so to the other nations, and the open
door is there. He wanted safety and respect for Chinese jurisdiction
and territory in the present war. and said so. to the nations, and they
assented. American diplomacy is direct, frank and truthful, and
proceeds upon the fact that a straight line is the shortest distance
between two points. It has set the pace for the diplomacy of the
world. Russia will rage and go on insisting that a crooked line
ts the shortest distance between two points, but her style of diplo
macy is destined to disappear. Nobody believes anything that is
said either by her military or diplomatic representatives, and her
diplomatic and military honor is discredited and disbelieved. The
Novoe Yremya sneers at the President's "cornucopia of arbitration
treaties." Americans prefer it to Russia's Pandora's box of false
hoods, broken promises and perfidy.
TELEPHONES AND TELEGRAPHS.
A BULLETIN upon telephones and telegraphs, just issued by j
the Census Bureau, contains conclusive proof that these two j
inventions have passed beyond the range of conveniences and j
are now one of the absolute necessities of modern urban life. Leav- I
ing railroads out of consideration, there is no other common commod
ity that commands such a wide range of use or that answers so gen- ;
erally the demands of business and everyday affairs. Electric light
and electric traction have not the grip upon present day necessity
that these two contrivances for the speedy transmission of thought
hold.
Thomas Commerford Martin, the compiler of these statistics, es
timates that in the year 1902, for instance, there were no less than
5.000.000.000 telephone conversations carried on over the countless
wires throughout the country. In 1880 the census recorded
that there were 348 exchanges in the . land ; in 1902 there
were 10,361. At the time when the latest figures were
taken there were 2,315,297 telephone appliances in use. or one
for every thirty-four inhabitants of the nation. In fact, the telephone
is rapidly overshadowing the telegraph in general utility. The for
mer interest was represented in 1902 by an outlay of $348,000,000
capital as against $163,000,000 invested in the latter. The telephone
gave employment to 64,628 wage earners, and the telegraph to 24,978.
The telephone has in use four times as many miles of wire as its
companion contrivance.
The preponderance of general use which the telephone enjoys is
in large measure due to the specialized functions given it in the con
duct of large city systems. Mutual exchanges between business
houses, the connection of departments of one large concern by tele
phonic communication and kindred elaborations upon the original
function of the instrument have all made it one of the prime factors
of industrial and social life to-day.
KILLING WOMEN.
IN the last two months the papers have recorded the murder and
attempted murder of a score of women, either by jealous suitors
or beastly husbands/ To offset this only one woman was handy
enough with the pistol to put the man out first. In most of these
cases the same dismal story is told of the fool man threatening to
kill the woman, and she. foolish on her part, neglecting to have him
put under restraint.
It is time that lawmakers and the medical profession combined
in recognition of this furor that attacks a certain sort of men. When
one makes threats to kill a woman unless she marry or elope with
him it should be classified as a special kind of crime, and be pun
ished with the utmost severity. Such creJtures deserve, and should
have, no mercj\
It is a form of crime that seems to be upon the increase. It
â¢ruck down victims that had never desired nor encouraged the
attentions that end in murder. Good wofnen are made the prey of
erotic fools, who force their presence upon them. Existing law is
rot sufficient to restrain or punish these creatures. We beg fo suÂ«*
hat the women voters in the States that have female suffrage
can find in this matter a legitimate object of attention. Having the
ballot, they can use it. if they will, to secure legislation that will be
gladly followed in the non-suffrage States. The crime is getting to
be the odium of our civilization. It is so common that there :s: s a
feeling of approval when a woman successfully 9onducts her own
defense with a gun.
THE SAN -FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21. 1905.
The Runaway
IZOLA FORRESTER
"I want you to take Kleanor
home to Airslie. BUI."
CÂ£. I ANT to see Mr - Mac Donald
*â¢ I now, please."
; The girl stopped short in front
â  of Caxton's desk, alert and
slightly aggressive. Caxton cut
short his dictating and turned toward
her with courteous attentiveness and
inward annoyance. Many persons
wished to see Mr. Mac Donald ânow.
The position of private secretary to
Mr. Mac Donald required many diplo
matic dodges and evasions. At first
sight of the girl's face he was on his
feet, looking down at her with eager,
longing recognition.
â¢Billy!"
She said it softly. It would never
do to let the stenographer guess just
how much it meant to her to see Billy
at that moment, but perhaps Billy
knew. Hf was a goose if he did not,
with her looking into his eyes in the
old, glad way, and her lips smiling a
tremulous welcome at him.
Caxton's hand gripped the side of
his desk. He tried to keep steady, to
remember all that might have hap
pened in three years, but all he could
say was:
"You've come back."
"Back forevermore." All her heart
was in her voice. "Where's papa. I
didn't know that you were here."
Caxton ignored her last remark, but
it brought him up short from the rose
colored dreams of three years ago.
"Mr. Mac Donald is in his private
office. Doesn't he expect you?"
"No, he doesn't." She hesitated
with laughing nervousness. "I'm not
sure of a welcome even. Ive â Billy
I've run away."
"Run away? From Airslie?" He
had not even heard she was home.
She shook her head.
"Not Airslie. I haven't been home
at all. I only landed this afternoonâ
on the 'Cedric' You remember old
Fanny, mamma's maid? She is with :
me. And I've run away from mamma
and Europe, and Deighton."
'*>fighton? I thoughtâ" He
stopped short.
"I know. Everybody thought so.
So did mamma. So did Deighton.
But I knew, you see." She raised her
fhin with the delicious air of authority
he knew so well, and as their glances
met her own was full, of sudden en
treaty. "Billy, I couldlh't stay over
there. You ought to see him. And
you know mamma. Jf I had stayed
she would have tumbled me overboard
sure as fate. So I simply ran away."
An electric button buzzed impa
; tiently at Caxton's desk, and he
: glanced toward the door of the pri
i vate office.
FASHION'S MIRROR
Shewing a modish evening cbpe in pastel blue broadcloth,
trimmed with shirring and ruffles of Luuisinc silk the same
shade. Velvet buttons and silk cord ornaments complete the
adornment.
"Shall I tell him you are here?"
"No. I want to surprise him. You
stay right here, Billy. I'll answer
that."
The man in the private room did not
turn at the opening of the door.
"Call up Judd and Holmes. Caxton.
Tell Judd I'm not in town. You don't
know anything about the M. K. stock
if he asks you."
Eleanor walked quickly over to the
j desk and folded her arms around his
j neck and laid her cheek to his.
"Hello, papa," she said softly.
Mac Donald jumped from his chair.
She felt her first shock of shyness as
he faced her. He certainly was not
glad to see her. In fact, he looked be
yond her at the door, with anything
but a pleasurable expectancy.
"Where's your mother?"
"In London, with old Lady Deigh
1 ton."
His brow cleared, and he looked at
I his daughter with more attention. It
i was three years since he had seen
[ either her or her mother. He had
never denied to himself that their de
parture had been a relief. While there
had been no trouble, as the world
views domestic trouble, there had cer
tainly been incompatibility of temper
in large doses, and Mrs. Mac Donald's
sudden decision that Eleanor needed
Continental finish had been a most
welcome peg on which to hang the
argument. The one great shock of
KleanQr's reappearance had been the ]
fear of the argument's immediate dis- I
lodgment from its peaceful peg of |
neutrality.
Eleanor gripped her gloves tightly. 1
If only he would look a little pleasant.
She plunged ahead recklessly.
"I didn't come over alone, papa. I
brought Fanny with me. Mamma
doesn't know that I'm here. Oh, I
please don't. Not just yeit," as her j
father looked up to speale. "Please
vÂ«it till I tell you. I know it was a
terrible thing, but it was all I could
do. Mamma had even set the day of
the wedding, and I hadn't accepted
him yet."
"Accepted who?"
"Why, you know, Deighton.
Mamma's little Lord Deighton."
Mac Donald shook his head in dis
sent.
"Your mother has not seen fit to
keep me posted on current events in
Europe," he said.
"We met him last winter in Lon
don," Eleanor went on. "Mamma
simply grabbed at him. He was
brand new, and had only just come
into the title. And mamma told him
all about us, or at least she told old
Lady Lelghton, his mother, and how
you were gotfd for a couple of million
anyway, and they fixed it up. So you
see there wasn't anything for me to
do but run away."
MacDonfl.ld did not speak for an in^
stant. He wanted to laugh. If ' had
been possible, he would have enjoyed
parting with a small portion of that
couple of million he was good for to
have seen Mrs. Mac Donald's expres
sive face when she found her plans
had gone astray. As for the girl, he
regarded her with a new sense of
helplessness. He had never been an
expert at dealing with the intricacies
and eccentricities of the feminine
character. â¢
"Papa, I saw Billy Caxton out in
the office. What is he doing here?"
"Caxton went under". Bill's earning
a living at present. I wouldn't rattle
him if I were you. He needs a level
head for a few years."
"And you are helping him?" Her
voice was eager.
"He doesn't need much help: only
a chance. The boy will land on his I
feet. Caxton died."
"Oh!" Elennor drew in her breath
sharply. They had been in trouble,
and she had not known it. Billy
mi^ht have written. He had never
written to her at all. Suddenly the
remembrance of the look in his eyes
returned to her. He thought it would
make a difference to her. She gath- j
ered her courage to the point of ac- j
tion.
"Papa, I think you ought to knowâ Â»
I don't know whether you do or not.
Perhaps you do, and that's why you're 1
good to Billy." She came over to his j
chair and perched herself on its arm
as she used to do three years before. )
"I like Billy, and I know he cares for 1
me. He told me so three years ago. j
I promised him then there would
' never be any one else. That's why I

THE MIRROR'S PHILOSOPHY
A mirror met, by chance, a window
pane.
"Good friend." the latter begged, "can
you explain
Why our good mistress lavishes on you
Such loving care and such devotion true.
While I. though ever eager for a chance
To serve, am seldom favored with a

"The reason, gossip, is not far to seek,"
Replied the mirror as he rose to speak:

A DOCTOR ON AUTOMOBILES
I know of no reason why a man or
woman, with average intelligence,
sound limbs and good vision, should
not be able to successfully pilot an au
tomobile over our ordinary country
roads or city streets. It is remarkable
how quickly one's timidity vanishes
and how soon we attain a feeling of
confidence. As we learn our machine
we find that it is easy to control and
simple to manage. The nervous pa
tient, no matter how timid, need not
fear to take the first lesson at the
steering wheel; what appears to be dif
ficult and perplexing at first soon be
comes easy and fascinating. A good
deal of nonsense has been written
about the strenuous automobile face,
and the effects of wind and dust upon
the eyes and lungs.
Most of the faces I notice in the au
tomobiles that pass reflect content
ment and happiness. There is nothing
depressing or particularly strenuous
about riding in or driving a motor car
at a respectable gait, even through
the crowded streets. â lÂ»eslie's

ran away, dear. I wanted you and
Billy. Now, won't you let me stay?"
Mac Donald pushed the electric hut~
ton under his desk. Caxton entered
the room.
"I want you to take Eleanor home
to Airslie, Bill. You may telephone
out for them to have things ready.
She Is not going back to Europe. I'll
be out on the 6:45. I am going to
cable Mrs. Mac Donald."
He kissed Eleanor and went out of
the office, shutting the door after
him.
Caxton waited. He was not sure.
Three years is a long time. Eleane^
raieed her tear-wet lashes and looked
at him.
"Must I say it again, Billy?" shÂ»
asked, and throwing Judgment to the
winds, Billy took the figure in brown
close in his arms.
"Say it again," he said.
Europe was far away. Eleanor
leaned her head back on his shoulders
and smiled up at him.
"There isn't anybody else in all the
world," she said.

tatiye to Capital to Fight
the School Apportionment
The Board of Supervistors yesterday
authorized the Finance Committee to
employ H. A. Mason to go to Sacra
mento to oppose, on behalf of the city,
the passage of the bill now before the
Legislature changing the method of
apportioning the school funds, which
will result in a loss of $250,000 in the
revenue of the local school department.
Another bill introduced by Senator
Keane fixing a minimum tax for
schools, which will cost San Fran
cisco $500,000, will also t>e opposed.
A communication- was received from
President Roncovieri of the Board of
Education calling attention to the fact
that the vote on the final passage of
the bills changing the apportionment
of State school funds would come up
in the Assembly on Tuesday afternoon
and in the Senate on Wednesday
afternoon.
Brandenstein criticized Roncovieri
for having withdrawn his opposition to
the bills. The criticism drew forth a
reply from Gallagher, who warmly de
fended Roncovieri for his original
efforts to defeat the bill, which, how
ever, were futile. Roncovieri. how
ever, agreed to a compromise that the
bill go into effect in September instead
of July. â¢
Braunhart said that if Roncovieri
had withdrawn hisÂ«opposition with the
understanding that he was the official
representative of the city the state

BACOME'S BATH
ISSUE IN COURT
Wife of a Week Leaves Him
Because of Alleged Aver
sion to Soap and Water
DEFENDS HIS HABITS
Sister-in -Law Says the Old
liackman Is as Cleanly
as borne Other Persons
A widow, the mother of a married
daughter, became the bride of a man |
of tja, the hale survivor of two mat
; imonial ventures. The wedding was !
celebrated on August 31 last and a
week later the disappointed lady went j
back to live with her daughter. The '
gray-haired groom immediately in- j
serted a notice in the papers that he :
would not be liable for his wife'a bills ;
and^then he sued her for divorce, al
leging cruelty and desertion. She filed
a cross-complaint, in which she told <
of the uncleanliness of her spouse, i
Yesterday the trial was begun before '
Judge Hunt.
William Bacome, a hackman, who !
has accumulated a fortune of $20,000, j
is the plaintiff and in telling the court j
of his bride's desertion he said it had j
so sorrowed him that he suffered for :
the first time in his life from heart ;
trouble and sleeplessness. He had not I
been so affected when his former ,'
wives died and he said, "I'm the fair
est man to a wife in California."
Kit Bacome's story had to do with ;
uncleanliness and impolite table man
ners. She declared that Bacome told
her he had not bathed in thirty years ,
and the reason that she did not dis- ;
cover this before she married him was â¢
because he kept his face clean and ,
used perfume when he came courting.
The bath story was denied by Annie
McGee, who said that she kept house
for Bacome, being his sister-in-law, I
and she prepared water for his ablu
tions once a week. The case will be
argued this morning.
Judge Seawell yesterday granted a
divorce to Harry J. Pfiel from Jennie
E. Pfiel on a cross-complaint. The
wife sued in August, 1902, charging her
husband with having choked her. He
pleaded justification and said that she
left home and associated too freely
with one S. W. Shippuld, who was
also known by five other names. A
cross-complainant was also successful â 
in Judge Troutt's court. Maud P. Dix
sued Charles W. Dix for divorce for
cruelty, and in return he charged her
with infidelity with a soldier named
Bert Pfeiffer, proving the case.
Other decrees of separation were
granted as follows: By Judge Sloss to
Emma M. White from Dan White,
cruelty; by Judge Murasky to Sarah
J. Wheeler from George S. Wheeler,
desertion; to Grace M. Lowry from
William R. Lowry, desertion; by Judge
Graham to Susie F. Schanbacher from
Albert Schanbacher, cruelty; to Ger
trude Freese from Charles W. Freese,
neglect: by Judge Kerrigan to J. Wini
fred Butler from Clyde H. Butler, de
sertion; by Judge Hebbard to Helen
R. Peck from George G. Peck, deser
tion.
Nathan Cantor, a young hat factory
employe who was married two days
before last Christmas, yesterday asked
the court to annul the union because
his wife, Lottie, is in the last stages
of consumption. Since the wedding
sho has been sent to a hospital and is
now in Arizona seeking to prolong her
days. H> r condition was not made
known to her husband until it was too
late.
Amy N. Biggs, who married Frank
P. O'Neill on November 26 last, has
discovered that he has another wife
living and has feued for an annulment
â if her unfortunate union.
In July' las=t at Oakland Harry L,.
Hathaway married. He filed a suit for
divorce yesterday on the ground of
cruelty.
Othor actions to sever the ties of
thr unhappily wedded were begun by
William H.-rriman against Fanny Her
rimon, desertion; Isabel McMillan
against Alfred McMillan, cruelty;
Amelia E. Keser against Alfred S.
Koser. desertion; Elizabeth o. Hoev
elcr against William K. Hopveler, cru
elty; Mary D. Newton against Wil

Elreavy against Daniel McElreavy, de
sertion: Willis I. Hall against Annie
Hall, desertion; William H. Benson
against Myrtle M. Benson, cruelty. In
the later case the couple were married
two months ago and twice since then,
says the husband, the wife has re
mained from home all night.
i;i.i-ati:s EXPERIENCES
WITHIN PRISON WAI;I>S
Mrs. Rnllington Booth Says Her Kf
forts to Save the Sinful Have
B6M Fruitful.
Mrs. Ballington Booth, commander
of thf> Volunteers of America, and
justly entitled to all the reputation she
has gained for brilliant oratory, met
and addressed a gathering of her sex
in the red room of the St. Francis
Hotel yesterday afternoon on prison
work, to which she has been devoting
the greater part of her attention dur
ing the last ten years. Though the
attendance was not as large as had
been expected, the fact did not lessen
Mrs. Booth's enthusiasm in her dis
cussion, which deeply Interested her
audience.
She prefaced her remarks with a
story of how one day in New York
she received a bunch of pretty flowers,
the petals of which had been bruised
by careless handling, and how she had
watched them discolor and wither and
finally revive under her care. . From
these flowers, the speaker said, she
had gained her first inspiration in the
work that she had later undertaken.
As in the case of withered flowers,
Mrs. Booth said, there is a bud â a bud
of hope â in the unfortunate men be
hind prison walls, and it only needs
gentle care to revive the victims of sin
to a life of purity. She told of the
many thousands of seemingly helpless
creatures she had met in the peniten
tiaries in this country, and of the suc
cess that had attended her efforts and
those of -her religious followers in
bringing the minds of these men into
a hopeful mood so that they might
ltad better lives upon their release
and regain the confidence and sym
pathy of their fellow men.
Cnlor Begins Arguments,
The arguments on the motions to
dismiss or arrest the proceedings be
fore Jud??e Lawlor on the accusation
charging the Election Commissioners
with misfeapance in office and on the
demurrer to the accusation were be
gun yesterday afternoon. Attorney
Cator for the defendants argued at
length that the proceedings before the
Mayor against the Commissioners took
the case out of the Jurisdiction of
the court. 9Â» by the charter the Major
was clothed with the sole nower to
remove officials from office. Further
intent was continued till Thursday

PRIMARY
ELECTION
LAW VALID
Supreme Court Eefuses to
Issue a Writ Prohibiting
Judge W. P. Lawlor From
Trying Joseph Rebstock
JUSTICE AXGELLOTTI
WRITES THE OPINION
Accused 31 ay Yet Escape Con
viction by Pleading as
Defense That He Testified
Before the Grand Jury
Five Justices of the Supreme Court
declare that the primary election law
Is constitutional. This decision about
settles the fate of Charles Wyman and
Adolph Steffens. Joseph Rebstock, the
third member of the ballot-box stuffing
trio, may escape on a technicality.
.The opinion was rendered in answer
to Rebstock's petition for a writ of
prohibition to restrain ' Judge ; Lawlor
from trying him on the charge of re
fusing to perform his duties as an elec
tion officer in the Almshouse precinct
at the primary election | last August.
After an elector had been challenged
Rebstock should have made the ' man
make his statement under oath, but
this the petitioner categorically de
clined to do in the case at bar. .
The accused election officer was sum
moned before the Grand Jury and after
telling his story was indicted. He was
arraigned in Judge Lawlor's court and
was about to be placed on .trial when
the matter was carried to the Supreme
Court on a petition ; for a writ of pro
hibition. Meanwhile proceedings in the
lower tribunal have been stayed.
ADVANCES TWO /ARGUMENTS.
Rebstock's attorney presented two
arguments in defense of the claim that
the trial should not be allowed to con
tinue. The first was that the election
officer's confession before the Grand
Jury was a bar to . prosecution, the
other that the primary election law
was unconstitutional. The first argu
ment was baaed on section 64 of the
Political Code, which says:
No person otherwise competent as a wlt
nesft shall be disqualified or excused from tes
tifying concerning any of the offenses enum
erated and prescribed in this .title, on the
ground that such testimony may crimlate
himself; but no prosecution can afterward be
had against such witness for! any such offense
concerning which he testified for the prosecu
tion.
The court says the section quoted
may ,we,ll serve the - petitioner as a
defense like the statute of limitations,
but it is not a bar to prosecution. It j
is said that the writ of prohibition
would lie' in a case where some court
had exceeded its jurisdiction, but such
was not the case in the oresent in
stance. When Rebstock is placed on
trial he may plead in defense that his I
testimony before the Grand Jury;
shouhl save him, and' the question may '
come again before the Supreme Court
on an appeal from a possible convic
tion. The Justices refuse, ' however, '; to
grant the writ of prohibition because
there is no legal ground for it in the
proceeding considered. '.;J
PRIMARY LAW IS VALID.,
Rebstock's second, claim of ground
tor, release was based on the alleged
unconstitutionally of the; rules govern
ing the , primary election â¢ law. The
court answers this argument briefly as
follows:
It is suggested that the Indictment falls to
Mate a public offense, for the reason that the
oath which the defendant omitted and re
fused to administer is in violation of section
5, article. II of j the constitution of California,
which provides as follows: "All elections- by
; the people phall be by ballot or by such other
method as may be prescribed by law; provided,
that secrecy In voting be preserved." Tho oath
mentioned. Â» to be taken by a voter challenged
on the ground that he has not a bona-flde
present intention of supporting the nominees of
the party, in whose nomination convention he
seeks to participate,, by voting for delegates
thereto, is one to the effect that* he has â 
present bona-flile Intention to support. the nom
inees of such convention. Assuming that the
question thus raised is one that may be prop
erly determined In. this proceeding- it Is mani
fest that" there is nothing in the point thus
made.
TEST IS PROPER.
! By' section 2% of the same, article 'of the
constitution, adopted In the year 1900, the Leg
islature is . expressly empowered to determine
the tests and conditions upon which the electors
may participate in any primary election, and
1 there is nothing ill a provision enacted by the
Legislature In pursuance of this authority re
quiring one seeking to participate in such an
flection as a member of any particular party
to openly declare his .allegiance to such party,
! which in any degree violates the, constitutional
I provision Invoked. .
! Such a declaration â¢is absolutely essential
'to the: proper -working, of -any primary law..
Hy his mere offer. to vote for delegates to a
convention of any party tne elector does, in
. effect declare . his ; intention to â  support' the
nominees of such convention, and the oath ' 15
provided for as a guarantee of the truth of the
declaration already made by such offer to
' vote. â  -. -" ,'.v>\ *- ; : '-"".'â ' ! i : -\\:' {

SAYS ATTORNEY
DECEIVED HIM
Isaac Selby Calls Judge's
Attention to a Matter and
Demands Legal Discipline
TROUBLE ABOUT MONEY
Asks Permission to '{Defend
Himself at His Trial for
Assault to Commit Murder
Tsaac Selby, who fired a shot at
Judge J. C. B. Hebbard in his court
room on November 28, created a scene
in Judge Lawlor's court yester4ay
morning. His case was on the calen
dar for trial and when it was called
Selby stood up in the dock and said:
"I wish to call your attention to a
matter that reauires legal discipline.
I had told my attorney not to com
municate with my friends, asking for
money, but I find that he has done so.
He got Â£5, which I allowed him to
keep, but since then he has got Â£13
more, which he has kept without my
consent. The law gives me the right
to defend myself, and as I have lost
confidence in my attorney I wish to
dispense with his services, and I will
conduct my own defense."
The Judge replied that as an at
torney had been representing Selby
the right he claimed had been in a
measure withdrawn. The attorney,
W. G. Deal, who had been appointed
by the court, was a bright young man
and the Judge said he had every con
fidence in him.
Assistant District Attorney Ferral
said that as he understood the defense
would endeavor to prove insanity, the
defendant could hardly represent him
self. He agreed with the Judge that
Attorney Deal would look properly
after the defendant's interests.
By consent the case was continued
fyr two weeks ,and at that time it will
bje again continued, as a commission
has been appointed to take the testi
rriony of persons in New Zealand and
Australia on the question of the de
fendant's sanity. It will take three or
four months before the report of the
commission is received.
VISITOR FROM COUNTRY
L/OSES WEDDING DRESS
Loaves Card Box Containing: It at
Ferry by Mistake, and Some
One Steals It.
B. C. Crawford of Posteria. Cala
veras County, has asked the aasistance
of the police in getting him out of an
awkward predicament. He came to
the city to purchase a wedding 1 dress
for a young lady who would soon be
his wife. The dress, a tan colored
silk, cost him $75. He was at the
ferry on Sunday morning on his way
back to Fosteria and had the wedding
dress in a card box.
When he reached the Oakland mole ,
he discovered to his dismay that he
had forgotten all about the box which
he had left in the waiting room at the
ftrry. He took the same boat back
to the city, but when he rushed into
the waiting room the package had dis
appeared. Captain Burnett has de
j tailed Detectives Conlon and McGowan '
on the case.
Another victim of a thief at the
ferry on Sunday was Benjamin Gear
McDougall of Fresno. He had occa
sion to leave his grip for a moment
and when he returned it was gone. It
contained-* few personal effects and
a bank book.
Saves Two Children.
The prompt action of Christopher
Ward, a 15-year-old boy living at
529 1/21 /2 Bryant street, saved the lives of
Martin Pelahanty, a small boy resid
ing at 505 Fourth street, and Irene
Klipstein. who lives near Zoe and
Bryant streets. The children fell into
a smnll pond in the basement of a
new- building at Bryant and Zoe
streets last Saturday and would have
drowned but for young Wards com
ing to their rescue.

LEVY DENIES THAT HE
RECEIVES CONTRIBrTIOXS
Deputy Health Officer Resents Charge
of Supervisors That Fellow Em
ployes Make Up His Salary.
Deputy Health Officer Louis I>vy
denies the charge made by the Fin
ance Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors that he Is being: paid a
monthly sum by several physicians In
the Health Department, owingr to the
fact that his salary is being: held up
pending a decision of the Superior
Court as to the validity of his employ
ment. The committee was prepared
to begin an investigation into the mat
ter at its meeting yesterday, but the
presence of newspaper reporters for
some reason prevented the inquiry.
Levy was present and anxious to deny
the charge, which he declares to be
not founded on fact. The inquiry was
indefinitely postponed. Speaking of
the matter. Levy said:
The Finance Committee thinks it has dis
covered that my salary is being made up by
monthly contributions from other employes of
the Health Department. Tne charge ta absurd,
and is evidently made to prejudice the case
now before Judge SlosÂ», involving the legality
of appointments by the Health Board. When
the case was on trial evidence was given that
I was obliged to borrow money from A. Ruef
and others, in view of the fact that I was not
permitted to draw my salary. I also do some
outside work for newspaper, and In that way
pay my personal expenses, despite the holding
up of my salary which I am earning from
the city. Not one of the physicians of the
Health Board 4a making me any monthly dona
tion, and I am prepared to show the Finance
Committee that its charge is absolutely false.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 20â The stock market
ripmiustrated again to-day in a iking man
n<r its power o* resistance against adverse In
fl'ieners such as would have worked decisive
ly Ear a reaction in periods of past specula
tive activity. Ev*n the traditional prejudice
esamst high and active opening on Monday
morning -proved of no effect, although there
Â».is hesitation in this connection after the

we? retum-d at mÂ» points and the strength
of the market established mor* decidedly than
befote. The incst obvious vi the influences
against the market was the rather discour
aging condition of th-e country's transporta
tion, discovered with weekly talks with traf
fic officials. This, following paralysis by
FTorni and blockades on many lines east and
west, and while progress was reported to
ward br^akinc the blockades it was not likely
thÂ«t normal conditions would be restored for
n *ny tv-epki. A still further cut was made
in 'he rates for export grain. The gross
earnings of the second week of February
ehowen already quite clearly the effect of thes*
influences. Thesp wore the cause of a halting
an<S tlugglsh response to the first buoyant rise
in Union Pacific. Th* n- xt demonstration cen
tered in ite industrials, and it, was not
until late in the day ihat the railroad stocks
centrally came up. The active list was large

eupposif.on induced other buying of the stock.
Report* of negotiations for the merger of
Southern Iron companies grew more explicit
and that group of stocks was strong in con
,vqnÂ»M. The taking over by the American
Â»Â»<difng Company of a mining corporation and
persistent assertions of a plan for compara
tive combination of Lead Interests explained
the strength of another group of stocks. Ru
mors of coming pcare were received from
abroad, and the continued decline in exchange
marked the culmination of the foreign demand

among stock exchange house* to take out

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. â At the opening the
vl;...at market showed some signs of firmness
in sympathy with higher prices at the last.
July was up %@V4c at $1 oi^gi 01%. May
was a shade higher to 14<H4c lower at $1 190
1 19>4. Crop damage reports from the West
formed the basis of strength in the wheat
market. Statistics were of a bearish nature.
The world's shipments were considerably in
excess of those a year ago, the amount of
wheat on passage showing an increase of over
two million bushels. Immediately after the
opening commission-houses began to sell May
and the price dropped to $1 18%. With short
covering the market gradually recovered. The
highest point of the day in May was reached
at $1 19%. During the last part of the s#s-,
Bion the market was affected by weakness/^lt
St. Louis and Minneapolis. Likelihood of an
ircrease in movement resulting from milder
weather was the main reason for lower prices
in outside markets. The close was rather
weak, with May off %@%c at $1 18%. After
touching: $1 01 % July closed }&c lower at
n oi?4.
A number of prominent commission-houses
were persistent sellers of corn throughout the
entire session. May closed %@Hc lower at
4(-W@4o%c . .
Oats were very quiet. May closed unchanged
at 30% c.
Provisions were a trifle easier owing to
liberal receipts of live hogs. May pork closed
6fr7V&c lower. lard and ribs were each off
a shade.

I Chicago was '-jc lower on the day. Brokers' '
, wires from there said: "It is the belief of
the trade that practically all of . the Wheat
j â¢old out by the bull clique on the bulge has
â  been taken back since. One expert" estimates
1 the visible and invisible supply in the Da- j
â¢ kota? and Minneapolis at only 56.000,000 bush- i
I els, against estimated milling requirements ;of )
! i,",(, 1 4 000 up to the sinning of the new crop. |
I This shortage would be 19,000,000 bushels if as
much Wheat were shipped from Duluth and
! Minneapolis and from Minnesota and South j
i Dakota to points as was shipped between Feb- ,
: ruary 1 ' and August 1 last year. It is claim- '
1 ed that only higher prices in the Northwest j
lean divert such a movement. Wheat prices j
' are now dangerously near an import basis.'" >

Poultry and Game.
Receipts of Poultry were only seven coops,
and as there was very little held-over stock on
hand the market was firm for all kinds. All
Indications point toward a firm market dur
ing the current week and most handlers are
expecting a higher range of prices for chick
ens. Thirteen cases of dressed Turkeys came
in and met with slow sale at easier prices,
all of the offerings being more or lesa
"grassy." Game was In good requeat an*
cleaned up readily at previous pricea.

Butter, Cheese and EggrÂ«.
Receipts of Butter and Eggs were both
liberal, but the market absorbed them very
well and continued in good Ehape for sellers.
Butter is now at a point where it is moving
off well, both lor local and shipping account,
and stocks are not accumulating. There la a
disposition to shade the asking prices for
Eggs owing to the soft, springlike weather,
but it has not resulted in any dtcline. An
other car was being made up for shipment
yesterday. Cheese is well cleaned up and firm.
Receipts were 59,000 lbs Butter, 762 cases
Eggs and 10.2H0 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The Orange market showed a little more
tone, the movement being stimulated somewhat
by the mild, sunny weather, but low prices
still ruled, as supplies of all grades exceeded
requirement?. The lower grades were the
best sellers, both In the open market and In
the auction rooms, and peddlers we're the
principal buyers. Ten carloads, chiefly stand
ards, were auctioned as follows: Fancy, $1 20
d I 06; choice. 90c@'$l 25; standard, 85c@$l.
The other Citrus fruits stood as previously

thing except Mexican Lime*, which were in

Late mail advice? from New York say of
Hops: "The mnrket continued to drag. The
advices received from uji the State an.| the
coast reported an abspnee of business due
to' the indifference shown by dealers, they gen
erally showing a disposition to hold off as
buyers and await developments. Locally,
business was reported as practically at a
standstill, dealers claiming it was extremely
difficult to interest brewers and that owing to
thf keen competition for business low prices
ha>l to be made to effect sales. Prices quoted
continued largely nominal. Foreign nurk-ts
were dull."

NOT LOOKING
FOR POISONER
PetoUifM Say Story of At
tompt to Kill Mrs Stan
ford Is Piece of Fiction
HOFF AT WILD TALES
Â¥mt> Strongly Contradict
Theory That Mineral Wa
ter (>)ntained Strychnine
Around the fact that Mrs. Jarre
Stanford, eight weeks ago, after par
taking of a hearty dinner given to sev
eral of her friends, quenched a natural
thirst with a glass of mineral water,
which is supposed to have been re
sponsible for a nauseating feeling: that
followed, there iÂ« being weaved a sen
sational story of an attempt to mur
der the generous-hearted woman.
Although no motive if= shown for
the supposed attempted destruction of
Mrs. Stanford, who has no enemies,
and although a thorough investigation
of the matter satisfactorily showed
that a J>lo't did not exist, there are
those who seem to think that the phil
anthropic lady really had a narrow
escape from death and they are sug
gesting all kinds of thories to support
their frensied imagination.
It was positively slated yesterday by
the detectives who worked on the case
that Â»Â»everal hours' labor proved to
them conclusively that no attempt had
been made to poison Mrs. Stanford
and. so advising her needlessly
alarmed servants. the detective*
d their work and later presented
their bill for one day's labor. Stories
told by tvo former servants of Mrs.
Stanford that a quantity of strych
nine, sufficient xo kill a dozen persons,
v>.Â»- found in the bottle of water from
*hioh Mrs. Stanford took a drink are
pronounced by the detectives as great
ly exaggerated. While it is admitted
that the water nauseated Mrs. Stan
ford fr>r a few minutes, it is possible,
so the detectives suggest, that this
fact wa6 due to an overloaded stom
ach, for the lady had an hour pre
viously eaten dinner with friends.
If. as it has been asserted, the bot
tle of mineral water contained the
amount of strychnine alleged Mrs.
Stanford would probably have fallen
writhing in pain on the floor and
would have felt the effects of the poi
son for a number of days. Instead,
however, she retired that evening ap
parently in the best of health and the
following day went to Palo Alto,
where she remained until a day or so
before the entertainment given at her
residence on California street. Upon
the latter occasion, which was ten days
after the supposed poisoning: episode.
Mrs. Stanford was In excellent health
and continued so for a number .of
day? longer, when she experienced a
recurrence of a bronchial trouble
lrom which she has been a sufferer
for many years and which was the
cause of her kin? her present trip
to Hawaii at the suggestion of her
physician. It was this annoying af
fection that caused her to abandon
the plans for formally introducing her
niece, Miss Jennie Lathrop, to society
at a party arranged for at the Califor
r.ia-street mansion.
The true reason for bringing detec
tives into the case was a simple one,
but unfortunately lent some color to
the original reports that Mrs. Stan
ford's life had been attempted. When
Mrs. Stanford and her private secre
tary, who also drank the mineral
water, complained of its peculiar taste,
they recalled the fact that they had a
large supply of it on hand and had
accustomed themselves to drinking it
regularly. It has occurred several
times in San Francisco that persons
have been poisoned by drinking vari
ous mineral waters, and remembering
one particular occasion about ten years
ago, when several prominent Pacific-
Union Club men were poisoned one day
by drinking a well-known water, Mrs.
Stanford concluded that it would be
advisable for her to inquire Into the
cause of the peculiar taste of the water
she was drinking.
Accordingly she turned the matter
over to the detective firm, which has
frequently done work for her. and
whatever anxiety she had entertained ;
was quickly dispelled. The story of the
alleged attempted poisoning, however.
v.as not sprung until the evening of
the day that she departed for Hono- !
lulu. It is said by those who profess
to know that the former servant who
Is taking a lively interest in the sen
sational story did not quit her em
ployer with the best of grace and has i
not attempted to disguise the fact that
she bears ill will toward . Stan
ford's secretary. Yesterday the detec
tives who worked on the case said that I
the matter was closed as far as they '
were concerned and that the report i
that they suspected any one of an at- '
tempt to injure Mrs. Stanford or had.
been shadowing any one in connection' ,
with the matter was absolutely false. I

" DAQO RED " DEFINED
â¦
CEREMONY OF " CHASING THE
DUCK" ELUCIDATED TO JUDGE
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Mrs. Mary Sands of 140 Francisco
street. North Beach district, told Po
lice Judge GabanlÃS that she did not
start the argument that resulted In
her arrest on the charge of having dis
turbed the peace of Mrs. May Allen.
"I was chaÂ«in' th' duck," she said,
"when Mrs. Allen, with a jimmejohn
of da*ro red in her hand, met me on
the street an' gave me a tongue
lashin*."
""Who owned the bird you were pur
suing?" the court inquired.
Mrs. Sands gazed pityingly at his
Honor as she elucidated. â¢'Chasm' th'
duck."' she said, "means rushin" th'
growler. I have th' can in my hand
an' I'm goin' to th' Dutchman's to get
beer when up comes Mrs. Allen with
her jimmejohn of dago red an' â "
'May I interrupt you to ask what
"dago red" is?"
"(Vrtalnly. Dago red is cheap claret.
Well, she cuts loose on me with her
tongue, sayin" that any one that'd
drink beer must have a low taste, an'
she calls me this an' that an' th' other
thing."
"And you retaliated in kind?'
"I couldn't stand everything, of
course. Th' names I called her were
no wurse than th 'names she called
me."
Master Eddie O'Connor, age nine,
<-<->rroboratPd Mrs. Sands' statement as
to th' 3 txchange of billingsgate, but
was not certain ap to' who opened the
duel. Then the case was continued
one calendar month in order to afford
the ladies time to forgive and forget.
"I'll appeal this case to a higher
court, mister." shouted Abraham
Dirolf, big and burly and red-faced,
when Judge t'onlan pronounced him
guilty of begging and sentenced him
to thirty days' imprisonment.
"I hope you will," said his Honor,
"and that the higher court will give
you six months."
Dirolf was soliciting alms from
householders on Fulton street, between
Scott and when Patrolman
Burdett arrested him and found $1 30
in his possession.
For conducting an unlicensed "nig
ger doll game" in his shooting gallery
at Forty-nin.th avenue and B street,
William Galehouse was arraigned be-
Cbrf Judge Mogan and his case
continued till to-day. Patrolman
â¢ ii'CÃains testified that the game con
; of a number of black-faced pup
pets set up to be bombarded with base
balls by persons who paid for the
privilege and won prizes proportionate
in value to the number of dolls pros
trated by each shot. Prosecuting At
torney Creeley evidently was thinking
of Ibsen when he addressed Mr. Gale
house as "Mr. Dollphouse."
Mrs. Julia Ileo of 323 Montgomery
iiviiiie averred that her new hat was
worth ?30 of any lady's money ere it
waa violently plucked from her head
by Mrs. Amelia Ritzier, but the treat
ment to which it was subjected by the
angered despoiler ruined its shape and
irrf;>:ir; hly ruffled its plumage. Mrs.
Buzier. who was charged with battery
by Mrs. Ileo. laughed the complain
ant's appraisement to scorn and called
Mrs. Annie Eremita, a millinery ex
pert, to justify the sneering disclaimer.
Mrs. Eremita said that the original
cost of the hat did not exceed fIQ and
th;u the feathers added to it by Mrs.
Ileo were few and of inferior quality
and did not elevate the total value of
tbt headgear to more than $15, which
sum, indeed, would be difficult to otK
tain for it at this, time, when new
style Easters are mostly in demand.
Judge Cabaniss is giving himself am
ple time to determine just to what ex
tent the value of the damaged hat
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1905.
should be permitted to affect the
charge of battery.
Walter Plunkett, a discharged
solÃier, stood stiffly at attention and
saluted Judge Fritz a la mllitalre as
he pleaded not guilty of disturbing the
peace of the Presidio reservation.
Since his retirement from Uncle Sam's
service he has apparently been unable
to tear himself away from the society
of his former comrades in arms, and
It was for acting in a disorderly man
ner while he was intoxicated on the
outskirts of the reservation that he
was arrested. He was remanded for
a week and advised to devote the In
terim to sobering up.
Mrs. Louise Hoffman's eyes, nose
and temple were bruised and discol
ored when she appeared before Judge
Mogan as prosecutrix of her husband,
Louis, a clamdigger, whose family
residence is at Thirty-second avenue
and C street south. The woman said
her facial injuries were inflicted by
her spouse's fist and he pleaded provo
cation, alleging that she diverted to
other uses $10 which he gave her with
instruction that it be expended in pay
ment of certain pressing bills. He
allowed her to spend 20 cents per
diem for "booze," he added, which
was two-thirds the sum he allotted to
himself for the purchase of alcoholic
stimulants, and he thought she ought
to be content with that instead of
"nipping" funds intended for the buy
ing of victuals for the household, in
cluding three children, all of whom
were unproductive of revenue. That's
why he "licked" her.
Despite the woman's tearful appeal
for leniency the court pronounced the
brutal disciplinarian guilty of battery
and ordered him to appear for sen
tence to-day.
Thomas Sweeney had a total of
eighteen eggs in various pockets of his
raiment when Patrolman E. N. Owens
arrested him for pilfering the same
from the grocery of John H. Dickman,
1300 Railroad avenue South, at 6:40
o'clock yesterday morning. Strange to
relate not one of the eggs w^s
smashed during the arrest, which was
not affected without some resistance,
and the absence of breakage inclined
the policeman to believe that his pris
oner was an adept in the art of lifting
and stowing fragile plunder.
Mr. Dickman had been the victim
of petty purloinings for some time ere
he- tnd Patrolman Owens put their
heads together and devised a plan that
might lead to the thief's detection.
With a lead pencil they wrote diminu
tive letters of the alphabet on the egg.*-
forming the top layer in an open box
that stood in the store, and then they
laid in wait. Almost the first per
son to enter the store yesterday was
Mr. Sweeney, and he was given a clear
field for larceny by Mr. Dickman, who
for that purpose retired to a rear
apartment, buj the eagle eye of the
policeman was riveted on the visitor.
When the eighteenth egg, marked "R""
and* bo entered as an exhibit, waft
transferred from the box to the hip
po< ket of Mr. Sweeney's pantaloons,
the arrest was made. For obvious rea
son the policeman's search of his
prisoner was not conducted with any
rudeness usually exercised in that pro
cess. The most intrepid law guardian
would hesitate to plunge his hand into
a pocketful of scrambled eggs.
In the court of Judge Mogan the
defendant acknowledged that the
eighteen eggs were found on his per
son, but he denied having stolen them
and declared they had been given to
him by his mother-in-law. The al
phabetical marks would not down,
however, and finally Mr. Sweeney
pleaded guilty as charged. He will be
sentenced for petty larceny.
Frank J. Harris, accused of steal
ing a typewriting machine from the
headquarters of the Building Trades
Council, 927 Market street, was sent
by Judge Cabaniss to answer a grand
larceny charge in the Superior Court.
From the North End Music Hall to
the court of Judge Mogan was con
veyed the information that Miss Eva
Dimples, soprano serio-comic, ac
cused of having waylaid and Mattered
Miss Alice Wainwright, clog and soft
shoe danseuse, was suffering from
nervous prostration and unable to ap
pear either in the tribunal or upon
the stage. As the understudy who
took Miss Dimples' place on the North
End programme could not reasonably
be expected to act as her substitute on
the court calendar also the case was
continued until March 1.
Mrs. Bella Pettigrew's charge of
battery against her husband. Andrew
J., a marine fireman, was dismissed
by the same magistrate after Patrol
man Heinrichs testified that to him
she confessed marital infidelity. The
Pettigrews keep a lodging-house at 13
Hawthorne street and the husband,
suspicious of the wife's fealty to him,
waited and watched until he was con
vinced of her guilt. When he burst
in one door of her apartment at 4:30
o'clock yesterday morning one James
O'Brien, a lodger in the house, fled
through another exit. It was for tap
ping her head with the heel of a shoe
which belonged to neither him nor
her that Mrs. Pettigrew had Mr. Pet
tigrew arrested.

NO MORE HOPE
FOR DIMMICK
Circuit Court of Appeals
Says Testimony Shows
Him to Be Clearly Guilty
PIEKCE GETS $15,000
Wong Din Must Serve Out
His Sentence of Imprison
ment in Conspiracy Case
Walter N. Dimmick's last appeal
from the judgment of the United
States District Court convicting him
of the theft of $30,000 from the
United States Mint was dismissed yes
terday by the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals. In passing upon
the case the appeal court said:
There is ample testimony given at the trial
tending to show that the money of the Gov
ernment was stolen from tho Mint and that
Dlmmick was the person who committed the
theft.
With reference to the point raised
as to the credibility of the witnesses
for the Government the court said:
The rule is well settled that the credibility
of the witnesses and the i>robatlve force of
facts Introduced in evidence are the sole
province of the jury. â¢ â¢ â¢ The Appellate
Lourt cannot weigh the evidence. The only
question before the court is whether there is
any legal evidence to sustain the verdict.
Dimmick is serving an eight years*
sentence at San Quentin.
The court also sustained the verÂ»
diet of the jury In tne United States
Circuit Court awarding $15,000 dam
ages to Samuel C. Pierce for bodily
injures received while working under
ground in the mine of the Mountain
Copper Company, Limited. The appeal
court used this language:
The law, in our 'opinion, made it the duty of
the plaintiff in error to Inform the defendant
of the collar and set Pcrews, and how to per
form the dangerous task before sending or
permitting him in the course of his employ
ment to undertake it. â¢ â¢ â¢ He was not fa
miliar with machinery. â¢ â¢ â¢ True it is
that Tierce knew It was dangerous to approach
a shaft belt or other machinery In motion,
nevertheless it is the duty of the master, be
fore sending or permittinc an inexperienced
employe to perform such dangerous work, to
instruct him how to ptrform it and especially
to inform him of any hidden, concealed or ob
scure danger.
Judgment of the lower court was
affirmed in the cases of William Baei>
Ewing, convicted of using the post
office to further a scheme to defraud,
and Wong Din, convicted with Dasha

Chinese illegally.

SYMMES FAVORS
VOTERS' LEAGUE
Would Expose All the Bad
in Lives of Candidates
Seeking a Public Office
CHICAGO AX EXAMPLE
Speaker Urges Churches to
Take Active Part in Work
of Making Politics Purer
"Civic Duty" was the subject pre
sented yesterday by Frank J. Symmes,
president of the Merchants' Associa
tion, before the Methodist Ministers'
Association at Epworth Hall. The
Rev. F. A. Keast presided and the hall
was crowded.
Symmes urged that all good citi
zens must go to the polls and vote tot
the best men. In this connection he
pointed out that the worst elements of
the city never neglect to cast their
votes, and while doing so they voted
not alone for themselves, but cast
votes for others.
He described the corruption at the \
lam August primary election and gave
Fairfax Wheelan and the Merchants' ;
Association praise for the part they <
had played in detecting and exposing
fraudulent voting. Then he told of the
good joke the Election Commission '
thought it was playing when it called
upon representative men, men of af
fairs, to do service at the booths. The I
result of their presence was obvious.
At the general election the very fact
that such men were at the booths had '
its influence and the frauds and con
ditions practiced at the primary elec
tton were not repeated.
The matter of selecting proper men
for civic positions was one which need
ed the prompt attention of the people
and as a safeguard against the nom
ination of men unworthy to represent '
the citizens of this community Symmes
urged the adoption in San Francisco
of "The Voters' League," which, he I
said, had proved of infinite value in
Chicago in that it had purged the
municipal government of numerous
men unworthy a position of trust.
He told of the complete exposures '
made by the league. It gave candi
dates for office full credit for honesty :
or otherwise.
EXPOSES SHADY ACTS.
It revealed In its printed pamphlet
whatever shady or rascally act was
associated with any candidate for of
fice, telling the voter plainly that such
a man was unfit to receive support. If
a man was a thief he was called a
thief, if a boodler he was so designated
in plain English.
There had been an attempt on the
part of candidates thus exposed to
charge the league with libel, but with
out success. Symmes expressed his
confidence that such a league in San
Francisco would be of advantage, for
then voters would have the character
of the aspirants for office before them.
He was of opinion that there was room
here for more organizations in the in
terest of good government besides the
Merchants' Association, and in advo
cating this he gave credit to the vari
ous clubs which were formed for just
such a purpose.
Symmes then told of the safety stai
tions and other public conveniences
which had been erected by the Mer
chants' Association, just to show the
city what the city could do. There
were those in the administration who
did not approve of the Merchants' As
sociation. It had imposed upon itself
the duty to prevent frauds at elections
while other matters of interest to city
government were under consideration.
The association supported civil service
principles; it had an attorney at Sac
ramento in the interests of good gov
ernment; the liquor question was re
ceiving its consideration, and if the
Liquor Dealers' Association could in
fluence candidates with the promise
that it controls 10,000 then surely a
citizens' organization could come out,
he thought, and pledge candidates
that it could commit 15.000 voters to
the best interests of the people. He
believed that a man preferred the sup
port of the better element. The
churches, he considered, ought to or
ganize societies and take care of the
next election. Symmes warned his
hearers that they "must get busy by
the next three months."
ADVISES BRETHREN.
In the discussion which followed
the Rev. A. C. Bane called upon his
hearers to rally to the support of the
Merchants' Association and help in
the cause of good government.
The Christian church convention
committee. Dr. W. M. White chair
man, received a notification from the
East last night announcing the ac
ceptance of the railroad rate from St.
Louis and Chicago to San Francisco,
which is one first-class fare for the
round trip. It was also said that
there is a strong desire on the part of
delegates and their friends to visit
San Francisco next August, and while
there will not be quite so large a gath
ering here as would have been the
case had the rate been the same as re
quested, still the convention commit
tee may expect and arrange for a
large attendance.
The Union Evangelical Committee
met in the Y. M. C. A. auditorium
yesterday afternoon, Bishop John
Hamilton, D. D., LL.D., in the chair,
to consider a great evangelical revival
in San Francisco, conducted by Dr.
Wilbur Chapman and his staff. It
was resolved that the general com
mittee, composed of every clergyman
and one layman of the various de
nominations, agree to the movement
and that the general committee ap
point an executive committee of one
from each denomination represented.
Dr. Chapman will be here Tuesday,
March 7.

Mr. and Mrs. Kilbcy Receive a Royal
Reception at Lyric Hall From

Commander Kilbey of the Salva
tion Army and Mrs. Kilbey were
royally welcomed last night at Lyric

members of the army and its friends,

Mr. and Mrs. Kilbey arrived from

Colonel French made a few remark*
and then introduced the new com.
manders to the audience. When Mr.

heartily cheered. He spoke at length
of the good work this body had done
for the Door and downfallen and re
cited many instances of reformation*
brought about by the army. He said
that, in the future the Salvation Army
intended to 'do more "prison gate
work" among those who had erred.

GRAND JURY
AFTER LEVY
Objects to His Methods of
Caring for "Corporation
Yard" Cartage Receipts
TEEASUKEE IS IGNORED
Inquisitors Insist Munici
pal Funds Shall All Go
Through Usual Channel
The business methods of the "cor
poration yard," which is under the
control of the Department of Public
Works, are being inquired into by the
Grand Jury, and the matter will prob
ably receive attention at its session
this afternoon.
A considerable amount of property
found obstructing public thorough
fares is gathered up every month by
the department and stored at the cor
poration yard until the owner redeems
it. He is compelled to pay the cost
of cartage. In these transactions thÂ»
moneys do not pass through the city
treasury. The grand jurors declare
that municipal employes should not
handle any funds except through the
usual medium of the City and County
Auditor and the Treasurer.
Expert Young also discovered that
Morris Levy, secretary to the Public
Works Commission, has had $100 in
his possession for a year that was col
lected at the corporation yard, but
was never turned into the treasury.
It appears that property which a p<K
liceman had ordered off the street re
mained at the yard for a long time
without a claim for it by its owner. A
purchaser was found who put up a de*
posit of $100. He regretted his bar
gain, however, and the deposit was
forfeited. But to whom it was forv
feited no one seems to know. It is
explained that there is no provision
for turning such money into the city's
treasury and that Levy has simply
kept it because he did not know what
to do with it.
The Grand Jury has ideas of its
own in the matter, however, and is
giving the case a thorough investiga
tion. Secretary Levy also has on hand
$49. surplus of collections for cartage
of the dry goods boxes, scrap iron and
the like that were summarily hauled
off the street. Those who redeem the^
property are mulcted in a slight
amount for the purpose of raising a
fund with which to pay for hauling
the loads that are not redeemed.
The Grand Jury is working on the ;
theory that the secretary has no right j
to arrogate to himself the authority ;
to handle funds on his own responsi- i
bility that are received in the coarse j
of municipal business.
Public Works Commissioners Mae
stretti, Eagan and Aigeltinger were
before a committee of grand jurorst
yesterday. District Attorney Bying
ton. who was present, insisted that
the plan of having city funds handled
by a secretary and not through the
Auditor and the Treasurer was highly
improper and pointed out that tho
Bond and Warrant Clerk in his office
must turn bail moneys over to the
Treasurer, although they may be re
paid within <i few hours.
BXAI B'RITH GRAND LODGE
TO HEXP JEWISH AI/LJAXCE
The Golden Anniversary of the Order
to Be Observed by a Two Days'
Celebration.
At yesterday's session of the district
Grand Lodge No. 4 of the Independent
Order of B'nai B'rith many matters
relative to minor amendments to the
laws were presented and discussed,
and it was decided to have an even
ing session for the purpose of act
ing upon them.
The grand body adopted the report
of the special committee to the effect
that the fiftieth anniversary of the
founding of the order in this jurisdic
tion shall be held in this city August
14 and 15. There will be a pro
gramme of exercises commemorative
of the event, a grand ball and a aup
per.
The Grand Lodge has decided to as
sist the Jewish Alliance, which has for
its purpose the assistance of Jewish
immigrants. A special committee will
be appointed to take charge of the
matter and one member of the order
will be added to the committee from
each place in the jurisdiction in which
there is a lodge of the order. It will
be a part of the duties of the com
mittee to find employment for those
new arrivals in need of it.
The report of the committee on the
state of the order was adopted as pre
sented.
An amendment to the general laws
was adopted. It is to the effect that
applicants for membership in lodges
that do not have benefits shall not be
required to undergo a medical exam
ination.
At the election to be held to-day
there will be sixteen candidates for
the eight positions of representatives
to the constitutional Grand Lodge that
is to meet in New Orleans this year.
TO URGE VACCINATIONâ AIthough this
city has been exempt from a smallpox epi- ,
demic for more than five yean, there have '
been numerous cases of the dread contagion
in this city, necessitating the keeping open of
the Smallpox Hospital. In almost every caae i
the person afflicted has never been vaccinated. '
There ia nov.- a bill before the Legislature
to repeal the present law that makes vacdna- !
tlon compulsory- Alfred Russell Wallace '
Herbert Spencer and many great scientists op- I
pose vaccination, it Is said. A committee from
the Board of Health will probably visit Sac
ramento and use its endeavors to have the bill
defeated.
