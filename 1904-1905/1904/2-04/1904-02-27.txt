JAPANESE FLEET CONTINUES THE BOMBARDMENT OF PORT ARTHUR DAILY
TO COVER DISEMBARKING OF TROOPS THAT WILL ATTACK STRONGHOLD BY LAND
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 26. -A dispatch from Port Arthur, dated February 26, says: "At 1 o'clock this morning several
Japanese torpedo boats were sighted from here, with sails set for the purpose of disguising their character. The battleship
Ret vizan and the shore batteries opened fire on them and continued firing until daybreak without any visible result. After daybreak
a Japanese squadron, apparently convoying troops, was sj^S^;|^t|Sf(ii(i|^]|^al| 11 o'clock the squadron came nearer and an
engagement which lasted forty minutes ensued. There was no damage. Few shells fell in Port Arthur. It is expected here that the
Japanese will attempt a landing soon. An inspection of tiie\ : JipWM;#eghips- sent into the harbor on February 24 shows they were
loaded with coal and kerosene and that electrical infernal machines i had^been placed in the midst of the cargo."

Special Dispatch to The C*!i
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 26.â More than
10,000 acres of the most valuable land in
Sacramento County is flooded to-night
as the result of a break in the levee,
which occurred at the Edwards place,
about three miles south of this city.
The break is the most serious experi
enced in this county in twenty-seven
years and threatens injury to thou
sands of Â«.cres of the most valuable hop
and fruit land in the State. In fact, the
Y-street levee is the only barrier that
prevents the water from coming into
the city itself.
The water rushed through the break
in a perfect torrent, uprooting great
oak trees and freeing houses from their
foundations. Several exciting escapes
were experienced by families in the
vicinity, and many -head of stock per
ished. -
The break was about seventy feet
wide at first, but it widened toÂ»such an
extent that to-night it reached 200 feet
in width, and the water is pouring
through the crevasse in immense vol
umes. The land inundated as a result
of the flood is in the richest hop-grow
ing and fruit section of the State. It
was thought that the levee system
which protected it was impervious to
the water.
The reports received from the Ameri
can River district and other tributaries
show that the water is coursing down
from the mountains in unexampled vol
umes, and more trouble is looked for
to-morrow, lien are patrolling the
levee on both sides of the river. A weak
spot was discovered in the levee on the
Tolo side nearly opposite Sacramento
this morning, but a. force of men was
â was put at work to strengthen the bar
rier with sand bags. The water in the
Yolo basin is rushing beneath the tres
tles of the Southern Pacific Company a
few miles west of Washington. Watch
men are stationed at intervals to report
any injury done to the track by high
â¢water. The Oroville branch is still five
feet under water, and it will be several
days before traffic on that line can be
resumed. A number of Marysville citi
izens on their way home from San
Francisco are stalled here because of
the high water, which prevents them
'from continuing on their way home.

a state of anxiety to-night as to wheth
er or not the next twenty-four hours

and flooding adjacent property. Thus
far the high water has been passing to
the north of the city, by the Mokel
umne. When the sky cleared at noon
to-day it was thought the storm had
passed, but such was not the case, for
rain set in again about 5 o'clock this
evening, and all indications are for a
very wet night. The Mokelumne River
began falling early this morning, and
by 2 o'clock this afternoon it had

BERLIN, Feb. 26.â My- message of
last night regarding the preparations
made in Austria with a view to inter
vention in the Balkans finds confirma
tion to-day in the Berlin Morgen Post.
This Journal contains a dispatch from
its Vienna correspondent stating that,
according to information obtained from
an official of the Austrian Foreign Of
fice, measures have been taken for the
mobilization of the Austrian army.
The present rise in the price of grain
in Austria may be ascribed to pur
chases by the military authorities.
These reports of Austrian military
preparations" find further confirmation
in dispatches received in Berlin from
Rome stating that the Italian Embas
sador in Berlin, Count Lanza, has in
formed Count von Bulow that if Aus
tria takes action in the Balkans it will
be difficult for Italy to abstain from
active intervention.

understood that Turkey, undertakes to
grant amnesty to the Macedonians con
victed of disturbances in 1900, to permit

Kuropatkin Wants 400,000
Troops to Precede Him
to the Front.
Special Cablegram to The Call and New York Herald. Copyright, 1904/ by
the New York Herald Publishing Company. . . -â .-.,.;
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 26. â Sur
prising and almost astounding, the
latest news is that General Kuropatkin
will not go to the front, as was pre
viously announced, in three days' time,
but will remain here for several weeks.
The reason for this, he states, is that
it is not worth while for him to go
there until 400,000 Russian soldiers
are gathered at the seat of war. In fact,
he cannot take the offensive until that
number is forthcoming. The present
force available, outside of the heavy
contingent guarding the railroad, does
not exceed 130,000 men.
General Kuropatkin was recently in
Japan, where he formed a very high
opinion of the efficiency of the Jap
anese troops. . He belonged to the
anti-war party. At a recent audience
with the Emperor, General Kuropat
kin spoke very openly about the neces
sity of his having a large number'of
troops and he is further credited with
having said: ;.
7 "Your Majesty will need me back
soon to look after European develop
ments." . , .
Very probably the key. is given to
this in the statement of a widely
known Russian international jurist,
who says it is quite possible that Rus
sia will wage â¢ war concerning the
Tibetan question in case â  England
should make, any move of too friendly
a nature toward . Japan.

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 27, 2 a. m.â
A copy of a, telegram from Viceroy
jstt'xyt to the Czar has just been given
out. It is dated February 25. The place
whence , it is sent 1 ! is not given, but it
is supposed to be Mukden. The mes
sage follows:
. "A : squadron of the enemy's vessels,
numbering sixteen,"^ approached the
fortress at about 11, o'clock this morn
ing and opened a bombardment on the
cruisers Askold, Bayan \ and Novik,
.which? were in the outer harbor, and
also on , the fortress. The firing , con
tinued for a half hour. Then our cruis
efsT. went into the harbor. The enemy
fired , for. several minutes on. one of
our batteries, and then began to leave.
They, stopped within sight of the fort,
but. out. of range of the fire.' -
- "At this time, four of the enemy's
cruisers detached themselves from the
"squadron and proceeded to Pigeon Bay, v
where they quickly opened fire on our
torpedo-boats that .were cruising there.
They^ directed also a strong cannonade
against the shore.,' The commandant
consequently sent troops to Pigeon Bay.
The firing lasted for thirty minutes,
but ' no"; landing was â ; made. The Jap
anese cruisers, then departed.\
1 "Suitable measures j have deen taken
to oppose a possible move, on : the part
of the enemy to creep' up'Dy sea. 'Our

PRESS STORY OF BATTLE.
A press dispatch from Port Arthur
says the Japanese torpedo-boat attack
on February 25 resulted in a Russian
success. The accurate shooting of the
batteries inflicted losses on the enemy
and caused the boiler on one of the
Japanese torpedo-boats to explode.
Early in the morning a Japanese
fleet consisting of six battleships and
four cruisers appeared on the horizon.
The Russian cruisers * Askold, Bayan
and ' Novlk were then In the harbor
and the Japanese torpedo boats ad
vanced to thirty to thirty-five
cable lengths to attack them. . The
Japanese battleships and cruisers sep
arated and then advanced against two
Russian torpedo boats cruising In
Pigeon Bay. One of the latter broke
through the enemy's line and under a
hot fire reached the harbor.
At 10:45 o'clock a fierce engage
ment took place between the Japanese
battleships and the Russian ; cruisers,
supported by the shore batteries. In
view of the superiority of the enemy's
six battleships over the three Russian
cruisers, the latter were withdrawn.
â The enemy : ceased ; firing at 11:33
o'clock and at 12 o'clock the Japanese
cruisers which were chasing the Rus
sian torpedo boats began. to fire on the
forts, but, the firing did not last long.
v T,he Japanese .maneuvering was
clumsy, and { in turning their vessels
came, so, close ..to one another that
Russian shells could be seen falling
upon them as. they huddled together.

driven : ashore near,; Fort DJetwol Is
supposed to have belonged to the flo
tilla which was escorting the five ships
destroyed on the night.of February 23.

Verdict Is Secured After

Nine Hours.

Pending Their Appearance in
Court To-Day for Sentence,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â "Guilty as
indicted" was the verdict announced
by the Jury in th4 postofflce conspiracy
trial shortly after 8 o'clock to-night,
stating at the same time that this was
the verdict as to all four defendants.
August W. Machen, late general super
intendent of the rural free delivery di
vision; George E. Lorenz of Toledo,
Samuel A. Groff and Diller B. Groff, of
Washington. The Jury had been out
nine hours.
In the dimly lighted room sat the
four .defendants, who after the case
was given to the Jury had been placed
in the custody of a United States Mar
shal and confined to the limits of the
City Hall. Each wore an anxious look
and a deathlike silence fell on the
small crowd which had been permitted
to enter the room as the clerk inquired
of the foreman if a verdict had been
reached. :/;
The jury as to a man' arose, and as
the words "Guilty as ' indicted" fell
from the foreman's lips the defendants
and their counsel seemed appalled. Dur
ing the time the Jury was out the four
defendants had paced up and down
the hallway outside the courtroom and
had given expressions to the belief that
each hour the Jury spent in discussing
the case brought them nearer to ac
quittal.
There was general astonishment that
the Jury had included in the conviction
Samuel A. Groff, a Washington police
man, and inventor of the Groff fastener,
as to whom Holmes Conrad, special
counsel for the Government, yesterday
informed the Jury he did not expect a
conviction and that he personally did
not believe in his guilt.
Five ballots in all were taken. On
the first ballot the vote stood seven to
five for conviction; on the secocJ.
eight to four; on the third, nine to
three; on the fourth, ten to two, and on
the fifth the vote was unanimous.
Immediately after the verdict was
rendered Charles Douglass, in behalf
of all four defendants, filed motions for
a new trial, for an arrest of Judgment
and for an appeal for the purpose of
having the defendants admitted to bail.
Bail was then fixed at $20,000 each, the
bond of Lorer.z and the two Groff s be
ing increased from $10,000.
" When " Attorney Maddox, on behalf
of the Groffs. inquired as to the amount
of bail to be required of them. Justice
Pritchard said: "I know no difference
between these defendants. The jury
has said they are guilty and I cannot
discriminate, but will treat all alike."
Next to Samuel A. Groff, the most
surprised man was Machen, who said
he was thunderstruck at the verdict.
The four defendants will appear be
fore Justice Pritchard to-morow
morning to receive sentence.

JAPANESE WILL ATTEMPT CAPTURE OF VLADIVOSTOK
Stern View as to Neutrality
Is Taken by the State
Department .
Si>ecial Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON', Feb. 26. â The United
States Stute Department has taken a.
ptern view of the duties and obliga
tions of a neutral nation in time of
war. The action of Commander Mar
shall of the cruiser Vicksburg in re
fusing to join the other naval officers
at Chemulpo in protesting against the
J:iji.*nepe plan to attack the Russian
warships Variag and Koreitz in the
neutral harbor is unqualifiedly sus
tained. As to the Russian accusation
that the Vk-ksburg refused to rescue
drowning Russian seamen after the
finking cf the Variag â an incident
vhich has greatly incensed the Rus
fian populace against Americans, but
which has not yet been confirmed â it
is held that even though the charge
be true the American officer did right,
as the Russian crews had not surren
dered and their rescue from drowning
would have oeen a breach of neu
trality. This view is directly antagon
istic to that he!d by Great Britain and
other powers represented at Chemul
po, the British and French warships
not only picking up the Russian sea
men, but showing them every cour
tesy and ultimately arranging for their
parole.
GOULD 11AV1-: REACHED SHORE.
It is believed here, however, that it
was not a matter of saving life. It is
believed thut the Russians could have
landed on shore and refrained from
doinfT so only because they feared to
be captured by the Japanese soldiers
of the town. Had Commander Mar
shall received them aboard the Vicks
burg he must have taken them in as
prisoners, for that was the status ac
corded them by the French and the
British naval forces present. There
fore, as the Ru.-sian sailors would have
been practically Japanese prisoners,
in either cuse, whether they landed or
whether they boarded the Vicksburg,
the American captain is regarded as
justified in having declined to receive
them.
The following bulletin was posted at
the Navy Department this afternoon:
"A dispatch from Commander Mar
s-hall, commanding the United States
ship Vicksburg, states that he sent
medical aid as well as boats to the as
sistance of the Variag."
The cablegram is badly garbled, and
the officials have not been able to fully
translate it.
PROI"OSi:i> CAULK TO JAPAX
At \\x? Cabinet meeting to-day the
question of the landing of the Japanese
cable on the island of Guam was con
sidered. A proposition has been made
by the Government to the cable com
pany, on behalf of Japr.i, to land a
cable on the island of Guam in order
to connect Japan with the American
cable at this point. Japan has two
cable lines connecting it with the out
side world. Both of them run from
Nagasaki across the lower end of the
Yellow Sea to Shanghai. If these
cables should be cut by the Russians,
Japan would be cut off from communi
cation by cable with other countries.
This question of granting permission
to the cable company to land its cable
at Guam involves, to some extent, the
neutrality of the United States in the
pending Far Eastern conflict. Practi
cally, it is understood, a decision has
beÂ«n reached that such permission
cou'.d be granted without violating the
term? of neutrality laid down by the
United States in its proclamation. It
peems not unlikely, however, that some
condition}! may be attached to the per
mission, if it Fhouid be granted. The
question now is in the hands of Secre
tary Hay, and a determination of it
probably will be reached very soon.
ASSAII-S UNITED STATES.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 26. â The
Novoe Vremya this morning published
a long leading article regarding the re
lations existing between the United
States and Russia. In considering the
unfriendly manifestations against the
latter in the United States, the Novoe
Vremya argues distinction must be
made between the people and the Gov
ernment, and it attributes the agita
tion in the press to a campaign engi
neered by the Jews, who, it has been
said, even talk of building a battleship
for the Mikado. The paper insists,
however, that the traditional friend
ship for Russia occupies a firm position
in the American mind and heart and
that the people cannot really prefer the
Japanese to the Russians, who never
have harmed them.
The Novoe Vremya, on the . other
hand, contends that without reason the
Washington Government has been un
friendly to Russia, and compares the
most brilliant feat of the State De
partmentâthe telegraphic ratification
of the Chinese open port treatyâ to tele
graphic marriages which. It says, some
times are practiced in America.
But it is idle, the article goes on. to
talk now of sending United States Con
suls to Manchuria. Unsatisfied with
his Euccess, Secretary of . State Hay
undertook to secure the neutralization,
the inviolability of administration and
the entity of China. Diplomatists, lexi
cographers and publicists ' beinÂ» In
doubt as to what all this meant, Sec
retary Hay kindly announced that he
did not care to have his proposal de
fined in detail. The article concludes:
THAT CHE.MULTO INCIDENT.
"The American Government has tak
en a position which . Ill -; accords with
the former good relations with Russia,
and we are convinced that the con
duct <rt the United States gunboat
Vicksburg in refusing to protect and
receive drowning Russians will not
meet with wide cympat' . in America,
nor will the Americans sympathize with
ihe naval demonstration at the mouth
of- the Yalu River, of ivhich the tele
graph brought a report yesterday."
As cabled from London on February
22, the Nagasaki correspor-*.ent of the
Lcndon Daily Telegraph asserted that
"the American squadron, the vessels
of 'which are variously reported at
Chefu and Shanghai, is 'going to'make
a demonstration at the mouth" of the
tr.u. ziixor." It Is oossible that this
is the report to which, the 'Novoe

pay for the support of 1500 of such
hardened .warriors throughout the' war
if the Emperor accept his proposition.
..What one "hears more often. , dis
cussed than any, other question " just
now is : the: probability of trouble be
tween this country and! the United
States. America to-day Is' looked upon
here as a direct and most : formidable
enemy of Russia and Russia's ire is
intense thereat.
Intense activity, is shown in Danish
military preparations, increasing the
strength of the forts and raising new
ones on the island of Saltholm. Den
mark is keeping three military trains
under steam for the purpose of rap
idly focusing her strength. This at
tracts much attention here and Is
reckoned as a preliminary step to
closing the Baltic. The Novoe
Vremya calls attention to the fact
that British arsenals" are working
night and day with feverish haste.
AS IN DAYS OF KNIGHTHOOD.
Like a knight of olden times before
going to battle, General Kuropatkin
to-day performed the most solemn rites
of the mother church. After fasting
this week he went to the church in the
Cadet Corps Academy, where he was
educated, and there made his confes
sion and partook of the sacrament. The
officiating priest, holding up the sacred
image of St. Sergius, which has just ar
rived in Moscow, blessed the. prostrate
commander and bade him godspeed.
The general was shaking with emotion
and embraced many of his assembled
comrades.
The Metropolitan of Moscow, who ac
companied the Ikon of St. Sergius to
St. Petersburg, has received letters
from the Czar recalling the overthrow
of the. Tartar hordes under its auspices
and prophesying that it also will lead
the Russians to victory over the Jap
anese.
Like ' millions of their subjects; the
Czar and Czarina to-day made confes
sions of their sins. It was a day of
praise as well as of prayer here, and
the solemn rites attending the cere
mony of confession alternated with
thanksgiving for the news from the
East. Their Majesties confessed in the
church of the winter palace to Court
Chaplain Yanisheff and afterward
walked in the palace garden.
VISIT THE IMPERIAL TOMBS.
The visit of the Czar and Czarina to
the imperial tombs in the Cathedral of
St. Peter and St. Paul and the fortress
of St. Peter and St. Paul occurred this
morning. They prayed for a long time
"beside the tombs of the Czar's father
and brother, and a cheering multitude
greeted them as they drove to* the
Chapel of . the Saviour In Peter the
Great's house, â¢'" which is a short dis
tance from the fortress. There they
attended a special service of prayer. Â«
At kroristadt to-night a general con
fession was. given by Father John of
Kronstadt in St. Andrew's Church.
Since the beginning of Lent pilgrims
have been arriving at Kronstadt from
throughout European Russia and the
lodging-houses are full. â¢ The church
was thronged with worshipers -and
there . was an Immense crowd outside.
With the opening of the service the
congregation began to wall and their
cries, groans and shouts produced a
w-eird effect. The tumult ceased sud
denly when Father John arose and pro
nounced forgiveness of. the sins of all
present.

Japanese Report of
Attack on Port
Arthur.
TOKLO/Feb. 27; â The official report
of the i .'attempt made' last Tuesday
night to :block the entrance of the har
bor of Port Arthur reached Toklo last
night^(Friday). The report was' writ
ten' by;Vice- Admiral Kamimura; divi
sib'n commander" under jAdmiralTogo.
The. reix>rt v refcites tha^t .at a 'certain
point! near. Port Arthur Tuesday even
ing a number .of- merchant steamers,
escorted by a .torpedo' flotilla, were'dis
patehed for the purpose of closing the
entrance; to the harbor. The torpedo
.liotilla j rejoined > the fie'et at 10 a. m.
at sea at a rendezvous.pre
viously agreed upon and reported that
the steamer Hokoku Maru had been
sunk at the foot of the lighthouse on
the left side of the entrance.
The Bushi Maru was sunk outside,
beyond the Hokoku Maru. The Tenshin
Maru, the Buoy Maru and Jinsen Maru
were sunk at the foot of Latotche Hill
almost side by side. All the
mentioned steamers were sunk by their
own crews, who were all safely rescued.
The torpedo flotilla was unharmed. The
torpedo Hot ilia also reported that it dis
covered the Russian cruisers Bayan and
No-vik together with a few destroyers
in the outer harbor.
After the ..flotilla., rejoined it the
main* fleet J advanced 'slowly on Port
Arthur, ' where it found the Russian
cruisers Bayan, Askold ' and Novik
moving about the f c ouÂ£er harbor and
under cover of the batteries. A bom
bardment began at long range and at
11:45 a. m. all the ships and batteries
were responding vigorously. Shortly
after noon tfie Novik retreated into
the inner harbor. The Askold and
Bayan, quickly following, demonstrat
ed that the sinking of the steamers
had not blocked the entrance of the
harbor. A bombardment of the in
ner harbor was then ordered and for
fifteen minutes all of the heavy guns
of the Japanese fleet threw shells over
the hills into the harbor.
The Japanese were unable to deter
mine' the effect of the bombardment,
but saw huge columns of smoke aris
ing from time to time. In the .mean
time the Japanese cruiser squadron dis
covered two Russian torpedo-boat de
stroyers at" the foot of Laotche Hill and
gave chase. One of the destroyers es
caped, but the other was pursued into
Pigeon Bay where it was sunk. , Vice
Admiral Kamimura reports that the
Japanese fleet sustained no damage
and did riot lose a single man.

''The enemy's squadron of sixteen
warships approached from the Dalny
side toward the. harbor of Port Arthur
at about 11 o'clock this morning and
at once opened fire on our'three cruis
ers standing outside the roadstead,
namely, the Askold, the Bayan and
the Novik, and also against the land
forts. : The bombardment lasted* a
Half hour.' At its conclusion our
cruisers retired into the harbor. The
enemy then bombarded one land bat

enemy also retreated, remaining out
of range of our guns.
| "In the meanwhile four Japanese
cruisers separated from the enemy's
main squadron and went into Golu

fire on one of our torpedo boats sta

batteries. Consequently the commander
of the fort sent troops to this point,
but no landing took place. The bom

minutes, at the expiration of which the

on our side this day was 'one man

Special Cablegram to The Call and New York Herald. Copyright. 1904. bj
the New -York Herald Publishing Company.
LONDON, Feb. 27. â So much im
portance is attached to the report in
the Russian Herald that the Jap
anese had made a landing at Possiet
Bay that -the London newspapers of
this morning print detailed maps of
the district to illustrate the suggested
movement.
It is, of course, recognized that the
report may be incorrect. As cabled
by the Chefu correspondent of The
Call,- it was given as a rumor, and the
authority cited by the Newchwang cor
respondent of the Daily Mail was a
missionary,, whose testimony might be
of the hearsay order, while a Reuter
dispatch which came later quoted na
tive testimony.
: Still it is- believed by military and
naval experts in. London that there are
a good many chances of the reported
Japanese landing at Possiet Bay being
ah accomplished fact^and one who is
usually a good judge went so far as to
predict that ere long a simultaneous
attack would be made on Vladivostok
and Port Arthur. That, he said, would
be a coup de theatre quite in line with
the declaration made on Thursday by
Japan's- Premier, Count Katsura, that
Japan was resolved to strike hard and
strike fast, if only that the agony
might be as brief as possible.
There has been, according to this
viewi a lifting in two places of the
veil which shrouds Japan's prepara
tions for land operations. One was the
Possiet Bay. report and the other Is
contained in a dispatch from Bennett
Burleigh respecting the landing of
troops in the vicinity of Dalny. Bur
leigh had been at Nagasaki for several
weeks, but, tiring of enforced inaction
there, left Japan recently and yester
day turned up at Shanghai, whence he
eent the Important news in question.
Berlin advices state that German
tacticians discredit the report of a
Japanese landing at Possiet Bay,
which, they say, is strongly defended,
and they utterly reject the statement
that the Russian garrison retired with
out having fired a shot.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph asserts that the Rus
sians are evacuating Dalny. The Rus
sians boast that they have mined the
breakwater, .wharves and railroad sid
ings at Dalny in order to prevent the
Japanese making use of these facilities.
This correspondent repeats that the
Russians have supplies for only five
months at Port Arthur.
RUSSIAN* EXPERT OPINION*.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 25.-Â«-There
is a difference of opinion among the
military and naval officers in regard
to the: purpose of the Japanese move
ments at Port Arthur, but the,pre
vailing opinion is that it is to effect
a diversion to cover their movement
elsewhere. A high naval officer, speak
ing of the attempt to block the chan
nel, said:
"I cannot understand what the Japa
nese hoped to accomplish. They forget
that the days of wooden, inflammable
ships are past. If their object really
was to block the channel it was equally
futile, as it would be easy to clear the
entrance by blowing up the wreck. We
believe the Japanese activity at Port
Arthur was a feint to engross our at
tention while they continue their dis
embarkation of troops in Korea. I do
not believe that at this time they will
attempt a landing in force on the Llao
tung peninsula." i
It is said that the battleship Retvl
zan, outside the mouth of the harbor, is
acting as a guardship. The remainder
of the Russian squadron is inside to
avoid a torpedo attack.
The Idea that the Japanese seriously
contemplate a bombardment of Port
Arthur, inviting the exposing of their
ships to a plunging fire from the guns
on Golden Hill, is regarded by military
experts as absurd.
JAPAN IS SENDING

SHANGHAI, Feb. 26. â A large
number of ''transports have returned
to Nagasaki, where they are busily

for the vicinity of Dalny. More than
forty transports will be the total that
have sailed since February 10, and
still larger embarkation is proceeding

RUSSIANS PLEASED
BY AMERICAN'S GIFT
TO HOSPITAL FUND
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 26.â The
giving of $10,000 by Charles A. Crane
of Chicago to the "Young Empress"
fund for Russian soldiers and sailors
has been received everywhere with ex
pressions of appreciation. Her Majes
ty was deeply touched by the donation.
The gift was made by Crane through
Count Rostosoff, his Majesty's Chan
cellor, i ~
Crane has cabled that it was be
lieved In America â¢ that Russia has
done everything to maintain peace, but
that her had been forced by a
treacherous enemy.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.-Couut
Cassini, the Russian Embassador,. has
received from his Government an* ex
ceedingly cordial cable dispatch in re
sponse to his message sent to St.
Petersburg Beveral days ago regard-
Ing the numerous offers of American
doctors and nurses to give their ser
vices to the Russian army * and navy
in the Far Eastern war. . The Embas
sador is invited by his Government to
assure the Americans that his Majesty
has been deeDly touched by this rÂ«-
newed evidence of kindly spirit on the
part of the Americans, and that, al
though the Government of the Em
peror is profoupdly appreciative of
these offers, the overwhelming number
of doctors and nurses in Russia will
scarcely permit her to accept aid from
other countries. .
It seems that the St. Petersburg au
thorities are besieged with requests
from all over Russia from subjects to
go to the front either in a military
or medical capacity.
One hundred and fifty letters were
received at the Russian embassy to
day from persons expressing their
sympathy for Iiussia in the Far East
ern war. Many of these are from
business men, tvho express the hope
that the relations between Russia and
the United States may continue
friendly.
CITIZENS OF THIS
COUNTRY EXPELLED
FROM MANCHURIA
YINGTSE. Manchuria, Feb. 26.â An
American refugee from Harbin â  says
the authorities there have discriminated
in the expulsion of Americans, Japan
ese and British subjects. Persons of
other nationalities have not been mo
lested. This is virtually the situation
at other places, and especially at Port
Arthur, where nearly all the Germans
are officers.
The few American and British sub
jects at Port Arthur have been required
to sign an agreement to leave within
a given time.
The authorities say that all Japanese
have left Port Arthur in installments
on the last steamships from there, but
an English refugee says there were 200
Japanese women at Port Arthur un
able to secure a passage and who were
sent north again by the authorities
last Sunday.
These women cannot be accounted
for, although Henry B. Miller, United
States Consul at Newchwang, has re
peated his inquiries concerning their
whereabouts. As a result o* the repre
sentations made by Miller as to his
rights to investigate the cases and care
for them personally, the civil admin
istrator of Newchwang has gone to
see Viceroy AlexiefT.
The rumors of numerous engage
ments on the Ya!u River are discredit
ed here. It is said that Russia has no
definite plan of campaign, and that
she does not intend to move before the
reorganization of the Manchurian reg
iment, which cannot be effected be
fore two or three weeks or a month.
The expectation that the powers will
interfere to secure the protection of
Newchwang has almost been aban
doned.
BRITISH STEAMSHIP
STOPPED BY A SHOT
FROM RUSSIAN CRAFT
ADEN, Arabia, Feb. 26.â A Russian
torpedo-boat destroyer stopped and
hoarded the British Indian steamship
Mombasda. in the Red Sea, on Febru
ary 22. The destroyer fired a gun.
which the Mombassa disregarded, but
a second shot caused the liner to stop.
A Russian officer boarded the Mom
bassa and examined her papers, after
which she was allowed to proceed.
SUEZ, Egypt, Feb. 26.â The Russian
squadron from Jibutil is reported to be
anchored In the Gulf of Suez, twenty
five miles south of Suez. A torpedo
boat, destroyer which had already en
tered the canal, bound northward, ha3
sailed southward again .o rejoin the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOKIO, Feb. 26.â Army and navy
officials, conservative in everything re
lating to the war. issued a bulletin this
evening which they classed as an un
official report because it did not come
from Admiral Togo. The bulletin was
the substance of a dispatch received
from Seoul in the morning and Bent by
I-jeutenant General Iseji. commander
of the sixth military division, com
prising the Eleventh and Twenty-
Third brigades of Infantry, now at the
Korean capital. His Information of the
pea fight on Thursday morning must
have come through Chemulpo by wire
less telegraph from one of the warsh:p3,
but because it is signed by him instead
of the admiral it is bulletined without
any comments by the Government. The
message of Lieutenant General Iseji
carries news of a great victory by tne
Japanese navy. As bulletined it says:
'"On Thursday morning the enemy
was engaged by the fleet, the Russian
cruisers Askold. Bayan and No vile as-

cruisers Toshino. Chitose, Kasagi and
Takasago turned Laothieshan Chan
nel and enjragred three torpedo-boats
in Pigeon Bay. destroying one and
damaging: others. The land batteries
were silenced."
RUSSIAN' FLEET DISABLED.
In addition to this, the Government
has posted a bulletin announcing that
no message has been received directly
from Admiral Togo, but that indirect
information is to the effect that the
Russian fleet is now practically unlit
for naval service because of the dam
apes Fustained in two recent fights
and that Port Arthur channel, while
not securely locked, is dangerous to
navigation.
Naval tacticians here, both native
and foreign, put the greatest emphasis
on that part of the report that the
Askold. the Bayan and the Xovid only
took part In outside engagements. This
leads to the belief that all the Russian
battleships have been damaged by Ad
miral Togo's attack and that the three
cruisers were the only ships able to
come out and meet the Japanese fleet.
The report from the lieutenant general
FUgfrceis that these three cruisers are
now unseaworthy.

NO CAMP SITE
TO BE CHOSEN
Special Dispatch to The Ca.lt.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 26.â It
can be definitely stated there will be
no purchase of a camp site in Califor
nia or any other Western State this
year. The army staff has suggested a
desire that the pending bill be amend
ed so as to cut out the names of all
States or more definite locations
and leave the several appropriations
remain, placing the money at the dis
posal of the staff to purchase the sites
where they deem best. The military
committee having the matter under
consideration has not taken kindly to
the proposition. Not wishing to fly
directly in the face of the expressed
wish of the staff, nor yet willing to
concede as much as they require the
committee will allow the bill to die.
It is understood that the staff intend
ed to purchase three sites, one of which
was to be In Kentucky, another the
Chickamauga Park and the third not
stated. There was to be none, however,
on the Pacific Coast.
TRY TO KILL
UTAH SHERIFF
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Feb. 26.â One
man dying, one fatally wounded and
two others injured is the result of a
battle between bandits and an officer
of the law on a passenger train on the
San Pedro road to-night. The battle
was the result of an attempt on the
part of Sheriff Hickman to arrest two
men supposed to be the perpetrators of
the robbery of railroad laborers at
Calientes a few nights ago.
Two men acting suspiciously boarded
train No. 2 at Modena, near the State
line, and the Sheriff at Milford was
notified. When the train arrived there
at 11:50 o'clock to-night he entered the
day coach where a number of Italians
were. He was followed by the Town
Marshal and several men acting as
deputies.
When the Italians saw the Sheriff
they opened fire on him, thinking he
was a robber. A general fusillade fol
lowed, the foreigners doing most of the
shooting. The Sheriff lost a finger, the
Town Marshal was shot through the
hand and a man behind him was struck
in the head and probably fatally in
jured. !
During the excitement the two strange
men seen boarding the train at Mo
dena slipped from the train and started
up < the track. When the shooting
stopped 'the Sheriff took the guns away
from the Italians and marched them to
the city jail. Then he formed a posse
to hunt for the escaped men. One of
them was found a short distance from
the depot, lying on the ground near the
pumphouse, shot through the abdomen.
His name Is not known. He is fatally
injured. The second man has not yet
been captured.
The eho6ting caused a panic among
the passengers on the train, which waa
delayed at Milford more than an hour.

sunset to-night ten engines were pour
ing streams of water on the ruins of
most of the retail drygoods quarter of
Rochester. Three of the five depart
ment stores in Rochester were con
sumed in a fire to-day which caused
a loss of more than $3,000,000. The Sib
ley, Lindsay & Curr Company, the
largest retail store in Rochester, was
destroyed. Of the loss $735,000 repre
sents buildings, and. the remainder
stocks and furnishings. It is said that
2500 persons were thrown out of work
by the fire.
The burned region lies on the north
side of Main street, between St. Paul
street and Clinton avenue.north running;
from St. Paul street almost the entire
length of the block. The fire started
In the store of the Rochester Drygoods
Company and worked west, burning
only one store east of this establish
ment, that of (,he Walkover Shoe Com
pany, before its progress was checked
in that direction. $ext was the store
of the Beadle-Sherburne Company,
which was destroyed.
Then the marble block.occupied by the
Sibley, Lindsay &. Curr Company, was
destroyed, and finally the thirteen
story granite building, the lower floor
of which was also occupied by the
Sibley, Lindsay & Curr Company and
the upper part by offices, was attacked.
Only the " front wall of the marble
building is standing to-night. The shell
of the granite building is Intact and
the floors are in place, but the building
Is gutted.
The Sibley, Lindsay & Curr Com

000. '':â¢:'< / â¢
There were a livery stable and some
frame dwellings on Division street, a
narrow thoroughfare running in the

by a flying nozzle. The power on the
trolley line running along Main street
was cut off to avoid danger from elec
tricity and no cars have run through

HOUSE PASSES
THE NAVY BILL
WASHINGTON. Feb. 26.â The House
passed the naval appropriation bill to
day after having had it under consid
eration for a week. There was a party
contest on a number of proposals dur
ing the day and especially on an effort
of different minority members to secure
an amendment to fix the price, of ar
mor plate at the figure bid by the Mid
vale Steel Company. Several amend
ments were ruled out on points of ojv
der and the Republican leaders by par
liamenlary tactics left the question of
armor plate in the discretion of the
Secretary of the Navy. An ineffectual
attempt was made to have the eight
hour law applied to all ship construc
tion. The contest over submarine boats
was exciting and an amendment finally
was adopted which leaves the question
of the type of boat open, but increases
the amount of the appropriation for
such boats. The minority failed to se
cure a record vote on the proposal to
recommit with instructions, the pro
posed instructions being declared out
of order.
At 5 p. m. the committee rose and
the bill was reported to the House.
Meyer (Dem.) of Louisiana moved to
recommit to the Committee on Naval
Affairs, with instructions to report a
bill providing for a coaling station at
Olangapo. P. I., eliminating the pro
vision for two armored cruisers:
placing a limit of $398 a ton on armor
plate, or, as an alternative, directing
the Secretary of the Navy to erect ia
Government armor-plate factory; pro
viding that all ships authorized by, the
bill, except the . battleships, shall
be constructed In Government yards;
providing, that no part of the money
paid for armor plate shall be paid to
a concern in a trust, and limiting to
eight hours a day work on all Govern
ment contracts.
Foss made the point > of order that
new legislation was proposed by Meyer,
and was sustained by the chair.
Payne cut off further debate by
moving to recommit the bill to the
Committee on Naval Affairs, and then
he and his Republican associates de
feated the motion, 138 to 99.
The bill then passed without opposi
tion and the House adjourned.

That the Japanese Will Eventu

Cyrus Townsend Brady of New York,

PISTOL SHOT
CAUSES ALARM
Considerable excitement was oc
casioned in the vicinity of Pine and
Jones streets shomly after 11 o'clock
last night by a pistol shot and the sub
sequent arrest of a suspected burglar.
The scene of the affair is in the center
of the fashionable boarding-house dis
trict, and it was some time before the
guests of the neighboring hotels had
sufficiently composed themselves to
again retire.
While Mrs. George N. Howard was
sitting in her apartments in the "The
Newport," 1018 Pine street, she was
startled by some one endeavoring to
unfasten one of the windows from the
outside. She summoned her husband,
George X. Howard of Shreve & Co.,
from an adjoining room and, upon
raising the blinds, both were startled
to see a fellow on a shed in the rear oj
the house, peering into the rooms occu
pied by Mrs. Green. Howard at once
dispatched his wife to notify Mrs.
Green and then gave the alarm.
E. C. Price of the treasury depart
ment of the Southern Pacific Company,
who resides in the house, got a glimpse
of the fellow and fired a shot at him.
but without any known damage. How
ard saw the man jump from the shed
and run up the street.
Special Officer C. S. Mahnke and Pa
trolman Daley were in the vicinity and
hastened to the scene. At the corner
of Jones and Pine streets they met a
fellow perspiring freely and out of
breath. He was placed under arrest
and taken back to the "Newport."
Howard, although unable to positively
identify him, said that he resembled
the man he had seen on the roof. When
taken to the Central Station the pris
oner gave the name of Henry Noon and
stated that he was a sailor on the ship
Lismore, which came over from Oak
land yesterday.
His only explanation of his presence
in the neighborhood in question at such
a late hour was that heÂ»was merely
taking a stroll. His statements were
contradictory and his name was placed
on the detinue book pending an inves
tigation.
Death of Louis Klkus.
Louis Elkus, a well-known citizen,
passed away yesterday at his late

and transports the enemy advanced
four freighters. In ballast, at fu!l

intended to sink the latter vessels;
but the maneuver was immediately
observed on the battleship Retvizan,
which was standing in the bay before
the entrance. The Retvizan at once
opened fire and after it the batteries
on the peak and those on the promon
tory took oart. As a result the ships
with whici it was designed to block
ade thfe port were destroyed and their
mission rendered unsuccessful. Ac
cording to a wholly unsupported re
port one Japanese torpedo-boat waa
sunk."
TOGO'S SHIPS XOT DAMAGED.
TQKIO. Feb. 26. â Vice Admiral
Togo's attempt to bottle up the Rus
sian fleet at Port Arthur by sinking
a fleet of stone-laden merchant steam
ers in the mouth of the harbor evi
dently failed, though the venture
caused no loss of life and the vessels
lost were not of great value. Five
ships were prepared by Vice Admiral
Togo for the attempted blockade. Four
are reported to have been sunk, but
the fate of the fifth Is unknown here.
It is presumed that it withdrew with
the other Japanese vessels. The five
vessels were filled with stone.3, so as
to make the obstruction permanent,
and were manned by volunteer mer
chant crews. It was Impossible to se
lect naval officers and sailors on ac
count of their great rivalry to par
ticipate in the daring venture.
Accompanied by four batleships.
nine cruisers and numerous vessels
of the torpedo flotilla, the stone-laden
steamships reached Port Arthur on
Wednesday. While the fleet engaged
the shore batteries the steamships
made a dash for the mouth of the har
bor, directly under the Russian guns.
ALL OF THE CREWS ESCAPE.
Details of the attack have not been
received here, but it is evident that
the Russian fire sank the steamships
before they reached the points plan
ned for their foundering by the Jap
anese. It is said that all of the crews
of the four vessels escaped in boats
and were picked up by Japanese tor
pedo-boat destroyers. The report that
two of the torpedo-boat destroyers
were sunk by the Russians is denied.
The naval department has received
a brief dispatch from the commander
of one of the torpedo-boat destroyers,
saying that no Iive3 and no warships
were lost and that no damage was in
flicted by the Russians. Pending the
receipt of the official report of Vice
Admiral Togo the Navy Department
declines to make any announcement
regarding the affair.
The five merchant vessels which
were prepared for sinking were the
Jinsen Maru of 2331 tons; the Tien

Uncle Sam's Cavalry and Artillery Stationed at the Presidio
Make Brilliant Showing at Inspection by Major Wisser in
Spite of Rain, Hail and Hurricane Blasts of Southerly Wind
Uncle Sam's cavalry and field artil
lery stationed at the Presidio made n
great showing yesterday in the annual
Inspection and review with all the odd?
cf tire elements agair.et them.
Despite rain, hail, snow and almost
a hurricane of wind, the full pro
gramme of inspection, in accordance
with army regulations, was carried
out. The golf links was the scene cf
action, and most admirably it served.
Promptly at & o'clock Major John P.
Wisser. the reviewing officer, came on
the field and immediately after the
third squadron of the Ninth Cavalry
and the first, fifth and twenty-fourth
batteries of the field artillery, followed
by thÂ«Â» hospital corps, came trooping
up i he hill and dashed into the
grounds. Captain Charles A. Bennett
v-as in command of the provisional
battalion of field artillery. Captain
Lester W. Cornish in command of tho
< avaSry, Major William Stepher.son in
< harge of the hospital corps, and Major
John Bipelow Jr. in command of all
troops participating in the review. Th3
troops formed facing north; the cav
alry being at the right and the artil
lery at the left. At the beginning of
the function Major Bigrelow signaled
â¢attention and the commanders of the
< avairy and artillery gave the order
to the troops to draw sabers. In an
instant the glittering steels sprang
from th^ir scabbards.
At the signal of the commanding of
f'cer the different commanders of the
trocps in review pave the order to pre
sent sabers, and the commander of th-?
force in review faced about and sa
luted the inspecting officer. Major
Wisser.
Then came the command of "platoon
right." At the signal of forward the
troops moved, and after changing di
rection to the left passed by the re
viewing ofllrer on the walk, the field
music cf the troops turning out in
front of the reviewing: officers and
playing while the organizations passed
the reviewing stand. After the troops
had made the third charge they went
into a Eharp trot, the artillery going at
full jrallop around the turns.
The cavalry formed in columns of
troops at full distance on the right,
while the artillery occupied a position
on the sloping hill to the left, where the
troops were minutely inspected. Then
to the observer came the most interest
the feature of the dayâ camp pitching.
This included unpacking, unsaddling,
rutting down r-icket line, tying horses,
unrolling the packs, buttoning together
the shelter halves and filching the
tents. Great dexterity was shown in
this feature by all the troops. Troop I,
Captain Young, however, won the laurels
by executing the order, complete in
every detail, in thirteen minutes.
The pitching of the officers' tents fol
lowed. They were struck thirty yards
from the flank of the troopers', while
the tents of the field and staff officers
were still thirty yards farther away.
The artillery did not pitch shelter tents,
but instead put up conical wall tents.

warfare. Fires were brightly burning
in the army camp stoves, troopers were
busily engaged in burnishing up their
arms, the horses were either nibbling
grass or disporting themselves by roll
ing, sentries were pacing up and down
the rank?, while the officers were in
consultation, apparently awaiting the
next order from the commander in
chief. The wind, which up to this time
had been blowing in strong southerly
gusts, now developed almost hurricane
force. Hats were flying in all direc

been killed by the falling timber, but
all escaped with the exception of two
plasterers, James Byron and Barney
McBrlde, who were standing on the
portion of the scaffold when, it gave
way. Byron fell to the main floor of
the building and was instantly killed.
McBride, who was working with By

SPRING TRADE
IS BACKWARD
Business Proceeding on Con
servative Basis So That a
Setback May Be Avoided
VIOLENT FLUCTUATIONS
Prices of Leading Commodi
ties Indicate a Situation
That Is Due to Speculation
NEW YORK. Feb. 26.â R. G. Dun's
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow
will say:
In addition to the interruption of a
holiday trade and transportation, in
dustries have again suffered because
of severe weather and much outdoor
work was forced to await more favor
able conditions. Development of spring
trade is naturally slow, but this may
be fully made up as the season I ad
vances. Business- proceeds on a con;
servative basis that promises immunity
from the excesses that precipitated the
recent setback. Manufacturing plants
are gradually restoring idle machinery
and there is more disposition to antici
pate future requirement. Staple com
modities are still inflated by war news
and manipulations, making it ex
tremely difficult to ascertain the actual
legitimate situation.
Aside from some special pressure to
sell foundry iron in order to meet pay
ments the market is steadily expand
ing.
Violent fluctuations have continu-d
in the great staples, legitimate influ
ences being supplemented by manipu
lation and realizing sales precipitating
reactions. Wide changes from day to
day in the leading commodities indi
cate an unwholesome and undesirable
situation that is due to speculation and
that is calculated to check or divert
consumptive demand. Wheat led the
advance and was closely followed by
the minor cereals, but flour was less
erratic and as a result exports were
mainly confined to the latter.
Failures this waek numbered 240 in
the United States against 211 last year,
and twenty-two In Canada, compared
with twenty-eight a year ago.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â Bradstreet's
this week says: Spring trade Is assert
ing itself despite abnormally cold
weather, heavy snows or* congested
transportation facilities In widely sepa
rated sections. Where weather condi
tions have been favorable, as from the
South, distributive trade has been good.
Buying Js generally classed as conser
vative. Manufacturing industry shows
some enlargement of activity, especial
ly in glassmaking and iron and steel,
the production of pig iron being nearly
double that of two months ago.
Failures are few in number for this
season of the year, considering the be
lated spring season. It is still too early
to report upon the winter wheat situa
tion, but advices so far are encouraging
in the Southwest, absence of snow cov
ering or lack of moisture being reported
in Missouri, Oklahoma and Kansas.
New record prices for the year and
the highest, in fact, since May, 18S8,
were reached In wheat this week. Flour
prices reflect the strength, and corn
and oats have sympathized, as have
also nearly all kinds of products except
eggs, which have broken sharply, the
advance in pork being to the highest
point. The Eastern war also affects
products, such as tea and camphor,
which are closely connected with the
scene of hostilities. .
On the Pacific Coast San Francisco
reports increased orders for hardware
and groceries. Salt Lake City reports
Improved trade and mining Interests
buying machinery freely.
War talk is still an influence tending
to strengthen food products, but to de
press raw cotton. Collections are still
unsatisfactory at most Northern mar
kets. Railway earnings are not as en
couraging as in the past, owing partly
to the congestion growing out of block
aded shipments, but partly to cutting
of grain freight rates. '
POLICE SEARCHING FOR
MAN WHO STRUCK KELLEY
Victim of Assault In San Jose Is Re-
covering, but >t lie Mystery Is
Unsolved.
SAN JOSE. Feb. 26.â The mystery
attending the fracturing of the skull
of James Kelley in his own home on
February 16 last is baffling the police
department. Although Kelley had
been at death's door for the last ten
days, it was only yesterday that the
matter was reported to the police. The
Injured man is now at St. Luke's Hos
pital. About 10 o'clock on the night
of February 16 Kelley was standing
In a doorway in his home talking to
members of his family. Suddenly he
was struck a stunning blow by some
one who crept up behind him. He
was felled to the floor and put to
bed, and the next morning It was
found " that his skull was fractured.
At the hospital It was found that the
fractured portion of the skull was
resting on the brain and trepanning
was necessary. Kelley is now out of
danger, but he can jrive no Informa
tion as to who his assailant was.

SUPERVISORS CONSIDER NEW
RATES FOR GAS AND WATER
Russell L. Dunn, the Specially Employed Engineer, Is
Unable to Make an Estimate of Value of Spring Valley
Water Company's Plant and Is Given Further Time
The Supervisors, sitting yesterday as
a committee of the whole, continued
the investigation as to the value of
the plants of the Spring Valley Water
Company and the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company. Manager Law
less of the gas company was the only
witness examined in the gas investi
gation, and he made an excellent wit
[ ness for the company.
,He had figures and statistics to burn
; when they would brighten things for
i his company. His testimony as well
as being statistical was to a great ex
tent argumentative and was aimed to
impress upon the minds of the Super
visors that the gas company has more
troubles than could be tc-ld to the en
tire police force and is furnishing both
gas and electricity at a reasonable fig
ure. -
The afternoon session of the board
was wholly occupied with hearing the
t.stimony or failure to give testimony
of Russell L. Dunn, who was employed
as an expert to assist City Engineer
Grunsky in placing a valuation on the
plant of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany. Dunn did very little to en
lighten the members of the board, but
promised he would do better next time.
When placed on the stand he read
a long list of the comparative values
of units of Spring Valley property ac
cording to the estimates made in pre
vious years and figured on the de
terioration in their value during a pe
riod of ten years.
This did not serve to enlighten the
members of the board, however, who
were anxious to get a valuation of the
property as it stands to-aay, but it
precipitated an argument which for a
time was very warm.
Dunn explained that it was difficult
for him to arrive at a valuation of the
property, as all listed in Schussler's
report is not at present in use, and he
had been unable to segregate the items.
Supervisor Braunhart then asked the
direct question: "What is your valua
tion of the property?" "It is impos
sible for me to state, as there is no evi
dence of the cost," was the reply.
' "But you were employed to make an
estimate of the value?"
"I am not able to make one."
"Then you have not done the work
you were employed by the city to do,"
retorted Braunhart, with some warmth.
Supervisors Comte and Brandenstein
then took a hand in the questioning
and finally induced the witness to make
a rough estimate of the value of the
plant. He said the best he could do
was to guess within 53,000,000 of the
actual value, and on that basis he
would judge the property was worth
from $19,000,000 to $25,000,000. Allowing
a $3,000,000 margin on this either way
for bad guessing, the Supervisors con
sider that he allowed them a reason
able latitude.
After, a rig-id cross-questioning, in
which if. developed that Dunn either
knew nothing of the value of the prop
erty in question or was unwilling to tell
if he did, he agreed to file a statement
with the committee Monday morning
provided he is furnished with certain
information. He was informed that the
data he desired was on file and at his
disposal during the entire period cov
ered by the Investigation.
It was the opinion of the witness that
if meters were installed in all places
where water is served the public would
be better satisfied. He had not figured
on the cost of installing some 90,000
meters at an average cost of $15 each.
The witness was finally dismissed after
promising to furnish the board with a
written statement Monday morning.
Prior to the testimony of Dunn an
Itemized statement was filed showing
the location of various pieces of prop
erty, their value as estimated by the
company and the taxes paid thereon.
According to this statement the com
pany is at present paying annually
about $150 taxes on property not in use.
This Indicates that the idle property Is
worth only $.15,000.
ESTIMATE IS UNFAIR.
Manager Lawless Claims the .Gas
Company Is Unjustly Criticized.
Manager Lawless of the San Francis
co Gas and Electric Company again oc
cupied the stand at yesterday's session
by the Board of Supervisors, which is
proceeding to fix gas rates for the year.
The questioning was carried on chiefly
by Brandenstein and Braunhart, who
presented the witness with a compara
tive table showing the cost 'of manufac
ture of gas by the Equitable Company
and the figures presented by the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company
as to the cost of manufacturing and
distributing the product.
The figures showed a vast difference,
which Manager Lawless proceeded to
explain away by saying that the figures
were unfair. Those of the Equitable
Company, he said, were taken for the
month of January when the consump
tion of gas is greatest and were placed
against an average figure for the entire
year by his company. He also pointed
out that the Equitable Company sold
gas only in the heart of the city while
his company's service pipes extended
for miles into thinly populated districts
where the consumption of gas Is very
light.
"According to these figures," he said,
"the Equitable Company, with nfneteen
miles of pipe, sold one-fourth of all the
gas consumed in the city, although the
total mileage Is 527." The Equitable
Company also, he said, made no .esti
mate for depreciation in value of its
plant, and as the customers were close
together the distributing expenses were
.materially lessened.
A large portion of, the morning was
occupied in collecting data regarding
the cost of producing and distributing
electricity. Manager Lawless testi
fied that the company is '"unable to
manufacture sufficient current and
annually purchases a quantity from
the Standard Company. He admitted
that his concern can purchase cur
rent from the Standard ' Company
cheaper than it can manufacture it,
but the Standard's supply, is* uncertain.
It is transmitted over" 150 miles of
wire and an accident at any .time
might cut off the supply entirely. For
this reason large investments have
been made In new machinery In order
that the local concern may be able
to supply all demands without asking
outside aid.
He presented a mass of figures
showing: the cost of producing cur
rent, including among the items inter
est on the company's bonds and insur
ance. Brandenstein objected to these
items being included in cost of pro
duction and was backed up by Braun
hart. who argued that the interest on
money borrowed to start a manufac
turing plant was not a portion of the
cost of producing the article, but
should go to the profit and loss ac
count.
"Very well," replied the witness
smilingly, "in the future we will
charge it up under a different name,
but it must be there Just the same, as
it is a portion of our expenses."
The committee has taken the evi
dence presented under consideration
and expects to be able to present an
ordinance at the meeting of the board
Monday afternoon.
PRAISE FOR GRUNSKY.

The Mokelumne River overflowed its

this morning. A seventy-five foot break
occurred on the Dave Ray place, and
about a half-mile of the levee gave way

FEATHER RIVER RECEDING.
Country XortJi of Marjsrille Is One
Vast Sea of Water.
JIARYSVILLE, Feb. 26. âThe flood
situation remains unchanged to-night.
Rain has fallen heavily all day, with
prospects for further precipitation dur
ing the night. While the flow of water
in the Yuba has receded during the past
twenty-four hours it still clings to the
high water mark, nineteen feet, and
it is reported from the Government
barriers, thirteen miles up the river, to
be rising again. The rise is due, no
doubt, to the heavy rainfall in the
mountains to-day.
The Feather River has receded but
little and the country to the north is
one- vast sea of water. The Sutter
County levee has withstood the great
strain, but some cross embankments
holding back the overflow have given
way, flooding a great deal of valuable
land between Yuba City and Knights
Landing, near Tudor. The Knights
Landing railroad was washed out and
the rails were under water for several
miles. One thing in favor of the levee
is the absence of wind. Hundreds of
men are watching the great dykes and
the residents of this city feel perfectly
secure. Train service from the south
was resumed this evening, the wash
out between here and Reed Station
having been repaired. The San Fran
cifco mail from the north arrived this
morning; also belated passengers
coming by way of Tehama.
A heavy flow is running through the
break in the levee on the south of the
Yuba and the country for miles around
is under water. Much damage to grow
ing crops will result if the current is
very Pivift and cutting. Travel by teams
from this point is entirely suspended.
Five feet of water covers the Fifth
street grade leading to Yuba City, and
the street cars have given way to boats.
The Oroville branch of the railroad line
is covered by eight feet of water for
miles along the Feather River. The flood
â water has broken all records and the
people are rejoicing over the way the
city levee system has withstood the
pressure. No alarm is now felt.
The rainfall for the season is about
Fixteen inches and, outside of the dam
age by flood water, has been very bene
ficial. Reports from Biggs and Gridley
say that water is still running through
the towns.
AMERICAN RIVER RISES.
Heavy Rainfall in the Mountains
Causes tlic Stream to Boom.
COLFAX, Feb. 26. â What has
proven to be the heaviest storm in re
cent years has continued without cas
sation for four days. The rain ceased
for a short time early this morning,
but it soon began to fall again and ac
companied by a heavy gale continued
nil day.' All the streams are running
bank full. The American River, which
-was reported falling yesterday even
ing, is again very high. It is reported
by a man who is watching the bridge
on the Iowa Hill road to be twenty
feet above low water. The weather
observer here reports the" rainfall for
the last thirteen hours to be one and
a half inches. This br^jgs the total
rainfall for the seasof^to 44.43 as
compared with 31.13 at this time last
year. Rain has been fallhig at all
points between here and Truckee. Re
ports just received are to the effect
that the rain has turned to heavy*
snow east of Emigrant Gap. All the
westbound trains are delayed by the
storm. Many small slides create de T

HIGH WATER AT COLUSA.
Sacramento River Is RLsine and
Levees Arc Beins Patrolled.
- COLUSA, Feb. 26.â The Sacramento
River at this point continues to rise
and as heavy rains are reported to-day
up north and on the Stony Creek
watersheds there is no telling what will
be the outcome. The entire east side
of the river from within a few feet of
the approach of fhe Colusa free draw
bridge is under from two to seventeen
feet of water and for miles up and
down the river Ftock is being fed on
the levee tops. As yet no loss of stock
is reported. The river this evening reg
isters twenty-seven feet eight inches,
which is within one inch of the high
est ' mark ever registered here. A
new mark will surely be maCe before
to-morrow morning. If it were not for
the Moul'on break a few miles above
town on the east side, where it is esti
mated at least one-quarter of the flood
waters are now pouring out, the water
here would be running over the tops
of the levees along the Colusa side.
The entire water front at Colusa can
stand about two feet more. It Is b2
lieved th-t the levees will hold out,
although several bad holes were dis
covered this afternoon. They were
Â«niÂ«-viv repaired. The entire river
front, will be patrolled from now until
the water begins to recede.
At Butte City, about twenty miles
north of Colusa, John Eichman, one
of the best known citizens of that town,
lost his life in the flood. In company
with Minister Williams and John Mc-
Reynolds he started out Thursday i in
a boat for a hunt. While rowing down
what before the floods was the county
road they ran into a swift current
which swamped their boat and they
were thrown into the water. Williams
and McReynolds succeeded in reaching
shore, but Eichman was carried down
stream by the rushing waters. He was
seen to grasp the limb of a tree, pull
himself partly out of the water and
to cry for help, but before assistance
could reach him his strength failed
and he sank from sight. The body has
not been and likely never will be re
covered. He leaves a wife and child.
LITTLE DA3IAGE IX TEHAMA.
Heavy Rain in Mountains Likely to
Cause Rise in the River.
RED BLUFF. Feb. 26. â The dam
age from high water in Tehama
County is comparatively light. Red
Bluff is situated fifty feet above river
level and Is in no danger of a flood.
There was a heavy rainfall last night
and to-day, but the Sacramento River
fell slowly and stood at eighteen feet
at dusk this evening, compared with
twenty-eight feet three inches ten
days ago. It is raininrj heavily in the
mountains and the next twenty-four
hours may see a decided change in
the river. Antelope Valley east of
here was cut off except by communi
cation by boat, for several days until
this afternoon owing to high water
In the slough east of the Sacramento
bridge. Tehama County has about
twenty steel bridges across its streams,
but none of these has been damaged
seriously except the approaches. Pitts
& Sons of Bloody Island lost nineteen
head of cattle and one to two hundred
hogs by the recent flood. The cattle
and sheep on the Cone ranch pas
tured on islands in the Sacramento
River were moved to high ground be
fore the hinh water came.
United States Weather Observer
Maurice Connell has been very active
in issuing warnings of approaching
high water, thus enabling the farm
ers to move their stock out of dan
ger, and as far south as Colusa his
warnings have been most timely and
highly appreciated. The rainfall for
this season to date is about equal to
that at the same time, last season.
Grass is gTowingr rapidly and the out
look for cattle, sheep and hogs is most
promising.

The precipitation for the storm is .70
'of an inch; for the season, 29. SI,
against 26.70 up to this time last year.
Most all of the . rain this season has

The rainfall for the season approxi
mates twelve inches.
Sherman Island May Be Flooded,
ANTIOCH, Feb. 26. â There is great
apprehension felt for the safety of the
levees on Sherman Island owing to
the high water and the fact that the
dredger Sierra is now out of commis
sion. It is estimated that it will cost
$4000 to raise the dredger from the
river bottom.
Raining in Santa Clara Valley.
SAN JOS'E. Feb. 26. â Rain began fall

noon and there was a heavy downpour
until 7 o'clock to-night. Forty-one
hundredths of an inch fell in that
time. During the month of February
3.15 inches of rain has fallen, mak
ing a total of 6.78 for the season. To
this date last year there was 10.13
inches. It is cloudy and threatening
to-night and it Is. believed the storm
will continue. Everybody is rejoicing
and good crops for Santa Clara Coun

good for a steady fall all night. The
southern part of the county has had
no rain during the present storm. The
rain of the early part of the week

ST. LOUIS, Feb. 26.â Countess Marie

here to-day in the Circuit Court from
Count'Henri de Penalosa. In her peti
tion the Countess, who is a St. Louis
heiress, charged that the Count had
spent her fortune and had paid at

Miss Christine Mena, testified that
while he was still married to his pres

the Count, when charged with v being
married, admitted as much, but said
he expected to secure a divorce shortly.
morning, which was not sufficient to
lay the. dust, Los Angeles has received
no part of the general rainstorm
which "has been sweeping down the
coast. At midnight, however, the. sky
was heavily overcast and there was
every indication that rain would fall
before daylight. The wind is in the
right quarter to bring rain, and rain
is predicted' by the local branch of the
Weather Bureau.
The rainfall to date , has been less
than three inches as compared with
nearly fifteen inches on the corre
sponding date last year.
â¢ STREETS ARE FLOODED.
Homes in the Mission Arc Inundated
â Much Damngc Done.
Rain and wind swept the streets of
San Francisco yesterday afternoon,
making it the â worst day pedestrians
have seen this winter. The rainfall was
only half an inch, but what the water
lacked in volume was more than made
up by the velocity with which the
storm drove it under umbrellas and
into faces. In some parts of the city
the streets were flooded, street cars
stopped, cellars overflowed and damage
amounting to many thousands of dol
lars was done.
The worst sufferers from the torrent
were the residents of the Mission. Along
Folsom street, between Fourteenth and
Nineteenth, and extending a block east
and west the land is low, and the
sewers, long neglected by the Board of
Public Works, proved wholly unequal
to the task of carrying off even so
small a flood. AH along Folsom street,
in the section named, the manhole-caps
were thrown off by trie force of the
water, and streams shot six or eight
feet into the air.
The women and children living in
John Center's four one-story cottages,
on the west side of Folsom street, be
tween Sixteenth and Seventeenth, were
parried out of their homes on the backs
of employes of th% Works Board. The
ground here is low, and the cottages
were surrounded by several feet of
water, which^rose indoors high enough
to put out the fires in kitchen stoves.
Farther west, at Fifteenth and Shot
well streets, the thorqughfare was
flooded two feet deep, and every cellar
for blocks was full of water. On Folsom
street, owing to the depth of water,
it was necessary 'for the street railway
company to provide planks on which
passengers might pass from the side
walks to the cars and vice versa. * At
last, however, the water became so deep
as to interfere with the electric power
and the cars were stopped altogether"
for several hours.
DAMAGED BY
â¢ The Enterprise Brewing Company, at
Sixteenth and Folsom streets, suffered
perhaps the greatest damage by the
flood. Its "entire premises were over
flowed and much damage was done to
its plant, including a valuable set, of
scales which, it is believed, were ruined
by the water and mud that rushed in
from the. street.
Down at the Seventeenth-street police
station, which was an island In the
midst of a lake, the officers in going
and coming had to be hauled in a patrol
wagon to and from their headquarters.
Many and loud were the complaints
of Mission residents against the Board
of Public Works, because of the sewers
blocked with filth, no attempt to re
move which having been made in
weeks. Hundreds of overflowed cellars
are the result of this 'neglect on the
part of the board, and Ios3 of property
with unlimited possibilities of sickness
will be charged to the same cause.
Among the heaviest losers are the
owners of saloons and corner groceries
in the flooded district. One of the suf
ferers, Henry Kleen, a grocer at Six
teenth and Folsom streets, said last
night:
I have repeatedly called the attention of
the Board of Public Works to the fact that
tns Folsom-street sewer at this point is filled
with dirt I have no doubt there is ten feet
of solid earth In the manhole outside my
house. The. resujt of the board's failure to
d.-> anything in answer to my complaints -was
seen to-day. The water from the higher ground
south of ub rushed down in the sewers, blew
the caps off the manholes and ehot high Into
the air. The surface water from-the nelgh
borine section of course could not find an
escape through the sewers and hence we
were flooded several- feet deep. _ The water
from the street poured through the cellar grat
ings and filled every basement In the vicinity.
If the eewers had been properly cleaned at
reasonable intervals there would have been
no trouble whatever from such a compara
tively slight rainfall as we had. to-day.
' The submerged streets remained
flooded* for several hours after the rain
stopped, but by midnight they were,
with few exceptions, free from any
large amount of standing water. The
cellars will require some days, however,
to empty of their foul contents, and in
many cases this will have to be done
by pumping them out by hand.
The rush of water and mud was so
great at the corner of Union and Baker
streets, down the hill, that it threw
the wire cable of the street railway off
from three of the pulleys and stopped
cars for an hour. The conduit had to
be ooened for a long distance and the
solid mass <SI mud dug out. This 5s
said 'to,'. be. the first time such a thing
has happened in the city.
DETAILS OF THE STORM.
Yesterday's storm was extensive and
of unusual severity. Tlie rainfall was
nothing extraordinary, but the wind
was \extremely violent at widely sep-
MINES NOW HAVE ENOUGH
WATER FOR THE SEASON
If Labor Troubles Can Be Settled the .Outlook Is. Good for
a Long Run, as Snow Is Banked Up in the Mountains
Sufficiently Deep to' Insure Uninterrupted Operations
Unless something that is not now
foreseen should happen the outlook for
a good mining season in California is
excellent. There is no longer any ques-^
tion concerning an ample "water supply
to keep the mines of all sorts running
for many months. At present there is
too much water and some mines have
been compelled to suspend temporarily.
The snow is a guarantee of a long sea
son if the winter weather holds and the
snow does not melt too suddenly. The
streams in Siskiyou County have been
higher within the last week than at any
time since 1861. , â¢ .
â¢ In all directions there is enough water
stored up in snow to be a cause of good
cheer to the miners. Operations on
gravel claims in ffevada County have
been discontinued in some localities
while the waters are at flood. The An
gels Record says 1 that there has not
been in many years a snowfall equal to
that of the last few days in the north
ern part ofthe Sierra watershed. Mines
and electric power companies alike will
be the beneficiaries. More than seven
inches of snow fell in one storm. The
snow does not reach as low as it has in
some earlier years, but it is heavier in
the higher altitudes, and this" is the
ideal condition.
CAUSES FOR STOPPING.
Two California mines have recently
been closed on account of labor trou
bles. One is the Midas mine In Shasta
County and the other is 'the "Rawhide
in Tuolumne County. The localpapers
give accounts of the causes that have
led up to the suspension. The Redding
Free Press* says that notice has been
posted that the Midas has been closed
indefinitely. A brief account of the hap
pening has been contained in telegraph
ic dispatches. The Free Press tells the
story as follows: ;
' Union miners appeared before Mr. Mclntosh
and asked the management to discharge a ma
chinist who was employed last week.
This machinist, according to the claims of
the union men employed at the Midas, had
"scablxd" at the Gladstone and at Iron Moun
tain on the occasion of the labcr troubles at
these places. This machinist was formerly
employed at the Gladstone, whlchtis under the
eame management as the Midas. Last week
he went to' Harrison {Gulch and was given
work by Superintendent Oswald at machinist
on the pumps nnd machines.
Thursday night about forty of the miners
got tog-ether and began ' trouble. They said
they had received word from French Gulch to
the effect that the machinist had "scabbed"
at Iron Mountain and the Gladstone. They In
sulted him and ordered him to leave the camp.
The machinist went down and stayed with Mr.
Mclntosh that night and Friday morning was
put to work as usual.
Not a word further was said to him, but at
noon Friday the day shift refused io go to
wcrk unless the machinist was "fired," and
they demanded that he be discharged. - This
demand was promptly, refused by Mr. Mcln
tosh who gave out the statement that those
not wishing to work could get their time. "No
conclusion was reached and accordingly Mr.
Mclntosh ended the matter by posting the no
tice.'
The machinist who caused the trouble can
not be termed a "scab" In connection with his
work at the Gladstone and Iron Mountain.
There was no strike among the machinists at
either place â not even a sympathetic strike.
The trouble at both places was among the
miners. . . . :
The Midas people havÂ» been anticipating
trouble for some time. There have been In the
camp disturbers who hÂ»vÂ« on several occasions
tried to make trouble for the company. â  Not
long ago there was a walkout on account of
an alleged insufficiency of food. That matter
quieted down and when the lockout of Friday

arated points. The rivers in the north
ern part of California were all rising
rapidly last night. The maximum flow
will be attained to-day, according to
the '"weather bureau officials.
The storm extended over Washington,
Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, Utah and the
northern part of this State. The wind
velocity -was sixty miles an hour at
the mouth of the Columbia River, sixty
at Point Reyes, thirty in the Sacra
mento River Valley, thirty-eight In
Utah, fifty in Nevada and twenty-six
in Idaho.
"So much wind for one storm is re
markable," says Professor McAdte.
"There is jsome chance, that Southern
California will see wet weather to-day,
and the central.and northern sections
of the State are sure of showers. The
rainfall for . San Francisco for the
twenty-four hours ending at 5 o'clock
last night was more than half an inch.
The.rainfall for February thus-far ia
5.86 inches, while the average rainfall
for fifty-three years for the month is
only 3.51 inches. In February, 1878, the
rainfall was 12.52 inches, which is the
record."

THE RAWHIDE SHUT DOYVX.
', A local account of the troubles at the
Rawhide mine is as follows:
The ~ strike of miners -â¢ the Rawhide and
App mines, owned by W. A. Nevills, has prac
tically tied up business at Jamestown and la
very likely to result In bloodshed. The strike
at the App 'has been on for several months,
but it waa only last -Wednesday that the min
ers walked out at the -Rawhide. Nearly all
the strikers are Austrlans and only a few of
them understand English. ,
The strikers are armed and they, have posted
pickets to prevent Captain Nevills taking men
to the mine toe take their places. - r-*
Last Friday Nevills took eight men through
Stockton, to work in the Rawhide. The Btrik-.
ers' pickets met the non-union men at James
town and turned them back. The strikers are
said to ( be unreasonable and . In a dangerous
temper. . Captain Nevills Is a fighter and Is
determined to run his 'mine with' non-union
help. ' . -â 
Ihe Rawhide mine is within the Jurisdiction
of the Jamestown Union, under- whose aus
pices the strike is being conducted. It was
declared for the purpose of securing - an in
crease in the dally wages paid engineers, min
ers and muckers. The rate of wages here
tofore raid at the Rawhide has been as , fol
lows: Engineers. $3; miners, $2 75; muckers.
$2 25. The demand is for an Increase of 25
cents Der day for each class of workers. An
Increase is also asked for other surface em
ployes. \
Captain W. A. Nevills, the owner of the
Rawhide, has been having trouble with the
unions for the past year. He is also owner of
the App mine at Quartz, which has been prac
tically closed down for the past year owing
to the fact that the captain would" not accept
the scale of wages adopted' by the union and
accepted by other mine owners i of that sec
tion. A few weeks ago an attempt to open
the App with non-union miners failed. A' week
ago Saturday the mine started up with a lim
ited force without any regard 'being paid' to
the standing demands of. the union, and up. to
the present no Interference with its operations
has been reDorted. -. â¢. ', V .. j. â '
The Union-Democrat/ 'published at
Soriora, says of the mining: situation as
it now appears: . - Y '. .
The recent rainstorms and the heavy fall
of snow in the mountains indicate that the
water supply will be ample -to insure mining
operations being carried on until late into
the fall. The only thing affecting the mining
Interests of the county at present is the'un
settled condition of labor troubles, but It is
anticipated that ere many weeks have passed
all the differences existing, will : be adjusted
and all our mines and .mills will be In active
operation, and producing heavily in bullion. â¢
INSTRUCTS MIXERS. â
The California Debris Commission
has issued instruction's to the owners
and operators of' hydraulic mines in
this State. While there is little really
new in the notices that have been sent
out, there is a part of the instructions
that has present interest. The hy
draulic miners are notified that "li
censes or permission to mine will not
be given unless the requirements of
the commission are complied with in
reference to the ejection of suitable
restraining barriers or dams. Li
censes, when granted, will be suspend
ed for failure to properly maintain
such barriers or dams or for failure
to make the reports and furnish the
information asked for by the commis
sion. Any dam built before the "In
structions are received from the of
fice of the commission . must be con
sidered . to be erected at the risk of
the parties doing the work- The more
essential "parts of the instructions are
as follows:
When mining has been begun under a
license a report every month must be sub
mitted on one of the blank forms furnished
for this purpose by the commission. In case
of any accident to restraining dam affecting
its efficiency mining must immediately cease
and the commission must be promptly notified.
When a dam becomes full of debris it should
be raised, and the permission of the com
mission must be obtained to raise dams, aud
the work when completed must be Inspected
and approved by the commission before min
ing may be resumed. Dams must be kept
water-tight and a pool at least two feet deep
must be maintained as a settling basin -above
each dam while mining Is in progress. Leaks
must be promptly checked.
y The Marysville Democrat gives de
tails concerning two large new gold
mining dredges to be put on the Hal
lett place, ten miles east of Marys
ville, for the Hammon Company, as
follows:
The machinery and all except about a hun
dred tons of the material is on the ground at
the site of the dredges. Wednesday night
twenty-five carpenters in the employ of the
construction comjiany came to Marysville and'
they, went to the Hallett place to commence
work. Some of ihe men had been employed
In other places in constructing dredges, and
others came from San Francisco, but all of
them are familiar with the work to be done
here. These twenty-five and the force at work
prior to their coming will make a total oÂ£
about sixty men,' who will push the work as
rapidly as can.be and handle it to advantage.
The . excavation where the two dredges are to
be constructed is 500 feet in length and about
200 feet In width, with a depth sufficient to
float them when finished. At present three
large pumps are being run by steam power to
keep the water from the excavation while the
foundation la being laid.
RECENT OPERATIONS.
According to the Amador Dispatch
the "sixty stamps of the Oneida mill
are dropping regularly for the first
time since May, 1902, with good in
dications. The new mill at the Bun
ker Hill' mine at Amador City has be-?
gun operations. The Nevada County
Miner reports that the Union Hill
mine, near Grass Valley, is at work.
The Miner says:
Few people know that work Is beinff carried
on at the Union Hill mine. Grass Valley. The
mine was practically suspended several months
ago when the pumps were stopped. But since
that time I Superintendent Crcller has been
working it In a quiet manner. Of course this
work is done near the surface, as the shaft
being full of water prevents any deep mining
in the main works. A tunnel has betn driven
from the ravine, which runs close to the mine.
After going quite a distance they intersect-d
a vein which runs parallel with the old Union
Hill vein which made the mine famous in
the early days. Considerable work has b*en
done on it and In many places the results
have been , very gratifying.
. The Grass Valley Union reports that
the Allison Ranch mine has been
bonded. The underground workings
are full of water, -which is flowing out
of the shaft. A ! rumor that the prop
erty is under bond to the Empire
Company is denied. The Mining and
Scientific Press gives the following ac
count of proceedings at the G win mine
in Calaveras County:
- The main and south shafts are sunk to a
depth of 2000 and 1000 feet respectively, and
the hoist and mill of 100 stamps are In opera
tion. : In addition to the gold , saved on the
plates there are forty Frue variners .collecting
concentrates. Both the hoist and mill are
run by . water, the former having a head of
330 feet and the 'latter 400 feet. - After using
the water for 'these purposes it is carried one
mile . down the gulch and there ruused to
compress: air for the drills ' and pumps. As
a safetly. measure a boiler plant of three boil
ers . has : been â¢; completed to - furnish steam â¢ in
case anythins should j prevent I use of water.
The hoist at the. main shaft is double, having
lifting capacity of â¢ four tons , 2000 feet at the
rate of- 1500 feet per minute. The gallows
frame' is all steel and measures 118 feet in
height from the collar of the . shaft to â¢ the
roof. The ore 1* dumped from the skips on
two rock breakers and then automatically
loaded, into three-ton- cars- and ; trammed ay
mules into ' the mill. At present the ore he
ing .treated* Is ; taken from the .1600 and 1700
foot ' levels. .A crosscut is being run for the
ledge' at the 1900-foot level- The shoot being
worked Is sixty feet in width. There are *J30
men 'at '; work. The water, from the mine ia
handled with pumps, operated by compressed
air." with . a capacity of : 250.000 gallons per
twenty-four hours, and In car^ of temporary
disability J to them â > two skips are used that

STOR3I WRECKS A TOWN.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 26. â A wind
storm of cyclonic character struck the
little town - of Mount Tabor, a few
miles east of Portland, this morning
and demolished two houses, besides
badly . damaging a ' number of other
buildings. " â¢ '
There were several narrow escapes.
b*ut so far as" learned no one was se
riously injured. *j â¢ -/
r The cyclone' was- accompanied by
a hailstorm of unusual severity.
"TFifty feet north' of the Starbuck
residence,*' which' was "completely de
molished, was ; an unoccupied house
belonging to William Thomas. Being
directly in the path of the tornado,
it .was demolished as quickly as the
other building. .Luckily no one was
lnthe house when the storm struck it.
The building occupied by the gro
cery of. W. T. Henton was wrecked
and the stock scattered in every direc
tion. No, one* was injured there,
though several people had narrow es
capes.
. Davis' store,- just across the street,
was damaged to such an extent that
the stock is practically ruined.
The home of.T. H. Starbuck, an
elder of the Adventist church, was
wrecked by the storm. Starbuck, who
was in his bathroom at the time, was
saved from d,eath by his bath tub,
which prevented falling timbers from
reaching him. His wife and daugh
ter, who were in the kitchen, were
protected in a similar manner by the
cook stove.

Rights on the Isthmus
LEGAL QUESTIONS
TO BE ADJUSTED
Minister Biinan-Varilla of
Panama Cables designa
tion to New Republic After
* Exchange of Katifications
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26â President
Koosevelt to-day signed the proclama
tion putting into effect the treaty with
Panama reparding the Isthmian canal.
A* soon as the proclamation was signed
it was returned to the State Depart
ment, where the exchange of ratifica
tions had taken place between Secre
tary of State Hay and Minister Bunau-
Varilla of Panama. The Cabinet was
in session when the proclamation
reached the White House from the
F;ate Department. Secretary Loeb
took the document to the President
and he cigned it immediately.
The President may not j^nd to the
Sonate his appointments on the Isth
mian Canal Commission before the flrst
Ot next week. He has been informed
by telegraph that Benjamin M. Harrod
of New Orleans has mailed to him e
statement regarding the charges
against Harrod. Tntil he hasÂ» received
this statement and given it consider
ation, the probability is that the offi
cial announcement of the personnel of
the commission will be withheld.
The exchange of ratifications between
Secretary Hay and Minister Bunau-
Varilla marks the close of diplomatic
negotiations looking: to the acquirement
by the United States of canal rights on
the isthmus, running back to the first
quarter of the last century. What re
mains to be done now is nothing more
than the adjustment of certain legal
questions by the lav.- officers of thuÂ»
Government. The State Department
has fulfilled its functions. The legal
iiucstions remaining to be settled are
the pending litigation In France con
cerning the canal and the question
whether under the terms of the Spooner
act the $10,000,000 which was to be paid
to Colombia can now be paid to Pan
ama.
It will be some time before these
questions can he settled, and meanwhile
no money is likely to pass. â¢ '
The proclamation is as follows:

Minister from Panama to the Presi
dent of the republic in the following
dispatch: < 'j.'-'^*"-.
The exchange of ratifications of treaty has
taken j>lace to-day at H>:t5. thus flnirhins the
accomplishment of my duty to the republic of
I'fcnama. I mjuei't your Excellency, in con
formity with what I have evpresifcl in my let
ter of November 24 to the Department of For
â¦â irn Affair*, to accept my rr*ij;natlon Â»rom
to-day and to send me by next tnall my Setter
of r*Â»call.
M. Bunau-Varilla expects to remain
in this country- for a fortnight and will
then go to Paris to look after private
business. It is possible the Panama
Government will wish M. Bunau-Va
rilla to remain in charge of the lega
tion until his successor. Dr. Arose
mena, arrives, and If possible the Min
ister will consent to extend his mis
eion.
Replying to" an- inquiry why the
Panama Government was not to re
t-pive to-day, in accordance with the
terms of the treaty, the $10,000,000
which this country has pledged to pay.
the "tinister eaid:
For two reason*. First, becaute I had in
formed the offlcials that were a check for
Ibis amount bonded me 1 should be co:r.!*>lled
to return it, because I have *ald *ll aicnj;
that I did not care to be connected In any
way with the financial dealings aritlng from
the canal sale, and further, J>icauÂ«-r the Gov
ernment of Panama has not ye*, decided on the
programme for th* investment -.of this 6um.
and therefore would prefer that It should net
bÂ« transferred for the present.
A M-c-ond reason is the necessity of accom
plishing certain legal formalities with the
Panama Canal. Company which the Attorney
General of the l.'&ited 8tateÂ« thinks siiculd be
eettled before the payment of â¢ the purchase
;Tirx. J-r this rcSKon fie tirefertuce ot Uie
Panama Government that the money be held
Jn trukt here for the present is in harmony
viili the withes cf this Government.
Asked about the nature of the for
malities. Bunau-Varllla said:
These formalities arise from the special situ
ation Bt the canal projierty which is now In
the hands of a receiver and cannot be trans
rniltnl without aittnorlzatlun of the courts.
The abtsurd theory of Colombia that certain
parts of th* oontrnc-t between Columbia and
Panama are ctlll binding while others are not
can cause only amusement even to the simple
Colombia has lost her sovereignty over .the
Panama, canal and therefore Is unable to ful
fill her obligations to the Panama Canal Com.
pany. although Colombia . seerat desirous that
the Panama Canal Company shall fuinjl Us
obligations to the Bogota Government and
decline to **11 tbe canal without the consent
of -Colombia.
I Â«bould say that probably not more than a
month â will elapw before Panama will be
ready to accept this $10,000,000.
The Minister to-day received forijjal
notification from " the Korean Govern
ment that Korefi. had â¢ recognized the

Memorial Services Are
Held on Birthday
of Le Conte.
BERKELEY. Feb. 26. â Memorial
per\'ices in honor of those that have
passed away within the year were held
this morning at the University of Cali
fornia] Many people gathered in Har
mon gymnasium to hear words of love
and respect for friends and loved ones
that have answered the call of the
reaper. - Â». .
This day waB set apart to honor the
memory of tbo late. Joseph Le Conte
and the occasion was all the more im
pressing because there had died within
the year three men who were his
friends and associates^ â Professor Mar
tin Kellogg, Louis Du Pont Syle and
Felicien Paget. These men's lives and
works were touchingly referred to in
the services by Professor William
Carey Jones, himself their friend and
aspociaf e. * > c 'â¢ ,.--Â»"Â».;--'
Max Thelen, president of the As
sociated Students, presided over the
meeting, which began with an invoca
tion by the Rev. J. K. McLean, presi
dent of the Pacific Theological Semi

students that have died since the last
memorial (lay was ;then read by Air.

senior; Valentine Law, sophomore.
In his memorial address Professor
Jones referred to the significance of
the day and then devoted himself to
a review of the lives of his departed
friends, saying in part:
The significance of the dÂ»y you have chostn
for relijghtlng; the fire on our university's
tacred hearth, ot* commemorating the purln?a
members of our community, is that it is the
birthday of Joreiih IÂ«* Conte. In selecting
thip day you have given evidence of a beauti
lut instinct of our nature. In the lifetime
cf l*rofe?sor LÂ» Conte it was a day of rÂ»r-

was still with us.

OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â The Board of

this afternoon to a discussion of meth
ods for increasing the effectiveness of

sion was general and no definite course
of action was decided upon.
"Reports had reached our ears," said
President McElroy after the meeting,
"touching alleged lack of efficiency in
the Police Department. No definite ac
cusations have been, made, but the
members of the board felt in duty
bound to ascertain, if possible, what

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 190 i.
CAREY DENIES
HE WAS FALSE
Wealthy Manxman Says Chi
cago Trapeze Performer
Deserves None of His Coin
ANSWERS DAMAGE SUIT
Claims He Never Proposed
to Leona Bonne, and Her
Pretensions Are False
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
flll8 Broadway, Feb. 26.
To the charge made by Leon.a
Bonne, a Chicago trapeze performer,'
against William L. D. Carey, the j
wealthy Manxman, that lie . propsed
marriage to her in 1901 and then mar
ried another, the defendant to-day en
tered a general denial.
A few days ago Miss Bonne began
a suit for $100,000 damages, which
she asked as balm for her bliRhted af
fections and compensation for the
wrong done her. Not having any |
knowledge to the contrary, Carey as
serts for all he knows that, she is a
married woman. He denies that he
deceived her or induced the fair per- i
former on the bars to promise to mar- |
ry him.
Carey in his answer'admits that he
was a married man during a part of
the time he knew her, but says that
he was divorced in Chicago on March
4, 1901.. He denies that/Miss Bonne
confided in his alleged promise to
marry her and having no knowledge
on the subject denies that she has re
mained sole and unmarried or that
she would now be ready and willing
to marry him were he not already
married to another.
Carey admits that he has some
means, but modesty constrains him
from admitting that he worth as much
as a quarter of a million dollars, as
alleged in the complaint, and says
his fortune does not exceed $100,000.
He asserts, however, that the plain
tiff has not been damaged in the
slightest by her association or lack of
association with him and that she is
not entitled to any of his money, and
as a clincher pleads that all of her
claims are barred by the statute of
limitations. #

SAVES $1000
BY MARRYING
Repudiates Husband After
Marriage to Avert a
Breach of Promise Suit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Feb. 26.â Mrs. Glacinta
Grassi, a comely/Italian widow, who
recently married Michele, Grassi, her
forothtr-in-law, to quash a $1000 breach
of promise- suit, has repudiated her
marriage and l?ft her husband. Grassi
now declares that the widow jobbed
him by getting him to marry her after
he brought his suit. By this means she
saved all expense of a suit and prob
ably $1000.
Mrs. Graesi had been a widow about
a year. Her husband left her a nice
little fortune. A- few months ago she
wrote to Michele Grassi, a brother of
her deceased husband, telling him that
if he came to California she would
marry him. Grassi disposed of "every
thing he had and came to California.
When he arrived here he had no money,
and then Mrs. Grassi refused to marry
him. He then brought suit for breach
of promise and $1000 damages. Finally
she repented and married him to quash
the suit.
Grassi now declares he has only a
wife In name and that she has refused
to live with him. After the ceremony
the couple took . a honeymoon trip to
Oxhard.* They were having a delightful
time until one day Mrs. Grassi excused
herself, saying" she was going out to sell
a lot. From that moment he has not
seen ' his ', wife and . sh6 refuses to live
with him.. Grassi declares he was alone
in a strange place tfnd could speak but
little English, and" he was obliged ' ta
sell his coat : and other personal effects
in <*der to buy.' a ; ticket to this place.
He will now seek to have his breach of
promise suit* renewed, as he declares he
has been" tricked. â¢ '

broken telephone wire that had fallen
across the trolley wire at Seventeenth
and Bryant streets. As it was two
valuable horses were killed Instantly,
and before the grounding apparatus
could be got into use the harness was
badly burnt. Fortunately the broken
wire did not touch any of the crew cf
the truck, for the current was strong
enough to melt the brass end of the
grounding device and it would ha\e
given short shrift to any man with
whom it came in contact.
The truck had been called out from
its house on Seventeenth street, near
Folsom, by an alarm 'of fire from box
23S at Sixteenth street and Potrero ave
nue, and as it was turning into Bryant
street the hanging wire was struck in
the dark. One of the horses was caughc
by It under hia neck and fell dead with
out a sound. The second horse was
also touched by the wire, but lived for
a few seconds, making the neighbor
hood resound with his fearful cries.
The third horse was severely shocked,
but was returned to the stable without
any visible marks of injury.
Captain "William Carew, in charge vZ
the truck, at once jumped to the
ground on discovering the trouble with
the' horses and got his grounding ap
paratus In place. This â  stopped the
current for a short time and enabled
the men to get the truck away from
the dead horses. The driver of th<*
truck, Charles Thoney, and the other
members of the crew. Lieutenant de
Meyer, Tillerman Walter Nichols anJ
Truckman M. "Wright, had great diffi
culty in preventing the live wire from
damaging the truck as well as killing
themselves, and but for the grounding
device loss of life probably would have
resulted.
"While on the way to a fire from box
2C5 yesterday forenoon a fire engini
collided with a wagon at the crossing
of Mission and Fremont streets. The
wagon was knocked into kindling wood.
Th? man in charge of the vehicle. Bl
Richard, was hurled from his seat, re
ceiving several lacerations on the head
and face.
Car No. 43 of the Sutter street line
collided at 6:20 p. m. yesterday with
two heavily laden lumber wagons at
the corner of Hyde and Sutter streetr..
The wagons were tandem with four
horses and were seen by the gripman
coming down the Hyde street hill. He
rang a warning bell, but the driver
paid no attention and attempted la
cross ahead of the car. The dummy
crashed into one of the wagons. The
dashboard and headlight of the dummy
were smashed and bent Inward, injur
ing Mose Hamburger, a passenger.

NOTABLES TALK
OF THE FUTURE
Prominent Men Sing State's
Praise at Banquet of Stock
ton's Chamber of Commerce
THE GOVERNOR SPEAKS
The Toast, "California," Is
Responded To in Eloquent
Force by State's Executive
Spec!*] Dlf ratch to TbÂ» Call.
STOCKTON. Feb. 26. â The third
annual banquet of the Stockton
Chamber of Commerce took place this
evening in Masonic Hall and it proved
to be a success from every viewpoint.
Covers were laid for 400, and when
Toastmaster Arthur H. Ashley called
for order at S:30 most of the ticket
holders were in their places. The In
clement weather failed to put the
slightest damper on the affair. Gov
ernor George C. Pardee was an hon
ored gruest and Rufus P. Jennings
came in for cloae attention when he
spoke to his toast The boom spirit
was In evidence even on the pro
gramme and menu, one page of which
set forth in terse form an outline of
the work accomplished since the last
gathering of the members and their
friends.
It may be stated that the secre
tary's report to-night showed a mem
bership of 4 90. The large company
did ample Justice to the menu and
were in excellent humor when the
speaking began, shortly after 9
o'clock. Secretary Colvin Brown re
viewed the last year's work in a short
nddrees and was followed by De Witt
Clary, who gave an eloquent portrayal
of the future possibilities of this sec
tion.
THE GOVERNOR'S SPEECH.
The speech of the evening was by
Governor Pardee. who was in a happy
vein and as he warmed to his subject.
"California," his intense spirit touched
the chords of eloquence and evoked
the hearty applause of his enthusias
tic auditors. The Governor said irt
part:
I come to you to-nicht to Â«>xt*nd the hand
of hÂ»*arty fellowship; to rejoice with you tÂ° r
what has already been accomplished for the
upbuilding of this mafnlflcent section and
to Join with you in mapping out lines on
which future conquests will be successfully
fought. V.'e of California stand on the thres
hoM of fcreat thin(rc Nearly 300 years agro
Hishop Berkeley Rave utterance to the great
truism that "Westward the course of empire
tÂ«kÂ»s its way." The scepter of power and
(rreÂ»tneÂ»<Â« hud centuries before passed from
Haliylon to Egypt, from Egypt to Greece, from
Greece to Rome, from Rome to Madrid and
Amsterdam, thence to England and now, fol
lowing the course r>f empire, it ha* come to
America, resting now on the Atlantic, but
soon to ccme to the shores of the Pacific,
where it may look out toward the distant
lands where one-half of the people in the
world are soon to be touched by the magic
hand of civilization. To us ere long the
scepter i>f power must come. Upon this mag
nificent Fiate 800 miles long and 25<> miles
wide, with its millions of acres of fertile soil,
overcast by a climate as fair as that of Italy,
with counties as large as some Eastern State*
and resources of infinite magnitude, will fall
the leadership of our great land.
It has been Raid. "Go to Naples and die."
1 will give better advice oy saying. "Come
to California and live." I-*t the homeseeker
make his domicile here, where he may have
no tear of winter's storms or of summer's
heat; where sky and soil and all nature con
spile to make every minute of life mean com
fort and happiness. I>"t the homeseeker come
here, where he can work every month in the
year and experience the real joys of living. I
fancy 1 ha\e seen some of the world,-: but in
all its broad expanse there is no spot so good,
e<> dear, so glorious as California.
CALIFORNIA AN EMPIRE.
Thry *ay California is young, yet over there
in the Sierras stand those magnificent trees,
Filent watchers over the rise and fail of na
tions, trees that were aged by centuries when
Moses livtd und when the pyramids were
raised by the slaves of Egypt. Magnificence
and magnitude If found in (he Tosemite. Our
mountains are covered with glorious timbers
and filled with precious metals. Our valleys
are empires: here, the Han Joaquin, 600 miles
long from Reading to Bakersfield and capable
of supporting JO.OOo.OuO population. Our moun
tain streams contain the elements of cheap
power and our oil wells are still farther solv
ing tho problem. The State is awakening to
her magnificent possibilities. It stands to-day
in an attitude of preparation for the very near
day when the star of empire shall rest upon it.
Rufus P. Jennings followed the
Governor, making some remarks very
complimentary to the chamber in re
sponse to the toast, "Stockton's Place
Among the State's Promoters." To
Hon. James A. Louttit fell the closing
toast, "The Ladies."
Governor Pardee arrived here early
to-day and spent some time in an in
spection of the State asylum and later
visited the Chamber of Commerce,
where he remained some time.

The Pacific Coast representatives of
the National Trotting Association sat
as a board of review last night at the
Palace Hotel and considered the case
of Driver Charle> Durfee and the mare
Sweet Marie. They were ruled off

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1904.
DEATH CALLS
HIM AS LIFE'S
WORK BEGINS
SON OF OAKLAND EDITOR
WHO PASSED AWAY YES
TERDAY MORNING.
William E. Dargie Jr.
Passes Away at His
Oakland Home.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26. â "William E.
Dargie Jr., the only son of William E.
Dargie, proprietor of the Oakland
Tribune and one of the best known
editors in the State, died at his home,
on Lake Shore avenue, this morning
about 9 o'clock. While his death was
not unexpected, it came as a great
shock to his many friends and family.
The young man had been failing for
nearly a year; but, despite his weak
ness, there was always the 'lingering
hope that the winter might be survived
and that with spring would come re
covery.
The passing of the young man was
particularly sad, for he had only cele
brated his twenty-first birthday anni
versary on December 27 last, and he
had just stopped over the threshold
into manhood.
The young man was born in Oakland
and was educated in the schools of this
city. He was a graduate of Miss Hor
ton's private school and of Boone's
Academy, in Berkeley, and was Just
preparing to enter the University of
California to complete his education
when death called him. In his studies
he showed remarkable abilty and won
the highest credits.
In the interval between his graduation
from the Oakland private school and
his entrance into Boone's Academy he
was assistant secretary of the Califor
nia Paris World's Fair Commission.
Though a young man, scarcely more
than a boy, young Dargie showed rare
tact and' ability. Already popular, he
made for himself many additional
friends among the visitors to the ex
position, to whom he showed the great
est courtesy and kindness.
. The death of the young man is a
great blow to his parents, who were de
voted to him, and to a large circle of
friends in all parts of the State.
The funeral probably will be held on
Monday.
JOHN' MOYXAHAX IS DEAD.
Discoverer of Celebrities Passes Away
in Kansas City.
KANSAS CITY. Mo., Feb. 26. â Colo
nel John Moynahan, actor, manager
and discoverer of theatrical celebri
ties, is dead. Moynahan originated
the idea of putting prize fighters on
the stage. With Pat Sheedy to back
the enterprises, he managed John L.
Sullivan when the latter was in his
prime. He discovered Mclntyre and
Heath, who are now making great
hits in vaudeville, when they were
stags hands and put them before au
diences. He was the only man who
ever introduced a prize fighter to the
President of the United States. Under
his guidance Sullivan met Grover
Cleveland and Mrs. Cleveland in the
Blue Room of the White House short
ly after the President's marriage.
Colonel Moynahan died at the City-
Hospital after a brief illness of ery
sypelas. Many of his friends did not
even know that he was ill. In Omaha
fifteen years ago he and his- brother
Andy were political forces who al
most, if not entirely, ruled the town.
There it was that he met Bryan, then
in obscurity, and nominated him for
the first office to which the Nebraskan
was ever elected.
M. \V. UTTLEFIELD IS DEAD.

WARDRIP PAYS
THE PENALTY
Sacramento Murderer and
Burglar Dies Gamely on
the Scaffold at San Quentin
EXECUTION A SUCCESS
Within Three Minutes After
Condemned Man Left Death
Chamber He Was Dead
SAN QUENTIN, Feb. 26.â Charles
Wardrip was hanged this morning in
the prison execution chamber. Only
about thirty spectators were present.
The execution was one of the most sat
isfactory ever undertaken here. Just
three minutes elapsed from the time the
guards strapped Wardip in the death
chamber until the dropped. The pro
cession left the death chamber at 10:35
o'clock, and at 10:38 the trap was
dropped. Wardrip fell five feet eight
inches. At 10:39:45 Dr. P. F. Casey pro
nounced j life extinct. The neck was
broken in the fall, but it was some
minutes before the heart stopped. "War
drip was anxious to . meet de'ath and
was game to the last. He mounted the
scaffold unassisted. Night Guards Mer
ritt and Chiles marched on either side
of him. As he reached the trap he
gazed down upon the spectators and
then up at the dangling noose and
smiled. He said nothing, however.
Hangman Arbogast adjusted the noose,
the sign was given by Warden Tomp
kins and the prisoner expiated his
crime.
"Wardrip was taken into the death
chamber last Saturday night. Since his
incarceration he 'has talked very little.
Yesterday when- Warden Tompkins
asked him if he wished to waive the
reading of the death warrant, he re
plied that he wanted all that was com
ing to him. This morning Wardrip told
Captain Swan he was anxious to have
It ajl over with.
P. H. Duffy, brother of the murdered
man, was present to-day and was much
affected by the execution. Just after
the drop Duffy fainted and had to be
carried out of the room.
To-day the second one in the Ward
rip family died upon the scaffold. The
first was a brother, who was executed
several years ago in a Kentucky
prison. The Wardrips originally came
from Kentucky. Â£ven though Ward
rip had many bad characteristics and
was indifferent to his own fate, yet he
evinced a noble trait in shielding a
friend from harm. With his death
also goes a secret and that was con
cerning one who was his accomplice
in crime.
Two years has elapsed and every ef
fort has been made to require him to
divulge the name of the accessory, but
the identity of the criminal is un
known. Wardrip went to his death
with his lips sealed. Just before the
condemned man entered the execution
chamber he told one of the prison at
taches, "I killed Duffy to save the
Kid. They neverlfound out who the
'Kid* was. I never would tell. . In "a
few minutes I die. The secret goes
with me."
On March 17. 1902. when the crime
was committed, a young boy acted as
lookout for Wardrip while he broke
into the Bartel home in Sacramento.
When Duffy approached the "Kid"
warned the burglar. Duffy entered
the residence and was killed. Later
Wardrip, in speaking of his crime,
stated that he had to^kill Duffy or the
"Kid" would be known, and he had
promised the lad that, come what
may, he would protect him. Suspicion
rested upon the son of one 1 of Sacra
mento's most wealthy citizens, but no
tangible evidence could be procured
and no arrest . was made. Wardrip
would not tell and the police have
never found out.

GOLFERS ROOTED
BY CAVALRYMEN
Grassy Links at Presidio
Are Eipped Up by Uncle
Sam's Prancing Troopers
WILL SEEK NEW FIELDS
Club Members Hope to Find
Recreation Ground in Vi
cinity of Ingleside Track
There Is sadness in the heart of thÂ«
San Francisco golfer to-day. The link*
so dear to his eye have been ruthlessly
trod upon by ; the . iron-shod hoof*
of the steeds of war. Hazards havÂ«
been made there that all the steam
rolling machines in the country could
not efface. . â¢
The beautiful grounds on the PrÂ«
sidio Heights that have been such a
source of joy and keen delight to the
golfer are now a thing of the past.
The ground is still there, but that
clean-cut, smooth sward of Kentucky
blue grass is now so full of deep laid
furrows and haphazard hazards that
the bunkers pale into insignificance be
side them.
And all this has been occasioned by
the prancing and caperings of. Uncle
yarn's sturdy warhorses. For ! some
time past it has been evident that the
grounds must be utilized for drilling
purposes, but the members of the golf
club hardly expected that the Govern
ment would take the initiative so soon
and order the annual Inspection of the
troopers, which took place yesterday,
held' upon their sacred grounds.
They were greatly distressed last
night when they saw the condition the
links were in. Coach Robert Johnstone
stated that it would be utterly impos
sible to play any kind of a game on
them in the condition they are In now,
and he added it would cost a lot of
money to put them in proper shape
again.
. The value of the property on which
the clubhouse stands has greatly en
hanced since it was purchased, and
this will in a measure compensate for
the loss on the outlay in fixing up the
links.
The club has in a measure. somewhat
prepared itself for such a contingency,
and it Is rumored it has already made
negotiations for the Lake Merced
Tract of the Spring Valley Water
Works, near Ingleside.

<CoryiiÂ£ht. 1904, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
"Self-preservation is the first law of
nature," and in the workings of the
human body this invariable tendency
to self-preservation initiates and dom
inates every one of the body's myriad
activities. A cough, for instance, is
merely a blast of air forcibly expelled
from the lungs for the purpose of dis
lodging either an accumulation of
mucus or some foreign body that has
found it.^ way into the upper air pass
ages.
Now, a cough seems a very trifling
act. but were it not for the cough
which carries out with it the mucus
or the foreign substance, the result
would be grave injury to the body, if
rot death. It sometimes happens that
through injury the nervous path from
brain to lungs is broken, or the nerves
leading from lungs to brain may cease
to acU In such a case either the for
eign substance is not discovered or if
discovered there is inability to cough
It away. This condition always ends
fatally. Secretions and foreign sub-
Btanees which enter the lungs or air
passages accumulate until the func
tions of the lungs are destroyed either
by being clogged up or by inflamma
tion. It has happened that a man at
tempting suicide by cutting his throat
has made the mistake of cutting too
high up under the jaw and has suc
ceeded only in dividing two of the
nerve? leading to the lungs. A man in
this condition will live for several
days. He will finally die of suffocation
or of lung inflammation due to for
eign matter.
Rut how, it will be asked, can a
yawn or a sigh be considered as a
means of self-preservation, that is of
giving better conditions for life and
health ? Let us <onsid<*r first a yawn.
We know that in sle^p or in a state,
of drowsiness ail the vital operations
flow down. The heart beats more
slowly, the lungs take in less oxygen,
the blood settles around the internal
organs, while the stomach, liver and
other members all do less work than
would be required for ordinary active
waking life. Now if, after a period
of such drowsiness, or of sleep, the
person rouses himself even to a slight
degree instantly the're is an aded de
mand for energy. To support this en
ergy the body needs" more oxygen and
more blood. How can this be ob
tained most quickly? Why by a deep,
full and slow inspiration and at the
same time by such a stretching of all
the muscles, arms. legs, trunk, neck,
even of the jaws, that the blood shall
be drawn from its comparative stag
nation around the internal organs to
the muscles. 80, among all the higher
mammals, as well as among children
and people of primitive habits, the
yawn and the stretch are instinctive
acts leading to relief from that vital
slowing down' which accompanies
sleep or drowsiness.
Now, the sigh in some respects re
sembles the yawn. When one concen
trates the mind firmly on some problem
there is more or less tension of all the
muscles. If the situation involves un
pleasantness or worry there is gener
ally motion of some kind â drumming
with the fingers, fumbling or other
movements. Body, then, as well as
mind, is extremely active. But if the
mind, instead of being concentrated, is
merely contemplative, as in reverie
thinking of one leved or of one dead or
of any other great joy or griefâ then
there is quite a different state of the
muscular system. The muscles of the
limbs are not tensed, and there is little
or no disturbance of the circulation.
There is, however, in all contemplation,
reverie, grief, sadness or meditation a
tendency to fixation of the muscles of
the chestâ that is. to hold the breath.
The writer has observed a woman deep
ly immersed in grief over the death of
a child who in the course of one min
ute stopped breathing twice, once for
twelve and once for eight seconds.
Then she sighed heavily. Why the sigh?
Because the holding of the breath
meant a diminution in the supply of
oxygen, which after a time caused op
pression and distress. The sigh was sim
ply a long. deep, effortless breath, the
object of which was to make up for
the deficient breathing of reverie or
contemplation.
Snoring and hiccoughing often give
rise to questions as to their causes. The
former of these, snoring, usually occurs
during sleep. The sound is produced
by the flapping together of the soft
tissues of the throat. The soft palate
must have fallen back so as to nearly
or quite close the posterior nasal ori
fices which lead from the nostrils into
the throat. At the same time the base
of the tongue must have fallen back so
as to leave only a small opening between
itself and the soft palate above. Under
these circumstances the air passing
back and forth causes a flapping mo
tion of these pendulous soft parts, and
this produces the snore. A very slight
change of movement will cause a shift
ing of the structures and a stoppage or
alteration of the sound. The so-called
"death rattle," a peculiar sound fre
quently heard just before death, Is
merely a modification of the snore. The
"death rattle." like the snore, is caused
by the flapping of the soft structures
in the throat. The greater relaxation,
however, due to muscular weakness,
and the quickened, shallow breathing
jrive to the sound emitted a 6h*arper,
quicker quality.
Closely allied to the snore and the
"death rattle" is the groan. The groan
differs from the snore in the fact that
under the influence of pain there is pro
duced a more general muscular effort,
and that the vocal cords are Involved.
Like the snore, the groan is made with
full inhalations and exhalations of
the breath. sV ; ";
Hiccough Is merely a nervous spas
modic contraction of. the diaphragm,
which passes downward so suddenly
and violently as to cause a quick, in
voluntary intake ot breath. Hiccough,
like tremor, chill or other nervous
twitching, may result from any one of
a variety of conditions. Exhaustion,
excitement, overfeeding, alcoholic stim
ulation or exposure to cold may lead to
hiccough. Although usually a disturb
ance of little moment, hiccough is occa
sionally so prolonged .that through fa
tigue and fright serious consequences
may ensue. Usually, however, a hold
ing of the breath for a few moments
will result In a cessation of the hic
cough. In severe cases the administra
tion of an- anesthetic is sometimes
necessary.
"About Asbestos.
BY MALCOLM McDOWELL.
(Author â¢'ShoD Talk on Wonders of the
Crafts.")
(Copyright, 1804, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Asbestos, one of the most wonderful
of substances dug out of the earth, has
been much In the public eye since the
Iroquois Theater disaster. Now, It is
reported, the bulk of the world's sup
ply for many years to come has been
secured by the Standard Oil Interests
for the purpose of making fireproof
"timber" and tunnel sheathing.
The supply of asbestos is limited.
Most of it comes from Canada, and it
is found in Oregon, Idaho, California
and other Western States. It also is
mined In the Italian Alps, whence
most of the supply came before it was
discovered in Canada. But, except in
the later country, the veins of the
greasy-feeling, silky-like fibrous stuff
are too thin to be worked with profit,
for the problem of mining asbestos is
found in the disposition of the foreign
matter in which the asbestos is en
tombed. In the Canadian mines only
about 4 per cent of the material quar
ried is asbestos; the rest is made up of
rock and other refuse.
Asbesrtos occurs In veins, varying
from half an inch to four Inches thick,
between layers of hornblende crystals.
The longer, tougher fibers are found in
the deepest diggings; the less valuable
asbestos â that is, the short, easily pul
verized fibers â are found near the sur
face. The mining is much like rock
quarrying. Holes are drilled and
dynamite exploded to blast out a layer,
which falls to the floor of the work
ing. The workmen break out as much
of the pure asbestos in as large lumps
as possible, load the lumps into tubs
or skips and send it to the surface,
where boys and young men "cob" or
crumble the rock away from the as
bestos.
The lumps of asbestos are packed in
rough bales and shipped to this coun
try to be manufactured Into the fin
ished product. The asbestos as It
comes from the mine is of a yellowish
or greenish color, the edges furred
with loose fiber. The best grades of
asbestos are white, and the fiber is
long enough to be carded and spun
into yarn and then woven Into a
greasy-feeling, dirty white cloth,
which is fireproof, acid proof and
weather proof.
When the lumps of raw asbestos
reach the factory they are placed into
machines, which crush them until the
fibers are loosened into fluffy, cottony
masses. From the crushing mill the
fibers pass Into another machine which
separates the long and short fibers and
at the same time throws out any stones
or other refuse matter. The short fibers
are ground up into a pulp or powder,
according to the use for which they are
intended, while the longer fibers are
gathered together to be woven into
cloth.
It is this cloth which is used for mak
ing fireproof drop curtains for thea
ters. The asbestos yarn also is made
into gloves and mittens for glass and
iron workers and a finer cloth is woven
for acid filters. To catalogue the uses
of asbestos would be a long task, for
within twenty years i\a applications
have multiplied so rapidly that- it now
can be regarded as one of the most
versatile of manufactured products.
Combined with colors and oils It makes
a paint which makes anything it coats
either fireproof or nearly so. Asbes
tos, combined with canvas, felt or like
material, makes an excellent roofing
or ceiling material, and the roofs of
many factories, warehouses, docks and
like structures are covered with asbes
tos treated material. Wood pulp or
other substances which can carry the
asbestos is used for covering steam
pipes.
"Mineral wool" is the nearest thing
to asbestos which man has been able
to make on a commercial scale. As
first it was made from slag, the refuse
from blast furnaces, but the "wool"
was too brittle and melted at too low
a . temperature to i be used as a sub
stitute for asbestos. Metallurgists took
the* matter in hand, analyzed asbestos,
and made up the proper mixture from
sand, fire clay, limestone, kaolin and
iron slag to give a product which pos
sessed many of the characteristics of
asbestos. Now limestone, broken glass,
broken dishes, iron slag and pieces of
fire brick 'are melted down in a suit
able furnace and blown into the fibrous
stuff called "mineral wool/'
When the mixture Is melted into a
liquid by the intense heat of the fur
nace a small opening is made and the
molten stuff escapes In a stream about
an inch in diameter. As it falls' a jet
of steam or compressed air, issuing
from flat - nozzles, is turned on to it
and blows it, a fine spray, through a
window into an adjoining room. The
action of the Jets upon the stream of
molten sand, iron, clay and glass spins
it out into beautiful white fibers, which
on cooling look like washed wool. This
material is used largely as a non-con
ductor of heat. It is packed around
steam pipes and boilers to retain heat
and packed around refrigerators to re
tain the oold. It also is used for "fire
proofing" buildings and for "deadening"
walls and floors, but compared with as
bestos its uses are limited.

JUVENILE INCORRIGIBLES.
JUDGE LINDSEY of the Juvenile Court of Den
ver attended the recent meeting of the Charities
and Corrections of this State, and delivered
several 'addresses that were of great interest. He de
veloped and enforced the necessity for such courts as
that over which he presides, for the number of juvenile
incorrigibles has so increased in the last fifteen years
as to present a most afflicting problem.
In cities like Chicago and New York the arrests of boys
aged between 16 and 20 years run into the tens of thou
sands every year. So the juvenile courts are created by
law, to deal only and specially with that class of offend
ers. Of the necessity for such courts there is no doubt,
but what of the cause back. of it^all? From the record
it appears that we have reached a condition in this
country when it is not only a misfortune to parents to
have children, but it is a menace to society and the State.
In one of his addresses Judge Lindsey indicated part
of his duty to be finding "jobs" for the boys who are
brought before him, work being the best means of re
form. Does not this open the door to the cause of it all?
Much blame is put ,upon parents, but how # can they
combat the results of idleness, for which they are
powerless to find a remedy? The world is familiar with
the vital subject of child labor. Let it know also that
child idleness is a burning question.. At the age of'thir
teen children, and especially boys, begin to feel the
promptings of ambition and activity. They want to
imitate men. Given the chance to â¢ imitate the right
things that men do, the useful work they see going on
around them, and they will do it. But deny them this
opportunity and it is perfectly sure that they will, imme
diately begin to imitate the wrong things that men do,
and will as readily pick up the adult vices as under hap
pier conditions they would the adult virtues.
Whenever the experiment of sending boys into the
country to work on farms has been tried it has proved
a successful means of turning them in the right path,
provided they are properly treated and trained. The
difficulty does not exist solely in the slums of great
cities. It is a moral disease in the communities that
are not in the slums. An inspection of the records oi
State reform schools shows that a large percentage of
juvenile incorrigibles, subjected to their treatment and
control, come from families in which the difficulty can
be accounted for only by the idleness of boys of from
14 years to 20. Now in the various industries and occu
pations gainful in their nature and necessary to com
munity life, there is room for the employment of such
youth. Judge Lindsey says that he has tfecn greatly
assisted by such business men as could find jobs for
boys. Finding jobs is of temporary assistance, but lacks
the value* that is in definite training, with a definite pur
pose in the acquisition of skill that is to be applied for
permanent self-supporting purposes.
We have expressed the opinion that much help is to
be found in the training in -handicrafts that is to be
furnished in the polytechnic or trade schools. In them
boys have the opportunity to become finished and skilled
handicraftsmen, and to acquire knowledge that equips
them for self-support and the duties of good citizenship.
It will be finally found to be the policy of the States
to amend the penal or reform features out' of their re
form school policy and turn all of their reform schools
into shops for teaching the handicrafts, to which boys
will be sent, not under semi-penal sentence, but in a fixed
apprenticeship.
As the evil of juvenile transgression \ spreads, it is
taken too much as a matter of course by the community.
There is too much-indifference to its causes, and too
little attention to the profound social disease of which
it is the mere symptom. Treating symptoms cures
nothing. One might as well try to prevent an eruption
of Vesuvius by putting a bread and milk poultice on the
crater as to cure such an alarming social disease by
dealing with its disturbing symptoms only.
The extent of the evil may be estimated by reading
the daily press of any large city and noting that a vast
majority of the crimes reported therein are committed
by boys and men under 20 years of age. It is useless
to rage at parents. Few of them want. it so, but they
cannot be held to answer for the causes which lie be
yond them, in the restrictions and limitations to which
society assents. The State owes to parents the duty
of supporting domestic discipline by removing restric
tions upon opportunity for the young.
Finally, the moral disease under discussion increases
with the tendency to abandon rural for urban life. Con
tact with the soil and skill in the industries related to it
offer ideal conditions. Always when the race has been
enervated and morally broken' down in dense popula
tions it has risen to its feet by contact with the soil.
The lure of great cities should be put less prominently
before thf young, and the ideal life . of the country
should have its wholesome charms displayed instead.
The plot to destroy a Salt Lake theater, fortunately
discovered before human life was sacrificed, reveals the
existence of a spirit of diabolism almost incomprehensible
to the normal human brain. It is daily becoming more ap
parent that communities, in sheer protection, must de
vise new punishments to fit new crimes. In crime as
well .as in civilization we have that which would have
appalled the ancients.
SENTIMENT WORTHY OF ACCEPTANCE.
FROM the Springfield Republican, one of the leading
* editorial organs of Massachusetts, comes the lat
est strong plea for the passage through Congress
of the bill which will preserve for us one of the noblest
manifestations of nature in California? the Calaveras
grove of big trees. Says the Republican: "Only the
nation should be the possessor of these glorious surviv
ors of a geological antiquity. It is really absurd to think
of pigmy men, mere ants in stature beside them, having
the power to sweep them from the earth for a few dol
lars profit. The United States, which spends millions
and millions upon things that are of the- moment, can
well afford to spend a few thousand dollars to save such
treasures from so ignominious a fate."
When so strong an editorial Utterance comes from the
other side of the continent it is significant proof of the
interest which is taken in our venerable trees by the
whole nation â an interest which must express itself
strongly enough to make Congress ready to turn a will-'
ing ear to the petitions of those who would see the. giant
trees continue to watch over bur destinies as they once
guarded the good fortunes^of the man with the stone ax.
It is not a selfish claim which the people of California
advance for the big trees. We do not desire the preser
vation of the Calaveras giants as an advertisement to
hold out to tourists, nor as a boon to proprietors of sum-
mer resorts. It is a sentimental feeling, pure and simple,
that prompts our efforts.
Even in the workaday world there is room for more
ennobling influences than those of the mart and 'change.
One whose sentiments are not altogether corroded
must feel that living trees which have watched the ice
melt away from our continent, have seen volcanoes
cease their spouting and grow cool, and to whose lives
the coming of the white man to their feet has been only
â within the cycle of a few dropping cones, should be per
mitted to live xÂ»n to the fulfillment of their natural des
tinies. History records that the Colossus of Rhodes was
sold bit by bit for paltry pieces of silver until only the
memory of it remained. Let us hope that sentiment will
prevail over a hard materialism- in the matter of the
preservation of our giant trees, which are more majestic
ally wrought than any. monument of either ancient or
modern art.' . .
The Hague has decided that the powers which made
a show of force against Venezuela must receive prefer
ential treatment in the payment of the debts of the of
fending South American republic. However much we
may dislike this decision of the court of arbitration we
cannot but be pleased in the fact that it teaches Castro
a lesson even in the efficacy of force.
THE OLD STORY AGAIN.
A RECENT dispatch from Washington announces
that Senator Heyburn of Idaho has presented to
the army appropriation bill an amendment au
thorizing the Secretary of War to purchase a, tract of
land described in the report of General George M. Ran
dall, on May 13, 1902, situated partly in Spokane County,
Washington, and partly in Kootenai County, Idaho, com
prising 20,000 acres, to be used as a site for military
instruction and maneuvers. The amendment carries an
appropriation of $500,000.
The submission of this amendment is of direct interest
to California, because if it be carried and the purchase
be made, there will be an end to all prospect of having
a camp oi military instruction and maneuvers in Cali
fornia. Moreover the loss of the opportunity will
be due to ourselves alone, for the original proposition
was for the f staLiishment of a camp in this State, and
an army board recommended a site for it. No sooner
was the recommendation made, however, than the cus
tomary local opposition to local advancement broke
forth, and as a consequence there is now a fear we may
'lose the camp altogether.
At the time the question of a site in California was
under consideration three large tracts were offered. A
board of medical officers of the army investigated them â
one was rejected because it was without an-.adequate
water supply; another because it has near the center
of it a tewn of considerable size over which ' military
control could not be exercised; but the third site, known
as the T. H. Henry ranch, approved, a report of the
boird' addressed to the adjutant general at Washington
saying: "The ranch fills all the requirements for the
establishment of permanent camp grounds for the in
struction of large bodies of troops, inasmuch as it has
large area with diversified surface, r,oil draining quickly
after rain, sufficient timber for fuel and shelter, appro
priate climate, plentiful supply of pure water with natu
ral inclination lines for drainage and sewage."
Upon that showing we should get the camp. Differ
ences of opinion as to whether or not it is the best site
in California should give way in face of the fact that
it is the site that has been approved by the army board.
While we are wrangling the representatives Â«of other
States are at work. The Washington and Idaho dele
gations in Congress will, of course, stand together in
support of the amendment proposed by Senator Hey
burn, rnd if the representatives of California be divided
we shall lose the camp. The story is an old one, but let
us hope it will have a different ending from that of for
mer years, and that when the issue comes all Californians
will be found standing together for the interests of the
State.
The Iroquois Club, affectionately and familiarly known
as the Society of Old Squaws, has met, resolved and ad
journed in this city. Its meeting stirred the pulse of no
Democrat, its resolutions enlightened nobody else and
its adjournment came with no more agitation than a
ripple upon the political sea. The Democrat, nationally
considered, doesn't know where he came from, who he
is or where he is going.
THE NEW POTATO.
ONCE more under the magic touch of Luther Bur
bank the humble potato has jumped into the
public eye. He has made 'that esculent tuber to
diminish and to enlarge, to blanch and to blush,
until it has come out in a new dress of such a char
acter as to make recognition by its plebeian ancestors
impossible. He has crossed and crisscrossed the clumsy
tuber until finally it is said to be materially increased in
size and that its substance is delicately sweet and pos
sesses color of the warmth of auburn tresses. From
the homely "spud" in its wild, untamed state, buried
with its eyes full of dust in the Andes Mountains, where
it justified the ignominious name "small potatoes," it
has at last come into its own and is worthy its title of
Solanum tuberosum. Tn the past its virtues have been
many. From food to drink â for in some countries spirits
are brewed from it â from starch to stew, it has stuck
to us and rounded out our beings, and now who may
predict its possibilities? The clinging pea and the
pendent bean may lift their heads' with hope, the onion
rise up in its strength and the sour, wrinkled visage of
the pickle look pleasant, in anticipation of being brought
by the wand of this wizard of the vegetable kingdom to
the dignity of the navel orange, the seedless grape and
the new potato.
' Populism, that absurd development of American po
litical extravagance, has been executing another ghost
dance upon itself. The middle-of-the-roaders and the
fusionists, after intense squabbling, have agreed upon a
time and place to hold their national convention. To
most of,..us the properthing to do under the circum
stances is not to hold a convention but a funeral with
its necessary incident of speedy and decent burial.
Those very wise observers, the military critics, that
shed the light of their learning from a vantage point
several thousand miles away from the seat^'of
operations, say that the military organization of
Japan is better than that of any European, country.
When one thinks, of the Boer war the suspicion arises
that after all the decision. of the critics is no particular
compliment to the Mikado's tacticians.
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Worthy of Shyiock.
It was just after Theodore G. Cock
rill was elected Chief of Police in 1S73.
wlfen one morning after taking office
as he squatted down in his official
chair in the old City Hall Officer Blank,
then a bailiff in the Police Court, slip
ped in through a side door to congrat
ulate his new Chief on his victory and
the satisfaction it gave him to defeat
the enemy. Then he quietly approached
the Chief and, with the index finger
of hia right hand placed alongside his
nose, remarked: "Say, Chief, your
friends who are mine, recognizing the
great expense you have been at in win
ning this fight and knocking them
Crowley fellows, gives you this. Say
nothing about it; but keep mum."
Blank slipped out as quietly as he had
got in, closing the door after him.
Cockrlll was so taken by surprise
that he had no time to protest, but
placed the package, which contained
$500, in a drawer. Two days afterward
Blank again slipped in and with bated
breath Inquired if the Chief had men
tioned the transaction to any person.
The Chief responded in the negative.
"Just sign this by the way of a blind,"
said Blank, placing a note in front of
Cockrlll. The note was signed, and
nothing more was heard of it until the
Chief's term expired, when a collector
walked into his Front street liquor
store and presented the note for pay
ment, with Interest at 6 per cent. Cock
rill used language not found in good
society, but he had to pay the note,
which was assigned to the collector.
The sum and substance of it all was
that Blank held on to his graft in the
hall and cozened the Chief out of the
money that he thought was given him
by his friends.
Misplaced Charity.
With his clothing dripping from
rain and a sad and hungry look upon
his face, he walked Into the Emer
gency Hospital, holding a card from
Dr. Caro, recommending him to the
attention of the surgeon of the hos
pital.
On being asked what he wished he
briefly stated that he had been only
two weeks in the city and on this par
ticular day he was on his way to
Golden Gate Park to see Superin
tendent McLaren when, stepping? off a
car, something snapped in the back of
his head which took away all his
memory. He claimed to have had a
similar experience- six years previous
when he was confined in a lunatic
asylum in the East. At that time his
desire was to kill somebody. It made
no matter to him who the unfortunate
victim might be, as he lost all con
trol over himself. He feared a simi
lar desire might now seize him in
this, a strange city, and he did not
wish to kill an Innocent being.
A consultation held with Chief
Steward Bucher, who recommended
that the man be placed in a ward for
observation. This was done, his
clothing were dried and he was pro
vided with hot food and made com
fortable.
He remained in the hospital for
three days and when the rainstorm
passed off he got up and thanked the
attendants for their courtesy, re
marking as he walked out of the door
that he was dead broke, had no place
to sleep or money to purchase food
and as he was wet, cold and hungry
he had bluffed through the ruse of
lost memory in order to get shelter
and something to eat.
Paid in Trade.
"What's the matter, Judge?" asked
a newspaper man of Justice of the
Peace Lawson the other day. "You
seem to be out of sorts.**
"Well," retorted the Judge, "you
would also be out of sorts if you ran
up against some of the people I meet
in a day. Just listen to this for a tale
of woe. About an hour ago a man
and a woman came in here with a mar
riage license and asked me to marry
them. I tied the knot all right and
gave them the usual blessing. When
it was all over the groom shook hands
with me, thanked me and then told me
that he was a bricklayer and would
be pleased, in payment for my kind
ness, to come over to my house and
repafc- my chimney any time it need
ed it." -'â¢;;
r A Choral of the Year.
Hear, bubbling through gray morning
hours.
The trills of water-folk arise;
Their home in newly fallen showers.
Their notes as liquid as their skies.
The locust's whistling rigadoon
Shrills to the noon Usl sibilance.
To wake the woodlanJs from their
swoon
And set the weary air a-dance.
Leaves gasping from their breathless
chase
Follow the footfall of the gale.
Into the pallid twilight race.
And sigh and sorrow as they fail.
The snows that stilled the forests' surge
As down the heaven they flew and fell.
Now mourn the year with, frosty dlrpe'
Now clank, o 1 nights, hia passing-bell!
With all the seasons, stern or kind
Out of eternity there sings
Into eternity the wind,
God's mercy in its murmurings.

handed person as a clerk or bookkeeper,
and the prejudice against them ex
tends to the Government departments
at Washington. The chiefs of those de
partments are entirely willing to over
look bad penmanship on the part of a
really good and industrious clerk, but it
is the man or woman who writes with
the left hand at which the balk is
made. The deadline is drawn just the
moment It Is ascertained that a clerk Is
left-handed, and he is forthwith In
formed that if it is his desire to con
tinue in Government service it will be
necessary for him to write with his
right hand*- This information is always
a bitter pill for the left-handed pen
holders, but there is nothing to do but
begin to write with the right hand or
"throw up the 4<>b," and few are anx
ious to quit Government service even
for this cause. No matter how perfect
a hand a left-handed clerk may write,
there is no alternative but to learn to
write with the right hand, and some
times It takes months to get to the
point where even a legible hand 13
written by the clerk who is forced to
"learn the business over," but during
this period of making the change the
chiefs are easy and patient and makÂ«
the work as light as possible on thÂ« un
fortunate clerk.

Kittredge of South Dakota has set
out to make a career for himself in the
Senate. He is one of the youngest men
there, just turned 40. and he has only
held his seat for two years, but he Is al
ready edging Into the influential group
that determines what shall and what
shall not be done. Kittredge Is a bach
elor, weighs considerably more than 200
pounds and has a face that would be a
fortune at a poker table. Up graduated
from Tale In 18S2, and he Is a great
chum of John Kean of New Jersey, an
other Yale man. He has made up his
mind that he will stay In the Senate
as long as South Dakota remains Re
publican, and he sees no Immediate
prospect of a change In the politics of
the State. He spends more time on the
floor of the Senate than any other man
there. It is a rare thing for him to be
found outside the chamber unless he is
called out by the card of a. visitor. He
watches every piece of legislation, and
he knows what is going on all the time.
A r o Excitement.
In Panama under the Colombian
regime one could get up a "revolution"
almost at a moment's notice. Such
slight matters, says the New York
Times, scarcely interrupted the routine
of business.
One day a number of American trav
elers had taken their seats at breakfast
when they were startled by loud shouts
in the street. They hastened to the
window and saw a crowd of men in
greasy, ragged clothes rushing along,
brandishing machetes.
"What is the trouble?" one of them
asked their Colombian host.
"Why." he said, apologetically, "I am
afraid it is a revolution."
The travelers began to be excited.
but were calmed by the sweet voice of
the hostess addressing her husband In
ordinary tones:
"Did I put enough sugar in your cof
fee. Gabriel?"

"Well, it's one of the places."

PERALTA GRANT
CASE IS ENDED
Court Hands Down Opinion
Dismissing Claim to the
Water Front of Oakland
MILLIONS ARE INVOLVED
Farewell Appearance of a
Suit That Was Begun
Nearly Fifty Years Ago
!
In the United States District Court
yesterday United States District Judge
C. B. Bellinger of Portland, Or., hand
ed down a decision denying the motion
of Mary ]$. H. Gwin and Miers F.
Truett, intervenors in the case of
I Vicente Peralta and others, vb. the
I United States of America for an order
of court commanding the United States
to issue to them a patent for a por
tion of the lands of the Rancho San
Antonio, which ranch embraces 46.6S5
j acres in Alameda County and on which
i the cities of Oakland and Alameda are
situated* Added to these there are 2352
acres of unpatented land held by the
! United States which the Intervenors
j claim. This is known as the Oakland
i water front and is the bone of conten
tion in the case, the remainder of the
I rancho having been transferred. It is
valued at $25,000,000.
LINE OF THE BAY.
The following are extracts from the
] decision:
The controversy that has arisen grows out
J of-the fact that in the execution of the decree
i of the District Court affirmed on appeal the
I words "Bay of San Francisco." employed to
describe the west boundary of the Peralta
grant, were erroneously Interpreted to mean
the line of ordinary high water of the bay so
run as to exclude from the erant the swamp
lands in the estuaries of the bay. But for
this error there would have been full compll
j ance with the decree under which the peti
tioners claim within their present contention.
Whether the line of the bay of San Fran
cisco includes the swamp lands of the estuary
of Pan Antonio was a question for the deter
, mination of The District Court, and an error
o.,mmitted in determining It does not affect
: tho completeness of what was done. Errors
! of judgment In such a case are open to cor
i ruction on application to the court committing
them nnd on animal: without this the parties
[ are concluded by what is decided. The went
: boundary of th? confirmed grant is described
in the decree of 1S39 as the bay of San Fran
! Cisco. The decree of 1S(K! undertakes merely
to cive a precise location to the lin? of this
bay, and was In aid of the prior decree. The
survey and location of this line was a proceed
ing under the control of the court, and a part
of its Judicial action.
DECREE IS EXECUTED.
ThÂ» â â -xecutlcn of the decree of confirmation
has l.een made complete^ by the Issuance of
patents. The presumption Is that thesÂ» patents
were is-vmed to tho claimants at thÂ»lr Injrtance,
upon their tiresentaticn, as prescribed by the
art of Congress, to the General Land Office
of the decree of confirmation and plat of sur
vey. TJie.se patents conformed to the survey
and were for the entire confirmed crant. ac
cording to the boundaries prrciaely fixed by
the decree of tl<e court, and located by the
hurvpy; and they are final and conclusive as
to the claimants" rights from the United States
under the decree of confirmation. Moon* vs
Steinbach. 127 I*. 8., iÂ«; Casrldav vb Carr.

The right of the attorneys opposing this mo
tion to be heard does not affect the question.
The record niakf* its own auuearance. and It
is roncluslve acainst the motion. It shows
that thÂ» entire matter in r*>s adjudicata. Nev
ertheless, there is no weapon why the United
.States Fhould not be heard upon a motion for
an orJer rrsjiecting its duty, to say that sach
duty lias been i> e rlormed.

tion are ureoluded in any right they might
otherwise have had. by their laches Their
grantors were satisfied with the execution of
the decree of confirmation at the time More
than thirty years elapsed after the amended

I MINGLES HEART INTEREST
WITH TECHNICAL TEACHING
Lieutenant Cxirden's Lecture on AVlmt
He Saw In Industrial Europe Ap
peals to Hearers.
Lieutenant Godfrey Lynet Carden of
the United States revenue cutter ser
vice entertained a fair-sized audience
last evening: in the Young Men's Chris
tian Association auditorium with an il
lustrated lecture descriptive of his trip
through industrial Europe in quest of
machinery exhibits for the St. Louis
Exposition. He visited all the great
Iron manufacturing centers and ob
tained numerous stereopticon plates,
that served to illustrate his talk.
To the person versed in the technique
of the machinist's trade the lecture was
especially instructive, of course, but it
contained enough incidental heart in
terest to engage the attention of the
women in the assemblage. The descrip
tion and accompanying pictures of the
Krupp works in Germany and of how
the 80.009 employes and their families
live were interesting to every student
of industrial conditions.
Lieutenant Carden explained how
Krupp's great army of workmen shares
the prosperity, but not 'directly the
profits, of their employer, and how they
dwell more comfortably than the aver
age mechanic in this country, whose
wages are 50 per cent more than theirs.
He laid stress upon the statement that
the city built by the Krupps is as near
millennium as the wage-worker can
hope to approach, and he emphasized
r.lso the declaration that paternalism
is no part of the Krupp system.
Another important assertion made by
the lecturer was that while our ma
chinists bfat the world in rapidity of
T.-ork, they are beaten by Europe in the
general perfection of the work turned
out except in the manufacture of ma
chine tools. Machine tools made in the
United States are to be found In the
leading foundries of Europe, he said,
and Europe seems to be unable to du
plicate them.
Collateral Inheritance Tar.
City Attorney Long advised the Su
pervisors' Finance Committee yester
day that there is no litigation regard
ing the status of the collateral inherit
ance tax, but there are two cases pend
ing affecting the right of the City
Treasurer to retain a certain percent
age of such taxes collected.
Swallows Quantity of Iodine.
JIary O'Leary of 1170 Oak street at

Boskowitz of the Emergency Hospital
pumped her stomach out and the wo
man will recover. She had had a
quarrel v.ith her husband.

THE MASTENS
GREET THRONGS
OF GAY GUESTS
By Sally Sharp.
Rising, out of the gray solemnity of
Lent, the reception of Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Manuel Masten at the Century
Clubhouse last night stood out with
brilliant prominenceâ brilliantly be
fitting the happy occasion it celebrated
âthe fifteenth anniversary of the wed
ding of the host and hostess.
The clubhouse Â«was garlanded from
end to end with forest branches, palms
and fragile ferns, while billows of red
tulle and red ribbons were looped
among the glistening leaves.
From a latticed bower, lantern hung,
the music-makers sent forth the merry
melodyâ not the crashing, clanging
kind that strangles pleasant chatter,
but soft, sweet, seductive melody.
Mr. and Mrs. Masten received their
guests alone, extending greeting to
nearly 400 friends, many of whom had
been guests at their wedding.
A pretty bride was Mrs. Masten last
night, gowned in a robe of glistening
lace, her white shoulders outlined by
a bertha of exquisite lace.
Among the throng of guests were
some stunningly gowned women,
among whom were Mrs. William L.
Hughson, who wore an exquisite gown
of -white Bilk showered with violets,
the transparent corsage outlined with
a bertha of rare lace. With this cos
tume Mrs. Hughson, who is a stat
esque tj r pe of beauty, wore a white
Gainsborough hat, feather laden.
Mrs. Thomas Morffew, always hand
somely gowned, wore a gray chiffon
cloth robe heavily trimmed with Irish
point, with the Frenchiest of blue
and pink flowers glowing through the
creamy meshes of the lace. In her hau
she wore a pink pompon.
Mrs. Arthur Whipple Spear was
gowned smartly in white chiffon with
duchess lace.
Miss Charlette Hall wore a very be
coming frock of pink chiffon with a
chaplet of pink roses.
Mrs. Herbert Hodgdon's gown of
blue chiffon, hand painted and trim
med with frosted lace, was one of the
notably pretty costumes worn â and
there were many other smart ones.
Both, before and after supper the
younger set danced merrily, and the
hours flew, even as at a preordained
dance.

guests invited:

Advertising Matter Must
Not Interfere With Mark
or Legibility of Address
General misunderstanding appears
to exist with reference to the require
ments of the postofflce authorities for
post cards, commonly called "postal"
cards, printed by individuals and firms
for business purposes. The follow
ing are the regulations governing such
matters:
Post cards must conform to the following
conditions: Each card must be an unfolded
piece of cardboard not exceeding the size
fixed by the convention of the Universal Pos
tal Union (9 by 14 centimeters, which la ap
proximately 3 9-16 Inches by S 9-16 Inches),
nor lees than the minimum size of domestic
postal cards (2 15-16 by 4% Inches). Quality
and weight of paper and form must be sub
stantially that of the Government postal card
of like size. They may be of any color which
doe* not interfere with the legibility of the
address and postmark. Each card must bear
the words "Post Card" at the top of the ad
drees side, unobstructed by any other matter;
paid words to be placed thereon. In conspic
uous letters and in such manner as not to In
terfere with a perfectly distinct address and
postmark. The address may be written, print
ed or stamped, or on an adhesive label of not
more than three-quarters of ar% Inch by two
In size, and the sender may, in the same man
ner, place his name and address on the back
or the face of the card. The message may
be In writing or In print. When post cards
are prepared by printers and stationers for
sale they should. In addition, bear In the up
per righthand corner of the face an oblong
diagram containing the words, "This side for
the address."
Advertisements and Illustrations in, any color
may be printed upon either or both aides of
a post card, provided they do not, when placed
upon the face thereof. Interfere with a per
fectly distinct address and postmark.
The words "post card" are authorized only
on cards which conform to the conditions pre
scribed by these regulations; other cards bear
ing these words, or otherwise purporting to
be Issued under authority of the act of May
1Â», 1S98, are unmallable as "post cards," and
whether the message be written or printed are
subject to postage at the letter rateâ 2 cents
per ounce.
Printed cards on which there la no writing
and which do not purport to be post cards and
which are advertisements simply and not con
veying oersonal Information are mallable as
printed matter. There is no restriction as to
size, but the weig-ht of any single package
must not exceed four pounds.
On January 16. 19<M, the department Issued
an order that cards issued by private persons
and bearlnsr on the address side the. words
â¢'United States of America," are In "likeness
or similitude" of the regular United States
postal card, and therefore In violation of law
and unmallable at any price after July 1, 1904.
This is the latest order in relation
to the matter.

Town Talk's household number for
February is a magazine of exceptional
interest. It abounds in breezy fiction,
sprightly comment, liitlnc satire and ex
clusive news concerning people of prom

Notwithstanding the addition of many
new and catchy features, the regular de
"partroents of this bright and entertain

There is some inside information in the
Saunterer's columns about the new Dis
trict Judpeship and about McXab'a latest
conference with Hearst. Mrs. Cardan's
reason for no longer taking an interest
in literature is explained. There is a
story about another row among the- Na
tive Daughters, one about the snubbing
of a Burlingame matron and one about
a fight at the Mardi Gras ) ball. Mrs.
Clarence Mackay's book is discussed;
also, our crook-ridden city, and the cir
cumstances that point to a copartnership
i between the police and the thugs. Inci
dentally there is an explanation of why
the Iroquois Clubmen did not indorse

In the match last Sunday between
the Vampires and the Thistles the nar
row, slippery ground was against the
f"nmr teair. whose forward line is
weak. The Thistle forward and half
back lines are the strongest part of
their team and outplayed the Vam
pires. The Thistles have two matches
Jor the championship still to play. It
if almost certain they will win both
of them. If they lose both of them
and the Independents win both of their
two remaining matches the Thistles
and the Independents will each have 19
points for the season.
If two teams tie in number of points,
the championship is usually decided by
poal average, which is found either by
subtracting the goals made against a
team from the poals made by it. or
by noting what proportion the goals
made for and against bear to each
other. During the season the Thistles
have scored Z7> poals, three having been
made apainst them, leaving a majority
In their favor of 32.
The Independents have scored 34
S?oalP, and Â«?ight have been made agains
them, giving: a balance in their favor
oi 26. To bring the Independents to
the same position as the Thistles it is
necessary for them to score six goals
clear after the deduction of the goals
made against them in the two remain
ing matches, and this is hardly likely.
Comparing the goals in another way.
the Thistles have made, within a frac
tion, twelve times as many goals as
have been made against them. The
standing of the clubs for the cham
pionship of the league is as follows:

ATHLETES AT STANFORD.
Indoor Work Replaces That of the
Held in Increment Weather.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 26.
The rain during the week has inter
fered considerably with the work of
the varsity athletes, particularly on
the diamond. However, Captain Ball
of the varsity nine has issued an order
to the ball tosscrs that will give them
an opportunity to keep up with the
game even on days when weather will i
not permit practice on the diamond.
Hereafter when the weather condi
tions are unfavorable the candidates
for the varsity nine will assemble in
Kncina Hall and talk over plays and
the fine points of the national game
â with Coach Doyle.
- That the pitcher's position on the
varsity nine will be well filled this
year despite the loss of Parker, the
veteran twirler, has been shown by
the work -of Tritch. '04, in the game
With Ireland's Independents on last
Saturday, and of Sales, '06, who pitch
ed the twelve-inning 4 to 4 game
against Santa Clara the previous
Thrusday. Both of these pitchers,
and Sales particularly, have improved
remarkably. Sales at present leads
the batting list and is hitting more
consistently than any other man on
the diamond.
In order to increase the interest in
track work and brins out the best the
track athletes have in them Trainer
"Dad" Moulton of the varsity track
team has introduced a series of week-
COLORS OF MANY NEW OWNERS
TO BE SEEN AT TANFORAN
The recent meet of the Pacific Coast
Polo and Pony Racing Association at
Del Monte gave . pony racing a stim
ulus that augurs well for the future
of that Dastime of sportmen on this
coast. . '
II was the opinion of experts that
there had never been a, faster lot of
ponies gathered in one incloaure than
were seen at Del Monte. As AV. S. Ho
bart's Silver Dick in the sprints and
F. J. Cardan's. Fusillade in the dis
tance events represented the class of
the affair this statement seems reason
able. . ". .
The next meet of the association will
be held at Tanforan racecourse'. oh
March 12 and 14. The colors of a num
ber of new owners will- be â¢seen', for
the first time on this occasion. Pony,
racing appeals to many men who- look
upon a large racing stable as entailing
too much responsibility. . - - â â  â¢;,
Throughout California on -various
ranches where thoroughbreds - are
raised there are many undersized race
horses of royal, breeding. .Owing to
their lack of size they were probably
turned out on the range and left to
shift for themselves. One, gentleman
who has done much to advance -pony
racing asked I a breeder if he had;any.
ponies. The latter replied he did ' not
think he had, but upon looking. ".over
his stock he found fifteen, which were
ly track meets to be held on the oval
every Saturday morning. Last Satur
day an inter-departmental -field- day
was held, in. which the law depart
ment athletes proved the victors. To
morrow mornig the meet will be.be
tween the college independents or
"barbs" and the fraternity men. A
close meet is expected, as the frater
nity and non-fraternity men on the
track squad are about evenly divided.
Considering the heavy condition of
the track last Saturday . the showing
made by the track men was encourag
ing. Gay. '04; Thomas,. '04, ~, and
Weinmann, '06, ran a close race in the
mile. Gay winning in 5:02. Captain
Holman, the fastest man in the dis-'
tance, did not enter the .race. . ..

record In the pole - vault, ' is - training

The question of Silver Dick's limit of
speed is still unanswered. . He . seems
just able to "win, no matter at what
pace his opponents carry him through
the stretch. Walter. Hc-bart speaks af
fectionately of him as "my old plug.''
Until Dick gets in action this seems
a, good title- for. him. Hs is as gentle
as a lamb at the post. If a false start
is, made his rider has only to let go
his hold on the reins and .Dick pulls
up.- He cuts all his finishes close, need
ing considerable, shaking up to .make
hinr see the' seriousness of the situa
tion. . , . ' \,
â Mr. Hobart paid $1000 for him two
years ago in Denver. He was original
ly-owned by the Cabaniss ' brothers, the'
outlaws... They took him about the
Rocky â¢ Mountain â '.' district, racing him
against quarter "horses. Dick's next
owner had hfm.as^a'pet for. his-chil
dren. They; used to tie thelrjsled to
his tail and then drove him about with
out bridle or restraining halter in. child

of Eecreation on the Water
It is expected that a large number
of oarsmen will be at the new Ariel
Rowing Club .quarters to-morrow, as
great Interest Is being shown by the
members.' On a fine Sunday five or six
barges, several outrigged skiffs and
whitehalls are in use the whole day.
The club swimmers also take advan
tage of the opportunities for their fa
vorite recreation.
It will be necessary for the South
End Rowing Club to decide upon plans
for., their new boathouse at an early
day, for the: club has been served With
notice that its old quarters at the foot
of Third street must be removed with
out delay, that work may be begun
upon a bridge which the Santa Fe Rail
way -Company desires to construct
across the channel.
When the. "rowing club was notified
to move it obtained an extension of
time until July 1 of last year, and so
has had ample notice. When the South
End Rowing Club gets comfortably set
tled on the site next to the Ariel Row
ing. Club .it, is expected a period of
great activity will set in among the
oarsmen on the south side of the city.
At "the last; regular .meeting . of the
Alameda : Boating Club a handsome
gold â¢ locket was presented to Charles
H. Smith, who held the presidency of
the;, club- for more than a dozen terms

BLUE AND GOLD
MEN IN TRAINING
Berkeley Oval Is the Scene of
Marked Activity When the
Weather. Is Propitious
BERKELEY, Feb. 26.â There will be
a succession of field days at the Uni
versity of California to test the mettle
and the strength of the college athletes
which will set the campus in a roar.
First of all will come the trials on
March 5 between the athletes of the
freshman and sophomore classes. This
will be followed by the interclass meet
on March 19, the meet with Pomona
College on March 30. the meet with
Stanford on April 16 and lastly with
the Universiry of "Washington on the
last day of April.
In anticipation of* these tests the
sprinters and jumpers and weight
throwers practice every day on the
oval. On good days there are some
times as many as fifty men working out
on the cinder path. They are all under
the supervision of Trainer "Walter
Christie, who is devoting his whole time
this year to the preparation of the men.
While there is a lack of great mate
rial for the athletic events this year,
California still hopes for victory in the
clash with Stanford. The trouble is
that California has lost most of the
best of last year's material and has not
received any "phenoms" through the
infusion of freshman blood.
In the place where California is weak.
est she has not been recruited at all.
This is the 440-yard dash, where there
is only "Greek" Howard to defend.
Howard ran fourth in last year's inter
collegiate meet. Dunn and Crossly, who
ran first and second, respectively, in
that' trial, have been retained by Stan
ford.
California lias been more fortunate in
the sprints, fn this department she has
recruited four promising youngsters.
Best of these perhaps Is Hughes, who
did such valiant work for the Oakland
High School last year. Then there are
Davis of Marysville and Bingham and
Lippman of San Francisco, all them
freshmen who performed well in their
academic days. Besides this material
there will be Abadie, who has always
been depended upon for the 100-yard
and 220-yard dashes.
The half-mile is reasonably safe for
California unless Stanford succeeds, in
developing some fast new man. There
will be three of last year's men to de
fend in this eventâ Edwards, Xewhall
and Cliffordâ all of them stayers and
fast for the distance. Then they will
get assistance from two freshmen.
Head and Wilcox, formerly of the Oak
land High School.
For the mile there will be Xewhall.
Hackley and Clifford, and Tieciiert. a
freshman. Hackley has developed' a
good deal of speed lately.
Tibbets won the two-mile last year
with ease, but there is some talk of his
being in bad form just now. Tibbets is
not sure how fit he wil be, but Is taking
LEASHMEN PLAY
A NOVEL STAKE
FOR COURSERS
Endeavor to Bring: Together
the Fleetest Eight Grey
hounds Now in Training
HEAVY REGISTKATIOXS
Marked Revival of Interest
Is Shown by the Breeders
Throughout the Country
The promoters of coursing In this dis
trict are devising: stakes with novel
conditions in order to bring the fleetest
greyhounds together and to revive the
lagging interest of the people by whom
the sport has been so liberally main
tained.
The latest of these events is the
Grand National Champion stake, to be
competed for by the best eight dogs in
California, which also means the best
eight in America. There will be no en
trance fee and the hounds will be
paired off by a committee of coursing
men in order to match them as closely
as possible.
The first trial will be run on March 6.
the two dogs drawn running the best
three in five trials. The winner will
receive $100. Two more dogs will be run
the following Sunday, and so on until
the first round is completed. The four
winners will then run, each for a hun
dred dollar prize. This will bring thu
stake down to the last pair. The ulti
mate winner will have received in all
$400, the runner-up $200 and the other
two $100 each.
The greyhounds which are considered
eligible are: Pocatelli. Palo Alto, Full
Moon, Mount Rose. Rubber Ankles,
Rector, Fair Tralee. Lord Brazen.
Barge, Charter Member, Silver Heels.
Tillie R, Quita. Sacramento Boy. Pasha
Pleasant and Sea Lion.
The problem which now confronts
the coursing officials is how to deter
mine which are the best eight and how
to proceed to pair them off.
Blake and Smith, the Montana cours
ing men, have departed for home with
their string of greyhounds. The Butte
eeason opens early this year and they
want to get their string ready for cam
paigning. During their visit here they
proved thorough sportsmen. Their
dogs were always in condition and they
accepted either victory or defeat in a
graceful manner.
F. M. Kellogg of Gilmore City. Iowa,
has also returned home after spending
several months here.
P. E. Callan has sold Sempronius to
Jerry Bresnahan.
"YV. H. Kocher is preparing to disband
his kennels owing to his leaving the
State. Among his hounds are Boots,
Ploughman, Dear Gaston, Pacing Billy
and some puppies listed in this year's
Futurity.
"W. J. Leonard has sold Tom Hurlick
to G. "Wash.
The keeper of the American Grey
hound Studbook has listed the record
number of litters since the first of the
year. The total is sixty, which repre
sents about 300 puppies. This is an un
usually heavy qpgistration and shows a
revival of interest in coursing and
gi-eyhound breeding throughout the
country.
The season opens unusually early
this year in the Middle West. Okla
homa City starts matters moving next
week with a big meet.
Sacramento has produced so many
great greyhounds in recent years that
the enthusiasts of the capital city
want to match eight of their represen
tatives against a like number represent
ing the entire State. The Sacramento
dogs would be: Pocatelli. Sacramento
Boy, Barge, Tillie R, Silver Heels,
Charter Member, Quita and Red Rock.
The novel match will probably be made
and liberal prizes will bring out some
stiff competition.
The coursing at Union Park to-mor
row will commence upon the arrival oi
the 10:15 a. m. train. While the names
of champions are not conspicuous
among the greyhounds entered, there i*
an even quality represented which
should result in close contests. The
likely winners look to be:
Red Rock. Helen May... Rocker Arm. Feni!.
Donnybrook. Sea Lion. Vandal. Little Plunger
Booth. Lord Brazen. Apple Blossom. Itoby
Aurora. Frisco Lad. Rapid Water. Uly Tcrk
McHenry, Adonis. Mcncy Musk. Rolla Well*
Fair Tralee, John Heenaa. Viva, Gambit.
Renegade Apache, Radius Auto. Cloverdale
Eagle, The Rereree. Richard Anton. Sempro
nius. Amandan, Ruby Sankey.
Sixty-four well-matched hounds will
compete to-morrow at Ingleside Park.
The first brace wil go to the slips at
10:30 o'clock. <â¢ The likely winners in
the first round look to be:
Gold Lily. Una. Presidio Boy. Meddlesome

respective schools in academic meets.
The veterans are Frei. Chaplin and
Meany, the last named being about the
best.
For the high jump there will be Cap

with good chances of winning. Wilcox

vault, but as they were defeated hand
ily by Dole of Stanford in the last meet
they are not expected to win, as they

Claude Kern, captain of the freshman
football team, is going in for the broad
jump, as are also Chaplin, Neighbor

PRINCESS TITANIA TAKES HANDICAP,
AND ANANIAS RUNS DISAPPOINTINGLY
Norton Wins From
The Fretter in
a Drive.
Just ore week ago yesterday
Princess Titania. ridden by Willie See,
was beaten by Ananias in a handicap.
The Princess had her revenge at Oak
land yesterday In the six-furlong
handicap, and hÂ«>r previous defeat now
tH-en;g like a hideous, improbable
r.ight mare.
There were but four starters, and
in the early betting it was 8 to 5
and take your pick about Ananias and
Princess Titania. with little doing on
Futurita and U'llagen, each looking
< utctasaed on recent form. Toward
l>ost time Caesar Young's mare had
a slight call over Ananias.
The race its-elf was a Joke, for the
Princess raced Ananias off his feet
the first quarter and won by four or
five open lengths, with John Bullman
iioir.s down for fresh wraps. Johnny
Schorr's colt quit so badly that
O'Hagen led him out a couple of
lengths for the place. Futurlta quit
in the run to the wire.

Rain fell almopt steadily, the track
â¢was ankle deep with sloppy mud and
altogether it was most disagreeable
r&cing weather. The attendance, how
ever, was good, and the bookmakers
ppent no idle moments. Three favor
ites finished in front.
Possart, an 11 to 5 favorite, with Wil
lie See on her back, captured the open
ing seven-furlong selling affair without
much effort from Billy Moore* The
black horse took the lead from Gold
Finder before the stretcn was reached,
scoring by nearlj' three lengths. Touns
Morello, the second choic*. came in for
considerable support at odds of 13 tc
I and finished â  third, after a rather
uneven voyage. Sunello started for the
firet time this season but apparently
was not ready.

touched 13 to o. The gelding cut no

third to Lady Kent and Mr. Dingle on
Wednesday. 4 to 1 looked a liberal
quotation against Glissar.do in the bet

and was practically left. â¢ !
Stupid work at the post on the part
of Jerry Hoach accomplished the de
feat cf Lansdowr.e. the heaviest played
favorite of the day, in the fifth num
ber, a Futurity course sprint. Jerry
â¢â¢was flow as a country storekeeper at
the post and his mount was badly out

vorite responded to punishment in the
stretch and was only beaten a head
and a neck by Quiz and Sol Lichten
stein. The winner. Quiz, from the sta
ble of Charley McCafferty, closed at
7 to 1 in the ring. Amasa, a etanchly
backed starter, met with some inter
ference through the stretch, finishing
fifth, behind Pruewood.
. Although far fnrm being at his best,
.Horton managed to win the conclud
ing mile and fifty-j-ard run from The
Fretter In a driving finish. The little
chestnut horse at one time looked hope
lessly out of it, but closed with a cy

GARDNER AND ROOT.
IX A DRAWN BATTLE
Fight Six Fast Hounds at Chicago in
Which Both Are
Punished.
CHICAGO, Feb. 26. â Jack Root of
this city and George Gardner of Low
ell, Mass., fought a six-round draw
here to-night.
The fight was fast throughout and,
with the exception of the third round,
when Root had the better, and the
fifth, when Gardner evened up the
advantage Root had gained, the fight
was even.
Root played for the Jaw and Gard
ner for the body all through. Root
landed frequently on 3 the jaw in the
third round and at the close Gardner
was hanging on. In the fifth round
Gardner gave Root a severe pounding
on the body and sent him to his cor
ner badly weakened. Both men fought
desperately in the last round. ..Root
landed a hard right on the jaw that
forced Gardner to clinch. He recov
ered quickly, however, and evened
matters up by a series of heavy body
blows. Both men were bleeding bad
ly at the finish. -
with MacGavin and Variel and the
Baker brothers. It has since devel
oped that the Murdock brothers are
the last team in the upper half. This
lessens the chances of some of the
teams in this half, but will make the
: matches better not only in the finals,
but in the preliminary rounds. With
the Murdock brothers and Carl Gard
ner and Clarence Griffin in the upper
half and the Baker brothers and Mac-
Gavin and Variel in the lower the
finals will be much more' interesting.
The correct drawing is as follows:
Preliminary roundâ S. Talcott and W. Mil
wain vb. JF\ Webster and Gage; Lee and Rob
bins vb. C. Griffin and C. Gardner; G. Janes
and H. Ruhsell vÂ«. K. Otis and Gott; N. Fos

CHESTER BEATS
BIG JIM FOX IN
FOUR-ROUND GO
Joe Carroll Is Given Decision
Over W./ Leonard - Amid
Hisses From the Spectators
LUNDIE BESTS McGARTHY
Second Xiglit of the Boxing
Show at Olympic Club Is
Exciting 1 and Interesting
The big gymnasium of the Olympic
Club fairly echoed with the sound of
rebounding blows and the atmosphere
about the ring was all but mixed with
gore last night before the final contest
of the amateur boxing tournament had
been' decided. It was a gala night for
the lovers of the manly art. As fast as
two- boxers had gone through the for
mality of punching each other another
pair was ever ready to step into the
ring and do likewise. . â .
In'all [seventeen hot scraps were on
the card. Fighters of every class and
fighters of all known styles vied with
one' another for honors in "the roped
arena' On the whole, thfe representa
tives of the AVinged "0" were success
ful. Harry Chester captured the^.rriain
event of the evening in the light heavy
weight class from James Fox after ,a
mill that was replete with sensational
going. â 'â -,â '.-â¢ y' '-'.;. â  ";
Fox started in at the Olympic Club
lad and seemed to be" cantering home
with victory when the tall youth took. a
hunch, and then the scrapping wa"s fair
ly well on. Chester was groggy when he
made his final stand, but the shouts of
the crowd encouraged him and he sailed
into Fox and landed swing after swing.
This all happened in the second
round. In the third Fox came up strong
again, and it was wallop for wallop,
with both men all-in and ready to stay
on the carpet if they happened to, fall.
An extra round was called, and Chester
was the king of this one. He forced the
fighting all the way, and although
groggy at the finish was declared the
winner. â¢ .
CROWD 1IISSKS DKCISIOX.
Joe Carroll, the jabbing jid from the
Occidental Club, wrested the* honors, in
the 125-pound class from Billy Leon
ard, the Olympic Club man, after an
extra round had been reeled off. It was
an unpopular decision, as Leonard
forced the fighting from the tap of the
gong and was willing tv take two
punches In order to land one. Carroll
would not mix it and insisted on stay
ing away and pegging with his left.
It was even after three rounds had
been gone through," and the. judges re
fused to give a decision. . In the fourth
Leonard maintained his rushing tactics
and seemed to have Carroll on the road
to the land of the groggy. The judges
decided against their own club man and
the crowd hissed and hissed and said
many unkind things.
Tom McGreal, the tough looking mid
dle-weight, lost and won. He beat
George Murray in the first go, land
ing at will and making a good show
ing. Murray was afraid of McGreal's
wallop and was also wild with his
swings, so the decision was McGreal's
by a length. The latter went up
against Frank Smith in the final bout
of the night and Smith was beating
him so badly that Referee Graney stop
ped the fight in the third round. Mc-
Greal seemed tired after the first round
and, though game to the core, never
had a chance with Smith.
Bob Lundie was given the palm over
Jack McCarthy in the main lightweight
go of the night and this made the spec
tators angry. It: was a real tough bat
tle and an extra round had to be called.
Lundie forced the fighting all the way.
but McCarthy was clever and did some
good work. At that Lunaie had him
all but out in the last round.
YOUNG FIGHTS TWICE.
. Al Young was on for two bouts. His
first was with Bert Marsh. The latter
did not have a look in and the bout
was stopped in the second round. It
came nearly as easy for Young in the
other bout, for his opponent, Charles
Cooper, was helpless and the fight-was
stopped in the first.
Cooper in the meantime had out
pointed James Young. James MC-
Cann went to the carpet for keeps in
the second round of his go with James
Ryan and Joe Sharkey was not as fast
as his namesake, fqr Willie Wolfe took
all the fight out of him in a round.
Chic little \Willie Dwyer, the
feather, lost to Eddie Carroll in three
rounds after having beaten Joe Leahy
nearly to death in the earlier part of
the evening. Willie fought well at
that and seemed to be winning till the
third round. Then Carroll came
strongly and his many leads won him
the fight. Carroll was also the hero
of two engagements, winning his first
go of three rounds from Al Ridge.
Bob Cairns mixed it with Frank
Flores and won after the mill had
gone the limit. Flores was not wise
and commenced to get in his good
wallops when it was too late. Cairns
showed his usual carelessness, and if
Flores was only possessed of a little
more solid ring sense Bob would cer
tainly have taken a trip to dreamland.
Harry Tenny and Barney Driscoll
came through with the . best fight
among the little men. Tenny won
the decision, though it was close. Both
boys fought hard and , were ready and
willing to take any kind of a chance.
Georgie Finnegan nearly scared Eddie
Smith out of the ring .before their
bout was a minute old and it had to
be stopped. Clever Jack . Lenahan
won handily from Dave Campbell in
a tame three-round affair.
"Dixie Kid" a Winner.
FRESNO. , Feb. 26. â "Dixie Kid"
knocked out John Solomon of Fresno
in' the eleventh round of a scheduled
twenty-round â¢ go j before | the , Central
California Athletic Club 'to-night. At

of "cheating in class work," Fred Bell,
the crack distance runner of the Uni

Morley of the local team, who resigned
on Wednesday night because the Pa
cific Coast League had voted to release
Dillon to Brooklyn, received the fol
lowing telegram to-day from Ban
Johnson, president of the American.
League, and one of the conferees at
the meeting recently of baseball mag
nates at San Francisco:
"National League has no Jurisdic
tion over Dillon. My understanding
you .retain Ed Dillon, assuming you
had first contract with that player."
This telegram is in answer to one
sent to Johnson last night asking if
the National Association of Minor
Leagues has any jurisdiction over Dil
lon, who is claimed by a major league
club.
Johnson has taken Morley's view of
the matter and it is reasonably cer
tain that Dillon will remain with the
Los Angeles team and that Morley's
resignation will not be acepted. by the
local association.

This invention has for its object the production of a novel -lamp, particularly desirable for use as a I
' night lamp. Lamps for this purpose need not produce a large flame; 'in fact, a comparatively small flame is (
1 more desirable, but it is also desirable that the lamp be capable of burning for a long period without refilling <
i and without attention and without emitting any odor. These results are positively obtained. Directions
for use with each lamp. ' '

WAR STUDENTS
SEEK QUARTERS
Mayor of Leavenworth Asked
to Provide Accommoda
tions for a Short Time
LEAVENWORTH, Feb. 26. â Briga
dier General Bell, commandant of the
general service and staff college at
Fort Leavenworth, has asked Mayor
Anthony and the Commercial Club of
this city whether it will be possible
to provide quarters here for National
Guard officers and graduates of mili
tary colleges who are to be designated
by the President to attend the war
college for a two years' course. The
communication states that the law as
passed a year or so ago authorizes
the payment of $1 a day to such stu
dents and commutation of quarters,
which amounts to about $54 a month.
Quarters will be provided for the stu
dents in the city until such quarters
can be built at Fort Leavenworth.
The class, which is toÂ« consist of
about 100 officers so chosen, is ex
pected to arrive at Fort Leavenworth
next September. There are no quar
ters for the members at the post.
It is said that, the object of the new
law will be to pick from the graduates
officers for the army, as West Point
is unable to provide a suitable num
ber.
John Sholwater Suffocated.
John Sholwater, until recently an in- !
mate of the City and County Hospital
suffering from cancer, was found dead
in bed yesterday morning in the Han- {
cock House, 781 Mission street. He had '
been suffocated by illuminating gas,
which was escaping from a partly open
burner. The door was unlocked, and it
is believed that his death was the re- 1
suit of accident. Nothing is known of
his antecedents. j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1904.
RAIN ADDS TO PROBLEM OF TAKING
RUSSIAN BEEF FROM CHINA'S HOLD
Pacific Mail Company's Liner Will Sail to-Day for the Far East
With Many Passengers, Among Them People of Note and
Four Score Japanese Going Home to Fight the Czar's Forces
SCHOONER SAUSALITO, WHICH PUT IN HERf THURSDAY NIGHT IN DISTRESS. HAVING BEEN ROUGHLY
HANDLED BY A SOUTHEASTER. HER RUDDER HEAD WAS TWISTED OFF AND OTHER SERIOUS
DAMAGE WAS SUSTAINED.
The Pacific Mail Company's steam
ship China will sail at noon to-day for
the Far 'East. The 700 tons of mess
beef consigned to the Russian Govern
ment and at the last moment ordered
to be left behind were all out of the
China by midnight yesterday and by 1
o'clock to-day the big liner will be
ready to start across the Pacific. The
beef was hauled to warehouses as it
left the China. How it will be sent to
Russia, or whether it will be sent at
all, is only known to Getz Bros, and
they are keeping their own counsel.
When Captain T. D. E. Wilson, steve
dore-in-chief to the Pacific Mail Com
pany, was ordered, to disembark thu
beef he was presented with a problem
compared with which the guessing of
Ann's age is easy. There were 4000 kegs
of the beef. They were sto.wed in the
lowermost parts of the fore and after
hold.*. To reach them hundreds of ton3
of other freight would have to be taken
out and to fill the gap left by the beef
a new arrangement of the remaining
cargo would have to be made. The
China was scheduled to sail at noon on
Friday. The order to extract the beef
was given late on Thursday. Every
thing was arranged for an early start
yesterday morning, but when the day
broke to weeping skies other arrange
ments became necessary and the steve
dore-in-chief said things which in
strength and substance corroborated
General Sherman's opinion of war.
Aw.ning's were rigged over the
hatches and several gangs of skilled
stevedores started the hunt for beef
barrels. The work was finished late last
night and when the hatches were put
on it was over merchandise so securely
stowed that Neptune may turn the
China upside down without displacing
the arrangement.
The China will carry about 2300 tons
of cargo and 350 passengers. Of these
130 are Chinese and 116 Japanese. Of
the Japs about eighty are going back
to take ud arms against Russia.
Many distinguished people will travel
to the Far East on the liner. Captain
J. B. Milton and Lieutenant Command
er Hughes of the navy are going to the
Asiatic station and will be fellow-pass
engers on the China with F. D. Che
shire and J. W. Davidson, Consuls at
the Korean ports of Mukden and An
tung. Richard Harding Davis and John
Fox Jr., both well-known writers, sail
on the liner for the Orient. Other pass
engers will be: T. J. Smith, the Yoko
hama agent for the Portland and Asi
atic Steamship Company; M. K. Ito,
Japanese secretary here for the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha; Captain H. K. Struve
and John F. Merrill.
Makes a Flying Trip.
The barkentlne Coronado. Captain Potter,
which arrived yesterday from Honolulu, made
the passage In twelve days and fourteen hours.
The bark Gerard C. Tobey left the island port
at the same time and has not yet been heard
from. In the non-arrival of the Tobey there
is great elation for Captain Potter. Th*
Honolulu marine sportsmen eaw in the even
start of the two sailing vessels an opportunity
for speculation and when Captain Potter left
the tropical shore for hln ship betting was
4 to 1 in favor of the Tobey. Th<Â» Coronad*
has made faster trips, but never showed gpeefl
to better purpose. She brought up 21,939 bags
of su^ar.
Has Very Rough Trip.
The etewmshlo City of Puebla arrived yes
terday from Victoria and Captain Jepsen re
ports that he never felt the wind blow with
such velocity as during the greater part of
the trip. The steamer was nearly twelve
hours late, having been held almost at a stand
still for Ions spells by the furious southerly
blest which fought her every foot of the way
from Cape Flattery to the Golden Gate. The
ve&sel sustained no damage, but few of the
passengers will forget the dives and plunges
that punctuated the course of their floating
hotel. Captain Jepsen estimates the velocity
of the wind, at times, as high as seventy mlleÂ«
an hour.
The Overdue List.
The vessels on the overdue list were quoted
for reinsurance yesterday as follows: Theodor.
4d per cent; Robert Rlckmers. 25 per cent;
W. F. Babcock. 15 per cent, and General Mel
linet. 15 per cent. - , ; V

Has to Turn Back.
The Standard Oil Company's clipper ship
Astral started for sea yesterday, but on ac-
count of the strong southeaster she found
blcwins outside waa obliged to return and
await more favorable weather. The wind was
blowing: about six miles an hour from the
aoutheaM at 6 o'clock in the morninr, but
by 0 o'clock It had increased to a thirty-six
mile gait and by noon was blowing forty miles
an hour from the south.
Hit by a Beer Glass.
Blanche Laraore. a colored woman, was
treated at the Harbor Hospital yesterday for
several Incised wounds, caused, she Â«atd, by
a eentleman friend who had hit her in the
face with a beer Klass.

"It ha* tx*n observed that nothing is known

NEW YORK. Feb. iÂ»6. â An attemot was

<>n'y clicht sralne v.ere oftabllehed. and at the

thHr Â«rfortÂ» to carry on the rise. There was
sor.i* increase in wiling prf esure. but this did

r,n<l the appearance of traders' ventures for a

TS..-W afwlormenth wrj- n - â¢ -f Importance,
cut uÂ»e current ntwj laflictttd the coatlau-
> ance of seme of the unfavorable features
j which hav- ke:it the markâ¬t under pressure
for sonic time cast. There was a renewal of
! gossip concerning the Northern Securities ue-
I clsicn. anJ as^eriionB of It very unfavorable
1-n character, notwithstanding the reports ot
the presence of the secret service officers In
Wall street district to ferret out any nefarious
dis.-lcsure of tht Supreme Court" s decision.
Thfse reports, if they were intended to deter
the rumor-mongers, failed of their purpose.
Railroad earnings presented an unsÂ«tisfactory
fhowlnc. with tht exception of n few of the
EontlrwÂ«*tetna. Atchiiton. Wabash and Hock
ing Valley represented the prevailing down
ward tendency of net gainings in th^ir Janu
ary rtums. The dealings for foreign account
were small, but t!Â»e uncertalntiea of the for
eign situation were not without Influence. A
periodical settlement is Impending In the stock
markets, both in Paris and Berlin, and In
dew of tÂ»<e violent declines which have oc
curred since tnese accounts were opened there
was doubt ovi-r the possible result of the set
tlement. Thr promise of a furthor increase
in the oÂ«sh rpsrvfs as a result failed to rally
I the markft, and tfcÂ« riling up of the reserve
I has reached 3. pplnt which arouses fears that
j it rerrfsf-nts a decline in business activity.
I ThÂ»> d;?niiÂ«sal of an injunction in the cofnpll

eorery of thÂ»> previous loss .n Amalgamated

Jytitire Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 26. â Under the. influence of
large' Argentine shipments and. lower. Engll3h
cables extreme weakness .pervaded the .wheat
pit at the opening. . The market -appeared tb
be In an over-bought condition and, the bearish
advlce3 Xrom f orelsn. markets â  served ! as ati
excuse for general profit-taking. Opening
prices were rather erratic. Initial sales of
May were made at $1 05@l 07; high. $1 07;
loiv $1 04%; close, $1 04%: a decltncof J ,4c
to 2Vic from last night's closing. For a time
the selling was fast and" furious. .When the
July delivery touched 95% c 'there were large
buying orders. The crowd 'took - the :fact as
a hint that the firmness of wheat was per
haps no more than a i flash In the pan. The
demand seemed to be as urgent as it had been
at any time during the present bull campaign.
A full recovery was made. May advancing to
$1 07 and July to !>8^ic. The market turned
weak again during the latter part of the day.
Open selling of both May and July by the
leading longs started prices on the downwaid
grade. Moderately bearish â¢ reports of the con
dition of the winter wheat brought out some
selling, while Intimations ot an increased
movement of grain ndded to the depression.
The Felling became general and prices rapidly
declined. May dropped to $1 04% and July
Went back to !>fic. Covering by shorts caused
some recovery- but the clo?e was weak, with
May at $1 04*s, July closing at 96%c.
Lower cables caused weakness in corn at
the start, i May opened lie to %Â®%c lower

The oats market was a sympathetic one.

the leadership of May pork. There was heavy
selling by big houses early In the day, with

V WHEATâ The foreign markets were tame
ana featureless, though generally firm. The
Chicago market was lower and wires from
there said that the markets were apparently
getting used to the political situation and that
there was less uneasiness as to what might
happen. â¢ â  â¢ â  -
The Minneapolis Market , Record says that
the ! receipts at Minneapolis and Duluth up to
-February- 1,' the amount ground by interior
mills and that held In country line elevators
make- an aggregate of some 122.000.000 bushels.
Farmers will, require 20.000.000 bushels for
see<l, making a total of 14Â£.0O0.0OO bushels al
ready gone from last year's crojj. From now
until next August the mills In the Northwest
will require aome 70,000,000 bushels to run
them at their usual capacity. Of this amount
there Is In Minneapolis. Duluth and interior
elevators only some 22.000.000 bushels, leaving
about 48,000,000 bushels necessary to come from
the' farm, to supply, that demand. - â -
The Handelo Zeitung of Buenos Ayres states
that the loss to the Argentine crop by frosts
was' not over 150.000 tons and that the export
able surplus will probably reach 92.0OO.0OO
bushels, against 64,000,000 last year, 24,000,000
.in 1902 and 33.200,000 in^lOOl.
This market was firm as to cash grain, but

any size was 23c. but a number of houses
which had none were obliged to go out into the '
street and buy to supply their regular trade. ;
This created a second-hand market a cent or
two above first-hand quotations and confused ;
the situation. .The quotations below are for
unbroken packages at first hands as specified.
There is practically no market for Cheese.
Sellers take what. they can get and let it go at
that. The shelves are crowded with stock.
Eggs dropped about 2c yesterday. The re
ceipts during tho past few days have been
excessive, the rains have done much to stop
local business, and in consequence stocks have
accumulated until they are standing around on
the floors in large plies. How to work them
off is a question which Is puzzling the trade, j
Tho?e large retailers who receive Eggs direct |
from the ranches are doing their share toward ]
breaking the market by offering to retail these i
Eggs at wholesale rates, and the result may
be easily Imagined.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
There waa a fair demand for the cheap
grades of Oranges among peddlers and small j
retailers during the early morning trade, but j
the market was dull the greater part of the
day owing to the stormy weather. The lead
ing retailers were indifferent buyers and were
taking no more than absolutely necessary to
meet immediate requirements, and were buy-
Ing only .large Navels at that. The auction
sale attracted very little attention, as there
was no fancy fruit offered. Three- cars of
choice and standard Navels were sold, choice
selling at SIM I 40 and standard at 40<g90c. â 
The other Citrus fruits were quiet and prices
were without quotable variance. | The Pan- |
ana cleaner brought up 175 cases of Mexican
Limes.
The best grades of Apples were still firmly '
held, but moved slowly, as dealers objected
to the high Drices. Common Apples were I

MAYOR RETURNS
THREE VETOES
Disapproves Ordinances Ex
tending Limits for Blast
ing and Sock Crushing
Mayor Schmitz yesterday returned
â¢without his approval to the Board of
Supervisors three ordinances extending
the limits within which it is prohibited
to carry on blasting and rock-crushing
rperations, and providing that a permit
must first be granted to crush rock out
tide the present prohibited limits and
requiring a bond for the payment of
resultant damages.
The proposed extension of the limits
Mas designed to prevent Gray Brothers
from carrying on operations on Thir
tieth and Castro streets, but if the
Mayor's veto is sustained by the board
the firm â¢will be enabled to blast and
<-rush rock at the locality named de
spite the protests of the surrounding
icsidents.
In his vetoes the Mayor states that
his principal reasons for returning the
ordinances without his approval were
that their enactment would cripple
building operations and cause added
expense to contractors, builders and
property owners in matters of build
ing and street paving; would drive
the rock crushing industry into ad
joining counties and thus throw a
considerable number of San Francisco
citizens outfcof employment, besides
adding greagpto the cost of the ma
terial obtained from the rock quar
ries.
The ordinances, he states, are aim
ed avowedly and directly at the work
of Gray Bros, on Thirtieth street, be
tween Castro and Diamond, and if
passed would destroy the business
that firm has established at consider
able expense. Gray Bros, have al
ready been driven from Twenty-sixth
and Douglass streets' by ordinance and
resolution making It unlawful to op
erate their plant inside of Thirtieth
Ftreet On the faith of the newly es
tablished limits they established their
plant outside of the prescribed dis
trict and, unless absolute public in
jury is shown, it would be serious in
justice, to compel them to undergo a
second loss at this time. Then the
Jlaj'or says:
1 believe that Gray Bros, should be given
a chance to show whether thÂ«y can operate,
Â«fi they claim, without Injury to or deprecia
tion of neighboring property, and as, they are
â willing to take the risk of loss in case they
do not UvÂ£ up to their promises, and as in
the meantime no one will eustaln Injury that
cannot at -once be remedied. I deem it fair
to them and unjust to nobody to -veto such
ordinance. .. _. u

HARBOR BOARD
ACTS UNJUSTLY
Judge Seawell Says Commis
sioners Misuse Power in
Giving Privilege to Kooney
The action of the Board of State
Harbor Commissioners in awarding to
John F. Rooney, brother-in-law of
Charles Spear, president of the com
mission, the privilege of conducting
the news stand in the ferry building,
notwithstanding that the firm of Fos
ter & Orear, who for ten years have
enjoyed the privilege, offered a high
er sum, was an unjust one and an
abuse of its power in the opinion of
Judge Seawell. He has therefore is
sued an injunction restraining Rooney
from taking possession of the prem
ises and preventing the board from
awarding the privilege to him. The
opinion was rendered on a demurrer
filed by the board to Foster & Orear's
petition for an injunction. The de
murrer was overruled.
By overruling the demurrer Judge
Seawell practically ends the case, so
far as the present action is concerned,
though the board has ten days to an
swer the suit Concerning the power
of the board to award the privilege
Judge Seawell says:
The power to srant the prl\'ilege In question
is by law vested exclusively in the Board of State
Harbor Commissioners. There Is no provision
of law requiring the board in granting such a
pn\ liege to advertise for bids or to award it to
the highest bidder. The exercise of such
power is entirely within the discretion of that
body. That discretion, however. Is what is
known as a sound and legal discretion, which
excludes arbitrary, capricious and corrupt ac
tion and such as prompted by Improper mo
tives. It doee not imply unlimited license to
an officer charged with Its exercise to do as
he pleases. He is elmply an agent of the law
and for a lawful purpose, and is required to
exercise his discretion fairly, reasonably and
honestly, and not for his own purpose, regard
less of the interests of the public.
Assuming, as. I must for the purposes of this
motion, that the allegations of the complaint
are true, it is Impossible to reach any other
conclusion than that the purpose of the ma
jority of the Board of State Harbor Commis
sioners in awarding to John F. Kooney the
privilege in question was. to favor a particular
person ar.J not to serve the interests of the
public, that the board has therefore failed to
cxercire the sound and legal discretion which
the law requires, and that in the interest of
the public It Is the duty of the court to re
strain the threatened action of the board.
It 1s claimed en the part of the defendants
that the board has already acted by awarding
the privilege to Rooney and that an Injunction
cannot therefore issue. The complaint alleges,
however, that Rooney has made no bid what
ever and has : not In any manner obligated
himself to accept the award or pay the rental
fixed by tbe board. I" the allegations of the
complaint are true, he has as jet acquired no
right to the privilege awarded him.

H.-MAXIM IS A LITTLE GUN,
BUT HAS VARIABLE RECORD
Commandeers a Turkey Longer Than Himself and Carries
the Weight Until Overtaken â Washington's, Birthday
Causes Reckless Agnes McCue to Become Cannibal
H. Maxim Is diminutive, but soaked
to the rail with the spirit of un
righteousness. Three terms has he done
In San Quentin for grand larceny.
Thursday night he was walking along
Washington street and spied a large
and juicy turkey hanging gracefully
from a hook in front of /the poultry
store of G. Branchi, at 533 Washington
street.
Maxim copped the "bold" and did a
hundred-yard sprint with It under
eleven seconds. Fleet-footed Policeman
Pat McGee overtook him â¢ in the last
three yards and broke the tape first.
Then he took Maxim to the City Prison
and also arrested the turkey. The
prison officials measured Maxim and
then tried the Bertillon system on the
turkey. Maxim measured seven inches
less than the stolen turkey, but weighed
three pounds more. The turkey could
not be identified as having done time
before, but the story of Maxim's life
was written largely in the records of
the identification bureau.
Judge Conlan sentenced the little fel
low yesterday to a five-month sojourn
in the County Jail. The corpus delicti in
the shape of a huge bird, that would
feed a hotel In time of need, hung
gracefully over Clerk Jack Rice's desk
and he tried to cram it into a drawer,
but the property clerk beat him to it
and returned the turkey to its rightful
owner.
' Agnes McCue celebrated Wash
ington's birthday. . When she woke up
Tuesday morning she had a holdover.
More booze and a tangled trail carried
her over until Thursday night, when
she made her appearance on the Bar
bary Coast.
About' midnight she became repent
ant and started for home on board a
yellow car that was guaranteed to
carry her out to her lodging, in the Mis
sion. When James Donahue, the con
ductor, tried to collect her fare she de
veloped a refined taste for his ear and
tried to bite off that useful member.
The motorman came to his rescue, but
all ears looked alike to Agnes. She
wanted the motorman's .ear, and suc
ceeded in biting off a corner of it before
Policeman McPhee arrived on the
scene.
Then the policeman's ear looked good
to her and she made a desperate at
tempt to secure the aural app^idage of
the officer of the law. When she ar
rived at the City Prison Sergeant Me
lody and his staff were attired in ear
muffs for self-protection.
Miss McCue was sentenced to three
months in the County Jail by Judge
Cabaniss for disturbing the peace. The
charge of cannibalism was not pressed
against her.
Charles Liebsher will not get his
presents back. That was the judgment
rendered by Judge Conlan yesterday.
Formerly Liebsher had been married,
and he gave the icefloe to his wife in
favor of Miss Elizabeth Painter, who
does not paint. In addition he gave
her sundry presents of satsumaware, sil
ver and a mahogany cabinet In which
to hold these precious goods.
Besides there were 45-cent neckties,
silk mufflers somewhat used, muslin
FLETCHER APPEARS IN
COURT AND "PAYS FIXE
Last Scene Is Enacted in the Unsuc
cessful Attack on the Constitution
ality of Cemetery Ordinance.
The final scene in the attack made
upon the constitutionality of the ordi
nance prohibiting the interment of
bodies in any cemetery within the
confines of this city and county was
enacted" yesterday when George R.
Fletcher, ex-superintendent of the
Odd Fellows' Cemetery, came into Po
lice Judge Cabaniss' court and paid
the fine of $100 imposed upon him
for violating the ordinance.
Fletcher was arrested August 31,
1901, convicted a few days later and
fined $100. He appealed to the Su
perior Court September 23, but was
unsuccessful, and April 22, 1902, the
remittitur affirming the judgment of
the lower court was received. Fletcher
surrendered himself into custody and
was taken before the Supreme Court
on a writ of habeas corpus. The writ
â was dismissed and the prisoner re
ir.anded into the custody of the
Sheriff.
A Remarkable Issue.
Nearly every paper of any note In the State
of California has taken up the fight for the
poor flower sellers who have made San Fran
cisco beautiful, but It has remained lor the
News Letter of thie week to give' the real
reason why they were clubbed away from the
Chronicle corner. Incidentally this fearless
paper puts in a strong plea for the establish
ment of the free flower markets.
Governor Pardee is asked some very pertinent
questions regarding the Harbor Commission
and its strange doings. Park Commissioner
Lloyd comes In for a share of blame for the
issuance of an order that all men over forty
years of age be discharged. Hearst Is flayed
because of his unique comparison of himself
with Lincoln and many other great men.
Of especial interest Is the Foreign Affairs
article, and at this particular juncture any
thing like an unbiased view of the Russo-
Japanese war should be of value to all readers.
The departments are bright and readable,
and as usual the theatrical criticism Is caustic
and truthful. Fitzgerald Murphy, the drama
tirer of Wagner's immortal play, has written
an article for the News Letter which will give
the public a far clearer Idea of the great mu
sical cempaser's motifs than anything hereto
fore written.
The Insurance and financial columns have
the usual reliable quota of news and com
ments, and the News Letter, as the recognized
mouthpiece of automobiling enthusiasts, has a
department devoted to this, great and useful
sport that is not equaled by any newspaper In
the Wept.
Junlus, In one of his interesting letters calcu
lated to make politicians squirm, tells us all
about the available legislative timber. Buy a
News Letter; there Is sure to be something in
it that will repay the investment. â¢

in his protest that "to restrict in this
city what is allowed in New York,

Wade W. Copenhaven, the Washing
ton State farmer who sold his ranch in
order to become a histrionic light at the
behest of a man named Stanton, is tell
ing- his story of a separation from $1500
to Judge Cabaniss. The defendant is
Ben Michaels, who . may or may not
have been implicated in the divorce
proceeding between Copenhaven and
his hefty roll. Both agree that Stanton
got the mazuma, and Michaels claims
that he contributed $1500 to the same
account. Â»
Michaels was formerly on /rial be

Superior Court in bonds of $2000. Judge
Cook dismissed him on a writ of habeas

tumbled into a pile of hay therein. He
didn't steal anything except the slum

honest. The Judge was inclined to dis
miss the defendant, but continued his

Mrs. Sarah Rogers, more familiarly
known to the public as the widow of
"Duxie" Rosenbaum, who killed him

charge that Mrs. Rogers had attempted

DETECTIVES FIND CHASE'S
VALUABLES IX HIS ROOM
Guest at Occidental Claims He Was
Robbed, but Soon Realizes His
Fears Are Groundless.
John D.' Chase, a recent arrival from
Manila, where he holds an important
position in "the Government service,
created considerable excitement at the
Occidental Hotel yesterday morning
when he publicly declared that he
had been robbed and intimated strong
ly that the- -bellboy was the guilty per
son.
i Chase reached this city several days
ago and has been staying at the Occi
dental. Thursday evening he decided
to see some of the sights of the city
and engaged a bellboy to serve him
as guide and companion on his
rounds. He and the boy parted at an
early hour yesterday morning, Chase
returning to his room at the hotel.
Later in the day he reported fo the
hotel management that his wallet,
containing. $700 and letters of credit
for twice that amount, was missing,
and after telling of his previous
night's experience he suggested that
the only solution of the mysterious
disappearance of his valuables might
be obtained In the arrest of the bell
boy. :
The management of the Occidental
finally called in detectives, who list
ened to Chase's story . and then pa
tiently awaited the arrival of the bell
boy,-who, unfortunately, had over
slept himself in the morning and was
late in reporting at the hotel. When
taken in charge by the detectives the
boy told in a straightforward manner
his experiences with Chase the night
before, and then the detectives ad
journed to the Manila man's room,
where a search brought to light his
money and notes intact in his wallet
lying on a bureau, where he had left
them the night before.
' The detectives scored Chase for his
carelessness and hasty charges against
the bellboy and the latter got a
"roast" from the hotel manager for
being late and finally an apology from
Chase. for the unjust accusation that
had. been made against him. The in
cident then closed.

PROBES FRAUDS
AT ALMSHOUSE
Grand Jury Committee Be
gins Its Investigation
of Alleged Irregularities
POLICE COURTS NEXT
Members Want to Know
Why So* Few Convictions
Follow the Many Arrests
Like other great bodies the Grand
Jury of the^ city and county of San
Francisco moves slowly. It promises,
however, some thorough work before
the close of its seven months' term.
Yesterday's meeting was destitute- of
expected sensations. The members did
not get together in numbers sufficient
to make a quorum until nearly 4
o'clock and at 5:15 they adjourned to
meet again next Friday.
The most important matter before
the jury was the report of its Health
Department committee, which has been
investigating the alleged frauds at the
County Almshouse. Dr. Ira B. Dalzlel,
chairman of the committee, reported
that it had begun its investigation by
a visit to the Almshouse earlier in the
afternoon. The accounts had been ex
amined on the question of the short
age of $386, charged by the present su
perintendent, Frank Schmitz, against
his predecessor, "William J. Kelley.
Then the committee had measured
the barrels In which syrup and pork
has been furnished by the contractors.
These were found .tobe short, the syrup
barrels containing only thirty-two gal
lons, whereas the contractors charged
for fifty-nine and a half gallons. The
blankets said to be short in weight
were weighed and out of two dozen
lately furnished as standard five-pound
blankets only five were found that
reached that weight. The others
varied from three and a quarter to four
and a quarter pounds. Regarding the
beef furnished to the Almshouse the
committee learned from a number of
the inmates that since the publication
of the charges there had been a great
change in the quality of meat supplied
them.
The Inmates said, and beef shown
the committee by Superintendent
Schmitz confirmed their statement, that
the meat they are now getting is of
excellent quality, but they declared

After spending an hour or more In
this preliminary inquiry the committee
had hurried away to the meeting of
the Grand Jury, promising to reutrn
again in a few days and resume the
investigation.
TO INVESTIGATE COURTS.
One of the matters the Grand Jury
purposes overhauling with great thor
oughness is the frequent miscarriage
of justice in the Police Courts. That
there is abundant room for an Inquiry
fn this direction is well known and
the jury infends to go to the bottom
of the abuses that have long made the
procedure in these courts a farce. The
jury wants, to find out why so small
a proportion of the arrests by the po
lice is followed by convictions in the
courts.
The jurors are in possession of infor
mation which convinces them that in
the main the police are doing their duty
in the matter of arrests, but that their
efforts to preserve order on the Barbary
Coast and in other troublesome dis
tricts are nullified by the refusal of the
Police Judges to hold the offenders, or
their practice of discharging them with
trivial fines. Thus persons arrested on
indisputable evidence of conducting
lotteries have been released on the pay
ment of a $5 fine, which is far less cost
ly to them 'than a stated license fee
would be.
The jury regards this condition of the
courts as utterly subversive of Justice,
because it discourages faithful officers
to discover that men whom they arrest
are able through the exercise of po
litical pull or the employment ol fa
vored attorneys to escape punishment.
If the Grand Jury can give the Police
Courts a real shaking up that will re
sult in a reform it will deserve and
have the support of all except the crim
inal element of the city.
INDORSES FLOWER MARKET
The Grand Jury discussed at some
length the action of the Board of'Pub
lic Works in removing the flower ven
ders at the corner of Market and
Kearny streets. After a general expres
sion of opinion a resolution was adopt
ed favoring the ordinance presented to
the Board of Supervisors by the Mer
chants' Association providing for the
establishment of a number of regular
flower markets at prominent points In
the city. Foreman Max L. Rosenfeld
said after the adjournment that the
sentiment of the members was unan
imously in favor of the open-air flower
marts, as they deemed them the best
I possible advertisement of the floral re-
I sources ai the State, as well as an at-
I tractive feature in the decoration of
San Francisco's streets.
The Grand Jury also purposes taking
â  up the Sproat case at an early date,
{ giving it a careful Investigation. This
j is demanded by many members of the
j business community.
DRIVER LOSES CONTROL
OF A ! FOUR-HORSE TEAM

nard Street With Fatal Result
to Valuable Animal.
David Rellly, a teamster for the
Pacific P'ne Company, Third and
Berry streets, was driving a wagon
load of lumber yesterday down' the
steep grade on Bernard street. Four
horses were attached to the -wagon
j and Reilly lost control of them. There
j is no outlet to the street, -which is off
Taylor street, between Pacific
I Broadway, and Reilly, fearing a se
! rious accident, jumped off the wagon
I and escaped injury. The horses
{struck the fence at the end of the
street with" terrific force and were
thrown to the ground.
The loade*d wagon crushed the two
.-wheelers so badly that one had to be
sho^and the other taken to a veteri
nary' surgeon. The two leaders es
caped with slight injury. A lamp
post near the fence was also demol
ished.
