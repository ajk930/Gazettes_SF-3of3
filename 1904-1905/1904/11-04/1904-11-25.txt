The San Francisco Call.doctor's leaving some one pressed Into
his hand an oval metal with Arabic
characters. He was asked for his card
and gave a plain card, 1 without any ad
dress, and passed on.
â¢ One month ago he was handed a let
ter containing a clipping from a West
ern evening paper, calling the attention
of one Dr. C. A. Flower to the fact
that if he would call at the East Indian
headquarters in St. , Louis and bring
with him the talisman which had been
given him in Chicago many years ago
it would be to his good. Last week Dr.
Flower found the" Rajah In/St, Louis.
He had the medal and when he showed
It the attendants prostrated themselves.

that the Hindoo lad whom he had res
cued in Chicago was now the Rajah
Tipo Sahib, and: that he wished to be
remembered. He Â¦ had- sent presents " to
the .value of about 110,000 'to the physi

criticism here of the State Depart

uttered a respectful protest against the
assumption of the larger name. Sir Ed
ward proceeded. to refer to the miser
able underpayment of American judges
and America's waste of energies in pro
viding for survivors of the Civil War
and in building . ironclads t which she
would never use.
Ambassador Choate. replying, said
that Americans were quite satisfied
with their name and then referred to
the recent election in the United States
as a splendid tribute to a great man.
Having remarked upon the regenera
tion of public lif e - in "America regard

ever-growing friendship between Great
Britain and America as a reason- for
Thanksgiving, and added: "I asked
Lord; Lansdowne if ;he was, ready to
negotiate a treaty of arbitration.
"/'.Why,' said Lord Lan3downe, 'it
goes -without saying.' "
Continuing, Choate maintained that
many . things Â¦ go without saying be
tween Great Britain ; and " the United
States; above all, that they should avoid
all possible causes of offense and settle
their differences r by peaceful means.
He paid a ; high tribute to : the Arch
bishop of Canterbury's "rediscovery "of
America" :and dilated- upon- the value
of visits to .America by such men as
the Archbishop and John Morley.
The J Archbishop/ of Canterbury, pro
posing President Roosevelt's healthy ex
pressed sincere thanks for the great
hospitality with' which he was received
In America.- He said; America' faced

He was indeed a good as well as a

a devotion inseparable from a_n equal
devotion to the welfare of humanity

through whom God hath wrought great
things. In four years of office he freed
Cuba and established Its. government
in independence; he made a way f in

he established in Asiatic affairs.a policy

NEW EPOCH IX OUR HISTORY.
' So great a change in the relations of
the United States to the rest of the
world marked nothing less than the be
ginning of a new epoch in our history,
and our politics, both domestic and for
eign, will be forevermore affected/by it.
All experience teaches that when an
old order of things terminates and a
new order begins the factor of supreme
importance in determining the course
of political events is the personal char
acter of the dominant leader of the
time. .The course of the commonwealth
of England after the war between Par
liament arid King Charles would have
been widely different had Oliver Crom
well fallen in battle Instead of John
Hampden; the French revolution would
have had another issue had Robespierre
died in the early days of the revolt in
stead of jMirabeau; we all know how
much of- the success of our republic is
due to the fact that at the foundation
of the Union it had the leadership of
Washington; we know how priceless to
the side of the Union during -the -days
of the Civil War was the personal in
fluence" of Lincoirii Even so shall we
recognize the high good fortune that is
ours in having had during^the Spanish
war and at the beginning of our colo
nial expansion the guidance, the influ
ence and the inspiration of the leader
ship of William McKinley.
For the right performance of the du
ties imposed upon him by the emer
gency of the war and its consequences
the man was so well fitted by nature
and by training that it seems almost as
if he had been prepared for the work
by a direct act of Providence. He had
lived his youth in times when the stress
and strain of the most tremendous civil
war in modern history tried men's souls
to the uttermost. He passed at 17 years
of age from school into the army, and
there, amid a million valiant men, so
distinguished himself that despite his
youth he rose rapidly to high rank on
the staff of his commanding general,
winning promotion by faithful service
and by gallantry on the field of battle.
With the close of the war he entered
political life and ' was elected seven
times Representative in Congress and
twice Governor of Ohio before his ele
vation to the Presidency. So from first
to last his course was steadily upward;
there were no accidents in his career;
he atained the chief magistracy of the
republic untrammeled by promises or
pledges, becoming in the dullest sense
of the words the free leader of a free
people.
HIS PERSOXAIi CHARACTER.
Through the whole course of his pub
lic life he was noted for a singular
sweetness of disposition and courtesy
of manner. He had-in a high degree
the fine faculty of making and retain
ing friendships strong enough to with
stand all the friction: of party strifes
and of individual ambitions. His charm
was something more, than the attrac-r,
tlon of a -personal magnetism.". It was
the rich perfume of. the flower of a
chivalrous and sympathetic manhood.
His nature was full and fine In all the
faculties and graces of | the affections;
his- tenderness for - his wife shone out'
over the Â¦ whole ; land and will be , long
remembered as one of the most beauti
ful love stories in the annals of his
tory; while his wider sympathies em
braced within their scope of genuine
friendliness, everv ; degree and kind of
men with whom he had any dealings
whatever, and seem to have been In
spired always by that touch of nature
that makes the whole world kin.
- Such was the man whom the votes
of the people had' placed at the head
of > the republic when, in the resistless
march of events, " necessity compellea
this country to destroy the last ves
tiges of Spanish empire in America and
in v Asia, and to- provide governments
for the various peoples thus released
from their . ancient rule. ~ Every great
faculty- of his . nature was Â¦ summoned
to great action by the issues that con
fronted him. Well was, It then . for
him, for ua and for the liberated peo
ples of the redeemed i islands, that > he
had . so worthily lived and so .unselfish
ly worked throughout his entire life,
that at this juncture' he, had the -full
confidence of his countrymen and their
full ' support in the performance I of ; the
mighty task before him. That, confi
dence could not have been given to one
legs noble. than himself, and without it
the issues resulting from the war might
have been involved in partisan. politics
to disturb the country for : years and
Ippvc a direful heritage for future gen
erations. siBSBBSflBKwtflH
The- influence of his personal char

and steadiness with * which agitators

sculpture, but also to awaken the con
cious spirit to high ideals of public ser
vice and of private life. Therefore,
whenever a new monument of a noble
sort is i added to the city, we should
rejoice and give honor to those to
whose liberality and civic patriotism it
is due.
For this monument which we have
assembled to dedicate the city is in
debted primarily to a spontaneous im
pulse of. the whole people. So dear was
William McKinley to their hearts, so
near was he to their patriotism . and
their pride, that when his death came
so untimely and in. a fasl.ioti so dread
ful, the emotions of the mass burst
forth in a well nigh universal demand
for the erection of a monument which
would bear witness to their love for
hfm as a man and to the honor in
.which they hold his high service to the
republic.
ALL CLASSES EAGER TO GIVE.
The intensity cf the* feeling prompted
the people to action without waiting for
organization. Contributions for the de
sired monument poured in. from all
sides upon the city authorities and
the newspapers, so that a considerable
sum was donated before even so much
as a committee had been appointed to
take charge of it. Affer the appoint
ment the contributions increased rap-
Idly in number and in magnitude. Some
of them were given in sums so large
and with such munificence of liber
ality that any community might justly
be proud of having citizens capable of
such splendid giving; but as the con
tributions came from all classes and as
the laborer gave of his earnings as
generously as the millionaire of his
fortune, it would be invidious to select
any for special praise. Let it suffice
to say that Avithin a space of hardly
more than three months, â¢ without re
sort to any indecorous means' of rais
ing money, almost -without even the
form of canvassing, there was donated
a sum of more" than thirty " thousand
dollars by the free, prompt giving of a
patriotic people. That is a record in
which the city and its citizens can have
a juster pride than if the whole sum, or
ten times the sum, had been given by a
single millionaire. .
Recognizing the full value of the
spontaneous offerings of the people,
let us not forget to give due honor and
praise to the members of the executive
committee, who organized the work
and carried it forward- in a well or
dered way with such efficiency of ac
tion and such excellerice of artistic
judgment as to provide for us the
noble monument we are now to dedi
cate.
One further fact in the story of this
memorial touches our local pride. and
adds to our gratification. The monu
ment is the work of a San Francisco
sculptor, a native of the city, an artist
whose .original genius germinated,
blossomed and bore fruit under Cali
fornia skies, without the aid of for
eign training or inspiration. Surely
then we may look upon this new orna
ment of our city with a glow of Just
and genuine satisfaction, for from first
to .last it Is an outcome of our crea
tive' faculties and self-directed ener
gies. It is a city of our own making
that is growing up in magnitude and
in . magnificence around us. Â¦ It was
founded by the enterprise of â¢ our
fathers; we are advancing it by. our
industry and adorning It through the
impulses of . our patriotism by . the
at tit= tic triumphs of our native genius.
Far beyond the reach of local pride,,
far above the height of local patriot- :
ism, are the reaches and the heights
to which our minds are carried and
lifted by the memory of the great
statesman whose fame and service this
memorial is designed to commemor
ate; yet even in his story there are In
cidents that touch us closely. We re
call: that he dwelt for a while. in our
city, looked into our eyes, grasped our
hands, felt his heart beat responsive
to our love, spoke in warm com
mendation, of our achievements and
gave utterance to lofty and splendid
prophecies of our future greatness.
We remember that his hand 4 turned
the turf for the foundation of the
monument that stands in the heart of
the city to commemorate Dewey's
great victory in Manila Bay and that
it was his friend and colleague, an
other President of the United States,.
Theodore Roosevelt, who in ; his turn
broke the ground for this monument.
Thus we have local recollections to
bring his* personal influence near.; to
us and to give something of tender
ness. to the feeling with which we re
call the far-off greatness of his work
and the sublime heights of his illus
trious career.
WROUGHT WORLD DESTINIES.
It is most appropriate, from- the
point of view of the larger history of
the.wor.ld that he should have laid. in
this city the foundation of the me-'
mortal of the victory . In Manila Bay,'
for despite his many services- in'; our
domestic politics he will, be .remem
bered, by future generations .chiefly
because of hia connection with the
war In which .that victory was won; a
war* in which his personality as the
leader of the American 'people exerted
an Influence so potent as. to .'affect' the
destinies not of this country, only, but
of the whole .world. . - : .
William McKinley became President
of the United States at a period when
forces, unnoted but irresistible, . were
about to readjust the balance 'of " the'
powers of -the earth * and change the
front of this republic from the At
lantic to the ; Pacific. When the war
against Spain broke* out .no onei looked
for the acquirement . of any area of
conquered territory. It was absolutely

martyr President builded much in
statesmanship to strengthen the' re
public and make the blessings of its
Government greater still. A mantle
hangs over the back from the should
ers of the figure and the proud head is
held high, but the features express
sadness â the sense of grief embodied
in the typixk-ation.
Besides symbolizing peace after vic
tory, with the strength of the republic
to maintain it. the palm leaf held forth
in the attitude of determination ex
presses a tribute to the success of the
work of President McKinley In guid
ing the affairs of the nation in war
as well as in peace. The left hand is
on the sword that is held to the side,
victorious from a war and always
ready to defend the republic, but In a
position of disinclination for conflict.
The foundation of the monument is
massive and of granite, as is also the
pedestal. In every way there is ex
pression of strength and power, the
figure of the "Republic" being the
most marked of all. The life work
of. McKinley is 'most happily
taught in its most powerful
aspects. That is the most im
portant feature to mankind of the man
and his personality is submerged in
teaching the lesson of the great good
he accomplished for fellow men. The
sculptor has brought this point out
strongly in representing so forcibly
that which the life of McKinley exem
plified.
AITKEX'S IDEA.
The departure from the monument,
customarily consisting of modeling of
the figure of the man himself, was
urged by Aitkei/and accepted by the
committee. The only portrayal*of Mc-
Kinley in the person is a medallion
carved in the front of the pedestal. On
either side are marked the years of his
birth and death. 1843 and 1901, and be
neath his name is inscribed in the
granite. On another Fide of the
pedestal is the inscription: "This
monument was erected by the people
of San Francisco, A. D. 1904." On
the third side appears: "Ground for
this monument was broken by Presi
dent Roosevelt May 13, 1903."
It was shortly after 2 o'clock that
the cords were loosed and the covering
of the monument was allowed to fall.
The great audience that former Mayor
James D. Pholan, chairman of the
monument committee, had Just called
to order was moved to applause at the
inspiring spectacle as the majestic
figure was unveiled. With Chairman
Fhelan on the platform erected about
the base of the monument were the
other members of the executive com
mittee â Messrs. William Greer Har
rison. H. U. Brandenstein, E>. J.

MR. PHELAN'S ADDRESS.
Chairman Phelan's address was as
follows:
LediÂ»>9 and Gentlemen: We come -here to
day iÂ» honor a great name in our country's
Alston'. The patriotic people of San Kran-
< T .-Â»Â»i4 Vnrv#> Â»r<H-tP<l a monument in memory of
President William McKinley, and we are here
to unveil it. You will remembr the visit of
the Presidf-nt to this city In May, 1901 â how
he was received by our people with cplendid
enthusiasm and bow he graciously participated
in Â«>ntÂ«Tta!nmentÂ» and ceremonial* arranged
for him by hla Cabinet. His sojourn among
w having been prolonged by the !Ilne*s of hla
Â¦wif*. the pporl"* learned to love him and ap
preciate the virtue* and patriotism which sig
nalize! hie life; and. when hÂ«s departed from
our o!ty you all know that he bore toward It
the most kindly feelings, which he frequently
exj>rÂ«*Md.
Within four months after his visit to our
coa*t he vi> cruelly slain. The citizens of San
Francisco, rhocked beyond expmvlon. In their
profound gri*f and awakened : patriotism held
memorial exerdres on the day of hia funeral
San Francisco's majestic and inspir
ing monument to the immortal Wil
liam MTKinley.
I and resolved at that time to erect a monu
j ment to his memory in order that the teach
ings of hia life and death might not be lost to
future generations and that the people might
te reminded tor all time of his love of coun
try, his public services and his martyrdom. A
committee was appointed, popular subscrip
tions Invited and over $30,000 was collected in
a very short time.
The work of the committee Is now accom
plished. The monument you see before you in
the work of a native sculptor and the bronze
was cast in one of our own foundries.
The heroic figure typifies the republic. One
haud reets upon the sword which has Just been
put down, the war of the President's admin
istration having; been honorably closed, and in
her ru:ht hand she holds aloft a palm branch,
eymbclicai of peace following victory. The
palm is as well a tribute to the statesmanship
of the President, who brought the country
safely through one of the most trying periods
of its national existence. The ancient saying
has it "'Who earns the palm, let him bear it."
But short was the time allotted to our sol
dier-statesman to bear the honors of his tri
umph and the reward of his deVotlon.
So this figure of the republic, majestic in
its wisdom and strength, endowed seemingly
with the power to confer honors and rewards,
)h now grief-stricken in the pre^nce of the
I King of Terrors, .which no earthly power can
overcome. You will so* that sadness rests upon
her face and tears suffuse her eyes. She ii
the picture of a mother Inconsolable. Power
j less to Â«ave her son. Â«>he can but show her
grief while she murmurs his praise.
The sculptor has done an admirable work, â¢
and now 1 have the honor, on behalf of the ;
committee, to present this monument to the
city of San Francisco and commit it to the
care of the honorable the Board of Park Com.
mUsioners.
MAYOR ACCEITS MONUMENT.
After a selection by the band Mayor
Eugene E. Schmltz was called. In the
name of the municipality he made ac
ceptance of the monument and prom
ised that the city's government, and
particularly, the Board erf Parfc Com
missioners, would for all time preserve
with loving care the tribute to the
memory of the illustrious President,
that it may teach the lesson of noble
manhood.
"With deepest feelings of apprecia
tion of the worth of William McKinley
as a worker for great good in our na
tion and as the typification of purity
in private and public life," said the
Mayor, "as a meager expression of
friendship entertained by. us for. one
whose kindly interest was many times
shown us, I accept this magnificent
monument from you on behalf of the
people of San Francisco., Set at the
very gate of our great park, almost
in the very center of the city, where
the lesson it has to teach may be im
pressed on the greatest number of our
people, may it ever evoke the vivid rec
ollection of the kindly life, the exalted
abilities and the lofty patriotism of
our beloved President. William McKin
ley. May this monument for all time
stand to symbolize nobility of man
hood." Â¦ '
Representing the Golden Gate Park
Commission, of which he is a member,
Reuben H. Lloyd undertook the imme
diate care of the monument and ex
pressed a hap^y appreciation of the
decision of the committee to place It at
the entrance of the park.
1 AN ADMIRABLE SITE.
"The commission has long desired
that there should be some marked fea
ture at the entrance to the panhandle,"
said Mr. Lloyd, "and the committee's
decision to follow the suggestion that
it be erected on this spot gave us much
satisfaction. We believe It a most ap
propriate selection of a site. Our park
is approaching the rank of the grand
est parks in the world and in time
it will be one of the brightest beauty
spots on the face of the earth. With
our equable climate every tree and
shrub and flower can be grown In
Golden Gate Park, and if the policy
of the present commission shall be
carried out In the future, as I believe
it will, every tree, shrub' and flower
found anywhere on the globe will be
nourishing here with us. ".-..;. "
"And what better inspiration could
confront the visitor to the park than
a monument to the man who. lived for
his God, his country and his fellow
men. How better could the visitor be
stirred than seeing symbolized the life
of one of the greatest and grandest
statesmen the world has ever known.
"This monument, stands as well a
tribute to the good citizenship and lib*
erality of those who contributed the
$20,000 toward the building of it. When
the movement was organized for the
undertaking a man was chosen as the
chairman of the committee who is al
ways to be found among those ready
to help out financially . and with his
labor in the beautifying and Improve
ment of our "city. May this monument
through all the centuries be an Incen
tive to young men to study and there
by be uplifted by the, noble life of the
Illustrious McKinley." '
31 H. McXAUGIITS ORATION.
Again there was music and more ap
plause, after which â¢ John McNaught
.was introduced to deliver the oration.
He SDokeas follows : :
Of old It was said, "Man. never works
so like a god -as* in = the â¢ building of a
city." The saying derives its value from
the fact that in building a. city man
bends the crude materials and rude
..forces of nature .to. his. .will .and
makes for himself a dwelling place fit
ted for the delight of his mind, as well
as for the comforts of his body. A well
built city^is a realization of human
ideas, through the exercise of human !
energies, and is so distinctly an arti
ficial thing that the builders of it may
not unreasonably be deemed to have
exerted something of . a genuine cre
ative power.' .'â¢Â¦-; -
Each citizen should, In proportion to
his means, strive to have his city
adorned with every structure that
tend3 to the -maintenance of .the high
est civilization and to the uplifting of
the mind In Joy, admiration* and '.rev
erence. Among such adornments none
fills a worthier, place than those design
ed to commemorate' great events or: the
services of illustrious 7 men, for they

nish its auota of volunteers to follow
the flag to battle and carry" it to vic
tory.
Chiefly, however, the value of his in
fluence was shown when the time came
to solve the problems . of the Philip
pines. No other statesman could have
led the people of the Unit.ed States to
agree so nearly unanimously in the an
nexation of those far. off islands and
the acceptance of the responsibilities of
their government.. He led us safely
into this path because he made it clear
to us that it is the right path; that for
America, empire does not mean impe
rialism; that there can be an expan
sion of liberty as well as an expansion
of despotism: and that, when the stars
and stripes are carried across the seas
they take with them every guarantee
of present good and future hope that
they have held out to humanity since
first they were unfurled in the cause of
freedom bv the hand of Washington.
Like all great men, McKinley be
lieved the duties of life are decreed
for "us by an overruling providence,
and that in its highest sense history
is nothing less than the record of
God's dealing with mankind. Over
and over again, while the issue was as
yet undecided in the public mind, did
he impress upon the people that the
establishment of order in the Philip
pines is a duty which under divine di
rection we owe to humanity even
more than to ourselves. Once he
said: "Wherever we have raised our
flag we have raised it not for con
quest, not for territorial aggrandize
ment, not for national gain, but for
civilization and humanity." On an
other occasion he said: "Porto Rico
and the Philippines have come to us
in the providence of God and we must
carry the burden, whatever it may be,
in the interest of civilization, human
ity and - liberty." So- again he '* said:
"When the A mists fade away and we
see with; clear vision, may we not go
forth rejoicing In a strength which
has been employed solely for human
ity and always tempered with justice
and mercy, confident of an ability to
meet the exigencies that await us, be
cause confident that our course is
one of duty and our cause that of
right?"
Holding these high aims ever in his
mind, and mounting steadily to ever
higherplanes of statesmanship, his in
tellectual horizon widened as he rose.
In the end he became not the leader
of a nation only, but a great master
of world politics and stood unques
tioned the foremost statesman of his
time. When the ; long* menacing
problem of China precipitated itself
upon the world by the Boxer outrages,
civilization looked to him for light and
leadership; nor did it look In vain.
His declaration of American policy
toward China not only satisfied' the
interests of the nations, but cheered
the conscience of humanity itself, and
the time may yet y come . when the
American people will uphold the Mc-
Kinley doctrine in Asia as . they up
hold the Monroe doctrine inv America,
and make it an . honored, renowned
and enduring: part of an inviolable
foreign policy.

One grain of the active principle In
Stuart's Dyspesia Tablets will digest
3000 grains of meat, eggs or other
wholesome food, and this claim has
been proven by actual experiment
which anyone can perform for himself
in the following manner: Cut hard-
boiled eggs into very small pieces, as
it would be If masticated, place tha
egg and two or three of the tablets in
a bottle or Jar containing warm water,
heated to 98 degrees (the temperature
of the body), and keep it at this tem-
perature for three and one-half hours,
at the end of which time the tgg will
be as completely digested as It would
have been in the healthy stomach of
a hungry boy.
The point of. this experiment is that
what Stuart's Dyspesia Tablets will do
to the egff in the bottle it will do to
the egg or meat in the stomach, and
nothing else will rest and invigorate
the stomach so safely and effectually.
Even a little child can take Stuart'3

digestion is weak and the thousands of
cures accomplished by their regular*
daily use are easily explained when it .
is understood that they are composed
of vegetable essences, aseptic pepsin,

stomach- a chance to recuperate.
Dieting never cures dyspepsia, neith-
er do pills and cathartic medicines,
which simply irritate and Inflame the
intestines.
When enough food is eaten and
promptly digested there win be no- con-
stipation, nor in fact will there.be dis-
ease of any kind, because good diges-
tion means good health in every organ.
The merit â¢ and success of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets are .world-wide and
they are sold at the moderate price of

Thanksgiving day fittingly ushered
in the holiday season and ' the busy
time of preparation for the near by
Christmas is at hand.
Thanksgiving dav has passed and the
people, turning their thoughts from the
fortunes cf the year that is gone, look
again toward the future with renewed
hope. It is well to pause once each
twelvemonth and survey the vanished
days that stretch behind and weigh the
blessings that have fallen within their
period. It is then that the mind is
cleared of doubt, ambition is stimu
lated, the world moves on with In
creased energy and benefits to man
kind accrue.
In nearly all of the churches of the
city services were held yesterday.
Ministers spoke of the favors that hare
been showered upon the American peo
ple by Divine Providence. _ Organs
pealed out the melodies of thanksgiv
ing anft voices were raised in songs
of praUe. Large congregations at
tended these services and contributed
liberally at the offertories that the
cause of charity might be enriched.
And. as is the custom in San Fran
cisco, the sick, the aged, the unfor
tunate little ones and the poor were
not forgotten. Dinners were sent to
those unable to buy them and young
sters whese parents could 111 afford the
luxury of a Thanksgiving dinner were
dined and lavishly entertained.
The spirit of charity was abroad and
If there were any that did not pax
take of its good cheer it was because
they were unworthy. Even the pris
c-ners in the jails did not go without
the good things of the season, which
were freely distributed, and for the
hour the iron bars and the Iron bolts
were forgotten.
_ And the Sisters of the Holy Fam
ily" are already working for another
merry hour for the children on Christ
mas day. There will be a feast and
a tree that will hold a present for
each of the youngsters. And the best
of all ts that Christmas Is not far
away, so youthful patience win not
be too sorely tested waiting for Santa
Claus to call them to their fan.
It was a glad feast. Pretty girls by
the score hurried around the tables
wielding the keen carvers and secins
that every tiny guest was well sup
plied. For an hour these youngsters
dined and laughed. When the last had
cried enough their hands and pockets
were stuffed with fruit and they were
shooed out into the yard, where they
romped and told one another of
the wonders of the banquet.
It was a wholesome sight to watch
them at their contented play and to
know that the spirit of charity Is ever
ready at holiday times to bring hap
piness to young lives that, without it.
would be filled with darkness and the
despair of disappointment that- only
the child mind can know.
And yesterday, as has Ions: been the
custom of the sisters, their young
charges were feasted in honor of
Tban-ksgivlng day. When the littla
ones marched into the five large halls
where the tables were spread they
clapped their chubby hands in de
light. Long rows of wen-browned tur
keys, puddings, pies and fruit â the
same as may be found on the holiday
tables of the richâ were there to glad
den them. And everywhere Rowers
were banked and ferns were placed,
while the stars and stripes lent a
touch of cheerful, patriotic color.
A beautiful act of charity was per
formed by the good Sisters of the Holy
Family at their convent. Hayes and
Fillmore streets, yesterday afternoon.
Seven hundred little children rrert
their guests at a Thanksgiving dinner
that carried more cheer to their young
hearts than even the hope of a near
visit from Santa Claus.
These hundreds of little gue3ts ar
the children of toning mothers that
are compelled during their hours of
employment to give their little ones
into the charge of the sisters. All day
long these youngsters are cared for
at the Sacred Heart Hone, 13) Haye*
street, the SL Francis Home. H13 Pow
ell street, and the Home of the Holy
Family. 4Â» Sfxth street.

There are scores of cases of persona
having been cured of various ailments
of the body, particularly lff&g trouble,
by coming to West Texasand leading
an open-air life on the ranches. This
Is Just what the. Southern Pacific pro
poses to encourage and direct on a
large scale. All the camp equipage,
horses, food supplies, physicians and
in fact everything needed will be pro
vided by the railroad and the traveler
will be charged only a nominal sum to
helxÂ» pay for the expenses of conduct
ing the open air sanitariums.
This project Is in the personal charge
of John T. Patrick, who is looking after
the industrial development of Texas
along the line of the Southern Pacific.
Patrick's headquarters are now at
Houston. He is busy making arrange
ments for the Inauguration of the
novel enterprise. He says that the
first caravan will probably be started
out early in January. The party to
make the Initial trip has talready been
made up. It will be headed by Dr. J.
J. Kindred of Long Island, N. T., pres
ident of the River Crest Sanitarium.
Dr. Kindred is greatly interested in the
open air sanitarium Idea and he be
lieves that the new venture of the
Southern Pacific will prove a great suc
cess.
The railroad will provide a supply
of good horses and wagons and the rec
reation and health seekers may rove
over the country in true cowboy style.
The temporary tent cities will provide

â¢ EDINBURGH. Nov. 24.â Scotch tail
ors have an American to thank for a
sudden boom in a particularly well
paying branch of their trade. Since
young Bradley Martin distinguished
himself by appearing in Highland kilts
on his wedding day, quite a number of
orders have been received by makers of
the national costume, who believe a
real revival is coming and are corre
spondingly elated.
Fashionable kilts are expensive gar
ments. .The materials employed are
costly and only skilied hands who have
served a long apprenticeship at the
work are competent to make them^ In
consequence of the .sudden "boom"
many workers in "tartans," . who for
some time have had to content them
selves with poorly paid labor. In army
clothing factories in London, - where
uniforms for the Highland regiments
are made, have crossed the Tweed
again and are finding steady employ
ment at excellent wages in the fash
ionable outfitting establishments of
Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness.
While the canny Scots openly, ridicule
the taste displayed by American Â¦' so-
Journers who Insist on arraying them
selves in Highland garb, they have a
shrewd appreciation of the money to
be made by ministering to then- folly
and . devoutly hope that next season
every American who shoots over a
Scotch moor will feel it incumbent upon
him to wear glorified kilts.
The lavish and ostentatious display
Of diamonds and other costly Jewelry
at the Bradley Martin wedding was
seized upon by some Journals, both
Scotch and English, as a text for unc
tuous discourse on the vulgarity of
wealthy Americans. It is a case of
those who live in glass houses throw
ing stones. Fashionable English wed
dings are by no means characterized by
modest simplicity. Opinions may differ
as to the taste displayed in making
elaborate semi-public exhibitions of the
wedding gifts, but there can be no
question that the custom generally fol
lowed-of-sending -to newspapers for
publication detailed descriptive cata
logues of them, often with the price of
the articles attached, is atrociously
vulgar. -Rich English folk are Just as
fond, as rich Americans of showing off
their wealth, and At the Americans
usually make the finer display it lsbe
cause they generally have the most
money. . ' Â¦â¢.,-- . . â¢ .
Literary associations of uncommon
interest surround Celbridge Abbey, the
ancient mansion In County KUdare,
Ireland, whose contents are about to be
sold at auction. It was at Celbridge
that Dean Swift's famous admirer "Va
nessa" took up her residence in order
to be near the author of "Gulliver's
Travels," and there that he viBlted
and finally parted with her. "Vanes
sa's" real name was, of course, Van
homrighâ "her only ugly feature,"
Bwift called itâ and her presence at
Celbridge Abbey must have been rather
embarrassing to the Dean of St. Pal
rick's when there was "Stella"â his
other fair friendâ Just on the other side
of the Liffey. "Vanessa'* died in 1723,
leaving directions in her will that
Swift's rhymed account . of their ro
mance should be published. In Miss
Vanhomrigh's time Celbridge Abbey
was called Marley Abbey, it having
been built by a wealthy Anglican
Bishop of that name.

Cuban officials unreservedly admit
and condemn the bad sanitary condi
tions in some of the eastern cities.
Dr. Finlay, who- has a high reputa
tion as a yellow fever expert, asserted
that there was not a single case of that
disease in Cuba. It was an impossibil
ity, he added, that half a dozen marine
hospital inspectors should have discov
ered cases which the thoroughly or
ganized health department of Cuba had
failed to discover, and more than Im
probable that they should know of such
cases and yet fall to call the attention
of the Cuban department to them.
Dr. Finlay reiterated that the only
case originating in Cubaâ more than
three years ago â was that of the Amer
ican, Scott Fuller, at Punta de Sal,
which was extremely light and of ques
tionable authenticity. Suspicion at
tached also to Fuller's attendant, but
the disease had not developed. Health
officers at all Cuban ports treat all
fever symptoms in arrivals from Carib
bean and South American ports as sus
picious, and also all others that are in
the least .Questionable. These are in
variably detained and isolated until
they die or are cured.'
Dr. Delgado, a Cuban, who is in tha
United States marine hospital service
at Havana, disclaimed any knowledge
of yellow fever cases thla year except
in six cases who arrived from Mexico
and which were immediately Isolated.
Of these, two died and the others re
covered.
HAVANA, Nov. 20.â "We challenge
the United States marine hospital service
to point out. as alleged, that several
cases of yellow fever have appeared in
various parts of Cuba," was the re
sponse of Dr. Carlos " Finlay, chief of
the department of health and sanita
tion, when shown a dispatch from
Washington to-day assigning that as a
reason for. the Instructions of the
United States to Minister Saulers to
call the attention of the Cuban Govern
ment to the unsanitary conditions at
Santiago and elsewhere in the Island
and his prompt and thorough remedy of
these conditions'.
Special Dispatch to The Call
United States District Attorney Hall
and Assistant Attorney General Henry
bent their energies to convince the Jury
by the testimony of A. W. Barber, a
clerk in the General Land Office, that
the claims in the now notorious "11-7"
district, by which homestead patents
were Issued, were never improved or
resided on by any of thÂ« claimants to
whom they were awarded, and that thÂ«
Issuance of patents was upon testi
mony false from beginning to end.
Barber was the only witness ex
amined by the Government this fore
noon. He testified that he was a prac

Into conditions there. Four men ac
companied him- They went over tha
territory In question and found an in
accessible forest. His instructions were
to examine a list of twenty-two claims
as to improvements and residence.
Barber read a list of the claims ex
amined, among which were the follow
ing names:
Harry C. Barr. Henry Young. Joseph
Wilson, Emma Porter, Maud "Witt,
George W. Pettis, George A. Graham,
Nellie Backus. Zenas K. Watson, Frank
H. Wolgamot, Thomas Wilklns, Chris

Mattle S. Lowell, Alexander R. Brown,
John F. Foster, William McLaughlln

Twelve of these claims, the prosecu
tion contends, were deeded to Emma L.
Watson, among them that of Emma
Porter, whom the Government claims
is none other than Mrs. Watson her
self.

from all the sworn testimony given by
the alleged homesteaders in making
proof.
The witness said he found that the
homestead law had not been complied
with in any respect as regards resi

UTICA, N. T., Nov. 24.â William
Rockefeller, of the Standard Oil Com
pany, who owns 53,000 acres of forest
land in the Adlrondacks, has again
aroused the Ire of the natives by en
gaging dozens of guards to patrol his
vast preserve in Great North Woods.
Several guards have been fired at dur
ing this week while watching would-be
trespassers. As smokeless powder was
used in every case all efforts to locate
and capture these "snipers" have
proved futile.
Rockefeller, with his family, Is at
present staying at his magnificent
lodge at Bay Pond. He Is bitterly op
posed to poaching and vandalism on
his premises.
The natives maintain that wild deer
cannot be bought with â¢ land, nor did
Rockefeller acquire the fish which, at
the expense of the State, had been
placed in . streams running through

do now, consider the whole thing a
trumped up plot to persecute and In
timidate innocent* men. I am deter

the real conspirators are. The idea of
the executive head of a great organiza

ridiculous. ;.= i. ';;

' It developed to-day that" another

foundry occurred at the same time
young Rauhauser was making his

The prosecution anticipates some dif
ficulty in sustaining the charges made
against President Valentine and others
in connection with the dynamite plot
from the fact that the Rauhausers,
being defendants in a criminal . case,
cannot be compelled to be witnesses,
and also because young Rauhauser haa
made statements that his confession
was obtained through coercion.

HARLEM. Mont.. Nov. 24. â A large
prairie fire has been raging for several
days forty miles north of here and
still is burning fiercely. Thousands of
acres of grazing land have been swept
over and thousands of dollars' worth
of property has been destroyed. George
Petrie, a leading sheepman, whose
range is in the devastated portion, is
reported to have lost all his hay, his
residence and all the buildings.
It is said that the fire started across
the Canadian line on Monday after
noon and during the terrific wind
storms of Tuesday and Wednesday
moved with startling rapidity over into
the American possessions, from which
all kinds of antelope, deer and other
wild animals have fled. The fire was
plainly visible to-night and the sheep
men in its path will all ..be heavy
losers, for their winter range is de
stroyed, together with all of their hay
for winter use and outbuildings.
Large numbers of men have been
fighting the flames ever since they
started, but have not been equal to the
task. There Is talk of lynching the
man who started the fire if he can be
found.

The Placer County Bank officials
have announced, that they will pay
$1000 for the recovery of the money
stolen by the bank robber last May.
The bank also offers a reward of $500
for the arrest a.nd conviction of the
thief. Many of those who believe that
Weber robbed the bank are searching
in the vicinity of the home for the
stolen money.
The story that the pistol used by the
murderer was oivned by a boy named
Armstrong, who later eoid it to Eugene
Rodehaver. the latter losing it, has
been investigated and found to be un
true. Sheriff Keena will go to San
Francisco to-morrow to continue his
search for the person, who sold the
pistol. The Sheriff believes that
Weber may have purchased the re

last June.
It is now recalled by the Snowden
family that xrhen the Webers left for
their San Francisco trip Adolph made

It is the theory of some of the resi

the purpose of getting the money
stolen from the bank and that he took
it with him and placed It in some safe
deposit vault in San Francisco. This
theory is based on the assumption
that it was Weber who held up the
bank-

credence in this theory, but may, make
an investigation. The ofUcers to-day

Squires, of the same club, says that he
looks upon a bond issue as a standing
advertisement and an announcement to
the world that a new era in Berkeley
Is about to begin. - ,
Rev. E. A. Glrvin compares Berkeley
to Brookline,. a beautiful suburb of
Boston. He declares that the beauties
of the Massachusetts suburb can be du
plicated In Berkeley,' and should be.
Speeches in similar strain , have been
made byW. W. Henry, M. L. Hanscom,
C. E. Street and other prominent "mem
bers of. the' club. 9
F. Heald of West Berkeley has in
formed the North Berkeley organiza
tion that his neighbors plan to,organlze
an Improvement club, and desire the
advice and assistance , of , the North
Berkeley men. President Robertson,
Rev. E. A. Glrvin and R- Marston have
volunteered to assist the West Berke
ley folk In the work.
It is proposed to form the joint as
sociation on lines similar to those
adopted by the Progress Federation of
Alameda County, which includes repre
sentatives - of improvement clubs, and
mercantile bodies whose Interests are
identical with those of the clubs. Juster

Warren Cheney. Moran Swain, the
Central Real Estate Company, Joseph

have Interests at stake in the matter,
favor this proposed consolidation of
clubs. A definite mode of procedure to
bring about the consolidation is now
being formulated, and is to be broached
by leading men In the movement during
ttu next fortnight.
Each of the improvement clubs of
Berkeley has placed itself on record as
favoring the Issue of bonds for munic
ipal improvements, the North Berkeley
club being the latest to express its ap
proval of the Droject.
The advantage of co-operation among
all the improvement clubs of the cityâ
the Ashby, North Berkeley, South
Berkeley and West Berkeley organiza
tions â to secure the passage of a bond
issue and to accomplish other desirable
things is now being discussed by mem
bers, and leading spirits in the organiza
tion are proposing a consolidation of
the clubs which would be effective, they
say, in the work of creating sentiment
fn favor of the proposed bond 1 issue.

"One thing is certain." writes John
G. Latham of bookkeeping as a calling,
"the bookkeeper's work has been nar
rowed down to more of a matter of rou
tine to-day than it was five or even
three years ago. " The system of keep
ing books ha3 been almost completely
revolutionized by big firms, and with
this revolution has come a narrowing
or the lines along which the bookkeejyer
works:. -;,.The "present methods lighten*
his duties materially, but at the saote
time they -limit his opport unities Tor
knowing much about the details oZ the
business outside of the incidents of his
own department or the alphabetical
limits of one ledger. '
Under the present system loose-leaf
ledgers are used. They are arranged
alphabetically. One bookkeeper may
have his accounts ranging from A to
AR. Hi3 entries are set down for hini
by a force of young women, who re
cord accounts with a specially buolt
typewriter. These accounts- are Item
ized, and when filed comprise what
was formerly known as the Journal.
The only thing that concerns the book
keeper are the totals. These he re-,
cords in his ledger. Thl3 constitutes
his work. He knows nothicsr of what

Politics engaged Moffltt's attention
early In life, and in this field of activ
ity be developed an ability that placed
him for years In the forefront of Demo
cratic party councils. His initiation
was in 1884 as a candidate for the Ab
rembly, when he defeated R. M. Apgar
in a heavily Republican district. Mof
fitt served through the session of 18S5,
and in 1S87. after defeating H. A.
Powell for the Senate, served a term as
State Senator. In that capacity Moffitt
became one of the leading men of tbe
State Legislature. In the contest for
the election of a United States Senator
Su 1&S7 the Democrats had control of the
legislature. George Hearst was a can
didate and his fight was bandied by
Senator Moffltt. Hearst was elected.
After completing a' term in the Sen-
Ate Moffitt retired and wa? auwiintfd
Frank J. Moffltt was born in Oakland
In 1K9. His father was James Moffitt.
one of the pioneers and a famous fire
chief of tbe early days. Young Moffltt
was educated in the public schools of
Oakland. Journalism was his bent, and
while yet in young manhood he was at
tracted to the newspaper field. His first
attempt in serious effort was to estab
lleh the Enterprise at Newark, where
it had been expected a large city would
gTow as a center of the old South Pa
cific Coast Railroad. James G. Fair,
the principal owner of that system, had
planned to make Newark a large com
munity. But after Fair failed in his
fight to run the road through Tele
graph avenue In Oakland he abandoned
development schemes and subsequently
sold out the Bouth Pacific Coast line
to the Southern Pacific Company.
Moffltt conducted the Newark Enter
prise for some time, and after the boom
burst returned to Oakland, where he
engaged in newspaper work, sometimes
as correspondent for San Francisco
dailies and later as proprietor and ed
itor of the Oakland 'Weekly Independ
ent. This paper was the beginning of
tbe Oakland Enquirer, for the Inde
pendent was purchased by Frank A.
Leach and turned Into the . Enquirer.
Later Moffitt secured the â¢Â¦ Oakland
Horning Times, which he ran for some
years and which also fell into the
hands of Frank A- Leach.
OAKLAND, Nov. 24. â Just as
Thanksgiving- morning dawned Frank
J. MoCtt gave up tbe fight that
he had been waging against death for
three wt^ks and quietly passed away.
His death occurred at 6:25 o'clock.
There had been a slight rally yester
day, but the h^art, which hart been
weak and uncertain, finally gave out
this rooming and there pcrsed away
one of the b*Â£t known men. not alone
cf Oakland, but of California-
Mr. Moffitt'a illness had extended
over several years, but it was not until
Â¦within the last few weeks that any
thing serious was expected. He had
been suffering from both kidney and
liver troubles and was compelled to be
very careful with his diet. A few
ueekn ago he dined with a friend and
a slight indiscretion In eating intensi
fied his troubles. He took to his bed,
hi* heart began to fail and he was
never able to rally.
For some time Mr. Moffitt had been
convinced that his end was approach
ing and he met death quietly. He sent
for many of his old friends and bade
them all good-by. His family wu at
bis bedside when death came. The
funeral will take place on Saturday
from the late home at . the . corner of
Filbert and Eighteenth streets and
service* will be held later at the
Church of St. Francis de Sales. Inter
ment will be in the Moffitt family plat
in fit- Mary's Cemetery.
Just before his death Mr. Moffitt ar
ranged all of his business affairs. He
had accumulated a considerable for
tune In the last fifteen years, which Is
variously estimated at from $250,000
to J 500,000. Most of this money was
Invested in stocks and bonds, he be
ing a heavy holder of Contra Costa
Water Company's securities.
Senator Moffitt lavished money upon
his home, a fine residence at the
southwest corner of Filbert and Eight
eenth streets. He bought many beauti
ful works of art and adorned the house
with much elegance. His surviving fam
ily consists of a widow and a son. Jef
ferson Grant Moffitt, who is 18 years of
age. Besides these there are three
brothers and four sisters, who are
George W., Joseph, Harry, Mary, Mar
garet, Emma and Nellie Moffltt.
Only a short time ago Senator Moffitt
bought an elegant home in East Oak
land for his sisters. He was generous
toward his family and his relatives.
His brother Harry is well known as one
of the members of the United States
secret service department at San Fran
cisco. George has been connected with
the Oakland Fire Department for many
years. Joseph is a passenger conductor
in the Southern Pacific Company's em
ploy.
During the last years of his life Mof
fltt was very fortunate In his business
affairs and amassed a fortune of sev
eral hundred thousand dollars. He had
large interests In the Contra Costa
Water Company, was a heavy stock
holder in the Central Bank and owned
a block of stock and bonds of the Cali
fornia Portland Cement Company at
Napa Junction. All of his Investments
have been very profitable. j
Senator Moffitt returned to newspaper
work after he retired from tbe Legisla
ture and edited the Oakland Times un
til It was sold Eome years ago. From
newspaper work and political activities
Moffitt became associated with William
J. Dingee in the development of the
Oakland Water Company. It waV Mof
! fitt who, in large measure, carried
through the consolidation of the Oak
land Water Company and the Contra
Costa Water Company, the merged cor
porations retaining the name of the last
named, which was the older company.
After the consolidation Senator Moffitt
j was active In the management of the
company.
a member of the State Forestry Eoard.
He was instrumental in developing
many projects for the preservation of
the forests of California. He early
recognized the importance of their con
servation, a work which has become
one of the great studies of the National
Government.

Protestant Denominations of Berke
ley Hold Services.
BERKELEY, Nov. 24. â For the first
time in the history of the churches in
Berkeley union Thanksgiving services
were held to-day in an Episcopal
church. The so-called "Huntlngton
amendment" at the last meeting of the
governing body of the Episcopal
church provided for such manifesta
tions of denominational unity as was
exhibited in Berkeley to-day. The Kip
Memorial Church was the scene of the
gathering and there the ministers and
attendants of â¢ all the Protestant
churches in Berkeley met to. render
thanks and worship in unison.
Many of the worshipers looked for
the first time upon the vestments of
rector and choir and took part In the
ritualistic service of the Episcopal
church. Presbyterian and Methodist
clergymen sat side by side with Epis
copal ministers, the latter garbed In
the customary attire of those who
serve at Episcopal church altars.
Rev. Edward Lambe Parsons, rector
of St. Marks, delivered the sermon.
He referred to the spirit of the day
and the times which have developed
an era of general thanksgiving. The
presence of worshipers of so many de
nominations was declared by the
speaker to be an Indication that the
world is growing broader and better.
The barriers of creed are not so In
surmountable, he said, that all might
not worship together the common
Savior and Lord.
The following ministers assisted in
the service: Rev. C. K. Jenness of
Trinity Church; Rev. E. W. Darst of
the First Christian; Rev. A. S. Coate3.
Evangel Baptist; Rev. W. H. Hopkins.
First Congregational Church.
The following programme of music
was rendered:
St. John's Church was organized by
the Rev. Father Akeriy, who came to
California on his way to a foreign mis
sionary field, but seeing the need of a
church in this city, gave up his life to
work in Oakland. He remained as
rector of the church nearly forty years.
Father King, who, for more than fifty
years has been pastor of the church of
the Immaculate Conception.was a warm
personal friend of Father Akeriy, and
although differing In religious belief,
the two pioneer clergymen worked to
gether for the spiritual betterment of
the people of this city. !
' St. John's Episcopal Church, of which
the Rev. Edgar F. Gee Is rector, will
celebrate Its fiftieth anniversary on
December 18. The celebration will take
the form of a union service of all the
Episcopal churches in the city. The
programme ha.=i not yet been fully ar
ranged, but it is expected that Bishop
William Ford Nichols will preach the
jubilee sermon. Dean A. L* G. True,
formerly rector of St. John's, who is
now located at Pasadena, has also be*n
invited to attend the celebration.
Two of Oakland's pioneer churches
will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary
of their organization during the coming
month, and the members of these
churches are making preparations for
jubilee services in commemoration of
the event. The first of these celebra
tions will be that of the First Bapt/st
Church, which was organized Decem
ber 7, 1S^4. It is now the largest church
of its denomination in Alameda County,
and the present pastor, the Rev. H. J.
Vosburgh, has arranged for a series of
jubilee services which will extend over
an entire week, beginning December 4,
and ending December II. Meetings will
be h*ld every evening during the week
at the beautiful new church on Tele
graph avenue.

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 24. â It is
understood that Anthony J. Drexel Is
trying to sell his steam yacht Mar
gherita of the New York Yacht Club
to Russia.
Would Sell His Yacht to Russia.
It Is doubtful, the correspondent
says, whether even Great Britain holds
a higher place In Japan's esteem, and
affection than America. The writer
says this sentiment Is of long and un
checked growth. Jt began under the
diplomatic regime of Townsend Har
ris and the numerous instances of
America's friendship since that time
have so resulted that no Western na
tion !b more cherished by Japan than
America.
These considerations should suffice
to show how extravagant is the sug
gestion that Japan would ever resent
the floating of the Stars and Stripes
over the Philippines. On the contrary t
America's withdrawal from the Philip
pines would be regarded by the Jap
anese as little short of a calamity, since
her presence constitutes a guarantee
for the continuance of her wholesome
interest in Far Eastern affairs.
LONDON, Nov. 25. â Writing from
Tokio on the subject of alleged
intrigue of Russian agents to sow dis
cord between Japan and America and
to create the feeling in America that
Japan's success in the present war
would jeopardize America's 'position In
the Philippines, a correspondent of the
Times declares that nothing could be
more chimerical.
Her British AHyv
Sentiment Is Deeper Than That for
JAPAN'S LOVE FOR AMERICA.
BERLIN, Nov. 24. â The German
Red Cross Society has prepared an
other sanitary train for nursing the
Russian sick and wounded, The train
will proceed to the frontier in a few
days, where It will be turned over to
the Russian ofScials.
German Aid for the Wounded.
"At dawn of November 23 the ene
my made several surprise attacks near
the Shakhe Railway bridge and at
Paotzuyen, but the attacks were en
tirely repulsed."
"At midnight of November 22 600
of the enemy's infantry attacked Sing
luntun. Our advanced picket, after
resisting the attack for several hours,
safely retired to the main body. The
village was entirely burned by the
enemy.
TOKIO, Nov. 24. â Manchurian head
quarters, In a telegram dated Novem
ber 23, reports:
Apply the Torch to Singluntun After
Its Capture.
RUSSIANS BURN A TOWN.
For the rest the .Government could
only assure those concerned that it
contemplated the sacrifice of no Ger
man interests. In conclusion the Pre
mier strongly exhorted the members
that energetic work for the pressing
needs of the empire was the best
means to heal party differences.
Earlier in the sitting Premier von
Koeber. defending his policy, dealt
with the difficulty of reconciling the
conflicting aspirations of the various
parties. With reference to Innsbruck
he said that practically the Italian
faculty there was no longer In exis
tence and that neither international
nor other weighty consideration stood
in the way of its formal suppression.
He hoped the Czech representatives
would abandon obstruction and for
that reason he had advised the Em
peror to appoint a Bohemian national
Minister- M
VIENNA, Nov. 24. â Disturbances
marked the session of the lower house
of the Reichsrath to-day and this
evening the President abruptly closed
the sitting amid great excitement. The
uproar commenced when a Socialistic
member, replying to the President's
stricture on "the language used In the
last few^days, said the Social Demo
crats have never attacked the wearer
of the crown, but would not be pre
vented from telling the truth about
the "Camarilla which ruled Austria."
During the consequent^Qiscussion the
President declared the session closed.
The galleries created tremendous con
fusion by shouting and showering the
house with slips of paper inscribed.
"Down with the Clerical spoilers of
the schools." *

no conveniences now costs $2 a day,
whereas before the war a half-dozen
small houses in the corral were rented
for 550 a year.
The question of heating is even more
serious. Wood is worth a cent a pound.
The commissariat is struggling to make
ample provision, still there is bound to
be much suffering, especially at the
front. Fortunately, warm clothing for
the soldiers has arrived.
LONDON, Nov. 24. â The corre

PARIS. Nov. 24. â The arsenal
hands at Brest, Cherbourg and
L'Orient have decided to resume worlc
to-morrow, but a fresh strike in the
near future Is probable.
The general question of housing the
people of Mukden is serious. Chinese
from all the surrounding country are
flocking In for the winter, and besides
the military quarters must be found for
The artillery has been silent for two
days. The opinion now prevails that if
the Japanese do not begin a general
attack General Kuropatkin will again
take the offensive.
Much difficulty is being experienced
with camp followers, mostly Circas
sians, Tartars and other tribesmen of
the Caucasus. They swagger around in
cloaks and fur hats, with daggers at
their belts, and .have committed so
many depredations that severe meas
ures have been adopted to get rid of
them.
MUKDEN. Nov., 24.â The Japanese
made a fresh attack on Poutiloff Hill
the night of November 22. The ad
vancing ranks were decimated by. the
Russian shell fire. Some of the Japa
nese secured lodgment on the elopes of
the hill, but were driven out at the
point of the bayonet, and the whole
Japanese contingent fled.
A similar attempt was made the same
night south of Erdagzou, which also
was repulsed with a bayonet charge.
The Japanese lost heavily, while the
Russian loss was thirty killed.
A band of 1500 Chinese bandits, with
six gens, under Japanese officers, com
ing from the direction of the Llao River
was in conflict with three sotnias of
border scouts near Kaiuan early on the
morning of November 23. The scouts
charged without giving the bandits'
battery time to come Into action. The
bandits made feeble resistance and fled
in all directions, leaving 200 of their
dead. The Russian loss was trifling.
A Japanese column of two companies
attempted to penetrate the Russian
east flank on November 23, but were
met by two separate divisions of Rus
sian cavalry and driven oft with severe
loss.
Unofficial advices only bring affairs at
the front up to November 23, and the ab
sence of official news of later date, either
from the Japanese or from the Russian
side, causes the belief that more im
portant operations than heretofore may
be progressing. Reports from the cor
respondents at the front indicate re
newed skirmishing, culminating on the
night of November 22 in a fierce attack
on Poutiloff (Lone Tree Hill), In which
the Japanese were repulsed with heavy
loss and also a severe fight with Chi
nese bandits near Kaiuan, in which 200
Chinese were killed.
ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 24.âGen
eral Kuropatkln's tardily published offi
cial announcement of the losses for the
period of twelve days prior to October
2L amounting in sick and wounded to
943 officers and 31,211 men, startles the
public. No mention is made of the
dead, although S000 are reported by cor
respondents to have fallen in the right
wing alone in the series of charges un
successfully made to capture General
Oku's position.
According to a special dispatch from
the front. General Kuropatkin's desire
to remain quiescent is not likely to be
respected by Marshal Oyama. The Rus
sian Alert correspondent telegraphs:
"Tb*re are evidences that the Japan
ese are not going to leave us alone,
but are going to make a determined ef
fort to double in our left flank."

The only permanent forts in the pos
session of the Japanese are the two
Panlung forts, captured In August. The
Japanese hold the advance works of the
Rihlung redoubt, called Fort Kuropat
kln, an entrenched hill miscalled "P"
fort, Kobu Hill. Sachltakiyama and
174-meter hill. They also occupy the
caponlere, galleries and moats of the
two Rihlung forts and North Keekwan
fort.
CHEFTJ, Nov. 24.â A huge pile of coal
near the railway station at Port Ar
thur was Ignited by Japanese shells on
November 20, and according to Chinese
arriving here by junk to-day it was
still burning when they left the be
sieged town on November 22. A Japa
nese torpedo-boat destroyer overhauled
this junk, but allowed it to proceed.
Another junk with six Hindoos on
board was taken ashore, where the
junk was burned. The passengers were
sent to Dalny.
The report that the steamship Tung
chow, laden with 30.000 tins of meat,
was captured by the Japanese yesterday
while trying to enter Port Arthur ap
pears to have been correct. The Tung
chow was a British vessel and belonged
to Butterfleld & Swire of Shanghai.
Last Monday when leaving Shanghai
she was transferred at the las,t mo
ment to a man believed to be acting for
the Russian Government.
TOKIO, Nov. 2*4.â Telegraphing to
day, the headquarters of the army be
fore Port Arthur reports:
"The conflagration in the buildings
near the arsenal caused by our naval
guns, which, as reported yesterday, be
gan about noon on November 22, con
tinued until 2 o'clock on the morning of
November 23. It is Drobable that the
coal stores have been burned."
LONDON, Nov. 25. â The correspond
ent at Moscow of the Dally Telegraph
claims authority for the statement that
General Stoessel's dispatch sent by the
torpedo-boat Rastoropny Informed Em
peror Nicholas that the Port Arthur
garrison was being starved out, with
other frank details of Its actual condi
tion, showing that the fall of the fort
ress is inevitable.

Home Cures for Drunk*
enness Do Not Cure.
Every day I am in receipt of dozens
| of letters from people from out of
j town who have heard of my famous
j cure for the drink habit and who
write to know if I cannot send it by
mail â if they cannot be cured at home.
I answer No.
The reason is simple. Excessive
drinking affects no two men alike;
neither are two men ever in exactly
the same physical condition. Then,
again, complications arise from drink-
ing. Every case needs and must have
individual treatmentâ no two cases
are alike.
Every man who comes to any of my
offices receives the personal attention
of the highest skilled physician and
my cure is administered to suit such
case after thorough examination.
If you really want a cure that cures
come to me. I can't send my cure.
Call or write.

WÂ« wish to impress ur>on our friends
and prospective patrons once more and |
with emphasis, the importance of the !
honest effort we are making In this :
"speciai sale" of the great Weber piano. |
to not only accompISsh our object to :
raise a certain amount of money within j
a given time, for an honest business !
purpose, by sacrificing the finest stock
Of the highest-grade piano ever placed |
before the public In a special sale â the
Weberâ but the factâ and it is a factâ,
that we. and I believe no one else has ;
ever offered to do so much for so little j
in our line of business, no matter what ;
the requirements, as we are doing for
our friends in this Weber piano sale; j
and while it is not wholly through phil- '.
anthropy that tre do this, our motive j
being more or less a selfish one â (we j
have an object to gain) â nevertheless '
the fact remains, that the necessity of j
the occasion requires us to do some- j
thing for nothing in this sale, so far as j
profits are concerned.
For it Is a fact that, notwithstanding j
Â«Â« have raised over J1S.000 cash during
the sale, and sold more than half the '
Weber line of pianos on hand in nine
days, we are loser* on the deal, but ;
when we have completed the sale, and
pot in bank the $30,000 cash required to .
close our option on the new deal, where- j
by we control the Coast on a certain;
line of pianos, then we shall feel light- '
hearted, breathe easy, and be in a posi-
tion to make the gain we are not mak- ;
ing, while selling Â¦â¢Webers"â one of the
grandest pianos ever produced â at $160 j
tr> $275 less than their retail value, and^
that is Just what we are doing: selling"!
one style $160 and another $273 be- :
low their established retail prices every- '
where: and we are selling them too, ;
every hour: Weber. Wheelock and Stuy- \
vosa-t pianos â all built by the Weber ;
people â and the time is here and now.
tot our friends who have the means and
who ever hope to own a piano so fine :
as the Weber, to step up and give us an
opportunity to show our good faith in ;
the matter.
While our statements are frank and :
â¢--rrrhatic, thev shall be found true and ',
reliable.
To the best of our knowledge and !
ability, no patron of ours shall ever be '
misled by the word or pen of

power. i *
The idea of the sanctity of the mar
ried relation has come to be held so
lightly both here and abroad that peo
ple in general are amused instead of
shocked by a suggestion like that satir
ical one of Meredith's, that marriage be
limited to a definite term. A distin
guished cartoonist of our city put the
real situation in a nutshell by pointing
the questions: To whom under such a
regime would belong the responsibility
of the children â and what would be
come ultimately of discarded wives
who were unable to make new marital
contracts because youth and beauty
had faded? It is to the .interest of
women and children that marriage be
upheld as a sacred Institution, not to
be profaned or violated.
Love is the only key to this great
matrimonial puzzle of our own and
preceding centuries. By love I do not
mean that blatant folly which leads a
man to proclaim loudly that he is ready
to die for the object of his passion or
that weakness of head and heart which
permits woman to hold . her honor
cheap.
. I mean the steadfast affection which
makes a man or a .woman willing to
love and love, to do the right thing and
to suffer, if need be â the kind of love to
which George Eliot referred when she
said: "It is not true that love makes
all things easyâ It makes us choose
what is difficult"
People should not expect the Impos
sible of marriage. A marriage license
Is not a magic talisman. A clerical
benediction is not the "presto change!"
of a magician. Neither has power to
work a miracle. Nor can both together
by a single stroke weld into one human
instrument two natures absolutely dif
ferent In kind. Only a real and endur
ing love can work the charm.
THE crusade against divorce which
the Methodist and' Episcopal
clergy have proposed is not a
movement peculiar to our times. As
long ago as the reign of Edward VI
the English churchmen were similarly
roused to holy zeal in wedlock'B cause.
The problem existed long before that
day. It is probably as old as marriage
laws.
"Marriage is never an answer; it is
always a question," observes Fantana
lightly In the musical, comedy of the
same name which is now regaling the
Chicago public. In real life it Is what
Asmes Reppelier defined it In an essay
recently published, a problem which
presents the "contrast of manhood and
womanhood, of human creatures whose
hearts and tastes and instincts are rad
ically unlike, who differ in all essen
tials from the foundations of their be
ing."
Divorce is an answer to the mat
rimonial question which appears, from
statistics and the daily press, to be
gaining in popularity. I believe with
all my heart that sometimes it is a
good answer, the only answer. When
ever, from the conditions of the family
life, the welfare of the coming genera
tion is jeopardized, divorce is ethical;
unfortunate it still is, but It Is a neces
sary eviL No woman, for example,- has
a right to give to children an Inheri
tance of drunkenness, disease or Imbe
cility.
Divorce Bought for, purely selfish mo
tives, however, cannot be anything
but a degradation to the Individual
who seeks it, and to the society which
lends it countenance. The trouble Is
not so much with the divorce laws; any
law which protects the weak, the help
less, and the dependent members of a
community is a good law. It is the ap
plication of the laws which, is at fault.

women will take vigorous action when
they find that men will not surrender
their seats to them.

When it is remembered that 75 per cent of all the local tonnage
carried in California is affected by water competition, the economic
importance of our rivers and harbors is made plain. Because our
river navigation as seen on the map is only a few hundred miles it
appears of but little importance. The Eastern river lines, thousands
of miles long, seem to eclipse it But it is of vast importance to
California. Nowhere else in the United States are there rivers open
for navigation every day in the year, flowing between banks that
have a daily production of something that profitably uses water
transportation.
Our rivers flow through a country that produces all kinds of
grain, all kinds of deciduous fruit, all kinds of citrus fruit Their
tributary country furnishes canned and dried fruits and vegetables
upon which the world has come to depend for its supply. There is
scarcely anything produced by the soil as a luxury or a necessary
of life that is not brought to the river banks of California for trans
portation. It is for this reason that the people of our wide river
region were inspired by great hope when The Call was able to
announce that our members of Congress intend to make the rectifica
tion and navigability of the rivers one 'of their first duties, to be
persisted in until all available plans are supported by the necessary
appropriations. The sympathy of the Secretary of War with their
purpose is appreciated by our people and"will not be forgotten.
MR. TAFT, Secretary of War, in his current report, has not
overlooked the needs of the Sacramento River, and his posi
tion gives some strong assurance that the plans of our mem
bers of Congress for a comprehensive and conclusive river policy in
California will have his sympathy and support. The Secretary says
that now the river is in a deplorable condition, injurious to naviga
tion, and 'needful of immediate attention. > Even the removal of
snags that obstruct boats is neglected. The report says that at
the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1903, there was not money
enough left in the river appropriation to make the necessary repairs
to the snag boat.
THE SACRAMENTO.
"But the relation of a Representative to these appointments
rests not upon law, but upon custom. Some one must be consulted,
and. as a rule, the Congressman is the man whose advice is the
most apt to be that which can be followed with advantage to the
community and therefore to the party. But this is a mere custom,
and I have never hesitated a moment to deviate from it, whenever
circumstances arose that satisfied me it was wise and proper to do
so. In scores of cases I have been obliged to disregard the recom
mendations of Congressmen for all kinds of reasons, usually because
1 have believed the^man recommended to me was unfit. Occa
sionally I have disregarded them because I felt that the man who
was in office was so conspicuously fit that he ought to be retained.
"I wish also to point out to you that it is also proper to pay
heed not only to the wishes of Cabinet officers, but even of Senators
of the opposite party, in the case of nominations to office in their
own towns. In such cases I have sometimes appointed the man
recommended by a Democratic Senator, and even when I have not
done this I have consulted him about the man I did appoint. That
I should consult a member of my own Cabinet in reference to the
postmaster in his own city goes without saying."
It is not necessary to add that Mr. Pinkham was reappointed
to the Haverhill postoffice. The President's letter reads like a
declaration of independence, in view of what has been done under
some administrations. He proposes to seek all means by which the
fitness of an applicant for office may be known. This is notice to
the unfit to give up hope, even when backed by Senators and Rep
resentatives. It also opens direct approach to the President with all
matters that touch the propriety of any appointment, or any re
moval from office. In other words, the President proposes to carry
into the selection 'of officers his ideas about a square deal, and the
people like it.
/-N NE of the most important letters written recently by President
( ) RoosL-wh has strangely escaped general publication and at-
tentioii. Mr. Moody, Attorney General in the^ President's
Cabinet, was formerly a member of Congress from Massachusetts,
living at Haverhill. He resigned his seat in" the House to become
Secretary of the Navy. When Mr. Knox retired from the Depart
ment of" Justice tp be Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Moody was
transferred to the office of Attorney General and Mr. Morton took
his place in the Xavy Department.
While Mr. Moody was a member of the House he requested
the appointment of Mr. Pinkham as postmaster in his home town
of Haverhiil, and President McKinley made the appointment. Mr.
Moody was succeeded in Congress by Mr. Gardner. When Mr.
Hnkham's term in the Haverhill postoffice approached its end Mr.
Gardner, who lives at Hamilton, requested that he be not reap
pointed and named another man for the place. To this Mr. Moody
objected, as Mr. Pinkham had made an exceptionally good post
master. Whereupon Mr. Gardner protested against interference by
a Cabinet officer in the appointment of postmasters in their home
towns. His protest was in the form of a letter to the President, in
which he said : "It is not a parallel case in Massachusetts to those
States in which Senators select postmasters. In Massachusetts it
has been understood that a Congressman shall select postmasters
in the towns and cities in his district."
This was the statement of the case from the standpoint of a
"practical politician," and no doubt Mr. Gardner conceived that he
had an airtight case. But the President differed, and took occasion
to state his position in a letter that may fairly be taken as a declara
tion of his policy during the term to which he was elected imme
diately after it was published. In this letter the President says :
"To clear up any possible misapprehension I would like at the
outset to say that Senators do not 'select' postmasters in any
State while lam President. I consult them always and in the vast
majority of cases act on the recommendation they make, but the
selection is mine, not theirs, and time and again during the three
years I have been President I have positively refused to select in
dividuals suggested to me for nomination as postmasters by various
Senator?. If I am not satisfied with the character and standing of the
man whose name is suggested to me, I never nominate him. I un
derstand perfectly that the Senators are part of the appointing
power, and that they have the same right to reject that I have to
nominate, and therefore the appointment must represent an agree
ment between them and me, and as the acquaintance of the Senator
with his State is much greater than that of the President can pos
sibly be it is the normal and natural thing that I should listen to
their advice as to these appointments, and I generally do so. But
I stop listening to it as soon as I find that a Senator is advising me
wrongly. So much for my relations with my. constitutional ad
visers.
The dark mass In the opposite chair
seemed to be considering the question.
There was a movement, and the point
of light that marked his cigar shifted.
. "She has," he said with calm convic
tion, "only one expects her to have too
much taste to exercise the right." There
was a pause, and then he elaborated:
"Being a woman, you see, dear girl, is
just a trifle like being caught in a net.
It is by no means the same thing as be
ing a man, and all the emancipation in
the world can't really free her. She is
an entirely different being, and I'm
rather glad she Is."
The girl was holding her. breath, she
scarcely knew why. Sprites, hand In
hand, seemed to be dancing along her
nerves and singing in tiny, threadlike
voices, that only she could hear, "And
I'm glad, too; and Fm glad, too!" It
took her several moments to study the
sudden joy. Then she pursued the ar
gument calmly.
"But no â surely you're not In earnest
â surely you're not of the antiquated
school that believes, for Instance, that
a woman's brain is of a different â and,
of course, inferior â caliber to man's?"
There was a fine disdain In her tone,
notwithstanding the fact that her heart
was beating Impatiently.
The man chuckled softly, for truth to
tell he was that very sort of a creature.
Never had he been able to take the or
gan under discussion seriously. He ad
mitted it now without reserve, with a
fine, large, indulgent masculine assur
ance.
"It's a wonderful little contrivance,
the feminine brain," he concluded, "but
certainly it is different."
Again in the darkness the mouselike
smile flashed out and back again, ac
companied this time by an audible
sound that started as a snicker, but
was deftly turned Into a sniff' of scorn.
It was the latter that the man recog
nized and greeted with an amused
laugh.
"Ever hear about the little butercup
that pined to be a daisyâ or the rose
that swore it was a potato, and if it
wasn't it would be â there now?" In
quired the man with bland curiosity.
Again the point of light shifted. He had
replaced the cigar in his mouth and
settled a little more luxuriously in his
chair, as if In mere sybaritic enjoyment
of his extraordinary luck In having
been born as he was.
"Your Illustrations are beside the
facts," she retorted at last, with dig
nity. "I was not asserting that girls
wish to be men!"
"Well, then" â bis tone implied an
amiable desire to please â "ever hear of
the little buttercup that insisted that
it was a daisy, in spite of appearances
and the testimony of Its yellow petals?
Well, that's like the foolish little girls
who want to â¢ be judged by man's
standard."
Two slender hands were clapped noise
lessly, but their owner enunciated with
some heat: "How would you like to be
a woman yourself and be put upon,
and â and snubbed and forever taunted
with the fact of your Inferiority? Oh,
not. In so many words," she went on
hurriedly, lest he should interrupt her
speech. "Not that, of course; but by be
ing told that you couldn't understand,
being patronized, having allowances
made â 'Oh, well, she's only a woman!'
Just tell me, honor bright, how would
you like itr
The man chuckled. The vision of him
self in the predicament suggested was
not without its humorous side. The fig
ure of speech he had used a few min
utes earlier came back to him with a
new force. It was like being caught
under a net, though the meshes were
silken. ;
"Well?" she demanded, with a ring of
triumph In her voice.
"I don't suppose I should like it,"- he
admitted between puffs. "But that
doesn't " prove anything, you know," he
went on hastily. "That's because I'm a
man." Then, as an afterthought, "When
you're once used to being a woman-^r
â I should think you might get. used to
it â grow to like it. Man's good angel,
you know, and all that!" ;
"But what lf one wearies of the role
of good angelâ what If one longs to be
Just one's self? For my part I -don't
see why man shouldn't be woman's
good angel for a while â he's so strong
and brave and, above all, superior!"-
Her voice was " deceptively mocking.
Being only a man, and, a man.' in the
dark at that, he had no way of know
ing that her eyes were ?'; dancing mis
chievously, and she was , wondering ; if
he were horribly shocked." What he did
know, however, was that the" .voice,
with its youthful; almost boyish;, treble,
.was the sweetest in . the -world to himâ
that he would rather bejmocked and
flounted ' by , those lips â¢ than , flattered ; by
any; others. >.. Still,^ he \ had >a> point Ho
prove, and heUossed.the dwindled 'cigar
Â«ff "; Into the buehea < that \ flanked the.
Li A s lf marriage were the only
A end and aim of a girl's life!"
/""V she threw off ecornfully. Her
companion smoked lmper
turbably .into the night for several
seconds before replying. Always he
had the air of one loth to break a
silence, one who had a constitutional
aversion to the futilities of speech. But
she was accustomed to that, even
whimsically attached to his deliberate
ways. At last he spoke. In the dark
ness she could see his face only as a
pale blur, but there was a suspicious
sweetness in his tone.
"All the little rippling, purling
brooks," he said slowly, "and ail the
ordinary rivers, even the great majestic
streams, 'wind somewhere to the sea."
And I'm sure it isn't my fault," he
added, in an injured voice.
"Some rivers plunge underground
and lose themselves," she argued stub
bornly.
"I said 'ordinary rivers.' " This with
laconic patience from the gloom.
A quick, flashing smile touched her
lips and vanished, as if frightened to
find itself in the dark. She wonderedâ
well, a number of things; as, for in
stance, what he was thinking of at that
very instant, whether he had ever been
really in love, and if so what she was
likeâ how deeply love would stir him,
whetherâ
She made a little impatient movement
to brush away the thoughts which
buzzed through her mind like gnats,
but still they hovered about, scattered
but not dispersed. He was one of the
men a woman simply had to think
aboutâ broad of shoulder and exasper
atlngly masculine â a sort of unex
plored country of mannishness that
forever challenged. She drew a sharp,
piqued sigh. However much the femi
nine mind paid tribute, he apparently
preserved a Jove-like calm. Ruthlessly
she prodded him again. ;
"But why hasn't a girl just as good
a right to contemplate the joys of bach
elorhood as a man?" she demanded. "A
man marries if he wants to, when he
wants and, above all, because he wants
to; while a girlâ well, she gets the Idea
that matrimony is a refuge from the
wrath to come. If she doesn't marryg
she knows that her best friends will re
fer to her behind her vback as an 'old
maid,' and think of her as one of life's
failures. It isn't fair! Why hasn't she
just as much of a right to her single
ness as a man?"
porch, squared his shoulders aggres
sively and demanded:
"Would you propose to a man if â erâ
you loved him?"
His listener gasped: This was carry
ing the war into the enemy's country
with a vengeance. Propose to a man
she loved! Not for rubles and dia
mondsânot for principalities and pow
ers! One might propose to a man one
didn't love, but to the manâ never!
"No," came the answer, In a voice
grown suddenly small and meek.
"And she talks about wanting a man's
rights," he groaned to some invisible
person. "And she hasn't the nerve to do
a little thing like that. My, oh. my!"

There was a pause, in which he wait

the gloom she could see the shining of
his eyes. He, too, must have seen some
secret thing in her face, for with a

Rev. Mr. Harrison had attempted to
construct a new church for his parish
when Archbishop Ireland announced
his cathedral project. This contem
plated the erection of a $3,000,000 ca
thedral parish house, which would nec
essitate the abandonment of Father
Harrison's building plans. His oppo
sition to the proposal of the Archbish
op led to his transfer to the Minneapo
lis parish and his suspension on refu
sal to obey the order.
Rev. Mr. Harrison's appeal to Rome
grew out of an order from Archbishop
Ireland on June 16, 1904, suspending
him from the priesthood because of
disobedience in refusing to resign the
pastorate of St. Joseph's parish, Mich
igan.

Wallace is charged with stealing stock
certificates to the value of {30,000 from
James Breltung, a banker of Mar
<ruette, Mich., by whom Wallace was
employed as confidential secretary. The
prisoner had a letter of credit for $22,
000 on Coutts' Bank, London, j It is
alleged that he had already drawn
{5000 from a Liverpool bank.
BOSTON, 1 Nov. 24.â The Boston po
lice were notified about ten days ago
that James Wallace of , Marquette,
Mich., was missing from that place,
and that there was reason for suppos
ing he had come to this city. It de
veloped that Wallace had been here a
day or two and then had sailed for
England. Wallace called on Lee, Hlg
ginson & Co., bankers, and obtained
a. letter of credit on Coutts* Bank,
London, for {22,000.
Yesterday Edward Breltung brought
a bill in equity in the Superior Court
here against the Boston bankers, seek
ing to have them enjoined from pay-
Ing any part of this sum to Wallace,
as announced in dispatches last night.
Wallace left Marquette on October
20, leaving word with his employer
that he was going to an institution for
the cure of inebriety in Illinois. When
he did not return Breitung began an
investigation with the result that 850
shares of Michigan copper mining
stock and 200 shares of United States
Steel preferred stock were found to
be missing. He at once reported the
case to the American Bankers' Asso
ciation, with the result that. a search
was begun for Wallace.
It was found that he took passage
from Boston on the Cunard liner Sax
onia for Liverpool on November 12,
with a woman said to be his wife, un
der the name of Mr. and Mrs. James
Wilson. It was subsequently learned
that Wallace had obtained a letter of
credit in Boston for Â£4400. Wheq the
steamer reached England a detective
was at the pier and the man and wo
man who had gone over under the
name of Wilson were followed until
the man was positively Identified as
Wallace. Wallace was then taken Into
custody. The letter of ' credit for
Â£4400 and the money which Wallace
had in his possession were recovered.

Felton is said to have come from
Chicago several years ago. Roche is 35
years old. In 1895 he was convicted of
killing "Sheeny George" Levl and was
sent to Sing Sing to serve nine years,
but was pardoned after serving four
years. At the hospital again to-night
he refused to say who had shot him.
By this time the crowd had grown
to such proportions that reserves had
to be called before Felton could be
taken to the police station. There two
witnesses said they saw Felton fire
two shots the Instant before Roche
fell-
"Leave It to me; if I die, all right; if
I live, I will make good," waa all Roche
would eay.
Roche was hurried to a hospital,
where it was said his condition is crit
ical.

and declared that if he lived he would
settle his account himself.

crowd, followed by hundreds of men
and women who shouted for the police.

Two tournaments and an exhibition
doubles match yesterday kept both
tennis players and spectators busily
occupied. On the California Club
courts a handicap singles tournament
for men was commenced. A handicap
mixed doubles tourney was finished
down to the semi-finals at the park. A
special doubles match between the
Hardy brothers and Drummond Mac-
Gavin and Percy Murdock was also
played.
Of the thirty-six players entered in
the California Club tournament but
nine were left in the competition when
darkness put a stop to play. The suc
cessful players, with their handicaps,
were Al Kenyon (15>,^W. G. Knowlton
(15 3-6), M. Little (30 3-6), Harry Rolfe
(owe 15), Sherwood Adams (owe 15),
M. Long (scratch), George Janes (owe

Collier (owe 15). .
The exhibition doubles match was the
drawing card at the park and the larg
est crowd of the season turned out to.
witness it. By beating the Jlardys
rather easily MacGavin and Murdock
showed they did not play up to form
at San Rafael in September. The
Hardys are probably the strongest
team on the coast. It is only fair to
them to state that they were not at
their best yesterday. On the other
hand, Murdock and MacGavin put up
a remarkably good game. They robbed
the contest of considerable interest by
winning the first two sets easily. The
third set was won by the Hardy broth
ers after fourteen games had been
played. The score in favor of Murdock
and MacGavin was 6-1, 6-3, 6-8.
In the mixed doubles tournament five
teams are left. Miss Vodden and
Charles Foley (owe 3-6). Miss Ethel
Ratcliffe and Charles Dunlap (owe

The flying gelding maintained his ad
vantage until well into the stretch,
where Davis overtook him with the fa
vorite, and Gateway, on the outside,
loomed up as a dangerous factor. Less
than a hundred yards from the wire.
Military Man, slightly in front, seemed
the winner. Then all. three horses
named flashed by the judges' -stand,
and H. L. Frank, which had undoubt
edly answered a last request from his
rider, was awarded the verdict. The
officials could have awarded it to any
one of the. trio and there would have
been no protest.
W. Davis landed the concluding num
ber, a Belling event over one and a six
teenth miles, with El Piloto. An 8 to 5
choice throughout the betting, the
brown gelding experienced no difficulty
in disposing of Mountebank and Meis
tereinger.
By far the most exciting finish of the
afternoon occurred at the conclusion of
the Futurity course sprint, when H. L.
Frank, Military Man and Gateway
crossed the line noses apart amid
frantic cheering from their different
supporters. Military Man from Garnet
Ferguson's stable had the call, as it
was reckoned that he had a slight edge,

Billy Cahill's Bab enjoyed a pleasant
outing in the mile aria* fifty yard sell

an odds-on favorite around post time
and was returned the easiest sort of a
winner. Davis . waited with her until
reaching the stretch, and then in turn
passing Tannhauser and J. V. Kirby,
passed the judges five lengths before
the last mentioned starter.
For a time it looked as if The Mist,
which defeated his field in the handi
cap at six furlongs for two-year-olds,
might be disqualified. The filly from
the Hammond stable carried 112 pounds,
and never better than 1 to 2 was obtain

she failed to show any dazzling amount
of speed, even though cutting out all
the pace. About opposite the trainers'

as he might have been, for Sherwood

Game little Fossil had a host of
friends and with "Big Bill" Knapp at
the tiller his chances looked bright.
Ananias, Bombardier and Barklyite
were also well supported. After the
usual parade there was only a minute
and a half delay at the post when
Dick Dwyer sprung the barrier.
Claude swerved at the start, Interfer
ing somewhat with Ananias, Bombar
dier and Arcade. The stay of Colonel
Anderson in front was not lengthy,
and then Reed, astride Ananias,
picked up the running, trailed by
Leila, Fossil and Gold Money. In this
order, ivith the rest well bunche^ be
hind them, the bend for home was
rounded. Dominick now made his
run with Claude and a furlong away
from the stand the Daly horse was
in front, with the others all driving.
Fossil alone was the dangerous one
and he could get but within a length
of th<? favorite, which won cleverly in
1:5394. A length behind Fossil, Gold
Money held Ananias safe for the small
eno> of the purse.
When Dominick, on the winner, re
turned to the winner's circle he re
ceived a perfect ovation. Fossil, too,
w-as not forgotten for his splendid
showing.
As it was reported in inner circles
that Sad Sam had only recently recov
ered from an attack of whooping cough
or some other Infantile ailment, the
books made a mark of the willowy half
breed. They made a target of him and
held Matt Hogan at such a short price
that the public vras forced to let the
latter alone.
â¢ SAD SAM IS BACKED.
FOSSIL HAS FRIENDS.
There was a surging, seething mass
of people in the ring, and in the scram
ble to get money in action etiquette was
tossed to the winds. Seventeen ordinary
and three field books were inadequate
to handle the coin. Although four fa
vorites came through, the major por
tion of the layers won.
The handicap was fourth on the pro
gramme, with nine acceptances. Know
ing the fondness of the public for the
Jennings colors. Gold Money, carrying
119, and Arcade, with 106 pounds up,
coupled, had first call in the opening
betting. Shouldering top weight after
the declination of Dainty to appear,
Claude attracted the most attention; in
fact, he was finally made the medium
of a plunge, closing favorite over the
Jennings pair.
The racing was superb. As a season
ing sauce for the plum pudding that
went with the turkey, the innumerable
Derby winner Claude, the favorite, cap
tured the rich Thanksgiving handicap,
at on? and an eighth miles, worth $2170
to the winner. He was faultlessly rid
den by Eddie Dominick, one of the most
popular boys that ever donned the silk
in this part of the world. Everybody
seemed happy over the victory of Mike
Daly's horse.
RACING IS SUPERB
But the vast concourse of holiday
pleasure seekers which kept the turn
stiles at Oakland track clicking yester
day like the monotonous buzzing of
the roulette wheels at Monte Carlo, sur
passed 8 11 previous gatherings of re
cpnt years, a conservative estimate
placing the number of persons present
at nearly 12,000. It was most assured
ly a tribute of confidence to the new
California Jockey Club for its efforts to
conduct the sport in an irreproachable
manner. The women were gowned ac
cording to fashion's latest edicts and
the men were well groomed and
dressed, resembling December fashion
plates. Even the cosy little clubhouse
was packed, its verandas being so
Jammed with society's elect that only
the old English brick chimney was
discernible from the paddock.
Unquestionably during: the gala times
of the old Ocean Side track when the
town was smaller and the pancake hat
and puffed hair were the correct thing,
some mighty big crowds found their
way to the old course. Then a single
four-mile race wm gTeeted with as
much acclaim by the simple argonauts
as iE a Thanksgiving day dinner with
a small bottle of the vintage on the
Fide, by a hungry tramp.

The result of a freak of a storm
recently is seen upon many of the cars
of the :United Electric Railways. The
sides of these Â¦ cars are streaked in a
way which suggests that salt water
had been sprinkled upqn them, but the
white spots cannot be removed, no mat
ter how hard they are rubbed, -_or. what
sort of solvents are used. The red paint
has * assumed a pale, pinkish hue in
some instances. The cars have not
been affected very, much, however. No
satisfactory explanation has been
found of this phenomenon. A chemist
said yesterday that when water runs
over varnish for a considerable time
arid with force the varnish is blistered
and loses the vigor of 'Â¦Â¦ Its coloring.
Another : suggested that, gases in the
air were forced down by the heavy fall
of : water and chemically affected the
paint" arid. varnish on cars and doors.â

Choicer and choicer are the stories
from Port Arthur. Only last week a
Russian officer. Lieutenant Prince
Radziwill, was telling us harrowing
tales of the manner in which Russians
and Japanese alike attack flags of
truce, and of a Japanese detachment
of 600 men which attempted to sur
render to^the Russians and hoisted a
white flag, only to be fired upon from
the Russians in front arid by the Jap
anese in the rear, the latter being dis
gusted at the idea of permitting a Jap
anese to surrender. The Russian
Prince 3ays that these luckless wights
lay dying between the Russian and
Japanese lines for several days. Occa
sionally one 'would rise up on* his el
bow, and then, "ping!" he would be
bowled over by a Russian or Japanese
bullet. That. story, sir, may properly
be called a jlm dandy 5 , a wonder, "a
corker and a crackajack. â Syracuse

homeless poor through the. medium of
the people's kitchens in Vienna, is now
visiting this country. Mr. Cohn, one of
the most prominent of Austrian finan
ciers, retired to devote himself to char
itable and sociological enterprises and
became interested in the first people's
kitchen in Vienna. I( is owing to his
zeal no less than his liberal contribu

a remarkable success. Mr. Cohn is one
of the most remarkable types of Aus

FRESNO, Nov. 24. â Tacoma won
two games to-day from Portland by
superior base running. Both games
were fast, but in many ways feature
less. Iberg autpitched Fitzgerald in
their game, but Tacoma won on ac
count of the perfect support given
Fitzgerald, something Iberg did .not
get- The extra run of the game, the
score of which was 3 to 2, was the
result of a rank error by Runkel in
the fourth Inning. The second game
was called at the end of the seventh
inning on account of darkness, the
score standing 3 to 1 in favor of the
Tacomaites. Scores:

LOS ANGELES. Nov. 21.â The season
of winter racing had an. auspicious
opening to-day at Ascot Park. Every
condition was favorable â the weather
perfect, the track fast and the fields
in the six events of good class. Only
two favorites won, but second choices
were heavily played at eood odds, and
it is probable the betting public broke
about even with the books. In spite
of the numerous holiday attractions a
crowd of 10,000 filled the grand
ttand, the lawns and the betting ring.
Twelve books, two field and one com
bination book handledâ or atterr.petd
to handle â the wagers of the bettors.
The race of most interest on the card
was the opening handicap at one mile.
Seven hordes faced the barrier, .Flo
Bob ruling favorite in the betting at
G to o, High Chancellor at 3 and
Ethelyne at 6. Princess Tulane was
loft at the post, but the others were
off well, with Flo Bob. High Chancel
lor and Ethelyne running- prominently.
At the stretch the fight began in earn
est, Ethelyne finally drawing away and
winning by a length from High Chan

STRENUOUS DAY
FOR PRESIDENT
In the morning the drag hounds of
the San Mateo County Hunt were out,
J. Downey Harvey acting as master.
The field wirs a small one. consisting of
Mr. Harvey. Miss Harvey and John
Lawson. The gallop . across country
after the hounds proved enjoyable.

will be played this afternoon at 3
o'clock on the Burljngame_ Country
Club field. The' teams. will line up:
Whitesâ Charley Dunphy, T.\A. Drls
coll, Cyril Tobin and John Lawson.
Redsr-R. M. Tobin. J. O. Tobin, F. D.
Hudson and Lawrence McCreery.
. Six periods of ten minutes' duration
each will be played.
The pony racing will be concluded to
morrow, when large fields are expected
to provide exciting sport. .Yesterday's
results In detail follow :
Quarter mil* â Won by Rudolph Spreckels'
Don (F. Skinner);. W. S. Hobart's Winnabelle
<L. .ileCrnkXVi. i-Â»iiind_: , Oi-arl-j WV Clirk.'J
Thomas A. Driscoll was presiding
judge, being ably assisted by Major J.
L. Rathbone and J. Downey Harvey.
R. J. Havey sent the fields away with
out delay. Robert Leighton was clerk
of the scales and handlcapper. Frank
Skinner and Charley Dunphy were the
star jockeys of the day. They each fin
ished first in three races, although the
latter was placed second for an unin
tentional foul.
Brilliant racing under ideal weather
conditions marked the first day of the
meeting of the California Polo and
Pony Racing Association yesterday at
the private course of Charles "W. Clark
at San Mateo. The sensation of the
day was the defeat of "Walter S. Ho
bart*8 pony, Silver Dick, which ha3 an
international reputation, '~ by Rudolph
Spreckels' great pony mare, Becky. The
distance was a quarter mile and-the
only other starter was W. E. Pedley'a
Queen Rucker.
Frank Skinner, who had the mount
on Becky, was the star among the gen
tlemen jockeys. He had a half length
the tjest of the start, an advantage he
increased to three lengths at the finish.
Queen Rucker beat Silver Dick for the
place. Becky was sent to the post in
superb condition and showed her class
for the first time.
The judges had a delicate duty to per
form after- the finish of the third
race. Charley Dunphy, on Althomer,
opened up a lead of three lengths at
the start and held it until well into the
stretch. Here he was challenged by
R. M. Tobin and Bas Blancs and there
was a slight bumping match. Mr. To
bin lodged a claim of foul and after
a long discussion it wa3 allowed by
the judges.
In the first race, at a quarter mile,
Frank Skinner on Rudolph Spreckels*
Don, outbroke his field and won easily
by three lengths.
Mr. Skinner also proved the most
alert at the post in the second race
when he rode hl3 recently purchased
pony. Lady Gay. He was riding hard
when Starter Dick Havey sent them
away and soon opened up a gap of three
lengths. Charley Dunphy en Brown
Peggy, saved considerable ground on
the stretch turn and in a whipping fin
ish was beaten three parts of a length.
Charley Dunphy had the . mount on
Maud H, the smallest pony at the races,
in the fifth event. He got her away
flying and hustled her along, until she
flew under the wire a clever winner.
Walter Hobart's Fanny Anderson ran
away going to the post, spoiling any
chances she may have had. ,;,;,
Bas Blancs, ridden by Dunphy. won
the three-quarter-mile race galloping,
never being headed from start to finish.
The races attracted a large and a
fashionable gathering. The Infield
fence was lined with automobiles and
smart equipages, while '. fashionahly
gowned women made the members'
stand bright with color. None of the
appointments. found on the- big metro
politan courses was missing and the
officials performed their duties like .vet
erans.

second round rather easily. The score
was 21-14.
The following practice matches were
played:
Mare Leads All
the Way to the
Wire.
The Seals waded in yesterday while
thft Commuters were still stalling
c round with their heads bowed and
pat in a claim for both games, neither
b*ir.g contested by the Commuters.
< Oakland is all in and the Tigers are as
pood as elected chamions. Scores â
Morning game â San Francisco, 2;
Oakland, 1 ; afternoon game â San
Francisco. 3; Oakland. 0.
Oakland never rallied in either
pane and the Seals made them look
like the rankest kind of bushers. The
b*st the once aspiring champions did
in the afternoon struggle was to get
three hits off Wheeler. At that one
of them was a scratch. They were
never in danger of doing ar^ything,
â¢while the Seals took advantage of the
first opportunity S.nd the game 'was
settled then and there.
Neither side had much of a license
to claim any runs till the seventh
Fpasrr.s, when the Seals did their good
Â¦work. Jones pitched a great game of
ball up to that time and it looked to
the fans as though one run would win
the game.
Irwin started the rally in the seventh
wilh a drive through second. Waldron
died easily, but Anderson clouted out a
f'.t.zIpt past Francks. Gochnauer could
not do a thing. Wilson, however, was
there with a clout over first, which let
Irwin in and sent Anderson to third.
The pair imlled off a clever double
steal on the next ball pitched, making
it two runs for the inning.
.Van Buren rounded the turn with
the Anal one for the Seals in round
elghi. He* beat out a. bunt and Hilde
brand sacrificed him along the line.
Irwin was the base hit kid for the
third time, sending Van Buren through
with one to short left field. The

cheers of 4000 people here to-day Bar
ney Oldfield drove his Peerless "Green
Dragon" racing car two separate miles
in 56 seconds fiat over a dust-laden
track. Tfce fntreDld Barney never fal

monster machine plunged and swerved
in a most obstinate manner several
times. Oldfleld's work was a revelation
to the Iovers*of the sport. The club de
cided to hold another meet In the
spring. There were eight events on the

hardwood tvees four or five feet in
diameter, with clear trunks eighty feet
up where the first limbs begin. As a
rule the largest trees have not been
felled, owing to'a lackÂ«pf facilities.
The 23,000,000 acres o( thg island of
Mindanao are almost entirely covered
by forest. At least 10,000,000 acres of
this Is virgin timber. The island of
Negro has been cut over thoroughly
for years, but attention is now being
given, there to forest preservation.
The Forestry Bureau has listed 665
species of native trees. Of most of
these little is known^but their names.
Some of them are used for paving
blocks and answer the purpose better
than stone. ,
In some places there are streams of
sufficient size to bring logs from the
forest tp tide water.
The insular Government has Issued
an illustrated pamphlet giving these
and many more facts about the Phil
ippine woods, and this is distributed to
visitors, to the exhibit here.

Two Kansas papers, the Wichita
Eagle and the Lawrence Gazette, are
trying to establish for William Mat
thewson of Wichita the right to the
title of "Buffalo BilK" now worn so
conspicuously by Colonel Cody. "Mat
thewson was known as 'Buffalo Bill*
long before Cody was heard of," de
clares the Gazette, "but Cody took the
name and "made money and fame out
of it, while Matthewson sought
neither. There is not an old settler
or the border but knows that Bill
Matthewson earned and for years car
ried the title . that afterward made
Cody famous." â Chicago Chronicle.

CHICAGO, Nov. 24. â Colonel Ellas

76 years.
Aged Journalist Answers Call.
Among Archie Roosevelt's chums is
a young gentleman who would seem to
have a hollow in his head where the
bump of veneration is usually found.
The President was chatting with a dis
tinguished caller the other day when
his telephone bell rang somewhat per
sistently. Appearances indicated that
attendants were busy in other parts of
the White House, so the President ex
cused himself and went to answer the
repeated call. This is the conversa
tion that took place on the line, ac
cording to the testimony of the dis
tinguished gentleman at the Presi
dent's end of it: "Well, what is it?"
"Hello. This is Jack. Is Archie
there?" "No, he's not." "Who's this
rm talking to?" '-'The President."
"Well, you'll do. Tell Archie to come
over and play ball." And the Presi
dent proceded to execute the order as
directed. â Chicago Chronicle.
The President Would "Do."
Garaventa" had only been in this
country a little over a year, having
come here from Italy, where he has a
wife and child.
He was employed at a cannery on
Seventh street and lived at B13 Potrero
avenue. His brother, Angelo. who has
been ten years in San Francisco and
lives at 449 Filbert street, is greatly up
set over the sad affair.
The weather, was clear and they had
a perfect view of the harbor, but they
could see nothing of the swimmer.
The two men stayed on the beach
till late in" the afternoon and finally
gave up "hopes of their companion re
turning. On their way back to the
city they met Patrolman E. H. Fair
weather, to whom they told the stery,
and to him they handed over Garaven
ta's effects. In the pockets of the
pants was found $7, a pipe and a ra
zor. - V^T
for the return of Garaventa. They
climbed up on the rocks and gazed
about the bay. â¢
In the southwestern^ islands there
are more \ than ; 4,000.000 Â¦' acres of pri
meyar forest, extending from the wat
er's edge ; to the ' summit of the moun
tains. A littlecutting has been done on
the. edges of belt. ; 'These
islands' are, celebrated for the great
quantities ; of ( narra; or ' Philippine ma
hogany,'' molaye and calantus, the
Philippine -"cedar. In ":Â¦'Â¦ this ) t forest] are
COUNTRY IS RICH IN WOOD.
The Filipino soldiery is to achieve a
social triumph before the fair clfl^es.
The proprietress of a large female sem
inary is to give a ball in their honor,
a nd the young ladies of the school will
entertain them, dancing being the main
amusement. All the enlisted men of the
constabulary are to be there.
Several of the children In the native
villages at the fair are to be adopted
by American families and remain in
this country.
When the woods from the Philippines
are placed on 'exhibition in the Com
mercial Museum In San Francisco In
quiry concerning the resources of the
Islands in this particular will be stimu
lated, and investigators will find facts
and figures that will surprise them.
There are 50,000,000 acres of forest land
In the Philippines. : More than '40,000^)00
acres of this is the property of the
United States. Pine, cedar, mahogany
and hundreds of other hard woods, val
uable dye woods 'and rubber and gutta
percha trees exist in immense quanti
ties. Under the system of forest pres
ervation in the islands only the full
grown trees can be cut, leaving t the
smaller trees to grow. The yearly
growth of new timber is placed , 'at
.1,400,000,000 cubic feetâ about ' three
times the cut, of timber in the United
States. A very small percentage of the
annual growth is beingutillzed.
A remarkable thing about the native
Filipinos at the' fair has been that
their health has been the best during
the cold weather. In _ the ' St. Louis
summer^ time, which one would think
the best for Filipinos, there was an
average of twenty-five a day on the
sick list. Now there are about five a
day. Some of the natives are used to
cold weather, as they live in the
mountains, where the thermometer
drops to 42. â :VÂ±
WILL ENTERTAIN FILIPINOS.
Under the law the Smithsonian Insti
tution has the first selection of the
materials, but through some oversight
the Philadelphia Museum, whose head
was for some time . chairmen of the
Philippine Board, was promised first
choice- It has been decided to give
them duplicates as far as possible, that
there may be no friction.
Some of the exhibits will go back to
the' islands. All the ethnological ma
terial will return there, though it will
probably make a stop at Portland. To
secure a first-class Philippine exhibit
frtm the material at hand at the Lou
isiana Purchase^ Exposition . will cost
the Oregon city in the neighborhood of
$40,000. '
Furniture men have been greatly in
terested in the various odd articles of
furniture made from bamboo that the
Filipino's exhibit. The popularity of
these articles with the public has
caused the American manufacturers to
look on them as quite salable and all
the bamboo In the buildings erected by
the Filipinos will be bought up .and
usffl in making furniture after the pat
tern of that exhibited.
. A. L. Lawshe of Wabash, Ind., audi
tor of the Philippine Islands, who was
sent here to take charge at a time
when It looked as if the financial re
sources of the Islands would- be, taxed
to carry on the exhibit, so great was
th'e salary roll and other expenses,
thinks the insular government will g-et
out with a total x expenditure of less
than- three-quarters of a million dol
lars. It was the original intention to
expend $500,000. The expense up to
September 30 was $1,320,485. The Louis
iana Purchase Exposition gave $189,
423 as aid and the receipts from va
rious sources to September 30 were
$312,000, leaving a total expense of
$819,042. Since September 30, great cuts
having been inaugurated, the expense
has been much less.^ The salvage from
the exhibit will amount to consider
able.
CALJ, BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING. WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS.
Nov. 24.â Several museums of the
country are to be enriched through the
Philippine exhibit at the World's Fair.
Large commercial museums, among
others, will secure material that is val
uable to them. All the institutions
that have applied for material will
send a man to select,- pack and ship
it. San Francisco has- made no direct
selection and has not arranged to send
any one to secure anything from the
Philippines as. far as known here, but
her commercial museums will get some
of the material, nevertheless.
The insular government is trying to
get out of its World's Fair venture
with as small an expenditure as pos
sible, its vaults not bulging with coin,
and it will give nothing away. Those
articles that it has no further use for
and the museums want, they must
purchase. Some of tne material the
Government will merely lend to mu
seums and reserve the right to v with
draw it whenever it wlsnes to make
another exhibit. In both cases the ex
pense of packing and shipping must
be paid' by the museums.
The polished woods, which have been
the marvel of all who have seen them,
are to be divided equally among eight
large cities. They will remain the
property of the insular government
San Francisco will get a share of them
arid a valuable addition will be made
to her museum thereby. The Smith
sonian Institution and the Field Mu
seum are among those which are to
receive valuable articles from the Phil
ippines.
SALARY ROLL IS CUT.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 24.â It was learned
to-night that Prince Fushimi, cousin of
the Emperor of Japan, recovered the
jewels, the report of which loss caused
general consternation yesterday. The
jewels were recovered in even a more
mysterious manner than they disap
peared.
The last seen of the Jewels, according
to members of the Prince's suite, was
when the Prince retired last Monday
night he laid them on a dressing table
in his apartments. Just previous to his
departure the day after. Prince Fushimi
and the members of his suite had been
absent from their* room for several
hours, the Prince was Informed that
the missing jewels had been found on a
table in an adjoining room in which, it
Is said, the* Prince had not been during
his stay in St. Louis.
An effort was made to maintain se
crecy in the recovery of the gems and
no report of the matter was made to
the local 'police or detective depart
ments.
Bla&lo Garaventa, an Italian lab
orer, went swimming in the bay yes
terday morning off Baker's Beach and
when about half a mile from s shore
suddenly disappeared from view and
has not been seen since. Garaventa,
with two companions, Andrew Podes
ta and Louis Patroni, were out for a
day's outing. When they arrived at
Baker's Beach some one suggested
that they gather mussels. Â¦
Garaventa went in swimming while
the others clambered about the rocks.
For a while he kept in close to shore
and seemed to be enjoying himself.
Suddenly he 'struck out toward the
channel. His two companions watched
him for a while and then went on try
ing to pick mussels off the rocks. Half
an hour elapsed and they began to look

this was arranged so \ that it would
sputter" out about 10 o'clock Just as if
I had extinguished it and retired for
the night. This I did because I dis
covered that the keepers were given to
watching, my .house for signs of my
leaving, and it was a long. time before
they found that a candle could go 'out
without human tfgency." *.

That a greater horror of war never
pervaded the earth than Is felt now In
the presence of the mighty struggle In
Manchuria is one good sign. The
glory of war is now seldom mentioned,
for the world is beginning to doubt the
reality of a glory that is based on the
destruction of human life. The great
est statesmen of to-day are called
great for their ability to maintain
peace rather than for th3ir capacity,
to conduct war. Furthermore, thejre
have never been greater efforts on tha
part of leaders of human thought .to
influence men and Governments for
peace than have been put forth dur-'
ing the past year. â Nebraska State

The supply of, pure ice in this coun
try for domestic purposes is not as
abundant or as available as it should
be and it Is absurd that practically the
only shop where it may be obtained is
that kept by the fishmonger, who keeps
it not for the purposes of consumption,
but for the cooling of fish. The fish
monger's shop does not always present
an environment that is, sanitarily
speaking, satisfactory; yet when ice
Is wanted In 6ickness or In health the
only tradesman that can be found to
supply it is the fishmonger and his
supply is usually limited. It seems
ridiculous that in the. English summer
the demand for ice should not be suffi
cient to warrant the-. establishment, of
a special agency for its supply.
We feel sure that if such a scheme
could be organized it would be widely
appreciated and would succeed as soon
as the public realized how much bet
ter and how much healthier it is to
have their food and beverages kept
cool during the days of a hot and sea
sonable summer. As It Is they have to
be content with semi-liquid butter and
mawkish luke ; warm beverages which
should be cold, especially those which
are aerated. A cheap and abundant
supply of pure Ice for domestic pur
poses would give the housekeeper a
chance of keeping a cool storeroom in
which meat, poultry, eggs and other
perishable articles of food could be pre
served. Not only would waste of food
be so prevented, but the ravages of the
putrefying agencies of hot weather
would be checked and the food saved
from becoming unwholesome if not pos
itively dangerous. In fact, we imagine
that nobody will deny the very great
advantages derived from keeping cer
tain, foods cold /in the summer and
preserving them In a state fit for'con
sumption and attractive. to the eye and
palate; and yet practically no steps are
taken to supply such an important and
very evident need. â London Lancet.

rejected suitors to get their presents
back. Become tired of this kind of
litigation, his Honor suggests that
when Cleveland swains make present
to maidens the following, contract
should be asrreed to: "It Is hereby
agreed that this (here the words
bouquet, hat, diamond riny or sou
venir spoon may be inserted) Is for
use only during the period of court
ship. It is hereby agreed that said
(bouquet, hat, etc.) shall be returned

Summing up the value of agricultur

get their raw material from. the. na
tional agriculture (iugar â¢ and : products
derived from it,* tobacco and its manu
factures, fruits, garden .truck, . minor
products and : products ;bf raising ani

to eay. 95 per cent of the to ta L . . ' * ;
per cent of our exports. The exporta
tion of other national products la in
creasing every day, offering new bases
for the greater stability of our eco

the value in foreign markets of our
two exportable, â¢ almost exclusive pro
ducts â sugar and tobacco.
In '1S93 the value of exports, other
than sugar and. tobacco, was $4,780,000,
whereas in 1903 It amounted to $9,300,

this sum about 53,000,000 are fruits and

The value of the tobacco exported
represents 33 per cent of the exports of
this year and amounts to $26,042,000,
against 525,400,000 In 1902. The increase
is due to the exportation of leaf to

Captain Alexander, like every .other good
American sailorman, prefers to eat his Thanks
giving dinner at home. He managed it yester
day and in making the effort to be here on
time brought the Santa Rosa up from San
Diego in just 39 hours. Last trip, when the
turkey eaten yesterday was strutting about
the barnyard acquiring the obesity -which de
cided its fate and led to its selection for the
Alexander platter, the Santa. Rosa was though*
to be doing well when she made the run in 42
hours. Captain Alexander's haste was not en
tirely selfish, however, for the Santa Rosa's
cabins were crowded with people, most of
whom had keen appetites and Thanksgiving
dinner engagements.

TO ARRIVE.
The schooner Webfqot, dismasted
and waterlogged, which was towed
Into Astoria Wednesday night by the
tug Wallula, is one of the oldest and
best known vessels in the coasting
trade. She was built in 1869 at Coos
Bay and for thirty-five years has been
In active commission. She was built
for and is still owned by the Simpson
Lumber Company. Formerly a bark
entine, she was converted some time
ago into a three-masted schooner. Her
career has been remarkably free from
mishap and since she slid from her
cradle at the Oregon seaport she has
earned much money for her owners.
The Webfoot was bound from Coos
Bay for this port. She encountered
heavy gales and November. 18 became
waterlogged. Three days later the
masts carried away and when picked
up by the steamer George W. Elder
Captain Lewis and his men had about
abandoned hope. The tug Wallula re
lieved the Elder of her tow and the
Webfoot is now safe in Astoria.
Three cf the crew, who left the boat
to seek assistance, are still missing
and little hope is entertained at As
toria for their safety.
At the time the men left the vessel
great seas were running and shipping
men are certain that the small boat
succumbed to the fury or the elements.
The men had been without food for
four days and also without water, and
unquestionably will have perished
from hunger by this time if the ocean
has not claimed them as victims. Mate
Bromer, Seaman J. O'Neil and another
sailor whose name is unknown com
prised the party who started off on the
forlorn expedition. There is a bare
possibility that they managed to
weather the seas and that a passing
steamer may have picked them up and
taken them to Puget Sound or to San
Francisco, but no one here doubts that
they have either starved to death or
been drowned.

In the first half. The Colorado-men
braced up In the first part of the second
half and shortly after the ball was in
play it looked as if Colorado would
score. By quick, snappy rushes the
Colorado men got the ball within fif
teen yards of the Stanford . goal.
There the local boys were penalized
fifteen yards for holding. This took
the snap out of them and Stanford's
goal was never In serious danger again.
The game was notable for its clean,
straightforward playing and 'also for
the number of men injured. Stan
ford suffered the most in this respect.
Van Sickle was the only man seriously
hurt. He had an arm broken shortly
after the game \ began. Bansbach,
Weller and West* of Stanford, and
Allen were also hurt and retired from
the game. None of them was seriously
injured, however.
The honors of the game for Stanford
were divided between Trowbridge,
Dole and Weller.
Trowbridge made two touchdowns

CHICAGO, Nov. Â£4.â Wisconsin 11,
Chicago 18, was the score to-day in
the hardest fought football game
played on Marshall FieJd this season.
The game was replete with surprises
and critical situations which kept the
18,000 spectators on the qui vlve from
the time of the first kick-off until the
final whistle blew.
The climax was reached in the mid
dle of the second half. Eckersall
caught the ball on the kick-off on Chi
cago's three-yard \ line and started
toward Wisconsin's goal. The Wiscon
sin men came thundering down upon
him. Some of them were stopped by
Chicago interference and others Eck
ersall dodged until only Stormquist,
Wisconsin's fullback, blocked the way
to a touchdown. Dodging dangerously
near the side line, the little Quarter
back rushed by the outstretched arms
of his opponent, grazing his leg as he
passed. Two seconds later he was be
neath a pile of squirming humanity
behind the Wisconsin goal posts. He
had made the record run of the sea
son, covering 107 yards, to do which
he actually made 115 yards. After the
ball had changed hands several times,
both sides punting often, Chicago final
ly got the ball on Wisconsin's ten-yard
line. A penalty imposed on Wisconsin
placed the ball on their five-yard line
and from here Bezedik went over for
a touchdown. Detray kipked goal.
The next play was Eckersall's sen
sational run for a touchdown, carrying
the ball from Chicago's three-yard line
tije length of the field. Kennedy
kicked the goal.
Instead \>t being discouraged, Wis
consin<fraced up and shortly after the
ball was in play they got it on their
own twenty-yard line. After working
it to Chicago's twenty-five-yard line,
Vanderboom got around the end and
"Wisconsin's second touchdown was
scored. Bush then kicked goal.
The balance of the half was a stub
born fight. Chicago finally carrying the
ball to Wisconsin's one-yard line? Wis
consin contesting every inch of the
ground and finally holding for downs
hardly three feet from their goal line.
The ball was punted out of danger and
the half ended with it on Wisconsin's
six-yard line in their possession.

entertainment was. that which was held
by the Building Trades Council at Its
headquarters on Mission street last
night. It was officially announced that
the heavyweight representatives from

their skill in the building up of this
g;reat western city.
President P. H. McCarthy occupied
the chair and beside him were Presi
ident Gompers of the American Fed
eration of Labor and. other officials
from beyond the Rockies.
â¢ In a thirty-minute speech Gompera >
paid a- high compliment to the men
connected with the local trades unions
of this city. He hoped that the spirit
of unionism, ndt only in the United
States but all over the earth shall
extend and spread until the working
class shall be elevated to the plane of
manhood and Independence, yet ready
and willing to concede to others that
which rightly belongs to them.

Mrs. McElhinny had worked in the
Cornwall family for some time and hau
always been regarded as'a fatihful
servant. She retired to her room short
ly after noon yesterday, and about 5:30
o'clock the cook, Mary Miller, : an
nounced dinner* Receiving no response
from the chambermaid's room, Miss
Freda Meyers and Miss Annie Meyers,
two other domestics, went upstairs to
call her. When . the young women
reached the room they found Mrs. Mc-
Elhinny lying on !Â¦ a. sofa, and, after
some difficulty, aroused her. .-She had,
to^all appearances, been drinking, but
she heeded their . advice and started
downstairs. On the top stair the wo
man stumbled. She. was .unable to re
gain her footing, and plunged to the
bottom of the flight, which consisted of
twelve stairs.
In a short time help was. summoned,
but it was found that the woman was
beyond earthly help and without doubt
had been Instantly killed. Deputy Cor
oners Meehan and Murphy were called
and made an Investigation.
Mrs. Sarah McElhinny. 4t) years of
age and a chatnbermald at the home of
Airs. P. B. Cornwall, 2301^ Pacific ave
nue, fell downstairs in the house of
her mistress yesterday evening and
fractured her skull. Death resulted al
most instantlji. According to the story
cf other domestics, the unfortunate
woman was Intoxicated at the time of
the accident. She had spent the aft
ernoon in her room, and when called for
dinner staggered to the head of the
stairway, from which she fell to- her
death. â¢ . - <â¢
The policemen who were first on the
scene say that the driver of the horse
was drinking. This the latter denies.
Some comment is made on the action
of the company in not hurrying the
work, and it was remarked that an or
dinance should be passed requiring
that street work of this charactef
should be rushed night and day until
completed.
A s<juad of police was required to
keep the crowd back while the animal
was being extricated from its position.
After being released from the harness
the horse worked itself beneath the rails
and, in a cramped position, resisted all
attempts to rescue him. The animal
ambulance people made .several at
tempts but without success. Still the
cars were blocked a distance of several
blocks and three systems were tied up.
At length a rope was attached to the
hind legs of the quadruped and about
fifty strong men dragged him to the
surface.
A peculiar accident occurred at the
corner of Clay and Kearny streets last
night, and resulted in the delay of
street car traffic for more than two
hours. For the last week employes of
the United Railroads have been repair-
Ing the tracks at this particular loca
tion and have excavated the street to
the depth of about four feet. Although
red lights were displayed Frank Schelly
of AVt Scotland street and Harry Pres
ton of 701 Montgomery avenue drove
a horse belonging to the Water Front
Stables into the opening and came to
grief.
Fred Adams, a waiter on the
steamer Sonoma, reported yesterday
to Policeman Bakulich that shortly
after 4 o'clock yesterday morning two
bo$% about IS years of age attacked
him at Battery and Union streets.
They knocked him down and went
through his pockets, taking $18 in
coin and a silver watch. He was sent
to the Harbor Emergency Hospital by
Bakulich, where a lump on his jaw
and a cut on his cheek were dressed.
Samuel Fredericks, who lives at 79
Stevenson street, reported that he was
held up by two men at Powell and
Eddy streets about 2 o'clock yester
day morning. He was struck on the
head, he said, with some blunt instru
ment and knocked down. His watch
and some money were taken from
him. â¢ He was sent to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where two
wounds in his scalp were stitched and
dressed.
The unusual number of hold-ups on
Wednesday night and early yesterday
morning has caused activity among
the detectives and special duty men.
It is thought that the criminals were
not professional footpads, but young
hoodlums, who were desirous of se
curing funds to spend on Thanks
giving.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, .NOVEMBER 25,' 1904.
President Wheeler, when questioned
concerning the story of White's alleged
dismissal, salVl that Hale has thus fa?
been the only student to be given no
tice of such action In his case, and thai
Mr. White had not yet been suspended
by the university authorities.
M. C. A. news on the front page of hij
paper until the Blue and Gold printed,
in derision o* that practice, divers car
toons and witticisms relating to the
editor's leanings toward Christian As
sociation news. White Is now presldeni
cf the College T. M. C. A.
He said to-day that he had not heard
of his suspension, and If ho had beer
dismissed temporarily from the uni
versity notice had not yet been sent
to him.
White's excuses were deemed unsat
isfactory by Captain Nance, and when
H.ile was suspended yesterday the be
lief was expressed that White would
bo the next man to feel the sharp edge
of the oflic!al guillotine.
Last year White was editor of the
same college paper which this year
proved to be the undoing of Hale â in
that It gave the latter opportunity tÂ»
express unwelcome criticisms of the
university faculty. White, however,
was looked upon as a conservative ed
itor, it being his babit to "feature" Y.
The suspension t was supposed to be
similar to that which W. T. Hale, ed
itor of the Dally. Californian, has been
ordered to undergo. White was charged
with failure to obey Captain Nance's
marching orders and with having par
ticipated in a riot on the campus fol
lowing'the order of the military in
structor to the seniors to fall Into line
in front of North Hall and from there
proceed In soldierly style to the class
room, where the new commandant was
prepared to lecture on tactics and mil
itary science. .

The agonizing itching and burning

&nd crusting of the scalp, as in ecalled
