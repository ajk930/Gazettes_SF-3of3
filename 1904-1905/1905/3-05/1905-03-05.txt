IT was in the spring of the : year ISM
that all London was Interested; and
the fashionable world dismayed, by
"the murder of the Hon. Ronald
Adair under most unusual and in
explicable circumstances. The public
has already learned those particulars
of the,crime which, camejjutJa^hXpo
lice investigation.' but a good deal 'â¢'aw
suppressed iipon that occasion, since
â¢ the case for the prosecution was so
overwhelmingly strong that it was not
* necessary to bring forward all the
facts. Only now, at the end cf nearly,
ten years, am I allowed to supply those
missing links which make up the whole
_of that remarkable. chain. The crime
was of interest in itself, but that in
terest was as nothing to be compared
to the inconceivable sequel, which af
| forded me the greatest shock and sur-.
r*"ise of any event in my adventurous
life. Even now, after this long inter
val, I find myself thrilling as I think
of it, and feeling once more that sud
den flood of joy, amazement and in
". â¢credulity which utterly eubmerged my
mind. Let me say to that public,
which has shown some interest in
â¢ those glimpses which I have occasion
ally given them of the thoughts and
actions of a very remarkable man,
that they are not to blame me if I
have not shared my knowledge with
them, -for 1 should have considered it
ray first duty to have done so had I not
been barred by a positive prohibition
from his own lips, which was only
withdrawn upon the third of last
. ' month.
It can be imagined that my close in
â¢'. timacy with Sherlock Holmes had in
terested me deeply in crime, and that
after his disappearance I never failed
to -ad with care the various problems
â¢which came before, the public. And I
even attempted, more than once, for
my own private satisfaction, to employ
his methods in their solution, though
. . with indifferent success. There was
â¢ none, however, which appealed to me
. like this tragedy of Ronald Adair. As
I read the evidence at the inquest,
which led up' to a verdict of willful
' murder against some person or persons
unknown, I realized more clearly than
. I -had ever done the loss which the
community had sustained by the death
â¢ of. Sherlock Holmes. There were
j>otnts '-bout this strange business
\ which -vcald, I was sure, have special
. ly appealed to him, and the efforts of
the police would have been supple
mented, or more probably anticipated,
by the trained observation and the
alert mind of the first criminal agent
in Europe. All day, as I drove upon
my round, I turned over the case in
my mind, and found no explanation
â¢ which appeared to me to be adequate.
At the risk of telling a twice-told tale
I will recapitulate the facts as they
were known to the public at the con
. elusion of the Inquest.
The Hon. Ronald Adair was Ihe sec
\ ond son of the Earl of Maynooth, at
that time Governor of one of the Aus
tralian colonies.- Adair's mother had
returned from Australia to undergo
the operation for cataract, and she, her
â¢* Boa Ronald and her daughter Hilda
were living together at 427 Park Lane
1 The youth moved in the best fo

â¢.no Enemies. and no particular,
vices. He had been engaged to
- Miss Edith Woodley of Carstairs but
* the engagement had been broken off by
mutual consent some months before,
and there was no sign that it had left
any very profound feeling . behind it.
. For the rest the man's life moved
. In* a narrow and ; conventional circle,'
. for his habits -were quiet and bis na
ture unemotional. Yet It was upon this
-easy-going young aristocrat that death
came. In most strange and unexpected
form, between the hours of ten" and
elevÂ«n-twenty on . the ' night - of March
30, 1894. - : ' 7, ' â¢ . ;â â  â 'â

he was a cautious- player.'.'and usually
rose a winner. --It - came . out '. in cvi- ;
dence that, in partnership with I . Colonel'
Mcran. he had : actually won/as much
' as four hundred and twenty pounds
in a Fitting, some weeks -before, from
Godfrey Milner and Lordv Balmoral.
So much for his recent history as it
came out at the inquest. ;'.%â â  :
On the evening of the crime, he re
, turned from the club exactly at ten.
His mother end; sister were out spend
ing the evening with a relation. The
servant deposed that she heard him
enter the front room :on the second
floor, generally used as his- sitting
room. She had lit a fire there, and as
it smoked she had opened the window.
No sound was heard â¢-> from the. \ room
until eleven-twenty,- the ' hour of â¢ the
return of Lady. Maynooth and - her
daughter. Desiring, to say good-night,
she attempted to enter her son's room.
The door was locked on the inside and
no answer could be got to their cries
and knocking. Help was obtained and
the door forced. ,â ' The unfortunate
young man was ' found lying near the
! table. His head had been horribly mu
tilated by an expanding revolver bul
let, but no weapon of : any sort was to
be found in the room. On the table
lay two banknotes for ten pounds each
and seventeen pounds, ten in silver and
gold, the money arranged in little' piles
of varying amount. There were some
figures also upon a sheet of paper,
with the names of some club â¢ friends
opposite to them, from which It was
conjectured j that before his death- he
was endeavoring to make out his losses
or winnings at. cards. .
A minute examination of the circum
stances "served only to make the case
more complex. In the first place, no
reason could: be given why the young
man . should have fastened : the - door
upon the inside. There was. the possi
bility that the murderer had done this,
and had afterward escaped by the
window. â¢ The drop was at least twenty
feet, however, and a "bed of crocuses
â in full bloom' lay beneath. Neither the
flowers .nor the earth showed any sign
of having been disturbed,; nor were
there any marks upon the narrow strip
of . grass which separated . the house
from , the road. Apparently, therefore,
it was "the young man himself who had
fastened the door. But how did he
come by his death? No one could have
s climbed up. to the window, without.
; leaving ' traces. Suppose ; .a . man had
fired â¢ through the r window, he would
Indeed be â¢?". a remarkable shot who
could with a revolver inflict so deadly
a wound. ' Again; Park Lane is a
frequented " thoroughfare; there .'J is
a : . cabstands- II within ;;> a hundred
yards of :â '. the - house. No â¢ one
had heard' ,a'.v shot. '^ And yet there
was the dead man, and there the re
volver bullet, which had mushroomed
out, 'as soft-nosed bullets and so
inflicted â¢ a wound - wfhich ,' must have
caused instantaneous death; . Such were
the circumstances' .' of the Park Lane
mystery, which were further compli
cated by entire absence .'of motive,
: since, as I have said, young Adair was
, not known to have : any enemy, and no
attempt had been made to remove the '
: money or valuables in the room. -
â  All day, I turned \ these facts ; over in
my mind, " endeavoring to . ' . hit upon
some theory V which ?< could ', reconcile
them all. and to find that line of > least
. resistance which â¢ my poor âº friend * had
declared to be the ; starting, point of
every investigation. I confess that I
made little progress. In the i evening
" I ; strolled across the p park I and found
myself about â 6 â¢, o'clock at the * Oxford
" street end of Park Lane. n A.' group of
loafers upon the pavements, all staring 1
up at a particular window, directed me
to the; house ; which I had come 'to see. ;

whom I : strongly r suspected â¢of being , a
plain-clothes detective, was -r pointing

EMPTY
HOUSE
others crowded round to listen to what
he said. I got as near him as I could,
but his observation? seenied to me to
be absurd, so I withdrew again in some
disgust. As I did so I struck against
an elderly, deformed man, who had
been behind me, and I knocked down
several books whcfh he was carrying.
I remember that as I picked them up
I observed the title of one of them,
"The Origin of Tree Worship," and it
struck me that the fellow must be
some poor bibliophile, who, either as
a trade or as a hobby, was a collec
tor of obscure volumes. I ertdeavored
to apologize for the accident, but it
was evident that these books which I
had so unfortunately maltreated were
very precious objects in the eyea of
their owner. With a snarl of contempt
he turned upon his heel, and I saw his
curved back and white sidewhiskers
disappear among the throng.
My observations of 427 Park Lano
did little to clear up the problem in
which I was interested. The house
was separated from the street by a
low wall and railing, the whole not
more than five feet high. It was per
fectly easy therefore for any one to
get Into the garden, but the window
was entirely inaccessible, since there
was no waterpipe or anything which
could heli) the most active *man to
climb it. More puzzled than ever I re
traced my steps to Kensington. I had
not been in my study five minutes
when the maid entered to say that a
person desired to see me. To my as
tonishment it was none other than my
strange old book collector, his sharp,
wizened face peering out from a frame
of white hair and his precious volumes,
a dozen of them at least, wedged un
der his right arm.
"You're surprised to Bee me, Blr,"
said lie in a strange, croaking voice.
I acknowledged that I was.
"Well, I've a conscience, sir, and
when I chanced to see you go into this
house as I came hobbling after you
I thought to myself I'll just step in
and ccc that kind gentleman and tell
him that if I was a bit. gruff in my
manner there was not any harm meant
and that I am much obliged to him for
picking up my books."
'"You make too much of a trifle," said
I. "May 1 ask how you knew who I
was?"
"Well, sir, if it isn't too great a lib
erty, I am a neighbor of youra, for
you'll find ray little bookshop at thÂ«
corner of Church street, and very
happy to see you,' "I am sure. May
be you collect yourself, sir. Here's
'British Birds' and _â¢ 'Catullus' and
'The Holy War'- â a bargain, every one
of them. With five volumes you could
just fill that gap on tint second shelf.
It looks untidy, does it not, sir?"
I moved ray head to look at the
cabinet behind me. When I turned
again, Sherlock Holmes was standing
smiling at me across my study table.
I rose to my feet, stared at him for
some seconds in utter amazement, and
then it appears that I must have
fainted for the first and the last time
In my life. Certainly a gray mist
swirled before my eyes, and when it
cleared I found my collar-ends undone
and the tingling after-taste of brandy
upon my lips. Holmes was bending
over my chair, his llaak in his hand.
"My dear Watson," said the well
remembered voice, "I ovftyou a thou-

Band apologies. I had no idea that
you would be so affected."
I gripped him by the arms.
"Holmes!" I cried. "Is it really
you? Can it indeed be that you are
alive? Is it possible that you succeed
ed in climbing out of that' awful
abyss ?"
" Wait a moment," said he. "Are
you sure that you are really fit to
discuss things? I have given you a
serious shock by my unnecessarily
dramatic reappearance."
"I am all right, but indeed. Holmes,
I can hardly believe my eyes. Good
heavens! to 'think that youâ you of
ah men â should be standing in my
study." Again I gripped him by the
sieeve, and felt the thin, sinewy arm
beneath it. 'â¢V.'ell, you're not a spirit,
anyhow." said I. "My dear chap, I'm
overjoyed to see you. Sit down, and
tell me how you came alive out of
that dreadful chasm."
He sat opposite to me. and lit a
cigarette in his old, nonchalant man
ner. He was dressed in the seedy
frock-coat of the book merchant, but
tho rest of that individual lay in a pile
of white hair and old books upon the
table. Holmes looked even thinn-r
and keener than of old. but there was
a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face
which told me that his life recently
had not been a healthy one.
"I am glad to stretch myself. Wat
son," said he. "It is no joke when a
tall man has to take a foot off hi 3
stature for several hours on end. Now,
my dear fellow, in the matter of these
explanations, we have, if I may ask
for your co-operation, a hard and
dangerous night's work in front of us.
Perhaps it would 1 be better if I gave
you an account of the whole situation
When' that work is finished."
"I am full of curiosity. I should
much prefer to hear now."
"You'll come with me to-night?"
"Wfcfen you like and where you
like."
"This is. indeed like the old days.

I listened with amazement to this
explanation, which Holmes delivered
between the puffs of his cigarette.

with m> own eyes, that two went
down the path and none returned."
- lt came about in this way. The in
stant that the professor had disap

three others whose desire for venje

by the death <>f their leader. They were
ali most dangerous men. One or other

which I conducted in a laboratory at

Having concluded this to my satisfac
tion, and learning that only one of my
enemies was now left in London, I was
about to return when my movements
were hastened by the news of this very
remarkable Park Lane mystery, which
not only appealed to me by its own
merits, but which >--<.-nitd tÂ«> offer some
most peculiar personal opportunities.
I came over at MUI to London, called
in my own person at Baker street,

â  â¢ Such was the remarkable narrative
â¢to which 1 listened on that April even
ing â narrative which would have
â  been utterly incredible to me had it
not been confirmed by the actual sight
of the tall, spare figure and the keen,
â eager face, which I had never thought
to see again. In some manner he had
learned of mv own sad bereavement,
. and his sympathy â Â»â¢ shown in . his
manner rather than in his words.
â¢"Work is the best antidote to sorrow,
my dear Watson," said he; "and I
have a piece of woik for us both to

â¢ 1 had imagined that we were bound

the' cab - at the corner of Cavendish

to right and left, and at every subse

â¢."pains to assure thÂ£t he was not fol-
MWM. Cur route was certainly a sin
\ C^ular ore. Holmes' knowledge of the
' byways of London was extraordinary,
and on this occasion he passed rapidly
â¢ and with an assured step through a
network of mews and stables, the very
â¢existence of which I had never known.
'We emerged at last into a small road,
.lined with old. gloomy houses, which
led us Into Manchester street, and so
*to B!andfoid street. Here he turned
swiftly down a narrow passage, passed
through a wooden gate into a deserted
yard, and then opened with a key the
â¢. back door of a house. We entered to

The place was pitch dark, but it was
evident to me that it was an empty

right, ar.d we found ourselves in a
large, square, empty room, heavily
shadowed in the corners, but faintly
lit in the centre from the lights of the
street beyond. There was no lamp
near, and the window was thick with
dust, so that we could only Just dis

companion put his hand upon my
shoulder and his lips close to my ear.

whispered. *

of absence has entirely taken away

I ercpt forward and looked across at
the famiHnr window, As my eyes fell
upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of
amazement. The blind was down, and
a stron? light was burning in the
room. The shadow of a man who was
seated in a chair within was thrown
In hard, black outline upon the lumi
nous screen of the window. There was
r.o mistaking the poise of the head, the
squareness of thÂ°. shoulders, the
sharpness of the features. The face
was turned half-round, and the effect
was that of one of those black sil
houettes which our grandparents loved
t' frame. Tt was a perfect reproduc
tion of Holmes. Pu amazed was I that
I threw out my hand to make sure that
the men himself was standing besi>:Â«

laughter. â¢
"Well?" said he.
"Good heavers!" I cried. "It Is
marvelous."
"I trust that ape doth not wither nor

"I should be prepared to swear that
it was you."
"The credit of the execution is due
to Monsieur Oscar Meunier of Greno

I arranged myself during my visit to
Haker street this afternoon."
"But why?"
"Because, my dear Watson, I had the
strongest r-ossible reason for wishing
certain people to think chat I was
there when 1 was really elsewhere."
"And you thought the rooms were
watched?"
"I knew that they were watched."
"By whom?"
'"By my old enemies, Watson. By
the charming society whose leader lies
in the Reichenbach Fall. You must
remember that they knew, and only
they knew, that I was still alive. Soon
or or later they believed that I should
cftre back to my rooms. They watched
them continuously, and. this morning
they saw me arrive."
How do you know?" .
"Because I recognized their sentinel
when I glanced out my window. He is
a harmless enough fellow, Parker. by
name, a garroter by trade, and a re
markable performer upon the jews
harp. I cared nothing for him. But I
cared a great deal for the much more
formidable person who was behind
him. the bosom friend of Morlarty, the
man who dropped the rocks over the
cliff, the most cunning and dangerous
criminal in London. That is the man
who is after me to-night. Watson, and
that is the man who is quite unaware
that we are after him."
My friends plans were gradually re
vealing themselves. From this "con
venient retreat the watchers a ore V>
ing watched and the trackers tracked.
That anr.ular shadow up yonder was
the bait, and we were the hunter.-. In
rilence we stood together In the dark
ness and watched the hurrying figures
who passed and repassed in front of
us. Holmes- was silent and motionless;
but I could tell that he was keenly
alert, and that his eyes were fixed In
tently upon the stream of passersby.
It was a bleak and boisterous night,
and the wind whistled shrilly down ihe
long street. Many people were moving
to and fro. most of them muffled in
their coats and cravats. Once or
twice it seemed to me that I
had seen the same figure be
fore, and I especially noticed
two men who appeared to be sheltering
themselves from the wind in the door
way of a house some distance up the
street. I tried to draw my compan
ion's attention to them, but he gave
a little ejaculation of impatience and
continued to stare into the street.
More than once he fidgeted with his
feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers
upon the wall. It was evident to me
that he was becoming uneasy and that
his plans were not working out alto
gether as he had hoped. At last, as
midnight approached and the street
gradually cleared, he paced up and
down the room in uncontrollable agi
tation. I was about to make some re
mark to him, when I raised my eyes
to the lighted window, and again ex
perienced almost as great a surprise
as before. I clutched Holmes' arm
and pointed upward.
"The shadow has moved!" I cried.
It was indeed no longer the profile,
but the back, which was turned to
ward us.
Three years had certainly not
smoothed the asperities of his temper
or his impatience with a less active
intelligence than his own.
"Of course it has moved," said he.
"Am I such a farcical bungler, Watson,
that I should erect an obvious dummy
and expect that some of the sharpest
men in Europe would be deceived by
it? We have been in this room two
hours and Mrs. Hudson has malt
some change in that figure eight times,
or once in every quarter of an hour.
She urorki it from the front, so that
her shadow may never be seen. Ah!"
He drew in his breath with a shrill,
â¢ xeited intake. In the dim light I saw
his h.-ad thrown forward, his whole
attitude rigid with attention. Outside
the street was absolutely deserted.
Thost two men might still be crouch
ing in the doorway, but I could no
longer see them. All was stilly and
dark, save only that brilliant yellow
screen in front of us with the black
figure 'utlined upon its center. Again
in the utter silence I heard that thin,
sibilant note which spoke of intense
suppressed excitement. An instant
later he pulled me back into the black
est cornea of the room and I felt his
warning hand upon my lipa. The fin
gers which clutched me were quiver
ing. Never had I known my friend
more moved and yet the dark street
still stretched lonely and motionlesa
before us.
But suddenly I was aware of that
which his keener senses had already
distinguished. A low, stealthy sound
came to my ear, not from the direction
of Baker street, but from the back of
the very house in which we lay con
cealed. A door opened and shut. An
instant later steps crept down the
passageâ steps which were meant to be
silent, but which reverberated harshly
through the empty house. Holmes
crouched back against the wall and I
did fhe same, my hand closing upon
the handle of my revolver. Peering
through the gloom I saw the vague
outline of a man a shade blacker
than the biacknesÃ of the ooen door.
He stood for an instant and then he

crept torward, crouching, menacing
into the room. He was within three
yards of us, this sinister figure, and I
had braced myself to meet his spring
before I lealized that he had no idea
of our presence. He passed close be
side us, stole over to the window and
very softly and noiselessly raised it for
half a foot. As he sank to the level of
this opening, the light of the street,
no longer dimmed by the dusty glaas,
fell full uoon his face. The man
seemed to be beside himself with ex
citement. His two eyes shone like
stars and his features were working
convulsively. He was an elderly man,
with a rhin. projecting nose, a high,
bald forehead and a huge grizzled
mustache. An opera hat was pushed
to the back of his head and an evening
dress shirt-front gleamed out through
his open overcoat. His face was
gaunt and swarthr, scored with deep,
savage lines. In his hand he carried
wh:u appeared to be a stick, but as
he laid it flown upon the floor it gave
a metallic clang. Then from the
pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky
object, and he busied himself in some
task which ended with a loud, sharp
click, as if a soring or bolt had fallen
into its place. Still kneeling upon the
floor he bent forward and threw all
his weight and strength upon
some lever, with the result
that there came a long, whirl
ing, grinding noise, ending once more
in a powerful click. He straightened
himself u^ then, and I saw that wliiit.
he held in his hand was assort off^jl
gun with ji curiously misshapen butt.
He opened it at the breech, put some
thing in and snapped the breech
block. Then, crouching down, ,htt
rested the end of the barrel upon r thÂ«
ledge of the open window, and I saw
his long mustache droop over the stock
and his eye gleam as it peered along
the sights. I heard a little sigh of
satisfaction a3 he cuddled the butt
into his shoulder and saw that arnuz
ing target, the black man on the yel
low ground, standing clear at the end
of his fore-sight. For an instant ho
was rigid and motionless. Then hia
finger tightened on the trigger. TherÂ»
was a strange, loud whiz and, a long,
silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that
instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on
the marksman's back and hurled him
flat upon hiÃ face. He was up
again in a moment and with convul-
sive strength he seized Holmes by the
throat, but I struck him on the head
with the butt of my revolver and
he dropped again upon the floor. I
fell upon him, and as I held him my
comrade blew a shrill call unon a
whistle. There was the clatter ot
running feet upon the pavement and
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
two policemen in uniform, with one
plain clothes detective, rushed
through the front entrance and into
the room.
"That you. Lestrade?" said Holme 9.
"Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the Job
myself. It's good to see you back in
London, sir."
"I think you want a little unofficial
help. Three undetected murders in
one year won't do, Lestrade. But you
handled the Molesey mystery with less
than your usualâ that's to say, you
handled it fairly well."
We had all risen to our feet, our
prisoner breathing hard, with a stal
wart constable on each side of him.
Already a few loiterers had begun to
collect in the street. Holmes stepped
up to the window, closed it and
dropped the blinds. Lestrade had pro
duced two candles and the policemen
had uncovered their lanterns. I was
able at last to have a good look at
our prisoner.
It was a tremendously virile and
yet sinister face which was turned
toward us. With the brow of a phi
losopher above and the jaw of a sensu
alist below, the man must have started
with great capacities for good or for
evil. But one could not look v.ion hi.s
cruel blue eyes, with their drooping,
cynical lids, or upon the fierce, ag
gressive nose and the threatening,
deep-lined brow without reading na
ture's plainest dangar signals. He took
no heed of any of us, but his eyes wer^
fixed upon HolmeB 1 face w'th an ex-
presslon in -wjhich hatred and amaze
ment were equally blended. "You
fiend!" he kept on muttering, "you
clever, clever fiend!"
"Ah, colonel!" said Holmes, arrang
ing his rumpled collar, " 'journeys end
in lovers' meeting,' as the old play
says. I don't think I have had thi
pleasure of seeing you since you fa
vored me with those attentions as I
lay on the ledge above Reichenbach
Fall."
The colonel still stared at my friend
like a man in a trance. "You cun
ning, cunning flend!" was all that he
could say.
"I have not introduced you yet,"
said Holmes. "This, gentlemen, is
Colonel Sebastian Moran, once of her
Majesty's Indian army, and the best
heavy game shot that our Eastern em
pire has ever produced. I believe I
am correct, colonel, in saying that
your bag of tigers still remains un
rivaled ?"
The fierce old man said nothing, but
still glared at my companion. With
his savage eyes and bristling mustache
he was wonderfully like a tiger him
self.
"I wonder that my very simple
stratagem could deceive so old a shi
kari," said Holmes. "It must be very
familiar to you. Have you not teth
ered a young kid under a tree, lain
above it with your rifle and waited for
the bait to bring up your tiger? This
empty house is my tree and you are
my tiger. You have possibly had
other guns in reserve in case there
should be several tigers or in the un
likely supposition of your own aim
failing you. These," he pointed
around, "are my other guns. The
parallel is exact."
Colonel Moran sprang forward w-ith
a snart of rage, but the constables
dragged him back. The fury upon his
face waa terrible to look at.
"I confess that you had one small
surprise for me," said Holmes. "I
did not anticipate that you would
yourself make use of this empty house
and this convenient front window. I
had imagined you as operating from
the street, where my friend Lestrade
and his merry men were awaiting you.
With that exception all has gone as I
expected."
Colonel Moran turned to the official
detective.
"You may or may not have just
cause for arresting me," said he, "but
at least there can be no reason why
I should submit to the gibes of this
peraon... If I am in the hands of the
law let things be done in a legal way."
"Well, that's reasonable enough,"
said Lestrade. "Nothing further you
have to say, Mr. Holmes, before we
go?"
Holmes had picked up the powerful
airgun from the floor and was exam
ining ita mechanism.
"An admirable and unique weapon,"
said he, "noiseless and of tremendous
power. I knew Yon Herder, the blind
German mechanic who constructed it
to the order of the late Professor Mo
riarty. For years I have been aware
of its existence, though I have never
before had the opportunity of hand
ling it. I commend it very specially
to your attention, Lestrade, and also
the bullets which fit it."
"Tou can trust us to look after that,
Mr. Holmes," said Leatrade as the
whole r>arty moved toward the door.
"Anything further to say?"
"Only to ask what charge you in
tend to nrefer ?"
"What charge, sir? Why, of course,
the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock
Holmes."
"Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose
to appear in the matter at all. To
you, and to you only, belongs the
credit of the remarkable arrest which
you have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I
congratulate you! With your usual
happy mixture of cunning and auda
city you have got him."
"Got him! Got whom, Mr. Holmes?"
"The man that the whole force haa
been seeking in vain â Colonel Sebas
tian Moran, who shot Hon. Ronald
Adair with an expanding burlet from
an airgun through the open window
of the second floor front of No. 427
Park Lane, upc-n the 30th of last
month. That's the charge, Lestrade.
And now, Watson, if you can endure
the draught from a broken window.
I think that half an hour in my study
over a cigar may afford you some
profitable amusement."
Our old chambers had been left un
changed through the supervision of
Mycroft Holmes and the immediate
care of Mrs. Hudson. As I entered I
saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness,
but the old landmarks were all in their
place. There was the chemical cor
nei and the acid-stained, deal-topped
table. There upon a shelf was the
row of formidable scrap-books and
becks of reference which many of our
fk llow-citizens would have been so
glad, to burn. The diagrams, the
v.olin-case. and the pipe-rack â even
the Persian slipper which contained
the tobacco â all met my eyes as I
glanced round me. There were two
occupants of the room â one, Mrs.
Hudson, who beamed upon us both as
we entered â the other, the strange
dummy which had played so im
portant # a part in the evening's ad
ventures. It was a wax-colored model
of my friend, so admirably done that it
wa.s a perfect fac simile. It stood on
a small" pedestal table with an old
dressing-gown of Holmes' so draped
round it that the illusion from the
street was absolutely perfect.
"I hope you preserved ill precau
t'ons, Mrs. Hudson?" said Holmes.
"I went to it on my knees, sir, just
as you told me."
"Excellent. You carried the thing
out very well. Did you observe where
the bullet went?"
"Yes. sir. I'm afraid it has spoiled
your beautifu} bust, for it passed right
through the head and flattened itself
on the wall. I picked it up from the
carpet. Here it is!"
Holmes held it out to Â»me. "A soft
rt'volver bullet, as you perceive, Wat
sun. There's genius in that, for who
would expect to find such a thing fired
frcm an air-gun. All right, Mrs. Hud
son. I am obliged for your assistance.
And now, Watson, let me see you in
your old scat once more, for there are
several points which I should like to
discuss with you."
He had thrown off the seedy frock
coat, and now he waa the Holmes oÂ£
ola in the mouse-colored dressing
gown which he took from his etfi#y.
"The old shikari's nerves have not
lost their steadiness, nor his eyes their
keenness," 3aid he, with a laugh, aa
he inspected ike shattered forehead ot
hia bust.
"Plumb in the middle of thÂ« ba^lc
of the head and smack through the
brain. He waa the oest shot in India,
and I ext.ect that there are few better
in London. Have you heard the
name .'"
"No, I have not."
"Well, well, such i 3 fame! But.
then, if I remember right, you had not
heard the name of Professor James
Moriarty, who had one of the great
brains ot the century. Just give me
down my index of biographies from
the shell."
He turned over the pages laaily.
leaning back in his chair and blow
ing great clouds from his cigar.
"My collection of Ms Is a rlne one,"
said he. "MorUtrty nimself is enough
to make any letter illustrious, and
here is Morgan the poisoner, and Mer
ridew of abominaoie memory, and
Mathews. who knocked out my left
canine in th:? waiting-room at Charing
Cross, and, .Inaliy. here m our friend
Ol to-night."
He handed over the book, and 1
read: "Moran. Sobaatian, Colonel.
Unemployed. Formerly i3t Bengalore
Pioneers. Born London, ISU&. Son
of Sir Augustus Moran, C.8., once

Westsrn Himalayas' USSIj; Three
Months In the Jungle' (ISS4>. Address:

dian, the Tankerville, the Bagatelle
Card Club."
On the margin was written in
Holmes' precise hand: "The second
most dangerous man in London."
"This is astonishing," said I as I
handed back the volume. "The man's
career is that of an honorable soldier."
"It is true," Holmes answered. Up
to a certain point he did well. He vrtm
always a man of iron nerve and the
story is still told in India how he
crawled down a drain after a wounded
man-eating tiger. There are some
trees, Watson, which grow to a cer
tain height and then suddenly develop
some unsightly eccentricity. You w*Jl
see it often in humans. I have a
theory that the individual represent* in
his development the whole procession
of his ancestors, and that such a sud
den turn to good or evil stands for
some strong influence which came Into
the line of his pedigree. The person
becomes, as it were, the epitome of tnÂ«
history of his own family."
"It is surely rather fanciful."
"Well, I don't insist upon it. What
ever the cause. Colonel Moran began
to go wrong. Without any open scan
dal he still made- India too hot to hold
him. He retired, came to London and
again acquired an evil name. It was
at this time that he was sought out
by Professor Moriarty, to whom for a
time he was chief of the staff. Mo
riarty supplied him liberally with,
money and used him only in one or
two very high-class jobs, which no or
dinary criminal could have undertaken.
You may have some recollection of tbe
death of Mrs. Stewart of Lauder in
1837. Not? Well, I ara sure Moran was
at the bottom of it, but nothing could
be proved. So cleverly was the colonel
concealed that even when the Moriarty
gang was broken up we could not in
criminate him. You remember at tJyit;
date, when I called upon y>u in your
rooms, how I put up the shutters for
fear of air-guns? No doubt you
thought me fanciful. I knew exactly
what I was doing, tor I kneÂ»v of the
existence of this remarkable sun and
I knew also that one of the best ahota
In the world would be behind it. Wjien
we were In Switzerland he followed us
with Moriarty and it was undoubtedly
he who gave me that evil rive min.
utes on the Reichenbach ledge.
"You may think that I read the
papers with some, attention during my
sojourn In France on the lookout flor
any chance of laying him by the heels.
So long as he was free in London my
fife would really not have been worth
living. Night and day the shadow
would have been over me and sooner
or later his chance must have come.
What could I do? I could not shoot
him at sight or I should myself be tn
the dock. There was no use appealing
to a magistrate. They cannot inter-*
fere on the strength of what would
appear to them to be a wild suspicion.
So I could do nothing. But I watched
the criminal news, knowing that soon
er or later I should get him. Then
came the death of this Ronald Adair.
My chance had come at last. Knowing
what I did, was it not certain that
Colonel Moran had done it? He had
played cards with the lad, he had fol
lowed him borne from the club, he had
shot him through the open window.
There was not a doubt of it. The bul
lets alone are enough to put his head
in a noose. I came over at once. I
was seen by the sentinel, who would,
I knew, direct the colonel's attention to
my presence. He could not fail t.
nect my sudden return with his crim*.
and to be terribly alarmed. I was
sure that he would make an attempt
to get me out of the way at ones and
would bring round his murderous
weapon for that purpose. I left him
an excellent mark in the win
dow, and having warned the police
that they might be needed â by the
way, Watson, you spotted their pres
ence in that doorway with unerring ac
curacy â I took up what seemed to pae
to be a Judicious post for observation,
never dreaming that he would choose
the same spot for his attack. Now, my
dear Watson, does anything remain for
me to explain?"
"Yes." said I. "Tou have not made

TSach may form his own hypothesis
on the present evidence, and yours is
as likely to be correct as mine."
"You have formed one. then?"
"I think that it is not difficult to ex
plain the facts. It came out in evi
dence that Colonel Moran and young
Adair had, between them, won a con
siderable amount of money. Now
ran undoubtedly played foul â of that I
have long been aware. I believe that
on the day of the murder Adair had
discovered that Moran waa cheating.
Very likely he had spoken to him pri
vately, and had threatened to expose
him unless he voluntarily resigned his
membership of the club, and promised
not to play cards again. It 13 unlikely
that a youngster like Adair would at
once make a hideous scandal by ex
posing a well-known man so much old
er than himself. Probably he acted as
I suggest. The exclusion from his
clubs would mean ruin to Moran, who
lived by his ill-gotten card-gains. He
therefore murdered Adair, who at the
time was endeavoring to work out
how much money he should nirnself
return, since he could not profit by his
partner's foul play. He locked the
door lest the ladies should surprise him

fj small wing-room, fitted in

X overlooking the ocean. Neither
Miss Belmont nor her aunt was present
and Rollins introduced Olive to the as
sembled guests, with running footnotes
not intended for the ear of the subject.
"Miss Lord," â presenting Clive to a
tall handsome, scornful-looking girl â
"she tears out reputations with her
teeth. Miss Marter â a clever little
snob, who is a joy to flirt with be
cause you know she is too selfish to

most accomplished flirt- Here comes
Mrs. Cartwright, who has the honor of

A middle-aged ladyâ email, stout,
but with much dignity of bearing, her
dark face refined and gentle â entered
and greeted Clive with the rich South
ern brogue which twenty yÂ«ars of
California had not tempered. As he
exchanged platitudes with her, she re
minded him of a gentle breeze which
had wandered aimlessly in, barely
touching his cheek. She talked in
cessantly, and wholly without conse
quence.
Clive had created a perceptible flut
ter among the women. Being a shy
man, he was painfully aware that
â¢every eye in the room was upon him
and that he was being discussed be
hind more than one fan. The other
men â society youths â had entered
and looked crude and new beside him.
He had the straight figure of the ath
lete, and carried his clothes in a man
ner which made Rollins feel, as he
confided to Miss Carter, like hitching
up his trousers. His closely cut hair
was almost black; his mustache, the
color of straw and as uneven as fre
quent conflagrations could make it,
fell over a delicately cut, strong, mo
bile mouth- It had taken many gen
erations to breed his profile â so deli
cate and sensitive was it, yet so
string. His eyes were gray and well
set, full of humor and fire. The chin
and neck were a trifle heavy. There
was something very splendid about
the whole appearance of the man. and
.he filled the eye whenever he stood
in a room.
Mrs. Cartwrighfs fluttering atten
tion having been deflected elsewhere,
he plunged his hands into his pockets
and talked to Mrs. Volney, whose
crepe set off a pair of shoulders of
which he approved. She was a re
markably pretty woman, with large
innocent' looking green eyes and
golden hair, and conversed with a
"babyish inflection which he thought
very fetching. In a moment he for
got her, and went toward the door
â with Rollins. Miss Belmont had en
tered.
The pink color in her face flamed
for a moment, but her eyes lit with
an admiration so unmistakable that
Give, too, colored and laughed ner
vously. He wondered if his eyes were
86 frank as hers. Her tall, slim fig
ure was very round; the delicate neck
carried no superfluous flesh, but was
apparently boneless. The small proud
head was poised well back. Clive
knew her features; but the rich ma
hogany-brown hair, crisp and electric,
.and curling unmanageably, the dark
blue eyes, the warm whiteness of
ekln, the pink of cheek and lips, were
the splendid finish of a hasty sketch.
Her white gown was of some silken
stuff embroidered with silver, and
pearls were in her hair and about
lier throat. She looked as proud and
calm and well conducted as a young
empress.
. "'Of course this is Mr. Clive," she
said. "You are not at all necessary,
Charley. I am so sorry Miss Gordon
â¢is ill. Give me your arm dinner is
ready. I know that you have not told
any . one," she murmured, as they
walked 'down the corridor.
How do you know? It is a good
story and I may have told it all over
the place."
'I am sure you have not even told
ft to Miss Gordon."
; . ' Why Miss Gordon ?" he asked,
'smiling into her frankly curious eyes.
"Are you engaged to her?"
He laughed but made no reply.
"I don't believe you are." she said
abruptly, after they were seated. "You
don't look the least bit as if any one
owned you." .

"Im tired to

turn them all out presently. I bought
this place to be near the redwoods,
which I love better than anything in
the world, and I like to entertain by
fits and starts. I spent last winter
here alone."
"I should like to have known you
then. When you- get time to think
about yourself you must be a charm
ing egoist."
"You have the most impertinent
tongue and the most flirtatious eyes
I have ever met."
"Where is the man you are engaged
to?"
"Up at Shasta and the lava beds.
He will be back in a few days. You
will like him."
"Is he a good fellow?"
"Yes," with friendly enthusiasm;
"an awfully good fellow."
"You don't love him, though."
Her lashes half met â a habit they
had. "No," she said, "I don't believe
I do."
"Helena! Helena!" cried Rollins.
â¢'Clive, I feel it my duty to tell you
that she is..en*aged, and for the fif

â¢â¢He has been telling me that I am
not in love Mr. Van Rhuys, and
intimating tnat he has come just in
time to save me from a fatal mis
take."
She looked charmingly impertm.'rt,
her eyes half closed, her chin lifted,
her pink lips pouting from their classic
lines.
Clive was somewhat taken abac*,
but replied promptly, "If I disclaim Â»t
is from timidity, not lack of gallantry:
I fear I should learn more than I have
the power to teach."
Everybody laughed. Miss Belmont's
eyes sparkled. "You mean," she said,
when the attention of the others was
once more diverted, 'that you are not
going to fall in love with me. Every
body does, you know. I never mind
surrounding myself with beautiful
women, because I am much more fas
cinating than an- of them."
"I am hopelessly unoriginal but I
shall make a desperate effort this
time."
"Why do you say that? You look
quite unlike any one I have ever seen;
I mean quite a different person looks
out of your eyes." Her own eyes had
a frankly speculative regard devoid of
coquetry, Clive's masculine vanity
warmed.
"You read a great deal I hear," he
said.
â¢What an extraordinary way you
have of ignoring what a person says
to you. Are you absent-minded, or
deaf, or merely impolite?"
"Merely an Englishman."
Miss Belmont's color deepened.
CJive's eyes invoked a ridiculous pic
ture of a stately young chatelaine
kicking and struggling in an English
man's arms.
â Why do the people of your country
take pride in being rude?"
"They don't. They don't bother
about trifles like the men of several
other nations, that is all. I'll open
the door for you when you leave the
room and even take off my hat in the
lift and catch a cold in my head, but
don't expect me to find a reply to all
the nonsense a woman chooses to talk,
it a more interesting subject occurs to
me."
"Are you very haughty and super
cilious, or are you very shy?"
"What does that mean?"
'I mean that you were flattered to
death by what I said, and changed the
subject, as a girl would blush or
stammer."
"I suspect you are right." He rose
to let her pass. His eyes laughed
down into hers, and she felt the sud
den content of a child when it is no
ticed by a person of superior years
and stature.
"That man has the most charming
eyes I ever saw," she said, as the
dining-room door closed behind the
women. "I don't believe they ever
could be sober."
"Just observe his lower jaw," said
Mrs. Volney, with her infantile lisp.
CHAPTER VI.
When the men left the dining-room
they found the women in the patio,
or scattered about the corridor. There
was no moon, but the clear sky blazed
with stars and colored lanterns swung
between the pillars or among the
broad leaves of the palm-trees. The
girls (the married women were little
more) had thrown lace or silken
scarfs over their heads and fluttered
their fans idly. Clive recalled all he
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
had read of the old time and imagined
himself back among the careless dons
and donas who lived for little but
pleasure, and had not a prescience of
the complex civilization to enter their
Arcadia and rout its very memory.
Miss Belmont was sitting in the
corridor, leaning over the low balus
trade, her hands lightly clasped. She
had draped a white lace mantilla
about her head, and looked more
Spanish than Miss West. It seemed
to Clive that she had a faculty of
looking whatever she wished. Some
one handed her a guitar. She leaned
against the pillar and tuned it ab
sently. Clive walked over and stood
staring down on her, his hands In his
pockets. She sang in a rich contralto
voice a Spanish song, whose words he
could not understand, but which was
the most passionate he had ever
hear*. Her head was thrown back.
She sang frankly to Clive; her face
changed with every line.
When it was over Mrs. Cartwright
breathed a plaintive sigh. "That's the
handsomest song that Helena sings,"
she announced.
Helena arose abruptly. "Come,"
she said to Clive. "Let us go for a
walk."
He followed her out into the rose
garden. There were no lanterns here,
and it looked wilder than by day.
The air was very warm and sweet.
Helena plucked one of the pink Cas
tilian roses and fastened back her
mantilla with it, exposing a charming
ear.
"You will never find any occupation
so becoming to your hands," said Clive
dutifully. "Are your feet as perfect?"
They went out on the terrace. The
said Miss Belmont flippantly.
They went out on the terrace. The
ocean pounded monotonously, tossing
spray high into the air. Clive looked
at his companion. Her head was
thrown back, her lips slightly apart.
She looked like a woman who held a
ball of fire between her finger-tips and
toyed with It caressingly.
"Shall we walk along the cliffs?"
She hesitated a moment. "No; let us
go into the forest."
As they entered they were greeted
by a rush of cool, perfumed air, the
scent of wild lilac and lily, the strong.
bracing odor of redwood and pine. For
a hundred yards or more there was lit
tle brush; the great trees stood far
apart; but as they left the plateau and
ascended a narrow trail, the young
redwoods and ferns and lilacs grew
thick. It was a hard pull and they
said little. He helped her up the al
most perpendicular ascent, over fallen
trees and rocks and huge roots spring
ing across the path like pythons, and
wondered if they wefe penetrating
wilds hitherto sacred to the red man.
Presently the low roar of water greet
ed them, and pushing their way
through a small grove of ferns they
came upon the high bank of a broad
creek. Beyond and around rose the
dark, rigid forest, but into the opening
the stars flung plentiful light. They
GERTRUDE ATHERTON
revealed the clear rapid rush of water
over huge stones and logs that looked
like living things, great bunches of
maidenhair springing from dripping
boulders, the dark, mysterious per
spective of the creek.
Clive did not wonder If he would lose
his head. He had no Intention of keep
ing it.
"Sit down." she said, arranging her
self on a fallen pine and leaning
against a redwood. Clive made him
self as comfortable as he could and she
gave him permission to light his pipe.
The lace mantilla. In spite of brush
and briar, still clung to her shoulders.
She looked very lovely and womanly.
"Why did you bring me here?" he
asked. "You told me the other night
that you would never trust yourself
alone with me. This Is equivalent to
saying that you want me to make love
to you. I am quite ready."
"How brutally abrupt you are. I
don't want you to make love to me. I
meant to tell you before we started
that I did not expect it. Most women
do. I know, and It must be such a re
lief to a man to be let off occasionally."
She opened and closed her large fan,
with a graceful motion of the wrist.
and then turned and looked straight at
him.
"I have never walked alone with a
man In this forest before." she said;
"neither at night nor In the daytime.
It would have been spoiled for me if I
had."
He pulled at his pipe. "Tou are a
very brave woman. If what you say
Is true, what Is your reason for bring
ing me here?"
"I felt a desire to do so, and I always
obey my whims."
"You know that my vanity Is touched
to the quick. But will you tell me
why you are doing all you can to turn
my head if you don't want me to
make love to you?"
"I do want you to."
Clive laid down his pipe.
"No! It would be a pity to let It go
out, and it might set my forest on fire.
Do let me finish. Women are not like
men. A man is fascinated by a wo
man, and his one impulse is to get
her, and without loss of time; a woman
may have the same impulse, but the
dislike of being won too quickly, the
desire to be sure of herself, above all.
the wish to make the man more serious
â all these things hold her back. So I
don't want you to make love to me to
night."
"Which means that I may later?"
"I don't know. That will depend on
a good many things, one of which is
whether I break my engagement with
Schuyler Van Rhuys or not. I have
some slight sense of honor."
Clive colored hotly, and for the mo
ment his ardor left him.
"Are you thinking of breaking it
off?" f
"Somewhat."
"Is it true that you have been en
gaged fifteen times?" _,
"No; only eight. I have not yet dis
covered that there are fifteen interest
ing men in the world. I have only met
nine."
"You can flatter charmingly. But
you say you have a sense of honor.
What would you think of a man who
deceived and Jilted eight girls?"
"It is quite different with a man;
women are so helpless. But when a
woman has the reputation of being
fickle, men know what to expect and
propose with their eyes open. A3 a
matter of fact, there is not an atom of
the flirt, in me; of coquetry, perhaps,
for I have an irrepressible desire to
please the man who has pleased me.
To most men I am clay. I am doing
all I can to fascinate you, and I shall
continue to do so. I engaged myself to
each of those eight men, honestly be
lieving that I could love himâ that I
had found a companion. If I ever suf
fered the delusion that any one of
them was my grande passion the delu
sion was brief. Still, I gave up all idea
of that some years ago. With each of
those men I set myself honestly to get
into sympathy, and to love him. Of
course you will understand that I had
been more or less fascinated in each
case. If a man has not magnetism for
me, he might have every other quality
given to mortal and he would not at
tract my passing attention. Well, I
could not find anything la any one of
them to get hold of. One cannot love
a clever mind, nor personal magnet
ism, nor a charming trick of manner,
nor a kind heart; nor aIL There Is
something else. One hates to be senti
mental, but I suppose what those men
nave lacked Is soul. Our men don't
seem to have time for that. It Isn't In
the make-up of this country. Perhaps
I haven't it; but, at all events, I have
a mental conception of it, and know
that it is what I want."
Clive puffed at his pipe for a mo
ment.
"Are you talking pretty nonsense,"
he asked, "or do you mean that?"
She turned her head away angrily.
"You are Just like other men," she
said. "I have always been laughed or
stared at by every man I have ever had
the courage to broach the subject to. I
was a fool to speak to you. It is two
or three years since I let myself go
like this."
"I am not laughing. It Is a very se
rious subject; the most serious in life.
Girls and men and minor poets are al
ways prating of it, but it is a good
subject to keep quiet about until you
understand it."
"Don't you think I understand about
it?"
"I think you will some time â yes,
certainly. And you had better not
marry Mr. Van Rhuys."
"W| are m new," she said, leaning
her elbows on her knees, her chin on
her clasped hands. "It is as if the Al
mighty had flun; a lot of brilliant par
ticles together, which cohered symmet
rically, and so quickly that the spirit
ual essence of the universe had no time
to crawl inside. I stayed here last
winter by myself trying to solve the
problem of life, but I only addled my
brain. I read and read and read, and
thought and thought and thought, and
In the end I felt sadder, but not
wiser."'
"You can't find it alone." * â¢
She flushed and he saw her eyes
deepen.
"Then Schuyler Van Rhuys turned
up, and I concluded that the best thing
I could do was to go to New York and
cut a dash in the smart set. And he is
such a good fellow. He would tight su
perbly if there were a war; he would
carry me safely out of a mob; he
would always be kind, and in a manner
companionable for he is well up on af
fairs and current art and literature. I
should like you to know hi'n. for he Is
one of the best types of American you
will ever meet. Butâ there is nothing
else. And I am the stronger of the
two. There's nothing as solitary a*
that."
"Don't marry him. You have no ex
cuse â at your age and with your brain.
"Wait until you rind the right man,
even if it is a million years hence."
"Oh, I've heard that " She paused
abruptly. "It isn't like you to talk
exaggerated nonsense. What did you
mean by that last?"
"What I said."
Her lip curled. "You don't mean to>
say that you believe in a life after
this â you."
'Why not?"
"Well, do explain."
"I don't see why any belief of mine
should interest you."
"But it does. Tell me:"
"This is not my hour for lecturing.
I'd much rather talk about you."
"Oh, please don't be unhumanly
modest. Go on, you've roused my cu
riosity now, and I will know what you.
think."
"Wry well. Not being an unreason-
Ing oyster. I believe in a future state.
Not in the old-fashioned business, of
course; but if a man has ever thought,
and if he has had two or three genera
tions of thinking ancestors behind,
him he hardly believes that the scheme
of creation is so purposeless as to turn
people of progressive development
loose on one unsatisfactory plane,
only." Clive spoke rapidly when he
spoke at length, but paused abruptly
every now and again, then resumed
without impulsion. "What would be
the object? What the meaning? Ever 1 . -
thing else in the scheme of creation
has a meaning, leads to something de
finite. â¢ â¢ â¢ That 19 the signifi
cance of the lack of soul you search
for in a race of men that have not yet
had time to develop it â who are yet
surely progressing toward such a con
summation. â¢ â¢ â¢ On this earth
it takes generations of leisure, of art,
of literature, of science, but mainly of
individual thinking, to develop the sub
tle combination which puts man in re
lation with the divine principle In tho
universe. The pre-eminent develop
ment of England over all the other na
tions is as Indisputable as it is nat
ural. What would be the object of
such mental and spiritual development
if this incomplete life of ours were all?
We go on afterward, of course; as
cending by slow and laborious evolu
tion, from plane to plane."
"And about the other thins? Tou
believe that In one existence or an
other you meet the person who satis
fies you In all thingsâ your other
part?"
"Perliaps two In a century meet In
this existence. But most of us don't â â 
in centuries. Perhaps millions of cen

may not be born here for several cen

time. And when you do, you and he

that I believe passes all understanding

or two fortunate ones of each century
or so. â¢ â¢ â¢ The ancients had
some such idea when they toolc Bra
out of Adam."
Helena rose and went to the edge of
the creek. She stood there without
speaking for ten minutes, kicking the
stones down Into the water. Then she
turned about.
"I have always looked upon that sort
of thing as poetical rot." she said; "be
neath the consideration of any one of
the higher order of Intelligence; proba
ably because In this country, particu
larly in this State, everything occult,
except religion, and sometimes that, is
enveloped fifteen times over In vulgar
and mercenary fraud. Even well writ

tolerance of anything which cannot be
demonstrated, I suppose. But If a man
like you believes it makes one think."
She came and sat close beside him 00
the log. her gown brushing his feet. '
"It Is true " she began.
"This is hardly fair, you know," said]
Clive.
"What?" *
"You know as well as I do. If I am
not to make love to you â and In a way
you have placed me on my honor â go
and sit at the other end of the lor."
"Pshaw." After what you have Just
said you should be above such things.'*
"I am not a spirit yet, please- remem
ber. And I am not by any means so
highly developed
as I ought to be.
If you don't go
away I shall take
hold of you."
Helen went back
to her former po
sition.

about'that thing. I thought, as I stood
dv the creek, of our literature. Has it
occurred to you that no American au
thor has ever written a genuine all
round love scene? They are either
thin or sensual, almost invariably the
former. The soul and passion of the
older races they have never developed.
If a woman writer breaks out wildly
sometimes, she merely voices the lack
we all feel in this section of the world
âin life as well as in literature. That
explains why I have tried to care for
-.eight clever and interesting men and
turned away chilled." . t>
â¢â¢You must love an Englishman,
so-td Clive. smiling. "If you notice, a
good many American women do. An
Englishwoman never . marries an
American. It goes to prove what I
said. a littte while ago; leisure is need
ed, for development; consequently the
women of America have developed far
more rapidly than the men."
"Don't imagine for a moment that I
am disparaging my own country." said
Helena hurriedly; "I am % the best
American in the world â I wouldn't be
anything else; and 1 like and admire
our men for their cleverness. and pluck
and : wonderful go -ahead ness. But I
will confide to you something that I
have never told a living soulâ l have
such a contempt for the Anglomanias
that 1 have a horror of being taken for
one. It is this: something English in
me has survived through five genera
tions: I was brought up in a library
of English literature; perhaps that fos
tered it. As long as I merely read and
studied. I lived in imagination among
English scenes and people people
of your history and those created by
your authors and poets. Something in
me responded to every line that I read;
I felt at home; singularly enough
much more so than when I finally vis
ited England. Until a few years ago
I could not force myself to read Ameri
can literatureâ with the sole exception
of Bret Harte, It Is so cold, so slight,
so rorbidding. It is the piano of let
ters. Now, of course, I appreciate the
mentality in it and the delicate art, the
light rapid sketches of passing phases.
And' it seems to me that before we
produce a Shakespeare or Byron we
shall have to relapse into barbarism,
and emerge and develop by slow and
sure stages to the condition of Eng
land when she produced her great men.
We have gone ahead too fast to ever
become great from our present begin
nings; we are all brilliant shallows and
no depths. "
"You disprove a great deal that yau
say."
-, Helena bent forward, pressing her
chin hard into the palm of her hand.
She had forgotten that she was a beau
tiful woman, but even so she was
graceful.
â  If we Cal'fornians have a stronger
fiber and richer biood in us than other
Americans," she replied, "it is because
â re are cruder, savager, close to nature.
I do things that no Eastern girl in the

Â£O .straight for it, undeterred by any

more to give."
Â£he paesed and Clive filled and lit
another pipeful of tobacco.
"You take great satisfaction out of
that pipe," she said pettishly. ; .i.
' "It Is my only safeguard."
SiÂ»e laughed and he could see her
flush.
"I suppose that English something
in . me which has survived was what
sprang so instantly to yourecogni
tion."
"You have been in England, and you
Jijve met many Englishmen."
"I have lik-ed some of them tremen

â  -'"So, no," she said plaintively. "How
could I? I am not what you imagine

you."

gray, drifting no more toward person
alities. Then Clive looked at his watch.
â¢"Do you know what time it is?"
."I do not in the least care."
"It is three o'clock. And I can see
tfcat you are tired. Come!"
She rose and he jerked her shawl
across: her chest and threw one end
bver her shoulder. "What a silly child
you are to come out with that bare
neck." Aren't you chilled?"
\tfhe smiled in at him as gratefully
as if unused to the tender care of man.
They went down the mountain with
oiit conversation; it was very dark and
eteep; a misstep might have sent one
or both headlong.
"The house was without lights; even
the lanterns in the corridors had burn
ed put. As they entered the court a
man rose from a long chair, yawning
and siretching himself. It was Charley
Rollins.
â¢ â¢;My God. Helena:" he exclaimed,
"this is going too far. You know that
all of us who know you swear by you,
but you can't do this sort of thing
with such women as Mrs. Volney and
Harriet Lord in the house. Sitting up
all night under a tree in full view of
all Del Monte is one thing, but the
middle 'o-f a forest, where you have
never taken a man in the daytime be
foreâfor heaven's sake, my dear child,
have a care."
He ended rather feebly, for Helena
had brought down her foot and thrown
pack- her head with flashing eyes. "I
%hall do exactly what I choose to do,"
eh* cried. "And I hope Amy Volney
and Harriet Lord have their heads out
ef their doors this minute. What busi
oees is it of yours, I should like to
know? How dare you take me to task?
Take Mr* Clive over to the dining
room and give him some brandy, then
90 home: or stay all night if you
tÂ«hodse; there are two empty rooms at
the corner. Good-night, Mr. Clive."
And without taking further notice of
Hollins she crossed over to the oppo
site corridor and disappeared.
CHAPTER VII.
Clive and Rollins exchanged few
words on the drive home. Miss Bel
rrront name was not mentioned.
Clive'-s feelings were mixed. He can
didly admitted that his vanity was
"profoundly at peace with itself,, and
that Helena Belmont was the most in
teresting woman he had ever met.
Nevertheless, his , conscience chattered
at his vanity like an angry monkey at
a .peacock,
'I feel exactly like a delinquent hus
band," he thought. "Premonitory, I
suppose. I have an absurdly married
feeling; the result of a long engage
ment, probably, and a lifelong â¢ ac
quaintance. â¢Â».. â¢ *I wonder if a
man ever bothers if the woman is not
likely to find him out; I can't say it
has ever worried me much before. I
suppose It's on the principle that what
a' woman doesn't know won't hurt
.her."
Then he wondered if he would have
eat up all night with another woman
had he been engaged to Helena Bel
mont.
â¢ lie made his confession three days
later, when Mary was rully recovered.
She smiled a little sadly, the smile
which seems to belong to the lips of
euch women, fashioned to be good
wives and mothers, and nothing more.
She put up her hand and touched his
hair shyly; she seldom caressed him.
"She , is . always . sitting -up all night
with some one or other. It seems to be
a lad xit hers. ' And you know I trust
you absolutely."* (He had the grace
to blush.) "But, I think, if you don't
mind, that I'll announce the engage
ment."
"Why, of course, I don't mind," he
said, taken aback. "It was your Idea
to keep It quiet, not mine."
"Yes; but I think I'd like her to
know."
As Clive left the cottage he met Rol
lins.
"I have something to tell you, old
chap," he said awkwardly. "I want
you to congratulate me. I am engaged
to Miss Gordon."
"The devil you are!" exclaimed Rol
lins, slapping him on the back, "I do
congratulate you, old fellow; she's a
Jewel of a girl. Going to marry here?"
"Yes, in San Francisco."
"The club will give you a send-off
the night before. You won't look as
handsome on your wedding morn as
you otherwise might, and you'll have
a dark brown taste in your mouth, but
in a long period of domestic bliss you'll
have a great joy to look back upon."
They walked down to the camp to
gether, tsen Rollins left abruptly, and,
returning to Yorba went to the tele
pkone office.
CHAPTER VIII.
Helena Belmont saw little of her
company for two days. She spent part
of the time in the forest, the rest In
her boudoir, a long room at the east
6ide of the house opening Into her bad
ioom at one end and into a small li
brary at the other. The bedroom was
a pretty thing of pale pink and green,
and white lace. The library, lined from
floor to ceiling with books, many sev
eral generations old, had only a rug on
the bare floor, a table and several up
right chairs. The wails of the boudoir
were paneled with the beautiful deli
cately veined redwood the forest trees
conceal under their forbidding bark.
The ceiling was arched and heavily
beamed. The curtains of doors and
windows, the deep chairs and couches,
the rugs on the dark floor were of
Smyrna stuffs whose only tangible
color was a red that was almost black.
A redwood mantel was built to the
ceiling; a large table of the same wood,
heavily carved, was covered with books
and costly trifles. The deep window
seats were also upholstered. The Cas
tilian roses nodded against the pane,
but Helena could look aoove the gar
den wall into the forest on the moun
tain.
And here Helena sat for hours. She
was profoundly stirred and touching
lightly the keys of something akin to
happiness. Several times before in her
life she had felt what she believed to
be the quickening of love, but it had
died In its swaddling clothes and had
been a vagary of the fancy to this. Her
brain and her woman's instinct told
her unerringly that she had found the
man. Every part of her went out to
him. A faint sweet something tipped
her pulses. It Is possible that passion
was regnant at this time; that she was
possessed by the savage primitive de
sire of the first woman for the first
man; so far she had come in contact
with little beyond the man's powerful
personality and responsive magnetism.
Nevertheless there had been spiritual
recognition, blind and groping as it
may have been; certain torpid instincts
stirred, and she divined vaguely what
a woman might be to her husband.
She had known many married women
more or less intimately, been the con
fidant of more than one liaison; and
with intuition fostered by such knowl
edge and her own strong brain, she re
joiced that she had met him in time,
divining something of the bitter sad
ness which companions a woman v,ho,
meeting a man too late, must be one
thing to him, instead of twenty; his
wife would still have the better part
of his life, his higher nature, his duty,
the supreme happiness of making his
home.
She dreamed dreams of her future
with Clive; the love and the art by
which she would hold him. the com
panionship. She forgot Mary Gordon's
existence. Had she remembered; she
would have imperidusly dismissed the
very thought of her. She had obtained
what she wanted all her life and rec
ognized no obstacles.
She went up to the log by the creek
and touched caressingly the tree
against which he had leaned, gathered
some of the ashes from his pipe and
held them in the hollow of her hand.
She smiled as she did so and wondered
that clever women and silly women
should be so little dissimilar when in
love.
It was on the morning of the third
day that the Chinese butler tapped at
her door and said â
"Mr. Liollins wantee you at tele
phone, missee."
"Oh, tell somebody else to answer
him. I am tired of the very sound of
that telephone. Some one is at it all
day. I've a great mind to have it
taken out."
"Allight, mlssee."
A few moments later he returned.
"Mr. Lollins slay he got something
velly important tellee missee."
Helena went rapidly to the little
room by the front door sacred to the
telephone. The fear shook her that
something had happened to Clive.

i you haven't forgotten that you are all
f to dine with ua."
: "I had forgotten it, but we'll be
, there."
i "Great Scott, Helena! have you also
forgotten that this is our last nigh^
t and that you asked six of us to spend
a week with you? Are those boys still
there?"
i "They are; but I'll send them home
i this minute. I'm awfully sorry I for

1 you. I'll send a wagon over for your
â¢ traps this afternoon, and the char-a
banc Will bring you back to-night.
: Now, clear out, I have a great deal to
( attend to."
1 Helena replaced the trumpet care
1 fully In its bracket, fhen leaned her
elbows on the, table and laughed. The
1 one sensation of which she was defl
i nitftly conscious for the moment was
i genuine amusement. She recalled her
dreams, her picture life with Clive, and
felt a fool; but she had always been
: able to laugh at herself, and she did
â so now. in a little while she went into
the corridors where the guests were
dawdling after their morning drive.
"Mes enfants," she said* blowing a
. kiss from the tips of her fingers, to each
j of the young men in turn, "go straight-
way and pack up. You are to go home
on the 4:10. I asked, a weÂ»;k ago, six of
the club men to vacate. And what do
you think? My Englishman is engaged
to Mary Gordon."
She ruffled her hair with a tragic lit
tle gesture, threw up her hands and
disappeared.
It was not long before the humor
died out of her. In its wake came the
profoundest depression she had ever
known. She looked into a blank and
colorless future, realizing that a wo
man may be young till fifty if it is still
her privilege to seek and wait and
hope, but that when her great joy has
touched and passed her she has buried
all. that is best of her youth.
She could not stay in her rooms, elo
quent of imaginings, but went back to
"her puests and â¢clung to them and talk
ed of what interested them, and had
never been more hospitable and charm
ing: all the "while counting the years
and months and days that lay ahead
of her. The depression lasted for
hours, during which she wondered If
the weight in her brain was crushing
the lUht and reason out of It.
And then the devil entered Into her.
CHAPTER IX.
The girls in their gayest muslin
frocks, chaperoned by the more sedate
Mrs. Cartwright, arrived at the camp
at seven. A long table was, spread un
der the redwoods hear the bank of the
little river, in whose falls bottles lay
cooling. Clive was the only other
guest. Mary Gordon had been asked,
but although she had accepted with
philosophy much that was Californlan,
the informalities of the Bohemian Club
were more than she could stand. Clive
had been begged to go alone and to
stay as late as he liked.
Helena wore a pink muslin frock,
her hair in a loose braid. Her eyes
were dancing. She looked like a
naughty child and chattered clever
nonsense, apparently in the highest of
spirits.
An impromptu band played softly
out of sight: one could hear the splash
ing of the river and the faint music of
the redwoods. Chinese lanterns, sus
pended in a row over the table and
from the young redwoods, gave abun
dant light. It was a very Informal
dinner. The men wore flannel
shirts, smoked when it pleased them,
and assumed any attitude conducive to
comfort. Clive tipped his chair back
against a tree and felt that It was his
duty to rejoice that Mary was not
present. Every man waited on himself
and on the guests of honor. Helena,
at the head of the table, had the one
servant constantly at her elbow. It
was her tendency to spoil the men she
liked, and she encouraged the Bohe
mians in all their transgressions;
which was one of the many reasons
why they liked her better than any
other woman in California.
A course not pleasing her taste, she
called for her guitar and sang for them
a rollicking song of the bull-fight.
Clive leaned forward on the table and
watched her; her nostrils expanded as
Jf they had the scent of blood in them;
she curled her lips under, clicking her
teeth. Her eyes had not wandered to
Clive since, upon entering the camp,
she had prettily congratulated him.
"Helena, you alarm me," said Rollins
mildly, when she had finished. "I
haven't seen you look as wicked as you
do to-night for several years. You
would give a stranger, Mr. Clive for
instance, the impression tnat you were
a cruel little demon, as you sing that
song. Of course we know that only
heaven in its infinite mercy lends you
to us for a little."
"Oh, Mr. Clive!" said Helena in a
weary tone, but with a suspicious
alertness of eye; "I had such a funny
experience with Mr. Clive the other
night. I think I'll have to tell it."
She threw back her head and laughed
infectiously: "Oh, it was so funny!"
Clive experienced an uncomfortable
thrill. The others gave her immediate
attention.
"Don't hesitate to tell us. Helena,"
said Rollins. "We will keep your con
fidence. And have mercy on our curi
osity; that adjective is so vague."
Helena leaned forward, and clasping
her hand about her chin, looked at her
company with dancing eyes.
"Probably you all know," she Bald,
"that not long since I spent five hours
in the forest alone with Mr. Clive,
talking In the midnight hour. Well,
you don't know that Mr. Clive had
previously told me that if he ever sat
up all night with me he should kiss
me. and several times; so when I took
him to the loneliest spot I knew, the
Intimation was that I expected him to
do justice to his principles, wasn't it?"
"It was, Helena," said Rollins, with
an attempt at facetlousness. "and I
hope he did. Served you right."
"Well, he did not! And I sat not
three feet away from him for five
hours, and never looked better. How
do you suppose I bluffed him off?"
"Oh, come, Helena!" said RWlins,
who was beginning to feel sorry for
Clive.
"You know," she continued, tossing
her hÂ«ad and tapping her foot, much
like a spirited racehorse, "I have al
ways said I could do exactly as I
pleased with a man, and I can. So it
pleased me to play chess with an Eng
lishman, whose only idea of the game
is to Jump over the board. Well, first
I mildly remonstrated with him; then
we argued the matter quite coolly, for
he smoked his pipe, and Englishmen
are unusually cool, you know. My
powers of persuasion were not very ef-
Then I told him that I was
â ifimi But as he was, tot.', he could
not see the force of my remark. Well,
you'd never guess in the wide world
what I did them. I gently led him off
on to the subject of religion, and he
preached until three o'clock, and forgot
all about wanting to kiss me. No*-, I
call that sort of a man a duffer!" (with
an affected drawl.) "What do you
think about it?"
There was an intense and uncomfort
able silence. Then Clive pushed back
his chair abruptly. He walked straight
up to Helena, lifted her from her seat,
pinioned her arms and kissed her while
one could count thirty.
The men sprang to their feet. Their
sympathies were with Clive, but she
was their guest, and a woman; they
would do whatever she commanded.
Clive dropped her into her chair, not
too gently.
"Sit down, gentlemen," she said, se
renely; "we -will now go on with the
dinner."
CHAPTER X.
Mr. Van Rhuys returned the next
morning. Helena and several of her
guests drove over tc/ the hotel station
to meet him. The train was not due
for some moments after their arrival.
Helena sprang from the char-a-banc
and ran up the hill to the Gordon cot
tage. Clive and -Alary came out to
meet her.
"I didn't want to write you a formal
note of congratulation. Miss Gordon. "
she said, smiling charmingly. "I hoped
to see you last night at the dinner. I
am so sorry you were not there. It
was a most interesting dinner."
"So Mr. Clive told me," said Mary
innocently. "You are very kind, dear
Miss Belmont."
"I want to give you a dinner. To
morrow? I must be quick. I hear my
train. Do say yes."
"I am so sorry, thank you so much,
but papa and I are going to San Fran
cisco to-morrow afternoon. He ha 3
business, and my dressmaker wants
me. After that we are going to pay
three visits in San Mateo and MenU*
Park; we had hoped to get out of
them, but it seems we can't, and papa
thinks I'd better go."
"Oh!" said Helena. "What are yon
going to do with Mr. Clive?"
"That Is the question. Of course he
will be asked, too, as soon as they
know, but he hates the thought* of it.
He says he will stay in San Francisco
and run down and see me occasionally,
but I hate to have him mere at this
time of the year, with those winds and
fogs. I want him to stay here and be
comfortable. It is such a rest for him
after that long trip."
"Miss Gordon, you are beginning
badly. You will spoil him. I should
like to marry an Englishman just for
the pleasure of bringing him up in the
way he should go. Suppose you leave
him in my charge. I will take good
care of him, and see that he does noth
ing but loaf." She turned to Clive,
who was starinar at her. his hands in
his pockets, his lips together.
"Cc-me over and stay at Casa Norte.
You know all the men and they will
love to have you."
"Oh, do, Owln," said Mary. "They
are always so jolly there, and I shall
feel much easier about you."
"Very well," said Clive, "I will go.
Thank you."
"I'll send over for you In tiin* for
dinner. Will that be right? Oh, my
train! my train! What will Mr. Van
Rhuys think of me? Good-by. Miss
Gordon. Hasta luego. Mr. Clive.'
She ran down the hill as a man cam*
forward to met her. He was a big.
well-made man with the walk and car
riage the perfect adjustment of clothes
which distinguish the fashionable New
Yorker. His Dutch ancestry showed
vaguely In his face, which was fair
and large, and roughly modeled; but
the clever, pleasant eyes were Ameri
can- the deep lines about them be
trayed an experience of life which re
claimed the face from any tendency to
the commonplace. HÂ« looked the
rather blase man of forty, yet full of
vitality and good nature and possessed
of all the brains he would ever need.
His eyes deepened as he took Hen
ena's hand.
"How jolly well you look," he said,
with the slight affectation of accent
peculiar to the smart New Yorker.
-I'm awfully glad to see you again,
awfully."
As the char-a-banc drove off, th*
girls leaned out and waved their hands
to Miss Gordon and Cirve, and Vaa
Rhuys was told of the engagement.
"Good looking chap," he said.
"Isn't he?" said Helena enthusiasti
cally. "I sat out all night with him.
Just for the pleasure of looking at him.
Van Rhuys frowned and turned
away. He had wished more than once
that Helena Belmont, doubly fascinat
ing as her unconventionality made her,
had been brought up in New York. He
had had more than one spasm of pre
monitory horror, but had reminded
himself that none knew better than
she bow to b* grand* dam* If sh*
chose.
When they reached th* houa* h*
went to his room to clean up, then
sought Helena in her boudoir. Sh* was
leaning over the back ot a chair, tip
ping It nervously.
"I want to say something right
away," ah* said, as he do*ed th* door.
"I want you to release me â I casetot
marry you."
Van Rhuys pressed his Up* together
and half closed his eyes. But he mere
ly asked, "What is the reason 7"
"I am going to marry Mr. Cliv*.'* :
Ton are going to do what?" Van
Rhuys' eyes opened very wide. He Un
derstood Helena very little, and owl* of
her enduring charms was her quality
of the unexpected. "Are you speaking
of the man who is engaged to Miss
Gordon?"
"Yes, that is the man. I am not jok
ing."
"You mean that you are going to- try
to cut that poor girl out?"
"I mean that I shall," said Helena
passionately. "He is the only man
that I have ever really wanted, and I
Intend to hay* him."
"It's a dâ d dishonorable thing to
do."
"I don't care. Honor' 3 nothing but
an arbitrary thing., anyhow. I'll iavÂ»
what I want. It wasn't necessary for
me to tell you this, but tt does m*
good to say it to somebody."
"And you don't care whether I am
hurt or not â nor that poor girl?".
"Oh, I don't believe I do. X wish I
did. I feel so wickedâ bat I can't. I
can't care for anything else. You* didn't
love me very much, anyhow. You are
merely in love with me."
"You never gave me the chance. I
have barely kissed you. I had hoped
that after a while, after we were jtiar
ried, it might be different. You ouv*
fully made up your mind?"
"All the mind I've got is in it."
"Then I don't see that there's any
thing for me to do but go. I cant
hang around here. I'll have a sudden
telegram calling me to New York. Will
you shake hands?"
She came forward and gave him her
hand. "Have I been unfair?'* she
asked, smiling. "I didn't have time to
write, and at least I didn't break it off
by telephone, as I did with one of
them."
"You have behaved with the utmost
consideration," said Van Rhuys dr^py
He looked at her a moment. "Supjpse
you fail?" he asked.
"Fail?" she said haughttly. "I -
fail. There's nothing I'll stop at â
nothing! nothing! I always get what
I want I was horn that way."
"I know; but there is a pretty toÂ»gh
sort of fiber in some Englishmen; and
they call it honor. Well, good lock to
you and good-by; I shall go on the
4:10."
CHAPTER XI.
Clive drove over the next afternoon.
He sat some distance from Helena at
dinner, and afterward she and Mrs.
Lent played billiards with himself and
one of the other men for an hour; the
rest of the evening was passed m the
large living-room. wherÂ» Clive listened
to better amateur music than haâÂ»ari
ever heard before. Some tittle time
after the women had retired a Chinese
servant entered the dining-room,
where the men were drinking brandy
and-soda, and said to dive â
"Mlssee Hellee wantee see you in
bludc-ir."
"What?" asked Clive, srupiaiy.
"Her gracious majesty is pleased to
signify that she will give you audience
in her boudoir," said Rollins, who
stood beside him.
"But I can't go to her room at this
hour. It is one o'clock."
"That is her affair. Besides, no- on*
else need know. Follow the Mongo
lian. If you don't it's like her to come
here and order you to go."
The Chinaman left Clive at the door
of the boudoir. The room was empty
and dimly lit. The air was heavy with
the scent of the roses beyond the win
dow. Clive looked up into the forest.
The aisles were too black for shadows,
although the huge trunks were defined.
The mysterious arbors above sang
gently.
Helena came out of her bedroom
presently, closing the door behind her.
Clive went to meet her. 'Am I to
apologize?" he asked. "I shan't mean
It if I do. What you did was abom
inable."
"Don't scold me. I never thought I'd
do such a thing. I don't know what
possessed me."
"The devil, I should say. But I hope
I'll never see you in that mood again.
You were at your unloveliest.^^K
came near to being vulgar.'
"I was quite vulgar and you know It.
Don't let ua say any more about it. Sit
down here in the window."
The window-seat was bffead and
deep and heavily cushioned. They
made themselves very comfortable.
"You can light your pipe. I am glad
you came â very glad."
"I ought not to be here at all. I was
an ungrateful wretch In the first place
not to go where I ought to be now, and
a weaker one to come here."
Helena leaned her elbow on the low
grating and looked up at him. There
was neither childishness nor coquetry
in her eyes.
"But I am glad." She paused a mo
ment. "I have sent away Mr. Van
Rhuys."
"Mr. Van Rhuys has had a happy
escapeâ and I am not necessarily un
complimentary to you."
"Why didn't you tell me of your en
gagement to Mary Gordon the other
night?"
"Partly because she asked me no* fo
partly bee i In't tnink it would
interest you."
"You are very modest."
"WouU it have intere
"lt doesâ immer.sely. What an irre
pressible flirt you are!"
"Do you expect me to sit up at mid
night with a pretty woman, and not
flirt with her? Why else did you send
for me to come here?"
[Continued Next Sunday.]THE SUNDAY
CALL'S 50$ A WEEK PRIZE STORY
ft OSHUA GRINGUS had farmed a
I fortune out of his holding in the
\ foothills and, being an ardent ex
#Â»] pansionist. longed for a wider
scope to his agricultural bent.
Being a Yankee, his innate spirit of
Industry wouldn't allow him to "saw
off" and feast on the fruits of his la
bor, for he believed In the strenuous
life and found supreme satisfaction
In his endeavor to make every hour
tell in dollars and cents. From the
doorway of his cottage on thÂ« hill
eidc- he looked down on a prospect of
beautiful valley land, about ten miles
equare, and said to himself: "Jest let
me get hold of that Tierra raneho and
I'll teach them infernal greasers what
a Yank Can do with soil like that. I've
no eurthly use for such cattle as
Don Pagare de la Tierra. Look at
that land of his â no richer in all Cal
ifornia: â and, hang me, if he ain't
Â»oing bust on it. Well, he's a blasted
prodigal anyhow, and I'll be switched
If his tribe of young ones don't inherit
hi? financial jeligion â 'In at the spigot
and out at the bung!' "
For years Gringus had kept a busi
ness eye on Raneho de la Tierra, con
vinced it was only a question of time
till the Don would surrender Ms de
linquent estate to somebody possessed
of enterprise and ambition, and the
American nourished the hope that the
name of that particular somebody
would be Joshua Gringus.
The Gringuses were peculiarly well
mated. Joshua was tall and slim; his
epouse, shorter by half, but twice as
stout. Joshua's face was chiefly nose,
vhile his wife's nasal organ was al
most lost in the valley between her
big, red hills of cheeks. Joshua's
mouth was wide, straight-cut and
thin-lipped; his better halfr> small,

round and double. The man's eyes

His hair was sandy; hers brown.
Joshua had no religion in his make
tip, but his wife had enough for two.
For the advantage of both, each vied
the other in the practice of econ
omy. They had one child â a son,
Joshua junior â but he was grown up
now anfl studying law at the univer
sity. The elder Joshua get great ex
pectations on the boy and all the Grin
gus gains were being pned up soleiy
for Joshua junior.
Mrs. Gringus shared not only her
husband's fortunes, but also his likes
and dislikes, and she dreamed the
same dreams about Raneho de la
Tierra. She read her Bible every day
regularly and had a special fondness
for the book of Joshua, believing
there was a deal of virtue in a name
and persuading herself that Don Pa
gare and his family were like unto
the enemies of the chosen people. In
fact, she took it for granted that
Joshua Gringus was ordained to rqpt
them out of the valley even as the
successor of Moses had rooted the
Anakim out of Hebron.
"Those De la Tierras never ought
love had the land in the beginning."
declared Mrs. Gringus. "They never
worked a lick for it and they never de
served it. Didn't you tell me that a
Spanish King took that land away,
from the missionaries and put the
Tierras on it because they happened
to be related to some grandee or
other?"
"Something like that," replied Joshua,
"Well, they never planted a tree nor
a vine on the place, and they wouldn't
improve that thick-walled adobe of
theirs if they lived in it a hundred
years. Yes, and they mightn't have
had that adobe if the missionaries
hadn't put it there."
"It dont matter much," said Joshua.
"The Don's purty nigh the end of his
string, and if our agent in town makes
the right" dicker I'll own the plasters
on his grant before he knows it. The
mortgagee needs ready money and I've
got it. The Don hasn't been keeping
up his interest, and unless he unloads
his stock at record-breaking prices
there'll be an exodus of his tribe inside
of a year."
The dicker was made. The agent se
em ed the notes, and Gringus, master
of the situation, considered the land
in the valley as good as acquired.
Almost needless to relate, Joshua had
never been on familiar terms with Don
Pagare. He couldn't tolerate "greas
ers." Once, It is true, he and Mrs.
GringU6 had gone down to a fiesta Just
for curiosity's sake, the occasion being
the anniversary of Mexican independ
ence. Knowing the De la Tierras to be
overhead in debt, they were shocked at
the extravagance revealed.
"I suppose they've got a thousand
people here," observed Joshua, "and
darnod If they ain't giving the who'e
celebration free. Look at those big
barrels over there under the trees â
that's wineâ all free as water, by gosh!"
The scene of the barbecue reminded
Mrs. Gringus of something she had
read about cannibals. Long trenches
had been converted into furnaces of
live coals and the meat wan spitted on
iron rods, the ends of which r?sted on

sizzled over the coals and the aroma
made an excellent appetizer tjr the
multitude. The meat was liberally
salted and still more liberally peppered,
and presently the people round about

the majority taking it in their hands

Indiars.
"The sight of thi3 is all the barbecue
I want," murmured Mrs. Gringus.
"Me, too," seconded Joshua. They
strolled over to a newly built platform
and watched the antics of the dancers.
They could see little harmony in the
Ed morning, afternoon and evening,
and the most remarkable testimonies
have come from lips hitherto sealed.
Natural public assembling places, like
railway stations and' platforms, and

half an hour earlier in order not to
take any time from their employers.
So widespread and profound has been
the revival that religous leaders from
other parts of Great Britain and even
from the Continent have gone to
Wales simply to study the phenomena
and catch the enthusiasm.
"But are not gush and cant the
main things in this revival?" Not at
all. The notable feature has been the
immediate effect upon the moral life
of the Welsh people. Patronage of
the saloons has fallen off tremendous
ly. The magistrates have had far
fewer. cases to try. Drunkards, gam
movements of the twinkling feet, and
were dumfounded to learn that two
orchestras were on hand, dividing the
time, one resting while the other
played.
The Gringuses didn't wait for the
bareback riding and riata- throwing.
They had seen enough, and they went
home with a harder opinion of the Don
than they had entertained before.
"In at the spigot and cut at the
bung," repeated Joshua.
It was almost midsummer now. and,
after the haying, a breathing spell had
come. Joshua was anxious to size up
things on Raneho de la Tierra and so,
accompanied by Mrs. Gringus, he drove
biers, infidels and agnostics have faced
completely about. The homes-of hun
dreds of people saddened by the ex
cesses of some of their members have
been completely transformed. Shop
keepers have received thousands of
dollars In discharge of old debts
which they had long ago credited to
profit and loss.
One of the most remarkable outcomes
has been the sweetening of relations
between different classes in the com
munity. For a number of years a bit
ter industrial struggle has been waging
at the celebrated Penrhyn quarries,
alienating members of the same house
hold and causing estrangements which
promised to be lifelong. But now men i
and women have sought one another's
forgiveness and an atmosphere of peace
and goodwill prevails.
The testimony of competent, cool, dis
interested outsiders is to the effect that
this Welsh revival has meant already
a moral transformation for the Welsh
people, and has been accompanied by '
almost nothing purely sensational or
objectionable. '

down on the pretense of getting Infor
mation for a cattle-buyer.
A troop of young De la Tierras raced
to open the gate for them, and when
they drew near the casa, other De la
Tierras were ready to assist them out
and care for the horse. Don Pagare
rose from a seat on the long veranda
and, taking a cigarette from between
bis Hds, made a brief speech of wel-
Mra. Gringus mentally noted the
Iarette. Somebody had told her
iat the Don was everlasting
y smokingâ that he smoked as
i soporific when he went to bed
ind as an eye-opener when he
iwoke; smoked before meals
s an appetizer and after meals
3 an aid to digestion; smoked
ten the temperature was high
cool off, and when it was low
â  warm up; smoked for friend
>'3 sake, and then again for spite;
>Ked when he was thinking and also
when he wasn'tâ while at other times
he smoked for the sake of smoking.
She perceived now that his face bore
the color and greasy appearance of the
skin of a smoked ham. His fingers,
stained -with nicotine, looked as if they
had been dipped in iodine. The Don
was low-natured, but would have been
called well-fed. He wasn't bad look
ing, for he had clean-cut, regular fea
tures, and brilliant black eyes; and he
seemed to take delight In sbowin% his
milk-white teeth, which. Mrs. Gringus
was certain, were false. There was no
denying the fact, however, that the
Don was the pink of politeness. After
seating the Gringuses on the veranda,
and before they could enter a protest,
he brought out a small table, on which
one of his children, following on his
heels, set a tray containing glasses and
a decanter of wine. This display oÂ£
hospitality was vain, for Joshua didn't
dare imbibe in his wife's presence, and
Mrs. Gringus abominated the sight of
an intoxicant.
Don Pagare was profuse in his ex
pressions of gratification at the honor
of the visit, and he experienced sincere
pleasure in furnishing all the informa
tion desired. He was eager that the
Americans should meet his daughter,
Margarita, who had just returned from
a young ladies' seminary and spoke the
language of the visitors perfectly.
Margarita was unlike any De ia
Tierra picture the Gringuses had ever
framed in their minds. She was un
commonly fair and grace personified.
Mrs. Gringus pronounced the girl's
features angelic. Certainly her big,
lustrous, dark eyes were the kind that
conquered hearts and enslaved poets.
She was the cultured one of the family
and spoke English with an accent that
was music to the ear. The remainder
of the De la Tierra femininity kept se
cluded.
"How do you like to be back on the
ranch?" inquired Mrs. Gringus of the
girl.
"I love it," replied Margarita, "and
now I shall make my father fulfill his
promise to build an imposing Casa
de la Tierra. This ancient adobe does
not comport well with the beauty of
our little kingdom. Do you not think
I am right?"
Of course they thought so, or at least
they expressed themselves that way.
Still, when they bade Don Pagare
"Adlos," (which was about all the
Spanish they knew), Mrs. Gringus
couldn't help heaving a sigh, "Poor
Margarita!" On the way home Joshua
said, "Darned if I wouldn't like to
have a daughter like that:" A happy
thought, tinctured with a feeling akin
to mercy, flitted across his brain. His
boy at college figured in the thoughtâ
but he kept it to himself.
The magnificen/ De la Tierra grant
was used almost exclusively for cattle
raising. The wheat and barley patches
supplied nothing to the market; neither
did the old mission trees and vines, nor
the ill-kept garden in which the frijole
plant was prominent and in which also
grew those essential ingredients of the
buxom tamale â corn, tomatoes and
peppers. In the trees and haysheda
abode the fowls which lent the quali
fying adjective to the torrid creation
with the corn husk wrapper and olive
heart.
On the uncultivated land a mine of
agricultural gold might Lave been
plowed up; but the Don was not fond
of plowing and stuck to cattle, while
his expenses ran further and further
ahead of his income. Americans on
small tracts had sowed bread and pros
pered, and were now planting fruits
that promised larger profits, while the
Don courted pleasure and avoided life's
serious claims. His "to-day" was for
enjoyment; his "to-morrow" for busi
ness; but "to-morrow" was always
coming.
The Don reached the unfortunate
stage where he could borrow no more
money on his land, while the sale of
his cattle would hardly suffice to pay
the long overdue interest. No matter.
It was folly to worry and he concluded
to offer a band of steers to Gringus
for the needed "dinero."
Unusual circumstances brought his
neighbor jinexpectedly to the rancho.
Two of Joshua's best cows had been
killed by mountain lions and the
Yankee rode down to enlist the sons
of De la Tierra in a hunt for the com
mon enemy.
"I'm nearly as much afraid of them
greasers now as of mountain lions,"
declared Mrs. Gringus, as her husband
left her at the door. "Them De la
Tierras know mighty well about their
mortgages and they haven't got a
sjark of love for you. Them'3 the
kind of people that lays in wait and
stabs in the back, or shoots from be
hind. Be careful, Joshua! I've actu
ally had dreams of a horrible fuss be
tween you and the Don!"
Gringus acquainted the Don with
the facts of. the invasion by wild
beasts, and the Spaniard summoned
his sons and rattled off something in
his own tongue.
"Pronto," he cried, and the boys
proceeded to the stable, to return
astride mustangs and with an extra
mount for the Don. They procured
rines at the casa and awaited orders.
Meantime the Don had broached thÂ«
subject of a cattle sale, urging Joshua
to go out for a few minutes and taka
a look at the steers for himself.
Joshua cantered up the side hill to
ward his own dividing line, where the
herd was resting under the spreading
oaks.
Don Pagare could see Joshua ap
proaching the cattle in the distance,
bur was suddenly startled by an omin
ous movement of the herd. A mad
rearing and bellowing was followed by
a stampede and a cloud of dust came
rolling down the valley. In front of it.
spurring his horse and riding for life,
was Gringrua.
The Don leaped into his saddle, and,*
with his sons, advanced into the open
field. The American's danger had evi
dently vanished. His strong, swift
steed gained steadily on the pursuing
column. He was leading the herd by
a hundred yards and was only half the
distance from the casa, when, to the
horror of the onlookers, his animal
stumbled and fell, throwing the rider,
who lay motionless, while the horse,
rolling over and regaining its feet, re
sumed Its flight.
On came the blind, infuriated herd.
nearer and nearer, and the dust cloud
rose like a gigantic pall. Gringus re
covered his senses sufficiently to ap
preciate his frightful perli. His
ears were filled with the noise of
the hoofbeats. The very earth shook,
and, in his Imagination, he felt his
flesh torn by sharp horns. He strug
gled to rise, but weakness bore him
down, and his hope expired. He sank,
face to the ground. Great God! There
was trampling of hoofs on either aidÂ©
of him now. Death stood over him
and he awaited the stroke. Then he
felt himself raised to his feet and
heard a voice.
"Nombre de Dios, el fusil!" cried
the Don.
Shots rang out, and then, before
Joshua could fully realize what was
happening, he was lifted into the arms
of the Don, whose mustang, carrying
the twain, was spurred on to safety.
A half dozen steers had been killed
to hold back the herd, but that was
nothing. The Don thought not of the
loss, but of a triumphâ he had saved a
human life! At the casa he smoked
and smiled with pride.
Gringrua was still weak when the
De la Tierras conveyed him home. His
face was vÂ»ry white, and when Mrs.
Gringus saw him coming up the road
in the De la Tierra wagon she knew
something desperate had occurred.
"My God, they've killed himâ they've
killed him," she cried, wringing her
hands.
The Don happily misunderstooJ.
Springing from the rig and running
forward, sombrero in hand, he en
treated Mrs. Gringus to be calm. "Ee'a
all seguro.' he assured her. "Ee's
coming near to killing senorâ but ee'3
no killâ Gracias a Dios! â cc's no kill!"
Gringus was helped out of the
wagon, and his tearful spouse kissed
his pallied face lovingly, took him in
her arms and almost carried him into
the cottage.
"Tell me, Joshua." said Mrs. Grin
gus, when they were alone, "are you
sure it wasn't a put-up job?"
'Wife." said the man, '"don't say an
111 word of the Don. God knows I owe
my life to him! The hoofs of the herd
were almost upon me â I gave way in
despair; but the Don â the 'greaser,' we
used to call him â the Don put his life
between me and the fate that over
hung!"
"Lord forgive me for wronging him.
then."
"It's toughâ it's tough to think."
said Joshua, "that I'm lawing to turn
them out of their horne â to drive them
out of the valley."
"Hush," put in his wife. "Think of
Joshua junior. It don't pay to mix up
sentiment with business: Don't tha
Bible say 'To him who hath shall be
given and from him who hath not shall
be taken away even that which ha
hath? Buy the Don a dollar's worth of
cigarettesâ he'll think Just as much
of you. He cant keep the place no
how." Ard that settled it.
Some weeks afterward Gringus paid
two thousand dollarsâ a big price â for
the Don's castle. De la Tierra was more
than satisfied. Now, the Don had
never, in twoscore years, failed to cele
brate Mexican independence day, and
the memorable 16th of September came
again. On Raneho de la Tierra, as of
yore, there was feasting, racing, games
and dancing. The Don had invited all
the country, and he gave bread, meat,
wine, music â everything â free.
"That eats up the two thousand,"
said Joshua. "But," he confided to his
wife, "I've got an idea our Joshua
Junior might take a shine to Margarita
and. if she was willing, whyâ a mar
riage like that would be a darned
nice thing!" The subject was brought
up as soon as the younger Joshua
reached home from college; butâ there
it was againâ Joshua Junior had al
ready married a city girl and had hur
ried home ahead of his companion to
break the news gently to mother.
Another year went by. A new lortl
â the Yankee â ruled over Raneho de la
Tierra, and he astonished the natives
by giving a fiesta on Mexican inde
pendence day. Joshua junior wanted
it so, and Joshua junior had his way.
Among the guests were Don Pagare
de la Tierra and his family. They had
an income from the boys, who had
hired out as vaqueros. They ate.
drank, danced: the Don rolled and
smoked one cigarette after another,
and all were light hearted and gay
all save Margarita, whose beautiful
face was sad. Long she gazed at the
sriendid mansion that replaced the old
adobe. Once she had dreamed of a
noble Casa de la Tierra there, and â
she wished she had dreamed forever.PEARL fishing has always been
somewhat of a mystery, and is,
in fact more or less so to this

In*. Each ar.d every one means a
deal of labor, th*Â» risking of a human
life and a certain expenditure of
money. Not so man> years ago pearl-
Ing meant next door to nothing, but
r.owadays It has sprung into promin
ence and is rapidly pushing itself into
the world of commerce. For pearl
fishing is not a pastime or something
to "be taken up during the summer*
vacation; instead it is a business that
must be handled carefully and ?clen
, tlficaily to make It worth while.
The modern diving apparatus is
responsible for this new trade, for
â up to the time of Its invention nude
divers were employed and tfcc result
was the recover*- of but a limited sup
ply of shell and pearls. The diver
â¢ took his life in his hands and went
under to do his very best. But his
best was scarcely worth speaking of.
His limit of duration was but a few
seconds and his field within his arm's
reach, so oaf can easily Bee That his
chare of the ocean's spoils would not
. e<ron place him in the ranks of the
millionaires.
But these days it is entirely differ
ent. In the first place, the Govern
â¢ ment put a stop to nude workers, for
the sharks were busy plying their
trade at the same time, and when the
â¢ two came together there was bound
to-be a grai. ". crash. Besl'-s this, the .
diving apparatus was placed on the
market and in no time every diver
was enabled to remain under water
from one to three hours, according
to the depth of the â¢ter. and to gath
er more than twenty natural divers
â¢"could possibly glean.
â¢ " Looking for pearls to be fashioned
. Into rings, pins and other gewgaws
â¢ Is but a part of the business and the
â¢ smallest part, too, by the way. The
ehells themselves are what really
count- Day after day no pearl of any
market value Ib found, but the shell
Is cleaned and boxed ready for ship
ping, and they fetch anywhere from
$50 to $75 a hundred weight.
- Of oysters there are two kinds that
â¢ particularly Interest the dealer. The
one that is found in all parts of the
world, even along the coast of Cali
fornia, and that is valuable only for
' the pearl that it may contain. The
other, commonly known as the
"mother o" pearl," produces the largest
' pearls, but it is mainly gathered for
the shells, a single pair often weigh
â¢ ing when cleaned and dry as much as
â eighteen pounds. When I tell you
that as much as 3000 tons of mother
& pearl shell reaches the London mar
ket every year, you can easily realize
that it is an industry of no small con
'â  sequence. It has been calculated that
the annual take of a single boat Is
about five tons, and that the value
per ton ranges from $600 to $2400,
according to the size and condition of
the shells.
In Australia this business means not
Â» "a-. little. In the first place there are
about 900 boats and schooners con
| tetantly employed, each one represent
ing an outlay of some $4000.
Of course, this means the employ
ment of many people, and while a great
many are imported into the country
under a three-year contract, many
Australians are dependent upon the in
dustry for a living. In fact, it has
been rudely figured out that fully 6000
men owe their daily bread and butter
to the oyster and Its spoils.
The laws of Australia have always
been very generous and any foreigner
coming In and paying the stipulated
price for privileges and protection may
go about his business with perfect free
dom. So it stands to reason that men
of all nationalities have sailed in with
their boats, one, two or three, and are
spending their lives in the expectation
I ( making a big find one of these fine
' days. But do not Imagine for a single
â¢ moment that the trusts have missed
such a big country as Australia or such
1 a promising field as the oyster bed.
: That would be too much Joy to expect
these days. Indeed, the trust is there
and there with a vengeance, too. And
to show you how insignificant our
American trusts are, I am going to tell
you of the latest and biggest of all
trusts.
â¢ Some of the big English companies
' rut their heads together and decided
that they were not making quite as
rouch money as they should. Their
profits were big, it wa* true, but not
quite enough on the amount of the
capital expended.' They looked to see
the cause of all the trouble and their
eagle glance fell on a multitude of
boats owned by small companies' and
smaller owners. That v.ag the story in
a nut shell. Too many people. The
ocean was being robbed of its treas
ures too rapidly and the tiny oysters
were not given a fair opportunity to
grow.
Off to a member of Parliament they
new with their grievances and it didn't
take very long to hatch up the Idea
to lease the ocean. Now fancy. Did
anybody ever hear of such a bill be
fore? Well, the result was a mass
meeting: of the small traders, t*-Â»
owners of floating and stationary mer
chandise stores and the people depend
ent upon pearl fishing in general. They
v.ere willing that certain parts of the
ocean be closed up for a period of five
years but they wanted the privilege of
fishing elsewhere In the meantime free
or charge. The idea of sailing into a
buoy and reading "For sub-lease apply
to Jim Smith" didn't appeal to them
In the least and thÂ»y couldn't exactly
figure out why the rich man shou'd
build a fence around the ocean any
how and say 'this belongs to me."
So the mats Bieeting went to work.
When the opportunity presented Itself
they asked if the sky and the sunshine
were apt to be bottled and retailed to
the highest bidder, and if they were to
be allowed a little moonshine free of
charge. In Bhort, they held the whole
matter up In such a ridiculous light
that houses of Parliament smiled in a
r.onchalant fashion and said It "would
be a shame to rob America, of her
high position in the trust line."
Bo the old ocean goes scot free this
time and we small people may go on
hoping and watching for the pearla
that never come.
For be it known to the uninitiated
that the majority of pearla taken are
of poor quality and comparatively
valueless, though now and then gems
are found valuing as much as $5000 to
$7600 each, and on the average each
ton of shell produces pearls to the
value of 1400.
Coarse ones of extraordinary size
ere sometimes obtained, and now that
baroque pendants, necklaces and Jew
elry of all kinds are so fashionable, the
price has gone up for such oddities.
Official statistics regarding the take
of pearls are not at all reliable, and
many pearls never reach the hands of
the owners, but are retained by the
divers and disposed of by them secret
ly at a price much below their real
value. As the best specimens of
pearls and shells are found in deep
water, the diver has a splendid oppor
tunity to Investigate if he has any rea
son to believe that a pearl of any value
has been discovered, and as he cannot
very well be watched, who is to be the
wiser? Ordinarily the shells arÂ«
opened by the owner or his represen
tative, who live on board the boat
and examine for pearls. If none are
discovered the shell Is thrown Into a
box near at hand and the fish con
sumed by the crew or thrown away.
Upon shell and shell alone do the
pearlers rely for subsistence, but the
pearls are regarded as nice little ad
ditions to one's income. With the
exception of prospecting for gold
there is probably no occupation more
fascinating than pearling. As each
shell is picked up it Is an unknown
quantity. It may contain a bit of mud
and it is Just possible that a small
piece of creamy white may make
your bank book Jump ahead some five
or s!x thousand. It Is the glorious
uncertainty that holds men and
sends them cruising about in the trop
ical waters that contain untold dan
gers for them.
The ocean is rather crafty and
clevsr about her transactions, too.
When the "tenderfoot" puts In an ap
pearance she seems to know It and
throw* out a tempting bait to lure
him on. When I first went Into the
business she sent me a rare gem with
her compliments and told me that I
could market It for no less than
J6OOO. Then when I was filled to the
brim with enthusiasm, she closed up
shoj> and ha* taken a vicious delight
in keying me on the anxious seat
ever elnce.
Of course now and then a lucky
find Is made, and some exceedingly
beautiful and valuable gems are dis
covered, but more often, however, the
pearls that are found are either badly
shaped or otherwise defective. To be
of any value a pearl must possess, in
in addition to a good color and luster,
â  certain well defined shape. That is,
it must be either a round pearl, drop
or button. A drop is ovarl or pear
shaped, and a button is similar to a
rcund pearl button somewhat flat
tened.

rock or coral or even a tiny piece of
mud finds its way between the shell
and causes an irritation. The oyster
must drink now and then. and even
though it opens its double doors a
very little wav the sea water -ashes
in a grains two of sand that makes
It decidedly uncomfortable. Just C as
goon as the ragged atom begins to _ cut
and hurt Its flesh it contrives toover
come enemy by returning good for
ti eviL In the oyster's body there Is a
* little store of clean and precious fluid
with which it makes its mother o pearl
â¢on its shell. So it pours a little of the
nacre gently over the grain of sand
and makes it smooth and round and
white. After this the annoyance and
the pain cease, for the sharp, rugged
points are neatly and nicely covered
In a beautiful, snowy case. And this is
what we call a pearl. Such is the
oyster's revenge. Instead of fighting
the little foe that hurts it so cruelly.
I It closes and heals Its wound with a
pearl.
Sometimes a pearl will become at
tached to the inner * surface of the
shell, and, if left undisturbed, the fish
will probably Incorporate it with the
â hell itself by depositing layer after
layer of nacre over It.
The result is called a "blister." and
Is by the way. a delightful uncer
tainty, for they do not necessarily
contain pearls. Anything that the fish
objects to, but which it cannot get rid
of is built Into the shell whether it
is good or bad This watchword of the
â  pearler Is hope, and it is for this rea
son that pearl-buyers and speculators
frequently purchase a promising blis
ter at a high price, trusting to find a
valuable gem. Should the hope be
realized, and occasionally It Is. the
hidden pearl may possibly be worth
ten times the amount paid. But, on
the other hand, nothing more precious
than a bit of hardened mud may dis
close itself. .
Wit is difficult sometimes to believe
that black magic has not been used
when a single pearl turns out to be a
handsome smooth one by a few mystic
strokes. Yet in the hands of an ex
pert apparently worthless pearls are
sometimes quickly converted into val
uable gems. Sometimes after the
fashion of an onion, it is possible to
remove skin after skin until either a
good pearl is disclosed or . a piece of
nacre proved to be utterly worthless.
For Instance, I saw m rough, ugly
lump reduced from over a hundred
grains to fifty-seven grains and the re
sult was a beautiful drop pearl- which
waj sold for about $6000.
The pearl fishing Industry Is carried
on altogether by Asiatic labor, such
as Japanese. Filipinos, Chinese and
South Sea Islanders. Some few are im

Government for a term of three

could not be induced to work for the
same wages that these natives do. for
they are perfectly happy and consider
themselves lucky if they draw down
the princely amount of 25 cents a day.
The diver is the onl 1 " high-priced em
ploye, and for his services he receives
the v immense * sum of $15 a month
and an additional $100 for every ton
of shell that he raises. A good ex
perienced deep water diver will raise
, as much as six tons of shell during
the season's work, or - about nine
months. So you see, he really makes
In the neighborhood of 5750 a year.
The tender, who has charge of sail-
Ing the boat and \. looking after the
diver's . life - line, gets $15 also, though
that Is ! the extent of his wages, as he
1 receives no ' percentage. The , crew,
who comprise a diver, a tender, a cook
and four sailors, are not \ permitted to
go ashore during their . contract with
out : a * written order from their mas
ters, and as the laws are-- very strict
. upon this subject, they ' have no par-
H ticular fondness for the shore and are
perfectly contented and willing to re

. Getting and retaining good divers
is a strenuous 1 , bit of business and as
so much depends upon them, it is an
all important one. : He knows to a T
> : what l localities , have ; been raked, and
the master pearler is able to figure, to
a certain degree, on his profits. >, But
to do all this he frequently has â  the
pleasure of advancing large sums of
money, sometimes the entire year's
earnings, and he very often is forced
to raise his salary a little, for whoever
offers the highest advances and the
highest wages secures the diver's ser
vices, quite as a matter of course.
The position of the tender is really
one of great responsibility, for the
diver's life frequently depends upon
the care and vigilance exercised by
him. While the diver is on the. bot
tom he must keep all his wits about
htm. Not one must go wool gather
ing, for he has three important thing*
which demand careful and unremit
ting attention â the life line, the air
pipe and the plummer line, a thin
rope used for signaling 1 . The vessel
Is usually allowed to drift. To be sure
the anchor is ; wn, but its Cukes are
Â»o adjusted that the speed of the drift
Is controlled. As the diver slowly
travels the sea-bed, he picks up what
shells he sees and places them in a
network bag which is attached to his
dress for that purpose. When full he
sends the Das' to the surface in re
sponse to a signal communicated by
means of the signal line. When it is
emptied, down it goes again only to
be refilled with another load.
The oyster is clever as can be. but
not quite as clever as a keen eyed
diver. As you know, it is blind, but
instinct tells it that some sort of a
commotion Is in progress and that a
mighty foe is near at hand. So away in
the mud it huddles, hiding itself from
the enemy, and all that is seen is a
little rough disturbed place in the mud
and a few bubbles that escaped while
the oyster was busy closing and bolt-
Ing: its doors. But being still doe* no
good in this case, for the tell-tale dis
turbance is there and the oyster is
rudely snatched from its comfortable
home and bundled forthwith off to
London to make pearl buttons with
â which vain people may adorn them
selves.
In comparatively shallow water the
diver is in clover, for he can remain
down continuously, only coming ud for
meals, but in the deep water it is quite
another story. For instance, in twenty
or twenty-five fathoms he remains
down nor longer than six or eisht
minutes at a stretch. Occasionally
when he chances to find a bed of oys
ters he remains a little lonirer for fear
he will be unable to locate It azain.

Diving operations are conducted in
varying depths of water, from a few
fathoms to as great a depth as the
diver is capable of attaining. To coun
teract the pressure of the water sum
cient alp must always be retained in
the dress to keep it distended and
away from the body. The pressure^
th !., water Increases with the depth,
until the limit is reached at which \ne
diver must choose between being ruf
focated by the tremendous air pressure
or being crushed by the great pressure
of the water. A depth of twenty-flva
fathoms Is often attained, but only '
with great risk. The amount of air
pumped into the dress is always prac
tically the same, but the helmet Is fur
nished with a valve by which the diver
Is enabled to control the amount to bÂ«*
retained within the dress, any excess
being allowed to escape. In this way
you see. he is able to please himself to
a greater or less degree.
To a novice a descent In the dlvlnsj

experience. As he is lowered Into thÂ©
water a sense of utter helplessness
overcomes him. and he begins to won

White duck and crash are made Into
trotters and thin embroidered waists
are worn with them, but alas and
alack, how forlorn and bedabbled they
look after a climb and how absolutely
foolish after a picnic in the woods.
Strictly speaking, an outing suit is
an outing suit and absolutely nothing
else. To bt a good one it must be
made for rough and ready wear, of a
color that is nondescript and of a
fabric that is strong yet pliable. And
tailored, by the way, strictly so.
This answers the description of a
fuit that has been turned out, so do
you wonder that I say the outing girl
Is in clover.
Three shades this suit comes in.
' reen bronze, brown and tan, and in
ariety of materials from wash
goods to English corduroy. The Jacket
Is made after the regulation Norfolk
that has been used as a fishing
Jacket for years, and its only devia-

skirt flapping about and hanging down
in a cold, disagreeable fashion.
Boots she has had of late years and
thigh boots at that, so that she has
been practically dry, but the minute
she stepped into the stream above her
knees away floated the skirt and no
matter how carefully she tucked it into
her belt it always found some means
of escape. But that discomfort is a
thing of the past, for a skirt that is
a triumph of cunning has been fash
ioned to cheat the waters.
To all appearances it is quite like
all other short skirts, the only differ
ence being that It opens on the side
or directly in front. But there is a
difference and it all lies with an array
of tapes that are fastened to the in
side of the skirt. Five or six of them
there are, that are sewed firmly to the
seams and that come directly to the
waist line, where they run through
â¢small rings ready to be fastened about
the waist. If the skirt is the right
length the strings are not touched and
are not an inconvenience by any man
ner of means, but when the water be
gins to flap disagreeably near the dan
ger line, the strings are given a hitch
or so-, and lo and behold, the skirt rolls
up evenly and smoothly as high as one
pleases. Up to the very waist It may
be rolled and when tied is as â  secure
and trim as can be.
This same fishing lady has a brand
new hat, too, and the quaintest little
piece of milllnerv out. There Isn't a
blessed thing about it to spoil by the
water or to fade by the sun and when
it has knocked about camp until it is

Bent to the laundry with the rest of
the suit and comes home fresh and
none the worse for wear. It is fash
ioned more like a man's small round
hat with a round top and a curling
small brim than like anything else I
can think of. It is small, delightfully
so, and sits jauntily on the head and is
adjusted according to the sun. If the
Fun is too warm on the neck, the back
brim is given a little twist and It
settles down immediately into a she 3
affair that is very grateful. When lie
pun works a little to the side, the brim
follows it until the glare on the water
makes It unpleasant and the front fol
lows suit. It 1b not necessary to have
the brim down all the way around un
less one pleases, for It is a sort of up
and down affair that stays Just where
it is put and makes not the least ob
jection.
And Miss Traveler, let me tell you a
little secret while I think of it. Made
of black taffeta they are the most
fetching little creations to travel In
that can be Imagined. No amount of
jamming, packing and sitting on In
jures them in the least and they bob up
serenely after a hard Journey and come
home in splendid condition. And that
is infinitely more than can be said of
any other hat that I know of this sum
mer, when everything seems to be bil
lows of lace' and quantities of fancy
braids and flowers.
Of course the outing girl has other
hats, plenty of them, but they are
neither new nor strikingly pretty. Cer
tainly the water-proof fishing hat is a
convenience, but It cannot very well be
used for other occasions, and for this
reason is being relegated to the back
shelf, unless one has plenty of trunks
and plenty of space. The felt som
brero is another hat that has always
been popular, and is even yet for its
solid comfort, but when it is warm the
felt is hot and heavy and when there

JBANNIBJ (Red Face).â Generally
when the face is red and coarse and
overheated It is a case of diet and
not of cosmetics. Begin a diet and
see if it will not help you. Do not
eat too much meat nor starchy foods,
and as the spring is coming on you
really do not need food for warmth,
but for repairs. Eat quantites of veg
etables, green salads, plenty of fruit
and fish. At noon eat a bowl of bread
or milk or crackers and milk. It
really is all you need, and it certainly
â¢will give you time to catch up and
repair both your stomach and your
complexion. Have you ever tried
almond paste or oil? It is not sup
posed to irritate the skin and will
keep it soft and white. Strawberries
make many excellent cosmetics, and
I am going to give you two recipes
that will help you if anything will.
One is a toilet water that is diluted
with water for tan, burn, or any of the
little unpleasant trifles that always
seem to come along so serenely.
Finest ripe strawberries, crushed,
8 pounds; pure alcohol, 2 quarts.
Digest and distill near to dryness in
salt or steam bath. This is both
agreeable and most fragrant.
The strawberry cream is made as
follows:
Put six ounces of sweet almond oil
Into the inside receptacle of a custard
boiler. Put as much water Into the
Outside boiler as though you were
about to make a custard. Set the
two, one inside the other, over *thÂ«
fire. Have ready one full quart of
large, ripe, hulled strawberries. When
the almond oil begins to warm put
the berries in. Set the custard boiler
on the back of the stove, cover the
inside receptacle and let the water
In the outside kettle simmer for four
or five hours. Take the almond oil
and the strawberries out. By tha
way. it is absolutely essential that the
berries be ripe. Let them strain
through a clean, fine cheese-cloth
bag. Do not hurry the straining pro
cess or attempt to squeeze the bag.
To six ounces of the strained liquid
add one ounce of white wax, one
ounce of spermaceti and two ounce*
of lanoline. Put all over the fire and
heat until the last three articles have
melted. Then take off the fire and
beat constantly until cold, adding dur
ing the Ideating process two teaspoon-,
fuls of tincture of benzoin, ten drops
of oil of lemon and six of oil of neroli.
This will make a delicious strawberry
cream if properly and carefully pre
pared.

LUCT (Weddings). â Yes. caterers go
any distance and serve quite as daintily
and as nicely as they do here. of
course they charge a little more, but I
know of several cases where breakfasts
have been served out of town and the
price was very reasonable. You asked
about the price. It all depends. For
instance, I know of one suppeÂ» where
creamed oysters and sandwiches,
block ice cream and fancy cakes and
black coffee were served for a dollar
a plate. The fruit punch was made at
home and was not included In the ex
penses. This means all the tables,
linen, silver and dishes generally. And
as many waiters as are necessary to
properly serve the number of guests.
I have an excellent fruit punch recipe
and will send it to you if you think
you can make use of It. I would not
use place cards. They are an expense
and really are not in the least neces
sary- L*?t the guests find their own
seats and make such little gatherings
as please them best.

At any rate it was done and he,
who had carried himself unscathed
through the campaigns of one season
af^er another, was the victimized best
man at last. Harrington felt suddenly
as ill at ease in his dress clothes as a
college boy at his first "prom."

JOTTINGS OF OLD JIM JUCKLIN
The father nodded assent, and the
mother said she wished she could think
so. Limuel replied that she could, and
without putting much of a strain on
herself. "The experiment of every
weddin* is the husband," he remarked,
looking at the young man. "No mat
ter how wise he may be, how good a
judge of a horse and the weather,
something altogether different arises in
his life when he takes unto himself a
wife. He thinks she is the simple rule
of three, but before long he finds out
that she is all mathematics, with a
side light that dazzles but don't ex
plain astronomy."
Mrs. Jucklin spoke up. "Limuel,
what are you tryin' to get at? You
would have it appear that a woman is
somethin' not to be understood."
"Oh, no, she is perfectly plain, and
so is sunshine, but nobody can't pick
it up and examine it to his own satis
faction. Woman's all right. It's the
young husband that I'm a-gettin' atâ
if I can. Marriage is a time when a
mote gets into the eye of all experience.
Things are looked at through winks,
half light and half dark; makin' a sort
of twilight for the soul; and in the

them forth to the altar rail to await
the rest of the party. They had re
hearsed the "business" last night with
half a dozen candles and supply music.
The bride would have her wedding
march played by no other than a
Western school friend, who was to ar
rive late. Down tW two aisles would
come the lines of ushers and brides
maids, the toddling ring-bearers, the
maid of honor in yellow with hat of
palest green and an armful of daffo
dils (Madeleine had confided to him
â¢all the sickening details), then the
stately bride on her father's arm. If
one must marry, Madeleine was the
right sort and Bob was getting about
the best there was.
This daffodil maid of honor was an
other of the miseries, a second out-of
town friend of Madeleine's, a pale
creature who would match her daffo
dils, bearing the impossible name of
Clarissa. If Madeleine hadn't betrayed
her over-interest in the pairing off,
and elaborated so upon his official
duties to Miss Daffodil, itâ
"Heavens. Bob! There's our cue!
Take a brace, old man; I'll stand by
you!" Then internally, "Yes, with the
heart In pie like a fistful of liquefied
air!"
Custom and good breeding save
many a day. Everything moved de
lightfully, and the breath-holding mo
ment of the ceremony arrived. That
was as far as Harrington ever got
in his memory of the occasion. At
they faced the altar his eyes were ar

well understand why she doesn't sup

stay out at night, to sniff the air of
his former reckless freedom. It's his

crown of shining auburn hair. The
Bide ot.the face was toward him and
there was a faint impression of a
ill my green gown.
It was the violent beginning of a
tempestuous end. The sight went
through him like a physical shock. He
saw only the lovely picture, heard
only the soft music that fell from the
slender fingers. The first usher prod
ded him into consciousness when the
ring was demanded, the daffodil maid
had to clutch an Unproffered arm for
the recessional.
Once outside, Harrington came
again Into his self-sufficiency. As the
second carriage came up, the yellow
confection was hustled into it, the
door slammed upon the astonished
girl, a peremptory "drive on" issued,
and a hatless young man dashed
breathlessly around the corner to the
organ entrance. Just in time! In an
other vehicle the auburn head was
being extinguished.
"The right time of all the world,
girl, of all the years that have been
for you and for meâ the right time for
the seal of the promise for those that
are to come for us," he said with quiet
Intensity, his lips closing on her unre
sisting ones.
After a moment she straightened
herself with a happy little laugh.
"I think we must be nearly there."
"Yes. "Wretchedly short drive. Oh,
girlie, girlie, I am so proud of you so
glad! What will they think of us to
be sure? I wasn't having a bit of a
good time, and now I'm ever so grate

"Why, but, dear!" It was a veritable
nature. It was her nature as an obe
dient daughter to stay at home of
nights. And when she finds that she
hasn't been strong 1 enough to remodel
his nature, she grieves in her soul."
"Many a night I've sat up waltin'
for you," said Mrs. Jucklin.
"Yes, but I came didn't I?"
"Yes," she admitted, "but at what

"Oh, I didn't have to keep track of

I want to say to Billie, that
stayln' out at night is one of the
worst habits a man can fall into. It
is the dark side of married life. No
matter how truthful a man may have
started out, it makes him more or
less of a liar. Midnight and the truth
ain't twins. And a man hasn't re
formed when he cusses himself for
bein' a fool. The wisest man feels
that he is a fool when he stays oui
too late. There ain't no reproach
more fetchin' than to see the moor
a-fadin f away in the heavens. Ol
course a man can't stay at home all
the time. The fact is I'll be hanged
if I know what he is to do. I'm nol

Dickie greeted them (how he had
managed to pass them a certain team
might have borne breathless testi
mony) in an agony of contrition. His
very first blunder. He supposed, of
course, they'd met. Clarissa had come
alone â Madeleine had been investigat
ing and wrenched from him tne whole
sad tale. Clarissa wouldn't say a
word. They sweetly forgave him and
were smilingly introduced.
"Why, Joe Harrington. What's
wrong?" The bride's brother was a
clear-headed master of ceremonies.
"You belong with Clarissa, you know."
"Yes, I know. Some mistake. Every
body excited, of course. Say. Dickie, I
can go in here Just as well. Don't
worry, old man I don't mind in the
least."
"All serene! Here, Ethel, you can
shelter this carriageless Joe." And
Dickie flew off to see that such "care
lessness as the best man's being
stranded" was not repeated.
"Ethel," mused Harrington as the
rubber wheels started, leaning forward
recollect that it ain't the healthiest of
fun If you have to lie about It to your
wife. The old idea that a man Is ex
cusable for lyin' to his wife ain't a
good one. Companions ought to be as
truthful with each other as they can.
And. above all, Billie, don't let your
wife catch you In a lie. That is about
as bad a thing aa could happen, for al
ways afterward no excuse will be valid.
I'd almost as soon be convicted of per
jury as to have my wife catch me In a
lie. You may be able to lie out of a lie
to a man; but when a woman gets the
notion you are a liar, you are, so far
as she is concerned, no matter how big
may be your reserve fund of truth.
When you have lied and she has caught
you, I am not at all certain that a gen
erous acknowledgment will pay. And
yet if you stick to it a long time must
pass before you can live it down. A
woman's memory is like the sun â it
rises fresh every mornin'. Sometimes

because he's a good dancer, but in her
heart she loves â 'truth and honor. So,
be as truthful as you can, and when
you find that you have exhausted your
stock, ask her to help you to replenish
it. Make a distress of your scarcity of
truth and she will be pleased to nurse
it. It will do her good. Marriage may
start out as a picnic, you know,, but a
picnic has its cold victuals. To sum
the whole thing up, do the best you
can. Be patient. Remember that you
are a man and that the foot of a man

"Ethel! It suits so admirably I might

The red-brown eyes met his square

I like it. She only told me Mr. Har

"You came â ?"
'"Only this afternoon."
"Why have you never come before?"
"I didn't know there was anything to
come for."
As she spoke they flashed under an
arc lamp, and bending eagerly toward
her, he caught f he shine of her eyes.
It was enough. His hands groped an
instant, then gathered in her two
warm, yielding ones.
"Oh, girl, girl!" he whispered exult
ingly, "I knew the moment I saw you
that you had come for my sake! But
how, how have I lived all this while
and never found you?"
"I cannot tell, dear, only that now is
the right time," was the low response.
Holding both her hands in one of his
own he slipped to her side and tipped
her head back against his shoulder. His
eyes sought hers in the gloom of the
carriage, glorying in the revelations
brought by the passing lights.
During the ensuing hours of the re

point of bluntness. found use for all

head was an irresistible magnet, and

The creation of posthumous heroes is

On The Off the Bread Wagon
of assistant pilot on a furniture wagon
at New Orleans. Another fellow drove,
and I steered the bureaus and bulky
bedsteads up flights of narrow stairs
built like well augers. In this genteel
manner I amassed a neat but not '
gaudy sustenance In fair weather; for
when it rained my salary and meals ;
paused at the same moment.
When not cruising in the wagon I
roomed at the home of a German wom
an in an humble quarter of the city.
She had a grown family, two of the
girls being at home. Lulu was nine
teen and reveled in a beau â a thin, pal
lid person, who wore In his shirt what
I believed, at that time, to be a dia
mond. Sadie had seen but sixteen
summers and wade* in the muck of
as many winters. Plump and rosy,
and with a great rope of yellow hair
hanging down her back, she pined in
secret. The mother dropped the flag
on anything that looked like a beau,
and in the sanctity of home Sadie
dreamed of the misty future when she
would trot In double harness with her
ideal. Poor, deluded maldenl
As an annex to the family there
dwelt in a cracker box in the back yard
two sickly runt pigsâ Henrietta and
Myrtle. Their abode was not a Joy
ous one. Stunted in body and mind
and fretful In confinement, Henrietta
and Myrtle grew peevish, morose and
melancholy. They fought and squealed
like married sisters living in one house,
but the tragic finish was drawing on
apace.
On Sundays, in the evening and on
rainy days, when the furniture wagon
hit bottom and stuck fast, I loitered in
the bosom of the German family. We
always were there in a bunch, and I
batted 300 or better in the en
tertainment class. My repertory in
cluded a cruise in a United States war
ship; and the marvelous tales of hair
breadth escapes and things that oozed
from me won Sadie's admiration and
turned her golden plait a shade lighter.
Also, I embroidered for her a silken
star of great magnitude and beauty,
such a star as the naval bluejacket
wears on the crown of his flat cap.
With a set of tin hoops brought from
the ship and some colored silk thread
I built a multi-pointed star that made
the entire household blink. At the
same time, I enmeshed Sadie's budding
passion, but was not wise to the fact
I had started something that wouldn't
stop.
On the afternoon of that same day
the mother Invited me to murder
Henrietta. The pigs in the cracker
box could go the route no longer, and
a tearful family council decided on
Henrietta. I never had assassinated
any swine; but, with the prestige of
my warless war record and the silken
star gleaming like a halo on my brow,
I agreed to shed blood. So they
brought the doomed Henrietta to me
in the kitchen, where the family as
sembled, a prey at once to furtive pain
and fresh pork.
Grasping the piglet around the mid

sausage, my faithful penknife flashed,
and Henrietta yielded up about one
spoonful of life's crimson fluid. I

work was. All work is pretty much

pot, scraped and dressed them, and
split the immature spine from snout
to tall with the penknife, the only
weapon employed in the crime. The
Job was done beautifully if I do say
it. From that moment the love-stung
Sadie worshiped at my shrine. I was
her unconscious hero In everything,
pig-sticking Included; and none but her
modest self knew the sweet story of
untold love.
As an Ideal I struck high C In two
long Jumps. Any man who could in a
single day merge the fine arts of the
ancients with the abattoir Instincts of
Armour & Co. stood out from the com
mon herd a beacon of love and hope
and happiness eternal. All I knew was
that from day to day Sadie sat as
usual in the home . circle, listening to
my lies. Jokes, repartee and bonmots,
mostly about furniture in miÃflt houses.
I never saw her alone, and never
thought of doing so, for that matter;
but all the while the silken star stunt
and the autopsy I held on Henrietta
were getting in their fatal work.
At length there came a day when
the furniture wagon palled on my
thirst for conquest, and I shipped as
cook on a Northern tugboat bound up
river. A farewell party in my honor
was pulltd off In the German family.
The mother, Lulu and her pallid beau,
his alleged diamond, the married sister,
her baby and husband, who worked In
a shot tower, and a few social neigh
bors assembled to see mÂ« off. We lap
ped up several scuttles of suds and I
never was In better form. Not until
later did I recall Sadie was not among
those present. In fact, I failed to note
her absence. At the break-up of the
party I dispersed to the tugboat and
slept In a bedless bunk below the wash
of the tide. â¢ â *
Early next morning a sad-faced
messenger arrived with a note from
Lulu concerning her little sister. Sa
die had cried all night and until 2
o'clock in the morning. The reason
she Bldestepped the farewell party
was because she loved me and feared
she would break down and show It.
The note wound up with a request for
me to return at once to Sadie. This
great trouble, sprung so suddenly,
Inspired me to show the note to the
coarse, able seamen on the tug. I
wanted advice. Some of them looked
curiously at me and others laughed,
but when I proposed to go back they
grew alarmed and tried to dissuade
me. Just the same, I went, and found
the old lady alone In the sitting-room.
She treated me with deference and
respect.
"What seems to be gnawing Sadie?"
I asked, being impervious to Cupid's
dart, and therefore fluent of speech.
"I don't know," said the mother.
"Sadie is such a funny girl. She
didn't appear to care for fellows till
she had the spell last night. '
"You don't think I've trifled with
her?"
"No, indeed," replied the mother,
much distressed. "She's in the kitch
en. Go and talk to her."
In the kitchen Sadie stood at the
table with her bare arms reposing on
a pile of dishes in the center of a
than a year or two when his parent
on his father's side became tired of liv
ing and decided to try the rest cure
in the family mausoleum. This left
Leonidas with a large family and a
still larger financial problem on his
bands. Almost any man can support
himself If he Is moderately industrious
and reasonably thrifty, but when it
comes to providing the bread and but
ter and now and then a little Jam on
the side for three or four other people
the situation is materially altered.
That was the kind of a game that Le
onidas was up against, but he never
faltered, not he. He merely shaved an
extra dollar a week off his already
mlcroscoplo expense account and put
In an additional two hours a day at the
regular union charge for overtime.
By dint of great effort he managed
to keep the family ball rolling until
some of the younger members of the
outfit began to be old enough to help a
little. When this time arrived Leoni
das thought that he could see a little

Sammy from de bunco men. He's too

when you start out to try to keep him
off de Rlalto and away from de sure

dippy. I tells me son dat he'll never
be captain of his football team if he
tries to dope out who Is de people, and

When I'd told me son dig he wasn't
satisfied yet, and he says dat de teach

right to votes In de Senate as well as
de railroads and de express companies.
So I says: "Look here, me boy. did

large pan. She had been weeping,
and a smothered sob racked her
bosom when she saw me. Being
aware that washing dishes exercises
a morbidly unwholesome effect on
girls of 16, I took Sadie by the hand
and towed her gently Into the back
yard. This was Indeed a bad break,
for when the troubled maiden beheld
Myrtle biting splinters In the bot
tom of the cracker box the scene con
jured up visions of the departed Hen
rietta and the part she had played
In our young lives.
The poor child broke down utterly.
She laid her head on my shoulder and
cried. In me there arose a series of
sensations the exact location of which
I do not now recall. I felt shocked
and foolish by turns, and yet guiltless
of. intent In bringing about such a
calamitous episode. For want of bet
ter action I feebly stroked Sadie's de
jected, dishwatery hand and begged
her to cheer up. Sadie was pretty and
nice and all that, and her distress
filled me with vast anguish. How I
mentally cursed the silken star and
Henrietta, the victim of those subtle
wiles will never know.
"Why don't you stay here?" she
asked, commandingly. "You've trav
eled enough and seen all the world;
and we like you. Some day a boat will
sink and that will be your end."
I explained the reasons for shifting
my base of operations, but the plan
did not suit Miss Sadie.
"If you will stay here In New Or
leans," she went on softly, sweetly
and tenderly, "my brother-in-law will
get you a Job In the shot tower, where
you can earn enough to keep us both."
Had a large shot tower fallen on
the back of my neck It couldn't have
Jarred any more. My works stopped,
like those of a watch dropped from a
height, and when the works resumed
it occurred to me I was confronting
a crisis. The first and only formal
proposal of marriage ever slammed at
me had landed and I was taking the
full count. Holy smoke! With the'
skill of the quick and ready liar I
handed the girl a fragrant bunch of
paper flowers.
"Sadie," I said. "It makes me dizzy
to toil in shot towers. Moreover, I'm
under contract to go on the tugboat,
and if I desert now I'll be hanged by
the neck until dead. Could you stand
that?"
A mist of tears clouded the blue
eyes, quenching the love beams there,
and I hastened to pass another bou
quet over the footlights.
"But when I've cooked everything
they have in the boat then will I coma
back to you," I promsed.
She took that as my pledge to be
her sturdy oak. and Sadie would be
my clinging vine. Then I plastered a
chaste and rapid salute upon her
blushing cheek, deeming It my duty,
and hiked out for the river front,
bound to the maiden who loved me for
my deeds alone.
At this point,* gentle reader, we
Jump a lapse of twenty years, during
which I heard no more of Sadie. A
few days ago I straggled back to New
Orleans and fell to thinking of the
little blue-eyed girl with the golden
NICHOLAS NEMO
let-up In the dim distance, but he
never made a worse mistake In his
whole life. No sooner had his brothers
and sisters arrived at an age that
would permit of such a step than they
forthwith butted headlong Into the an
cient and honorable state of matri
mony. Marriage Is a serious business
always, and It proved especially so In
this case for Leonidas. He had had
some kind of a vague idea for a num
ber of years that he would like to take
a little flyer at matrimony himself and
had postponed the evil day only until
his brothers and sisters could help Urn
take care of his aged mother. Noy
that they showed no disposition to re
lieve him of a portion of his burden
he realized that he was up against it
for keeps.
It wouldn't have been half so bad if
any one had seemed to realize what
kind of a lone hand Leonidas was
playing, but no one was wise. On the
contrary, kind friends from time to
time bore to his unwilling ears critical
comments that they had overheard
what he teaches you â only forget it. I
want you to be a great scholar â only
don't let it sink in. I'm no great
scholar, so you will always have some
one handy to put you wise, place you
next, tell you how tings really is. Take
your teacher's teachings, for dey will
do you no harm now dat you knows
what dey really means; and de teach
ers must earn a living. I suppose. But
when you need to be told de trute
about such tings, come to your dad.
He'll never loin dose dippy tings, and
can always be relied to keep his head
clear and wise."
I was glad dat Kiddle had de game
put up to him early, when it would
do him little harm. Some folks don't
hear of such tings as de teacher was
saying until dey Is too old to get over
It easy, and den It's ta-ta to ease of
mind and good digestion. What's de
use of trying to make tings de way
dey Isn't, when It's so easy to take 'em
de way dey Is?
It's in de blood of some mugs to go
dotty on reform and de rights of de
people. Once when I was to Wash
ington wit Mr. Paul he takes me to
de gallery where we could see de Sen
ate at wolk. I pipes 'em off, and Mr.
Paul was piping me off. After a while
he says, "Chames," he saya, "can you
pick ou de frens of reform and de peo
ple, and den pick out de gents dat is
here not for delr healts?"
"Dats too easy, sir," I says, and I
checks off de gang. All dose dat looks
lean and serious and eager and poor,
and had lots of coco above deir ears,
what looks like dey was hired to watch
a bank and had a tip dat a gang of
yeggmen was comin' dat way, dat
seems to be shy on valets and long on
wrinkles, dat keeps in deir seats and
listened to de speeches, I puts- down
on one side. On de odder I puts down
all de double chin boys, de lads dat
goes most to de cloak rooms for a cigar
and a nap, dat looks prosperous and
sleek and content, and was long on
braid. Somehow, men win do those
things. Maybe It's vanity. However,
I set out digging up the' past. The old
home was broken up, but I found Lulu
In the neighborhood. She was pleased
and likewise scared to see me, Â« since
I was supposed to be dead. A boat:
that sailed the day I left- twenty years .
before went under with all hands.' My
friends thought I took the derelict and
had mourned me all those yearaC
fcStill. with my corpse eliminated, the
meeting was a happy one. A spurn
of pain crossed Lulu's face when we
shook hands and she got a flash of my
$16 diamond ring. Did that sparkling
gem remind her of the pallid beau,
who, like myself, proved fickle?
Heaven forbid! It shocked me some
to learn that Sadie had married two
years after my death, but I couldn't
blame her for that. Lulu directed me
to the place and I went to call for old
time's sake.
Sadie kr.ew me In a minute and
blushed as eha led me by the hand.
A3 I had led her Into the back yard
twenty years ago, only our sentiments,
time tempered, were vastly different.
For an hour we talked, avoiding the
shot tower, and then the subject of
love's young dream came up and we
both laughed.
"My, but I was stuck on the men
tn those days." she said.
From the tone I Inferred Sadie was
not stuck on them now since: she had -
married' one. That's different. Mean- |
while Sadie dispatched fleet couriers
Into the neighborhood to round up the \
children for my inspection. She
brought out the silken star. I made
twenty years ago and the sight of it
pleased '-. me much. I was glad about
the star and a warm spot glowed In 'my
breast for the woman. who had not f<>r
gotten It. . Soon the children came
whooping In, led by a plump and rosy
girl with the golden braid down her
back â the Sadie of twenty years ajro.
My thoughts grew lumpy and a wistful
look stood in the -mother's eyes
when I took the little fat hand and
caressed it.
"This Is Henrietta, my eldest.** the
woman said simply.
Like one stricken dumb, I bent my
head in silent awe and wonder. That
well-spring of human devotion was too
deep for my rope. Right there dawned
the conviction that the first opening
buds of true love, larded with pork and.
mustard in the virgin breast, can never,
never die; for Henrietta, you remem
ber, was the name of the pig .whose
death gave birth to my romance. And. ~
oh, how lightly had I cast aside the fit
ful god, who comes . not at set com
mand!
At once I became a Blighted Being
and waddled away without another
word for one more look at the sHot
tower. There was I, old and beefy and
bald, plugging on alone through life.
Twenty years of bliss gone forever, and
years of misery, perhaps, yet to come.
The shot tower still stood where I
spurned It In the burning past. Moss
and ivy draped the tall stone shaft,
and the base had gone to ruin. . A po
liceman told me the Institution on
which I might have Teared a hairoy
about the quality and cut of his clothes
and his lack of a truly gentlemanly
and Impressive bearing. Leonidas
might have pointed out to the critics
that it is extremely difficult to bring
up a family on a small income and be
a gentleman at the same time. In ad
dition to his other troubles the mem
bers who had been added to the fam
ily circle through the various entang
ling matrimonial alliances which the
brothers and sisters of Leonidas had
contracted were unable to understand
why he couldn't earn money for the
support of six or seven as well as of
three or four. When the second gen
eration began to put In its appearance
it was up to Uncle Leonidas to see that
the deficits In the family exchequer
were met, as well as to provide the
requisite amount of silver spoons and
mugs and lace caps and other frills
and furbelows of infant existence.
But why continue this recital any
longer! It is a common tale of a very
common, not to say vulgar, person, and
can be of no possible interest to really
genteel persons. Leonidas stayed In
the game as long as possible and then
died quietly and unostentatiously. In

"Don't ask me, sir," I says. "I'd be

Well, I was telling Mr. Paul what
Kiddle told me of de teacher, and he
tells It to Whiskers to get a rise out

of the vagabond and the

people, Aleksey Maksim Pyesh

pep. name, "Maxim Gorki." "Gorki" is
the Russian word for bitter, and one
*** easily surmise the keynote of his
writings. "Gorki" was born thirty-five
years a^o in Nizhr.ee-Novgorod. the
capital of the province of the same

of Moscow, at the confluence of the

experienced all -sorts of struggles and
depravity and misery. . Shoemaker, ap
ple vendor, ikon painter, dockhand.
railroad guard, baker and tramp â these
.. are but some of the many occupations
of the unique man before he began to
write. During his txmmpbifi by th 2
Volga hp more than once attempted to
. take hi* own life. He recently attract
ed the widest attention upon being im
prisoned after the St. Petersburg riots
In the fortress of Petropavlovsk, but
his life was not in danger.
Under the guidance of Vladimir Ko
rolenko and Anton Chekhor Gorki be
rac to depict the life he knew bo well,
end within a very short time his Sto
ries took Russia by storm. - -Gorki at
once became the idol of the Russian
youth, and the workmen as well as the
peasants love him and read himâ end
those that cannot read themselves get
their more fortunate friends to read to
them his stories.
When a Nizhnee-Novgorod newspa
per printed some time ago a brief news
. item to the effect that Gorki's health
â was failing and that it was believed
he had consumption thousands of peas
ants from the remotest parts of the
empire sent him various herbs to cure
him of the white plague.
Gorki became the exponent of a new
school in Russian literature and among
his followers are almost all the gifted
younger Russian writers, such as An
drey Skitaletz. Bunia and Chlrlkbv.
Gorki has written two novels." "Foma
Gordeyer" and "The Three," and three
volumes of short stories. Several rev
olutionary articles and poems by him
were published in Germany. "The
Pees?.:.:." which promised to be on*
of his very best stork*, appeared in

remained unfinished. During the -last
four years Gorki has published : three
plays, but he has devoted most of 'his
time to the revolutionary movement..
Now that all eyes are centered on this
remarkable young Russian, it will, be
particularly interesting to have the
following most characteristic extracts

fessions of John Lee, Danite," with an
introduction by Alfred Henry Lewis,
the well known author. The period
covered is from 1537 to 1557.
According to Mr. Lewis' preface the
book is the authentic confession of
John Lee, written by the latter when
he was in prison waiting execution for
his participation in the historical out
rage known as the Mountain Meadows
massacre. Lee's confessions were pub
lished a few months after his death, but
were at once bought up by the Mor
mon church, and the plates destroyed.
The copy from which the present work
is republished was one of the few that
escaped destruction. Mr. Lewis frankly
states thai his motive in fathering the
book is three-ply: to withstand the
Mormon church as a political force;
tc limit its spread as a so-called re
ligion; and to buckler the mothers and
daughters of the church "against an
enemy whose advances are aimed es
pecially at them." Mr. Lewis wastes
no words in getting to the marrow of
his subject. The opening paragraph
to his introduction summarizes the
matter succinctly.
"Almost a half century ago, heir;? in
ÃB7, John Doyle Lee, a chief among
that red brotherhood, the Danites, was
ordered by Brigham Young and the
leading councilors of the Mormon
church to take his men and murder a
party of emigrants then on their way
throuch Utah to California. The Mor

jnon orders were to 'kill all who can
talk" and In their carrying out. Lee
ar.d his Danites, with certain Indians
they had recruited in the name of
scalps and pillage, slaughtered over one
hundred and twenty men, women and
children and left their stripped bodies
to the elements and the wolves. This
wholesale murder was given the title
of 'The Mountain Meadows Massacre.'
Twenty years later, in 1877, the belated
justice of this government seated Lea
on Ma cotYli. and shot him to death to*
his crimes."
It w-as during the long years fol
lowing his arrest and execution that
Lee wrote the story of his life, giving
among other matters the story of the
church of Mormons from its incep
tion to the time when he. Lee, was
executed for murders committed un
der the direction of the governing
powers of the church. It is the writ
ten word of a hard, calloused man,
singularly unimaginative, with a
streak of ignorance in his make-up
that rendered him an apt tool to the
slavish submission demanded by the
Mormon church. There is no evi
dence throughout the entire three
hundred and fifty pages of the "con
fession" of any shred of soul or
scrrple of conscience on the part of
Lee. He tells of his participation in
iniquities through his obedience to the
orders of hi* superiors with calm
dispassion. He makes no mention of
ever having been assailed by any men
tal doubt as to the right of his course.
He wag in all respects just of that
fanatical, ignorant, servile type which
permits itself to be molded into putty
by the hand of a master, and which
in other systems under absolute direc
torate would pull the trigger or throw
the bomb of the assassin and take the
results -with stoicism. According to
his own words, Lee proved himself a
faithful executioner w^hen the powers
ordered it. As one of Brigham
Young's Danites, or Avenging, Angels,
he was bound to put to death whom
soever he was ordered to.
Connecting this history of the early
Mormon church with the Mormon
church of to-day, Mr. Lewis says:
"In the old time the president of the
chiych was the temporal as well as the
spiritual head. No one might doubt
his "revelations' or dispute hi" com
mands without being visited with pun
ishment, which ran all the way from
a fine to the death penalty. When out
siders invaded their regions the Mor
mons, by command of Brisham Toune.
struck them down as in the Mountain
Meadows murders. This was In the
day when the arm of national power
was too short to reach them. Now.
when it can reach them, the church
conspires where before it assassinated
and strives to do by chioane what it
aforetime did by shedding blood. And
all to defend itself in .the practice of
polygamy! That Mormon conspir
acy, whereof Smoot in the Senate is
one expression (to become a political
power), was not made yesterday. It
had its birth in the year or the Ed
munds law and its drastic enforcement.
In that day, black for Mormons. It
was resolved to secure such foothold,
such representation in the Congress at
Washington, that, holding a balance
of power in the Senate or the House
or both, the Congressional Democrats
would grant the Mormons safety for
their pet tenet of polygamy as the price
of Mormon support." Mr. Lewis cites
the several well-known instances when
one man bald the deciding vote in the
Senaie.
It is a book frankly one-sided aeainst
Mormonicm and yet one which any
fair-minded person might read with
considerable profit.

Stewart
Has Rollicking' Wit
Â«T*|HF } craze for -. short stories has
rYiV. craze for short stories that
been so pronounced of late that
- many a writer of experience finds
it more profitable to devote .his, time
entirely, to short. stories; strung. out in
Arabian â â Kishts^fashion." ' Such' is > the
case *of : "The Fugitive," a', strong,"
"cleverly - written^ story by Charles iD.
Stewart -lie begins it by declaring that
the 'Fiherty; household, like-all Gaul,
was divided into r three parts, and then
and there â ? invites Â« one to '. step * in and
make a. visitation. The story; really is
a ; story within a story and the : double,
thread is handled ; In .a": cunning fash
ion. : i Finerty, of quaint and comfort
able philosophy, is only a railroad
hand, though at times he feels quite
like the president of the road -when
he dispenses hospitality in the sand
house to interesting and entertaining
tramp?, the chief of whom is Stumpy.
But most important of all is Bill,
"the fugitive- blacksmith." who can. as
Finerty says, "make annything out ay
annything." Bill certainly is a true
smith and is a real find in the world of
letters. Bill is always Bill, no mat
ter how trying the circumstances may
be. His vivid personality follows him
whether he Is running away from a
charge of murder, making a new leu
out of a carriage wheel spoke for
Stumpy, herding sheep and fighting the
loneliness that drives herders crazy,
or making a home for the wife that is
the apple of his eye.
All of Stewart's characters are
homely people, selected from the hard
working element, but none of them
lack tenderness and humor and the
wit that is guaranteed to cure a fit
of the blues and banish dull care.
Stewart himself has been an engraver
in Chicago for twelve years and dur
ing that time has not neglected an op
portunity to study human nature.
His family wanted him to be a clergy
man, but he objected and started out
in quest of adventures. He found
them and plenty of misadventures,
too. but it was this very thing that
turned his thought toward letters and
that gave him the ability and power
to write with truth and vitality.

THoughts"

CONCEIVED in a spirit of distort
ed, misdirected iconoclasm is the
"Thoughts of a Fool," written by
Evelyn Gladys. In much of its
twaddle It is strongly reminiscent
of the "essays" of Gelett Burgess, a
vain, labored attempt to Invest super
ficiality with substance. Occasionally,
when the high pressure tension for
epigram and aphorism is relaxed, a
chapter is produced that is worthy of
reflection, but it happens so rarely that
the work as a whole suffers the tone
of the baser half. Yet it is to be re
gretted that this writer, apparently
well able by Intelligence to do good
work in this line, should not have de
voted her energies. If it Is a her, to
ward such saner satirical, if bitter,
flights, as the chapter entitled "Ostra-
cized." It is the one chapter in the
book that does not lose itself in the
maze of its own vague and shadowy
grasping at vague and shadowy con
cepts.
There is a chapter on "Free Love,"
which starts out well and then shoots
off at a tangent and leaves the ques
tion in the air. Beginning with the
temper of an Ironical questioner, it
concludes with the attitude of a con
fuser, to no special advantage, as the
reader is- not sufficiently impressed
with the logic to attempt to carry the
argument through in his own mind, if
indeed he were able.
As one example of the somewhat nar
row, and limited depth, of the writer's
argument when anxious to point an es
pecially pertinent and "fresh" view
point, the following may be given. It
is taken from a chapter entitled "What
Can You Expect," wherein the author
endeavors to convince that the tend
ency .jf life times is socialism, an
archisni, trade-unionism ar.d the like
are due to the false standard of ideaia
held up before the younger genera
tion. Examples are given, such as
Moses and Jesus and historical figures
such as Cromwell and John Brown,
and the flaw in the ideal show vp â ac
cording to the iconoclasm of this writ
er. Washington is taken up and then
follows this paragraph:
"Can we afford to parade our na
tional heroes as examples to our work
ing classes? Do we not already see
the insurgency that such ideals as
Washington had instilled in the breasts
of our humble classes? George Wash
ington is our great national hero. But
suppose we were to rehearse his his-
Tory in brief, onSittingr, his name and
the glamour that we associate with It,
what would ;we^tbink of such a man
to-day? Given a. commission in his
Britannic Majesty's /colonial army, he
defaulted allegiance to his : King over
so sordid a trifle as stamp. duties. He
became commander-in-chief . of/ an
army that was in rebellion against the
crown under 'which." he"; had been, ex
alted. His triumph "consisted in 'â  dis
obedience to law, and he became the
father of his country, much revered by
school children on February 22, when
that 'date nbt fall on Sunday.'and
on July 4. when it does not rain.
With such Ideals there is no wonder
that some Americans follow his Ideals.
The life of Washington was one of
disobedience and .treason to his Kinsj.
The very act of gathering his army
was treason. - His triumph was by
breaking the law."
This is high argument. This facile
phrasemaker_ would set up the dogma
that all laws must be bowed to. gco<l,
bad or indifferent, whether Draconian,
Siberian or tyrannical as the laws of
George the . Truly this thing of
yaun.g writers pelting at pyramids in
order to say something pert to get
them the sooner into the public aye
with the apparently desirable sobriquet
of "clever" becomes overdone at times,
as. in these "thoughts:"

OWEN JOHNSON, author of "Ar
rows of the Almighty," which
enjoyed some popularity, lias
written another book, taking for his
theater of action the old familiar Paris
during the old familiar Revolution. The
citizen and the citizeness, the aristo
crat and the Bastile, the Carmagnole
and the Tuileries, are all here once
again, in the usual blend. The great
difficulty in an author whose powers
are unquestionably not of the great
est. In taking up a theme of this char
acter is that a man named Dickens
once wrote a book called "The Tale of
Two Cities'* in which thi3 theater of
action was exploited in a, manner so
graphic, so pregnant : with human ac
" tion and passion, so live with under
standing of the heart of the mad,
many-headed Parisian, mob, that it
â¢ leaves the ambitious neophyte a tre
mendausiy difficult field, yin which to
stir up interest anew.
. j However, Mr. Johnson has probably
not intended to be hung up on the wall
for Inspection alongside of Dickons.
and is probably content that his little
novel fulfills', as indeed it does, the
place-ever open, for a heart story, al
though It ends, as this one ends, with
one young life Â«nuff edÂ«*ctrt by the blade
-of the . guillotine. ', . ' '
On the eve ,of revolution, in :1732,: 1732, one
Barabant finds himself in Paris. He
encounters one Nicole, a flower ; girl,
who straightway. falls in love with him,
but for a considerable space denies her
love even to herself. The revolution
breaks out. In the somewhat custom
ary fashion both Barabant and Nicole,
although active partisans of the re
public, â¢ are. by the machinations of
certain evil wishers, thrown into prison
to wait their ride in the tumbrils to
the guillotine. The fatal day ap
proaches when they are to go forth.
But Barabant is ahead of Nicole on
the list. Whereupon Nicole, by art and
bribery, , prevails upon one Cramoisin.
in charge of the. death list, to exchange
her name with her lover's. Then, with
- the assistance of an abbe, who is also
â¢ awaiting his .*â  turn, they are wedded,
with Barabant ignorant of the sacri
fice she has made. Her name la called
and she goes out and meets the death
in his place, happy in t:.at she dies as
his wife. Before his turn comes, Robes
pierre has fallen and the Reign of Ter
ror is at an end. In the epilogue is
disclosed Barabant. many years later,
full of riches and titles and honors,
high in the graces of the Emperor. To
a party c-f gay friends he is made to
say: "Dame, yes! ' Will you believe it
of me? At twenty- five I wept because
I could not die for an idea!" So light
ly did Nicole rest upon him.
On ; the whole it is a pretty little
work, without any pretension to great
ness. . The character of Nicole is the
best thing *in it. and next to it. the
character of Dt/ssonville. For those to
whom the crash of the guillotine and
the massacres of the. Reign of Terror
can still awaken interest, the book
should prove a pastime.

"A Short History of Oregon. " com
piled by Sidona V. Johnson, is a small
volume which in view of the corning
Lewis and Clark exposition appears a:
a timely period. It is toU in an easy
flowing narrative style, without undue
enlargement upon any one period or
circumstance, and is rather a running
commentary upon the Ustory of our
northern neighbor from the first dis
coveries of her coast line by Bartoleme
Ferrelo In March of 1543 to the present
time. There are six general subdivi
â  sions: discovery, ' exploration, settle
ment, government, . Indian . wars and
progress. 1 Â£Â£Â£Â£Â§999*
The chapter on discovery gives the
layman whose history and geography
have grown somewhat rusty a com
prehensive' bird3eye view of the early
navigators to whose intrepid hardihood
was. due .the opening up of the Pacific
Coast line, dwelling especially upon
the - search .' for ' the Northwest passage
and the early inland explorations of the
Hudson Bay Company.
, The section on exploration deals with
the Lewis and Clark 1 * expedition sent
out by President Jefferson shortly after
the date of the Louisiana Purchase to
follow up the Missouri and penetrate
to the Pacific Coast by way of the Co
lumbia, exploring the. great northwest
territory which the latter drained. The
expedition set forth from St. Louis on -
May 14. 1804. arriving there again upon
September . 25. IMC, marking, In the
words of President Roosevelt, "the be
ginning of the process of exploration
and colonization which thrust our na
tional boundary to the . Pacific. The
acquisition of the Oregon country, in
cluding the present States of Oregon
and Washington, was a fact of im

Chandos House is a relic of the vast
scheme projected by the Duke of
c'handos In 1815. He intended to build
a magnificent mansion on the north
Fide of the square, and to buy all the
land between that and Canons, his
place near Edgeware. In order that he
might ride into London, a distance of
nine miles, on his own property. Real
estate in the metropolis has so vastly
increased in price since then that the
accomplishment of such a project
would probably be now beyond the
â¢wealth of even the richest American
multi-millionaires. However, the Col
gate money will be quite equal to mak
ing Chandos House one of the most
luxurious private residences in London.
It will be odd if before long society
does not hear that Miss Colgate has
made a brilliant match. The demand
tor American heiresses is as great as
ever in the matrimonial market.

PICTURESQUE
SPOT YIELDS
TO PROGRESS
Noted Milk Fair
of London Now
of the Past
LOXDOX, March 4.â The plucky ef
fort made by two old women to retain
a right granted their ancestors 300
y-ais ago, though carried out in defi
ance of "progress." has won the sym
pathy of all London, and while it last
ed aroused more interest than even the
mission of the American evangelists
the conversion of the rich in the
Wp=t End.
Few American visitors to London
have returned home without seeing the
antique stalls in St. James Park, at
which two old women sold milk, buns,
candy and other simple refreshments.
A pair of sleek Jer?ey cows tethered
â  y attested to the purity of the
lacteal beverage dispensed. The mem
ory of man runs not back to the time
when the stalls have not been there
with the cakes and lollypopp, two cows
and women in attendance. A picture
â  .k â  IforUuid and not
highly prized shows that the bucks and
belles who promenaded in the Mall a
hundred years ago did not disdain to
â â¢ iheir patronage on the "Milk
Fair." as the little booths were called.
Presenting a striking contrast to- the
luxurious growth of the modern Baby
lon round about, it has served as a
;ng reminder of the long ago times
when St. James Park and the West
belonged to rural London. The
old-fashioned milk stalls and their
quaint attendant dames constituted a
jil^asant anachronism in the rather
drab and colorless life of the vast hu
man beehive. They helped the mind to
reflection and they were historical and
traditional. But ruthless and auto
cratic authority has now swept the
whole phow into the dustbin of the
pÂ«St to clear the way for the march of
modern improvements.
For nearly 300 years the same family
held the right of selling milk in the
Mall. It was granted by King James
I 1n 1623.
Two previous attempts were made by
the potent office of works to clear them
out. The first was in 1885. No press
ing necessity could be pleaded in be
half of summary ejectment then, and
the press and public opinion rallied in
support of the milkstalls. Queen Vic
toria finally intervened in behalf of
the two women, allowing it to be
known, unofficially, of course, that it
was her desire that they should be al
lowed to remain, and that settled the
matter as long as she lived. In 1901 a
half-hearted attempt was made to
scare them off, but It went no further
than the service of a notice which they
complacently disregarded.

SPECIAL FROCK FOR "BRIDGE,"
THE VERY LATEST IN LONDON
Designed to Permit of the Greatest
Comfort While Playing.
LONDON, March 4.â lt was inevita
ble and it has arrivedâ the "bridge"
frock. In smart femininity a new di
version is always held to be a sufficient
excuse for a toilette to match it. The
woman who has been smitten with the
popular craze declares that there is a
psychological importance attached to
the garment she wears when she gam
bles. If it isn't the acme of comfort it
is apt to put her off her play, especially
when luck is running against her.
That part of It which demands spe
cial attention is the sleeve. Frills of
chiffon that get mixed up with the soup
at dinner parties may be endured, but
they will spoil the most angelic tem
per when they interfere with the deal
ing of cards or the picking up of tricks.
Therefore the essence of suitability for
the bridge frock is that the sleeve
should finish at the elbow or there
abouts. If there should happen to be
an unbecoming- angularity in that par
ticular part of the human anatomy it
may be disguised by a small cascade of
falling lace or a frill that goes a little
below the joint. If nature calls for fur
ther concealment mittens of suitable
length may be worn. For the rest, the
bodice should be guileless of bones and
the waistband should admit of plenty
of breathing space. Under the strain
of continuous playing a cool head can
not be maintained when tight lacing is
indulged in. An artificially produced
slim waist is responsible for many a
trick being lost.
Thus It would seem the law of com
pensation is again vindicated, and as a
foe to tight lacing . the bridge frock
should be welcomed by feminine re
formers. Meanwhile the advent of the
bridge frock is not without significance
as indicating the response which the
West End is making to the mission of
the American evangelists for thÂ» con
version of the rich.
CEREMONY IT IS SAID WILL COST -
FULLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
TROUSSEAU WORTH A FORTUNE
Notables From All Courts of the World Will Be
Present as the Emperor's Guests.
BERLIN, March 4. â It is going to
cost Germany over half a million dol
lars to get her future Emperor mar
ried, but in return for their money
the folk of the fatherland will have
a show of pomp and ceremony such as
seldom has been seen in modern Eu
rope. In the preparations for his eld
est son's wedding to the Duchess Ce
cilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which
is now set for Monday, May 22, the
Kaiser is giving full reign to his love
of imperial splendor and display.
On the marriage ceremony itself,
which will take place in the magnifi
cent new cathedral in Berlin in the
presence of an exalted company
whose like never has gathered under
one roof, $50,000 will be spent. The
presents which will be given to the
young couple by municipalities and
public corporations will amount to a.
total of at least $250,000, while a simi
lar sum is being spent on the bride's
trousseau. On her wedding day the
Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-
Schwerln will be almost 19 years of
age, while her young husband will
have attained the age of 23.
TO TRAVEL IX STATE.
No part of the elaborate ceremonial
In connection with her wedding will
be more impressive than the Duchess
Cecilie's journey from her home in
Schwerin to Berlin, which will take
place a few days before her marriage.
From the palace of her brother, the
Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
with whom she has lived up to now,
to the Schwerin railway station the
Duchess will be escorted by the Grand
Duke himself, by the Ministers of
state of the grand duchy, by the high
officers of the garrison at Schwerin
and by a deputation of noblemen and
noblewomen representing the leading
families of Mecklenburg aristocracy.
Surrounded by a magnificent com
pany, Duchess Cecilie will drive in an
open carriage from her home to the
railway station, where a special train
will be waiting to convey her to Ber
lin. This train will consist of cars
painted in blue and gold. The loco
motive will be gayly decorated with
flowers and a wreath of myrtle will be
hung around the stack.
The Grand Duke and the Grand
Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin as
well as a magnificent suite consisting
of over fifty persons will escort Duch
ess Cecilie to Berlin, a journey of about
three hours. A guard of honor will be
drawn up on the platform of the sta
tion at Schwerin and at the moment
the train begins to glide away on its
journey these troops will present arms,
a roll will be beaten on the drums and
a blast of trumpets will proclaim the
departure of the Crown Prince's bride.
At the same moment the guns of the
fortress of Schwerin will boom out a
salute of thirty-threÂ© guns, and there
â¢will be cheers from the children of the

public schools of the little capital,
drawn up on the platform.
ARRIVAL AT BERLIN.
The arrival at Berlin will be a still
more impressive affair. Or. the plat
form the German Emperor, the Crown
Prince, the five younger sons of the
Kaiser, the Emperor's brother, Prince
Henry, and four other royal princes of
the Hohenzollern family will be wait
ing to greet Duchess Cecilie. The
moment the train slops the bride-elect
will descend the steps of the saloon car
and will be embraced and kissed first
by the Emperor and then by the Crown
Prince, who probably will secretly re
sent the rigid rules of court etiquette
which gives this imperial father the
right of jlrecedenee on this occasion.
Duchess Cecilie will then shake hands
with the other royal princes while the
usual military honors are being paid
to her. The royal party will then enter
open carriages to drive to the Imperial
castle situated in the heart of the city
of Berlin. The Emperor and the
Duchess Cecilie will ride side by side
in the first carriage, the Crown Prince
sitting opposite to them with his back
to the coachman. The other royal
princes and the various suites will fol
low in other carriages, of which there
will be about thirty in the procession.
The state carriages conveying the
Emperor, Crown Prince and Duchess
Cecilie will be drawn by six white
horses and will be preceded and fol
lowed by a squadrc-n of cavalry guards
as an escort. The streets through
which the procession of the carriages
will pass will be lined with spectators
who will accord their future Empress
a warm popular reception. The Ger
man Empress will be waiting on the
threshold pt the imperial castle, where
she will embrace and kiss her future
daughter-in-law.
Duchess Cecilie will remain in her
residence at the imperial castle, but
the Crown Prince will continue to re
side in the palace at Potsdam, coming
into Berlin each morning by train and
returning each evening, for etiquette
provides that he shall not sleep under
the same roof as his bride during tha
few nights preceding the wedding. The
last day or two will be fully occupied
with the completion of all the neces
sary arrangements.
SCORE OF MONARCHS.
The wedding ceremony will be sol
emnized in the new cathedral which
the German Emperor has erected on
the open space in front of the impe
rial castle in Berlin. The distance
from the imperial castle to the cathe
dral is only two or three hundred
yards and the wedding party will pass
from one building to the other on foot.
The Crown Prince will wear the
uniform of the First Regiment of
Guards, consisting of a long blue coat,
blue trousers and gaiters extending to
the knees. He will wear a helmet
with white plumes and his breast will
be decorated with tho ribbons of
all the exalted orders to which he be
longs.
After the Crown Prlnc* has taken
up his stand in the cathedral in front
of the altar the German Emperor will
leave the imperial castle, accompanied
by the Empress, the other members
of the Prussian royal family and all
the royal guests, who will be present
as representatives of the reigning
families of Europe. These will in
clude the King of Spain; the Czar' 3
brother. Grand Duke Michael of Rus
sia: the successor to the Austrian
throne. Archduke Francis Ferdi"

and the Prince of Wales, representing
England. Including the rulers of the
smaller German states, there will be
twenty reigning monarchs and thirty
royal Princes and Princesses, making
a total of over fifty royal personages
present at the wedding. These royal
ties, with their suites of gorgeously
uniformed officers, will form a com
pany of unprecedented brilliancy.
EXPENSIVE WEDDING DRESS. .
After the members of this party have
entered the cathedral and have taJcen
their allotted seats the bride will leave
the Imperial castle to proceed to the
ceremony. She will wear a white
dress adorned wtth the costliest lace,
for which her dressmaker will receive
a check for $25,uOQ; a long white veil
and a small wreath of myrtle on her
head.
The ceremony will last rather morÂ«
than half an hour and as soon as it is
concluded the organ will strike up a
wedding march, while the guns of the
forts around Berlin will flre a salute of
101 guns.
A magnificent state banquet will be
given In the imperial castle, at which
covers will be laid for five hundred
guests. The Crown Prince and the
Crown Princess will sit side by side
at one end of the central table, with
the Emperor and the Empress oppo

drill that was most creditable to them
and won much applause. Then fol
lowed the ball, which kept the lovers
of dancing together until "Home,
Sweet Home" was played at midnight.
The success of this affair was due in
a great measure to the committee, of
which Miss Mabel Williams was the
very active chairman. It was a very
pleasant function and very creditable
to the team.
National Union.
The open meeting and "rough-house
banquet" of El Capitan Council of the
National last week was a great suc
cess as to the point of number in at
tendance, excellence of attendance and
hospitality at the banquet. President
McCabe waa the managing director for
the evening and under his supervision
Speaker Barlow called upon Fred
Purdy for ballads, Izzy Myers for 'dia
lect stories, specialties by M. Beres
ford, instrumental music by Klein (the
one-man orchestra), mandolin and gui
tar selections by Walter Clarkson and
his students, and stories by President
McCabe. Then followed the banquet,
at which were served tamales (extra
hot), enchiladas, baked beans, beer,
coffee and hot rolls. Then there was a
display of parlor fireworks, followed by
oratorical pyrotechnics by "Prince"
Laurance Vincent, General Deputy
Joseph A. Wilson, E. C. Stock of Cali
fornia Council, and specialties by the
Clarkson students, Izzy Myers and
President McCabe. Several applica
tions from strangers wishing to be
come members of El Capitan were pre
sented.
The extension of the order commit
tee of the local councils of the National
Union held a meeting last week and
completed arrangements for the pur
pose of, giving Leo Canman of Chicago,
chief of the finance committee of the
Senate of the order, a reception on his
visit to this city and to enter
tain him while here. The visitor la
known as "the Prince Bismarck" of the
National Union.
Last week El Dorado Council initi
ated one stranger and received six ap
plications.
During the past two weeks General
Deputy Joseph A. Wilson has received
from ten to fifteen letters a day from
members of the order suggesting the
names of persons who are eligible.
The event of the past week in this
city in National Union circles was the
arrival of Leo Canman, a member of
the Senate of the National Union, chair
man for many years of the finance com
mittee of that body, president for four
teen years of Press Council of Chicago,
ex-president of the Chicago Press Club
and railroad editor of the Chicago

his arrival here he was met toy General
Deputy Joseph A. Wilson, Senators
Field, Arter, ex-Senator Maass and
other prominent members of the order.
Last Tuesday he was tho guest of Gol
den Gate Council, which tendered him
a public reception. There was a very
large attendance, including many
strangers. He was given a first class
National Union welcome and under
good for the order there was. under
direction of Speaker Lloyd C. Comegys,
music by the council quartet, short
addresses by the general deputy, ex-
Senator Maass, Senator Field, Presi
dent Thompson of the council and ex-
President of the Cabinet W. A. S.
Nicholson, after which the chairman of
the finance committee, who is known
in the order as the Bismarck of the
National Union, spoke at some length.
He expressed his gratification at the
reception he had met in this city and
said that the National Union men are
more generous *in their treatment of
visitors here than are those of the East.
He stated that he had been in Los
Angeles for three weeks and that he
proposes to remain here for several
weeks, during- which time he will study
National Union affairs in the State, and
that on his return to tbe head office hÂ»
will make recemmondations for the ad
vancement of the order in this juris
diction. He paid a high compliment to
General Deputy Wilson for his work
and zeal. After his speech there was
an adjournment to the banquet hall,
where a fine supper was discussed,
after which Lew Parent entertained
with comic songs, and J. H. Baker, re
cording secretary of Golden Gate, Gen
eral Deputy Wilson and Ernest G
Stock of California Council spoke for
the good of the order. On the following
night the visitor was with California
Council, when he was given an oppor
tunity of seeing how that council initi
ates candidates. It was a revelation to
him and he said so. He was then ex
tended the hospitality of the council,
which was not behind that of Golden
Gate, and he made an interesting ad
dress.
Knights and Ladies.
Grand Protectress Frances J. Wil
liams oaid a visit recently to Star
Lodge In Sonora. It was the first visit
that the lodge has received from a
grand protector in fourteen years, and
the arrival of the visitor was made the
occasion of a grand fraternal jollifica
tion. She was met at her distination
by a committee of the lodge, escorted
to the leading hotel and shown many
courtesies until it was time to attend
the meeting. Nearly all of the fifty
eight members of the lodge \veÂ»e pres
ent and gave her a rousing welcome.
Then came the business methods and
exemplification of the work, which
phowed that the members of the lodge
are not behind the others in that par
ticular. After the close of the lodge
there was a banquet, which demon
strated that members of the lodges in
the interior are, as a rule, more lavish
in their hospitality than many in the
city lodges. Mrs. E. T. Parker was the
toastmistress. In addition to the
supper there were speeches until an
early hour in the morning.
The grand protectress visited the
membership in Auburn and in Sacra
mento last week.
At the second meeting in February of
Aurora Lodge No. 202 there was Avork
in the initiatory degree by the new
officers for the first time since installa
tion a month previous. For a first
effort in that line Protector Min
nie Luton and the other officers who
had speaking parts in the work did re
markably well and^ were accorded a
meed of praise at the close of the cere
mony. The lodge also admitted one
member by card. The recently install
ed protector is bending her efforts to
make this lodge not only a working
protective one, but a first-class social
one.

able supper the following were called
upon to respond to toasts: Sir Knights
Krause, Bohee, Carlson, Marks, Al

"moons."
A new tent of the Maccabees waa
recently instituted by Great Com

and silver spoon to the installing of
ficer as a souvenir of the occasion;
then there was presented to Lady
Hedges a valuable silver berry spoon
in token of appreciation of her ser
vices as record keeper for seven years,
which position she left to become the
presiding officer. Lady Herring, the
retiring commander of California Hhre,
was presented a token of fraternal
love as a member and of admiration
as an officer. Lady Jacob, retiring
commander of Mission Hive, was pre
sented an elegant cut glass berry dish.

ant party in the Electrical Engineers'
Hall on the evening of the third Thurs
day in February. Many of the mem
bers of the camp and of those of Good

The Forester team of Goodfellow
ship Camp of the Modern Woodmen of
America gave an entertainment and
dance in the Electrical Engineer's Hall
recently that was well attended and
was very entertaining.
Occidental Camp has arranged an
entertainment for the purpose of se
curing a fund with which to procure
uniforms for its team. This camp is
doing well, initiation being held at al
most every meeting.
Dr. Peck of Occidental Camp has an
nounced himself as a candidate for the
office of head physician at the next
Head Camp session.
State Deputy J. O. Davis paid an
official vis.lt to. the camp at Clovis last
week and then he visited the one at

Some time since the Head Camp issued
an appeal to the entire membership to
make a donation for the assistance of
Charles M. Schulsleer of Los Angeles,
the member of the order who had to
be patched up by the skin grafting pro
cess with pieces of epidermis contrib
uted by more than two hundred mem
bers of the order. In response to this
more than ?4000 has already been con

Grand Third Vice President Judge M.
T. Dooling? has completed his official
visits to the parlor* in the district
assigned to him. He reports having
encountered two severe snowstorms
in the mountains, but that these did
not dampen the ardor of the members
of the parlors he visited. While visit
ins at Oak Park, a large delegation of
Natives from Sacramento visited the
parlor there, to welcome the one who
is in line for the presidency of the
order. The members of the parlor, as
well as the visitors, were delighted
with the candor and the eloquence of
the grand officer.
Grand Organiser Andrew Mocker has
proved himself one of the most re
markable organizers that has ever
been put in the field, not only for the
number of parlors he has organize
and has instituted, but for the care
he has taken in placing in old and new
parlors only such as are a credit to
the order.

Men's Institute in Native Sons' Hall
on the night of the third Thursday in

ment weather, well attended and was
a delightful function. The decora

artistic in arrangement. There were
many couples in the grand march,
which terminated In a wait*. Then
followed eleven numbers. Including
lancers, schottlshe and, two-atep. The

circles, had the hall decorated in
Oriental style, red being the color
scheme, while In the center trt thÂ«

knew of Miss Rita Newman when . I
went to see her the other day was that

years ago before she left with the
Scheel Symphony Orchestra, and at the
ever-to-be remembered Carr-Beel

It is amusing, but unsafe to guess
r.hat people can do by what they say.
It is a hazard, perhaps, still more en
teruuning and still mcc chanceful to
j Icture what they will say by what
they do. I know an artist here who
talks like Michael Angelo and paints
likeâ well, that is another story. It
jsvas a modest, unassuming; brown-eyed
\ oung woman that met me the other
afternoon at the St. Francis at my re
quest for "Miss Newman."
Iv. referred to the "parlor" â hate
ful word", and why are hotel drawing
r'>orr.s always thus stigmatized? Still,
to the- hopeless, immaculate, green and
gold handsomeness of the room the
verd stuck closer than a brother. I
sighed as 1 sat down, and Miss New
r.ian, as she came in, took the edge of
another chair and I knew we were in
for a talk to match the room.
1 sail Miss Newman must be glad to
come home under such charming aus
pices? She said she was. 1 told her we
had been having- delightful weather for
more than a .week. She hoped that it
would continue. I remarked luminous
ly that San Francisco must have
frown enormously during Miss New
man's absence? She replied with meas
ured enthusiasm that it had. 1 in
formed her that we had just had an
i-dinary season cf grand opera at
the Tlvoli. Miss New'man politely had
heard so. And then I yelled: 'Isn't
tht-re a convenient garret somewhere?"
The singer jumped to her feet, laid a
relieved hand on my arm, and on the
way to the elevator said she didn't
mind if I didn't, but the maid had not
"made up" her room yet. And up, up,
we went, to where, under her window,
Snn Francisco stretched her great Jew
eled lengths in the sun. We fitted our
selves before it into a couple of cozy
rockers and then began to talk.
We had just begun when a knock
sounded on the door â about at the top
of it â and to Miss Newman's "Come
in." entered a very tall and bass person
who was introduced to me as Mi.
Bennett." and whom I then recognized
as the Ludovico of the^ "Otheilo" of
the evening before. Mr" Bennett had
come to ask Miss Newman to permit
him to leave a valise with her. He did
not like the hotel where he was stay
ing and was poing to migrate to the
Et. Francis. And then, somehow, Mr.
Bennett settled down into the inter
view just as If he belonged there.
Apain I did not mind if Miss Newman
did not, and she rather seemed to like
it. Indeed, I should not wonder If she
had Invited the giant basso to defend
hÂ°r from the terrible interviewer!
. Miss Newman rocked quietly as she
told of being a pupil of Mme. Julie
Rosewald here, of going to Europe
and dropping immediately into a

Hamburg, where for a year and a half

debut being made as Rosina in "11

"And just about that time," the
Finger recounted, "I sang for â whom
do you think? Keinrich Conried,
and h<? made me an offer to sing col
oratura soprano roles at Irving Place
Theater *'
"And now?" I asked.
"Not just yet," said the quiet young
woman before me, and I could not
make out if it were in modesty or con
fidence.
â¢ "But you had an appointment to
F:r.g Cor Mr. Conried not long ago and
did not keep it," Mr. Bennett
prompted.
She reminded him and explained to
me that her voice was not then in
good trim, but she "hoped some
day â "
"I suppose all Mr. Savage's people
"hope some day?' "
"We do rather consider ourselres as
in a kind of school," Mr. Bennett put
It. "We are all pretty young singers,
the oldest between SB and 40. and hop
ing some day to graduate into farther
distinctions."

Newman told me, that she first discov
ered that she was not a coloratura so

years, to her further two years with
Duvanoy at the Paris Conservatoire,
and to a season cf dramatic training
with Mme. Weinschenk â to whom she
â hopes to return this summer â Miss
Newman gratefully acknowledges her
indebtedness.
You missed Marchesi? " I suggested.
"No, I didn't," Miss Newman contra
dicted In her firm little way, "I had a
month, and that was enough."
"How can you <i>e so profane!" I
protested.
"I should not have had that," Miss
Newman calmly continued, "only I
had paid the month in advance."
How did the Tivoli season come up
then? It did, however, and Mr. Ben
nett and Miss Newman confessed to
having arrived in town on Sunday
night at 10 o'clock and to taking in the
comet-like tail of the Tivoli season.
Miss Newman, San Francisco-born,

hi Xew Orleans. They both explained
then that it was a very properly fright
ened and humble company that made
its bow to us here last Monday night!
They both remarked further that it
was particularly here that they were
confident of praise for good work.
"How do you explain the New Or

stronghold of French opera, would
none of Mr. Savage's company.
They could not explain, but retold
of the general condemnatory attitude
of the r>res?s and people.
"They said the less said about me
the better," Mr. Bennett naively re
counted, and Miss Newman preserved
a speaking silence.
"You were pleased with your re
hi here?"' I inquired â "I think in
a less exacting opera than 'Othello'
it would have been more enthusias-
Mr. Savage haa something of a
superstition about 'Othello,' the sing
ers explained; "he rather believes
it iÂ« the best thing we do." And how
rerjr much Mr. Savage counts, to the
last detail of the productions, his
singers admirably recounted. "But I
think we are all pleased with our re
ception on the whole." they added, in
a contralto and basso duet. "It was
maybe better than we hoped for, and
perhaps â perhaps you will be better
pleased with us later. We are going
to be very proud if you are.
I bowed, for us.
Asking for a little of the Bennett
history I learned that the basso was
Boston-born and for four years a
pupil of Cologni of Rome, who taught
Jean de Reszke for five years. We
had a little incident of Caruso that
was interesting.
"1 h:v' Caruso's old room in Rome,"
Mr. Bennett told me, in a boyish, hap
py fashion that sits rath> r unexpect
edly on hi? six feet four or so. "And in
the room there was a set of antlers.
Caruso had not won fame then, though
he was getting to be known. Anyway
he was singing in 'Adrienne Lecou
vreur," and the night before he sang
it f<>r the first time he came to my
room to ask permission to rub his
throai on the antlers!'!
"Did you rub yours?" I asked, but
Mr. Bennett declined to say.
He said instead: "My landlady â I
suppose I shouldn't tell this â told me
that Caruso had made such an unholy
muss of the room that he had ruined
it. She wrote to tHI him so when he
became famous and he sent her the
handsomest set of furniture that
money could buy!"
And is the Caruso voice all it is
painted?"
"Ooh!" Miss Newman sighed, and
turned up her clear brown eyes exactly
as every woman to whom I have hinted
"Caruso" has done.
And "Ooh!" too, said Mr. Bennett.
"Blass will be here, too, won't he?"
Miss Newman laughed. "I sang
Suzanne to his Figaro, in The Mar
riage of Figaro,' in my lyric soprano
days. What a clumsy pair we were!"
It was Mr. Bennett that suggested
"tea," Miss Newman that added "muf
fins," and over them downstairs they
talked of the Galleria, the famous

"No, it costs too much," the singer

SAVAGE'S COMPANY
OFFERS NOVELTIES
IN AND OPERA
In the matter of repertoire the Sav
age English Opera Company is partic
ularly fortunate. This week will be
given two more novelties of the season
in "Tannhauser" and 'II Trovatore,"
with "La Boheme" as the third opera.
It is said that the Company is partic
ularly hapi'y in its "La Boheme,'' in
which Miss Reta Newman will be the
Mimi and Mr. Roberts the Rudolfo. Mr.
Wegener's Tannha.user promises to be
a distinguished performance. Mr. Shee
han, who has quite recovered from his
indisposition, will be the Manrico of
"II Trovatore."
"Rosmersholm," that was to have
been given at a special matinee at the
Majestic Theater next Wednesday
afternoon, will be postponed until the
A NEW PHASE OF DECORATIVE ART PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA
Have you seen that decorative leath
er exhibition at Paul Klder's? Then,
haste thoe, else you'll miss something,
for a week hence the wondrous things
will have gone southâ to be shown at
Mrs. Robert Burdette's at Pasadena.
The artists who have wrought such
exquisite things from the commonplace
hide of a bawling calfâ the most un
poetic thing in natureâ are Walter H.
Pritchard and Jose V. Giles, two in
teresting chap*, deadly in earnest in
th^ir new place of art â one an Irish
man and the other Cornish; and they
surely have attained worthy things,
these fellows in Arts and Crafts.
By method of chemical treatment, the
leather assumes a transparency that
gives to it an appearance of pulsating,
throbbing life. And when stretched
over light, the color is magical, the
reds and yellows looking like live fire
flaming from Mont Pelee.
The work they present tells largely
of the depths of the sea â its mystical
caverns, its swaying seaweed and its
glistening, gliding, glinting denizens.
Here is an unusual conception. Nor
Is tt, in fact, wholly a conception of
the imagination â of which, by the way,
this Irishman Pritchard possesses an
abundanceâ but largely the result of
years of delving into the silent mys
teries of the sea. And calming is the
following Wednesday. It will then
be produced for the second time only
in America, the rirst production being
put on in New York some time last
season. The play is one of the most
weirdly characteristic works of Ibsen,
and the presentation will doubtless at
tract the extraordinary attention it de
serves. "Mizpah" will be the regular
bill and will be seen this week for
positively the last time.
The reappearance of Kolb and Dill
this? afternoon at the Grand Opera
house will doubtless be the signal for
an overflowing house. The Jolly Dutch
men have more friends here than they
could count in a week and they will all
be there. It if unimportant, but cus
tomary to mention that the comedians
will appear in "I O U." Judson Brusie's
burlesque, in which they had so
much success at Fischer's.
The Alcazar will give this week for
the first time in stock Henry Arthur
Jones' powerful Socialistic play, "The
Middleman," in which E. S. Willard
won one of the largest sur'tvsses of
his career. The drama should afford
excellent opportunity to the Alcazar
players. Mr. John Craig and Miss Lil

chief roles.

Then there is the decorative work
for pillows, portieres and personal
trappings, such as the girdle worn by
the divine Sarah.
Among the decorative pieces is a re
markable bit of work done after the
McKinley, as headliner this week in her
new song, v "Karama," and others of the
soprano repertoire. Piwitt and his
"mysterious face" will continue to be a
leading novelty.
Mr. John T. Chick and his company
will illumine the Chutes this week with
the comedietta "Over the Garden
Wall."
Fischer's will have a star attraction
this week in Madame Slapoffski, the
Australian soprano that made such a
sensation at the Orpheum last season.
MUSICIANS
AND MUSICAL
HAPPENINGS
Some one should have told Signorina
Tetrazzini last Sunday afternoon that
it was Signor Polacco'* symphony con
cert and not a Tetrazzini pink tea^hat
was going on at the Tivoli. The singer
seemed to be a little in error in the
matter. The affair apparently pre
sented itself to the lady as a sort of
tea fight with Tetrazzini as the lady
lien. Doubtless we have spoiled her.
Doubtless there were a good many
folk â we are still in part sufficiently
artless â who regarded her singing of
the "Mignon" "Polonaise" as the
chief event of the afternoon, with
poor Mr. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
a.s a bad second. But the singer
should have known better.
Pardonable enough it may have been
for her to sit in a box before her solo,
waving greetings all over the house. It
was less decorous for her to return to
it and still less courteous for her to
create further applausive commotion
famous painting in the National Gal
lery in London, "The Battle of San
Egidio." And not less valuable as
decorative art, but infinitely less deli
cate in the minuteness of detail, in the
pillow cover, or panel, of King Harold,
an old allegory. This is the boldest,
strongest bit of work In the exhibit,
albeit less fascinating to me than the
subtle, suggestive sea-sights.
But see them all, subtle and ob
vious â for they represent an absolute

ifornia triumph, since almost all of
the distinctive work has been done
under our turquoise skies.

One of the most interesting chaps
among the San Francisco coterie of
artists is a newcomer, Eugen Neu
haus, a fellow who knows a few things
about color and composition, being
something of a poet, expressing him
self through the medium of his brush
instead of his pen.
But wherefor is the distinction?
end is common to both â a mental
Impression of the thing in hand. And
this Neuhaus Rives as directly an If he
had used words, the medium of the
writer. And here is where lies much of
his strength. His work is bold, un
finished â to the unobserver â and tf
finished, "would be killed," as Whist
ler used to say.
For versatility this young German â
by getting up to leave after the next
number. Add again her soprano chat
ter In the corr'dor â to which the Se
ville Barber's "Figaro, Figaro." was a
mere pianissimo andante â whUe the
"Rienzi" number was playing, and It
will be seen the Tetrazzlnl attitude to
the* masters is hardly one of respect.
The audience itself was distinctly cul
pable. It should hereafter stand on
its hands whenever it feels like using;
them in the same way.
There are concerts where one would
have been grateful for the Tetrazzini
distraction. Last Sunday's was not
one of them. At no time during his
remarkable work here haa Polacco
been heard to better advantage. And
he was at his best in the Beethoven.
One expected from Polacco the delight
ful precision of beat, the rhythmic
swing, the supple and vivid color that
characterizes all his work. One hardly
hoped, however, for what most distin
guished the brilliant young conductor's
reading of the symphonyâ its religious
purity, its reverent and lovely con
servatism. A symphony on three notes
â and every trick and shade of them
was according to the gospel of Beeth
oven. The tempi satisfied wholly, the
scherzo not too mad, nor the larghetto
too sad.
Perhaps the scherzo went best of all,
the gargantuan scrambling of the
double-basses being nobly done. The
orchestra here achieved, too, a delicacy
of pianissimo, a staccato quite un
smudged, that we haven't had much of
with our local orchestras. The larghet
to again was charming, each new petal
of the variations unfolding surely in
all its deliciousness of form and color.
The symphony throughout was one of
the best bits of Beethoven reading we
have had here.
The Humperdlnck numbers, the
"Prelude," "Hexenrltt" and the
"Dream" from "Hansel and Gretel,"
showed the conductor on his familiar
operatic side. They were all delight
fully given. The "Bacchanale" from
the Gounod "Philemon et Baucis" was
Gounod plus Polacco, with as vivid an
infusion of personality as there was
its reverent subjection In the Beeth
oven symphony. Both processes were
equally successful, and the thing is
charming. The "Rienzi" overture
closed the programme, and if any
where one could forgive Tetrazzlni's
chatter there. Does any one like it?
One would have liked more string
value in the orchestra and less of the
drum quality in the Beethoven would
have been better, but one was might
ily proud of the local material last
Sunday, and anew delighted with its
leader.

which so many requests have been re

Opals â those are the stones in vogue
in the East. Everybody's wearing
them, encircled in diamonds, as the
dawn of the day is wrapped in dew.
Mrs. Clarence Mackay never appears
at either day or night affairs without
the now popular jewel â a gem that,
more than any other, portrays tike
lights and shadows of life.
And it is now becoming popular here
SALLY SHARP
â although a superstition still hangs
o'er It.
But look for them when the grand
opera season Is on and you will find
more opals than you have ever seen be
fore. It is coming to be a disease,
closely allied to the prevailing diÃtem
per of occultism now rampant among
women of the leisure class.
But it's harmless. It only means a
few hours less of bridge â and Induces a
contraction or two of the brain cells,
all of which stands for progress.
That performance at the Tivoli of
Friday night for the benefit of the Ma
ternity Hospital on Eighth street
brought out a smart house.
Surely, in all the city, there's no
charity more worthy.
Adult poor is pitiable, but infantile
poor Is deplorable. And among these
people ignorance is often so rife as to
produce inability of child and mother.
Success to the good WWMS) who
shoulder the labor of helping these un
fortunates to the light!

LADY ESSEX PATRONIZES
INDUSTRIES IN IRELAND
Interested in the Marble Quarries of
Connemara and the
Poplin.
LONDON. March 4.â Lady Essex dis
played an American facility for com
bining business with pleasure during
her recent trip to Ireland when she
Joined the Prince of Wales' party as
the guest of Lord Ardllaun. She had
never seen the famous Connemara
marble quarries and she drove over
In her motor car specially to see them.
The Duchess of Marlborough had pre
viously impressed her with their beau
tiful productions. The Countess was
so delighted with what she saw of the
polished marble that she assured the
quarry manager of her patronage, and
as she proposes shortly to make some
alterations In her country residence a
rabslaxttlaJ order is axDectecL aha
bought many marble ornaments, *
number of which she said she would
send to her friends in the LTnited
States.
She had heard much of the lovely
texture of Irish poplin, but had never
seen it in process of manufacture.
When she returned to Dublin she vis
ited a district called the "Liberties,"
which is adjacent to Dublin Castle, and
is one of the recognized slums of the
city on the LJffey. Here she saw an
old man close on 70 years of age work
ing away at his loom. The old fellow
is practically the last of the race of
hand loom weavers, a Dublin firm hav
ing several years ago introduced ma
chinery that is expected to produce
poplin equal In quality to that of the
hand loom.
The Countess bought a number of
dresa lengths from the firm in ques
tion, but she made no secret of the
fact that she thought there was great
er solidity in what the old man pro
duced than In the stuff prepared by
the machinery. Un her way to Dub
lin she broke her journey and paid a
visit to the celebrated balbriggan hos
iery works, where she also made con
siderable purchases. With a quan
tity of Irish linen goods which she bad
ordered sent from Belfast to London
for her inspection, her Irish visit must
have cost her a good round sum.

QUESTION OF PROBATION
FOR FAY BUCKE PENDING
Husband Writes That He Is Without
Funds, but Will Arrive Here In
Sixty Days.
No decision has yet been reached by
! Judge Lawlor as to allowing Fay
Bucke, a young married woman who
pleaded guilty to grand larceny, to go
on probation. Two weeks ago when
the case was called a letter was read
from her husband, Douglass Bucke of
Montana, praying the court not to sen
tence her and promising Jn future to
provide a home for her. It waa ex
plained that she came here last No
vember to meet her husband, but he
did not meet her, and being penniless
and friendless, she went to a resort on
Mason street. After stopping there a
few days she fled, taking with her
clothing of the value of $545 belonging
to the lessee of the house. The Judge
! continued the case for two weeka and
: advised the defendant's attorney to get
j the husband here.
Yesterday Attorney Glover submitted
! a letter he had received from the hus
; band addressed to the defendant. In
it he wrote that he waa practically
"broke" and urging her to get the case
put over for sixty days, at the end of
which he -would come here to take her
away with him. The Judge continued
I the case for two we*=>ks more and con
sented to admit the woman to ball In
$1000 bonds. Matron Christ of the Clty
Pripon promising to take care of her
till the case was disposed of.

SAVINGS DEPOSITS.
PUBLICISTS and economists resort to" the statistics of savings
bank? as an index to the condition of the industrial classes. It
teresting to know that the plan of savings banks was sug
gested by Daniel Defoe, the author of "Robinson Crusoe," in 1697.
The first one was established at .Brunswick i n 1765. The next was
at Hamburg in 1778, and then by Oldenburg in 1790, Loire in 1792,
Basel in 1792, and Geneva in 1794.
Jeremy Bentham revived Defoe's suggestion in Great Britain
ne hundred years after it was made. The indorsement of Ben
iham, whose practical philosophy has impressed all of the nations
ihat have a legislative source of laws, was sufficient to commend the
half-forgotten plan of the author. He called the system "Frugality
Banks." in accordance with his fondness for coining new terms. It
IS to Bentham that we owe the words "international," "utilitarian
and "codification." now in daily use.
The first of these "Frugality Banks" was established at Wen
â¢ by the Rev. Joseph Smith. They increased rapidly, so that by
hey attracted the attention of Government, and Parliament en
acted law for their security and control. To induce thrift among
:lie industrial classes it was provided that savings banks might take
and pay a higher rate of interest. It is probable that Jeremy Ben-
Tham's attention was attracted to the suggestion of Defoe by reason
of his views on the subject of interest. All interest was in those
days called usury, and when Bentham wrote his "Defense of Usury"
he finally disposed of the objections, moral or economic, to the taking
oi interest on money.
Soon after the beginning of the nineteenth century there w r ere
founded in Great Britain penny banks, in which deposits of that
mt were received, and then followed military, naval and sea
men's banks. This system has been extended to Germany, France,
Italy, Denmark. Russia and other countries on the continent of
Furope and to the British colonies.
The wage scale, constancy of employment and general industrial
thrift of a country may be fairly judged by the condition of its
savings banks. The latest table of reports from the whole worid
shows a total sum on savings deposits of $10,669,885,102, of which
the banks of the United States hold $3,060,178,611, or about a third
of the whole. The number of depositors in all the rest of the world
364.398. and their average deposit is $111. In the United
States 7.305.443 depositors have in the savings banks an average de
posit of $410 each. By this it would seem that industrial conditions
in this country are about fourfold better than in the rest of the
world.
The State of New York has nearly one-half of the savings de
:he country. A proposition is now pending in that State,
on the recommendation of State Bank Superintendent Kilburn, which
will attract attention throughout the country. It is that savings
banks, large institutions, be authorized by law to establish branches
here in the State. This would put savings facilities in localities
where they cannot otherwise exist. An independent bank of that
kind must have sufficient deposits to pay the cost of its administra
return the going rate of interest to depositors. This de-
â¢ â¢: us localities of independent savings facilities and the
a prime inducement to thrift. If the great banks can es
tablish branches in such localities they become in their cost part of
ge administrative system, and can pay everywhere the same in
and promote thrift and economy among the people.
Under such a system in California, our great savings banks in
San Francisco would be represented by branches in a large number
of localities and would receive, care for and earn interest on a large
aggregate sum of money that now is not banked at all and there
fore is not saved at all. for lack of facilities.
It is proposed also in New York to abolish the tax on the sur
plus of savings banks. This will mean the reduction of expenses
and the payment of larger dividends to depositors, adding an induce
ment to thrift, by the prospect of greater gains. There is in Xew
York a State Savings Bank Association to which all legislation af
fecting those institutions is referred. The effect is to discourage
cinch legislation, increase the soundness of the banks, the safety of
their security and the dividends they can pay to depositors.
California can well afford to watch the fate of these two propo
sitions in the Empire State, in the expectation that they may produce
results that will justify their adoption here.
SENATOR KEARNS 1 SPEECH.
WHILE the press reports are meager, it is evident that the
speech of Senator Kearns on Mormon rule in Utah supports
the revelations recently made in The Call. The church in
Utah has the immense power of wealth and is rapidly achieving a
control of business in that State which amounts to the monopoly of
an ecclesiastical trust. The Senator declares that, with a cunning
policy, the church seeks to keep a certain number of the apostles
and church officiary free from polygamy in order that they may have
undoubted qualifications for such civil office under the State and
National governments as it is important for the church to control.
But all such officers, including school teachers, must every year pay a
tithe of one tenth of their salaries to the church, to go into the
hands of the church president, a self-confessed polygamist, living
with five wives. In pursuance of this policy there is an effort, by
concentrating the church vote and influence, to gain a monopoly
of the salaried civil offices and get a tenth of all the public money
paid in the State to public servants.
The same policy leads to securing a monopoly in all private
employment, so that one-tenth of all the wages paid in the State
will go to the president of the church as tithes. Gentile employers
rmon labor thus become indirect contributors to the tithes/ As
such employers are systematically squeezed out of business by the
church monopoly, and it is the policy of Mormon business men to
employ only Mormons, Gentile labor in the State leads a precarious
existence.
The tithes paid to the president of the church are put by the
Senator at $1,600,000 per year. In addition to this the profits of the
various industries and businesses owned and operated by the church
all go into the same hands. As the church owns stores, mines, mills,
smelters, salt work?, street railroads and manufacturing establish
ments, it is safe to say that its profits in business are annually equal
- income from tithes. This increases its wealth at the rate of
over $3,000,000 a year. This sum is spent as the president and the
apostles choose. They render no account for it to anybody. It is
plain that much of it goes every year to the further secular aggrand
izement of the church, wherever it can buy or establish business in
any line of trade. This is crowding the Gentiles to the wall. Their
business cannot exist where every Mormon is compelled to patronize
the business establishments of the church.
The hope that Gentile immigration would soon overrun the
State and that the non-Mormon would finally exceed the Mormon
population proves to have been futile. Immigration will not go
where an ecclesiastical trust and monopoly controls everything and
denies to outsiders the right to make a living. By these processes
the complete mormonizing of Utah is making rapid progress. The
church controls courts and juries. The endowment oath of loyalty
to the church is paramount to all civil oaths and obligations. This
makes Gentile personal and property rights insecure, and is another
part of the church programme to force Gentiles out of the State
and keep more from coming in.
Some parts of this policy seem fantastic. The church has recent
ly adopted the policy of owning all of the opera-houses and theaters
in the State. This permits it to act as censor of the drama, and such
plays as the "Danites" and other dramas that are unfavorable to the
church are not permitted. In like manner the Gentile press is dis
couraged. In public printing it is discriminated against, and as the

THE WOMAN MAR
RIED FIVE YEARS.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
â " |"~" HE fact that many brides in
sist upon having the woman's
promise to "obey" struck out
â  of the marriage service is re-
garded by some people as an
evidence of the degeneracy of modern
womanhood. Occasionally you hear
young men declaring: "1 wouldn't
marry a girl who did not trust me
enough to be willing to agree to obey
me."
But Is not this discretion on a girl's
part a proof of her sincerity? Does It
not show that she is weighing the
words by which she binds herself to
the conditions of her life contract?
She is actuated, I think, by a better
motive than a wish to rebel against
masculine will. Simply she does not
mean to make a promise which she is
sure to break.
The man, however, agrees, glibly to
"cherish" the girl whom he is marry
ing without considering even the dic
tionary definition of the term. The
word is, like the others which he re
peats after the minister. Just a picket
in the fence which surrounds the mat
rimonial paradise that he wants to
enter.
Nevertheless, upon the significance of
this word, and upon the observance of
the vow which includes it, depends the
happiness of the home which the
young man is founding. Few of the
women who are cherished by their
husbands make mistakes that seriously
matter. The man who wisely cher
ishes his wife has little occasion to
worry his head over her obedience to
his will.
A pretty girl, at the age of conquest,
when ehe is sure of her power and at
tractiveness, can live on her own self
esteem, can laugh at the feminine
weakness for compliment and feel her
self superior to the appreciation which
every one stands ready gladly to ac
cord her as her undisputed right. But
when she has given to the man whom
she loves all that she has to give, when
â wifehood and motherhood and the nag
ging routine of household duties have
taken much from the freshness of her
beauty, then comes a time when she
needs to have her husband keep his
marriage vow and cherish her. And
when he fails to do so such a pitiful
human drama as the Gould-Hammond
tragedy, recently enacted in Chicago,
becomes possible.
Just think what it means when many
a wife who has charm and good looks,
and is yet in the thirties, does not ob
ject â may even be pleased â when her
husband calls her "old woman" In a
good-natured way.

Gentile fortunes and population decline the free press is being grad
ually crowded out. The Mormon community is by these means kept
from a knowledge of what religious liberty means. Mormons are
continually encouraged in polygamy by comparisons between thai
system and monogamous marriage modified by divorce. Such ex
pressions as one recently made by a prominent clergyman in Oak
land, that polygamy is preferable to divorce, are immediately put
before the readers of the Mormon press in Utah.
For this there can be but one object, and that is to suppress any
moral conviction against polygamy. Such expressions are taken as
vindications of plural marriage. If the church had in good faith
abandoned polygamy, not as a political necessity in order to secure
statehood, but for reasons entirely moral, these comparisons between
that custom and divorce would not be put before the Mormon people. ;
It all means that when by monopolizing business the Gentiles are !
made few and powerless the Mormon control of juries and courts
will make it impossible to punish polygamy, and the institution will,
flourish again as it did in the high and mighty days of Brigham i
Young.
As we have said before, the polygamy problem, while serious j
in its moral aspect, is overshadowed by the material problem pre- j
sented by church control of the secular business of the State. That,
by mormonizing Utah, means that, clothed in the garments of an
American State, there will be a theocratic commonwealth, when the
people vote as the church directs and always for its aggrandizement.
Polygamy may be treated by an amendment to the Federal con- ;
stitution, making it a Federal question, and taking parties accused
of it into another jurisdiction where non-Mormon juries can be had.
The only difficulty will be in securing evidence, so secretive are the J
methods' of the church. But what is to be done with a State in j
which the church owns the banks, mines and all industries, where I
strangers must stop at the church hotel, ride on the church street !
cars, and know that everything they pay goes into the treasury of
the church ? Only a new anti-trust law can reach such a condition of
things. It must be a law that forbids a church to engage in secular
business, and denies to it the right to boycott business that it does
not own or control.
The questions of the present a#d future raised by the policy of
the Mormon hierarchy promise to be the most difficult of solution
of any that have yet appeared under our form of government.

It Is not romance that a woman ex

her husband's income, and caring for

that she exacts of him. It is just plain

DEPEW DEFENDS
INTERNATIONAL
MARRIAGES
The argument set forth by Senator
Depew not long since in favor of in
ternational marriages finds strong
support in the columns of the County
Gentleman, an English paper. Accord
ing to this journal there is not a single
instance of Anglo-American matches
in high life which has failed to bring
domestic happiness with it. "We shall
be curious." it adds, "to see whether
these marriages will be the precursor*
cf others in the more modest sphere
of life and income. So far they are
in nearly every case confined to the
wealthiest and leisured class on both
sides. It would be interesting to
know how far the American girl would
be happy as the mistress of the ordi
nary professional man's house, with
some fifteen hundred a year to live
upon. Probably there is very little
doubt that she would make a success
of it."â Leslie's Weekly.

The bottomless pit is where a man's

WEAR OVERCOATS INDOOR
"In Santiago, the Chilean capital,
where I have been residing for some
years, it is common to see people put
on their overcoats when they enter a
house and take them off upon going
into the street," said John W. Taylor,
formerly of San Francisco.
"The cause of this is that the at
mosphere on the outside is warmer
than within the residences. The Chil
eans do not heat their domiciles to any
extent and they are constructed of
such thick walls that they are a good

After several months of hard study
a committee of doctors appointed to

causes a variety of things:
Firstâ The habit of tea drinking.
Tea, if not too strong, warms the
stomach, flushes the system and aids
digestion and circulation.
Second â The diet, which is simple
and easily digested.
Thirdâ The habit of living in the
open air.
Fourth â The fashion of wearing large
shoes and generally loose clothing.
The?e things promote the health and
furnish the material for the clear skin
for which the English woman is noted.

I erect and self-assured, on
â¢ "the threshold of her daugh
ter's room.
"Certainly, mamma." Kathrine drew
forward a chair with a simple, direct
movement that was in striking con
trast to her mother's more bulky, self
conscious exertions In seating herself.
"What a blessing it is that you are
tall and slender and handsome, Kath
rine!" ejaculated the older woman.
"And how very fortunate it was," she
"Are You Acquainted With Mrs.
Van Harkness?" She Asked.
added thoughtfully, 'that Mr. Price
was presented to you the very first
evening we were here."
"You did not seem so pleased at the
time," ventured Kathrine, her face
turned from her mother.
"Well, perhaps not," conceded Mrs.
Meredith, nonplussed for an instant;
but, continuing with even more than
her usual firmness, "You must remem
ber, however, that I knew nothing â
absolutely nothing â about him or his
position socially, and one cannot be
too careful about the people one meets
in a hotel. To be sure," she continued,
'â¢this is the most fashionable hotel in
Elm Heights, but there are people here
whom we do not care to meet. "
"Very likely," agreed Kathrine. "Per
haps the others are also trying to get
acquainted with desirable people!"
"My dear," said Mrs. Meredith cold
ly, "I do not like the tone in which you
made that remark. I wish you could
learn to appreciate the advantages of
social position; your indifference along
that line really annoys me. You are so
like your poor father; he was always
unwise in his choice of friends, picking
up odd, bookish people, and poor art
iste and musicians, never anyone with
wealth and social attainments. It was
very trying, and yet I never could
make him realize his mistake."
Kathrine opened her lips to speak,
but quickly closed them, trying to con
quer their quivering, as she recalled
her dead father, whose frank nature,
with its refined tastes and serene disre
gard for worldly conventions was so
like her own.
"However," continued Mrs. Meredith,
her face brightening, "we won't speak
of that now. I almost forgot to tell
you the interesting news I heard. Mrs.
Wilmington just told me that Mr.
Price's sister, Mrs. Karsell, is a friend
or 1 Mrs. Van Harkness!"
"Of THE Mrs. Van Harknesa?" ques
tioned Kathrine, doubtruuy.
â¢Exactly," said Mrs. Meredith, with
radiant satisfaction. "That means a
great deal â more than you are able to
appreciate, my dear. How very fortu
nate it is that we have met them. I
shall certainly improve the acquaint
ance."
"But you have met Mrs. Van Hark
ness yourself, have you not?" queried
Kathrine.
"Oh. yes," impatiently. "I took care
to mention the fact to Mrs. Wilming
ton. But if Mrs. Karsell is an inti
mate friend of Mrs. Van Harknessâ"
Mrs. Meredith hurried off to dress for
dinner, leaving her sentence unfinished,
Kathrine, left alone, gazed steadily
at her image in the mirror. "Yes." she
thought dispassionately, "I am hand
some, and I suppose that I could mar
ry well, according to mamma's stand
ard, which means a certain social posi
tion, and the money to maintain it.
Mamma regards love as an unimpor
tant accessory, which is very well in
its way, but not necessary. " The girl
moved Impatiently. "How mean it
seems.' How degrading, this constant
anxiety and effort to be one of a cer
tain set! Why can't we be happy Just
where we are? I wonder if Mr. Price
has social ambitions."
â¢ â¢ â¢
"Well, Anna," said Dick, a trifle im
patiently, as they were returning from
a drive, "what was it you wanted to
speak to me about?"
Mrs. Karsell hesitated a moment, and
then exclaimed dramatically: "Oh.
Dick, it's that girl!"
"Do you mean Miss Meredith?" ask
led Dick quietly.
"Whom else could I mean?" cried
Anna. "Ycu are with her all of the
time."
â¢ Not quite all of the time." mur
mured Dick, with menial regret.
"It amounts to that, anyway," insist
ed his sister. "And after all my hopes
for youâ it's too bad, Dick. I do want
you to marry some one who can ad
vance you socially. Now. this Miss
Meredith is a sweet girl, doubtless"

"And care less." Dick wanted to add,
I but refrained. Insteud he remarked
; wisely: "I heard Mre. Wilmington tell
: some of the women on the veranda that
Mrs. Meredith is a friend of Mrs. Van
Harkness."
"Of THE Mrs. Van Harkness?" Mrs.
j Karsell's anxious t<me spoke volumes,
"Yes, Indeed," confirmed Dick-
Mrs. Karsel said no more on the
j subject until they were approaching thÂ»
' hotel.
"In regard to Miss Meredith, Dick,"
she began pleasantly, "I may have
: been a little hasty in my Judgment. I
j shall try to become better acqualnte-I
with her and her mother. Friends â I
; Mrs. Van Harkness are certaintly
j worth cultivating."
Dick thankful his stars that he had
thought of mentioning- the piece of gos
sip he had overheard.
"As if I cared a rap for Kathrine's
I social position." he muttered, with some
! heat. "Anna thinks because I ha
I that money from uncle's estate I ought
I to take a fashionable wife and set up
lan establishment. That's not my iJea
of happiness. I want a sweet, woiaan
ly woman, who cares for something be
aides a round of dinners, receptions
and dances â how sweet Kathrine look
ed last evening." he broke off suddenly.
'. "She is a beautiful girl. I wonder If
1 Mrs. Meredith has 'aspirations' for
Kathrineâ l hope not, " he ended fer
! vently.
The next day found Mrs. Karsell and
I Mrs. Meredith each eager to enjoy the
society of "a friend of Mrs. Van Hark
' ness, you know," as they explained to
! their less fortunate associate*, and th*
, two women spoke at that lady with
th^ easy familiarity an old friend
adopts.
â¢ Mrs. Karsell Is very pleasant. In
deed." said Mrs. Meredith to her
! daughter, with evident satisfaction.
â¢She and I had a !o n g talk this after
| n<>on, and I feel quite as if we were
! old friends. One can see that she is
1 accustomed to moving in the best cir
i cles. She had heard that I knew Mrs.
I Van Harkr.pss; Mrs. Wilmington must
I have repeated It."
"I suppose you told her you had Just
! met her and could not lay claim even
I to an acquaintanceship?"
"I saw no necessity for going Into
J details," responded Mrs. Meredith in
i her most dignified tones.
Meanwhile Dick was listening with
: evident satisfaction to his sister's
; praise of Mrs. Meredith and Kathrine.
"Such pleasant people! And, really.
Miss Meredith is very attractive. I
am so glad I have met them, for from
what the mother 3ays they must be
excellent friends of Mrs. Van Hark
ness."
"You explained that your own ac
quaintance with that lady is very su
perficial, no doubt," said Dick care
lessly.
"Wen. no, Dick. Really, you know,
she seemed to take it for granted that
I was an Intimate friend, and it would
have been so embarrassing to explain. "
"Of course, erf course," assented
Dick, with unusual sympathy.
A week passed byâ a week full >>f
happiness for Kathrine and Dick, who
walked and boated and played golf to
their hearts' content, and to th
finite satisfaction of the mother and
sister, who saw in their love a means
of social advancement.
The crash came on Wednesday af
ternoon, when Mrs. Wilmington hur
ried out on the hotel piazza to find
Mrs. Meredith and Mrs. Karsell.
"I knew I'd find you here together."
she cried, bearing down on them tri
umphantly; "and here come Miss Mer
edith and Mr. Price, too. How lovely!
You will never guess who arrived this
morning. Ah!" lowering her voice sud
denly, "there she comes now â Mrs.
Van Harkness:"
It was an awful moment. There was
neither time nor opportunity for escape,
and to stay meant almost certain hu
miliation to at least two of the little
group.
"She will never remember me," Mrs.
Meredith groaned Inwardly. "Mrs.
Karsell will make me the laughing
stock of all our friends! "
"After all I have said," thought the
younger woman, in an agony of shame
"What will Mrs. Meredith think! If
only Mrs. Van Harknesa does recall
me!"
The two women sat. tense and
speechless, as Mrs. Van Harkness
moved slowly toward them. Her eyes
fell languidly on the little group. Her
expression was that of cold Indiffer
ence. She sailed slowly by without a
sign of recognition!
"Let's go," whispered Dick, and he
and Kathrine slipped out through a
convenient doorway.
It was a rather silent and abstracted
pair who started out on their usual
morning tramp. Only commonplace
speeches were uttered until they
reached a large, flat rocs: by the shady
roadside.
"Shall we rest here before starting
back?" suggested Dick.
"I am a little tired," confessed Kath
rine.
There waa a Bhort silenoe during
which Dick stared disconsolately at her
hat brim. It was suddenly raised, and
a pair of brown eyes, shining with sup
pressed mirth, flashed on him.
"Are you acquainted with Mrs. Van
Harkness?" she asked, mischievously.
"Oh, I say, that was pretty rough
on my sister," said Dick, his face flush
ing slightly, though his lips were smil
ing.
"It was a dreadful disappointment to
both of them."
"Just think." she added, regretfully,
"what an advantage it would have
been to be able to say, 'My friend. Mrs.
Van Harkness, thinks so-and-so ' "
"Quite true." responded Dick. "Such
a boost to one's social position, you
know."
They laughed.
"I don't care a rap for It all." said
Dick, vigorously.
"Nor I," agreed Kathrine.
There was a momenrs silence.
"I love you, Kathrine. dear."
No answer.
"Do you care a little for me. Kath
rine? Enough to marry me, dear?"
Still no answer.
"Kathrine:" pleadingly.
"Iâ lâ yes, Dick. Oh, Dick.'"

INAUGURAL BALL
WASHINGTON, March 4. â 
Washington is to-night
In the hands of the
smart set of the nation.
For forty-eight hours
I from the North, East. South and
West have brought to the national
capital thousands representing the
wealth, beauty, brains and chivalry of
the country to mingle with official life
ctntering about the White House.
To-night, however, it is the old
Pension building, rather than the
Executive Mansion, upon which every
eye :n Washington is trained, for be
neath its vast roof the Inaugural Ball
is on â and in full swing. Splendid in
mil truth is this great social function
of a great nation â diplomats from all
the world powers, a-glitter with gold
end gay with decorations; officers of the
Â«rmy and navy, resplendent in braid
Â«nd bullion, and hundreds of superb
1" gowned women, types from every
part of the nation, are gathered be
rÂ«-&th one roof. For a fortnight the
solemn old Pension building has been
Â§r:ven up to the decorators and elec
tricians, and to-night even the archi
tect who built it would scarcely recog
nize hie handiwork, for little remains
Visible of its interior features save the
"broad upper gallery that overlooks the
lower court, and the marble columns
mat support it.
From Florida came hundreds of
Tragnolia blooms with their waxen
leaves; from the Carolina* graceful
palmettos, with tons of smilax and
Virginia creeper. Bermuda lilies and
American Beauty ropÂ«s nod and beck
li. every nook, a thousand thousand
l.ghts revealing their beauty in the
Jungle of green. Truly, nevef was the
floral setting of an inaugural ball so
closely rivaling the famous
liradley-Martin ball of half a dozen
>tare ago.
All this formed the background for
some of the handsomest and cleverest
v.omen of the nation, gowned as befit
fo brave an occasion. And every
irown that could be seen â and un
happily there were many in the crush
that met with the misfortune of ob
ty â were masterpieces of the
-maker's art. It ie at such affairs,
s are gathered the women of all
ns of the country, that a fair
may be formed of the com
:â . merican woman aa she is bo-
. â her manner of dress, her de
t, her personality. .
And to-night the diction has gone
. that the. American woman does
how to dress, how to depo t
hf-rsplf with grace and dignity â and
that her personality is her fortune.
For thus many of the foreigners, who,
c are diplomats, have unani
mously agreed, and assuredly we are
willing to take their word for It.
Mrs. Roosevelt, as first lady of the
]and, stood at the head of the re-
Ins line flanked by the ladies of
the Cabinet.
While not conspicuously a lady of
fashion, Mrs. Roosevelt's gown was a
euperb creation, suiting her rather
severe style In admirable manner, both
as to texture and design.
Of pale blue brocade, there ran
through it threads of silver tinsel in
c-ntional design, shimmering and
g..rruii* like moonlight on a mountain
lake. It was fashioned in Princess
style, over a petticoat of Mechlin lace.
This lace elaboration was carried up
t.< the bodice, which was simply fin
ished with folds of pale blue tulle.
On either side of the petticoat of lace
pale blue satin fell back in soft folds,
while the long seams at the back and
sides were deftly concealed by silver
embroidery' of vines with tiny tendrils,
Which scheme was carried out about
the hem and upon the full court train.
From the shoulders fell a bertha of
Mechlin lace, upon which gleamed
three splendid pearl and diamond
ornaments.
This exquisite gown of the first lady
of the land bore the unique distinction
of being absolutely an American crea
tion, both as to texture, design and
building â proclaiming to the fashion
able world that America has entered
tht lists with the famed milliners of
Paris and entered for "keeps."
It is said that the design after which
the silk was woven was destroyed imm
ediately after its manufacture, a
pretty compliment to the gracious
wuarer â for if there be one element of
joy about a gown more dear to the
feminine hear; than another, it is that
of exclusiveness. Lucky Mrs. Roose
velt:
Another fascinating gown was that
worn by Mrs. Fairbanks, the hand
some wife of the new Vice President,
v. ho, in spite of many comments to
'he contrary, stood next to Mrs. Roose
velt in receiving, thereby setting at
rest some unstable questions of pre
cedent. Mrs. Fairbanks is a tall, stout
woman, of much dignity of carriage
and of character â which, by the way,
eeem to be closely allied. Her gown
waÂ» of heavy white Duchesse satin,
embroidered in roses, with a spun
told thread. To impart a suggestion
of slenderness the bodice and skirt
bc-re the same scheme of ornamenta
tion, consisting of a mass of tiny ruf
fles of Brussels applique, beginning at
the corsage, narrowing to the waist,
then widening on the front panel of
the skirt to the hem. Outlining the
lace garniture on the skirt lay heavy
folds of the satin, simulating a petti
coat of lace. In her hair Mrs. Fair
banks wore a tall, white aigrette, such
as are now so very smart, imparting
height and elegance to the tout en
semble. A diamond necklace com
pleted a very beautiful toilette.
Among the maids who were distinct
ly pretty at the ball was Miss Jose
phine Durand, the petite daughter of
the British Embassador. A pink
cheeked maid of dignified mien, her
frock bore out her Interesting person
alky. It was made of white tulle over
several slips of white chiffon, which
veiled in mystic fashion the sheen of a
soft, white satin clip beneath. The
skirt was shirred over the hips, its sole
decoration being a lattice work of sil
ver tinsel around the bottom, beneath
which peeped two fluffy tulle ruffles,
edged with fine Valenciennes. To Im
part the Idea of fullness about the
feet several ruffles of mousseline over
white satin were used with good ef
fect. The bodice, which like most of
the smart gowns, was cut low on the
shoulders â NOT square in the decol
letage, as has been prophesied by the
dressmakers â was a simple blouse ef-
feet of shirred tulle embroidered In
fleux de lis design in silver.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5. 1905.
A Valenciennes ruffle finished the
edge of the bodice, which was further
ornamented with strands of pearls,
v, hi-h extended across to the plump,
pink arms in lieu of sleeves. A full
puff of tulle at the shoulders g-ave
v:nth to the figure â and breadth of
shoulder must be obtained if a gown
would be smart.
Here a touch of pink gave distinc
tion to this dainty frock, consisting of
two wreaths of tiny baby roses, placed
at the jointure of the bodice and the
shoulder puff. And again were the
two wreaths repeated on her soft,
brown pompadour â a pretty conceit,
and vastly becoming to a pink-cheeked
maid.
But who, pray, to-day need be with
out pink cheeks to match such a cos
tume when there is a masseuse at
every comer â and a drug store?
Among the Cabinet ladies, Mrs. Paul
Morton, wife of the Secretary of the
Navy, was conspicuously well-gowned,
which was, however, to be expected,
since Mrs. Morton and her daughters
have long been considered paragon's of
style and good form. Mrs. Morton
chose for her ball gown â the gown of
the yearâ a soft, silver brocade, Illu
sive and shimmery as twilight in sum
mer. Embroidered upon it lay soft
pink roses, bearing out the suggestion
the last rays of a summer's day. Be
tween these, tiny roses were worked in
silver.
As with nearly all the other matron's
gowns, a petticoat effect was produced
on the skirtâ this time opening over
tulle, embossed with sliver. The bod-
Ice was finished with a bertha of rose
point lace, falling slightly over the
sleeves â and these formed the original
note of the costume. Of pale gray
satin, they were fashioned into puffs,
with silver-embossed tulle alternating.
These were held firmly together by a
slender rope of silver, fastened in the
center by a rhinestone ornament. The
low tones of this splendid gown were
relieved by a dog-collar and tiara of
diamonds that caught and gave back
the gleam of a thousand lights.
Miss Pauline Morton, who, by the
way, visited with her parents in San
Francisco last year during a tour of
the West, was a refreshing picture in
pale blue tulle over white chiffon. Tiny
pink roses gave a piquant touch to the
debutante's frock, which, with Miss
Alice Roosevelt's, was one of the sim
plest and yet most effective of all the
maidens' costumes.
Mrs. Victor H. MetcaK was gowned
in pompadour silk, with deep cream
foundation and large blue flowers of
the gardenia pattern, skirt full and
ruffled on under lining with deep chif
fon pleatings of blue, the shades of
the flowers, the green of the leaves
and the browns of the Btems making
an unusually effective finishing. The
bodice was decollete, with ruffles of
vari-colored chiffon and choux of
lace around the corsage and gath
ered in a knot on the left side. Just
above the waist line. A wide pointed
girdle of silk completed the costume.
Mrs. Metcalf wore diamonds and
sapphires and carried a bouquet of
violets.
Being a diplomatic and a wholly of
ficial function, the Inaugural Ball Is
not especially a debutante's affair, the
formality of It, with its endless social
red-tape, proving something of a bore
to the gay little maids from school.
Thus the Inaugural Ball, with its
triumphal recognition of rank, wealth
and social achievement, comes to be
the matron's night to shine â and not in
reflected light, lest indeed, it be the
glamour of her husband that sur
rounds her.
And the truth to tell, most of the
women at to-night's ball were amply
able to stand by themselves as types
of high-bred, Intelligent, high-spirited
Americans, with quite enough of per
senal qualities to be reckoned with on
their own account. And they were,
judging from the devout attention paid
many of them from the foreign con
tingent.
And, by the way, this function was
the first national affair at which many
attaches of the diplomatic corps have
officiated and was provokatlve of much
comment â especially about the young
girls, their poise, their style, their can
dor.
The ladies of the army were rep
resented by Mrs. Chaffee, wife of the
distinguished chief of staff. Her gown
of white satin bore a distinctive dec
orative feature, embroidery wrought
by the deft fingers of the Chinese in
the chrysanthemum design. This
adaptation of needlework from the
Far East made a most effective front
panel to the skirt, spreading to the
sides and toward the hem of that gar
ment. A superb bertha of d'Alencon
lace finished the bodice, which, like
nearly all the other stunning gowns,
was cut round. Mrs. Chaffee wore
some splendid jewels.
Among the ladies of the diplomatic
corps none was more fascinating than
the dashing Baroness Mayor dcs
Planches, wife of the Italian Embas
sador, who chose a pale yellow net,
bejeweled with sequins of mother of
pearl. The foundation of this gown
was of pale yellow satin, fitted snugly
to the figure. Over this was a slip of
white chiffon and then the fine
meshed net. At the hem of the skirt,
which was gored close to the hips and
flared generously at the foot, a broad
band of the sequins was introduced,
below which fell a soft, fluffy flounce
of the jeweled net. The bodice was
decorated with a fall of rose point
lace, forming a V and extending over
the shoulder to form the sleeve. To
the Baroness* type of beauty this plain
splendor was superbly becoming.
The gown was an Imported affair,
coming from the fair Itallenne's dress
maker in Turin, the Baroness not yet
finding the courage to try the Amer
ican gown builder, but she will, if she
stays in Washington long enough.
Among the many deductions to be
made from the most effective gowns
at the ball are these: The skirts are
close-fitting about the hips; flaring
tcward the hem; the Princesse gown
prevails, many showing a petticoat of
lace on contrasting material; the
bodices are cut round â not square, as
has been threatened; few sleeves are
sworn, save a full puff at the shoulder,
and newest note of all â which is really
a revival of a pretty old custom â the
wearing of natural flowers at the cor
sage or in the hair.
And there was a striking demonstra
tion of the revival of old Jewelry â old
settings and quaint gems. We'd
chains were seen everywhere, from

which were suspended jeweled or
jetted fans bearing the same color
tones.
Quite distinctive and apart from the
official set was the coterie that ran
down from New York, by whom some
bizarre costumes were worn. Many of
these Gothamites arrived as guests of
Miss Alice Roosevelt, who, ever since
her coming out, has been the possessor
of friendships not shared in by her
mother or father, but that are suited
to her chic, daring personality. To
this her father has never objected,
since the friends she chooses are the
offspring of the conservative old fami
lies of New York.
Baltimore and Philadelphia were
well represented, as was New Orleans.
But it is of common comment that
among the New York guests women
hold the palm for dash and splendor.
TAKES SEVEN
PARTS IN PLAY
Henri de Vries, a Dutchman,
Makes Great Hit on Stage
in the English Metropolis
Special Cable to ThÂ« Call and New York
Herald. Copyright, 1906, by the NÂ»w York
Herald Publishing Company.
LONDON, March 4. â The sensation
of the moment in London is the act-
Ing of Henri de Vries, the Dutchman.
Of quick change performers there
have been many In recent years, but
heretofore none of them, not even
Fregoli, could be described as a really
great actor. De Vries, however, who
is playing seven out of the nine parts
In a one-act play now being given at
the Royalty Theater, is the possessor
of uncommon genius, entirely apart
from his rapid changes of character.
The piece in which he is appearing
Is an unusually dramatic one, Hey
erman's "Case of Arson." The scene
is the office of a Dutch examining
magistrate. He has in hand the ex
amination of witnesses in the case of
a man. who, to get out of money dif
ficulties, had set nre to his own house
and unwittingly burned his own child.
These witnesses, all of whom are
played by De Vries, included the un
witting murderer, John Arend; his
half-witted brother, who is suspected
of the crime; an old dotard of a
father-in-law, a police sergeant, an
innkeeper, a grocer and a house
painter.
The Dutch actor manages to make
each of them a study in itself and it
is generally admitted that no actor on
the English stage could come any
where near duplicating his perform
ance. De Vries originally gave "A
Case of Arson" in his own tongue at
the Royalty about a year ago. Now,
however, he plays it in English, a
translation of Heyerman's original
having been made by Howard Percy.
MARSHALL'S LATEST PLAY.
Captain Marshall's new farce com
edy. "The Lady of Leeds," which, as
Its name suggests, Is a paraphrase of
"The Lady of Lyons," was evidently
written in forgetfulness of the fact
that if all the characters in a play are
uniformly contemptible the impres
sion that play will produce is bound
to be unpleasant, however bright the
lines or Ingenious the situations. The
fate of Plnero's "Wife Without a
Smile" Is evidence In point.
Miss Euphemia Chltty. a ginger-ale
manufacturer's daughter, who is the
Lady of Leeds, is pictured as being as
vulgar as she is rich â the type that
used to be labeled "American Girl"
until the absurdity of it became ap
parent. She rejects in turn two aris
tocratic fortune hunters, who, to get
even with her in a nice, gentlemanly
way, get hold of an ex- waiter and in
troduce him to her as an Archduke.
His mistakes supply the most of the
fun. The story moves along lightly,
brightly and skillfully; but it is
scarcely worthy of Captain Marshall
and is not likely to la3t long.
At the eecond performance of The
Lady of Leeds" a man in evening dress
rose In his seat In one of the boxes
and, addressing the audience, stated
that there rvas a real ginger-ale manu
facturer bearing the name mentioned
in the play and that this individual
strongly objected to his appellation be
ing so freely used.
It is hard to escape this sort of thing,
as A. W. Pinero knows. Soon after the
production of his most famous ;
several Mrs. Tanquerays in real life
popped up with protestations, and dur
ing the run of "The Notorious
Ebbsmith" a woman thus named com
mitted suicide. And during the run afl
"Letty" it developed that there were
quite a lot of bucket-shop owners m
London bearing the name which Pinero
had conferred upon the one in the play.
Jul'a Nielson and her husband, Fred
Terry, have the best of reasons for be
lieving that, after all, "reviews" have
little or nothing to do with a play *
success. Seldom has a piece got a more
vigorous "slating" than that met-.,
to Baroness Orc2y-Barstow's play.
'â¢The Scarlet Pimpernel," the Terrys'
present offering at the New Theater.
With one voice the criflcs pronounced
it Impossible, yet this drama of tin*
French Revolution has now passed inT
fiftieth performance.

Shakespeare is now a member of the
theatrical profession in this country.
The player in question Is a young man,
who traces his descent in a straight
line from one of the bard's daughters.
Had he cared to trade on his ancestry
this young actor probably would have
had no difficulty in getting something
pretty good to start with, but being
possessed of a good deal of prid^ he has
preferred to fight the battle as his great
ancestor himself fought it, and so from
the start he has taken the best he could
get in the ordinary way and at present
is appearing in a small part in a Lon
don musical play.
In appearance the . descendant of
Shakespeare is slight and of about mid
dle height, with a thoughtful face. The
limited number of hl3 acquaintances
who are aware of the facts regarding
his ancestry are naturally watching his
career with unbounded interest.

CHICAGO. March 4,â After opening easier
! in sympathy with lower prices at Liverpool, ,
j the wheat market here soon developed firm
' ness, the strength Increasing as th* \ session !
advanced, The weakness of foreign wheat j
markets was largely due to heavy shipments ;
from Australia. The foreign f weakness was
partly attributed to predictions of bearish
statistics for Monday. Opening quotations '
here showed slight' losses, May being off %o
to Vie at $1 15* to $1 15%. July waa un
changed to %c lower at 96\0 to 9SJÂ»o. From
the start the May option was in fair demand,
but trading in distant deliveries waa late i
throughout the day. The apparent cause, of
the comparative activity in .May was an in- '
creasing demand for cash wheat at all grain 'â .
centers. Shorts were the principal buyers of j
the May option here. After, touching $1 15^ i
shortly after the -opening. May steadily ad
vanced until the price reached $1 16J4. Mean- j
time July sold up to eo^c
Th* continued smallne** of primary receipts '
as compared v/lth a year ago was a strength- i
ening factor. # Later in th* day a slight reac
tion occurred on proflt-taklng but the market

CELESTIAL DISAPPEARS
AND PUZZLES BAILIFFS
Judge Mogan's Courtroom Scene
of Coolie Vanishing Act.
FUGITIVE FOUND UNDER CLERK'S DESK
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
By mysteriously disappearing while
he was on trial for vagrancy. Ah
Chung conveyed consternation to Po
lice Judge Mogan's two bailiffs, who
were temporarily entrusted with his
custody. He was standing in close
propinquity to Bailiff Ilickey when
the vanishing: act occurred. The of
ficer diverted his gaze, from the pris
oner Just long enough to address an
admonitory "H-i-s-h" to a babbling
opium siave in the cage, but during
that moment Ah Chung apparently
melted into nothingness. Where he
had stood there was atmosphere only.
The bailiff stretched forth his hand
and then rubbed his eyes to make sure
he was not laboring under an optical
delusion and then he glanced upward,
as if expecting to see a Chinaman
floating in the ether. Behind him was
the rail, in front of him the bench, at
his right the clerk's desk, at his left
the iron-barred dock. It, was impos
sible for Ah Chung to have fled to
ward any point of the compass and it
also was evident that he had neither
soared aloft nor dropped through the
Uneoleum covered floor. Where, then,
could he have gone to? Hlckey was
mutely wrestling with the conundrum
when the Judge spoke and broke the
spell.
"What does the defendant cay for
him but where Is the defendant?"
Bailiff Mahoney vaulted the rail in
his eagerness to succor a bewildered
comrade. Clerk Gray leaped from his
chair and with eagle eye swept the
auditory. The attorneys' table arose
as one man and craned Its neck to
ward the astounded Judge.
"Where is the defendant?" came in
stern reiteration from the bench.
In the ensuing scurry the bailiffs
were most active, Mahoney running
hither and yon and Hickey shaking
his clothes with desperate hope that
the missing one would drop from
them. Then, above the commingled
sounds of scraping feet and muttered
whispers there suddenly arose a rau
cous soughing, such as is heard when
the last of the water in a bathtub is
drawn into the drain pipe. The gur
gle was quickly traced to its source
and from beneath the clerk's desk
was drawn the huddled form of Ah
Chung. He was wrapped in slumber
and did not regain complete wakeful
ness until his trial was concluded.
Patrolman Kennedy testified that
he arrested Ah Chung on complaint of
several housewives, who had been
much frightened by his nocturnal vis-
Its to their respective abodes In the
Richmond District- When they re
sponded to his knock on the door, the
ladies said, he grimaced and chattered
in such a hideous way that they ex
perienced difficulty in abstaining from
falling In a swoon.
When the Judge asked the defend
ant If he had any excuse to offer for
his scaring of the complainants he
drowsily muttered. "Alle dam foolee,"
thereby strengthening the court's sus
picion that he was of unsound mind,
and to the Lunacy Commissioners he
was consigned for examination.
Mike Sweeney, accused of begging
in the Western Addition, informed
Judge Frit* that the complaining po
liceman had committed an annoying
Blunder, inasmuch as he (defendant)
was a gardener and had S3 35 in one
of his pockets when he was "pinched."
his possession of the money being
sufficient of Itself to relieve him of
suspicion of being a vagrant. He
would not deny that he had solicited
food from a householder, but he had
done ao because there were no res
taurants within a reasonable distance
of where he wu employed in renovat
ing a garden, the exact location of
which he failed to remember. As the
record credited him with several prior
convictions on the charge of begging
he got thirty days.
Judge Cabaniss instructed Bailiff
Nell Carmichael to hasten to the cor
ridor and proclaim with loud voice
that Giovanni Cirrogliagolosis was
wanted to testify in the battery case
then under hearing, but the bailiff,
after attempting to pronounce softly
the name of the desired witness, con
fessed his inability to get his tongue
around it in such a way as to make its
utterance intelligible.
"I'm no able to ca' it. on that's â /
there's tae it," he explained.
"The prosecution insists that this

trict Attorney Hanley.
"Then ca' him yersel," rejoined the
bailiff.
"Why, it's aisy," said Clerk Barney
Conlan, "when ye take yer time at it.
Here, I'll write it down for ye, and ye
can call it in chunks."
Further contention was happily
averted and the wheels of Justice were
enabled to resume revolution by the
needed gentleman walking into court
and announcing his readiness to take
the witness stand.
After months of Indoor rehearsal
the brass band organized by Twin
Peaks Parlor, N. S. G. W., believed it
had attained sufficient proficiency in
the production of concordant sounds
to justify it in unloading them upon
the outer air. Besides, It was consid
ered needful to practice marching and
playing simultaneously, which could
not be done conveniently within the
limited area of a hall. Aware, how
ever, that popular taste in the matter
of music Is somewhat diversified, the
instrumentalists, although perfectly
satisfied with their execution, deemed
it prudent to make their first collec
tive venture abroad at a time when
the streets would be least likely to
contain possible scoffers. That was
how the echoes of that portion of the
Mission district embracing the inter
section of Twenty-third and Ouerrero
rtreets came to be abruptly awakened
at 10:30 o'clock la sit PrMay ni^ht by
a number o? bnizen instruments :ui<l
drums bursting into the strains of "I'll
Meet You !n St. Louey, Louey." And
that was also how J. E. Middleton, T.
Jf. Haggerty, James Leahy and James
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1905.
McGrath, young fellows, came to be
arrested for belaboring the bandmen
with slats and laths which had evi
dently been detached from a building
in course of erection.
Patrolmen Clancy and Ryan In
formed Judge Mogan that the four de
fendants were a minority of the crowd
of youths that suddenly poured from
the unfinished structure and assailed
the Instrumentalists, who were march-
Ing with admirable precision and play
ing both heartily and in harmony when
the onslaught began. So taken by sur
prise was the band that it was dlsin
tregated and fleeing in various direc
tions ere it fully realized what had
struck it, else it might have repulsed
the attack, or at least retreated in un
broken order. The tune begun so mel
odiously terminated in tatters, the
b-flat cornet emitting the final toot as
its operator's back was smitten with
a slat.
The Judge gravely chided the cower
ing quartet, saying that their effort
should have been to encourage the fine
arts, and coldly ignoring an uncalled
for remark from counsel for the de
fense to the effect that the prevention
of musio by his clients might be diffi
cult to prove. The childing was all
the punishment prescribed.

Lulu Bland was her maiden name, she
told Judgre Fritz, and she resumed it
after her husband was forced to flee
from his plantation in Cuba by the
Governmental tyranny that Shatter
and Sampsonâ to say nothing of Schley
â subsequently rebuked so effectively.
"vVith the proceeds of the devastated es
tate, which she sold just as soon as
peace was restored to the Island, she
started out to search the world for her
exiled spoi^e, but the quest has been
unsuccessful, and she remains in doubt
as to whether her widowhood Is of the
grass or graveyard kind. Accompany
ing her on the earth-scouring expedi
tion is George Henry, who for many
years was her husband's most trusted
henchman and whose falthtul services
she would find it most difficult, if not
impossible, to dispense with, as he
does for her In her search many things
which her sex and inherent refinement
v ould prevent her doing for herself,
euch as exploring the Blums.
It was at George's sugsestlon. Miss
Bland continued, that she visited the
Pacific-street rianee hall in which both
of them were arrested by Patrolman
Joy, who charged them with vagTancy.
George had told her â he was quite a
graphic raconteur â of the ludicrous
aances performed by the Afro-Ameri
can denizens of the under world, and
It was with Intent to elevate her spir
its, which were given to drooping as
ehe thought of hÂ«r lost one, that he
induced her to see the laughable speo
tacle for herself. With similar intent,
no doubt, he persuaded her to trip a
measure with him In the dance hall,
and "he would not deny that her care
was temporarily forgotten until the
policeman's hand clutched her shoul
der. Yes, George was unquestionably
of Ethiopian ancestry, as his skin de
noted. What? Negro blood in her
veins? If that question were a Jest it
was a very sorry one. Although her
complexion was rather tawny, the
proudest brand of Cuban corpuscles
were hers. Didn't the gentlemen know
that the Cuban climate has a decided
ly blackening effect upon the olive
skinned dauhters of Castile? No?
Well, it has.
Patrolman Joy, with Mephisto
phelean sneer, listened to the lady's
narrative, and at Its conclusion inform
ed the court that within a few days he
could produce testimony more than
sufficient to pronounce it a canard from
start to finish. She was a "vag," ho
asserted, also a "coon," and If he
couldn't prove both assertions he
would â well, no matter.
Bo the case of Senora Somebody (nee
Bland) was continued ten days, and
the faithful George obtained release by
promising that he would either be hard
at work or out of town within twenty

HOWE ARRESTED
FOR SWINDLING
Charged With Selling Stock
in Mine He Did Not Own,
Promising 36 Per Cent Gain
FEDEKAL JURY INDICTS
Finding Divorce Without
Publicity Slow He Branches
Out in British Gold Fields
Of eight secret file indictment* re
turned to the United States District
Court yesterday the most important
was that agrainst George W, Howe,
who for many years conducted a "di
vorce without publicity" business in
this city. He is charged in the present
Indictment with using the malls to fur
ther a mining; swindle. The case was
cleverly worked up by Postoffice In
spector James O'Connell, to whom the
complaints of many victimised persons
had been referred, and who describes
Howe's operations as follows:
Howe was the promoter of the Yale
Gold Mining Company of Vernon in
British Columbia, and of its sponsor,
the Stock, Guaranty and Surety Com
pany of San Francisco with offices at
1122 Market street. Howe issued rose
colored circulars offering thirty-six per
cent per annum dividends to stock
holders, and all money back If not sat
isfactory. The stock was divided into
1,000,000 shares of two dollars per share.
The dividends were paid for a short
time of the money of the victims and
then the mines were conveniently
flooded on paper, and the dividend re
duced. This was but a step to other
excuses to avoid payment of dividends.
Inspector O'Connell learned that in
1898 Howe and Mrs. Ida Goldlng ob
tained a possessory title to the mines.
In 1902 their title elapsed under the
laws of British Columbia for non-pay
ment of fees and non-performance of
work. Howe has Bince been represent
ing in his circulars and letters that his
company owns the group of mines ab
solutely, Under date of January 28,
1904. Howe wrote to one of the stock
holders thus:
"We beg to inform you that by reason
of excessive inflow of water encoun
tered in the Grand Times Mines, devel
opment work has for the present been
suspended and every effort Is being ex
erted toward removing the flow. In
consequence of this unforeseen disas
ter the Yale Company has for the time
being been compelled to decrease divi
dends to two per cent per month. In
conformity herewith we inclose P. O.
M. O, for $2 30 dividend for this month.
Trusting to be able to transmit more
favorable news for February, we re
main, yours very truly, Stock Guaran
ty and Surety Co."
Howe was arrested yesterday by the
United States Marshal and his bonds
were fixed at $3000.

Joseph Weiner, house painter, resid
ing at 1215 Mission street, not only
denied his wife's acouautlon that he
failed to provide for his family, consist
ins of herself and their six-year-old
sen, Clarence, but also declared that
the was so recklessly fond of one Frank
Titfin, a teamster, that she had him fre
quently at her home, contrary to the
husband's expressed desire. Whereupon
the lady became wroth and told Judge
Mogan that she admired Mr. Tiffin
solely because of his genial tempera
ment, and that the only time she in
vited him to her home was when she
met him on the street and asked him
to take care of little Clarence while she
cooked dinner, she knowing that his
ability as an entertainer would keep
the child's attention distracted from
her while she prepared the midday
meal. More of the case will be heard
next Saturday by Judge Mogan.

- "Weakness."
I have ascertained by the clos-
est observation in ; thousands of
cases that only in rare instances
is Â» the general . constitution or
nervous system involved to any
I noticeable degree whatever, and
that "weakness" in : all its:
phases is merely a symptom of
prostatlc disorder. I Such cases
may show temporary improve- .
ment under stimulating pro-
cesses of treatment, but ulti-
mate ; relapse lis : certain to fol-
low â¢ such . methods. The only
radical cure is the removal of
abnormal local conditions, and
this I accomplish through care-
fully directed local measures.
My treatment is : entirely dis-
tinctive and , original and tbe
results I claim are . thorough
and permanent. No other phy-
sician employs my methods, or
even imitates my . success in
curing : .;
Varieocele
Many who are but slightly af-
flicted with varicocele " believe
that the trouble la of little con-
sequence. The opposite is true.
Varicocela is a disease of a pro-
gressive nature. As it advances,
nervous complications come,
power diminishes and the gen-
eral health is impaired. I cure
Varicocele in five days without
the use of a knife, ligature or
caustic, without pain and with-
out detention from business.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', SUNDAY. MARCH 5, 1905.
PROPOSED BILL A MENACE
TO THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL
WARNING TO THE ASSEMBLY
Andrea Sbarboro Sets Forth Views in
Open Letter to People.
Andrea Sbarboro, president of the
Italian Bank and of the Asti Wine
Company, believes that the building
and loan bill, which has passed the
Slate Senate, will prove of great in
jury to several of California's strong
financial institutions without corre
sponding benefit to the people in gen
eral. In the letter which follows he
has set forth his views on the situa
tion:
It la to be regretted that our State
Senators did not understand the work
ings of the proposed bill to protect
Investors In building And loan asso
ciations.
It is to be hoped that in the Assem
bly, where there are some members
of building and loan associations with
long experience, the bill will either be
killed or amended so as to protect the
people from being hoodwinked by
eharp schemers.
On page 2, line 30 of the bill Just
passed, loans are permitted to be made
to shareholders, members and others.
This removes the mutuality of the
building and loan associations and
greatly endangers their securities.
On the same page, line 42, reads
that shareholders shall be permitted
to withdraw their funds "when the as
sociation shall desire to repay the
same." This Is simply preposterous.
No man would put a dollar Into any
building and loan association if he
knew that he could not withdraw his
money when he desired, but could only
do so when the association would per
mit him.
Building and loan associations
should be nothing more than co-opera
tive savings banks, where the mem
bers could withdraw their funds at
any time as their wishes or necessities
might require.
Page 3, line 86, states that shares
shall mature at the par value of $100
(except as to corporations now exist
ing). This is inserted to deceive the
public, as all the meritorious "local"
building and loan associations mature
their stock at $200 per share, while
the speculative, so-called "nationals"
promise to mature their stock at $100
per share.
CAUSES COMPLICATIONS.
Page 4, line 98, says that stock may
be issued in the form of "installment
stock, prepaid stock, paid up stock,
permanent stock and guarantee
stock." Now this is such a complica
tion and confusion of accounts that
for the average secretary in country
towns it would be impossible to mas
ter. There should be only one kind
of stock issued, the original monthly
installment stock. There should be
only one way and one measure for all
stockholders alike.
On the same page, line 113, it
speaks about stock being "forfeited."
Xo honest "local" building and loan
association ever permits any stock to
be forfeited. If a member cannot
continue to pay his dues, after six
months, he is notified by the secretary
to call and receive whatever he has
paid into the association and the earn
ings due him.
Page 5, line 163, states that the as
sociation shall have power to charge
an entrace fee "not exceeding $1 on
each share." This innocent looking
article is one of the worst features of
the building and loan associations.
The $1 a share entrance fee is paid
to the glib traveling agent who goes
throughout the country to solicit for
members. It is only natural that this
man promises great things which are
impossible to be achieved by the legit
imate building and loan associations.
ADVERTISE THEMSELVES.
Legitimate building and loan asso
ciations only charge 10 cents a
share for entrance fee, which pays for
the passbook and printing. They do
not require traveling agents to go over
the country to solicit membership.
The members, when they find that
they are in a legitimate building and
loan association, speak of it to their
neighbors. One member brings in an
other and large associations are form
ed in this simple manner.
But still worse, after the victim
learns that he has Joined a get-rich
quick concern, he cannot withdraw his
money without losing all or a part of
the funds which he has invested. As
is proven, commencing with line 155,
which says, "but no fee shall be
charged on withdrawal in excess of
$1 per share on installment stock upon
which not more than thirty install
ments have been paid and been in
force not more than thirty months."
This shows that if a person sub
scribes for twenty-five shares of stock
he pays $25 entrance fee and in, say,
six months he will have paid at the
rate of sixty cent 3 per share, $15 per
month, $90. Upon his withdrawal he
not only receives no Interest on his
money but sustains an actual loss of
$25. Cases of this kind have come
to my observation recently as may be
seen by letters in my offce.
This Is the way that Installment
stock Is dealt with. What takes place
with prepaid stock, paid up stock, per
manent stock-and guarantee stock, the
Lord only knows. The proposed new
law does not give light on that sub
ject.
BELL IS DANGEROUS.
Again I repeat that any person either
through sickness or other cause, who
may desire to withdraw his money
from the building and loan associa
tion would receive at any time every
dollar that he has paid into the funds
of the corporation with a fair propor
tion of the interest accrued.
Evidently this new bill has been
I gotten up in a great hurry without due
i consideration, and there are numerous
J dangerous rules througout the bill
which would virtually wipe out of the
I State one of the most meritorious
; financial institutions for wage-earners
i ever Invented by man. Therefore, as
I we are nearing the end of the leglsla
[ tlve session, I would earnestly recom-
I mend that the Assembly reject the
' Senate bill.
For thirty years we have been doing
very well with the laws now in exist
ence. In this period of time over one
hundred million dollars have been
saved by wage-earnera and people of
limited means through the legitimate
building and loan associations. Of
this large sum, fifty million dollars and
over have been used In building homes
tor heads of families and nearly fifty
million dollars have been paid to with
drawn members who have had use for
their money to embark In commercial
enterprises or other ventures, which in
many cases have been the means of
laying a foundation for future Inde
pendence. Every member of an hon
est, well-managed local building and
loan association has always received
upon withdrawal every dollar paid in
together with a reasonable rate of in
terest.
OLD IvAW SUFFICES.
Therefore I would earnestly recom
mend to leave well enough alone, to
keep the present law on the statute
book, adding thereto only a few sim
ple amendments, as follows:
1. Any member desiring to with
draw a part or all of his or her stock
shall have the right to do bo at any
time by giving thirty days' notice of
such intention to withdraw and re
ceive all the money paid in, together
with a reasonable portion of such
earnings as may be declared by the
board of directors, provided that not
more than one-half of the monthly
receipts shall be available to pay
withdrawal members for that month.
All applications to surrender shail be
paid in the order in which they are
made.
2. No association in this State shall
charge any more than 10 cents per
share for entrance fee.
S. All the money received and dis
bursed by building and loan associa
tions shall be duly accounted for and
a report shall be delivered to each
stockholder at least once in each year.
This report shall show the total re
ceipts and disbursements for the year,
,the net assets and liabilities of the
association and a schedule showing
the amount which has been paid in of
the shares of each series; the amount
such shares has earned, its actual
book value and its actual surrender
value.
SUGGESTS REMEDY.
"With the adoption of these few
amendments and with the appoint
ment by our honest Governor of two
honest, competent, practical account
ants to fill the duties of building and
loan commissioners, or better still If
the supervision of building and loan
associations would be placed under
the care of the Bank Commissioners
by giving them the power to employ
two active, competent accountants, I
believe that our meritorious building
and loan associations would continue
in their useful career by inducing
wage-earners to be thrifty, frugal and
economical and build homes for their
families, thus helping to build up the
towns and cities of our great State.
Some of the papers have published
that the bill passed by the Senate was
a compromise between representative
"local" and "national" building and
loan associations. That Is not true.
Oil and water will not mix. The presi
dent of "local" building and loan as
sociations has informed me that he
did absolutely not approve the above
bill.
As the oldest building and loan as
sociation secretary in the State, with
thirty years of successful experience.
I believe that in the above remarks I
interpret the sentiment of every of
ficer of every honest building and loan
association in the State and the senti
ment of every one of its 50,000 mem
bers.
Scaly
scalps
Nine people out of every
ten have trouble with their
heads. Many of them
suffer from a species of
eczema, which forms a dry
scale upon the skin of
the scalp, popularly known
as dandruff.
If this condition be
neglected the hair follicle
loses all its vitality, the
hair becomes brittle and
falls out and baldness is
the inevitable result.
Coke Dandruff Cure has
proved to be the only
reliable cure for this 4
annoying condition. It
positively removes, with
one or two applications,
every trace of dandruff.
Faithfully used, it will cure
every diseased condition of
the scalp (except
constitutional blood
disorders), and will
produce a luxuriant, glossy
growth of hair after all
other remedies have failed.
This is a strong
statement and one which
we would not dare to make
if we were not in
possession of thousands of
grateful letters from people
in every walk of life, who
have proved, to their
intense gratification, the
wonderful powers of
Coke Dandruff Cure.
If you are annoyed with
any scalp trouble
whatever, get a bottle
to-day. Your druggist
will tell you the same story
of uninterrupted triumph.
Coke Dandruff Cure
contains absolutely nothing
of an injurious nature
and may be used on the
heads of the most delicate.

SCHOOLS THRIVE
IN OLD EGYPT
Frank Marston, the Normal
Trustee, Writes Interest
ingly of Education There
MANY SUBJECTS TAUGHT
Children Learning to Write
and Read Their Native
Language in Quaint Eooms
The interesting: letter printed be
low has been received by The Call from
Frank W. Marston. Trustee of the
State Normal school. Marston has
been traveling: in Egypt for some time
and has made the schools and educa
tional institutions of the ancient land
his special study:
"Editor Call: â During a comparative
ly recent period, very gTeat advances
have been made In educational matters
in the LÂ«uid of the Pharaohs. At pres
ent the Egyptian Government schools
are divided into Elementary, Primary,
Secondary and Professional schools.
"The Kuttabs are the Mohammedan
elementary schools. Here the Koran is
taught and the pupils receive lessons
In reading and writing: Arabic to enable
them to memorize the Koran. If the
teaching proves to be satisfactory,
these Kuttabs may receive Govern
ment grants based upon the average
attendance, but before this is received
the pupils must be taught arithmetic.
Children may attend these schools up
to the age of eight years.
"Private schools may come under
Government inspection by showing
that they meet Government require
ments as to standards, but the only
ones that receive grants are the ele
mentary schools or Kuttabs.
"The greater number of these Kut
tabs present a very primitive appear
ance.
"The rooms are dark with stone walls
and mud floors. Some have benches
without backs, but in many there are
no seats; both children and teacher
sit on the floor. The walffe are rough
and bare, without decoration. The
children repeat their lessons in classes
or singly, swaying their bodies as they
recite. They present a bright, keen ap
pearance and are furnished with tin
or wood slates and Arabic primers,
while the teacher has a rod to enforce
attention.
PRIMARY SCHOOLS.
"Pupils usually attend the primary
schools up to the age of twelve years.
Here they are taught reading and
writing in Arabic. Over 90 per cent
of the population of Egypt is Moham
medan, and this being the religion of
the country, the Koran is taught in all
the Government primary schools. The
study of English is compulsory In
these schools and includes reading,
writing, grammar, dictation, composi
tion, arithmetic, geography, history,
geometry and translation from Arabic
to English and from English to Ara
bic. The teachers are Arabs and
strenuous efforts are put forth by the
Government to train competent men
for this profession.
"All the teaching in the secondary
schools is in English and they occupy
a position similar to the American
high schools; the ages of the pupils
are from 12 to 16 years. The curri
culum is somewhat similar to that of
the high schools of America, with the
exception of the Greek and Roman
classics, which are not taught here.
What are known as free schools in
America are absolutely unknown in
Egypt, for here all pupils must pay
some fee for their tuition. The study
of the French language is optional,
and only a percentage of the pupils
in the secondary schools are studying
French.
"Although there are no free schools,
on the other hand it must be said that
the Government encourages the study
of the higher branches by giving
grants to puptls for the payment of
their expenses while engaged in their
studies for the profession of teaching,
medicine or technology. Professional
schools have been established for the
study of the law, technology, medi
cine and teaching. The stimulus to
education is not confined to the Gov
ernment or to the European residents,
for the wealthy Arabs are founding
and endowing private schools and ask
ing for Government inspection. The
Egyptian Government school system
has been established about twenty
years and at the present time there
are 9000 pupils attending the Govern
ment schools.
AMERICAN SCHOOLS.
"The social elevation of the people
of Egypt depends entirely on the up
lifting of the women of the country.
The American United Presbyterian
Mission was begun in Egypt in 1854,
and in addition to the work- of preach
ing the gospel it has established
schools all over the valley of the Nile.
In Cairo the Presbyterians have a
substantial building for the schools In
a central position. On the boya' side
they have over 300 pupils enrolled and
on the girls' side 3 SO pupils. The great
feature of this school is the girls'
boarding department, for they have
ninety girl boarders, of whom ten are
Mohammedans.
"In this school are to be found the
children of Copts and Hebrews, Greeks
and Romans, Mohammedans and Pro
testants side by side in the classes. The
first hour of the morning is devoted to
Bible study and then they take the
usual course of reading, writing, gram
mar, arithmetic, composition, history
and geography. These subjects are
taught in English and Arabic, with
both oral and written translations from
one language to the other. It was spe
cially interesting in visiting these
schools to see an Egyptian girl walk
up to the blackboard and there work
out a sum in English arithmetic. Also
in another classroom to see similar
work in Arabic. The pupils appeared
to be bright and intelligent and so de
voted to their work that the majority
were studying their lessons during the
recess. All the boarders are taught
housekeeping and cooking in addition
to the ordinary school 'subjects. The
dormitories are lofty and kept scrupu
lously clean, with large dining and sit
ting rooms.
"There are more than 13,000 children
attending the American mission schools

into a fitting highway for the nation
in its countless representative bodies
to march as an escort to its Presi

with the national colors.
The light and airy stands, conform

magnificent, by night, under the com

tremendous crowds wandered in fairy

OKU'S WARRIORS ARE IN HARRYING PURSUIT
OF FOE'S SHATTERED COLUMNS.
KUROPATKIN'S LEFT FLANK HOLDS
FAST TO MAIN LINE OF DEFENSES
RENNENKAMPFF'S COSSACKS STILL CHECK KUROKI
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUART
ERS, FRIDAY, March 3.â Late yester
day the Japanese occupied the second
line of the Russian right's defenses,
two miles north. Their line was taken
this morning also on the west bank of
the Hun River, four miles north of
Ghangtan. This completely turned the
Russian right flank. The Japanese fire
demoralized the Russians, who re
treated in disorder. Pursuit was con
tinued during the night. The Russians
are still retiring and General Oku's
army is advancing rapidly.
GENERAL KUROKI'S HEAD
QUARTERS, March 4.â Tne Japanese
have gained a signal victory beyond
the Hun River, defeating in detail two
divisions of the Russian Sixteenth
Corps, recently arrived from Europe,
with great slaughter and capturing
huge quantities of ammunition. The
Russians still hold their main line of
defenses.
The Russians, fighting stubbornly be
tween midnight and daybreak, made
four attacks in heavy force against the
contingent of Japanese which gained
their first line in front of Waitao
Mountain on Thursday night. The Jap
anese maintained their foothold and
repulsed the Russian attacks, inflicting
heavy losses upon the Russians. The
Japanese held the ground two nights
and one day in weatheY below freezing.
The morale of the Japanese troops is
splendid.
While still holding their main line of
defenses eastward of the railway along
the Shahke River, the Russians are In
a position requiring the highest gener
alship in order to tight a battle or re
treat without heavy loss. One of their
strongest positions is Wanpo Moun
tain, six miles east of the railway,
and a group of hills to the eastward.
The Japanese are to-day bombarding
these strongholds tremendously with
most of their heavy guns. It seems im
possible that the Russian positions will
long withstand such a weight of pro
jectiles as is being hurled against them.
General Kuropatkin has massed a
great army, his left, apparently believ
ing that the Japanese might success
fully attempt a flanking- movement
from Liaoyang. The main line of de
fenses, which it took four months to
perfect, crown the summits of steep
hills.
NEWCHWANG, March 4.â Arrivals
from the Mukden road report that the
Japanese are enveloping the city and
that its fall is imminent. A strong
force is moving southeast from Faku
mÂ»n. General Nogi is advancing north
along the Liao River.
The Japanese on Friday cut off a
Russian division, four sotnias of Cos
sacks and twenty-six guns, endeavor
ing to regain Mukden. The Russians
were routed and retreated toward Tie
Pass, abandoning their wounded.
The Japanese raid on Sinmintin drew
reinforcements from the Russian sta
tions on the Mukden trail to the city,
which is threatened. All the outposts
have been recalled to streiQgthen its
defense. At 10 o'clock this morning
the Russians encountered Japanese
scouts near Laopien, twelve miles from
Mukden. The Russians slowly advanced
two miles over a scrub covered plain.
They then encountered an increasing
force of Japanese, advancing In the
face of a driving dust storm. At close
range thirty guns began discharging
shrapnel at the Russians, who, becom
ing demoralized, were ordered to retire
to Tie Pass.
The Russian retreat, which began at
5 o'clock in the afternoon, developed
into a rout. The wounded were left on
the field. The Japanese were not In
sufficient force to envelop the Russians
and a running fight toward the north
followed. The Russians, It is reported,
lost five officers and 200 men killed. The
Japanese loss is unknown.
FUTTLOFF HTLL HOLrDS OUT.
Japanese Attack Is Repulsed With
Enormous Loss.
MUKDEN, March 4.â The Russians
are holding on desperately to their
positions.
All along the Shakhe River the roar
of battle is heard. The Japanese are
bucking the Russian line in a dozen
different places. It is difficult to tell
which are the real attacks intended to
be carried home and which the mere
demonstrations. An attack is now be
ing made by the Japanese seven miles
southwest of the Russian station at
Mukden. The enemy is attempting to
push north on both flanks.
Sinmintin is held by 10,000 Japanese
cavalry, which are being constantly
reinforced.

â¢i ;
For three days previous to the gen
eral attack the Japanese bombarded
the whole Russian line with heavy ar
tillery. The assault was then begun
and has lasted more than thirty hours.
Yesterday the Japanese Imperial
Guards made a desperate attempt to
capture Putiloff Hill, the supposed
key to the Russian position and other
fortified positions around Kwanshan.
The attack was made at daybreak,
under cover of a snowstorm. Putiloff
Hill had been terribly ripped and torn
by Japanese 11-inch shells, but when,
ifl the midst of a blinding whirl
wind of snow, the Mikado's men ad
vanced to the attack, the Russians,
who had been driven to shelter, re
turned to the trenches and poured de
structive volleys into the ranks of the
stormers.
Determined as was the Japanese at
tack the rapid fire of the Russians
drove the Mikado's guards back in
confusion with heavy losses. Time
after time they advanced on the
coveted position and several times the
opposing troops engaged In furious
bayonet melees.
When the snowstorm cleared away
the Japanese were retiring upon their
own lines and the Russians still held
Putiloff Hill.
Although the lighting has now been
in progress six days, the officers here
are mystified as to whether the actions
at the wings are not being demonstra
tions to facilitate the chief object of
the Japanese to break through the Rus
sian center or if it is Field Marshal
Oyama's intention to turn Mukden.
One of General Kuropatkin's staff of
ficers said:
'Oyama's strategy Is to break the
center and then inclose the wings and
compel a demoralized retreat, but un
til now the Japanese attacks against
tfie center have been only measureably
successful. Sallnpu, which is the key
to our position on the right flank, was
the scene of awful carnage last night.
The Japanese concentrated on It the
fire of more than 100 yuns and then at
tacked with the bayonet. According
to the reports coming in they were re
pulsed, and in a counter attack the
Russians captured seven machine
yuns."
Trains are leaving Mukden ceaseless
ly for the north with wounded men and
stores. ' â  ,
KI'KOPATKIX'S REPORTS.
Left Flank Repulses Repeated At
tacks by Japanese.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 4.â Two
lengthy dispatches received from Gen
eral Kuropatkin, dated March 2 and
March 3, respectively, detail the move
ments of troops In various directions.
The dispatch of March 2 says:
"The enemy adopted vigorous offen
sive taotics after conducting a turning
movement on our right flank before
the villages of Sakhotun and LlnÂ«ia
tun. After a strong preparatory can
nonade they attaoked, but wsra re
pulsed with great loss.
"The Japanese vigorously attacked
the Gaotu Paas position and took one of
our entrenchments, from which they
were dislodged by our counter attack,
but we finally abandoned this en
trenchment because it was entirely
destroyed.
"The Japanese to-day several times
attacked our detachments on the left
flank and at about 1 o'clock carried
the heights in the center of our posi
tion. Our troops, however, counter at
tacked, dislodged the enemy and gain
ed a footing on the crest of a neigh
boring hill.
"Our detachment near the village of
Kudlaca, after repulsing five violent
attacks and inflicting great loss, as
sumed the defensive."
The dispatch of March S says:
"The offensive movement commenced
in the evening of March 2 against the
Japanese occupying Sanlinpu and
neighboring villages was continued this
morning. At the same time reinforce
ments arrived at Mukden.
"Early this morning the Japanese at
tacked our positions on the left flank,
in the region of Kandolesan. more than
203 battalions participating. All the
attacks were repulsed with great loss
to the Japanese front ranks.
"The Japanese attacking our right
flank are dressed in the uniforms of the
Chembarsky regiment, which was
posted at Gaotu Pass.
"Our detachment on the left flank re

LOSSES ARE APPALLING.
Correspondent Says 70.000 Men Have
Already Fallen.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 4.â Tha
battle raging at the front has assumed
enormous proportions. Already one
correspondent places the Russian
losses at 30,000 men and those of the
Japanese at 40,000. It Is added that
the attempt to draw a net around Gen
eral Kuropatkin has not yet succeed
ed, but it is stated that the Japanese
from Sinmintin are attempting, by
forced marches, to cut thÂ«s Russian
line of communications.
General Kuroki, according to tha
latest reports, is stalled by the Rus
sian left, but the Russian center is
yielding slowly before the Japanese on
slaughts.
On Thursday, Field Marshal Oyama
shifted the weight to his left, seeking
to envelop the Russian right eight
miles southwest of Mukden. In tha
hand-to-hand fighting which followei
and continued for four hours the lass
or both sides was enormous.
But the moat serious news is the rÂ«
port that the Japanese attacking col
umn at Sinmintin, about thirty miles
west of Mukden, has divided, part of
it moving straight east to roll up tha
Russian right wing, while the other is
making forced marches north with the
evident purpose of cutting the Russian
line of communications with Tie Pass
and closing the line of retreat. Should
the operation prove successful, tha
Russian army might be surrounded.
During the fighting at Sanlinpu on
Friday the Russians were facing only
a division and a half of the four Jap
anese divisions in the Liao River vsJ
ley and with the utmost difficulty ra
pulsed these. Correspondents tele
graphing on Friday at midnight
prophesied a renewal of the flght
Saturday morning against a rein/oread
Japanese army. â¢
The War Office is guarding well tha
secret of the outcome of the fight and
no dispatches, official or otherwlsa,
were allowed to paas on Saturday. Tha
general staff declines to say whether
General Kuropatkin is standing sis
ground or is already retreating.
STEADY JAPANESE GAINS.

TOKIO, March 4. â It was announced
to-day from the headquarters of tha
Japanese armies in Manchuria that tha

KUROKI'S MEN CLOSING I3C.
So Close to Russian Trenches "Hurt
Gannon Are Useless.
GENERAL KUROKI'S HEAD
QUARTERS. March 4. â Tka Russian
artillery kept up a heavy fir* on the
Japanese guns most of the day and
also tired shrapnel at the attacking
forces. The Japanese are fathered
on the slopes so close to the Russian
trenches that in some places their ar
tillery cannot give the best support.
The Russians have largely abandoned
their method of vollfy firing. I
believed that the Japanese attack will
succeed.
Friday. March 3. â The hotly con
tested engagement waged since mid
night across the Shakhe River from
YVitosan was still progressing late
this afternoon, under conditions en
ruling sreat hardships upon the at

police management was perfect. It
was a royal highway upon which the
President early entered and proceeded
to the Capitol.
The Grand Army of the Republic, as
is its habit, insisted on acting as the
President's escort, and the President's
rate of progress to the Capitol was re
duced to the pathetic pace of men who
were fast approaching the scripture
limit of life. But the delay had its
compensations. Many thousands had

along the miles from the White House
to Capitol Hill/ where Congress was
concluding its labors. -,
The five minutes remaining at the
close of the session were given to in
augurating the Vice President.
When the strike of noon put an end
to the session little was known beyond
the fact that no important appropria
tion bill had failed. â¢ '
Then began the formal organization
of the new session in the Senate cham
ber. In the space of the little cham
ber were the official visitors, the Presi
dent and Cabinet in plain clothes; the
Err.bassadors and Ministers, gorgeous
in gilt braid and decorations; the Su
preme Court in deep black; the army
and navy in silver and gold and
swords; and last of all the members of
an adjourned House of Representatives
banked about the walls or crowded
into cloakrooms. Each of these grand
divisions of official life was announced
and saluted by the Senate rising.

his own term as President. He then
delivered his inaugural address, which
surprised his hearers by its brevity.
As thÂ»- ceremony closed he was again
greeted by the roaring cheers of the
immense throng.
Accompanied by his escort and fol
lowed by troops and civilian paraders,
he started for the White House. It
was the most perfect column that ever
marched in an inaugural parade,
though its numbers were less. General
Chaff.cc had insisted that a brigade of
the National Guard from each State
should be the maximum representation.
Never had there been so perfect a regu
lar army column in any previous na
tional pageant.
While the whole military column was
a marvel and a delight as indicated by
the continuing tornado of cheers where
it passed, there were elements of spe
ciai interest. The Ninth Cavalary, that
splendid colored regiment, received
marked attention. The crowds went
wild over the section of Rough Riders.
The scouts and the Porto Rico bat
talion excited intense interest. The bri
gade of cadet battalions from many
States organized by General Caffee, at
tracted universal attention and re
ceived unbounded applause.
The civic grand division of eight bri
gades in three divisions, made up of
over fifty organizations, was in every
respect better organized than ever be
fore.
BKIIJLIANT ILLUMINATION.
Turning from the pageant of the day,
the doubled population of the city dis
persed itself for the three imposing
spectacles of the night, the promenade
at the pension office, misnamed a ball;
the fireworks at the White House and
the dazsling street decorations. The
attendance at the ball was limited to
I2jm or 15,000.
The street decorations were viewed
by a solid marching column filling the
wide pavements of the avenue and the
street itself and reaching for two
miles and a half.
No such brilliant scene of decoration
and illumination was ever witnessed
before in this country or any other.
The dome of the Capitol stood white
against the darkness, the illuminations
of searchlights in the top of Washing
ton monument being visible for many
miles. The fireworks exceeded all pre
vious displays. There were no ordi
nary pieces. Rockets were discarded.
The set pieces were of large dimen
sions â Buch as a wheel moTe than a
hundred feet in diameter, a Presiden
tial piece 200 feet in length and a na
tional flag 300 feet long carried up a
thousand feet by balloons and there
developed in the sight of the city and
beyond.
The decorations of the ballroom suc
cessfully conformed to the agreement
that every inauguration should exceed
all previous efforts. All was accom
plished that could be effected by ex
tended masses of color, spreading
about and over the immense room and
its galleries, with miles of evergreen
vines, carloads of cut flowers, flags in
artistic combination, electric lights by
the thousands upon thousands and
electric pieces large and small.
The instrumental music and the
trained chorus of 500 voices filled the
vast building to its remotest recesses
with the perfection of musical attain
ment. In deference to Sunday all cere
monle* wopped at midnight, but It
was well toward morning before the
lights were turned down on the most
brilliant spectacle that Washington

casions. Till long after midnight thÂ«
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. MARCH 5, 1905.
CZAR'S PEOPLE
ARE OVERJOYED
ST. PETERSBURG. March 4. â The
imperial rescript announcing that Em
peror Nicholas had decided to convene
an assembly of elected representatives
of the people to elaborate and con
sider legislation has produced a won
derful impression. The war and the
battle below Mukden are forgotten.
The rescript is hailed by many as
a second emancipation proclamation.
The Ndvoe Vremya characterizes it as
Russia's happiest hour. The liberals
are amazed and in the flush of en
thusiasm are reading it as a recogni
tion of the elective principle and the
complete surrender of autocracy; but
discriminating people, while regarding
it as a great victory, realize that all
will depend on the manner it which
the reform is carried out.
They do not yet harbor the vision
of a great national assembly debating
all questions of state. According to
their view an entering wedge has been
made, but the fight between liberalism
and conservatism Is now transferred
to the commission- charged with the
elaboration of the reform and only by
keeping up the agitation do they be
lieve a real triumph is achievable.
Hoch Indicted for Murder.
CHICAGO, March 4.â Johann Hoch,
the multi-bigamist, has been indicted
by the Grand Jury for murder. The
specific charge on which the indict
ment was found is that Hoch mur
dered his last wife but one, Mrs. Ma
rie Walcker-Hoch
gathered thousands walked on Penn
sylvania avenue through long reaches
of fairyland.
A schemer is a man who points out
the silver of a cloud and then pro
ceeds to borrow your umbrella.

ARMY OFFICER'S
WIFE A SUICIDE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, March 4. â Brooding over
trouble v. hich had caused her hus
band to commence proceedings for di
vorce, Bessie, the young wife of Lieu
tenant Louis B. Chandler of th#
Twenty-fifth Infantry, shot herself in
the breast in her room in the Paxton
Hotel and died a few hours later.
Mrs. Chandler left ncr husband,
who is stationed at Fort Niobrara,
Neb,, a few days ago, intending to
visit her parents at Baltimore, Mary
land, accompanied by her six-year-old
son. She expressed a fear to a cham
bermaid in the Paxton Hotel that
something was to happen to her and
asked the maid to care for her child.
Then she told the whole story of her
love for another man, Captain Kirk
man, which had led her husband to
send her away from the fort, and ad
ded pathetically that although she had
her way in everything she was a most
unhappy woman.
Lieutenant Chandler was expected
to arrive in Oma'ha late this evening,
but, instead, he wired to an army
friend here requesting him to take
charge of his wife's body.
Mrs. Chandler came of a well-known
and wealthy Baltimore family.
Unfortunately the men who claim
that thÂ«* world owes them a living are
not preferred creditors.

LOSSES IN THE BATTLE OF MUKDEN
ALREADY TOTAL SEVENTY THOUSAND
Continued From Page 27. Column 7.
A large Japanese contingent which
crossed the plain directly west of Wito
san, in the darkness, succeeded in gain
ing the first line of the Russian
trenches, to the great astonishment of
the Russians. The Russians have since
been making a fierce resistance in the
second line of the trenches on the sum
mits of the foothills ana the Japanese
are attacking them spiritedly.
The night was bitterly cold and to-day
it was freezing and a thin film of snow
covered the earth. The Japanese are
obliged to wear the heaviest clothing,
which, with the cold and continuing
snow flurries, handicaps them.
KUROPATKIN IN DESPAIR.
Telegraphs That His Position Is Ex-
tremely Dangerous.
BERLIN, March 4.â A dispatch co the
Tagreblatt from St. Petersburg says:
"General Kuropatkin, in a telegram
which arrived here at 7 o'clock last
evening, said 260,000 Japanese had bro
ken through the Russian left wing and
that it was cut off from the remainder
of the army."
At 10 o'clock came another dispatch
from General Kuropatkin, which read:
"The Japanese are marching on Muk
den. My position is extremely danger
ous."
In Government circles here to-day
there was a conviction that General
Kuropatkin had been fully beaten, that
part of his army had been dispersed
and that the railroad north of Mukden
probably would be cut.

Court Rules That District Attorney
Cannot Further Delay
Her Trial.
NEW YORK, March 4.â "Nan" Pat
terson, who has once been tried on the
charge of having murdered Caesar
Ycung, must be given another trial by
May 1 or be released on bail. A de
cision to this effect was given to-day
by Justice Gaynor of the New York
State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on
an application by Miss Patterson's
counsel for a writ of habeas corpus
and review of her case on the ground
that she had been denied her constitu
tional rights to a prompt trial. The
Justice said:
"The woman, of course, is entitled to
a speedy trial. She has T>een tried, the
jury disagreeing, 6 to 6. It seems to
be doubtful If the District Attorney
will move her trial again. Unless he
does so, before May 1 next, let her be
discharged on bail."
What this country needs is a few
more people who are willing to prac
tice after they get through preach
ing.

attempts to sink the British steam
ship Carlisle last night, according to
a report current here, but were re
pulsed by the customs guards on
board the vessel, who fired upon the
sampans.
The steamship Carlisle, now lying
in Manila harbor, was towed thither
recently from San Miguel May. at the
southern end of the island of Luzon,
where she was lying disabled. She
was under charter to the Russian
Government to carry supplies frqm
Vladivostok to Port Arthur, but lost
her propeller, finally drifting to San

for assistance.

INAUGURAL ADDRESS RINGS
WITH A DEEP PATRIOTISM
Conscious of National Eminence, the President Is
Mindful of Our Solemn Obligations.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â The Pres
ident in his inaugural address spoke as
follows:
"My Fellow Citizensâ No people on
earth have more cause to be thankful
than ours, and this is said reverently
and in no spirit of boastfuir.ess in our
own strength, but with gratitude to
tht Giver of Good, who has blessed us
v.ith the conditions which have en
abled us to achieve so large a measure
o* well being and of happiness. To us
as a people it has been granted to lay
the foundations of our national life in
& new continent. We are the heirs of
the ages, and yet we have had to pay
few of the penalties which in old
countries are exacted by the dead
hand of a bygone civilization. We
have not been obliged to fight for our
existence against any alien race; and
yet our life has called for the vigor
and effort without which the manlier
and hardier virtues wither away.
"Under such conditions it would be
our own fault if we failed; and the
6uccess which we have had in the past,
the success which we confidently be
lieve the future will bring, should
cause in us no feeling of vainglory, but
rather a deep and abiding realization
of all which life has offered us; a full
acknowledgment of the responsibility
which is ours and a fixed determina
tion to show that under a free gov
ernment a mighty people can thrive
best, alike as regards the things
of the body and the things of the eoul.
OUR FOREIGN POLICY.
"Much has been given to us and
much will rightfully be expected from
us. We have duties to others, and
duties to ourselves; end we can shirk
neither. We have become a great
nation, forced by the fact of its great
ness Into relations with the other na
tions of the earth; and we must be

have as beseems a people with such
responsibilities. Toward all other na
tions, large and small, our attitude
must be one of cordial and sincere
friendship. We must show not only in
our words but in our deeds that we
are earnestly desirous of securing their
good will by acting toward them in a
spirit of Just and generous r recognition
of all their rights.
"But justice and generosity In a na
tion, as In an Individual, count most
when shown, not by the weak but by
the strong. While ever careful to re
frain from wronging others, we must
be no less insistent that we are not
v rouged ourselves. We wish peace,
but we wish the peace of Justice, the
peace cf righteousness. Ws wish it be

ever have cause to fear us, and no
strong power should ever be able to
single us out as subject for insolent
aggression.

tury and a quarter of its national life
1h inevitably accompanied by a like
growth in the problems which are ever
before every nation that rises to great
ness. Power invariably means both re
sponsibility and danger. Our fore
fathers faced certain perils which we
have outgrown. We now face other
perils the very existence of which it
was impossible that they should fore
see. Modern life Is both complex and
intense, and the tremendous changes
wrought by the extraordinary in
dustrial development of the last half
century are felt in every fiber of our
social and political being.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5. 1905,
"Never before have men tried bo vast i
and formidable an experiment as that
of administering the affairs of a conti
nent under the forms of a democratic
republic. The conditions which have
told for our marvelous material well
being, which have developed to a very
high degree our energy, self-reliance
and Individual initiative, have also
brought the care and anxiety insepara
ble from the accumulation of a great
wealth in industrial centers. Upon the
success of our experiment much de
pends, not only as regards our own
welfare but as regards the welfare of
mankind. If we fail, the cause of free
self-government throughout the world
will rock to its foundations, and there
fore our responsibility Is heavy, to our
selves, to the world as it is to-day and
to the generations yet unborn. There
is no good reason why we should fear
the future, but there is every reason
why we should face It seriously, nei
ther hiding from ourselves the gravity
of the problems before us, nor fearing
to approach these problems with the
unbending, unflinching purpose to
solve them aright.
OUR SPLLIXDID HERITAGE.
"Yet, after all, though the problems
are new, though the tasks set before
us differ from the tasks set before our
fathers, who founded and preserved
this republic, the spirit in which these
tasks must be undertaken and these
problems faced. If our duty is to be
well done, remains essentially un
changed. We know that self-govern
ment is difficult. We know that no
people needs such high traits of char
acter as that people which seeks to
gtyvern its affairs aright through the
freely expressed will of the freemen
who compose it. But we have faith
that we shall not prove false to the
memories of the men of the mighty
past. They did their work; they left
us the splendid heritage we now en-
Joy. We in our turn have an assured
confidence that we shall be able to
leave this heritage unwasted and en
larged to our children and our chil
dren's children.
"To do so we must show, not merely
In great crises, but In the everyday
affairs of life, the qualities of practical
intelligence, of courage, of hardihood
and endurance, and above all the
pewer of devotion to a lofty ideal,
which made great the men who found
ed this republic in the days of Wash
ington, which made great the men
who preserved this republic in the
days of Abraham Lincoln."
OX THE REVIEWING STAND.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â The Pres
ident, with Chairman Cortelyou of the
Republican National Committee, the
members of the Cabinet and the Con
gressional Inaugural Committee, with
General Chaffee and staff and General
Wilson, returned to the White House at
2 o'clock, and through the northeast
gate joined the ladies and children of
the family and the invited guests at
luncheon, which was served immedi
ately. Promptly at 2:45 o'clock the
Presidential party left the White
House and, walking across the lawn,
took their assigned places in the re
viewing stand, where a thousand or
more specially favored ones had pre
ceded them.
Occupying the most desirable seats
were the members of the diplomatic
corps, in court dress resplendent with
gold lace and jeweled orders. Seated
near the President in his box near the
center of the stand were Mrs. Roose
velt, Vice President and Mrs. Fair
banks, Miss Alice Roosevelt, Miss Ethel
Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt Jr.,
Kerxnlt Roosevelt, Secretary Loeb and
Mrs. Loeb; General John M. Wilson,
chairman of the inaugural committee;
Mrs. and Mrs. George B. Cortelyou,
Mrs. W. S. Cowles, Mr. and Mrs. Doug
las Robinson, Mr. and Mrs. W. Emlen
Roosevelt; Colonel Charles S.Bromwell,
military aid to the President; and
Commander C. J. Winsiow, naval aid
to the President
GALA PROCESSION PASSES ALONG
FAMOUS PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
Men of the Army and Navy Joined by Detachments
From Islands Form an Imposing Spectacle.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â President
Roosevelt led his inaugural parade in
quick marching time from the Capitol
to the White House. No President In
recent years has been as prompt In
moving from one end of the avenue to
the other. The weather was ideal, the
sky being clear, the sun warm and a
fair breese blowing. The President lost
no time in formalities. He descended
the steps, which were put in place In
front of the anaugural stand, and took
his carriage without re-entering the
Capito!. The inaugural march began at
1:20 o'clock and as the President's car
riage, followed by that of Vice Presi
dent Fairbanks and those of the mem
bers of the Cabinet, proceeded through
the Capitol grounds the vast throng
hastily placed itself on either side of
the line of march and cheered without
ceasing.
The procession moved slowly and
Mr. Roosevelt, In acknowledging the
salutations from either side, rose to
his feet repeatedly and with his silk
hat in his hand, bowed to right and
left. The buildings facing the Capitol
grounds through which the procession
passed were occupied to their full ca
pacity with cheering people who waved
flags and handkerchiefs. No incident
marred in the slightest degree the in
augural procession as it left the scene
of the inaugural address and pro
ceeded down past the Peace monu
ment and took its way toward the
White House on the broad avenue.
A SPLENDID PAGEANT.
The procession formed immediately
behind the carriages of the Presiden
tial party and in the order previously
arranged marched from the Capitol.
The splendid triumphal pageant, pre
ceded by a platoon of mounted police,
moved up the avenue amid the frantic
applause of the thousands who packed
the line of march on either side to view
the spectacular and public feature of
the day. The Fifth Artillery Band fol
lowed the police and in stirring time
led the on-coming marchers. The
more military character of the return
from the Capitol, as contrasted with
the march to the Capitol, was due, In
part, to the fact that the old veterans
who followed the President on foot
this morning bade him farewell at the
Capitol and their places were taken by
the mounted officers on the staff of the
grand marshal and their special aids.
Squadron "A" of the New York Na
tional Guard, in their brilliant uni
forms of blue, again formed the Presi
dent's personal escort, together with
the officers of the President's old
Rough Rider regiment. In contrast
with the khaki uniforms of the Rough
Riders was the regular army uniform
of Lieutenant Granville Fortesque, the
President's cousin, who went from the
Rough Riders into the regular army
after the war, but rode with his for
mer comrades.
Many times along the line of march

the President arose In his carriage and
lifted his hat. A broad smile lit up
his face and it was easy to see the
cheers of the admiring throngs greatly
pleased him.
The military grand division of thepro
cession came after the Rough Riders.
Major General James F. Wade, as
chief marshal, with a splendidly uni
formed staff, representing each staff
corps of the army, led the division.
Foremost in the line were the pets of
the army and navy, the West Point
cadets and the "middies" from Annap
olis, with the District of Columbia Na
tional Guard, which has come to be
looked upon as almost a part of the
regular army organization. The cadets,
headed by Brigadier General Frederick
Grant and under their own superin
tendent, Brigadier General Mills, ac
quitted themselves splendidly. There
was a diversity about their organisa
tion which' made It very attractive, for
It represented infantry, field artillery,
new mountain battery platoonÃ and
the cavalry, which makes West Point
famous throughout the world.
The midshipmen surprised every
body. Sailors are not supposed to be
good foot soldiers, yet beyond question
the two battalions from Annapolis, 700
strong, gave the West Pointers the
hardest contest they have had for first
place In a parade.
The boys in their navy blue, tightly
fitting Jackets and leggings, marched
with a precision that was wonderful
and were cheered at almost every step.
In their wake came the revenue
marine cadets, a new feature in the
inaugural parade and one* so attrac
tive as to be sure of retention in the
future.
The splendidly drilled engineers were
represented by the Second Battalion,
Major Burr commanding, and as the
men marched in files of twenty they re
ceived unlimited applause. The pick of
the army had been cheered for their
splendid procession so that, while the
representations from each branch of
the service was small, It was beyond
question the finest body of troops ever
gathered on Pennsylvania avenue.
TROOPS FROM AFAR.
The Signal Corps, the provisional
regiment made up of two battalions,
and the Coast Artillery, all had repre
sentatives. The men who handle the
gTeat guns at the sea coast fortifica
tions, in their spick and span uniforms
with brilliant touches of colors of
white, yellow, red, blue and green, typ
\ ifying the various branches of the ser
; vice, made a moving picture calculated
| to stir to its depths the lovers of the
j regular army.
Porto Rico was well represented in
: the parade. Major Thomas W. Griffith
; of the regular army commanded the
i battalion of the provisional regiment
; which came all the way from Its island
home to participate in the inaugura
tion. The crowds were quick to recog
â¢ nize them and were generous in their
applause of the excellent showing" these
troops made.
Even more inspiring, however. wÂ»i
the sight of the First Battalion of
Philippine Scouts. Major J. S. Johnson.
U. 8. A., commanding, who were cho
sen to represent the archipelago in the
first inaugural parade in which these
little brown men of the Far East have
participated. Only the American sol
dier who has served in the Philippines
knows how loyal has been the services
of these men for their new-found coun
try. It waa the expressed wish of the
President that they should be in this
parade, and the military precision with
which they marched up the avenue
showed that they appreciated the
honor.
About t o'clock the troops came to a
halt, the President having reached the
White House on schedule time and
gone to his official home for a hurried
luncheon. The men as they rested on
their arms along the broad avenue
seemed glad of the opportunity the
wait gave them to spruce up to pass in
review before their newly inaugurated
President
TWOSTEP ON THE ROOF.
All along the avenue stretched the
splendid pageant, the trimmings of the
uniforms and the steel of weapons
glistening in the sunlight. While at
parade rest the soldiers amused them
selves by watching the scenes along
the curb. Incidents of human interest
were many. On the top of a building
opposite the Postofflce Department a
young man and his girl danced a two
step to the rapid melody of "Back.
Back, Back to Baltimore," played by
one of the bands in the parade.
It was exactly five minutes before S
o'clock when the Philippine Scouts,
who were toward the last of the Sec
ond brigade, first division of the mili
tary grand division, resumed their
march and passed the PostofHce De
partment with as perfect a line as was
to be seen in the parade. Their progress
was marked by great cheering. With
its peerless band playing a martial air
and the men stepping like automatons,
the Provisional Regiment of United
States Marines, headed by Colonel Car
many and his staff, followed, led by a
soldiery man with an empty sleeve.
He was Captain Harry Leonard, who
left one arm on the battlefield of Tien
tsin when the American marines point
ed the way to all nations In the march
to Peking. The marines are always
popular and they were greeted with
tumultuous applause as they marched
proudly along.
REGIMENT FROM SHIPS.
The crews of the armored cruisers
Colorado and West Virginia made up
a full regiment, and not merely a de
tachment or two, as in the past. The
sailors wore their legglns and tried
their best to carry their carbines at the
regulation angle. The Third Battal
ion of Field Artillery, commanded by
Major Hoyle, with the men sitting mo
tionless on their caissons, gave the
public one of the first exhibitions of
the new army field gun. This weapon,
not bronzed or blackened as was the
old piece, but shining like silver,
mounted on its khaki-colored carriage,
was the center of Interest.
There may be cavalry in other armies
as good, but certainly no one ever saw
on this side of the world the superiorâ
or perhaps even the equal â of the gal
lant Seventh and Ninth squadrons,
which next moved up Pennsylvania
avenue sixteen files deep, their pen
nants snapping in the breeze. The Sev
enth rode bay horses as closely match
ed as bits of mahogany, save the last
company, which waa mounted on high
stepping black chargers. The black
men of the Ninth, mounted on their bay
steeds, had come all the way from
Kansas to do honor to the President
to whose aid they had come in his hour
of need in the bloody conflict on San
Juan Hill.
DRIVE TO THE CAFTTOIj.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â The
White House was astir earlier than
usual this morning, and after a hur
ried breakfast the Presidents house
hold began active preparations for the
day's Important events.
The time set for the assemblage of
the Cabinet and the Presidential escort
was 9:30 o'clock, but the arrivals be
gan nearly a half hour earlier. The
first to reach the White House was
Postmaster General Wynne* He was
soon followed by Attorney General
Moody, Secretaries Hitchcock, Hay,
Taft, Metcalf and Morton. Secretary
Shaw walked over from the Treasury
with Jacob Riis, a personal friend of
the President from New York. About
the same time Senator Spooner, Sen
ators Bacon and Lodge and Represent
atives Dalzell, Williams and Cram- !
packer, members of the Congressional
Joint Inauguration committee, arrived
In carriages.
In the meantime the troops to serve
as the President's escort had formed
on Pennsylvania avenue and the ad
jacent streets. At least two hours be
fore the time set for the President's
departure the square in front of the
executive mansion was densely packed
with an enthusiastic crowd, waiting to
wish the President godspeed. The
President entered his carriage, drawn
by four bay horses, and with a de
tachment of his old regiment, the fa
mous Rough Riders, commanded by
Colonel Alexander Brodie, riding on
either side as his personal escort, start
ed for the Capitol to take the oath as
the nation's chief executive. Squadron
A of the National Guard of the State
of New York and a detachment of
Spanish War Veterans, and a body of
United States army veterans alsu
formed a part of the escort and rode
in the rear of the President's carriage, i
CHAFFEE AT THE HEAD.
Lieutenant General Chaffee, with his
staff in full military dress and superb
ly mounted, preceded the President's
carriage by a short distance. The Pres
ident wore the conventional silk hat
and frock coat and aa he walked from
the White House door with brisk ath- j
letic step he seemed In the best of
spirits and perfect physical condition.
The President was seated in the rear
seat, and to his left sat Senator Spoon
er, while facing them were Senator
Lodge and Representative Dalzell.
Vtoa President-elect Fairbanks' car
riage followed the President'a. Fair- j
banks was seated with Senator Bacon '
and Representatives Crumpacker and
John Sharp Williams. Then came Sec
retaries Hay, Shaw, Taft and Attorney
General Moody.
In the fourth carriage were Secre
taries Morton. Hitchcock, Wilson and
Postmaster General Wynne. The fifth
and last carriage contained Secretary
Metcalf. Secretary Loeb. Colonel Brom
well. the President's military aid. and
Commander Winsiow. his naval aid.
ROUGH RIDERS AS ESCORT.
The Rough Riders, in servloÂ» khaki
aa they spurred their horses to posi
tions at the sides of the President's
carriage as it passed out the east gate,
showed by their bronzed faces, sinewy
figures and their careless grace and
ease In the saddle, the free life they
had led on the Western plains. These
men were chosen from the famous
Rough Riders whom the President had
lÂ»d up San Juan hill in the Spanish
war.
Out into Pennsylvania avenue to the
stirring strains of "El Capitan," the
Presidential cavalcade swept to a
mighty roar, which was taken up by
the thousands that lined the way to the
CapltoL As the President's carriage
wheeled into Pennsylvania avenue
proper he leaned far out to one side,
and shading his eyas with his band,
took a look down the avenue toward
the Capitol, whose mighty dome was
visible above the blue hare which en
shrouded the base. Turning to Sen
ator Spooner he called his attention
to the splendid sight.
The magnificent boulevard waa
cleared from curb to curb. Its full
width, and the President and his escort
were seen at their best. Lieutenant
General Chaffee, the hero of Peking.
the grand marshal of the day, accom
panied by Brigadier General John O.
Johnson, headed the general staff of
the army, the first time this splendid
body of military men ha* participated
in an iaauguraJ ceremony. Directly
behind the general came the color
guard, composed of four cadets from
the military academy and four mid
shipmen from Annapolis, sons of vet
erans of the North and South In the
Civil War, save one unique figure In
the person of Cadet Titus, who at
tained fame by being the first soldier
of the International armies to scale the
walls of Peking in 1900.
The staff was composed of sight of
ficers of high rank and they in turn
were followed by eight special aids
wearing blue silk sashes. Then came
the pick of the Empire State soldiery.
Squadron A, made up of merchants
and professional men and workers, all
splendidly mounted and preceded by
their own choice band. -â¢*
MARCH TO THE CAPITAX*
Behind the Rough Riders wÂ»rÂ» th*
carriages of the Vice President and
the Cabinet, and then came a reminder
of the past, a detachment of picked
veterans from the Grand Army of the
Republic, whose gallant step belled the
gray locks and spare form of the old
soldiers. They led a detachment of
veterans of the Spanish-American war,
of men who had taken part in the
famous march to Peking and of sol*
diers who had campaigned in the Jun
gles of the Philippines. Closing thÂ«
escorting column came veterans of the
regular army and navy, the whols vet
eran organization led by Major General
O. O. Howard of Civil War fame
The President and his escort maretl
along, the avenue at a foot paca, owing
to the presence in the column of thA
dismounted veterans, to the ' ! ;
monument at the east front of thÂ»
Capitol reservation. Wheeling Into
North B street, the column mor< <1
to First street, east, thence south and
west into the Capitol grounds on the
central roadway, the military aids
passing to the right and the d-rlllan
aids to the left of th* Washington
statue.
The President's carriage, surrounded
by his personal escort and precided by
Grand Marshal Chaffe* and the "color
glard." led the line of march at B
street and Delaware avenue, escorting
the Presidential party to the Senate
wing of the Capitol.

BURNED ALIVE
WITH THE DEAD
Accord to Ancient Custom
Widow in India Dies Upon
Funeral Pyre of Husband
Special I>!soatch to ThÂ« Call.
BOMBAY, March 4. â Despite all
efforts of the Indian Government to
â¢'tamp out the horrible practice of
burning widows alive on the funeral
pyres of their husbands, in remote dis
tricts the "settee,** an the fanatical
riie is called, is still practiced occa
sionally with . all the .â¢'. accompanying
ceremonies prescribed by ancient tra
dition. Of this a gruesome Instance
ha 3 Just come to light which shows,
incident?]]?-, that the atrocious sacrl
f.< c :p still regarded as a praiseworthy
act of piety by many Hindoos and but
for the heavy restraining hand of
British authority would probably
again become common.
A while ago, Chaudhri Missir, a
Brahman who had held firmly to the
faith of his fathers, di^d in the vil
lage of Sanchari, situated in a district
where the occasional visits of the tax
collector are the only evidences of for
eign domination with which the in
habitants are acquainted. His rela
tives wished to give him an old fash
ioned funeral worthy o? one who had
been no scrupulous in the observance
of all the ceremonials of his religion,
and his widow was apparently nothing
Joth to offer herself as a sacrifice.
WIDOW A WILLING VICTIM.
Arrangements were accordingly
made for the cremation together of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1905.
the living and the dead on the banks
of a small river. Some ground was
staked off In the form of a St. An
drew's cross, on which the funeral
pyre was built. After the body of the
dead man had been laid upon It the
widow bathed in the river and then,
adorned as for a marriage, seated
herself on the pyre alongside of her
husband's corpse and called upon her
son, Juggernath Missir, to perform his
filial duty as a devout Hindoo.
In the presence of a vast crowd
which had assembled, Juggernath
lighted some wheat stalks, and, after
walking three times around the pyre,
applied the lighted ends, as custom
prescribes, to the mouth of the dead
man. This failed to ignite the pyre,
however. Then four Brahmans â
Balkishun Missir, Dwarka Missir, Ram
Charan Missir and Lachraan Tewari â
the three former relatives of Chaudhri
Missir, performed the "Humad."
This consisted in the burning of in
cense and the placing of lighted chips
of wood that had been dipped In
melted butter beneath the pyre. Mean
while the widow, seemingly absorbed
in a pious ecstacy, gave no sign of
fear. Just before the flames reached
her she stood up and turned to the
setting sun, but immediately fell back
on the pyre, apparently overcome by
the heat and smoke. If in her agony
6hc uttered any cries they were
drowned by the shouts of the fan
atics, the clashing of cymbals, the
beating of drums and the tooting of
the sank shells. And thus her ashes
mingled with those of her husband.
PRINCIPALS IMPRISONED.
The authorities learned of the af
f&ir and started an investigation. They

GIVEN RING BY HAY.
President Receives Ornament With
Jjock of Lincoln's Hair.
WASHINGTON, March 4. â On the
third finger of his left hand during
the inaugural ceremonies President
Roosevelt wore a heavily embossed
seal ring. The ring was a present to
President Roosevelt this morning
from Secretary of State John Hay. In
stead of a seal on the oval flat sur
face of the ring is a receptacle with
a glass face. Under the glass is a lock
of hair from the head of Abraham
Lincoln, taken just after his assassin
ation and before his death.
While in his room and waiting for
the ceremonies in the Senate cham
ber to begin, .President Roosevelt
called attention to the ring. Secre
tary Hay, he said, had given It to him
with the expressed wish that it should
be worn during his Inauguration.
"I am very happy to wear it," added
the President, "and shall always value
it very highly."
The ring is very like in pattern to
the one which Roosevelt wears on the
little finger of the same hand.

FAIRBANKS GIVEN THE OATH
BY FRYE IN SENATE CHAMBER
Indianan Makes Brief Address and at Once Assumes
the Duties of Office of Vice President.
WASHINGTON, Mar. 4.â ln the pres
ence of as many of his fellow citizens
as could be crowded into the Senate
chamber, Charles Warren Fairbanks
was at high noon to-day Inducted into
the office of Vice President of the
United States. The ceremony was
quickly followed by the final adjourn
ment of the Senate of the Fifty-eighth
Congress, the beginning of a special
sesaion, an address by the Vice Presi
dent and the swearing into office of al
most a third of the membership of the
Senate. All these official acts took
place in_ the chamber Just before the
inauguration of the President and
were in reality, while themselves of
great import, the prelude of the more
Important event.
The Installation of the new Vice
President was severely simple, and as
brief as simx>le. It consisted of a
promise, solemnly made with uplifted
hand and bowed head, to perform the
duties of the office and to support and
defend the constitution of the United
States. This was the oath of office and
it was administered by Senator Frye
as president pro tempore of the Sen
ate. The two officials stood facing
each other on the elevated platform on
which rests the desk of the presiding
officer of the Senate, practically on the
same spot on which all the Incoming
Vice Presidents for the last fifty years
have stood-
A GALA ASSEMBLAGE.
Plain and democratic though the cere
mony was, It attracted to the Benate
a gathering of notable people, many of
them of such importance that, in ac
cordance with time honored custom,
their appearance wai heralded with
pomp sufficient to atone for the sim
plicity of the official acts of the occa
sion, if not to quite overshadow them.
These guests Included the foremost
representatives of the official life of the
capital city, foreign and domestic, civil
and military, and also many other per
sons of prominence from all parts of
the country.
On the Senate floor with the Cabinet
were the President of the United States,
himself about to be Inaugurated; the
diplomatic corps, the Supreme Court
of the United States, the memberÃ of
the House of Representatives, the lieu
tenant general of the army, the Gov
ernors of States and others distinguish
ed by reason of position or achieve
ment. These sufficed to tax the capac
ity of that part of the hall, and they
were splendidly supplemented and sur
rounded by the attendance in the gal
leries, consisting in large part of thÂ«
' wives, relatives and friends of the men
\ who occupied seats below, many of
them as distinguished In private and
social life as the others in the public
Bervice.
GALLERIES LEND COLOR.
Practically all the variety of hue
' and vivacity of scene came from thÂ«
jralleries, for aside from the decorations
worn by the foreign representative*
and the gold lace with which the uni
forms of the few army and navy offi
cers present were decorated there was
, a dull level of black and brown on the
| first floor. This monotony was relieved
somewhat in the background by a
! sprinkle of gold on the gray walls of
' the chamber, but it was not sufficient
' to compensate for the absence of ani
; mation which only the ladies, with their
i flowers and ribbons and feathers, could
I contribute.
The section of the gallery usually de
voted to the private use of Senators
was to-day entirely surrendered to
w hat may be called the executive party,
and was occupied by the families and
immediate friends of the President and
the Vice President and of the members
of the Supreme Court and the Cabinet.
The front row of seats on one side of
this section was filled by the members
of the President's household and the
corresponding row on the other side by
those of the Vice President. Mrs.
Roosevelt and the wife and mother of
Vice President Fairbanks were pres
ent.
HALL NOT OVERCROWDED.
The diplomatic gallery, which is
rarely occupied by more than two or
three persons at a time, was crowded
to-day by the wives of representatives
of the various foreign embassies and
legations, all manifesting much eager
ness to witness the ceremony. Direct
ly opposite that quarter numerous
members of the newspaper fraternity
occupied their usual places In the
press gallery, most of them diligently
engaged in portraying the interesting
scenes about them. Other portions of
the gallery were given over to persons
holding Bpecial tickets. Every niche
and cranny was filled, but the careful
prearrangement which limited the
number of tickets to the exact capacity

of thÂ« hall prevented unseemly crowd
ing
The gallery visitors were practically
all :In their seats before the official
guests began to make their appear
ance. This circumstances, was due to
the fact that while the officials were
detained until a specified time, the gal
lery : doors were j opened at 11 o'clock
and ticket-holders permitted to ( enter
any time thereafter. They found none
or. the star performers In their as
signed places, if Senators may be ex
cepted, but the wait was not long, and
in the meantime the gallery visitors
easily devised â  entertainment among
themselves. The Senators, many of
them . showing fatigue as the result of
recent long hours of labor, were
grouped together completely on the
Republican side of the chamber, -an
arrangement made necessary to make
room for other dignitaries?-
ARRIVAL OF NOTABLES.
The two big, round-faced gold
decks, which front from the north and
south walls of the Senate chamber,
had measured the time up to 11:45
o'clock when the first of the special
guests arrived. These were the mem
bers of the House of Representatives,
They had marched over in a body to
the quarters of the Senate through
the long corridor from their own hall
at the other end of the Capitol, headed
by their redoubtable leader, Speaker
Cannon, with all the assurance of an
Invading army, and when the south
doors of the Senate chamber swung
open and Assistant Sergeant at Arms
Leyton announced, "the Speaker of
the House of Representatives," they
walked proudly to the seats assigned
them on the Democratic side of the
chamber, accepting as their due the
honor done them. Upon the stroke of
the gavel of the President pro tern.,
the Senate and Its visitors rose as one
person to welcome them.
The Speaker had scarcely taken his
seat at the side of the presiding officer
and Senators and guests had not more
than resumed their chairs when the
doorÃ again parted and Alonzo H.
'Stewart, another assistant sergeant at
arms, heralded in genuine feudal style
the approach of the diplomats, headed
by Count Cassini, dean of the corps.
DIPLOMATIC CORPS ENTERS.
"The Embassadors and Ministers
Plenipotentiary," he said In ringing
tones, and again, upon the fall of the
gavel, all came to a standing posture,
while Sergeant at Arms Ransdell es
corted the foreign dignitaries to their
places, fronting the presiding officer.
The foreigners attracted much atten
tion, and the brilliancy of their dress
and the distinction of the gentlemen
themselves were the subjects of much
admiring comment
Events followed quickly. From this
time until Senator Fairbanks began
his address the Senators and their
visitors were kept constantly engaged
in rising to receive newcomers. The
Ministers were followed . by the Su
preme Court, officially gowned In long
robes and with Chief Justice Fuller,
distinguished in appearance, leading
the van. The judiciary was In turn
succeeded by Lieutenant General
Chaffee, chief of staff, and his aid.
Gradually the hall was filled and
the scene had become more and more
animated, until for the last time In
connection with the occasion the doors
were opened to admit a guest. He
was the guest of guests â the Presi
dent â the President and the Presi
dent-elect, Theodore Roosevelt.
PRESIDENT TARES SEAT.
"The President and his Cabinet,"
proclaimed Sergeant at Arms Rans
dell In well modulated phrase.
Again all were their feet, and
again was attention sharply fixed. In
the entire assemblage there was com
paratively few who could not boast
personal acquaintance with tht chief
executive, hut this fact did not pre
vent a general craning of necks to ob-
Berve him on this, the crowning oc
casion in his career. All eyes were
turned upon him as, accompanied by
the Congressional Committee and the
members of the official household, he
walked down the center aisle of the
chamber In the wake of the convoying
sergeant at arms, who placed him In a
big red leather chair Immediately in
front of the presiding officer's desk,
where, himself an Interested spectator,
and flanked by the committee on ar
rangements, he sat facing the other
spectators. He had gone directly to his
seat, looking neither to the right nor to
the left, but evidently never unmind
ful of the eplendid scene about him.
He had once before been a partici
pant in an inaugural ceremony, but
then only as the recipient of second
honors. He was there now as the head
of the people of the nation, and by
right of their choice. His manner was
that of a man who appreciates re
sponsibilities and at the same time
feels capable of assuming them.
FRYE CLOSES SESSION.
The chief executive had very little
time for reflection. Inauguration time
had arrived. The man who had shared
with him the honors of the last elec
tion had been ushered in in the person
of Senator Fairbanks, and was even
now standing where on the fourth of
1 March, 1901, Mr. Roosevelt himself had
stood, to take the oath of the Vice
Presidential office. Senator Fairbanks
had been escorted by the committee
on arrangements to the Dlatform on
which sat President pro tempore Frye
and Speaker Cannon, thÂ« former of
whom was on the eve of performing
the last act of his present term In that
office by administering the oath which
would make Fairbanks not only Vice
President, but also the permanent pre
siding officer of the Senate.
Senator Frye does all things with
promptness and decision. The two
official timepieces were agreed in pro
claiming the hour of 12, when, accord
ing to the requirements made and pro
vided, the fifty-eighth Congress must
come to a close, the fifty-ninth Con
gress be started on its career, and the
new presiding officer introduced and in
stalled.
FAIRBANKS TAKES OATH.
Frye had already said farewell; the
visitors were in their seats. Not a mo
ment waa lost. Rising in front of the
slender and towering form of his suc
cessor, the President pro tempore re
peated to him in the form of an offi
cial oath the few impressive words
which transformed the Indiana leader
from the position of a Senator to that
of Vice President of the United States.
The ceremony did not consume more
than two minutes of time, but it was
conducted with such dignity and sol
emnity as to make a lasting impression
on all present. Profound stillness
characterized the dense assemblage
while it was in progress, none present
apparently failing to appreciate that
an act of sacred national import was
being performed.
The oath concluded, the two lead
ing participants shook hands cordially
and Frye spoke a few hurried words
of congratulation. With a last posi
t've thump of the gavel the Maine
Senator relinquished his position as
President pro tempore by announcing
the final adjournment of the Fifty
eighth Congress. Without a look
backward h*> vacated the seat he had
occupied for almost four years,
stepped from the presiding officer's
platform to the Senate floor and there
took his seat to listen with other Sen
atcrs to the address of the new Vice
President.
INAUGURAL SPEECH.
Fairbanks had no difficulty In being
heard. He spoke deliberately and dis
tinctly, his voice, bo well tried during
the past campaign, easily reaching all
parts of the chamber. He said:
"Senators: I enter upon the dis
charge of the duties of the position
to which I have been called by my
countrymen with grateful appreciation
of the high honor and with a deep
sense of its responsibilities.
"I have enjoyed the privilege of
serving with you here for eight years.
During that time we have engaged In
the consideration of many domestic
questions of vast importance and with
foreign problems of unusual and far
reaching significance. We submit
what we have done to the impartial
judgment of history.
"I can never forget the pleasant re
letions which have been formed dur
ing my service upon the floor of the
Senate. I shall cherish them always
as among the most delightful mem
ories of my life. They warrant the be
lief that I shall have in the discharge
of the functions which devolve upon
me under the constitution the gener
ous assistance and kindly forbearance
of both sides of the chamber.
"We witness the majestic spectacle
of a peaceful and orderly beginning of
an administration of national affairs
under the laws of a free and self-gov
erning people.
"We pray that divine favor may at
tend it and that peace and progress,
Justice and honor may abide with our
country and countrymen."
SENATE ORGANIZES.
The address received careful atten
tion, and at Its conclusion the Vice
President instructed the secretary of
the Senate to read the President's call
for an extra session of the Senate. The
reading accomplished and the Senate
of the Fifty-ninth Congress thus In
stalled, Dr. Edward Everett Hale, the
venerable chaplain of the Senate, came
forward to deliver the opening prayer
of the first session. In response to a
quiet signal from the chair the Sen
ate and its guests arose and stood while
Dr. Hale, in his usual impressive man
ner, utter the Invocation.
The organization of the Senate was
then completed by the swearing In of
Senators elected to serve for the next
six years. They appeared in platoons
of four in alphabetical order at the
desk of the Vice President, each being
accompanied by his colleague. The oath
was administered by Fairbanks and in
each case was Immediately followed by
signing the Senate roll of membership.
This ceremony concluded the day's
session, and the Senate adjourned to
the outside platform to witness, with
others, the inauguration of President
Roosevelt.
The official guests left the chamber
in order the reverse of that in which
they had entered, and were closely fol
lowed by the visitors In the galleries.
The arrangement for exit was excel
lently contrived; the departure was
without confusion or disorder, and only
a few minutes were required to clear
the hall.
ENTERS THE CAPITOL.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â As Presi
dent Roosevelt entered the Capitol
building by the long flight of marble
steps to the eastern wing, he paused
several times to turn and raise his hat
to the cheering throng, which reached
far back across the fine asphalt drive
way. There were so many carriages

The carriage which bore Vice Presi

that of President Roosevelt and he, too,
was cheered. Fairbanks was as gra

proceeded to the Capitol. A squad of
Capitol police, headed by Sergeant-at-

the marble room adjacent to the Presi

Senator Fairbanks avoided the party

SEA IN MIDDLE

Heavy Eains in Arizona
Cause Reappearance of
Body of Water at Salton
Bpecl&l Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 4. â The con- i
dltlons which caused the famous Sal
ton Sea in 1891, when the great basin
of which Salton is the center was
covered with water and an inland sea
was formed, have been repeated in
that territory and if they continue
practically all that desert section will
be inundated within a few days.
The famous Salton Sea attracted at
tention from all parts of the country
and was the subject of scientific in
vestigation by some of the leadinjf
Eastern universities.
For more than a year the formation
of this great body of water was not ex
plained, and then it was found that the
overflow came from across the Mexican
border, the water following tha.t low
valley which is at places far below the
level of the sea. The overflow was
caused by torrential rains along the
Colorado River and by cloudbursts
along the Gila River, causing such a
volume of water that the Colorado was
not large enough to carry It off.
During the last few weeks there !
have been phenomenal rains through
Arizona and upon the Colorado and
Mojave deserts, and once more the :
flood In the upper Colorado River has
been met at Yuma with flood in the
Gila, raising the water level to the ,
point reached in 1891.
On the Colorado desert itself in the '
last few days there have been such
rains as never before were reported.
Calexico reports a precipitation of two
Inches in two hours. At Imperial
water flowed a foot deep through the
streets and no one ventured out of '
doors.
To what depth the wate* will rise
cannot be predicted, nor can it be stated
what the damages will be, but there
are thousands of acres now under
water, most of it land which at the
time of the overflow probably had
never been visited by white men.
Charles J. Glidden of England, who
drove a motor car across the Arctic â 
circle, is now on his way to the
Antipodes, and will endeavor to drive
to the most southerly point yet reached ;

CRACK CRUISER SQUADRON OF ENGLAND
TO PAY VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES
Rear Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg, Who Married
Granddaughter of Victoria, to Be in Command.
LONDON, March 4. â Prince Louis
of Battenberg is going to pay a visit
to the United States shortly and his
presence there is certain to arouse
much interest. For, in spite of the
fact that his Serene Highness, as he
st'-ll is called, is a German by birth, he
Will go to America as a rear admiral
of the British navy, in command of
the most formidable and fastest squad
rcn that ever has called at the ports
of the United States on a peaceful
mission.
Prince Louis was a Hessian before
he became a British subject. He is
the last of three brothers, in whom the
late Queen Victoria took a motherly
Interest. The youngest of them. Prince
Henry of Battenberg, who died in
1Â£96, married the Queen's youngest
daughter. Princess Beatrice, while
L^uis became the husband of her fa
vorite granddaughter, Princess Vic
toria of Hesse. The youngest of his
wife's sisters married the Czar of Rus
sia; another is the wife of the Kaiser's
brother. Prince Henry of Prussia â
Germany's sailor Prince â and a third
Is the widow of Grand Duke Sergius
of Russia.
A? far as cash and titles are con
cerned. Princess Victoria made any
tr'ng but a brilliant match when she
wedded Prince Louis, for he possesses
only a castle and a small estate in
Hesse and has not much money be

gets far more enjoyment out of life
than any of her Bisters. Had Prince
Lcuis never married her it is question
able "whether he would now be a rear
admiral with one of the finest cruisers
in the British navy as his flagship, but
he has fairly merited his rank by sheer
hard work and demonstrated ability.
A THOROUGH SEAMAN.
Of course, influence has helped him,
but he has mastered his profession in
the most thorough fashion and has
proved equal to every duty with which
he has been entrusted. Though his
family was German, he was born at
Gratz. Austria, in 1554.
Marryatt's sea yarns fired his boyish
imagination with a desire to be a sail
or, and his folks, seeing there was
small chances that he would ever
amount to anything as a German
princelet, shipped him off to England
where he obtained a cadetship in the
navy at the age of fourteen. No spe
cial Quarters were assigned to him: he
had to be content with a very mod
erate allowance of pocket money and
fared just like the ordinary midship
man. He learned his seamanship In
the days of masts and sails, before it
had ever entered anybody's head that
a Jack Tar should be a mechanic. He
was an officer of the watch on the old
frigate Inconstant that went around
the world under sail, but he was
among the first to recognize that can
vas is merely an incumbrance to the
modern steam warship.
Ho was made a sub-lieutenant in
1874 when he was twenty and a lieu
tenant two years later. That was still
his rank when In ISS4 he married the
Queen's granddaughter. Thereafter
his promotion was not so rapid as to
afford an*, good ground for the com
plaint that he owed It to the petticoat
influence of a royal alliance. He was

made a commander a year after his
marriage, but six years elapsed before
he became a full fledged captain. For
the last few years he has been the
Director of Naval Intelligence, a post
of great importance, the duties of '

tion and equlqment, and In general
finding out what the other powers are
doing so as to be able to keep ahead
ok- them. It was not until a few |
months ago that he was gazetted a !
rear admiral.
HIS BAPTISM OF FIRE.
He has not seen much actual sea
fighting, for the British navy has af
forded scant opportunities for that ex
perience in recent years. It was at
the bombardment of Alexandria, where
Lord Charles Beresford so conspicu
ously distinguished himself, that
Prince Louis received his first and
only baptism of fire. He was then 'in
command of a grattling battery. His ;
reputation for tactical skill was es
tablished at the Mediterranean ma
neuvers in 1902, when by a clever ruse
he managed to outwit the make-be
lieve hoatile fleet and escaped with a
whole squadron from Argistole.
As a naval officer he belongs to the
progressive scientific school, of which
Admiral Sir John Fisher â "Jackie"
Fisher in the service, now the firat
sea lord of the Admiralty â is at the
head. In conjunction with Captain
Scott, Prince Louis invented the first
system of long distance signaling on
shipboard, which immensely Increased
the scouting capacity of a fleet at sea.
Another valuable Invention of his in
general use in the royal navy is a
course indicator â a device by which
the officer of the watch can determine
the course and bearing of the other
ships of a fleet.
Now in his fifty-first year, he is a

tall, active, handsome, black bearded
officer. Thoroughly absorbed in his
profession, he gives himself no airs
on account of his title, and while he
is a strict disciplinarian and will tol
erate no slackness, he is far from be
ing a martinet and is popular with
both officers and men. The nickname
"Batts," which was somewhat con
temptuously bestowed upon him when
he entered the service, still sticks to
him, but is now regarded as a term
of endearment among his colleagues.
He ceased to be considered a "bloom-
Ing foreigner" long years ago.
FLEET OF FINE SHIPS.
Prince Louis' flying 1 squadron will
consist of the six first-class armored
cruisers Drake, Berwick, Cumberland,
Cornwall, Essex and another vessel of
the "county" class, yet to be selected.
They all have a speed of twenty-three
knots, which is one knot greater than
any cruiser in the United States navy,
and represent Britain's latest achieve
ments in this type of warship. The
flagship, the Drake, which was launch
ed in 1901, has a displacement of 14,
100 tons. Her armament consists of
two 9. 2-inch guns; sixteen 6-inch
quick-firers, fourteen 12-pounders and
twelve small rapid-flrers. She has in
addition two torpedo tubes and is pro
tected by a belt of six-inch Krupp
steel. She is in reality a combination
or the battleship and cruiser and an
enormously costly vessel. There are
three other similar ships in the Brit
ish nayy â the King Alfred, Leviathan
and Good Hope.
The five other cruisers of the squad
ron are of 9800 tons displacement.
They are armed with fourteen 6-inch,
twelve 12-pounders and thirteen
smaller guns, while their armor plat
ing is only four inches thick. By
American naval experts their arma
ment would be considered unduly light
and as fighting machines they are not
equal to the Brooklyn or New York,
of about the same tonnage, which were
launched several years earlier, al
though being one knot faster, they
could leave them astern.
In gun power the ships of the
American navy are generally superior
to those of similar size and type in
the British navy. This disparity has
aroused much hostile criticism here
in the past but in the future com
parisons in this respect will not be so
unfavorable to the British ships.
There are several cruisers now build-
Ing which, with practically the same
displacement as the Drake, will mount
six 9.2-inch guns, as against her two,
and the secondary battery' of 6-inch
guns will be reduced to ten.
The cruise of Prince Louis' squad
ron, which will last eight months, is
the first that has been arranged since
the recall of weak, non-fighting ships
from distant waters and typifies the
new spirit which "Jackie" Fisher has
brought into the Admiralty. Ameri
cans, who will not allow themselves
to be outdone in anything, are certain
to welcome an opportunity to repay
the splendid hospitality shown Amer
ican officers when an American squad
ron last visited these waters. It will
be lecalled that on that occasion the
officers were entertained by the King
at Buckingham Palace.
It has not yet been decided definite
ly when the squadron will start, but
as at present arranged it will be some
time early this month, and a tour will
be made of the Mediterranean before
crossing the Atlantic.

"Please deny most emphatically the
allegations of my husband. W. E. Hoi

UNCLE SAMUEL
A SPENDTHRIFT
All Eecords for Extrava
gance Are Broken by the
Fifty - Eighth Congress
epeclal Dispatch to Tee Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. March 4.â A1l records
in extravagance have been broken by
the Fifty-eighth Congress, which came
to an end to-day. The total appropria
tions of the two sessions amount to
51,699,661,288. Eren the Fifty-fifth Con
gress, which provided funds for the
Spanish-American War, did not spend
bo much by $21,000,000.
Uncle Sam has become a confirmed
spendthrift. It is fortunate there is
an available cash balance In the treas
ury. It is likely to be needed. Leaders
admit that what Speaker Cannon calls
the "gap between the trousers and the
waistcoat"â that is, the expenditures
above receiptsâ is more than $92,000,000.
They deduct from this appropriations
of $30,000,000 for bank nore redemption
and sinking fund appropriations and
assert that the deficit is only $9,000,000.
It is largely a matter of bookkeeping.
Representative Littleneld of Maine,
who criticized the extravagance, has
prepared a statement comparing ex
penditures of the Fifty-eighth Con
gress with those of the Fifty-fifth, or
"war Congress." He estimates the de
ficit at $92,000,000.
AN AFTOPSY SHOWS THAT
MTTRDER WAS COMMUTE!
Shot Is Found in the Body of John
Doyle of San Ber
nardino.
SAN BERNARDINO, March 4. â
The result of the autopsry on the re
mains of John Doyle was reported
to the District Attorney by physicians
to-day. It removes all doubt that
Doyle was murdered. Numerous shot
were found in the body.
Judge C. L. Thomas, whose missing
brother, Martin, Ls charged with the
murder, says his brother has been
killed and that his body will be found
burled near Doyle's cabin. He alao
says there is a conspiracy to make
Martin the scapegoat by men who long
ago laid plans to secure Doyle's estate.
A London mother offered to sell her
baby for a quart of beer. This fact
came out at a subsequent Inquest into
the child's death.

CIRCUS DRAWS
IMMENSE CROWD
Thousands Throng Mechan
ics' Pavilion to See the Nor
ris & Rowe Performance
NUMEKOUS CLEYEK ACTS
Programme Includes Eiding,
Acrobatic Feats, Juggling
and Other Daring Stunts
The big three-ring Norris & Rowe
circus gave Its first performance in
Mechanics' Pavilion yesterday after
noon and long before the show began
the house was entirely sold out. The
same conditions prevailed In the even
ing, the huge pavilion being packed to
the doors when the grand march be
gan.
The circus proved to be one of the
beat the San Francisoo public has wit
nessed in years. It has a spick and
â pan look, everything being new and
up to data. More than 850 performers
are engaged in amusing the spectators
and they all made good last night,
setting every one to cheering.
It Is an unusually long show, last
ing for two hours aiid forty minutes.
Among the stars of the performance,
are the six Belfords, acrobats, saen
here for the first time last night, and
their act proved a wonder. They did
all kinds of daring tricks with the
utmost ease and mads a great hit
with the crowd.
Melnotte, LaNolle and Melnotte, the
high wire performers, ar-* a good trio
and their act last night was a decided
novelty. The McDonald trio of
bicycle riders have a clever act. The
clowns perform all kln-lB of stunts
from singing to footracing.
The array of animals is unusually
fine and the beasts do some remark
ably good acts. A couple of massive
elephants do a dance and three legged
"walk that is especially good. The col
lection of Shetland poniee was much
admired by the crowd, -while the bare
back riders, both men and women,
made oorae whirlwind rushes around
the rings.
Hadji Lessek, the Arab gun spinner,
proved a headliner in his difficult feat.
The dogs, camels, dromedaries and
other beasts, both wild and tame, were
all lined up last night in their various
acts. The show will continue nine
days. ,
election of officers and adoption of by
laws, will take place. The association
has already been admitted to member
ship in the American Trotting Associa
tion, under whose jurisdiction the
events at Coronado will be held.
A number of good horses are already
at the track, including L. E. Dadmun's
well known horse Red Freckles. It
is likely that the first big meet will be
held at the Coronado track on Decora
tion day and the programme will be
one of the best ever given in this part
of the country. It will include trotting
and pacing as well as racing and a
number of handsome purses will be
hung up for competition.
Holding Cotton.
Dispatches from various points
throughout the South tell of numerous
meetings of the cotton growers at
which organizations are formed and
arrangements made for holding the cot
ton crop until buyers will pay ten cents
a pound for it. The planters seem de
termined to hold their cotton until a
fair price can be obtained, and in doing
this they are receiving support from
many banks which are making cash
advances on cotton held in Btorage. â

WHAT SULPHITE DOES
For the Human Body In Health and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall
to many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us
our dally dose of sulphur and mo-
lasses every spring: and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,
and mind you, this old fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable and a
large quantity had to be taken to gret
any effect.
Nowadays we gret all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a sincle grain
is far more effective than a table-
spoonful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years research and ex-
periment have proven that the best
sulphur for medicinal use is that ob-
tained from Calcium (Calcium Sul-
phide) and solrl in druer stores under
the name of Stuart's Calcium Wafers.
They are small chocolate coated pel-
lets and contain the active medicinal
principle of sulphur in a highly con-
centrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value
of this form of sulphur in restoring
and maintaining bodily vigor and
health; sulphur acts directly on the
liver and excretory organs and puri-
fies and enriches the blood by the
prompt elimination of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo-
lasses every sprint: and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary
flowers of sulphur were often wor3e
than the disease and cannot compare
with the modern concentrated prep-
arations of sulphur, of which Stuart's
Calcium Wafers is undoubtedly the
best and most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure
constipation and purify the blood in
a way that often surprises patient and
physician alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilkins, while experi-
menting with sulphur remedies soon
found that the sulphur from Calcium
was superior to any other form. He
says: "For liver, kidney and blood trou-
bles, especially when resulting from
constipation or malaria, I have been
surprised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have
repeatedly seen them dry up and dis-
appear in four or five days, leaving
the skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie-
etary article and sold by druggists and
for that reason tabooed by many phy-
sicians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forms of skin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers," will find In Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more palat-
able and effective preparation.

WARRAXT FOR KELIiT.
Political Boss to Bo Arrested on Per-
jury Charge.
PACRAMENTO, March 4.â Martin
Kelly now* faces the penitentiary* along
with Boodlers Emmons, French, Bunk
ers and TV right. Senator C. M. Bel
shaw of Antioch swore out a warrant
late this afternoon for the arrest of
the ex-boss on a charge of perjury. It
will be served in San Francisco, it is
believed, to-morrow. After the war
rant waa sworn' out by Belshaw it was
placed in the hands of two Deputy
Sheriffs and they went on a still hunt
for the accused. They soon ascertained
that he is In San Francisco.
In the complaint sworn out by Bel
phaw upon which the warrant for Kel
ly's arre6t was issued, the fact of Kel
ly's connection with the boodlers is
set forth at length. The history of the
boodlere' scandal is first set forth and
then the allegations regarding the per
jury of Kelly are recited.
It is alleged by Belshaw that Kelly
committed perjury on February 17,
Â« hen he appeared before the Senate in
vestigating committee that had before
it the charges against Emmons,
Wright, Bunkers and French. It is al
leged that Keily committed perjury in
testifying: before the committee on the
date named that he did not. on Feb
ruary 13 in room 62 of the Capitol Ho
tel, tell Senator Belshaw that French
had handed him a $50 bill received as
part of the boodle money, French at
that time saying: "I hear. Kelly, they
are going to get out a search warrant,
and they may find this tSO bill on me.
Take it and get lt out of the city."
It is further set forth In the com
plaint agrair.st Kelly that there Is evi
dence corroborating the allegation that
hft committed perjury.
BelÃhaw is angry dear througn at
the stand Kelly took after telling him
that he had one of the much-wanted
$50 bills, and Bays that if be can have
his way in the matter Kelly will be
punished tor his crime.
DODGE IS VIGILA>T.
Assessor Causes Withdrawal of Bill
Hurting This City.
6ACRAMENTO. March 4.â Senator
Ward has withdrawn his bill designed
to insure the equitable assessment of
the franchises of national banks. The
withdrawal of the bill was the result
of a protest by Assessor Dodge of San
Francisco to Senator Ward pointing
out that lf the bill was passed $20,
000,000 of the stock of "quasi" public
corporations of Ban Francisco would
escape taxation.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1905
The decision to withdraw the bill was
reached at a meeting held this morn
ing by the Joint Committee on Rev
enue and Taxation, at which members
of the State Board of Equalization,
representatives of the banking inter
ests and the Assessor's office at San
Francisco were present.
A peculiar anomaly was presented at
this meeting. While the bill was drawn
to reach the national banks and in
crease the revenue of the State, the
barking interests favored the measure
and W. A. Kline, the Assessor's repre
sentative, opposed lt.
The committed voted unanimously to
instruct Chairman Ward to withdraw
the bill and leave the matter of taxing
national banks to the holdover com
mittee to be appointed to revise the
revenue laws of the State and report
to the next Legislature.
CROWD SEES CEREMONY.
Accords Splendid Reception to the
Cliief Executive.
WASHINGTON. March 4.âPresi
dent Roosevelt took the oath of offlc*
before a vast gathering of the people
he had been elected to serve. The at
tendant scenes were not unusual In
augurations from the time the east
front of the Capitol first became the
setting for the ceremony have been
much the same. Many of the central
figures have officiated in like capacity
oii other occasions when Presidents
have acceded to the highest office in
the gift of the American people. Chief
Justice Fuller in administering the
oath repeated a solemn function he
has performed four times â to-day his
last. Yet, with all this repetition,
nothing was jaded and everything ap
peared new.
The great crowd assembled for the
crowning event of a day full of fea
tures cannot be estimated even by
comparison. It extended far beyond
the reach of the voice and was so
denÂ»elj' packed as to carry the stage
out of the sight of many. The Capitol
plaza, resourceful in accommodating
the thousands eager to view the cere
mony, was completely filled. People
came by its numerous streets and ave
nues, which, like so many yawning,
ravenous maws, greedily swallowed the
throng until every coign of vantage
was occupied. The trees, barren of
foliage, carried their humajn burdens
ou limbs capable of bearing the weight
of man or boy, and as far away
as the terraces and marble steps of
the Library of Congress thousands
stood.
MOVEMENTS OF TROOPS.
During the hours intervening be
tween the gathering of the crowd and
the ceremony there was no letting
down of the tension of Interest. The
passing of a uniformed horseman was
sufficient to call forth cheers, al
though in some sections the multitude
showed signs of restlessness. This
was true particularly on the outskirts
of the throng, where, pressed by con
stantly arriving recruits, many strug
gled to get nearer to the point of ln
| terest. The effect upon the densely
packed multitude was a continuous
surging backward and forward â a
turbulent sea of humanity. ,
The gathering of the troops, com
mittees and civic societies entertained
the crowd throughout the long wait
incident to the ceremony.
As rapidly as the troops arrived
they took the positions assigned them.
The military escort stretched far to
the left and consisted of all branches
of the service^ â horse, foot and artil-
Rry.
The movements of the gathering
trcops and organizations were not all
the crowd had for its entertainment.
Directly in its front preparations were
in progress for the inauguration itself.
A monster stand in the form of an
open amphitheater had been erected
on a line with the rotunda of the
Capitol and there decorators were en

gaged In arranging for the ceremony
and ushers busied themselves learn
ing the sections to be assigned to the
various officials and distinguished
guests.
Some time before the beginning of
the inaugural ceremony several thou
sand persons holding tickets entitling
them to seats on the stand began to
take their places. By 12 o'clock the
human garden, which had flourished
in the Senate and House galleries, was
transplanted to the open-air amphi
theater. The brilliant costumes of the
women gave to the scene the finishing
touch of color. Added to the acre of
people seated, who looked down upon
ten acres standing, were hundreds
banked upon every projecting ledge of
the Capitol and filling the windows.
President Roosevelt came forth fro-n
between the massive pillars quietly and
composedly. He was escorted by Chief
Justice Fuller. With measured tread,
in harmony with the dignified step of
the Chief Justice, the President ad
vanced in state down the long aisle
of distinguished guests. By this time
all were standing and nothing could
be heard above the roar of thunderous
"welcome. Immediately following came,
arm in arm, the mombers of the com
mittee on arrangements.
TAKES OATH OF OFFICE.
As the President passed down the aisle
he bared his head and with character
istic sweep of his hat bowed in ac
knowledgment of the salutation from
the stand and the ovation from the
people.
At a sign from Chief Justice Fuller
the clerk of the Supreme Court step
ped forward, holding a Bible. A hush
fell over the crowd. The President
raised his right hand and the oath to
support the laws and constitution of
the United States was reverently taken
amid deep silence. When this hod been
concluded there was practically no
demonstration, and the President be
gan his inaugural address. As soon as
he finished speaking he re-entered tha
Capitol, and as he disappeared within
the building a signal was flashed to th-a
navy yard and the roar of twenty-one
guns- was begun as an official salute to
the President.

Misunderstanding About the
Tse of $30,000 Guaranteed
by the Ladies' Auxiliary
Oakland Office San Francisco Call*
1016 Broadway, March 4.
The Young Men's Christian Associa
tion of Oakland to-day issued an offi
cial statement in explanation of the
delay in the erection of the new Y. M.
C. A. building, for which an active
campaign has been in progress for
thre* years. The statement is signed
by all of the trustees ar.d directors
of the association, and explains that
owing to a misunderstanding among
members of the Ladies' Auxiliary,
which pledged Itself to raise $30,000, the
necessary funds are lacking.
The amount which has already been
guaranteed for the new building: is
slightly in excess of $15,000. but includ
ed in this Is the amount puaranteM by
the auxiliary. The ladies understood
that the amount to be raised !Â»â¢ them
was t" be expended in furnishing the
building and could not therefore be
dered as a part of the construc
tion fund. Owing to a discrepancy be
tween the wording of the pledge card
actually used and the representation
made to the ladies when they assumed
this amount, the boards were led to be
lieve that thi? subscription could prop
erly be counted.
li has bren evident that it would be
absolutely necessary to get large sub
scriptions in order to make good the
teacy caused by the withdrawal of
ih<? $30,000 from the construction fund
and to provide for the $50,000 yet called
: the plans and by the conditions

faction in Wall Street
NEW YORK, March 4.â Not much
Importance was attached to to-day's
market. Dealings were not large and
the tone was hesitating until the re
sisting power of the market was dem
onstrated. In the final dealings the
demand took on some animation and
New York Central and Union Pacific
rose strongly. The evidence of tho cul
mination of reaction in these important
stocks had a cheering effect on the
whole market and the closing was firm
and quite active.
Thp announcement that a settlement
had been effected of the export grain
rate war was received with great sat
isfaction, as the length to which this
controversy was being drawn out
threatened bad effects on railroad
earnings.
There has been a great deal of unset
tlement In the stock market this week,
owing to the heavy profit taking sales.
The rerent speculative favorites have
undergone wide reactions and this in
fluence has been sufficient at times to
overcome that of the strong new fea
tures which have developed in the mar
ket. The result has been a very active
and highly Irregular market, the vol
ume of business having risen to the
largest since the present active specu
lation was Instituted.
BIGGEST LINER
EVER LAUNCHED
Mammoth Proportions of
the Cunarder Canonia.
Now Due at New York
Special Dispatch to *n>Â» Call.
NEW YORK. March 4.â Some time
to-morrow or early on Monday there
should reach this port the biggest
steamship the Cunard Company has
ever sent afloatâ the Canonia, the new
twl nscrew giantess which is now on
her maiden trip from Liverpool to New
York.
Unlike her swift predecessors, the
Lucania and the Campania, which not
only won, but kept speed records until
displaced by the newer racers of the
German lines, the Canonia has no pre
tensions to high speed, a sober gait of
eighteen knots or co being all that the
company expects of her; but it ex
pects and confidently predicts that,
because of her great size and superb
lines, she will be able to maintain that
speed no matter if the weather be fa
vorable or not.
This addition to the Cunard line is
not only a vessel of enormous propor
tions, but her builders have managed
to install in her more novelties than
have ever before been brought to
gether in one hull. They had plenty
of space for new appointments, her
30,000 tons of displacement giving am
ple room.
Measuring 675 in one direction, the
Canonia measures 72^ feet ii\ the other.
Some idea of these proportions may be
had from the statement *lhat if the
steamship were set down beside the
Capitol at Washington it would hide
it from view. Not even the roof line,
except the rsof dome, would be above
her upper decks.
The two smoker-tacks of the giant
liner reach to a height of 150 feet above
her keel â a height equal to that of a
twplve-story building. If one of these
were laid fiat on" the ground there
would be sufficient room within the
massive elipse for two locomotives to
pas? through on parallel tracks.
On board are accommodations for
3100 passengers and for a crew of 400
men.

Dr. Nifong and Mrs. Belden first met
laet summer in the Gardens of the

Mrs. Belden returned to her home In

Racecourse for Benefit
DENOUNCED BY PULPIT
Organizations Agree to At
tend Called Meeting and
Declare Their Sentiments
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 4,
The various charitable and religious
organizations o f this city gave expres
sion at a meeting this morning against
holding the proposed charity Mayday
fete at the Emeryville race track. There
were represented at the meeting, which
was held at St. Paul's Church, the West
Oakland Home, Ladies' Corps, King's
Daughters, East Oakland Settlement,
Fabiola Hospital, Oakland Club, Pa
cific Club, "West Oakland Kindergar
ten, New Century Club, Women's Ex
change, Oakland Social Settlement and
the Associated Charities.
The Rev. Charles R. Brown expressed
himself as follows:
"I hope the Board of Trade and the
charities of this city will not approve
of holdinsr the fete at the track, be
cause racing does more harm than any
other Institution in Oakland, and I do
not except saloons, although I am a
total abstainer and am against saloons.
This track is no better than a poker
game or any other form of gambling."
By a unanimous vote of the repre
sentatives, with the exception of those
from Fabiola Hospital, these remarks
were indorsed. At a meeting to be
held at Ebell Hafl on Tuesday night
there will be present those who will use
all their influence to have the fete held
anywhere than at the track.

UKIAH, March 4.â Arendt Neilson,
an employe of the Northwestern Rail

pany's mill at Willits to-day. Neilson
was working on an edge.-. In stepping
backward he was caught in the main

Pawlicki's Misfit.
r'hief Surgeon Stephen of the Emer
gency Hospital service recently issued
an order for the arraying in military
uniforms of the surgeons and stewards
under him. A tunic such as is worn
by first lieutenants in the army was
one article of apparel called for. Dr.
Pawlicki, eager to please, purchased
and donrted a tunic, on the shoulders
of which were the straps that mark a
major. PaAvlicki is inclined to stout
ness. The tunic was not built that
way, and refused to meet in front by
a margin of nearly a foot.
"I got It just as soon as the order
came out," said Dr. Pawlicki, "two
weeks before the limit set by the chief.
I got it at a bargain from Dr. Herzog's
uncle. It doesn't fit, but the order says
nothing about fit."
Dr. Stephen heard of the Pawlicki
tunic, and on Friday visited Pawlicki
at the Harbor Hospital. The tunic
was donned for the chief's inspection
and promptly condemned as a sartorial
outrage. Stephen, It is said, thought
Pawlicki's action an attempt to bur
lesque the new order. Pawlicki pro
tested, but unless his next tunic cov
ers more of Pawlicki Pawlicki will hear
more of the chief.

a mining engineer in South Africa and
the southwestern part of this coun
try.
Though Mr. Spinks graduated from
the university with the class not later
than in 1903, he is superintendent and
consulting engineer of the American
Megnesite Company, a corporation
with large interests in this State, and
he has to his credit, despite his youth,
a series of achievements as mining en
gineer on the Witwatersrand in South
Africa, and on the "Sunken Reef" in
Arizona that might be envied by men
many years older.
His bride is a senior at the univer
sity, the daughter of Louis L. Nelson,
at whose home, 242 D Bancroft way, the
vedding ceremony was performed to
day. The bride's family has been
prominent socially for many years in

Former President of Chris

gins a Sensational Suit
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 4.
Walter M. Bird, former president of.
the Alameda County Christian En
deavor Union, to-day began suit for
divorce against his wife, Maud S. Bird,
whom he charges with Infidelity. In a
sensational complaint filed this mom
ing Bird names Dr. H. W. McDaniel
and R. M. Clemens as co-respondents
and alleges that Mrs. Bird has eloped
with Clemens, and that they are now
living at Fieldbrook, Humboldt Coun
ty. Bird lives at 516 Telegraph avenue,
and he asks the custody of five minor
children.
A. W. Johnson, 630 East Twelfth
street, reported to the police to-day
that his wife, Jeanet Serena Johnson,
has disappeared, leaving home on Mon
day morning, February 27. He has since
been unable to find any trace of her.
Johnson says that on November 30,
1904, he began divorce proceedings
against his wife, but that the action
was dismissed. Recently Mrs. Johnson

GRADUATE OF TH3 UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA AND GIRL
WHO BECAME HIS BRIDE.
ENGAGEMENT
OF PROMINENT
OAKLANDERS
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, March 4.â When Miss
Marion Smith, rose-crowned and robed
in filmy white, posed as one of the
bridesmaids in the wedding tableau
at the Fabiola benefit last night few
guessed that she would ere long be one
of the principals in a real nuptial
scene. But- even then the cards an
nouncing her engagement to Roland
Oliver were speeding on their way to
friends of the Smith and Oliver fami
lies, and to-day society is all agog with
the biggest surprise of the year. Miss
Smith Is the only daughter of F. M.
Smith, familiarly known as the "borax
king," whose vast wealth has made
him a conspicuous figure In the com
mercial world and has enabled him
and his wife to follow their generous
inclinations in a manner that entitles
them to rank with the real philanthro
pists of California. Arbor Villa, their
beautiful home in East Oakland, is the
scene of much lavish entertainment
and is also the scene of the great an
nual charity â May fete that attracts
thousands of visitors every year.
Miss Smith herself seems to be a girl
of rare sweetness of character and un
spoiled by the golden favors Dame For
tune has showered upon her. She is
accomplished, playing the piano and
organ well and being the possessor of a
very sweet, well-trained soprano voice.
The lucky man is the eldest son of
Mr. and Mrs. William Letts Oliver and
is associated in business with his
father, who is president of the Califor
nia Cap Company. The Olivers not
only rank with the wealthiest people in
Oakland, but they occupy a high social
position. No two girls in the smart set
are more sincerely admired than Caro
lyn and Anita Oliver, and their clever
elder brother shares their social popu
larity.
The wedding day has not even been
talked of yet, much less determined
upon, but owing to the prominence of
both families it will be an important
event, and in the meantime society will
have one more motive for a round of
brilliant functions.
Certainly no theater in Oakland haa
ever housed a more brilliant throng
than the fashionable audience that
greeted the participants In the Fabiola
benefit last evening. It was a good
natured crowd, too, eager to applaud at
the slightest provocation and in spite
of the fact that it was near to mid
night before the last curtain fell, the
enthusiasm, continued to the very end.
TRAINS CLOSE
BEFORE CRASH
Pennsylvania Wreck Due to
the Short Distance Be
tween the Two Sections
SEVEN ON DEATH LIST
Forty Persons Injured and
Half a Dozen of Them, It
Is Thought, Will Succumb
PITTSBURO, March 4.â Afttr thÂ«
most searching investigation it is now
practically certain that the list of dead
as a result of the collision last night
between two special trains from Cleve
land on the Pennsylvania Railroad at
Clifton station will not exceed seven.
Some of the soldiers say a number of
their comrades are still under the
wreckage, but all seem to have been
accounted for.
The following is a revised list of the
dead: Lieutenant Donaldson C. Scho
field of Company D. a Cleveland archi
tect; Captain William R. Hendrick,
battalion surgeon and k prominent
Cleveland physician; Corporal James
Kehoe, Company C, Cleveland; Private
H. R. Held, Company C; Frank Pinney,
aged 10 years, son of Lieutenant O. C.
Pinney of Company C; Dodge,
Pullman conductor, Chicago; and one
unidentified man.
The list of injured will reach forty,
six or seven of whom are likely to die.
All are being cared for at the several
hospitals. Among the more seriously
injured are: Major J. R. McQuigg,
commanding the engineers' battalion,
Cleveland; Lieutenant R. D. Smith,
Company H, Fairfleld, Ohio, cannot
live; Frank H. Johnstone, aged 2T),
Cleveland; George Riley, Cleveland,
member of Tippecanoe Club, guest of
Major McQuigg, will probably die;
Hubbard Lowe, negro cook. Cleve
land; Charles H. Sturgls, Company C,
Cleveland; James Gray, negro cook.
Battery A, Cleveland, will die; O. C.
Pinney, quartermaster, Company C,
may die; Floyd Palmer, Cleveland, op
tician.
Just, after the train had passed
through the Conway yards it had to be
stopped on account of a hot box. The
box was cooled off, but three other
stops were necessary by the time Sew
ickley had been reached.
These delays allowed the second
section to catch up and after passing
Sewickley the trains were runing but
one block apart. At Clifton the first
train was again stopped by the hot
box. The trainmen say Flagman John
Murray was sent back as an extra pre
caution to stop the train following in
case it had passed the last set of sig
nals.
Murray had hardly left the train
when the second section, running fifty
miles an hour, turned a slight bend
at this point. Engineer Nicholas
Long of the second train said the
block he passed showed green, but
when he saw Flagman Murray he ap
plied the brakes. It was too late. The
heavy train sped on over the slippery
rails and crashed fairly into the rear
coach of the first train.
The rare sight of society women posing
in the various charming tableaux was
one of the most attractive features of
the programme. The gowns In the de
but and wedding scenes were exquisite.
To my mind the last tableau was the
prettiest, when Mrs. Folger, crowned
with snowy hair and robed in a
ning violet velvet gown, posed as the
"American Woman," dreaming before
the flre of those happy incidents of her
life that had already been shown in
preceding tableaux.
The unusual spectacle of,, a woman
leader was given by Miss Winifred
June Morgan, who held the baton while
the orchestra, of which she is the di
rector and which is composed of Oak
land amateur talent, gave two very
good numbers, and also played to Inci
dental music for the tableaux.
Oik would like to dilate upon the
merits of 'The LittlÂ« Tycoon." which
rtally went very well, but space for
bids individual mention. There were
several very pretty solos and duets
that were heartily ancored. Mrs. Mc-
Murray is very, much at her ease on
the stage, and, as she has a good voice,
tco, her enacting of the old maid. Miss
Hurricane, was yery pleasing. Miss
Eiben was graceful as a fairy as Dolly
Dimple â she is a veritable little Dolly
Dimple in real life â and Mrs. Rasor.
in the leading role of Violet, quite car
ried off the honors, vocally, although
the opera was written in a key much too
low, not only for her but for the rest
of the cast. Milton Schwarti was
splendid as General Knickerbocker,
and Rufus Smith, Ernest McCandllsh
and Lowell Redfleld were also good.
Willard Barton had nothing to say,
but furnished a delightful bit of com
edy aa Lord Dolphin.
At the close of the first aot the la
dies in the cast were showered with
floral compliment* and then there wu
a call from the i udlence for Miss Cope,
who managed the affair. When she
made her appearance on the stage
there was prolonged applause, espe
cially when a great basket of pink car
nations waa passed to her over the
footlights.
The specialties by George Walker
and the singing by the De Koven Club
v.ere two of the best things on the
long; programme.

Minority Leader John S.
Williams Also Comes In
for a Token of Esteem
WASHINGTON, March 4.â The last
remaining hour of the House of Rep
resentatives of the Fifth-eighth Con
gress began at 10 o'clock this morn
ing, although it was still the legislative
day of March 2.
A prolonged discussion was precipi
tated over the conference report on a
bill prohibiting the selection of tim
ber lands in lieu of lands in forest re
serves. The report waa agreed to and
the bill was passed.
Hemenway vi Indiana, chairman of
the Committee on Appropriations, in
accordance with custom, gave a re
sume appropriations made during
the pr^ent Congress. The total per
manent and annual appropriations, he
explained, were $ii97,'>ts,lo4. while the
estimates for the next fiscal year were
J725.590.515. If there were no addi
tional expenditures there would be a
surplus at the close of the next fiscal
year of $28, 542,410.
"It now looks clear beyond question,"
he said, amid loud Republican ap
plause, "that there will be no deficit."
The usual committee of three wai
appointed to Join a similar committee
of the Senate to wait on the President
and inform him that the House had
completed its business and waa ready
to adjourn.
At 11:10 o'clock, a recess for twenty
minutes was taken. Immediately there
after Payne announced there would be
a "Joint caucus." Hepburn, mounting
the rostrum, said there were occasions
when a mild Republican like himself
could be permitted to preside over a
"Democratic caucus and when a distin
guished Democrat could preside over a
Republican caucus."
Hay of Virginia, chairman of the reg
ular Democratic caucus, then took tha
chair and in humorous vein said the
occasion was the most unique in the
political history of the country.
A pleasing Incident, said to be with
out precedent, then followed. Speaker
Cannon was presented with a hand
some loving cup, the tribute of affec
tion and esteem of the members, re
gardless of party. The presentation
speech was made by Bell of Illinois
and was punctuated throughout with
applause, the members several times
rising en masse and cheering.
Bell was followed by Williams of
Mississippi, the minority leader, who
also delivered a feeling: and appropri
ate address.
Amid deafening applause Speaker
Cannon arose to respond. He spoke as
follows :
"A gift from master to servant hum
bles the recipient. A srift from ser
vant to master embarrasses the mas
ter. A gift from equal to equal, when
prompted by confidence and esteem, is
'like unto apples of gold In pictures of
silver.' The men who compose the na
tional House of Representatives; with
their warrant of attorney from a great
people, have no superiors. They are
all equals. I am proud that I am one
of you. I am more gratified to receive
this gift than words can express. I re
ceive it as a tok-^n of your respect for
me â as one of you.
"This loving cup. notwithstanding its
magnificent proportions, is not large
enough to contain my thanks, my con
fidence in. respect for and love of you.
one and all."
When the enthusiasm had subsided
Clark of Missouri produced a second
demonstration by presenting to John
Sharp Williams of Mississippi, the
minority leader, a loving cup. the gift
of his Democratic colleagues.
When Williams arose to respond he
was accorded the same spontaneous
and general applause given to the
Speaker. He said, in part:
"I have been touched by the words
of my friend from Missouri. My col
leagues. I have felt at times the bur
den of apprehension, even approach
ing failure, in attending to the duties
which you have laid upon me. I will
therefore only say now that it affords
me, and will afford me hereafter, un
ceasing pleasure to know that you are
pleased to say that I have measurably
well succeeded. It affords me the
same degree of pleasure to know that
you are pleased to say that you are
pleased to applaud the gentleman
from Missouri when he said that, in
whatever measure I might have suc
ceeded or failed. I had tried to do my
work and had succeeded thus far, a;
any rate, in indulging in no sort of
enm'ty, no sort tfl animosity and m
sort of malice."
At ten minutes to twelve o'clock, in
response to a suggestion from WH
liams. Speaker Cannon surrendered
the gavel to James D. Richardson of
Tennessee, during the reading of the
customary resolutions of thanks to
the Speaker of the House. The res
olution was adopted with a rousing
cheer. The Speaker then resumed hia
seat and bade farewell to the mem
bers, and the House adjourned sine
die.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOALu
Few Pt*oj)!e Kmnv How Useful It Is
in Preserving Healtli and IJeauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the salost and most . efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into i
the human system for the same cleans-
Ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
j-ou take of it the better; it is not a
drug: at all, but simply absorbs the
gapes and Impurities always present in .
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after ;
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
"and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect In the stomach and bowels; It
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druEffists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lczengers, the charcoal being mixed
with honey. /;'.-'^
The daily nse of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is. that no pos-
sible harm can result from their con-
tinued use, but on the contrary, great
benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking: of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
tod bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver Is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box
at drug stores, and although in some
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in any
of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

Inadequacy of Funds for Cleaning
Sewers Results In Reduction in
Laborers' Force.
Although the Finance Committee of
the Board of Supervisors has agreed
to allow the Board of Works the sum
of $*600 monthly during the nert four
months to carry on the work of clean-
Ing and repairing eewers, Commis
sioner Maestretti yesterday figured
that the meagernesa of this amount
would necessitate the reduction of the
force of bricklayer* from five to two,
hoo-carriers from four to two, sewer
cleaners from six to four, double
teams from five to two and single
teams from five to four. One fore
man, three flushers and three hydrant
mtn will be retained.
Maestrettl aaya that the money will
be inadequate) to carry on the work.
There axe 120 barricade* around
breaks requiring immediate attention
and it will be impossible to repair
them all. He declares the Finance
Committee made no allowance for
$19,000 expended for emergency work
out of the appropriation of $85,000.
Commissioner Algeltinjrer ordered a
notice served on the California-street
Railroad Company to repair between
Its tracks on California street, between
Battery and Montgomery- Notice was
also served on Flinn ft Tracy to re
patch the pavement on Front street
and on Golden Gate avenue, which
was not properly made in some places.
Next Wednesday bids will be invited

FAILS TO GARBS OUT
THKKAT OF SUSPENSION
Mayor Schmltz Says He Will Have
Talk With Auditor Baehr Before
Taking Action.
Mayor SchmiU did not take action
yesterday on hi* threat to suspend
Auditor Baehr unless Baehr within a
week reimbursed the city for the pay
ment of audited demands for Grand
Jury expenses in excess of the budget
appropriation made for the purpose.
The week was up yesterday, but Baehr
was Ftill doing business at the old
stand. When asked if he had begun
any proeeedinjj*" In the matter the
Mayor said:
"I will do nothing in the case to
day. I propose to have a talk with
Auditor Baehr before takingr any sum
mary proceedings. I shall certainly
<-ome action, but not immediately.
I still consider that the demands for
Grand Jury expenses were paid il
legally, and the charter grants specific
powers to the Mayor of this cily in
the matter of illegal actions of any
official."
SPECIAL LEVY
TO BE REPAID
< ity Attorney Long Informs
Supervisors of Passage
of Necessary Amendment
CLAIMS 3IUST BE FILED
Taxes for Schools and Hos
pitals to Be Returned to
the Amount of $350,000
City Attorney Long yesterday noti
fied the Board of Supervisors that the
amendment recently passed by the
State Legislature extending the time
within which taxes erroneously or Il
legally collected may be refunded
trom six months to three years has
been aigned by the Governor and is
now in full force and effect. The
amendment affects the special levy
for schools and hospitals, of which
some $3 50,000 is now due the tax
's. It was prepared by City At
torney Long and his assistants. For
the information of taxpayers who will
now be enabled to collect their claims
from the city Long issues the follow
ing statement:
"That amendment was drafted and
passed for the purpose of permitting
your board to refund the taxes paid
under the assessment of 1902 for the
construction of additional school
buildings and a new county hospital,
which assessment was declared by
Judges Seawell and Sloss in the action
of Whitney vs. city and county of San
Francisco to be illegal and void. Its
effect, in a word, is to give the tax
payer opportunity to recover the
amount he erroneously paid any time
within three years from the date of
payment.
"I am informed that payment of the
tax here in question was made by
some taxpayers to the Assessor as
esity as April. 1902. In such cases
provision should be made at an early
date to refund these payments, for, to
come within the letter of the amend
ment, all claims for refunding should
be made within three years after the
date of paj-ment. In these instances
where payment was not made until
November, 1&02. there is, of course,
ample time within which to file
claims.
"An important provision of section
3604 as amended is that payment shall
be made only on the presentation of
a verified claim â that is, on a claim
that has been sworn to. The language
of the section in this regard is: 'No
order of the Board of Supervisors to
refund taxes, penalties or costs shall
be made except upon a verified claim
therefor filed within three years af
ter the making of the payment sought
to be refunded.' This provision makes
It essential, and indispensably so, that
all claims for the return of taxes be
verified and that they be filed within
the time limited in the section. Each
verified claim should b# accompanied
with the tax receipt showing the pay
ment of the money sought to be re
turned.
"I would suggest that your board
give this matter your early attention
and that you take such steps as you
deem most practicable to give effect
to the amendment, keeping in mind
the necessity for a strict compliance
with its terms. AH possible publicity
should be given to it so that those en
titled to recover their taxes should
have full notice of the method of fil
ing their claims and of the necessity
of filing them within three years after
the date they made payment to the
Assessor or the Tax Collector.
A World Traveler Says:
"Tahiti is the best of all my trips, and
I have been across the Pacific many
times; it is the poet's land, where It is
always afternoon, and my fancy ever
turns toward it with anticipation and
pleasure." A reduced rate of $125 will
be made for the voyage of March 14th.

Special Dispatch - to The Call.
DUBLIN', March A. â A scheme is
now being developed by two San Fran
cisco men for starting a woolen in
dustry in the west of Ireland. The
men in question are Robert C.
Mackeown and Alexander Henderson
and they have $50,000 with which to
carry out their project. Mackeown
and Henderson, who arrived in Ireland
about a fortnight ago, have decided to
commence operations in an obscure
little village called Leenane, in the
wilds of Connemara and beneath the
shadow of Kylemore Castle, the west
ern seat of the Duke and Duchess of
Manchester.
The selection of this site is due to
the recommendation of the Duke, who
met the promoters in New York and
dilated on the possibilities of the Irish
industrial revival, particularly In that
part of Ireland, where labor is cheap
and natural resources abundant.
A mill to be operated by water
power will be erected and Ameri
can machinery of the latest pattern
will be introduced. Large tracts of
land on the rugged mountain side will
be acquired and a hardy Scotch breed
of sheep will be reared thereon. The
wool obtained from these sheep will
pass through the various processes of
coloring, carding and cleansing at the
mill and will finally be turned into
cloth, which will be known as "Con
nemara homespun tweed."
There is at present an increasing de
mand for Irish manufactured tweed,
but the existing factories depend so
much upon obsolete processes that the
output is infinitesimal, and there does
not seem to be sufficient enterprise or
money in the country to extend it.
Mackeown and Henderson believe
that they will be able to provide em
ployment for between two and three
hundred persons, including men and
women. They believe also that there
is an extensive clientele in the United
States waiting for the Introduction of
Irish manufactured woolen goods.
Both are at present visiting the Lanca
shire centers of the cotton spinning
industry.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1905.
FOUR HUNDRED
VARIETIES GROW
Larofe Start Is Made Upon
Experiments for Benefit
of Wheat in California
The State Board of Trade, which or
iginated the movement to have experi
ments made looking to the increase in
the gluten in CaJifo: ;;ia wheat, has re
ceived Information that at two stations,
one in the Sacramento and one ln the
San Joaquln Valley, more than four
hundred varieties of grain have been
planted. The lands occupied have been
divided Into plats ranging in size from
one acre to a tenth of an acre. The
seed planted includes 360 varieties
of wheat, and also barley, oats,
rye and other grains. The seed
has been gathered from all parts
of the world where cereals are raised
extensively. Professor Shaw of the
agricultural department of the Uni
vefSity of California is at work gather
ing samples of wheat in the interior '
counties, which will be compared, later,
with samples of the grain that is grown
experimentally at the agricultural ex- j
periment stations this year.
The University of California will an- j
alyze the products of the experimental
wheat tracts this year and will also
compare it with the seed wheat import
ed for experimental use, one purpose
being to discover whether any deteri
oration has taken place during the
first season by reason of soil or climate
or both.
The importance of the pending ex- '
periments is due to the recent large
shortage in the quantity of California
wheat suitable for milling for the Ori
ental trade and some branches of do- I
mestic trade. This shortage, as lndi- 1
cated by the sums annually paid for !
imported wheat to make up the deficit, I
amounts to hundreds of thousands of j
bushels annually. The hope Is enter- I
talned that the result of the current â 
experiments may be to save these sums ;
and also to make California able to '
grow all the milling wheat that may
be needed with the growth of the flour i
trade at home and abroad.

SHOWS SCORN
FOR THE COURT
Judge Coft'ey Lectures Dis

May Send Him to Prison
EVEN CLOTHES OFFEND
Michael F. Sullivan Wears
His Sweater at Hearing
and Is Saucy to Lawyers
Michael F. Sullivan, who has suc
cessfully resisted the efforts of two at
torneys to draw information from him
regarding his profitable drayage busi
ness, must change his ways or go to
Jail. He must come into court a week
from to-morrow attired ln clothes
more befitting such a scene, leave off
his disrespectful demeanor toward
court and counsel and answer ques
tions or Judge Coffey will order his
incarceration. The Judge said that
Sullivan was guilty of contempt yes
terday, but decided to give him a week
to "think over his position and Its
perils."
When the Judge said this Sullivan
was looking the other way, but Attor
ney William Denman observed the lser
on the young man's face and called
the court's attention to It.
Said the Judge: "I am deficient
muscularly or I might box his ears. I
feel that way about such witnesses.
His whole attitude throughout this
hearing has been of contempt for
court and counsel. No one should
come into this court in the costume of
a prizefighter. lam lenient with poor
persons who come here ln the best
they can afford and I prescribe no
sumptuary rules of dress, but some re
spect Is due the Institutions of the
country In which this witness, un
fortunately, was born. Many poor
Irishmen and even Chinese show more
respect for this country the day they
land than do some of its natives."
Sullivan's case is a contempt pro
ceeding, pending since December, for
his failure to respond to an order to
show cause why he should not pay his
mother $75 a month as an allowance
out of the drayage and contracting
business of Sullivan & Sons. Jeremiah
D. Sullivan, his father, owned a half
Interest in the business and willed It
to his son at his death. Michael now
claims that h's father gave him a bill
of sale for the Interest before he died
and therefore he does not have to
account to Administrator Altken. His
reluctance to answer questions about
the receipts and expenses of the busi
ness is based upon a desire to with
hold information that might be used
ln a pending suit for an accounting.
But according to Judge Coffey he will
have to answer.

a committee representing Mission and
Market street property owners, and
the Commissioners of Publlo Works
improvements under tlje bond issue
exceeding in cost the sum of $500,000
will be begun at once. The commit
tee wag instrumental in securing pur
chasers for a large block of sewer
and street bonds on the expressed
condition that the proceeds be used to
Improve Mission, Market and Fourth
streets. The Board of Works entered
heartily Into the desires of the com
mittee and agreed to recommend
forthwith to the Board of Supervisors
that the following work be ordered:
1. Sewering of Fourth street from
Howard to Channel at an estimated
cost of 575.000.
2. Sewering of Mission street from
Second to thÂ« bay and tha sewering
of intersecting streets, $125,000.
8. Widening and repaying of Mis
sion street from the bay to Ninth

4. Widening and paving of Fourth

000.
5. Sewering Market street at its
lower end. $65,000.
6. Paving of Market street, $43,000.
7. Sewering of H street from Sev
enth to Twentieth Rvenues, $14,000.
The committee consented to the last
named amount being used for H street
at the earnest solicitation of Frank
Maestretti, president of the Board of

of $17,000 in the budget appropiation
being used In the improvement of H

The entire amdTmt available from
the bonds Is $281,200 for sewers and
$243,000 for streets. It was decided
to proceed with the improvement of

on Market street will be basalt block

rest of the street.
Other required improvements dis
cussed were that of the Great High

WHILE SHERIFF SAYS EXPERTS FOUND NO POISON
IN STOMACH REPORT OF CHEMISTS IS WITHHELD
STILL BELIEVE MRS. STANFORD WAS KILLED WITH STRYCHNINE
"HE mystery of the death of Mrs. Stanford at Honolulu took another turn last night. A cable message came from the islands with the statement of
High Sheriff Henry that the chemists could find no poison in the stomach. A special cable to The Call says traces of strychnine were found, ample
evidence to support a theory of murder. The police give credence to the latter version. It is also still the opinion of the Honolulu authorities that mur
der was committed. A peculiar and unexplained feature of the attitude of the island authorities is their action in withholding the result of the autopsy.

that it was difficult to trace it.
day before the chemists gave out
:. that there was
Stanford's stomach, and
v as communicated as positive
â C in San Francisco who have
charge of the investigations at this
end.
. It is not believed by the detectives
working on the case in this city that
the chemists have found no strych
nine, tven though no poison is detect
ed, the circumstances attending death
Justify the rigid investigation : that is
being made. The strychnine may have
been assimilated in the system, and
while it is possible that an important
piece of evidence is lost the theory of
murder Is by no means destroyed.
Mountford S. Wilson, attorney for the
Stanford estate and in charge of the
inveFtijration that is being prosecuted
v.ith fo much vigor, would express no
opinion last night. He declared him
self day before yesterday that murder
had been don*, and he could see â¢ no
reason why the investigation should
be abandoned if it proves true that no
pciscn can be discovered.
SOME ESTABLISHED FACTS.
It has been established beyond ques
tion that an attempt was made to
poison Mrs. Stanford in this city in
January. Strychnine was found in
large quantity in the bicarbonate . of
h< da from which she partook just be
fore she retired the fatal night in Hon*.
( lulu. The attending physicians pro
nounced the case one of poison to all
appearance?, and other facts still make
it certain that the good woman fell
victim to the sly hand of a murderer.
The former household employes are
still under surveillance. Ah Wing, the
suspected cook, continues to be a
prisoner at the Nob Hill mansion. The
bottle of strychnine found on Friday
in the residence is still the biggest card
the detectives have drawn. They have
not been able to connect It with any
person as yet. In the searching for the
buyer it must be taken into account
that Mrs. Stanford herself may have
purchased this strychnine, although it
is very improbable that she would keep
such a supply of the deadly drug on
hand.
The following is the Associated Press
cable that has clouded the situation
somewhat:
"HONOLULU. March 4.â High Sher

CONTENTS OF WILL
MADE KNOWN.
NIECt OF PHILANTHROPIST
GETS NOTHING FROM ESTATE
The will of Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stan
ford was filed for probate at San Jose
yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock by
Attorneys S. F. Leib and Mountford S.
Wilson.
The production of this . document
has been awaited with keen interest in
the expectation that it might throw
light on a motive for the mujflp/- of
the testatrix. Only two of ujf bene
ficiaries ", are among those who; have
THE j^f CALL
Stanford. Sheriff Henry further said
that he had questioned Drs. Shorey
and Duncan regarding the progress of
their experiments and had been in
formed by them that they had found
no traces of strychnine.
It is probable that the inquest will
be begun next Monday. Many wit
nesses have been summoned, including
a number of physicians, some of whom
have privately expressed the opinion
that poison caused the death of Mrs.
Stanford. Drs. Shorey and Duncan
have, it is said, stated that even if no
traces of strychnine are found it would
still remain possible that that drug
was the cause of death, as the amount
of strychnine which might cause death
could be so small that its discovery
would be exceedingly difficult among
a large amount of other matter, an
alyzed and determined.
DOCTORS SAY "POISON."
"From, the expressions of opinion
by some of the prospective medical
witnesses at the coming Inquest it is
indicated that they will testify that re
gardless of what the chemists report
it is their belief that strychnine
poisoning was the cause of death. The
acute indigestion theory has a num
ber of adherents, though over ten
hours passed Sefveen the time that
Mrs. Stanford participated in the pic
nic lunch and her illness. Many wit
nesses will testify concerning Mrs.
Stanford's good health and spirits all
evening before her death.
"Miss Berner and Miss Hunt still
keep to their rooms at the Moana
Hotel and decline to see callers or in
terviewers. There is considerable
speculation here as to the reason of
the coming of President David Starr
Jordan of Stanford University, who is
reported to have sailed from San
Francisco to-day."
HENRY CHANGES FRONT.
In answer to a cable of inquiry as
to the foregoing. The Call received the
following cablegram:
"HONOLULU, March 3.â Sheriff
Henry made the positive statement
â¢ight that strychnine had been
found. To-night he modifies his state
ment. It is the general opinion here
that Henry is now trying to deceive
the public at the request of the San
Francisco police and to hold back the
analysis until the arrival of the Ala
rr.tda with the detectives from that
( >ty. Forty-eight hours is regarded as
sufficient to make an analysis of the
stomach. â '
A later cable message reads:
'HONOLULU. March 3. â The chem
ists have found trace of strychnine in
the stomach, but are experiencing dif
ficulty in following them. They seem
less confident in their assertions to
night than yesterday. It is believed
that sufficient poison was found to
prove murder. Verdict at inquest may
be returned to this effect from testi
mony of attending physicians."

been prominent in the public eye since
Mrs. Stanford's death; they are:
Miss Bertha Berner, private secre
tary, $15,000.
Ah Wing, Chinese cook, $1000.
The circumstance of the filing of
the will is taken as an indication that
the detectives have their case in good
shape as to the identity of the poison
er or poisoners. At the time of giving
out copies of the testament to the
press Attorney Wilson said that he
might be in a position, as soon as the

official report of the analysis at Hon
olulu was received, to give out infor
mation the detectives have gathered.
It was to be inferred from this that
the lawyer did not regard the time far
distant when arrests would be made.
One surprising feature of the will is
that there is no bequest for Miss Jen
nie Lathrop. who was a favorite of
Mrs. Stanford. Her father shares very
liberally in the estate, however.
The total of specified bequests is
$3,110,000. The residue of the estate
is left to the university, but the
amount is not large. The following is
a copy of the will:
In the name of God, amen: I, Jane
Lathrop Stanford, of the County of
Santa Clara, State of California, wid
ow of Leland Stanford, deceased, be
ing of sound and disposing mind and
memory and mindful of the uncer

Sleuths Having Medicines in Mrs.

An investigation of the Stanford

by Captain Burnett and Captain Cal

Stanford's medicine closet contained
many bottles and boxes of liquids and
powders that had been purchased in
various parts of the world during her
travels abroad. Many of the prescrip
tions were purchased in this city and
bear upon their labels the names of
the apothecaries and the names of the
prescriptions. Whenever the police
found a prescription whose contents
they did not thoroughly understand
they carefully laid it aside and have
since caused it to be analyzed. In a
number of cases they have sent police
men in civilian clothes to drugstores
with the numbers of the prescriptions
and had them refilled, after which the
purchase has been submitted to chem
ists for analysis for the purpose of de
termining whether or not the medi
cines contained strychnine properly
prescribed or in quantities that would
suggest that it had been adminis
tered with criminal intent.
While this work is in progress the
detective, office is engaged in looking
up the careers of the various members
of the Stanford household against
whom any suspicion has been directed.
Particularly careful will this work be
in the cases of Miss Richmond, maid
tc the late Mrs. Stanford, and former
Butler Beverly. Prior to coming to this
country they were in service in Eng
land, Beverly having been a butler in
the employ of Lily Langtry and Miss
Richmond a maid in the households of
prominent British families. The main
purpose of the investigation is to learn
if Beverly and Miss Richmond enjoyed
unblemished reputations on the other
side of the Atlantic, and further if
they were- there acquainted or came to
this country together. To those who
have been watching the detectives in
their hunt for information concerning
the former maid and butler of Mrs.
Stanford it would seem that the au
thorities are deeply concerned in those
tw-o individuals and propose to over
look nothing in their careers.
The police have started out again
with renewed vigor in search of a clew
as to who may have purchased the
strychnine said to have been used to
poison Mrs. Stanford. Twice have the
apothecary establishments of this city
and Palo Alto been appealed to to fur
nish any information they may have re
garding sales of the deadly drug, but
the results have been anything but
satisfactory. First, Captain Harry
Morse, acting for Attorney Mountford
Wilson, addressed a circular to all the
local druggists asking them for the
much desired information. He received
many replies giving the names of pur
chasers of strychnine during the last
two months, as recorded on the books
of the drug stores, and representatives
of the Morse agency were sent out to
investigate each case, but nothing was
accomplished. Detectives were also sent
to Palo Alto and San Mateo on a simi
lar mission, but they returned with
out any clew. A few days ago the
regular police made general inquiry
throughout this city and adjacent
towns with the same poor result.
Yesterday it was resolved by Act
ing Chief of Police Splllane and Cap
tain of Detecttves Burnett to institute
a more thorough search and to extend
the date of possible purchase back sev
eral months, on the theory that the plot
to kill Mrs. Stanford may have orig
inated long before the strychnine is al
leged to have first been administered
to her in this city. Acting on this
supposition the patrolmen on every
beat have been instructed to make in
quiries at each drug store within their
jurisdiction.
It is admitted by the heads of the
Police Department that their hopes of
tracing the purchaser of the strychnine
are not very good. They think it pos
sible that the culprit, if an employe of
Mrs. Stanford, may have obtained the
drug from a quantity that may have
been in the Palo Alto home or the
house in this city. It is not unfrequent
ly the case that strychnine is used
about houses to destroy rats and this
may have been the case at Palo Alto.
Consequently the detectives are making
a careful search of the Stanford prem
ises with the Idea of confirming this
theory.

FINDING OF STRYCHNINE BOTTLE AT THE STANFORD
MANSION GIVES POLICE STRONG LEAD.
The discovery of a bottle of strych
nine in the Stanford mansion on Fri
day has roused the local police to ac
tivity. The find makes certain that
the person who attempted Mrs. Stan
ford's life on January 14 and who
eventually murdered her was an in
mate of the mansion on Nob Hill.
The heads of the Police Depart
ment, of course, strenuously deny the
statement that a bottle of the poison
was found. "We have no bottle of
poison in our possession," Acting
Chief Spillane maintains. But it is
known that it is in the possession of
Captain Callundan of Morse's agency.
The clew is a valuable one and the
police think it is necessary to keep it
quiet. It concentrates the number of
suspects to those who were in or
about the mansion at the time that
Mrs. Stanford drank the poisoned Po
land water. It substantiates the the
ory that the murderer at the same
time scattered the drug into other in
gredients that were in the Stanford
medicine chest.
Without this evidence the detectives
would be working in the dark. The
bottle of strychnine establishes the
facts that:
First, the poison was purchased in
or near San Francisco.
Second, it was purchased by some
one who was very close to Mrs. Stan
ford.
Third, poison from this bottle was
placed in the Poland water and in the
bicarbonate of soda.
Fourth, the grains of poison were
placed in both by the same person and
at the same time.
Fifth, the person who handled the
poison is probably some one who la
or has been in Mrs. Stanford's em-
m
The important ; evidence ; in j the case
rests with Captain Callundan' and De
tective Reynolds, who are . now on the
way to Honolulu to question Miss Ber
tha Berner. ' Meanwhile Ah Wing is

sion. â¢
Chief of Detectives Burnett yester
day said: "We are ready to make ar
rests when the time comes. Every
suspect Is within reach and we can
place our hands on the person that
may be wanted at any moment."
The heads of the Police Department
denied yesterday that they were tak
ing any active interest in the poisou
ing. "We are waiting for a cable
from Honolulu," said Acting Chief
Spillane. "There is nothing new in
the case to-day. Detective Reynolds
is the only detective from this office
who is on the case."
QUESTION MISS RICHMOND.
Maid Is Cross-Examined by Four De
tectives at Burlingrame.
Miss Elisabeth Richmond, who was
with Mrs. Stanford when the attempt
was made to poison her on January 14.
gave a detailed account yesterday of
what she knew of the affair to Chief of
Detectives Burnett, Detective Ed Gib
son and two representatives of the
Morse Detective Agency. She was
closeted with the four cross-examiners
for four hours in the home of Arthur
Beverley. near Burlingame.
Miss Richmond's description of the
scene that occurred when Mrs. Stan
ford learned that an attempt was made
on her life is particularly vivid.
She says: "The first question asked
by Mrs. Stanford on the Monday after
the attempt was made on her life was,
'Did you get It?'
" 'Get what?' I aaked.
"She replied, 'The analysis of the Po
land water.'
"I said, 'No. It has not come yet, but
i will telephone to Wakelee's and have
them hurry it up.'
"Miss Berner in a few minutes camÂ©
in and repeated, 'Did you get it?'
' "I again asked what she wanted and
she said 'I want to see the analysis of
that Poland water,' and then added
that her mother was very anxious >o
know what the analysis was, and 1 told
her I did not understand why iier
mother should be so particular about
the affair, as it meant a great deal
more to us than any one else.
"I telephoned every day to Wake'ec'g,
and on Friday the analysis waa re
ceived through the mall.
"i handed the mail to Miss Berner.
Mrs. Stanford was in bed suffering:
from a severe cold and Mrs. Charles
Lathrop was sitting on the foot of th 2
bed at the time. Miss Berner said, 'Oh,
here is a note from Wakelee's. I yuess
it must be the analysis of the Pcland
water.'
"Mrs. Stanford said, 'Read it, Ber
tha.' Miss Berner then read the whole
analysis and when she came to that
part stating there was strychnine in it
a great look of surprise came over th*
face of everybody present and Mrs.
Stanford fell back on the pillows and
said, 'Good God, why should any one
harm me?'
"There was quite a sensation far a
few minutes in the room, but Mrs.
Stanford quieted herself and soon after
I left the apartment."
Here in full is Miss Richmond's ac
count of the poisoning:
"I entered the chamber of Mrs. Stan
ford on the night of January 14. Mrs.
Stanford had just thrown off every
thing from her stomach, and I went
over to where she was and took up the
glass of Poland water by her bedside
and tasted it and it was very bitter.
Miss Berner came into the room and
put her finger into the water and then
to her lips. She at on.cc detected the
bitterness, and Mrs. Stanford said she
had swallowed nearly a whole glass
ful, and it burnt her stomach so
she put her finger down her throat and
was relieved.
"I then took the bottle and what was
left of the contents and started with
it down to Wakelee's drug store. I was
so afraid that I might drop the bottle
getting on or off a streetcar that I
walked all the way down town. I left
the bottle with the clerk at Wakelee's
and asked him to have an analysis
made and send the analysis and the
bill for the same to Mrs. Stanford when
the work was,' completed.
"I told the clerk what had happened
to Mrs. Stanford, and he said the
symptoms were like those of poisoning,
and he told me unless she was better
when I got home to telephone for a
doctor at once.
"I rushod home, and found Mrs. Stan
ford fueling quite herself again, but
hungry. At her request I heated some
milk, which she drank with relish.
The next clay was Sunday and she was
feeling well, and, with Miss Berner,
went to Palo Alto for the day and re
turned Monday morning.
"I left the employ of Mrs. Stanford
on January 27. I had said some eight
months before that I was very tired,
and I wanted to rest; but she begged
me to stay, raised my wages $5 a
month and gave me a larger room in
the California- street home. Before
Christmas, however, I again told her
I needed a rest, and she said: 'Very
well. Will you wait until the end of
January?' I assented and remained
until January 27, and at that time Mrs.
Stanford was in San Jose. Mr. Lathrop
paid me off on that day and I left."
ENJOYED THE VOYAGE.
Mrs. Stanford In Good Health During
Trip to Honolulu.
Walter L. Johnstone, chief clerk of
the Harriman steamship lines, passen
ger department, was a fellow passen
ger on the liner Korea with the late
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford. Johnstone was
on his honeymoon trip and he and his
wife saw a great deal of Mrs. Stan
ford during the voyage.
Nobody on the Korea, excepting, of
course, Mrs. Stanford and her attend
ants, knew anything about the sup
posed attempt at poisoning which had
furnished the motive for Mrs. Stan
ford's hurried departure from home
and the topic was not referred to by
any one.
Johnstone returned yesterday on the
liner Mongolia and was shocked to
learn that the delightful old lady,
whose cheerful conversation was one
of the bright memories of the out
ward trip, had passed away, a victim
of poison.
"Mrs. Stanford," said Johnstone yes
terday, "appeared to be in splendid
health during the voyage from first to
last, and during the five days we stay
ed at Honolulu she appeared to be en
joying life with a great deal of zest.
The day before we left my wife and I
called upon her, but she was out driv
ing.
"We saw a great deal of her during
th 3 voyage and she seemed to take as
much healthy enjoyment out of life as
any of the younger people. We went
through a very heavy storm and even
in that Mrs. Stanford found much to
delight her. She was glad she was on
a big ship and pleased to find herself
such a good sailor.
"She intended taking the Siberia from
Honolulu to Japan and she talked long
and frequently of the lovely time she
expected to have in the Orient. As the
Korea passed into Honolulu she point
ed out to us her rooms at the Moana
Hotel and told of her plans for making
the most of the time she would be in
Honolulu until the Siberia, outward
bound, would arrive to take her to Ja
pan.
"Mrs. Stanford and Miss Bernerâ
Bertha, Mrs. Stanford always called
her â appeared to be very devoted to
each other. Miss Berner never left
her employer and was constantly busy
ing herself to keep Mrs. Stanford In
terested and comfortable.
"From what I saw of Mrs. Stanford,
and I saw a good deal during that trip
on the Korea, I would say that her
health was good and her mind won
derfully clear. In discussing the ar
rangements for her transportation af
ter leaving Honolulu, she was as busi
ness-like as any man of affairs. Judg
ing from her appearance and conver
sation the last time I was with her,
she seemed vigorous and happy and I
am sure she was in no doubt that be
fore her lay a long span of life which
she would have the health and spirit
to thoroughly enjoy."
SfISS RICHMOND WORRIED.
Rigid Questioning by Detectives Wears
on Her Nerves.
PALO ALTO, Mar. 4.â Miss Elizabeth
Richmond was to-day interviewed for
several hours by a force of detectives
from San Francisco at the home of Al
bert Beverly, near Burlingame. She
gave her testimony in a straightforward
manner and talked freely of all the
events surrounding her connection with
Mrs. Stanford and the occurrences of the
night in January when Mrs Stanford
drank the bottle of Poland water. She
was plied with many questions as to
what motive or theory there could pos
sibly have been for any one attempt
ing the life of Mrs. Stanford, but she
was unable to offer the slightest sug
gestion why any one should have at
tempted the deed.
At the end of the interview she was
very much excited and her pale face
was much flushed. It had been a try
ing ordeal, telling severely on her
nerves, and she was bordering on a
state of nervous collapse when the de
tectives started back for San Francisco
after 6 o'clock to-night. She then
went out in company with Mr. Bever
ly for a short walk, to get the air and
generally collect herself. She said as
she was starting to go on the walk:
"The detectives say that I am free
now to go where I please I would like
to fade away to some distant spoC
where no one would know me, for this
burden of suspicion weighs on me.
Once there I might change my name. "
"Why don't you get married and do
it?" laughingly interrupted Mrs. Bev
erly, who was standing near.
"No, indeed." retorted Miss Rich
mond, a faint smile lighting up her
troubled features for the first time
since the detectives had arrived. She
continued: "I realize I am in for it and
I know 1 must face any possible accu
sations that may be brought against
me, but I have told the detectives all
I know of the terrible matter. I have
tried to help them sift the matter to
the bottom. The detectives tell me I
can go where I like, but if I am ar
rested I shall not fear, for I know I
am innocent and except for the nerv
ous strain of a trial I shall not be seri
ously troubled. Mr. Gibson and the
other detectives were all very gentle
manlike. They were quiet and after
allowing me to tell my story they
asked some questions, not many, how
ever, and all the questions were prac
tically 'What was my theory of. the
occasion of the poisoning?' Of course,
in the presence of four strange big de
tectives I suppose I must have been
more or less unset, but I tried to give
them every detail of the scenes on the
night of January 14."
RECALLS OLD INCIDENT.

OFFICIALS OF UNIVERSITY
AND DETECTIVES LEAVE
Alameda Sails for Honolulu With Men Who
Are to Bring Back Mrs, Stanford's
Body and Avenge Her Death.
Dr. Dbvid Starr Jordan, president of
Stanford University, and Timothy Hop
kins, one of the trustees of that insti
tution, left on the steamer Alameda
yesterday for Honolulu to bring back
the body of Mrs. Stanford. With them
went two of the brightest detectives in
the West, Captain J. J. Caltundan of
the Morse Agency and Harry C. Rey
nolds of the San Francisco Police De
partment. The mission of the presi
dent and the trustee, representing the
university faculty and board, is to per
form the formal and sad duty of es
corting the body to the place where
shall be laid to rest. The purpose of
the detectives is to gather more evi
dence toward lading bare the horrible
crime at which the world shudders.
"What a terrible ending for a life
that meant so much of good to man
kind," commented President Jordan as
he paced the wharf in a manner un
usually fretful while awaiting the sail
ing hour. 'What a horrible thought it
is that such a great good woman
should meet her death by rat poison.'
President Jordan was convinced that
murder had been committed. The pub
lication of the exclusive news in The
Call yesterday morning that the chem
ists at Honolulu had definitely reported
the presence of strychnine in Mrs.
Stanford's stomach removed all doubt
in his mind on this point. Another vital
piece of news The Call gave its readers,
that of the discovery of the bottle of
strychnine in the Nob Hill mansion,
strengthened his views very much as
to those among whom the guilty per
son or persons is or are to be found.
JORDAN IS AGITATED.
It is not often that the head of the
university gives way to agitation or is
seen with poise ruffled. But yesterday
morning his usual imperturbability was
overcome. His sentences were quick
and sharp, expostulations almost, and
the betrayal of nervousness could not
be mistaken.
Mrs. Jordan was at the dock to bid
him good-by. But it waa not a happy
leave-taking. The ocean voyage on a
great, comfortable ship was not looked
forward to with the customary antici
pations of pleasure. The president
spent most of his time in earnest con
ference with Mountford S. Wilson, at
torney for the Stanford estate, and the
plans for conducting investigations at
Honolulu were thoroughly discussed.
The detectives will work under the di
rection, to some extent, of Jordan and
Hopkins at Honolulu.
Just before embarking on the liner
the president said he wished emphati
cally to deny that Mrs. Stanford's in
terest In spiritualism was other than
purely scientific. The matter had come
up more than once during her lifetime,
said the head of the university, and
Mrs. Stanford had made herself very
clear to him regarding her views to
ward psychic phenomena of all kinds.
Both Senator and Mrs. Stanford, said
Dr. Jordan, held hopes that scientific
Investigation would show a scientific
basis for belief in a future life. Beyond
that their Interest did not extend, and
in professional mediums, who for a fee
brother, Ariel Lathrop, now living In
Albany, is a pleasing piece of news to
the latter's many friends in this city,
where he was formerly a social favor
ite. Years ago Ariel Lathrop held th*
same position practically as that now
filled by his brother, Charles G. Lath
rop, at Palo Alto, and apparently en
joyed the full confidence of Mrs. Stan
ford in all her private and business af
fairs and was also a favorite with the
late Senator Stanford. Although living
in Palo Alto he was a frequent visitor
to San Francisco, and during his stay
here he was invariably the guest of hi*
bachelor friends, whom he, in turn,
entertained at his home in the south.
One day the news suddenly spread
that Ariel Lathrop was going to leavo
Palo Alto, and the following day found
him in San Francisco. Rumors of a
breach between him and his sister
reached this city and were accepted
with considerable credence by Lath
rop's friends, who afterward claimed
that some slighting reference made by
him to the much-loved dead son of the
Stanfords had reached Senator Stan
ford's ear and that the latter had or
dered Ariel to Immediately leave the
Stanford University. How much truth
there was in this story no one seems
to have been able to learn, but at the
time It was in circulation Ariel Lath
rop left for his old family home in Al
bany, where he has since lived.
Although every one understood that
Lathrop and Senator Stanford were at
outs, when the latter died he left hi?
brother-in-law $100,000. Now his dead
sister's will adds to his fortune â the
income on $2,000,000, which is set aside
for him during his lifetime. Whether
he will return to San Francisco to at
tend the funeral of Mrs. Stanford is a
question that is causing much specula
tion among his many former friends
here.

to-day. It wag reported that he tried

Late to-night a messenger rode out

WERE NOT SPIRITUALISTS.
"During Senator Stanford's life."
said Dr. Jordan, the statement was
made mors than once that the idea of
founding t'ae university came to the
Senator as i. suggestion from the spirit
world. Noc long before his death Sena
tor Stanford discussed this matter with
me. He was afraid that the spiritual
istic fake would live after he had
passed away and feared that unscru
pulous pejple night endeavor to maka
capital out of it. To offset this and
to make his own p< n the
matter he dictated to me an emphatic
dental, which is still in my possession,
but the exact wording of which I do
not recall. In substance, however, it
amounted to this, thdt spiritualism had
had absolutely nothir.< to do with the
foundation of Stanford University.
"The Senator said that the only basis
anybody could have for starting such
a report was the fact that he and Mrs.
Stanford, in company with General and
Mrs. Grant, had attended several spir
itualistic seances, partly through inter
est in what then was a novelty. Be
yond this it had no significance. And
in the commercial spiritualism of the
professional medium neither Senator
nor Mrs. Stanford had a particle of
faith."
Timothy Hopkins arrived on the
wharf a few minutes before the gang
plank was pulled up. He was a
panied by Whitelaw Rei<l Of New York.
a fellow trustee of Stanford University
and old-time friend, likewise, of Mrs.
Stanford. Hopkins' face reflected thÂ©
seriousness of his purpose in embark
ing c-n the ocean voyage. He. too, had
been reluctant to believe that the
tragedy at Honolulu was the outcome
of foul purpose to destroy the life of
one of the world's noblest characters.
CONVINCED IT WAS MURDER.
"It is hard to bring one's self to
think that Mrs. Stanford was mur
dered, but in the light of recent de
velopments such must be the accepted
fact." was all Hopkins had time to
say as he hurried aboard whiie the
steam screeched in the whistle.
Harry N. Morse, head of the detec
tive bureau in charge of the case, was
present to. give his nnal instructions to
Captain Callundan. When the latter
arrives at his destination they will
open communication by cable and Im
portant steps are expected to follow
at once.
Detective Reynolds will represent the
Police Department of the city. It
looks as if the crime had its root in
San Francisco and if that proves true
the duty will devolve upon the depart
ment to ferret out the murderer. It
is not certain how long Callundan and
Reynolds will remain in Honolulu, for
there may be much or little work for
them to do there.
Arrangements have been made with
the steamship company to hold the
China, which is returning from the
Orient, at Honolulu until the arrival of
the Alameda, so that President Jordan
and Hopkins can turn about and start
back at once with the corpse.

was the reply.
"I know nothing about it and do
not care to talk," answered Berner,
and he withdrew his head and shut
.the window.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1905.
FIREMEN AND POLICE
PRACTICE ON THE FIELD
Rival Baseball Teams Are Preparing
for the Deciding Match of
the Series.
Recreation Park is a busy place
these dayÃ, as the police and firemen
are practicing every day for the big
baseball gamÂ© which takes place next
Sunday. These teams have played
two games, each winning one, the fire
men by the score of 4 to 3, and the
police by a 7 to 5 score. This game
will decide the series.
Tom Fitzpatrick, who goes to Fres
no to pitch for the Tigers, will come
up to officiate for the firemen through
the kindness of Manager Mike Fisher
of the Tacomas. Fltz will have the ser
vices of a good backstop In Charley
Strelb, wh<f Is on the eligible Hat of
the Fire Department
The police will pin their faith and
bet their dollars on Charley Blrdsall,
with his slow, puzzling delivery.
Backed by a good team, they feel con
fident of victory. The firemen will be
greatly strengthened by the addition
of Gallatln, Cuneo and Donnadleu.
The former two did great work In the
firemen's game at Los Angeles. Don
nadleu did some great hitting In the
game with the crack Pensacola team
at Goat Island a few weeks ago. Ten
thousand tickets have boon disposed
of for the game and the demand for
seats Is increasing daily. The police
will have several large whistles sta
tioned In their section of the grand
stand to offset the bells and gongs of
their opponents, while the firemen
will be there with their "chimes." The
proceeds of the game will go to the
Home for the Aged of the Little Sis
ters of the Poor.

MIXED DOUBLES
TENNIS PLAY
Two Teams Remain in the
Tournament on the Gold
en Gate Park Courts
COMPETITION IS KEEN
Deciding Match for the
Trophy Will Take Place
on Wednesday Afternoon
The mixed doubles tennis tournament
played on the park courts yesterday by
the young ladies of the Golden Gate
Annex and the boys of the Junior Club
proved an interesting affafr. It was
witnessed by a good-sized crowd. Play
was completed down to the finals,
which wiil b3 played next Wednesday
afternoon. The successful teams were
Miss Vera Crocker and Maurice Mc-
Loughlln and Mrs, C. Watson and R.
Strachan.
Miss Crocker and McLoughlln had a
difficult time reaching the finals. They
first met R. Van Vliet and his sister.
Miss Sarlta. The latter are children of
Major Van Vliet of the PreÃidio and
piay remarkably well for their age.
The youth, In particular, handles his
racket like a veteran. He is but little
taller than his racket and is about 8
years old. He chopped and drove balls
as hard and as accurately as an old
timer. His sister plays a steady game,
but has no back hand at all.
Miss Crocker and McLoughlin allow
ed the Van Vliets only "owe 2-6," but
they had to play their best to win. The
ecore stood 5-1 in favor of the winners
in the first set, but the Van Vliets took

Two Heavyweight Fights in Sight.
Manager Alex Greggains of the San
Francisco Athletic Club has an idea
the fight followers have been surfeited
with bouts in which lightweights,
feathers and bantams have figured as
principals. As a result he has arrived
at the conclusion that matches be
tween big fellows will fill a long felt
want in the hearts of the sports. Greg
gains has gone as far East as Chicago
to find a likely opponent for Sam Ber
ger. Bill Rickards, a 210-pounder
from the Illinois metropolis, has been
selected. He will attempt to lower
Sam's colors in the main event of the
San Francisco Club's four-round show
on the night of the 15th inst.
On the 2Sth of the month J. Arthur
Johnson and Marvin Hart will deter
mine which is the better ringster be
fore the same club.

MINOR LEAGUES
READY FOR WAR
Howard Griffiths and ""Tinp n
O'NeiU Here to Confer
With Pacific Coast Men
DEMAXI) HIGHER PRICES
If Major League Magnates
Do Not Come to Terms a
Fight May Be the Result
Unless the two major baseball
leagues of the country do not mak*
some concessions to the class A minor
leagues the latter are liable to start
an Independent association and fight
the big associations to a finish. It
was for the purpose of making pre
liminary arrangements for a demand
on the big leagues that Howard Grif
fiths, president of the Jersey City Club*
and Tip O'Xeill, head of the Western
League, arrived in this ctty yesterday.
These two leading baseball lights
came all the way to the coast to con
fer with the magnates of the Paciflo
Coast League relative to the drafting
process now in vogue. President Bert
had a long, talk with the Easterners
yesterday afternoon. Alter It was all
over the magnates decided to all a
special meeting of the league on Tues
day night, when the matter will b*
thoroughly threshed out.
It looks as though the big leagues
will simply have to come to the term 3
of the class A minors. At the present
time the major bodies can go Jn and
draft the best two men from each class
A minor league club for he sum of $750
per man. President Griffiths made a
demand for at least JIOOO at the recÂ°rt
convenion in Chicago, but the bigr
turned him down coldly.
The Pacific Coast magnates are in
favor of higher draft and theref
is certain they will listen to the argu
ment about to be presented by Grif
fiths and O'Neill and lend them every
aid in thair power to make the big
leagues come off their hifrh horse.
Griffiths and O'Neill will remain here
tor several days or till they co
an understanding with the baseball
powers of the Coast League.

Steamer Oregon Arrives.
The steamship Oregon, which took
flre at sea February 27 off Crescent
City and narowly escaped destruction
by fire, arrived yesterday from Eureka,
listed heavily to starboard and with
$50,000 worth of cargo charred by fire,
blackened by smoke or soaked into use
lessness by the water which had been
used to extinguish the flames. The
Oregon came from Eureka under her
own steam and in spite of the fact that
she was heeled over at an angle which
to a landsman looked dangerous, she
averaged about 13 knots and made the
run in 17% hours.
The Oregon docked at Harrison street
wharf without any assistance and with
little delay. Captain Warner proved
that to the sailorman who knows how
docking a steamer, even a lopsided one,
is not such a difficult operation after
all.
The origin of the flre is a mystery
which may be locked up In the tangled
mass of flame-seared merchandise
which now litters the after-hold. Cap
tain Warner and Chief Officer Bou
tiller deny that the flre was caused by
phosphorus shipped as sulphate of
lime. There were a few cans of phos
phorus on board, but not among the
cargo. The phosphorus was on deck,
they say, and could have had nothing
to do with causing the flre. Captain
Pillsbury, representative of the San
Francisco underwriters, who boarded
the Oregon at Eureka and who came
back on the steamer, also scouts the
phosphorus theory. He made as thor
ough an Investigation of the fire as
possible under the conditions and de
clares that he saw or heard of nothing
to indicate how the flre started.
Guy L. Blair, agent of the steamship
company, says there is no law against
shipping phosphorus, properly packed
and in water, with other cargo. He
has no reason to suppose, he says, that
phosphorus had anything to do with
the fire.
The Oregon's deck plates and frames
are much damaged and many of them
will have to be renewed. The damage
to the vessel is estimated at $40,000, and

To Destroy the Derelict,
The navy transport Solace wan sent
to sea yesterday from Mare Island on
a mission that will meet the approval
of the coast shipping world. She Is un
der orders to proceed to a point 600
miles north and west of here and there
find and destroy a derelict. Thfs dere
lict has been reported several times
within the last ten days or so, and
some surprise was expressed that none
of the revenue cutters lying at Sausa
lito was sent to destroy the menace to
navigation. Now that the navy has
taken up the matter, there is thought
to be a good chance of ridding the
coastwise steamer track of the floating
danger.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 5, 1905,
CITY BUYS LAND FOR
NEW SUNNYSIDE SCHOOL
Board Prepares to Restore Classes In
James Lick and NoÂ© Valley
Institutions.
The first purchase of land for the
proposed new school buildings to be
built under the bond issue was made
Friday in Judge Coffey's court by
President Roncovieri of the Board of
Education, Clerk Fay of the Board of
Supervisors and Assistant City Attor
ney Smith on behalf of the city. The
land comprised a block bounded by
Lippard, Berkshire, Fulton and
Joost avenues, belonging to the
John Pforr estate, and was bid in for
$5600. The appraisement made/by
ex-City Engineer Grunsky was $7400
for half the property. The lot will be
used as a site for the Sunnyside School
building, to cost $45,000. Judge Cof
fey has under advisement a bid of the
city for a lot in the rear of the Wash
ington Grammar School.
Through an inadvertence it was re
ported that the Board of Education
had rescinded its action In exchang
ing the primary classes of the James
Lick School and the grammar classes
of the Noe Valley School in deference
to the petition of parents of pupils af
fected. The bpard is disinclined to
adopt the recommendation of Super
intendent Langdon that the classes in
eech school be restored until it is
proven that the pupils are suf&ering a
hardship. President Roncovieri yes
terday requested a representative of
the West of Castro Club to secure a
list of the names of pupils attending
the classes that were exchanged, to
gether with the distances they have to
travel to the schools. After this has
been done the classes will be made up
of the disaffected pupils and estab
lished in the school nearest to their
hcmes. Roncovieri states that some
parents have opposed the change, al
though they have no children attend
ing either of the schools, and says that
these will not be considered in the pro
posed restoration of conditions as they
existed before the change.

MINER GOES ON WARPATH
AND WINDS UP IN JAIL
George Brown Shoots Out Lights In
Ix>dging-House and Jumps
Through a Window.
A lodging-house at 116 Grant ave
nue was the scene of a rough house
last evening, in which George Brown,
a miner; two soldiers and a sailor
played leading roles. When the mix
up was at its height Brown pulled a
revolver from his pocket and began
to shoot out the lights. He was over
powered by his companions, who
called for the colice.
When Patrolmen Brady and Fen
nell arrived Brown jumped through a
window to the second floor of the
house, a distance of fifteen feet. He
was captured and taken to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital to be treated
for numerous cuts. He later accused
the officers of stealing $400 and his
watch.' A search of the lodging-house
resulted in the finding of $230 be
longing to the miner. He was locked
up in the City Prison on a charge of
drunkenness. â ~ ~-~ >*Â«
