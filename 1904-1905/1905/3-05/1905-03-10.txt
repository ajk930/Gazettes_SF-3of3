HONOLULU, MARCH 9.â
High Sheriff Henry and his
deputy are pleased with
the verdict of the Jury in
the Stanford case. Henry
said to-night: "We have
done our duty, proving that
murder was done. It is
now up to the San Francis
co police to get the mur
derer, for nobody here com
mitted the crime."
HONOLULU, March 9.â
The Coroner's jury to-night re
turned a verdict that Mrs. Jane
L. Stanford died from poison.
The verdict says that death was
due to strychnine poisoning, the
poison having been introduced
into a bottle of bicarbonate of
soda with felonious intent by
some person or persons to the
jury unknown.
The end of the inquest with a
positive verdict of murder leaves
the Honolulu authorities as much
without a clew as when Mrs.
1
Stanford died.
High Sheriff Henry said after
the inquest that it was his opinion
that the strychnine was placed in
the soda in San Francisco by a
member of Mrs. Stanford's
household.
At the inquest Dr. Shorey tes
tified that the strychnine used,
as shown by the tests, was a
strychnine such as is not used
generally for medical purposes,
but used principally for poison
ing animals. This statement is
regarded as of possible assistance
in tracing the purchase of the
strychnine.

ing an incident of last Sunday,
when, as Miss Hunt was taking
Miss Berner' s parasol from the
Moana Hotel to the bathing pier,
Miss Berner dropped her gloves
into it. This has been referred to
as a suspicious circumstance. Both
ladies testified in a perfect

the incident, and their testimony
on this point concluded the case.
The jury returned the verdict
after about two minutes' delib

It is thought that the detect

steamship Alameda to-morrow

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
I). â Impressive services in memory of
Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford were held
in the Leland Stanford Memorial
Chapel to-day. It was the saddest
founders' day in the history of the uni
versity.
This anniversary has usually been
a day of merry-making and elaborate
ceremonies. To-day the atmosphere
about the campus was exactly oppo
site to that 01* a holiday.
In the chapel the organ pealed the
favorite airs of Mrs. Stanford. Ben
jamin C. Blodgett was the organist.
Assisting at the merning services were
Miss Pearl Cooper and Samuel Savan
nah, violinist, from San Francisco.
The entire chorus was present at the
afternoon service and Miss Cooper was
again the soloist. The sacred edifice
was filled at both services to its ut
most capacity by students and friends,
who had come to pay respect to the
departed benefactress of the great uni

Quizzed Regarding the
Poland Water,
The actions of the police appear to
show, that four of the Stanford house
hold are under suspicion. The four
who have been under the strongest flra
of investigation are Elizabeth Rich
mond. Albert Beverly, Ah Wing and
Ah .Young, his nephew. It is said that
Mrs. Stanford's relatives do not be
lieve, that Miss Berner is implicated in
the 'â¢ poisoning of her benefactor.
Whatever evidence the police now
hold ? they are guarding closely, hoping
to complete the chain. According to
Captain Burnett no " arrest will be
made until the result of the inquest on
Mrs. Stanford's death is made known.
- Every nook and corner of the Stan
ford mansion on California and Powell
streets was searched by four detec
tives. ,Ah Wing, whom Miss Berner
once declared she suspected. Ah Young,
general servant, aÂ«d Nora Hopkins,
Mrs. Stanford's maid, were rigidly
questioned. ; '
Miss ' Hopkins was summoned from
Palo Alto, where ; she has been since
Mrs. Stanford left for Honolulu. Whila
none of these are under ostensible sur
veillance not a move is made by any
one of them without the knowledge of
the police.
Attorney Mountford Wilson unlocked
doors, trunks and chests for the detec
tives and * helped to make ' the . search
a thorough one. It was found in this
investigation that any of the employe*
of Mrs. Stanford could easily have en
tered her, room at any time.
vit was learned that Ah Wtog, facto
tum of the household/frequently en

slept.- Both, he: and Ah Young were

were straightforward and direct.
The point lhai the police are work

Poland water was left in Mrs. Stan

It is not likery that Russell J. Wilson
will act as one of fhe executors of Mrs.

ahly prevent his acceptance of the ap
pointment made in the will.
Mrs. Stanford took the precaution
to name six executor? for her la?t will
and testament. They are Charles Q.
Lathrop, Tim-othy Hopkins. Joseph D.
Grant. Whitelaw Reid, T. G. Crothers
and Russell J. Wilson. The last named
is a brother of Mountford Wilson and
hifc law partner.
But it is understood that Russell J.
Wilson has indicated his purpose as
not desiring to take part in the admin
istration of the big estate, ill-health
not permiting him to engage actively
in business. The duties will therefore
devolve on the other appointees. There
could be no new appointment of an
executor by the courts, unless all those
nominated in the will were incapaci
tated or dead.

LOS ANGELES, March 9. â Know
ing that he Is dying and that no hu
man agency can save his Hie, Charles
E. Dowries, whose home Is near Ukiah,
gave to -the authorities to-day an ante
mcrtem statement which they know
to be false. Even when Downes was
told that It was known he was lying
he refused to correct his statement,
saying that he hoped his slayer would
never be captured.
Downes was found Monday night
dying on the sidewalk by members of
a hose company returning from a fire.
He had been shot in the back. He
was placed on the hose wagon and
tt-ken to a hospital. He stated that
he- did not know who had shot him.
It developed that his wound was very
serious and to-day an opei-ation was
performed and thirty inches of his in
tvstines removed. When he recovered
partially from the anesthetic he de
clined to say who had shot him. His
statement was that he had met four
men on the street and one of them
fined at him. but more than that he
would not tell.
The detectives have found persons
who saw Downes accost a woman on
the street and heard her scream. A
man approached and called Downes
by name and then shot him. The man
and woman then disappeared.
When found Downes admitted that
he knew who fired the shot, but he soon
changed his slory and professed ignor
ance of the man's identity. He will go
to his grave with the secret untold be
cause he will die before morning. It
is believed he is trying to shield the
woman.

'An army of 3000 peasants from the

PASSING OF THE CHINESE
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
How Nature Is Solving for Herself
the Question of the "Yellow
Peril."
In fifty yearsâ perhaps less than fifty
if the present laws remain in effect and
are rigidly executedâ the Chinese popu
lation of the United States will become
practically extinct. From 1890 to 1900
they fell away from 128,778 to 119.050. a
decrease of nearly 8000. or more than 6
per cent. In the fiscal year ending June
30, 1903, more than 4000 voluntarily left
the port cf San Francisco for the land
of their birth, the total deported and
returning voluntarily being 5020. A
very large majority of these Chinamen
were advanced in years and went home
to die.
A generation ago there were in San
Francisco from 30,000 to 40.000 China
men. The Chinese Consul General there
told me that, counting men, women
and children, there are now not 10.000.
The same proportionate decrease Is
seen In other places. It should be borne
in mind that the total number of Chi
nese now in the United States includes
26,767 In Hawaii and 3116 in Alaska, so
that at the beginning of this decennial
period there were living in the United
States proper only 89,000. A generation
ago there were at least 150,000.
According to the most liberal esti
mate there are not more than 150 legal
Chinese wives In San Francisco. But
the nCrnber of Chinese women is esti
mated at between 1000 and 1200. Of
such frtnale children as are born to the
lowest class a large proportion are sold
for immoral purposes by their parents,
tliUB still further reducing the possibili
ties of an increased population.
The main adult population is male, is
unmarried, or at least wifeless in Amer
ica, and is rapidly approaching old
age. Thus by 1930 or 1940 the main
Chinese life in America will have be
come extinct.â World's Work.

KIRKMAN GIVES
HIS VERSION
Army Captain Tells of *His
Connection With Suicide
of Mrs. Bessie Chandler
HOPED TO MARRY HER
Also States' That It Was His
Intention to Take His Life
When She Killed Herself
Special Dispatch to' The Call.
VALENTINE, Neb., March 9.â The
alleged causes of Mrs. Bessie Chan
dler's suicide were explained to-day in
a statement by Captain George F.
Kirkman of the Twenty-fifth United
States Infantry, whose name has been
prominent in connection with the trag
edy.
She had told him, he declares, all the
circumstances of the differences that
led to the estrangement of her family
in Baltimore.
"My mother and I have fallen ' out
forever," said she, "and I have been
forbidden to return to my home In
Baltimore."
"Mrs. Chandler also confided to me,"
asserted Kirkman, "that her husband
owed everything to the Influence of
her relatives. Henry Gassaway Da
vis, Senator Gorman and Governor
Warfield procured Chandler's elevation
from the volunteer service to a lieu
tenant in the regular army. Never
theless, so Mrs. Chandler informed me.
while he was drawing full pay while
In the Philippines he only contributed
$80 to her support within the year and
that her relatives paid his debts. Rank
ing officers at Fort Crook know that
while he was there with the Thir
tieth he compelled Mrs. Chandler to do
the work of a common domestic serv
ant.
"I met Mrs. Chandler about the time
that they were going to Fort Riley.
Not long after this my hereditary men
tal troubles compelled me to enter a
sanitar'um In Brooklyn, N. T., and my
enemies at the fort then trumped up
the charges of unsoldierly conduct on
which I am now being tried."
Captain Kirkman admits he asked
Mrs. Chandler to marry him, but ex
plained that the proposal, whioh was
in writing, would be given to friends
and was not to- be submitted to Mrs.
Chandler untit she had been granted a
divorce from her husband. He declares
that his attempt to commit suicide was
simultaneous with hers and due to
despondency over not having heard
from her for over a week.
He concludes with the statement that
he will later have still more sensational
disclosures to make and names to give
of other people who are directly re
sponsible for Mrs. Chandler's death,
and that when he has done this he is
determined to follow her to the grave.
WASHINGTON. March 11.âSecre
tary Taft has declines to accept the
resignation of Captain George W.
Kirkman, Twenty-fifth Infantry, now
on trial by oourt-martial at Fort
Nlobrara, Neb., on charges of scandal
ous conduct. The court nas taken a
recess until May 10 to await the ar
rival of certain evidence from the

British Averse to Cremation.
The slow progress that Is being made
by cremation in this country must be
disappointing to its advocates as well
as surprising to the student of human
affairs. Twenty years ago the pioneers
of cremation naturally met with, a
gÂ«od deal of opposition, for we alter
our ideas on the aubjeet <)Â£ "pomp of
death" a good deal more slowly than
on the mere question of how to live.
But it was reasonable to expect that
in two decades - sentiment would have
capitulated to reason to a greater, ex
tent than has been the case. Unfor
tunately, as we think, the law courts
early stepped in and stereotyped that
sentiment â¢ before it had had time to
steady" itself. Dr. Tristram decided in
1594 that unless explicit instructions
had been left in the will an executor is
not competent to cremate his testator.
The ground of this decision was one
that already reads strangely, viz.: That
every one is entitled to Christian burial
and that cremation is not Christian
burial. .Thus it is that only those ,en
thusiasts for hygiene who make -'the
stipulations themselves come to be cre
mated?â London News. i ' '/: ' . ,

Andrew Carnegie

Fees of $64 40.
CLEVELAND, Ohio. March 9. An
drew Carneirie is now definitely out of
Ihe present trial of Mrs. Chadwick. If
she should be acquitted this time
Carnegie might appear at a subse
quent trial, but as far as the existing
case is concerned his pay is waiting
for him and he is at liberty to go
home.
United States Marshal Chandler to
day made out a check for $64 40 to
Carnegie's order and it is held in the
Marshal's office pending Carnegie's
call for it. If he does not call it will
be mailed to him.
The defense to-day made a desper
ate effort to have the case taken from
the jury and a verdict of acquittal
rendered by the court. After argu
ments lasting throughout the greater
part of the day Judge Tayler over
ruled the motion.
The defense also attacked two
counts of the indictment and asked
that certain parts of the testimony
offered by the Government be strick
en out. The acquittal of the defend
ant was asked for on the ground that
the indictment charged her with con
spiring to commit an offense against
the United States, in thnt she con
spired with Beckwith and Spear to
certify illegally checks of the Oberlin
bank. It was claimed by the attorneys
for the defense that Mrs. Chadwick,
not having been an officer of the bank,
could not have certified checks, and
that she could not be charged under
the law with having conspired to com
mit an offense in conjunction with
others which she had not the power
to commit alone.
Attorney Dawley, in closing for the
defense, asked that the letters submit
ted yesterday, in which Mrs. Chad
vick sought to make arrangements
for the certification of checks when
she had no money in the bank and as
-ult one check was certified sev
eral days before it arms, signed by Mrs.
Chadwick, be taken from the testi-
Judge Taylor, in deciding the motion
asking for the removal of the rase
from the jury, declared that the Court
of Appeals had, in the Scott case; cov
ered the questions raised by the de
fense and it was= therefore overruled.
The letters. Judge Taylor said, were
competent evidence. There was noth

ever been received by Spear or Beck

made by the prisoner, and he would al

OF THE WILD
Negro Missionary to Africa
Returns to Heathenism as
Chief of His Old Tribe
HUNTIXGTON, Ind., March 9.â The
executive committee of the missionary
board of the I'nited Brethren in Christ
has dropped from the rolls of the
church Daniel Flickinger Wilberforce,
a native African, who was brought to
Ihis country as a child and, after being
educated, was returned by the board to
his old tribe as a missionary. It is
charged by the bÂ«ard that after a ser
vice of twenty-five years as a mission
ary the negro minister had been lured
back to heathenism, has become chief
of his old tribe of devil worshipers
and has contrac-ttd plural marriages in
the wilds at Africa.
Nearly hlty years ago Dr. Daniel
Kumler Flickinger, then secretary of
the missionary board of the chu/ch,
was in West Africa on mission work.
While visiting a Congregational mis
sion announcement was made that a
male child had been born in the negro
village. The host of Flickinger chris
tened the baby Daniel Flickinger Wil
berforce. Twelve years later the boy
was brought to America by a returning
missionary and Dr. Flickinger acciden
tally discovered him at work at the
missionary house in New York. He
took the lad to Dayton, Ohio, and he
was sent to school, then through high
school and later to a medical college at
Cleveland.
He married a negress at Dayton and
the two went to Africa to do mission
ary work among the old tribe from
which Wilberforce came. Later the
family returned to this country and
Wilberforce lectured throughout the
Central States. His four children, two
sons and two daughters, attended Cen
tral College here. The two sons are
still in this country, one at Otterbern
College and the other in the Dayton
High School.
Wilberforce returned to Africa and
the board has been informed of his re
turn to heathenism and its accompany
ing plural marriages, together with his
becoming chief of his tribe. The ven
erable Dr. Flickinger is much depressed
over the backsliding of his protege, but
Banctior.B the action of the board.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. MARCH 10, 1905.
MILLIONS DIE
FROM PLAGUE
Astounding Figures Tell of
the . Ravages of Disease
Among Natives of India
CULCUTTA, March 9.â The deaths
from the plague last week numbered
34,000. Statistics show that the deaths
from bubonic plague in India within a
few years have reached nearly three
millions. In 1903 the mortality in India
from the plague alone was 850,000.
The infection recently spread to Bur
mah, where it is making rapid strides.
This season of the year always favors
its snread.
The Indian Government is making I
every effort to eradicate it, destroying 1
by burning whole sections of towns and
segregating the inhabitants. Owing to
the climate and the sanitary condition
of the outlying districts and native sec- .
tions of the towns, it is difficult to cope
with the epidemic, which breaks out
continually at fresh points.
The deaths are said to be ninety per !
cent of those infected. As a result of '
the plague the labor supply for the '
manufacturing centers has seriously
depreciated. So long has the plague I
existed that the native population in
India regards it callously.

OF IRISH HOME RULE

Country' to the Curse of a Dual

LONDON, March 9. â The question

Rosebery before the City of London
Liberal Club to-night. Rosebery said
that while the Liberal party sympa
thized with Ireland and was willing to
proceed along the lines of reform,
there was one thing to which no wise
statesman ever would expose the
country, namely, the curse of a dual
Government.
"We have sufficient warnings," said
he, 'in the example of Norway and
Sweden and Austria and Hungary to
avoid the peril of having the vulture
gnawing at our very vitals."

i Clarke (Wyoming), Foraker, Spooner
, and Kean.
Against the treaty â Morgan, Bacon,
Money. Clark (Montana) and Mc-
Creary.
The division of the Senate ommittee
on party lines caused considerable gos
sip among Senators as to whether that
division would be followed in the Sen
ate when the treaty was voted upon.
As the Senate stands now there are
fifty-six Republicans and thirty-one
; Democrats, with vacancies in Dela
ware. Missouri and Tennessee. It is
i expected also that two Republican
: Senators, Burton and Mitchell, will not
j vote and will not be paired on this
or any other matter coming before the
: Senate. As a two-thirds vote is neces
sary to ratify the treaty, it will re
quire fifty-eight votes to accomplish
this end.
Thr; Republican leaders in the Senate
still lack assurance of the full sup
port of their party. The Republican
Senators who do not give their com
plete assent base their opposition to
the treaty largely upon the ground that
it may prove a precedent in the future.
They concede that the conditions In
Santo Domingo are peculiarly exas
perating and agree that some relief ap
pears necessary, but they say that the
step now contemplated may be used in
the future fts Justification for a similar
move in a case in which the demand is
not so pressing.

DEATH SUMMONS
SENATOR BATE.
Close of am Eventful Life
WASHINGTON. March 9.â United
States Senator William Bromage Bate
of Tennessee, twice Governor of his
State, a veteran of both the Mexican
and Civil wars, rising from private to
major general in the Confederate
army in the latter, and for eighteen
years a conspicuous member of the
upper Hoi/se of Congress, died at his
hotel apartments in this city to-day.
He was 78 years old. Death was due
to pneumonia and heart trouble.
Senator Bate attended the inaugura
tion ceremonies on March 4, and his
death is believed to be due primarily
to exposure on that occasion. He suf
fered a slight chill on that day. He,
however, continued his official duties
and occupied his seat in the Senate
last Tuesday. He became suddenly ill
at the dinner table that evening and
immediately called for a physician. He
was put to bed and his condition was
recognized as serious.
Despite the efforts of his physician
he became steadily worse and all hope
for his recovery was given up yester
day. Senator Bate was entirely con
scious until his death and, realizing
that the end was near, asked that he
be buried at his old home in Nashville.
Besides the widow, two daughters,
Mrs. Thomas F. Masten of Tennessee
and Mrs. Childs of Los Angeles, sur
vive the Senator. A brother. Captain
Bate of Tennessee, and a sister, Mrs.
Harris, of California were sent for,
but were unable to reach here before
bis death.
Senator Bate's remains will be taken
to his old home at Nashville and will
be interred in the Mount Olivet Cem
etery there.
While in the Senate on Monday Sen
ator Bate talked with some of his Dem
ocratic colleagues concerning his plans
for the next session of Congress, which
related almost exclusively to the ques
tion of statehood for the Territories.
He adhered to his theory that there
should be another determined effort to
secure four new States, and announced
his determination not to yield to the
consolidation of Arizona and New Mex
ico under the circumstances.
NASHVILLE, Term.. March 9.â The
Tennessee Legislature will elect a suc
cessor to the late Senator Bate on
March 21, probably Governor Benton
McMillin. The Governor, who was
General Bate's most active opponent
during the last campaign, withdrew in
favor of Senator Bate, with the un
derstanding that should Senator Bate
retire he would become the candidate.
FAIR BUILDING MAY BE
MOVED TO WASHINGTON
Plan to Vse Federal Structure Now
at St. Louis for Inaugural
Balls.
WASHINGTON, March 9. â By the
removal of the Government building at
the St. Louis Fair to Washington the
capital city may have a great conven
tion hall and a permanent home for
the inaugural balls.
The members of the committee ap
pointed by the inaugural committee
of the Washington Board of Trade and
the Business Men's Association to con
sider the question of erecting in Wash
ington an auditorium met this after
noon. Commissioner West submitted
sketches of the steel work of the Gov
ernment building at St. Louis, together
with other data concerning the value
of the steel, which was stated to be
about $100,000. The cost of tearing
down the structure and transporting
the steel by freight to Washington is
piaced at about $20,000.
GAS COMPANY CREATES DEBT.â The
Consolidated Heat, Light and Power Company
yesterday filed a certificate for the creation of

cate states that the meney is to be used for
the erection of a gas generating plant in Vl
salla. and that no other company indebtedness
exists.

RENO, March 9.â Every saloon In
Nevada is wide open to-night and will

ed the measure repealing the 12 o'clock
closing law. The bill passed both
houses a few days ago after a hard
fight. The reform element of the State
bitterly opposed the measure. The act
will result to the advantage of the
saloon keepers of Tonopah, Goldfleld
and other camss as well as Reno.
Another measure vetoed by the Gov
ernor was one taxing national banks
in Nevada. The national banks, even
before the bill was introduced, refused
to pay taxes. The Governor's action
to-day practically relieves them from
taxation.

ARMIES NOW BATTLING FOR THE RAILROAD
Fate of . KuropatkitTs Shat

in St. Petersburg,
Gen. Ren nenkampffs Entire
Corps in Imminent Dan
ger of Capture.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 10. 3 a.
m. â St. Petersburg this mornins: knows
little more of the outcome of the bat
tle of Mukden than it knew on Wednes
day right, and little more of the fate
of Genera! Kuropatkin's beaten army.
li â  not oven known whether the rail
road has been cut and communication
destroyed, though it Is believed that
the re-ported destruction of the line by
General Oku's army refers to the dam
ejze inflicted on Wednesday, which was
not serious, though traffic was twice in
terrupted. It is evident, however, that
the Japanese are pressing closer to
this indispensable line of retreat. Their
shells occasionally cut the wires of the
â¢ .telegraph lints paralleling: the railroad.
end civilian linemen are displaying no
lets bravery than their soldier asso
ciates by climbing the poles and re
placing the wires, under fire.
The most important news received
from Russian sources is the informa
tion that the Japanese have already
reached the Hun River. Fu Pass is
only twelve miles east of Mukden and
. â well westward of General Linevitch's
line of retreat. Whether the extreme
Russian left has already succeeded in
retiring behind the Hun River and ,
moving down the north hank of that
ftream to Join hands with General
Kuropatkin's main force is not stated;
but it is extremely probable that, un
less the Russians are able to defend ,
the crossing at F-.i Pass. General Ren
nerikampff's corps and perhaps addi
tional forces will be cut off and have i
to shift for themselves in the moun- |
tainous region north of Fushun. against
expeditionary forces of Japanese which
are reported from Chinese sources to
be racing toward Tie Pass.
The censor allows no word to pass, j
but it v.as stated here yesterday that j
General Kuropatkin had been for some
time assembling a force of reserves at I
Tie Pass and at Harbin with this
eventuality in view, to defend the pass
ar.d positions until he could make or
fisht his way back.
Â» This is carnival week, according to
the Russian calendar; but the stern
hand of fate has moved the dial for- '
ward and plunged the city into Lenten
pioom and despondency. The pessimism
yesterday was even deeper than on
Wednesday. Many military officials are
openly speculating as to how lone the |
fragment of the once great army of !
Manchuria will be able â¢to hold the !
line on the Hun River and. if Field I
Marshal Oyama has actually succeeded j
in placing his trap, how lone it will j

sia i<= stea-lily reinforcing- her military

Sensational rumors of the dispatch of
; rt-inforcements fnr Russian Turkestan
j were current two months ago. but they
were then denied. The press is now in
i a position to affirm their truth, on
| the authority of a traveler of unim
; reachable veracity, who has just ar
! rived from Tashkend and who wag a
j personal witness of the military activ
ity on the recently completed Oren
burg-TnFhkend and of.ier strategic
railroads through Merv to Krasno
vodsk. Troops, guns and munitions of
. war have been moving southward for
;, two months. Between the middle of
; January and the middle of February
1 fifty-six military trains, mostly carry-
I ing nrtillery. arrived at Tashkend.
The Runs werp sent from Merv.
whence a purely military line goes to
Kursk. The traveler in question was
informed, although he had no personal
knowledge on the point, that Russian
tr"<>p? had crossed the Pamirs through
Terek Pass and garrisoned Kashgar.
The Orenburg-Tashkenrl railroad was
so crowded that the traveler was forced
to return by way of Krasnovodsk.
The press Informant states that the
greatest secrecy Is observed. Travel
ers, who are rare, must be provided
with special permits from the Minister
of Wor, and are kept under the closest
surveillance The baggage of this trav
eler was twice seized and searched, al
though his papers were regular.
.It is significant that local j officials
have been ordered not to permit Eng
lishmen to travel in Russian . Turke
stan, and captains on the Caspian have
bÂ»jen forbidden to allow. Englishmen to
land on the eastern shores. At
Krasnovodsk the informant of the
press was told that two English officers
who had been traveling in disguise
were' languishing in prison. ' ' -.". '
Speaking generally, the press inform-;
ant said that the greatest tranquillity
prevailed in the Turkestan region. At
Bokhara there were only vague ; rumors
that a war was in progress and abso
lutely nothing was known regarding
political' developments in European
Russia. The : only explanation of \ the
renewal of Russia's military . activity :
there is that it probably, is a demon
stration to impress Afghanistan. } 'â - :'-'â 
A Russian of nigh position to-day
made the following statement: -" ' ; . 'â¢
Russia has not any designs on India as
England Is Â«0 fond of alleging. If Great
Britain would only let us alone. we would not
trouble her. but we are not blind to the man
ner in whioh Great Britain has seized the oc
casion of the present war to buttress all her
Interests: nor can we Russian* (ret over the
Idea that, sooner or later, . a conflict with our
traditional enemy is Inevitable, and we realize
that our only path to victory lies in the direc
tion of India. Without going back to Lord
Cunon'e bombastic proclamations or anything
prior to the war, and nut of consideration for
the manner in which she ought to embarrass*
and discredit us In Its prosecution, we recall
what Great Britain has done in Asia since the
outbreak of hostilities p.nd ask whether Russia
would not be justified in making a counter move
to Younghusband's expedition to Tibet, which
was in direct violation of Great Britain's m>l

Mukden and the mastery of a great .

bullets; the tenth v day without sleep :

FIGHTING NEAR TOMBS.
MUKDEN, Wednesday. March 8, 10
a. m.-An artillery fire is now being
j directed from the vicinity of the an
; < i'-Mit northern tombs against the Jap- i
! affsse forces which are crowding to the
\ railway, where additonai troops are
j assembled to meet th's contingency.
{ The uarrc-w strip west of the railroad is
I literally covered by soldiers and mill- !
tary aecounterments.
The entire south front is now retir
ing, in conformity with a plan formu
lated upon the consequence of the j
day's fighting, and the Japanese, ap
prehending the movements, are them- j
selves rushing northward around the
Russian right.
Preceding; the retirement last night
I the heavy firing, which extended along j
I the entire south front, was for the first |
I time audible at Mukden throughout
the tntire night and increasing with
[ the dny as it arrproached the west and !
'north. It ought t<r be impossible now
for the Japanese to tun; the Russians j
I from the Hun River position, but the
| issue appears to depend entirely upon
' the extension of the battle line north
ward and up the railway.
COST OF THE DEFEAT.
The evacuation of the Shakhp posi- i
i tion involved several hundred miles of :
field and overland railways and te'.e- !
Riciphs. enormous defensive works, â¢
Reel Cross supplies, towns, fuel and
forage stores, the latter of which it ;
was necessary to burn. The military j
roads covered 500 square miles. The ;
smoke of battle and fires are every- :
where obscuring the lines and it is im
possible to longer distinguish the con- j
flagrations.
The hospitals here are now crowded,
; but the service continues adequate. I
Only sunlight and mildness of the '
weather prevent indescribable suffer- j
ing among the wounded and the sup- !
ports and reserves, who are obliged to !
dig deep on the wide, shelterless plain |
and lie widety extended tn order to I
escape the shrapnel which is sown i
broadcast for fifteen miles on the west,
while all the troops on nearly ninety
miles of battle line are constantly ex- |
posed.
15ENNENKAMPPT UNCONQUERED. |
MUKDEN, Wednesday, March 8. i
noon.â An artillery demonstration j
south of Mukden wu began at 10 '
o'clock on Tuesday night and the
evacuation of the entire Shakhe-
Machuntan position occurred at mid
night. General Rennenkampff, on the
east, who had been attacked eight con
secutive days and who had been hold
ing his own with other commanders,
desired to be permitted to remain in
the position. The Japanese are heard
advancing to the Hun. where the Rus
sians will have no difficulty in mak
ing a stand.
The telegraph is now at all times
threatened and this morning it was re
ported to have been broken.
WEIRD NIGHT REVIEW.
Troops File Papt Renncnkampff Be
fore Making an Attack.
GENERAL RENNENKAMPFF'S
HEADQUARTERS. Tuesday. March 7.
In pursuance to orders to retake at
any cost the positions at Oubenpensua,
lost at nightfall, the Russians at mid
night stormed and recaptured the hill*
in the center. A weird review pre
ceded the attack, as the regiments
st lected for this service filed past Gen
eral Rennenkampff in dead silence,
with pale, set faces, illuminated by the
rays of the moon. As the last set of
fours passed the general turned his
horse and departed, saying:
"Send me word when you succeed."
His confidence was justified, for
without a shout or the firing of a shot,
the storming column swept like a tidal
wave over the successive lines of Jap
anese covering the hills. Among the
Russian and Japanese dead on the
hills was a Japanese general in full
uniform.
RUSSIAN FORCE SURROUNDED.
Japanese Reported to Have Cut Off
Retreat to Tic Pass.
NEWCHWANG. March 9. â It is re
ported here that Tie Pass has been in
vested by the Japanese and that Gen
eral Kuropatkin, having no alterna
tive, will probably be forced to sur
render within a week. General Nogi's
army made a forced march of twenty
five miles daily and. acting In con
junction with General Oku's army,
hurrounded 80,000 Russians in the di
rection of Tie Pass and cut off their
supplies. The hurrying Japanese ar
mies passed a division of Russians
without giving it any- attention until
the enveloping movement was com
pleted, when they erushingly attacked
the Russians on all jrides.

BERUX, March 10. â Military
writers here, discussing General Kuro
patkin's situation, admit its extreme
seriousness/>ut do not believe a new-
Sedan will follow, arguing: that the
Japanese army is not heavy erteugh in
numbers to compel a surrender. Un
stinted praise is given F*ield Marsha!
Cnama's military achievements in the
present battle, but it is believed that
the territory over which the fighting:
has been going on is too enormous to
expect the Japanese to seriously plan
to surround the Russians.
PHANTOM BROWN ARMY.
General Kanamura's Force Has DU-
appearÂ«Â»d From View.
LONDON, March 10. â In the opin
ion of English military critics General
Kuropatkin's forces are doomed to
complete disaster. Careful study'of all
thf- possible avenues of escape and the
disposition of the. victorious Japanese
armies leads to the conclusion that
the best Kuropatkin can hope for 1? to
save a mere remnant of his army
devoting whole divisions to slaughter.
Much importance is attached to
General Kawamura's mysterious un
located army, which is momentarily
expected to complete the closing of
the net around the defeated host by
appearing somewhere in the extreme
east, in the neighborhood of Kingfan.
thus blocking the aole remaining rout*
from Kingfan to Tie Pass, through
Vmkiakou Pass.

OF POLITICIANS
Predictions That Governor
Pardee Will Soon Make
Out List of Appointees
PLACES TO BE FILLED
Learns: Citizens of Marin
umy Indorse J. H. Pryor
l>r Director of Prison
There is talk among the Republican
workers that the Governor will make
many appointments shortly after the
adjournment of the Legislature. The
lawyers incline to the opinion that the
selection of Judges for the new courts
of appeal has already been settled in
the mind of the Governor. Justices of
the Supreme Court entertain the hope
that the selections will soon be an
nounced.
The recommendations made to the
Legislature by ex-Senator Felton on
behalf of the State Board of Prison
Directors were received with so much
favor that the large appropriations
necessary for the improvement of the
prisons were granted. It is predicted
that the Governor will shortly an
nounce the appointment of at least one
new director, as it seems to be settled
that Robert T. Devlin, who was re
cently appointed United States District
Attorney, will resign from the Prison
Board. Indorsements of a very high
character on behalf of J. H. Prj-or of
Marin County have been placed be
fore the Governor. The term of J.
H. Wilkins of San Rafael will expire
next January. The term of Robert M.
Fitzgerald expired in January. 1904,
but his knowledge of prison affairs is
bo extensive that his associates ex
press the hope that he will remain on
â¢ thp board for at least one year longer.
The term of Dr. E. Z. Hennessey,
president of the board of managers
M the Xar>a State Hospital, expired in
July. 1004, and several of the poli
ticians of N ra County are making
a vigorous fight on the doctor
and predicting that the Governor
will turn him down. Reports from
Sacramento are to the effect that the
Governor has resolved to lift the
acyltun out of the slough of
Napa County politics. In June of
ths= year the terms of R. M. Swain
of Santa Rosa and F. W. Bush of
Napa will expire, making three places
on the board for the Governor to fill.
The term of Max Goldberg of San
Francisco will not expire until May.
190fi. There is talk to the effect that
the Governor may deem it advisable to
nppoint nt least one Democrat of Napa
County to the board of managers.

ADVERTISE^fEyTS.
AN EASY WAY
To Keep Well.
It ie easy to keep well if we -would
enly observe each day a few simple
rules of health.
The all important thins is to keep the
stomach right, and to do this it is not
necessary to diet or to, follow a set rule
or bill of fare. Such pampering simply
makes a capricious appetite and a feel-
ing that certain favorite articles of
food must be avoided.
Prof. Wiechold gives pretty good ad-
vice on this subject; he says: "I am 68
years old and have never had a serious
illness, and at the same time my life
has* been largely an indoor one, but I
early discovered that the way to keep
healthy was to keep a healthy stomach,
not by eating bran crackers or dieting
of any sort; on the contrary I always
eat. what my appetite craves, but daily
for the past eight years I have made it
a practice to take one or two of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal
and I attribute my robust health for a
man of my age to the regular daily use
of Stuart's Tablets. :
My physician first advised me to use
them because he said they were per-
fectly harmless and were not a secret
patent medicine, but contained only the
natural digestives, peptones and dias-
tase, and after using them a few weeks
I have never ceased to thank him for
his advice.
1 honestly believe the habit of taking
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after meals
is the real health habit, because their
use brings health to the sick and ail-
ing and preserves health to the well
and strong."
Men and, women past fifty years of
age need a safe digestive after meals
to insure a perfect digestion and to
v.ard off disease, and the safest, best
known and. most widely used is Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets.
They are found in every well regu-
lated household from Maine to Cali-
fornia and in Great Britain and Austra-
lia are rapidly pushing their way Into
popular favor.
AH druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, full sized packages at 50 cents,
and Hot a week stomach a fifty cent
package will often do fifty dollars'
worth vl good.

Espey'g race track gambling bill ia
said to be doomed to defeat if it ap
pears In the Senate. The measure pro
hibits bookmaking, pool-selling or
gambling of any kind on any race
track in the State. It passed the As
sembly without much opposition and
was sent to the Senate last Friday,
where it has been allowed to remain
with the Committee on Public Morals.
Espey tried to enlist the services of
some Senator to recall the bill from
the committee, but without success.
He has practically given up the fight,
inasmuch as he cannot get anybody to
"father" the biU in the Senate.
Two important measures which will
not reach flnal passage are those pre

SENATORS JOCULAR.
Enliven Last Days of Session by Intro-
ducing Fake Bills.
SACRAMENTO, March 9.â The mem
bers of the Senate cast serious thoughts
aside for a time to-night and indulged
in the pleasantries usually attendant
upon the closing of a session.
The fun was started when Senator
John Curtin of Sonora, a Democrat,
introduced what purported to be a bill
prescribing what shall be the qualifica
tions of a Gubernatorial candidate. In
mock seriousness the document laid
down qualifications, political and
otherwise, that could relate to no one
other than Senator Charles M. Short
ridge. As it is known that Shortridge
has the Gubernatorial bee in his bon
net the reading of the fake bill cre
ated much merriment.
Shortridge was called upon for a
speech. He responded in a vein of light
humor, provoking risibilities of his
associates and their guests. He also
referred to Senator Sanford, a possible
Democratic candidate.
This brought the Mendocino Senator
to his feet with a witty address. Sev
eral other Senators followed, among
them Wolfe, Ward and Curtin.
There were quips for Senator Bel
shaw and Lieutenant Governor Ander
son, each of whom is also regarded as
a possible candidate. Each responded
and the merriment was continued
throughout the evening, much to the
amusement of a large crowd.

WORLD'S FAIR OFFICIALS
INVOLVED IN SCANDAL
Alleged Collusion in the Sale of the
St. Louis Exposition
Buildings.
WASHINGTON, March 9.â Charges
of scandal are made in the affairs of
the St. Louis Exposition Company.
They concern the granting of awards
and also the salvage contracts by
which certain of the great exposition
buildings are to be removed. Senator
Thomas H. Carter, who has resigned
his place as chairman of the Govern
ment commission, said to-night that
one of the subject s to be considered by
the commission "involves alleged col
lusion in the sale of the exposition
buildings and all the property of the
exposition at what is said to be an in
adequate price received on a contract
made without fair competitive bid
ding."
"It is claimed by numerous parties,"
the Senator added, "that through the
failure of the exposition company to
fairly describe the property for sale a
profit of more than $1,000,000 was given
to favored bidders, which would in
volve a loss to the United States of
one-third of that sum."

MEN ORDERED
BACK TO WORK
National Leaders Take Hand
in Subway and Elevated
Strike in New York City
CLASH OF AUTHORITY
Many Take Their Old Places,
but Local Officers Show
a Disposition to Hold Out
YORK, March 9. â The most
interesting development in the sub
way and elevated railway strike in
New York to-day was the stand tak
en by some of the national labor lead
ers in repudiating the action of the
local leaders who ordered and are
conducting the strike. The first in
timation the . public had that the
strike was not indorsed by the na
tional unions came in a statement
from Grand Chief Warren F. Stone of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive En
gineers, to which the motormen be
long. Stone insisted that the strike
was a violation of the laws of the na
tional union, the men having broken
their contract with the Interborough
Company. He ordered the men to re
port for duty, failing which expulsion
from the organization is threatened.
W. D. Mahon. president of the
Amalgamated Association of Street
and Electric Railway Employes of
America, issued a statement to-night
similar in tenor to that issued by
Stone. President Mahon says the
strike was not authorized by the na
tional body and that the strikers must
go back to work.
DEFIES THE LEADERS.
Harry Johnson, secretary of the lo
cal union of Locomotive Engineers, in
an interview, says the men will not go
back to work until they have won
their point, the local union having
sufficient money to carry on the strike
without aid from the national uaon.
So far, he said, none of the strikers
had deserted, while dozens of the
strike breakers had quit and had been
sent home by the local union.
The Amalgamated Association of
Street and Electric Railway Employes
and the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers have issued a joint state
ment at strike headquarters, in which
they declare that Warren S. Stone did
not issue any statement to them this
afternoon ordering them to return to
work and declaring the national body
not in sympathy with their strike. The
statement says that the strike has just
begun; that the men will fight to the
bitter end and that they are confident
of winning.
Notwithstanding the efforts of the
local leaders, there were indications
around strike headquarters that at
least some of the men were ready to
give up the fight against the comptany.
Those who from the start were opposed
to the strike find the action of the na
tional leaders an excellent excuse to
return to work. Early to-night sev
eral of the old subway motormen were
found in charge of their regular trains
and admitted that they had taken
Stone's advice.
GOOD SERVICE IN SUBWAY.
The service in the subway to-night
was almost perfect, the local trains be
ing run during the rush hours on
schedule time, while the express trains
maintained a three-minute headway.
At no time was there anything resem
bling a congestion, the usual home
going crowds being handled without a
single accident. On the 'elevated lines
the service was not so good; this, how
ever, being due to the fact that the
company had decided to first perfect
the running of trains in the subway.
To-morrow they expect to bring the
elevated service up to the regular
standard.
Stone and W. B. Hurley left for
Cleveland to-night. As they were
leaving Stone said: "The strike is vir
tually over. We have accomplished
our mission and are going home well
satisfied."
At the offices of the company it was
said to-night that 300 of the old em
ployes had applied for reinstatement.
They were given application blanks
and told they would have to pass
through the same routine as the new
employes.
The Interborough Company also sent
out letters advising their employes to
appeal to the police when molested,
guaranteeing protection and also say
ing that all competent men would be
retained no matter what the outcome
of the strike, and those who had
worked during the trouble would have
preference of seniority, the seniority of
nil other employes to date from March
6, 1905.
LAWSON OFFERS REWARD
FOR BRIBERY EVIDENCE
Will Pay Ten Thousand Dollars for
Infprmation Asralnst Massa
chusetts Officials.
BOSTON, March 9.â Thomas W.
Lawson advertises in the local dailies
here to-day, offering $10,000 reward to
any person who will give him informa
tion which will lead to the conviction
of the 1903, 1904 or 1905 Massachusetts
Legislature or any Massachusetts offi
cial for having accepted a bribe in
connection with the Boston Gas affairs.
An additional $5,000 is offered any
person who will give Lawson informa
tion which will lead to the conviction
of any member of the Legislature of
1905 or any state official for accepting
a bribe in connection with any matter
other than gas affairs pending before
the 1905 Legislature.
This offer holds good to the close of
the present session. Apparently Law
son's information on gas briberies in
Boston is not as complete as he has
claimed.
WANTS NEW YORK TO ISE
THE COLORADO METHODS
Sherman Bell Suggests It as a Way
to Handle the
Strikers.
NEW /YORK. March 9.â Sherman
M. Bell, adjutant of Colorado, was the
principal speaker at the smoker of the
Phillips and Andover alumni to-day.
General Bell said:
"There are two things this country
has got to do; it has got to put an end
to strikes and get rid of politicians.
New York ought to use some of the
Colorado methods in this subway
strike. Wipe them out: put them out
of business; bust them upâ that is the
way I did with them, and that is the
only way to bring peace. They could
not arbitrate with me."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. MARCH 10. 1905
BEGINS FIGHT
FOR HIS LIFE
David Kiniry Faces a Jury
and Listens to Evidence
Branding Him as Murderer
HOW SMITH WAS KILLED
Policeman Cockerton Tells
of Hearing Shots and See
ing Flashes of Flame
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 9.
The trial of David Kiniry for the
murder of Policeman James Hume
Smith on the night of November 27,
11*0:1. was commenced to-day. The final
Juror needed to complete the list of
twelve men to listen to the evidence
in the case was secured at noon in
W. W. Walker of Alameda and the
jury as it now stands is composed of
the following men: George W. Shreve,
K. F. Phillips, Otto Niehaus, Carl
Krailing, Alfred H. Hay, Farley B.
Granger, J. A. Marshall. Justice Over
acker, C. A. Mc-Clain, A. P. Partridge,
John M. Creed. W. W. Walker.
With the completion of the panel the
tase was introduced. Deputy County
Surveyor P. A. Haviland was called
and identified a map made of the
streets in the vicinity of where the
crime was committed and gave a gen
eral description of electric lights,
fences, trees and the yards in that lo
cality.
He was followed by Police Judge
Mortimer Smith, who testified as to the
doath of his brother at the Receiving
Hospital from a bullet wound.
Then came the story of the shooting
by Policeman J. M. Cockerton. He
left the police station that night with
Policeman Smith, and together they
went to Thirteenth and Jackson streets,
where they separated. As he began
,the- recital of his story the spectators
"who have crowded the courtroom for
two days began to fill the passage
v.ays in order to obtain coigns of van
tage from which to view the proceed
ings. Judge Greene made an order to
have all take seats.
When Cockerton left Smith he went
south on Jackson street from Thir
teenth, while Smith went in the oppo
site direction. He had reached Tenth
street w*hen he was startled by pistol
shots. There were two in rapid suc
cession, then three more and in a few
seconds two more. He saw the flashes
of the la,at two shots and when he ran
up to the corner. he found Policeman
Smith lying face down on the steps of
the home of Charles E. Palmer at
Fourteenth and Jackson streets. He
was mortally wounded. Cockerton hur
ried up Jackson street 1 to see if pos
sible which way the fleeing robbers
went, and he stumbled over the form
of Goldstein on the grass of a side
walk near Fifteenth street.
'.'He ' recounted how he explored the
neighborhood and how he collected pis
s>ls; and other, evidence. There " was
nothing in his testimony, .. however, to
connect Kiniry with his story, r" <" ,
The next witness called was Dr. O.
D. Hamlin. In his testimony the doc
tor told of the wounds received by the
deceased and of his dying statement.'
The :., most important statement _, made
and one that goes to the very root of
the case was "Smith said as I was
talking to the- two men one stepped
back and fired, then I fired and I got
one of them, but it , was, not the one I
got that fired at me."
Klniry's hope of salvation' lies in the
fact that the prosecution 1 will not be
able to show that he fired the fatal
shot and that he will be able to show,
that Goldstein was the one who did it.
The statement of Hamlin may place
â¢the accused man's head in the noose.
An adjournment was taken until to
morrow morning. . v> H -

PRISONER GETS
LIGHT SENTENCE
Proctor, the Bunko Man Who
Preys Ipon Aged Widows,
Is (ruilty of Petty Larceny
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 9.
A verdict of petty larceny was
brought In this evening by the jury in
the trial of William Proctor, charged
with having withheld diamond rings of
aged Emily Tyson of Niles, which he
obtained from her after having pro
posed marriage. The jury evidently
placed their own value upon the rings,
which through an oversight they had
not been allowed to inspect, and esti
mated their worth at less than $100, the
sum necessary to sustain the charge
of grand larceny.
Proctor has been accused by old wo
men from all parts of the State with
having bunkoed them. It was expected
that if the sentence had been left to
the judgment of the court he would
have spent a term of years in one of
the State's penitentiaries. As it ia,
however, th^ sentence ia limited to six
month*; In the County Jail.
Th'-re Is another charge against Proc
tor. He Is accused of embezzlement in
having induced the old lady to give
him $108. but tfrere is considerable
doubt ac to whether the evidence la as
strong ac In the case of the rings.

OAKLAND, March 9. â The munici
pal election in Oakland will take
place next Monday. Up to the present
time the only meetings that have been
J held have been by the Republican
J party, no other party having arranged
j a gathering.
The Republicans to-night held three
meetings, one at W>st Oakland, one
in North Oakland and one in the First
Ward. w. J. Hennessey acted as
chairman at the West Oakland meet
ing and Police Judge Mortimer Smith
was chairman of the North Oakland
meeting. There were addresses by the
nominees of the Republican party,
Frank K. Mott, the Republican nomi
nee for Mayor, being the principal
speaker at each meeting.
To-morrow evening the campaign
will be wound up with a general meet
ing at the Dewey Theater, which will
! bo addressed by S. M. Shortridge, be
sides the candidates. Mr. Mott to
night outlined his policy in a strong
speech, in which he said:
Coming back to West Oakland again, to say.
a few words at the close of the municipal cam
paign, where I had the pleasure of addressing
my old friends and neighbors in the first
speech of the campaign. I am more than ever
imi-reesed with the serious responsibility that
attaches to the position for which I am the
nominee- of the -Renubllcan party of Oakland.
It is perhaDS with pardonable pride that I re
call, the days of my boyhood in this western
end of the city, for here it was I got my start
in l#e, and here it was. too. that I formed
many of the stiong; friendships that have

is- greater, too, when . 1 remember that I am a
Republican. That mea#B to be a follower of

BIG MEETINGS
OF CHRISTIANS
Evangelistic Services Are
Attended by Large Crowds
of Oakland*s Citizens
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 .Broadway, March 9.
The evangelistic services being held
in this city are growing and each day
and meeting shows an increased at
tendance. In every part of the city
meetings are being held day and night.
A pathetic incident was recorded at
this afternoon's meeting held under
the auspices of the evangelist Henry
Ostrom at the First Methodist Church.
After his meeting was over he wa*
approached by four blind girls from
the Berkeley Blind Home, who asked
him if he thought if they prayed hard
enough that they could recover their
sight. The earnest sincerity of the
helpless girls touched those who heard
the question and the great leader him
self was baffled for the moment. He,
however, instanced the cases of Helen
Keller and Fanny Crosby, the noted
blind women song writers, and told
them that though they were blind they
could do (iod'a work and he sent them
away searching for light through faith.
The first of the evening gatherings
was an open-air meeting at Eleventh
and Washington streets, presided over
by J. H. McComb. This meeting ad
journed to the First Congregational
Church and took part in the services
beiHg conducted by J. Wilbur Chap
man.
At the First Presbyterian Church
three prayer meetings in different parts
of the church building were held at
7:15 o'clock, and at 7:30 they fill joined
the main gathering held in the audito
rium. This meeting was led by Henry
Ostrom. John P. Hillis, soloist and
chorister, charmed the audience by his
rendition of 'Love of Jesus" and other
hymns.
At the Twenty-third-avenue Baptist
Church, in East Oakland, W. H. Stough,
with W. H. Collisson as soloist, presid
ed over a crowded meeting; at the
Eighth-avenue Methodist Church a
meeting was conducted by R. A. Wal
ton, with O. F. Pugh as soloiat; at the
Chester-street Methodist Church, in
West Oakland, John H. Elliott presided
and Charles E. Rykert, soloist, held a
large audience spellbound.
According to a statement made by J.
Wilbur Chapman to-day, the meetings
here are equaling those held In Los
Angeles and are Increasing dally. By
next week it 1p predicted the churches
will not be able to accommodate the
multitudes.
The programme for to-morrow's ser
; vices is as follows:
12:25â N00n meeting-, S. P. R. R. shop*.
2:l6â First Methodlit Church. J. H.

is the way to strengthen the hands of our
leaders. That Is the way to build. That Is
the way to win the confidence of the people In
political battles. That Is the way to win
Tight up the line.
If you are a Republican and your party pre
sents honest, tried. Intelligent, trustworthy
men for your suffrages, vote for them. That
Is one way to make your party strong and re
spected, and it Is one way to express your be
lief in the great work that Is being done under
the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt. Hie in
auguration last Saturday as the twenty
seventh President of the United State* marks,
I believe, the opening of an epoch In our na
tion's records the like of which will not have
been equaled in many years to come. It will,
I a*n confident, be such an administration aÂ»
will be blazoned upon the landmark* of his
tory so deeply that in all time the lessons shall
not be forsrotten. See to it that we do our
share as Republicans. If we do. we may be
assured the reward will be a just one â name
ly: gCMxI government at the hands of good citi
zens. And more than that, it will be Â»n en
couragement and an Inducement for afl good
citizens to seek to s4t In the public places
that they may lend their helping hands toward
furthering this mighty work.
You know my feelings on the subject of good
government. It goes without payintt that I
shall do all that I can to discharge the duties
of the office of Mayor to the best of my abil
ity. This is a trite saying in politics, but It
le full of meaning to the man who Is conscien
tious. The duties of Mayor are many and are
important. He can exercise them and con
tribute largely to the general good. He can
suggest, he can advice, he can approve and he
can disapprove. With a legislative' council and
executive boards in harmony with him. his
work can be lightened and his policies can be
maintained I'nder such conditions he can ac
compllish a great deal for the city. It I* under
such conditions I should like to serve my city
as ite Ma\or. It Is under such conditions as
these that I hope to serve my city as Its
Mayor.
In carrying out seme of the ideas that gen

Importance of liberal provision i->r street im

sanitary, utilitarian and esthetic ;>eint.Â« of

idly in this direction. At ali tlmÂ»s bearing in

deavor to trim our municipal cloth in order to

BULLET STOPS
CHICKEN THIEF
University Professor Kills

in His Poultry Preserves
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, March 9.
Grief stalks to-day through the halls
of the Sigma Nu fraternity house on
Le Conte avenue and the members of
the Greek letter "frat" go about re
fusing to be comforted. Professor A.
C. Wright of the engineering depart
ment of the university has killed their
pet coon, an animal famed throughout
the length and breadth of the univer
sity town for his many accomplish
ments, t
The Sigma Nu coon lost his life last
night through an inordinate fondness
for the meat of chickens, particularly
the fowl kept by Professor Wright at
his home, 1632 Euclid avenue.
Professor Wright has missed a num
ber of his chickens during the last
month and for some time has kept
Wfctch at night for the thief who in
vaded his poultry yard. He suspected
human thieves and was prepared to
give depredators a scare. Last night
he was on watch and his vigilance was.
rewarded by the sight of the Sigma
Nu coon creeping into the poultry
house. One bullet sufficed for the fra
ternity pet and he fell in his tracks.
News of his demise was conveyed to
the fraternity men. who buried his re
mains with ceremony to-day.
This is the second chicken-stealing
episode in which fraternity men have
figured during the last week, the Phi
Gamma Delta men having been ac
cused on Sunday last of appropriating
six hens from Mr. Shaw, their neigh
bor, on Dana street.

Joseph Quinlan. the Owner
of Albemarle, Is Koujrhly
Handled by a Pistol User
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway. March 9.
Joseph Quinlan, a horseman, owner
of Albemarle and other racers, was
knocked senseless and robbed last
night of $300 in coin and a check for
$400 while on Park avenue, Emery
ville, near the town hall. Quinlan
was cut badly on the head by the
force of several blows from a revol
ver's butt, wielded by a footpad, who
accosted him suddenly on the side
walk. When the horseman regained
consciousness he staggered to West
lake's drug store. Park and San Pab
lo avenues, where Dr. Legault treated
the injuries.
Quinlan s hesitation when he was
commanded to throw up his hands by
the armed highwayman, who shoved a
pistol at the rn^an, caused the robber
to swing heavily upon Quinlan's head,
following the smashing blow with two
more that left the victim insensible
on the ground. The horseman report
ed the robbery to Town Marshal Ca
rey, but could not give a good de
scription of the footpad because of
the darkness. The robber left noth
ing in Quinlan's pockets but his
watch. It is supposed he did not take
the timepiede fearing the authorities
might be able to trace him by it.

Convicted Sergeant Makes a
Confession During Trial
of the Chief of Police
PKOECUTION CLOSES
Defense Will Begin Intro
duction of Testimony at
Meeting on Monday Night
I
The prosecution in the case of Chief
of Police Wittman, charged with
neglect of duty and incomuetency,
came to a close before the commission
ers last ultfrt. With the exception of
Miir.uny of Sergeant Kllis the
â¢vtde&oe amounted to very little. The,
ieatun in the testimony of Ellis was a
voluntary confession that he had noi
done his duty whil* detailed to duty in
ihe Chinese quarter, but he implicated
be MM and admitted that even the
men under him were ignorant of his
dereliction, ihe defense will benm its
n Monday night.
Ellis was oahf-d to the witness stand
and had evidently sent word to the
commissioners previously that he de
sired to make a statement. Before he
was permitted to do so, however, he
was asked a few unimportant ques- ,
tions, at the conclusion of which he
claimed his privilege.
"1 believe, " said the sergeant, who
has already been convicted and who
is awaiting sentence, "that 1 was ask
ed at the last meeting nf the board if
1 had done my whole duty in suppress
-ambling in Chinatown. I then de
clined to answer and on that point I
desire to make a statement."
"You are at liberty to do so." said
one of the commissioners.
"Then I will reply that I did not do
my full duty."
Ellis is known to have confessed be
fore the Grand Jury, but had refused
to give the commissioners any infor
mation concerning that testimony or
to make any admissions of guilt, so
that thlp confession came as a com
plete surprise. The audience awaited
further developments, but none came.
Ellis was not even asked why he
neglected his duty and the first ques
tion that broke the silence after his
reply was concerning something else,
thus losing the matter. Ellis then
admitted that a sergeant of police and
<-n. while th^y might not be able
-ambling < ntirely. could
to such an extent that little
f OÂ« w.uid exist in the district.
Jemme Millard. an interpeter. claim
ed that he had seen policemen sittine
around in front of gambling places
while fames were being played. i>n
'-mat ion Millard admitted he
had been arrested for vagrant
hanging around police courts and
'tipping-" cases to attorneys and that
ht had blamed Chief Wittman for his
arrest. William D. Hoboke, a plumber,
and Hugo Smith knew hut little of the
gambling and when they had finished
Policemen Charles Munn, Henry Mc
<;rath and William Doran of Serjeant
Ellis' squad were called and gave the
Fame testimony as at the previous
ns. Ellis followed and the oom
ners announced that the wit
â  the prosecution were ex
hausted and that the defense could
â  take up its case Monday night.

As the automobile chugr-chugged
along that division of Clay street ex

its chauffeur slowed speed and sound
ed warning toots until the crowd of
men loitering in front of an employ

right of way was Frank Rectral, and
as he reluctantly did so he addressed
broken German insults to the people
in the vehicle.

a soiled fist at the vanishing auto.

vanced, and he also hinted that the
peace was being disturbed. To which
Mr. Rectral retorted by designating
the policeman "an aigend of Mem
mon" and declaring intention to speak
when, where and as loudly as he
pleased In this land of the free. Then
he was arrested.
"Dose autermabibblers vas noo

Rectral, by way of defense, to his
Honor Conlan.

questionably are," was the response,

Charles Phillips, charged with hav
ing created a disturbance in a house
of death, was pronounced guilty of
battery by Judge Cabanlss and will be
sentenced to-day. The landlady of
an apartment-house on Van Ness ave
nue demised on Tuesday and her re
mains were in the house when Phil
lips, who had formerly resided there,
entered and proceeded to the room
formerly occupied by him, where he
acted like one frenzied. When the
dead woman's daughter. Mrs. Natalia
Anderson, and her husband went to
remonstrate the madman struck them.
His defense was that while passing by
the house he was called an uncompli
mentary name by some one and he
was searching for the offender when
Mrs. Anderson and her spouse under
took to eject him. He pleaded Ignor
ance that there was a corpse in the
house.
Clem Jenkins, a well known Jockey,
was battling with Tim Murphy, a race
track follower, at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning on Ellis street, near Powell,
when Patrolman Meredith stopped the
game by arresting Mr. Jenkins, the
other fighter escaping. The officer told
Judge Mogan that the "scrap" was ap
parently conducted in approved prize
ring fashion, as there was a referee, a
timekeeper and also a squared circle
<,f deeply interested spectators. Mr.
Jenkins displayed a black eye and the
policeman did not know whether Mr.
Murphy's countenance t>ore marks of
punishment. Consideration of the fact
that Mr. Jenkins had received facial
damage and was the only combatant
captured prompted the Judge to dis
miss the case.

Delfino Cherotti declared he was
DteCeiy trying to drag his younger
brother to night school when a police
man arrested him at Broadway and

Fred Bridges, handsome, intelligent
f and a confirmed inebriate, was given
six months by Judge Mogan for
vagrancy. Bridges owned a prosperous
livery stable when King Alcohol in
sidiously enslaved him, and for sev
eral years he has been living in squalor
and spending for drink the money his
former associates gave him to buy food.
It was their suggestion that he be
given the maximum penalty for vag
rancy, their intent evidently being to
have him removed beyond temptation
to drink until he can recover his man

John Kilroy of 214 Rltch street did
not consider himself de trop while his
wife was being visited by Mrs. Mary
Bray of 78X Harrison street, and his
presence in the sitting room -was rather
annoying to Mrs. Bray, who had some
thing to communicate to Mrs. Kilroy
that was not intended for masculine
hearing. So the ladies retired to an
adjoining apartment, leaving Mr. Kfl
roy and Mrs. Bray's satchel, contain
ing a purse which In turn contained
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. MARCH 10, 1905.
$55, together. Not until after she de
parted from the Kilroy domicile did
Mrs. Bray discover that the purse and
its contents had been abstracted from
the satchel and she immediately sus
pected Mr. Kilroy of theft and caused
his arrest by Detectives Regan and
O'Connell, who, hc-*ever, failed to find
the missing cash.
In the court of Judge Mogan, where
Mr. Kilroy stood charged with larceny,
the defense contended that Mrs. Bray's
accusation was uncalled for, inas
much as Mr. Kilroy was the father of
three and noted for his observance of
the rules of hospitality, which he could
not possibly have violated by robbing
a guest of his house. Further defen
sive pleading will be heard to-day.
Mrs. S. L. Macomber, a rheumatic
invalid, was carried into Judge Mogan's
cc-urt to testify against her husband,
arrested for beating her and smashing
some of their household furniture with
a hammer. But the sorely afflicted
wnmun requested the Judge to dismiss
the case, as the defendant was her
only means of support.
Then up spoke Mrs. Kinney, on
whose complaint the arrest was made.
She lodged in the home of the Ma
combers, at 338 Twenty-fourth ave
nue, and she recounted many acts of
cruelty to which the defendant had
subjected his crippled wife. "She ac
quired the rheumatism that made her
lame," Mrs. Kinney averred, "by
spending nights out of doors after he
had driven her forth. But she never
complained. This man should be
punished, Judge, for he is a brute, and
if he is sent to jail I'll see to it that
his wife is given better care than he
ever gave her."
"I"m sorry," responded the Judge,
looking at the defendant, "that Cali
fornia has not adopted the Delaware
law that punishes wife-beaters by
whipping. But I can send you to Jail
for six months when you come here
to-morrow for sentence, and maybe
when that term has expired another
sentence will be ready for you." â¢
Macomber is a carpenter and a
drunkard. His wife contributed to
the housekeeping by caring for Mrs.
Kinney's children.

station. Word to this effect has been
received from Senator Perkins, who
has received an intimation from Sec
retary Wilson that orders have already
been issued for the establishment of
the station.
The establishment of this station will
prove of great benefit to fruitgrowers,
as the forecast at San Francisco does
not closely apply to this county. Mau
rice O'Connell, an observer in the Sac

the San Jose station. It is believed
that the big electric tower in this city
will be used to flash the weather sig

this valley.
DX. GJSOBQE ADAMS SPEARS
AT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Business Men Attend Noonday Service
ami Devoutly Pray and Sing
Hymns,
Dr. George C. Adams, pastor of the
First Congregational Church, ad
dressed a large body of business men
at the noonday service yesterday in
the' Chamber of Commerce.
Samuel Mayer presided at the or
gan and the singing of the hymns by
a choir and the worshipers could be
heard throughout the vast building on
California street. As persons bent on
business ascended to offices they were
attracted by the harmonious volume
of sound and to those who looked in
at the hall it seemed as though a
church had been transplanted there.
There were heads reverently bowed
and knees bent during solemn prayer
and blessing was asked for the wor
shipers and others.
In the course of his profound re
marks Dr. Adams said:
The word on which the Savior places the
most emphasis la the fifteenth chapter of
Ji hn is "abide." It means â in Greek and
lvatin, as it dvi's In English- â to stay. The
S:\vlor illustrates It by the relation of the
brunch to the vine and we know that the
branch jeoes to the heart of the vine.
He speaks in the Imperative mood because
we have freedom of the will and we can choose
to p.bide.
HKH X promises that if we abide we shall bear
fruit. The Intimate association of two In
dividuals through a Inng time leaves the Im
press of one character upon the other. So
that he who abides In Christ must in time
show the character of Christ.
The Rev. A. C. Bane will speak at
the noonday service to-day and the
Rev. Ernest E. Baker. D. D., to-mor
row. On Monday the Rev. John
Homphill. D. D., will be the speaker.

DEATH LAYS BARE
MAN'S DOUBLE LIFE
Two Wives Meet
at Bedside of
Husband,
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 9.â John
Williams, for many years a respected
resident of Wilmington, died at the
County Hospital to-day after a death
bed scene which established the fact
that for years he had been a bigamist
and had led â Â« double life, supporting
two women, neither of whom knew of
the existence of the other.
Williams was taken to the hospital a
week aero suffering from an incurable
disease. He was visited there by a
woman whom he recognized as his wife.
Yesterday another woman appeared
and also claimed to be the wife of the
dying man. She produced a marriage
certificate to support her claim. Know
ing that something was wrong the
hospital authorities so arranged mat
ters that the two women were brought
together at the same time. When con
fronted by both women Williams ad
mitted that he was a bigamist. He
had lived with one of the women for
nearly fifteen years, having met her
in Wales. The other woman he had
married in this county and had sup
ported her.
In order to make all possible restitu
tion he deeded all his property to the
woman he had married last, his first
wife being well provided for in her
own right. The women positively re
fused to give their addresses as they
left the hospital together, saying that
the world should never know that their
mutual husband was other than the
reputable citizen he was known to be
by his neighbors at Wilmington.

TOURIST TRAVEL.
I*" 1 *Â»E .two Jkinds.of travel to California arc mw apparent all over
I the State. The home-seekers, induced by cheap railway rates; â 
are appearing in the country towns, and arc looking with all.
eyes at the vernal landscape. These travelers come with a purpose
beyond the pleasures of the trip. They want to study the State as
a. place, in which to permanently settle. '' Fortunately there are
everywhere local organizations and auxiliaries of the State Board
of Trade, whose members know the unwisdom of having discontented
settler*. They know that any deception as to the. quality of land or
ether â  j.-lrysjcal feature? is sure to cause sucli discontent. Therefore
it ts. made, practically impossible- that speculators shall nullify the
sreor! offect of tliis influx of heme-seckers. and the State will get the
benefit -of the_ permanent settlement of such of them as yield to he i
lure of "the- opportunity offered' for the. betterment of their condition.
Trie other class of travelers are the pleasure seekers,, those who i
arc expelled from their Eastern homes by the harsh winter and the !
wintry spring. These yearly seek a sojourn in . San Francisco in !
greater numbers. The novelties of this city appeal to them. It is
more cosmopolitan than any other American city. Heretofore some- !

pleasure places arc execr.ted and the results are added to what we al- {

j I I*I '* one ey* on Dicky Johnston^
â  Dicky, had shown signs of
v.?mdering away from the fold and
must be brought back. It was de
cidedly against Melissa's creed to al
liv\ another girl to receive even an
iota of admiration from one of her
coieri-e.
There was a girl belonging to the
h<>use pai'o, a blonde, Melissa
thought contemptuously, who had re
ceived entirely too much attention
f'om Dicky:
Therefore he must be disciplined.
His lesson must be decided at once,
and to the point. Having decided
upon this Meilssa gave her pea one
conclusive nibble and commenced
writing: hurriedly. As there happened
to be no one in the library at the lime
except Dicky and herself his attention
was soon attracted by the aggressive
scratching of her pen.
"Why don't you stop and amuse a
fellow. ' he urged. "What are you
v 1 iting?"
"< *h- â Jusi wriiiug," she replied,
a lily, her tone insinuating that there

&JOl).
"To a man?" he asked, sulkily.
"A very charming man." she assured
him impressively. "It 1 * rather an im
portant communication." she con
tinued. "I wish you would look over
this page and see if it is too stilted."
Dicky took it- up with relieved alac
rity, but his lace lengthened visibly as
lie read:
"1 have decided that I will marry
you â i don't know why 1 hesitated.
If you can get away from town for a
day. take the Kderton local for Mrs.
\v imberly's country place and you can
tell me Ifâ you are glad I didn't keep
;ou waiting any longer."
Dicky handed it back and com
nunced a study of the library fire.
"I don't see how any one could pofl
sibl> call that stilted." he growled.
Melissa signed the note, sealed it
and directed it to Dr. John Hartly.
Considering the fact that Dr. Hartly
only a very casual acquaintance
and had never asked Melissa to marry
h'm, nor had she ever dreamed of his
asking her to do so, this literary
achievement might be regarded as
rather theatrical.
She gathered up her writing ma
terials, slipped the letter into her writ-
Ing pad and started for the door.
Stepping a minute to fluff up her
brown pompadour, she fixed a re
proachful eye upon the object of her
vengeance.
"I never would have thought,
Dicky." there were volumes of sur
prise in her voice, "that you would
have cared anything at all for
blondes," she went out and shut the
door rather decidedly.
As nhe crossed the hall the letter
slipped out and fell to the floor, mak
ing no sound on the soft rug. She
went upstairs, unconscious of her loss,
smiling in antu ipation of the lnter
vitw she would have with Dicky when
hifc repentance had reached a proper
depth. It was Melissa's theory, gained
in her twenty years, that men needed
to be taught lessons occasionally.
When Dicky had learned his lesson
fhc would acknowledge that she had
noi yet sent the letter, but was keep
ing it for further consideration.
The footman, coming for the letter
bag a few minutes later, was uncon
scious of the inner workings of Me
lissa's mind. He picked up her letter
ami posted it with the others.
Two evenings later the maid
brought Melissa Dr. Hartly'* card. "I
t'M-k him to the library, miss. He
said --he could only stay a few minutes
and wanted to gee you alone."
Melissa went down stairs, her fore
head puckered into a wondering
frown. She could not imagine why
Dr. Hartly had come to Ederton to
talk with her about anything.
He came forward to meet her, and
she felt a little constrained in her
greeting of this man of forty, who
seemed so different from Dicky and
the others.
"I'm. so glad you decided to marry
me," he said cordially, his eyes twink
ling. "I hoped some woman would

some day. You see, 1 have been so
busy â I rather neglected it."
Melissa gasped with astonishment.
"Who said anything about my mar
rying you?" she finally managed to
say, her eyes round with surprise.
He took her note from his Inside
pocket, adjusted his eye-glasses and
looked at it carefully.
"I certainly hope I have not been
mistaken," he said, handing it to her.
Two large tears rolled down her
cheek. "I don't know how on carth â
I thought this was upstairs in my
writing pad," she said miserably. "It
was just a joke to tease Dicky â I â
oh â I never was so ashamed in my
whole life," she said, dropping intu a
big library chair and hiding her face
against its back.
He walked behind the chair, and,
leaning on it, looked down smilingly
upon the brown head that rose and
fell with each sob.
"I knew there was some kind of
joke connected with it, child." he said
soothingly. "There was obliged U? be
some joke about the fact that a girl
your age would dream of man ying â
an old man like me."
"I don't think you are â old," came
in muffled tones from the padded back
of the chair.
"I knew it was a joke," he resumed,
"but it seemed ratherâ pleasant.
Somehow I had an irresistible desire
to come and see, â why you did it."
Melissa's face was still hidden.
"I wouldn't have you Reel mortified
about it for the world," leaning over
until his lips touched a stray tendril
of her hair that shone red-brown on
the black leather chair back. "I am
twice as old as you, little girl, but I
am young enough to understand a
joke. Do you feel all right about it
now?"
The brown head nodded in a com
forted manner.
'And yet, Melissa, 1 can't help re
alizing how nice it would be â if it
were not a joke. If there ever comes
a day when you could possibly mean
it â won't you send it back?"
The figure was as still as the chair
that held it, and Hartly sighed as he
turned off.
"Never mindâ of course you could
not. I'll say good-by now, and catch
the nine o'clock train for town. Won't
you' shake hands to show we under
stand each other?"
Melissa blindly held out a wavering
hand that he grasped In his big one.
His expression changed with light
ning rapidity, for there could be no
doubt about it â the girl had gently
RELIGION
IN THE
NOVEL
Hall Came, the brilliant novelist,
contributes to the March number of
the Booklovers' Magazine a very
strong plea for the novel as an ethical
force. 'I rebel with all the strength
of my soul," he says, against the
shallow opinion, so current, that the
novel is a puppet show as unmoral as
Punch and Judy and as completely
void of moral responsibility." The
novel, as Mr. Came conceives it, must
deal with life as a whole and with its
deepest problems. Among these lat- .
ter religion is easily supreme. Hence
the novelists treatment of it should |
be didactic, though it should not be
bald or controversial. It must "unite
the simplest pictures of life with the
deepest problems of humanity." On
this ground Mr. Came defends his use
of biblical subjects. He deliberately
chose as his themes "the great leg
ends that have endured since the be
ginning of the world" as far more
substantial foundations for stories
than any merely fictitious plots. Pic
tures of "the human comedy," Mr.
Came argues, cannot leave out of con
sideration such a vital constituent as
religion; and even if, as in the works
of Charles Dickens and Charlotte
Bronte, the hypocrisies of professors
of religion be mercilessly exposed,
" the net result can only be good for
religion itself, inasmuch as it must
help to purify religious life." Much
less should the shortcomings of the
clergy be spared on the ground of
lowering the atmosphere of reverence
in which the clergy should be held.
That would be to put a gloss on what
soever things are untrue, dishonor
able, unjust, impure and of evil re
port. For religious novels ought not
to be mere sermons or philosophical
tractates thinly veiled, but parables
"wherein the mind is above all things
fixed upon the fact." Incidentally Mr.
Came pays his respects to traditional â¢
theology and says that "the doctrine
of 'objective redemption' has been the :
occasion of grievous temptations in
the history of the church and, if a
layman dare to say so, the theory of i
conversion' as it is taught in these
days by nearly all the evangelical .
branches of the Christian church, ,
from the Roman Catholic to the Sal
vation Army, seems to be in danger
of concealing the true meaning of re
ligion, in so far as it allows itself to
adopt that free and easy attitude to j
past transgressions which has always ',
been a snare." This he says In reply
te Dr. Clifford, who charged him with
emphasizing the doctrine of doom to
the exclusion of the doctrine of grace.
Finally, Mr. Came predicts that the]
novel will be the greatest ethical ,
teacher of the future, because its ca- !
pacity for influence is unlimited.
"There Is no pulpit." he says, "with ,
a sounding-board that will send the
human voice so far."*
pressed into his palm the note that
had been concealed in her hand.
"Melissa!" he exclaimed, unbeliev
ingly, seating himself upon the arm of
the big chair.â (Copyright, 1905, by F.

POLICE JUDGES
AND LENITY TO
THE CRIMINALS
To the Editor of The Call:
As a faithful reader of The Call I
have' noted the marked increase of
burglary, robbery and footpadism in
Ban Francisco within the last six
monthsâ the usual winter harvest of
felonies. Your paper abounds in re
ports of these crimes.
I have counted flfty-Â»ix reported
cases of hold-ups and incidental beat
ings and maimings, thirty-seven of
burglary, and many of vandalism and
depravity. Contrary to their former
habits, the footpads now nsually beat
their victims, often fracturing skulls,
breaking ribs, etc. These inhuman
crimes are of almost daily occurrence.
So inadequate is the judicially aban
doned police force to suppress this
reign of crime that there has been talk
of forming a vigilance committee.
Permit me to call your attention to
the remarkable fact that every po
liceman of experience, every police re
porter in San Francisco, and every
police court lawyer knows thafc the
criminals of this city have so strong a
pull with the police courts that it is
folly for patrolmen to make arrests.
Men on the force have been disciplined
and even "broken" for making certain
arrests.
About two weeks ago, for an ex
ample of the uncertainty and inade
quacy of Judicial discipline, Judge Ca
baniss discharged a man who had fe
loniously taken a woman's purse con
taining $76. The prisoner chanced to
own a small store, so he refunded the
$75 and was dismissed, though he had
spent most of the money and thrown
the purse away, having found it in
the "side room" of a restaurant, from
which he hastened with guilty intent
lest the owner return and claim her
purse. What encouragement was that
dismissal to the policeman who made
the arrest and lost his sleep to prose
cute the criminal? Was it not the
compounding of crime to permit such
a settlement?
I find in The Call of to-day this "item:

MILK DRIVERS
FEAR TROUBLE
Xew Corporation Founded by
Cornelius 3iay Be Placed
Under Ban hv Workmen
The I^abor Council will hold an ex
ecutive session this evening to dis
cuss th^ impending trouble between
the members of the Milk Drivers"
Union and the newly formed Co-oper
ative Milk Company, recently estab
lished by Richard Cornelius, president
of the Carmen's Union. From present
indications it looks as if trouble is
brewing.
The Dairyroen'B Association only re
cently renewed its agreement with the
union on hours and pay for another
year. There is an unwritten clause
in the agreement that the drivers will
not go to work for the opposition
company. Thus far Cornelius has re
fused to sign an agreement with the
drivers and it is whispered m union
labor circles that the latter's concern
is very likely to be boycotted unless
the Labor Council takes some action
in the matter to-night.
The members of the Waiters' Union
are not satisfied with the sanitary con
ditions of many of the restaurants of
the city and they announce their in
tention of appealing to the Supervis
ors and Board of Health to have the
places properly cleaned and ventilat
ed. The waiters say that their health
is endangered while they work in un
sanitary kitchens and dining-rooms.
The long existing dispute between
the Steamfltters' and the Machinists'
unions was settled in favor of the for
mer body by the Building Trades
Council last night. A committee com
posed of W. W. Freelam, W. Best and
J. J. Corbett was appointed to inves
tigate another dispute between the
same unions.
The council unanimously tendered a
vote of thanks to the representatives
of that body for the good work thsy
did in the cause of labor at the session
of the State Legislature. The follow
ing resolutions condemning the emi
gration of Japanese into this country
were adopted:
I Resolved. That the Building Trades Council
of San Francisco Invite thÂ« San Francisco L*

BUSINESS MEN
ARE CENSORED
Pacific Commercial Museum
Issues Pamphlet Regard
ing the Philippine Trade
In a pamphlet just issued by the
Pacific Commercial Museum in this city,
business men are confronted with a
statement that the trade of the Philip
pines, notwithstanding that the coun
try is under the American flag, ia going
more largely to England and the con
tinental countries of Europe than to
the United States, and will so go so
long as "no attempt is made by Ameri
cans to introduce their products."
"If an answer is needed," so sets
forth the Pacific Commercial Museum's
publication, "it is because the neces
sary effort to get the trade has not
been made, indifference to opportuni
ties nivpented and the erroneous as
sumption that because the islands were
I'niKd States possessions the business
would be thrown at us."
The pamphlet may cause consider
able comment and such Is its evident
purpose, as it continues in part as
follows:
It must be borne In mind that the principal
merchants ot the Philippines are old estab
lished concern*, carrying on their business
without regard to sentiment, but keenly alive
tor the situation, willing and eager to buy
Anterti-an goods if properly presented to them,
but Just as u-llllng to continue their relations
with Europe and England, no loÂ«g as no at
tempt is made by Americans to introduce their
product?. ,
The trade Is certainly ours for the asking â
thÂ«-n why not ask for It? It will not corns to
ub unsolicited.
Why not make an effort to turn the tide of
the ' Philippine * trail* from Europe to : thÂ«
United States, where It naturally belongs?
Purchase of all requirements, by the. Philip
pine Government are made, as far as is pos
Â»ilile. from merchants . located â In . the " Islands,
and many ' opportunities * are thereby lost to
our manufacturers unless they actually seek
the trade. '.â â â â 'â¢-â¢'- ; - - ' : ; *.: 'â "â â ' â .-_'"
These statements are followed up
with a statistical showing in which the
business transactions of the United
States and of other countries in the
United Philippines are summed up by
leading commodities and by amounts.
At thp close is an invitation to look
over the list and to write to the Pacific
Commercial Museum ir the reader is
not getting a fair share of the Philip
pine trade. The museum promises to
do what it can to increase the trade.
A matter has been brought to the
attention of the Commercial Museum
through a consular report which sets
forth that Americans are packing
goods for the Orient without due care
to foster the trade that may be created,
and instances a shipment of goods from
San Francisco to China, on the author
ity of an American missionary. C. E.
Boufifirld, head of the Baptist Mission

MAKRY IX ST. LOUIS
Miss Kitty Nelson of Los

of a Man From Louisiana
Special Dispatch to The call
ST. LOUIS. March 9.â lt became
known to-day that Miss Kitty Wsems
Nelson of Los Angeles and George L.
Cuendet were marrlH on Tuesday
night in St. Louis. It was the climax
of a romance which begun here, was
Interrupted by a long separation and
then resumed only by the happy acci
dent of a chance meeting this week on
a. St. Louis street, each visiting the city
unknown to the other.
Cuendet, who is the manager of a
: large ice plant in Shreveport. La., was
rearer? in St. Louis. Miss Nelson also
spent the early part of her life here.
Th<=> two were schoolmates together
and at the Blow School in St. Louis
began their romance. After their
sohool days there came a period of six
yrars during which time they saw
nothing of each other. Miss Nelson's
mother moved to Los Angeles, where
nhe has since lived, and yo-ung Cuendet
w;ent to Shreveport. A chance meeting
resulted quickly in a renewal of the
old ties and the couple decided to wed
immediately.
The knot was tied at the Lafayette
Park Methodist Church by the pastor.
Rev. Dr. Palmer. Then the couple went
to the PlanterÃ Hotel and the bride
wrote her mother a long letter inform
! ing her of her marriage and the inten
r tion of the couple to make a bridal
' journey to Lob Angeles to see her.
The mother of the bride first mar
j ried a nephew of Senator Fair, but
. was toon left a widow. She married a
; second time.

MEASURE TO STOP PRIZEFIGHTING MEETS DEFEAT
BOXING GAINS
LEASE OF LIFE
Bill to Prevent the Game
is Defeated in Assembly
After I HÂ»i Battle
EIGHT VOTES LACKING
Fact That Supervisors Take
No Steps to Stop It Here
Proves Strong Argument
SACRAMENTO, March Â».â Antrim
wen; to the center of the ring promptly
this morning when time was called on
the anti-prizefight bill and put up a
stiff fight, but the opposition had a
brick in its right glove and the advo
cates of the measure went down and
out in the first round of the contest.
The referee's tab showed 33 ooints
for the bill and 25 against it. Forty
one votes were required for it to be
come a law.
The fact that San Francisco's Board
of Supervisors takes no steps to stop
prize-righting In that city, though hav
ing the power to do so, was brought
out strongly during the debate ana was
used by the opponents or the Mil as an
argument why the Legislature should
not interfere.
L nder th^ rule that debate lÂ» limited
to nv< minutes on each side, there was
:nu( h oratory, bui moet at that
delivered was of a strong ord
Amerige delivered a straightforward
address: "There is rot a member on
this floor," he said, "who is not thor
oughly familiar with this hill, it is in
troduced to purify a branch of athletic
eport. There is little use calling at
tention to the morality of it. That is
well understood. It is in the interest
of purity and decency and has the in
dorseement of the Olympic Club ana
the Southern California Athletic Club.
It Is intended to elevate mankind in
stead of degrading "it. It is aimed at
â¢the iniquitous trust that controls prize
fighting in San Francisco and which is
passing beyond the bounds of decency.
There is no one in -this Assembly who
would not vote to pass a law against
bullfighting and bullfighting is more
humane than some of the prize fights.
They have laws in the East similar to
this one. California is ten years be
hind the times in this respect."
FI,<HM> OI ORATORY.
"Would you make the people go back
to ancient um^s, when they killed peo
ple with swords or pistols or axes?"
asked Lv
"Better that than to put men into the
ring and debauch our youth," replied
Amerig- .
"The allÂ»g<--d amateur fights this bill
would foster work more damage to the
- men than do the professional
BtB," said Mitoheltn-e. "Aleck
â¢Ireggains. who conducts one of these
amateur clubs in San Francisco, urged
me to work for the passage of this bill,
saying he could make more money out
of amaieur fights than out of the pro
al ones."
"1 i â¢ ver saw a prize fight and hope
1 neve/ shall gee one." said Cleveland.
"I introduced an amendment to this
biil yesterday that would do away with
all fights. If this business is as bad as
they ,Â«ay it is we should stop it entirely.
These people who are here trying to
pass this bill want prize fighting of
some kind to exist."'
"It Is not my purpose to argue
whether prize fighting is right or
wrong," said McGowan, "but I make
this statement to you: This is a gen
eral bill, but it is aimed at a local in
dustryâone that exists in San Fran
cisco. We have a legislative body of
our own there â a Board of Supervisors
âand Just as long as those Supervisors
favor It, it is the duty of the legislative
representatives of that city to defend
it. While it is true I havej>een an in
frequent visitor to these e^bitions. on
the few occasions I have attended them
I have seen some of the most promi
nent men of all parts of the State pres
ent."

English Boxer Is Expected
on Oceanic With Bowker,

SPORTS DISAPPOINTED
New Yorkers Are Heady
to Greet the Europeans
in a Hearty Manner
Special DtapatCh to The Call.
NEW YORK. March S.â Jabez White,
the English lightweight champion box
pr. and Jem Bowker, bantam-weight
champion of the world, who were ex
1 to arrive in this country on the
steamship Oceanic, which reached here
to-day, were not passengers on the
liner.
A large crowd of sporting men were
on the pier to meet the English fight
ers. After waiting until the last pass
enger left th<> ship and as neither Bow
ker nor AYhite showed up they walked
away disappointed.
White iss supposed to meet Britt some
time in Anril, while Bowker will be
rematched to fight Frankie Xeil for the
bantam-weight championship of the
world. It is expected the English
fighters will arrive here within a week
or ten days.
MANAGERIAL ABILITY OF
CIRCUS PEOPLE IS GREAT
Peculiar Manner in which Menagerie
BesMÃe Enlarged and Troubles
of Keeping Bea.Â«Â»t.s Alive.
The amount of money and man
agerial ability necessary for the con
trolling of a large circus, suih as Xor
ris & Rowe are now showing nightly
to crowded houses at the Mechanics'
Pavilion, is an unknown art to the
average layman.
Last year when the circus was in
New York Manager H. S. Rowe was
confronted with the immediate neces
sity of replenishing his menagerie.
Through adverse climntic conditions
a great many of the wild animals
died. Rowe at once cabled his agents
in Europe to buy up all the wild
beasts in sight. In a short time a
i onsignment of elephants, monkeys,
lions, tigers and catamounts arrived
by steamer. In the meantime more
animals were obtained from South
America. The agents in Kurope were
cabled to stop buying. The order ar
rived too late, for another load of an
imals had Just been shipped.
When the jungle tribe reached New
York it was found necessary to en
large the menagerie, so that is why
Norris & Rowe are at a great expense
showing the largest aggregation of
undomesticated animals in the United
.States.
Great trouble is experienced in
maintaining the health of the animals.
Many are constantly dying from sick
ness due to chatige of climate, while
others are killed in bloody fights with
their case mates.
The last days of the circus are ap
proaching. Over 60,000 people have
thus far attended. The show ends
Sunday night.
BOORAEM'S ARREST PROVES
TO HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE
Mining Engineer Who Was on His
Way to Goldfleld Is Discharged
by .Fudge Cabaniss.
Robert Booraem, mining engineer
from New York, who was arrested at
the St. Francie Hotel on Wednesday
afternoon on a dispatch from Santa
Barbara, applied to Police Judge Ca
baniss yesterday to be released on
bail. He explained to the Judge that
he had been a guest for a few days at
the Hotel Potter, Santa Barbara, with
a friend. He produced a letter of
credit for $500 on the First National
Bank of Los Angeles and said he had
given the hotel clerk a check, as he
thought, on that bank, but it had been
on the wrong bank through a mistake
of the clerk's.
Booraem's friend was in court and
showed the Judge a letter of credit
for $4000. He assured the Judge that
Booraem's statement was true. The
Judge said he would fix the bail at
$200 cash and Booraem's friend
promptly put up the amount. Just at
that moment Detective Bunner, who
made the arrest, came hurriedly into
court and showed the Judge a tele
gram received from Santa Barbara by
Acting Chief Spillane, which read:
"Don't arrest Booraem. Had funds."
The Judge promptly discharged
Booraem in open court. Booraem
threatened to bring a suit for dam
ages against the proprietor of the Ho
tel Potter for malicious arrest. He
is on his way to Goldfleld, Nev.

yesterday at Oakland track. The Texas
half-breed defeated the gray, but did
not win the race. Ridden by Graham
he made all the running and looked
like the money until the paddock was
reached. Here Graham let Knapp,
astride Nigrette, through on the rail.,
and the black mare from the Jennings
stable won by a length in 1:13. E. M.
Brattain tired perceptibly, losing the
show to Romaine.
Favorites decamped with three
purses. The winners all received back
ing, however, and the bookmakers laid
away nothing.
CHIEF WITTMAN SCORES.
Chief Wittman, with W. Davis up,
captured the 2-year-old half-mile dash.
The big chestnut colt closed a 7 to 3
favorite, and had his hands full to
overtake and beat Lorena M a head.
Fifteen to 1 could be had on the latter.
Ramona disposed of the tardy Iron
Watson for show honors.
As Lloyd Fountain is no star and
had the mount on Dora I, the mare's
admirers were enabled to obtain a pro
fusion of 9 to 5 in the betting on the
six and a half furlong run. She was
fortunate to get through on the rail
and in a hard drive downed Olympian
a neck. Royal White ran third at 13
to 1.
Sacredus took the six-furlong purse
run for Walter Jennings. Royal
Rogue, played down to 9 to 10 favorit
ism, led at the paddock and looked all
over a winner, when Knapp brought
Sacredus up with a rush, getting the
decision bj' a neck. Eddie Walsh rode
a vigorous finish on the 16 to 1 outsid
er, Billy Taylor, finishing a close third.
XORTH WEST AN EASY WINNER.
With Hugh McGowan safely en
sconced in his stall. North West
looked all over a winner for the mile
and twenty yard selling run. The
price against the Figaro stable's mare
dropped from 6 to 5 to 4 to 5 and she
ran away from her field. Lady Kent,
a 25 to 1 shot, ran second, less than
a length ahead of Isabella.
By his showing in the concluding
mile run Rockaway demonstrated that
distance of any sort is not his forte.
The Jennings horse had Treubel in
the saddle and went to the post fa
vorite over Toledo. He was permitted
to map out his own pace and then
Toledo lowered his colors at the fin
ish, hand ridden only. Gateway fin
ished third.
TRACK NOTES.
The whereabouts of Solomon Bon
ner, the colored rider, remain a dark
secret. Memphis, though, is said to
be his destination.
W. Davis came out after an extend
ed vacation and rode an excellent race
on Chief Wittman, winner of the two
year-old scramble. Davis is only a
boy and his previous displays of tem
per and other failings were overlooked,
the crowd griving him a warm wel
come. Davis means to act like a gen
tleman, but now and then he forgets.
A little age will curb this fault and he
can rest assured the California public
forgives him.
Ed Corrigan is figuring on winning
the Kentucky Derby with Drexel. Tod
Sloan will be the pilot.
Royal Rogue is "a bleeder" and
Birkenruth was probably afraid to
hustle the chestnut too much.
"Big Bill" Knapp rode two winners.
Hifi handling of Nigrette was a nice
piece of horsemanship, and now in all
likelihood the Jennings stable rider'
has broken the hoodoo.
Harry Stover will send Kenilworth,
Gforge P. McNear and Abe Meyer to
the New York tracks this season, it is
said.
Harold Ford, the well-known pad
dock commissioner, is reducing for the
coming baseball season. High balls
will be tabooed for low balls.
The two-year-olds from the Napa
Stock Farm in the New York string
of Newton Bennington have been
christened as follows: Voorhes, b. c.
by Solitaire 11-Carnation II; Belasco,
b. c. by Solitaire 11-Headfiower;
Black Gem. br. or blk. c. by Solitaire
11-Break o' Day; Cinna, eh. c. by Mar
ius 11-Elmlnette; Marius Calus, eh. c.
by Marius 11-Florence B.
Bookmaker Joe Rose is something
of a spceulator when the spell strikes
him. Up to the fifth race Joe found
himself $6500 in the hole. He bet $700
en Nigrette and held her out in his
book. Then favoring and getting down
on Toledo to win the last, he quit win
ner on the day.
PRACTICE WORK DRAWS
NEAR TO ITS CLOSE
Fire Laddies and Coppers Putting Fin-
ishing Touches on Their Con
dition Stunts.
Only two days remain before the
firemen and the policemen will hook
up for their annual chairlty ball game
at Recreation Park and the rival toss
ers are putting in their best licks to
be In form when Umpire Jack O'Con
nell calls time. The practice work
will draw to a close to-morrow, when
both teams will do some lively work.
Michael Joseph Conboy says he will
make the firemen rooters look like
stage money when he starts with his
brigade. Conboy has been appointed
official yell leader for the coppers, and
the firemen are hard at work collect
ing a bunch of bells with which to
drown the music of the whistles in
possession of Conboy and his follow
ers.
Dark Outlook for Missouri Racing.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.. March 9.
The House bill providing for the re
peal of the breeders' law was passed
in the Senate to-day by a vote of 18
to 13. The breeders' law was enact
ed in 1897 and provided that betting
on horseracing should take place only
within the confines of the racetracks.
The repeal ot this bill eliminates all
prohibition on racing letting in Mis
souri.
The passage of the measure marka
a distinct step in the effort being made
to eliminate race bettinsr in Missouri,
as it was necessary to repeal the
breeders' law to pave the way for the
House bill prohibiting bookmaking
and gambling on races in Missouri,
which measure will probably be taken
up to-morrow.

STEWARDS MAY CHANGE DATES.
Western Jockey Club Officials Have
Some Problems to Solve.
CHICAGO, March 9. â It was an
nounced to-day that the Western
Jockey Club stewards will hold an
important meeting to reconsider
racing dates. It is said this reconsid
eration involves only Little Rock,
Oaklawn, New Orleans and possibly
Memphis tracks.
The meeting will probably be held
on Monday. The real problem for
consideration is the situation at New
Orleans, where the Crescent City track
has put on eight races a day in or
der to "do things" to the City Park
track. Should dates for this track be
extended, as many think will be the
case, it will Interfere with Memphis
track, which still claims to be loyal to
the Condon-Cella interests, which
means the Western Jockey Club. It
is thought there will be no opposition
to allotting the Little Rock dates to
the Hot Springs track.
MAYOR GIVES UP IDEA
OF SUSPENDING BAEHR
Will Have a Taxpayer Bring Suit
to Prevent Payment of Grand
Jury Expenses.
Mayor Schmltz has finally decided
not to carry out his threat to sus
pend Auditor Baehr for auditing de
mands for Grand Jury expenses in ex
cess of the legal allowance made for
the purpose. The Mayor believes that
better results will be obtained by hav
ing a Supreme Court decision on the
point as to whether the Grand Jury
can incur unlimited expenditures in
the discharge of its duties. Especially
does the Mayor want a judicial deter
mination of the right of the inquisi
torial body to rent outside quarters
and buy additional furniture when
rooms and furniture have been pro
vided at the City Hall for the pur
pose.
The Mayor has not as yet outlined
any mode of procedure in the matter,
but It is quite likely that he will
have some taxpayer bring suit
against the Auditor to restrain him
from paying the next batch of de
mands for Grand Jury expenses. This
would throw the dispute in the
courts. Baehr audited demands for
February aggregating some $700 for
various expenditures for the Grand
Jury, but payment of the March bills
will be contested.
Irish Chorus Rehearsals.
Professor John W. McKenzie is re
hearsing the St. Patrick's day chorus
at his office in the Supreme Court
building, 305 Larkin street. He an
nounces that many singers have vol
unteered their services for the occa
sion. There will be rehearsals next
Saturday, Sunday and Monday even
ings at 8 o'clock.
PRISONERS PLEAD GUILTY.â Irene Cook.
a youns girl charged with gTand larceny, was
allowed to plead guilty to petty larceny in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday. It is likely
that sentence on her will be suspended. F
C. Jatser. 1231 Mission street, accused her
or stealing $S>4 from him on January 28 but In
court yesterday he said that he thought he
lost the money. Edward Parker pleaded guilty
In Judge Dunne's court to a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon and will be sentenced
on Monday. He cut Henry Crittenden of Oak
land with a knife in a saloon at 11 East street
on December 30.

WOMEN DEDICATE
NEW GYMNASIUM
William Greer Harrison's
Eemarks Contain a Lot
of Good Athletic Sense
Last evening was a memorable one
at the Jefferson Square Club building.
The San Francisco Women's Athletic
Association headquarters were formal
ly dedicated with pomp and ceremony
befitting the occasion. A full house
prevailed long before William Greer
Harrison, president of the Olympic
Club and star of the occasion, rose
to give the ladies advice on how to be
come strong as well as beautiful.
Mr. Harrison was greeted with ap
plause and throughout the twenty min
utes of his discourse every one in the
house was all attention, eager to catch
every word uttered, by the well-known
athletic authority. He passed out
some good solid advice â the kind that
will count if the ladles will follow it
out.
"This club is already a success," gald
Mr. Harrison in the course of his re
marks. "You have started out right,
you have adopted the right principles
and now the thing to do is to keep go
ing ahead and some day soon I hope
to see a number of star women per
formers in action at one of our Olym
pic Club entertainments.
"One of the first things women ath
letes will have to do is to leave their
pride behind them In the dressing
room. From what experience I have
had with women athletes I find the
principal thing that troubles them \4
their latest costume. Now none of you
should worry about how you look in
your gym suit. It's the work that con
cerns you, not the dress and each and
every one of you will have to labor fÂ©r
results.
"You should all consult your doctor
before you begin to take exercise. The
president of this club will be glad to
give you advice and I take great
pleasure in recommending you to her.
Every woman can gain grace and
beauty through athletics and I say it
is a shame for any woman to be home
ly when she- can attain beauty by this
simple, healthful remedy.
"This will be a true athletic club in
every sense of the word and I feel
gratified to know there will be no vul
gar prizefighting held here and even
more so for the fact that there will be
no fake amateur club business. This
club is to be a true athletic organiza
tion and you must not let the social
bee buzz too strongly in your bonnets.
If you do the club will be a failure."

CASCADE ARRIVE ON QUEEN
STRANDED STEAM SCHOONER PULLED OFF ROCKS
I' th<* wiMll of the steam schooner

carefully rehearsed It could not have
been managed with any more consid
eration for the feelings and comfort
of the passengers. When the boat
Ftruck those who had paid for the
privilege of riding: to San Francisco
on her experienced the real thrill of a
sure-enough shipwreck. There was tht
cry of "breakers ahead," without
which no shipwreck is genuine. There
was a tiny little panic, contributed by
the five women who were among in.'
score or more of passengers. The of
ficer* of the steamer poured the oil of
calm assurance on the rising sea of
hysterics and all on board settled
down to enjoy the wreck. -
The Cascade's decks were not even
Bplashed. There, was just the surges
tion of a list to starboard which de
tracted nothing from the comfort of
the shipwrecked and added a realistic
touch to thÂ« situation.
Before the sensation became mo
ncionous the steamship Queen came
along and stopped a few hundred yards
ayÂ« ay. A lifeboat, " manned by hardy
Norsemen and captained by a tall,
handsome purser, resplendent In the
blue and gold of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company uniform, left the
Qu^en and soon was alongside the Cas
es d*. A short conversation between
Captain Johnson and the Queen's pur
ser, who had taken Captain Alexan
der's compliments and wanted to know
â what he could do to alleviate the Cas
cade's distress, and the passengers
wete told to take their clothes and go.
With their trunks and grips they
were transferred to the Queen, which
â landed them all here yesterday after
noon, safe and sound and with a real
ehip wreck experience to furnish topic
for conversation for the remainder of
their lives.
The Cascade, bound to this port
from San Pedro, went ashore at mid
>night on Tuesday/twelve miles north
of Point Duma. She lost her bearings,
It is claimed, during a heavy fog. She
had on board twenty-two passengers,
who \\ ere taken off by the Queen early
Wednesday afternoon.
The Cascade was towed off yesterday
by the tug His and taken to San
Pedro, where she will probably be re
paired.
The Cascade's passengers who ar
rived here yesterday on the Queen
were:
J. J. MeCully and wife, F. A. Patterson
ar wife. Mrs. M. Hughes. W. E. Scott. War
ren Matthews. Flora L. McCo-wan, C. H. Har
riton. Albert Myers. Mrs. R. F. Beam, Peter

FVert Johannsen. E. Ellswell and brother. G.
W. Foster. F. MrKinn<-y F. W. Smith. F L.
O'Hara. J. Nolan and James Gllison.
They had suffered no Inconvenience,
they said, and as the Queen landed
th?m here sooner than they could have
arrived on the Cascade If all had gone
( well with that boat, they brought with
them no grievance of any kind.
"There was Just one little splash."
said me of the women, "as we were
leaving the Cascade. A warVe hit the
steamer'*:. side and curled over into the
boat. Hardly enough to wet us.
though. I've been to plenty of picnics
â¢wherp the hardships were greater
than in our shipwreck."

RAILWAYS' PACT
WITH OIL TRUST
Alleged Agreement for the
Crush ing: Out of Competi
tion in the Kansas Field
TOPEKA, Kans., March 9.â lnÂ« the
hearing erf the rebate suit against the
Santa Fe, former Attorney General
Monett of Ohio introduced a letter
purporting to have come from a for
mer employe of the Standard Oil Com
pany of JopHn, Mo. The missive al
leges that upon the completion of the
Standard Oil Company's pipe lines an
agreement was entered into between
the Standard and the Santa Fe, the
Missouri Pacific, the Missouri, Kansas
and Texas Railway, and possibly oth
ers, whereby the tariff for the trans
portation of oil over these railway lines
should be placed at an exorbitant and
prohibitive figure. The railways were
to profit from this transaction through
distribution among the railways of 10
cents on every barrel of oil run through
the Standard's pipe line.
This made It Impossible for the inde
pendent companies to ship oil and had
the effect of eliminating: competition
to the Standard OH Company. The
theory is that the Standard made the
producer stand this expense by reduc
ing the price of crude petroleum a cor
responding amount.

fice of chief engineer is $250 a mon,th.

COURT ASKED
FOR OPINION
Colorado Legislators Seek
a Way Out of the Tangle
Over the Governorship
DENVER, March 9. â The joint leg
islative convention has sought an
opinion from the State Supreme Court
on the question whether it has the
power to declare the office of Gover
nor vacant and what the effect of such
action would be and the decision of
the Peabody-Adams gubernatorial con
test will be deferred until the court's
answer is received.
Senator Morton Alexander, a mem
ber of the contest committee, was al
lowed this afternoon to amend his re
port, which favored the seating of
Lieutenant Governor Jesse A. McDon
ald as Governor, in such a way that,
if it be now adopted by the joint con
vention, Governor Adams will be leg
islated out of office.
Alexander's amended report de
clares that there was no legal election
for the office of Governor in this State
last November, but the resolution de
claring Lieutenant Governor McDon
ald "the legal duly qualified Governor
of the State" is omitted and the fol
lowing is substituted:
Resolved, That the action of the Joint As
sembly In declaring Alva Ailams elected Gov
ernor be hereby rescinded and revoked and
that a vacancy be declared in the office of
Governor.
Under the constitution the ariop- >
tion of the Alexander resolution would t
seem to have the effect of continuinK
former Governor James H. Peabody
in office, his legal successor not having
been elected. That Question, however,
will be submitted to the Supreme
Court for adjudication before a vote
is taken on any of the reports now be- !
tore the joint Assembly.
In the meantime the allegations of
Senator Richard W. Morgan in regard
to bribery will probably be held in j
abeyance.

STRATTON TAKES
THE DIAMONDS
Booty of Absconding Agent
Louis Hospital Seized by;
the Collector of Customs
SEVEN HUNDRED GEMS
Point Raised That Stones
Were Not Imported by
Owners, but by a Thief
Acting upon information conveyed to
him, Customs Collector Stratton has de
manded and received from Paco Van
queur 709 diamonds which had been
surrendered to Vanqueur by Louis
Hospital, thÂ« absconding agent of
Spetten A Co. of Paris. As has !
been already published. Hospital was
followed from Havana to this city by
Vanqueur, who procured the abscond- ,
ers arrest a few days ago. Hospital
turr.â¬d over to Vanqueur the remain- ,
ing diamonds in his possession and was
released from custody, Vanqueur hay- ;
ing refused to make complaint against
him for embesslement.
Collector Stratton yesterday instruct
ed United States District Attorney
Woodworth to begin suit for condem
nation and forfeiture of the diamonds
as smuggled goods. Their value was
given to Collector Stratton as a little
more than $11,000. but there is certainly
a mistake about this, for se\'eral of
the diamonds weigh more than one
karat each. The total value given
would be an average of only $15. Mr.
Stretton. before pressing the suit for
forfeiture, will await instructions from
Washington as to whether the forfeit
ure may not be set aside upon pay
ment of the* duty of ten per cent of the
value. It has been represented that
the diamonds were not smuggled into
this country by the owners or with
their consent, but that they were
stolen by Hospital after he reached
Havana. Pending a reply from Wash
ingtun no appraisement of their value
will be made.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 10. 1905.
DENOMINATIONS
ARE CONSIDERED
Clergy Join in Discussion
of Greek, Roman Catholic
and Protestant Churches
UNITY OF CHRISTENDOM
Mrs. 3leserve Gives Graphic
Description of a Good
Friday Service Abroad
"The Unity of Christendom ' was the
subject of a long and scholarly discus
sion before the San Francisco Associa
tion of Congregational Churches and
Ministers yesterday at Plymouth Con
gregational Church, Post street, near
Webster. The Rev. E. L. Walz was
moderator. The Rev. Sebastian Dabo
vich, priest of the Russo-Greek
Church, was present
The Rev. George C. Adams, D. D.,
took for his argument "The Orthodox
Greek Church and the Unity of Chris
tendom," wherein he traced the church
In all its 3tages, showing where it had
lost its power, while the Roman Catho
lic Church maintained its authority.
The Roman Catholic church, he said,
had kept from schisms. The Greek
church could not succeed in holding
what it had conquered. There were
200,000,000 Roman Catholics, he said,
150,U00,000 Protestants and 90,000,000 of
the Greek church, so, as a matter of
lact, the last named was not as strong
as its name would imply.
Mrs. Cora D. Meserve, in giving a
descriptive account of "An Easter in a
Greek Church in London," told of the
procession on Good Friday. In it came
the priest with swinging, fra
grant censer, the bishop with
his rich vestments and chanting
voice, singing boys and priests,
each bearing a lighted candle.
And in the midst of all was borne the
bier with its pathetic figure of the
blessed Savior of mankind, covered
with the grand canopy and carried by
the appointed priests in the funeral
march.
ihe Roman Catholic Church and
the Unity of Christendom" was the
subject allotted to the Rev. William
Rader, who said that the first thing in
Roman Catholicism which had made
for unity was an orthodox faith in the
fundamentals of theology. The Roman
Catholic church, he said, had never wa
vered in its faith in the divine nature
of Christ.
"The Protestant Church and the
Unity of Christendom" was treated by
the Rev. I. C. Meserve, D. D., who said
that all differences were softening up
and melting away and working toward
Christian unity. He said it was coming
in the Protestant world first
"Unity of Christendom By and In the
Spirit'" was taken up by the Rev. W.
H. Hopkins of Berkeley, who was of
opinion that it was not feasible that
there could be unity of form, while he
upheld unity in the spirit. He consid
ered that there had not been a day
within this generation when the church
could accomplish so much as now. The
differences, he thought, might be left to
care for themselves.
Among those who discussed the topic
were the Rev. Dr. Willey, Rev. Mr.
Earl, Rev. Mr. Scudder, Rev. W. H.
Atkinson, Henry Wall, B. A., and Rev.
H. A. Luckenbach. Mrs. Charles W.
O'Brien presided at the organ.

FREDERIC MISTRAL
AXD THE XOBEL PRIZE
Provencal Poet Will Devote His
Award to Develop His Museum
at Aries.
Frederic Mistral, the Provencal poet,
recently awarded 50,000f. by the
Swedish Academy as half share of the
Nobel Prize for Literature, now states
his intention of devoting this sum to
the development and adequate installa
tion of the little ethnological museumâ
Le Musee Arletanâ founded by him
some years ago at Aries. For this
purpose the municipal authorities agree
to make over an old palace, now used
as a college, the restoration and adap
tation of which will cost zOO.OOOf.
The matter haa engaged the interest
of an American resident of Avignon,
Edward Leon, Avho offers 50,000f. as a
subscription and undertakes to ar
range tor five lectures in the United
Statesâ New York, Philadelphia, Bal
timore and Boston being the suggested
citiesâ to help on the fund thus in
augurated. Mr. Leon is confident that
the remaining 150,U00f. will be easily
raised, for he writes: "In France you
have no idea of the prestige Mistral
enjoys with us. At the present time he
is the most popular of your writers."
The poet himself expresses the hope
that the restored building may by and
by become "the palace of the Felibrige,
the center for its meetings and popular
fetes." The Felibrige, it may be noted,
is an association of Provencal poets
who aim at keeping alive all that is
best in the 10-eal customs and feeling
by poems written and recited and by
dramatic presentation. It was founded
in 1854 by Mistral and six other writ
ers, whose religious and political sym
pathies wereâ as those of the "felibres"
still remainâ chiefly Roman Catholic
and legitimist. The Jubilee was feted
at Vaucluse on the feast of St. Estelle
last May, and the next annual com
memoration will take place at Avig
non on or about the same day. Mis
tral's work gives perhaps the fullest
and highest expression to the spirit
ruling the association, but his service
to literature includes, besides poems â
ot which "Mireille" has become widely
known by Gounod's opera of the name
âthe erudite Dictionnaire Franco-Pro
vencal. The old poet writes from his
native town in the Department
Bouches-du-Rhone, and here he ia
proud to be known to his fellow poets
as "notre pere de Maillane."â London
Times.
SEA-GAZING GKKAT
SPORT IN BERMUDA
Wonderful Life of Crystal Depths
as Revealed to the
Observer.
It was a little parrot fish who started
out so briskly on this summer morning.
Whether he was eager to keep an ap
pointment or had been unexpectedly
summoned to a distant part of the
world one will never know, but one
may be certain that the matter was of
the greatest consequence so far as the
little fish was concerned. Keeping his
bright eyes fixed straight ahead, he
passed a corner of the reef where the
coral was incrusted with mollusks and
sea-urchins and where a pair of beau
tiful squirrel fish, deeply engrossed in
sentimental affairs, turned to look after
him wonderingly through their enor
mous eyes. Below, in a deep pool, a
school of spotted trunkflsh played heed
lessly, while under a projecting plate
of staghorn coral a huge grouper wait
ed expectantly, but as the parrot-fish,
warned of his danger, turned quickly
away, he gave his attention to a pair
of gray snappers â great, quiet, ghost
ly figures that seemed like two shad
ows drifting Blowly along, far down
through the green waters.
A few feet farther on and the hurry-
Ing parrot-fish passed a tall Bea-fan
around which three dainty butterfly
fish, clad brilliantly in yellow, were
peering into each nook and corner In
their search for small prey, while a
sober cowfish, with his two conspicu
ous horns, looked on sedately. Sud
denly the parrot-fish turned sharply
aside to avoid a spot where the reef
was broken by Jutting rocks covered
with green ulva; around this a school
of bright little zebra-striped sergeant
majors were sporting, while just to the
right an angel fish, whose blue body
tipped with gold first attracted the at
tention of the mariners so many cen
turies ago, sailed from under a purple
gorgonia with a disdainful air. â Metro

962 PEOPLE KILLED
ON NEW YORK ROADS
Report of Railroad Commission for
1904 Shows Also 2399 Persona
Injured.
Increased operating expenses chiefly
cause a falling off in net earnings for
the year ending June 30. 1904, covered
by the annual report of the State
Railroad Commission, recently issued.
Net earnings for 190| were less by
$311,471 than in 1903. Expenses of oper
ation were $240,186,437; in 1903 they
were $226,991,079. The report ascribes
the increase principally to the rise
in wages, greater cost of fuel for loco
motives and the unusually severe win
ter of 1903-1904.
The total number of persons killed
was 952; injured, 2399. In 1903 884 were
killed and 1726 injured. The report as- [
cribes the increase in casualties to the
greater number of trains operated, for
improvements in roadbeds and equip
ment, which should have diminished
the number of accidents, have been
many. Only twelve of those killed and
446 of those injured in 1904 were passen
gers. The average for the past five
years is eighteen passengers killed and
349 injured.
Regarding street surface roads the
board reports the cost of their road and
equipment for the year at $470,668,920,
a gain of $16,000,000 over 1903. Net
earnings from operation were $20,
567,122 in 1904 and $20,715,127 in 1903.
These roads still have In their equip
ment 4443 horses, but the number
shows a decrease of over 600 since 1903.
In the year 193 persons were killed on
street surface roads and 878 injured.
The report says that while improve- j
ments of these roads have continued,
especially on suburban and interurban
lines, a few of the older and less Im
portant roads are not in proper condi- j
tion. One of the most serious defects ,
exists in the method of train dispatch- 1
ing. A uniform method must be adopt- I
ed to insure safety of operation. â New
York Commercial.
Largest Masonry Arch.
The builders are at work on a stone
viaduct at Plauen, Saxony, over the
river Syra, which contains the longest
masonry arch in the world, Its length
being 295 feet 3 inches, measured
horizontally from base to base. The
Luxembourg bridge across the valley
of Petruffe, which was completed a few
months ago, has a span of 277 feet.
The next longest masonry arch is in the
United States, near Washington, and
is known as the Cabin John Bridge.
Its length of span is 220 feet.â New
York Tribune.

SOME GOOD EXAMPLES
OF THE BRITISH WIT
Quick Repartee Is L'sed as a Weapon
Both of Offense and
Defense.
"That is the retort courteous," said
the fool in the forest, when he qualirled
the quip and crank to the lie direct.
The man who can accomplish the re
tort courteous gives splendidly the lie
direct to many an awkward accusa
tion, and, if his wit be bitter, so much
the more deadly his point.
In the time of Charles II in England,
in an age of wits, the grand master of
the art of retort was the crippled first
Earl of Shaftesbury. 'Shaftesbury."
said the King to him one day, "I be
lieve that thou art the wickedest dog
in all my dominions.' "Of a subject,
sire, I believe I am," was the reply.
While speaking against the test bill in
the House of Lords the Earl overheard
an indolent churchman say, "I wonder
when he will have done preaching."
The orator whispered loud enough to
be heard by all. "When I am made a
bishop, my lord."
Dr. Garth, a witty physician of the
court of Queen Anne, had prescribed a
nauseous dose for the great warrior,
the Duke of Marlborough. When the
Duke objected to following the direc
tions the sharp tongued Duchess Sarah
broke in by saying, "I'll be hanged if it
does not cure you." "There, my lord,"
Interposed Garth, "you had better swal
low it; you will gain either way."
Repartee has ever flashed brilliantly
from the bench. Lord Mansfield, the
famous English Judge of the second
half of the eighteenth century, listened
to an argument of the insolently proud
Sir Fletcher Norton upon a case in
volving cer.tain manorial rights. "My
lord," said Norton, "I can instance the
point in person. Now, I have myself
two Jittle manors." "We are well aware
of that," said the Judge, smiling
kindly.
"Do you see anything ridiculous in
my wig?" said a judge to the famous
Irish barrister, John Curran. "Noth
ing but the head," flew back the re
tort.
The late Chief Justice Russell was
hearing a trial for bigamy. "What's
the extreme penalty ror bigamy?"
whispered a barrister. "Two mothers
in-law," said Russell.
Although the law seems to be especi
ally conducive to skill in fencing with
words, the church has supplied a large
quota of men who delighted in the
give-and-take of verbal warfare. The
venerable Dr. Thomas Fuller, author
of "The Worthies of England," how
ever, met his match once when he pro-
pounded the following question to a
certain Dr. Sparrowhawk: "Pray, what
is the difference between a sparrow
hawk and an owl?" "Why," came the
response, "there is a great difference.
An owl is fuller in the head, fuller In
the body and fuller all over."
The eloquent Baptist divine, Robert
Hall, had a caustic wit. A flippant
young woman having broken into his
reveries in allusion to his fiance, Miss
Steel, by saying, "Ah, sir, if we had
but polished steel here, we might se
cure some of your attention; but"
"Madam," he replied, "make yourself
quite easy; if you are not pcrlished
steel, you are at least polished brass."
"What are you going to do in life?"
asked Cardinal Manning of a pert
undergraduate at Oxford. "Oh, I'm
going to take holy orders," was the
airy response. "Take care you eet
them, my son," came from the prelate.
Home Tooke is credited with this
daring retort to George 111, who had
asked him whether he played cards:
"Your majesty, I cannot tell a king
from a' knave." â London Chronicle.
DEMAND JXDR LOOT
AMONG FASHIONABLES
How a Shrewd Old Junk Dealer Built
Up a Trade in Odds and
Ends.
"What an odd fascination the word
loot has for some people," said a
Tenth avenue junk dealer, whom
drink had converted from a school
teacher to the keeper of a queer little
shanty in which all sorts of odds and
ends may be bought or sold.
"When the rummage sale was a
fashionable device for raising money
for charity some of the swell folk
from up on the west side took to com
ing down here to search for odd bar
gains in this mass of cast-off stuff,
but the fad passed.
"Then an idea struck me, and when
a couple of young women came in
here on* day to look for old brasses,
when I didn't have a piece of brass
In the place. I told them if they
wouldn't give me away I would show
them some Fifth avenue loot tnat I
had bought from the gentleman burg
lar who gave Captain Lantry so much
trouble.
"They just jumped at the word 'loot'
and paid me well for some bric-abrac
that I had bought from a tenement
family that had seen better days.
"They must have passed the word
around, for ever since then I have had
a steady business with well-dressed
women, who come in and whisper
mysteriously, 'Have you got any loot?*
I tell you it keeps me busy collecting
stuff that I can pass off as having been
stolen from fashionable homes and in
venting tales to make it attractive."â
New York Press.
An Archbishop's Joke.
The Right Rev. Dr. Randall Thomas
Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury,
more than held his own as a raconteur
during his visit to Fernleigh Over, the
county seat of Bishop Potter. This is
one of his stories: "When I was a
young man I once made an impassion
ed appeal on behalf of a foreign mis
sionary to an audience composed of my
rural panlshioners. The following
week I was surprised on entering a
provision shop in the village to be
greeted with marked coolness by the
worthy dame who kept it. On asking
the reason of this strange treatment
the good woman produced a half
crowr. from a drawer, and, throwing it
down before my astonished eves.
Bnapped: 'I marked that half crown
and put it in the plate last Sunday,
and here It is back again in my shop.
I knowed well enough them niggers
would never get the money.' "âLon
don Leader.
Desertions and Their Cause.
Frequency of desertions from the
army and navy are readily traceable
to national characteristics â to the free
and easy democratic ways of independ
ent "young America," who is used to
come and go as he pleases and unused
to restraint, and is bred to change his
occupation and domicile at will and to
pull up stakes and move on whenever
the humor seizes him. The tempera
ment is not conductive to patient en
durance of the irksome restraints and
obligations of discipline. But the
American sailor or soldier has the com
pensating merits of his defects. He is
not a well -drilled automaton or a fixed
cog in the machine, but he is quick to
act and think for himself in an emer
gency. â Milwaukee Sentinel.
Touches Souths Heart.
President Roosevelt knows how to
get close to the South when he starts
out to do it; knows how to touch us
to the quick. A month ago he an
nounced his intention of appointing
young Stonewall Jackson Christian,
grandson of the great Confederate
general, to a cadetship at West Point,
saying that he would be gratified to
see the name of Stonewall Jackson on
the army rolls. And now he has,
without solicitation, appointed a son
of Jeb Stuart, the typical cavalier of
the Confederate army, as United
States Marshal for the Eastern Dis
trict of Virginia. â Charlottesville

MISCELLANY OF CURIOS
IX ALLIGATOR'S STOMACH
Ajax, the Great Snnrlan of Cincinnati
Zoo, Lately Dead, a Great
Collector.
Alax, the eighteen-foot alligator, and
longest specimen ever seen in this
part of the country, died at the Zoo
yesterday after an illness extending
over the past winter.
Alligators in Northern captivity
never eat anything during the winter,
but heretofore have managed to sur
vive the ordeal.
Alax began, early in the season, to
pine away, reducing himself to a pit
able state of flabby melancholy. His
vitaMty slowly waned, and although
about 200 years old. according to Su
perintendent Sol Stephan's chronology.
he was expected to pull through.
Death, however, released him from
his torpor.
After paying their respects to the
mammoth corpse, the keepers got very
busy with scalpels and after nailing
his salted hide up concluded to per
form an autopsy, which they did. The
developments were surprising. Ajax's
death was then easily accounted for.
It was discovered that during the time
when the animals sowed wild oats he
had been subjecting his gastric organs
to many extremes, as the following
list of articles was found within him:
One fishhook, three and a half inches
long, supposed to be the remnant of a
fish aaten in his native Florida bayou.
One meteor, weighing two and a half
ounces. How he managed to get this
remnant of a fallen star Mr. Stephan
cannot explain, except that perhaps
when it fell ablaze into the dark water,
AJax may have mistaken it for a gaudy
firefly and swallowed It before he had
time to reconsider.
Three teeth of an iron garden rake,
held together by the original back
brace of Iron.
Seventeen toothbrushes, presumed to
have been dropped accidentally Into
his inclosure when on exhibition at Or
lando, Fla_, and at the Zoo. AJax, it
appears, was fond of this diet.
Three pairs of spectacles, without
their lenses.
Three dollars and eighteen cents in
silver and pennies (last of his bank
account, according to Sol Stephan).
Nine rubber combs.
One door knob.
One pair of scissors.
One small iron bootjack.
Ajax had formerly been the prop
erty of an alligator dealer â a woman
â at Orlando, Fla., from whom he was
purchased two years ago by the gar
den management.
A handsome suit case will be cov
ered with the hide, when tanned, and
presented to President W. K. Schoepf
of the Cincinnati Traction Company.
â Cincinnati Enquirer.
Kind-Hearted Queen Ameile.
Once when driving Queen Ameile of
Portugal saw a large crowd surround
ing some one who had fallen down.
The footman was sent to ascertain
what was the cause of the accident,
and returning, reported that it was a
young girl who had fanted from weak
ness. The Queen left her carriage, ac
cording to the Indianapolis News, and
assisted the girl Into the privacy of a
nearby shop, and then personally at
tended to her professionally. The
Queen then made Inquiries about the
girl. She was a milliner, who, having
failed to get work at her trade, had
undertaken other employment for the
support of an Invalid mother, but with
such poor success that she was nearly
starved. The Queen is now her patron
ess, and she is at the head of one of
Lisbon's leading bonnet shops. â New
York Tribune.
Fifty Dollars for a Quart of Milk.
To provide milk for his 1 -year-old
son, George A. Bourgrois of Atlantic
City. N. J., one of the best known at
torneys In the State, to-day paid $200
for two quart bottles of milk and the
same amount of cream, or at the rate
of $50 a quart bottle, Mr. Bourgrois
lives in Ventnor, which waa completely
cut off from this city. On calling up
the milk depot the lawyer found that
It would be impossible to deliver
milk. He then hired Archie Burrell
to get the milk.
Snowdrifts ten feet high in places
blocked Burrell's horse and carriage.
At times he was obliged to drive to the
beach and his Journey, ordinarily three
miles, proved to be three times that
distance and occupied more than fou^
hours. But he reached the depot and
delivered the milk. Mr. Bourgols gave
Burrell a check for $200. â New York

yesterday paid :
COTTONâ The market ni oulet to-day, but
tnaint&ined a good continued undertone., with
â¢trocrer and higher Liverpool cables, con
tinued unsettled weather in the cotton belt
tending to delay further a season already more
than two week* late In preparing for the next
crop. The much improved prospects of early
Â«nd of Russo-Japanese war and the continu
ance of a rood demand for pot cotton and
only moderate offering from holders in the
Â£uth. furnish a combination of bullish features
calculated to put new life in the trading and
further strength in the position of staple.
The undertone was good up to the dose.
COFFEE â The early foreign advance* were
do: particularly favorable to the 1 market, but
were conEidered a fair response to our fluctua
tions of yesterday. On the whole, however.
Jobbers in the lower Wall street sections say
that there ie a better demand from Canada,
the West and the Southwest for actual coffee,
and the buyers do not haggle over the price,
but show a deposition to take the stuff at the
ctarket.

NEV\" YORK. March 8. â There was distinct
revive! of cpe^pulative enthusiasm in stocks
tb-6*f and a -rsole expansion in the
volume of the market was an accompaniment.
The moit effective factors upon sentiment
were the awakened strength in the group of
railroad etocks which have figured In the most
Industriously circulated of the rumors in re
rsxd to combinations and merger*. The en
tire QcieÂ«ceneÂ« of this croup ever since the
ernouncerneat of the Northern Securities de
cision has been a damper upon the speculative
spirit, as the plans concerning these properties
â¢Rtre suaposed to be waiting for that decision
to tie -promulgated. There was no authorita
tive news regarding the plans to-day, . but - thÂ»
demand for th*> stock* rescued . the . market
from sr-rre of the repressive 4nfluÂ«<nceÃ due to
I their lethargy. Yertarday's active speculative
'movement in Reading was also carried ove,r
Into to-day's dealings and that stock was run
up to within a charÂ« of- par. The only motive
assigned for the rise was a rumor that the
dividend rate would be advanced to 4 pÂ«r cent.
Beyond this It was alleged that the floating
' rupjfly of the rtoclc has been so- far | reduced
e.r to make It readily responsive to market op
eratlons a? hr â * bÂ»Â«^n demonstrated by the re
peated success of parties formed to operate. in
it trlthin the ".aÂ«* few months. The present
rrTretnent it ascribed to â â â¢ sanve sources.
ThTÂ» wa* â  very â¢â¢r'kinc movement also In
l rrotsp of th* ractal etocks, led by Smelting.
Arrsf.lgsnaV'd.Coppw was a ennsp-'ouous f.jrure
5r the h&tÂ»w group. Dividend rumors played
their part in i this movement also and , were
ruppitntefl with merger rumors affecting the
>s<J Industry. The spurt in Anaconda, Amal
gamated Copper's controlled stock, pointed to
OÂ» pource frcm which the parent stock Is to
btrn^fit by .rupposed dividend Increase. ReÂ»
r<orts from â â -â  copper trad^ were bright and

thâ¢j?h reports from that trade : continued
r.rilliar.t." Canadian Padfle wu supposed to
he benefited from large eernlnirs by Itself and
<tr controlled propertJes, all of which moved
up In company. . The special demand . for
>tchisoTÂ« in.th* loan crowd pointed to an out
sfanting Â«hf>rt Interest as the source of some
of the demand ' T H.
The fsvcrable groundwork to which, the
various operation* owed their rucpess had us
thÂ» r<r}npinaJ * Â»lrment the refinctlon in the
cfflelaV diKr<wnt rate of the Bank of England
from 3 to 2% per c*nt. a rate tower than has

a severe break in "prices occurred. May
dropped to $1 12% c. while July sold off â to
oo%c. ' On the i theory â¢ that the : new â  crop may
yet be 1 seriously damaged by frosts, , commis
sion â  houses turned active buyers, ' causing a
quick rally to 9-4% c - Short* : bought freely of
May, forcing the - price i of ' that â¢> option â  up" to
$1 14. For a time the price of May fluctuated
nervously, changes , of ..;â¢ %@%c being recorded
between trades. Late . in the day -â  the â¢; fear \of

Butter, Cheese and Kffjjs.
Butter was off again yesterday, with the
market quiet and weak, withvmore sellers than
buyers. Stocks, however, were not heavy and.
as already mentioned, the decline is -lue more
to the fear of what may happen than to any
thing that is actually occurring.
Cheese is also very weak, with most houses
shading the quotations to Mil, though sup
plies are not large. The situation resembles
thai in Butter.
Eggs, on the contrary, rule firm owing to
the liberal reductions in spot stocks for stor
age, and still another advance is noted. Both

low prices still ruled for the general run of
the choice and standard grades, which were
mostly Â»f poor quality. Strictly fancy offer
ings of sound fruit sold readily at the top
quotation and a premium was obtained for
small parcel* of favored brands. Four or five
cars will be auctioned to-day. Grape Fruit
an>l Mexican LimÂ°s were quoted steady, while
Tangerines and Lemons were dull. Tropical
fruits and Apples were unchanged and only
high-grade offerings of the latter were firm. A
half chest of Strawberries came In from Los
Angeles for aepeolal order and were billed out
at 15c per small basket.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. MARCH 10. 1905.
Young Emile McCartney, civil en
gineer and a favorite with the many
<>f his acquaintances, has surprised nr/t
a few of his intimate friends by his
sudden assumption of marital ties.
V\ hen Emiie McCartney hied him to
Berkeley, there to wed the fair Miss
Edith Knox, daughter of Harry A.
Knox 01 San Francisco, there were
none save the parties most concerned
that knew that the swain had been
voluntarily freed from a previous en
p-pg-oment to marry Miss Sasha Metro
polfcky.
Miss Metropolsky is the daughter of
a well known Russian priest, residing
at Â»48 Vallejo street, and \e one of the
most esteemed of the juvenile ele
ment of Russian society. It was at one
of the teas for which the Russians are
so famous that Emile McCartney first
met Miss Metropolsky. He became an
ardent wooer for the hand of the beau
tiful Russian maiden, and with the
laudable purpose of amassing a com
fortable income went to Nevada, and
returning last Christmas finally pre
sented Miss Metropolsky with the sen
erally cherished engagement ring, and
in accordance with Russian custom
he received from her a similar token,
or pledge of affection and loyalty.
Miss Metropolsky treats the matter
with calmness and had this to say
about the affair:
"Mr. McCartney had admitted to me
that he had become engaged to an
other girl, and of course the engage
ment, so far as I was concerned,
terminated there and then. That was
a week ago. He did not jilt me at all,
and I am deeply humiliated that this
affair should have been made public",
When spoken to about his daughter's
marriage to McCartney, Harry Knox
said:
"The young people have been ac
quainted between six and seven years.
that is they have been going together
for that time. They simply took a no
tion to go to Berkeley and get married.
Emile. I think, is of age: he is as tall
as I am, and I believe he is 22 or 23
years of age. As for the talk about
his mother taking steps toward an an
nulment of the marriage I can say
that such is not contemplated. I saw
Mrs. McCartney last night, havinc
called upon her at her request, and we
had a long talk, but nothing was said
or thought of an annulment. The
young folk are beneath my roof and
are very happy. Emile is a nice boy."

OPIUM POTION
CAUSES DEATH
E. C. Davis. Liquor Drummer,
Supposed to Have Killed
Himself Because of Worry
LETTER FROM HIS WIFE
Woman Longs to Have Hus
band With Her, Expressing
Oreat Affection for Him
Thar life of E. C. Davis, a liquor
drummer in the employ of Treadwell
& Co., terminated on the operating
room of the Central Emergency Hos
pital yesterday afternoon. Davis suc
cumbed to the effects of opium, and
every indication points to the fact that
it was self-administered.
No note was found on the person of
the dead man s that might show why
â¢he wanted to die. A uasslonate mis
sive, full of endearing terms and ex
pressions of love from a woman sign
ing herself "Your Loving Wife, Fay,"
was found in the pocket of the coat.
"Fay" calls Davis her husband and
longs to have him with her onct
again.
Davis staggered into a saloon at 131
O'Farrell street shortly after 2 o'clock
yesterday afternoon and sank into a
chair. He immediately collapsed and
the bartender, becoming alarmed, rang
in tor the Emergency Hospital ambu
lance. Every effort to revive Davis
was made by Dr. Millar, but he passed
away in a few minutes, as the poison
in his stomach was a large quantity
and the antidotes did not relieve him.
Davis had been separated from his
wife for some time, and it is believed
that the fact prayed on his mind. Both
parties had been trying for some time
to effect a reconciliation, but their ef
forts had not been entirely successful,
as the wife's letter indicates. Davis
was also said to have been In financial
straits for some time, and only a few
days ago a friend advanced him some
money to tide him over his difficulties.
Following is a copy of the letter writ
ten to Davis by his wife:
131 Beulah street. Thursday.
Sweetheart: You will yee I have more pa
per and I am writing to you again, yill send
the book from Honolulu Inlands to your sister
In the morning. I have it all wrapped and ad
dressed, so I think It will at last reach her
all right.
I Just hear you say, "Fay. I do love you with
all my heart. 1 But, Ed, If you are with me
or away from me. I know that you wlll-lovo
me and me alone as I love you.' Ed. do. you
know that you . and . I will be very happy?
I just know that we are and we will never
fight as so â¢ many do. will we? How can so
many get married when they do not. love each
ether, but for the sake, of money? .
Thank God that I did not do that, and I do
thank God that we love each other as we do.
O Ed. howl; would like to see you to-night!
0 Ed, will you always love me? And If some
times -I do act like a fool, remember, ; that
/lift In a little while I will be changed, be
cause'l am still young ana will be Just what
you want me to be. - - _.â  .
Sweetheart. I've got the blues to-night, and
I want you to love me and be loved. Ed. it
is rijtht that I should love you as I do. Yea,
it Is, and I am proud of It. Good night and
God bless you, my husband. I ki?s you and
wish you sweet dreams. With all my love, I
am. your loving wife. FAY.
P. S. â I wish to God you were still of the
same opinion.
PARADOXICAL VERDICT
BY CORONER'S JURY
Marcus Smith Charged With the Non-
Criminal Crime of Manslaughter
Committed in Self-Defense.
A Coroner's jury yesterday returned
a verdict charging Marcus Smith with
the impossible act of manslaughter in
self-defense. Smith killed Stewart
on March 5 by stabbing him in the
region of the heart. The evidence
tended to show that Smith had acted
in self-defense and therefore had not
committed either murder or man
slaughter. The verdict was* to the ef
fect that death had been caused by a
stab near the heart "received at the
hands of one Marcus Smith, and we,
the Jury, charge the said Marcus
Smith with voluntary manslaughter
committed In self-defense."
It is not likely that the novel doc
trine thus set up by the jury will ever
be incorporated into the law defining
murder and manslaughter.
The jury exonerated the railroad
company and its employes from
blame for the killing of Merritt Schu
ohardt, three and a half years old.
who was run over by a Howard-street
electric car.
PROMINENT CLUBMAN HI'RT
BY FALLING FROM A CAR
V. C. Driflield Suffers Painful Injuries
by Alighting From Moving
Vehicle.
V. C. Driftield, a prominent member
and officer of the Bohemian and
Olympic clubs and manager of the
Transatlantic Fire Insurance Com
pany, was the victim of a serious and
painful street car accident on Wednes
day night, which will r>e the means
of confining him to his home for a j
long period.
Mr. Drlffield had taken a Pacific- \
avenue car on his way home and on ,
reaching Octavia street attempted to
alight and in doing so lost his bal
ance and was precipitated to the
ground. The car passed over one of
his hands, crushing all of the fingers
in such a manner that it is doubtful
whether hÂ« will be able to retain the
use of them. His shoulder was also
severely hurt and other parts of his
body were badly bruised from the
rough treatment it was subjected to.

Mother of Allen Goucher
FATHER'S OBJECTION
Thinks 'That the District
Attorney Was Attempting
to Uuide the Witness
For the first time since the begin
ning of the trial of Allen Goucher,
charged with complicity in the mur
der of Policeman Eugene C. Robinson
on the night of January 20, 1902. the
sister of the murdered man was pres
ent in court yesterday. Miss Robinson
is a resident of Plumas County. She
and her mother, who lives with he;,
were very much dependent for support
upon the unfortunate policeman. Miss
Koblnson arrived here from Plumas
yesterday morning.
Mrs. Cioucher was again an inter
ested spectator. Ex-Senator Goucher
was at the side of his son Allen during
the cross-examination of William Hen
derson, who was with Goucher on the
night of the shooting, and who has
been giving evidence for the prosecu
tion.
During the morning session ex-Sen
ator Goucher dramatically objected to
the "manner of leading. the witness,"
as he put it, by District Attorney By
ington.
Henderson, however, seemed to make
a good witness and was not easily
"led." At the afternoon session By
ington made objections that were sus
tained in most cases by Judge Cook,
as it seemed apparent that Attorney
Reese Clark's line of examination,
while thorough, was to a certain ex
tent irrelevant.
Henderson repeated the story of the
attempted robbery of the safe at Cy
press Lawn Cemetery, and the subse
quent shooting of Robinson. He said
that when he turned around he saw
flashes from three revolvers, one of
which was in the hands of Goucher.
the other in Woods' hands and the
third presumably the pistol of the
prostrate policeman. Nothing of es
pecial bearing was brought out during
the cross-examination in the afternoon,
as Henderson was questioned simply
on a line tending to establish a basis
for impeaching his testimony.
During the trial young Goucher sat
next to his father, facing the witness.
He took a keen interest in proceedings
and occasionally whispered something
to his parent when Henderson showed
any signs of weakening in his replies.
It was developed that Henderson bor
rowed the pistol with which he fought
the duel with Policeman Taylorâ who
pursued him after Robinson was shotâ
from John Crowley, who keeps a resort
on Mason street, between Turk and
Eddy. Henderson added that Crowley
had not the slightest Idea what tlve
pistol was going to.be used for.
The cross-examination of Henderson
will be resumed this morning at 10
o'clock.
YOELL LAWYERS ARGUE OVER
ADMISSION OF DOCUMENT
Several Witnesses Called by Contest-
ants in Rebuttal of Previous
Evidence Submitted-
The Jury in the Toell case was ex
cused yesterday morning while the
counsel for the participants argued
over the admission of documents and
letters. At the conclusion of the argu
ment Judge Kerrigan took the mat
ter under advisement.
The jury resumed its place at 11
o'clock and the hearing of witnesses
called in rebuttal by Attorney Hoefler
for the contestants was resumed.
Their testimony was purely technical
and threw little new l'ght on the case.
A letter written by John Kay. in
which he professed great affection and
loyalty for Yoell, was read and ad
mftted. He later testified that he had
written it at the request and dictation
of Yoell. who told him that he needed
some sort of consolation. The other
witnesses called in rebuttal were: J. C.
Wasson. Anne L. Robinson, Robert A.
Jackson. Alice M. Hopkins. William A.
Yoell. Herbert A. Yoell and Gertrude
Yoell. The next hearing is set for
Monday morning at 11 o'clock.

SUES HUTTON
FOR OLD DEBT
31 rs. H. H. Hart Wants Ke
pa.vment of Coin Spent by
Her in Caring for His Wife
New trouble for ex-Police Commis
sioner Harry Hutton appeared yester
day when Mina G. Hart and H. H.
Hart brought suit against Inez S. Hut
ton and Harry Hutton, her guardian,
for the recovery of $619, said to have
been sj#nt by the plaintiffs during the
time Mrs. Hutton left her husband and
went to Salt Lake City.
The affair is the outcome of the trou
ble that took place between Hutton
and his wife in February of 1903. The
plaintiffs in the suit allege that at the
time of the temporary separation of the
Huttons Mrs. Hutton appealed to Mrs.
Hart, who was then living- in Mendo
cino County, to accompany her and act
as her companion and protector.
Mrs. Hart accepted the offer and
came to San Francisco, from which
place the couple left for Salt Lake City.
They stayed there a month, during
which time Mrs. Hart alleges she paid
all the expenses of board and care,
even including the tickets to Salt Lake
and the meals en route.
When the Hutton troubles were aired
in court in April, 1903, prior to a recon
ciliation and the assumption of guar
dianship by Hutton, it was attempted
to prove by Hutton that Mrs. Hart
was keeping Mrs. Hutton in restraint.
The itemized account of the bill is
as follows: For board for one month
ending March 11, 1903. furnished to IneÂ«
S. Hutton. $60; money paid out for
meals for Mrs. Hutton on trip to Salt
Lake City, $10; Mr*. Hutton's room
rent in Salt Lake City. $14; fare paid
from Salt Lake City to Sam Francisco.
$25; loan to Mrs. Hutton. $5; Incidental
expenses of homeward trip to San
Francisco. $5; for services rendered in
caring for and protecting the person of
Mr?. Hutton, S500: total. $619.
