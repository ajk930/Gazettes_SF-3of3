even the bakeries will be 1 ; closed. It was
proposed in Moscow to exempt the elec

While the Infant Sleeps, Fire \
Begins to Fill Room It
Occupies.
OAKLAND. Dec. 20.â Unmindful of the*
peril .to themselves, Agnes Ringer, a
nursegirl, and Delia Brennan. a domestic,
saved Walter A. Starr Jr., the Infant son
of Mr. and Mrs. Walter A. Starr, and
grandson of A. A. Moore, the prominent"
attorney, from being burned to death at
the Star? residence, 300 East Twentieth
s treÂ«t. Into the bedroom where the boy
was sleeping, half smothered by smoke
and near to death from flames that had,
their origin- in a lace curtain, the two
girls made their way and seizing tha
sleeping baby fought their way through
the fire and downstairs to safety, though
both the heroic young ' women were ' al
most stifled by the heat and smoke.
The rescued child was borne quickly to
the Moore home, across the street, whero
the little* one was speedily revived, non-5
the worse v for the experience.
â; Startling as' was the experience of the
young ,herotnes, . the occurrence was
doubly dramatic, from the, fact, that the
parents w*re away from home, attending
the '.'wedding rat: Berkeley ' of : Hugh Good
fellowsand-Jean Downev.;L - "â¢.;. I ..*,
'The first warning of the fire, which'lt Is

Brennan, who saw the upper part of. the*
Starr residence la flames from , the : Moora
home. ; She. aroused Mlv Margaret Moore,
the only member of the â¢ family v who was
at home,' and ran over to the Starr dwell
tog- ..-./- ' - â¢ '
FIGHT WAT TO BABY.
Miss Ringer was downstairs, oblivious
ot the flames that had got. under head
way, to the great danger, of the child
in the bedroom. -
Miss r Brennan found the door locked
and she rang and rang the bell/ arousing
the nursegirl. who was th^n for the first
time apprised . of -the fire.
With a scream the nursegirl, . followed
by hÂ«r sudden caller, ran upstairs. ThÂ«
smoke had begun to pour out of the bed
room and fill the hallways. Nothing
daunted Miss Ringer and her companion
fought their way to the baby's crib, and
were as quickly out of the house.
Miss Moore, as soon as she learned
that the baby was safe, telephoned to
the Downey residence and gave word of
the fire to her brother, Stanley Moore. HÂ«
summoned the Starrs, who with Mr. and
Mrs. A. A. Moore and J. J. Valentin^
Jr.. left the wedding scene hurriedly and
to , the Starrs automobile headed for
home, making a record-breaking run. for,
the Starrs did not know. then whether tha
child was unharmed. In their Ignorance
of what had occurred the wedding guests
whose pleasure had been so seriously dis-.
turbed hastened home in distress. It was
with much relief upon arriving that thejj
found the infant was safe. -The automo
bile was at the Starr home - -while tha
firemen were extinguishing the last sparks
about the roof.V. .
CAUSE OF BLAZE.
The flrebrokyft out shortly after . 1
o'clock. While Miss Margaret Moor*
said she believed the flames caught from
a gas jet. the firemen thought a defect
ive flue caused the blaze, because It was
confined mainly to tnÂ« roof and attic.
Miss Moore notified neighbors of the fire
after the boy had been rescued, and
Harry Lflteral and Ernest Mathies turned
In an alarm ; from box 145. Neighbors
formed a rescue brigade and saved much
of the furniture and other household
effects. The- damage will be $4000 or $3000
to the residence and the contents.

the girls who had rescued the baby. Sh*

' American Military Attache SayÂ« They.
Fought Bravely.
NEW YORK, Dec. 20.â Major Mont
gomery M. Macomb of the artillery, the
"last American officer to leave the staff of
the Russian army in Manchuria, and who
arrived last evening from Southampton,
said that he had left the array in Oc
tober and that at that time the discip
line was excellent. Political agitators had
not then begun their work of creating
disaffection.
Toward the close of the war the Rus
sian army was getting better all the
'time, even under its successive defeats.
Never once had the Russians been sur
rounded by the Japanese. Their retreats
had been masterly. If the war had been
continued much longer both sides would
have found their resources nearly ex
hausted. It was a . good stroke of dip
lomacy for the Japanese to end it in a
manner po satisfactory to themselves.
The major said the Russian soldier was
brave a.nd obedient. He has had a good
chance io ihui om, as he has been with
'the Russian army from the beginning to
the end of the conflict.

he did not ; complain. He! left the house
at 8 o'clocf and reported for duty at the

he was attacked with severe pains ; ln his j
chest and he went to his home and re- j
tired. {
Dr. J. W. Keeney, the family. physician, [

The passing of . John Spillane * takes
from the Police . Department a man who '
leaves " behind an unclouded reputation;
Honesty, fearlessness and charity were
traits of his character and as a protector i
of the public's welfare he was a shining .
example. The men under him were grief
etricken when the news of his death was ,
broken and . : gloom was ' cast ; over , the !
Southern Station. 1 The Southern has been J

Though no funeral arrangements have .
been made, the police will pay fitting re- ;
spect at the funeral. Lieutenant . Michael j
Joseph . Conboy, who \u25a0worked by the side
of . the deceased captain for many , years
and was one of. his closest friends, said:
\u25a0"Many" a person who \u25a0 came Into the â¢ sta- ,
tion for a night's lodging he would give \u25a0-*
money to. that the homeless one might .
have a better bed." ;
The death of his daughter about six J
years ago was a sad blow' to Captain ,
Spillane and It weighed upon him as
years went by. - She was young and met
a peculiar death from blood poisoning, !
caused from treatment of a tooth. ;
. About three years ago; he was stricken
with two attacks of heart trouble and at
one time his, life was. despaired, of. .One '
of these occurred \u25a0at McAllister and Lar

Monday night; the Chicago Chronicle, a"
newspaper owned by John R. Walsh, ex
pressed the following editorial sentiment
on reckless* banking,- under the caption
"Let Justice Be Done":
There is a law of the nation imposing: penal
ties upon national " Ijank officers \u25a0 who violate
the. wholesome provisions of ' the statutes.
Whether ' the authorities wu> . proceed, as Is
their duty, against- the officers responsible for
the wrecking of the National Bank, of Illinois
remains to be determined. These officers . de
liberately violated the trust imposed upon them,
set the national bank law at defiance, and.
there is good reason to believe, accepted \ com
missions from debtors . to make loans that no
persona 'acting -In - Rood faith i. would â¢ hare
dreamed of making. To conceal the enormity of
their proceedings, even from the directors, they
â¢talsiiied .. accounts and rte*e : >brMgbt . distress
a large number . of people. ?TEven-hande<l

notice on friends of . her husband herÂ©
that ; she will not meet him to talk over
a possible reconciliation- A close friend
of 3lrs. Corey in Braddock said to-nlghl:
." "Mrs. Corey will meet her husband If
her attorneys think It ceccs3ary, and
then only in the pre?ence-of her attor
neys. She has . served notice that she
will not discuss in any way a recon
ciliation \ with her husband, nor will she
meet; him; at his- father's home or at
anylother person's home."
The speaker Is familiar with ail phases
of the . Corey trouble and this informa
tion was brought forth by the publication
here of .a story that there was to be a
reunion at the home of A. .A. Corey next
Sunday evening, at which W. Ellis Corey
ajid ; his 'wife ;â¢ probably would make . up
their differences. _ Mrs. Corey has , de
clined absolutely, to consider a proposition
to forgive her husband. ,whose infatua
tion for Mabelle Gllman, 'the actress, has
made him the ' most-talked-about man In
the country.
Corey is making desperate efforts to
head off the ."attempt of his wife to try
for a divorce In" Pittsburgh Before she
left Los Angeles an attorney there was
sent to offer her terms of reconciliation.

It was ur Los Angeles, according to the
friends of Mrs. Corey, that the proposi
tion to meet at the home of Corey's fa
ther here was made .and refused. -Al
leged double dealing on the part of her
husband Is the principal reason advanced
by close friends of Mrs. Corey for her
coming from the West to Plttaburs for

that-. Corey tried '. to Injure her in Ne
vada and attempted to set up a case
against: her so that she might aot brinsr

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.â Confirmations
by the Senate of the nominations of,- the
members of the Isthmian Canal Com
x&ission were reconsidered to-day In the
executive session, and a motion was
adopted calling upon the President for
the return of the notification of the
Eenate'a previous action. When this has
been done the nominations again will
\u25a0be referred to the Interoceanlc Canal
Committee for consideration.
Before the decision was reached to re
consider the vote, charges of "railroad
ing'" nominations were made by several
minority Senators and countercharges
that the protestants were proceeding in a
manner not prescribed by the rules of the
Benate were made by Republican Sena
tors. The situation developed the fact
that there had been no poll on the canal
commission nominations in question, and
as a result objection to reconsideration
was withdrawn. \u0084 .
It Is generally understood that the pur
pose cf the minority Senators in asking
the Senate to have the nominations re
turned is to permit a protest against
Chairman Theodore P. Shonts holding a
position on th< commission and the presi
dency of the Clover Leaf Railroad at the

BILL TO QUASH
CUBAN TREATY
Xeedham' lntroduces Measure
*in the; House to Life
of flic Eeciprocity Pact
PLAX G AIXS SUPPORT
Claimed That the Island Re
public Has -Not Given the
United States Square Deal
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Dec- 30.â Representative
Needhara of California to-day Introduced
a bill for the abrogation of the Cuban
reciprocity treaty." Needham yesterday
offered this proposition in committee as
an amendment to the Philippine tariff bill,
but it was ruled out by Chairman Payne
as not germane.
The suggestions, however, brought on
an informal discussion that developed
considerable favorable sentiment among
the members of the " committee. Dalzell
of Pennsylvania, a- member of the Ways
and Means Committee, and one of the
high priests of protection, is declared to
favor the bill. Needham believes there is
a strong srfntiment in Congress in support
of his measure. â¢
Needham's move is not only for the pur
pose of protecting beet sugar; interests
of California, but is a warning to Cuba
that she must discontinue her discrimi
nation against the United States. It is
also meant to impress her with what she
may expect if she persists in arranging
a reciprocity treaty with Great .Britain.
Needham said to-day that the revenues of
our Government from Cuban sources had
fallen off since the treaty went into ef
fect and that in addition the people of
the Island were patronizing foreign mar
kets largely instead of those of this coun
try. N ;
Senator Perkins has received a number
of reauests from individuals and com
mercial organizations in California re
questing that Monterey be made a port of
entry. The treasury officials declare
there is no necessity for action in the
matter by Congress, and that if deemed
advisable Monterey may" be made a sub
port of entry of San Francisco. The Sec
retary of the Treasury in his discretion
may determine this. Under the circum
stances the passage of a bill making Mon
terey an entry port would be extremely
doubtful.
Frank Dillingham of* California was
nominated to-day to be Consul General
at Coburg, Germany. Dillingham. has
been In the consular service for several
years, and was recently assigned to a
similar place at Stuttgart The Consul
at Stuttgart desired to remain and Dil
llnghaxn'a transfer to Coburg was ar
ranged. \u25a0 . .
A monument to the memory of the sail
ors who lost their lives by reason of the
explosion of the boilers on the United
State* gunboat Bennington, at San Diego,
Cal.. is proposed in a bill introduced to
day by Senator Flint. The bill appro
priates $5000 to be used with a like amount
to be raised by popular subscription.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. â The only
notable feature of the open session of
the ' Senate to-day was a brief discus

Edward Fitzgerald Jammed
;and Mangled in a Bad
Street Line Collision
GEAVEL CAUSES DAMAGE
Carelessness of Workmen
at .a Switch Besults
in a Violent â Smash-Up
Another chapter/ In the" cycle of
street car accidents cost Edward: Fit
zgerald, a saloon-keeper of 544 Mission
street, one leg last night. ' â¢ .
Car JCo. 691 of- the : Mission and
Guerrero streets line collided } In a pe
culiar manner- with a gravel car at .the
corner of , Fourteenth -. and ': Mission
streets shortly before 11 p. m. Fitz
gerald was riding, on the step of the
trolley. His left j leg was crushed be
tween the two' vehicles and almost
torn off below the knee. -V . .
Manuel Krull of 165 Arlington street,
who rode next to Fitzgerald/was badly
bruised and lacerated â¢ about the legs:
The accident was caused by gravel In
the switch which made the j rear truck
of the passenger . car \u25a0 leave the track
and crash into the gravel car.' '
The collision, which appears jto have
been due to \u25a0 gross carelessness on the
part of the workmen who were unloading
the gravel car, occurred at 10:50 p. m.
The trolley had Just started around the
turn, running from Mission into; Four
teenth street. Standing on the opposite
track on Fourteenth street was gravel car

Crooks. â¢ -.â¢â¢\u25a0; \u25a0 â¢ N . â¢ \u25a0 '
GRAVEL PALLS ON RAILS.'
The gravel, which was ' being dumped
around the rails of the new cut-off," fell
over the rails. It was not all taken off
before car 854 arrived at the corner. Half
around the turn the passenger car wheels
ran on the gravel In the groove of the
rails. The rear trucks lef t ; the rails and
the rear body of the car crashed against
the dirt car. â¢
Fitzgerald occupied the extreme' rear
position on the car. steps. The collision
came so suddenly that he had no time to
jump. / â¢ v ' r .
Caught like a rat In a trap, . Fitzgerald
vainly attempted to raise himself by the
sheer force of his arms, clinging to .the
stanchions. He was not quick enough,
however. His left leg was i caught be-[
tween the two cars and ' literally ; torn
ofE. . Riding on . the ; steps ; Just In; front
of him were Krull and . Edward ; Kelley, :
a clerk at Seventh and Townsend streets.
Krull was thrown, heavily against.-, the.
gravel car, but escaped with , minor- in
juries. . .Kelley escaped with a s shaking
up, as did James Yeates, a carpenter jof
96 Sanchez street, who .was. thrown off. i
FITZGERALD TAKEN > OUT.
Fitzgerald was extricated and'removed
to the Central Emergency Hospital. The
aid of ; the Fire Department had to be
secured to release the Injured | man from
the wreckage. He was operated upon
by Dre. Millar, Glover and Tillman, his
leg being amputated above the knee.
Though suffering the most excruciating
pain, Fitzgerald never complained, but
bore his pain bravely, 'it Is believed that
his great will power will aid in his re
covery.
Manuel .Krull was taken to the Southern
Pacific Hospital, % where "- he ' was 'cared
for by Dr-.C, A. \u0084\Valker.\ s .
The passenger. . car" f Iwas', In charee of
Motorman Geprge Wheeler and .Conductor
J. McFeeley. v , !â\u25a0.,;'".
Some eyewitnesses allege, that Motor
man Wheeler rounded . the curve at .too
high a. rate of speed. This Is denied by
Wheeler.

ALAMEDANS DESIRE
TIDAL CANAL OPENED
Citizens Urge That the
Waterway Be Made
Navigable.
ALAMEDA. Dec. ao.â Now that Colonel
W. H. Heuer and L. J. Le Conte. engineers
In charge of the Federal Government
work on Oakland harbor, having denied
the report that the tidal canal, a part
of the harbor project, is to be closed,
the civic organizations of this city and
Fruitvale are to redouble their efforts
to have the big artificial ditch connecting
Oakland harbor' and San Leandro Bay |
opened for the uses of commercial enter- 1
prises and navigation.
Resolutions have been adopted by the
advisory board representing all of the |
improvement associations In this city, i
urging each ' club to recommend to the
City Trustees and to Congress that the
tidal canal be declared a navigable
waterway. Resolutions have also been
passed by the Board of Trade of Fruit
vale favoring the opening of the canal
to commerce and announcing the purpose
of that body to work in harmony with
local organizations to bring about the
end desired.
W. J. Grubb, secretary of the Fruit
vale Board of Trade, states that the or
ganization he represents has forwarded
letters to Senator Perkine and Congress
man Knowland, requesting them to en
deavor to have the Federal Government
open the tidal canal 6o.as to give direct
access from San Leandro Bay to Oakland
harbor. As it is now, with the draw
bridges closed, a vessel to go from Oak
land harbor to San Leandro Bay has
first to go west to the end of the train
ing walls of Oakland harbor, then round
the Alameda mole and double back up
the south 6Jde of Alameda and through
the Bay Farm Island drawbridge into
San Leandro Bay.
President C. S. Ncal of the Alameda
Advancement Association Eays that he
Â«JoÂ«s not believe that Colonel Heuer real
izes the growing importance of the east
end of Oakland harbor and the tidal
canal in connection with the properties
of San Leandro Bay as a site for manu
facturing plants when the shores of Oak
land harbor shall have been entirely oc
cupied.

NO EVIDENCE
Dr. Whitaker. Cries Graft,
but Declines to Furnish
the Proof of Wrongdoing
.;' | *
OAKLAND, Dec. 20.â The Rev. - Robert
Whitaker. pastor' of the Twenty-third
Avenue Baptist Church, . who - made
sweeping charges of graft and crime 1 in
Oakland, failed to substantiate them to
day at a conference -with the Police .and
Fire Commissioners. The clergyman, : in
a' lengthy statement, made several spe
cific accusations, . but he declined to - give |
the commissioners information upon '
which they might investigate.
At" the â¢ outset - Dr. Whitaker declared
that taxes were too high and improve
ments too slow. He. did not blame the :
city officials for this condition. With
relation to the alleged existence of crime
in- Oakland he cited the case of Mrs.
Julia Gurnett, whose death was suspected
as murder. But : the clergyman admit
ted that this suspicion had been cleared.
He also. referred to the mistrial of Percy,
Pembroke, the finding of "a body at Oak- |
land mole, the McNulty case of Berke r i
ley and the Cook .* murder case at j Fruit 7 j
vale. Dr. Whitaker contended \ that the i
Oakland police had been negligent In the I
Cdok case. He made charges that the
east end of the city had been terrorized
by hoodlums. He complained that police
men slept on duty. He asserted that two
policemen had been killed while on duty,
one . of whose murderers had not been
apprehended. ..
The clergyman asserted he had been
told by the confession of a city employe
that his informant had paid tribute of
one-third or one-fourth of his salary to
a politician who" had got him the : posi
tion. Dr. Whitaker also asserted a man
had told himthat a contracting firm had
been robbing the city.
These specific charges induced Mayor
Mott, City Attorney McElroy; and City
Engineer Turner to press Dr. Whitaker
to disclose sufficient clew to give "them
a chance to get at the facts, but the
pastor declined on, the ground that the
communications to him were in the , na
ture of sacred confessions. \u25a0
City Councilmen Fitzgerald, Meese,
Baccus, Donaldson, Hahn and McAdam
requested permission to sit with the com
missioners during the conference, but the
board preferred to hear. the pastor alone.
The councilmen I requested the clergyman
to appear Tuesday evening before the
City Council with any further statement
as to the alleged existence of graft and
crime he might desire to make. This Dr.
Whitaker agreed to do.

from her the story of 7s her- husband's

by the university . for the loss. She In
formed Professor Edwards that she had

him was that the flimsy construction of
the bleachers was responsible for Budde

plumber, a prominent, fraternal man and
an enthusiast in â¢ sporting ; matters. .He
attended the freshman football game and
eat on an unfinished portion of the

Trustees Find Fault With

Franchise to Corporation
Baecial Dlsratch to ThÂ« Call.
SAN MATEO, Dec. 20.â A legal action
that promises to be something out of the
ordinary la threatened by the municipal
ity against the Southern Pacific Com
pany. . In seeking to force the railroad
company to keep In proper repair certain
streets upon which the corporation has
been granted a franchise by the town au
thorities the Board of Trustees has made
the startling discovery that on October
4, 1880, the Board of Supervisors granted
the use^f two very valuable strips of
land exclusively to the Southern Pacific
Company.
It is claimed now by the Board of
Trustees that the . Supervisors had no
right to alienate in this manner the prop
erty of the municipality and City Attor
new Kirkbride'has been instructed to see
what may jbe done v by the city to regain
possession of its lands. It Is feared that
the statute of limitations has long since
operated and. that the town may have no
redress at law.
It is interesting In this connection that
ho improvement may be made on these
streets, as the Southern Pacific . Com
pany refuses to do anything and the" town
authorities do : not care to , Improve at
publio-^xpense property in which the city
has no title. { \u25a0"\u25a0

ation of a substantial business com

by the hundreds of homes which havÂ»Â»i
sprung Into existence here, that property
owners and residents have organized the
Burllngame Improvement Club. Tha
membership Is an enthusiastic one and
comprises everybody practically of Im
portance In this community.
The club . has several Interesting and
Important measures to consider and urge
upon voters. Not the least important
and radical of these suggestions will be
a proposition to obtain the incorporation
of Burlingame as a town of the sixth
class. Ways" and means to secure street
lights, sidewalks, gas and some provi
sion for the establishment of a sanitary
district are matters that will receive Im
mediate attention from the club. Nothing
will be left undone to make Burllngame
as desirable as possible to horns seekers.
The proposition of incorporation . has al
ready become a matter of comment in
San Jlateo and the suggestion la made
there that instead of creating a new
town here It will be better for. the people
of Burlingame to annex themselves to
San Mateo and be ruled by the local of

CHINESE ACTOR
WREAKS SPITE
Retired for Cause, He Stands^! Theater Door
and Derides Stage Performance. ;
Warns Caucasian Slunrimers to Stay Outside
if They Desire to Avoid Ennui.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
*'Hlm heap lotten show!"
Ah Ju voiced the words . as a slumming
party of white folk approached the Chi
nese Theater, on Washington t street with
evident intent to enter therein.
The warning had desired effect. A femi
nine member of the advancing -group .' ab
ruptly halted and, addressing the official
cicerone, exclaimed: . "That Settles Itâ
we don't go ln. Gracious knows, one has
enough difficulty dodging dramatic';un
worth in our own language to be eager,
to go . up against the same thing [in un
intelligible. Jargon." 'y "-., '
The sentiment was unanimously V in
dorsed by her companions, and,/ despite
the expostulations of the guide, they
tendered a vote. of thanks to' Ah' Ju: and
then turned away from the entrance. :
"That Chink," protested the guide, al
luding to Ah Ju, "is ' knockin' . th' show
because he was fired from - th' company
for his drunkenness an' bad actin'." He's
loaded \to the muzzle 1 right now with
Chinese gin.'\ But the. protest went un
heeded. '^^'- -,:.-..:
In the meantime Ah Ju leaned unsteadi
ly against the playhouse portal â¢\u25a0 and
chortled in gleeful triumph, while the
doorkeeper glared menacingly -at him.
"Why is it, O Ah Ju, that you, thus
shame our face in presence of the for
eign fools and deprive us ;of their
money?" inquired: the man in the box
office, a person whose dignity was_ in ac
cord with the importance ; of his position.
Replying In the vernacular, Ah Ju de
clared that revenge was \u25a0 sweet. â¢ "My
face was shamed by my ignominious dis
missal, O Pong ; Gue,"" he explained,
"and I but retaliate in kind. -Besides, my
words -to the foreigners 'were words of
truth. Your stage performance is, to
quote the phrase of a , most .scholarly
critic of Caucasian dramatics, 'extremely
punk." My; intention' is to stand here and
visit humiliation upon you and yours un
til the last act; Is played."
He made good his threat by shouting,
"Him damn punk show," whenever a
person not of his own race hove in sight,
and what he said to his compatriots was
apparently. , of similar import, _\u25a0 for after
he had spoken many :of them restored
their; money to their pockets instead of
transferring it to the dignified Pong Gue.
Thus it came that . he was arrested by
â¢Patrolman "Charlie" Brown- on Pong
Gue's complaint that he had disturbed
the peace. /. V
' "He was drunk when I ; took him in,"
said the officer to Police Judge Fritz,"
"and he ain't sober yet.". ' '
Ah Ju's vacuous facial = expression ' and
tottering gait corroborated j the latter ac
cusation, ; and he was sent back to the
cage, where he immediately lapsed into
oblivion.
Morgan J. Smith, ; arrested for "Bcalp-.
Ing" theater ' tickets on O'Farrell street,
declared he was not ;-\u25a0 a regular practi
tioner of that offense, V but was simply
endeavoring to dispose of two seats In the
Orpheum which i at : the last; moment : he
found himself unable: to use, owing to
the fact that Miss Janseh, residing at
the Windsor Hotel,' had broken her prom
ise to occupy ' one . of them. ::
\u25a0 Patrolman : Evett was" , in > plain ..attire
when* Mr. ; Smith ; offered \u25a0â¢;. to sell to him

was arrested at 3-o" clock yesterday'; morn-;

"How did you; come' to'be' sofar away

% "It's the low saloon license that did it,"
waa her reply.. Then ; she went .on ; to
elucidate that thÂ© '.vicinage" in which ? she.
dwells is thlokly i studded : with combined
groceries and barrooms,'! which â¢ would | not
be the case, if the ;" pecuniary , cost of - a
permit! to . retail , liquors were what ' the
high license advocates desire. -With *a
reduction ; in the number ; of ; groggeries,
she further/ explained, her. temptation to
tipple would be .; correspondingly .de
creased. Vlf one | happensto be thirsty,"
she added,' "and goes to buy groceries one
is tempted -to drink a ' glass of 'beer, and
one couldn't get beer in a grocery, store
if the' license. to"~sell If cost $500 a year:
The last thing I remember. doing yester-'
day was sipping a glass of beer while_the
grQcer was weighing some; sugar "and
other things I was ', waiting \ for. .. How in

more streets Is more than I know." .
â¢\u25a0; "Your v plea, while . not ' entirely devoid

his , : . Honor, "inasmuch as 8 there j would
not be; a' high license : law; in effect.at
this 'time even if it" had been; adopted
at .the last election.- So V your inebriety
cannot reasonably be ascribed; to the de
feat of the high license amendment."
"I ' wonder if that lawyer knew, what
he was talking about?*' Mrs. Carey solil
oquized. , *^ 7 . *
"And if any attorney .Â« or "other person
Informed you to the ' contrary," ';:re-*
joined 'the Judge, divining the. source of
her plea, ."he was : either an ignoramus
or a - malicious mischief-maker. I give
you thirty days'.^imprisonment."
"It'll ( take ; that long , to \ get my clothes
dried.'' ;said ; Mrs. '2 Carey, not in the least
dismayed; by ': her. sentence, .as she
clutched ; a . handful bedraggled skirt
and retired' to' the background.

Says Ordinance Should Pro^

\ lege to- Another Concern
The ; Supervisors'.; Street Committee met
yesterday, to consider ; the suggestions
made /at" last" Monday's", meeting by Su
pervisor. /d'Ancona- relative fran-"
chise Y> proposed .to - l ; be ; granted to ' - the
Ocean ; . Shore ? Railway .\u25a0 * Company \f or j a
branch' line to connect with j Its main line
at Armjr and /\u25a0.Vermont .: streets \u25a0 and ; run
ning along certain streets to ; Twelfth and
Market "streets. They suggestions which
D' Ancona desires ;to *i>e : . Incorporated ' in
the ', franchise . Include the \ reservation -of
the r right of ; the city.' s to require the elec
tric t feed wires \u25a0to be placed underground
at A any, time, ' that j the roadbed ; of , the line
revert to \ the city . at the end of th c frah
chiee.'y and \; that ; a* percentage ; of the re
ceipts be paid to the. city, according to
the ; charter.
' D'Ancona questioned whether ilt la " to
the 7, best interests i of i the; city " to , grant
an additional ; franchise. He suggested
that there . is nothing â¢ In .. the proposed
franchise to - prevent a Its ; acquisition ' by,
say, the Southern Pacific .Company, which
could^ operate^ a' steam' foad on Twelfth
street, \u25a0 terminating >'at Market.
\i''. We have: had an Instance 'of the trans
ferrihg.of ia' franchise,'* 'said D'Ancona,
"in- the taking, over of { most of our street
car lines ;. by v - the United.: Railroads,:; a
foreign \u25a0 corporation.:;; I : question , the " wis
dom â¢ of ; allowing a [ steam" road : to j come
into 3 the city, and while I : do :not ;thlrik
the ; franchise be < denied," yet* this
committee should I consider^ the ; proba
bilities of I the privilege. <\u25a0 There should be
some provision relative ( to the sharing qf
the ' tracks *, by other ; companies,' for it
may be , that a union' depot ' for transcon
tinental; lines at Market "and -Twelfth
streets.: This board -cannot be accused
of being, inimical to ;the Ocean Shore
Company, â¢ for,: It has , ! granted It : a fran
chise - for Its main â¢ line in T the city limits
and , also one . of _ doubtful validity in \ the
Sunset; and .Richmond districts and cross
ing the park."".
SAYS TERM . IS TOO LONG.
E.t P. Troy addressed ' the committee In
behalf of 'the .Municipal Ownership
League, which -had filed a communica
tion embodying \ a series of conditions to
be " imposed upon ; the ', company -as : a re
turn for the grant of the; franchise. v Troy
held that a fifty. years', franchise was for
too : long ; a term and should -be limited
to . twenty-five i years and that : safeguards
should- be thrown around the crossing of
the . road Vat , intersecting streets.
The committee took the matter under
advisement \u25a0' and \u25a0 will consult .with Chair
man j Braunhart before . making a report
next Tuesday. ' ; ' ; : .. ' \u25a0
The' committee '; requests , the Board of

of the easterly half of Baker street, from

street,^ M."' Toplitz, \ objects- to-paying for

WANT OILED STREETS.
: Representatives , of the : West ; of; Castro
Club urged ,*the | committee: to* recommend
an ordinance providing" that the city care^
for roadways %of "streets ; that -, have been'
treated with oil. It was pointed out that
many blocks in the . outlying districts
could /be . improved ''where'- the , property
is not of sufficient' value to .warrant a
more expensive ' pavement. ; The petltion-r
ers were- directed' 1 to confer with /;the
Board of -.Works relative to \u25a0 the drafting
of the necessary ordinance.
The committee recommended the build
ing," under a \u25a0 private contract, of a sewer
In China; avenue from Athens street to

PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPY.
THE Salvation Army has continually enlarged m its scheme for
helping the needy tq help themselves. Its first motto, "Soup,
Soap and Salvation," indicated a practical purpose. In this
country it has founded many rural . colonies by taking dependent
people out of cities and settling them upon land. Large numbers
of those colonists were found among the social dregs and* were
rescued from squalid and sodden conditions that would have dis
couraged any people Jess stout hearted than the sturdy and shouting
soldiers that majce up General Booth's world-belting army.
The tattered flotsam and jetsam, the drift that rots in* the
eddies of the human flood of great cities, is taken to the country,
beyond temptation, where a fall from grace or return to the domi
nation of low appetites is unlikely, because there is no chance to
practice drunkenness and other vices. These colonists get tracts
of land which are developed by their labor and finally paid for by
their earnings. It is General Booth's wise policy to take the poor
away from pauperism. If their land were given to them outright
it would further pauperize them. Therefore, they are taught to
look forward to independent ownership. . ;
These colonies are under expert oversight. It would astonish
the people who think that the Salvation Army is entirely devoted
:o blowing indifferent music, singing religious songs and ungram
matical rhapsody in the form of street preaching, to know the
exactness of its business organization and methods. It fraternizes
all religious sects, and prays, preaches and practices with, equal
earnestness and fervor. Among its leaders are some of the greatest
men and women in the world. General Booth himself is a leader
of men equal to any that has lived, and in his method and purpose,
and the effect of his work upon the sinful arid suffering, the fallen
and lowly, stands to-day at the head of the human race. His fort
resses are in every land, and people of every race and nationality
are on the roster of his army. The property accumulated for the
purpose of rescuing the weak and wicked amounts to many millions
of dollars, and not a penny of it is for self-aggrandizement or per
sonal use. His soldiers go where no others venture. No slum is
too foul, no sinner too wicked, to be beyond their reach.' The men
and women they reclaim bring into the ranks of the righteous no
past, but are naturalized as citizens of that republic of God in which
all are equ^l.
The charities of the army are organized. It wastes nothing
and its efforts never cease. Though a man or woman fall ninety
and nine times, its patience is unflagging and goes again and again
to the rescue of the perishing. So it has come to be judged not
by its sometimes grotesque exterior, nor the lack of harmony in its
music, but by the mightiest work for reclamation of the fallen and
needy that the world has seen.
General Booth does what kings and princes cannot do. ""The
poor of London are in great straits this winter. Their hearts are
hardened against a world that feeds and clothes them scantily.
Members of the royal family appeared in public at a charity func
tion in their behalf and were hissed and hooted by those they
wanted to help. But General Booth appears with a plan for buying
country estates upon which to settle these poverty maddened un
fortunates. Immediately money pours into his hand, a half million
from one man, and the. General is able to reassure the King and
the Government, by draining off the great city's marsh of want
and woe, for settlement on land, where the people will; produce
to supply their needs, and which they will finally pay for and be
come landed proprietors. His schemes of colonization . reach out
to Australia, to Africa, ever>*\vhere that suitable land and climate
can be found. He declares himself able to transport 5000 families
at once beyond seas to homes on land. That, means approximately
the redistribution of 25,000 people, and an inexpressible relief to a
city like London. 4'J "â¢>\u25a0- ?
The government of every country on earth feels an interest in
General Booth's work. In Washington he -dines with the Presi
dent of the United States. In London he is sent for by the King.
Since the nations of Europe all followed Peter' the Hermit to the
rescue of the Holy Sepulcher no man has had such a following
as General Booth in his march to the rescue of the souls and bodies
of men and women. The world has the assurance of perpetual suc
cession to him when he rests from his labors. The movement to
which he gave "initial impulse has gained such headway that its
force will increase and endure as long as want and woe and x wicked
ness are in the world.
ANOTHER FOOD REFORMER.
A CHICAGO doctor, named Tuetef, and noted as a food spe
cialist, has admonished the Medical Society^ of that city, and
through- its members their patients and all mankind, thai
beans, soup and pie are the enemies of human life, and must b/s
avoided unless we are reckless about length of days. He permits
meat once a day and it may be' boiled, broiled or roasted-r-never
1 fried. We must give up. wine and beer at meals, if our days would
be long in the land. We may eat spinach, asparagus, lettuce anrj
onions, and our only cold meat must be ham, which is a conces
siojv.ittiankfully received. We are never to eat to complete .satis
faction! but must short of it, and must .never 'take a full
stomach to bed with us. We are to be cheerful at meals, and why
not at other times? \u25a0 . ,
In the name of the bean raisers of California and the bean
eaters of New England, we demand disclosure- of the testimony,
on which that vegetable is indicted. The vital statistics of New
England show that the people live to a -great age, and Boston, alone
eats $6,000,000 worth of beans in a year.- What business has a
Chicago doctor to destroy our faith in beans? Japan whipped
Russia on a diet of rice and -soy beans.. The Germans whipped
France on a thick bean soup, though the French were strong with
onions. Jack the Giant Killer, raided beans on his celebrated stalk.
This docto^ frowns on potatoes, parsnips, pumpkins, turnips and
carrots, roasting ears, Hubbard squash, crooknecks' and tomatoes.
We can leave off tea and coffee, wine and beer as he orders, but
we insist on beans and a greater variety of vegetables, and. refuse
to be cheerful at meal times if they are not on the. table.
BAILEY AND DIGNITY.
THE young and shapely Senator from' Texas is. disquieted." Â» He
finds the Senate suffering from too much indictment, and tou
many convictions to please him. He fears impairment of his
personal dignity because the recklessr artists -find good cartoon
timber in his colleagues and even in the whole grave and reverend
body of which he is a conspicuous physical ornament, '-'"Heiis 1 of tlie
opinion that the dignity of the Senate should be like the virtue of
Mrs. Caesar, above suspicion, and , proposes that steps be '\u25a0'â¢'taken
to prohibit the artists and writers of quips from poking: pictures and
fun at it. To all of this the venerable Senator Daniel' romes to
judgment, with the opinion that the dignity of the Senate cannot
be r protected by an act entitled an act.
Senator Bailey is nothing if not a stickler- for form and de
meanor. He is himself that which is a joy forever.. He. has wrought
mightily to maintain the dignity of the Senate,; even to answering
another Senator's argument by assaulting him ' physically and fistic
ally, while the body was. in sessio.n and on. its sacred floor. He :i*J
willing" to. back Senatorial dignity against all comers for money, 5
marbles or chalk, and "will support , it in debate, rough house- or
foot race, matching pennies, or in any way : known to . his great Tphy/
sical resources. The Senate cannot 1 do, better? than create! a stand
ing committee on Senatorial dignity, to consist of Bailey, =for . he

; Â¥ /AST summer, while his son was re

1â '-Weir Mitchell told the young man's
patients that they might come to him. He
moved into" the son's office, and'the very;

\u25a0 expressed \ surprise and disappointment.
;He had ; expected ' to find the younger

abroad and that he was willing "to do the

"Oh/ yea. r understand that," said the

"But," .said D:v Mitchell.. "I shall

his practice till he returns."

STORY OF THE UTTLE BOY.
\u25a0 Once upon' a' time 5 there 'was a little boy
who : told very" naughty \ stories, and
hooked watermelons from Deacon Stark
weather's patch,* and \u25a0 played Â« hookey â¢ from
school,', and - went ' in swimming when ihe
had been told not to do so and afterward
told his loving mamma" that he had wet
his . hair .by : sweating so * profusely, .and
tied the kittles' tails together so as . to
see : what they would . do about ' it, . andâ
well, â¢he was a very bad little boy, in
deed! _ ' . . . .
"It. is quite shocking just to read about
such It not. -dear children? -
Why did the little boy act In this dread
ful manner? ..Was It because of original
sin? Or total depravity? Or ; congenital
cussedness?- : These 'suppositions may
seem: reasonable, but, after, careful' ccra
sideratien, I think" that they- are not. No:,
what, ailed the little boy, as \u25a0 nearly as . 1
can . figure It . out, . is that he had been
told by his parents not to do these things;
an-1 .so he ;= felt. that, he owed It to his
country, and himself to do all of. them,
omitting ' none, i This is principally what
ailed the little boy, and 1 know, for once
âa lorig, : long time agoâ l was i a little
boy myself.;" T .\ '. .';
1 Did^the bad little boy" growlupto be a
sha~me, disgrace 'and perp?taal blight to
his parents, as such little boys do in all
the . nice story books : you are recom-*
mended to read? Not by a jugful. Willie
and; Susie! On your, life," he didn't! He"
now, ls in. Congress from the Steenth dis
trict, and his mamma is so proud of him
that he and the family Bible are the only
subjects she ; fakes any interest In dis
cussing. .:..
This is the end of the story of the bad
little boy. dear, children, and I would not
dare to give its apparent' moral for fear
that; I mighf.be arrested for ; inculcating
unsound doctrineâ ami if : you do' not
know what that ; means, t>erhaps you can
get your 'dear parents ; to . tell ; you. '-
"I always take a greaf deal of satis

THROWING -THE SHOEâ Reader o 8
The Call. City. The following is an an
swer to' the question. '"Why do peopla
sometimes throw, a shoe after tha
bride?" The custom " of throwing a
shoe after a bride comes from tho
Jewish one of handing a shoe to a pur
chaser of land on the completion of a
contract. In the Bible (Ruth iv. 7-8>
there is:-. "Now this was the' manner in
former tl m c in : . Israel concern In g re
deeming and concerning changing, for
to confirm all things; a man plucked
off his shoe and gave- It to his neigh
bor: and this was a testimony In Is
rael. Â»\u25a0.. Therefore the kinsman saidv
unto Boaz. Buy. it for. thee. S"^
he drew, off his shoe." Parents also'
gave -a shoe "to ' " the . husband on a
daughter's marriage in toften of yield
ing up their authority. Urquhart In his
'â¢Pillarg of; " Hercules" says: "At a
Jewish marriage I was standing by. the
bridegroom when the bride entered. As
"she ; crossed the threshold hÂ« stooped
und struck her. with the heel of a shoo
on the nape of ;the neck. I at once
saw-the interpretation of " the passa^o
of Scripture respecting the transfer oÂ£
the shoe to another In case th*
brother-in-law did not exercise his
privilege*. The slipper In the East be
ins taken off indoors is at hand to ad
minister correction, and Is here used to
sljfnlfy ithe obedienc^ of .the wife" and
the supremacy of the "husband. Tho
Highland custom Is _to strlk* for good
lnoK.: 7 Â«Â» they* say. with an. old; shoe,
i .ittlo do they suspect the meaning im
plied." An*Â»th*r : writer says: "The
throwlnjr Â«Â»f * n * shoÂ« arose from
the father of -\,thÂ«- bride makinjc a

Its design is to help /the Elementary

has been left undone, although, it ; ought
to have been done, and the doing of it is
so relatively easy that the value of i this
new;- idea ,is immense^, as â¢ compared with
the'.mefeirnaterial .cost. .That . idea Via to

Jor a narrow, circle of
usefulness by* the simple addition "of a lit
tle more work to the amount which is
always accomplished, but has â¢ not been*
completely utilized. L The- '\u25a0"carefully

partments* in universities - specially pre^
pare for a few, students \ are - to> be pub
lished ; for a .wide circle of "readers. " .The

response has been most, generous; and

The new "iournal is <ay quarterly. The

by Dr. Margaret E. Schallenberger.vin
which she . sets forth the , new magazine's
reason for being.'-: There are" four articles
by experts in educational work. Anne M.'
Nicholson,- a; ; 8., gives "â¢ an 'elaborate six
ty-page study of the 'best methods to
teach language to the various grades. It
is so clever a paper that one needs not be
a teacher to become interested in reading
it." Educating the * third ! grade into the
love of language and the delights, of self-:
expression; '- she uses â¢as\u25a0 a ! sort of mental
lever the etrone -"make-believe" instinct
of children of that age, and makes them
play at being the characters whose words
she wishes .to impress .'upon their,memo
ries.. For instance, ; they are to imagine
themselves of 'Arthur's' court. ' One | boy
makes believe he -Is Sir -Lancelot giving
knighthood to Galahad,, who, kneeling;
thus repeats after Lancelot the oath to
be kept by noble knights:-"'
"I will be faithful to God and loyal to
the King. I will : reverence all women.
I will ever protect the poor, and helpless.

Yprk is soon to be pictured and described
in a book that will 'do its -great subject
justice. It is being prepared by a man
who has special talent and | a large ex

of America's "metropolis. Its pages will
be 10 by 15, and there will, be 400 large
photographs reproduced in half-tone to
show the immense and beautiful public
and private buildings. As New York con
tains many of the biggest and finest
things in the world, this great ' picture
book will show some, of the world's most
remarkable modern ; -progress. Accom

will be "King's Views of New York." _

wonderful New, York :-. skyscrapers, '.* of
which there are -650. Eighteen of these
have. an aggregate value of .$63,290,000.
Some, of the other blg^ figures given in
the work are that the,, local railways

downtown restaurants take \u25a0 in $1,200,000
each day for dinners; the; daily mail of
the city averages 3^716,000 pieces; the cost
of the public schools is $24,231,550 ; a year
and the annual output of the factories

-In coming to the Columbia Theater next
week William Hi* Crane will maku known
in '-The American Lord';. a- play in which
he has thus far J met with ' a lot of "favor.
The comedy is in four acts; opens in Da
â¢kota and then crosses 'seas to -England.^
It contrasts I Americans with a â lot of
English people high up in the social scale,
and the vein of satlresubtly.' aimed at the
easy ;\u25a0 going and methods ;of
\u25a0the Englfsh Is very entertaining. Â» ; \u25a0;"
"In building the comedy,; Broadhurst and

a type of the .fearless, progressive? and
aggressive American, \- who, . when "- he
awakes in the m6rning"andi fills his lungs
with the air of the^ prairies, can look any
man straight in the eye^ arid deliver cuss
words without injury to his conscience.;
It so happens that this : man comes from
old English stock,. and at a time when it
is likely that he is to receive, a nomina
tion for Congress ;he" is ; made aware that
he Is the; lineal descendant of an English
lord and ''heir, to considerable! estates in
! England.
Against his will he is forced; to go to
England and become a lÂ©rd. Once across
the ocean the transplanted American is
up against tradition and changed condi
tions. There area number of good parts
in the. play arid they are handled by peo
ple known to be capable, and artistic. .'

LEFT TO BODY DECIDES CONTEST
AGILE PHILADELPHIAN WEARS DOWN OPPONENT
Desperate Milling Marks the Fight
From Start, the Cornishman
Doing the Forcing.
After carrj'ing the fight to Jack O'Brien
for thirteen rounds in the Mechanics* Pa
vilion last night the strain on Bob Fltz
eimmons' vitality proved too great and
he was unable to respond to the call of
time in the fourteenth round.
Shortly before the end of the thirteenth
round O'Brien landed a vicious left hook
to Fitzsimmons' stomach. He followed
this up with a right to the head. Both
blows were severe ones, but they did
not show their effect at the moment.
Fitzsimmons went to his corner for the
one minute's rest allowed by the Marquis
of Queensberry rules. He had been seated
in his chair about half the allotted time
vhen he unexpectedly pitched forward
and would' have fallen to the floor had
his seconds not caught him. He col
lapsed completely after vomiting consid
erable blood. Referee Eddie Graney at
once awarded the light to O'Brien before
the surprised spectators knew what had
[happened.
Efforts were made by the men in the
rim to revive the veteran, whom they
quickly laid out on the fio&r of the ring.
Ther* were rails for a cloctor. and sev
eral responded. Fitz soon "came to" and
sat iÂ» his corner sobbing like a child,
mumbling over and over again "My heart
Is broken." He shook hands with O'Brien
to show there was no hard feeling-
The house was in an uproar, the spec
tators pressing forward to the ringside
to learn the condition of the injured
boxer. When Spider Kelly. O'Brien's
chief second, saw that Fitz was out of
danger, he called for three cheers for the
defeated man. They were given with a
will. O'Brien was congratulated on all
sides for his victory, and made a speech,
In which he said:
"Ladles and Gentlemen: I take no
credit in defeating one of the grandest
.men who ever stc-pped into the rins:. I
am now ready to fight any man In the .
â¢world for the middle-weight or heavy
weight championship, provided he--' is
white. lam particularly anxious to. meet
Tommy Ryan for the middle-weight title
or Marvin Hart for heavy-weight hon
ors, and I am ready to fight at short
notice." V :':'\u25a0'
Fitzsimmons* ultimate collapse had been
Â«xpecte<J for several rounds by the per
sons nearest the ring. The cumulative
force of O*BÂ»Hen's blows was seen to be
telling on the veteran' and it was consid
ered only a matter of time when the end
would come. Fitz eras knocked down, in
the third with a snappy left to the jaw.
lit* etruck the floor of the ring with a
crash that could be heard all over the
house. Fltz was down again in the fourth
and he went down the third; time , in"
the eighth round from a right to the Jiw.
He seemed to have reached the "end of .
his vitality in the ninth, but continued to
Improve for the next three rounds.
Throughout the fight O'Brien seemed to
be, putting in his best efforts in streaks.
He did considerable running away, but
when he stood up and fought his work
was Quite effective. His footwork,, and
ducking were marvelous to behold, car
rying him out of many dangerous places.
FITZSIMMOXS TRIES HARD.
It was pitiable at times to see Fitz's
â¢ fforts to land on the moving target in
front of him. O'Brien seemed wound up
like a mechanical toy and flitted about
the ring with a sarcastic smile on his
face. The spectators were with Fltz to
a man and cheered him from the time
his bald pate was seen coming down the
aisle to the ring until the fight ended so
disastrously for him.
The unexpected ending took from
O'Brien whatever glory a decisive vic
tory by a knockout would have given
him. Fitz could not control his feelings
In his dressing-room while the medical
men were working over him. His over
wrought nature gave way to tears and
he bemoaned the fate that had overtaken
him after all his years In the ring.
Fitz's showing was co good, for the
three rounds following the ninth that he
seemed to share with the spectators the
idea that ultimate victory would come to
him. In these rounds he summoned all
the strength and courage at his com
mand and took a last dying chance to
turn the tide of victory in his direction.
He seemed so Intent on landing the blow
he felt would take from O'Brien much
of his agility that he did not try to
guard his opponent's blows. He took
many hard knocks in an effort to send
home one punishing blow.
For some reason his Judgment of dis
tance proved defective throughout the
fight, as' he-juried many times without
landing on liis will-o'-the-wisp opponent.
The frequent visitation of O'Brien's left
changed the appearance of Fitz's coun-.
tenance materially. Both eyes were
badly damaged and there were numer-

O'BRIEN STOPS FITZSIMMONS IN THIRTEENTH
ous bumps and cuts on his fae* â¢which
was puffed almost beyond recognition.
His left eye was badly cut in the fourth
round, his nose having been damaged in
the previous round.
His right eye was nearly closed in the
seventh round. O'Brien .was cut" under
the left eye and also on the chin, but
when he left the pavilion the marks were
hardly noticeable. O'Brien was warned
many times by Referee Eddie Graney for
unfair tactics, particularly in the matter
of butting and Of using his elbow. Fitz's
patience In this regard gave out after a
time and he commenced to use the heel
of. his glove on O'Brien's nose and also
used his elbow on him. *
O'Brien had a wrestler's hold on Fitz's
neck a number of times and tried to shut
off his breath.
ATT^.\OA.\CB LARGE.
The attendance was beyond all expecta
tions, every point of vantage in the pa
vilion being otibupied by spectators. Man
ager Coffroth'S' Â»r!raster hand was seen
in the perfection -of the arrangements,
every detail of "which went with marked
smoothness. The ' first pair of prelimi
nary boxers wÂ«re In the ring promptly at
S:3O, and were through at 9:04. At 9:10
Eddie Graney v.-as seen -coming down the
aisle resplendent in his Tuxedo.
He was followed by O'iJrien and the
latter's seconds, who were greeted loudly
by the spectators. Their reception was
nothing to the cheers which went up
when Fitzsimmons, . minus his toupe,
came In sight. O'Brien had on a brown
dressing gown, while Fltz had nothing
but his ling costume on. ( The hands of
bo.lh boxers were covered with stout
driving gloves, the fingers of which had
been removed. v;";
Fitz seemed to be in the best possible
humor and went across the ring to shake
hands with O'Brien. The latter did not
see him and Fitz tapped him gently on
the head with a pair of boxing gloves Tie
held in his hand.
O'Brien was all smiles at once and
the rival gladiators shook hands warm
ly and exchanged pleasantries for a few
moments. In O'Brien's corner were Spi
der Kelly. Willie Fitzgerald, Battling
Swanson and other assistants. Under the
able guidance of Kel.y, O'Brien was much
bitter handled- throughout the fight than
Fitz. whose secondsâ Harry Chester,
Billy Bates and Young Crollâ were una
ble to render him much assistance at
any time. They were short on experi
ence.
Billy Jordan introduced O'Brien as "the
Beau Brummel" of the prize ring, while
Fitzsimmons was presented as "the mid
dle and light heavy weight champion of
the world." O'Brien seemed unusually
cool, while Fitz was nervous and , bore
an anxious look." He tried the ring sev
eral times, moving about and striking a
fighting' attitude.
FOOTWORK PUZZLIXG.
Fitz was obviously puzzled by the won
derful footwork of O'Brien. . The veteran
tried his best to corner O'Brien In the
first round, but was unable to do so,
missing a number of swings which went
wide of their mark. O'Brien's left be
gan to sting like a wasp in the second
round and Fitz could seldom block its
progress. O'Brien's tactics almosc
throughout the fight were to Jab with
his left, then rush into a clinch. At all
stages of the tight he was the only one
to hang on, Fitz never taking this ad
vantage even when in the direst distress
O'Brien waa peppering Fitz's nose .in
the secondhand the latter ducked into a
hard left to the head. O'Brien caught
his opponent off his guard and swung in
a right and left. ' Near the end of the
round they exchanged rights to the head â¢
O'Brien tried to joke Fltz early In the
third round, but after he got a couple of
left rips to the body, he cut out the
funny business and settled down to work
lie staggered Fltz with a left to the face
and got a left to the head in return.
Just as the gong sounded the end of
the round O'Brien caught Fitz a sting
ins left to the jaw which lifted him off
his feet and sent him to the mat on his
haunches with a crash. Fltz rushed at
OBrien at the beginning of the fourth
round, and. missing him, nearly stumbled
out of the ring. O'Brien went at Fitz and
rushed him to the ropes, landing repeat
edly with his left. Fitz cut O'Brien's left
eye near the end of! the round.

:\u25a0: Not : any, more '\u25a0 Graziallo do the talent
at : lngleside ;want for many days. The
odds* -against the Columbia stable's "bay
horse . were .harcmered^ down . from .twos
to 11; to; 10 favoritism ; in the betting done
on the mile ; handicap" yesterday; : and . he
finished next to;- last . position.- ; Walter,
Jennings; nronouriced -him >flt,: and he
splashed | through the slushy going in his
preliminary /as if .-, mud belonged in his
diet.jKnapp had the first choice in front
after; making -the first turn,- and that is
about all that- can be said in his favor.
Neva Lee, with C. Miller up, breezed past
the Easterner turnine down â¢ the back
stretch, and; from Lthere on made a show,
of her field, finishing nearlyfour lengths
in advance of Grecor X at the judges'
stand. ' - San Primo . grabbed show honors
from Lubin by a neck.
Two favorites only registered first, and
the ring must have had an inningf The
attendance: was eood.-.
"Big ; Bill. Knapp landed the opening

have ' Dr. Rowell's . gelding beaten once,
but he outstayed the Major, winning han
dily*, by more: than a length. The show
went to Waterspout; a 16 to 1 chance, v
\u0084 Grasscutter, figured one of the real ripe
mellow, spots* on the card, and a l-to-2
choice for the two-year-old scramble, fin
ished absolutely last. : The filly, met with
sharp interference on the back stretch
and would not: extend herself thereafter.
The winner turned up in; Pentagon, * a
long shot, \whiclv nosed Succeed out. for

close third. .v ; - .
Barney Schreiber's" filly Angleta, more
.because.- of.' having Radtke in the saddle
than anything else, went to the post
favorite' over Ed Lilburn for the third
event. , The' first choice began fading
away< after striking the stretch in front
and in an extended drive lost to Lilburn
by.'half .a length. Dod Anderson led Ocy
roheoourt r for ! .the . show. ' McÃride rode
the winner with excellent judgment.
-Bountiful, at son of Lucky Dog, made
himself right \u25a0at-home in .the 'sloppy-go
ing by disposing .of a fair . bunch :.; of
sprinters 1 in* the second three-quarter. mile
run;.'A4Vi-to-l chance, Radtke had the
gelding in the lead from, the .start, and
at -the wire: downed"' the' favorite," "Matt

People Think Uncle
Sam Wants the
Island.
Mariposa Brings Big
Cargo From
Papeete.
. The Oceanic Steamship Company's liner
Maripcsa. Captain R. T. Lawless, arrived
ii jrastera&y from Tahiti with twenty-six
t ussengers and more than 2000 tons of
cargo. The cargo was made up of trop
ical products and included 15.917 sacks of
copra, ril& sacks of cocoanuts, 42,000 co
coanuts in husk, ICS cases of alligator
pears, tropical fruit, mother-of-pearl,
vanilla beans and other South Sea prod
ucts.
. Mrs. It. T. Lawless, wife of tire Mari
posa's commander, made the round trip
on the liner. Mrs. Arthur Cornwall, who
loft here on the MaripoEa, is staying over
a trip to enjoy the midwinter beauties
of the South Sea island. : , ! ,
Among the Mariposa's passengers was
E. Levy, a pearl dealer, and W. H. Rob
inson, the company's agent at Papeete.
The Mariposa brings word of serious
injury sustained In a runaway by Mrs.
Hurbin, wife of the commander of the
French g-ur.boat Telee, stationed at Pa
peete. Mrs. Howard was a passenger
" from here on the Mariposa. Lieutenant
Hurbin has been stationed In the South
Stas for twenty months, and Mrs. Hur
fcin, desiring to .pass Christmas with her
husband, left their three children in care
of a relative in France, journeyed out
here, and on the Mariposa sailed for
Tahiti.
The day after her arrival her husband
took her for a drive. The horses ran
away. The rig was smashed to pieces.
Lieutenant * Hurbin escaped, with a
sprained ankle, but his wife received ex
tensive and painful injuries. Her face
was badly lacerated, a number of her
front teeth were knocked out and she was
thought to have sustained internal, in
â¢juries. Mrs. Hurbin was a beautiful
woman, of great personal charm. She
won the regard of her fellow passengers
on the Mariposa and the news of her
disastrous ride was received with deep
regret.
All over Tahiti, say tha passengers,
there is being discussed a rumor to the
*ffect that Uncle Sam lias offered France
10.000.000 francs for the island. With the
opening of the Panama canal Papeete
will occupy the same relation to Poly
nesia that Honolulu now holds to the
Orient, and on this account, say the
islanders, the American Government is
anxious to own the island. Tahiti's com
mercial importance is gTowlng and
France la said to be getting tired of
managing the colony. Tahiti has some
of the finest harbors in the world and
Is one of the earth's fairest and most
fruitful lands, y\ J

posa were:

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Wall-street Stocks active and sensitive. Cotton lower.
m â¢ Local Stock trading of a holiday character.
\- Wheat, Barley and other Grains generally quiet.
\u25a0 'ftay, Beans 'and Feedstuff s about as before.
â¢^ Fresh Fruits and Vegetables in sufficient supply.
' Poultry shores little change. Game higher.
"Potato and Onion markets well supplied.
Butler, Cheese and Eggs unchanged.
\ t Prunes still tending upward in New York.
Cattle, Sluep and Hogs unchanged.
The Public and Stock*.
J. S. Cache & Co. cf Xc-w-Tork say:
. "Tl>e attitude of the public Is decidedly
,rjÂ«.\ There is none of the wild clamoring
f^^ stocks that characterized the advance In
â¢Â«m nor is the public in the market, iren;ral
,. â¢>" speaking. At the same time there is a
large public interest and it is probably in
j creasing, but its operations ar* by no means
As .cne-*idÂ«-d as was formerly thÂ« case. It is
not uncommon now to find a semi-speculator
or former years playing the short side for a
turn. Even on the long side cf the market
the public attitude is .different. Loans
chow but little -change from day to day
Jn comparison with the magnitude of opera
lions or cf the advance-.-. This demonstrates
c tendency to trade, to take *mall profits
and ttnall losses. H may be due to a tevl
injt of apprehension in regard to the situa
tion, or, as is more prcbeMe, it may be due
to the education of the public.
"The bulls apparently are still In full con
trol of the situation, and advance stocks al
most et will. During the past few days a
heavy profit-taking movement has been in
evlo^nee. This bejjan a week ago, but its
effect did not become noticeable until the
past few days. Coupied with these realizing
eal<-s was th-e inevitable short, selllnc move
ment by the trader*., who *old stocks as
feelers to test the strength of the bull ac
count.
"The Russian situation has had little ef
fect locally, as Russian bonds have remained
fir-m fn the race of extending agrarian and
political troubles. It seems improbable that
anything short of a financial crash abroad will
have much Influence on our market. Money
rate* have eased oft materially and Jiave
. probably seen their highest figures for a year
to come. There may be a temporary harden
ing of rates at the end of the month in prep
aration for Interest and dividend dlsburse
cn-nts. but money should be easier abroad
fciter the first of the year, when the annual
. \u25a0window dressing by the foreign banks is
over. The situation shows little change, and
elUwugh the present upward movement may
continue well into the new year. It is well
to remember that & market of this kind la
Bat all one way. In ISOI the fluctuations
7*jt-e violent and frequent. Many stocks are
. rJ^; sslUng above their present or prospective
Â»jÂ»:ue, but in & bull market stocks advance
Â«.oore the dreams" of the optimist Just as in &
bear market they fall much below their ac
tual worth."
The Coffee Trade.
Tbe New York circular of Henry Nord
ling-er & Co. Kaj-s:
"Our last report was dated November 15.
The market has remained virtually unchanged
since then, although the position of coffee hÂ«s
Â»iiuwn a pert^-ptible improvement, especially
i:i the sharp falling off of the receipts at
Brazilian shipping ports. The Import cost
oi commercial grade* Is ruling at about Vi@%c
I*f pound above the spot price, which has
been -.the case with very few exceptions
throughout the present season. Nevertneieas
purchases are continually being made in ithe
Brazilian markets. Importers, as a general
rule, tell some future month on our exchange
a* a hedge against these purchases, and owing
â¢ to the fact that the prices on the exchange
. have declined more than the prices of actual
coffee thes* importers have been enabled to
â¢ell their actual coffee at a Droflt. \
." "The demand rrom Inland distributors, which
"at one time, last month was quite general and
J;eÂ«irtfy. *lia's la-Uen^jpfr*, influenced,, we think,
by tbe crratlS movement* of prices oh "our ex-"'
change, but inasmuch as inland distributors
carry very light Ftocks (which --is -verified by
' the majority of our correspondents) the de
mand from these sources is bound to be re
m wed at an early day, probably shortly after
tbe turn of the year. It will then be found,
h never that desirable qualities are not by
any meanÂ« as plentiful aÂ» the country at large
thinks tliem to be.
"The visible eupply of Brazilian coffee in the
Vnited States, including what in afloat to
this country, is now about 4.500.0U0 barrs.
'iT.jk consumption of Brazilian coffee In the
t'nited States cen safely be calculated for
the remainder of the crop year to exceed
2. 000.000 bags, which premises to bring about
c considerable reduction In the existing stocks
. fcere. even if it 1* found necessary to Import
I\u25a0. additional 1.300,000 bars of commercial
grades.
â¢"Hie receipts at Rio and Santos show a
considerable falling off during the first half
ot this month in line with the expectations
Â£^f :,ior.e>. who were figuring on a 10,000,000-
HK- croD. ' " .'j:
"With xeference to the growing crop In
Brazil, we can only report that the flowering
la the Slate cf Sao Paulo was very favorable,
end In the Rio producing States good; there-
Tore a larger crop should be expected of

Tillable estimates with regard to the size of
thÂ«* 1906-7 crop cannot yet be riven, and if
9r>mt houses will nevertheless venture guesses
tfcece should not be accepted at their face
vsiue. The past has conclusively proven that
crop estimates made during November or De
crr.ber d? the growing crop year are always
trillions of bags away from the actual result.
V.'c referred 10 this subject in detail In our
r<*l>ort of the Ist of December, last year, when
crop estimates of 14.000,000 bags for the 1905-6
crop -were current. Now that it 1b apparent
that this crop will only produce about 10.000.
(\u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 baps It lÂ» plain that no value can be

Xtw York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 20.â The trading was
light during the early call. On the announce
ment of the report by tbe census ' bureau there
was a rush to sell, with the bears aggressive.
Tho report of cotton ginned to . December 13;
from the last season's, growth,' is 9,282,000
bales of standard size. ' This compares , with
11,971,477 bales' ginned- to the same time in
the 14,000,000-bale crop year lof : last season
and 8,525,000 to the same date In 1903, when
the crop was 10,000,000 bales, and 8,945,000
in 1902, when the crop was : 10,700,000 baleÃ.
Tho amount is 317,000 . balea larger than the
total estimated in yeÂ«terday's report of i the
National Ginners' Association; which esti
mated the crop , to-day at 9,078,860 bales of
the ; running size. . Various '\u25a0 constructions ' can
be placed on the . flgurea of to-day's : report.
They make a bearish . showing *as \u25a0 compared
with the short crop In the years of 1903 and
1902. ' but \u25a0 this crop will show .... to. have been
I picked and ginned much i more rapidly I than
those In recent -years mentioned above, there
fore the comparison is not -' a safe guide *aa

. "We have to report ' somewhat heavier ar
rivals of Hay during, the week ending to-day,
the- total .amounting to 2550 tons, in compari
son with 2530 for. the wet k preceding. In all
probability shipments of Hay ; from now on will
be . comparatively heavy, for -we arei beginning
to see evidences of an Improved .- condition In
the car situation and the railroad companies
report that within a short*tlrae~they.'wlli; be
able to supply cars enough to fill -all demands.
- "The good rain which we ' are T now it having
ana Is reported to have extended tails over, the
State comes at a time when greatly >needed
and means much to the producers of Hay. It
will- undoubtedly assure a gocxlly' amount of
green feed later in the winter,- but^ those who
are now feeding baled Hay will have .to con
: tlnue ,to do so for three or four weeks longer.
"General prices show no change and we still
have to â¢ report a dull r town trade and very
1 little doing -in the export line. : \u25a0 The Govern
ment opened bids yesterday fo.r 2300 . tone of
Hay- for shipment to the Philippines, and it Is
certainly to be hoped. that San Francisco will
be awarded a good share of the quantity taken.
As ' yet, . of course, it is 'too 1 early for any
award to have been made.

shipment : from the coast Is as light as It
usually ' is at thla season, buyers who are in
clined to try the market flnS that holders are
In no mood to make concessions In the hope of
Increasing business. On the contrary, the tons
of the coast market is exceedingly firm and
brokers here say they are finding it mere and
more difficult to get orders for the sUes most
wanted filled on. less than a 4c f. o. b. basis
when Santa Clara stock is under considera

"'What tips?" asked the court, evi

"Well, there is the elevator man. the

the house at which I am stopping. All
demand their tips and if they do not

"I will put the case over for a week,"
said Judge Graham, "and in the mean
time I would ask that you prepare a

SEEK FOR ORIGIN
OF EXPLOSION
An Irresponsible Plank Not
the Sole Cause of Fatal
Accident on the' Despatch
At the last day of the investigation
of the explosion of the oil tank tsteamer
Despatch before the United States In
spectors of Hulls and Boilers yesterday
the theory of the owners, master and
chief engineer was knocked into a
cocked hat. Their ingenuous opinion
was that a board falling against the
pressure gauge of one of the tanks and
knocking it out had allowed a stream
of oil to" gush into the fires of the
donkey engine, causing the explosion.
~ But it was shown by the testimony
yesterday at the time of the explosion
the board, which, was being lowered to
bolster up the bulging tanks, had Its
upper end in the hands of Carpenter
James Lamont and its lower end in the
hands of Thomas Connor, assistant car
penter, and that neither man dropped it
till sent scampering out of the .Â«*liip by
the roaring puff of ignited gas and the
following flame.
On the other hand t% was clearly
shown that the ship had been in bad
condition for twelve months, that the
tanks were leaking, that there was oil
in the bilges. Also that in spite of
tbÂ»se facts the dynamos were idle; that
tbsre were no electric lights, and that
aihld leaking oil and explosive vapors
oijen lighrs were being used. It was
In) this ship, inflammable as tinder, ex
plosive as a dynamite cartridge, that
little boys were invited to scrape the
Insides of boilers.
Inspectors Bulger and Bolles con
ducted the examination of witnesses,
questioning them in turn. Carpenter
Jilmes Lamont was the first called. He
tctd of lowering a 12x14 plank, ten
fe;t long, from the top grating into the
lower nreroom. At the bottom his as
sistant, Thomas Connor, was waiting
to' receive the lower end. Lamont
heard Connor say, "Let her come." Al
most at the same time there was a
flash, somebody said "Run!" and every
body scooted- outâ except little Jimmy
Mitchell, who remained and died.
Assistant Carpenter Connor testified
that he was holding the lower end of
the board which Lamont was lowering
to him at the time the flash came. He
was absolutely sure that the board had
not been dropped before the explosion.
This testimony,' with an examination of
thfc gauge showing the nicks claimed
to have been made by the board to be
in the wrong direction for such cause,
about disposed of the board-gauge story
of the inevitable accident.
Edward F. Hough," consulting engi
neer of the Despatch, testified that the
leakage in the tanks had been re
ported by Engineer Srenser and Cap
tain Weber only a few hours before the
explosion. He was. a supporter of the
falling board theory, but had no rea
sons for his belief, except that he
thought the ship well ventilated. He
thought that open lights should not be
used upon oil ships, and Inspector Bul
ger agreed with him, stating that he
had made euch a ruling a year ago.
Inspector Bulger will announce his
report in a few days. .
ABSCONDS WITH FUNDS OF â¢
UNION THAT TRUSTED HI3I
Warrant In Insued for the Arrest of
f Robert D. Holland on Com
plaint ot President.
D. G. Haggerty, president of. Golden
Gate Lodge No. 1, Junior Order Inter
national Association of Machinists, ob
tained a warrant . from Police ;. Judge
Mogan yesterday for the arrest of Rob
ert D. Holland, treasurer of the lodge,
on a charge of felony embezzlement.
Haggeify said he was authorized by the
lodge at a meeting on Tuesday night
and also by the Pacific Surety Company
that furnished bonds . for Holland to
prosecute him. . \u25a0
On December 12 Holland was In
structed to draw $250 from the Hibernia
Bank and deposit the' amount in the
Western National Bank. He drew the
money out of. the Hibernia Bank, but
that was the last seen or heard of him.
Holland failed to attend the meeting on
Tuesday night , and. Investigation .'dis

EXAMINE DAVIS
HOUSEKEEPER
Bessie Lairance Occupies
.Stand All Day in the
; Now Will Contest
\u25a0Samuel; Davis' housekeeper, Bessie La-
f ranc?, r was ' the second witness placed
en th* stand by the proponents of the co
didr of . the! will of the dead ; millionaire.
Her /* 'testimony began early yesterday
morning and the attorneys just finished
their questioning of her by the time set
for closing.
Bessie . La_france was a moderately
strong witness for those who claim : thaf
the codicil to the will is genuine and not
a forgery. She testified that she was fin
the office of Samuel Davis on March 17
and saw him writing on a piece ' of paper
with a small lead pencil. She told of'see
ing in' the room James Kane, old
friend of the dead man, who was on the
stand yesterday, and corroborated much
of his testimony. She also sald;that
once when she had told. Davis, that /she
intended starting a bank account he _ told
her to put her ironey in the German
Bank, where he saM he had an account of
$3000, adding that s6me day he would add
this to her accourit. She. was left $2000
in the codicil. . i
Asked on cross-examination how she
knew that it was Son March 17 that she
saw Davis writing; she replied that she
remembered the date because of an ac
cident that had happened to the dog Dick
on the same date some years before.
She said that Davis had reminded her
of the fact in . the morning. She also
swore that it' was Saturday and remem
bered that fact because of the receipt
of some ducks. The attorneys cross-ex
amining showed that March 17, 1904, was
on a Thursday.
j Mrs. Laf ranee gave an interesting ac
count of the dead millionaire. She told
haw she went to .', keep house for him
on\ California , street, how he was care-"
f uf to a r painful degree, how he would
pick up sticks on the street to save wood,
how he . would save' bits of food for a
future meal, how he kept strings ;and
buttons and how he would carry home
old barrels for f uel. She told of his
weakening crindition-toward the end of
his life, although she maintained that his
mind was perfectly clear at all times.
She said that Davis asked her how to
spell her name a few weeks before he
was taken to the. hospital. The pro
ponents point to . this : ; as a significant
fact tending to show ;.: that Davisr really
wrote the codicil.

\ Gay -young Ralph W. McCormick ,. and

members '.. of , Alameda's exclusive so
ciety set, are the " co-respondents named
by,; Samuel >- B. / Pauson in his suit
for .divorce ,from Mrs. Emma Pau
son. ; and the whole story is out. With
unusual energj' both Pauson, who is head
of the clothine firm at i Kearny and But
ter streets, and his attorney, Walter Un
forth,' struggled to keep the allegations
of 'the divorce complaint secret./ They
secured an ; order of court sealing; the
pleadings and /lapsed into silence when
questioned as to the cause of the marital
discord in the rich merchant's home.-; \l
"' But the law requires that in order, that
a defendant "may mako proper ; def ense s a
true * copy of the complaint V ;; must be
served, and. in this way Mrs. Pauson was
informed of ' all of the : ; details of ;,the
charges against her. The law, also Â«^-ant-.
Ed to Mrs. Pauson the- right tto make
either " general or speciflo : denial to the
charges against her. She chose the lat
ter method, and in her answer filed yes
terday she says: .
Now comes the defendant and generally and
specifically denies all of the allegations of
plaintiffs complaint. She denies, as alleged
by tha plaintiff that during the year 1905 she
waÂ» Eullty of illicit relations with Ralph W.
McCormlck at', the home of plaintiff .and de
fendant in Alameda. She further denies that
she was guilty of Improper conduct with Wal
\u25a0ttr. Muller at the home of plaintiff and de
fendant â¢in Alameda County, -and further -de
nies . that she waa guilty of improper I conduct
with . him, as ; alleged by ' the plaintiff, at the
Hotel Majestic . in San Francisco. ; \u25a0 :
WRITES TO MULLER
Her answer continues:
This defendant admits, however, that ehe
did correspond with Walter Muller, as alleged
by the Dlalntlff, but denies that such corre
spondence was couched In endearing: terms,
but on the; contrary' alleges' that such corre- (
spondence : was ' only friendly and in no way
inconsistent with her wifely relations toward
the Â©lalntlfT. . ...
At one > time the plaintiff Insisted ' on charg
ing thia defendant with improper conduct. The
defendant was ' HI at the time and because
of her condition of health begged the plaintiff
to postpone the discussion until such time as
she was feeling better. Thereupon he flew into
a race , and applied vile epithets to â¢ her. At
that time this defendant. In a burst of pettf
lance and without ' meaning what she - said,
which -the plaintiff must have well understood,
told him she did not care \u25a0 for him. ; v
In conclusion* Mrs. Pauson asks that her
husband's prayer for a divorce be denied,
as: well as his petition -for -the custody, of
their little daughter, Arllne, which. Mrs.
Pauson i asks the court to ; award Ito her.
Mrs. Pauson is represented by Attorney

COLLINS BEGINS
HIS LAST PLEA
Defendant Makes Impas
sioned Appeal to Twelve
Men Sitting in Judgment
McPn^E ALSO SPEAKS
Gase Goes Over Till This
Morning, " When Accused
Will Finish His Argument
.;-; In ; a . courtroom crowded tto the â¢ doors,
with prominent business men. city offi
cials, members of , the^ bar and elegantly
gowned , women with the "courtroom
habit,". George D. Collins entered yester
day, upon the last i argument r that he will
be i allowed to present to . the jury In his
defense in i the present trial. â¢He had not
finished : when I, court adjourned. In the
morning .; Associate Counsel â¢ McPike out
lined the evidence to the jury in a two
hours'talk, andit was not until 2 o'clock
that Collins began ; his impassioned plea
f or : acquittal. %
. For three long: hours, with but one-.ln
termission,', the- defendant pleaded and ar
gued his case V before Judge Lennon and
the ; twelve Jurymen, at ' times using the
brilliant * oratory of which he \is master,
and .with so consummate a dramatic skill
that the crowded j courtroom was still as
death.' From -the flights .of oratory the
defendant dropped into the â¢ familiar and
confidential tones of an adviser presenting
a plausible argument. It was not until
nearly 6:30 that he turned, to the court,
and in a hoarse .voice requested an- ad
journment, . promising .to finish at 11
o'clock this ; mornlnsr. . . -
COLLINS' -APPEAL.
Every feature of the case up to the time
of the defendant's s flight to Canada was
touched upon, argued and given some Bort
of explanation. Mingled with the praise
of .hia own alleged large-heartedness, in
a&sisting the Newman family, were fierce,
bitter | tirades against j the so-called con
spirators that he says . are trying to rail
road him ;to -prison; vituperation - against
opposing counsel, insults and humiliation
for the women of the Newman family,
and particularly, bitter denunciation \u25a0of
the press of San- Francisco and all its
workers.
Collins opened his last plea with an at
tack upon Charlotta - Newman and the
others members of her family for what he
termed'- the v vindictiveness with which
they are pursuing him to his ruin. He de
clared that the -man never,' lived who j did
more for others than he for. the Newman
family. He referred -: to Charlotta" as a
misguided wretch and a; tool in the hands
of the conspirators. He saidin partr
.This bestial . relation they . are \u25a0 claiming was
lived for a period, of twelve years : without a
complaint from Charlotta - Newman's lips in
condemnation. \. Now ehe - comes . before -.you
pleading In her infamy, 1 , before you through tha
District Attorney , and the hired agent of this
dastardly conspiracy â¢ to believe in what she
says.
Collins here launched . into a general
and. frantic vituperation of the opposing
counsel, and charged them with persecut
ing him In every conceivable way. 'l, He
criticized the prosecution for attacking
the defense on the ground that the wit
nesses are dead. ,He said, "They . ask

â¢Where are the witnesses?' and when we
say, *In the grave,' they sneer." He con
tinued:
But tha testimony stands corroborated. ' It
stands corroborated and supported by surround
ing circumstances that cannot lie and speak in
clarion tones tho - words first uttered -by the
defense, "not guilty."
\ SAYS WITNESSES LIE.
. You saw Florence Newman upon the stand,
and she- said she wished to do everything in
tier power to damn 'the defendant. Her testi
mony was prepared bef ora she took the stand.
She admits It. How can she testify to thÂ»
facts eho did, being then but a romping girl
of nine? â¢ " .
This Newman brood, this arrant brood, sat
at the defendant's table, occupied his home and
were - satisfied because they were clothed,
housed and fed. So long as that condition of
things existed, so loner they were satisfied.
.When . they felt tho support was to be with
drawn they became enemies and determined
that where they could not rule they would ruin.
I need every strength to defend myself from
an attack that means for me life or death. I
must uee every force to save myself and vindi
cate those who look to me for vindication.
After the short recess allowed by Judge
Lennon, Collins resumed his final argu-'
ment.v With the church marriage, memo
randum! in hand, he argued that the sim
ilarity of the testimony of the physicians
indicated that their words had beeli
placed in .their mouths by ;< the prosecu
tion. â¢ . IHiitf'iOrllP?*
Collins then Jumped to the Interpreta
tion of the letter of .' Charlotta; written
to him at Victoria, when she signed her
self; "Yours respectfully, Charlotta,"' and
demonstrated that such a letter was not
written by a wronged wife to a guilty
husband. . -fj 1 "
Mcl'IKE TALKS LAtO- \u25a0
Attorney UcPike's address tÂ«g|hÂ© jury
was more of an appeal to the fjad than
to tho heart. He referred' but^brlefly
to the pathetic sides of the case- and, dealt
exclusively with evidence and law points.
He said in part:
' â¢ The lssuo of marriage or no marriage shall
bo tried In the . court in -which tho \u25a0 issue was
raised;: but the . plaintiff In the case resolved to
go to . the criminal courts to ask the District
Attorney to aid him in the prosecution of the
defendant. If . this . were ' dona In ail cases In
the courts there -would not be District Attor
neys enough in California to try all the cases.
Would it not \u25a0 have ' been more seemly If the
complainants In this ; case . had waited until
Judge Graham had determined whether or not
there. was a marriage? \u25a0. \u25a0
..' You are to decide whether. or rot George D.
Collins waa Joined to Agnes " Newman Jn ISS9,
or whether or not he was married to Charlotta
Newman by a ceremonial marriage.
McPiko then reviewed the early history
of thÂ« affection that sprang up between
the defendant and the young, girl. He ex
plained the necessity . for a contract mar
riage, by saying! that it was necessary for
Agnes to fulfill, her obligations to, the
family and at the same time to enable
Collins to give her all the aid a husband
should sive a wife.
"The attorney. asked the jury to believe
the story of Collins and' to- thus legitima
tize \u25a0 the ~i children, ; for they are," he â¢ de
clared," the children of Agnes and George
D. '- Collins. He â¢ referred ( to - Charlotta aa
one who crawled like a serpent Into / the
courtroom to sting. the accused. McPlke
bade ' the Jury think \u25a0 or the > low origin
and < condition â¢of ' Charlotta . and of ' Col
lins'. attempt to reclaim her., : He de
clared that; Collins upheld- the home,
while the! prosecution .would tear it down.
