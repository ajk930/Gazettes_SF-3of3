her son entered the building and' were
taken- on, an" -elevator to the sixth floor.
They were admitted to the private of

of offices on" that- floor. Joline Is' Mr.
â¢Carnegie's 'counsel. ' .

room was - open : and another room
across the passageway could be seen.
In this room were Mrs. Chadwick. twt
other women and two men. -With the
exception of one woman all were seated
around a . table, apparently in consul
tation. This woman was lying on a
lounge and appeared to be crying:- ShÂ«

iaj^lhjx. i>ec. 1.â Under .the aus

movement was. launched' this after'-'
neon to promote the emigration" of Eng
lish women and children to Canada,
with the idea of supplementing the ef
forts which are being made to foster
hnperial sentiment preparatory to im
perial unity. The. initial plans are
concerned entirely 'with the practical
welfare' of the prospective, emigrants.
Positions will be found for them and
centers of association will be estab
lished, where, their common interests
may be discussed. .It is believed these
emigrants, well distributed throughout
Canada, will help to diffuse affection
for the motherland and to deepen the
determination of the colonials to resist
Americanization.

from the Dominion, where she investi
gated the condition of children who
have -aJready emigrated, in Miss Mc-

opporunltlte for women and children
to' lead active, healthy and useful lives.

John P. Marshall and J. F. Sherman
were the handwriting experts who tes
tifietl. Their testimony is to the effect
that' the signature of Thomas Wilkins
â¢and .Joseph Wilson were written by
Horace G. McKinley, that the body of
the relinquishment of the George A.
Howe lands- was written by McKinley
and that Miss Mary Ware and H. G.
McKinley between them forged the

purporting to 'be that of James Wake
fleld and, if the signature of D.- W.
Tarpley on his bond is a genuine one,"
he wrote the second series of signatures
purporting to be those of Maude Witt.
For Maude Witt, there appears to have
-been two different persons acting as
signers, for, as shown by the enlarged
photographs of this signature, three of
six specimens were written by a dif
ferent hand. The testimony of Expert
Sherman was that it Is very improbable
that the same person wrote both sets. â "
SIGNED FALSE AFFIDAVITS.
â¢ J. A. Wilson, the manager of the
Denlson News Company, testified
concerning the identity of Tom R. W'l
son. the â¢ lame newsboy, who was
claimed, though under a slightly differ
ent initial, by Frank H. Wolgamot-as a
witness in his final affidavits. The ob
ject of this testimony was to Drove to
the Jury that a false name had' been
used in .the affidavits. .
Al Jacobs of Springfield testified. that
he had been mistaken in the Integrity
of Special Agent C: E. Loomls and had
signed false affidavits at his suggestion,
thinking them genuine, so he said.
Jacobs told of his having been the pro
prietor of a general merchandise store
at Detroit " three . years ago and more;
He had met Tarple-? five years ago at
Detroit, and about that time had also
made the acquaintance of C. E. Loomls,
a special agent. He had signed affida
vits for the latter.
"Did you know"S. B. Ormsby?"'waa
asked the witness.
MAKES ANOTHER MISTAKE.
"Yes," answered Jacobs. "He came
into the store one day with Dan Tar
pley and asked me if I would sign af
fidavits for the people Iivlng4here I had
known. I made another mistake and
signed a lot of papers I did not know
anything about."
When asked If he had not been aware
that it was a serious thing to make a
false affidavit, Jacobs replied, "Under
those circumstances I thought that I
I was helping Justice. In the way Loomis
and Ormsby got me into it I thought I
was helping thost deserving people get
their lands."
The remainder of the day was con
sumed by the Government's endeavor
to prove that Dr. Frank H. Wolgamot
had lived in Portland continuously for
the past eleven yeans. None of the
witnesses examined was willing to state
lÂ»sitively such had been the case.

TRIES TO KILL
FRANK JAMES
Montana Man Goes Gun
â¢ ning in Butte for the
Former Bank Eobher
Special pier>atch to The Call
BUTTE, Mont., Dec. 1.â Few of the
audience watching the play "The Fatal
Scar" in the Broadway Theater to
night knew that outside, in a hack.
Bitting with a cocked revolver in his
hands, was a man thirsting for the life
of Frank James, the main attraction
of the play. If the man. Charles N.
Qalland of Helena, had made an at
tempt to draw a revolver on James no
one can say what the result might have
been.
The hack driver who toqfc Galland to
the theater said he was -accosted by
Galland on the street and asked to have
a drink. Galland . then gave orders to
be driven .to .the Broadway Theater,
after asking where James was playing.
When the theater was reached Galland
aske.d the driverTto go in and get
James, saying he was after his life. The
driver then tipped off the affair to the
police and the arrest followed.
The police investigated, and. after
going back on the stage and warning
James, went to the hack and relieved
Galland of his revolver. Galland had
the weapon at full cock and was hold-
Ing it in both hands.
At the Jail Galland, who was under
the influence of liquor, talked inco
herently of the alleged shooting of his
brother-in-law during the Northfleld
Bank robbery, and insisted he >would
"get" James before he left town.
The police intend to keep Galland un
til James is out of the way in order to
prevent trouble, although no- charge
will be placed against Mm.
When seen at the hotel after the play
James had a revolver in his over
coat pocket and was anxious to have
the situation explained to him. He had
taken a drink at a bar with Galland
during the afternoon, but he did not
know who he was. He said he did
not want to have any trouble, but
would like to be prepared if any man
was looking for him. ' - > â  â 
"Why," said James, '"if he believed
I or any one I had been associated with
killed his brother-in-law, why did he
not get me years ago? Every one'
knows where I have been pitching hay
and plowing for the past twenty years
down In. Missouri, and If he Is Just be
ginning to< think of making holes in me
I think he is a little bit late â don't
you?"

lines. ' â¢ -â¢" ; .
: A. H. Stephens, assistant in the rail
way mail service to Thrall for four
years, hajs been -appointed to succeed
Thrall in the railway mail service and
began his duties as superintendent yes
tprday."- ' ffibjEfl " .1- . '
. This news is of interest to men in the
postal service and to all who have
to doal. with the. -United States mails
in a vast territory. The eighth division
"of -the- United State's service is â¢ the
largest iji tne country under Federal
administration. The railway district
in which Thrall becomes manager for
ttÂ»e Harriman lines is greater than
Ptveral of the Federal districts com- .
bined. â¢ ;
â¢Thrall was first connected with the
United States railway, mall in 18SV
when he went on the road as clerk.
He served on the road until 1891, when
he was made postal inspector. He re
mained ih that capacity until July, 189;?,
and then was made superintendent of
the Pacific division of the railway mail
service.
â¢Stephens became a clerk in the rail
way mail service In 1893. In a little
more than eleven years he has risen to
tiie position of the chief of the eighth
or Pacific division. â¢ He first ran as a
clerk on the road between Ogden and
San Francisco, and remained on that
run until 1S98. In a train wreck on thu
Central Pacific line at Colfax, Placer
County, he was nearly killed. When he
resumed work he was taken into the
office of the railway mail service in this
city one month after Thrall was made
the superintendent of the â¢division.
Since 1898 he has worked his way
through all the various office branches*
of the service. Prior to entering the
railway mail service Stephens was a
newspaper man. connected with papers
in San Jose and San Francisco. He- is
the youngest railway mall division su
perintendent in the United States, be
ing but 2S years old.
Included In the Pacific division of the
railway mail service are 13,000 miles of
railway lines over which the mails are
carried in mail cars and 3000 miles on
which the service is conducted in bag
gage cars in closed pouches. The sea
lines up and down the Pacific Coast of
the United States and between the
States and Alaska and Hawaii are
managed by the superintendent of the
P-xciflc division. To his care are also
entrusted star postal routes that run
under contracts.
Many postal men yesterday extended
their congratulations on his promotion
to Superintendent Stephens. Thrall is
in Chicago, where he will be perma
nently stationed, tnat being the point
from which he can most advantage
ously manage the entire -postal area
included in the Harriman territory.
Thrall Is credited with having dou
bled the number of men employed in
the Pacific division of the United States
railway mail service during his com
paratively brief . period of administra
tion, and the "number of miles over
which mails are carried has also been
nearly doubled in the same time.
He has been repeatedly complimented
by his superior otKcers , in the postal
service. His efficiency has long been
recognized by the Southern Pacific peo
ple, who some months ago planned to
jrive him, the -position; to -.which he has
now been appointed.
The salary, of the superintendent of
the Pacific division of the railway mail
Is $3000 a year. The Harriman lines
will give Thrall more than double that
sum, and* it is rumored that his salary
will be $10,000 a year, with a long- con
tract. ~ ' â â 'â â ',*. " v .

NAVAL STATION
FOR SAN DIEGO
Darling Thinks Government
Will Use Its Property
There for a Coaling Depot
MORE DEYDOCKS NEEDED
Assistant Secretary Will
â  Make Thorough Inspection
of Harbor' at San Pedro
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1.â Assistant
Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Dar
ling will leave Los Angeles to-morrow
morning for a visit to San Pedro, where
he will make a thorough inspection of
the harbor and dock facilities and the
advantages of locating a navy drydock
and coaling station at that port. The
Assistant Secretary and his wife to
night were the. guests of honor at a
public reception held at the directors*
rooms in the Chamber of Commerce.
They will leave fpr New Orleans to
morrow evening.
Speaking of the possibility of coaling
stations on the Southern California
coast, the assistant Secretary said
to-day :
"My inspection along the Pacific
Coast has thus far shown me the im
portance of establishing a coaling sta
tion at San Diego. The Government
owns property there and I feel safe in
saying a coaling station will be estab
lished there. Those interested from a
business and patriotic standpoint urge
a system of drydocks along the Pacific
Coast. There will have to be
more drydocks established. Some
of them undoubtedly will be large.
In the course of time these will be
built. I have inspected the harbors
at Eeattle, Puget Sound; Portland, Or.;
Mare Island, tSan Francisco, Santa
Barbara, <Del Monte and at San Diego.
All of these have shown me it is im
portant to establish a coaling station
further . south on the California coast.
I cannot properly discuss the Los An
geles harbor at San Pedro until after
I have inspected it. It would be im
possible to say what future San Pedro
has as a naval station at this time."
CORONADO'S ATTORNEYS

SAN JOSE, Dec. 1. â Attorneys Wil

ton, about whom sensational charges
of misconduct centered yesterday*
prior to the dismissal of the jury in
the- Coronado murder case, filed a no
tice in the Superior Court to-day that
en December 9 at 10 a. m. they will
move for a dismissal of the charge
against their client. Judge Tuttle yes
terday after dismissing the jury or
dered that the case be set for trial
on January 9
In the notice filed the attorneys al
lege that Coronado has been once on
trial before a competent' jury, which
was dismissed without the consent of
the* defendant. The point will be
raised that as Coronado has been
once in* jeopardy he. cannot be tried
again. Attorney Bowden to-day in an
interview said he had . no doubt
that Coronado. would secure his re
lease because* of the dismissal of the
Jury. V-
Juror Louis S. Cavallaro, who was
so severely condemned, by Judge Tut
tle for associating with the attorneys
for the defense, to-day called at the
County Clerk's office and collected jury
fees, amounting to $14 15 for services

NEW ELECTRIC
ROAD PROJECT
Work on a Line to Connect
San Jose and San Fran
cisco to Be Soon Begun
MATERIAL IS ORDERED
John W. Gates, the Eastern
Millionaire, Is Said to Be
Financing the Scheme
Special Dispatch to The Call
PALO ALTO, Dec. 1.â It was an
nounced to-day that the syndicate that
is promoting the construction of the
Palo Alto and San Jose electric road
has purchased the Santa Clara and San
Jose electric road and also the line from
San Jose to Alum Rock Park. 'The
syndicate intends to extend the line
from Santa Clara north through Palo
Alto to San Mateo. and if satisfactory
connections cannot be made with the
San Mateo line a separate road may be
built from there to San Francisco. /The
surveys have been made and most of
the right of way secured. A franchise
was granted by the City Council of San
Jose Monday night for extensions of the
line in that city. The company has a
franchise on University avenue . and
Waverly street In Palo Alto, and peti
tions for franchises have been made to
the trustees of Mayfleld and Mountain
View. Except through the incorpor
ated towns the line of the road will be
through private property in order that
fast time may be made. '
The project to build this line was in
augurated about a year ago by J. F.
Parkinson of Palo Alto and a short
time ago he succeeded in interesting
John W. Gates, the Eastern millionaire
railroad man, and his associates in the
enterprise. The company has adequate
financial backing. William Dohrmann
and A. T. de Forest, both wealthy men
Who recently located here,' are sup
posed to represent Gates' interests as
they are taking an active part In pro
moting the road. W. F. Hanrahan of
San Francisco has employed for
the past month in securing rights of
way and has met with but little oppo
sition except at Fair Oaks, where the
owners of country estates do not take
kindly to having an electric railway
pass through their property. The ma
terial for the road has been ordered and
it is expected that construction work
will be begun in a few weeks. .'

Believes Spirits Are Haunting Her.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 1. â The belief that
spirits and hellcats are -haunting her
is one of the delusions that led to the
commitment of Mrs. Mary Thomas to
Agnews Insane Asylum to-day. She
had been an Inmate of the Woman's
Relief Corps at Evergreen. Of late
she has been starting fires in her room
and running about with a red hot
poker to clear' the room of spirits.
Mrs. Thomas is 67 years of age and
came to California twenty-seven years
ago from Kansas. Aside from the
matter of spirits she appears to be
perfectly rational.

EpÂ«elal Dispatch to The Call
BAKERSFIELD.- Dec. *.â It waa
stated on the best of authority herÂ» to

is actuated only by motive* friendly to
the independent agency! It being the'
wish of the' big combine that the agen
cy, with which It hopes to do business,
will secure as far as possible, the con
trol of the product of the field. It is
also said that the Standard la ready
and willing to purchase from the agen
cy all the oil it controls at a rate of not
less than 25 cents a barrel, but in order
to do this it must be reasonably certain
that there is no great amount of toosa
oil that can be thrown upon the market
at a price less than what the Standard
is paying the agency. Hence the re
fusal of the Standard to take anymore
spot oil. the idea being to Induce all
the companies riot yet members of the
independent combine to Join and- be-
come a part of the agency. -
The Standard Oil Company will soon
have an idle storage capacity of 8,000.000
barrels In the Kern= River field, a ca
pacity almost equal to the oil it . now
has stored. It wants the oil for these
empty reservoirs, and the only me

Professor* IxTturv on Commercialism.
KTANF.ORD UNIVERSITY. D$c. 1.
''Commercialism In America" was the
subject of two lectures given by Pro
fessor Page and Professor Miiler of
the economical department of the
University of California this morning
before the Stanford students in As
eembly Hall. Both lectures dealt with
both sides of the problem of commer
cialism. The plea of the professors
â was that the way to remedy this evil
â was through the great institutions of
learning in this country, where men of
character should be sent into the
business world with the Idea of up
building their profession. ; ' '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, J904.
VALE THE LOUISIANA
PURCHASE EXPOSITION!
GATES OF THE GREATEST OF
WORLD'S FAIRS CLOSE.- c
Gloom a .Feature of Francis Day
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 1.â The Louisiana
Purchase Exposition has ended. It
passes Into history as probably having
comprised the most representative col
lection of resources. Industries, art,
peoples and customs of the world ever
assembled. From the Inception of a
project to hold an exposition to fitting
ly commemorate the one hundredth an
niversary of the purchase of the Loui
siana Territory until the portals were
thrown open and the world was invited
to enter occupied seven years. The du
ration of the exposition has been seven
months, and during that time nothing
has occurred to throw a dampening ef
fect pn the Interest or to detract from
the exposition in any way. The best
order has been maintained throughout,
and no loss of life has occurred during
the exposition from accidents.
The man probably most prominently
known in connection with the World's
Fair is the president, David R. Francis,
and it was deemed fitting that the final
day should be designated as "Francis
day" in his honor.
"This exposition has been the work of
my life," said President Francis. "It
has consumed my entire time for the
past four years, but every hour bat>
been one of pleasure to me."
The closing exercises were held at the
base of the Louisiana Purchase monu
ment, in the plaza of St. Louis, where
were held seven months ago the exer
cises that formally opened the gates to
the world. On the opening day the vast
assemblage was buoyant in spirit and
filled with a unanimous 'desire to give
expression to grood feeling; to-day de
pression prevailed generally, because
the conclusion was at "hand, and it waÂ»
rather a mournful assemblage that
formed a solid phalanx around the tall
monument and listened to the farewell
addresses. There was cheering, but it
was the cheering of final leave-taking,
and nof the spontaneous outburst of
enthusiasm.
TRIBUTE TO MR. ROOSEVELT.
The principal speeches delivered were
' by Governor Dockery of Missouri and
; President Francis. Mayor Wells spoke
! brlefty and introduced Governor Dock
j ery, whÂ» said In part:
In bidding farewell to the World's Fair I
{ want to pay a tribute to the kindly feeling;
; expressed toward this exposition by the Prefl
, Â«>nt of the' United States. In the execution
| tof this exposition we have been American*
and not partisan*. We have united In doing
everything: possible to contribute toward Its
success and th a President has shown un
qualified Internal throughout.
What lesson do we learn from this World's
Pair? I learned the lesson long: ago that the
United States is tha mightiest power known
to the world to-day. These exhibit palaces
art the incarnation of the mighty forces ol
this great republic. It Is no longer a ques
tion â the United States la a world power â and
I want It to continue an enlarging world,
power. The St. I^ouis Exposition takes a long
I stride toward that control . or the seas of
i which I now warn' the" nation*. We do not
intend to setfd'iour warships, but we do In
tend to send our merchant ships and we will
contest on the seas for the trade of the world.
We are going to whip In commerce, if in no
other way. After this exposition will come a
better-understanding among the nations, -which
I trust will result In peace that Ik universal. â 
The introduction of President Francis
was greeted with an ovation of cheer
ing. When quiet was restored he -said:
The results . of this work cannot be ade
quately measured by the beauty of Its land
scapes, the grace and symmetry of Its bulld-
Inrs. the comprehensiveness of Its exhibits,
the intelligence of Its congresses, the elegance
of its social features, nor by the ineffable
pleasures conferred on Its patrons.' but tlmÂ«
will, be required to- demonstrate that the
thought and the labor and the sacrlflcen that
have entered into It . were not lU-advisedly
bestowed. The compensation will continue ta
Cow for at least a generation to come. Its
influence will be felt and appreciated . in
widening circles as the years go by. It marks
a new epoch In the Intellectual and industrial
advancement of the world and tbe dawn of a
new era In the international relations of gov
ernments and peoples.
It Is a credit for any State to have had
such a gathering within Its borders .and a
glory to any city to have been the scene of
euch an assembling. It has brought all coun
tries closer together and has elevated the
world.
Those who ha\> been engaged In the work
will never cease to look back to it with pride.
All who have shared In the spirit of the un
dertaking have had their views enlightened,
their tastes cultivated and their sympathies
broadened. The millions of visitors who have
entered these gates have, by their presence,
encouraged this band of workers and let us
hope have taken away pleasant recollections
of tbeir experiences. â¢ /
The distinguished guests whom we have
entertained have, by. their words of encourage
ment and manifestations of interest, lightened
our labors and Incited us to renewed efforts.
All who have come have contributed toward
the consummation of an understanding upon
which this outpouring of people at the end of
tlv tapk stamps the approval of the , people
of St. Louis and of Missouri. â¢. . ; .
May this enterprise with which we have
. been connected for nearly peven years past
bring into still closer brotherhood all the
nations and all the peoples who have par
ticipated In it. May It deepen our patriotism.
May it strengthen our love for a benign
Providence that smiles upon us. â - -
SCENES OF CLOSING NIGHT.
After the cheering following Presi
dent Francis' speech 1 had died away
beautiful silver tea services, , as tokens
of esteem from the exposition manage
ment, were given to Francia and Treas
urer William H. Thompson.
Promptly at 4 o'clock all the great ex
hibit palaces,, were closed and visitors
were excluded. In the Palace of Agri
culture onslaughts were made on many
of the exhibits, where the settings were
composed of straw and fragile mate
rials, and for a time general demolition
was threatened, but prompt action in
effecting a general ejectment put a stop
to the threatened turmoil.
As the night drew on throngs concen
trated In the main avenues to view for
the last time the magnificent electric il
lumination. One solid stream of hu-.
;manity swerit through the Pike from
end to end. ,The spirit of revelry was
there. Never since the â¢ opening had
more enllvenment been shown at night
on the grounds. ;
Steadily the white. electric bulbs sil
houetted the exhibit palaces against the
night; periodically the illumination of
the Terrace of States surmounting Fes
tival Hall changed from white to red,
then to ereen and then back to, white.
Over on Agricultural Knoll the: great
floral clock clicked off the" minutes of
the departing pageant,' and in the night
rang out the tone of . the massive , bell
as the midnight hour.waa tolled by the
great clock.' " : :
Instantly a hush seemed to pervade
the entire grrounds. The: glowing elec
tric bill fc? slowly began dimming, the
pulsations of the great engines . that
drove the cascades gradually dl ad down.
The light fadei steadily, diminishing
until but . a faint glow .was ; perceptible.
Suddenly there was darkness, . and : the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition had
passed into the chronicleB of history.
CROWDS STRIP EXHIBITS.
Everything Detachable . Regarded as
Legitimate Plunder.
. v â  â¢ â¢-." " â ' . .' â¢; â â¢' : . 'â 
' BY PAUL EDWARDS. >
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 1.â Battened down so
as to withstand as far as possible any
ordinary storm of humanity, â  Califor
nia's "exhibits ' went ; through i- their last
! day at the World's Fair. All cereal and
fruit exhibits in the Palaces of Agricul
ture and Horticulture were deemed
legitimate prey by the mob, and Cali
fornia was expected to supply the most
plunder. The exhibitors from that State
had put everything of value out of
Bight. Everything detachable that re
mained In view was swept away. .
The oranges and peanuts used in
decorating the pillars of the facade
were stripped off clean as far as hands
could reach. Some of the oranges were
three months old, and the peanuts had
been there ever since the fair opened.
Everything 'in the way of a cereal
throughout the exhibit was snatched.
Well-dressed women struggled for
bunches of dust-covered barley or
wheat; heads of kafflr corn were great
prizes, while a pampas plume was to
be fought for. Hordes of school chil
dren cleaned up what the grown folk
did not deem worth while carrying
away, but that was very little.
Some small Jars of processed vegeta
bles were stolen. The contents may
benefit some doctor financially. One
woman started away from the Califor
nia building with a pillow, and seemed
surprised when made to give it up;
There was an unusual Jam all day
long at the. San Francisco building.
To-morrow the hammers will ring
among the exhibits, and the Califor
nians will race to see who gets home
first. . â¢
Now that the great exposition has
closed its "seven months of gigantic ex
istence and is ready to bow itself be
fore the ax I of the wrecker, all those
who have labored within its gates for
the good of California have a feeling of
pride when they look back upon their
work and contemplate the results It has
produced and will produce. California
has a right to be proud of these repre
sentatives and should be gratified at
what they have wrought: A resume of
the efforts put forth here by the various
representatives of California shows
only that which is creditable and
praiseworthyâshows only, results . that
are pleasing. They have all worked
earnestly and intelligently, and every
section of the Golden State, from the
northern to the southern boundary,
will feel the results and acquire more
population and wealth.
The California State commissioners,
J. A. Filcher and Frank Wiggins, while
they have not gone in for social func
tions, have Installed and maintained
excellent State exhibits in the various
exhibit palaces, which have been in
charge of hard-working employes and
have been inspected and admired by a
large proportion of the millions who
have visited the fair. The California
building, while It has never been the
scene of any brilliant receptions, has
been visited by many thousands of peo
ple of all classes/who have partaken
of punch dispensed* there,-^^ received'lit
erature concerning the State, viewed
stereopticon pictures of all sections of
it- and even eaten their luncheons on
the. porches. All Californians upon reg
istering have been given badges, and
these have been prominent all over the
fair grounds.
Perhaps the greatest advertisement
the State has received here has been
through the collective counties exhibits I
in the Palaces of Agriculture and Hor- |
ticulture. The county representatives I
in charge of these have worked tire-!
lessly and with the utmost harmony, !
and the good done by the handsome I
displays of products, the literature and !
the verbal Information given visitors,
eannot be estimated. It will show in
the future even greater than it Is show
ing now, and its effects may be felt for
years. â¢ j
Besides their work at their exhibits,
the county commissioners have found
time to deliver stereopticon â  lectures
daily at the California building. Seven
of these lectures were given daily, the
county men taking their turnB, up to
November 26. More than 1500 people a I
day heard these lectures and saw the
pictures.
At the San Francisco building the
labors in. behalf of California have been
worthy of the highest praise. Prelim
inary credit must be, given to Charles
P. Wilcomb, custodian of the museum
at Golden Gate Park, who Installed the
handsome exhibit in such a way as to
make the most of it and show It all
off to the best advantage. All who
have seen his work have praised it.
Upon his departure J. W. Erwln be
came the San Francisco commissioner
and his labors in behalf of California'
and its metropolis have brought out
the highest praise and given the com
mittee in charge of the building the'
fullest satisfaction. Erwln has worked
untiringly. Besides attending to the
affairs of the building . and mingling,
with the visitors to give .information,'
he. has delivered; more than 400 stere- :
opticon lectures In the hall, addressing;
while here nearly 75,000 people, all of,
whom were greatly pleased with the^
pictures and the "talks accompanying
them. Nearly 2000 school children,
brought especially by their teachers,'
â¢were among the hearers of these lec- :
, tures. Erwin, by invitation, will lee-,
ture on California at several large
churches in St. liouis while the work
of packing the Ban. Francisco exhibit'
is In progress. ',- V- ',-*â¢.."
As on board the fighting craft the
man behind the guns must not, be for-;
gotten, so In stereopticon lectures the
expert handler of the lantern and slides
must not.be overlooked. Al^WilHams,Â»
who wns especially employed to handle'
the lantern at the San Francisco build
ing 1 , haa done his work' with a smooth-,
ness that haÂ».; been , a" gre/it' factor In.

there. Oeorge Marsh, in charge* of the,
Oriental exhibit, and William Wheat-;
ley, in charge of .t,he redwood art fur-'

sale made by the California Commlsi

prominent men of St. Louis will sample
these wines and the placing of them in
the club will help place them in homes

In a few. days the space occupied by
California's exhibit in the Palace of
Agriculture will present. but a desolate

be torn down by the wreckers, but the
influence of that exhibit will not die
for many years to come.
California's exhibits In the Palaces
of Agriculture and Horticulture have
been the largest and most beautiful In
those buildings and the fair officials
have appreciated them. President
Francis said concerning the exhibits of
the Golden State:
"California has made splendid dls :
plays at the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position and I am sure she will reap
much benefit from them. Her exhib
its of fruits, wines and other products
that show the glories of her soil and
climate have attracted great atten
tions-California can always be counted
on to make exhibits that are worthy
the fair visitor's time, attention and
praise." ; ; '
L.ITTL.E PROFIT IN FAIR.
Expenses of Exposition Eat Up Most
of the Receipts. .
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 1. â While it willÂ»be
impossible to obtain the actual receipts
and expenditures of the Louisiana Pur
chase Exposition Company before the
middle of December, Secretary Wal
ter B. Stevens of the World's Fair
made the following statement to-night:
From reports that have been submitted of
the admissions to the grounds up to " o'clock
lo- night we estimate that the attendance on
"Francis Day' V will be a few thousand in ex
cess of 200,000. and that the attendance for
the exposition period will be in. the neighbor
hood of 18,800,000.
In round numbers the Exposition Company
has expended $22,000,000 eince the inception
of the World's Fair project, and the expendi
tures of the several States and Territories have
reached a total of $9,000,000. The receipts
since the opening ,:ay, April 30, have amounted
to about (10,000,000 consisting of admissions
and concession royalties. In addition to theig
receipts were the funds amounting : to about
$12,000,000. raised by subscription and appro
priation to build the* exposition.
While it is Impossible to state exactly the
financial condition of the Exposition Company
on this, the clostng day. it can be Authorita
tively announced that all debts 'against the
company have been paid with the exception of
a few current accounts, salaries, etc./ and this
it is thought will consume nearly all the sur
plus, so that there will only be a small amount
left for the stockholders.
From the amount of royalties collected by
the Exposition Company it Is estimated that

ELECTRICIANS AT WORK
ON NOVEL ARRANGEMENT
Plan to Have President Set Chimes
In Motion to Announce Opening
of Portland Exposition.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 1. â Electri
cal experts are at work upon an ex
tremely novel arrangement for the
opening ceremonies of the I^ewis and
Clark Fair. The plan is to ring a me
lodious chime of bells by electric
keys from Washington, D. C\, con
nected clear across the continent with
the Government Exhibits Palace in
| the fair grounds.
Arrangements have been made to
! have President Roosevelt set in mo
i tion the machinery of the exposition
by touching a button, but it will go
farther than this. A simple apparatus
will make it possible for the President
to touch a few keys which will set in
motion chimes in towers 300 feet high.
The selection to be played Is "Amer
ica."
As the Government group of build
ings are Isolated upon an island in a
lake covering 400 acres the effect, it
Is thought, will be extremely Impres
sive.

President Dickie Suggests That Meet
ings Be Held in Various Cities
' Along the Coast.
The autumnal'sesslon of the Pacific I
Coast Technical Society opened ' in
the Mechanics' Institute Library
building last night. President George
W. Dickie called the meeting to or
der and commented on the good at
tendance. He made a suggestion,
however, that in the future meetings
of the society, Instead of being held
in San Francisco, as has been the
custom, be held â¢ at different points
along the-. coast from Seattle to San
"Diego. In this way he considered a
livelier interest could be awakened
and- the meeting could be utilized as
a holiday for the San Francisco dele
gates. He suggested Seattle as the
next .meeting-place.
â¢ The only number on the programme
was a paper on â  "Hydro-Electric
Power Development and Transmis
sion in California," prepared by Rob

brother, W. A. Doble. In his 'intro
ductory remarks Mr. Doble said that
in the. beginning: of hydraulic en
gineering much was "borrowed from (
stearrt engineering, but with increased
experience .these features were
dropped, one by one. The result is
that the progress In California has at
tracted the attention of the entire
worl'd. He then gavu a . detailed de
scription of the various plants in the
State, using a. stereoptlcon for illus
trating purposes. .. i-
Sessions will be held this afternoon
at 2 o'clock, and to-night at 8, when

canteen question and protest against
Reed Smoot retaining his seat in the
United States Senate. The resolutions
request that the pending bill for the
admission into the Union of Arizona,
Oklahoma and Indian Territories and
New Mexico should be so amended as
to give a franchise to Â¦women and to
further the organization of temperance
societies as adjuncts to the labor or
ganizations. One of the resolutions, fol
lows:
"We deplore the tendency of modern
writers of fiction to assume that the
bottle and the pipe are necessary ad
juncts of many of their characters and
we recognize the statements of Dr. Car
rathuers, the well-known author, on in
ebriety 'that the use of alcohol Is in
fluencing literature of the day.' "

MANILA, Dec. 1.â Major General
Corbin, military commander of the
Philippines, has appointed a board of
three officers to take into considera
tion details for the administration of
the staff department and their several
divisions, and also to. recommend the
number of officers, necessary to effi

for the betterment: of the service,
seeking a means whereby increased
efficiency may be attained with a pos-

The board will give special consid

ber of depots and garrisons, as well as
to the amount of 'water and land
transportation required. Major GenÂ«
eral Corbin is in favor of giving the
transportation business only to steam

EXPORTATION OF GOLD MAY
FOLLOW BANK'S INQUIRY
San Francisco Institution's Letter Is
Supposed to Indicate Resump
tion of Bullion Shipments.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1.â An inquiry
has been received at the Treasury De
partment from one of . the leading
banks of San Francisco as to the terms
at which gold bars could' be supplied
from the Mint there. This is taken to
mean that gold exports from that city
are. contemplated,^ something which is
very unusual. The gold movement, is
usually in the other direction, Aus
tralian gold coming \ in at San â¢ Fran
cisco in course of settlement of inter
national balances.
Several 'years' ago when' Japan was
putting her â  monetary - reforms Into
operation there were some exports of
gold from San Francisco and it is as
sumed that the contemplated export
to-day is intended. for Japan.
If a man pets rattled there must be
a screw loose somewhere.

PROTECTIVE
TARIFF IS
ESSENTIAL
Attitude of the Eepnblican
Administration on Ques
tion Defined by Vice Presi
dent Elect C. W. Fairbanks
BALANCE OF TEADE
IS IN OUR FAVOR
Roosevelt's Mate Says Party
Will Not Tail to Revise
Schedules if Change Is De
manded by the Conditions
BOSTON, Dec. 1. â Before an audi
ence of more than 3000 persons Vice
President-elect Fairbanks of Indian
apolis defined the attitude of the Re
publican administration on the tariff
question at the annual banquet of the
Home Market Club in Mechanics' Hall
to-night.
Former Congressman Robert T.
Davis of Fall River, president of the
club, as toastmaster, made the opening
address and, in referring to the princi
ple of protective tariff which is fos
tered by the Home Market Club, said
that the leading members of the Na
tional House of Representatives and
Senate would soon confer with the ad
ministration on the subject of tariff re
vision.
"And," he added, "we are willing to
stand by their judgment as to the time
and nature of such revision."
Telegrams of regret at not being able
to be present were received from Pres
ident Roosevelt and Senator Lodge.
President Roosevelt's message follows:
"I. regret extremely that I cannot be
with you. I congratulate you on hav
ing the Vice President-elect as your
guest. I , wish you a most enjoyable
evening."
Vice President-elect Fairbanks in
his j speech said :
The' expansion of our foreign commerce un
der Republican policies and Republican ad
ministration is conclusive evidence of the fact
that the Republican policies are not restricted
as far as foreign trade is concerned. In 1800
our exports of manufactured products to other
countries amounted to only $102,000,000. while
last year they reached the enormous sum oÂ£
$452,CO0,CO0. We have been rapidly Increas
ing our wealth through our foreign commerce.
The balance of trade Is greatly In our favor.
From the beginning of George Washington's
first administration to William McKlnley's first
term the net balance in favor of the United
State* was $3Â£3.000,000; since the beginning
of President McKinley's first term until March.
lÂ»04, the balance in favor of the United States
was upward of $3,600,000,000. It would seem
the part of wisdom to hold fast to those meas
ures and the administration of public affairs
'under which gratifying' and unparalleled re
sults have been accomplished.
While the tariff â  Question is an old one. It
is of .continual and' vital Interest. It must
not be â¢ overthrown or - surrendered either by
ignorance. or prejudice: it must be maintained
by education, by intelligent discussion. < .
â  The- Republican -party has revised tariff
schedules'. In -the- past when revision was es
sential - and It will not hesitate in the future
to subject them to careful scrutiny and altera
tion so that our protective system may be Just
in its operation. Whenever change of schedules
is essential in the public Interest the altera
tion will be made; it" will be made advisedly;
it will be made, not in response to mere sen
timent, but agreeably to sound economic ne
cessity. Any other policy is obviously, unwise
and diRturbing In Its tendency.
The Republican pary adheres to the doctrine
of commercial treaties, reciprocity which tends
to expand our commerce and to develop Amer
ican Industry and Interest of American labor
and American capital. It holds the reciprocity
which is the handmaiden of protection, but
not. to that which Is but another form of
free trade and which Is hostile to the protec
tive r;-Â»tem.
â¢ President McKinley has been quoted by the
enemies of protection as favoring the Demo
cratic system of reciprocity. The text of his
lasf sreat speech gives denial to such preten
sions. His utterances were entirely free from
ambiguity. No one could misunderstand them
who did not desire to do so. He distinctly
favored "sensible trade arrangements which
will not interrupt our home production." We
should take from our customers, said he, "such
of their products as we can use without harm
to our industries and labor." And he further
declared that "If perchance some of our tar
iffs are- no longer needed for revenue and to
encourage and protect Industries at home, why
should they not be . employed to extend and
promote our markets abroad ?".
' It - will be observed that he kept well In
mind the home market and protection to our
Industrie* and labor. There Is In these obser
vations no suggestion of the abandonment by
him of the great policy for which he lived and
wrought . so well.

PETITIOXS FOR RETURN
OF -MONEY PAID IX TAXES
Xnpa Woman â¢ Discovers That Her
Property Has Been for Years â¢
Assessed in- Wrong County.
NAPA, Dec. /I.â A petition was filed
to-day with the* clerk of the Board of
Supervisors by Mrs. Sarah Neuen
schwander and her four minor chil
dren asking that the taxes paid on
land owned by them be refunded.
They own a large tract of land, 1.10
acres of which has just been dis
covered to have been a|sessed for
years i.n'ftoth Napa and Sonoma coun
ties. The taxes have been paid from
1S96 to 1904 in Napa County, but a
recent survey by. the County Surveyor
shows that the 110 acres are really in
Sonoma County. As the owners were
not aware of the assessment being
made in Sonoma County the taxes
have gone delinquent there since 1806.
The petitioners ask that J20&30 thus
illegally collected by Napa County.be
repaid to them or to/Sonoma County.
They will also ask the return of St;ate
tuxes paid. â¢ .
needs no interpretation. ' It PjÂ»Â»"Â»y sl . Knl ?Â£*
that the, people have unabated faith In the
Kreat principles for which the Republican party
has wrought Â«w well. It clearly Indicates
exceptional confidence In the soundness ana
conservatism of Republican administration.
The power committed to us is to be used with
urudence We are -to continue to adhere to
and uphold the great policies which have so
well served us in the past. They are not to
be undermined or. subverted: they* are to be
upheld and maintained - with â¢ wisdom and res

Joseph Loeb to Be Chosen
as Editor in Chief of
the "University Publication
Berkeley Office San .Francisco Call,
. 2148 Center Street, Dec. 1.
Stockholders of the Californian Pub
lishing Company." will meet- to-morrow
afternoon, to choose -a,'=ne.w, editor 'and
business manager of the Daily Califor
nian. : Joseph Loeb is to be made edi
tor-in-chief, and Harry L. Stoddard
will be elected business manager. This
has been announced by those who con
trol a majority of the shades of. stock
in the publishing company."
The recent suspension of Editor-in-
Chief Hale for printing editorials
which, it was alleged, incited the stu
dents to rebel against the orders of
Captain Nance, has made the election
of a successor necessary. The retire
ment of Hale created a sensation, as
he was among the most prominent
seniors in the class of 1905. Hale de
fended himself to the last against the
accusations of the faculty that his edi
torial policy was subversive of disci
pline.
Joseph Loeb is from Los Angeles. JHis
father is a French Consul. Loeb wields
a facile and sarcastic pen, but he was
one of the prominent peacemakers
when the trouble with Captain Nance
was at its height. His control of the
Californian is expected to result in a
conservative publication, such as the
university authorities desire to have is
sued. â¢ ;"i;
Only shareholders in the company are
entitled to vote at the election. There
are 150 shares ot stock outstanding and
150 votes will â be cast. Many proxies
will be used!, however, as some fraterni
ties own as much as thirty shares of
stock, and some individuals hold from
five to ten shares of stock each. All
the stock is owned and controlled by
students of the university, and is profit
able property, as the Californian, filled
with advertisements, pays handsome
dividends.

Lemuel Campbell Weeps as
Police Captain Petersen
Narrates the Confession
GIRL'S MOTHER AYS
Declares She Supplicates
for \ Peace Upon Soul of
Her- Daughter's Murderer
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 1.
With tears coursing down his cheeks
Lemuel D. Campbell, slayer of his. wife,
Laura Cutler Campbell, sat In the Po
lice Court this afternoon and heard a
dramatic recital by Captain of Police
W. â¢ J. Peterseh of the confession that
the young husband made to the police
officer at the City Prison after the ar
rest.
In the course of the narrative which
closed the taking: of testimony at the
preliminary examination for the open
ing day Captain Petersen repeated
Campbell's admissions, how the hus
band had gone s to the Cutler residence
at West Oakland, the home of his wife's
parents, how she had taunted him with
the fact that their divorce was not yet
granted, .how he had rerused to live
with her any more, how he had shot
once and then pursued the fleeing and
wounded woman, sending another bul
let after her, and then, aaid Captain
Petersen: : r . 'â '.;., . .;
"Campbell said: *I tried another
shot, but the pistol was jammed. If it
hadn't 1 should not have been here
now.' " >.i ;, .;
i ."What did you understand him to
mean. by that?" queried Attorney A. L.
Prick, representing CampDell.
"The inference was that Campbell
tried to kill himself," replied Captain
Petersen. .
"I so understand it," interrupted Po
lice Judge Mortimer Smith. .. ... "
"Campbell â¢ further told me," con
tinued Captain Petersen, "that he had
made a movement as if to draw a pis
tol- when he came near Policeman
Ahern, hoping that the officer would
shoot him before the arrest was made.
"He told me also that on two occa
sions his wife had tried to end both of
their lives by turning on the gas in
rooms they were occupying in lodging
houses."
During the hearing this morning Mrs.
Hannah Cutler, mother of the dead
wife, related .that her son-in-law had
gone to their residence, 1362 Eleventh
street, the night of. the shooting, to dis
cuss the possibility, of a reconciliation
with his wife. Mrs. Cutler and Ed
win Cutler, the father, both declared
Campbell, had drawn a pistol in Â« their
presence while he was talking to Mrs.
Campbell. .*' '
The mother 'explained about the con
versation and told how' she and her
husband heard the shot in the hallway,
where the girl had gone when her hus
band startedto leave the house. â â -.'
"But there is no bitterness in my
heart for this poor boy," said the
mother to Prosecuting Attorney A. P.
Leach, who was conducting the exami
nation.. "Do you know I pray every
night for the peace of his soul.' For the
crime he has committed I have the
deepest- heart . burnings, but for the
man, yes, I pray for the man who
murdered my child."
Other witnesses examined were T)r.
R. T. Stratton, Dr. K L. RIggin, E. J.
Carey, Marshal of Emeryville; E. J.

BEL/GRADE, ;"ServIa, Dec. >iâ MM.
Todomovics,_ Davidovics and Polits

The police and Prosecuting Attorney
A. P. Leach are rounding their evi
dence into shape. They feel confident
that they will be able to prove that
Kiniry killed Patrolman Smith. That
their prisoner would kill on sight the
detectives are satisfied from a remark
dropped by him when he said:
"I never took human life before this
affair in Oakland, but since then I
would not -have hesitated an instant to
shaot to kill in case I had been cor
nered."
Kiniry's ratinj? as a bad man con
vinces the police that not a precaution
should be overlooked while he is in
their custody. They feel that he would
not hesitate to commit any crime to
gain his liberty. In self-protection, if
for no other reason, every possible safe
guard has been invoked to prevent
Kiniry's escape. Under his smiling ex
terior ho hides a criminal mind, say the
police, and . a lithe, active physique,
ready to respond to any call of roguÂ«ry.

ca at its meeting in New York has
just honored its president, James J.

some majority for a third term. He
%\as chosen the flrBt time by acclama
tion and on the other occasions when
he ran for . office he received a flatter
ingly large vote-, showing: the great
â¢/onfititEce placed in him by the vast
army of his fellow, workmen.
Mr. Freel has been identified with
linjon labor work for more than thirty
years and his record is an enviable
Ota.- There is scarcely a labor leader in
this- country, Canada or England bet
ter known -or more respected than he.
' Ho has always been- a believer in a
ful settlement of . affairs J>ertain
ing to his- union and hi? work as an
arbitrator has won for him the con
fidence of â¢ bolh employers and em
â¢â¢Â« in nearly every large city of

Arnqng the great strikes settled by
Mr. Freel were the Pittsburg difficulty,
Â¦thÂ»- -.New- York Sun trouble and the
great strike in Chicago some years
As an arbitrator of these difficul
ties, Mr. Freel was brought into the
confidence of the managers and pro
prietors of many big dailies and his
efforts in "behalf of peace did much to
make him the lifelong friend of many
great men.
Â¦Mr.. Freel has never been in this city,
but he has often expressed a longing
to see the Pacific < oast and will prob
ably journey out here soon. He will
be royally received by the local lal>or

CONTRA COSTA
DIRECTORS SUED
Stockholder Charges That
President Dingee Has
Misappropriated $295,000
As a stockholder of the Contra Costa
Water Company, Jeanne D. Center
charges that William J. Dingee, presi
dent of the,- corporation, with the as
sistance of the other directors, has mis
appropriated {295,000 of the company's
funds. By her attorneys, Baggett,
Jones & Sheridan, she yesterday filed
an action for the recovery of that sum
in damages for all of the owners ot
shares.
The basis of the suit is found in a
resolution of the directors of the com
pany on April 7, 1903, â¢ declaring that
questions had arisen as to the validity
of the title of the Contra Costa Com
pany to its realty and many suits were
threatened, therefore $300,000 should be
put aside and placed in Dingee's hands
and expended, all or in part, for the
purchase of adverse titles and the com
promise of prospective litigation. On
the same date another resolution was
adopted approving the report of Presi
dent Dingee that he had already ex
pended $295,000 for the purposes men
tioned.
The plaintiff alleges, on her informa
tion and belief, that no question what
ever had arisen as to the validity of the
titles of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany to any of its realty or other hold
ings and that no suits were ever threat
ened, and she. believes that no part of
the $295,000 was ever paid .out for the
purposes enumerated.
She declares that she demanded of
the ; Secretary of the corporation that
he exhibit vouchers for the- expendi
tures, but he told her that he had none
âthat the only authority for the pay
ment of the money was contained in
the resolution of the directors. For
thirty, days prior^to the beginning of
â¢this action, she saVs. she has demand
ed of the board of directors that they
institute the suit, but the board re
fused. .
The defendants named in the action
besides the company are the directors-
William J. Dingee, Charles C. Bemis,
Thomas H. Pheby. H. G. Stevenson, A.
H. Wlnn and A. W. Rose!. The company
is capitalized at $6,000,000.'

MOVERS AGAINST
LAND RAFFLES
George H. Moore' Causes Ar
rest of J. J. Darrell for
Aiding a Lottery ---Scheme
SAYS HE WON PKOPERTY
Claims He Held the Winning
Ticket, but Could Find
No One to Give Him Deed
J. J. Darrell, who conducts a real es
tate office in the Examiner building,
was arrested yesterday on complaint
of George H. Moore on a charge of
aiding and abetting a lottery. The
charge is a common one, but the case i
against Darrell is based on allegations j
that are far from commonplace and if ;
proved will establish the existence of, j
and at the same time, put to end an- ]
other get-rich-quick scheme.
Moore alleges that Darrell is the lead
er of a number of conspirators that
have been conducting a raffle in which
houses and lots of great value were
supposed to be the prizes, the tickets
for the drawing being numbered to cor
respond with those issued by a lottery
company, the winning of the prize be
ing governed by the lucky number of
the lottery. Moore says that he invest- !
ed in the house and lot scheme and lo!
one morning he. found that he had
"won" a valuable piece of property ota
Eighteenth street.
He forthwith set out to obtain a deed
to the property, but could find n<. one,
he says, that would undertake lie re
sponsibility of executing such an in
strument. Then, he says, he heard that
Darrell was the possessor of $8000 that
had been paid in for tickets on" the
property he had "won," so he made a !
demand for this' sum. in lleii of the j
property. Darrell, he alleges, refused to j
see things in his light and denied in
terest in the property-raflle scheme.
Then Moore went in search of a law
yer. He employed Attorney W. D.
Grady to handle his case. Grady placed
the case before the Attorney General j
and obtained his permission to bring!
suit under the statutes to declare the
property involved, in the raffle forfeited
to the State. Looking farther, Grady
says he found that several other pieces
of land fall . under the forfeit statute
and he will proceed against them also.
A big piece of land near Napa, Grady
says, is now up for raffle smd this will'
come under the law. .
This end of the case provided for,
Grady and his client went in search of
a warrant. After listening to the al
legations a warrant for Darrell's arrest
was issued by Judge Cabaniss and De
tectives O'Dea and Mulcahy took the
accused into custody. He soon regained
his freedom, however, on $500 bail.
George D. Collins acting as his attor
ney. /
Mr. Collins said last evening that his
client had no fear as to the outcome
of the case and that the legitimacy of
the stand taken by Darrell would be
fully established when the ( case came
up for hearing.

EVERY CORNER
HAS ITS "COP"
Large Squad of Police in
Chinese District to Put
an End to All Gambling!
ELLIS' BEAT CHANGED
Subpenas Otit t for Bevy of
Witnesses in the Inquiry
Into Charges of Bribery
In accordance - with : a resolution
passed by the Board of. Police Com
missioners on., Wednesday evening,
twenty-four patrolmen and a sergeant
of police were detailed by Chief Witt
man yesterday in the Chinese district
to suppress gambling. Sergeant . Ellis,
who was in charge of the squad on the
evening that Commissioner Hutton ar
rested the eighty-seven fantan players
at 620 Washington street; was removed
and ordered to -report for, duty at the
Harbor police station. â  â  -.. . .â¢ Â£ â 
Sergeant Jesse B. Cook, who is in
command of the new men and who' will
attempt to close all lottery joints and
gambling clubs in the section, is a man
long feared' by the Chinese. He has
done duty in Chinatown on several oc
casions, and on account of his knowl
edge of the heathen tongue has been
very successful ' in enforcing' the' law.
He is known as the V White Devil." and
has been responsible for the cessation
of several highbinder conflicts in which
many lives were lost. His policy is
one of aggressiveness, which, he
claims, is the only one to be pursued
when dealing with pagans.
Cook and his men relieved Ellis yes
terday afternoon at 3 o'clock. It is the
intention of, the. sergeant to, organize
three watches of eight men each, so
that at all times the gamblers will be
under surveillance. Heretofore there
has been but one watch and the Chi
nese took advantage of the departure
of the officers to open their clubs and
operate without interruption. Cpok
proposes that some of his men will be
on duty at all hours and will oblige all
doors to remain open and all gambling
clubs to remain vacant. .
Last night gambling was at a stand
still and no arrests were made. The
following are the orders from Chief
Wittman:
Sergeant J. B. Cook â Sir: You â  are hereby
assigned to special duty in the Chinese quar
ter In charge of the special squad for the
suppression of all gambling of any nature
whatever In that quarter, relieving Sergeant
Kills and squad.
The officers assigned to duty with you are
G W. Haggett. O. H. Rodlger, E. H. Mills,
W. J Cavanaugh. P. Rellly, J. A. Annear,
R. A. Curtln T. F. Hobi. H. Segulne. T. P.

Collier. M. O'Dowd. F. O. Blermann. E. F.
Copeland. J. W. Wright, J. S. O'Nell, P.
Curry, E. J. McKevltt and J. J. Frederlchs.
They have been Instructed to report to you.
for order* this date.
It will be your duty, and you are hereby
ordered, to use all lawful means to suppress
gambling In the Chinese quarter, and to pay
particular and unceasing attention to such
places as may be frequented by / whites for
that purpose, to the \ end that gambling by
whites with Chinese may be broken up. â '
Instruct the officers assigned to duty under
your command that whenever they find or
euepect the law being violated - they must act
at once and not wait for orders, but arrest
any and all persons violating the laws, espe
cially those ' pertaining j to gambling and lot
teries.
You will keep an accurate account of all ar
rests made by your squad, and the disposition
of the- cases In court, and make reports In de
tail at the end of each month, showing the
police work done by the squad. -
This order to take effect at 3 p. m. this date. â 
GEORGE W. WITTMAN, Chief of Police.
The investigation to be made by the
Police â¢Commissioners into the alleged
bribery in the Chinese quarter will
commence at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
Sergeant Ellis and his men will be
present to give testimony, and those
others, against whom accusation has
been made, claim they will be ready
with rebuttal evidence. Both the pro
prietor and editor of the Bulletin, in
xwhich paper the charges appear, will
be summoned, a subpoena having been
placed in the hands of Captain Duke
for service last night.

MUST EXPLAIN
THEIR DEMANDS
Patrolmen "Berne and Mc-
Gorty Accused of Trying
to "Hold Up" Saloon Men
Another scandal has broken out in
the Police Department, and as a result
two young patrolmen. John B. Berrle
and Cormac McGorty of the park sta
tion must face charges of attempting
to extort money from George B. Mero,
a saloon man at Sutter and Devisadero
streets. Captain of Police Gleason has
preferred charges against the men, and
they will probably be heard by the Po
lice Commissioners at their next meet
ing.
Berrie and McGorty have been de
tailed as special men in civilian dress
for several months. Their downfall
came on November 22. two days before
Thanksgiving, when they entered the
saloon of McDonald & Mero and en
gaged in a turkey raffle. Both men
were lucky and succeeded in winning a
turkey.
Mero was on watch at the time and
he informed the two officers rtiat tbrf
turkeys had not yet arrived, but h<*
would pay them each the sum of Â£2 in
lieu of the birds. The wily patrolmen
saw a change here, and informed Mer>>
that he was running a gambling game
and that he would better pay for pro-
tection or irouDie nugniconie nia wgy;
Mero was Ignorant of the fact, that be
was "running a gambling game." but
was afraid of getting into difficulties
over it. The matter was kept quiet for
several days, but" word finally got to
the ear's of Captain Gleason, and after
an Investigation he decided to 'prefer
charges, against Berrle and McGorty.
The saloon men deny that the police
men received any .money, and the police
officials refuse to talk about the case at
all. The evidence, however, must bÂ«
convincing, for otherwise such a serlova
charge would not have been- entered
against the two men. . '

STOP SLANDERING.
â riTT.H.E election is over. President Roosevelt has received a popular
r I . rnajonty approximating 2,006,000. It was not the result of ex
; *â¢ citement .and partisan enthusiasm, but of deliberation^ If any
electoral result ever represented the sober second' thought of the peo
ple, .this did.. -During 'the campaign attempts were made to turn
his countrymen, against him by the usual means of misrepresentation
arid personal abuse,, but these failed.' The people answered them all
at the polls. Hundreds of thousands of. nominal Democrats voted
for him, and only the survival and revival of sectionalism in the
-South prevented ' him carrying every State in the Union. His ih
<Jprsernent was so : hearty, so cordial and so . expressive of popular
confidence that. the- defeated party has no reason for cherishing any
resentment:/ On the other hand, it has every reason for joining in the
general good I feeling that has followed the great verdict.
â â .:â  'â /:^.This is :quite generally the feeling in fhe North. In the South
.â Governor Varda.rnan.".desires to be recorded as an exception, and
this is cheerfully idone. No one. expects the President to have the

the other- fe.w fire-eaters. Issue has been joined arid concluded.. But
these, rneh do not. even perrnit American respect for the office to
restrain: them. During Mr.. Cleveland's last term he was made the
6bje.ct of savage attack by' Senators of his own party, to whom the
venerable Senator Hoar responded by saying: "Let us respect the
burden that he bears." That is the sentiment of all patriotic citizens.

resented as guilty of violating the law against cruelty to animals, by
turning loose' the Thanksgiving' turkey presented by a gentleman in
Rhode Island to the President, and chasing it around the White

poor bird was exhau.steJd, while the President looked on laughing and
applauding! . .Now the turkey in question was sent already dressed,

her voice. â¢;,'.â¢â /.
"I'll bet those confounded servants
are gossiping down* In the basement.
Ring 'em again, and ring 'em like
thunder."
Central obeyed his orders energet
ically, but without results.
"I can't get any answer," she said
gently to the irate man at the other
end of the line, "but I'll try them again
in a few minutes, and if I get an an
swer I'lL call you up. No, I won't for

had uttered his warning. "I know you

your office." ",U â .;" ..'.
"Thank you," said the man much
mollified, "those servants are so care
less, and my niece, who looks after
the children, is confined to her room by
illness."
Clrcleville's telephone system was
not very complicated. The three girls
who presided in the central office were
hot kept occupied as in a larger city,
because this was a new institution in
the pretty inland city, and subscribers
were not coming in fast enough to sat
isfy the telephone company. Only one
of the girls hailed from Circleville.
The other two were from Chicago, and
it wag Margaret Baxter, one of the Chi
cago girls, who had answered Mr.
Dickson's imperative calls.
For the next few minutes she was
kept busy plugging in and out on her
board. But all the time a queer little
smile hovered about her lips, and a
light, almost tender, shone in her eyes.
"It would be very funny," she said
to herself. "If it should be all straight
ened out by telephone, and I would not
be at all surprised if that is Just what
Jack hoped for." Then she turned sud
denly and rang up 234 J.
A rather thick voice with a distinct
brosue answered this call with a sul
len "Hello," Margaret's face turned
grave, and firm lines showed about her
mouth.
. "Why has no one answered the tele
phone?" she said rather sternly. "I
have been ringing you on and off for
fifteen minutes."
"Sure I've somethin' to do beside
runnin'.up them stairs to answer this
bell. It's a wonder a woman can't eat
her breakfast in peace."
Margaret connected 234 J with 719
M, sighing softly to herself, "Poor
Charley, and his babies at the mercy
of that woman."
The conversation at the wire claimed
her attention. There were reasons why
she felt she had a right to listen.
"Hello, Mary, ia this you?" < â  '
"Yessir."
"How is Master Reginald?"
"Fine, sir."
"What did he eat for his breakfast?"
"A peach, a bowl of rice an' milk and
five cakes."
"Now, Mary, I've told you repeatedly
not to let him have hot cakes."
"Then, sir, you'll have to stay at
home and- keep him from it. It's a
cook I am and no nurse." -
"Well, well," said the man, anxious
ly, as one who realized he was in a
predicament and needed the good will
of every one. "I'm sure while Miss
Ellen Is sick you will look after the
children, and I will not forget it when
I pay you next week."
This bit of diplomacy elicited no re
ply from the other end of the wire.
"Has Miss Bessie gone to school?"
"She has not Sure, the string's off

"Dear, dear." said the man, and a
prodigious sigh seemed to choke his
utterance.
"Is that all, sir?" said the woman
impatiently.
"I guess so," he replied reluctantly,
and hung up his receiver.
At her end of the wire the woman
slammed up the receiver with a crash

angrily. Clump, clump, dump, she
went down the basement stairway to
meet a look of Inquiry on the face of
her husband, gardener and man of all
work for Henry Dickson, president of
the Excelsior Hardware Company.
"Sure, it's the same old thing," she
said snappishly, as she tossed the soap
into the dishpan. "Frettin' his soul

Tim shook his head and marched out
to the stably and Mary turned to face
a shrinking little figure in the door
way.
"I want to sit behind the stove,-
Mary. There's no fire in the library
and I'm cold all over."
"I'll bet the young 'un's goin' to be
sick," said Mary as she made room for
the child on the woodbox behind the
stove. "She'd ought to had on her
warm flannels' last week. Sit there,
dear, whilst I tell you about the fairies
Paddy O'Glyn met on his way to Don
egal fair." . '
The man at the other end of the
line had been leaning back in a chair
staring up at the ceiling. Finally he
called his stenographer and dictated
a letter. It was addressed to. Charles
Dickson. and wound up as follows:
"While you're in Chicago I wish
you would stop in to see your Aunt
Mary Graves. Things rtre not- going
right at the house; I fear Ellen is too
frivolous and fond of society to do
what is entirely right by us and the
children. Your Aunt Mary is a cap
able woman and would pull things to
gether in less than no time."
But even with the letter started on
its way Mr. Dickson felt uneasy. Aunt
Mary was capable, but was she sym
pathetic enough to deal with those
children? He recalled the gentle
ways and the fair face of the dead
daughter-in-law. He wished some
how Aunt Mary would have her hair
about her face and smile once in a
while. But she was better than the
more uncertain element he had dread
edâa stepmother for his beloved
grandchildren.
And all the time Margaret Baxter
sat in front of the switchboard, plug

fore he closed his desk to go home
Mr. Dickson was surprised to catch
her voice with a new almost friendly
accent. , .
"Is this Mr. Dickson?"
"Yes."
"Shall I call Mary and tell her to
have the children come down to meet
you?" â¢
Mr. Dickson lived some distance be
yond the street car terminus and Tim
always drove down in the runabout
I to meet him. _It never struck him as
odd that the telephone girl knew of
his daily habit. Perhaps she lived In
the neighborhood. He answered In a
relieved tone.
"Yes, I'd forgotten to call her."
"And if you didn't call her she
wouldn't remember, would she?"
"No, no," agreed the man, "these
servants are a great trial." Then as
central rang off he murmured to him
self, "There's a girl who will make a
fine business woman some day. I
would not mind having her in my of
fice."
And though hie could never tell just
how it happened, from that time on
it was Central who had the trying
conversation with Mary, until' Miss
Ellen got about; and after that, with
Miss Ellen herself, merely giving him
a condensed report of the conversa
tion. This saved his time, which was
valuable, and it pleased his fancy that
some one appreciated his absorbing
interest in the children.
That was why he had a bouquet of
flowers sent up to the telephone ex
change one day and a box of candy
another. Several times he was tempt
ed to call in person, but he finally de
cided that seeing the girl face to face
might prove a disillusion. Faces and
voices do not always harmonize, and
yet he thought of the great relief it
was to receive messages from central,
instead of irate Mary or butterfly El
len. Ho felt sure that this particular
voice stood for a face fair and wom
anly. Then he would recall a recent
letter from his son: Aunt Mary would
come for â a consideration.
But finally an inspiration tame to
him. Reggie was having a birthday.
Ellen with characteristic heedlessness
had forgotten this important event and I
had arranged to join a house party for '
the very night. But this should not
stand in the* way of a proper observ
ance of the occasion. Reggie should
have a birthday spree and the guest of
honor should be this Central girl, with
whom the two children had held many
little talks cross the wire.
She accepted the invitation sent in
Reggie's name. She rode out in the run
about driven by the suspicious Tim,
who had made unpleasant remarks to
his wife about old fools and pretty
girls. And she finally entered the door
opened by Mr. Dickson himself.
He gave a sigh of relief, which was
drowned in the tumultuous greetings of
the children. She was just what he had
dreamed of, but what he had not dared
to hope for. They had a merry evening,
and when the two children were sitting
down, one on either side of her, to hear
what Reggie described as corking gob
lin stories the sound of a latch key fell
on Mr. DIckson's ear.
He rose uncertainly; so did Margaret
Baxter, and so did the two children.
And that was the scene upon which en
tered Charles Dickson, general repre
sentative for the Excelsior Hardware
Company, just returned from a hard
trip on the road. He looked at hla
father, who flushed. He looked at Mar
garet Baxter, who smiled. He looked at
the two children, who shrieked simul
taneously and made a rush at him.
When he had escaped from their em
braces his father started to make the
necessary introduction, but the young
er man wave<t him aside.
"I have known Margaret for some
time â in fact, long before you knew
her. When the children have finished
their frolic and gone to bed I â well, we
will explain this matter to you."
Mr. Dickson senior looked from hl3
son's dancing eyes to Margaret Bax
ter's flushed face and remarked dryly:
"It won't be necessary; and while
Miss Baxter is finishing that goblin
story you had better telegraph to Aunt
Mary. Tell her she need not^come.
We've changed our minds." (Copy

THE LORDS OF THE LAND SHOULD
TREAT THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE
SEX AS LADIES OF THE LAND
EsDeciallo in Street Cars Where T&eu Usuallu Have
Such a Firm Grip on Their Seats,
Editor The Call: The men in New
York have recently organized a "Sit
Still Club," the members of which
agree to remain seated while women
stand in street cars. Certainly that
club is not necessary In San Fran
cisco, only another instance, however,
wherein San Francisco is more progres
sive than New York. Why should a
man resign his seat to some other
man's mother, wife or sister? He pays
just as much as she does, and has
the right of possession, so why should
he make himself uncomfortable, just
because the street car company does
not provide sufficient seats for all the
passengers? There is certainly no law
compelling a man to assume to himself
the discomforts of standing in order
to permit some woman whom he does
not know to be comfortable. It is the
street car company's fault anyway.
I can Imagine that some men argue
to themselves In the above fashion
while they oling tenaciously to their
seats, and I always feel as Burgess did
about the purple cow, "I'd rather seÂ«
than be onel" When any one has to
argue with his conscience that any rule
of conduct is right or, wrongâ then he
may be pretty sure it is wrong.
On the other hand, when a man meets
by chance an acquaintance of his who
Is about to board the same street car,
he not only provides for her a seat, but
insists on paying her street car fare,
which is some times emoarrassing, to
say the least, where the acquaintance
ship Is only slight. Her company and
her good opinion are worth the fare
to him, and he permits her no voice In
the matter, unless she make herself and
him ridiculous In the eyes of the other
passengers. I do not condemn nor do I
uphold this custom. It is a courtesy
extended by an acquaintance, and
courtesies are becoming much rarer
than In the days before women in such
numbers became wage earners and thus
were* thrown into daily contact with
men. But why should th!3 latter fact
make a difference In the courtesy due
from a man to a 'woman? Would a
man ; excuse a rudeness to his sister,
simply because, through circumstances
which made it necessary, she had be
come a clerk in a downtown store 'or
office?

PAINTER SWAN
WANTS FREEDOM
Owes Former Wife Fortune
in Alimony, but Dislikes
Going , to Prison for It
RAISES A NEW POINT
Divorced Husband Asks to
Eeopen Case Because His
Ex- Wife Has Misbehaved
Although Judge Kerrigan more than
a year ago ordered the arrest of Jabez
S. Swan, the painter, for refusal to
pay his former wife. Hannah Swan,
$360 alimony, the sign artist was at
liberty to wield his brush until yester
day, when he was taken into thÂ«
Sheriff's custody. Through his attor
ney, William H. Schooler, he imme
diately gave notice that he would
move in Judge Hebbard's court at 10
o'clock next Saturday morning for dis
charge from imprisonment. When
Judge Kerrigan made his order on Oc
tober 12, 1903, Swan was five years
and more than $10,000 behind on his
alimony dues to the wife, who got a
divorce from him in October, 1894,
on the ground of cruelty. She only
asked for 1350 on account and says
Sv.-an was able to pay the sum out of
his lucrative painting business. Swan
contended that he was without funds
and made the plea that his second
wife had provided the funds for the
sign shop and owned it, while he was
only her employe. The former Mrs.
Swan intends to press her claim.
This morning Judge Troutt will be
called upon to determine a novel ques
tion arising out of the complexities of
the interlocutory divorce decree law.
On November 5, 1908, Lois Alice Ma
thews was granted an Interlocutory
decree of divorce from William A.
Mathews on the ground of extreme
cruelty and she was awarded $30 a
month alimony and the custody of
their two children. The year has
elapsed and a final decree might have
been entered, but in the meantime the
husband, who is a bookkeeper for the
Santa Fe, has applied for permission
to reopen the case and file an amend
ed answer. His attorney is Samuel M.
Shortridge. He charges now that on
various occasions during the year
I Mrs. Mathews has been unduly inti
mate with one William Knox and
others unnamed. On that account
, Mathews thinks that he is entitled to
: the final decree.
Dora Trugden's third effort to get a
' divorce from Daniel Trugden was suo
] cessful, he having defaulted. Judge
I Troutt granted the decree yesterday.
â¢ Trugden was a schoolboy In one of the
i rural towns and his marriage with
! Dora was a forced one. He at once
deserted the wife. The court allowed
her $20 a month alimony and custody
I of the child.
A divorce was granted by Judge
Graham to Amelia Fox from Fred L.

Value of Six Libelous Words,
Twenty thousand dollars is the es

filed iyesterday are G. Almagia and B.
Palrigi, publishers of another Ital
ian paper and passenger agents for
railroad and steamship companies, do
ing business at 12 Montgomery ave
nue. The six Italian words complain
ed of, rendered Into English, mean
"the newspaper that receives some-:
thing from the Government to act as

phrase signifies that they are , subsi

from a bullet wound Bald to have been
accidentally inflicted at her home in
Black" Diamond, Contra Costa. County,
last Wednesday morning. The woman
was removed to the hospital' on
Wednesday night, escorted by Dr.
Gregory, and a man who represented
that .he, was the patient's husband. She
stated that she was removing a coat
from a bed and that a Colt's revolver
of 41-caliber fell out of one of the
pockets to the floor and was dis
charged, the bullet entering her abdo
men. Deputy Coroner Fennell reported
that he had experienced much difficulty
in obtaining a coherent statement of
the affair. He was informed at the
hospital that Mrs. Pramberg had de
nied that the man who came with her
was her husband. Nobody appeared to
know his name and the patient died
and carried the secret of the case with
her. When Deputy Sheriff Fennell
asked for the bullet that had been ex
tracted from the woman's body he was
informed that Dr. Gregory had taken
it away with him. ".
Two women, one of whom represent
ed herself to be a sister of Mrs. Pram

Coroner McOormick yesterday. This
sister refused to give her name or ad
dress, but said that the man rrho had
taken Mrs. Pramberg .' to the hospital
with Dr. Gregory was not Mr. Pram
berg, but a man whom she knew. She
declined, however, to mention his
name. She said that Mr. Pramberg waÂ«
not at home at the time the accident
occurred, but was at work near Stock
ton. â  â â¢â â¢
Later In the day Sheriff Veala of
Contra Costa County telephoned to the
Coroner that the man who accompa
nied Mrs. Pramberg to St. Luke's Hos
pital was Thomas Rogers, Town Mar
shal of Black Diamond. Rogers is now
under arrest In charge of Sheriff Veale.
Rogers told the Sheriff that he was
lying on the bed in Mrs. Pramberg's
house, while she was seated at a table
near by, writing a letter. In arising
from the bed the revolver fell out of
his pocket and was accidentally dis
charged. â '.'..-â :

JURY TO TRY
MONNIER CASE
Twelve Men Easily Found to
Hear Eeputed Son's Con
test of Winemaker's Will
QUESTIONS HIS EIGHT
Attorney Collins Wants the
Court to Determine Rela
tionship Before the Trial
A jury was drawn In Judge Graham's
court yesterday for the trial of the con
test by George Monnier Jr. of the will
of his reputed father, George Monnier,
a retired winemaker, who left a fortune
of $170,000. The hearing will begin on
Monday morning and will doubtless last
for several days.
Four of the panel were excused by the
contestant's attorneys, Matt Sullivan
and Theodore J. Roche. Tha twelve re
maining were accepted by George D.
Collins, attorney for the proponent,
without examination. The Jurors are:
Philip Ivinzel. 3799 Washington street;
Karl H. Wulbers, 2299 Fifteenth street;
John N. Parkin, 610 Turk street; Ed
ward Loventhal, 403 Sixth street; Frank
T. Hull, 1111 Union street; John F.
Plath, 1401 Steiner street; Maurice
Kahn, 1611 Bush street; Charles D.
Hathaway. 1201 Taylor street; Slgmund
Fischer, 643 Stevenson street; James
Rossiter, 206 Francisco street, and. Ja-
cob R. Leese, 233 Lake street
Monnier Sr. left all of his property
to his wife, Anna, or Hannah Monnier,
to the exclusion of George Monnier Jr.,
whom he mentioned in the testament
as his son. When the young man filed
his contest Mrs. Monnier testified that
ha was not the child of herself or the
deceased. An amended contest was
filed, in which the contestant alleged
ha was tha illegitimate and legally
adopted son of the winemaker, and an
examination of the adoption records
shows tha latter contention to be true,
he having ; been adopted when four
years old under the name of Charles
Dewey. Young Monnier was married
to Violet Henry. In subsequent divorce
proceedings against her the elder Mon
nier testified that George was his son.
Upon this basis of relationship the
contest was forwarded, upon the
ground that Monnier had not executed
the will, that he was of unsound mind
and that he was under the undue Influ
ence of his wife.
Yesterday when the case was called
Attorney George D. Collins moved that
the court first determine the right of
Monnier Jr. to contest the will. Collins
said that young Monnier was not tha
son of the deceased, but an Intruder,
and thought the court had a right to
determine that point without the as
sistance of the Jury. By so doing, said
Mr. Collins, the jury would be saved
the necessity of passing upon a point
foreign to the grounds contesting the
validity of the will. The argument of
Collins and those of Sullivan and Roche
in opposition took up the morning ses
sion of the court. At 2 o'clock Judge
Graham overruled the motion. Then the
jury was called and 3Â£r. Sullivan made
a brief statement of the purpose of the
case.
l>uring the proceedings Mrs. Monnier.
the^widow, occupied a Beat in the rear
of the courtroom, and the contestant,
with his wife and small daughter, sat
near his attorneys. '
A Big Failure.
Baron's two cloak houses closed by
the creditors. The failure involves $35,
000. The fine stock from the Geary
street store will be removed to Market
street. These garments ran from $25 to
$100. They will be sold as low as $10.
Store will be closed until Monday, 10 a.
m., to mark prices down. Wait until
Monday for the greatest bargains ever
heard of in fine cloaks and suits. By
order of the assignee, E. J. Hanson, 762
Market street. â¢

showing, thoroughly disgusting her
tfwner. Garnet Ferguson, who promised
to send her out no more. Lillltus, with

All calculations went amiss over the
â¢result of the mile selling run. The
bookmakers made Ishlana favorite,
and the general public appeared to
take more ofa shine to G. W. Trahern.
"Big Bill" Knapp set all doubt at rest
by -going out In front with the 8 to 1
shot. Red Cross NtrrBe. and was never
"heafled. At the close the chestnut filly
had little left, for Ishlana was right at
â¢her heels; beaten less than a length.

â¢-Dr. Rowell's mare Briers made her
field look. like 30 cents in the mile and
a sixteenth selling number. She was
installed favorite at 4 to 5, but a heavy
play 'Cn West caused her odds
to lengthen out until 7 to 5 could be
had. Naturally a slow beginner, Davis
did not worry about the favorite's
failure to keep up the first part, and in

FIGHTERS AGREE
QUICKLY ON VITAL
MATTER AT ISSUE
Roche an Efficient Referee
Honesty of the New Yorker Has
Never Been Questioned.
Billy Roche, the New Yorker, was
practically decided upon last night at a
conference between "Teddy Murphy, rep
resenting Battling Nelson, and Jimmy
Britt as referee for the meeting of the
lightweight boxers on the 20th inst.
When the men met to discuss this vital
question It took but a few moments to
reach an understanding, although it
was thought there were unsurmount
able barriers to be removed.
Britt opened proceedings . by asking
Murphy, "Will, you accept Eddie Gra
ney as referee for our' fight if. he. will
agree to act?" The latter qualification
was put in as Graney fcad announced
during the day that he would never
again appear as referee of a profes
sional -ring contest. . Murphy replied,
"We will accept Graney if he will act
Will you accept Billy Roche if Graney
stands by his statement . to the effect
that he will not - referee . any . more
fights?'.' Britt replied in the affirmative,
and the matter now stands in that posi
tion.
While Graney has gone 6n record as
not Intending to act as referee â  again,
there is a possibility of his changing
his mind. Should he do so in this in
stance Battling Nelson's wishes will
have to be considered. Nelson thought
Britt could defeat Joe Gans some weeks
since and staked $1400 of hla hard
earned money on his opinion. It is a
matter of history that the decision went
against Britt, and Nelson has never
been able to forget the loss of his
money. He has confided in his friends
that he will never step into a ring to
fight if Eddie Graney is to referee.
When Manager Murphy agreed so
quickly to accept Eddie Graney he had
ANGELS SUFFER
FROM RATTLES
Doc Newton and His Team
mates Let Tigers Score
Thrice in Sixth Round
Ovie Overall had too much velocity,
in that soupbone of his yesterday and
no one knew it better than the. Angels
when they tried to hammer out safe
ones. Doc Newton held a mystic sway
over the Tiger batsmen for a while,
but he became rickety all. of a sudden
and enough bad baseball was crowded
into the sixth inning to allow the
Tigers to shoot three through. Score:
Tacoma 3, Los Angeles L
The cold weather did not keep the
twirlers from slamming the ball over
the plate at locomotive speed all the
time. Hits did not come often and
when they did show but little damage
was the result. Errors figured more
than, the blngles. The Angels all took
a trip skyward in the sixth and never
seemed to recover after that time.
Although it was the first meeting of
the two most showy pitchers in the
league, the crowd seemed to hang back
and little more than a corporal's guard
was on hand to see the big fellows
hook up. The game aroused no enthu
siasm and was marked by an absence
of startling maneuvers, save for Over
all's feat of fanning nine batsmen.
It looked as thougrr the one run the
Angels made in the third would win
the game. One man was down when
old Heine Spies hit to Shay, who threw
the ball away at first. Newton sacri
ficed and while Overall held the ball
Spies started to steal. Ovie was
dreaming about Cincinnati and big
league success and did not observe
Heine's saucy move. After Spies had
anchored at third Hildebrand laid down
a bunt that brought the run in.
Doyle started the doings for the
Tigers with a pop hit to left field. Shay
laid down a bunt and Newton winged
the ball wide to Brashear. Sheehan
advanced both men with a bunt and
Nordyke slipped In a Texas leaguer
back of first. "While Brashear. Flood
and Cravath were offlcing up to the
ball, Doyle and Shay tore through and
Nordyke landed on second. After that
neither team . figured and the game
progressed peacefully. The score:

GROTH TELLS A STRAXGE ;
STORY OF HIS TROUBLE
Imagines He Is Being Pursued by
Members of the Hori-Gori
; -Brotherhood.
William Groth, the ship's cook who
was found on a pile of lumber, at the
foot of Sixth street on Wednesday in
a seml-consicous condition, regained
his senses yesterday at the Emergency
Hospital. He told a queer story of
having belonged ,to a German society
in Chicago twenty years ago known
as the VHori-Gori" brotherhood. He
disagreed with the members- of this
society, and from that day to this its
members : have been following him
from place â¢ to place to % "do him up."
With the object of getting away from
them . he shipped f on a vessel to Ta
hiti i and when ; on ; the ; blue water : one
of the brotherhood approached' .the
captain and requested him to dispose
of - him then and ' there.
_ The man's ,mind is evidently af
fected. He will be subjected- to -an"
examination. ;
I the Impression firmly fixed in his mind
that the latter would not act.
The presence of Roche In the ring
will do much to remove any suspicions
of Jobbery which the public might have
formed. He has refereed a number of
! fights here and has shown an intimate
I knowledge of the game. His honesty
I has never been questioned and the pub
lic has confidence that he will not be a
party to anything Irregular. Graney la
undoubtedly 111, and It Is a question if
he could stand the strain of refereeing
a bout of the character which the forth,
coming one promises to be. .
Britt will settle down to active train
ing to-day at Alameda. He will devote
much time to wrestling with Charley
Kreling, as he feels he will' need a lot
of that practice to make him able to
withstand Nelson's rushing tactics.
The time is rather short for him to get
into condition, but in the past he has
Invariably rounded into form quickly.
He seems to carry some superfluous
weight Just at present and may have
difficulty in working down to the re
quired notch. The efforts of Nelson's
trainers will be chiefly directed toward
keeping him from overdoing matters.
With all Young Corbett's ring expe
j rience he seems to have made a fatal
| mistake after weighing in on Tuesday
I night. He disposed of Beven large
chops, a plate of cranberry sauce, a
pitcher of Ice water and some otner
edibles for his dinner. As he had been
; fairly starving himself for forty-eight
I hours his stomach was in no condition
to digest this food, and he was In dis
tress throughout the evening. His
friends prolonged the proceedings be
fore the fight as long as possible In or
der to give him an opportunity to dl
j gest the food, but to no avail. Eddie
Hanlon made a similar mistake when
i he fought Corbett the second time.
IDEA PLEASES
BERKELEY MEN
Plan to Form Football
league of Western Teams
Broached at University
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Dec. 1.
Information has come to . Manager
Decoto of the varsity football team of a
plan now "maturing in Denver, Colo., to
form a great Western league of college
football teams, of which the University I
of California and the Stanford elevens ,
would be prominent members. The plan j
was suggested by the Immense ehthu- j
siasm displayed in Denver on the occa- j
sion of the game which the University)
of Colorado played with Stanford on
Thanksgiving day.
So remarkable was the attendance
and so great was the Interest shown '
that men prominent in athletics there '
Instantly began to plan the formation I
of a so-called "Big Seven" league of
college football teams, these to include j
the universities of Colorado, Nebraska, i
Iowa. Kansas, Missouri. California and !
Stanford. \ i
. It is proposed by the Denver people,
to form an intercollegiate football asso- I
elation, composed of representative !
teams from the States mentioned, and i
then arrange a schedule to give each;
college in the league a game with the
other colleges prior to Thanksgiving
day. On the latter date of each year !
the two leading teams would play a!
final game for the championship, these !
great annual games to be played sue- 1
cesslvely in Kansas City, Denver and
San Francisco. â¢
On the day after the recent game In I
Denver committees were appointed to !
prepare preliminary plans and commu- I
nicate with the universities proposed to !
be associated in the league. â¢ '
Manager Decoto said to-day: "If the
northern universities of Oregon and
Washington were Included I believe the
plan would be a better one, but as It is,
it strikes me as being an excellent idea.
When I am officially informed of the
measures proposed to be taken by the
promoters we will consider the plan in
detail at a meeting of the executive
committee of the A. S. U. C."
Assistant Manager Leo Bishop spoke
in similar strain, suggesting that the
northern universities be substituted In
such an association as is proposed for
the Iowa and Nebraska universities.

ESCAPE FROM DESTRUCTION
Schooner Springs Bad Leak During Heavy Gale
(captain Christensen and the crew of
tie schc>oner Jennie Wand, which ar
-ivpd yesterday from Grays Harbor,
fead .a . thrilling experience November
17 .\v.hile ofT Coos Bay in a heavy south
caster. The schooner had been buck-
Ir.g gales for five days and under the
strain ot the pitching and tossing her
seams opened. The pumps were
manned as soon as the leak was dis
covered, but the water grained steadily
arid when, a sounding of the well
rimyed seven feet of water in the hold
it was decided that to. save the vessel
part of the cargo would have to be
sacrificed. Jettisoning cargo in a gale
of â¢ wind with angry, seas washing over
the decks and the vessel heeled over
on her. beam ends is no light under
taking. The deck lashings were cut
arid the work cf starting the deckload
oV-erboard wag left to the force of the
peas and the law of gravitj'. As the
lumber lioat'ed away some of it was
picked -up by the attacking waves and
hurled, at the laboring schooner. Heavy
planks were flying among the spray
and it required a cool head and nimble
feet to- dodge- the' dangerous missiles."
â¢One hundred thousand feet of lum
be'r was turned adrift before the Jennie
Wa-nd f hook herself clear of the seas
and began to behave herself as be
comes a schooner that .wants to keep
away .from Davy Jones' locker. The
gales- continued until November 21.
The Jennie Wand v.a,s tiventy-three
days coming from Grays Harbor. She
reached here with 220,000 feet of lum
ber, just two-thirds of the cargo with
vhicli she started from the northern

VOUCHERS ARE
UNDER THE BAN
Major Carringtoifs Papers
Overhauled by Insular
Auditor of Philippines
A LLEGEDDISCKEPANCIES
\ l:
Friends Say He Is Innocent
and Think Clerical Errors
Are Cause of Difficulty
The particulars of the arrest of Major
Frank de L. Carrington at Manila last
October have caused much comment
here in army and club circles. The
charge against Major Carrington is
defrauding the Government by falsify
ing vouchers while in command of a
battalion of Native Scouts at Caloocan.
During the investigation the prosecut
ing attorney offered in evidence five
vouchers for lumber purchased from
the California Manila Lumber Com
pany.
The arrest was the result of a pre
liminary investigation held at the in
stigation of the insular auditor which
was begun on October 14. Early last
spring Major Carrington was allotted
by the Government several thousand
dollars with which to get his provlslon
.al battalion of Philippine scouts' out
fltB for tÂ£eir trip to the St. Louis Ex
position. It is alleged that this money
was not properly expended. The com
plaint filed by the prosecuting attorney
I alleges that vouchers offered in connec
; tion with Major Carrington's accounts
were grossly inconsistent with the
amount of goods really^purchased, and
that in some cases vouchers' signed by
j the major for goods that had never
! been purchased were paid by the in
; sular treasurer; When Major Carring
ton started for St. Louis with his bat
; talion he was "cleared" by the insular
I auditor, and the alleged discrepancies
in his accounts were not discovered un
til he had sailed for tnis port.
The War Department was,communi
cated with and Major Carrington was
ordered to return at once from here
to Manila to explain the irregularities
: He, -however, got a Btay of proceedings
and accompanied his battalion as far as
St. Louis. Here matters were dropped
for a while and it was thought the Gov
ernment had side-tracked the com
plaints. On May 19 Carrington sudden
ly disappeared from camp at St. Louis.
He was found after a diligent search,
sent to this city and sailed from here
for Manila on the transport Sheridan
on June 1.
Major Carrington's financial troubles
began in 1899, when he was stationed
at Vancouver, Wash. At that time he
: was relieved from duty for a time, but
was . afterward reinstated. He then
1 came to San Francisco, where he got
into trouble over "gambling debts. His
friends, headed by William Greer Har
rison, came to his rescue and by sub
scription raised a sufficient amount tp
clear him. Major Carrington's friends
claim that the apparent discrepancies
with<4yhich he is now charged are cleri
cal.errors and they scout' the Idea that
he could be guilty of defrauding the
Government -in the way alleged. The
report that Mrs. Carrington and family
had been living, in* luxurious style in
the Philippines is entirely erroneous.
The .transport Logan pulled into the
stream at noon and steamed down the
bay to Alcatraz Island, where she came
to anchor to await the arrival of a bat
talion of Philippine constabulary,
which is a part of her complement. The
constabulary under command of Ma
jor Haskell, have been at the St. Louis
Exposition and are now on their way
home. The 'Logan will sail early this
morning. V.*:-V
Supervisors Take Up Smoke Xuisance.
The Supervisors* Health Committee
yesterday again heard protests against
the alleged nuisance caused by the
smoke from the chimney of the Sani
tary Reduction Works. A. Sbarboro
told of the efforts being made at the
works â¢ to remedy the matter, a sys
tem having been installed at great ex
pense. The committee took the pro
tests under advisement pending the
results obtained^ from the system of
sprinklers in the flues of the works.
The committee also took under ad
vicement the proposed ordinance pro
viding sanitary regulations for barber
shops. M. Roach, a barber, argued
that any ordinance on the subject
would work a hardship on the trade
and thought the general sanitary laws
were sufficient to cover the points.

LIVELY SESSION
Discussion of Joan of Arc
Incident Brings About an
Exchange of Personalities
PROTEST FROM PREMIER
Dismissal of Professor Who
Defamed French Martyr Is
Cause of Heated Argument
PARIS, DecSllyTo-day's sitting of
the Chamber|OTÂ«DÂ«putles was an ani
mated one, inj'whiclifexchanges of per
sonalities and inveqjtiyes were fre
quent. Thet'discussions were with ref
erence to tm conducttof the Minister
of Public.^ Instruction Aln connection
with professional secretj reports on the
politics of Â£their colleagues and the
Joan of 'Arc incident.'- The former
brought out' a protest /from Premier
Combes against the persistence of the
opposition in bringing up questions
which were settled at the time of Gen
eral Andre from the War portfolio
when the Government promised to
abolish all systems of official espionage.
The motion of censure which had been
introduced was subsequently with
drawn and discussion of the Interpel
lation concerning Joan of Arc pro-
ceeded.
â  Ministerialists who declared that M.
Chauve, Minister of Instructions, had
made a weak concession to the Na
tionalists in removing the professor of
history at the Lycee Condorcet. de
manded protection for Republican edu
cators. M. Chaumlere replied that the
professor unquestionably showed lack
of tact. It was not advisable, he add
ed, to address boys with the same free
dom as adults. The punishment of the
offender, he- said further, wduld re
mind professors of the necessity of re
specting public opinion. The Minister
concluded with an eulogy of Joan of
Arc and promised to maintain the po
litical neutrality of the schools.
The Chamber voted confidence by a
considerable majority, including sev
eral prominent members of the oppo
sition. Many Deputies did not vote.
WOUIiD OOMPEIi PAYMENT
â  M OF TAXES IN COIN OXIiY
Tax Collector Edward J. Smith held
an informal consultation with Super
visors d'Ancona and Payot of the
Finance Committee yesterday relative
to the unfavorable criticism to which
he has been subjected because hÂ«i has
conformed to a practice of the tax
office In vogue for the last twenty-five
years to deposit checks paid by tax
payers with responsible financial In
stitutions in order to have them
cashed. Smith wanted the committee
to direct him in future to compel all
taxpayers to pay coin for taxes in
stead of accepting checks. The com
mittee realized that this would work
a hardship on some 50,000 taxpayers,
who have always paid their taxes by
checks and was disinclined to make
any formal order to discontinue the
practice.
Smith explained that he had se
lected three responsible .financial in
stitutions to act in the nature of
clearing-houses for the redemption of
checks paid for taxes. These checks
were deposited on one day and a
blanket check was executed to the or
der of the City Treasurer, who collect
ed the aggregate amount of coin on
the next day. Smith said that this
wasÂ«purely in the nature of an accom
modation to the taxpayers, but that
rather than be criticized for a cus
tom of the office which he had simply
continued he would compel taxpayers
to pay only with coin in future. The
committee thought the matter shouM
be left to the judgment of the Tax
Collector.

~r~Ti:igir. .'-As.aRalim the sharp gains in special
: i^ocks- there w<-re no well defined â  weak spots,
â +xut'ori!y dullness and. heaviness. There is still
un&bated confidence th&t the tranquillity of the

iy â  expected that sates wtll work somewhat
â¢closer. . St> long as money rates remain easy
there; te"eps nothing that can disturb Bpecu-
# railÂ»-e ;-cniifl<3ence in the present market.. There
jÂ»e*s a- revival -of confidence that the Northern
rs^rijntifs. decision was immediately imminent,
but/kulije uncertainty w^s professed as to what

pett'fd isEueF. Ti;is apparent anomaly is easier
tc-i/nixerrvand jx-hen It Is considered that both

'"pK; "Junior Vanderbllts were conspicuous ex
aiapies of. the claÂ«s to-day. A distinctly de
tected. ,abporx>tiDn -for Investment Â©f thts group
of- etock#- is of greater sentimental effect on
Xfie. .niartot ior- securities than â  almost any
other' act that could be named in the opera
â¢tions of the market. For this reason a con
certed advance in the group is a favorite de
vice of the . .-nju-ket leaders to help along the
rest of the market by ej-tnj)athy. The rapid
xnakper' in which these prices were advanced
: t&-day was sufficient to mark the movement
as suesl clous, .the ' rajlroad Investor, as has
be>n truly obsprred. not following the manner
â¢cf a h&re'aln" counter rush to secure his hold
ings. The rise in Amalgamated Copper was
based 3n i^jmors of an Intended increase in
th<= dlvidcnrt on- one of its . cubsidlary com
panies. . Rallroed earnings reported were gen
erally favorable. The conclueion of the London
â¢ittleniert occasioned a favorable Influence from
that sourc*. Tbe December settlements here
arid the. payments of a twenty million dollar
inM'allTXiPnt on Southern Pacific s.tock induced
c. firmer -tone both for cÂ»ll and- time loans.
"But th'is was not an effective influence in the
etotr. market- The reactionary tendency be
â¢cttp.e fairly jreheral. however, late in the day
ttriC .the closing: was weak and generally below
.le*t r.lfht's level of prices..

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec 1.â At the start the wheat
market was strong. Higher prices at Liver
pool and unexpectedly email receipts In the
Northwest were the factors mainly responsible
for the Initial firmness. > December was ud
%e%c at $1 06%Â©l 08%. and May. %@%c
at $1 09%@l 10. Owing to exceptionally. light
deliveries In December contracts shorts were
active bidders for that option and as offerings
â were hard to find the price quickly advanced
to SI 09. In sympathy May sold up to $1 10%;
Toward the end of the first hour sentiment
gradually â  shifted to the. bear side. With ln
c> eased offerings by pit traders prices eased
off. The weather was still dry throughout
the winter wheat country, as shown by the
weather map, but : Kaneas City sent reports
of some snow flurries In parts of Missouri/
The prospects of moisture in th9 drought
stricken region gave courage to sellers. In
regard to the effect of the dry . weather a
Cincinnati trade paper â  asserted that . the time
had not yet been reached â  for I assuming a
positively pessimistic view and this also helped
tb allay some of the uneasiness of the bears.
Late in the day prices received an additional
setback, as a result of heavy sellng by .North
western houses. At Minneapolis deliveries on
December contracts reached the â  astonishing
figures of 1,000,000 bushels. In consequence
tho December discount , under Â»way In , that
market was confined to 4c : at one , time. The
weakness â  there was 'â¢ reflected In - the â¢â  trading
here. A late cablegram from Argentine stated
that the weather was improving and that alsd
had a weakening Influence on ' the market. At
$1 07% December wheat reached * the lowest
point â¢ of the day. May declined ; t?;$l OO',,. 5
The market closed barely, steady, with De
ctmber at $1 08. May closed on* 1 4@%c'at
$1 O9%01 00%. '
Heavy primary. receipts caused a weakness
In corn. . May closed %c lfijver at 45%c.
In the oats market trading â  was not heavy.
May closed a shade lower at 31% 031% c.'
Heavy receipts of hogs brought out f some
selling of provisions early In the day and
later offerings became more liberal on Intima
tions of a- considerable Increase = In - Â«^>ntract
stocks. An 'easy tone prevailed throughout

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER -2,- 1904.
FIREMEN MUST
IT DISAGREE
Men Wlio Try to Make Tom
Parker Leave Company Are
Shifted by- Commission
Who laughs last laughs best is proved
in the case of the three firemen who
have been trying to drive Hoseman
Tom Parker from Engine 37. By order
of the Fire Commissioners the plotters-
Lieutenant John Devlne, Driver Mau
rice Barrett and Hoseman George La
husen â will be transferred to other
companies by Chief Sullivan. - The
transfers will probably take place to-
day.
The feud in Engine House 37 even ex
tended to the children of the partici
pants. When Parker's children sallied
forth from their home to barter for
bread or milk at the corner grocery they
were assailed by the offspring of other
fire fighters. The sidewalks in the
neighborhood ran with lacteal 1 fluid
spilled by the Parker children in their
flight. w /
These persecutions, Parker says, were
instituted by Devine, JBarrett and La
husen. The Parker children soon be
came inured to running the gauntlet
and black eyes were accepted by them
as part of the day's. trouoles,
The thing that drove him to appeal to
the Commissioners, Parker says, was
not the walloping of his offspring. His
landlord came one day and doubled his
rent. It is said this was at the instiga.-.
tion of his persecutors. That hit Park-
er on a tender spot, and he protested.
Chief Sullivan said last night: "The
three men. Devine. Barrett and Lahus
en. will-be transferred. It is best for
the service that when men in an engine
house quarrel they should be separated.
The three will be assigned to other sta
tions, probably to-day."

LOVE OF MUSIC LEADS
TO PETTY LARCENY
Life in Circus Instills Infatuation
Sound of Pilfered Accordeon Thwarts
John Barron's Daring Attempt.
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
It was an acquired love of music, John
Barron said, that Impelled him to at
tempt petty larceny. His vocation as
second assistant cook for a traveling
circus kept him within earshot of the
brazen harmonies produced every aft
ernoon and evening in the "big top." to
say nothing of the minor melodies
wafted from several smaller tents
wherein freaks of nature were exhibit
ed, and at the close of the season his
soul was so thoroughly, saturated with
yearning for concordant sounds that he
felt as one deprived of sustenance when
the show went into winter quarters at
San Jose and the instrumentalists were
dismissed. He hungered for music as
the opium slave craves for poppy Juice,
and it was to appease his hunger that
he became a habitue of dance halls on
the Barbary Coast of San Francisco.
I He spent his evenings. in those temples
! of Terpsichore absorbing steam beer and
I orchestral strains until his savings were
spent. Femininity shunned him and
bartenders gazed j at him askance, and
then he desperately decided to provide
himself with the means of continuing
i his esthetic dissipation. In other words,
he made up his mind to steal a musical
instrument and learn to play it profi
ciently. That was how he came to be
detected in the act of sneaking out of
a Pacific street dance hall with a banjo
and an accordion unlawfully in his
possession. * .
The owners and operators of the In
struments had accepted an invitation
to partake of liquids at the bar. when
Mr. Barron saw his opportunity and in
stantly, grasped It. With the banjo
clutched by one arm and the accordeon
dangling from one hand he stealthily
crept doorward, and was unperceived
I by any one until the wind instrument
emitted a resonant and prolonged
moan. The bottom side of "the accor
deon had slipped from his hand and its
descent expanded the bellows and ef
fected his undoing. With alacrity the
two musicians pounced upon him, re
covered their property and turned him
over to the mercies of Patrolmen Joy
i and Daggett. Judge Fritz sentenced
him to twenty days' deprivation of op
portunity to indulge his controlling
passion. v. r v
: .*_.". ,'â¢â !â¢â ..-â  â¢ * â ' -^;,i>!
Another victim of an acquired habit
was William J; Haas, whose penchant
for Scripture study led to his arraign
ment before Judge Mogan on the charge
of neglecting to provide for his wife
and five pretty little daughters. Mrs.
Haas testified that she. was "obliged 'to
work to keep her family, from starving
while Mr. Haas sat in .their home on
Germania avenue and perused the Bible
from early morning till. late at night.
He was a lithographer ana could earn
good wages if he desired; to work, she
added, .but neither her implorations nor
jeers could induce him to-do anything
else than concentrate his attention upon
the good book. He; had offered to read
certain chapters \of; Deuteronomy to
1 herself and tha children,. but they pre
ferred more substantial sustenance., v
"Why don't you work and support
your family?" the Judge asked the de
fendant, whose 5 bristling mustache
marred an" otherwise ascetic counten
ance. V . Â£* .'â *
"I cannot obtain employment at my
trade unless I join 1 the .Lithographers'
Union." was the 4 rejoinder, "and con
scientious -scruples â¢forbid ; my ap
proval of unionism either by word or
deed."
"Your conscience seems to be.; in
need of revision,", said the Judge, "else
it would sacrifice all other considera
i tions to the well-being of your wife
and children. Tour scruples .seem to
be foundationed on laziness. As for
; your Bible reading, that Is an excel-
I lent practice if It is not overdone., and
! you undoubtedly are overdoing it. In
deed, if Bible reading were more
popular there would be less use: for
this court, but as a steady occupation
'in your case I cannot commend it."
Mrs. Haas said she did not care
whether her spouse were sent to
prison or out "of the country, as he
was of no practical use toMier and the
children. His fate will be decided to
day.

James Foley's head . was so muti

in a saloon on the water front that he
v/as sent to the Harbor Hospital for
treatment and there his wounds were
considered sufficiently serious to war
rant his detention as a patient. So he
was put to bed and several hours later
he was nabbed in the act of stealing a
gold watch and chain and two $5
coins which Dr. Herzog had placed
under his pillow for safe keeping as
he slept. Judge Fritz committed the
ungrateful Mr. Foley to the Superior

a decent appearing artisan, at 820 Hyde

dwells just around the corner at 1197
Bush street, testified she heard the
children cry with hunger while the
mother was too drunk to feed them.
"She was so intoxicated," Mrs. Hawes
told Judge Mogan, "that she forgot her
baby had ,been weaned." The defend
ant's sherry-imbibing was sworn to by

the husband adding that the woman's
love of liquor was apparently Incurable.
She will be sentenced for,, cruelty to a

similarly charged and convicted. The
father of her two children is in Alaska,
and her second husband aided and

Tomas Perze, a fiery little Mexican,
vehemently asserted that the smashing
of a cuspidor on his head by Miss Alma
Fields, a good looking octoroon, was
unprovoked by him". She had cast se

daily passed her residence in Spanish
town, but he Ignored her, as his troth
was plighted to a lady of his own race
and he was a man pf honor. Piqued
by his rejection of her overtures, Miss
Fields abandoned blandishment and
adopted taunts, and then every time he
passed her domicile his ears were as
sailed by insinuations which stung.
Finally he asked her to desist, and then
it was that, at six feet range, she
hurled the cuspidor, a crockery vessel
of several '! pounds weight. It struck
squarely the back of hl3 head, prostrat
ing him. His skull as well as the mis
sile was broken.
