PETALUMA, June 15. â Professor
W. L. Foss of Petaluma High School
suddenly lost his reason Monday and
is now confined In a private asylum
at Livermore. Overstudy is given as
the cause, and the outcome is
Vthought to account for the dissension
among the faculty of the Petaluma
institution noted for the past few
months and which has occasioned
wide comment. Foss had hired a
hall and announced a lecture for
Monday evening for the purpose of
telling all about the city's educational
system. His erratic conduct during
the last few days resulted in an inves

LIAOYANG, June 15.â The battle at
Vaf tnffow lasted till 8 o'clock yesterday
evening. The Japaneet In tremendous
fore* attacked the Russian position,
but were repulsed with terrible loss.
It is reported that three squadrons
of Japanese dragoons were absolutely
destroyed and that sixty men were
captured.
The Russian losses were 311 men.
Colonel Khvasteroff, commanding the
First Rifle Regiment, was killed.
According to the latest reports re
ceived here, the Russian troops were
attacking the Japanese at 6 o'clock this
morning, but no particulars are ob
tainable.
CLAIMS RUSSIAN VICTORY.
LONDON, June IB.â The correspond
ent of the Central News at Liaoyang
telegraphed to-day as follows:
"The fighting at Varangow (about
fifty-five miles north of Port Arthur)
was renewed to-day and Is still pro
reeding. No details are obtainable, but
there are persistent rumors that the
Russians were partly successful, de
stroying three squadrons of cavalry I
and making prisoners of Bixty men.
The Russian casualties in the fight
ing yesterday were 308 men killed or
wounded. The Japanese casualties are
not known.
"Later a section cf Russian cavalry
marching in the direction of Tafanchou
and Lunkoo discovered on Its right
Hank a gTeat force of Japanese cav

according to the latest dispatches fight

Japanese having received reinforce-'

NEW YORK, June 15.â James Collins,
a special policeman, together with Po
liceman Herbert Farrell and Olaf Jan-
Ben, mate of the schooner E. A. Bay
liss, were the first men to reach the
Slocum after she was beached. They
rowed out and took twenty-two' living
persons from the ship, besides picking
up sixteen bodies. Most of those res
cued were clinging to the paddles of
the Slocum, and three of the women
were dead with their hands still
clenched on the buckets of the wheel.
Collins said: ,
"I heard the terrible screaming out
in the stream. I looked up and saw the
Slocum blazing and persons dropping
into the water. With Farrell and Jan
eon I Jumped Into the yawl and rowed
after the burning ship as fast as possi
ble. Tugboats were then following her,
but the heat was so great they could
not get near her. When she beached
we pulled toward her, but as we came
nearer the heat singed our hair. We
threw our coats over our. heads and
pulled toward the roaring fire. Present
ly we found ourselves well up under the
sides of the ship.
"When I pulled the coat off my head
a terrible sight was before me. There,
clinging to the paddles of the great
wheel, were, It seemed to me, one hun
dred women and children and a few
men. As we came nearer they cried to
us frantically to save' them. Every sec
ond or two one of them would drop
Into the water and sink. We went
alongside, and by keeping away a few
feet managed to drag fourteen into the
boat.
" 'Hang on,' we cried, 'till we come
back.' But when we started to row
away others gave up and dropped into
the water. We landed our" first load
on a scow and went back twice more,
taking oft twenty-two.
"I noticed three large women who
seemed to be quieter than the others,
and we finally, dragged them into the
boat and found they were dead, but
still clinging to the paddles. Their heads
were partly under water.
"Several times we were nearly
swamped by women and children grab
bing the boat. We had to push back
those we could not save. I believe there
were more bodies went to the bottom
than were recovered. Most of these
never will be found."
NEW YORK, June 15.â One of the
most appalling disasters in the history
of New York, tragic in us Immensity,
dramatic I in its episodes and deeply
pathetic In the tender age of most of
its, victims, took place' to-day in the
East River, at the entrance to Long
Island Sound, . within - a short distance
of the New York shore and within
sight of thousands of persons, the ma
jority of whom were powerless to
minimize the extent of the catastrophe.
By the burning to the water's edge
of the Gei.aral Slocum, a three-decked
excursion steamship, the . largest in
these waters, more than 600 persons,
the majority of whom were women and
children, were burned to death or
drowned by Jumping overboard or by
being thrown Â¦ into the whirlpools by
the lurching of the vessel and the
frantic rush of the panic-stricken pas
sengers. '
- Approximately 485 bodies have been
recovered and are now being tagged
at the morgues of Bellevue Hospital
and Harlem.
Divers were still busy at a late hour
taking bodies from the hold of the
vessel, which, they say, is choked with
thQ remains of human bodies, while
the bodies of scores who leaped or were
thrown j Into- the river have not been
recovered. ,*
STARTS OX FATAL TRIP.
The General Slocum had been char
tered, to carry the excursionists to Lo
cust Grove, one of the many resorts
of Long Island Sound. It Is variously
estimated that there were between 1000
,and 1500. persons on board the Slocum
when she left the pier at Third street.

John Kdell. 22 years old. one of the
survivors of the disaster, gave the fol
lowing account of his terrible experi
ence, his mother and little brother hav
ing b^en drowned before his eyes:
"When we left the pier the decks
were packed to the limit of their ca
pacity. The band was playing, the
children were frolicking about, and we
were having a flue time. As we neared
Hell Gate the children were called
down to. the lower deck, where ice
cream and soda water were served.
They were literally falling over one
another In â¢ an effort to , get to the
tables which held the refreshments.
With my mother and my lHtle brother
Paul, I went to the engine-room to
watch the machinery.
"Suddenly there was a burst of flame
that rushed up through the engine
room and flashed cut about us. The
flames spread with the rapidity of an
explosion, setting fire to the clothing of
the women and children who were
grouped about the engine-room watch
ing the machinery. .
"There was the most terrible panic
as the burning . women* and children
rushed out among t'.iose surrounding
the Icecream " and soda water tables.
In the terrible scramble my mother and
little brother were swept away from
me and carried toward the. side where
the children and women, with ;thelr
clothes : burning, had begun-' to Jump
Into the water. The flames spread In
bursts that soon had the entire /deck
enveloped. : ,'Â¦/.--'
"The crew was helpless to render any
assistance or make efforts: to check the
advance of the fire. We were just pass-
Ing out through Hell Gate when the fire
started. The captain headed the boat
toward North Brother Island and the
pilots, whd were with him, yelled fran
tically to us to stay aboard until they
beached the boat. . But in a moment
after the flames had burst from the
engine-room j great . numbers began ; to
jump overboard. -The women were wild
with fright, and picking up their chil
dren leaped into the whirlpools that
"I got- my wife and daughter out on
the rail and then we went overboard.
I was in such an excited state that I
do not remember whether we were
hurled over or jumped.
'When I struck the water I Â«ank and
when I arose there Were scores about
me fighting to k-ep afir.at. Â¦ One by one,
I saw them sink Â»i round me. But I
was powerless to do anything.
"With a great effort I managed to
keep afloat, but my strength was about
gone when a man on one of 'the 'tugs
picked me yp."
Paul Lebenmv. one of the passengers
who was on' board, says a ferry-boat
passed near the burning steamship,
but offered no assistance.
"I believe that ' the first that, fell
into the water were crowded over
board. After this there seemed to be
a general Inclination to Jump. The
women and children went over the rail
ings like files. -
"In *ihe great crush many women
fainted and foil to the deck, to be tram
pled upon. Little children were knocked
down.
"When /the fire shot up to the top
deck and drove the crowd back the
panic wag terrible to witness. The
women and children clung to the rail
ings and stanchions, but could not keep
their holds. I. with my wife and
daughter, was swept along! with the
rest. S '
Rev. George C. F. Haas, pastor of the
church, was saved, but his wife, Ger
trude, and his daughter. Anna, are
among the dead. Haas told the story
of the disaster.
"The fire started in the kitchen, In
the forward part,' when we were oft
One Hundred and Thirty-fourth street,"
he said. "I understand that some fat
that boiled over started the blaze. At
that time most of the women and chil
dren were Jammed in the rear end of
the boat, where the band was playing.

boat for tho Meadows I do not under

NEW YORK, June 15.â One of the
first to go to the work of rescue was
Rev. Father Oonlan of St. Jerome's
Catholic Church. On hearing the news
of the disaster Father Donlan gathered
other priests arid started for the water
front. Although they knew it Wa*s 'a.
Lutheran picnk 1 , the priests felt that
It was their duty to give religious con
solation to all whom they encountered.
Father Donlan gave religious consola
tion to forty-five persons, forty-three
of whom died. â¢
When the news of the disaster be
came known there was a rush of tele
phonic and personal Inquiries at the
home of the pastor of the church,
George A. Haas. Geoige A Haas, son
of the pastor,, was the only member of
the family at home, and it fell to him
to inform all those who Inquired that
the reports were true.
As the news spread in the parish
crowds flocked around the church and
the parsonage and the scene was a pit
iful one. Large number* boarded the
elevated trains and hastened to One
Hundred and Thirty-eighth street,-
Business practically was at a standstill
in the neighborhood.
The two policemen on the boat were
William Van Tassel and George Kilt,
both of the harbor squad, who had been
detailed on the excursion. Van Tassel
was on the main deck, while Kilt was
stationed on the upper deck forward.
Van Tassel was . one ' of the first to
reach the main land from North Broth
er Island. He said that he heard what
he believed to be an explosion. Every
body screamed, and some men assisted
women to put on life-preservers, while
others appeared to be excited and were
unable to do anything.

PRIESTS GIVE CONSOLATION.
Meanwhile the Slocum burned to
the water's edge. At 12:25 o'clock,
two hours and twenty-five minutes af
ter the fire was discovered, she sank.
It 13 estimated there were; then nearly
100 charred bodies on her decks. Ju~t
after the steamship sank the water
near by was black with bodies. The
tug finally succeeded In picking up
eighty-eight charred corpses in Hunts
Cove, off Rikers Island, and carried
them into the sound. None of these
bodies, it is believed, can ever be
identified.
The scene was pitiable in fhe ex
treme as the living and the dead were
brought in. Rows of bodies were
stretched along the beach. Frantic
men went along looking at one after
another, searching for children and
friends. Women with disfigured faces,
their clothing partially stripped -from
them, were carried to the Improvised
emergency hospital, crying for chil
dren who had been torn from them
in the mad rush when the boat took
fire.
As the bodies of living and the dead
were taken out of the water those
alive were taken to the hospitals on
the island or sent across the river to
hospitals In Manhattan. Here ambu
lances from almost all the hospitals in
Greater New York and every 'other
scrt of conveyance which could be
found were put Into service.' Â¦ .
For hours the bodies of the burned
and the drowned drifted ashore on the
isfand and between One Hundred and
Thirty-f.rst and One Hundred and
Thirty-eighth streets in Manhattan.
Some persons came ashore still alive.
Many of these died, but others -will
recover.
The scene on North Brother Island,
as described by the rescuers, was a
pitiful one. Body after body was
washed ashore or brought In by boats
and added to the long row on the
beach. Fifty-three persons died while
the doctors were attending them.
The point where the Slocum beach
ed was Just off the scarlet fever ward
on North Brother Island. The pa
tients who had ; been out on the
porches and lawns watching the ap
proach of the burning vessel were or
dered Indoors and the physicians on
the island hastened to the assistance
of those who were being brought
ashore through the shallow water.
Many of those who leaped from the
Slocum were carried away by the cur-'
rent even after she was beached and
were drowned.
LOXG ROWS OF DEAD.

the crew of the Tracey,. which re
mained alongside until the tug's pilot
house took fire.
The policemen and the crew were
unable to release the bodies without
further mutilating them and arrange
ments were made to hoist ihc hatch
way with the bodies to it to the deck
of the Fidelity.
Amc-ng the boats that hurried to the
succor of the stricken passengers were
several tuss of the New York Central
and Hudson Railroad Company, the
auxiliary catboat Easytimes. the
Health Department steamer Massa
sert. These, with a swarm of row
boats manned by willing hands, ap
proached as near the blazing vessel
2rs was possible and rescued scores of
people. The Franklin Edson went so
close to the burning steamship that her
own palni was scorched. The crew of
the tug, however, stuck bravely to
their work and saved many "women
and children from a terrible death.
The fire had possession of the boat
from stem to stern by the time she
was off One Hundred and Eightieth
street. The fire boat Sophar Mills was
summoned from its moorings at the
foot of East Ninety-ninth street and
was soon on the scene, its crew lend
ing valuable aid in saving life.
To-night a crowd is held back by po
lice lines formed about the City
Morgue at the foot of East Twenty
sixth street. The crowd began to
gather as soon as it became rumored
about the city that the dead would be
brought to Manhattan, from North
Brother Island and other*- places where
at first the dead had been taken. When
the Massasert came to dock with
eighty-five dead., the work of remov
ing the bodies from the steamer pro
ceeded slowly until no more were found
and the autopsy-room was cleared and
the blackened and distorted bodies
were placed on the floor there. >j.v"
When, finally the Morgue authorities
allowed the crowd to enter the Morgue
a scene ensued which was harrowing
In the extreme. In some cases Identi
fications first were found to have beÂ«n
erroneous, men laying claim to bodies
and afterward discovering that they
were not those of their relatives.
At the entrance of the morgue the
crowd to-night tried to push past the
police and a riot resulted. At the
height of the trouble a man who had
learned that his wife was among Ik*
dead tried to stab himself.
â¢ All the while men in search of wives,
children or sisters were picking their
way from one covered forrr- to another
and as a face was uncovered and the
sheet turned bark upon it there was
renewed hope that after all those
sought' might be saved." or, at ths
worst, were only suffering at one or
the other of the hospitals.
Now and then a searcher was sadly
rewarded. A man would be seen to
fall upon his knees beside a form under
the trees, but it was seldom that one
could hear more than a stifled groan.
Mcfct pitiful of all was the grief of
one who found not one, but two or
three, of hi3 family among the dead,
as happened on several occasions, for
many a man was left not" only a wid
ower, but childless.
Boats are still ratroling the section
of thA stream where bodies might be
found and many are recovered as the
search continues. It will be days be
fore there can be any certainty that
no bodies still remain to be given up
by the river.
Many of the bodies cannot be iden
tified. Heads, legs and arms are
burned off and not a shred of clothing
is left on 'any of them.

on which were five or six charred bod
ies, was seen floating in the cove at

to a boat which bore it to one or other
of the city morgues.
In a paper bag, with its correspond
ing number, was laid away such Jew
elry or other means of Identification 1 as
could be found.
"No. 64. woman, one gold watcn.
one gold guard ring." was the char
acteristic inscription for one of these
bags.
Piled one above another in a basket
which follov.ed the Coroner on his
rounds, the bags accumulated in in
creasing numbers as the first estimates
of the loss of Hfe had to give away to
what at first had seemed to. be absurd
and exaggerated guesses as to the
number of victims of the disaster.
When a few more than 100 bodies hud
been recovered and the task of num
bering and tagging them was all un
der way. it semed that the end was in
sight, though , there were still hun
dreds of persons to be accounted for.
Many were the pathetic sights wit
nessed. Bodies of little children were
brought fn. clasped in each other's:
arms. So strong had death fastened
their hold on each other that whan
"lifted into the boat their arms were
still interlocked.
The work of recovering and tagging
bodies went on until more than 100 had
been recovered, after it had been hoped
that the river had already 1 "en up
most of its deadâ after the watchers
and workers had sighed with relief
that the worst was over.
It was Just before she beached that
her hurricane deck, . the supports of
which had burned away, fell with its
load of women, and children,: adding
to the panic and horror of those on
the deck below. Very *oon the after
parts of the second and third decks

Through all the wild panic, during
all that inferno, with fire and- smoke

men of the doomed boat remained at
their poets, but they were powerless

The Slocurn got within fifty feet of
the northwest pier- of North Brother
Island and there stopped in the shal
low water.
HEROISM OP THE . CREW.
It was an experience harrowing and
terrible and that any escaped alive
seems wonderful. < -' . â¢ '
In the wake of the Slocum as she
hurried up stream was a line of little
black specks, showing the heads of
those who had sought to escape the
roaring furnace of the ship by throw
ing themselves overboard.
Few of those saved by the small
boats had on life preservers. At no
time during the progress of the fire
was there an opportunity to either
lower the lifeboats or to get out the
life preservers. This, perhaps, gives an
idea of the rapidity with which the
flames swept the decks.- ' â¢ â
On the' Slocum the first sweep of
the flames cut off escape from the hur
ricane deck, where a great many of
the women and children were crowded
together, and soon burned away the
light wood of the uprights, which
came down with a crash on those be
low. It is thought that most' of those
on the hurricane deck were burned.
As the fire increased the struggle
to rain a point of vantage at the stern
"became frightful. Women and chil
dren crowded against the aft rail un
til it gave way and hundreds were
pushed off into the river. After this
there was a steady stream of persons
who Jumped or were thrown into the
water.
FIHE CUTS OFF ESCAPE.
The steamship's whistle was blow
ing for assistance and tugs and other
nearby craft answered the call. ' Be
fore any of the boats coulrl reach the
burning vessel, however, the fr.intic
Â¦women and children began to jump
overboard. The current was strong
and there are many whirlpools In the
channel. The boats that always
abound in that vicinity picked many
passengers from ihe water, but these
v.-ere only a Email number of those
who were seen struggling in the swift
current.
Ey this time the flames were rushing
by leaps and bounds from the forward
part of the ship aft. The great open
decks, built for excursionists, offered
a. clear sweep for the fire.
As the Slocum dashed forv/ard the
flames caught stanchion and cabin
woodwork, eating and tearing their
way across the vessel.
The excursionists, but a few minutes
before in the full enjoyment of an
ideal summer's day on Long Island
Sound, were driven to the after part
of the steamship to escape the h'jat.
flames ard smoke that were constantly
Increasing. Policemen and deckhands
aboard the boat struggled hard to quiet
the panic, but their efforts were in
vein. The wild disc-rder increased as
frantic mothers sought their children
who had been at play about the decks.
Changing the big Fteamship's course
slightly, he headed her for North
Brother Island, a half mile away.
FLAMES QUICKLY SPREAD.
The steamship after leaving her dock
this morning proceeded up the East
River, all three of her decks crowded
Â¦with merrymakers. Bands played and
the great sidewheekr was decorated
with flags from stem to stern.
The Slocum had reached a point near
the Sunken Meadows off One Hundred
and Thirty-fifth street. Manhattan,
which is at the extreme eastern end of
Randalls Island, when fire broke out
in a luncheon room on the forward
deck. The blaze was caused by the
overturning of a pot of grease.
The wir.d almost instantly fanned the
insignificant flame into a fury. The
blare spread like lightning. Captain
Van Schaick, in the pilot-house, had
been informed of the outbreak of the
fire and being aware of the danger,
decided to send his vessel to shore at
One Hundred and Thirty-fourth street.
At this point there are a number of
lumber yards and several huge oil
tanks and the captain was warned
that to attempt to land at this point
would endanger the property and per
haps further imperil the scores of per
sons who had already been frightened
into a state of almost uncontrollable
excitement.
NEW YORK. Jur.e 15.â The three
decked Fteamshin General Slocum of
the Knickerbocker Steamboat Company
burned to the water's edge off North
Brothers Island, East River, at the en
trance to Li.nc Island Sound, to-day,
resulting in the death through burning
or drownlns of at least 6U0 persons,
mostly women and children. Four hun
dred and ninety-tight bodies had been
recovered to-day' and divers were at
work taking bodies from the hold of
the steamship. The remains of many
j.Â» -i Ki.iis u ho lea:Â»ed into the river have
not yet been found, and it will bo many
hours before the list of dead is any
where near complete.
The General Slocum, one of the
largest excursion steamships in these
waters, left Third street. East River, at
S:30 o'clock this morning, having on
board the Sunday-school excursion of
St. Mark's German Lutheran Church,
located on Sixth street. Her destina
tion was Locust Grove, one of the
many resorts on Long Island Sound.
The excursion was in charge of Rev.
George C. Haas, pastor of the church.
The vessel was commanded by Cap
tain W. A. Van Schairk. one of the best
known excursion beat captains in New
York harbor. He has commanded the
Slocum for almost the entire time since
fhe was built, in 1S91.

This didn't do anv good, because we
couldn't get any water through the
hose. I went to the promenade deck
forward, where I pulled down four
strings of life preservers.
"There was a panic. It was absolute

grabbed for preservers. I tried to put
one on three times, and they were torn

Certainly the Tivoli powers-that-be
received a piece of her mind, and Miss
Dora de Fillippi will sing Annabel in
"Robin Hcod" next week.
"Of course I spoke of the manner
in which Miss Stfton had been treat
ed," said Miss Redledge last night,
"for it was a shame. I said so to Mr.
Strine and he sent me to Mr. Leahy.
To-day as I came past the Tivoli just
before rehearsal the first thing I saw
was a big flaming handbill <ot 'Robin
Hood* and my name was not on It.
I asked Mr. Leahy to come and ex
plain it all. and he said explanations
were not in order. When I got home
j I found a note from the theater telling
i me that my contract was canceled. '
"One of the managers of the Tivoli
! said he wished I were a man. For his
special benefit I heartily wish I were
for a short time. I have sung In the
East and in London with the best of
companies and neither Miss Sefton nor
myself had to come out here to the
Tivoli to be told after only two j-e
hearsals that we can't sing. But we'll
not bother the Tivoli over the matter.
They may cancel our contracts â a
clause gives them that power â but we
claim the two weeks?' notice and fare
back to Xew York. They have treated
us coarsely and shabbily."
Last week Miss Sefton and her "Ser
geant Kitty" went down and yester
day .her friend Â¦ and comrade. Miss
Flcrye Redledge. who had been cast in
Miss Sefton's place to warble Anna
bel's lines in "Robin Hood" next week,
was taken off after two rehearsals.
The management gives as a reason
for this' second change in the song bill
that Miss Redledge's work as shown
in the rehearsals was not satisfactory,
but the singer avers in several octaves
that her fellowship, friendship and
championship for and of Miss Sefton
is the threefold reason of her dis
mirsaL
The Tivoli stage tempests have

Her testimony developed a rather
remarkable story of domestic and
financial troubles. She owned prop
erty at 826 Ellis street, extending
through to Olive, and it was worth
several thousand dollars. She mort
gaged it for 36000, and after getting
into debt she deeded the holding to
W. H. Ghickering, who canceled her
obligation of $1500 to him and as
sumed: the mortgage. She contends
that it was agreed that a clause giv
ing her a life interest in her home
should be inserted in the deed.
Mrs. Dolon is of French and negro
extraction, and in 1875 married a
white man named Edgerly. who, she
said, was the confidential clerk of a
mining man named McDermott. Mc-
Derroott-and Edgerly. were accused of
salting the Pleasant Valley mine for
purposes of fraudulent sale. She was
in possession of a letter from Me-
Dc-rmott to Edgerly regarding the af
fair, and Mr. Chickering, who ! was
engaged in the litigation, called on
her for a photographic copy of the
letter and received it. Edgerly was
arrested and she and Chickering: went
on his bond, obtaining hl3 release from
Jail. . Edgerly fled to Honolulu and
the bonds were forfeited. Later Ed
gerly was induced to return and the
case was dismissed.
She said that Edgerly had put her
deeply in debt and she found that he
was a "mean man." Then she took
advantage of the negro in her veins
and used it as an excuse to secure an
annullment of her marriage. In
what year she did this she does not
remember. Her finances were In
bad shape and she borrowed from
Mr. Chickering in small sums until
she owed him about $1500. She made
her will in his favor and later trans
ferred the property as stated.
In Judge Seawell's court yesterday
was commenced the hearing of the
suit wherein Cecile Dolon. a mas

"Three times the tugboat caught fire.

"Olsen saw three children not more

whistles kept blowing for assistance,
but before the whistles had begun to
blow several tugs, the captains of
which had seen the outbreak of the
fire, started after the vessel, while sev

The number of these craft constantly

from the burning vessel. Men crowded
to the rails of the tugs and caught up
the drowning persons as they were

/WASHIXGTOX, June 16.â The Sec
retary of the Interior in the case of
Hugo Sontag vs. Edward W. Reid,
arising in the "Los Angeles land dis
trict, Cal., has held that the act of
June 3, 1878,. known as the timber
and stone act, does not authorize the
sale of land the chief value of which
consists in small trees or brush there^
on, the existence and maintenance of
which are necessary to preserve : the
waters of a stream for Irrigation pur
poses, but which have no value for
commercial purposes. '
It has generally been supposed that
the ealtness of the waters at the Dead
Sea is due to the soil and rocks. It is
now thought, however, that this ex
planation is Inadequate, and that thÂ«
most important cause is the atmos
pheric transportation of salt from the
Mediterranean Sea. According to a
writer in Harper's WeeKly. the sup
position is that the winds blowing from
the Mediterranean would bring rain
charged with Bait. In proof of this it

A phonograph in which the "sound

place of the trumpet ordinarily used.
When the sound waves fall on It Its
combustion is changed from a contin

burning gas is thrown Into a series of
waves that are more powerful than
the original sound waves, thus rein

Casteel is held at the City Prison
charged with assault to commit mur
der. He came to this city about. four
years ago and had been variously em
ployed until he met Durham and be
came a partner in the business college.
He was formerly a resident of Knox
vllle, Tenn. - : . .
Calmly putting the pistol into his
pocket, Casteel brushed through a
crowd of terrified students who hur
ried to the office. He left his victim
staggering against a wall.' Mrs. Dur
ham, the wife of the wounded man,
assisted him to a couch, after which
he was hurried to the Lane Hospital,
where he lies close to death.
With the pace-and dem?anor of a
citizen traveling on an every day af
fair, Casteel proceeded to the City
Hall. He walked Into the" Sheriff 's of
fice shortly after he had committed the
deed and gave himself up to . Under
Sheriff Hines. Casteel said he had
shot Durham as the result bf financial
troubles. Casteel said Durham Â¦ had
drawn the weapon and In the scuffle
two shc-ts were discharged.. Casteel
said he did not know how many adtJir
tional shots he had fired.- but investi
gation disclosed that four cartridges
were empty. Casteel was allowed to
telephone to his attorney, Franklin K.
Lane, after he had turned the pistol
over to. Hines, who then tc-ok him
down to the Hall of Justice and de
livered him over to the police..
Casteel retains his composure, and
with cool politeness refuses to make
any statement or to deny Anything said
by the wounded man. HI* attorney Is
equally reticent. Neither client nor
lawyer would throw any light on. the
financial transactions that led; to the
shooting.
Durham fully believed his condition
to be precarious and made a dying
statement to Assistant District Attrr
ney Ferrari. He said In substance:
perately to the pistol, but his assailant
kicked his hand away. Standing over
the nrostrate man Casteel deliberately
fired a shot into his victim's back.
Then he snapped the weapon, once
more,, but It missed fire. A third shot
struck the floor.
At the sound of the bell Miss Meyer
started to go to the office. She stood-on
the threshold as the., first shot was
fired. For a .moment she remained,
stunned by fright, and saw Casteel fire
the second time at her employer. Then
she fled screaming.

PORTLAND, Or.. June 15. â Ac
cording to the Government crop re
ports the outlook this season in re
gard to the prune crop in this State
ls^very discouraging: In Southern
Oregon riot, over 40 per cent of the
average crop Is looked for, while in
Northwestern Oregon, not. more than
20 per cent is. anticipated. The
weather in the middle western part of
the State has been no better th*n that
in the other fruit districts and upon
this basis it is figured that taken al
together the State will produce about
30 per cent of the normal crop.
The apple crops In Southern Oregon
and the apple crop in the Hood River
district are expected to be over the
average. The . crops in small fruits
have generally been above the average.
The shipments of strawberries alone
from the Hood River district have now
been 150 cars.
Government Reports Show That Yield
Will Be Thirty Per Cent of
Average Yield.

WASHINGTON, June 15. âActing
Secretary of the Treasury Tavlor to
day received a telegram from President
Francis of the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position,, asking- for a construction of
the law In relation to the reimburse
ment of the $4,600,000 Government loan.
President Francis inquired whether the
40 per cent due the Government to-day
from revenues of the fair shall.be based
on actual collections or on the earnings
to date.
The Treasury Department ruled. that
the payment should be made from
actual collections, rather than from the
earnings. The latter construction would
have Involved a delay, of several days
in depositing the installment in the sub
treasury at St. Louis. The first three
fortnightly installments paid are to be
40 per cent of the revenues. After July
15. each installment must consist of at
least $500,000 until the loan is reim
bursed.

JAPANESE DELAY ATTACK.
CHEFU, June 16 (noon).â From a re
liable source it is learned that the
Japanese had 60.000 men on the Liao
tung Peninsula ten days ago. It is be
lieved that it Is their intention to use
100,000 men in the attack on Port Ar
thur. Possibly it will be a fortnight
before they are ready to make the ex
pected attack.
A Chinese who was employed in the
machine shops at Port Arthur is au
thority for the statement that the re
pairs to the Russian warships only con
sisted of placing sheets of steel over the
damaged parts. No attempt was made
to replace the damaged ribs. He also
confirms previous Chinese reports to
the effect that of the fleet of battleships
and cruisers only five are capable of
fighting.
According to the best information
these vessels are the battleships Pol
tava and Sevastopol and the cruisers
Bayan, Askold and Novik. Some con
tend that the battleship Peresvlet and
the cruiser Diana are not damaged.
The Chinese machinist says the ma
chinery of a large vessel, the name of
which is unknown to him, was wrecked
recently by a shell.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 16.â
Scanty details of the fighting at
Vafangow have been received here,
but they came in too late for official
comment or even reference in the ear
lier editions of the morning papers.
The fact that a message from the
field stated that the attack was re
newed on the morning of June 15
and that, the Russians were the ag
gressors seems to Indicate that the
Japanese not only failed to carry the
point of their initial attack, but may
be forced to fall back if General
Stakelberg manages to maintain his
position in the face of the strong Jap
anese forces opposing him until Rus
sian reinforcements, which are known
to be a short distance in the rear, ar
rive.
Preparing for Flight to China.
G YANGTZE, Tibet, June 15. â The
British have captured a lama who

threatened.
Drath of a Millionaire Cattleman.
DENVER, Colo., June 15. â George
H. Adams, a millionaire cattleman
end owner of the Adams Hotel in this
city, died of heart disease at his home
here to-<lay. He was born at New
Orleans In 1845.
SHANGHAI, June IB.â The British
fleet left Wusung to-day for the Saddle
Islands, at the month of HangchOw
Bayv. about eighty miles southeast of
Shanghai.
British Fleet Changes Base.
The Japanese fleet Is no longer able
to support the army, the water along
the coast being too shallow to permit
the vessels to approach: . Â¦
Port Arthur is well provisioned.
There are 9000 head of cattle there and
Everything was in readiness for the
retirement, however, and the Russians
returned to Port Arthur by train, leav
ing bfjrind them only some old Chinese
guns, the breechlocks of which had
been destroyed.
The Japanese artillery fire was well
directed, but the Russians suffered
more from Â¦ the fire of the Japanese
gunboats.
When the Russian merchant from
whom these details were obtained left
Port Arthur the Japanese were within
twelve mfles of that place. The Rus
sians have trenches and earthworks
at intervals of two miles throughout
this distance. Â¦
CHEFU, June 15.â Further details of
the fighting at Kinchou the latter part
of last month have been ootained from
a Russian merchant who was there at
the time and who has arrived here on
a Junk. He says that when the Chinese
announced the Japanese approach on
Klnchou, the Russians were unable to
obtain accurate information as to the
strength of the enemy, four thousand
men from the Twenty-sixth and Twen
ty-seventh Regiments, who were sent
out to reconnoiter, met the Japanese
on the plains. The enemy was about
35,000 strong. The Infantry arms en
gaged and the Russians lost 200 men
before they could reach the shelter of
their trenches. The Russians claim
that the Japanese lost ten men to their
one in this preliminary engagement.
When the Japanese warships com
menced the bombardment of the Rus
sian trenches from Kinchou shot
and shell fell among the Russians like
hail and it was impossible for them to
hold their position.
It had been the intention of the Rus
sians to evacuate Kinchou, but the
Japanese attacked them before they
had time to move out.

Other firms have supplied the authori
ties at Port Arthur with provisions. .
This. merchant estimates the number
of men at Port Arthur at 50,000. This
exceeds the Chinese estimates by 20,000
men. -:.,..
.TIENTSIN, June 15. â It has been
learned here from a Russian source
that 40,000 Russians passed Tashi
chao, twenty miles south of New
chwang, last Monday, going south
ward. It Is supposed that this force
is going to the relief of Port Arthur.
General Ma has removed his head
quarters from Chaoyarig to Plngchlu
chow. Viceroy Yuan Shai Kai, com
mander In chief of the Chinese forces,
has refused General Ma's request for
10,000 more troops. It is believed
here that there are 40,000 Chinese im
perial soldiers on the Mongolian bor
der.
LARGE ARMY ADVAXCIXG.
MANILA, June 16.â The Spanish-
Filipino Bank claims that the issuance
of the new currency, or what is gener
ally known here as the "Conant notes,"
Is illegal, and it will, it is stated, bring
suit against the Federal Government,
alleging that Under the treaty of Paris
ceding the Philippines to the United
States the bank has the exclusive right
to issue bills which shall circulate as
money in the islands.
The proposed Internal revenue law
for the Philippine Islands provides that
a tax of 12 per cent shall be put upon
a bank note issue in excess of its capi
tal stock. The Spanish-Filipino Bank
also is opposed to this, claiming that
the position of the bank under Ameri
can sovereignty is analogous to that
of the trustees of Dartmouth College
after the American Revolution. The
matter will be taken before the author
ities at Washington.

Routed Russian Army Abandons Its Guns on the Battlefield
TOKIO, June 15, i p. m.â A flotilla of
torpedo . boats and torpedo-boat de
stroyers, under the command of Cap
tain Tsuchiya, and co-operating with
the army, made a reconnaisance in
force near Siauplng Island yesterday
and bombarded the Russians' outposts
on the coast to the west or the island.
Siauping Island is twelve miles west
of Port Arthur.
At noon the Russian cruiser Novik,
convoying ten torpedo-boat destroyers,
steamed out from Port Arthur. The
Russian shore batteries protected these
vessels with a heavy cannonade. The
Japanese flotilla retreated slowly, firing
as it went, for the purpose of decoying
the enemy to sea. At 3 o'clock in the
afternoon the Russian ships returned
to the entrance of Port Arthur.
The fact that the Novik came out of
Port -Arthur makes it certain that the
Russians have succeeded in blasting a
channel through the cement-laden
merchantmen sunk by the Japanese in
the entrance to the harbor. This free
dom of egress comes too late to per
mit of any effect upon the operations
of the Japanese army, for men, guns
and 'stores, have practically all been
landed and Admiral Togo Is capable of
keeping the remnant of the Russian
fleet imprisoned In Port Arthur.
Last Monday night Japanese vedette
boats, protected by torpedo boats and
torpedo-boat destroyers, succeeded In
reaching- the- entrance to Port Arthur
and planting a series of mines there.
The darkness of midnight favored the
operation. The Japanese vessels were
hot observed and. they returned to the
rest' of the" squadron without having
sustained "any -damage.
The dispatch of divisions southward
is not entirely attributable to a desire
to relieve the pressure on Port Arthur,
as it is considered that the fortress
would lose most of its importance to
Russia, from a strategical standpoint.
If the naval squadron there succeeded
In escaping and effecting a Junction
Â¦with the squadron commanded by Vice
Admiral Skyrdloff. Stakelberg's pur
rose is mainly intended to discourage
the landing of a fourth Japanese army,
which the authorities have reason to
believe is planned, on the west coast of
the Liaotung Peninsula, near New
chwang. whence it could co-operate
with General Kuroki's advance upon
Liaoyang.
Both sides retained their positions
efter the encounter yesterday, when
the fighting was of the most desperate
character on the Russian left wing.
The adversaries brought up all the
Fupports possible during the height of
the battle and the combat was resumed
this morning. With the whole Third
army behind General Nozu, there is
apprehension that Stakelberg may be
unable to get together a sufficient
force to successfully oppose the enemy.
The authorities here have success
fully concealed up to this time the
number of Russian troops on the pe
ninsula. It now develops that Stakel
berjfs entire corps has been centered
at Kaichou (about twenty miles south
cf Newchwang).
Not clnce the war began had such
excitement been apparent at the War
End Naval ministries as reigned there
to-<lay. With the encounter between
th? opposing fleets imminent and heavy
fighting in progress south of Vafangow
(Liaotung Peninsula, about fifty-five
miles north of Port Arthur and along
the line established by the Japanese
reaching across the peninsula from
Pitzewo to Port Adams), news both
from the land and sea was awaited
vith feverish anxiety. The general
FtafT believes that the Japanese force
which attacked Major General Goin
prcss' division yesterday was the ad
vance force of General Nozu's entire
army, of nearly 50,000 men. General
liaron Stakelberg, who commands the
First Siberian Corps, is personally di
recting the operations at the front.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 15.â The

has almost 200,000 troops, irrespective
of frontier and railroad guards, and
that probably he has an effective array
of 160.000 men at Liaoyang.
Dembowski is a distinguished strat

Later he became head of the Paul In

"The fact that tire. Russian protected

She is now in dock there. ,
ST. PETERSBURG. June 15.â No in
formation is obtainable here regarding
the reported engagement between the
Russian Vladivostok squadron and a
Japanese squadron in the ' Korean
Straits. But it is likely that a naval
fight has occurred, or is about to oc
cur. Vice Admiral Skrydloff has left
Vladivostok with the armored cruisers
Gromoboi, Rossiag and Rurlk and
some torpedo craft. As this fact is
already known abroad, the, press be

TOKIO. June 15, 7 p. m.â Reports of
cannonading have been received here
from various points, such as Chlkuzen
Province. Ik! Island and Tsushima, but
the exact nature of the operations of
the Russian Vladivostok squadron is
not disclosed.' It is possible that the
Russian vessels surprised and captured
three transports which left Shlmono
seki to-day for the army bases in Ko
rea and China. The course of these ves
sels would have taken them close to
the place where the Russian ships were
seen. It Is possible also that the Rus
sians are pursuing merchantmen, and
that the cannonading reported Is a re
sult of such pursuits.
The Japanese warships in the vicinity
are hurrying to the scene. Sasebo is
being closed. There Is a strong possi
bility that a naval engagement will
take place soon. No southern Japanese
city Is exposed to attack, but this Rus
sian raid may prove expensive to ship-
The indications are that the Russian
squadron is moving eastward. This in
creases the chances for an open sea
engagement. The Japanese are pursu
ing, keenly eager for a fight.
The Vladivostok squadron evidently
attacked the Japanese transports Hita
chi and Sado yesterday off Iki Island.
The details of the attack have not
been received here.

NAGASAKI. June 15.â A telegram re
ceived from Iki Island says that Japa
nese warships have engaged a Russian
squadron near there and that the result
of the encounter is not yet known.
TOKIO. June 16, 9 a, m.â Although It
is rumored a Japanese squadron over
took and engaged the Vladivostok
squadron off Iki Island In the straits
of Korea, it is extremely Improbable
that there has been an engagement.
The weather has again favored the
Russian fleet. The storm, accompanied
by a heavy rain, which swept over the
sea in the neighborhood of Tsu Island
yesterday hid the movements of the
Russian vessels. One Japanese scout-
Ing vessel Is reported to have got In
touch with the Russian squadron and
to have followed It. It probably lost
the Russians when night came on.
The captain of a Japanese merchant
ship reported this morning, that his
ship was fired upon by a Russian war
ship. """â '

The Central News ' dispatch added
that the Vladivostok squadron* was
first reported on June 14 from Iki Is
land (off Kioto, Japan, In the Sea of

was heard northwest of .- Nagato (on
the Japanese coast, in the Straits of

p. m. to-day, says:
"A dispatch Just received from Moji

colds which are dangerous ; for many a
fatal sickness begins with a cold. If we
could tell the cotnraon cold from the un-

caa't. The cncomiaon variety is rarely
reccKT.ired until it has fastened its hold on
the lucjrs, and there are symptoms of con-
sumption.
At the first symptoms the carefnl person
will heed the warning by taking: a mild
laxative ; some vegetable pill that will not
disturb the system or cause griping-. About
the best is "Dr. I'iercs's Pleasant Pellets."
If the cold starts with a cough, and it
persists then some lecal treatment for this
condition &hould be taken. A well known

Mrs. Blanchard has used every means
in her power to induce the young
woman to return . home, but without
avail. She still insists that she wants
to make her own way in the world,
though she has cast off the suicide
story and admits her identity.. ;
Mrs. Blanchard says that she never
believed the suicide story at any time.
A correspondence was kept up be
tween the two and finally Miss Lillian
E. Ileald confessed to her sister that
she had left home for the purpose "of
making her own way in the world. She
admlttecNthat she had arranged the
suicide story, that she had written the
letters signed "Mrs. Reynolds." pur
porting to give' an account of the sui
cide, that she had described herself
and her own clothingMn this letter and
that she had done all this in order
that she might be able to support her
self and not be dependent upon others.
She admitted that the only unfortu
nate feature in her story of suicide was
that the tide was out when she was
supposed to have committed suicide.
When pressed for a reason as to why
she had allowed her relatives to think
that Khe had committed suicide, she
only said that, she thought that they
would cease to worry if they thought
that she was dead.
But even after the discovery , of her
subterfuge Miss Heald has refused to
return home. She finally admitted her
identity and then disappeared .from
Bakersfleld. Her next appearance was
at Fallbrook, where she has been re
siding under the name of. "Mrs. Mary
Wilson." and she is 1 still supposed to
be there.
WRITE TO EACH OTHER.
Then Mrs. Blanchard began adver
tising for her sister and she spent no
little money in this way. But no an
swer came, and the mysterious "Mrs.
Reynolds" even remained silent.
Then it was that Mrs. Blanchard dis
covered that a young woman was liv
ing In Bakersfield under the name of
"Mrs. Reynolds." Here again was the
mysterious nameâ the name of the
woman who had written , the letters
about the missing girl.
Mrs. Blanchard adopted the same
methods that had been used by the
missing woman. She wrote a letter to
Bakersfield, addressed it to "Mrs. Rey
nolds" and signed an assumed name.
The letter got an answer, and after
that it was only a question of fol
lowing the missing girl in her wander-
Ings.
It was on Tuesday, April 12, that the
people of Oakland were startled with
the story of the disappearance c/f Miss
Lillian E. Hea'.d. Mrs. Sydney Blanch
ard of 855 Thirty-seventh street report
ed to the police that her sister. Miss
Heald, had disappeared. Shortly after
that Mrs. Blanebard began to receive
letters signed "Mrs. Reynolds," : and it
was this that /led to the location of
Miss Heald. This location and dis
covery were not accomplished for some
time, and not until much money had
been spent in advertising and detec
tive work, for Miss Heald did every
thing in her power -to block the search.
She even wrote letters, under the false
name of "Mrs. Reynolds," describing
her own supposed suicide.
It was these letters, however, that
finally brought to light the where
abouts of the missing girl.
The supposed "Mrs. Reynolds", seem
ed to know more about Miss Heald
than did even her sister. "Mrs. Rey
nolds" wrote to Mrs. Blanchard and
to the newspapers that she hr.d seen
a woman, answering the description
of Miss Heald. standing at the foot of
B Btreet; that the woman had sudden
ly thrown herself into the bay at that
point and that she had drowned under
the eye of "Mrs. Reynolds." Unfor
tunately for the story "Airs. Reynolds'
mentioned the time of day, 2:30 o'clock
in thÂ» afternoon. Mrs. Blanchard con-Â»
suited the tide tables and discovered
that the tide, at that time, was out,
and that there was nothing but Jhe
mud flats at the foot of B street.
HUNTED FOR SISTER.
The girl gives as her reason for dis
appearing and setting up a false story
of suicide that she desired to end a
life of idleness and begin making a
name for herself. . â¢
OAKLAND. June 15.â The mystery
of the disappearance of Miss Lillian E.
Heald has been solved. Instead of
having committed suicide in a tragic
manner at the foot of B street in North
Oakland she is quietly residing in
Fallbrook in the southern part of this
State in the full possession of all her
faculties. * . .

The members -who pledged the
amounts necessary to complete the
building fund were George D. "Gray.
Francis Cutting. George T. Hawley.
George H. Collins. E. H. Vance. C. Z.
Merritt. D. Edward Collins. F. B.
Cook. Dr. R. L. Stratton. R. H. Cham
berlain. H. R. Jones. James A. John
son and. Dr. G. E. Brinkerhoff.
There were several verbal pledges,
and a number of people had promised
to subscribe to the building fund, but
they were out of town and their
pledges could not be secured.
The terms of the contract under
which the subscriptions were made
specify explicitly that pledges for
$150,000 must be in the hands of the
association by midnight on Wednes
day, June 15. The directors and trus
tees of the organization were confront
ed with a deficit of $7100, whioh
would have to be raised by midnight
to-night. After some discussion the
payment of this amount was assumed
by twelve members of the board of
trustees and the directors and the
pledges completing the $150,000 were
then signed.
The condition under which the di
rectors and trustees undertook thÂ»
payment of the deficit was that the
first subscriptions received subse
quent to the action of the two boards
should be applied to the payment of
the $7100.
When all the pledges had been
summed up at the Joint meeting of the
two boards this evening it was found
that the association was still $7H*>
short. Counting the amount pledged
by the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Y. M.
C A. and all other subscriptions the
amount pledged reached a total of
$142,900.
Literally at the eleventh hour to
nights the board of directors and trus
tees of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation raised the remainder of the
fund of $150,000 for the erection of a
new Y. M. C. A. building, and by so
doing bound all the pledges already se
cured, and the erection of the new
building is now assured.

While Congressman Victor H. Met
talf positively refuses to discuss the
question of his entering the Cabinet,
it is generally believed that Mr. Met
<-alf will accept, and that as soon as
Secretary Corelyou of the new De
partment of Commerce and Labor re
tires to assume the control of the next
campaign of President Roosevelt Mr.
Metcalf will be named as his suc
cessor. So certain are the people or
Oakland that Mr. Metcalf will accept
that plans are already being made by
those who want to be his successor in
the lower house.
The facts are that Mr. Metcalf has
been tendered the position, just as has
been stated in the dispatches from
Washington, Â»nd the facts are that the
ftory of his acceptance will have to
come from Washington as well. But
it is safe to say that when the story
does come from Washington it will
be the story of an acceptance.
Mr Metcalf is strictly regarding the
proprieties and declines to discuss a
matter that U solely in the hands of
the President of the United States.
He says frankly that if anything is
said or done that it must come from
those who are in a position to say
and to do. and those persons are in
Washington.
WILL SAY NOTHING.
'There is nothing that I can say."
is all that Mr. Metcalf would offer to
those who asked of him a statement
about the Washington dispatches.
The tender of the position to Mr.
Metcalf came a few days ago. when it
became known that there would be a
general change in the Cabinet of Pres
ident Roosevelt, made necessary by
the desire of Secretary Moody of the
navy and Postmaster General Payne
to retire, the desire of the President
that Secretary Cortelyou of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor
should manage his campaign and the
flection of Attorney General Knox to
the United States Senate. Since the
first tender came Mr. Metcalf ha* been
Jn consultation with his friends and
there has been much discussion of the
move.
It Is an interesting fact that, if Mr.
Metcalf is elevated to the Cabinet* the
only representatives that California
has ever had In the family of the
President came from the Third Con
gressional District. Joseph McKenna
was appointed by President McKinley
to be Attorney General, and now Mr.
Metcalf, who came from the same
district, is to be Secretary of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor.
WILL MAKE GREAT CHANGE.
The retirement at this time of Mr.
Metcalf will make a great change
upon this side of the bay. There have
been no candidates for Congress
against Mr. Metcalf and it leaves an
open field. There are a number of
residents of Alameda, Contra CoÂ«ta
and Solano counties who would like to
succeed Mr. Metcalf. but who would
not contest with him for the place.
Among them are State Senators
Lukens. Leavitt and Knowland of
Alameda; Belshaw of Contra Costa,
and District Attorney Frank Devlin
and Alden Anderson of Solano. The
retirement of Mr. Metcalf will be sud
den and there will be a scramble for
his ehoes.

Three fires that broke out in quick
succession in a box car at the Berkeley
station freight sheds kept Policeman
George Thompson busy last night.
There seems to be something behind
it all and the police are on the lookout
for some bold crime that these fires
may conceal. Town Marshal Kerns
and Officer Thompson have concluded
that the fires were started by a person
in league with a brace of burglars,
who hoped to keep the police busy at
something else while they worked.
The first fire started a little after 3
o'clock. It was discovered by C. R.
Hoessli and Charles Fischel, who saw
smoke coming from a car standing on
the track at the station. They called
Ppliceman Thompson and he stamped
it out. An hour afterward another fire
started up and Thompson extinguished
it, too, but he had not been gone ten
minutes before a third fire began. It
gained such headway, however, that
Thompson could not stamp it out and
he called out the fire department, which
soon quertched the flames. The fires
were started in a big pile of paper that
filled the car.

During the trial of the case the truth
came out. An expert employed by Sul
livan's attorneys measured the mate
rial that had been used, and by no pos
sibility could the amount charged
against the premises have been used
there. Then there was evidence to show
that shingles and lumber had been
carted away, and the lumber company
will have to sue the contractor or the
people into whose houses the lumber
went.
The trick of a contractor who sent
lumber to one house and then used it
on another cost the Humboldt Lumbfrf
Company a suit in the courts to-day,
and Judgment was given "in favor of
Jtrre Sullivan of Berkeley, the defend
ant in the case, who objected to pay
ing for material that had gone into the
houses of his neighbors.
"This seems to be a question between
an honest buyer, an honest seller and a
dishonest contractor," said Judge Mel
vin to-day in rendering his decision.
During the trial of the case it was
shown that W. A. Forbes, a contractor,
had ordered material for Sullivan's
house from the Humboldt Lumber
Ccmpany. The lumber was delivered
as ordered, but afterward large quanti
ties of it were amoved and went into
buildings close by. Forbes failed to
settle his bill with the lumber company
and it filed a mechanic's Hen against
Sullivan's house for the unpaid portion
of $231.

A horse that Robert Grlffen, aged 12
years, was riding this morning in front
of his home at 1614 Oregon street sud
denly reared and threw its rider to the
ground in such a way as to land him
squarely on the top of his head. The
result was a fractured skull and the
youth now lies at the Fablola Hospital,
hovering between life and death.
The injured Jad is a practiced horse
man, but he was off his guard when
the horse took a notion to resent the
urging of his rider. It was all so sud
den that he did not have time to se
cure himself before he was hurled to
the ground with great force. The con
cussion was rendered ali the mere se
vere on account 'of the character of the
road, which is of hard macadam. His
fall was seen by some companions, who
carried him to his home. Dr. Wood
son Allen was summoned and ordered
the lad's removal to Fablola. The boy
is a son of Thomas R. Griffen.

After Judge Mogan had pronounced
"Dr." W. J. Sylvester guilty of prac
ticing medicine without a license the
defendant's attorney asked that the
minimum fine of Jino be imposed, as
his cliont had altered the signboard of
his oSce on Koarny Ftreet so that it
no longer is likely to mislead the pass
ing seeker of medical aid. its amended
legend being "The Dr. W. J. Sylvester
Company." This plea for leniency was
opposed by the prosecution, which
stated that while the signboard In
question now reads as the defense al
loged. the letters of the word "Com
pany" were so much smaller than those
of the preceding words that they were
comparatively Indistinguishable. The
Judge then deferred sentence till to

to effect further amendment of the
signboard.

Thus spake Lena Hecht. tall and
corpulent, gazing with expression of
withering contempt at Mark Schleiber,
jÂ»uny of person and shrinking of de
meanor, as the pair stood before the
bench of Mogan. Mark had been ar
rested for threatening to decapitate
l>na because she has abandoned him,
and he had pleaded that his blood
thirsty behavior was provoked by the
woman's refusal to restore certain ar
ticles of his wearing apparel which had
accompanied her when she left him.
"Clothes, paugh! Why, all the
clothes he ever owned at one time I
could carry like that," exclaimed Lena,
crooking a plump arm to illustrate the
meaperness of Mark's wardrobe.
It was after Mark had promised to
return to New Orleans, whence he had
followed Lena to this city, that the
offer to pay his fare was made. So it
was arranged. A policeman accom
panied the pair to see that the woman
lived up to her promise and that the

troduced him to his week-old son.
Fourteen-year-old Isaac Blackman
has been sent to the juvenile court to
answer five charges of burglary, and
his father, Morris Blackman, accused
of having stolen poods in his posses
sion, and 17-year-old Thomas , Nee,
charg-ed with burglary, will be ar
raigned In Judge Mogan's court to
morrow. Blackman senior and the two
boys accompanied a peddler's wagon
through the streets of the Western Ad
dition, and the police say that the ped
dling 'was merely a blind to enable the
trio to obtain admittance to dwellings
and steal. Much miscellaneous prop
erty which has been identified by per
sons from whom it was stolen was
found in Blackman's house.
Ella Bishop, a comely young woman,
denied Patrolman W. F. Kruger's
charge that she was a vagrant when
he found her loitering on Fourth street
at 1 o'clock yesterday morning. She
said she was a working girl and could
bring witnesses from Stockton to prove
that the policeman had blundered when
he deprived her of personal freedom.
â¢Judge Fritz has given her until to-day
to make good her claim.
There are four distinct charges of
burglary against Fred Moller, the com
plainants being John M. Reynolds of
1213 Liiguna street. D. Bernstein of 17CS
Sutter street. Mary Golden of 2355. Pine
street and Mrs. C. J. McCollum of 615
Hayes street. "I guess I'm up against
it," said Mr. .Moller when the accusa
tions were read to him in Judgo Mo
gan's court, and then he considerately
offered to waive preliminary examina
tion and take his sentence from the
upper court. He will be formally sent
there next Saturday.
"Gimme a hamburger sandwich, an'
make it rare," said James E. Watkins
(colored) to an itinerant caterer at
Fourth and Market streets. When the
sandwich was presented to Mr. Wat
kins he found that it had been cooked
almost to a crisp, and then he disturbed
the peace and was arrested. Judge
Fritz dismissed the complaint, opining
that as the defendant was prepared to
pay for the sandwich he had a right to
insist on having It fried so as to com
ply with his instruction to the chef.
"One colored man wearing a baby
blue sweater" was how the bench war
rant read that Judge Mogan Issued for
the arrest of James Jackson, who failed
to appear and answer a charge of bi
cycle stealing.
Kate Leddy, an aged woman who
broke windows on Howard street, near
Sixth, has been adjudged insane by the
Lunacy Commissioners and will be sent
to the Stockton aylum. She has a ma
nia for smashing glass.
. â¢
Xg Sam, who stole an opium pipe
from a compatriot, was sentenced to
six months' imprisonment by Judge
Fritz.
Judge Cabaniss is working overtime
to have his calendar cleared ere he
starts to-morrow for a vacation rest in
the Sierras. Among the cases disposed
of by him yesterday was that of S. C.
W'etzel, the piano virtuoso, who robbed
the guests of the Hotel Richelieu. He
is held to the Superior Court in $4000
bonds. Noah Warwick, a soldier, who
tried to cut a comrade's throat, is held
in $1000.
It looks like the maximum penalty
for "Kid" Nash when he is sentenced
next Saturday on two convictions of
peace disturbance and one of va
grancy. Several weeks ago he was ar
rested and booked for disturbing the
peace and vagrancy on complain of
Hose Decker, whom he had threatened
to kill because she had transferred her
affections to a rival, and when the cast*
was heard Judge Mogan discharged
him on condition that he immediately
depart for Chicago. A few nights aft
erward he was caught concealed in an
apartment-house and booked for bur
glary, but the charge was reduced to
peace disturbance after he had proved"
that the object of his nocturnal visit to
the place was to call upon a young
woman. For breaking the promise to
the court that secured his release he is
likely to get as long a period of im
prisonment as the statutes prescribe
for his recorded offenses.
A homily on feminine curiosity was
addressed by Judge Mogan to three
youn# women employes of the People's
Laundry who spent the morning among
the spectators on the benches. The
fair trio had appeared a few days pre
viously as witnesses in the case of
Charles W. Elchelberg, charged with
disturbing the peace, and they were
then told that It would not be neces
sary for them to return. But return
they did. and when his Honor was no
tified of their presence he said things
that they did not seem to relish. He In
cidentally alluded to the saline fate of
Lot's wife, and also cited the, trouble
which Mrs. Fatlma Bluebeard had
brought upon herself by indulging the
penchant for prying which, he opined,
is a lamentable weakness of an other
wise admirable sex. Ere the lecture
â¢was concluded the laundresses three
had retired to the corridor, where
Bailiff Hickey found them and again
declared, with due emphasis, that the
remainder of the Eichelberg case can
be disposed of without their aid.
In language equally picturesque Sig
nor Frediani contradicted et*.Â»ry word
of the accusation. Judge Mogan has
both statements under advisement.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
People have no idea how
crude and cruel soap can be.
It takes off dirt. So far,
so good; but what else does
it do.
It cuts the skin and frets
the under-skin; makes red-
ness and roughness and
leads to worse. Not soap,
but the alkali in it
Pears' Soap has no free, al-
kali in it. It neither reddens
nor roughens the skin. It re-
sponds to water instantly; wash-
es and rinses off in a twinkling; is
as gentle as strong; and the
after-effect is every way good.

AS a matter of course all addresses delivered", at
Mohonk conference on international arbitra
tion were infused by a cheerful and almost a
glowing optimism. That fact to a large extent weakens
their value when judged from the standpoint of reason.
It does hot. however, destroy their value . altogether.
Some of them were made by men. of â¢suchiwell balanced
minds that no optimism could betray them into a blind
enthusiasm for any cause whatever, and . as a conse
quence will be found encouraging even to those friends
of international peace who are least sanguine of seeing
it realized in any measurable time.
The address of Judge George Gray, for example, was
by no means that of a mere dreamer "of dreams. In the
course of his busy life he has had a long and varied ex
perience in dealing with large international issues. In
addition to his service as United States Senator from
Delaware, he served as a member of tnc Peace Commis

INTERNATIONAL .ARBITRATION.
Attention Is called to the fact by the
Washington Post that next month (July.
20) ' the prohibition imposed by The
Hague conference upon the discharge
of aerial torpedoes from balloons or
flying machines will expire by limita
tion. It was with the greatest difficulty
that the powers represented at The
Hague conference, through their mili
tary delegates, managed to reach an
agreement upon rules governing war,
and this particular section was bitterly
fought over, although It is one of the
few which the United States Govern
ment accepted without reservation.
At the end of July a new field' -will
thus be open to the Inventor of flying
PTiachlnes and dirigible balloons, which
may now enter the field of warfare
without violation of the rules of war.

their strenuous activities to the trade of fighting. These^

THE BOERS â Subscriber, City. Tha
Boers in the South African republic
were agricultural people prior to the
Boer-British war. The year* before
that war there were In the republic
about 12,245 farms, of which 3636
belonged tÂ» the Government, 1612 to
outside owners and companies and the
rest to resident owners and companies.
It was estimated that there were about
50.000 acres of land under cultivation.
The agricultural produce was, how
ever, not sufficient for the wants of the
population.
Several people that cannot plead ignorance of the
city and its ways have -found it convenient to sleep in
the ferry building and have awakened to' the discovery
that they were robbed. They should be arrested and
prosecuted for contributory negligence in the commis
sion of acts that have a tendency to injure the fair fame
of the town. Any one that will sleep in a public place
should be able to accept the consequences with com
posure.
With a flourish of trumpets and much official ado the
police raided a Chinese gambling house recently and
carted gamblers and paraphernalia off to jail. This is
an excellent beginning in the worvhy work of reform.
If somebody will how point out to the police a few of
the gambling- dens operated in contemptuous publicity
by white men in this city we may all have a chance to
congratulate the police on well directed activity.
EMPEROR NORTON â Subscriber.
City. Joshua A. Norton, who was one
of the characters of San Francisco of
the early days, generally known as
Emperor Norton, died of apoplexy at
the corner of California and Dupont
streets January 10, 1880. He was a
native of England, about 65 years of
age. His .remains were burled in the
Masonic Cemetery.
There are about 6000 miles of rail
way In Greater London, and it Is es
timated that something like 600,000.

passengers annually. The number of
Journeys on an average weekday is
over 1,500,000. An idea of the vehicu
lar traffic in the streets may be gath
ered from the statement that in twelve
hours 16,054 vehicles of all kinds
passed a particular spot in Piccadilly,
and a full service of 690 "buses pass
the Bank of England in an hour. The
number of passengers carried by the
London trams In a year Is over 300,
000,000. A census taken of the num
ber of pedestrians who crossed London
bridge on a certain day showed that
they totaled 116,902, and In nineteen

The English have-been Â»the rulers of
India, or a large part of it, for a cen
tury at least; yet there are only 232,
388 persons In the Indian empire who
can speak the English language. This
number, compared with the total pop
ulation, may be called infinitesimal.
There are 147 languages recorded In the
census as being spoken to-day In the
whale country, but twenty-five of them,
which are spoken by 221,lii7,673 per
sons, are closely allied members of the
Aryan sub-family. Nowhere is a non-
Aryan tongue superseding an Aryan
one^-and it sheuld also be noted that
the classical Sanscrit, for. many cen
turies has been profoundly influencing
the modern vernaculars. The transla
tion of "Ramayana," one of India's
great epics, into a dialect called
Dwadhi, by a* native scholar who lived
at the time of Shakespeare, is now
"the one Bible of 90,000,000 people."
Among the many Indian languages,
It Is pointed out In the census reports,
there are some with great literatures
and vocabularies, rivaling In richness
the English, French or German. While
some, too, have no past, others have
lived 3000 years. It is not easy to be
lieve, in view of these facts, that the
English language will ever occupy the
field In the Indian empire. Certainly,
It must take an exceedingly long time
for it to drive out the richer native
forms of speech.

Is Leopold Insane?
Is - King Leopold becoming mentally
unbalanced? And will it be necessary
for the Belgian Government to Insti
tute a regency and to Intrust the sov

ular Count of Flanders? That Is a ques
tion which Is being asked to-day, not
alone at Brussels, but in the various
Kuropean capital?, and which is a mat
ter of no little concern to the State De
partment at Washington. For the

diating without any reason the agree
ment made in his name and by his ex
plicit orders with the American con
cessionaires of the Canton-Hankow
Railroad by his plenipotentiaries, ex-
Minlster de Voider and Colonel Thys,
has not only led these two gentlemen
to sever their connection with his busi
ness enterprises, but has likewise re
sulted in an "international incident"
between himself and the United States
Government. For the latter has no in
tention of permitting him to carry out
what apoears to be his project of con
verting Into a monopoly of his own this
essentially American enterprise in
China and of ousting therefrom by un
fair means the American syndicate to
which, on the strength of the recom
mendation of the State Department,
the concession was granted. It Is no
doubt partly due to this that the Bel
gian Envoy at Washington has made
arrangements to spend the summer
within easy reach of the national capi
tal. King Leopold has also quarreled
with the directors of the Congo Rail
road to such an extent that they have
all resigned, among the number being
Baron de Gofllnet. who is treasurer of
the royal household, and Count A.
d'Oulireinont. brother of the grand
master of the court. Finally, the King
is reported to have quarreled violently

pers of Brussels and Antwerp. Princess

The inference from the doctor's ad
dress is that the phrase, as quoted. Is
contained in that immortal document.
It Is surprising that a man of Dr. Gun
saulus' attainments should so blunder,
as the phrase, "All men are created
free and equal," does not occur in that
great instrument. The same misquo
tation is frequently made by orators
and writers. The Declaration states:
"We hold these truths to be self-evi
dent; that all men are created equal."
Dr. Gunsaulus seems to apologize for
the breadth of the quotation as he
would have it, bj^ saying: "The decla
ration was the work of an hour of in
tense excitement," which is altogether
an unhistorlcal relation. Jefferson
probably did not build better than he
knew. As his work was writ, so let it
stand and be read forever more.
L. G. MOISE.
Editor of The Call â Dear Sir: In
the Issue of the 13th in the news of that
date telegraphed from Chicago there
appeared a statement that Dr. Frank
W. Gunsaulus in his baccalaureate ad
dress to the graduating class of the
Armour Institute said: "There never
was a more interesting falsehood than
'All men are created free and equal.* "
That Is not so wide of the mark, but
he went on to say: "The Declaration
of Independence was the work of an
hour of intense excitement and on
every national anniversary this phrase
Is misquoted because when it is taken
from its context it Is false."
SAN FRANCISCO, June 15
A Communication.
THE Confederate memorial service in honor of the
anniversary of. the birth of Jefferson Davis, held
at NashviHe on Tuesday, was attended by a large
number of the Confederate veteran soldiers. The recent
observance throughout the North of the National Me
morial day was generally made the occasion of high
ascription to the valor and devotion of the Confederate
soldiers.
It is a matter of soldierly honor and self-respect to
give due credit to the other side. The soldiers of the
Union overcame men and mighty men when they won
the victory in that long war. The* vanquished were
overcome by men and mighty men by whom it was no
disgrace to be 4 conquered. This feeling was among the
of both sides \vhen the war ended. Its opposite
was sometimes expresred by embittered civilians. Seen
in perspective those hard days and hard battles are now
entered in history as evidence of American valor, and
spirit, and soldiers and civilians have come to the same
view. At ihe Nashville memorial General Stephen D.
Lee, who is the historian of the Confederate veterans'
organization, expressed the joy of the South in the great
and general prosperity of the country, "exceeding that
of Qtir fathers" and putting "the South on her feet
again."
Jn this hearty expression is food for reflection. The
South is drinking deep of a prosperity exceeding any
thing her people knew under the institution of slavery.
We venture to say that if slavery were still there this de
gree of prosperity would not be there, and this seemi
to be understood by the people.
The orator of the day. declared sectionalism to be
"dead and buried." He pictured the great destiny of
America, and the joyful determination of the South to
Â¦do her full part in the "opportunities, responsibilities,
strenuous" conflicts, conquests and glory of the country.";
That is said in the. right American spirit and is earnestly
reciprocated i" the Nor^h. There is no separate fortune
nor misfortune for any part of the republic. The pros
i pcrity is for all, and progress and happiness cannot
touch one alone. So misfortune and disaster, when they
come, are for all. Therefore, all should work together
in those things which ftiake for the material welfare, as
all must suffer if the general'welfare fail. -.'

The night was intensely dark, the
tea extremely rough, and the tempera
ture so low that the rain turned to Joe
as it fell on the decks and rigging. In
fact, conditions generally were bo very
unfavorable that it was considered un
wise to 8ttempt to Iowt a boat and
thereby imperil an entire small boat's
crew on such a dubious quest. After
a somewhat prolonged detention an
order for '"full speed ahead" caused
the old Fhip to resume her struggles
against adverse v.inds and waves.
At a general muster and roll call of
passengers on the following morning
it was ascertained that one of them,
named Ah Loy,. was missing, and an
entry to that effect was made in the
chip's log book. Soon after the com
pletion of the above mentioned muster
a sailor happened to enter the store
room, situated in The forward part of
the starboard paddiebox. and "while
doing a loaf" casually glanced through
a small opening in the bulkhead and
watched the revolutions of the paddle
wheel. While trying to peer through
the fast falling showers of spray and
loam he saw, but qui^e indistinctly, an
object somewhat resembling a human
being lying on the opposite paddle
beam. The discovery of such an ob
ject in an almost inaccessible position

About the middle of January, 1S76,

China sailed from Hongkong for San
Francisco with several saloon passen

the steerage. Like other ships of Etm

By means of a vaporizer this liquid is

tormentors grew more and more im
portunate, and one of them, more ma
levolent than Us fellows, insisted that
he could only atone for his sins of
omission by casting himself into the
sea. After enduring the distressing
mental tortures for several nights, he
decided that if needs must it were bet
ter to make this atonement quickly, so,
yielding to an impulsive obsession,
plunged into the sea. Instead of sink
ing instantly, he vaguely realized that
he was being carried away on the sur
face of a huge wave until drawn into
a whirling mass of waters, where, after
being tossed about until exhausted, he
was thrown upon the refuge already
described.
Completely bewildered and exhausted
by his struggles, he had no sooner de
cided to rest quietly and wait the turn
of events than he hazily realized that
his resting place was beginning to
move and that he was being deluged
by icy torrents; then a helpless be-*
numbing reeling of extreme coldness
overcame him, and he passed .into a
state of complete unconsciousness.
To account for Ah Loy's marvelous
escape from drowning, and from being
crushed by that enormous paddle
wheel, and also by what mysterious in
voluntary method he gained his ref
uge, a place quite Inaccessible while
the paddle wheel was In motion, sev
eral theories have been advanced.
The hypothesis most commonly ac
cepted by seafaring men is, briefly, as
follows: The China was moving slowly
against a heavy head sea when the
man Jumped overboard, and that he
was instantly caught in the swirl of a
cross sea. which carried him backward
"alongside" the ship until he reached
the wheel, when suddenly meeting an
opposing sea, or back wash resulting
from the sudden arrest of the paddle
wheel, he was thrown up under the
paddle box and landed on the paddle
beam, where he was afterward found.
On the arrival of the China in Ban
Francisco about three weeks later Ah
Loy, having fully recovered, was per
mitted to land with his fellow passen
gers. About two years later, when I
chanced to see him, he told me that of
late all had been well with him; in fact,
as soon as he had earned and sent
enough money to China to give, his
mother a burial in keeping with her
station In life, his nights had been
passed in peaceful repose, entirely free
from those terrifying obsessions that
formerly oppressed him.
MILAN SOULB.
San Francisco, May 27. 1904.
If he enter the Cabinet/ his power to'benefit California,
without abating anything due to the rest of the country,
will be vastly enlarged. It is greatly honorable ' to the
Third District that it has made such excellent 'selections
for its Representatives that they are chosen as the only
Cabinet officers the State has had, selected by the Pres
ident. If called upon now to select a new Representative,
we are sure the same wisdom will be' shbwn by the
party there. As any nominee can be â¢elected, the party
shows great intelligence in putting aside the temptation
to nominate any one below the hig'h grade of McKenna
and Metcalf. Republicans of the rest of the State do
not look with envy upon the good fortune of the Third
District, but rather are inclined to'keep.on following the
good example set by the party therei
THE news from Washington seems to' make it cer
tain that California will have the Secretaryship oi
Commerce and Labor, provided Hon. Victor Met
calt, Representative from the Third District, will con
clude to leave his seat in Congress to enter the Cabinet.
While his district and the State will regret to be de
prived of his services in the House, the whole State will
be gratified by representation in the Cabinet, and espe
cially if he be the representative.
California has not fared well in Cabinet representation.
It was expected that we would have a member of Pres
ident Harrison's Cabinet, but unfortunate divisions arose s
between the friends, respectively, of Hon. M. M. EsCee"
and Hon. John F. Swift, and neither was chosen.
Either one of those gentlemen would have made a cred
itable and useful adviser to the President, but our tend
ency to divide and oppose, which was- then at its height,
kept the State in the background.-
When Mr. Cleveland was elected the second time it
was confidently expected that he would choose a Cabi
net officer from this State. So strong was this feeling
that Oregon and other .Western States formally sup
ported the appointment of some one from California.
But the Democracy of the State- was riven its whole
length by the feuds and factions that originated in the
famous Stockton convention of 1884, and it was found
impossible to unite on any man. Mr. Cleveland got no
farther West than Nebraska in making his Cabinet se
lections, and the State was again seated on the stool of
repentance with a dull thud. When President McKinley
was elected he took the reins in his own hands and ap
pointed his old personal friend and fellow* member of
the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McKenna, to the
Attorney Generalship, and afterward, in the face of an
energetic opposition, transferred him to the Supreme i
bench.
The Republican party of'California has learned much
since 1889. and is at present distinguished bj r a stronger
unity and sense of cohesion and a common purpose
than 'ever before in its history. It has. learned that the
source of power in the popular branch of Congress is
in getting good Representatives and keeping them there
while they are willing to serve and stay. If they be
long to the majority of the House, of course their in
fluence is progressive, and each is able to do for his
immediate constituency the things needful, and when
each constituency is well served the whole State is
cared for, as far as it needs care in national legislation.
San Francisco dropped out of line at the last election
by defeating two experienced Republican members and
sending two new members of the minority. These faile'd
to attend to the great interests of this city, and we lost
much. Not content with inattention to their own dis
tricts, one of the minority members went outside and
defeated, by objecting, the measures of his Democratic
colleague in the Napa district, so that we had the ex
asperating experience of three districts losing their
rights through sending three raw members of the mi
nority who put in their time fighting each other. Â»
Fortunately the Republicans learned wisdom. They
put McKenna into Congress and kept him there until
his contacts and influence were strong enough to make
him Circuit Judge, transfer him to the Cabinet and thence
to the Supreme Bench. His old district soon took up
Mr. Metcalf and has kept him in the House * since, his
entry in the Fifty-sixth Congress. He has achieved a
place on the Committee of Ways and Means, a position
in which the revenues and commerce of the country are
cared for in legislation. To be an active member of
that committee is to be in the most important of parlia
mentary relations to the Government and the interests
of the people. To. be a member of that committee is an
honor equal to the chairmanship of any other committee
of the House. Men are chosen to it on their merit, as
judged by the leaders of the two parties on the floor.
The minority leader, who is the candidate of his party
for the Speakerphip, selects the minority members of
the Ways and Means Committee, and his successful t
opponent, the Speaker, appoints them. The Speaker,
in turn, selects the members of his own party for the
majority of that great committee. These selections
being upon merit and capacity solely, it is the highest
evidence that can be. given that Mr. Metcalf is^ in the
first class in the House.
CALIFORNIA IN THE CABINET.
After reviewing; the whole subject Judge .Gray said:
"The establishment and continued existence of the per
manent Court of International Arbitration will make it
more difficult in the future than it has been in the past
for nations to engage in war. I believe that its influence
will grow slowly but steadily and that each resort to
its decisions will tend to form and strengthen the habit
of looking thitherward to settle international difficulties
by an appeal to reason instead of by an appeal to arms."
. An equally important utterance on the subject was thai
of Dr. Trueblood/ secretary of the Peace Society, who
after citing the Venezuelan arbitration and the Alaskan
award, recounted the treaties of arbitration concluded
between Great Britain and France, France and Italy,
Great Britain and Italy, Holland and Denmark, Great
Britain and Spain,; France and Spain and France and
Holland. He concluded by saying:
"The movement which led to these treaties has not
yet spent itself. France is in negotiation with a number
of other. Governments, some of them in South America,
for similar agreements. Within the last month it has
become known that Norway has commenced negotia
tions for arbitration treaties with no less than ten Gov
ernments. It is known that several of the powers of
Western Europe have approached our Government with
proposals for treaties of arbitration similar to those al
ready concluded in Europe."
Facts of that kind count for something. They show
that despite the armaments of the nations and the wars
now going on the tendency of civilization is toward
peace. Already the effects of that tendency are notable
and it is reasonable, to expect they will be even more
notable in the future. >
an international issue we may be sure his arguments are
well considered and his conclusions well founded. It is,
therefore, gratifying that his address was not only a
pica for peace but a statement of a firm conviction that
it'is quite likely to be attained at no far distant time.

A delegation of 500 constituents and
admirers of Ruef, forming four
abreast and headed by a band and
several automobiles, got into line at
the' St. Francis Hotel about 10 a. m.
The column with police at the head,
band playing and flags flying, marched
down Geary street to Stockton and
thence to Market. The route down
Market street was lined with people,
but asÂ» friends of AbeÂ»Ruef only car
ried one emblem, a floral horseshoe
inscribed "Our Leader," many of the
spectators did not know the meaning
of the celebration. At the ferry the
parade was reviewed by Mayor
.Schmitz and Fire Commissioners
Boyne, Parry and Maestretti. The band
and the crowd went aboard the boat
and contributed to the Jollity of the
occasion. The Berkeley was moving
out of the slip when a commotion at
the apron was noted. Then it was ob
served that E. C. Lefflngwell, Election
Commissioner, and Supervisor Lun
stedt were on shore. The boat was
backed up and the two tardy office
holders were tossed by the police over
the heads of the throng and placed
safely aboard the steamer. And the
band played on. At the mole Ruef
was "it." He made a short speech
from the rear end of the last car on
the train. -He proposed three cheers
for the Republican delegates and
three cheers for Theodore Roosevelt.
These were heartily given and the
crowd threw in three for Mayor
Schmitz. A little crowd on the side
track tossed out three for Parry and
the colt.
Engine No. 3016, with Engineer
Charles Thomas at the lever, pulled
the Republican special train from
Oakland mole to Sacramento. Con
ductor Lou Martin shouted "all
aboard" at 11:35 a. m. yesterday. The
train consisted of a regular baggage
car. a composite car; a small diner,
No. 10,009; a compartment car and
three superb Pullman coaches. 1 The
train is lighted throughout by elec
tricity. A banner bearing the words
â¢California for Roosevelt" and at
tached to'composite car No. 3076 is
the only outward sign that the train
is the special conveyance of the Cal
ifornia delegation to the National Re
publican Convention.
There was the usual send-off at the
Oakland mole, but the absence of a
large throng of party leaders was not
ed. This was no doubt due to the
disinclination of many leading Re
publicans to identify themselves with
the Ruef demonstration. It was men
tioned at the mole that the "hurrah"
for Ruef in particular did not com
mend him to the special favor of the
rest pf the delegation. It was, how
ever, taken into account that Ruef
was about to leave the State for his
first Journey beyond the borders of
California and the incident was soon
overlooked.
The reception of the delegates that
came in on the train by the Sacramen
tans was as warm as their climate and
the degree of this is superlative.
Truckee was left behind at 8:40 p. m.
and the little city of Reno, after put
ting the Nevada delegates aboard,
waved good-by at 9:45 o'clock.
The desert with its hot winds and
dust is ahead, but with Secretary
Steppacher. the lord and master of two
porters and the wine car, there is little
to /ear from the wastes of alkali.
At every station along the route a
crowd had gathered to wave flags and
cheer. The people of Sacramento,
which city was reached at 2:05 o'clock
this afternoon, had turned out in force.
A brass band crashed and blared fare
well to Governor Pardee and the other
delegates.
Mr. Ruef Is willing to accept the of
fice of national committeeman and
canvassed the situation to a limited
degree, but his friends among the dele
gates eay he will yield to the wishes of
those that favor Knight and there will
be no contest. Judge J. \V. McKinley
of Los Angeles was spoken of, but he
declined the honor.
M. A. Gunst, delegate from the
Fourth District, has his eye on an of
fice he believes he can fill to the satis
faction of all. He seeks to be Califor
nia's representative on the committee
that will formally notify President
Roosevelt of his nomination. So far
these are the most important questions
of a political nature to be discussed by
the delegates.
Delegates from south .of Tehachapi
admit that San Francisco is entitled
to the. national committeeman and In
all probability George A. Knight will
be called upon to accept the ofllce at
the meeting of the delegation to be
held at the headquarters in the Audi
torium, Chicago, next Monday at
10 a. m.
An enthusiastic farewell from San
Francisco citizens and cordial greet
ings from citizens along' the route have
served to animate the more the buoy
ant spirits of the delegates and their
guests. Weary from the - exertions of
their preparations for the trip to Chi
cago, the women of the party were
willing to rest as soon as they boarded
the train, but the delegates, anxious to
settle bothering questions of politics,
were sodn grouped in the drawing
rooms and smoker engaged in discus
sion.
ON BOARD THE CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION'S SPECIAL TRAIN,
RENO, Nev., June 15. â The California
delegation to the Republican National
Convention has traversed "\he Golden
State and now speeds eastward across
the silver land.
BY F. W. BISHOP.
Staff Correspondent of The Call.
Commissioner J. A. Pilcher started
eastward to return to the exposition
last evening. He will stop off at Au
burn to meet Mrs. Filcher and Miss
Filcher, who will accompany him to
St. Louis to remain during the season.
Mr. Filcher said Just before starting
last evening thaf he had succeeded in
arranging several matters that brought
him to California. The Governor has
accepted the invitation to the reception
at St. Louis that was tendered to him
by the commissioners. The time select
ed for the* reception will be most oppor
tune, says Mr. Filcher, for there will
not then be a plethora of functions and
of dignitaries to be received on the ex
position grounds.
Concerning his mission to California,
Mr. Filcher said that It was principally
in connection with the making of ar
rangements for a dally supply of fresh
deciduous California fruits from this
time to the close of the exposition sea
son. He was satisfied that the plan
has been perfected for this desirable
feature of the horticultural display, and
it Is certain that a splendid array of
fruits is needed to do credit to the
State. California has practically no
competition in this line.
A special rate has been arranged by
the express companies of $3 50 pev 100
pounds of fresh deciduous fruit* from
California to the exposition grounds.
One hundred pounds means five twen
ty-pound boxes of fruit. Any commu
nity or any individual grower of fruit
would readily put up a few boxes of
fruit and pay $3 50 in express charges
to help make a good show at St. Louis.
Governor Pardee will visit the St.
Louis Exposition after the National Re
publican Convention is ended. He will
be tendered a reception In the Califor
nia State building on the exposition
grounds by the California commission
ers. He will also reside for some days
in the California building as the guest
of the California commission. At the
reception in his houor will be assem
bled the officials of the exposition, the
commisioners from all the States rep
resented at the big show and other dig
nitaries. Altogether the Governor will
have opportunities for a very enjoyable
time and will have a chance to per
sonally inspect all the California ex
hibits.
DURANT, I. T., June 15. â The In
dian Territory Democratic convention
to select six delegates to the national
convention will convene here to-mor
row. Conservative leaders say that
the convention will send an unin
structed delegation to St. Louis.
Will Send an I T nlnÂ«Â«tructed Delegation.
Immediately preceding the hearing
of the contests to-morrow the recom
mendation of the sub-committee hav
ing in charge the matter of seating
the Porto Rican delegates will be
heard. A sub-committee which has in
charge matters relating to , disfran
chisements of the negro will also make
its report.
In the absence of Postmaster Gen
eral Henry C. Payne, chairman of the
national committee, who was unable
to be present on ciccount of illness,
Senator N. B. Scott of West Virginia
presided. Commltteemen fronf Idaho,
Washington, Arizona and Hawaii were
represented by proxies, and those from
Montana, Oregon, Utah and New Mex
ico were not present.
Scores of delegates to the convention
arrived during the day and night.
Postmaster General Henry C. Payne,
chairman of the committee, collapsed
at the Auditorium Annex to-day.
Payne has not been in good health
for some time. He recently took an
ocean trip for purposes of recupera
tion. He was in his room when the at
tack came. His ailment was of a
neurasthenic character. . *
Those opposed to the Governor,
among whom are Senators Spooner
and Quarles and Representative Jo
seph W. Babcock, chairman of the Re
publican Congressional Committee,
were also here to-day.
The contest, If it is heard by the
committee at all, may not be taken
up until Friday, but some of the mem
bers are understood to have concluded
to exclude both delegations and let
the courts determine the rights of the
two factions. *
Resolutions of respect to the mem
ory of the late chairman of the com
mittee. United States Senato^r Hanna,
and United States Senator Quay, a
former member and former chairman
of the committee, were adopted.
After deciding that the contests on
delegates at large and district dele
gates from the various States shall be
heard in executive session, each side
to be given thirty minutes for the
presentation of arguments, the com
mittee adjourned until to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock. The contests
will be considered in alphabetical or
der, Delaware coming first.
The matter of contested delega
tions is centered largely in the fight in
Wisconsin, in which State two fac
tions have elected delegates at large.
The supporters of Governor Lafollette
of Wisconsin arrived to-day and were
prepared to present their side of the
controversy.
CHICAGO. June 15. â Preliminary
to a more extended meeting to-mor
row, when a number of contests will
be heard, some of which' /may be
brought before the 'National Republi
can Convention Tuesday, the national
committee met this afternoon in Its
rooms in the Coliseum.
George A. Knight Is Men
tioned for Nationaj
Committeeman.
Ruef Demonstration De
ters Great Party Lead
ers From Scene.
Despite the admonitions of the court
the afternoon was passed in going over
ground already covered by other wit
nesses with an occasional quibble be
tween attorneys. The case will be re
sumed to-day.
He was then, as former witnesses
have been, asked a series of questions
regarding the location of the ware
houses at Crockett and Port Costa,
whether he rode or walked when Jour
neying from one to the other and If
so. why.
Gove stated positively that he had
teen the wheat on which the Eppinger
concern borrowed money in April of
1903, loaded on the. French bark Pierre
Lotl in December of 1902. He identi
fied the particular grain by the lot
number* on the sacks.
On the other hand the witness also,
<Â»n cross-examination, testified that it
wai customary to substitute lots of
wheat, the quantity and quality being
alone considered. The instance of lot
709 being taken for 710 was cited and
the witness said he remembered the
occurrence and that the substitution
was made to save truckage and re
piling.
This was considered a point for the
prosecution, as Bunker's book Ehows
a record of quantly and quality of
prain in the warehouse as reported by
the deputy inspectors from day to day.
By it the prosecution seeks to show
conclusively that the grain on* which
the firm of Eppinger & Co. borrowed
money in April, 1903. had been shipped
from the warehouse in December, 1902.
On direct, examination District At
torney Bylngton asked the witness if
he would comcare his memoranda with
the book made out by Bunker and
could swear that it was correct, to
which Gove replied in the affirmative.
In the trial of Jacob Kppinser,
charged viiih obtaining money under
false pretenses. Judge Lawlor made an
important ruling when he decided that
a witness might refresh his memory
from data not in his own handwriting,
providing he was positive it was com
piled from his own notes. Judge Law-
Jur. in making the ruling, paid tha* as
the witness. Bunker, had testified the
items enumerated in his book were
copied from memoranda furnished him
by Deput> Inspectors Gove and
McAvoj and the witness Gove had
compared his memoranda with the
items in Bunker's book and made cor
rections, he might refer to the book
at will.

NEW YORK. June 15.â A small field
of the finest thoroughbreds will strug
gle to-morrow at Sheepshead Bay for*
the* blue ribbon of the Eastern turf, thÂ»
$20,000 Suburban handicap, at one and
a quarter miles. So evenly balanced
are the chances of the candidates In
the twenty-first running of this classic
event that even the most expert opin
ions as to the probable result are val
ueless. An adjustment of weights
made for to-morrow's event will decide
more equitably the merits of the first
four horses in the Brooklyn handicap,
won by The Picket, and if that splen
did racer repeats his victory to-morrow
he will have to extend himself to the
utmost.
Confidence of the Eastern turfmen isÂ»
supreme In. the belief that The Picket
will be unable to repeat and Irish Lad
will go to the post the public favorite,
as he was in the handicap. Hermis.
from the stable of Edward R. Thomas.
Is In grand form, as was demonstrated
when he won the Brookdale at Graves
end yesterday, almost equaling the
track record for one mile and a fur
long. This victory cost the son of Her
mence an added pound to his Impost
for the Suburban, but he will not feel
the change, as he is a good weight
carrier.
Proper, which finished third* in the
Brooklyn, will again carry the silk of
"W. B. Jennings of California. He will
be ridden by George Odom instead of
Lucien Lyne, and his owner expressed
the belief that he will do better than
third. While Proper's work In prep
aration for the Suburban has been ex
cellent, professional handicappers do
not agree with the Jennings prediction.
Africander's chances are considered
slim. He won the Suburban last year
on a muddy track. This year his form
has not been so good at any time.
There is every indication the race will
be run over a fast track. The probable
starters are:

Yanger Cannot Fight for Month?.
SALT LAKE CITY. Utah, June 15.â
As a result of his fight with Aurejio
Herrera at Butte Monday night, Benny
Yanger, the Chicago feather-weight,
will probably not , be able to use a
glove for at least six months. The
knockout blow Yanger received 'from
Herrera's right in. the eighth round
lifted him off his feet and ! he fell
with a crash on his Â¦ right shoulder.
The ring was unpadded-and the liga
ments of Yanger's shoulder were'bad

will be examined under an X-ray ap
paratus to determine the exact extent
of the injury.

ST. LOUIS TEAM PROFITS
BY HITS AND A FUMBLE
TACOMA, June 15. â San Francisco
played its initial game to-day, beating
the Tigers, who put up a miserable
fielding game. Overall pitched good
ball. His passes were bunched with
errors and timely hits, and Uncle
Henry had no trouble packing the
victory into Â¦ his grip. Chlmmie de
Whale was behind the gun and he
kept the hits scattered, although the
Tigers hit for extra bases.
Uncle's team made a hit in Ta
coma. A large crowd greeted them
and they played star ball. "Rab
bit" Miller showed up well. Hilde
brand made a splendid catch off the
fence. The visitors profited by every
error, and although the Tigers made
three double plays they could not
keep down the scoring. Sheehan
made a double play unassisted.

. Special Dispatch to The Call
CHICAGO.' June 15. â In a common
exercise gallop English Lad, the
American Derby favorite, won the
Derby Trial at Harlem to-day, making
the balance of his field look cheap.
.Lonsdale gained .many admirers by
running a good second,, with El wood,
at 30 to 1, third and coming fast.
English Lad, for the first time this
year, received a. perfect ride,- the colt
having Dominick- up to-day. Dominick
rated him cleverly the first half, avoid
ing all interference. English Lad
moved up to Lonsdale on the far turn,
took command at the head of the
stretch and won as though x out for
morning exercise. . ,
The big colt waa loudly cheered as
he returned to the judges' stand after
his victory. English Lad was always
an odds-on choice. He was backed
from 11 to 10 to llto,20, and the
money fairly poured in on him. The
time, 2:08 2-5, was slow, and' English
Lad could have run it a second faster
if urged.
Horsemen are unanimous in their
opinion that English Lad, Moharib,
Fort Hunter and Highball must be the
only candidates considered on Satur
day. . . "
The steeplechase handicap fur
nished a 50 to 1 shot winner in Miss
Brandon. In some books she was as
good as 100 to 1 and several wagers
were made at these odds. After tak
ing the last jump Handvise, the fa
vorite, got to the front for a few sec
onds, but in the run to the wire Miss
Brandon caught the first choice and
won, goinp-away, by two lengths. Five
of the eight starters finished,
f The track was fast this afternoon,
Hut rain threatened throughout the
day. An excellent card of seven races
and the last appearance of English
Lad before the Derby drew out one of
the largest crowds of the present
meeting, which ends Friday. Sum

ORAVESEND, June 16. â Oraves
end'a spring meeting was brought to
a dose to-day. The only feature was
the Myrtle Stakes, w"hich was won by
Sheriff Bell, under terrific punishment
by "Tommy" Burns. The latter was
forced to do hi* strongest riding* to
get his mount up in front of Flam
mula, which had made the running
in company with Unmasked.
Buttons, off last, raa in that posi
tion or near It for the first half-mile,
then began to close on those in front.
Embarrassment, sold to J. W. Gibbon
et auction two hours before the race,
fell lame during the and was
far behind the placed horses at 'the
finish.
Agile should have won the two
year-old handicap, as she was soingr
easily at the v last : furlong: poet, but
soon after that Philip J. Dwyer's col
ors on Red Friar came strong, and
Helgreson was forced -to betfn riding
Agile. It was too late to save . the
race, however, and after a short de
lay the judges announced it a dead
heat between Aelle and Red Friar.
The last named was coming so fast
that he might have won outright in
the next gtride. It is so long since
Mr. Dwyer has won a race that his
friends hoped he had secured this, but
the verdict was a dead heat. Under
the rules of racing a dead heat be
tween two-year-olds cannot be run
off. so the purse was divided. It
the fractional time of this race was
correct the first quarter was run
faster than any other quarter at this
meeting. The stewards cautioned
Helgeson for reckless riding soon after
the start. Summaries:

PORTLAND, Ore., June 15. â By a
4 to 2 >. score Dugdale's men defeated
the baseball aggregation from Oak
land that followed them up from the
south. , Swats werex much In evidence.
Ten times Â¦ was Ike Butler touched
up, while George Cooper allowed nine
off his delivery. Two of the latter
were two baggers. The scoring, how
ever, was .confined to the first, two
innings. In the fourth Butler saved
his team "touch anxiety when he
fielded Brick Devereaux's bounder to
Castro in time to . stop Moskiman.
Castro caught Brick at first and the
trick was done.. Jake. Thielman had
a chance at a -double play unassisted
when he-nailed Franck's short fly to
right field ten feet front first, but he
tossed the ball to Beck and divided
the honors. .
Francks robbed. Castro . of a hit
when he captured a line drive that
sizzled . when it . struck . his . mitt.
Brown,, the new umpire, seemed to
give entire satisfaction. Score:

STANDING OF TUB CLUBS.
As usual, Andy Gallagher was saved
till the last. Andy commenced to work
the miner out at a lively pace. For his
pains he received a few Jolty boys on
the point that made him look unhappy
every now and then. This was tho
fastest round of the day and the miner
showed to marked advantage.
He took on Jack Sullivan first and
then went at Joe Long. Both these
men got theirs while mixing.it with
Jack, especially Long, who received a
Jolt' on the Jaw that all but put him to
the realm of dreams. Then Ivan Mc-
Laughlin came up and he fared even
worse than Long. The big miner hit
his sparring partner so hard that he
commenced to bleed badly and Trainer
Tim McGrath was forced to call time.
Frank McConnell tried his band at
feinting out the â big fellow. ; Frank
fought cleverly, but at that he did not
show Munroe up in the Â¦ least. Jack
seemed to be familiar with every trick
and once he forgot and hit the welter
a mean wallop on the Jaw that sent
him staggering back. Jack Cordell, the
lightweight, went a round at feinting
with the big fellow, but no blows were
struck.
Jeffries was told that his knee must
have absolute rest for six days, during
which time he will be confined to his
bed. Nature is expected to work won
ders in this time in reducing the swell
ing, owing to the perfect state of Jef
fries' health consequent upon his weeks
of training.
The rumor was rife yesterday that
the Yosemite Ciub management de
spaired of Jeffries rounding into condi
tion and that the fight might be de
clared off. Manager Coffroth vigorously
denied this last night. "I am going up
to Harbin on Friday," he said, "and I
will satisfy myself as to Jeffries' con
dition. I am also going to try to in
duce him to, come down to Oakland,
where the persons interested in the
fight can keep in touch v.ith him. From
the reports I have received from Billy
Delaney I see no reason why Jeffries
should not round into form by the last
day of this month, when the fight is to
take place."
De Witt Van Court, the clever boxing
instructor of the Olympic Club, and
an authority on training, is of the opin
ion that the enforced rest will do Jef
fries no harm. "Jeffries is such a hard
worker that the rest will really benefit
him," he said yesterday. "He is not
likely to take on much weight and a
few days' exercise would bring him
around again and fit him for his ap
pearance in the ring."
Jack Munroe resumed boxing yester
day afternoon after a day's rest and
he worked out fast. "Four heavy
weights and two lighter men felt the
force of the husky miner's blows. He
also varied the programme a little by
punching the bags.
Dr. Devening, who is attending
Champion Jeffries at Harbin Springe,
adopted heroic treatment yesterday on
the big fellow's injured knee, lancing
the swelling. There was only a slight
discharge of mucus, hardly as much as
was expected from the size of the
swelling.
After lancing the injured knee the
leg was bandaged tightly from the foot
to the thigh. Dr. Devening will remove
this bandage to-day to note what 'pro
gress has been made in the healing
process.

CHICAGO, June 15.â Secretary James
E. Howard of the Washington Park
Club destroyed all the hopes of the
bookmakers to-day by declaring em
phatically that no Rambling 1 would be
tolerated at Washington Park on Derby
day. Any person found making a
wager will be ejected from the grounds
by detectives employed for that pur
pose by the park officials, he declared.
"It doesn't seem necessary for us to
forbid gambling." said Howard to As
sistant Chief Scheuttler when he was
given official notice that no gambling
would be permitted at the great turf
classic. "You seem to have looked well
to that, but we have issued orders that
no bookmaking nor gambling of any
kind can be indulged in at Washington
Park this year. Detectives have been
employed by the association, and any
one who is found making bets will be
ejected from the grounds immediately."
This declaration followed the Mayor's
ultimatum of an hour before, when he
threatened to revoke the amusement li
cense of the association if It allowed
gambling at the track.

UOSBSCXS BAIJK HOI-LISWOOD. WHICH WAS SPOKEX OFF THIS PORT OX MAY 23 AXD SUPPLIED WITH PRO
VISIONS CY THE RARK PRUSSIA.
Other affidavits were read to show
the value of the company's property
and the mistakes which had been made
In putting upon the plant the valua
tion which the company claimed.''
The company intends to introduce
several mo.re affidavits this morning
and then proceed with the argument.
According to stipulation each side will
be allowed two hours In which to pre
sent Its side, after which the matter
will be taken under advisement.
At the afternoon session a lengthy
affidavit was presented, with the signa
ture of Mayor OIney attached. That
document went into the political sig
nificance of the application for the in
junction, and also the value of the
property of the company.
The company claimed that the city
had not fixed the rates at the time it
should have done so. The city claimed
the Council was ready to fix- the rates
in February, but the company failed
to furnish the facts asked for, and on
that account it was impossible to take
action until the latter part of May.
Affidavits were submitted by mem
bers of the City Council to show that
all the data obtainable by the Coun
cil was considered when the rates were
fixed and that there was no guesswork
in connection with the conclusion
reached.
. POLITICS INCLUDED.
The contention that the City Council
had been the cause of the drop In the
price of the company's stock was de
nied. It was claimed by the city that
there had been a great increase in the
consumption of water since the law of
1902 fixed the rates, and that the com
pany had almost doubled its number of
patron3.
The complaint also said that due al
lowance was not made by the Council
in fixing the rates for operating ex
penses. In response to that the city pre-
; f nted an itemized account of expenses
â¢vhich the company included in its
â¢.'laim as costs of maintenance, which
had Included such Items as funerals,
receptions, decorations and carriage
hire In such numbers that the court
asked that the lump sum be named
and thÂ« Items left for consideration
later. McEnerney said such institu
tions were called upon to contribute to
such affairs Just as much as they were
to pay debts, and he could see no rea
son why they should not be charged to
operating expenses.
PUBLIC NOT PHILANTHROPISTS.
Mr. Davis took the ground that there
was no reason why the public should
be used to keep up the company's phil
anthropic reputation. It was not the
amount involved, but the principle. At
the same time the amount upon which
the city would have to base its fixing
of the rates would be Increased In the
aggregate.
When the case was adjourned Thurs
day it was understood that the city of
Oakland would be allowed to present
affidavits on Wednesday to establish
an answer to those presented by the
company. When the case was called
yesterday morning Attorney Davis for
the city read the answer to the com
plaint fiTed by the company. The an
swer was a general denial of the com
plaint, and quoted figures relative to
the revenue of the company, to which
Mr. MeEnerner objected, but his objec
tion was overruled. The complaint
claimed a valuation of $S,5OQ.OOO, while
the city had accepted the figures pre
sented by experts and had fixed the
water rates on a valuation of $4,000,000.
DEW STOCK PRICES.
Attorneys for the Contra Costa Water
Company and those for the city of Oak
land in the suit for an interlocutory
injunction to restrain the bay city from
putting into effect the water rates es
tablished by the City Council must
complete their work to-day, for Judge
Gilbert of the United States Court of
Appeals will leave for his home in
Portland to-night and desires to hear
all the facts before his departure. With
that understanding each side will be
limited to two hours to-day for the
presentation of arguments.
"My opinion is that the Algoa had
too much starboard helm and that la
why she went ashore. The rocks were
on the starboard bow when we let go
the port anchor."
The investigation will be resumed at
10:30 o'clock this morning.
Courtenay W. C. I. E. Bennett, Con
sul General for Great Britain and Ire
land at this port, yesterday began an'
investigation into the causes which led
to the grounding of th^ British steam
er Algoa on Point Bonita on the morn
ins of June 7.
Albert Lockett, master of the Algoa,
testified that shortly before the ship
struck he rang the engineer to "stand
by" to avoid the danger of a col
lision with a bark that waa be
ing towed out to sea by the
tug Reliance. As the vessel would not
lose headway fast enough to go out
straight without striking the bark he
ordered the helm put to starboard to
pass astern of her, and then he put the
helm hard a-port so as to meet her
and enter the channel on the running
tide. But the tide caught the ship on
the starboard bow and her head
swung fast to port. He then let go the
starboard anchor to check her head
from swinging to port, which it did.
At the same time the engines were put
full speed ahead. The anchor carried
away and First Mate Andrew Nelson,
seeing it go, let go the port anchor
without orders, thereby checking the
ship's head from swinging clear, hÂ«
not seeing that the ship would have
come clear. At the time ' the ship
struck the rock there were thirty fath
oms of water on the port anchor. All
hla orders to the engine-room, he, said,
were faithfully and promptly carried
out. and the Chinese crew behaved ad
mirably.
Third Officer William M. Lloyd said
that he thought the captain made a
mistake when he gave the order "hard
a-stacboard." At that time the witness
heard the captain say something about
the bark that was being towed out of
the harbor and stamped, his foot. Then
the ship took a sudden sheer and
struck, notwithstanding the captain's
later order of "hard a-port." /
Charles Thomas Stein, a quartermas
ter, swore that when the order^ "hard
a-starboard" was given It was to get
out of the way of the bark that was
being towed.
Charle3 L. Patterson, second mate,
testified that a mate would never let
a ship go ashore with the anchor on
the bow.

CLAIRVOYANTS â Contlnnrri.
FROM ALL SECTIONS THEY COME TO
WITNESS THE WONDKRFUL DEMON-
STRATIONS of the NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
For a reliable -.and Intellleent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE. 42S Kddy st.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
HUtrgest the remedy.
He Is as conspicuous for hlÂ§ wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he Is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness. - - .
Would It not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be reKeved of the matters that
are troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with b<Uer success?

The Ministers of the Porte, after bar
ing decided that Turkey should not ba
represented at the St. Louis exposition,
were influenced to change their de
cision when the following facts werÂ»
submitted: Since the establishing o2
direct steamship service Datween New
York and Turkish ports freight rates
have been reduced from $3 73 to U 15
a ton: the value of Turkish imports ta
the United States has increased from
$4,000,000 to J5.CW.C0O per annum, and
the United States is buying from Tur

The water committee, of which Trus
tee, W. J. â¢ Martin is, chairman, has
taken the matter up and the dispute
must be adjusted or legal entangle
ments will result. The water com
pany has been shutting off the supply
from various customers without any
notice being given. These consumers
were thus deprived of any water for
drinking or cooking purposes.
The matter, has assumed such alarm
ing proportions that a special meeting
was called. The water committee con
vened, the full Board of Trustees
and a large number of citizens being
present. It was virtually an indigna
tion meeting. Many of the water con
sumers who claimed to have been ill
treated, were most vehement In their
denunciation of. the corporation.
A petition, signed by eighteen heads
of families, numbering in all .seventy
seven consumers, was presented. This
petition set forth the grievances. They
were in substance: That the Bay Land
and Water Company . had on June 5
shut the supply off from the petition
ers' homes for a period of twenty-four
hours without giving any notice to
consumers of its intention.
The petition called forth animated
discussion.
SAUSALITO, Jtine 13.â The. Bay

llto and the Board of Trustees are at
outs. As a result most restrictive or
dinances will be passed by the board
unless the corporation discontinue cer
tain practices with their consumers.

Mr. Nolan had acquired a great rep
utation for tact, so that when Mr. Cas
sidy fell from a ladder and broke his
leg it was quickly decided bv all the
workmen that Mr. Nolan should bear
the tidings to Mrs. Cassldy.
"He broke the news gradual." said
Mr. Leahy to his wife that night, "and
by th<t time she learned the truth she)
was as calm as a clock, they say. Oh,
he's a great man, is Tlmmy Nolan!"
"How did he do it?" - asked Mrs.
Leahy, impatiently.
"Like this." said Mr. Nolan's ad
mirer. "He wlnt to the house and rang
the bell, and he says: 'Thin Dinnia 1Â»
not dead, Mrs. Cassidy, or you'd nivir
be so gay lookin'.
" 'Dead!' she screeches. "Who said
he was dead?*
â¢â¢ 'Thin it's not thrue he's near to
dyin* wld the smallpox, either,' said
Timmy, 'or you'd nivlr be lookin* so
amazed.'
" 'Smallpox!' she cries. 'HaÂ» he got
the smallpox. Tlmmy Nolan, and been
tuk to the hospital widout mÂ© sayln'
good-by to him?"
" 'Sure, an* he had not.' said Tlmmy
Nolan in a comfortln' tone. 'It's only
that he's broken a few bones In hla
leÂ£, fallln' from a ladder, and Fra sint
ahead wld the news.'
" 'It's vou that's a thruÂ© friend, an*
you've lifted a big load from me heart,*
said Mrs. Cassldy. and she gave him a
warm shake to his hand and wlnt back
to her washin'."â Youth's Companion.

Dads." Commissioner J. S. Parry
started out to respond to the toast,
"The Ladies," and after throwing to
them a large amount of brilliant and
glorious bouquets, he suddenly shifted
away from the subject and began to
tell a few stories of what he knew
about the Fire Department.
Dr. W. A. Harvey had a whole lot
to say about the Board of Health, and

plored the fact that no appropriations

BOYXE TALKS.
H. M. Wreden, the newly appointed
Fire Commissioner, was the recipient
of a handsome banauet at the Claren
don HoteMast night, tendered to him
by his many friends. It came to him
as a surprise. The entertainment was
a royal one in every way. , The long
table, laden with magnificent floral of
ferings, was only an accessory to the
Epeeches of congratulation and good
cheer that came from his friends as
sembled around the festive board.
Thomas A. Keogh was toastmaster
of the evening. Hln genial countenance,
coupled with his effervescent spirit of
good fellowship, directed the entertain
ment on to a complete and successful
issue. The spread was superb and was
accompanied by sparkling wines of the
finest vintage. After the menu had
been thoroughly discussed, speech
making becamo the order of the even
ing.
Mayor Schmitz, who sat at the right
hand of the guest of honor, spoke in
his happiest vein. His "efforts," he
said, had always been for the welfare
and the progression of out great com
monwealth. His aim was to make the
municipality the greatest that floated
under the stars and stripes.
The new superior general was born
June 27, 1839, in London, England,
though his parents were Americans.
When he was only a few months of
age his family returned to this coun
try and during his youth he attended
the Brookline, Mass.. High School,
from which he entered Harvard Uni
versity in 1853. Four years later he
graduated with very high honors.
After graduation he did astronomi
cal work at the Dudley Observatory.
Albany. N. T., and at the Harvard
Observatory, and in 1868 he entered
the Paulist community and was or
dained a priest in 1871.
Father Searle was a friend of the
late Admiral Sampson of tha United
States navy and suggested to him tha
plan of a range finder, which has
since led to the invention by a naval
officer of an Instrument of great prac
tical use.
This honor was not unexpected. In
asmuch as Father Searla is the old
est living member of the Paulist or
d^r and has for many years occupied
a prominent position In the society.
Father Searle Is not only prominent
as a superior and priest, but is well
known in the scientific world for hl3
work in astronomical research.
He was Invited by tha late PopÂ«
Leo XIII to accept an appointment at
the Vatican, but on account of work
in which he was engaged in the Unit
ed States he felt compelled to decline)
the honor.
The Very Rev. Father H. H. "Wey
man. superior and rector of St. Mary's
(Paulist) Church, received a telegram
yesterday announcing: the election by
the Paulist Chapter, which is now In
session In New York City, of the Very
Rev. George M. Searle as superior
general. *
Father Searle had been for the last
eight years first consultor of thÂ« lata
superior general. Father Deshon, and
was elected by the board of consultors
as superior pro tern, after Father De-
Bhon's death.

Current Conditions and the Out- ,
look for the Future.
Ttie New York circular of Henry Clew* sayÂ«:
Â¦Â¦Another uneventful week has pone by. leav. |
ing Wail street in th* same conservative mood
Â»hicri ha* now prevailed f:r Â»etks v aiid months.
If anything, there Is a change for the better;
and the wave of pess;miÂ»m which has long
been hesvlett here is gradunJ'.y giving way t<>
more hopeful views regarding the future. Up
to cate this feeling ha* been more in the na
ture of a conviction that all recent develop
ment* o? an unfavorable character have be*n
Hiryily discounted so far as the stock market
is concerned, and that no good reasons exist
for any further decline. Consequently, reports
of lessened business activity, decreased railroad
â¢"arnings smaller bank clearings, etc. have no
<fTeÂ«t whatever en Stock Exchange valuee; they
rxÂ»!ong M the p***. Wall street generally being
m.*t Interested in the future and but sligluly
concerned with the present. *
"Attention now is almost entirely centered
upon tfce crop*. These arr- generally progress
ing satisfactorily, the only complaints being
c( backwardness In some regions and Injury to
winter wheat. Very sor-n harvesting DC the
latter Â»t!l b**in, and then other crops will
fnliow In quick succession. Another two
months will practically tettle the crop prob
lem, and should the prospects continue fa
voiaMe Â»e may anticipate a general revival
Â«ij confidence, while on the other hand ar.y
r<*al disaster to the crops this year will have
a much # raore injurious effect upon business
ihan the corn failure exÂ«rted in 1902. when
oar industrial boom was in full swing and dM
<nuch to counteract that disaster.
MONETARY CONDITIONS.
Â¦Â¦Monetary conditions, it must be admitted,
art generally favorable to letter prices for
s-tocks. Loanable funds are jientlful, and gold
*xrÂ«rts have been checked by the fact â¢ that
foreign demands eeera satisfied for the present.
The Bank of France holds an unprecedented
rvittr of gold, -while the Bank tt England's
rÂ«>erve has risen to a point where a reduc
tion in the bank rate teems possible. - There
is therefore much less Inducement to ehlp gold
In sjiite of <Â«ir large supply and redundant
batik currency, which, of course, facilitate ex
ports. It would cause no sunrise if Europe
FhouM n:ake further calis upon us: still, two
of the nort important factors in the export
rr;rvvcmenl â the Panama canal and the Japa
nese war payments â are now out of the way.
â¢iii'1 these fscls Irss^-n the reasons for gold
Â«hipmÂ«TitK. Other hindrances to gold shipments
â¢ 111 also romc into play ort- long. Crop d<
ir.an.1s will b<-yin: first for winter uhÂ»at, :
Â»h'ch usually develops in the isst half of June. {
and next for cotton, the movement of which
sJwÂ«ya calls fto largt shipments of currency !
tn the South from New York. Then Â»ill fol
low the dcman-is for sprinR -wh^at. corn. etc.
. It is UFC-':e*s to expect the Pouth or rhÂ«* West
W to meet tbeac demands unaided. Balances now
fcel.i hem av.d FWllinc <5rÂ»os:ts will be drawn
dov.n and we will inevitably witness tho usual
ritain Tor crop ru 1 "!' 05 "* 8 uj>on this center not
Â¦withMnn<1ir.|T the oft-repeated assurances that
the West and South can take care of them
â¢elrea. The bacfcwnr<i and forward flow of
r-urrency to points whore it will do the tn-Â»r
Â«-rvice and secure the best returns is as
natural and a* certain as the tides of the
ocean and payÂ» equally slight regard to pride
of location or r.atiora.lity. The monetsry sit
uation as a whole is satisfactory' aside from
the possibility o' Â¦ Treasury deficit and the
operation of a redundant bank currency, which,
in times of stress, would material:}* encourage
told exports.
'â¢One of the most depressing features if the
condition of the Iron trade and the growin'T
supplies of pigiron In the face o' curtaied pro
duction. Still another discouragernnnt Is the
labor situation and the deplorable state of an
archy which exists in certain parts of Colorado.
Â¦"Tl-.e outlook of the market is toward still
further Improvement. Values resrKjnd readily
to good news, and there is neither disposition
nor necessity for selling desirable sÂ«-cur.tie>.
A* before eald. the tig men are not likely to
assume very aggressive, leadership ur.til the
n-xlts of crops and Presidential nominations
tre known. As for the Russo-Japanese war.
,t has no Immediate pronounced influence on
iricee."

NEW YORK. June 15. â The heavy demand
for Union Pacific, which developed yesterday
before tbe market clos-4. was .conspicuously In
evidence- again this morning and was supple
mentf-d by sympathetic strength In Southern
Pacific. ThÂ» movement >n the stocks domln
atc-.l the whole market and the news devel
opments regarding them were taken to explain
the recent movement of the market In kci.
Â«ral, *â¢> that pome realizing in the general
list fo'.'.owed th* day's news. The early sur
mis-f over the ground of the heevy dealings
in the Vaolflo covered a wifle range, including
a Southern Pacific refunding scheme and an
Incidental settlement of the whole controversy
over the transcontinental ilel-l of railroading.
The more definite formulation of the reports
dashed the" speculative ardor, especially that
of Southern Pacific holders. The reports were
without explicit official sanction, but credence
was given tt thise pointing to a determination
to provide for an Issue of (100.000.000 of
Southern Pacific preferred stocks with 7 per
tent dividend privileges, the proceeds to be
used for retiring the floating indebtedness of
:h* Southern Pacific Company and for ether
purpoxrs. Of the total amount authorized th*
immediate Issue of $40,000,000 of the preferred
ktock was said to be Intended. On the pub
lication of the plan the Southern Pacific ran
off sharply under very heavy offerings.
Its weakness and the Intermittent strength of
Union Pacific kept the market unsettled and
confused for the rest of the day. There was
a lnrp* shrinkage In the volume of dealings
r.t anr.thi-r cenwquencr. Union Pacific's
strength followed from the fact that a large
part of Southern Pacific's floating Indebtedness
'Js to Un!on Pacific, for v.hlch the plan pro
vides rÂ»:-lniJ>ursenient. Southern Pacific's weak
ness was due to the unpleasant ImpresRion
cauÂ».-Â«d by a large Issue of preferred -stock
ahead of the present stock. The termination
of the strike of vessel men on the Lakes helped
on the early firmness In the market. There
was some heaviness in the coalers from the
outset and they were Tather prominent In the
later v.x-akneFs with the repetition' of rumors
of Fitlcra- proceedings aFMinst the coal com
bination. The fnrrign trade statement for
May sh-wed the larg* falling off In exports <.t
domestic products partly mitigated by the to
tnl expert figures, but ai. accompanying in
crease in the imports reduced, the trade bal
ance^n our favor for thp month to $9,293,847,
romjAred with $21.Kfl4.4.'>4 for May of last
yenr. A transfer through tha xubtreasury by
telegraph of $l..'Â«''0.00rt to San Francisco is be
lieved to represent the proceeds of the Jap
Â»;n<*s* Iuan trÂ» pay for Japanese Government
purchar.es en the Pacific Coast. Bankers con-'
nested with the loan are emphatic In the as
sertion that net one dollar of the proceeds of
the lo.tr. Is destined to find Its way back to
Jar-*n. The selling to realize In Ihe latter
par', of the day left the day's changes on the
si<V of the losses. *

good absorption continued In evidence. Total

"We have ascertained that the recent Gov
ernment bid for 4000 tons of hay will be let
In San Francisco. It Is not expected that
much benefit will be derived from it. for de
liveries will be taken In rather small Install
ments throughout the next two or three months-.
Prices continue practically unchanged, but
just as soon as we get Into the new crop
there will surely be a considerable decline
from the present range. Some little activity
In sections south of us has been noted, due to
the fact that many of the Southern Califor
nia dealers have been making purchases
throughout the Ean Joaquln â¢ Valley. To the
north of us a large crop will be harvested, and
It looks as thouch prices might rule rather
low when some of it begins to seek a market
within a month or two from now."

Hay dealers reported yesterday that It was
now definitely known that the San Francisco
market would secure the Government 'Manila
order for the 3876 tons, but It would have
no effect on- the market. aÂ« It was to b-y
strung along over a long period of time â from
now until October. The market showed no
change. A car of choice new wheat Hay came
In from Contra Costa County and a cargo of
new Alfalfa from the river, neither lot being
placed on the, market.
Feedstuffs remain firm at previous quota
tions.
Â¦ The circular of Somers & Co. says:
"Hay shipments have been somewhat on the
Increase during the past week, for the total
shows 2600 tons, an increase of 500 tons over
the week preceding. For some little time past
arrivals by water have be,en rather light, av
eraging 6 or 7 cargoes per week. The record
for the last six days,- however, shows a total
of 14 cargoes.' which is responsible for the
Increase In receipts. Everything arriving by
water has been Â«ld crop hay with the excep
tion of twfc cargoes of new first-cutting Al
falfa from up river. These graded only as
stock hay and f<o!d In the neighborhood of
$7 per ton. By rail practically everything has
been old crop hay, although during the week
two or three cars of poor Volunteer have ar
rived, together with two or three cars of fair
quality wheat hay. The former sold for $7
per ton, whllcÂ«on the latter but $10 per ton
was offered, althouch more was asked. Gen
erally speaking, matters are very quiet with us.
Enough old hay seems to be coming to supply
the demand, and no one seems Inclined to take
any Interest In the new crop as yet. We do
not anticipate much activity In this line until
about Â«.te 1st of July.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Trade In the fruit market was quite active
on local account, and a good demand was
noted for shipment to nearby towns and Hono
lulu. Flno lets of Cherries, suitably packed
for export, were very scarce and cleaned tip
quickly, and occasional sales of extras were
reported at a substantial advance over the
quotations'. Loose Cherries were firmer for
good sound lots, but poor and soft stock
dragged and could be had in the afternoon
at easy figures. Longworth Strawberries were
dull and lower; as the previous high prices,
together with the poor quality of the berries,
checked the demand. Everything else In the
berry line was quoted steady. Currants did
better under light receipts, and the market
was practically bare at the close. Figs con
tinued to arrive rather freely and sold from
?1 t.-> $2 25 per box. as to size of package, and
Seedless Grapes were in fair request at HÂ®
1 50 per crate. Small tree fruits, such as
Apricots. Peaches and Plums, were In ample

CHICAGO, June 15. â For the first half of
the session sentiment in the wheat pit was
bearish and prices were a trifle lower than
yesterday's closing figures. Initial quotations
for July were down '/s&VjC to %@%c at 84%Â©
84%c. During the early hours the volume of
trading was small. On account of heavy rains
In the Southwest, which will interfere with
harvest operations, there was lack of selling
pressure. A good export demand was the
chief feature that -added strength to the situa
tion during the last part of the day. The tone
at the close was firm. After jelling atS5VfeC
July closed at S5c.
A general commission-house demand with
only moderate offerings caused flrmne?s in
corn. The market closed near thÂ« high point.
July opened at 4fS%Q48',ic and closed at 4S%c.
Oats were steady. With the trading almost
entirely In the September option. July opened
at .'{U'/jc and closed at 39%c.
Provisions were easy at the start, due to
liberal receipts of hogs and to lower prices
at the yard*, but sentiment soon changed to
firmness on actlv e demand from shorts. Most
of the gain wan subsequently lost on heavy
selling by packers. The market closed at
about yesterday's final figures, September pork
being up 5c at $12 65. Lard was unchanged
at f6 90 and ribs were up 2%c at $7 33.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

In spite of the heavy receipts Butter seems
to' pass out of receivers* hands readily, and I
while stocks are large there Is no accumula- ;
tlon. Storing of the surplus Is still going on 1
freely. Prices are unchanged. The estab- j
llshment of evaporated cream and condensed
milk plants 'here and there on the Pacific
Coast is having some effect on the output of
Cheese, and the ultimate result of this new
feature of the dairy trade Is causing some |
discussion among dealers. Several already re- !
port a resultant falling off In the Cheese out
put in one or two Important districts.
While the feeling in Eggs Is weak, it Js
not sufficiently so to Justify any marked de
cline In quotations. Some dealers are letting i
their ranch goods go at 21Â©22c to keep their j
stccks down, while others â¢ still report 23c |
Stocks however, are large, and the tendency j
Is to sell, especially as free offerings of East
ern are beginning to tell on the market.

Harrison's circular says: "Since the steam
ship Sonoma left there have been no arrivals
of coal from any Australian ports, yet. 5'.rgu
lar to say. thÂ«re appears no apparent urgent
requirement for. colonial coal, although theTe
Is no excessive amount here In yard. There
are four cargoes fully due here to arrive from
Australia with about 8O0O tons, but aa thÂ«
coal on each of these vessels Is specially adapt
ed for domestic purposes, it is not in Immedi
ate demand, as the sals for household pur
poses at this season of the year is very light.
There are forty-one vessels on the engaged
list for the carriage of ccal from Australia,
their aggregate carrying capacity being abcut
105,000 tons. As about 75 per cent of this
coal will not arrive for several months hence.
It will probably come to a fairly profitable mar
ket, as tt Is exclusively a fuel suitable for
household purposes. Coals mined in Australia
specially adapted for steam purposes are UablÂ»
to come to an unprofitable market for several
months to come, as they have to come la direct
competition with British Columbia and Wash
ington coals which are being landed here at
prioes with which they . cannot possibly com
pete. Prices remain unchanged, although
slight concessions are being made for round .
lots. The volume of business la extremely
light, and complaints are very general about
the small quantities changing hands; the
present asking rates of freight oa grain car
riers are exceedingly low, with a dismal out
look for any Improvement In the near future.
This will not prove very seductive to coal car
riers from Australia seeking this port for
profitable business."

critical condition as a result of the
v/ounds Inflicted by Adolph Goldman
in a Post-street hotel on Monday

that Snow will recover if bipod pois

still confined in the City Prison and
appears to have regained his self
control.
It is the opinion of the medical men
that it will be one week at least before
the wounded man can be declared out
of danger.
In the meantime Snow is resting
easily. His daughter is a constant
watcher at his bedside.
Goldman appears to realize the se
rious predicament in which he is
placed. His emotional feelings seem
to have deserted him and gloom has
settled upon the unfortunate man.

McCook boy was standing in the yard
;:.nd Ballinger was on a porch about
twenty-five feet from the ground.
There was a pile of bricks on the
porch and Ballinger began to throw
them into the yard. One of them
struck McCook on the head and he
was found unconscious by his mother.
He was pent to the Clara Barton Hos
pital, where an operation was per
formed on his fractured skull, and the

Items that may be vetoed altogether
include $1475 for paying premiums on
bonds of the Auditor, Treasurer, Sher
iff, Tax Collector and County Clerk on
the ground that no discrimination
should be made infhe matter; $6000 for
Assessor's additional clerks; $6000 for
five extra deputies in the Recorder's
office; $1800 for telephone operators in
the City Hall; $1000 for purchase of law
books for municipal offices on the
ground that the money has heretofore
been taken from the urgent necessity
fund; $7500 for a convenience station;
$7500 for new elevator, and $7400 for
special appropriation for new. furniture
in offices of Recorder, Supervisors, As
sessor, County Clerk and Law, Library;
tinting and painting Recorder's and
Assessor's offices, $1550.
MAY BE VETOED.
A municipal tax rate of $1 03 would
be the lowest since the charter went
into effect. In 1901 it was $1.0762; in
1902, $1.2262, including the special levy
for schools and hospital of 15 . cents,
since declared illegal by the Supreme
Court, and in lf-03, $1,076.
In order to effect a reduction in the
city tax rate of 4 cents, exclusive of the
13.53 cents for bonds, it will be neces
sary for the Mayor to veto appropria
tions aggregating $200,000. The follow
ing are among the items upon which
the Mayor may use the pruning knife:
For expenses connected with the ac
quirement of public utilities, reduced
from $5000 to $2500; on the ground that
the work before the committee does not
warrant the higher outlay; stenogra
pher, $1200; for lighting the public
streets reduced from $320,000 to $275,000
in accordance with his veto of last
year; for auxiliary water supply sys
tem cut from $150,000 to $75,000; for ex
penses of Finance Committee for ex
perting municipal accounts from $10,
000 to $2500.
The Mayor is somewhat undecided as
to the propriety of cutting out the ap
propriation of $628,336 for the bond is
sue for improvements on the ground
that the validity of the issue is still
undecided. Should he do so, and his
veto is sustained by four Supervisors,
it will result in a further cut of 13.53
cents in the tax rate, thus making the
levy $1 03 instead of $1.2053, a decrease
of 17.53 cents.
LOWEST TAX RATE.
In making his recommendations for
the elimination of specific appropria
tions and the reduction of others
deemed by him as ill-advised and un
necessary, the Mayor says he has been
guided entirely by a desire to reduce
the city tax rate of, $1.2053 which the
expenditures provided for by the Su
pervisors necessarily entails. He is
of the opinion that at least 4 cents can
be cut from the levy for municipal ex
penses.
Mayor Schmitz- has practically com
pleted his proposed vetoes of certain
items in the municipal budget recently
passed by the Board of Supervisors and
will transmit his message on the sub
ject to the board either to-day or to
morrow.
"When the old Spaniard died George
Urioste filed the first will and applied
for letters of administration, but . the
will was rejected by the court when it
was discovered tliat a later one was in
existence. It was then that George de
Urioste is said to have written to Mrs.
Cristobal, suggesting to her that he ap
pear as her personal representative
here in the 1 settlement of the estate,
of which she was to receive a quarter.
Recalling her father's friendship for the
Uriostes, she consented, notwithstand
ing that a legal representative had been
engaged to further the Interests of her
mother abd herself In the probating of
the will. A few weeks ago, after- the
will had been probated and the estate
ordered sold in order to facilitate the
distribution, if is claimed that George
de Urioste notified Mrs. Cristobal in
Barcelona that his fee for services
would be $15,000, of which $5000 was to
go to Lawyer Paige for legal work.
Failing to refedily appreciate the
value of the services claimed to have
been rendered by De Urioste. especially
in view of the fact that other attor
neys were claiming fees for the same
services, Miguel Cristobal, after con
ferring with his attorneys In Spain,
hurriedly crossed the Atlantic and this
continent to this city to look Into the
matter personally. When he arrived
here the property had been sold,' and he
found the court preparing to con'flrm
the sale and award the claims of the
various attorneys concerned in the dis
tribution of the estate, which is valued
at $738,500. While not particularly anx
ious to discuss the purpose of his hur
ried visit to this city, Cristobal re
luctantly admitted yesterday that he
had so far failed to find adequate rea
sons why the old friend of his father
in-law, George de Urioste. had made
such a high demand for services, but he
added that possibly the matter may be
adjusted after he and Urioste have had
a better understanding with each other.
Miguel Cristobal of Barcelona, Spain,
son-in-law of the late Jose Guardlola,
whose estate was sold in this city last
week at public auction, has arrived
here with a view of looking into the
sale. He is at the Palace Hotel, and
admitted yesterday that he will not
permit a confirmation of the probate
sale of last Thursday if he is able to
satisfy his opinion that the properties
disposed of should have brought a
higher figure. Another purpose of Cris
tobal's visit to San Francisco is in con
nection with a fee of $15,000 demanded
by George de Urioste, local Consul Gen
eral for the Argentine republic, for ser
vices alleged to have been rendered in
the settlement of the Guardiola estate.
When Jose Guardiola arrived here
from Guatemala fourteen years ago he
made a will, . in which the brother of
George de Urioste, who was a great
friend of Guardiola, was named as a
beneficiary. Later, however, Guardiola
executed another will. in Spain making
his wife and daughter, who is now the
-wife of Miguel Cristobal, his chief lega
tees.

Anybody can be a Boraxologistâ just
buy a package of BORAX^ â¢ And it's a
significant fact that there are no backslid-
ers among the Borax converts* Once

A person who has taken a Borax
bath doesn't need any further preaching;
the housekeeper who has once used
Borax in the laundry or kitchen doesn't
have to be told again about its value as a
cleanser. Add a little BORAX to the
