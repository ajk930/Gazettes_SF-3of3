tourist named Augustus Pelham, who
If sojourning In Honolulu, says he met
Stanford and party at Assuan,
Egypt, last year He soM an elephant's
to Albert Beverly, the butler, who
was purchasing curios for his em

Mrs. Stanford was at that time In
tant fear that the natives would
rrur<ier her, says Pelham. She would
not leave her room at the hole! and her
meals and everything she needed were
taken to her by the butler. Beverly
told Pelham, according to the tourist's
story, that Mrs. Stanford had him sleep
at the floor of her room and he never
left the post without notifying her and
knowing that she was awake. Miss
Berner, the secretary, was always with
Mrs. Stanford in her room.
Mm. Stanford told the landlord of the
hotel she must leave "because of fear
that the natives would kill her.
Pelham further says Miss Richmond

ehe approached him with a request to
help her change places with come other
maid as she did not wish to remain
longer with Mrs. Stanford.
The tourist declares that the Egyp
tian Gazette In Alexandria published
stories during: Mrs. Stanford's stay at
Cairo in regard to her fears of thÂ«
natives. These were said to have
vanished, ; but she was compelled to
leave the pyramids because ahe saw
visions before the sphinx.
Pelham says that be met the party

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, MARCH 11, 1905.
General Kuropatkin's army is in full flight for the hills back of Mukden. The Russians abandoned great quantities of stores
and many of their big guns. Tie Pass, heavily fortified stronghold, is their objective point. Field Marshal Oyama is still in pursuit
of the Russians, with the object of preventing their arrival at Tie Pass. Should the Russians reach their stronghold they will be a posi
tion to stem the advance of Oyama.

ARMIES, March 10. 1 p. m. via Fusan
(delayed in iraiismilseion). âDuring;
the nijfht General Qku's army ad
vanced almost to the railway, despite a
desperate resistance, occupied Sujaton
Station, the main Russian supply
depot, and captured enormous quan-
tities of supplies, including 6.000,000
rifle cartridges and other supplies in
proportion. The Japanese are not
harrying their movements, being de
termined to lose no chance to make
victory certain and decisive. They are
confident of the success of their plans.
NEWCHWANG, March 10.âAccord
ing to reliable information received
here, the Russians, having been driven
out of Mukden and Fushun and with
the railroad cut, are retreating in a
demoralized condition to the hill coun
try towards the northeast.
Detached bodies of Russians are
roughly entrenching with a view to
checking the pursuit, but no great rear
guard action Is being fought.
It will be impossible for the Russians
to keep any sort of resistance for many
days, as there are no means o-f provis
ioning in the rough country to which
they are retreating.
It is believed that the Russians may
attempt to reach Kirin, 225 miles north
east of Mukden, through the valleys,
but a special Japanese corps from the
direction of the Yalu River (probably
General Kawamura's forces) threatens
to cut them trff.
General Kuroki is advancing north
west and is â¢ forcing the Russians
against General Nogi's army.
ThÂ»- casualties on both sides have
been enormous. The Russian Sixteenth
Army Corps was r practically annihil
ated at Tatchekia'o. Eight thousand
Russians fell at Leukuanpao.
TOKIO, March 10, noon.â lt is un
officially reported that the Russian
strength west of Mukden consists of
two cc-rps. The Japanese, who de
stroyed the railroads, are pressing the
Russians northward, and the portion
of the Japanese center pressing the
Russians northward along the Mukden
road is now engaged six miles north of
the Hun River.
Nearly all the Russian heavy guns
and many field guns have been cap
tured.
RUSH FOR TIE PASS.
The defeated army is now rushing
northward toward Tie Pass, around
which are high hills, which were pre
pared for defense after the battle of
Liaoyang in September, there being no
hope at that time that the Japanese
would allow the defeated army to rest
south of the Tie Pass. That the Rus
sians have lost many men and large
quantities of ammunition and supplies
ia certain, for with a single track rail
way to the north it would be Impos
sible to remove the large stores which
had been gathered together at Muk
den. These, It seems certain, have been
destroyed. The Japanese have not yet
reported the capture of guns, which
they generally do almost immediately,
but it seems hardly likely that Kuro
patkin could have removed all of his
artillery.
Or. the Ist of January, according to
correspondents who have just returned
from Mukden, the Russians had In po
sition along the Shakhe and the Hun
rivers 1500 guns, Including a number
of six and eigl\t inch guns on cement
foundations, straddling the railway
juft north of Shakhe station. In addi
tion, many guns arrived in Mukden
during January and February, so that
the Russian artillery, when the big
battle started, must have numbered
neariy JOOO pieces. It is likely that
Kuropatkin has sacrificed some of
those and is bending all his energies to
extricating his army. That his task Is
a diifioult one all the dispatches Indi
cate, but Russian sympathizers point
to his retreat from Liaoyang, where
conditions were opposed to him.
ROADS ARE FROZEN.
The retreat from Liaoyang waa ac
complished during a terrific rainstorm,
over roads hub deep in mud, while at
the present time the Manchurian roads
are frozen hard as stone and have been
worn as smooth as asphalt by the con
tinual passage of the big wlde-tlred
commissariat wagons. The result of
Oyama's great turning movement de
pends almost entirely upon Kawa
mura's army, which has not yet been
located definitely, although supposed to
be moving from the east toward Kuro
patkin'i line of retreat. Should he
reach the military road, which runs al
most in a direct line from Fushun to Tie
Pats before the passage of the Rus
sian army, the circle will be complete,
as Nogi's guns already command the
railway and should soon control the
Mandarin road, which is but a short
distance east of the railroad and runs
parallel with It.
The army of General Kaulbars, which
has been pressed back across the west
ern plain, fighting every Inch of
ground, is moving northward to pro
tect the line of retreat from the attacks
from the westward, while General Bil
derllng is protecting the rear against
Generals Oku and Nodzu, and LÂ»ine
vltch Is doing his best to hold the
military road against Kuroki. They
have numbers against them, but have
succeeded against odds in similar re
treats before. The appearance of Gen

Captain Burnett's men have beea
working in harmony with the private
detectives. But it is now announced
that the police are still "up in the air."
They are no r.earer a solution of the
mjf.tery than when they began.

His train arrived in Chicago a few

ALL ARE BAD
AS THE RUSSIAN
LONDON, March 10.â Count Tolstoy,
In a letter to the Times of London,
which Vill be published to-morrow
morning, says that he regards not only
the Russian Government, but all Gov
ernments, as "intricate institutions
sanctified by tradition and custom for
the purpose of committing by violence
the most dreadful social crimes." He
therefore thinks the efforts of those
who wish to improve social life should
be directed to the liberation of them
selves "from the Governments, whose
futility in these times is becoming
more and more obvious." This object
could only be attained by the unique
means of religiously and morally per
fecting separate individuals. The Idea
is prevalent that the evil accomplished
by tht "present particularly coarse,
cruel, stupid and deceitful Russian
Government" is due to the fact that
the Russian Government is not organ
ised on the model of other existing
Governments, which "are similar in
stitutions for the committal of all
kinds of crimes against their peoples."
For the purpose of correcting this the
people had used all the means at their
disposal, 'â¢imagining that an alteration
of the external forms might alter the
essence." Tolstoy says:
Such activity is inexpedient and unreason
able, in that the people assert rights which
they oo not have. Violent strife by external
means on th*> j>art of an insignificant handful
of men against a powerful Government de
fending its life is only comical from the point
of view cf the possibility of success and pite
ous at regards the unfortunate misled indi
vidual who perishes in the unequal strife The
Russian Government haa no light to claims
which do not appeal to the great mass of the
people. One hundred millions of the peasan
try noed nothing of these demands, their on*
desire and expectation being the liberation of
the land from the law of property or common
ownership of land, matters which are entirely
ignored In ÃberaJ positions and speeches, and
only incidentally alluded to in the revolu
tionary socialistic programme.
Concerning the representation de
mands, Count Tolstoy says:
The people in great mass still believe In au
tocracy, both by reason of Inertia and because
they think thai only through autocracy and
through the Ciar can they attain this com
mur.alization of land. The present activity is
lr-rnicioue, because it distracts the people from
the moral perft'oting of separate lndiTiduals
whereby only can bÂ« obtained the objects to
ward which those who are fighting the Gov
ernment are striving.
In conclusion Count Tolstoy says
that in America, France, Germany,
Japan and England the pernicious
character of the Governments is so
marked that those belonging to those
nations point to events in Russia and
naively Imagine what is done in Russia
is done only in Russia, while they en
joy complete freedom and need no im
provement of their positions. He adds:
They ar* in the most hopelaea state of slav
eryâthe slavery of slaves who do not undtr>
stand that they are slaves, and pride them
aelves on their position as slaves. The fact Is
Chat every coercive government is in the es
sence a great and unneeessajr evil. Therefore
the aim both of the Russians and of all
mÂ»n schould not be to replace on* form of
government by another, but to free themselves
from every form of government and abolish it

take charge of the case."
HOPED IT WAS NOT MURDER.
"Before we left San Francisco The
Call had very thoroughly 'covered
everything we know In connection with
the mystery," said Dr. Jordan. "I did
not 'think it possible that any one had
attempted to murder Mrs. Stanford at
the time of the poisoning in San Fran
cisco on January 14, but she laid much
stress on the matter. An investigation
; was accordingly instituted, but there
have so far been no tangible results
from the work.
"We have been hoping against hope
that this last poison theory was un
true. It is terrible, terrible. Mrs.
Stanford was such a good woman and
it is horrible to think that her life
should have had such an end.
"I presume the police of Honolulu
will hand over all papers in the case
to Callundan and Reynolds. They are
to take full charge of the investiga
tion.
"Mr. Hopkins and I came here to es
cort the remains of Mrs. Stanford back
to San Francisco. We shait return on
the Alameda*, which sails from Hono
lulu on Wednesday."
"Yes. we know the contents of Mrs.
Stanford's will," answered Dr. Jordan
in reply to a question.
JORDAN SPEAKS EXCITEDLY.
"What about Beverly and Miss Rich
mond? Were they left anything in the
will?"
"No, sir," replied Dr. Jordan emphat
ically. "She would never leave those
people anything, never."
This was the only time Dr. Jordan
showed any signs of excitement.
He said that the reports that Mrs.
Stanford was a spiritualist were un
true. She had told Dr. Jordan that
she hoped there would some day be an
opportunity for scientific research into
psychological matters so that the living
might be placed in communication with
the dead. Mrs. Stanford hoped she
might gain communication with her
husband and son, if it were possible,
so she could be guided by their sug
gestions as to what she should do dur
ing her lifetime.
"I never knew," said Dr. Jordan,
"that Mrs. Stanford was a spiritual
ist as that term goes. With the name
spiritualist I associate masks and other
fancies."
"Is Miss Berner a spiritualist?" was
asked.
"No, I certainly think not. I have
known her the past fifteen years and
am sure she Is not.
"Miss Berner was Mrs. Stanford's
stenographer and secretary and one in
whom Mrs. Stanford reposed the ut
most confidence."
Dr. Jordan concluded the interview
with the statement that the trip from
San Francisco had been a period of
gTeat anxiety for him.

carefully, and as he finished he leaned
back for support against the depot
building and covered his eyes with his
hands and In a voice Quavering: with
emotion, said: "I cannot believe it,
and yet this statement must undoubt
edly be true. I cannot believe it, for
the reason that there is no motive,
no reason for any one to take my
slater's life. She never did any one
harm and her life was devoted to do
ing gofcd. Who could possibly be ad
vantaged by her death? Surely none
of those of her immediate household,
for they would lose their pleasant
situations and good wages.
"| have been criticized for not tak
ing more active steps in trying to look
into the cause of her death. I could
not proceed further than I have done,
for I did not believe that she had died
other than a natural death. I have
waited for the result of the inquest to
be made known. Now, of course, af
fairs assume a different aspect."
W. J. BRYAN ADDRESSES
WISCONSIN LEGISLATURE
MADISON, Wis., March 10.â On In
vitation of both houses Colonel W. J.
Bryan to-day addressed the Wisconsin
Legislature. Governor La Follette was
present. Bryan championed the re
form measures of the State adminis
tration. He characterised Governor La.
Follette as the first and foremost cham
pion of reform in the Republican party
of the United States. The speaker op
posed the influence of corporations
in politics, and he particularly scored
the railroads. He predicted that the
railroads would yet combine with the
Standard Oil Company in Kansas to
put out of business the State oil re
finery. Bryan, however, believed that
Kansas people would then be aroused
to crush the monopolies in that State.

MYSTERY SHROUDS CASE
Illinois Probate Court Finds
Trouble in Establishing
Identity of the Deceased
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 10.â Efforts are
being made in the Probate Court to
unravel the mystery which developed
after the death of the woman known
as Miss Anna Mueller, a teacher of
German in the public schools, also a
student at the University of Chicago.
The disappearance of a will said to
have been executed by the deceased
and a question as to the real name of
deceased complicates the case. It is
believed that she had been masquerad
ing under a wrong cognomen for the
last sixteen years. Miss Mueller con
stantly avoided all reference to her
family. She admitted on more than
one occasion that Mueller was not her
correct name and said that for per
sonal reasons she did not care to give
the name of her parents.
A will Is said to have been executed
about three years ago and by its pro
visions the deceased left her estate to
her parents in Berlin. Another will
was found and by the terms of this
instrument she bequeathed $5000 to
Mathilda Bressler, a milliner living on
Market street, San Francisco, Cal.
This woman has written to Attorney
Cleveland stating that she is the
mother of the young woman.
Attorney Cleveland to-day went be
fore Judge Cutting and filed a petition
asking that the Chicago Title and
Trust Company be appointed adminis
trator of the estate.
WOMEN FOUND
IN POOLROOM
A noolroom in the rear of Jacob
Tuch's cigar store at 581 Geary street
was raided yesterday afternoon by Po
licemen Harrigan and Hooper. Tuch,
the proprietor, and nine women were
arrested and taken to the City Prison.
While they were being booked the wo
men talked excitedly, making com
plaints against the policemen.
Mrs. Foster of the Hotel Repellier and
her two daughters were among those
arrested Mrs. Foster complained vig
orously against what she alleged was
partiality on the part of one of the
policemen. She said that a Mrs. Ber
lin was in the poolroom when it was
raided and the bluecoat walked out
with her. Mrs. Foster further says
that Mrs. Berlin was seen to open
her purse and was heard to say, "I
suppose I can pay my ball now." That
was the last seen of Mra. Berlin and
her name was not entered on the prison
register.
Another woman said the policeman
took hold of her roughly and struck
her on the nose, bleeding it. She show
ed a handkerchief with a few blood
stains on it in proof of her statement.
One of Mrs. Foster's daughters also
complained of being roughly handled.
Most of the women gave fictitious
names. All, with one exception, ad
mitted that they played the races and
could not see why they should be ar
rested for doing po. The exception was
a deaf woman. Mrs. Foster said the
deaf woman Avas a fortune teller and
had nothing to do with pools. The deaf
woman happened to drop in to tell any
of their fortunes while they waited for
the results of the races.
After they were all balled out Mrs.
FoÃter and her daughters complained
to Acting Chief of Police Spillane
against the arresting patrolmen for
partiality and rough treatment. They
were informed that their complaints
would have due attention.

CHADWICK CASE
NEAR ITS END
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 10.âSat
urday will see the close of the present
trial of Mrs. Chadwick and the case
probably will be given to the jury some
time during the afternoon. Just before
adjourning court for the day Judge
Tayler said it was his intention to keep
at the present ease until Jit had been
finished and he directed that all other
court business be postponed until Mon
day morning.
The entire day was given over to ar
guments, half of the total number hav
ing been disposed of. Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Thomas H. Garry spoke
in the morning and Judge Wing for
Mrs. Chadwick took up all the after
noon, with the exception of one-half
hour Just before the adjournment of
court.
This time was taken by J. P. Daw-
I ley, senior counsel for the defense, who
is to deiiver the main argument for
Mrs. Chadwick. After him will come
District Attorney Sullivan, who will
close for the Government. The latter
is not given to extended speeches, but
it is believed that both he and Dawley
will require more time than one session
of the court for all they wish to say.
Assistant District Attorney Garry's
argument at times was disconcerting
to Mrs. Chadwick. Her face was pale
and she kept her handkerchief pressed
against her mouth, while she listened
anxiously to every word he uttered.
I When Garry finished his argument
i Mrs. Chadwick appeared much wor
! ried. Her son, Emile Hoover, who sat
beside her, passed his arm over her
: shoulders as if to comfort her. She
gTaaped his fingers In an agitated man
i ncr and twisted them nervously.

RATE QUESTION
IS DANGEROUS
BOSTON, March 10.â "The Presi
dent's railroad policy" was the general
subject of discussion at a dinner of the
Economic Club of Boston to-night.
The principal speakers were Judge
Peter Grosscup of Chicago, President
David Wilcox of the Delaware and
Hudson Railroad Company and Inter
state Commissioner Charles A. Prouty.
Each commented at length upon
President Roosevelt's views regarding
the regulation of interstate commerce
rates. Prouty defended the proposed
national legislation. Wilcox vigorous
ly opposed the interference of the Gov
ernment in the rate question and de
clared it Impossible for a small body of
men at Washington to properly dictate
what the railroad rates of the country
should be. In conclusion Wilcox said:
The remedy lies in thÂ« vigorous) enforce
ment of existing statutes, whioh will prevent
rebates and discriminations and resort by the
commission directly to the courts without dila
tory preliminaries, so as to secure expeditious
legislation by the only branch of the Govern
ment which is qualified to administer Justice
and determine rights of property.
Judge Grosscup said that he saw se
rious danger in the whole question un
less it was handled delicately not only
by President Roosevelt, but the rail
road men.

MUKDEN'S FALL
IS KEENLY FELT
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
olas, which were flung: about ths
streets in newspaper extras and passed
from mouth to mouth. Two thoughts
formed instantly in the minds of every
one, and two words were on every lip
â surrender â peace â the former dread
ed, the latter hoped for.
General Kuropatkin is no maker of
phrases; his words never are quoted
like the famous "All is lost save hon
or," but his laconic messages probably
hide more than any other two sen
tences in the literature of war. St.
Petersburg knows nothing of the ex
tent of the disaster, not even the
lines of Kuropatkin's retreat; whether
the route to Tie Pass is still open,
whether he is endeavoring to cut his
way through to safety or whether, as
many of the pessimists believe, he has
taken to the mountains. If it is the
latter he will inevitably be hemmed
in and starved into surrender as Mar
shal Bazaine was at Metz.
The dispatch has been studied as
closely as was ever the most abstruse
text of scripture over which dog
maticians have wrestled and from the
words "All our armies" the optimistic
draw the deduction that the bulk of the
Russian forces got away clear, the
commander-in-chief sacrificing, how
ever, the devoted rear guard, who flung
themselves as prey to the Japanese
wolves who were closing in on their
trail, and sacrificed also, it is con
ceded on either hand, the greater part
of his heavy artillery, especially the
siege guns and enormous quantities of
supplies and munitions.
FATE OF THE ARMY.
Of the present situation of the
army â whether it is utterly routed or
merely beaten, of the proportion of
Russians left in Japanese hands, or
of the prospect of the escape of the
remainderâ St. Petersburg at this
moment knows less than the smallest
hamlet in America, Since the Mukden
dispatch was filed at 6 o'clock Friday
morning no dispatch save the brief of
ficial announcement of the retreat has
come from the Russian army. General
Kuropatkin's preceding dispatch klv
ing the last details as to the positions
of the army having been written at 9
o'clock Thursday evening. The mem
bers of the general staff, when asked
for information, said:
-"We know nothing. We hope he will
bring the army off safely, but we do
not know how he will do it. We only
know he has commenced to retreat:
that is all."
Every one now is discussing peace,
which many of the stanchest advocates
of the war, bureaucrats and officers,
declare to be inevitable. It openly is
bruited that Rojestvensky's fleet has
been recalled and is now on the way
homeward. The admiralty. when
asked If the report were true, said:
"We don't know. Call again to-mor
row," and declined to comment on the
significance of the cancellation of the
purchase of colliers or the direction
of Rojeetvensky's voyage from Mada
gascar waters. It can be stated, how
over, that no overtures for peace yet
have been made, and none are likely
to be made for a few days, before the
extent of the disaster has developed.
Aside from peace, defeat may bring
other consequences in its train. That
an enormous impetus has been given
to the reform movement is plain even
to the most reactionary conservative:
but the immediate result chiefly dread
ed is the effect on internal disorders,
not only in the capital, but also, since
St. Petersburg is not Russia, upon the
millions of peasants in the vast agri
cultural regions, among whom the
spirit of revolt now is incubatiner and
already has hatched pillage and arson
in a few districts. It Is believed, how
ever, that the Government is able to
nip the uprising in the bud and pre
vent radicals In the cities from brlnr
ing off anything more than demonstra
tions and talk of revolution, aside from
the peaceful revolution which has been
under way in the last six months.
DEFEAT OUTS DEEPLY.
Outwardly St. Petersburg takes the
defeat unconcernedly. A stranger in
the streets would never know that
armies defending the honor and pres
tige of Russia had just sustained a
crushing reverse. There were no
crowds last night, no demonstration;
no change in the ordinary street life.
Newsboys were hawking extras on the
streets â mere dodgers with three lines
of General Kuropatkin's dispatch, sur
rounded by wide margins of blank pa
perâbut there was nothing to Indicate
that the extras were more important
than those in which, for a year, Gen
eral Kuropatkin's dispatches have been
issued. The Government made no at
tempt to palliate the shock or explain
the significance of the retreat, but sim
ply sent the dispatch, when it was is
sued by the general staff late in the
evening, direct to the papers, with au
thorization to print. At the clubs and
in private houses, however, the situa
tion was discussed and redlscussed,
conjecture added to the fact and the
Invariable query was, "what further?"
One circle of Liberals, on receiving
the news called for wine and solemnly
pledged "New Russia." But generally
the defeat cuts deeply and is keenly
felt, especially by families represented
in the endangered army. The spirit of
unpatriotic exultation will do the Lib
erals no good at this time. As the de
feat, which one Russian correspondent
describes as "slaughter, not battle,"
entails the sacrifice of so many thou
sands of Russian lives, the people fear
to count up their losses. It is realized
that in the fighting before Mukden was
evacuated the death roll of the battle
of Shakhe must have been far exceed
ed, and the streets of St. Petersburg,
where every third woman wears crepe,
will present a somber sight when the
casualty lists arrive.

Few Believe Peace Will Follow
the Victory of Oyama Over
Russian Forces.
LONDON, March 11.â The announce
ment of the fall of Mukden was dis
counted in London by reports chroni
cling the progress of the great battle,
but the actual occupation of the capital
of Manchuria by the Japanese is the
subject of comment everywhere, es
pecially in diplomatic circles. The For
eign Office declined to comment on the
event, but there, as elsewhere, there
was intense interest in the Japanese
encircling movement and its possible
effect upon the future progress of the
war. Few who are well Informed are
inclined to the belief that Oyama's
magnificent victory and successful
strategy will bring peace within meas
urable distance, the opinion being that,
while the Russian fighting force is dis
abled and probably will be obliged to
retire farther than Tie Pass or even
Harbin, the fighting spirit of the Rus
sian nation would be increased rather
than reduced by defeat, and that only
compulsion will bring the nation to its
knees.
Baron Suyematsu, formerly Japa
nese Minister of the Interior, in the
course of an interview, said that whe
ther the victory indicated an early
termination of -he war was a ques
tion that Russia alone could answer.
The Japanese legation has been in
undated with congratulations and
everywhere the prime note was praise
of the genius of Oyama, which was
conceded even by the most pro-Rus
sian observers. The Spectator, In a
striking article, says:
"Russia, hitherto an unknown quan
tity to all but a few diplomats, is now
revealing herself to all mankind, and
the revelation of a great country in Its
hour of agony has as much a bewilder
ing effect as a great catastrophe, all
qualities, good and bad. being exhib
ited under the intolerable light of her
vast resources and astounding capa
city for endurance, her toiling people,
the inferiority of her governing class,
even the underlying ground fact of the
inadequacy of her food supply, all giv
ing hints almost amounting to prophe
cies of the future career of the great
Slav race."
Discussing the possibilities of peace,
and Russia being cowed by the great
defeat, the Spectator thinks that de
spite historic precedents, it does not
follow that the Emperor will make
peace. This difficulty of predicting
what line Emperor Nicholas will take
is admitted on all sides, but there Is
still in some quarters an opinion that
peace will ensue. According to the

INHABITANTS OF AFRICAN

MORASA, British East Africa.
March 10. â It is reported that 9000
Somalis have attacked the town of
Merkel, on the Bexdir coast, and have
annihilated the inhabitants.
Daily Graphic, overtures have already
practically commenced, the Emperor's
readiness to negotiate having been In
timated to the French Government and
communications having passed be
tween the British and French govern
ments with a view of Great Britain
opening communications with Japan.
It is impossible at present to confirm
or verify the statement of the Daily
Graphic, which declares that the de
cision is due not only to the defeat of
Kuropatkin, but also to the almost in
surmountable difficulties Russia met in
the last attempt to negotiate a loan in
Paris.
There is intense anxiety here to learn
the fate of Kuropatkin's forces and
whether the chain Oyama has drawn
around them will be strong enough to
hold them. The Russian forces must
be in a terrible plight, and a repetition
of all the horrors of Napoleon's retreat
from Moscow is regarded as among the
possibilities.
No further news of any kind has
reached London. According to one re
port, Kuropatkin's last dispatch was
sent from Tie Pass and stated that he
will almost immediately transfer his
quarters to Harbin.
The Daily Telegraph's Tokio corre
spondent asserts that the Russians are
completely ignorant of the movements
of the Japanese, and the appearance
of the latter in the Sinmlntin district
was a complete surprise. Kuropatkin's
disaster, the correspondent adds, was
largely due to an inefficient lntellL
gence department.

ROJESTVENSKY'S FLEET.
LONDON. March 10.â The Russian
naval attache here has heard nothing
confirmatory of the report from Paris
of the return of the squadron com
manded by Vice Admiral Rojestven
sky and discredits it. He expresses
the opinion that Rojestvensky's objec
tive is to effect a juncture with the
Russian third Pacific squadron, which
iÂ« too weak to cross the Indian Ocean
alone.
A dispatch from Durban, Natal, to
day says the captain of a collier which
has arrived there from Nossible Isl
and, off the coast of Madagascar,
where the Russian warships arrtved
February 3, reports that the war ves
sels are so covered with sea weed that
he does not think It possible for them
to proceed. The squadron has 70,000
tons of coal.
DISASTER EXPECTED.
PARIS. March 10. â The Japanese
occupation of Mukden Is generally
considered here as definitely showing
that the Japanese have won a victory
and that General Kuropatkin's reverse
may soon reach the magnitude of dis
aster. The French military critics say
the Japanese capture of Tieta prac
tically cuts oft Kuropatkin from re
treating northward. They also attach
much moral importance to the capture
o* Mukden, the capital of Manchuria.

STATE LEGISLATURE ENDS ITS SESSION
CLOSING SCENES
ARE MARKED BY
GOODFELLOWSHIP
Gifts Presented to Officers
in Both the Assembly
and the Senate.
Sbarboro's Name Turned Down
SACRAMENTO, March 10.â Both
houses of the Legislature finally ad
journed this afternoon. A large num
ber of the many bills introduced dur
ing the session died for lack of time to
put them through or attention on the
part of those who introduced them. Of
the hundreds' of b;ils that have gone to
the Governor^ some are bad, some good
and many of indifferent merit. The
kesf'on has accomplished some big leg
elation, though, that will make it a
historical one in the annals of Califor
nia and it has left to many holdover
committees the work of making in
vestigations of certain subjects and re
porting needed legislation to the next
session.
The usual gifts were made and im
pressive ceremonies were carried out in
both houses. Statutory employes were
voted money for post-session services
supposed to be performed by them, and
altogether the scenes of final adjourn
ment were like those witnessed at the
close of past sessions.
MILU.XKKY AND BOUQUETS.
In the Assembly no regular business
Â«at transacted save the formal ap
proval of the Engrossment ana i,nio,l
ment Committee's report and the pass
ing of a resolution appointing a hold
over committee to investigate building
and loan concerns and recommend leg
islation two years hence, the Senate
having rejected the request of the low
er house to appoint a joint committee
for that panpoae, tne rejection being
due to the turning down by the lower
house of the objectionable building and
loan bill.
lii the Senate the file had also been
cleared, but a tinal fling was taken on
the score of the building and loan fight
by refusing to confirm the appointment
of A. Sbarboro of San Francisco as a
trustee of the San Francisco State
Normal SchooL Sbarboro is secretary
of several local associations of San
Francisco.
The woman attaches of both houses
appeared generally in new millinery
and gowns, there were flowers on
many desks and the combination
brightened the scene. On desks in front
of the bars of both houses reposed sev
eral costly tokens and the throng in
the lobby waited with expectancy to
find out who were to be the lucky re
cipients.

a last tribute to the memory of this
great and good woman, he would like
to have the Senate officially represent

of the alumni of Stanford University
that was a member of the Senate. His
request was sent to President Ander

The end of the session came when
a message from Governor Pardee was

upon the good work it had performed,
the message referring in detail to sev

SULPHUR WORKS IS AGAIN
SCENE OF CONFLAGRATION
Fumos Choke Firemen and Make It
a Hard Task to Fight Fire in
Brick Building.
Fire started yesterday afternoon In
the new brick building of the San
Francisco Sulphur- Works at Bay and
Dupont streets and 8000 bags of sul
phur and the machinery in the build
ing were destroyed by flames and wa
ter.
The building is a two-story brick
structure which covers a large area.
It had been but recently built, the
former building which was situated
"n this ground having been- destroyed
by fire about a year ago.
Ten men were at work Inside at the
tfme the blaze started on the first
in a pile of siftlngs. The origin
of the blaze is unknown, but it is at
tributed to spontaneous combustion.
Before many minutes had elapsed the
;.rcad rapidly and the interior of
the building was a mass of white fire.
Immediately after the arrival of the
Fire Department a second alarm was
turned in. The fire tug Governor
Markham responded, as did the de
partment, and two streams of water
were brought to bear by the tug. The
fire proved a difficult task for the de
partment to handle. The fumes of
ulphur choked the firemen and
red thfir work. After hard ef
forts the flames were subdued.
L,ast night one of the trains of the
belt railroad was backed up, near the
scene of the fire. It ran over several
of the hoses anfl the spectators were
deluged by the shower of water that
resulted.

The police believe that Frank Kelly,
alias Hermann Isaac, whom they have
in custody, is the man who is re
sponsible for the numerous daylight
burglaries that have occurred in the
vicinity of the Sunset district for sev
eral months.
Kelly, who is an ex-convict, was ar
rested by Policemen Gorman and
Smith on suspicion. His name was
placed on the detinue book until evi
dence could be obtained agrainst him.

BOODLERS
MAKE THEIR
LAST STAND
File a Writ of Mandamus in
Supreme Court Demanding
That They Be Reinstated
as Members of the Senate
ASSERT THEY HAVE
BEEN MISTREATED
French, Bunkers, Emmons
and Wright, in Final Hour,
Rise in an Effort to Stay
Fate That Threatens Them
SACRAMENTO, March 10.â In the
Supreme Court this morning: a writ of
mandamus was filed by the attorneys
for ex-Senators French, Eli Wright, E.
J. Emmons and Harry Bunkers, de
manding the reinstatement of the ex
pelled members in the upper house of
the Legislature. The hearing on the
petition for mandamus has been set for
April 3.
The motion for reinstatement was
ma*ie on the ground that the expulsion
of the Senators was null and void and
beyond the power of the Senate and in
violation of the constitution of the
State and the constitution and laws of
the United States.
The petition recites that the Senate
did not give the deposed Senators a
hearing or an opportunity to be heard
in their own defense upon the charges,
and did not afford them a trial upon
any of the charges, nor permit them to
make any defense thereto. The action
of the Senate in expelling the Senators
is declared to be entirely arbitrary.
The petition says that the proceed
ing's of the Senate were entirely ex
parte and without due process of law;
that the charges are false in every par
ticular and were prompted by the Sen
ate and sustained wholly and exclusive
ly from political motives, and without
regard to their truth or falsity.
It is urged that the four Senators
have no plain, speedy or adequate rem
edy in the ordinary course of law, and
that mandamus proceedings are their
only alternative.
The documents are supplemented by
the customary affidavits signed by the
four Senators, alleging that the state
ments made in the application are true
upon their information and belief.
The Senate before adjourning named
the Attorney General to act in the mat
ter.
CARMEN SEEK
THEIR OLD JOBS
Withdrawal of Support of
National Leaders Has an
Effect on Gotham Strikers
NEW YORK, March 10.â Although
the local leaders are continuing the
fight despite the fact that the national
leaders have repudiated their action in
calling the men out, the strike on the
subway and elevated railway systems
has passed the acute stage and trains
were running to-day with little delay,
the strike breakers quickly learning
their new duties, while many of the old
men were back in the positions which
they left on Tuesday morning. There
was no general rush back of the old
employes, but the men slowly weak
ened and there was a steady stream
passing the company's offices all day.
The officials were discriminating, and
while many of the guards and ticket
sellers were taken back, few positions
were found |for the motormen, it being
feared that* some damage might be
dona to the company's property. This
action, It was feared, 1 ould give the
police something to do, as the men who
were refused work were in an ugly
mood. Some three hundred men in all
were reinstated.
The company stated that not more
than one-half of one per cent of the
strikers would be reinstated; in fact,
late last evening there were only 40C
vacancies to be filled, another 200 strike
breakers haviiffe arrived during the
afternoon from Scranton and Wilkes
barre.
It was said at the company's offices
that Messrs. Jencks and Pepper had
sought an interview with Superintend
ent Hedley, but had not succeeded in
getting one. Jencks when seen said
he had not received a telegram from
Stone In Cleveland. Of the situation
he said:
"The locomotive engineers went Into
the strike knowing that the national
body would not support them. It is an
independent strike and Is being carried
on in an Independent way. It makes
no difference what the national body
thinks or what action they take. We
are carrying on the strike, which is
entirely on local matters, and we will
fight to a finish."
According to a statement issued by
the company the utmost quiet pre
vailed up to a late hour and the con
ditions fast were becoming normal.
No men ware placed at work during
the night, but arrangements have been
perfected for having the men in read
iness to the number of nearly 1800 to
report for work to-morrow.
Discouragement, discontent and up
braiding of their leaders character
ized the sllmly attended meetings of
the strikers.
There was much crowding at the
stations to-day during the rush hours,
resulting from the slow headway of
the trains and delays caused by sev
eral minor accidents, but the presence
of the police prevented any serious out
break.
Miss ChesebrouKh Captures Cup.
Miss Edith Chesebrough won, 7 up,
from Mm. R. Oilman Brown on the
Presidio golt links yesterday in
the play-off of the second tie-that re
sulted between them in the ladies'
handicap competition against "bogey"
over eighteen holes, match play, on
Tuesday afternoon. This victory gives
Miss Chesebrougrh the artistic two
handled silver cup awarded by the di
rectors of the San Francisco Golf and
Country Club for this event. *

PARDEE TELLS
OF WORK.
Reviews the Session Fainting
Out Good It Has Done.
He Congratulates the Legislators
SACRAMENTO, March 10.â Oovernor
Pardee sent his final message to the
Senate and Assembly to-day just be
fore the hour of adjournment. The
message is as follows:
The end of the thirty-sixth session of the
California Legislature la at hand, and I gladly
take advantage of the opportunity to congrat
ulate you upon the completion of your labors
and upon the solid and valuable results at
tained. In the sixty-eight days which the ses
sion has occupifd you have dealt -with a vast
number of legislative matters, many of them
of Immense Importance to the people, and it Is
my belief that no other. Legislature has mani
fested greater industry or a more sincere de
sire to serve the State.
More than f*-o thousand bills have been In
troduced in the two houses, besides a largo
number of resolutions and constitutional
amendments, and, necessarily, time has been
lacking to giva jnany of these the mature
consideration which they deserved; but the
amount of business transacted is highly cred
itable, and I believe that very much of the
legislation accomplished will be beneficial to
the State.
In a number of instances policies have been
Initiated which are distinctly new departures,
and which, I am sure, will constitute a
marked advance ln the right direction.
' Not least important among the measures
of the session has been the legislation for the
organization of a great drainage district la
the Sacramento Valley, which Is expected to
lead to the control of the winter floods and
the reclamation of over a million acres of fer
tile land.
Other measures also tending; toward Indus
trial development on a large scale are hut lit*
tie less important, such as tne arrangement te
continue Irrigation and other investigations
through co-operative efforts by the State and
Federal governments: the creation of a Board
of Forestry; the cession of the Kiamath Lake
lands, preparatory to the development of 4
large irrigation system ln the northern part
of the State; the making; of appropriations to
carry on horticultural, viticultural and agri
cultural experiments and researches, and the
purchase of a farm for the Collage of Agricul
ture. The part which the latter will play ln
the application of science to our leading In
dustry, and the solution of difficult problems
of practical farming and animal husbandry,
is destined to be a great one.
TAX AND PRISON REFORMS.
A beginning has been made in the reforma
BUSY MEN JOIN
THE MINISTERS
Hear Remarks by the Rev.
A. C. Bane and Sing Hymns
at the Noon-Day Sendee
"There is In every man the desire
to be happy," began the Rev. A. C.
Bane in his remarks to the business
men who congregated in a large body
at the noonday service at the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday. Mr.
Bane continued:
It U a natural desire to be happy and to bo
successful In life. If we listen to God he will
teacn us how that desire may be gratified.
So many fall to be happy; so many fail to
reach success; bo many mere are whose lives
are blasted; so many whoae hopes are unreal
ized. Than why the failure to be happy â the
failure to be successful In the busines world?
Gentlemen, the Bible contains the rules for
success. Christianity Is the Ideal, and because
we fall to live in harmony with God's rules
can be fou-i<l the cause of failure. There Is
order in the physical and moral universe. As
we reverse God's order, so life is written down
a failure. To be successful everything* must be
subordinated to the making; of a righteous
character. If we honor God ha will see to it
that our lives are successful ; that -we shall
have success in the material things of thla life.
The time has come when we reverse the
great procession that Is moving through the
world. We have the world lead and Ood fol
low behind. Let Ood go to the front in our
plan*; >et Ood go to the front In our lives.
We cannot reverse without failure.
His chief purpose is to build character and
make us a sharer in his grory. These tempo
ral successes are not everything in life. Man
can never be satisfied with mere things. Men
who live mere things live unhappy lives. Man's
heart and not his ledger tells how happy he Is.
If gentlemen we are to gret the most out of
life we must live by spiritual, eternal Ideals.
The words of Jesus Christ can be applied to
the commercial world to-day. Were the Golden
Rule followed then there would be more suc
cess In life, more happiness In Ufa, and the
world would be bound together in brother
hood.
God gives us our abilities, our health, opens
the floors for trade, enriches our cause. We
should not forget God, but should make htm
the partner in our business. When a man dies
it were better that Instead of Baying he left
so many dollars say that he left a Christian
character.
Samuel D. Mayer presided at the
organ and several hymns were heart
ily sung.
For the convenience of strangers
it is particularly desired that it should
be known that the service takes place
every noontime, except Sunday, during
Lent in the assembly-rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce on the second
floor of the Merchants' Exchange,
California street, near Montgomery.
The Rev. E. E. Baker, D. DMD M wlj|
speak to-day and the Rev. John
Hemphill, D. D., on Monday.
tlon of our revenue laws by the creation of a
tax commission and thÂ» passage of the direct
Inheritance tax and life insurance tax and
corporation license tax lawi. These will ralsa
a considerable amount of additional re^r^nue
during thÂ» next two years, and It Is to o
hoped that at Us next session the Legislature
will be prepared to take a longer st*p In the
direction of an entire separation of State and
local revenues.
You have taken another new departure la
State financa by submitting to the people a
constitutional amendment to authorize the de- ,
posit ln banks under careful safeguards of
State, county and municipal funds, and also
the enactment of a statute which may become
operative as to deposit of State moneyi even
without the adoption of the amendment re
ferred to. I believe It Is sound public policy ]
to get away from the old plan of locking up
largo amounts of the circulating medium dur
ing the first monthe following the collection
of taxes, and also to secure to the State and
counties a revenue from their unused funds, i
Again, this Legislature has passed acts
amending the banking. Insurance and building
and loan laws ln a manner to put these
branches of business on an Improved basis.
For the first time a Legislature bae fairly
grappled with the problem of prison reform.
Many acts have been passed which are In
tended to improve the condition of Â©ur penal
Institutions, and appropriations amounting to
more than half a million dollars have been
made for construction purposes at Saa Quen
tin and Folsom. When the moneys Â«o gen- '
erously provided have been expended Call- :
fornia should have two modern-style prisons
lacking nothing ln equipment to put them on a
plane with the best penitentiaries ln the
country.
Another direction ln whloh the Legislature
has been justifiably liberal la ln the appro
priation of money to modernise our beautiful
State Capitol building, which, nearly fifty
years after Its erection, still stand* a credit
to ttÂ« builders but which la much In need
or interior renovation.
SCHOOL AND CODE BILLS.
Of the many law* you have resell ln the
Interest of publio education two of the moat
noteworthy are the statute providing; for a
more Just method of distribution among the
counties of the moneys raised by taxation, for
the support of the public schools, and toe
appropriation of 9150,000 for the erection of a
building for the San Francisco Normal School.
Another example of good legislation to ad
vance the welfare of the rising generation Is
the child labor bill, which la directed to the
prevention of some of the worst of toe social
evils of Dor age.
The State health laws have been revised and
provision made for more careful and accurate
work ln collecting and compiling vital sta
tistics.
Finally I may mention as one of thÂ« greatest
achievements of the session the. pasaage of
some two hundred code revision bills The
Civil and Penal codes have thereby been re
vised and brought up to date which ts in
itself a very desirable thing, but which be
comes more remarkable when contrasted with
the failure of previous attempts to enact thta
form of legislation.
In conclusion I again congratulate the mem-
bers of the legislature upon the fruition of
their labors and wish them pleasant journeys
to their several homes.

Subject of Resolution
A resolution was adopted yesterday
by the San Francisco Real Estate
Board to Instruct its executive com
mittee to confer with other bodies In
this city, to the end that Commissioner
Grunsky at San Francisco may be in
dorsed and that President Roosevelt
may be requested to retain him as a
member of the Panama Canal Com
rr.lesion. ThÂ« Chamber of Commerce
trustees will hold a special meeting
next Monday to consider the same sub
ject, and other commercial organiza
tions have been requested to act.
The work of the Society for the Im
provement and Adornment -of San
Francisco was also indorsed. Samuel
O. Buckbee. A. E. Buckingham and J.
T. Harms spoke in favor of Indorsing
Commissioner Grunsky, taking the
ground that It Is for the good of San
Francisco to have representation in the
; Panama Canal Commission. The in
â¢ dorsement of the Adornment Associa
tion resulted from a communication
from Secretary McCaleb. J. H. Speck
epoke strongly in advocacy of Indors
ing the work.
'In his communication McCaleb in
. vited the members of the board to visit
Architect Burnham at the bungalow^
1 on Twin Peak, where surnham is pre- i
paring the plan* for the improvement
and beautlfication of the city. Among
the matters under consideration- are
parks and park extensions, a boule
vard approach to Golden Gate Park,
new roads in and out of the city that
will make the hills and suburbs easier
of access, designs for an opera-house.
Â« fire-proof auditorium, museum and
an observatory.
President Howell presided and re
marked that the matter of " city im
provement, brought before the board
by reason of the communication from
MrCaleb. furnished one reason for
railing the board together. This was
the first gathering of the board since
its organization. Several meetings of
the executive committee have been
held and effective work has been per
formed. President Howell reported the
status of the legislative measures that
have enlisted the attention of the

Memorial Church.
RÂ»v. John Stephens, formerly pastor
o' the Simpeon Memorial Methodist
Episcopal Church, came last night
among his former parishioners and
delivered a learned and interesting
i*<*ture. his theme being "Flights of
Fancy." Mr. Stephens received a cor
dial welcome from a large audienoe
and in return gave a literary treat
which will long be remembered. He
illustrated the stern, cold reality of
things and at times gave poetic touch
and plctureaqueness to his subject.
The church choir sangs some beau
tiful selections, including Rossini's
"Ptabat Mater." The quartet sang
"Vale of Rest" and a number from
"The Creation" was splendidly sung

it is very difficult to adequately ex-

of inward trouble with the kidneys, I
had not the slightest doubt about the
cause of the complication, but what
to do to stop it was a mystery.

FRIEDMAN'S PROPERTY
All Action Looking Toward
the Annulment of Sale to
Merchant Will Be Dropped
The Methodist Book Concern prop
erty controversy may be said to have
been brought to a close with the au
pearance in San Francisco of Dr.
Henry C. Jennings and Edwin R. Gra
ham, the publishing agÂ«ntÂ« of the West
ern Methodist Book Concern, who ar
rived from Cincinnati on Thursday
night.
The two gentlemen were accompa
nied by Judge Boyd, also of Cincin
nati, who came specially to take part
la the conference with the commission
having charge of the local book con
cern. The matter of the sale of the
property, 1037 Market street, to Louis
Friedman for $125,000, was discussed at
length by the agents and those in au
thority here.
Speaking of thÂ« result of the confer
ence to a Call representative last nieht
C. B. Perkins, a member of the local
commission, said:
When It was brought out at the oonference
that the store formerly occupied by the Book
<"onrern had be*n rented for a saloon and bil
liard hall Dr. Jennings and Mr. Graham ad
vised thai no further action be taken looking
toward the annulment of the sale to Fried
man.
I>r. Jennings and Mr. Graham gave the local
commission every assurance that new and
more eligible property property better adapted
to the needs of the Book Concern, would bÂ«
immediately secured and a modern building
erected.
In the meantime a lease has been taken of
the etore In the Burnett block, situated at
142*> Market street, to which the depository
and the editorial rooms cf the California
Christian Advocate will remove In a very
few dayÂ». lUe 1125. 000 paid by Friedman
will be invested by the MethÂ»dlst Book Con
cern in San Francisco.
The Methodist community generally
express confidence that Dr. Jennings
and Graham will give to their srrowine
territory unusual co-operation.
Both the doctor and Graham will ad
dress the Methodist Ministers' Union
and laymen at Epworth Hall next Mon
day morning, outlining their policy in
relation to the contemplated new struc
ture.
GAS ORDINANCE
IS NOT VALID
The Los Angeles gas ordinance, over
which there has been so much litiga
tion, has been declared invalid by the
United States Supreme Court 'in two
test cases. The State Supreme Court
was reversed in both instances. News
of the action of the nation's highest
tribunal vu received by the Just'ces
several days ago and the Clerk's office
was officially notified yesterday. Ono
case wae a petition for a writ of ha
beas corpus and the other was a dam
age suit.
The LoÂ» Angeles Board of Supervis
ors decided to keep a projected gas
factory outside of certain limits and
passed a general law to fit the case.
A penalty clause was attached to the
measure. Martin Daly, an employe of
the gas company, violated a feature of
the ordinance before witnesses and was
arrested. Caroline W. Dobbins Insti
tuted a civil suit for damages to test
the same provision and both crises
were taken to the Supreme Court to
gether.
Daly was convicted of violating the '
measure in Question and was fined ;
$100. He appealed to the Superior
Court, which upheld the action of the \
inferior tribunal. The State Supreme ;
Court sustained the lower courts and '
an appeal waa finally taken to the '
United States Supreme Court. Caro- I
line Dobbins claimed that she had been
damaged through the enforcement of
the ordinance because it interfered
with her constitutional rights.
The Federal Supreme Court holds
that the measure in aiming to pre- i
vent the construction of a gas works '
within certain limits !s vlolatlve of the '
constitutional provisions, which guar- I
antee rights in conducting legitimate I
business to all citizens. Daly Is or- j
dered released, Caroline Dobbins gets
$144 damage* and the gas works will j
be constructed as planned.
mtervisors to oppose
bills before governor
Will Protest Against Two Measures
Affecting Acquisition of Munici
pal Water Supply.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
received word from Governor Pardee
that he would grant a hearing to rep
resentative* of the city of San Fran
cisco In opposition to two bills now
In his hands for signing. One of the
bills considered objectionable by the
Board of Supervisors is Pendleton's
Senate bill relative to condemnation
proceeding* under the rl*ht of emi
nent domain which provides that any
county through which runs a pipe line
or flume for the conveyance of water
shall have the right to condemn the
same.
The effect of the measure will be to
cut off San PVanclsco from a munici
pal water supply from the Sierras, as
under Itp terms any Intermediate
county could condemn the water run
ning through Its Jurisdiction for its
own uses.
Duryea's Assembly bill No. 398 fix
inp the cash value of water works as
a basis upon which water rates shall
be established instead of the actual
coÂ«t of construction will also be op
posed by the Supervisors' committee,
which will be accompanied by Assist
ant City Attorney Partridge when San
Francisco's aide of the questions Is
presented to the Governor.
Better Service on Cable Lines.
It was announced yesterday by Man
ager Chapman of the United Railroads
that with the increasing of the speed
of the Market -stret cable next Monday
mcrning a better service will be given
tru- traveling public. The change will
affect mainly the Castro and Hayes
street lines, upon which the headway
of the cars will be considerably short
ened, without decreasing or otherwise
interfering with the service on the
other lines in the big cable system.

WOULD REBUILD
FIRE HOUSES
Carpenter Doyle Reports
Many Structures to Be in
an Unsanitary Condition
BIG EXPENSE INVOLVED
Commissioners Think Well
of the Plan, and Matter
*Will Soon Be Considered
At the weekly session of the Board
of Fire Commissioners yesterday after
noon a report was received from Chief
Carpenter Doyle setting for the bad
condition of numerous engine-houses
throughout the city. In several in
stances Doyle recommended that the
structures be entirely rebuilt, for many
: of them are in such a dilapidated con
dition that repairs would prove almost
useless.
Doyle recommended that engine
house No. 5. 1219 Stockton street, be
replaced with a brick building, the
estimated cost to be about $18,000,
Engrn*-hous* No. 9, 820 Main street,
should also be replaced, in Doyle's
opinion, at a cost of about $20,000.
Truckhouse No. 24, 449 Douglass
â  street, is also unfit for use and a new
building there is recommended by
Doyle, to cost about $18,000. Truck
house No. 9 has also been condemned
by the chief carpenter, who recom
mends that a wooden structure to cost
$12,000 or a brick building to cost
$IS,OOO be erected.
The chief carpenter also went into
details regarding repairs in other en
gine and truck houses throughout the
city. He finds that many of these
places are in an unsanitary condition
and that the health of the firemen is
endangered while they remain there.
The estimated cost of repairs to these
buildings will be $39,468. The Cora
m'ssioners approved of Doyle's report
and the matter will be referred to the
Board of Supervisors and the Board of
Public Works for their approval.
Chief Engineer Sullivan reported
that the department had been exper
iencing untold trouble with the hose
recently supplied by two large con
cerns in this city under contract. When
the material was put to a test it waa
found to be unsatisfactory in every
way. The rubber was not up to the
standard and the couplings in most in
stances refused to work.
The Chief announced that the hose
had been returned as unfit for use and
that the delay was keenly felt in the
department. There are only 45,000
feet of reserve hose on hand, while the
department requires 10,000 feet. The
Commissioners approved of Sullivan's
report and hereafter the firms will be
forced to live up to their contracts to
the letter.
James H. Timon, 126 Twenty-ninth
! street, was appointed an engineer in
: the department from the civil service
list. He was instructed to report for
duty to Chief Sullivan.v.
James Dooley, truckman of Truck 8,
and Thomas Collins, hoseman of En
gine 3, were up before the board on
charges of failing to report for duty.
Both men had been drinking. Their
cases were taken under advisement by
the Commissioners. They will prob
ably be reprimanded or fined and re
stored to duty. Four crippled firemen
appeared before the Commissioners to
explain the causes of their injuries.
The Commissioners will consider their
cfises. All were hurt while going to
fires within the last four months.
BUILDING PLANS
OPEN TO PUBLIC
The Joint committee on Public Util
ities and Finance of the Board of Su
! pervisors yesterday agreed upon the
\ framing of an ordinance providing for
the construction of the proposed school
I buildings, library, hospital and addi
tion to the Hall of Justice, the plans
thereof to be open to public competi
tion.
A committee from the San Francisco
Chapter, Amerloan Institute of Archi
tects, addressed the committee in sup
port of Its petition that competitive
plans for the new buildin t ,.; \>a printed.
Henry Schultz, president of the chap
ter, said the Federal Government had
adopted the competitive plan with
good results. Librarian Clark explained
the manner of securing competitive
plans for library buildings In New
York, Louisville and other cities.
President Roncovieri of the Board
of Education favored the competitive
plan, but wanted the Washington
Grammar and other school buildings
exempted, as plans for same had al
ready been prepared at a great cost to
the city under the special levy of 1902.
Altmann suggested that a premium
of $1000 be awarded foi- any accepted
plan. This was opposed by W. 'H.
Mooser, who contended that several
prizes should be offered so as to in
duce good architects to enter the con
test. The committee was of the opin
ion that no plans should be exempt
from competition, but postponed for
mal action until next Friday, when the
Chapter of Architects will present sug
gestions to enable the formulating of
a proper ordinance on the subject.
The committee recommended the ac
ceptance of the offers of Frank Fischer
and F. S. Neves to sell lots to the city
for the proposed Golden Gate Park
and Presidio Extension under the bond

SPRING TRADE
IS IMPROVING
NEW YORK, March 10.â R. G. Dun
& Co.'s weekly review of trade will
cay to-morrow:
Confidence has become general
through resumption of work, improv
ing of spring trade and expectation
that the war will smm terminate.
Weather conditions are favorable in
most sections of the country, and there
is little Interruption because of labor
controversies. Some inconvenience was
caused by the local strike and retail
trade suffered temporarily, but in the
aggregate the commercial loss was not
extensive. The most gratifying news
of the week emanates from the iron
and steel industry. Commodities are
in demand. Exports gained $2,071,013.
Trafflo conditions are getting better,
few complaints of delay being heard
and railway earnings for February
were only 4.2 per cent smaller than in
ISO 4. Hides continue flrm considering
the season.
Failures this week numbered 244 In
the United States, against 259 last year,
and 26 in Canada, against 25 a year
ago.
NEW YORK, March 10.â Bradstreef s
to-morrow will say:
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending March 9 number
190, against 206 last week, 200 In the
like week in ISO 4, 176 in 1903, 244 in 1&02
and 207 in 1901.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 40, as against 22 last week and 27
in this week a year ago.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending March 9 are 1,286.95fi
bushels, against 907,937 last week;
1,834,632 this week last year, 3,366,796 in
I'JO3 and 2,096,250 in 1902.
From July to date the exports are
44,698,362 bushels, against 110,824,315
last year; 11Â«,043,930 in 1903 and 182,643,
201 in 1902.
DAUGHTERS OPPOSE THE
CLAIMB OF AGED FATHER
Children of Andreas Zlhn Prerent His
Recovery of Property Deeded
to Them.
Three daurhters of Andrea* Zihn,
â who is 70 years old and feeble, are
opposed to him In a will contest that
is being tried In Judge Seawell's court
The old gentleman is said to have as
signed his property to his children,
with the understanding that they pro
vide for him in his declining years.
Zihn determined to marry again
and after arriving at this conclusion
he attempted to make a will provid
ing for wife number two, forgetting
his agreement with and assignment to
his daughters.
The daughters explain their pos
session of the property by saying they
accepted it from their father as a
Christmas gift. Zihn claimed that the
deeds presented to the daughters in
common were to have been given
them at his death, but they worried
him so much that he finally signed
them.
ONLY MERIT
WILL COUNT
WASHINGTON, Marcn 10.â A gen
eral policy as to Federal appointments
was determined upon by the President
and his Cabinet to-day at their semi
weekly meeting. At the conclusion of
the meeting it was announced that, for
the present at least, the uniform policy
would be to retain incumbents in office
as long as their services were satisfac
tory. The policy announced Is to ap
ply generally to all departments of the
Government ,
In line with the general policy of
civil appointments. Secretary Taft said
it also had been determined not to ap
point as brigadier generals on the
active list of the army officers who had
served forty years, including service in
the Civil War. Those officers are now
eligible to retirement as brigadier gen
erals and it Is not the purpose of the
administration to make them briga
dier generals on the active list. The
Secretary said there were approxi
mately forty such officers, all of whom
would be permitted to retire as briga
dier generals or to continue In the
service in their present grade at their
option. The adoption of this policy
will open the way for the appointment
as brigadier generals of many younger
officers than have heretofore had that
grade.
TO ESTABLISH NEW BANK.â South San
Francisco will have a Barings and commercial
bank. The Institution will be established by
P. N. LllUnthal, Daniel Meyer and Eastern
men. The capital stock will be 150,000.

FORCED TO SHUT
DOWN PLANT
INDEPENDENCES. Kans.. March 10.
The taking of testimony in the pro
ceedings brought in Sedan, Kans.,
against the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad and others for al
leged violation of tHe anti-trust law
began here to-day. John Aber of
Moran said the Moran Gas and Crude
Oil Company had built up a fuel oil
trade in Kansas City, but when the
advance in rates came last fall it was
compelled to shut down its plant and
let its tank cars remain idla. He said
the company owned two tank cars, and
when they were in service the Missouri
Pacific Railroad paid mileage on them,
but he could not say how much.
W. J. Young of Pittsburg. Pa., pres
ident of the Prairie Oil and Gai Com
pany, said he owned" all except four
shares of the stock of the company, the
other shares being held by the direct
ors. There has been issued by the com
pany two and a half millions of de
benture bonds, and these are held by
the National Transit Company of
Pennsylvania. He said he owned 100
shares in the Standard OH Company of
New Jersey. He did not know there
had been an advance in freight rates
on crude petroleum last fall.
Young was examined by F. 8. Mon
ne-tt. He brought no bonds or papers
with him.
Soms are good, some better and some best.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
FIND BODY
HIDDEN IN
THE MIRE
Peter McCoigan, a Saloon
Man Who Received $1000
Recently, Is Found Dead
and Money Is Missing
POLICE THINK THAT
MAX WAS MIJEDEBED
Detectives Find No Trace
if His Movements Since
He Had the Coin and His
Partner Has Disappeared
-r.d Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, March 10.
Under circumstances that have called
for police investigation, the body of
Peter McColgan, formerly one of the
proprietors of the Venezia Gardens, a
resort at 572 Seventh street, was found
1> ing face downward this afternoon in
the mud at the eastern end of Tenth
street, near Fallon. W. D. Steele,
a passerby, saw > the corpse and
notified the Coroner, who removed the
partly decomposed remains to the
More Papers on the body disclosed
the identity. 1
\\ hat has s^t the detectives at work
â  fa- t that five weeks agr> Me
an received a large amount of
y. not less than $1000, for his mi
i in the saloon in which he and
< hswfea sfcore of IT Turk street. San
Francisco, had been partners. When
the body was searched only $2 50 in
coin v.as recovered. The police could
fl:.d ro trace of McColgan's where
abouts since he went out ofÂ»business
and they cannot explain whether his
death was the result or accident or
fi'Ul play. Thtro were no external
marks of violence on the corpse. It
was suspected that possibly McCoigan
had wandered into the marsh while
under the influence of liquor, or was
inveigled into the lonesome district and
murdered for his money. At any rate
tbe coin has not be*n accounted for,
nor have McColgar's movements since
he strld out been followed with any
definiteness. He and Moore had been
in business together at the Gardens for
come time. When they decided to give
up business they found a prospective
purchaser in the person of Charles
Fischer, with whom negotiations were
concluded five weeks ago. Fischer said
to-day that he had paid $2(KK.i to Moore
and McCoigan, each of whom took his
own share out of the proceeds of the
sale.
Fischer declared he knew nothing
about McColgan's habits nor where he
had gone after surrendering possession
of the resort. Up to that time he had
been residing there. The body's ap
pearance indicated that McCoigan had
been dead about ten days. Deputy
uer Quellen. who searched the
clothing, found some keys, the coin
and among other papers a promissory
note for $600 made in favor of McCol
gatt by Edward S. Clark of Arden
Station, which is a small railroad point
on the narrow gauge line, two miles
west of Newark. The note was dated
last year, some time before McCoigan
disposed of his business in this city.
Another mysterious feature of the
case is that Charles Moore has also
disappeared. He has not been heard
cc McCoigan drifted out of sight.
People at 17 Turk street say that both
partners disappeared at about the
same time.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. MARCH 11, 1905.
BOND CAMPAIGN
IS AT AN END
Bombardment of the, Voters
of Oakland on the Water
Proposition Is Concluded
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 10.
After a campaign of education, dur
ing which Oakland has been flooded
with an enormous amount of printed
matter, the citizens will vote to-mor
row on a proposition to issue bonds for
the construction of a municipal water
system. For weeks proponents of the
project, as well as opponents of the
plan, have been at work, deluging the
city with their arguments. Hundreds
of thousands of pamphlets covering ev
ery phase of the issue have been cir
culated. The mails have been swamp
ed with matter. Every householder in
Oakland has been cared for by both
Bides. Besides, a personal canvass has
been made in an effort to reach the
voters who have it in their power to
decide the question at the polls.
The project is that of the Bay Cities
Water Company, which purposes to in
stall a water system which shall de
liver not less than 20,000,000 gallons
dally at the southern boundary of the
city. Bonds in the amount of 53,750,000
must be voted if the city decides to ac
cept this proposition. In addition,
bonds for $1,9F>0,000 are also required as
the estimated cost of a pipe line dis
tributing the system inside the city.
The total of $5,700,000 is the amount
upon which the vote will be taken to
morrow.
It will require a two-thirds affirma
tive vote to carry the bonds.
Polling places, fifty-seven in number,
have been established throughout the
city, and the City Clerk has sent a
notilication to each voter showing
where his polling place is located. The
polls will open at 6 o'clock a. m. and
will close at 5 o'clock p. m.

ORATQKS' FINE WORDS
Candidate for Mayor Mott
Makes Stirring Talk at
Enthusiastic Gathering
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 10.
A big Republican love feast was
held to-night at the Dewey Theater in
celebration of the close of the munici
pal campaign.. Unusual enthusiasm
marked the meeting, which was at
tended by a large audience. Speeches
were made by Frank K. Mott, the
nominee for Mayor, and other leaders
in the city and State. A rousing re
ception was given to A. P. Leach, the
Republican nominee for City Attorney.
On the platform were F. C. Turner,
Charles D. Bates Jr., George J. Fitz
gerald, G. E. Aitken. Arthur H. Breed
and other candidates.
Frank W. Bilger, chairman of the
Republican City Central Committee, in
troduced H. C. Camvell, who was pres
ident of the evening. He read a letter
from Governor George C. Pardee, who
said he could not leave Sacramento at
this time. The Governor added: "A
ticket with Frank K. Mott at its head
ought to compel the confidence and
support of a constituency like that of
my home town."
District Attorney John J. Allen made
a rousing appeal to Republicans to
stand by the ticket from top to bot
tom. A. P. Leach spoke for harmony
In the municipal administration.
Samuel M. Shortridge, who had been
Invited by the committee to talk to
Oakland's Republicans, eulogized Oak
land and said: "I am here as a Re
publican. I am a Republican In mu
nicipal, In State and in national af
fairs. When I have been called to talk
to Republicans I go no matter wher*
the call may come.
STRENGTH OF PARTY.
"A party is something more than an
organization of men. Through it must
run an enduring idea. There must be
a love of country, of State, of city,
actuating it. Make your party strong
by voting with it at all times."
Frank K. Mott was warmly wel
comed. During his address he said:
It is highly proper that the people should
have an opportunity to hear and see the men
who aspire to public office, but you will fully
agree with me when I say that it is not only
Improper, but positively foolifh for a candidate
for office, especially the office of Mayor, to ut
ter long strings of promises all beginning with
the big capital letter "I." The Mayor of
Oakland Is but one party to a partnership â
you are the other party, and only by agreeing
as to terms and Items can we accomplish any
thing. I have said that this is no time for
egotism, but It Is a time for a straight per
fonal talk, and that I propose to give you.
But one promise has been made by me during
this campaign â that If elected I shall give to
Oakland the best that I have. The more one
sees o' political life the more one Is Impressed
with the futility of promises. A man may go
upon the rostrum and tell his fellow citizens
that he will do thus and so, never considering
the conditions that might arise to forbid him
absolutely from following such a course as he
had promised. He may have been sincerity
Itself In the making of those promises, but he
finds when confronted with the situation that
hp. has been compelled to stultify himself.
As a candldate*for Mayor of Oakland. It 1b
due to you and to myself thsrt I should' make
a definite 'statement concerning my attitude
toward municipal affairs. This. I believe, can
be done wKhout my going too elaborately Into
thÂ« conditions that make the administration of
Oakland's government somewhat difficult. And
I believe that such a statpment as I purpose
to make will not compel me to go on record
with a lot of ante-election pledges which
might perforce have to be swept aside like
chaff In the face of specific conditions.
SUBJECT OF TAXES.
â¢ The most important .subject â  to the . voters
and the property owners :of . Oakland Is the
tax rate. The charter of the "city of Oakland
fixes a limit of $1 for the maintenance of the
city government â this dollar limit means that
no money, can. be raised for general operations
outside that figure.- That the levy has been j
higher than that Is due to the demand for pay- !
ment of bond interest and â¢ redemption and â  for 1
the support of our high schools | and â â . pubfio I
parks. These additional : amounts are author- j
ised by special acts of. the Legislature. It
goes without uaylng that Oakland is advanc
ing rapidly In population. This means . that
there ip a steadily Increasing demand for more
fire I protection, for more â  policemen, for more i
sanitary protection, in short, for a greater ex- I
penditure of public funds in the administration
of civic affairs. .It will be a problem deserv
ing of â  much thought â¢ and study to i make | the
Income | fit the j constantly growing I demands
upon it.' I am one of those who believes that
our municipal government is honestly, conduct- |
cd. V I', have sat In ; thÂ« City Council ' and . have
had opportunity to see where the money goes.
I have seen, the closest scrutiny given to bills
against ; the. . city, and have done what was In
my power to Insure ! economy and thrift In the
handling of public ; money. - As Mayor lof Oak
land I should : Insist upon that- degree of care
! In the' expenditure â â : of municipal coin .as 111
exercised by any conservative business man In
the conduct of hi* private Interests. â¢ The tax
rate must kept within the dollar limit, for
our city charter so requires. So there can be
no argument with: that charter provision, star-
Ing us .in . the face, and ito i attempt â to Â£ make
politics , out of ;. this > condition Is \ but = dema
poguery. It Is due ' to the people of Oakland
that they should know where I stand on this
question of 'taxation. .:- Let smÂ«;5 mÂ« ; remind -.them
that I am ', personally - concerned ias â  a ; citizen
of i Oakland - In this ' subject. . v My r Interests and
yours are : Identical.*;. â -. Fconomy "in ; municlnal
affairs means ' lust as much to me ; as It 'â  does
to you -and this should be a' sufficient guaran
tee of jmy position ; on the subject of taxation.
â¢ PUBLIC ; IMPROVEMENTS.
Next in importance on the list, to my mind.
Is thÂ« matter of public improvements.
Throughout thiÃ campaign I have said that
Oakland was a show city; that Its magnificent
natural advantages made It essentially a city '
that should always be on exhibition. I be
lieve In fine streets and sidewalks. I want
to see the city clean and beautiful from the
bay shore to Fruitval* and from thÂ« estuary
to th? Contra Costa hills. It Is as necessary
to make a city attractive from an esthetic
point of view as it is to develop all of its
natural advantages on the commercial side.
These functions of government run hand In
hand, and must be given equal consideration
In mapping out the campaign of finance by
which the sinews of war are attained. Of
course, we must have firemen, policemen,
health and street officials. "We must have our ;
park* beautified, our thoroughfares k?pt fresh
and in aood retmlr. public property of all de
scriptions kept up. and such improvements
mad? as the state of the public treasury will
permit. It shall be one of the prime pur
poses of my administration. In event of my
election, to share the ' expenditures of our
public funds that some permanent betterments
shall accrue.
in looking about the city we find that it
comp&res on all sides very favorably with
other municipalities of California, not only
In its general condition, but In such matters
as street Improvement and the like. Thl^
does not mean that we have perfect highways,
or that there is no need for battering condi
tions. But it does mean that there are many
cities of this State which are much more back
ward than Oaklr.nd In public matters. For
years It has been the custom in Oakland to I
belittle Â»r.<3 to attempt deterioration of every
thing that the city tries to accomplish. As a
matter of fact, Oakland gone ahead at a
pne# that It is hard to realize. I have seen
this development and am glad to see that our
people are seeing It. ana appreciating its
value. The commercial organisations are do-
Ing good work In that direction. We must
all ret behind them and help to build and to
make permanent the foundation upon which
Oakland's sreat future Is to rest.
IN A BETTER CITY.
You must realize that this is the day of the
electric motor. You must understand that the
sta?'- coach day has gone. We must get to
gether and make Oakland not only a great
but a beautiful city, attractive to business
WEAVING WEB
ABOUT KINIRY
Prosecution Makes Strong
Points Against Man Who
Is on Trial for Murder
HAS MUCH TO EXPLAIN
Admissions 3fade by Defend
ant to the Police Place
His Head Within Noose
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 10.
Two damaging points were brought
out against David Klniry to-day in his
trial for his life for the murder of Po
liceman J. H. Smith on the evening of
November 27, 1903. Both of them tend
to show that it was he and not Joseph
Goldstein who fired the murderous
shot.
The first was in the dying statement
of Smith, that was taken down in
shorthand by Eugene Van Court, in
which he said: "On* of the two men
suddenly stepped back and fired two
shots at me; I then pulled my pistol
and shot the other man. He had the
beardless face of a youth and was as
tall as I. I did not get the one who
shot me." *
Another point was the finding of a
loaded weapon near where Goldstein's
body was lying. Chief of Police Hodg
kins and former Policeman Lee An
drews testified to finding the pistol ly
ing on the grass, about twenty feet
from the dead robber.
From the admissions already made
by Kinlry to the police that he and
Goldstein were bent on robbery when
overtaken by Smith, he has virtually
admitted that he was guilty of mur
der. The courts have held in like cases
that the murderer and accessory are
equally guilty.
Kiniry's fight, however, is to evade
hanging and Attorney Frick is trying
to show that while his client may be
guilty of robbery, or by Implication
of murder, he did not actually do the
shooting.

SAVANT TELLS
OF LIFE ORIGIN
Important Volume Produced
by Dr. Loeb Received
at the University Library
SCOPE THE WORK
Professors and Students In
terested in Summary of
Kesuits That He Achieved
Berkeley Office San francisco Call,
2149 Center Street. March 10.
The result of Professor Jacques
Loeb's researches Into the problem of
the origin of life are contained in two
volumes, advance copies of which
came to the library of the University
of California to-day. They have been
eagerly awaited by students and sa
vants alike, their publication being re
garded by scientists a.s an Important
event In the history of biological rt
bearch. The work is entitled "3tudlÂ«a
in General Physiology." It came from
the University of Chicago press.
The scope and character of the work
are indicated by the preface contribut
ed by Dr. I-oeb, in which several sig
nificant and deeply interesting state
ments regarding the origin of life are
made. The preface is, In part, as fol
lows :
I should not have had the courage to offer
these volumes to the public had I not repeat
edly been asked . by physicians and biologists
to render my publications, which are widely
scattered, more easily accessible. Therefore,
when the editor of the Decennial Publication*
of the University , of Chicago invited . me to
make a contribution to the series... 1 mentioned
to him. not without hesitation, - the .tdoa of
collecting and republishlng my papers on gen
eral physiology. ... spite of - the di
versity of topics, a single leading Idea per
meates all th* papers of this collection, namely,
that it Is possible 'to get the life-phenomena
under our control, and that such a control and
nothing else Is the aim of biology.
Thus the reader will notice that In a series
of these publications I have tried to find the
agencies which determine unequivocally the
direction of the motion of animals, and he will
also notice tnat I consider a complete knowl
edge and control of these agencies thÂ» biolog
ical solution of the metaphysicial problem of
animal instinct and will.
In the problem of regeneration I started out
with the idea of controlling then* phÂ«w>mÂ«na.
and considered It our nrst aim to find means
by which one organ could, at desire, be caused
to grow In the place of another crgan. Thus
the experiments on heteronjerphosl? originate*!.
As ' far as . the problem of , fertilization is
concerned,*, It seemed to me that the j first step
toward its solution should consist in the at
tempt Ito produce larvae artificially from the
unfertilized t>gg3 In various classes of animals.
Dr. Loeb's book is made up of thirty
eight chaptf-rs. Some of the most Im
portant of these deal with the follow
ing subjects:
.."Instinct and Will in Animals": "A Simple
Method of Producing From One- Egg Two or
More Embryos Which Are Grown Together" :
"Contributions to the Brain "Physiology of
Worms";. "The Influences of Light on the De
velopment of Organs in Animals"; "The Phys
iological Effect* of Electrical Waves": "ThÂ«
Physiological Problems of To-Day"^ ? â  "On th*
Artificial Production-. of' Normal Larvae From
tha Unfertilized Eggs of 'the Sea Urchin."
WOULD SETTLE
FOR CUT HOSE
Efforts Invoked on Behalf
of Southern Pacific Men to
Make Amends for Damage
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
10) fc Broadway, March 10.
The cases of Victor Gazzole, engineer,
and Harry Reed, fireman, of the Ala
meda local train that cut two sections
cf fire hose la#t night at the Pacific
Lumber Company fire, First and Clay
streets, were continued to-day in the
Police Court pending further action by
Chief Engineer Ball of the fire depart
ment. Chief Ball said to-day he had
caused the arrests because this was
the third time engines had cut his
hose while It was in service at fires.
At last night's fire by the cutting
of the hose thÂ° department was holp
less in the face of llamea that threat
ened a large amount of property. Ball
declared the engineer had ample warn
ing and that Gazzt-le had admitted he
saw the crowd when his engine was ac
Brush street, where he slowed down,
four blocks west of where the hose
crossed the^track.
Two sections of hose, each fifty feet
long, were destroyed. Persons who did
not disclose their identity made over
tures to Chief Ball to-day to stop pros
ecution provided the damage done was
covered by payment to the city for th 3
ruined hose. Chief Ball said he would
agree to that course, as he had no de
sire to do more than to protect the de
partment In such cases. He contended
ihat if th--* hose had been cut five min
utes soonc-r a great mass of shingles
and a large barn warehouse would
have been attacked by the fire. The
supply of water from the two lines was
bhut off from the fire at a critical time.
The firemen were compelled to un
couple the severed sections and remove
them before they could renew their
streams.
It was asserted by the trainmen that
their view of the hose was obstructed
by the crowd. Ball asserts signals were
displayed to stop the train.

I 'onions Wins the Race.
Th* Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer Pomona, which has been running oe
tween here and Eureka for some years, ar
rived yesterday from the Humboldt pert after
ore â  the most exciting runs of her career.
The steamer moke was put on the San
Kranciseo-Eureka run recently in opposition
to the. Pomona. The Pomona, on the trip end
ea yesterday. left the Humboldt port in eocn
pany with her new rival. thÂ« Roanoke. There
was no understanding at the start that the
run bo:oe was to be a race. When the Roanoke
began tÂ» crÂ«ep ahead, however. Captain Swan
eon of the Pomona, without giving any or
ders, let the chief engineer know that there
Â«ould be no objections to the. Pomona's en
gines rrvoivtng â  little faster. Without giving
any orders the chief engineer let it be known
In the Creroom that hotter fires make eteam
jron* quickly and that a few pounds more
oi Ebeem might cheer up the engines a lit
tle. Then the Pomona began to draw away
from the Roanoke. Toe Ruanoko's engines
were "cheered up" and the Pomona's lead
â¢was reduced. Before long the race was on in
*-hrr -st and although Captain Swanson later
made bland denial of all knowledge of any
>â ;â¢"â  (\ contest, there was a gleam of joy in his
e\e when, upon the Hoan'>kÂ«" - arrival, he
figured out the Pomona a winner by forty
minutes.
Laucbes Tackle Big Tow.
Two gasoline launches yesterday towed the
b:g Government dredger Chinook from the Ris
don Iron Works to â â  anchorage well out in
Mission Bay. The Chinook was formerly th*
army transport Grant and is one of the largest
â¢\ossels on the coast. The launch Meteor and
one rtf the Risdon Iron Works gasoline boats.
were the towbeats. It was slack â water and
there was no wind or the Chinook might have
dragged the launches. Instead of that, how
ever, the launches, tugging tandem, made a
good job of an undertaking that the biggest
and smartest â  boat en thÂ» bay would not
have considered beneath her dignity.

Judge Hunt yenterday awarded
Walter Morgan a Judgment of
$2007 65. together with $772 interest
and costs for money due from the
Board of Education. Morgan, in the
capacity of architect, did work for the
Board of Education In 1899 which
was accepted, but when he presented
his bill It was refused payment on the

The appointment by Governor Pardee
of Henry J. Crocker to the Board .of
State Harbor Commissioners surprised
the politicians and evoked many com
ments of approval in mercantile and
marine circles. It is reported that no
effort was made by the friends of
Colonel John C. Kirkpatrick to secure
the latter's retention in office for an
other <erm of four years. There were
several applicants for the position, but
neither the incoming nor the outgoing
Commissioner was among the number
seeking recognition. Four years ago,
when Colonel Kirkpatrick was appoint
ed, It was surmised that his duties aa
manager of the hotels, ranches and
other vast properties of the Sharon es
tate would take bo much of his time
that he could not give personal atten
tion to harbor affairs, but the surmises
were not well founded, as the Commis
sioner gave the State the benefit of his
excellent business judgment on all
building operations under the direction
of the commission.
In business and political circles the
selection of Mr. Crocker as a Commis
sioner for a term of four years affords
special gratification. He is known
throughout the State aa a progressive
man, of sound business judgment. He
is not in any sense airy or self-impor
tant, but Is the kind of a man that all
men can meet. Mr. Crocker is a Re
publican. As the leader of the city Re
publicans in the contest for Mayor in
li'oÃ he made an energetic and worthy
campaign.
It is expected that Governor Pardee
will make many appointments within
the next twenty days. From this time
until next Saturday his attention will
be chiefly engrossed on legislative
measures awaiting his Judgment, hence
the names of the Judges of the new
Courts of Appeal may not be an
nounced until the end of this month.
It is the general talk in political circles
that the five Supreme' Court Commis
sioners will be appointed to the Appel
late Courts.
One of the events in the career of the
Union League Club of California will
take place this evening. The reception
and grill rooms get apart and superbly
equipped for the use of ladles will be
opened. The function to-night is to be
purely a club affair. Members of the
league and ladies of their respective
families are expected, but the invita
tions do not embrace others. The en
tire main floor of the clubhouse will be
used to accommodate the throng this
evening.

THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, SAN FRANCISCO
BAI MARCH 11, 1905
OUR PHILIPPINE TRADE.
*T*HE statistical pamphlet issued by the Pacific Commercial Mu
seum in this city should stir our merchants to an active effort
to tarn the trade of the islands from Europe to this coast. Com
taercn I matter of sentiment. It is exceedingly practical. Its
exchanges go to those who seek them, not to those who depend on
national sentiment, international relations, or political considera
tions.
Commerce follows commercial enterprise and energy. It is a
mistake to suppose that because our flag is in the Philippines it will
matkally locate our trade there. The two have but little re- j
tattoo. What seems to be needed is that our merchants make a |
commercial survey of the islands, to disclose the needs of the people, f
who must look to an external supply. When that is done the |
capacity of San Francisco to meet that demand may be easily known. !
and in meeting it the tastes of the market to be supplied must be j
known and conformed to, strictly. The latter point is one in which \
American commerce frequently fails. Customers abroad will not j
take what we think they ought to want, and made or packed in the I
shape in which we think the best for them. They want their taste j
satisfied, not ours. Other countries that have long catered to the
Asiatic trade understand this principle thoroughly, and in that un
derstanding is the secret of their control of the trade.
The sarong, the long cotton garment worn in Asia from the i
Gtilf of Oman to the Irawaddy, is made in the mills of Lancashire. !
The British manufacturers could undoubtedly make a different fash
ioned garment, better adapted to the purpose, but their Indian cus
tomers would not buy it nor wear it. In the West Indies the natives
like best what we call "sour pork," which they eat with molasses. !
We call it spoiled meat, but if we sent them prime bacon they would
refuse it.
In Europe, and especially in the British isles, the market de- j
mands bacon cut in a certain way, and has also a special taste in
hams and shoulders, and the rise of our meat trade there came only
when a Scotchman started cutting and packing in this country to
suit the taste of that market. If the Filipinos want cotton goods
striped like a barber's pole and colored like an Easter egg. we should
give them the stripes and colors they want, for they will not btty
according to our taste, and will consult only their own. If we made
idols or images for the heathen, as Great Britain does, the figures
must not represent our ideas of art, but must respond to those of
the people who believe in the efficacy of the idol, cast according to
their notion of what makes the image supernaturally powerful.
It will be seen that in dealing with the people of the islands and
of Asia we cannot expect to work off on them the surplus that is
left after supplying our domestic demand. They will refuse it. We
must in all of our fabric trade manufacture especially for that mar
ket, and to get that trade we must compete with the other com
mercial nations which do the same thing. The commerce of the
Philippines is considerable and is capable of enlargement. The pro
ducts of the islands are valuable. Their production of sugar, to
bacco, hemp, rubber and gutta percha is large,' and by some fostering
can be increased.
The product of rubber and gutta percha is especially important.
The latter gum is the only substance that will protect submarine ca
bles. Not an ocean telegraph cable can be laid without its use, and
its cost is the principal expense in such construction. At present
England has a monopoly of gutta percha. The whole Philippine
yield goes to Singapore and is handled by British merchants. Of
course the trade produced bv^he exchange is in their hands also.
The British monopoly is largely sustained by the supply from, the
Philippines. American commercial enterprise and ingenuity ought
to find some way to turn the trade in this most important article from
Singapore to San Francisco. If this were done, it would break up
British monopoly in gutta percha.
The rubber trade is next in importance, and it is believed that the |
islands can be made large producers of that important material, and
that they offer unusual facilities for the putting out of rubber planta
tions that will contribute to the future supply of an article that yearly
increases in price and importance. Manila tobacco is capable of great
improvement in quality and quantity by proper attention to its cul
tivation. There is no reason why it should not equal the Sumatra
wrapper, which is a necessity in fine cigar making. The Manila hemp
is produced nowhere else, and its value in rope and cordage is con- ,
tinually increasing. The value of these leading products is by n<\.
means the total of the commercial capacity of the islands. There are |
other existing native products that enter into trade, and the agents j
of our Agricultural Department may discover many uses to which the
soil of that country may be put, that will supply many other valuable
articles of exchange.
There are about 10.000,000 people there, tropical people it is
true, but still a people whose wants are not completely supplied by
their own soil and climate. Other nations exert themselves to get
the trade. We cannot expect it to come to us without exertion. We
are of the opinion that it will pay the merchants of San Francisco
and the producers of California to send one or more commercial ex
perts to Manila, to visit all of the islands and make a complete com

WEATHER STATION AT SAN JOSE.
THE location of a meteorological startron at San Jose is of great
practical importance to the Santa Clara Valley, in which a very
important part of our fruit industry is planted. The producers
of California have been immensely benefited by the Federal weather
service. Indeed there is hardly any part of the Federal service that
exceeds this in importance. It eminently safeguards production on
one hand by its warnings of the coming of frost, flood and rain, and
irmerce on the other by its storm signals along the coast.
The prune crop of the Santa Clara Valley dominates the prune
market of the United States and controls prices in Europe. When
the French prune crop fails, Santa Clara prunes are exported to
Kordeaux. and after being processed in the French method of pack
ing are marketed as French prunes in order not to lose the market
for Bordeaux fruit. The Santa Clara crop is exposed in the drying
season, and if the dryers are not warned of untimely rain great
losses may result. The local station will perform this and other im
portant functions.
There is room in the State for other extensions of the weather
service. There is no station between Fresno and Los Angeles.
Rakersfield commands a very important agricultural and horticul
tural region, so far from Fresno and Los Angeles as to have a me
rology of its own. Last Sunday heavy rain fell east of Bakers
field and there was a precipitation of nearly half an inch in that
town. It did not rain at Fresno and therefore the precipitation did
not appear in the reports at all. The home-seekers who axe now re
sorting in large numbers to California soon learn to look up the
records of rainfall. In the Sacramento Valley they find such records
at Sacramento and Red Bluff. In the San Joaquin Valley they exist at
Fresno only. Rakersfield should be a station, and then statistics will
available from the midst of the valley and from its southern ex
tremity.
well known the meteorology of Los Angeles is entirely
without relation to that of the San Joaquin Valley, so thdt record is
without varW this side of the Tehachapi.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY. MARCH 1.1, 1905.
THE CALL AS AN ADVERTISING MEDIUM.
ONLY a novice in advertising will declare that advertising is a simple proposition. There is prob
ably no department of business which requires a clearer insight into local or general conditions
and a finer perception of the methods of feeling the public pulse than the department of pub
licity. One may be thoroughly capable of preparing attractive copy and yet allow, prejudice or habit or
the specious argument of the advertising solicitor to guide him in the selection of a wrong medium. It
is true that badly prepared copy in a good medium will fail of results, but it is a fact even more pro
nounced that good advertising matter in a medium circulating in an element to which the copy does
not appeal cannot win. ]n the main it may be said that the question of greatest import to the purchaser
of advertising space is. "What medium shall be employed?" If it is to be a daily newspaper (and the
daily newspaper is conceded to be the most valuable organ of publicity) the question to be determined
is, "Does it circulate in the locality or among the class of people who will to the largest extent seek
these particular goods?" Where the merchant has to offer the general or specific articles of home con
sumption, there need beno hesitancy in selecting the paper known to have the HOME circulation â a
distribution in the homes of the buying and largely cash-paying classes.
In the morning field The Call does not claim to have the largest distribution, but does claim,
without fear of contro version, that it has the largest circulation where circulation does the most good
to the advertiser â that is, in the ciass of homes where there is money to meet the necessary require
ments, and tastes and tendencies which call for the expenditure of considerable sums.
So far as known, The Call is the only San Francisco newspaper for which advertisers have
been willing to make and have made affidavits that in the conduct of their advertising campaigns their
announcements in its columns have brought larger returns than advertisements placed jn any other San
Francisco paper.
For fhe month of February, 1905, the total distribution of The Call reached 1 ,846, 1 59 copies ;
of this great total 1,493.465 copies were of the Daily and 252,594 copies of the Sunday editions. The
average daily distribution was 65,231 and the Sunday distribution 88,148 copies. It seems hardly neces
sary to invite attention to the excellence of the news service, local ami foreign, of The Call. It is
frequently ahead of its competitors in giving the world news of important events, and so carefully is
the matter edited that the reversal of its published articles is a rarity. The conditions therefore existing:
I. Of a news service of indisputable superiority.
If. A large circulation. .
111. An unquestioned distribution in the homes of the buying element of the community, to which
the merchant must necessarily appeal if he hopes to meet with success in business :
constitute the strongest argument for the use of The Call's advertising columns as a medium for
publicity.
The Call's circulation books are always open to advertisers and advertising contracts are
entered into on the basis of its monthly sworn statements of circulation.
IN HALL OF FAME
AND FUN
SPEAKER CANNON, A BiG GOtf
Likewise known to fame as
"Uncle Joe." â New York
Herald.
SHE KNEW HE WAS
GOING TO BE
SHOT.
Spiritualists were exchanging experi
ences last night at the Tuxedo, sayÃ
the New York Sun. Several well
known mediums were there, a preach
er, two or three Christian Scientists
and a few business men. Some of the
stories told were first-class ghost tales.
Miss Margaret Gaule of 257 West One
Hundred and Thirteenth street, who
has given a number of "tests" at the
Tuxedo, told this story, which she in
sisted was true in every particular:
"When I was 15 years old I went to
work in a shoe store in Baltimore as a
clerk. One day a man, whom I knew
by sight as a rich business man and
prominent socially, came into the store
to exchange a pair of shoes his wife
had purchased the day before and
found unsatisfactory. As I was re
storing the shoes to the wallcase I
heard, as sharply and distinctly as if
it had been fired close to ray ear, a
pistol shot. I asked the man if he wan
in the habit of carrying a revolver.
'No,' said he, very much astonished.
Something Impelled me to touch again
the shoes his wife had worn. Again
I heard a shot. It came over me at
once, I couldn't explain how, that the
man was going to be shot. I told him
I didn't want to alarm him, but that I
believed he was going to be hurt, may
be shot. Naturally he laughed at me
and left the store, telling me I was a
FRIENDSHIP!
"Borem and I are good
friend*."
"Do you like hiÂ« jokes?"
"No; but I like his ci^am."
SBARBORO AND THE STATE SENATE
To the Editor of The Call:
I have just learned that the Senate
has refused to confirm my appoint
ment as "State Normal Trustee,"
which had voluntarily been made by
the Governor without any solicitation.
The reason, I understand, given by
the Senate was that I antagonized the
building and loan association bill
which the Senate had unanimously
passed and which the Assembly upon
due -investigation has voted down.
I stated that the Senators did not
thoroughly understand the true in
wardness of the bill which they ap
proved â that if they had they certain
ly would not have passed It. I believe
so still, as that bill would have been
detrimental to the 120 honest "local"
building and loan associations of the
State which have been the means of
procuring homes for thousands of
wage earners and the saving of $50,
000,000 by young wage earners of Cal
ifornia, which in a large measure
would have been squandered.
I Incjose you a copy of a letter
which I sent to Assemblyman Drew
and which gives my reasons in full
for antftgonixing the Senate bill. You
will observe that at the end I say:
"I have helped to organize and
have annually been re-elected secre
[ tary of five of these meritorious insti
! tutions for the past thirty years, and
during that long period of time, al
though I have handled several millions
of dollars belonging to thousands of
stockholders, not one of them has ever
i left the office of the associations with
which I am connected without receiv
i ing every dollar he has paid in,
! whether he withdrew in three days,
three months or three years after he
made his payments, together with a
reasonable Interest on his temporary
or permanent investment."

MISS ANSTRUTHER touched the
purple blossoms at her breast
with caressing fingers.
"They are lovely," she said;
"so fresh and fragrant. I think
them the only flower for a man to send
a woman."
Carrollton laughed. The dinner had
reached the stage where general con
versation glides Imperceptibly into
monologues or duets. The soft shaded
lights, the odor of flowers, tempted
to confidences.
"Then you agree with a friend of
mine who declares it is deceitful for
a girl to buy violets for herself, thus
creating a false impression of owning
a 'young man,' " he answered lightly.
Miss Anstruther's lips curved into a
slow smile.
"I am trot sure that I should go so
far as that."
"Well, perhaps not. And yet" â Car
rollton's voice grew more serious â
"I suppose the Bending of violets does
mean more than the gift of other 1
flowers. When a man begins to asso
ciate a girl with violets it's usually all
up with him."
Miss Anstruther, a faint hint of dis
quietude creeping into her dark eyes,
glanced quickly around.
"Butâ but couldn't he have sent
them for any other reason â because he
knew she liked them â for congratula

IMMENSE PROFITS
OF STANDARD
OIL.
In the twenty-three years of itt
existence the Standard Oil Company
has paid $496,065,000 in dividends on
it* $100,000,000 of stock. This $49Â«,
065,000 is considerably more than one
fifth of all the moneyâ gold, silver and
paperâ in the United States, says the
New York Press.
The $496,065,600 hitherto distributed
does not represent the total profits of
the oil combine. What its surplus and
undivided profits are no one outside
of the Innermost hierachy of the oil
kings knows. Nor is there any means
of knowing how much is spent eac
year in lobbying and in influencing
legislation, in crushing competition
and strengthening the grip of the
combine on its monopoly.
By far the larger part of the Stand
ard Oil profits has been accumulated
in the last nine and a quarter years.
Prior to 1896 the total dividends paid
amounted to less than $130,000,000.
Since that date the profits have been
on such a scale that the total is
astounding.

viction.
"Andâ and if she wear* thÂ«m?"
anxiously.
"I think the man would be Justified
in construing it as a hopeful sign,
don't you?"
Miss AnÃtruther flushed painfully
and dropped her eyes.
"Why, I â I â " she stammered.
"Duck, air," interposed the butler
at Carrollton's shoulder. When he
again turned toward Miss Anstruther
she was talking gayly with her left
hand neighbor. Carrollton, free to let
his eye wander, fell to watching the
eager, beautiful face of a girl across
the table â a face that sparkled and
changed with every varying thought.
"And if she doesn't wear them," he
'â  mused a bit ruefully. .
Miss AnÃtruther finished her dinner
with the consciousness of having, in
all probability, answered the greater
part of her companion's remarks with
utter irrelevance. She could only trust
that Mr. Morris, a fluent talker him
self, might not have noticed. The
girl's thoughts were hopelessly tan
gled. Carrollton's words about vio
lets had startled and disturbed her.
Did he really attach such significance
to the linie flower? She had never
dreamed of such a thing, and pinned
;on the odorous cluster before dinner
with enjoyment of their beauty, in
deed, but without any idea of occult
meaning to the act. But now â her
eyes sought him doubtfullyâ a little
wistfully. Did other men feel that
â  way about violets, too? She must
speak to him again, but not now.
After dinner, however, the house
party scattered. Miss Anstruther felt
herself borne along to the billiard
room, while Carrollton sat down for
; a rubber of bridge. It was not until
some time later that Carrollton, walk
ing down the hall, absorbed in wor
rying as to why Ethel Wheatley had
â so persistently avoided him all the
I evening, heard his name being called
softly. Turning, he found Miss An
struther facing him within a curtained
window embrasure, her cheeks scarlet,

I was breathing rapidly.
"Forgive me for stopping you," she
said. "Butâ but I wanted to tell you
something," avoiding his glance as
| she spoke. "It â it Isn't announced yet.
But IâlI â I am going to marry Joe
Wright. Iâ l felt that I must tell
j you," she ended half beseechingly.
: Carrollton, conscious of a vague ex
pectancy in her attitude, hesitated.
"It's awfully good for you to let
'me know," he answered. "I congratu
late you both most heartily. Joe's
a bully chap, and mighty lucky, too."
he added a little awkwardly. "Of
course, I am to be an usher." Wriat
was it the girl wanted, Carrollton
, wondered; he noticed that she had
grown quite white.
"You â you and Joe are such friends
that I was sure you knew," she strug
gled. Why was he making it so hard
for her. "It was only at dinner that
I began to suspect â when you spoke
about the meaning of violets" â her
voice was unsteady â "I â I never
dreamed that you cared; I thought
you had sent me them because "
She stopped, startled by the change
in his face. Carrollton Jumped.
"I â I sent you," he stammered, star
ing. Miss Anstruther stared in turn.
"But â but didn't you?" she demand
ed. "I found them in my rdom. Your
card was in the box. To be sure, it
was not addressed. Tell me," with
a quick inspiration, "there was some
mistake, then?"
Carrollton, taken aback, was striv
ing to regain his wits.
"I â I sent them to the blue room,"
he muttered stupidly, then bit his lip.
What a brutal speech! A sudden flash
of comprehension lighted the girl's
face.
"To the blue room," she repeated in
undisguised relief. "Why â oh!" Dart
ing Impulsively into the hall. Miss
Anstruther seized a girl standing by
the billiard-room door, and before
either she or Carrollton could realize
what was intended, had whirled her
behind the curtain.
"Ethel," she gasped, "here's Mr.
Carrollton proposing to the wrong

breathlessly. The next moment she
had vanished down the hall. Miss
Wheatley, startled and a little indig

" It>s â it's true." he murmured in
coherently. "I've been trying all the
evening to tell you, only you wouldn't

"What made Patricia think you were
making love to her then?" demanded
th? girl, still resentful. Carrollton
shook his head.
"I don't know," he groaned be
wilderedly. "Sheâ she began talking

EASY CHANGE
When Coffee Is Dof Harm.
A lady writes from the land of cotton
of the results of four years' use of the
food beverage â hot Postum Coffee:
"Ever since I can remember we had
used coffee three times a day. It had
a more or less Injurious effect upon us
all, and I myself suffered almost death
from Indigestion and nervousness
caused by It- I know It was that, be-
cause- when I would leave it off for a
few days I would feel better. But it
was hard to give it up, even though I
realized how harmful It was to me. :
"At last I found a perfectly easy way
to make the change. Four years ago
I abandoned the coffee habit and began
to drink I stum, and I also influenced
the rest of the family to do the same.
Even the children are allowed to drink
It freely as they do water. And it has
done us all great good. I no longer
suffer from indigestion, and my nerves
are in admirable tone since I began to
use Postum Coffee. We never use the
old coffee any more. â¢ We appreciate
Postum as a delightful and healthful
beverage, which not only, invigorates
but supplies the best of nourishment as
well." Name given by Postum Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich.

Tarns Up.
SAN JOSE, March 10.â Captain W.
K. Tulloch of Alameda enjoys the dis

was the last heard of tTulloch until
Wednesday morning, when his wife re
ceived a letter from him in this city,
which was written at the St. James
Hoiel, telling of his presence here. The
letter was rambling in its contents.
The writer declared that he hardly
knew what had happened since he left
home, and he expressed the belief that
he had been drugged. Mrs. Tulloch at
once hastened to this city, and failing
to rind him reported the matter to the
Sheriff's office.
This morning Under Sheriff Benson
received a telegram from Mrs. Tulloch
that her husband had returned to his
home last night. No other information
was conveyed in the dispatch.

wealthy mining man. He was form
erly in the employ of the Southern Pa

Trainer Moulton of Stanford
Finds 1 Quartet of
Clever Half - Mile Men
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
30.â While Trainer "Dad"' Moulton's
face is always beaming, this week it
has borne an unusually expansive
smile. The reason for it is the devel
opment of four good haif-milers. This
: at the beginning of the season,
threatened to be the weakest point in
the track team, and th* veteran trainer
â  many sleepless hours worryine
this race. The past week has
dispelled ail of his early fears. Russell,
a junior who has not been especially
prominent on the cinder path, yester
day made the remarkable time of two
minutes and four and one-fifth seconds.
This is a fast performance considering
the period of the season. Then Be veil.
â  freshman, who has been trying out in
the quarter mile, covered the distance
in two minutes five and three-fifths
seconds. Miller, another freshman, ran
in two minutes six seconds, and
Bounds, a member of last year's tra< k
fam, finished in two minutes seven
seconds. "I wonder where this flood
f-milers came from," was "Dad's"
ejaculation as he held the watch on
th< last sprinter.
Track prospects are bright for the
Cardinal th!s year. The few old men
are constantly improving and the
youngsters have come up with a rush.
The particular star of the freshmen is
Horton. an athletically built younester
from Ukiah, the place from which
ford draws so many stars, la the
lÂ«iw hurdles he is running close to

pure of victory at the intercollegiate
fi'-ld meet, and a place in the hammer
throw should fall to his lot. Miller is
the next freshman of prominence. He

ed. Weller made another of these
s=cmi -official records in the low hurdles
covering 220 yards in twenty-five and
eight-tenths seconds. Of the other old
men Captain Bell and Dehy have
jumped five feet and nine inches.
Crawford, who won first place in the
hammer throw last year with 135 feet
to-day threw the chained weight more
than 149 feet, beating all his previous
trials.
These performances have brought
smiles to - the face of Trainer "Dad"
Moulton and Joy to the 'hearts of the
bleacherites. With the addition of
Harry Lanapan, who is counted onto
win both hurdle races, the Stanford
track team promises to be the best in
the history of the university.
Baseball prospects, however, are not
so rosy. On account of the death of
Mrs. Stanford ball games have been
canceled, and the men have lost much

Burns Squ.irrs Himself.
Policeman W. I. Burns should have
been "in Judge Lawlor's court yester
day morning to be arraigned on the
charge of perjury alleged to have been
committed by him while testifying
for the defense at the trial of Charles
Wyman. the . ballot-box stuffer. He
failed to make his appearance and the
Judge ordered a bench warrant Issued
for his arrest and Increased his bail
to $5000 cash. Burns appeared later

COLLEGE OARSMEN
PLAY WATER POLO
Berkeley Athletes Take to
the Game and Expect
to Have a Crack Team
BERKELEY, March 10.â Water polo
is to be made a prominent sport at the
University of California, if the plans of
the enthusiasts who row play it are
j successfully carried out. C. Hiester of
â  the boating club's executive committee
I is receiving name? of those who desire
i to try for places on a varsity water
i pole team. The liet is sufficiently long
to indicate that the sport, though now
a novelty, will soon be established and
become popular. Several mÂ«>n are daily
playing: the game at the boat club's
headquarters. They propose to organ
ize two teams with the intention of get
ting a game with the Olympic Club
team or some other crack organization.
Water polo is a leading sport in some
Eastern colleges, but has never been
played with any regularity at the Uni
versity of California. The water is at
the right temperature to make the
sport enjoyable.
The interclass regatta of the univer
sity is to be held on the Oakland estu
ary on Saturday, the 18th inst. Each
class hae a strong crew and all are
being coached by Garnett, the new
rowing director of the university.
The men training for the senior crew
are: K. O. Bannister, captain of the
varsity crew; D. M. Evans. G. J. An
teff, E. V. Dodee, L. It. . Drury, C.
Hiester and J. P. Loeb. the latter for
c<>ckswa!n.
Candidates for the junior orew are-
W. A. Schmidt. W. MrFariand. E. J.
; Snow, J. W. Armstrong, W. M. Luce,
iC. G. Osgood and R. P. Xewcomb.
I fiophnm'Tf are Georpe

B. Alvarado. H. Beckwith and A.
Salisbury. There are sixteen men in
the freshmen squad and from these
the coach will choose a crew.
The tnterclass races will be held in
four-oared gigs over a one mile course.
Thf freshmen and sophomores will row
and the seniors and juniors will be op
ponents. The winners will meet in a
final race.
The interclass field day is to be held
tn-day. when Trainer OTiristi* 1 is ex
pected to get a line on the men who
will be chosen to go against Stanford
5n the intercollegiate field day on
April IS.
W. A. Powell, formerly a star athlete
of the university, is urging the forma
tion of an alumni track team, to be
made up of old Stanford and California
traok and field stars, these to engage
in contests with both Stanford and
California men this spring. The alumni
lean would include such men as:
Stanford â Dole, champion pole vaulter;
Hyde, holding the coast record for the
phot put, and Holman. captain of
Stanford last year. For California
there would be: Powell, a great hurd
ler: Cooiey. a crack jumper; Woolsey.
a sprinter: Bewinp. an all around
athlete: Hannigan. a hurdler and i
sprinter Wilcox, pole vaulter; Tibbets, j
mile runner; Plaw, hammer thrower ]
and shot putter: Clifford, half mile
rutimr.
Practice games of baseball have not
thus far resulted in many victories for
California, but Coach Williams is con
fident the team will not fail of defeat
ing Stanford on the big day in April.
He is not discouraged at the team's
failure to score now. being content to
have the nine develop gradually and
become proficient in team work through
a series of practice games.
Burglar Caught in Act.
Jerry Mulcahey was arrested late
Thursday night by Policeman Mc-
Donnell while trying to force open
the rear door of R. Landsman's sa
loon at California and Steiner streets
When searched 102 bread tickets and
ten telephone checks were found in
his pockets, which he had taken from
the till in a bakery at 2439 California
street. He was taken to the City
Prison and booked on a charge of at

On the Presidio athletic ground in t^iis
city the Occidental eleven will play a
match against the Vampires for the
benefit of Alexander Mathieson, a well
known Occidental player, who was so
unfortunate as to crush his foot in an
elevator accident. The ball will be
kicked off at 2 p. m. The teams will
line up in the following order:

The Sacramento football players are
becoming so enthusiastic about the
association game that they have made
arrangements to receive visits; from
each of the city teams. The Independ
ents, winners of the league champion
ship, will visit the capital city on Sun
day, the 19th inst., and the Eagles of
Alameda on Sunday, the 26th inst.
The match played last Sunday on
the ground s at Ninth and Bryant
streets in this city between the Pick
wicks and the Oakland Hornets result
ed !n a draw, each team scoring one
goal. In a league match, where the
score ie reckoned by points, each team
would take one point, but in cup
matches one team must defeat the
other, the winning eleven passing on
to the next round and the losing team
dropping out of the contest. The
match between the Hornets and Pick
wicks will, therefore, have to be re
played, and this will be done at Free
man's Park, Golden Gate, on Sunday
the 19th inst.
Wants Her Son Arrested.
Mrs. Maggie Adler, 8806 Twenty

Police Judge Mogan yesterday for the
arrest of her son William on a charge
of petty larceny. She said that he
had stolen an overcoat, a suit of
clothes, a watch chain, revolver and
$5. He wanted to join the circus, and
she said he would be found there.
RARE SPECIMENS
WILL BE FEATURE
Forthcoming Exhibition in
Mechanics' Pavilion to Be
of Educational Value
The study of birds and bird life is
not a fad; it is of the greatest scien
tific importance to the progress of the
State, as has been frequently proven.
To the busy man of affairs the enthu-

iastic observance of bird habits ap
pears trivial and beneath notice, yet
it is of the greatest importance to
agriculture. Only a few weeks ago
there was a protest from a portion of
the Santa Clara Valley over existing
game laws, which prevent the killing
of quail except during certain seasons.
They pleaded for destruction of the
little game birds, making the point
that grape and grain crops were in
danger of being ruined. The Game
Commission sent a man to the field,
several of the supposed pests were
killed and the crops were found to
contain only insects, seeds of per
nicious weeds and a few grape pits.
Further study showed the grape seeds
were from fruit that had fallen from
the vines. The plea was proved to be
for the destruction of the agricul
turist's best friends instead of his ene
mies.
In the forthcoming exhibition of the
Forest, Fish and Game Association
at the Mechanics' Pavilion in April,
it ip hoped to bring the general pub
lic on a more intimate footing with
the feathered tribes that make Cali
fornia a home. The educational pro
cess will not be of the dull sort. The
vast avaries are to contain as nearly
as possible every manner of bird in
the State. Short, terse lectures will
be eiven at intervals in such language
that a child may understand.
To obtain these varied specimens
the association has had two men in
the field for some time. They are
thoroughly equipped with leg irons,
ropes and other apparatus necessary
to the work, and are trying more
particularly to acquire large speci
mens* of water and shore birds, such
as herons, ' seagulls and the like.
There are several colonies of rare
birds within a hundred miles of San
Francisco who live in undergrowth as
dense as the wildest portion of Central
Africa. Ofttimes hours of labor with
pruning knives make but a few yards
of headway through this dense mass
that has sheltered the bird family for
half a century. Some of them are
nesting at heights of over 100 feet,
and the work of reaching the nests is
perilous.
In studying bird life it has been
found necessary to make many photo
graphs of the birds and nests. The
task has been very difficult, but en
thusiasts have accomplished won
ders along this line, as the accompany
ing pictures show. The reproductions
are of several of the most interesting
live bird nictures ever made, but it
has not been a foolish quest, as com
ing generations will learn to their
great benefit.
TENNIS GAINING
IN PUBLIC FAVOR
Crowded Condition of Both
Public and Club Courts
Attests Its Popularity
WILL PLAY INDOOBS
â . â  ' â â  -â¦- â  .'. â 
The ideal tennis weather of the past
two weeks has attracted an unusually
large number of players to both the
park and the California Club courts.
The game is more popular than ever
before, as the crowded condition of the
courts shows.
The most important events to come
are the indoor tournaments. The semi
finals and finals of both the singles and
doubles will be held at the Mechanics'
Pavilion under the auspices of the
Forest, Fish and Game Association.
The preliminary rounds are being
played on the park and California Club
courts. The doubles are under way
at the latter place and the singles on
the public courts.
The only match played in doubles
was that between the Hotchkiss broth
ers and G. Lytton and Fred Adams.
The former team won two sets out of
three. Many matches will be played
in the tournament to-morrow. None of
the best teams will meet in the open
ing round.
Probably the best match will be be
tween Drs. Hill and McChesney and
A. Brabant and S. C. Gayness. The
former should win easily. They should
reach the finals with but little difficulty,
as they drew in the easy half.
Their hardest match will be with Foley
and Dunlap. The semi-final match in
the lower half will be an uninterest
ing one and a poor exhibition. There
is no team in the lower quarter that
could possibly make a showing against
Hill and McChesney. Two of the
teams have not been made up as yet
and the other two are hopelessly out
classed.
Most of the crack teams drew in the
upper half. In the top quarter are
Griffin and Whitney and Schmidt and
Rolfe. These teams are evenly matched
and an interesting match will result
v/hen they come together. One of them
is sure of a place in the semi-finals.
The other semi-final place will prob
ably fall to the Baker brothers. They
will first have to beat Long and Gard
ner and Long and Janes. They beat
both of these teams recently and will â 
probably do so again, although Long
and Janes are not without a chance.
Only seven matches remain to be
played in the preliminary round and
four players have already reached the
second round. Many defaults were
recorded last Sunday. The following
matches have yet to be played in the
opening round: Kenyon vs. Rolfe; Mil
ler vs. Allen; Adams vs. Lowell; Hatch
vs. Whitney; Janes vs. Martin; Fran
cis vs. Dunlap, and Palmer vs. Kuehn.
â¢The four players who have reached
the second round are Gabriel, Major
Van Vliet, Drolla and Griffin. The
second round will probably be finished
to-morrow.
The drawing of the singles is much
more satisfactory than that of the
doubles and in the former event both
semi-final matches should prove inter
esting. Percy Murdock is conceded
one The other place in the lower
half will probably go to Foley, Whit
ney or Janes. In the upper half
George Baker and Gardner will fight
it out for one semi-final place. The
other lies between Schmidt, Rolfe, Bra
bant and Adams. Baker is almost sure
to beat Gardner. The struggle be
tween the other players named will be
an interesting one and it would be dif
ficult to say which will win out.

GOLFING EXPERTS
SHOW ENTHUSIASM
Men Will Try for Amateur
Championship and Women
Hold First Tournament
As the first handicap tournament to
be held by the newly organized Cali
fornia Women Golfers' Association is
to be held on the course of the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club on
Wednesday, April 5, the competition
for the Council's cup for women, the
first round of which is set down on the
schedule for that day, will begin on
Tuesday, the 28th inst.
This is the third and last tournament
to be held during the present season
for the trophy and will almost cer
tainly be the last in which the cup
now being contested for will figure. As
three ladies. Mrs. R. Oilman Brown,
Mrs. J. R. Clark and Mrs. W. G. Miller,
have each two victories to their credit
and a third will make the cup the win
ner's property, it is hardly likely to
survive to be fought for on another
day. Two of the fair competitors have
already announced their determination
to capture the trophy, and the third is,
no doubt, juÃt as full of high resolve.
So a pretty battle may bo expected.
On April 26. 27, 23 and 29 the fifth an
nual competition for the amateur
championship of the Pacific Coast Golf
Association will be held on the links of
the San Rafael Golf Club. Some
changes and improvements are being
made in the course to make it better
suited to a championship event.
The men's amateur championship of
the Pacific Coast Golf Association has
been competed for four times, twice on
the Presidio course, in 1901 and 1903,
and twioe on the course of the Los
Angeles Country Club. In 1901 E. R.
j Folger was champion and John Law
eon runner-up; in 1902 Walter Fair
banks was champion and John Lawson
runner-up; in 1903 C. E. Maud won.
with H. C. Golcher as runner-up; in
1904 A. B. Swift of Santa Barbara be
came champion, with Walter Fair
banks as runner-up.
A tie still remains to be played off
between Mrs. R. G. Brown and Miss
Edith Chesebrough to decide the own
ership of the pretty two-handled silver
cup offered by the directors of the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club as a
prize in an eightcen-hole handicap
against "bogey." In the competition
held last Tuesday Mrs. R. y G. Brown
and Miss Chesebrough tied in eighteen
holes, and on playing nine holes more

Lake County, but the club has not
had any cricket team for the past
two or three years and last year was
not even a nominal member of the as

his constant efforts on behalf of crlc

The question how to secure punc

the visiting clubs so as to enable him
to penalize an eleven that arrives late

the treasury of the association. After
much talk it was decided that the
rules of the association, if enforced,
should prove sufficient.
The secretary of the association, in
response to a request from the Amer

appointed "statistician" to report the

JUDGES RULE OFF
TURF OFFENDERS
LOS ANGELES, March 10.â The
judges at Ascot Park made a ruling to
day that will serve to make owners
careful about asking: jockeys to "place"
horses In races for the benefit of some
book. P. J. Gorman, part owner in a
stable now racing at Ascot; Gerald
Evans, a bookmaker, and J. Costen,
better known around the race tracks as
"Diamond Joe," were ruled off pending
further investigation of charges made
by Jockey M. Lynch.
Lynch sent for Judge Hamilton be
fore the race In which he was to ride
Sinner Simsn last Tuesday and told
the judge that Gorman had approached
him with an offer of $100 if he would
keep Sinner Simon from finishing "in
the money." Judge Hamilton instruct
ed Lynch to say nothing, but to ride
the horsf to the best of his ability.
In the meantime Evar.s' book was
laying top price against Sinner Simon
and taking all the money offered. Sin
ni r Simon won and the book, \vhos*e
sheet was sent for by the judges,
showed that, whereas it had expected
to win $3125 by keeping Sinner Simon
oat of the money, it really loet $2193 on
account of the horse's victory. Neither
Bauer, Gorman's partner, nor Trainer
Davis i* implicated in the alleged
crookedness. '
Four favorites, one well-played Bec
ond choice and a third choice won to
day. The books had a bad day of it.
Weather clear; track fa*t. Summary:
First race, free handicap steeplechase, short

FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Gold Enamel, a speed marvel from
the Wilson stable, went down to de
feat in the afterpiece at Oakland track
yesterday, placing a crlmj) in the tal
ent that a Swedish massage artist will
be unable to rub out. violating union
rules for three months.
The bookmakers daubed up on their
slates the straight and dangerous even
money mark, and forthwith the crowd
started in to make them rub it. At
post time that even money mark was
still plainly apparent to all. standing
out like the Farallon light.
True Wing, well supported at 4, 5 and
6 to 1, did away with the bird of pretty
plumage. Gold Enamel ran second,
beaten a length, Â«nd perhaps McÃride
rode a good race. Opinions differ on
that point. David Boland. Salable and
Ruby cut out the early pace.
PACEMAKERS ARE TIRED.
They were tired somewhat when the
bend for home was reached, and Harry
Birkenruth picked up the running with
True Wing. Later McÃride went after
the Ryan filly with a wet sail, losing
out at the wire by a length in IJljHt.
David Boland finished a good third.
As Montana Peeress was the one fa
vorite to finish first, the layers must
have recouped some of their losses of
the previous few days. The attendance
was large.
A six furlong run for non-winners at
the meeting brought out a field of fif
teen in the opening number. The win
ner turned up in Toltec. ridden by
Bell, which was played from 20 down
to S, and in a drive beat Floriana Belle,
a 60 to 1 chance, less than a length.
Ere Yesterday, another outsider, ran
4hird.
Garnet Ferguson's black horse St.
George Jr., was plunged on at 7 to 5
to win the six-furlong selling affair
next decided and finished second to
Ocyrohe. The latter horse opened fav
orite, receding a shade in the betting,
when the St. George money bobbed
to the surface. 'Big Bill" Knapp rode
Ocyrohe, winning by tnree lengths
from the first choice. F. E. Shaw ran
a close third.
ETHEIi BARRYMORE IS SECOXD.
By a nose only did Jere Dunn's use
ful filly Ethel Barrymore lose the third
race to Mogregor. Both were out
siders in the betting, 10 and 12 to 1
being obtainable about the winner.
McÃride shot Ethel Barrymore to the
front as soon as the barrier was re
leased and only on the last stride did
Larsen get up with Mogregor in time
to receive the verdict. Bell, on And
vari. ran into the show. "Kansas"
Price's Gadfly, backed from 2% to 3
to 2, met with bad luck at the start
and finished a close fourth.
Montana Peeress looked a certainty
for the mile and a elxteenth selling
fixture, and then only clowned Meister
singer half a length, ridden out. Jimmy
Coffey'a mare lid McÃride In the
saddle and went to the post a 3 to 5
chance. Maxetta, a 20 to 1 shot, took
third place.
There sure was some weeping and
wailing when Bell Reed came hop
scotching in ahead of Best Man for
the seven furlong purse. Dr. Rowell's
long striding gelding was held in such
high esteem by the betting fraternity
that the 7 to 10 ffrst chalked was
eagerly snapped up. Bell Reed went
to 9 to* 1 and Jakie Jones had him
out In the lead from start to finish.
Travers came from behind, as usual,
with the favorite, falling short a
length. Budd Wade grew groggy
chasing the winner, finally running
third.
TRACK NOTES.
"Kansas" Price departs with his
stable for Bennings to-night. He had
a big bet down on The Gadfly and
was wrathy over the mishap at the
start.
An accident while at the post in the
third event caused considerable delay.
Wright, who had the mount on Ethel
Barrymore, was kicked on the ankle
by The Gadfly and was replaced by
McÃride. As a piece of the bone was
chipped off. Wright will be out of the
saddle for some days.
Mogregor is back with Charley Me-
Cafferty's string again. When the colt
captured the third purse McCafferty
elevated the selling price from $800
to $900, with no response from Jim
Neil.
Whoa Bill bled while out for his
warming up gallop. All bets were de
clared off by the judges and twenty
minutes allowed for a new book.

POWELL'S BLOWS
LAND HEAVILY
Boli Cairns Puts Up Game
Fight, but Clever Oppo
nent Does Better Work
WOLFF BEATS MAYFIELD
Welters Furnish an Excit
ing Go and the Battle
Is Won in Final Kountl
Lew Powell's victory over Bob Cairns
last night at Woodward's Pavilion was
a well-earned one and came only after
the severest kind of going for four
rounds. Cairns nearly had his man
packed and ready to be stowed away in
the second spasm', but the gritty Powell
was there with a rally, and from that
time he carried the fight right to his
man.
Powell was the cleverer and his leads
came more often. Cairns was always,
ready to bring that deadly right over
Â»nd Lew had co be careful throughout.
The brlndle-heudtd lad's victory really
came in the fourth round, for it was
then he waded in and rained blow after
blow on Cairns' head till the hitter was
about all in.
Frank Maylield and Teddy Wolff fur
nished the best bout of the night. Wolff
won, but he had a hard time bringing
home the coin. Ma"yfield began .to
rough ft early and hfc'was continually
on Wolff's trail. The latter resorted to
cleverness, and it was this that made
him a winner. He nailed Mayfield with
a left In the fourth round that nearly
put the latter out of commission. May
field claimed a foul, but the referee
would not allow it.
Abe Label won from Jack Maguire
simply because the latter refused to go
in and win. Had he led he would have
knocked Label's head off. Mike Synfy,
the terrible Greek, took all the tight out
of Nobby Otts in two rounds. Jimmy
Ford and Jack McÃride put up a des
perate battle and Ford was declared
the winner. N
Willie Edwards was a bit too clever
for Jack Uradshaw, though the latter
fought a good fight and was willing to
go all the time.
"Tangle McGovern" again outpointed
Pierpont Ordway after four rounds of
rough going.
Big Bill Rickards of Chicago, Sam
Bersrer'a next opponent, was Introduced
and received the big welcome. Th<i
bouts were held under the auspices of
the Hayes Valley Club and a big house
was on hand.
GREGGAINS HAS MARCH PERMIT.
BHtt ami Nelson Will Probably Meet
in ApriL
Mayor Schmitz has signed the res
olution granting the San Francisco
Club a permit to conduct a profession
al boxing contest during this month.
The Mayor had fully made up his
mind to veto the resolution, as he
consMered the Yosemite Club was be
ing treated unfairly Inasmuch aa it
was entitled to the March permit ac
cording to the rotation rule in vogue
for some yejirs. The Mayor under
stands that the club managers have
patched up their differences and that
thpy will not oppose the granting of
the April permit to the Yosemite
Club.
It is not certain the Democratic

INVALID ATHLETE TO PROFIT
BY THE EXHIBITIONS
James Dunne Jr., amateur champion
I hard handball player of the world, is
visiting this city in company with his
father, ex-Alderman Dunne of Brook
lyn, N. Y. The son is a worthy suc
cessor to his father as an exponent of
the great Irish game. He has been
playing since a boy and to-day Is the
finished athlete.
Dunne has won innumerable prizes
by reason of his skill as a player. Mike
Egan, the world's professional cliam-
I pion, looks upon the Brooklyn player
i as his closest competitor for the high
est honors. Dunne uses his left hand
with grace and ease, and whenever he
hits the ball it rebounds from the front
wall with terrific* speed. He also uses
an overhand stroke that "kills" in
variably.
To-morrow afternoon Dunne and Al
: Hampton will play James Fitzgerald.
| the ex-champion, and Henry Cary. a
! series of games at the Olympic Club
I for the benefit of Michael Egan. who
| is the greatest exponent of the came.
i Egan is ill in the southland and the
I benefit will aid him financially.
Preliminary to the game "Pa" Dunne.
! who was Phil Casey's . partner years
I ago, when they won the world's cham
j pionship in doubles, will take Jack
Gleason for a partner and will Dlay
the "father of coast handball." J. C.
j Nealon,. and Louis Levy. Mr. Neaion
| is 65 years of age and Mr. Dunne is 63
I years old. These two are wondrrfu'lv
i active fdr their years, and their re
appearance in the court will be the sig
nal for enthusiasm. John Mallon will
j score .the games.
} Supervisors will turn down the Yo
1 semite Club again merely for the pur
; pose of exercising retaliatory meas
ures on Jim Coffroth, manager of the
; club. Some of the Supervisors are
j bitter ag-ainst Coffroth for political
I reasons, if the Yosemite Club contin
i ues to be ignored in the distribution
j of permits Mayor Schmitz says he will
! certainly take a hand In the matter.
His power of veto will bring the dis-
I pute to a head.
It iB a foregone conclusion that
j Coffroth will match Britt and Nelson
, for April, although Britt has a long
j ing in his heart to meet Jabez White,
j the discredited English champion.
Nelson is anxious to meet Britt, but
I there are two points on which he is
determined. Britt must not be al
lowed any bonus which is denied him
and there must be a distinct under
j standing with the referee as to the
] style of fighting. Nelson has heard
: of a referee who was handed $1000
; just before he entered the ring to
judge a fight. He does not want any
1 such incident to happen while he is
I fighting.
SNAILHAM DEFEATS JOHNSON.
Knocks Him Out in the Fourth Round
at Vallejo.
VALLEJO, March 10. â Billy Snail
ham knocked out Bobby Johnson to
night In the fourth round of their
fight. Snallham knocked Johnson
down In the first round with a right
to the head. This took all the steam
out of him and he made a poor show
ing.
Johnson was knocked down again in
the second round. He was clown twice
in the fourth round and claimed he
was hit low. The referee refused to
allow the claim. Johnson appeared in
poor condition for a fight with so
hard an opponent as Snailham.
O'Brien Denies Being Matched.
PHILADELPHIA, March 10. â Phila-
FAMOUS TOUNO HANDBALL. PLATHR WHO IS IN THI3 CITT ON A VISIT
AXD WHO WILL PLAY A SERIES OF OAMES FOR THE BENEFIT OF
MCHAEL EGAN. THE PROFESSIONAL CHAMPION.
delphia Jack O'Brien is out with a de- '
nial that he is matched to fight Tommy :
Ryan before a San Francisco club. ,
O'Brien said to-day:
"I have been in communication with
Coffroth of the Yosemite Club for
some weeks, but nothing has been â 
done. I have an offer from Baltimore |
to box Young Peter Jackson at catch
weights and will take him on if the
Ryan match falls through."
Reflect upon ideals. We have seen
young men who believed they had at
tained to great distinction when they
put on the white apron of a bartender.

tions of seats were reserved for^the
children and their teachers and under
the guidance of competent attaches of
the circus the little ones saw the long
programme of novelties and inspected
the wonders of the menagerie tent.
The engagement of Xorris & Rowe
in this city this year was a splendid
succes. Since the opening over 60,000
persons have paid their way into the
big house' on Larkin street and it is
estimated that with Saturday's and
Sunday's four exhibitions it will
bring the grand total up to over the
80,000 mark. Norris & Rowe have
decided to open their tour every year
about this time and always at the pa
vilion. Next week the show moves
upon the cities of the southern part
of the State and it will again exhibit
under canvas.

MISS ROSMOND SALTAXSTALL
TAKES GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP
Interesting Invalid From the East
Plays Great Game on the
Links at Coronado.
SAN DIEGO, March 10.â Miss Ros
mond Saltonstall of Boston won the
women's open championship to-day at
the golf tournament at Coronado, de
feating Miss Ada N. Smith of this city
by 4 up and 3 to play. There was a
great deal of interest manifested in

by a large- gallery from the first drive.
The first hole was halved, but the
three following were taken by Miss
Saltonstall. She was not headed in
the eighteen holes.
Miss Saltonstall is a member of the
Essex Country Club and of the Brook
line Country Club of Massachusetts.
She Is in the "West for her health, ac
companied by a companion and a maid.
Her ability to defeat the champion
lady golfer of Southern California is
considered the more remarkable as she
has played but six . times upon the
Coronado links. Added interest is at
tached to her because of the fact that
she is a second cousin of Miss Alice
Roosevelt.
The preliminary and semi-finals of
the men's championship were played
to-day. In the forenoon Hugo Johns
ton beat Walter Crosby 5 up and 3 to
play, C. L. Williams beat T. S. Lippy
3 up and 1 to play, Walter Fairbanks
beat Montgomery Ward <> up and 5 to
play, Alexander Reynolds beat W. H.
Eaton 8 up and 6 to play. This after
noon Fairbanks beat Reynolds 3 up
and 1 to play and Williams beat Johns
ton 1 up. The day's play eliminates all
save Fairbanks and Williams, who will
meet to-morrow for the finals. Eight
een holes will be played in the morn
ing and eighteen holes in the after
noon.
AUSTRALIAN AMATEUR RIDER
TO BE SEEN IN THE SADDLE
E. Reay Mackey Is Expected to
Sport the Clark Colors In
Pony Races.
With a perfect track over which to
run it is expected a number of pony
racing records will be broken to-day
at the California Polo and Pony Rac
ing meet over the Ingleside course.
There are six races on the card for
the miniature thoroughbreds.
The principal entries are from the
stables of Rudolph Spreckels, Francis
J. Carolan and Charles W. Clark. The
trainers of the respective strings count
on having the winners in their charge.
Midlove will start for the first time
in the copper colors of Mr. Clark. It
is expected she will be ridden by E.
Reay Mackey, an Australian amateur.
He has had a lot of practice in dis
tance races and between the flags, but
the sprint racing will be a new experi
ence for him. The cleverest of the
gentlemen riders will sport silk during
the day.
Protocol, a, diminutive pony by Jack
Richelieu, under fourteen hands in
height, will also start in the Clark
colors for the first time.
There will be no special train, but
a good streetcar service is promised.
The first race will be called at 2:16.
WESTERN BOWXERS MAY
WITHDRAW FROM LEAGUE
Reported That They Are Not Satis
fled With Domination of
New Yorkers.
SEATTLE. Wash., March ILâ The
Western Bowling League, which took
part in the recent national comDeti
tion in Milwaukee, is expected to with
draw from the national league. The
principal Western cities are said to
concur In the withdrawal proposition.
A meeting of these clubs, which â¦in
clude Butte, Ogden. Salt Lake. San
Francisco, Spokane and Seattle. Is
planned, at which the question will be
definitely settled.
As a reason for the breaking away
from the National Association, the
Western clubs state that the New
Yorkers practically control the leagues
affairs and regulate its dates and rules.
They say that if this condition con
tinues all chance of getting a national
meet at a Western city is lost.

Sour Stomach
'â  â¢I used Cascarats and fÂ«l like â¢ new man. IhaTj
been a sufferer from dyspepsia and sour stomach
for thÂ« last two years. 1 haÂ»Â« been taking medl-
1 elnÂ« and other drues. but could find no relief only
for a snort time. I will recommend CascareM to
my friends as the only thing for indigestion and
â¢our stomach and to keep the bowels la good con-
dition. They are- very nice to eat." .: _

New York Stock Market.
NEW TOHK. March 10. â The breadth as
well as the strength of to-day's stock market
was very notable. While many low-grade and
obscure stocks were numbered among the
gainers the standard dividend-paying railroad
stocks showed revived activity ana strength
end gay* ton* to th* whole market. The
trunk lines and Pacifies particularly came
into prominence ard great activity. The ab
sorption of Pennsylvania was on a very large
toaie. So widespread was the advancing
tendency that the heavy spots are more easily
noted as the exception to the rule. Some of
these were affected by realizing, following
advances yetterday. wb.ch was especially the
caee with Heading. Others were held by a.
torpor which they have been unable to throw
off in suite of the active advances elsewhere.
The United States Steel stocks are conspicuous
examples. The buying was somewhat Inter
mittent and shifted constantly from one point
to another of tin? market. Individual com
mission hous*s executed a large proportion of
the orders in special stocks. Such operations
gave the market a highly professional appear
*noe ar.d suggest the activity of pools and
combinations embarked in a speculative cam
paign- -Th* -market was comparatively free,
however. from rumors concerning special
clocks, such as are usually used by speculative
pools to â¢ â¢;;â  on the advance In their favor
ites. In a few taws there were reports at
special application, such as that the preferred
stock of Hocking Valley was to be retired and
that Amalgamated Copper was to begin the
Issuance of periodical reports of earnings and
financial conditions.
The extraordinary ease of money Is given
ooEt importance in the general field, but Is
effectively supplemented by . the reports c!
the prosperous conditions in trade and in
dustry. Yesterday's reduction in the official
rate -of discount by the Bank of England con
tinued to exercise an influence in keeping up
cor.Sdence in the money market. The fore-
Cists of thÂ« currency movement for the past
vw^k Indicate another shift in the interior
movement in favor of this center, promising
a moderate Addition to the cash item in to
norrow'E bank statement in spite of the ab
sorption on sub-treasury operations. The
figures of the production of gold on the Rand
for February called renewed attention to thÂ»
steady expansion in the rate of gold produc
tion to which the other great gold fields are
also contributing their chare. This is a sub
ject that received attention from time to time
â¢nd â  possible factor in the great rise in
prices of securities. The present heavy ac
cumulations of money reserves in the -world's
grtat centers give point to the discussion. But
urÂ« to th* present time there has been no evi
dence of. the discrimination against fixed in
terest-bearing securities on the part of cap
ital, which is a natural accompaniment of
a fall in the value of the money medium.
Peace procpects continue to form an element
in the strength of markets. ThÂ« buying of
Chesapeake and Ohio became much excited
in the late dealings on the rise to a record
frvel of 58. This served to check th* Irregular
ter.c>ney which bad developed on account ot
selling to realize and made the closing firm.
Bonds were irregular. Total sales, par value.
$4,470,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call. â¢â -"-... :..-

Potatoes Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato Â»market was more liberally sup
plied with fancy Burbanks, but the demand
for that class of goods continued brisk and
prices were wall maintained. Nearly Â«000
sacks came down from Oregon by steamer and
only a Â«mall portion of them were unloaded
in time to be sold. Onions were quiet at
slightly lower prices.
Receipts of Asparagus continued heavy, but
the market was firmer, as in addition to the
regular demand for local use there was a
good Inquiry for shipment to Eastern pointa
and to the north. Rhubarb was plentiful and
prices had a wider range. A good portion of
the receipts were shipped by growera who are
not members of the Association. The other
vegetables were firm for choice offerings.

Poultry and Game.
Receipts of Poultry were hardly sufficient
for requirement*, less than 50 coopa being re

was nothing left in first hands at the cl*e.

Butter, Cheese and Fees.
The weakness in Butter continues and sell
ers continue to give buyers concessions to work
off the stocks. There iÂ« no accumulation and
supplies are not really large, but receipts are
expected to increase materially very soon, and
nobody wants to be caught with a large line
on hand.
Cheese is %c lower and weak at the d*clinÂ«.
with plenty of sellers, but few buyers.
TrÂ»e buying of Eggs in the country haa
reached such large proportions that San Fran
cisco's supply has been seriously diminished,
and in consequence prices continue to rlÂ»e. A
number of houses found themselvea with none
on their floors yesterday. The buying is
especially heavy in Petaluma. Santa Rosa, So
noma. Qllroy and Hollister and is almost
wholly for cold storing. Both stow and ranch

Deciduous and Citrus Fmita.
Trade In Oranges was quiet, but with stocks
comparatively light the market still had a
steady tone and sound offerings of the fancy
grades were firmly held at stiff prices. Two
straight carloads of fancy fruit came in fr>>m
Red!ands and the receipts from other districts
Included very little decayed stock. In the
auction rooms five carloads of fairly attractive
fruit were soli as follows: Fancy Navels.

HYPNOTISM MENTIONED
Latter Witness Says He
Thought an Attorney Had
Him Under Mesmeric Ties
The trial of Allen Ooucher, charged
with the murder of Policeman Eugene
C. Roblxison at Sixteenth and Valencia
streets on January 21, 1902. was on
in Judge Cook's court yesterday. The
croaa-examination of William Hender
son was resumed and kept up for
nearly two hours In an effort to Im
peach his testimony. He stuck to his
story.
During the cross-examination Hen
derson was asked: "Did you not, while
testifying at the trial of William B,
' l^nneciy, say that you were under
hypnotic influenoe?" Henderson re
plied. "I believe I did."
"Were you at that time under
â  hypnotic influence?" was then asked,
; and Henderson replied, "I believe I
was, but my mind is clear now."
At Kennedy's trial Henderson caused
j a sensation, declaring- in court that he
' had been hypnotised by Attorney W.
H. Schooler, one of the counsel who
defended the accused.
Pour other witnesses were examined.
The most important was John J.
Foley, a cadet. He testified that on
the morning of January 21, 1902, he
was on his way home and when he
j reached the corner of Fifteenth and
! Valencia streets he saw the flashes
; from revolvers and heard the reports
! of shots in the direction of Sixteenth
1 street. He saw three men run down
i Sixteenth street in the direction of
| Julian avenue. Then he heard shots,
I followed by running footsteps along
! Julian avenue and up Fifteenth
! street, toward Valencia. Foley became
' frightened, and, seeing a light in a
1 saloon at Fourteenth street, ran
1 toward it. Two men came running
alter him. He knocked on the door
j of the saloon and it was opened by
I Edward Thornton, the proprietor,
i They saw a youth standing on the cor
i ncr, another limping toward him. The
j youth said to the limping man, "Come
! on," using an offensive expression.
Both men had revolvers in their hands.
The youth was of slender build, with
a smooth face and resembled the de
fendant.
Thornton, the saloon-keeper, testi
fied to seeing the youth on the corner
1 and the other man limping toward
him.
Foley*s testimony corroborated Hen
derson, who said that after the shoot
ing: he and Goucher and Frank Woods
ran down Sixteenth street to Julian
avenue, where Henderson was shot
and captured by , Detective Taylor,
Goucher and Woods running along the
avenue toward Fifteenth street. The
limping man was Woods, , who had
been shot by Robinson.
Owen J. McQuade. saloon-keeper.
Sixteenth street and Rondell place, tes
tified to hearing shots and that when
he ran out of the saloon he saw three
men running toward Julian avenue.
He heard some one shout." "Halt!" and
he ran back into the saloon. ,
Henry J. Mahoney testified to hear
ing the shots and picking from the
ground the revolver used by the mur
dered policeman.
At 1 o'clock, as Attorney Recce
Clark informed the court that he de
sired to pay a visit to his ranch, an
adjournment was taken till Monday
morning, when the prosecution will
rest ' â¢ "":â¢. i" I .^ â¢â  â

HAUNTED HOUSE
LOSES FAME
Intrepid Policeman Tears
Mystery to Tatters.
GHOST OPERATED BY BOYS
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Skeptical of i the : possibility of ghosts,
spooks, wraiths, -specters ,or warlocks
having temporal existence, Patrolman
Burke; chuckled to â¢ scorn the ; various
tales told him anent the haunted house
on Sanchez street. . "Go to," r he . invari
ably said to the trembling narrator,
"and wake up. If you . have seen the
thing you j describe it had |no material
being, and you must have been asleep
when it entered your vision." To satis :
fy the most importunate of such in

formants that they had been dreaming
he accompanied them to the unten
anted house and explored it, and not
until last Thursday evening did he fail
to emerge triumphantly empty
handed. Ne'er a disenrmodled spirit
nor the trace of one did he find. And
on the evening 1 referred to he discov
ered nothing of shadowy character.
It was after several trembline per
sons had faltered to him that a fear
some apparition had bowed and bobbed
at them from an upper window of the
house of mystery that the patrolman
perfunctorily decided to Investigate,
his doing so not being inspired by
hope of capturing anything unearthly,
but simply to quell their scare. In
front of the house he found a huddled
crowd of men, women and children, all
gazing in terrified fascination at a
weird object in human semblance that
swayed and courtseyed from a second
story window. It was a long and slim
white figure surmounted by a huge
egg-Bhaped head in which the eyes,
nose and mouth were fiery red, and
every time the head stooped toward
the spectators they shrunk backward
and almost audibly shivered. The
officer afterward acknowledged that
the sight gave him a shock, but did
not rout his disbelief in the super
natural. He immediately entered the
house and ascended the stairway,
where he found two small boys, Gerald
Drover and Ben Edmunds, operating
the wraith and greatly enjoying its
effect upon the throng in the street.
It was made up of a broomstick draped
with a sheet and topped by a large
pumpkin shell inclosing' a lighted
candle.
Judge Fritz dismissed the charge of
disturbing the peace, his decision prob
ably being influenced to some extent by
the reflection that life with be made
rather tempestuous for Masters Drover
and Edmunds by the superstiitious
ones whom they so ruthlessly deceived.
George Lynch disturbed an outdoor
religious meeting on Jackson street,
between Davis and Drumm, last
Thursday evening by assaulting the
Rev. Adolph Rose of Oakland and the
Rev. R. K. Baptista, a Portugese ex
horter. The Rev. Mr. Rose was on his
knees, leading prayer, when Lynch
roughlj r shoved him forward, a per
formance which was repeated with the
Rev. Mr. Baptista as the victim. The
defense before Judge Mogan was that
mischievous persons told Lynch he was
being abused In Portugese by the Rev.
Mr. Bapt'.sta. Sentence deferred till
to-day.

George Foulk, a teamster, accused of
threatening to kin his wife, Edith, said
that her relatives, and not any acts of
his, were responsible for the conjugal
Infelicity. She has many relatives, he
explained, and they made his home life
so miserable by visiting his wife that
he was compelled to leave her and
their three children. The wife, how
ever, declared that George's love of
drink was the cause of the domestic
breakup. Judge Mogan will hear
more of the case next Monday.

When ' 12-year-old Bertrand Ber
trand was called to testify at a burg
lary trial before Judge Cabaniss his
fright was so great that he held up
two trembling little hands while be
ing sworn.
"One hand Is sufficient, my boy,"
said the Judge, in kindly tone; "and
don't be scared."
"No, don't be frightened, my little
man," said Prosecuting Attorney Han
ley, "for his Honor is not a hold-up."
His Honor ignored the testimonial
to his character.
"You must show me," said M. P.
Hagel, peddler, when Patrolman Her
lihy informed him that it was illegal
to obstruct pedestrians at Market and
McAllister streets. "And you must
show me the authority under which
this cod arrested me," he said when
arraigned before Judge Mogan.
"From Missouri, I presume?" re
marked his Honor.
"Yes, sir; came from St. Louis three
weeks ago," was Mr. Hagel's reply.
"You must show me "
"When you come up for sentence
to-morrow," said the bench, "111 show
you â tnough not because I must do
so â that it Is imprudent to block traf
fic and scold policemen."
Frank Frlck, charged with having
purloined a valise from the railway
station at Third and Townsend streets,
demanded dismissal on the ground
that his alleged offense was not com
mitted within the city boundaries.
Judge Conlan suggested that he con
sult a modern map of San Francisco
ere he rails at being pronounced
guilty of larceny.
Arthur Frye, one of three small
boys who were arrested for throwing
sand at persons passing by a vacant
lot on Market street, near Third, con
fessed that it was not his first appear
ance as a defendant. "I was copped
once before," he told Judge Mogan,
"for mysterious mischief, but de
Judge let me go."
"There doesn't seem to have been
any mystery about the mischief now
charged against you," said the Judge.
Sentence to-day.

Ed Phillips, rated A. B. on the
books of the. battleship Ohio, pleaded
that he considered himself perfectly
justified in being armed with the re
volver which was taken from him by
Patrolmen Tillman, Ruggles and Bo
lan when they arrested him for dis
turbing the peace in a Third-street
saloon. His resistance of the officers,
he added, might also be pronounced
condonable for the same reason,
which he would explain If Judge
Fritz would permit him to do ho.
He dropped Into the saloon, he said,
to buy a drink for himself and there
saw four men whom he recognized as
de.erters from the Ohio. They im
mediately accosted him with a re
quest that he "set 'em up," and when
he objected to treating persons who
had violated their oath to serve Un
cle Sam they fell upon him and he
was roundly beaten. When he escaped
their clutches he hied him to a pawn
shop, purchased a pistol, loaded it and
returned to the saloon, his object be
ing to renew the combat with the
odds against him reduced by his pos
session of the firearm. His assailants
had departed, however, and while he
was expressing his opinion of them
the three policemen undertook to dis
cipline him. If they had understood
the real situation, he thought, they
would have handled him less roughly
when he objected to being deprived
of his shooting iron.
He was given twenty-four hours'
imprisonment.

sequently he ascertained that Ratchem

Emergency Hospital laÂ«t night, in
urgent need of surgical attention. Pos
sibly because of the lack of such at
tention one of them 1b dead.
The surgeon on duty, Dr. Glover, was
unable to give them more than tem
porary relief without violating a rule
of the Board of Health, which says
that the chief surgeon shall be notified
of all major cases and that he alone
can perform such operations. Dr.
Stephen, who holds the chief sur
geon's position, could not be found.
David Thomas, a laborer, was run
over by a Third-street car at Third
and Silver streets. Hlb right arm was
badly torn. The bones were sticking
out in two places. The man was weak
from the shock and from loss of blood.
Dr. Glover said an amputation of the
arm at the shoulder should be per
formed. The steward was Instructed
to ring up the chief surgeon. His wife
answered and said she did not know
where her husband was. For four
hours the hospital attendants tried to
find the chief, without avail.
Meantime two fractured skull eases
came In. John Deehan, a miner, liv
ing at 810 Mission street, fell down a
night of stairs at that place and suf
fered a fracture of the skull. His case
was a hopeless one, being a fracture
of the base of the skull. Deehan died
at 1 a. m.
Thomas Kenny, a waiter, fell down
a night of stairs in a lodging-house at
789 Folsom street and suffered a frac
ture of the frontal bone of the skull,
an operation needing immediate atten
tion.
The Board of Health enforces the
following rule:
The assistant surgeons shall notify thÂ« chief
surgeon of all aertous cases, including those
of hips, gunshot wounds penetrating the. abdo
men, fractures of skulls and cases requiring
major operations as soon as they are admitted
to the hospitals. The chief surgeon is re
quired to perform all capital operations.
Dr. James Ward, president of the
Board of Health, offered his services
when Informed that the chief could
not be found and gave Dr. Glover the
power to use his own discretion at a
late hour, when all hope of finding Dr.
Stephen was abandoned. He said: "Dr.
Stephen should certainly have left his
whereabouts known."
Dr. Sidney Worth, a member of the
Board of Health, was very much con
cerned over the Inability of the hos
pital attendants to find Dr. Stephen.
He said: "Dr. Stephen should always
be where he can be found. Isn't he a
married man? Where can he be at
this hour of the night? I shall make
an immediate investigation and have
this matter remedied."
Dr Ward says he will also conduct
an investigation. At 1 o'clock this
morning no one had been able to find
Chief Stephen, after five hours' try-
