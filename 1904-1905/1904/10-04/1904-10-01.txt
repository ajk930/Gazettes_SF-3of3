recently befell Miss Mabel Wilson, who
makes her home In Petaluma.
At a time when Miss Wilson was
known to be visiting in San Francisco,
a young woman bearing the same
name committed suicide there. A sis
ter of the Petaluma girl was satisfied
that It was Mabel Wilson of Petaluma.
who had elected to leave this world,
though she could assign no reason for
the rash act. Her father was of the
same belief and he procured a casket
at his home In Ukiah and sent an offi

bring back the remains of his daughter.
In the meantime Mabel Wilson ap
peared at her home in the flesh, and
the official and casket were hurriedly
recalled from San Francisco. What will
be done with the coffin purchased is

. In a fortnight's time General . KuftÂ»
patkin will be reinforced by eight
hardy corps from the best equipped
fighting force of Russia, i Until then he
Is not -likely/ according to. competent
military authorities, to give battle.
The change of tactics on the part of
the Japanese; by attacking all along
the line, renders General Stoessel's task
doubly difficult. He cannot longer call
out reserves and concentrate them on
one spot, as was the' case heretofore.
The. military critic of Novoe Vremya
says this increases the chances .of
Japan's success.

Boy's Leg Broken by a Milk Wagon.
-Everett- Call, a boy of 7 years, living
with' his parents at 232 Fern avenue,
was struck by a milk wagon belonging
to the San Pedro dairy yesterday
afternoon at' the crossing of Polk
street and Austin avenue. The boy was
in the act. of crossing Polk- street,
when the horse and wagon dashed out
of Austin avenue and before he could
clear he\ was knocked down, the
wheels of the wagon passing- over hia
leg" and breaking it. At the Emer
gency Hospital the broken bone was
set. and he was then removed to his
home.
.-Â¦ The autopsy on the remains of Ma
jor Thomas B. Adams, U. S. A., who
died from, injuries- received by being
struck by a- car at Post and Powell
streets,.- showed that in addition to a
fracture of the skull, six upper ribs
on the right side and the right clav
icle were also fractured. These in
juries escaped the attention of the
surgeons at the Central Emergency
Hospital, as in their diagnosis entered
on the- official register only the injury
to. the- head was noted. Dr. Baciga.
lupi, the autopsy- surgeon at the
Morgue, states that death was due
principally to. traumatic pneumonia.
In his opinion, if proper treatment
had been given the life of the of
ficer might have been saved. He does
not believe that the fracture of the
skull alone would have caused death.

HOUSTON, Texas, Sept. 30Lâ A
woman claiming to be Mary Kingston,
who disappeared twenty years ago, and
has since been believed to be dead, has
turned up. laid claim to being the
mother of a young lady also named
Mary Kingston, and to being the owner
of extensive real estate possessed by
the girl in the valuable portion of the
Batson Prairie oil fields. Her claims
are vigorously disputed. The young
lady has denounced the older woman
as an impostor. A sister of the woman,
who disappeared years ago, also de
nies the newcomer's claims, bjit ' a
brother, John Carson, testifies that the
woman is really their long missing
sister.
A suit for possession of the young
Miss Kingston's property was tiled by
the elderly woman, and after three
days' trial came to an end this evening.
As an identification, it was recalled
by the sister that the real Mrs. King
ston, when a little girl, had acciden
tally chopped off the tip of a big toe
and that the toenail had grown straight
downward over the end of the remain
ing stump. Mr?. Kingston removed the
shoe and stocking from her right' foot
for the inspection of the court and
jury- The result was mystifying, for
instead of the large toe showing the in
jury, the. one next to it appeared to be
mashed off. â¢. J '. -Â¦ ' -. :

BERLIN, Sept. 30.â In the next num
ber of Its publication the German Navy
League will create a navy scare for
propaganda purposes. It will be shown
that the thirteen new battleships of
the United States, armed with twelve
guns of more than 23 centimeter cali
ber, would be able to destroy the armor
of Germany's greatest battleships be
fore their Inferior suns could reach
an effective range.
Accordingly the 1900 navy plan will
be represented as out-of-date and de
manding replacement by a new marine
organization with far stronger battle
ships. Besides, the league points out
that the American ships now being
built constitute a mighty fleet, able to
cope with the whole German navy. The
scare Is believed to foreshadow naval
proposals during the ensuing session
on a far greater scale than was an
ticipated.

junction against the members of the
Leadville Mining District Association*
restraining the association from pro
ceeding further to compel miners to

ing against any miner because of his
being a member of the Western Fed

a blacklist, or from compelling; mem
bers of the federation to abandon the
organization, or from compelling them
to sign any agreement that they will
renounce membership in the federa

SENATOR XEWLAXDS.
As election day approaches the in
dications multiply that California will
elect a solid Republican delegation to
the next Congress. Judge Conley, the
Democratic candidate in the Sixth Dls-
trict, is not a vote-getter, or a whirl
wind campaigner. Official returns of
election show that he runs behind his
ticket.
Yesterday General Stone, chairman of
the State Central Committee, was,
asked. to give his views concerning- the
outlook in the First and -Second Con
gressional districts. In reply he said:.
"I am thoroughly convinced that J.
N. Gillette's majority in the First Dis
trict will be at least 3500, and that
Duncan E. McKinlay will carry â¢ the
Second District by 2500 majority.. This
is not conjecture, but a prediction'

Affairs in San Joaquin County con
tinue to engage the .attention of lead-
Ing politicians. There Is an erroneous
rmpreesion that this county belongs to
the .Democratic column because X.ane
received a majority of 75 in the last
gubernatorial election. In the State
election of 189S San Joaquln gave the
Republican nominee for Governor 87G

of 1900 McKlnley carried the county by

In San Joaquin County ' will approxi
mate 1000. In 1902 the head of the'Re
publican ticket. -Governor Pardee, was
knifed by State and Federal* office,
holders and the raiiroad machine. In
this campaign harmony prevails in -the
Republican camp. ' The supporters of
Dunlap for State Senator were out
voted at the recent primary election
and the nomination went to A: E.
Muenther, but the' Republicans who
stood by Dunlap now .stand for the
whole Republican ticket," although they
have knowledge' that Duniap's defeat
was brought about by the activity of
one department of the Federal service
and railroad interference.
Estimates of the California majority
for Roosevelt range from 40,000 to' 50,
000. .. The marvelous increase of regis
tration in Los Angeles County prompts
a revision of the first estimates made
by the political experts. A plurality of
15.000 for Roosevelt and Fairbanks in
Loe Angeles County would not cause
surprise at party headquarters. The
number of registered voters this year
Is 66,000, an increase of 19,000 over the

To a Call correspondent Senator Hoar
once said: "If any thins should ever
harden to me Mr. Moody is regarded
ss rny logic al Fucrowor. It Is my wish
that he should be."
This and other reasons lead to- the
opinion here that Governor Bates of
Massachusetts will designate Attorney
General Moody to serve out Senator
Hoar** term. It is understood that
former Governor Murray Crane is* not
In t-ueh health as would permit his

presided.
During: the day the Fairbanks party
crossed the State, arriving in this city
at 6:30. The speeches of the day were
made at Prosser, North Yakima, El

which they believed clearly belonged to uÂ«.
The American commissioners were willing that
the subject of proper delimitation of the line
should be referred to six Jurists of repute,,
three Â¦ of whom were to be chosen by the
United States and an equal number by Great
Britain and that the decision of a. majority

here to-night Senator Fairbanks dis
cussed at some length the settlemerft
of the Alaskan boundary dispute. Im

Slade declares that Caryl worked a
similar scheme in Denver about eight
years ago with some old mining claims
and that the widow of the manu
facturer of "pink pills for pale people"
dropped over $100,000 . in the scheme.
On that occasion the company was
named the "New Era Union."
One of the chief reasons for not issu
ing the warrant was the fact that the
promissory notes given by Rockwood
will not be due till January 1, 1907, and
Caryl could put up a defense that they
would be met at maturity.
Caryl went to Los Angeles In No
vember, and -rumors were started that
everything was not right. Slade wrote
to Caryl, who has an office at 407 West
Twelfth street, saying that the mem
bers were beginning to suspect thct
they had been deluded. He received a
reply that they were not deluded but
"obsessed." That was all the satis
faction Slade could get.
Slade says he went to the St. Louis
exposition, and on his way back he
stepped off at Denver and asked the
opinion of eight different real estate
men as to the value of the land owned
by Caryl, and the answer was about
the same in" each Instance, namely,
that $tSOO would be a fair price, or
$1200 less than the original mortgages.
The â¢ theory, was attractive and many
.took shares, of stock In the scheme.
Slade says he Is out of pocket to the
extent .of $1200 and there are many
more, Including attorneys, dentists and
mechanics and a host of women, whose
contributions amounted .to over $8000.
One wpman had lived on 15 cents a day
for years, thereby saving; $1000, which
Bhe put into the scheme.-
Caryl came here from- Denver In
May, 1903. and gave lectures, in Golden
Gate Hall. Slade says that Caryl is a>
man of strong psyschlc power and
soon w'on over his hearers. His propo-'
sition was to build a town on the co
operative plan on land that he* owned
near'. Denver, which he claimed was
worth about $26,000. A company named
the Vril Industrial System was formed
and Slade was made president of the
executive committee.
Af Caryl's suggestion E. R.-Rock
wood and D. B. Hall were sent at his
expense to Denver to examine Into the
value of the land, and they returned
and reported that the valuation placed
on It by Caryl was correct. Each mem
ber was to get promissory notes pay
able, in three years from Rockwood,
who was made a sort of trustee, Caryl
giving Rockwood a mortgage, on the
property. There were mortgages al
ready on the land to the value of $6000
and it was agreed that these mort
gages would be paid off by subscrip
tions from the members. In this way
$1000 was paid off, leaving $5000 still
unliquidated.
LEAVES THE CITY.
According to Slade, Caryl had a
large following In this city and in
duced many persons to part with their
coin. He was not a smooth talker, but
on the contrary seemed a man with
many ideas which he found difficulty
in expressing. His strong point was
his pretended knowledge of an agency
which he designated as "vril" or elec
tricity extracted from the air..
Scientists, Caryl said, had discovered
a. method of harnessing the vagrant
electricity without the use of expensive
machinery and wonders could be
worked with it. He held the secret,
but was under solemn pledge that the
discovery- was .to be made use of only
for .the benefit of mankind and that
capitalists generally might not profit
by it. -In his co-operative' colony mills
would be operated, the land plowed
crops harvested and all things done by
the power of '.'vril." The "vril" and its
wonder-working powers recall forcibly
to mind Bulwer-Lytton's book,- "The
Coming RaceV wherein a similar force
is used by strange people having its
habitat in the hollow .center .of the
earth.
MANY ATTRACTED.
J. W. Slade, 444 Jones street, who
claims to be a victim of a proposition
to build a town near Denver on the
co-operative principle, called upon
Captain Martin yesterday and asked
for the arrest of Charles W. Caryl, the
originator of the scheme, on a. charge
of obtaining: money by false pretenses.
Slade was referred to Bond and War
rant Clerk Fitzpatrlck, but as Slade
hesitated to put up the funds to bring
Caryl back from Los Angeles and for
other reasons the warrant was not
issued. ' -

was .continued until October 3. when
she will have opportunity to prove her
assertion that she was no stranger to

Miss. Henry averred that was all bosh.
She did acknowledge. that she captured
his hat. as he tried, to elude her and
escape -on a passing street car, but she
did that simply to prevent him leaving

Humane Officer Hooper pronounced
Joseph Moore's horse the most at
tenuated eauine he had ever seen In
active service. So gaunt was its frame,
indeed, that the ribs almost sliced the
skin and one could have played a xylo
phone solo upon them. Mr. Moore de
clared the horse was amply fed and
hinted that its ribs were shoved out
by food pressing against them. If
the animal failed to lay on surface fat
he (Mr. M.) could not help it. Judge
Mogan then continued the case in or
der to consult veterinary experts as to
whether it is possible for a horse to
confine Its fattening to its interior.
Case continued till next Monday,
when Miss Johnson may be called to
tell, what she knows about it.
"Dar wui no "splcion In man mine

Mr. Lopez then declared that Mr.
Williams annoyed Miss Johnson to
such an extent that she appealed to
him (Mr. L.) for protection and when
he politely requested Mr. Williams to
leave the floor he was viciously at
tacked by that gentleman. As to the
alleged club-wielding, Mr. Lopez ad
mitted that he indulged in it, but not
until after Mr.' Williams had armed
himself with a. chair. He was at a loss
to account for Mr. Williams' rude
treatment of Miss Johnson, who was
noted for her gentleness of manner.
The orchestra was playing and some
of the ladies were singing? "Jimmie,
Jimmie, That's the Name They
Gimme," and, as Mr. Williams' bap
tismal name was James, he may have
taken offense at the music and words.
It was difficult â¢ to .4 assign any other
reason for . his ungallant . behavior
toward a lady of Miss -Johnson's en

brain him with 'a heavy club..

Si Francisco.
Scores of representative citizens
of San Francisco are testifying oa
the following subject. Such a record
of local indorsement is uneqaaled in
modern times. This public statement
made by a citizen is but one of the
many that have preceded it and
hundreds that mtU , follow. Read it:
F. M. TucL-v, dairy farmer, of
737 Howard street, says: "Trouble
with the kidney secretions to me
was a fruitful source of annoyance.
Sometimes continence or stoppage
was very marked; sometimes the
action was too often and the quan-
tity too profuse. In addition to this
I had backache every now and then.
Matters had gone on like this for
some years, and although t con-
stantly tried to get rid of the cause
I was unsuccessful until I used
Doan's Kidney Pills. What I saw
in an advertisement which induced
me to take a course of the treatment
was true, for the pills acted exactly
the same in my. case and a cure was
the result."

there 'are. .many models, maps, photo

encounter Jn his workings, in the
draughtlng-rpom Is a large collection
of State and county maps, and in
quiries about the geology or topogra
phy of if.e country are there an-'
swered. State Mineralogist Aubury has
devoted much time and thought to
making these various sources of infor
mation practical and accessible. Suc
cess has resulted largely.
Supplementary to the showcas.es and
the catalogues are county- registers,
each, ot which shows for some particu

Considering that gold is produced In
thirty-five California .counties out of
fifty-seven^ and -that there are 250 spe
cific minerals that- ha-ve been found in
California^ it is manifest that there is
.variety, As well as abundance, in the
collection that is spread" ouffgr the
benefit, of the public. The' mineral col
lections are attractive to sightseers.
They show' manufactures, miners, capi
talists and the general public, the. qual
ity and character of the 1 economic min
erals of. the State and. where- they are
to be found: " â¢' â¢ .
Th era- .are now -more, than sixteen
thousand . 'specimens of the mineral
products of California in the museum
of the . State' Mining \ Bureau, . in" â¢ the
ferry building af the' foot of Market
street, in this city. One of the. largest
free exhibition halls in the c.ounjry is
â¢well filled with, the cases that contain
these specimens, and the mineral show
has reached such size . that it cannot
find room in the hall, b.uf a part is in
the adjoining corr.idors. Here is- a per
manent exhibit of Californian creation
that Â¦ Is -equipped .with" all possible
â¢'guides to assist the seeker for infor
mation of a definite sort Every, sam
ple is numbered, and descriptive cata
logues.are convenient for use in. which
every sample is described, the nura
"bers in the catalogues and those in the
cases corresponding. The list of mln-'
1 erals alone js so Ions that it has not
been found feasible to have it in 1 one
'volume. The additions to the museum
average inore than a .hundred a year.
One .volume of f the . catalogue, the
latest to be printed, contains descrip
tions of 2000 samp.les.. The others are
in accompanying volumes. Â¦
The educa-tional val-ue of this may
be easily perceived. In the first place
the museum is open to the general
public every secular day In the year,
with -.the exception of legal holidays.
In the next place, attendants are pres- ;
eni to supply 'all possible information
to thos<* who seek to know anything
in addition- to vrhat they can learn by
an inspection of the 'samples in the
cases and elsevrhere. Recently a large
collection of "gold'and copper ores, the

for a divorce, charging him with vari

Mrs. La\*rrenceÂ« procured * an order of.

could no longer bear with her .hus

been coupled with use of hls'flsts and
she would not ' tolerate such conduct.
Hubby, however, was e?postulant with
denials. He admitted that there had
been a fuss, but only such a disturb

many a family. Still, in an odd mo

on October 12/ .1S54. They had been
playmates in childhood in .Kentucky,
but when, the girl came to California
with, her family in. 1849 Gentry thought
a childhood romance was ,at- an end.
In a few years, however, she returned
and at the. age of 17 was married to
her prei*ent husband. Eight years they
lived together, children were born and
.a happy home was the outcome of the
match, but when the Civil War 'came
husband and- wife were ranged ori op
posite sides of the conflict.
'Her sympathies were, with the North,
his with the Southland in a fit of tern-,
per following a discussion . of the
slav'ery issue Gentry "left home and
w.ent'-to the war, joining the Confed
erate forces. He did' not return, even
-when the war had closed. Mrs. Gen
try, .believing that he -had been killed
or* had deserted her, obtained a divorce
in. 1874. She came to California with
Â¦her children, one of whom married, a
!!?. Carpenter. The other is an en
gineer employed by the Standard Oil
Company in San Ffancisco, and living
at 512 Sixth street in this city. â¢ : 1 ;
Mr. Gentry., too,' came to California.
He says- he built the first house con
structed in' the Yosemite.- He resided
with his daughter here. His former
wife was in the" same city, but they
did not .come together again until their
accidental meeting on the ferryboat.
"We are Christians now," said the
aged, lady to-day, "and we thought It
fit. that the past be buried and that we
live together again as husband and
wife, it is better that way." . â¢
Separated in 186? when Civil War
issues -.rent; more than one home, and
divorced ten years after the war, John
and Martha Gentry were rejnarried to
day, both* being: so old and feeble that
it .was '.with -difficulty -they carried out
the- forms . required: by law; Justice of
the Peace; Geary performed the cere
niony;- 1 Jlrs.iGentry giffned the County
Clerk's roll for. her husband. His hand
shook so .that . he could not write his

NO. onevneed be. surprised that: dissension- has appeared at St.
:31ou'is between Southern- and Northern California,' It was to
.-.: - lÂ»c expected and must be accepted vÂ» : th philosophy: South
ern California has, with wonderful enterprise, an optimism that
.survives .misfortune and an energy 'that no; reverse can impair,
proceeded to make the utmipst out ojf what-' resources she has. . Her
pood, taste and her necessities have combined to produce all the
charms that are in garniture and ornament. Every- spot that can
be made beautiful is made to shine, and- even the small towns' are'
dressed always in; holiday garb. Wherever enough water can be
had to make an ornamental tree live- or a flower bloorii, there' may
be found the tree and fhe : . flower. The prevailing .spirit is. upon
architecture,'- and every building is constructed for. the eye as well
as for occupancy. . : '. ' â¢ . - * -. â¢ '
-..- Instead "of Exciting jealousy, all .this is commendable' and
Â¦worthy of praise: Southern California is, and is to remain, the
Â£reat..show place .of the Western Hemisphere. There is no rival.
There is no other section where all outdoors is so well converted
into, an attractive .landscape to catch the : eye and enchain the fancy.
Such a reviving rainfall as- Northern California has would be a
misfortune in Southern California, and such a lack of.- moisture as
Southern California has- would send Northern California to the
pOorhouse. Southern, California's destiny is not commercial nor
productive primacy,, but father the winning of. millions. from all the
world by the improved beauty and blandishments, which, will .always

climate for health and for physical enjoyment; That section of the
S^tate is a spyt of. enlarged: and outdoor .Paris,'. and its -greatness in

annual meeting atf JUisa.' â¢'Wes.Vs school
Friday, afternoon.-' "there was." * very

several of ;W.hom read reports" \6t their

complishments of these different -'so
cieties toward ' the ' heeds, of Incompe
tents- is deserving of the greatest praise
and is Indeed "sweet charity" In Its
fullest meaning.- â¢ ' â¢
Among the statements offered on
Friday perhaps the mo.st Interesting
was that of the president Qf the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society. He said that
oftentimes parents brought children
there^-boys usually â to be disciplined
or- guided; that they did- not obey at
home and were truants from school and
more often than otherwise, he discov
ered that these same : children were
not bad so-much as 111. manage'd.' PutÂ£
llc schools often pushed children,- be
yond their capacity, and 'forced slow
minds to be' quick-, with disastrous re
sults, The child became discouraged
or defiant, according 'to- his nature and
rebelled In some . form. Again many
children of tender years .were : forced
by. parents- to. earn money unnecessa
rily, .thus denying to them rightful.ed
ucation or. recreation. The "Aid Society
has" helped arid placed In .'proper post
tions many; boys whp have -.been "xriiB
guUe\i;-and the girls are all eagerly;
sought 'and -have, been, provided with
good j!J^ldt^Â»*^TB<iBi^^arfeijUuEdrnil

(( TF my left forearm had

the third round I should
have knocked Guns .out. As it
was -I nearly made him quit. I
could not use my left arm and
did all my fighting with my
right. He couldn't hit hard
enough to hurt me. Punishment
never hurts me. . At ho time
during the fight* did Gans have
me in distressl I went after
bim in every round' and landed
often on him. dans is a clever
boxer, but 'has- no punch. If I
had not hurt my left hand while
trafnhig I should have beeÂ» all

it was broken, 'but I guess it is
merely a strained tendon. The

By New York Morning; Telejcraph,
Walcott made a wild men across the
| ring when the gong sounded in the
seventeenth round. He made a swing
at Gans and m'iFsed" end then sot a
right to the head and another to the
body. Walcott lahded a right to the
body which seemed to hurt Gans,. who
rested up for' the remainder the
round. Gans did -not seem much at
his ease in. the eighteenth round, but at
the end he landed a right and left to
the head which staggered Walcott. The
nineteenth and twentieth ' were full -of
earnest fighting. Neither man could
land the decisive blow. Both came up
for the last round apparently fresh af
ter all tHeir exertions. Gans scored
with right and left to the head and
body repeatedly. â¢
After the preliminary boxers left the
ring .Walcott and Gans appeared and
were greeted with eheers. A scale was
lifted to the â¢ ripg platform and . the
two men. minus even their- ring cos
tumes, and in ' m bare feet mounted .the
scale In turn " and came within the
.weight limit. 'Announcer '. 'Billy" Jor
dan raised his clarion voice and said:
"Both men . have weighei! - under 141
pounds." Qane weighed 136>Â£ pounds
when he left San "Rafael yesterday.
Gans retired to his corner and waited
WALCOTT'S WILD RUSH.
Both men were angry in the efghth
round, during* which they slugged all
over- the ring. Walwtt held "on. in the
ninth round and saved himself from
punishment, although Gans went after
him 'in an attempt to stop" him. Gans
beat Walcott to. several blows. ' Wal
cott missed one swing and stepped into
a hard right.. The thirteenth was Wal
cott's round, as he tried rough tactics,
which Gans could not avoid. The six
teenth was one of- the hardest rounds
of the right. Walcott did some effec
tive work in the clincnes- and kept
Gens 'on the defensive. - " . Â¦*.
later oft in th'e fight arrd Gans gave
his opponent a gentle shoye after head
ing him in the Tight direction.

There were criee for Britt and Jim
my responded; He trij>ped^ through the
.ropes with his accustomed grace and
was announced as "Â«he only â¢ Jimmy
Britt.". Gans strode from his corner
and grasped James by his right
"mitt," and then Jimmy, in order not
to enow any partiality, shook "hands
with Walcott. When the noise had
ceased James niade a bo.w, and, rais
ing his voice, said:
"Gentlemen, I will. he brief. I know
you all want to see the fight. About
a week ago I agreed to flght Mr. Gans.
There is no reason why I won't fight
him and I am still open to flght him."
'There, was further cheerteg.- The
men posed for the customary pictures
and at 9:35 the gong sounded the open
ing of the' battle. â¢ -.
When the tickets- and money . had
been counted the box - office statement
showed there was a â¢ $6688 gate. The
San Francisco ; Athletic Club, under
: whose auspices the men fought, al
lowed the men 55 per cent of the gross
receipts. This was to bo divided 75
pÂ«f cent to 'the victor and 25 per. cent
Â¦to ?.he loser.. The -draw decision -brought
about a division of, the 'purse,.; The
Jack " Johnson was . introduced and
modestly acquiesced when Announcer
Jordan said he would fight any man in
the .world. Visions of Jeffries did not
scare the intrepid negro heavyweight.
BRITT IS INTRODUCED.
for things to commence: ' "
Walcatt created a great deal of dis
pleasure by returning to- his dressing
room ' and remaining' there for fully
half an hour. The "Barbados- ponder"
needed some stimulant, naving fasted
In order that he mfght make the"pre
scribed weight. Gans grew nervous
over the delay and the crowd more so.
After, much hooting* ana -jeering- Wal
cott re-entered the arena. Gans was
introduced, as the. "lightweight cham
pion of the world" and Walcott as the
"welterweight champion of the world."
. "Kld - * was also presented and- during
thc announcement "Billy Pierce" and AI
Hereford became, involved in a* quarrel
in Waicott's corner. Pierce pushed
Hereford back and Her*ef<>rd expostu
lated-with him. The dispute .was over
{he bandages worn by Walcot.t.- It ap
peared that Walcot.t had .an inch of ad.
hesive- plaster over his "right knuckle
and â¢Hereford feared it might do dam
age if It landed on Gan"S;jaw. Aftfr
â¢a heated argument, during which it
seemed, the battlewould notÂ«take place,
Walcott removed his Vlump of piaster"
and the men girded themselves for the
fray. - - : ,

".Twin" : Mike Sullivan - proved his
superiority as a .fighter over. Joe Angeli
after seven rounds of fierce battling.
Angeli was sent down .for the count- in
the. sixth round, but pluckily came
back for more and Sullivan hammered
him until Joe dropped; Captain of
Police .Anderson signaled Referee
"Spider" Kelly to stop the fight and
Sullivan" was awarded a decision. Sul
livan was. too clever and- shifty for his
smaller opponent. Angeli made a grand
showing and was roundly cheered for
his pluck" and dash. Sullivan was a
seasoned ring general and hit Angeli
where he pleased. Sflllivan did .. not
make. many friends by his victory be
. cause -he wore . a ' protector over his
stomach. He winced under body # pun*
ishment and the crowd yelled, for An

not capable of turning : the - trick. It
was a. splendid prellmlnary,and proved
"a good appetizer foi^the -treat that fol
lpwed. . ' â¢ ' .
. Walcott commenced forcing matters
in trie first round, but Gans -was right
on top' of -him all the time and landed
by far the greater 'number of clean
blows. . There was. a slugging Â¦ match
tiear the end- of the round and when
t-his "ended ' Ganst jstaggered Walcott
with a right to the "head. He also hit
.him after jibe -gong sounded. but it was
unintentional. "Cans was the first to

Walcott" missed one wild swing that
would have doÂ»ie damaga had itlland

with a slugging match in which Gans
â¢proved the. most effective. Gans walk

j'jst as the gong sounded the end of
the sixteenth round, Qans started a
blow , for WalcotU =At the bell Referee
WC-ich Stepped into range. He caught
the full force of . the blow, on the ja\v
and was completely dazed, for a few
rnomeats. â¢ Gans' took 'the accident
greatly to "heart.. Instead of going to
bis corner, he .apologized to the' ref
eree, explaining it was entirely unin
tentionar and that he regretted if very
much. ' Gans went to hig corner, but
.was; kq! -much upset by the -accident
that he. would "not. sit" down.- He
walked across" the riris; and again. apol
ogized. Some of the -Fpectatofs thoiigbt

VVAI-jCOI^T SURPltlHESGAXS. â¢ â¢
The bout was cne of the. most spec
tacuiar ever se*a .here, the men show
ing boxine: ability of the highest order
and marked aggressiveness. Gans. is a
consummate- ring ffeneraf, never mak
ir.a; an ynae^ary move and "being- a
snaryel â¢ 'jat'. blocking. ]Â¦'-
He landed countless blows on Wal
cott's jaw and head and â¢ body." \ but
they seemed -to have no - effect on the
Eawpd-oa: fjghter. Orce he caught Wal
xott .a right uppe.rcut. ,which lifted him
on his toes, but" WaJcott never lost
'iris .balance, -coming back fighting.
Gans . devoted all his attention in the
earlier round's to' Waicott's head, but
later on Switched to" the body. He
reduced' Waicott's hitting ability to a
minimum", by. never Jetting him get' set.
Thus the majority of theJblows which
Walcott. landed were sent from some
awk.ward angle arid reducing the pun
ishing power. Cans' . judgment of dis
.tance and .of the timing of his blows
was â¢ perfect. Severa 1 times he sa w - -a
blow" would not reach -the poin.t for
which. H was. intended and he would
draw it back. . Â¦. Â¦ '
FIGHT IS SPECTACULAR.
After the ;fi?ht Walcott claimed he
injured his left forearm .in the thirji
round and otherwise he would
have beaten Gansi When the arm
Tvas examined at the Receiving: Hos
pital by Dr.: Miller;, the surgeon found
that the ligament of the .left arm had
been torn loose at thewrisL He says
it will be many months before Walcott
will be able to' ngrht again. ' â¢ -
Walcott hurt . the arrn some days
since in training. Gans. blocked many
of his desperate, swings with his el
bow, and it was on one of these occa
sions that the injury was-.done.
Referee Jack" Welch called the
Gans-Walcott fight a dra\r* last night
In Woodward's Pavilion to the sur
prise of practically every . spectator in
tixe house. There was & roar of disap-.
provai when the referee raised both
hands in the air signaling a draw. The
tumult died away, quickly and .was fol
lowed by an animated discussion." The
consensus of opinion wais - that Gans
outpointed "WaJcott for fifteen of the
twenty desperate rounds ftught by the
colored gladiators. :'; Â¦':.
The referee justified his action by
eaying that- Gans had a slight lead,
but that he considered' the aggressive
ness of WaJcott balanced this and en
titled him to a draw.- . '. Â¦* 'Â¦

Worth offered no special attraction and
the downfall of favorites was the chief
feature.; In the third â¢ race . at a mile
and fifty yards. S. G. !HUdreth's Floyd
.K.was made the short-priced choice at
3 to 2 and failed to finish inside the
money.. Chanterelle at 20 to 1 shocked
the. talent for a time by leading by
seven ;lengths, and ft appeared as If
she .would last the full route. At this
point Dr. Stephens set sail as pace
maker and by saving ground got up to
her in the stretch. The. two then raced
along to the paddock gate, where the
doctor dTew away, winning rather,
handily. The track, was" still Blow.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The' Potato market was overstocked with
river Burbanks. as fresh receipts were heavy
and most of Thursday's belated arrivals were
still on band. Trade waa quiet, as buyers were
operating cautiously in expectation of a drop
in 1 prices. Onions were in increased supply
and easier, whlla Sweet Potatoes were firm
at the recently advanced quotation.
The market for miscellaneous vegetables was
heavily eupplted and weak, with lower prices
ruling for most descriptions. Tomatoes were a
glut- and sales at the top quotation were rare.
30c per box being about the top for the gen
eral market.

CHICAGO. Sept. CO.â At the opening, senti
ment In the wheat pit was rather bearish. The
! cause of the easier selling was heavier ship- I
ments from Argentina, liberal receipts Jn the
Northwest and weakness In foreign grain ciar
j keta. Initial quotations on December were a !
.shade higher to l ,4Â®V4c lower, at $1 Xl% to j
, IX 11%. May was higher to Vic lower, at
$1 12fc,Â©l 12%. After touching $i 12, Decem- ;
ber steadily aeclined to $1 lift, while May
sold off to SI ll?i. The mam feature of
I trading was % series of operations by a leaJir
of the bull crowd. The belief was quite geh
: eral that, although this operator was an open
seller, his purchases through brokers â¢ more i
thtn offset the sales. â The pit crowd was in
1 Suenced by reports of th-s alleged purchases.
ThÂ« result was a rally in prlc-ts. A report
by a St. Louis trade journal, construed as
bullish, increased' the strength. According -to
the St. Louis yaper. many complaints have
t>?en received regarding delayed plowing and
seeding In the Southwest. Under a faiiÂ»""de
mimd December advanced to $1 12"ie i l VI and
M&y.ta #1 Vi%. Th* market held firm the
latter, cart cf the day. although the advance
was, not . maintained. - Final quotations on - De
cember were fct Â£1 12%. May closed at $1 13%
fel 13V4. i
An easier tone prevailed in the' corn market
all day; December closed unchanged, at 50Â»ic.
Oats were bearish; December closed h^c
higher at SOfec.
Provisions were firm. Pork closed 5c higher.
Lard was up 2V.Â£5c and ribs 2^c higher.

Amey E.' Grace objects to" an order of

of divorce from her. husband .after he
had been dead three weeks, especially
as neither" she nor the attorney who
represented- the husband In the original
divorce" proceedings requested or con
sented tnat 'the order be made. Mrs.
Grace got -an .interlocutory decree.' of
divorce from Joseph H. Grace, a dray
man, on May 20, 1903, but by an inad
vertence the decree was never entered.
On September .12 last, three weeks after
Grace's death, Leon- Samuels, repre
senting Grace's sister and mother, had
a decree of absolute divorce entered
nu'nc pro tune as of May 27,. 1903. Mrs.
Grace seeks to have it set aside in
order that she* may be considered as
Grace's widow in the settlement of his
estate. Judge Hebbard yesterday took
her motion under consideration.
Arthur L. Piper, . secretary of the
Plper-Aden-GoOdall Company, testified
yesterday that he has no money, no
property and only $S0 a month salary,
and Is, therefore, unable to pay the
$625 due to his wife as alimony. Judge
Sloss gave him a week â¢ to see if he
could better his finances.
Judge : Hebbard yesterday annulled
the marriage of Mayme E. Fissette and
John Pederson, which took place at San
Jose, March 17, 1902. At that time
Pederson was not divorced: from his
wife Otelia,. whom he married in Hono

A conference was held yesterday by
Commissioner ' Schnitz of the Public
Works Board, Tirey LÂ». Ford, attorney
for the United Railroads, and Mayor
Schmitz in the Mayor's office relative
to the removal of the curve at Post
and Kearny streets by the board
named and the maintenanct of track
curves at other points in alleged viola
tion of a city ordinance. '". -
Replying to Ford's explanation that
the spur* track was originally laid and
long used under a franchise granted In
1879,- Commissioner Schmitz called at
tention to the ordinance prohibiting, the
construction of a . spur track within
eleven feet of the curb, whereas In
this case the curve was only six feet
away from the sidewalk. Ford con-,
tended that the ordinance was passed
one year after the grant of franchise
and, therefore, could not b6 applied.
"Even if your franchise gives you the
power to' put down the curve," said the
Commissioner, "we have the right un-
der the general police regulations to
remove it if it is proved to be a men
ace to life and limb. We deem the
public safety paramount to any rights
the railroad company may possess."
"As a way out of the difficulty," said

BUILDING STILL BRISK.â The Bureau of

permits for alterations, costing: $107,315. mak
ing a total of $1,539,847, as against $1,349,680

$1S65 30.
along Lyon street and across Pacific
avenue in the direction of the Presidio.
She describes the man as about 5 feet
7 inches tall, medium build, light hair,
reddish mustache, 25 to 30 years of
age and wore a dark coat and vest,
light striped trousers and black derby
hat. Detective Silvey is working on
the case.
With Miss Burbank the game of love
seems to have been a little more seri
ous contest. Da Silva appears to have
held the winning hand. What" MlssÂ»
Burbank knows will be of value to the
secret service men. ' ; If she can be in
duced to believe that all has not been
exactly fair in Da Silva's professed
love for her, she may tell everything.
An important bit of news that trav
eled the corridors . yesterday was that
Miss Burbank is supposed to have in
formation that will make It unneces
sary for the Government officials to go
to much trouble in looking up' evidence
in the Far East 'to convict their-pris
oner. ' - ' ';;â¢â¢'â¢:Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢" "' '-'
Upon a woman's whims and ca
prices rest important developments in
the case. The query is, will she remain
true to the man who once said, he wor
shiped her, or will she say "Re/enge
is sweet," and tell all she knows when
called upon to testify?
There is a mild current of comment
about the Federal building that tends
toward the discussion of the communi
cations and whispers of the letters that
were written to and by Da Sllya when
he was in Shanghai and Canton. Let
ters subsequently received by Da Silva
in San Francisco breathe of love, and
are said to show that the man was try
ing to gain information from Miss Bur
bank. He did not succeed in finding
out much of value, but it would be im
portant to show that he endeavored to
become possessed of official secrets. .
To return to. the Da Silva game of
hearts, there is one of his conquests
who has certainly refused to be hyp
notized. Furthermore, she is not cer
tain that his musical exploits are born
of the sort of harmony that- drives dull
care away and invokes a spirit of
adoration. During the execution of the
"Voice of Love," she says, cupid did
not come from behind the score and
fill a feminine heart with love-tipped
arrows from Â¦which had been extracted
no modicum of sting. This particular
young lady in question is Miss Carmen
Navarrete, who resides at 928 Broad
way, .where she makes light of reports
of her deep affection -for Da Silva and
looks upon Irim and the world in gen
eral as a great joke.
"I repeat that I once liked Da Silva,
but if he is in love with . another
woman, that settles it with me. Life
is too short to both.er much over men
anyway," she said. by way of assur
ance that Svengali had not glared into
her big brown eyes. *Tm all for my
self when it comes to love matches.
Da Silva is out of my life and 1 am not
worrying." . . .
The inroads on Da Silva's affections
said to have been made by Miss Bur
bank do not worry Miss Carmen in the
least. She says that Da Silva loves*
music and so does she, but that he Is
not in it -with a real nice electric piano
v/hen 'it comes to , ragtime. â¢ Guitars,
too, have their place, but not when its
foggy at North Beach. Love is only a
passing whim and that fades like the
colors on a Fourth- of July flag when
it, like momentary affection, is under
the weather.
Miss Carmen may have been one of
the young ladles that Da Silva had on
his visiting list, but one thing is cer~
tain, she knows little if anything about
the man's business relations with the
Government. So to the wings with this
dainty young girl who has played a
specialty In the half-breed interpre
ter's drama of hearts and passports. }
A GAME OF LOVE. <
THOSE MYSTERIOUS LETTERS:
No more sweethearts of H. I* Eca da
Silva have been discovered, but there
are . still rumors of others. ' The' tell
tale correspondence now In the ' hands
of the Government secret service men
refers here and there to two mysterious
women, but they wiH have no bearing
on the plans 'of the prosecution. The
case for the United States is almost
ready to present, .and Miss Agliiita
Burbank is the only woman who will
be a conspicuous figure in future de
velopment^.
Miss Burbank is a quiet, unassuming
young lady, and is not thought to be in
any way accountable for ,Da Silva' a
shortcomings, yet she will undoubtedly
be an important witness In Identifying
the letters that passed between her and
the ex-Interpreter. These epistles ; are
said to throw considerable light upon
the methods adopted by Da Sllvn to
secure inside information ' through the
unsuspecting stenographer.
Hypnotism is the fanciful side of the
Da. Silva stories. The employes of the
Chinese bureau do not think that the
strange . man who dotes on â¢ femininity
could hypnotize anything more sus
ceptible than a simple-minded Chinese
who desires to cross the border into
the United States, and knows that it
costs money to do it.
There are several batches of the Da
Silva-Burbank letters which, It Is
thought, will assist In completing the
chain of evidence against the accused
man. The prosecution will not make
these letters public until it finds a
proper place for them in the testimony.
In the mantime Miss Burbank has been
instructed to have nothing to say re
garding the case'. She talks to Inter
viewers of superficial things only.
