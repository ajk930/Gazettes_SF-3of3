TAINTED MONEY FIGHT
LOST BY DR. GLADDEN.
Ministers Desire to
Put End to the
Discussion.
NO BOYCOTT
ON DONORS
Brilliant Speech Is
Made Against
the Evil.
SEATTLE, Sept. 15.â Ey a vote of 46 to
19 the American Board of Commissioners
Xor Foreign Missfons to-day went on rec
ord as being opposed to a further dlscus
eion cf "tainted money" in any of its
phases. The vote was not takes, how
ever, until the question had been threshed
cut in all its phases and the leading Con
eregationalisis of America had voiced
their sentiments on the subject. Dr.
"Washington Gladden, the leader of the
minority, precipitated the discussion by
the introduction of a resolution to the
effect that the officers of the board should
reither invite nor solicit donations to its
funds from persons whose gains are gen
erally believed to have been made by
methods "morally Indefensiule or socially
injurious."
David Fales of Illinois immediately of
fered a sub-resolution calculated to up
hold the prudential committee in its atti
tude on the subject of such gifts, and
both were referred to a special commit
tee compose i of Dr. Gladden, the author
cf the original resolution; Mr. Fales. who
introduced the subject; Rev.. George C.
Adams, Rev. Philip S. aioxom. Rev. John
R. Tburstpn, IV. W. Mills and Guliford

TO CO.VriXUE THE FIGHT.
This committee's report was made a
tpeeial order of business at the afternoon
tcEsion. Two reports were submitted, one
from the majority, signed by five mem
bers, and the other a minority, report,
containing the signatures of Dr. Gladden
and Dr. Moxom. two of the original pro
testants.
Immediately after tb* reading of the re
ports T>r. Gladden moved the. adoption of
the minority report, and speaking to thÂ«
motion he reviewed the question, "Shall
iU Â«ouÂ«n faho be .Â»otieht for Christian
purposes?" from its Inception, concluding
with an eloquent appeal that the church
divorce itself for all time frdm this source
of contribution- Dr. Gladdens final words
\u25a0were significant of the course which it Is
his purpose to pursue In the future, not
withstanding the overwhelming vote by
â¢which the minority report was virtually
lost. v. *\u0084:,.â¢ â¢
"Some cf you have been kind enough
to assure mÂ»" that I am in a very insig
nificant ralnorits'." he said. "That may
be; I leave it to be decided by you. It
will cot be the first time that I have
been in a very small minority, even on
. this board; but I have Been such small
"minorities in a very few years grow to
overwhelming majorities. The same ap
peal of truth to time* la one on which I
have learned to rest with . hope, and . I
therefore commit with confidence what I
hav e taid to you and to the people of
the Congregational churches and to the
kindly Judgment of all honorable men."
DH. GLAJODEX APPLACDEO.
Throughout Dr. Gladden* speech and
following his rejoinders to the volley of
pertinent questions which were *hot at
fcim from all parts cf the auditorium It
vrze apparent that his attitude had made
a lasting impression upon his auditors
and at times the applause was both spon
tar.ifius and unrestrained.
After the vote was taken that finally
disposed of the matter, and even while
the ten who voted against tne motion' to
table the resolutions were standing an
plause broke oat. and Dr. Gladden!' who
left the platform at the close of th a de
bate, was overwhelmed with congratula
tions on his addres. and the Ix^on
taken by him. He held an Informal r.
ceptlon la one of thÂ© commit*** rooms
and for a few minutes the routine of the
eftercoca session wa* Interrupted.
In moving the adoption of the minority
report, committing the board against th
acceptanee of euch gifU as that recently
subscribed by John D. Rockefeller n r
Gladden said In part: '
PRINCIPLES OF BOAJID.
"The principle for. which this board waj
organized is much more than a corpora
tion to carry on missionary work and to
receive gifts for that purpose. In the
words of President Tucker: 'The board
I* not primarily a depository for the re
ception of unsolicited gifts, nor even an
agent or trustee for their disbursement. 1
Primarily the board, as it exists to-day
is a powerful organization for the
solicitation and direction of funds toward
missionary ends. Its work In these re
gards Is as positive and aggressive as
Us work in the field. Principles one and
two virtually ignore .the whole matter
of solicitation In which present Issues for
the most part lie.. .
"It is this function which we mus-t'keep
clearly before us In the. entire discussion
It Is what has been done in the exercise
of this function and nothing else that has
provoked all this controversy. Yet the
entire argument of the prudential com
mittee,, as it has been presented to the
public, has Ignored this;. fundamental is
sue. I think that a great deal of .moral
confusion has been caused by this* eva- '
eion and. l hope that we shall be able to
here get the main question fairly before
us.- \u25a0 ,â¢\u25a0
"It may be granted that gifts which
come from unknown sources, uninvited
gifts, like those , which are dropped upon
the contribution plate,. may be taken with
out questioning. To learn the source of
all such gifts â¢ would be \ impossible", " and
we are not advocating absurdities. Offer
ings that are made without ostentation,
before which no trumpets are blown',
which expect no recognition, may be free
ly received, and- no "possible harm can.be
done.' .
"But when the : fgiver comes" jwith his
rift and a^ks us to accept it publicly, and
formally at his hands the question is very
different. rasSlÃflÃÃM

Severe Fails to We^||etf|he Story
: of the Legislative' Bbodle DeaJL. I
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 15.â The de
fense of <?x-Sepator E."J. Emmons, on
trial before Judge E. C: Hart for brib
ery, is beginning to unfold. Develop
ments to-day make It certain that
Grove L. Johnson, rhicf counsel for
the accused; 's prepared to maintain
that not only can Clarence Grange,
manager Of the Phoenix Building- and
Loan- Association, and William Corbin
and &avin McN'ab, manager and coun
gel respectively, of . - the Continental
Building and Loan Association, be con
sidered accessories to -the crime, for
which Emmons Is in the toils, but he
will ;con.trnd that they are, in fact, the
arch^conspira tors in a spheme that was
concocted to save their Institutions
from crumbling beneath the weight of
condemnatory revelations. Without
discussing the merits- of this conten
tion or speculating as to Its possible ef
fect on the minds of the Jurors, the
opinion may be hazarded that It will
fan the flames of strife until a legal
conflagration hardly excelled in the
history of the State will rage.
That this will be the line of ihe de
* fense was made apparent when Grange
testified to-day that Jordan called upon
him An San Francisco and told him that
h 1 was popping- in Sacramento; that
the Senate Committee on Commissions
and Retrenchment had decided to In
vestigate all get-rich-quick [ concerns
Â«nd buildinff and loan associations, but
that'a majority of the committee was
open for ' business and., that Emmons
was after the Continental, hoping to
secure enough evidence to warrant the
arrest of Gavin McXab and Dr. Wash
ington Dodge for compounding 1 , a fel
ony. Which felony, he did not say.
Johnson will maintain' that .Grang-e,
McXabV Dddgre and Corbin. frightened
by the possibility that Emmons might
secure tfa-e evidence for which he was
seeking, .conspired to discredlt'the com
mittee and succeeded, "as/the r public
knows only too well. ..'-,_
WRIGHT . AGAIX ARRESTED.
The rearrest.of Ell Wright, who Is
'to -be placed on trial after^ the case
of Emmons is disposed of, also added
Interest to the day's proceedings.- . A
telegtam was received by. Sheriff Reese
from San Jose, signed jointly by E. V.
Hunt and W. M. Boggs, requesting that
Wright be again taken \u25a0 Into custody
and the sureties named released from
ti i s b ond." â¢ â¢ r\u25a0\u25a0,-'r \u25a0\u25a0,- '
Sheriff Reese refused to make the ar
rest before receiving a certified copy of
the bond. Late this afternoon the doc
ument arrived and Wright was again
tairer! into custody.
Slnee Emmons' trial opened Wright
has been in constant attendance, "but
this aid not still the nefves" of ' his'
bondsmen, who became apprehensive"
that he might at any/ moment decide
up&n flight at ."their expense. Wright
pasted the night In jail, his attorneys^
failing to secure men who would guar
antee with their gold that he would
appear when called to the bar to battle
for vindication.' ' : : "
When court reconvened this inorning
Bunkers was asked If he "had had any
* conversation with the District Attor
ney or any one connectd with "the prose
cution sineeÂ«court adjourned the evening
btfore. He denied that he had and the
â¢ cross examination was resumed. Asked
about the meeting with French In San
Francisco, at which ex- Assemblyman
Gleeson was present, the witness said
that Gleeson only came to the door of
Bunkers' restaurant, where the conversa
tion was held. He was confident that
Gleeson did not enter the store, nor. did he
take part In the conversation between the
witness and French.
JOH.VSOX SARCASTIC.
Johnson next took up the question of
Bankers* : service In the navy, dropping
it abrubtly after ascertaining that at his
trial Bunkers made no mention of ever
having been in the service of the Gov
ernment,
His testimony, given at his trial, was
then read by Johnson and the witness
was a-ked if it..' was true or false. Bunk
ers . testified' without hesitation that the
ttate/nents"made by him .in. his own de
fense, wltlj the exception of; one, were
false throughout- and constituted deliber
ate perjurj-.
When Bunkers testified that one state
ment made by himâ that he had signed
Stfbpenas in blankâ was really true,
Johnson swung his right arm In a circle
and said: "Hurrah!" A general laugh
followed.
\u25a0Oh the opening of the afternoon ses
sion Bunkers took advantage of an op
portunity to "correct his statement that
the first meeting held by the four bood
ling members of the Committee on Com
missions and Retrenchment was on Thurs
day. January VL He said the meeting
was in fact on January "19, and at' that
meeting plans' were made to bleed the
gret -rich-quick concerns and building and
loan associations.
MOXEY PAID TO EMMOXS.
Bunkers was then again asked as. to
the payment of boodle money to Em
xnoxis; He positively reiterated*, his â¢ state
ment that just before Emmons was paid,
Pmmons, Jordan and himself met at the
corner of Eighth and-K streets.
"Jordan told me," said Bunkers, "that
he had the money; that he would soon
pay Emmons and-would then payme,- but
as we demanded to see the man before
whom the money was to be paid,' Emmons
said he would walk through Hanlon's
ealoon. where the man was seated, and
look him over. This Emmons did, and
coon came out. He and Jordan walked
across the street. Jordan came \u25a0 back
lnj a moment and told me*he had paid
Emmons. We then walked \u25a0 around the
corner, behind a sandwich wagon, and
Jordan dropped my share of the money
into my pocket."
Bunkers then told of the Investigation
of ; the Bardwell-Ford' Syndicate, the" in
vestigation taking three hours and a
hajf. The company -had witnesses; they
were heard and the matter was continued
until a later date," when the Investiga
tion wu completed.
Later a building and loan association
of- which Gunzendorfer. Is manager was
partly investigated and then William Cor
bin of the Continental Building- and Loan
Association was subpenaed to "appear
Thursday. Â«ppear
' "DjTd > man. named Pollthorpe, an. ac
countant* appear at that â¢Uinerv asked
Johnson.'." . \ *-- : '.. ' -â¢ '* *
Hesia;,tt was our intention to go into
the" Investigation of the Continental thor
oughly.. We had been prompted to do that
by "â¢ publications ' in' a" newspaper." '
".Was "that In good faith T'.. "\
**lftToD*;way."yes, and in'anotber, no.""
"Yptf ihoughtit should be- Investigated,

should oe protected?" . . . ';, \~ r . . . â¢; .'.
"T" T "I '.thought ':. bo,"^ ' said Johnson. â¢ ! -'' '-
"Why.'didybuithink soT said Seymour,
"Goodness knows, I've lost enough
money in building "and loan tor make ; me
think so," answered Johnson warmly.
TELLS OF THE EXPOSURE.
"Corbin did not come, did he?" contin
ued Johnson.
"He did not and the-matter was report
ed to the Senate and Corbin was cited
for contempt*. Corbin appeared' and then
camo the exposure."
"You quit then?" ' .\u25a0
'Tes, wfe thought It was time to quit."
"You left the poor people of your dis
trict without relief from the Continen
tal?" - .
An objection to this question was sus
tained. " : ,
"Who asked you to subpena the Conti
nental?"
"Mr. French."
â¢ "Did a man named Myrtle ask you to
examine the Continental?"
"He did not." .. : -V
"Did he ask you to subpena Mr. Poli
thorpeT'
This question was not answered, the
turning on of the ventilating fans causing
a diversion" and the question- was not
again asked. \u25a0
Bunkers was again led over the ground
following the exposure. He told of the
meeting at which he, Emmons, Wright and
Jordan . were present and at that time
Jordan said he had a grood friend, Jimmy
Copeland, that could be relied upon to
take the marked bills to Billy Hanlon's
saloon and put them in the safe.
PROMISE FOR CONFESSION.
Johnson announced that thÂ£ cross-exam
ination was closed and Seymour took up
the redirect examination. - In answer to
questions of the District Attorney Bunk
ere said: -
"I was^ not promised immunity â¢by the
District Attorney should I commit per
jury at this trial; he only promised in
return for my confession not to prosecute
me for perjury I committed at my own
trial.'.: â¢
Bunkers was again turned over to Jobn-
Bon . for recross-examinatlon. Johnson
wanted nothing more from the- witness,
but turning quickly to him he said:
"It 1 would be supererogation on my
part to interrogate you further on the
actualities and the contended theories In
this case, would it not?" "
Johnson's eyeÃ twinkled 'as he watched
Bunkers glance ; in. startled ' amazement
from one. to the other in the courtroom.
Noting ' Bunkers' confusion, the court sus
tained an objection to the question, and
the prisoner was returned to his celL .
- GRANGE TAKES STAND. : . \u25a0
Clarence Grange, manager of the Phoe
nix Building and Loan Association, fol
lowed Bunkers on the stand. Grange testi
fied that -ho S had j known- Joseph - Jordan
for two and a. half years. He saw Jordan
on Saturday, January 21, at his residence
on Broadway,' San Francisco.:-" . â¢ :
A question as to ...what 'Jordan .-.said:, to
the witness on the occasion of., that meet-
Ing was vigorously objected to by Grove
L. Johnson ' for the defense. - He main
tained that Bunkers had in no .way I con
nected Jordan asfan agent of the defend
ant or any ' of the alleged conspirators,
nor was Jordan In any way authorized to
act as go-between. .All that was told
Bunkers by the other defendants was to
"keep Jordan In sight," and in no way
could this be held, Johnson argued, to be
an authorization' -that would be binding
upon the defendant.
"Did" the mere statement, 'Keep Jordan
in sight,' authorize Jordan to hoist the
black flag of piracy and turn his guns on
the coffers of the corporations -of the
State?" asked Johnson. "We grant that
this is a suspicious statement, but no man
can be held liable upon mere suspicion.
The liberty of this man is at stake In this
trial, and can it be' seriously "contended
that the mere statement to Bunkers,
â¢Keep Jordan In sight,' establishes the
conspiracy, upon which this case hangs?
We contend that it does not"
PLAN FOR' "BLACKMAIL.
District Attorney Seymour contended
that Bunkers' testimony was sufficient, to
establish the conspiracy for â¢ the purpose
of introducing declarations of co-con
spirators. He admitted that it was not
sufficient to warrant the\convictton . of
the accused, but supplied. a basis for the
introduction of any declarations Jordan
may have made In connection with the
plot to bleed corporations:
Judge Hart held with Seymour, ruling
that a prima facie case ' as ' to ' the con
spiracy haa been established. Grange ;thÂ£n
continued: ' . ./
"Jordan called on me and said that
he was hoping, that an Investigation
was 'to T>e made of the *Blg Four/ the
four bis companies of San Francisco;
that the Committee ~ on - Commissions
and Retrenchment would meet* Tues
day and start; an investigation. I told
him so far as any Investigation of the
Phoenix was concerned I had nothing:
to fear. He . said > the committee pro
posed to make all kinds of trouble,' but
that the committee was open for.Jjusi
ness. He wanted to know If I would
pay for immunity. I told him the
other managers; must-flrsf be oonsulted
and tnat - 1 , must * first have â¢ a definite
proposition. .â¢ . . ,
"He said be .would see Bunkers and
French" and ] would' call' the next .day.
He told me he had talked with Bunkers
and ' It was .arranged that ; he . should
come to see me. He further told ; me
he was to see; Bunkers and:, French

FOR FORTUNE
Contends for a Large Sum
Entrusted by Her' to the
Late Edwin S. FretwelL
JUDGE INCREASES BOND
Searching Inquiry Is Made
as to Value of the Estate
Left by Bank President
A case of treat Interest is before
Judge Lennon of the Superior Court,
Marin County, in which Lotta. the fa
mous actress, is endeavoring to estab
lish her rights to a large sum of money
entrusted by her years ago to Edwin iv
Fretwell. now deceased, and formerly
president of tLÂ« American Bank and
Trust Company.
The amount involved reaches to
about iSO.OOO Â»Jid yesterday morning 1
tae court ordered the administratrix of
Krettreil's estate. Miss Sophia C. L.ivesey,
to file an amended account and ordered
her bond increased from $10,000 to
$100,000, because it developed that there
w^.B more property in the estate than
\u25a0was represented when the first bond
was Sled.
In the course of the proceedings
Judge Lennon asked Attorney Ed^ar
Wilson, who an-eared for the adminis
tratrix, how it was that mention " was
njot made of the full value of the es
tate at the first time the bond was ti seed.
answered that ' they subse
quently discovered the property of the
estate. This statement was made by
the witness notwithstanding: that the
principal asset of the estate was 2563
t hares of the Western Pacific .Land
Company, which stood in Fretwell's
came, and of which company Wilson
was a director and the administratrix
the secretary.
The account filed in court shows that
528.000 had been collected by the ad
ministratrix as dividends or this stock.
There was also a controversy over
several hundred shares oX the stock of
the Western Pacific Land Company and
some $7000 in money, which, it was
claimed on behalf of Lotta, was not
properly accounted for as assets of 'the
FretweJl estate. * â
Some time before his death Fretwell
gave Lotta a will he had executed, tell
ing: her that she was protected, as it
pave tier all his property. However, he
XC.ride a later will, giving all of his
â¢ ; r aperty to his wife. This later will is
mow in course of probate.
John I'lournoy appeared as attorney
for Lotta. The further hearing- was
continued for two weeks. .

The Immediate undoing of Stephen
was caused, not through his connec

was published exclusively In yesterday

Emergency Hospital Training School.

The new establishment, which has
been a farce, will end its career at
once. On this- condition and on the
understanding; that he be " ; allowed; full
power to Improve the mismanaged-hos
pital serlice did Dr. Millar accept; the po
sition declared. vacant, by Mayor Schmltz.
The end that came to Dr. J. L Stephen
has been long predicted. ; -From the be
ginning of his official career he has
been guilty of actions not in keeping
with his position. From the first
Mayor Schmitz objected to the appoint

Stephen, . through some peculiar : trait,
seemed to regard his position >s> se

the service, brazenly defied all the powers
that be and made life miserable f or : his
assistants..
Thursday morning complaint was
registered with Mayor Schmitz regard-"

man a' member of the hospital 'training
school. The plea was madeA that' the
woman's \u25a0 actions were a slur upon ; the
names of all of the women, employed
as nurses Vln the service. "Mayor
Schmltz's anger knew no" bounds. ,He
Immediately donned: his hat \ and coat

immediate action. ; Stories that-: had
long been regarded fas -outbursts ~\ of

Schmitz's mind 'was firm. Stephen
must go.
- Yesterday/ morning . It - became , known
tljat a'change was to take place.. The
Mayor was desirous of withholding the_
information until i to-day. Secrecy, was"
in vain. "Eyes that had been -turned, to 'the

"Mr. Chairman. I act as I think right.
I do not think whether I am acting for
the New York Life or J. P. Morgan &
Co. X follow ray conscience and do what I
think Is right."
The Senator was unmoved, and asked:
"But where did your, loyalty to. one or
the other end?" - â¢
Assemblyman Rogers broke In and said:
"The Senator Is thinking of the Scrip
tures, 'a man cannot serve two masters.'
Mr. Perkins replied: -. .
"My loyalty lies where ray duty is."
"I want to say." continued Mr. Perkins,
. "right here that since I have been with
J. P. Morgan & Co., during these last
fcur years, that company has marketed
more securities than the New York Life,
the Equitable and the Mutual hay .ac
cumulated in the last sixty years. Compe
tition no longer Is the life of trade: it
Is co-operation." â¢, i v V|;
: < GOODS IX VAULTS.
"Now, about the $800,000 sale and pur
chase," said Hughes, breaking In oh Per
kins.'"You had the goods in your vaults
"And then you got rid of them for what
purpose?"
; "Because it was a good business invest
ment."
"In other syndicate transactions you
furnished the money?"
.:"Wedid." - r *\i'*i^'~*SU
"Who conducted the joint accounts on
, behalf of the New York Life?"
"I do^-all of them."
, "In regard to the Boston bondsâ you
bought them to sell at a profit and to di
vide It up. with the partners In the syndi
cate?" . .
S "Not at all. We bought them as a good
in\-estment. We go into these affairs to
get possession of the bonds, and we may
hold them for years before sale. I am
very proud of this joint account. I orig
inated it. I conduct it. It is our aim to
get goods at cost prices."
I "Ib the loss divided In these joint ac
counts?" .
"Yes; but we reserve the right to with
draw our securities. The other man has
no right to our share pf the profits."
As to the joint accounts Perkins said:
"When we desire a certain security 'we
go to a firm. and^ tell^them if they will
take half of a quantity of bonds we will
take the other half. These people some
times say. 'We would like to do this, but
it is inconvenient at this time; we have
not the money.* As we are looking to loan
money we say. *If you will be responsible
for your ' chare we will loan you the
money and withdraw our bonds and carry
the rest at bond interest on joint ac
count.' " ,
Perkins explained the method of the
New York Life In : dealing * with others
along this line, and was then questioned
about a purchase on November 30, 1304, of
tLOOO.OOO par value Erie convertible fours
at 94. for- which the New York Life paid
tC-40,000 to W. S. Fanshaw &.Co. He was
asked If Panshaw & Co. purchased these*
of J. P. Morgan & Co., and he replied
that they may have bought them of J. P.
Morgan & Co. He would find out.
Perkins was asked as to \u25a0 a number of
temporary loans that appeared on the
books, but he would not testify without
the details and data, which he will fur
1 ni sh at a later session. -
Adjournment was taken to-day at 4

j tnittee to return to their homes. There

mand Universal Suffrage
BUDAPEST, Hungary, Sept .. 15.â Since
this morning dense masses "of workmen
have been marching to the lower "house .]
of the Diet for the purpose, of . mejiingj
a demonstration in favor of universal suf-/!
fragre. Crowds composed' of other "classes*
also gathered j and strong 3 cordons of i po-*
lice were posted near the .building, Herr
Julius Justh.J president', of, the, house, re
selved the deputations. >. who presented
petitions setting 1 forth the demands of,the
people. In. reply, Herr Justh said; his po
sition .as Â©resident \u25a0 of the house pre
vented his expressing ah' opinion," but > he"
begged the people - to <â¢'â¢ await 'quietly the
decision of Parliament. . . . '
Work t is at- a. standstill, in'' all of the
factories, as the workers are taking; part
lin tho demonstration; No disturbances
1 had occurred up to the time this dis
' patch was filed.
On the reopening of the -^Diet to-day
Baron Fejervary' formally announced . the
resignation of the Cabinet' and the pro
rogation .of . Parliament until October .10,
to enable the ; coalition parties to submit
a programme to the' King-Emperor Fran
cis Joseph. v
There was marked tension on all sides
when Baron Fejervary rose to address
the legislators. The resignation of the
Cabinet, he declared, was necessitated by
an overwhelming force of circumstances
which prevented the Government from
carrying out the* mission \u25a0 with which it
â¢had been entrusted. '
"His Majesty ,',' proceeded 'the Minister,
"has authorized roe to say jthat he wishes
to form a government, from the ranks
of the . majority after an agreement on
*an acceptable programme. In order ; to
enable the coalition parties â¢to submit
proposals to his Majesty, the House 'is
prorogued until October 10."
-The announcement was greeted by the
members of the Left party with 'shouts
of "the same old game." .. , .'.
Francis -Kossuth, tho leader, of the
United Opposition, vigorously, protested
against the prorogation of Parliament as*
being unconstitutional. A motion by. Kos
suth to \u25a0 this sense was adopted and the
House adjournedVamid great excitement.
HIS CREDULITY

CHIC^-viO, Sept." 15.â Dr. Alfred L. Cole,
a physician who. retired^ frQm practice
several "years ago and is Hying, with .his
famiiy at the Auditorium Annex/ has sued
"Rev.". Mabel LI" Jackman, the head of, a
spiritualistic cult, <to recover. |3000 he. says
he lost through her instrumentality.
." The writ was "given to a deputy sheriff
for service, but the-" officer .-has ..reported
that "the Shepherdess! of. Paradise" went
to Australia a- few weeks ago, ostensibly
to found a new church. Service has "not
yet been obtained.. The" story told in con
nection" with the suit is a remarkable ex
hibition of the 'credulity .of the . people
wijom "Rev." Mrs. Jackman gathered
around her m the various places: in which
she has operated in Chicago. "Dr.- Cole is
said to have lost nearly $7500 In an 'al
leged "wire" tapping", swindle," having | put
up . the money, he alleges, on the advice
of Mrs. Jackman, who claimed to receive
"tips" from the spirits, i but \wheh ,nb
profits came In he slowly realized that he
had been duped and that the spirits were

Say Commercial' Classes in
â¢'.I -This Country Will Not
v /Follow Up Advantages
V BERLIN, /Sept." 15.â The action' of Presi
dents! Roosevelt In sending Judge William
L;^enfleld, solicitor of the State Depart
ment; to- investigate the trade relations
between the countries - of . South America
and those of Europe, with 1 the view of
improving 'commerce ,; with the" countries
lying i to ' the south of the United States,
has attracted considerable attention "here.
vTbe, central bureau for the. preparation
of commercial treaties, a private organi
zation, representing the" views of a Jargo
section' of ' German '/: manufacturers. ; de
dlares'the" mission of Judge Penfleld Is an
indication that the authorities at Wash
ington ; mean to go'forward "full* steam
ahead" *to \u25a0 capture the South American
markets/ "-^M|BBsB . .
Nevertheless, It Is pointed out by th*
bureau the action of the^American Gov
ernment* fails to find an adeauate echo in
the "American business world, and it'adds
that, there; are many indications that thÂ«
commercial classes -will not avail them
selves of the advantages opened to them
through governmental ; action. ,
"The: bureau calls attention to the reci
procity treaty .between Cuba and . ttw
United States, which,* although offering a
heavyTdiscrimlnatlon In favor "of 'Ameri
can "imports, has not damaged the ; trade
in ' German and other _ European goods , to
the extent apprehended, but that, 7 on thÂ»
contrary. ! Imports "_\u25a0 from Germany arÂ«
actually- increasing In spite of the treaty.
According to the bureau thU proves that
competition from the. United States need
not be feared In South America. :

GOULD PAINED
BY I. RAMSAY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. lo.â Representative
Wabash Railroad interests to-day refused
to take a serious view 'of the call for
proxies issued,, to stockholders by Joseph
Ramsey Jr., president of the system.
They said. George J. Gould and his as
sociates had been < surprised j and rather
pained â¢ byi^the notice made public to
day by " Mr. Ramsey and that they con
sidered the latter had compromised ' his
future as a railroad man by, his action.
Other Wabash interests adopted a similar
attitude. They, asserted they did not be
lieve a group of financiers was . behind
the president of the Wabash. ,
In Wall Btreet a variety of opinions
prevailed regarding the Wabash situa
tion. .Prominent interests. identified with
the Pennsylvania Railroad characterised
as absurd any theory that the Penn
sylvania was a secret power behind Ram
sey in disputing the control of the Wa
bash with Gould. It is admitted the
Pennsylvania Railroad took over a little
Kanawaha property from .Ramsey and
his associates to thwart the Wabash ex
tension toward the Atlantic seaboard and
also that the great railway system bit
terly opposed Gould in his plans to, enter.
Pittsburgh This opposition, / however, it
is said, was purely of a local nature,
in. other words a fight by a road against
what It regarded as an encroachment on
its territory. ;
Another theory had it that Rockefeller
was behind Ramsey. One fact dominated
the situation to-day. That was that the
rival interests * had - a cam
paign of competitive ' purchases of Gould
securities with the idea of obtaining con
trol. Advances were <. maCe In Wabash
and Missouri Pacific.
RAMSAY WAXTS CONTROL.
Dralea That He !\u25a0 Allied With Van-

Ship W. F, Bab
cock Comes at
Last to Port!
MAKES VERY
LONG VOYAGE
Members of Crew
Suffer From In
tense Cold.
SEVERAL ARE
FROST BITTEN
The American clipper. ship W. F. Bab
cock, which has been blowing about off
this port for several days, managed to
come Into the harbor , yesterday morning,
IS4 flays from New York. The Babcock is
not a particularly speedy vessel, but this
is a long passage even for her. The ship
was not altogether responsible . for her
tardiness, however. During the early part
cf the voyage Captain" Moxsen's health
broke down and so serious did his condi
tion become that a course was set for |
Montevideo, the nearest place where a
doctor could bÂ« found. /
The Babcock reached Montevideo May
Â£2. Captain Moxsen was carried ashore
and the doctor ordered him into the hos
pital. On May 27, in command of the
mate, who became Captain Severn, the
Babcock resumed the voyage for this
port.
The Babcock had a terrible time of, it
rounding Cape Horn. Gale after gale was
encountered and the cold was intense.
Time and again hull. and rigging became
solidly encased in ice, and it was with
the greatest. diflJculty- that the ship was
worked. Several members of . the crew
were laid up as the result of the exposure
and some of them were severÂ«y frost-bit
ten. â¢
The Babcock brought 2100 tons of coal
Â»nd 1000 tons of calcium carbide.

(iowÂ«rful swimmer, but the Eej-ras; Sea w.is
rovel- that night and to ihe darkness was
e-V-ed a thick fog. He almost had given up
norc of being picked up vhen an arm grabl-ed
hira and he was pulled Into the dory. It Â»vas
efvtrtl days, before he tÂ«c.jÂ» f ered from the ef
fe-.ts of the exposure.
Another Overdue Reaches Port.
The British ship Marion Fr*zer, out 194 days
from Newcastle, England, for San Diego, ar
rived yesterday at thÂ« latter port. News of
her eafety reached here a few minutes after
her rate o" reinsurance had been advanced
from ?\u25a0 to 10 -per cent. Tbe Grcsmere is still
quoted at S i>er cent and the La.la Rockh at
85 per cent. The British ship Principality, out
135 days from Junin for Rotterdam, was pjaced
on the overdue list at 40 per cent. The French

SCHOOL ROOM NEEDED.
LUTHER BURBANK said, In his address at the California State
Board of Trade banquet, that the people of this country- had
now achieved the necessary variation by crossing, and that
the perfect man of the future is to be formed by the environment' in
which the child of the present is reared. For one-fourth of every
day. during three-fourths of every year the American child- finds its
environment in the schoolroom.' During that time it is removed
from parental control. The parents abdicate their place at 9 o clock
in the morning and do not resume it until 4 o'clock in the after
noon. It will be seen then that during the most important^ part' of
the actual daylight of every day the child is getting impressed by
its school environment. Its mental, moral and physical welfare is
not in parental control at all. <
The Government makes this compulsory. Government com
pels the parent to school the child. Government- forbids that, the
child shall do gainful work until well up in its teens, and then
Government follows the child to its employment and compels the
employer to give it light, air. and safe and . sanitary surroundings,
under "penalty. But in the schoolroom the Government itself takes
charge of the child from the age of 5 until the law permits it to
work at 14 or 15, and controls- it entirely for seven years of the nine
that lie between the school age and the working age. We say en
tirely, for whatever influences a child six hours every day dom
inates its mental and physical growth.,
Government is quick to take the child from its parents, eager
in compelling the employer to obey the law in the environment; he
furnishes to the child of working age, but what is Government doing
while it controls that environment during the most important and
formative stage in the seven ages of man? /
To get an answer one needs to read the reports of the health
boards of our large cities and study the pictures ; of the school
houses that Government furnishes. In New York City Govern
ment shuts children six hours per day in schoolrooms that, the di
rect sunshine never reaches, where proper ventilation is impossible
and where artificial light is used as -a -feeble and ineffectual sub
stitute for sunlight. In that city and in others Government does
not furnish enough even of such repulsive and dangerous quarters
to give all the children a chance in the classes for a full day. Mak
ing education compulsory, it fails to provide even poor 'quarters, for
all the children of citizens who must obey the law or receive its
punishment. Therefore the children get a half day in the environ
ment of the street.
The appalling seriousness of it all may appear in the fact that
more than one-third of our population lives in cities. More than
one-third of the children whose environment is to form the man of
the future, better or worse than the man of to-day, are reared in
cities, their characters formed and their future determined by the
environment given them by Government in school.
It is frequently said by school officers and by those who enforce
the truancy laws that not much can be expected of many children
in school because of the bad quality of their home surroundings.
Rather this be reversed; what can be expected- of children in the
home considering the bad quality of their school surroundings?
Here in San Francisco Government compels children to pass six
hours a day for nine months in the year in school buildings that arc
over ponds and deposits of filth that would nauseate a sewer pipe:
It seats them in rooms badly lighted and with no ventilation {at all.
It crowds them into classes too large to be beneficial, seats twice
as many in a room as it should hold, and when it buys land for a
schoolhouse neglects to leave space around it for light and air;
Government in this and every large city in the country is compelling,
the children, its future citizens, into an environment and into con-;
ditions worse than those for which Government punishes the em
ployers of children who are allowed to work.
These are hard truths, but they are truths. No one ques
tions the Tightness of Luther Burbank's statement of the impor
tance of environment, its equal importance with heredity. What
hope is there for a race one-third of w-hich is exposed to such en
vironment? Burbank says that his obsen^atio'n^proyes. that acquired;
characters and characteristics become hereditary, and that heredity
is in fact the sum of all past environments. Then=heredity and en
vironment are merged. They mean the. same thing, and Govern
ment undertaking the solemn responsibility of fixing the transmissi
ble characteristics of its people must have that responsibility forced
upon it and its proper discharge compelled, as it compels parents to
give to it their children, in the formative period of: their lives.
It was said truly at the banquet to Mr. Burbank that for twenty
years the State Board of Trade has stimulated the most valuable
and intensive of the known and visible resources of; the; State, and
has promoted the disclosure of its unknown and invisible; capacities.
That is a high function, and it may turn out that in the \u25a0 wave of
thought started by the Burbank banquet the Board of Trade : has
compelled attention to the State's greatest resource of all, the chil
dren of the people, and. their environment.
WILL THE WOOD TIE GO?
, . \u25a0 â¢ - , . . \u25a0 â¢ ;
THE friends of the forest may be gratified by the cessation of a
great drain upon timber, , through the cessation of its use as
crossties for railways. With an average of 2800 to* the mile
American roads consume 60,000,000 ties per annumJ As the yield
is two ties to the tree, 30,000,000 trees are consumed annually lf or
this purpose. The average life of a wood tie is eight' years: THe
steel tie is now coming into use. They weigh thirteen to the ton
and cost $2 apiece. But their life is twenty-five years, so that in.
the end they cost no more than a wood tie that has to be relaid
three times in . that period. To replace wood with ; steel : on American
railways would ' require 60,000,00o f tons : of steel, .without counting in
the electric, cable, elevated and' horse street roads of the country:
The use of structural iron and steel in building in place of
the wooden frame has greatly economized the timber. of N:he coun
try, jhough? this economy is unfortunately, offset by the < insatiate
wood pulp milK With steel ties on our \ railroads and the substitution
of some annual crop for paper pulp, our forests -, would stand some
chance for their lives. It is hot i yet settled that steel will ; serve
the purpose of wood for ties for lack^^of .flexibility. /The wood i tie
bends and recovers^ its lines. This.prevents the hard hammering
that shakes apart the joints of cars and increases the; wear of "wHeels.
Only use can 'determine whether steel will do. ; -The >) -Pennsylvania'
road has^alfeady put sFeel on important parts of its track, andi if >it
be approved by that road its use will . soon general' 'and {the
section gang will be - relieved Vof:^ much of the work :' heretofore .-Te-;
quired^of it. If it be, found fit; -its^use will, give a great impulse !to
the production of steel, the material for ties.'
The Iron Trade Review says that the physical and chemical re
quirements for the tie will be easier than for rails; and at the end
of their life of twenty-five years thty will have a scrap value. But
the elements of economy and. safety will decide the matter, an <i- if
approved on those points 'the steel tie" will k comej to stay; and; 3o^
000,006 oak, hemlock, red elm, catalpa and red w^ood trees" "vvill> have
their death sentence commuted. JBfcWBBBBB

MINING SYNDICATE.
LARGE DEAL IN PROSPECT
Multi-Millionaires After ;R : ch Ledges
and Will Exploit Them Jointly.
A report comes from Goldfield that a
eyndicate of capitalists headed by Charles
M. Schwab has undertaken to secure con
trol of the more Important" mines of^^ the
Goldfield district, and to merge them into
the control of one huge corporation. â¢Mul
ti-millionaires are credited at Goldfield
with the intention of taking the pick of
the district's developed properties. Schwab
and his associates now control several of
the richer mines in Tonopah. twenty-five
miles north of Goldfield, on the same
â¢tretch of mountainous desert. }
* Among the properties that are likely to
be merged, according to current report,
are the Combination. Jumbo. Florence.
r January and Atlanta mines. These . have
' iXi produced a heavy tonnage of high
grade shipping ore. The group forms the
core cf the district Possession of these
properties In one ownership would Illus
trate the modern tendency to concentra
tion of great Interests in a new field.
According to the statements of a*Gold
field correspondent the representatives of
the syndicate first approached the prin
cipal owners of the Atlanta group of
min^s with an offer for a controlling in
terest In the corporation. Since then
owners of the other properties mentioned
have been offered tempting prices for
t heir holdings. The Atlanta mines are re
ported to be Just passing from the pros
pect ?tÂ£ge to the producing stage. The
uwners of the controlling interest In he
jroperties are Henry Weber of Milwau
kee and Marvin I?h of Denver. They
Tvent into the district without money, but i
"made good" at Goldfield.
POOR MXX OWNED ALL.
Nearly every property involved In the
merger project was at one time owned by
poor men. The Taylor brothers, who lo
t ated the famous Jumbo -and now own ttre
controlling interest qf the property, were
grub-staked with J4O worth of supplies.
After locating the Jumbo. Red Top and
Florence groups, which at one time com
prised but one group of claims, Charles
Taylor returned to Tonopah without do
ing the assessment work on his locations
required by law to hold title, and prob
ably would not have done so but for Alva
Meyers, one of the original locators of the
Combination mine, who urged him to re^
kVurn and perform the work. On the trip
TJu: from Tonopah Taylor offered Meyers
tfc!s interest in the property for $40, but
Meyers was unable to raise that much
\u25a0money. Now Taylor and associates are
reported to be practically millionaires.
When Alva Meyers decided to go on a
prospecting trip, he selected the locality
that is now Goldfield as the field of his
operations, having become convinced that
a porphyry belt extended through the
country. This conviction was basc-d upon
the varying shades of light that he had
notictd from afar while stndlng" in front
of his cabin east* of Tonopah, where he
was developing a property. Another fea
ture of the general formation was the
evident tilt of Columbia and Knickerbock
er Mountains, the two most prominent
uplifts in the district.
He also was grub-staked by a syndi
cate of ten friends and came out on an
equal share preposition. Before the end
of his compa'"- with fcis backers, which
had a tenure of life of two months, he
had bonded the Combination group for
J7S.CWO besides locating some valuable
ground In the immediate vicinity. The
people who bonded the Combination paid
$TtOOO down and took the balanceâ s7o,oooâ
out of the ground in sinkins a shaft to a
depth of less than 100 feet. It is the sec
ond richest mine In all Goldfield. |Â« ;.:;
\u25a0 Of equal interest is the story of the* ear
ly discovery of the January mine and its
Fubfpquer.t history. R. I^. Johns, who
is now the president and one of the prin
cipal owners, had. not the money to pay
for the assessment work at the time he
made his locations. He gave* a fifth to
yach of three associates, who now share
dually with him. The ' January is now
cne of the big mines of the district.
Over 51.000,000 was taken out of it last
year en a single lease by "January"
Jones.
In the small area embracing the proper
ties included In the merger deal is. cen
tered the greatest acuvity In mining In
the whole district. The district in? which
are situated the gold mines that - the
Pennsylvania steel magnate Is reported
to be reaching for Is credited with a total
gold production of more than $4,000,000 in
two years.
OI'RM.NG OLD MIXES., '-.
The old Yuba copper mine, near, Hon
cut. will be reopened. The work of
pumping out the old ehaft is about to be
frin. The shaft was sunk in IS6O and
1861, but the ore was not considered val
uable enough then to pay, there -being no
railroad to haul ore or supplies. "One
thaft of. the Blue Lead mine near Bangor
has recently been pumped out and.de
velopment work will be started at once.
A tunnel 1500 feet long will be run to tap
what is' known as, the Rehfuss property.
Considerable interest attaches to the in
crease in the gold output evidenced by, the
\u2666ftimates of the director of s the mine for
ISO 4. The increase. in California gold pro
duction, amounting, to $3,000,000.* surpasses
the- total Increase for Colorado and all of
Alaska. The. total gold output for Cali
fornia in JSO4 is equal to the , grand ,, total
for Alaska,; Nevada.: Idaho. '[ Oregon and i
Arizona combined, and came - $5,- -
#EÂ«W,000 cf.tbe total of Colorado. With the
of dredging that is prob? \
able. California*, ought ,- to lead all the ;
States in ' gold production within < three >
years. | .'lv- \u25a0 '-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.-\u25a0
The Chico Enterprise , reports that I a
rich quartz ledge has been discovered in
the bottom of a tunnel about ; two and
one-half miles from the 'Cherokee \ mine:
The sum of $45,000 has been. expended; in
development work on the property. ~

DEVELOPMENT OX COAST.
The Fairbanks (Alaska) Evening News
majces the following statements concern-
Ing a matter of importance to Alaska
miners:
There are two things which this country_ls
greatly ' concerned in having- determined. One
of these ts the exact" definition, of the word
â¢"discovery." ThÂ« miner wants. to know what
that isâ what Is a discovery? when has. he
made a discovery? Judge Wlckersham has de
clared that the first ownership of a claim, thÂ«
reserving of twenty acres out of the public do
main In the name of any individual, must be
based upon an actual discovery of gold. The
driving of stakes, the recording and the pay
ment of recording fees, thts securing of re
ceipts therefor, or any other red tape, or cir
cumstance will not do it. There must be a
discovery of gold. â¢ That' decision was - hailed
with general rejoicing over the whole district.
Dlscoverv of gold meant digging in the ground,
mean ttije Â«nd of the power of attorney out
rase under which one man en one trip- could
take ur> the- public domain in twenty-acre
tracts until be wearied of writing the names;
It m*ant the release of the country to the
prospector, the nnllmberlng of . the energies of
the industrious, the reservation of the treasure
of the Â«arth to reward those who should go
down into the ground to get it. The placer and
other mines of this country were for those
who discovered them. This was the effect of
the decision at first sight. '
' What Is discovery? Immediately this ques
tion \S up for answer." The very energies re
leased by the court's decision dragged the ques
tion before the tribunal for answer. /
â¢ A man Is at work digging In the ground, as
he ha* a right to do.' and as the laws of the
country' invite him to <5o and as the people
at lanre rejoice to see him do. He has felt
himself prot*cted in his labors by his stakes.
Here comes this excellent decision of the court
that robs him of this protection. Bight men
form a company, as under the law they have
a right to do; they stake eight -adjoining
claims 160 acres, which Include the twenty
acres where the maa . is working, getting^ to
bedrock as fast as his muscles will admit. They
go upon a distant part of their big holding'
with quick ' acting , machinery - and get to | bed
rock far in advance of the man. and go Into
the recorder's office and file a discovery. : The
man and hie mere : muscles ; are out of It.

-to Hold Last Clam-Bake
' of This Season Sunday
The fleet of the San Francisco Yacht
Club will cruise to Paradise Cove this
afternoon and evening and will drop
anchor' there for the night. The tide
is" not favorable for a run up the bay.
as it is high water at Fort Point at 1:08
p. m. to-day and low water at the same
poinj at 7:10 p. m. Tachts that start
about 8 p. m. from Sausalito will be
pretty cure of making the rendezvous.
However, to compensate for the unfav
orable tide, there is a full moon, so that
a pleasant night may be expected at
the cove.
The fleet will be Joined to-morrow by
other yachts, the tide, which floods
until 1:30 p. m. at Fort Point, serving
well for a run Into the upper bay. A
clambake and pports will be held on
the chore. As the Corinthian yachts
men have no event on their schedule
for to-morrow, it is likely some of them
will cruise to Paradise Cove.
The fleet of the California Yacht Club
will cruise to Point. San Mateo to-day
end will drop ' anchor there for the
night. To-morrow a clambake will be
held. On Sunday, the 24th inst, a race
for the Vincent handicap trophy, pre
sented by Commodore Robert Vincent,
is set down on the schedule. Commo
dore Vincent and his family being" jpn
a trip to Alaska, the race may not : be
held.
The tenth annual regatta of the-Pa
cific Interclub Yacht Association on
Admission day was quite successful
and produced some interesting racing.
A fresh wind and a strong ebb tide
made the race fast. Of : . the twenty
yachts entered in the six classes all
but one, the e'.oop Mischief, started, and
of the nineteen that started all except
Sherry's Perhaps finished. Of the
twenty thirteen were Corinthian boats,
four flew the San Francisco burgee
and three, sailed under the flag of ;the
California Yacht Club. First places in
*dJ the classes except the 30-foot class
were taken by Corinthian yachts. Ruby
winning the Law cup for 20-footers,
Neva capturing the trophy In the 25
foot class. Truant In the yawl class.
Presto in the 36-foot class and Nixie in
the 4 4 -foot class. The cloop Challenger
walked away from her competitors In
the 30-foot class, beating the sloop
Aeolus by 27 minutes 11 seconds. The
fastest time over the full course was
made by Frank. Stone's sloop Presto in
the 36-foot class, which covered the 13
mlle course in 2:02:34, beating Challen
ger's time of 2:07:40 by s" minutes 6
seconds. All the cups except the. Law
cup for 20-footers belonged to the fifth
scries presented by Commodore Joseph
VL Macdonough. The winners "of first
place in each class also receive the blue
pennant of the Pacific Interclub" Yacht
Association, and the yachts taking sec
ond place, viz., the sloops Vixen" and
Discovery, the yawl lola, the sloops'
Aeolus, Harpoon and Speedwell, get the
red pennant of the association. The
race between the sloops Speedwell and
Xixle In the 44-foot class was remark
ably close, Fulton Berry's fast boat,
sailed by her owner, winning by only
17 seconds, after giving an allowance
of 4 minutes 20 seconds to Commodore
Jennings' craft. . , '
The handicap race, which was to have
been, held in. connection and simultan
eously with the regular races in each
class, came to but little, tas the \ only
two yachts that used no" light sails and
bo qualified for the handicap event were
P. TV." Martin's sloop Neptune and Frank
Raymond's sloop Kathleen. Murthin
had not entered bis boatfor the handi
cap, but as he stated^that no notice had
reached him from tW. secretary of the
Corinthian Yacht Club, he was permit
ted to enter it after the : regatta com
mitted- had considered the case, vrhe
Neptune beat the sloop* Kathleen. in the
3G-foot class by a* margin of I:3s, cor
rected time, and won the handicap flag.

The California Yacht Club's freak
yacht \u25a0 Perhaps did not i perform â¢ well,
her throat halyards carrying away}. The
sloop Alert sailed after. Perhaps to ! lend
Jielp and lost so much /time that-, she
was out -of, the race," finishing third in
the^SO-foqt class. J.J.* Sherry's Perhaps
did not finish. ; -'^atak

Oartmen has fbade- arrangements for.?:a'
special match race in. outrigged- skiffs be
tween F. J. Sherry of the Dolphin Swim

the 4 Dolphin Club, has \u25a0 offered 1 a trophy
for'^n outrigged skiff race to be held: in
Octoter,. for men T who*. have not taken
part in any skiff contest. The affair has
been placed in " the hands' of - the enter
tainment committee.; "As ; there are sev
eral ambitious young members -in the
Dolphin Club, it is expected the f contest
wfll excite considerable interest.

PLAY OPENS
ON COURTS
Tennis Enthusiasts Are
J Hdme From Their
Summer Outing;
- Â»
The tennis players are returning
from- out-of-town resort* on* by on*
and i the courts,* which have been more
or.y less deserted during the summer
months; are. again "being taxed. to thetr
capacity. Especially Is this so at the
California Club, many of the members
of vwhich go out of town for the sum
mer. At the park 'it has' not been so
noticeable, as players are much , more
numerous.
\u25a0 ', Only one championship tournament
remains to be played this year. This is
the annual : Bay Counties championship
and i will bring together all *of the
cracks. J. I>. MacGaffn -won" the everr?
last year, but in his absence tbo title
will go to a new player.' All of the ex
perts who figured in the events at San
Rafael \u25a0 last week , will be in the com
petition, with the exception of Hunt
and â¢ the two Southern California play
ers,; who cut little or no figure In tha
singles tournament. :.
There will also be a doubles tourna
ment: for. the championship of the bay
counties. Both events will be held on
the courts in Golden Gate Park. The
winner. of the singles will possess the.
Lloyd trophy for a year." 'Two new
cups will be donated for the doubles.
It* is. to be hoped Coast Champion
.George .Janes and Fred Adams, tha
runner-iip; will meet ': In the singles.
Adams will surely enter and It Janes
does not sidestep the two \u25a0 cracks are
' almost v sure \u25a0 to ; come together. Janes
proved his superiority at San Rafael on
the 9th, but many of the Golden Gato
Club I members claim Adams was not at
his i best. Janes-Is a game player, and
as- he enters all -of the events jit is
reasonable to suppose he will be In the
i coming tournament.' , The tourney will
commence October' land will becom-
I pie ted If possible on the following Sun
day. The fall season at the California
Clutfiwin undoubtedly be a' lively one.
Many new players have Joined the club
of late and the numerous tournaments
which will -be '\u25a0\u25a0 held - will have ; large
entry lists. The "first event to be played
will'be a doubles for the Di
rectors" cups. This tournament Is set
for to-morrow. Â«J^g^BÃ(HÃ - j
- The* cups, are In the possession of C^
J.; Smith and"A.-E. Beyfuss, who .won
the"; last .tournament ;of '.the kind. A
class singles tournament will be held
a 'week from Sunday. Tr " :
Ci The ">â¢ directors " of , the V club will . hold
theirs monthly meeting j next Tuesday
night; when a nominating committee to
arrange a ticket for the annual election
of !Omcers.willlbe : appolnted." The elec
tion 1 ! ' of directors - 1 takes place on the
last - Saturday i in; September.
*_* On the" Park courts to-day a handicap
mixed; doubles-tournament will be
played. -The .teams will, be" mado up of
the 'members of the Ladles' Annex and
Golden Gate Junior clubs. M 133 Crock
ers, and Â» AL' â¢ McLoughlin '. won ;\u25a0 the ; last
event' and > will be .one of : the scratch
teams. 1 - 1 " - . \u25a0* .;*\
'4".; This ~is :.the first .. year . tai -.the history
of tennis ? at San Rafael that,two-out
of-three^set matches ; have ' been , played
In a championship tournament. It was
tried ' in Jul y and met with the approval
of 'the*; players. { Future championship
events as well as minor tournaments
will contain mo five set matches, except
in I the [finals. V Had \u25a0 this been done ear
lie*r| several cracks who (formerly ap
peared [at c San' Rafael ', would not ; ha y â¢
been 'forced to retire.
.7;* The; systematic calling of foot faults
in'- : \"th'e '\u25a0 ; tournaments V Just Â« completed
caused some of ths contestants consid
erable annoyance, but It is undoubtedly
a* step ' in' the right \ '.That th^*
server; has a 1!a 1 ! great Advantage has j lons]
been * an : undisputed fact ' and the pow
ers â¢. in .the f tennis Jworld T have - for V a
long; time been : trying \ to* devise means
to % cut do wn . this j/advantage. It ."â¢ has
even been suggested to cut the member
of {services in each courts : from two Ito
one, J but " this Vis ; out .' ' of 1 the ; question.
Strict. observance of t the foot fault rule
"will: do "more" to \ equalize; matters than
anything * else. ;_ It, is Uo~ be hoped foot
faults will tbe? called In {every f tourna
ment iln Jfuture.\whether -it ; be a small
or|a^ large i event.:;:; Hunt "was the only
one of ithe' four, contestants. ln the finals

Hawthorne, Forced to Ciy.
Enough" by. a Condiietpr
LOUISVILLE.- -Sept.. 13.â Ed- Corrlgan,
master of; Ha wthornei track, was, forced
to cry enough in a- rough-and-tumble flght
witn a "street car" conductor -here -to-day.'
Corrigan .was on his way to Churchill
Downs, and when the conductor failed to
stop the" car at the track Corrigan, struck
"him." ' The -conductor . retaliated '- with. a'
swing to "the- face, -.knocking Cbrrlgan
down. The" master "of got up,'
onlj; to be -floored again."' He' then", cried
enough and got off the car.
This Is taken as an indication that the
old fighting spirit has left "Big Ed," as
he rather prided : himself on his ability
as a rough-and-tumble fighter in '. the old
days. "
SCOTTISH' BOWLERS SHOW
ACTIVITY OX THE GREEK
Much Interest Manlf eÂ«ted In the Dou
ble* Tournament -3fow. in" Pro
;. I Â£&**'. at the Parfc \u25a0
There Is unusual activity among the
Scottish bowlers at present and they
will be kept busy until the rainy sea
son sets In. A handicap doubles tour
nament was started on Labor; day and
the contestants are taking: more inter
est in It than in any. event held In, the
past. Already twenty-five matches
have been played- It is a round robin
affair, in which each team meets every,
other team and the team with the high
est percentage Is declared. the winner.
As there are twenty-one teams in the
tournament -more ; than 200 matches
must be played before its completion.
Tournaments held In the. past have
dragged, but with, its start the tourna
ment under way should keep the*play
ers' interested until its finish.; : The
handicaps are liberal and every team
entered has an" excellent chance to car
ry off the honors. ' This is the first time
a handicap tournament has been "at
tempted and it is safe to say it will not
be the last.- The teams, with their
handicaps, are:

'flt.-wras.'lowa day at thÂ© Elghtli Â»treÂ«t
baseball. lot . yesterday afternoon. Blex
rud, Hackett and Richards all-knew this,
for each ;of -thÂ«nTl waded In - when hits
.were needed and * came 'through, v I with the
kind that broke* up the game. Befora tha
lowans:,became, energetic, and. put two
.overt it . was a deadlock, i and , the result
looked Uke an even: break. There was no
more uncertainty .when' the cornfed kidÂ»
had finished. â¢. - " - ,:
."It all'came'bff in the seventh. Richards
sent a Texas leaguer to center, and so
did Hackett. ' moving Richards to third.
Blexrud was not to be . outdone by , bis
fellow lowans. for " he,' too. chopped a
hard-looking one to the same place, scor
ing Richards. Just to break up the mo
notony/ and show ' that California also
figure* In ball games, .Papa Van Haltren
swung c through to center and Hackett
fumed and puffed himself over the pan.
That made the " Oaks winner by a coupl*
of tengthsl'SgfiÃSHgÃMÃMjÂ£Â»
' Blexrud , bowed himself Into popular
fancy by pitching steady ball against tha
Seals. He is a" nervous young man. with
plenty of speed and, a' delivery that looks
puzzling to fan : and - batsman alike. His
curves * are r* sharp.' â¢ and \u25a0he seemed . to " bo
there In "every, line . except control at ' tha
proper. moment. He was bad on the wane
when he ; should have been , steady, but
luck favored him and he won.
The only time the. Seals figured was dur
ing the fourth spasm, when Gochnauer
walked and Wilson dumped a hunt at tha
plate ) for - a sacrifice.' Willfams* out ad
vanced the ". runner,, and . he came In , as
"Waldron hit over second. Mohler goi
away .with a hard one to Kelly, and on 1
Brick Devereaux's wild heave of Hllde-^
brand's ' grounder Waldron arrived. Moh
ler ; was ' frozen out at tbe pan.
- With a full house in the fourth and not
one yet ' sent to the cemetery, . the \u25a0 Seals
were -unable to put one over. Waldron
started .with a Dingle over third, Mohler
drew a ticket and H :! deb rand got a 3 lap
on': the slats. Alon? came Xealon with a
strikeout and Irwin with a dinky fly .to
right field. Â« Spencer lined a clean single
into", right. _ but ' loafed a * bit â¢. on* the trip
and- Kruger. threw him out at first, bring
ing an inning of rensatlons to an end with
the most sensational play of the day. Th*

money to 4 per cent is giving the bolls a
chock."
Dick cays: "There are persistent rumors
that negotiations are ender \u25a0way for 1 the en
gagement of ecmething like $5,000,000 gold
for Import. Impossible to confirm this. It
is believed that the little flurry In money to
day was due largely to Standard Oil dividend
payments, which amount to. $6,000,000, and the
Consolidated Gas dividend of $1,600,000."
The Ralstu Market.
A mail report from. New. York says:
"As the time approaches for the opening of
the ne-Â»- season Interest In the California Raisin
titcaticn lncre&sea and is the snore pronounced
because of the practically bare condition of the
market. A year, ago at this time there was
carried on the* coast some IS.OOO tons of loose
Muscatel Haislne. while to-day there is eaid
to be all tokl not store than 1000 tons. . The
Â£f soci&Uon has not yet come into the market
as 8e!lerÂ» of new crop goods at fixed prices,
but outside sellers on the coast are said <to
have taken many orders and are now Quoting
4%c t. 0..b. coast for 2-crowns, 5%c for 3
crowns and 6c for 4-crotrns, which at the
. present cost of roods in the sweat box are con.
tidered to be low prices. Laic advices from
The coast state 4c and in some Instances 4%0
is being paid for Raisins in - the sweat bex,
aad 1 as the crop Is undoubtedly short â about
l>o per cent lese than last year, according to
, come estimatesâa further advance In the near
future is expected. Though the crop will bÂ«
short, its Quality will be exceptionally good.
A condition which might threaten the stability
of the market was the refusal of the buyers
to receive deliveries of Muscat Grapes from
the growers, pending the settlement of Ques
tions raised by 'the recent amendment of the
ls.w relating to the manufacture of sweet
wines. It is believed, however, that the Gcv
(tTzt=aect will not insist upon -full compliance
JÂ±s tbe new law this year, since the season
."t(Â» far advanced that to do bo would- estall
v; r. the wineries an unreasonable expense as
well as annoyance. In that event the wineries
will absorb ttie usual Quantity of,. Muscats.
which otherwise would have been converted
into Rairins." /

NEW TORK. Sept. 15. â The money market
s'tuaUcn exerted its influence on stocks 10-day
and checked the eCcrts by professional dpera
tors to lift prices. The Influence of the money
situation was due more to' the prospect of - a
poor bask statement than to any . actual oper
atiosf in the k>aa market, although the 4 per.
cent rate touched fcr money on call registered
the Tr.&rtrnnm for the season thus far and
served &s an admonition of the actual - scarcity
of funds. Scone of the developments weVe of a
character to be regarded as important at any
Oder tirae. but were overshadowed : more re
cently by the money Question: The demon
stration for wresting control of the Wabash
system from its present â¢ hands caused a sharp
advance in -the securities of that company. But
hoctii^ demonstrations among railroad own
*rs *Â£.nd capitalists are not relished by stock
. rr.arkct operators and the effect of the news on
Â»-\u25a0:-:_: list became more disturbing than other
Â«^:-tee. There wa* a. dread, that the : contest
â¢ mirtt veil a struggle between van Interests be
hind the nominal contests, which might cause
disastrous censequeaces to the s:ock - market. -
Contrary inferences were drawn^Nsa the an
nouncement of the passing ct ' control of * the
Cinclcsaii. Hamilton and . Dayton system to J.
P. Morgan & Co.. as It was believed the effect
woaid be harmonization of "the rarious com
p&sits. There was a disposition to draw an
analogy with the Louisville and Nashville pur
chase, regarding - which . Mr. Morgan . made a,
t taiement en ihe witness stand that he was
influenced by the purpose to keep it out of the
hands which he regarded as unsafe. There Is a
iruspScicn that a similar purpose applied to the
present cai^e and the outcome was a
relief 10 stock market stnttmert. Continuing
in the anilory-wtth the Louisville and Nash
\-ille and also the Hocking Valley c&se, it was
considered tlxix the newly acquired property
wocid be parceled out among various compa
nies with a common interest in its control.
The effect of this supposition had to do with
the special strength of Chesapeake and Ohio.
although the rumors also were in circulation of
â¢ an intention- to increasa the dividend on that
stock. Estimates of the week's currency move-
Best 'differed widely, but only in the amount of
tfaeir excess over that loss to the batiks by the
cub-Treasury absorption of funds. Tfcls had
reached $6,270,000 up to Thursday, with one
mere day to Sjnire in the result as it will show
In the bank etatement. Confidence is feu that
the process cf shifting of loans from banks to
trust companies has been continued In suf
ficient Joree to affect the showing of loan re
duction by, th*. banks and the conservation of
tfaeir reserves wtthln the legal - limit. Nothing
developed from yesterday's ramon of further
large gold engagements for Import. A reduc
tion in the price of copper was an Incident of
the day. . The volume, Â©f: sales underwent con
siderable shrtnkar* for j the day and the dull
ness was prcgrÂ«*ivie op to the close. The

BITTER FIGHT
OVER PICTURE
Railroad Magnate Is Suing
Dealers Over Price * Paid
for Thad Welch Painting
ART VERSUS BUSINESS
Interesting Light Thrown
on Relative' Worth of
Gilt Frames and Genius
If a picture costs $350 unframed and $760
framed, what is the use of being an
artist? That Is the question being
thrashed out in Judge Seawell's court. An
indignant railway magnate, A. W. Foster,
president of the California Northwestern
Railroad, wants to recover the' difference.
Foster declared in Judge Seawell's court
yesterday that he had originaally agreed
with P. N. Julliard, representing Schuss
ler Brothers, to pay $350 for a Marin
County scene by Thad Welch, the famous
California painter. When the picture was
furnished a bill was presented to Foster
by Julliard for $760. The magnate was so
attracted by Welch's work that he paid
the price, but under protest.
Much acrimonious correspondence was
exchanged between Schussler Brothers
and Foster over the transaction, and Fos
ter finally filed suit for $410, the difference
between the original price agreed and the
price of the ' picture after it had been
twice framed.
Julliard on the stand talked about
morning lights and sunsets, -, art and
Marin County and other matters not con
nected directly with the dispute. The
court pinned him down to facts with dif
ficulty, aided by the objections of Attor
ney Van Wyck. v .
Julliard testified that ho had to devote
two weeks of his time exclusively to ob-^
tain the picture, and declared that his
services were worth $10 a day to the firm.
On cross-examination he admitted that
he was paid $125 a month and commis
sions. He declared that during his last
Interview Foster "bullied me like the dir
tiest railway laborer." Questioned as to
the values of picture frames. Julliard in
timated that he had a soul above picture
frames. The case was continued..
