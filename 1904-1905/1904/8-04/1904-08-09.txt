The great locomotive, with the boiler

A quarter of a mile to the east, wher-3
this gorge of death debouched into tho
Fountain, lay the chair car, windows
gone, three-fourths filled with mud and

that Dolnt , on f or , four . or five mile3
vestiges of the coaches, the engine and
tender stuck ud from the bed of the
stream or lay along the shore or en the
islands. Red plush seats of the smoker
were strewn along the stream. Brass
rails from the coaches were found in
the sand a half-mile from the. site of
the bridge, and pieces of the baggage
car stuck out of the water in several
places.
Bits of clothing â coats, skirts and
women's hatsâ were found in the
brush along the shore and the search
ers scanned the foliage for bodies.
Masses of earth had caved In from the
The end of the Pullman car Ashmere
extended four feet over the brink, .while
broken timbers and twisted rails hung
still farther over. The arroyo had been
widened to more than a hundred feet
at the point where the bridge had been.
The water tore a zigzag course across
the prairie to a depth of thirty feet in
several places. There was but little left
of the baggage carâ a few rods, a truck
or so, dimly seen in the muddy water;
a, half-burled iron safe. /
. The baggage car, smoker and chair
car followed the locomotive into the
stream and were swept away. All of
the occupants of these cars save three
men perished, and had not the roof of
the chair car burst asunder none would
have escaped. The fireman as the loco
motive went over was thrown out, and
managing to grasp a piece of wreckage
from the bridge floated with that to a
curve made by the caving bank and
crept out of the water. He ran toward
Eden, meeting on the way Operator F.
M. Jones and his wife, who had already
started up the track. They had seen
the headlight of the approaching train
a minute before, and- then had wit
nessed it disappear with ominous sud
denness.
"Notify Pueblo," came the voice of
the running man. "The train's gone
down and everybody Is killed."
Even as he spoke, relates the oper
ator, there were cries coming from the
distance. The two men ran to where
the bridge had been to search, but in
vain, for victims of the disaster. "When
they reached the spot all cries for help
had ceased. " .

In shortly after midnight, with J. M.
KHlin of Pueblo, whose escape was
miraculous; H. S. Gilbert, Tony Fisher
and Fireman Mayfleld. These were the
four men in the midst of the wreck who
escaped, I When dawn came the wonder
was that four had been permitted to
emerge from the raging torrent with
breath still in their bodies.
CURRENT'S AWFUL FORCE.
..i So', quietly had the catastrophe been
enacted that the occupants of the three
cars remaining . on the track did not
realize that an accident had occurred
until they alighted. from the train, and
they were utterly powerless to render
any assistance to the victims who had
disappeared in the rushing waters.
On the lookout for dajiger, warned
by the squally: clouds and heavy rains
to the north. Engineer Charles Hind
man was running cautiously;- about
fifteen miles an. hour/ as he approached
the arroyo, which was spanned by a
bridge ninety-six feet in length. The
condition of the bridge was not .known
until the locomotive, one of the mon

crossed. Â¦ Fireman Frank Mayfleld, with
a large torch which the engineer and
fireman had been, using to ascertain
the condition of the track, . was in the
gangway. When Engineer Hindman
felt the tremor in the -. great machine
and caught a glimmer on. the water, he
shouted his last words, "put out that
torch," .evidently, thinking that in the
accident he felt certain was coming the
flames would serve to spread fire.
But, - before : Mayfleld could obey,

of the doomed engineer and .his hand

PUEBLO, Colo., Aug. 8.â The wreck
of the World's Fair flyer on the Denver
and Rio, Grande Railroad near Eden,
seven miles north of Pueblo, last even
ing, proves to have been one of the
most appalling railroad disasters in the
history . of. this country. . Two crowded
passenger cars and a bacg.ge car were
engulfed in the torrent that tore out
a trestle spanning . Steele's Hollow,
otherwise known as Dry. Creek, and.
so. far as known to-night, only three of
the occupants of those cars escaped
death. Fortunately, two sleepers and
a^diner, completing the train, remained
on the track at the Â«_dge of the abyss
and none of their occupants were killed
or. injured.
â¢How man perished probably will
never.be ."-â¢flnitely ascertained, for the
treacherous sands are drifting* over the
bodjes. - Search for the dead was begun
at midnight on an exter.sive scale and
was ..still, in progress to-night. All
corpses found were brought to Pueblo
and placed in four morgues here. At
id' /o'clock to-night eighty-seven
bodies had been recovered and of .these
fifty, had been identified. During the
day, bodies were recovered all the way
along Fountain River from the scene
of'the wreck to this city. At 1 o'clock
this afternoon two bodies were taken
from the stream at First street, Pueblo,
more than eight miles from the point
where the disaster occurred, and it- is
probable that some may be recovered
even -farther down stream.
None of the bodies are badly muti
lated and all are- in ' such condition
as to be recognizable. Many identi
fications have been made by articles
found on the bodies.
"ENGINEER DIES AT HIS POST.

"Telegrams received to-day from

Askold, Pallada and Novik and some
gunboats steamed out of the harbor on
July 26 for the purpose of bombarding
the enemy's positions. They were at
tacked by the Japanese ; battleship

and two second-class cruisers, with
thirty torpedo-boats.
"An eight-inch shell from the Bayan
burst in the stern of the Itsukushima,

"Our ships, preceded by mine

WASHINGTON, Aug. 8. â Successful
experiments in feeding silkworms on
various colored substances so as to

ported to the State Department by
John C. Covert, United States Consul
at Lyons. France. Consul Covert tells
cf his visit to the laboratory of Comte

have been caried on. He said:
"The object of their studies was to
discover, if possible, why some breeds
of silk worms produce white silk,
while others produce yellow or yellow
ish green silk. Their experiments
showed them that the natural coloring
matter of the cocoons was identical
with the coloring matter found in the
leaves. The experiments prove
that coloring matter introduced
into the intestines of the worm â¢ by
means of food may under certain con
ditions reach the silk through the
blood.

A second party farther down the
river found several persons entangled
in a mass of debris, thought to have
been part of the baggage car, which
was literally torn to pieces. In a short
time a large number of bodies were dug
out of the sand here. One woman was
completely buried, save one foot, wliich
stuck above the water. 'Some bodie3
were found lodged in the shrubbery
along the banks: others in the wreck

quired eight strong men to lift the wa
ter-soaked body of one woman to the
shore and a skirt and hat found on the
bank could scarcely be lifted with the
fingers of one hand.
â¢ Many of the bodies were almost
naked, the clothing having been torn
completely off. Most of them were
slightly bruised, probably from the
first shock of. the wreck, but there was
little blood visible when they were re
moved from the stream. Without
doubt the great majority were drowned
like rats in a trap when the cars
plunged without a moment's warning
into the whirling water, thirty-five
feet deep, a hundred feet wide, ana
with a current strong enough to carry
thousands of pounds of weight nearly
a mile before subsiding.
THRONGS OF ANXIOUS SEEKERS.
When brought ashore the bodies were
placed on the ground and covered, but
persons who wished to look at them
were allowed to do so for the purpose
of identifying them. A baggage car
was kept running between the city and
the wreck, bringing in those who were
found. A number of wagons were final
ly pressed into service to haul the bod
ies to the tracks, leaving the searchers
free to continue the hunt for others.
Some searchers Worked all nlsht and
all day and never once thought of eat
ing or. resting.
Persons were constantly arriving and
anxiously inquiring for lost ones
known to have been on the train. By
9 o'clock this morning the plains were
dotted with vehicles, each with its load
of anxious seekers or the morbidly cu
rious. More than a thousand persons
were on the scene two hours before
noon and the roads in every direction
were crowded by others coming away.

very slowly because many of them
were those of strangers here, who had
been to the fair at St. Louis and at

Nobody would pretend that there has

crime. Under such circumstances he
should certainly be esteemed " sane

among those prone to commit . this

plenty of a temper so fiendish or so
brutal as to be incompatible with any

more tends to encourage crime among
such men than the belief that through

Commons to-day Premier Balfour, re
plying to a question on the subject,
said the British Government adhered
to its contention that there was no
adequate justification for the sinking
of the British steamship Knight Com
mander by the Vladivostok squadron.
The Premier made a general state
ment of the Government's views on
the Malacca and Knight Commander
incidents. He pointed out that the
Government's objection to the seizure
of the Malacca was based entirely on
the British contention that ships is
suing from the Black Sea under the
commercial flag of Russia were in
competent to transform themselves
Into cruisers.
"I confess," said Balfour, "that I
have not the smallest feeling of regret
that we did our best to meet the Rus
sian Government, who on their side
made no impracticable suggestions in
the matter. Regarding the Knight
Commander, she was sunk on the
ground that it was extremely difficult
to bring her into port and because, in
the opinion of the Russian officers,
she was carrying contraband. We ad
here to our opinion that these circum
stances, whether true or not, afford
no excuse for sinking a neutral ship."

The Japanese made a final attempt
to break through the Russian line at
7 o'clock in the evening, but were re
pulsed and the Russians held all their
positions until nightfall, when they
retired on Haicheng.
The Red Cross agents worked
bravely all day under fire.
The Russians managed to disable
four other Japanese guns in* the course
of the day. The Voronezh Battalion
was thrown against the Japanese po
sition in the afternoon and got within
a twenty-yard range, under a fierce
fire, and then took the bayonet and
carried the Japanese position, but lost
half its men and was surrounded and
forced to retire. Later in the after
noon the remnants of the same bat
talion ambushed and almost wiped out
a Japanese battalion.
LIAOYANG. Aug. 8. â A correspond
ent of the Associated Press, who was
with the Third Battery throughout the
fighting at Simoucheng on July 31,
says a large battery on an early morn
ing battle forced two of the Russian
center companies to retire, but the
heavy artillery fire of the Russians,
together with a terrific crossfire from
the Irkutsk and Yenisei batteries, pre
vtnted the enemy capturing the va
cated position.
The Japanese, with several columns,
again tried to force the Russian center
at 10 o'clock, but the Russian bat
teries drove them back in confusion.
At noon the Kosloff Battalion at
tacked the Japanese positions in the
hills on the Russian left, under cover
of a heavy fire from the Third and
Fifth batteries. The Japanese met the
attack with shrapnel, but the Rus
sian artillery temporarily silenced the
Japanese fire and enabled the Kosloff
Battalion to carry the position. The
Japanese commander in chiefs head
quarters flag appeared on the left, but
the Japanese were driven back by the
fierce fire of the Third Battery and
the Saviski Battery, the commander of
which received a message of thanks
for his services.
In the meantime the Kosloff Bat
talion lost 50 per cent of its men and
called for reinforcements, which were
sent from the Irkutsk and Yenisei
hattalions, the men fighting their way
to the support of their comrades over
a road which the soldiers say was
literally paved with Japanese corpses.
The Fifth Battery then became an
object of interest. A battery of heavy
caliber Japanese guns was brought up
from the rear and sustained an un
equal action for some time, but lost
two-thirds of its men and was forced
to retire with six of its guns shot to
pieces. These were left on the posi
tion useless.

LONDON. Aug. 8.â Lord Percy, the
trrder Foreign Secretary, announced
to-day in the House of Commons that
Germany. Austria and Italy, as well as
Ku^s-ia. had given their assent to the
Egyptian clauses of the Anglo-French
agreement and had undertaken not to
Obstruct British action in Egypt. Great
Brilain in return had given assurances
that they would receive the most fa-
A'ored nation treatment for their com

ised to reject their treaty rights in
fcgypt, give their schools the same lib
erties as heretofore and allow the of

Egyptian service the same advantages
as enjoyed by British subjects.

: SATISFIES THE POWERS
'. SEATTLE. Wash., Aug. S. â General
: _Giorly. chief signal officer, of the
'.i'nited States army, this evening re
ceived the first telegraphic message
'ever sent direct from Nome, Alaska.
It marks ihe inauguration of the Gov
ernment wireless line from Nome 107
miles to St. Michael. General Greely
said tho receipt of the message indi
:ccted that the wireless line was work
Â¦lng: perfectly. From St. Michael the
. message came by the wire line up the
"Yukon to DawBOn and thence to Seat
. lie. traveling DiiOO miles altogether.
. Geaeral Greely returned to-day from
Eitka. He received a cable message
.from the Government cable-ship Burn
eide, no-.v laying the cable from SItka
â¢to Seattle. The vessel is now off Queen
: Charlotte Sound. It reports having
laid- 227 miles of cable from noon yes
.terday to 6 o'clock this morning. Gen
*.<ral Greely says the cable will doubt
less be in Seattle by August 10.
The vehicles used by the Russians
in removing their wounded included
bicycles, used in pairs with a litter
swung between them. A detachment
of six cabs was also sent out on J*uly
26 to bring in Russian wounded. On
the 27th these cabs returned for more
wounded to a place they had visited
the "flay before. It was found,' however,
that this place was then occupied by
the Japanese, who. captured the outfit
of. cabs.
On July 27 two detachments of ma
rines and soldiers, numbering 260, lost
every commissioned officer as a result
of the first volley fired by the Japa
nese. The men of this detachment
thereupon sent a delegation to Major
General Kondratenko and requested
that he send to them the officers under
whom they had previously performed
exceptionally brilliant services, and for
which General Stoessel had sent them
special thanks.
By the night of July 27 the Russian
soldiers had been fighting for forty
eight hours with a minimum of rest,
food and water. They were then re
lieved by reserves, who arrived at the
lines led by bands playim? the na
tional anthem. At the conclusion of
the^anthem cheers were given along
â¢ The Russian mines were cleverly
concealed in an open field. The ex
plosion of these mines threw the rocks
for a distance of one or two versts." It
Is alleged that with the exception of
four men, who . were captured, two
squadrons of Japanese cavalry were
annihilated by the explosion of such
mines.
The witnesses confirm previous
statements that the Japanese losses in
this fighting were severe. The Japa
nese soldiers advanced to Wolf Hill
over ground thickly strewn with their
dead. They occupied the hill. By the
third day the stench from the decom
posing bodies, which were not interred
for lack of time, became intense. Jap
anese prisoners are quoted as saying
that one of the narrow streets of a
Chinese village, which was made the
target of Russian batteries, was
packed with dead and wounded men.
BICYCLES CONVEY LITTERS.
A refugee who witnessed the fight
ing at Wolf's Hill of July 26 and July
27 declares that 4000 Russian troops
defended the position, all approaches
to which had been protected with ter
races at angles of forty-five degrees.
In many instances the Russian soldiers
dropped their rifles an- rolled rocks
down, upon the enemy, Tith effect more
fatal than their bullets.
This" last party of refugees, several
of whom witnessed part of the three
days' fighting of the week before last,
deny that the Japanese were one verst
(.66 of a mile) from the Russian fort
ress. They say that the Japanese
troops are from ten to fifteen versts
from the Inner forts.
The Japanese are busy endeavoring
to work their trenches nearer to the
fortress. The Russian resistance to
these efforts is confined to the use of
artillery, which ceaselessly harasses
the diggers. The Japanese are said to
have sixty guns in position on Wolfs
Hill and vicinity, and it evidently is
their intention slowly and surely to
tighten their noose around Port Ar
thur.
NOOSE SLOWLY TIGHTENS.
The refugees report that the Russian
cruiser Bayan was struck by a frag
ment from one of the mines which
the Japanese constantly send in toward
the harbor entrance. The explosion oc
curred at the spot just previously va
cated by the Russian- gunboat Giliak.
which had been In that position for
months, acting as guardship. The
Bayan bears' marks of projectiles of
various sizes, showing that she has
been hit 218 times since the beginning
of the war.
CHEFU, Aug. 9, 11 p. m.â The firing
of heavy guns at intervals of one
minute has been distinctly heard in
the direction of Port Arthur since 10:30
o'clock to-night, the acoustic condi
tions of the atmosphere being unusual
ly favorable.
During the last twenty-four hours
200 Chinese and fifty Russian refugees
have arrived here from Port Arthur.
They left there on August 4. It has
been Impossible to obtain confirmation
of the report of the sinking off Port
Arthur of a Japanese cruiser, but that
this occurred Is not improbable, as the
vessel is said to have sunk In a place
where mines were recently laid.
The French newspaper correspond
ents who made an attempt to reach
Port Arthur by junk saw the Japanese
fleet on August 6. They were twice
arrested and turned back. They heard
nothing of the alleged sinking of the
Japanese cruiser. They counted twen
ty-four vessels of the Japanese' fleet
ranged in a double semi-circle In front
of the harbor.
Marquis Oyanoa, commander in chief
of the Japanese forces In Manchuria
has proceeded north and expects to at
tack LiaoyAig on August 20.
LONDON, Aug. 9.â According to the
correspondent of the Morning Post at
Shanghai it is reported that there are
10,000 sick and wounded persons at Port
Arthur, and that the Russians are ne
gotiating with the Japanese to send the
hospital ship Mongolia away full of
sick. It is reported, the correspondent
says, that Lieutenant General Stoessel,
in command of the military forces at
Port Arthur, has committed suicide and
that panic prevails at Port Arthur.
LIAOYAXG, Aug. 7.â The Western
Russian forces north of Haicheng suf
fered a heavy attack to-day. Many
wounded Russians are here. There is a'
rumor current that General Kuroki is
threatening Mukden from the north
east. Viceroy Alexieff and General Ku
ropatkin were yesterday in Liaoyang.
GENERAL KUROKI'S HEADQUAR
TERS IN THE FIELD. Sunday Aug.
T. â The Russian force, In front of Gen
eral Kuroki's army is reported retreat
ing northward. A part of it has en
camped at Anping, twelve miles from
Liaoyang. Guns were heard this morn
ing on the Japanese right, meaning that
pc-sslbly the Japanese were following
the Russian retirement.
Secretary Hay directs attention to an
Incident in 18S4, when Russia "took oc
casion to dissent vigorously from the
inclusion of coal among articles con
traband of war, and declared that she
would categorically refuse her consent
to any articles in any treaty or instru
ment whatever that would imply its
recognition as such."
Due note is made of the fact that raw
cotton could be made up into clothing
for the military uses of a belligerent,
but the Secretary adds that a military
use for the supply of an army or a gar
rison might possibly be made of food
stuffs of every description which might
be shipped from neutral ports to the
blockaded ports of a belligerent.
"The principle under consideration
might therefore," he says, "be extended
so as to apply to every article of human
use, which might be declared contra
band of war simply because it might
ultimately become useful to a belliger
ent for military purposes."
The Secretary speaks of coal and oth
er fuel and cotton as being employed
for a great many innocent purposes,
and that many nations are dependent
on them for the conduct of- inoffensive
industries, adding:
Â¦'And no sufficient presumption of an
intended warlike use seems to be af-.
forded by the mere fact of their des
tination to a belligerent port."
LONDON, Aug. 8.â The Times and
other London newspapers this morn
ing contain editorials strongly approv
ing the circular issued by Hay, the
American Â¦ Secretary of State, ' as to
what constitutes contraband of war.
The Times says:
"Mr. Hay lays down a sound and
reasonable rule on the subject.* "We
trust our Government will not delay in
letting it be known that we fully share
the views of the United States and that
we shall steadfastly uphold them."
This is a summary of a declaration
by Secretary Hay on^the right of neu
tral nations during war. It was em
bodied in a circular to the American
Embassadors in Europe and was issued
from the State Department on June 10
last, but for some reason was withheld
from the public, although certain ship
pers who inquired at the department
after their rights were supplied with
copies.
The circular is based on a declara
tion by Russia that cotton, naphtha,
alcohol armother fuel were contraband.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 8.â"The recog
nition in principle of the treatment'of
coal and other fuel and raw cotton as
absolutely contraband of war might ul
timately lead to a total inhibition of
the sale by neutrals to the people of
belligerent states of all articles which
could be finally converted to military
uses. Such an extension of the princL
ple by treating coal and other fuel and
raw cotton as absolutely contraband of
war simply .because they are shipped
by a neutral to a non-blockaded port of
a belligerent would not appear to be in
accord with the reasonable and lawful
rights of a neutral commerce."

WASHINGTON, Aug. 8.â Statistics
for the year just ended show that for
the first time in its history Germany
must yield the first place among the
nations in the production of beer to
the United States. Frank H. Mason,
United States Consul General at Ber
lin, in reporting this fact to the State
Department says the falling off in
Germany's production Is largely due
to the. spread of prohibition move
ments in that country, according to
statistics prepared by the German
Brewers' Association. The German
production for the last year declined
to 1,787,615,000 gallons, or 132,085,
230 gallons less than the output of the
United States.

CHEYENNE, Wyo., Aug. 8.â Three
posses are now in pursuit of the four
train robbers who attempted to wreck
and rob the Atlantic Express at Ah
Say, on the Union Pacific, east of
Green River.
At daylight to-day John Utley, the
pump man, discovered the outlaws in
the act of throwing a main line switch
for the siding:, so as to wreck the train,
and he was shot through the arm. He
notified the operator at the next sta
tion and the irain was warned of its
danger. But for the pump man's dis
covery a terrible wreck, with great loss
of life, would have occurred. Utley's
wound is not dangerous.
The bandits, who are believed to be
the same that recently held up the
Denver and Rio Grande Express, are
headed for the Blue Mountains of
Northern Colorado. The posses are
composed of some of the best rangers
in the State, and a battle with the out
laws is certain. That they will be cap
tured is also almost certain. The rob
bers are well armed and mounted, and
appear to know the country thoroughly.

that she never would have been con

The Chronicle also prints an edi

RENO, Nev., Aug. 8. â Passenger
train No. 4, east bound, was wrecked
at Cisco to-night at 7:30 o'clock, being
run into by the push engine of freight
train No. 212 within fifty yards of the
depot.
Only three people were injured, but
that one hundred and fifty or more
passengers on board the train were not
killed is due to the fact that the en
gineers in charge of the two engines
pulling the passenger train brought
their trains to a stop in time.
The injured are: W. E. McCurdy of
2616 Center street, San Francisco, who
was on his way to the World's Fair.
His injuries consist of a painful lacera
tion on the left cheek and under the
eye, together with a number of bruises
about the head and body, caused by
being hit by flying splinters and iron.
Miss Albinson of Minneapolis, who was
returning home from a visit to friends
in California, was injured by flying
glass.
Alfred Goss, a retired , business man
of San Francisco, on his way to Bos
ton, was seriously hurt. He is injured
internally and on account of his ad
vanced age the outcome cannot be de
termined. Dr. Ainswick was on the
train at the time. He was riding in
Superintendent Agler's private car and
as soon as he could extricate himself
from the wreckage in his car went to
work aiding the injured.
The dining-car suffered most. One
end was entirely demolished. The car
was filled with passengers at the time
and the shock was like a thunderbolt.
Women and men were knocked to the
floor, some screaming with fright, oth
ers Intent on escape and still others
thinking of only one thing, to aid the
injured, but fortunately their services
were not needed.

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 8.â After being

been resumed and belated trains are
arriving. Santa Fe trains due here Sat
urday and Sunday arrived this morn

and all trains are moving. The com
pany's local officials believe that the
worst of the flood is now over and
that normal conditions will soon pre
vail.
The heavy rains which have fallen
throughout Arizona during- the past
fortnight are unprecedented. Cloud
burst has followed cloudburst in the
mountains, sweeping down the narrow
canyons and doing much damage to
railroad and other property. The per
manent good effects of the rains are
expected, however, to more than coun
terbalance the temporary loss sus
tained. Growing crops have been great

The interview did not continue after
Vanderbilt had curtly refused to make
this ingenious compromise.
-NEW YORK, Aug. 8.â Newport so
ciety is discussing one of the biggest
"touches" on record. A foreigner be
longing to an excellent family and of
unquestioned social standing visited
young Reginald Vanderbilt recently.
As the story goes, he went at once to
the reason of his visit. He needed a
loan of $100,000.
Vanderbilt was surprised but asked
no questions. He firmly declined to let
his visitor have the money. Then came
a request that added to the piquancy
of the situation.

Vance held on to ihe brake liku
grim death. His hands clenched the
wheel until his fingers almost bled,
but he held on until his tight grip
stopped the car. The forward cars
broke from the sleeper and fell into
the water, while the car which Vance
had held with the brake stbpped one
third of the way on the brink of the
chasm, overhanging the gulch below.
The forward trucks had left the track
and gone down, but the remainder of
the coach stayed on the tracks and
the lives of the passengers were saved.
It required two engines and nearly
a half hour's work to pull this sleeper
back from the brink of the chasm.
Nothing but Vance's cool and brave
work at the brakes kept the car from
plunging 'nto the stream.
Vance . was standing near tha front
end of the car when the crash came
and with rare presence of mind, rushed
to the hand brake on the front of the
car and began tightening the brake3
on the wheels. His car. was slipping
f oi ward from the momentum and
from the terrible drag in front, caused
by the forward cars tailing into the
stream.
EDEN. Colo., Aug. 8. â W. Vance,

disaster. To him and his nerve and
bravery the people on that car owe
their lives.

MILWAUKEE, Aug. 8.â The second
round in the fight between the forces
led by Senator Spooner and those led
by Governor La Follette for the control
of the State will open at Madison to
morrow. The first round took place at
the National Republican Convention
and was won by Spooner.
The Governor and his friends say that
Spooner's victory does not count, as the
national convention has nothing to do
with State affairs. They have the po
litical machinery of the State in their
hands and will place the La Follette
State ticket in the regular Republican
column on the official ballot. "Whichever
side has the official name will have
great advantage.
To prevent this going to the La Fol
lette faction the Spooner men will ask
the Supreme Court to act as referee.
The request will come in the form of a
petition for an alternate writ of man
damus against Secretary of State
House, a La Follette man, demanding
that he place the Spooner ticket in the
regular Republican column or show
cause why. Senator Spooner came here
from his summer home in New Hamp
shire a week ago to consult with the at
torneys on the anti-La Follette side
and to DUt the finishing touches to the
case.
Governor La Follette, through his in
timate friends, says \ that no matter
what the Supreme Court says he will
run. They say he will get votes wheth
er his name is on the front or back of
the official ballot, and that, further
more, they claim he will be elected.

"The car naturally righted, and
when it came up the water was just
above my lips. I could breathe all
right and saw that the transom was
just above me. With my right hand I
smashed out the glass, hoping I could
get out in that way. At that moment
another crash came and I was struck
on the forehead by som. floating ob

Another occupant of the chair car
was J. M. Killin. a well known hard
ware merchant of Pueblo. He was
badly cut about the head, hands and
arms, but no bones were broken, and
he will be entirely recovered within a
few days, if no serious complications
ensue. His, escape was due entirely,
he believes, to his ability as a swim
mer, his great strength and his pres
ence cf mind which led him to hold his
breath while he was submerged with
the other passengers in the water.
"When the first crash came we were
riding along a? smoothly as one could
go." caid Killin. "It was just, as
thuugh ihÂ«> train had struck against
a ctone wall. The lights went out. the
fixtures and everything fell down, all
the passengers were thrown forward
and there were the most awful cries
for help and the grinding of timbers.
I saw a man next to me was down and
I helped him up. but just then another
crash came and the train seemed to
sink about five feet. I lost sight of
everybody and could not think of any
thing but to save myself.
"I remember well the sensations 1
had at the time. I knew I was in terrl
ble danger and my first thought was
that I must get out of the car. At the
second crash I was about up to my
waist in water. All the time the grind
ing and crushing of timbers was going
on. In another crash I was thrown

right up against the front door. I
grabbed the top of the door and the
car went over in the water three times.
My first instinct when the water went
up over my head was to hold my
breath. I think I was under water
for a full minute.
"I was sitting in my office, a dis
tance of a mile from the scene of the
wreck, when suddenly a loud sound,
followed by a series of smaller reports,
startled me. I had heard of No. 11
passing Pinon from the operator there,
and at this time she was overdue more
than six minutesâ an unusual thing,
for the train is a flyer.
"Becoming thoroughly frightened, I
seized my lantern and ran up the
track to the place where the bridge
should have been. The faint rays of
my lamp threw just enough light for
me to distinguish three cars, but be
tween them and myself there was a
chasm fully 50 feet wide, through
which dashed a river almost level with
the ground upon which I stood. Oppo
site me I could make out the outlines
of three cars, but the other four that
usually make up No. 11 were nowhere
in sight.
"I started across the mesa in the
direction of the river, which was high
and making much noise. After walk
ing about half a mile I saw near the
bank a dark object. It was almost
stationary in midstream, with one end
swinging toward the left bank. I
slipped off my clothing and plunged
in. swimming in the direction in which
I had come, as I knew the strong cur
rent would carry me down stream. By
proceeding in this course I managed to
get t<s the object, which proved to be
a chair car. half on its side and held
in position by an arm of land extend
ing into the stream probably fifteen
feet. The roof of the car was gone
and inside there was not a soul to be
found. Guided by the light of my lamp
o-n the shore, I struck out for the bank,
and. being' a strong swimmer, I
reached it in a few moments. The car,
or what was left of it, broke loose and
was completely demolished. It was
then after midnight.
"There wÂ«re two survivors of the
wreck that I knew of, the fireman and
a passenger in a chair car. The lat
ter's story he told me in a dazed man
ner, for the man was nearly border
ing on lunacy. It seems he was sit
ting in the third chair from the rear
of the car when the train turned up
ward and the suddenness precipitated
him through the window and then,
turning him a complete somersault,
landed him on the bank."

"Strangely enough, there was hard
ly any screaming. I listened to hear
the cries, but it was all over in a mo
ment and the coaches whirled away
down the stream with loads of human
beings. Apparently the inmates were
swallowed up in the flood, the water
surging into the coaches and drowning
them instantly."
One of the saddest stories is that of
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Gilbert of Okla

only two months and were on their
honeymoon trip. Gilbert is one of the
three men who marvelously escaped
from the chair car. His wife, who was

said, "near the door. The train had

were going about fifteen miles an hour
when all at once I felt a sudden jolt,

with three coaches whirling down the

coach as I left it was F, H. Messinger,
a banker from Central City. He sat just
behind me, and once came to the end
of the car and it seemed that he would
be saved, but before he could be saved
he went down and was lost.
"As I approached an island I heard
the faint cry of a woman for help. I
answered, shouting: 'I am coming;'
but at that moment I heard a gurgling
sound, as if the^poor unfortunate was

Henry A. Schulze, representing the
San Francisco Chapter of American
Architects, tilted with the Board of
Education to-night over, the adoption
of a notice to architects for.
pl^ns for the proposed new school
buildings. Schulze opened the scrap
by repeating what he said was street
talk â namely, that it was openly as
serted that the winning architect
could be named now and that a type
written copy of instructions to archi
tects had been in the hands of San
Francisco architects before they had
been made public. Schulze wanted
the , board to confer with a commit
tee from the architects, to extend the
time for submitting plans to' October
30 and to order all , plans to be filed
anonymously.
Directors Hardy and Hathaway and
President Wilcox resented what they
declared were aspersions on the
board's integrity. The Directors voted
down the Schulze suggestion touching
anonymous plans. September 30 was
the date fixed for submission of plans.
The call to architects includes the fol
lowing new brick or brick and stone

street, cost $145,000; six to eight room
building for the Grove-street School,
to face Grove street, cost $28,000;

north side of the Lafayette School,
cost 538,000; fourteen to sixteen room
addition to the Grant School, to face
Broadway, cost $81,000; new building,
nine or ten rooms, with allowance for
addition Â¦ to make twenty-two rooms,
on the new site at Market and Thirty
ninth strets, cost $72,000; new build
ing, nine or ten rooms, with allowance
for addition to twenty-two rooms, new
site on Shattuck avenue, adjoining
Bushrod Park, cost $72,000.
Â¦ A premium of 1 per cent above
architects' fees and cost of supervision
will be awarded the successful archi
tects.
The boards voted to purchase two
new school sites, as follows: One from
the Mitchell Real Estate Company,
with frontage of 266 feet on Market
street, 325 on Thirty-ninth and 325 on
Apgar, for $10,000; one from A. F.
Poirier, adjoining Bushrod Park,
north 435 feet on Shattuck avenue by
912 feet east -to Racine street, for
$25,000. .Streets are to be cut through
the latter site.

I don't believe the Chinese have any Idea
that th? Japanese 1 will try to incorporate
Manchuria Into their own territories. And
after the war. If the Japanese win, the
Chinese expect them .to help In reorganizing
their army and enlightening; the masses. The
officials Simons' the Chinese are, of course,
maintaining neutrality, but at the same time
their sympathies are with the Japanese.
ThÂ« feeling among the Chinese Is solid for
the Japanese, thoueli it does not always ap
pear on tbe surface. The Chinese regard the
Japanese as their friends. They expect bet
ter treatment from them than from the Rus
sians. They tblnk .the Russians won't stop
at anything If they win in this war. The
Japanese are consid-ered peaceable and reason
able and more likely to be content with a llttlu
than Russia.
That this sentiment prevails is the
opinion of Professor John Fryer, pro
fessor of Oriental languages and a
friend of the Chinese, who returned to
day from the Orient. Professor Fryer
has entree to the inner circles of Chi
nese life and had a good chance to ob
serve the conduct of the Chinese to
ward the belligerents and to exchange
views with them. Speaking of his ex
periences, Professor Fryer said:
Feeling in and out of official circles
in China is in favor of the Japanese
winning the war that they are now
waging against Russia. To the Japan
ese the Chinese look for assistance In
the rehabilitation of their empire and
the safety of their dominions against
the Russian foe, and while not daring
outwardly to help them they are par
tial in that they give their moral sup
port to the yellow men across the
channel. *

Dr. Payne began practicing medi
cine in Berkeley twenty-seven years
ago. In all that time he never forgot
hip duty and no man or- woman, rich
or poor, ever called in vain upon him
for aid. In spite of a body that was
not robust, in spite of accidents that
had crippled him cruelly, he was de
votion itself to his profession.
Dr. Payne was interested in other
things. City and county politics at
tracted him and he was a member of
a number of clubs and secret orders.
He served as a member of the Board
of Health and was Health Officer for
the town until his term expired in
February last. His name was enrolled
as a member of Durant Lodge of

BERKELEY, Aug. 8.â A martyr to
hi3 own self-sacrifice and devotion to
the care of the suffering, Dr. Frank
Howard Payne, until recently Health
Officer for , Berkeley and the oldest
practicing physician in the town, died
this morning after a three days' ill
ness. Dr. Payne's death is directly at
tributable to his always generous in
stincts and follows his treatment of a
sufferer from whom he could accept
no other payment . than a word of
gratitude. In administering to the
patient' . the contracted ery
sipelas from an accidental abrasion on
his hand. Unmindful of the danger,
Dr. Payne did nothing to counteract
its effects until blood poisoning set
in and then it was too late. Dr. H. N.
Rowell, his friend and associate, was
called in to treat him and later Dr.
Winslow Anderson of San Francisco,
and, with the help of the patient and
his wife, a stubborn battle for life was
begun. But the disease was master
there and soon it got its grip upon his
heart, so that then there was no more
hope. Life 1! ebbed : away just before
dawn this morning. , - .,

grand larceny. She is accused of hav
ing stolen $1000 worth of finery and
bric-a-brac from the Mein home, at
Lake end Jackson streets, where she
was employed. The matter attracted
much attention owing to me fact that
Mrs. Mein has complained that Chier

the girl. His answer to this , has been
that he told Mrs. Mein that she would
have to swear to the warrant and that
she refused to do this.

Advertisements calling for bids to
construct the Alameda County Scenic
Boulevard, between Oakland and Hay
wards, upc-n plans submitted to-day by
County Surveyor Prather were ordered
printed by the Board of Supervisors
at this morning's session, and the work
of the big undertaking can be said to
be fairly under way. It is the most ex
tensive work of the kind ever at
tempted in this county and an esti
mate of the^cost made by Prather
places it at $301,000.
The purpose is to construct a mag
nificent driveway, connecting Oakland
and Hay wards. The proposed road is
to- run along the foothills and gives a
splendid view of the surrounding coun
try. The work of acquiring the right
of way has been going on for several
months and is now . completed. The
surveyor's plans cover the minutest
details of the.w*ork, shov/ing about 150
profile drawings of culverts and
bridges of various sizes, all of which
are. to be constructed of masonry of
the most, enduring character.
Objections to moving a fence by the
heirs of C. S. King and Margaret Wat
son, made before the Supervisors to
day, delayed the work of opening a
road from San Lorenzo to connect with
the main San Iieandro and Haywards
road. The heirs want pay for the* land
and also ask the Supervisors to pay for
the rebuilding of the fences. Super
visor Talcott, in whose district the
proposed road lies, was not ready to
agree to this, and the matter was put
over.

The rel-itive advantages of Alameda over
many of the Eastern cities that I visited
within the last two months are numerous. VÂ»>
have one of the cleanest and best governed
municipalities in the United States. | One thing
that impressed me on my recent trip East was
the commercial value which residents of East
ern cities r>lace on beauty. Nearly every city,
town and village has a civic organization that
boosts its interests. Alameda is to thÂ» Pacific
Coast what Atlantic City is to the Atlantic
Coast. The great Eastern resort has the most
equitable climate on that side of the con
tinent, as Alameda has on this side.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 8.â Matters con
cerning the welfare of this city and
Alameda County were discussed at a
well-attended meeting of the Alameda
Advancement Association, held in the
City Hall to-night. In the absence of
the president of the organization,
George W. Scott, Vice President Philip
S. Teller officiated. The principal
speakers were Edwin M. Stearns, sec
retary of the Oakland Board of Trade,
and Rev. Frank S. Brush, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church, who re
turned last week from an extensive
tour of the Eastern States. Rufus P.
Jennings, secretary of the California
Promotion Committee, was scheduled
to deliver an address, but was unable
to be present. He was represented by
H. A. Wright, who- briefly related what
that body was doing toward advertis
ing California.
Stearns, in the course of his talk,
said:
I am pleased at observing so many present
and at the interest manifested in affairs thai
should appeal to the civic pride of all.
Unanimanity of purpose and action is what
brings results in the promotion of the welfare
of a community. This* portion of California is
now becoming imbued with that' spirit of civic
pride which has made Southern California
amous and prosperous. It Is animating Oak
land, Berkeley. Alameda and thÂ» entire county.
I will take advantage of this opportunity to
put myself right with the residents of Alameda
as to my attitude and the attitude of the Oak
land Board of Trade with respect to the
project of consolidation of the cities on the
east side of the bay. Nine years aÂ«o the
Oakland Board of Trade took up the annex
ation proposition and, after carefully investi
gating It, decided that the time for consoli
dation was not ripe. The. Oakland Board of
Trade has considered tbe matter again of late
and It i3 my opinion and the general senti
ment of the members of that organization that
the time for consolidation Is not yet ripe. When
we of Oakland can offer to Alameda as good
street*, schools, government and other ad
vantages that you now possess superior to uÂ«.
then it will be time for us to sug-pp3t to Ala
meda that she Join Oakland. It appears,
though, that the day of annexation is a Ions
way in the future, but I believe that the time
will come when there will exist the city ami
county of Alameda.

of the morning, and there has
been no one treated at the Re
ceiving Hospital for any injury- that
Â¦would cause so great a loss of blood.
I Another strange feature of the case is
that the man or woman who was at
the door of the Scott home could have
left the vicinity without leaving a trail
of blood. The wounded person was on
the porch only a few minutes, and the
] amount of blood spilled during that
time indicates that the injury was se
vere enough to have left some trace ii
'the party had walked or been carried
away along the sidewalk. There is.
however, no such trace to be seen, apd
the fact that the blood stains end at
the curb would seem to point out that
the injured person had been taken
away in a carriage or wagon.
None of the members of the family
thought in notify the police while the
injured person was on the porch, al
though there is a telephone in the
house, and even this morning when
Scott saw the blood stains on the steps
end Fideivalk he did not notify the au
thority. He simply washed the stains
from the door and the ?teps and turned
the hose on the walls.

HAYWARDS, Aug. 8.â The new
grammar school, over which there has
been contention, was not opened to
day. An election will be held to-mor
row to determine whether a direct tax
of Â£(5000 shall be levied to pay the in
debtedness on the building.
In all cases \Vhere showing of indi
gence Is made the city health authori
ties have vaccinated free of charge. Ap
plications for such treatment can be
made at the offices of the Board of Ed
ucation.
Under direction from the State Board
of Health the Board of Education or
dered a strict adherence to the vaccina
tion law. According to Superintendent
McClymonds there was nothing else to
be done. The only leeway that can be
given is to grant an extension of time
to pupils who shall be reported as not
in physical condition to be vaccinatedl
With respect to such, cases the certifi
cate of a reputable physician must be
presented.
The enrollment of new pupils, those
beginning their school work, has not
leached more than one-half of the num
ber which the School Department of
ficials estimated would be registered.
This is due. they believe, to the fact
that the children nave not been vac
cinated.
Enforcement of the State law requir
ing the vaccination of public school
children caused a perceptible falling oft
in the enrollment of pupils in this city
with the opening of the schools to-day
for the fall term. Approximate figures
ieported to City Superintendent of
Schools J. W. McClymonds show that
there is a drop of between 100 and 500
pupils.

ELECTS XEW GUARDIAN
This Is a suit to enjoin the Auditor from
approving and the Treasurer from paying
salary demands of seven persons appointed by
the Board of Election Commissioners as deputy
registrars. The case now comes before tha
court on a demurrer to the complaint and an
order to etto"w cause why a temporary Injunc
tion should not be issued.
It appears from the complaint that on March
14. 1904, the Board of Election Commissioner*
appointed eeven deputy registrars at a monthly
raiary of $100 each and that none of the per
sona so, appointed had been certified to the
election" commission by the Board of Civil
Service Commissioners. It ls alleged that at
the time there were more than seven candi
dates upon eligible lists of the classified civil
service who could and would have been cer
tified by the civil service.
The defendants contended that tbe plaintiff
would not be Injured by the payment of these
salaries and that In any event he has an
adequate remedy at law by a suit against the
Auditor or Treasurer on their official bonds.
I think there ls no force in the point that tha
Auditor or Treasurer can be nuÂ»d on his offi
cial bond. That is not a remedy available to
the plaintiff; furthermore the same argument
was applicable In the cases cited where -the
remedy was allowed. A
It ls claimed that as tha classifications
the Civil Service Commission contains a cTTSi
of "deputies (Registrar's office),"- and there
were not enough names on that ltst to fill the
places In question, the Boexd of Election Com
missioners was not required to take names
from the lists of ordinary clerks. But it is
alleged that there were more than seven can
didates standing upon the eligible lists of the
Civil Service Commissioners in these two
classes who could and would have been certi
fied to the Board of Election Commissioners.
Under rule 20 adopted by th* Civil Service
Commissioners It rested with them to certify
names from either list.. If In Its opinion those
lists equally conform to the requirements of
the position to be filled, and It was not com
petent for the Election Commissioners to re
fuse names merely because the designation on
the eligible list did not agree with the title
which the Board of Election Commissioners
had given to the clerical assistants whom they
were authorized to employ.
The evidence introduced on the hearing of
the order to show reuse does not in any way
affect the views just expressed.
Superior Judge SIobs yesterday
granted a temporary injunction to pre
vent the payment of the salaries of
twenty-five or thirty deputy registrars
who were appointed by the Board of
Election Commissioners and have been
performing the duties' of their office.
This action was taken in the suit of
Frank J. Symmes, president of the
Merchants' Association, against Audit
or Baehr and Treasurer McDougald.
The court overruled Baehr's demurrer
and ordered that a temporary injunc
tion issue upon the plaintiff's provid
ing a bond in the sum of $1000.
Judge Sloss' ruling upholds the Civil
Service Commission. The wording of
the opinion is sufficiently strong to In
dicate that the present deputy regis
trars were illegally appointed and that
their successors must be named out of
the eligible lists of the Civil Servioe
Board.
Judge Sloss' opinion Is in port as fol
lows: /
and allowing 15 cents for improve
ments may- conflict with the proposed
increases.
.City Attorney Long advised the
board that all amendments to the
charter must be submitted to the elec
torate at a general or, special election
held at least forty days after the pub
lication for twenty days of the pro r
poaed amendment. ... ,
But not every appointment made by the
board would constitute the appointee an of
ficer. He might, by virtue of the charter
section under discussion, be either an officer,
agent or employe. Whether he fell within
one or another of these classes would depend
upon a consideration of the terms of his
employment, the/ nature of his duties, the
permanent or occasional character of his em
ployment, the method of compensation and
the various other criteria which go to de
termine whether a given employment Is or
l s not a public office.
- The application In the case at bar does not
disclose the terms of the resolution under
which the position formerly occupied by the
plaintiff was created, the nature of the duties,
or the amount or method of his compensation.
The application Itself, however, repeatedly de
scribes the Post of secretary as an "office,"
and as a pleading is to be construed most
strongly against the pleader It must be taken
upon this demurrer that the application shows
the plaintiff to be a public officer and there
fore not entitled to the relief sought.
â¢ It is possible, however, that- a full dis
closure of the circumstances attending the
appointment and employment of the plaintiff
would show that he was merely an asent or
employu of thÂ« boardÂ»and he should therefore
have an opportunity /o amend his application
in order to show these facts If possible.
The demurrer will accordingly be sustained,'
with leave to-- amend within ten days.
The cases J of Hartley, Green, Curtis and
It follows that so far as public officers In
the service of the city and county of San
Francisco are concerned, the provisions of the
civil service article of the charter to the
effect that they shall not be removable except
for cause, upon written charges and after an
opportunity to be heard (article 13, section
12), are in conflict with the constitution of the
State and void. This does' not, however, af
fect the validity of the provisions of the char
ter requiring the appointment of officers by
competitive examination, except in bo far
as such provisions may In part be open to
some other objection. The two features of the
civil service scheme enacted In the charter,
to wit: appointment by competitive examina
tion and tenure during good behavior, are not
so inseparably Interwoven that the Invalidity
of the attempted tenure Involves the defeat of
the "merit system" of appointment.
It becomes Important, therefore, to deter
mine whether or not Eraery was a publla of
ficer; for, if he was and held at the pleasure
of the defendant board, he is neither entitled
to be reinstated to the office from which, as
In alleged, they have sought to remove him,
nor, If he were so entitled, could he estab
lish his right in this form of proceeding. *
It Is not easy to determine what constitutes
a public office as distinguished from an em
ployment. The definitions of public office given
by various text writers and decisions vary. â¢
â¢ â¢ It would seem clear that any person
described In the charter to whom a definite
governmental function or duty Is entrusted at
a fixed salary and whose function Is designated
by some specific title is an officer. The
secretary of the Board of Health' does not
come within this class. He was appointed un
der the provision of article 10, section 5 of
the charter reading as follows: "The board
(of health) may appoint such officers, agents
and employes as may be necessary for the
proper and efficient carrying out and enforce
ment of the purposes and duties of the board,
and may fix their salaries and prescribe their
duties." The charter then does not Itself
create the office of secretary of the Board of
Health" it merely gives to the board the
power to appoint officers, agents and em
ployes. â¢ â¢ * '
APPLICATION INDEFINITE.
A law which merely directs that an officer
shall not be removed without just cause does
not "declare" the term of such officer within
tha meaning of the constitution, and he Is ac
cordingly . removable at the pleasure- oX tha
power appointing him.
CHARTER PROVISION VOID.
Each of these propositions rests upon tha
basis that the place or position occupied by
Emery was an "office" and that he was an
''officer." If the position in question was an
"employment." as distinguished from an
"office," the writ of mandate could properly
be used to: restore plaintiff to such position,
assuming that he was unlawfully 1 excluded
therefrom. And, If It was not an office, there
is nothing in the constitutional provision above
cited to prevent the plaintiff's tenure being
'during good behavior.
On the other hand. If Emery was an "offi
cer" he cannot resort to a writ of mandate
to restore him to the office to which he claims
to be entitled for the reason that the title
to public office will not be determined In man
damus proceedings, but only In quo warranto.
And again. If Emery held an offlco he held
It (despite the charter provision) at the pleas
ure of the board appointing him. This result
follows from the terms of the constitution
(article XX, eectlon 16) above referred to,
Â¦which ' provides that "when the term of any
officer or commissioner Is not provided for In
this constitution the term 'of such officer or
commissioner may bs declared by law, and If
not so declared euch officer or commissioner
shall hold his office as such officer or com
missioner during the pleasure, of the author
ity making the appointment; .but in no c&aa
sliall euch term exceed four years."
The attempt of James A. Emery to
Induce the Superior Court to reinstate
him as secretary of the Board of Health
got a setback yesterday In the ruling
of Judge Sloss, who sustained the de
murrer of the defendants, but gave
Emery leave to amend his complaint
within ten days. The cases of Drs.
Hartley, Green and Curtis, who were
appointed as sanitary inspectors, and
Wolfe, appointed to a position at the
County Hospital, all of whom werÂ« re
moved, were submitted at the same
time, and Judge Sloss' opinion applied
to each case.
The opinion of Sloss is important In
that it raises the question of distinc
tion between "office" and "employ
ment" In the public service, and inti
mates that the oitv charter is in con
flict with the State constituion in is at
tempt to make appointees of municipal
boards unremovable except for cause.
The substance of Judge Sloss' opinion
follows:
TWa la an application by Jumei A. Etaary
ror a writ of mandate to compel tha mem
ber* of the Board of Health of the City and
County of San Francisco to restore Mm to
tno position or office o< secretary of Uw Board
?om He& l th - ~ U ts *"Â«*Â«* to Â»t on March 29,
1901, the Civil Service Commission certified
to the Board of Health the name of the peti
tioner, wUo had theretofore taken and passed
the civil service examination, and that on the
same flay the board appointed him secretary;
that on January Â«, 1804. the defendants abol
ished tbe position of secretary and created a
new position under the name of depoty health
oftloer. to which they appointed one Louis
Levy.
It Is farther altered that the duties of
deputy health officer are similar to thÂ« duties
of secretary u.nÂ£ that the defendants. In abol
ishing the one position and creating the other,
acted !n bad faith.
The defendants arguÂ« that under the char
ter, they had the power to abolish thÂ« plain
tiff's office, or employment, and that, as this
power has been exercised. thÂ« plaintiff cannot
be restored to a position which no longer
exists. But. on the demurrer, tbe allegations
of the plaintiff as to the circumstances of the
abolition and Its purposes are to be taken as
admitted. It has been held In a number of
cases arising, under a civil service law similar
In its main provisions to that declared In tha
charter that, although tber* Is powÂ«r to
abolish a position, the courts wlU. neverthe
less, disregard a pretended abolition made in
bad faith and for the purpose of removing or
supplanting the oocuDant. Any other rule
would entirely destroy tha effect of thÂ© civil
service provisions of tha charter In so far as
they s?ek to protect the tenure of employes.
A more Berious objection to tha application
is raised by the contentions that mandamus
is not the proper remedy, and that the pro
vision of the charter giving the plaintiff the
right to hold his position until removed for
cause is In conflict with the constitution of
the State.
The amendment also provides that
each member of the Fire Department
shall have fifteen days' vacation each
year and four days off of twenty-four
hours each every month, thus
making a/ total of sixty-three
days' vacation in one year. The
increases will , , affect flf ty-nin^
captains at $30 per month, or
$1770; fifty-nine lieutenants at $25, or
$1475; thirty-seven engineers at $10,
or $370;,\flve hostlers at $15, or $75,
and 360 hosemen at $10, or $3600, a
total of $7290 monthly. The city will
have to meet the sixty-three days'
vacation, requiring an additional ex
penditure, which will bring the total
cost to $9000 or $10,000 monthly. The
fact that another amendment will be
submitted limiting the tax rate for
municipal expenditures to S5 cents
Captains, $120 to $150; lieutenants,
$100 to $125; engineers, $112 50 to
$122 50; hosemen, after two years'
service.. $100 to $110; hostlers, $60 to
$75.
The intention is to subordinate the
engineers to the lieutenants as regards
salaries and there is liable to be some
friction in this connection, as the en
gineers propose to petition for an
amendment to increase their salaries
to $140, as prevailed under the old
consolidation act.
Under the law when 15 per cent of
the electors petition for a charter
amendment it is mandatory on the
Board of Supervisors to submit it to
the people. The board, however, may
submit an alternative amendment and
in this particular may amend by fix
ing the salaries at some other figure
than petitioned for.
FIFTEEN DAYS' VACATION.
Petitions signed by some 12,300 qual
ified electors, requesting the Submis
sion of a charter amendment provid
ing for increases In the salaries of cer
tain members of the Fire Department
and the fixing of a regular vacation
therefor, were filed yesterday with the
Board of Supervisors. The petitions
were referred to the Charter Amend
ment Committee.
The Droposed amendment provides
for monthly increases in salaries as
follows:
Another amendment was adopted pro
viding that firemen's pensions shall be
not less than $35 per month. The
amendment will Increase the pensions
of five firemen from $22 50 to $35. and
of twelve others from $17 BO to $35.
City Attorney Long filed an opinion
that It is within the power of the board
to submit a charter amendment pro
viding that real estate belonging to
the School Department may be leased
for a term of fifty years on condition
that the improvements erected thereon
shall equal the appraised value of the
lot. The amendment, which was adopt
ed, also provides that the Improve
ments shall revert to the city at the
end of the leasehold.
On recommendation of the Cl-arter
Amendment Committee the board
adoptad Supervisor Hocks' proposed
amendment to the charter providing
that any reputable applicant who has
been refused a permit to sell liquor by
the Police Commissioners after a hear
ing may appeal to the Board of Super
visors, who shall have power to Issue a
license if it finds that the permit was
refused for no Just cause.
Another amendment was adopted re
pealing the section permitting the Tax
Collector to employ a special attorney
for the collection of delinquent taxes.
Still another amendm .t was intro
duced and referred to the Charter
Amendment and Finance Committee.
It provides that the limitation In sec
tion 13 of chapter 1, article 3, upon the
rate of taxation, shall not apply in
the case of the interest upon the claims
for materials furnished to and work
done for the city and upon unpaid
teachers' salaries, the payment of
which was authorized by a constitu
tional amendment and gives the Su
pervisors the right to levy a special
tax to pay ouch Interest.
MOKE PAT FOR FIREMEN.
"It is a matter of perfeot Indifference
to me," said Mayor Schmitz, who was
seen after the meeting,' "what action
has been taken by the Supervisors on
my vetoes. The charter provides that
all proposed charter amendments shall
be adopted by ordinances, and as such
must be sent to me for my approval or
disapproval. If the Board of Super
visors fails to vote on my vetoes within
thirty days the vetoes stand of them
selves. In the event that. any attempt
is made to submit the amendments
vetoed I shall notify the Election Com
mission not to place the propositions
on the official ballot."
' In all likelihood mandamus proceed
ings will be instituted to compel the
Election Commission to submit the
amendments. This course was Infor
mally discussed by some Supervisors,
but no definite plan was outlined.
The amendments numbered 3, 4, 5
and 6, together with the one modifying
the dollar limit of taxation so that 85
cents shall be used for municipal ex
penditures and 15 cents for public im
provements, which one the Mayor
/signed, were ordered to be published
for a period of twenty days.
The Charter Amendment Committee
reported that charter amendment No.
2 was Imperfect owing to a clerical er
ror, which omitted to state the chapter
and article of the charter designed to
be amended, and relative to the use of
the Income of any public utility. The
error was corrected' and the amend
ment was readopted.
. O1T1ER AMENDMENTS.
Supervisor d'Ancona, who presided at
yesterday's meeting of the Board of
Supervisors during the temporary ab
sence of the Mayor, ruled that the five
proposed charter amendments which
were vetoed by Mayor Schmitz were
not adopted in the form 'of ordinances
or resolutions, and were therefore not
subject to the approval of the city's
chief executive. The proposed amend
ments are designed to take away from
the Fire Commissioners the power to
award contracts and '- place It in the
handa of the Supervisors; to al
low progress payments on pub
lic contracts; to prescribe a dis
trict within which it is prohibited
to blast; to require the approval of tha
Supervisors of any permit Issued by
tha Board of Public Works for blast
ing operations, â¢ and to permit of tha
spending of any revenue from any pub
lic utility that may hereafter be ac
quired. ThÂ« vetoes were read by title
and were ordered to be placed on file,
there being no objection to that course.
D'Ancona did not explain the reason
for sending the amendments to the
Mayor In the first place, merely saying
that they had been sent by Clerk Fay,
and not by the board. .

more free â¢with her youth and beauty
to make another brilliant match if
she wished. However, instead of this
expected denouement, society received
another surprise when a few months

Again English law proved compliant;
the order was rescinded and the mat

were her motives in so speedily resum

it remain a mystery, for as before the
proceedings were secret, but it has
been maliciously suggested that it was
done to spite the Marquis, who too
openly rejoiced in his deliverance
from the incumbrance of a wife.
The Marquis of Anglesey's folly and

The Mexican Government has placed a ban upon the
importation of firearms at several of her most important
ports, the purpose of our southern neighbor being to
lessen the power of her malcontents to create dis
turbances and wage internecine war. Mexico may learn
to her cost that such paternalism, however well inten
tioned, may overreach itself and bring forth an evil
greater than that which threatens. It is far better to
fight a dissatisfied man armed with a gun than contend
with an assassin equipped with dynamite.-
The Democrats of Alanreda County are illustrating in
their interesting selves one of the amusing oddities of
modern American politics. The followers of Jefferson,
overwhelmingly outnumbered by Republicans in the
home of Governor Pardee and a host of other officials,
are approaching a breach of the peace in their violence
to wrest their organization from one another. If this
isn't love's labor lost the phrase means nothing. Fight
ing for the privilege of leading one's fellow citizens to
defeat surely is not an unmixed pleasure.
A merry war of responsibility is being waged by the
Coroner, the Police Courts and the Police Department
to determine who is to blame for thugism in this city.
While crimination and recrimination are at their height
in this timely and essentially public inquiry it might be
well for the contestants to put their heads together, ac
cept the viewpoint of the rest of us, and concern them
selves less with fixing blame-than with ridding San Fran
cisco of the most cowardly and desperate of offenders.
Science has practically exterminated the mosquito in
Honolulu, and the. triumph over many desperate and
highly contagious diseases is complete. If some man of
wisdom, patient and crafty enough, will follow up this

which is playing such sad havoc with the morals of Ha
waiian public officials, the happiness of our island fel
low citizens should be reasonably complete.

A breeze blows in at the window here.
with the music of wind-swept
leaves;
The patter of rain on a farmhouse roof
and a flash of the trickling eaves;
The glimpse of a long, long lane that
turns and winds among the trees;
The scent of clover and mint and thyme
and the buzz of humblebees;
A breeze blows in at the window here,
with the sickles' harvest tune.
The ripple and splash of a rock-bound
stream and and the light of a har
vest moon,
That filters away through the leaves and
boughs In a yellow filigree;
A breeze blows in at the window here
that is fraught with memory.
Here is the tower of a granite pile and
here is an endless wall
Of brick and stone, with the misty light
of the city over all.
Up from the street comes a ceaseless din,
and the rattle of wheels on stone.
But the breeze blows in at the window
here, with the scent of a rose, half
blown;
With the tinkle far of a schoolhouso bell
and. the cry of lads at play.
The murmuring chant of the forest deep
and the fields that stretch away
To the rising hills, where the moon is
hid. till the yellow flames arise
As the rays of a night-lamp swung for
us through the arch of star-gemmed
skies.
Here are the streets where the toilers
are, and the din of busy wheels,
But a breeze blows in at the window
here like a welcome thief,, and steals
The glow of the city streets away, and
the pulsing roar grows dim
In the melody of a church bell's chime
and the chant of an evening hymn.
The stony streets are turfy paths and
the city's din and roar
Is the far-off, note of the woodland wild
or the break of waves on shore.
When the free-winged winds from the
far hills blow, and the tears that
dim the eye
Are dewdrops on wood violets in the
cloistered dells that lie.
A breeze comes In at the window here.
like a soothing message blown
From the world of birds and trees and
flowers to the world of brick and
stone;
Cries out to the heart that is cased and
barred and bids it spread It3 wings
For a little while and wander back where
the sweet-voiced wild bird sings;
The tinseled glow of the city pales in
the light of the yellow moon
That filters down through the bows and
leaves, and the joy of the wild bird's
tune
Kings out in a song of welcome home;
while the city's roar grows dim
In the rhyme arid chime of the old
church bell and the note of an even
ing hymn!

IN the London Daily Chronicle of a recent issue
George Meredith, last of the great Victorian novel
ists and now an old man waiting for death, emerges
from the long silence of the sickroom to express him
self with characteristic vigor upon leading questions of
the day in England and in the broader world theater.*
Together with some .caustic comments upon the trend
of the church, the drift:of politics and the present aspect
of literature and joJr&>alism, the aged novelist has to
say concerning the^iritish army and British loyalty
much which must carry a barbed sting to the self-satis
fied military caste in the United Kingdom.
"All our battles are soldiers' battles," says Meredith,
"and our army will remain a chaos as long as it is con
trolled by a singularly unintellectual, ill-educated and
unbusinesslike class. The Salvation Army might teach
them a lesson, or our railway companies."
"The fear of death is the real cause of the English
objection to conscription," continues Meredith in eluci
dating the broader aspect of what seems to him the de
cadence of the military spirit. ''Men come to
me and say their trade would suffer, or they could not
spare two years from thein. apprenticeship. Their real
meaning is they are afraid of being called out and get
ting" shot "at. So they pay others to do the killing and
dying for them. As it is .80.000 Germans could march
through England from end to end."
That is right from the shoulder. It tells plain things
in a plain way, plainer even than Kipling has put them
in his poems to the glorification of Tommy Atkins.
Judging from editorial comment upon these utterances
the cap fits the British head so snugly that it binds
somewhat and galls not a little. With the enormous
debt for the years of fighting necessary to reduce the
Boers looming large before them, our .friends across
the pond believe that they see thus put boldly into print
what they have dared only to think since Spion Kop
and Colenso. "Is it true?" is not so universal a ques
tion as "How long has it been true?"
Being distinctly a military nation, Great Britain tole
rates open discussion of the inside operations of . its
army very little more gracefully than does Kaiser Wil
liam. To the masses there, as to the world outside, it
is only the occasional incident given publicity that may
point the wind. Very fresh in the minds of all Ed
ward's subjects are the recent investigations into the
conduct of the war in South Africa, which disclosed
some very ugly revelations of incompetency in high
places and even cowardice where cowardice should be
least expected. There followed the drastic measures of
army reorganization, and the incident was closed to pub
lic view.
George Meredith has spoken fearlessly and for the
good of the British. Such utterances should strike
home. Even though they come from an old ma,n and
one presumed by reason of his trade to be unpractical,
they ring of truth.
Sir Charles Brooke, the only English
man who can boast of being an Asiatic*
monarch and whose sovereignty over
the sultanate of Sarawak, in the Island
of Borneo, with its population of near &
million, is recognized by King Edward
as subject to British suzerainty, has
just issued a proclamation appointing
his eldest son and heir, Vyner ( Brooke,
to act as stadtholder and viceroy of
Sarawak. Sir Charles, who expressly
declares that he does not abdicate his
throne, explains that age and growing
Infirmities have led him to transfer the
task of administering the government
of his sultanate to his eldest son. who
bears the title of Rajah Muda, who
will henceforth be "entitled to use the
swallow-tail flag of the sovereign on

is timely. He finds that San Francisco is not by any

construction of school buildings as are New York, Phila

will use the great leverage of his official position to ad

perhaps more important than most others we might dis
cuss for civic pride.

missioned to make the law of the sea. The commander
of a piratical Russian cruiser has no such authority.
His Government has in effect condemned him by order
ing that no more merchant ships be sunk at sea. The
prize court has hastened to justify what was done by
fortifying it behind a so-called judicial finding. But its
decision will not command the respect of other nations.
It is known that the ship that was sunk had Ameri
can cargo aboard, consigned to Singapore, far away
from the war zone. It is known that no attempt was
made to separate the alleged contraband from the rest
of the cargo, but all was destroyed together. This was
a violation of the law of nations. Non-contraband cargo
under a neutral flag is exempt from seizure and de
struction, though there may be contraband in the same
bottom. Any other rule would place non-contraband
property, under a neutral flag, absolutely in the power
of a belligerent.' A Russian agent might ship some
contraband to an alleged consignee in Japan on every
Americap vessel that plies the Pacific, and make its
presence aboard the pretext for destroying the ship or
for the condemnation of the whole cargo. It is to defeat
just such craft that the wise rules of international law
have been established.
IT is announced with a flourish of the megaphone that
a Russian prize court at Vladivostok has condemned
the merchantman Knight Commander as a lawful
prize for carrying contraband, and the hope is expressed
that this closes the incident.
On the contrary, it opens the incident. Neither the
ship, nor its owners, nor the owners of its cargoj were
present at this ex parte adjudication. The question at
issue is the right of Russia to destroy the ship and
cargo by sinking her in midocean, thus destroying the
evidence in the case as well as. the property. To sink
first and condemn afterward is like hanging an accused
man first and trying him afterward. â¢: International law
recognizes no such right and sanctions no such pro
ceeding. The prize court at Vladivostok is not com-

look upon the bright side of an apparently dark situation.
A reduced income means a curtailed employment of un

of social conditions and environment 1
as the youth from the slums who goes
wrong. His upbringing was of :he very
worst sort to fit him for the responsi- ]
bilities of his position and teach him
something of the value of money. An '
only child, he was indulged in every
whim or fancy that money could grat- j
ify. Of healthy home training he had
hardly any. Religious influences were
equally lacking in his early life.
It was his craze for jewelry which
has been chiefly responsible for his
financial smash. As regards them he
is at least entitled to the crc-.it cf be
ing catholic in his tastes. Diamonds,
rubies, pearls, emeralds, sapphires,
turquoises â nearly all the precious ;
stones found in him a ready purchaser.
Cabled reports have already told fully
what a weird and wondrous collection
of them he has acquired. His object
appears to have been two-fold. He had
something of the magpie about himâ a
strange habit of hoarding these costly
trinkets and gegaws, which was shown
by the unexpected places in which they
have been found during the recent
search in Anglesey Castle made for
the benefit of his creditors. The other
and perhaps more.powerful motive was
a veritable mania for self-adornment,
which led him Into another strange set
of excessesâ the pursuit of a semi
theatrical career. He seems always to
have been attracted by the theater, but
at a certain point in his career he
seized upon this as a means of ex
hibiting his priceless jewels. The lit
tle theater in Anglesey Castle, with
which he replaced the ancient chapel
soon after succeeding to his estates,
was little more than a very expensive
Betting for the bejeweled Marquis. As
Pekoe In "Aladdin." the pantomime
â¢which he produced in 1902 in his bijou
theater, he stood forth literally ablaze
with gems. In the various scenes hÂ«
wore different costumes, but each of
them was similarly bedecked with
precious stones of the most costly de
scription. Many of the jewels which
originally cost, large sums are of no
possible use to any ordinary wearer
owing to the fantastic form in which
they have been designed at the request
of the Marquis for stage purposes.
Of this character is a chain twenty
feet long covered with 520 charms, of
various kinds, some of which are of
little intrinsic* value, while others
would be cheap at $500. It will ba
broken up to be sold, as nobody would
want to buy a chain of charms that
length. v ' '
The Marquis seems to have realized
in the last year or two that this weak
ness for Jewelry would be the ruin of
him if he did not resist it, and was
wont to go about attended by a body
guard of half a dozen men under the
command of his chief valet, who. were
specially Instructed to keep jewelers'
drummers at bay. But, despite all
these precautions, they contrived to
get at him with disastrous results to
his purse, for when confronted by a
brilliant gem he could no more.over
come the temptation to buy it thai a
confirmed dipsomaniac can refrain
from helping himself to a drink when
left alone with a bottle of brandy.
About two years after the famous
"emerald wedding" society learned
With astonishment that the Marchio-
TiesÂ» had applied to the courts to have
her marriage with the Marquis an
nulled. On what grounds was never
revealed, for the evidence was all
ehioness of Anglesey. As Americans ;
know, in one part of the Continent
the famous actor-peer and spend
thrift dandy is wondering how on
earth a young man who has been in
the habit of pending something likÂ»
a million dollars annually 15 to get
any fun out of life on the beggarly
$10,000 a year which his creditors
have allowed him. In another part
of the Continent, however, his beau
tiful wife is congratulating herself
that the aforementioned creditors
cannot touch the $50,000 a year
which the Marquis settled upon her !
eoon after their marriage. But the '.
Marchioness of Anglesey has no in
tention, I am told, of dividing with
her husband, now that her income Is
tenfold larger than his.
Since the creditors swooped down
upon him much has been written
cbout the eccentric career of the
Marquis, but little attention has been
paid to his marriage, which tun>d
out as disastrous as most of his other
ventures. * Besides being marveloubly
pretty the Marchioness of Anglesey
is famous for her abundant red hair,
which is of the kind that artist? and
poets rave over. She '.b a diught;r
of Sir George Chetwynd and that
dainty little woman wno In hfr
younger years was known as ilie
'pocket Venus" and who at the time
of her marriage to Sir George was
the widow of the last Marauis of
Hastings. Lillian Chetwyni inherited
her mother's -auty and from the
emart and rapid set In which she
moved she acquired the notion that
Cupid was played out and that the
right and proper thing to do with a
pretty face like hers was to marry
wealth and title. Independent of other
considerations, and make a brilliant
match.
The marriage was a failure almost
from the start. "The Ideal Husband"
was one of the plays staged later on
by the Marquis at Anglesey Castle
and ;the title role he regarded as one
of his greatest histrionic triumphs, but
In real life he fell far short of real
izing it. Before the honeymoon had
*vaned an open rupture occurred be
tween them. Both found the matri
raonia] fetters irksome. Although
the Marquis was proud of his wife's
beduty it did not render him indiffer
ent to the charms of other women.
And the Marchioness did not find her
"husband sufficiently diverting to make
Ker forego the pleasures of more con
genial society.
LILLIAN. MARCHIOXESS OF ANGLESEY. THS ENGLISH BEAUTY, WHO I
FOUND LIFE DULL WITH A MAN WHO SPENT A MILLION A TEAR I
ON RARE JEWELS FOR SELF- ADORNMENT.
THE vast population of Greater New York offers to
the student of philanthropy and the promoter of
reform every problem incident to the massing to
gether of millions of men of all sorts and con
ditions. The greatest of these, in the estimation of
numbers of good people, is the drink problem. The
population of New York is cosmopolitan. In it are the
set habits and inherited tendencies of all races and na
tionalities. It is desirable to bring them all to a'com
ir.on habit of self-restraint and sobriety.
It is a most complex task. The principles which ap
peal to one are of no value with another. They are
wary of each other. One nationality is antagonistic to
another. There are race and. national prejudices to be
considered, and he who seeks a common ground on
which all can meet in the practice of habits that foster
morality and conduce to good citizenship has before him
a task from which the stoutest-hearted and most en
thusiastic may well recoil in despair.
Bishop Potter seems lo have concluded to make a be
ginning by promoting a modification of the type of
drinking saloon. To that end he became the patron of
a new kind of drinking place, a sort of tavern." It is lo
cated to command the patronage of about the hardest
class in the city, the mixed laborers on the subway.
We are not advised of the nature or extent of the modi
fications, intended to be carried out in this establish
ment. They seem to have appealed to the Bishop as a
step forward toward a more pronounced reform, for he
took part in the opening and dedication of the place. As
a practical proposition he may have been wrong. The
leading of the place toward better things may have been
overestimated. Craft and greed of others may have de
ceived him. But in law and morals a man is entitled to
the credit that is in the quality of his motive, his inten
tion. In this view of it no reasonable man will doubt
the excellence of the Bishop's intentions, nor the purity
of his motive.
But this view does not appeal to his brethren in orders,
and he has been the subject of the most vigorous pulpit
criticism ever heard in the churches of this country. He.
has been called everything from a bartender to an under
study of Judas Iscariot. One intense preacher communi
cated to his flock the news that the devil laughed and
danced when the Bishop dedicated the saloon, and gave
immediate â orders to his engineers to stake out more
ground and begin selling lots for an addition to hell to
accommodate the immigration that is expected to follow
the Bishop's act.
The various lay people who control the temperance
organizations have returned the clerical lead, and join
the chorus of condemnation that beats discordantly
against the great churchman. Never before has there
been such a stir in the teetotal ranks. If the Bishop be
sensitive to that sort of attack he must get little sleep.
His reply has been brief and is free from the epithet and
invective that is pelting him like a broadside.
In the midst of the excitement and confusion two
lines of thought on the subject appear clearly defined.
The abuse of liquor is a conceded evil. The multiplica
tion of opportunity for that abuse is a contributing
evil that should be regulated' and in every way discour
aged. How to do this is the problem that has led the
Bishop into trouble. The two lines of thought on the
subject do not differ in their estimate of the evil. The
division appears when the remedy is discussed. The
Bishop and those who think with him, looking into the
psychology of the problem, believe that human nature
can be led when it cannot be driven. His opponents be
lieve that it should be driven and not led.
The whole prohibition movement in this country has
been based upon the policy of making men sober and
moral by force. To this end some States have prohibi
tion in their constitutions and others in their statutes.
In this way all men who can be controlled by force have
been restrained. But these prove to be a minority of
those whose self-control needs reinforcement. The ma
jority of those who abuse liquor have proved that they
cannot be driven. As far as they are concerned all that
has been done is labor wasted. Their destructive habits
have as strong a grip upon them as ever, and their re
form and control wait for some other way.
Bishop Potter, and those who think with him, con
cede the evil and want to lead and not drive men away
from it. It seems to many unimpassioned observers that
the philosophy of the case is with the leaders and not
the drivers. If the Bishop believed that the place he
indorsed was shorn of a single objectionable feature of
the ordinary saloon, his action is justified by his belief,
though he prove to be mistaken in the fact.
It is the army canteen question over again." If the
canteen were an improvement upon the outside dead
fall, if it minimized the abuse of liquor and took the
soldier away from the associated vices of the deadfall, it
.was a step forward. Army officers differ in their opinion
about it, but the balance of testimony is on the side of
the canteen.
Now, if the Bishop intended that same sort of step
forward out of the degrading tendencies and associated
vices of the low saloon of the type resorted to by those
who. would be led to patronize the new institution, he
has not deserved the obloquy that has been visited upon
him. No man is commissioned to report the proceed
ings in heaven or hell incident to this affair. That part
of the attack may as well be cut out and the question
treated in~the light of our every day knowledge of men.

This is accompanied by an affidavit
from John K. Brown himself. In which
the disgraced attorney admits having
neglected his duty and offers no ex
cuse. He deposes, that in the first part
of November, 1903, he received by mail
from Mrs. Shields copies of a transcript
of the 1 record In the case Â¦with a request
that he prepare and file a brief in the
United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals in this city. He admits that he
received from Mrs. Shields through her
husband, S. D. Shields, a lawyer at
Terre Haute, Ind., $200 for costs of
printing the brief and other expenses.
TheBe facts were laid before United
States Circuit Judge Morrow and
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday and a mot n was made to
recall the mandate of the court. The
Judges decided that as the Court of
Appeals had adjourned until next
month they had no power to rescind
any action of the court.
The drunkenness of Lawyer John K.
Brown of Seattle Is declared to be the
reason why the case of Martha H.
Shields vs. the Mogolllon Exploration
Company and others went by default.
No appearance before the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals hav
ing been made by Brown, who had
been employed by Mrs. Shields to at
tend to the case, the court dismissed
the appeal on August 1 and issued a
mandate to that effect.
Mrs. Shields has filed an affidavit in
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals declaring that John K. Brown,
during the time when he should have
been attending to her Buit, used in
toxicating liquors to suc^h an extent as
to render him incapable 'of doing busi
ness, and that Mrs. Shields, who re
sides In Nome, Alaska, was not aware
of that fact. She deposes that when
the time arrived for Brown to file a
brief on appeal Brown was "drunk and
Intoxicated and continued to be drunk
and intoxicated for some time there
after."

Carillo was released on $1000 bonds

opinion, but In view of Jordan's per

The arguments of the attorneys yes
terday were brief and Immediately
Judge Hunt decided the controversy.
Ho said that he believed that somÂ« of
the witnesses for the petitioner were
untruthful. He said that it had been
shown that at times the mother was
hot tempered and given to evil speech,
but that the only witness who testified
to her illicit relations with Bothe. a
man who lived at the same house and
was known to the Laughlin children
as "uncle," was unworthy of belief.
But whatever her relations had been,
said the court, they had ceased and it
had been shown that her child was
always well cared for and uncontami
nated. It had been shown, too, that
the mother worked daily at the wash
tub and that all her children were well
dressed- For these reasons Judge
Hunt "saw no reason to disturb the
custody of the child," and denied the
application.
Judge Hunt of the Superior Court
yesterday decided that Mrs. Kate
Laughlin was entitled to retain the
custody of her six-year-old daughter.

A few weeks ago Mrs. Clara Wag
ner, aunt of the child, applied to the
Probate Court for custody of the lit

Contest Over Custody of Six- Year-Old
Marguerite Laiuehlin Decided
in Superior Court,
A temporary injunction was granted
yesterday by Superior Judge Seawell
preventing the Hydraulic Mining
Company from selling 20,002 shares of
stock belonging to W. H. Orr on an as
sessment of 8 cents a share, aggre
gating $1600 16. Orr is the president
of the company and the discoverer and
locator of the nineteen claims which
the company owns in San Bernardino
County.
According to the complaint Orr is
a prospector and knows that the prop
erty in question contains a great
quantity of placer gold and that the
claims are worth more than $1,000,
000, "of which fact he has notified the
company." Orr further pleads that
he is a poor man and unable to pay
the assessment levied. Beyond this
pleading the prospector, discoverer,
locator and president of the company
alleges that he paid out $2900 in as
sessment work and improvements on
the claims and it was agreed that this
should ofr :t the assessment by the
company against his stock. The com
pany, he says, has not kept faith, and
this man of the pick, shovel and horn
spoon resents the breach of contract.
So in his suit to restrain the sale of
his stock he adds an additional claim
for $1200, the balance due for the
work he has performed in making the
prospective million-dollar property.
Locator of Claims Says They Are
Worth $1,000,000 and He May
Lose Interest.

"You must excuse my appearance.

Judgs Conian handed down a decision
of guilty in the case of Harry M. Burns,
John B. Murray and Andrew Polovitch,
accused of selling liquor near the Pre
sidio without a license. The defendants
pleaded that they did not sell intoxicat
ing liquor, but gave It gratuitously to
soldiers who purchased cigars from
them. The Judge pronounced the plea
too transparent. Sentence to-morrow.
"It must have been a darling scrap

Judge Cabanies dismissed a charge of

so evenly matched in fistic science and
strength that it was difficult to deter
mine which of them had given or re

Frank's black eyes were offset by Pat's

exclaimed. "On de 'casion erluded to

Alonzo Ashman, habitue of opium

druggist when he fell victim to the In
sidious poppy Juice, and that since his
loss of high estate he has procured a
precarious means of smoking by setting
up tenpins in bowling alleys.
"Iletter would it be for you, Alonzo,"
quoth his Honor Judge Cabaniss, "if
you were to substitute yourself for one

words, bowl you out of existence. Thir

Assistant District Attorney Harris

bowled out by his devotion to the pipe

bench another case was on.
Fourteen male vagrants, classified by
the police as "wlneroom bums," were
gathered up In Portsmouth square last
Saturday night, and Judge Conian sen
tenced them to terms of imprisonment
in accordance with their respective rec

It was the wont of the defendants to

man said that Mr. Blanchard made a
practice of representing himself as a
Jackie who had come from Mare Island

this representation obtained for him
monetary contributions from patriotic
citizens who desired to have him return

SARATOGA, N. Y., Aug. 8.âWater
boy's racing career Is about over. The
great Watercress colt, which was un
questionably champion of the mature
division In these parts last year, may
no longer be able to hold up his end.
His pitiful eifort in the Great Republic
stakes on, Saturday convinced "Jack"
Joyner that he is not what he used
to be and the North Carolina turfman
said to-day that It was pretty near
time to send Waterboy to "the farm.
By "the farm" Joyner means the El
mendorf stud in Kentucky, the great
Eastern breeding establishment of
James B. Haggin.

FAMOUS WATERBOY'S TURF
CAREER IS ABOUT ENDED
Stafford possesses a cultured mind
and is regarded aa conservative in his
viewB. He has the confidence of both
laborers and the employers of labor.
The duties of thf Commissioner are va
ried, and under recent enactments he
has power to Insist upon protection to
workmen from dangerous scaffolding
and otherwise to improve their condi
tions.
The salary is $3000 per year. Stafford
is employed by the Southern Pacific
Company, his run extending from Fres
no to Oakland. Ho has made the latter
city his home temporarily, his perma
nent place of residenca being Santa
Cruz.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 8.â Governor
Pardee to-day appointed W. V. Stafford
of Oakland to the position of Labor
Commissioner. Stafford is grand presi
dent of the Order of Railway Conduct
ors of the United States and has on
several occasions represented the State
organization in the national assembly.
He has also for several years served as
chairman of the grievance committee
for the Pacific division of his order.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
In a vote taken in the board of di
rectors at this time, or until the United
States has the majority of directors,
that it is entitled to by reason of its
stock ownership, there is a chance that
the transcontinental railways may suc
ceed in tying up the Panama Railway
with another contract. This danger
has been pointed but previously in The
Call. Already there is a claim in the
East, as indicated by special dispatches
from the correspondent of The Call at
Washington, that the Government "vv ill
not be In any position to take action
relating to the Panama Railway and
its contracts" untli April 1, 1905. Thera
Is no explanation concerning this state
ment.
If the Government's directors of ths
Panama Railway see no way to taka
action now, It is difficult to see how
the Government can fail to have a ma
jority of the board of directors of tha
Panama Railway in April. If notice of
a termination of the contract between
the Panama Railway Company and the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company is then
given, six months would bring about
the expiration of the trade-restraining
agreement on October 1. 1903, or a llttla
more than a year from to-day.
DANGER IX SIGHT.
In any ordinary corporation when a
new interest secures control or owner
ship of a majority of the stock one of
the first steps after such change of
control or ownership is to call a meet
ing of the stockholders and elect a set
of directors to administer the property
In accordance with the wishes of the
stock majority. The singularity of tha
present situation in regard to the Pan
ama Railway is that one-seventieth of
the stock of the company is represented
by ten directors and sixty-nine-seven
tieths are represented by only three di
rectors.
In a previous dispatch from Wash
ington the fact was mentioned that tha
original contract between the Panama
Railway Company and the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company was dated June II,
1902, and that It was to continue in
force three years, but that it might
continue for two years more If either
party should so elect. This would maka
the possible date of expiration June 11.
1307.
ORJGIXAIi CONTRACT.
A special dispach from ths corre
spondent of The Call at Washington.
D. C, brings information on authority
that the contract between the Panama
Railway Company and the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company continues in forca
until June 11, 1907. There is. however,
a supplemental agreement that provides
that the contract may terminate upon
six months' notice by either party la
the event that the United States be
comes the owner of a majority of the
shares of the railway company. Tha
United States now owns sixty-nine
seventieths of the shares of the Pan
ama Railway Company. Taking thesa
statements together, It appears that
the United States can terminate In six
months from date the contract that ties
the Panama Railway up with tho In
terests of the Pacific Mall Steamship
Company, which Is another Vray of de
scribing the arrangement made by thÂ»
transcontinental roads for their own
purposes and in restraint of trade.

Quality of Eggs Questioned.
The Hearing of the suit of A. L.
Lundy & Co., produceNlealers, against
the managers of the Napa State Hos
pital to prevent the awarding of a
contract to Wheaton, Harrold & Pond
for supplying butter and eggs to the
insane asylum for the ensuing year
was commenced yesterday in Judge
Seawell's court. It was charged that
Lundy & Co. were the lowest bidders
for the .supplies, but that the contract
had been arbitrarily awarded to the
other firm. The evidence as far as
taken yesterday did not prove the in
ability of the Lundy company to ful
fill the contract in accordance with
the bid. but on the cross-examination
the prosecution brought out the fact
that the Lundy concern had received
several letters of protest regarding
the quality of Its supplies. The hear
ing will be resumed this morning.

Schorr's Ananias, after being nearly
backed off! the boards, won the River
side selling stakes, the third and fea
ture event of the Harlem card to-day,
which was worth J2260 to the win
ner. Sweetie was second, after mak
ing a sensational stretch run, while.
Golden Mineral- was third, a head in
front of Dell Leath. Spencerlan was
the only other starter.
Ananias was easily the best The
field of five ran 'closely bunched for
six furlongs, with Dell Leath and
Ananias heads apart. At the far turn
the favorite went to the front with a
lead of a length tnd a half. He
skinned the rail turning for home,
while the others swung wide. Nothing
ever got near Ananias . thereafter.
I Ananias opened at 6 to, 6 and was
pounded down to 7 to 10 at buffto call.
The stewards of the Harlem Jockey
Club have concluded that Jockey C
Bell was probably responsible for the
defeat of "Lucky" Baldwin's Capitan
azo when at a short price last week
and on account of the sudden Im
provement of the colt lp the first race
to-day they suspended, the Jockey In
definitely, pending further investiga
tion.
The track was fast, the weather
Ideal and the crowd larger thai* usual
on a Monday. A good card of seven

The only stake of the day was the

field, of which Gay Boy was the favor
ite, but the winner proved to be Aecen
sion, which Hildebrand had as his sec
ond winning mount of the meeting, hia
first being Rose of Dawn In the* third
race. To the surprise of all who have
seen Ascension run before, that mare
was eo full of speed that ail around the
far turn she was under a pull, Hilde
brand not being able or desir
ous of going to the front till the
stretch was reached. Once in the
straight Ascension drew away, but
nearing the finish Hildebrand allowed
her to run without urging, and she eas
ily won front Old England, which had
made all the running after galloping
nearly a furlong in one break. The
third horse was De Reszke, whose per
formance indicated that he will be hard
to beat in a mile race. Gay Boy was
forced to run wide and was somewhat
hampered by De Reszke,
In the third race Rose of Dawn, one
of the most truly proportioned fillies in
this country, outlooked her competitors,
but was said to be a trifle short of
work and was not as freely supported
as her looks warranted. She won clev
erly, with the poorhy handled Teacress
second, Lyne's riding of this filly being
much criticized. Summary:

that they have printed falls short of the truth.
In Europe, the life of the worker is h?ld too

It is believed that the fire was

The racking-house strike Is the greatest edu

workers are realizing that they are In reality
a part of the grf.it .socialist movement. The
harsh treatment meted out to the strikers by
the packers and'thc Inhuman conditions under
which they are willing to have men ani women
live and work in their slaughter-houses havu
brought organised labor to the conclusion that

Miss Hilda Spong has the part of the
involved lady. She returns here as
beautiful as or.e gratefully remembers
her, and with a notable gain in viva
city. One feels a slight, hard strain
of newness in the work, but the ner
vousness of a first night may well an
swer for that.
Her Lady Verona Is otherwise a
charmingly sufficient conception, and
picturesquely luscious. The rest of the
cast is "notoriously" adequate, as Mrs.
Kr.apman would say. Perhaps the Pro
fessor Tofield of Walter Allen, with its
delicious Ibsen make-up and sledge
hammer realism, springs first to the
pen. This seems unfair again to the
admirable injured husband of John
Glendenning. a capital, sympathetic
and. excellently dienified portrait. Then
thr-re is Stanley Dark's Pjecroft. nota
ble again. J. Hartley Manners excel
lence itself as Gerald Fanmere. Freder
ick Tiden's clever Tavender, Miss Bus
ley's pert mischief as Mrs. Tavender,
Bertram Harrison and Maggie Fisher
as Mr. and Mrs. Knapman â but there
is no fear of your missing them. Play
and players are of the battering ram
order of success.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
True, as one of Joseph's friends says,
he "would not trust his grandmother
with Joe Lacy." It happens, however,
that in the particular Instance Joseph
is innocent. As Joseph, Mr. Miller has
one of his most grateful opportunities.
He is all that the part demands â the
suave man of the world, the chivalrous
lover of the lady, the most eminently
be-badpr>red friend. One rolls the scene
under ore's tongue where he repeat?,
to his disbelieving chums, including an
uncle who has made "it his duty for
years to speak nothing: but the whole
truth." his in truth fishily sounding
story. It is throughout to say a whole
hearted "thank you" to actor and stage
manager.
It is delightful to find Henry Miller
again where Henry Milier should be, in
a part that fits him to a birthmark and
as the stace manager par excellence.
Admirable in mas?, the whole perform
ance teni'Us one to dally with its per
fect detail. Lack of space alone pre
vents a dithyrambic orgy on this, from
the Regent street toast rack to the
doors that shut. Perhaps to say that
every member of the cast â a large one â
Is as real as these is to say only the
truthful most of them.
Ah. and what brilliant material the
dramatist has given to them! The motif
of. the play is the depl^able readiness
of your best friend to "believe the
worst"â as they say at the Centralâ of
you â the snowball growth of scandal.
The motif has been tragically used be
fore by Echegaray. you remember, in
"E! Gran Galeoto." Jones lightens it,
and in a play admirably logical, un
hackneyed and invariably entertain
ing tells the story of the innocent Jo
seph condemned by a jury of his best
friends.
A Miller performance at its most, a
Jones play at Henry Arthur's best, is
the record of last night's production of
â¢â¢Joseph Entangled," favored us by
Charles Frohman for its American pre
miere. Here at least was -no case of
"trying It on the dog"â not that Mr.
Miller has ever been given to testing
the local squeal. But the play's suc
cess seemed a foregone conclusion. I
cannot imagine even Mr. Stockwell,
who refused "A Texas Steer" at
$1000, being pessimistic about the en
tangled Joseph. And, though this Is
by no means saying everything, the
comedy is one of the current triumphs
of the London season. Last night at
the Columbia the verdict was enthu
siastically indorsed by the most grudg
ing sort of local premiere taster. If
Mr. Frohman will take our word for it
â granted the cast that he gave us in
play last nightâ he - will have the
ear of New -York with ""'Joseph En
tangled" for as long as he Wants it
next season.
Republican delegates elected in San
Frajicisco to-day will nominate six
candidates for the State Senate, one
â¢from each of the following Senatorial
districts: Seventefnth. Nineteenth.
Tiver.ty-ftm. Twenty-third. Twenty
fourth <to fill vacancy), and Twer.ty
fifth. The contest for Republican nom
ination in the Nineteenth District is
excix.r.z rr.orÂ«= than local interest. In
this district Richard J. Welch is at the
head of a ticket in opposition to the
organization. If his ticket wins he
will ?Â»t ThÂ« party nomination for the
Star* Ser.afÂ». It is predicted that E. I.
Wolfe in til* 5 Twer.ty-firFt, Cl^orgr B.
Kear.e in the Twenty-third. Phil Has
kir.s in the Twenty-fourth and J. H.
Nelcoa ;r. the Twenty-fifth will win.
In the Seventeenth Bernard L. Conlon
is an active candidate for Senatorial
honors.
twwn B. F. Rush of Suisun and F. W.
Devlin of Vallejo is engaging: more
than local attention. The prize at
Ftake is the Republican nomination for
State Senator.
The counties of Plumas. Sierra. N>
va<!a and Placer comprise the Third
Senatorial District. The Republican as
pirants for the St8te Senate are \V. B.
Lardner and F. M. Rutherford. An in
teresting- contest is in progress.
Â«\immittee forces, however, under the
leadership of Gavin McNab. ar<? well
organized in every Assembly district.
ThÂ»? Republicans will poll the aver
aw primary vote to-day. As there
v.-ill b<? n<Â» ?'Xi-iiing contests in other
than the Thirty-second. Thirty-nfth,
Thirty-sixth ard Thirty-ninth districts,
a very largre vote will not be polled.
The name of Fred Ilawts. candidate
for State convention in the Twenty;
< isrhth District, has been incorrectly
published a? Fred Harris.
in the Thirty-ninth District the reg
ular Republican ticket is headed by T.
E. Atkinson for delegate to State con
vention. F. E. Maestretti heads the
low'al ticket in the same district.
Delegates to the nominating conven
tions of the several political parties will
he chosen to-day in twelve of the cities
â¢>f thÂ» State and throughout thÂ» coun
ty of Santa Clara. The twelve cities are:
San Francisco. Los Angeles. Oakland,
Diega. Pasadena. Alatr.cda. Berke
ley. San Jose. Sacramento, Stockton,
Fresno and Vallejo.
Th* 1 political storm center to-day is
fn IxÂ»s An ire! ess, where the forces of
Bard. Oxnard and Flint are flsrhting
for the control of the conventions that
wtH nominate legislative \ candidates.
The contest is so animated in the chief
city of the south that rcany Democrats

There is a close fight in the Republi

Senatorsbip. The principals in the con

There will be quite an exodus of dope
Sends from the Forty-fourth district
early in the day. It is said that one
of the Mission districts will be the ob
jective point cf the expedition.
Both factions of the party seem to
be confident of victory. The greater
activity was shown last night at
O'Briens Horse and Cart headquar
len in the Grand Hotel The County
Tlie County Committee force* and
the Horse and Cart followers of the
Democratic party of this city will meet
la battle array at the primary pools
iLÂ»-day. Close fighting is predicted in
ihe Twenty-eighth, Thirty-seventh and
Fnrty-fourth districts. Face smashing
in the Twenty-eighth was talked of
!::st night.
The Porte recognized the demand in
principle, but thus far has failed to
execute the necessary measures and
the American legation has now sent a
communication to the Porte pointedly
demanding a speedy and final settle
ment, the issuance of the necessary
orders and the official acknowledg
ment by Turkey of the American de
mands. There are no monetary claims.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 8.â Secretary
Hay to-day bluntly told Chekib Bey,
the Turkish Minister here, that the pa
tience of the American Government is
well-nigh exhausted. The Minister Is
expected to communicate this infor
mation to his home Government speed
ily.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Sunday, Aug.
7. â The. announcement of the dispatch
of the American European squadron
to Smyrna has perturbed the Porte and
will doubtless hasten the solution of
the question at issue betv.een the
United States and Turkey in a man
ner satisfactory to the former. The
Porte haj promised Ar..:rican Minister
Lieshman that a reply favorable to the
American demand for the same fa
vored treatment in the matter of
schools, hospitals and charitable Insti
tutions as Is accorded to other powers
would be given August 3. The giving
of the answer was' then postponed to
August 4, but up to the present time
no answer has been received.
NEW YORK, Aug. 8. â The Building
Trades Alliance, which comprises all
the unions affected by the big lockout
order, which went into effect to-day,
at a meeting this afternoon adopted a
resolution providing for the repudia
tion of the general arbitration plan
signed a year ago by representatives of
th*> Building Trades Employers' Asso
ciation and members of the Building
Trades Alliance.
5 In effect the resolution calls for the
complete denial on the part of the
unions of any arbitration plan or
plan binding them to employers. It
was stated at the conclusion of the
meeting that all the big Jobs in the
cfty would be struck to-morrow.
The number of men affected by the
lockout is variously estimated at from
50,000 to 100,000. About half of these
are skilled workmen.
CHICAGO, Aug. S.â Orders were is
sued to-day to drivers of Ice wagons to
deliver no more ice to butchers who
buy of the big packers or to any of the
branch houses of the packing plants
where the men are now on strjke.
PickÂ«ts will be stationed at the 200 re
tail markets that have been placed un
der the ban of the unions to see that
the boycott is enforced to the limit.
Additional police were ordered to re
port at the stockyards station to-mor-.
row morning to aid in protecting a
train from the East which is expected
to arrive with 700 strike-breakers, said
to include between 200 and 300 skilled
workmen.
Vice President Smith, who arrived in
the city to-day from San Francisco,
discussed with President Donnelly the
co-operative packing system now in ex
istence in Oakland, Cal., where he said
the butchers who were locked out some
months ago are in business for them
selves, with such success that the pack
ing companies are entreating them for
some J kind of settlement. Th^re. he
said, the operators of the rival indus
tries have the backing of the Pacific
Live Stock Growers' Association.

The steamer Francis H. Lcggett arrived
yesterday from Astoria, with a log raft in tow.
Fortunately for the safety of' coast shipping
fine weather was encountered and the raft
reached here 'Intact. In the raft are piles
measuring 10,000,000 feet of lumber. Any one
of these piles in a heavy sea could punch a
hole in the hull of the etoutest ship, and the
breaking up of one of these rafts would Im
peril hundreds of lives. The contents of the
)ox raft which > arrived yesterday would have
goaded to their full capacity a score of aver
age alze coasting vessels.

The liner Ventura on her outward voyage,
when between this port and Honolulu, passed
through a shower of squid, which delighted the
ship's cat and puzzled everybody else. Dr.
Clarke, the liner's surgeon, vouches for the
story, and volunteers the information that
the wingless. Unless piscatorial curiosities
must' bave . been lifted from the ocean in a
waterspout and traveled to the Ventura's deck
in a shower of rain. In proof of his story
he has two of the fish preserved in a botjle.
Professor J. E. Deuriden of Ann Arbor Uni
versity, who was a passenger, corroborated
Surgeon Clarke's diagnosis as to the family
the fish represented. They can Â¦ neither Jump

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
Shipping Merchants.
NEWS OF TIIK OCEAN.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Ventura arrived yesterday from
Honolulu and the Antipodes. She
brought 259 passengers and a small
but valuable cargo. The freight in
cluded 2342 ingots of copper. 441 in
gots of tin and forty boxes of British
sovereigns, valued at $1,000,000.
Among: the passengers from Ilono
lulu was a bevy of fair students re
turning from summer vacations to
Mills College. Another passenger
iras W. A. Bissell of the Santa Fe, |
who, with Mrs. Bissell, his son and I
some young friends, has been spend
ing a few weeks at the island port.
"W. A. Setchell, a botany Instructor at
Berkeley, was also a passenger on the
liner.
Among the passengers from Aus
tralia were some prominent mining
engineers. One of these, Thomas Pas
coe, is said to represent a London
syndicate which is one of the largest
operators in the world. William Todd
Weir is also a mining engineer, well
known on the African gold coast and
in New Zealand.
H. A. Wood, a coal passer on the j
Ventura, died from heat exhaustion on
the outward voyage. j
Pilot John Silovich brought the
Ventura in from sea and showed that '
a big steamer can be handled just as
easily as a towboat. He took the liner
alongside the Oceanic dock in a style
I that has been very rare since the days
when Captain Carey used to bring the
', Moana to the same wharf.

The market for new white Potatoes wai
quiet and weak at easier prices. Supplies
were far In excess of. the demand, as nearly
all* of Saturday's belated arrivals were still
on hand and fresh receipts were unusually
heavy. Sweet Potatoes from Coachella were
offering at 6c and a few small lots from Mer
ced sold at 3%c per pound. Onions continued
weak. -but prices were no lower.
. Fresh arrivals of Tomatoes were lighter than
usual and the best stock did a little better,
with occasional sales of small parcels reported
at 50c per box. Offerings of Lima Beans werÂ«
chiefly of poor quality and met with slow
sale at the previously quoted rates. The other
vegetables were In free supply and generally
weak. r

NEW YORK, Aug. 8.â Stocks proved un
able to withstand the effect of the snail wheat
market to-day, although therÂ« was sturdy
rcListance early. Danger of a rupture of the
steel billet pool and an open market for
finished steel products was another shadow
upon the market and its effect upon United
States Stct-i preferred gave it a strong sym
pathetic influence on the whole list. In face
of the flood of damage reports that poured
into Wall street from the Northwest and the
wheat market of tbe country and of the sen
sational jump in the price of wheat the early
firmness of the grain carriers gave way in
the latter part of the day under rather free
ofToringK. The influence of on? or two strong
spots in the 'trading had meantime passed
away. .Sugar rose with sustaining effect on
the list from the belief that a large fruit
crop would make a large demand from the
canning indurtriex. Metropolitan Street Rail
way's advance was due to the often revived
rumors of a combination with the inter
borough rapid transit. The cancellation of
the engagement of $2,500,000 gold for ship
ment to London was of some sentimental bene
fit. The weakness of the iron and steel
stocks was traceable to the accusation made
against the Republic Iron and Steel Company
of converting iron Into steel billets for the
Plttsburjr Steel Company at prices that made
thÂ» operation equivalent to a cut of $4 per
ton in the pool's price for steel billets. Re
ports of special meetings of the steel pool to
be held this week to consider the situation and
aReertions that disruption of the pools and an
ni-cn market for steel products" would result
brought a pressure upon United States Steel
preferred which cost It almost a. loss of 1%
pointB. Weekly traffic reviews by railroad
official* were of a favorable and hopeful tenor
and the later recovery In the stock market
reflected a cheerful undertone In the specula
tion. The closing.' however, was heavy.
â¢ Bonds were irregular. Total sales, par Â¦
value, f 2.223.O00. . â¢
United State* i.< rvin were unchanged on- call.

CHICAGO. Aug. 6.â Nothing quite so radi
cal as to-day'E sharp rise In values following
the continued advance last week has . been
witnessed in the wheat r>it for a long time.
According, to private dispatches the whole
Northwest has apparently been more or 'less
affected' by the deadly rust. Reports indicate
losa of thft entire crop, while the percentage of
damage in field alter field was described as
extremely heavy. S?ntember. wheat, which
opened strong with a gain of %@Aic to %@%c,
at 97%c to Â»7Â«ic,. went to $1 00% in succes
sion of leaps with but momentary pauses when
hclders. satisfied with their profits, realized.
Many such sellers, however, and bears In the
pit who have been' scoffing at the increasing
advices of rust encroachments were soon in
big rush for- grain, and carried the price of
September to $1 01%. There were bearish
features In the foreign markets, and statistics
show-id the world's shipments to exceed esti
mates by over 1,000,000 bushels, . but such
news was overlooked In the general fright
that appeared to possess traders. _ Realizing
sales 011 a laree scale, toward thÂ» close,
checked, the advance temporarily and caused a
reaction to 0!>*'.c. bÂ«t final figures showed the
buying craze on arain in nearly full force,
September closing strong at $1 01.
Corn was Krons, chiefly owing to the In
fluence of wheatl September opened V t c to %c
up at r>2*^c 10 52%c and advanced to 53%c
before being checked by Â».*llins orders. Induced
by reports ot excellent progress of the crop
in some sections. The close was at a recession
from thÂ» hish point, but the tone was firm.

BARLEY â In spite of heavy receipts of over
20.0CO ctls.both cash grain and futures were
higher, with a number of large sales In thf
sample market. The strength In futures was
due- to the general feeling of bullishness, heavy
buying In the Interior, and the tUing tendency
in Oats, which have now got so high that
Barley is being taken for feed in preference.

WHEATâ The foreign markets were quiet
and rather easy. The world's shipments for
the week were as follows. In quarters: Rus
sian. 184,000; Danublan. 51,000; Argentine,
156.000; Indian. 183.0C0; Australian. 69.0CO.
Chicago ran. from 97 Â«c up to $1 01% on
continued bad crop reports, though the North
west, which bought heavily last week, turned
squarely around and nold on the swell. Snow
issued a very bullish report. .Â¦
The Chicago letter of R. Brent Mitchell said:
"If was a broad, active market and closed
very nervous at' the top prices of the day. Tho
element of strength was the increasing reports
of damage to the. new _ spring _. WJieat crop.
These seemed to. be steadily covering" larger
territory and the percentage of* loss as esti
mated in current reports continues to increase.
There were some reports of frost, -but we are
inclined to think this was a minor influence
and unimportant. The New -York markets led
the advance and the other markets followed.
Foreign markets were about unchanged. We
do not like to get sensational and there is
also, of course, a great rendency to exaggera
tion in these times. â¢ The situation, however,
seems an unusual and critical one. .After so
great an advance it is a foregone conclusion,
that much nervousness will result, but on the
present outlook and present tendency of news
from the' Northwest we can only advise buy-
Ing 1 Wheat on sharp breaks."
- In this market futures \advanced 2c on the
.morning session, though the market did not
fully respond to the Chicago advance, and
sales were, not heavy.. The cash grain was
quiet, with buyers indifferent.

The week opened .with Butter firm snd well
cleaned up as far as the finest creameries were
concerned, with some houses quoting over the
top price below. There is a disposition among
some firms to get the market up hlghÂ«r than
the conditions warrant In order that it will
then break and drop back to where they con
elder It ought to be. These dealers are rush-
In? the . Quotations up for all- they are worth
and are trying to force the more conservative
houses to follow them. It appears, however,
that the public are going to have something
to say about the price of Butter before long.
Already several "large retailers report that thÂ«
people at large are leaving the high-priced
creameries and lookins: about for something
cheaper. In the meantime Eastern Butter Is

cluding State officials, owners of inun
dated lands, engineers, mining men and
commercial men, will then be called
upon to suggest ways and means to
improve the situation.
After hearing these witnesses the
board, accompanied by many prom
inent men, will inspect the conditions
as they exist. A river steamer will be
chartered for the purpose, and It Is the
opinion at this time that tWe trip will
extend over a week or more. Every
bend, shallow and broken levee will be
shown the commission.
nings the members of the board said
they believed the meetings here, which
will extend over a period of perhaps
two weeks, should be open, and that
every one interested in the problem
should have an opportunity to express
his opinion and suggest a remedy.

Hotel. Mr. Nurse is expected down
from Sacramento to-morrow. Lieuten
ant Colonel Heuer is permanently sta

HAVE COMBATED FLOODS.
Major Dabney and Mr. Richardson
have won their eminent positions in
the engineering world in successful
i combats with the floods of the Mis
sissippi River and many of the perma
i nent works that hold back these rush
| ing waters from cities and plantations
are the result of their engineering skill.
' Mr. Chittenden has had great experi
ence in problems similar to that that
now faces him, -the treacherous Kaw
River having been studied by him and
partly controlled through his , efforts.
Mr. Nurse's experiences with the floods
of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
basins, together with the fact that he
is the State Engineer, resulted in his
appointment on the commission.
Rufus P. Jennings, manager of the
California Promotion Committee and
chairman of the River Improvement
and Drainage Association, conferred
with the Eastern engineers yesterday
in order to ascertain their desires be
fore proceeding with the preparation of
their itinerary while here. To Mr. Jen-
fcpeakfn* for Senator Galllniffr and his asso
ciates of the Merchant Marine Commission, I
wish very earnestly to thank the Chamber of
Commerce for its kindly reception of the com
mission and for Its unremitting- efforts to make
the sessions here so thoroughly successful and
representative as they have been.
The hospitality of President Newhall and
your own prompt attention, anticipating every
possible need of the commission, will especial
ly be long: remembered by the Commissioners.
In no city of the country has a more Intelli
gent and widespread Interest in the merchant
marine been manifest, and the testimony gath
ered here, the Commissioners believe, throws
pome new and clear light upon this eerious
problem of the upbuilding of our ocean fleet.
The members of the Merchant Ma
rine Commission have expressed their
gratitude for the hospitality' extended
them in this city. The following let
ter was received yesterday by Secre
tary Scott of the Chamber of Com
merce from Secretary Marvin of the
commission:
Members of Merchant Marine Com
mission Express Gratitude for Hos
pitality Extended Them Here.

When the trains reached here yester
day afternoon the majority of the pas
pengers were in an ugly mood. An
griest of all were the young women,
â¢who had Fuffered from the cold of the
mountains and who looked anything
but happy !n their soiled and wrinkled
picnic dresses. All freely expressed
their indignation over the treatment
riven them by the railroad company.
The officials rea'ized the justification
Â«'f the indignation and ordered the case
thoroughly investigated. It was not
long before they decided that Superin
tendent Wilder had bepn extremely
negligent, as he might easily have dis
patched a special train from this city
early Sunday afternoon and brought
the picnicker? back to San Francisco
the same night.
In consequence, Wilder was censured
by his superiors and given to under
stand that the matter* is not yet
closed. It certainly is not. for to-day
the committee of Xative Sons, repre
senting Precita Drum Corps, is due at
the railroad office for a settlement of
the expense account and it is expected
that its members will have something
to say regarding the manner their
ruests were treated by Wilder's divis
ion.
The first section of the train, how
ever, had bare!y started on its return
trip to this city when the rails spread
and another blockade was effected. A
wrecking train was sent out from San
Jose to repair the track, but it proved
an all night job. It was well into the
forenoon of yesterday when the track
was cleared and the fatigued and hun
gry picnickers started homeward. Dur
ing the night, while the majority of the
passengers remained aboard their
trains, a gang of roughs, who attended
the picnic, stormed the only liquor
store at Wrights and filling themselves
with whisky proceeded to offer every
possible annoyance to the people in the
cars and many indignities to young
women.
Early Sunday morning three sections
of a big train, bound for Sunset Park,
where a picnic under the auspices of
the Precita Drum Corps was to be
held, left the city. Everything went
well with the excursionists until they
had nearly reached Wrights Station,
when the locomotive of the forward
section left the rails and the three
trains were stalled. The passengers,
realizing that it" would be hours be
fore the engine could be placed on the
track, walked to the pleasure grounds,
a distance of six miles, and after a
half-day of merriment had all but for-
Kotten the inconvenience they had suf
fered in the morning. They walked
back to their trains at dusk, only to
discover that the engine had not been
enrailed. and were forced to await pa
tiently the achievement of this task,
which was accomplished about 8 o'clock
in The evening.
Three trainloads of picnickers, home
ward bound frcm Sunset Park in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, spent the
greater part of Sunday night and
Monday morning at Wrights Station,
huddled up in the chilly cars. When
they finally reached this city, about
2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, they
were the saddest and most dejected
lot of merry-makers that ever under
took an outing. The trouble was due
Uf an accident, but the railroad officials
have found occasion to severely cen
sure Superintendent Wilder for his ap
parent neglect in failing to send a res
cue train to the pent-up passengers,
who, for over eighteen hours, suffered
unnecessary hardships from lack of
comfortable quarters and much needed
food. i

General MacArthur, accompanied by
his aids and staff, left yesterday morn
ing at 8 o'clock for Camp Atascadero,
where he goes to witness the big bat
tle maneuvers which will be taken
part in by troops of the regular army
and State militia. The big exercises
begin Saturday, August 13, and will
last until August 27.
Colonel William M. Pitcher, with
his provisional regiment, composed of
men from the Tenth, Thirteenth and
Twenty-eighth infantries, with the
splendid band of the Twenty-eighth
Infantry, departed late yesterday
afternoon for Atascadero. Previous to
starting from the Presidio the troops
gave a fine parade, which was wit
nessed and applauded by a large num
ber of Spectators. The Fifteenth In
fantry, from Ord Barracks, left yes
terday for Camp Atascadero and by
neon to-day there will be nearly 3000
troops on the campgrounds.
Tha trial of Captain Frank A. Cook
came up before the court-rnartial at
the Presidio yesterday morning at 10
o'clock. olonel Charles Morris is
president of the board and Captain
John J. Baxdley is judge advocate.
The charges preferred against Captain
Cook are conduct unbecoming an of
ficer and a gentleman and that of
breaking a pledge to his commanding
officer that he would abstain from all
intoxicating liquors for three years
from March 3, 1903. Some half a
dozen witnesses were called before the
court yesterday to prove that they had
seen the exhibition which Captain
Cook made of himself in a resort on
the corner of O'Farrell street and
Grant avenue. The testimony offered
was practically all. on the same point.
It was to the effect that Captain Cook
had come into the resort in what ap
peared to be an intoxicated condition
and had so intruded his presence on
some patrons of the house that the
barkeeper was forced to eject him.
The result was a scrimmage on the
sidewalk, which wound up by Captain
Cook being arrested and taken to Jail,
where the next morning Judge Mogan
fined him $10 for disturbing the peace.
He sailed for Manila June 1, but
when the news of the rumpus reached
the ears of General MacArthur h<?
cabled to Honolulu and ordered Cook
back to San Francisco. Captain Cook,
it is reported, did not deny in any way
the scrimmage that took place, but he
was endeavoring to prove that his ac
tions were not caused by the use of
intoxicants. It will be some time be
fore the^trial is concluded, as it will
probably*be necessary to bring several
mpre witnesses to testify.
The whole of Schussler's testimony
was calculated to show that a municipal
water system without a series of stor
age reservoirs could not be used as a
basis on which to estimate the value of
the Spring Valley "plant. The hearing
win be resumed this morning.
"very little water was gathered, and
had it not been for the precautions
taken by us the city would have been
without water. The results might have
been disastrous. It happened, however,
that the preceding years, from 1893 to
1897, were very good, and with our sys
tem we had stored sufficient water to
carry us over."
According to Schussler, Grunsky fol
lowed as closely as possible the system
of the Spring Valley Company, but a
service on the lines laid down by Grun
sky would be dangerous, because vast
storage reservoirs are needed to tide
over the years of light rainfall. The
rapid increase of the population of the
city is also an important item.
The testimony given by Schussler was
largely a comparison of the system laid
out by Grunsky and that of the Spring
Valley Company, his object being to
show that a comparative value could
not be based on the water works
planned by Grunsky and made to apply
to the system of the Spring Valley
Company. The city's demand for water,
he said, has increased beyond expecta
tion, but owing to the precautions
taken by the Spring Valley Company
its residents have not suffered in yeara
of drought.
A map showing the annual rainfall
for some years was presented. It also
showed how much water had been
stored each year. The witness explained
variations in the rainfall and storage
by saying that after a dry year the
ground' would be so parched that a suc
ceeding wet year would not give the re
sults a layman might expect. The in
creased consumption of water for irri
gation purposes also reduced the sup
ply. As an instance of this Schussler's
figures showed that in April, 1894, the
reservoirs contained 24.000,000,000 gal
lons of water, while in February. 1904,
they contained but 10,000.000,000 gallons.
This falling oft was explained by in
creased Tnsumption, dry years and
evaporation.
"From 1897 to 1903." said the witness.
Herman. Schussler, chief engineer for
the Spring Valley Water Works, occu
pied the witness stand yesterday in
Judge Heacock's court during the hear
ing of the suit to declare illegal the
water rate fixed by the Board of Super
visors. The questions were all asked on
direct examination by Attorney Kel
logg for the water company, and elic
ited chiefly a mass of figures regarding
the rainfall and the capacity of various
reservoirs. Maps showing the rainfall
from year to year were admitted in evi
dence, and Schussler also compared the
Spring Valley plant with the one prom
ised by former City Engineer Grunsky.
