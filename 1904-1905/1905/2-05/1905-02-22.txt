Speech From Throne.
BRITISH STATESMAN WHO IS RECEIVING PROMINENT MENTION AS THE
POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR OF PREMIER BALFOUR WHEN THE LATTER' S
MINISTRY IS COMPELLED TO LAY DOWN THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT
LONDON, Feb. 21.â John Redmond's
amendment to the address in reply to
the speech from the throne was de
feated in the House of Commons to
night by a vote of 286 to 236, after an
exhaustive debate occupying two days
and affording an opportunity to repre
sentatives of the several parties and
factions to express their views on the
Irish situation. The amendment de
clared, in effect, that the "political
system of government (of Ireland) is
opposed to the will of the Irish people."
The net result of the debate showed
that all agreed that the present sys
tem of government of Ireland was un
satisfactory, but that there was not a
distinct agreement concerning methods
by which the dissent may be stated.
At the opening of the session to-day
John Dillon and Timothy Hoaly pup

story of Mr. Roosevelt:
The President so enjoyed his box

obtained leave of absence from the
Athletic Club and went to Washing

President, and after it was over Mr.
Roosevelt invited "Mike" to attend
the reception to be given the army
and navy that evening.
"Mike" replied that he had no suit
able clothing. The President laughed
and sent for several of his own suits.
They were all too biff for "MikP." but,
seeing that the President wanted him

Kenyon-Slaney referred to the claim of
Irish-Americans that they had killed

Healy. replying on this point, said:
"God bless the Irish in America.
They are faithful to their country, re
gardful of its interests and are deter
mined that if you make a treaty of
peace with the United States it shall
be abiding and lasting."
Healy bitterly assailed, the Ulster

the Conservative party to concede the
wishes of the Nationalists in the in

Karl Spencer, in the course of a
speech in London last night, referred
to rumors that he would be the next

he would accept such a responsible po

Chicago Barber Asks Health Depart

Hospital.
CHICAGO, Feb. 21.â Many persons
have tried to get out of the isolation
hospital, but until to-day there was
no record of any one attempting to
break in. Hence the surprise of the
Health Department to-day when a
man, apparently sane, asked to be sent
to the place where smallpox patients
are kept. The man was John Adams,
a barber.
'I have a disease of the skin," he
said, "and I can't get rid of it. A
physician told me- if I could get
smallpox it would cure me, and I want
to try."
"You go down and live in a tene
ment on South Clark street, and if
you can't get smallpox there you
can't in the hospital," said the secre
tary. Then the visitor went away.
"Th^re is a general idea that small
pox will cure all blood diseases," reÂ»
marked Dr. Spalding. "It will cure
some, but not psoriasis, which that
man has."

Jury Fails to Agree on a
Verdict and Is
Locked *Up.
Rumor Says Only One Man Stands
Between Auburn Youth and
the Gallows
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Feb. 21.â A1l that stands
belween Adolph Weber and the gal
lows, according to a rumor afloat here
to-night, is the opinion of one man.
Eleven of the twelve men chosen to
decide the fate of the Auburn boy who
for the last twenty-seven days has been
on trial on a charge of murdering his
mother, rumor has it, are satisfied
of his guilt. The twelfth man is also
satisfied that Adolyh Weber is the
murderer, but he does not want the
youth hanged; he wants him impris
oned for life. If he sticks to this opin
ion, the Weber jury will have to an
nounce that it is unable to agree, and
a new trial will result.
The jury in the Weber case was
locked up at 11:30, it having failed to
arrive at a verdict after nearly seven
hours' deliberation. Bedding at this
hour was sent in to the twelve men
and they will not be heard from again
until eight o'clock to-morrow morning,
when Judge Prewett will open his
court. Whether the jurymen will de
liberate all night and arrive at a con
clusion before that time is a question.
Meanwhile Adolph Weber is stretched
out on his cot in his narrow cell vainly
wooing Morpheus. Sleep refuses to
come to him, however, and it is more
than probable that he will not close an
eye until he hears from 'â¢"*â¢ men who
are to say Whether he stmu iive or die.
When the jury left the courtroom to
day Weber acted as If their going was
but a part of his every-day life. He
displayed no Interest, even when his
attorney objected to the jury being
placed in the charge of Under Sheriff
May. It was different, however, an
hour after they had gone into the big
room, where they were to decide his
fate. Then Weber began to show signs
of the terrible strain. In the court
room in the presence of the crowd of
curious, he had managed to control
his feelings. But his wonderful nerve
was not proof against the loneliness of
his prison cell. Vainly he tried to sit
still. A dozen times at least he paced
his cell, finally throwing himself face
downward upon his cot, where he re
mained but a few minutes when he
arose and again began the walk up and
down the length of the narrow room.
Hour after hour this continued,
and when a few minutes before mid
night he was informed that the jury
had not reached a verdict, he threw
himself upon the cot and mumbled
that he wished to be let alone.
It was after 5 o'clock when Judge
Prewett finished his charge to the
jury. The major portion of the day
was taken up by Attorney General
Webb in answering the final argu
ments of the defense. He said in clos
ing:
"It is a sad matter to find a fellow
man guilty of murder, but crime must
be restrained. This crime was a dark
and damnable one, and the terrible
deed was committed by the defendant.
Adolph Weber. Bring in the verdict
In accordance with the facts that have
been presented to you. Bring in the
verdict as jurymen. You are not
only responsible to yourselves, but you
are responsible to God for your ac
tion."
When Judge Prewett directed
Under Sheriff May to take charge of
the jury one of Weber's attorneys ob
jected. He declared that he would
not give his consent to such a pro
ceeding. He made his protest so
strong that Judge Prewett dismissed
May and turned the jury over to the
care of another officer of the court,
instructing that official that if the
jury had not reached a verdict by
11:30 he was to lock the twelve men
up for the night.

NEW .YORK, Feb. 21. â Mrs. Han

money and the house, said to be valued
at $685,000, which were given to her
by John R. Platt, the millionaire oc
togenarian. Judge O'Gorman in the
Supreme Court to-day handed down a
decision which gives the negress a
complete victory and disposes of the
contention that she obtained the prop
erty which her venerable admirer lav
ished upon her through extortion,
blackmail or fraud. Platt at the
solicitation of his relatives sued Mrs.
Elias to recover the amounts which
he had given to her.

IN A LARGE

Workman Is Nearly
Suffocated by Mud
and Slime.
Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
CORONA, Feb. 21. â Crouching In
mur and slime to his lips, tangled in
a network of roots and unable to
move, was the predicament in which
Fred Laughlin found himself this
afternoon while working in a twenty
eight inch underground pipe. He was
within a hair's breadth of perishing.
Laughlin is one of a gang of men
employed in cleaning out the Temes
cal Water Company's lower pipe line.
Walnut roots had worked their way
through a series of cracks into the
pipe. With sediment and water, the
growth of the roots, some of which
were as thick as a man's arm, had
filled the pipe for about twenty feet.
Laughlin, when about 400 feet from
the manhole, discovered, to his hor
ror that he could neither move for
ward nor backward, but was a pris
oner in a close tangle.
Lusty calls explained the critical
situation to his fellow workers at the
manhole. After digging to the pipe
and breaking it a man was lowered,
who found there were about eight
feet of roots to be cut away before
Laughlin could be reached.

Proof of Guilt Is

Conclusive.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 21.â The fight
which the administration began to-day
against the big Western packers is ex
pected to terminate in Jail sentences
for some, if not all of them. Criminal
indictments are regarded as certain
and convictions in the trials that will
follow are almost aa confidently ex
pected.
The penalty for each violation of the
Sherman law is two years in the peni
tentiary and a $5000 fine, or both.
The evidence which District Attorney
Bethea has ready to submit to the
Grand Jury has been submitted to the
President, and, in detail, to Attorney
General Moody, in the course of sev
eral recent conferences. Both the
President and Moody believe that proof
of the packers' guilt is conclusive and
amply sufficient to insure convictions
in the most important cases, if not in
all of them.
With the summoning of a special
Grand Jury In Chicago tne reason for
Garfield's delay in sending the report
of his investigation to the President
for transmission to Congress became
apparent. Though the report has been
completed for some time, it has been
held back to prevent the packers ob
taining any advance information of
the evidence against them. It is now
probable that the report will not be
sent to the President until after Con
gress adjourns and then will be re
garded as confidential, as the trials
cannot come up before March 4. Evi
dence accumulated by Garfleld, or so
much of it as may be necessary .to se
cure indictments, will be presented to
the Grand Jury, but its exact nature
will not be divulged and the packers
will be in the dark as*to the extent of
the Government's case against them
until the cases are tried.

BILL APPORTIONING SCHOOL FUND

The light against the measure was

with McGowan holding the reins. The
fight just missed being seriously
personal. When they saw that
a vote would result in the
carrying of the measure, the San
Franciscans, backed by some of the
Alamedans. resorted to the strongest
filibustering tactics. At one stage of
the proceedings, when matters were at
a white heat, Ooghlan practically de
tied the Speaker of the House. It was
a beautiful scrap and will go down in
legislative history as one of those de

\MI \l>\||.\T MOVED.
McGowan moved an amendment that
the portion of the bill providing for the
apportionment on - basis of $250 per
teacher, be stricken out. This would
leave the law as it now stands.
A dozen Assemblymen were trying to
get the floor at once and there was a
commotion that almost drowned the
gavel. McGowan was still on his feel
when it subsided and received recog
nition. He asked *br fairness, cour
tesy â¢nd Justice. He called attention
t< the fact that San Francisco sup
plied all the amount she drew fr. in
the State school fund and $448,000 more.
With the loss of $215,000 under the
Slav, bill she would be behind a total
Â«â¢! nearly three-quarters of a million,
he said. He spoke of the "unholy al
liance" of the bill's proponents with
Los Anreles, by which the basis of ap-
I.'ortionment was rtduced to mi per
teacher, so as to secure the vote of
the delegation of that city. There was
Jot one behind the bill who was not
actuated by a selfish motive, he said.
McGowan's accusation of selfish mo
tives brought another bunch i f As
ymÂ«nt to their feet, all protest
ing at once. Drew of Fresno made a
speech th.it brought down upon him
the united wrath of the San Francisco
delegation. He said that if he had his
way he would not trive San Francisco
a dollar of school mone/, but would
take her children from the bad influ
ence of the streets and educate them
in the interior. McGowan took a whirl
at Drew and was followed by Atkin
son, who said the Fi esno man was
blurring the youth of San Francisco
without any right or any 'knowledge of
the subject. The Speaker's gavel was
broken during this rally.

The Speaker overlooked the remark,

not. It was announced that he had
taken a turn for the worse and that
he was fighting a hard battle for his
life. This afternoon he was operated
upon for appendicitis.
Wright, determined to get all of
the advantage he can out of the few
days' activity Lhat remain to him,
spoke this morning on behalf of his
bill for the relief of E. D. McCabe,
who asks for $3333 salary as Build
ing and Loan Commissioner he was
deprived of through the appointment
of a successor to his office before his
term legally expired. As all appre
ciated Wright's position no one raised
a voice against the bill and it passed.
The most important legislation be
fore the Senate this afternoon was
the railroad crossing bill. A protest
against the measure has gone up all
over the State, with the result that to
day Senator Pendleton. author of the
measure, offered an amendment he
believes will meet with general ap
proval. This amendment follows:
No railroad main track crossing, outside the
limits of any Incorporated town, city, or city
and county, shall be at grade, unless the party
proposing: such . crossing: at grade shall, at
Its own sole cost and expense, protect such
crossing by the construction, operation and
maintenance of an Interlocking plant, with
suitable signals and derails, but either party
to *uch crossing may Insist upon a separa
tion of grades, in which case the cost of
constructing such crossing with Separate grades
shall bu. equally divided between the railroad
companies concerned; and provided further that
where any crossing haÂ» been constructed at
grade, either company may, at any tim there
after, require a -separation of the grades at
â mil crosslns, each company paying one-half
of the expense of such separation; and pro
vided further that the foregoing provisions
shall not bo construed as requiring a separa
tion of grades where such' separation la physi
cally impracticable, and in case of 8-y dis
pute or controversy as to the physic; prac
ticability of any undergrade or .overhead cross
ing, the same shall be determined by the Su
perior Court of the county in which such cross
ing is situated in an action ' or proceeding
brought by either party f<Â»- that purpose.' ;.*
The amendment was adopted and the
bill ordered on the third reading file
for final passage.
Senator Welch's bill aimed to pre
vent the feeding of diseased animal
meat to poultry passed the Senate
without a dissenting voice.
Lukens' hill to authorize the mainte
nance of spur tracks in municipalities
was the subject of a lengthy debate
and was finally referred to the San
Francisco delegation for investigation.
Senator Welch said he was of opinion
that the bill would r>ermit of the con
struction by â¢ the Santa Fe of spur
tracks in the Potrero against which
the citizens of that district had pro
tested to the Board of Supervisors and
he wanted time to look into the mat
ter. ' Lukens denied that the bill was
intended to aid the Santa Fe.

JOURNALIST ?:XPLAIN'S.
Santa Cruz Editor Is Purged of Con-
tempi.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 21. â The As
sembly and Editor Smith of the Santa
Cruz Surf have smoked the pipe of
peace and the contempt incident is a
matter for the archives. The editor
has sent a communication to the
Speaker, which has been ordered
printed in the journal, explaining
that when he called members of the
Judge Smith investigating committee
"programmers" he understood the
political definition of the word "pro
grammer" to be a man who followed
the behest of the leaders of his party,
and that there was nothing disgrace
ful attached to being one of those ani
mals. McCartney, chairman of the
Smith committee, introduced a resolu
tion that further proceedings in the
matter be indefinitely postponed, and
It was adopted.

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 21. â The As

well practiced stunt of reversing itself.
It passed the Senate substitute for
Pyle's anti-compulsory vaccination
bill, after having defeated it last
week. There was another debate on
the measure. It had a close shave,
getting only one more than the neces
sary forty-one votes, and that only af
ter a call of the house.

KELLY GETS
READY HIS
SECURITIES
Boss Is Frightened
by Rumors of
'a Warrant
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 21.â Martin
Kelly is preparing for arrest which he
believes will come to-morrow. The old
time boss arrived here this evening
and was soon informed by his friends
that it was the intention of the District
Attorney to move against him at the
earliest* possible moment. Martfn im
mediately became busy searching for
bondsmen to secure his release in event
a warrant was served upon him. He
found two men that said they stood
ready to qualify, and then the man
that has thrust himself into the boodle
scandai rested easy.
At the Sheriff's office to-night it was
announced that Martin had been need
lessly alarmed. No warrant, said
Sheriff Reese, had been sworn out, nor
had the Grand Jury met to consider
his case. It may do so to-morrow,
however, he concluded, but it was
hardly probable in view of the holiday
which all officials want to enjoy.
"1 heard they wanted me," said
Kelly, "So I went down to the court
house with my bondsmen. It proved
a false alarm, however."
VETOES FIREMEN'S BILL.
Governor Disapproves Measure Pro-
viding for Twelve- Hour Day.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 21.â Governor
Paidee has vetoed Senator Wolfe's pet
measure' which provide^ for twelve
hour work days for members of the
San Francisco Fire Department. Wolfe
put his best efforts In this bill, and is
keenly disappointed over the fact that
all his good intentions have gone for
naught.
The Governor's explanation that
he holds the bill to be unconstitutional
and one that is of municipal concern
alone, meets the legal but not the
moral views of Wolfe. He said to
night that notwithstanding the ulti
mate fate of the bill, he was satisfied
it wÂ«,-uld have a good effect in calling
to the attention of the people of the
metropolis the fact that the men that
protect their homes against fire are
compelled to be on duty twenty-four
hours a dtÂ«y.
Three bills received the Governor's
signature. The first was Senator Luk
ens' bill relative to the amount of real
estate that may be held by corpora
tions whose object is not pecuniary
profit. The second was Senator Nel
son's bill providing for the acquisition
by the State of the old mission at So
noma, the Fort Ross property, the
landing place at Monterey of Junipero
Serra and the old theater at Monterey.
The third measure to receive executive
approval was Assemblyman Sever
ance's bill appropriating $4119 71 out of
the State school book fcund to pay the
claim of Btnestell. Richardson & Co.

hcur to-night the nurses in charge of
Spnator Emmons, who was operated
on to-day for appendicitis, said he was
progressing as favorably as could be
expected under the circumstances.
His temperature was about normal, the
nurse said, and his pulse had fallen
from 120 to 10fi, which the physicianÃ
considered favorable. Speaking about
the prospects of Emmons' recovery,
Senator McKee, who is a surgeon and
who aided at the operation, said:
"Senator Emons is very low. We
found that the appendix had burst and
that considerable puss had escaped
into the abdominal cavity. I do not
look for favorable results, but he may
live for several days. Of course a re
covery ks possible, but I do not look
for it."

BOOKS MARKED
BY GLADSTONE
Library of the Grand Old
Man Reveals Annotations
in Pencil on the Margins
AUTHOR'S LIBEL SUITS
Cropland, Who Speaks 111 of
Others, Objects to I nkind
Words Concerning Himself
LONDON, Feb. 21 â It seems that
the late W. E. Gladstone was one of
those book lovers who delight in
marking sentences that please them
; and scribbling comments on the text
|in the margins of volumes read. An
anonymous writer in the Book Month
ly, who recently paid a visit to the
"Crand Old Man's library at Hawarden,
says that almost every book therein
| contains profuse penciled annotations
In Gladstone's own hand. His favorite
works are filled with them.
"Vertical single or double lines,"
suys the writer, "or a small V-shaped
mark, call attention and generally Im
ply approval; dissent is signified by a
cress. X. B." and 'query* or a note
oi interrogation are frequent."'
Even Gladstone's novels are filled
with comments in pencil, especially
1 v.hen these works bear on religious
questions.
"Better, I think, than some others
! of those novels that play tricks with
nature. W. E. G.," is the judgment
at the end of one.
"In a certain political work," says
the writer, "an allegation of a certain
: diplomatic and parliamentary trans
| action with Russia in 1870 under
j Gladstone's leadership evokes the
; straight comment Untrue,' thrice re
i peated in the space of four lines. 'We
i scarcely think Mr. Gladstone,' writes
! the late Walter Bagehot, 'that this
! style of oratory is the very highest.'
I Against this Mr. Gladstone wrote "He
] n*ver thought so.' "
WORKS ON DISRAELI. ' '
Naturally a work dealing wtfh his
great rival, Disraeli, drew comments
in profusion from the great Liberal.
In his account of the famous maiden
speech in the House of Commons, the
author of this book tells how the
young Disraeli described Lord Mel
bourne as "flourishing in one hand the
j keys of St. Peter." "In the other,"
says the author, "he was understood to
be going to say "the cap of liberty,'
but the close of the sentence was
di owned in derisive shouts." "I heard
it." testifies Gladstone's pencil.
The wTiter of this essay says that
the books read in Gladstone's closing
years are fully marked and indexed
as if he yet had a lifetime in which to
' use them.
Thomas Hardy, at his home in Dor
i Chester, which in his novels he called
Casterbridge. is now working on a new
volume of poems, his third, which he
hopes to publish in the spring. He is
elso engaged in working over the ma
terial for the second and third vol
ume of his Napoleonic drama, "The
Dynasts." He says it is quite impos
sible to tell when these two volumes,
or even one of them, will be ready.
WRITER SI !-:s CRITIC.
It is true that T. W. H. Crosland is
violently averse to taking his own
medicine, or can it be â as was hinted
in the King's Bench Court the other
I day â that the author of "The Un
speakable Scot" is bringing a series
of libel suits for advertising purposes?
! Not long ago Crosland write a book
called "Lovely Wom^n," in which he
roasted the fair sex. Among other
things he observed, "When I look out
upon life in my calmer moments I
am prone to wish that all women were
widows."
In reviewing the book a London
critic remarked that it seemed cer
tain that the universe would be a
more peaceable place in which to live
if one woman was at least a widow.
This remark so offended Crosland that
he brought suit for libel against the
newspaper, but the Judge said the
criticism was justified.
A little later G. E. Farrow pub
lished a reply to "Lovely Woman."
which he called "Lovely Man." and in
which he too made a remark that if
all married men were like unto Cros
land widowhood would undoubtedly
be by far the happier state for their
wives. A few days ago Crosland sued
Farrow on the ground that the latter
had attacked his private character.
Again he lost his suit.
HIMSELF AN OFFENDER.
"It is not in woman's watery blood
to be loyal." wrote Crosland, amiably. |
"If you want loyalty and honor you !
will never go to a woman for them, !
no matter how old she may be." He
also said: "A girl of 10 is faithless, |
spiteful, greedy, mercilesÃ, unruly and i
illogical, and at 20 she is the same j
girl, only more cunning and a trifle
more commercial."
The book abounds in delicate com- <
ments of this sort, "A man can carry
a skin full of liquor like a gentleman.
A woman never gets drunk like a i
lady."
Crosland's abhorrence of personali
ties comes the less gracefully from
i him in view of this comment from
his book on Miss Ellen Thornycroft
Fowler, who, the author said, he
wished had never been born.
"How any thinking being can wish
| to read her books passes one's com
prehension." snapped Crosland. "But,
, of course, it must be remembered that
| she writes for women and that possi
bly her only two male readers are
Dr. Robertson Nichol and her papa,
the Right Hon. Sir Henry, whom I
I last beheld on a Calais boat eating
buns out of a bag."
The opposing lawyer declared that
Crosland had brought his action
merely for the purpose of selling his
book and affirmed that whenever the
author of. "The Unspeakable Scot"
wanted a little enjoyment he "popped
round to the law courts with a little
ready money and took action." He
! also pointed out that Crosland had not
j paid the cost of appeal in hia other
libel suit and that the writer had an
unsatisfied County Court judgment
against him and a bill of sale.
RARE BOOK ABANDONED.
Owing to the death of the Rev.
Richard Lovett, a book has been
abandoned which promised to be a
most valuable addition to the bibliog
raphy of the Bible. The book in
question was to have been entitled
"The Printed English Bible, 1525
1769," and it aimed at placing its pos
sessor as nearly as possible in the po
sition of one who had access to every
volume of the Scriptures published
between those dates. Such is the
rarity of many of the early editions of
the English Bible that it is a difficult
matter to get even a sight of many of
the most important copies.
Calotype fac-similes, which were to
have been the chief feature of Lovett's
costly w r ork. would have rendered re
course to the originals unnecessary.
Biblical scholars, who had been look
ing forward to the publication of the
volume with great interest, deeply re
gret the announcement made by the
Oxford Press that owing to the au
thor's death the work will not be is
sued.

Paroled Russian Officers Violate
Pledge to Admiral McCalla.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 21.â The Navy
Department to-day received a report
from Admiral McCaila. commandant of
the Mare Island navy yard, stating
that the three Russian officers of the
I-jena who left the ship at San Fran
cisco and are now in St. Petersburg
gave him, individually and personally,
their paroles not io go beyond the lim
its of San Francisco, except upon the
express permission of the President of
the United States, or in accordance

reached touching their movements be

The Russian officers were granted
a week's leave from their ship, which
lies at Mare Island, to visit San Fran
dsco, their applications being approved
by the captain of the Lena. The navai
officials here teel that it is only fair
to this officer to say that he is greatly
distressed at their disappearance. He
supplied Admiral McCalla with such
information as he had been able to ob
tain touching the whereabouts of the
three officers. Therefore, no onierÃ
have been sent to Admiral McCalla to
suspend further paroles in the case of
the Lena's officers and crew and he will
be allowed to exercise his discretion.

the deed was an act of duty The
Grand Dukes had for years violated
every' canon of ordinary decency and
ruined the country, while exploiting
the weak will of the Emperor for their

NEW YORK. Feb. 11â Ten million

market value of Standard Oil stock on

steady selling of small lots, the price
decl:r.ed from â¬10 to 596. a drop of 14
points, but it recovered 4 points before

treme low price of 596 to-day the stock
soid exactly 60 points under the price
prevailing a week ago. when it changed
hands at 646. Fifteen points of this is
due to the quarterly dividend. Ti.e
actual net decline, therefore, at Ul

LEASE WILL BE RENEWED
Sale of o<tagT Indian Lands Consid-
ered by Cabinet.
WASHINGTON, Feb. '21. â Careful
consider?. nor. was given to-day by the
PrÂ«*Fident and members of the Cabi
net to the proposed extension of the
ten year lease of oil rights on the
Indian lands In Oklahoma.
Both ihe President and Secretary
Hitchcock have received in letters and
ams protests against the exten
f the lei^se, because It is urged
th** sil rights practically are controlled
by the oil trust. Many of these pro
have come from the Kansas
Legislature.
It has been decided, with the ap
â J of the Cabinet, that It would
to some of the lessees, â who
â  quired vested rights under con
the Indians, not to extend
â¢ si Secretary Hitchcock told
Cabinet it was not true that the
-.â res agreed upon under the
srd renewal included all of the
Btfs in the Osa^je Reservation.
I was quite likely all of the
- contained oil.
The announcement was authorized
'he administration will stand by
mited extension contained in the
r.endment to the Indian ap
â¢ â¢:: bill. The Senate amend
ment provides that any allotments
may be made of the Osage reser
k shall be made sub
tftM terms and conditions of a
.â¢â â¢ a*-* .i^ied March 16. 1896, giren by
I i(c aattoa to Edwin B. Foster.
This iea*e was approved by the Secre
bC the Interior, and through as-
similarly approved, is now
1 by the Indian Territory Illu
minating Oil Company. The extension
: Fter lease' for a term of ten
- t" the property actually de
veloped under the original lease ie au
thorized by the amendment. The lands
developed amount to about 680,000
â  extension is authorized , of
the leaee covering about 820.000 acres
<>f oil fields that remain undeveloped.
The subject of the proposed investi
gations of the operations of the oil
interests in the Kansas field was dis
! L but no definite â¢ conclusions
further than those already announced
reached. The investigation will
â¢:ducted by the Bureau of Cor
ons under the direction of Com
oner Garfleld. His report will be
made to the President for transmission
to Congress later. It is quite certain
that if the facts developed by the in
quiry should warrant action by the
Government. the matter will be
brought by the President to the atten
tion of the Department of Justice.
William T. Lethy. a member of the
il of the Osage Indian tribe, in
h statement given out to-day, says that
the Indians are opposed to the re
newal of the oil lease on their
lands upon the existing terms and are
?ting against a renewal. The
original lease given to E. B. Foster
loi a period of ten years, the state
ment says, was approved contrary to
the wishes of the Indians. The state
ment Rflfca. that the President order
an Investigation to disclose all the
facts.
WOULD END THE LEASE.

Minority Renders Report on West
Virginia Scandal.
CHARLESTON. W. Va., Feb. 21. â
The majority report of the joint legis
lative investigating committee, which
picbed into the corruption charges in
volving the Standard Oil Company,
was adopted by the House of Delegates
to-day. Two reports were made, one
by the majority members and the
other by the minority members. An
effort to substitute the latter for the
majority report was defeated.
The charges r* ' ;rred to were con
tained in a letter United States Mar
shal Elliott to j van Worthington, a
Standard oil employe. The majority
numbers found that the letter was
written by Elliott and that the charges
contained therein were untrue and the
legislators are vindicated and exon
erated. -
The minority- report, states tint the
conspiracy alleged was uninvestigated
and the majority of the committee re
lwMpd the testimony tending to prove
a political conspiracy. The minority
report continues:
We further find that the Speaker of the
House of Delegates was directly Interested In
the legislation which *a* the principal sub
ject of Inquiry, and in being so interested he
resisted the passage of the bills; that the Sec
retary of State participated in the resistance
to the extent of procuring their recommittal;
that it was represented to the said Secretary
of State by the Speaker and others that if
they were recommitted they would be de
feated. The conduct of the Speaker in this
behalf is shown to have been most indiscreet,
as la also that of the Secretary of State.

Kansas on Warpath for Big Corpo-
rations.
TOPEKA, Feb. 21.â The Fentiment
in favor of making a clean sweep of
the corporations in Kansas is growing.
To-day a resolution was introduced in
the Senate providing for an investiga
tion of the beef, grain coal, implement,
milling and lumber combines. The
evidence gained in the investigation
will be presented to the Governor and
Attorney General for action. The
Standard Oil Company will bo closely
watched in the meantime.
The Oil Producers' Association an
nounces that the fight against the
Standard will not be relaxed no mat
ter what may be the outcome of the
State oil refinery plan and pending
legislation. H. E. We6t. president of
the association, announces that Frank
E. Monnett has been retained to assist
in gathering evidence. During his
term as Attorney General in Ohio
Monnett brought suit against the
Standard Oil Company to revoke its
charter for alleged violation of the
anti-trust laws.
C. A. Walsh of Ottumwa, lowa, a
former secretary of the Democratic
National Committee, is here represent
ing William R. Hearst. His instruc
tions are to look the field over with a
view of learning all he can for the use
of the officers in the prosecution of the
Standard. He says that Hearst will
assist in forcing the investigation to a
conviction. He says Shearn, the law
yer who prosecuted the anthracite coal
cases, has been retained to assist in
the Standard Oil investigation.
Hearst's plan is to bring proceedings
against the Standard under the Sher
man anti-trust law.
The Senate Oil and Gas Committee
to-day brought in a majority and a
minority report on the anti-pumping
gas bill. The minority favors the
measure, which has already passed the
House.

railroads and Standard Oil Company
are fighting, has been made a special
order for to-morrow In tfce Senate.
Kansas officers have to-day received
assurances that the Legislatures of

and California are strongly In favor of
the oil campaign being waged in Kan

SPRINGFIELD, 111., Feb. 21.â The
House to-day adopted two resolutions
affecting the Standard Oil Company.
One, offered bÂ«- Representative Allen,
offers to lend the State of Kansas the
sum of $100,000 without interest for a
period of six years to aid in establish
ing a State oil refinery and refers to
the Standard OH Company as that
'merciless octopus whose tentacles
now encircle every State in the Union."
The resolution was adopted by a viva
voce vote amid considerable confusion
and laughter.
A resolution by Representative Mc-
Goorty of Chicago asks for an investi
gation of the layinr of pipe lines
through Illinois by the Standard Oil
Company ancl provides for the appoint

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 22. 1905.
ELLIS EVADES
MANY QUERIES
Serjeant's Sentence Is Put
Over, butt Board Calls Him
in the Patrolmen's Case
ATTORNEY DIRECTS HIM
Doran and McGrath of Squad
Are Now Under Fire of
Chinatown Investigation
Passing of sentence on Sergeant
Thomas P. Ellis, found guilty at the
previous meeting of neglect of duty
and unfaithful conduct, was postponed
by the Police Commissioners last night
to a week from this evening. The case
of Chief Wittman is to be called for
trial Friday evening, and it is pre
sumed that final action is not to be
taken against Ellis until that is dis
posed of.
The trial of Patrolmen Doran and
McGrath of Ellis' squad was begun
last evening, and the sergeant was
called as a witness by the commission.
He had an uncomfortable half hour de
clining to answer questions as to his
accepting bribe money in Chinatown
and questions that tended to involve
Chief Wittman.
Directly the Ellis matter was put
over, the cases against the five patrol
menâHenry M. Heinz, R. R. O'Brien,
Henry T. McGrath, William Doran
and Charles E. Munnâ were called.
Munn was not present because of ill
ness. Attorney Maurice Asher an
nounced that he wished to try Doran.
McGrath and Munn together and to
postpone the cases of Heinz and
O'Brien. These two members of the
Ellis squad confessed to the Grand Jury
that they accepted bribes from the
Chinese games to afford protection
from interference.
Munn being absent the Commission
ers refused to include him. and the
trial of Doran and McGrath proceeded.
Former Commissioner H. W. Hutton,
who preferred the charges against El
lis and the patrolmen of the squad, was
first called and he once more told of
his visits to Chinatown, the raids he
led and the evidence he found that
gamhling was in full blast despite the
patrol of the squad.
"Do you think a squad of five patrol
men under command of one sergeant
could suppress all of the 105 fantan and
lottery games in Chinatown?" queried
Attorney Ash.
"Sergeant Cook did it two years ago
and is doing it now," was Hutton's
reply.
ELLIS OX THE STAND.
Commissioner Drinkhouse called for
Ellis. The sergeant's attorney, Rich
ard Mogan, took a seat beside Attorney
Asher as the witness took the stand.
"What were your instructions to the
members of your squad?" Commis
sioner Drinkhouse acting the part of
the interrogator.
"To suppess gambling to the best of
their ability."
"What were your orders from the
Chief of Police?"
"Written orders to suppress all gam
bling and lotteries in Chinatown."
"Did you receive any secret oders
from the Chief of Police?"
Attorney Mogan here took a hand.
"I must direct the witness to decline
to answer," he said. "We *o not wish
to show any disrespect to tne commis
sion, but we must assert our constitu
tional privilege."
The board did not press the ques
tion. ,
"Did you receive any money while
you were on duty in Chinatown?"
Again Mogan advised his client not
to answer.
"Do you know of any member of your
squad who received money?"
There was no objection and Ellis an
swered. "I do not."
"Where were you the night of De
cember 29, when former Commissioner
Hutton made his raid?"
"I was at the City Prison booking
prisoners I had taken."
MKT WITTMAX EVERY DAY.
"How often did Chief Wittman visit
you while you were in command of the
squad?"
"Almost every day. I would see him
as he came down from his home every
evening."
"What would you talk about?"
On the advice of his attorney Ellis
ence more declined to answer.
"I can't see why," commented Com
missioner Reagan.
"We are simply claiming our priv
ilege," was all Mogan would say.
"Suppose he is asked that question
at the trial of Chief Wittman." persist
ed Reagan, "will he then refuse, toe?"
"That will be determined on at that
time, but Tor the present we must
avoid all those matters," vouchsafed
Attorney Mogan.
"Did you ever meet any of the eight
'statesmen' while you were on duty in
Chinatown, including Chan Cheung?"
resumed Drinkhouse, but Mogan could
not be drawn into that kind of a twist.
Asher cross-examined the sergeant,
and among other things brought out the
declaration that "no matter how many
policen.en were detailed in Chinatown j
the Chinese would continue to gamble."
Sergeant Ellis was excused and the
trial continued to Wednesday evening, i
a week from to-day.
Will Be His Own Detective.
Nathan Corinson, a property-owner
in the Western Addition, secured a
warrant from Police Judge Mogan
yesterday for the arrest of "John
Doe" on a charge of burglary. Corin.
son explained to the Judge that he
was one of the many victims of the
man who is stealing globes and lead
pipe from vacant houses. He had a
number of automatic burners stolen
from one of his vacant houses at 1346
Green street. He says he would know
the man if he met him and he wanted
to be able to arrest him on sight. The
man is described as 42 years of age,
5 feet 8 inches tall and liffht com

Drink Destroys Bright Mind.
An old man who gives his name as

tortures of delirium tremens at the
Central Emergency Hospital, having
been gathered from the street by the
police. In his lucid intervals it is ap

COAST LIMITED DASHES INTO A LANDSLIDE,
CAUSING TWO DEATHS AND MANY INJURIES
LOCOMOTIVE IS OVERTURNED
William Lowrie, Rifling With Engineer, Crushed
anfl a Number of Passengers Badly Hurt.
A landside on the coast division of
the Southern Pacific Company a mile
west of Santa Anita was responsible
for a serious wreck late Monday night,
when the first section of the north
bound pasenger train No. 9 crashed
into the piled up debris, overturned its
locomotive, derailed several of its cars,
killed outright one man, hastened the
end of another and injured ten or fif
teen other persons.
The accident occurred in a deep cut
and at the beginning of a curve, at
which point the engine left the track
and was thrown across the rails. The
oil tank was twisted about in a dif
ferent direction, the baggage car was
thrown up on the embankment on the
right of the track, while two tourist
cars and a dining car following were
thrown across the track. Five Pull
man sleepers that completed the train
section remained on the rails, and their
passengers, but for the sudden jolting
of their cars at that unusual hour of
the night, would not have become
aware that a wreck had occurred.
Tho trainmen and passengers in the
forward part of the train had quite a
different experience and that there
were not a greater number of fatalities
or an awful calamity is regarded as a
miracle. It was a few minutes after
11 o'clock when the rays of the loco
motive headlight revealed to Engineer
Thompsons experienced and watchful
eye an obstruction a few yards in front
of tho train, which was then running
about thirty miles an hour. Before he
could reverse his lever the engine had
plunged into a mass of rock and earth
that had been washed into the cut from
the towering walls on each side of the
track. Thompson and Fireman T. G.
Nigrich and the letter's assistant, G.
C. Cale, were thrown by the force of
the collision into the bottom of the
engine cab and were all bruised and
partially scalded by the escaping
steam.
IX>\VRIE'S DEATH.
Another occupant of the engine cab
was William Lowria of this city, who
had been experimenting with a boiler
protection compound, and for the pur
pose of watching its effect on the
Southern Pacific Company's boilers he
had been making trips up and down
the coast division on the locomotives.
When the crash came, Lowrie was
standing in the cab with his hand lean
ing on the fireman's seat. The sudden
jolt and the lurching of the engine as
it swung from the track threw him
out of the cab to the ground and as the
engine left the rails and careened over
to the left against the embankment
his body was caught under the side of
the cab and horribly crushed. It was
several minutes after the crash before
the engineer and firemen, who had
been partially stunned, were able to
appreciate the situation, and by that
time Conductor E. Mengle and several
of the passengers in the rear Pullman
sleepers had undertaken to rescue the
injured and pacify the excited occu
pants of the tourist coaches.
Among the first to go to the rescue
was B. Norman of Spokane, who oc
i cupied a berth in one of the Pullman
; sleepers, and he was followed by Dr.
I A. Happersberger of this city, L. S.
! Donaldson of Minnearwlis and J. G.
i Compton and N. S. Ballinger of Tucson.
i Hurrying forward Norman's attention
i v.as attracted to the face of Conductor
! Mengle peering through the glass of
the rear door of the baggage car,
where the latter had been making up
his ticket account when the accident
occurred.
Mengle was frantically yelling for
help, for the cars had been so badly
wrenched that he was unable to open
the door. When Norman succeeded in
forcing the door open he found Mengle
half dazed from a blow on the head,
over which blood w-as streaming down
on his face. The fresh air of the
night, however, quickly revived him
and shoving Moran aside the in
jured conductor staggered off the car
platform and started for the rear of
the train. Although badly hurt, he
forgot his own injuries in his en
deavor to insure the safety of his pas
st ngers.
The conductor knew that the sec
ond section of the train was rapidly
approaching and foresaw the probable
catastrophe that would result from
a collision between the two trains.
"A brakeman must be sent to the
rear," he shouted to Norman and
called to the latter to help htm bark
to the end of the train. Before he
reached the last car, however, the
brakeman had started out on his mis
sion and the threatening calamity was
averted.
PASSENGERS TERRIFIED.
Meanwhile pandemonium prevailed
among the passengers in the forward
ccaches. The latter, like the baggage
car, had been wrenched so that the
doors could not be opened by the
frenzied occupants, a number of whom
made their escape from the car win
dows. The injured, of which there
wtre about fifteen, were not so fortu
nate and were finally rescued through
holes cut in the bottom of the cars.
While this work was in progress
the engineer and the firemen had been
taken in charge by the passengers.
Engineer Thompson was soon on his
feet and assisting in aiding his in
jured companions, both of whom were
suffering a great deal from their
burns and bruises. After satisfying
themselves that Lowrie was dead thf
rescue party turned their attention to
the wounded passengers, who were
rapidly being taken from the coaches.
While passing along the wreck En
gineer Thompson discovered that the
oil from the engine tank had escaped
and was slowly flowing down under
the coaches*. It would require but a
flash of fire to ignite the oil and once
ablaze it would soon have set fire to
the cars, probably roasting many of
the panic-stricken imprisoned pas
sengers.
Suddenly several of the passengers
who had escaped from the cars re
alized the danger threatening those
inside the coaches and by advising the
latter of their danger greatly added
to the pani<^ Engineer Thompson,
however, returned to the still chug
ging engine and with the assistance of
several passengers managed to ex
tinguish the oil burners and thus al
layed the fears of the other passen
gers. The gas in the coaches was,
however, permitted to burn all night,
for the majority of the passengers re
fused to return to their coaches and
made their beds on the ground be
tween the oars.
CARS BLOCK TRACKS.
The tut in which the accident oc
curred has a wall on one side of about
sixty feet in height and on the other
of about twenty feet, so that with the
cars crossed upon the tracks and
practically blocking the way it is easy
to picture the terrible loss of life thar

train come ahead and piled itself upon
the wrecq and the scores of passen
gers. Toward morning the conductor
managed to get a message back to
Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, from
both of which places rescue parties
were sent to the scene of the wreck.
Later in the day the injured train
men were sent back to Los Angeles on
a special train, that also bore the body
of Lowrie to Santa Barbara. The' bal
ance of the injured were brought to
this city on a train arriving here last
evening at 9:30 o'clock.
Among the passengers on this train
was A. White of Minneapolis, Ameri
can Vice Consul to Shanghai, who oc
cupied a berth in one of the Pullman
coaches of the wrecked train. Although
he was not injured in the wreck, the
shock of the collision so unnerved him
that shortly after leaving San Jose last
evening he was suddenly attacked with
a hemorrhage and died a few minutes
later. His body was turned over to a
local undertaker. When the train ar
rived here last evening none of the
passengers" injuries were regarded as
sufficiently serious to warrant their
going to the Railroad Hospital and
they were assisted in getting accommo
dations for the night at various hotels.

Interesting Experiment in a Restaur-

Â«VVBPqHHWiHnMMIH9HBHPmm
An advertising agent, representing a
prominent New York magazine, while
on a recent Western trip, was dining
one evening in a Pittsburg restaurant.
While waiting for his order he
glanced "over his newspaper and . no-
ticed the advertisement of a well-
known dyspepsia preparation. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets. As he himselr
was a regular user of the tablets he
began speculating as to how many
of the other traveling men in the
dining-room were also friends of thÂ»
popular remedy for indigestion.
He says: I counted twenty-three
men at the tables, and in the hotel
office I took the trouble to interview
trÂ«em and was surprised to learn that
nine of the twenty-three made% a
practice of taking one or two of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets after each
meal.
One of them told me he had suf-
fered so much from stomach trouble
that at one time he had been obliged
to quit the road, but since using Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets he had been
entirely free from indigestion, but
he continued their use. especially
while traveling, on account of irregu-
larity In meals and because, like all
traveling men. he was often obliged
to eat what he could get and not al-
ways what he wanted.
Another, who looked the picture of
health, said he never ate a meal with-
out taking a Stuart Tablet afterward
because he could eat what he pleased
and when he pleased without fear of
a sleepless night or any other trouble.
Still another used them because he
was subject to gas on stomach, caus-
ing pressure* on heart and lungs,
shortness of breath and distress' in
chest, which he no longer experienced
since using the tablets regularly.
Another claimed that Stuarts Dys-
pepsia Tablets was the only safe
remedy he had ever found for soup
stomach and acidity. He had for-
merly used common soda to relieve
the trouble, but the tablets were much
better and safer to use.
After smoking, drinking or other
excesses which weaken the digestive
organs, nothing restores the stomach
to a healthy, wholesome condition so
effectually as Stuart's Tablets.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain
the natural digestives, pepsin, dias-
tase, which every weak stomach lacks,
as well as nux, hydrastin and yellow-
parilla.. and can be safely relied on as
a radical cure for every form of poor
digestion. Sold by druggists every-

Among the several witnesses put on

in the Yoell will contest were two
l'rcminent members of the San Fran-

'â¢pinion that the departed attorney was
of sound mind, though eccentric. One
of these was Colonel J. J. Tobin, who
knew YopH for a dozen years before
his death and considered him thor
oughly sane. The other. Frank Jaynes.
genera! superintendent of the West
ern Union, said: 'I thought him
v*-ry singular but never doubted his
sanity. He was eccentric, excitable,
exacting and somewhat disagreeable."
Attorney Delmas. for the apparent
purpose of impeaching the testimony
of John H. Yoell, son of the deceased,
Mary A. Welch Scully of San
i< se. The present Mrs. Scully is the
vidow of one Welch who had John
Yoell as an attorney. She detailed
the circumstances of certain notes in
which young Yoell had an interest,
culminating in her declaration to the
Htfpr Yoell that his son had robbed
her. She said that the father told
the son that he ought to be in the
penitentiary for robbing a widow and
orphans. On cross-examination by
Mr. Hoofler it developed that Mrs.
Stully was not personally familiar
with the execution of the notes in
ffueÂ«tion and she will be questioned
further next Monday, to which day the
trial was adjourned.

HATCHET HANGS
IN THE HALLS
OF EBELL CLUB
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, Feb. 21.â Although the hatchet,
which hag come to be an inevitable feature oÂ£
every Washington's birthday celebration, was
prominent in the decoration of Ebell's club
rooms to-day, there wag little "knocking"
for the clever member* of the living isjuei
section presented so flawless a programme
that even the chronic faultfinder wag at a
loss for criticism.
Mrs. L. F. Cockroft is curator of the living
issues section and was editor in chief of the
burlesque newspaper that was evolved with
the assistance of her feminine staff. The stage
represented the proverbial disorderly sanctum,
with "exchanges" scattered recklessly over
the floor, "proof" pinned handily to a screen
that protected the ".ilitor" from draught and
l-osters and bulletin boards all over the wall?.
The "copy" that was read by different mem
bers of the staff was original and where not
serious wag replete with satire and witticisms.
The Japanese-Russian war was the prin
cipal topic of the day. with a "column" or
two devoted to the Czar and his troubles and
en editorial on Washington's birthday. It
would astonish the news editor of one of our
great dallies to hear the editor of "Living
It-iiues"" calmly relegate "stuff" enough to the
"front patre" to fill an ordinary newspaper.
Mrs, Cockroft made a hit with a doggerel
constructed after the fashion ol" the "House
That Jack Built" about "The Throne the
C/.ar Hits On." Some original rhymes by Mrs.
Paul Lohfce were amusing and several bright
little Kiuibs on the water question and some
burlesque recipes kept the audience In merry
mood. Mrs. Prupham as the society editor
handed out some amusing little "knocks."
Mrs. AHen Babcoek represented a colonial
"cut" that adorned the first page of the
"newspanr."
The editor and her "staff" were all gowned
in newspaper dresses that were really artistic
and becoming and eat'h clever head was
topped with a quaint cocked hat or mortar
board of paper.
The natal day of the "father of his coun
try" was suggested In the decorations and in

Testimony in Fletdier Will
Case Goes to Show That
Captain's Mind Failed
BRAIN WAS CONFUSED
North Star Set for Him and
Charts No Longer Showed
Him the Ship's Course
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Feb. 21.
Captain Leroy Fletcher was unable
to recognize the north star and could
no longer calculate his reckoning by
the charts, bo he was considered as
mentally Incompetent by Captain J.
N. Ross some months ago. He finally
gave up the command of the steamship
San Mateo, and a deposition to this ef
fect was read to the jury now listening
to evidence whereby Albert Fletcher,
the son, hopes to break his father's
will in which he was disinherited.
Shortly before his death Captain
Fletcher turned against his family and
left his wealth to strangers, and an
attempt is being made to show that
his action was due to mental aberra
tion. In support of this proof was
grven in the deposition of Captain
Ross, who was first mate under Cap
tain Fletcher during his life. One
night when it was perfectly clear and
the vessel was not far away from Cape
Flattery, Fletcher asked Ross is he
could see the light. Ross pointed the
beacon out to him. He told Ross the
charts were no longer any good and
one day asked the cabin boy where the
dishes were when the table had been
set before him.

MINE YIELDS
FIFTY BODIES
Indications That a Hundred
and Sixteen Men Perished
in Alabama Catastrophe
FAMILIES DESTITUTE
Breath of Life Still Exists
in but One Victim Taken
From Depths of Diggings
BIRMINGHAM, Ala,, Feb. 21.â The
scene at the Virgina mine this after
noon, where a terrific after-damp ex
plosion yesterday afternoon Imprisoned
116 men 700 feet below the surface, was
the most grewsome and harrowing that
has ever been witnessed in this section
of Alabama. Of the miners who en
tered the shaft yesterday afternoon,
so far fifty bodies have been recov
ered. The recovery of so many dead
bodies indicates that no living men re
main among the unfortunates still in
the mine.
The corpses are frightfully mangled
and disfigured and identification Is al
most impossible: Many of them are so
badly bruised and twisted and discol
ored that negroes cannot be told from
white men. One hundred families and
;>OO children are left destitute and with
out means of support by the calamity,
and they are of the best class of min
ing families in Alabama.
The bodies of the victims, which in
many cases have been gathered to
gether a piece at a time and brought
to the surface, have been placed in
rows on a rough platform, and to
right ambulances began the removal
of those so far recovered to Bessemer.
The excavation of the debris has
been hampered. The foul gases which
had collected in the stope made neces
sary the use of safety lamps and it
was found that less thin a score of
these were available in the district.
Union miners went to the scene from
practically all the mining camps with
in a radius of twenty-five miles to aid
in the work of rescue.
Out of the fifty bodies recovered up
to this time, one was found at about
4 o'clock this afternoon which was
barely alive. The body was carefully
taken from the mine and heroic meth
ods resorted to to bring the man to
consciousness. He is still alive, but
scant hope is held out for his recovery.
President Flynn of the Alabama
Mine Workers said to the Associated
Preps to-ntelit:
I chall be surprised if a single person escapes
a:i\> from that mine. Ventilation is very
difficult and if the men were not killed by
the explosion they certainly have been suf
focated by the Eases. The bodies go far re
covered were in the main stop*, and it will
be several days before we can get to the
rooms which branch off.
VICTORY FOR EQUITABLE
EM WISCONSIN* COURT
Society Held to Be Within the Law In
Issuing Deferred Dividend
Policies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADISON. Wis.. Feb. 21. â The test
case by the Equitable Life Assurance So
ciety on behalf of the foreign Insurance
companies doing business in the State of
Wisconsin has resulted in a signal vic
tory through the decision handed down
by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin to
day, reversing the decision of the Dane
County Circuit Court in favor of Com
missioner Host.
The question involved the construction
of section 1952 of the Revised Statutes,
the Commissioner maintaining that the
word "may." as used in the statute,
should be construed as mandatory and
that the Iâlimn of lefcrred dividend
policies was prohibited by the statute as
thus construed. The Supreme Court
holds that the statute as thus construed
is permissive, that the Equitable has not
violated the law in issuing deferred divi
dend policies, and that the latter form
of policy, which constitutes seventy-five
to eighty per cent of all the insurance
written, is valid and not in conflict with
any provision of the. law.
This marks the end of one of the most
interesting and important cases In life
insurance for many years. The case was
presented on behalf of the society by J.
G. Flanders. D. T. "Watson, and Bain
bridge Colby of Alexander & Colby,
counsel for the society in New York. The
Commissioner of Insurance was repre
sented by the Attorney General of Wis
consin.

CLOVERDALE IN GALA GARB
Citrus Fair Attracts Large
Crowds to Thriving Town.
WONDERFUL RESOURCES OF THE DISTRICT ARE SHOWN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLOVERDALE, Feb. 21.â With per
fect weather and with all that goes to
make for success, the thirteenth an
nual citrus fair of the Cloverdale Cit
rus Fair Association was oDened to
day. Never has the array of exhibits
more strongly exemplified the soil and
climate of Cloverdale, and the contigu
ous country; never have zeal, taste,
industry and experience in exhibition
work been more effectively employed
at Cloverdale. Men, women and chil
dren have toiled together, actuated by
'patriotic desire, to furnish attractions
sufficient to draw people in from the
surrounding counties and to justify all
expectations. The pretty town of Clo
verdale has reason to be proud of the
result. No more beautiful show of
similar size has been seen in Califor
nia than is the present one at Clover
dale.
.In a general way the present fair re
sembles those that have gone before.
Oranges, lemons, olives and foliage are
used to adorn set designs. The quan
tity of fruit is larger and the designs
are handsomer. Collectively they make
up quite an imposing show in the as
sociation's pavilion. The ladies of the
Episcopal church decorated the pavil
ion with carnival colors, orange, green
and white. Streamers are looped from
end to end of the pavilion. Numerous
electric lights are above the exhibits.
Whpn the navilion is lighted, the dis
play is brilliant. The Citrus Associa
tion officers are: President, W. T.
Brush; secretary, George B. Baer; di
rectors â J. B. Cooley, G. Hagmayer, J.
H. Barnes and S. Pinschower. T. B.
Wilson is general superintendent.
The Citrus Association owns the pa
vilion and site and has money in the
bank enough to provide for the erec
tion of an addition to the pavilion that
will double its present floor space.

House Passes .Philippines
Tariff Bill Practically as
Reported by Committee
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â The House
to-day passed the Philippines tariff
bill, practically as it came from the
committee and with but little discus
sion.
An effort to prohibit the Importation
of opium into the islands except for
medicinal purposes failed.
An unsuccessful attempt was made
by Cooper of Texas and Webb of North
Carolina to place on the free list raw
cotton and cotton waste imported into
the Philippines from the Untted States
and Spain, the latter country being in
cluded so as not to violate the terms
of the treaty of Paris regarding dis
crimination. The amendment was de
feated, 95 to 99.
Unavailing efforts subsequently were
made to place agricultural implements
and agricultural products, locomotives,
etc., on the free list, and a similar fate
was accorded a proposition by Cooper
of Texas to tax diamonds in the rough.
Cooper of Texas moved to recommit
the bill with instructions to place cot
ton and cotton manufactures, iron,
leather, etc., on the free list. The mo
tion was lost.
The bill was then passed without
division.
General applause followed the adop
tion of a Joint resolution authorizing
the return by the Secretary of War of
Union and Confederate battle flags to
the respective States in which the regi
ments which born them were organized.

RAIN SPOILS
THE ICE CROP
Sierra Nevada Output Is
Rained and Owners Suf
fer a Loss of $75,000
RENO, Feb. 21.â Heavy rains and the
warm temperature during the past few
days have ruined the ice crop in the
Sierra Nevada mountains. Hundreds
of men that were busily engaged last
week in harvesting the crop are now
idle and several of the companies have
sent- instructions to their superintend
ents to close down for the season.
The crop will be between 25.000 and
50,000 tons short, experts figure. How
ever, this is made up for by the hold
over crop from last year .amounting
to about 30,000 tons. For this reason it
is thought the ice men in the hills will
be well able to handle the California
fruit crop the coming season.
The thawing started with between
ten and fifteen inches of ice on the
ponds. In a few hours the entire crop
was ruined and the loss to the ice men,
figuring at $1 50 per ton, will amount
to about $75,000.

Her Case in Illinois Court
MATRIMONIAL TANGLE
Former Spouse of Assistant
United States Attorney
General in Big Scandal
SDeclal Dispatch to The Call.
URBAN A, 111., Feb. 21.â Mrs. Susan
C. Day, the divorced wife of former
Assistant United States Attorney Gen
eral William A. Day, claimed by Dr.
Charles A. Nichols of this city as his
wife by common law marriage, scared
an important victory after three years'
litigation to-day, when Judge Philbrick
in the Circuit Court refused to ac
knowledge the alleged marriage as
legal.
The Day-Nichols case is declared to
be almost without analogy in legal an
nals, there being only one other caa*
known in which a man claimed a
woman as his wife to have her deny it.
At the time of the presentation of the
name of W. A. Day to the Senate for
confirmation Mrs. Day went to Wash
ington to fight her alleged husband
with the record of their divorce suit.
At the same time Dr. Nichols created
a sensation by announcing a secret
marriage, which was denied by Mrs.
Day. The couple were indicted by the
Grand Jury for living together, but the
indictment was quashed.
In the litigation, which has been pro
ceeding since Dr. Nichols made hia
claim, the estate of Eli Halberstadt. the
father of Mrs. Day, has dwindled from
$30,000 to almost nothing.

CHICAGO POLICE ARREST
SCORES OF "SPITTERS"
Vigorous Campaign Against Violators
of a Municipal Ordi
nance.
CHICAGO, Feb. 21. â Promiscuous
spitters who were caught in the po
lice dragnets in the downtown dis
tricts were packed so closely in Jus
tice Caverly's court in the Harrison
street police station to-day that they
were protected from further violation
of the anti-spitting law. There were
171 of the absent-minded ones â or,
rather, nearly that number â for a
dozen or more either pleaded ignor
ance of the law or "stood pat" and
trusted to the magistrate dismissing
them on the ground that their word
was as good as that of the officer that
arrested them. Several were thus dis
missed, "for lack of evidence."

HOLIDAY PASTIMES WILL DRAW THOUSANDS OUT OF DOORS
WARM SPELL HELPS BOXERS
REDUCE THEIR WEIGHT.
CORBETT AND NELSON INDULGE
IN SOME EXCITING GLOVE WORK
The weather conditions In Matin
iV.unty were favorable for the boxers
making weight yesterday and Young
icrbett and Battling Nelson worked
like troopers at their respective train
ing camps.
The people were rweltering at Nel
son's quarters at Larkspur, and when
the Dane mounted the scales after his
f-treruous day's work it was /ound he
had I^*l two pounds and a half.
Xrlson's trainers were immensely
pleased, as this brings the Battler
down to IZbhk pounds.
The proposition of making 180
pounds, which has worried Manager
Billy Nolan for the past week, is now
Â« onj=iderÂ»Â»d easy going.
Nelson put in an extra hard day's
work. He was up at daylight and
lock a walk through Baltimore Can
yon before breakfast. At 9:30 he
donned his road attire and Jogged
nearly twelve miles. In the after
noon more than an hour was spent In
the gymnasium. Bat went through
all his exercises and boxed a couple of
rounds each with Fred Landers and
Bill Bonner.
Bonner is rather a scientific boxer
and he made Quite an Impression on
the ladies presenC
All hands then made a rush for
the Bscalta bathe, where pwlmmlng

hour.
This being a holiday a large crowd

Itfetzner will do everything in his
- to accommodate Nelson's many
admirers.
Camp Corbett at Billy Shannon*
villa near Pan Rafael was a busy
place, as the little Denverite was up
with the birds and gave his trainers
no rest until late in the afternoon.

Teams of the Amateur Athletic
League Battle for Privilege to
Represent San Francisco.
The basketball team of the Mis
sion High School triumphed yester
day over that of the Polytechnic High
School by a score of . 13 to 5. The
game was played in the gymnasium
of the Young Men's Hebrew Associa
tion at 1970 Page street. The gym
nasium was crowded with enthusiastic
rooters for both teams and many
thrilling plays were made.
By defeating the Polytechnic the
Mission r>iaces itself on a footing to
meet the Lick High School team,
which defeated Lowell High. All four
teams belong to the Amateur Athletic
League, and the winner of the Mis

no lightweight it is more difficult for
him to get around.
Corbett, accompanied by Joe Gans,
jogged around Wolf's hill in the morn
ing, covering in all about fourteen
miles. The perspiration rolled from
him, but his breathing was not visibly
affected.
In the afternoon many friends vis
ited the camp to watch him work.
> mong those present were Jack
Welch, Barney Bernard and Tim Mr-
Grath. The boys insisted on calling
Bernard "Murphy," and out of respect
to hj*n both Corbett and Gans donned
green tights.
Corbett started the afternoon's work
by punching the bag for fifteen min
utes without taking a rest The regu
lation work was then gone through
and Corbett and Joe hooked up for
si>. rounds. The bout was a whirlwind
affair and if small gloves were used
a. knockout would surely have taken
prace. The pair didn't seem to mljid
the hard ones, though, and both took
them good naturedly.
Corbett then donned a bath robe and
spent fifteen minutes more doing gym
nasium stunts.
There is a quiet but determined
struggle in progress for the March
boxing permit, which will probably bÂ«
awarded by the Supervisors' Police
Committee at its meeting to-morrow.
The principal contenders for the sanc
tion are Morris Levy and Alex Greg
pains on one side and Jimmy Coffroth
ca the other.
The promoters have been busy seek
ing a match, with the result that Nel
foti has agreed to fight Britt in March
before Coffroth's club, if he defeats
Corbett. The latter is under certain
obligations to Morris Levy and he has
agreed to fight before the club the lat
ter designates.
This will make a pretty complica
tion. a.Â« 5 the various agreements are at
purposes. If Nelson wins and
Grepgains gets the permit, the nego
tiations will all have to be gone over
aualn. If Corbett wins and Coffroth
get! the permit the latter will have
to negotiate with Morris Levy for Cor
rett's services.

FIRST CHOICES GO DOWN
AT TRACK ACROSS BAY
Paul Revere Ride of Bonner on the Favorite, M. A. Powell, Is Awe
Inspiring, but He Arrives Too Late to Catch True Wing.
Mr. Dingle Finally
Succeeds in
Scoring.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The late Mr. Solomon Bonner, astride
the favorite M. A. Powell, permitted of a
clean-up being made by Tom Ryan and
his friends on True Wing in the con
cluding race on the card yesterday at
Oakland racetrack.
Harry Birkenruth rode the daughter
of The Roman and the only two start
ers that proved at all obstinate were
Andvarl and Cloudlight, and they died
early. True Wing got to the front in
the stretch and stepped over the line
first, four lengths in advance of M. A.
Powell. It was some time before Bon
ner, who handled the latter, could find
the number of his room. When there
was s< ant chance the colored Herrmann
came through with a rush, beating
Duplex for the place.
This mystifying disappearing act of
Bonner's is really an optical delusion.
He has given free open air exhibitions
on nearly all the big tracks of this
hemisphere, both with and without
music, and has met with unvarying
success.
ONE FAVORITE IN FRONT.
A careful search of the form chart
reveals the fact that Mr. Dingle was
the one successful first choice. There
was a large attendance and the betting
brisk.
Chief Wittman defeated the favorite,
Southern Lady, for the two-year-old
scramble, due to the clever riding of
He got the big chestnut away
well and overhauling Oazazza in the
stretch, beat Southern Lady out less
than a length. Semilune acted badly
at the post and ran a disappointing
race. The winner closed at odds of 18
to 5.
Johnny Schorr's three-year-old Gold
en Buck was made the medium of quite
a plunge to win the Futurity course
sprint following and missed the mark a
block. When it looked as if "Big Bill"
Knapp astride Silicate had Agnes Mack
beaten and would win, little Barrett
dropped along with Meada, a 10 to 1
shot, downing Silicate a neck. Golden
Buck faded away to nothing the last
part of the route.
On form Hulford looked a highly de
lectable morsel and was backed off the
boards to take the seven furlong sell
ing number. Wright succeeded in get
ting the good thing all but left at the
P"Pt, finishing third. Hipponax, with
Alarie in the saddle and 4V& to 1. out
stayed the SO to 1 shot Toto Gratiot,
leaching the wire first with consider
able in reserve. Suburban Queen made
a dismal showing.
ISARK.I.I.I TA WINS HANDILY.
Throe horses, Barney Dreyfuss,
Frangible and Cloche dOr, closed
equal favorites in the speculating done
<m the mile and twenty yards number.
Th'> showing they made was not an
appetizing one, for Barney Dreyfuss
alone succeeded in squeezing his way
into the first three. "Big Bill" Knapp
on Isabellita, a 5 to 1 chance, took the
lead from CJoc-he dOr on the back
stretch and at the wire disposed of
Trapsetter without effort. The Fret
ter appeared unable to negotiate the
heavy going.
At last, after having knocked at the
door on several occasions, Mr. Dingle
annexed a purse. He closed a mild fa
vorite for the mile selling fixture and,
well ridden by Jakie Jones, defeated
Blackthorn with apparent ease. Otis
finished third on Jack Little.
The Thornton stake, which closed
with thirty-three nominations, will
reopen for additional entries on
March 3.
Tennis Club Oflu-ials Meet.
Two meetings were held at the Cal
ifornia Tennis Club last night. One
was the regular monthly meeting of
the board of directors and the other
a tournament committee meeting to
arrange for to-day's handicap doubles
tournament. The principal business
transacted by the directors was the
adoption of the set of by-laws sub
mitted to the members a month ago.
The only clause that met with oppo
sition was that in relation to the play
ing of schoolboys Saturday afternoons.
The directors present were W. S.
MacGavin, Grant Smith, C. G. Kuehn,
Dr. Xoble and Dr. Lovegrove. F S.
Mitchell and Dr. Hill were absent.
The tournament committee decided
to leave the entries for to-day's tourn
ament open until 9:30 this morning.
At that time the handicaps will be ar
ranged and the drawing held.
Cardinal Men in Joint Meet.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 21.
Manager Barrett, who has for some
time been negotiating with the Uni
versity of Southern California for a
track mcci, has completed arrange
ments for a contest to be held on
March 11. The southern team is to
consist of twelve men. According' to
the agreements made each team will
only be allowed to enter three men in
each event. This should prove one of
the most closely contested meets of
the season, as the southern college
has some exceptionally good men, in
cluding a fast sprinter and a broad
jumper, who will hurry the men rep

Federal Grand Jury Presents Charges
of Subornation Against Miller,
Kincart and Boren.
The Federal Grand Jury completed
its labors yesterday in the land and
timber frauds in the Redding district
and presented an indictment against
Harry W. Miller, Frank E. Kincart
and William H. Boren, charging them
with subornation Â«of perjury. It is al
leged that they suborned and instigat
ed John M. Layton, Emma Martin
John G. Martin, John W. Campbell
and Jesse Stump to swear falsely on
November 14, 1904. in their applica
tions before the land register.
It is alleged further that the appli
cants before making oaths had en
tered into contracts for the sale of the
tracts to the Washington Mill and
Lumber Company. The tracts claimed
were portions of sections 2, 8 and 24,
in township 32 north, range 8 west.
Miller is under indictment by the
United States Grand Jury of Oregon
for a similar offense, alleged to have
committed in that State. Kincart is
under arrest in Portland, and Boren
is in the hands of the United States
Marshal of this district.

Seeks to Restrain Circulation of Ma-
licious Reports About His Obli
gation to Union.
C. E. Russell, a painting contractor,
yesterday sued for $1000 damages and
an injunction to prevent the officers
and members of the Building Tradas
Council from maliciously circulating
the report that he has violated an ob
ligation to the council stnd the Paint
ers', Decorators' and Paperhangera"
Union. His complaint is a long one
and recites the purposes of the Trades
Council and its affiliated unions, fifty
or more of which he names. He de
clares that P. H. McCarthy, president
of the council, and its other officers
and representatives have told his em
ployes anfl various building contrac
tors that he is indebted to the council
and the Painters' Union for $250. H<Â±
denies the obligation and sayg that
unless the defendants are restrained
they will enter the various buildings
upon which he is working and im
pede the labor of his men by talking
to them. He refers particularly to the
union agitation in a certain building
on Church street near Twenty-sec
ond, in which he has the painting
contract. Russell's attorneys are
Lewis & Royce.
The Bill-Posters' Union No. 35 met
Monday night and elected the follow
ing officers: President, A. A. Binchi;

*8 Orguuntioa Broad
in Its Views of Civic and
K<iucational Conditions
erday was the California Clubs
day.
And On way it passed amendments
< or ?titurion of the club would
object-lesson to the Legislatureâ
.Ã¼bility.
However, out of the discussion came
fome excellent changes in the club's
internal workings, and some mighty
statements, and if the la
dies could have refrained from the*
inborn desire to "all talk at once,"
tome really clever and logical state
would have reached the chair,
That didn't.
In all there were twenty-one amend
- to be considered, some of which
thought to be obviously i
some unnecessary, some danger
and one or two merely passive.
On half of them there was much to
fay, a deal of which was of interest
tnly to the club, but on the amend
s regulating the admission of
i: .embers came the declarations of
t reed.
The amendment proposed reads
thusly: 'Candidates failing of election
ehall not be reconsidered during the
aJ term of the membership com
mittee." To this, an amendment was
offered as follows: "Candidates failing
of election can at no future time be
proposed for membership."
Now, tMs is where the oratory of the
day was turned loose.
Among the interesting arguments
against the amendment to the amend
ment â and here's where women's
minds get twisted â was the following
statement: "The California Club is a
civic club, organized solely for uplift
. irposes, civic, social and educa
tional. Now, if a woman, because of
some act or circumstance, is pro-
ineligible to membership this
so alters her life or the circum
stances in the future, could the Cali
â  Club logically refuse her ad
nÂ° 'Not. if the club is sincere
in its pledges to help women to higher
and broader purposes," announces an
interested member, out of order.
And with loud applause was the
sentiment greeted â that women whose
are now blameless, or who in the
future may lead clean and honest lives,
if HMV secure sponsors, become
members of the club; and this because
the club is not a social organization
but a working body.
Now this IS a declaration, made
nut in meetln'. It's consistent

SUGAR PACKET ENCOUNTERS
A SERIES OF HEAVY STORMS
Gerard c. Totieu
Tossed tiij Many
Tempests.
The bark Gerard C. Tobey, Captain
Arthur H. Scott, which arrived yester
day from Honolulu, had one of the
liveliest passages ever made by sugar
packet. Gales from all points of the
compass ivere encountered during the
trip. High seas swept the vessel's
decks, washing overboard everything
movable and making life miserable
fcr all on board. During the intervals
between gales electric storms furnish
ed elaborate firework displays and
when the thunder and lightning ceased
rain poured down in furious torrents.
Several sails were blown away and
others were split. A boat was stove
in. In spite of it all the Tobey made
the trip in 22^ days.
The Tobey left Honolulu January
2j? with 38,063 bags of sugar snugly
stowed in her hold. Two days out she
struck a northerly gale which contin
ued for four days. There was a spell
of variable winds until the bark
reached latitude 32 north, longitude
144 west, where she encountered a
northeaster which lasted three days.
Four days after the gale had blown
itself out a nasty easterly sea pre
vailed.
Southerly winds with plenty of rain
followed until latitude 36.45 north,
longitude 131 west, was reached. Here
a snorting southeaster which lasted
forty-eight hours attacked the Gerard
C. Tobey, tumbling her about and test
ing to the limit every spar and timber
in her.
During the gale tne wind shifted
from the southeast to the southwest,
causing a heavy cross sea. Then came
a succession of rain squalls followed
by thunder and lightning, succeeded
by more rain.
At the height of the storm the
barometer registered 29.80.
Captain Scott reports that on Janu
ary 20, about fifteen miles off Cape
Mendocino, he spoke the barkentine
l!mgard, one of the trio that started
to race from Honolulu to this port.
The Irmgard has not yet put in an
appearance here.
Another sugar packet, the Metha
Nelson, Captain Lorentsen, arrived
yesterday, twenty-one days from
Mahukona. She brought 10,7 96 bags
of sugar.
City of Pnebla Very Late.
The Pacific Ooast Steamship Company's City
of Puebla. Captain Jepson, which was due
Monday from Puget Sound, did not reach port
until yesterday morning, twÂ«nty-four hours
late. The delay was caused in part by the
strong southerly winds, but the principal rea
ecm lor her tardiness wag the breaking down of
a circulating pump. I>uring the passage, on
bunday, Nels L. Faulk. a cabin passenger,
died of heart disease. He was 24 years old
and a native of Seattle. His home was at
Bailard.
Will Go to Yokohama.
Instead of carrying contraband to Vladivos
tok, or at least making the attempt, the Brit
ish steamer Brinkbum will probably leave here
In a few days for Yokohama, She will dis
charge all of her cargo but the barley, and
will load barley to take the place of the freight
discharged. Trading to Yokohama Is not so
profitable as blockade running, but with the
Mikado ruling the waves it is more than a
little safer.
Abydos Held at Buenos Aji^s.
Word was received at the Merchants' Ex
change yesterday from Buenos Ayres that the
Kosmos liner Abydos was being held at that
port pending the settlement of a claim of
$75,000 lor salvage. The ADydos left here for
Hamburg October 17. She went ashore at
Osorno Bay. Wreckers from Buenos Ayres
succeeded 1b floating her and towing her to
the Argentine port.
Overdue Halewood Is Safe.
The British ship Halewood, from Vancouver,
and which on Monday was placed on the over
due list, with reinsurance quoted at 10 per
cent, arrived yesterday at Callao, her destina
tion. She encountered bad weather, and if
ports having losit part of her deckload. The
vessels Â£1111 on the overdue list are quoted as
follows: Stork, 80 per cent; Robert Rlckmers,
90 per cent; Francois and Brodick Bay, 0 per
cent, and steamship Skldby. 55 per cent.
Gasoline Launch Goes Adrift.
A gasoline launch belonging to a local
butcher went adrift on Monday night from
her moorings off Fisherman's wharf. The run
away was picked up outside the Heads yes
terday morning by Domlnico Magllo, a fisher
man, who towed the wanderer home, and will
collect in salvage more than the profits of a
week's fishing.
Schooners Change Hands.
Two well-known schooners changed hands
yesterday. The Zarnpa of the Gardiner Mill
Company's fleet was sold to the Alaska Cod
fish Company, and the Joseph Russ was sold
by the Pacific Shipping Company to the Rob
ertson Fisheries Company of Anacortes.
Speaks Sealing Schooner.
The Epreckles tug Relief on Monday spoke the
sealing schooner San Diego off Point Reyes.
The schooner reported having taken twenty

rived yesterday, eleven days from Astoria,
has been off port since Saturday.
The steamship Maine has arrived at Durban
In a sinking condition. She reports having
struck hevily on Aliwal Shoals. Lighters have
been sent to take off the cargo. The extent
of the damage will not be known until the

of a survey being made.
The steapiehlp St. Paul, which, as stated
in The Call some weeks ago, had been eecuerd
by the Harriman lines for the San Francisco-
Portland run, will not enter that service until
May. She has been lying up In Oakland Creek,
and will be thoroughly overhauled before go-
Ing into commission.

Supervisors Direct Board
of Works Not to Violate
the One-Twelfth Clause
INVESTIGATION ENDED
Steps Are Taken to Prevent
More Deficits in Sewer
and Street Kepair Funds
The Supervisors' Finance Commit- !
tee yesterday resumed Its inquiry
into the violation of the one-twelfth
act in the expenditures by the Board
of Works for repairs to sewers and
basalt pavements, which resulted in a
deficit in the funds and the laying off
of a number of civil service laborers.
Bookkeeper Levy submitted a
statement showing the expenses for
teaming in cleaning and repairing
sewers during the first seven months
of the fiscal year 1904-T)5 were $17,
826 85, against $8916 95 for the same
period in 1903-04. The cost of team
ing In repairing basalt pavements for
seven months of 1904-05 was $9317 50
and 55396 50 in 1903-04.
Levy also filed a statement show
ing that $17,159 16 was expended for
emergency construction work in re- ,
pairing sewers. Of this amount
$8154 70 was for the break at the
foot of Fillmore street, $1807 54 for
the sewer on Fifteenth street, between
Castro and Noe, and $3298 70 for the
Army-street sewer.
The committee objected to an ex
pense of $450 incurred for improving
the road to the new pesthouse being
paid out of the basalt block repair
fund.
The committee decided to end the
investigation with a specific direction
to the Board of Works that it cease to
violate the one-twelfth clause of the
charter, which resulted in a deficit in
the funds. When cases of urgent and
extraordinary repairs to streets and
sewers occur then the Board of Works
must first consult with the Board of
Supervisors before taking any action.

To Whom It May Concern: After treat-
ing with the best physicians and specialists
for the past six . years I called on Dr.
Won i Him. He made a simple examina-
tion by feeling the pulse and explained my
case fully. I asked him If he could cure
it. He said yes, in from six to eight weeks,
which I can truthfully say he did. The
physicians here think him a wonder. Any
one writing me I will be only too glad and
thankful to answer. I can cheerfully rec-
ommend him In the very worst cases of
eczema, as my case was known to be one
of the most stubborn on record. The
X-ray was also a - failure. I think Dr.
Wong Him one of the best doctors In the
United States and owe my future health to
him. Very truly, â

HONOR TO WASHINGTON.
NO matter how great the national appreciation of worthies who
have lived nearer to our time, it is to be hoped that the anniver
sary of the birthday of Washington will always be permitted
to stand alone as the only national holiday observed in honor of an
American. As Lincoln is seen in increasing perspective, there will
grow a tendency to put him, inithis respect, in the company of
Washington. But the character of LirrcoÃi would gain no greatness
by the association. The anniversary of his birth is better left to
the voluntary sentiment of his countrymen, who increasingly express
their appreciation of his character and achievements. In the re
ception of such honors he stands alone, and it is doubtful if such
honors asf are paid to him now would be made larger by nationalizing
the day.
As all of his countrymen look back where the majestic figure
of Washington stands in our history, there is no suggestion of any
partisan division, oi feud or quarrel. The only sentiment appealed to
is patriotism. It was the judgment of his contemporaries, affirmed
by history, that the nation owes to him its existence. Leader in war
and in peace, he established by statesmanship and good example the
ireedom that he first won by the sword. Had any other, of less pa
tience and self-control, of less endurance and a lower range of prin
ciples, been at the head of the revolution, its success would have been
doubtful. Against him were pitted the experienced military men of
Great Britain, seasoned in many campaigns, with training and ex
perience in war far beyond his. Yet he wore them all out, by a per
sistence that refused to yield, and a patience that could wait for all
obstructions to pass and for opportunity to appear.
He had with him soldiers of great merit. Let all honor be
"' heirs. But among them there was not one who had the quality that
impels men to bear all reverses with philosophy, to accept defeat
without depression, and to put a proper and sober estimate, upon
victory as he possessed it. His wonderful spirit was the sustaining
influence of the colonists in the long struggle. If he had succumbed
to defeat and discouragement there would 'have been no L T nited
States, the republic would not have been, and he would have gone into
history, soon to be forgotten, as an unsuccessful rebel, and would
be now remembered only as one of a company of minor characters
who revolted against their king.
The whole issue depended upon his personality. There were
others who could see as far ahead as he, when the skies were clear.
But his foresight pierced the storm and the clouds, before which
others quailed and failed. He had an accurate knowledge of political
conditions in the Ministry and Parliament of England. His judg
ment of men reinforced his belief that persistence in the revolution
would finally wear out the Ministry and the people and King. He
knew the relation of British politics to the other countries of Eu
rope, and counted correctly upon results that would issue there
from. Weighing all of these considerations, his lofty spirit was the
Â«ole sustaining force that kept his countrymen in action, made them
bear the sorrows of a long war and made of raw lads and village
merchants the heroeÂ«= of a movement destined to more profoundly af
fect the welfare of the world than any other in human government.
It is certain that in his own time he had no peer in the qualities that
were required to win in the movement he led. And it is certain
that his country had not yet produced his equal, who, put under the
same stress and trial, could have borne all and won all as he did. It i
is also certain Â£hat prior to his time men had never known such a
leader, as brave, patient, far sighted, impervious to defeat and dis
courag nent. as proof against envy and jealousy, as unselfish and
devoted.
It is for these reasons that his name is acclaimed all over the
world. His place in history is unique. He stands alone as a creative \
soldier and administrator. He made war without expressing per- '
sonal disrespect for his enemy, and made peace to enter upon the !
construction of a government out of material that had known only
colonial subjection, and was uninformed in all the processes of free j
government under popular institutions. His example formed this I
raw material into a nation. The slightest manifestation of selfishness
on his part would have thrown the whole scheme into chaos and re- â 
volt. But his self-restraint set the pace. He served his country in
war without money reward, and in peace without emolument. The j
young republic, with its limited industries disordered by war, its \
finances in confusion, its fiscal unorganized, gained no burdens from ;
him. He put his great patience and capacity into composing the ;
people and encouraging them to bear their new responsibilities. I
Duty was his first thought, the consciousness of its discharge was i
Ims sole reward.
It is doubtful if the generation in which he lived and wrought j
appreciated him as thoroughly as we appreciate him. after more than â¢
a century has shown forth the results of his perfect work. He
pave the nation its right impulse, without which it would not have j
survived the first decade. Around him raged the storms of rival theo
ries and competitive ambitions. He was not partisan to any in his
cowfoct of the Government, and while he lived it was found im
possible for the country to divide into political parties. So strong
a hold had his example taken upon his countrymen that they looked I
to his guidance alone. Of course he had critics among them, and i
they said unjust things, but these are forgotten. The luster of bis '
name has extinguished them as a great light drives out the shadows.
Let him stand in honor serenely alone, an example to every race and !
land. I
REPORT ON THE SENATORS.
THE report of the committee of investig^m of the four ac
cused Senators finds them guilty as charJÃi and recommends
their expulsion from the Senate. It is difficult to see^how any
other action could have been taken. The Senate committee can act
upon evidence that might be excluded in a court of law, in order
that it may purge itself. In view of the technical fight made on
demurrer by the accused Senators, it may be that expulsion from the
Senate is the only punishment that can be visited upon them Men
in their position should not rely on a technical defense, provided they
are innocent. They hare all the resources of evidence in a criminal
court. They can testify each for himself and each for the others.
They can offer proof of alibi, and indeed they have a quiverful of
defensive evidence, provided they are innocent.
The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the law assumes
their innocence until they are proven guilty. Under such circum
stances a resort to technicalities does not improve their case in public
estimation. The Senate m this situation owes to itself and the pub
lic the duty of acting upon the facts that are before it and upon the
evidence it has secured. We know that it is not an agreeable duty
but Senators are in a representative capacity and cannot be con
trolled by the sentimental side of such an issue. The people have
read the testimony and agree with the findings of the committee
An attempt is made to develop an analogy between the cases
rSC 7â¢ u e ,, Se " atoi \ and United States Senators Dietrich,
â m and Mitchell. But there is no analogy. The three United
Mates Senators were charged with acts outside the Senate, which
had nothing to do with its proceedings or with their votes or any
measure to come before it. The United States Senate did not take
jurisdiction of their cases at all. It made no investigation, and it is
doubtful whether it had authority to make any. At Sacramento the
rase is entirely different. The offense charged is acceptance of a
bribe to affect the action of its recipients as Senators, their votes as
and their reports to be made as members of a Senate committee
in matters of which they took -jurisdiction. The lack of analogy is
complete. The United States Senate awaits the decision of 'the
criminal courts before determining whether its accused members
are to retain their seats. The State Senate must act independently
the criminal courts, for the offense charged was committed against
its purity and dignity.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1905.
TO THE VICTOR BELONGS
THE SPOILS.
WHEN I yet Phyllis alone in
the conservatory I promptly
proposed to her again. Fact
is, I wouldn't have come to
the ball at all if It hadn't
j been that I Intended to try again to
: win her.
"Jack," said Phyllis demurely. "I
wish you would bring me a drink of
water. Dancing always makes me ao
I thirsty."
Phyllis has changed the subject
; every time Just about the same way.
I knew there was no use arguing; so i
I went for the water. Only I brought
lemonade instead.
But when a fellow comes back with I
the lemonade after such an incident j
as that and finds another chap hold- |
ing: the lady's hand and his other arm j
hovering suspiciously along the back
o' the chair, I think he should feel
1 Jolly well sore. I know I did. As for
Joe Hadden, he looked bored when I
came in and half swore.
"1 beg pardon," said I. "If I'm
intruding â "
Phyllis' eyes twinkled, and I knew
she was laughing at me.
Just then Dawcy Graham came in.
i "This one is ours, Phyllis," said he,
; holding up his card. "The third
waltz, you know."
"Thank you. Jack," said Phyllis, as
she drank the lemonade.
I went down to the smoking room
i fcr a cigarette to steady my nerves. I
I don't know, and, for that mater, don't
I care, what Joe did.
However, I had the better of him,
1 for I took Phyllis in to supper.
'Accept him, Phyllis," I growled
surlily.
"Not yet," said Phyllis.
"Going I questioned in the
same tone.
Phyllis' brows met in a perplexed
frown. She appeared to be pondering
the problem very deeply.
"I've thought of the way to settle it
between you," she condescended to
i reply at length. "To-morrow morn
ing I'm going up to Grovehurst Hall,
j and you and Joe are to run a race up
there in your autos. The one who
gets there first â will â will win the I
race," finished Phyllis lamely.
I knew what that meant. If Had
i don't touring car wouldn't be able to
beat my dinky little runabout it would
'â  be because he had a break down. I
supposed I must have looked what I
; thought, for Phyllis looked at me m
i quiringly.
"Well," she questioned primly,
1 "what is it now? Don't you think it
is worth your while to enter that
race?"
"The prize is worth it, Phyllis," said
I, looking straight into her eyes.
Phyllis blushed the sweetest rosy red.
"But do you think the conditions are
exactly fair?"
Phyllis" eyes twinkled.
"No," she said, "I don't; but. you
know, beggars can't be choosers."
That settled it. I would make the
run, anyhow.
"Will there be a booby prize award
ed?" I asked.
Phyllis shook her head. I was
seized with a bright idea.
"You said you were going over J
yourself," I ventured. "I ought at
I least to have a consolation prize.
\ Will you make the trip with me?"
Phyllis looked grave.
"I'm afraid it will look like favor
itism," said Phyllis; "but I guess I
can."
"Thanks," I said. "With a good
mascot, I'll stand a better show."
"Am I a good mascot?" asked
Phyllis.
"May I never have a better," I re
plied devoutly. "I'm willing to take
chances on you for a good deal more
than a motor race."
Phyllis liked that. Really, I feel as
if I were Quite clever at times. Then
she took the wind all out of me again.
A MISAPPLIED PETITION.
Not long since the choir in one of the
fashionable churches of the South ren
dered a long and difficult anthem â one
with many frills and furbelows. The
good minister sat patiently through it,
but when the anthem was finished he
arose and, to the amusement of both
congregation and choir, began his
prayer in deeply earnest tones, saying,
"O Lord, we thank Thee that we are
still alive!" â February Lippincott's.
"HOME CHIMES."
The February number of "Home
Chimes," a monthly magazine pub
lished in Berkeley, "a center of the

There was an auto behind ns.
'-
"The race will decid* that," said
she briefly.
If the way I fixed that runabout up
for the run had anything to do with
it, I felt sure I ought to stand a chance
at least. I got a repair man to look it
over, and then, after he was done, I
went over it myself and tapped every
nut and bolt. As I was coming home
I saw Joe Haddon driving down the
river road.
"All ready!" said Phyllis, as the
clock struck nine the next morning.
And in a moment we had started the
twenty miles. We hustled down the

ITALY'S WATCHFUL KING.
A good story is told of the King of
Italy's zeal for efficiency at the time of
his succession to the throne. His for
eign minister, Signor Prinetti, asked
him to sign a decree for the augmenta
tion of the foreign-office staff. The
King promised to think the matter
over, and the next morning set out
alone on foot to pay a visit to the
office. Arriving at nine o'clock, he
found no one there. A long search un
earthed a solitary clerk who was smok
ing cigarettes. "What are the hours of
this office?" asked the King. "From
eight to twelve," was the reply. "And
when may I expect to see your col
leagues?" "They generally turn up at
eleven." "Very well. When your chief
comes, tell him that I have been here."
And then his Majesty sent for Signor
Prinetti and suggested that instead of
asking for more clerks he should make
it his business to see that the existing
clerks attended to their duties.âLes

BALLAD OF THE ICE.
A little dish of broken ice
Lay basking in the sun,
Its owner had forgotten it
Before her work was done;
But when she went to get the ice
And bring it in to tea,
She found the ice was not what it
Had been cracked up to be.

wasn't a bit nervous at the hare
brained pace.
"Too fast. Phyllis," I questioned.
"Just a little," she replied.
I pulled the lever open another
notch, and we could actually feel the
machine take a fresh jump forward.
Phyllis clutched my arm.
"Oh!" she cried, with a terrified lit
tle scream. "I meant to go slower."
"Can't do "ft." I replied, grimly.
There's too much at stake on this
race."
Phyllis looked at me from the tall
of her eye.
"If we have a spill we'll be half
killed," she pouted.
"I'd have demonstrated my good
faith, anyhow," I retorted. "You'd
know I'd done my best."
The runabout hit a stone that lay
at the side of the road, and I'm cer
tain the front wheel traveled fifty feet
before it hit the dust again.
"Oh!" gasped Phyllis again. "Do
be careful. Jack, or we'll be killed.
The machine was already going its
limit or I would have opened it some
more. I made the pretense of putting
on more speed.. I was having my
revenge.
"I'm being careful," I said as well
ias I could for the wind, "but I've
simply got to make it. Do you see Joe
behind us?"
Phyllis could not see him.
"There are no auto tracks ahead," I
observed; "if he's anywhere he must
be back of us."
I sized up the track ahead and turn
ed to look back. There was an auto
behind us!
"Phyllis," I murmured reproach
fully, "you said you couldn't see any
one. '
"That's not Joe," said Phyllis with
conviction.
"How do you know?" I asked. "It's
a yellow car, and his is the only yel
low touring car around here."
"I don't care," persisted Phyllis; i
"it's not Joe Haddon, so there."
"We'll take no chances," I said, !
maliciously. "It may be; you weren't j
even able to see an auto when you j
looked the first time."
"Do you think I'm deliberately ly
ing to help Joe?" asked Phyllis. I
Icily.
"No," I answered, "but the issue is ;
too important to trust to such poor :
eyesight."
'You goose!" said Phyllis, irrever- j
ently.
The puff-puff of the big machine
was close behind us now, and I would
have given worlds to have looked
around and to see who was in it; but
the risk was too great. Another mile i
and we would be at the hall. So long 'â 
as I kept the middle of the path the !
big car could not pass us. I deter- i
mined to keep it.
"Get over," shouted a hoarse voice j
behind us. "That's not fair play."
"All's fair in war. and â " I said it !
low and left the sentence unfinished, i
Phyllis heard it, and I felt her small !
gloved hand rest ever so lightly on
my arm.
"Go it," she urged.
As we swung through the hall
gates and ran up the broad avenue
the touring car passed us. It con
tained only Dawcy Graham!
I slowed down.
"Phyllis," I said, "did you know
all the time it was Dawcy?"
Phyllis nodded.
"And where's Joe?" I demanded.
"I don't know." replied "Phyllis, i
"I told him 'No* last night."
"And what made Dawcy follow us?" I
I persisted, still unsatisfied.
"I thought it would add a little to !
the excitement of the chase," said ;
Phyllis, nestling into the hollow of '
my arm, "if he were to borrow the j
machine and come, too. Don't you
think it did?"
But it didn't matter what I thought.
"If you hadn't been perfectly blind,
you'd have guessed it last night," said
she.

ENGINEER HERE
V. G. Bogue, Famous Ball

of the Western Pacific
"i.X to \\\: nri:im:n

and This city Reacted in
Less Than Three Years
V. G. sup. consulting engineer for j
<ieorge J. Gould, widely known as one I
of the 'world's greatest engineers, is at :
ihe St. Francis. !
Mr. Bogue was chief engineer of the 1
Union Pacific Railroad and it was he '
who reconstructed that line. He also '
built the Oregon Short Line.
Of late years, he has had his office '
in New York, where he has acted as '
consulting engineer of the Gould in- j
terests. *
In addition to his many other im- â¢
portant duties, Bogue is the consult-;
ing engineer of the Western Mary- !
land road, which Gould is completing i
from Pittsburg to Baltimore, where an ;
extensive Atlantic terminal is under
construction. The Western Maryland '
connects with Gould's Wheeling and
Lake Erie road at Pittsburg. The
Wheeling and Lake Erie connects with
l Mould's Wabash road at Toledo. Ohio. \
The Wabash intersects the Missouri
Pacific, another Gould line, at St. '
Louis. From St. Louis the Iron Moun
tain and other Gould lines extend to j
the Guif pacts. The Missouri Pacific
extends from St. Louis to Colorado,
where it joins the Denver and-Rio *
Grande, a Gould line, which extends
from Denver to Salt Lake City.
The Western Pacific is to extend
from Salt Lake City to San Francisco.
Ml i II PATIENT WORK. I
Mr. EM is not an officer of the,
"Western Pacific. He is here as the
Â«< >nsultlng engineer of Eastern capi- ',
talists who are interested in that comp
any. He represented them for some
time in the preliminaries and engin- j
eetins questions that must be taken -
up in advance of construction.
in building the Western Pacific, i
much time was consumed in the sur- !
veys and other engineering, especially
Â« here such a range of mountains as
The Sierra Nevada must be crossed.
This work is about concluded, and
construction will shortly begin on an
extensive scale and will be pushed to
rapid completion. It is intended to ;
have the road ooen from Salt Lake
City to San Francisco within two and
one-half years.
The capitalists interested in the
Western Pacific will not have national
aid. It must build across the deserts
and mountains, which are to a large
xtÂ«=-nt barren of traffic. The projec- '
tors see in the rapid growth of Cali- ,
f ornia and the Pacific coast and in the j
immense Oriental and island trade j
abundant opportunity for the road and
for a reasonable return upon the in- â 
vestment required. Mr. Bogue said:

r*ct mch liberal treatment In the matter of <

M well as beneficial to the communities ]
through which it will pass.
Mr. Bogue said he had had contrac- j
tors look over much of the line and ;
would shortly obtain bids for grading, j
track-laying and other work.
-The Western Pacific is an Independ- '
eni enterprise, and it has expended a."
large sum in preliminaries and in the
purchase of properties. It will have j
such traffic relations as will make it a
factor of vast importance to the whole '
coast. It is believed that the improve- I
ment and growth that it will bring will
more than compensate for any loss it j
will cause existing roads. ]

THINKS DURAND
IS A BIGAMIST
Stockton Man Threatens His
Runaway' Wife and She in
Turn Makes Grave Charge
EVIDENCE IN A LETTER
Woman Says Epistle Shows
That He Has Family in
Tl a infield, New Jersey
Because she had evidence to show
that her husband was a Bluebeard or
a Hoch, Mrs. Delia Durand of Stock
ton tried to hide from him in this city.
Because Louis Durand was madly in
fatuated with the woman who seeks
to evade him he followed her here
and. finding her at 328 Eddy street
yesterday, threatened to kill her if she
did not come back to him.
From facts gathered by the police
she is the third wife of Durand and
the two others still claim the right to
call him husband.
"I cannot live without you," he de
clared. "You must come back to me.
If you do not I will kill you."
Realizing that the look in the man's
eyes meant murder, and recalling the
accounts of Hoch's escapades, Mrs.
Durand summoned all her faculties
and placated the frenzied man. She
promised to do as he wished, but as
soon as he left the house she hurried
to the Central police station and swore
to a warrant charging her husband
with threatening her life.
The woman became Mrs. Delia Du
rand in May. 1903. at Syracuse, N. Y.
Shortly after the wedding the couple
went to Stockton, where Durand be
< ame foreman of the Globe Iron
Works. The husband said that he had
a crippled child by a former wife who
had died. He had to send monthly re
mittances for the little one's suppor'.
to Plainfield, N. J.
When Mis. Durand the second
pressed inquiries about the little one,
Durand gave evasive answers. On*
day a letter from Plainfield came to
the home of the Durands and the wife
opened it. In it she declares was re
vealed the fact that her husband had
another wife and four children.
Then she fled from him and came to
this city to hide, she says. The infat
uated iron worker informed the Chief
of Police of Stockton that he would
either kill her or bring her back. The
officer sent word to the woman, telling
her of the threat, and she was pre
pared for his coming.
The man was somewhat under the
influence of liquor when he burst upon
Mrs. Durand. and she was certain that
he would have carried out his murder
ous threat had she not "bluffed" him.
On arrest he admitted that he had
bought a revolver, but refused to tell
the police where it was hidden. To
Detective Bailey he declared that h<i
had a wife in Philadelphia.
Last night Dnrard told a different
story. He claimed that he had met
his latest wife at Victoria and desig
nates her as the "notorious Mrs. Bella
WÂ» stwood. ' He dccl&red most em
phatically that he did not have any
other wife living. "I had been drink
ing," he said, "or I /would not have
made such a fool of myself.
4 The only time I threatened my wife
was when she left me to "go with an
other man. Then I told her I troaTd
get even If God spared me."
The woman curtly declined to be in
terviewed last night. Phe seemed to
be <>n the verge of nervous prostra
tion.

PADRES CHANT
NUPTIAL MASS
IN OLD MISSION
SANTA BARBARA, Feb. 21.-The
wedding of Miss Alice Bacon and
Thomas Driscoll, the wealthy San
Francisco clubman and polo expert, in
the old Mission to-day at 11 o'clock
was the smartest social affair, and the
most impressive this city has seen for
many months.
A few minutes before 11 o'clock the
wedding chimes of the old Mission
rang out their glad messages, hasten
ing the arrival of the many guests who
came to this city frum all parts of the
State to attend the wedding. The
groom was the first of the bridal party
to reach the church. The bride was
accompanied by her father, Pay Di
rector Albert W. Bacon, United States
Navy, retired, her mother and her
maid of honor, Miss Cornelia Kempff,
daughter of Rear Admiral Kempff. As
the bridal party entered the church
Miss Bacon was supported by her
father. Just within the entrance the
bride was met by the groom, who led
her*to the altar while the strains of
Lohengrin filled the church. The
bridesmaids were Miss Eleanor Phelps
and Miss Catherine Kutz, daughters of
naval officers.
The bride was gowned in white silk
with a long train overhung with rare
lace. She carried bride's roses, and at
her throat sparkled a diamond and
pearl brooch, a wedding gift from the
groom.
The groom was assisted by Edward
J. Tobin, a college mate and his in
separable friend. The ushere were
James K. Moftitt, Richard N. Tobln,
Thomas If. Kennedy and Neal Power
of San Francisco.
The wedding ceremony was Impres
sively performed by Hie Grace Arch
bishop P. W. Riordan of the diocese of
San Francisco, assisted by Father P.
K. Mulligan of San Francisco, Father
S. M. Sweeney of Oakland and Father
Gleason, and by Father Glauber, su
perior of the old Mission. A nuptial
mass followed, the monks chanting the
service from the ancient choirloft.
At the conclusion of the church ser
vice a reception was held and a wed
ding breakfast served at the Bacon
home.
From here Mr. and Mfs. Driscoll will
go to Los Angeles, thence to New York
and Washington. After attending the
President's inauguration they will sail
o-n a tour of indefinite length through
Europe. An automobile trip through
southern France is among their plans.

NATIVES DANCE
EVENING AWAY
Brilliant Assemblage at An
niversary Ball of Members
of Stanford Parlor No. 76
TASTEFUL DECORATIONS
One of the Most Gala
Functions Ever Given by
Sons of the Golden West
Native Sons' Hall was last night
a scene of brilliancy that has not at
any time been surpassed therein in
any social function during the present
winter season. The occasion was the
nineteenth anniversary invitation par
ty given by Stanford Parlor No. 76,
Native Sons of the Golden West. In
the past this parlor has been noted
for the pretty effects at its social
functions, and the decorations of last
evening were not only along the line
of previous efforts, but far surpassed
any. The color scheme was white,
tule and fish net, relieved with silver
bullion, and as an offset there was a
lavish festooning of pale blue, while
the center piece was a dream of white
with small garlands of delicate flow
ers. The floor was crowded with
dancers, the ladies in full evening
gowns, the brightest conception of
the dressmaker's art, while the gen
tlemen were all in conventional ball
room attire. The members of the
several v committees were distinguished
by each wearing a broad ribbon sash
in lieu of a badge. The effect of
those who joined in the grand march
under the subdued lights and in the
shadow of the magnificent decora
tions was one that was most pleasing
to the eye, and the brilliancy o{ the
affair will long linger in the memory
of the many who were in the galleries
as well as those on the floor.
Those who had this affair in hand
were :
Floor director, T. I. Fltzpatrick.
Assistant floor director, Leo J. McMahon.
Floor committee â Henry A. Cahalan, Thomas
P. Grennan. Charles A. Moraghan. Robert
Sehord George W. Springer, David B. Torres,

DAVID BISPHAM
SHOWS TALENT
IN MANY SONGS
David Bispham delighted a large
audience at Lyric Hall last night with
a repertoire that was as varied as it
was interesting. The artist's well
rounded and powerful barytone was
never heard to better advantage and
the plaudits of his auditors proved
his concert a pronounced success. He
sang a score of collections, gay, humor
ous and dramatic, and in all of them
he was perfectly at home. The faint
est presence of huskiness due to a
slight cough was powerless to affect
the magnificent quality of his voice,
which rang true and vibrant in each of
his well-selected numbers.
The full power of Bispham's vocal
organs was perhaps more particularly
delineated in "The Evening Star," from
Tannhauser. The exquisite manner of
its rendition held the audience almost
breathless. The prologue from "Pag
liacci" demonstrated in a marked de
gree the character of his vocal tech
nique, while his faultless interpretation
of "Alberich's Curse" by Wagner ex
hibited his admirable dramatic train
ing.
Among his numbers in a lighter vein
was "My Lady Sweet, Arise," which
was sung with tenderness, pleasing
and impressive, and it well earned for
him the laurel wreath presented him
by an admirer. "O Ruddier Than the
Cherry" by Handel, and "The Pretty
Creature," an old English song, pleased
th<* audience immensely, as did "The
Page's Song" from Falstaff. which
Bispham himself announced was quite
a contrast to others of his collection.
Kipling's "Danny Deever" and Burns'
"Killycrankie" concluded a programme
which was designed to please the most
fastidious. Harold Smith was a most
efficient accompanist.

REES WILL SUE
FRIEND GIGNOUX
Eccentric New Yorker Says
He Will Have Revenge on
Man "Who Caused His Arrest
ALSO AFTER GARDNER
Threatens Action Against
Head of Sanitarium for
'Keeping Him Restrained
Howell Caradoc Rees, the eccentric
young New York clubman, who es
caped late Monday night from a pri
vate sanitarium at Belmont and la
ter returned to this city, after a long
overland trip, was about town yester
day trying to renew old acquaintances.
His efforts to be sociable, however,
proved anything but encouraging, al
though he did find a few who listened
to his threats of what he proposes to
do with those who were responsible
for having him arrested and kept in
confinement.
Rees announced that he may sue
his former friend, R. M. Gignoux, who
caused his arrest for threatening his
life, f<*r slander, in charging that he
(Rees) is insane, and he said he would
also bring suit against Dr. Gardner for
keeping him in restraint. Inquiry at
the sanitarium last evening brought
the response that under no circum
stances would Rees be taken back
there, for he is regarded by the at
tendants as a hopeless case and de
serving of the Immediate care of hrs
relatives.
FRANK DELBARTO *XSUND
SUFFOCATED WITH GAS
Ills Wife Insists That He Was Mur
dered, but There Is No Evidence
of That Fact.
Frank Delbarto, a retail fruit dealer,
was found dead in his bed yesterday
in his room at 2985 Clay Btreet. The
key of the gas burner was open and
the room was filled with the poison
ous fumes.
Delbarto's wife, who had occupied
a separate room, informed Deputy
Coroner Charles Meehan that she
thought he had been murdered. In
vestigation by Detective Edward Gib
son showed that there was no basis
for such a theory. Delbarto was in
partnership with L. Gotelli and they
had not agreed. About a week ago
Mrs. Delbarto applied at the Hall of
Justice for a warrant for the arrest of
Gotelli, whom she accused of having
disturbed her peace by calling her
vile names. It was found that Gotelli
was sick in bed under care of a doc
tor and the warrant was not issued.

The Weatiter and Crops.
* The weekly report of A. G. McAdie. section
director of the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau, is as -follows:
GENERAL .SUMMARY.
Generally clear, cool and frosty weather pre
vailed at the beginning ot the week, followed
by higher temperature and heavy rains in all
â¢actions, continuing until near the. close of
the week. The rain caused some damage to
crops, but was of lncalculahJfe benefit in the |
touthern sections. Reports from Southern i
California concerning the heavy frost of the
13th are to the effect that tender vegetation
an<l young citrus trees were quite Â»erioutly
injured, but oranges and lemons were not
damaged. Very little damage was done else
wbert to- early deciduous fruits.
The continued cool weather and rains have i
retarded the growth of grain and feed to some
Â«xtect and caused a suspension of farm work, â 
though plowing and seeding were resumed In j
fccme sections. Early grain is in very fair i
condition in most daces, but the late sown
hae not made much growth. The acreace in '
train is reported far in excess of last season's .
and proejiects for large crops of wheat, oats J
fend barley are better than for several years.
Al'alfa' it. making food growth and a heavy
uop is expected. Green feed is plentiful in
all sections and cattle are in excellent con- (
<Utlon.
Almond*., peaches and apricots are in full
bloom in many places and the outlook is good
for iarse -itojis of ail deciduous fruits. The
heavy trotsU damaged almonds, in some se<-
titirs. but the loss will not be serious. Prun- i
ing is nearly <<jtniiletÂ«-d and vineyard cultiva- j
tion is progressing.
SACRAMK.NT.J VALLEY.â CIear and cold
weather continued during th* first part of
the week, with drying' north winds and severe
Irofts. followed by wanner weather and rain. :
which prevailed at \ t close. In some sec-,
tions the irofcts qilite Bcrldusly Injured almonds
end early vegetables and checked the. growth i
of grain anil feed. Early sown grain is in j
very good condition except on some of the
low lands, where the m>ll is too wet. Late
sewn gram iias not made much growth, but
iÂ«s In fair condition. The acreage in train in !
*<;me sections is reported 50 per cent greater j
; ! a:, la.-i season's, and the prospect for large !
crops wa's nevtr better. Work in hop fields
is backward on account of the continued rains. i
Almonds, . ai-h*Â» an aprioots are in full
bloom, i'runlng is completed in some sections-.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â CIear and
Irofcty weather, .prevailed . at th. beginning of
the wctk, followed .by generous rains and
warm, favorable weather... The rainfall for the
week ;i . â¢ ritÂ£>-o .over one inch and was very
li'-refloial in the southern districts. Plowing
anJ seeding were again suspended in the cen
tra) and northern' sections, liarly sown grain j
i* in exretlrr.t condition and making fair 1
t:i>;wih. Barley is two feet high in nan Luis!
ObjÂ»iÂ»<> County. Crop prospects in ail t-ections
arr more than Uyually good and the acreage
in grain arid hay is above the average. Green
fee<i is plentiful and stook Is in good condi- '
tion. Deciduous fruit prospects are excellent,
the frosie having caused no material damage.
Kerly fruit trees are in bloom in many places.
Pruning is nearly completed.
SA"N JOAQUIN VALLEY.â Partly cloudy, j
warm weather. . with frequent showers, pre- !
va'.lrd during the past week. These conditions I
were favorable for all growing crops, trees
and vines. Grain has inaae rapid growth and 1
>Â» in excellent condition. In sjme sections
fcetding continues and the acreage will be
larger than for several years. Green feed is
plentiful and etock is healthy and in Kcod
condition. Pruning and cultivating onchards
and vineyards continues. Fruit buds are :
swelling rapidly. Large hay shipments con
tUnie to Southern California and Arizona. i
Severe frost occurred the â m part of the
Week, but no damage is reported.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. The brier i
'period of â¢Id weather at the close of the
preceding week was followed by higher tern- j
perature and heavy rains, which continued '
until near the close of the week. The fol
lowing st^sonal rainfalls are reported:* Po
way, 13.31 inche?; Upland, 15.1t* inches: Los
At.geles. 12.15 inchee; San Diego. 10.23 Inches. j
During the present month the rainfall at '
Pcway has been 7.C2 inches and at han Diego
5.53 inches the greatest amount for February 1
since â The heavy rains have caused
come damage, but will result in great good Â» to ;
all farming interests. Early rain is in good
condition and growing rapidly. Plowing and
â eedlng are progressing. The only definite
report of the severe frost of last Monday is
frcm Upland, where tender plants were killed,
but oranges and lemons were not injured.
â¢EUREKA SUMMARY.â PIowing and seed-
Ing are being rushed and many farmers have
this work finished. Gardening is progressing
favorably. Feea has such good growth that
only the â oat severe frosts can do It any
material damage. Some fruit trees are being
pruned.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Reports state
that careful .investigation falls to show Injury
to c'tnn "fruits or trees by the late cold snap:
only young growth and tender vegetation were
hurt.

NEW YORK. Feb. 21.â operations In
to-day'Â« Â«tock market were of a character to
ercfcuxase the hope, long deferred, of an active
entry Into the market of the public at larjje.
Thi; principal share In the market hitherto
has been attributed to professional operator*.
The success which has attended these opera
tions it of course based on a general confi
dence In th* prosperity of general conditions
â nd ' a confident investment demand, vhich
buttresses the market by a waiting demand
on' nil rt-ft-tt-ions. But the hope of fie pro
fertionnl coctincent which ha* been Dooming
Etovkg bas looked longingly forward to an
outbreak .of speculation of a much wider
Â»cone than is involved in such operations as
fiese. and which Is -en but once or twice
In a generation. Such a movement has al
ready occurred in this generation and it cul
minated in the panic of May. 1901. The un
fortunate j; -ue of that experience brouvht
-f-vcrÂ°. puuy'-meot that seemed to rer.'e an a
v.arr.irip to t^(. hole public and to discourage
tbeii- attempt to obtain any share In th*
benefit* of the - long advance which ha* sje
r-i -red In tfce â¢ â  sent stock market. â  Tbe Â«>
!ii-!rxt for Â«:ocks from this noting vp to this
time -lias teon entirely Inconspicuous, but Â«-vi
, ,-,,es : were ncmistakable to-day that the
putllc was coming freely into the market.
Tl-e tide of th.c buying demand had all of
t'iÂ» ij-rreasive sweep of periods of -widpspreaj
speculation and the movements were charac
ter'rtlcal'.y iacKlnf In special nÂ«trÃ to explain
ttiern TbÂ« only news that . see-nod to be re-
Ki.'ded was an advance in prices. Wh*ncver
fjls occurred it was pure to be follows quickly
by a rurgtor <setnat>d which chared up the
uut'xular etock affected Into violent activity
aid buoyancy. Ail news was favorably In
tp-rrcted or If ' haÂ» was not feasible was
ii-noati 1 . ' Union Pacific was the sensation ; of
the .rket and vu carried irre*!^t:Â»)iy to a
rcc-ord price level. The previous record . of
133 vÂ«tÂ« touched In May. 1001, iurln.r the
r*rind or buying, of the stock In retaliation
f;r the campaign â¢by Its owners for contril
cf J-'ortiiera Pacific. 1 Infarmatior. from vrell
lurormÂ»Ml Bources precluded thÂ» idea that asy
thic? like â¢>. ccrner in the et<vk nraÂ» threitenei
Eaually -well Informed authorities .deprecated
the talk that any plan was In progress look
inK to a change In the status of the company.
Banking interests near to the company were
authority for the opinion that the movement
vi" a* purely due to speculation in the stocK.
An even more violent price movement was
that in Plots-Sheffield Steel, which was
jumped up over 20 points. Rumors â¼â¢â¢ere
plentiful of a coming merger of Southern Iron
companies. Storm blockades and holding ot
cotton are forcing down the earnings of rail
made in the Southwest, but that group was
conspicuous for strength in the day's move
ment. The reported abandonment of railroad
rate legislation for this session of Concrete,
thÂ« hope that the New Haven labor trouble
Is to be arbitrated and the bel that the
war of . rates on export grain will soon be
terminated were minor influences in keeping
up the demand. But the other overriding
factor wag the growth and spread of specu
lative excitement, which brings increasing
crowds of buyers Into the market. Buying of
this character, without a reason why, swept
prices Irresistibly to a higher level. That
advantage was taken of the advent of public
buying to secure profits on an enormous scale
was evident from the occasional unsettlement
of the market. The closing itself was ir
regular, but the general character of the day
highly speculative market was not altered by
this fact.
Bonds were steady, but were not so active
a* stocks. Total sale?, par value, $r..i>35.000.
United Slates bonds were all unchanged on
tall.

CHICAGO BOAlil> OF TRADE.
â¢ Future; Grain and Provisions.
. CHICAGO. Feb. 21.â Strength In the wheat
market developed sunn after the opening. â¢â  At
the start the market was bearishly " affected
by ] a i decline at Liverpool I said â¢ to - be j caused i
by larger â  offerings from Argentina,. Initial
quotations on May were unchanged to %c low
er at $1 18% to $1 18%. July also was un
changed to lie lower at $1 01% to ?1 01%.
Trading was confined largely â¢ to ; the July, de
livery,; although some shorts ' covered May on
all slight declines. The demand for July at
times was of such a character as to ; suggest
that the market was receiving support from a
prominent . bull trader. Ah the session ad- ;
vanced wheat became more bullish. - Little 'â 
improvement, however, was noted In the ; vol- j
ume of ' business. Marked falling off ;In prL- i
mary receipts had a strengthening Influence
during the last part of the day. - Strength of
corn helped to stimulate demand for ' wheat."
Statistics of the world's visible supply .proved
a disappointment to the bulls. ; Prices, how
ever, reached the highest point of the day just>
before the close. May sold at $1 19% arur
July at 01%. The market finished : strot^
with May at the top, $1 19%. r Final quota
tions on July were at $1 0194@l 01%.
Shorts were fairly active bidders for corn
and In consequence' the market gained In :
strength as : trading progressed. The market
closed practically at. the highest point of the
day. U May opened unchanged to a shade higher
at 4(;Vi<S4Â«%c. sold up to 47c and â¢ closed ,
at 40% c
. firm undertone prevailed in the oats mar- j
ket the entire day. May opened : unchanged at .
30% c and closed at 31 1ie. .... ; -
Early, in the session an easy tone was man
ifested in provisions owing to selling by com- '
mission house*, and later, as ; a â¢ result ' of the i
strength :of corn, shorts covered moderately. ";
causing a firmer undertone. At the clc#e May j
pork" was up 6c lard was up 2%Â§oc. and ribs
were unchanged. =.

Wyman forged the name of S. H.
Mann on the precinct roster within
half an hour after he had written his
own name and voted his one legal
ballot. Only six names intervene be
tween his genuine signature and the
telltale script that spelled the name
citizen who had not yet come to
the polls.
Steftens voted the name of C. A.
Crew besides his own and his crime
v. h* no less flagrant than Wyman's.
The Grand Jury reasons that the elec
tion board ought to ha\ie been aware
that the honesty of the ballot box was
being violated and the testimony the
officers gave at the trials of Wyman
and .Steffens. evasive and much con
fused, encourages the inquisitors to
take up an inquiry with a view to
gathering in more of the stuffing gang.
S. H. Mann, whose name was voted
by Wyman; Fairfax H. Wheelan. who
n eye-witness to the crimes com
mitted by the two men now under
pentenoe of three years, and Special
Policeman Doyle, also an eye-witness,
were before the jurors yesterday.
They went over again the story of the
high-handed proceedings of the gang
-.< primary booth on August 9.
A question arises, however, in view
of the Supreme Court decision of day
before yesterday whether prosecution
of the precinct officers could be ef
fective. They all gave testimony be
fore the former Grand Jury and this
fart, it appears, can be successfully
â¢ uted ;n defense. The theory of
the law is that it is more important
to elect public officers honestly than
ta runish one who violates the elec
tion laws, and better to let a wrong
doer go free if he will give testimony
showing that a candidate has won an
office dishonestly and is not entitled
to it.
C. C. Volberg and F. R. Maliett
were also called before the Grand
Jury yesterday ir. further effort to
learn if it has not been a practice of
building and loan corporations in the
past to contribute to a fund used for
corruption at Sacramento. No evi
dence of a tangible character was
brought out, however. Nothing more
than surmises were collected from the
witnesses.

Police Are Searching for
Alfred Kerbacker, Wanted
on Grand Larceny Charge
ROBS EMPLOYER'S SAFE
Graduate of a University
in Paris, France, and Comes
Here Higlilyltecomnieiided
The police are searching for Alfred
Kerbacker, who is wanted to answer
to a charge of grand larceny. A war
rant was sworn out yesterday morn
ing for his arrest. The complaining
witness is If. F. Hrubanik, manager
of the Western Wire Works, 751 Mis
sion street, and the amount alleged irj
the complaint to have been Btolen is
$120.
Kerbacker is twenty-five years of age
and a graduate of the leading univers
ity of Paris, France. He speaks sev
eral languages and is of distinguished
appearance. He came here about three
months ago with letters of recommen
dation from prominent people in New
York and was at once cordially wel
comed into society circles here and in
Oakland. He bore a letter of introduc
tion to Joaquin Miller, the â¢poet of the
Sierras." from the poet's daughter in
New York.
Kerbacker stopped at the Grand Ho
tel for a short time. Through the in
fluence of his new friends he obtained
a position in the office of the Western
Wire Works. Manager Hrubanik took
a fancy to him and invited him to stop
at his home, 1056 Union street. Ker
backer gladly accepted the invitation
and soon became a general favorite in
that locality.
Last Thursday while Kerbacker and
Hrubanik were on their wav home
from the office, Korbacker said he had
left his overcoat in the office and asked
Hrubanik to lend him his keys for a
few minutes till he went back for the
overcoat. Hrubanik reluctantly gave
him the keys and continued on his way
home.
During Hrubanik's absence from the
office on Saturday afternoon, the safe
was opened and $120 stolen. Kerbaeker
did not return to the office that after
noon and has not been seen since. It
has since been discovered that when he
borrowed Hrubanik's keys on Thurs
day, he made a wax impression of the
key to the safe and got a duplicate
key made with which he opened the
safe on Saturday afternoon. He evi
dently expected to make a much richer
haul. It is supposed that he has left
the city and the police have sent a
description of him throughout the
State.

TRAMP RIDES TO JAIL
IN A BABY CARRIAGE
PROPELLED BY POLICEMAN
Arrested for Purloining the Vehicle, the
Prisoner Declines to Walk.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
As a male adult propelling a baby
carriage is no uncommon sight after
working hours in the district south of
Market street, Frank Rice might have
escaped police attention if the vehicle
pushed by him had appeared more in
harmony with his tout ensemble. But
the glittering varnish, the satin cush
ions and the gossamer-like wicker
work were so widely at variance with
the man's general air of dinginess that
Patrolman J. J. Tillman's suspicion
was aroused by a casual glance at the
outfit as it passed him on Sherwood
place, a blind alley shooting from
Third street and between Howard and
Mission.
"That chap is 1.0 poor but proud
paterfamilias giving his last-born an
a?ring," quoth the officer to himself,
"for although paternal fondness oft is
akin to economic foolishness, I doubt
that any papa, even in the first flush
of fatherhood, would be so absolutely
asinine as to provide his idol with
such a costly conveyance and be con
tent to walk upon his uppers. More
over, the buggy is empty."
Thus it came that Mr. Rice was ac
costed with demand that he explain
his possession of the buggy. His story
was so flimsy that the policeman
laughed it to scorn and placed him
under arrest. Mr. Rice resolutely de
clined to accompany his captor, and as
the latter could not manage the pris
oner with one hand and the plunder
with the other he was forced to dump
the man into the vehicle and trundle
h?m to the nearest police station.
Mr. Rice enjoyed his ride.
The baby carriage was stolen from
151 Third street, a second-hand fur
niture store owned by A. Feig. Judge
Mogan found a prior conviction for
petty larceny against Mr. Rice and
sentenced him to thirty days' \ im
prisonment.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Edward Walsh and Harry Craig,
charged with robbery, were sent to the
Superior Court by Judge Conlan. It
â¢was shown that while they were at
tempting to steal a barrel of whisky
from the rear of James Hood's saloon,
at Twenty-fourth and Noe streets,
George Davorien tried to prevent the
robbery and was set upon by both
men and beaten. When the saloon
keeper, attracted by the noise of the
scuffle, went to the back door he re
ceived a blow on the head that stunned
him. Then the men entered the saloon
and rifled the cash register. They
were arrested by Detective Graham
and Patrolmen Cole and Harrison.
Davorien was so badly beaten that he
was taken to the City and County
Hospital for treatment.

Max Hyman, proprietor of a grog
gery within the prescribed district ad
joining the Presidio, made repeated
endeavor to get back a portion of the
$100 bail which he deposited to secure
the appearance of H. O. Bebbel, his
bartender, before Judge Mogan. Mr.
Bobbel was arrested for selling liquor
without a license, and soon after his
release on bail he disappeared. When
he failed to appear in court his bail
wa6 ordered forfeited, whereupon Mr.
Hyman's importunity began. He first
implored the Judge to return him $50,
then he offered to be content with 540,
then he dropped to $30, to $20, to $15,
and probably would have descended to
$r. If the court had not adjourned
while he was still frantically figuring.
He will have opportunity to reopen
his crusade to-morrow, however, the
Judge having considerately postponed
final judgment till then.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Antone Vosger pleaded that It waa
in jest he passed a $100 Confederate
bill In payment for drinks ordered from
and served by Frank Judnic, barten
der in the saloon of Andrew Judnic, at
461 Fourth street. After receiving
about $99 B0 In change for his spurious
currency, Mr. Vosger remained in the
saloon and freely spent money until
the proprietor arrived and discovered
that the bill was bogus, and the fact
of his staying there instead of depart
ing with his gains was urged by the
attorney tor the defense as evidence
that there waa no serious Intention to
defraud.
"Besides," argued the young legal
light, "this defendant resides in Ala
meda, where the passing of Confeder
ate currency is of common occurrence,
probably because the people over there
do not know that the civil was is over."
The case was continued till next Fri
day - . . .
For peddling lingerie without a li
cense Fon Lee was arrested in the
Western Addition, anC in lieu of ap
pearing in person to answer the
charge before Judge Mogan he sent
a note, evidently written by a Cau
casian scribe, which was as follows:
Fon Lee. the chink that was copped for
peddling underwear, lets his $10 ball go. He
say:; he has a license, but his cousin at Ja.cÂ«i
em ai.d Stockton Btreets Is using ft. If },*
\i copped again you should also cop nis cousin.
The ball was ordered forfeited.

Seventeen-year-old Emma Odd was
yearning for stage honors when she
abandoned her home, 5969 Brown
street, Oakland, last November and
came across the bay to seek an en
gagement. From applying for a po
sition as leading woman she gradually
< descended to expressing readiness to
appear as a supernumerary, but the
managers would have none of her in
any capacity, and then, too proud to
return to the parents whose counsel
she had- spurned, she became a habi
tue of the Barbary Coast dance halls.
There Patrolman Cornelius found
and arrested her for vagrancy. Judge
Mogan will probably send her to a re
formatory institution.
â¢ * â¢
Pressing his charge of vagrancy
against Joseph Sullivan, a nattily at
tired young fellow. Patrolman E. J.
Foley informed Judge Cabaniss that
the defendant was a member of "the
Booze Club," with headquarters on Noe
street, between Sixteenth and Seven
teenth, and had no visible means of
sustenance. Whereupon the defend
ant warmly retorted that the title of
the organization alluded to- is not "the
Booze Club," but the Lardue Club. To
which the officer rejoined by opining
that "the Booze Club" would be a
more appropriate appellation, inas
much as the imbibing of malt and
spirituous liquors seems to be the prin
cipal object of its being.
"Nothing of the kind," declared Mr.
Sullivan. "It's one of the most re
epectable and exclusive clubs in town.
Its membership is confined to twelve
gentlemen, and is never allowed to ex
ceed that number. It has a comfort
ably furnished home, and twice a week
it gives a social function to w^hich
ladies are admitted."
"And so is booze," muttered the offi
cer.
Then the Judge, who had been nar
rowly scanning Mr. Sullivan's ani
mated countenance, asked him if he
had not at least once before appeared
in that court as a defendant. The an
swer was affirmative.
"I thought so," said his Honor. "If
I remember the details of the offenses
with which you were previously
charged, you were arrested for mas
querading as a United States seaman
and disturbing the peace on the Barb
ary Coast."
The defendant's nod was acquiescent.
"You then pleaded," the Judge re-
sumed, "that you had appeared In na
val attire at a bal masque griven by
the Boo â beg pardon â the Lardue Club,
and that afterward you toured the Pa
cific street dance halls and there en
deavored to convey the Impression that
you were a genuine jackie."
Mr. Sullivan palpably marveled at
such accuracy of recollection.
"I then dismissed you, with a cau
tion, and now, here you are again, ac
cused of vagrrancy. What do you do
for a livelihood?"
His duties as managing director of
the Lardue Club, Mr. Sullivan stated,
occupied so much of his time as to ex
clude opportunity to do much else.
TTpon him devolved the task of keep
ing the organisation up to Its high
mark of gentility, a task which de
manded more earnest attention than
might be apparent to the casual ob
server. However, If the Court consid
ered that his stewardship did not ex
empt him from police interference un
der the provisions of the vagrancy
law, he would seek another job, even
at the cost of Imperiling the club's
future.
He waa given thirty days In which to
make good his promise.

Harold Brown was wallowing: in the
rich pasturage between the sidewalks
of Tine street, above Dupont, last
Monday afternoon when a policeman
climbed up and rolled him down to
the level and thence dispatched him
In a patrol wagon to prison. The
officer told Judge Fritz that Mr.
Brown was drunk, but Mr. Brown de*
nled the Impeachment and declared
that his exhilaration of spirit. Instead
of being of alcoholic origin, was
caused by the spring-like weather and
the sight of the luxuriant crop on the
hillside. The combined influence of
sunshine and grass, he averred, trans
ported him back to childhood's happy
hours on the old homestead, and he
could not resist the impulse to romp
as he had then romped upon the
sward. If It Is illegal to gambol
upon the lushy slopes in San Fran
cisco's business center why are not
"Keep off the grass" signs displayed?
By way of reply the Judge fined him
$5 for drunkenness and forgave the

Miserable by "Bad Temper"
When Gustave Ahlstedt, a carpen

AGED BURGLAR PROVES
TO HAVE PAST RECORD
Henry Cook Identified as Man Who
Has Served Long Term in
San Quentin.
The suspicions of the police that
Henry Cook, the aged burglar who
was arrested early Monday morning
by Policeman E. J. Plume while at
tempting to break into an apartment
house at 1038 Post street, was an old
timer at the business have been veri
fied. Detective Sergeant Bainbridge
of the identification bureau discovered
yesterday that he has been known as
LoUs Thomas, J. Halcum and J. Slo
cum.
In January, 1887, he was arrested
on three charges of burglary for en
tering the premises of W. F. Porter
& Co., 43 Sixth street. On February
12 he was sentenced to serve fifteen
years in San Quentin. He made his
escape from San Quentin on July 16,
1888, and was recaptured and re
turned on February 20, 1891. He lost
all of his credits. He was discharged
on September 19, 1904.
He will be charged with breaking
into the residence of R. W. Burtis,
813 Webster street, on Monday morn
ing and stealing a gold watch and a
nickel watch and also with attempting
to break into the apartment-hous",
1038 Post street.

BANKS SETTLE
GRAIN FIGHT
Litigants Agree to Compro
mise Claims and Divide
Leavings of Eppingers
Upon the flHns yesterday of a stipu
lation signed by the seventeen law
firms representing as many claimants
to the grain left by the Eppingers. in
the warehouse at Crockett, Judge
Murasky ordered a dismissal of the
action brought by the Nevada National
Bank to determine a distribution of
the shrunken assets. The compromise
came after the trial had shown that
further litigation would be both ex
pensive and disagreeable.
By the terms of the agreement,
twelve of the banks that hold ware
house receipts for grain as security for
leans made to the bankrupts will re
ceive stated sums. The warehouse
receipts of all will be decreed to be
promissory notes and after the stated
payments are made an addition of five
per cent will be paid on the face value
of the notes, which aggregate about
$700,000. As creditors, these claim
ants also receive dividends from the
bankruptcy proceedings, the remainder
of the $102,000 for which the grain
was sold going into the fund of the
trustee in bankruptcy.
The values of the notes of the re
spective banks, as represented by the
3500 tons of grain remaining in the
warehouses at the time of the failure,
are as follows: Bank of Monterey.
$4400; London and San Francisco
Bank, $1600; American National, *12.
000; Blum & Co., $575; International
Banking Corporation, $900; Wells
Fargo $4000; Bank of Yolo, $3000;
Haslacher & Kahn, $3000; Bank of
Woodland and Bank of Colusa, to
gether, $1500; Anglo-CalifornianÃank,
$750; Nevada National Bank, $900.
In addition to these sums. Haslacher
& Kahn are to be paid $1625 on condi
tion of agreeing not to file a claim in
the bankruptcy proceeding in which
any of the other parties are inter
ested. Heller & Powers, who repre
sented the Nevada Bank and others
with like interests, are to receive $2500
for their legal services and the costs,
$81 21, and the reporters' fees are to
be. paid out of the fund. Receiver
Henry Wads-worth has already been
awarded a fee of $3000 and his attor
neys a fee of $2000.
During the progress of the trial and
at the beginning of the conferences to
compromise there were expressions of
dissatisfaction with the methods used
by the American National to protect
its claims ahead of the others. These
reflections are dissipated by a stipu
lation signed by all the attorney in
dorsing the good faith of the bank in
question. The stipulation recites that
in the trial the American National has
proved that at the time of the failure
of the Eppingers it had a valid Hen
upon certain grain then in the ware
house at Crockett; that the grain was
in the place where it was found when
the warehouse receipts were given as
security and remained in the same
position up to the time of the failure:
that the steps taken by the American
National to protect itself at the time
of the failure and secure the property
pledged to it were proper, authority
to take possession of the grain having
been given by Eppinger & Co.
