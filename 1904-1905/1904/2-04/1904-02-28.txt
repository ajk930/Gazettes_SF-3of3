CHAPTER I.
THE DESERT.
"To every msn a damsel or two." â Judges.
The vast, gr:Â»y expanse of the desert
lay Ftill as a picture in the heat erf the
early afternoon. The silence of waste
p!aÂ«-**Â£ held it. It was gaunt and sterile,
clad with a drab growth of sase, flat as
a table, and with the white scurf of the
tkin. It was the tarth, lean, sapless.
end marked with disease. A chain of
purple hills linked down on its dead
levfl, over v.hich a wagon road passed
like a srar across a haggard face.
Prom the braztn arch of the sky heat
poured down and was thrown back
fior.i the scorched surface of the land.
It was August in the Utah Desert In
the early fifties.
In the silence Â«nd dcadness of the
Fccue there was ore point of life. The
canvas top of an emigrant wagon made
a white spot on the monotone of gray.
At noon there had been but one shad
ow in tlie desert and this was that be
neetb the wapon, which was stationary
in ihe road. Now the sun was declining
from the zenith and the shadow was
bi!a<Ic:;ins; first a mere edge, then a
tul-Etar.tial margin of shade.
In it two women were crouched
watching a child that iÂ«iy gasping.
Sc-:i:e distance away beside his two
horser, a man sat on tha ground, his
hnt over his eyes.
Ore o* the thousand tragedies the
desert had seen was being enacted.
Crushed between that dead indiffer
*n<â <* of earth and sky, its participa
tors seemed to feel the hopelessness of
movement or plaint and sat dumb, all
but the child, who was dying with that
â bleznn aloofness to surroundings of
which only those who are passing know
the secret. His loud breathing sounded
like Â£ defiance In the silence of that
savagely unsytr.pcthizing nature. The
man. the woman, the horses, were like
part of the picture in their mute Im
mobility, only the dying child dared
dcy it.
He was a pretty boy of S, and had
E'jccujr.bcd to one of the slight, juvenile
eilmcnts that during the rigors of the
overland inarch developed tragic pow
ers of death. His mother sat beside
him staring at him. She was 19 years
of age, and had been married four
years before to the man who sat in the
sh^dov.' of the horses. She looked 40.
tanned, haggard, half clad. Dazed by
hardship and the blow that had just
fclJrn. the had the air of a stupefied
animal. She said no-thing and made no
attempt to alleviate the sufferings of
her first born.
The other woman was some ten years
older, and wes a buxom, handsome
creature, large-framed, capable, stal
wartâ a woman built for struggle and
enduranceâ the mate of the pioneer.
She. too. was the wife of the man who
rr.t by the horses. He was of the Mor
mon faith, which he had joined a year
befure for the purpose of marrying her.
The sun sloned its burning course
across the pale cky. The edges of the
derert shimmered through veils of heat.
Far on the horizon the mirage of a
blue lake, with little waves creeping up
a crescent of sand, painted Itself on the
quivering air. The shadow of the wag
on stealthily advanced. Suddenly the
child moved, drew a fluttering breath
or two, and died. The two women
leaned forward, the mother helplessly:
the other, with a certain prompt decl
fcion that marked all her movements,
fe!t of the pulse and heart.
"It's all over. Lucy," she said
brusquely, but not unkindly; "I guess
you'd better get into the wagon; Jake
and I'll do everything."
The girl rose slowly like a person ac
customed 10 obey, moved to the back of
tho wagon, and climbed in.
The man, who had cecn this sudden
fJuucr of activity, pushed back his hat
and loc-ked at his wives, but did not
move or speak. The second wife cov
ered the dead child with her apron, and
approached him.
"He's dead," she said.
"We must bury him," was her next
remark.
"Well, an right," he assented.
He went to the wagon and detached
from beneath it a spade. Then he
walked a few rods away and, clearing
a space in the sage, began to dig. The
â woman prepared the child for burial.
The silence that had been disturbed re
settled, broken at Intervals by the thud
of the spade. The heat began to lessen
and a still serenity to possess the bar
ren landscape. The desert had re
ceived its tribute and was appeased.
The rites of the burial were- nearly
completed, when a sound from the
wagon attracted the attention of the
man .ind the woman. They stopped,
listened and exchanged U glance of
alarmed . intelligence. The woman
walked to the wagon rapidly, and ex
changed a few remarks with the other
wife. Her voice came to the man low
and broken. He did not hear what she
said, but he thought he knew the pur
port of her words. As he shoveled the
earth into the grave his brow was con
tracted. He looked angrily harassed.
The second, wife came toward him. her
sunburnt face set in an expression of
frowning anxiety.
VYes," she said, in answer to his
look, "she feels very bad. We got to
stop here. We can't go on now."
He made no answer, but went on
building up the mound over the grave.
He was younger by a year or two than
the woman with whom he spoke, but it
was easy- to be seen that of her, as <rf
all pertaining to him, he was absolute
master. She watched him for a mo
ment as if waiting for an order, then,
receiving none, said:
"I'd better go back to her. I wish a
train'd come by with a doctor. She
ain't got much strength."
He vouchsafed no answer, and she re
turned to the wago-n, and this time
climbed In.
He continued to build up and shape
the mound with sedulous and evidently
absent-minded care. The sweat poured
off his forehead and his bare, brown
throat and breast. He was a lean but
powerful man, worn away by the jour
ney to bone and musclÂ«, but of an iron
fiber. He had no patience with thoso
who hampered his forward march by
sickness or feebleness.
When he had finished the mound the
sun was declining toward the tops of
the distant mountains. The first color
of its setting was inflaming the sky and
painting the desert in tones of strange,
hot brilliancy. The vast, grim expanse
took on a tropical aspect. Against the
lurid background the chain of hills
turned a transparent amethyst, and the
livid earth, with its leprous eruption,
was transformed into a pale lilac blue.
Presently the thin, clear red of the sun
set was pricked by a white star point.
And in the midst of this vivid blending
of limpid primary colors, the fire the
man had k'ndled sent a fine line of
smoke straight up into the air.
The second wife came out of the
wagon to help him get the supper and
to eat hers. They talked a little in low
voices as they ate. drawn away from
the heat bf the lire. The man showed
symptoms or fatigue; but the power
erful woman was unconquered in her
stubborn, splendid vigor. When she
left him, he lay down on the san.d with
his. face on his arm and was soon
nsleep. The sounds of dole that came
from the wagon did not wake him. nor
disturb the deep dreamlessness of his
exhausted rest. The night was half
spent, when he was wakened by the
woman shaking his shoulder. He
looked up at her stupidly for a minute,
seeing her head against the deep blue
Eky with its large white stars.
"It's over. It's a little girl. But
Lucy's pret,ty bad."
He sat up, fully awake now, and in
the stillness of the night heard the. tat
like mew of the new-born. The can
vas arch of the wagon glowed with a
fiery effect from the lighted lanterns
within.
"Is the dying?" he said hurriedly.
"No â not's bad as that. But she's
terribly low. We'llhave to stay here
vith her till she pulls up some. We
can't move on with her in this way."
He rose and, going to the wagon,
looked in through the opened flap. Hl3
wife was lying with her eyes closed,
waxen pale in the smoky lantern light
The sight of her shocked him into a
sudden spasm of feeling. She had been
a fresh and pretty girl bf 15 when he
had married her, four years before at St.
Louis. He wondered If her father, who
had given her to Jiim then, would have
known her now. In an excess ofcare
less pity he laid his hand on her and
raid:
"Well. Lucy, how d'ye feel?"
She shrank from his touch and tried
to draw a corner of the blanket, on
which her head rested, over her face.
He turned away and walked back to
the fire, saying to the second wife:
"I guess she'll be able to go on to
morrow. She can stay In the wagon all
the. time. I don't want to run no risks
*er gittin' caught in the snows on the
Sierra. I guess she'll pull herself to
gether all right in a few days. I've
seen her worse *ri that."
j CHAPTER II.
STRIKING A t BARGAIN.
How the world is made for each of us! '
How aU we perceive and know in It '
;â â  Tends to some moments' . product thus.
When a eoul declares itsellâ to wit: â¢ '-
By its fruit, the thing it does*
â BnCWNING.
Where the foothills fold back, upon
one another in cool, blue shadows, and
the tops of the Sierra, brushed with
bdow, look down on a rugged rampart
of mountains falling away to a smiling
plain, Dan Moreau and his partner had
been working a stream-bed since June.
Placervllleâ still Hangtownâ though al
ready past the feverish days of its first
youth, was some twenty- five miles to
the southwest. A few miles to the
south the emigrant .trail 'from Carson
crawled over the shdulder.of the Sierra.
Small trails broke from the parent one
and trickled down from the summit, by
"the line of least resistance." to the
outposts of civilization that were
planted here and there on the foothill
and valley.
The canyon where Moreau and his
"pard" were at work was California,
virgin and unconquered. The forty
niners had passed it by in their eager
rush for fortune. Yet the narrow
gulch, that steamed at midday with
heated airs and was steeped in the pun
gent fragrance which California ex-
â 
\ THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CAUL
hales beneath the, arbors of the sun,
was yielding the two miners a good
supply of, gold". Their pits had honey
combed the stream's banks far- up and
down. Now, In September, the water
had dwindled to a silver thread, and
they had dammed it near the rocker in
to a miniature lake, into which Fletch
erâ Moreau's partnerâ plunged his dip
per with untiring regularity, at' the
same" time moving the rocker which
filled the hot silence the canyon with
its lazy monotonous rattle.
They had been working with little
cessation since early June. The rich
ness of their claim and the prospect
that the first snows would put an end. to
labors and profits had spurred them to
unremitting exertion. In a box under
Moreau's bunk there' were six small
buckskin sfecks of dust, joint profits of
the summer's toll.
Moreau, a muscular, fair-haired giant
of a man, was that familiar figure of
the early days â the gentleman miner.
He was a New Englander of birth and
education, who had come to California
in the first rueh, with a little fortune
wherewith to make a great one. Luck
had not been with him. This was h's
first taste of success.* Five months be
fore he had picked up a "pard" in Sac
ramento, and after the careless fashion
of the time, when no one sought. to in
quire too closely into another's ante
cedents, joined forces w|th him and
spent a wandering spring, prospecting
from bar to bar and camp to camp.
The casual words of an 'Indian had di
rected them to the canyon', where now
the creak of their rocker filled the hot,
drowsy days.
, Of Harney Fletcher, Moreau knew
nothing. He had met him In a lodging-:
house in Sacramento* and the partner
ship proved to be a Successful one.
What the New Englander furnished in
money, the other made up in practical
experience and general handlness. It
was Fletcher who had constructed the
rocker on an improved model of his
own; His had been the" directing brain
as well as the assisting hand which had
built the cabin of logs that surveyed
the stream-bed from a knoll above.
The last remnants of Mqreau's fortune
had stocked it well, and there were two
good horses in the brush shed behind it.
It was now September, and the leaves
of the aspens that, grew alongv the
stream bed were yellowing.; , But the air
was warm and golden with sunshine.
Above, in the high places of the Sierra,
where the emigrant trail crept' along
the edges of ravines and crawled up the
mighty flank of the wall that shuts the
garden of California from the "desert
beyond, the snow Tvas already deep.
Fletcher,' wht>. had gone into Hangtown
the wee^c before fot. provisions, had
come ba<Jk full of stories .of the swarms
of emigrants: pouring down the main
road and its branching trails, higgledy
piggledy, pejl-mell. hungry, gaunt, half
clad, in their wlld'rush to enter, the'land
of promise. - : ; . 'V i
Theie was ruÂ» suggestion of winter
here. The hot air was steeped in the
ardmatic scents that the sun draws
from the mighty pines which clothe the
foothills. At midday the little gulley
where the men worked was he^vy with
them. All about them was strangely
silent. The pines rising rank on rank
stirred to no paEsing breezes. There
was no bird n6te, and the stream had
shrunk so that its CDrlng-time song
had become a whisper.- Heat and si
lence held the long days, when the red
dust lay motionless on the trail above,
and the noise made by the rocker
sounded strangely Intrusive v ahd loud
in the enchanted stUlncES that held the
landscape. /; -\
On an afternoon like this the men
were working in the:stream bedâMo
reau in the pit, Fletcher "at his place by
the rocker. There was rid conversation
between them. The picture-like dumb
ness of their surroundings seemed to
have communicated Itself to them. Far
above, glittering against the bule, the
white peaks of the Sierra looked down
on them Â«from remote, aerial heights.
The tiny thread of water gleamed in its
wide, unoccupied bed. Save the men.
the only moving thing' In sight was a
hawk that hung, poised in the sky
above, its winged shadow floating for
ward and pausing on the slopes of tha
gulch.
Into this spellbound silence a sound
suddenly brokeâ a sound unexpected
and unwished forâ that of a human
voice. It was a man's, harsh and loud,
evidently addressing cattle. With it
came the creak of wheels. The two
partners listened, amazed and irreso
lute. The trail that passed their cabin
was an almost unknown" offshoot from
the main highway. Then, the sounds
growing clearer, they scrambled up the
banlc Coming Sown the road they saw
the curved top of a prairie shcooner
that formed a background for^the
forms of two skeleton horses, 'beside
which walked a: man who urged, them
on with shouts and blows.? Wagon and
horses were enveloped In a cloud of red
dust. -"' ;,'
At the moment. that the miners saw
this unwelcome* sight, one of the
wretched beasts stumbled, and pitching
forward, fell with what sounded like a
human groan. The man, with an oath',
went to it and gave it a kick-. But it
jy&s too far spent to rally, and settling
.on. its side, lay gasping. ' A" woman;
stout and sunburned, ran round from
the back bf the cart,' with a face of an
gry consternation. As Moreau ap
proached, he heard her. say to the man
who, with oaths and blows, was at
tempting to drag the horse to it3 feet:
"Oh. it ain't no use doing that. Don't
you see it's dying?",
Moreau saw that she was right. The
anim&l was in its death throes. As he
came up he said, without preliminaries:
"Take off* its harness, the poor brute's
done for," and began to unbuckle the
rags of harness which held it to the
wagon.
The man and woman turned, startled,
and saw him. Looking back they, saw
Fletcher, who was coming slowly, and
evidently not very willingly,, forward.
The sight of the. exhausted pioneers
was a too familiar one to interest him.
The dying horse claimed a lazy cast of
his Indifferent eye. Moreau and the
man loosed the harness, lifted the pole,
and let the creature lie free from ln
cumbrance. The other horse, freed, too,
stood drooping, too spent to move from
where "If 1 had. stopped. If "other, testi
mony were needed of the terrible jour
ney they were ending, one saw it in the
gaunt face of the man, scorched by. the
sun, seamed with lines, with a fringe of
ragged beard, and long locks of un
kempt hair hanging from beneath his
' miserable hat. 'i
This stoppage of his Jouxgey with the
promised land in sight seemed to'ex
asperate him to a point where he evi
dently feared to speak. With eyes full
of savage despair he stood looking at
the horse. Both he and the woman
seemed so overpowered by the calamity
that they had no attention to give to
the two, strangers, stood side by
side, staring morosely at the animal.
.."What'll we do?" she said hopeless
ly. "Spotty,' 1 '.indicating the other
horse, "ain't no. use alone." 'j
Moreau, spoke up encouragingly!
"Why don'fyou leave the wagon and
the other horse here? You can; walk into
Hangtown by easy stages.' The Porter
ranch , is only twelve miles - from ; here
and you can stay there all night. ' The
poor beast can't do . much more,; and
we'll feed it .'.and. take, -care of your
other things! while;" you're gone.".:
- "Oh/damn it, we can't! "said the man"
furlousljCVJ"'"' .*' ' '
As'1f. in 'explanation of this remark,
a woman*- .suddenly : appeared at the
open front of the wagon. -She, had evi
dently*"** been ,â¢ lying within it, arid* had
not risen until now."
. When Moreau looked at her he ex
perienced a violent thrill of pity, 'that
the' evident sufferings of the others had
not evoked. He was a man of a deeply
tender and sympathetic nature toward
all that was helpless and weak. As. his
glance met the face of this Woman, he
thought she was the most piteous ob
ject, he had ever seen. .â¢*"'
"You'd better come into the" cabin,"
he said, "aqd see what you can do. You
can't go on^'now, and you look pretty
well used up." '"'â  v
The man gave a grunt of assent, and
taking the other horse by the head be
gan to lead it toward the cabin, being
noticeably careful to steer it out of the
way of all stumbling blocks. The wo
mail in the sunbonnet called to hei
companion in the wagon:
: "Come, Lucy, get a move on! We're
going to stop and rest."
Thus addressed, the wuman moved to
the back of the cart, drevv the flap aside
and "slipped out. She came behind the
others, and. Moreau, looking back, saw
that she walked slowly, as if feeble, or
in pain. â  .
Advancing to the sunbor.neted figure
in front of him he. said, with a back
ward "jerk of his* head: "What's the
matter with her? Is she sick?"
The woman save an indifferent
glance j.b&ckwnrd. Like the man, she
seemed completely preoccupied by
their disaster.
"Not now," she answered, "but she
has been. But good Lord!"â with a
sudden burst of angry bitternessâ "wo
men like her ain't meant to take th$m
sort of Journeys. If it weren't for her,
Jake and I could go on all right."
She relapsed into silence as the cabin
revealed itself through the trees. It
appeared to interest her, and she went
to the door and looked in.
It . was the typical miner's cabin of
'tile parfcttV" oonirtsUng o* a. Kinjls roorm
with two bunks. Opposite the doorway
waa the wide-mouthed chimney, a slab
of rock before It doing duty as hearth
â tdrieA'There was an armchair formed
-of a barrel,- cushioned with' red flannel
and mounted oa rockers, j Morea.u'8
bunk was covered with a miner's blan
ket, and the ineradicable habits of the
grentleinan spoke In the very simple but
sufficient tc-ilet accessaries that stood
on a shelf under a tiny square of loolc
t Â£ng 7 slaiss. . Over the roof 'a. great pine
spread its boughs, and â¢ In _ passing
through these the slightest breith of air
made soft eolian murrouriogs. To the
pioneers, the wild, rough place looked
the ideal of comfort and luxury. "
A small spring bubbled up near the
roots of the pine and trickled across the
space In front of the cabin. To this, by
common consent, the party made its
tray. The exhausted horse plunged its
nose in the cool current and drank and
snorted and drank again. The elder
woman knelt down- and laved her face
and neck and even the top of her head
In the water. The man stood looking
with a mecdy eye at his" broken animal,
and Joined by Fletcher, they talked
over its condition. The miner.; versed
In this as In all practical matters,
deemed the beasc incapacitated for
journeys of any Ierurth for some time
to come. Both animals had been driv
en to the limit of their strength.'
The pioneer assented:
"I had to get acrost before the snows
blejketrus. and they're heavy up there
now," with a nod of his head toward
the mountains above; "then I wanted
to set down., Into the settlements us
soon's I could. 1 knew there weren't
two more days work in "em, but I cal
k'lated they'd get me in. Xfter that it
didn't matter."
"The only thing for you to do is to
walk into Hangtown, buy a mule there,
arid come back."
The man made a despairing gesture.
"How the hell can I. with her?" he
said, indicating the younger woman.
Fletcher turned round and surveyed
her with a cold, exploring eye where
she had sunk down on the roots of the
pine.' with* her bade ajc'alnst Its tmak.
"She locks pretty well tucktred otn.
he said. "Tcur wife?" â¢ , .
"Yea."
"And the othsr one's your sister?' he
continued with glib curiosity.
"She's my wife, too." j
The inquirer, who was used to such
plurality on the part of the Utah emi
grants, gave a whistle and said:
"Mormons, eh?"
The man nodded.
Maantlme Moreau had entered the
cabin to get some food and drink to
offer the sick woman. In a few mo
ments he reappeared carrying a tin cup
containing whisky diluted with water
from the spring, and approached the
woman sitting by the tree trunk. Her
eyes were closed and she presented a
deathlike appearance. The shawl she
had worn round her shaulders had fall
en back and disclosed a jmall bundle
that she held with a loose carelessness.
The man. noticed the way her arms
were disposed about it. and wc-ndered.
Coming to a standstill before her. he
said:
"I've brought you something that 11
brace you up. Would you like to try
it?".
She raised her lids and looked at him.
and then at the cup. As he met her
glance he noticed that her eyes were a
clear Drown like a Cog's, and for the
first time he realized that she might t>Â»
yc-ung. She stretched out her hand
obediently and taking the cup drank a
little, then silently gave it back.
"You'vr hat! a pretty roujh time I
guess." he sj'.d. holding the cup which
he liUer.;!ed to give her again in a min
ute.
She nodded. Thsn suddenly the tear*
brgan to v.-c'.l out of her eyes, quantities
of tears that ran in a flocd over her
cheeks. She did not sob or attempt to
hide her face. but. leaning h?r head
anainst the tree, let the tears flow as
thc-ugh lest to everything but her sense
of misery.
"Oh. poor thing! poor thing!" he ex
claimed In a burst of sympathy.
"You're half dead. Here take some
more of this." and he pressed the cup
into her hand, not knowir.s what else
to <3o fcr her.
She took it. and then, through th*
taars. he sav.* her cast a look of furtive
alarm toward her husband. She was
v/ithin his lire of vision and tried to
shift herself behind Mcreau. ? ~*" s
With a sensation of angry dissust ha
understood that she feared this un
kempt and haggard creature to whom
she belonged. He moved so that he
sheltered her and watched her fry to
drink again. But her tears blinded her
and she handad the cup back with a
shaking hand.
"It's been too much." she gasped. "If
I could only have-died: My boy did.
Out there on them av.ful plains when
there ain't a tree and it's hot like a
furnace. And they buried him there â
Bessie and he."
'Bessie and he?" he repeated vague
ly, his p!ty entirely preoccupying his
mind for the moment.
"Yes, EeSsie â the second wife. I'm
the first." > â¢-
"Oh." he said, comprehending, "you're

"Not me," she answered quickly, "I'm

Ihc emigrant. Bessie and Fletcher,

themselves to a bcre spot on the shaded

ship's biscuits and drinking whisky and
water from a tin' cup. that circulated
from hand to hand. As Moreau ap
proached he couid hear his partner
volubly expatiating c.n the barrenness
of the stream beds in the vicinity. The
stranger was listening to him with a
cogitating eye. his seamed, weather
worn face set in an expression of
frowning attention. Her hunger ap
peased, Bessie ha.d curled up on her side
and wivh her sunbonnet still on had
fallen into a deep, healthy sleep.
Moreau joined them, and listened
with mingled surprise and amusement
to Fletcher's glib lies. Then, when his
partner's fluency was exhausted, he
questioned the emigrant on his trip.
The man's answers were short and non
committal. He seemed in a morose,
savage state at his ill luck, his mind
still engrossed by the question of mov
ing on.
"If I'd money," he said. "I'd give you
anything you'd ask for them two horses
'er your'n in the shed. But I ain't a
thing to give â not a red."
"Your wife, your other wife," said
Moreau, "doen't seem to me fit to go on.
She's dead beat."
The man gave an angry snort.
"She's been like that pretty near the
whole way," he said. "Everything's
been put back because of her."
He relapsed into moody silence and
then said suddenly: "We're goin* if
she's pot to walk."
Moreau went back to the cabin. They
had half killed ths wc-man already; now
if they insisted on her walking the
wretched creature might' collapse al
together. Would they leave her on the
mountain roads, he wondered?
He reached the cabin door, knocked
ar.d heard her answering "come in."
She was sitting on an upturned box
beside the bunk on which the baby
slept. Her sunbunnet was off. and he
noticed that she had bright hair, rip
l>k-d and thick, and of the same red
dish-bruwn color as her eyes. She had
washed away the traces of her tears,
but her clothes, hardly sufficient cover-
Ing for her lean, worn body, were dirty
and ragged. No beggar he had ever
seen in the distant New England town
where he had spent his boyhood had
presented a more miserable appearance.
She looked timidly at him and rose
frÂ»-m the box, pushing it toward him.
"1 put the baby on the bunk," she
said, apologetically, "but I can hold
"Oh. don't disturb her." he said
quickly. "It's the only place you could
have put her." Then, seeing her stand
ing, he said, "Why don't you sit
down?"
She sat charily and evidently ill at
ease.
"They've been eating out there," he
said, "and I thought you might like
something, too. There's some stuff
ever there in the corner if you'll wait a
moment."
He went to the corner where the sup
piies were stored and rifled them for
more ship's biscuit and a wedge of
cheese, u. delicacy which Fletcher had
brought from Hangtown on his last
visit, end which he carefully refrained
from' off eringr to the hungry emigrants.
Coming back with these he drew out
another box and spread them cm it be
fore her. She looked on in heavy, si
lent surprise. When he had finished he
said:
"Now- fe.Il to. You want food as
much as anything."
She made no effort to eat, and he
said, disappointed: "Don't you want it?
Oh. make a try."
She "made a try," and bit off a piece
<>r cracker, while he again retired to the
supply corner for the tin cup and the
whisky. He tried to step softly so as"
not to wake the child, and there was
something ludicrous in the sight of this
vast, bearded man. with his mighty.
half-barfcd arms and muscular throat,
trying to be noir.eless, with as much
success as one might expect of a bear.
Suddenly, in the midst of her repast,
tho woman broke dtrwn completely;
.-â nd. uitli bowed head, rhe was shaken
by a tempest of r.ome violent emotion.
It was not like her tears of an hour be
foi*. v.hich seemed merely an indication
of physical txhaustion. This was an
expression of spiritual tumult. Sobs
rent her and she rocked back and forth
struggling with some fierce paroxysm.
Moreau. cup In hand, gazed at her in
'Jistrzcted helplessness.

"Oh, I can't go on," she groaned. "I
c.in't. How can I. Oh, it's too much!
I can't go on."
He v.Â»Â«s silent before tills 111 for which
he had no remedy, and she wailed
again in the as ny of her spirit:
â¢I cant. I cant. If I could c-nly die!
But now there's the baby, and I can't
even die."
He got up feeling sick at heart at
sight of this hopeless despair. What
could he suggest to the unfortunate
ci mature? He felt that anything he
could say would be an insult in Â£he face
of such a position. "
"Oh. God. why can't we die? she
croanedâ "why can't we die?"
Ab she said the words the sound of
approaching voices came through the
oSen door. Her husband's struck
through her agony and froze it. She
stiffened and lifted her face full of an
animal look of listening. Moreau no
ticed her blunt and knotted hands, piti
ful in their record of toil, as she held
them up in the transfixed attitude of
strained* attention.
"What now?" she said to herself.
The pioneer, Fletcher and Bessie
came slowly round the corner of the
cabin. Bessie looked sleepily anxious,
Fletcher lazily amused. As Moreau
stepped out ,?f the doorway toward
them he realized that they had come to
some decision.
"Well," said the man, "we got to
"You're going on?" said Moreau.
"How about the wagon?"
"We're goin' to leave the wagon, and
I'll come back for it from Hangtown.
It's the only thing to do."
And the norss.
"He calk'Iatcs," said Fletcher, "to
mount his wifeâ the pecked one â on the
hcrse and take her along till one or
other of 'em drops."
"Take your wife on that horse?" ex
claimed Moreau. "Why. it can't go
two miles."
"Well, maybe it can't." returned the
man with an immovable face.
There was a pause. Moreau was con
scious that the woman was standing
behind him in the doorway. He could
hear her breathing.
"Come on, Lucy," said the husband.
"We got to move on some time."
Here the second wife spoke up:
"I don't see how the horse is goin' to
get Lucy twelve miles, and this man
says the first place we can stop is
twelve miles farther along."
"Don't you begin with your everlast
ing objections," said the husband, furi
ously. "Get the horse."
The woman evidently knew the time
had passed for trilling and turned away
toward the brush shed. Fletcher i fol
lowed her with a grin. The situation
appealed to his sense of humor, and he
was curious as to the outcome.
Moreau and the emigrant were left
facing each other, with the first wife
in the doorway. â  ,
"Your wife's not able to go on," said
the miner â his manner becoming sud
denly authoritative; "no more than
the horse is."
"Maybe not," said the other, "but
they're both goin' to try."
"But can't you see the horse can't
carry her? She certainly can't walk in
to tfiangtown, or even to Porter's
ranch." â¢
"No. I can't see. And how's it come
to be your business â what they can do
or whal they can't?"
"It's any one's business to prevent a
woman from being half killed."
' "Since you seem to think so much
about her, why don't you keep her here
yourself?"
The man speke with a savage sneer,
his eyes full of steely defiance.
Before he had realized the full im
port of his words, burning with rage
against the brutal tyrant to whom the
wife was of no more moment than the
horse, Moreau answered:
"I willâ let her stay!"
There was a moment's pause. The
emigrant's face, dark with rage, was
suddenly lighted by a curiously alert
expression of intelligence. He looked
at the wc-man in the background and
then at the miner.
"I'm not giving anything away just
now," he answered. "When she's well
she's of use. But I'll swap her for your
two horses." t
In the heat of his indignation and
disgust Moreau turned and looked at
the woman. She was leaning against
the door frame, chalk white, and star
ing at him. She made no sound, but
her dog-like eyes seemed to speak fc-r
his mercy more eloquently than her
tongue ever could.
"All right." he said quietly. "It's a
bargain."
"Done," said the emigrant. "You'll
find her a good worker when she pulls
herself together. You stay on here.
Lucy. Bessie," he sang out, "bring
around them horses."
Under the phlegm of his manner
there was a sudden expanding heat of
shame that he strc-ve to hide. The wo
man neither stirred nor spoke, and Mo
reau etood with his back to her, strug
gling with his passion against the man
who had been her owner. The impulse
under which he had spoken had full
possession of him, and his main feeling
was his desire to rid himself of the em
igrant and his other wife.
"Here," he said, "go on and tell them
that you'll take the horses. Hurry. up!"
The -man needed no second bidding
and made off rapidly round the corner
of the cabin.
Moreau and the woman were silent.
For the moment he had forgotten her
presence, engrossed by the rage that
filled bis warmly generous nature. In
stinctively he followed the man to the
angle of the cabin whence he could
command the brush shed. The trio
were standing there. Fletcher and the
woman listening amazed to the emi
grant's explanation. Moreau turned
back to the cabin and his eye fell on
the woman in the doorway.
"Well," he said â trying to speak
easilyâ "don't mind staying on here for
a while, do you? I guess we can make
you cc-mfortable."
She made no answer, and after wait
ing a moment he said:
"When you get stronger I'll be able
to i d you something to do in Hang
town. You know you couldn't go on,
feeling so bad. And this air round
here"â with a wave c-f his hand to the
surrounding pinesâ "will brace you up
finely."
She gave a murmured sound of as
sent, but more than this made no re
ply. tDnly her dog-like eyes again
seemed to speak. Their miserable look
of gratitude made Moreau uncomforta
ble and he could think of nothing to
say.
The sc-und of the trio advancing from
the shed came as a .welcome interrup
tion. They appeared round the corner
of the cabin, leading, the miner's two
powerful and well-fed horses. Evi
dently the situation had been ex
plained. Fletcher's face was enigmati
cal. The ".umorousness of the novel
exchange had come a little too close to
his own comfort to be quite as full of
zest as it had been earlier in the after
noon. He had insisted that the emi
grant leave his horse, which the man -
had no objection to doing. Bessie
looked flushed and excited. Moreau
thought he detected shame and disap
proval under her agitated demeanor.
But to her work was a matter of sec
ond nature. She put the horses to the
tongue of the wagon and buckled the
rags of harness together before she
turned for a last word to her. compan
ion. This was characteristically brief:
"So long, Lucy," she said, "let's see
the baby again." " .
It was shown her and she kissed it
on the forehead with some* tenderness.
Then she. climbed on the wheel, of the
wa'gon . and . took , from the, interior a #
bundle tied up in printed calico., and*
laid it on the ground. It contained all
the personal belongings and wardrobe
of the first wife. There were a\ few
murmured sentences between them and
then she turned to ascend to her seat.
But before she had fairly mounted a
sudden Impulse seized her and whirled
her back to give Lucy a gbod-by kiss.
There was more feeling in this action
than in anything that had passed be
tween the trio during the afternoon.
The two wives had been women who
had mutually suffered. There wÂ«re.
tears in Bessie's eyes as she climbed to
her place. The husband never turned
his head in the direction of his first
wife. But as he took the reins and pre
pared to start the team, he called:
"Good-by, Lucy."
He clucked at the horses, and the
wagon m'c-ved forward amid a stir of
red dust. The woman on the front seat
drew her sunbonnet over her face. The
man beside h?r looked neither to the
right nor the left, but stared out over
his newly acquired team -with an im
passively set visage. His *long whip
curled out with a hiss, the spirited an-
imals gave a forward bound, and the
wagon' went clattering and' jolting
down the trail.
Moreau stood watching its canvas
arch go swinging downward under the
dark boughs of the pines and the flick
ering foliage of the aspens. He
watched until abend in the road hid it.
Then he turned toward the cabin.
Fletcher was standing behind him,
surveying him with a cold and sar
donic eye: , .
"Well, you've done it!"
"I guess , I have."
"What! the devil are you going to do
"Don't know."
v And the horses gone; nothin* but
that busted cayuse left!"
They, stood looking at each other,
Fletcher angrily incredulous, Moreau
smilingly, deprecating and apologetic. ]
As they stood thus, neither, knowing
what to say, .the. emigrant's wife ap
peared at the doorway of the cabin.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY â¢ CALL.
"I'll get your supper now if it's the
right time," she said timidly.
CHAPTER III.
HE RIDES AWAY. - -
Alas, my Lord, my life Is not a thine
â¢Worthy your noble thoughts! "Tit not a life,
'Tls but a piece of childhood thrown away." .'
BEAUMONT and FLETCHER.
That night the-' two miners, rolled
themselves in their blankets and lay
down on ! the expanse' of slippery grass
under the pine. Moreau ' did not â¢' sleep
soon. The day's incidents â  were the
first' interruption to the monotony of
their uneventful summer. â  '
Now, - the strong man, lying on his
back, looking at the large* white stars
between the pine boughs, thought . of
what he had done 'with perplexity, but
without regret. In the still peaceful
ness of the night he turned" over in' his
mind what he should do when the. wo
man grew stronger. Women were rare
in the mining districts, and he knew
that the'emigrant wife could earn high
wages as ' alservant "either in f Hang
town or the growingmetropplis of Sac
ramento. The child might hamper her,
but he could help her to take care of
the' child until she got ' fairly on her
feet. He had nothing much to do with
his "dust." ' Strong : and young and in
California, that always meant money
enough.
So be thought, pushing uneasiness
from his mind. Turning on his hard
bed he could see the dark bulk of the
cabin with a glint of starlight on its
window. Above, the black boughs of
the' pine made a' network against the
sky sown with stars of an extraordi
nary size and , luster.' He could hear
the river eleepily murmuring to itself.
Once, far off, in the higher mountains,
the shrill, weird cry of a California
lion tore the silence. He rose on his
elbow, looking toward the cabin. The
sound was a terrifying cne, and he was
prepared to see the woman come out.
frightened, and had the words of reas
surance ready to call to her. But there
was no movenent froni the little hut.
She was evidently wrapped in the sleep
of utter fatigue.
In the morning he was down at a
basin sccoped in- the stream bed mak
ing a hasty toilet, when Fletcher,
sleepy-eyed and yawning, came slip
ping over the bank.
"What are we goin' to do for break
fast?" he said. .' "Is that purchase o*
yourn goin' to git it? She'd oughter do
something to show she's worth the two
best horses this side er Hangtown."
Moreau.. with his hair and beard be
dewed with his ducking, was about to
answer when. a sound from above at
tracted them. ->;..
Lucy was standing on the bank. In
the clear morning light she looked
white and pinched. Her wretched
clothes of yesterday, a calico sack and
skirt, were augmented by a clean apron
of blue check. Her 6kirt was short and
showed her feet in a pair of rusty shoes
that were so large they might have
been her husband's. *v 'Â»/â 'â 
"Are *yc-u comln' to breakfast?" she
said; "it's ready." Then she disap
peared. The men looked at each other
'and Moreau shook the drops from his
beard and began to try to pat his. hair
into order. The civilizing Influence of
woman â even such an unlovely wojnnan
as the emigrant's wifeâ was beginning
its work. . '
Lucy had evidently been busy. ThÂ«
litter that had disfigured the ground
in front cf the cabin was cleared away.
Through the open door and window a
current of resinous mountain air
passed which counteracted the effect of
the fire. Nevertheless she had eyiCont
ly feared its heat would be oppressive,
and had brought two of the boxes to
the ' rude bench', outside . the doorway.
and on these the breakfast was laid.
It was of the simplestâ fried bacon,
coffee and hot biscuits â but the scent
of these, hot and appetizing, was sweet
In the nostrils of the hungry men.
Sitting on the bench, they fell to nnd
were not disappointed. The emigrant's
wife had evidently great skill In ths
preparation of the simple food of the
pioneer. With the scanty means at
her hand she had concocted a meal that
to the men. used to their own primitiva
cooking, seemed the most foothsome
they had eaten since they left San
Francisco.
As she retired into the cabin, Fletch
er â his mouth full of biscuit â said:
"Well, she can cook anyway. I won
der how she gets her biscuits so- all
fired light? They ain't all saleratus,
neither."
Here she reappeared, carrying ths
coffee-pot, and. leaning over Fletcher's
shoulder, prepared to refill his tin cup.
"Put it down on the table. He can do
it himself," commanded Moreau sud
denly.
She set It down Instantly, with her
invariable frightened obedience.
"We're not used to being waited on."
he continued. "Now you sit denvn
here,"â he rose from his end of the
bench and pointed to itâ "and next
thing we want I'll go in and get it.
You've had your breakfast, of course?"
"No â I ain't had mine yet," she an
swered meekly.
"Well, why ain't you?" h? almost
shouted. "What d'ye mean by giving
us ours first?"
She loc-kod terrified and shrank a
little on tbe bench. Moreau had a
dreadful idea that for a 'moment shÂ«
was afraid of being struck.
"Here, take this "cup," he said, giv
ing her his â "and this bacon," picking
from the pan, which stood In the mid
dle of the table, the choicest pieces, and
a biscuit. "There â now eat. I'm done."
She tried to eat. but it was evidently
difficult. Her hands, bent and disfig
ured with work, shook. At Intervals
she cast a furtive, questioning look at
him where he sat on an overturned box,
eying her with good-humored interest.
As he met the frightened dogr-eyes ha
smiled encouragingly, but she was
grave and returned to her ' breakfast
with nervous haste.
As the men descended the bank to thÂ«
stream bed, Fletcher said:
"Well, she's some use in the world.
That's the first decent meal we've had
since we left Sacramento."
"She didn't eat much of it herself,"
returned his oard as he began the
morning's work.
"She Is the gol-darnedest lookln' wo
man I ever seen. Looks as If she'd been
fed on shavings. I'll lay ten to one that
emigrant cuss she b'lonss to has 'most
beat the life out er her."
Ascending to the cabin an hour later,
Moreau came upon the woman, wash
ing the breakfast dishes In the stream
that trickled from the spring. She did
not hear him approach, and, watching
her, he sav/ that she was slow and fee
ble in her ir.c-vements. The sun spat
tered down through the pine boughs on
her thick, brilliant-colored hair, and on
the nape of her neck, where the skin
was tanned to a coarse, russet brown.
"What are you doing that for?" ha
said, coming to a standstill In front of
her. "You needn't bother about thÂ»
pans."
"They'd oughter be cleaned," she an-
Bwered.
"You don't want to feel." he said,
"that you've got to work all the tlm*.
I wanted you to rest up a bit. It's a
good place to rest here."
She made no answer, drying the tin
cups on a piece Â«>f flour sack.
"I ain't so awful tired," she said
presently in a low voice.
"Well, don't you worry about having
everything so clean; they'll do anyway.
And the cabin's pretty cleanâ isn't it?"
he asked, somewhat anxiously.
"Ytsâ awful clean," she said. Then,
"after a moment, she continued: "I
hadn't oughter have stayed in the cab-
In. It's your'n. Me and the baby'll ba
all right in the brush shed with Spot
ty."
"What nonsense!" retorted Moreau.
"Do you suppose I'd let you and that
baby stay in the brush shed, the place
where the horses have been kept all
summer? You're goinr; to keep the cab
in, and if there's anything you want
might need for the babyâ why. Fletch
er'll go to Hangtov.n and get it. J4!3t
say what' you want. Not having wo
men around, we're probably short of all
sorts of little fixin~r."
"I don't want nothing." she said with
her head down â "I ain't never been so
comfortable sence I was married."
"Have you been married long?" ha
asked, less from curiosity than from
the desire to make her talk.
"Four years," she replied; "I was
married in St! Loui?, just before dad
and I was startin' to cross the plains.
Dad was taken sick. 3-Ie was con
sumpted, and some one tol* him to go
to California, so we was goin' to start
along with a heap of other folk3. We
was all waitin* 'round St. Loui3 for the
weather to settle and that's how I met
Jake."
"Jake?" said Moreau. interrogatively;
"who was Jake?'*
"My husband â Jake Shackleton. He
wa3 one o' the drivers of the train. He
drove McGinnes' teams." He was there
in camp with us, and up and asked me,
and dad was glad to get any one to
take care of me, bein' as he was so con
sumpted. We was married a week
afore the train started. I didn't favor
it much, but dad thought it was a good
thing. My father was a Methodist
preacher, and knowin' as how he
couldn't last long, he was powerful
glad to get some one to look after me.
I was pretty young to be left â just 15."
"Fifteen!" echoed Moreau â then piec
ing together her scant bits of biogra
phyâ"Then you're cnly 19 now?"
"That's my age," she said with her
laconic dryness.
He looked at her in Incredulous
amaze. Nineteen! A girl, almost a
child! A gush of pity and horror welled
up in h'm, and for the moment he
could find no words. She went on, evi
dently desirous of tellins him of her
self as in duty bound to her new
master,
"Dad died before we got to Salt Lake.
Then Jake and I settled there and
Willie was born, and for two years it
wern't so bad. Jakj liked me and was
good to me. But he got to know the
Mormons and kep' sayi..' all the time
it weren't no good do-in' anything not
bein* a Mormon. He said they had no
use for him. bein" a Gentile. And then
he seen Bessie â she was a waitress in
the Sunset Hotelâ and go$ powerful set
on her. She was a big. strong woman,
and could work. Not like me. I
couldn't never work except in the
house. ' I was no good for outdoor
work. I was always a sort er drag, he
said. So he turned Mormon and mar
ried Bessie, and she came to live with
34
tis." She stopped and began rubbing a
pan with a piece of flour sack.
"Don't tell any more if you don't
want to," said the man, hearing his
voice slightly husky.
'Oh, I don't mind." she answered
with her colorless, unemotional intona
tion; "I couldn't ever come to feel she
was his vife. too. I hadn't them no
tions. My father was a preacher. I
iuUed it all, but I could't seem
to think of anything else to
do. I had to stay. There
was no one t<> go to. Dad was

tho way my little boy died. That was
all I had. and I didn't care then what^
happened. And only for the other baby 1
I'd ct crep" but er the wagon some night
and run away and pot last on the*)
plains. Hutâ"
She stopped and made a gesture of
extending her h;:nd^ outvurd and then
letting them f: - .!l at her sides. It was
tragic in its complete hopelessness. Of
platitude to Moresu she seemed to
have little. She had been so beaten
down by misfortune that nothing was
left in her but acquiescence. Her very
service to him seemed an Instinctive
thing, the result of rigorous training.
" ".Vel^." ho said after a pause, "you've
ha.i a hard time. Rut it's over now.
Don't you think about it any more.
You're P<in:-: to res', up here, and when
you're strong and well again we'll think
about something for you to do. Time
enough for that then. But you can al
ways get work tad high pay in Hang
tuu;i or .Sacramento. Or if yc-u don't
fancy it at any of those places I'll see
to it that you po down to San Fran
cisco. Don't bother any more anyhow.
You'i! about got to the bo-ttom of things
and now you're coming up."
She gathered up her pans and said
dully: "Thark you, fir."
The cry of the baby struck on her
ear Mnd she scrambled to her feet, and
without more words turned and walked
to lhe <abin.
At dinner the again made her appear
ance on the bank and called the two
men. Again they were greeted by a
meal that was singularly appetizing,
jconsiccrinp the limited resources. Obey
inpr Moreau's order, she sat down with
them, but ate nothing, at intervals
starting to her feet to return to the
cabin, then restraining the impulse and
sitting rigid and uncomfortable on the
upturned box. To wait on the men
seemed the only thing she knew how to
do. or that gave her ease in the doing.
The child cried once or twice during
dinner, and. in the afternoc-n. working
In the pit which was in the stream bed
just below the cabin window, Moreau
heard it cry again. It seemed a louder
and more imperious cry than it had
given previously. The miner, -7hose
knowledge of infancy and its ill? Tas of
the most limited, wondered if it could
hf pick.
At sunset, the day's work over, both
men mounted the bank, their takings of
dust in two tin cups, from which it was
transferred to the buckskin sacks in
the box under the bunk. Moreau en
tered the cabin to get the sacks and
found Lucy there curled on the end of
the bunk where the baby slept. As his
great bulk darkened the door she
started up, with her invariable fright
ened look of apology.
"'Don't move â don't move." he said,
kneeling by her: M I want to get the box
under the bunk."
She started up. and being nearer the
box than he. thrust her hand under and
tried to pull it out. It was heavy with
the sacks of dust and required a
wren<--3i. She rose from the effort, cave
b pasi>. and. reding, fell against him.
He cnught her in his arms. and. as her
head fell back against his shoulder saw
that she. was death white and uncon
scious.
With terrified care he laid her on
Fletcher's bunk, and, seizing a pan of
water, sprinkled her face and hand?,
then tore one of the tin cups off its nail,
and, pouring whisky into it, tried to
force it between her lips. A little en
tered her mouth, though most of it ran
down her chin. As he stood staring at
her. Fletcher appeared in the doorway.
"Hullo!" ho paid; "what's the matter
with her? By gum, but she Iook3 bad!"
And then, with a quick and practiced
hand, he pulled her up tcr a sitting pos
ture, and, prying her mouth open with
a. fork, poured some of the whisky
down. It revived her quickly. She sat
up, felt for her sunbonnet, and then
Bald:
"I hadn't oughter have done that, but
It came so quick."
She tried to get up, but Moreau
pushed her back.
"Oh. I ain't sick," she said, trying to
cpeak bravely; "I've been took like that
before. It's just tiredness. I'm all
right now."
She apain tri^d try rise, stood on her
feet for a moment, then reeled back on
the bunk, with white lips.
"It's such a weakness," she whis
pered; "5uch a weakness!"
At this moment the baby woke up,
and. lifting up its voice, began a loud,
violent wail. The woman looked In
terror from one man to the other.
"Oh. my poor baby!" she cried;
**whafll I do? Is that one goin' to go
too?"
"The baby's -p.Jl right." said Moreau.
"Don't be^in to worry about that. All
babies cry, don't they?"
"Oh. my poor baby!" she wailed, un
heeding, and suddenly beginning to
wrins her hands. "It'll die like Willie.
It'll die. too."
"Why should it die? What's the mat
ter with it? It was all right this morn
ing, wasn't it?" he answered, feeling
that there were mysteries here he did
not grasp.
"It'll die because it don't get nothing
to- e-at." she cried desperately. "I've
nothing for it. I'm too sick! I'm too
tick! Ani it'll starve. Oh, my poor
baby: 1
She burst into the wild, weak tears of
exhaustion, her sobs mingling with the
now strident yells of the hungry baby.
The two men looked at each other,
sheepishly, beginning to understand
the situation. The enfeebled condition
of the mother made It impossible for
her to nourish the child. It was a pre
dicament for which even the resource
ful mind of Fletcher had no remedy.
He pushed back his cap, and, scratch

horror-stricken at the magnitude of the
suggestion.
"She might as well ask us to get an

"There's not a goat nearer than San
Francisco."
"And It would take us two weeks
anyway to get one up from there and
across the mountains . from Sacramen
to." said Moreau.
"By the time you got it* here it'd be
the" most expensive goat you ever
bucked up ajgalnst," said his partner
disdainfully.
"A cow!" exclaimed Moreau. "Say,
Lucy, would a cow do?"
"A cow!" came the muffled answer;
"oh. It don't need a whole cow."
"But a cow would do? If I could get
a cow the baby could be fed on the
milk, couldn't It?"
"Oh, yes; It 'ud do first rate."
"Very well, I'll get a cow. Don't you
bother, any more; I'll have a cow here
by to-morrow noon. The baby'll have
to hold out till then, for, not having a
decent horse, I can't get it here any
sooner."
"And where do you calk'Iate to get a
cow?" demanded Fletcher; "cows ain't
much more common ,than goats round
these parts."
"On the Porter ranch. It's twelve
miles off. I can go in to-night, rest
there a bit, and by noon be here with
the cow."
"And is that baby goin' to yell like
this from .now till to-morrow noon?
You might's well ha've a mountain lion
tied up in the bunk."
The difficulty was indeed only half
solved.' The infant's lusty cries were
unabated. The miserable mother, with
tear-drenched face and quivering chin,
sat up In the bunk and tried to rise and
go to It, but was restrained by Mo
reau's hand on her shoulder.
"You stay here and I'll get It," he
said, then crossed to the other bunk,
and gingerly lifted with his huge, hairy
hands the shrieking bundle, from which
protruded two tiny, red fists. Jerking
and clawing about, and carried it to its
mother. Her practiced hand hushed it'
for a moment, but Its pangs were be
yond temporary alleviation, and Its
cries soon broke forth.
"If I get up and mix it some flour and
water," she said, feebly attempting: to
rise.
"What's the matter with us doing
that?" queried Moreau, "How do you
do It? Just give us the proportions and
we'll dish it up as If we were born to
it."
Under her direction he put flour, in
one of the dippers, and handed Fletch-.
er a tin cup with the order to fill It with
water at tha spring. Both men were
deeply interested, and Fletcher rushed
back from the spring with a dripping
cup, as If fearful that the Infant would
die unless the work of feeding was
promptly begun.
"Now go on," said Moreau, armed
with the dipper and a .tin teaspoon;
"what's next?"
"Sugar," she said; "if you put a touch
of sugar in It tastes better to them."
"Here, sugar. Hand It over quick.
Now, there we are. How do you mix
'em, Lucy?"
She gave the directions, while the
men carefully followed, compounding a
white, milky-looking liquid. The cur
cial moment came when they had to
feed this to the crimson and convul
sively. screaming baby.
To forward matters better they
moved two boxes to the doorway,
jV.here the glow of sunset streamed in,
and seated themselves. Fletcher 'with

baby. Both heads were lowered, ' both

faces eagerly earnest when the first
spoonful was administered. It was a
.tense moment till the tip of the spoon
was inserted between the infant's lips.
Her puckered face took on a look of
rather annoyed surprise; she caught at
it,. and then, with an audible smack,
slowly drew in the counterfeit. The
men looked at each other with heated
triumph.
"Takes it like a little man, doesn't
she?" said Moreau proudly.
"She*wasn't hungry," said Fletcher.
"Oh-h, no! Listen to her smack."
. "Here, hold up the dipper. Don't
keep her waiting when she's so blamed
hungry."
"You're spilling half of it. You're
getting it on her clothes."
. "Well, .she don't want to eat any

Look alive there. It's running outer the
corner of her mouth."
"Give us that* bit of flour sack be-
hlna you. We ought to have put some
thins round her neck."
The baby, its round eyes intent, one
small red fist still fanning the air,
sucked noisily at the tip of the spoon.
The mother, sitting up on the bunk in
the background, watched it with craned
neck and Jealous eye.
Finally, when the meal was over, it
was triumphantly handed back to her,
sticky from end to end but sleepy and
satisfied^
A few hours later. In the star-sown
darkness of the early night, Moreau
started on his twelve-mile walk to the
Porter ranch. The next morning", some
time before midday, he reappeared, red
and perspiring, but proudly leading by
a rope a lean and dejected-looking cow.
The problem of the baby's nutriment
was now satisfactorily solved. The
cow proved j eminently fitted for the
purpose of Its purchase, and though
the two miners had several unsuccess
ful bouts in learning to milk It, the
handy Fletcher soon overcame this
difficulty, ' and the stock of the cabin
was augmented by fresh milk. â¢
The baby throve upon this nourish
ment. Its cries no longer disturbed the
serenity of the canyon. It slept and ate
most of the time, but kindly consented
to keep awake â  in the late afternoon
and be grentle and patient when the
men charily passed it from hand to
hand during the rest before supper.
Fletcher regarded it tolerantly as an
object of amusement. But Moreau, es
pecially since the feeding episode, had
developed a deep, delighted affection
for it. Its helplessness appealed to all
that was tender in him, and the first
faint Indications of a tiny formed char
acter were miraculous to his fascinated
and wondering observation. He was
secretly ashamed of letting the sneer
ingly indifferent Fletcher guess his sud
den attachment, and made foolish ex
cuses to account for the trips to the
cabin which frequently interrupted'hls
morning's work, in the stream bed.
Lucy's recovery was slow. The col
lapse from which she suffered was as
much mental as physical. The anguish
of ' the , last two years had preyed on
the bruised spirit as the I hardship of
the Journey had broken the feeble body.
No particular form of ailment devel
oped In her, but she lay for days silent
and almost motionless on the bunk, too
feeble to move or to speak beyond short
sentences. The men watched and
tended her. Moreau with clumsy solici
tude. Fletcher dutifully, but more
through fear of his powerful mate than
especial interest in Lucy as a woman
or a human being.
In his heart he still violently resented
Moreau's action In acquiring her and
parting with the valuable horses. Had
she possessed any of the attractions of
the human female, he could have un
derstood and probably condoned. But
as she now was, plain, helpless, sick,
unable even to cook for them, demand
ing care which took from their work
and lessened their profits, his resent
ment grew instead of diminishing. Mo
reau saw nothing of this, for Fletcher
had long ago read the simple secret of
that generous but impractical nature,
and knew too much to bring down on
himself wrath which, once. aroused, he
felt would be implacable.
At the end of two weeks Lucy began
to show signs of improvement. The
fragrant air that blew through the
cabin, the soothing silence of the foot
hills, broken only by the drowsy prat
tle of the river or the sad murmuring
of the great pine, began its work of
healing. The autumn was late that
year. The days were still warm and
dreamily brilliant, especially in the lit
tle canyon, where the sun drew the aro
matic odors from the pines till at mid
day they exhaled a heavy, pungent
fragrance like incense rising to the
worship of some sylvan god.
Sometimes now, on warm afternoons.
Lucy crept out and sat at the root of
the pine where she had found her first
place of refuge. There her dulled eyes
began to note the beauties that sur
rounded her, the pines mounting in
dark rows on the slope?, the glimpses
of chaste, white summits far above
against the blue. Her lungs breathed
deep of the revivifying air, clean and
untainted as the water in the little
spring at her feet. The peace of it all
entered her soul. Something in her for
bade her to look back on the terrible
past. A new life was here, and her
youth rose up and whispered that it
was not yet dead. Â«
During the period of her illness Mo
reau had begun to see both himself and
the cabin through feminine eyes. Dis
crepancies revealed tnemselves. Â» He
wanted many things heretofore regard
ed as luxuries. From the tin cup of the
table service to the towels made of
ripped "flour sacks, his domestic ar
rangements seemed mean and inade
quate. They were all right for two
prospectors, but not fitting for a wo
man and child. Lucy's illness also re
vealed wants in her equipment that
struck him as piteous. Her only hoots
were the ones he had seen her in on
the morning after her arrival. She had
no shawl or covering for cold weather.
The baby's clothes were a few torn
pieces of calico and flannel. Moreau
had washed these many times himself,
doing them up in an old flour sack,
which was attached to an aspen on the
deepest parts of the mrrent. Here it
remained for two days, the percolating
water cleansing its contents as no
washboard ciÂ»uld.
One evening, smoking under the pfne,
he acquainted Fletcher with a design
he had been some days fromulating.
This was that Fletcher should ride Into
Hangtown the next day and not only
replenish the commissariat, but buy all
things needful for Lucy and the baby.
Spotty was now also- recovered, and,
though hardly a mettlesome steed, was
at least a useful pack horse. But the
numerous list of articles suggested by
Moreau would have weighted Spotty to
the ground. So Fletcher was commis
sioned to bÂ»iy a pack burro, and upon it
to bring all needful food stuffs for the
cabin and the habiliments for Lucy
and the baby.
"She's got no shoes. You want to
buy her some shoes, one useful pair
and one fancy pair with heels."
"What size do I git? I ain't never
bought shoes for a woman before."
This was a poser, and both men cog
itated till Moreau suggested leaving it
to the shoe dealer, who should be told
that Lucy was a woman of average
size.
"But her feet ain't." said Fletcher
spitefully, never having been able to
forgive Lucy her lack of beuaty.
"Never mind; you'll have to make a
bluff at it. Get the best you can. Then
I want a shawl for her. It'll be cold
soon, and she's got nothing to keep her
warm."
"What kind of a shawl? I don't know
no more about shawls than I do about
shoes."
"A pink crochet shawl," said Moreau
slowly, and with evident sheepish re
luctance at having to make this exhibi
tion of unexpected knowledge.
"And what's that* I dunno what
crochet is."
"I den't, either"â and then, with des
perate courageâ "well, anyway, that's
what she said she'd like. I asked her
yesterday and she said that. You go
into the store and ask for it. That'll
be enough."
Fletcher grunted.
"And then I want Eome toys for the
kid. Anything you can pet that seems
the right kind. She's a girl, so you
don't want a drum, or soldiers, or guns,
or things of that Jtind. Get a doll if
you can, and a musical box, or any
thing tasty and* that's likely to catch
a baby's eye."
"Why, she can't hardly see yet. She's
like a blind kitten. Lucy told me her
self yesterday she were only six weeks
old."
"Never you mind. She's a smart kid;
knows more now than most babies at
six months. Tou might get a rattleâ
a nice one -with bells; she might fancy
that."
"Silver or gold?" sneered Fletcher,
whom this conversation was making
meditative.
"The best you can get. Don't stint
yourself for money; everything of the
best. Then clothes for her; she is going
to be as well, dressed as any baby In
California. I take it you'd better go to
Mrs. Wingate, at the Eldorado Hotel,
and get her to make you out a list; then
go to the store and buy the list. right
down."
"Seems to me you'll Want a pack
train, not a burro, to carry it all."
"Well, if you can't get everything on
Spotty and one burro, buy two. I'll
give you a sack of dust and you can
spend it all."
Fletcher -was silent after this, and as
he lay rolled In his blanket that night
he looked at the stars for many hours,
thinking. \
Early in the morning he departed en
the now brisk and rejuvenated Spotty.
Besides his instructions he carried one
of Moreau's buckskin sacks, roughly es
timated to contain twelve hundred dol
lars* worth of dust,* and, he told Mo
reau, one of his own. He was due to
return the next morning:. With a short
word of forewell. he touched Spotty
with the single Mexican spur he wore,
and darted away down the rough trail.
Moreau watched him out of sight.
The day passed as quickly as its pre
decessors. The main events that
marked their course had been the men's
clean-up. Lucys gain in strength and
the evidences of increasing intelligence
in the child.
To-day Lucy had walked to a point a
little distance up the canyon, rested
there, and in the afternoon came creep
in- back with the Hush of returmnpr
health on her face. It was still there
when Moreau ascended from the stream
hod with his cup. He had had a good
daVs work .find was J-jyful taming
the fine yellow grains in the bottom of
the rusty tin. Then he neticed her im
proved appearance and cried:
"Why you look blooming. A f?l
low'd think you'd panned a good day's
work, too."
To himself he said with a sudden in
ward wonder:
"She looks almost pretty. And she is
only 19 I believe."
The next mc-rnincr he awaited the
coming of Fletcher with impatience. He
had wanted to surprise Lucy, having
only told her Fletcher had gone to buy
a burro and some supplies- But the
morning passed away and he had not
returned. Then the afternoon slipped
by. and Lucy and Moreau took their
supper without him, the latter rather
taciturn. The delay wore on his pa
tience. His knowledge of Fletcher was
limited. He had seen him ilrunk once
in Sacramento, and he wondered if he
had gone on a spree and was now ly
ing senseless somewhere, the contents
of the sacks squandered.
"When the next morning had passed
and Fletcher had still not come, his
suspicions strengthened and he began
to think uneasily of his dust. One sack
full was a good deal to lose, now that
he had a woman and child on his hands.
Lucy, he could see. was also uneasy.
Twice he surprised her standing by the
trail, evidently listening. When even
ing drew on and there were no signs
of him.- both were frankly anxious and
oppressed. Suddenly, a3 they sat by
the box that answered as dinner table,
she said:
"Did he have much du3t?"
â¢Â«Yes â one sack of mine and one of his
own. They're equal to about twelve
hundred dollars each."
She gave a startled look at him and
sat with her mouth a little open, fear
and amaze on her face.
"Where's the rest?" she asked.
Moreau indicated the box under tha
bunk. At the same moment her sus
picion seized him and he pulled it out
and threw up the lid. It was empty of
all save a few clothes. Every sack was
gone.
Moreau shut down the lid quietly, a
little pale. He was not a man of quick
mind, and he hardly ceuld realize what
had happened. It was Lucy'3 voice
that explained it as she said:
"He" did It while I was out in the
morning. I went up the stream to that
pool to wash some things at sun up.
He took it then."
CHAPTER IV.
THE ENCHANTED WINTER.
"I choose to be yours for my proper part.
Tours, leave me or take, or mar or make;
If I acquiesce, why should you ba teased
With the conscience prick and the memory
smart?" â Browning.
Fletcher had gone silently and with
out leaving a trace, and with him the
money. It was a startling situation for
Moreau. From comparative affluence
he suddenly found himself without a
cent or an ounce of dust. This, had he
had only himself to look after would
not have affected his free and Jovial
spirits, but now the woman and the
child he had so carelessly come into
possession of loomed before him In
their true light of a heavy responsibil
ity. Lucy, as far as supporting herself
went, was still a long way off from the
state of health where that would bo
possible. And at the thought of send
ing her forth, even though she were
cured of her infirmities, Moreau experi
enced a sensation of depression. He
felt that the cabin would be unbearably
lonely when she and the baby were
gone.
That night under the pine ha turned
over the situation in his mind. The
conclusion he arrived at was that there
was nothing better to be done than stay
by the stream bed and work It for all
it was worth. Lucy would continue to
improve in the fine air and the child
was thriving. If the snows would hold
off till late, as they had dono In the
open winter of '50. he could amass a
fair share of dust before it would ba
necessary to move Lucy and the baby
to the superior accommodations of
Hangtown or Sacramento. It was now
October. In November one might ex
pect the first snows.
He must do a sood deal In thÂ» next
six weeks. This he started to do. Tha
next day he spent In raising a brush
shed against the back of the cabin
where the chimney would offer warmth
on cold nights. Into this he moved
such few belongings as ho had retained
after Lucy and the baby had taken
possession of the cabin. Then tha
working of the stream, bed went on
with renewed vigor. Tha water wa3
low, hardly more than a thread, render
ing the washing of the dirt harder
labor than during the earlier summer
when the water courses were still full.
But he toiled mightily, rejoicing In
the splendor of his man's work, not
with the same knightly freedom that ha
felt when he had been that king of men.
the miner with his pick on hl3 shoulder
and all the- world before him. but with
the soberer Joy of the man into whose
life others have entered to lay hold
upon It with light, clinging hands.
Against the complete and perfect
loneliness of his life the woman and
child, who- had started up from no
where, stood out as figures of vital
significance. They had grown closer to
him In that one month's isolation than
they would have done In a year of city
life. The child became the object of his
secret but deep devotion. He had been
ashamed to let Fletcher see It. Now
that Fletcher was gone, Moreau often
stole up from his work In the creek to
look at it as it sleep in a box by the
open door. It was as fresh as a rose
bud, Its skin clean Â«~nd satiny, its tiny
hands, crumpled, white and pink, like
the petals of flowers. The big man
leaned on his shovel to watch it ador
ingly. The miracle of its growth in
beauty never lost its wonder for him.
Lucy, too. grew and bloomed in these
quiet autumn days. Never talkative,
she became less laconic after the de
parture of Fletcher. She seemed re
lieved by his absence. Moreau begun
to understand, as he saw her daily In
crease in freshness and youthful
charm, that she was as young In na
ture as she was in years. Points of
character that were touchlngly child
ish appeared in her. Her casting of all
responsibility on him was as absoluteÂ«â¢ If she had been ten years of age.

â¢*Â«! ho heard a laugh rising from a
nnaÂ« knoll among the aspens. It was
LUffh of the most infectious, fresh
siveftrc&s. and made ttoreau's own lips
Part. He stole in its direction, and as
nÂ« advanced it sounded again, rippling
Â«.icioualy cm the crystal air. He

B-nraercd by its mother with a run of
the !ai:slm-r MÂ« roau had heard.
â¢ He looked at Them for a moment, and
then, advancing, his f<Â«Â»t cracked a dry
branch, pr.d Lucy turned. Her face
Was Hushed, her eyes Ftill fu!! of their
pad merriment, her smiling lips looked
a coral red against the whiteness of
hfr small, even teeth. Her runbonnct
was off and her rich hair gkrwed like
copper in the <un. He had never seen
her lock like this, and stopped, regard
ing hn- uith curious, sudden gravity.
The thought was in his heart:
"She's only a girl, andâ andâ almost
beautiful."
L/iuy looked confused.
"Oh. I was just laughing at the
brny." F h c said apologetically; "she
looked so sorter cute smiling that
way."
"I never heard you laugh like that be
fore. Why don't you do it oftener?"
She seemed embarrassed and mur
mured:
"1 didn't think you'd like to hear me."
"I think you're sometimes afraid of
me." he said; " is that true?"
She bent her face over the baby and
eald very low:
"I'm afraid as how you might get
mad at me. I don't know much and â
I'm different, and you've been more
Coed to me than â "
She stopped, her face hidden over the
child. Moreau felt a sudden" sense of
embarrassed discomfort.
"Oh, don't talk that way." he said,
hastily, -'or I may get mad. That's the
sort of talk that annoys me. Laugh
Bjr.d be happy â that's the way I want
you to be. Enjoy yourself; that's the
way to please me."
He swung: himself down from the
kr.oll into the cree<k bed and went back
to his rocker. He found it hard to col
lect his thoughts. The music of Lucy's
laugh haunted him.
A week, and then two. passed away.
The golden days slipped by, still
scented with the healing pine balsam.
The nights were white with great stars,
which Moreau could see between the
pine boughs, for it was still warm
Â«=nough to Eleen on the knoll. His
nights' rests were now often disturbed.
A change had come over ths situation
in ihe cabin. The peace and serenity of
the first days after Fletcher's depart
ure had gone, leaving a sense of con
straint and uneasiness In their stead.
Mcreau now looked up at the stars not
with the calm content of the days
when Lucy had first come, but with the
trouble of a man who begins to realize
menace in what he thought were harm
less things.
Nearly a month l.ad passed since
Fletchers departure when one day.
walking down the stream with an idea
of trying diggings farther down, he
came upon Lucy washing in a pool of
water enlarged by a rough dam she
herself had constructed. She was
kneeling on a flat stone on the bank,
her sunbonnet off, her sleeves rolled up,
laving in the water the few articles of
dress that made up the baby's ward
robe. Her arms above the sunburned
wrists shone snow white, her roughened
hair lay low on her forehead in damp,
curly strands. The Eight of her en
paged in his menial toll irritated Mo
reau and he called:
"What are you doing there, Lucy?
Get up."
She started with one of her old ner
vous movements and sat back on the
etone. Then, seeing who it was. smiled
confidently, and brushed the hair back
from her forehead with one wet hand.
"I was washing the baby's things.
That's the dam I made."
Moreau stood looking, not at the dam,
but at the woman, flushed, breathless
and smiling, a blooming girl.
"N"o one would ever think you were
the same woman who came here two
months ago," he said, more to himself
than to her.
"I don't feel like the same." she an
swered, beginning to wring her clothes.
"I don't feel now as If that was me."
"I thought you were quite an old wo
man then- Do you know that? I'd no
Idea you were young.
"I felt old. Oh, God!" she said, sud
denly dropping her hands and looking
acros's the pool r with darkly reminiscent
e yesâ "how awful I felt!"
"But you're quite well now? You're
really well, aren't you?" he asked.
"Oh. I'm all right." she said, return
ing to her tone of gayety. "I ain't
never been like this before. Not sense
I was married, anyway."
The allusion to her marriage made
Moreau wince. Of late the subject had
become hateful to him. Standing, lean
ing on his shovel, he said:
-You know it'U be winter here soon,
so it's a good thing we've got you well
and nicely rested up."
"Yes I guess 'twill be winter soon,

Itwwrr . I ,
-Sometimes tons of it. if it's a hard
winter. But we've got to get out be
fore that. Or you have, anyhow. Can t
run any risks with the baby. Got to
get her out and Into some decent shel
ter before the snow falls."
For a moment Lucy made no answer.
Fhe had stopped wringing the clothes
and was kneeling on the stone, her eyes
on the water, a faint line drawn be
tween her brows.
"Where toâ? What sort o' place.
6 he raid 6lowly.
Mores u shifted his eyes from her face
to the earth in which the point of his
ehovel had imbedded itself.
"I told you as soon as you got well
T'd take you to Hangtown or Sacra
mento, or even 'Frisco If they didn't
suit Sow I haven't got dust enough
to do that. Fletcher put that spoke in
my wheel. But I'll take you and the
baby into Hangtown."
â¢â¢Hangtown?" she repeated faintly.
"Yes- it's quite a ways off. I'll have
t o go in myself and get a horse first,
md then I'll take you both in on that.
I thought I'd so to Mrs. Wingate. Her
husband runs the Eldorado Hotel, and
she isn't strong, and told me last time
I was there she'd give a fancy salary
if she could get a housekeeper. How'd
you like to try that? It would be a
first-class home for you and the baby."
Lucy had bent her face over the wet
clothes.
"Ain't it all right here?" she said in a
scarcely audible voice.
'"No." said Moreau irritably; "I just
told you there was danger of being
sne-wed in after the first of November.
You don't want to be snowed in here
With the baby, do you?" â¢ *
"1 don't care," said Lucy.
"If you don't feel strong enough to
do work like that." he continued, "you
can stay on In the hotel. I can make
the dust for that easily. Then in the
spring, when the streams are full. I'll
have er.c-ugh to send you to Sacra
mento or San Francisco, and you can
look about you and see how you'd like
it there,*;
"Why can't I stay here?" she said
suddenly, her voice quavering, but full
of protest.
Its rote thrilled Moreau.
"I've Just told you why,** he said
quietly.
"Well, I'm not afraid. I don't mind
Â«sn>-\v. You can get. things to eat from
H.ingtown. Oh. let me stay."
She turned toward him. still kneeling
on the stone. Her face was quivering
with the most, violent emotions he had
ever seen on it. The dead apayiy was
gone forever, at least as far a3 he was
concerned.
"Oh. let me stay," she implored;
"don't send me away from you."
"Oh. Lucy," he almost groaned,
"don't you see that won't do?"
"Let me stay," she reiterated, and
stretched out her hands toward him.
The tears began to pour down her
cheeks, and suddenly with the out
stretched hands she seized him, and
burst forth into a stream of impas
sioned words:
"Let me stay. Let me be with you.
Don't send me away. There ain't no
use in anything if I'm not with you.
Let me work for you. Let me be where
I can see you â that's all I want. I
don't want no money nor clothes. If
you'll just let me be near by! And I kin
always work and cook, and you know
you like things clean, and I kin keep
'em clean. Oh. you can't mean to send
me off. I ain't never been happy be
fore. I ain't never had no one to treat
me so kind before. I ain't never known
what It was like to be treated decent.
I can't leave you â I can't â I can't â "
She sank down at his feet in a quiver
ing heap.
Moreau raised her and held her in his
arms, pressed against his breast, his
cheek against her hair. He had no
thought for the moment but an ecstasy
of pity and joy. Clinging close to him,
she reiterated between broken breaths:
'I kin stay? Oh! I kin stay?"
"Lucy," he said, "how can you? Do
you know what you're asking?"
'But I kin stay?" she repeated.
She siid one arm round his neck, and
he felt her wet cheek against his.
"Let me just stay and work," she
whispered, "just where I can see you."
"Do you forget that you're married?"
he said huskily.
"I'll not be in your way. I'll not ask
for anything or be any trouble." was
her whispered answer, " so long's you
let me be near you."
They walked back to the cabin si
lently.. Lucy knew that she had gained
her point and would stay. Her child
ish nature invaded and possessed by a
great passion built on gratitude and
reverence, asked no more than to be
allowed to work and worship the man
who was to her a god. She did not look
into the future, nor demand its secrets.
The perfect Joy of the present filled her.
In the days that followed she grew in
beauty, and In some subtile way -ac
quired a new girlishness. Her past
seemed wiped out. The blighting ef
fects of the four previous years fell
away from her and she seemed to re
vert to the sweet and simple youthful
ness that had been hers when Jake
Shackleton had married her at St.
Louis. Silent and gentle as ever, it was
plain to be seen that whatever Moreau
asked for â service, friendship, love â she
would unquestloningly give.
Early In November a cold evening
came with a red sunset and a sharpen
lng*of every outline. For the first time
they were driven into the cabin for sup
per. A fire of boughs and dried cones
burned in the chimney and before this,
supper being over, they sat, Lucy In
the rocker made of a barrel, Moreau on
the end of an upturned box, staring at
the flames.
Finally the man broke the silence by
teling her that he was going to take his
dust and walk Into Hanstown the next
day, remaining there over night and re
turning In the morning with fresh sup
plies and a burro.
"Lucy." he said, drawing his- box
nearer to her, "I want to talk to you of
something."
She looked up, saw that the moment
both had been dreading had come, and
paled.
"Lucy, the winter's coming. The
snow may be here now at any moment.
Have you thought of what we're to
do?" -
She shook her head and began to
tremble. His words called up the
specter of separationâ what she feared
most in the world.
"You know we can't live on this way.
Will you, if I go into Hangtown and
bring back a mule, ride there with me
the day after to-morrow and marry
me? There are two or three preachers
there who will do it."
She looked at him with surprised
eyes.
"I'm married already to Jake," she
said. "How kin I get married again?"
"I know it, and it's no good trying to
break that marriage. But In your eyes
and mine that was none. You and your
baby are mine to take care of and
support and love for the rest of our
lives. Though you can't be my lawful
wife, I can protect you from scandal
and insult by making you what all the
world will think Is my lawful wife.
Only you, and I and Jake and his sec
ond wife will know that there has been
a previous marriage and not one of that
four will ever tell."
She put her rough hand out and felt
his great fist close over it, like a sym
bol of the protection he was offering*
her.
"We can be married in Hangtown by
your maiden name. If any one asks I
can say I am marrying a young widow
whose husband died on the Sierra.
Your husband did die there when he
6rfd you to me for a pair of horses."
She nodded, not quite understanding
his meaning.
"Kin Jake ever come and claim me?"
she asked in a frightened voice.
"How could he? How could he dare
tell the world how he left you and his
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL!.
child sick, almost dying, in tne hut of
an unknown miner in the foothills?
This is California, where men don't for
give that sort of thing."
She was silent, and then said: "Yes,
let's go to Hangtown and be married."
"Was your first marriage perfectly
legal? Have you got the marriage cer
tificate?"
She rose, dragged out the bundle she
had brought with her, and from it
drew a long dirty envelope which she
handed to him.
He opened it and found the certifi
cate. It was accurate In every detail.
His eye ran over the ages and names of
the contracting partiesâ Lucy Fraser,
15, to Jacob Shackleton, 24, at St. Louis.
Twisting the paper in his hands he
sat moodily eying the fire. The second
marriage was the only way he could
think of by which he could lend a sem
blance of right to the impossible posi
tion in which his generous action had
placed him. Divorce, In that, remote
locality and at that early day of laws,
half administered and chaotic, was Im
possible, and even had it been easily
obtained he shrank from dragging into
publicity the piteous story of how the
woman he loved had been sold to him.
That a marriage with Jake Shackle
ton's wife was a legal offense he knew,
but with one of those strange whimsies
of character which mark mankind, he
felt that the reading of the marriage
service over Lucy and himself would in
some way sanctify what could never be
a lawful tie. â¦
In a spasm of rage and disgust he
held out the paper to the flames, when
Lucy, with a smothered cry sprang for
ward and seized it. It was the first
violent action into which he had ever
seen her betrayed. He looked in sur
prise Into her flushed and alarmed face.
"Why not? Why not destroy every
thing that could connect you with such
a past?" he said, almost angrily.
She hesitated, smoothing out the
paper with trembling hands. Then she
said falteringly:
"I don't knowâ butâ butâ he was her
father," Indicating the sleeping baby.
"I was married to'him all right." .
He understood the instinct that made
her wish to keep the paper aÂ» a record
of her child's legitimacy, and made no
further comment. '* â¢
The next morning at dawn he started
for his long a walk Into Hangtown, tak
ing with him all the dust he had accu
mulated since Fletcher's departure. He
was absent till the afternoon of the
following day, when he reappeared
leading a small pack mule, laden with
supplies, among which were several ar
ticles of dress for Lucy and the baby,
so that they might make a fitting ap
pearance when they rode into camp for
the wedding. Lucy was overjoyed at
her finery, and arrayed In it looked so
pretty and so girlish that Moreau, for
the first time since the scene by the
creek, took her in his arms and kissed
her. It was the kiss of the bridegroom
and the master.
The next morning when she woke the
cabin was curiously dark. Going to the
door to open it, she found it resisted,
and went to the window. The world
was wrapped in a blinding fall of snow.
When Moreau came In for breakfast, he
reported a blizzard outside. The cold
was intense, the wind high, and the
snow so fine and so torn by the gale
that It was like a mist of whiteness en
veloping the cabin. Already it was
piled high about the walls and had to
be shoveled from the door to permit of
Its opening. Fortunately they had col
lected a large amount of fire wood
which was piled in the ' brush shed in
which the man lived. Duringthemorn
ing Moreau took the animals from their
shelter and stabled them in his. There
was fodder for them and a bed of
leaves, and the heat of the chimney
warmed the fragile hut.
All day the storm raged, and In the
evening, as he and Lucy sat before the
fire, they could hear the turmoil of the
tempest outside, moaning through, the
ranks of the sentinel, pines. They were
silent, listening to this shouting of the
unloosed elements, and feeling an in
describably sweet sense of home and
shelter in their rugged cabin and each
other's society. ,.';!;;
The storm was one of those unex
pected blizzards which sometimes visit
the Sierras in the early winter. "With
brief Intervals . of sunshine, the snow
fell oft and on for nearly a month.
Moreau had. to exercise almost super
human effort to keep the cabin from be
ing burled, and, as it was, the drifts
nearly covered, the window. It was im-

possible to travel any distance, as the
snow was c-f a fine, feathery texture
which did not pack tight, and into
which the wanderer sank to the arm
pits. Fortunately the last trip into
Hangtown had stocked the cabin well
with provisions. No cares menaced its
inmates, who, warm and happy in the
vast snow-buried solitudes of the
mountains, led an enchanted existence,
forgetting and forgotten by the world.
When the storm ended the miner at
tempted to get into the settlements
with the mule. But the beast, ex
hausted by the insufficient food, as the
best part of the fodder had to be given
to the cow, fell by the way, dying In
one of the drifts. This seemed to sever
their last link with the world. Nature
had drawn an unbroken circle of, lone
liness around them^ Under its spell
they were drawn closer together till
their. lives mergedâ the primitive man
and woman living for and by love in
the primitive wilderness.
So the enchanted winter passed. The
man, at intervals, making his way into
the settlements for food and the few
articles of clothing that they needed. It
was a terrible winter, nearly as fierce
as that of '46, but between the storms
Moreau fitfully worked the stream, ob
taining: enough dust to pay for their
provisions. The outside world seemed
to fade from their lives, which were
bounded by the walls of the cabin.
Here, In the long fire-lit evenings, Mo
reau read to Lucy, taught her from his
few books, strove to develop the mind
that misfortune had almost crushed.
She. responded to his teachings with the
quickness of love. Without much men
tal ability she Improved because she
lived only for what he desired. She
smoothed the roughness of her speech
and studied to correct her grammati
cal errors. She made him set her little
tasks such as a child studies, and in the
evenings he watched her with surrepti
tious amusement, as she conned over
her" spelling, or traced letters In her
copy-book. She wa3 passionately desir
ous of being worthy, of him.. and of
leaving her old chrysalis behind her
when she Issued from the cabin.
This was not to be until the early
spring. It was nearly six months from
the jj time the emigrant wagon had
stopped at his. door, that Moreau, hav
ing accumulated' enough dust to buy
another mule and another outfitâtook
Lucy and. the child into Hangtown for
the marriage. This ceremony, about
which in the beginning she had been
somewhat apathetic, she now earnestly
desired. It was accomplished without
publicity or difficulty, Lucy assuming
her maiden name of Fraser, and pos
ing as a young widow. In the after
noon they started back for the cabin,
Moreau on foot, with his wife and baby
on the mule. They had decided to stay
by their claim during the spring and
early summer when the streams were
high.
ThU3 the spring passed and the sum
mer came. During this season Lucy.

for the first time, saw the most lovely
of Callfornian wild flowers, the mari
posa lily, a.Â»d called her baby after It.
As time went on and no other child was
born, Moreau came to regard the little
Marlposa as mere and more hla own.
His affection for her became a paternal
passion. It was decided between him
self and Lucy that she should never
know the secret of her parentage, but
be called by his name and be brought
up as his child. As the happiness of the
union grew in d*Â»nth and strength both
the man and woman desired more ar
dently to forget beyond all recall tha
terrible past from which she had en
tered his life. It grew to be a subject
to which ile-reau could bear no allu
sion, and their life was purposely quiet
and secluded, for fear of a chance en
counter with some disturbing reminder.
So the time pa.-s-'d. In the course of
the next few years aioreau moved from
the smaller camps into Sacramento.
Though a man of little commercial
ability, he v.as always able. In those
halcyon day?, to make a good living for
the woman and child to whom he had
given his life. Years of prosperity
marie it possible to give to Mariposa
every educational advantage the period
and town offered. The child showed
musical talent, and for th develop
ment of this he wag keenly ambitious.
Across their tranquil life, now and
then, came a lurid gleam from the ca
reer of the man who was Lncy Mnreau'3
lawful husband. Jake Shackleton was
soon a marked figure In the new State.
But his rise to sensational fortune be
gan with the booming days of the Corn
stock. Then his star rose blazing above
the horizon. He was one of the origi
nal exploiters of the great lode and- was
one of those who owned that solid cone
of silver which has gone down to his
tory as the Reydcl Monte. Ten years
from his entrance into the State he was
a rich man. In twenty, he was one of
that group of millionaires, whose
names were sounded from end to end of
an astonished country.
A quarter of a century from the timÂ«
when he had crossed the desert in an
emigrant wagon, with his two wives,
he read in the paper he had recently
bought as an occupation and invest
ment, a notice of the death of Daniel
Moreau in Santa Barbara. It was
brief, as befitted a pioneer who had
gunk so completely out of sight and
memory, leaving neither vast wealth
nor picturesque record. The para
graph stated that "the pioneer devoted
wife and daughter attended his last
hours, which were tranquil and free
from pain. It is understood that the
deceased leaves but little fortune, hav
ing during the last two nr three years
been incapacitated for work by enfee
bled health."
CHAPTER I.
Mast thou found me. O mine enemies? â Kings.
Four months after the death of Dan
Moreau his adopted daughter. Mari
posa, sat at the piano. In a small cot
tage on Pine street, in San Francisco,
singing. Her performance was less me
lodious than remarkable, for she wa3
engaged in "trying her voice." This
was Marlposa's greatest claim to dis
tinction, and, she hoped, to fortune.
With It she dreamed of conquering
fame and bringing riches to her mother
and herself.
She was so far from either of these
goals that she permitted herself to
speculate on them as one does on im
possible glories. The merits of her
voice were as unknown In San Fran
cisco as she was. Its cultivation had
been a short and exciting episode, re
linquished for lack of means. Now It
was not only given up. but Mariposa
was teaching piano herself, and wa3
feverishly exalted when, the week be
fore, her three pupils had been aug
mented by a fourth. Four pupils, at
fifty cents a lesson, brought in $4 a
weekâ $16 a month.
"If I make $16 a month after four
months' work," Mariposa had said tr>
her mother, on the acquisition of thi3
fourth pupil, "then in one year I ought
to make $32 a month. Don't you think
that's a reasonable way of reckoning?'*
From which It will be seen that Mari
posa was not only young in years, but
a novice at the work of wage-earning.
She was in reality 1Z years of age. but
passed as. and believed herself to be 24.
She had de'veloped Into one of those
lordly women, stately of carriage, wide
of shoulder and deep of breast, that
California grows so triumphantly.

The words were uttered laughingly,
but there was a significant look in the
keen, gray eyes that betrayed his earn
estness of purpose. There were vary
ing exclamations of surprise from six
of his hearers. The seventh remained
scornfully silent. The others looked
from one to another questloningly.

Converse, turning to the silent one;
"can we go to-morrow?"
"After 1 o'clock," she replied, quiet

look of understanding and defiance, "If
you will wait until the next day, Satur

"We will go to-morrow," he de
cided quickly.
"How can you spare the time for
Bight-seeing, Mr. Converse?" queried
the artist, teasingly. "I should think
you would want every hour of the
week for your wooing."
"I shall waste no time in my sight

marked emphasis, "and you must un
derstand that a western wooing is less
deliberate than is usually considered
necessary in New England. There are

out a faded photograph. "See, Dick,

He looked at it curiously and laughed

"The boy, you mean. I must have
been about twenty then. Pretty, ' little
fellow, wasn't I? Aren't those curling
locks poetical?" /.'
She put the picture away hastily.
"You had the soul of a poet then,"
she cried, resentfully.
"That Is twenty years ago, Eleanor,
and I've had some hard battles with
the world since then. The poetry Ys
pretty, well battered out of me, I con
fess; but you might go home with me
and. put some poetry, into my life once
more."

"Say it, Eleanorâ too fat, I suppose
you mean." .
"Not exactly," desperately, "but you
are too prosperous, and too well-satis

"I admit the prosperity, and I have

needed nothing* more to make my life
full and complete. Now, I want you."

"You are old enough to have ac

soriously, "How old are you, by the

"Born exactly forty-nine years and

"I,. don't object. to ; -J.haW leniently:";

began.
"You seem proud to enumerate them.
You might knock off five without any

air. of an expeiT.
"Simple honesty shouldn't be caught
embezzling," she smiled, with a sense
of good comradeship, her hands relax
ed from their grip on the chair and fell
more, comfortably upon her lap.
"Didn't the other three think it
would be rather nice?" He looked
meaningly at the hand nearest him.
"I don't [think 1 anybody ever wanted
to," she answered simply. "I look too
much like the sturdy oak. and have
received none of the tenderness that
falls to the lot of clinging vines. Of
course there are storms from which the

No one would have recognized the

the crowd and making her way to the

, "The 3:30 train!" she gasped, paus

."Just gone, madam; it is too

She did not wait .to hear his cour

information bureau.
"Where is the. first stopâ this 3:30

"Trinity Place," mechanically; "leav

mistaken for a giddy elephant."
â¢ "Precisely," he agreed.
"But even a feminine elephant might
long to be admired occasionally, and
âloved."
'"Didn't the. other 'three everâ" he
gently stroked the firm, white hand.
"They didn't want to,", she blushed
â¢furiously. . ' >;
"But why, then-â" he commenced.
"Oh â one of them was a .widower
and said it was so^jexpensive having
all the sewing done"but for four chil

He frov.ncd .sympathetically.
"The second . wanted a partner to

that I would jump at the chance.
None of them, nobody in all my life

- Her eyes were full of tears. "I
would like some one to love me as
they do the pretty little woman. I
am just as affectionate and tender
hearted as if I were little and dainty,"
her lip quivered, "and â I want â -to be
loved â and to be â like them." She
covered her face with her hnnds.
He sat down on the arm of the Mor

and youthful.
"Dear little" woman," he said, ignor

by sobs were broad as his own, "the

to. slay them for you, one by one, but,

their lack of appreciation left a chance

hair gently from her forehead. "The
fourth man loves you," he said, with a
simplicity of words strong in feeling.
She slowly raised her head and
.looked In his face. In her eyes .was
shining the same expression that men
have often seen in the eyes of those

Amazon sank into insignificance, the
woman came into her own triumph

"My Lady" is Grace Ormonde. I
don't know who first called her that,
but she had all the airs and graces of
the lady of the manor. All of us
called hw,"My Lady," but the posses
sive case appealed particularly to me.
I wanted to make her "My Lady" in
fact, as, in truth, she had been ever
since the day when, as a boy in my
first long trousers, I awoke to a realiza
tion that Grace was the nicest girl I
knew.
Everv one used to. laugh at us when
we both were children, because old
Mrs. Ormonde, Grace's grandmother,
approved the match. As the old lady
had the money, the rest all approved
of what she approved. Then she went
away; just about that time the poor
old pater lost his money in the Nine
. teenth National crush, and Mr. Or
monde had a little chat with me about
what he called our "childish Infatua
tion." .
He was proud, he said, to know that
his old friend (that was poor Dad)
was willing to sacrifice his private for
tune because the bank had been
wrecked while he was Its president. But
I must see that it was impossible that
â er -
I assured him that I did see, before
he had had a chance to find a nice
sounding word to replace the "er," and
I went down to the bank and rode
home with dad, prouder than ever that
he hadn't made money his fetich.
Then I had a chance to make some
money. Poor father did not long sur
vive the bank crash. He wasn't re
sponsible, but somehow he seemed to
feel that it was a disgrace. Mother
had some money, and I got a chance,
with Bert Taylor, on a patent that in
a few years will make us more than
merely rich. It was hard work at first,
but we hustled like ten-dollar-a-week
men, and now we are pretty well along.
. As soon as I could see things clear,
I put my pride in my. pocket and went
to ol i man Ormonde. I told him that
I was going to make a pile for myself
and asked him if he would hold the
other fellows" off for a couple of years.
He was awfully nice about It. with
that greasy kind of niceness that keeps
you from kicking a man when you
want to most. He reeled out a lot of
talk about his duty toward his daugh
ter (as though her happiness should
not be the first consideration), and ex
plained that a gentleman he had met
in England was just then on his way
to press his suit. From the way he
rolled the name. Lord Lancaster, un
der his toncue, I could see it was the
title he was after. I went out of the
room with black rage in my heart, and
the bitter memory of things I had said
to a man old enough to be my father.
If there ever was a man I wanted to
hateâ after Ormonde, of courseâ it was
Lancaster. But after I had met him I

ting them off by themselves, and he
knew it was asking a lot of a hand
some and imperious'girl to live in the
house with them and accommodate
her ways to theirs. So, though he had
an understanding with Ellie, there
was -no set engagement. He had let
her know how-he found himself held
and hampered, and was waiting for
her to study out the problem. She
had known that he loved her ever
since she was out of short frocks.
"Jack, I reckon you'll get a mitten,
may be a pair of 'emâ for Christmas,"
Polly Exum said in his ear, as he shook
hands. Polly was a bouncing flaxen
beauty, always laughing, with the
kindest heart in the world, and the
most reckless tongue. ; She made no
bones of letting it be known that she
"loved Jack Jimmerson better'n pie"â
also that it was quite a hopeless love
so long as Ellie Andrews was single.
"I'll git over It and marry somebody â
a preacher, may be," she said to Jack
himself. Therefore . his conscience
was quite easy regarding her, al
though it often seemed to him matri
monial providence had made a big mis
take. Why did not Pollyâ pretty,
laughing Pollyâ love the rich Tom
Wilson? Why, also, did not Tom Wil
son yearn to bestow himself and his
belongings on her, rather than on El
lie? But he kept his speculations to
himself, and answered, squeezing Pol
ly's hand hard: "Why, who has cut
me out with you. Polly? I never
thought you'd go back on a fellow this
fashion!"
He tried to speak reproachfully, but
wrath got the mastery. Polly giggled
comprehendingly. "You know what I
meant." she said. Then with a little
toss of her head, "There! Tom's done
catched Ellie. He'll snap me dead sure
âand I'll snap you. That'll give you a
chance â If you ain't too bashful to
use it." . . .
True enough, Tom did snap her â
she was off like a shot, weaving away
after him, nimble, supple, light
footed for all her Hundred and seventy
pounds/ She was a fine figure, tall,
lithe, perfectly proportioned, and
strong , enough to hold her own with
half the men in the county. Tom ran
away from her . manfully, but in a
wink. she had him fast. He was half
a head lower than she â wherefore
she looked 'down >t him captive with
twinkling eyes. "You; all ain't playin*

smiling wickedly. "Over the river

simply couldn't. He was one of those
clean-built, hearty English chaps in
whom good breeding is a habit and
cordiality a second nature.
Even "My Lady" Hkqd him, though
she knew why he had come. Lancas
ter had been attracted by her picture
when he had seen it on the old man's
dressing taWe at some house party in
England. When he saw her in all her
girlish charm, he was determined tc
marry her.
The formal announcement was to be
made at the end of the Newport season.
Then the Ormondes Issued cards for a
dinner to celebrate their victory over
a woman's heart. It was to be a big
event, and I was among the very few
wot invited either to the dinner or the
ball to follow.
I met "My Lady" down on the rocks
the afternoon of the dinner.
We sat silent for a long time, . "My
Lady" and I, when who should coma
along the beach but his Lordship. "My
Lady" had been crying and Lancaster
was up in arms on the instant. He was
not a very quick thinker in some ways
and he got an idea that I was responsi
ble for the tears. That made me lose
my head, and before I knew what I
was doing I had let the whole truth out.
I didn't mince my words. They Just
came out in a torrent and I am afraid
that I was pretty plain spoken. I
shouldn't have blamed him if he had
knocked me down. Instead, he simply
stood there, his fine face growing as
gray as the mist that veiled the sea.
All of a sudden I realized what I bad
done and turned silent as suddenly as
I had commenced.
His Lordship made no answer to mm
but turned to "Aly Lady."
"Is it true, Miss Ormonde?" he asked
gently.
"My Lady" was crying harder than
ever now ; but she bowed her head. HÂ«
took her hand. "Believe me," he said,
"I had no idea. Tour father assured mÂ«
that there were no entanglements and
that you really loved me. It Is unfor
tunate that I should have fallen so
deeply in love with you before I dis
covered the truth, still. I do not know
that I am altogether sorry. It has
been a fool's paradise, perhaps, but it
is well to have loved one so.well worthy
of being loved.
"As for you," and he turned to me,
"I can only say that I like a game man
â and you were game. For the rest,**,
he shrugged his shoulders. "If yoa*

there is my yacht. If there are any

He walked down to the landing place
to see us off and give his orders to the
sailing master. He shook hands with
me, then turned and kissed "My Lady"
full on the lips. *
"God bless you." he said, "and make
you haDpy." Ther^he turned on his
heel and strode oft toward the house.

a resounding smack, then shoved him
forward, blushing furiously, to take
hands with Ellie. Ellie had laughed
with all the rest rejoicingly, though.
that her turn had come before this
innovation. . The rejoicing was, how
ever, premature. True to her word,
Polly snapped out Jack, and when he
had duly caught, kissed and passed
her on he called Ellie again to ths
floor. She shook her head and tried
to sit still, but there was such uproar
round about she got up and began ths
chase. It was a half-hearted pursuit
at first. Jack was evidently in llttls
danger. But when he rashly leaned
across the linked hands and blew a
kiss In her eyes she could do no less
than slip underneath and try to seiz*
him â but only in time- to see him
whisk to the other side. Then, enter
ing a little into the spirit of the cross
purposes she knew lay back of the
game, she began to chase in good
soothâ one that lasted five long min
utes and ended only when, breathless
and panting, she stopped still and
found her quarry run fairly into her
hands.
"Jack, I always knowed she'd run
ye down at last. Make her kiss, ye to
bind the bargain," Polly said joyously,
loosing one hand. Then, to her part
ner she added coyly: "I don't know
what's to become o* us two â unless wÂ»
can take each other sorter for con
solation."-
"Why â why â Miss Polly â I hadn't
never thought o* hit â but it might an
swer right down well," Tom said awk
wardly, yet trying to be gay and airy.
Jack stood facing Ellie with folded
hands and downcast eyes, the moral
and pattern of modest confusion, with
yet tell-tale quivers at the corners of
the mouth. After a second or two of
waiting he said plaintively: "Miss
Polly, Ellie don't play fair. What
shall I do about it?"
"I reckon you had better marry her
â jest try to." Polly retorted, and
Ellie, the high-strung, the coquettish,
after one glance into Jack's illumined
face, whispered very softly, "I reckon

effort is directed more toward an ex

Taylor what he was in the seventeenth
century than a review of the position
"which his writings hold in the world
of letters to-day. It Is more a biog
raphy of the theologian than of th
writer. Mr. Gosse finds a fertile fund
of thought In the analysis of Taylor's
mind and the moral philosophy which
emanated therefrom.
What Coleridge dwelt upon with a
somewhat morbid interest âTaylor's
very vigorous definition of future pun
ishmentâEdmund Gosse very discreet
ly disregards. Even though the uncom
promising theology of the old school

limned in the Pit with definite
boundaries, has softened Its severity
Fomewhat In these laxer days, the
biographer makes statement near the
close of his work of his purpose in
steering a wide course about these
hidden reefs of controversy.
From the standpoint of literature
alone Jeremy Taylor is the most In
teresting of all the old rhetoricians
whepe pulpits were wont to ring again
oith the thunders of their logic This
is bpraure of his remarkable depth and
the sincerity of his moral sensibility.
Life is singularly close to him; it seems
to thrill him through and through with
its manifold mysteries. To this mag

thought which for its scope and oft

For he is never man only with a defimte

Jeremy Taylor in some of his grandest
flights Is nothing else but the poet.
With true poetic insight he â  is ever
ready to clothe the thought In the
words which will best suit the harmony,
to seek out the (simplest and yet the

erouped according to their historical
!IochÂ« and songs of sentiment from
2SaSiWÂ».*oth of the old and latter
time. The same arrangement Is fol
lowed with Irish, Scotch and American
verse, until the latest worthy writings
of the class serve to close the volume.
To elucidate the archaic diction in some
of the older ballads and to supply a
necessary context of comment upon the
subjects of the poems and songs Â»-I
lected. the editors have devoted fifty
pages to glossary and notes.
In a foreword Professor Gayley has
something tcrsay about the value, here
tofore underestimated, of the study of
these ptÂ»ems of the people. He feels
that this golden treasury of rhyme,
from all ages of the history of our Eng
lish language is a part of our literary
inheritance no less than the more class
ical works of the great poets. They
should make an appeal, he rightly be
lieves, to the simple sense of the ro
mantic, the sentimental and the patri
otic that is in us all, for poetry of this
nature Is far more the poetry of th*
heart than is that highly polished liter
ature of the intellect which we call
classics. Such verse as that which the
editors have collected has a lesson of
pure esthetic pleasure which can be
more readily felt than that derived
from the higher forms.
For those who can remember with
sorrow the agony, once endured in
school days, of committing to memory
the then unintelligible "Thanatopsts"
or of "analyzing" bit by bit '"Tintern
Abbes'," Professor Gayley would carry
a soothing balm, for he believe*; that
this "gerund-grinding", of our master
pieces by youthful minds capable
of full understanding and appreciation
is an egregious sinâ as do all of us who
have passed through that fiery furnace
and Etillâ marvel that it Isâ have any
love . for good literature left In us.
Says Professor Gayley:
"If . this little book can contribute
somewhat toward exploding the fal
lacy that poetry is something other
than poetry â material, forsooth, for
translation, parsing, trope-hunting,
rhetorical exercises, platitudinous
preaching or anything else extraneous
to artâ it' will have" accomplished at
least half the purpose of the editors.
Of course good poetry has a Jessort for
him who can feel It. Like all good
things It cannot help blessing those
who take It on faith. The favorB are
not for those who ' conquer, but for
those who surrender. The best way to
study It is not to study but to enjoy."

JAPANESE
System of "Jiu-Jitsu."
ALMOST every cable is humming
with accounts of the startling
agility of the Japanese in their
struggle with Russia, Even those in
Europe who are not ardent sympathiz
ers with the little brown men are
forced to applaud the lightning strokes
of their strategy and the telling blows
which they have landed upon their
ponderous adversary even before^ he
has begun to pull himself together for
the fray. This is the Japanese "Jiu
jitsu" put into practice upon a grand
scale. This i3 the direct manifestation
of a system of bodily training more
perfect than was ever taught In Doric
schools, which has been used in Nippon
for more than 2500 years for the train
ing of her warriors. To read the recent
book upon "Jiu-jitsu" from the pen of
H. Irving Hancock is at the present
time to supply, oneself with a key to the
proper understanding of the Mikado's
campaigns up to date and to an appre
ciation of the spirit which moves Ja
pan's fighting men.
Mr. Hancock says that he undertook
the task of writing "Japanese Physical
Training" in order that he might dem
onstrate why it is that the diminutive
Japanese possess the greatest endur
ance of any people upon earth, and are
likewise the strongest and happiest
men and women in the world. Besides
revealing all of the intricacies of this
unusual system of bodily culture, the
author shows how It is that the dietary
standards, the free use of water and
love of fresh air affected by the Mika
do's subjects result In their almost
perfect physique and lightness of spirit.
Without the simple rules of right living
and proper dressing followed by the
Japanese the remarkable muscular de
velopment attendant upon assiduous
practice of "jiu-jitsu" cannot be ob
tained.
One has only to read the opening
chapters of Hancock's .book to dis
cover the cause for the rapid successes
which have come to the Japanese arms.
It seems that i "Jiu-jitsu" was discov
ered and practiced by the old Samurai
or warriors of the earliest Japanese
dynasties, who occupied a position
toward the common people somewhat
similar to that of the ancient Spartans
to the helots and were of a conse
quence forced to maintain their posi
tion by strength of arms.- From that
time "Jiu-jitsu" became more and more
popular until at the present time there
are schools of the art throughout the
whole of Japan, and it is made com
pulsory in both branches of the mill-

tary. The effects of it upon the Jap
anese army were shown In the ad
vance of the allies in China in 1900
when thev outmarched our own Amer
ican. troops by 50 per cent, and Russia
will doubtlt-Es witness such results
again and to her sorrow when serious
land operations are commenced.
ThÂ»; grand work of "Jiu-jitsu" is
based upon a proper diet and ; the prac
tice of a perfect hydropathy. The Jap
anese believe that we meat-eaters and
full Ilver3 work our stomachs altogeth
er too much. A handful of carefully
prepared rice, some fish,' a little salad
of greens and fruits, according to their
idea, are ample to support the body and
give the greatest play to anactivcand
healthy mind. This frugal diet, coupled
with constant draughts of pure wateV
and innumerable baths, serve to bring,
the beirlr.ner in "jiu-jitsu" up. to," the'
very pink of condition. Not only that,
but the author claims that such a sys
tem admits of no pulmonary or diges-
tive disorder* and that rheumatism is
known only to the very old.
The secret of the a'ctual practices of
"jiu-jitsu" Mes in the constant appli
cation of every muscle to a hardening
and tightening process, which permits
of the greatest expenditure of force
with the least tax of energy. Muscular
development is attained throuch en
tirely different means than those em
ployed in "Western gymnasiums. All
paraphernalia is dispensed with. By
the simple orocess of the struggle be
tween two contestants, modified in va
rious forms wherein hand, grips, leg
holds and falls are the only mediums
for development utilized, a "Jiu-jitsu"
Etudent weighing 129 pounds may learn
to worst an English or American ath
lete half again as heavy. He is quick
to cause the very efforts of his oppo-'
nent to reflect back upon their source
with redoubled vigor. Ho knows how
to paralyze his adversary by a blow
with the edge of the hand so that he
may become utterly helpless. A pinch
in the muscle, a cuick trip from be
hind and the heaviest man can be put
on his back In an Instant.
As war bulletins read now it looks
as If little Japan's Bcheme for the "per
fection of the body and the alertness
of the intellect is doing all that Han
cock claims for it. One reading his
book cannot but feel that he has made
out a good case for "jiu-jitsu," and
that it might be introduced into our
own country with profit to the race.

CORPORATIONS
Subject of Legal Tome.
VERY few additions to the science
of the'law have equaled either In
scope or Importance the remarka
bly exhaustive" work upon "Corpora
tions" which comes from the pen of
Judge Seyraore D. Thompson In the
form of volume 10 of the American Law
Book Company's Cyclopedia of Law
and Procedure. This comprehensive
study of a peculiarly knotty problem
of the law, the result of twenty years
of labor- on the part of the leading
legal author of the present dav, may
be said to be monumental both In Its
compass and in the authority which
the author's name imparts to it.
It is now about nine years since the
first volume of Judge Thompson's
"Commentaries on 'the Law of Corpo
rations" was given to the pubilc. By
that work the author, .whose fame was
already established in this country,
achieved International reputation. The
work has 'taken a high place in coun
tries where a knowledge of the lan
guage in which it is written is con
fined to the erudite. This work is now
out of print. On -this account, there
fore, the pu.blicatio ( n of the new treatise
by the same author, citing as it does
the recent cases, and tracing the later
development of the law, is a matter
which mu"st be of the greatest interest
to the profession, both here and abroad.
The spxse actually taken up by this
treatise covers 1363 pages and is equal
in. size to three ordinary volumes of
textbooks. The whole law of private
corporations having a" joint stock is

embraced, except that which properly
falls under the head of foreign corpo
rations and which will be treated un
der Its own title in a later volume by
the same author. â¢
Some idea of the exhaustlveness of
the treatment and of the carefulness
with Â»which the detail is . worked out
may_ be^ gathered' from the fact. that
the analysis covers 142 ' large octavo
pages. The writer has taken "whatever
space seemed to "be^ necessary : to the
full and clear statement of the law.
The note's are voluminous and include
everything useful-^ and" necessary by
why 'of explanation and '-Illustration.
The exammatlon^'or the
cited must; have Involved a tremendous
amount of -labor, since th'e, citation em
braces on a conservative estimate
about 25,000 decided cases. OwJrjS to
many recent cases In corporation litiga
tion especial interest attaches to Judge
Thompson's chapters upon "Consolida
tion or Amalgamation of Corporations,"
"Liability of Shareholders to Creditors
of Corporations." "Rights and Reme
dies of Shareholders." "Torts and
Crimes of Corporations" and "Actions
by and Against Corporations."
When the layman attempts a' review
of a work of this character, unlettered
in the law though he may be. he cannot
fail to note with wonder the remarkable
fund of knowledge' which has been
brought to bear upon its preparation.
Before such a heaping up of citations,
opinions of Judges and decrees of
courts the untutored mind shrinks and
turns back upon itself as if suddenly
brought face to* face with the revelation
of another world.

REVIEWS,
In Forri) More Brief.
WE all remember that delightful
member of the trio in "Throe
Men in a Boat" who greedily de
voured the pages of doctors' books un
til he was not certain whether he was
possessed of locomc-tor ataxia or house
maid's kneo. Any one reading "The
Aristocracy of Health." by, Dr. M. F.
Henderson (femme), will be in a far
worse plight than the third man in the
boat, for if ever the sins of frail man
kind were called up to torture craven
souls with their grisly shape3 this i3
that time. All of the Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union lectures of ail
tlnje rolled Into one cannot begin to ap
proximate the overwhelming condem
nation of human vices which, rolls Its
sonorous message from "The Aristo
cracy of Health." : .
â¢ "The human race is ill. The human
race is anaemic; and the world, which
Is a paradise, but by man converted
Into, a hospital,, is seen and. judged
through the eyes of the Invalid"â this;
the opening paragraph of Dr. Hender
son's book. To this cheering declara
tion Is added eftsoons, "Human life Is
but an apology, a makeshift, a com-'
promise. The decadent condition of
human life is such that some kind of a
poison habit Is supposed to be neces
sary In order to live presentably and
comfortably." "Wae's me that I should
read Dr. Mary Henderson's book and
still have a care to live," says the
trembling "drug-soaked wretch" who
hears all too late this* high clarion call
of the life beautiful.
The author prefaces her general sur
vey of the "poisons" to which human
frailty has fallen heir by defining
health. "Health," she would have it,
"Is more than mere consciousness of
the existence of one's body; it Is posi
tive pleasure in having 'a body." No
one will dispute the author upon the
profit and pleasure which comes from
the possession of those "raiments of
the bouI" which are ours, save possibly
the spiritualists. But it is when the
lady doctor launches - into the terrify
ing aspects of general unhealth that
the mlnd'of the average reader, stunned
and bewildered, follows haltingly..
TobasQO sauce, . candy, ruin, pepper,
'kerosene,' ammonia, 'tea, "old> # twist
chaw", and Vhginla plcu:ng8 t ijeer,
chloral, Wines, milk punches, yen shee
â thtHt: are poisons to which degener
ate humankind turns for sweet
nepenthe. These are the drugs which
v.ould kill a guinea pig in three
minute*, but v.hich only serve to bring
lingering decay and final sudden dis
solution to the' highest animal in the
scale. , -
"It is first to enjoy the pleasures
arising from irritation and then the
pleasures derived from ssml-paralysls
that the human race is willing to mort
gage itselfâ to enslave itself to a poi
son."
Scientific as all this may be it is
i:nfortunate that the subjects touched
upon in the first part of this book
have become so hackne.'ed from long
uee on the lecture platform and have,
as a consequence, become associated
to such an extent with corkscrew curls
and blue goggles that even a less
hysterical treatment of them than Dr-
Henderson's would not gain many
readers. Upon the subjects of diet, im
munity from contagion and the happi
ness which comes with a healthy body
and mind, the author has written more
rtstraincdly and, It would seem, to
better purpose.

"Her Infinite Variety," by Brand
Whitlc-ck, is the first novel of the year
to be brought out by the Bobbs-Merrill
Company. It might better be called a
novelette if that word were not of
somewhat doubtful worth, for the tale
itself is not long enough to be classed
as anything but a short story and
marginal decoratlcns and copious il
lustrations by Howard Chandler
Christy have to serve as very artistic
padding in order that the-book covers
may not be too near together.
Whitlack, who will be remembered as
the author of that strong story of po
litical life, "The Thirteenth District,"
has cast this story into a political mold,
the scene being laid in the legislative
halls of Illinois' capitol. A very hand
some and rather self-important young
State Senator who wishes to bring to
the eyes of his beloved a somewhat
loftier conception of the game of poli
tics vigorously espouses the cause of
woman's* suffrage at the Legislature.
A dashing young lady attorney who Is
pushing the cause succeeds in so en
tangling the Senator in her meshes that
he Is not certain whether It Is for the
cause of many women or one that he is
working. Finally he awakens from his
dream of enthusiasm to find that he has
all the society women of Chlcago.includ
lng his own fiancee, about his ears. By
the clever manipulation of one of these
matrons the young Senator's own lady
love is the. Innocent cause fcr the loss
of the suffrage bill, but she herself Is
satisfied that her f'enator means well
at least and everything is serene.
Whitlock has not written much of a
story in "Her Infinite Variety," for at
first- blush it cannot readily be seen
to which of the ladles in the book the
"Her" refers, nor wherein lies any
infinite variety in either. It would
seem that the story was modeled after
some of Paul Ford's shorter skits, say,
"Wanted, a Matchmaker." The borders
and Christy drawings serve to carry
out the idea, but the keen-edged clever
ness of the late Ford is lacking in this
book, . .

"The World Destroyer," a novel by
Horace Mann, is a peculiar tale. On*
reads it with gathering wonder and
not a little surprise that such a plot
;ould Bet into print and then at the
very last page the seeming Inanity of
the whole story is explained away by
a paragraph and the reader catches
himself making apology to the author
for the hard things he has thought
during earlier pages. 'The conception
of the story has the merit, of being
altogether unusual, but the author
makes the mistake of not giving the
hint of the story's. explanation earlier
than the last chapter, for it is a long
wade through the preceding ones and
some readers may not have that divine
endowment of patience. ' >

BREVITIES
About tbe Authors
FOLLOWERS of Izaak Walton will
welcome a book on Putnam's new
list, entitled "The Angler's Secret."
The author is Charles Bradford, who is
already known for his earlier volumes,
"The Wild Fiower" and "The Deter
mined Angler." The latter, work,
which was called by C rover Cleveland
"the most pleasant and practical and
sensible volume I have ever seen of Its
kind," was lUvoted to brook trout only.
This' new book, which is fully illus
trated, treats of the sporting species of
both fresh and salt water fishâ from the
tiny mountain trout to the mighty
striped bass of the ocean. It contains
r. full description of various tackles and
the methods of catching these fish, to
gether with notes of their habits and
habitats.
The latter part of the book considers,
rot so much the methods of actual
fish-killing as the glory of the chaseâ
the lovely scenery, purs air. the natural
exercise and the general exhilaration.
All these things are appreciated by the
true and chivalrous angler more than
the actual filling of the creel.
May it be taken for a good proof of
a gracious Providence watching over
literary persons that none of the three
men of letters who were shot at in
1003 wa3 even hurt? The lady who was
cruelly said to stand for the heroines of
"Lettres de Fcmmes"â a very arduous
pest-missed M. Marcel Prevost; Mr.
Kenneth Grahame's erratic assailant
suecumbed to the influence of the Bank
of England's water hose, and Dr. Max
Nordau, the fenrless champion of our
own poor country, was equally for
tunate in his escape. None the less,
this shootinz at literary persons is a
new and disquieting sign. In the case
of royalties, we have it on the au
thority of one of themselves that as
sassination is one of the perquisites of
the position. Perhaps literary persons
begin to pay the penalty of the popular
fame bestowed .by paragraphs and il
lustrated interviews.
Edgar Stanton Maclay, author of
"The History of the American Navy,"
is preparing a unique series for the
Baker & Taylor Company, which prom
ises to be of great popular. And histor
ical interest. The first volume of this
series will be "Moses Brown. Captain,
U, S. N." Not even Mr. Maclay, who
has written the most authoritative
and comprehensive history of the
United States navy, knew, of . Captain
Brown's two sensational victories over
British shins in the war of the Revo
lution. The record of these seems to
have been lest save In England, al
though Captain Brown has thousands
of. descendants who have radiated from
his Newburyport home. He was one
of the stern old privateer captains of
the Revolution, who afterward entered
the regular service, commanding the
Merrimac and conducting himself for
â¢many years with great valor. The gen
eral title of this series will be "Un
known Heroes of the Navy." and Mr.
Maclay promises enough of them to
startle the average student who feels
that he knows the history of the navy.
At least one of Frederick Palmer's
friends takes Issue with the "reviewers
who say that the idea of "The Vaga
bond" Is too romantic to have occurred
in real life. Certainly If any one knows
real life either at home, where the
scene of his novel is laid, or abroad. It
is Mr. Palmer himself, who, at 30, has
been in five wars, has encircled the
-world both by India and Siberia and
has roamed the length and breadth of
his own country as a correspondent.
He is now in Japan reporting a sixth
war. His method of working is to
write a month and then "loaf" a
month. It was by moving himself that
he kept hi3 hero moving so rapidly
through- the pages.

A correspondent of the Literary World
makes a rilea for the historical novel in
the February number. Amon~ other
well chosan arguments the writer says:

of historical novels are not always ex

of Navarre were conteinporarles. which
Is something to the good. It Is surely
better for the fiction-devouring 'young
person' to read of gallant knights than
gilded youths: the poorest of the his
torical novels are safer companions
than 'Wooed But Not Mated', or 'Broken

even lead to the reading of sober his
tory. Then, too, the historical novel
has In a measure rescued us from the
'problem novel* and the novel of char
acter dissection, which usually meant
the attributing of all actions to thÂ»
very meanest and lowest motives."
The identity of the author of "A Key
stone of Empire" and of "The Martyr
dom of an Empress" Is the subject of
many letters that reach the Harpers,
who publish these books. In accordant
with the author's wishes her publishers
must respect her anonymity. But the
question is frequently put to them. "Is
the author's authority on these subjects
genuine? Is she really a woman of
title, who has. known the royal person
ages of whom she writes?" To this
question the publishers are freÂ» to re
ply. The lady has personally known
the nobility of whom she writes, and
has an intimate knowledge based upon
actual experience of the Austrian and
other courts. Though now residing in
this country, she Is still in close touch
with some of the most eminent crowned
heads of Europe.
Among books relating to the present

Â«Jr% JT ISS SADIE MEEKER was a
f\/\ young woman who was inter
im Y I ested in the market value c-f
1 things; particularly in the
market value cf herself. As
k money changer at the desk in Major
&. Fairbanks her market value was
just $4 a. week: but a woman's real
market value, as Sadie well knew, is
nevrr what she can honestly earn, but
v hat the best man who wishes to
msrry her can earn, whether honestly
or not. Later ebe came to think seven
times out of ten of her husband and
the remaining three of her children;
but for the moment she whs conscious*
mainly that Margie Payne had married
a haluun-keeper, and Kittie Barwin a
part owner in a dance hall, and saloon
keepers and pnrt owners in dance halls
ate lords and landed gentry in the un
der world.
Marprie and Kittie had been Sadie's
next friends, and for some time after
their marriage she. too, would have
been contented to wed a saloon-keeper
or a part owner in a dance hall: but
after some hesitation she concluded to
become engaged to marry Charley Min
ick. Also his mustache curled beauti
fully.
Charley Minick in his twenty-eiphth
year had achieved a knowledge how
the world is made. He had joined the
â¢forco" with a resolution to be an
"honest copper," and his high aspira
tions still duns to -him, though they
had become modified. He would not
be so honest as to be unpleasant; he
would be just a little â oh! the veriest
trifle â better than his neighbors.
*'I don't set up for no saint," said
the magnanimous Minick. "but there
are places where I draw the line."
A Pitt or a Lincoln could have said
no more.
Margie's gifts from her lover had
been diamonds of price; Kittie's gifts
from, her lover had been diamonds of
even greater price; and Sadie was per
fectly aware of every woman's in
alienable right to possess better jewels
than any woman of her acquaintance
if she can induce a man to give them
to her. She explained her views to
Minick with vigor and point; she re
vealed to him the double jurisdiction
â¢under which he had agreed to live; he
must stand his trial ia the judgment of
her peers.
"Tou wouldn't have me ashamed be
fore Kit and Margie, would you?"
"The Pearl of Pie Alley couldn't
stand ashamed before Kit and Margie;
she hasn't got the shape! Eut I forgot;
it's a man that's proud of a woman's
fchape; the woman's only proud of what
she's got on It!" '.
"Even now they say I'm a fool to tie
up with you. They say there's no scale

and you've sot to go to the right place
to get it â I tell you those; I want to

"All right," laughed Minick, 'Til get

Three days after this conversation
â¢ tliere was a'Erreat social "event" at
the town house of Edward Sandys of
Sandys & Mcrton, who served God and
mankind to the amount of some mil
iiors per annum. They performed their
cervice largely by accepting a controll
ing interest in undertakings to which
the name oL Sandys &. Merton lent a
commercial value. The great social
â¢event," with its great display of plate
and jewels, was followed by a gTeat
Â« racktman's "event." Before the awak

That afternoon an ornate reporters'
column in one of the public prints con
sisted of an interview with the "subtle
and competent Detective Minick."
Charley was alleged to be "working"
oit the Sandys case.
' One morning while matters were at
this pass the chief handed Minick a tel
egram which was dated Akron, Ohio.
It signified that one Bud Denmer, age
â¢SC, height 5 feet ll'i, complexion dark,
eyes blue hazel, hair prematurely gray
and black, beard solid black, teeth good,
nose large and pugnacious, weight 165
pounds, was "wanted," and was sup
posed to be in New York. .The rewaid
was 5500 and the particulars would fol

Richard Cober was fast becoming the
head of a profession of which he was
proud, but which he disliked to hear
called by its right name. He was only
from time to time actively engaged in
it, and it took him for the most part
out of town into the beyond. He was
understood by his children and nom
inally by his wife, to be a "traveling**
man. His absences would last for a
few days or a few weeks, and out of
the beyond he would commonly bring
back a great deal of monsy or a very
bad temper. Once his absence lasted
nearly three years, and he brought
back only a new suit of clothes, a pallid
face and a most unpleasant trick of
the eyes.
When Richard Cober was in luck he
was lavish with his "kids," and at
times liked nothing. better than to have
them tumbling over him; and whether
or not he was in luck, there was noth
ing their mamma could want that he
did not find a way to provide. For the
most part he looked uncommonly sharp
and hard: . but in his daintily uphol
stered flat In Clinton place he was at
least adored. He sang songs and cut
a double-chuflle for the kids and played
at blind man's buff; and Mrs. Cober
possessed jewels that would have made
Sadie Meeker's frosty eyes burn with*
desire.
One afternoon while Bessie was
dandling a doll half as big as herself
and Richard and Bobbie were doing
a cake walk with an energy and free
dom of grimace and gesture that made
her scream â  with laughter the door
opened and a gentleman, who had
held a little colloquy with the maid in
the hall, entered unannounced. The
gentleman was Detective Minick. ,
"Eighteen-carat place you got- here,
Buck, old sport; pie-anna, French
clock, Turkey rugs, nice kids; things
been spin' your way."
"Don't look as if you'd been up
against hard luck yourself. Skip,
kids. Mr. Minick and me will be
wanting to bill and coo in private."
"Somethin' doin'?" he asked with
laconic elegance.
"A little matter o' my own. I want
you to out me next."
"What the blazes do you come to
me about 'next' for? I ain't next to
nothin' in this town except you dead
ones at the front office."
"Read the papers lately?"
"One o' you fly cops croaked an'
you want to touch me for a bouquet
for the stiff?"
"Seen the details o' that Sandys
job?"
"Oh, it's that, is it? You can search
me. You'll have to guess again if you
want to pick a winner. I ain't mixed
up in that. I haven't done any work
in this town for five years; I live here
an' you know well enough that where
I live there's nothin' doin'. I've got
too much at stake."
"Don't suppose I'd be sittin* here
rubberln' at your, wallpaper if you
done it. do you? But I want you to
set mixed up in it. There's five thou
sand semoleons reward, an* I need 'em
in my business." Â¥ &%'â¢â (*.
"Who told you I was interested in
your business? I got troubles of my
own. It won't do, Charley; I give
it to you straight. I didn't do the job
myself and don't know who did; but if
I did know I wouldn't tell you. I
ain't grot, nothing against you person
ally; you always treated me square,
an' I'd go as far for you as an
other man; but I never yet beefed on
a pal an' I'm not groin' to begin. I'm
a bad lot, if you like, but I wouldn't
turn mouthpiece for the whole five
thousand."
"Better wait till I offer "em," said
Minick intently; "what'll you do for
this?" .
Minick passed him with one hand a
telegTam fr6m Akron. Ohio, and with
the other fingered a revolver in " his
coat pocket. Minick's acquaintances

"Swell place you got here. Buck;

to' shift." . - â 
Minick was to be congratulated on
the completeness with which he., had
thought out his case. , . i
"I don't want to be hard on you,
Buck; I'll give you time all right to
turn the thing over in your mind; but
understand me, I want those semo
leons. If you should happen to dis
cover a way of helpin' me get them,

"Dick, you've, said .time after 'time
that if it ever came to a pass again
where you had to choose between me
and the kids and a gun you'd let the
gun go; and you're up against that
choice now," urged' Mrs. Richard
Cober when Minick , had said ','so
long" and taken his leave. -"You've
got enough money saved up to quit the
business anyhow.- I've often told, you
that with what we have in the bank
we could go over to liondon, bringiup
the kids respectably and live decently
ourselves." ,'..
"A man like me's no business with
kids, Nell, old gal; nor with a woman
either," said Cober wearily, not for the
first time in his life "up against" the
eternal difference between a woman's
world and a man's. " / â¢' ' '
That evening, after. his pacific inter

to say he loved his own skin^too Intel-,
ligently to put direct questions . about

been the least reason why he should
ask Questions.
He had â  fully . mastered his ideas Â« In
this connection when â  he entered, "The
Green Dragon" and the presiding Belial
stepped forward ..and handed him a
note." It consisted. of but two lines and
a signatureâ he had received the pre
cise duplicate of It just as hÂ© was leav
ing Clinton -place. . "I want, to see you
In a hurry, Buck. Pull the ringer at
the number given In the other note. â
L. C." Half an hour afterward he. was
sitting at the bedside of Lubin Cav
anaugh, in a house on Sixteenth street.
When in obedience to a weak-voiced
summons to "Come in" . Richard first
entered the room, he perceived an
emaciated head , fallen back In an
ecstasy of exhaustion among, the pil
lows; when the emaciated head had
Identified its visitor as "Buck" Cober,
It hailed him '.with "Hello.,, old sport!"
and the man to whom it belonged sat
upright,- threw back the bedclothes and
resumed an interrupted labor, which
was the .labor, of "setting," or possibly,
as Richard Judged, of resetting, jewels.
"Thought you might be the*" doctor
with some more dope. * He .an' I are
doin' a little song an* dance together
while I fix up this pennyweight, job.
I'm playin' the pennyweight *grame
alone, an' he might want to cut in.
He'd speculate on these sparklers In
his bill if he knew I had 'emâ beutes,
ain't they?"
The time had been when a "spark
ler" had the same fascination for
Richard Cober that it had for Lubin
Cavanaugh, but he was in no mood
that evening to admire another man's
plunder. A wonder as to the previous
ownership of the jewels he could not
repressâeven fn the r'Stir" men make
guesses as to .the origin of an un
scheduled piece of bread â Jjut the eti
quette of the under world forbids in
quiry in regard to such matters.
"What you so blue about, Buck?

havin' a row, have, you ?'* r: v- .. â¢'
"No. It's jus' a, general- case o'
grouch. I get hipped ev'ry now an'
then jus* as I used to. What can 1
do for you, Lubin? I got to shift in
a few minutes."
The two looked at each other for an
instant In that quick but piercing way
which all guns, let alone tfals, have.
"I'd 'a' let you into the job. Buck, but
it was Jus* the kind o.' game to attract
an old single-handed stiff like myself,
an' I played it alone. What I want is
a 'dopp' just like this one without the
break," and, ha handed Cober a little
instrument newly broken. "I've got to
have a new one' by 11 o'clock to-morrow
morning, an* I'll be dead" obliged to yoti
if, you'll get it for me. I'd get it my
self, ; hut I got . these symptoms, you

"That's all right, Lube. 'Tain't as

"Well, take care o' yourself, old man,
an' if you see any o* the push, tell 'em
I'm baskin' in the-sun down among the
Mexies. So longr. Buck."
"Well?" said Mrs. Cober expectantly
when Richard paused at the close of his
account of the evening's interview with
Cavanaugh.
"Well! It's cuffs in Clinton place.
Jail in Akron^ free rides between pints,
free grub an' lodgin' every where. I
can't 'beef on a pal like Cavanaugrh.
Nell.-. A man's got to stick by his
friends."
"It ain't a case o* beefin' on a pal,
Dick;' it's a case o* doin' dirt by me an*
the kids. There ain't one o' your friends
has stood by you like me an' 'the kids;
it you got to stick by your friends,
you' got to stick by us." .
;"It won't do, Nell; a gun's seen his

be square with you, an* it'll be the bet
ter for you in the end. I don't even
know for sure that Cavanau.^h made
the touch: but whether he did or not.
he'd know I had split on him, an' he'd
follow me till he croaked."
"A woman is perfectly helpless when
she's. tied to a man that means to play
the fool," she said bitterly. "You have
to be "square to the push or the push
will set even with you; you can do as
you like, by the woman an* the kids'.
No matter what you do, they've got to
stand for it."
This statement being: self-evldsnt,
Richard Cober made no reply to it; he
went to- bed. Half an hdur later Mrs.
Cober put on' her hat and shawl and
softly left the house; that perhaps was
a part of her idea.
The raid was one of those ordinary
man hunts; with. the game at bay. the
details of which even the newspapers
have long since wearied of reporting.
The "flatties" in uniforms surrounded
the place, and Minick with three fel
low huntsmen went into the building to
face an animal rather more dangerous
than one of the larger carnlvora.- The
animal, however, was intelligent. Cava
naugh'had not the : slightest. chance of
escape, and knew it the minute his door
was open and the detectives drew their
revolvers. "They're good," he remarked
in the gambler's Jargon, and allowed
himself to be handcuffed. His only
comment on the capture lay in the
words: "Another case of beef."
The Sandys jewels were all found in
Cavanaugh's possession, a number of
them very skillfully reset and two of
the larger very skillfully disfigured.
The public prints ran? the next d*y
with the praise of the celebrated Min
ick, and repeated their version of the
unrecogniz/d intellectual profession,
which taxes the swiftest and subtlest
powers of the mind and., to which soci
ety owes its immunity from crime.
Sadie Meeker drew the attention of
both Margie acd Kittie to the mos*.
highly ornate paragraphs In praise o!
the celebrated Minick- and enjoyed the
proud delight of fame. She had been in
some doubt until the newspapers took
him up whether, she cared for him
"really," but the reporters' eloquence
decided her. When the ring waj
brought a great flush of triumph came
info her faceâ the diamond was bigger
than Kittie's and prettier.
"Oh, Charley, there is scale in your
job." she exclaimed, "and I will marry
youâ for your mustache!"
The "box" was as satisfactory as the
stone, and a receipted bill from Tif
fany's was even more satisfactory than
the box; but there were a number of
Items of which Tiffany took no account.
The week that the marriage of De
tective Minick was announced an inci
dent occurred in one of the side streets
of the City of Mexico. At the city hos
pital, where an injured man was* taken,
certain papers and checks found in his
pockets showed that he conducted his
financial affairs at least over the name
of Oliver Ilewes, but the police were
much puzz!ed to find tattooed in blue
ink on the left forearm the name
"Buck Cober." He never regained con
sciousness and it was impossible to ob
tain any statement frcm him. The
wound in his head seemed to indicate
that he had been hit with, an uncom
monly heavy billy. A woman came
forward frcm nowhere in particular to
claim the body, but she showed no dis
position to supply, biographical details;
she dedicated her energy to hysterics.
It has perhaps no connection with
this Incident that two weeks previously
the following paragraph appeared In
various newspapers in the United
States: . "Lubin Cavanaugh. alias New
York Lube, escaped from prison
last night. He was a notorious profes
sional burglar and ha3 a record against
him which takes up several pages oi
the prison's blotter. A reward of
$500 Is offered for his capture and Im
prisonment until the prison authorities
can be communicated with."
There are those who rate themselves
"wise." however, who believe that the
two trivial incidents are connected and
that a belated item should be added to
the bill from Tiffany's.no_text10
HOW TO TRIM THE FASTER HAT
* r Is no*, the hat as mucn as the
i trimming."
Tlie speiker. a fashionable mil
"* liner, held off a hat at arm's
length to be admired. Its mate

â¢vs almost obscured beneath a shir
i :;\t of silk intislin. The under part
â¢ i! t!:-> brim v,-a? entirely covered with
tl.-ls shirrlnc. which was bordered
v ith late. The edjre of the brim was
bound In velvet. O:ie side turned up
and there was .; jiaua of shirring: on
lop Bnlsbjed with u stiff brush of
feathers *'- one tsidel
The- bwkle feature is one that can
he observed upon -hats and gowns.
Baclde* will be used in a variety of
v.jys. .
'*Gire in? 1 thief* long buckles," said
a tnlilinsr; "and I will complete your
Â« ostume for you. One of these buck

your aralst. The second I will run
through your ptock. And the third
one 1 will i.lace in the front of your
bit, ronttjns a velvet ribbon through
it, jun as though it were for the belt!"
Speaking these words, wiCTI a few
deft twirls of her talented fingers she
ran the ribbon through the buckles,
and i;ooii had them adjusted at belt, at
yoke and upon the hat. It was done
very Quickly and required no special
skill beyond the ability to puff the
ribbon. When in place the buckles
quite transformed the costume. But
most of all did the hat benefit, for a
buckle makfs a very effective and
complete trimming; often setting off
the other trimmings and giving a cer
tain elegance to the surroundings.
Lady Curzon's new hats are quit?
the talk of both continents. It 'is
whispered that they* originated in a
I'aris millinery establishment, and
that her ladyship herself designed
them, but using the beautiful mate
rials from the Far East.
Tlic Hats of Lady Curzon.
One of these hats is a great black
picture hat faced with crimson panne.
The bolder of the hat is black. Upon
the top there are two plumes fully as
long as your arm. and these lie across
the hat from side to side and trail
down over one ear. The crown of the
hat is not visible from the front. It
is covered with a very beautiful kind of
Indian embroidery, in which there are
scattered some mock Jewels and a few
precious ones.
Another hat is built of white satin
straw with a square crown and a wide
brim. The brim is bound with shell
pink satin. And.' all around the
Â«-rot\ n, there lie pink orchids in a great
chain, with the green leaves of the ivy
coming up through the orchids.
And still another hat, this one an all
black hat, is built on the spreading or
der. The crown is tall and square, the
brim is wide and dropping at one side.
whiJe It turr.s up at the other. And
over the top there lies a great plume
very long and very heavy. The brim is
faced with maline.
When Queen Alexandra sent to Lady
Curzon for a design for a gown to
v.ear to the coronation ball the Vice
reine of India sent material for a robe
which was so elegant that it is still re
membered by those who beheld it.
Since that time designs have traveled
regularly from India to; England, and
one of the latest and prettiest is a de-
Fign for a racing hat which will do
tloubt be made up and worn to the
<Jrand Prix.
The color of the' Queen's hat is gray,
the Queen's favorite color. The shade
is the biicht thoarh sort gray, the color
which one associates with Irish poplin.
The hat is round, suggesting a. native
Indian shape, and the brim turns up in
a great sweep all around, something
like the sides of a dishpan. The crown,
whica is invisible except from a top
view, is trimmed with a band of silk.
The brim is almost covered with a
shirring of gray satin ribbon put on In
tiny patterns. Black velvet is threaded
through the crown. And at one side
there are three stiff plumes or quills of
gray. This hat, which is pretty enough
for a queen to wear, is not at all
dressy, and yet is quietly elegant. It
could be worn with a calling gown or it
might be worn with a reception cos
tume.
The Xew French Hals.
All milliners agree that, while the
shapes of hats are changed materially,
it is not so much the shape as. the
trimming-that ia new. There are cer
tain touches which give the hats their
chic and- which are absolutely essen
tial to the style of the hat.
French milliners are trying to revive
blue, for the day of the blue hat was
practically out. â¢ Few women wear the
all blue hat, except with - an all blue
gown, or unless blue happens to be
strikingly becoming. Yet blue is the
French color and one 'can look for
turquoise and- bluette in the new
French hats.
. The English, on the other hand, are
trying to introduce brown; and a great
many of the English hatters insist that
the brown hat will be the hat of next
spring. The tourist hats, made by the
English hatters, show many shades of
tan and brown; and there are browns
ranging all the way from the soft
brown, which Is sometimes called but
ter brown, down to the deep. seal.
Golden brown is, perhaps, the fa
vorite and the riding derbies, the Al
pine hats and the soft outing sailors
and slouch hats for women will be
built of brown straw and brown felt.
The American milliners " differ, in
their Ideas, not a little from the
French and from the English. They
are true to their old loves, and, at the
beginning of each season, they- come
out with gorgeous hats in geranium, in
poppy color, in brilliant scarlet chiffon
and in ribbon hats, â  showing a multi
tude of bright rediroses.
And there is an -.argument in favor
of red in the springtime. It is cheer
ful; it affords that contrast which is so
necessary after the somberness of win
ter; it has the approval of the best
milliners and it is becoming to nearly
every women. The new -red hats are
positively brilliant^in their aspect, for
they are red from: tip to tip, without
one particle of color to relieve them.
In selecting the all red hat one must
be sure to look for the touch of black.
This is a little irlck that is known to
every milliner, though not to every
amateur. Unless a gay hat has its
touch of black there is little hope for
it, and a scarlet hat without its 'touch
of black will be flat and unbecoming.
But relieve it with black and you will
at once make it chic".* .-â â -
"Give me at least a yard of narrow
black velvet ribbon," said a French mil
liner, "or I cannot hope to make a
hat." And her beautiful /showcases
bore evidence' of the wisdom of her
taste. Lovely hats, with their flat
brims spread with geraniums, were dot
ted with little bows of black velvet
ribbon. And hats of orchids, which
are to be fashionable this' Reason, also
had black velvet ribbon in their back
ground.
And, when speaking of the floral hat,
do not forget the 'Violet hat. which,
in this country, is â¢â¢â  one . of i the most
fashionable hats of th j spring. Each

year the violet hat comes in and each
season it is a little more in favor than
the last. ' â  ' ... :
An .excuisite violet hat is made of
black straw, with a : trimming of ma
line. The under side of the brim is
shirred with maline. The aide of the
hat is trimmed with one great bunch
of violets, almost as ' large as '.a peck
measure,- and -with green leaves com
ing out through the violets. The vio
lets are tied with a purple ribbon and
the whole is fastened at the side of
the hat to make a showy trimming.
Flowers are always in evidence, in
the spring, and the milliners give abun
dant evidence that they are delighted
to exchange the trimmings of winter,
which are necessarily ; heavy, for the
flowers of spring.-
By the student of that part of the
feminine dress known as the' hatÂ« there
is a lesson to be learned, a lesson-that
It would profit every woman , to take
unto herself. This lesson is nothing
more than a chapter on the adaptabili
ty of the properly selected hat.
There is a very fashionable woman
In New York who for years > has made
it her practice to purchase no hat that
could not be worn- all the year, round.
Just now she buys the great black pic-
ture hat, covered with shirred chiffon,
shirred muslin or tucked maline." Or
she would invest in one of the new Jet
ted toques, which are as smart as they
can be.
Hats for All the , Year. /
The wary-woman/ when she buys a
hat, will ask, "Is this a hat that I can
wear all the year round?" At the end
of^ her first season the wisdom of this
policy will begin to be apparent to her,
and at the end of a year she will begin
to reap abundant rewards. She will
have always at hand . at a change of
season a hat # that, by a little remodel
ing, can be worn another year.
The new Jetted hats now show 1 evi
dence of progress. They are Jetted, not
with little spangles, but with long
hanging drops which dangle'-and flash
very prettily. These are sewed into
lace or into some soft substance, or the
hat is "covered, with silk which is cov
ered with the little dangling drops.
A great many of the hats willhave
dangling ends. Hats that are bordered
â¢with fringe will not be uncommon. To
border a hat with fringe is a simple
matter. Apply the fringe to the brim
of the hat so that it falls over the face
and hair, and that is all there is to it.
But it should be a' very handsome
fringe, very lustrous, and It should not
be v too deep. /The soft chenille fringes
and those that are elaborately Jetted
are much used.
A great many hats' will have the lace
borders, coming down so as to make a
scarf which falls, over the brim. Last
season not a few of the hats had a bor
der of fine insertion, which was applied
precisely as though it were lace This
is good upon a hat of midsummer.

BROWNIE
AND THE
BOLO
BY ROBERTUS LOVE.
X-<Y r. LOUIS. Feb. 24.â Perhaps the
\O\ most novel eight to be seen in
Y) America these midwinter days is
Â»^ that cf the native Filipino car
penters hard at work in building
their city at the World's Fair at St.
Louis. The word carpenter suggests
hatchet end saw, auger and plane.
The Filipino carpenter uses none of
these tools. With only his bolo â which
some persons facetiously term a corn
knife â he constructs complete houses,
roofs, walls, floors, partitions and all!
Yes. there is one other tool that he uses
occasionally, and that is a small ham
mer with which to push home his hand
ina.de bamboo nails. ;â¢ .-
It is interesting to watch the half
Vjndred Filipinos (now at the World's
fair grounds doing their part of the
work of constructing the scores of
buildings that will house the Filipino
exhibit, including the 1500 Filipino na
tives who are to be brought over for
the exposition period. A number of the
houses are being built entirely by the
Filipincs, while for others they furnish
only the roof of nipa leaves and bam
boo lattice work. The Filipino build
ings, covering a tract of forty acres,
are more than three-fourths completed.
Months ago many carloads of bam
boo and nipa from the Philippine
lr lands were delivered on the ground.
Then the brownie got out his bojo and
set to work. It was merely necessary
i'or him to yann his bolo from its sheath
or scabbard, which he wears belted to
his waist as an American army offi
cer wears his sword. A Filipino with
out this bolo scabbard at his waist
would feel like a Missouri River cat
fish in the Sahara Desert. This short,
thick, sharp knife is his constant com
panion. Its blade is about ten Inches
long and has two edges. Sometimes
the hilt is handsomely carved, for the
Filipino takes as much pride in his bolo
as does the Mexican in his sombrero.
The bolo is the Filipino's badge of
citizenship. <" â "'.â - ij
Long trunks of bamboo trees He In

poles, jointed here and there â¢ some
thick enough to make 'stout supports.'
others so thin that they are easily pli
able and can â  be bent and ' tied â  Into
Our. Filipino carpenter squats him
self upon the ground, with a padded
plank under him these chilly days. He
selects from the pile a bamboo pole
and gets to work with his bolo. Dili
gently he scrapes and shaves, turn
ing out curling shavings that in his
own land he would use for the mak
ing of mattresses. With tedious care
he continues scraping and shaving with
his sharp knife until the bamboo is re
duced to a strip which bends double
under its own weight when lifted . by
one end or the middle. â¢ Thus treated,
the strip is used for weaving In' the
basic plan of the roof. A lattice of
these strips is laid on the unshaven
bamboo poles as supports, the poles
themselves J being fastened to the sills
and comb by strings made of a na-

tive grass or rattan cord. As a mat
ter of fact, these poles are sewed down,
the needle being made out of a piece
of bamboo. In some instances the bam
boo "nail" is used, being driven', into a
hole cut in the bamboo pole.
The lattice work completed.., then
comes the nipa. .The Filipino puts on
layer after layer of these broad, 1 tough
leaves, similar to the palm from which
fans are made. With his hand-made
needle and his natural . threadâsome
times it also ,s hand made, being
bhaved down from , bamboo ..stripsâ he
sews the thick thatch securely together.

the most approved manner of the Fili
pino carpenter. It . Is i rather \ slow
work, â¢ but â¢ it . is sure. The na-
tive 'â â  stands on ecaffolding . made
entirely of bamboo, tied with bamboo
strings. If he happens to- tear his
trousers he patches 'the garment with
his bamboo needle and bamboo thread.
Nature is kind to the Filipino. What
more could any man ask than his 1 house
building material, his furniture stock
and his clothes repairing apparatus
right at his elbow?
During the snow blizzard in latter
"January the Filipinos &\ the world's
fair kept Indoors most of the time.
Some of them werevery much alarmed
because the snow continued' to fall. for
â¢ nearly .two days. ; They, were afraid
that, they would be snowed in so that
communication" with the city and nec
essary supplies would, be cut off. But
as the islanders never saw any sno\y
until they came to St. Louis their fears
can be forgiven them.
One of the- large buildings already
completed on. the Filipino tract is the
grand restaurant.^ In front of "this
building a Filipino band of forty pieces
will play during the fair. ,The roof is
"of bamboo and nipa. The Interior finish
is in â  native Filipino woods, some of
* them of extreme hardness and splendid
gloss. ' , â¢
The "Intramuros," or walled oity of
old Manila, .accurately reproduced, -is
also completed. Visitors entering the
Filipino reservation from the main part
of the exposition will cross a heavy,
solid-looking bridge that spans the
Laguna de Bay. This Is reproduced
from the celebrated Puente de Espana,
crossing the Pasig .River al Manila,
The substantial masonry is excellently
counterfeited in staff and wood.
There are two other bridges across
the Laguna de Bay, built of bamboo.
In the waters near by are little huts
made entirely of native materials,
thatched with nlpa grass, both roof
and aid* walls. In the trees not far
away are queer-looking houses, where
the tree-dwelling Filipino will have his
habitat.
The walled city is 250x350 feet in di
mension. The agriculture building, in

GIRL FROM
THE EAST
By Marjorie A. BarRlcy
(Copyright, 1904, by T. C. McClure.)
THERE was excitement among the
young officers at Fort Wayne
when .Hicks, the little corporal
who were his cap on- the side of.;
\ his head, spread the report that
the girl from the East had come and
hadxbeen escorted to Colonel Klein's
house.
During that first day there was an
unusual amount .of promenading in
Officers' Row. Lieutenants, sergeants
and even corporals found time to walk,
in approved military style, past the
colonel's quarters, and there was one
who showed signs neither of excitement
nor Interest. It was Captain Roberts.
He told his. friend, a first lieutenant,
that he wouldn't go around the corner
to see twenty girls; whereat the lieu
tenant grunted j and said something
about behavior in the Philippines, add
ing with frank sarcasm, "You're a
peach, you are, to pose as a woman
hater after, cutting me out with the lit
tle senorita so clean that every fellow
in the regiment was afraid to have you
see his girl. I know you all right, old
pal, and I'll bet with the rest that you
take your little stroll in the row on the
heels, of some big-headed corporal. I
passed the house, myself." he owned
boldly, "and I saw her. too. She's a
regular beaut, Dick."
But even his besl friend failed to
awaken the interest of the captain. .He
went so far as to get into citizen's
clothes that same afternoon and leave
the fort for a walk in the river road.
This, by the critical corporals, was con
sidered stuck up.
When the captain reached a sandy
strip of beach a mile or more from the
fort he stretched out at full length and
gazed at the water where freight and
passenger steamers passed on their
routes to the Great Lakes.
His thoughts, whether they were on
commerce or navigation, were profound
indeed, for he started when he heard
the rush of a woman's skirts and saw
from the corner of his eye that a girl
was approaching. *â  He moved a little,
but did not look in her direction until
the girl stopped and said softly, "I beg
your pardon, but isn't thisâ it is! Dick,
I knew It was you!"
Captain Roberts sprang to his feet
and looked into the girl's flushed face.
"It's Margaret, Dick," she said.
"Peggy."
Roberts took the hand sh* offered.
"Peggy." he said wonderingly. "Peggy,
you take my breath away. Where did
you come from?"
"I'm staying at Colonel Klein's, but
where did you come from?"
"You at the fort?" he asked Incredu
lously. "That's where I live. Sit down
here on this rock. Peggy. Peggy
Adams, do you realize how you have
surprised me? When did you strike
these parts?"
"This morning."
"No! Then you're the girl from tha
East? They've been talking about you
for weeks.
â¢How lovely of themâ and you?"
"Why, I'm up there, too."
"Those clothes?" she said doubtfully.
"Are 'cits,' " he finished smiling. "I
wear a uniform up there."
"Oh! And what are youâ what
rank?"
"Captain," he said briefly. "Peggy,
how you have grown up."
"Have I?" she laughed. "And so have
you, about two feet higher; and you
went to West Point after all?"
"Yes, father insisted."
"Do you like the army?"
"Oh, yes, when we see active service."
"Then you have seen active service.
In the Spanish-American war? Oh, tell
me about it."
Roberts laughed. "I will some time."
he said. "I will tell you anything you
ask, but let's talk about you now.
Where have you been all these years?"
"School and collegeâ and around at
places." â _[:.'
"That means traveling, I suppose, yet
you never visited West Point?"
"Never. I didn't know that you were
there, that you had gone back. You
know you said â "
"Yes. I said several things about that
time. You haven't forgotten then?"
"Forgotten? Oh. Dick, I couldn't for
get. Never. Wasn't it dreadful?"
"It was rather a bad mess, but weâ
at' least I â showed remarkably good
taste, though you weren't as beautiful
then as you are now."
"I can't snub you for that," the girl
said with carefully lowered lashes. "It
sounds genuine. You always were thor
oughly genuine, Dick."
" "Yes, I was in earnest then." he said
smiling. "You " were my first sweet
heart." He laughed, aloud. "My, how
you cried when the minister refused to
marry us. I flattered myself that you
were disappointed; but it really was
your pride, you poor little girl."
He regarded the poor little girl's
blushing face with tender affection. \
"I ' think that the old minister was
the sweetest man I ever met. He knew
that we were eloping. How gentle he
was and tactful. I have always thought
of him with thankfulness akin to love."
"I thought - he was a regular old
donkey, but It appears that I am the
only one who was In real earnest," he
said tentatively.
Peggy laughed. "Do you remember
"my high-heeled boots?" she asked, ig
.norlng his; remark.
"Oh! don't I, though. You tripped
and I had the delirious joy of catching
you In my arms. But do you remember
how I saved money? I've roared over
my willness more than once. You know
I had only $25 to my name, and I said
that carriages were too slow and that
we would much better take a car."
"I had forgotten that," Peggy said.
"but I remember how fighting mad you
were when papa rushed in. You stood
between him and me and said, 'Sir,
your daughter has consented to becoma
my wife?' Oh, Dick, wasn't It funny?"
"Yes." he said slowly. "Sometimes It
seems funny to me and sometimes it
seems strangely tragic. That wa were
such babies is the only saving fact.
Poor kids." He sighed and turned his
eyes from the girl's face. "I suppose
you're engaged now?" he said.
"No."
"How does that happen?"
She shook her head. "And you?* aha
said.
"Engaged? No, Indeed. I never taw
but one lovable girl In my life."
"And she wouldn't marry you?"
"She wouldn't. There will never ba
another. I lost track of her."
"But you didn't forget her?" thÂ» girl
asked softly.
"I never forgot her for a minute. But
It's too late to find her now. She does
n't care for me anyway."
"Oh, Dick, don't say that. Any girl
ought to care for you. Just tha fact
that you stay true to one woman
should be enough. Don't giva up and
spoil it."
"Will you give me a recommenda*
tion?" he asked smiling. "Say that
none of my relatives wera hanged, 05
something like that?"
"I could say much better things. II
is beautiful that you want to find hsr.
I like it, Dick. And I think the) girl
will like It."
Roberts looked deep into her eyesÂ«
but he saw no self-consciousness. Ha
forgot what he had read many times,
that women are clever actresses.
"Your advice may be good," ha said
after a few moments of silence, "bu8i
what would you hava said yourself,
Peggy, If I had hunted you up and had
told you about caring for you? ThÂ«
girl is very much like you. What
would you have said?"
"Oh. that's silly. Dick." she â aid
quickly. "You know you wouldn't**'
She looked past Roberts and frowntd
uneasily. "It's going to rain," she mur*Â«
mured, "and I'm cold." - Â»
"Oh. I suppose so," Dick said gloom
ily. "She'd say that, too. That's why I
didn't hunt her up."
"But It's going to rain. There I felt
a drop, Dick."
Roberts rose quickly and looked to*
ward the fort. .
"By jove, it Is. Peggy. I didn't notica
those clouds. Here comes the -wind.
We'll have to stand under those tjÂ£es
till it blows over. I'm mighty sttrry
that I didn't notice It." He slipped off
his coat and wrapped It about the girl's
shoulders.
"Oh, don't, Dick." she protested.
"Please. You know girls don't tak*
cold as easily as men. They're used to
exposure." "-'
They ran to a clump of trees and
Roberts made the girl kneel by a low
stone wall that ran At the side of tha
road. * * :
"Dick, I don't want you to stand
there in the rain. Please- take your
coat."
He smiled down at her. "What a
foolish little girl it Is." he said. "But
I'll kneel beside you if you think lt'3
safe."
She raised her questioning eyes to his.
"I wish you would," she said. "I don't
like to have you take such a terrible
risk, and just to protect me when I
can keep dry In this corner as well as
not."
Roberts dropped to his knees and
leaned against the wall.
"Peggy," he said, " 'just to . protect
you' I would give my life. Didn't yc/u
know that, dear?" There was tender
ness in his tone, and conviction. Ha
spoke not passionately, but truly.
Peggy locked her hands tightly to
gether and her lips quivered. It seemed
a long time before she could raise her
eyes. Then she met the earnest ques
tionings gaze of the man.
"You may," she said simply. "Dick,
you may."
The rain had ceased and the clouds
had hurried on their way toward tha
east when Peggy and Captain Roberta
entered the reservation and were met
by the jovial colonel.
"Well." he said heartily. "Peggy, I've
had a searching party out for you. but
I just heard that you two were coming
up the river road. This looks bad. bad.
Why. we began to- think that you and
the captain, here, had eloped." â¢
Peggy flushed and glanced at the
younger man. Then she smiled at the
colonel. 8HÂ§P
"We did." she said demurely, "six
years ago."

TRAVELING EQUIPMENTS
TnAVElJTTN'G has been reduced to
a science, and while it is true
that it does not take as many
years of constant application to
master it as it does a host of arts it
cannot be acquired In the twinkling of
an eye.
Just what to take, when to take it
and how to take it is usually the first
and all absorbing question. No one
cares to figure as a first-class Reuben
by dropping down with a carpet-bag
in one hand and a hatbox and paper of
lunch in the other. It looks as though
you had never been out of your tv/o
fcy-four corner of the earth before and
onlookers size you up with a knowing
wink and an expressive "green." First

end the look of amusement that never
fails to be present when the telltale
luggrge ccmes in sight is, 'pi say the
â¢least, anything but reassur'ig.
In this a?e and generation there is
co good excuse for such annoying in
cidents. Good traveling articles are an
economy in the long run, as they out
â la&t the cheaper ones and look far bet
ter after years of use than the others
do after one short trip.
Of trunks there are five distinct kinds,
although there is an endiess variation
cf each one. The skirt trunk, steamer,

THE HAUGHTY DAME
THE haughty dame, the dame of
high degree. Is of many sorts and
kinds.
There Is the pleasant hauteur, in
dicative of ultra teflnement, social
prestigp, culture and the advantages that
come through wealth and an unassailable
position.
The woman who has always enjoyed tfie
blessings that the world calls good is
a creature of different mold from the wo
ir.an who achieves social distinction.
The woman borrkin the purple, who has
never Known anything pave life at Its
best, is the woman who ia able to meet
every situation v.-ith the calm dignity of
experience and is not inflated by homage
or Euecers. Her hauteur is not the accept
ed haughtiness that is acquired and
which is more or less offensive, but It Is
the statrliness and dignity that comes of
birth and pride of race.
In this respect, while correlative with
dignity, the two should not be con-
One is the self-esteem that springs from
birth, the other is the less plausible pride
of possession.
A littje hauteur bler.ded with a certain
ftrnount of gracioupness and the charm of
condescension is most attractive In a
*-r>man.
To be suave and approachable, yet to
maintain a certain dignity, that draws
Â«?vrr eo lightly an invisible line around
one. beyend which no man nor woman
would dare trespass, is to weave around
a woman the mesh of self-respect that
commands Its return, and is both her
glory and her most charming attraction.
The world falls In its obeisance to the
woman of rough and ready manners, who
goes through life In a roughshod way,
forgetful of what iÂ« due herself, and It
cannot be questioned that the surest way
to make others delinquent in lit tie social
formalities Is to be herself careless of
them.
IJke all other failings of women, how
ex cr. thÂ« woman who adopts a hauteur
of manner that Is not born In her, but
mhlch has linn sedulously cultivated, too
often carries It to extremes.
The nouveau richo Is par excellence
the haughty dame. Her haughtiness,
however, is io transparent In . its as
sumption of airs and graces as to bevery
tcatrrlally oppo4iÂ»d to the dlsnlty " that
;he tray serves beautifully for a dinner
frock. This leaves the hatbox and
plenty of space for the thousand and
one accessories that women alway3
need, yet there Is no room to sparÂ°.
What more is necessary unless a host
of merrymakers have been invited and
frocks for all occasions are demanded.
The trunk is small and does not scar>
your hostess into nervous chills for
fear you are contemplating taking up
your residence with her permanently,
and furthermore it can be handled eas
ily by any one, which is a big con
sideration in country peaces. Besides
it has one more virtue which should ap
peal strongly for it. On account of it?
flat top it will serve as a seat and not
utilize too much valuable space, or bet
ter still, it can be pushed under tin
bed and got rid of entirely.
The small h2t trunk is a perfect
treasure and it can be made to serve
twofold. It is a square little affair
with a top tray for gloves and fluffy
fluffs and the trunk proper is composed
of five pad?, one on either side and one
on the bottom, which are made for the
express purpose of fitting, hats into.
Nearly always they are of stiff canvaa
and either snap or buckle into place,
so as many of them may be removed
as you want and the space used jfor
packing other articles of apparel. Yet
at the same time the hat with its
precious plume is held intact and jour
neys to its destination in perfect safety.
What a relief these little trunks are.
Every one can remember without half
trying the struggle of packing a hat. It
was eternally and forever too large one
way and quite too small the other. It
never failed to poke out just where it
shouldn't and was the bane of every
woman's existence. After twisting this
way and turning that way, she finally
â wound up by taking all the trimming
off and trusting to luck to get it on

it into a box and carried it along for
the portets to fall over and the people
generally to sigh and gnash their teeth

comes with good breeding.
The woman who acquires wealth piles
up her airs of self-importance as she
piles up dollars, â  each for each and one
for each.
She has an idea that no one will know
that she has money unless she forces the
evidence before their Immediate atten
tion. She is Imbued with the spirit of
dollars, and deference that Is her due In
mighty installments, at the same time
she loses sight of her own personality
and thinks of herself, not as a woman,
but merely as the representative of a
bank account that should be treated with
obsequious regard, and soon the . person
ality that may have been charming is
merged into the moneyed autocrat, who
carries about her always the trade mark
of sudden plutocracy. ,*."';; J
The woman of millions Is less approach
able than the man, having a more en
larged Idea of her own importance.
The man may forget that he Is so han
dicapped when bending over a glass of
wine, taken in a spasmodic fit of socia
bility, but a woman never forgets when
she is favored beyond the ken of poor
everyday mortals, nor will she allow oth
ers to forget.
The first cultivates the haughtiness of
rcanncr; later comes the haughtiness of
expression.
She sweeps by with her trailing skirts
rustling and bristling with an aggressive
frou-frou. Her very presence is awe-in
spiring, and the frozen stare subdues the
spirit of those inclined to resent her as
sumption of superiority. The lorgnette
is her weapon de resistance, and a glance
through its weird little glasses has a dis
comfiting, irritating influence almost in
describable.
A woman can concentrate more pride,
and more scorn, at the same time convey
a more disagreeable Impression- by one
glance through a lorgnette, than when
reinforced by any other ally.
There Is something uncanny, not to say
almost demoniacal, in this wizard of the
eyes and of fashion that cannot be ex
plained by any cult of the seer.
But that it produces a most disquieting
effect on the person against whom it is
leveled cannot be gainsaid.
The woman who cultivates this haught-
Ineis of manner soon estra^res her
ovei.
But, thanks be, those days are well
over and the woman that boards a
train with ten small bundles that fly
in as many directions is as rare as a
green rose. Instead miladi, in a trig
trotter and a natty hat, armed with a
leather suit case, steps into the car and
amuses herself by watching -others
rather than in counting and keeping
track of her own possessions.
Wait until she opens that case for
some trifle. It is a wonder. Strapped
firmly to the cover is a leather stand
that contains all the various toilet ar
ticles in ebony. They fit so snugly in
friends, whether intentionally or unlnte
tfonally. Sometimes It ia done with mal
ice aforethought, when she suddenly loses
both memory and sight, through finding
it more convenient to forgot or to ignore
the friends of her less prosperous days,
who, not being as generously favored by
fate, can reflect no glory on continued
social intercourse.
She would faint If the nextdoor neigh
bor of the olden times, who minded her
baby while she ran to the corner grocery
for a few pennies' worth of lard or ba
con, were to bow to her, and if this same
good, old-fashioned neighbor were to
presume to call It wouia frighten .my
haughty dame Into screaming hysterics.
Perhaps there might be others to whom
a slight is unintentional, but who, ,not
being so fortunate from a worldly stand
point but yet possessing a large modi
cum of pride are naturally sensitive, and
wait for 'advances to be made to them,
fearing- to seem obsequious or obtrusive.
Friendships arc often dropped, as a re
sult not so much from the arrogance of
the rich as from the sensitive pride of
genteel poverty.
There is, too, another argument against
the assumption of .haughty airs and
graces.
The woman who cultivates this man
ner soon loses the beauty of expression
that has made her face so attractive.
The haughty look becomes fixed until
It degenerates into something so disa
greeable that it is a cross between a
sneer and a smirk. One expressive of
disgust, the other of contempt.
A woman oari seldom adopt the hauteur
of the grande dame so successfully as to
do bo without detriment to her own per
sonality; she- becomes as repulsive and
repellant as she looks, and soon her
friends feel that they must generate a
dynamo of courage before approaching
her. If Hhe escapes becoming 1 downright
ugly, then the special Providence who
looks after fools and children has been
attending strictly to business. .
There is nothing so winning as the en
couraging light in the eyes of sympathy
and the smllo of cordiality on the faca
of a woman.
The- light of welcome that beams, even
before the lips utter the unspoken words,
carries far more weight than the words
themselves, and are a potent charm. An
expressive face is always more attractive
than a beautiful one.

dresser and saves the trouble of carry-
Ing other such articles in the trunk'.
The bureau trunk, /by the way, is the
most convenient one that is made, but
for practical purposes the theatrical
one is by far the best on the market. To
be sure it has no drawers that easily
Blip in and out, nor has it
â¢which means so much .to all femininity,
but it is solid arid sound and is made
to withstand any amount of bumping
and throwing about. The corners are
reinforced with what are termed bump
ers, in reality a solid ball of rubber in
cased in brass, and no matter which
.corner the trunk hits on, it promptly
bounces off and is no worse for wear. â 
For an eastern trip one of these
trunks, which is filled with trays, by
the way, and a hat trunk are all that
is necessary unless you have an un
usually large wardrobe, for a forty-
Inch trunk looks quite like a small
house and is capable of stowing away
all manner of odds and ends.
Skirt trunks are somewhat of a lux
ury for the woman that does not travel
extensively, for r they are always ex*"*
pensive and are exceedingly awkward
to carry about on account of their ex
treme length. Nevertheless they are a
comfort, for there are no ugly, disfig
uring wrinkles and creases to worry
over, for every gown has a tray, bjr
itself and is stretched out full length.
If you are fortunate enough to possess
one It is a pretty conceit to make a
tiny pad of cheesecloth and wadding
and fill it with any perfume that you
like and use exclusively, for by this
means the frocks always retain a faint
sweet odor that is difficult to obtain
otherwise. - i
Perfuming clothes seems a simple
enough trick, but it requires constant
attention and means a constant out
lay of money. Padded drawers must
be replenished every few weeks, the
small scent bags that are showered so
carelessly about must be refilled and
the sweet smelling satin fluffs must be
made over almost constantly. In trav
eling this is not always the easiest
thing possible, nor have you the time
even Jf you have the inclination, so
the pads may be made at home and
the sachet and perfume carried along
without giving them a second thought.
Bottles used to be a perfect bugbear,
but they are dropped Into the midst
of a silk petticoat and a handsome
waist with perfect unconcern, for they
simply couldn't leak or get broken If
they wanted to. a- t â¢< H[f\.J*>'-i
â  In the first; place, while -you do not
want to carry a medicine shop about
when you are on pleasure bent, It is
often the wisest and "safest thing to
have something on hand in case of an
accident. A 'small leather case topped
with a heavy cover that straps into
place contains four fair sized bottles
which may be filled with a stimulant,
camphor, a medicine and perfume, and

.Traveling: equipments certainly have
bsen wonderfully improved upon in the
last few years, but there are hosts pf
fancy pretty trifles that would be more
of a nuisance than a comfort; and the
people who make a business of travel-
Ing are the one3 that carry the least
and the simplest. Generally English
people are looked upon as having the
best of everything in the traveling line
and there are' few that do not carry
soleleather trunks about wlth v them.
They may be all very fit and fine and
there is no gainsaying the fact that
they are strong and durable, but they
always overweigh the luggage limit
and the exceca runs into a pretty penny
before one has scarcely had time to
turn about. For a distance of some
5Q0 miles one" leather trunk costs in
the vicinity of 41 50 excess baggage,
eo they are scarcely what could be
termed a rattling good bargain.
Euit cases and small hand bags
should never be of anything but leathe*
or skins. Alligator bags are extremely
serviceable and always look exceedingly
fit and as though the owner was a
woman of sound sense. Study the bagr
that get off a train or a boat and you
can always tell the class of people they
belong to. Now and again the clothes
may be a trifle shabby, but the in
born look of a gentleman or lady Is
there. For some untold reason people
are prone to judge others . by their
clothes and these days their equipments
are classed as a part of their wearing
apparel. ' I i â 
A lady is , handicapped In carrying
money or Jewels when she is journey
ing, for she does not possess anywhere
from twenty to twenty-five pockets. In
fact, if she possess one she may con
sider herself fortunate. But she has
gotten- around this very nlcery. A>
chamois skin bag has been made that
answers all* purposes. It Is large and
presents a perfectly plain surface, but
when two snaps are unfastened It re
veals a good-sized purse with a strong
steel clasp and two smaller ones on
either side of It. The whole thing Is
fastened about the waist by a bit of
strong material and a stout buckle and
any amount of currency and valuable
jewelry may be carried without the
slightest danger. And paper money Is
what should be taken, as it is light
and easy to handle. Any bank will
gladly exchange coin for paper and a
thousand dollars may be carried about
with no Inconvenience.
Smaller jewel bags may be purchased
or made at home out of a piece of cha
mois and suspended from the neck "by
ribbon, but they are not as strong, and
frequently are a great source of annoy
ance. If you are taking a flying trip
the purse that is attached to a round
garter Is often a convenience, for there
is no. danger of forgetting or leaving
It behind and besides it is easier to get
at than the one that hangs about thÂ«
throat.
A heap has been said about selecting
berths and seats, but It so happens
that it Isn't always what you would
like that you get, but what chances
to be left and It is somewhat of a Hob
son's choice. It is true that the mid
dle of the car rides easier and If you
have a couple of weeks to make ar
rangements in, It Is well enough to se
lect a berth or a section there, but there
are few people who refuse anything
that remains when they are ready to
go or necessity demands it. However,
If you can arrange to be located in a
car in the middle of the train, it Is
wisest and best to do It. Accidents are
very rare, but there is no telling when
they might occur and, as a rule, the
cars in the middle of the train are the
safest/ Those In front frequently catch
on fire and the rear ones fly the track
and are completely ruined, but more
likely than not, the middle ones are
Jammed together with such force that
they come out on top of the pile and
the " occupants escape with nothing
more than a severe shaking up.
If you are going to a strange place It
is 'far better to ask for a guide and
look up the best hotel or ask the porters
or the conductor, for, generally speak
ing, they are walking Information bu
reaus and are always ready and eager
to display their knowledge. Never
grab your belongings in ono hand and
rush madly off the train before it really
comes to a standstill. Everything in

runners, hackmen and baggage men
are shouting 1 at the top of their lungs.
Rather wait and look about you leisure
ly and make up your mind Just what
you want to do. And then do It

It Is always good policy for a lady
traveling alone to stop at the best hotÂ°l
the place affords If she Is obliged to
stop over. There you may feel per
fectly secure and your pocketbook need
not suffer to any great extent either.
If you are backward about going di
rectly to the office a boy is always on

that remains to be done is to tell the
clerk to assign you a room not to ex

In the flower world â dog roses and
forget-me-nots, meadow sweet, the
modest little eyeltright and the blood
red pimpernel, all these have five
petals, neither more nor less â and the
blossoms of the hemlock and the elder
flower, too. If we do but carefully
examine each separate one, of which
the whole beautiful little fairy-like
parasol is composed, we suon perceive
â that every single blossom consists of
five delicate petals, ranged round a
heart-shaped center, generally of a
different hue. Every campanula, even,
has five points or tips to each one of

therefore our hands should serve as
the chalice that collects dew and

also in order to distribute to other be

this reason the liberal hand is ever
the most beautiful â the hand that
freely bestows on others for their
profit arid enjoyment the blessings of
which the accumulated knowledge
and skill of many generations have
made it a partaker. And because the
hand is the most perfect instrument

man it must be worthily employed, in

the delight we feel in watching the
true artist at his work. And is there
anything lovelier than to see a baby
stretch out its tiny hands, with their
sweet shell-like palms and exquisite
roso-leaf fh:gers, to grasp and clutch

If now, as it pleases me to fancy, the

DO YOU EVER TEACH YOUR CHILD TO ASK QUESTIONS?
IT IS perfectly natural for every
health}' child to ask frequent ques
tions. Every sense reaches out
after knowledge. Before he can
speak he looks his questions. After
he can talk he Is always ready to ask
th*m. The parent who undertakes to
answer all the questions which a child
may ask will have but llttla time for
anything else. It Is, therefore, very
hard to 5ay what it is best for a parent
to do with reference to the many ques
tions.
The answer to a question is the be
ginning uf knowledge. But for the an
ewers which a child receives to his
questions he could make no start in
knowledge. His progress ends when he
can no longer receive answers from
bocks or from ether sources. That pa
rent whose child doe3 not desire to ask
questions is to be pitied. He should con
sult a doctor in the hope of discover
ing the cause of the affliction. Such a
child !s in danger of death from intel
lectual starvation.
The tendency of children to ask ques
tions should be rrfade of great use In
the trainins of children. It opens the
door ta the child's mind and to his
heart cÂ£ well. For this reason, If prop
erly understood, they may prove to be
blessings in disguise, not only to the
child, but to the parents as well.
The , natural tendency of the tired
pair :it is to endeavor to repress, or en
tirely prr-vent, the child asking ques
tions. This is very wrong. The effort
whi'.h the parent f-hould make Is to
train the child to ask the right kind of
questions, and to ask them at the
proper time. The parent who can do
this will have little trouble from this
source.
No parent ehould fail to remember
that curiosity is most natural to all,
and especially to children. Since It is
? o, children Ehould not be criticized for
asking questions. The child finds every
thing fu>; of mystery. If he is gifted
with tie average intelligence he can-
as of the horseman's conduct of thÂ«
reins ?
They are alike in all essentialsâ the
little hand whose dainty fingers guide
the needle through some gossamer web
of finest lace, and the massive fist, in
whose gigantic grasp a bar of iron
seems a toy. Down there by the
Rhine, which I see flow past as 1 write,
one pair of busy hands is twining the
rope, with which later on other hands
no less industrious will reef the sails of
one of the many little boats floating
upon the stream. Everywhere upon
the face of the earth men's hands are
employed, with the pen or with the
Fpade, at the easel or the plow, sow
ing, reaping:, building incessantly, for
ever engaged in the inexorable struggle
for life, or collectively toiling in the
carrying out of some great scheme, the
raising of some mighty monument.
And Just this common action it is
which forms an unconscious tie of uni
versal brotherhood, stronger and' fur
ther reaching than the narrower arti
ficial conventions founded on reciproc
ity of interest.
The hand is the link between, man
and man; it signs the pledge of every
social bond, its symbolism plays an im
portant part in all the functions of
public lifeâ whether it be as trie priest
ly hand, uplifted in solemn benedic
tion, or ap the silent witness to spoken
words, -when raised on high to testify
to the sanctity of an oath. Clasped
hands are the emblem of the alliance
of nations as of individuals; the frank
grasp of the hand is the token of loyal
friendship; the outstretched hand the
sign of welcome; the reconciliation
which puts an end to a bitter lifelong
feud is attested by the simple action of
Joining hands. Man's instinctive hom
age to woman is never better expressed
than by the touch of his lips upon her
hands â the chivalrous deference to the
whole sex is most fittingly symbolized
in this simple action. The recognition
of Its high import has caused numer
ous proverbial expressions 'relating to
the hand to pass into our daily speech;
to go through life "hand in hand" has
become synonymous of the most entire
union In thought and deed; we speak of
those who are unduly influenced by
others as having fallen "into their
hands," and the expression "to lend a
hand" is equivalent to giving help in
uny formâ not necessarily of a material
nature. Above all, the supreme beauty
of the hand â its instinctive abhorrence
of the touch that contaminates, of all
base, unworthy action, its shrinking
from aught that might sully its native
purityâ is not all this admirably
summed up in the popular acceptation
of "clean hands" as the symbol pf un
stained honor?
This supreme significance of the hand
in social intercourse has its counterpart
in its importance to the individual or
ganism, where it serves as a swift and
sure medium of correspondence be
tween consciousness and the outer
world. The physical evolution of the
human race scarce records an acquisi
tion so valuable as* that of this sensi
tive and highly elaborated member
which has become â like speech itself â a
vehicle for the rendering in concrete
form of mental conceptions, the dictates
of the will and the impressions of the
senses. In the written characters it
traces, thereby lending enduring form
to the thought of passing generations,
in the figures it models In clay or
carves in imperishable marble, as in the
pictures wherein by means of line and
color it fixes on the canvaa fleeting
scenes of the outer world or still fairer
glimpses of the interior visionâ in all
these processes we perceive the hand
at work as the trained instrument â
almost we might say as the conscious
agent â and the services it renders in
giving objective life to the creations of
the latter are indeed of incalculable
worth. Nor are these services con
fined to the plastic arts alone â though
their action there is paramount and
indispensableâ but music also, that
most ethereal language of the human
soul. Music Itself would lose at least
half of its significance and be shut out
from the sphere of its most complex
development had there not been be
stcrwed upon us, in addition to the sing-
Ing voice, the fingers, whose touch upon
keys or strings has power to draw from
their depths the hidden sweetness slum
bering within. Man's noblest ideas
must in course of time have perished,
sterile and forgotten, had there been
no means of recc-rding them; the high
est flights of the imagination could
not help seeking to find an explanation
for the wonderful things which sur
round him. Yet it Is reported on good
authority that some parents have been
heard to exclaim, "Stop asking me
questions!" "You will drive me
crazy!" "Don't bother me with any
more questions!" "I'll whip you if you
don't stop asking me questions!" The
parents' attitude should rather be
shown by such statements as the fol
lowing: "I am very glad to have you
ask me proper questions about what
you wish to know. I am busy now, but
this evening I will try to answer your
questions." Who will doubt the differ
ence in effect upon any child?-
In answering a child's questions the
parent should remember that, in most
case?, the child Is not -seeking for the
details of knowledge. He generally

But it is above all in its untrained

young children should be very short
and to the point. If parents would but
remember this they would find much
less trouble in answering the many
questions which are sure to come.
Some questions . require - more time
and thought. They therefore cannot
well be answered at the time. This is
especially the case with questions of
older children.' Such questions may be
postponed until a more suitable occa

child should feel that he is free to
ask questions about those things which
are of interest to him, but concerning
which he has no sure means of gain
ing information. If he has a way of
finding the answer by reference to cy-

There is one compensation, to be

Many times parents will be asked
questions which they cannot answer.
If such Is the case a parent should not
hesitate to say, "I do- not know, but if
you are anxious to understand I will
look It up and explain it to you later."
Many parents refuse to do this lest
the children think less of them. Is this
not a mistake? Even the child soon
learns that the field of knowledge is
boundless. He soon comes to know
that it is impossible for any person to
know even a small part of what is to
be known. While to some parents the
whole world is a field, to others a field
is a world. Why, then, should they

tively narrow set of postofflce employes.
Grafting exists openly or under the
nose in every city and town of the land.
For what is grafting? It is the filching
through channels peculiarly accessible
of the individual funds that belong to
a corporation or to - a people at large.
And here we come across a remarkable
and . distressing fact. A man who
would not put hi3 hand. into the pocket
of : his neighbor, who would scorn to
enter a store at night and rob a safe,
will use his connection with a city
government or a great corporation to
enrich" himself at the expense of others.
Somehow it seems so less culpable to
steal from a soulless "corporation or
hands, now outstretched in eager en
treaty, now thrown protectlngly around
some cherished object, or again silently

In their dumb show, defiance or scorn,
wonder, horror and remorse are made
visible to us, as it were by so many
lightning flashes cast upon the somber
drama perpetually being enacted
within the narrow limits of our con
ventionalities, every strong outburst of
natural feeling being so systematically
repressed, that we must needs betake
ourselves to more primitive people,
not be. frank with their children in this
matter,, as in other things?
Again, there are -questions which it
is not right or best that parents should
answer. Such questions may be passed
over with the statement that they can
not be explained now, or that it is not
necessary for them to understand it
at this time. They may be told that
when the time comes all these things
will be made clear to them.
. There are many things which it is not
safe for a child to have. Some would
be injurious, if not fatal. There are
many other things which it is not best
for a child to possess. As his protector,
it Is the parent's business to see that
the child does not get what is injurious.
These things it is easy for the parent
from all the people than to steal from,
say, John Jones. It is one way of
eking out a salary which seems too

must go to the least nourishing of the
Latin nations â the Spaniard^" notably
â or to the Slavs, the Gypsies even,
and the handsomest of so-called sav
age . tribes. Or better still, we must
go back to ages that cherished ajid re
spected the nobility of the hand. It
has been said that the armor worn by
our ancestors in the middle ages ut

of the hand which, wielded their henvy

swords, and that scarcely in any in

by the Crusader allow entrance to his
descendant's broader and clumsier
hand. I think that nowadays we pay
far too little attention to the hand. In
its way quite as interesting and aa well
worthy of study a3 the face, indeed
often affording far surer indication of
our thoughts. To a certain extent we
can control our faces, but how much
less our hands, whose involuntary p:i!
pitations-and pulsatlor.r, not only be
tray â as "thought readers" are well
aware â the sensations of ths moment,
but also give evidence of our habitual
occupations. All hands hive their

considered. The hand hardened by
honest labor is as admirable in its way
as that which guides the pen or pencil.
producing works destined to immor
tality. Sometimes though, innate vul
garity, successfully hidden under ex
terior polish in the rest of the person,
is apparent in the hand alone â some
times even the tendency to crime. It
is as if to hands like these evil clun^r
like "the smell of the blood" that
haunts the sleep of the guilty partner
of Macbeth's usurped throne.
Allusions to the supreme "significance
of the hand are frequent with the p->
ets. Readers of Mrs. Browning's Soii
nets cannot fail to recall that first kiss
imprinted by the lips of the poet-lover
Camoens on "the fingers of this hand
wherewith I write," and the loveliness
of Guinevere "as she swayed the rein
with dainty finger-tips" is also a re
membrance familiar to all. "A hand
like a white-wood blossom." sings an
other English poet In exquisite verse,
while the whole dramatic action ct
perhaps the best known play uf the
great contemporary poet of Italy cen
ters in the lovely hands of its heroine,
the sculptor's wife.
"Oh! for the touch of a vanished
hand!" we all have surely sighed at
some moment of our lives. And who
can think of hands and their beauty
and their charm without calling u>
mind those that the genius of Vandyck
has fixed In imperishable loveliness
upon his canvas, each one of them so
perfect, it would seem as if Art and
Nature could go no further, the one in
furnishing the model, the other tn its
portrayal. Hands such as these fitly
set off in the lace ruffles of those more
refined and happier days, could belong
to none but high and noble natures; the
very soul of the magnanimous Cava
lier seems to speak in them. That was
the age of beautiful hands in Europe,
and who can tell, I ask once more, how
much we may have lost by the neglect
that has succeeded the care and atten
tion then bestowed on them? And do
we value enough, or turn to sufficient
account, the strange power of attrac
tion, the magnetic force known to em
anate from certain hands, whose mi
raculous results have been attested at
all periods and in all parts of the world
âthe laying on of hands, so practiced
In Apostolic ages, and for many centu
ries later, and now fallen into disuse?
But the theme Is so rich in its sug
gestions, these would lead us too far.
It was while sitting at my typewriter
that the perfection of the hand as a
piece of mechanism came upon me with
redoubled force â as I realized all tho
ingenuity and pains which man had
expended in making an instrument
after all so infinitely inferior to the
corresponding instrument in the human
frame. And I realized, too. for the first
time, the incalculable speed of thought.
in the appreciable fraction of time that
intervenes in the transmission of that
thought to the fingers from the brain.
But the result of all my musings was
only as ever to fill me with more and
more wonderment at the divine mys
tery of all creation, and more and more
thankfulness for the blessings that in
that marvelous scheme have been so
fully and freely bestowed upon man.
many children are not denied many
things which do, in reality, do harm?
It Is wrong to give a child every Joy
it wishes. It is positively injurious to
give a child to- eat whatever he asks for.
Every parent must judge for himself
what the child should be denied and
what he should be granted. No parent
should fall to see the importance of re
fusing even though It means tempo
rary pain for the child or even for the
parent. â¢
Childhood should be the happiest
time of life. ! A child should suffer no
more pain than is necessary to proper
ly train him for the life which is to
come. He should not be met with de
nial at every turn. However, the fact
remains that it is of great Importance
that every child should find quite early
in life that his every wish cannot be
granted. Most parents cannot have
nearly everything they desire. To bÂ»
happy In life they must learn to forego
many pleasures they would like to en-
Joy, and jret into the habit of enjoying
greatly those things which they do
have. Thu^. only, will their lives be
happy. Is it not likely that the child
will also fall to get many things he will
wish to have when he is older? Is it
not very important that he should be
trained to take, as a matter of course,
his failures to secure many things he
asks for? Only thua will he be fitted
to meet life's many disapointments.
Most children of the present time ex
pect far more than they should. Their
parents were glad for the wagon made
from an old box, with spools for
wheels. The child to-day Is satisfied
with nothlns less than automobiles of
various sizes and colors. The parent
was glad, perhaps, for a rag doll which
was loved for its hideousness. The
child of to-day must have a whole
family of expensive dolls, made as life
like as possible. The parents considered
themr*lves fortunate If they were
given the privilege of looking at a
book, even though not at all suited to
their age. Now the child la given
many books prepared expressly for
children. Is It any wonder that chil
dren expect much more than it Is nec
essary or best that they should have?

T-T APAN is sitting up and taking no
1 lice! In fact, she opened one eye
\ in 18C4, when Perry's squadron
Qj ran into the bay of Yeddo, for a
quasi treaty was made then and
there between him and the Shogun. In
1S68 Japan opened the other and
proceeded to stare the nations of the
earth straight in the face and de
manded to know just what they meant
by sending their envoys to treat with
the wrong: person.
And, indeed, strange as it seem?.
cueh had been actually the case.
Under an erroneous impression thÂ»
Shogun was thought to be the Em
peror of Japan and all dealings were
accordingly carried en with him. The
title of Taikun was then for the first
time need, and as its literal meaning
is the "great ruler" was employed for
the oecarion by the Tokugawa officials
to convey the distinct impression that
their chief, the Shogun. was in reality
the lord paramount. However, one in
cident, trifling in itself, shows tha^j
i his usurper had some doubts as to his
strength and privileges, for never even
in these early treaties was the title
corresponding to "his Majesty" as
sumed by the Shogun. But he was s<>
shrewd and clever that his actual po
sition remained unknown to the for
eign envoys for over fourteen year.s.
and during these years if he could not
be correctly called the power on the
throne he was at least the power be
hind It.
The office of the all powerful Shogun
or commander in chief o,f the military
power was created In the eleventh cen
tury and was held by sheer force. In
the middle apes the warlike families
in turn seized the throne and kept it
as long as they could, until two rival
clans found themselves about equal in
inliuence and strength.
The Mikado, evidently realizing his
own weakness before these arrogant
military dictators, and, fearing that
i their power might become too great,
tried to p!ay them off one against
the other. For instance. If one of the
Taira rebelled the Emperor authorized
the Minamoto to rebuke him, and as
a consequence both clans were only too
delighted to obtain an imperial com
mission against the other. Incessant
intrigue ana even bloodshed was the
order of the day until the twelfth cen
tury, when the questicm wag finally
settled in open warfare. Torttomo, the
leading spirit of the Minamoto, was
the victor, and he straightway -went
to work to set up a kingdom of his
own and never once did he falter until
he had built a city that was the capi
tal of East Japan.
To such an extent did he overawe
the neighboring provinces that in 1192
thÂ«- Emperor dispatched a special en
voy to invest him with the office of ttia
Shogun (literally, "barbarian-subjugat
ing generalissimo") and he and each
Shogun who came after him were thus
. nominated commanders In chief whose
duty it was to preserve peace and
tranquillity in Eastern Japan.
Thus the creating of another great
power gave rise to the common belief
that Japan really possessed two em
perorsâone "spiritual," residing at
Kioto, and the other "temporal," resid
ing at Kamakura and afterward at
Yeddo. As the Emperor is believed to
be an "earthly deity," or son of a demi
god, this idea was not unnatural, for
while the Shogun owed allegiance and
was invested by the Emperor, his new
position as supreme head of the mili
tary force, and his influence over the
powerful lords of the country made
him In reality almost the equal of tho
sovereign in his own right. Such a
state of affairs, strange as it was,
lasted until the revolution in 1868, â¢
when the Shogun's power was pitifully
shattered and the Mikado reinstated in
his all-supreme position.
Of course the two courts of the rul
ers could not help Lut differ greatly.
The attendants of the Emperor were
the o!d court nobles, descended from
the imperial line, and hile mapy of
them possessed anything but ample
means, their rank was recognized by
all classes. On the other hand, the
court of the military leader was vastly
different. Instead of birth, ability
counted and the men who were noted
lor their warlike skill and great terri
torial possessions were the ones who
found favor.
This in itself gave rise to the feudal
system that was inaugurated in Japan.
The powerful territorial nobles were
called the daimio and the petty nobility
the latamoto. The latter, about 80,000
strong, resided constantly at Yeddo,
but the daimio were forced to come to
the city only at stated Intervals, and
spent the rest of their time at their
castles in their provinces. One thing
they were obliged to do, however, to in
sure their good behavior, and that was
to leave their wives and families be
hind as a sort of a hostage. As the
power of the Shogun became more and
more strong he slowly but firmly placed
restrictions and terms upon the daimio,
until they were treated solely as feudal
vassals, with a host of regulations that
they were forced to follow out.
Instead of being a united empire
that acknowledged the Mikado as its
sovereign, Japan was portioned out
into any number of fiefs, that were in
reality petty kingdoms. Each fief was
ruled by a daimio, â¢ assisted by some
councilors and a few other officials, but
the daimio was supreme in his own fief
and settled such matters as taxes and
the issuing and valuation of paper
money.
Such a rule was thoroughly bad
in more ways .than one. A per
son traveling: was put to a great
deal of inconvenience, for his money
was not good outside of his own terri
tory, and it put him to an endless
amount' of trouble and expense to make
an exchange in order that he might
travel comfortably and in style befit
ting his rank. Again, the power to tax
was frequently turned Into -abuse. In
some cases, to be sure, the position of
the wretched peasantry was duly con
sidered, but the great majority of times
the ruler cared little how â¢ much .he

But this' state of affairs couldn't go
on forever. Petty jealousies and quar-
rels were constantly arising among the
daimio themselves, until finally the sa
cred palace of the Shogun was dese
crated with bloodshed and strife. Every
person in Japan, whether great or sim
ple, rose simultaneously, and the revo
lution in '68 was a complete restoration
of the Mikado to his rightful own.
The Shogun was declared an usurper
and the only thing that was left for
him to do was to retire, which he did
in 1867, to ; the province of Suruga
with only the .title .of a lord of the
empire, and with 'his passing the
ancient form of government returned
and the feudal- system" that had been
such a powerful factor was entirely
destroyed." ' /
From a nation that was in seclusion
from the rest "of .the world and that
hated 'outsiders to such an extent that
any of Us inhabitants were forbidden
to leave- its sh'ores under penalty of
death, Japan suddenly waked up and
the progress that she has made has
been something truly astounding. She
suddenly came out of her long sleep,
and aided and abetted by Marquis Ito,
who is really the connecting link be
tween new and old Japan, has rapidly
come to be considered a power in the
world.
Ito wa3 a boy of 12 when Perry ran
into the bay of Yeddo. He was a noble
man, although of the lowest grade,
and, as a consequence, was being
schooled in the matters of etiquette
and tea ceremonies and to consider
himself one of the flowers of his be
loved nation. Being a retainer of the
Shogun, he was frequently sent on
political missions to Toklo, but instead
of regarding the foreigners that were
commencing to pour Into the port as
the dust beneath his feet, he made it
his business to learn all he could about
them "and their customs and ways.
When he reached the age of 19 he
was fully convinced that his Govern
ment would never be able to exclude
the 'foreigners and he resolved to pay
them a visit in their own land. With
five friends he led the way to the
home of a British merchant, one Mr.
Keswick, who had promised -to help
him when he was called upon to do so.
After evading the authorities they
finally reached a ship, but the captain
stubbornly refused to permit them to
sail with him. He wouldn't run the
risk of breaking: the Japanese law and
of being refused an entrance to their
port. Besides he might cause trouble for
his own country. But, though Ito little
dreamed that he would later be Pre
mier, of his country, he displayed the
same forethought that has always
made him' stand Out distinctly above
his fellows.
Thinking that there might be trou
ble, he had persuaded his boyish
friends, intent on what they consid
ered a lark, to cut off their queues.
Japan would no longer recognize them
as Japanese and as noblemen they
would not stand the degradation and
either they sailed on that ship or com
mitted suicide by the refined code of
hara-kiri. The result waa they sailed,
for the captain was between the devil
and the deer> blue sea. Five dead
men would Le harder to account for
than five live ones.
This was Ito's first lesson with the
outside world, and it taught him that
the noblemen of Japan, accustomed
to- idling" away their time with fans
and being waited on hand and foot,
were no better than anybody else, and
if the truth were, told not considered
half as good. While they paid their
full fare; and. went as passengers, the

captain considered It his bounden
duty to get even with them for forc
ing him to take part in their flight,
and they were made to do the work
of common sailors, which in their eyes
was a great disgrace. To do the work
of a low bred coolie was bad enough,
but to do it for the despised foreign
er was the last dregs of a very bitter
cup.
Yet Ito was philosopher enough to
admit a fact, however unpleasant it
might be, and when he saw the prog
ress of other countries he realized that
Japan simply had to change her en
tire code of civilization or be ruled
under a foreign flag.
Eight months' constant duty had
passed In England when they received
word that a port in their own province
was about to be bombarded on ac
count of the harassing of foreign ves
sels that approached too near the hos
tile shore. All the love for their coun
try came to the front in an instant
and the five refugees, disguised as
Portuguese, rushed home to give their
lord the benefit of their occidental
study. Eut their persuasion amount
ed to nothing â the barbarians wer*
told to do their worst, and that worst
leveled the city of Kagoshima to thÂ»
ground and sent what was left of a
tiny army rushing? away looking and
calling for protection.
Then it was that Ito and his clow
and lasting: friend. Count Inouy*
stepped in and practically revolution
ized the Government. The boys that
returned were In constant danger for
they had violated one of the moct
zealously guarded laws and ths pen
alty had not been dealt out. But thay
were so necessary, with their new and
advanced ideas, and the clouds that
already cast their shadows over ths
islands looked so heavy and threaten
ing, that they were chosen as advisers
instead and their instructions wÂ«rÂ«
faithfully and fully carried out.
Things that had never been heard of
were actually accomplished in thÂ»
twinkling of an eye and prejudices
that had lived through centuries wera
brushed as lightly away as though
they were cobwebs. Instead of war
being a sort of pastime for the noble
men it became a business for every
body.
For the first time In the history of
Japan common men stood side by sldÂ»
with the gentry, and the Mikado had a
trained army that had strength and
foVce behind it.
Modern Japan is perhaps due more
to Ito than any one or anything else.
and his has been the great power that
has been felt for the past twenty or
more years. Whether he was the Pre
mier or whether he was the power be
hind the Premier ha3 mattered little to
him as long as he accomplished his
ends â and that ha3 been to see his
country rank with the nations of the
earth, commercially, socially and. in
fact, in every other way. To be felt as
a world power has been his ambition,
and never for a single instant has he
relinquished his grip of iron.
"A nation cannot stand still." he once
said. "It must go forward or back
ward. Expansion is a natural law. Ac
cept everything that comes to you."
and he might have added, "if you see
any possibilities of its coming go half
way or more to meet it." So la it any
wonder that Japan has come to the
front in such an amazing fashion in
these late years? With such a power
ful hand steering her she could scarcely
do otherwise but sail straizht Into her
destined port.RECOLLECTIONS AND REFLECTIONS

To send acceptable strangers to a
distant Territory, as England sent her
ancient spinsters in the eighteenth
century around the Cape of Good Hope
"for India and a market," is a task
the performance of which is not free
from difficulty. It is the lame ducks
who seek a chance to swim In distant
â waters. It is the cripples of politics
who desire to carry their limps to a.
new land. It is those who have been
discarded by conventions or who have
been beaten at the polls who seek the
Territorial offices, and Congressmen
and Senators who have succeeded are
only too anxious to provide abroad
for those maimed ones who cannot* be
j.roiided for at home, and so the Ter
ritories have often, despite of national
convention resolutions, been made of
fal heaps on which to deposit the
ETrecpings of Eastern caucuses.
Hawaii was freed from the blessing
or Llijht of non-resident appointments
through the insertion by Congress in
.her organic act of a clause providing
that appointments should be made only
from those who had been three years
rfcfiifnt In the Territory. This clause
was not after all an unmixed blessing,
because of local conditions never exist
ing in any other Territory. There was
nit a man in Hawaii of sufficient abil
ity nr character to be fit for Territorial
office who had not actually either
foupht or favored annexation. Hawaii
did not come to the arms of Uncle Sain
a biushing but willing bride. She was
married a la Sabine, with a black eye
and a bloody nose for her trousseau. I
am hot proposing to discuss here or at
this day the wrongs of Queen Liliuo
kelani or the righteousness of the acts
of these who struck her crown from
her head. Hawaii Is with us now, for
good and all, and I rejoice, as every
.American citizen ought to rejoice, that
the flag is there, however it got there.
But the problem which annexation
created ought not to be ignored. It has
ever been the policy of wise victors to
reconcile and not to irritate the van
quished. Rome made friends of Goth
and Gaul by enrolling them under her
eagles and sending them to fight In Af
rica. Diaz transformed captured ban
dits into policemen by giving them
their choice between death and enlist
ment. "Great men gain doubly when
they make foes friends." The Governor
and executive officers and Judges of
Hawaii had to be appointed either
from those who helped annexation or
from those who fought it. and as be
tween those two factions It was logical.
It was. Indeed, inevitable, that the an
nexationists should receive the places.
Under all the circumstances most of
the appointments were successes. The
present Circuit bench averages well for
Independence and ability. The Supreme
bench, although somewhat saturated
\vi:h the ideas of paternalism acquired
under a monarchial government, is rea
sonably fair, and is certainly rigidly
hc::est, rind Governor â now United
Etctes District Judge â Sar.ford B. Dole
has eureiy most successfully steered his
Efcip of Etate through vexed waters.
His successor. George A. Carter, has
his record to make. He is a Harvard

conf.dence of his friends and the re

Hawaiian legislatures and courts
have followed California precedents and
California prejudices In dealing with
the Chinese. As early as 16S1 the Su
prerr.c Court of California set the pace
in People vs. Ha!!, reported In 4th Cali
fornia 339. that the evidence of a Chi
i.nman would not be received in a Cal
ifornia court because, not being
v.hite, be was therefore black, that be
ing black- he was therefore a neirro
â within the meaning of the California
r.tatuU-, which excluded negroes from
the witness stand.
And in order to clinch the matter the
court further decided that when Co
lumbus discovered America he was
loolclng for India and supposed that he
had found it; that he therefore called
the aborigines "Indians"; that the
terra W2S generic; that India and Asia
were convertible terms; that a China
man being an Asiatic was therefore
an Indian, and being an Indian was
prohibited by law from * testifying
against a white man, and so Mr. Hall,
the proud Caucasian who had been im
properly convicted on negro-Indian
testimony of shooting a Chinaman into
glory, was ordered to be released.
Later this class of legislation was
ittvept from the statute books, and a
Chinaman was allowed to testify, but
courts and juries reserved the privilege
of not' believing him.
The Chinere are 'cunning as well as
Hand, and they entirely appreciate the
nics points of a lawsuit. I have had,
i;i the course of my practice, a fewChl
ncse ciients. but nose do I bear In mind
as more coo! and collected .than Sam
Lee. He was a hi- ./â¢Inder. a fantan
dealer, a fist and gun fighter and an
r."-round Chinese bad man. He was ac
cused \>y Â« fellov.- Celestial of assault
with in: rut. to commit murder, and I
was employed to defend the accused.
Tin* prose :-V7!r"- witness was *a little.,
weazened old Chinaman, who compre
hended no English and testified through
an interpreter.. He mounted the wit
ness stand with woebegone features
and his arm in a 6!ln<- from the effects
of a wound inflicted by my client.
From what Sam Lti 1 \ told me I had
lillle hopp of securing his acquittal, un
less I could break down or exclude tha
testimony of the prosecuting witness.
With this laudable end in view I asked
of the Justice the privilege of examin
ing the witness on his voir dire. His
Honor did not kn. xr exactly what a
voir dire was, but I was persona grata
In hi3 court, and he blandly granted
my request.
"Ask this man," said I to the inter
preter, "if he understands the nature of
an oath."
The accomplished linguist who ren
dered the Chinese vernacular into
pidgin English and transformed Eng
lish slang into pidgin Chinese. Jabbered
away for a moment, received the reply
of the witness and responded, "All
light; he say he sabe." .
"Well, if he understands the nature
of an oath, let him explain it."
Again the interpreter Jabbered and
again the witness responded In Chinese.
"He say suppose he tell lie Melican
Judge send him State's plison and by
and by when he go die he go stlaight
to helle."
The witness reFponded with more of
animation than before and pointed his
uninjured arm at my client, Sam Lee,
and the interpreter, with a face like a
graven image, and as If unconscious of
the death blow he was inflicting upon
my case, replied, "He say, suppose .he
tell tluth, Melican Judge send Sam Lee
Stlate's plison." . \ - '
But he didn't, because Sam Lee had
thr*e witnesses who testified that the
little, old Chinaman was the aggressor
in the affray.
When the suit brought by the
United States to condemn land at Pearl

ness a Chinaman who In former years
had leased and cultivated th^ land. The
court refused to admit the evidence,
saying: "'The court and the jury has
been on the land and we all know that
nothing will grow on it. If you want
to prove to the contrary you must do
it with white witnesses. I will not lis
ten to Chinese testimony on the sub
ject."
As it happened, there were white
witnesses and their evidence confirmed
the statement that a crop had been
raised upon the land.
On another occasion, when trying a
bankruptcy case in which one of the
petitioning creditors was a Chinese cor
poration, the same Judge refused to al
low the books of the corporation In evi
dence because they were kept in Chi
nese. "We are now," said he, "an
American Territory."
On still another occasion a Chinese
building contractor living and doing
business In Honolulu, and having many
men in his employment, sent to China
for a woman who had been betrothed
to him since boyhood. According to
Chinese custom and law. they were
married. In China before she departed,
the bridegroom, being represented by
his mother. Arrived at Honolulu, the
woman was detained and her deporta-
WHEN LUCIEN'S GRANDMA CAME
pr? -^Tjj O UNG Lucien Davis,

'iK^iP lr *^li er> dau & hter oi the
I *A^^5&Â£fe)t [$ village miller, for six
trrmrtTTtasin^M months or more when
Grandma Whltbeck
came on a visit. She was moth
er to Mrs. Davis, and although
over GO years old it was her
boast that she could still make thing3
hum. Lucien was her favorite grand
child and she made no secret of the
fact that she had made her will in
his favor. In her Western home she
had heard that he was "keeping com
pany" with a girl, and that it would
probably be a match, and that reason,
more than any other, brought her
East in midwinter.
Grandma Whltbeck arrived in Sun
nyside at an unfortunate hour. The
river running through the village was
frozen two feet thick and was being
used as a boulevard and race course
by every villager who had a horse and
cutter. There were some good horses
and some drivers who were anxious to
head the procession, and among the
latter was Lucien Davis. It was a
natural thing that Tilly Spooner
should be with him as he drove, and
that she should clao her hands in glee
when the cutter crossed the line fifty
feet ahead of the next best horse for
ten miles around. Grandma' happened
to be crossing the bridge during one
of the trials of speed and saw it all,
and as she continued to gaze her jaw
began to set. . . -- 4 '

tion to China demanded under the pro
visions Â«-â¢?' the exclusion act. A writ
of habeas corpus was sued out and the
release of the woman demanded an the
ground that she and her husband had
been married in. China by proxy, ac
cording lo Chinese law, and that as
the husband had .a right to remain, In
the United States hta wife had a right
to be here also. % The District Attor
ney demanded the deportation of the
woman on the ground that the Chinese
marriage was not a legal marriage, be
cause the bridegroom was at the time
"doing the grand in a distant land, 6000
miles away." He. claimed tiiat the nec
essary pro verba was lacking, and that
the marriage had never been consum
mated anyhow, because the bride since
her arrival had cried all the enanvif off
her pretty little face in the seclusion
of the cell in which tha United States
had incarcerated her. a.^.i the bride
groom had not been permitted to . see
her, except in the custody of three
stalwart deputy United States Mar
shals. It was insisted in reply that a
marriage good tla the place where it
was contracted is good any where;, that
the husband being lawfully here, had
a right to have his wife with him, and
that she could not" be classed as a la
borer because she was a little-footed
woman, and, therefore-, incapable^ of
work of any kind..
His Honor was usually a kind-heart
ed and Just man, but he naturally hated
Chinese, and he glanced at the couple
a.nd continued the further hearing of
the case until Monday. The Marshal
Informed the court that the Govern
ment had neglected to provide him with
facilities for caring for ladles. That
the limited Jail accommodation was oc
cupied by sailors, sleeping two in a bed
and two. beds in a room, and he asked
the coujt what he should do with tns
woman. - "Do the best you can," said
his Honor' In reply. "Probably you can
obtain her quarters with some of her
countrymen. See that you produce her
here on Monday morning."
The Marshal was a sensible and
kind-hearted man. He deputized i
wealthy Chinaman to care for the lady
at his home. This custodian did not
deem it his duty to separate their guest
from the gentleman to whom under
Chinese law.s she was united in holy
matrimony. The next morning the
couple, attended by their friends, cams
to me for further consultation. They,
were advised to go to the proper office 1
and obtain a marriage license, and on'
their return the Presbyterian ministt-r
was telegraphed for. On his arrival
the situation was explained. He was
reluctant until his attention was called
to the fact that every necessary con
stituent element of a" marriage already,
existed, except 'the sanction of the
church, and that in the interest of pub-'
lie morality the ceremony should take
place. Vis a law ofilce a proper place- 1
for this sort of Ihing?" said be. .- "Sire,"',
said I, In the language of Richelleu.i
"for justice all place a temple." He?
yielded" and joined those who were
fairly well joined before, but he com
pleted the Job.
On Monday morning when the case
was callorl the license to marry and
the certificate of marriage were of
fered In evidence and the petitioner
rested. And then there was a circus.
His Honor roasted the Marshal for
permitting the marriage and then he
went for me. He said in substance,
though not in word.", that out of con
sideration- for my family and my gray
hairs he would not imprison me and
out of consideration for my empty
pockets he would not fine me, but that
I had been guilty of a grave contempt
of court, deserving of the severest con
demnation, that my conduct was rep
rehensible and disgraceful and a. lot of
other things, and he ended by declar
ing- that the evidence offered of a mar
riage in Honolulu would not be re
ceived and that the ceremony amount
ed to nothing. It was suggested to
his Honor that if the ceremony
amounted to nothing then no harm
had been done, and that the parties
had as good a right to amuse them
selves ad interim by a marriage act as
by playing solitaire or golf. The Judge
paid no attention to this reply. Then
to is sickin' him on the best she knows
how. I've got to see about this thing
right away."
She did. She hadn't got her bonnet
off before she was sayin' to her daugh
ter:
"Sarah Davis, it seems as if Provi
dence had sent me here at this time.
Do you know what Lucien is doln' at
this very minit?"
"He's driving on the ice, I believe,"
was the reply.
"Drivin"! Why,, he's, hoss-racih*,
that's what he's doln' â goin' up arid
down Itckety-spllt, arid that Spooner
gal, about who you've all been writin'
so much, is. in the cutter with him
and a-sickin' him on! I stopped on
the bridge and . saw it all, and I'm
goin' to tell you right omt plain that
I'm ashamed of you. I never 'spected
to live to see the day when you and
James would see Lucien become a
hoss-racer and a gambler and a mur
derer and" never even advise him
agin it."
"Come, come, mother," chided the
daughter. "They may be driving fast,
and one horse' may come out ahead of
the other, but It's not horse-racing.
There- are people driving* on the ice
â who belong to the church. It's simply
recreation. I was driving with " Lu
cien 1 myself yesterday and I enjoyed
it Immensely."
"Don't talk to me, Sarah Davis. I
know a hoss-race when I see one, and
I know that hoss-racin" leads to gam
blin'' and murder. If folks around
here think they can be Christians and
hoss-race at the same time let 'em go
ahead, but I can tell 'era where they'll
end up. I was in hopes I should take
a- . likln' to that Spooner gal, but I
never, never can. Any gal who will

he decided that as the husband occa
sonally â  directed his -workmen how to
drive nails or hold paint brushes he
was therefore a laborer* within the
meaning of the act of Congress; that
the exclusion act only suffered Chinese
merchants to come to this country;
that every Chinaman who was not a
merchant was a laborer and must be
excluded. 'WSUm

ought to be sent to Jail, and I'll tell
her so whenever I see her."
When Lucien came home he got a
bad roasting from grandma. He tried
to explain, but It was no go. Grand
ma had her opinion, and it was:
"It ain't a bit of use to waste your
breath, Lucien. I'm disappointed in
your father and mother and in you.
When I was here last you were split
tin' wood and studyin' your Sunday
school lesson all the time, When ; l
come this' time I find you hoss-racih'
and v on your way. to State's prison. I
feel it my duty .to save you if I can,
and; I'm goin* to try and think up a
way to do it." r . * ;â¢ "
The" idea- was to propitiate : grandma
as much as possible, and yet Lucien
did not cease to "hoss race" now and
then, and to taka Tilly Spooner along
as he had before.* The family would
like to; have brought about an intro
duction between the girl and the old
lady, but it was looked upon as .too
risky. Little was said after the first
two or three days, . but grandma kept
up a great thinking, with the result
that one ; dayi two weeks later, she
slipped <out* of - the house and made a
call at Spooner's. ; It was a call that
left its! mark. She reproved Mrs.
Spooner, wondered what sort of a man
Mr. Spooner ; wag, . and wound up by
calling .Tilly an impertinent minx. Of
course, ' there were results, and those
results made at least two hearts ache.
Lucien was informed in plain English
that .' if he didn't '. "drop ' that gal" he
would be dropped { out" of grandma's
will,':'; and, though he refused'/, to be
bluff ed, the situation became , strained
arid- anything ' but â¢ pleasant. It -was
Tilly herself who solved the problem
where others failed to see a glimmer of
light. '. .-, .. â¢
One day Lucien had business over
toward Liverpool, and as it was a
bright February day he asked grand
ma to go along. She was glad to get
out and see the country and she meant
to take advantage of the occasion to
haveÂ» a long, private talk with the
young man. After a drive of two miles
and 'a halt at a farm house for a mo
ment, ; Lucien headed the horse back
home, and before grandma knew where
she was the outfit wan on the ice along
TJRh^twenty others.
.""Jjucten, what does this mean?" she
demanded. . ; ' ' *â 
"It's our nearest way home, grand
ma." â¢
The horse started off at a good pace,
but after, a couple of minutes two or
three others began to draw up to him.
In five minutes Grandma Whitbeck be
gan to wriggle around. In six or seven
she became so nervous that she asked:
;!â¢. "Lucien,' what do them fellers back
there want?" \
"They want to' pass me and crow
over it," he replied.
Just then two of the cutters did pass,
and the drivers looked back and grin
ned. Lucien held his horse down, how
ever, - and he 'pretended not to mind it
â¢when he was passed by two or three
others.
"You see, I'm Just out for a drive,"
he explained to "grandma.
"Yes, I know.-? Could they pass you
if you didn't want 'em to?"
"Hardly. : I' hate'. to be grinned at
and ' crowed over,' but I know it's wick
ed to -'speed horses.""
' '.'Yes,' of course 'it is," butâ "
,-.i Just . then . an old . crowbait V attached
to a home-made sled ' came up and
passed the cutter at a jog and the half
dozen boys f on ; the sled . had some , cut
ting remarks to make. Grandma did
and must tread the steep and thorny
road of celibacy and consequently
the bride must go back to China by
the next steamer.
On hearing this decision translated to
her the poor little woman gave a shriek
some more wriggling, but she didn't
say anything until the mark was
reached and the horse had been turned
around for a straight mile course to
the bridge. Then she observed:
"Luclen, I don't like to be made a
laughing stock of."
. "Nor I, either."
"Then, if any more crowbalts come
up you might shake on the lines a
leetle." ";;;' â 
"But there are five or six men with
good horses who will surely try to beat
"Then shake a leetle harder."
One of the good horses presently
came pounding up behind, but Lucien
seemed oblivious. ' , r
"I said shake the lines," remarked
grandma.
The young man shook, but the
horse still gained and others were
heard coming u,p.
"Shake harder!" .
Lucien clucked, but he did not draw
away from the danger. Grandma
waited until the nose of a' horse was
level with her arm and then said:
"Lucien â¢ Davis, if you let me be
laughed at you are no grandson of
mine. Make your hoss git up and
git."
Three seconds later she was riding
at a 2:40 clip and holding on to her
breath and bonnet, and three min
utes later the bridge was passed and
she knew that she had led by a hun
dred feet. She hadn't a word to say
v on the way from the river. to, the house
nor for half an hour after. Then she
put her. hand on Lucien's shoulder and
observed: ;
, "I guess things have changed since
I was a gal. I guess that beatin'- the
other hoss hain't hoss racin' or gam
blln* or murder, and you'd better
bring Tilly Spooner over here to-night
to hear me say so."
and, flinging her arms around her hus
band's neck, ciung. to him, sobbing and
crying. Court adjourned, the day
waned and the electric bulbs were Il
lumined, but no myrmidon of the law
in that courtroom moved to separata
them. I suggested that an apveal might
be taken from the decision and that,
pending the appeal, the Judge, who
was really a kind-hearted man. and
who was conscientious In, his decision,
might grant a stay of the order of de
portation.
And then the husband for the first
time gave utterance to his view of the
case. "No." said he, "I take no appeal.
I flaid Amelican law. I fiaid Amellcan
Justice. I live here many years. I
build great many houses. I buy plenty
Melican goods. I pay evelyblody. I
pay taxes. I no har. anybody. My

MRS. JEMIMA LUKE, AUTHOR OF "I THINK WHEN I READ THAT SWEET
STORY OF OLD," WILL BE SOLD OUT FOR GOVERNMENT TAXES
Rather Than Pay for Education in
an Alien Creed, Aged Writer
Makes a Sacrifice.
LONDON*. Feb. 27.â Some time this
epring there is to be a little auction sale
at Newport, Isle of Wight, that is like
ly to stir the blood of every one In the
United States who has ever sung in
Sunday-school that sweet old hymn, "I
Think When I Read That Sweet Story
of Old," written by Mrs. Jemima Luke.'
The aged author of that hymn has re
fused, for conscience sake, to pay a
tax imposed by the British Government
for the education of children In an
Episcopal creed, in which the gentle old
lady, being a Congregationalist. cannot
believe. So in due course she is to re
ceive a visitation from the Sheriff's of
ficers and enough of her small property
is to be seized and sold to satisfy the
unyielding demands of a law not unlike
that which drove the Pilgrim fathers
from Plymouth. Enpland. to Plymouth
Rock, Massachusetts.
Mrs. Luke is only one of an army of
God-fearing folk who are ready to pay
the rest of their taxes but have vowed to
withhold that iiart which was to be de
voted to compulsory education of their
children in religious doctrines in which
the parents did not believe. At present
there are 100,000 of these "passive resist
ers." as they are called, and up to the
date of writing 7400 of them have been
served with summonses, and more
Ifss household goods of 350 have been
sold to satisfy the Government.
MUST YIELD TO THE LAW.
Mrs. Luke writes me that the tax
patherer has not yet called for her con
tribution to this fund, but that when
ever he does call she will not pay it and
will submit to the consequent summons
and sale. Her daughter-in-law, Mrs. E.
E. Luke of Manchester, who is equally
lirm in her belief that the education
rate, as it is called, is iniquitous, has
already been summoned to court and
had enough of her goods sold to meet
ihe amount she has withheld.
You may be sure that in the case of
Mrs. Jemima Luke the education rate
has not been resisted from motives of
economy, as can be judged from a lit
tle note I received from her the other
day. I had asked her for a photograph
and pome information about herself,
and on receipt of it I sent to her a
modest check to cover the expense and
trouble In which I had involved her.
That check came back by return mail,
with this little note:
â¢I thank you much for your kind in
c!r.Â«ure, but I do not need any repay
ment fcr a simple act of courtesy. If
you know some poor, struggling author
with a family please give it to him. I
rÂ«=inc!ose the check and am. yours
faithfully, JEMIMA LUKE."
For the benefit of applicants it may
be stated hÂ«>re that the poor, struggling
author with a family has been already
found.
MRS. LUKE VERY FEEBLE.
Mr*. Luke is now over 90 years old
;ind so feeble in health that the writ
ing ol letters has become difficult for.
her. It may therefore be looked upon
es a special favor to readers of this
paper that Mrs. Luke wrote out for
them, in her own hand, the first stanza
of the hymn which has made her
famous from one end of the* world to
the other.
The author of the hymn was might
:Jy surprised to find herself a celeb
rity aF the result of her unpretentious
verses, not realizing that their sweet
ness and simplicity were qualiti- at
all rare in this wicked old world.
The details with which she supplies
me as to how the hymn came to be
â written seem somehow to match the
serene beauty of the face in the ac
companying photograph.
Mrs. Luke's father, a well to do
English country gentleman named
Thompson, had been one of the found
ers of the Sunday School Union and
the originator of the Home Mission
ary Society in 1*17. His life was large
ly given to organizing missionary work
ar.d it was only natural that his
daughter should become absorbed at
an early age in the same interests. She
yearned to go to India as a mission
ary, but the death of her invalid
mother threw the care of the house
on her shoulders. Then when her
father married again and she was once
more free to go and had taken the
necessary course of studies, she was
held back by illness almost at the mo
ment the ship sailed and her heart
seems to have been almost broken by
the ultimate decision that her health
would not permit her to undertake
such arduous work in so trying a cli
mate.
WRITES FAMOUS HYMX.
Lil;*- the brave girl she was. she
swallowed her disappointment and
plungc-d into Sunday school work. One
inorr.ins in 1S41. when she was 28
>ears old. she was traveling in one of
the funny old fashioned coaches of
the djy :o a distant village to see how
one of her missions was getting on.
There was no other inside passenger
and so to pass the time she began to
bcribble verses on the back of an.en
velope. By the time she had reached
her destination she had completed two
stanzas of the hymn by. which her
4uunf will be remembered for many a
year to come. "A third verse* was
afterward added," writes Mrs. Luke,
"to make it u missionary hymn. I
never thought of printing those sim
ple verses. My father superintended
the SuTiday school at the little chapel
belonging to the estate. He used to
let the children choose the first hymn
themselves. One Sunday afternoon
they struck up their new hymn. My
father turned to/ny young sisters, who
Flood near him, and said:
"Where did that come from? I never
heard it before?"
" "Oh, Jemima made it,' " was the re
ply.
"On the Monday he asked me for a
copy of the words and tune. This he
sent, with name and address in full,
to the Sunday School Teachers' Maga
zine." ;. i â â â¢â ;â '
One immediate result of the publica
tion of the hymn was to bring to Je
mima Thompsonâ as she then wasâ the
offer to edit a missionary magazine for
children called the Missionary Reposi
tory.
'It was suitable and congenial wcrrk,"
she writes, "and 1 welcomed it as gra
ciously sent from above to fill up the
blank In my pro-spects. I soon beedme
much interested in the undertaking and
the circulation increased rapidly. It
was not limited to one missionary so
ciety, but gathered facts .of interest
from all. It brought me some delight
ful correspondents, and among my
most kind and faithful helpers were
James Edgerton, Robert Moffat,
James Montgomery, Anna Braithwaite,
E. M. Jackson and Mrs. Mortimer of
"Peep of Day' celebrity. One contribu
tion came from Dr. Livingstone; also
letters of encouragement from Isaac
Taylor, Dr. Harris and Bishop Sum
ner, afterward Archbishop of Canter
bury."
In connection with the magazine
work the editor wrote one day a short
missionary story to be read to chil
dren, which was received so well that
in time thirty little books of the sort
came to be written by her, of which
half a million copies were circulated.
"* : unday schools in these days," says
Mrs. Luke, with pardonable pride,
"contribute many thousands to the
funds of their various missionary so
cieties, and, as is often the case with
great movements, their adhesion to the
cause had this small and simple be
ginning. It is also from the ranks of
Sunday school teachers that the forces
of the missionary societies have been
continually supplied. The Missionary
Repository has long sir.ee died a nat
ural death, but it lives in its succes
sors, each missionary society now hav
fng its half-penny missionary maga
zine for children, and missionary liter
ature of world-wide interest is con
stantly issuing from the press."
MARRIES AT THIRTY.
At the age of SO^years this energetic
champion of missions was married to
the Rev. Samuel Luke, a Congrega
tional minister. She was twenty-five
years a wife and has been thirty-five
years a widow. "Lonely as the life may
be," she says naively, and with a sigh
rt the thought of her never conquered
/earning to be a misionary, "and much
as one may miss the dear companion-
Ehip, what a blessed thing it is not to
be a Hindoo widow!" To this day her
thoughts are with the Hindoo women,
and especially the child-widows, whose
sufferings on account of the cruel na
tive customs have never ceased to be
sources of sympathetic suffering to the
gentle old hymn writer..
Mrs. Luke's two daughters died many
years ago. but she has a son and grand
children to comfort her declining years
and lives in her own pleasant home at
peace with all the world except the
British Government, for which her
prayers ascend that it, may mend its
evil ways and cease to impose taxes to
which no Congregational conscience
may submit.
Happily the forthcoming auction sale
of some of Mrs. Luke's household goods
to meet this hated tax is not likely to
be attended* by much persorfal discom
fort for her, for the rule at these sales
hitherto has been that friends and
sympathizers bid in the goods for the
exact money demanded by the Govern
ment and then restore the property to
the original owner. Many an American
would, I feel sure, bid many times its
value for some trifle from the home of
the author of one of the most famous
hymns in the language.
AMERICANS IN* LONDON*.
â Mrs. Claude Ponsonby, who was Miss
Horwirz of Baltimore, is receiving con
dolences from every one at the neces
sity which has compelled her to shut
up her delightful London house in
Queens Gate terrace to spend the win
ter in the Pyrenees. This is no less se
rious a matter than the ill health of
her little son Harold. Mr. and Mrs.
Ponsonby have taken a pretty little
villa at Po, though the place has for
them a very sad memory, for it was
there that they lost their other little
son of typhoid. It is at the house in
Queens Gate terrace that Mrs. Ponson
by keeps all the best of the works of art
collected by the late Hon. Ashley Pon
sonby, her father-in-law, and hfs father.
Lord de Mauley. The Ponsonbys al
ways have appointments at the British
court, Claude Ponsonby's cousin, Cap
tain Fritz Ponsonby, being now the
favorite equerry of KingEdward VII.
It is expected that while at Po Mrs.
Ponsonby will receive a visit from her
mother, Mrs. Horwitz, who lives at
Rome, having bought one of the glor
ious old palaces of the* Roman aris
tocracy, to which she has added mod
ern conveniences, including a . won
derful bathroom fitted up entirely with
pink marble. Mrs. Horwitz's eldest
daughter, who married an Italian
Count, also lives in Rome.
Mrs. Thomas B. : Bowring has just
returned from New York to her Lon
don home at 7 Palace Gate, having
curtailed her annual visit to her native
land to the great mystification of her
friends, especially as last year, being
the exception that proves the rule,

DurbaV instead of to the United States.
But the reason is that Mr. and Mrs.
Bowring wished to be in London at
the time of the marriage of their rich
kinsman, Victor Bowring, whose en
gagement to the widow of the late
Mr. Hanbury, Minister of Agriculture,
is being kept a close secret. It' was
only in June last that Mr. Hanbury
died. The marriage will take place
immediately after the settlement of
Eome law business arising from a dis
pute y with Mrs. Hanbury's relatives
over the reading of a certain part of
the late Minister's will. , v
Mr. Hanbury left $350,000 a year to
his wife for life, with a suggestion,
that she make certain dispositions of
the property the reading of which
might be, taken either as a desire ex
pressed or as an absolute testamentary
intention. This point has been dis
cussed once in the courts and decided
in Mrs. . Hanbury's favor, but Lady
Milman, Mrs. Hanbury's sister-in-law,
is. now appealing and the coming mar
riage is awaiting the. termination of
this appeal, as it would be annoying
to have the honeymoon broken Into
by law. One of Mr. Bowning's first
gifts to his prospective bride on their
engagement was a tiara of diamonds
and pear-shaped pearls, the pearls be
ing the very largest that, could be got
in London, and a "wonderful stom
acher of prodigious gems to match it.
Love' of these immense jewels must
run in'the family, for Victor Bowring's
mother, Mrs. Edgar Bowring, is noted <
for the. enormous pearls and stupen
dous diamonds that she wears.
Bowring is a well known figure "in
London society and is everywhere re
membered as being extremely tall.
He has a very young face and snow
white.' hair, the result of typhoid fe
ver, and because of this and his ex
treme height he is known as "Mont
Blanc." Like his cousin's American
wife, Mrs. Thomas B. Bowring, he Is

LONDON, Feb. 27.â Now that Lord
Donoughmore â son-in-law of .Michael
Grace, erstwhile of New York â has at
tained to a responsible position under
the Government as Under Secretary for
War, Battle Abbey, the historic house
purchased by Mr. Grace from the heir
of the late Duchess of Cleveland, will
be the scene during the next Parlia
mentary session of many interesting
week-end parties, when politics will be
a dominating feature. Lady Donough
more's ambitions in the interests of
her husband's political future are only
equaled by those of the Duchess of
Marlborough for her husband. In so
ciety circles it is well known that there
is some little competition between the
ladies on both sides. !
Lady Donoughmore is her husband's
most devoted assistant. Away fror.i
his office in the seclusion of his homo
she renders him material assistance
with his private correspondence. She
works on # the typewriter with a great
deal more^expertness than many a city
clerk, and in this way she relieves th-i
Under Secretary of much of the anx
iety of trusting Government secrets ;o
hired clerks. Outside Pall Mall she is
practically his private secretary, and
has become such a keen political stu
dent that her husband considers her
advice well worth having. Consider
ing the comparatively short time she
has been in England, it is asserted
that she knows more about English
politics than many English women who
have been political propagandists for
years. If he/ husband does not rise
to a high position in the service of the
country it will not be her fault.
STORY OF A BURGLARY.
Battle Abbey presented all the fea
tures of a fully equipped family man
sion when Michael Grace acquired it
some time ago for his English resi
dence. All the necessary legal docu
ments were signed, when he heard that
the mansion was the scene during the
latter days of the last century of one
of the most daring burglaries on rec
ord. Although he claims to be by no
means of a superstitious nature, hÂ»e
proceeded at once to the lawyers who
had charge of the sale and protested
that the whole history of the place
had not been disclosed to him. He re
ferred to the story of the burglary
when 550,000 worth of jewelry was
extracted from one of the rooms one
evening while the Duchess of Cleve
land was entertaining a distinguished
party at dinner. ( The fact that one of
the articles stolen on the occasion was
a famous necklace of diamonds and
rubies and emeralds which Queen Vic
toria had presented to the Duchess of
Cleveland was in itself sufficient to
prejudice Mr. Grace against the occu
pation of so insecure an establishment.
Before the new occupant could be
relieved of his anxiety. for the safety
of his valuables the parties interested
in the sale had to undertake that a #
strong room would be constructed
which would defy the attacks of the
most determined burglars. The new
addition to the famous residence i3
now nearing completion and In a few
weeks Mr. Grace will be able to dis
pense with the services of the London
safe deposit, which holds large quan
tities of his most valuable possessions
in plate and jewelry.
rORTEIlS HOUSE-HUNTING.
Robert P. Porter, who has been for
some time living in Oxford with his
wife and daughter, is In negotiation for
a house in London. One in Berkeley
square close to the Earl of Rosebery's
brtiutlful London residence first took
Mr. Porter's fancy, but so modern an
edifice was soon forgotten when he dis
covered a quaint little house which
some 200 years ago figured as one of
the pretty ( cottages in the little village
of Mayfair. This house is just off Park
lane and was part of the dowry to the
Grosvenor of that day when he mar
ried Miss Davies, a farmer's daughter.
Though at the time this marriage was
looked upon .almost as a mesalliance*
the property thus added to the Grosve
nor estates is now among the most
valuable in the whole of London.
Though this cottage of olden times ha3
probably received an additional story,
it still preserves the pretty wooden pan
elling which' is so decorative and which
is kept white, in the drawing-room at
least. Mr: Porter has another object
in negotiating for this house beside that
of making it his London residence. He
needs more room now for the beautiful
antique furniture he is so assiduously
collecting. His house at Oxford is al
ready crowded with the collection h?
has made since his arrival in England.
and he hopes to find a good deal more
within a short limit of time, so that
having lived with it for a certain period
It will be duty free when he returns to
the United States with the whole of kis

ty it was the many ladies and gentle
men who, on the night of the third

leap year ball given by Haven Circle

Mission Opera Hall. The ladles of the
circle had charge, and the manner
In which they took to "jail" those that
violated the leap year rules and those
that did not proved most conclusively
that when the ladies have the oppor
tunity they are ever ready to show
that they can rule. But as it was all
good-natured fun those of the sterner
sex who were the victims submitted
gracefully.

Instinctively- I had been to "The Old
Homestead" the night before â 1 put out
my hand to prevent Denrr.an Thomp
rc-n from walking into the elevator
vhaft as we went roofward at his hotel
rtif other day. It was all Mr. Thomp
son's fault. The apple-cheeked, blue
eyed old gentleman who met me in the
ILJtle reception iw>m arthe Palace was
Joshua Whiteomb to the life, and most
*f'us know how much the old hc-me
steader knows about elevators. Yet,
like Whiteomb. I sonn found that the
mild, wondering eyes of Mr. Thompson
are as shrewdly observant as they are
kind; thai the elevator is no more a
strange beast to him than to you and.
me.
..Withal, it is not for nothing that a
;man plays the same character for
twenty-nine years, as Denman Thomp
son has played Joshua Whiteomb. The
actor has preserved the same buoyant
interest in life as the old countryman;
his outlook has the same quaint, fresh,
shrewd sweetness; his cheek even the
sun-born rosiness of Whitcomb's â how
ever he has managed it. One wonders,
apropos, just what effect a twenty
.r.ine year course of "Ghosts," for ex
ample, would have had on the Oswald
<~>f the cast.
Mr. Thompson was for chatting in
the reception room, but I decided for
the palm-set veranda on the sixth floor,
at the instigation of my photographic
accomplice.
"Is it one of those little things you
sna*p?" the actor asked, as we informed
him of our pictorial intentions, "be
< a use I have refused to be photo
praphed so many times. And I don't
v.ant to hurt any one. Why, it is years
and years since I was photographed.
I couldn't go to any gallery, you know."
He was told that he would not have
to pese. that he need not be cognizant
f the proceedings at all. and that we
should be greatly favored if he would
simply permit the i hotographer within
snapping distance.
' Well I guess you have your living to
pet same as me," he put it Whitcombly,
"aÂ«d you ain't always got the choice of
how to git it. Come along, boy."
The "boy" and I came along, and
the next moment were among the
paffns of the top story.
â¦Wonderful place this." the old gen
tleman began, looking up at the big
girders of the glass roof. "Never been
beat. It was built just two years v hen
I came here first. They thought it a
darzlin' place then. 'Twas a wonder,
too â 'way out here so far from any
thing. Like the railroads. Those men
deserved all they got. They put every
bean they owned into the roads. Every
tifne I cross those deserts comin' out
hVre.I wonder more how they had the
(â rurage 10 lay those tracks."
"That's a long time ago, Mr. Thomp
son."
'I came here first in "78," the actor
supplied. "Been playin* Joshu-a for
twenty-nine years. Quite a record."
"He put up a proud finger hereâ that
looked curiously more used to the feel
of flour than of a hare's foot â then
went on: "I was in 'Joshua Whiteomb*
then. "The Old Homestead' is a sequel
play.'
'And before that, Mr. Thompson?"
"Oh. everything," the veteran player
replied. He has the gentle drawl of
Whiteomb, the quaint lift of the voice
'at the end of the sentence. "Yes. sir:
I could show you a playbill where I
played Uncle Tom In 1855. and Paddy
Myles in 'The Limerick Boy' at the
eod of the evening. Not to speak" â
â with a soft chuckle â "of dancinsr a
hornpipe between pieces'. â¢ â¢ â¢ And
I'll tell you in a minute who was in the
company with me. Just wait. I'll re
member soon."
The placid old face takes on a far
away look ax Mr. Thompson "remem
bers." I find later that to the actor
there" are just two kinds of people â
those that are living and those that are
dead. It is a little shivery- But he has
recalled his man. The actor's memory
if< indeed a truly notable one. His
gentle wrinkles deepen as he says.
Flapping the arm of the velvet couch
he Is seated upon:
""Jim Warwick's the man. He came to
Calfforny afterward, and represented
somewhere or other for a lone time in
the Legislature. He was 'J. H.' War
wick tnen, look you. But he was 'Jim'
when we were playing together. He's
living. Jim is a newspaper correspond
ent in Brooklyn. X. Y.. now. writina
under the nom de plume of 'Broad
brim.' You must know him. But I
tell you the scene between Henry Hop
kins and me in the play ain't a circum
stance* to when Jim and I get to
grether."
"Mr. Thompson, would you please
Jift yoyr hand again as you did a little
svhile apo?" this, rashly, from the art
ist.-
VNay. boy." Thompson smiled.
â¢' 'twarnt like me. Anybody seeing a
picture of me with those spreadeagle
waÂ« - 5 wouldn't know it. You know I'm
a quiet sorl of hoss. I try to Kit and
vvalk and talk perfectly naturally off
stage and on. And that's the thins:
about .plays â the fitness of things as
Colonel Ingersoll says. Gel a play to
puit you so that you can be yourself,
that you want to cry, and kick and
laugh, just when your character should.
And not too much of any* of 'em mostly.
That's my way."
'The people seem to like it," I invite
!<i Mr. Thompson's forsetfulness of the
artist'* suggestion. But the actor then
;;ood-naturedly sat still for a moment
in a xÂ»ose that he considered appro
priate. I remark then, '"They wanted
you out Â»n front last night."
"I was sorrv not to come out," the
..Id gentleman said. '"But I was never
much, of a hand for it. la fact, they
#)Id me I couldn't set out in front of
the curtain, and we had to change
scenes. No, lots of people can do that
kind of thing as well as they can act.
There was Sol Smith Russell and Ezra
Kendallâ oh. have you heard Ezra Ken-
dall? That fellow with his curtain
speeches makes me laugh till I can't sit
on my seat. It's a gift. I haven't it.
Still, when people try to pay you a
compliment by gettin' you out, you
don't want 'em to think you are un
grateful. Could you tell them it was
not my fault? 'Course, we're not there
just to be called out. But we all like
it. particularly the youngsters."
"And how old a youngster are you,
Mr. Thompson?* The veteran has the
same nride in his age as the beauty in
her youth. "Jefferson is older, is he
not ?"
"Jefferson" â without envy â "is six
years older than I am. He's 76. Splen
did man. Of cpurse, he's much older as
an actor than I am.' He came of a the
atrical family and went on the stage as
a child."
"You did not, Mr. Thompson?"
"No, sir, I was grown before, I went
on. I was behind my uncle's counter
when I got my chance. But I spoke
pieces at school, and used to take part
in all the exhibitions. Lord, don't I
remember my first theater? I could no
more sleep than nothing in the world
that night! It was a fairy piece, and
I dreamed of "it for days â " and the
â¢shimmer of the old dream glinted again
in the bright blue eyes.
"And then you wanted to be an
actor?"
"Perfectly infatuated," he put It.
"But I went to my uncle's store at
Lowell â I was born and raised in
Beech Woods, Pennsylvania, in a log
cabin; my father was one of the pio
neers out there â and went into busi
ness. Then one day there came to the
store an actor they called 'Yankee'
Locke. I'd seen him in a Yankee part
the night before. Well. I had to go
to the back of the store to laugh, he
was so funny in the play and so sober
off. But next time he came I asked
uncle to introduce me and I told him
I wanted to go on the stage. And he
got me on."
"That was inâ"
"Le's see â wait a moment, I'll tell
you. Oh. yes; I was 20 then â 1853."
"And you haven't had a farewell tour
yet?" '
"Nor intend to just yet if I feel as
well as I do now." the actor said
stoutly. Then he leaned forward to
whisper, and I wondered what was
coming. "I don't like to make any
one a storyteller, but I'll just tell you
that the report that this was my last
appearance was entirely unauthor
ized. One of the papers had it so."
"And you're still not tired of your
work?"
"Xo, sir. It's the last thing one
tires of if one likes it. And I like to
please people. So does everybody. So
do you, don't you? I tell you," the
mild old face looked as wise as a kind
old owl's here, "I tell you more men
have died of 'retiring* than of old age.
It's feeling that you are still of use
and consequence that keeps one alive.
I always think of Colonel of
the old Centennial Hotel. He'd made
a sight of money hotel keeping; didn't
need to work any more and he'd put
a manager in his place. But he used
to be around all the time. He had a
great way of going over the list of
new arrivals,- and one day the man
ager said to him, 'Why d'ye bother?
You don't need the money.' The col
onel said: 'You'll never make a hotel
keeper. I shall never be too rich to
care whether people consider my hotel
good enough to come back to after
they've been under my roof, nor too
old to try to make them come.' You
see. he had pride in his trade. * *
There's my uncle, too. .He was in the
fur business. He retired. But he has
a swing seat in the office just the
same. Sometimes the boys will make
a deal the old man doesn't approve â
he's always interferin', and one day
one of them suggested that he should
go to Orchard Beach for a week and
have a good time. He just screamed:
'A good time; why, I haven't a min
ute to spare!' And he really hadn't
a thing to do. We're all pretty much
like that when you come to think of
it. But I think he'd dte in a week if
they sent him home. All is vanity, but
a good hand at the curtain is a good
thing. I'm not retiring yet."
"Am I right in thinking 'The Old
Homstead* the oldest of the rural
dramas?"
"Yes," and the old gentleman proudly
added, "they call it the 'daddy of them
all' on the playbills in Boston. Things
have changed a hull lot since 'The Old
Homestead' started."
"We've changed a lot here?" I sug
gest.
"A trifle," he smiled. He lifted up
four fingers here and said: "There were
cmly four theaters here, I think, when
I first came. We played 'Joshua Whit
comb' for eight wepks then, at Billy
Emerson's Opera-house. That was '78.
I'll tell you in a minute who was at
the California then. Great days. Oh,
yes. John E. Owens was playing 'Solon
Shingle' then, and there were Tom
Keene, McCullough and Frank Banga
in the company. And at the ' Bush
Theater there wasâ now, I'll think in
a moment â Goodwin, sure enough, Nat
Goodwin. Billy Crane and George
Knight in 'Kvangeline.' The money
flew iÂ» those days, I tell you. It was
unlimited."-. â¢.
"There have been many changes hi
your company, too, Mr. Thompson."
"A sight," he said. "Chauncey Olcott
spoke his first lines with me, so did
Neil Burgess. Laura Burt was an
other beginner in my company. Your
own Tim Frawley played one of his
first parts with me. He showed lha
stuff even then. Yes, sir."
Then Mr. Thompson looked up at me
quizzically and said: "I think that
will be about all. Old folks get to talk
ing too much, when they get a good
listener â and sometimes when they
â don't. And it ain't always worth Us-.
tenin' to. Mostly not."
"But you haven't told me yet any
thing about 'The New Minister, 1 " I
demur, "your new play. IÂ« really want
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY. FEBRUARY 28, 1904.
to hear about it â cross my heart!"
Somehow the problem play got men
tioned here and Mr. Thompson sat
down again â he had risen from his seat
â to acknowledge that he did not wholly
like the problem play. Yet when I
suggested that to keep away from
problems is to keep away from life the
actor said: "Some people are certainly
benefited by seeing themselves in the
glass â trouble is they don't recognize
themselves. I do think, properly illus
trated, that the difficulties of living
are useful material. When George and
Mary see things happening to another
George and Mary on the stage it's apt
to set them thinking."
And then Mr. Thompson began to
talk. It is a pity that he also requested
my silence, as Is usual with people wh)
began to be really interesting. What
matters must be ignored, however, and
I fell in with the conspiracy of silence.
But Mr. Thompson has much to say
that is not in Joshua Whitcomb's phil
osophy. He has a curiously sage, un
conventional regard In some directions.
But then againâ
" 'The New Minister* is quite a hit
in the East, I see."
"Done very well," Thompson rejoined.
"You know Ryer and I wrote that to
gether, and I'm glad for his sake it
I? doing so well. He's dead. His widow
has the rights of It."
"We liked it here, Mr. Thompson."
"Oh, you saw it. And really liked it?
Well, there's a good many of my idea3
in that play."
"I recognize that."
"At the end of the second act "
"I remember It "
"No, you don't," Mr. Thompson
chuckled, "this end was cut out. They
thought it too much. There is a dona
tion party at the new minister'sâ you
know what they are, everybody brings
something, slippers or custards or
somethingâ and some one comes in
with a story of a poor fellow and his
family starving. Well, the orthodox
eld minister plumps on his knees and
says: 'I will give him my prayers.' The
other chap, the new minister, says:
"And I. my Dotatoes'â 'I mv ncrtatoes!'
Good day to you, I'll be seeing you
again before I go?"

Owen Wister, author of "The Vir

ing gallery the other day, when he hap
pened to be down that way. He is a
quiet-appearing young man, and the
Bowery sports, who had been watch-
Ing the attempts of unskillful custom
ers, were inclined to snicker when Mr.
Wister pulled off his left glove and
seized a revolver with that hand.
"Better take the right hand to It,
beau," observed a very tough-looking
mug, with a note of contempt In his
voice.
"Oh, I don't know," answered Wister,
quietly, as he put six bullets into the
space of a silver quarter on the target
twenty yards away. "I have always
been used to sh'ooting with either
hand. '
"B'chee. If he was a little taller, and
had'de whiskers on his chin, I should
think dat guy wuz Buffalo Bill." mut
tered the mug. as Wister walked away.

"Mary of Magdala," in which Mrs.
Fiske will be seen In this city, Is a
drama entirely worthy of this great
actress and her standing as the most
strongly individualised and most artis
tic player that the American stage can
boast. And this play has been pro
duced by Mrs. Fijke In a manner to
reflect the highest credit. -
More folk than one would Imagine
seem to find Sunday afternoon a good
time to enjoy chamber music, as wit
ness the attendance at the Kopta Quar
tet novelty concerts. It is true Lyric
Hall would hold more, but It could
hold by a keenly interested hundred
or so fewer people than gathered there
last Sunday. Perhaps of all kinds of
music chamber music is most fastidi
ous in its appeal. It invites only the
chosen. Only the few respond to Its
charm. And the resulting freema
sonry of Its audiences Is a fine and
pretty thins:. You may indeed at such
concerts be pretty sure you'd love your
neighbor if you knew him â without
he fiddled better than you â which
again he Is entirely likely to do!
I noticed a good many fellow fid
dlers enjoying Mr. Kopta and his con
freres last Sunday, Mr. Minetti, whose
own quartet is silent just at present,
among them. It seems that when one
brother of the bow. a little tired of the
hard work and small (material) re
ward of the string quartet work, drops
it another comes to lift it heroically
again. Mr. Kopta has already done
much service in this field, notably at
the afternoons given by Mrs. Hearst
last season to the students at the Uni
versity of California. Mr. Kopta's
own good fiddling is famous and his
associates are well known bowmen.
"Johnny" Joseph plays an individual
second fiddle; Charles Heinsen's viola
playing Is entirely reliable, if slightly
wanting in personality; and Adolph
Lada is a sympathetic and tasteful
'cellist. I have before expressed my
pleasure in Mrs. Oscar Mansfeldt's un
usually efficient pianlsm that makes
possible iuch feats as the quite remark
able performance of the "Marcia"*
(Schumann quintet, op. 44) last Sun
day, a firm and delicate bit of ensemble
work such as one seldom hears. It la
in such places that one becomes en
thusiastic over the future of the quar
tet. The "stuff" is surely there, and the
pleasure of watching its development
will be ours.
The attendance will, however, deter
mine the continuance or stoppage of the
series. In the meantime one more con
cert has been arranged for on Sunday.
March 13, at 3 o'clock. For novelty
the Richard Strauss piano quartet,
op. 13, will be given for the first time
here. Dvorak's string quartet, op. 96.
will also be played.
Whether Mr. Hartman'a engagin?
Deutsch, Signor Russo's fascinating
English, or Teddy Webb's imported
mustache, will prove the most seduc
tive asset of "The Gypsy Baron " at the
Tivoli this week remains to be seen. Nor
has the bloom faded from Signor Rus
so's courageous lingo. As for Web:Â» v 3
mustache, by the way in which the ac
complished little comedian stroked its
invisible bristles at rehearsal, it prom
ises to be the greatest thing in sight.
Johann Strauss' music, too, will be
there. One of the best of the famous
light operas of the "Waltz Kins." "The
Gypsy Baron" is as attractive to-'day
as when it first took Vienna by storm
in 18S3. The proportions of the work
are almost grand operatic, the finale
of the first act one of the finest in light
opera. By the promise of the rehearsals
the Tivoli's production to-morrow even
ing will be notably adequate. Perhaps
it will not be like that of Herr Con
ried, who produced the opera in Boston
in '8S with an orchestra of 110 men, and
principals and chorus In key. Still.
Conried's Deutscher papa was played
on that occasion by "Teddy" Hartman
â who said "sung?" It is a gross libel.
And Herr Conried did not have Signor
Russo. whose engag ment for the gypsy
baron's part is a distinct inspiration.
None familiar with TivnJi history will
forget the little I nor's lapses into
comic opera when the grandest was in
tended. Signor Russo has now a de
lightful opportunity to prove himself
the comedian that he was born. There
is again the competent Cunningham,
and of the women, Carro Roma as the
gypsy princess. Annie Myers. Miss
Deglow and Eugenia Barker. Seven
weeks' rehearsal has given the chorus
â one of the best and largest the Tlvoll
has owned â ample chance, and alto
gether "The Gypsy Baron" promises
excel'- rÂ» entertainment.
This week will see the introduction
here of one of the most distinguished
pianistic lights of the day In Harold
Bauer, who will be heard thrice in re
citals this week, on Tuesday and Thurs
day evenings and Saturday afternoon,
at Lyric Hall. It is a long season
since we have haft a pianist prophet to
preach to us, and from what I can
gather Mr. Bauer's planism goes.
Curiously he began as a wonder-child
violinist at the age of 9. But the piano
always allured and Paderewskl heard
him touching the keys one day with a
subtle sympathy that Impelled the
great Pole to advise him to desert the
violin for the piano. Bauer did so.
went to study with Paderewski In "92.
with the result of arousing now among
his critics a peculiarly vital admira
tion of his newer aft. It is to be hoped
that Manager Greenbaum's enterprise
In affording San Francisco the oppor
tunity to hear Mr. Bauer will meet
with the success It deserves. It can
safely be averred that Mr. Bauer will
be bravely worth hearing. Following

THE SMART SET MOBILIZED AT MONTEREY
What a hegira to Monterey! A local
rollcall of the smart set would resemble
a roster of swallows in winter. The
ponies! The men! The -women! The
s-port! The weather! Ah! What won
der the lads and lassies hied them
thither for rejuvenation "after the most
strenuous winter we have ever known.
The fine salt air and the inspiring
sport promises wonders to them â and
such a royal time.
Besides, here the men have a chance
to shine. What a hero is he who, play
jng a fast and furious game, is chucked
over his por.y's head, and falls pros
trate on the sodden field? Is there a
maid with soul so dead whose quicken
ing heart would not beat in rapture if
said heroâ on emerging from the hos
pital â would offer his battle-scarred
hand to her for keeps? If there be one,
trot her out, for she is not within the
range of the feminine folk I know.
Now. there's the irresistible Tom
Driscoll, handsome, debonair, and oh,
eo well supplied with ducats. When he
went down with his pony, every
woman's heart bent down with him.
And when he got up, up came the
hearts. Why. the least clever of us
could feel the rebound.
A polo player who is well up in the
running in popularity is the handsome
Parsee, Mr. Ezra. Likewise, the dash
ing Mr. Mackey. Walter Hobartâ
though hardly in this class, being wed
ded â is one of the lodestars of the
grounds, and for dash, daring and
deviltry is not excelled in the field.
How about the Britishers? Well, the
truth to tell, they lack the same quality
in their playing that their women lack
in dress â dash and individuality. Their
play is even, unscnsational and thought
ful, butâ your pardonâ not displaying
the Driscoll dash, nor, incidentally, the
Driscoll bruises. The Englishman is
â¢wisely careful of his ruddy epidermis â
hence his beautiful caution.
. . .
Among the dashing women who ap
plauded the efforts of the pony rid
c-rp were: Mrs. Frank Carolan, Miss
Umily Carolan, Mrs. Kittle. Miss Isabel
Kittle. Mrs. Harry Williams Poett, Mrs.
â Martcrt of Philadelphia, Miss Helen
Johnston of Chicago, Mrs. Emil Bru
puleYe. the Misses King, Miss Herrick,
Hiss Frances Howard, Miss Ethel
Dean. Miss Virginia Jolliffe, Miss Cora
Kirk of Chicago. Miss Celia Tobin, Mrs.
Charles Raoul Duval, Miss Charlotte
Russell. Mrs. Walter Hobart, the
ilisEee Parrott. Miss Langhorne and
the ever-gay Mrs. Peter Martin.
Some of these women wore gowns
that rivaled the morning robe of the
rose, bejeweled with dew.
Some pretty warm lorgnette duels
were fought on the hotel piazza,
ably seconded by the retainers of both
cides. The cause? Now, pray tell me,
who can tell the â¢cause of any woman's
quarrel â after first eliminating the
penus "rrran" from the question.
Women's "reasons" for "frappeing"
their vis-a-vis usually^ surpass my un
derstanding. "Jealousy?" Now, I didn't
say so, did I?".

gladly with forest boughs and ferns

was one long to be remembered.
Mrs. Masten wore a gown of rare

Behold Chicago! Itâ that is. smart
ChicagoVhas. become a literary, mecca.
Great speakers are flocking there, mu
sicians are opening studios there, and
behold, the society women are giving
musicales, parlor lectures and all sorts
of cultural stunts. It is said that the
only subject barred by common consent
from these drawing-room affairs is the
subject of zoology â because it will â dis
cussâpork.
The latest cultural craze there is
Griggsâ our own Professor Griggs of
Stanford. Here is what we read of
him and his work:
"The name of. Griggs has become
paramount in the land!
"In street cars â¢ it strikes the tym
panum from a far corner; at luncheons
it is the words -and thinkings of Griggs
that are praised and discussed, at din
ners it is 'Have you heard â¢ Griggs?'
and on the highway, 'I am hunting for
Griggs; where is he speaking to-day?'
I was a little prepared for this'epidemic
of Griggs as he struck New York last
winter, and the Griggs cult there raged
unabated all last season; people talked
of this brilliant young professor till
the subject got absolutely to be' a bore
and the men who hadn't heard him said
whenever, the hated war cry of Griggs
was sounded: , 'Dash, this Griggs; can't
W&' talk of s6me\?6dy v else to-night?'
"But Griggs wore well in New York.
His lectures continued to be the vogue
and people tore on about him all sum
mer, and possibly are tearing still.
. "Professor Edward Griggs cante out
of 'the West, even so far as Leland
Stanford University. He now lives in
Morristown. In the interim, I believe,
he has been abroad for years, in Italy
and Germany, studying. One of his lec
ture courses here this winter has been
on the great spiritual leaders, like St.
Francis and St. Augustine, and the
course at the Art Institute has been
on the Italian cities and early Italian
art, Ravenna and art of the sixth cen
tury being his subjects last Tuesday
afternoon in Fullerton Hall. These art
lectures are illustrated by stereopticon.
His talk at Mrs. Coonley Ward's Mon
day night was on Browning's ideals of
'manhood,' and to-morrow night in the
same drawing-room he speaks of
Browning's thoughts of 'womanhood/
and very beautiful are Griggs' own
Mf.rds on women. After hearing him
speak, witt> his marvelous, eloquence
and the incessant flow of ideas bearing
the stamp of newness, of originality,
the mind is so uplifted by the charm of
it all that when he ceases to speak
and other voices begin to tinkle round
about you it is as a poetical woman
expresses it. 'Like coming out of an
opera-house with your ears full of har
monics and hearing the clang of the
cable car and the harsh grating of car
riage wheels on the roadway.' '
"Griggs is young, light, slender,
smooth of face, long of hair, earnest,
sincere. Furthermore, he is married
and, still further,- there are four little
Griggnes at home in the family nest."
Nov. 1 ; we of the West discovered
Griggs. We learned of him when- Rev.
-inna B. Shaw discovered him years
ago, and pointed him out as the perfect
type of man. Therefore, is he not ours?
Albeit, we will lend him to Chicago
cheerfully, but we must meanwhile get
busy at home and do a\little along the

SEOUL, Feb. 27.â The vicinity of Pingyang or Ahju, in Nbrthern Kor^a, prpbably will bs the scene of the first engagement shortly. A large body of
Russians, with fifty-four guns and a swarm of cavalry, has reached Anju, sixty miles north of Pingyang,/ Other detachments of Russian soldiers are at
various places between Anju and fhe Yalu River. A force probably, totaling 50,000 men has now crossed into Northern Korea. The telegraph lines from
Pingyang to the north have been suddenly interrupted, indicating the presence of Russian scouts.

Open Switch at Luzon, Near Point Rich
mond, Causes Passenger Trains
to Come Together.
A head-on collision between two lim
ited trains on the Santa Fe road short
ly before midnight last night caused
the death of two engineers and* the se
rioue injury of a fireman. The trains
met at Luzon switch, a email siding
about six miles east of Pinole, between
the Pinole and Franklin tunnels. Chi
cago express No. 8, which left Point
Richmond at S:50 o'clock, had taken
the siding at Luzon to allow No. 3, the
California limited, which is due at
Point Richmond at 10 o'clock, to pass,
and the switch was left open through
the careiefsness of some one not known,
allowing No. 3. in charge of Engineer
L. L. Baker, to run in on the waiting
train. Engineer James Bennett, in
charge cf No. 8, knowing nothing of
his terrible danger, sat in his cab with
Fireman Edward Thomas, waiting for
the approaching California limited, to
paw.
As the headlight of the limited be
came visible around the curve En
gineer Bennett prepared to pull his
train out of the siding, when suddenly
the approaching locomotive swerved
onto the siding, and the next moment
the crash came.
BAKER'S BRAVE END.
Fireman Thomas saw the danger a
moment before the collision occurred,
for he tried to Jump from his engine
and almost succeeded in getting clear.
HÂ© vu caught in the wreckage, how
ever, and was seriously injured. Both
the engineers were instantly killed, and
from the position In which Baker's
body vas found he must have met
death In an ineffectual attempt to re
verse his engine to avert the impend
ing crash and save the sleeping pas
sengers in his train.
The California Limited passes Luzon
at a high rate of speed and the Impact
cf the collision reduced the locomotives
to scrap iron. It is a miracle that many
cf the passengers were not killed or
injured.
At the point where the collision oc
curred the road runs through a deep
cut, which winds around the base of the
hills and the engineer of a train going
in either direction can only see the
track a short distance ahead. No. 3
was running fast, as It was a few min
utes behind and Enginee/ Baker prob
ably never knew that the switch was
open until he felt his engine take the
elding.
PORTER THROWS SWITCH.
As far as is now known none of the
passengers were injured and the only
fatalities were those of the ill-fated
engineers.
When No. "8 took the siding at Luzon
the 6witch was thrown by Carl Taylor,
a Pullman j>orter, and it is supposed
that he nerlected to close it after the
train had taken the siding to await
the arrival of the west-bound. As the
place where th- accident happened is
remote from telephone and telegraph
centers and the collision occurred after
most of the country offices were closed
it was difficult for even the officials of
the road to learn any details of the
smash-up, but it is now known that
none of the passengers on either train
were killed, and It is believed that none
were injured.

America May Be Asked
to Mediate in the
Balkans.
ROME, -Feb. 27.â The situation in the
Balkans, with which Russia, Italy and
Austria are so closely connected, al
though it has apparently improved
somewhat during the last 5ew - days,
still . occasions much.'anxiety. ... It-.is*. no
longer a secret that Boris Sarafoff, the
Macedonian leader, came to Italy with
the principal object of deciding on a
course of action with Ricciotti Gari
baldi, who heretofore has not approved
of an isolated movement on the part of
the Macedonians.
In an interview the two leaders
agreed upon a plan which will result
in a general rising in the Balkans,
should necessity arise. With this ob
ject a meeting of all the Balkan lead
ers has been provisionally arranged to
take place in Venice about the end of
March. '"â¢ v â "â¢"â  ;';*'/â¢
The possibility. of arbitration also was
discussed by Sarafoff and Garibaldi.
The latter proposed to sound the United
States as to whether or/ not that coun^
try would be willing to' act in the ca
pacity of arbitrator.
Should arbitration or, the other sug
gested arrangements for peaceful set
tlement of the threatened trouble fail,
a general revolution seems inevitable
and Garibaldi is already secretly pre
paring a body of volunteers, each
member of which â¢will be equipped
with arms, 2000 rounds of cartridges
and food for a month. Garibaldi was
offered the general direction of the
Macedonian movement, but refused on
the ground that he thought' it better
to leave the leadership j to some men
directly interested in Macedonia, as
that would give him, Garibaldi,/ a
freer hand.
Confidential and official information
received her from Austria-^ points "to
the fact that that Government is mak
ing extensive preparations to- check
any movement on Its . southeast
ern frontiers, where reinforcements
amounting to 30,000 men have been
centered.
It is known that negotiations are
going on between Russia and Italy in
regard to the Balkans.
PARIS, Feb. 7.â An American j of
ficial who for two years past has been
studying the conditions in the Balkans
has Just arrived in Paris and to-day
made an interesting statement of the
situation. He said:
"I am satisfied Turkey will not de
clare war. She has been -informed by
the powers that even if she does en
gage in hostilities she will gain- abso
lutely no result therefrom and even
may suffer fr m a military occupation
by the powers, which probably would
result in the separation of Macedonia
from the Turkish Empire. It is true
that Turkey Is sending reinforcements
to Macedonia, but this is due to the
prospect of an outbreak of another in
surrection and possible interference on
the part of Bulgaria, now that Russia
Is occupied with Japan; but the Sultan
has everything to lose and little to
gain by a war, and if it comes you 1 may
depend upon it that" Bulgaria will be
the aggressor. .
"Should war come, I . am satisfied
that Bulgaria will be beaten. It -has
been said that Russia and Turkey" are
discussing the question of the passage

road between Liauyang, on the road
from Mukden to Port Arthur, and the
Yalu River, its front and flanks being
strongly supported. The right flank is
at Takushan and the left near the town
of Wiju. The Russian cavalry. crossed
the Yalu between Antung and Yon
gampho and occupied the road toward
Sukohon, and Cossack scouts advanced
along the greater and lesser caravan
routes. Scouts are now ten miles east
of Pingyang. The cavalry is thirty-five
miles north and the infantry 125 miles
northwest of Pingyang.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 27.â General
Kuropatkin and Admiral Makaroff
probably will not reach the seat of war
until three weeks from now, nor are.
the war operations on land likely to
commence until General Kuropatkin
has had time to thoroughly take in and
sum up the situation. There is a very
great probability that the Japanese
may avail themselves of the state of
unpreparedness In which the Russians
find themselves to hurry on their mili
tary operations. This Is, much feared
here. Dread of what nr.Ight.occur.un
der such circumstances hangs as a
nightmare over Russia's peace . of
mind, while all are hoping fervently
that the Japanese will stay their hand.
Russia is pushing her military prep
arations, tardy though they be, with
the utmost haste, but her single rail
way line (and not a very strongly laid
one) forbids an. enormous amount of
traffic being sent along. ' The line will

dome of the State capltol Sacramento
would appear to be located on the

â¢t Its back and .with a sea widening
to the very horizon to ttfe north, south
end west. Water in tremendous vol
ume Is coming*, down the Sacramento
arid -American rivers, which converge
at a point about' a mite north of the
city's \vharve9. The Sacramento is
fed farther up by the Yuba and
Feather rivers, while all the surging
mountain streams pour into the Ameri
can and contribute to make the Sac
ramento at this point a magnincenc
body of water, rushing on with a cur
rent as fast as a mill race. Some dis
tance above Sacramento the river finds
a measure of relief in the Yolo tult*
basin into which it has spread, inun
dating a considerable portion of Y/olo
County and beating like the waves of
the sea against the railroad embank
ment. So fierce is the flow in the basin
that one time to-day a portion of thÂ»
main track, near "Webster, was under
mined, and trains were stopped until
the road could be reballasted. The
water Is everywhere level with the
tracks, although. in. the. dry season they

The crevasse about two miles south

but while it might be thought that it

fact is that the river -has risen since

But Russia could not make such a con
cession, because she would thereby
forfeit the preferential position which
she and Austria hold In consequence
of having been designated by the
powers to act as their representatives
in dealing with the Balkan question.
Moreover, Russia understands that, if
ehe ceased to be a representative of the
powers, other powers would Intervene.
"But, granting that Russia may take
this risk and induce Turkey to permit
the passage of her fleet, this would be
a violation of the Berlin treaty, of
which Great Britain is a signatory
power. It would mean, furthermore,
that Turkey and Russia had entered
into an understanding which might be
interpreted as bringing into play the
Anglo-Japanese alliance. Aside from
this latter point, there hardly Is any
question that Russia -would find Brit
ish ships blocking the Suez Canal a'nd
the Straits of Gibraltar.
"Finally, the Black Sea fleet has been
greatly overrated. It was examined a
short time ago by an American naval
officer, who reported it not in very good
condition and that it was of no use for
over-sea operations, in consequence of
the small coal capacity of the vessels
composing It. These vessels had been
constructed simply for operations in
the Black Sea and not for service in
the Far East."

FANATICAL PATRIOTISM OF JAPANESE STIRS WONDER
Call's Special Correspondent Graphi
cally Describes Opening Scenes
f , f 1 \ T
of the War.
BY OSCAR KING DAVIS.
TOKIO, Feb. 9. â The war is on.
After more than twenty-one years of
negotiation with Russia about Korea
Japan has, in her own phrase, '.'taken
independent action" to safeguard what
she conceives to be her essential in
terests. Her navy has gone to sea
equipped and really' to meet the Rus
sian ships, and, if the best informa
tion obtainable can be relied upon,
with orfters to strike when they are
met. Her army is in motion. The
men who constitute the regular peace
force have either been- moved to the
points of concentration already in or
der to take transport for the scene Qf
land operations as soon as the navy
has cleared the way, or are now in
barracks at their various division
headquarters awaiting the order to
move out. Since Friday night, the 5th,
the men- of the first reserve* have been
swarming to the colors. Even now
more men are ready for active service
than Japan has use for immediately.
All this is what I wrote you ten
days ago would occur before that let
ter could cross the Pacific. That
prophecy has been fulfilled. But there
was another about which I cared
more. Throughout the strenuous dash
across the American continent to catch
the steamer which brought me to
Japan there lurked In the back of my
head the haunting fear that to miss
the connection at San Francisco was
not merely to have to, wait for the
next steamer, but something far more
â to miss one of the greatest stories of
the war, the answer of the Japanese
nation to the call of arms. I knew
something of Japanese emotionalism
and patriotism and I believed that
when the long period of uncertainty
was ended, when the severe nervous
strain of expectant waiting reached its
climax in the decision to fight, there
would be such a response from the
people as those who saw should never
forget. It was a natural but errone
ous attribution to the Japanese quali
ties dominant among ourselves.
Fancy what would occur in New York
the*day we began war with Russia!
Would the Stars and ' Stripes flaunt
from windows and roofs and flag poles?
Would crowds gather In the streets and
men cheer and bands play martial and
inspiriting music? Would signs of en
thusiasm and excitement be manifest
and many? And would the newspapers
be filled with details of the prepara
tions, the call for troops, their mob
ilization and movement, all the grand
rush and uprising of the people in an
swer to' the call?
NO SIGN' OF EXCITEMENT.
Well, I thought something of that
sort would happen here. There would
bo an extraordinary exhibition of the
public feeling, cheers, flags, martial
music and the display of popular ex
citement. But I was altogether wrong.
Spectacle it has been and most extraor
dinary, but quite the opposite of all
that I had fancied. Without noise or
clamor, without haste or show of ex*
citeraent. j calmly, quietly, with the
leisure of a picnic preparation, the re-'
sponse has been made to the summons
so* long awaited and so dearly desired-
More, it has been., attended . with a
secrecy that is astounding. The. nation
is at grips with the huge power which
fronts it on the west and north. The
people are proud and determined, glad
that it Is so and sure of themselves
and their cause, yet with their ships
at sea and their troops on the move
it was not until last evening that .they
received from their Government tha
first explanation of why they are going
to war or what they mean to win by
force that they could not get by peace
ful means. I doubt If the Government
of any other civilized people -on earth
could do what the Japanese Govern
ment has done and still retain a frag
ment of popular support. Yet almost
the only complaint heard against this
Government is that It has not acted be
fore. There is criticism from many
quarters that it is not a strong Gov
ernment, the Cabinet is not composed
of popular men and there is protest
that it has been weak and shilly-shally-
Ing in the face of the gravest crisis the
nation has known for many years, but
back of the Cabinet sit the five "Elder
Statesmen." and now that the decision
is to act there is .hardly a dissenting
voice.
To an American one of the most ex
traordinary phases of this extraordin
ary situation is the attitude of the'
newspapers. It is safe to say that there
is not one of them which has not in
formation which would make pages of
interesting reading. But they obey
the letter and the spirit of the law.
They not only do not print any news
about the movements of troops or ships,
or report any of the warlike prepara
tions that are seen now on every hand,
but they do not make even veiled ref
erences to. them; they do not hint or
suggest. They solemnly record the fact
that the five Genro statesmen and the
Cabinet have had a conference lasting
a certain time; that a Prime Minister
has had an audience with the Emperor;
that the Minister of War lunched with
the Minister of Marine, and that Is
all. Not a word or a hint as to what
occurred j at any of these interesting
sessions, although it must be said that,
in'most cases, they are as ignorant as
their readers as to what was discussed.
CALL TO THE COLORS.
It was on Friday evening, about 9
o'clock, that the order of mobilization
reached the men of the reserves. They
had until Sunday morning at 8 o'clock
to prepare, but by that time they must
be under way to join the colors. The
order for mobilization was ac
companied by an extraordinary tight
ening of the conditions of the censorate,
and an order was issued forbidding
the transmission of code telegrams ab
solutely in certain places and permit
ting them from the great seaport towns
only where the code books. were sub
mitted. 1 to the office for inspection and
the translation of the messages offered.
At the same time the Englishmen and
Americans who are officers in the
transport service received their march
ing orders, and the night train to
Kobe was filled withÂ» them, going
toward one or other of the military
bases. Before morning the word was
in every one's mouth that the reserves
had been called out, but the newspa
pers printed as calmly as ever the
oft-repeated guesses- about the Rus
sian reply, the time of Its delivery and
its probable character.
Saturday morning showed vacancies
among the employes of the business
houses, in the hotels, in the banks,
everywhere where young men had been
at work. The afternoon newspapers
printed a brief paragraph saying that
Baron Komura, the Minister of For
eign Affairs, had had a short confer
ence with Baron de Rosen, the Russian
Minister, and subsequently had been
received for a few minutes by. the Em
peror. Late in the afternoon a. man
came to me in the hotel and took me
aside to a dark corner, where one could
not see or be seen. In a mysterious
whisper, and with his ficger on his lips,
he said: / .
"Sh-h-h! The war is on."
But before that the reservists had
beeun to report at their gathering
points. At various places throughout
Tokio small signs had been hung out
setting forth the fact that they were
meeting points for soldiers. Men in
uniform began to collect about them
in little groups of six or a dozen. Here
and there their friends gathered also,
often many more in number than the
soldiers. They stood around and
laughed and Joked as if It were all
great fun, with no possibility of a more
serious side. .
Some of the newspapers began to
show embryotic symptoms of excite
ment and issued extras about the siza
of auction dodgers. These were hawked
through the streets by men who ran
about ringing little 'bells and going as
if their mission was to see ,who could
cover the greatest distance before night
without regard to the number of dodg
ers he disposed of. Some of them va
ried the performance by having two or
three bells in a bunch, and one fellow
had a string of themâ hand bells fas
tened together by a "-cord. He had
chosen them regardless of size and
their discordant clangor carried farther
than his cries.
DEPARTURE OF TROOPS.
All day on Sunday unusual activity
was evident in Tokio. There were
many persons in the streets, but all
were coming: or going and â¢ no crowd3
collected anywhere except about the
pates of the barracks, where the sol
diers were gathering. It was common
talk that during the night several troop
trains had moved out from the military
station, which is not the one regularly
used for passenger traffic. The men
coming in were to take the places in
the barracks vacated by those who
had gone and to wait there until their
turn came to go forward. It is the
general supposition that the main base
of the army will be at Hiroshima, down
on the Inland Sea, as it was during the
war with China. There the Emperor
is likely to establish his headquarters,
with the general staff, and about there
most of the troops will be concentrated.
From UJIna, a port near Hiroshima,
and from Moji and Shimonoseki, on the
famous straits of Shimonoseki, the main
embarkations of troops will probably
take place. The troops now moving
out are going to Hiroshima or into
camp near there, to await their time
to go aboard the transports.
During Sunday and yesterday the re
servists came In steadily. Now and
then there was a group of two or three,
but for the most part they came singly.
Each was in his uniform, and almost
every one. of them had a little bundle
containing his civilian clothing or
whatever it was that he wanted to take
along. But only on very rare occasions
did one of them carry his own bundle.
That was an office reserved for the.
friends who flocked with him. There is
no parading of the troops through the
streets here when they go to war, no
final march past their friends and
relatives who throng the streets and
cheer them on. no grand public leave
taking en masse. A different custom
prevails; The friends of the reservists
go with them to the barracks and at
the t big gate where all civilians are
shut out they: say good-by. If the sol
diec s has anything to carry they lug it
for" him. . Most of the men on Sunday
and -yesterday marched along stoically
at the head of their little processions,
now and then exchanging a Joking
â¢vvord with those who tagged after them.
Occasionally- one walked with two or
three friends and more formed a little
column behind him. Occasionally one
of the group carried a bamboo pole
from which flaunted a long streamer

SPECIAL. CORRESPONDENT
OF THE CALL AT THE
SCENE OF WAR.
bearing the name and address of the
soldier, with any particulars there
might be of previous valorous service.
There was never a sign of weeping or
of grief in it all. On the" contrary it
was a laughing. Joyous ceremony. Yet
there was a tremendous significance
about it. For neither the men nor
their friends believe that any of them
will come back. They count their lives
as forfeit to the empire, and they are
proud and glad of it. There is no need
of public display to 'stir up the en
thusiasm of these people. It Is already
stirred to a wonderful depth. My room
boy at the hotel disappeared on Satur
day afternoon. Yesterday I asked the
boy who took his place what had be
come of my boy.
"He gone see friend," was the reply.
"Is he a soldier?" I'asked.
"No," said the boy; "too old. His
friend soldier, he go say good-by. He
go Hokkaido. He come back two days."
LIKE THE FIXAL PARTING.
Hokkaido is a three days' Journey,
there and back, but my boy must say
good-by to his friend. Because the
friend Is not coming back from the war.
It is a last good-by, the end of the
friendship, and there is the same sanc
tity about this journey that there would
be about going to the actual funeral
of the friend.
So. they came in the little groups, and
the liveliest scene in all Tokio was at
the barracks gates, wnere now and
then the crowd neared 200 In number.
Surely, though these people . make no
outward show of their feeling and their
enthusiasm. It is none the less there,
deep and effective. Perhaps if it were
the policy, of the Government to pa
rade the troops through the streets and
to send them;away from the main rail
road stations in- the daytime there
would be large crowds to cheer them
on and to make public ado about their
going; but since the Government

pecting Never to Return to

chooses to send them away secretly,
to conceal its preparations with a care
that makes them almost furtive^ tne
people acquiesce without cc-mplain...
They make no public demonstration,
but they have thought long and deep
ly on what it all means. Their news
papers print scant information about
what is going on, but the people know
what the main question is and nave
made the quarrel theirs. There is no
question of hanging back amtmg them.
Wherever they meet they talk it over,
and the ricksha coolie will discuss the
situation quite as energetically as the
educated professional man, if not as
intelligently. And he has made up his
mind to the sacrifice that may be nec
essary just as much as his more for
tunate fellow citizen. Only the other
day in one of the little shops of Yoko
hama an American who speaks Japan
ese fluently overheard a group of, them
talking.
"It will cost a great lot of money,"
said one. tt
"Yes, and where is it coming from?
said another.
"The Government will look out for
that." was the comment of a third.
"We must all do what we can, I
suppose," said the first, "but If the
worst comes to worst we have many
things in the country that we can
sell. There is the great Daibutsi at
Kamakura and all the national art
treasures. We can always find a good
sale for them, and then after we have
whipped the Russians and have got
some of the cost of war back we can
buy them back again." ,
That they were all in sober earnest
showed only the more how determined
the Japanese are for this war. and
something of the sacrifice they will
make to carry it on. Collectively they
are a poor people, but they are as well
extraordinarily frugal. They are rich
in their capacity for saving, and this
war seems likely to prove It.
"THEY WILL NOT CO3IE BACK."
Down on* the road to Kamakura an
old woman, known to the foreigners
as "Oyster Mary," keeps the road
house that was kept there by her
father in the days when Perry came
to Tokio Bay. On Saturday afternoon
an American whom she has known for
years dropped in for a cup of tea.
"Yes," she said, as she brought the
tea to him. "the soldiers are getting
out at last. We are going to fight.
Just in this little road as far as the
next corner there are twelve. I know
them all. The order came last night
and they have until to-morrow morn
ing to say good-by to their friends.
I could not sleep last night for think
ing about them. It is very sad for
them and their friends, for they will
not come back. They have their
wives and their mothers, and I
thought about â¢ them all. and I am
very sorry for them. But after all they
are only one here and another there.
It Is not so much. But I was thinking
of the Emperor and what sorrow it
must be to him. for they are all his,
and I could not sleep all night for
thinking of how he must worry."
In the train coming up from Yoko
hama on Sunday afternoon the crowd
in one of the third-class carriages be
gan to talk about the war and of. the
calling out of the. reserves.
"Well," said one old woman, "I have
Just said good-by to my grandson. I
shall never see him again."
Two or three undertook to commiser
ate with her, and one said it was a
pity.
"Pity!" cried the old woman, "no
such thing! .Do not waste pity on mo.
I am only proud to have a grandson
to give to the Emperor. I know he
will not come back, but I warned him
rot to dare to die until he had killed
ten 'Russians or his soul would b
whipped back by the god of hall."
There is a firm 'in Yokohama wnicll
employs a great many Japanese, hav
ing agencies in various parts of tha
country. One of its men returned or.iy
a short time ago from hi3 year of s-r
vice with the colors, and is therefore
in the first reserve: The company
f LU nd him a place as soon as his time
was u2 as it had done for several
others who had been called out before.
Just the other day the Yokohama of
fice got a letter from him. It said that
he wrote on behalf, of himself and thres
of his mates who could not write Eng
lish. They desired to thank ths com
pany for its considerate treatment of
them and to express their regret at any
inconvenience which their going away
again might cause, but they expected
to be summoned to the colors again
very soon, and as this time it would
b* for war service they did not ex
pect to come back.
"But we are delighted." the letter
went on. "to have the opportunity ti
rtpresent the Emperor in his fight witn
his enemy."
FANATICAL ESPRIT DE CORPS.
There in a nutshell is the key to tha
extraordinary patriotism of the Japan
ese. It is the teaching of the Shintoism
that was their religion for hundreds ot
years. It is the tradition of the feud
alism that gave them the Samurai and
the Daimlos, who of their own will and
voluntarily gave up their great estates
to restore Isolated and retrograding
Japan to a place among the nations of
the world. If one wonders at the al
most fanatical esprit de corps of the
Japanese army he must remember that
it is still officered by the men who
made that memorable personal sacri
fice, and the men of the line have ever
before them the tradition of the sol
dier of the day when the flshtinff man
was In a class by himself, far ahead
of .his fellow who bargained or toiled
for a living, and it is their conceit now
to live up to the glory of that day.
Each soldier feels himself to be the in
dividual champion of the Emperor, the
personal representative of his sover
eign, and the call to the colors is an
opportunity greatly prized rather than
a sacrifice to be regretted.
So. considered as a show, the mobili
zation has been a disappointment.
Color, life, pageantry and blare of
bands th<ere has not been, but instead
an unlmaglned and unimaginable ex
hibition far more extraordinary. In all
Tokio I have seen but one Mae fiyinsr.
and that for only a brief time. Onlv
one cheer have I heard, at a railroad
station where a crowd of his townsmen
came down to see an old officer start
away. Here and there throughout the
city sub-depots were opened where va
rious articles of uniform or eaulpment
were issued to the reservists, in one:
place shoes, in another blouses, in an
other trousers, in another caps, and so
on. But not one of these places that I
saw was marked by a flag or other In
dication of martial character, except
that now and then the guard would be
lounging abont with Ihelr rifles leaninsr
against the bamboo racks set out in
front of the place.

of Baron Komura, the Foreign Min

ment that was immediately cabled out
in full. The same statement had al
ready been given to the diplomatic
representatives here of other govern

spective capitals. Copies in English
were given to the foreign correspond
ents, with the very significant remark
that the telegraph authorities had been
instructed to facilitate in ever,y way
the transmission of messages concern
ing the document. Thus at last Japan
made explanation of her cause. In
every free capital In the world the
statement is no doubt printed at length
this morning, if in fact it had not been
printed before. Here in Tokio it is
printed also, but without a word of
comment. In the newspaper that Is

there is no word of actual war in them,

by International agitation or external
complications.
An official said to-day that the new
Korean-Japanese treaty had been the
occasion for putting out a number of
reports calculated to foment discord
between France and Korea and perhaps
force the hand of -, France in relation
to other powers, particularly Russia.
The authorities had taken note that
the reports emanated from high.Jap
anese sources. But, the official de
clared, French policy was definitely
fixed to maintain neutrality and re
frain from the slightest active particle
pation in the war, and this would not
be changed by the Korean-Japanese
treaty or other events, so far as pos
sibly can be foreseen at present.
It is the understanding in govern
ment circles that Japan will not ask
the powers to give formal recognition
of the Korean-Japanese treaty, partic
ularly its Indirect establishment of a
protectorate. Korea's position is lik
ened to that of Roumania after tak
ing, advantage of the Turkish war to
declare its independence, but before
the Berlin Congress had sanctioned its
becoming a kingdom.
There Is no truth in the report, pub
lished in^i,ondon. and which origi
nated in the Novoe Krai of Port* Ar
thur, that the Japanese Minister at
Seoul, Korea, has requested the Korean
Government to hand the French Min
ister his passports. The Foreign Office
received a dispatch to-day from the
French representative at Seoul, who
does not allude to any such incident.
BERLIN, Feb. 27.â The silence of the
German press toward the war projects
itself upon the attention of any one
searching the newspapers here for an
opinion about it. The news agency
dispatches from abroad are printed
with occasional explanations of their
meaning to military and naval stu
dents, but that is all. The usually
opinionated editor has nothing to say
on the Japanese-Korean treaty con
cerning Russia's protest against this
alleged Infringement of Korea's neu
trality, whether the Kiel Canal may
be ussd by belligerents, or on Foreign
Secretary von Rlchthofen's statement
to the budget commission respecting
the continued occupation of Chill
province bv the troops of the powers.
The German newspapers on all sub
sidiary auestions growing out of the
war arc as mute a;;. they are on the
larger rights or wrongs of the com
batants.
This silence places In high relief the
relation of the press to the Govern
mentâa relation quite different from
that of the newspapers in any other
country on subjects of foreign policy.
The Government has given the press to
understand that neutrality in utterance
and reserve as complete as the Gov
ernment's own are a patriotic duty at
this time. The Foreign Office has the
conviction that the German press has
large powers for doing mischief In sup
plying material for illnatured foreign
commentators, and the Government de
sires to be perfectly free to act, should
action be desirable at a later period In
the developments of events, without
foreign feeling or that of either of the
belligerents having been excited
against Germany by injudicious com
ment. The editors are not restless,

HALES BELIEVES
0EIENT WAR WILL
LAST TWO YEARS
"Speaking deliberately and gravely,"
said A. J. Hales, the famous London
war correspondent, as he made his way
on board the China yesterday, bound
for the seat of war in the Orient, "I
consider that it will be at least two
years before we see the end of the
Russo-Japanese struggle. I want to
say right now that my sympathy is
fully with the Japanese and that I am
entirely antagonistic to the earth-hun
ger of Russia, but I am quite conscious
of the enormous Muscovite power, k I
â¢never thought the Russian fleet would
go out, but that it would merely hang
around Port Arthur.
"I expect the Japanese, who in dash
and method are very like the French,
to make a brilliant stand, but the
heavy, cold Russian is the more canny
of the two. The present procedure of
Russia is the same as she has always
followed, even in the time of the great
war god Napoleon, whose army she
toyed with and wrecked. Then again In
the Crimea at first It was thought that
Turkey would easily blot Russia off
the map, and the sequel for this easily
nursed optimism was a bitter lesson
for Turkey, France and England.
"I believe that Russia is* now playing
the same game with Japan. Presently
her forces will be concentrated, she will
fall back as far as jshe dare, draw Ja
pan Into extended marches and leave
the Mikado's men with the grown bur
den of guarding a greatly increased line
of communication.' Certainly Russia is
not showing her full hand at present.
She is dogged in purpose, great at the
finish of a fight and has never been
lacking in fine generals. should be
remembered, too, that Japan as a com
mercial nation suffersfsomethlng extra
in every moment of the war, while
with Russia, who lives within herself
and has hardly any commerce, the case
is quite different. Whether the vim and
spirit of the Japanese can cope with
the steady policy and endurance of the
Russians is a question yet to be an
swered.
"Speaking for my own particular
country, Australia, she cannot very
well do with Russian territory getting
closer to her shores. And that reminds
me of the Boer struggle, in. which my
compatriots got their first real knowl
edge of war. Well, the Australian of
ficerâand I mean New Zealand tooâ
may not be very dressy or effect-pro
ducing in peace, but in time of war'- as
a fighting animal he has no superior on
earth. When the Russo r Japanese cam
paign is over I: hope to sail from San
Francisco for New Zealand, from where
some years ago on the Alameda I made
the jolllest and most comfortable sea
trip of my life. No, I am not a stranger
to California; indeed, the scene of my
last story, "Angel Jim." is laid in Los
Angeles. Like Oan Francisco? Why.
sure.- Its'good fellowship' is great. All
are kindly received, > then treated on
their, merits, and if they have not got

IOWA'S GUNS
POORLY MADE
Board Investigating Acci
dent on Battleship Finds
They Were Once Rejected
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.-*In Its in
vestigation of the accident in which
the muzzles of the two 8-inch guns of
the battleship Iowa were recently
blown off the naval board, of which
Captain J. II. Dayton is the head, has
made some startling discoveries. It
fpund that the forgings from which
these two ill fated guns were built
were once rejected as defective by
Chief of Ordnance Captain W. T.
Sampson (afterward made admiral.)
The forgings were made either at
Midvale, Pa., or at the Bethlehem Steel
Works. They were sent to Washing
ton Navy Yard. Captain Jewell^vas
then the superintendent of the naval
gun factory. The forgings had a some
what unusual appearance. The metal
was marked by sand specks.
In 1 accordance with the policy of the
gun factory then, since and now in
force, Captain Jewell declined to pro
ceed with their manufacture, and a
board was ordered to Inspect the forg
ings. This was done, and a member of
the board now investigating the Iowa
accident is authority for the statement
that this board decided that sand specs
were not indicative of or due to weak
ness In forgings. The question then
became of how much sand specs should
be permitted In forgings. Captain
Sampson, it is stated, exercised his
disc -tion as chief of the Bureau of

OrC. u.nce to defeat the order that the
manufacture of the guns be proceeded
with, which was done. Nevertheless,
it is pointed out i.a remarkable that
these guns should be the only ones of
their caliber to display any weakness.
They did not explode at the same time.
With one round one of the guns had Its
muzzle blown off.
The captain of the Iowa then directed
that all the other S-inch guns on the
ship be fired with an equal charge of
powder. This was done, and then or
ders were given to fire the companion
to the already bursted gun. This round
resulted in a similar demolition of muz*
zles. -' â  .
The investigating board consists, be
sides Captain Dayton, of Commander
F. F. Fletcher and Lieutenant A. C.
Dreffenbach.
Rear Admiral Charles O'Neal, chief
of the Bureau of Ordnance, to-day took
exception to the statement that Ameri
can naval ordnance had less velocity
than that of the English. German and
French navies, and that a reduction of
velocity which he has ordered as a
temporary precaution before sending a
report of the investigating board would
materially impair the efficiency of the*
fleet. Admiral O'Neal said the muzzlo
velocities of suns on American war
ships compare most favorably with
those on other warships.

WAR WRITERS AND JAPANESE PATRIOTS
SAIL ON. LINER CHINA FOR THE ORIENT
Not since the early days of the
Fjianish-American war has the de
pnrture of an Orient-bound liner at
tracted quite the enthusiastic atten
tion accorded yesterday to the steam
ship China when she sailed for the
Orient. The big liner's decks were
trowded with all sorts and conditions
of interesting people. There were
v.hite men whose names are known
the world over by fiction and history
they have written, and little brown
men going to the Far East to help In
the making; of more history. There
was every shade of complexion from
the baby pink of Kicrrard Harding
Davis to the Colorado maduro of
Chief Steward Darling's assistant.
The majority of the liners passengers
arc bound for the Orient, all attracted
by the same mapnet â Japan's battle
with the bear. In about half a hun
dred cases the magnetic attraction
was in the form of patriotism. Fancy
salaries, love of adventure, hope of
glory and the call of duty were some
of the strings that drew others of that
interesting company.-
Of more than a hundred Japanese
passengers fifty are going home to en
ter their country's military service.
Among those was Dr. \V. M. Xaka
bayasi, who wore the uniform of a
â¢Japanese army surgeon and had sus
l-?nded by straps over his shoulders a
collection of leather cases said to con
tain everything necessary to equip a
field hospital, excapt crutches,
stretchers and an ambulance. Fifty
Japanese warriors sailed on the China
rnd ten times fifty stood on the dock
and cheered them on. The contingent
ashore displayed a Japanese flag. and
a banner on which was inscribed a
Kood-by message for the cheer of the
soldiers' fou!<=. An untuneful but en
thusiastic band played "Auld Lang
and other airs and Japs ashore
and on shipboard waved little Ameri
can and Japanese silk flags and shout
ed strangely sounding messages back
and forth.

ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 27.â After
having fasted the Czar drove this
mbrnlngr to the Anitchkoff Palace to
partake of the sacraments He was ac
companied by the Czarina and his
daughter Olga, who were "dressed in
white, in honor of the solemn occasion.
His Majesty was clad in full uniform.
The congregation included the Dowa
ger Empress, the Czar's sister, Grand
Duchess Olga, and her husband,: the
Duke of Oldenburg. His Majesty took
the consecrated bread and wine from
Court Chaplain Yanysheff and after
ward bestowed the bread, steeped, in
wine,, upon the Dowager Empress, the
Czarina and the Grand Duchess." The
rules'of the orthodox church forbid the
administration of the elements sepa
rately, except to men.
The customary mutual congratula
tions followed the partaking of the. sac
rament, and the Imperial party then
breakfasted In the Winter Palace.
Later in the day they dined at the
Anitchkoff Palace. The crowds along
the Nevsky prospect heartily cheered
their Majesties as they drove thrbugh
the streets.
There was a touching scene aitHe

when| Grand Duke Cyril, eldest son . of
the Grand. Duke Vladimir, the Czar's
uncle, left for the Far East. Grand
Duke Cyril returned to St. Petersburg
this morning, and went to take leave of
the Czar this, afternoon. He partook
of the sacrament in, the church at the

have signed the protocol for a treaty

independence and integrity of Korea.
No doubt is held -as to the approval of
Great Britain and the United States.
Belgian, French and German subjects;
as well as the representatives of com
panies conducted officially by Russians,
have been pressing for concessions
which may be affected by the altered
status of Japanese and Korean rela
tions. â 
PARIS. Feb. 27.â In explaining the
Japanese-Korean treaty Molono, the
Japanese Minister to France, said:
"My Government broke off relations
with Russia in order to safeguard the
independence and integrity of -Korea.
This treaty is a new affirmation of the
policy Japan has not ceased to pursue
at Seoul. The Independence oÂ£ Korea
is a guarantee of the security of Japan.
My country cannot without exposing
itself to suicide permit a third power
to occupy Korea. It is for us a ques
tion of life or death. We wish neither
to annex nor subject Korea, but we do
not wish Russia to incorporate the
country as she has Manchuria. The
statement that the treaty provides for
a Japanese protectorate is Imaginary."
AMERICANS
"SNUBBED"
IN RUSSIA
Treated as Foes of
. the Czar's Gov
ernment.
Proposed Gable Ex
tension Adds to
Bitterness.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 27.â The
Bourse Gazette to-day makes a Wash
ington dispatch, saying the United
States has undertaken to lay a 'sub
marine cable from the Philippine Isl
ands to Japan to prevent the latter's
isolation in case the Russians' cut the
Shanghai cable, the subject of a bitter
attack iipc-n the Government at Wash
ington "for this new evidence of its
breach of neutrality," claiming that
the contention of the United States
that the landing of the cable would be
undertaken for the improvement of
trade relations "does not clear Amer
ica's skirts," and inquiring "what the
Americans would say if Germany had
run a cable from Kiaochau to Port
Arthur of Vladivostok."
The news that the United States had
assented to the extension of the Pa
cific cable to Japan, with the reasons
assigned in the dispatches from Wash
ington, still further aggravated the pop
ular belief that the United States is
siding with Japan against Russia. The
few Americans in St. Petersburg havn
all remarked on the changed de
meanor of their Russian friends. For
merly they were treated with the
greatest cordiality, but now the Rus
sians greet them with the question:
"Is America our secret enemy and will
we have to fight her also before the
war corncc to an end?"
OLD FRIENDSHIPS SEVERED.
How deeply the Russians are wound
ed by the beliefâ destined, unless
checked, scon to become a conviction â
that America has spurned her old
friend and is now playing a hostile
role, is shown by this severance of
personalities, of which a striking in
stance'occurred this week in a promi
nent drawing-room, when the most in
timate Russian 'friend of an American
lady declined her proffered hand. Upon
the lady's exclamation of astonish,
ment. her friend broke into tears and
said she" f elf aggrieved at all Ameri
cans' since the reported action of the
commander of the United States gun
boat Vicksburg at Chemulpo. â¢â¢
The" attitude of the itnited States is
a subject of " constant discussion 1 even
"in the highest c'ii'ch's here,- where with,
'trie greatest fegfe't the " fear is ex
pressed that the two countries, with
out excuse so-far as Russia.., is. con
cerned, seem to be drifting apart. The
recently reported cancellation of Amet-'
lean contracts indicates how the re-:,
sentment of America's supposed hos
tility has invaded business affairs.
Popular feeling is, of course, to be.
largely attributed to* certain of the^
Russian newspapers, which have sud-!
denly turned their batteries from Great
Britain to the United States and Tiav.e
seized every rumor to place the worst,
possible interpretation upon its acts.
BITTERNESS OF THE PRESS.
Without waiting for an explanation
which, it is apparent from the dis
patches received here to-day from
Washington, will put another complex-,
ion upon the Vicksburg incident, the
columns of the press, for days past
have been full of* excited comment
based on the original version of the af
fair. In spite of the state of popular,
opinion the Government, it can be con
fidently asserted, places ' the highest
value on American friendship, and aj
though the course of American diplo
macy is at times privately viewed ask
ance, officially the Government of the
Czar assumes that the American atti
tude has been strictly correct, nor is
the slightest disposition to question its
acts manifested.
At the Foreign Office to-day the press
was informed that the Government
knew nothing officially of the Vicks
burg incident and that it had not in
structed Count Cassini, the Russian
Embassador at Washington, to ask for
an explanation. It was. however, said
to be possible that the Embassador had
courteously inquired as to the truth of
the .Vicksburg reports, without having
had specific Instructions.
Regarding the reports of the cable to
Japan the Government is also without
official advices and the impression left
with, the representative of the press,
after having spoken of thematter, was
that even if these were true, Russia
would not necessarily consider the
running of this cable a breach of neu
trality.
The pre'ss is authorized to say that
the Russian proclamation concerning
contraband of war will be issued In a
few days.
CABLE QUESTION UNDECIDED.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â It was an
nounced in dispatches from Washing
ton'on February 24 that the Commer
cial Cable Company. had addressed in
quiries to the Government as to wheth
er permission could be secured to land
on the island c-f Guam a cable connect
ing with Japan. This cable would con
nect at Guam with the Pacific Com
mercial cable to the United States. It
was said that the request was based
upon the. apprehension that, the exist
ing Japanese cables, both of which run
to Shanghai, might be cut during the
present hostilities, and Japan thus be
isolated from the world. In consider
ing the request the Government was
said to have reached* the conclusion
that an assent " wc/iild not involve, a
breach of neutrality, taking the ground
thaf a cable iÂ£ a commercial instru
ment, like a. mail ship.
;;WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â Most care
ful consideration is being given to the
application of 'ihe Commercial Cable
Company, made on behalf of Japan, to
land a cableon the island of Guam
toconnect at that point with the Amer
ican cable. Last evening the Presi
dent, Secretary Hay and Secretary Taft
had. a conference on the subject. As
heretofore indici-ted, the question of
the neutrality of this Government in

wealthy resident of this city, has truly created
a sensation among the medical fraternity. t>>
some mysterious law of nature he has done
â practically everything" but bring the dead to
life and doctors and scientists who have wit-
nessed his work are looking for him to do tn.s
next. In fact, they have been so taken ftacK
that they would not now bÂ« surprised at any-

treatment are but toys and tinsel us compared
with the wonder'ul discovery of this remark-
able- man. People say he possesses divine
power. Many of those who have been cured by
his mysterious power look on him as a K"a.
liut Prof. AdKln says: "No. I have no divine

me. I have jjlmply discovered a secret law of
nature which has been overlooked by r.octors
and scientists for centuries past. 1 believe
that anv man's life can be saved so. long as he

a. little more I shall be able to reigore life to
any one from dying, drowning or other causes
which do not destroy the vital organs, provided
decompocltlon has not yet In. I know these are
strong statements, bi't look at some of the
people I have cured. They were all but dead,
doctors said there was no hope, yet in many
cases I rid them of 3ctual disease in less time
than it takes to t*> tl you about It. There was
Mrs L. A. Phillips, of Trawlck. Tex., who
was the next thing tosdepd when I took hold
of'hcr case. Here is her letter: read what s=he

reporter was handed several letters from pa-'
tietrts among them that of Mrs. Phillips. T*iÂ»
following extract* are taken (word for word)
from some of the letttrs. Mrs. Phillips writes:
â¢â¢When I first began your treatment I had no

also suffered from falling cf the womb, ulcers

BERLIN, Feb. 27.â The German
press, which lost no time in pointing
out the growth of sympathy for Russia
in Central and Southern Europe, is no
less . eager to emphasize the bitterness
against the Anglo-Saxon countries now
prevalent in that country. There was
a tim*Â» not long ago when reference to
America always awoke a sympathetic
movement in the heart of Russians.
Popular imagination looked upon the
United States since Washington's time
as a natural adversary of Great Brit
ain, which country, since Emperor
Nicholas' attempt to win its friend
ship In 1S54 failed. It had been and still
la Russia's main political object to
overthrow. It has been left to events
immediately preceding the outbreak of
the present war to effect a change

a very lasting impression. One would
have to be blind and deaf to ignore the
violence and spontaneity of the out
burst against the whole Anglo-Saxon
race.
The Russian public will ever believe
that Japan, with all its self-confldcnco,
would not have dared to resist the
great white Czar had it not been for
the /British alliance. Even the think
ing people of the unofficial classes are
convinced that this treaty, if not th*
immediate cause of hostilities, had an
evil influence in Tokio. In the press
and in society the belief is general that
the Japanese would have thought twice
before entering a struggle of which the
end no one can foresee had they not
felt supported by the Russophobia evi
denced by every English and American
newspaper.
To sum up. it is thought, not only
among the people, but in Government
circles, that Japan is an open enemy
and the Anglo-Saxons are the secret
agitators.

ALEXIEFF DETAILS THE FIGHTING AT PORT ARTHUR;
GALLANTRY OF JAPANESE WHO EMULATED HOBSON
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 27.â The
Czar has received the following from
Viceroy Alexieff. dated Port Arthur.
February 26:
"After the moon had set early in
the morning of February 25," the Ret
vizan repelled several attacks by the
enemy's torpedo-boats, two of which
are believed to have been sunk in the
open sea. Our torpedo-boats, under
Captain of the First Rank Matuszvich
and Captain of the Second Rank
Prince Lieven. unsupported, encoun
tered and pursued the enemy's tor
pedo-boat flotilla. They sighted no
large warships.
"Later in the morning of February
25 the cruisers Bayan, Diana, Askold
and Novik v.ere sent out to prevent
the Japanese cruisers from pursuing a
portion of our returning torpedo-boat
flotilla. One of our torpedo-boats,
which was cut off by four Japanese
cruisers, sought shelter in Dove Bay.
It had no casualties.
"The Japanese fleet, on sighting our
cruisers, came in closer to the forts,
which, together with our warships,
opened fire at 10:50 o'clock. Our
cruisers, still firing, entered the har
bor, which our torpedo-boats had al
ready safely reached.
"The enemy's shells,- for the most
part, fell short. One seaman was
wounded, but we sustained no other
losses.
"The Japanese fleet consisted of
seventeen large warships and eight
torpedo-boats, whereas the squadron
which attempted to block the entrance
to Port Arthur on the previous day
had twelve torpedo-boats."
SHEIiLS FAIiL. IN FORTRESS.
The Port Arthur correspondent of
the Rues telegraphs as follows:
"On the morning of February 25 a
Japanese squadron consisting of six
battleships and four light cruisers ap
peared on the horizon. The Russian
cruisers Askold. Bayan and Novik
were in the outer harbor. The Jap
anese ships, upon attaining a position
within thirty-five cable lengths (about
four and a quarter miles) of the Rus
sian ships opened an attack. At this
time two of our torpedo-boats were re
turning to our ships from Pigeon Bay.
All the Japanese cruisers attempted
to cut them off. Nevertheless one of
the torpedo-boats succeeded in reach
ing Port Arthur, while the other turn
ed back. The scene of .the battle was
thus cut in two, the Japanese battle
ships cannonading the Askold, Bayan
and Xovik. which were supported by
the batteries, and the cruisers pur
suing the Russian torpedo-boat, which
entered Pigeon Bay.
'â¢The cannonade lasted forty min
utes, ard several shells fell at various
points in the fortress. One Chinese
was mortally wounded by a splinter
and another by a shell.
"In yesterday's affair the maneuvers
of the Japanese appeared to be defect
ive. While turning back to sea the
Japanese battleships got bunched, and
our ships did not fall to take advan
tage of this fact. They opened a run
ning fire, and one could plainly see
shells bursting amid the tremendous
target. This clumsy maneuver on the
part of the Japanese is considered as
affording weighty reasons for the be
lief that the enemy's losses were
heavy.
"A Jnpanese torpedo-boat lies on a
bank of? Port White Wolf. It is ap
parently one of those which partici
pated in the night attack with the
freighters."
TROOP CARS FOR SIBERIA.
Two thousand cars from the Russian
European system especially fitted for
the transportation of troops are being
sent to the Siberian line.
Alexandrovsky, who is to take
charge of the Red Cross field work in
the Far East, left for the front to
day.
The Xovoe Vremya says the Slav
pro-Russian demonstrations indicate
the willingness of the Slavs to come
under the Russian standard, adding:
"Their hesitation would finally be
overcome if Russia would be less un
compromising on the questions of or
thodoxy and autocracy, as the Slavs
enjoy constitutional government and
in many cases do not belong to the
Greek church."
The Xovoe Vremya herpes the pan-
Slavist Union will settle the near
East question once for all in favor of
Russia's aspirations.
Prince Arsene Kiirageorgevitch
(brother of the King of Seryia) has
been gazetted a captain of trans-
Baikal Cossacks.
The desperate manner in which the
Japanese are returning to the attack
in Port Arthur, in spite of their re
pealed repulses, has convinced the
military authorities that their main
objective for the present is to hope
lessly cripple the Russian fleet, in or
j d<?r to secure absolute freedom in the
disembarkation of troox>s. For this
reason the Russian commander " is
carefully guarding against exposing
his ships, keeping them in the harbor
under the guns of the fortifications..
A doubt exists as to whether^. the
Japanese really design to land near
; Port Arthur, and invest the city. The
I authorities admit that they are con
siderably mystified, but the prevailing
opinion seems to be that the Japanese
will not hazard a landing at this stage
â ot the campaign.
POOR LANDING PLACES. '";
It is pointed out that owing to the
conformation of the shores the only
suitable landing places near Port Ar>
thur are well within the range of the
batteries, and that if a landing is at
tempted on the northern part of the
peninsula the Japanese transports will
be unable to come to land, and that. on
account of the shelving shore the troops
would^ have to march miles through
mud and low water exposed to a gall
ing off-shore fire.
The Ministry of Finance, it is said,
has .again declined firmly the offers of 'â 
several groups of leading foreign banks
to float a Russian loan on the ground
that there is no need for adopting such
a course.
According to a telegram received
from the commander of the Russian
cruiser Askold at Port Arthur all ru
mors regarding th'e sinking of his ves
sel are false. The commander adds
that the Askold is quite sound.

AMBBICAN CONSUL
WILL NOT PROCEED
TO DALNY AT ONCE
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â The ,or
ders of Edward V. Morgan, appointed
and confirmed as American Consul at
Dalny, to proceed to that post have
been suspended. Morgan will not pro
ceed until he has received further or
ders from the department: There is
no present intention of trying to force
Morgan upon the Russian Govern
ment.
The State Department recognizes
the right of any Government to with
hold an exequatur, by warrant of
which the Consul is authorized to exer
cise his functions, and if another
Government does not feel that a Con
sul located in one of its ports facili
tates commerce there is no disposition
to make an issue on that point.
No change has been made in the or
ders to Cheshire and Davidson, who
have been named as Consuls at Muk
den and Antung, respectively, and are
about to sail in a day or two from
San Francisco for the East.
MURAVIEFF'S SPEECH
AT THE HAGUE STIRS
THE IRE OF JAPAN
THE HAGUE, Feb. 27.â Mitsuhashi
Noboukata, the Japanese Minister here,
has been instructed by his Government
to lodge a protest with the president
of the council of the permanent court
of arbitration against hte language
used by Muravieff, president of'the ar
bitration tribunal and Russian Minister
of Justice, in a speech he made after
announcing the tribunal's decision in
favor of the blockading powers as
against Venezuela.
It is expected in diplomatic circles
that the only result of the Japanese
protest will be that a copy of the com
plaint will be sent to the powers repre
sented before the arbitration tribunal.
Mura.vieff in the course of his re
marks said the findings of the tribunal
had been reached after a most minute
and most impartial investigation.. Like
all human acts, the decision was sus
ceptible of criticism, but now that it
was made every one should accept it.
The arbitration, begun in times of
peace, had ended amid the sinister acts
of war, which was a terrible obstacle
in the path of light and progress. In

spite of all good will, alas, no one was
secure against an unexpected hostile
attack. A nation was obliged to accept
a war when the legitimate defense" of
honor and liberty was involved. The
just providence which ruled over bat
tles would distinguish between right
and unfounded pretensions. At the end
of this war between a European and
an Asiatic people the right, he con
cluded, would shine out afresh.
JAPANESE OFFICERS
AND SAILORS. REACH
CHEFU IN OPEN BOAT
CHEFU, Feb. 27. â Several Japanese
officers and sailors who landed here
from an open boat early to-day re
fused to give any information \ as to
where they came from. At the Japanese
consulate It was given out that they
belonged to a gunboat which was dam
aged during the fight off Port Arthur
and which -sank trying to reach this
port. _
The statement that they were, mem
bers of the crews of the merchant
steamships sunk near the entrance of
Port Arthur during the attempt to
blockade the channel and that they
were not picked up by the torpedo
boats was positively denied. They
crossed the gulf in the open boat in
which they arrived. The Consul
claimed that he had been expecting
the arrival of survivors of the action
off Port Arthur.
CRUISER VICKSBURG
GAVE AID TO CREW
OF THE VARIAG
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27. â The text
of the message to the Navy Depart
ment from Commander Marshall of
the Vicksburg is as follows:
"Took the initiative by sending med
ical assistance to the Variag as soon as
possible after learning that they were
abandoning the vessel. Sent four
boats and assisted taking off the Rus
sian sailors, putting them on board
the British and Italian vessels. The
Variag remained afloat over five hours,
filling slowly. Our boats were in
structed not to bring the Russian sail
ors to the Vicksburg, offering the
Zafiro temporarily, but the offer was
declined."
Russians Search British Steamship.
ISLAND OF PERIM. Red Sea, Feb.
27. â The British steamship Benalder
(Captain. Mclntosh), which sailed from
London on February 6 for Yokohama,
passed here this afternoon and^ sig
naled that she was- stopped and
searched by a Russian" warship in'Jttie
Red Sea.
â¢ TOKIO, Feb. 27. â The official report
of the naval officers who attempted to
block the entrance to the harbor of
Port Arthur on the morning of Febru
ary 24 differs in s6me"respects from
the accounts already printed. . From
this report it appears that'the Russian
searchlights discovered the approach
of the five Japanese steamships before
they had reached the point where it
was proposed to sink them and that
the Russian guns disabled three of the
five.* Another new feature is that a
portion of the crews of the sunken
steamships were, not picked up until
the afternoon of the 24th. The report
of the officers in substance is as fol
lows:
Five vessels intended to obstruct the
entrance to Port Arthur advanced
about 4 o'clock on the morning of the
24th from the southward through the
Lao Thie Shan channel toward the
mouth of the port. It appears that
the Tenshin Maru, which was in the
van, was steered too far to port, and
when she was about three miles to the
southwest of shore was hit and se
riously damaged. She was run on the
shoals intentionally.
The other steamships, which were in
her wake, changed their course to the
northeast and advanced, but the ene
my's searchlights flashing upon them
impeded their progress.
SECOND VESSEL. DISABLED.
The enemy's fire first struck the
steering gear of the Bushiu Maru, dis
abling her. She grounded near the
Tenshin Maru and after striking her
officers destroyed her and she sank.
Next the Buyo Maru was . seriously
damaged by the enemy's shells and she
sank before reaching the harbor en
trance.
In the meanwhile the Hokoku Maru
and the Jinsen Maru had advanced
with great energy and had reached the
entrance to the harbor with consid
erable difficulty. The Hokoku Maru
was on the outer side of the stranded
Russian battleship Retvizan and the
Jinsen Maru on the eastern side of the
Retvizan. The crews of each lighted
explosives to destroy the merchant
man, and after giving loud cheers got
into their small b6ats.
When they found their vessels sink
ing the crews "endeavored to row to
the Japanese torpedo boats, ' which
were ready to pick them up, but the
Russian searchlights lit up their path
and the Russian fire became very se
vere. The crews in their small boats
were compelled to row around under
cover and they were unable to reach
the torpedo boats. â¢
The sea became heavier at sunrise
and 1 the- crews suffered great hard
ship. They finally succeeded in reach
ing the Japanese squadron at 3 o'clock
in the afternoon of the same day.

STOCKTON" IS STILL. SAFE
Xo Immediate Danger of City Being
Hooded Is Anticipated. â¢
STOCKTON, Feb. 27.â It is not be
lieved late to-night that this city
stands in any immediate danger from
flooding. While the San Joaquin River
and thÂ» channels Jn and about Stock
ton are running bank full and very
near to the danger point, It is thought
that there will be a slight fall, by
morning unless an unexpected amount
of water should come out of the foot
hills. - In the mountains east of this
city the rain has been very heavy., A
full two inches "of water â  fell
at Sonora last night. The storm
softened the Sierra Railroad's
roadbed in several places and
to avoid every possible accident no
trains were run over the Angels
branch to-day. The Calaveras River
and Mormon Slough are reported to be
rising above Linden, but in this city
Mormon Slough was falling slowly and
running sluggish.
Owners of reclaimed lands on the
islands are naturally in a state of agi
tation, but so far no reports have come
of broken levees, but at several points
danger is being guarded against by
strengthening the embankments. The
Mokelumne is stilh booming and Is
flooding the northern part of the coun
ty, but it is now thought that the
highest point has been reached.
Although showers have been fre
quent during the last few days the
rain was so light that the total for
Thursday and Friday, and up to this
morning, amounted to only .36 of an
inch. At S:30 a. m. to-day the total
for the month was 4.02 and for the sea
son to date 8.40 as against 6.84 for thÂ«
corresponding period last season. It
is the rains in the mountains that ren
der the situation uncertain. Their full
force is sometimes not felt here till
forty-eight hours after the storm. The
San Joaquin is carrying the volume
well so far', and while this continues
there is no danger of backwater, in
Stockton channels. To-night all of the
streams in the city have full two and a
half feet or more between them and
the street grades.'
HEAVY RAI.V AT BAKERSFIELD.
Farmers and Stockmen Are Rejoicing
and Outlook Is Excellent.
BAKERSFIELD, Feb. 27. â The
hardest downpour of the season visited
Bakersneld and Kern County this af
ternoon. A slight shower came early
this morning, just enough to wet the
ground. At 2, o'clock it began to rain
hard and continued all the afternoon
and evening. At this writing the out
look is that it will continue all or, the
greater part of the night. The rain
Is general throughout the county. In
this city about an inch of rain has
fallen.
The rain will be of the greatest
benefit to farmers and stockmen. The
outlook 'for these interests is now ex
cellent. The ditches are full and there
is plenty of snow in the mountains to
Insure water for irrigation purposes.
Two Inches of Rain at Fresno.
FRESNO. Feb. 27.â The finest rain
of the season has visited this section
during the past twenty-four hours and
the farmers and fruit growers can
truly be. said to be jubilant. Light
showers fell during the early part of
last night and about midnight a steady
downpour began, continuing through
out the night and all day to-day, and
at this hour, 10:30 p." m., shows no
sign of abating. It is just the kind of
a storm needed to, do the country the
most good, .. a".warm. slow r constant
drizzle that Js soaking up the ground
thoroughly. The fall so far la 1.7
Inches and Is very likely to be 2
Inches before it ceases. Reports from
all over the county are that the down
pour has been^very timely and has
guaranteed fine crops from the grain

RICH LANDS
ARE SWEPT
BY FLOODS
Continued from Page 21, Column 7.
Interference with railroad travel for
some days at least. Considerable
damage has been done below the dis
trict affected by the Edwards crevasse
by a break In a cross levee, letting the
water in upon probably 3000 acres of
reclaimed vegetable and fruit land.
In Reclamation District 535, where
the Edwards break occurred, the prin
cipal lands flooded are those of J. H.
and G. W. Cox, the Rancho del Rio,
owned by N. D. Rideout and others,
A. A., R. H. and R. Merkley, O. O.
Lovdal, L. U. Lincoln, C. Taft, E. R.
Edwards, H. Casey, B. W. Cavanaugh,
D. Flint and the Farmers* and Mechan
ics' Bank. '
In Reclamtion District 673, below
Oak Hill, the lands flooded by the cross
levee break include the property, of
Marlon J. Donnellan, Minnie Flint, J.
Sibley, J. F. Brown, the Sacramento
Transportation Company, f M. F. Sil
verla, Mary A. Nevis, Vehmeyer
Brothers, C. Baumgartel and numerous
others, mostly Portuguese.
KEEP WATCH OX THE LEVEE.
Coliisa Residents Are Guarding
Against Possible Break.
COLUSA, Feb. 21. â The Sacramen
to River at this place reached its
highest mark at midnight Friday,
when the gauge registered 27 feet
9% inches, the highest record pre
viously being February 28, 1891, when
It registered 27 feet 8% Inches. Much
uneasiness was felt at Colusa and all
along the river for miles as the water
gradually climbed higher and higher.
At the grangers' warehouse just below
town the water commenced to roll
over the levee top in several places
and a gang of men were immediately
put to work. They raised the low
places by using hundreds of earth
filled sacks. It Is estimated that fully
200 men patrolled the levee between
Colusa and Sycamore, a distance of
six miles, Friday night and this patrol
will be kept up until all danger is
passed.
On the east side, ten miles below
Colusa, three large and damaging
breaks occurred, the worst of which
was on Dr. Jacobs' place, from which
the water is rushing into district 70.
It is estimated that 300 acres of the
most choice Sutter County farming
land â will be flooded.
Another large break occurred about
3 o'clock this morning on the Doty
place, two miles below Meridian, and
still another on the Sills place on the
Sutter County side, below Grimes.
These breaks relieved the strain on
the west' side and the farmers, whose
hopes ' were .nearly gone, are again
taking, courage and watching the weak
places with renewed energy.
Word reached. Colusa that James
Bradley has lost eighteen head of cat
tle and a few sheep, .. C. V. . Griffith
has sixteen head oÂ£ cattle back in tho
Tuba bottpms somewhere thatag yet
have not been located. M. C. Lazier
has fifty head of cattle, and it is said
sixteen horses, wandering around in
the bottoms, provided they have not
succumbed to the flood.
The levee on the ranch of the late
Senator Boggs, fourteen miles above
Colusa, is In a very dangerous condi
tion. Part of it has been carried
away and a large force of men are tit
work building a cofferdam of sacks
and dirt around the break. On an
other part of this ranch there were
sixteen leaks within half a mile, most
ly caused by gophers.
The backwater from the Feather
River reached to within a few miles
of Princeton and- covered the farms
of Messrs. Steele, Armstrong and Mc-
Connell. Many families were com
pelled to move away from their flood
ed homes, leaving their stock on the
levee tops. Across the river from Co
lusa more than fifty head of horsea
and cattle can be seen On the levees,
â¢vyith the water only a few feet from
the top on either side. Several horses
and a number of sheep and hogs have
already perished in the floods , and
should the high water continue a few
days more the loss of stock will be
considerable. The farmers along the

AX UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
Has it ever been your unhappy lot to
be told by your physician that you
must go to a hospital to submit to an
operation? It bo, you remember with
what dread and shrinking you awaited
the day when you must endure the
knife. â¢ -
The present day surgeon appears to
bfi possessed by .a mania for operating,
especially In cases of hemorrhoids or
piles, and while the greater number of
the profession do not recommend this
"last resort" unless they honestly be-
lieve it necessary, the fact remains
that much needless operating Is done,
and the patient put to much expense
and sufferingâ for what?
To obtain a possible temporary re-
lief; these words are used advisedly,
because In nine cases out of ten the
affliction' returns and the patient is
Just where he started from. Oftentimes
he could be cured much more simply
and easily by the use of such a remedy
as the Pyramid Pile Cure: this has
come to be recognized as the best rem-
edy on the market for the painful dis-
ease namtd. and the druggists now eel!
more of it than all ether pile remedies
combined. ', . Â»
The writer personally knows people
who were afflicted with the worst form
of bleeding and protruding piles and
who were permanently cured by thÂ«
use of Pyramid Pile Cure. In every one.
of these cases the attending physician
had assured the sufferer that only by
an operation could. he rid* himself of
the disease: so much for the infallibil-
ity of the doctors.
' This remedy, which is sold by all
druggists at the low price of "fifty
cents, is in suppository form, is applied
directly to the parts affected, and per-
forms its' work Quietly- and painlessly.

MAKYSVILLE ESCAPES FLOOD.
Levees Protect City, but Surrounding
Territory Suffers Some Damage.
MARYSVILLE, Feb. 27.â While the
weather has hot exactly cleared, " no
rain has fallen to-day, and the Yuba
and Feather rivers are receding' rap
idly. The prospects to-night are for
clear weather, and the storm that has
raged for the past week with unabated
fury is thought to have spent itself.
With the reoedins waters business
has again rounded into form arid the
city of Marysvtllc has regained its
tranquil appearance. The alarm that
was felt when the flood water was at
its height has disappeared, and it is
proven that the city levee system Is one
of the' finest in the State. With the
water falling in the rivers the over
flowed lands' to' the north and south are
drained and in a few days will be high
and dry. It- is not .believed that the
land covered will be damaged to any
great extent, and in some , places the
overflow will prove of benefit.
Travel by wagon roads from all dis
tricts will be resumed in a- few days.
Train service over the mafn Oregon and
California line has been renewed. The
Orovllle branch line and the Knights
Landing road are still inundated. Re
ports from the neighborhood of Meri
dian, Sutter County, on- the Sacra,mento
River, say that three breaks have oc
curred in the levee soil th of that place
and much valuable land has been sub
merged. The damage to fridges is re
ported heavy. A large portion of Dis
trict No. 70 is flooded, and the condition
around Tudor has not Improved. The
water in the Tule is reported higher
: than ever before. Travel between this
city and Yuba City has been resumed,
although the street cars are not yet
creasing over. .Considerable water is
Ho>yinR through the breaks in the Linda
levee from the Yuba, and it will be
some time before it is repaired.
Most of the damage in Yuba County
has occurred in this section, and it is
impossible to estimate the amount. Thc
Yuba to-rilght registers seventeen feet
and is falling, as is also the Feather.
Some damage is reported from the
dredger site on the Yuba, and the work
of construction has been greatly de
layed. Stages out of this city are again
leaving on 'schedule time.' The rainfall
amounted only to about five inches
here, and to farmers outside of the
flooded area was very beneficial, in
suring, a bountiful harvest.
MONTEREY COUNTY REJOICES.
Present Rainstorm Gives an Assur
ance of Plentiful Crops.
SALINAS. Feb. 27. â The rain
fall of- the last tv/enty-four hours
has been of inestimable value
to "all parts of: Monterey Coun
ty. IJn sections of the Salinas
.Valley where^. ten. days. ago.* the farm
ers spoke hesitatingly of tn'eir chances
to" raise â  hay. report now gives assur
ance' of plentiful -crops, with a bright
prospect of an unusually good season.
A light, rain fell nearly all night and
beginning again about noon to-day it
haa continued to come down contin
uously. . Throughout ' the storm the
temperature has been mild and warm
and with little or no wind. Every
drop that fell has gone . into the
ground, and vegetation is rapidly
showing the effects of the last week's
wonderful weather. Grain is rapidly
showing in the valley sections and the
cattle and sheep men speak enthusi
astically of the feed upon the hills
and cattle ranges.
In the lower and middle portions of
Salinas Valley around Gonzales, Sole
dad, King City, San Lucas and Brad
ley the rainfall has been heavier than
in the upper sections. For the pres
ent storm Salinas has. had more
than an inch, making a total
of 6 inches for the season.
This is but an inch and a half
less than last season. King City has
received .48. San Lucas .52, Soledad
.4 0 and San Ardo .50 of an inch. At
last reports it was still coming down
at those places. In view of the fact
that the Salinas Valley, and especially
the middle and lower sections, can
raise fine crops on less than, half the
rainfall needed in other parts of the
State, the farmers are jubilant. The
present storm has been worth hun
dreds of thousands of dollars- to Mon
terey .County and has dispelled the
threatened dry year and will. result in
nn immediate and general revival of
business along all lines. With a rep
etition of the disasters of the dry year
of 1897 staring Monterey County in
the face, all lines of business have
been very conservative 'for the last
two months. Assured prospects for
another year will give an immediate
relief to the situation.
STORMING* IN LOS ANGELES.
Kninfrill in the South Is the Heaviest
During thc Season.
LOS ANGELES. Feb. 27.â Although
it had rained all around Los Angeles
County during the pest twenty-four
hours and in the mountains, the rain
fall having been extremely heavy, in
places, no rain fell in this city during
the present storm until 2 o'clock thi3
afternoon, when the storm broke here
in a manner which indicates that it
may nvike up for much that Los Ant
geles has missed in the way , of pre
cipitation. A steady downpour began
and continued until after 10 o'clock
to-night without ceasing. During
that time more than an inch of rain
fell in some parts of the city and out
Pas.idena way the rainfall was much
heavier. ' I
From Echo Mountain, near Mount
Lowe, to-night came the report that
nearly three inches of rain had fallen
during the day. Most needed in the
agricultural districts, the storm was
heaviest in those districts* and in tha
grain sections of Orange, Riverside and
San Bernardino counties ihe precipita
tion was heavier for a given time than
that of any previous storm this season.
â  To the northward, through the broad
Antelope Valley, there was a tremen
dous rainfall. It was in this section
that It was perhaps most welcome, for
there are thousands cf head of cattle
there, which have been suffering for
feed and water.
. - Cominc just at the Ume.lt did. after
the last rain had started the grass,
this storm means an abundance of feed
for stock and a plentiful supply of hay.
It does not assure a grain crop, for the
rains came too late to give this section
anything like the crops of cereals of
last year, but it helped the fruit sec
tions to a degree that hardly can be

WILLIAM CUTS
OUT ANTWERP
Emperor of Germany Sudden
ly Decides He Will Xot
Pay Visit to Belgian Town
WILL SEE GIBRALTAR
King Carlos of Portugal
to Meet Him at Vigo, Spain.
Will Sail on Koenig Albert
BERLIN,. Feb. 27.â Emperor William
has never traveled far in a modern pas
senger steamer, and that fact is given
as the reason for his taking the North
German Lloyd steamer Koenig Albert
on his twelve days' trip to the Mediter
ranean. His Majesty has rather sud
denly decided not to call an Antwerp at
all. No explanation is made of this
change in the plans. The Emperor will
go from Bremerhaven to Vigo, Spain,
direct. At the latter place King Carlos
of Portugal will doubtless meet him,
and at Gibraltar, where he will stay
two days, his Majesty will see the fort
ress for the first thime. He will debark
also for a few hours at Port Mahon,
and will leave the Koenig Albert and
board the imperial yacht Hohenzollern
at Messina on March. 24.- The Koenig
Albert will consequently be unable to
leave Genoa that day, as she is adver
tised to do.
The gossip regarding the Emperor
meeting President Loubet outside of
Brest is altogether incorrect. The
cruiser Heinrich II will convoy the
Koenig Albert all the way to Messina,
and afterward, with the dispatch boat
Sleipter, will accompany the Hohen
zollern in a leisurely four weeks' cruise
without a fixed itinerary to Corfu and
as far eastward as Athens, but not to
Constantinople. On his way back Em
peror William may see the King of
Italy at Naples. The Empress may join
the Emneror toward the end of the ex
cursion. The return will be made over
land, and at no time during the trip
will his Majesty be more than two days
out of reach of land.

Clement street and Forty-fifth and

containing eight lots frc-nting on Ash

the sale is under order of court and
the proceeds are required to pay some
of the' legacies now due under the will
of the late Adolph Sutro, the terms will
be cash, and every lot will be sold to

THE VALUEOF CHAUCOAIj.
Few People Know How "Useful It Is
In Preserving Health ami He.-mty. .
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal Is the cafest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value whon taken into
the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It is not a
drug at all. but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
tnem out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens tho breath after
smoking, drinking or aftor eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently r \te cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for the
money is in Stuart's Absorbent Loz-
enges; they are composed of the finest
powdered willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form or
rather In the form of large, pleasant
tasting lozenges, the charcoal being
mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health/better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but, on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to
all patients suffering from gas, In
stomach and bowels and to clear the
complexion and purify the breath,
mouth and throat; I also believe the
liver is greatly benefited ty the dally
use of them; they cost but 25 cents a
box at drug stores, and although in
some sense a patent preparation, yet
I believe I Ret more and better char-
coal in Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges
than in any Of the Ordinary r.bwr.oa.1
tablets."

BANKS REPORT
LARGE SURPLUS
Statement by Associated In
stitutions Shows Remark
able* Increase in Deposits
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.âThe Finan
cier says: One feature of the state
ment of the New York Associated
Banks last week was the gain of $4.
617.300 in cash, an amount $878,600
greater than that which was estima
ted from the traceable movements of
money during the week, and the total
holdings are now the highest ever re
ported. Another feature was the
high record for specie holdings by the
banks, these being $21,400,000 larger
than the highest previous amount,
which was $195,890,400, February 9,
1901. Still another feature was the
new high record for the year in sur
plus reserve.
SURPLUS OF $41,840,675.
The discrepancy between the in
crease in cash as officially reported
and that which was estimated was
probably due to the average for one
day; of a transfer hither of $625,000
gold from San Francisco on Friday
and also to the return of some of the
money which was sent to Baltimore a
fortnight ajro. which return move
ment was unrecorded in the estimates.
The deposits were decreased by the
comparatively small sum of $105,200,
and the required reserve was thereby
reduced by $26,300; this amount
added to the increase fn cash made
$4,fÂ«43,000 as the gain In surplus re
serve to $32,150,200. Computed upon
the basis of deposits less those of $38,
761.900 public funds, the surplus is
$41,840,675.
It is noteworthy that the Govern
ment deposits increased during the
week by $764,400, making $1,868,600
since the first week in February, re
flecting the concentration in the spe
cially designated depositories at New
York of deposits which have already
been withdrawn from country institu
tions in anticipation of the call for the
surrender of 20 per cent of the public
funds.
LOANS DECREASE.
Loans decreased $4, 229, 700 last
week, making a reduction of $9,360,
800 in the fortnight, indicating the
light inquiry for Stock Exchange re
quirements and the partial satisfac
tion of the demand from syndicate and
corporation borrowers; the circulation
decreased $332,300. The statement
showed a good proof, the sum of the
decrease in loans and in deposits being
$282,400 less than the increase in cash.
The daily average of clearings for
the five days was $178,000,000, or the
same as for the six days of the pre
vious week; the clearings on Saturday,
reflecting Friday's business, were
$176,853,917, or below the average.
The statement was made. up on rising
averages for cash and therefore this
week's return should show an increase
in this item. But with the Inquiry for
loans, small as it is now and is likely
to be In the near future, increases in
cash tend, to Intensify, the monetary
congestion. Comparisons of changes
in loans show that six banks reduced
this item by $2,300,000 net; the cash
in eight banks increased by $3,000,000
net. ... .

STOCK MARKET
AT STANDSTILL
Thursday's Eally Discour
ages Small Traders From
Attempting to Move Prices
BROKEES ABE. NERVOUS
Oriental Situation and the
Fear of a Strike in Coal
Regions Depresses Buyers
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â To-day's stock
market was almost idle and the drift of
prices was listless in the extreme and
toally insignificant. Yesterday's set
back to the rally which occurred on
j Thursday discouraged the traders from
; attempting to move prices, and to-day's
â¢trading indicated that the market is
j awaiting some new development to give
â¢ an initiative to prices. The fact that
another decision day of the Supreme
Court is imminent, with a decision in
I the Northern Securities case possibly to
I be handed down, aggravated the dull
ness. The beginning of the Paris stock
market settlement is another motive
for a waiting attitude In the securities
i market. The London market was prac
tically stagnant in response to this in
fluence. Pennsylvania's response to the
annual report was an advance of one
eighth, and Reading closed unchanged
in spite of the heavy decrease in the
net earnings for January.
The bank statement revealed a larger
gain in cash than indicated by the pre
liminary estimates, but speculative sen
timent would be more. encouraged were
there evidence of a more active use of
money in business. The decrease in
loans was not clearly explained, unless
by a report that some of the clearing
house banks have intimated to trust
companies their disinclination to carry
heavy deposits at 2 per cent. The mar
ket closed almost stagnant, but easy
and at small losses.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $410,
j 000.
I PRICES GO BACKWARD.
The tone of the stock market during
the week has been hesitating and Irreg
ular, Thursday's sharp recovery serv
ing to bring prices back almost exactly
to where they left off on Saturday last.
Conditions affecting values have not
perceptibly changed, the influences
which have depressed prices remaining
in force. The market, however, has
shown signs of being oversold, and the
day-to-day traders have been keenly
alive to signs that the decline in prices
had reached a point sufficient to offset
the conditions which brought it about.
The borrowing demand for stocks on
the Stock Exchange showed the build
ing up of a considerable short Interest
where demand to cover contracts might
be relied upon to effect a rally in prices
whenever conclusive evidence should
appear that the genuine selHng had de
creased so far as to promise. n6 hope
of a further decline. The foreign'situa
tion has had a dominating* Influence
upon the domestic stock market,, and
the troubled markets abroad have kept
alive the depression here. ' * '_ .
It is clear that the foreign stock
markets had not prepared themselves
adequately for the outbreak of hos
tilities between Russia and Japan, the
continental bourses especially showing
that strong hope was felt, up to the
outbreak of hostilities, that a peaceful
outcome would be secured. The vio
lent decline in the Russian industrial
and Government securities, which are
held in a great volume both in France
and Germany, involved heavy losses
and forced liquidation in other securi
ties for which there was a readier
market. Conspicuous in this class are
American securities, and the amount of
these which have come home to be
-sold effectually refund the contention
that foreign markets had been stripped
of American securities during the boom
of the last few years.
' FAILURES IN EUROPE.
The week's failures In European
banking circles and the money require
ment to be met* have effected the local
market for exchange and have helped
to lift it toward the gold export point.
Reports have been current that the
Russian Government was preparing to
draw down its heavy balances with
come of the great banks of Western
Europe. The dread of entanglement of
other powers in the Far East quarrel
or In the threatened outbreak in the
Balkans has been an additional dis
turbing element in all of the world's
markets and has been an important
influence upon our wheat market.
The nervous condition of our stock
market on Tuesday, while the Supreme
Court was in session, and the possibil
ity that a decision in the Northern Se
curities case was hanging over the
market, was a proof of the unsettling
influence which that market still has
GRAPE-NUTS.
TIMELY CALLING.
How the Pastor Saved a Life.
A man near Fort Gay, W. Va., made
an entire failure in getting: strength
from ihe kind of food he ate, and, not
knowing that the trouble was with the
food, kept on losing health until the
doctors gave him up to die.
It was supposed to be' consumption,
because he was wasting away steadily
and slowly dying. His minister called
from time to time and one day brought
along a package of Grape-Nutsy think-
ing from what hejenew of the famous
food that perhaps~it might help him.
The sick man took to it at once and
from that day began to get well. In
writing- he says:
"I walked to town to-day, three
miles. Have gained over forty pounds
in about two months and my neigh-
bors don't know what to say. I fre-
quently am told it was as if I am
raised from the dead. Everybody here
knows of my case, you can tell people
to write to the postmaster or Rev. L.
D. Bryan. I will make a. sworn state-
ment that Grape-Nuts saved my life."

where all other food fails one can 'be

and the likelihood of recurring ner
vousness on each decision day of the
court until the case is finally disposed
of. It is evident that the decision
when handed down, whatever may be
its tenor, will relieve the market from
one repressive influence. The declin
ing tendency of railroad earnings has
continued and the stock market is in
clined to wait for better weather con
ditions for proof of the contention that
snow blockades and impaired oper
ating efficiency from extreme cold
weather are responsible for all of the
decline in the present volume of traf
fic. The progress of the war over
grain rates, both on Western lines and
on the trunk lines, v is a cause of anx
iety over future traffic. The bitter
ness of the competition for these fu
ture contracts throws some doubts
upon the claims of railroad officials of
confidence in the maintenance of the
volume of traffic.
STRIKE EXPECTED.
The market is considering the ne
cessity of an adjustment also to a pos
sible great strike in the soft coal re
gions owing to the radical difference
In the claims of the miners for an in
crease in wages and of operators for
the necessity of a reduction.
Money on call Is extremely easy,
largely owing to the almost stagnant
condition of the stock market, but of
fering of loans have become less
abundant. Languid demand for
money outside. of railroad borrowing
and the falling off in the volume of the
bank clearings are regarded with some
misgivings as possible indications of
decreased business activity. The pos
sible delay in the settlement of the
Panama payments will disarrange
plans already effected for an early
completion of that operation, but ha3
caused no fear of embarrassment thus
far. The continued lack of moisture
in the Southwestern wheat field has
been a subject of attention, but with
out appreciable effect thus far on
prices of stocks.
The bond market has been dull and
irregular in sympathy with stocks.
United States bonds were unchanged

The Popular
Vote of 1904
Is Unanimously In Favor of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets-They Are
the Nation's Favorite.
: Xo article on the market, whatever
bÂ« the purpose for which it was
created, can be a phenomenal success
and be universally popular unless it
possesses great and unfailing merit.
Inferior and worthless articles may
nourish for a limited time if their
praises a.re sung by sufficient clever
and catchy advertising; but their days
are numbered from the start and their
finish is a foregone conclusion. This is
an age of the survival of the fittest,
and only articles of true worth endure.
The unparalleled and phenomenal
success of Stuan's Dyspepsia Tablets
from a business standpoint is not un- ,
natural nor surprises. It is due di- i
rectly to their unparalleled and phen-
omenal success in curing multiplied
thousands of cases of dyspepsia
throughout the English-speaking :
world. 1
The reason of the wonderful success
of Stuart'c Dyspepsia Tablets is so [
plain and simple that a, child can un-
derstand. It is this and nothing j
more; they are natural in their work- ,
iii^s and effects. They take up the
work of the worn and wasted stomach 'â 
and do It just as the stomach did when
It was well and strong and able. They
actually digrest the food and do it thor- j
oughly, completely and independently, '
thus giving the weak and weary
Ktonuu.li an opportunity to renew and
regain its wasted strength. You for- j
ga that you have a stomach just as
. you did when you were a healthy boy
or girl and nature restores and heals
that organ and makes it well and
strong.
A St. Louis business man says: "I
was a confirmed dyspeptic for years.
What I ate had to be forced down and j
most of it soured or lay like lead in
my stomach and did me no good. I
was in constant misery both in mind
and body and came to be cranky,
morose and irritable. My natural dis-
position, which was cheerful and !
pleasant, left me and I was alienating
all my friends. The doctors did me no
good. . I got so I hated the sight or
name of a doctor. My wife finally
worried me into buying a box of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which I
began taking under protest, as I had
no fiiith in anything or anybody. I j
was sore on creation.- j
71 had not taken a third of that box ;
before I noticed a decided and most j
welcome change. I could enjoy a good
meal and feel no bad effects following !
it. I forgot my stomach and had a |
chance to think about something else.
I went ahead with my business in ease
and comfort. Six boxes of Stuart's
Dyspepia Tablets at a total outlay of
$3 cured me completely and I have
not suffered a pain from dyspepsia for !
two years. I have an appetite like a '
16-year-old boy. I wish every one !
who suffers from dyspepsia could I
know what a change this great remedy
made in me."
tjtuai;fs Dyspepsia. Tablets are for
sale by druggists everywhere at 50
cents a box. All druggists carry them
and the best doctors are prescribing
them. You need not fear that you will j
exer be unable to get them; for, be-
cause of the good they have done
mankind and the suffering they have
relieved and the happiness they have
caused, the fame and the success and
the popularity of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets from generation unto genera-
tion will endure.

TAKE APPEAL
FROM JUDGMENT
3IacIicn and Associates Are
Sentenced toliiiprisoninent
for Two Years in Prison
MUST ALSO PAY FINES
Defendants Are Released on
Bail Pending Review of
Case in the Higher Court
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â August W.
Macben,* formerly general superintend
ent of the free delivery postal service;
Dr. George F. Lorenz of Toledo, once
Postmaster of that city, and Diller Ii.
GrofT of this city, all of whom were
convicted of conspiracy against the
Government in connection with the
supply of Groff fasteners to the Post
office Department, to-day were sen
tenced by Judge . Pritchard to two
years' imprisonment in the Mounds
ville, "W. Va., penitentiary and a fine of
$10,000 each. The defendants imme
diately gave notice of appeal to the
Court of Appeals and were released on
$20,000 bonds.
Samuel A. Groff. as to whom Special
Counsel Conrad for the Government
said some days ago that there was not
sufficient evidence to convict, was not
sentenced, and his motion for a new
trial and for arrest of judgment being
allowed further consideration, his coun
sel was given four days within which
to prepare to argue the motions. The
sentence imposed on Machen, Lorenz
and Dilier B. Groff was the maximum
allowed under the law, although the
court, contrary to the contentions of
the prosecution, decided that the sev
eral counts in the indictment consti
tuted but one offense. The appeals to
the upper court will be pressed as rap
idly as possible, according to the de
fense, but months may elapse before
they can be heard.
The Government has not yet decided
on its next step In the prosecution of
the postal cases, in which there have
been so many indictments in which
Machen is named involving offenses
other than that covered in the indict
ment on which he has already been
convicted, which will be pressed for
trial next. There are fourteen indict
ments against Machen, either singly
or jointly with others, and the Govern
ment expects to bring him to trial on
most of them.
WICKED SLASH
ENDS THE FIGHT
Wielder of Knife Brings a
Union Meeting to a Sudden
and Dramatic Termination
There were lively times at the meet
ing of the Stablemen's Protective
Union at its headquarters at 12 Eighth
street last night. During an executive
session the members became involved
in many wordy wars. At last a dispute
between two of the board came near
ending in murder.
The lie passed between Edward Tay
lor, who resides at 39^ West Mission
street, and Thomas White. As the ar
gument grew warmer Taylor, it is
claimed, made an assault on White.
Other members of the committee tried
to pacify the pair, but Taylor, so it is
said, kept advancing. White, when he
found that he was about to be beaten,
reached into his pocket and, drawing a
large pocket knife, slashed Taylor
across the face, inflicting several
wounds that required many stitches.
Steward Emil Bertrand fixed up Tay
lor's face. Police Officer Thomas Kinch
was on the scene soon after the trouble
started, but before he could gain ad
mittance to the headquarters White
climbed over the rear fence and made
good his escape.
CAPTAIN" OP COLUMBIA
GETS LETTER OF THANKS
Minister Powell Praises Gallant Offi
cers and Men of the United
States Cruiser.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27. â Before
Captain Miller of the cruiser Columbia
left Dominican waters, he received a
formal letter of thanks from United
States Minister Powell, in the course
of which the Minister said:
"Allow me to say that our people in
the States owe very much to our navy
and to the officers for the able and effi
cient manner in which they at all
times have maintained the national
honor and conserved American inter
ests abroad, and. when such occasions
have occurred they have won and add
ed new laurels not only for themselves
but for the nation at large and added a
new page to our country's history.' The
American people cannot be too proud
of their naval vessels and the officials
who man them, as they stand to-day
before the world as the great bulwark
of the nation's defense and the na
tion's honor."

SPEEDY ITALIAN PRODUCES
FAMILY BURDENS IN COURT
-Gharged With a^Bqny Horse,* He Shows^Jiidge

fi ..Cuts Loose on Charles Wilson With a,., Gun
Gid Ciraulo is full of troubles." He
appeared before Judge Fritz yesterday
charged with fast driving and cruelty
to a bony bay horse which draws a
wagon full of oranges, which Ciraulo
vends in stirring tones. Yesterday he
was trying to make the horse beat a
world's record for five furlongs and
belabored the animal cruelly with a
stout whip. Two po-licemen were do
ing duty as patrol Judges on the far
turn and they took the Italian driver
into custody.
Cirauio brought his numerous tribe
into court to plead for him. There was
a wife with a squalling baby in her
arms and four other children hanging
to her skirts, with only erne year sep
arating them in ages.
i "This looks like race suicide," said
Prosecutor Harris. "Has the defend
ant any more children?"
"There are three. more," said the de
fendant's attorney, "but they are sell
ing gum in the rain to-day to eke out
the slender purse of the family."
"A man with a family as large as
this defendant possesses has all that
is coming to him in the way of tribu
lation and I am inclined to dismiss
him," said Judge Fritz, "although it
is apparent that he was driving a half
fed horse at an unlawful rate of speed."
"I hava de larga family, Excelenti
misso." said Ciraulo, "and mucha did
I doa de harda" graft for feed dem.
Clemencia dees time, signor. I be de
poora man." .
"Why, didn't you think of the poor
children, before you acquired the"
tribe?" asked Prosecutor Harris.
Judge Fritz finally let the man of
family go after warning him that if
ever he beat a beast again he would
order him executed the following morn
ing at sunrise.

Joseph May came before Judge Con-
Ian yesterday on a charge of assault
with a. deadly weapon. He was ar
rested at 3 o'clock yesterday morning
by Policeman Joy after he had taken
four shots at the. disappearing form of
Charles Wilson.
May is a bartender in a saloon at
400 Pacific street and Wilson Is a por
ter at a similar joint at 521 Pacific
street. Wilson tanked up considerably
on the booze of the dump where he is
employed. and' then Journeyed down to
the quieter quarters presided -over by
May.- â¢ : : M'>.''.. â¢ '
A fo-ugh house immediately, ensued.
May drey/ 'forth two trusty guns with
the idea of running a good, strong bluff,
according to his statement. Wilson was
not to' be buffaloed, by this, show of
force and mixed things. He succeeded
in. securing one ,of the weapons and
threw it on the floor. .â¢ Then the horror
of the second' gun came upon him and
he made a get away, carrying nearly
the entire front of . the- establishment
with him in his exit. . -
May followed the fleeing man to the
street and cut loose , four times. : He
claimed that he was shooting merely
to attract the attention of the police
and had no desire to puncture ' the
anatomy of Wilson with a leaden .mis
sile. For. such amicable 'Intentions 'his
attorney- asked that his bail be reduced
to $50. The Judge took the. case. under
advisement until Monday. â¢
Frank H. Shannon is supposed by
the police to have taken, the gold cure,
E. K. Gillen accused'him yesterday be
fore Judge Fritz of having stolen $5
from him. Gillen was in front of a
cigar stand on Kearny street Friday
night and laid down $5 in gold to pay
for a couple of cigars. He went to
light one of the weeds and when he
returned the celrk'eyed him glassily
and asked for payment.
Gillen produced a quarter and then
went in search of his yellow metal. He
found Shannon making a hot-foot
away from the counter and accused
him of the theft. Shannon indignant
ly denied the crime and surrendered
himself peaceably to Policeman Mor
iarity. â¢
When he was searched the missing
$5 piece was not discoverable. Gillen
maintained that Shannon" had swal
lowed It, but the defendant was dis
missed by Judge Fritz yesterday. The
Judge"declared that the charter makes
no provision for X-ray, examinations of
a man's stomach in such cases and
personally he declined to purchase a
pound of radium to aid the causs of
justice in such a doubtful case.
Attorney Charles K. Moser appeared
yesferday in Judge. Mogan's court on
behalf of two flower sellers in front
of Lotta's fountain and demanded jury
trials for the 'defendants. They were
arrested for : obstructing the sidewalk
and their cases are mostly to test pub
lic oplnlon t on one of the most impres
sive and picturesque . features of San
Francisco life. Eastern visitors never
fail to discover the flower market and
comment . on the (fact that February
violets or roses cost $5 a bunch in a
cold country, where 10 cents will pay
the damage in the metropolis of the
Pacific Ocean. â  ;^ ' '
John/ Burke was sentenced to six
months in the County Jail yesterday
by Judge Conlan. The defendant made
a forcible entry into Smith's cash store
on Market street and abstracted a pair
of trousers. Then, instead of putting
the garment to its proper use, he
traded it off for two glasses of steam
beef, in "a^ Fourth-street mart, where
the largest glasses and the bestweiner
wursts are advertised for sale. The
original charge against him was bur
glary, but he, was' allowed to plead
guilty to petty larceny.
,,The continued hearing of Thomas F.
Brennan. who is accused of felony em
bezzlem'eht 'in the sum of $37,000 from
an aged and Infirm priest named Fath
er P. J. Grey, was tohave been on trial
in Judge Fritz's, court yesterday, but
the. Illness c-f one . of the defendant's
attorneys necessitated a postponement
until to-morrow afternoon:
.Thomas Reynolds is a youthful speci
men of a bad^ actor, who parts, his hair
in the middle and always^manages to
wear good clothes. He was before
Judge Fritz yesterday on : a. charge of
grand larceny. .J.. P. Mulhern: claimed
.that Reynolds snatched a diamond ,pin
from .his. necktie { Jn front 'jof
Square^' The thief alsb took the tie in
.his effort to secure the pin:
...Archie Campbell, attorney; for the de--.
Xendant. made a strci'ne-'Dlea* for mercy

age. A weeping mother also added her
cjuota^Ior^tflemency ; for her" wayward
offspring: 1 : . . ' " , â¢' â 'â ' *
:, Unfortunately. , for Reynolds,' whose
true^njwif is.JCarson, Judge Fritz iden
tlhed' him ss'ai ifre'quent offender, who
has been before the court numerous
.times . for picking v pock0ts \ and rolling
, drunks. Despite the tears of the moth
i er and the eloquent plea of the attor
ney, Reynolds was held to answer to
the Superior Court in bonds of, $2000.
Mrs. Edith Blune received her be
longings back yesterday. She is the
20-year-old girl who. hitched herself to
Harry Blune, who is nearly 70 years
of age, and who was sentenced Friday
to five months in the County .Jail by
Judge Cabanies for obtaining by false
pretenses a quantity of gloves from
the Imperial Glove Company.
It was a mating of December and
May, also by false pretenses. Blune
represented himself as a man of wealth
and standing arid won a beautiful wife.
When she ascertained that he had
served twice in the penitentiary for
grand larceny she left him. Her trdnk
was held for a board bill which Blune
had neglected tc- pay. Policeman Lake,
whose wife conducts the house on Turk
street where Blune lodged his wife, told
Judge Fritz yesterday that they wished
to make no claim on the belongings of
Mrs. Blune, because they believed her
an unfortunate victim of a designing
man.

KENNEDY MAY ESCAPE
PENALTY FOR CRIME
District Attorney Allowed Two Weeks
To Produce More Testimony, or
Case Will Be Dismissed.
When the case of William B. Ken
nedy, alias Richard Jackson, alias "Yel
low," who has been granted a new trial
by the Supreme. Court, was called in
Judge Cook's court yesterday the Judge
said that unless the District Attorney
could produce further- evidence by
March 12 he wou!d have to dismiss the
case in view of the decision of the high
er court.
Kennedy was one of the thugs tried
end convicted for the murder of Police
man Eugene C. Robinson at Sixteenth
and Valencia streets on the morning of
January 21, 1002. He was sentenced to
imprisonment for life by Judge Cook,
hut an appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court on the ground that the de
fendant could not be convicted on the
uncorroborated testimony of an ac
complice, William Henderson, who
turned State's evidence.
The District Attorney feels satisfied
that the police will be able before
March 12 to get corroborative testi
mony sufficient to satisfy the require
ments of the law and prevent a danger
ous criminal from escaping punishment
for his participation in the cold-blooded
murder of a young officer.

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES
BY NOTED MEN AND
WOMEN
Sequoia Gigantca.
BY WILLIAM R- DUDLEY,
(Professor of Bot*ny. Stanford University.)
<The general interest in the bill now be
fore Congress for the preservation of the
<--E.laveras prove of bis tr*eÂ« makes any
<;Â«.ta pertaining to these marvelous works of
nature of more than usual Interest. The
following new and heretofore unpublished
factÂ» concerning: the Sequoia iflgantea. repre
**r.tlnr the researches of rrofesaor William
n. Dudley of Stanford University, were pre
sented to the Senate by I'latt of Connecticut
â with a view to enlightening his colleagues
upon the subject of California's giant trees.)
The age of the Sequoia gigantea can
only be obtained by actually counting
the concentrated rings of growth on the
cross section of the felled tree. Of the
trees carefully examined and the rings
counted the oldest possessed 2425 rings,
<.Â«â  had begun its existence 525 B. C. Ex
tended scrutiny undoubtedly would
bring to light trees that were older, al
though few in number. I do not expect
any to exceed S000 years in this cutting.
Does each annular ring of the struc
ture seen in the cross section represent
a year's growth? It does in the climate
of the Pacific Coast, with its sharply
marked wet and dry seasons. I have
been able repeatedly to demonstrate
this in Monterey pines, Monterey cy
presses, Sequoia sempervirens, and
even in Sequoia gigantea itself in such
specimens in the arboretum of Stanford
University as we have removed on ac
count of injury from insect attack or
drought.
A remarkable recuperative power fol
lowing an injury was found after ex
amination of the sequoias of the Con
verse Basin. The effects of certain tre
mendous forest fires occurring centuries
ago were registered in the trunks of
these trees and the record completely
concealed by subsequent healthy
growth. Among a number of similar
cases the most instructive record of
these ancient f crest fires was observed
in a tree of moderate size â about 15
feet in diameter â 5 feet from the
ground. It was 270 feet in height and
2171 years old.
This tree when felled had an enor
mous surface burn on one side 4 30 feet
in height and occupying 18 feet of the
circumference til the tree; this was
found to have been due to a fire occur
ring in A. D. 1797. The tree when cut.
in 1900, had already occupied Itself for
103 years in its efforts to repair this
injury, its method being the ingrowing
of the new tissue from each margin of
the great black wound. When the tree
was cut the records of three other fires
were revealed. The history of the tree
was as follows:
271 B. C it b&gan its existence
The firet year of the Christian era it
was about 4 feet in diameter above the
base.
245 A. D., at 516 years of age. occurred
a burning on the trunk 3 feet wide.
One hundred and five years were occu
pied in covering this wound with new
tissue. For one thousand one hundred
and ninety-six years no further Injuries
were registered.
1441 A. D.. at 1712 years of age, the
tree was burned a second time in two
long grooves 1 and 2 feet wide, respec
tively. Each had its own system of re
pafr.
One hundred and thirty-nine years of
growth followed, including the time oc
cupied by covering the wounds.
15S0 A. D., at 1S51 years of age, occur
red another fire, causing a burn on the
trunk 2 feet wide, which took fifty-six
years to cover with new tissue.
Two hundred and seventeen years of
growth followed this burn.
1797 A. D., when the tree was 2068
years old, a tremendous fire attacked
it, burning the great scar IS feet wide.
One hundred and three years, be.
tween 1797 and 1900, h: : enabled the
tree to reduce the exposed- area of the
burn to about 14 feet in widlh.
It is to be noted that in each of the
three older burns there was a thin cav
ity occupied by the charcoal of burned
surface, but the wounds were finally
fully covered and the new tissue above
was full, even, continuous, and showed
no sign of distortion or of the old
wound.
The above details are given to show
.the wonderful vitality and freedom
from disease and decay possessed by
these trees. If protected from fire and
the lumberman they would undoubtedly
live to a much greater age than at
present, and would furnish the best
living objects for scientific study and
measurement covering a long period
of years extending from one human
generation to another. These measure
ments would have a bearing on our
knowledge of the laws of growth as
affected by periods of varying climatic
conditions. It happens that the only
measurements already made were made
on the Calaveras big trees tl.Irty years
ago by the geological survey of Califor
nia. It comes near being a crime to not
only destroy objects among the most
interesting in the world, but to throw
away data useful to the science of the
future, as will be done if the Calaveras
trees are felled.
African Pigmies.
DT WILLIAM STAMPS CHERRY".
'.African traveler, oxplorer and big game
hunter.)
(Copyright. 19CH, by Joseph B. Bow!es.)
Some authorities seem %o think that
the undersized people found In the
gloomy depths of the dark forests are
the aboriginal settlers of Africa. That
the pigmies, as they are called, have
any better claim than other African
races of to-day to the distinction of
being the living representatives of the
flrrt people seems to me improbable.
These people, who are slightly under
stature, live in the forest, where they
get little sunlight. They live on meat
principally, and when that cannot be
had resort to reptiles and insects. They
hunt with bows and arrows or spears.
They have all kinds of traps, such ai
sllpnooses attached to a flexible pole,
which is planted upright in the ground,
then bent over to set the trap. "When
the animal tries to get through the
loop the pole springs back into place,
carrying the victim into the air, where
it is strangled. They have a net some
what on the principle of that used by
the gladiators in the arena of Rome, in
which they entangle the wild animals.
They dig holes in the paths, driving
sharpened poisoned sticks in the bot
tom, then covering the holes with
leaves. In the grass they strew poison
ed thorns, and have sharpened sticks
two or three feet long set in the ground
at an angle of thirty or forty degrees,
so that they will stick in the legs as
their enemy runs into them. These are
hid away about their plantations of
plantains, or around their villages.
Three pigmies can kill an elephant,
and with only a few thrusts of a spear
on which they use a vegetable â¢poison.
They understand the business and con
fidence makes them brave. My meas
urements from a tribe of these people
on the Sanga who called themselves
N'bgongo, and others of the Mobangi,
show the average pigmy to be slightly
under five feet, almost as large as an
average-sized American woman. They
were much larger than I had expected.
They had the strictly African features,
the flat nose and round face, legs short
and well developed, big hips. The
greater curvature of the spine made
the stomach protrude. The arms were
long and not so well developed as the
legs, which is the case with all inland
tribes, while with those using canoes
the arms are the best developed. The
women are conspicuous by their short,
stumpy legs and big hips. They often
become the wives of the ordinary Afri
can. The children of these unions are
as large as the average African. The
pigmies of the Sanga have square huts
and the others reported north of Ban
gui in the primeval forest that skirts
the Mobangui Lake are said also to
have square huts; those between the
Ouelle and Aruimma have the round
hut, which is about as large as the huts
of the larger Africans.
The greatest musical genius I ever
came across was a reputed pigmy at
Stanley Falls, who sang, or rather
hummed to an accompaniment which
he played on an instrument of eight
strings drawn across a board fourteen
inches long and ten inches wide, with
bridges under each string at different
places to tune it. It was a very ingen
ious, and altogether a sweet pounding
and pleasant little affair. The musician
had a broken jaw.
Dr. Junker's conservative statements
would lead one to believe from his first
measurement of a man of five feet that
there . uere many over that measure
ment as well as under. Schweinfurth.
who first told the civilized world of
these small people of the Upper Ouelle,
is very conservative also, and although
he and Dr. Junker think these people
of slightly under stature a race apart,
there la still an interrogation point
after reading their opinion, as' neither
of them saw the pigmies in their vil
lages. Stanley gives the smallest meas
urements of these people, yet reading
his work closely for absolute state
.ments we are'still in doubt, as he does
not state that he saw them In their
villages. The villages were there, but
the pigmies were not, and taking the
measurements of a few is very mislead
ing. Since Stanley, though much has
been published, the question remains
where he left it. Few have been the
additions to his picture of the great
forest. Summing up the whole thing
from my own experience and the actual
facts as given by other explorers, what
is said of the pigmy can be said of
many other African tribes. He differs
only in his stature; his features,
physique, his mode of life, hunting, his
traps, are used among all the tribes
and are essentially as much theirs as
his. The poisoned weapons are not so
common, but they are known, while his
religion and patriarchal laws are those
of the other African people.
Living in the bush without adequate
sunlight, living on meat, often resorting
to an insectivorous diet, might account
'tc-r the slight decrease in stature. Why
should not the climate and conditions
decrease the stature as well as increase
it?
On the Mobangui River, situated on a
high, impregnable bluff, three days be
low Bangui, is a village of giants, every
man of them over six feet and some
measuring seven. It is well known to
the white man. These giants are of
splendid physique, their muscles stand
ing out like those of a Hercules. They
are rather lighter brown than the aver
age African. Their heads are a bad
shape and impress one as unintelligent;
their faces are beastly. They live on
plantains', manioc and the' cola nut.
They are in the country of the gorilla
and chimpanzee, and seem not to have
varied from the ways of these animals
in food and general life. Yet I never
heard these people spoken of as the
missing link, or degenerates, and they
are more nearly related to the big^apes
than the undersized people known as
the pigmies.
Of all the photogn* phs published of
these small people, there is but one that
I have seen that is satisfactory. They
seem to be either children or "runts.*
Children have a peculiar stomach that
is seldom found in an adult, and is
easily distinguished by an experienced
observer. Among tribes of average
build I found smaller specimens than
among the people called pigmies. I
found a dwarf that measured under
three feet fix inches, an old wrinkled
man. but he was a M'Sacklaw. I found
another slightly taller: he could stand
under my arm with ease, and the peo
ple were very proud of him. He was
a Linda. Among the Banzirrf was a
man with ape feet and hands, the big
toe was split away back short, and held
in the position of a monkey's: he was
small and his features seemed borrowed
from a chimpanzee. u

THE NAVY BILL.
AFTER a prolonged fight the House has passed
â¢ the navy bill substantially as it was reported by
the committee. Many attempts were made to
make a party issue of it, and these will doubtless be re
newed iii the Senate. The answer to all such attempts is
found in the history of the country. If the Democrats
will read the oration of Senator Voorhees at the unveil
ing of the Farragut monument, they, will get a different
viewpoint from that held by those among them who op
pose the navy.
We have on the two oceans a greater coast line than
any other nation. Along that line are great cities. On
the Gulf and Atlantic coasts are Galveston, New Or
leans, Mobile, Savannah, Charleston, New York and
Boston, with Baltimore and Philadelphia in a position of
secondary exposure. On the Pacific we have San Fran
cisco and San Diego, with Los Angeles, Portland and
the Sound cities in secondary exposure. These cities
offer a richer spoil in war than all the wealth of the an
cient empires, for which great armies â  struggled. To
provide a navy capable of defending these coasts is a
matter of ordinary prudence. No one wants war and no
one expects it. But the history of the nations proves
that war may come, no matter how strictly a country
may attend to its own affairs,- and that lack of prepara
tion is merely an invitation to attack.
It seems to be the theory of some of the opponents
of a navy adequate for our maritime defense that if we
have no navy we will need no defense. That may come
true when the millennium arrives, but that happy time
is not yet in sight. Only one thing will ever justify us
in -letting our navy decline, and that will be a general
international agreement to abate the naval force ; of
each maritime nation down to a low and economical
minimum.
What the anti-naval party in Congress should pro
pose is not invitation to attack by crippling our sea
power, but a peace commission to all the other mari
time countries to secure such an agreement. That would
test the policy they advocate and would establish it
either as a chimera or a fact. Unless they do this, they
should withdraw opposition. From the beginning of our
history we have sought and depended upon sea power.
During the Revolution we had but little of such power,
but it was used with excellent effect, and Paul Jones gave
a chapter to our book of glory that no American would
willingly blot out. In the War of 1812 our sea power had
increased, and the ffcats of Lawrence, Bainbridge and
Decatur on the sea and of Commodore Perry on Lake
Erie are imperishable witnesses to the need of a navy
and to the ability of Americans to fight at sea.
President Roosevelt says: "The Spanish war was a
little war, but it was all the war there was." Suppose
that our navy had been what it was when William C.
Whitney took up the work of naval construction! Spain
would have whipped us, notwithstanding her vast infe
riority in resources. With no navy we could not have
sent a single soldier to be landed in Cuba or Porto Rico.
With no navy the Spanish fleet need not have waited
death in Manila Bay before Cavite, but would have tor
mented our whole t Pacific Coast. It could have coaled
in our harbors in spite of us, and its guns,' though in
efficiently served, would have been so much better than
none at all that our humiliation would have been com
plete. N
It is easy to say that we ought not to have had the
Spanish war. The answer is that we oid have it, and that
in response to the demand of the people, who were ready
to crush any administration and party that refused to
gratify them. II it were a mistake the people made it.
It was their war. whether justified or not, and if a mis
take who will guarantee the people against making an
other just like it? So, from whatever point our last war
is viewed, its lesson reads for a strong navy. Without
the naval operations before Cavite and Santiago we
would have presented a sorry figure.
In the current war between Japan and Russia, the
weaker nation has equalized herself with an enemy six
fold her superior in resources, by her naval equipment.
If Japan succeed in holding her superiority in sea power
on the east coast of Asia, she may wear out her stronger
enemy, just as Spain would have worn us out if we had
lacked a navy.
To extend the argument into commerce, one ship in
our navy has produced commerce for us in value far ex
ceeding the whole cost of our existing navy. It is de
clared by American experts in Europe that the foreign
market. was opened to American machinery and metal
products by the warship Oregon. When that ship was
being built at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco,
no one foresaw that she was to be a key to unlock a new
market. But when the Spanish war put her on trial she
proved to be the best piece of work ever wrought in
metal by man. As an example of American constructive
skill she left the rest of the world so far behind that the
markets yearned for American mechanism. â¢ She still
iloats, the best ship that ever kissed the water, and until
she is excelled our constructive work ..will hold its pri
macy. This should be considered by those who say that
there should be no money spent on the navy, but that it
should be diverted to other uses which will give "an imme
diate and material return.
Some of Uncle Sam's warships arc now at Hongkong,
a little too far away to watch the movements , of the
Russians and the Japanese and too close to be out, of
danger of rubbing the Bear's fur the wrong way. The
time is now certainly for our fighting sailor men' to learn
the splendid lesson that discretion is nine parts of valor.
WAGES OF RURAL CARRIERS.
PRESIDENT CUNNINGHAM - of â . the . National
Rural Letter Carriers' Association has â : addressed
a strong plea to the country at large in behalf of
a measure now before Congress which aims at an in
crease in the of the .'rural free delivery
letter carriers. 'The carriers have formally asked for an
increase of salary dependent upon length df_service. -In
stead of the $600 per annum flat rate. of wage which they,
are receiving now. the carriers 'would have the Govern
ment pay them $600 for the first year, $720 .for thesecond
and $850 for the third and all succeeding years.
It seems that for the good of the rural delivery service
and in all fairness to the men employed, therein, Con
gress should pay heed to this petition of the 'carriers' for
an advanced wage. In a recent report the Fourth Assist
ant Postmaster General has advocated raising' the. sala
ries of all those carriers whose route is ; not\ less -than
twenty-five miles in length to $750, but at^thc same- time
curtailing all. privileges of carrying on an 'express busi
ness. This recommendation can hardly fill thebrcachi
for, ' ; save, in the Western country, ; there is.- not one.car
rier in fifteen whose route comes â  within the twenty-five
mile" limit and the^ limitation of the advanced wage to
these few would be unfair discrimination. On the other
hand,: if the merit of service be allowed to count for an
increase of wages such as the carriers suggest, the effect
would be an inducement to long continued service on the
part of those who have proved their efficiency.
Among those opposed to the extension of the rural
free delivery system there arc some who say that if the
present growth continues to mark the progress of the
newly installed service, there will soon be 50,000 carriers
drawing annually. $30,000,000 from the national treasury.
These of the pessimistic turn of mind do not seem to
take into consideration the fact that the rural free de
livery system has increased the postal revenue already to
an extent which more than covers the cost to the Gov
ernment. Should Congress see fit to grant the deserved
increase of wages to the carriers, the increased use of the
mails which has followed the adoption of the rural de
livery system would rapidly wipe out the deficit thereBy
created.
A Russian rioter, convicted of participation in the
Kishenev massacres, was sentenced recently to an im
prisonment of one ye*ar. The judgment of the court
is either an. imposition upon the prisoner or an insult
to civilization. It is such compromises as this that
make Russia odious in the eyes of the world.
BRITISH LIQUIDATIONS.
THE recent publication in London of the twelfth an
nual report of the "Inspector-General in Com
panies' Liquidation" has aroused a good deal of in
terest in Great Britain on account of the extraordinary
showing of losses on the part of investors in stock com
panies. It appears :that the capital involved in liquida
tions during 1902 amounted to Â£64,270,454, and of that
amount nearly Â£30,000,000, or upward of $150,000,000,
was made up of capital supplied by the investing public.
These figures<vvhile extraordinary in themselves are
not. much above the annual amounts of such failures,
though they exceed those of last year by about one^mil
lion sterling. During the last ten years the total capital
involved in such failures reached the sum of Â£560,000,
000. Of course the whole of that enormous sum was
not lost, for the actual amount of loss depends upon the
result of the liquidations. Unfortunately no exact statis
tics are available on that point.
A London authority in reviewing the report says:
"The actual money loss during the past decade is heavy
enough. The Inspector-General puts it at over Â£380,000,
000. Besides, it must be borne in mind that during the
ten years in question about 11,000 companies which did
not go into actual liquidation -were, for various reasons,
struck off the register and ceased to exist: and although
it may be assumed that the majority of these represent
abortive attempts to form Companies, yet the Inspector-
General is informed by the Registrar that in many cases,
including cases where the assets have been swept off by
debenture holders, they represent a considerable amount
of capital which does not enter into the foregoing esti
mate of loss."
As we have no official figures in America correspond
ing to'those of the 'British report," we cannot make any
reliable comparison of the rate and the proportion of
failures of stock â¢ companies and losses of investors be
tween the two countries. Our. people, however, are more
speculative than the British, and it is quite likely our
showing of losses, were the statistics compiled, would be
even greater than those reported from London. Taken
altogether, it will be seen that the profits of the so-called
"bloated capitalists" are by rip means so great as is some
times supposed. Men of enterprise take big risks in de
veloping new countries and establishing new industries,
and when all is said and done, they will generally be
found to have deserved whatever profits may come to
them from successful ventures.
Diplomats resident in Washington are now discussing
cheerfully the prospects of the Emperor of Korea hav
ing his thoroughly â¢ respectable, unoffending existence
closed by. assassination. Perhaps, since the .Japanese
have taken everything else the Emperor has on earth,
they may as well finish'thcir job by taking his life.
ABOUT THE DOWAGER.
â  â " k â  FEW days ago the wars and rumors of war were
/\ " interrupted and driven off the. wires by a report
â *â  *â  that the Dowager Empress of China was dead.
T|i An is her name arid she is a remarkable woman.
Born a slave, she became a wife of an Emperor, and be
fore he rested from his labors in the tombs of the Man
chus, Tsi An outranked the other empresses and played
the part of leading lady. Since then no matter who has
been Emperor she has governed China, and is 'by no
means second to Semiramis, Tomyris, Catherine, Eliza
beth and the other ladies, who have shown that they can
run empires just as well as men.
Remarkable as she has. been hitherto, Tsi An's present
status, in the eye of the news reading world, eclipses all
of her past performances. She lay dead in the headlines
of an afternoon uapcr inSan Francisco for an hour, and
then was restored to life in an opposition paper. She
was dead in a rumor for twenty-four hours at Sacra
mento, .and f is still dead at Eureka 'in Humboldt County
and in Salt Lake. Some hours after her restoration to
life in San Francisco she died in Chicago a natural death,
and was poisoned at Pittsburg and Baltimore. In some
of the New. England towns she committed suicide and
in others was stabbed, through Jier corset, if she wore
one, and in. Minnesota her death was immediately fol
lowed.by the dismemberment of the empire she had ruled
so .long. In several Southern States she was merely ill,
while, lying dead in other- parts of the_United States. In
a very, fevv places. she was, alive and hearty enough to be
taking tea with Mrs. Conger, wife of the American Min
ister to Peking.
K We await news from Europe to. see what Tsi An's
fate is in theother hemisphere, though, what happened
to her' in this- country' is of sufficient variety to satisfy
the. most exacting- appetite for novelty. The Chinese
legation in â ..Washington, could make a big book put of
what happened to its : august and' imperial mistress â¢ in
theY brief,* space {of* forty-eight â¢'hours, in the American

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Close Call for Lees.
Several detectives were talking the
other day about notorious crooks and
the narrow escapes that happened
sometimes to sleuths while making ar
rests.
"About the narrowest escape that I
can recall," said one. "happened to
the late Chief Lees. A porch climber
had been at work for some time and
had robbed several of the big houses in
the Western Addition. One day a
young fellow who had been used as a
confederate by the porch climber,
whose name was Reese, called at a
jewelry store, at that time on Sutter
and Kearny streets, to sell a valuable
diamond. The jeweler looked at the
diamond and suspecting it had been
stolen refused to hand it back to the
young man and quietly notified police
headquarters.
"Lees hurried to the store and in
the meantime the young man had told
Reese of his experience. Reese was an
.athletic young fellow and he hastened
to the store intending to recover the
diamond or kill the jeweler. Lees was
there before him and as he entered
and made a threatening demand for
the return of the diamond Lees grab
bed hold of him. Reese shook Lees off
and made a movement toward his hip
pocket. Lees grappled with him again,
but was quickly knocked down. Just
as Reese pulled a revolver out of. his
hip pocket and was about to fire at Lees
Tommy Ellis, who was then a plumber
and happened to me passing the store
at the time, rushed in and dealt Reese a
blow on the head with a kit of tools
he was carrying in his hand, knocking
him down. Reese was promptly over
powered and handcuffed. Lees was so
grateful to Ellis for his timely assist
ance that he got him appointed on the
force and he has made an excellent
officer."
An Effective Union.
Judge Ben B. Lindsey of Denver, who
has attained national fame among
criminologists from the handling of
wayward youth, street gamins and the
young flotsam of the highways and by
ways, has a fund of rare stories to tell
in connection with his dealings with
the neglected boys and girls of the
Colorado capital. It is as presiding
magistrate of the Juvenile Court that
Judge Lindsey comes in contact with
these youngsters. During his recent
visit to California his Honor poured
forth a flow of anecdote that marked
his splendid sympathy in the work of
the court. Here is one of his stories:
"We were having much trouble with
the boys in Republican alley over crap
shooting. The police made many ar
rests and I had done what I could to
check the growth of gambling, but it
seemed hopeless. One day as I was
passing the alley, I saw one of my
wards, Bennie, a newsboy, shooting
craps. I called him out of the crowd
and said to him:
" 'Bennie, I thought you told me you
would quit shooting craps."
" 'Yes, I did. Judge,' replied the
youngster, 'but you see a big fellow
came along and offered three to one
(15 cents to 5 cents) and I just couldn't
stay out.'
"We tried to substitute games for
craps," continued Judge Lindsey, "and
that failed. At last we took advantage
of the strong union sentiment "there

The Wind.
'Twas such a saucy little brook >
And had so beckoning: a look
And had a wink .so sly.
That off I follow'd where it led.
Caught by Us roguish eye.
Caught by the dimpling laugh that sped
Ever ahead, ever ahead.
Amid the grasses growing; â
And O the wind was blowing.
And O the wind was high!
It seemed to me I must chase
Korever at a charmed pace
Among the parting grasses:
Forever taunted by a sound
Of laughing-voiced lasses
Whom never any mortal found:
While all around and all around
Green grasses should be growing
And dreams be misty blowing
As a peril when it passes.
Fled is the wind I know not where:
There is a deadness in the air
And rain along the sky.
Where am I going that I run
Upon the muddy flats that lie
In squalor toward a setting sun?
Can this same pathway have begun .
Where there were grasses growing?
And O the wind was blowing.
And O the wind was high!

Paternal Watchfulness.
Secretary of War Taffs father, Al
phonso Taft, was Secretary of War be
fore him. serving with Grant in 1876.
An oil portrait of Alphonso Taft hangs
on the wall facing Secretary Taft's
desk in the War Department. T-,
When he reached his office on the
morning after the day of his swearing
in as Secretary of War Mr. Taft stood
before his father's picture and viewed
it for a long time. Then he turned to
one of his assistants.
"That's a good picture," he said.
"My good old governor certainly had
a commanding eye. I say nothing
about the comoelling force of his
hand." Then he added, his eyes
twinkling: "I am afraid I'll just natu
rally have to be Rood here, under that
steady and questioning gaze."
Honor for Washington.
Booker T. Washington, whose "Up
From Slavery" was pronounced to be
one of the notable human documents
of the nineteenth century, recently fig
ured in an Incident that gratified him
very. much. He was going North on a
train in the South, and while seated in
the. dining-car watched a group of
young men at the end of the car. He
became a little suspicious on account
of- the size of the group and their con
stant gaze. The dining-car conductor
had 'to request the young men to keep
out several times. Finally one - of the
men came' to" Mr. Washington's table
and sald_ he was one of twenty stu
dents returning to Trinity College after
the holiday recess and that all wanted
to meethiin. It will' be remembered
that the controversy over Booker Wash
ington, which started in Trinity Col-
lege, attracted national attention. Pro
fessor John Spencer Bassett of the fac
ulty declared that the head of the Tus
kegee Institute had done a notable
work. There was a fierce storm of criti
cism. Dr. Bassett was brought to trial
for his utterance. A notable victory for
academic freedom resulted.
Lettuce Prevents Disease.
Don't forget that lettuce is a pre-Â«
ventive of smallpox.
So far as it is possible for a human
being to be protected from catching
smallpox, lettuce is a protection.
No need for vaccination whatever.
Any person who eats a small quantity
of lettuce twice a day, morning and
evening, is as well protected against
smallpox as it is possible for any one
to be.
To be sure, one ought to be clean,
ought to live in ventilated rooms and
avoid dirt of all sorts. Also avoid
contact with people who have small
pox. Foolish exposure to the conta
gion of smallpox is not to be thought
of. But there is no need for vaccina
tion.
Go calmly on about your business.
Provide a small quantity of lettuce
morning and evening, and you can feel
sure that you have protected yourself
and your family in the best possible
way against smallpox.
Lettuce is one of the oldest vege
table remedies known to the medical
profession. Long before it was used
as food it was used as medicine. Many
times it haa been claimed that it has
magical or miraculous powers to pre
vent contagious disease. "We believe
this t is carrying matters altogether too
far. But lettuce does furnish to the
system exactly what is needed to pro
tect it against the poison of smallpox.
We defy any one to produce a case
of smallpox that has been contracted
by anv person who made daily use of
lettuce as a food. If there is any such
case on record, we would be glad to
hear of it. â Medical Talk.
As Plain As Day.
Nathan's teacher believed in reduc
ing poetry to diagram and visible out
line. Therefore, according to the
Boston Herald, she told the class to
make a rough illustration of the poem,
"The Old Oaken Bucket."
Xathan's illustration consisted of a
large circle; three buckets and a bunch
of dots.
"Nathan," said the teacher, "I don't
understand this. What's the circle?"
"That's the well," replied Nathan.
"And why have you three buckets?"
"One is the old oaken bucket, one is
the iron-bound bucket and the other
is the moss-covered bucket which
hung in the well."
"And what are all those little dots?"
"Those are the loved spots which
my infancy knew."

STRIKER DYING
FROM NEGLECT
Friends Say He Was Kept in
Jail Three Days on Trival
Charge and Not Given Food
Special Dispatch to Tbe Ca.ll.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 27.âAu
gust Vallet, one of the striking coal
miners of Carson County, was brought
to this city In a dying condition this
morning and placed in St. Mark's Hos
pital. His friends say that his condi
tion Is due to hardships suffered In jail
at Sunnyside.
Vallet was arrested by the guards
and jailed on a charge of vagrancy.
It is now alleged that he\was left with
out food for three days, and, that al
though the weather "was bitter cold,
he was not allowed a flre. After his
release he became 111 and rapidly grew
worse. -His friends say that Thursday
last they tried to send a messenger for
a physician to attend Vallet, but the
company guards would not permit the
messenger to pass. Vallet's friends
finally demanded a pass from the mine
superintendent so that the sufferer
could be removed. The physicians
say Vallet Is In a terrible condition.

FLA31ES GUT TWO WINGS
Conflagration Renews Agita
tion for the Transfer of
the Capitol to Milwaukee
MADISON, Wis., Feb. 27.â Trie flre
in the Wisconsin State Capitol bulld
ingr caused a loss of $800,000. The flre
involves the building of a new Capitol,
a special session of the Legislature and
the probable renewal of the agitation
in favor of the removal of the capital
from Madison to Milwaukee. The flre,
which was caused by defective electric
wiring, ruined the east and west wings,
containing the Senate and Assembly
chambers and the departments of the
Tax Commission, the Adjutant General,
Railroad Commissioner, State Superin
tendent of Schools, Superintendent of
Public Property, Board of Agriculture,
State Normal School, Commission of
Fisheries, Fish and Game Warden,
State Board of Pharmacy, State Land
Office, Dairy and Food Commission,
State Treasurer, Commissioner of La
bor, Governor, Secretary of State, State
Board of Control and Insurance Com
missioner, the Supreme Court law
library and the State Library Commis
sion.
KECOKDS IX VAULTS.
Practically all the valuable State rec
ords are believed to be safe. Most of
them remain in masonry and steel
vaults in the ruins.
Governor Schofleld maintained Insur
ance on the building throughout his
term totaling $600,000, but the last Leg
islature instituted an insurance fund
and directed the State's officers to al
lu\v the insurance policies to lapse.
In June last there lapsed $510,000, and
in December the policies for $90,000.
There is in the insurance fund at the
present time about $6000 to meet the
loss, which conservative estimates place
at $800,000. The fire practically devas
tated every portion jof the Capitol
building, with the exception of the
north -end. This was saved, but is in
such a delapidated condition that this
portion, together with the standing
walls, will have to be torn down.
LAW LIBRARY SAVED.
Governor La Follette was early on
the scene and by his coolness and self
possession did much to enforce order
among the workers. AH the contents
of the immense law library were car
ried out, together with a large quan
tity of other books and papers. The
priceless records stored in the Grand
Army room also were saved.
Chief Charles Bernard was overcome
by smoke and fell from a ladder, re
ceiving serious injuries. He is uncon
scious.
From an original cost of $60,000 in
1857 appropriations from time to time
for new additions made the cost of
the State Capitol to date about $900,000.
WILL TRADE BUFFALOES
WITH YELLOWSTONE PARK
Golden Gate Herd Is to Receive Some
Youns Animals From the Na
tional Reserve.
The Park Commissioners have ar
ranged for an exchange of buffaloes be
tween the Gcrlden Gate Park herd and
that in the Yellowstone National Park.
In June next they will receive a young
bull and a heifer from the national re
serve.
Major John Pitcher, U. S. A., super
intendent of the Yellowstone National
Park, was in the city during the week
and while here inspected the animals
at the local pleasure ground. He was
greatly pleased with the line' showing
of American wild animals and pro
nounced the buffalo 1 owned by the city
to be as good specimens as can be
found anywhere. As inbreeding, how
ever, is liable to injure the stock, he
agreed with Commissioner Reuben H.
Lloyd to furnish a pair selected from
the growing herd at the National Park,
the San Francisco Park Commission
giving up a pair of its own buffalo in
exchange.
Major Pitcher has succeeded in do
mesticating great numbers of deer and
other game at Fort Yellowstone. Dur
ing the winters the reservation is prac
tically deserted, and at this season the
superintendent has. large quantities of
feed scattered on the ground near his
own quarters. So quickly do the ani
mals learn that they are safe from
molestation that deer, elk, antelope and
even Rocky Mountain sheep, the most
shy of all American game, now come
to the park in increasing numbers
every winter, knowing that they will
find feed In abundance there and be
free from attack. The same thing is
seen in Golden Gate Park, where flocks
of mallards and other ducks feed on
the lakes in perfect confidence that
the regulations against the use of fire
arms will protect them. Major PItcKer
found the elk at the park surprisingly
tame, they coming at the call of a fa
miliar attendant.
There are now twenty-six elk â  In
Golden Gate Park, with fifteen deer of
different varieties, Including the beau
tiful Persian spotted deer; also two
antelope, nine buffalo and four kanga
roos. A young buffalo bull which the
Park Commission obtained last year
by exchange with â William F. Cody,
better known as Buffalo Bill, died soon
after reaching the park.

Bessemer Pig Iron Company
Closes Big Contract With
United States Steel Trust
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Feb. 27. â The
United States Steel Corporation to-day
closed a contract with the Bessemer
Pigiron Company for 130,000 tons of
pigirdn at $13 at the valley furnaces.
Directly and indirectly this' will em
ploy 3000 men. It will require all -the
combined output of all the furnaces in
the -Mahoning and Shenango valleys,
some of which have been idle for six
months. The price at which the pig
iron was sold is an advance of about
60 cents per. ton over the price pre
vailing in January.
Every blast furnace owned by the
United States Steel Corporation in the
Central West is now in full operation
and the material contracted for to-day
is in addition to its own output. The
feeling among steel men in this city to
day was distinctly optimistic, express
ing'the opinion that the period of de
pression experienced in some quarters
during the past several (months has
run its course and that prospects for a
season of renewed prosperity in the
iron trade are exceedingly good. The
starting up of the Mahoning and Shen
ango .Valley furnaces^ will stimulate
the demand . for coke, it is said, and
the sincle order civen by the -United
States Steel Corporation to-day will re
quire at least 130,000 tons of coke and
from 65,000 to 75,000 tons of lime
stone. The contract just closed will
result in taking the Bessemer output
out of the open market for some time
to come.
McCrea to Succeed Hawlcy.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27. â Com

go to the fifth lighthouse district as

Hawley, now .inspector of that dis

Accused Contradicts Witnesses.
BAKERSFIELD, Feb. 27. â The
taking, of evidence in the Cunningham
case was concluded to-day.. The de
fendant was on the stand all the
morning under cross-examination. He
contradicted every particle of testi
mony given by Vezie and Flory. When
he was excused the defense referred
back to portions of Vezle's deposition
and the prosecution recalled one wit
ness in rebuttal. Arguments will be
gin Monday.
Karls Is Convicted of Manslaughter.
RIVERSIDE, Feb. 27. â The Jury in

came into court at 3 o'clock this morn

EMPLOYES
QUIT WORK
Mechanics of the Southern
Pacific Company Decide
Upon Eadical 'Measures to
Enforce Their Demands
CULMINATION OF
OLD CONTROVERSY
Five Hundred Boiler-Makers
Are Out and Machinists,
Firemen and Other Work
men May Soon Join Them
The boilermakers on the entire Pa
cific sv6tem of the Southern Pacific
Company went on strike yesterday aft
ernoon as a result of the long-standing
controversy regarding general advance
in rates all alons the line. Just what
will be the extent of the strike, its du
ration or resultant effects is at present
problematical. Interested parties on
both sides speak very guardedly, but
if the rumors afloat have foundation
in fact the service of the company will
unquestionably be seriously crippled
should the strike last long.
According to the statements of the
railroad officials 500 men quite work at
3:30 yesterday afternoon. This on the
surface looks like a mere bagatelle, but
it mav reach much deeper. The men
are well organized and the employes
will undoubtedly follow the example
set by the leaders. So far as the boiler
makers in this city are concerned it
will have very little effect as the. local
repair shops do not employ many men.
MACHINISTS 3IAY GO OUT.
Associated with the boilermakers are
the ma,chjrilsts, firemen, oilers, wipers
and kindred branches of railwav em-
ployes. In the event of a bitter* con
troversy it is but natural .that these
will fall in -line- and, join -the, boiler
makers in a sympathetic strike. A ru
mor was current around this city, last
night to the effect that the machinists
have taken .action and will refuse to
return to their posts of duty. until the
trouble with the â  boilermakers is ad
justed.
Shortly after 3 o'clock vesterday. aft
ernoon H. .-. J, Small, general superin
tendent of 1 motor power, and mainte :
nance of way 'of the company, received
telegraphic, advices from'- the division
superintendentsiand master mechanics
along the railroad system "telling him
for the first "time of , the ; move, of .the
men. In ! discussing the situation Mr,
small said- â¢â¢ : - ; : .:.â¢"â  â¢ â¢ v; ; . '.v^ 1
"The trouble fiaV "been . brewing for:
some time. The Southern Pacific Com
pany has been, paying. v ithe highest
wages of i any ; raUr6Â£il *Tri: the"TJnited-
States except the Santa Fe road, which
is paying the' same wages as. our, com.-,
pany on its". '. wester^ vVrancheS: ;.â !Â«'
Tucson our boilermaktJrs fare: receiving
40 cents an hour, in. Los ".Angeles ,39.
cents and in Oakland. Sacramento and
San Francisco 36% cents.
REFUSE A COMPROMISE.
"We proposed a compromise by of
fering the men at these different points
on the road an advance of 1 cent an
hour, but they then demanded a further
increase and the matter was under ad
visement when I was informed of the
strike this afternoon. It is expected
that the balance of the boilermakers
employed by the company will go out
Monday."
The effect of the strike will be felt
mainly at Sacramento, where the com
pany has engaged in its shops 3000
men, representing scores of trades.

PAUL COWLES
WILL CONTROL
TOKIO BUREAU
JOURNALIST WHO WILL,
HANDLE NEWS FOR ASSO
CIATED PRESS AT TOKIO.
Capable Newspaper
â¢ Man Leaves for
y. Seat of War.
. : Paul Cowles, superintendent of the
Western division of the Associated
Prees, who sailed for the Orient on the
China -yesterday as a war correspond
ent, is a newspaper can with a wide
experience.
Cowies is 37 years of age and has
been in the newspaper business all his
life.- He was born in Chicago and
v.k>rked for a time on the Tribune of
ihat city, of which his father was
dramatic critic for a number of years.
When he had reached the age of 21
be came to San Francisco and became
ix reporter on the morning dailies. \
. ' Cowles spent the early part of his
newspaper career in this city, working
at intervals on the dallies and for the
Associated Press. He established a
I>aper in Santa Barbara and ran it
w'Hh success for some time, when he
sold out to get back into city news
paper life.
â  Again entering the service of the
Associated Press, Cowles rose rapidly,
having a keen news discernment, and
occupied the position of night man
ager from 1890 until 1897. when he
was appointed superintendent of the
entire Western division, including
Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands. The
work of supplying the world with the
news of the West was ably handled by
Cowles.
Cowles was sent to Honolulu dur
ing the rebellion against Queen Liliuo
kalani and faithfully and cleverly exe
cuted the duty devolving upon him,
supplying the world with the full de
tails of the trouble there.
At the outbreak of the Russian-Jap
anese war the Associated Press de
cided to enlarge its news system and
establish a bureau in Tokio, Japan.
In looking about for a capable man to
manage the office there Cowles' worth
was recognized and he was tempor
arily taken from his San Francisco of
fice to supervise the gathering and
cabling of war news from the Orient.
CowJes left on the steamer China
yesterday and will remain at the seat
of war as long as the strife lasts. E.
L. Powell, a former San Francisco
newspaper man and Associated Press
representative at Chicago, will fill
Cowles' place while he is in the Orient.

RAWHIDE MINE
STRIKES BACK
Judge Morrow Is Asked to
Enjoin Two of Tuolumne
County's Working Unions
MOB VIOLENCE ALLEGED
Sheriff Sweeney and Justice
of the Peace Opie Are
Charged With Defendants
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
was asked yesterday to interpose the
strong arm of the law in protection of
non-union miners employed or willing
to be employed by the Rawhide Mining
Company, in Tuolumne County. A peti
tion was filed by the law firm of Rior
dan, Lande & McClellan on behalf of
the Rawhide Gold Mining Company, in
corporated In West Virginia, asking
that the officers, members.' agents and
servants of the Jamestown Miners' Un
ion No. 185, Western Federation of
Miners, and the Tuolumne Union No.
73, Western Federation of Miners; Jus
tice of the Peace James Opie and Wil
liam Sweeney, Sheriff of Tuolumne
County, be forever enjoined from acts
of riot, lawlessness and anarchy, al
leged to have been perpetrated against
the property of the company and its
employes.
It is alleged that the complainant is
the owner of the Rawhide, App, Hitch
cock and Heslop mining claims, in
Tuolumne County, near Jamestown,
and that those properties are of the
combined value of $2,000,000. Among the
defendants against whom the injunc
tion is asked to issue are Charles Slo
niker. Mike Budinich, Nick Ski, Voli
Stincovich, Milan Angelich, John Jovi
covlch, C. Antonovich, Mike Bulich,
George Cattich, Theodore Stirpsvich,
Nick Mlliovich, Domingo Guttevura,
Milan Vuckovitch, D. Vuckovitch, A.
Katzun and Manuel Silva of the Tuol
umne union, and C. Treilub, Daniel
O'Toole, A. Ruflhi, H. Shoveline, L. M.
Ludovich, George Mitchovich, Anton
Charini, C. Perovich, N. Slyvocich,
Tony Kesich, Narcus Honey and Andy
Woodcock of the Jamestown Miners'
Union.
STRIKE FOR WAGES.
The complaint recites that on July
3, 1903, a scale of wages higher than
that prevailing in the mines was de
manded, and a strike was thereupon
organized against the App mine. It. is
alleged further that these unions or
ganized themselves into an unlawful
conspiracy for "the purpose of enforcing
the strike and of compelling 'the com
plainant to accept the said scale, and to
use an organized effort to " injure the
.mining business and destroy its mines
and other properties. It is averred that
by reason of such unlawful acts the
App mine has been injured already to
an extent exceeding $100,000; that the
defendants have prevented the develop
.ment and operation of the i mines by
making use of threats, intimidation,
violence and assaults, thereby causing
the employes of the company to fear
bodily injury.
The further grave averments are
made that the Tuolumne Miners' Un
ion has threatened to blow up the pipe
line which runs from a ditch to the
App mine and supplies that mine with
water, without which it cannot be op
erated at all; that both these unions
have organized themselves into large
mobs and by force oif arms have at
tacked and asaulted non-union em
ployes of the complainant and warned
them that if they persisted in the em
ployment of the complainant they
would be killed by the members of the
union. It is charged also that many
of such workmen have been bruised
and wounded by the members of the
last named union, and that such em
ployes are afraid to appear upon the
premises. Other employes are lodged
upon the premises and their meals are
served to them upon the ground by
servants of the company.
ARMED GUARDS HIRED.
It is recited that because of these
lawless acts of violence and intimida
tion the complainant has been obliged
to hire armed guards at great expense
to prevent the strikers from destroying
property and killing their workmen.
Similar allegations are made against
the Jamestown Miners' Union. It is
stated in the complaint that these un
ions and the members thereof are In
solvent and financially irresponsible;
that the complainants are expending
$25,000 per month on the mines, and
that they have been damaged already
to the extent of $500,000 by the James
town Miners' Union. " â¢ ; "" â¢
The act of the California Legislature,
approved March 30, 1903, entitled "An
act to limit the meaning of the word
conspiracy and also the- use of restrain
ing orders and injunctions" Is attacked
as unconstitutional. It is averred, that
the act deprives the complainant of its
property without due process of law,
and deprives it of the equal protection
of the laws; that it is in contravention
of articles V arid XIV of*the amend
ments to the constitution of the United
States, and is therefore null and void.
The further averment . is made that
the complainant was Invited to enter
the jurisdiction of the State of Califor
nia upon its constitutional guarantee
that it would receive the equal protec
tion of the law and have due process of
law, and in right and 'justice ought to
have and receive the same by. the gen
eral laws of the State.
It is contended that the said act does
not regulate proceedings In equity in
the courts of the United States.
Judge Morrow issued a temporary
restraining order.

CAUSES ARREST
OF LOCAL AGENT
French Wine Company Says
Joseph Campbell Has 'Not
"Accounted for His Sales
Joseph Campbell Jr., local agent for
a French champagne company, was
arrested- yesterday -on a warrant issued
at the* instigation of Thomas Dentze of
Thompson & Dentze, New York repre
sentatives of the same concern, charg
ing h>m. with felony embezzlement.
The charge grows out of Campbell's
experiences on this coast in booming a
comparatively new wine in a field long
monopolized by the wines of rival
cornpanies. Campbell came here
about eighteen months ago. He soon
realized â¢ that he had a difficult busi
ness undertaking before him and be
gan spending money with a rather lav
ish hand in order to force his wine on
the local market and' succeeded r to
some extent in accomplishing his ob
ject. Three days ago, however,
Dentze arrived here from New York
and yesterday caused Campbell's ar
rest, alleging that the local agent had
appropriated certain proceeds derived
from the sale of the . wine, which
should have been forwarded to the
main agency in New York.
Dentze, for a basis of his complaint,
cites one instance where, he claims
Campbell sold to the firm of Rathjen
& Co. $750 worth of wine, for which
he made no accounting: to the Eastern'
agents, and it is further alleged by
Dentze that Campbell is guilty of
other cases of a similar .character. In
fact he declares that nearly $9000 has
not been accounted for by the com
pany's representative in this city. â¢
When arrested yesterday Campbell
made a statement to the effect that he
is prepared to account for every bottle
of the company's wine that has passed
through his hands. In pushing the
sale of his wine on the market here
Campbell declares that it was neces
sary to distribute many bottles and
oftentimes cases of the beverage free
to consumers in order to create a pop
ular demand for it, which, he says, will
readily explain away the discrepancy
in the. stock forwarded to him. His
friends went to his rescue last evening
and furnished bonds for his release
from the City Prison..
Would Set Verdict Aside.
Attorney T. S. Mlnot filed notice yes
terday that hejvould on March 4 make
in Judge CooV~ court a motion to set
aside a verdict for $1077 given by a Jury
in that court to Stephen Otis- against
his client, John A. Walls. He claims
Walls was not rJlowed his day in court.
The verdict was the result of a sulc
to recover on a promissory note.

PRINCIPALS- IX PLAY PRE
. SENTED l BY MASK 'AND
DAGGER SOCIETY. â¢"
BERKELEY, Feb. '27.â -The second
installmenfof woman's* day; the co
educational institution for the women
of the 'University of California, came
to a -close .to-night 'with .the playing
of "The Jealous' Wife" at the Macdon
ough Theater in Oakland. ' It was pre
sented^under the auspices of. the Asso
ciated Women Students by the Mask
and Dagger- Society. In anticipation
of an, intelligent- interpretation of
George Coleman's eighteenth, century
comedy effort a large crowd filled the
theater and laughed at the antics of
the green-eyed monster.
"The Jealous Wife" was full of the
embitterments and .acrimonies of a
self-deceived, woman. She would in
sist upon a rival and she conjured one'
f rom ,t,he letter^, runaway young lady
wrote to her husband's cousin, who
carried the. husband's identical name.
As the jealous . wife Miss Eduarda
Howard gave a very faithful imitation
of a woma,n "angered ...- and -â  heart
torn from the deceit of .which she be
lieved her husband, poor Mr. Oakley,
only, too guilty. Emil Kruschke,- as
Mr. Oakley, was the picture of a hen
picked husband, shaken and hurt by
hla unreasonable virago of a consort.
THE CHARACTERS.
Augustus C. Keane, ' as the rollick
ing, advice-giving bachelor, Major
Oakley, was fully :In- the spirit of the
difficult part. Miss Tallulah Le Conte,
as Harriet Russet, the mischief-mak
ing runaway of .many, loves and ad
visers, helped .carry, off â  the honors.
The other parts were taken by John
O'Conneli; as Charles .. Oakley; Mark
Daniels, as Lord. Trinket; Frank Gil
lelen, as Mr. Russet; Howard Merrill,
as Sir Harry -Beagle; Walter- de Leon,
as Captain O'Cutter; Edwin Rust, as
John;. Miss Isabel McReynolds, * as
Lady. Freelove; "Miss Ann. Thacher, as
Toinette, and "Miss Adriane^ Lesser, as
Henriette. . v , â¢ , = v -., S'^:;c
.The play, was produced .'under the
personal. . superyision-^of Milton .-,' H.
Schwartz. Miss Martha Rice, and Miss
Portia' Ackerman composed the com
mittee of arrangements. - Music was
provided by the university orchestra,
directed, by Harding M. Kennedy..
The Association . of Collegiate
Alumnae, the California branch. of the
national organization of college grad
uate women,' met. in annual session to
day, at the.'universlty. ylt was a most
representative gathering, composed as
it ; was of 'the '. alumnae of fourteen of
the . leading colleges . of â¢ the United
States, among them Vassar, Wellesley,
RiUcliffe, Bryn Mawr and Chicago.
Naturally the alumnae 1 of Stanford
and California outnumbered the others,
and these combined to make their sis
ters welcome. The senior class women
of California assisted the California
graduates in entertaining and feasting
the visitors, and all went gowned in
the academic mortar-board. . .
EXTKItTAIX VISITORS.
The hosts of the day met their guÂ§sts
as they came off the trains this morn
ing at " Berkeley station. \They knew
them all by their college colors, which
adorned buttonholes and ' even hats.
The morning hours were spent in view
ing the sights of the campus, the Greek
Theater, the new mining buinling and
the botany building all coming In for
their share of scrutiny.' Luncheon was
served at 1 o'clock in Hearst Hall, the
guests sitting at two long tables on the
lower floor. There were 105 guests.
After the luncheon a meeting was
held in the upper hall, Miss Katherine
Chandler, president of the society, pre
siding. The address of welcome was de-
livered by* Professor Alexis Lange of
the English department of the Univer
sity ,of California. Professor Lange
spoke of tho influence of the college
bred woman upon the educating work
of ' the . university. Through her and
such organizations as the Alumnae As
sociation the; work goesÂ»oh and on. She
co-operates to keep the university mov
ing forward, keeps its children from
drifting out of touch with their alma
mater. He congratulated the associa
tion upon the selection of one of its
members to a place as instructor in the
University of -Californiaâ Miss J>#siea
Peixotto.
The address of Miss Chandler was
statistical, dealing as it did .with .the
present â¢ condition of the association.
There are now 176 graduate women of
the University of California In the as
sociation and 101 from. Stanford. -/
Miss Pelxott.9 followed- with; an ad
dress on ."The Work of the Association
of Collegiate Alumnae." She confessed
herself.' not altogether familiar with
the work of the past, and so dealt brief
ly with the duties of the various sub
committees of the association. These
she said. Indicated the. noble purposes
of the association, vwhich had set out
to carry on a noble work.

MAHONY GAINS
FIRST POINT
Judge Cook Sustains the
Demurrer to Indictment
Against Ex-County Clerk
APPEAL WILL BE TAKEN
Court Decides That Pleading
Was Insufficient, as It Did
Not Give the Particulars
The demurrer to the indictment of
the Grand Jury charging Albert' B.
Mahony,' ex-County Clerk, with pre
senting a false and fraudulent claim
for allowance to Auditor Baehr was
sustained by Judge Cook yesterday, but
it was left optional to the District At
torney to take an appeal to the Su
preme Court or to resubmit the case
to the Grand Jury.
When the case was called the Judge
said he thought he had been misin
formed as to a similar case having
been decided in the State of Washing
ten,, but he had seen nothing to alter
the opinion expressed by him last week
that the pleading was insufficient ac
cording to a decision of the United
States Supreme Court in the case of
Hess and in two cases decided by the
Supreme Court of this State in bank.
XO DIKECT ALLEGATION.
1 The indictment merely charged the
defendant with the intent to defraud
the city and county of San Francisco
in that the defendant did present for
allowance to the Auditor a certain false
and fraudulent claim fc-r allowance. It
was merely by implication that thg al
legation was made that the claim was
false. There was no direct allegation
and the indictment Just followed the
exact language of the statute. It is
an elementary principle in law that a
pleading must descend to particulars
and where the presentation of a fraud
ulent claim is charged in an Indict
ment it must stnte wherein the claim
is fraudulent.
District. Attorney Byington said he
had followed the course laid down in
the case of the people against Carolan.
'â¢That was only a department de
cision." replied the Judge. "In the
two other cases the decisions were in
bank."
CAN RESUBMIT MATTER.
, The Judge said under 1008 of
the Penal Code the District Attorney
had the power to resubmit the matter
to the Grand Jury and secure another
indictment. -â .-â â¢- . ,
j "If the matter. is resubmitted to the
Grand Jury," said Attorney George D.
Collins" for the defendant; "that would
revoke the District Attorney's right of
appeal. He cannot do both."
The Judge replied tnat he would
make the order allowing the demurrer,
but being of the opinion that the ob
jection under which it was allowed
could be avoided by a new indictment
he would direct that the matter be
resubmitted to the Grand Jury. The
District Attorney could elect what
course to take. The defendant's bail
would remain the same.
District Attorney Byington said later
that he would take an appeal to the
Supreme Court, as he was satisfied the
decision in the case of Carolan was
sound. It was a parallel case, whereas
the "other cases referred to by the
Judge were not. The fraudulent claim
in the Mahony case was for $100 for
one month's salary of A. Davidson,
copyist, and there were no particulars
that could be, explained in the Indict
ment' beyond that simple fact.
REMAINS OF WASIIBURX
CAUSE OP DAMAGE SUIT
His Daughter Sues Her Uncles Be
cause They Will N'ot Allow Her â 
to Cremate Father's Corpse.
A- suit filed yesterday by Jeanie W.
Higgins, daughter of the late A. H.
Washburn, against the Cypress Lawn
Cemetery Association and her father's
brothers, E. P. and J. S. Washburn, re
\eals a strange state of affairs. It
shows that the fair plaintiff desires to
have the remains of her father cre
mated and to place his ashes with those
of his wife in the columbarium at the
Odd . Fellows' Cemetery. Because her
uncles and the Cypress Lawn people
refuse to allow her to do as she re
quests she asks the court to award her
$25,000.
It appears from the complaint that In
October, 1903, his daughter and wife
were, too ill to arrange for the' funeral,
"rtie brothers of the deceased attended
to the matter for them and the remains
were interred in Cypress Lawn, in
which, place a lot w*as purchased out of
the funds of Washburn's estate. Last
month Mrs. Washburn died, requesting
shortly before her death that her re
mains be cremated. She also asked
Mrs. Higgins to, have the remains of
her husband disinterred and. cremated
and the ashes placed In an urn beside
hers in the Odd Fellows* columbarium.
In endeavoring to comply .with the last
wishes of her mother, says Mrs. Hig
gins, she requested permission of the*
Cypress Lawn people to remove her
father's remains. She was told by them,
she says, that her request could not be
granted unless she presented a written
consent from â¢ the brothers of the de
ceased. The consent was refused her,
greatly to her anguish, she says, and
she ask3 the court to compel them to
do as she asks and to award her $23,000
as balm for injured feelings. .
Andrew Mcttry Is Appointed.
Andrew J. Piercy.was yesterday ap
pointed administrator of the estate of
liis mother, the latt Mary-PIercy, by
Judge ;Coffey.* The petition of his
brother, Edward Piercy, that letters of
administration be granted to the Cen
tral Trust Company was denied.

main portion of the pavilion.
For its own headquarters California
Commandery will use the entire pa
vilion art gallery, 50 by 325 feet. This
will be used by the commandery for
a banquet hall.

SPORTS OF THE RUNNING TURF, THE TENNIS COURTS AND THE FIELD
JOE LESSER DOWNS NIGRETTE A HEAD
FOR HANDICAP AT OAKLAND TRACK
Celebrant, Ridden
by Spencer, Is
a Winner.
There wag an excellent attendance
at Oakland track yesterday despite the
threatening aspect of the weather.
The feature event of the card was a
$1000 handicap over one mile and fifty
yards, which was captured by Joe
Lesser, ridden by Bonner and owned
by the colored turfman, H. D. Beams.
The betting favored Kenilworth, the
top weight, though to no striking ex
tent, for the brown horse's price drift
ed back from 6 to 5 to 2 to 1. Lord
Melbourne was about as consistently
backed as any one of the five starters,
but the track was not sticky enough
for Sidney Bender's mudlark. See
went away in the lead with Kenilworth
at the start. Lord Melbourne keeping
up to the far turn and there giving up
second positron to Nigrette, the 92
pounder, with "Big Bill" Knapp in the
saddle; Soon after getting straight
ened away for the stand Nigrette
passed the favorite, and there looked
to be nothing to it but getting in line.
Now while Knapp had been indiscreet
in not saving ground, Bonner, astride
Joe Lesser, rode a very close race, and
coming with a rush at the paddock,
caught Nigrette all in, winning by a
head. The winner was 5 to 1 through
out the betting. Kenilworth finished
third.
The betting ring was crowded and
business was brisk as usual on half
holidays. Muddy tracks are responsi
ble for many hard-luck stories, and of
course a tale of apology goes with
each beaten choice yesterday, of which
there were four.
Narra G, the 7 to 5 favorite for the
first event, a five and a half-furlong
sprint, broke down hopelessly, which
left the race practically a cakewalk
for the second choice, Elliott. .The
winner was formerly owned by TV. B.
Jennings, but broke down about a year
ago and was disposed of at private
kale. Mike Daly now trains the son
of Racine, which was backed from 5
down to 13 to 5. Buxton rode Narra
G and the mare fell back before run
ning a quarter of a mile and was
pulled up. This left ooly Egyptian
Princess to beat, and Elliott, under J.
Daly's careful handling, led the niare
out six lengths at the wire. Clausus,

the speed and the others grew groggy trying: to run him down. Forest King heavily
played Diderot did not shine at his best. Hipponax outclassed.
played down from 10 to 4%. only lost
the place by a nose.
Gloomy <Jus, the lukewarm 3 to 1
favorite for the kindergarten half-mile
scramble, was much the best, but met
with all sorts of ill racing luck. Bell
rode the Burns & Waterhouse entry
and soon after the start was cut off
b>* Bob Ragon, ridden by Bonner.
Later on he had to pull up for a space
of thirty yards to avoid being carried
to the outside fence by Golden Idol.
Bonner on Ragon escaped this mud
dle and won by three lengths. Gloomy
Gus finished strong, beating out My
Order a length for the place. Sac
charate tired the last part of it,.run
ning fourth.
It was through no cleverness on the
part of Holbrook that old Pat Mor
rissey took the third, a six-furlong
selling run, for the boy tried every
way in the world to toss it off. On
form Pat looked about the best thing
of the day and his price was forced
down from 3 to 2 to 1. Pure Dale
Jumped away in the lead, followed by
Alice Carey. Both turned very wide
into the stretch and instead of saving
four or five lengths Holbrok took Pat
out, too, and waited to split the two
leaders. By chance he finally did,
scoring cleverly by a length. J. T.
Sheehan, on Pure Dale, was so inter
ested in what was transpiring behind
him that Alice Carey snapped up the
place by a nose. Goddess of Night
ran a very mild race and at 30 or 40
to 1 some day may display more speed.
Henry Spencer, "the iceman," has
not forgotten' how to put one over the
plate by any manner of means. Henry
rode the heavily played Celebrant in the
seven-furlong number for three-year
olds and. led Mike Daly's Judge out
"with something to spare. The last
named colt had a decided call in the
betting over the other starters, and no
excuses can be offered for him. Spen
cer on the winner made a nice turn
into the stretch, and at all stages of
the running held the favorite safe,
feoufriere came out of retirement and
with no vast amount of racing luck
beat Solamis for show honors. Sir
Appleby was also pinched out of his
position on the back stretch.
After, an extended vacation Forest
King faced the webbing again in the
last, a mile and seventy yard selling
event, and the Oregon horse's friends
were all down good and thick. At the
close he was equal favorite with Hain
ault. Forest King was never partial
to weight, and his 110 pounds proved
too much excess baggage. Hainault,
extremely well handled by Travers,
had the speed of the party and made a
runaway race of it. Forest King ran
second five lengths In .^advance of
Diderot.
Bonner piloted two winners.
Twenty-one bookmakers cut in.
Vanderbout, now under contract to
Dell Fountain, resembles Owen
Mounce when that rider was a boy.
Before the race Elliott showed signs
of lameness and this fact kept many
people from betting on the Racine
horse.
Mike Daly says ha will not start
Golden Idol again until he. has cured
the youngster of his habit of running

WOUNDED THUG
IS IN CUSTODY
One of the Bandits Who Was
Shot During the Fight at
Milford; Gives Himself Up
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 27. â One
of tike Callentes bandits, who precipi
tated, the battle in a San Pedro pas
senger coach at Milford at midnight,
appeared at the Milford pumphouse at
4 o'clock this morning and gave him
self up. He is fatally wounded. He
is shot through the groin and has a
bullet in his left side. { *He gave the
name of C. H. Moore. He said he had
lain close to the track since the bat
tle in the car, which resulted in the
wounding of Marshal Hickman and
an Italian passenger, whose name is
not known. The wounded bandit is
being cared for at Milford, but he can
not recover. :
- Posses are out in all directions
scourtng the country for the other
robber, who is supposed to be hiding
somewhere near by. Officers on both
ends of the San Pedro line have been
furnished his description and are
watching for him. On the person of
the robber who surrendered was found
$30. In the hold-up at Calientes last
Tuesday night about $3000 was se
cured. The officers believe that the
bandit who is still at large took his

Horse Show at Haywarcls Is
Well Attended in Spite
of Threatening Weather
EUNAWAY CAUSES PANIC
Frightened Stallion Runs
Into Group of Spectators,
Two of Whom Are Injured
HAYWARDS, Feb. 27. â Brightly
gowned women, handsome equipages
and more than 200 splendid specimens
of blooded horseflesh were the fea-
tures of K the third annual horse show
at Haywards to-day. In spite of the
threatening weather and the muddy
roads a large crowd attended the
show, people coming from Oakland,
Niles, Pleasanton and* even from San,
Jose to view the exhibit of livestock. v
At 2 o'clock the parade started from
the corner of Watkins and Castro
streets, headed by the Foresters' band,
and for several hours Shetland ponies,
driving and draught horses and fine
stallions filed â  past the reviewing
stand. The procession was headed
by C. L. Groffith's Bonnie Direct and
was divided into four classes, as fol
lows:
First division â Thoroughbreds, trot
ting stallions, mares, geldings and
colts. Second division â Draught
horses, geldings and colts. Third di
vision â Double drivers, single* drivers,
ponies and saddle horses. Fourth
division â Double carriage horses and
single carriage horses. Legrand Tur
ner of Haywards acted as grand mar
shal, and beside him as chief aid rode
little Miriam Meek, the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. W. C. Meek. The aids
to the grand ' marshal j were .Frank
Rose, Niles; -Frank Fennon, Liver
more; Charles Windier, Walnut Creek;
John Morris, San Ramon; Harold
Meek, San Lorenzo; S. Mclntosh, John
Smith and Clarence Magnes of Hay
wards. William McDonald of Liver
more acted as announcer.
But one accident occurred to mar
the pleasure of the day. A black
stallion owned by C M. Buck of Hay
wsxds and driven by his son, Harry
Buck, took fright at a fluttering news
paper near the corner of B and Cas
tro streets and dashed into the crowd
on the sidewalk, causing a wild stam
pede for safety, in which Mrs. Joseph
Olivera of Ashland and Robert Kuer
zel of Oakland were thrown down and
severely trampled by the â¢panic
stricken spectators. Miss Miriam
Meek, who was riding the little Shet
land pony, Robinson Cruso, was di
rectly in the path of the runaway, and
had a very narrow escape, the wheel
of the cart to which the big stallion
was harnessed Just grazing the pony's
side.

Civil Service Commissioner Alleges Ho
Has Violated the Law in His

The Civil Service Commission ha3
cited Auditor Baehr to appear before

alleged infractions of the civil service
rules in the employment of temporary
clerks in his office.
Baehr and the commission have had
several clashes owing to a differenca
of opinion concerning the employ
ment of temporary employes. Th*j
commission claims that by an Investi
gation of the Auditor's books a num
ber of employes engaged for tempo
rary periods were never certificated to
the commission. The commission
claims to have found further viola
tions of the civil service law, but de
clines 4o make them public until Baehr
has been heard from, declaring that
it does not desire to take snap judg
ment upon him.
Baehr's attorney, William H. Cobb,
and his chief deputy. John G. Leibert,
appeared before the Civil Service Com
mission last Thursday and were fur
nished with a copy of the findings of
the commission. They promised to file
an answer thereto by next Monday

It is said that the matter involves
the payment of several thousands of

AWARDED THE DECISION
Local Man Has HisOppohent
Groggy Several Times, but
the Latter Stars the Limit
One of the sporting surprises of the
year w as handed out last night at Sau
eaiito when Rudolph Grossman, an ob-
sccre lightv.eight pugilist from the
wilds cf Marin County, stood, up before
"Spider" Joe Welch for twenty rounds
and took a beating that would have
made an ordinary heavyweight quit.
Grossman was unable to punch and
never assumed the aggressive, so the
decision r.as Welch's by many lengths.
The engagement was the main event
cf a boxing carnival given for the ben
efit cf the Sausalito Fire Department.
Buena Vista Pavilion, where the event
took place, was racked. A large crowd
â went over from this city and the bal
ance of the attendance was made up
â¢cf sports from San Rafael, Sausalito
and way ports.
It was nearly 10 o'clock the
principals entered the ring. Welch was
in. perfect condition, while Grossman
appeared to be half dead from fright
ard. was not trained for a nstic en
counter. At the tap of the gong
Welch started after his man and kept
chasing him around the ring, landing
hard, lefts often.
Grtfssrian seemed doped, and the
spectator* were of the opinion that the
rs.ni would end in the next round.
W.â¬lch continued his rushes in the sec
: or. 3 and seemed to have Grossman in
distress. But in the third the San Ra
fael lad began to show some. All of a
sudden his face brightened and he let
go p. few at Welch that brought forth
a. round of applause from his admirers.
But his burst cf speed did not last
long, for in the fifth round Welch be
.gan to shoot In his left again. He sent
home a dozen hard Jabs. Grossman was
groggy and appeared ready to quit.
. The wige ones thought they saw the
â¢nnish of the battle, but again they
.Â»:*re doomed to disappointment. When
Welch started in to rush things in the
six-th Grossman inaugurated a style of
: clinching and protecting himself that
puzzled the Spider. Every time he tried
\o 'reach Grossman the latter would
close in and hang on till the referee
broke them apart.
Welch maintained his aggressiveness

tinuously. The strain begun to tell on

Paul Martin and Joseph Carroll
proved so evenly matched last night in
their bout, in the Olympic Athletic
Club boxing tournament, that the
judges were unable to pick a winner.
They ordered an extra round, which
did not clear up the situation between
the crack 125-pounders.
Referee Eddie Graney had the de
ciding vote, but he dodged the issue
diplomatically. He said both men were
winneri. and that each boxer was en
titled to a medal after ths brilliant
showing made. Carroll showed the ef
fects of his fast bout of the previous
evening. In the first round his blows
lacked direction, but he improved
steadily until the end. He hurt Martin
in the second round with a stiff left
uppercut. The third was a hard round,
buth men roughing it. They fought
the extra round at a fast clip, each
hoping to show a shade the better of
the fighting. Referee Graney's deci
sion of a tie was a popular one.
The programme opened with a sensa
tional fight between AI Young and
William Wolff, two welter-weights.
They fought desperately for three
rounds, and the Judges ordered an
extra round. Wolff put on a full head
of steam and grained the verdict. Young
started to rough it in the first round
and earned the displeasure of the spec
tator?. They seemed with Wolff to a
man from that time on. When the lat
ter outgamed Young at these tactics
later on the spectators cheered him.
The house was in an uproar in the
fourth round, when Young was hang
in? on after a slugging match. Just
as the bell rang he was staggered with
a right to the head.
Robert Lundie was given the decision
over R.obert Cairns after four hard
fought rounds. Lundie was after his
man throughout, and proved the
cleaner hitter of the pair. He came up
the fresher fcr the fourth round and

down. The bark ran close by, and the
steamer put up a red flag, which Cap
tain England thinks had an "S" in the
center. This is supposed to be the
Dollar sign, which is the insignia, of
the Dollar line of steamships.
From Captain England's descrip
tion of the schooner, she is supposed to
be the Rival, which sailed from Shoal
v.-ater bay yesterday. She was under
sail ar_d her engines were not working.
About an hour after sighting the dis
abled craft the Thistle sighted a larger
steam schooner, probably the Aberdeen.
Captain England sispaled the position
of the disabled vessel and the Aberdeen
will probably order the necessary as
sistance.
A dispatch just received from Tilla
tr.ook says a steamer is sending up dis
tress signals off the heads.

points.
Harry Chester plucked victory from
what seemed utter defeat in the light
heavy-weight class. He met Frank
Smith, who had all the best of the
first round. He knocked Chester down
with a straight right to the head and
repeated this early in the second
round. This roused Chester to action
and he had Smith beaten before the
end of the round. He outgamed him
in the third round and gained a popu
lar victory. x
Sam Berger had an easy time in the
heavy-weight class. He quickly out
feinted Jack Sullivan and knocked him
down three times in the first round,
punishing him severely about the
body. Referee. Graney then stopped
the unequal battle and gave the deci
sion in Berger's favor.
The referee also stopped the bout
between Tom McGreal and Al Young
in the middle-weight class. It was
Young's second appearance and aa he
was being severely punished Graney
thought best to stop it. Both boxers
were using rough tactics.
George Finnegan, the bantam cham
pion, knocked Jack Lenahan down
three times In the first round and then
Eddie Graney stopped proceedings.
Finnegan is a sturdy little fellow, with
tremendous hitting powers. Lenahan.
who is a slim slip of a boy, seemed the
most popular boxer in the tournament.
When he fills out he will take some
stopping.
Harry Tenny punished Eddie Car
roll severely in the final bout in the
feather-weight class. Carroll was
knocked down several times, but
bounded up like a rubber ball. He
proved game and was still full of fight
at the end of the third round.
The tournament was a marked suc
cess in every particular. There were
a number of sensational bouts each
evening. The big gymnasium was
packed to its capacity last night and
the spectators applauded each fine bit
of work.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
CORSET DISPUTE
PUZZLES COURT
Justice Tappan Listens to
Testimony Given by Stout
Women and Lighter Ones
REACHES NO DECISION
Continues Hearing of Case
That More Feminine Ex
perts May Be Examined
ALAMEDA Feb. 27. â Corpulent
forms and corsets that wouldn't fit
vere exploited at length during the
testimony taken to-day by City Jus
tice TL B. Tappan In the case of Mrs.
S. E. Eibes. a maker of corsets,
s gainst Mrs. Francis Blanchard to re
rover $7 Â£0 fcr a corset built for the
last named, but which ehe refused
to accept, claiming that It was not
constructed according to the plans and
Fpeciflcations agreed upon, and that it
would prove a "death trap" if she got
- -
into it.
It w*s brought out in the hearing
that tbe defendant weighed 215 pounds,
and that It was necessary for her to
have her corsets constructed to order
to better insure comfort to the wearer
s cd improve the appearance of her
form.
"When I first received this corset,"
testified Mrs. Blanchard, as she held
up the article so that the court could
eee it. "I knew right away that it was
rot made cs I had ordered it. There
â was no rubber band at the bottom and
the "spoons' were too close together. It
would have been a death trap for me
if I put it on, and I am satisfied that
I can buy a corset for 51 50 that would
fit my form better and afford me more
comfort than this one."
"Why, I have supplied the same pat
trrn of corsets to a number of fat
â¢women living on San Antonio avenue,
and they have all been' pleased with
them," said Mrs. Eibes in replying to
Mrs. Blanohard s statement. "At the
#nd of a year's wear these women have
bee,n. greatly reduced and are nice. and
Fhapely. The reason for putting on
rubber bands at the lower part of the
t onset is to compress the hips and im
prove the contuor of the waist. We
never put on these bands unless or
dered, as we find that the corset can
be compressed enough by tight lacing."
Mrs. L. B. McClure, a friend of Mrs.
Blanchard, and who. acknowledged
that she wor* corsets and was quali
fied to tell a comfortable one when she
taw it. was called to the stand and
caid:
"I saw the corset in dispute before
Mrs. Blanchard received it and said to
Mrs. W. M. Thompson. "Mrs. Blanch;
ard will never put that on, as It is not
comfortable for a woman of her
After listening to further testimony

O. G." Hoaton for the plaintiff. Justice
Tappan remarked:
"Well, there is more in these corset
cases than I over expected to find. 1
am unable to decide yet whether this
corset, was made as ordered or whether
5t will tit Mrs. Blanchard comfortably.
1 will continue the matter until next
Thursday for the purpose of securing
additional expert testimony."

A. Havemeyer Denounces
Special Policeman Hitch
cock's Action for Damages
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadwav, Feb. 27.
There Is going to be a fight before
Special Policeman Hitchcock suc
ceeds In separating W. A. Havemeyer
from $25,000 or any part 6f the same
through the action begun In the
courts here yesterday, in which Hitch
cock asks that amount for alleged
slander. Hitchcock alleges that Have
meyer called him a thief in the pres
ence of witnesses and has slandered
him to such an extent that he has se
riously Injured his reputation. His
opponents state that Hitchcock, im
pressed with the'name of Havemeyer
and the amount of coin supposed to
be stacked up behind the nephew of
the great New York sugar king, is at
tempting a hold-up. Two of the best
known attorneys in this city have been
employed by the opposing parties and
it is believed that a three-ringed cir
cus tent would not cover the ground
to be torn up in the coming scrlm-
Havemeyer himself will say very lit
tle in regard to the matter and will
undertake no explanation in regard
to the occurrence that was the cause
of the hostilities. In an interview this
evening he said: "I do not care to
talk about the matter. I have em
ployed George. W. Reed as my attor
ney and outside of what he may wish
to make public I have nothing to say,"
"Would you. mind saying whether
you ever had any| trouble with Police
man Hitchcock?" was asked.
VI . do not care to state," was the
reply. I -. . -"â¢".;
, "Do you employ Hitchcock to patrol
your premises?" { .:-\}\- ... .-,.â¢''..
"He patrols in ; front of them," an
swered Havemeyer.
Attorney Reed, when asked in re
gard to the matter, said: 'â¢ "What my
client said to. Mr. Hitchcock he is
willing to stand for. What he said he
supposed he was saying to him as
man to man. Hitchcock says in his
complaint that he,- was called a thief
in the presence of G. M. Burnham
and Thomas O'Donnell. All that oc
curred took place at the residence of
Mr. Havemeyer at 173 Santa Rosa
avenue. If .those witnesses were there
my client kiiows nothing about it and
the men must have been hidden in
the shrubbery. What -one man says
to another is not libel. In this case
it looks like a hold-up." â¢ â¢â  *'

BARD CARRIES THE DAY
Clause in the Agricultural
Appropriation Bill Threat
ens Life of the College
Berkeley Office San, Francisco Call,
2118 Center Street, Feb. 27.
Through the rejection by the Senate
in Washington yesterday of the
clause in the agricultural ap
propriation bill practically hand
ing over to the Secretary of Ag
riculture supreme control of the agri
cultural stations, the allied-agricultur
al stations of the country, won their
first brush with Secretary James Wil
son. The news was received with un
disguised satisfaction at the Univer
sity of California, as it was fully
recognized there that the agricultural
college had had a narrow escape from
being absorbed by the United States
Department of Agriculture.
The objectionable clause is an in
nocently couched thing that would de
ceive any one "riot" familiar with the
legislative coast. Apparently it would
eimply assist in systematizing the ag
ricultural investigations qf the coun
try, but in reality it would give the
Secretary of Agriculture absolute con
trol of the stations. It reads:
"The Secretary of Agriculture Is
hereby authorized and directed to co
ordinate the work of the several sta
tions with the Department of Agri
culture, to the end of preventipg un
necessary duplication of work, . of In
creaplns the efficiency of the stations
and the Department' of Agriculture,
and to unify and systematize agricul
tural investigations, in the United
States." ;'fv.:', f; : * ;^;.'
' The heads tof the stations everywhere
took up arms against this measure and
fought it* bitterly.' Professor E. W.
Hilgard of the department
of the university did his share of the
work by addressing Senators-Bard and
Perkins, and if was Senator Bard who
succeeded â¢' irv-' haviiig' the clause
stricken out yesterday. â * " ; ' â¢:
Skid' Dr. Hilfcard to-day: .
"I, suppose .now that. .Secretary Wil-
son will oppose .the Adams bill now
pending before tli^ Hotlse.' .It calls for
an increase in the 'â¢ appropriation ; for
agricultural stations from.; $15,000 to
53O'OOO." ' "--â â -. ' f. ~?:\ ; . :; -
The Adams bill is receiving the sup
port of agriculturists allore'r the" "Unit
ed States, but it is likely to die a
natural death, as -influences are at
work, so Dr.'HHgard says, that will
prevent it ever reaching the Senate. v "

INITIAL STEP
TOWARD RELIEF
Judge Hall Recommits Ten
Patients to the Home for
FeebleMinded at Glen Ellen
HARMLESSLY INSANE
System of Handling Those
Mildly Deranged Will Be
Improved by Lunacy Board
Oakland Office San 'Francisco Call,
6, -Hill 8 Broadway, Feb. 27.
The second step in the move to clear
the State Hospitals for the Insane of
all those patients which can be classed
as the harmless insane and put the en
tire system of committing patients to
these institutions on a better basis
was taken this evening, when Judge S.
P. Hall made an order recommitting
ten patients from this county to the
Feeble-Minded Home at Glen Ellen.
In explanation of this action Attor
ney John W. Stetson of the State
Board of Lunacy Commissioners said
in an interview:
â¢'According to the law-prior to 1898
it was not made compulsory for coun
ties to bear the expense of the patients
sent to the State asylums. Things
have become very' much tangled and
the Lunacy Commissioners are making
a move to putthe entire system on a
better basis. To this end those pa
tients sent from Alameda County to
the Cleft Ellen Home prior to the pas
sage of the recent law were recom
mitted to that hospital to-day. From
now oh the State will collect $10 a
month from this county for the pa
tients sent to the home. This proce
dure will be pursued with every coun
ty in the State. :
"Much criticism has been expended
upon the method of conducting these
institutions and it is purposed to do
away with much of the ground . for
complaint. In the first place the num
ber of harmless insane in these hospi
tals runs up into the hundreds. The
State asylums are not for such as
these. Then there are a great many
free patients whose families are well
able to pay for their support. The
State! intends hereafter to collect for
these patients from the counties from
which they came, and it wiir be up to
the county officers to get the money
for their' support from the family of
the ositlent. Â£ 'â 
" y'This is only the beginning of a gen
er.il movement which will extend all
over the' State. 'â  The commission be
lieves that the State asylums are large
\Â«riough to accommodate all the; pa
tients that it is necessary to' confine,
Ibut there is to be a general weeding
"out of the harmless ones, whose
â¢ proper home is. the poor farm';". -.
Â£>".The necessary order made by Judge
Hall. was the outcome of a conference
between him. Superintendent -'Dawson
of the Glen Eljen Home for Feeble
minded Children and Attorney Stetson
Of the Lunacy Board.
LONGSHOREMEN ARE

OAKLAND, Feb. 27. â The long

Shore Lumber companies' yards, but

lers' Union.
There is a possibility that the strike
may be settled to-morrow morning,
as a committee from the Building

mittee from the Federated Trades
Council and an attempt will be made
to arbitrate the ' differences between
the Lumber Clerks' Union and the

MAT TRANSFER
BENSON CASES
Representatives of Govern
ment Favor Suggestion of
the Defendant's Counsel
WILL RE CONVENIENCE
Accused Offers to .Surrender
to California Authorities
and Have Hearing Here
NEW YORK, Feb. 27. â The exami
nation of John A. Benson, charged by
the. Government with . bribing P.. A.
Harlan and S. A. Volk, clerks In the
Land Office at Washington,-, was .con
cluded to-day and a motion was made
by the counsel for the accused to dis
miss the charge. This motion was
based upon the evidence of Harlan
and Volk, both of whom testified that
the money Benson paid them had. been
for work and services rendered him in
1899 and not to divulge the result of
an examination made by the Land Of
fice of Benson's method of securing
titles to California and Oregon school
lands, as alleged by the Government.
United States Commissioner Shields
said in view of the evidence he would
read over the testimony and render a
decision later.
Evidence was taken on the second
charge, wherein Benson was charged,
together with Frederick A. Hyde of
San Francisco, with having conspired
to defraud the Government in securing
titles to school lands. Benson placed
in evidence his contract with Hyde
concerning the lands in question,
showing that Hyde had secured title
to the school lands before Benson be
came interested in the deal and that
Benson was only to profit through the
sale of the property.
Judge Campbell, representing the
accused, said that in view of the fact
that all of the Government's witnesses
were in California, it would be more
convenient for all concerned if the ex
amination were held there and offered
to surrender Benson to the California
authorities and then have the exami
nation in that State. Those represent
ing the Government said the sugges
tion would be acceptable and adjourn
ment- was taken until Tuesday to af
ford time to consult with the Wash
ington authorities. ,

JUDGMENT GOES AGAINST â¢ .
. - - PO1JCE.MAN IN LIBEL SUIT
Judge. Daniels Finds for Defendant,
Who Accused Peter Whnlen of Not
Paring Ufa Bills.
Justice of the Peace Daniels has
given judgment in favor of John Gue
tersloh, who was sued for libel by
Peter Whalen, a police officer. The
testimony disclosed that Guetersloh,
who keeps a grocery at 1632 Baker
street, accuscO Whalen publicly of not
paying his grocery bill. The accusa
tion was the culmination of a trouble
which involved Gutersloh's trial before
the Police Commission on the alleged
charge of selling liquors to minors.
Gueter3loh was cleared of the
charge, but blamed Whalen for his
trouble and stated at the time that if
he had a gun he would "finish"
Whalen. / Judge Daniels was con
strained to give judgment to Gueter
sloh in the libel suit because no evi
dence was adduced that Whalen had
paid the grocery bill, so Guetersloh's
assertion was apparently true.

Admiral Walker Tells the
President Large Force Is
Xot Wanted on Isthmus
OPINION HAS WEIGHT
Xaval Officer Thinks Three
or Four Hunflred Men Are
Enough for Present Needs
WASHINGTON*, Feb. 27.â Admiral
Walker, who will be president of the
new Panama Canal Commission, does
not approve cf the immediate use of j
United States regular troops on the |
isthmus. He has told the President
that three or four hundred marines |
"Brill serve all present needs in that j
quarter. He thinks it -will take six )
years to build the canaL His eptnion
may affect the orders to the Third In
fantry to proceed to the isthmus of I
Panama. I
Lieutenant General Chaff ee had a-- j
Iected that regiment to relieve the ma- (
rinea on the isthmus at the instance i
of the Navy Department. But that re- J
quest iva3 based on the suspicion that
it would be necessary to continue the j
for<:e on the isthmu3 at its present j
strength of about 10<)0 men. The ma- j
Tines xvere wanted elsewhere â some at j
Guantar.amo and some In the Philip- j
pinesâ and the department could not j
spare the 1400 men ivho had been guard- :
ing the line of the Panama Railroad. !
but when the demand for j^uards was J
reduced to 400 this could be granted, ;
and the War Department rvas so In- \
formed. The Third Infantry had been i
notified to be in readiness for service ;
on the isthmus, but final orders had j
not been given.
This is the present situation. The ;
Third stands ready to 50 to Panama j
whenever troops are required there. !

I Mrs. Hughson, of Chicago, whose I
letter follows, is another woman in high
position who owes her health to the use of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
"Dear Mr?. Pixxham: â I suffered for several years with general
weakness and bearing -down pains, caused by womb trouble. My appe-
tite was fitful, I would lie awake for hours, and could not sleep,
until I seemed more weary in the morning than when I retired. After
reading one of your advertisements I decided to try the merits of Lydia
E. Pinkhain's Vegetable Compound, and I am so glad I did. No one
can describe the good it did me. I took three bottles faithfully, and
besides building up my general health, it drove all disease and poison
out of my body, and made me feel as spry and active as a young girl.
Mrs. Pinkham's medicines are certainly all they are claimed to be. â
Mns. M. E. Huohsok, 347 East Ohio St, Chicago, I1L
Mrs. Pinkham Tells How Ordinary Tasks Produce Displacements.
Apparently trifling incidents in woman's daily life frequently produce
displacements of the womb. A Blip on the stairs, lifting during menstruation,
standing at a counter, running a Bevring machine, or attending to the most
ordinary tasks niv result in displacement, and a train of serious evils is started.
The first indication of such trouble should be the signal for quick action.
Don't let the condition become chronic through neglect or a mistaken idea
that you can overcome it by exercise or leaving it alone. _ .
More than a million women have regained health by'the use of Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
If the slightest trouble appears which you do not understand
write to 3Irs. Pinkham, at Lvnn, for her advice, and a f exr
timely words from her will show you the right thing to do. This
advice costs you nothing, but it may mean life or happiness or both*

Has Successful Trial Trip.
The new steam schooner Shasta,
which was built at Grays Harbor for
the E. K. Wood Lumber Company and
engined at the Fulton Iron Works, had
her official trial trip yesterday, and
proved as good as required by the spec
ifications under which she was built.
With a large party on board and pilot
ed by Captain Hansen, who is to com
mand her, the Shasta was put through
her paces in the stretch of water in the
vicinity of Red Rock and then taken
outside the heads. She made an aver
age speed of 9.75 knots, and in the
rough water beyond the Golden Gate
showed herself a good sea boat.
Only those, with seasoned stomachs
enjoyed the test for seaworthiness.
Abraham Marks, who at his post of
duty at the Merchants' Exchange
knows all about ships and everything
else nautical, said afterward:
"When, we' first' got" outside I, was
afra)d the big seas would swamp and
sink the schooner. A few minutes later,
however, I was afraid they wouldn't.
Guess I was bilious." <â  -;.-1>i
The Shasta was built for the trade
between' here and Puget Sound ports,
and will run in connection- with the
Olympia. She will have, a capacity for
500,000 feet of lumber and accommoda
tions for thirty' passengers.

GRAHAM CONCERT
A BRILLIANT AFFAIR
How happy Donald Graham must
have been last nightJ If he wasn'tâ
but, of course, he was, because frienda
âthe dearest possession that falls to
the lot of mortal manâ had come to do
him honor. And they came in twos,
threes, scores, hundreds, until Steinway
Hall was groaning with its weight of
pretty women and their men folk.
When before was the hall tilled upon
to house so many? Seats and aisles
were pre-empted regardless of conven
tions, and it was deemed a pity that
the Pavilion had not been pressed into
service.
Such a concert audience! With hats,
without hats, semi-toilettes and tailor
gowns, tuxedos and office clothesâ these
made up a motley but such an appre
ciative audience. What would the
Newport people say of our provincial
concert clothes? 'Tis lucky we're so far
away.
The programme was a gemâ rather a
string of gems. Herewith is the string
as presented on the printed programme,
but it sadly omits the sweetest, mel

Senator Bard Writes That He
Does Not Intend to Make
Any Effort to Be Ke-elected
SpÂ«dal Dispatch to The Call,
VENTURA, Feb. 27.â The Free Press,
recognized as Senator Bard's official
organ, this evening printed a letter
from Senator Bard, defining his Sena
torial ambitions. Extracts from his
letter is as follows:
"Your inquiry is whether I desire a
re-election, but I must first" say that
my wishes ought really to have very
little consideration in the matter. From
my standpoint I have nothing to do
with it. After my four years', service
the people of the State are the best
judges whether my experience is an
asset worth saving to the State.
"I am not intending to challenge
any one to a contest. I am intending
only to state that I do not offer my
self as a candidate for re-election. I
will not therefore make any effort to
be re-elected and will not accept the
honor of a re-election unless it comes
withoutsolicitationonmypart. Wheth
er this attitude can be .practically
dealt with I leave to you and other
friends to decide. To' a politician like
yourself I am quite sure that my po
sition, while recognized as theoretic
jilly correct, will appear to be unten
able if I expect to be re-elected, but
my expectations do not enter into the
discussion. I do not anticipate what
the Legislature may, do. I will do
nothing myself to influence any of its
members in the matter. If it should
elect me I shall consider it a com
mendation, of course.
"And so all this is to be summed
up by the statement that only in the
event that public sentiment should be
so pronounced in favor of my re-elec
tion tha| the honor shall be. tendered
to me substantially as it was before,
do I desire to be considered as a can
didate."
THINK BOSSLER
WAS MURDERED
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 27.â The almost
lifeless body of J. G.. Bossier of Seattle
was found in a corral on Wilmington
street Thursday morning. His throat
had been cut, the tracf a being severed
in such a manner that he could not
speak. Near him was a bloody razor.
The man died at the Receiving Hos
pital an hour after he was found with
out having been able to indicate the
cause of the wound which caused his
death. The Coroner's investigation re
sulted in* a verdict of suicide, and the
case was supposed to have been closed,
but to-day the detectiv'es took into cus
tody James Morris on suspicion that
he had murdered .Bossier. The officers
had been working on the murder the
ory from the beginning, and without
telling their suspicions to .the Coroner
permitted the* inquest to be held.' ]' â 
After the arrest of Morris â  it ; was
learned that the detectives had been
informed that Morris and Bossier and
another man had been engaged in some
criminal transaction, in which Bossier
got all the booty. He tried to hold out
a portion of it and a quarrel' followed.
Bossier was seated on a truck and the
officers expect to prove that- Morris
drew a razor and threatened him .with
death unless he gave up a portion of
the money. Bossier laughed at the
threat. This so enraged Morris that he
is said to have slashed Bossler's throat
with the razor, and then, after search
ing him, left hint dying on the- ground.
By the time the man was found it
was impossible for him to make any
statement It is known that he had
money when he left his room, .but no
money was found on his body.
Morris is a notorious character.' He
is an opium, flend. .. He has been, In
trouble.. with the police many times.
He is supected of knowing much about
various highway robberies which have
been committed in this city during the
past several month*' â â¢ â

Then came the night's hero â and he

said Donald Graham had lost his voice,
but if he had, he found it last night.
His last rendition left a sweet note

ISLANDS NEED
TRAIN SERVICE
The Administration Believes
With Taft That Eailroads
Will Benefit Philippines
WASHINGTON. Feb. 27.âLegisla
tion authorizing the Philippine Gov
ernment to execute a guarantee of 4
per cent per annum on $40,000,000 of
bonds for railroad construction in
those islands is to be introduced in
the House next week by Chairman
Cooper Of the. House Committee on In
sular Affairs. This legislation will have
the support of the administration
through Secretary Taft, whose con
viction that railroads are the next
most essential step in the development
of the- Philippine Islands has been
made known to the Committee on In
sular Affairs. Secretary Taft, Chair
man Cooper and Colonel C. A. Edward,
chlet of the Insular Bureau of the War
Department, were in consultation to
day at' the' War Department and later
at,th,e Capitol. . . .
While the text of the proposed leg
islation has not been prepared, its ver
biage will be most simple and contain
the authorization to the Philippine
Government to issue the guarantee on
the capital to be invested in railroad
building. A restriction will be placed
in tho legislation limiting" the guaran
tee to American or Filipino capital.
The first roads to be built will be in
the island oÂ£ Luzon. Some sections of.
the island, according to the belief of
Secretary Taft. will yield 4 per cent
from the beginning.
Other sections where railroads would
lead to the greater industrial develop
ment will not earn this amount on the
investment. At the most, however, it
is estimated that the Government
guarantee will only be needed for a
limited number of years. The strictest
kind of safeguards are to be embodied
in the legislation looking to an abso
lute accounting to Government repre
sentatives.
The plan, as at first outlined, pro
vided for a 3 per cent guarantee on a
total investment of $60,000,000. Upon
further consideration of the matter, it
was deemed advisable to reduce the
total amount to $40,000,000, and raise
the guarantee to 4 per cent. Should
the total amount of the guarantee be
balled for it would mean a total yearly
expenditure of $1,600,000.
It is predicted that telegraph lines
will follow the - railroad, newspapers
will be established along its lines, and
the educational, social and industrial
developments of the islands will be ac
complished faster and. more surely
than in any other manner.

OUTLINE BRIGHT FUTURE
FOR POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL
Trustees Adopt Resolutions That
Scope of Institution Shall Be Broad
and CourÂ«cs Thorough.

decided that the next school year be
divided into three terms of twelve
weeks each, the first from September
15 to December 15, the second from
January 1 to March 1 and the third
from April 1 to June 20.
Trustee John introduced the follow

board to use every effort to make the California
Polytechnic School a useful Institution for the
young people of California, to the end that It
shall ultimately afford Instruction alone me

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL', SUNDAY. FEBRUARY .28, 1904.
BREWERS OFFER
HANDSOME SUM
Give Solid Aid to the City
Project to Have Building
and Exhibit at St. Louis
SUBSCRIPTIONS TO DATE
List of Those AVlio Put Their
Hands in Pockets for Coin
Needed to Insure Success
i The Brewers' Protective Association
> has given $1500 to the fund for a San
j Francisco building and exhibit at the
j St. Louis Exposition. 'The Southern Pa
i cine Company has pledged $1000 and
; the Bank of California $500. This en
courages the committee of fifty to hope
that the entire amount will be forth
coining within the next month. When
ihe fact is known th;k the whole sum
must be subscribed by April 1 in order
that contracts may be let in time, those
intending to contribute will appreciate
the need of haste.
San Francisco has undertaken
through mercantile organizations to
iai?e Â£50,000 for the special building and
display, and the city's financial re
' sources and public spirit will be judged
j largely by the success or failure that
I attends the effort. No better advertis
i ing venture has ever been proposed for
| any city, and, properly carried out. San
j Francisco should feel its benefits in the
I shape of added material prosperity for
i years to come.
\ The Board of Supervisors has consid
â  eied the mater of sufficient importance
I tÂ« pledge $15,000 of the municipal reve
j nUe to the purpose, and the rest must
| come from private sources. A list of
j the larger subscriptions received to
| date is as follows:

AMERICAN INVENTOR
Achieves Phenomenal Suc
cess in Making a Diamond
of Wonderful Brilliancy
Dealers in precious stones will try
to prevent the manufacture and sale
of a wonderful gem that will revolu
tionize the sale of the real diamond the
world over.
Thi? recent production has brought
additional famo to a brilliant Ameri
can who, after many experiments and
great expense, has produced a gem of
amazing hardness and luster. Even ex
perts are helpless and at a less to ac
count for its wonderful hardness and
splendor.
What effect this gem will have upon
the price of the genuine is watched
with considerable interest, as the vast
difference in valuation, together with
the similarity of the newly Improved
sapph-diamond, which so closely re
sembles the real as to^defy detection,
makes the ultimate outcome problemat
ical.
This gem is an exhibition at David
son's Palace, 124 Kearny street, and it
requires no artificial lights whatever
to demonstrate its striking beauty and
wonderful display of brilliancy.
The inventor will not permit -his gems
to ba sold except in his own palaces,
which are under his direction, fearing
that some .unscrupulous dealer would
substitute an imitation or represent this
newly improved sapph-diamond to be
the genuine.

The block Is exceptionally handsome and 1% j
level. The streets are graded, macadamized i
and sewered, and everything ready for the I
builder. A new- feature has been inaugurated
in the sale of this property in the enforcement
of the following restrictions, which are made
for the protection of all and which, we have
no doubt, will add much to the value of Ihe (
land and be appreciated by all real home seek- f
ers. ]
No lot will be sold for any but residence
properties, including not more than two flats, j
No stores, churches, stables, coal yards or 1
any objectionable buildings. Th* manner o! j
enforcing thesÂ» restrictions will be explained â¢
fullv at our office.
The Idea is to make it possible for you tr> huv |
a lot and bulld-a home without being ruined
oa damaged by^nelj:hbor!ng buildings. Thou- ;
sands of people in this city who have built de-
sirable homes have had them ruined hy threÂ«- 1
stcry flats, store?, coal yards, etc. Owing t->
the restrictions and the large lots, this block
will lie built un Into select residence property
and become very valuable.
It will pay you to buy a large lot Instead cf j
a 25-foot lot, as you can save thÂ» price of the 1
extra land In the cost of your building: and be-
sides this secure an abundance of light and j
sun and build a more artistic home.
Our agent will be on the block Sunday with
diagram, or you may call at our office for
more complete Information. But take our ad-
vice and see the property Â»t once.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 27. â The big slump in wheat
came shortly before the close. The opening
was weak on lower cables,' both English and
Continental markets showing losses. May was
i^c lower to %c higher at $1 O4Â»4 to $1 C'5Â»-4.
and July was off He to " 8 c at 95Â«4c to96?Â»c. â¢
During the tlrst few minutes of trading the
leading Ions Interest was an open . seller of
the May delivery. Local professionals also
took the selling side. In consequence May
declined to $1 04, but the July option held
comparatively steady around 96c after touch
inr 9U%c early in the trading. A noticeable
feature in the early situation was the absence
of any influential buying. ' The market lacked
its usual eupport. the reinstatement of big j
lines previously sold out. The seeming reason
was that most of the large traders were dis
posed to await, developments over Sunday. An
other factor in discouraging general buying
early was for the purpose of enabling the pur
chase of July wheat at lower prices. '1 the
session was nearing the close there was a sud
den outbreak of spectacular selling of May.
The heavy orders were generally supposed to
be for the account of the principal long. The
general selling movement thus suddenly inaUR
urated resulted quickly in a severe slump in
the price of the May option. From around
Kl 05 May dropped to $1 01%. Many stop-lo<a
orders came out, accelerating the decline. On
a partial cessation of the selling a large por
tion of the loss was recovered within the last
few minute? of trading. Closing figures on
May showed a net loss for the day of lV4c at
$1 03%. July was down y,c at l)(i%c.
Lower cables and weakness In wheat caused
an easier feeling In corn. May clfieed Vrc
lower at 56&c. July dosed a shade lower at
5oV 4 fi55ty(C.
The feature in oats vae the comparative
Ftreri_-th of the market In the face of the
weakness In wheat. May closed V4c lower at
45V4c. July closed He lower at 41TÂ£c.
In provisions trading centered in pork. Lr>cal
packers were the principal buyers. There was
liberal liquidation of May pork late in the
ression. May pork closed at a loss of 27%c,
lard was off 7%c and ribs were down 5c.

There was an active market for all de

receipts are large prices are likely to advance.
A car of Western falls due toÂ»morrow. There
were 1:0 dressed Turkeys received yesterday.
Receipts of Game were light, but as the de

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There wae ho further decline- in Butter except
a shading in dairy, but the market was weak
and dull, with large stocks. Dealers are under
the Impression that some shipments are now
possible and are accordingly wiring In quest of
orders without definite results thus far.

The Egg market continues to decline. Stocks
are enormous and steadily increasing. Dealers
are predicting all sorts of low quotations for

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The cloudy, threatening weather continued
to txert a depressing influence upon the market
for fresh fruits, particularly In the Citrus
department. There was some little activity
during the early trade caused by thÂ» extra de
mand for cheap Oranges among small' retailers
and peddlers for the Sunday trade, but trading
was conlined almost entirely to the filling of
small orders. The large stzes of fancy Navels
were still firmly held, but the demand for such
fruit was of a hand-to-mouth character. Mexi
can Limes wore closely cleaned up and firm,
but all other Citrus fruits were plentiful and
weak. The managers of the auction company
announce that five cars of Navels are at hand
for to-morrow's auction and lour more are re
ported due.
Stocks of common Auples wers steadily ac
cumulating and were offered freely at lower
prices. Medium and fancy grades were rather
dull, but firmly held. -Ripe Bananas were
abundant and met with a light demand.
