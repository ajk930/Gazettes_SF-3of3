REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IS FAST SPREADING
THROUGHOUT THE VAST DOMAINS OF THE CZAR
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 24, 7:30 A. M.--The revolutionary movement is extending to air parts of the empire. There
is no* longer room for doubt that it was carefully planned and has for its object -the overthrow of the Romanoff
dynasty. The strikers are merely the catspaws of a powerful political organization. Moscow and other cities report
risings of the laboring classes in answer to a general call. It is said the Czar has determined to thrust aside his
present advisers and meet the labor representatives. Only minor riots have occurred heae in the last twenty-four hours.
WORKINGMEN IN MANY CITIES HEED CALL FOR GENERAL RISING
BLOOD MAY FLOW
IN CITY OF MOSCOW
Repetition of St. Petersburg
Riots Expected in the
Ancient Capital.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23â The most startling feature
in the situation to-night is the news that several factories in Mos
cow have closed and that the workmen in the old capital of Rus
sia are repeating the tactics of their fellow workmen of the new
capital, marching from shop to shop and mill to mill, demanding
that the establishments be shut down. The whole city is reported
to be in a state of grreat excitement over the news of the bloodshed
here yesterday, which has precipitated the strike that had been
Scheduled for Wednesday. Moscow has more workmen and less
troops than St. Petersburg, and, besides, is just now the heart of
the Liberal movement, and the danger of bloodier occurrences
there than have been witnessed here are proportionately greater.
A rising in Moscow is also more likely to have greater results, in
dustrially politically, than that of St. Petersburg.
MAY COMPEL PEACE WITH JAPAN. .
According to private reports, the workmen in several other
big cities, notably Kharkoff, where large locomotive works are lo
cated, already have completed plans for a general suspension of
work. Moreover, reports are current that the workmen, who oth
erwise would soon be forced back into the shops or starve, have
received assurances of financial support from the sources which
hitherto have supplied the sinew s of war for the Liberal and revo
lutionary agitation, but have not before been in touch with the
labor movement. If the strike becomes general throughout Rus
sia, and especially if the railroads are drawn in, it might immedi
ately force the nation to make peace with Japan.
CZAR'S ADVISERS FAVOR FIRM POLICY.
The situation appears grave from every standpoint, but the
authorities, although somewhat bewildered, declare their purpose
to stand firm. They maintain that it is their first duty to preserve
order and scout the idea of actual revolution. Seemingly the Min
isters are most concerned over the effect of the present situation
abroad, where, they declare, exaggerated reports create a false
impression.
SHOP OWNERS ARM FOR PROTECTION.
MOSCOW, Jan. 23. âThe people of Moscow are greatly ex
cited over the news from St. Petertburg, which was received over
the telephone from private sources and spread like wildfire
through the city. Last night it was the only topic of conversa
tion. The workmen here are greatly aroused and the Social Dem
ocrats are resolved to make the best of the opportunity. The fac
tory and mill owners also are excited, as a general suspension of*
work is expected on Januafy 26. Tne owners and the authorities
are conferring in regard to the measures to meet disturbances.
Many shop owners are purchasing arms to protect their property.
Employes of the Bromley Metal Works to the number of
1000 met at 2130 o'clock this afternoon and declared that they re
fused to continue at work because their St. Petersburg comrades
had asked them to strike. They immediately left the works, form
ed a procession, marched through the streets and begged tr.eir
fellow workmen in all industrial establishments to join in the
movement. A majority of those who were thus requested to quit
work complied. Afterward the strikers visited the Sytn Printing
Works, the largest of the kind in Moscow and belonging to the
millionaire publisher, Sytn, and induced the m*n employed tltere
to strike. The works closed at 5 o clock.
THE San Francisco CALL
- ; ,
FAMOUS BUILDING NOW USED AS BARRACKS AND THE ENTRANCE TO THE CZAR'S APARTMENTS.
Workmen Marching Upon St. Petersburg Are
Fired Upon by Imperial Troops.
JiONDON, Jan. 23.âA dispatch from Moscow to Reuters Telegram Company says: "The Deputy Prefect has
issued a proclamation warning the public, fas view of the strike, to avoid assemblages and processions; otherwise
the same severe measures will be adopted as In tit. Petersburg."
ST. PETERSBURG, 24, 3:25 a. in.âA report has gained currency that the strikers intend to storm the
market in Vassillostrov and seize the provisions there. At Kolpino, twelve miles up the river, a body of workmen,
who had started for St. Petersburg to join the strikers, were stopped and fired upon by soldiers. Accounts as to
the number killed or wounded conflict.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23.âEstimates upon the number killed or wounded during the rioting yesterday and
to-day vary greatly, but for the present they are mere guesses.. Official reports place the total at about 250, but
these are not given credence. It is probable that the number will be found to have exceeded 600, and when the
facts are known these figures may be more than doubled. Meanwhile rumors have multiplied until the excited
populace is convinced that many thousands were put to death by the charging Cossacks.*
SEVASTOPOL, Jan. 23.âFire to-day destroyed the great admiralty works. The Are broke out immediate
ly after the signal for beginning work at 1 o'clock this morning. The flamcg burst simultaneously from different
parts of the works, and the whole building was so quickly involved that men in the modeling department barely
escaped by jumping out of the windows. Energetic measures prevented the flames extending to the docks. The
lire was under control at 1:40 o'clock. The cause of the Are is unknown.

ST. PETERSBURG LIKE A CITY BESIEGED BY FOREIGN FOE
FLIGHT OP THE CZAR
AND HIS HOUSEHOLD
FROM TSARSKOE-SELO
Nicholas Loses His
Nerve When Riot
ing Begins.
Special Cable to The Call and Sew Tork
Herald. Copyright, 1905, by the New Tork
â¢ Herald Publishing Company.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23â The
flight of the imperial family from
Tsarskoe-Selo after three and a half
days of secrecy and frequent change
of dwelling from palace to palace, was
. to-day's most noteworthy development.
The Emperor hurriedly left Tsarskoe-
Selo this morning when the news had
' come that the strikers from Kolpino
had chosen that palace as the goal of
their march. Despite the reassuring
statements of court dignitaries and
military men, the Czar is alleged lo
â¢ have lost his nerve immediately and to
have announced his intention to repair
to Peterhof, which is his summer resi
dence.
Objections occurred to official minds
and Gatchina was suggested instead of
Peterhof by the Dowager Empress. The
Czar consented and the imperial party
thereupon made a hasty departure for
the palace where Alexander 111 lived in
seclusion during his entire reign.
Whether the soldiers can be got to
fraternize with the people it is im
possible to say, but I can affirm that
yesterday a guard of marines stationed
on the quay refused to fire when or
dered to do so by their officers. What
happened to them I am unable to as-
Certain, but the principal muster of
facts in the relations between the Gov
ernment and the people are these:
The troops understood that the spir
it of the orders which they had re
ceived "from Grand Duke Vladimir was
not to spare bullets and to use their
own discretion as to the time and plac%
of firing. Secondly, in most cases, some
of which I beheld myself, the people
were not warned beforehand, but the
bugle was sounded for three or five
seconds and before the last note had
died away firing began.
." In another instance the order was
. given to disperse, but time was not
acoprded to carry it out and the people
could not, if they would, recoil.
In at least one case the troops were
moved to fire by sudden anger and not
, by the necessity for preserving order.
I was not myself a witness of the fol
lowing fact, but I have received a
statement from a well known noble
man, who is willing to attest it pub
licly. â¢
"At a police bridge on the Nevsky,"
he said, "I was chatting with a field
surgeon about collisions between the
troops and the people. We were stand
ing beside a Red Cross van. Suddenly
the officer exclaimed, 'Disperse!' The
soldiers fell into firing order and a
member of the public exclaimed: 'You
can show your bravery against your
own people, you fratricides.' The offi
cer cried out, 'Fire!' pointing to the
side whence the word 'fratricide' had
come. There were about twelve wound
ed and dead. I saw one slain woman
lying on her back, having received a
â¢bullet between the eyes. Beside her
lay an elderly man in a fur cloak.
"The troops in this case fired from
pure malice."
WILL DEFY CENSORSHIP.
Four St. Petersburg Editors Say They
Will Publish Truth.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 28.â-The
editors of four newspapers, the Russ,
the Viedomosti, the Novosti and the
Grashdanin, declare their intention,
as soon as the printers return to work
and they are able to resume publica
tion, openly to defy tne censorship in
the matter of strike news and Sun
day's affair. They drew up a letter to
the censor to-day, saying they felt the
gravity of the situation, and demand
ed that they be permitted to print the
facts without minimizing or glossing
them over. The Novoe Vremya and
other papers, however, refused to join
â¢ and the letter was not sent, but the
editors of the four papers named agree
to adopt the course Indicated.
It is reported that a number of mills
and factories will start up to-morrow.
Some of the industrial managers be
lieve that the worst Is over. Father
Gopon's message to his followers to
night was: "The Czar does not exist.
No longer pray for liberty."
Arrested for Shooting at Czar.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 28.âDavid-
off, the captain, and Kurseff, the senior
officer of the battery from which the
loaded shell was fired on January 19,
striking the imperial pavilion, In which

the Russian capital is usually bright.
St. Petersburg resembled a city of the
dead invaded by a hostile army. The
facades of the buildings were black, and
every restaurant and place of amuse
ment was closed. The only sound to
be heard was the deadened patter of
the hoofs of the cavalry horses and the
tramp of marching men over the snow
as the Emperor's legions moved to and
fro.
The guards at the palaces of the
Grand Dukes are especially heavy, and
more than 20,000* troops are massed at
Tsarskoe-Selo.
AUTOCRACY TO GIVE WAY.
John C. Rare I Believes the Czar Will
Grant a Constitution. -
DENVER, Jan. 23.âJohn C. Karel,
former Consul General in Russia from
this country, now an inmate of the
Oakes Home for Consumptives In this
city, in an interview to-day, declared
that in his opinion no revolution is im
minent in Russia.
"I do not believe," said Karel, "that
there is any widespread conspiracy to
unseat the Czar. The entire trouble is
this: The cotton mill workers are out
on a strike. The students of S.t. Peters
burg are probably their aiders and
abettors, as they Usually are. These
are making a little local trouble, just
about as the striking miners . made
trouble in Colorado last year. Their
object is to call the attention of the'
Czar to their condition, just as the ob
ject of the striking coal miners was
to attract President Roosevelt's atten
tion. /
"The Czar is a very kindhearted and
sensible man. I believe Russia will be
made a constitutional monarchy within
twenty-flve years, as Nicholas II de
sires it, but the people are not ready
for it now."

KAISER DEEPLY CONCERNED.
Berlin officials Say Czar Bare Not
Yield to the Revolutionists.
BERLIN, Jan. 28.âEmperor Wil
liam and the members of his entour
age sat ud late last night receiving
press and private telegrams from St.
Petersburg. The keenest interest pre
vails here, where Russia is probably
better understood than elsewhere, be
cause of geographical nearness and
close business relationship. While the
is looked upon as one which
proceeded from the hearts of the peo
ple, the Foreign Office does not believe
that it presages a revolution, because
It lacks efficient leadership and is
without adequate support among the
bulk of the people throughout the em
pire. Government control of the tele
graph lines and.railroads makes co
operation of the discontented impos
sible. At the time of the French rev
olution a man could walk from Bor
deaux to Paris, but no one can walk
from Odessa to St. Petersburg and
partake in the events there. The offi
cial view is that, although any friends
of Russia must be sorrowful over the
internal situation, the Russian Gov
ernment dare not drop the reins or
the horses will run away. The Gov
ernment, to avoid anarchy, must act
stringently.

GRAND DUKE SNEERS
AT PEOPLE'S DEMAND
FOR REPRESENTATION
More Blood to Flow
if Vladimir Has
His Way.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 23.âThe strongest,
crudest, most imperious man in Rus
sia to-day is Grand Duke Vladimir, the
eldest uncle of the czar. On him in
this emergency depends, to a great ex
tent, the fate of the monarchy. He
seeks to save the throne because he
wants to occupy it himself.
From one who knows him, who saw
him daily for months at a time at a
Russian health resort and who has had
long talks with him, the following de
scription comes:
"His countenance did not move a
muscle when he spoke. I noticed that
his eye lids even did not wink for
minutes at a time. His was a face of
iron, betokening a dominating, imperi
ous, fearless character. When I en
tered his apartment in the wake of an
aid, Vladimir was scribbling a note
at a little desk. He Jumped up and
put. out his hand.
" 'How do you do?' he said, in very
good English. Glad to see you. Sit
down.'
"He drew his chair close up to mine.
The aid left the room and we started
to talk about Russian affairs and poli
tics. It was easy to recognize the im
periousness of the man in his sharp,
clear-cut sentences. His bearded face
was shaven at the chin, exposing a
tenacious, iron Jaw that denoted his
strength of character. '*
"He talked with surprising frankness,
revealing that he strongly favored the
expansion of Russia into Manchuria
and the Far East. That policy, which
led to the war with Japan, has been
ascribed to Vladimir, and I knew he
vigorously urged on the Government.
I asked him whether it was true that
the was kept in ignorance of
many things that went on In Russia,
especially in connection With the peo
ple's demand for greater freedom. His
reply was a sneer at the persons who
were foolish enough to believe such re
ports. The rulers of Russia, he said,
knew what was best for the people; the
masses were not fitted yet to control
themselves. I spoke of a conversation
I had had with a Russian official, who
told me that the people could be al
lowed to advance only a step at a time,
because to give them too much free
dom would be to turn their heads and
ruin the country. Vladimir expressed
his agreement with the statement.
"If Vladimir has * free hand the
revolution will be crushed with.an iron
hand, though Russia runs with blood."
SERVICES FOR THE CZAR.
Russians Give Thanks That He Es-
caped Injury In Riots.
Special services were held yesterday
in the Russian Greek Church on
Powell street to give thanks that the
Czar had escaped injury in the St. Pe
tersburg disturbances. Bishop Tikhen
of the local diocese spoke at some
length on the present crisis in Russia.
He gave It as his opinion that the peo
ple had been misguided and failed to
realize the enormity of their actions in
rebelling against the lawful authority
of the state.

ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23.âEmper
or Nicholas is completely prostrated by
grief. He is reported to be almost In a
State of collapse over the situation. In
the meantime everything awaits his
decision. All the schools are closed.
Every window in Grand Duke Ser
gius' St. Petersburg Palace was broken
by a mob during'the night.
| The story of the events immediately
i preceding and during yesterday's out-
I break, as viewed by omeial'eyes, is giv
j en in the Oiheial Messenger as follows:
"All attempts of the factory inspec-
I tors to pacify the workmen were fruit
| less and every worker of the large
factories joined the strike, which
spread quickly and extended to nearly
ali the works in the city. At the same
time the demands of the men increased
and these were formulated in writing,
mostly by Father Gopon. The employ
ers discussed the demands and decided
that if some of them were satisfied it
could not fail to ruin industry, while
others deserved to be examined and
partially conceded. Furthermore, will
ingness was expressed to negotiate
with the men, but not with the strik
ers' organization. The workmen re
fused to agree to it and violated the
agreements between the masters and
men of the different factories.
REVOLI TIOMSTS TO BLAME.
"As the strike was being conducted
without disturbance of public order, no
repressive measures were adopted and
not a single person was arrested. The
agitation of the workmen's organiza
tion was, however, soon joined by agi
tation of revolutionary circles. On the
morning of January 21 the Workmen's
Association, led by Father Gopon, ap
peared with open revolutionary tend
encies. On Sunday, Father Gopon drew
up a petition of workmen to the Em
peror, which contained, besides de
mands on behalf of the men, insolent
demands of a political character.
Among the workmen verbal and writ
ten notifications were circulated, urging
the necessity for a meeting on January
22 on the Palace Square, In order,
through Father Gopon, to submit the<
petition to the Emperor. One of the
demands was of a political character
and the real purpose of the meeting on
the Palace Square was concealed from
the workmen. Fanatical speeches
which Father Gopon, forgetting his j
clerical dignity, addressed to the men, !
and criminal agitation excited the men
to such an extent that on January 22
large crowds proceeded to the center
of the city.
SERIES OF BLOODY COLLISIONS.
"At some points bloody collisions oc
curred betweeh them and the troops, in
consequence of their refusal to obey
the police regulations, or owing to their
direct attacks on the troops. The lat
ter were obliged to fire in the Schlus
setberg causeway, near the Narva Tri
umphal Gate: in Troitjki Square, and
in the fourth line of the Vasslliostrov
quarter; in the Alexander Gardens, at
the corner of Nevsky " Prospect and
Gogol streets, near the police bridge
and at the Kazan Cathedral. In the
fourth line the populace erected three
barricades of planks and wire. On one
of these a red flag was hoisted. From
the windows of neighboring bouses
shots were fired and stones were
thrown at the military. The crowd
took swords from the policemen and
armed themselves therewith. They pil
laged the Schaff small arm factory and
carried off about a hundred swords, a
large number of which, however, the
police recovered. The crowd destroyed
telegraph wires and knocked down
poles. The municipal building in theâ¢
Second District was attacked and de
molished. In the evening five shops on
the St. Petersburg side were plun
dered."
STRIKE HEADQUARTERS CLOSED.
Interior Minister Sviatopolk-Mirsky
at 11 o'clock this morning telegraphed
orders to close the headquarters of the
Workmen's Union. This was done by
the workmen themselves without police
After the last volley in the Vas
siliostrov quarter at midnight the men
abandoned the few barricades which
they held untir that hour and retired.
The word was passed around by the
leaders to remain quiet for the present.
During the night a fine, damp snow
fell, covering the ugly red stains and
obliterating all traces of the conflict
of yesterday and with the break of
day the city, except for the presence
of troops in the streets, had resumed
its normal appearande. The shops had
reopened and general traffic was par
tially resumed. The men appeared at
work in several of the factories and
mills, including the works of the Rus
sian Westinghouse Company, but the
managers in a majority of eases told
them to remain away for a few days
and that in the meantime they would
receive their pay.
The people generally were nervous
and apprehensive and kept indoors.
The strikers, looking weary and hag
gard after the excitement of yester
day, collected in sullen little groups
in the vicinity of their various head
quarters and yesterday's barricades
awaiting the decision of their leaders
regarding the plan of action. They
were in an ugly mood and broke out
in curses whenever soldiers marched
by.
GCARDS HOLD THE BRIDGES.
An early morning tour by a press
correspondent showed that a cordon
of troops barred the entrance of the
city from the big industrial sections.
The bridges were still held by the
guards regiments, it being rather
strange to see the officers of the Im
perial Guards, the pets of the St.
Petersburg drawing-rooms, riding
thoroughbreds and doing police duty in
the streets around the palace. There
was no. trace of excitement. The big
square which yesterday was filled with
troops was empty, but inside the palace
court, beyond the sight of the passers-
by, a regiment of dragoons and several
companies of infantry were quartered.
Rumors were current that the stri
kers proposed to proclaima general at
tack on property and a reign of an
archy, but the labor leaders denied this
in the most vigorous terms. One of
Father Gopon's lieutenants declared
that the leaders of the strikers had
resolved to preach the gospel of armed
resistance and the overthrow of au
tocracy, but that it did not carry with
It a threat of pillage or an attack on
property.
GOPON EI.l DES THE POLICE.
The police have not yet been able to
locate Father Gopon, though they, are
searching for him everywhere. His
whereabouts is known only to half a
dozen trusted lieutenants, through
whom he issued orders.
No newspapers have appeared since
Friday except the Official Messenger,
containing the Government decrees,
which is printed under military pro
tection at the office of the State Bank,
where the banknotes are issued. Offi
cial accounts of yesterday's affair were
posted on all the bulletin boards. Strik
ers who came to read spat upon them.
As the day advanced the crowds on
Nevsky Prospect increased, but the
police did not allow them to collect.
Squadrons of Cossacks, with lances
and carbines, patrolled the thorough
fares as a reminder of what would
occurr at the least disturbance. A
half regiment of infantry stacked arms
and remained on duty on the Morskaia.
a fashionable boulevard of the city,
and at noon troops were again march
ed into the Palace square, where peo
ple wire once more trying to collect.
All the Grand Dukes' palaces were
strongly guarded.
T HOOPS FED ON STREETS.
St. Petersburg has often witnessed
rioting, clearing the streets of demon
strators and Cossack charges with
whips and sabers, but the bloodshed
of yesterday is unparalleled in its his
tory and the many stories of brutality
told by the populace seem to have con
vinced them that a programme of des
perate blood-letting was planned to
overawe the strikers. This is indig
nantly denied by the authorities, who
protest earnestly that they regret that
the situation compelled such stern
measures. They say order had to be
restored or the city would have fallen
Into the hands of the mob.
The troops received their noon meal
in the streets, steaming camp kitchens
being driven from place to place. An
instance of the perfect military man
agement occurred shortly after 1
o'clock to-day, when there was a dis
turbance on the Palace bridge. A
bugle rang out and in less than a min
ute five squadrons of cavalry emerged
from neighboring streets at a gallop,
charging to the alarm. But the few
obstreperous, half-drunken strikers had
already been overpowered, placed in
sleighs and taken to jails.
GENERAL. BEATEN TO DEATH.
Among the authenticated horrors of
yesterday was the case of an aged
general, whose sledge was stopped by
the infuriated people as he was driving
in the direction of the troops.
"Are you going to order them to fire
on us?" yelled the crowd.
When the general ordered his coach
man to drive on, he was instantly
struck on the head by a well dressed
person in a sable fur coat. The gen
eral was then thrown out of the sledge
and beaten and trampled to death.
There are continued rumors of dis
satisfaction among the troops here. It
Is now reported that in addition to the
Moscow' Guard Regiment, the Finland
and Isrr.alosky regiments declined to
obey orders to fire yesterday.
Toward 5 o'clock, driving up the
Nevsky Prospect, a press correspond
ent saw through the gathering gloom
the blaze of eampflres In the Palace
square, with the dark forms of troop
ers sitting around them.
The Nevsky Prospect Itself was
ablaze with light. Strikers and curi
osity-seekers promenaded the two
miles of sidewalk between the Admi
ralty and the Nicholas station, and
squadrons of hussars and cuirassiers
rode up and down in endless proces
sion. The crowds seemed peaceful
enough, the watchword evidently be
ing "Don't abuse the troops." The
only shouts heard were a few isolated
hurrahs.
CITY THROWN INTO DARKNESS.
Suddenly the electric lights in the
upper section, between the bazaar
called Gostinny Dvor and the Nicholas
station, were extinguished, and the
thoroughfare was plunged without
warning into utter darkness, which
was not relieved even by the lights in
shop windows, as all the stores were
closed. The scene was. weird and
funereal. The driver at first refused
to move on, fearing some hidden dan
ger, but he finally was persuaded to
proceed, exclaiming with Russian
stoicism: "One can die only once."
A deathly silence prevailed, height
ened by the rustle of hundreds of feet
on the snow-clad sidewalks, the muf
fled tread of looming squadrons and
the lugubrious hammering of- shop
keepers, taking precautions against
possible attack by boarding up the
windows of their stores with rough
lumber. The curious hastily scurried
in adjoining streets, finding their way
home as best they could through the
inky darkness. Only a fringe of sul
len strikers and rough characters re
mained, the police warning all to get
home as soon as possible.
TROOPS USE FLATS OF SABERS.
The only bright spot was a blase of
light from one of the courtyards of
the Annilchkoff Palace, whence the
Empress Dowager yesterday fled to
Tsarskoe-Selo. Beyond stood the
dark, grim palace of Grand Duke Ser
gius.
The crowd was particularly dense
around the approaches to the Nicholas
station. Here, in the darkness, mau
rauders attacked a few news venders'
stalls, but a grim' row of infantry
around the station buildings effectu
ally discouraged violence. Other dis
turbers broke numerous windows in
the Gostinny Dvor and the Kiosk at
the corner of the Annilchkoff Palace
garden. A bench torn up from the
adjoining park was placed In the
roadway In the hope that it might
trip up cavalry. Some policemen
were roughly handled and disarme"d
in side streets, but there was no firing.
As the correspondent drove down' the
Nevsky Prospect, troopers were clear
ing the sidewalks of loiterers, using
the flats of their sabers and causing a
general stampede.
This continued until 9 o'clock to
night, when the lights were again
turned on and revealed the Nevsky
Prospect almost deserted.
DEEP CONCERN IN VIENNA.
Belief Expressed That Revolutionary
Spirit Will Not Down.
VIENNA, Jan. 23.âThe occurrences
of Sunday in St. Petersburg have made
the deepest impression here upon all
classes and are practically the sole top
ic of discussion at the principal cafes
and clubs. There being no Sunday aft
ernoon papers here, the people did not
learn the full story of the St. Peters
! burg riots until this morning. A few
! of the newspapers here posted bulletins
Sunday afternoon outside their build
ings, but these were read by compara
tively few, most of the Viennese being
then in the cafes, theaters or conceit
halls.
This morning the papers published
extra editions with black head lines,
most of them reading "Revolution has
broken out In St. Petersburg." The
afternoon newspapers print page after
page of St. Petersburg dispatches,
practically excluding all other news.
The lack of a repressive censorship in
Russia and the fact that the whole
story apparently was telegraphed from
St. Petersburg were much commented
upon and declared to be unprecedented.
The St. Petersburg occurrences were
called "A full-fledged revolution," "A
day of terror" and "Bloody Sunday." â
The feeling prevails in anti-Russian
quarters that open revolution has be
gun and that there is no telling where
it will end. All the members of Jhe .
Russian legation were at the Embassy
I all day anxiously reading and discuss
ing the news received from the news
papers or brought in by diplomats.
Diplomatic circles here are deeply
concerned over the St. Petersburg
news. It is believed, however, that the
present disorder will soon be put down
by the troops now in St. Petersburg,
but in some quarters it is thought that
in so doing It will only increase the bit
terness of the rage of the people and In
no wise help the situation or put a stop
to the growth of the revolutionary
spirit.
All the newspapers comment on the
occurrences in St. Petersburg as ex
tremely serious and deeply significant,
and the movement of the people of St.
Petersburg toward the Winter Palace
is compared to the march of the people
of Paris on Versailles in 1789. It is de
clared; the Emperor's answering the
peoples petition with bullets will irre
trievably widen the breach between
him and his subjects.
The newspapers also publish sketches
of the lives of Emperor Nicholas,
Father Gopon and many of the higher
Russian officials at considerable length.
ELDER IS TURNED OVER
TO THE UNDERWRITERS
Owners Accept Insurance and Waive
Their Rights In the Wrecked

PORTLAND, Jan. 23.âThe steam
ship George W. Elder, which sunk In
the Columbia River yesterday, has
been turned over to the insurance un
derwriters, her owners, the Harriman
interests, preferring to accept the in
surance rather than keep the wreck
and take the chances of raising her.
The crew has been paid off and the

"I bought a fifty-cent package of

Seldom, if ever, is there any doubt
about the effect produced by the use
of Pyramid Pile Cure, as Is shown
by the experience given above. The
proprietors of this remedy have thous

surely no better proof of the merit of
the preparation could be asked; when
it is borne in mind that these letters
are wholly unsolicited, there is cer

Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by drug- '

PRISON CELL
HOLDS LAWYER
Prominent Attorney of Los
Angeles Is Arrested on ;i
Charge of Forging Deeds
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23.âA. Groves,
an attorney, who has practiced here
two years, was arrested this evening at
the instigation of the District Attor
ney, on charges of wholesale forging
and swindling all along the coast. He
is said to have uttered false deeds to
dozens of pieces of property with dor
mant titles, sold and resold them, and
victimized scores of purchasers in San
Francisco, Portland and Los Angeles
to the extent of thousands of dollars.
That the documents were forged has
been proven and the seemingly endless
chain of bogus titles has been traced
link by link until the most damaging
evidence against Groves has been se
cured. Several warrants will be issued
for him In the morning.
It is believed he has several accom
plices, as the operations charged to him
were too extensive for one man to
carry on. In all the deals P. Hackett
and A. Langworthy figure prominently
âat least on the paperâand Groves
claims they are his sisters-in-law. They
cannot be found and the officials claim
no such persons exist.
Mrs. Annetta A. Pullen of Lowell.
Mich., has owned certain lots here for
years, but by chance the records were
found to show that H. Hill of Port
land, Ore., apparently owned them, a
deed executed in 1883 and recorded in
November, 1904, being found. Groves
claimed to be the attorney for Hill,
and he declared the property was sold
to H. Langdon of the Palace Hotel,
San Francisco. Detectives found the
document had been mailed to Lang
don. care of box 144, Station C, City,
November 15. The box belongs to
Groves. Mrs. Pullen never deeded the
lots to any one.
This is a sample of the many pe
culiar transactions charged to Groves,
there being nearly always San Fran
cisco and Portland connections. It is
supposed there are confederates in
those places. Groves is said to have
been several years in San Francisco,
and his record there is .being looked
up.
In Portland the names used in ac
knowledgments have been investigat
ed and found to be those of real
notaries, but the seals are thought to
have been duplicated and forged.

ONLY A STRIKERS' RIOT,
ACCORDING TO CASSINI
Russian Embassador Saus It Does
Not Mean a Revolution.
JUSTIFIES THE FIRING UPON THE MOBS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.âCount Cas
sini. the Russian Embassador, has had
no official confirmation from St. Peters
burg about the* riots there, but in a
conversation to-night with a represen
tative of the press the Embassador, af
ter reading the afternoon dispatches,
said:
"Human life is sacred the world over
and nowhere more so than in Russia,
but it should be remembered that the
public peace is of predominating im
portance and vigorous measures are
some times necessary to preserve or
der. This is the situation in the Rus
sian capital. There is a great indus
trial strike in progress. Because their
demands have not been forthwith
granted the strikers, as strikers in
every country have done, have en
deavored 10 storm the Emperor's own
palace in an effort to gain an audience
with his Majesty. The troops ordered
them to stop outside the gates and the
crowd refused. The troops then fired a
volley of blank cartridges, and on came
the crowd. There was oniy one thing
to be done âto fire with ball cartridges.
That stopped the strikers and they fled
in every direction.
"There is a great deal of difference
between a riot and a revolution, and
Americans will make a great mistake
if they infer from the stories of dis
turbances that the demonstration is
revolutionary, or even hostile to the
war. The love of a great people for
their sovereign is not wiped out by the
cries of a few brawlers. It will be
found when public order has been re
stored that the traditional and ancient
affection of the 'tussian people for
their Emperor still abides.
"When violence has been suppressed
and order restored the strikers, through
the proper channels, will be given a
hearing; their demands will be con
sidered and all that with Justice and
expediency can be done in their be
half will be forthcoming.
"Strikes occur In every country. No
country appreciates this more, per
haps, than the I'nited States, and in
no country would an attack upon the
head of the country's ruler be repelled
more quickly than in your own.
"You have asked me for a word of
comment upon the press dispatchesâ
for, as you know, 1 have no official ad
vices. I can only say that It is an
unfortunate conditiea of affairs, which,
I hope, soon will be relieved. The
demonstrations are not against the
war; there is no revolution in Russia,
nor will there be."
The State Department has received
no word from its representatives
abroad regarding the outbreak in St.
Petersburg yesterday. While trouble
of some kind had fully been expected
to follow the formulation of the work
ingmen's demands in St. Petersburg
and the attempt to present them to the
Czar, the officials here were generally
of the opinion that serious conse
quences might be averted by the ex
ercise of diplomacy on the part of the
Czar's advisers and it was not sup
posed that the workingmen would by
absolutely shut out from access to the
Czar. It was believed that the Czar
would receive some committee to avoid
his coming into contact with the mob,
which would, it is believed, have satis
fied the petitioners, even though the
substance of their requests was de
nied.

PROBLEM BEYOND CZAR.
Andrew D. White Discusses the Sit
uation in Russia.
TTHACA, N. V.. Jan. 23.âAndrew D.
White, former Embassador to Russia,
one of the best informed Americans on
Russian affairs, to-day made the fol
lowing statement in regard to the situ
ation In St. Petersburg:
"If the Czar is a weak man. as the
present Emperor is, he can do very lit
tle. A weak man cannot know any
thing about the empire to speak of, be
cause he is surrounded by Grand
Dukes, women, etc.. who tell him what
they want him to believe and keep all
the truth away from him, which they
do not wish him to hear."
"The main difficulty in the whole case
is that the Emperor is supposed to do
all the thinking for 410,000,000 people
scattered over the largest territory pos
sessed by any government in the world,
with all sorts of .different races, relig
ions and Ideas, and this no man can do,
and least of all in a time like this.
"The simple fact is that the evils of
the old system have now become abso
lutely intolerable. And when you add
to that fact the sending of immense
numbers of the best young men in the
country to an utterly useless and
wicked war, and the pressure of taxa
tion which grinds the people to the
dust, you have a situation which none
but the very strongest rulers in all
human history can cope with. The
Czar has no strength of character, no
proper education and is hopelessly un
fit to grapple with the situation.
"No doubt the worst of the features
of the situation have been kept from
him."
White said it was not likely the ad
visers of the Emperor would try to
follow out the policy of Emperor Nich
olas I, who had the ringleaders of the
insurrection of eighty years ago shot,
hanged or sent to Siberia. He did not
believe, however, that important
changes In Russia could long be de
layed.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN SLAIN.

PARIS. Jan. 28.âThe tragedy in
St. Petersburg continues to absorb at
tention here. The students of the law
school attempted to make a demon
stration this morning. The course of
studies was interrupted by mingled
cries and hisses and later the students
paraded without serious incident.
Dispatches from Marseilles an
nounce that the presence there of a
number of revolutionists and anarch
ists has been reported to the Russian
embassy here.
Special dispatches from St. Peters
burg to the Paris newspapers give
supplementary details of yesterday's
fighting. Buzajicy telegraphs to the
Petit Journal that he was an eyewit
ness of a fight in the Vasailiostrov dis
trict. The soldiers, he said, fired vol
ley after volley and then used their
bayonets. He saw a hundred strikers
lying on the ground there.
Other French eyewitnesses declare
they saw women and children among
those who were shot down. One child
of eight was terribly disfigured by a
rush of soldiery.
POPE PRAYS FOR RUSSIA.
Hopes the Situation Is Not aa Black

his wife and daughters. The Pope is

of Russ'a.
Reports received at the Vatican
from Russia say that, notwithatand-
ing the efforts of their Bishops, the
Catholics are excited and it is im
possible to keep them from participat
ing in the popular movements, espe
cially in Poland, where every part of

The Pope was most distressed at the

Russia was not so black as depicted.

SLAV ADMIRAL BITTERLY
DENOUNCES STOESSEL
Accuses Him of Cowardice
General Kondratenko the Real Hero of
the Port Arthur Defense.
TOKIO, Jan. 28.âA Russian ad
miral who has ivpt joined the prison
ers from Port Arthur now in Japan
baa given to the press an extended
statement covering the defense and
surrender of the fortress. He char
acterizes the surrender before the
garrison had reached its extremity as
a disgrace, bitterly criticizes General
Stoessel and lauds Major General Kon- .
dratenko, commander of the Seventh J
East Siberian Rifle Brigade, as the .
t r ue hero of the defense of Port ;
Arthur. *
The admiral says that Vice Admiral â¢
Makaroff, who commanded the Rus- j
sian squadron at Port Arthur and who .
went down with the battleship Petro- j
pavlovsk on April 13, dictated the pol- !
icy of inactivity on the part of the I
sguadron, taking the ground that it
would be hopeless, owing to the in- I
feriority of the Russian msyal strength, j
to engage the fleet of Vice Admiral t
Togo-, and that it would be unwise to j
divide the force defending Port Arthur
by running ships to Vladivostok or to j
neutral ports. The admiral admits
tiiat bitter friction existed between the I
army and navy, and intimates that*!
there is a possibility of inquiry into
this matter by court martial. He in
sists that the Russians destroyed their
warships at Port Arthur beyond any
possibility of salvage by the Japanese.
BITTER TOWARD STOESSEL.
"I am sorry to say that from the
first General Stoessel proved to be in
cupable," said the admiral. "Though
in full comrfland, he never visited the
fighting positions during the lifetime
of General Kondratenko. Kondraten
ko was not only the life of the .de
fense, but he possessed in a large
measure the quality of peacemaker.
He intervened in all cases of trouble
and always eloquently pleaded the
cause of the Emperor and the neces
sity for defense, and these he placed
above private differences. His cease
less energy, patience and courage won
the confidence of the higher officers of
bcth the army and navy, and likewise
of the common soldiers. Fortunately
foi the defense, he was able in, large
measure to direct its policy. Stoessel
left much to him, and the officers of
the navy recognized in him the one
man capable of fusing the discordant
elements. Â«
"By day and by night General Kon
dratenko visited every portion of the
position and constantly risked his life.
He was our inspiration. No Russian
need be ashamed of the defense made
by the garrison while Kondratenko
lived.
SURRENDER A DISGRACE.
â¢It is difficult for a Russian officer
to talk about the end. It was worse
than a mistake-it was a disgrace. The
fortress could easily have held out for
another month, as it had food'and am
munition sufficient for that period, and
if Kondratenko had remained alive it
would have held out for months longer.
"In Kondratenko the garrison not
only lc-st a leader, but the one man who
had the ability and the power, through
his tremendous earnestness, to control
Stoessel.
"For nearly two weeks known
among the officers that Stoessel and his
chief of staff, Relss, who was incom
petent, were preparing to surrender.
Through Stoessel's servants the sol
diers became aware of what was com
ing, and, brave as they were, the
knowledge destroyed their enthusiasm.
"At a council of war he three days
before capitulation, at which twenty
two of the higher offi:eirs of the army
and navy were present, General Stoes
sel represented that if Port Arthur
were taken by assaul. there would be
fighting in the streets and possibly a
massacre. He mentioned the women
and children of the garrison and said
he thought it was the duty of the
council to avoid such a possibility.
Notwithstanding these representations,
only three officersâChief of Staff Reiss
and two others âfavored capitulation.
NOTE TO NOGI UNEXPECTED.
"Stoessel's note to General Wogi came
without warning, and the word 'sur
prise' inadequately expresses our con
dition after the sentiment of the ma
jority council had been ex
pressed. the officers said and
felt and how the men thought and be
haved will all be known later; but I
say now, and I believe, that the major
ity of the officers of the garrison will
support me, that the capitulation of the
fortress was a disgrace to R*ussla.
"We never feared a Japanese attempt |
to take the forts by assault. The Rus
sian soldiers were always anxious to
meet the Japanese at close quarters,
and even at the last our men were con
fident of their superiority with the
bayonet.
"The Japanese behaved excellently
when they entered Port Arthur, and
there was no suggestion of disorder or
lawlessness.
"I came as a prisoner to Japan be
cause I felt it to be my duty to share
the destinies of our men. I do not
criticize those who gave their parole,
but I bel'eve that I would be dishon
ored if I returned to Russia after do
ing so."
REFUGEES PRAISE JAPANESE.
CHEFU, Jan. 23.âThirteen junks,
containing 500 men, women and chil
dren, after a passage of sixty hours
from Port Arthur, arrived here to-day.
The passengers were immediately sent
on board the British steamship Muen
chen, which has been chartered by the
Russian Government to take them
home.
All of the Russians speak highly of
the consideration shown by the Jap
anese after the fortress capitulated, and
the majority of them look upon their
long wait on the shores of Pigeon Bay,
without shelter, as being unavoidable.
The refugees say that since the first
few days following the surrender of
Port Arthur, there has practically been
no looting, the Japanese officials deal
ing sternly with all offenders. The
Chinese were more culpable in this re
spect than the Japanese, who generally
confined themselves to taking small
articles, which they,, probably wanted
chiefly as souvenirs.
LAST WORD TO GARRISON.
One of the passengers arriving on the
Junks to-day brought a copy of Gen
eral Stoessel's final proclamation to the
garrison, dated January 2. In it the
Russian commander reviews the glori
ous record of the defenders and refers
to the slow, resistless tightening of the
Japanese cordon, to the ceaseless rain
of great shells, which he say nothing
could resist, and to the utter exhaustion
of the resisting power of the fortress.
"It Is apparent," the proclamation
says, "that further resistance would be
merely daily murder. / It is the duty of
every commander tpjavoid the useless
sacrifice of lives. It is not hard to die
for one's country, but I must be brave
enough to surrender."
In concluding. General Stoessel said
that the fortress had done its work.
There was no longer a fleet to be pro
tected. A vast Japanese army had been
crushed, it was pointed out. and kept
I frcm Joining the armies in Manchuria
against General Kuropatkin. General
Stoessel thanked officers, soldiers and
civilians for their devotion, and then
announced his surrender, "with fuil
consciousness of the sacred duty I per
form."
MANY LOST IN RAID.

ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23.â1n a
dispatch from General Kuropatkin to
Emperor Nicholas, dated January 22.
additional details are given of General
Mistchenko's raid of January 10 to 14.
General Kurotfatkin mentions a num
ber of officers who distinguished them
selves by bravery before Yinkow, and
gives the total losses for the four days
as seven officers and 73 men killed and
32 officers and 257 men wounded and 21
men missing. General Kuropatkin says
the raid caused the greatest alarm in
the Japanese rear guard.

â¢ LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28.âFighting
between the cattle men and sheep men
is the hourly dread of Antelope Val
ley. Many sheep men are bringing
â¢ their docks from Inyo and other coun
ties north for pasture. The cattle men
are armed and keeping a grim lookout
and a bloody clash is expected. Thou
sands of sheep are known to be on the
way to the grassy slopes between Lan
caster and Palmdale, which the south
ern stockmen claim. They say they
will shoot down all the wool and mut
ton men who try to intrude. The lat
ter declare they will have the grass.
Yesterday morning word came that a
large band of sheep was in the valley
near Palmdale. A large company of
cattle men, armed with rifles, rode out
at dawn to drive them out by force.
Luckily the Basques had been warned
and turned back and violence was
averted.
The cattle men object to the sheep
men sharing the pasture with them for
several reasons. One Is the ancient
superstition that cattle will not graze
on land that sheep have been over. The
sheep men think that In this vast land
scape there should be room enough
for all.
CHICAGO JAIL
HOLDS YATES
Han Wanted for Dorchester
Hotel Robbery Arrested
by Police of Windy City
*
Advices received here last night
from Chicago announce that Andrew
Yates, who is wanted by the San Fran
cisco police for the robbery of $3000
worth of diamonds from Mr. and Mrs.
Cundlefinger of the Hotel Dorchester
several months ago, is now held there
on suspicion of being a pickpocket.
According to the telegram, Yates,
â who was arrested in Chicago under the
name of Jack Williams, has confessed
that he is the man who robbed the
Gundlefingers and is a member of a
wealthy California family. He said
his grandmother had frequently ob
tained his release from jail on his
promise to mend his ways.
In support of his own story Yates
told the Chicago police that pawntick
ets for a part of the plunder stolen
by him in this city could be found in
the old Inter Ocean Hotel at Chicago.
Although the police of the latter city
claim that they have received from
San Francisco telegraphic confirmation
of Yatess' story, the detectives here last
night professed to have no information
regarding Yates' arrest.
While the Chicago police are-Jiolding
Yates on several charges they have
signified their willingness to turn him
over to the San Francisco authorities
should the latter'want him. Yester
* day's telegraphic story from Pasadena
of the arrest of a bellboy on suspicion
of having rebbed the guests of a hotel,
there of $15,000 worth of jewelry caused
some of the local detectives to suspect
that possibly the Pasadena boy was
Yates. Last night's dispatch from Chi
cago, however, dispelled this theory.
The Chicago prisoner will probably be
sent for by Chief Wittman.
Changes in the Postoffice.
A report was current yesterday that
several important changes were to be
made in the San Francisco postoffice.
Among these was the transfer of Ben
jamin F. McKinley from the assistant
postmastership to the superintendency
of one of the sub-stations, the position
formerly occupied by him when his
nephew, President McKinley, appoint
ed him assistant postmaster. Hull Mc-
Claughry, Postmaster Fisk's secretary,
denied all knowledge of the proposed
change, but intimated that other
changes would be made in a day or
two. .

SMOOT SILENT
ON ENDOWMENTS
Refuses to Reveal Oaths He
Took in Mormon Church
to the Board of Inquiry
WISHES TESTIMONY
Admits That No Action Has
Been Taken Against Presi
dent Smith by Apostles
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.âThe Senate
investigation into the protest against
Senator Reed Smoot \vlll be concluded
this week. The cross-examination of
the respondent terminated earlier than
expected. It was announced just be
fore adjournment of the Committee on
Privileges and Elections that only a
few more witnesses would be put on
the stand. Except for some docu
mentary evidence the investigation
may be concluded to-morrow. Chair
man Burrows remarked that it was
necessary to get through with the ar
guments also this week, as Tayler,
counsel for the protestants, will as
sume his duties as Federal Judge in
Ohio next Tuesday.
The cross examination of Senator
Smoot resulted in his absolute refusal
to testify In regard to the endowment
ceremonies. He also asserted that It
was not his business to call to account
President Smith of the Mormon church
because Smith had admitted to the
committee that he was living in viola
tion of the laws of the land.
'Three other witnesses refused to di
vulge the character of the endowment
ceremonies.
When asked to tell of the endowment
ceremonies Smoot said:
I made a vow. not an oath, with my God,
not with any man. not with the president of
the church, or with a living soul, but I did
make a vow that I would keep these endow
ment ceremonies secret and not reveal them to
anybody, and I have kept that all my life, and
If I went out of the church to-morrow ana re-
mained out of the church until I was gray
headed 1 would never feel that it vai my duty
or that I should divulge what little I even re
member of them.
Senator Burrows referred to Senator
Smoot's expression of surprise at the
testimony of President Smith as to the
number of children he had had since
the manifesto and asked if he had said
anything to President Smith since his
testimony in regard to the matter. The
witness replied that he had not. He
said the apostles had not taken up the
matter.
John M. Whittaker gave unimportant
testimony and declined to answer about
the endowment ceremonies.
J. U. Eldridge, County Clerk of Salt
Lake County, testified that H. S. Tan
ner was defeated for Judge by Mormon
votes because of the circulation of a
rumor that he had taken several plural
wives since the manifesto.

DIES ON TRAIN
ON WAY HOME
Miss Mary McKee of Alameda
Passes Away in Strange
Manner Near Albuquerque
REFUSES PORTER'S AID
Relatives Believe That She
Succumbed to Pneumonia
After a Prolonged Trip
Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. Mf, Jan. 28.â
A death, shrouded by much mystery,
occurred on the train which arrived
here late last night. The victim is a
woman, 25 or 30 years old, and papers
show her name to be Mary McKee of
2251 San Jose avenue, Alameda, Cal.
Her ticket reads from Chicago to Los
Angeles. The Pullman conductor and
porter say that when she entered the
coach she was heavily veiled. After
retiring the first night she did not
leave her berth again until taken out a
corpse. She held no conversation with
any one except the trainmen and only
spoke to them when it was absolutely
necessary.
About two hours before the train
reached here a porter heard a moan
ing sound from her berth and asked
if she wanted anything. She answered
that she did not. An hour later, fear-
ing that the woman needed something,
the porter called at the berth and
found the woman in a sitting posture
and dead.
Although no poison could be found,
the theory of suicide is advanced be
cause several pieces of paper were
found bearing the scribbled addresses
and her name, marked in care of Mrs.
O. B. Chase of Alameda. Mrs. Chase
is supposed to be a sister.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 23.âMiss Mary C.
McKee, a member of a prominent fam
ily of this city, died suddenly this
morning on a passenger train in New
Mexico while on her way home to
Alameda from New York. Intelligence
of her unexpected death was received
here to-day in a telegram from an
Albuquerque undertaker to Mrs. S. B.
Chase, a sister of the deceased, inform
ing her that the body of Miss McKee
had been taken from the train at that
point and would be held awaiting in
structions. The cause of death was not
given in the dispatch, but it is pre
sumed by the young woman's brother,
John I. McKee of this city, that she
Buecumbed to pneumonia.
Miss McKee had traveled much
abroad and throughout the United
States. She left here last September
to visit the St. Louis Exposition and
later went to New York, where she was
the guest of friends for four months.
Borne days ago Miss McKee wrote to
Mrs. Chase that she had been 111 and
Intended to start for home as soon as
she could travel. Orders have been
sent to Albuquerque to forward the re
mains to this city.

LOSES HIS WAY
IN MOUNTAINS
Chicago Professor Spends
Chilly Night on the Hills
Back of City of Honolulu
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Jan. 17.âGeorge Mead,
a professor in Chicago University, lost
his' way in' the mountains back of
Honolulu and was forced to spend a
chilly night out of doors before aid
reached him. He came here recently
on a visit to his brother-in-law, G. B.
Castle. He had started off on a walk
up Manoa. When dinner time arrived
and Mead was not on hand the family
became concerned and the police were
asked to take a hand in finding him.
Two mounted patrolmen were detailed
on the case, one taking the upper and
the other the lower road.
Without saying anything about it to
Mead's friends, several Japanese in the
employ of the Castles started up the
valley on a search on their own ac
count. Early next morning Mead was
found, none the worse for wear, but de
cidedly chilly and somewhat hungry.
Of the returning party, two of the Jap
anese walked off a precipice and Mead
had a narrow escape from following
them. One of the Japanese was badly
injured.
Mead lost his way among the con
fusing trails and darkness fell before
he was able to locate his path.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.âThe ses

"HOLY CITY"
NOT REALLY A
MASTERPIECE
VETERAN WHO OPENS IN "THE
BONNIE BRIER BUSH" AT THE
GRAND SUNDAY.
Author Says It Is,
but Critic Finds
It heavy,
"Genius has given to the stage many
plays of wonderful dramatic power to
thrill the hearts of listening thousands.
She has laid upon the altar of histrion-i
ie art plays that showed, with the ut
most truth to nature, the inner work
ings of men's minds and hearts, the
true and living motives of their actions.
She has given us plays that roll back
the centuries, etc. * * * But it has
remained for the author of 'THE
HOLY CITY' "âcapitals, please, Mr.
Printerâ"to unite the crowning glories
of all these in one grand triumph of
dramatic art!"
Mr. Gordon goes onâit is his play,
he ought to know: "A play that,
judged alone by its dramatic power and
merit, would take its place among the
world's great masterpieces " and so
on for seven pages and a "half.
It is always Interesting to know what
an author thinks of his own work
it is so usually and engagingly differ
ent from what you think. I can't say
that I whoHy agree with Mr. Gordon
here, for example. 1 saw his play up at
the Central last night, in charge of a
company that can turn its hand to any
thing from minstrels to John the Bap
tists, and of a management that would
have hastened to supply gilded dish
clouts if such were needed.
In spite of these, "The Holy City"
failed to startle, so far as Mr. Gordon
goes. Ah" masterpiece it is distinctly
off the y board. Even with Herschel
Mayall "perfectly angel"âvide the girl
behindâin white tights and a toga.
Myrtle Vane in pink tights and a span
gle or two, and a life-size head of John
the Baptist spotlighted on a charger,
the play failed to impress as a triumph
of dramatic art.
Mr. Gordon, however; begins well.
His play is fashioned of the New Testa-
i ment material, heavily edited, with all
of the chief characters except the
| Christ in the cast. lis rtrst act, which
includes the dancing of Salome before
Herod and the beheading of John the
i Baptist, convinces in the biblical melo
dramatic fashion,
j The scene enchants. The manage
j ment has given it costumes richly pic
; turesque, a seductive ballet and picture
I and lighting effects of which it may
well be proud. Miss Myrtle Vane as
Salome, in her hair and the aforesaid
tights and spangled veil, is a distinct
sensation. Miss Vane, in fact, devel
ops as an uncommonly clever young
woman. Her dance ia sufficiently fetch
ing to explain Herod's enthusiasm,
and even when she has to say "I am a
daughter of a. hundred kings," you
don't remember "A Working Girl's
Wrongs" against her. Miss Vane will
bear watching.
The whoje scene goes well and is full (
of action. Griffith presents
much to the good in it, a sincere and
i effective John the Baptist, and Henry
Shumer as Caiaphas and James Lori
gan as Andrew both lend dignity and
conviction to the parts/
The head on the charger is done by
"itself"âas they say at the Orpheum.
It is grewsomely like the real thing,
but they spare" us the blug. One rather
wishes they hadn't when Elizabeth
picks it up by the forelock and flaps
it in Salome's face. It Is so Impossibly
clean. But then one wishes Elizabeth
didn't flap it around that way.
The reÃt of the play, with its labori
ous reference to the presence of the
Christ, is like "Hamlet" without Ham
let. As Mr. Gordon says: "Right here
we wish to note that the character of
our Savior is not presented or person
ated by an actor, but is represented
solely by wonderful light and art ef
fects." Well, all that can be said is
that the representation fails of its pur
pose. At no time does one get the il
lusion of the presence of Christ in "The
Holy City," as one got it so vitally in
the little "Passion Play at Santa
Clara." Neither has any act save the
first any dramatic value.
The rest consist of short dialogues
and scenes between different sets of
the characters with almost no contin
uity of action.
Much praise, however, goes to the
actors almost throughout the large
cast. Besides those already noted
Juliet Crosby was stately and impres
sive as Herodias and was most warm
ly welcomed on her reappearance.
Ernest Howell was an earnest and con
vincing' Judas; Walter Shannon a par
ticularly picturesque and virile Pontius

New Congressional Bill Calls

TO REPORT A SCHEME
Intimated That California
Otherwise Will Get Small
Part of What She Asks
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.âThe River
and Harbor bill, which has been in the
course of preparation for many weeks,
is almost ready to be reported to the
House by Chairman Burton of the
River and Harbor Committee. What
it may have in store for California no
man can yet state, although it is inti
mated that its provisions will be small
compared to her demands and needs.
A provision has been inserted in the
bill at the Instance of Representative
McLachlan, appointing a commission
composed of three army engineers, who
will examine the Sacramento River,
confer with the authorities of Califor
nia and report upon a scheme for im
proving the navigability of the river in
co-operation with the State and the
National reclamation service in their
plans for river improvement and recla
mation in the Sacramento Valley.
Pilate and Mr. Mayall did all with his
opportunities for the part of Marius.
Julia Blanc as Elizabeth and Edna
Ellsmere as Mary Magdalene were both
useful.
As before said the costumes are
splendid and beautiful and the scenes
excellent examples of the scenic ar
tist's work. The pictures alone are
worth seeing, the acting is more worth
seeing, but still that doesn't make
"The Holy City" a "masrepriece."
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Grand Opera-House.
There was an excellent attendance
at the performance of "The Silver
Slipper" at the Grand Opera-house
last night. Snitz Edwards, in the role
of the showman, was particularly well
received.
In comparing the methods of latter
day actors with those of the old school,
Mr. J. H. Stoddart, the dean of the
American stage, who comes to the
Grand Opera-house next Sunday mati
nee on his farewell tour in "The Bon
nie Brier Bush," said recently:
When I see the young actors who have been
on the stage a year or so at the most so cer
tain of themselves, so confident of their pow
ers, I envy them. I am an old man, with
nearly three-quarters of a century of experi
ence, and it amazes rrc to see young actors
laugh and joke in the wings and then go on
and take up their parts. In the olden days
we were brought up in a hard but correct
school; one that taught the actors to hold their
art loyally, to l*Â» fearful of themselves. I
cannot understand the assurance of the mod
ern player. Every night I sit in my dressing
room and go over all the lines of my part
alter I am "made up. ' and even then I am
always fearful, and I have played Lachlan,
Campbell in "The Bonnie Brier Bush" for
four years now.
,1 am never satisfied with myself. "Have I
got all out of this part that the author in
tended?" I keep saying, and I worry. And
then when I go on the stage this uncertainty
still pursues me. It makes me nervous that
I may not do my best, that I may not please
the public before me.
The only consolation I have Is that so many
of the really good actors, the men I look up
to and admire, were thus troubled. Macready
would go to his dressing-room two hours be
fore the time for the curtain to rise in.order
that he might get himself In the proper frame
of mind for the part he was to play, and you
could hear him groaning all over the apace
behind the curtain, he was so nervous and
dispirited. And then In his diary, how full of
criticisms of himself. "Appeared as Hamlet
last night. Acted very badly."
Here was shown the modesty and
lack of self praise of this great old
actor, with seventy years of the most
varied stage life to look back upon;
with seventy years of triumph to re
ward him. He has played all the im
portant roles In the old repertory, many
of those in the modern one, and is still
as anious to please the public as in the
olden days.
Alcazar.
A splendid production of "The Con
querors" was given last night at the
Alcazar. The play, which revolves
around a story of the Franco-Prussian
war, contains much of interest and was
presented in a manner that delighted a
large audience. All the characters were
weH sustained by the capable members
of the stock company and the produc
tion showed evidence of careful stage
management. Especially was this true
of the mob scene in the second act.
The scenic features, too, aided in the
success achieved. John Craig was a
manly Eric and played the part with
his usual virility, although he would
improve on his work were he to modu
late his voice at times. Luke Conness
was perfectly at home as the Baron of
Grandpre, winning the plaudits of his
hearers. Lillian Lawrence was quite
equal to the part of Yvonne and Miss

BRYAN TAKES
HOPEFUL VIEW
Says That He Sees Signs of

Victory at Next Election
ROOSEVELT IS PRAISED
Desires That Minority Aid
President in the Reforms
He Is Laboring to Effect
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Jan. 23.âWil
liam J. Bryan was the guest of honor
at a dollar ..banquet given to-night.
Bryan made it an occasion for indicat
ing the reason why the Democratic
party was so overwhelmingly defeated
in the last campaign and also stated
what seemed to him signs of promise
for a Democratic victory in the next
Presidential campaign. He said:
Taking away the personal popularity of Mr.
Rooeevejt in the campaign, there would be
much left In the results to encourage the
Democrats. For a quarter of a century the
Government haa been drifting farther and
farther from the people and boss rule and cor
ruption have been increasing. But It was a
good sign that the independent voter asserted
hlmsejif In the last election. And I have been
surprised at evidences of help that the radical
element Is getting since that election. We ;
have found persona, whom we did not suspect I
of such a tendency, helping along good Demo
cratic ways. '
When 1 was invited recently* to speak be- j
fore the Senate of corruption-ridden Indiana
I preached good Democratic doctrines on two I
texts, one taken from the message of the out- â 
going Republican Governor and the other taken '
from the message of the Incoming Republican ,
Governor. And Indiana is one of the most
corrupt States, with all due deference to the ;
pride you have In your own Connecticut.
Some one here to-night asked me how Tol
stoi could live In Russia and preach his doc
trine of reform. Perhaps it Is because he
could nowhere else find such excellent ground
to study tyranny and despotism. Wrong, as
it develops, brings Its own remedy, and In
this country within the next four years will
come the movement to bring back power to
the people.
In President Roosevelt himself there have
been symptoms of reform that I had for one,
no suspicion of. I scanned his conduct and
did not believe that reform was to be expected
from him. But since election he has done
several things. First, he announced that he
would not again be a candidate for the Presi
dency. That gave him Independence. I read
In his message his views about publication of
campaign contributions. That will do more
than anything else to clean up campaigning.
Then he recommended more power for the In- i
terstate Commerce Commission.
T want fhe Democratic party to forget itself j
and to help the- President carry out whatever
is good. If we help him and he does not sue- ;
ceed he wIU nevertheless help us to educate i
the public as we could not alone. And then, j
we can make a stronger flÂ«ht tour years hence.

Bold Attempt Is Made to
Learn Secrets of Body In

OFFICIAL DISAPPEARS
! After Absence of Two Days
Secretary Is Found in His
Room in a Muddled State
A Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Jan. 23. âLand fraud
investigations are being carried on so
persistently by Prosecuting Attorney
Heney that every means is being used
to learn the Government secrets. The
most open attempt so far Is the drug
ging "of Carl Phelps, secretary of the
Federal grand Jury.
Phelps was chosen for his position
as he was believed to be unapproach
able. Two days ago he disappeared
from view and was not found again
till this morning, when the bailiff of
the court went to his room and found
him lying on the bed in a stupor, with
all his clothes on. Indications were
that he had just come, or had been
carried home.
The officials believe that men un
der suspicion of land fraud have hired
secret agents to drug Phelps.and learn
the future actions of the jury. Just
what Phelps divulged is as yet not
known, as he has not yet sufficiently
recovered to tell where he was during
his absence.

PETALUMA, Jan. 23.âTwo mer

Saturday night by means of raised
money orders. The time for bunkoing
the merchants was well chosen, aa In
quiry was thus postponed until Mon
day morning when the postoffice
opened. By this time the smooth
operators had a long start of the of
ficers and their apprehension is doubt
ful.
A. Nauer, a grocer, took an order
that had been raised from $1 to $50
and gave up $4 worth of provisions
and $46 in coin. Ross" store gave $6
worth of stock and $15 in cash, ac
cepting a due bill and a money order
for $50 as security. Both orders were
signed to George Payton, to whom
they were made payable. The swindlers
came into town in a wagon. The of
ficials are making an investigation.

THREE PROMINENT MEMBERS
OF THE L.E-IIS LATERE NOW IN
SESSION AT SACRAMENTO.
â¢ Special Dispatch to The Call.
, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 23. âA protest,
bristling with indignation, was filed in
both houses of the Legislature to-day
against Assemblyman McGowan's bill
which aims to repeal certain portions
and amend others ol the existing medi
cal tew. The protest was filed by the
Santa Clara County Medical Society,
the headquarters of which are at San
Jose.. The protest is in the form of a
resolution and is unsparing in its de
nunciation of the purpose of the bill
its the society sees it. The protest in
part is as follows:
A bill has been introduced in th? legislature
rj( California known as Assembly bill No. 2117,
repealing parts of tha present medical law,
af'i stiostitttting Other measures.
The present medical law I* entirely satis
factory to the ohysleians of Santa Clara
County and to the great mass of the medical
prQieMion throughout California
â¢ Assembly bill No. 207> nÂ« ts with the un
qualified cer.rt-mnatlen cf this society and all
r>rÂ»utHhle physicians of Santa Clara County,
and oar re'prfscntatives in the legislature are
Instructed and urged to use every possible en-
Oeavor to defeat the passage of said bill, to
gether with all similar attempts to alter,
â mend or repeal the existing statute.
Among th" many r-as'>ns !cr this action are
the followin-:
"itr l medical lew is in every way ad
equate to thÂ» ne<-ds of thÂ» people of the Str.te
of.California The proposed law, as contained
in Assembly bill No. 2Â«7.- Is vicious In its
character, in that It seeks to pull down and
destroy the safeguards which the people of
th'Â« State hav<- the right to expect and de
mand for their well being. \
T'nder the present law every candidate ta
practice medicine, regardless of where ho
graduated, must first undergo a fair examina
tion testing his knowledge before a Ilrense to
practice is given him. With a sham pretense
of local patriotism bill No. 267. while subject
ing graduates cf time-honored medical schools
of the East fe examination, would exempt
â¢ from this ordeal the ignorant output of ques

disgraced before the decent medical fraternity,
the proprietors of these obnoxious institutions
are the very persons behind and pushing As
sembly bill 267.
t'nder the existing statutes of California any
body of five men may unite and incorporate a
medical college and lawfully confer degrees
and issue diplomas. Should said Assembly
bill No. 267 become a law it will encourage
the establishment of new diploma mills under
the guise of "legally chartered medical col
leges," whose output, limited only by the en
terprising and mercenary greed of Its proprie
tors, would receive certificates from a State
board to practice medicine on presentation of
such diplomas, and go forth and overrun the
State, becoming a curse to the communities
in which they may locate and a debasement of
medical practice.
The proposed legislation is also actively ad
vocated by parties who. although holding di
plomas from "legally incorporated mÂ»dlcal
colleges," as termed In said Assembly bill No.
2t'.7, having received an insufficient medical
education therein, have repeatedly failed In
tests of proficiency in examinations before the
Stat?-Foard of Medical Examiners.
The representation on the Board of Exam
iners under the present law Is five regulars,
(allopaths), two homeopaths, two eclectics.
This Is numerically fair and just to all con
cerned. In the fa< c of official figures taken
from the State Register of Physicians and
Surgeons, showing 'hat there have been issued
licences to the number of to regulars. fÂ»1l
to hrmeopaths and (Vis t i e<-iccths. said As
sembly bill N'i. 217. dlsrepardful of the fact
that there are ttfCT time? as many regulars as
of combined and eclectics, who
will undergo examination for licenses, pur
poses to makÂ» th" Riard of Examiners consist
of three regulars, three homeopaths and three
eclectics.
t'nder thÂ° present law the members of the
of Examiners are chosen by the three
State medical societies, and these men enjoy
the esteem and resn.ct rrf the entire medical
pro'ession. Assembly bill No. 207 puts th"
appointing power of thÂ° members of the board
In th" hands of the Governor, thus bringing
the Issuing of licenses to practice m'dleine
Into the realm of politics with its dubious
treil i>f natronaire
This bill, it is apparent from the fore
going: resolution, means that the three
established schools of medicine are
ready for another clash and it is prob
able that the eclectics and homeo
paths will be heard from in terms
equally strong before the bill comes up
for final action.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 24. 1905.
ANTI-PRIZEFIGHT
MEASURE GAINING
SUPPORT OF SOLONS
Cry for Clean Sport
Is Made by Many
Legislators.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 23.âRalston's
anti-prize flgfct bill is gaining- support
as the days pass. It is expected that it
will be returned this week by the Sen
ate Committee on Public Morals and
placed on the file for final action by the
upper house. Senator Markey of San
Francisco, when he returned from San
Francisco last evening, said he was
confident that a majority at least o-f
the San Francisco delegation was in
favor of the bill and that ne was posi
tive that Nelson, Keane and French
would join with him in supporting the
measure.
"I believe the bill should be passed," i
said Markey, "and forever end the job- '
bing and robbery that has marked the
progress of pugilism in California. 1 do
not believe that an honest prize fight I
has taken place in San Francisco in j
years. There is crooked work in all of i
them and it is an outrage that San I
Francisco should be placed at the dis- 1
posal of these looters."
When the Senate went into session
this morning Senator Ralston filed for
printing in the journal a resolution
adopted by the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation which strongly commends for '
adoption the anti-prize fight bill. The !
resolution confirms the theory of the ,
author of the bill that under existing I
conditions the so-called amateur box- j
ing contests given monthly in San
Francisco are a disgrace to the State j
and that the professional bouts are
even a greater reflection on the moral
being of California's citizens. In con- j
elusion the resolution asks that the i
members of the Legislature give their
unanimous support to the bill that the j
purpose of legitimate athletic associa- !
tions may be furthered and all classes j
of legitimate sport cleansed of the ele- '
ment that is now disgracing them.
SECRET INVESTIGATION.
Tontine Policy Concerns Under Fire
at Capital.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 24.âUntil
nearly 1 o'clock this morning the Sen
ate Committee on Retrenchment and
Reform sat behind closed 'doors in a !
room at Sergeant at Arms Martin's
residence listening to testimony in con
section with alleged fraudulent invest- '
ment companies. Two tontine policy
concerns were especially under fire.
A number of witnesses had been sub
â¢penaed from San Francisco. It was |
found when the tontine men arrived
that they had not brought their firm
hooks, though an order had issued for
then to do so. They were questioned ;
at great length by various members of
the committee.

EDISON UNDER
DOCTOR'S KNIFE
NEW YORK. Jan. 24.âA critical
surgical operation has been performed
on Thomas A. Edison at his home
near Orange, N. J. Great secrecy
was maintained by the family in re
gard to the affair, and few details
could be obtained.
The operation was for a mastoid ab
scess behind the ear and very close to
the brain.
As is generally known the inventor
has been deaf for many years and the
affliction has been growing worse. He
has been suffering considerably for
about a week and the matter of an
operation was broached several days
ago, but there was strong hope that it
might be avoided.
it develop* d, however, that while Mr.
Edison was better in many particulars,
the growth was not yielding to treat
ment, and th? conclusion was reached
that the operation would have to be
performed at once. It was begun late
last night and was not finished until
an early hour this morning, having oc
cupied more than two hours.
Mr. Edison, who is 57 years old, re
mained up and about until a few hours
before Ihe operation began.

No Profit in Freaks.
It is announced by the new hippo
drome management that "freaks" will
not be hired and that the public no
longer cares to see human abnormali
tier and deformities. The ossified
man, the bearded woman, the four
legged boy and the original rubber
neck can no longer make large in
comes by exhibiting themselves to a
curious public There was a time
when a good freak would receive $125
or $150 a week for sitting on a plat
form. The proprietors of the hippo
drome and other large shows presum
ably do not exclude freaks for any
other motive but that their exhibition
is not profitable. It has been proved
by the experiments of the last two
years at Coney Island that the more
respectable an entertainment and the
more it appeals to the average well
conducted American household the
more profitable it is.
It is a good sign of public develop
ment. âNew York World.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 23.âSenator
Keane of San Francisco presented two
bills thi3 morning that will center the
interest of the members of the School I
Department of San Francisco until i
tmal action upon them has been taken. ;
The bills call fur the apportionment of ,

San Francisco on a basis of $55u for
each teacher per annum. Whili- the ;
total amount each an allowance would
net San Francisco is not set forth in
the bill, it is said that it will foot up i
to something like $t>oo,ooo.

fh< bill intiouacvd uy hoggins au
thorizing th-- Federal Government to
lower the witter levels of Little Klam
ath, Tult, Goose and Clear lakes, situ
ated in Siskiyou and Modoc counties,
also ceding to the United States all !
title and interest the State may have 1
to any land;; uncovered by the lowering j
of the water levels, precipitated a de- |
bate In the Senate this morning.
Curtin. to whom the words "cede" j
and "re-cede" are always signals of the
gravest danger, wanted to know why
the State should cede the land uncov
ered by the lowering of the levels of |
the lakes to the Federal Government.
Rowell pointed out that as a matter
of fact the State would do nothing of
the kind, because the State could not 1
give the Government something it al- j
ready owned and it was admitted that
title to th<- beds of such bodies of
water is already vested in the United
States. Furthermore, Rowell said, the j
State could well afford to give up what
is nÂ«v, useless in order that It might
li â  enriched by the future operations
of the Government. After this discus
sion the bill was passed for the day,
retaining its position on the file.
Curtin is th-" leader of the opponents
of the bill to re-cede the Yosemite Val
ley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove :
and he is keeping a watchful eye on j
al! "cede" and "re-cede" abills.

The bill appropriating $70,000 for the
maintenance of a State exhibit at the
Lewis and Clark Exposition at Port
land was also finally passed by the
upper House and sent to the Assembly
for its action.
Senator Selvage presented a proposed
constitutional amendment fixing ses
sions of the Legislature at eighty days,
the compensation of members thereof
at $10 a day and limiting the patronage
to $500 a day for each House.
A resolution adopted by the Mer-.
chants' and Producers' Association of
San Francisco commending the Yosem

in the journal.
A resolution from the California
Woman's Club asking that the Legisla
ture enact a law placing the entire
burden of the maintenance of proba

the various countries in which such
probation officers are located was also
ordered printed in the journal.

Special Dispatch to The Call â
SACRAMENTO," Jan. 23.âWhen the
Assembly reached the third reading 1 of
bilis this mornin_ there were no bill
files before the members for consulta- ;
tion. The bills had come from IJie j
printer, but they had not been filed. I
Stanton asked that under the circum
stances the third reading be post- j
poned. This was ordered and an or- j
der was also issued to the sergeant at
arms that he put every unattached ,
employe that he could find at the i
work of tiling the bills that the mem- J
bf.rs might not fail to have them on
their desks in future when sessions â¢
opened. If there is another such ora- j
mission there will be trouble for the j
attaches.
When the second reading of bills
was called Atkinson moved that that
ulso go over. "Without the files in .
front of us," he said, "we cannot know
jtst what every bill is and if we have
any objection to make we must make |
them on second reading."
Atkinson's motion did not prevail
and the second reading was taken up.
The Assembly is well into the work of
passing bills now and many are on the
third and second reading files.
O'Brien'of Sacramento, whose reso
lution to appoint arfassistant to the
bookkeeper of the sergeant at arms
had been reported favorably, asked
permission to withdraw the resolution.
The present temper of the House will
not permit of the making of any more

McCartney as chairman of the Rules
i'nd Regulations Committee, submitted
a proposition that during this week,
cxc epting to-day and Saturday, the As

members adopted it.
Speaker Prescott announced Devlin
and Drew as additional members of
the Judiciary Committee.
An adjournment was taken until 10
o'clock to-morrow morning.
A bill providing for the erection and
maintenance of a State hospital for

Walsh presented a measure provid
ing for an appropriation of $25,000 to
maintain , a school of forestry at the
State university.
Anthony introduced a bill aimed to
make the recall law applicable to the
entire State. The recall is a method
of removing officials by popular vote.
The Judiciary Committee decided **>-
day to report favorably the bill refund
ing to those who paid them without
protest the taxes levied to build a new
hospital and new schools in San Fran
cisco under a provision afterward de
clared illegal by the court. City At
torney Long of San Francisco advo
cated the relief bill before the commit
tee. Those who paid the tax under
protest recovered their money in court.
Consternation struck a majority of
the Assemblymen to-night when it was
announced that the controller had
made the discovery that the last batch
of attaches certified as having been ap
pointed by a three-fifths vote of the
lower house had not received this num
ber and hence their appointment would
not stand. To-morrow the resolution
will again be brought up, but it is be
lieved that the opposition will muster
sufficient strength to finally defeat it, .

System for Selling Cigarettes.
Systems have been devised by which,
with the aid of a single clerk, a more
minute and accurate record can be kept
of a great business house than -could
be kept by a large force of accountants.
A good example of a perfect system is
the one used by a firm of cigarette
makers who have a private trade, for
they make their goods to order for in
dividual customers. The characteristic
feature of their business is that they
mix the tobacco to suit each individual
customer's taste. They must have dl- j
rect communication with their patrons
and these patrons' buy as few as 500
cigarettes at a time. To get their trade
is easy; to hold it is more difficult. On
their flies they carry a memoranda of
th j tastes of perhaps 2000 smokers and
the formula of the mixture which suits
every one best, together with a 'esign
of his crest or monogram, which he
desires stamped on his wrappers. Every
customer's daily consumption is noted
and by the automatic operation of their
system his name comes to the front
a week before he may be reasonably
expected to have exhausted his last or- j
dpr. So nicely has this system been
adjusted that recently, during a spell
of extremely humid weather, when or- j
dors could not be filled, every customer j
found his wants supplied, during this
pfriod of waiting, from a stock kept
on hand for the purpose.âWorld's

ings ever held by the organization, and

hour this morning to end their work,
so that they might start on their jour
ney home to-day.

fett in recognition for his services as
editor of the official journal for the
last six years. It was decided to
change the place of publishing the
journal from New York to Indianapolis.

conditions that now exist.
A testimonial in the shape of a ban
ner mounted on a bicycle wagon was

AMERICAN EMBASSADORS
TO LIVE IN MONUMENTS
A movement is on foot among Amer
ican citizens in Paris to raise a sub
scription fund for the purchase of a
mansion in that city to be presented to
the United States Government aa a
home for the American embassy. It
would be a handsome monument to the
patriotic loyalty of the American col
ony, but it is a matter of regret that
this Government has permitted the op
portunity for such a movement to ex
ist. Better far that some of the public
building schemes in this country be
allowed to wait for a while and that
the Government should have in each of
the leading capitals fltÂ» homes for its
Embassadors and their families. It
should not be necessary for the repre
sentative of this Government to any
one of the Important courts of Europe
to be able to ppend more than his sal
ary each year for the single item of
house rent, so that the first requisite
to be considered in the selection of
such representtaive must be his finan
cial resources. There should be in each
capital an American embassy of a
style befitting the country It represents
and when the movement starts in the
direction of this object it ought to re
ceive indorsement of Americans at
home as well as abroad.âHaverhill

CHAN CHEUNG
OUT ON BAIL
Justice Henshaw of Supreme
Court Overrules Protest
of the District Attorney
Justice Henshaw of the Supreme
Court yesterday ordered that Chan
Cheung be admitted to bail in the
sum of $25,000. The court heard
the testimony on which the Grand
Jury returned the indictment accusing
the wealthy Chinese with complicity
In the murder of Tom Tick, but each
of the three witnesses acknowledged
that he had signed the agreement of
the tongs offering rewards for the
heads of all members of the "Educa
â tional Society," thereby placing him
self in the position of co-conspirator
with Chan Cheung and nullifying the
testimony.
Furthermore, in trials of the con
spirators in the Superior Court, one
of the witnesses had committed per
jury, as he himself admitted, by de
nying on one occasion that he was a
party to the tong agreement to pay
for the murder of the "Educational"
men. The other two witnesses had
never made mention of Chan Cheung's
participation in the meeting at which
the rewards were offered and guaran
teeing their payment until the recent
indictment by the Grand Jury, not
withstanding that there had been
several hearings and trials in court.
â¢Justice Henshaw asked the District
Attorney whether he did not think, on
the showing made, that the prisoner
should be allowed the privilege of bail.
Byington was not inclined to dispute
â¢ the analysis of the case by the court,
but from what he knew of the de
fendant, he said, and from a personal
conviction that Chan Cheung did take
part in instigating the killing of Tom
Yick, he would still Insist that the pe
tioner be remanded to the custody of
the Sheriff.
"We'll hang Chan Cheung for the
murder of Tom Yick." declared Dis
trict Attorney Byington in a colloquy
with ex-Governor Budd, after court
had adjourned.
"We'll show that your so-called 'Ed
ucational Society' is a school for per
jury," was the bristling rejoinder of
chief counsel for Chan Cheung.
Chan Cheung, was released last
night on a bond of $25,000 approved
by Superior Judge Carroll Cook.

BURNS MONEY
HE GAVE HER
Librada Morales Lights Her
Cigarettes With Suitor's
Four Fifty-Dollar Bills
Senorita Librada Morales had money
to burn last night and she lit cigar
ettes with it. She thought that four
$50 Mexican notes given in trust to her
by her sweetheart,' Antonio Morales,
were Confederate. In her indignation
at his giving her such worthless stuff
she sent the money up in smoke.
Antonio arrived yesterday from Mex
ico and immediately sought his dark
eyed querida at her casa near Broad
way and Kearny street. To her he
gave four $50 bills to keep for wedding
day expenses. Librada proudly dis
played the wealth to her neighbors. In
stead of gazing at it in envy they
laughed. "Why, that is no good," they
said. "That is not Americano dinero.
It's no money at all."
"Caramba!" cried the haÃty tempered
Librada. "Antonio gives to me the
ha-ha and the laugh of the horse, does
he? I will show him. Behold, I. Libra
da. have money to burn. Behold, I
burn it."
AVith the melodramatic grace of a
spaghetti opera company's Carmen,
she lifted a cigarette to her lips and,
lighting one of the bills, ignited her
cigarillo therewith. She smoked four
cigarettes and with them Antonio's
200 pesos also vanished in vapor.
When Antonio returned Librada re
ceived him with the chilly hauteur of a
frozen oyster. "Come, querida," he
cried. "We will go and burn some of
that dinero."
"It is already burned," announced
Librada. "It is what the Amerjcanos
call phoney."
"Caramba!" shouted Antonio. "You
burn 200 pesos." And he caught his
beloved by her jet black locks and
called for the police. The lady who
had money to burn weeps in the City
Prison over the conflagration of pesos.
She is charged with felony embezzle
ment. Antonio will return to Mexico,
where cigarette lighters for lady
friends are cheaper.
PANAMA NO PLACE FOR
AMERICAN WORKINGMEN
R. P. Cooke, Government Draughts
man, Says White Men Cannot
Survive Conditions There.
Among the recent arrivals at the
Occidental Is R. P. Cooke, an architect
of New York, who has just returned
from Panama, where he was em
ployed in the Government draughting
department in connection with the
canal. He was Invalided home and
does not purpose returning to the
isthmus. In discussing the conditions
on the isthmus Cooke says that Pan
ama is no place for a white man at
present unless he has been accus
tomed to a malarial climate. Scarcity
of food other than rice and bananas,
which are invariably served to Amer
icans in fat, and lack of proper quar
ters for the men engaged in the canal
work, with bad water increased sick
ness on the isthmus and forced many
men into the Government hospital.
Cooke says that the high tax on all
imported goods, especially foodstuffs,
places the latter beyond the reach of
the Americans, whose wages will not
permit them to buy ordinary necessi-
ties of life. Although the Government
commission has planned to furnish its
employes comfortable quarters, pure
water and good food, it has yet failed
to effect these things and as a conse
quence many Americans are going to
the isthmus under the misapprehen
sion that they are to be well provided
for. On the contrary, the only places
in which men can And shelter are in
the old shanties left by the French
commission and in tents.
High Rent Causes Eviction.
Mrs. F. Marion Wells, wife of the
late famous sculptor who died in pen
ury at the City and County Hospital
about eighteen months ago, was yes
terday evicted from a lodging-house
that she has been conducting at 633
Broadway. Soon after the death of
Wells one of his old friends installed
the widow in the boarding-house. Ac
cording to her story everything went
well until the lease of the building
was secured by J. Lafarque. Mrs.
Wells says that Lafarque tripled her
rent and she was unable to pay the
exorbitant demand. A debt of $330
accumulated in two months and when
she refused to pay it the attachment
was Issued and served by Deputy
Sheriff Jesse Galland.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1905.
WIFE'S ACTION
ENRAGES HIM
Witnesses Say Campbell Was
Driven to Desperation by
Spouse Whom He Killed
TESTIFY FOR DEFENSE
Bartender Who Kept Com
pany With Woman Tells;
I of a Beating Given Him
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
1016 Broadway, Jan. 23. I
The trial of Lemuel D. Campbell, j
[ charged with the murder of his wife,
I was continued this morning, the de- i
â  fense beginning its side of the case. |
I The first witness called was Council- |
[ man George Fitzgerald, who testified
[/that he knew Campbell well, that he
met him on the afternoon of the mur-..
j der and that Campbell failed to recog
; nize him. Campbell was acting in a :
strangely abstracted manner, but after ,
he was spoken to returned the saluta- I
tion.
Joseph Fossati, a bartender at the I
Venetian Gardens on Seventh street,
testified that after the separation of \
Campbell and his wife he had "kept 1
company" with her. Campbell had [
asked him about it and the witness told )
him that he had been with Mrs. Camp- I
bell. Campbell knocked him down and
gave him a black eye. He said he con
fessed this to Campbell because he was
afraid of him.
The last witness to testify was C. E.
Young, butcher, for whom Campbell
worked. Campbell's mother-in-law had
come to him and tried to get him to
discharge Campbell. He also said that
both Mrs. Campbell and her mother
often rang up the shop and disturbed
Campbell and provoked him.
CHAIRMAN MITCHELL
GOES TO SACRAMENTO
President of Board of Supervisors to
Confer With Legislative Delega
tion on Mattei-s of Salaries.
OAKLAND, Jan. 23.âThe Board of
Supervisors to-day voted to send
Chairman John Mitchell as its repre
sentative to Sacramento to confer
with members of the Alameda County
delegation touching the question of
proposed changes in the working force
and salaries of county officials. The
conference is called for to-morrow.
This action was taken in response to a
request from the delegation that a
representative of the board meet with
them at Sacramento.
The board appropriated $500 for use
by the Merchants' Exchange in pro
moting immigration into Alameda
County.
Hereafter no Supervisor will be per
mitted to incur expenditures greater
than $25 without specific authoriza
tion from the board in open meeting.
FINDS NEGRO MURDERER
TO HAVE BEEN INSANE
Coroner's Jury Investigates Slaying of
Aged Mary Callendei*âFerguson
Had a Thick Skull.
OAKLAND, Jan. 23.âA Coroner's
jury to-night found that James Fer
guson, the negro cook who killed Mrs.
Mary L. Callender, an ased negress,
yesterday at the Callender home, 179
Third street, and afterward killed
himself, was insane.
The hospital surgeons found that
Ferguson had died from a fracture of
the skull caused by the two bullets
that he fired, one into each side of his
head. The skull was so thick that
the bullets did not penetrate the
brain, but the Impact caused the frac
ture, produced a fatal hemor
rhage. This explained why Ferguson
lived for three hours after wounding
himself in such a way that ordinarily
he must have been instantly killed.
RECEIVES FATAL INJURIES
IN COLLISION WITH A CAR
H. J. O'Keefe Is Thrown From Wag
on, His Neck Broken and His
Body Paralyzed.
OAKLAND, Jan. 23.â H. J. O'Keefe,
an electrician living at 654 Ninth
street, was thrown from a wagon this
afternoon in a collision with an elec
tric car at the corner of Nineteenth
street and San Pablo avenue and re
ceived injuries that will probably
prove fatal. O'Keefe was driving
across the tracks and did not see the
approaching car, which struck the
wagon, throwing him to the ground.
O'Keefe fell upon his head and was
picked up unconscious. He was tak
en to the Receiving Hospital, where it
was found that his neck had been
broken, the man's body being entirely
paralyzed from the shoulders down.
The surgeons have very little hope of
saving O'Keefe's life, although they
say that he may linger for several
days.
Killed by Escaping Gas.
OAKLAND. Jan. 23. â John P.
Flynn, 26 years old, was found dead
from .gas suffocation this morning in
his room at 1461 Seventh street. Flynn
had left the burner open after trying,
while intoxicated, to light the gas. His
mother, who conducts a coal yard at
1459 Seventh street, found the body,
which was taken in charge by the
Coroner. Flynn was unmarried. His
family has resided in West Oakland
for many years.
Will Fight the Open Shop.
OAKLAND, Jan. 23. âThe members
of the local Cooks' and Walters' Union
will meet to-morrow evening to con
sider what action shall be taken by
the union when the Restaurant Own
ers' Association declare for the "open
shop" on February 1. Many of the
union men have expressed the
mination to walk out if the "open
shop" is declared and they say that
the union is prepared to make a hard
fight for the preservation of present
conditions.
THREE NEW
PROFESSORS
INSTALLED
EDUCATOR WHO HAS BEEN ADD
ED TO THE FACULTY OF PA
CIFIC THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY.
Exercises at Pacific
Theological
Seminary.
BERKELEY, Jan. 23.âWith impres
sive ceremonies and addresses notable
for their tribute to modern thought,
three new professors of the Pacific
Theological Seminary were inducted
into office to-night at the First Con
gregational Church. The three pro
fessors are W. F. Bade, John Wright
Buckham and T. Cowden Laughlin.
The induction ceremonies were per
formed by President J. K. McLean of
the seminary. Addresses of greeting
were delivered by representative men
of the church. The audience-room was
crowded. Of unusual interest was the
inaugural address of Professor John
Wright Buckham, his subject being
"An Estimate of Evolution Theology
as Sot Forth by Joseph IÂ»e Conte."
There were indications of marked ani
mation in the audience of professors,
ministers and church people when Pro
fessor Buckham spoke, in part as fol
lows:
In the rntifie) though yet unwritten treaty
of peace which lias followed what we may
now term the lat>- unpleasantness between
science and theology two articles Of supreme
value are guaranteed. The first is the com
plete recognition of natural science. The sec
ond is the indlspensability of theology. Evo
lution impels the scientist to theology. Com
pleteness of thought requires it. Among those
who have attempted to ('instruct evolution
theology Joseph Le Conte is pre-eminent. His
"Evolution and Its Relation to Religious
Thought" has found wide and warm accept
ance. He himself deemed it hts most Import
ant work.
What are the contributions evolution has
made to theology as we find them In the
volume? The first is the truth of the Divine
Immanence. God is In his world. Evolution
has made impossible the absentee Ood who
can be eternalized and placated. Evolution did
not discover this truth of the dlvtne presence,
but it has widened and emphasized it. Again
evolution has taken away fie Idea of special
design in nature only to substitute cosmic de
sign, a design, as Professor Le Conte says,
"embracing all space and running through all
time." Evolution has also vastly enriched
and enlarged the conception of progress. This
is Its greatest service.
It is a significant fact that not only was
this scientist who did most to commend evolu
tion to modern religious thought a member
of the faculty of our honored University of
California, but so also is the philosopher who
has done most to expo*Â«e the limits of evolu
tion and to uphold the sacred worth of per
sonality which evolution over-'hadowsâProfessor
George H. Howison. Evolution has no recog
nition of a personal God. nor any explanation of
Jesus Christ, nor any just estimate of the real
ity of evil. The God who Is transcendent as
well as immanent, above his universe as well
as In It. the Christ who is an ideal leading
on and not simply a "resident force," evil as
an enemy to be overcome, rather than as good
in disguiseâof :heÂ«- evolution affords no sug
gestion.. It must be supplemented, else it
proves misleading.
Evolution is virtually established. But the
whole tendency, both from within and from
without, to-day Is to limit it. The day of pan
evolutlon has passed. Theology may take
whatever truth evolution has brought with the
consciousness that evolution has neither sunk
nor solved the old problems. What should we
do without these problems? They are full of
discipline. Nor are they wholly Insoluble.
New meanings gather about them. New lights
flash from them. Prayer rules In theology as
elsewhere through God's developing universe.
Professor W. F. Bade, in his inaug
ural address, spoke of "Old Testament
Scholarship in Modern Bible Teach
ing." Professor Laughlin's topic was
"The Pastoral Epistles in the Light
of One Roman Imprisonment."
Of the three professors inaugurated
great things are expected by the theo
logical seminary authorities. Profes
sor Bade is said to be a man of ex
traordinary scholarship. Professor
Laughlin has been Instructor in Bibli
cal /literature at Princeton. Dr. Buck
ham was pastor of a leading Congre
gational church at Salem, Mass., for
twelve years and his achievements in
scholarship are deemed noteworthy.
Master Bakers' Association.
A call has been issued for a meet
ing of all the master bakers in Cal
ifornia to be held at some date here
after to be set during next month,
when the proposition of the journey
men bakers to unionize boys about to
learn the trade will be discussed. A
schedule of. wages for journeymen
bakers and apprentices, with other
matters relating to the bakery busi
ness, will also come in for a general
review when the convention of the
Master Bakers' Association meets. The

dent, Nichols Prost; secretary-treas-

PRUNES DOWN
LAWYERS' FEES
The Adoption of Schedule of
Prices in Probate Matters
Creates General Dismay
OGDEX 3IAKES NEW RULE
Los Angeles Prices, Where
Lawyers Are Many and
Work Scarce, Are to Rule
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 23.
Somewhat of a sensation was sprung
upon the attorneys practicing at the
Alameda County bar when Judge Og
j den this morning announced that he
j should adopt the Los Angeles schedule
lof prices for probate matters. It means
a large cut in the fees heretofore al
j lowed. In previous years attorneys
j were sworn and interrogated in regard
to the amount and character of the
) work done and a fee allowed accord-
S ingly. Now, by the new fee system
' for estates of $1000 or less, there will be
allowed a fee of five per cent, and on
estates up to $10,000 two per cent.
Expressions of attorneys are to the
effect that the same conditions do not
obtain here as at Los Angeles. They
say the southern city is a Mecca for
invalid attorneys who work Just to
keep busy and that there are 1200 law
yers in the town with work for about
fifty, and that the keen competition has
forced rates down to much lesÃ than
the actual work is worth.
IMPROVEMENT
CLUBS DOING
GOOD WORK
Zoe Green Radcliffe
OAKLAND, Jan. 2U. â That it is much eas
ier for an improvement club to accomplish
things in a small town than in a big city was
demonstrated to-day by a clever little woman
from Vallejo, Mrs. Frank W. Gorham, who
addressed the Oakland Women's Civic Im
provement Club. She is president of a sister
organization in Vallejo that in the short four
years of its atlstence has done wonders for
that town. The club Includes 200 members
and to their energy and enterprise Is due a
long list of benefactions. Their first care, of
course, was to secure clean streets, for the
Vallejo Superintendent of Streets differed not
a bit from officials In bigger towns and was
too busy doing everything else to attend to the
work he was elected to do. Clever little
"weed letters," / sent wherever needed, called
attention to neglected gardens and lots, and
then when, also tffrough the club's efforts,
two garbage men had been added to the lone
scavenger hitherto deemed suiflclent by the
city fathers, Vallejo began to assume an en
couraging "spick and span" appearance and
the women branched out into greater things.
They saw to it that the streets were sprinkled,
they started school gardens, they gave a series
of open air band concerts during the summer,
they furnished the juvenile room in the new
Carnegie library and now, to encourase the
school spirit, they have established a debating
society in the High School and are offering a
gold and a sliver medal for the successful con
testants. So much for the town of Vallejo!
But the Civic Improvement Club of Oakland
has greater odds to combat than had the
women of Vallejo. In the first place the ef
forts of the Oakland women must necessarily
be scattered, which means wasted energy. If
the town could be divided Into districts and
an improvement club formed In esch district
to co-operate with the main body It would
have a tendency to concentrate and localize
effort and make It more effective. The spirit
of competition, which is always "the life of
trad?," would then start a friendly rivalry
that could not help being beneficial. As it is,
out of the 200 or more women who are sup
posfd to be interested in the club, a mere
handful of tireless ones are struggling along
und=r the weight of political "graft" and the
leaden indifference of the people generaUy.
However, with that Indomitable woman. Mrs.
Sarah Borland, at its head, the Improvement
Club has started the ball rolling in the right
direction and when they have accomplished
the work they have begun Oakland may thank
Its women for ilean streets, children's play
grounds, shade trees, more parks and a general
beautifying of the city.
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Weilbye gave a whist
dinner Saturday evening that proved to be a
very delightful affair. The dinner that pre
cdrd the whist games was quite elaborate,
consisting of eight courses. The table was a
ropy "drcÃm" made real with graceful knots
and streamers of pink satin ribbon and clus
ters of exquisite carnations.
The whist prize* were won by Mrs. Henry
Bull and Asa Mendenhall.
Among the Wellbyes' guests were Mr. and
Mrs. W. A. Schrock. Mr. and Mrs. A. V. Men

NO HEADGEAR
FOR "CO-EDS"
Associated Women Students
at University Take Radi
cal Action Regarding Hats
WORK OF MBS. CHENEY
Suggestion From Secretary
Bears Fruit in the
Form of Girls' Decision
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Jan. 24.
| The "co-eds" have declared against
I hats, in class room or on campus, and
J the edict for their removal has been
! prepared. It will be issued at once,
J and when the order has been promul
gated, girls of the University who con
-1 tinue to cover up their "crowning
! glory" with toque, bonnet, or what the
| irreverent term a "lid," of any descrip
j tion, are to be anathema in the ranks
i of the women students.
| The Associated Women Students of
! the university decided upon this action
iat a regular' meeting held on the
j campus to-day. They had been told by
i Mrs. May Cheney, appointment secre-
I tary of the university, who made a trip
j East last term and while away visited
| many Eastern universities, that girl
students in the East are dispensing
] with hats, both in class room and on
college campus. The desirability of
following the example of the Eastern
"co-ed" was pointed out by Mrs.
Cheney, whose influence apparently is
potent to accomplish reforms, and the
action of the associated students to
day followed.
The portion of the edict relating to
the wearing of hats on the campus will
not be enforced until' the weather has
moderated, and the storms no longer
threaten the bay district. In all class
rooms, however, the millinery that has
so often been the subject of objurga
tory remarks by men students will be
laid away, and the girls will appear
with tresses revealed to all.
The senior women last term decided
to wear "mortarboards" on the days
of university meetings, and the new
regulation is not expected to affect
them in their peculiar privilege of ap
pearing in the ancient form of uni
versity headgear on the days in ques
tion.

LAND COMPANY'S OFFICER
ARRESTED ON GRAVE CHARGE
O. W. Schwitzer, secretary of the
Pine Valley Land and Cattle Company,
a Nevada corporation with "offices in
the Parrott building, was arrested last
night and charged with obtaining
money under false pretenses. An Ital
ian named Canese Giovombotto makes
the complaint and alleges that Schwitz
er received $50 from him on the un
derstanding that he should secure him
a job with the company.
According to the officers of the cor
. poration, of which Jesse Orwin is pres
j ident and J. Emmett Walsh attorney,
i Schwifzer has been using his office for
J his own purposes and pocketing his ill
i gotten gains. The first intimation the
j company had of the charge against
j Schwitzer was after he had been taken
â  into custody. The concern authorized
I the secretary to advertise the sale of
j stock, but the official is alleged to have
1 informed would-be purchasers when
I they called, at the office that, in con-
I sideration of a certain amount, they
i would receive a steady position. The
| corporation owns several thousand
! acres of land in Nevada, also several
I thousand head of cattle.

SEEK WOMEN'S RELEASE ON
WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS
Alleges That Ordinance Under Which
Arrests Are Made Is Unconstitu
tional and Bail Is Excessive..
Seventy-nine of the women arrested
at 620 Jackson street and 1129 Du
pont street during the raid by mem
bers of the Grand Jury and deputy
sheriffs on Thursday night were sur
rendered yesterday morning. Appli
cations for writs of habeas corpus
were made before Judge Cook for the
release of the women and the Judge
made the writs returnable forthwith.
About the noon hour the women
were taken from the City Prison to
Judge Cook's court, where Attorney
Henry Ach, who represented them, ar
gued that the ordinance under which
they were arrested was unconstitu
tional. He also said that they had
been held on unreasonable bail by
Police Judge Fritz, $200 for being an
inmate of a house of ill fame and $100
for being a visitor. He asked that the
bail on the writ be fixed at the usual
amount, $20 or $10.
The Judge said it was a question
vith him as to whether the ordinance
was valid. It was, he thought, a sim
ilar case to one he had before him
two or three years ago. He reduced
the bail to $20 cash in each case, and
continued the argument till this aft
ernoon.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1005.
BITTER FIGHT
OVER ESTATE
Children by Different Wives
at War for Property of
Late J. Alexander Yoell
The contest to break the will of J<
Alexander Yoell, the Santa Clara pio
neer who died on July 15, 1904, is on in
Judge Kerrigan's court. A jury was
impaneled yesterday to try what prom
ises to be a long and bitter fight. On
one si3e are children of Yoell's first
wife, who, by terms of the will, re
ceived the greater'part of the estate;
on the other are children by a second
wife, who feel taat they have been un
duly slighted.
The contestants are Gertrude Ellen
Yoell, Beatrice Ellen Yoell and Emily
F. Dunn. By the terms of the pioneer's
will they are to receive $5000 apiece.
To the executrix of the will, Mrs. Eva
line Amelia Levy, and her sisters, Mrs.
Nettie Caroline Theobald and Miste
Alice Virginia Yoell, all children of
the first wife, are left the largest por
tions of the estate.
The will is contested on the ground
that the testator was not of sound
mind when the will was drawn up; also
that he "possessed certain impressions
with reference to some of his children
which were not founded on fact." Many
lawyers are Involved. On the side of
the proponents are D. M. Dei mas, H.
C. McPlke and Carl Westerfleld. The
contestants are represented by Bishop,
Wheeler & HoefÃw and ex-Judge
Slack.
The estate is now valued at about
$250,000. Jost before he separated from
his second wife, with whom he had
lived forty years, Yoell deeded half his
property to her. The remainder, over
which the contest is being waged, con
sists of property in this city valued at
about $160,000; San Jose property val
ued at $5000, and personal property val
ued at over $35,000. Various Catholic
charitable institutions receive small
legacies under the will.
Sensational developments are prom
ised, as it is alleged that Yoell once
thought his daughter Beatrice was in
a plot to poison him and that he was
suspicious of the children of his second
wife. The case will open at 10:30 this
morning.

BUCKBEE SAYS
BILL IS EVIL
Legislative Measure Causes
Talk Among the Brokers
Wlio Deal in Eeal Estate
Spencer C. Buckbee declares that a
bill introduced by Senator Hahn in
the California Legislature, January 9.
and entitled "An act to amend section
1C24 of the Civil Code, providing what
contracts must be is sure, if
enacted into ,law, to create a great
deal of friction and many lawsuits,
growing out of deals in real estate.
Mr. Buckbee says also that reputable
dealers in real estate in this city share
in his view of the matter. "It is per
haps a harsh term to use," he said
yesterday, "but the proposed law could
be used to promote blackmail."
Section 6 of the bill contains the
provisions which the real estate men
of San Francisco are eagerly discuss
ing. That section, which would re
quire brokerage contracts to be in
writing, is as follows:
An agreement authorizing or employing an
agent or broker to purchase or sell real estate
for compensation or a commission, provided
that if, under an oral agreement or authority
with such agent or broker by the owner of
real property, or his or her agent duly author
ized in writing to make such agreement or
grant such authorization, a sale or purchase
of real estate has been actually male by or
through such agent and the title to sucn real
property has been transferred, such oral agree
ment or authority shall be valid and may be
established by parole testimony; provided that
the grantor or grantee shall be liable for but
one commission or compensation; and provided
further that such agent or broker claiming a
compensation or commission, under oral agree
ment, shall bring suit for the collection cf
such commission or compensation within sixty
days after the recording of the transfer evi
dencing such purchase or sale and shall file
a written undertaking, executed by twi or
more gufflclent sureties, approved by the Judga
of the court in which said suit shall De
brought, to the effect that If the defendant
recovers Judgment the plaintiff will pay de
fendant's counsel fee to an amount not ex
ceeding one hundred dollars and all court
costs that may be sustained by the defendant
in such suit, the exact amount to be fixed by
the court.
Practically the same bill was passed
by both houses of the Legislature two
years ago but it was vetoed by the
Governor.

REPORT CAUSES
HEATED DEBATE
Supervisors Engage in Word
War Over an Order Rela
tive to Street Sweeping
Â«
The Board of Supervisors held a
rather heated session yesterday when
it took up consideration of the re
port of the Street Committee directing
the Auditor to audit bills for the
sweeping of streets only to such an
amount as will leave a balance of
$53,750, or bne-fourth of the total ap
propriation of $215,000 for the work
during April, May and June, when
the streets are in more urgent need
of cleaning. The committee reported
a deficit of more than $12,000 in the
fund, which will have to be made up
to enable the Auditor to set aside
$53,750 for the last three months of
this fiscal year. Boxton argued that
sufficient money had not been allowed
in the budget for cleaning streets and
the deficit was due to the fact that
the one-twelfth act was not complied
with according to prevailing custom.
"I do not see the use of presenting
such a report," said Boxton, "unless
it is intended to cast a blct on some
one. Other departments have exceed
ed the one-twelfth act in expenditures
of funds, yet nothing was said about
it."
In answer to Eggers' charge that
due economy had not been practiced,
Rea and Finn defended Board of
Works, saying that the cost of street
sweeping had increased owing to the
wages of laborers having been raised
from $2 25 to $2 50 per day.
Braunhart scored the Board of
Works for not complying with the
civil service provisions in the sweep
ing of streets. He added that bills al
ready incurred for $4000 had not yet
been presented to the board and asked
the Mayor to investigate the entire
matter, at the same time handing his
Honor a statement of the expenditures
and the condition of the fund.
"There were so many demands made
for funds by the various departments,"
said D'Ancona, "that the Finance
Committee was compelled to call a
halt. It would seem that at one time
the Police Department was the only
one to get what it wanted and it
looked as if Chief Wittman with his
Supervisor oh the Police Committee
had the Supervisors handcuffed."
Boxton, who is chairman of the
Police Committee, hotly resented this
allusion, which was meant for him,
saying: "If Supervisor D'Ancona wants
to mix it I will mix it with him and
hand it back with interest. He has
accused me of trickery and I deny it.**
D'Ancona disclaimed accusing Box
ton of trickery and also denied that
the compilation of the municipal bud
get had been effected with the as
sistance of down town merchants,
saying, however, that if such had been
the case the course could only be
commended.
Boxton afterward said he apologized
if he had said anything to hurt the
Finance Committee or any Supervisor
and the board thereupon referred the
reuart back to the Street Commiittee
for further inquiry as to the operations

ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO

PUBLICATION OFFICE* THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
TUESDAY JANUARY 24, 1905
THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION.
THE labor strike in St. Petersburg is less an industrial than a
political movement. Circumstances have long been leading up
to it. An autocracy, especially that of Russia, which is a case of
ofie family absorbing to itself all the increment of the empire, finally
makes itself impossible, and is destroyed. The present outbreak in
the Russian capital has many features in common with the French
revolution. For that, the French politicians and ecclesiastics had
been furnishing materials for three centuries. Men may endure re
pression through one generation or many, but finally there comes
a generation filled with the spirit of sacrifice, the willingness to
die for a reaction against repression, and then the tempest comes.
Richelieu, by repression, had a hand in the revolution that
waited until he had been dead a hundred and fifty-seven years. His
successor, Mazarin, was supplying the revolution with a reason when
he advised his pupil, Louis XIV, that the proper policy was always
to be false to national treaties, and implored the Prince to cultivate
' his natural gift of dissimulation. He was dead one hundred and
twenty-eight years before it came, but he had a part in it. The revo
cation of the Edict of Nantes, by driving out of France the arts and
crafts which were possessed almost entirely by the free-minded
Huguenots, supplied the element of human distress, through the de
cline of industries, and the storm broke with a roar, when that dis
tress had gnawed at three generations. The last one did not care
what happened to it. Nothing could make its condition worse and
it walked through the blood of a king to make it better. The
. church and the state in France held together against the people
until both were pitched into the gutter.
In Russia we have all of these familiar features. One family
. absorbs all of the resources of the empire, and pockets the proceeds
of all its industries. That family keeps up an army and navy, not
for national defense, but for family defense. The church stands by
the family that owns Russia. The church, as in the case wherever
education is not secular, keeps the people in ignorance and profits
on their besotted state. The Grand Dukes of the family which owns
Russia are the most dissolute, debauched, corrupt and pious wretches
seen in Europe since the court of Louis XIV. The people have
â been taught to look upon them as members of the family that owns
; Russia, and therefore superior beings, who have a right to their
rank vices and nasty ways.
But now there is a change. This present disturbance may not
complete the reaction. But it is one of the symptoms of it. The
ignorant and besotted people are led by Gopon, priest of the Greek
church, which comforts their superstitious souls. But the Holy
Synod immediately excomrruiicated Gopon, and set him in outer
darkness with Tolstoi. The Synod would like to let his followers
know that the holy ichor had been let out of Gopon's veins, for then
they would fear rather than trust him, but under the Synod's policy
the people are so ignorant they cannot read and there is no way of
letting them know that Gopon is no longer a priest. In this way
ignorance always reacts upon those who are responsible for it. The
Russian part of the army cannot be relied upon to shoot the people,
and there are not Cossacks enough within reach to make effective re
sistance, if the immense mob is enraged into showing its strength.
Russia has never had a real popular uprising. There have been
Polish insurrections and strife over succession to the throne, bat the
Russian people have never yet made an upheaving motion to get for
themselves larger life and liberty. The political reformers have de
pended upon murder to terrify the Government, and this method has
been without utility. The students have had occasional outbreaks
of resistance to the infamous restrictions and discipline of the
church in education, but the massacre of a few and exile of more
have sufficed to end such revolts. For this reason, if the present dis
order on the Neva result in a real uprising, an important and por
tentous assertion by the Russian people of their common interests
in the rights of man as enjoyed in other nations, it will furnish to
civists an interesting study and to history a novel chapter.
We have seen how other people revolutionize. Record is made
of the steps by which the English, French, Italians, Germans and
Spanish peoples went forward to representative government. They
all secured power in government, so that the actual people impress
themselves upon the system by which they are ruled. Russia and
Turkey are the only countries in Europe where the people are voice
less and powerless. A Russian revolution would be very interesting
to everybody except the family that owns the empire.
The incidents of Sunday and following seem to make any ac
commodation impossible. Force met with force must work out the
bloody problem. The dull Russian population is at last fired for
vengeance by the sight of its own blood. Men unarmed have beaten
generals of the army with bottles and have broken their swords. A
chapel full of holy ikons has been wrecked like a stable. Faith in
the Czar and the church has been shattered, and the whirlwind is
abroad.
THE ABUSE OF STREET ADVERTISING.
THE recent very vigorous action of Oakland's city fathers in the
matter of street signs and the reports of similar crusades against
unsightly billboards in the East makes timely the reading of an
article in the current Atlantic Monthly upon "The Ethics of the
Street." In this pfotest against the complete domination of our
cities' thoroughfares by the Ã¼biquitous advertisement of huge pro
portions and glaring invitation the writer, Marguerite Merington,
states the case against the evil very roundly and offers convincing
testimony to the effect which this public malady has upon city
dwellers.
To this writer the presence of flaunting panegyrics upon the
merits of certain whiskies, the delights of cheap smokes and the bliss
ful pleasures that must come from the wearing of certain perfected
garments, offered to the public at a philanthropic reduction, not only
blunts the artistic sense of every individual but has a positive demor
alizing effect upon each and every one of us. The psychology of
street signs seems to her to be readily solved in terms of definite hurt
to urban residents. What can be the result of constant reminders :
that such and such a thing relieves "that tired feeling" after a night
of straying in pastures ambrosial; what the effect of a ceaseless
dinning upon our conscience of the perils lurking at our elbow from
hideous diseases that yield only to the treatment of a certain quack
nostrum? A sordidness of feeling and a dulled instinct for the best
life are the least of the resultant evils.
"How vital an impression does it produce upon a girl," says
this voice of protest, "to tell her that tight lacing is injurious when

covers the walls of his playground with dazzling invitations to smoke

consequences will be pleasantly averted by the action of a candy
bolus while he sleeps?" Not only are the adults, then, open to the
deleterious influences of riotous advertising, but the rising generation
feels at once its malign power.

THE GIFT OF HER DAUGHTER
c Â£ I SUSPECT that she will cause
I me to end my days in a mad-
I house."
â  Mrs. Pemberton's words were
tragedy itself, but her voice
was calm, even colorless, and her
he~d rested comfortably against the
back of a scarlet cushioned easy
chair. Knowing Mrs. Pemberton, I
gauged the circumstances b" her po
sition rather than her manner of.
speech.
"What is Florence's latest?" I
queried, sitting down on the top step
and gizing up admiringly at Flor
ence's youthful mother.
Mrs. Pemberton glanced at me fur
tively. "Do you love the child?" she
suddenly asked.
"Sure," I answered laconically,
musing the while on the harmony be
tween delicate coloring and soft
, brown hair.
"Then why don't you marry her?"
I looked inquiringly at my inter
locutor. Her coloring was quite vivid,
after all.
"You do me honor," I said dryly,
"but I fear I'm too old for kindergar
ten work."
Mrs. Pemberton sighed. "She is 17
to-day. I was only a year older
{ when she was born."
I made a swift mental calculation.
! "Of course I cannot coerce any one
into marrying the chUdâl couldn't
' even mention it to any one but a tried
! friend like youâbut I somehow fan
, cied that you were fond of her. I
do think that marriage might take
these thousand and one foolish fan
cies out of her head."
"You haven't told me yet whatâ"
"I'm coming to it. As I said, to
day is her birthday. A year ago I
promised her a string of pearls for
her next gift. This morning I asked
her what she wished, thinking, of
course, that she would answer, 'that
beautiful string of pearls, mamma.'
; Any other girl would, but not she!"
Mrs. Pemberton made a dramatic
pause.
"Well?" I ventured, shifting my po
sition a little that I might the better
observe a pair of handsome eyes.
" 'Of all things in the world, dear
mamma, I do want a planchette!' "
I chuckled. Mrs. Pemberton frowned
entrancingly at me.
"Now, don't pretend that you know
what a planchette is," she reproved,
"for I don't believe you do. I didn't,
but you may be sure I didn't let my
daughter know the Ignorance of her
mother. I told her to choose one her
self, and send the bill to me."
"Bravo!" I exclaimed. "And then?"
"As soon as she was gone, I ran to
the dictionary, Just as you would have
done." Her remark was pointed.

INA WEIGHT HANSON
"What is a planchette?" I asked
diplomatically. I even hesitated a lit
tle over the pronunciation.
Mrs. Pemberton leaned over and pat
ed my shoulder.
"Honest little boy," she commended.
Then she settled her cushions again,
closed her beautiful eyes and recited:
" 'A small board fitted with a pencil
and two casters, made to move easily
over a sheet of paper when hands rest

lightly upon it; once believed by some
to write independently of the volition
of the person or persons touching it,
but generally explained by the domi
nant idea.' "
"Ye gods! The memory of her!" I
exclaimed.
Mrs. Pemberton regarded me com
placently.
"Then, of course, I turned to dom
inant idea. It means 'an idea fixed in
the mind of Its subject by the power
of habit or otherwise â' "
"Stay!" I interrupted hastily. "Is
that the little beast In there on the
table?"
Mrs. Pemberton turned her shapely
head in the direction of my pointing
finger.
"It Is," she affirmed.
ALL SWAMPS.
HixâHow did you buy your place
In Lonlyville? By the foot or acre?
DlxâNeither. By the quart.
"Let's see if we can make it write,"
I wheedled, springing up and looking
down into her brown eyes. Dear heart!
Did she think I wanted Florence?
"I verily believe you would abet the
child in her folly," she murmured, but
she rose quickly and went into the
parlor.
"First, a piece of paper," I said gayly.
I found several leaves on the window
seat. I put one under the planchette,
and we seated ourselves at the table.
Mrs. Pemberton laid one small hand on
the heart-shaped board, and I put my
hand on her hand.
"That's not the way," she said
hastily.
"It's the latest improved," I declared!
boldly. "I know more about these little â¢
'animals than you think."
Now 1 was certainly possessed of a j
dominant idea, and I was very much i
excited in finding out whether the plan- j
chette would apprise Mrs. Pemberton I
of it. So excited, in fact, that I de-!
liriously passed my free arm around
her pretty shoulders, and laid my face I
against hers. We both closed our eyes.
She moved ever so slightly.
"Sh!" I warned. "It's writing!"
Sure enough it was moving spooklly
over the paper. We held our breaths. i
Finally it gave two small Jerks and
stopped. Mrs. Pemberton threw off my
arm and sat up ungracefully straight.
I took out the paper and read:
" T am sure dear mamma loves Mr.
Paul, and heâ' "
"Nonsense!" cried my lady.
"See for yourself," I pretested,
handing her the paper. "It is not your
writing, and it is not mine. Some
thing uncanny about it, isn't there?
It ought to be true, dear," I went on,
as she studied the writing, "for Mr.
Paul loves dear mamma with all of
his unworthy heart. I don't want to
be Florence's hubsand, sweetheart; I
want to be her father."
The paper slipped from her hands.
She turned toward me, her lustrous
eyes tearful. I took her in my arms,
and was bending my head, when we
heard a voice singing in the hall.
Mrs. Pemberton ran to the piano, and
I sat down on the sofa.
"Hello, folks," greeted Florence
cheerfully, running into the room.
"Please don't detain me. I just came
for my letter. I want to get it out on
this mail. Why, where's the rest
of it?"
Mrs. Pemberton's nervous fingers
were Jerking out the chord of D. I sat
speechless. Presently Florence's sharp
eyes spied the missing sheet. She
picked it ud. She looked from her
mother to me and laughed.
"I wouldn't try the planchette with
out sharpening the pencil," she sug
gested mockingly. "It won't work
without graphite."
She ran out and I went over to the
piano.
"It did work, didn't it, best be
loved?" I whispered, resuming where
Florence's entrance had Interrupted.

Bakery Union Asks Removal
of Boycott Case to Some
Other Court for Hearing
â RELATIVES IN BUSINESS
â¦
Affidavit Alleges That the
. Judge Gave Advice to
V. the Enemies of Labor
. The relationship of Superior Judge
J. C. B. Hebbard to persons interested
,in the bakery business is made the
grounds for a motion to remove pending
boycott proceedings from his court to
that of some other Judge for trial. A
notice of the motion, to be made next
â  Friday, was filed yesterday by Attor
ney R. P. Troy, acting for the defend
. ants, in the suit of Thorp & Co.
against the unions of Bakery and
Confectionery Workers, Pie Bakers
â  and Salesmen of Bakery Goods, for
an injunction to restrain the defend
ant* from committing acts injurious
to the plaintiff's business.
Accompanying the notice is an affi
davit of Paul Graves, one of the de
fendants. He charges that Judge
Hebbard's wife, brother-in-law and
father-in-law, the latter now dead,
jwere for many years Interested in bak
eries, and that as a matter of friend
ship and feeling for the interests of his
. relatives the Judge has advised them
how to combat the unions named. On
this account, says Graves, the Judge
is biased and the defendants cannot
have a fair trial in his court.
The affiant recites at length his
idea of the purpose of unions to bet
ter the material condition and elevate
the .moral tone of the workingman.
He quotes certain strong paragraphs
from Judge Hebbard's opinion in the
Goldberg-Bowen suit against the Sta
. blemen's Union. One of the phrases,
it is claimed, Justifies violence on the
. part of a person boycotted and ex
presses the opinion that such would
â¢meet with the approval of a Jury un
der the right of self-defense.
â¢ -It is further alleged by Graves that
Judge Hebbard recently remarked,
. "I intend to stand for another shot
tb-morrow if the unions do not like
my views." It is charged, too. that he
has expressed himself as antagonistic
to labor unions generally and to all
. connected with them.

â of acute gastritis at the San Francisco

superintendent of the place, says the
authorities have done all In their

proves fatal.
The parents of all the unfortunate
little ones are not known to the au

Mrs. Boggs' Promise to Di
vide Estate to Avoid Con
test Must Be Fulfilled
Judge Hebbard, in a written opinion
denying defendants' motion for Judg
ment on the pleadings, disposed yester
day of the important phases of the suit /
of Mildred Wellendorff and others
against Mac H. B. Boggs and others.
W. L. Smith, owner of landed and
other Interests in Siskiyou and Shasta
counties, died in May, 1902. His will,
executed ten years before, made Mrs.
Boggs, a niece, the sole legatee, al
though he then had two sisters living.
Five nephews and nieces, heirs at law,
considered that they had good grounds
for contest and, it was alleged, to in
duce them to refrain from opposing the
will, Mrs. Boggs drew a written agree
ment to give each of the five a one
tenth interest in the estate.
This agreement was signed by all the
parties excepting W. A. Bacon, one of
the nephews. Mrs. Boggs neglected to
obtain his signature but proceeded to
get a distribution of the estate to her
self. Since then she has declined to
divide with her relatives. Mildred Wel
lendorff, now dead, Andrew J. Bacon
and lone Spencer sued for their shares
under the agreement. Mrs. Boggs
pleaded the statute of frauds, saying!
that the nephews an ' nieces knew Of i
the existence of the two sisters, who, as ]
heirs at law, would each be entitled
to a fourth of the estate, leaving only i
one-twentieth for each of the remain- j
ing nephews and nieces; and that in ;
view of the knowledge their agreement j
was a conspiracy to withhold testimony
and defraud the sisters, who, living
outside the State, were not acquainted
with California laws.
Judge Hebbard holds that the plain
tiffs performed their part of the con
tract by not contesting the will and
the statute of frauds cannot be pleaded
against them. He also says that the
decree of distribution is not conclusive
M to contests between the heirs and the
assignees and the performance by the
plaintiffs of their part of the contract j
prevents Mrs. Boggs from retaining
either the personal or real property of j
the estate. The court also granted a
motion to compel Mrs. Boggs to answer
certain questions on deposition.

of Hoch.
â¦
New Tale ol Poisoning Told
Concerning Death ol
One Spouse.
Three Others Known to Have Lived
but Short Time After His
Marriage to 1 hem
* Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 23.â "1 am being
poisoned."
One of the many wives of Johann
Hoch -is alleged to have made this
statement on her deathbed. The in
formation was furnished Inspector
Shippy to-day by Mrs. William Stein
brecher, the daughter-in-law of Mrs.
Mary Steinbrecher-Hoch. She furnished
the police with considerable informa
tion in the Hoch case and also identi
fied a photograph which was found to
day in the rogues' gallery, together
with evidence that the now much
wanted man had served one year in
jail and one year in the Bridewell for
disposing of mortgaged property.
"My mother-in-law married Hoch in
August, 1894, and two months later she
died mysteriously after one short
week's sickness," said Mrs. Stein
brecher. "The day before she died she
told me that she was being poisoned.
Shortly after her marriage my mother
in-law made Hoch her sole heir and
he got all her property, amounting to
about $3000. Nothing was ever done
about investigating her death as the
physicians Issued .a certificate to the
effect that her death was due to nat
ural causes."
Inspector Shippy was flooded with
information concerning the alleged
marrying and swindling mania of Hoch
to-day and in speaking of the case he
said:
"I now know of twelve living wives
of this man and at least four who
have died. I have enough evidence
against him to send him to the pen
itentiary for the balance of his life.
I also have information of three or
four suspicious deaths.
"From one of the women to whom
I have talked," he continued, "I have
learned that Hoch was once a drug
gist, and it is my opinion he employed
some chemical process or slow poison
ing in his work, such as might puzzle
the most expert physician. From the
stomach or intestines of Mrs. Hoch,
his latest victim, whose body was ex
humed at Oakwoods on Saturday, there
may still develop evidence of poison."

BRIBERY FUND
IN PORTLAND
Liquor Dealers Kaise Money
With Which to Purchase
the Legislature of Oregon
c
Special Dispatch to The Catt.
PORTLAND, Jan. 23âPersistent ru
mors that the Liquor Dealers* Associa
tion has used money to bribe the Ore
gon Legislature to amend the local
option law passed at the last session
so aa to make it nugatory have led
to the introduction of a resolution by
Senator Haines calling for a committee
to investigate. The resolution recites
that it was a matter of comment prior
to the convening of the Legislature
that money would be used by the
liquor interests to secure the revision
or repeal of the local option law and
further that these rumors have since
assumed the definite form that a brib
ery fund has been raised. The Senator
declares this will cast a taint on the
Legislature and asks for the appoint
ment of a committee of five to investi
gate and report.

FORTIFICATIONS
BILL PASSED
Teller' Takes Occasion to
Object to New Agreement
Made With Santo Domingo
USURPATION OF POWER
Unsuccessful Attempt Made
by Beveridge to Set Date
for a Vote on Statehood
â¦
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.âBeveridge
made another ineffectual effort in the
Senate to-day to have a time fixed for
voting on the statehood bill. The op
posing Senators expressed an unwill
ingness to vote on the bill until the
amendments shall have been disposed
of and Beveridge would not consent to
a vote on them without an agreement
extending to the bill itself.
The fortifications appropriations bill
was passed, after the rejection of the
amendment striking out the provision
for insular fortifications.
When the Senate met to-day Perkins
of California presented the credentials
of Frank P. Flint. The credentials of
Lodge of Massachusetts, Winthrop
Murray Crane of Massachusetts and
McCumber of North Dakota were also
presented.
Teller criticized the apparent lack of
Bystem in fortifying the insular posses
sions. He was not in favor of any
great expenditure on the islands, with
the future policy in view of the ulti
mate turning of them over to their in
habitants.
Teller said he had noticed in the
morning papers that we were about to
take another island, "that we are guar
anteeing the stability of the Island of
Santo Domingo."
"It is a great job," he added; "it
means an army in' Santo Domingo." j
"I deny," he continued, "the author- !
ity of the executive department to
make any agreement to bind the people j
of the United States in the way mdi- ;
cated. It is an assumption of author
ity on the part of the executive."
Perkins of California replied briefly
to Teller as to his remarks relating to
the Philippines. The islands were
United States territory and the im
provement provided was necessary, he
said.
Money expressed the opinion that the
Japanese were the natural protectors
of the Filipinos if they need a protec
tor, which he did not believe to be the
case.
Teller's amendment to strike out the
provisions for insular fortifications was
voted down, 17 to 38, a party vote. The
bill was then passed.
Beveridge made an effort to secure an
agreement to vote on the statehood
bill, but opposing Senators objected.
"It is contrary to precedent to fix a
date to vote on statehood bills," sug
gested Carmack, referring to the oppo
sition to the omnibus statehood bill of
last session, which was led by Bev
eridge. The thrust Ifareated a general
smile at Beveridge's expense, in which
he joined.
At 6 o'clock the Senate went into
executive session and five minutes later
adjourned.
STEAMSHIP SAILS THROUGH
LAYERS OF PUMICE STONE
Thick Coating Found on the See in
the Vicinity of the Benin
Islands.
HONOLULU, Jan. 17.â0n her way
over from Manila the big freighter
Texan had an experience that kept
her officers anxious for several hours.
When near the Benin Islands the
steamship ran into thick layers of
pumice stone, which had evidently
just been emitted, by some volcano.
It kept getting thicker and thicker
until there were finally patches of
It as much as 600 feet long. So thick
was the field of pumice that it was
impossible to see water for several
hours.
Captain Morrison was unable to
see any volcano on the islands, but
believes that one was in eruption In
that locality. However, it may be
that the seismic outburst may have
occurred under the sea, the pumice,
which is very light, rising to the sur
face.

CRACK COLT SALABLE SHOWS HIS HEELS TO PELHAM
FOUR FAVORITES BEATEN AT OAKLAND.
EDRODUN DOWNS THE REPROBATE
Hainault Finishes in Front of Poorly Ridden First CMce, Arcade
Instrument at Long
Odds Proves a
Surprise.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
Charley Henshall's crack colt Pel
ham finished second to Salable in the
concluding event at Oakland yester
day and it was the severest blow the
talent received during - a somewhat
tempestuous session. For if there was
one spot where it looked as if a spec
ulator could back up the cart and un
load the Henshall entry seemed to fur
nish the Opportunity. At 4 to 5 the
bookmakers did a land office business
in pasteboards. At the start of the
race, which was decided over the Fu
turity course, Pelham and Squire John
son bumped together and this must
â¢ have rattled Sam Greenfield, rider of
the favorite. He picked the worst go
â¢ing possible for Pelham thereafter and
at the wire proved easy game for 'Big
Bill" Knapp. who piloted the third
choice, Salable, in clever fashion. Mc-
Bride with Squire Johnson lost the
show to True Wing.
Favorites fared none too well from
the start, Haven Run and Esherin be
ing the only ones to land. None of the
winners were neglected entirely at that.
The attendance was large.
â¢ W. Davis rode Sol LAchtenstein, the
13 to 10 favorite for the introductory
sprint at six furlongs, and was beaten
by Instrument, an 8 to 1 choice. Davis'
mount got caught in a jam on the back
stretch, losing at least three lengths.
This gave McÃride on Instrument an
opportunity to steal a lead, and while
Sol closed strong he was downed more
than a length. Sam Greenfield finished
third with Lady Kent.
. After two runaway wins. The Repro
bate received a setback in the five and
a half furlong selling dash. He
closed a pronounced choice over David
Â°Boland, and after racing out in front
with that fast sprinter, lost to the
10 to 1 shot Edrodun at the wire by
more than a length. Jakie Jones
piloted the winner, and got his mount
away in front. Edrodun was outfooted
one part of the trip, then caught the
leaders all in, down where the money
is. David Boland easily disposed of
San Jose for the show.
Willie Harris" Haven Run, a 9 to 5
favorite, took the seven furlong num
ber, for which a field of eight started.
Yellowstone gave the first choice an
argument for two-thirds of the dis
tance, then faded away. Dotterel came
fast at the end, downing The Fretter
three lengths for the place. Brennus
and Dr. Sherman met with poor luck,
tutting no figure in the race.
Willie Daly was responsible for the
defeat of Arcade, which was backed
down from twos to 13 to 10 favoritism
in the betting on the mile and fifty
yard selling number. Willie had his
â¢father's horse in the poor going part of
the way. and in the stretch rode a zig
. zag finish. Hainault with Chandler up
and the pacemaker throughout, was
then enabled to lead the first choice
out half a length. Langford James, an
#7 pounder and 50 to L, ran into the
show. Sam Greenfield got away poorly
with North West, a well supported one,
and then only lost third place by a
head.
Two races keyed Johnny Schorr's
Esherin right up to concert pitch, for
the mare made a gallop of the mile
and seventy yard selling fixture. The
price receded in the betting from" 3% to
4\i, and Bonner had her out in the
lead from start to finish. Minder on
Jack Little, a 10 to 1 chance, landed
second, five lengths ahead of Maxtress,
Achilles and Mr. Dingle ruled about
equal choices with the winner.
TRACK NOTES.
Dick Dwyer dispatched the fields
yesterday and little fault could be
found with his work, which was first
class.
Edrodun, winner of the second race,
was bid up from $500 to $900 by L.

AUDITOR WANTS
NAME CLEARED
John J. Herr Declares That
Injustice Has Been Done
Him by College Begents
John J. Herr, the former auditor of
the board of regents of the State Uni
versity, who was removed from that
office shortly after the McKowen scan
dal, is anxious to clear himself of any
stigma that the removal might Imply.
He declares in a straightforward man
ner that he knew nothing of Mc-
Kowen's peculations until the matter
was brought to his notice in the news
papers. Following are extracts from
Herr's open letter to Governor Pardee:
Hon. Georgia C. Pardee. President of the
Board of Regents of the University of Califor
niaâSir: As a matter of simple Justice. I re
spectfully ask your attention to the following
statement of facts:
Because of the stealings of McKowen. I have
been removed from the position which I have
held for fifteen years as auditor of the Board
of Regents of the University of California. By
this act I have been branded before the public
as. In some degree, responsible for the embez
zlement of public funds. As a natural conse
quence, I have suffered In reputation. In busi
ness, and in peace of mind.
If I am guilty of wrong doing I ought to suf
fer and to be punished, but if not, then I ought
to be relieved of the stigma placed upon me by
summary removal from a position which I held
for many years.
With the utmost emphasis. I beg to tell you
that I was In no wise responsible for the loss
which the State has sustained through the
crimes of McKjwen. The money which he ap
propriated to his own uses was money of which
no account ever appeared in the books which I
audited. I had no means of knowing that the
money had been paid to him for the benefit of
the university. As a matter of fact, I did not
know it. It Is the business of an auditor to
certify to the correctness of accounts submitted
to him. This I did promptly, accurately, con
scientiously. More than this it was not in my
power to do.
Some one was unquestionably responsible fcr
the loose methods which McKowen was permit
ted to employ in collecting and handling the
money of the university, and some one besides
himself may rightfully be blamed for the se
ver? loss entailed as a result. Who Is to
blame?
I am entirely blameless in this matter. I
performed my duties to the Board of Regents
for fifteen years and did It so honorably that no
stain nor shadow of a stain can Justly be at
tached to my name. I care nothing for the of
fice I held and the salary I received, but I care
everything for my reputation and my standing
In the community. I feel that I have been
made the innocent victim of a great wrong.
No man who has given a fair hearing to my
side of the case (and there are many, Includ
ing some of the most prominent citizens who
have done so) hesitates to acquit me of all re
sponsibility in this affair. Business men know
that stealing of this kind cannot be prevented
by an auditor, particularly when he cannot
make his examinations except at long periods,
the books and accounts submitted to him show
ing no evidence of wrong.
I am ready to meet at any time, in any
presence,. those who have defamed and sought
to degrade me in the estimation of the public.
And I will never rest content until the good
name I have built up through years of business
life in California, and which I have always

LITTLE BOXERS
PREPARING FOR
A HARD BATTLE
Sports Interested in
Neil - Hyland
Conflict ,
Frankie Neil, the little bantam, is
spending a strenuous life at Billy Shan
non's road house, near San Rafael, to
condition himself for his coming battle
with Dick Hyland. The lad has been
working like a beaver for nearly two
weeks, and is gradually rounding Into
form under the watchful eye of Frank*
McDonald.
Frankie works with Young Corbett,
and the pair have a mery time. The
daily three-round bouts are fast and
furious and Trainer McDonald has to
frequently caution them about hitting
hard. Frankie generally smiles, and
says: "I didn't hit you hard, aid- I,
Bill." Biff, a stiff one is struck, and
then both are at it. Nell realizes Hy
l%nd is a tough customer and is not
taking any chances of not being right
on the night of the bout. He now
weighs about 117V4 pounds. The many
spectators who have seen him work,
proclaim him faster than Hyland. As
Dick has never gone twenty rounds,
the public do not know his real quali
ties.
Yesterday morning Frankie, Corbett
and McDonald went ten miles over the
hills and al! returned perspiring freely.
In the afternoon the little fellow
donned his gym suit and spent more
than an hour punching the bag, skip
ping the rope, shadow fighting and
weight pulling. A wrestling match
with Jimmie Rothwell completed the
day's work.
Last night the boys of the camp, ac
companied by Billy Shannon, occupied
a box at the vaudeville show that visits
San Rafael every Monday evening.
Hyland's admirers are beginning to
increase daily, for the good fqfim dis
played by the amateur at his training
quarters is beginning to be buzzed
along the line and each day is the oc
casion of a pilgrimage to Sheehan's
tavern. If Hyland could only develop
some speed on his feet he would have
ten times as many who think well of
him.
Nothing seems to tire the lad. He
works all day long and seems ready for
more when it is over. Boxers of every
size and every style are brought forth
and Dick goes down the line each time.
He is a willing worker surely, but not
one who Impresses or electrifies the
spectator. He Is of the Battling Nel
son order, content to go right ahead
and gradually work himself into form.
Big Jack McCormack felt the force
of one of the youngster's wallops in
the body the other day and he swears
It was the hardest he ever took. Dick
managed to bring in one of those jolty
lefts, and when it landed McCormack
did not feel at All happy. He thinks
Hyland the best small fighter he ever
saw as a beginner.
Dick weighs 123 pounds at the pres
ent time, so the question of weight will
not bother him in the least. He has
never done ringside weight before in
his life and his manager, Sammy Mc-
Clintic, is a bit worried. But the worry
Is not shared by the little fighter. He
has not commenced to diet himself yet
and as long as he can keep his weight
down with his present fare, he feels
that it will be easy to take off as much
as he wants when he cuts the liquids
out.
A few bets have already been made
with Nell on the long end at 2 to L
This price will probably prevail when
the betting opens up within a few
days, but the odds will surely drop to
10 to 4, and perhaps 10 to 3 before the
boys enter the ring. It is expected
that there will be lots of Nell money
floating around when the wagering
starts.

PORTLAND TEAM
LOOKS STRONG
Manager McCreedie Collect
ing Some Stars and the
Outlook Is Very Bright
c
PORTLAND, Jan. 23.âManager Mc-
Creedie of the Portland baseball team
by judicious exchanges of signed men
has acquired a crack Infleld for next
season and Is now at work securing
outfielders. His team will have no
weak points when he has finished,
though his system is costing him
money.
In the cases of Atz and Schlafley he
had to give two players for each of
them, but from the records of both men
secured and the fact that they All
positions that are of the utmost Im
portance to the club, Portland has not
got any the worst of the bargain.
New Orleans gets Beck and Nadeau
for Ata, which looks to some local fans
as though the Southerners were getting
the best of the deal, but a good short
stop had to be secured and as the
Southern manager held out for the two
men the local manager closed the deal.
In the case of Schlafley Portland had
to part with probably the best pitcher
on the team, Ham Iberg, and in addi
tion McCreedie gave Lohman young
Jim Kelty, who is practically an un
known quantity, but In securing a man
of Schlafley's ability the locals have
not made such a bad bargain. The
catchers will be Maurice Steelman and
Dick Boettger and the pitchers Jake
Thielman, Ike Butler, Bert Jones
Jimmy St. Vram and W. Essick.

MANHOOD
FOR MEN WHO HAVE LOST IT
$1000 REWARD TO WEAK MEN.
Let any man who is weak, broken down, old and decrepit in physical weak
ness, full of pains and aches, gloomy, despondent and cheerless âany man
who wants to be stronger and younger than he feelsâlet him come and tell
me how he feels and if I say that I can cure him I will forfeit $1000 if I fail.
X don't want money that Z don't earn. Z don t nted it, and am not after
it. But I am after the dollars that are now going wrong in the quest of
health. Look at all these poor wrecks of humanity that are spending all
they earn on drugsâdove that la paralysing their vital organsâthat have
spent all they have earned for years without gaining a pound of strength
for the hundreds of dollars wasted.
That is the money that I am after, because for every dollar I take 1 can
give a thousand per cent interest, and I don't want it at all until I have
cured you if you will secure me. I have cured so many cases right here
that I can prove my claims to you. but if that proof is not enough I'll give
you the-names of men right near youâwhere you are. Is that fair?
Most of the Belts that I am selling now are to men who have been sent
here by their friends' whom I have cured. I think that is the best evidence
that my business is a success from the standpoint of cures, as well as on
the dollar side.
Just lately I have received letters of praise from these men:
James P. Daniels. 709 Devisadero street. San Francisco He was cured
of a back trouble of 12 years' standing.
J. M. Gaskill. 220 ChestnuWavenue. Santa Cruz. Cal., who says I cured
him of Indigestion, Constipation, Nervousness and Lumbago, from which
he had suffered 15 years.
Wherever you are I think I can give you the name of a man in your
town that I have cured. Just send me your address and let me try. This
is my twenty-fourth year in the business of pumping new vim into worn
out humanity. - and I've got cures in nearly every town on the map.
Come and see me if you can and I'll nx you up; or. if you can't call,
write to me and I'll do the same. I've got a nice book on men that I'll send
sealed, free, if you Inclose this ad. /

bers will devote themselves entirely to
developing and protecting the salmon
and other figh in the streams of the
State. The club will hold outings at
scheduled times and the members will
start for the woods in one band to
pursue their favorite pastime.
The movement to start the organ
ization was inaugurated a few days
ago by E. J. Kaplan, Bert Spring. J.
Sammi, J. Swan and several other well
known anglers. Some few days ago,
notices were sent to various fishermen
jin the otty and when the meeting was
I called to order in the Pioneer building
! last night there were one hundred
and twenty-five men ready to become
members.
The following board of directors was
chosen: J. Swan, S. A. Wells, Clarence
Ashlin, Bert Spring. G. W. Wentworth,
j Rube Haas, W. A. Halsted and J.
I Fiynn.
The directors named the following
! officers to serve during the coming
J year: President, J. Swan; first vice
I president, S. A. Wells; second vice
j president, W. A. Halsted; secretary.

WITH MANY PASSENGERS ON BOARD.
Oceanic Company s Liner Has Big Cargo
George W. Elder Is
: to Un
derwriters.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Sonoma, Captain Herrlman, ar
rived yesterday from the Antipodes
and landed the Australian-British
mail, 453 bags of it, in time to make
schedule overland connections. The
Sonoma brought about 200 passengers
and a large cargo. Fine weather fa
vored the Mner throughout the pas
sage.
. Among the passengers from Hono
lulu was General Francis Moore, who
commands the department of Califor
nia. He has been inspecting the array
post at the Island port. Honolulu,
aays the general, is absolutely unpro
tected. In the event of war the Pacific
equa.dron would have to guard Uncle
Barn's mid-ocean territory, and in the
event of any vessels' sustaining In
jury San Francisco would be the
nearest port of refuge, as nothing has
been done to make Pearl Harbor of
any important naval value. The work
of fortifying the Islands is now being
laid out. How much of it is done,
pays General Moore, depends upon
What appropriation for the work is
knade by Congress.
The Sonoma's cargo included a large
shipment of flax. 1000 hides, 1968
Backs sulphate of ammonia, 1150 bales
Â©f wool, sheepskins, furs, pitch, ban

Will Take Place of Elder.
Hope of saving the steamer George W. El
der, which went ashore Saturday night near
Goble, on the Columbia River, Is said to be
slim. It Is understood that the Harrlman peo
ple will abandon the coaster to the under
writers. Water Is rising in the stranded ves
sel's hold. Most of the cargo hae been taken
from the wreck and conveyed to Portland.
The Pacific Mall Company's Panama liner
â¢ 'â eta Rica will take the Elder's place on the
Portland run. Captain Clem Randall of the
George W. Elder will he transferred to the
Costa Rica. George Monroe, formerly master
of the collier Leelanaw, was appointed to the
Coeta Rica yesterday as mate.
Too Rough to Make Landing.
The steam schooners Del Norte and Manda
lay were reported off Crescent City yesterday
waiting until the eea calmed down sufficiently
to allow them to approach the landing. It may
be several days before they are able to get
in. and It is possible at this time of year
that their coal supply may run short before the
sea calms down, and they may have to return
to this port.
The Overdue List.
The vessels on the overdue list were quoted
for reinsurance yesterday as follows: Stork,
SO per cent; Robert Rickmers. 85 per cent;
Loch Etive, 20 per cent; Neomi, Norge and
Lord Elgin, 15 per cent.
Optima Is Abandoned.
The German ship Optima, reported ashore
on the coast of Norfolk, has been abandoned.
The Optima, well-known at this port, -was
bound from Hamburg for Santa Rosalia.

DECLARE POWER
WAS USURPED
Supervisors Say the Board of
Works Erred in Granting
Permit for Curved Track
FIGHT ON SHOEING- BIDS
Joint Committee Unable to
Beach an Agreement on
Parceling Out of Awards
â, âÂ»
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution calling the Board
of Works to task for granting the ,
United Railroads a permit to lay a
curved track at Post and Kearny
streets. The resolution follows:
Whereas. The Board of Public Works of
the city and county of San Francisco is neither
a legislative nor a Judicial body, but purely
an executive one, deriving its powers from
and limited In its functions to the language
of the express grants made by the charter
of said city and county and by the ordinances
and resolutions of the Board of Supervisors,
the legislative body of said city and county; !
and
Whereas, The said Board of Public Works
did issue to the United Railroads of San
Francisco a permit to open streets to lay a
curved track at Post and Kearny streets for
the purpose of connecting their Post street
tracks with their Kearny street tracks, when
there Is apparently no express grant made in
the franchise of said company or its pre
decessors in interest to lay such a curved
track; now, therefore, be It
Resolved, That the Board of Public Works
be and It Is hereby notified that its action In
issuing said permit to the United Railroads
of San Francisco is entirely unwarranted and
without authority and said board is hereby
directed not to issue a permit of any kind or
to grant a privilege of any character what
ever, unless it is first authorized by law
clearly and explicitly so to do.
Supervisor Braunhart characterised '
the action of the Board of Works in ,
granting the permit as a usurpation j
|of the powers of the Supervisors. He
asked that the resolution be sent at ,
once to the board, holding that the
Mayor's signature to the resolution
' was not necessary, and it was so or
dered.
! The joint Supervisors' Committee
;on Police, Health and Electricity re
â¢timed consideration of the plan to â 
parcel out horseshoeing contracts to j
five members of the Master Horsesho
| ers' Association (but excluding "Ed
[ die" Qraney) at $2 50 per horse and
|to Ed Toy at $2 25 per horse. Super
! visor d'Ancona suggested that all the
I bids be rejected and new and separate
! bids be invited for each department,
\ instead of a blanket bid for the sev
eral departments and that the work
;be then parceled out to various bid
' ders.
Supervisor Finn objected to the re
: jection of the bids, saying that Ed
Toy was the lowest bidder at $2 25
, per horse and he should get the entire
I contract, as it would save the city :
â  about $400. Supervisor Rock referred
to the point raised that Toy had been
allowed to substitute a smaller check
after his bid was received, but it was
explained that this did not invalidate
the bid.
Supervisor Boxton objected to re
jecting the bids and argued that the
plan to award the contract to several
responsible bidders should be carried
, out or else the charter should be
obeyed and the contract given to the
j lowest bidder. Boxton also objected
to shutting out any bidder in the
awards.
i The motion to reject the bids was
I lost by a vote of 3 to 4.
The motion to allow the bidders to
' draw all but $100 of their certified
checks, which they had deposited,
was carried. Further consideration of
the matter was then postponed until
! next Monday at 1:30 p. m.
Schooner Fast in Mud.
The men in charge of the fog whistle at Lime
Point discerned a bay schooner, the Emily Mar
tin, at 0 o'clock last night caught in the strong
ebb tide and drifting toward the rocks. Dis
tress signals attrarted the attention of the Fort
I Point Life Saving Station and a boat was sent
| to tne rescue. It was found, however, that a
launch was necessa:y to tow the schooner to
safety and word was sent to Oowley's boat-
I house. The crew of three on the Emily Mar
' tin dropped three anchors in an endeavor to
] avert disaster. When the launch Recruit ar
rived a line was made fast and the work of
towing the schooner commenced. One of the
anchors became wedged in the rocky bottom
1 and after two hours of tugging the launch was
I compelled to leuve, as the captain of the Emily
â¢ Martin refused to slip the anchor chain. There
is little prospect that the schooner can get
i away before the change of tide this' morning,
1 and she Is lying in a perilous position.

BACK FROM
AUSTRALIA
Funmakers With Dutch
Jokes Find Thickheaded
Auditors in the Antipodes
MAUD AMBER MAROONED
She Will Return and Tell
of Harry James, Who Has
Troubles Over the Women
Travel stained and tired but still in
company formation and riding every
foot of the way home "The Travesty
Stars," the Kolb-Dill-Barnard-Amber-
Blake combination that left here May
6. 1904, to conquer Australia, returned
here yesterday, passengers on the liner
Sonoma. That Is they are all here but
Blake and Amber. Blake is going to
conquer or die, and he stayed in Aus
tralia to fight the battle alone. Maude
Amber is coming on the next steamer.
She would have been on the Sonoma,
say those who returned yesterday, but
for the wicked machinations of Harry
feints', the manager of the outfit and
the only man, say the disappointed
troupers who profited by the visit to
the Antipodes.
Each of the twenty-five troupers
has the idea that but for the oth/r |
twenty-four he or she would have
"knocked the Colonials silly," and
each of the former Fischerites landed i
en Pacific-street wharf with hammer .
in hand.
"If James didn't make money what :
about that big diamond he didn't have
when we went away?"
"We had them lashed to the mast I
and hollering for mercy when Corinne
Carkeek shot off her mouth about the
style of the Australian women. Then
the lights went out."
"We made a mistake when we took
this bunch of chorus girls."
"We didn't have no features the
Australians could understand. If it
hadn't been for us girls the show
would have went to pieces the first
week."
"There aint no Germans over there."
And so on. As to what really hap
pened, it is hard to find out from the
troupers, who have not saved' or are
not exhibiting the criticisms printed
in the Australian newspapers, and
all take solid comfort in the fact that
they rode home. "And first class,
too."
"And they didn't have to pay their
own fares either," >volunteered James.
TWO DARK MYSTERIES.
Two happenings of the home-com
ing are shrouded in mysteryâthe
marooning of Miss Maud Amber and
Mrs. Harry James' two black eyes.
Harry James is said to hold the key
of both mysteries.
As the others tell of the Amber
episode the buxom one-time local fa
vorite was the victim of a deep laid
scheme. James, they say, had reasons
for wanting to be in San Francisco
ahead of Amber. Before leaving Syd
ney he brought suit against the fair
j star for breach of contract, she and
Blake having left the company when
the ghost ceased to take its weekly
walk, about three weeks before the
end of their last Australian engage
ment. Amber was under bonds to ap
pear in court at a date subsequent to
the sailing of the Sonoma. The day
, the Sonoma sailed James hid away on
i board and did not show himself until
I the liner was well out to sea.
Amber was on the wharf to bid the
homeward-bound troupers good-by. T
think that little rat has jobbed me,"
she said as the Sonoma slowly moved
from the wharf. "He's on board, I
know, and is going to stick his head
through a port and laugh at me in a
few minutes. I'll be on the next boat,
anyhow. Good-by, girls! By-by, boys!"
When Blake and Amber left the
company, Blake brought suit against
James for unpaid salary. This suit
James left in Sydney with Amber.
James denies hiding away and de
i clares that the travesty stars and the
â  ship's officers are laboring under a de-
I lusion when they suggest such a thing.
TWO BLACK EYES.
| Then comes the black eye mystery,
j First the story as told by the stars,
i big and little, by the other passengcers
j and by members of the ship's crew.
The attentions of James to Miss Vio
' let Arthur, a dark eyed member of the
! chorus, are said to have aroused the
j anger of Mrs. James. On Saturday af
j ternoon MrÃ. James is said to have dls-
I covered her spouse in Miss Arthur's
i stateroom. There was trouble and in
the thick of it James is said to have
struck his wife between the eyes,
blackening them both.
"Nothing in It," says James. "Wife
hasn't a mark on her. Never struck
her In my life. Hardly know Miss Ar
thur. Dreaming, dreaming, everybody
on this boat is dreaming. If you don't
believe me ask my wife; she'll be down
In a minute."
"Why, the Idea!" said Mrs. James In
the seclusion of her stateroom, where
she remained long after all other pas
sengers had disembarked. Mrs. James
was heaviry veiled, but neither veil nor
the somber light of the darkened room
could hide the ugly evidence of a vio
! lent blow. Both evellds were dlscol
eredjand 4he bridge of the nose showed
red under the heavy veil.
"Mf. James did not hit me. I never

BOARD WANTS
LEGAL ADVICE
Would Know if It Has Power
to Cancel Yorke Contract
for the Repair of Streets
BONDS ARE NUMBERED
Ordinance Passed Providing
for the Validating of Se
curities for Improvements
Th* Board of Supervisors desires le
gal advice before taking steps to can
cel the contract of the F. M. Yorke
Company for repairing bituminous
streets on the ground that the company'
refuses to go on with the work, a notice
to this effect having been filed by the
Board of Public Works. The Super
visors yesterday adopted a report from
the Finance Committee In which the
City Attorney is requested to file an
opinion in answer to these two ques
tions:
L Has the Board of Works, without apeclflo
authorisation of the Board of Supervisors, the
power to enter into a contract for the general
repair of streets?
2. Has the Board of Public Works the right
to resoinl a contract, providing they had the
power to make a contract for the repair of
streets, upon the failure of the contractor to
comply with the requirements of the contract 7
Works Commissioner Aigeltinger sug
gested that bids be Invited and the con
tract be awarded to some responsible
bidder at a lump sum monthly. The
committee did not regard this plan
with favor and thought that the work
should be paid for according to the
square foot after a new contract had
been awarded, if the plan, is legal.
The board passed to print an ordi
nance providing for the numbering of
the municipal bonds and validating all
proceedings in connection with the is
suance thereof. The bonds for the sev
eral improvements are numbered from
"one" upwards for each denomination,
there being 28,400 in all.
Mayor Schmitz filed a recommenda
tion that the City Attorney be author
ized to appoint a fifth assistant City
Attorney at a salary of $150 per month,
the work of the office having greatly
increased owing to proceedings in the
issuance of bonds. An ordinance
that effect was passed to print.
The Board of Works sent a communi
cation explaining the demands of the
Union Machine Company for repairs on
the Fourth and Sixth street bridges.
The letter says that In no in
stance has any of these pieces of work
amounted to over $500 and under' the
charter no contract for the work was
necessary.
The petition of the Sunset Improve
ment Club that provision be made for
the paving with bitumen or asphalt of
the northerly half of H street, from
First to Seventh avenue and from
Twentieth avenue to the Ocean Boule
vard at a cost of $50,000 was referred to
j the Finance Committee.
H. H. Taylor filed a statement of
the operations of the Mills building
electric plant, showing the revenue
during 1904 to have been $1827 and the
expenditures $1094 72. The original cost
of the plant was $10,000 and its present
value is estimated at $500.
The petition of J. B. Seeley that the
obstructions on St. Joseph avenue, be
tween Geary and O'Farrell streets, be
removed as being a nuisance was re
\ ferred to the Street Committee,
j The Board of Works withdrew its
recommendation for the construction of
an asphalt pavement on the northerly
portion of H street, from Seventh to
; Twentieth avenue, recommending that
the street be bituminized at a cost of
$30,000. '
The following ordinances were finally
passed:
Ordering street work on Duboce avenue, be
! tweon Market and Church streets: Eighth ave
-1 nue. between 1 and J streets; Fifteenth street,
opposite Sharon; Lily avenue, between Laguna
| and Buchanan; Lake street, between Twenty -

Cancer & Stomach
CURED BY
Electro-Chemisty
â SsBSSSBBBBsf W
THE TESTIMONIAL OF MRS. WILLIAM
SEALS: "A year ago I was operated on for
cancer of the stomach. I came very near
dying under the operation. In fact the opera
tion was not entirely finished because of my
great danger. After hanging between life and
death for several weeks I was able to leave
the hospital. Before doing so the surgeon
who performed the operation told me that It
would be necessary for me to undergo another
operation of similar character. I felt quite
sure that another operation would have killed
me and therefore put It off. I suffered con
tiguously wtth a serious pain In the pit of my
stomach. For months after the operation the
wound was more or less bothersome, but the
constant .pain In my stomach told me plainly
that the cancer had not been entirely removed.'
In this condition and to escape another opera
tion I placed the treatment of my case In
the care of the Electro-Chemlo specialists at
118 Grant aye., San Francisco. From the be
ginning of the Electro-Chemlc treatment I
found myself Improving. The pain In my
stomach gradually lessened, my appetite grad
ually came back and, best of all. I was able
to digest the food that I ate without any
trouble. From the start of the Electro-Chemlc
treatment I gained In strength and I have
been dismissed thoroughly cured In every way.
The pain is entirely cured. I can eat most
anything I crave and my digestion is normal.
The results in my case have been so truly
wonderful that I feel it my duty to let other
sufferers â¢ know Of my experience with the
Electro-Chemic treatment. I oonslder my case
as bad as a case could well be and this won
derful new treatment simply proved curative
from the beginning."

City Lota Accurately and Officially Surveyed.
CHARGES REASONABLE.
My field books, diagrams show, by actual
measurements, the exact points from which
your lot waa surveyed, which is imperatively
necessary, as the City Surveyor and other sur
veyors do not show that, and also because all
the original monuments were taken out when
the streets were formed In the early days of
the city, since which time the different City
Surveyors extending to the present time have
made innumerable errors In their street and
lot surveys, and to conceal such errors they
have moved the monument lines away from
their original correct positions without legal
authority from the people, causing blocks and
streets to measure incorrectly, creating excess
measurements in blocks of the most valuable
portion of the city, which they do not distribute
proportionately throughout the block, but often
give the entire excess of sometimes 12 Inches
or more to one person, thereby Interfering with
the deed distances of the people and the abso
lute security of boundary lines.
Consult me berore moving your valuable
buildings on such unfair surveys. Work guar*

PROPOSE STATE
LAND HOLDING
Miners' Association Sends
Memorial to Sacramento
Concerning Keclamation
PROFIT IS SUGGESTED
Cost of Public Works to Be
Paid for Under Leases
When Fully Accomplished
The executive committee of the Cal
ifornia Miners' Association has adopt
ed a resolution memorializing the Cal
ifornia Legislature to pass a bill to
provide for acquiring title to all the
swamp and overflowed lands on the
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
and their tributaries that the engin
i eers report to be necessary to use In
the reclaiming of said lands to be held
by the State and leased, the income to
be applied to the payment of the
moneys expended by the StAte in re
clamation.
This resolution was forwarded to
Governor Pardee and Senator Belshaw
yesterday by President Benjamin of
the California Miners' Association.
With the resolution went explanatory
letters.
President Benjamin said last even
ing that he believed that the State
should be reimbursed for any expense
that it incurs in reclaiming the swamp
and overflowed lands, as all the State
would have to pay was its share of the
reclamation cost in taxes. The exec
utive committee of the Miners' Asso
slation favors the work of reclamation
that is proposed. The benefit of the
work should not come to a relatively
small number of property owners
when the entire State is asked to pay
millions of dollars in the future for
the Improvement to be made. If the
State had the lands, after they are re
claimed, they could be made a source
of much revenue. That was the intent
of the resolution. The resolution is
as follows:
Resolved, That this association memorialize
the Legislature of the State of California to
enact a law authorizing and empowering the
State to acquire title to all the swamp and
overflowed lands on the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers and their tributaries that the
engineers report to be necessary to use in the
work of reclaiming said lands, and in preserv
ing the navigability of said rivers, either by
voluntary conveyances from the present own
: ers of said lands or by the exercise of the
| right of eminent domain, such lands to be re
! talned and held by the State, and when re
: claimed to be leased by the State and the
rents accruing therefrom to be applied to the
payment of the Interest and principal of the
moneys expended by the State In such work
of reclamation and preservation.
A memorial addressed to President
Roosevelt by the Miners' Association
requesting the assistance of the Geo
logical Survey in making a study of
those portions of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys affected by detri
tus from torrential streams as a part
of the Investigation concerning the
storage of flood waters and the recla
mation of waste lands in this State
was also sent to Washington by Pres
ident Benjamin yesterday.
Grand Jurors Angry.
Grand Jurors Andrews and Bowes
are angered over the injunction that
has been issued by the Superior Court
restraining them from making arrests
in Belden place. Last night they
summoned a number of the women
habitues before them and made in
quiry toward learning how the writ
was obtained. The committee also
had two witnesses before them on a
matter presented by Prank A. Schmidt
jln connection with the denial of his
j petition at the last meeting of the Po
! lice Commission to open a saloon at
Pell and Franklin streets. He tried
to make it appear that Commissioner
Drinkhouse was responsible for the
action of the board.
Iroquois Braves.
The Iroquois braves of California

THE RUSSIAN DISTURBANCE.
How the Financiers Regard the
Situation.
How tha Russian outbreak is viewed on the
bourses is shown in the following wires from
"Wall street to _Â». F. Hutton & Co. yesterday:
â¢t> V**^ 3 ' 1 "* b^ nd Â« depressed and rioting in St.
I eterebuig. Japanese bonds In London strong
on the belief that the Internal troubles of
Russia will lead to peace In the Far East
"A banker who is familiar with Russian af
faire says: Tt is cafe to say that the ma- ;
Jorlty of reports bearing on the uprising in
Russia have been exaggerated. The so-called
revolutionists are unarmed and unorganised
and an overthrow of the present dynasty is !
improbable. It would require comparatively
. fe.w troops to break up a revolution The
Russian uprising Is certainly another step
toward a declaration of peace between Russia
and Japan.'
"The foreign markets were all weak to-day
on the international political troubles and the
situation was reflected here In our prices dur
ing the entire session. Our market was com
pelled to absorb quite heavy offerings of our
active Issues during the early part of the day,
but the securities seemed to be readily taken
without any important declines. The situa
tion appears serious at St. Petersburg, but
we believe events will shape themselves Into
a normal condition within a few days. In
that, case the security markets generally will
reflect the situation by showing material
strength."

â¢ Now York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 23.âThe revolutionary
â¢ taken by affairs at St Petersburg over
HI Sunday interval proved a disturbing ln
fttienca to-day in all of the world's markets.
â¢ Meet was quite as acute in Wall street
â¢ on. any other market, although the results
to be expected In New York would be less
Lhun in European markets. But the
Kuaaiaa crisis proved to be the deciding factor
.ft, a tendency which was already growing up
â¢last week New York toward a spirit of hes
. ICation and -~.>i .. k>n. in fact, when our
ftulrket opened the day was already so far
.advanced in St. Petersburg owing to the dif
ference in time that the more tranquil condl
. Uens there were known to be established.
The early .weakness on.foreign stock'markets
. had also" passed away to some extent and
effective recoveries had been achieved. Yet
'prices here broke all the way from 1 to 2% j
points for the prominent active stocks in the i
first few minutes of trading and the feverish !
ti.ntest between the opposing tendencies was
n"t directed in favor of the recovery until the
first hour had about expired. There was some
cibsequential effect on the side of depression
In .the shape of selling for European account
In this market, which reached unusually large
' proportlona But considerable Influence must
.be allowed for the over-extension of business,
buying comkng over from last week's market,
and left in a vulnerable position. Efforts to
Interpret the events in St. Petersburg were
confused and varied. The programme of the
revolutionary propaganda In Russia undoubt
edly Impresses the financial world, but there
. was question whether the Sunday outbreak was
perfectly identified with the revolutionary
movement believed to be in contemplation.
â¢ Sentiment during the day became more re
assured and there was considerable recovery.
The market was not entirely free from its
feverish tone and the disposition was rather
%â > -await events than to enter on new courses.
When the time had passed for the operations
1 for foreign account the tendency, however, was
quite clearly toward recovery. The settle
ment of the threatened Pennsylvania strike

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 23.âPossibility oi a de- |
create In shipments from Russia as a result j
of public disorder caused a tironÂ», tlniEh in
the wheat market here to-day. At the cloÂ»e ,
the May delivery was up vale, corn la up j
%w%d. oats show a gain ot Â£c and provisions :
aie up 5c to 7%c. !
The strength with which the wheat market
closed was not In evidence earlier in the ses- ,
slon. At the opening the sentiment In the
pit was Inclined to bearishness in spite of
the bullish tendency of weekly statistics. <
World's shipments were considered small, and i
the amount on passage was coresponalngly <
light. As an offset, however, receipts In the 1
Northwest showed decided Increases, In con- '
Sequence the market at Minneapolis was gen- '
eraily weak. Traders here were more Inclined â¢
to be governed by domestic conditions than by
the foreign situation. Opening quotations on 1 '
May were a shade higher to %t*%c lower at (
$1 13% to $1 14%. While the pit crowd gen- I 1
eraily was bearish the desire on the part of
many traders to sell wheat short was held In !
check by a rumor that a leading long was sup- !
porting the market. Selling was likewise re- â¢; ,
strained by the critical condition of affairs in ' â¢
Russia. A tear was entertained that further
violence might result disastrously to Russia's I
commerce and perhaps cause a stoppage of !
grain exports from that country. After trad- ]
Ing was well under way sentiment became a
little firmer. May advancing to $1 14%. Weak
ness of Northwestern markets, however; was 1
a constant drag on prices here, and with the ' i
announcement of liberal primary receipts
commission houses turned active sellers. Un- ; 1
der this pressure May declined to $1 13%.
Late in the day. however, the market devel
oped considerable activity with â¢ a sharp rise |
in values. Dispatches from St. Petersburg
added to the anxiety of shorts, advices assert- /
Ing a renewal of disturbances at the
capital. From $1 13% May quickly advatlWd
to $1 15%. May closed almost at the highest ,
point of the day, the quotations on May being
81 15. Clearances of wheat and flour were |
equal to 60,600 bushels. The amount on pas- 1
sage decreased 1,536,000 and the visible supply' i '
decreased 202,000 bushels. Primary receipts ' :
were 926,900 bushels, compared with 189 500 i
bushels a year ago. Minneapolis, Duluth and 1
Chicago reported receipts ' 931 cars, against ' 1
676 cars last week and 461 cars a year ago, ! '
Pit traders were free sellers of corn early In j
the session, resulting In some weakness, but !
later the market became somewhat firmer. 1 1
May opened unchanged. %c higher at 44 %o !
to 44%Â®44%c, sold up to 46c and closed at 1
the top. Local receipts were 347 cars.
A steady tone prevailed In the oats market
and .trading was .largely of scalping character.
May opened unchanged to a shade higher at 1
30%p30%c, sold between 30% c and 81c and
closed at 30%@31c. Local receipts were 142
cars. 1
A gain of 10c in the price of hogs at the
yarda caused fairly active covering of pro
visions by shorts, resulting In a firm market.
At the close May pork was up 17 %c at $12 95.
Lard was up 6@7%c at $7 02%. Ribs were 1
10c higher at $6 85<8>6 87%.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow: Wheat,

the arrival of the belated train, which brought

Butter. Cheese and Fags.
The opening of the week found Butter a
very scarce article among the commission
merchants, with prices still higher and the
market stiff. Steamers expected did not ar
rive, being delayed by rough weather outside
and an urgent demand for Portland, Puget
Sound and Loe Angeles, to say nothing of a
good local demand, kept the doors hare of
good stock. Even higher prices than those
quoted below were obtained by some houses,
who took advantage of the scarcity to ptit the
screws on the market. The current rise has
led to an improved demand for storage cubes,
wh! h are again coming out of store fr-ely.
There was no fuither decline in Eggs and
most houses repTirtsd a fair movement though
the advertisement of a large retail house,
offering the nubile the best ranch at 25c. tend
ed to unsettle the situation. Receipts were
free for Monday, as will be seen. Eastern

WOULD AMEND
DIVORCE LAWS
Co-operation of Methodists
on Vital Matter Is Sought
by Eev. F. W. Clampett
BONDS AEE TIGHTENING
Sees Closer Federation of
Protestant Denominations
During Last Three Years
Existing divorce laws encountered
scathing denunciation at the hands of
the Rev. Frederick W. Clampett, D.
oD., rector of Trinity Church, yester
day at a meeting of the Methodist
Ministers' Association. Dr. Clampett,
one of the foremost ministers of the
Protestant Episcopal church, was
there to enlist the co-operation of the
Methodist body in urging the amend
ment" of the laws of divorce, as well as
restriction as to marrying divorced
persons.
0 Dr. Clampett expressed his delight
that during the last two or three years
there had been a closer federation be
tween the Protestant denominations
and he sought still further union in
aJI questions vital to civic life.
He told of the active steps lately
taken by Bishop Potter and Bishop
Greer of New York relative to hous
ing of the poor, the tenements and
dealing with the poor, but one of the
most vital of the questions under con
sideration, he said, was that of mar
riage and divorce. He spoke of the
large meetings held in New York,
where it was realized that something
must be done toward the preservation
of the sanctity of the "home life of
the nation." Referring to the great
convention of the Protestant Episco
pal church held in Boston, the doc
tor said that though the missionary
life was never before so enthusiastic
ally treated the question of the laxity
of divorce and remarrying eclipsed all
others in interest.
Giving the figures, 60,000 divorces in
the United States in one year, 1600 of
which number were credited to San
Francisco, Dr. Clampett said it was
admitted that there was something
radically wrong when such laxity of
the laws regarding marriage was pos
sible." The rottenness of social life, he
declared, was at the top, and not at
the bottom. It was not with the wage
earner, whose home surroundings
would be found pure and untainted.
Asking for the support of his hear
ers, the doctor said that "all Protest
ant ministers should forget their lit
tle subordinate differences, which
were in reality only subordinate, and
then they would arouse Christian con
science on the matter." He advocat
ed a great meeeting of citizens as an
outcome of joint action of the minis
ters of the Protestant denominations.
After remarks from Dr. W. S. Mat
thews, the Rev. A. C. Bane, Dr. F. D.
Bovard. Dr. Francis Larkin, the Rev.
James H. N. Williams and the Rev.
Mr. Burleigh, all agreeing with the
speaker, the Rev. Dr. J. W. Ross
moved to appoint a committee of the
Methodist ministers to take action In
the matter. The resolution was car
ried unanimously, those appointed to
act being Dr. George W. White. Dr.
Bovard and Dr. Matthew.
Dr. Clampett, before taking his de
parture, announced that President
Macintosh of the San Francisco Sem
inary, San Anselmo, and Dr. Brown of
the First Congregational Church.
Oakland, had promised to give the
proposed movement their hearty sup
port.

ATTEMPT TO TAKE BOY
FROM HUMBOLDT SCHOOL
Divorced Parents Try to Obtain Pos
session of Son Formerly Award
ed to the Mother.
Considerable excitement among the
children assembled in the yard of the
Humboldt School was caused yester
day by the frantic efforts of Gertrude
King and her divorced husband to
obtain possession of their 12-year-o.d
boy. The couple was divorced several
years ago in Yuba County and the
mother was awarded the custody of
the infant.
Recently the mother brought suit
for failure to provide alimony and it
is believed that the father retaliated
by attempting to recover possession of
the boy. To do this he enlisted the
' services of a deputy sheriff and pro
ceeded to the school. '
In the meantime the mother learned
of the maneuver and both parents ar
rived simultaneously. Each grabbed
the boy and the tug of war that re
sulted was stopped by the principal.
Miss Elizabeth Kelly, who resolutely
declined to let the child be taken
away. During the argument Deputy
Superintendent Deasy arrived and
Judiciously ended the strife by advising
both parents to consult a lawyer.

"FATTY" BLODES ABLY PARRIES BLOWS

Alleged Debtor Resents Jeers and
Makes Cyclonic Visit to Groggery.
To former prize-ring experience and j
the art of sidestepping thereby ac
quired "Fatty" Blodes unquestionably
owed his ability to appear as a com
plainant in Police Judge Mogan's court
instead of posing as a. nadly battered
patient in the Emergency-Hospital or as â¢
the occupant of a slab in the Morgue, j
The testimony showed that a per-1
son possessed of less agility in Mr. |
Blodes' place would have stopped the
Iron cuspidor and other heavy mis
siles hurled at him with great strength
and excellent aim. By nimble foot
work, however, Mr. Blodes dodged
them, although a protracted period of
inertia and its resultant piling on of
avoirdupois had unfitted him for such
physical exercise. When the fusillade
was finished he was short on wind but
unscathed, and the interior of his
saloon at Page and Franklin streets
looked as if it had been made the ex
clusive recipient of a severe earthquake
shock. Among the distressing exhibits
were a wrecked backbar and a shat
tered mirror that had cost much
money.
John E. Foss. tall, slender and spec
tacled, pleaded that he had been more
than r mply provoked to commit the
demolition. It was at no inanimate tar
get, but at the person of Mr. Blodes
himself, the cuspidors were projected,
and if Mr. Blodes preferred having his
property instead of his anatomy shat
tered it was his fault that the mirror
and other things were broken. Also, if
Mr. Blodes had not systematically an
gered the defendant, there would have
been no attempt on the letter's part to
break anything. What had Mr. Blodes
done? Well, he had stood at the door
of his saloon and gibed and Jeered the
defendant. Mr. Blodes had said the de
fendant owed him sixty cents âwhich
claim, by the by, was disputedâand
every time the defendant passed the
saloon Mr. Blodes would rush to the
door and shout at him, "Hay foot,*
straw foot, hay foot, straw foot, what
about that sixty cents?" repeating the
offensive words, in sing-song style, un
til the defendant was beyond hearing.
At last the worm turned, and the cus
pidor-throwing followed.
More testimony will be heard next
Thursday.

Until the nolice have discovered the
woman who was at the bottom of Pat
rick Smith's attempt to shoot Fred
Brown last Saturday night in the Ferry
Hotel, 48 East street, Judge Mogan will
not hasten a hearing of the case. Smith

A plump, pleasant-faced young wo
man introduced herself as Mrs. Donald
McCloud to several attaches of De
partment No. 1 and said she was in
search of evidence that would
strengthen her contemplated divorce
proceedings, as her husband it was
who posed as co-defendant with the
Misses Lillie Burgess and Edith Page
on the charge of having robbed Ralph
Scott of a gold watch and $11 after
he had invited them to supper in a
Sixth-street restaurant. She had read ,
the newspaper reports of the arrrest, i
trial and dismissal of the trio, but she
thought the testimony might have de- !
veloped something ament her hus
bond's conduct which the scribes had
overlooked, although the fact of his
heving been the escort of two young |
girls without her permission, or even ,
knowledge, was sufficient to obtain '
her decree. She wondered what the
girls must have been thinking about
when they placed themselves under
Donald's ciceronage, for, leaving the
matter of his being a benedict out .of \
the question, there was nothing cap- j
tivatlng in either his physical or in- I
tellectual make-up. But she guessed '
all girls must be more or less crazy, >
else she never would have married
Donald McCloud, when she had her
choice of accepting any one of half a
d( zen fellows who were his peers In
manly grace and conversational abil
ity. When she was assured by the
court stenographer that his notes of i
the testimony would not provide her ,
with additional material for her com
plaint and petition, she seemed rather
dirappointed.

Haughtily advancing to the bench,
James H. Parkhill thrust his right :
hand between two buttons of his tight
ly closed frock coat and demanded
that he be heard, but' Judge Mogan in
formed him that first hearing was due
the policeman who had arrested him
for begging in the Palace Hotel.
"Oh, of courseâof course," said Mr.
Parkhill, withdrawing his hand and
waving it deprecatingly. "The police
man must not be kept waitingâoh,
dear, noâha! ha!"
So he stood and scowled while the
policeman told of having caught him
fairly in the act of soliciting alms and
of subsequently discovering that he
was possessed of a silver dollar.
"And what is a dollar?" said Mr.
Parkhill. "It may appear a consider
able sum to you, sir, but to me it is
paltryâpaltry, sir. It's true I had that
dollar and knew I had it. But my ar
rest was unmerited, sir, because the
gentleman you found me talking toâ
begging from, If you pleaseâl had mis
taken for a friend of mine from Noo
Yawk. Yes, I'm a Noo Yawker and a
man of standing. Why did I beg when
I had a dollar? Because, sir, I had
been Invited to dine at Berkeleyâyes,
with a friend from Noo Yawk, a schol
arly man, sirâand always make It a
point to tip the servants. That dollar,
sir, was reserved to be given to the
butler. The money I intended to bor
row would have been spent in the pur
chase of ferry tickets, t Is my explana
tion satisfactory, sir, or is this miser
able farce to continue?"
"I'm afraid we must continue It, al
though your story isn't half bad," said
the Judge. "Since arresting you the
policeman has discovered that you're
a professional beggar and spend your
gains In cheap wine shops."
" 'Tis true, I drink wine," Mr. Park
hill confessed, "but it is not cheap
wine."
Then he was remanded for sentence.

Protest Against the Transfer
of Primary Classes to
the Noe Valley School
The Supervisors' Finance Commit
tee yesterday ordered a letter sent to
1 Mayor Schmitz, again calling his at
| tention to the fact that the official
j bonds of Supervisor Finn, ex-Works
! Commissioner Casey and Fire Com
: nissioner Parry do not answer the
requirements of the charter and the
city has had no financial protection on
the bonds for the acts of the officials
. named since July 26.
| Expert Williams filed a report
| pointing out that the surety companies
lon the bonds of Finn, Casey and Par
;ry are not doing business in this State
1 and that the surety company on the
bond of Works Commissioner Macs
; trettl has filed a notice of withdrawal
as surety thereon. A copy of the re
! port was also sent to the Mayor.
The report says the old bonds of
Supervisor Bent and Police Commis
| sioner Hutton has been insufficient,
! but the two officials corrected the
i matter by filing new bonds with ade
quate sureties. The fact that ex-Cora
missioner Casey's bond was not in
proper shape would prevent holding
him or his sureties responsible on
judgments for damages recovered
against him. This defect also ap
plies to the bonds of Finn, Parry and
Maestretti.
The letter to the Mayor says that
he was informed some time ago as to
the defectvie bonds but failed to re
quire the officials named to furnish
new and adequate security.
The West of Castro Street Improve
ment Club yesterday filed a protest
with the Supervisors against what it
terms "an outrageous injustice per
petrated upon residents and taxpayers |
of the district by the Board of Educa-
Hob in transferring the grammar j
classes of the Noe Valley school to the j
James Lick school and the primary ,
classes of the latter to the former I
school." It is stated that this causes
small children to travel a number of
unnecessary blocks.
The Supervisors granted a permit to
the Illinois Pacific Glass Company to >
lay a spur track from the Southern !
Pacific tracks on Harrison street to
the works of the company on Fifth- :
teenth street. A similar permit was ,
granted to the Tubbs Cordage to con- i
nect the east track of the Santa Fe
Railway Company on Indiana street
with the new rope warehouse.
The sum of $385 20 was ordered re- j
turned to J. D. Spreckels & Brothers
Company to satisfy a Judgment ob- I
trined on protested taxes for schools â 
and a hospital. Several other judg- j
ments of the same kind were ordered â

A meeting of the executive commit- j
tee of the California League of Mu#Â»j
tual Building and Loan Associations \
has been held at the office of the sec- j

Clark of Berkeley, W. S. Gould of Oak
land, George W. Lovie of Redwood
City, David Hirschfeld of Alameda,
Andrea Sbarboro, Albert Meyer and
John Henderson of San Francisco.
The possible injurious effect of recent
publications upon building and loan as
sociations was discussed and resolu
tions were adopted to the effect that
the officers of the league be instructed
to use every effort to demonstrate the j
difference between the "get-rich-qulck"

WANDERS FROM HIS HOME
TO MEET DEATH IN PARK
i Fox From Sutro Forest Gets McLar
en's Birds and Is Shot by
Policeman Clarke.
A silver fox that left his home in the
! Sutro forest on the Peaks and
took himself into Golden Gate Park,
where there was an abundance of rich,
: juicy game to be had for their capture,
j came to grief yesterday when Police
| man George Clarke sent a bullet into
hid body.
A trail of feathers left by his foxship
on the park paths warned Superintend
ent John McLaren an unwelcome vis
itor was within the sacred lnclosure
for his health and appetite and not for
the good of the many feathered pets.
Consequently a request was made on
Chief Wittman for one of his crack
! shots to lie in wait for the intruder.
! Clarke, who has the reputation of being
j able to cut the wire on a champagne
I bottle without disturbing the cork, was
detailed to make a corpse of the
I prowler.
This he did by sending a bullet direct
I through the fox's heart. Mr. Fox will,
I when stuffed, be added to the museum
! collection as a warning to others of his
' species to keep clear of the people's
; pleasure grounds and not feast on the
[ pretty birds under municipal protec
tion. |
JAPANESE MAN FORCED
TO REMARRY HIS WIFE
Pretty Maiden of Fifteen Arrive* to
Meet Her Husband Whom She
Has Never Seen.
Otsuna Iki breaks the record as
the most handsome Japanese girl who
lever visited this State. She arrived
the other day by the steamship Man-
I ohuria to meet her husband, Kanglro
j whom she married, '.'by photo-
I graph" In Japan a few weeks ago. Al
| though such marriages are legal ac
| cording to the law of Japan, the
j United States Immigrant Office at this
I port does not recognize thehi as
| marriages, and requires in all such
; cases that the husband shall marry his
undivorced wife a second â¢ time. So
Otsura was sent to Miss Lake's mis
sion, and Kanglro was told to get a li
cense. The husband was refused the
license because his wife is only 15
years old. Miss Lake will apply for
letters of guardianship, then will give
her consent and the ceremony will be
performed.
Kangiro Iki is superintendent of the
Winchester ranch near San Jose, and
1 bears a good reputation. .
SISTERS ACCUSE
THEIR BROTHERS
File Contest Against Will
of Woman Who Gave Her
Big Fortune to Two Sons
INFLUENCE IS CHARGED
Jacob and Samuel Fischer
Are Said to Have Made
Mother Ignore Daughters
The expected contest of the late
Mrs. Rosalia Fischer's will was filed
yesterday In behalf of her two daugh
ters, Hannah and Augusta Samter, by
their attorneys, P. F. Dunne, W. p.
Johnson and Samuel W. Samter. Their
petition for revocation of the probate
of the testament bristles with charges
against their brothers, Jacob A. and
Samuel A Fischer, one an attorney
and the other a mining man.
It Is set forth that Albert Fischer,
the father of the four young; persons,
died in 1890, leaving his entire estate
of $125,000 to his widow. The daugh
ters, who married men of the same
name, were then living in Memphis,
Term. Jacob Fischer is said to have
been in debt, and Samuel penniless.
Jacob, it is said, wanted to^ acquire a
Tuolumne County mine, and his
mother advanced him $75,000 for the
deal. Then she bought shares for the
other brother. Again, Jacob Is said
to have put up $25,000 of her securi
ties as collateral for one of his debts
and these securities were sold. Sam
uel, too, is charged with having ob
tained large amounts from his* mother
in furtherance of the alleged conspir
acy of the brothers to get all the
property to the exclusion of the sis
ters.
It is alleged that the mother was
feeble In body and mind whÂ»n she
made her will at the age of 73; that
she was afraid to anger Jacob, and
that both sons professed love for her,
when their only love was for her
money. It is said, too, that the
mother was a German and did not un
derstand English well, and that the
sons "made her the dupe of artifices
and Intrigues." When the will was
made, it is charged that its contents
were misrepresented to her and she
believed that the daughters would get
an equal share. Instead they got
$1000 each, while to the brothers was
given the residue of the estate, which
had dwindled to $32,000. The evi
dence of Jacob's Indebtedness to her
consists of two notes for $52,491.
Mrs. Augusta Samter's family came
here to live In 1892 and the other sis
ter followed in 1897. While the
mother lived with the former for a
while, it is charged that for the pur
pose of removing her from her daugh
ter's attention the brothers sent her
on frequent trips i-nd finally removed
her to Los Angeles, where she was in
the care of a paid attendant-
Ulahov Left for Church.
Tom Ulahov, employed aa "useful
man" In a saloon at 1600 Polk street,
notified his employer last Sunday
mornlhg that he was going to the Rus
sian church to pray for his country's
success against the Japanese army.
Shortly after this praying Russian left
$90 in gold and $15 in silver were missed
out of the drawer. The owner of the
saloon hopes that Ulahov's conscience
will revolt and prompt him to return
the money before the police lay their
hands on him.
LEAVES NO WILL - Herman L. Welch yes
terday petitioned for Utters of administration
upon the estate of his mother, Anna I. Welch,
who died January 6, leaving- an estate valued
at about $20,000. No will has been found and

DOG CAPTURES
MAN'S SLAYER
Special Policeman's' New
foundland Seizes Andrea
Brazilio and Holds Him
BLUECOATS DO THE REST
Five Witnesses to Murder
of Joe Brogedo Aie Being
Detained in City Prison
A Newfoundland dog belonging to
Special Policeman H. Stone has the
credit of capturing Andrea Brazilio,
charged with the murder of Joe Bro
gedo, an old flsrerman, on Sunday
night. Stone is a night watchman at
the yards of the Simpson Lumber Com
pany, foot of Powell street, and
ways has the dog with him.
â¢ Stone, his dog and Policeman Max
Fenner were standing at the corner of
Powell and Francisco streetÃ when they
heard shots from the direction of
Mason and Francisco. They saw Bro
gedo running along Mason street, fol
lowed by Brazilio, who was firing at
Brogedo. They started In pursuit and
followed Brazilio along Vandewater
street, down Powell to Beach, where the
dog seized him from behind and threw
him to the ground. The dog held on
to him till Fenner and Stone came up.
They retraced their steps and in front
of 10 Vandewater street the dead body
of Brogedo was found.
Detectives T. B. Gibson and Braig,
who were detailed on the case, arrested
Sam Alapia, Pletro Bala, Joseph Fan
glo, Angelo Napoll and Dominic Rosirlo
and locked them up pending develop
ments. The police found that these
men and Brazilio and Brogedo had
been carousing In a room in the rear
of a barber shop at the corner of Mason
and Francisco streets and the shooting
began in that room. Brogedo rushed
from the room, followed by Brazilio,
who emptied his revolver at him during
the pursuit. Brazilio threw his revol
ver away, but It was recovered and
contained five empty shells.
It was said by the men arrested that
Brogedo had a revolver and attempted
to shoot Brazilio, but Gibson and Braig
found his revolver at his home, 429 Bay
street. One of them said that a coat
found In the barber shop belonged to
him, but the detectives discovered that
It belonged to the murdered man.
They say they have as yet been unable
to find out the cause of the shooting,
but think it was owing to a dispute
about fishing grounds.
