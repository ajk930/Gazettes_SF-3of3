Herr Beumer further explained that
the plates are differently made. The
American plates are more complicated,
it is more difficult to make joinings and
they require much more costly work.
The American plates average 22 . per
cent thicker than the Krupp plates,
which, upon the basis of the American
price, makes a difference of $103 75 per
ton in favor of the German plates.
BERLIN, March 18.â In the Reich
stag to-day Herr Hue (Socialist) reit
erated an assertion which has been
much discussed in the press for several
years, namely, that Germany pays the
Krupp Company too high for. armor
plate, compared with what the United
States pays. Herr Beumer, for the Ad
miralty, replied that the German prices
vary, according to -the size and quality
of the plates, but, he added, the prices
of the plates for the new battleships
are considerably lower than the Amer
ican.

PORT ARTHUR. March IS.â Accord-
Ing to information received from Rus
sians at Shanghai, during the fighting
at Port Arthur on February 10 and
February 11 the battleship MIkasa was
struck by ten projectiles and serious
ly damaged. Two Japanese battle
ships and two cruisers have been dock
ed for repairs at Nagasaki and Sase
bo, and 200O wounded men are said to
be in the Japanese hospitals.
All the Russian sick and wounded
at Port Arthur are making good prog
ress toward recovery.
The repeal of the anti-Jesuit law has
been a widely discussed question ever
cine* it was voted fn the Bundesrath.
March S. Doubts apparently prevailed
In the Bundesrath itself as to whether
that body was competent to act, since
the delegates of four States refrained
from voting.

BERLIN, March 18. â In the lower
house of the Prussian Diet to-day
Chancellor von Bulow replied to the
criticisms of those objecting to the re
pea! of the anti-Jesuit law and to the
charges that his action in the matter
Â¦xv.1? taken in order to obtain the sup
port of the Center party. Chancellor
\-cm Bulow warmly repudiated the as
sertion that his policy had been in
fluenced by the Center party. He be
lieved he had plenty of supporters, but
even if he stood alone, he would not
allow himself to be turned away from
a course which he considered correct.
The past votes of the Reichstag on this
subject better reflected the opinion of
the German people than the present at
titude of the National Liberals. There
was no question of dependence upon the
Center party, he said, but r.hy not be
accommodating to their Catholic fel
low citizens when it was possible to do
so without injury to the interests of
the state or Protestant church? He had
no intention of exceeding that limit, he
82id.

that . the Japanese Government has re
leased the company's steamship Amer
ica Maru from its auxiliary cruiser ser
vice and the vessel is now being refit
ted in. Nagasaki for- passenger and
freight traffic on the Pacific route. She
Is expected to return to San Francisco
early next month on the run scheduled
for the Hongkong Maru before she was
appropriated by the Mikado. This ex

ately after Agent A very's return here
Thursday afternoon he started Good
rich off for Seattle to catch the next
steamer for the Orient and accompa
nied the purser up the road as far as
Sacramento to give him . instructions
regarding his trip. After A very* s re
turn-to the Palace Hotel yesterday it
was learned that Goodrich is to accom
pany the America Maru back to this
port.
The America Maru was taken over
by the Japanese Government early in
February, just after she had entered
the Japanese waters on one of her reg
ular trips, and was Immediately over
hauled for service as a dispatch boat.
In the event of the Japanese Govern
ment refusing to relinquish the three

â¢TOKIO. March 18. â The first as

Seamew, arriving at Weihalwei from
Shaleithien Island, reports that six
teen transports are at Kaoshan. in
the Miao group of islands, on. which
troops -were embarking yesterday.
Two warships of big build and several
itorpedo-boat destroyers were south
east of Kaoshan. It has been known
for some time that the Japanese
army .was somewhere on .the Malo
Islands in force, but as Admiral Togo
stopped all transportation between the
northerly group' and -this point no in
formation has come from them in
three weeks.
. The Seamew . passed within four
miles of the westerly end ot Kaoshan

GAlA'ESTON, March 18.â Through a
ruling of the Texas State Court, a com
petitor to the sugar trust has been
established in this State. For many
years the large sugar refinery at Sugar
land, one of the largest in the South,
has been operated In connection with
the trust In that the owners fn.con
sideration of a large subsidy agreed to
refine only the sugar grown upon the;*
plantation. When the refinery went
into the hands of the receivers this pri
vate agreement was discovered, and
as under the Texas -law agreement
with trusts are not tolerated this was
declared abrogated and the receiver In
structed to operate the refinery to pro
duce the greatest revenue.
The result of the action of the court
i3 that through negotiations with
Cuban planters arrangements have al
ready been made for the immediate
importation of 17.000.000 pounds of raw
sugar and 1,000,000 pounds additional
are expected to follow in due time. As
there is a paper factory in connection
with the mill, which produces a good
quality of all grades of paper. It is sahl
that the Influence of this factory will
also be felt by the paper trust.

WASHINGTON. . March 1 8. â -"Santo
Domingo is just as black as it is painted,"
is the verdict of Assistant Secretary
Loomis of- the State Department, who
returned to Washington on the United
States ship Mayflower with Admiral
Dewey to-day. While in the'Carib
bean Sea during last month Loomis
visited many' of the principal ports of
Santo Domipgo, where the '.revolution
is now raging. The Mayflower did hot
go up to Santo Domingo City on ac
count of fighting there.
Loomis will; make a report- to -the
President .about conditions in Panto
Domingo and he has some idea of ac
tion which will, tend to restore order
in the black republic.
He found affairs throughout the re
public in a state of most deplorable
uncertainty on account of the revolu
tion. The natural wealth of vegeta
tion on the island made chaos and dis
regard of law and order the more de
plorable. Loomis found W. F. Powell,
United States Minister to Santo Do
mingo, apparently .respected and rec
ognized by -Morales' Government, \ but
it seems he was extremely tired- of
the great amount of work - devolving
upon him as a'result of the revolution.
He told Loomis that: the house in
which he . formerly lived has | been
made, a target, for artillery, fire until
there are.; now. no less than a t dozen
shells in its' walls.' ;
Loomis was disinclined to say. much
about his visit.. except. that reports of
disorder were' not exaggerated."
While this Government will do. what
it can toward" bringing \ order out of
revolution in Santo Domingo, it is not
likely any radicar action will be taken
at this time.". . ,._.... ' /

It is thirty-five years since the dam
was built, but little work has been
done on it since that time, and for
years it has been known that in the
event of a rise in the lake there would
be danger. The Lake Tahoe
Railway will puffer first. This line fol
lows the river from its source to this
town. The grades would be destroyed
and the tracks washed away, and it
would be almost impossible to have the
road repaired in time to handle the
summer traffic. In . addition there are
thousands of cords of wood in the river
bed between here and Tahoe. This
would be swept away* Truckee, with
its box factories and lumber mills,
would suffer most. The loss In dollars
and cents to that town can hardly be
estimated at this time. Floriston, with
its one million dollar paper plant,
would suffer next. Located as it is be
tween two steep mountains and right
on the bed of the river, it would be
wiped out of existence. Verdi, the next
town in its course, would also suffer
greatly. Reno proper, though on '.he
banks of the river, is so high above the
stream that it is thought but little
damage would result. However, in the
Glendale district, the damage would be
almost irreparable. Wadsworth would
suffer to some extent, but by the time
the water could reach that place the
residents would have ample time to
carry their belongings to places of
safety. Reno residents can be warned
four hours before the flood reaches
them.
RENO. Nev., March 18.â From Tahoe
to Pyramid the banks of the* Truckee
River are lined to-night with men
dreading the signal that may come an
nouncing the breaking of the big Lake
Tahoe dam, now being strained to re
tain a body of water ten feet in depth
and covering an area of 196 square
miles. The danger is increasing every
moment and in the event that the mea
ger restraint gives way millions of dol
lars' worth of property will be de
stroyed and miles upon miles of the
richest and most productive land in
this section of California, as well as in
\\~ashoe County, Nevada, will be a
stretch of desolation and ruin.

but that Captain Callindo and a force
Tvhicb arrived from Mazatlan on the
tarac beat with Captain Barron on
Wednesday fought a similar engage

GUA7MAS. Mexico, March IS.â A de
tachrsest of Federal troops, under
Captain Barren, routed a band of
Ta<jui savages near Bataraote Thurs
day morning, killing fifteen of the In
dian* acd wounding at least a score.
The first report of the engagement
came through an official dispatch from
General Torres, now at Hermoslllo, to
the prefect at Guaymas. Captain Bar
ren and the hundred men under him
belonged to a detachment of the
Eleventh Battalion, which arrived re
cently from Mazatlan to garrison th*
cities and towns in the Yaqui country.
Barren was cent to San Jose de Guay
rr.as end was destined to see early ser

that plac*Â» that a howling band of
ravages had c^me down out of the very
mountains which the Federal troops
had supposed to have cleared of the
Eavages in a campaign which ter
minated about ten days ago.
Barren had no accurate reports as to
tfce numbers of thÂ» foe, but tet out in
pursuit with his hundred men. He came
upen the Indians in the Sierras, near
Batamote. Although taken by surprise,
the four ecore savages charged down
a hillside upon the Government irn^y.'.
mistaking the number and strength of
their opponents. The forces under Cap
tain Barron were prepared to take no
chances and they poured a withering
flre in upon the savages, killing and
Â¦wounding almost half of the band. The
Furvivors, terrified by the deadly work
cf thp Mexican rifles, were easily taken

BERLIN, March 18.â The commercial
negotiations between Russia and Ger

The Emperor 'visited the- new Admir
alty dockyard to-day. He was looking
pale, but was cheerful and smilingly
greeted the 17,000 dock worker who
turned out to welcome him. The Em
peror went on board the transport
Kamtchatka and inspected the vessel's
arrangements for accommodating 1000
men. She will be ready in a few
months. The Emperor then boarded
the first-class cruiser Olga. The Olga's
engines are ready, but her turrets and
conning tower are not yet armored,
and her guns are not in position. His
Majesty asked a number of questions
and looked pleased at what he had
seen.
NOT SUFFERING FROM COLD.
A correspondent, on crossing Lake
Baikal, writes:
"The stories of soldiers frozen to
death while crossing the lake provokes
mirth. Personally, I am convinced that
the men are" not' suffering from cold.
Huts at intervals of a few versts pro
vide warmth and refreshment and the
weaker men are driven across In sleighs
well wrapped in furs. Others march the
distance, forty versts (about twenty
six miles) comfortably in a day, and
are glad of the opportunity to stretch
their limbs after the railroad, journey.
The hut* are provided with bells, which
are rung "during snowstorms, and lan
ternshung on the telegraph poles show
the way at night, the ice railroad con
veying the baggage cars, which are

The Red Cross Society is considering
a proposition to fit out an auto-traln

road 350 miles from Mukden, Man
churia, to Blagovetchensk, East Si
beria, on the river Amur, where they
would be placed on board barges for
conveyance to hospitals established
along that river.
An expert in the military organiza
tion says that even presuming there
are four divisions of Japanese at Ping
yang, Korea, they could not venture
to advance until reinforced by two
more divisions, which would require
another month or six weeks. The
writer contends that they could not
advance more than seven miles a day,
owing to the condition of the roads.
He compares PIngyang with Plevna,
and says the great drawback to the
town is that 'it is surrounded by
marshes, which will breed insects and
malaria when the warm weather comes.
act against the wishes of the Korean
Government, the Russians are instruct
ed not to fight them as though they
were troops of a belligerent state, but
to' confine themselves to placing them
under arrest."
The Gazette expresses the hope that
the Anglo-French understanding will
result in a more friendly attitude on
the part of Great Britain toward ,Rus
sia.
A diplomat representing a small Eu
ropean power expresses the hope that
China will join Japan, on the theory
that all the white powers, including
the United States, will then be com
pelled to form a coalition and stop the
war, which would ruin the trade of
the whole world with China. But he
fears Japan realizes the danger and
will decline China's aid.

rlsienne's St. Petersburg correspondent
sends a rumor to the effect that Vice

MOSCOW, March 18.â The provincial
government of Moscow has asked Dr.
Nansen, the Norwegian explorer, for in
formation concerning the kind of pre

during his polar expedition. Dr. Nan

Nansen's Advice Sought.
Hak Sang, Who went b -tween the
Emperor and the legations and was a
frequent caller at the American lega
tion, took refuge in the Palace of Flow
ers, which belongs to the Emperor, but
is kept by a German woman and flies
the German flag. Hak Sang thereby in
creased the suspicion that he was pro-
Russian, and in view of the Japanese
successes he decided to fly from the
country. He asked Minister Allen to
allow him to go to Chefu on the Cin
cinnati. Minister Allen declined to do
bo, unless Japanese Minister Hayashi
had no objections. Hayashi offered
him transportation on a Japanese boat,
but Hak Sang, being afraid to accept,
refused the offer and renewed his ap
peal to be allowed to go on the Cin
cinnati, to which Minister Hayashi con
sented.
SEOUL, March 18. â The United States

Korean general Yi Hak Kyumen and

WASHINGTON, March 18.â The fol
lowing report has been received at the
State Department from Minister Gris
corn, Tokio, February 20: â¢
"In view of the fact that there are
Eome twenty American missionaries in
Fusan and that they are unable to
communicate by telegraph with Mr.
Allen in Seoul, I deemed It advisable
to mention the matter informally to
Baron Komura. In reply to my in
quiries Baron Komura stated that am
ple measures were being taken to pro
tect all foreigners in Fusan and the
Japanese Consul had been instructed
to use every effort to tills end. An
additional number of Japanese police
are being sent to Fusan to be at the
disposal of the Consul.
"In view of these precautions, It
seems hardly likely that the foreign
residents at Fusan will be liable to
any ill-treatment other than that to
which all non-combatants near a siege
of war are subjected."

The Standard's Tientsin correspond
ent says that Paul Lessar, Russian
Minister to China, haB renewed his pro
test against the dispatch of Chinese
forces outside the great wall, and has
intimated that unless they are with
drawn Russia may be compelled to act

The correspondent has had an inter

who expressed surprise at the recent

Russia had profited by buying. Russian
stocks at 'bottom prices. The Minister
declared that the gold reserve in the

if any metal was to be sent to the seat
of war it would be silver, to the use of
which the Orientals were accustomed.
He said the Russian mint was casting
silver bars similar to those employed in

EMPEROR TO OPEN
JAPANESE DIET ON
SUNDAY OR MONDAY
SQUADRON OF CZAR
IS SAID TO HAVE
LEFT VLADIVOSTOK
KOBE. March 18. â Official informa
tion given out here to-day confirms
previous reports to the effect that the
Russian squadron at Port Arthur re
cently made an attempt to break out
of that port. On the night of March 10
Admiral Makaroff with a few undam
aged and repaired vessels under his
flag crept out of the outer harbor. The
night was dark and there seemed a
fair chance of his escaping and effect
ing a Junction with the Vladivostok
squadron.
Admiral Togo's men, however, were
not to be caught napping. On the
morning of March 13 Makaroff's ves
sels found themselves In touch with
Togo's scouts and, knowing that a
strong Japanese fleet had them shut off
from the north, returned to Port Ar
thur, where they still remain.
"Should the Russian troops encounter
Korean forces operating against the
Russians under the influence of Japan
ese officers, who are forcing them to
A communication from the Foreign
Office is published here confirming the
statement that Russia does not regard
Korea as belligerent and will not do
so until there is evidence that Korea
is actively making common cause with
Japan. The communication, after re
iterating the assertion that Russia con
siders it implicitly a neutral state act
ing under pressure by Japan and de
prived of the power of free action, and
that Russia, therefore, cannot regard
as valid any treaty to the benefit of
Japan nor the abrogation of Russian
concessions, proceeds:
The admiral adds that he cannot
understand how such a stupid story
was credited. He expressed the opin
ion that the war would be of long du
ration, judging from the extensive
Japanese preparations, which were
thoroughly understood at Vladivostok,
where war was expected even earlier
than it came.
"We are convinced that the mo
ment has now 1 arrived to stop Anglo
phobe tactics of the Metcherski type
and to show that England's true po
sition is the one she has taken lately,
after which she will know how to
grasp the hand held out by Russia."
The Gazette is surprisingly pro-En^
lifh and says: "Through the -good of
fices of our excellent ally better rela
tions may come between us and our foe.
If so. It would be well not bnly for
ourselves but for Europe in general."
The Novoe Vremya, which Is as rab
idly Anglo-phobe as the London Times
is Russo-phobe. will not admit that the
Franco-Anglo "entente" is possible
until England delivers up Egypt.
Concerning the loss of the cruiser
Boyarin at Port Arthur a private letter
Bays that the vessel struck a floating
mine dropped by the Japanese. Naval
engineers are preparing to raise the
Boyarin, though it is thought doubtful
whether it will be fit for fighting pur
poses, as it is feared that the tremen
dcus concussion more than likely has
etrained the frames.
Admiral Stackelberg, who. on account
of illness, turned over the command of
the Vladivostok squadron to Captain
Reitzenstein. has arrived in St. Peters
burg. He gives an entirely different
version of some of the reports emanat
ing from Japanese sources regarding
the events before he left. The cruise of
his squadron February 9 to February
15 in Japanese waters was made by
order of Admiral Stark, for its effect
upon the - population of Northern
Japan. Admiral Stackelberg denies
that he fired upon Japanese merchant
men in Sangore Straits. He says the
chips were captured and that while at
tempting to convoy them to Port Ar
thur a blizzard sprang up, and not
wishing to endanger the .Russian
cruisers, after taking off the crews and
passengers from the merchantmen, one
of the latter, loaded with contraband
rice, was sunk. The other, which was
a tramp steamer, was released to carry
to the Japanese the story of the pres
ence of the Russian warships in those
waters for moral effect. There never
Â¦was any bombardment of Hakodate,
which is heavily fortified.
EXPECTS A IX>XG WAR.
The Viedomostle says: "We must
admit that England can never be an
enemy and that Germany is con
stantly threatening our frontier. Ger
many makes no secret of the fact that
she wants to increase her colonies.
Accordingly we ought not to quarrel
with Endand. but to use this senti
ment as a buffer with which to pro
tect ourselves from Germany. An al
liance with Japan will not last; where
will England's sympathies go after
ward?
ST. PETERSBURG. March 18. â
The Franco-English "Entente" to-day
occupies premier place and is hailed
with surprising satisfaction.
Sr*clÂ«J XMrpatch to ThÂ« Call.
"Three Chinese bandits a few days
ago attacked a house in' the center of
town. The master of the house Hilled
two of the bandits and a third was
killed by officers.
"The understanding at Port Arthur Is
that the Japanese are proposing to ef
fect a landing west of the Llao River."
"The Japanese squadron is now reck
oned to consist of the battleships Shik
ishima. Patsuse, Yashima, Mikasa,
Asahl and Fuji.
"Port Arthur is exceedingly gloomy
at night, all lights being out. Pickets
patrol the streets, stopping all pedes
trians. . ,
"The enemy, in endeavoring to stand
as far as possible, outside the range
of the Russian batteries, rendered their
own fire ineffective. The people are be
coming used to bombardments and the
Japanese squadron cruising In the off
ing causes little alarm. Occupations
are resuming their wonted course and
many stores have reopened.
"Not a few womeji heroically refuse
to leave Port Arthur, regardless of the
tragic death of Baroness Frank. Dur
ing the height of the cannonading one
woman with dressings for wisclnded
wandered the streets, ready to afford
aid to the wounded.
"A branch of the Russo-Chlnese bank
is doing business and many wives of
officers and soldiers are returning as
sisters of mercy. The land defenses
are strengthened every day and the
troops are eager to fight. The gaiety
and Good spirits of the troops is sur
prising.
"During the engagement between the
Russian and the Japanese torpedo boat
desroyers the boats came Into close
quarters, being within a few fathoms'
length of one another. A torpedo from
the Russian destroyer Vladstini tore off
the stern of one of the enemy's destroy
ers, her captain standing on the bridge
as she sank, amid wild- cries.
"Six hours of firing by the heaviest
guns during the last bombardment did
not demolish a single building, but cost
a few lives. The husband and child of
Baroness Frank, who was decapitated
by fragments of shell flying in through
a window, were unharmed.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 18.â A
correspondent of the press, who has
just visited Port Arthur, telegraphs
from Mukden to-day as follows:
"Despite the various bombardments
at Port Arthur the external aspect of
the city remains unchanged, although
the enemy fired an enormous number
of projectiles. The battleships and
cruisers bear marks of fighting. The
black clouds of smoke from their stacks
overhang the town. The cruiser Pal
lada stands almost repaired In the
drydock,
"Near the entrance of the harbor can
be Been the charred wrecks of the Jap
anese flreshlps. Aboard one of the
farthest out was found the body of a
Japanese officer who had shot him
self. Beside him lay a chart showing
the course of the flreships and the spot
where they sank.
The Russians are entirely confident of
success on land. The Manchurian vil
lagers are very friendly and bring big
supplies of fresh provisions to the mov
ing regiments, receiving cash payments
in Chinese currency. All available
mules have been bought by the com
missary and enormous herds of cattle
are visible, being driven in from the
interior.
CHEFU, March 18.â The launch Nig
ger arrived here to-day from Port Ar
thur. Her captain reports that with
special permission he left Port Arthur
on the morning of March 16. Owing to
heavy weather he took shelter near a
small island midway between Chefu
and Port Arthur. There he met two
Japanese torpedo-boats. The Japanese
searched the launch thoroughly, and
all his papers and letters were closely
scrutinized. Finding nothing to confis
cate they allowed thff launch to pro
ceed. One of the passengers on the
launch says that during his journey
from Harbin to Port Arthur he noticed
great activity at the stations of Muk
den, Lanyang and Haichen. The Rus
sians were sending reinforcements un
der picked officers to the Yalu.
He overheard in a train that the
Russian forces in Korea are estimated
at 99,000 men. No further movements
are planned before General Kuropat

SAN DIEGO, March 18. â A sequel
to one of the most remarkable crimi

disclosed to-day when Public Admin
istrator P. J. Layne. guardian of the
person and estate of Attorney James S.
Callen, now insane at the Highland
asylum, in searching through his
ward's desk came upon a package of
jewelry done up in a silk handker
chief. There were twenty-eight pieces
of jewelry, some worth upward of $100
apiece. A note written by the attor
ney inside the package Informed the
finder that the jewels were the prop
erty of W. II. H. Stowell and must
be returned at the proper time, with
the understanding that they be not
used as evidence. Mr. Stowell was
out here from New York and while
his trunks were at the Santa Fe depot
they were broken open by H. R. Hall,
the night telegraph operator, and his
wife and Jewelry was taken. Some of
it was recovered, at least enough to
convict the prisoners, but most of it
was never found until to-day. . After
being convicted the Halls were sen
tenced to fourteen years each in the
penitentiary, but while their appeal
â¢was pending they escaped from the
County Jail. with a cattle thief named
Brooks and have never been definitely
located? Callen went insane soon after
the Halls escaped and it is but now
that his effects are being examined
by his guardian under order of court.

At an interview to-day Oxnard went
over much the same ground, and of
fered a New York interview as an ex
planation of his recent active opera
tions in the southern counties.
Oxnard pressed the question then, as
he does now. He asked Bard if it would
affect their positions of friendship if he,
Oxnard, should be a candidate, and
Bard replied that it would not or could
not â his attitude being known, he rec
ognized the right of any man to be
come a candidate. Bard at that time
accepted an invitation to dine with
Oxnard. and at the dinner Oxnard put
this question: "As you will not be an
avowed candidate, would you. In case
I became a candidate, do what you
can to help me?"
Bard replied that he could make no
such promise so long as he remained
even a passive candidate. He would be
compelled, he said, to say the same to
any other friend who might announce
himself.
Oxnard. who is announced as in the
race for the toga now worn by Thomas

latter's committee-room this afternoon,
and the two frankly discussed the situ
ation. When Bard returned from Eu

upon him at his hotel in New York and
asked him if he waÂ«? to be a candidate
for re-election, and Bard said then, as
he does now, that he would not offer
himself as a candidate, but would be
pleased to serve if elected.

by the Finns to hold an autopsy. The
doctors made an examination to de

been criminally assaulted prior to the

evidence of violence. The investiga

MURDEK CASE STIRS ILL
FEELING IX ASTORIA
LONDON, March 19.â After a series j
of maneuvers off Portsmouth, which j
were In some quarters held to have*)
demonstrated that submarine torpedo
boats had come very near In some re
spects to revolutionizing naval warfare,
there is this morning recorded a ter- j
rible disaster, by which what here Is j
regarded as the most perfected type of j
these vessels in the world has baen lost i
with all hands.
This is the submarine boat known in
the British navy as No. Al. a craft of
nearly 200 tons, almost double the size
of the original type of the Holland j
submarine boat built for the British
navy. Great things had been expected
of No. Al. which was said to be In
many respects an Improvement on the
earlier type, but as a matter' of fact â¢
during the later Portsmouth maneuvers !
smaller boats proved more successful. ;
Details of the accident did not reach I
London till a late hour. When they j
came they were found to be dramatic
indeed.
The submarine was lying beneath the j
surface of the sea. waiting for a battle
ship, when she was struck by a Donald
Currle liner. The liner passed on and
reported that the had struck a torpedo. '
Investigation, however, proved that the
supposed torpedo was the submarine
boat No. AL
The wrecked vessel lies within a half
mile of the Nab lightship off Hem
bridge, Isle of Wight, in seven fath
oms of water. She took with her to
the bottom Lieutenant Loftus Charles
Ogllvy Mansergh, who was in com
mand and who was eenior of the lieu
tenants engaged in submarine work;
Sub-Lieutenant John Preston Churchill
and nine petty officers and seamen.
Eleven in all were lost.
The vessel has always been a bad
diver, in fact the worst in the whole
British submarine flotilla, although she
was built upon the most improved
model and was the newest of the fleet.
The name of the liner which struck
the submarine boat is the Berwick
Castle, from East London. South
Africa. The loss. of the boat was not
known for several hours after the liner
had reported to the maneuvering fleet
that she had struck a torpedo. Tht
officers of the liner say that they saw
a glittering torpedo-like shape in the
water and it is supposed therefore that
the submarine boat rose Just before
she was struck. The officers of the
fleet did not suppose for a moment
that the submarine had been struck
and continued operations, expecting
that vessel to reappear at some other
point. . Finally a search was made and
the breaking of the waves revealed the
presence of the submarine boat.
There is no doubt that all the mem
bers of the crew died in the steel tube.
It is thought that the Berwick Castle
in striking upset the trim of 'the boat
and spilled the gasoline in the tanks
rendering her helpless. The crew was
battened down and must have met
death from suffocation in the absence
of air and"" owing to the fumes.

Letters of administration upon tha
estate cf the late Palagia Mar'.e Krzy
zanow3ki were granted the Public
Administrator by Judge Kerrigan yes
terday aftemccn. The case has been
dragging in the courts for some time
and has attracted considerable atten
tion on account of certain allegations of
fraud, mismanagement and conspiracy.
The executor of the estate was re
moved some months ago. and in giving
the administratorship to Public Admin
istrator Hynes the Judge stated that
sufficient evidence had been produced
before hlm\n the shape of records of
other courts to warrant him in mak
ing an investigation.
The case has assumed many aspects.
The deceased willed her property to one
Charles Rickman. who is represented
by Attorney G. W. Parry- The amount
involred was but $23,000. and Rickman
was named executor. Then one Marie
Nightengale came to the front and pro
claimed herself a daughter of the de
ceased and asked for a division of the
estate. She was represented by Attor
neys Nagle & Nagle, but just, before thÂ»
case went to the jury it was compro
mised and Marie was given J10.000. Tha
Public Administrator will contest this
on the ground that while Judge Troutt
gave the order for drawing that
amount of money from the banks, he
did not designate to whom it should be
paid.
Now comes Aloyxy Sylvester Borow
ski. a resident of Austria, who claims
that he was a nephew of. the deceased
and her only living relative. He is rep
resented by Pence & Golla. A discus
sion arose yesterday afternoon as to
the method of proving hl3 relationship,
but the Judge decided that It should be
done by deposition rather than by a
bill of particulars. Rickman has now
combined forces with Miss Nightengale
in opposing both the appointment of
the Public Administrator and, the In
troduction of Borowski into the matter,
and the fight promises to be a lively
one when it comes to an Issue.
Attorney Kickey. for the Pub
lic- Administrator, in asking for
letters upon the estate quoted
from the records, in which it wa3 al
leged by one party or another that
Rickman had been conspiring to secure
mest of the estate and that he had
paid out exorbitant sums of money use
lessly. One of the items was a funeral
bill for O200. but Rickman says he op
posed the payment of this. Attorney
Parry *Â° T Rickman offered an Itemized
statement of all money expended, and
said that all expenditures had been au

Altman and Sullivan were not con
vinced that the board had the right un
der the city charter to grant the Tem
plar petition. They promised to take
the subject under advisement and re
port their findings later on.
An impressive delegation consisting
of Judge W. W. Morrow of the United
States court. Judge John Hunt of the
Superior Court of California and Henry
Kowalsky, a friend of both courts,
waited on the Park Commissioners In
reference to the proposed Hall McAllis
ter statue. In brief and lucid fashion
Judge Hunt explained that $3600 had
been raised to erect the monument, and
suggested that a site on McAllister
street near City Hall avenue be desig
nated by the board. The designer of
the statue, the well known, sculptor,
Robert Aitken. accompanied the dele
gation and produced the design in min
iature drawing. In the reproduction
of the proposed carved inscription only
two errors in spelling were noted by
the Commissioners, but the inscription
is brief and the words are not pon
derous. Originality Is also one of the
features of the design. Commissioner
Altman, the artist member'of the com
mission, paid a tribute to the beauty
of the design and, the eminence of the
sculptor. On motion of Commissioner
Sullivan a site on McAllister street at
City Hall avenue was granted.
To-day Mr. Altman and Mr. Aitken
will view the premises and decide upon
the exact spot' for the statue. The
figure. 7 feet 9 inches high, will rest
on a base eight feet high.

of wine, flowers and fruit. Perhaps 40.

bottle of Itself a thing bf beauty and a

nounced that she had seen the District
Attorney and Chief of Police Wittman
in regard to the enforcement of the law

Presidential Aspirant Asks for Ap- j
polntment of Committee to In- j
vestigate Combinations. - I
WASHINGTON. March 18.â Repre- j
Bent&tire Hearst of New York to-day :
introduced a resolution providing for !
an investigation of the trust' question j
by a committee of five members of the !
House. The resolution contains ten j
clauses reciting the evil effects of trusts j
on the country, among them being thej
following: i
Sumfrous illecal combinations known as
trusts have been torav-d 10 aitrorb or eliminate
comj>etitjon and establish virtual monopolies ;
with a view to controlling production and !
raising the price of their products. :
Such extortionate trusts ae the boef trust j
and the coal trust and the ice trust have ar- j
bitrariJy jn<T-ea.Â«ed the cost of the necessities j
K>f life to t'ie public. I
Such FrÂ«culative trusts as the shipyards |
truft and the stf-Â»;l trust have inflated their j
stock to many timÂ«*s it? actual value and sold
it to the public, transferring- the people's j
money from banks and Ifgliirnate investments j
into the i>ockets of tract promoters and specu
lators.
Industrial Â¦ unrpFt ha? been fomented by the'
iscreased cosrt of living and by the consequent
necersary effort? of !abÂ«-;r to make its wages
keep pace with the Increased cost of living.
Bach trusts as the steel trust, in spite of I
the increased con of living, have ruthlessly']
cut down the wapf s of hundreds cf thousand^ ,
of employes in order to pay dividends on xva.- ''Â¦
t^red stock, and other trusts have wholly col- j
lapsed, throwing hundreds of thousands of j
workmen out of e-mDloyiuent. !
The purchasing power of the community has
J>een diminished by the increasing demands of
the truFt*. by unsound and reprehensible meth
ods which have misled the people, swindled
thf m and robbed them of their savings.
All classes of the community are being made
to feel the evil influence of the unrestrained
treed and lawless practices of the trusts.
The committee is directed to inform
the House fully on the trust situation,
to the end that more effective laws
may be prepared and passed by Con
gress regulating and restricting com
binations. The committee is empow
ered to send for persons and papers. An
additional resolution states "that It Is
the sense of this House and it does rec
ommend that the laws already existing
against the trusts be in the meanwhile
enforced by the executive branch of
this -Government and the legal repre
sentatives thereof."
The resolutions -were referred to the
Committee on Rules.

WHITE RIBBON
IS PROMINENT
When the Senate convened to-day]
Senator Foraker was approached by
the opponents of General Wood. It was
admitted then that the contest against
confirmation was lost and there was
nothing to be gained by carrying the i
case over to-day. An agreement there- ;
fore was reached whereby no more
speeches were to be made.
Dependent on ,the confirmation of
General Wood w"ere 167 promotions for
other army officers. These have been
held up since the nominations were
made by the President, but now will be
confirmed without opposition. They
include twenty colonels promoted to be
brigadier generals on the retired list
and one brigadier general on the active
list, and officers ranking from colonel
down to second lieutenant. .. All these
nominations, as well as that of Gen
eral Wood, were sent to the Senate at
the beginning of the special session in
November and lapsed when that ses
sion closed. They were sent to the Sen
ate immediately at the beginning of the
regular session.
A controversy arose as to whether
they were reappointments, and also as
to whether the promoted officers were
entitled to the rank and pay of the
grade to which they were nominated.
As all no doubt will be speedily con
firmed,' according to military authority,'
they will take rank and pay from the
time they were first appointed to fill
i vacancies. Â»
Senator Foraker moved to make the
vote public, and Senator Blackburn
moved to make public the testimony
had before the Committee on Military
Affairs. Publishing of the testimony
was voted down, and a general under
standing prevailed that the vote was to
be given out. v

Five Democratic Senators voted, with
the majority in favor ; of > confirmation.
They were Senators Cockrell and Pet
tus, members of the Military Affairs
Committee. ,and Senators Patterson,
Clarke of A^kansas\ and Dubois. The
negative vote on confirmation was as
follows: \ . . , "
WASHINGTON, March 18.â General
Leonard Wood was to-day confirmed to
be a major general by the Senate, the
vote being 45 to 16. The rank dates
from August S, 1903, the day President
Roosevelt made the promotion. The
contest against his confirmation began
on November 19, 1903, soon after Con
gress convened in special session, and
continued through the present session
until to-day.
When death removed Senator Hanna
from the opposers of General Wood
only two Republicans remained in the
minority. They were Senators Scott, a
member of the Military Affairs Com
mittee, who opposed the nomination
while It w'as pending in committee, and
Senator Kittridge.

Business failures in the United States
were 203, against 200 last week and 194
in 1903. In Canada failures for the
week number 17, against 27 last week
and 14 in this week a year ago.
Weather conditions are unfavorable
to the lumber trade at leading Eastern
markets, but prices are firm.
Wheat (including flour) exports for
the week ended March 17 aggregate
2,606,124 bushels, against 1,834,632 bush
els last week and 2,395,598 bushels in
this week last year.
The demand for woolen goods from
manufacturers' agents is reported dis
appointing, and wool sells more freely.
The backwardness of spring trade,
generally attributed to the almost un
interrupted bad Weather, tinges most
reports from distributive centers, but
several developments of the week have
been notably favorable. Chief among
these might be mentioned the arrival of
much-needed moisture, in the critically
situated Southwestern wheat belt, the
continued improvement in the iron and
steel trade and the decision of the
bituminous coal miners not to strike
against proposed reductions of wages.
Liquidation in the cereal markets and
In cotton, accompanied by sharp price
breaks, is also generally construed as
allowing of improvement of the actual
consumptive demand. The railway sit
uation shows a gain.
The recent heavy rains on the Pacific
Coast, while damaging because of large
areas inundated in the San Joaquin and
Sacramento valleys, have done much
good in California as a whole.
The improvement noted in iron and
steel has progressed still further.
Rather more unrest is, noted in the
general industrial situation, but the
only actual outbreaks are those of the
building labprers at New York and of
lithographers. Those strikes, if con
tinued, are expected to injure the gen
eral building situation at New York
and injure the paper trade throughout
the country.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
NEW YORK, March 18.â R. G. Dun
& Co. will say. to-morrow:
The improvement in trade and indus
try continues, the favorable reports
largely outnumbering the adverse in
fluences. The most important event of
the week was the two-thirds vote by
the bituminous coal miners to accept
the proposed reduction in wages. This
will probably prevent a serious struggle
that would paralyze manufacturing
Just when it is beginning to revive.
- Complications have arisen In the local
building, trades that retard structural
work, but a settlement is anticipated,
and the open, weather is stimulating
outdoor work at other points. Distri
bution of Easter goods steadily expands
and. dealers' stocks are being depleted
because of conservatism In purchases.
This promises large supplementary job
bing and wholesale orders as the sea
son advances. Railway earnings thus
far available, for Maroh show a de
crease of only .8 per cent as compared
with last year's figures. ,
Another ' Week has brought ne' check
to the progress in the Iron and steel in
dustry. Increased strength and activ
ity are noted in the hide market, which
is significant at this time, when the
quality Is least satisfactory.
Failures, this week number 229 in the
United States, compared with 220 last
year, and 21 in Canada, against 22 a
year ago. .
â¢ I am extremely disgusted and annoyed at the
statement made with reference to my remarks
at the banquet last night. 1 had been invited
to attend and to speak at the Irish Fellowship
Club in f celebration of St. Patrick's day and
had accepted the Invitation, uut requested thar
I would not be called upon for a speech. I
had understood that I would not be afked to
respond to" any stated toast and had therefore
gone to the banquet without any preparation
to talk on any subject.
After arriving I found that they had as
signed me to respond to the toast, "The Pres
ident Of the United States," and when L arose
I attempted to give an excuse for not talking
on the subject. My excuses were that I was
not permitted by the regulations to discuss the
President or other civil officers, and reminded
them of the disaster that had befallen some
officers who had come from the Philippines.
Another wits -that I did not know anythrng
about the Presidency, meaning thereby that I
had not studied up the usual platitudes given
to the office, and third, that I was no orator.
I am .particularly chagrined at the way the
report Is published In the papers, which would
draw the inference. that I referred to the pres
ent President, for whom I . have the warmest
admiration and with whom I have had a moÂ«t
agreeable personal acquaintance. His kind and
thoughtful consideration upon the occasion of
thie death and burial of my mother has given
, me a personal attachment for him which will
| never grow less, and anything that would be
eaid to indicate that I was not his warmest
and most devoted admirer would do a wrong
! to my personal feeling for the present chief
I magistrate O f t h e United States.
CHICAGO, March ' 18.â "Presidency
and President are distinct terms," said
General Fred D. Grant to-day when
asked if he had been correctly under
stood when It was reported of him that
he declined to toast the President of
the United States at the St. Patrick's
day banquet of the Irish Fellowship
Club. The general gave the following
signed statement:
The old Holden School building was
erected at a cost . of $50,000. The
new structure cost more 'than $100,
000. The new building was damaged
by water.
All the Injured firemen were on the
third floor of the burning structure
when the roof fell jn upon them. The
fire started on the third floor and by
the time the first engines arrived the
entire upper part of the building was
in flames. It was feared the fire would
spread to the new school building ad
joining, which is twice the size of the
burned structure, but by hard work
the flames were confined to the upper
floors.

three hours to-day, .an. eanly adjourn
ment being taken to permit members to
make a trip to the site of the pro
posed Jamestown Exposition. Al
though the postoffice appropriation bill,
was under discussion the entire time,
only one page was completed, making
eleven pages in all disposed of. Sev
eral amendments were adopted, the
principal one being the Insertion of a
new paragraph in the bill providing for
an appropriation of $500,000 for' "un
usual business" at third and fourth
class postoffices. The Postmaster Gen
eral is required to make public the
regulations under which the allotments
are to be made before using any part
of this amount and a similar require

expenditure of the $1,000,000 for separ

Following a line of questions asked
by Chairman Hepburn regarding the
selection of the canal route recom
mended by the commission, Admiral
Walker explained that the law required
the commission to select the route most
feasible and economical which the
I.'nited States could own and operate.
Nicaragua was selected first because
J109.003.000 was asked for the Panama
concession by the French company,
â¢which put that route entirely out of the
question as compared with Nicaragua.
\\ hen the price was reduced to $40,000.
000 and title assured the conditions
were changed and the commission re
jxr.rted in favor of the Panama route.
The hearings will be continued on Mon
day.
Admiral Walker made a detailed de
scription of the methods of expending
money by the last canal commission.
of which he was president. He said
that President MeKinley had delegated
him as the executive head of the com
ir.ifMon. and when the commission or
panized the entire supervision of the
expenditure of money was left in his
hands.
Secretary Taft was also questioned
by members of the committee regarding
his views as to the proposed methods
of expending the money for the con
struction of the canal. He said the
Pr'-fid^nt undoubtedly had made the
j.roper delegation of his authority on

fatally injuring an artillery officer,
Major Papin, and seriously wounding
half a dozen other persons. When the
machine was discovered Major Papin

package in which the machine was
concealed, the explosion occurred. Pa
pin's legs were blown off arid he short
ly afterward died. "A policeman who
also lost his legs by the explosion is
in a precarious condition. Thousands
of windows were shattered. ' There is
no clewto the perpetrators of the out

PANIC ON' 'CHANGE.
News of Sully's Failure Causes New
Orleans Brokers Uneasiness.
; NEW ORLEANS, March IS.â The
Â¦ announcement of the failure of Dan : el
Sully & Co. created a panic to-day on
the floor of the New Orleans Cotton
Exchange. Prices melted away until
they were ?9 and 510 a bale lower
than yesterday's close. When the
panic was over the comrnercial in
tegrity of the local- cotton trade was
found intact, although scores of small
operators were wiped out and heavy
longs had lost fortunes. Prices
tumbled 10 and 20 points at a time
and still the selling continued. CoatÂ»
were torn, hats smashed, chairs and
stools about the ring were demolished.
So great was the roar from the ring
that it could be heard for blocks. The
ring had the appearance of being the
object of an attack of about 200 men.
Mho plunged over ope another to get
nearer the small pit that is In the
center of it. It was not until the
brokers found their books well clear
of long cotton that they paused and
allowed the tumult to subs<de.
At 1:30 o'clock the panicky feeling
has passed to some extent and brokers
were unable to extricate themselves
from the ring and find out Just what
thÂ« situation was. They found prices
$9 and $10 a bale lower than yester
day's closing.
When it was found that no local
firm was embarrassed by the failure
prices showed a wonderful recovery.
At the close the tone was steady and
May showed a recovery of 13 points,
while July had recovered 29 points.
KING OF COTTON' MARKET WHOSE
l"XEXPECTED SUSPENSION IS
I THE TAT.K OF THE WORLD.
Fagan, manager of the firm's New
Orleans office, was taken into the firm.
will be given out from this office to
day. Possibly a statement will be ready
early Saturday morning."
Hadley later was quoted as saying
that the firm would pay its debts in
full and the suspension was due to
the impossibility of meeting demands
for large sums of money due to the
Sully firm from European sources, sums
that the quick slump ln the market
made payable too Quick for them to be
able to meet.
Sully left his office at 4 o'clock
All sorts of explanations were mad?
for the suspension. One of the reasons
given was that the New Orleans bull
party had sold cotton while Sully was
bulling it In the confidence that they
were supporting him. Another was
that Sully's following in the market
had sold their long cotton without ad
vising with him.
HINT OF TREACHERY.
' From two well informed sources
came a denial that there was any
treachery from New Orleans. A cotton
operator with New Orleans connections
said that the bull party there was still
bullish in cotton.
Another account that came from one
of the six or seven best known cotton
operators in this country was that the
bear party had made a deliberate and
well-planned attack to overwhelm
Sully and had succeeded. The bears,
according to this authority, had
figured out the weakness of Sully's po
sition, due to immense holdings of spot
and contract cotton and to his opera
tions on the Liverpool market, and
planned an attack on the market that
would carry it down Just far enough
to make It Impossible for Sully to meet
his margin calls, knowing that his
failure would send the market so much
lower thst they could cover at figures
to recoup them.
No definite idea of Sully's commit
ments in the cotton market could be
obtained from other houses In the cot
ton market. One estimate was that
he was "long" 300,000 bales of May cot
ton alone.
A good authority safd that he did not
believe Sully was "long" more than
that in the whole market, and a con
servative estimate made ln another
source was 600.000 bales. The losses by
Sully's failure, in case" he cannot settle,
it was said, will be divided among
nearly all the brokers on the exchange.
One estimate was that Sully's ownings
after a settlement under the rule of the
exchange would not exced $500,000.
What Sully has personally lost or what
his backers hare lost in market opera
tions Is not included in this figure.
HIS SUDDEN RISE.
In . Stock Exchange circles the fail
ure of Sully was at first taken as a
sure sign of the collapse of the cot
ton boom. Later there was some ap
prehension lest the failure might
bring down a string of banking insti
tutions in the South.
Daniel J. Sully became a factor In
the cotton market In January, 1903,
when he took fan the bull movement
that Theodore H. Price h*ad dropped.
He was thought to have done a great
thing when he bulled May cotton of
1903 to 10 cents. He had been a cot
ton buyer for New England firms. He
had made a study of crop conditions
and foresaw the short er*Â»r> of that
year as well as the short crop of this
season. It was said that a clique of
New England mill-owners backed him
in his first venture. His May cam
paign was'a success and it was esti
mated that he personally cleared
more than $1. 000, 000. '
He established a cotton house of
his own last year under the name of
Daniel J. Sully & Co.. but when his
operation in cotton became so suc
cessful, the cotton market having
been pushed up above 17 cents a
pound early this year, he widened the
scope of his firm's business, bought
a seat on the New York Stock Ex
change, went into the office business,
bought a membership on the Chicago
Board of Trade and. it was said.- made
connections with other promlnentex
changes throughout the country.
The members of the firm were

Special Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO. March 18.â Although
there were no important developments
In the labor situation to-day it seemed
to be agreed on all sides that the situa
tion is serious and that there is no im
mediate prospect of a settlement. The
tie-up In the building trades is â¢prac
tically complete and the declaration of
the Citizens' Alliance and the Building
and Contractors' associations for an
open shop town is regarded' as plainly
defining the issue against unionism.
Much speculation is indulged in as to
whether unions outside of those con
nected with the building trades will
take up the fight, but it is thought Dy
union men that the issue will be con
fined to the building trades alone.
Meanwhlle.the Building Trades Council
announces that its members are pre
pared to do work for citizens on houses
from roof to cellar, and it is claimed
that they are securing all the materials
they need from outside sources. In
deed, while the local supply houses are
under agreement not to furnish ma
terials to others than employers con
nected with the Builders' Association,
the locked-out artisans appear able to
secure materials from several houses.
This afternoon J. M. James, a builder
not connected with the Builders' Asso
ciation, filed a petition with Attorney
General "Webb asking his permission to
sue in the name of the State the Build
ers' Association of Sacramento on the
ground that it has enteredinto a con
spiracy to prevent contractors outside
that association from carrying on.thtir
business.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SALEM, Ore., March 18.â Horace
Holden a resident of Tillamook City
for the past sixty years, and one of
the most highly respected pioneers of
Oregon, was laid to rest in the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery this afternoon. The
deceased was 94 years old when he died
in Tillamook City last Monday morn
ing, and during that time he had ex
periences that would fill volumes more
interesting and startling than the yel
lowest of the yellow back novels. ..
Horace Holden was- born in Hills
boro, Vt., July 21, 1S10, his parents be
ing farmers of moderate means. The
father died when the son was a mere
boy, leaving the lad to support a fam
ily of children. He struggled with the
problem manfully until, at the age of
21 years, his health failed him and he
decided to go to sea, signing as a sailor
on the ship Mentor, and began a voy
age to the IrwUan Ocean. The ship's
company consisted of twenty-two men
when the voyage began at New .Bed
ford, Mass., and the vessel crossed the
Atlantic to the Azores, rounded Cape
of Good Hope, and cruised in the Indian
Ocean for many weeks. Later the ship
entered the Pacific Ocean, was over
taken in a terrific storm and became a
wreck on a coral reef near the Pelew
group of islands. Eleven of the men
were drowned in the terrific seas that
swept the doomed vessel, the remain
ing eleven reaching a place of safety
on the reef after herculean struggles in
the waves.
When escaping from the ship the
crew only carried away one small
chest of ship's biscuits, a keg of water,
some clothing, a can of gunpowder, a
musket and a brace of pistols, together
with a tinder box and a pair of cut
lasses. They spent a night on the cliff
and on the following morning, the
storm having .subsided, they were much
refreshed and ready to battle for their
lives. Scarce had the day come, how
ever, when new dangers beset them.
CAPTURED BY CANNIBALS.
Canoes filled with naked men, armed
with battle axes and spears, ap
proached them. There was no way of
escape and the men were taken cap
tives and conveyed to an island thirty
miles away, but when nearlng the is
lands the prisoners suddenly made a
dash for liberty and escaped by su
perior skill in handling their boat.
Taking to the open sea after twenty
four hours of hard work the wretched
sailors again approached land and
were rewarded by finding a good land
ing. But scarce had they set foot on
shore when they were again captured
by natives and taken to the largest is
land in the group.
The natives seemed to be disposed
to put their prisoners to death, but
just as the poor captives were to be
executed and put In the pot a man
clad ln native attire, but with' the fea
tures and hair of an Englishman, came
upon the scene and saved them from
death. They were given a hearing be
fore the chiefs, and the natives, after
consulting their prophetess, decided to
let their captives live. Their deliverer
proved to be an English sailor who
had been set ashore by his ship and
abandoned, and who had made a name
among the cannibals. j
The prisoners were well treated for
a time, but the food Bupply ran out
and they were placed in old canoes
and told to leave the island, which was
done. But disappointment was again
their portion, for they landed on an
other island, where they once more be
came prisoners of a savage tribe.
The prisoners were separated and
dragged about from place to place.
Holden finally fell into the hands of
a native who* was more humane than
his friends, and he often spoke of
Pahrahbooa, his erstwhile lord, who
called the prisoner by the name of
Teemit.
THREE OF CREW KILLED.
The Island on which they were was
known to navigators as Lord North's
Island. They were .the first white men
to land on the" Island, which was sup
posed to be uninhabited, and they found
no means of escape. Three of the men
After Being Shipwrecked
He Falls Into Hands of
Cannibals Several Times
Labor Situation Unchanged
and There Is No Prospect
of Immediate Settlement
NEW YORK. March 17. â Daniel
J. Sully, who has for fifteen months
been the largest figure in the cotton
markets of the world and who has
"bulled" cotton from 7 cents a pound
to 17 c^nts, to-day announced his
inability to make good his engage
ments on the New York Cotton Ex
change. Within a few moments cot
ton fell nearly 513 a bale from the
highest figures of the " day. Many
crashes have been recorded, but prob
ably none has been accompanied by
such frenzy and confusion. While
there had been no premonition of the
impending crash, no morning of the
season had witnessed a more demor
alized market. In less than three
minutes after the opening half a cent
had been taken off the price of cot
ton. The prices went up and down
10. -^ and 20 points within two and
tl~ee minutes. May opened at 15.25c
and sold down to 14.75c in less than
fifteen minutes, while July, opening
at 15.22c. went down to 14.86c.
Toward the end of the first half hour
early sellers started to cover and
there was a ra;-id advance. There
was nothing in the news to account
for the excitement. It seemed merely
a renewal of bear operations and the
clinching of further stop orders.
Shortly after the afternoon session
there was a lull in the pit and at
about 2:05 o'clock the announcement
of the suspension was made by Su
perintendent King, who read from the
rostrum this notice:
"We regret that we are unable to
meet our engagements and will there
fore have to suspend.
"DANIEL J. SULLY & CO."
BROKERS ARE FRAXTIC.
For a few seconds there was quiet
over the floor. Then with one impulse
a mighty shout went up from the bears
who had been flehtins Sully and the
bull clique for months. Hats were
thrown into the air to be trampled
upon in th? stampede for the pit. Coats
were torn by frantic brokers and chairs
end camp stools were dashed into the
pit. Messengers soon were rushing in
e.nd out of the building with orders it
se!l or buy. Telephone booths were
besieged and telegraph offices were
flooded with dispatches.
Outside the Cotton Exchange ap
pearances gave little indication of the
pandemonium within until the mes
sengers began to rush between the ex
change and the brokers' offices. Soon
the news reached the Stock and Pro
duce and Coffee exchanges and th c
traders on these markets hastened to
6ee the panic. But a double guard was
placed at the doors and ' admittance
â¢was refused to any but those accom
panied by members.
It was estimated that something like
750.000 bales of cotton were traded in
during the twenty minutes of panic
that followed the announcement and
that of this upward of 500,000 bales
represented "forced liquidation." or the
selling out of men whose margins have
been nearly or quite wiped out. As
the market slumped 2S0 points during
this period the loss falling on this ele
ment amounted to something more
than $1,000,000.
The market steadied after about
twenty minutes and then there was a
eudden upward shoot of about 100
points. This sharp upward rise was
brought about by the buying of brokers
and speculators, who saw that the mar
ket had slumped too far and would
react. A part nf the. excitement on the
floor o^the exchange was caused by
the scramble of brokers who wanted
Just such bargains and had to fight to
get in the ring to get them. The buy
ing rush was almost as exciting and
just as noisy as the selling panic.
STOCKS TAKE DROP.
"No statement of any kind or de
scription, Mr. Sully directs me to say.
Tb<? announcement of Sully's suspen
sion tvas put on the tickers everywhere
Â¦within a few moments after it was
roade, and there was somewhat of a
flurry on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange after the news reached
there. Sully is a member of that ex
change, having purchased a seat two
or three months ago. Stocks went off
from half a point to a point and a
half on the fear that the failure might
bring a rush of stock selling. The
weakness was only momentary, for
Â¦word was passed around that Sully
had net been trading in stocks and that
the clearing-house sheets had never
Fhoan a single transaction by him.
The market was reassured and stocks
went up again.
Fully shut himself up in his office
and refused to publish a statement.

The case of Alexander B. Oarnett.
charged with the murder of Major J.
W. McClung In the rooms of Mra.
Elizabeth Hitchcock-Coit in the Pal
ace Hotel on November 25, Is sst for
trial in Judge Lawlor's court on Mon
day, but it is doubtful if the trial will
proceed at that time.
Attorney W. D. Grady, on behalf of
the defendant, filed a motion in court
yesterday for the appointment of a
commission to take the evidence of
Dr. A. H. Garnett. Colorado Spring.
Colo., defendant's brother, and the
Judge continued the matter until 9
o'clock Monday morntnpr.
Grady said that a cablegram had
been received from Mrs. Coit from
Paris, France, to the effect that she
would be ready at any time to give
her testimony to a commissioner ap
pointed by thfl court and he suggested
that the court should appoint a com
mission. The Judge had already ru!eÂ«l
against appointing a commission, but
said he might reconsider the matter
on Monday morning.
Grady also remarked that Mrs. Mc-
Clung was at present in San Diego ami
the Judge asked if she had been mib
penaed as a witness at the trial.
Grady replied in the regative and the
Judge advised L'm to do so at once.
I waÂ» surprised to notice how fast the cur
rents In the tidal canal have worn away the
north-side bank that divides the canal from
the diverting ditch. It was originally In
tended to riorap the banks of the canal to
prevent thÂ«m from caving and making the
channel shallow. It appvars now that if this
Is not done soon to the north-side bank at
least between Fruitvale avenue and HUh
street, the narrow strip of earth separat
ing the tidal canal from the south wall of
the diverting ditch will be washed entirely
away, leaving nothing to separate the two
but th<5 unsupported plankingr and piling
W Ith no dike to support the south wall o*
the diverting ditch the latter would be almont
worthies*. If thÂ« hanks of the tidal canal
were rlprapped as they should be the divert
ing ditch would continue to answer the pur
pose for which It was planned, to carry the
slickens of Sausal Creek to the flats of San
Leandro Bay. As matters are a break Is
liable to occur In the diverting ditch and the
debris will then flew directly Into the tidal
canal. "-:
and permit the great volume of storm
slickens that are now coming down
Sausal Creek to flow directly into the
tidal canal and fill up that channel,
upon which the United States Govern
ment expended nearly a million dollars
as a part of the Oakland Harbor Im
provement project. At present the di
verting ditch conveys the Sausal Creek
debris Into San Leandro Bay, spread
ing it over the flats south of Melrose.
Between Frultvale and High street
there are four places where the levee
against the south wall of the divert
ing ditch has fallen away, exposing the
planking and piling to the action of
the tides in the canal. The first of
these landslides is about eight hundred
feet west of Fruitvale avenue and Is
fifty feet wide. There are a number of
leaks in the bottom of the ditch at that
point and through these the water of
Sausal Creek is making Its way Into
the tidal canal and undermining the
ditch bottom. There is another large
slide midway between Fruitvale ave
nue and High street and two other
smaller ones. In some places the south
wall of the diverting ditch is the only
partition between that channel and the
tidal canal. Sausal Creek ia now higher
than It has been for many seasons and
a great body of water and slickens is
coming down from the hills north of
Fruitvale.
The diverting ditch cost the United
States Government $55,000 to construct
and should the bottom fall out of it in
any place It will be worthless as a
part of the Oakland Harbor project.
City Engineer William R. Poyser,
who has taken a close interest in the
tidal canal since work was first com
menced on the s big waterway, nearly
twenty years ago, has closely observed
the action of the tides on the banks of
the channel and of the flood running
through the diverting ditch. With ref
erence to them he said:
GARXETT MURDER TRIAL.
SET FOR MONDAY NEXT
The action involved the title to the
property known as the Sessions Basin,
upon which the plaintiff has expended
570,000.
Sessions claimed that he had a con
tract with H. W. Carpentier to buy the
land and he did take possession of It
and expended money for improvements.
He, however, failed to make the final
payment of $50,000, which became due
In 1S97, and only made a tender of the
money in 1901. After putting In his
side of the case, attorneys for De
Fremery made a motion for a nonsuit
upon the ground that he had failed to
show that he had perfected his title.
Two days were consumed in the argu
ment. When it was finished this aft
ernoon Judge Hall decided In favor of
the defendant and granted Its motion,
tlon.
A suit over property valued at $150,
000 was decided against C. E. Sessions
this afternoon by Judge Hall and in
favor of the Oakland Harbor Develop
ment Company, of which James L.. de
Fremery is president and principal
stockholder. De Fremery stated In
court that he owned twelve-fourteenths
of the stock of the corporation.

C. E. Sessions in Action
Over Valuable Property
The best man seems to be the whole
thing and his office is akin to the Chris
tian minister's. First he introduces the
bride and groom and then serves them
and himself with cups of sake. Three
drops of it are poured into three dif
ferent crescent shaped vessels, which
graduate in size. Each of the trio
drinks from each of these cups. This
ceremony is called ean san kudo.
In the meantime the wedding party
la regaled with a sort of low chant
ing, in which the best man and the
guests in the other room participate.
Afterward they eat dried wsh, and the
nex't day the friends of the bridal party
come with presents and sit down to a
great. feast.
These rites were all observed in the
wedding of Miss Toshi and Mr. Ma
klno at midnight last Sunday in the
groom's little home at 1546 Dwight way.
All the way from Tokio t<r Berkeley
came Miss Makai Toshi, a Japanese
maiden of comely mien and picturesque
gowns, to marry Saklo Maklno, a pros
perous florist. They were married last
Sunday night, the day after her ar
rival on the Siberia from the Orient,
and thereby hangs a tale of a strange
wedding - ceremony, estimated from
Christian standards, and a pretty chap
eron with a touch of romance in her
story. j .
Now Miss .Toshi did not travel alone.
She is the daughter of a coal merchant
at Shizuoka, a town a hundred miles
from Tokio, and her people know some
thing of the demands of American so
ciety. They found a chaperon In Ma
dame Fumi Agata, whose husband is
Frank Agata, a student at the Univer
sity of California, and from whom she
has been separated since their mar
riage seven years ago.
The Japanese wedding rites are per
formed at dead of night. Bride and
groom enter the room from different
doors. The apartment is dimly lighted
and none but the best man is permit
ted there with the enchanted couple,
for fear of the groom marrying the
wrong girl in the dark.

The part of the jail that communi
cates directly with this basement is
the kitchen, where six or eight pris
oners are employed, and it is believed
that while some were making a show
of working one of their number was
busy burrowing in the wall. The door
has been double locked and barred un
til Rome other means can be devised
to strengthen this part of the building.
The peculiar part of the affair is that
it cannot be ascertained which of the
prisoners are guilty, but it is belie\'ed
that a number were in the' plot. Im
mediately under the jail office is a
basement that has never been occupied.
There is a small iron door leading into
this basement that is always locked,
but in some manner the prisoners pro
cured a key to the door and, choosing
a dark corner of the wall, started to
dig for freedom.
A bold attempt of prisoners to cut
their way through the walls of the
County Jail was discovered to-day
through the vigilance of the deputies
under Sheriff Bishop and that part of
the building in which they operated
is now barred with heavy locks until
the damage can be repaired. With a
little more enlarging and a kick- the
outside row of bricks in the heavy wall
would have gone out and left a breach
large enough for a man to crawl
through.

The company paid taxes amounting
to about 5100 under protest and has
brought suit to recover the money. The
District AttQjjiey to-day filed his de
murrer to tl.e complaint, which was
overruled by the Judge.
It Is the opinion Â« ' District Attor
ney All^n that the franchise of the
Western Union Telegraph Company Js
exempt from taxation, and while he is
maintaining 'a suit against the com
pany for the retention of the taxes col
lected upon an assessment by Henry
P. Dalton a decision of the Supreme
Court directly against the position he
has 'aken In tl.e matter has forced him
to the conclusl .n that this franchise
is exempted by the Federal Govern
ment.
"In this connection," he said, "I have
found a decision in the 96 Califonia
Reports which states that by reason of
the fact that the Gevernment has given
the "Western Un!-n a franchise over its
public Iiighways the company In re
turn gives Government messages pri
ority over any other business. By this
means the Government carries out part
of its powers of sovereignty. The rates
are fixed by the Postmaster General,
and it states directly that no State has
the right to tax this franchise and
that such an act is null and void. In
the face of this decision flat against
me, I do net see what I can do."

A ton of manure will not help a plant

You cannot cure dandruff and baldness

Edward S. Sproat of the bankrupt
grocery firm of Sproat Bros, was ar
rested last Thursday by United States
Marshal Shine on an attachment issued
by United States District Judge de
Haven for having failed to file his j
schedule of assets and liabilities. He j
will be taken before Judge de Haven j
at 10 o'clock this morning to show j
cause why he failed to comply with
the requirements of the bankruptcy
law. Joseph C. Campbell, Sproat's at
torney, gave his personal assurance to
Marshal Shine that his client would I
appear to-day in pursuance of the pro
cess Issued by the court.
Attaching the body of an involun
tary bankrupt for failing to file a
schedule is a very .unusual proceed- 1!
ing, and this appears to be the first
time that such a process has been is
sued in this State. The creditors are-j
very anxious Â«o ascertain the where- j
abouts and extent of Sproat's assets, I
and for that purpose they took advan- [
tage of a clause in the bankruptcy act j
to have an attachment issued for his ;
arrest so that he might be compelled
to answer in court as to his assets. . ;
There are proceedings pending j
against Sproat in the Superior Court j
and he has been already indicted by i
the City and County Grand Jury for .
attempting to defraud his creditors. !
The following application was made to
Judge de Haven last Thursday by
Frank & Mansfield, attorneys for Siebe
Bros. & Plagemann, M. J. Brandenstein j
& Co.. Martin Dangers & Camm and I
F. Hillens, petitioning creditors:
The petitioning creditors In the above en
titled matter respectfully represent:
That on the 3d day of March, 1904, tb.% laid
Edward S. Fproat vae duly adjudged a bank
rupt by this honorable court:
That on the 7th day of March, 1904, said
bankrupt fas served with notice to file a
schedule oT his creditors and of his property, j
as required by section 7, subdivision S of the >
acts of Congress relating to bankruptcy:
That said bankrupt has failed to comply |
with the said notice and, has failed to furnish!
a schedule of his creditors and property. That i
more than ten (10) days have elapsed since j
the date of said adjudication in bankruptcy.
Wherefore, said petitioning creditors make I
application to this honorable court for an. at- }
tachment against said Edward S. Sproat. and
that said Edward S. Pproat be brought before
this court to ehow cause why he should not
be punished for contempt for failure to file j
such schedules. :
Dated. March 17th, 1904. '
In accordance with the foregoing ap
plication Judge de Haven issued the
order for the arrest.

A friend of Eugene Wanderer pur
chased a lottery ticket and won a wad
of money, and when Eugene heard of
the occurrence he allowed it to monopo
lize his mind, so on St. Patrick's day
he did rot realize that the heavens
were weeping until Policemen Doherty
and Jewell called his attention to that
fact and demanded to know what he
meant by aimlessly wandering in the
Â¦net. His answer being unsatisfactory,
the officers searched bis sodden cloth
ing and In one of the pockets found two
tickets issued by a Mexican lottery.
Then they arrested him for having the
lilc-pal coupons in his possession.
"It is true. Judge," pleaded Mr. Wan
derer, "that I did not have sense
enough to get out of the rain, for my
mind was completely absorbed by the
good luck of my friend. Nor do I re
member buying the lottery tickets that
these officers have produced in evidence
against me. If I took any drinks â the
officers declare I had been drinking
when they found me â I have no recol
lection of having done bo."
"A most extraordinary case of mental
aberration." commented the Judge,'
'and as this is ycur first introduction
to roe. and rou seem to have done
nothing more reprcscnEible than to
make an animated sponge of yourself,
I'm Inclined to let you go, provided you
promise that never again shall the in
ridlous blandishments of the fickle pod
?iees be permitted to keep you out in
the rain when you have no umbrella."
Mr. Wanderer promised and respect
fully withdrew.
Police treatment of hopeless victims ;
of the opium habit was then taken up j
ard logically discussed by Judge Mo
gan, his remarks being addressed di
rf-ctly to Officer Hicks, but apparently
aimed at the force as a whole.
Robert Lane, a most pitiable locrk
inp "dope" fiend, had been arrested
v. h:!e he was loitering in the vicinity
at a Kearny-street drug store that
makes a specialty of Belling opium. He
was not doing anything particularly
harmful â just loitering â when OiTlcer
Hicks took him in and booked him
for vagrancy. A few days aero a s=im
lliur charge against him was dismissed
by Judge Fritz, who then expressed the
opinion that it v.-as useless to send such
a human wreck to jail, and it was
evident that Judse Mogan did not ad
mire the police enterprise that resulted
in having the derelict placed before
him.
"This man â or remains of a man â
should have been sent back to his
haunts In Chinatown instead of being
brought here." said the Judge to the
policeman. "He is a hopeless slave to
the opium habit, and opium is all he
cares for. Imprisonment cannot have
cither runitive or reformatory effect on
him. and to imprison him is absolutely
useless. So long as their only offense
i? that of existing, he and his kind
should be kept within the confines of
Chinatown, where their appearance
â¢iocs not shock nor their presence con
taminate. Take this creature back to
Chinatown, and see to it that he is re
turned there every time he crosses the
boundary. Do not bring him here again
until he commits wme offense more se
rioiis than that of living out his mis
erable life."
Tbe tottering, wild-eyed wretch was
led away.
Mfltcn Rice, stalwart of framÂ« and
aggressive cf manner, was before Judge
Mogan on a charge of .peddling with
out a licer.se, and in defense of his
misdemeanor he airily pleaded inability
to procure enough money to purchase
the requisite permit. He came from
the East about a menth ago, he added,
end adopted peddling as an honest
r.eacf of earning a livelihood.
"And an easy means as well." said
the Judge, eurveying with critical eye
the herculean physical proportions of
llr. Rice- "With your physique and
forwardness cf manner you should be
able to obtain employment at any kind
cÂ»f unskilled labor, but evidently you
are not yearning for hard work. Ped
dling is a business better suited for
the aged and infirm than for such a
giant as you. Mr. Rice, and I would
advis* you to turn your muscular hand
to some other vocation until you have
earned sufficient money to peddle â if
rÂ«3dle you must â in a legal manner.
I'll remand you for one week, and if
you are not accompanied by a ped
dler's license when next you appear
before me I'll fine you $10 for peddling
without cne."
Mr. Rice's demeanor was less arro
gant as he vent forth to "hustle."
In defense of their conduct Murphy
and Buckley pleaded that they are au
thorized to capture any dog and ex
amine it to ascertain if it is properly
tagged, but Judge Fritz contested that
pica, stating that they should exercise
discretion in their overhauling canines.
Folic* Judg-e Fritz fcund Deputy
Pourzdkeepers Arthur Murphy and
Charles Buckley guilty of cruelty to
animals ar.d severely censured their
official stupidity cr arrogance that led
to their arrest on complaint of Cap
tain W. S. Overton of the Coast Ar
tillery, whese St. Bernard dog j they
".::?;ed upon seizing despite the fact
;ha: a license tag was attached to the
. ;u.Tal's collar. They will be sentenced
j. xt Wednesday.
Captain Overton and his wife were
<!rivisg along Van Ness avenue one
day last week, their St. Bernard trot
t'.ng behind the buggy, when Murphy
and Buckley tried to net the dog. ignor
ir.jr its owr.ers' assurance that it was
duly licensed to run at large. To save
the animal from threatened injury
'"aptain Overton lifted it into the
but the pounamen continued
â¢^winging- th*ir net, striking and maim
:r.g the dop and narrowly missing Mrs.
<"'vertos. Then the tag on the dog's
collar was exhibited to them, and they
desisted. This statement of Captain
and Mrs. Overton was corroborated by
Mrs. Morgan, who witnessed the occur
rence from the sidewalk.
Policeman Earle stated that ever
Fince the beginning of January he had
been attracting Mrs. Peyser's attention
to the necessity of having "The Octa
via" supplied with fire escapes, but she
had ignored his reminders and he found
it necessary to arrest her to prove that
he meant business.
"It seems to me," remarked the
Judge, "that if I were managing a
boarding-house I would be as eager as
any policeman to have my boarders
provided" with all arailable, facilities
for escape in the event of flre. And if
the owner of the premises declined to
pay for guch facilities, I think I would
pay for them myself and then deduct
their cost from the rent."
After some further discussion of the
Mrs. Annie Peyser, landlady of "The
Octavia." an apartment-house at 1423
Octavia" street, protested to Judge
Mosan that it was not her duty to
equip that structure with fire escapes,
and complained that Policeman A. S.
Earle had overstepped his duty when
he arrested her for neglecting to com
ply with his oft-repeated request that
she provide some means of escape for
her boarders in the event of nocturnal
conflagration and impossibility of them
finding egress via the ordinary routes.
She Â»aid, furthermore, that if fire
escapes are necessary the owner of the
building. Architect Kohlberg, should
erect them.
Fred Helbush and Fred Tapley were
accused, before Judge Mogan, of
having perforated with revolver bullets
the cellar walls of Mr. Travers' resi
dence, 110 Second avenue. Richmond
district. The complainant stated that
the safety cf his family was en
dangered, to say nothing of the prop
erty damage effected, by the leaden
missiles fired by the defendants, and
that he desires to have them compelled
to select some other target when they
go out to pistol practice. - â¢:;â¢
No contradiction of the complainant's
charge was entered, the only defense
offered being that the scene of the
shooting is outside the boundary of the
district in which the discharge of fire
arms is prohibited by law. This plea
was takpn under advisement and mean
lime Mr. Travers will amend his com
plaint to malicious mischief," which is
a misdemeanor anywhere within the
boundaries of San Francisco.
Plans and specifications of the frame
building at the southwest corner of
Jackson and Broderick streets were
produced in Mogan's court to show
whether the structure was three in one
or one in three, and at the conclusion
of an exhaustive examination of ex
perts the question remained undecided
and was continued till next Monday,
when more experts will testify.
The inquiry was incidental to the
charge of Health Inspector Mulligan
th?_t the building is three separate and
distinct buildings with only one drain
pipe, whereas it should have three.
George F. Duffy, plumber, alleges, on
the other hand, that the building is only
one building, and that its one drain
pipe meets all the legal requirements.
"I'd like to see you young people
get along amicably," said the Judge,
"for the haby's sake as much as your
own. . I do not want to deprive your
wife and child* of a livelihood, Henry,
and for that reason I will let you go
if you will promise to abstain from
quarreling with her. Do not make such
a promise unless you intend to keep
it, for if you ever come before me again
on this charge, your wife's helplessness
will not be allowed to help you."
The husband gave emphatic assur
ance that he would never again pro
mote domestic discord.
Â¦ a a
Then came John Henry, a pale-faced
young man, charged with having, as-
Fauited his equally young and equally
Eallow-complexioned wife in their home
on Clara street, near Fifth. Policeman
Phillips was the complaining witness
in this case also, and he testified that
.Mr. and Mrs. Phillips frequently dis
turbed their neighbors by quarreling.
A fourteen months old baby crowed
in his wife's arms as she sat in court.
Mrs. Henry hoped her husband would
not be sent to jail, for he was the only
means she had of supporting herself
and baby. He was a clerk and earned
a good salary. She was unable to ex
plain why they did not dwell in har
mony. He might be to blame for the
marital friction and the fault might
be hers. Yes, it was just possible that
both of them were to blame for it.
that he could not extend the maximum
penalty for disturbance of the peace
so as to double the period of incarcera
tion prescribed for her.
The Dunns live on Shipley street, be
tween Fourth and Fifth, and a flock
of neighbors testified that the hus
band is a weak invalid ana the wife
a sturdy termagant. While he was able
to work the man was industrious and
frusral and saved some money, while
the woman was neither an economical
housekeeper nor a cheerful wife. So
when a chronic malady incapacitated
the breadwinner for labor he discreet
ly took charge of the family treasury
and gave the woman such sums as
were needed for current expenses.
She did not relish the restraint thus
r'.aced upon her penchant for extrava
gant expenditure, and constantly de
manded more funds, which demands
were as steadily refused, despite their
attempted enforcement by violence.
The sick man was frequently beaten
until the neighbors rescued him from
the infuriated woman, and It was with
the object of allowing him to end his
numbered days in peace and avert his
probable murder that they finally ap
peaJod to Policeman Phillips to put a
stop to the cruelty. So the policeman
embraced the first opportunity to ar
rest the woman. He caught her in the
act of ferociously beating her spouse
last Thursday.
"I am very sorry." said the court,
"that a charge more serious than that
of disturbing- the peace was not entered
against this defendant, and I regret
that the law does not allow me to sen
tence her to prison for a more extend
ed period than three months. The
lonper she is in jail the better it would
iÂ»e for the helpless victim of her bru
tality â a brutality that makes her a
disgrace to her sex. Take her away,
Mr. Bailiff."
E. A. Belcher, .who has been prom
inent for some years in the councils
of the California Miners' Association,
has written a communication in which
he discusses the subject of ground
sluicing in the light cf the decision of
the Supreme Court of California in
the Kate Hayes case. The decision
was fi!ed last December. Since then
there has been some query, especially
outside of this State, about the effect
upon California. Mr. Belcher says
that some operators have scented dan
ger to the mining industry- .There is
no such dnnger, and to this phase of
the matter Mr. Belcher applies him
self vigorously. A part of his com
munication is given herewith for the
amount of information that it contains
that may not be readily accessible to
many who are interested in mining
pursuits.
"The court," says Mr. Belcher, "did
not extend the doctrine of Woodruff
vs. North Bloomfleld, etc., known as
the 'mining debris case.' and mining
industries conducted on the water
sheds of the Sacramento and San Joa
quln rivers are in no greater danger
now than they were after the filing
of the decree ip the mining debris case.
In the mining debris case the defend
ants were using large heads of water
for mining by the hydraulic process
and discharging their tailings Into the
tributaries of the Sacramento River,
whereby, as the court found, the river
had already become so silted up as
to endanger the fertile, agricultural
lands of the plains, and whereby navi
gation of the river and of San j Pablo
Pay and of San Francisco Bay had
been impeded. In the Kate Hayes case
the defendants were using large heads
of water (25O0 Inches) for mining by
the 'ground sluice process,' by which
as disclosed by the evidence, great
quantities of tailings were carried into
the tributaries of the Yuba River,
where, for the same reasons as those
obtaining in the mining debris case,
they became a continuing menace to.
valuabfe property.
"The court finds that the ground
sluice process (as shown in that case)
'produced the same effect in kind as
the !.; Jlrnulic process, only to a less
degree.' The . gravamen of the action
was, as it must be in every such case,
that material injury had been done and
was being threatened. Mining on the
water sheds of the Sacramento Riverâ
to \7hich the Yuba, Bear, Feather,
American and Mokelumne rivers are
tributary, and upon the water sheds of
the San Joaquin Riverâ to which the
Calaveras, Stanislaus. Tuolumne and
Merced rivers are tributary, stands in
no greater danger from injunction now
than It has at any time since the entry
of the decree in the .mining debris case.
Now, as then, the courts would take
cognizance only of material injury. ,
"It should be remembered I that â¢' in-
KATE HAYES DECISION.
Thirty mining claims in Trinity
County were located in a week re
cently.
IX SEVERAL COUNTIES.
The San Andreas Prospect reports
that mining is causing more interest in
its vicinity than has been manifested
in several years. The Mountain King
mine has recently been sold at a price
reported to be 5300,000. B. D. Beck
with has sold forty .acres of mineral
land not many miles in a northwester
ly direction from Hodson. Work is
progressing at the Chris Anderson
mine. Work on a dredging proposi
tion will soon begin at Reiliys, below
the town. Five stamps will be added
to the equipment of the Soulsby mine.
The Amador Dispatch reports that
the dividends that the Central Eureka
mine has declared will amount to
120,000 in round numbers.
Concerning recent operations in Sis
kiyou County the Treka Journal says
in substance:
The hydraulic miners have been rushing
work with the elevators and giants, by rea
son of the abundance of water, and are also
pround sluicing extensively. It is reported
that a Scotr River miner picked up a $260 nug-
Ret. washed out during the heavy rain storm.
The ditches of the hydraulic mines at Oro Fino
were damaged by severe rain storms, but will
toon be all right. â¢ A. C. Brokaw has put his
men at work on bonded claims at Salmon
River, and also at the Golden Eagle claim on
Indian Creek. The Morrison & Carlock claim
at vjuartz Valley is worked steadily with a
full torce.
The Kedding Searchlight says that the suit
of T. .1. Foley. J. J. Doyle* M. Arrighini and
D Endlcott against the Balaklala Consolidated
Copper Company to quiet title to about 1W
acres of mineral land in the Flat Creek dis
trict has been comprised. The parties who
bronght th'- action have quitclaimed" their in
terest in the disputed ground.
There is sufficient evidence to be
convincing that the interest in mining
in California is stronger than it has
been in some time. Old mines that
have been shut down will be reopened.
Xew ones will be operated for the
first time. The old Calumet mine at
Quartz Hill, Shasta County, , is one of
the properties to be reopened. Ac
cording to the Redding Free Press
there is a great deal doing in the
Quartz Hill district. The Original
Quartz Hill will run with a full crew.
The Hyatt mine is expected to be re
opened during the coming ; summer
and to have a large force at ' work;
The Meek mine is to resume. There
will be activity at the Afterthought
mine this year. Underground develop
ment has been steadily progressing
during the winter season.
The Grass Valley Union reports that
E. L. Labadie has bonded seven claims,
which are the Hartery, Winfleld Scott,
South Extension of Hartery, Minne
sota, Croesus and Croesus Extension
.and also the Edison- Ancho property at
The Union says:
< The claims in the Grass Valley district ad
join. Of this eroup only the Hartery has ever
been workel to any depth, and that, as mining
Roes to-day, is but a scratch on the surface.
The Hartery was discovered in 1S53. being first
mined by the original owner, Thomas Hartery.
In the latter 00s It was purchased by Mc
Â¦ Lau^hlin &" Lcutzenhelscr. Mr. Loutrenheiser,
still a resided of this city, retains a one
fourth interest in the property. McLaughlin,
a banker oÂ£ San JcsÂ«Â». owning half the claim.
I he remaining fourth being in possession of San
Jo^A parlTr**. The claim is t500x!K>0 feet. A
ehaft exists fronj which three levels were
turned, extending north between 300 and 4';0
feet and youth about SCO feet.
In Amador County the old Plytnouth
mine will be worked again, so says
1 the Adamor Record. The mine is
near the Shenandoah.
According to the Porterville Enter
prise C. B. Rogers is improving a
group of mines in the White River dis
trict.
During: the. yea^ endine December 81. 1903.
thÂ« Xonh Star mines produced a total in value
of $736,087.11. at a current operating cost
of " $259,104 39. and an operating Droflt of
* 476,022 ne, of which lesi than one-half has
been expended on various capital accounts.
During the ypar the company paid out $134.
746 63 for development work, $61,957 77 for
Improvements and $.19,772 4-7 for property pur
chased. A dividend of $11Â«.C<T7 05. or 5 per
cent on ts*e caoital stock, was declared, leav-
Intf n remainder of $121,379.37 to be added to
the cash surplus, which has now reached the
mim of 5224,144 48. The actual profit amount
ed to a little more than $2 per share. During
190:J the North Star minÂ» produced 27,335 tons
of ore, yielding $732,523 61. or $2n 74 per ton.
at an operatins cost of $t* 30 per ton. ThÂ»
unusually profitable production of 1903 Is due
in riart to the exceptionally rich ore body
opened In 1902 between the 1100 and the 10CO
east levels, and developed 30O feet farther
during 1908. by a winze, to the 2300 level.
from whtth source- there have be*n produced
during the past year 10,900 tons of lore, yield
ing $-"?<?Â«. 403 73 '$03 43 per ton), at a profit of
$240,131 tf5. while from the deeper worktops
of the minÂ». opened from the central shaft,
th're has been produced a substantially equiv
alent sum. t
Three hundred closely printed pages
are required to supply a bibliography of
the geology, paleontology and mineral
resources of California. This bare
statement is sufficient to indicate to
fhe reader the interest that California's
minerals,, the direct cause of most of
the literature mentioned in the biblio
graphy, have inspired. State Mineral
ogist Aubury has just issued the biblio
graphy referred to as a guide to all
persons who would learn anything
about California's sources of mineral
wealth. Looming up prominently
among the other publications, as they
are officially enumerated, are the re
ports and bulletins that have been
issued from the State Mining Bureau.
It is shown that the counties that have
had registers and maps prepared by
the bureau include Plumas, Calaveras,
Siskiyou, Trinity. Lake, Nevada, Placer,
El Dorado, Inyo, Shasta, San Bar
nardino, Sierra, San Diego, Amador,
Tuolumne, Butte and Mariposa.
Running over the list of authors who
have contributed to the general fund of
knowledge concerning California from
the view point of geology, paleontology
and mineral resources of the State, the
interest inhering in the general sub
ject will be found to have been excep
tionally strong. An index of the work
by authors takes up more than twenty
pages of the bibliography. An Illus
trious line of scientists and others is
indicated. No one who wishes to know
about any particular phases of the
related topics need longer be at a loss
to find the particular volume that will
deal specifically with matters concern
ing him. Incidentally a large amount of
information is placed in easy reach by
the bibliography, by the publication of
somewhat detailed references to the
contents of certain of the more import
ant books that have been printed dur
ing a series of years in this State.
At the annual meeting of the Xorth
Star Company . an annual report was
submitted. Some extracts from the re
port are as follows:
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF MIXES.
junctions have never run against any
process of mining or against any
mining upon the Klamath and Trinity
rivers and their tributaries, and cannot,
for the reason that neither of those
rivers is navigable, that there are no
agricultural lands on their border*
capable of being injured, arid that both
streams are so torrential In character
that the major portion of the silt is
carried out to sea, where it does no
harm. Mining by the ground aluic*
process and the hydraulic process haÂ«
been conducted there on a large scale
without hindrance since the early days
of mining:, and probably the most Im
portant hydraulic mining operation*
in the State are being conducted there
now. The mining industry of California
stands in no danger from the courts."

Â¦mai } tad Sau&auto Fkut, Foot Mart* SbA Port Arthur policeman committed suicide recently
because he failed to apprehend- certain elusive news
paper correspondents that were making life miserable
for the military authorities. The unfortunate man as
sumed his unwelcome duty with too serious a notion of
its gravity. The correspondents who may be in Port
Arthur have proved themselves to be absolutely harm
less. If they, know anything, about conditions there they
have kept their knowledge a secret.
The present winter has been one
of the severest on record, and nowhere
has this fact been more keenly real
ized than on the railroads of the north
ern part of this country. Not in years
has the service on these lines been so
seriously crippled. Heavy falls of
snow, blown into huge drifts, block
aded the tracks and stalled many a
train, and the intense cold, numbing
the workmen, seriously impaired their
efficiency. Stories have been rife of
the privations and sufferings of travel
era compelled to -remain for weary
hours and even days in chilly cars,
halted in out-of-the-way places and
unable to proceed. But their hard
ships have been trifling compared with
those of the trainmen, necessarily,
from the nature of their duties, ex
posed to 'the bitterest weather. The
way in which leading railroads have
been hampered is shown by the experi
ence of the New York Central, which
at one time had 20,000 freight cars
stalled between New York and Buf-
Winter and the Railroads.
A COMMITTEE .has been organized to make the
appearance of San Francisco ' t more attractive.
This city has extraordinary advantages in its
diversified surface. A flat city is not as capable'of re
ceiving artificial ornamentation as one that has varied
top.ography and altitudes. Many years ago Hon. Fran
cis G. Ncwlands submitted a very co.mprehensive plan
for beautifying San Francisco, which merged public and
private energies to that end. The bonds voted last fall
include a considerable part of his plan and private enter
prise should be'induced to supplement public effort.
A modern city to be attractive needs, in the first place,
the best. street pavements, and in the erection of all
business buildings their exterior graces should be con
sidered. The architect of the Claus Spreckels building
had this in^mind^ and produced what is admitted to be
the only handsome skyscraper in the United States. In
the East the tall buildings" are merely square topped
structures in the planning of which utility alone was
considered. The San Francisco architect treated 'this
building as a column and crowned it with a capital and
dome. â¢
Given well paved streets and business buildings of
attractive exterior in the business section, of the city,

CAUSE OF ACTIONâ A. N. S., City.
In the State of California, if when tha
cause of action accrues against a per
son when he is out of the State, the
action may be commenced within the
time limited after his return to the
State, and if, after the cause of action
accrues, he departs from the State, tha
time of his absence is not part of the
time for the commencement of" the ac
tion. In this State the statute of lim
itation on a written obligation runs
four years if executed in the State and
two years if out of the State.
San Francisco has within her gates. the first assign
ment of Filipino soldiers of the United States to cross
the seas. They seem to be surprised at us and we cer
tainly are at them. They are little, but every inch of
them is soldier. A few." more' such as they will do much

From the silent house the bold ghost
turned â
Why dream that a dream is true?â
Ashes were where Love's fire once
burned;
Death's meaning at last he knaw.
â Smart Set
Had she forgotten what he held fast? â
They say 'tis a woman's way;
Was it only Â¦ a dream that Love could
last,
The dream of an idle day?
The year was young, but the place was.
old.
And the house had gone to sleep.
And the phost that came by night was
For the silence was so deep.
Aloud he called to his heart's fair
queen.
But she would not unbar the door.
And the window from which she used to
lean
Stirred at her touch no more.
In vain through the empty night ha
cried,
Buf there came no answering tone;
And then he bethought him that since
he died Â¦ r -
A hundred years had flown.
But a hundred years should have brought
more near
The Love that he loved so well;
And the bold ghost's heart turned cold
with fear â
Where was the old-time spell?

CHINESE RAILROADâ T. H. E.,
City. The first railroad built In China
with the sanction of the Government
was opened in 1S88.
Ragan's belongings were strewn pro
miscuously on the sidewalk, and close
to them, scattered on the lawn, were
the desks, maps, books and other para
phernalia of a well-regulated school.
Now, there had just been a Grand
July investigation regarding the dis
appearance of some supplies belonging
to the School Department, but the in
quisitorial body exonerated the Board of
Education from any blame in the prem
ises. H. M. Black, the former foreman of
the Grand Jury which had conducted
the inquiry, chanced to come down on
the Haight street car and was inex
pressibly pained to see the desks and
other school articles surrounding Ra
gan's house.
"Well, I declare," said Black to a
friend as the car passed. "And to think
that we cleared those School Directors
of any wrong doing. It's a shame that
Ragan should have the effrontery to
flaunt in the public gaze the very
things which we said he and hia col
leagues did not appropriate."
Health Officer Ragan tells this story
on himself. Shortly after Ragan had
completed his term as a member of the
Board of Education, some years ago, he
moved from his old home on Haight
street to a more commodious residence.
The Haight street house- had been rent
ed in the meantime to a lady who con
ducted a private school, and on the day
Ragan moved ouL>the school moved in.

Mystery surrounds the disappear
ance of Captain Hultin. formerly of
the Finnish Guard in St. Petersburg.
A few years ago he retired from his
military post in the Russian capital
and accepted a position as president
of the Scandanavian Commercial Bu
reau in Berlin. Again he resigned his
posltfon and returned to St. Peters
burg, where he entered the employ of
a mercantile firm. Later he became
a political suspect and as a result the
police entered his house and made ;i
thorough search for evidence against
him. It resulted in nothing, however.
Hultin, conscious of his innocence,
felt that an injustice had been done to
him, went to the Chief of Police and
demanded satisfaction. From this
visit he never returned.

Piqtorially, the Sunday Call to-morrow will be quite
up to its standard of excellence. For instance, there
is a, full page of photographs of the girls who are play
ing "Ring Hockey," the newest gymnasium game; a full
page of photographs of the beautiful society women of
Santa Cruz; a full-page photograph in multiple colors
of Baby Helene Muller: a page of "Parisian Novelties
for Easter"; a "Scrap-BooK Page" of the strangest
things under the sun, and many attractive features
besides.
In a lighter vein but in the field" of pure literature
are several pages of the latest and most popular fiction.
First there is the fourth installment of "To-morrow's
Tangle." the stirring California novel, by Geraldine Bon
ner, the famous California authoress, for the exclusive
rights of which the Sunday Call paid $1000. Then follows
the second of_the series of sea stories by Albert Son
nichsen, the California writer who is now the literary
lion of the hour in New York. It is called the "Mur
derer Who Laughed." "In the Matter <?f His Nibs,"
by Francis Walton and Josiah Flynt, is no less unique
and equally thrilling. Added to this is "Mrs. Bluebeard,"
by Izofa Forrester, . and a full page of "Half-hour
Storiettes," which are truly fascinating.
GALEN CLARK, for more than half a century a
pioneer of the Golden West, and for twenty-six
, years "Guardian of the Yosemite," at 90 years of
age has been prevailed upon to write a truly notable and
valuable book about the wonderful valley and the
Indians who inhabited it when he made his first visit
among them in 1855. Thousands upon thousands of
people have visited Yosemite and marveled at its grand
cur, but it is a surprising fact that few of theirT carry
away any knowledge of Chief Teneiya and his tribe,
who ruled the valley when the adventurous miners first
came to wrest it from him and enslave his warriors.
Fewer still know anything of the war of extermination
that was waged on both sides almost immediately
thereafter, even though it is comparatively recent his
tory.
And besides being one of the original surveyors of
the famous "Mariposa Grant," -Mr. Clark was the dis
coverer of the Mariposa Big Tree Grove, which, to
gether with Yosemite Valley itself, he was chiefly in
strumental in bringing under Government control. Thus
this remarkable man perhaps knows more about the sub
ject on which he writes than any one else in the world,
and for this reason, too, the copious extracts that have
been made from an advanced copy of the book, and
which will be published in the Sunday Call to-morrow
by special permission, easily make up the most interest
ing and important article of the year.
But even apart from this notable contribution the
Sunday Call to-morrow will present many excellent
magazine features. On the page devoted to the "Timely
Topics of the World" is a big birdseye view photo
graph of the St. Louis Exposition, with an article de
scribing the wonders that will be displayed at the big
fair. Another timely article gives a graphic descrip
tion of how the ancient gods of war are being invoked
in the Far East. Still another tells how American
farmers are being made out of Russian Hebrews by
scientific methods.
Equally valuable with Galen Clark's book are the
recollections and reflections of Thomas Fitch, the famous
orator, on John C. Fremont, one of California's grandest
heroes.

After persistent and apparently unreasoning denial by
the Japanese the world now has proof that one of their
cruisers was sunk in the sea fight off Chemulpo. Do the
little brown men seek to enhance their reputation for
prowess and bravery by picturing their foe as imbecile?
A brave fighter loves a. brave antagonist and from
the conflict comes with greater glory in either victory or
defeat.

If one would desire to lay down a
iwt of laws to govern advancement
lpon the stage, one is struck at the
outset by the elusiveness of the
scheme, for the drama, like all other
arts, requires the innate artistic sense.
When that is once found, as a gen
eral rule, it forces itself into a hear
ing, like the sprout that grows under
the ground and forces itself into the
5un, into the plant or shrub or beau
tiful flower It is ordained to be. It is
the strength of the inborn artistic
sense that will make itself be felt more
or less, according: to its worth and in
tensity. Whatever may be said to aid
an actor can only be set forth In a
few rules of ethics â a moral guidance
that will not make an actor of a man
whom nature has not ordered to be
one. but would help in lending a clean
ly aid to the drama in those who
would succeed. The actor Is a law
unto himself. He is innately an actor.
There is a temperament that gives
conviction to the audience â there is
a nature that gives grace and a.llows
the elasticity to take on and give out
emotion, for that is the great effort
for which the actor's energies are
bent â the giving out of emotion. I
have seen humble supernumeraries
who tvere great aciors, though they
did r.ot know it. They had the grace
and the power of expression which
r^ome others, cast for leading roles,
< ould never hope to equal. No set of
rules will make a man an actor. Xo
help will assist him to span mediocrity
if he is not a dramatic artist at heart.
I- have always contended that the
actor's art embraces all the other arts.
In his own being he brings out the ef
fects aimed at in the color emotions
of the painter, in the prose emotions of
the sculptor, in the thought emotions
of the author, in the soul emotions of
the poet, in the magnetic emotions of
the orator. He incorporates these In a
composite whole in his work and re
flects them in himself. The laws of
success in each of these branches of art
enter of necessity into the art of the
actor.

' (CotQ-ri&A. 19M. ty Joseph U- Howies.)
En every profession, trade, occupation,
the question cf ho'.v to achieve the
highest possible resultâ to vie with
some master â to succeed, is to-day the
all engrossing thought of men and
women.
At no other period of the world was
ever go much thought, care and study
paid to the question of success as now.
Successâ that invigorating, fresh-air
tonic â success and how to gain it â is
a theme uppermost in men's minds.
One cannot view the great attention
th3t is being paid to the problem of
achievement but become convinced that
'.he tendency of the world is to become
rysterr.atlzed, that less is being left to
chance, that the ways of the struggling
.-.re being lightened and that it is gradu
ally becoming: more possible to accom
plish great things than ever before.
The drama, enrolling in its devotees
the best thought and energies of the
thousands, has become a force that is
daily being reckoned with more and
more. When Victor Hugo many years
pgo called the actor the high priest in
hi? pulpit, who sows seeds of thought,
he ?poke with the voice of a seer that
was not taken seriously by his genera
tion, but was to be listened to a hun
dred years after. The great multitudes
of theatergoers who attend theaters
nightly throughout this country are a
tribute to the art of the actor, the sur
roundings of the stage and the neces
sities of the drama as a means of rec
reation. It now rests with the actor
to make It a means of ennoblement.
How to succeed as an actor, how to
pay the warmest tribute to the drama,
how to give the public the greatest re
j=ults of the actor's efforts are sub
2i*i*'worthy of close attention from
the best minds.
The "Actor's Profession.
As an administrative entity China has sovereignty of
Mukden. If the Japanese had occupied it there would
be an immediate protest from St. Petersburg, and the
nations would be compelled to take notice. Japan may
hot choose to protest, leaving that to the Governments
which accepted Mr. Hay's note. It would be tactics
for Japan to let the Russian violation of Chinese neu
trality become apparent, permitting resistance of China
to develop into defensive measures which would amount
to involving China in the struggle. This would create
a diversion of value to Japan, provided that China could
master a sufficient force to offer effective resistance. Of
this, however, there may be doubt. The outside world
knows but little about the armament and military
capacity of China, but she is supposed to be weak,
except in the enormous number of her people. The
Chinese fight, when they have to, and given proper
arms and discipline could be sufficiently formidable to
keep Russia busy for some time.
As the most important foreign affairs of China are
now in charge of Wu Ting Fang, the diplomatic part
will be conducted by him with great intelligence, for he
has an experience greater than any other Chinese states
man since Li Hung Chang. He has the ability to make
clear to the Western nations any controversy in which
Russian aggression or effrontery may involve the
empire.
In the judgment of Americans, who act from their
convictions of what human liberty means, and without
prejudice engendered by remote collateral issues, the
struggle between Russia and Japan appears as a conflict
between absolutism and representative government.
Wherever the Russian standard is planted stands "the
scepter that ends with a cimeter and the cross that ends
with a knout." It is absolutism, the most retrogressive
and opposed to the spirit of the age. The institutions
of China are democratic by comparison.
It was the belief of Bonaparte that the Russian spirit
would never change and it has not changed since his
time. Since the Italian campaign every Continental Gov
ernment except Russia has been liberalized by the rise
of parliamentary institutions, through which the people
have some voice in their Government. It is a step for
ward in the enlargement of the protection of human
rights. Only Russia stands where the savage Rurik
placed her. This gives her a certain advantage in such
adventures as she is attempting in Eastern Asia. Her
Government, being autocratic and executive, does not
have to consult the people, who have only the privilege
of fighting for the Czar for 17 cents a month and found,
and of dying for a system that keeps them in ignorance
and degradation.
Such a Government .cannot be questioned at home
and it carries its methods abroad with Confidence. Its
proposition to use Chinese territory as a base is one
result. If any nation with a Parliament and popular rep
resentation did such a thing its administration would be
questioned, as is done in the British Parliament, our
Congress and the legislative bodies of the Continent:
But the nobles, who control even the Czar, permit no
inquiry and have no questions to answer, unless they are
asked by other nations! We will see whether Mukden
will provoke inquiry from any quarter. Â¦
Mukden is not very far from Peking and would be a
valuable Russian base for an attack on the capital. Its
occupancy by the forces of the Czar is an intimidation
of the Chinese Government. It is probable that this,
and similar acts, will be indulged in by Russia, to force
China into resistance, and then the claim will be made
from St. Petersburg that China has" violated neutrality.
Russia is a past master in such tactics and may not
be expected to omit their use in the present struggle
for control of Eastern Asia. Her policy is one of exas
peration, to force the other party into an overt act.
If it do not succeed in this, then the foothold she
has gained by craft is made permanent. In dealing with
the countries she has overrun in her progress toward
Eastern Asia, she has pursued this course of occupy
ing what does not belong to her and then treating re
sistance as an act of aggression, to be punished by
every cruelty that her Cossacks can inflict.
The United States has sought,, through '.Mr.. Hay's note
to the powers, to protect China against these tactics,
and it remains to be seen whether the nations interested
in the autonomy of China will be listless spectators of
such aggressions as will destroy China if not resisted,
and will furnish Russia an excuse to subvert that em
pire if resisted.
IT is reported that Russia has ordered the Chinese
out of the Chinese town of Mukden, with the in
tention of occupying it with a Russian garrison.
Mukden is in Chinese territory and administration.
Russia has never had territorial jurisdiction nor .sov
ereignty there. The best evidence of this is that the
United States has treaties with China covering Mukden
as a Chinese port, and providing for an American Consul
there, whose exequatur has to be issued by the Chinese
Government.
A copy of this letter found its way
Into the farr hands of a Vassar College
senior, who at once organized a so
ciety among her classmates for Its
study and interpretation. After some
weeks spent in erudite deliberation
they reached the conclusion that the
first sentence was an order for certain
articles named In the manufacturers*
catalogue, while the second apologized
for the insignificance of the order and
acknowledged the firm's courtesy in
forwarding its list. The third and
fourth sentences were found to contain
a discussion of 'the difficulties of es
tablishing a trade in high-class sport-
Ing goods in Japan, where the fishing
was mostly done by professionals. The
epistle closes with a little flourish of
characteristic Japanese politeness.
But while the learned seniors at Vas
sar were pondering over its mysteries
the New oYrk house had filled the or
der and got its pay from the courteous
Mr. Nakamura.
"Wishing we now at Japan there it
was not in prevailing fish-gaming but

we do not measure how, the progression
of the fishing game beforehand. There

The present interest in things Japa
nese gives timeliness to the publication
of a letter gent several years ago by a

On its face this curious bit of Japanese
English would seem to have been writ

show that it could not have been com

tongue, is as follows:

the committee of beautifiers may find much room for
Â¦improvement in the residence districts. There every
possible use should be made of the tropical foliage to
which our climate is kindly- The heights, such as Rus-Â»
sian and Telegraph hills, Buena Vista and Twin Peaks,
are susceptible of being made most alluring features.
Buena Vista is already a" park reservation. Not many of
our people ever visit its summit, from which there is
a view of the bay, the ocean and far scenery, including
Tamalpais, Diablo, Mission Peak and the Farallones.
Nature has' lavished charms within the corporate limits
which the people of other cities' go far to seek.
Let it be understood, also, that cleanliness is always
beautiful. A clean city has charms that a dirty city
cannot have. In this respect San Francisco has beeti
greatly improved since the merchants took the matter
in hand. Rough pavements are not easily kept clean,
so that to be clean streets must be well paved, and one
improvement begets another.
San Francisco can be made the most attractive of the
great commercial cities of the United States. At pres
ent our water front is repulsive. The old wooden build
ings are tottering to their fall, but will be propped and
crutched as long as they bring rents out of proportion to
their value. Some betterment is appearing cm the front,
and it is to be hoped that owners there will follow the
few examples thaÂ£have appeared. The better and more
beautiful our bui^pigs, the cleaner and more ornamental
our streets, the better will be our local governments. A
dirty and forbidding town is less mindful of its municipal
> administration than one that is clean, and attractive.
The owner of the Kohinoor would not keep it in grimy
surroundings and ignoble company. A clean city means
clean hands in its government.
The new committee on beauty has an important duty
and deserves general encouragement.
The watching of the simple things
of life is paramount. When I began
my career I one day walked through
j a public park at sundown with a promi
nent actor. A man sitting upon a
bench suddenly lit his pipe. My friend
caught me by the hand and watched
the play of the light effect over the
man's face and surroundings. A short
I time after that I saw him in a repro
l duction that had a marvelous array
I of light effect in it. I praised it to
I him, and he called to mind the scene
we witnessed of the man lighting his
pipe. From that simple incident he
had caught the suggestion for a novel
lighting effect of an entire scene.
! Among some of the impassioned
j thoughts of Guy de Maupassant Is
this: "The public is. composed of
I numerous groups who say to us, 'Con
, sole me, amuse me, make me sad,
I make me sentimental, make me
I dream, make me laugh, make me
j tremble, make me weep, make me
j think,' but there are some chosen
! spirits who demand of the artist 'Make
! for me something fine in the form
which suits you best, following your
own temperament.' "
The actor who is sincere will make
his work like unto his innermost soul.
! Let him look to it that that soul is
good and clean and wholesome, then
he will have a great and pleasing per
sonality that others will love. They
will wish to see him and cherish him
during his life and perhaps for a few
days fn memory after his death; and
to be loved for our work while we
j work, and to be spoken of kindly for
a little while after we have made our
final exit, is the greatest meed of suc
cess the actor can. hope for. If he
gains this he has reached the highest
round of success of the "actor's art.
I would like to tabulate the require
ment* of an actor's art as follows:
1. Character.
2. The management of his career.
3. To keep himself -simple and
natural.
: 4. Alertness watching the actions
I of life. , .
! 5. Incessant work.
There has been much ado at certain
times over what has been termed the ;
artificiality at the actor's art â a cry ;
that he leads an unnatural life, that '
his whole life's work consists of dis
sembling and assuming a thing which
is not. It is true, the first impression
a beginner gets is that romance ends
behind the asbestos curtain. The moon
to which he utters impassioned ad
dresses is only a box light, with per
haps a tobacco stained man operating
it; the sunshine is but admass of blind
ing lights, the mountains but painted
daubs and the woman he makes love
to perhaps is the one he passes in the
dining-room with a chilly good-day.
Well, what of all that? The painter
does not place upon his canvas the
real effect of the sky; the sculptor
simply reproduces the pose of life in
senseless marble; the orator commands
thought through figments of speech;
the actor's art calls for him in his
own person to become a thing which
exists first mere.ly in his brain, but
that is his art â to make unrealities
real â and he must bend his energies
upon an ability to create perfect illu
sion If he would endeavor to succeed.
Scientists tell us the color of the sun
we look upon as golden is in reality
blue, and we know the tints we see
in the horizon denoting a sunset are
not the real pigments, but simply illu
sions; so we afterward learn that ro
mance is romance on the stage only
as it exists in oneself.
actor's career is his stock in trade. It
is the merchandise with which he
loads his shelf. It is his verr work.
It is the thin? from which he is to get
his credit. It represents his toil. It
is well to take an inventory; of his
career very often to pee where' he has
succeeded â to note where ho has fail
ed. When one has done this, one will
learn at once the value of integrity,
without which success in no walk of
lite can be grained.
I have known many who have all
the attributes -of great actors, but who
huve not the position they should hold
because they have not managed their
careers well. In the search for the
artistic they forgot the almost busi
ness side of the actor's life. It has
many times brought to my mind a
story Sir Walter Scott tells of a pil
i^rim who entered a monastery for
the night and was surprised to see all
the holy inmates performing the most
manual of labor. Some utilized wheel
barrow?, others the humble spade.
The pilgrim held up his hands in
horror. " We are holy men," he said.
"It is our duty to pray. Such mater
ial work is not for us." He prayed
zealously in a cell when he was shown
to it, and when he was not called to
supper he asked to see the abbot.
"Your reverence, I am hungry," he
said. "You said our duty here was
simply to pray," said the holy father.
"Keep on praying, my son."
The management of a man's career
calls constantly for a watch over the
ethics of his heart so that he does no
unwise thing. It keeps him keen for
what Marcus Aurelius centuries ago
so aptly called "Keep the thoughts
upon the. main chance."
are those who, in the!r dreamy search
for the artistic, overlook the practical
.side of life, the part thnt is necessary
for all men to keep strictly, in view.
There is a debit and credit side^.rff
every man's career. It is necessary
for him to keep a sort of spiritual
hook, keep his balance, if possible, al

that on April 23, 1896, he entered into
a contract with the defendants where
by he was to receive a fifth interest

leged also that the defendants were
willing to pay $35,000 for the mine
and that by reason of his services he

Ferrall took up the cudgels for his
chief and declared that they would

"The District Attorney should not

"None of the jury could hear me,"
protested Byington.
"I could hear you up here, although

Delaware, by sending to her through j
the mails from this city a box of j
poisoned candy. The candy which !
caused the death of Mrs. Dunning also j
killed her f ister, Mrs. Deane. and, in ;
the event of an acquittal in the present j
cape, Mrs. Botkin will have to answer j
to a charge of murdering Mrs. Deane.
The last two jurors were chosen yes- t
tc-rciay. In the morning session Samuel
P. Robbins proved acceptable to- both
Bides and was sworn in. Late in the
afternoon session John P. Carroll was |
accepted and the box was filled.
It was 3:40 o'clock in the afternoon
before the last juror was secured and i
only six names out of the special venire I
r-rnained to be drawn. Fifty-two tales
man had been examined when Carroll
was called to the box, and out of all
these only one man had proved accept
able. The defense still had three per
emptory challenges left and the prose
cution two. None expected panel
to be filled and it was confidently
thoupht that another venire would be
found necessary.
The Board of Public Works Is plan
ning to make several improvements in
the City Hall and will petition the
Board of Supervisors to make the nec
essary appropriations therefor in the
next municipal budget. '
The Bureau of Public Buildings yes
terday completed its estimate of the
amounts required to conduct its affairs
during the next fiscal year. The bu
reau recommends the construction of
an additional electric passenger eleva
tor in the main corridor of the City
Hall at an estimated cost of $7500; also
the installation of a heating plant for
the western end of the City Hall to
cost $20,000, and the construction of
a . balustrade in the second story of
the City Hall dome to cost $4000, the
present wooden partition being deemed
Inadequate for safety,
j The bureau also favors the cleaning
of the granite on the City Hall, which
will cost an additional SSQOO.
The entire amount asked for by the
Bureau of Buildings for the mainte
nance oÂ£ the City Hall, including its
cleaning during the year, is $143,523 75.
Of this amount $9350 is for supplies..
For the maintenance of the Hall of
Justice it is figured that $25,981 will
be required.
Tha Bureau of Engineering estimates
that it will require the sum of $90,840
to conduct its office during 1904-1905.
.It estimates that the receipts of the
bureau in fees will aggregate $20,000
during the year.
GRAND . JURY INVESTIGATES
CONDITION OP THEATERS
Commissioner of Works "Herbert
Schmitz Makes Verbal Report.
Other Business Transacted.
AJ a session of the Grand Jury yes
terday afternoon, in compliance with
a recent request qf that body, Herbert
Schmitz, president of the Board of
Public Works, made a verbal report
on what the various playhouses in the
city are doing relative to the ordin
ance providing for the safety of au
diences and proper fire fighting ap
paratus. He stated that the majority
of theaters had already complied with
the orders of the Board of Works and
the others had promised to make the
necessary alterations and additions at
once. .
The matter of the condition of un
accepted streets was also inquired into
and Commissioner Schmitz informed
the jury that no action could be taken
by the Board of Works if the abut
ting property owners did not favor the
improvement of the thoroughfares.
The condition of the remodeled Wood
ward's Garden Pavilion came in for
some discussion and a report from the
building: inspector certifying: to its
safety was read.
Owing to Chief Wittman's inability
to attend the session the report of the
Police Committee was not acted upo f n.
The report shows that the number of
arrests for battery in 1903 was 1062.
Of these 787 were dismissed. 202 con
victed, 20 forfeited bail and 12 were
fined without alternative, which is
equivalent to dismissal. The remain
der were disposed of in the Juvenile
Court or their cases are pending.
The Grand Jury will meet a'gain
next Friday.

A. K. Daggett, the notary public,
who, with W. T. Kearns, was a defend
ant in a suit in which charges of fraud
were made by the plaintiff, E. Murphy,
is no longer concerned in the suit.
Judge Seawell made an order yester
day directing the dismissal of the suit
as to the notary. The suit was over
the estate of Jane Canney.
As t<J the demand for $8O1S. approved by
resolution No, 4305. I find tha charter require
ment that the same Fhall "specify each sev
eral item, date and amount composing it" suffi
ciently complied with in the. statement in the
demand that it is presented "for water fur
nished for uee of hydrants during month of
January. 19O4,' 4024 hydrants at $2 each, VS(M3."
No definite amount of water is required to
meet the demands of hydrant service, the sup
ply being sufficient to meet any eudden de
mand. Such service 1b reduced to a flat rate
of $2 a month without reference to the amount
actually used.
As to the demand for JUCC 65. approved by
resolution No. 4394. on the contrary, I find no
reference whatever to the amount of water sup
plied to the public buildings enumerated there
in. The demand contains a statement in de
tail of the buildings pupplled with water and
the date of tsupply covered by the demand, but
no reference is made to the amount so sup
plied. This oversight Is no doubt due to the
fact that your Finance Committee has en
tered Into an understanding with the com
pany whereby It is to be allowed one-twelfth
part each month of the appropriation for the
fiscal year 1903-1904, which sum appears to be
much less than like charges made to private
consumers, but a more detailed statement of
the amount of water, i .supplied each public
building Is possible, as appears from such
statement subsequently made by the company
to your board, and it is my opinion that the
charter requires the same.
City Attorney Long yesterday filed
an opinion with the. Board of Super
visors in which he holds that the de
mand for $3048 for hydrants submitted
by the Spring Valley Water Company
for January is in legal form and should
be allowed, but the demand for $1166 63
for water furnished public buildings is
insufficient In its present form and
should be amended before payment.
The advice of the City attorney waa
asked in the matter in view of the fact
that Mayor Schmitz had vetoed or
dinances authorizing .the payment of
the demands on the ground that they
did not comply with the charter re
quirements. The opinion says:
It is Impossible that the demands presented
tfcould refer to the ordinance authorizing tha
incurrinc of the liability out of which they
arise, either by title, date or section, as the
ordinance of 1903 has been suspended by In
junction. It la my opinion that in so far aa
the Mayor"* objections to the demands relate
to this matter they are untenable under tho
law, " -
It is further objected, however, that tho de
mands are insufficient in this, that they do
not "specify the quantity of water supplied or
the rate or rates charged."
Among the g-oods that were seized
yesterday was a \aluable stock of pre
pcrved ginger and spices.
A tall Chinaman with a black eye
and a bright emerald sweater vouch
safed the information that Kwong had
gone "catchem Fresno"; that he has
friends there, and will stay in hiding
until his debts are outlawed.
Strance to say, when the last arrest
hai been made and the book was gone
over, it was found that in every case
the prisoner had given the name of
â¢Sing."
According to the stories told by his
neighbors, Kwons had a rather poor
standing In the Chinese Bradstreets.
Kwong, they say, owes money to every
one that he knows in Chinatown, and
they universally say "Him no good."
Owing to his inability io settle with
his creditors, among whom is an irate
landlady, Kwong On Lung, head of the
firm of Kwong On Lung & Co.. "26
Jackson street, fc?ft town hurriedly
about a month ago, leaving behind a
large stork of rice, nuts, oil and other
Chinefe delicacies.
In figuring up her accounts against
Kwong, Anna Moore, owner of the prop
erty at. 726 Jackson street, found to
her dismay that the Celestial tenant
had gotten the best of her by J1S9.
The store was locked up, and was
stocked with all varieties of goods.
Miss Moore thought that she . might
pquare matters by claiming them, but
was informed that the only way . in
which Fhe might claim her property
would be to have _the Sheriff take
charge of the stock of goods.
Accordingly yesterday morning the
Sheriff and deputies arrived at the
building and proceeded to unceremoni
ously throw open the doors and pile
the merchandise out on the street.
Before two boxes had been carried
out Chinese of all sizes and descrip
tions poured in from all directions. As
each load of stuff was taken to the street
the crowds thronged about it and gazed
longingly on the delicacies. Some even
went so far as to grab boxes of noodles
and rice when the officers' backs were
turned. The police gave chase, how
ever, and each time locked up the of
fender on a charge of petty larceny.
By the time the store was cleared out
several arrests were made. One Chi
naman, about SO years of age, was
caught running down Jackson street
dragging a hag of rice. He was easily
overtaken and booked with the rest.
The Supervisors' Judiciary Committee
yesterday considered the petition of
Charles and Harry Bush that the suit
brought by the city to compel the re
moval of a staircase projecting eighteen
Inches on the sidewalk for a frontage of
fifty-two feet at the northeast corner
of Franklin and Eddy streets, in front
of the premises owned by the petition
ers, be dismissed by the City Attorney.
The latter stated that the steps were
built under a permit granted by resolu
tion of the Board of Supervisors on
April 2, 1800, and a permit for the
same was also granted by the Board of
Public Works on September 26. 1900.
Attorneys Choynski, Lane and Coffey
argued the matter for their respective
clients, the last named claiming that
the Board of Supervisors had not the
power to permit the steps to remain on
the sidewalk, even though it had orig
inally granted a permit for the same.
Choynski charged that Coff ey had inti
mated that the trouble . between the
Bush brothers and his client, A. Pet
zold, the adjoining * property owner,
could be settled for a money considera
tion. "Coffey said that he had simply
stated that he would lay the offer of
the Bushes to settle before his client.
The committee took theTnatter under
advisement, but is in a quandary how
to act, as Bush Brothers acted under a
regular permit from the Supervisors in
the premises.
The joint Supervisors' Committee on
Judiciary and Fire yesterday referred
to. Assistant Chief Shaughnessy of
the Fire Department, L. Deane and
W. H. Mooser of the Architects' Asso
ciation and City Architect Shea the
proposed ordinance regulating fire es
capes In buildings for a report thereon.
' Louis Brownstone and M. A. Najhan
appeared before the Judiciary Commit
tee in behalf of their petition to collect
certain moneys overpaid by the city to
the State for a 25 per cent commission.
The petitioners were given two weeks
to file authorities on the question.
The consideration of the proposed or
dinance prescribing a district within
which it is prohibited to hold meetings
on the public streets will be taken up

Nor is the weather the only thing
that the Stanford athletes have had
to contend with; they have also had
their share of hard luck. Two of the
promising candidates for the varsity
nine have been obliged to give up their
work on the diamond owing to the
strict faculty ruling as to scholarship.
Sales, '06, candidate for pitcher and the
heaviest hitter on the team, has been
"on the shelf" for several day^ as the
result of the dislocation of one of his
knees, an injury he received in batting
practice last week. He Is improving
rapidly, however, and is expected to
be back 'in the game again by the time
the baseball field gets dry enough to
play upon.
While the baseball mien have trou
bles enough to keep them worried, the
track athletes are not without theirs.
Russell. '06, one of the best of the quar
ter-milers, has a bad ankle and strained
tendon and may be kept out of the
running for some time. He has shown
great speed in the recent- tryouts on
the track, beating Crossman, the var
sity quarter man, in the last field day.
"Brick" West, '06, is also on the re
tired list for the present as the result
of a strained muscle. He 'recently
equaled In practice the Stanford record
of 21 feet 10 inches In the broad Jump
and has been counted upon as a point
winner. His Injury Is of such a na
ture that . it may prevent him from
jumping altogether.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
18. â The month of March, up to the
present time, has been a particularly
bad one for work on the diamond and
on the cinder path. Practice on both
diamond and track is practically at a
standstill. Treasurer Cowden has been
compelled so far to call off a half dozen
or â¢ more games and meets owing to
the inclemency of the weather.
The first round of a ninety-six-dog
open stake will be run to-day at Ingle

The coursing season will close at
Stockton on the 27th inst.. on account
of the opening of the baseball season.
The pa3t season was the most suc
cessful ever, experienced by the Pacific
Coursing Club. Judge Andrew Dean
has been presiding in the saddle re
cently, and has given satisfaction. .
The officials of Union Coursing Park
expect to hold the first contest for the
grand national champion stakes on
April 3. It is expected that Palo Alto
and Pocatelli will meet in the first
series of trials. Both greyhounds are
being given a special preparation .in
view of the approaching competition.
Regular monthly puppy stakes will
be resumed at Union Park in May.
The entries will be limited to twelve,
and winners will be barred from suc
ceeding stakes. After the first stake
preference In entries will be given the
six dogs beaten in the first round. This
will give all the young greyhounds a
chance to gain experience on the field.
P. M. Clarkson has been appointed
secretary of Ingleside Coursing Park
to succeed \\'llliam Elliott. The new
official has been identified with the
sport for many .years, both as owner
and official.'

So'secure did the golfers, feel in their
tenure that it was proposed to improve
the rugged, broken ground lying be
tween the present course and the.Ma
rine Hospital and to lay out nine holes
upon It, so as to have a| full eighteen
hole course. When the cavalry had cut
up the present course it was thought a
new course might be laid out, to be
used in the event of it becoming neces
sary to abandon the'old one.
A 'little reflection showed the futility
of this plan) In a few years, after the
golfers had expended thousands of dol
lars and had developed a fine expanse
of velvety turf, the eyes of some cav
alry officer would be likely, to covet the
well-grassed area, which would seem
excellently adapted to showy evolutions
of well-drilled troopers. The golfers
have decided to seek pastures new.
They are likely to go out in the direc-,
tion of Ingleside. The handsome:club
house standing Just outside the Presidio
reservation would be sold, and on ac
count of the increase in value in real
estate In that part of the city. would
probably bring a price greater than its
cost.

A special meeting of the members of
the San Francisco Golf Club will be
held at the clubhouse, near the Presidio
reservation, this afternoon at 4 o'clock
for the purpose of considering the es
tablishment of new links. The course
on the Presidio reservation has been so
cut up by the cavalry and artillery evo
lutions that it is in an unplayable con
dition.
Even if the members were willing to
expend several hundred dollars in re
pairing some of the damage, the liabil
ity to have the course ruined again
would still exist. When General Gra
ham first gave permission to the golf
ers to lay out a course on the reserva
tion the ground was overgrown with
bushes, tufts of iris and rough grass.
It was quite unsuitable for. use even as
an exercising ground and would never
have attracted the eyes of a cavalry
officer looking for a place on which to
perform evolutions. By the expenditure
of several thousand dollars the golf
club transformed the rough tract Into a
fine links, covered with springy turf.
Each succeeding commanding officer
after General Graham has been equally
friendly to' the golfers, who had beauti
fied and improved a large area' of the
reservation. . -

Considerable dissatisfaction has
been expressed by the members over
the loose way in which the tourna
ments are being run. Last Sunday
four teams were put in the tourna
ment not only after the entry list was
closed, but even after the drawings
had been held. These four teams were
put in the first round instead of the
preliminary and consequently were
asked to play one less , match than
those who were there on time. Surely
the players should not be rewarded
for their carelessness. Another inter
esting f3ct is that all three of these
teams left to play on Sunday are of
the four that were put in late.' In
future a time for the closing of en
tries and for the drawing will be set
and players will be unable to get. in
after this time. ;:,i>
Gray and Wood are the first limit
team to reach the semi-finals. They
will receive odds of "15 4-6." while
Salisbury and Stringham will "owe
15." This is a liberal handicap and
it would not be at all surprising if the
lower class men carried off the tourna
ment honors. '.\ : \
On the California Club courts two
tournament matches will be played.
The handicap doubles was started last
Sunday and In the upper half Will
Allen and Tracy Crawford reached
the finals. In the lower half Sidney
Salisbury and Frank Stringham will
meet Leonard Wood and Herbert
Gray. ' ; "
The Murdock brothers can hardly
hope to win. Percy Murdock classes
with MacGavin and Variel, but his
brother has played but little and is
somewhat outclassed. The match will
be called at 2 o'clock.
If the weather permits there will
be some intere-ting matches on the
tennis courts to-morrow, both here
and at Oakland. After many post
ponements the Alameda County cham
pionships will be brought to a close.
The only match left is the finals of the
doubles. The opposing teams will be
the Murdock brothers. Hamilton and
Percy of Alameda and Drummond
MacGavin and Robert Variei, repre
senting the California Tennis Club
and the University of California.
The college men are strong favor
ites, but \ .. have to play better than
they did last Sunday. Variel was
away off. but has been playing a con
sistent game of late. If he gives Mac-
Gavin any kind of support his team
should win.

selves as to the merits of Hank's 1304
aggregation.
The home team has not enjoyed a
whole lot of needed practice owing to
the condition of the weather during the
past month and this may handicap the
players to a certain â¢ degree. Yet if
they are the real goods and have any
tight in them they should be able to
at least make the big leaguers hustle
some before the game is completed. On
Sunday afternoon the same two teams*
v. ill line up once more, with a cnange of
pitchers.
Jimmy Whalen and Winnie Cutter
are due to appear on Uncle's slab this
afternoon. If any one in the Coast
League will stop the jj great Chicago
sluggers it is Whalen. For the last
three years he has been the mainstay
on the home slab, and for that reason
the fans all look to him to buffalo the
Eastern stars this afternoon.
Big Bert Jones and Stanley Yerkes
will have a try at the stars on Sunday
afternoon. The grounds are a little
soft after the recent rains, but with
a few hours of sunshine they will dry
out readily. The grass has sprouted
out all over the outfield, while the in
field is as smooth as glass. If San
Francisco does not have a champion
ball team this year it will at least pos
sess a swell ball grounds.
The ever reliable Tommy Leahy will
do most of the catching in the two
games against the Chicago club.
Tommy is in the best of shape and
ready for the opening of the season.
The fans will rely a whole lot on Leahy
to bring the pennant home to Uncle
and hÂ« will certainly do his share of
the work. The teams will probably line
up as follows this afternoon:
San Francisco. Position. Chicago.

been built by them. They are the
Humboldt I. II and III. â¢ The first
named is the only one of the three
that has been launched. It is one of
the largest boats In the fleet, meas
uring seventy-nine Inches.
The San Francisco Model Yacht
Club will open the racing 1 season far
IS 04 to-morrow on Spreckels Lak-J
in Golden Gate Park. The owners of
the small boats have beerf anxiously
awaiting this occasion. For several
weeks most of the owners have bÂ«ea
out accustoming themselves to tli*
different courses and surroundings.
The racing season last year was satis
factory, but this year the competition
will be better. The models will not
meet with interference from rowboati
as the'y did last year on Stow Lak-s
and the banks are much better on the
new lake. A lack of wind also mad3
racing rather difficult at times. The
yacht owners will not have this ti>
contend with this season, us there is
always a good breeze over the new
lake. ?.-;

LOS ANGELES, March IS. â James
F. Morley, manager of the Los An
geles baseball team, who has Just re
turned from the meeting of the Pa
cific Coast League managers at San
Francisco, denies the Dillon case has
been settled. He still hopes to hold
his first baseman. Morley will deal
directly with the parties in the East
with claims on Dillon's services and
expects to soon have a termination of
the dispute.
Morley SU11 Claims Dillon.
The sloop Phoenicia, upon which
her owner has expended a great deal
of work -and considerable money dur
ing the winter, was carried against the
bows of the old schooner Tropic Bird
where she pounded hard, suffering
much damage. The Mikado, on the
other side, of the Tropic Bird, was car
ried against a cottage, the end and
one side of which were completely
ripped out, nearly everything In the
cottage being destroyed. To scuttle
her and prevent her from doing fur
ther harm, a dynamite cartridge was
discharged in the sloop, which now
lies a wreck on the beach. The apron
of the Olympic Boat Club house was
carried away. The Tropic Bird lost
an outside gangway.
On the beach near the bridge is a
half- rater. A launch ; was swept?
against the concrete bulkhead of the
Belvedere Hotel and sustained consid
erable damage. The yawl Spray was
lying, at Frank Bartletfs moorings in
the cove. - The rone chafed and parted,
the sloop being blown away, but for
tunately escaping much damage, as
she was caught at the plledriver near
the bridge to the lagoon. The, sloop
Sans -Souci, went. into the lagoon at the
close of last season, but her mfst wa's
unstepped and'she lay to a mooring in
the cove, standing the blow well.
" 'In the lagoon many evidences of the
Eouthweater are visible. The sloop
Merope is in the road at the head of
the lagoon. The â¢, sloop Halcyon was
driven , up on the beach, and the sloop
Cupid into Â¦ the â¢ marshJ- W. , Fliher'a
Rarely has so much havoc been
wrought among the pleasure craft of
San Francisco Bay as was done by
the storm of last week. The shores
of Sausalito, Tiburon-and Corte Ma
dera Creek tell an eloquent story of
the violence and destructive force of
the gale.
Broadside on the beach of the main
street of Tiburon is the big yawl Aca
pulco, formerly the schooner Dolphin
of the Vallejo Yacht and Boat Club.
The little sloop Venture was hauled
up on the beach at the time of the
storm, but the stays were knocked
from under her and she was battered
about. R. N. Whitney's little launch,
after losing everything except her en
gine, was thrown against the plank
walk leading to the Corinthian Club
house, where she formed an excellent
breakwater for the cottage that abuts
on the walk. Her coaming was bat
tered on* and a big hole stove in her,
but she can be repaired. E. F. Sagar's
sloop Edna, moored on the Emilie's
chain In front of the Corinthian
Club house, rode the storm out with
out damage.

N'EW YORK. March IS.â The New
York Yacht Club officials have replied
to the letter of Sir Thomas Lipton In
which the Irish Baronet asked if the
club would accept a challenge for a
race for the America's cup under the
new rule of measurement of the club.
Sir Thomas Lipton in asking if the club
would accept a challenge under the
hew rules practically asked the club to
bar the Reliance." Constitution and Co
lumbia from participating in future
races for the cup. These boats could
not be used as defenders, because the
present rules of the club limit the
draught of any boat to eighteen feet,
and these three draw 20 feet each.
It is understood from club members
who have a knowledge of what the
committee agreed upon that the latter
Intimated to Sir Thomas Upton that
the club does not cros3 a bridge until it
comes to it. and that it has no power
to say what It will do in the event of
a challenge being received and can
make no agreement with any one which
shall govern future contests.

him, while he walked two men to first.
He was replaced in the seventh by
Sample, who held the Chicagoans level.
Slagle, Chicago's center fielder, played

Chafes Sloat, the alleged cham
pion lightweight from Tennessee, was
pie for Jack Gray, who stowed him
away In two rounds. Sloat is a big,
awkward looking rube and the gallery
had all kinds of fun while he was
maneuvering about the ring. Jack
O'Brien of the south side won from
Joe Leahy after four rounds of good,
hard fighting. It was even up all the
time and both boys were going hard
when the gong tapped.
Hike Synfy, the terrible Turk, laid
George Murdock on the carpet in the
third round. Kid Parker had a tough
engagement with Dick Cullen, but fin
ally landed the money at the end of
the fourth spasm. Harry McCloud put
Manuel Torres to the floor with a
shower of hard ones in the second
round of their erigagement.
Bonar Wilt dropped Jack Augustine
In the second round with a vicious
right crofts to the jaw. , Up to that
time the fight was slow and uninter
esting. Dick Highland easily beat
Jack Brown, a newcomer, in four
rounds. The latter was game and will
ing to go. but. lacked experience and
did not understand how to hit in the
correct fashion.
The amateur boxing game is the real
thing os a money maker. That was
demonstrated at the new "Woodward's
Pavilion last night, when the San
Francisco Club's bouts drew about 9000
people, or something: like 56000, for the
box ofllce. There were ten bouts on the
card, and the show "broke up In -a
chorus of hisses and hoots that sur
passed anything that has ever been
heard here at a prizefight.
It happened after the last mill of the
evening had been decided. Owen Sul
livan, the big: youth from the' south
side, was pitted against Joe Long, the
veteran of many a battle. It so hap
pened that Long just beat Sullivan to a
pulp during those eventful four rounds,
and when Referee Greggains decided in
favor of Sullivan the gailery started in,
and soon the ground floor was assisting
it, in a chorus of hisses that is beyond
description.
Sullivan clearly demonstrated that he
does not know the fighting game. He
rushed around the ring like a mad bull,
while Long met him squarely every
time and punched him from head to
footâ so badly, in fact, that he was a
mass of blood, but still game. He did
not hit Long two effective blows during
the engagement, and was not entitled
to anything but the losers end of the
purse.
The next best bout on the card was
between Joe Larkin and Joe Podesta,
two lightweights. They slugged and
slugged till it looked as though both
must drop from sheer exhaustion, but
still they stayed the limit. Podesta was
given the decision.
Gus Koster won from Joe Stanley
after four slow and tedious rounds.
This decision did not please the multi
tude at all, and those in the gallery
were not slow to make known their
feelings toward the club and its referee.

FtifT punches, but the Australian only
smiled and said: "I could Uike those
launches ail eight."
"Oh. no you couldn't." said Britt,
"you won't be here all night."
Just then he landed on Heagert>'a

happy and says he will be happier still
when he puts his gloves up in front of

Uritt will be at his best next Friday
night.
Jimmy went through his usual
work at his gymnasium yesterday and
received a number of visitors. Many
of the?se cast their critical eyes over
the crack fighter's physique and were
pleased with his condition. There
Â¦will be no material change in Britt's
work until the middle of next week.
After the stirring and turbulent
times of Thursday at Corbett's camp
there was a lull yesterday. The lit
tle champion declared a holiday in
th^ afternoon. With his trainers he
wÂ«-nt to Sutro Baths and disported
in the big tank like a schoolboy. In
the evening he came into town with
his automobile and attended the ama

Britt weighed a shade over 132 pounds

to have him heavier, as they could then
work him hard without danger of over
training.

.The Thornton stakes at four miles,
which calls for endurance as well as
speed, will be the attraction at Oak
land this afternoon. At least five will
start. The clever handicap horse Ho
ratius with Powell up. will unquestion
ably be the favorite. Veterano Is a use
ful perfdYmer in heavy going and will
be piloted by Jack Martin. Mike Daly
will have a try for the rich prize with'
the three-year-old Sailor Knot, which
will be ridden by ,W. Daly. Rio Shan
non won this race last year and might
repeat. Jimmy Coffey said Buxton
would probably ride his horse. The
Way has not lived up to his Eastern
record, but might prove the surprise
to-day. A special boat will carry the
crowd home after the races.
KXTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
Little Crosswaite piloted two winners.
Hoceo and Gateway. The latter was as
good as 12 to 1 in the betting, and
until the last race belonged to the
maiden class.
Jimmy Coffey's Galanthus retired the
favorite, Mimo. from business in the
fifth, one of the best betting events of
the afternoon. Besides the two horses
mentioned. Reeves, Molto, Muresca and
Whiskers were all accorded support.
Roach went out in front with the first
choice and stayed there as long as
possible. Less than a furlong from the
judges Roach was compelled to draw
his whip and Buxton beat him out
rather easily with the Coffey entry, a
7 to 1 shot in the ring. Vanderbout
came from behind with Colonel Van.
leading Reeves out for show honors.
Muresca lacked staying qualities.
Crosswaite rode his second winner of
the day when he placed Tommy Lot
tridge's maiden Gateway across the
line first in the concluding mile sell
ing run. Twelve to one could be ob
tained about the green one. which beat
the favc/rite Anirad out less than a
length. Hulford cut out the running
for seven furlongs, when he tired, fin
ishing third.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Carelessness or overconndence on the
part of Mountain cost the black mare
Criss Cross the third race. Dell Foun
tain's Salto, the 9 to 10 favorite, did
not get away from the barrier any too
well, but worked his passage to the
front on the far turn. In the run home
Mountain, astride Criss Cross, went by
the favorite and at the end of j the
stand it looked shoes : to plates ' she
would land. But Mountain apparently
did not observe Crosswaite creeping up
on the inside with Hoceo and lost the
decision by a head. Five to one could
have been had about the winner. Dr.
Itowell's Harbor had many friends, but
the three-year-old retired early in the
struggle.
IIOCEO BY A HEAD.
Playing favorites was again a pre T
carious business, as Cassie W was the
one public choice to live up to expec
tations. The track, of course, being in
a muddy condition, left a loophole for
many excuses. The attendance was
good and betting brisk.
James Nealon's fillie Cassie W, a 2
to 1 favorite, captured the first event,
a five and a half furlong selling af
fair. Bonner had the leg up and, tak
ing matters quietly to the . stretch,
passed the tiring Dr. Sherman and
Amasa. winning easily by more than
a length. Dr. Sherman was as gooji
as 50 to 1 and took the place from
Amasa by a head. My Surprise showed
some speed, but failed 'to stay.-
Unless J. T. Sheehan mends his ways
and ceases indulging in so much rough
riding, he is apt to find himself* in
trouble before long. He had the mount
on Plrelia in the two-year-old dash
and, striking the stretch first, turned
wide, interfering badly with Knapp on
the favorite Saccharate and Escobosa,
the second choice. It worked the fa
vorite's downfall, for the filly was
downed a neck by J. Daly on Esco
bosa. Anaurus ran disappointingly.
There was nothing: unusual about
the sport at Oakland yesterday unless
if was the spectacular win of the mile
and fifty yard selling number by
Charley McCafferty's recent acquisi
tion, Idogo.
A* piper "virtuoso from Big Jim's
opium squad could scarcely figure the
brown gelding a chance on his preced
ing race, -.wheri\ he finished behind
Blackthorn, Decoy and Billy Moore.
Still, with' C. Smith replacing Bonner
in the saddle and 15 to l"in the betting
ring, h/s blazed a new path through
the heavy going and won, buck-jump
ing, from Rim Rock, another rusty
looking outsider, backed down from
20 to 12.- ..
For a time it looked as if it might
take a donkey engine, block and tackle
to haul In the- derelict 6 to. 5. favorite-
Mr. Dingle, but he eventually finished
In last position. ...

KEEPS THE NAILS IN SPLENDID TRIM.
The "Care of the Nails" is a subject m which every one should be interested, for it is rightly
taken as an open index of good breeding and character. Laxity in the care of the nails Indicates
slovenliness. Perfect grooming of the nails is often an important element in a favorable decision
when applying for a business position. -; 'Li V t. u u-
A simple manicuring should be given the nails at least once a week. The cuticle should be
pushed back with a flat pointed, (oar-shaped) orange stick. Soak the nails :n a bowl of warm,
soapy water for five minutes. Then cut the nails the proper shape, being careful to remove all hang- . .
nails. File carefully and rub in some cold cream or vaseline; this will prevent bnttleness. Re-
move it with a cloth and apply some manicure powder; rub briskly with a chamois polisher,
too high a polish is considered bad form. / ->V '* â¢ C : . u
' The almond shaping is preferred; oval at the delicate finger-tips and short at the sides.
This cutting and shaping of the nails can be perfectly done with The Gem Nail Clipper,-a complete
manicure set. For sale everywhere at 25c. â¢ . ,
tâ INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO USE^â
fiFM NATT HIPPER 'tk I
v
To use the Clipper press 'down firmly on the lever and release the lock by turning the
star. In using the Clipper always keep the lower jaw against the end of the finger, and, by sim-
ply changing the angle of presentation, cut the nail short or trim as desired.

that "The Gem" is the best Clipper upon the market. (

The Pacific Mail wharf is Jammed to the roof
from one end to the other of Its great length
with merchandise of all kinds, from peanut9
and preserved ginger to 6teel rails and hard
wood legs. In addition to these piled products
of-many kinds Is a string of. loaded freight cars
and the narrow lane left In the barricade of
bales and boxes Is constantly blocked by the
heavily laden trucks bearing away the stuff dis
charged from arriving steamers or bringing
cargo to fill outgoing liners' holds. The Sibe
ria sails Wednesday and will carry a cargo
weighing about 5S7OO tons. Of this fully half
rtlll has to be hauled to the ' wharf and ma
neuvered through that maze of piled up mer
chandise^ It has to be done and Captain
Thomas D. E. Wilson Is going 'to do it, but it
is one of the biggest jobs he ever tackled. The
freight still to arrive includes 1500 tons of bar
ley and 25,000 cases of canned salmon, all for
Japan.

The French ship Helene Blum, Cap

way here from the Old World since
the middle of last summer, came into
port yesterday looking considerably the
worse for wear. She left Leith July

her seventy-five days to round the
storm-swept headland. She was
smothered by salt green seas. She
was thrown on her beam ends. Her
sails were tattered and torn by the
fierce blasts and her main topmast
snapped off. Then she sprung a leak
and December I went limping Into
Valparaiso very much In need of re
pairs. Temporary repairs, costing
nearly $3000, were effected at the
South American port and January 10

Atlantic Tn:st Company Held Bo
spcrslblr for $40,000 for Recelr
cr*s Kxpcnses In Canal Case.
Jtidjjrr.ent against a creditor In a
foreclosure proceedirjc is one of th<Â»
freaks of the lav/, and In the case of
tho Wooclbridse Canal and Irrigation
Company the freak will cost the creri-
Itcr mortgagee, the Atlantic Trust
Company, about Sto.oco. according
to a decision handed down by United
State3 Circuit Judge Morrow yester
day.
The property of the canal company
was sold last year by order of the
United States Circuit Court in fore
closure proceedings in the suit brought
by the trust company. At the request
of the creditor the court had appoint
ed E. C. Chapman as receiver and
Chapman's report to the court showed
tint the price, $21,100. which the
canal property obtained at the court
sale, was about $40,000 short of pay
ing the co3ts and expenses of the re
ceivership. He thereupon brought
suit against th-? trust company to re
cover that sum.
Judge Morrow gave an oral decision
yesterday in *favor of Chapman. This
Judgment is believed to be final, for
all the matters in litigation concarn
ing the Vv'oodbridge Canal and .Irri
gation Company have been passed
upon by the United States Supreme
Court.

I Wheat and Other Grains.
j WHEATâ The foreign markets showed little
change. Chicago dropped 2>4c and the sentt
, mem there was still very bearish, with a good
' deal of talk about the t>oor demand for Flour ;
1 and the settlement of the Arsentine ! strike.
, which would be apt to increase the shipments
j from that country. Crop reports from Western
j Kansas and Oklahoma were gloomy*. There :
1 were no further rains in the Southwest and a
dust norm over Western Kansas was re
ported. Only a few points in the Southwest.
have been favored oy light rains and the crop
t Is flow being damaged. .
i The . private wires of Mitchell. Mulcahy &
j Cc from Chicago said: "The close waÂ» heavy
and the selling panicky. It was a heavy mar
ket throughout the day. but the weakness was
accentuated In the latter part by the heavy
(allure in the cctton market in New York.
' which was also supposed to be long on Cera
and Wheat in this market. Cables were steady.
Cash markets in the Southwest were dull and
orders from mills seemed to be withdrawn. The !
Modern Miller was bearish on the crop situa
tion. The whole situation to-nisht is nervous
and unsettled and the action to-morrow will
depend udom cables and the extent of (urther
liquidation 1>7 weak holders. It has. however,
had a good break, and on any further decline J
ought to be a purchase for a rally."
I In this market caih cratn was firmly held.
1 but -buyers, are keeping aloof and business U
i quiet. Futures are lower.

A. G. McADIE. District Forecaster.
CHICAGO. March IS. â Mysterious selling
pressure on a -large scale near the close of
j trading on the Board of Trade to-day was
only explained shortly before the final gong
sounded, the announcement being that the firm
of D. J. Sully & Co. had (ailed. Sully, the'
"Cotton King." acquired membership on the
Board of Trade only a few weeks ago. Con
siderable liquidation in the late trading to-day
was .said to be for his account.
The wheat market was already in the hands
of the bears before any tremor of the Sally 1
failure was felt. Immediately after the open- \
ins there had been a little firmness due to .
comparatively steady cables and to reports o(
dust storms in Kansas. Private advices also
stated that few places in Western Kansas had
received any moisture of consequence. Initial
quotationj on May were unchanged to %c
hieher at 94 Tic to 954c July was SfJ-^c
higher to Â«^c lower at 69^Â©^aÂ¦^^c to S9Tic.
Acting under the impression that the drouth
in the Southwest was not yet broken, many of
yesterday' s sellers began to buy wheat back.
From >-94c July rose to SI*&c. with only small
offerings on the market. Later the selling
became more pronounced and prices started
downward. The dwrllnln* tendency was ac
centuated by weakness at Kansas City and by
I a rumor that the strike in the Argentine re- j
public had been settled. Early buyers turned t
sellers and many prominent longs took, profits. J
There was also considerable selling (or the j
short account. The early bull influences seemed
to have wholly disappeared. It wag at this 1
Juncture that a prominent commission-house j
began executing selling orders for large quan- 1
titles of wheat. Vague rumor quickly con- \
nected the name of Sully, the cotton king,
with thl3 heavy selling. Definite announce
ment of Sully'e failure was not forthcoming,
however, until some little time later. Trading
was exceedingly brisk the last few minutes,
and* on each sale a lower price was recorded.
Tbe close was at the extreme low DOlnt. with
May 2%c lower at 92i4c and July 2S'a2*ic off
at S7c.
- Considerable strength was manifested ln the
I' corn pit early in the day and prices showed
a lair advance The closing was weak and near
the bottom. May down l$ic at 51&C July
closed with' a loss of 14c at 49t,c.
A strong cash situation and small receipts
maintained a firm tone in oats the greater
e part of the Â«ession. An easier tone s#t in near
the end. May Closing 4SfHc lower at 39%c.
Juiy closed with a net loss of at 3SKc.
Provisions were weak on continued selling
by commission houses. The selling was largely
in the way of liquidation, and was mainly the
result of the demand from that source. The :
close was at the low point of the day, with '
j May pork 374c, lard 174c and ribs 150174c ,

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Receipts of Potatoes were light, being less
than 1000 sacks, but the market had an easy
tone and prices of table kinds were lower, as
dealers were anxious to dispose of poor quality
offerings, which have been accumulating on
the wharves for some days. Onions were weak
I and the top quotation' was obtained only for
} selected lots. Offerings in. original packages
j consisted chiefly cf "sprouts." which were hard
to sell, even at the Inside rate. What few
Australians were left in first hands were offer
ing at $3 25Â©3 50 per cental.
Receipts ot Asparagus were light, be in*, less
1 than one-half the quantity received on the pre
ceding day. and as there was a fair Inquiry
for shipment on the Portland steamer prices
wtÂ»re ttrnur. Los Angeles Peas were easier
owing to the abundance and comparatively low
prices of the bay article. Receipts of Rhubarb
from the Growers' Association were light, but
the market was amply supplied with carried
over stock and several lots received from out
side growers were offered at a sharp decline.
Sales at the top quotation were rare, meet deal
ers being satisfied to clean up at cost. The
other vegetables were in moderate supply and
prices were unchanged. There were 52<J boxes
of Tomatcea and 50 bo*es of Chile Peppers re
ceived from Mexico by steamer.

Poultry and Game.
Trading In Poultry was quiet, as most retail
ers were well supplied with Western stock,
five cars of which have been marketed since
! Monday. Prices of dome-tic were well sus
j talned, as the receipts were very light owing
to the recent rain. Three cases of dressed
Turkeys came in and sold at 19-g22c. per

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The Butter market is now rÂ»r>orted in satis
factory shape for sellers. At the present ranÂ«e
of prices the goods are moving off very well.
and though supplies are ample there is no ac
cumulation. The tendency ln receipts, however,
is to increase, as usual at this time of the year.
Cheese 1* no weaker as far as choice grades
are concerned, but dealers are beginning to
{ complain of the abundance of old and inferior
stock, which cannot be moved at any price.
Quotations remain about the sam*.
The Eesr market is quiet and without par
ticular feature. It Is kept In a condition of
unrest and uncertainty by the operations of
speculators la Sonoma County, who are bidding
against one another to get supplies for cold
storage, basing their contracts on newspaper
quotations. This leads all parties concerned
to use their utmost endeavors to mold the
newspaper quotations this way and that to suit
their private purposes, and the result Is con
fusion. The quotations below represent the
San Francisco market, as previously stated.
Receipts were 59,300 lbs Butter, 1633 cases
Eggs and 41.500 lbs Cheese.

Receipts of Oranges were light and etocks
of choice lots showed considerable decrease,
but the market was dull as there was very
little doing in the shipping lice and the wants
of local buyers had been well satisfied dur
ing the active trading of the two preceding
days. There was not much Interest mani
fested in the auction sale and the bulk o(
the offerings were bousht . back by the man
agers of the auction company. Five cars'
were sold as follows: Extra fancy Redlands,
$1 2.VS2: ordinary fancy. 75c@$l 23; choice,

top quotation for extra fancy was obtained
only for a few boxes of" desirable sizes a
steamer arrived with 342 cases of Mexican
Limes and prices were lower, as the next
steamer is expected to bring heavier sup
plies. Pineapples were selling at an' advance.

Nczv York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. March IS.â The cotton futures
market c-Dened weak at an advance of 5 points
on April, but generally unchanged to 17 points
lower on further boar pressure and liquidation,
in of better cables than exoected and
smaller estimates for the day's receipts. There
was continued pressure against the market,
and wbile. during the afternoon there were
frequent sharD rallies, prices cradually went
down Â«nd down.
Toward 2 o"clock. when margin Drices are
made up. May was selling around 14.80 cents
This re:>n-sw5t(?<i a decline since the hleh
point or only a fevr days ago of about 1S5
points, or nearly $9 25 a bale. Tills evidently
was mom than the bullish interests cduld
finance, asd just before 2 o'clock the suspen
sion of D. J. Sully & Co was announced Im
mediately the market vras plunged into the
i wll'lfst scene of demoralization. Brokers wÂ»rÂ«
ra^iic-ftricken. aod cotton came oourlnc out"
with and without orders. The market went
down as thoush there was no bottom to it.
No one ceeiried to care cbout buyine but
evrrj' oae wanted to nell. Thâ¬- big bear*, who
ever they have been, a little over a week ago
may have boujeht some cotton, but they were
carrful not to buy too actively, and before the
dr 1 line was checked even May had sold down
to 12.C3 centÂ« and July to 12.80 cents. This
wan a le*s. as compared with last night's
closing price?, of from 250 to 260 points or
about $12 50 a bale. TJie decline from the
high point reached on the close of last week
1 was about 4 cents a sound, or about $20 a
"ule.
Just before tbe close covering helped prices
somewhat, and the market was finally ateady
at a net decline of 62 to 190 points, with May
closing at 13.37 cents and July at 13.3S cents
Sales were estimated at 1.5C0.00O bales.
In spite of the recent ssvere declines and re
ports concerning the Jarre line held by the
Bully interests, it may br> eaid that the su*-
I pension came as more or less of a surprise to
the ceneral , trade. The Sully holdings are
variously estimated. Local traders rtcently
have detected the existence of a large interest
in May. which has been estimated at around
300.000 bale", and the bear drives in to-day's
j d>vclcrmejits is thought to have represented
the efforts of shorts to force the- lessening of
the bull crip on the May option, which, if
continued, must bave resulted seriously ; to
shorts.

"Harriet's Honeymoon," the, play in
which Mary Mannering is to open a two
weeks' engagement at the Columbia
Theater nexfMonday evening, is said
to be one of the best laughmakers pro
duced,this season. 'It was written by
L<eo Ditrichstein, author of "Are You a
Mason?" and he has been Â¦ successful
in producing mirth-provoking situa
tions in a consecutive and culminative
story.
An extra stupid German police in
spector is the chief mover in the fun
making arid he mixes thlng^s up in a
â¢fearful way. Miss Mannering portrays
the heroine, a young American woman
on her honeymoon trip in the father
land. She is said-to be supported by
the most excellent company r she .has
ever :had and it is understood, that her
management has | provided an elabor
ate and 'picturesque setting for the
three acts in which the comedy is
placed.- Â¦-.;. ; ;' ......
During Miss : Mannering's engage

IROCjrOTS CLUB MEETS.â At a meeting of
the Irrxjucis C!ub held in Pythian Cant* last
eier.in a resolution was adoritwl voicing the
crr^ltion r-1 the organization to the pinpored
oifiira.r,cÂ«- rmbibitirs: Ftr*Â»t meeting?.
titude of profound and hopeless melan
choly while his lawyers tried to con
vince the court that he was a
physical and mental wreck, and that
unless he were admitted at once to bail
he would become incurably, insane
forthwith or be carried out of Los An
geles-County's new jail a corpse.
- The millionaire was Colonel Grif
fith-J. Griffith, formerly Park Com
missioner of Los Angeles, now under
sentence of the Superior Court in that
city for shooting his wife, Christina
Griffith, .for which offense he- has been
sentenced to serve two years at San
Quentin and pay a fine of $5000. Pend
ing the decision of his appeal, which
cannot be heard In the Supreme Court
for more than a year, his attorneys had
sued out a writ of habeas corpus before
Justice McFarland for the purpose of
getting their client out on bail. Griffith
was brought into co.urt by Sheriff W.
A. White of Los Angeles County. His
petition was presented and argued by
ex-Judge J. F. McKinley, John T. Jones
and Earl Rogers. It was opposed by
the Los. Angeles District Attorney, J.
D. Fredericks. After hearing all that
was to be said on each side the court
denied the petition and sent Convict
Griffith back to his quarters in the Los
Angeles jail.
AFFIDAVITS GALORE.
Attorney . Jones opened Â¦ the case for
the petitioner with the reading of a
batch of affidavits from y well-known
Los Angeles physicians. These experts
were called at the trial Mn- the attempt
of the defense to substantiate a. ple& of
insanity, but the jury refused to accept
their theory. They now deposed that
the month -passed since the trial had
produced grave changes for the worse
in the # condition of the prisoner, that he
was rapidly breaking down both , phy
sically and mentally, showing signs of
acute delusional insanity, and liable if
confined further in the jail to become
either a maniac or a dead man.
This was the burden of all the affida
vits, for they were as much alike as
peas in a pod. They were sworn, to by
Drs. E. M. Griffith, J. H. Crawford, H.
G. Bralnard, Robert V. Day, E. M. But
ler, Granville MacGowan and F. C.
Shurtliff. All had known the prisoner
for many years and all were convinced
that the only thing that could save hia
mind and perhaps his life ; was.. to get
him out of Jail and into a sanitarium, .
where he could have abundant open-air
exercise. Besides the affidavits â¢ of. the
doctors Jones read that of A. W. Marsh,'
a detective, who declared that he had
been watching Griffith for weeks and
believed him to be sinking swiftly into
a state of complete collapse.
WHEX DOCTORS DISAGREE.
Jcmes rested. This gave District At
torney Fredericks a turn at the affi
davit business, and he at once pro
ceeded to square himself by reading
the depositions of Drs. George W.
Campbell, E. G. Goodman, J. W. True
worthy and W. W. Hitchcock. They
had known Griffith just as long as had
their professional brethren, .and -.they
were just. as positive in their beliefs.
They, declared that the prisoner was
in prime condition, both mentally and
physically, and that neither his life nor
his mind would be -endangered by
imprisonment in the Los. Angeles jail.
This belief was fortified by their ac
counts of a visit which all four of the
affiants had paid to Griffith in his cell
A millionaire convicted by. twelve of
his peers of a murderous assault sat in
the Supreme Court yesterday afternoon
guarded by a Sheriff, but nevertheless
chatting and laughing gayly with his
friends. He seemed. in the pink of phy
sical condition. His 'face, serene and
full-blooded, was as fresh and uncloud
ed as that of a child. Apparently" no
trouble cast its shadow. over his mind.
This was before the court opened. A
moment later, when the venerable Jus
tice McFarland had taken his seat upon
the bench, the prisoner sank into an at-

Accused of Stealing Tools.
John St. John was booked at the
City Prison yesterday afternoon on
four charges of petty larceny. The
police say that he has a mania for
stealing carpenters' tools and they
had been looking for him for some
time.

day before yesterday. The prisoner
had been stripped to the buff and the
medical men had gone over him as if
he had been a prizefighter on the eve
of the contest of his life. The only
unfavorable symptom manifested was
Griffith's own statement that since the
trial he had lost twenty pounds. There
upon they had weighed him and, find
ing that he pulled down the scales to
157 pounds, they duly certified to. the
court that for a man of 5 feet 6 Inches
that weight did not indicate the prox
imity of dissolution^ Finally they de
clared that he , was occupying a sunny
and well ventilated cell, 22x11 feet in
its dimensions, in the magnificent Jail
which is the pride of all citizens of
Los Angeles. * , â¢
Sheriff White's affidavit was also
read. Griffith is evidently his star
boarder at the jail. The prisoner, be
sides tenanting the best cell, is exempt
ed from eating the common fare pro
vided for the other jailbirds. The jail
kitchen is at his. disposal and he may
have the choicest viands cooked there
by the first chef of- the city. As a-re
sult of this style of living, the Sheriff
deposed, Griffith was always cheerful
and light-hearted. He made no com
plaints against his confinement. "In
fact, he had repeatedly thanked White
for providing him with such pleasant
surroundings.
WRIT DISMISSED. ~
After all these and other affidavits
had been read the lawyers talked for
an hour. Numerous "points" were
made on.- each side. The 'petitioner's
attorneys, however, based their argu
ment chiefly on the critical illness of
their client, while the District Attor
ney argued that the application for bail
should have been first presented on
its merits to Judge Smith, who tried
the case at Los Angeles, and that noth
ing- could justify Justice McFarland
in interfering : except' imminent danger
to the prisoner's life.
The aged Justice took this view. "If
you had made out a clear case," he
said, deciding the matter off-hand, "I
should admit this man to ball, but It
does not appear that he is In peril.
All the testimony is from- experts and
it is evenly balanced.- The petition is
denied and the writ is discharged."
The alleged physical wreck spent sev
eral hours in company with the Sheriff

Fund to Replace Memorial Window.
A most unexpected but welcome
gift of $10 was recently received at
the Maria Kip Orphanage from a
at the Hollenbeck Hotel. Los
Angeles, who prevents special thanks
by signing himself "One intere?ted in
your work.'* . This will be made the
beginning of a special fund. to replace
the memorial window that was de
stroyed during the heavy storm of the
10th inst.. when so much damage was
done in San Francisco. The window
â¢was placed over the altar in the cha
pel by the late Mrs. Joseph Eastland
in memory of her little daughter,
â¢whose life ended so tragically. It is
earnestly hoped that others interested
in the orphanage may add to the sum
and make it possible in the near fu
ture for' the empty space to be again
made beautiful.
The early morning worshipers at St.
Dominic's Church yesterday were wit
nesses of an interesting ceremony, per
