- DAWSON, Jan. 21.â Damage to prop
erty amounting to $120,000 was done by
a fire .early this -morning. The entire
Klondike capital' was threatened for- an
hour, and it was twice that time before
the fire was 1 got under control.
Two 'warehouses, those of the Joseph
Ladue Company: and thef Ames Mer
cantile Company, were burned to the
ground. Other buildings- were near by
and it was only by the hardest kind of
work in the coldest of weather that
they were saved.
The thermometer registered 42 de
grees below zero . when the firemen
hurried out in answer to the general
alarm. It was so excessively cold that
time and again the firemen had their
clothes frozen solid, and their garments
had to be broken with .the blades of
axes before they could be pulled off
to, ; be replaced by . others. Spectators
of 'the fire who stood as close as they
dared had their ears frozen.
\ Besides a large line of ; general mer

stored supply, of sixty, tons of hams im

Chancellor Announces That Unless
Revenue Returns Increase Expendi
tures Must Be Economized.
LONDCJ^.' Jan. 21.â Chancellor of the
Exchequer Austen Chamberlain, reply
ing to-night to .*the toast, 'â¢â¢His Maj
esty's Ministers," at a banquet of the
Carpenters' Company, said that unless
a great change occurred within the
next few months in the revenue returns
there would be little prospect of realiz
ing the budget anticipations, and that
he was afraid he would not be able
to propose a remission of taxes during
this session of Parliament. He explain
ed that the Somaliland campaign had
proved to be much more costly than
had been anticipated and that the pur
chase of equipment of the two Chilean
battleships had been another unexpect
ed financial drain. He hoped it -would
not be necessary to increase the indebt
edness of the state, but said there
would be special need for economy in
the national expenditures for several
years to come.
An unfortunate circumstance, from a
police standpoint, is the fact that Mrs.
Wilson is utterly unable to Identify her
assailant. She said last night that the
two points she noticed about him were
that he was well built and wore a
double-breasted square-cut coat >of
dark hue. She was unable to say
whether the clothing was blue or black.
She gained an Impression that the
trousers were lighter than the coat and
waistcoat.
Over his face, she said, he wore a
black silk handkerchief, bound around
the brows. She did not think there
â¢were any eyeholes in the handkermhief,
although it is inconceivable that one
could perform the actions that the rob
ber went through without use of the
eyes. -Mrs. .Wilson is positive that the
handkerchief covered the face above
the eyes and frankly acknowledges
that if the man were arrested she
would not be able to Identify him by
his face. She remembers that he had
dark hair and that he was "well
dressed. Other than that she has no
description.
Mrs. Wilson and her husband came
to this city from New York two months
ago and have occupied the premises at
100S% Guerrero street since the second
day of their arrival. The husband is
employed in a wholesale house on San
some, street 'as an accountant.
Detective Tim Bailey was detailed on
the case as quickly as it was reported
and last night Detective Jack Fitzger
ald was sent out in the hope . that ; his
wide knowledge of the Mission crixni-
person of the adventurous robber that
invaded the home of Mrs. Agnes Wil
son, at 1C0SH Guerrero street, at noon
yesterday. The perpetrator of the dar
ing crime covered his tracks so com
pletely that it is doubtful whether the
police will ever be able to secure him.
The robbery was both daring and un
precedented. After buying some vege
tables from a Chinese peddler Mrs.
Wilson climbed the steps to her apart
ments. As she entered the kitchen,
with her apron full of her purchases,
she noticed that the room was darker
than usual. Instinctively she drew
back, but before she could collect hex
thoughts a man was grasping her by
the threat and arm. She had no op
portunity to scream and was so fright
ened by the attack that she made no
outcry.
The robber said he ; wanted all her
money. She told him she. had no
money. He slapped her with. an open
hand on her cheek and said, "Give me
all you have." She pointed to a
drawer of a dressing-case, and from it
the robber took a purse containing
510 65. He dumped the contents of the
purse out on the dresser and selected
only the money for his spoils.
"You have more money than that,"
said the robber and again grabbed the
woman. She was too frightened to
scream and was subjected to a desper
ate pressure on her arms, which now
bear bruises. Then the robber tore
open her wrapper and searched for
hidden money. When he had finished
his quest tÂ» pulled down a heavy
Turkish curtain that separated the
Kitchen from the dining-room, wrapped
It around the head of Mrs. Wilson and
threw her to the floor. When she re
covered from fright she went to
the back steps of the flat and screamed.
Dozens of persons hastened to her res
cue. But the robber had escaped.
Doubtless he went down the front
stairs and emerged at the front en
trance. ! Mrs. Wilson is positive that
this was the method of his escape, be
cause he passed her in the doorway
connecting the kitchen and dining
room, after she had been wrapped in
the curtain-
John B. Murphy, the Idaho cattle de
tective, who passed through here to
day en route to Omaha, said:
â¢ : I worked on the Terry case for a
few days, more through professional
interest than fcr any other reason. I
am convinced that, whoever the man
Â¦was, he was decoyed to the desert and
there murdered. I also think that
there is, cr was, an organized gang
that made a business of getting pros
pective land buyers into their clutches
and then putting them ouAof the way."*
In the inside pocket of the waistcoat
vrorn by the dead man was found a let
ter which may throw some light on the
trajcedj*. It bore no â¢ date, but was
Â¦written on a letterhead of a millinery
store at T*S Valencia street. San Fran
i cisco, and was signed "Belle." A part
of a torn card, bearing the words "La
\ Belle Millinery." but no address, was
also found in the pocket.
CONTEXTS OF THE LETTER.
The letter was addressed "Dear
John," and was couched in the most
endearing terms. It thanked "John"
; for a present recently received, and
also referred to several other gifts that
the addressee had apparently bought for
her, including a silk petticoat. Other
wise there is nothing in the note that
<-an supply a clew to the Identity of
the mysterious dead man.
From the texture of the clothing
found on and rear the body it is evi
dent that the man was well to do, at
least, although no money or other val
uables were found. Silk underwear
and a. white shirt which he had worn
â¢were embroidered with the initials "J.
B. T." The man had a!so worn a
white, stiff collar. AH the linen bore a
laundry mark that has not been de
ciphered as yet.
ORGANIZED GANG AT WORK.
Th** generally accepted theory now
i* that Terry, if that was the name of
the deceased, was enticed to the desert
tinder the pretense of looking at some
land that had been ofrered~to'"ETmr ~EXT-~
fience has been obtained showing that
a man of his description passed through
PocatelJo laSt July, and said that he
Â¦was goicg to look at a sheep ranch.

ger. Neither has been seen in Poca
tello since that time.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 21.â Slowly
data is coming forth that may event
ually solve the mystery connected with
the finding o-f the body of an apparent
ly wealthv man on the desert twenty
miles north cf Market Lane, Idaho.
The peculiar circumstances connected
*-.".h the discovery of the remains con
vinced the authorities that the man
Â¦was the \-:ctim cf a crime., and that
he had been lured to that out of the
vay fjiot that he might be murdered
and plundered.
At first it Â»vas reported that three
envelopes found in the coat fee had
worn were addressed to J. B. Terry,
but th^ envelopes were fmpty, the let
ters that they had contained having
disappeared. Now it develops that two
of the letters have been found. One of
them was evidently written by a San
Francisco woman and the other was
mailed at Cleveland. Ohio. The first
gives a faint clew, the second nothing
that f>.e effleers can work on.
Special DiÂ«rÂ»trb to The Call
SALT LAKE, Utah. Jan. 28.â "Mark
Hanna is not a candidate for the
Presidential nomination this ye3r. You
can say this as an absolute fact.
Hanna will be a candidate for the nom
ination in 1903; this Is also a fact. Sen
ator Hanna will under no circum
stances allow his name to go before
the Republican convention this year.
Neither can they 'Roosevelt' him. and
if any such attempt is made he will
balk and he will balk hard. I make
these assertions- from my own personal
knowledge and* you can quote me as
saying so."
This was the declaration to-night
made by J. H. Shievely. chairman of
the Republican State Committee of
Washington and Insurance Commis
sioner of that State. Shievely Is here
with the party of United States Sena
tor John Mitchell of Oregon. Shievely
is an intimate friend of Senator Har.r.a
and he is deemed to be in the Ohio
man's confidence. With Hanna and.
Forakex. Shievely stumped tbc State
of Ohio for McKinley at the request of
the National Republican Committee
some years ago. He is regarded a* one
of the few raÂ»rÂ» â¢*"fio "share the full con
fidence of the Ohio Senator. Shievely
said: â¢
"All this talk about Senator Hanna
being a candidate for the Presidency
this year is nonsense. I know this to
be a fact. Hanna would not accept the
nomination this time under any con
sideration. He realizes that Roosevelt
is the logical candidate, and he would
be the last man on earth to oppose the
choice of the rank and file of the Re
publican party. Hanna has the Presi
dential ambition, however, beyond a
doubt. He is ready and willing to make
the race for his party when the oppor
tunity seems ripe. That will be In
1903 and not before. The fact that he
has allowed a few of his Intimate
friends tqjmow of thi3 has given rise
to the story that he is seeking quietly
the nomination this yearâ a story that
reaily has no foundation and Is untrue.
"I repeat: Hanna would not accept
the nomination to succeed Roosevelt
this time. In 130S the third term tradi
tion will bar Roosevelt and Hanna wiD
be a candidate."
Sj>Â«nÂ»l Dispatch to The Ca'.J
""Wjlth imports of a billion dollars for
1903, being $26,000,000 above the highest
mark previously reached, and with ex
ports amounting to J1.4S4.66S.127. nearly
$20,000,000 greater than the total for any
previous year, we j are unable to per
ceive the necessity for the abandon
ment of protection in order that our
foreign trade may be increased. With
a foreign trade aggregating two and

growing, it would seem that we are

OPPOSED TO RECTPROCITY
"In annual meeting assembled, we
reaffirm the position taken by the Tar
iff League'adopted on January 15, 1903,
and declare:
> "That reciprocity in competitive pro
ducts is unsound in principle, pernicious
in practice and condemned by expe
rience. It is contrary alike to the na
tional policy of protection, to the fair
treatment of domestic producers and
to friendly relations with foreign coun
tries.
"It is neither ethical nor economical.
; since it seeks to benefit some Industries
i by the sacrifice of others. Reciprocity
In competitive products is the policy
of favoritism. It tends to array indus-
I try against industry, section against
i section at home and to foment com
| mercial retaliation and plant antagon-
Ism abroad. The true American policy
Is^the srotection of all the opportuni
ties and possibilities of the American
\ market for American enterprises, and
! fair, equal trade treatment for all other
countries."
"It may be that considerations of
sehUmenf*br^eÂ¥eh*oXS party- expediency
seem to party managers wiser guides
In some particular . emergency than
rigid adherence H.o the national policy
of protection. It may be that a party
organization can take that view and
act on it without Injury to itself: but
such a course can no more be pursued
by an organization dedicated to the
cause of protection than an 'individual
can depart from, the line of rectitude
in order to- benefit others.

proposed pugilistic -contest "between
Tom Sharkey and Jack Munroe in all
probability will be decided before the
Criterion Athletic Club. The battle
ground was to have been chosen to
day, but it was again deferred;. The
reason for this was that the Criterion
Club's bid, which was the best one,
could not be accepted because the club
did not comply with the requirement of
sending a certified check for $2000 with
the proposal. The managers of the
men "arc in communication with the
club, and the organization's match
maker says the money will be sent, if
at all, in a few days. '
In the meantime the fighters will
continue training,"because the articles
stipulate that the battle must be de
cided before March 1. It also is under
stood that one of the Philadelphia
clubs will make an offer for the en
counter. It may not be considered,
because the articles say the match
must be for more than six rounds. In
Philadelphia only six-round bouts are
permitted. However, if- the Boston
club 'does not forward the necessary
deposit the papers may be modified so
as to allow the men to have it out at

The extent (o which the letting of
moors and forests has become recog
nized as a regular source of income
to lord and laird alike in the highlands
may be judged from the increase in
the number of deer forests now annual
ly let. Twenty years ago there were
ninety recognized forests. A recent re
report from the. Crofter Commission
showed 109 of these forests. To-day
there are 150. Shootings and forests,
which let for upward of Â£400 or Â£500 a"
year may be counted by hundreds. In
the two countries of Argyll and Inver
ness alone there are a*dozen forests
whose rentals average Â£2000. Here the
cost a day. will work out at over Â£40,
exclusive of wages of attendants. The
tendency of price is constantly upward.
Captain Hey wood Lofidsdale will be in
terested to know that.Coignafearn, the
40,000 acres of which he rented last year
for Â£2000, was originally let by the
Mackintosh of the 30's for Â£30, with
Â£5 return as "luck penny."
The foregoing is typical of the rise in
rents which has resulted ' from ; the
eager competition for ' forests and
moors. Invershie, when it was good
enough to afford a bag of seventy-five
brace to one mun and a dog, the shoot
er, armed with only an -old flintlock,
fetched Â£50; now it is a four figure
shooting. George A. Cooper is paying
Â£5500 for his forest, Â£4700 to Sir G.
Macpherson-Grant for his -share, of
Glenfeshe and Â£800 to the Mackintosh
for his portion. M. Achilles Fould has
Invermark at Â£3850; William Weir,
Achanacarry for Â£2000; Lord Burton,
Glenquoich for Â£3022; Frank Bibby,
Mamore at . $2500. e For Invercauld,
Â£5000 for ..; the season Is asked. F.or
Â£3000 less Runecht is let. At about
Â£2000 many moors and forests are now
being used. Then, to this must be add
ed cost of traveling, Â£1 a week for
each of the/ gillies, Â£1 a week for
ponies, beaters and drivers, of whom
there may be, thirty or forty, at 4 shil
lings a day. Dogs cost from Â£5 to
twenty times*. that figure; guns from Â£7
to Â£70. The game shot may, with luck,
be sold for 'half its " cost per head. The
deer which has cost Â£50 to kill may be
sold to a dealer for its e carcass for Â£ 3.

bezzled. $31, 000, although it is , said

Warr last spring was a candidate for
Mayor on the reform ticket. He is in
jail in default /at bond.
Mayrone had been his owner In. the
days of slavery and came upon Guesno
one day when he was whittling a pipe
and asked him why he didn't make
them to sell. The old-style corncob had
long been an institution of the South
ern negro, but not of a merchantable
article. The Interrogatory of Mayrone
set Guesno thinking, with the result
that in the fall of 1S67, at a Mechanics'
and Agricultural Association fair of the
State of Louisiana, held in New Or
leans, he exhibited a number of pipes,"
all of which had ready sale. One ob
jectionable feature was that the bowl
burned out very quickly. G^sno con
sulted a well-known chemist, with the
result that a harmless chemical com
position was applied which infinitely
prolonged the life of the corncob and
which to-day is being used in Its man
ufacture. In the days of Gueano it was
said he received as high as $25 for a
pipe which to-day can be bought for a
nickel."â Philadelphia Press.
Barring the '"I. D." clay for the
grown men and the cigarette for the
rising generation, there are few things I
so popular with the tobacco smoking
fraternity as the corncob pipe. And the
history of the corncob is interesting
telling. In its evolution from manufac
ture by hand up until to-day, that
thousands are turned out every work- I
ing hour, there are interesting epochs.
In the manufacturing district along J
the Delaware River there is a night
watchman, a colored man, who back in
the days "befo* de wa' " was a slave in
Louisiana. He was born and reared in ,
slavery. Recently he was smoking a
corncob contentedly, reflectively and
reminlscently. As he puffed he asked
the question:
"Who was the first white man to
make a corncob pipe? Do you know?"
"No."
Then the negro told this Btory: _
"It was Andrew Jackson, President of
the United States. A man by the name
of St. Armand was a soldier under
Jackson when he was major general at
New Orleans. At the time that Jack
son used bales of cotton for protecting
his army he was 'found smoking a corn
cob and said he made it himself. This
was when Colonel Thornton of the Brit
ish regulars made his attack on Jack
son."
A relative of the speaker's, Henry
Guesno. who went to New York City
about nineteen months ago, was the
first man 'to make corncob pipes for
sale: It was In 1867, when he was em
ployed by a man named Mayrone in
New Orleans.

Japan will be ready. Some of the
strongest men in the empire are work
ing for a peaceful termination of the
difficulty, the main feature being a
breakdown of the negotiations, but
they are meeting with opposition on
the ground that the propositions which
are -acceptable to Japan do not pre
serve Russian pride. The Listok says
it expects the crisis to end in an un
derstanding in the form of a treaty
supplementary to the Russo-Japanese
convention regarding Korea.

lieves that the unfortunate tone of the

New York to London, tend to create
irritation. He deprecates the attempt

yellow peri!," and says:
"The whole history of Japan since
the. restoration shows her aim and pur
pose to take her place on the plane of
European civilization and become a
world power, politically and commer

advocate 'Asia for the Asiatics.' "

; Forget Your Stomach and YouTl Hare
a Santa Clans Face.
HOW TO DO IT.
If there is one thing more than all
others that will give a man a forlorn
; and friendless appearance and make
,' him morbid and "cranky" and dis-
' agreeable, that thing is dyspepsia. It
I makes one forget his friends and be-
! come morose and irritable. He is bo
â¢ wrapped up in his own misery that he
1 is inconsiderate of every one else. Re-
lieved of this terrible and depressing
i ailment, he again becomes a good fel-
: low and a man among men.
5 Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are be-
I yond question the most effective and
! popular remedy ever offered to the
i sufferers of this terrible disease. The
! thousands and thousands of cures they
i have brought about and the enormous
l Increase of their sales fully attest the
truth of this statement.
They are, above all. a natural rem-
edy. They possess exactly the same
I properties that the gastric juices and
i other digestive fluids of the stomach
| possess and they actually do the diges-
! tive work of the stomach and enable
j that organ to rest and recuperate and
; become sound and well. They act in
J a mild, natuwl manner and cause no
; disturbance in the digestive organs.
i They prevent any fermentation of the
' food, which causes sour stomach. In
fact, under their influence the sub-
ject forgets that he has a stomach
and his resulting cheerfulness presents
a great contrast to his former dejec-
j tion.
I Millions of boxes of Stuart's Dys-
j pepsia Tablets are sold annually and
they are but in .the dawn of their
popularity. Every mail brings Ietter3
of thanksgiving from grateful ones
who have been cured of "this terrible
disease. The following is one of hun-
dreds received each week:
Rev. J. R. Hoag of Wymore. Nebr..
writes: "For six years I have been
troubled with dyspepsia. Last fall I.
became very much alarmed at some
symptoms of heart trouble and came
to believe there was a sympathetic re-
lation between the two- diseases, or
rather, that the stomach trouble was
the cause of the heart disturbances. I
hit upon Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
for a remedy and invested a dollar and
a half for three boxes, which lasted
me three months, and I can eat any
kind of food I want and have a good,
vigorous appetite. Although I am 77
year9 old. I now feel perfectly well
j and without being requested by any
one I make this statement as a com-
pliment to the virtues of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablete."
â¢ Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are fort
sale by all druggists at 50 centa a box.

WASHINGTON. Jan. Zl.â The Senate
Committee on Philippines gave a hear
ing to-day on Senator Frye's bill ex
tending the coastwise trade of the
United States to the Philippines, so all
commerce between the islands and ths
United States shall be carried by Amer-
A. P. Loriiie, president of the
Plymouth Cordage Company of Plym
outh, Mass.. said American vessels
should be given the business between
the United States and the Philippine
Islands as soon as the vessels are pre
pared to take care of It. He asked that
the time the bill takes effect be ex
tended to April 11. 1903. wh^gn the Span
ish ships will lose their right, under
the treaty with Spain, to engage in the
Philippine trude on a par with Ameri
can ships. He thought by that time
the" competition between American
vessels would be sufficient to carry on
the trade without resulting in a mate
rial advance in freight rates. He said
he was willing the bill should pass if
it did not result in an increase of more
than ?5 per cÂ»zt over the present
'freight rates.
It was brought out that the Eastern
cordage manufacturers fear the pas
sage of the bill would build up the
twine manufacturing industry on the
coast and wreck Eastern industries. It
also developed that the present freight
rates on Manila hemp amount to about
4<5 cents per hundred pounds, and it
was estimated by manufacturers that
the freight rates, fcy the passage of the
bill, would be advanced fully Jl per 1QQ
pounds. UndÂ»r these conditions, they
represented, the trzde In hemp would
return to London, where tt centered
prior to the opening of Philippine
port*.

vision of Wells-Fargo & Co. The in
formation received from the conductor
of the train as it sped on its way north
was very brief and misleading in that
it inferred that the through treasure
box as well as the local box in the
messenger's car had been captured by
the thieves. - .
Before, the "Limited" had arrived
here Detectives Thacker and White of
the express company, and Peter Lewin,
a Southern Pacific officer, had started
south to the scene of the robbery,
where they were instructed to join with
the authorities of that section of the
road in a hunt for the criminal. The
railroad company and the express com
pany were meanwhile telegraphing or
ders south to officers there to tonic
north and join the pursuing party. It
was after 10 o'clock in the morning be
fore the officials at this end of the
Southern Pacific Company began to t ?
coive anything like a detailed account
of the affair, and not until after the
"Limited" had arrived and the expr-^
company's messenger. Timothy Sulli
van, made his report of the affair.
MESSENGER SULLIVAN'S STORY.
According to his story, he had occa
sion to enter the baggage-car just as
the train was pulling out of Sun Luis
Obispo.
"Wlicn I returned to the. express car
later, ' he taid, "I noticed the cold con
dition of the car, and. glancing around,
I was surprised to find that the fide
door, which had been barred when we
entered San Luis Obispo, was partly
open. It suddenly flashed through my
mind that some one had been in the
oar during my absence and my v.-orst
Mclntoch criticized Captain Roberts'
actions severely, and said Roberts knew
many places where .the Clallam could
have been beached, even without" her
engines, if he had used seamanship and
the sails of the Clallam were properly
equipped. He and another witness gave
instances of lifeboats and equipment
having been borrowed by local steam
ers for the purpose of passing inspec
tion. ,
Captain Collister, inspector of hulls,
testified to his inspection of the steam
er. He said she was well constructed
and properly equipped.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 21.â Captain
Mclntoch, a boatman who had charge
of the lifeboat of the Clallam which
was wrecked with the body of Miss
Harris in it, gave testimony before the
Coroner's inquest to-day that the boat
was not properly equipped. If it had
been it should have lived after being
lowered. The cap of the plug was not
attached and the boat had filled
through the plug hole and swamped.
Unattached rowlocks and other arti
cles found showed that she had not
capsized.

SAN JOSE, Jan. 21.â Superintendent
Wilder of the Southern Pacific coait
line was in San Jose to-day. In an in
terview he stated he had been informed
that the Wells-Fargo safe had -been
stolen from the northbound coast line
limited early this morning. He said
that the train was not stopped, accord
ing to his advices, but that the robbers
had managed to enter the car and
throw the safe off. It was not missed
until some little time after.
Detectives from San Francisco passed
through San Jose at 9:20 this morning,
bound for the sc^ne of the robbery.
Official In Control of Coast Line
Learns of Robbery.
SUPERINTENDENT ADVISED.
"It appears that the messengers on
the 'Limited' of late hnva frequently
had to perform the service of baggage
man in addition to their own duties,
and this extra labor has demanded
their presence in both cars at different
times. The hobos became aware of this
fact and no dobut appreciated the op
portunity offered them to get into the
express car while the messenger was
absent in the adjoining one. It is oftr
theory that they have been lying
around San Luis Obispo for several
days watching their chanced Wednes
.day night they saw Sullivan enter the
baggage car as the train started up and
they quickly boarded the express car
by the forward platform. Then they
waited until the train had got well
under way and proceeded to force the
car door. Perhaps only one man did
the trick, but generally two work to
gether. Once inside the car they ex
perienced little difficulty in opening the
side door, which is always bolted from
the inside, and grabbing what they
Messenger Sullivan's theory of the
robbery is shared by the detectives of
the express and the railroad company.
It is thought that it was committed by
tramps, with which that part of the
Southern Pacific Company is at present
Infested. Of late hobos have been get
ting on the iron beams of freight box
cars in that part of the State. After
the trains get in motion they swing out
on to the side of the cars, where they
smash the seals and the locks, and
then, with the aid of an Iron bar, they
gradually work the door open until one
of -^the men is able to crawl up into the
car. He then assists a partner to join
him. Once in the car the hobos pick
out whatever freight they consider val
uable to them and throw it out of the
door. When they have got enough
they wait until the, train starts up a
grade and quietly alight and go back
after their plunder.
It is believed by the railroad detec
tives and the officials of both the ex
press company and the railroad that
the hobos that have been robbing the
freight trains are implicated in the
robbery of the baggage, car of the
"Limited." In fact, the theory is
borne out by the finding later of the
looted treasure box near the track.
"We have been having a lot of trou
ble with these hobos down in Southern
California lately," said one of the de
tectives of the Southeri/- Pacific Com
pany yesterday, '"and there Is little
doubt that two or more of them had
planned this affair, expecting, of
course, to get the through box, which
generally is rich with wealth. It is
very probable that these fellows had
been watching a chance to get into the
express' car of the â¢Limited' for some
time and their opportunity came Wed
nesday night.
GET BOX AND ESCAPE:
TRAMPS ARE SUSPECTED.
"The safe, which contained, about
$400, weighed about 200 pounds. There
were some papers in the safe, b,ut they
could be of no value to any person.
I am sure that the safe was on the ex
press car after we left San Luis
Obispo, as I had occasion to go to
it to place some valuables in it. As
soon as I saw that the chain which
acts as a guard to the door, was out
of place I looked round and was thun
derstruck to find the safe missing. I
have been -with the Wells-Fargo Ex
press Company fifteen years and this
is my first experience, as also my first
loss.'-' â¢ .
fears were realized when I saw that
my small express box was missing. It
was evident that a robbery had bee u
committed, and I hurried to the for
ward, part of the car, where th-s Â«loor
was also partly open. The battero'l
lock and the splintered door sill readily
suggested the way the robber had
gained an entrance to the car.
"Hastening back to the rear cars. I
summoned the conductor and told him
of the robbery and he prepared a tele
gram, which was filed at the next stop
and sent forward to the southbound
train. Later we reported the affair
briefly to the officials at this end of the
line."
i Strangely, few of the passengers on.
the Limited, among whom were Carle
ton Crane, local agent of the Xew
York Central road, and William B.
Jerome, general Western passenger
agent of the same company, knew of
the robbery until the train was ap
proaching this city yesterday morn
ing. When it occurred they were all
asleep and there being no stop or gen
eral disturbance they dreamed silent
ly on until the morning.
There was considerable satisfaction
evinced by the express company's of
ficials in this city when they learned
that the local box instead of the
through box had been taken by the
robbers. The former simply contained
money and orders sent from Los An
geles, while the "through" box usually
contains a large amount of treasure
shipped from the New Orleans end o*
the line. T.he box which the robbers
neglected to take Wednesday night is
reported to have contained many
thousand dollars and valuables that
could have been easily converted into
coin by the robbers.
Captain Crowley, head of the South
ern Pacific detective bureau, left for
the south on last evening's train and
will supervise the investigation of the
robbery at San Luis Obispo in so far
as it concerns the railroad company
anfl will, of course, co-operate with
Detective Thacker of the express com
pany in plans to capture the offend
ers.
DETECTIVES ON THE SCENE.
"That the robber or robbers boarded
the train at San Luis Obispo is also
suggested in the message received here
to-day that two mail pouches were
found Just this side of San Luis Obispo
at a point known as Hathaway avenue-
It is but a few minutes*. run to there
and it is an opinion accepted by the
officials of the company that the rob
bers'threw out these sacks under some
previous understanding -with their pals
that the mail would be picked up.**
The rifled express box, according to
the information received by the rail
road officials, was found by a pursu
ing party near Thyle station, which is
thirteen miles north of San Luis Obis
po. One message stated that it had
apparently been broken open with
some Iron instrument. Another stated
that a large number of express and
railroad money orders., the latter re
mittances to the Southern Pacific
Company, were found lying on the
ground near the broken box and that
in the latter was discovered a dia
mond, which may have been wrenched
from the setting of a ring worn by
the robber or more probably escaped
from an express package.
The first reports from the scene of
the robbery to the effect that the rob
bers had got away with $80,000 were
emphatically denied by the express
company's officials, who claim that
the most the local box contained in
cash and currency was a sum less
than 1700. The express orders and
remittance taga of the railroad com
pany called for sums aggregating
about % 15.0 00. They were, however,
of no value to any one. for an at
tempt to cash them would result in
immediate arrest. At the same time
the express authorities admit that it
is not the custom to make public the
losses by robbery, for it is believed
that publicity often encourages others
to commit similar crimes.
LOSSES ARE EXAGGERATED.
supposed was the richer treasure box.
they threw it out of the car. A few
miles north of San Luis Obispo the
train encounters a grade and the speed
naturally slackens, which gave them a
chance to escape from the car and re
turn to the place where the box was
thrown out.
One of his subordinates stated that
the value of the booty secured by the
thieves will not exceed $1500, and that
estimate includes articles which cannot
be disposed of at their full value by the
robbers. What the big through safes,
which were sealed at New Orleans,
contain is not known to any of the
company's officials along the line, and
it is in them that the reaUy large
amounts are always carried if there be
ar>y large sums on the train.
Information received by the Los An
geles officers is tÂ« the effect that the
condition of the rifir-d sa fe when found
indicated that it had been blown open
with nitro-clyeerine in a manner simi
lar to that adopted by bank robbers,
and this leads to the belief that the
same class of crooks who robbed the
Sawtelle bank a week ago may have
been implicated in the Job, because it
The Jurisdiction of the Los Angeles
office dots not extend bfcyond Santa
Barbara, and up to that point the of
ficials here know just what was in the
safe. It was asserted positively thi?
evening by Assistant Superintendent
William Pridham that the value of the
treasure secured by the robl>ers was
not large; that it was not worth taking
the chance to secure and he positively
denied the rumor that upward of
$50,009 was contained in the strong
box.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21. â The Los
Angeles officials of Wells. Fargo & Co.
have been informed that it was the
safe locked here and containing . the
Los Angroles remittances to San Fran
cisco that was thrown off a northbound
train north of San Luis Obispo this
morning, and was also used by the
messenger as a waysafe in which were
placed suoh packages as he picked up
en rout*.
Two pouches of mail were found near
the track a mile north of this city
which it is believed the hobos stole
from the depot while the pouch mail
was being transferred from the regular
mail car which stops here and returns
to Los Angelas on No. 1
BOOTY IS NOT LARGE.
The local officers -were out early and
worked hard all day cm every clew
that could be found between Paso Ro
bles and San Luis Obippo. It is be
lieved that most or all of the guilty
persons are under arrest. The work
appears to be that of some former rail
road man in connection with a gang
Of tramcs. A man came to San Luis
Obispo early yesterday morning and
his actions caused suspicion. At 3
o'clock he was arrested when attempt
ing to board a train for Guadalupe.
He would not give his name or any
information concerning himself, but
was identifled by a band of hobos as
having purchased a hat from one of
them. The officers found the robber's
hat near the place where the robbery
was committed. The man arrested
bought a new hat in San Luis Obispo
and tried to sell and then to give away
the hat obtained from the hobos.
The safe was opened by an explo
sive at Cuesta. Section tools were
found near the safe. This showed that
the burglar who dumped out the safe
had accomplices. Several hobo? are
under arrest and it is believed they
are guilty.
SAX LUIS OBISPO, Jan. 2Lâ The
most daring robbery ever accomplished
in this part of the State was reported
jn this city at 1 o'clock yesterday morn
ins. The Wells-Fargo way eafe on
express train No. 9 had been tumbled
out at the mouth of tunnel No. 1 at
the summit of the Cuesta grade and

About eighteen months ago there was
organized in this vicinity the Farmers*
Relief Association, modeled somewhat
along the lines of trades unions, and
embodying features, still alive, of those ,
farmers' organizations that 'Tose in a ;
night to vanish with the sun." The
central idea, of the organization was to
perfect a more perfect home, although
not invading any of its sacred preroga
tives. Its founder. James H. English,
held that It in each school district the
families could be brought closer in
touch, the society of the district har
monized, welded and made congenial,
that the problem would solve itself.
The society has had a wonderful
growth. Seven counties in the section
are " now organized. - Throughout the
Central West Inquiries come to the na
tional officers for a better knowledge
of its workins3. , There is no politics
whatever countenanced In it.

a few miles south of this city, Is a
practical illustration, and there are
many ; such over, the -section of the re
markable hold which 1 the new plan has

There is a local lodge of the order, in
whfch all residents are entitled to
membership. An executive committee, :
of which the teacher is chairman, gov
erns the social life of the community.
All -parties, entertainments and social
gatherings are arranged, always with
a purpose in view, and no one is barred
from the gatherings.^ Both old and
young are members of the committee.

service Is excellent, and at night the
ypung'men and young ladies pass
many a pleasant, hour in exchanging
courtesies and perhaps arranging for a
new home at Yuletide. It is surprising
to* note 'the uses for which the tele
phone" is called into play.: Perhaps the
hogs have broken. out or the cow wan
dered away, and the romp of miles is
displaced by the telephone. Borrowing
among the people is arranged by

self the defendant in a suit for $5000
on account of the most absurd of de
cisions. The new immigration law de
clares that ah immigrant must submit
to an educational test in his native
language before he is' allowed to land.
Not long ago a mate on a ship was ar
rested for smuggling. When he -was
released he was ordered to submit to
the test or be expelled from the coun
try. It was found that his father was
a German and his mother a native of
Egypt. He was born in. Alexandria.
It was decided, therefore, that his na
tive language was Greek, since Greece
is the Kuropean . country nearest to
Egypt. He failed to pass an exam

diminishing greatly the maximum
temperature reached during explo

"I shall not prosecute McGibbons,"
said Sternberg, "because I believe he
is mentally irresponsible and is a klep
tomaniac."
The police coincide with Sternberg's
idea that their prisoner is not morally
responsible for his actions, and they
will not proceed against McGibbons
provided the loser of. the jewelry does
not take steps in that direction. Mc-
Gibbons' home is with his mother at
677 Twenty-fifth street.
McGibbons entered the Sternberg
house Tuesday afternoon during the
family's absence and ransacked the
rooms, stealing two diamond earrings,
a gold watch, a necklace and a child's
bank. The jewelry he pawned In San
Francisco for $5 at a Chinese shop.
The young man was suspected and
was arrested by Detective Shorey this
morning. Questioning by the police
forced a confession which included an
admission from McGibbons that he had
also stolen two gold watches from the
Sternberg residence a week before
Tuesday's crime was committed.
Kleptomania is the excuse offered for
Albert McGibbons, 24 years old, who

autopsy upon the body of Edward J.

The Government of Morocco thought
it was very hardly treated when it was
compelled to build this lighthouse. The
other Governments had requested Mo
rocco to build it as an aid to naviga
tion, but Morocco bluntly refused.
Diplomatic pressure was . i then
brought to bear, and the leading com
mercial nations at length induced the
Sultan to build a lighthouse at Capo
Spartel. The contract was given to a
French firm, and the result is a fine
and solid piece of stone work.
The lighthouse is nateworthy for the
remarkable manner. in which it is sup
ported. The agreement with .Morocco
was that if the Sultan would build a
lighthouse the other nations would at
tend to its maintenance.
Among the estimates of the State
Department for the current year is
found the sum of $350 as our "annual
proportion of the expenses of Cape
Spartel light, on the coast of Morocco,

"The charge that I accepted a bribe
frpm Fisher is utterly false. No money
ever passed between us."
Fisher in his own behalf denied that
he had qffered Pickett any money." He
denied -being on particularly [ friendly
terms with him and swore that | their
relations were really rather strained.
"As to receiving news of the jury's de
liberations, .he had not' been favored
any more ' than . other people. . Â¦ . .
â¢On the Deputy District Attorney's
showing Justice Edgar decided to dis
miss the venire of forty talesmen- that
had been summoned by > Pickett and
called for another of thirty v men, re
turnable at 10 o'clock to-morrÂ«iw. This
SAYS CHARGE IS FALSE.
"The card from Mr. Orr was passed
out while a glass of water was being
given to one of the jurymen," said
Pickett. "It had nothing whatever to
do with the case.* As to being 'unduly
friendly with Fisher, that is untrue,
because our relation are just the re
verse. Fisher got hot at me last night
when I met him in West Berkeley be
cause I would not summons some men
that | he wanted on the jury. I had
summoned' three men and. when they
objected to serving on the jury I let
them go, but Fisher wanted them any
way. r/-.vj:> :'Â¦".Â¦ .'Â¦ . Â¦
Attorney Walsh backed up his affida
vit with a statement on the witness
stand which went further to implicate
Fisher and Pickett. He said he noticed
that they were unduly friendly and on
January 1 14, the last day of Fisher's
trial for battery upon M. C. Woodruff,
he saw the defendant pass $5 to Pick
ett. He was unwilling to swear, how
ever, that Pickett took the money. A
spectator at the trial also told him, he
said, that a card had been passed out
of the room in which the jury was de
liberating and it was his opinion that
it gave information to Fisher as to
how the. jury stood.
Pickett was then given a chance to
explain himself on the. 'witness stand
and made some admissions that show
that juries in Berkeley are treated with
a good deal of freedom. * He admitted
that a card had been passed out of the
jury room by C. A." Orr, but declared
it to be merely a message to Orr 'a wife
concerning the time when he would be
home for dinner.
Not only does Attorney Walsh charge
Fisher with offering money to Pickett,
but he also declares that there is a
friendly relation between them that
has manifested itself in a number of
ways, particularly in regard to the an
nouncement of the jury's verdict in 'the
recent battery case against Fisher be
fore Justice Edgar knew of it. and the
passing of notes from the juryroom
that were said to convey messages as
to the proceedings to the defendant.
The whole thing is"- summed up in
an affidavit Attorney Walsh presented
in challenging the panel when Fisher's
trial for disturbing the peace of E. E.
Newton at a rummage sale came up
in the Justice's court this mornine.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
OAKLAND, Jan. 21. â After a quar
rel with his wife, W. D. Franz, pro
prietor of the Haywards Villa Hotel,
disappeared on January 8 and has not
been located.
Franz and his spouse quarreled be
cause she objected to his frequent
duck hunting expeditions, and after
the altercation Franz walked out of
the hotel. He returned about 3
o'clock on the morning of the Sth of
January and gathered up his personal
effects, including about $2000 in coin,
and, hiring a horse and buggy from
a livery stable, started in the direction
of Oakland. Later the rig was re
turned to the stable by a stranger,
and up to date nothing has been
heard from the missing man.

After being saved from the peniten
tiary by marrying the woman whom he
robbed, William E. Barnes, a sales
man, landed to-day, for the fourth time
since last* May, in the city prison. This
time the charge of grand larceny is
again Tegistered against Barnes, the
specific act being the alleged theft of
a horse and buggy, owned by Dr. Will
lam S. Porter.
Barnes, the charge runs, took the
team from in front of the physician's
residence, 970 Grove street, this morn
ing. Dr. Porter missed his vehicle, no
tified the police, and this afternoon it
was recovered in Hagar's Stables, at
Alden. Hagar's description of the man
who left it there fitted Barnes to a dot.
Detective Qulgley found his man across
the street from the stable in a saloon,
where the much-arrested salesman had
pawned Dr. Porter's medicine *ag for
liquor.
Barnes was arrested last May on
complaint of Mrs. Annie Hughes, his
landlady, and charged with disturbing
her peace. A month later he was again
arrested and accused of stealing a lot
of jewelry and money from Mrs.
Hughes. He was held for trial, but
while waiting in the County Jail,
Barnes so played on Mrs. Hughes'
sympathies that she married him. That
blocked prosecution. Barnes was dis
charged, but kept out of jail only a
month, the next arrest following in
September, when he cashed a worthless
check for a small amount and went to
the city prison for ninety days.-
Mrs. Barnes sued her husband for a
divorce, but during his last stay in jail
she relented. On Christmas day Barnes
was again discharged, and celebrated
his release by inducing his wife to dis
miss her complaint. Less than a month
of freedom is to Barnes' credit this
trip.
Dr. Porter has sworn to a complaint
charging Barnes with grand larceny.
The. Information charging W. A. Mc-
Kowen with the embezzlement of uni
versity funds was filed by District At
torney Allen to-day, and it Is probable
McKowen -will plead guilty- in the
morning, waive all technicalities and
ask that he be sentenced immediately.
He has never expressed other desire
than that he might be allowed to plead
g^iilty to the charge against '- ' n. and
refused to-day to agree to a postpone
ment of the case in the event his at
torney was not able to be present.
The information charges him with
the embezzlement of $3515 from the
Regents of the University of Califor
nia. The maximum penalty for this
one offense Is ten years, which, with
credits, would result in a six and a half
year sentence. Other charges, how
ever, can be filed.
To-morrow Is arraignment day In the
criminal department, and McKowen
will be brought before Judge Hall In
the morning.

- The specimen was first seen protrud
ing from the cliff from which it was
afterward extracted. The workmen ex
cavating for it came in contact with
the remains of numerous other fossil
animals in a fairly good state of pres
ervation, but no scientific man of suf
ficient knowledge has yet been found
to classify them.
An important feature of the discov
ery is that South America has never
been known previously to furnish any
specimens of these prehistoric Silurians,
and a new field of scientific investiga
tion and discovery seems to have thus
been opened. Professor John C Mer
riam, professor of palaeontology at the
university, believes that the new fossil
beds may. yield specimens of immense
value to science.
In a letter, to President Wheeler of
the University of California from W.
H. Wright, head of the Lick Observa
tory expedition now in Chile, particu
lars are given of the recent discovery
of a perfect specimen of the ichthyo
saurus in a cliff near Coqulmbo, Chile.
It is .now In the possession of the
French Scientific Commission, which is
examining the fossil beds ot Chile, but
efforts will be made, to secure the spec
imen for the university.

Captain Gibbons of the ship General
Gordon, lying at anchor at Long
Wharf, had a fierce midnight encoun
ter with a burglar in the cabin of his
ship last night. His entire head is
bandaged to-day as a result of the in
juries.
Unarmed, Captain Gibbons grappled
with the man in the dark and received
a terrible beating from a sandbag or
club. The burglar escaped.
Captain Gibbons had spent the eve
ning in San Francisco with a friend
and returned on the last boat. He got
off at the depot at the end of the mole,
walked down the wharf to his ship and
had been asleep a short time when he
was awakened by some one moving
about his room. After inquiring who it
was, he got up and encountered a man,
and a fierce struggle took place be
tween them. The burglar beat the cap
tain to the floor and made his escape.
He took with him $46 he had found in
the captain's pockets and his gold
watch and chain.
The crew was aroused by the noise
of the struggle and the first mate
threw a pair of shackles at the fleeing
man that made a dent in tRe wood
work of the ship. The steward ran on
deck with a carving knife and almost
stabbed the mate. Meanwhile the cap
tain lay wallowing in his gore in the
cabin. His skull was laid bare and his
â¢face cut by the weapon, but he is not
dangerously hurt.

ly led to believe that it was he because
hf- was a German and excited."
The carmen employed on the Union
street line who claimed that they saw
a man resembling Blaise near Russian
Hill on the night of the murder, and
the carmen who also saw a man whom
they said resembled Soeder standing
under a lamp post at the corner of
Union and Taylor streets, were exam
ined by the police yesterday.
Their statements were discarded by
the police as vague and useless.
Detective Thomas Gibson said last
night that he did not care whether he
found any one who saw Soeder and
Blaise together after they left the Mex
ican restaurant on Broadway. "I will
be ready nest Wednesday, when the
case comes up in the Police Court, to
produce enough evidence to convict the
accused man. I have several little
points which I will spring that will be
eye openers. I have enough evidence
against Soeder to hang him without the
missing link, which we have sought so
hard to get. After he had killed his
brother-in-law Soeder went to his room
on Jackson street and changed the gray
suit he wore for the black one in which
he appeared when he went down to the
O. K. Saloon on Pacific street. He did
not go right into the dance hall on his
arrival at the saloon, but stood under
the archway which leads from the
dance hall int j the saloon and nodded
to Theresa King and another woman In
the place. His object in doing this was
to furnish himself with an alibi, in the
event that he came under the suspicion
of the police. He went out and then
returned to the saloon again and talked
with one of the girls. His attempt to
form an alibi was cunningly planned,
but we have enough evidence to break
it down.
"I find that Blaise and his murderer
did not approach from the north the
place where his body was found, but
walked up the hill on Taylor street
from the south, that is. from Broad
way. The man who dealt Blaise the
death blow walked on his right side,
and when they had reached the lonely
spot under the cliff in the cut, the mur
derer stabbed the victim in the neck."
CANNOT IDENTIFY SOEDER.
Captain Martin refused to discuss
this new and particularly valuable
piece of evidence. The statement
comes from the police, however, that it
wjll do much toward the conviction of
Soeder.
The police are in possession of evi
dence that Joseph Blaise did not know
that Leon Soeder was to be a benefi
ciary In the insurance policies taken out
on his life. He believed that the 56000
policy in the Pacific Mutual Life Insur
ance Company was payable to his wife.
It has been discovered that the $7000
policy applied for in the Hartford In
surance Company was payable to Leon
Soeder unknown to Blaise.
When the two men went to the insur
ance office In this city Soeder told
Blaise that the entire policies would be
made out in the name of Mrs. Blaise
and they were made out that way. A
few days later Soeder induced Blaise
to accompany him to the office of the
insurance companj^â He explained that
it would be necessary for them to go
to the office to see that the policies
were properly issued. On this second
visit Soeder informed the insurance
people that Blaise desired to change one
of the $3000 policies, making It payable
to Leon Soeder.
The Insurance people, suspecting
nothing, allowed the change to be made
as Soeder directed. The police say
this evidence did not come from the in
surance people, but from an outsider
who knew of the taking out of the poli
cies.

Two Republican aspirants for the
favor of the Republican Convention are
now in the field, and of course both
hail from Marin County. B. B. Mar
tinelli and E. C. Chapman are the can
didates. The latter returned from
Washington, D. C, recently. It is re
ported that he was advised by Califor
nia statesmen at the national capital to
enttr the contest for legislative honors.
It is gossip in political camps that
Judge Angellotti of the State Supreme
Court, who is recognized as a power In
Marin County, is somewhat partial to
Mr. Martinelli's cause. Mr. Chapman
also has the support of influential
friends. It is probable that the nomi
nation of either will be acceptable to
the Republicans of Contra Costa
County. â¢
The counties of Marin and Contra
Costa comprise the Ninth Senatorial
District under the apportionment â¢ of
1900. The district was formerly known
as the Eleventh. This year it is Marin
County's turn to name .the Republican
nominee. As a rule a good Republican
nomination is equivalent to an election.
Contra Costa had the privilege of se
lecting the nominee at the last election
for State Senator and put forward
Charles M- Belshaw. His Democratic
opponent was James H. "Wilkins of Ma
rin County. Belshaw received in Ma
rin 1234 and in Contra Costa 20S3 votes,
a total of 331". Wilkins secured in
Marin 1396, and in Contra Costa 1616
votes, a total of 3012. At the election
four years prior to the Bel3haw-Wil
kins contest General John H. Dickin
son of Marin, Republican nominee, won
out. 'ii s '^ : Â£-2.
It is said that State Senator E. I.
"Wolfe is an active aspirant for the
favor of the convention. Charles M.
Shortridge of Santa Clara is ambitious
to serve the State in Congress, and it
would not surprise the politicians to
see him in the fight. Colonel George H.
Peppy, president of the Union League
Club, has many friends in the district
who are advising him to enter the con
test for Republican leadership. The list
of aspirants will increase, rather than
diminish as the campaign progresses'.
San Mateo County may come forward
with a formidable candidate. That
region of country between the metropo
lis and San Jose is the home of states
men, and it is well understood that
Congress is the place for statesmen to
shine. It i? every-day talk in the dis
trict that Mr. Wynn is a one-termer.
CONGRESSIONAL ASPIRANTS.
There are no indication* at the pres
ent time that fusion propositions will
be accepted hereafter by representa
tives of the Union Labor party, who
have been taught by object lessens in
practical politics that fusion gives thf
offlces to the Democratic party and the
glory to the worklngmen.
There is no lack of aspirants for the
Republican nomination in the Fifth.
The good crop of candidates signifies
confidence in party success at the polls.
Some time ago it was ccrmmon rumor
in political circles that Arthur G. Fislc
had the inside position" in the race for
the Republican nomination. His sub
sequent appointment to the office of
Postmaster eliminated his candidacy
for Congress.
The district embraces all that por
tion of San Francisco not included in
the Fourth Congressional District, to
gether with the counties of San Mateo
and Santa Clara. The Legislature, In
order to strengthen the Republican po
sition in the Fourth District and make
Julius Kahn's campaign work some
what lighter, detached two of the solid
Republican Assembly districts from
the Fifth and placed them in the
Fourth Congressional District. It is
said that the changes made in com
mittee room were not understood in
thÂ«* Legislature until the apportion
ment measure had passed both houses
nnd gone to the executive for approval.
According to election tables, the Fifth
was left safely Republican in a
straightaway contest between the two
old parties.
WARY OF FUSION".
There will be an interesting contest
this year in the Fifth Congressional
District. Under the leadership of
Eugene F. Loud the Republicans won
control of the district and retained
possession of the works for many
years. In .the campaign of 1902 a
fusion of the Union Labor and Demo
cratic forces of the district was ef
fected by political strategy, and
"William J. "Wynn. the fusion nominee,
defeated the Republican candidate. It
is gossip in the political camps that the
Republicans will regain the lost
ground at the next general election.
The evening's entertainment closed
with a dance and the affair was voted
one of the most successful ever held,
rvery one bearing in mind that those
present honored the memory of a gal
lar.t eentlexxum and soldier-priest.
To prove that the pontoon bridge was
perfectly erected, the Columbia Park
Boys" Club marched over it, headed by
their band. Then the bridge was
taken down in half the time that It had
consuru.--cl in its erection.
Part two of the programme consisted
of various pleasing military tactics and
drills. The First Rrgiment of the Na
tional Guard, under direction of Colo
nel Thomas O'Neil, gave a military ex
hibition and v-as followed by an intri
cate company drill by the members of
Company A. League of the Cross Ca
dete. The cadets paraded under com
mand of Captain William C. Hopper,
his aids being First Lieutenant P. H.
McCarthy and Second Lieutenant
George G. Thompson. The cadets
moved through the drill with remark
able precision and evoked hearty
plaudit3 from the vast audience.
Company G of the First Regiment of
the National Guard gave one of the
prettiest guard mounts ever witnessed
in the city. To the strains of the mili
tary band of the regiment, the picked
men marched on to the floor of the Pa
vilion under command of Captain W.
L. Wall. Every detail of the guard
mount was gone through with accu
racy, even to the inspection of rifles
and sidearms and the guardsmen pre
sented a natty appearance that won
th*> approval of the audience.
The Columbia Park Boys' Club, un
der command of Major Sydney S.
P^ixotto, turned out in three compa
nies for the memorial benefit, accom
panied by a brass band and drum ami
fife corps. The little fellows were on
their mettle and they challenged com
parison with their elders in military
appearance. The boys gave every de
tail of a dro=s parade in a manner that
caused the most flattering comment.
An exhibition of pontoon bridge
building by a squad of Company G of
the First Regiment of the National
Guard made the hit of the evening.
Under command of Captain Walter S.
Kelly, v.hose aids were First Lieuten
ant John J. O'Keefe and Second Lieu
tenant A. McColloch, the guardsmen
erected a pontoon bridge over an imag
inary river. They rushed around like
beavers hauling: and carrying logs,
ropes ard other implements and put
ting: them in place. In ten minutes the
r^ri'ige v.as completed and when the
stars and stripes were nailed to the top
of the bridge a storm of applause
swopt through the Pavilion.
The grand military entertainment,
Â¦ hand concert and ball, given last even
ing at the Mechanics' Pavilion for the
! benefit of the fund in memory of the
j Rev. Father W*. D. McKinnon, who
j died in the Philippines while serving in
i the army, v.as a complete success.
Under the auspices of the Catholic
societies of San Francisco, the keenest
' interest was aroused in every section
| of the city, with the result that last
,: night's entertainment was witnessed
t by thousands, the Pavilion being
I crowded to its capacity.
The first portion of the programme
j consisted of a pleasing concert given
! by the First Regiment Infantry Band
of the National Guard, under the direc
tion of Leader George W. Hollister and
the band of the First Regiment League
of the Cross Cadets, Lieutenant Ernest
j "Williams conducting.
The identity of the deceased was es
tablished by a membership card and
Â»Â»vera! receipts from Stablemen's
dnSoa No. S760 of this city. Frank
ppst. night stableman at Goldberg.
Bowen & Co.'s stable, said last night
that Kirschfeld had been employed
ther 10 four cr five years. He began
drinking #o excess and was discharged
r few cays ago. He has acted queerly
rtteently and. according to Post, seemed
to be troubled with some mental dis
order.
The tragedy occurred shortly after
<:23 o'clock, a few: minutes after the
train had left the Cliff House terminus
cf th<* road. The engine was in charge
of Engineer S. Burr Smith and Fire
man Joe l^a Fortune. As the train
vts rounding a sharp curve both of
the men in the cab saw a prc-strate
form lyinp across the track about twen-
Ty-five feet ahead. Smith immediately
applied the emergency brakes, but not
before the engine ar.d cars passed over
tie body. The remains were removed
from beneath a rear truck, and it was
found that in addition to the body be
ing terribly macgled the head had been
severed from it. The head was found
eÂ«-veraJ feet distant, alongside the rails.
La Fortune, the fireman, says he saw
ibe man raise his head from the north
ra!U where he "was lying, glance in the
direction of the approaching: train and
then settle himself on the track, await
!t:k hi* fa.te. Engineer Smith corrobo
rates the statement of his fireman. He
declares that he plainly savr the unfor
tunate steady himself in anticipation
of the shock.
Oeorge G. Kirschfeld, a* stableman.
formerly employed by Goldberg. Bowen
& Ccl, erd>d his life yesterday after
noon by deliberately lying across the
track of the California-street steam
line of the United Railroads at a pvrint
about half a mile from Lands End and
awaitir.g the approach of the train, be
neath the wheels cf which he rr.et in

Hiss Pearl Landers was hostess at a"
charming dinner last night at her home
on Octavia street In honor of the
muchly feted Miss duff and John C.
Wilson, her handsome fiance. CWhy
shouldn't the groom-to-be have a few
nice things said about him?)
Miss Landers is by grace of nature a
charming hostess, chic, vivacious and
clever, and her affairs always go off
with a zest. Daffodils, so popular now
at the first breath of spring, were used
for the table, with dainty yellow
shades.
The dance of the Gayety Club at the
Pomeroy home last night was one of
the "gayest" of the season. Distinctly
a young folks' affair, there -was an ab
sence of that bane of the ballroom, the
solemn wallflower./
The figures of the cotillon were ar
ranged with the forethought of fun
making and the attemptswere decided
ly not in vain; the favors for the fig
ures tvere^ original and distinctive,
which is something Xo be desired in our
too imitative day. Miss Powroy gives
promise of being one of the cleverest
young hostesses in the city. And there
are rather a few who have acquired the
art. And art it is.

-
| TO the iÂ«d!tor of the San Francisco Br-
| â¢ am'ir.er: Havir.s discovered a new
! remedy which I believe will re volution -
; Isp the practice of medlelse. I must earn-
I ask that you assist me In its Intro-
j ducticn by announcing: a free distrtbu-
: tk>n from a newspaper office.
I want the public to know the trutH â
: kr:ovr it as I kr.ow it.
I believe there is a cure for ever?- di*-
; ease â I believe t'iat huniaa life can bÂ»
| prolonged â I beli-ve thr;* people Â«hou!4
| dip only from old age. and I also believe
; and know that zay Paw Paw reinedr icut
: not cr.l" relieve rnvc-h suffering, but add
; nxasj- years ta the aver.i^e life.
In my opinion dyspepsia and indigÂ»Â«-
Â¦ tion are the cause cf most ailment!*. In-
digestion mear3 nervousr.*?s. nlerpless-
| nÂ»Â«s. Impure b!ood. catarrh, sluirgish
; liver, kidney ard heart affections. " Nf>
| person can be happy â no person can see
\ the beauties of life and enjoy Its p!?as-
i tires, who suffers from any form of
| stomach trouble.
An eminent actor called my attention
I to the WOlMtaCjrnl benÂ«f t he had darived
j from eatins the Paw Paw fruit, telling
t me that it hatl vns.de almost a new stom-
| ach for him. I began to experiment
I with this frail and found it to be a most
i powerful aid to digestion.
I have taker. thÂ» medicinal quaJltie* of
; this fruit and combined it with other
! medicaments and havÂ» made a prepara-
| tion which is called "MUNTOXS PAW
PAW.'
I cannot recommend this remedy ton
j highly "for all forms of Indigestion and
; nervousness. This remedy also act*'
I wonderfully well on the liver, blood and
[ kidneys, but I believe ita greatest office
| is In its marvelous effect upon the stom-
; ach acd ctrves. It is really a nerve food
| and vitallzer. :'Â¦* .':
It sives exhilaration without intoxica-
i tion. It does what whisky nor beer can-
f not do. It relieves the nerve tension. It
j stimulates every fiber and puts irtta act-
i ive force every tissue of the body. It
j lifts one into the altitude of hope and
| holds him there. It is a bridge th3t en-
| ables the weak and sickly to cross dan-
j gerous places. It f*eds and nourishes
I the nerves, so that tne blood corpuscles
| will be constantly revitalized, and the
[ losses of the vital forces will be almost
j imperceptible. In other words, it will
supply a sufficient quantity of life mat-
ter to take the place of the waste.
-Instead of irritating the nerves and
stomach it soothes and . strengthens
them.
Almost every human being some tim->.
requires a stimulant. XOT AN ALCO-
j HOLIC STIMULANT, not a stimulant
j that will buoy him up for a moment and
j then cast him down to lower depths of
I depression, but a. stimulant that will
j give an abiding strength and lasting
j force.
My Paw Paw aids the stomach to di-
gest hearty foods, and to make good,
rich blood, which again in tarn, strength-
ens the nerve*, vitalizing all the tissues,
and soon produces muscle, tissue, bone.
It la my opinion that the clergymen In
thi3 country could do no greater service
to the cause of temperance than to ad-
vocate the general use of my Paw Paw.
for by its use drunkenness would be
lessened and the morals acd health cf
the community greatly improved.
A wife whose husband is addicted ia
â¢Ir inking can do nothing better for her-
self or family than to get a bottle of this
Pav.- Paw. and whenever her husband
feels the need of a tonic give him a ta-
blespoonfur of Paw Paw. She will find
that he will soon lose all cravings for
strong drinks â that his appetite will
soon become natural; that his nervous-
ness and longing for excitements will
j disappear, and he will be perfectly satis-
i f.ed without alcoholic stimulants and
harmful beverages.
I have so much confidence in this
remedy that I propose distributing trial
bottles free from the leading newspapÂ«r
offices throughout the country. I want
everybody to try It. feeling confident
that it will bring relief and happiness.
Trusting you will aid me In this in-
vestigation. I bÂ«g to remain.
Tours faithfully.
J. M. HUSTON.
Professor Munyon haÂ» adopted the
t-ame method of Introducing this remedy
that has characterized the introduction
of all bis other remedies â by distribut-
ing free samples from the leading news-
paper offices, and inviting the public to
make a thorough test and then report the
results through the columns of tne
newspapers.
We cheerfully open the columns of our
paper to this investigation, and hope
that every person " suffering wiÂ£h any
nerve cr stomach trouble will give this
remedy a careful test.
This free distribution will begin Sat-

THE persistent teachings of Booker Washington, his
remarkable capacity for statement and the practi
cal results of his philosophy among the negroes
are beginning to influence members of his race who are
are not under his immediate care at Tuskegee. In
Georgia there is the Schoficld Normal and Industrial
School for negroes. From its name we conclude that it
is a private endowment, and not a public or State insti
tution. This school issues a periodical bulletin, by which
one may keep in touch with its work and purposes. The
last issue gives notice of a coming farmers' conference of
the negro farmers of the region, and publishes a platform
in the form of a pledge and working plan for the mem
bers of that race, as a means of material and moral
progress. :h*
Those who have heard Booker Washington will appre
ciate in this pledge the hold that his views have taken
upon his people. It declares: "Realizing that our man
ner of living acounts for our present condition, we
pledge ourselves from this time forth:
; "1. To do away with the mortgaging of our crops or
stock, living on credit system, buying unnecessary arti
cles of wear, and the expenditure of money for intoxica
ting liquors, etc.
"2. To raise our food supplies at home, such as corn,
potatoes, peas, hogs, syrup, 'chickens, etc., and to put
more dignity and labor into the soil, whether owners,
renters, share-croppers, or wage hands.
"3. To extend the two and three months'- school term
to five or six months, thus affording our children better
opportunities to prepare themselves for a living. ' We
shall use every effort to unite the several schools in our
district to a central point, secure the services- of God-

Here Is a yarn that Melvin Chap

McKenna, the latter now one of the
Justices of the United States Su
preme. Court.
Tyler once went to Fairfield, Cal., to
argue a demurrer to a complaint. Mc-
Kenna was attorney for the plaintiff.
After Tyler had talked to the court
for two weary hours McKenna, in that
gentle manner for which he has al
ways been famous, suggested that he
thought "Counsel had failed utterly to
discuss the essential features of the
matter." Tyler retorted in his gruff
est tones: "Mr. McKenna, what you
don't know about law â and what I
don't "know â would fill a very large
volume." Suavely but instantly the
little gentleman restorted: "Yes, Judge
Tyler, and that is the work from
which you have been quoting all

A well-known newspaper man is
imbued ' with the belief that he can
make a fortune in hen culture. He
has a ranch in the country within easy
access of the city, where his family
resides. His son, a boy about 5 years
of age, whose bump of inquisitiveness
is very fully developed for one so
young, sought to learn something
about hen culture from his grand
father recently while at the ranch.
While the old gentleman was en
joying a smoke on the porch the lit
tle'fellow climbed on his knee and
began: "Say, grandpa, do hens make
their eggs?"
"Why, certainly," replied the old
gentleman.
"Just the same as a boy. makes a
ball when his papa won't buy him
one?"
"Oh, no; not exactly that way."
"Do they put the yellow in first and
then cover it with white?"
"Don't bother me with such ques
tions," testily replied the old gentle
man. "You will know all about it
when you grow up." He rose from
his seat and walked away, but the in
quisitive youngster ran after him and
put the finishing touches on by ask
ing: "Say, who sews the covers on
'em?" Then he fled to a place of
safety.
IT seems that the prompt action of the United States
in making a treaty with China by which the ports of
Mukden and Antung in Manchuria are to be opened
to our commerce has stirred the wrath of Russia. Press
reports credit Admiral Alexieff with the statement that
Russia looks upon this action of the United States as an
unfriendly move, and he admits that it upsets all of his
calculations. He further goes on to state, through his
secretary, that the United States committed a grave in
discretion in not first asking the permission of the Rus
sian Government to make the commercial treaty with
China. The cause for Russia's interest in the matter he
naively puts thus: "Orders were given six months ago,"
says the admiral through his mouthpiece, "to evacuate
Newchwang and Manchuria, provided the Chinese would
agree to simple terms; but owing to the intrigues of the
Japanese Minister with the Wai Wu Pu (Chinese Foreign
Board), these orders were countermanded." ,
It looks very much as if the keen diplomacy of Secre
tary Hay had at .last forced Russia to show her hand.
After these many months of devious diplomatic squirm
ings, postponements, statements and counter-statements
meaning nothing and leading nowhere, the Government
of the Czar announces that it looks upon insistence by
this country upon open ports in Manchuria with grave
concern. This in fine is the statement on the part of
Russia that China has lost all right to any jurisdiction in
Manchuria. The action of this Government has led Rus
sia to make the tardy statement that the policy of "hands
off" now obtains in this part of the empire of China. Rus
sia is at last officially disclosed as the arbiter of affairs in
Manchuria, if not the actual master.
But the test of Russia's assumption is yet to come.
Acting upon the seemingly manifest fact that China still
exercises sovereignty over Manchuria, the administration
at Washington has seen fit to conclude with the Emperor
of China a treaty of commerce which affects the trade
status of two of China's ports. China certainly entered into
the treaty under the conception that she had the right to
make agreements affecting these two ports. Wherein
then lies the assumption, on the part of Russia of the
authority to consider this agreement between two sov
ereign powers in the light of an unfriendly act? No
treaty for the cession of Manchuria to Russia has been
signed by China; neither has Russia announced that Man
churia is hers by right of conquest. It now remains to
be seen whether or not Russia will care to make objec
tion to our acquisition of trade rights. If so the situation
is likely to become quite interesting.
RUSSIA IS DISPLEASED.
Helps for Home Ills.
BY MART TAYLOR-ROSS.
(Household Expert.)
Copyright. 1904. by Joeeph B. Bowles.
Among the several accomplishments,
trades and professions which belong to
the many - sided housekeeper is a
knowledge of what is best to do in
cases of emergency, to save present
suffering, or to prevent a serious out
come in the small ills of life that come
to every household.
First in importance is a preparation
for accidents. They may not happen for
a year â they may come within a day â
one cannot know, and the only safe
way is to be prepared.
Supplies that will prove useful in
such an emergency are rolls of band
ages, of various widths, made from
sections of old sheets, washed very
clean, torn into strips and rolled very,
very tight. A jar of borated gauze,
for doing up small wounds as well as
large, will lessen the chances of con
tamination and blood poisoning. Rolls
of absorbent cotton can be purchased
in a pasteboard carton that opens like
a box of biscuits, and which will last
an ordinary family for some months.
Use a bit of this instead of a powder
puff for baby, and throw it away, using
a fresh piece every time. This can be
bought from 25 cents up, according to
the width of the cotton. A supply of
court plaster comes in a long tin box*
in which it will keep perfectly until
used. Narrow strips of this, used to
draw together the edges to a long, or a
deep cut, after the wound has been
well washed out in warm water would
save many a child from an ugly scar.
Use a bit of the absorbent cotton for
washing out the wound, instead of a
sponge â always of doubtful cleanliness.
The few times that adhesive plaster
would be used in a lifetime hardly
makes it necessary to keep a supply on
hand, for a physician always carries
some about with him. Select the court
rlaster that is on silk, for this is finest
and best for dressing wounds. A bot
tle of carbolic acid for use in the
water with which a wound is washed
completes the supplies for accidents,
unless one includes a bottle of per
oxide of hydrogen, which, however, de
teriorates, and is best bought in very
small quantities.
For burns (external) there are many
good remedies, but one that Is apt to
j be at hand, and is mc-st efficacious, is
alcoholâ pure alcohol. Cider vinegar is
another remedy for burns, and every
one is familiar with soda moistened
with water that is so often used to
alleviate the pain of a burn. A bottle
of sweet oil and lime is kept on hand
in many homes, and a small bottle of
collodion will be found of great ser
j vice in relievlne the sting of the small
: burns that are so irritating to tired
j nerves, whether of a child or a busy
j housewife. Burns that are serious â
I those that affect the true or under skin
as well as the surface cuticle â should
have the attention of a physician, for
home treatment is not adequate, and
what seems like a very, small burn may
prove very troublesome. The writer
has known a burn less than an inch
j in diameter to remain sore for months,
and require frequent dressing to pre
vent blood poisoning.
For neuralgia, cramps and such ills
as seem to call for the application of
heat the hot water bottle may be used
or a pair of hop pillows or sacks of salt,
heated one after the other and applied
to the seat of pain. Better than any
of these and holding its heat better
than even a hot water bottle is a bag
of sand. When one visits, the beach a
sack of sand should be gathered and
taken home, then filled' into the soft
bag of flannel (outing flannel), which
may be placed on a pan and set in the
small hot oven of the kitchen range
to bake. For cold beds at night dur
ing the winter these sand bags will
be found most comfortable. When one
is in a great hurry to apply heat the
Ftove lid from one of the back stove
j holes can be slipped into the leg of
! an old stocking, wrapped a little more
i and applied to t^ie seat of the pain.
This is Quick and effectual. If the
time is summer and artificial heat not
at hand, an ordinary lamp chimney
after the lamp has been lighted for ten
or fifteen minutes will be found as hot
as can be borne, even when wrapped
in an old stocking. This is especially
good for a baby, being light in weight.
Some of our public-spiftted citizens have begun a
campaign to secure a world's fair for San Francisco in
1913. Our splendid experience wjth such an exposition
is absolute guarantee of our ability to conduct a larger
and better one, and the many thousands of Americans
who have been our guests in recent years can give ample
testimony that no city deserves more than ours the dis
tinction of being a world's emporium.
Canal Digging Machinery.
BT MALCOLM McDOWELU
lAuthcr â¢ - Â£hou Talk on the Wonders of the
Craft*.")
_ Copyright. 1904. by Joseph B. Bowles.
Machinery, not men, will dig the isth
mian canal. There will be some skilled
engineers and mechanics, and sev
eral thousand muckers, hoboes and la
borers, but they will simply be the at
tendants upon the huge excavating and
handling mechanisms, which will fairly
eat their way through rock, clay,
muck, sand or whatever material
makes ui> the isthmus which connects
the two Americas.
There probably was never a Treater
variety of solid matter tackled- by
canal builders than confronted the con
tractors who built Chicago's great
combination ship and drainage canal.
'ihe engineers bunched the several kinds
of materials into two general classesâ
polid rock and glacial drift. But if
there was any kind of mean, obdurate,
elusive, hard-to-manage, money-losing,
disappointing, obstinate, machinery
breaking, impassable material which
failed to get into the glacial drift be
tween Chicago and the Lockport end of
the canal the contractors couldn't find
it.
But there were a number of wide
awake, pushing contractors on the
work. They were not afraid to
â¢Â¦plunge" on expense if there was any
likelihood that the money spent for
special machinery to handle the hetero
geneous aggregation of solid material
would give them a device which would
handle the material at a profit-making
cost. The result was a number of ex
cavating and material handling equip
ments of such novel construction that
engineers came from all parts of the
Â¦world to study the modern methods of
excavation developed by the contrac
tors on the Chicago drainage canal.
Those methods and devices will cut
the channel which will make islands of
the American continents, for the;a is
r.o material in Panama or Nicaragua,
solid or fluid, between the 'two oceans
which cannot be handled for the mini
mum of coEt with the maximum of at
tainment by the steam shovels, dry
excavator?, conveyors, huge plows, air
drills, channeiers. cable ways, canti
lever conveyors, high power and re
volving derricks, inclined ways, gran
ulators, pneumatic dumps, hydraulic
dredges and other forms of rock-cut
ting, earth -digging, sand-sucking ma
chinery which cut through the divide
that kept Lake Michigan from running
dry into the Mississippi Valley.
American engineers who viewed the
Panama cut when the French com
pany was "excavating it commented on
the inadequ-'tte machinery employed.
One of them remarked: "Thev sim
ply 6kinned the face of the work."
What he meant was that the machin
ery did not handle large masses in a
large -way.
In the last ten years American in
genuity brought into play on the Chi
cago drainage canal has so developed
the excavating machinery which was
modern in even' sense of the word a 1
decade ago that it is probable the
Panama or Nicaragua canal will be
built well within the present esti
mates of cost.
The first machines used on the Chi
cago canaf were the plows, slushera
and "wheel scrapers which railroad
contractors use on earth work. Then
came a grader, which was a com
bination of an immense breaking plow
attached to a wheeled running gear.
A revolving apron, driven by the run
ning gear, carried the plowed up earth
upward and dumped it into a wagon,
which followed the machine. When
this wagon was full an empty wagon
was driven under the apron and filled.
Sixteen horses hauled this grader,
and some of the machines excavated
and lifted 100 cubic yards of earth
an hour.
Then came the steam shovels â huge
dippers that bit out two and one-half
cubic yards of dirt every time the
ponderous beam crowded the gigan
tic dipper into the earth. There was
nothing particularly novel about these
Fhovels, except their size, and some of
them were the largest and most pow
erful ou the face of the earth. These
shovels dipped up sand, earth, the
preat bowlders which the glacier left
behind, blasted rock, cemented gravel
and bowlder clay. Anything and
everything that happened to be in the
way was jroujred out and lifted into
the dump cars or spilled out on the
*ide of the cut- Some of the steam
shovels weighed seventy-two tons
each. Over fifty of these ponderous
machines were at work at one time
' the channel.
An original device which attracted
much attention was a conveyor, which
worked in connection Â¦with one of the
largest plows ever made. It was made
in the lorm of a bridge, which span
ned the channel and which carried an
endless steel belt 1300 feet long. This
Lett was made up of four- foot panlike
sections, which traveled in a metal
.xottgh that lay across the bottom of
<*?Â« cut. A hoisting engine dragged
Â«ae great double end plow,, buck and
forth. ~nd the plowed up material
fell into the steel pans, which car
ried it across and up thÂ« steep in

A Word From IV. C. T. V.
The following bit of irony comes
from the National American Woman
Suffrage Association:
The women of Denver may explain
and protest as long as they please, but
the more the matter is discussed the
more evident does it become that the
climax .of political corruption ha3 been
discovered in Colorado, and to Miss
Elizabeth McCracken and the Outlook
belongs the credit of discovering it.
Colorado, as we all know, is one of
those God-forsaken States where wo
men are not classed with "idiots, luna
tics, minors and criminals," but have
all the rights of citizens. Naturally we
should expect such a State to furnish
some crowning instance of political
corruption and Colorado has not dis
appointed us.
A certain woman candidate, name
not given, has been found guilty of
winning votes by being kind. She was
a kind woman by nature and when she
became a candidate for office she act
ually kept on being kind and her kind
ness won votes for her.
. The case calls for comment, but
where in the English language can
words be" found that will accurately
describe and fittingly condemn such a
degree of political depravity?
We are familiar with the spectacle of
the man candidate who buy3 votes
with whisky and boodle, so familiar
with it. indeed, that it makes little im
pression on us and nobody seems to
care whether the offender Is punished
or not. But when it comes to a woman
candidate getting votes by being kind
the offense is one that stirs the blood
of the most apathetic citizen and rouses
him to indignant protest.
Two years ago the National Ameri
can Woman Suffrage Association asked
that a Congressional committee be ap
pointed to Investigate the workings of
woman suffrage. Let us have that com
mittee at once and let Colorado be the
first State Investigated. Meanwhile, is
there not in our present Congress
some patriotic man who will immor
talize himself by introducing: "A Bill
to Prevent Women Candidates in Colo
rado from Being Kind? "
LIDA CALVERT OBENCHAIN.
x -r rHEN Mr. Bryan returned from Europe he held
\ A / a reception in New York. That was right.
Â¦ Â» Fresh from the contrast between his own coun
try and those he had visited, he made a speech in which
he lauded the United States as the land of best opportu
nity, greatest freedom, and in all ways the most desir
able. He had been abroad and returned a good Ameri
can, uttering frankly the results of his observations and
comparisons.
The speech was so different from his usual pessimism
that it would make a good Republican- campaign docu
ment. The Goddess of Liberty must have felt like bow
ing her acknowledgments to Mr. Bryan for at last saying
a good word for her. The speech was so marked in its
indorsement of existing conditions that Mr. Bryan's
Eastern friends took it as a sort of formal withdrawal
from politics, since it presented the country as doing so
well that no party can make headway by advocating a
change. But those who lotted on Mr. Bryan long re
maining in the attitude of approval of his country are
disappointed. A few days after his New York speech,
he was invited to a Democratic banquet at New Haven,
where he made a speech that is in startling contrast to
the one in New York.
In New Haven he- found the common people under the
heel of wealth. He viewed with alarm, rang the tocsin,
raised his voice for his oppressed countrymen and against
the oppressors, and issued such a despairing prospectus
as would turn back the. immigrants that are pouring into
New York, if they could read it. He declared that the
century long struggle of our people for liberty has not
yet been crowned with success. He held that struggle
up and looked at it, and striking an attitude of the most
energetic oratory, asked: "Will it win? As the martyrs,
who eighteen hundred years ago, kneeling in prayer
while hungry beasts devoured them, invoked a power
mightier than the legions of Rome, to-day the same, it is
not only possible but necessary to appeal to that moral
sentiment which when aroused will prove more potent
than the purse."
Now, what does all that mean? What happened in a
few days between New York and New Haven to change
this fcom the best country in the world to one in which
we must sit down and look at people at prayer being
eaten raw by wild beasts, and admit that we are like
unto them?
There was not much change in the weather, nor in
stocks nor in prices. What then changed us, in the
twinkling of an eye, from a prosperous and happy -people
into martyrs served a la carte to lions and tigers and
other members of the cat family? On Friday night,
seen from New York, we were the happiest people on
earth, enjoying equality of opportunity, cheerfully pay
ing for the Christmas presents our wives had put in our
stockings; but on the following Monday, without a rag
to our backs, we were asked to think about the legions
of Rome, and compared to those who used the prayer
cure in vain when it came time to feed the menagerie.
Some suspect that in that brief space Mr. Bryan con
cluded to become a Presidential candidate again, and
found it necessary to talk of graves and worms and epi
taphs once more. Be that as it may, it is sure that in 'his
New York speech he uttered the ripe and cheerful con
clusions of a majority of his countrymen. .He also stated
the reason why even the most bciotted people of the
European countries he visited know that this is the land
of man's best opportunity, and that is why there is now
the greatest movement hither that was ever known to
any country in the world. Men expatriate themselves
to better their condition, not to make it worse. These
immigrants do not come here to be metaphorical
martyrs and be figuratively eaten by wild beasts while
the Sheriff looks on. They come to seek the conditions
seen in the New York vision, and not in the subsequent
revelation of New Haven, and they are not deceived.
There are some carping critics, of course, who say that
Mr. Bryan's vision was jaundiced when his foot touched
the soil of Connecticut, by the reflection that he is not
to touch that $30,000 of Mr. Bennett's money. Tough
mutton, half chewed by Bonaparte, lost the battle of
Leipsic, and that piece of sheep, therefore, was the cause
of the prospective war between Russia and Japan. Drop
ping an adjective out of an order sent the Light Brigade
to slaughter before Balaklava. Light causes produce
heavy effects, and it may be that the decision of a pro
bate judge in Connecticut changed our own our native
land from a scene of peace and plenty into one of de
spair and disaster.

with a shake or nod of the head, an
elevation of the hand, can convey val
uable pointers to the man on the bridge
of a docking liner. He has one fault.
Upon occasions of great provocation he
swears.
In justice, however, be it recorded
that the provocation must be great and
the swearing is In a class all by itself.
A student of the\ Scriptures and a class
ical scholar, he decorates his profanity
with biblical allusions and apt extracts
from ancient writers, skillfully min
gling word pictures from the old world
and similes from the sea with the com
mon or water front argot of ordinary
vexed mortals.
His usefulness to his employers cloaks
even this fault, if its very picturesque
ness is not its own apology. A few days
ago, however, one of the high chiefs
in authority over him suggested the
advisability of moderation In this re
gard.
"If you must swear, captain," said
he, "have it out quietly at the end of
the wharf. Then the friends of pas
sengers will hear nothing to jar their
nerves and the seagulls won't mind."
A few days later the big provocation
came. The wharf was crowded with
ladles and their escorts. The captain
was in the midst of the throng. Some
thing happened. His face blanched.
He wanted to turn loose, but remem
bered the request for moderation. He
gasped and sputtered. An idea came
to his relief. In a voice grown lusty
from long usage he yelled:
"Ladies, please stand back! Back,
quick! Get out of the way!"
Thinking his cuick eye had detected
a parting line or some other threat
ening danger, customs officers joined
with police in moving back the crowd.
When there was a margin of some
twenty feet of unoccupied wharf be
tween him and the people he turned
to the man on the liner who had blun
dered:
"Now, you blanked idiot!" screamed
the captain, "why in â¢"
them over the corkscrew narrow
gauge track to the top of the "spoil"
bank. Each car was provided with
a compressed air cylinder, whose pis
ton was connected with the body of
the car. All the cylinders were con
nected with compressed air pump and
reservoir on the locomotive. When
the loaded train reached its destina
tion the engineer turned a valve and
all the dump cars tipped over side
ways, dumping their contents. An
other turn of the valve and the cars
righted themselves and were empty
and ready for the return trip.
The channeling machine, which will
take a hand in any rock work on
the ishtmian canal, is a modification
of the steam drill. : It consists of a
vertical boiler and engine, mounted
on four wheels which run on a short
piece of track. The engine operates a
great steel chisel and at the same time
actuates the mechanism which moves
the whole affair back and forth on the
track. While the machine is traveling
its beat the big chisel chugs up and
down, cutting a deep, smooth gash in
the rock on a line with the edge of
the channel. While it is at work a
line of steam or air drills drill holes in
the rock across the channel. Dyna
mite cartridges are put into the hole
and exploded and the whole mass of
rock is broken up, but the gash cut by
the channeling machine prevents the
blast from breaking the rock in the
side of the canal, so that the sides cut
are perfectly smooth.
fearing and competent teachers and to provide for the
transportation of children who live too far to walk to a

"4. To assist in establishing character for our race
by staying away from town on Saturday, where we
loiter about the. streets, drink and disgrace ourselves in
other ways.
"5. To use our influence against the excursion, hot
supper and camp meeting, aito to endeavor earnestly to
secure comfortable churches and moral preachers.
"6. To urge upon our people the actual necessity of
our owning the land we till, the homes in which we live,
and to beautify our -yards and to make the home attrac
tive."
That is a good platform for anybbdy. But the en
couraging feature in it is that the people who adopt
and propose to live up to it realize their shortcomings
and their need of reform. Every line of it breathes a
moral purpose and a desire to cease to do evil and learn
to do well. There are many white communities, and in
the North, too, that would be better off if more stayed
away from town Saturdays, and so did not loaf about
saloons or gamble and drink.
Given in every Southern State a few centers where
the negroes see so clearly their needs, and resolve so
strongly to seek them by self-amendment, and the whole
black population will finally be leavened by the same
high purpose, and the race problem will afflict the coun
try no more forever.

" BERKELEY, Jan. 21. â Â¦ President
Wheeler announced to-day that under
the terms of the will of the late
Charles F. Doe of San Francisco the
University of California will receive
not less than 1600,000 for the erection
of a new library building. With the
$600,000 the Board of Regents may
erect a building worthy of the univer
sity and the State and ample enough
to meet the needs of faculty and stu
dents for twenty years to come. The
will does not demand that the entire
legacy must be spent on the building
and provision is made that any portion
not needed for it may be used for the
purchase of books. As a handsome
and commodious building can be
erected with a sum much less, than
J 600,000 there is likely to remain at
least $100,000 or $200,000 for the pur
chase of books. In announcing the
terms of the gift President Wheeler
said: "Every friend of the university
will rejoice to hear that a wise bene
factor has now made provision for the
long desired and sorely needed library
building. Every one acquainted with
the .internal workings and needs of
the university knows that no lack is
so bitterly felt as that of a proper
building. No gift could have been so
much appreciated by as many people.
Henceforth the name of Charle3 F.
Doe Is forever enrolled among the
greatest benefactors of the State."
Gift Is for Library.

GIFTED PIANISTE, WHO
WILL GIVE j*. RECITAL.
Sarah E. Atherton, owner of a half
interest in the Hotel Atherton at 1637
Octavia street, who is the defendant in
a suit for divorce brought by Joseph
N. Atherton, filed an answer to his
suit yesterday and also a cross-com
plaint. She denies that she has ever
spent too much time in the company
of E. E. Quayle. one of the ownc -. of
the other half interest in the Hotel
Atherton, as in charged by her hus
band, and in support of her own prayer
for divorce alleges that Atherton has
for the last three years been an
abusive husband. Mrs. Atherton's at
torney is Charles K. Moser.
Mary Jane Floyd secured a divorce
from Edwin P. Floyd yesterday in
Judge Murasky's court on the charge
of desertion. The suit was commenced
by her husband on the ground of
cruc'.ty. but he failed to prove his
case. Judge Kerrigan granted Rosa"
Nelson a divorce from John Nelson for
cruelty, and Judge Sl-ss granted Ed
warJ Riley a divorce from Sara B.
Riley because of her mean treatment
of h'.m.
Suits for divorce were Lied by Alex
ander R. Anderson against Fanny An
derson for â¢intemperance, and Forest
Boulger against J. A. Boulger for de
sertion.
After living happily together for
fc rty-five years James H. and Ellen
Riley, both of whom are near to the
age limit of three score and ten years,
have quarreled and have taken their
t.-ouble into the divorce court. The
suit for divorce brought by James H.
Riley against Ellen Riley a few weeks
ago was heard by Judge Seawell yes
terday and placed on the reserve calen
dar to enable them, before a final de
cision is given, to agree on the amount
of alimony. It Is also hoped, by with
holding the decision, that the aged
couple will settle their difficulties and
agree t-> end their lives together as
happily as they began in 1855.
Riley is an employe of the quarter
master's department at the Presidio./
It appears that four years ago the
husband took exception to.the fact that
his wife allowed his sons, all of whom
are grown, to spend a great deal of
tl-eir time about the house. He insist
ed that they should go to work and
suggested that a smaller house be
taken to prevent them from making
their home with them. But Mrs. Riley
could not send her sons away and
Riley packed up his belongings and
left. He wrote to Mrs. Riley several
times and sought a reconciliation, but
she would not listen to him, and he
brought the action for divorce.
Christina Anthony, the South African
heiress who recently secured the setting
aside of a decree of divorce obtained
from her by Dr. Richard Anthony, the
missionary,' whose life she saved and
who was educated at her expense, on
the ground that it had been fraudu
lently obtained, is again in the divorce
court, but this time as the plaintiff.
Yesterday she filed a suit for divorce
against Anthony, charging him with
desertion.
Charitable institutions of the city
are also given their respective sharc-a
under a percentage calculation, which,
if the estate proves to be worth only
$2,000,000, will make their separate al
lowance as follows: Protestant Or
phan Asylum, $12,000; Hebrew Orphan
Asylum. $8000; Catholic Orphan Asy
lum, $S000; Children's Hospital, $12,000;
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society, $3000;
Golden Gate Kindergarten Association,
$12,000.
To the California State University is
bequeathed 24 per cent of the estate,
or a sum ranging between $450,000 and
$500,000, according to the value at which
the estate may be appraised. This sum,
the will provides, shall be used for the
construction of a new library building,
and in the event of there being a sur
plus the latter shall be invested as an
income for the purchase of books. The
bequest to the university is the largest
ever made to the academic department.
The. greater part of the deceased's
local property, which includes some
very valuable holdings, among them
the St. Nicholas Hotel at the junction
of Market. Hayes and L&rkin streets,
a 97-foot frontage on Market street
above Taylor and a piece of property
running from 44 to 58 Market street, is
left in trust to his brpther. Bartlett
Doe, who is to manage it during his
lifetime for the benefit of the legatees,
who are to receive the income, and at
Bartlett Doe's death the property itself
is to revert to the legatees.
The will of the late Charles F. Doe,
bequeathing thousands of dollars to
local charitable institutions, to many
relatives legacies, each of which is in
itself a fortune, and bestowing upon
the California State- University nearly
half a million dollars for a new library,
was filed for probate yesterday.
The instrument bears the date of
August 21, 1902. and provides for the
distribution of an estate valued at be
tween $2,000,000 and J3.000.000, with the
probability of reaching nearer the lat
ter figure. It names the Union Trust
Company as executor and devises the
bulk of the estate to twenty-two of the
deceased millionaire's nephews and
nieces, who, with the exception of his
brother, Bartlett Doe, are his nearest
relatives, for Charles F. Doe was a
bachelor. Each of these beneficiaries is
given a certain percentage of the es
tate, their individual shares ranging
from $40,000 to $100,000, according, to
their ages and other conditions. '

A distressing case of Fibroid Tumor,
which baffled the skill of Boston doctors.
-Mrs. Hayes, of Boston, Mass., in
the following letter tells how she was
cured, after everything else failed, by
Lydia JL Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
Mrs. Hayes* First Letter Appealing to Mrs. Plnkham for Help s
" Deak Mbs. Pixkham : âI ha-ro been under Boston doctors' treat-
ment for a long time without any reliet They tell me I have a fibroid
tumor. I cannot sit down without great ~pain, and the soreness extends
np my spine. I have bearing-down pains both back and front. My ab-
domen is swollen, and I have had flowing spells for three years. i(y ap-
petite is not good. I cannot walk or be on my feet for any length of time.
"The symptoms of Fibroid Tumor given in your little book ac-
curately describe my case, so I write to you for advice."â (Signed) Mrs.
E. F. Hayes, 252 Dudley St, (Roxbury) Boston, Mas3.
Note the result of Mrs. Pinkham's adviceâ al-
though she advised Mrs. Hayes, of Boston, to take
her medicineâ which she knew would help herâ
her letter contained a mass of additional instruc-
tions as to treatment, all of which helped to bring
about the happy result.
"Dear Mrs. Pdtkham: â Sometime ajro I wrote to you describ-
ing my symptoms and asked your advice. You replied, and I followed
all your directions carefully, and to-day I am a well woman.
w The use of L.ydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound entirely
expelled the tumor and strengthened my whole system. I can walk
miles now.
" Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is worth five dol-
lars a drop. I advise all women who are afflicted with tumors or
female trouble of any kind to give it a faithful trial." â (Signed) Mas.
E. F. Hayes, 252 Dudley St, (Roxbnry) Boston, Mass.
Mountains of gold could not purchase such testimony â or take
the place of the health and happiness vhich Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound brought to Mrs. Hayes.
Such testimony should be accepted by all women as convincing
evidence that Lydia E. Ptnkham's Vegetable Compound stands
without a peer as a remedy for all the distressing ills of women; all
ovarian troubles; tumors; inflammations; ulceration, falling and dis-
placements of the womb; backache; irregular, suppressed or painful
menstruation. Surely the volume and character of the testimonial let-
ters we are daily printing in the newspapers can leave no room for doubt
Mrs. Hayes at her above address will gladly answer any letters
which sick women may write for fuller information about her illness.
Her gratitude to Mrs. Pinkham and Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound is so genuine and heartfelt that she thinks no trouble is too
great for her to take in return for her health and happiness.
Truly is it said that it is I<y d la E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound that is curing- so many women, and no other medicine ; don't for-
get this when some druggist wants to sell you something else.

The committee did not vote on the
proposed changes to be made in the
laws governing athletes. It was de
cided to bring the matter up at the
next meeting, which will be held in
Oakland in two weeks. Should the
proposed new laws go into effect they
will revolutionize the present system
now in vogue in the league.
An application for membership
from Boone's Academy, Berkeley, was
laid on the table, to be voted on at
the next meeting. One of the mem
bers objected to the admission of the
school on the ground that in his opin
ion that institution had recently ac
quired many good athletes and they
might possibly take away .some rec
ords now held by other schools of the
league.
The members of the Academic Ath
letic League held their regular ses
sion last night in the directors' room
in the Olympic Club. Representatives
from all the schools in the league were
present. After a brief discussion the
committee in charge decided to admit
the Vallejo and Pacific Grove High
schools to membership. â¢
Two Schools Admitted to Membership
and Application of Another Is
Laid on the Table.

Audience at tlio First Unitar
ian Church.
Professor Freyer, instructor in
*>riental languages and literature at
the Cnlvenlty of California, gave the
Â«?cond of a course of lectures by uni
versity professors at the First 'Uni
tarian Church. Geary and Franklin
EtreetH. last evening to a large and ap
preciate audience.
Of all the Oriental? the Chinese, said
The professor, seem further removed
from us in their characteristics than
any other race and yet we are destined
sooner or later to come into much
closer contact with them.
The lecturer referred 10 China as
the oldest survivor among the nations
f>{ .antiquity because she possesses the
secret of national antiquity. What
**he cannot conquer by diplomacy or
war sh*Â» succeeds in absorbing or
transforming.
Professor Freyor talked of the many
Western ideas aa well as art5, sciences
and manufactures that young China
has? adopted in spite of the opposition
of thÂ» anti-foreign or conservative
parties in the Government, Railways,
telegraphs, steam navigation, post
offices, manufactories, mining, colleges
and universities for Western learning
vere briefly alluded to. Reference
Â¦was madÂ» to the fact that dozens of
young Chinese were trying to get
through the University of California
at their own expense and in many in
stances on slender means.
The lecturer concluded with a sketch
of China's position In the Japan-
Jlussia affair. He saw that war must
come, because Russ'a will not cease
her aggressions and that Japan must
resist or be swallowed up by the Czar.

Brandt conditionally a3 an apprcn:ice. and as

fight with the New Orleans boxer.

no permit has been secured for the

tail as there seems no qm*5,lion that the
San Francisco Athletic Club will secure
the permit.
Manager Alex Greggains of the San

yesterday from Parson Davies, the
manager of Kid Broad, that the latter
had left New Orleans for this city. He
is due here on Monday morning. His
manager wires that he will weigh about
133 pounds.
Eddie Hanlon took up his former
quarters yesterday at Croll's Gardens,
Alameda. He will be trained, as in the
past, by Harry Foley, and he will have
the services of Fred Landers as spar
ring partner. Hanlon will not give up
much time to boxing. He will do con
siderable road work, fo that his legs
will not tire if the fisht goes a long
way. He will weigh fully as much as
Broad when hÂ» enters the ring.

The management of Ingleside Cours
ing Park has decided to promote the
sport but one day a week until the end
of the racing season. It has always
been" customary to run on Saturday
and Sunday, but with strong counter
attractions the Saturday attendance
has been gradually growing small. As
the services of a large number of men
are required it was found unprofitable
to promote the sport on that day.
A sixty-four-dog stake will be run
on Sunday, the first brace of grey
hounds going to the slips at 10 o'clock.
One effect of the change in running
will be the retiring of the poorer dogs.
This Is noticeable already, the class
being much higher this week than for
merly. The coursing will be of more
even character and better sport is ex
pected to result. The draw last night
resulted as follows:
Radford is 22 years of age, and re
sides in this city. The Radfords re
cently acquired from the Government,
by purchase, the Sespe Hot Springs.
Last Sunday. Iladford. accompanied by
Barney Mowery, left for the springs
to remain several months. According
to a telephone message trom Mowery.
at Fillmore. to the Craigs. Radford had
left the camp last Monday morning, and
has not been seen since. He went out
with a shotgun for the purpose of,
hunting quail.
The resÂ»on in which Radford Is lost
is in the highest mountain region of
the county, and is fifty* miles by th*
shortest trail from here. It is believed
that Radford met with some accident
on the ridge. If he became disabled,
so that he could not travel, it is more
than possible that he will be found
frozen to death.
VENTURA, Jan. 21.â Harry Radford
is lost in the mountains up in the
Sespe Hot Springs region. It Is feared
that he has met with a serious acci
dent or foul play. Lions, bears and
other wild animals abound in this ter
ritory. Snow Is on the ridges. Ben and
Robert Craig headed a searching party
and left Fillmore this morning for the
mountains.

SUMMARY
Taxman at i to 1 took the first race
from nio Chico a 15 to 1 shot, Jingler
b^ingr third. Glenrice, the 1 to 2 favor
ite, could finish no better than fourth.
The two-year-old race at three fur
long? saw the defeat of another favor
ite, when Brown Study beat Melar in
an excMing finish. Hilona was third.
The fourth race, over the Slauson
course, was won by Andrattus at 3 to
1, Athel Ros'e second. Sceptre third.
Elwood repeated his victory of two
days ago in the fifth race, by beating
Dargrin, the odds-on favorite, in clever
style, Atlantico, an outsider, getting
the show. The only winning favorite
of the day was Stemwinder in the last
race, which beat Best Man and Tower
of Candles in the order named. Weath
er clear, track fast.
I-OS ANGELES, Jan. 21.â The talent
had another bad day at Ascot to-day,
but one favorite out of six coming
home in front. There was a good
crowd in attendance and the book
makers again carried home a comfort
able sum. The feature of the day was
a hurdle handicap at a mile and a
quarter over five hurdles. Three of
thrÂ» contestants came to grief. Lurdan
and Ceylon fell at the first jump, and
Heir Apparent lost his jockey at the
last Jump. Cambaceres at 7 to 1 won
easily from Poorlands, the even-money
favorite, which carried a bunch of
weight. Indian II was a poor third.
Only four started in the Futurity
course purse event and the wise divis
ion made the books rub the even money
laid about Princess Titania at post
time. Cascine, which opened equal fav
orite with Johnny Millln's mare, reced
ed to 3 and 3%. . With any sort of fair
ha-ndlingr the Burns & Waterhouse colt
could have won, but the best that can
be said of Bell's work is that it was a
woeful spectacle. He let his mount
drop out of it at the start, then on the
far turn made up a dozen lengths going
a sixteenth of a mile. Turning into the
stretch he passed the Princess and a
furlong from home was still in front.
Then he apparently fell asleep or went
to pieces and the favorite won by more
than a length, Letola downed Reeves
ei-ht lengths for the third position.
Ethel Abbott, ridden by Hildebrand
and favorite for the concluding seven
furlong number, went out in front at
the start and was never headed. Jack
Martin brought Mountebank up, beat
ing out Bill Massie for the place.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Hildebrand rode two winners, was
twice second and on two occasions
finished third, a creditable showing.
i Bullman, who is under suspension
owing to his refractory behavior and
failure to fulfill engagements at the
track, will be permitted to accept a
mount in the stake race to-morrow.
Scherzo, winner of the third race,
was bid. up from $400 to $800 by
Frank Doss. The stable retained the
colt.

CASCINE BADL.Y HIDDEN.
Earney Schreiber's Gene Handlan
went to the post'an 11 to 5 choice for
the next, a five and a half furlong
scramble. Burns rode the colt hard in
an effort to get to the front, but could
not land inside the money. Targette,
the mount of Hildebrand, made all the
running, only to be downed easily at
the finish by Scherzo, a 6 to 1 chance,
piloted by Johnny Daly. Quaker Girl,
a cont< dor throughout, ran. a close
third.
Arisbe, a smart-looking filly by Brn
tus-Annie Buckingham owned by Napa
stock farm, took the three and a half
furlong scramble for two-year-olds. A
3 to 2 favorite with Jack Martin up, she
gradually wore down the lead of Willa
and at the wire finished a length before
DpI Carina, at 15 to 1 shot. Sea Air
ran an ordinary third.
Jockey Otto Wonderiy furnished an
acrobatic entertainment at Oakland
track yesterday not down on the card.
He \iad the mount on Oarsman, the
1 to 2 favorite for the mile and fifty
yard run, ?nd with only 106 pounds to
shoulder the Eastern horse looked like
a certainty. That the bookmakers
have an unseen percentage always
running for them was once more Illus
trated.
Just after the start Wonderiy ran his
mour.t into a "V" formed by the riders
of the inside and outside horses mak
ing play for the pick of the going In
the center of the track, and was
whisked from his seat like a flash,
sfriking on the hard, hard ground.
Otto escaped the flying hoofs, picked
himself uiÂ» and strolled down to the
paddock, escaping without a scratch.
Joe Yeagrer's Waswift, an 8 to 1 shot,
then went on and won all the way,
reachiq? the wire more than a length
ahead of Grafter, a 16 to 1 shot. The
three-year-old Hugh McGowan was
third.
FOLEY'S POOH HORSEMANSHIP.
The track, while good, was still a
trifle Flow. Favorites held their own by

With an intelligent ride Emily Oliver
might have won the opening event.
The mare received such consistent
backing that she closed a mild favorite
over Harbor and Hungarian. Foley
dealt out the beEt he could, but that
isn't much, and Emily finished third.
lTHdebrand made all the running with
Harbor, only to be collared and easily
beaten at the finish by Libbie Candid,
a 15 to 1 shot. Tommy Butler rode the
winner.

W. A. Agard lost a suit against
Auditor Shaffer of San Diego County
in the Supreme Court yesterday. The
plaintiff prepared abstracts of mort

Assessor. His recompense was fixed
by the Recorder and the Board of
Supervisors at $1304. The Auditor
refused to agree to the transaction
and suit against him was commenced.
Section 3678 of the Political Code,
which "gives to boards of supervisors
the power of fixing the compensation
of county officials, is cited by Agard
in support of his contention. Article
11, section 5 of the^ constitution is
cited by Auditor Shaffer in reply. It
is found that the two ) laws conflict
and the court therefore declares the
first mentioned invalid., â¢Â£

William Gerber, whose 70 years give
him the appearance of a man leaning
over the outer edge of eternity, was
sentenced by Judge Cabaniss yesterday
to flve months in the County Jail for
passing fictitious checks. The com
plaining witness was Mrs. Kate Jun
gers. who has a resort for the extin
guishment of thirst for those who do
their training in Golden Gate Park.
Altogether Gerber imposed on the wom
an for $90 by fictitious drafts. -He has
been previously convicted of similar of
fenses within the last two years.
Francisco Rossi and Gionani Fossa
were on preliminary trial for the mur
der of Vincenso Lavaginlno before
Judge Conlan yesterday. They are ac
cused of beating Lavagnino into a
pitiable condition and leaving him
leaning against a fence on Lombard
street and Van Ness avenue. From the
effects of the injuries Lavaginino took
an voyage into eternity and a charge
of murder was lodged against his al
leged assailants.
A peculiar witness was on the stand
yesterday, who laid claim to the name
of Olympio Dezini. The witness testi
fied that on the night of the alleged
crime he had left his bed for a stroll
and met a woman on Van Ness avenue
who asked for a cigarette. With" the
chivalry of an Italian gentleman he ac
commodated the "loidy." His reminis
cences were vague and weak, although
he remembered everything connected
with the murder. Judge Conlan was
somewhat anxious on the memory
proposition, and he took the witness in
hand himself.
He asked if there still lingered in the
brain of the witness any remembrance
of what she looked like, whether she
was tall or short, what color of gown

Judge Conlan yesterday for selling
liquor without a license. Morrissey con
ducts a joint on Mission street, and he
told the Judge that his eyes were bad,
so that when he gave a policeman a
drink of whisky he thought it was
cider. He was really surprised that
there was any whisky on the prem
ises. Judge Conlan's temperature went
up 9 degrees during the narration, and
the policeman, new to his trade, nearly
made a rough house in the court.' He
arose in his wrath and declared that
he knew whisky when he tasted it,
which was probably true.

MS. BOWERS' CONVICTION*
GIVES SATISFACTION
chjxksf: pleads guilty
to charge of robbery
An investigation of Hayes' criminal
record is somewhat interesting. He
began his career in 1867, when he was
arrested for burglary in this city and
sent to Folsom for one year. In 1869
he was convicted of robbery and sen
tenced to San Quentin for five years.
As soon as he emerged he stole a grip
arid went to the County Jail for thirty
days. In September, 1874, he spent 100
days in the County Jail for battery.
The following year he went to Folsom
on a charge of burglary for two years
and three months. On his release he
committed the crime of grand larceny
in Colusa County and went to San
Quentin for three years. When he was
released he invaded the peaceful pre
cincts of San Francisco and committed
the crime of battery, for which he
served six months in the County Jail.
In the last week of December, 1S81,
he was convicted of petty larceny, with
a prior conviction, and sent to San
Quentin for two and a half years.
After his release the Sacramento au
thorities got hold of him and sent him
to Fo-lsom oa a â¢ burglary charge for
two years. When he was released _ in
1887 he went to San Jose and commit
ted grand larceny,, for which he re
ceived a sentence of five years in Fol
som. He was discharged in Septem
ber, 1900.
Now he is sitting at the feet of the
Goddess of Justice, whom he spurned
in the golden days of his youth, and
seeking to claim what he never lost, to
the detriment of an honest man.
It took about one-tenth of a second
for, Judge Fritz to make up his mind
in regard to the complaint of forgery
against Coleman Conroy, a saloon
keeper at 215 Third street. The defend
ant was dismissed without a showing.
The complaining -witness was a man
who gave his name as Hugh Hayes.
His real name is Patrick Hayes. He
was suspiciously careful in all the evi
dence he gave and told a remarkable
story of how a hardworking man had
been bunkoed by a merciless saloon
keeper. His story was entirely too
specious for scrutiny and his appear
ance was against him. He refused to
answer a question as to whether he had
ever been convicted of a felony until
ordered to do so by the Judge. Then
he coyly admitted to one term.
A railroad ticket is not a contract,
according to a decision rendered by the
Supreme Court yesterday. It is also
declared thot transportation companies
may make rules and regulations be
yond what appears on the face of a
ticket and that the passengers must
comply with them all. Two Justices
strcngly dissent from the opinion of a
majority of the court.
Wcrthington Ames purchased from a
Southern Pacific agent at the ferry
station a ticket to I>>s Angeles on the
Owl train in November, 183?. He was
informed that he must engage a berth
in one of the sleepers. It happened
that no berth could be secured and
Anes took a seat In the tlay coach. He
â¢was put off at Port Costa, with instruc
tions to board the next train. He came
; .: â¢Â¦Â¦: to San Francisco instead and
commenced a suit for damages.
The jury in th<? Superior Court re
turned a verdict in favor of the cor
poration and Ames appealed.
His argument is that a railroad tick
et is a contract pure and simple. In
the case at bar nothing w^s said on the
ticket about the necessity of procuring
a bprrh. A first-class passage on
"train No. 'Owl' " was guaranteed. The
Supreme Court says that a ticket- is
more of a receipt than a contract. It
is held that the company may impose
Fuch additional conditions as it may
pep fit and that the passenger is bound
to observe them. Justice Van Dyke Is
the author of the opinion and with
htm Justices McFarland. Lorisan and
Hensbaw directly concur.
Justice Shaw writes a scathing dis-
FT.ting opinion. He asserts that the
judgment of his colleagues is incon
sistent and cites numerous authorities
to support his contention. At one point
In his argument he says: "I think it
has never before been decided that the
rules and regulations of a railroad
company are of greater potency than
the law of the land, and when incon
sistent with and contrary to a written
contract into which the company has
Â« r.tered are paramount thereto and
famish the legal measure of the rights
<<f parties instead of the contract it
self."
Justice Shaw maintains that a rail
road ticket is a contract and not a re
ceipt. Chief Justice Beatty concurs
with Justice Shaw.
He added that the case was without
doubt the most remarkable one ever
brought before a' Judge in the Superior
Court of San Francisco, inasmuch as
the defendants are seeking to press
charges and that no evidence has been
brought forth to show that the law has
been violated In any particular in
stance.
McEnerney stated that the wharves
on which the commission men sold per
ishable property were the property of
the people and merely held In trust for
them by the Board of Harbor Com
missioners, and that therefore the Har
bor Commissioners had no right to
take such abrupt action or to act with
out giving due notice to the firm.
Webb. was followed by McEnerney,
whose argument took up the remainder
of the session. He sought to show
that the Board of Ha'rbcr Commis
sioners had acted illegally, beyond a
doubt, in revoking the permit of Wet
more Bros., and based his claims on
the fact that no specific charges had
been filed against the firm.
MaEnerney even, insinuated that the
members of the firm were ignorant of
the charges made against them, and
that when they were Drought before
the board at the hearing held on De
cember 3" last the board introduced no
evidence that would warrant the revo
cation of the firm's permit.
WHARVES PUBLIC PROPERTY.
Webb sought to show where the
plaintiff had violated the law in many
instances and said that, although no
specific charges had been made by the
Harbor Commissioners, still the charges
had been set forth clearly in a gen
eral way and there was sufficient evi
dence to show that the firm had vio
lated the law and abused the privilege
which the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners had granted.
SAYS FIRM VIOLATED 1a AW.
The arsuments in the case of Wet
mc-re Bros, against the Board of Har
bor Commissioners for a writ restrain
ing the board from revoking the per
mits of the firm came to a close yes
terday afternoon in Judge Sloss' court.
The Judge took the case under ad
visement and will render a decision
possibly within the, next two weeks.
Attorney Garret McEnerney ccm
sumed a greater part of the day with
the closing argument for the plaintiff.
He commenced his speech as soon as
Attorney General Webb concluded at
11:30 o'clock and held the floor till after
4. McEnerney devoted a deal of his
time to quoting references from va
rious decisions that have been handed
down In similar cases in this and other
States.
When the case was called, the At
torney General arose to conclude his
argument. After summing up the evi
dence introduced by both sides. Webb
stated to the court that in his opinion
the Harbor Commissioners had demon
strated beyond a doubt that they had
acted In the right in revoking the per
mits of Wetmore Bros., and that cm
such a showing there was really no
ground for an injunction.
Between 11 and 12 o'clock that night
Chief Wittman and Captain Martin
stationed themselves in a window of a
restaurant at Eddy and Mason streets
and saw the woman and Alexander
meet on the opposite side of the street.
They saw her pass something to Alex
ander after they had conversed for
about a minute and she left. Captain
Martin brought Alexander before the
Chief and the marked coin was found in
Alexander's pockets. He was at once
suspended.
Although the woman gave her testi
mony at the preliminary hearing be
fore Police Judge Conlan, she positively
refused to testify at the trial before a
jury in Judge Lawlor's court and was
ordered into custody for contumacious
conduct. Speculation is rife as to what
course she will pursue at the second
trial.
A jury was impaneled in Judge Law.

After the jury had been impaneled the
case was continued till this morning.
Alexander's suspension on December
4, 1902, followed by his arrest and the
transfer of several officers on beats in
the "tenderloin district" to other dls r
tricts, caused consternation in the de
partment. .Chief- Wittman had received
information .that Alexander was ex
torting'money from women of the half
world who frequented his beat. on Ma
son street, and one of them, Mamie
Lin, alias Lulu Wilson, on the night
of December 4, 1902, got $2 50 in marked
coin from Chief Wittman to give to
Alexander, as she admitted that she
had been paying tribute to him for
some time, but had refused to pay any
more and he had threatened to keep
her off his beat.

When Captain Martin was asked
about the detention of Mrs! Heath, he
sparred for a time, and then stated that
in his opinion and from what he
learned from his detectives both
women were notorious shoplifters. He
said that the reason for the detention
of Mrs. Herth was that the depart
ment wished to have her photograph.
He finally admitted that if he had been
personally present he would have al
lowed Mrs. Herth's release on the order
issued by Judge Mogan.
Mrs. Herth and her husband, Frank
Herth, strenuously deny that either
one of them has done anything unlaw
ful during life. They have em
ployed counsel and say they will make
a finish fight in a civil suit for the
wrongful detention of the woman.
Judge Mogan, who issued the order of
release, said yesterday: "In my official
capacity I take no cognizance of a
'small book." As -far as I know, every
offense is bailable, except murder. Per
sonal liberty is the greatest right ac
corded to citizens of the United States,
and the proposition of securing surety
to enforce this is the basis of all Eng
lish and American . law, in order that
personal detention jnay not be enforced
from malicious complaints. When I
issued the order for Gertrude Herth's
release on $100* bail I did so on repre
sentations that I fully believed, in my
judicial capacity. Why she was not
released I cannot understand." â¢
During Wednesday evening Mrs.
Herth's husband applied to Judge
Mogan for an order fixing bail in the
case of his wife, and the amount of $100
in the case was exacted. When the
order was presented to the Police De
partment, accompanied by an order of
release, from Judge Mogan, no record
of the woman could be found. She was
buried deeply in the detinue cells. The
acting officials did go to the trouble
of- telephoning to Captain of Detec
tives Martin, who was at the Olympic
Club. They told him about the order
made by Judge Mogan fixing the ball
for Mrs. Herth, and he told them that
if the woman was charged on the pub
lic records with any crime to accept
the order; if she were not, to disregard
it â¢
She was one of two women taken into
custody for the alleged stealing of a fur
from a store at 113 Grant avenue. The
other woman, Hattie Green by name,
was formally charged with the crime
of petty larceny and released on $200
cash bail. But there was no such good
fortune for Mrs. Herth. She was locked
up in what is technically known in
police circles as the "tanks," and the
record of her detention was written on
what is known as "the small book,"
which is such a sacred document that
only the elect of the police force may
gaze upon its sullied pages.
Chief of Police Wittman, Captain of
Detectives Martin and the City ' and
County of San Francisco are threatened
with heavy damage suits as a result of
the detention of a woman named Ger
trude Herth, who was compelled to
spend Wednesday night and nearly all
â¢ he forenoon of yesterday in a cell at
the city prison, contrary to all the pro
visions of the constitution of the Uni
ted States relating to human liberty.
tories that might establish identity. To
all of these the witness returned vague
answers. Finally the Judge became im
patient and blurted out the question,
"Was this woman white or black?"
The witness confessed he was unable
to say what her color was, although he
admitted he had been in her company
for more than fifteen minutes.
Still he could clearly remember that
during his talk with the. woman he saw
Rossi, Fossa and a brother of the latter
carrying the unconscious form of La
vaginino and leaning it up against a
fence at Lombard street and Van Ness
avenue. Judge Conlan did not care to
discuss the case, which Was continued
until Monday, but the impression made
by the first witness for the prosecution
was clearly not favorable. As many as
the courtroom would hold of the Italian
colony of the city crowded into its nar
row precincts during the hearing of
the case and the odor of garlic and red
wine has forever Impregnated the walls
of the courtroom.

I>escendant of King David.
A lineal descendant of Kins David
died in Philadelphia lately. Mrs. Gus
tav Lipschuetz was her name. She
was T>3 years of age. She could trace
her kinship to the distinguished Jew
ish family Abarbanel, whose relation
ship to King David and whose
achievements throughout Europe are
matters of history.
Mrs. Lipschuetz, whose maiden
name was Bertha Neumann, sprang
from that branch of the family of
which Don Isaac Abarbanel, Prime
Minister in Spain in 14 92, was the
head.
During that time, when persecution
against the Jews began as a result of
the change in the religious views of
Ferdinand and Isabella. Don Isaac
was * ' "ipred to flee with his less fa
vored brethren. The family scattered,
settling in various parts of Europe!
Don Isaac afterward tecame Prime
Minister in Italy.
The grandfather of the dead woman
was Rudolph Hirsch Abarbanel, one
of the forer-ost rabbis of Germany
in the last century. â New York Com-

PATENT APPLIED FOR.
The annual meeting of the stock
holders of the Oceanic Steamship
Company was held yesterday. John D.
Spreckels submitted an annual report
showing the company had received,
during the year just closed, $2,033,243 32,
and that the expenses amounted to
$2,262,173 11, the excess of expenses
above receipts being $228,929 88. The
net loss on the operations of the year
was $234,672 01, as against a net loss
for the preceding year of $349,303 72. Mr.
Spreckels also reported as follows:
"In our last annual report reference
was made to the drought in Australia,
which had seriously affected the busi
ness of all steamship lines having ter
minals in that country. We are pleased
to state the country is now rapidly re
covering from this misfortune, but in
the meantime the result has been an
unsettled condition of business during
the past year, incidental thereto. Not
withstanding this fact our service in
the colonies has resulted in a slight
gain for this year in the operation of
the steamers Sierra, Sonoma and Ven
tura.
"The Tahiti branch may be consid
ered very satisfactory, resulting in a
profit for the year of $8309 as against a
loss for 1902 of $19,27r> 38; due in a
measure to increased business, but
more particularly to the decreased cost
of cperation by reason of the install
ation of oil.
"The same may be said of our direct
Honolulu service, which also makes a
vtry satisfactory showing as a result
of the oil-burning equipment of the
steamship Alameda, a saving of $53,
001 14 in fuel and wages having been
effected in the sixteen voyages per
formed during the year.
"We are pleased to report that the
New Zealand Government has renewed
its contract for the conveyance of mails
between New Zealand and San Fran
cisco, this time for a period of three
years from November last, upon same
terms and conditions. Heretofore we
have operated under a yearly contract.
"The company's fleet and property
have been maintained at a high stand
ard of efficiency during the year, and
with the return to normal conditions in
Australia we may justly expect to see
the company placed on a far more fa
vorable footing. We have, therefore,
every reason to feel that the result of
operations for 1904 will offer a much
different and more favorable showing."
The following board of directors was
elected: Claus Spreckels, John .D.
Spreckels, Adolph Spreckels, Frederick
Tillmann Jr., E. F. Preston, H. E.
Bothin and W. D. K. Gibson.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Sonoma, Captain C. F. Herriman.
crowded with passengers and carrying
about 2000 tons of general cargo, sailed
yesterday afternoon for Honolulu and
the Antipodes. The wharf was crowded
with friends of the departing travelers
and to the usual good-by chorus was
added the singing of Salvationists who
assembled on the dock to do honor to
some officers of the army bound for
Honolulu.
The last load of mail reached the
wharf a few minutes late, but strong
men hurried it on board the liner and
the detention beyond the scheduled
sailing time was brief. Among the So
noma's passengers were many promi
nent people, and those going to Hono
lulu included some well known in local
social circles.
The Sonoma's passengers included the
following named:

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The cold weather continued to restrict local
trade in Citrus truits and buyers were - taking
only enough to meet immediate requirements.
. There was absolutely nothing doing in the
- shipping line. Outgoing steamers took out
Â¦ some small shipments of Oranges for Honolulu
and British Columbia, which had been pur
chased at the auction sales and in the open
; market early in the week. It Vs stated that
the large packing houses In the south have
notified growers to cease picking Oranges, as
the fruit is accumulating at shipping points
owing to the scarcity of cars and the over
. stacked condition of the Eastern markets.
Â¦ Only four cars of Oranges are announced Tor to-
I day's auction.
â¢ Trade in Apples was quieter than usual. r.e
' taller^ being apparently well supplied. Prices,
! however, were unchanged, as most dealers were
of the opinion that the lull in the demand was
only temporary. Pears, Bananas and Pine
apples were unchanged.
CHICAGO, Jan. 21.â The day was one of
marked activity and excitement in the wheat
pit. An ominous lull pervaded the pit at the
start. Opening quotations were steady. May
being *4c higher to hie lower at 91%c to 92V t c.
Trading was barely under way, however, when
a general selling movement began in the July
delivery. The cause of the sudden activit> in
this option waÂ» the relief from drought ex
perienced by tl\e growing crop In the South

A mass-meeting under the auspices
of the Postal Progress League was
hejd at the Alhambra Theater last
night, and resolutions advocating a
change in the existing parcels post
regulations adopted. Governor Pardee,
who was expected to preside" at the
meeting, was unable to be present, and
Hugh Craig, former president of the
Chamber of Commerce, acted in his
stead. Mr.. Craig intrpduced Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, president of the Univer
sity of California, who spoke in part
as follows:
"This Is the beginning of a new
movement, and at present the work is
purely educational. The. present arbi
trary rules of the Government regard
ing the rates in parcels are an injury
to the people. I could never under
hand why, when the Government
went into the business of handling
packages, it should say 'thus far shalt
thou go arid no further.' Germany and
England carry packages cheaply and
we carry them at the same rate at this
end, but why should we not carry them
at the same rates for ourselves."
PEOPLE'S INTERESTS.
The speaker said that some persons
had dissented with his views, stating
that it would-be impossible to carry on
such an enterprise without official cor
ruption. In reply he stated that the
United States Government is at pres
ent successfully conducting the Treas
ury at Washington and that the recent
postal scandals may not have- been as
black: as they were painted. In con
clusion the speaker said: "The inter
ests represented here are . pre-emi
nently the people's interests. The fruit
may not be borne in this year or the
next, but it is bound to come."
Edward Berwick, president of the
league, was the next speaker. He ex
hibited a number of charts comparing
the rates of postage on parcels in for
eign countries with those of the United
States. His figures showed that the
rates in all the countries named were
much lower than in the United States
and that also heavier packages were
permissible.
RESOLUTION'S ADOPTED.
Others followed in a similar vein,
and a committee consisting of Messrs.
R. B. Halo and Fred Dohrmann was
appointed on finance, after which the
following resolution was adopted:
'Whereas, In the matter of a domes
tic and foreign parcels post the United
States lags much behind many other
countries; and, whereas, although
various bills have been introduced into
Congress looking to the removal ofthis
reproach and the inauguration of an
up-to-date domestic parcels post ser
vice, no . action has - yet been taken,
be it : , â¢ , Â¦ . ,
"Resolved, By this mass-meeting of
American citizens, convened at the Al
hambra Theater in San Francisco, this
21st day of January, 1904, that we re
spectfully urge our Senators and
Representatives in. Congress, ; now as
sembled,, to take- such steps as shall
insure the speedy establishment of a
domestic parcels post system, as rapid,
efficient and- cheap as any extant in
the. world. Be it further
"Resolved, That this meeting calls on
the President and Postmaster Genera!
to use the power already vested in them"
to enter into parcels post conventions

"Dowie has $25,000,000 of property in
his own name in that place," '.said
Craig, "and on every dollar spent there,
he gets 10 per cent. He, has too good a
thins of it not to return to this coun
try. . I wish I was as ."sure^of getting
half a million as I am f of recovering
from Dowie the money I loaned him in

ment of which he seeks to repudiate. *v
When the Sonoma pulled out into the
stream yesterday and headed for the
Golden Gate, Dowie stood on the
promenade .deck of the vessel and
waved his hat to those assembled, on
the dock. He took the parting cheers
of the crowds to passengers as a fare
well for himself, whereas, as a matter
of fact, five of his deacons were the
only ones to bid him adieu.
Hugh Craig stated yesterday that he
had no fear that he will not recover
his money. He says he is certain of se
curing a judgment against Dowie, and
that it will be collected in Zion City,
Illinois. .
Captain C. F. Herriman of the So
noma says he will maintain discipline
among his passengers on the voyage to
Honolulu; and if there is any trouble
he will take a hand in the matter.
The suit of Hugh Craig, the insurance
man who desires to recover the sum
of $1700 from Dowie for money ad
vanced to him some years ago, did t not
worry "Elijah" or delay his de
parture. >?Co steps were taken to get

the country. .

to the prophet of Zion City. Lively
times are likely to take place on the
Sonoma before the vessel reaches the
Hawaiian Islands. Dowie has no love
for the Salvation Army, and he takes
every opportunity of denouncing Gen
eral Booth and his followers.
The Salvation lads and lasses who
sailed on . the Sonoma declared that
Dowie an.d his deacons were "brands
to be plucked from the burning fire,"
and announced their intention of win
ning the Elijah and his staff from their
path of money-making for selfish gain
and enrolling them In the ranks of
those* .who toil in the gutters to help

That the scalphig business on this

fihoTrn in the recent report made to
Passenger Traffio Manager McCormick
of the Southern Pacific Company by
Chief Train Agent Lund, in which it
is shoTvn that during the year 1903
the iig*Â»nts of the company "lifted"
2000 tickets out of Portland, Ogden,
San Francisco, h'acrr.menio, Los An
geles and El Paso 'tltat were being
wrongfully used. The people whose
tickets were conflscarcd paid into the

pany $57,000 for new transportation
to the end of their journeys.

Progress League Holds Mass-
EDWARD BERWICK. THE
PRESIDENT, OF THE POS
TAL PROGRESS LEAGUE.
Sydney Grundy wrote "The Degen
erates" and Mrs. Langtry and her com
pany appeared in it last evening at the
Columbia before a large audience
tastily attired and quite interested. The
piece was evidently intended to hit off
the moral slipshodness of British up
per-tendom. If the men and women it
depicts were faithfully drawn then
London society needs deodorization.
The men are soulless roues and the
women conscienceless sirens. If the
playwright had treated them strictly
as such his work might not have passed
the censor; but he ingeniously inter
wove with their contempt for marital
loyalty an incongruous sense of mawk
ish honor that relieves to some extent
their moral unworth. The man who
coldly plots to rob his host of both
fortune and wife Is treated as a pretty
good fellow in all other respects. The
woman who proclaims herself incur
ably bad becomes suddenly virtuous
and inconsistently maternal at mention
of the name of the daughter whose ex
istence she has just deplored as a han
dicap in her race for forbidden pleas
ure. That's the woman Mrs. Langtry
portrayed.
But the acting was goodâ and aside
from its theme the play was gÂ«od.
Most of the dialogue was rapid-fire
repartee, with an epigram in almost
every line, and the situations were of
the kind that gradually develop the
clement of suspense until an effective
climax makes one forget the shortcom
ings of the characters and involun
tarily clap one's hands. The third act
is almost as artistically constructed as
that great third act of "Lady^Winde
mere's Fan," which, by the way, it re
sembles in some of the vital scenes.
One woman â a confessed wantonâsac
rificing her self-interest to save the
reputation of a woman whose husband
she had enticedâ is an improbable
thing, but Mrs. Langtry's acting made
it appear so probable and the character
she assumed so forgivable, that she got
half a dozen hearty curtain calls and
would surely have got more if she had
not stopped the clamor by delivering a
npeech. The speech wasn't a scintil
lating gem of impromptu oratory, but
it was delivered with an apparent sin
cerity that more than compensated for
its lack of sounding periods.
"I love San Francisco and its people
and its climate," she said, "and I
wonder how I could have afforded to
stay away from your dear city so long.
But I shall come back within a year."
That is, what one married woman
asks another married woman in "The
Degenerates," and the query might be
adopted as a keynote to the sentiment
of the play.
"But, my dear, why should you
elopeâ it's so entirely unnecessary?"
WARFARE IS EXPECTED.
The appearance of six members of
the Salvation Army on the Sonoma, on
their way to Honolulu, was displeasing
Not one word of, religion or thought
ful" advice "did the self-styled Elijah
put forth. His conversation was given
up entirely to a denunciation of, the
people and newspapers "of San Fran
cisco and a laudation of his own al
leged miraculous powers of healing.
"What do I think of San Francisco?"
replied the twentieth century Elijah,
"why, they are the dirt of the earth.
The people in San Francisco are the
worst I have ever met. The newspaper
men lied about me, worst of all. They
lied about my meetings. I got the best
of - those who opposed me, but the
papers claimed that the people hooted
and hissed at me. Perhaps a few hood
lums'did hiss "and hoot, but I silenced
them b^rny power.
"The meetings were noisy, I admit,
tfut that is no reason to say that I did
not prove my, power. Any one who
says that I came'to- San Francisco to
try to . make money is a liar. j You
newspaper men are the emissaries of
hell. Some day I will try to save you.
"Any one who says I came to San
Francisco to work the people is a liar.
Yes, ' I repeat; ' he* is a liar. If I. had
come to San Francisco with the inten
tion of working the people, I would
have come as a prizefighter and not
as a preacher. Prizefighting is more in
the line of the people of San Francisco
than preaching."
The fat little "overseer of Zion City,"
who spends hundreds of dollars a day
in luxurious comfort, continued in a
strain of invective until the whistle
was sounded for all visitors to leave
the Sonoma.
which he will occupy for the next
twenty-eight days, while crossing to
the Antipodes.
GIVES VENT TO ABUSE.
Dowie's opinion of San Francisco
would hardly look well in print. The
eccentric leader, who has a following
of .100,000 people in the world, 10,000 of
wh'om are toiling in Zion City, while
their leader lives in luxury, gave vent
to his feelings when he boarded the
Sonoma yesterday, half an hour before
the appointed sailing time.
Dowie was seen in the exquisitely
decorated bridal suite of -the vessel.
San Francisco breathes easier. John
Alexander Dowie, self-styled "Elijah,
the Redeemer," head of the Zion City
movement in Illinois, which has re
sulted in an aggregation of $25,000,000
being rjlaced in the hands of Dowie to
do as he pleases with, has departed
from these shores.
Dowie and four of his smug deacons,
well-fed, well-clothed, sailed yesterday
on the steamship Sonoma for Australia,
occupying the bridal suites, of the ves
sel.

CURED BYJOTICURA
Had Given up All Hope of Ever
Making Any Care.
" My little girl hts been Buffering for
two yori or more from eczema, and
during that time I conld Dot get a
Bijcbt'a eleep, as her ailment "was Tery
â¢crere.
" I had tried so many remedies and
spent xnnch money, deriving no bene-
fit, I had absolutely given ap all hope
of making any core. Bot as a last re-
aort I was persuaded to try a set of the
Coticara remedies, and to ray great
delight a marked change was mani-
fested from the first application. I
gave the child a li.<h with Catierr-..
Soap, using a soft piece of rnnslin cloth.
ThJs I did tvr'.ce a day, each ttmo foi-
loirinR with the Cuticara Ointment,
arid at the same time gaTe the JIesolÂ»
vrnt. according to directions. One box
of the Ointment and two bottles of the
Resolvent; together with the Soap,
effected a permanent cure. I submit
this for pablicatioa if you desire, hop-
ing it will add to yocr success and assist
so many thous^e'ds of snfferers In cor-
ing tbÂ«*msclres." Mrs. I. B. JONES,

The first sttp in the trestaent of the
chronic forms is to remove the scales
tud crusts and Bofttn the skin, by
vann baths with Cuticara Scap. The
r cilp, ears, elbows, hands, ankles aad
feet will require frequently a thorough
eoaking in order to penetrate the thick-
ened Â«kin and crests with wlÂ»?ch thesa
â¢parts are olVn covered. Dry care-
felly, and apply Ccticura Ointment,
lightly at flr.-t. and where advisable
spread it on pieces of soft cloth and
bind in place. Take the Resolvent,
pllis, or liquid, lu medium doses. Do
Dot cse cold water in bathing, and
avoid cold, raw winds.
