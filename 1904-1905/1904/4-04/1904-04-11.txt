An unusually large crowd was at
tending services at the. Mission, the
occasion being the first "muss said by
Father . Florian Zettel, who was or
dained last week. When service was
over the crowd made a dash for the
car waiting at the top of the grade,
and in a moment it was loaded to the
steps, the passengers being crushed
against one another in the aisles.
The heavily laden car started and
had not gone a block before it got be
yond the control of the motorman. The
supposition is that he did not realize
the dangerous speed of the car until
it was too late to stop the headway. At
the first curve the car lifted, but set
tled down again, but so great was the
speed that a dozen â persons . were
hurled off at the turn. It was not un
til this hair-raising -turn was made
that the passengers, mostly women and
children, realized the danger, and a
panic at once began. The shrieking
women made frantic efforts to get to
the doors. Motorman. Kelton applied
the full force of the air and locked the
wheels and Conductor Newell set the
hand brakes, but thÂ« heavy load and
the momentum caused the car to slide
with unabated speed. As a last re
course Kelton reversed the current,
but even this had Â¦ no effect, whatever,
and almost before the passengers re
alized it the car struck the second
curve and turned turtle, sliding on its
side into the curb and bringing up with
the roof against a telegraph pole.
The shock hurled every one on the
outside of the car into the' air and
when they struck the ground the car
Itself slid over them, crushing. and
grinding them under. its weight. . Those
inside the car were not badly hurt, the
The end of the street car line is situ
ated almost at the gates of the Mis
t-ion, a steep hill extending for about
two blocks to a sharp curve. The grade
continues for another block and then
takes another sharp turn on to Garden
street. It was at this second curve
that the accident occurred.
DISASTER AT A CURVE.
At 11:50 o'clock a car carrying about
120 passengers got beyond the -control
of the motorman, and after, a .mad race
down the steep grade, left thi* 'rails at
the second curve encountered, and
turned- completely over, burying its
load of human freight beneath a mass
of splintered wood and twisted iron.
Four persons were killed outrisht and
over a score were seriously injured.
One lived only a few hours.
The wreck was a frightful one and
several of the willing helpers who were
soon on the scene fainted at the shock
ing sight. The car was one of up-to
date construction and thoroughly
equipped. ! It was almost new. having
been on the road only about a week.
It was in charge of Victor Kelton. an
experienced motorman of good stand
ing with the company, and William
Newell, conductor. The car was as
large as any in use in the State and
similar to those generally operated for
long suburban trips* It was fitted with
air brakes, as well as the heavy ratchet
hand brakes.
SANTA BARBARA, April 10.â A trol
ley car accident which resulted fatally
for five persons and in which nearly
thirty mort were injured occurred this
morning near the Old Mission, a car
load of worshipers returning from
church being dashed to the ground by
the overturning of the car at a sharp
curve. :
"I can't account for it at all," said
he. "As soon as I saw that the car
was going too fast I put on the air
and then the hand brakes and the re
verse, but although the wheels locked
they wouldn't hold. I think I did
everything I could to stop the car."
Several priests from the Mission
hurried to the spot to give spiritual
consolation to the dying and one of
the Fathers fainted at<he sight. Many
of the onlookers were overcome.
The street railway here is owned
and operated by the Edison Electric
Company of Los Angeles. Experts ex
plain the accident by saying that the
rails were not large enough for the
heavy car and its great load, weigh
ing in all about forty-five tons, and
that once It got out of hand nothing
could have stopped it. They believe
the brakes acted well and that the
motorman did all he could to prevent
the disaster.
Motorman Kelton was among those
injured, being badly cut about the
head, but he was able to give a state
ment of the affair.

sition of the New: Jersey: Democracy
.In regard. to the Presidential campaign
can now be predicted by reason of the

Representative .. Hearst is the worst
beaten man who ever sought to control
the . votes of this , commonwealth. . His
advocates. will come to the convention
with practically no support, except in
NEW TORK, April 10.â Judge Park
er** nomination is conceded as inevita.
, bte by Dexaocrats throughout the na
tion who have followed the trend of
political events in the various States.
These men think the Hearst boom has
been wiped out and they say Parker
has beaten all records as an anti-con
vention candidate. The Parker senti
ment is crystallizing In Illinois, Â¦where
Hearst was first in the field and thus
far hes been getting nearly all the
State, convention delegates.
A canvass of the situation in New Jer
sey shows that there is a strong lean
ing toward Parker and that, though
Hearst made a hard, fight, the delega
tion to the national convention un
doubtedly will go uninstructefl. Friends
of Hearst see a ray of hope in Connecti
cut, where, they say, the trend cf pop
ular favor is running in his direction.
Murphy, in an interview in Atlantic
City, intimated that in the Tammany
district conventions no references for or
against instructions would be made.
Thomas Taggart, national committee
man of Indiana, says that labor unions
j^sent Hearst's effort to pnt them. in
j'* political class by themselves, and '.
Judge Parker vrill have a solid dele
pation from his State.
ALL FLOCKING TO PARKER.
WASHINGTON, April 10. â Judge
Parker's boom for the Presidency is
breaking all political records. Reports
from all over .the United States show
B condition" unprecedented in the his
tory of the Democratic party. A man
j>rÂ«icticalJy unknown outside of his
own State, but pictured as a conser
vative character who might unite the
party and win the thirty-nine electoral
votes of New York, is being taken on
trust by the Democrats of the nation.
It would seem to-night that the only
thing which cduld possibly defeat Par
ker's nomination would be a failure
of New York to instruct in the State
convention a week hence or a stam-,
l>ede for Grover Cleveland at St. Louis.
The almost certain prospect of New
York Giving instructions has practi
cally in one week wiped the Hearst
boom off the fa.ee of the earth. Hearst
has not even Kansas, though it gave
him a complimentary resolution.
Hearst has reached high tide in Ill
inois, where up to this time he had
Fwept everything before him. He has
been overwhelmingly defeated in such
primaries aÂ» have been held in Indi
ana and there the delegates will be
instructed for Parker. Kentucky,
which was regarded as a Bryan
stronghold, has surrendered to the
Parker movement.
â Th<? situation in the South remains'
unchanged. The South will be for
any conservative man whom New
York wants before' Hearst or any
other candidate supported by Bryan.
HEARST ANGERS THE UNIONS.
INDIANAPOLIS. April 10.â Thomas
Taggart. Democratic national commit
tieraan for Indiana, who has been con
ducting the fight against W. R. Hearst,
returned to French Lick this morning
and will take charge of the Parker
forces in Southern Indiana, in all coun
ties in which delegates to the State
convention -of May 12 have not been
polected. There will be a total of H37
delegates in that body. About one-half
ot these have now been selected and it
is estimated that 100 of this number are
for Hearst. In the counties in which
these delegates were obtained no fight
was made on Hearst and it is believed
that the active work of the Parker
men from now on will hold the Hearst
strength down to 150 in the convention.
Taggart has assumed the leadership of
the Parker men in the State on account
Of his extensive acquaintance and be
cause all th#> shafts of the Hearst men
have been aimed at him. Before leav
ing for French, Lick. Taggart talked
frr-ely of the outlook in this State.
"The Democrats of Indiana," he said.
â¢are for Parker and will send a solid
delegation to St. Louis for him. I Of thÂ«
delegates already selected, Parker has
six out of seven and the- proportion will
be even greater in the number that re
main to be selected, for sentiment is
< rystalli2ing against Hearst and he is
not as ctrong as he was when he first
Â»'ntpied upon his Indiana campaign.
Th*Â» Democrats believe that Hearst and
Parker are the only two men whose
names will go before the convention,
and called upon to make a choice
between them they will go to Parker
as the only man who represents Demo-!
cratic principles and as the one that
will be Etrongest before the people.
â¢;One of the reasons for the change
of sentiment since Hearst's first in*
vasion of the State is found lnl the
methods that have been adopted by
his managers. They have appealed . to
classes rather than to men as Denio
oiats. and have tried to make the im
pression that there is a movement In
union labor circles all over the coun
try for his nomination. Even laboring
men do not like to be Bet off In this
vay as a class in politics, and the re
sult in union labor . centers, where
Hearst got only nine out of the forty
one delegates selected by labor votes.

John Lloyd, who claims to be a csfn- i

Company, had a remarkable escape
from death last evening. He fell out
of a sixth story window and sustained
a contusion of the skull, a fracture
of the left arm and other injuries of
a minor character. ; .
Lloyd claims he was in a trance,
as he deliberately walked out of the
window, landing upon the" roof of
Fowzer's photograph gallery, forty
feet below. ' He was taken to the Cen- "'
tral Emergency Hospital.
Lloyd fortunately landed on .the."!,
shingles of the adjoining roof, direct
ly between the/ rafters. He went
through the thin shingles with such
force that it took the strength of four
men to extricate him from the debris. -

; NEW YORK, April ' 10.â The World
has the following from Tientsin: It Is
reported from Mukden that two trains
containing a large number of Russians
who were wounded' in, ah engagement
on the Yalu River have passed through
there on the way to Harbin!
PARIS, April 10.â The St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Petit Parisienne
cables an Interview he had with Ad
miral â¢ Rojestvensky, chief of the gen
eral staff of the navy, in the course of
which the admiral admitted that ho
had been offered and had accepted the
command of the Baltic squadron,
adding, that he was not certain
whether the squadron would go
to the Far East. The Emperor, the ad
miral said, desired the squadron to be
ready to sail by July 15 next, but this
was considered too hasty a movement
in official circles, where it was affirmed
that on the departure of the squadron
a certain complication might arise In
Europe.
"Moreover, there will not be work for
seamen in the Far East in' September,
for then," said. the admiral "the Jap
anese will have" conveyed , to Korea
sufficient cannon, ammunition and pro
visions to enable them to carry on a
campaign for many months. The Jap
anese will not hesitate to spend enor
mous sums for apparently, inadequate
results and this proves: that they, are
sure they can renew their supplies and
ammunition and that they have friends
who will furnish all they need."
Questioned concerning the Japanese
tactics,- the admiral said:
' "Vice Admiral Togo is quite right to
remain faithful to,, his. ;plan, although
the .appearances are against him. .We
know from a sure pource that he is cer
tain he can repair his vessels and renew
his supplies, even of heavy artillery, If
needful." . ' . - " .

vantage of the scheme. I
The masses spent the day in merry^
making; the sun shone brightly' and

The Emperor's sailors and soldiers in
the Far East telegraphed Easter greet
ings to their friends at home, through
the Novoe Vremya, which published in
four columns of small type telegrams
from Port Arthur, Vladivostok, Dalny,
Mukden, Harbin and other places, with
the signatures to the dispatches. The
messages breathe the deepesti.love of
country and afford striking evidence
of the religious bond uniting Russians.
The messages from Port Arthur rep
resent' every warship of Importance,
except the flagship Askold, and the
cruiser Pallada. The telegrams are
signed by the captains and other offi
cers. The telegrams from Vladivostok
were sent by, the officers of the cruis
ers Rurik and Bogatyr.
ST. PETERSBURG.* April 10.â Thl3
city was: to-day en fete and was given
up to' Easter rejoicing. The long Rus
sian feasts, which began after midnight
and continued almost to daylight, were
scarcely! ended before the' round of
Easter visits commenced. It is the
duty of every Russian at Easter to call
upon all his friends and to eat and
drink with them./ Open house was
kept everywhere and the latchstring
was out for j all. Theoretically, the
beggar of the streets enters" at will the
dining-room of the noble helps him
self to the good things of 'the table.
This, however, is no longer the case in
the metropolis and the larger towns of
the empire, but It is still literally true
in the villages and rural communities,
where no one is refused admittance.
Â£ It- is understood that/ as a result of
General Kuropatkin's .visit ' to I New
chwang, reinforcements 1 of 100,000 men
Â¦will' be -sent forward from Liaoyang.
The army organ ; announces the .ap
pointment of Major General Prince Or
beliani, a 'Circassian- nobleman,- to the
command of the Caucasian, cavalry,
brigade, newly raised for service in the
Far East. . .
A military official explained to-day
why General Kuropatkin's plan of
campaign does not contemplate a
heavy resistance of the Japanese ad
vance at the Yalu, saying:
â¢"Either defeat or victory in a battle
there would to MS.
If we lost we would have to fall back
through a difficult country. If we won
-^and I say to you that Russian strat
egy is based on the idea of victory ana
not defeatâ success would be fruitless.
We could/not follow it up without ex
posing the army to too great risks. On
account of the Japanese control of the
sea, if we pursued the .enemy into the
peninsula of Korea we would open both
flanks to a possible attack from the
rear. No, the Japanese must come on
to a point in the interior which, with
this end in view, has been : selected,
where we can follow up a crushing de
feat to the bitter end, with blow after
blow, and 'seal the fate of the cam
paign.
"Our plans on' sea and land will con
verge at a time next summer when
Vice Admiral Makaroff's fleet will be re
lieved by the arrival of reinforcements.
Then, if successful {on land, we . can
clear the sea of the enemy, cut his
communications' and the Japanese in
Korea "and Manchuria will be at our
mercy.
"The .world must not be impatient.
The prelude to this war is not yet fin
ished.'V :.-- i'VrV<J ' 'â¢ '. - : ' 'Â¦ .- , ' -''"Â¦
' ST. PETERSBURG, April 10.â The
generally expected attack on Port Ar
thur did not occur last night, although
a telegram received from Grand' Duke
Cyril reports that the enemy's ships
were sighted on the horizon. It is pre
sumed that . the Japanese were warned
of the extra precautions which - had
been taken to guard against a surprise.
There "was no Easter merry-making
at the front. Bv special dispensation
the soldier* and sailors, there were re
lieved of all religious observances on
account of the necessities of the mili
tary situation. Vice Admiral Makar
off's torpedo flotilla patrolled the open
sea, while the warships, with full
steam up, remained outside Port Ar
thur. Elsewhere throughout the thea
ter, of war all is reported quiet.

Only experts should use this solution
for drinking water, as fatal results
might follow attempts of inexperienced
pel sous to purify water and destroy '<
fever germs. But, owing to the cheap- i
ness of the preparation, the most in
experienced person, can use it in de
stroying mosquitoes and fever germs
in stagnant pools and in removing the
green slime, or frog spittle, found upon
these pools.
The Bordeaux mixture is a prepara
tion that has been in use for many gen
erations in spraying fruit trees to kill
insects and diseases and the wonderful |
extension of its utility was but recent- :
ly discovered by the Agricultural De- |
partment durinsr an experiment to find
some means of destroying diseases
which attack the watercress and otheÂ£<
aquatic vegetation. The expert dis
covered also that the presence of the"
Bordeaux solution in water had no eÂ£j_
feet upon those who drank it; that ty
phoid- fever germs were destroyed ab
solutely within an hour.
ALBANY. N. Y., April, 10.â Millions;
upon millions. of dollars annually lost|
to the people of the State of New York!
through preventable diseases is the;
keynote of the annual report of State',
Health Commissioner Lewis to tha
Governor, made public to-day.
"If the monetary value of a human'
life is assumed to be worth $5000," sal'l
Dr. Lewis, "the deaths from five of the^
preventable diseases during 1903 in this"
State represent a loss of $94,960,000.
These figures seem appalling and yet
millions upon millions can properly be
added to this sum in the loss of wages,
the expense of the care of the sick and
many other expenses incidental to the
management of these epidemics ana in
fectious diseases."
The Commissioner shows that there'
was vast opportunity and abundant
authority /n meet conditions, but ab
surdly insufficient appropriations with,
which to perform the necessary work,.
for which he believes a million dollaio
a year could be used with advantage
'. to the people of the State.
The water systems of great Â¦ cities
can be purified and stagnant and of
fensive pools can ! be eliminated. It
has been discovered that the utiliza
tion of a well-known solution will ex
terminate the typhoid fever germs in
drinking -water, destroy . the malaria
fever germs found in stagnant pools
and marshy places, as well as purify
and clarify the water supplies of the
cities. This wonderful solution also
destroys mosquitoes, and as it can be
prepared at practically no cost these
insects can be exterminated absolutely
and life at the seashore and in the
mountains made more pleasant.
It is the Bordeaux mixture, a prepa
ration of copper sulphate, lime and
water.

ing the 106 representatives from
Northern California reached Third and
Townsend streets last night at 6:30
o'clocic It was the unanimous opinion
of those who made the southern Jour
tey under the direction of the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee that the
time spent in sightseeing in the lower
portion of the State could not have
been better employed. Magnificent;
weather attended ihe travelers the en
tire round trip and afforded them the
opportunity of gleanirtg a great deal of
information concerning Southern Cali
fornia. The' improvements around San
Pedro Harbor, the transformation of
the desert about Riverside into beau
tiful orange groves and the beautify
ing of Redlands and Pasadena were
really revelations to many of those
who journeyed southward and won
for the Southern/ California-, residents
the admiration of men of the north
who had often 1 heard of the great work
done In thai section of the State but
had never appreciated its importance in
the future welfare of California-
True, it was a long trip that many
business, men had at first hesitated to
undertake, but not one of the return-
The fancy traps of the local smart
net were courteously tendered! to the
committee for the use of the guests
and, a more Imposing procession of
handsome carriages has not been seen
in California. The Country Club has
been much complimented in extending
the courtesies of its clubhouse to the
visitors and the committee, for which
Chairman A. B. Ford, who is secretary
of the club, was responsible. Rufus
P. Jennings said the entire trip was
a great success, but at no stopping
place were they better pleased with
what they saw and received than in
San Mateo.'

Great preparations had been made
by the Improvement Club to meet the
train at Sargenls Station with car
riages for the guests and a drive
through the old mission town of San
Juan, the San Juan Valley and city of
Hollister had been prepared, but owing
to the short time at the disposal of the
excursionists this plan was abandoned.

mittee from the Chamber of Commerce,
headed by President V. A. Scheller and
Mayor George D. Worswick. extended
u welcome to the California Promotion
Committee on the arrival of Its special j

toga and Los Gatos. The road runs j
Through the fruit district and the ;
pueFts were shown acres and acres of
blooming prune -trees. Every one ad
mired the country, and most of the vis
itors said it was the prettiest part of
the State they had visited. At Sara- j
topa the party visited the Three Oaks I
farm, the pretty home of the Hev. Ed
vin S. Williams. The place is located
on a hill, and a magnificent view of
th<> valley was had.
At Los Gatos quite a stop was made,
and the officials of the town, members
of the Board of Trade and business
/nen of the place met the Promotion
Committee. The visitors were shown
about the place and the resources of
the foothill town explained.
It was about 12 o'clock when the
party returned to this city. The visit
ors went at once to the Vendome Hotel, j
where luncheon was enjoyed. Many
business men of this city called and
were introduced to the members of the
committee.
During the trip to Saratoga and Los
Gatos the committee of the Chamber of
Commerce was scattered through the
visitors and particular pains were ta
ken to make all acquainted with the
beauty and development of this sec
tion.
After luncheon a phort reception was
tendered the committee at the hotel.
Shortly after 2 o'clock the party left j
by special train for Palo Alto, where a j

to-day to welcome the California Pro

was due here at 2:20 o'clock this af
ternoon, but it was an hour later be- !
fore it arrived. For this reason the |
arrangements of the committee werÂ«i j
changed and the train stopped but a
few minutes instead of spending a half
hour as anticipated. The local Board
<;f Trade had intended to show the
committee the various points of in
terest here and William J. Dingree had
made arrangements to entertain the
members at his home.

strong, spent over an hour in San Ma- I
tro this afternoon, visiting all points!
of interest and followed by a reception |
at the Burlingame Country Club,
where the tired tourists enjoyed such
refreshments as were most suited to
the occasion.. The visitors were en
thusiastic over their reception, and also
in thoir praise of the beautiful natural j
environment of the town, where na- j
ture has done what must be artificially*
accomplished in many 'sections. A !
large number of representative citi- j
zens. including a special committee of
sixteen, met the excursionists at the ;
depot and served as escorts in a drive ;
through the grounds of some of the \
most stately and magclficent homes in !

SALT LAKE, April 10.â A religious
meeting at the Nazarene Mission
Church ended in a row to-night. Mrs.
Kent White of Denver, an evangelist,
her traveling companion, <R. E. Beedlc
man, and J. A. Headlund, a local archi
tect and a member of the board of di
rectors of the church,, were arrested
for making a disturbance and taken to
the police station. -W :
Mrs. White held. nightly meetings in
the church last week. In one address
she attacked the Nazarene Church at
Los Angeles, and thereby incurred the
disapproval of some of the church
members. She was ,. requested not to
speak again. To-night, however, -she
refused; to be silenced, and, together
with Beedleman and Headlund, Is said
to have disturbed the meeting . by sing
ing and jumping about after the fash
ion of the "Holy Jumpers." .The police
were called and the arrest followed.
In the course of â¢. his sermon on the

ist) Church, yesterday morning, th*s

The Rev. William Rader said
His view that no "connection" exists between
the truth of Christianity and the traditional
notions of its historical origins" is, to my mind,
the moat significant statement in Its '.bearings
upon the fundamentals of the Christian J re
ligion.
! Canon Henson â¢ viewg on the Bible are the
generally accepted conclusions of the higher
critics, but his vlewÂ« on Christianity strike at
the very heart, not only of orthodoxy, but of
progressive orthodoxy. He not only recom
mends supplementing reading the Bible in the
church (with "Christian compositions which
have secured the approval of general accept
ance," but seriously questions accepted ver
sions of Christian truth.
Here Is a canon of Westminster who wants
an expurgated Bible, an expurgated church and
an expurgated Christianity. Christian scholar
whip might stand for the first and the second,
but hardly for the third.
I am glad that the responsibility is with the
Church of England, rather than with the Non
conformists. There Is enough truth In the
Bible and In the church to keep us all preach
ing and practicing till the end of time. .
Such articles as Canon Henson's In the Con
temporary Review are calculated to defeat
their own purpose by unsettling the minds of
the unlearned and disgusting the minds of
those who know better.
My knowledge of the religious life of Eng
land leads me to believe that, while the can
on's views on the Bible might be tolerated, his
reflections on Christianity will bring down
upon his head a torrent of criticism. Independ
ent of Â»ect or church.
It seems manifestly unfair, however, for one
to make sweeping statements of an article the
whole of which he has not read. When a man,
however, asks for the revision of 'Christianity
be places himself In -a position for criticism,
especially if he be a high dignitary of the
church..
\The province of Canterbury was instrumental
in revising the BIWe. Will the province " of
Canterbury assume the responsibility of revis
ing Christianity or will Canterbury revise the
canon? * â¢>*

He is right. But his religion, unfortunately,
rests not on this glorious eepulcher of the risen
Christ, but upon a sepulcher full of dead men's
bones â foul and loathsome, in which were laid
the corruptible bodies of licentious kings and
queena and ministers of state.
He justifies himself in part by saying that
the majority of the Knglish people do not be
lieve in the corporal resurrection of Christ.
What has this to do with the fact of the resur
rection? The majority of the Jews contempo
rary with Christ did not believe in It, and I
think that if Canon Henson had lived at that
time he would sooner have believed the state
ment of the bribed suards that the body of
the Redeemer was stolen away from the tomb
while they slept and knew nothing about what
was happening than the disinterested testi

MEMPHIS, April 10.â The Mississippi
River at this city to-night has come
to a stand after rising three-tenths of
a foot since Saturday night. It is pre

levees in the Memphis territory have
withstood the overflow and it is
thought that when the water begins to
recede all danger will be over.
Three thousand people in the village
of Verdun, adjoining the limits of Mon

MONTREAL, April 10.â Montreal is
experiencing a serious flood. Early to
day a large quantity,Â©* .ice came down
from Lake St. Louis and jammed up
against the Victoria bridge. In a few
minutes the water began to rise and in
a short, time it had reached the; top of
the dyke built after the last great flood
and which had been, up to the present
time, a sufficient protection. In a short
time it became possible to navigate all
that portion of Verdun in the neighbor
hood of the Queen's Park with boats.
All the teams that could be pressed
into service were engaged In strength
ening and raising the dyke. At 6
o'clock the water had reached, a depth
of six feet in the streets. To-night it
is falling, but the danger is by no
means over yet, as there is more ice
to come down.

"I think not, for the people of this
age are too enlightened to believe trash
of this kind."
Rev. James S. Stone of St. James
Church said:
"I don't think Henson's article
amounts to anything, although it is a
savage attack. If that is the worst he
can say, the Bible will hold its own for
all time to come. He does not make
good his assertions, and I do not take
him seriously."
In some respects Rev. R. A. White of
the Stewart Av%nue Universalist
Church agreed with the statement of
Canon Hensen.
"There is much in the Bible that we
cannot believe, and many of its teach
ings we cannot follow,"- said he. "It is
simply a chronicle of the times in many
parts. It grew up Uke all other re
ligions; it is simply an outgrowth of
the spirit of the times and the teach
ings of the men of those days. I think
the Bible is a great piece of literature.
But I view it as I do all other erreat
pieces of literature. We -must pick out
those things which are applicable to
our present conditions of society. Some
of the ethics are perfect and some of
them are villainous. Yet we cannot
throw it aside simply because some o*
It is absurd and unworthy of belief."
When asked if he thought Canon
Henson's views would have any effect
on the people, Bishop Fallows replied:
CHICAGO, April 10.â Bishop Fallows
and the Episcopal ministers of Chicaco
unite in denouncing Canon Henson of
Westminster Abbey, who, in the Con
temporary Review of London, attacked
the Bible, and especially the Old Tes
tament, calling it "a pack of lies" and
declaring it to be "demoralizing and
too gross for toleration."
When asked how he regarded Canon
Henson's statement. Bishop Fallows of
St. Paul's Reformed Episcopal Church,
replied:
"He is off his base. His are not the
sentiments of the man, but rather of
a critic who is not in a position to criti
cize the Bible. The grand old Bible
will withstand all attacks, but I can't
help regretting that such sentiments
come from a man holding such a re
sponsible position. I believe, the man
is seeking notoriety."

His (Henson's) religion un
fortunately rests not on this
glorious sepulchre of the risen
Christ, but upon a sepulchre
full of dead men's bones- â foul
and loathsome, in which were
laid the corruptible bodies of
licentious Kings and Queens and
Ministers of State. â Rev Father
11. H. Wyman of San Francisco.
I do not think Henson's ar
ticle amounts to anything, al
though it is a savage attack. If
that is the worst he can say, the
Bible will hold its own for all
time to come. He does not make
good his assertions, and I do not
take him seriously.â Rev. James
D.> Stone of Chicago.
T think the Bible is a great
piece of literature. Some of the
ethics arc perfect and some are
villainous. Yet we cannot throw
it aside simply because some of
it is absurd and unworthy of be
lief. â Rev. R. A. White or Chi
cago. \ ' \ .
His (Henson's) are not the
sentiments of the man, but
rather of a critic who is not in
a position to criticize the Bible.
The grand old Bible will with
stand ull attacks, but I can't
help regretting: that such senti
ments conic from a man hold
ing such a responsible position.
I believe the man is seeking
notoriety. â Bishop Fallows of
Chicago.
I have not seen - the Review
article in full and, to comment
upon it intelligently, one ought
to have before him all the man
has said and not mere extracts.
â Bishop Nichols of California.
I am glad the responsibility is
with the Church of. England,
rather than with the Noivi-con
forniists. There is enough
truth in the Bible and in \ the
church to keep us all preaching
and practicing till,, the end
time. â Rev. Wiliam Rader of
San Francisco.
Views of Canon
Henson's Critics
The principle sermon was by Presi
dent Joseph Smith. The address was
an able review of Mormon history of
recent years and a denial of the charge
that the book of Mormon teaches or
advocates polygamy. The speaker
maintained that the contrary was the
case, that the Book of Mormon taught
with the Bible that one husband should
have one wife and one wife one hus
band. President Smith said that the
great body of the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
were firm believers in tne laws of God
and of his guidance of the affairs of
this country and were therefore loyal
citizens because of their adherence to
the teachings of God.
Another able address was that of
Apostle Herman C. Smith of Lamoyne,
Iowa, who is well known as an orator.
Many - persons were deeply affected by
Apostle Smith's eloquent address and
shed tears. He spoke to the text: "I
Am Come That Thou Might Have LlfÂ«
and Have It More Abundantly."
KIRTLAXD. Ohio, April 10.â There
were 1200 people present at to-day's re
ligious exercises of the annual confer
ence of the Reorganized Church of Je
sus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The
day was given up entirely to preaching
and religious exercises, the sermons be
ing delivered by President Joseph
Smith in the morning. Apostle Herman
C. Smith in the afternoon and Richard
C. Evans of London in the evening.

REVIEWS mSTORY OF
THE MORMON* CHURCH
ENGLISH ECCLESIASTIC WHO "HAS
ATTACKED THE BIBLE, AND TWO
OF HIS DISTINGUISHED CRITICS.
LOS ANGELES. April 10.â Edwin M.
Sweeney, who for a brief period was a
Police Judge In San Francisco, ar
rived hens to-night from Yuma so
weak from illness that his friends fear
he will not survive the week. His
wife was telegraphed for, and It is not
probable that she will be able to take
him back to San Francisco alive. He
is suffering from consumption, and
fully realizes his condition.
But for an experience he had with
robbers at Yuma, a blow he sustained
and the fright the attack caused, he
probably would be able to be about.
In fact, his trip to Arizona might have
benefited him. On March 18 robbers
entered his room, and while they were
et work he returned to it. As he
opened the door one of the thieves
struck him a violent blow in the face,
knocking him down. Then they stole
everything of value which he possessed,
including most of his clothing.
The next day a negro named Davis,
whom Sweeney had employed as his
6ervant, and whom he had befriended
!n many ways, was found wearing a
portion of the stolen clothing and was
arrested. Later another man was ar
rested for participation in the crime,
but the case acaJnst him was dis
missed. Sweeney was greatly weakened
by the assault, but despite the fact that
he knew his life depended upon a
rhange of climate, he remained in
Yuma to prosecute Davis, and on Sat
urday the negro was convicted of
burglary in the first degree. He will
be sentenced Monday. Sweeney then
determined to return to San Francisco,
but when he reached Los Angeles his
rendition was such that he had to be
conveyed to a hotel and his relatives
summoned.

SALT LAKE, April 10.â As a result
of â¢ the reorganization of the operating
departments of the Harriman roads
there has been wage reductions which
have caused a large amount of discon
tent among the employes.
That portion of the Union Pacific
west of Green River. Wyo., and all of
the Southern Pacific east of Wads
worth, ICev.. were added to the Ore
gon Short Line system a few days
ago as far as operation is concerned.
One of the first results has been the
discharge of every Southern Pacific
and Union Pacific employe on these
portions of the road, ?all being imme
diately rehired. In a large majority
of cases salaries have been reduced 10
to 50 per cent.
In every Instance the men thus re
employed have lost all their seniority
rights. Some employes have been with
the Union Pacific or Southern Pacific
over twenty-five years. They have no
more standing now than absolutely
new men. The yard forces in Ogden
have been greatly reduced and there is
a cutting down wherever possible.
8pÂ«clU Dispatch to The Call.
Michael Gilbride, with . a- serious stab
wound .over his heart, evaded the
police-
The fight lasted a half hour. When
the police reserves arrived they sent
Thomas and William Gilbride to the
hospital and arrested the two
McShanes, ' who were bleeding from a
dozen wounds.
Then Harry McShane attacked Wil
liam Gilbride. and inflicted several
wounds. The men fought their way
out of the saloon and continued the
battle in the street, causing a crowd to
collect that blocked the surface cars
and led to the calling out of, the police
reserves. ,
NEW YORK, April 10.â In a feud
fight here to-day three brothers,
Thomas, "William and Michael Gilbride,
were seriously, if not fatally, stabbed,
and Harry and, John McShane, also
brothers, were â¢ badly wounded.
On Saturday a fight occurred between
Harry McShane and Thomas Gilbride
and both were arrested. To-day, meet
ing Gilbride and his two brothers on
the street^with several of , their. friends.
McShane gathered about twenty of his
friends in the back room of a saloon
at thS corner of First g avenue and
Twenty-third street. Then, according
to the " police, he approached ; Gilbride,
professed regret over their trouble of
the day before, and finally induced the
Gilbride party to go with him to the
saloon to drink and forget their dif
ferences. As soon as all were inside
the 'saloc-n, McShane is said to have
given a signal, at which, his friends
began the fight.
Harry McShane devoted - his energy
to Tom Gilbride, and used a long-bladed
jackknife on his adversary. The fight
between these two nien lasted five min
utes and Gilbride fell to the floor in
sensible and bleeding profusely from a
jagged cut in the abdomen and another
cut o-n the shoulder.

the academic year 1903-1904. The
scholarship, if properly taken advan
tage of, may continue for three years.
It is understood that this will not
be a distinctly competitive examina
tion. It is designed merely as a test
in order to make sure that the elected
member would be- able, should he
have been required, to pass the Ox
ford responsions. the matriculation ex
aminations for that university and the
lowest test required of the lowest man
that is allowed to continue work there.
The second Rhodes scholar will be
selected next year from among the
students of Stanford University. Every
.seventh year one Rhodes scholar will
be chosen from the smaller colleges of
California considered as a group. .The
California committee on Rhodes schol
arships includes President Wheeler as
chairman. President David Starr Jor
dan of Stanford University and Pro
fessor E. C. Norton of Pomona Col
lege.
This delay will give the committee in
charge of the projected celebration over
the entrance of the first Santa Fe
train into Oakland two weeks longer in
which to complete its programme.
General Manager A. G. Wells of the
Santa Fe has sent out official notifica
tion of the selection of the later date
to the chairman of the celebration
committee, M. J. Keller, and to J: J.
Warner, the Santa Fe commercial
agent in this city. General Manager
Wells said he regretted the delay, but
it was â¢ unavoidable.
Opening of the Santa Fe railroad
operations in Oakland has been post
poned to May 15. The long continued
wet weather so seriously interfered
with construction work at the new de
pot and yards that the delay is nec
essary. May 1 was originally selected
at a time when It was thought every
thing would be In readiness. .
With fair weather the remainder of
this month and up to the date In May
which has been selected for the ' for
mal opening of business, the Santa Fe
people think there will be no difficulty
in getting things Into shape for the

OAKLAND, April 10.â It was a case
of two men with four revolvers against
four men without any revolvers in the
holdup at the store of G. A. Grimes,
on the corner of the Redwood road
and School street last night. . The two
men with the four revolvers won. The
victims of the holdup were G. A.
Grimes, proprietor of the store; James
A. Clark, a carpenter living on Red
wood road; Stephen A. Tuttle, a mill
hand, and a man named Sweetman.
Grimes says that as near as he can
figure the robbers got $75 from him,
and he thinks they probably took
about $25 from the other three men in
the store. He tells the following story
of the holdup:
As near as I can fix the time now, the rob-
I think both of the njen were amateurs at
the business, for they were very nervous. As
thÂ«y were both masked. I don't think I would
know either of them again if I should see
them. As soon as we thought it was sale, we
went cut and gave the alarm. .
In the meantime the other man had robbed
the three customers, and then the two of them
backed to the door, the man that had taken
the money from me saying: "Don't any of
you come outride until we get to our horses
or we'll shoot you full of holes," and then
thpy slipped out of the door. I don't think
they had any horses, for we did not hear any;
but I do believe that they were provided with
bicycles", for we did not hear a sound after
they got out of the store.
DESPOILS' -CUSTOMERS.
I saw that I would have to give up what
gold there was In the drawer, so I pulled it
all the way out. and the robber said: "That's
right: now dump !t on the counter," and I
did so and he dropped one of his guns Into
the side pocket of hts coat and kept the other
aimed at me while he picked ud the money.
drawer wider so I can see If there is any
more there."
I was In the store, waiting upon Mr. Sweet

Tuttle came In. While' we were talking I saw
two men pass the window on the north side
of the door and a minute later they came into
the store. AÂ» they started through -the door
I taw that they were masked and that each
of them carried two pistols. I thought it was
some of the boys in the neighborhood playing
a Joke on me; but when one of the fellows, who
was a tali, spare man. shoved his pistol against
me and told me to open the till and hand over
the money I knew that I was up against the
genuine article." I opened the cash drawer and,
taking out what silver there was in it. handed
It across the counter to the man, but he re

This evening Dr. Hitchcock gave an
illustrated lecture, showing, some of
the noted buildings of the world and
what they typified. Among them were
the citadel of Cairo, built to ambition;
the pyramids, typifying death; the
coliseum, standing for passion and
pleasure; the. Louvre in Paris, the
home of art; the Claus Spreckels build
ing in San Francisco, typifying busi
ness, and the new church for his con
gregation, representing a fitting home
for the Christ.
ALAMEDA, April 10.â Twenty-flve
thousand dollars was subscribed to-day
toward the building fund of the $35,
000 house of worship to be erected by
the First Congregational Church.- Of
this amount $22,530 was contributed at
the morning services and the remain
der at the evening exercises. It was
the. largest church subscription . ever
recorded in a single day in the history
of Alameda, and the pastor of the First
Congregational Church, Rev. L. Potter
Hitchcock, and the trustees are highly
pleased with the moral and financial
support given the project,'. to the pro
motion of which they have devoted
their undivided energy for two years.
To-day's munificent cash offerings
mean that it will be but a short' time
before the corner-stone will be laid.
Dr. Hitchcock's method of acknowl
edging"the subscriptions as rapidly as
they were made was a novel and strik
ing one. NeaT the pulpit he had rest
ing on an easel a 6x4-foot picture, rep
resenting a pile of rocks. Each rock
bore on its tace values running from
$75 to $5000. When a. rock was pur
chased with a contribution It was re
moved, and as the pile Became smaller
there was disclosed behind the rocks a
perspective of the proposed new 'home
for the congregation. When the con
tributors ceased buying rocks this
evening the pile looked as if -it had
been blasted with dynamite. There is
not much of it left, and what remains
can be secured cheap, as the higher
priced rocks have all been disposed of.
Before soliciting donations Dr.
Hitchcock delivered an address lead
ing up to the point and the pile of
rocks. He said In part:
Reading my Bible the other day. I came
across a secret by which we make our dream
of a new church possible. This secret leaked
out In a meeting: of the trustees two months
ago and your pastor wrote down the unani
mous belief of the board. If this secret be
manifest among the people, then we will build
the church. I have felt that It would be
wrong for me to withhold the secret, and so,
even If I Incur the displeasure of the board of
trustees, I am going to divulge that secret.
During the last few menths Alameda has
been awakening from a sort of Rip Van Winkle
slumber. Grand things have been done in the
past to make our city a delightful place, and
the oftener you xtray array the more thankful
you are that Alameda belongs to you. But we
have been resting on past laurels and others
have been outstripping us In the race, and
many a blessing of prosperity has slipped by
us and gone to another. But now, with the
railroad matter settled, we have unearthed
the one talent we rolled up and burled in a
napkin of indifference some years ago, and we
have begun to put It to use and on all sides
we are hearing, "Alameda to the fore!" Now
we are looking over what we have donÂ» In
the past and studying means for future better
ments. -....'...'
One of the most important deals in
county real estate is the recent sale of
the Mer\Jwa stock farm at Pleasanton,
formerly owned by R. E. de B. Lopez,
and transferred by him through the
Bank of Livermore to J. Butler, a
millionaire horse-owner of New York,
who will use the place as a training
and breeding farm. Mr. Butler has
recently purchased about forty-five
young horses, all of which will be put
Into training at Merriwa at once.
J. J. Mason of Berkeley reports the
sale last Tuesdaj' of a piece of prop
erty on the corner of Addison street
and Shattuck avenue, 138x150 feet, to
Fred A. Dakin, a manufacturer of
hollow concrete stone, and the pur
chaser will soon begin the erection of
a three-story business block of this
material. Th,e purchase price of this
property is reported to have been $35,
000.
Berkeley real estate is in great de
mand by homeseekers. especially since
the Alcatraz avenue line is to be ex
tended to Bancroft way. and in this
vicinity prices have steadily advanced
until in some cases values are double
what they were' two or three years
ago. Among the recent deals reported
by W. C. Moran of South Berkeley are
the following:
Building lot on Fairview street, sold
to C. H. Dimick; residence on Grant
street, sold to F. C. Nickle by J. Alme
felt: building lot on Fairview street,
sold to A. M. Jones; building lot on
Fairview street, sold to Nathan
Pushie: cottage at 1623 Oregon street,
rented to Benjamin Rheinholdt. Mr.
Moran also reports that Architect J.
C. Halloway has asked for bids for
the erection of a building on McGee
street, which will be occupied by James
Stephens, and that L. Biermith is hav
ing plans drawn for the construction
of a two-story dwelling on. King
street which is to be occupied by him
self and family.
CORNER DIS" SED OF.
Another important transaction was
the purchase by Daniel P. Durst of a
large tract of land near Fortieth street
and San Pablo avenue. The property
is a part of the Coggeshall Tract and
was sold to Durst by Mrs. Eliza H.
Scotchler. It is understood that the
purchase price was $35,000. A tract
of sixty acres near Fruitvale was re
cently purchased by Mr. Durst, the
price paid being $60,000.
LARGE TRACT SOLD
.The spring realty market has open
ed up in earnest and dealers in Oak
land real estate have their hands full
supplying the wants of buyers and an
swering inquiries from prospective
purchasers. Market conditions are the
pa me in Alameda and Berkeley and
from present indications Alameda
County real estate will be in greater
demand than at any other time since
1 property on this side of the bay was
first placed on the market.
So far the activity has not been con
fined to residence property, several
large deals in business property hav
ing been recently closed, among them
being a lease between C. H. King, the
East Oakland capitalist and the Poly
technic Business College for the erec
tion of a four-story building on the
corner of Twelfth and Har
rison streets. This lease was closed
by the Laymanee Real Estate Com

â¢ ThrÂ«Â»e quartets of a square block of
buildings. $25,000 loss and one man
injured seriously and another painful
ly is the record of a lire that started
year the corner of Ninth and Frank
lin streets this evening and swept
through a mass of Chinese opium
joints, cheap lodging houses and
stables. While the fire was in a lot
of old rookeries ii was s=till in the heart
of town and the very fact that the
buildings were old and flimsy made it
dangerous for better structures that
surrounded them.
The lire was discovered shortly af
ter 10 o'clock in the rear of a stable
operated by A. S. Hanks on Franklin
street, midway between Eighth and
Ninth streets. The fire is believed to
have originated from a spark that was
dropped on the ilimsy old stable from
the plumbing shop of Barker & Kin
r.Â«?y. just across Ninth street. By the
time it was discovered the rear of the
llodel lodging house on the corner of
Ninth and Franklin streets had caught
lire and when the engines arrived the
corner was in a fierce blaze. The
buildinps were so liimsy that the fire
thread with great rapidity and it wus
only by the greatest efforts that the
Webster street frontage and a portion
of the Eighth street frontage was
â¢caved.
Â¦BRISK BOMBAKDMKNT.
When the fire got into one of the
Chinese stores on Ninth street it
reached 10,000.000 firecrackers that
mere being saved for the next Chinese
New Year, and for several minutes
there was a bombardment of firecrack
ers and bombs that made a lively ac
companiment to the fire.
The carriage manufactory of Sohst
Brothers, on the corner of Eighth and
Franklin streets, was saved after a
fight. Most of the stock was saved and
the building was but little damaged.
.Tom Magee's expensive automobile was
in the shop, but it was not seriously
injured. The Sohst shop was saved
by the new Monitor that was put at
work for the first time.
Nearly all of the places burned were
rioted and notorious." The Model lodg
ing-house on the corner was built by
Dr. Ambrose Saunders. Thp building
was constructed in violation of the fire
ordiances and in the building Dr.
Saunders uas arrested several times.
He has since sold the property to T.
Â¦Donohue.
Just behind the Model lodging
house were several small shops
and then came Chin Fook's
Chinese meat shop, the proprie
tor . being one of the wealthy
residents of Chinatown. Then came
the famous old opium joint that was
recently raided by Sergeant Clark.
These places were entirely destroyed.
The Chinese Mission on Franklin
street, next to . Sohst's shop, was de
stroyed. It was owned by S. Keane.
The Webster-street frontage was not
injured.
BOSSES ARE SAVED.
The two-story house on Eighth street
owned and occupied by W. Avan was
entirely destroyed. The rest of the
property to the corner of Webster
street was formerly owned by C. J.
Wetmore and escaped with but littl*?
damage. The stable of Fred Becker
on Eighth street, owned by Avan, was
destroyed, but all of the horses and
rigs were saved.
..W. I. Heyn and Deputy County Clerk
Charles Pugh arrived on the scene in
time to save sixteen horses and most
of the rigs from Hanks' stable on
Franklin street. E. E. Laymanee was
f arly en the scene and did good work
in saving property.
The only men injured were Fred
Jeffries, sixty years of age, who jump
ed from the second story of the lodg
ing house, and F. M. French, who hurt
his hand in saving property.

PROGRESS OF IRRIGATION*
. WORK IX THE WEST
Construction Operations Along Salt
jj and Truckee Rivers Is Pro
; . . ceeding Rapidly.
WASHINGTON, April 10.â The prog
ress made in the irrigation work of the
Government is reviewed in a 'publica
tion issued by the, Geological Survey,
which points', out the necessity ; for
great caution and conservatism in, the
expansion of the reclamation work. It
says that of the irrigation projects fav
orably reported in 1903, which included
those on the Truckee '.River in Nevada;
on the Salt River in'ATizona: on the
Milk River in Montana; on Sweetwater
River in Wyoming and on Gunnison
River in Colorado, the Nevada and
Arizona projects have been found feas
ible and construction on the engineer
ing works 'along the -Truckee and Salt
rivers has progressed to a reasonable
extent. m
The Montana project, however, has
presented unexpected -engineering diffi\
culties, ' as well as ' complications ' re-'
gardlng water rights, so that progress
is slow. It has been found necessary
to modify the first plans in order to
achieve early results. The Wyoming
project, as first outlined, has i been
found impracticable. A; better reser
voir sight than that on the Sweet
water River, however, has been; dis
covered on the North Platte, so that a
large system of development -may be
worked out there in the future. Â¦-,,Â¦
Engineering difficulties are encoun
tered in the i Colorado project. â¢
The census bureau, in a preliminary
report on irrigation in- New Mexico in
1902, shows 254,945 acres irrigated from
all sources.-. The number of farms rep
resented was 9285 and the. average cost
per irrigated acre $16 87. Since 1893
the irrigation area has Increased 51,052
acres, or twenty-five per cent; while
the Increase for the decade of 1889-39
was over. 122 per cent. Â¦ \ .
Warm Weather Causes Thousands to
Seek the- Beachâ Serious Acci
dent to Samuel Nelson.
Large crowds availed themselves of
the opportunity' to get a good breath
of ocean air yesterday, gnd the beach
around the Cliff House and for miles to
the southward was "thronged with pic
nickers, many whole families Enjoying
the cool ocean breezes. Scampering
children waded in shallow water and
basked on the sands along the ocean's
edge.
The day was a perfect one and it
seemed that all San Francisco w'as out
to have a good time in the open air,
after the long siege of rain and storms/
Samuel Nelson, who was spending
the day at the beach, met with an acci
dent while attempting to open a soda
water bottle. The bottle burst and a
piece of glass struck him in the eye.
He was taken to the Park Hospital and
later removed to his home on Mission
street. He may lose the sight of the
injured eye.

| The prayer to the Immaculate Virgin,

I^ord an<r become his' 'mother, immaculate' in

on the wretched ones who, implore thy power
ful patronage. The evil serpent, against whom
was hurled the first curse, unhappily continues
to attack and bejruile the poor children of Eve.
But do thou, oh blesped mother, our queen
and advocate, who from the first i instant of
thy conception didst crush the enemy's head,
receive the prayers which, united with thee in
one heart, we conjure thee to present, before
the throne of God, that we may never be led
Into the snares that are belne woven for us,
so that all may reach the port of salvation,
and the church and Christian society,' in spite
of all the perils that environ them, may sine
again the hymn of liberation, victory and
peace. Amen,

In education lies thÂ« hope of the
world. In proportion to the education
of Its people does a country take rank
In the assembly of nations. Therefore
it is that governments have seen fit to
enact "compulsory education" lawsâ
and among them, rather tardily, how
ever, has the State of California framed
laws upon the subject. In 1874 the
State passed the first compulsory edu
cational measure, but It lay practically
Inert upon the statute books until a
new law was framed at the last Legisla
ture^ â and It was for the passage of
this vital measure that the women's
clubs of this and other cities labored
early and lateâ even sending delega
tions to Sacramento to further the In
terests of the bill.
But having- a law on the books and
enforcing that law are two -widely di
vergent conditions. That the law is
being violated daily In San Francisco
Is a well-known fact to any observer â
that Is, Jf he is searching for the truth
and really wants to find It.
Girls and boys under 14 are occupied
In various stores, about town In vari
ous capacities, mostly as cash bearers,
and are thus deprived of the benefits
cf the public schools. "Dont they go
to night school?" No. good friend. The
night school can't receive pupils under
14â according to the charterâ end there
you are!
In order to have definite Information
uj>on the number of children not per
mitted to receive their natural rights,
the city was divided Into districts for
Investigation, the South Park Settle
ment accepting the district in which it
Is locatedâ the territory confined be
tween Harrison and Channel streets.
Fourth and the water front.
On Saturday at the annual meeting
of the philanthropic body the results of
the investigation were given out.
Miss.Ludle Eaves, a university wo
man with special training for settle
ment work, rendered the report and
v. Hh the accuracy typical of the train
ed mind, rendered a succinct account
of the wort.
In the district mentioned It was
found that 432 children between the
ages of five and seventeen were not
attending any school, public or pri
vate. I have not at hand the num
ber of thesp children that are at work,
but jio doubt a goodly proportion will
be found to be wage-earners, while the
larger number, alas! belongs to tin
"truant" class â "truant." sometimes
with the parents' knowledge, if not
consent. And it is this class with which
Ihe Board of Education has to do â
with which the truant officers have to
do, and It is from this idle class that
- nminals are recruited. If you doubt
it. examine the old school register
\\ hrre the present day criminals were.
in their boyhood, nominal pupils. The
principals of the city schools can throw
much light on the early careers of
many of them.
To be sure, many an exemplary citi
~.<jn â and bia father before him â played
"hookey" when fishlnjr was good, or a
â¢ ircus in to*.vn. But that class of lads
is. of course, not included In "he "tru
ar.'s" here discussed.
Now. what remains to be done with
those 422 children â and their compa
triots all over the city â that are denied
the richts that the Government has ;
guaranteed to them? Here is the prob
lem thnt transcends any other before
tho .State to-day.
Educate our youth, by force, if we
rr.ust. but educate them. But how can
we get at them? H*Â»re is the problem.
The Forum Club presents an inter

On Wednesday next Miss Agnes G.
Jlurphy of London, a clever and witty
exponent of club life in the English
capital, will talk informally upon club
matters. Vocal numbers >vill be given

On the following, day Mrs. J. R.
Hanify will direct the programme,
Â¦which will be along the lines of Irish
wit and humor. .
On the following Wednesday the
election occurs, when Mrs. Henry
Payot. the president who has guided
the club through two years of splen
did success, will retire. But it is
doubtful if her retirement from office
âwhich, by the way. was by her
earnest request â will diminish her In
trrest in her club, or the club in her.
Their affection is mutual. I might
yenture to add that Mr. Payot Is held
very close in the affection of the club,
end for good reason â since he has
taken the members over the whole
civilized world with himâon canvas.
And his talks have always been a rare
joy.

The devout residents of several Indiana towns were
forced' this year to attend Easter services through the
medium of boats, wending their watery way through
canalsj that had been streets. Among the compensating
elements of the occasion, however, were the fact that the
fellows that prayed for rain shared the disadvantages of
their success and nobody had to dig in his jeans to buy
that bugbear of the masculine heart, the Easter bonnet.
' TcTthe' generosity of the late W. C.
Ralston is credited a story of how he
helped a young man to start In life
by advancing him $100. The benefi
ciary himself, who is at the present
a prosperous hardware merchant In
this city, tells how he made for him
self a business which lifted him from
poverty to independence.
Blank was strapped, as he tells the
story, and on hearing of Ralston's lib
erality, he stepped Into the California
Bank one morning and asked if he
could speak to Mr. Ralston. The boy
at the prlvate^door inquired his busi
ness, remarking at the time that the
manager was busy- just \ then ..and
would see no one except on banking
business. "Well," replied the young
man, "mine is banking business."
When Ralston was informed of the
request he gave instructions to have
the visitor admitted. The boy walked
In with as much confidence as if he
had a million dollar load on his
shoulders and, without waiting to be
catachised, 'he made his business
known In these words: "Mr. Ralston,
I am a poor boy with a mother to sup
port; my father is dead and if I had
$100 I would makeV a start in busi
ness and become rich. I promise td
repay the money at some time."
Impressed by the boy's candor the
generous Ralston handed him an or
der on the cashier for the amount
asked and . passed on to other matters
demanding his attention, considering
that ". the advance would \ help a j poor
woman and maybe eive the boy a
start. It did. The boy bought a lot
of cutlery, which he peddled about the
streets until eventually he was enabled
to open a little store on Bush street.
Thence he moved Into more commo
dious quarters and to-day he is at
the head of a large hardware store,
easily amassing a fortune.' Just be
fore Ralston's death the money was
paid to the California Bank at a time
when Ralston himself needed financial
aid to ; help meet the crash that sent
him to his untimely grave.

It'is the purpose of the Democrats to have 4000 seats

Every seat will be occupied. Every occupant will have a

They are beginning to realize th%
fac&in Russia that there is little glory
In war, and that it is immensely cost
ly. Now that the sea route between
European and Asiatic Russia is closed,
and the trans-Siberian line \ is monopo
lized by the military authorities, trade
is at a standstill. Deducting the
amount required by law to be held as
security for outstanding paper .cur
rency, the gold in the Imperial Bank
amounts to 533,000,000 rubles; but the
whole of this balance could be em
ployed as a war fund only at the risk
of greatly disturbing the course of ex
change and impairing the credit of the
Government. The Turkish war cost
Russia 1,000,000,000 rubles, and It is
unlikely that the cost of the present
conflict will be less. The authorities
are agreed that the country is taxed
to the limit. Where Is the money
necessary to the conduct of the j war
to come from? This is the- question
which will call more and more insist
ently for an answer as the struggle

Over 120.000 citizens of the United
States now annually visit foreign coun
tries, and their expenditures constitute
a formidable claim upon the country
to be settled In International trade by
shipments of merchandise in excess of
imports. It is commonly calculated
that, the average expenditure per capita
is $100j9, but this is probably too high
an estimate, since a large majority of
the travelers are unquestionably people
of moderate means. An estimate of
$700 per person would doubtless be liber
al, but on this calculation an aggregate
yearly expenditure of nearly $90,000,000
is reached, which constitutes so much
of claim upon the material resources of
the country. The. return benefits are
greatly beyond calculation* but they
are not of a material character. Quite
as interesting and significant is the
higher class passenger movement of
passengers other fian cabin â those who
go abroad irr the steerage. This move
ment has attained noteworthy propor
tions. Thirty years ago it averaged
about 60,000 persons yearly. During the
past two decades it rose to about 140,000
yearly on the average. < Last year it
numbered 206,494 persons, and the pres
ent fiscal year. Judging from reports of
steamship companies, will show a still
larger outward rush. These figures
must represent immigrants or aliens
who have acquired some little money
frx>m their labor in the. United States,
and are going back home either to re
main for the rest of their days or until
conditions of employment In the States
have improved. They come back, if
at all, as immigrants, presumably,
as the Government figures \ In
no other way account foT their
return. They represent a great
increase of floating labor, and a
great extension of the practice among
the poor of Europe to go to the United
States for temporary employment.

To the small island colony of New
Zealand nature has been most bounti
ful in the contrasting variety and prod
igality of her gifts, for within the lim
ited area of the land of the Moa are to
be found the greatest geysers on Â«arth,
the highest waterfall of the universe,
the most extensive ice field in the ex
plored world, fjords that excel the fa
mous inland bays of Norway and Clin
ton Valley which, with its thousand
feet bluffs reared against the perpetual
snow-capped ranges of the southern
Alps, threatens to challenge constant
comparison with the wondrous beauties
of the more famous Yosemite.
Where nature has been so lavish it
reems but reasonable that man should
be encouraged to great experiments,
ftnd New Zealand has proudly risen to
expectations by embarking on a tide of
progressive legislation which for some
time past has commanded the close at
tention of all civilized people. New Zea
land was the first of all British com
munities to grant the franchise to
women, the first to elect women to civic
office and the first to admit women to
the practice of law in the public courts
of the colony â departures which have
ell been amply Justified by results.
But It has not been alone in encour
aging concessions to what an eminent
divine has described as the "fairer, wiser
end better sex" that Maoriland has held
up the torch to modern advancement,
but In all sections having as a common
goal the "greatest pood to the greatest
number" and something beneficial for
everybody. Land purchase has become
legalized under the 999 years' lease sys
tem which makes it easily possible for
every fairly industrious settler to be
the proprietor of a farm of his own se
lection. Under the fostering care of the
government a state savings bank has
been established where the mpÂ« mod

The investment of capital is protected
in such a manner that for years past
money has been pouring into the col

has reached the high-water mark of
unprecedented general prospertiy. For
the working classes there is an act
which enforces the eight-hour-a-day
principle, with one-half holiday every
week and 6pecial provisions for the em
ployment of Juvenile laborers in fac
tories, and there is further a govern
ment labor bureau which supplies free
all information w ith regard to rates .
and the demand and supply in the vari
ous districts of the itland. For the
benefit of both capital and labor there
has been passed an arbitration bill
under which all difputes are adjusted,
and strikes made illegal, so that the
two great factors in economic develop
ment may keep on their road encour

The housing of the poor, the provision
of old age pensions for respectable col

drifted them beyond wage earning pos
sibilities and the reform measures
adopted for the reclamation of children

on lines of liberal advancement that
bave compelled, even fascinated the in
terest of more lethargic law-makers In
all parts of the world. Even while the
somewhat eruptive idol of Birmingham,
Joseph Chamberlain, sat preparing his
first pronouncement on preferential
trade. New Zealand, bold and active as
ever in decisive legislation, set to work
and within the short period of twenty
four hours enacted a measure of fiscal
reform, thus leaving him a follower,
not a leader, in the great scheme of

In 1870, when this supply was all
used up, a Boer, Mr. VHJoen of Pre
toria, printed a fresh lot. These lasted
two years and then a Mr. Borrius, at
Potchefstrom. did a little more stamp
printing.
The British seized all the stamps of
the republic remaining in the jxm
offlce and printed over them "V. R..
Transvaal," the V. R. abovjs the name
of the State. -The printers worked un
der some pressure, so naturally there
were a few errors.
A famous one is a penny red on blue,
with the name of the State spelled
"Transveal.'" The stamps with these
errors are so rare that experts value
them at from $375 to $750 a piece.
There were other errors, all of im
portance now to the philatelist. One
shows the overprint Inverted on the
stamps. A rare print of .one- of these
is valued at $1000.
South Africa, through all its many
changes, but it is supposed to be as
nearly perfect as a stamp collection
ever was. It brought nearly $20,000, a
record price.
E. J. Nankivell made the collection,
and has made a great thing out of it.
chiefly a great demand has
sprung up for the rare stamps since
the Transvaal became a British col
ony. There have been so many polit
ical changes In the country that Its
stamps form a sort of historic record
of thirty-five years.
The first and most sought for group
in the lot is that issued by the first
South African republic between I860
and 1877. The plates for these were
made in Gustrow, Germany, and tho
first supply was sent to the Transvaal
with the plates.
"Humph," said' Dewey, "he happens
to be right." Then he dismissed the
officers, but told Reardon to remain.
Inside of ten minutes the sailor was
again' donning his rubber suit. Just

Joe Reardon, a big strapping young
Irishman, has the reputation of be
ing the best diver in the United States
naval service. He has earned it by
doing stunts below the surface of
nearly every Â»ea Qn which Uncle Sam's
war vessels have nailed. Neither
depth nor. pressure have terrors for
him and therefore he is in constant
demand. The rules of the service give
the man the privilege of refusing. to
don a helmet and suit. He cannot
be compelled to dive, and It is to Joe's
credit that only once during his long
service has he refused to explore the
depths. This was at Cavite, shortly
after the sinking of the Spanish ves-.
sels, when efforts* were beinc made to
recover the bodies of the slain and
to save what remained of the battered
Spanish hulls. Then he refused be
cause the doctor on his ship,' the
Olympia, a stickler for discipline, re
fused him a glass of whisky.
Reardon had been at work all
morning on one. of the sunken vessels.
He sent up body after body and all
sorts of ship's gear and mitde fast to
the wreck numberless ropes and guys
for the use of the engineers who
were arranging 'to save the vessels.
When finally he came to the surface
at noon lie was tired out. When the
face plate of his helmet was removed
he asked for the glass of whisky he
was accustomed to receive and which
he had never been refused because it
has become an unwritten law that a
glass of grog Is to be served to divers
when they have been at work. The
doctor . of the ship, who did not be
lieve, in unwritten laws and believed
in running his department oh the ship
according to the . written code, re
fused Reardon's request. The diver
admitted that he did not, need it, but
said he had always received it and
wanted it as usual. When the doctor
persisted Reardon demanded that his
suit be taken off.
At 1 o'clock when Admiral Dewey
noticed that the wrecking operations
had ceased, he sent for the executive
officer, the captain and the gunner to
learn what was the trouble. He waa
told and then he sent for, Reardon.
/'"How about this, Reardon?" he
said, when the bluejacket appeared.
"I am surprised that you give up."
"I, am not giving up, sir," said Rear
don, "it's the doctor. I want a glass
of whisky because I am in the habit
of getting & and he refuses to give
It to me because it is against the rules
of the service."
Deivey and the Diver.
THERE is not much variety to' business at present
The markets of the' country are generally, in .a
'normal condition,. more so than for some months,
and whether we look at agriculture or finance or mer
chandising we find the same monotonous ' conditions!
Speculation in coffee, -cotton and wheat has subsided'dur
ing the past month, and even Wall street exhibits little
feature.
The general situation, however, is favorable. \The ad
vent of spring has enlivened the retail distribution of
goods in the cities and started' up farming operations,
which lends an air 'of increasing activity to. the nation.
As far as this is concerned, we are still doing a large
business. The bank clearings of the country again- ex
ceeded the index number of two billion last week",
amounting in the aggregate to $2,001,977,000, 'and the
shrinkage from 1903 was only 8.7 per cent, with the
gains and losses about equally distributed among the
largest cities. A pronounced falling off in the clearings
at New Orleans indicates the subsidence of the furious
cotton speculation. in^that city for several months, and
shrinkages of 14.7 per cent at New York and 23.6 per
cent at Pittsburg show ho"w operations in general trade
and finance at the former and in iron and steel at the
latter point are standing in comparison with the corre
sponding week in 1003. Chicago, where the grain and
provision trades center, is. 9.7 per cent better than last
year. The failures for the week were 235, against 317
last year.
The staples are in a humdrum condition at the moment,
but they exhibit one particular feature which must not
escape attention. The record for March shows a very
significant trend in prices, as eight out of thirteen classes
of products, including brea'dstuffs, meats, textiles,- hides
and leather and building material, declined. The gen
eral level of prices fell off about 10 per cent for the
month, but is still in excess of a year ago at this time,
and not far from the highest for years past. In fact, as
frequently mentioned during the past six of 'eight months,
the general tendency in quotations for everything in the
country is toward a lower plane of values. This points
to a decreasing cost of living, but it also indicates a
corresponding decrease in the gross returns, to the pro
ducer, whether farmer or manufacturer. The exhibit,
taken as a whole, sufficiently proves that for some time
past there has been and is now a slow but sure recession
from the boom conditions of several years ago. It is
unattended by excitement, is without strain and is prob
ably a good thing for the country. It is certainly to be
preferred to a sudden and violent break, which condition
we characterize by the sinister word, panic. These
gradual recessions give everybody ample warning and
plenty of time to put their business fences in repair.
Supplementary to the price, exhibit for March is the com
mercial record for the first quarter of the year, which
showed a general decrease in the volume of trade, as
compared with, the corresponding quarter in 1903. â
The financial conditions continue excellent. Money is
in abundance all over the country arid likely to continue
so. A significant feature in this connection is that re
cent engagements for gold' to" be shipped to Paris at
tracted no attention and were offset by liberal receipts
of gold from Japan at San Francisco. Indeed, it is quite
likely that the shipments to Paris were, nothing more
than the continued journey of the Japanese gold through
New York to Europe, where Japan has some large bills
for war material to pay, and in this view of the case
there were really no gold exports at all.
Bankers continue to point seductive fingers at Wall
street stocks and to assure the country* that everything
in that line is a safe thing for those who wish to buy.
They say that with stocks on a 5 per cent dividend
paying basis and money available at 2 per cent, there
is little danger of any one getting his fingers burned by
taking in a line or two of .judiciously selected standard
securities. But the public is not taking hold of the mar
ket freely and shows an inclination to wait a while
longer and see how the cat jumps. By and by they may
suddenly wake up and greedily go in for shares, in which
event Wall street will have another bull market. Even
as it is, the trend of quotations is upward and many
good stocks are considerably higher than a few weeks
ago.
The crop prospects of the country, on which so much
depends, are excellent. Fine weather all over the great
wheat belt is encouraging the sowing of spring wheat,
the growing plant looks green and flourishing/and'
though/ conditions are rather : the normal they
are better than they have been, some' authorities esti
mating the improvement since the first of the month as
high as 20 per cent. This condition is encouraging and
imparts, a feeling of confidence to the whole country.
The prospects on -this coast are highly satisfactory.
The crop outlook could .not be better, and as prices for
all farm products are excellent everybody .looks forward
to continued good times. Our city and interior banks are
stilH^berally supplied with funds, and few complaints/of
collections are hebrd, while failures are generally small
and not numerous. The export trade of the coast con
tinues large and the domestic; demand for all sorts of
goods 'is active. The state of trade in California could
not well be improved upon. .
The native parrot, the kea, which in
this district forgets to kill sheep for
their kidney fat. the comical wingless
weka and the bell bird are a few of
the songsters whose quaint notes are
frequently heard In the most inacces
sible of passes. But these are not the
only unique sounds to be heard on the
Tasman, for one of the favorite routes
takes the traveler in a cage across the
wild, rushing Hooker River; aval
anches of stones constantly rattle
against the glacier faces as they toss
to the great moraine beneath ami now
and again deafening claps as of thun
der dull the ears at the coming of some
great new crevasse in this ice field,
which, while so awe-inspiring, so pic
turesque in its unrivaled grandeur, is
yet easily* and safely accessible to the
most timid and inexperienced. Indeed,
no great sight in the world can be
seen for so slight an outlay of caFh
and energy as the enthralling Tasman
glacier in New Zealand.
The flora of this region Is most va
ried and beautiful. Edelweiss flourish
es luxuriantly three thousand feet
aboi-e sea level and there are nearly
fifty flowering plants not known to
exist in any other part of the world.
Bushes laden with berries, which in
autumn change their color, the moun
tain daisy and the alpine buttercup,
luxuriate amid a numerous bevy of
neighbors, all blossoming in purest
white, except the unique yellow ra
nunculus.
The alpine range of which the Tas
man glacier is -so fnterestingr a part
runs for a distance of a hundred miles
and as the line of perpetual snow^ia
at the flve thousand feet level or no
less than three thousand feet lower
than in Switzerland, the advantage to
the traveler in search of scenic mar
vels may easily be imagined. ' One of

-One statement of the opposition inconspicuously er
roneous. This is to the effect that an arbitration treaty
violates the advice of Washington's farewell address
against entangling alliances. An arbitration* treaty is not
a treaty of alliance. It is simply an international agree

The El Dorado County Board of

to co-operate for the benefit of the sec

stance as follows:
f A progressive body called the El Dorado
Board of Trade has recently been organized
In this county for the purpose of developing
this locality, advertising the resources of the
county, securing an increase in population and
assisting in the planting of new industries in
our midst.

INVITE CO-OPERATION
Negotiations are now Â¦ In progress to carry
out this object v and there is good prospect that
they will be successful. As many as 100 peo
ple have taken part at a time in these trips,
and the amount of good jione is incalculable.
Secretary . Stearns of . the Oakland Â¦ Board of
Trade is working hard In the matter, and to
his efforts, . if successful, Alameda will owe
not a little of the accomplishment. Of course.
It must not be lost- sight of, that it was
President Smith of the West End Association
who first took the matter up. Every Alamedan
who has. any possible- influence in this matter
should use it to the utmost.

It is proposed to change this route somewhat,
as soon Jts arrangement* can be made. The

change holds a meeting once a week.
Every member. and every citizen who

In a genera! way the purpose of the
exchange has been to get ' behind one
thing at a time and. to push that to a
finish. We have agitated In favor of
combining Oakland. --Alameda and
Berkeley into one city. That ought to
be effected. The consolidation of the
three cities Into one would make a
community larger- than Los Angeles.
It would be influential by reason of the
character of its inhabitants. The Mer
chants' Exchange- Is emphatically In
favor of a greater Oakland, , to extend
from the Contra Costa. County line -to
San Leandro Creek.* Now, within three
miles of the Oakland -City Hall, five

Recently the Merchants' Exchange
has been engaged in collecting the Al

iana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis.

Five successful celebrations of the
Fourth of July In Oakland have been
brought about by the Merchants' Ex
change. Each, in succession, has been
better than the preceding ones. This
has almost led us to dread the next
celebration for fear that It will not keep
up the record of being an improvement
on those that have gone before it. In
former years Oakland would have a
fine Fourth of July procession in the
forenoon. After that was over every
one would go out of the city.
The Merchants' Exchange has real
ized that there could be a practical as
well as a patriotic side to the Fourth
of July celebrations. In carrying out
this Idea, celebrations have been de
vised so that the visitors to the city
would remain all day. There have been
morning parades, afternoon exercise*
at Lake Merritt and -fire works in the
evening. This has resulted in leaving
quite a large sum of money from out
side in Oakland every Fourth of July.
Thousands of visitors have been
brought into the city and Induced to
pass the Fourth in Oakland.
The Merchants* Exchange has co-op
erated to bring people to Oakland dur
ing the sessions of the national assem
blies of various kinds in San Fran
cisco. Oakland days have become well
known. The fame of Oakland haa
been largely extended thereby. Oak
land entertained, among other famousj
guests. President McKlnley and Pres
ident Roosevelt. Arrangement* are
making now for the entertainment of
the delegate* to the National Retail
Grocers' convention to be held soon In
San Francisco.
The Merchants' Exchange- also put
through the Redwood Canyon and
Moraga Valley road, otherwise known
as the Medau road. The Exchange has
also co-operated with others in the new
foothill road from Oakland to Hay
wards. That follows the line of the
lower foothills and is distinctively a
scenic drive. One provision Is that
no electric or other railway shall be
constructed on the road. We co-oper
ated with other bodies In that. The
Merchants' Exchange haa assisted in
having Oakland's streets improved.
The work on Telegraph avenue ia now
under way and It will probably be
completed in six months.
FOURTH OF JULY.
The cost of constructing the road
was auite large. Three-fifths of the
tunnel is in Contra Costa County. It
was evident that Contra Costa County
could not undertake three-fifths of the
expense. It was therefore arranged
that Contra Costa should pay two
fifths, Alameda County two
fifths and the remaining -one-fifth of
the cost was to be raised through the
agency of the Merchants' Exchange by
subscriptions. This plan was carried
out successfully. The Merchants* Ex
change raised between $11,000 and $12,
000. The road does not reduce the dis
tance, but decreases the grade and
opens up an easy way for the people
of Contra Costa County to get into
Oakland to trade.
also, at the same time, increased the
roads leading into Oakland. The most
noteworthy of the enterprises of this
sort in which the Merchants' Exchange
has been engaged was the tunnel road
between Alameda and Contra Costa
counties. That road was projected
many years ago. Since then it has
been taken up as a dream at intervals.
About six years ago the Exchange went
at the matter in earnest and the re
sult is that the road has been com
pleted.

matter of importance has been brought
to the front by the "Alameda West End
Improvement Association. The story, is

follows: "' 'i /Â»â¢'>- f
"Within less than eighteen months
over 3000 settlers have made . their
homes in these districts, and oncÂ£ un
broken grain ranches of from (rtO to
10,000 acres in a body have been sub
divided and a score of families will
now often be found where formerly
there was but one. On one of the
largest tracts fully 100 families now
have homes, and on another in excess
of 1000 men, women and children, all
from the Middle West, have made
their habitation and are prospering.
Modesto'8 population has, in the in
terim jumped from 2000 to about 3000,
the settlement of Ceres has doubled in
population, and the little town of Tur
lock has trebled its people and business
houses.
"The cost of great enterprise
was $2,600,000, /representing a bonded
indebtedness of less than $10 per acre
on the land, of which only the Inter
est, at 5 per cent, is payable during the
next twenty years. Enhanced values
and business: already represent double
the investment. Â¦ , "** '.
"A great . concrete dam thirty miles

SETTLERS BY THOUSANDS.
Among the leading events now inter
esting the interior counties of Califor
nia is the coming jubilee at Modesto
on April 22 and 23, to commemorate the
completion and successful operation of
a great frrigation system. A circular
has been issued by the Jubilee Press
Committee from which some idea of
the importance of the event to be cel
ebrated to the people dwelling in and
about Modesto may be gained. The
circular asserts that, the jubilee "will
mark an epoch in the history of Cali
fornia," and continues:
"It will signalize the completion and
successful operation of the greatest ir
rigation system in America, one of the
greatest in the world, planned,' con
structed, owned and managed by ' the
owners of the 260,000 acres of land tra
versed by the canals â by the , people,
organized for the purpose in two mu
nicipal corporations known as t the
Modesto 'and J Turlock Irrigation dis
tricts. .Â¦- .',:,..
The Merchants' Exchange haÂ« ftriven
to have the people of Alameda County
trade in Oaklandor in Alameda Coun
ty. The basket brigade that used to
come into Alameda County every even
ing from San Francisco/has been made
much smaller than it tias. The same
1Â» true of the bundle array coming -to
Alameda County from San Francisco
at Christmas time. We say and are
prepared to demonstrate that pur
chasers of any kind of good* can buy
ag well in Oakland as they can in San
Francisco, both as regards quality and
prire.
While the Merchant*?" Exchange has
directly assisted the merchants, it nab
The only licenses now existing are for
the regulation of special lines. Reform
in the matter of the merchandise licen
ses was brought about by the creation
of public sentiment in the first instance.
It is no morf equitable to specially tax
the merchant than it is to tax, by li
cense, the dentist, lawyer or medical
practitioner. We contend against the
license for delivering goods.
The fact has been established by the
Merchants' Exchange that the mer
chants of Oakland can deliver in their
own wagons their own merchandise
without having to pay for a license to
pursue that right. Formerly the Oak
land merchants had to pay a license
for delivering in Oakland. Alameda and
Berkeley. We took the license matter
into court. We three times contested
the license for delivering goods in Ala
meda and three times for the right to
deliver in Berkeley and for the Oak
land right once. The last decision was
in favor of the Merchants' Exchange
and as all five Superior Judges sat in
bane to hear the case, that finally pet
tied the matter for good.
TRADING AT HOME.
One matter that has strongly en
gaged the attention of the Merchants'
Exchange is the prevention and lessen
ing of special licenses as against mer
chants doing business in Oakland. It
has been claimed by the Merchants'
Exchange that there is no- reason,
based on justice, why the merchants
should shoulder Â»- special tax or license
for doing business. The money that is
necessary for carrying on the city,
we have maintained, should be raised
by general taxation. There are no
merchandise licenses in existence now
in Oakland. At times such licenses
have ranged frem $2 to $100 per
quarter.
in all ways possible within the scope
<>f its purposes. Its first aim was to
* reate a better feeling among the mer
chants, so that they might all pull to
gether. Much has been accomplished
by reason of this. The successes of the
Merchants' Exchange are of several

WASHINGTON, April. 10. â April 23
has been discussed in committee-rooms

tives as not at all an improbable date
for the termination of the present ses
sion of Congress. No call has yet been
issued, but Republican leaders of the
Senate anticipate holding a meeting
of the steering committee early next
week to agree on a general programme
for the remaining days of the session.
The appropriation bills this week will
take precedence of all business in the
Senate.V but it is more man probable
that political discussion will take /up
most of the time nominally devoted to
appropriations. The postofflce bill will
divide attention early in the week with
the conference report on the Indian bill.
By the time these two measures shall
.have* been disposed of it is expected
that the sundry civil bill will have
been reported from the Committee on
Appropriations. It . is quite generally
understood that several Democratic
Senators will reply to Senator Spooner's
speech, among them Senator Gorman.
There will be an effort made to get up
the Panama canal bill during the week,
but not if it. would interfere with con
sideration of appropriation bills.
The measures of importance that will
come before the House this week in
clude the $3,000,000 appropriation to
carry on necessary river and harbor

is expected to come from. the. Appro

Consternation on the Peters.
The river steamer J. D. Peters started for
El- Campo yesterday morning wiyf a merry
party on board, full of mirth and frolic. The
joyousness of the occasion was nipped In' the
bud to some extent when the steering gear of
the boat went wrong, which caused the steamer
for a time to float here' and therÂ« at the
mercy ' of the fortunately ". calm j sea. Merri
ment gave way to wonderment, wonderment to
quiet and quiet to suspense, until relief finally
came In sight and the erstwhile" merrymakers
were finally landed alongside Paclflc-Etreet
wharf. Machinists were put to work to re
pair the damage and the picnic party, which
momentarily lost its gladness, again became
gay, and it is reported that the groves and
glens of El Campo, ere* night, resounded with
the Joyous laughter of lovely maidens . and
the boisterous glee of happy swains.
.Mongolia Is Overdue.
The non-arrival of the big steamship Mon
golia, now fully due from: Norfolk, Va., Is
commencing to cause comment In shipping
circles. She is out fifty-one days: It was the
Intention of the steamship, when she started
for this port, to put into Sallna Cruz to take
on board her Chinese crew, which has already
been landed there. No report of her calling
at that port has been forwarded from there.
Tha only notice of her that has reached here
was the report that on March 6 she had been
sighted oft, the Brazilian coast In' 25 W 10 S.
Of couran It Is possible that she may have
put into Sallna Cruz and that (by an oversight)
no mention of the fact was forwarded.

Movement of Steamers.
A large number of the big fleet of
steam schooners which have been tied
up here for the past three weeks, owing
to the strike, sailed out over the bar
yesterday. They are all in ballast,
bound to different northern ports to
load lumber. '-'All have cargoes await
ing them. They made a pretty picture
as they passed out through the Golden
Gate In the glimmering sunlight of trio
bright summer's â¢ afternoon. The fol
lowing vessels were in the fleet: Santa
Barbara, W. H. Kruger, Pomo, Santa
Monica, Chehalls, San Pedro, Noyo,
North Fork, Marshfleld, Brunswick
.and Westport. Their captaips, engi
neers and crews were all glad the tie
up was over and that they could go
back again to their peaceful vocations
afteV days of argument and strife.
Added to this largre number of light
lumber: craft that sailed out were the
ships Santa Clara, Indiana and bohe
mia, bound for Bristol Bay, and the
brig J. D. Spreckles and the schooner
Pearl, bound north for the cod fishing
stations.

Masters of all coasting: vessels' arriving in
port during the last three days report that the
ocean, both north and south of this port,. is aa
still' and as ciuiet as a lake. They are unani
mous in statins^ that they have never known
the briny to be so absolutely quiet. Whether
It is a counteraction of the recent furious
gales that have sws.it the tpast, or is the
"lull before the storm" is a question that re

TO VIEW THE INTERMEN1
Spanish Court Will Not Attend the
Last Rites Over the Former
Queen.
MADRID, April 10.â The Official Mes
senger, which appears to-day with
black borders, merely announces tha
death of former Queen Isabella and
makes no statement regarding the
funeral arrangements.
King Alfonso desires that every hon
or should be paid to the dead, but the
body will not be met at the frontier by
the members of the Cabinet. Minister
of Justice Toca alone will go to El
Escorial, which is twenty-six mile3
northwest of Madrid, for the interment.
Requiem masses will be said simul
taneously at Madrid and Barcelona on
April 12. The Spanish court will go
into mourning for one year.
PARIS, April 10. â The remains of ex-
Queen Isabella, clad in the habit of the
Sisterhood of St.' Francis, were this
morning placed on a catafalque in the
great drawing-room of the Palace Cas
tillo, the late Queen's residence, which
had been converted into a chapelle ar
dente. Only diplomats, French Gov
ernment officials and Spanish notabil
ities were admitted to the palace in th<?
morning. The public was admitted in
the afternoon.
STOCKS IX LONDON
,~%: MARKET IMPROVING
Anglo-French Treaty and Good Labor
Conditions in Africa Cause
Revival.
LONDON, April 10.â The improved
condition of business on the Stock Ex
change continued last week, the lead
being taken^ in American and South
African securities. The latter revived
under the influence of the near pros
pect' of a supply of Asiatic labor. The
conclusion of the Anglo-French colon
ial treaty was another factor which
made for a revival of confidence, it be
ing regarded as further insuring th?
localization of the Russo-Japanese con
flict. The situation in the Balkan
states also 5 displayed a more peaceful
aspect, and taking all these things to
gether the prospect is bright for an end
to the long-standing stagnation.
Almost all the markets participated
in the steady advance in prices, al
though Americans fluctuated consid
erably.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 10.â The
Associated Press has received special
reports from all the Jewish districts of
Russia regarding the happenings * of
Easter Sunday. Up to 2 o'clock this
morning, according to these dispatches,
the Russian Easter passed quietly and
there was absolutely no attempt to
molest the Jews, the provincial Gov
ernors acting: in accordance with in
structions from St. Petersburg. The
faithful execution of the Governor's
orders to the local authorities and the
police prevented the outbreaks which
were feared at Kishenev. the scene of
the disturbances last Easter. There
was not a single case there in which
Jews and Christians were involved.
The Government officials here are
gratified that order has been so gen
erally preserved. The following dis
patches have been received by the As
sociated Press:
Odessa â The day passed off quietly.
There was no attempt at a disturbance
and none was expected. The reports
circulated .of an outbreak at Odessa
are false. , . '
Klshenevâ This city has been entirely
tranquil to-day.
VilnaâIt is reported that two Jews 1
assaulted a local watchman yesterday,
cutting him with knives. Perfect or
der prevails to-day.
Baltarâ This city was tranquil to
day.
Grodnaâ No attempts were made to
day to disturb the peace.
Vitebsk â There was no disorder of
any kind here during the Easter cele
bration.
Minskâ As usual 1 at Easter there was
some rowdyism here to-day, but It did
not lead to any serious disturbances.

i The afternoon game might not have
been a bona fide exhibition of the peer
less ! national, pastime; -but it was a
hoadliner for excitement and -a â¢ peach
for', the umpire. ,: Every.- one j iri. ; the ' lot
swore that McCarthy made , arrange
ments with Lohman whereby he might
have the game for his own! -At*- all
events," two bad decisions turned the
trick and allowed Peter to gallop away
at the finish.. V : , '
The first overlook on the part^of the
umpire came to. pass irt round one. It
was then the Oaklanders" commenced
to hit some and the 'webfooters
began to play some bad baseball and
the umpire commenced by making, a
bad decision. Ganley . opened M^v up
with'a sizzler to the left for two bases."
Francks hit over short and Ganley
halted at bag three. Kruger popped
up a" delicious pop fly to Mr. . Castro,
and the. $1220 kid let it glide through
his. mitts ever so. softly*,"
* UMPIRE IS MOBBED.
Ganley made a dash for the plate
and Castro recovered the ball and
whipped it home nicely. Shea got it
five" feet from the rubber and surely
tagged Ganley. But McCarthy^ said
"nixey," and oh, such a holler! You
could hear those youths and those men
and those women yell and rage eleven
blocks away. The Portlanders gathered
around the umpire and it looked like
him for a wallop" in the jaw, but peace
wag finally the order and the fun com
menced once more. Francks and Kru
ger pulled off a double .. steal, and
Francks landed at the rubber .when
Freeman allqjved Schafly's pop fly" to
drop unmolested in back of first. â¢
Solitude reigned till the second, when
Oakland came through with. two more.
Schmidt solved,wne,andisent^lt" out to
center /on the 'run. "Ganley ; was hit
by the pitcher and Francks : responded
with a three-cushion clout to the flag
pole that ' chased both runners . all the
way around. â¢- y'. , > ' Â¦-
. Portland was not all In.: The' husky
swingers gave Mr^Schmidt a reception
in that third inning that -savored of
the real dope. Shea commenced the
fun by beating out a bunt. Shields
tore off a double over first, and 'when
Nadeau; placed a hot single to center
and scored both men 'it was great to
hear the multitude" yell. Nor did. it
stop there, for Castro tripled and Beck
doubled .right away.and . the score - was
a tie before any one know what was
doing. , â¢ *
ANOTHER BAD-DECISIOX.
In the next inning Mr. McCarthy
double-crossed the tail-enders once
again. Schmidt tapped for two bases
and Ganley hit one to Francis. The
latter fielded the ball well and threw
to first. The runner looked out by a
block, but McCarthy decided in favor
of the plaintiff, and then the roar was
once more raised and this time with
a true: vengeance.
It was awful to see the crowd and
the players go to that umpire. / Any
one could have pitied him.\ But he had
made his decision, and .: that was all.
Frahck's long fly to right field allowed
Schmidt to register, and IKruger's
beautiful triple' to center put Ganley
over the Jumps with the last tally, of
the day for Oakland.
It looked like another big rally, for
Portland in the sixth," but the northern
stars quit after making a run with the
aid of Freeman's single over third "and
Shea's hair-raising two-bagger out
past Dunleavy.
Portland should really have lost the
game on account- of the â¢â¢ awful work
that was performed In the field. -Pop
flies went for hits right along and all
kinds of dummy plays were pulled off.
Both pitchers, got their wallopings In
every inning, but if McCarthy had'de
cided both the close : plays in Port
land's favor, j Oakland would certainly^
have been beaten to the finish. The
score: / .

The reserve stake was won by the
old-time champion Sacramento Boy.
He was led to the hare each time, but
once on the game he hammered out
points in rapid "succession. The up
country dog beat in turn Racing Auto,
Rose of Gold. Pasha Pleasant, Rich
ard Anton and, in the deciding course.
Tralee Lass. This was the best trinl
of the day and was remarkable for
the rapidity with which each grey
hound scored points. The score was
1.5 to 9. The day's results, with Judge
P. J. Reilly's official scores, follow:
It required five- courses at Union
Coursing Park yesterday to decide the
first of the series of trials in the Grand
National championship stakes. No
more evenly matched greyhounds than
Pocatelli and Rector ever went into
the hands of a slipper as the running
proved.
Rector led by two lengths in the
first two trials, losing the firPt and
winning the second. Pocatelli won
the third trial, leading to the hare
by one length. In the fourth and fifth
trials the great greyhounds ran to the
hare as if coupled. The score was
a tie in the fourth and then Pocatelli
went on and won the course and the
scries. ~*

Lily York took final honors in the
open stake at Ingieside Park yesterday,
beating P. J.. Reilly's Clover Blossom
in the deciding- course by'a score of 6
to 5. Tn nearly all of her | trials Lily
won by a scant- margin, but by^her
cleverness she managed to
her opponents; Vciqver Blossom led her
in the final' and took 1 the turn, but Lily
outworked her and came in for the kill,
which gave her the flag and the stake.
A change has been made in the slips
at Ingieside that gives the spectators
a better view of the courses, and as" -a
rule sends the hare in a straight line to
the escapes.

Mr. Smith's text was: "If It seems
evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose
you this day who. you. -will serve." The
speaker pointed out most feelingly how
essential and beneficial, it is for men to
live Christian lives, and so impressive
were his remarks that at. the close of
the sermon' forty members of the
church asked. that, they might join the
Evangelistic Union.
Mr. Smith will hold services in the
Trinity Episcopal Church every after
noon at 3 o'clock and at Grace M. E.
Church every evening.

intended for the* Jailers into Sultner's
face. Then Sultner and Giovanni took
refuge In the corners, yelling like
Indians, and left Sterling to .fight it
out with, the stream from the fire hose.
The muscular footpad fought like a
tiger, trying to break the nozzle of the
hose with his piece of lead pipe and to
turn It aside so that the stream would
not strike him. The cell doors at the
Broadway Jail are of solid iron
and fit so closely, as to be almost water
tight. 'It was but a few minutes,
therefore, before Sterling found him
self standing almost waist-deep In cold
water, while the heavy stream,, deflect
ed from the walls of the narrow room,
seemed to fill every inch of, space with'
a mixture of water and plaster. It was
probably the most: thorough if. not the
cleanest bath' the desperado ever had.
When Policeman Merchant finally
swung the cell door open, a flood of
water rushed forth that ', covered the
whole floor t of - the jail. The prisoner
was then in a thoroughly submissive
mood, and said, "Don't you hit me.
I'll come out." ' Andout he came. The
officers at once put him on his back
and did him up in a strait-
Jacket and leg-irons; Sterling was. then
driven away* to the ferry, where -the
deputies insisted that he be kept in
the patrol wagon until the other side
was . reached. ; ' Hence Policeman Doug
las, who had by - this time taken . Mer
chant's place, .got: a ride over to the
Oakland pier,. where the prisoner was
transferred; to the- train and started
safely on -his journey to- Folsom. i

In the, pocket of a vest belonging: to

the landlord and written in pencil on
half a sheet of letter paper as follows:
"To the people of - the house â Please
excuse me for doing this, but I am
drove to it by bad luck and the .devil,
and a woman is the devil." He had ap
parenlly signed it, but had torn off the
part containing the signature. The
handwriting was the same as on the
address on 1 the package. â¢
A man who is supposed to have been
Gus M. Crowiey committed suicide â¢ in
his room, 1104^ Mission street; yesterday
morning, by blowing his head off with
a double-barreled . shotgun. ; He had
taken his seat on a chair, placed a loop
round each of the triggers and tied the
cord' to his right big toe. | Then,' placing
both muzzles against" his . chin, he drew
the cord tight with his toe arid both
charges were exploded, -blowing his
head off. , ' .
R." J. Toomey, the landlord, heard the
loud report, and while he .was hasten
ing to the room occupied by Crowiey
he met Charles Lane, one of the room
ers, who had also heard the report, and
told Toomey he had seen smoke pour
ing out of Crowley's open window.
Toomey notified. Policeman Tyrrell,
who forced open the door of Crowley's
room and his eyes met the fearsome
sight.; .. *,Â¦:.;'
A The Morgue was informed of the case
and Deputy, Coroner Brown - went for
the body. Detective Coleman was also
detailed on the case. The landlord in
formed them that Crowiey rented the
room on April 2 and had the shotgun
with him at that time. He appeared
to be a laboring man about 35 years of
age, and had evidently, been a heavy
drinker. He did -not give his name,
but a package containing writing paper
had the name "Gus M. Crowiey" writ
ten on the cover.
Sterling's cellmates were C. C. Sult
ner and V. Giovanni. As soon as the
terrible stream of cold water began to
make things lively inside the cell, they
begged to be let out, but Sterling re
fused to Â¦ permit the cell door to be
opened. These differences led to a fight
inside the cell, which culminated in
Sterling throwing the boiling water
SCALDS A CELLMATE.
j Naturally the jailers hesitated. There
were four jail officials- :; -Captain Sol
omon. Charles Dugan, Charles Feehan
and Mike Lynch-r-but none of them
desired to grapple . with Sterling,
his - alleged razor and .his
other less disputable armament.! They
called In Policemen . Cavanaugh and
Nelson from their beats near by, 'and
as Merchant came up -just then with
the patrol wagon he made the seventh
limb of the law on the ground.
Â¦It was finally decided to try the same
means that had Â¦ proved effective at
San Bernardino. "A' two-inch hose was
turned into the little grating of Ster
ling's cell and the^l water was turned
on. In an instant' there was "some
thing doing" inside. - â¢
, Sullivan accordingly took extra pre
cautions, in planning for. Sterling's re
moval. Instead of using the ordinary
jail wagon, he called on the police de
partment for assistance and the patrol
wagon was sent up from headquarters
in charge of Policeman Merchant soon
after 6 o'clock . yesterday morning.
When Sterling was ordered to come
out* of- his cell, he refused and chal
lenged any of the jailers* to .come in
after him. He brandished a frying
pan, which he and his two cellmates
had been permitted to. have in their
cell, where they did some cooking. On
the oil stove; he also had a can fun of
boiling water, with which he promised
to scald any officer bold enough. to en
ter the celL But his most formidable
weapon was a two-f bot piece of lead
pipe which he had broken off the closet
in his cell. Besides. these visible means
of defense he' claimed to have a razor
in his pocket and Invited any of the
Jailers, who wanted his throat cut to
come on. .: -
On Saturday* night Chief Jailer J. E.
Sullivan told Sterling to prepare for his
trip to Folsom the next morning: "Not
on your life, old man," the convicted
highwayman responded. "I am well
enough satisfied to stay here, and the
man who tries to get me out of this
cell will be sorry for it." Â¦;>"Â¦-'
Â¦ This .notorious desperado, who Is
deemed by the police one of Â¦ the
mMst dangerous In the ; State, Â»vai
convicted of robbing George Evans
in his restaurant, 318% Third
strict, on the â¢ night of No
vember 17. . His capture; ; after that
crime had been committed, was a work
of difficulty and came near costing De
tective O'Dea his life. Sterling was
found - by O'Dea in a Mission-street
lodging house. When the detective
called on him to surrender, _ the thuj;
drew a revolver and tried to- shoot
O'Dea, but ; the eun missed fire; and
Sterling was lioored by the officer strik
ing him on the head with a pair of
handcuffs. Still the desperate crook
managed to, set away before the
handcuffs could be fastened upon his
wrists.
Several weeks later'Sterling was ar
rested in, the South and locked up in
the San Bernardino County Jail. â¢ Here
he scalded a newspaper reporter with
boiling coffee when the latter tried to
Interview him, and when the San Fran
cisco officers came after him he; refused
to surrended until they had \' played
water from a hose on him for several
hours. Sir Sterling was not a stranger
yesterday to the effects of agua pura
as a means of discipline.
STERLING'S TH KEATS. .
The virtues of cold water as a pro
moter'of good cell manners were thor
oughly tested. yesterday morning at the
County Jail in the case of-' George
Sterling who was sentenced on Satur
day by Judge Dunne to, twenty-five
years, in. Folsom priscm. "It required
seven men and a two-inch ; stream' of
water from a fire hose. tv Induce Ster
ling to leave his cell for his trip up the
road, and he surrendered only after he
bad badly scalded one of his cellmates
and when his cell was nearly full of
water. â¢

The four Mortons tripped out on the
Orpheum stage last night after an ab
sence of several months.. It could
easily be seen that they had been
missed by the crowd, for as soon" as
Sam and Kitty appeared they , were
greeted with a volume of cheers. Their
act is about the same as they present
ed on their last visit to thla city, and
that Is saying much for it. They pre
sented It as they alone can do. -.
Sam and Kitty did their old stunt of
monologue and their comical sayings
and expressions were as good as ever.
Clara sang and danced as vivaciously
as of yore and â¢ got several encores
for her pains. Paul did a dude act
that was well worth the price and the
four, ended up with a rollicking Cock
ney song.
Edmund Day, Elmer E. Potter and
Patrice Winstan have a very touching
little sketch entitled "Shipmates." It
Is one of the best that Day has yet
produced and is modeled on original
lines. The acting-of the trio was very
clever and the Way Day and Potter
portrayed the quarrels of two old suits
was good to look upon.
Flo Adler jumped into Â¦ immediate
prominence with a couple of popular
selections. She sang very well and her
ballads seemed to be quite the thing
for Orpheum audiences. Her last
song, "Why Don't You Go?" made
such a hit that she was forced to re
peat it several times. The Ellis-Now
lan 'trio of comedy acrobats made
good. All the holdovers, including
Blind Tom, the pianist, the four Wil
sons. James Cullen and Omar and
Margina, all had something new to
present.
