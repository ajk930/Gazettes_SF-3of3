ST. PETERSBURG STRIKE RIOTS CULMINATE IN A BUTCHERY
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23, 8 a. m.âConservative estimates of the casualties in yesterday's strike riots place the number at about
500 killed or wounded. Some reports put the figures as high as 5000, but these are wild exaggerations. It is expected that the outbreak
will be resumed to-day, although upon a smaller scale. The night passed quietly, but throughout the city the workingmen were arming.
CZAR'S GOVERNMENT FACES REVOLUTION
SOLDIERS SHOOT DOWN SCORES OF MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23, 4:45 a. m.âSt. Petersburg
is sleeping quietly at this hour, worn out by the excitement of a
long day. Laborers and spectators have long since left the streets
and the military and police have had little to do tor hours be
yond driving off riotous bands of irresponsible voting roughs,
bent on marauding, and dispersing groups of too demonstrative
Socialists or Liberals returning from protracted meetings where
their minds were fired by incendiary speeches.
Since midnight the Russian capital has been as peaceful as it
was the preceding night, but in the palace square and in all the
principal streets and open places throughout the town bivouac
fires are gleaming and infantrymen are sleeping near their
stacked rifles or marching hither and thither. Cavalrymen on
wearied horses are patrolling the squares. No further firing has
been heard and no more reports of collisions have been received.
A renewal of rioting is not expected until late in the morn
ing, if at ali to-day, for the strikers are thoroughly wearied by
yesterday's events and will be to wait until the military
precautions have somewhat relaxed.
It is impossible even now to estimate at all closely the casu
alties of the day. The exact number of deaths probably never will
be known.
Afo Looting t>uring the Night.
With darkness last night it was feared the mob would begin
to loot and pillage and even burn, but beyond the breaking of a
few windows in the Nevsky Prospect and the pillaging of fruit
shops, little disorder was reported.
By midnight the sound of firing had ceased, except on Vas
. silliostrov Island, where the troops met a renewed demonstration
with several volleys. In the meantime the strike leaders assem
' bled and decided to continue the struggle with arms. No day was
fixed for the next demonstration.
At a big meeting last night the following message from
. Gorky, the novelist, was read:
"Beloved associates: We have no Emperor. Innocent blood
lies between him and the people. Now begins the people's strug
gle for freedom. May it prosper! My blessing upon you all.
Would that I might be with you to-night, but I have too much to
. â¢ do."
A workman who was introduced to speak in Father Go
pon's name made a fiery speech. He appealed to Liberals to
. furnish arms. The meeting adopted a letter denouncing the of
. ficers and regiments that fired on the workmen and another let
ter extolling the Moscow regiment, which refused to fire.
During the evening there were more foot passengers on
: the streets than might have been expected, but nothing like the
gayety and bustle of an ordinary Sunday evening. Comment on
the action of the troops and authorities was very bitter, and sar
castic remarks were made that officers were braver against the

Revolt of Circassians.
VICTORIA, B. C. Jan. 22.âCaptain Orlan Cnllen. represen
tative of the Imperial Marine Association of Tokio, received a
cablegram from Constantinople to-night to the effect thai 1500
Circassians had revolted and killed the Russian guard, number
ing 200, at Slavinia, in the Caucasus, and that Russians and Turks
in large numbers were crossing the frontier into the Caucasus to
spread revolution in Tiflis province. Tiflis City is practically in a
state of siege, he says, and communication is had only by dis
patch bearers.
Captain Cullen said late to-night that he had received further
reports from Constantinople, stating that large numbers of refu
gees, mostly Jews, were rushing i.ito Turkish territory, and that
the Sultan had placed the barracks of the imperial guards at Con
stantinople at the disposal of the refugees. Sir Nicholas O'Con
nor, British Minister, and American Minister Leishmann had
been appointed a committee to look after the wants of the refu
gees. The Armenian Hunchfgist Society in Constantinople has
issued 2 proclamation calling upon all Armenians to assist the rev
olutionists, and numbers of Aimenians continue to cross the
frontier to assist the Kurds, Armenians and Circassians beleag
uering Tiflis.
Czar's Life Is at Stake.*
PARIS, Jan. 22. â"The strikes in St. Petersburg and else
where, significant signs of the times, are controlled by Socialist
committees," said to the New York World correspondent to
day SemenofT, a Russian Hebrew, formerly correspondent for
Novoski, and now leading writer for an international political
review on European events.
"The Czar must see the handwriting on the wall. If he does
not grant a constitution, he will endanger the dynasty. Even
Liberals and Socialists are demanding a constitution, showing a
disposition to accept a Czar if equal rights be accorded. But if
they be refused the movement will become revolutionary and
republican, especially if the Czar listen to the counsels of the
Procurator of the Holy Synod and the Grand Duke Sergius.
â¢ "The Czar will make a mistake if he thinks of such conces
. sions as putting a stop to the flogging of peasants for non-pay
ment of taxes will be accepted in place of a constitution. There
is a universal demand for freedom of the press, the right of
public meetings, university gatherings, popular control of the
finances of the country and equal rights for Jews, Armenians
and Poles." .
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1905.
WINTER PALACE SQUARE WHERE RUSSIAN TROOPS FIRED UPON THE MOB OF STRIKERS.
MOB FIGHTS
BEHIND WEAK
BARRICADES
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 23, 2:30 a.
m.âA press correspondent was present
when the first barricades were con
structed on Vassiliostrov Island, where
fighting occurred late yesterday, re
sulting in the killing of thirty of the
defenders of the barricades. The strik
ers, driven from the river front, had
gathered in front of the union head
quarters, out of sight of the soldiers.
Buzzing like a nest of angry hornets,
a hundred men brandished handleless
saber blades secured from some Junk
shop, which were the only weapons
seen in the hands of the strikers during
the day. Others swarmed up poles and
cut down the telegraph, telephone and
electric light wires, which they strung
from lamp post to lamp post across the
street to break up charges of cavalry.
In the twinkling of an eye a sub
stantial barricade had been construct
ed, bound together with wires and
ropes. On these water was poured,
which immediately froze. As a last
contribution Christmas trees were add
ed to the pile and the crowd rushed
to repeat the process at the other end
of the block.
Meanwhile others were bringing on
brick and breaking them for missiles.
When the troops advanced the strikers
lined the barriers and offered what re
sistance they could, but while half of
the infantry rested their rifles on the
barricade and volleyed, the others de
molished the obstruction and marched
over the street, which was then en
cumbered with flifty dead or wounded
lying on the snow crimsoned with hu
man blood.
BLOOD FLOWS IN
STREETS OF
CAPITAL
Frenzied Populace Battles
With Imperial Troops.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 22.âThis has been a day of unspeakable
horror in St. Petersburg. The strikers of yesterday, goaded to despera
tion by a day of violence, fury and bloodshed, are In a state of open in
surrection against the Government. A condition almost bordering on civil
war exists in the terror-stricken Russian capital. The city is under mar
tial law, with Prince Vasilchikoff as commander of over 60,000 of the
Emperor's crack guards. Troops are bivouacking in the street to-night and
at various places on the Nevsky Prospect, the main thoroughfare of the
city. On the Island of Vassiliostrov and in the outer sections, infuriated
men have thrown up barricades, which they are holding. The Empress
Dowager has hastily sought safety at Tsarskoe-Selo, where Emperor
Nicholas II is living.
Minister of the Interior Sviatopolk-Mirsky presented to his Majesty
last night the invitation of the workmen to appear at the Winter Palace
this afternoon and receive their petition, but the Emperor's advisers al
ready had taken a decision to show a Arm and resolute front and the
Emperor's answer to 100,000 workmen trying to make their way to the
Palace Square to-day was a solid army of troops, which met them with
rifle, bayonet and saber.
The priest, Gopon, the leader and idol of the men, in his golden vest
ments, holding aloft the cross and marching at the head of thousands of
workmen through the Narva gate, miraculously escaped a volley which
laid low a half-hundred persons.
The figures of the total number killed or wounded here, at the Mos
cow gate, at various bridges and islands and at the Winter Palace, vary.
The best estimate is 500, although there are exaggerated figures placing
the number as high as 5000.
Many men were accompanied by their wives and children and in the
confusion, which left no time for discrimination, the latter shared the fate
of the men. The troops, with the exception of a single regiment, which
is reported to have thrown down its arms, remained loyal and obeyed or
ders. Cut the blood which crimsoned the snow has fired the brains and
passlonfljgat the strikers and turned women as well as men into wild
beastSv'Wttd the cry of the infuriated populace is for vengeance.
The symoathy of the middle classes is with the workmen.
PRIEST BREAKS PEOPLE'S FAITH IN CZAR.
If Father Gopon, the master mind of the movement, aimed at open
revolution, he managed the affair like a genius to break the faith of the
people in the "Little Father," who they were convinced and whom Father
Gopon had taught them to believe, would right their wrongs and redress
their grievances. (
Gorky, the Russian novelist, expresses the opinion that to-day s work
will break this faith of the people in the Emperor. He said this evening:
"To-day inaugurated revolution in Russia. The Emperor's prestige will

various parts of Germany are large
. numbers of cannon intended to be
rushed into Russia and used by the
revolutionists in their struggle with
the Russian dynasty as soon as the
signal shall be given.
Secret plans were perfected at a con
. gress of Russian revolutionist leaders
in Switzerland in December, by which
. Poles, Finns, Armenians and others
engaged in the rising should strike to
gether at the same signal.
This information was given to Dr.
Leon N. Cartman of this city, a promi
nent member of the Russian revolu
tionary* aid society, by Katrina Bres
kovskay, who is high in the inner
councils of the revolutionary party
and who was in attendance upon the
congress upon the occasion of her visit
in this city a short time ago.
Although Dr. Cartman says Mrs.
Breskovskay refused to tell him the
time fixed for the war signal, it is
generally believed among the revolu
tionist's here that the present rising
in St. Petersburg will be the occasion
\ for the unleashing of these hidden
forces, and that it has been begun
according to carefully matured plans
which will array against the Russian
dynasty hundreds of thousands of
subjects of the Czar.
The almost unanimously expressed
opinion of local traders of the Russian
colony in regard to the present rising
in St. Petersburg is that, after more
. than forty years of striving and suffer
ing, the supreme moment has come In
.the cause of Russian liberty. Social
ists, revolutionists and anarchists all
profess confidence that the ultimate re
sult will be the complete overthrow of
the- present form of government in
. Russia and the emancipation of the
masses. The rising they declare is the
first of a series which will be spread
, from St. Petersburg to the provinces
until the whole empire Is involved.
REBUFFED BY PRINCE MIRSKY
Vain Attempt by Journalists to Avert
Shedding of Blood.
' ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 22.âTwo
â hundred journalists and professional
men met in this city on Saturday even
ing to discuss means to avoid blood
shed. A committee consisting of the
authors Kharsenieff, Gorky, Annensky
and Gessen, several professors and the
workmen's advocate, Kedrim, was ap
pointed to interview Minister of the
Interior Sviatopolk-Mirsky. They ar
rived at the Ministry of the Interior at
10 o'clock last night, but were received
coldly, the officials there declaring that'
It was impossible for them to see the
Minister that night. The committee
men announcing their intention to wait
until the Minister would see them they
were persuaded to see Assistant Min
ister Rydoftsky, who resolutely refused
to call Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky and
ironically told them they would better
persuade the workmen to abandon their
plans of a procession to the palace.
Thus rebuffed, the committeemen
proceeded to Wltte's residence. Witte
received them affably and offered them
tea, which they declined. Having
heard them, Witte expressed himself
with great sympathy, but maintained
that all measures had been decided
without consulting him, adding:
"I am nothing in the administra
tion."
Witte then referred them to Minister
Sviatopolk-Mirsky, regretting his In
ability to do anything and advising
them to have the demonstration aban
doned. He said the workmen had
taken a wrong course, which was in
compatible with autocracy. The Em
peror could only receive a deputation
by appealing through the proper chan
nels. He then telephoned to Minister
Sviatopolk-Mirsky and tried to per
suade him to receive the committee.
The Minister, however, still declined!
and the deputation departed.
Late to-night, at a conference of edi
tors of St. Petersburg newspapers, it
was agreed to address to the censors a
protest against the censorship of the
day's events, and it was also resolved
to send a deputation to negotiate with
the workmen's union regarding the re
sumption of work by the printers.

be irrevocably shattered by the shedding of innocent blood. He has
alienated himself forever from his pecple. Gopon taught the workmen
to believe that an appeal direct to the 'Little Father' would be heeded.
They have been undeceived. Gopon is now convinced that peaceful
means have failed and that the only remedy is force. The'first blooc'shas
been shed, but more will follow. It is now the people against the oppres
sors and the battle will be fought to the bitter end.
The military authorities had a firm grip on every artery in the city.
At daybreak guards, regiments, cavalry and infantry, held every bridge
across the frozen Neva, the network of canals which interlaces the city
and the gates leading from the industrial section, while in the palace
square, at the storm center, were massed dragoon regiments, infantry and
Cossacks of the guards. Barred from the bridges and gates, men,
women and children crossed the frozen river and canals on the ice by
twos and threes, hurrying to the palace square, where they were sure
the Emperor would be present to hear them.
But the street approaches to the square were cleared by volleys and
Cossack charges. Men and women, infuriated to frenzy by the loss of loved
ones, cursed the soldiers while they retreated. Men harangued the
crowd, telling them that the Emperor had foiled them and that they had
come to act. Men began to build barricades In the Nevsky Prospect and
at other points, using any material that came to hand and even chop
ping down telegraph poles.
SOLDIERS VOLLEY AND CHARGE THE MOBS.
Fighting meantime continued at various places, soldiers volleying and
charging the mobs. The whole city was in a state of panic. Women
were running through the streets, seeking lost members of their families.
Several barricades were carried by tho troops.
Toward 8 o'clock in the evening, the crowds, exhausted, began to dis
perse, leaving the military in possession. As they retreated up the Nevsky
Prospect the workmen put out all the lights. The little chapel at the
Narva gate was wrecked.
Every officer wearing the uniform of the Emperor who was found
alone was mobbed. A general was killed on the Nicholas bridge and
a dozen officers were seized, stripped of their epaulets and deprived of
their swords.
It is rumored to-night that Witt c will be appointed dictator to-morrow,
but the report is not confirmed. Th c authorities, while they seem to real
ize the magnitude of the crisis with which the dynasty and the autocracy
are confronted on account of to-day's events, apparently are paralyzed
"for the moment.
Intense indignation is certain to be aroused throughout Russia. The
workmen and revolutionists expect news from Moscow and other big cen
ters, where the troops are not nf the same class as the guards regiment of
St. Petersburg..
A member of the Emperor's household is quoted as having said to-day
that this conflict would end the war with Japan and that Russia would

ADMIRALTY GARDENS SCENE
OP AWFUL CARNAGE.
Three Volleys Fired at Mob
Â»
WOMEN PERISH WITH THE MEN
BEFORE GUNS OF THE SOLDIERY
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 22.âThe
most harrowing scenes of the day oc
curred around the Palace Square. This
enormous place back of the Winter
! Palace is surrounded by gardens front
j ing the Admiralty and by a vast semi
' circular building containing'the offices
of the General Staff, the Ministry of
Finance and the Foreign Office. In the
l center of the block is cut an arched
gateway surmounted by a bronze quad
riga. The gateway serves as an en
trance to the Grand Morskaia, one of
the most fashionable streets in the
city, which crosses the Nevsky Pros
pect. Beyond the semi-circular build
ing is a wide space leading to the
Moika Canal and beyond this stands an
enormous square building, the head
quarters of the St. Petersburg military
district. From thence Grand Duke
Vladimir had issued orders for the
whole military preparations directing
to-day's operations. In the center of the
square stands an enormous granite
column supporting a statue of Victory,
commemorating the defeat of the Na
poleonic invasiun. at which a veteran
guard of the uniform of the period of
Alexander 1 tetands sentinel.
When a press correspondent arrived
at the Palace Square early this morn
ing he found a crowd of demonstrators
already lining the railing of the Ad
miralty garden and the boulevard.
The square itself presented the appear
ance of a military encampment. Sev
eral companies of the Davlovsky and
Preobrajensky guards had stacked
their arms, while the men were sitting
around camp fires or stamping on thu
snow to keep warm.
GUARDS CARRY CARBINES.
- Beyond the infantry stood squadrons
of the Chevalier Guards and the Horse,
Guards, without their lanoes, cuirasses
or the usual gay trappings. The
men carried carbines slung across
their shoulders, and their stirrups
werÂ« covered with felt or straw,
to keep off the cold. All the
soldiers wore bashliÃas, or hoods,
to protect their ears from the keen,
searching wind. A field kitchen
steamed merrily, disseminating the
fragrant odor of viands. Many of the
men wrestled or boxed, craoklng jokes
as one rolled on the snow. A whole
row of ambulances drawn up near the
Palace served as a grim reminder of
the stern business on hand.
Meanwhile pickets were stationed at
all the entrances of the palace and a
cavalry patrol kept promenaders mov
ing along the sidewalks. Sleigh traffic
continued uninterrupted till the time
came for the cavalry to charge. The
crowd of strikers in and outside the
Admiralty Garden continued to grow
hourly, swelled by arrivals from the
Nevsky Prospect, which touches upon
the boulevard skirting and gardens.
The strikers manned and held a
small edifice at the corner of the gar
dens and poured out constant objur
gations and reproaches at the troops.
It was in vain that the officers re
quested them to disperse.
"We have come to present our hom
age and grievances.to the Emperor."
"Let the Emperor come out and
hear us; we do not wish to do harm."
"Long life to Nicholas II! If he only
listens to our grievances we are sure
he will be Just and merciful."
"We cannot longer endure our suf
ferings. Better die at once and end
Such were the criea repeatedly
heard. Many strikers brought their
wives and children.
HUKL INSULTS AT TROOPS.
"You soldiers are our brothers; you
cannot shoot these little ones," they
exclaimed.
But as the pickets and patrols con
tinued driving them off the demon
strators began to give way and bitter
Insults and oaths, of which the Rus
sian vocabulary is particularly rich, be
came frequent.
"We are not Japanese; why brutal
ise use? Will yon shame the mother
who bore you, who was a Russian like
ourselves?" were some of the cries
that were heard. Later such expres
sions as "Scoundrels!" "Mercenaries!"
"Dogs!" and worse were heard. A
long-haired student in the crowd
hurled an Insulting epithet at an of
ficer, who sent a couple of men to ar
rest him. The crowd tried to "rescue
the student, but he was dragged and
kicked across the sunlit square, his
long hair tossing in the air. The
crowd broke into hoots and hisses.
Then a young workman jeered at a
soldier, who applied his rifle butt and
with the help of comrades dragged the
workman, despite his piteous pleadings,
to the lockup. Every time the troops
moved the crowds hissed them.
Strikers also gathered at the entrance
of the grand Morskaia and on the ave
nue leading to the Moika canal. The;
crowd at the latter place swelled to!
huge proportions, blockading the bridge
across the canal. The order came at
1:30 p. m. to clear them off. The colonel
commanding, the Horse Guards uttered
a short, sharp command, the troops
drew their swords and advanced at a
quick trot and theh broke into a gallop,
heading straight for the Moika, where
they were lost in a cloud of snow.
Shrieks from the wounded resounded.
Then came a deadly silence, broken
only by the galloping of ambulance
horses.
ADMIRALTY GARDENS BUTCHERY
The next twenty minutes passed
without incident. Nothing indicated
the approach of the horrible butchery
which was destined to stain the corner
of the admiralty gardens with human
blood. The crowd there persisted in re
fusing to move on, clamoring for the
Emperor and continually hurling abuse
at the troops, but attempted no vio
lence. Two companies of the Preobra
jensky Guards, of which Emperor Nich
olas himself was formerly colonel,
which had been standing at ease in
front of the palace, formed and
marched at double quick toward the |
fatal corner.
Events followed with awful swiftness.
The commanding officer shouted, "Dis
perse! Disperse! Disperse!"
Many in the crowd turned>to flee, but
it was too late. A bugle sounded and
the men in the front ranks sank to their
knees and both companies fired three
volleys, the first two with blank cart
ridges and the last with ball. A hun
dred corpses strewed the sidewalk.
Many women were pierced through the
back as they were trying to escape. A
correspondent standing behind the
troops saw mangled corpses of persons
of all ages and both sexes strewn on
the ground. The skull of one boy of 13
years was pierced and rent by bullets.
Great splashes and streams of blood
stained the snow. Only a few of the
victims remained afive, for the fatal
volley was fired at a distance of not
more than twenty paces, and so the
ambulances had little work to do.
The police recruited a large num
ber of droshkies (sleighs) to carry off
the dead.
RELATIVES CLAIM THEIR DEAD.
Heartrending scenes were witnessed
as wives, husbands and mothers came
up to claim their dear ones and were
carried off with them in the sleighs.
Meanwhile the crowd had drifted
up the Nevsky Prospect, yelling "Mur
derers! Murderers!" and the square
resumed its calm aspect, the troops
returning to their stations.
It was now the turn for the crowd
stationed at Morskaia entrance to the
square, where the Horse Guards re
peated the exploit with which they
had cleared the Moika and drove the
people pell mell down the thorough
fare.
From thence forward the Palace
Square ceased to be the center of in
terest. A press correspondent went
to Grand Morskaia and stood an en
tire hour near the corner of the Nev
sky Prospect. The fashionable hotels
on either side of the Grand Morskaia
were crowded, but the doors were
locked, except to well known visitors.
Quite a number of prominent per
sons stood on the sidewalks watching
the developments. Secretary Spencer
Eddy of the American Embassy chat
ted with Grand Duke Boris, who had
driven up in a stylish sleigh drawn by
a magnificent trotter. Bompard, the
French Embassador, drove past with
his wife. As a couple of squadrons of
red capped hussars trotted by the* of
ficers gave the command:
"Use the flat of your swords."
Then the.troopers moved off and
disappeared down the street, the
crowds shrieking "Murderers!"
"Dogs!" but quickly vanishing Before
them. A few who were wounded were
picked up and conveyed to a drug
store on the opposite corner of the
Grand Morskaia and the Nevsky Pros
pect.
ORATOR INFLAMES CROWD.
No troops were visible for as much as
a half-hour. A crowd quickly formed
outside the drug store and an orator
was found for the occasion. Standing
on the steps of the drug store he ad
dressed the impromptu meeting thus:
"ComradesâWe came humbly and
peacefully to meet the Emperor and
lay our grievances before him. But the i
Emperor refused to see us, and instead J
soldiers were sent to shoot us down. â 
Then all I can say is, he is no Em
peror."
"Down with the Emperor!" shouted
the crowd.
"We have suffered under the sway of
the Chinovniks," said the speaker."
Down with the Chinovniks!"
"We hoped for redress, but hope is no
longer possible. We can win our rights

NOGALES, Ariz., Jan. 22.â H. L. Mil
ler and Charles E. Tolerton, who es
caped in Thursday's Indian massacre
in Sonora, Mexico, passed through here
this morning with the bodies of Coy,
MacKenzie, Call and Steubinger, bound
for Chicago. The correct names and
addresses of the men killed are: Dr. R.
C. Coy, 6520 Woodlawn avenue, Chi
cago; John K. MacKenzie, 2614 Indiana
avenue, Chicago: M. A. Call, Sioux
City, lowa, with relatives residing in
Toledo; Walter Steubinger, Kewanee,
Illinois.
Charles E. Tolerton is of Salem, Ohio,
and H. L. Miller is well known in Los
Angeles, where he had. spent the last
few years. Tolerton is a young man
of 25 years and a cousin of Call. â¢
It now appears that the parjy asked
for an escort from the Mexican author
ities at Hermosillo and an order to the
military at La Colorada was issued.
Upon reaching La Colorada the escort
was requested, but the Mexicans re
plied that there were so many in the
party an escort was unnecessary.
Thereupon the party left for Camp To
ledo and reached there without dif
ficulty.
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Forshaw of Color
ado, from either Cripple Creek or Col
orado Springs, were with the party on
the outward trio, but left the main
party before reaching Camp Toledo and
are now in camp and in no danger
whatever. Fred with his
wife and child, went over the same
roftd test Wednesday or Thursday and
undoiH>ft?dly reached their camp. Gar
rettson is from Buffalo and is engaged
in mining in the Sahuaripa district, So
nora. A Mr. Pelletier, a mining engi
neer, recently employed by the Zarasca
Mining Company, is with Garrettson.
All the mining men in the district
where the massacre took place are
cÂ«ming in from camp and the coun
try undoubtedly will be in a feverish
state for some time to come.
It is stated on high authority that
just a month ago Governor Yzabel
held an extended conference "with a
large number of Yaquis at San Miguel
to see if all differences could not be
adjusted, and the Yaquis said that
they demanded all the land along the
Yaqui River and wanted all the Mexi
cans and other settlers there to va
cate. Governor Yzabel replied that
was impossible and the conference
came to an end.
Dr. Coy's body and head were badly
mutilated, his head being mashed in
with stones. His body was stripped of
its clothing as were the other dead.
The survivors got away with their
clothing only, all their money, tickets
and papers being taken by the Iff
dians.
William Chapman Potter, son-in
law of Secretary Morton, has not yet
been located, though it is believed he
will be located to-morrow.
Within seven miles of the scene of
Thursday's tragedy the Yaquis killed
on Friday about noon three Mexicans.
One of the Mexicans was a prominent
man in that section. The Yaqui Cop
per Company men. Brown, Sauntry
and Zetelle probably are at Torres or
Hermosillo. They had "planned to
leave Torres Saturday morning, but
news of the outbreak will probably
turn them back. Brown is a partner
of Senator Thurston and resides in
Washington, D. C, as does also
Zetelle. " Sauntry is from St. J?aul.
The Mexican authorities will make
every effort to capture the Indians,
and if successful swift punishment
will follow.
' Merrill A. Call, one of the victims
of the Yaquis, was formerly a resi
dent of this city, having been em
ployed by the Wagner-Bullock Elec
tric Company. Call was a nephew of
Rev. George W. W r hite of the Central
Methodist Episcopal Church on Mis
sion street.

was uncovered as the victims were
conveyed away.
The wilder element in the crowd had
now got the upper hand and proceeded
to attack every officer in sight. A gen
eral driving up the Nevsky Prospect
was mobbed, with shouts of "Murder
er!" His sword was captured as a tro
phy, the crowds shouting "Hurrah!"
Another general was nearly dragged
from his sleigh, but clutched the driver
desperately, and in escaping was struck
on his bald head by a glass bottle and
stunned. Swords were wrenched from
several passing officers and the crowd
shouted: "Break their swords, but do
not beat them!"
The appearance of several companies
of infantry restored order, but the
crowds refused to disperse and several
volleys were fired and a number of per
sons killed. A half-dozen policemen
were surrounded by a crowd in a
neighboring side street. The policemen
drew their revolvers and fired and one
of them was killed by a comrade's mis
directed Are.
There was a dramatic scene at the
Narva gate when Father Gopon, in
golden vestments, bearing aloft an ikon

religious banners, approached at the
head of the procession of 8000 work
men. Troops were drawn up across the
entrance. Several times an officer
called uoon the procession to stop but
Father Gopon did not falter. Then an
order was given to fire, first with blank
cartridges. Two volleys rang out but
the line still did not waver. Then 'with
seeming reluctance, an officer gave the
command to load with ball, and the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22.âThirty-five
thousand dollars' worth of gems and
jewels were stolen Friday evening in
Pasadena from Mr. and Mrs. William
S. Edey of New York. News of the sen
sational robbery, which was committed
in the Edeys' at tho Hotel
Maryland, was suppressed unt'l to
night, when the police captured the al
leged thief, James Doyle, who has been
head bell boy at the hotel for the last
six months.
In/ Doyle, who came to Pasadena as
F. A. Gaston, the officers believe they
have a criminal who has committed ex
pert robberies throughout the entire
United States. He has passed under
the aliases of Gates, James Walsh and
R. Crandal, and is said to have come
here from San Francisco. If be is the
robber he had accomplices. Cleverly
concealed in the lining of his suit case
were found three valuable articles
stolen from guests of the hotel. Other
incriminating evidence has been un
earthed.
Friday afternoon Edey was playing
golf at the Los Angeles Country Club
i and did not return to his apartments
until late. iMrs. Edey went out riding
at 5 o'clock, and between that hour and
8 o'clock their rooms were entered, the
lock of the trunk containing the jew
elry was picked with a button hook
! and the gem casket emptied. The job

ing overlooked. Mrs. Edey had always
left her valuables in the hotel office
when going out, but Friday in her
haste she failed to do so.
None; of the stolen articles have been
â¢recovered. They are supposed to be
hidden about the hotel premises, prob
ably on the grounds, and to-night the
police are on guard, while many eager
searchers are trying to get in. Edey,
who is a member of the New York
Stock Exchange and wealthy, offers
large rewards for the _ recovery of the
treasures, many of which are heirlooms.
Among the missing Jewels is a heart
shaped watch, the back closely studded
with diamonds and valued at $2800; a
horseshoe pin two inches across, set
with diamonds and worth $8000: a ring
set with three large and rare diamonds,
worth $6000, and necklaces, bracelets,
drop, chains and other pieces set with
rubies, diamonds, pearls and sapphires.
The ring the robber overlooked is worth
$1000.

Count Cassini plainly was greatly

State Department officials, and es

Through confidential reports from

â¢ they long have known that the war
with Japan was more unpopular in
Russia than the outside world believed

thrft it will be impossible to restore
peace In Russia until the war with
Japan is ended, and they expect the
revolt to have a prompt effect in forcing
the Czar to open peace negotiations
with Japan. On the supposition that
the disaffection among the troops Is not

EUROPE BELIEVES REVOLUTIONARY
MOVEMENT HAS BUT BEGUN.
GOVERNMENT NOW REALIZES
TEMPER OF. THE POPULACE
LONDON, Jan. 23.âSuch phrases as
these, extracted from editorial articles
in the London morning newspapers, in
dicate the opinion held here of yester
days' events at St. Petersburg:
"Revolt has been quelled, but revolu
tion begun." /
"The bureaucracy has declared its
policy; it is the policy of Blagovest
chenkâ'massacre.''
"The inevitable reaction has begun,
and with it a new chapter in Russia's
history and probably also in the his
tory of Europe and Asia."
"The revolutionary movement In
Russia has received its baptism of
blood, its crown of martyrdom."
"Is there a Mirabeau or even a Dan
ton in Russia to-day?"
"A very grave responsibility lies to
day at the door of the Czar, who failed
to grasp his unique opportunity."
"The 'Little Father' has become the
murderer of his people, and it remains
with him to save the country from dis
aster. Even at the eleventh hour he
may do so, but only by recognizing
that autocracy has gone forever."
It is pointed out that the fate of Rus
sia does not depend upon the people of
St. Petersburg alone, but on the masses
throughout the country, and it is con
sidered that the events recent
months connected with the agitation
for constitutional reform sufficiently
attest the people's temper.
Some of the special dispatches from
St. Petersburg this morning comment
upon the unexpectedly determined at
titude displayed by the Russian work
men yesterday as revealing a new
phase in the character of the patient
masses.
Many special correspondents give ex
travagant reports. For instance, the
correspondent of the Dally Mail says
that 20,000 people from Kolpino were
met at the Moscow arch, on the con
fines of St. Petersburg, with six vol
leys and that 1000 fell dead and 1500
wounded. Other correspondents state
that the workmen have proclaimed
their intention to attack private prop
erty and that Minister of the Interior
Sviatopolk-Mirsky has consented to
receive a deputation of workmen to
day. While many estimate the casual
ties at anywhere near 2000 killed and
wounded, there is everywhere conclu
sive evidence of the Impossibility of
yet estimating with any degree of ex
actitude.
APPREHENSION IN FRANCE.
Feared That French Scenes Will Be
Re-enacted in Russia.
PARIS, Jan. 22.âThe news of the
bloody events In St. Petersburg has
caused a profound sensation here. The
newspapers issued special editions
throughout the evening, giving the
dramat'c details of the street fighting,
and these were eagerly read and dis
cussed in the boulevards, at the the
aters and in other public places the
tragedy being the one subject of com
ment. The newspaper offices were sur
rounded by crowds awaiting bulletins.
Officials here have received advices
practically the same as those made
public.
The general view, including that of
officials, is one of the deepest appre
hension that the events of to-day may
precipitate in Russia a period of revo
lution such as France has witnessed.
FLEET MAY MAKE DASH.
TOKIO, Jan. 28.âVieÂ« Admiral
Kamimura left to-day to rejoin his
fleet. It was recently announced that
the Russian Vladivostok squadron was
believed to have been repaired and
might come out at any moment.
The Navy Department is strenuous
ly preparing for the second stage of
the war. During the year past the
Japanese have captured twenty-three
blockade runners, of which thirteen
were Russian and seven British. The
recent captures of coal amounts to
twenty-five thousand tons.
RUSSIA HILLIS' THEME.
Says Empire Has Neglected the Lesson
of Freedom.
CHICAGO, Jan. 22.â"Russia has
neglected the lesson of freedom so elo
quently taught by history," declared
Rev. Newel Dwight Hillis of Plymouth
Church, Brooklyn, in a sermon before
his old congregation of Central Church,
preached in the Auditorium to-nisht.
"A new statement of our lesson is to
be found," he said, "in connection with
that great empire of Europe, which
now is disturbed with the preliminary
tremblings of a social earthquake.
Three hundred yearsago the conditions
which prevail in Russia to-day could
be found in England.
"Later, in France, a noble, when the
poor people of Paris asked for bread,
said: 'Let them eat grass,' and the
next day they butchered him in the
streets. To-day we find in Russia a
nation where the lives of the lower
classes are filled with misery and
squalor. In the warm, rich atmosphere
of the twentieth century these condi
tions exist. One part of society, ar
rayed against the lower classes, is say
ing 'We will be blind to the teachings
of history,' and is ignoring the inevit
able consequences which follow the en
slaving of human souls and bodies. A
little handful of men own all the land,
possess all the titles, hold all the priv
ileges. This is a country of which it
can be truly said: 'The lessons of his
tory have been in vain.' But. perhaps,
even now that lesson Is upon us."

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â"This com
mission will beyond any doubt report
to the Attorney General next week that
the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Rail
road has been guilty of what appears
to be a willful violation of the Elkins
law. This report will be accompanied
by a draft of the evidence taken by the
commission and in view of this action,
I do not see how the Department of
Justice can refrain from instituting
prosecutions against the railroad."
This statement was made to-day by a
member of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. The prosecution of the
Santa Fe Railroad by the Government
will be most embarrassing to Secretary
of the Navy Morton, who was executive
officer of that corporation during the
tfcne when the alleged rebates were
given.
"The commission has ended its in
vestigation of this matter," said the
commissioner, "and is now engaged in
preparing a statement for the Attorney
General. This will be ready for trans
mittal next week. Our last hearing
was on December 29, but President
Ripley of the Santa Fe asked for a
subsequent hearing, and the case was
held open until January 16. A few
days before that date he canceled his
request. â¢
"The fact that a member of the Cabi
net may become involved makes no
difference to the commission. While
I have not talked with the President,
I feel sure that he would not care to
interfere one way or the other. The
punishment cannot be less than a fine
of $1000 nor more than $20,000 for each
offense. If each shipment in which a
rebate was allowed constitutes a sep
arate offense, tad total fine to which
the Santa Fe is Tfable will run up into
hundreds of thousands of dollars.''
Attorney General Moojiy may differ
from the members of the Interstate
Commerce Commission regarding the
findings after a review of the testi
mony.
DRUNKEN BRAWL
ENDS IN DEATH
Giuseppe Brgardo Is Shot
Down on Powell Street by

old "Holmes Castle," in which so many
women were murdered, and that he has
profited so well by the training of his
employer, H. H. Holmes, who was
hanged in Philadelphia, that he has
already murdered ten women, is the
belief of the police after to-day's de
velopments.
The last link in the chain of evi
dence, that is being welded, is a state
ment from Mrs. Anna Hendrickson of
Englewood, that she believes she was
married to Hock a year ago. Mrs.
Hendrickson told the police to-day that
a man answering Hock's description
married her in Hammond, md., and
live weeks later deserted her, taking
with him JSOO, belonging to her.
The story- told by Mrs. Hendrickson
seemed so important to the police that
to-day two detectives accompanied her
to the cottage where Mrs. Marie
Walcker Hock died. Here a shoe of
peculiar formation, worn by Hock ow
ing, it is said, to large bunion on his
foot, was found. "The man who mar
ried me under the name of Hendrick
son used to wear just such a shoe,"
said Mrs. Hendrickson.
The police refuse to reveal the wom
an's address, but she Is being kept in
hiding until her story is thoroughly in
vestigated.
Captain Madden of the Englewood
station has detailed Lieutenant Storen
on the case, and it is believed that
Hock will be captured in a few hours,
as the police are fairly sure of his
hiding place.
Late to-day another woman ap
peared and told the police of having
been married to Hock. She Mrs.
Schmidt, who oiaims to have been mar
ried in 1&04, and deserted by her hus
band three weeks later. Lieutenant
JStoren said to-night that he believed
to, be the former associate of the
notorious Holmes.
"I believe it possible that this man
Hock was the janitor of 'Holmes
Castle.' " said Lieutenant Storen. "He
answers the description of the janitor
who disappeared after testifying In be
half of Holmes. Another thing that
makes me believe as I do is that Hock
Mas seen to-day In a barber shop at
703 Sixty-third street. This is the old
â¢Holmes Castle' in which so many
women were said to have been mur
dered by Holmes." â¢
Police Inspector Shippy said to-day
that he is in possession of evidence,
which causes him to believe that Hock
had murdered at least ten women.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
LIVED AGES BEFORE
THE SIERRAS ROSE
Merriam's Saurians Shed Light
on Age of the World.
BERKELEY, Jan. 22.âProfessor
John C. Merriam of the geological de
partment of the State University last j
night made public the results of dis- 1
coveries for which he is responsible,
that are expected to revolutionize
theories held by scientists regarding
the origin and descent of Ichthyosaurs, 1
nshsaurians whose fossils have been
the subject of extensive study by geo- J
1 agists and scientists in general, and ,
. which studies have thrown valuable
light vtpon the formation of the world
and the character of its reptile life
ages ago.
Professor Merriam has contributed
his discoveries to the scientific press
of the country and the result is ex
pected to stir greatly that Bection of
thinkers. incidentally the field of
palaeontologic research in California
naturally will have the center of the
stage, as the theories of Professor
Merriam foilow discoveries made by
him in the mountain ranges of the
State.
The California savant's deductions
are couched in scientific terms diffi
cult of comprehension by the people,
but their significance relates to
changes of opinion regarding the orig
in of the Ichthyosaurs, which he
thinks must follow as the result of
new discoveries of Ichthyosaur fauna.
HAS RIGHT TO SPEAK.
Dr. Merriam's right to speak au
thoritatively on the subject may be in
: ferred from the place of honor given
him by Henry Fairfield Osborn, Da
Costa professor of zoology in Colum
bia University, and curator in the
American museum of natural history,
who in a recent notable article on
Ichthyosaurs, contributed to the Cen
tury magazine, begins his article with
a reference to "an expedition'from the
University of California which dis
. covered in rocks of Triassic age, un
der the shadows of Mount Shasta, re
mains of a new type of nshsaurlan,
â  which was appropriately named Shas
tasaurus by Professor Merriam. This
led to the proofs of the existence in
Northern California of a large and
very ancient bay of the Pacific Ocean
during a period long previous to the
elevation of the Sierra Nevada range."
Henry Fairfield Osborn is looked
â¢ upon as the highest authority on this
and kindred subjects in America and
his readiness to accord Professor
Merriam distinction and equal footing
with him is considered sufficient ex
cuse to regard the California man as
one qualified to discuss in a tone of
authority the involved subject of Ich
â¢ thyosaurs.
Professor Merriam has this to say
of his most recent discoveries as they
relate to Ichthyosaur specimens:
Professor George Baur furnished evidence
that the limbs of the Jurassic Ichthyosaur are
highly specialised structures, developed in
adaptation to aquatic life. He showed that
limbs of the triassic Ichthyosaur come nearer
to the type of the extremity found in primitive
reptllia than do those of later .-representatives
of that order. When Baur wrote the only
available triassic specimens showing limbs
were from'bituminous shales of Besano, L*wn
bardy. These he separated from iohthyosaur
and called them a new genusâmixosaurus.
fhe California triasslc developed collections of
new groups of Ichthyosaur differing in impor
tant particulars from the genera of Europe.
NEW LIGHT FOUND.
So many new forms have appeared in this
fauna that some of the questions relating to,
the origin and descent of the Ichthyosaur must
now be reopened. The addition of the new

material has made the problem more compli
cated. .
We mm know tii&t there are four type of
limbuâmixosaurus, toretocremus. shastasaurus
nnd Alexandra*. The fourth api**â¢ In * ,re *'
cently discovered specimen which seems to be
practically Identical with shastasaurus per
rlniâa genua distinct âao we shall call it del
phlnosaurus. The mixosaurus' extremities are
of the primitive type. Those of the delphiao
saurus are characterised by much elongated
vertebral centra, an unnotched scapula and a
humerus as broad as it Is long.
The mixosaurus Is the oldest described form
In which the limb structure is known. Beds
in which it occurs are considered byrfYaas a*
the equivalent of some portion of the middle
triasslc, while the California genera belong to
the upper triasslc.
A comparison of the Jurassic and triasslc
genera of the Ichthyoaaur With a View to de
termining the lines of descent shows Immedi
ately that no known jurasslc form can be con
sidered as having descended from the special-'
Ued shasfasaurus. 80 far as we know this
group disappeared in the triasslc.
It should be borne in mind that while the
evidence furnished by limb structure is some
of the most valuable material that we can ob
tain for use In "working out the phyloseny of
the Ichthyosaur. it can hardly furnish tha
whole foundation for a definite classification.
Inside the American group there seems to
be considerable variation, though as yet we
do not know alt the most Important charac
ters of these forms.
It is perhaps a significant fact that of the
several genera toretocremus. with the largest
vestlgal fourth digit, appears in Its general
structure to be nearest to some of the earlier
forma of . Europe presented by ichthyosaur
atavas from the lower portion of the middle
triassic.
The "Alexandrae" type referred to by
Professor Merrtam waÃ named by him
after Miss A M. Alexander, of Oak
land, a young woman who has taken
part In Professor Merriam's expeditions
and herself has contributed notably to
some of the results attained on these
trips. .
The significance of Professor Mer
riam's technical discussions of changes
In bone structure found in ichthyosaur
fossils may be better understood when
It is known, for example, that these
bone changes are coincident with the
Ichthyosaurus development from a
land-moving form to a reptile, or ani
mal fitted for aquatic life. In such a
transformation, which, Professor Os
born says in his article before referred
to, would have delighted the eye of
Darwin, a Jointed limb gradually dis
solves into a fin composed of flattened
plates; the distinction between the
forearm, the wrist and the hand dis
appears; and numerdus small addi
tional joints are added to the tips of
the fingers so that Instead of the five
Joints found In the longest finger of
the tuatera lizard as many as sixteen
Joints are finally developed on the mid
dle finger of the Ichthyosaur.
Borne conception of the enormons
length of the reign of the ichthyosaurs,
says Professor Merriam, quoting Os
born, and of the profound changes
which occurred in the North American
continent while It was progressing may
be had when It is known that when
the Ichthyosaurs first took to the sea
the Appalachian chain of mountains
was just completing Its upheaval;
while they were In the height of their
prosperity the Sierra Nevadas arose on
the western border of fhe continent;
while they were undergoing their de
cline and approaching extinction the
Rocky mountain range and the region
of the great plains were rising from the
sea. The whole history of their dis
persal on the high seas therefore took
place during a period roughly esti
mated in our scale at eight millions of
years.
RIPE CHERRIES
IN MIDWINTER
Splendid Specimens of This
Fruit on Exhibition at
Oakland Board of Trade
Oakland Office San Fraaotooo Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 22.
An assortment of choice ripe fruits
of varieties seldom seen, even in Cali
fornia, in midwinter, and never in any
other State, is an exhibition ?' the
headquarters of the Oakland Board of
Trade. Among the exhibits are fully
formed ripe cherries, a lot of large and
ripe raspberries, some ripe loganber
ries and blackberries and several clus
ters of ripe currants. All of these
fruits were picked from trees and
bushes growing in Alameda County
gardens and matured and ripened in
the open air.
On several occasions before Christ
mas raspberries have been placed on
exhibition In Oakland, but so far as is
known this is the first time ripe cher
ries have been gathered in January.
These cherries, which are fully ma
tured and perfectly formed, came from
trees at the homes of Irving R. Whit
ney of Berkeley and Oscar Lunlng of
this city and from the ranch of the
Neppach brothers in Fruitvale.
The first cherries sent to the Board
of Trade came from the home of Irv
ing R. Whitney, 1431 Hawthorne ter
race, Berkeley, and were gathered on
January 11 from a tree In the garden.
A few days later Oscar Lunlng of 3855
Telegraph avenue sent In several cher
ries and yesterday the Neppach broth
errs of Fruitvale sent an exhibit of
Black Tartarian cherries and crab
apples.
The fruits and berries now displayed
at' the Board of Trade rooms, at 610
Twelfth street, completely fill one of
the large show windows and the ex
hibit is attracting much attention.

WITH SONG
ON HER LIPS
Mrs. Mary L. Callender Falls
Victim of Insane Cook
While She and Husband
Sing the "Rock of Ages"
JAMES FERGUSON THEN
ENDS HIS OWN LIFE
Faithful Servant Suddenly
Loses His Reason, Kills
Benefactress, Then Runs
: Away and Shoots Himself
OAKLAND, Jan. 22.âWith the words
of "Rock of Ages'' on her Hps, Mrs.
Mary L. Callender, an aged negress,
was shot and killed to-night by James
Ferguson, a negro cook, who ran
amuck at the Callender home, 179 Third
street. John T. Callender, the woman's
husband, was also a target for the
crazed man's bullets, but escaped in-
Jury. Ferguson fled and was found an
hour afterward by the police at First
and Alice streets, where he had shot
himself twice in the head, lodging a
bullet in each ear. Ferguson died at
the Receiving Hospital at 11 o'clock
while the surgeons were trying to re
move the bullets from his head.
The aged couple were sitting in the
kitchen singing gospel hymns, as their
custom had been for many years on
Sunday nights. Fifteen minutes before
the shooting Ferguson, who has lived
with them for years, was talking in an
other room to Joseph Oates, a boy, who
also lived at the house. The boy wen,
to bed Just before 8 o'clock. A few min
utes afterward, while the old folk
were at their humble devotions, the
back doer of the kitchen suddenly
banged open and Ferguson burst into
the room upon the couple. With a
pistol In each hand he yelled, "Give
me $26." Before either Callender or his
wife could utter a word, Ferguson
fired twice. One bullet struck the old
woman in the neck and she fell to the
floor, mortally wounded.
HUSBAND ESCAPES.
The second shot. Intended for the
husband, missed him, but the shock
prostrated the old man. The demented
pistol wlelder disappeared. Callender
called for help. Several people In the
house responded, including Mrs. P.
Taylor, a daughter, who called the po
lice. The wounded woman died on the
way to the Receiving Hospital. The
body was taken to the Morgue. Chief

up the hunt for the murderous negro,
and after a search through the lower
side of the city traced him to the spot
where he was found. He was lying on
i the platform of an abandoned flour
mill. Shots had been heard in the
neighborhood soon after Ferguson left
the Callender house and it was sus
pected he had tried to end his own Ufa
Old man Callender declared the shoot
ing of his wife was a murder without
the slightest provocation. Said he:
Ferguson was a bit out of his head at times,
but he never acted violently. A few year* aso
he talked about killing a mac over some money
troubles, but that all blew over. He had lived
with us for years, cooking- and doing- chores
about the house. Before that he had gone to
sea as a cook. The only reason I can give for
his crime Is that he suddenly went oraay and
Intended to kill both of ua I took oars of him
because be was a oountryman of mine and was
handy about the house. Tills crime was a ter
rible reward for the kindness my poor wife and
I had always shown him.
NO QUARREL.
Callender and his family insisted
there had been no trouble to arouse
Ferguson's anger. Oates said the man
had seemed rational and was quietly
talking with him shortly before he went
wild. Ferguson, because of his wounds,
could not talk about the shooting. As
he was lying on the operating table he
muttered, "The pistol was bad." The
weapon found near him by the police
was a cheap one of bulldog pattern
carrying a large-caliber bullet. It con
tained two empty sheila Examination
showed that all of the five chambers
had contained recently discharged
cartridges.
Mrs. Callender was shot through the
left side of the neck, the bullet plowing
downward and penetrating the heart.
She was 68 years old, a native of Phila
delphia. Besides Mrs. Taylor, there is
another daughter, Mrs. Ellen Painer.
Callender is known in shipping circles
in San Francisco, where for years he
conducted a sailor boarding-house on
Broadway, near Davis street. He
amassed considerable money and had
investments in several whalers and
other vessels sailing out of San Fran
cisco.
Ferguson was unmarried, about 46
years old and a native of the British
West Indies. His body was taken to the
Morgue.

Oakland Restaurant Owners
Declare Change Will Be
Made on February First
NO TROUBLE EXPECTED
Proprietors Will Receive the
Support of the Bakers and
the Citizens' Alliance
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 22.
The long Impending fight for the
"open shop" in the restaurants of this
city will begin on Wednesday, Feb
ruary 1. The restaurateurs who are
members of the Restaurant Keepers'
Protective Association of Oakland will
then remove the union cards from their
places and substitute for them the
"open shop" cards of the association.
The proprietors of thirty-two of the
largest restaurants in the city are
members of the protective association,
which is backed by the Citizens' Alli
ance, and all of these owners have put
up certified checks as bonds to stand
by the open shop.
The restaurant owners will he sup
ported by the Citizens' Alliance in ease
trouble follows. Trouble is not ex
pected, for there will be no change in
wages or hours. The employes in the
various restaurants will simply be In
formed that no discrimination against
non-union men and women will be
shown In the future.
The proprietors of several of the
larger bakeries In Oakland have allied
themselves with the restaurant keepers'
association, and they have promised
that should trouble result from the
movement, they will also declare for
the open shop.
The officials of the local Cooks' and
Walters' Union refused to-day to dis
cuss the coming change, except to say
that plans to meet any move made by
the Citizens' Alliance had already been
agreed upon by the members of the
union.

STEALS WIFE
AND PET RAZOR
Pullman Car Porter Carries
Off Spouse and the Per
sonal Effects of His Host
SUPERSTITION TONS OUT
Elopement Occurs on Friday,
the 13th, and Husband Be
lieves He Was "Hoodooed"
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway,' Jan. 22.
It was on Friday, the 13th day of Jan
uary, that William Wiggins lost his
wife. Wiggins is therefore a confirmed
devotee at the altar of superstition.
Mrs. Wiggins, according to her lament
ing spouse, eloped with a friend of the
family, one J. H. West, who won his
way to the heart of the susceptible
helpmeet and stole her from the discon
solate Wiggins,
Not, however, for West*s theft of the
runaway wife did Wiggins repair to
the Police Court and swear to a war
rant for his former friend's arrest on a
Charge of larceny. Wiggins complained
that West pilfered a lot of his personal
effects. Including wearing apparel, when
he made off with Mrs. Wiggins. When
the abandoned husband made that dis
covery he went on the trail of the
missing Dalr to avenge the double
crime. Wiggins searched high and low.
He pursued the runaways across the
â¢bay and traced them back and forth
until to-day, when with polios help
West was arrested at Merced.
"He wasn't satisfied to take my
, wife," said the deserted man, "but
along with the rest of the stuff he took
my pet razor."
Police Captain Wilson telegraphed
the Merced authorities to hold West
until he could be sent for. Mrs. Wig
gins is supposed to be with her ad
mirer.
West Is a Pullman oar porter and
lived at 1717 Atlantlo street with Wig
gins, who is a Southern Paclflo cook.

ROUVIER NAMES
HIS MINISTERS
Delcasse to Remain at Head
of the Foreign Office in
the New French Cabinet
PARIS, Jan. 88.âIt waa announced
to-night that Rouvier had succeeded
in forming a Ministry and would to
morrow inform President Loubet of
his acceptance of the Premiership,
with the names of those forming the
Cabinet. Following is an approximate
list of the new Ministry:

phlle Delcasse.
Minister of JusticeâJean Sarrlen.
Minister of the Interior âEugene
Etienne. s>

ment. The prospective Cabinet met
to-night in Rouvler's office and went
over the situation at some length. It

ference will appear when Rouvier

CONSUL TELLS
OF MASSACRES
Dr. Norton Says That Fiv<Â»
Thousand Armenians Were
Slain During the Summer
TOURS THE DISTRICT
Pays a Tribute to the Work
Done by the Americans
in the Affected Region^
WA BHINGTON, Jan. I ft.âThe
State Department has made public
portions of an Important report
recently made by Thomas H, Nor
ton. American Consul at Harput, Tur
key, on the results of a tour of in
vestigation made by him, under in
structions from the department,
through the vilayets of Bltlis and Van,
which were the scenes during several
months last summer of repeated at
tacks upon and massacres of Armen
ian Christians by the Kurds and other
elements of the Moslem population.
These disturbances, attended by
frightful atrocities and savage cruelty,
resulted in death, suffering and desti
tution.
The principal object of the visit was
for the better protection of American
Interests there and the timely arrival
of Dr. Norton, it is said, contributed to
a peaceful termination. No Americans
were known to have been injured.
Dr. Norton says Mush is practically
an armed camp, where Armenians are
In constant terror. He estimates In
the Sassun district that 6000 lives
were lost in last summer's massacres,
including 2771 children. Several thou
sand refugees, who fled to Mush, were
forced to return to their ruined vil
lages, where the vilayet authorities
made an allowance of 1 cent per capi
ta for food. The question of the mo
ment, he says, is what is to be done
to save the surviving population of
Sassun, numbering 10,000 or more,
from the results of insufficient protec
tion and Insufficient food.
He speaks of the American schools
and Institutions, and says the mission
aries have much prestige. One salient
fact, says the Consul, is that the
benevolence of the citizens has ac
complished morÂ© than the efforts, of
other nations combined in advancing
the moral and intellectual welfare of
the Armenians and other classes in
the interior provinces. Tribute Is paid
to the comparatively small group of
American workers. He says the tide
of emigration Is directed almost ex
clusively to America, and that there
is an increasing number of American
citizens who have interests in the dis
turbed regions.

ARE IN COLLISION.
LADY MINE IS NEARLY
. WRECKED BY THE NEKO
Seas Toss the Ships Together
The pilot-boat Lady Mine was in col- |
llsion with the Kosmos liner Neko just
outside the Golden Gate yesterday
morning and came nearly being sent to
the "bottom of the ocean.
The Neko. in command of Captain H.
Rlckman, was proceeding out to sea in
â charge of Pilot John Wallace Jr. She
had just arrived off the south bank
buoy when Pilot Wallace signaled to
Captain William Kelly, in command of
the Lady Mine, to cqfie alongside and
take him off.
The wind was blowing fresh from the
south and a nasty, choppy, high sea
was running. A yawl was sent from
"the Lady Mine to the Neko for Captain
Wallace, and he was just about to
board the Lady Mine when a sudden
. squall and a great mass of surging
waters drove the pilot-boat and steam
ship together. The Neko was lifted
â high by a mighty wave and her stern
driven far out of water. As It came
down it struck the little Lady Mine;
with a terrific crash. Had the pilot- â 
boat not floated clear of the big steam- ;
ship at that very instant she would â¢
certainly have been smashed to pieces. |
The Neko struck the Lady Mine full (
amidships and caught the main boom ,
of the pilot-boat, carrying It completely j
away, and smashed twenty of the i
stanchions. At this instant another j
great wave drove the two vessels apart
as suddenly as its predecessor had
breught them together.
In the midst of the turmeil and con
fusion Captain Wallace made a flying
leap from the little yawl for the deck |
â of the pilot-boat. He was caught in the â¢
billows and thrown square on the deck
of the Lady Mine. He miraculously es
â¢ caped without injury.
â¢ The damage to the pilot-boat will
amount to about JIOOO. The Lady Mine
â¢ puf about and came back to port, while
â¢the Neko proceeded on her way to
southern ports en route to Hamburg.
Nearly Drifts on Alcatraz.
The French bark Boesuet, Inward bound,
came near being dashed to pieces on Alcatras
Island lata Saturday night. She crossed In
.through the Golden Gate shortly after 10
' o'clock, and when about off Melggs wharf
..dropped her starboard anchor. A strong flood
' tide was running at the time and the anchor,
'with. Its eighty fathoms of chain, was tern
clean away from the keelson.
Captain Ancelln then ordered the port anchor
let go. This shared the fate of the first one.
like it being torn with its chain away from
the keelson and dropped to the bottom of the
bay. This left the ship entirely at the meroy
of a brick wind, a swashy sea and a strong
tide. . Pilot "Newt" Jordan, who was bringing
the vessel In, saw at once that the ship was
In a terrible predicament. He ordered all kinds
of signals to be sent up calling for assistance.
. Blue lights, red lights, skyrockets were flred off
In' all directions, but to no avail. No help
. came.
The ship was fast drifting down toward Al
catraz. The night was stormy and dark. All
bands were piped on deck, and after a hurried
discussion between captain and pilot It was
decided to set sails and try if possible to beach
her. By the time they got the vessel under steer
age way she had drifted to within fifty feet of
the northern point of Alcatras. By great ex
pertness of maneuvering on the part of captain
and crew they wore her around the north end
of the island, then brought her to and sailed
her out Into the channel through the straits be
tween Alcatras and Angel Islands.
The bark was then headed direct for the mud
â¢ flats Just west of Berkeley and was beached
there. Here she remained upright until noon
yesterday, when the tugs Sea Witch and Sea
Prince hauled her off with little effort. She
was towed over to the seawall, where she now
â¢lies. Captain Ancelln says the Bossuet has
f-uffercd no damage of any kind. She Is 63
. says from Newcastle, Australia, and brings
. tons of coal consigned to J. &A. Brown.
Busy Unloading Manchuria.
A big gang of stevedores was busy all day
yesterday discharging the cargo of the Man
' churia, so that she may load and be ready to
sail on Saturday for the Orient.

day for Manila. She Is to take her complement
of first-class passengers and a full cargo of

GAME LAWS
TROUBLESOME
Strife Expected When the
Legislators Seek to Control
the Man Behind the Gun ;
NEEDS OF BAKERSFIELI)|
â¢ -
Senator Emmons Declaresl
the Kern County City Is in I
Urave Danger From Floods
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 22.âThe dis
tricting of the State will be the main
feature of game legislation this year.
It is probable that whatever bill Is j
passed will provide for the forming of
two districts, with the Tehachapl range
as the dividing line. The main reason
for the contemplated division is a de
sire on the part of the people of South
ern California to prohibit the killing of
deer in their section for a period of at
least five years. The 'northern sports
men would oppose such a radical step, '
and division is looked upon as the only
means of securing satisfactory legisla
tion regarding the deer In both ends of
the State.
The biggest wrangle to be produced
by game legislation will come over an
attempt that is to be made to stop the
sale of ducks altogether, the same as
the sale of quail has been stoppedâthat
is, as far as it can be by legislation.
Epicures, dealers and restaurant men
allowed the quail to be taken out of
reach of all but those who went forth
and shot them, but the duck is not go
ing to be eliminated with the same
ease. The few months when ducks are
salable is a season of joy to the people
who like their flavor and can afford to
pay for them and of profit to the ca
terer and the market man. They will
all use influence to defeat a measure
taking the duck from the general table,
i Various plans for the licensing of
I hunters by placing a tax on guns are
being considered and legislation will be
attempted In this line, though it does
not look like it would be popular. Many
j people keep a gun about who never kill
I a duck, quail or deer. Among the plans
of license is one to impose upon clti
-1 sens a yearly license fee of $1 and on
aliens a fee of $10 a year.
A bill Introduced by Senator Emmons !
! will be reported upon this week by the
I upper house Committee on Drainage,
1 Swamp and Overflowed Lands, and
! then the members will hear a story of
i a danger that threatens Bakersfield
! that is sure to speed their action on
! the measure. Senator Emmons' bill
provided for the appropriation of $60,000
', for the erection of a system of em
bankments and levees to confine the
Kern River to its channel Just where It
debouches from the mountains above
Bakersfield. i
The Committee on Corporations has a
i bill, introduced by Shortridge, under
; consideration that promises to develop
all kinds of a row on the floor. This
bill If passed will require that every
| firm or corporation formed or organized
| under the laws of any State or country
1 other than California engaged in the
' business of indemnifying employers
and others against loss or damage for
personal Injuries or death to employes
or others shall deposit in the StMe
treasury not less than $100,000 for the ;
protection of policy holders.

PORTLAND, Jan. 22 â The steamship
George W. Elder, which left Portland
last night for San Francisco, struck a
rock in the Columbia River near Goble,
forty miles from here, about midnight
and stove a hole in her port side a
short distance forward of amidships,
and she sank in about fifteen feet of
water.
The accident was caused by the rud-
I der becoming fouled by a snag. While
[in this helpless condition and before
j she could be stopped she left the chan
; nel and piled upon a jagged rock which
i lies near the bank of the river.
The river steamer Hassalo, which left
this city for Astoria about the same
I time as the Elder, went to the assist
i ance of the steamship and brought her
' passengers back to this city.
L A force of longshoremen was sent im
; mediately to the disabled vessel for the
i purpose of unloading her, which will
j consume -about two days. The Elder
i will be brought to this city and dry
j docked, when the full extent of the
damage will be made known.

mained so until death.
Experts estimate that young Croker
was driving his machine at a speed of
a mile in forty seconds. They say that
no machine ever built could stand the
strain of a sharp turn while Koine at
that speed.
Stanley, on the motor cycle, was di
rectly in the course of the racer, and
to Croker--it must have appeared al
most certain death to attempt to make
the sharp turn to get out of the way
of the small'machine ahead of him.
Croker's mechanic, Rolen, was in
stantly killed. One side of his head was
crushed. ..Stanley was taken to St. Au
gustine this morning, where he will re
ceive further attention at the railway
hospital.
The fatal accident, coming almost at
the opening of the annual tournament,
has cast-a gloom over the racers leath
ered here, and those who drive their
own machines in the races will insist
upon the adoption and enforcement of
rigid rules to . Insure them against
every accident..

AS AN OBSERVER
Surgeon W. C, Braisted Will
Study Oriental Methods
for Handling the Wounded
LEAVES ON MANCHURIA
Is Assigned to Special Duty
in the Far East by the
Surgeon General of Navy
Lieutenant Commander W. C. Braist
ed, surgeon in the United States navy,
is at the St. Francis Hotel awaiting the
departure of the steamship Manchuria
for Japan, whither he is going under
instructions from Washington as a spe
cial observer for the Navy Department.
Although he declined to discuss his
mission last night, it was learned that
Surgeon Braisted will watch the opera
tions of the Japanese naval forces, to
which he expects to be assigned, and
will make a careful inspection of the
hospitals and note the success of all
modern appliances used by the Japa
nese in rendering their hospitals sani
tary.
The officer will go direct to Tokio
and will there begin his visit to the
larger hospitals. Later he expects to
be assigned to some of the war vessels
and hospital ships for the purpose of
permitting him to look into the tran>
portation of wounded at sea, a study
which few surgeons have had an op
portunity to enjoy in the present war
and which, as a matter of fact, is some
thing new to the world.
Eventually the officer expects to get
near the Japanese firing line to exam
ine men who have been wounded by
the modern guns, and will follow the
wounded to the rear with a view to
comparing the methods of the Japa
nese hospital corps with those of this
country. The result of his observations
will be incorporated in a report to the
surgeon general of the navy. Com
mander Braisted is an experienced
naval surgeon. He was formerly at
tached to the New York hospital and
some time ago was assigned to duty on
this coast to supervise the fitting out
of the Relief. He has since been at
tached to the battleship Ohio. His mis
sion in Japan is expected to extend
over a period of six months, if not
longer.

LESS SNAP TO TRADE LAST WEEK.
% âââââââ
WHILE there were no especially salient features to trade last
week, the week was hardly up to its two predecessors in vim
and snap. True, the volume of business, as indicated by the
bank clearings, was 33.8 per cent above that of the corresponding
week in 1904, and the clearings themselves mounted to the very re
spectable aggregate of $2,825,955,000; but certain conditions, point
ing to another possible lull, appeared. *
The most significant condition in this direction was a visible
preponderance of production over consumption. Of late the tendency
has been just the other way, and the country has been consuming
manufactured products as fast as they were turned out, but several
important branches of industry are now sending in reports of a
different complexion. Prominent among these is the iron and steel
trade, which reports the winter demand less urgent, with foundry
iron and Bessemer pig slightly lower in consequence. Provisions, too,
are meeting with a slow cash demand, and prices have been shaded
all along the line, though the feeling was firmer at the close. As iron
and steel and provisions are considered about the surest and most
prompt indicators of the condition of trade, it is natural to infer
that the general distributive demand of the country is hardly up to
its previous volume. In fact, this condition is flatly reported by
Southern sources, the reason ascribed being the current depression
in the cotton industry, the low price of the product having depressed
all branches of business and retarded collections materially in that
half of the country. This is affirmed by the clearing-house exhibits
of the Southern cities, which almost uniformly showed a loss last
week, while those of the rest of the country showed a general gain.
But the increase in the Northern and Western States more than off
set the decrease in the Southern States, so the 'net result over the
country as a whole was favorable. The failures for the week num- .
bered 335, against 358 for the same week last year.
The great staples are irregular in their returns. The woolen
industry continues in excellent condition. Lumber on the whole is
strong at better prices than ruled last year, but some sections report
dullhess. The sugar market has ruled very strong, and copper has
lately been in brisk demand, with rising prices. Hides are irregular,
and subject to local conditions here and there, but leather rules firm,
with an active demand. The settlement of the protracted labor
strike at Fall River is encouraging, and its effects will doubtless soon
be felt by the great milling interests of New England. The railroad
earnings continue to show an increase over corresponding periods
last year, but the increase is very small. No serious car shortages
are reported, and this- rather points to a diminished distribution of
general merchandise. I
The money market remains as before, tfie supply of funds being
enormous and rates of interest low. The situation in Wall street
is devoid of especial feature, the week having been uneventful in that
sensitive mart. Confidence in the future, however, continues undi
minished, and the general tone of the stock market is steady to firm,
with no particular tendency either up or down at the moment.
The conditions on the Pacific Coast are similar to those in other
parts of the country. Frequent and general rains continue to give
brilliant crop prospects, and the season is still ideal from the farm
er's point of view. Unless some serious climatic deficiency, such as
a dry spring, or hot north winds early in the summer, occurs, we shall
probably harvest large crops of everything this year. This most ex
cellent crop prospect imparts a feeling of buoyancy to the whole
coast, and everybody in trade, manufacturing, farming and financier
ing, is confident of another good year, jÂ§Jt
THE FACTS ANENT YOSEMITE.
THE CALL printed on Friday a communication from William j
H. Mills, one-time member of the Yosemite Valley Commission j
and one of the original promoters of the scheme for a national |
park, in which the mooted question of recession to the Federal Gov- j
ernment of the trusteeship held by California is given an illuminat
ing consideration. The facts stated by Mr. Mills, facts of law which !
suffer no sentimental interpretation, go far to clear up a deal of
popular misconception concerning the projected legislation.
The strong point which our correspondent would impress upon
his readers is that "recession" is used erroneously in connection with
the plan for allowing control of the valley to pass back to Federal '
administration. Yosemite cannot be re-ceded because it is not ours
to re-cede. In the confusion of sentimental argument that has arisen
over the proposed measure the central fact that California did not
receive Yosemite in fee, but was merely invested with a limited trus
teeship, is overlooked. "The right to pay the expense of its (the val
ley's) maintenance as a public recreation ground,* says Mr. Mills,
"was the only thing granted, and so apprehensive was the Govern
ment that even that trust might be abused that a limited lease right;
was attached as an irrevocable covenant."
When we learn definitely that in turning over Yosemite to the
government the State of California is giving up nothing but the ;
right to pay the expenses of its keeping, then the larger question of |
the expediency of the proposed move remains unhampered. Is it i
expedient that the State should continue to exercise control over the
Clefl of the Yosemite when the Fedral Govrnment administers the I
national park surrounding that particular spot? Does the divided!
jurisdiction of the whole tract, coupled with the fact of the State's
inability to make appropriations adequate for the complete exploita
tion of the valley's resources, make for the highest efficiency of the
mountain wonder garden as a public pleasure spot? The majority of i
California's civic bodies and outdoor clubs thinks not.
IT seems that this year is to be a record breaker in the way of na
tional conventions of various sorts to be held in California. It is
arranged that nine great delegated bodies will meet here. The
people of the East have had a taste of the convention weather and
scenery of this State and want more of it. They have also tried
California hospitality and like the brand.
We are not yet furnished with a list of the bodies that will com
bine business with recreation and pleasure here, but it is enough to
know that they are coming to California. That means that they are
composed of people of high intelligence, great good taste and the
best kind of common sense. California does not need to make any
special preparations for these visitors. This State is always swept
and garnished. It has no worst foot and so its best is always put
forward. From the mountain summits to the low water line of the
littoral California is always ready for company, and we can prosper
and do well while working with one hand and playing with the other,
whereas elsewhere both hands are kept busy in a short summer
storing things for a long winter. Nothing hibernates in this State;
even a bear does not suck his paws, but fattens through our almanac
winter on wild honey.
The coming conventions will bring many who will either stay or
come again, as soon as they can dispose of their ice ponds in the East,
and be of us. We need them and they need California for length of
days and life's enjoyment. This State keeps her contract with ail
comers, for her gifts and graces never fade and her glory is always
upon her. In a few years no one will think of holding a national con
vention of any importance elsewhere.
To the long record of cruelty in our treatment of the Indians is to be
added the starvation of the Northern Cheyennes through the ignorance of the
Indian Bureau as to the actual conditions at the reservation. Probably the
Indians should be self-supporting, but as a matter of fact they are not, and
they are without food and clothing. The agent at Rosebud supposed they
were working and prosperous and urged the cutting off of their supplies.
Doubtless it is a great bother to an agent to make a personal investigation
before taking so great a step, but sometimes there seems to be no way for an
official to escape work without causing somebody annoyance or suffering.â

HOW WEATHER
PREDICTIONS
ARE MADE
In the January World's Work there
is a very clear description of the
methods and principles involved in
making the weather forecasts Issued
daily by the United States Govern
ment.
Not the least valuable assistance the
Government renders mariners and
farmers is furnished in its weather
forecasts, four-fifths of which turn out
to be correct Indeed the record of
the Weather Bureau for the past five
years has been that no serious storm
has occurred that has not been pre
dicted sufficiently long - In advance for
all people whose interests are affected
by the weather to take due precau
tions. Daily at 8 o'clock in the morn
ing and at 8 o'clock in the evening by
Eastern time, observers at more than
200 stations in the United States,
Northern Mexico, Southern Canada
and the West Indies telegraph to map
making stations observations on every
detail of the weather, such as tem
perature, .humidity, the kind and the
direction of clouds and so on. At each
of these stations charts made from the
information in the reports are pre
pared for free distribution over the ad-
Joining district. In many places in the
West the weather forecast Is tele
phoned from central telephone sta
tions to all the farmers in the neigh
borhood.
The approximate accuracy of the
forecasts results from the fact that the
Government observers know how the
weather conditions move. Seven
tenths of our storms, for example, be
gin in the northwest, move southeast
and then curve north again over the
Great Lakes and disappear to the east j
down the St. Lawrence Valley, though j
the West India" hurricanes move first i
west and then northeast. The storms ,
are located by low barometic readings !
and by the direction of the windsâ j
which whirl about a storm center in
the opposite direction to that of mov- j
ing clock hands, sometimes spinning j
iround a circle a thousand miles In i
iiameter. To the east of the storm 1
blow 1 southerly moist winds which;
bring rain. To the west of the storm !
:ome winds from west or northwest ;
bringing colder weather. So by ex- i
perience the weather observers receiv- i
ing reports of the conditions at storm i
centers can predict from the rapidity j
if the movement from to east j
bow far a storm will advance in twelve '
sr twenty-four hours and what kind of ,
weather will result in every quarter of !
it. Predictions can thus be made two
ar three days In advance. And now |
the Government is building on Mount
Weather, Va., an observatory for >
sveather research. Efforts will be j
made there to establish forecasts of
whole seasons. 1

MEN HAVE
MORE REPOSE
THAN WOMEN
Much has been said and.written in
praiÃe of what is at once the rarest and
most characteristic of worn-
anklndâthe supreme quality of repose.
There are two varieties of reposeâ
one the simplest inertia which results
from stupidity; the other the product
of perfect balance, the equilibrium that
results from self perfectly controlled.
They are often impossible to distin
guish one from the other, and, because
of this difficulty, a man who admires
the serene type often finds himself
married to a woman whom he thought
personified it. only to discover that she
has the stupid immobility that results
from a mind too small for an' idea to
turn around in.
But even this is probably to be pre
ferred In a life association to the un
balanced nerves that so often mark the
more intellectual woman. For she is
apt to make a very small extra allow
ance of gray matter to apology for
every shortcoming under the sun and
to feel that a smattering of Greek or
Latin atones for the inability to make
a bed or cook a beefstake.
We are all more or less born f o re
pose. There is ribthing more placid un
der the sun than a perfectly healthy,
contented baby. But few of us are in
later life able to retain even a trace
of that serenity, deep and unmoved as
the surface of a woodland pool on a
mid-June afternoon.
There are some stoics who believe
that It is the part of the hero to meet
misfortune with a smile. But this
savors more or less of the theatrical,
and seems rather to be overdoing it.
To greet it calmly with the poise of a
well-balanced character that surveys
at once the extent of the disaster and
the possibilities of remedy, seems the
better part. And this only the quality
of repose will enable us to do.
Men have more repose than women*
Perhaps the superior endowment is not
a natural inheritance, but the result
of business training, and the systematic
forethought of good and evil fortune
(hat It entails.
Women fret and worry continually
where men haven't time to. And worry
is the death knell of repose.
To the beauty culturist pining for
adipose it should be mentioned that in
repose lies the supreme flesh food, and
that she who has taught herself im
munity'from trifling cares may become
a veritable Hebe without the aid of
gymnastics or special diet.
It may be that to be Just naturally
stupid is half the battle. But stupidity
is often the better part of feminine
valor, anyhow, and it yet remains to
be demonstrated that it is not as well
her choicest inheritance.âNixola Gree

THE MOON, MAKING AND MARRIAGE

fe* Fen mo bet-
enterprising psychologist who
has been studying youthful love
by the up-to-date method of the

there is a man In it. On the other
Jiand, men like the moon, it seems, be

that he was looking through glass

MISSED HIS HELP.
Doctor Pillsburyâl've been away
for a long time.
Waggsonâl thought so. *
Dr. PillsburyâWhy?
WaggsonâWell, I noticed where
Phantem, the undertaker, had failed.
In an old English chapbook is de
scribed one singular method of divina
tion which is full of moonshine. When
you go to bed in the season of the har
vest moon, it says, place under your
pillow a prayer book open at the part
of the marriage service, which reads,
"With this ring I thee wed"; place on
it a key, a ring, a flower and a sprig of
willow, a small heart cake, a crust of
bread and the following cards: The ten
of clubs, nine of hearts, ace of spades
and the ace of diamonds. Wrap all
these in a thin handkerchief and with
your head upon them say:
"Luna, every woman's friend.
To me thy goodness condescend;
Let me this night in vision see
Emblems of my distiny."
If you dream of storms trouble will
be your lot. If the storm ends in a calm
you may expect your fate to do like
wise. To dream of a ring or the ace of
diamonds signifies marriage. Bread is
the symbol of life; cake,
of a prosDerous life; flowers, of Joy;
willow, of treachery in love. ,
Spades mean death; diamonds,
money; clubs, a foreign land; hearts,
an unfortunate love affair; keys, that
you will rise to great trust and power
and never know want; birds, that you
will have a large family, and geese,
that you will marry more than once.
For myself, I would rather dream on
wedding cake. It is Just as sure a
charm and more satisfactory to the
palate afterward; besides, you don't
have to wait for the harvest moon.
There are other love customs asso
ciated with the moon which are really
pretty. All of them, however, are very
much alike. For instance, among the
Highland Scots and in some parts of
England the women curtsey to the new
moon, saying:
"All hail to .thee, moon, all hail to thee,
I prithee, good moon, declare to me
This night who shall my true love be."
The consensus of opinion appears to
be that the moon affects the hearts of
human beings as inexplicably and as
powerfully as it affects the tide. The
"spotless Dion" leading her "snowy
fawns" abroad has a subtler Influence
upon the destiny of mortals than the
splendid sun, who has the name of be
ing king of earth and sky. Thus, in
Liber Amoris, are their separate office*
distinguished, sings the moon song:
"Sunlight lures, like golden fleece,
Eastward; mine is westward, peace;
His a trumpet, mine a tabor, his for
labor,
Mine for love.**
woman may become a citizen of the
United States by naturalization, the
fact of her naturalization would not
make a citizen of her son if he were
born in a foreign country and the
father had never resided in the United
States, for section 1993 of the Fed
eral statutes says: "All children
heretofore born or hereafter born
out of the limits of the United States
whose fathers were or may be citizens
thereof at the time of their birth are
declared to be citizens of the United.
States; but the rights of citizenship
shall not descend to children whose
fathers never resided in the United
States." Under that section a man who
came to this country and was under
age at the time his mother was nat
uralized could not claim the right to
vote by virtue of parent's naturaliza
tion.
MILITARY SERVICEâB. T. T. C,
City. If a youth of 19 born In Germany
left his native country before he gave
his country the military service he is
required by law to give and came to
the United States and in due time be
came a citizen of that country and de
cided to return to bis native country,
he would be liable to be forced into
the army. The United States would
not Interfere, as the individual owed
the service to his country before he be
came a citizen. By an understanding
between Germany and the United
States, in time of peace, a native of
Germany who escaped military service
and became a citizen of the United
States is permitted to return to his na
tive country as a visitor, where he may
remain four months; should he remain
beyond that time he would be liable to
arrest and made to take his place in
the army.

TO BE BAGGED
Clubwomen Bcent "Practical Politics"
Federation Details Complete
"No suffrage for the women of Cali
fornia this year"âthus runs the "Ud"
from Sacramento. Yes, ladies of the
suffrage clubs, the men of the commit
tee to which your bill was referred are
"perfect gentlemen." They agreed
with every syllable in your resolution.
Long had they yearned for such oppor
tunity to prove to the world their chiv
alry, their sense of justice, their burn
ing desire to serve youl Far be it from
them to oppose one phrase of it, and
thus was there no opening for argu
ment. "Why argue, when the Jury
agrees," said the Solons.
So far, fine! Butâthe bill is now
scheduled to come before both houses
tree from objection, be put to a vote
âand killed. Yes, ladies, gagged,
bagged and flung over the fence by
unanimous agreement of both houses,
unless your lobbyists "get busy" and
scare some of those fellows into letting
the measure come before the electors.
After all the campaigning that has
. been done In the Interest of suffrage
this year it would be rather an igno
minious defeat to have the resolution
unanimously defeated.
â¢ The performances in Colorado this
year, and in Kansas for many years,
have dealt a heavy blow to equal suf
frageâto such as think with their
ears.
But such an argument is stupid! Are
men denied the privilege of franchise'
because some of their sex are stuffers,
bribers and otherwise unclean?
Then don't use the Colorado argu
ment. Be frank and admit yourself
prejudiced by honest old traditions.
But from the weather signs now fly
ing the word "female" will not be
ptrlcken out for the word "native" in
. the proposed constitutional amend
ment
So, ladles of the Suffrage Club, you'd
better get busy. And don't forget to
Sut on "your list" the fellows who don't
old to their word. But why suggest
such retribution?
Women with "measures" don't
usually harbor evanescent memories.

Another measure in which club
women all over the Stateâand the leg
islative committee of the California
Club (Mrs. Lovell White, chairman) in
particularâls interested is that relating
to the appointment of assistant women
physicians in the State hospitals for the
insane and the Home for Feeble-mind
ed Children.
The existing law provides for the ap
pointment of a woman physician in
hospitals for the insane where the
number of inmates warrants the em
ployment of a fourth assistant physi
cian. This law, passed in 1895, during
Governor Gage's administration, has
resulted in the employment of two
women physicians In the hospitals at
Napa and at Stockton.
Here In their trial positions, these
women have rendered noble service,
understanding the peculiar physical
defects of their charges as few men
can, and treating these conditions in
a'sane and scientific mannerâas few
men have done.
The results have been marvelous,
the partial and permanent cures
standing as Irrefutable proof of these
women's services to the wards of the
State and to the State itself.
Besides many of the unpleasant
stories that in the past have embar
rassed these institutions will have dis
appeared, should a woman physician
nave exclusive charge of women pa
tients.
The movement is humane, moral,
philanthropic and economic, and on
â¢these grounds the proposed amend
ment to the law should pass, espe
ciallyâplease note this, ye lawmak
' ers!âas it carries no appropriation.
And with that bugbear removed,
how could Governor Pardee veto it?
* * *
Federation! Federation! It's about
that charmed word that most of the
powwows are now being held. And
who's going? That is the question.
AH who are should ring up Mrs.
George Law Smith, 2226 Jackson
â¢street, as soon as their minds are
"made upâand made up for keepsâso
the rate of $15 may be definitely de
cided upon.
As stated in yesterday's issue, there
. must be sixty tickets sold in order
that the half-rate shall prevail. Oth
erwise the rate will be one and a
third.
. .From all indications there's going
.-to be a gay time down south, while
the convention lastsâFebruary 7, 8
and 9.
These folk of the southland never
do things by halves, and they assure

â¢ 'Tis said that with the usual degree
of Southern California enterprise, a
huge' number of new clubs have
sprung up in anticipation of the ap
proaching convention, which will give
to the southerners a sweeping ma
jority on the floor. One wonders
â¢whether these clubs are "mushrooms."
The amendments striking "wom
an's" from the official title of the
.State Federation will lead the hosts
together, but If the south stands solid
âand it usually does â'woman's"
goes out. Then, oh, then will the men
of the State rejoice, for the clubs will
swing wide their doors and bid them
enter. And then will t#a, instead of
highballs, become the club beverage.

WOMEN WHO CHARM
HEALTH IS THE FIRST ESSENTIAL
It Helps Women to Win and Hold
Men's Admiration, Respect and Lot*
Woman's greatest gift s the power to
inspire admiration, respect, and lore.
There is a beauty in health which is
more attractive to men than mere regu*
'arity of feature.
To be a successful wffe, to retain the
love and admiration of her husband,
should be a woman's constant study.
At the first indication of ill-health,
painful or irregular menstruation,
headache or backache, secure Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and
begin its use.
Mrs. Chas. F. Brown, Vice-President
Mothers' Club, 21 Cedar Terrace, Hot
Springs, Ark., writes;
Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â
" For nine years I dragged through a miser
able existence, suffering with inflammation
and falling of the womb, and worn out with
pain and weariness. I one day noticed a state
ment by a woman suffering as I was, but who
had been cured by Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg-.
etable Compound, and I determined to try it.
At the end of three months I was a different
woman. Every one remarked about it, and
my husband fell in love with me all over
again. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com
pound built up my entire system, cured the
womb trouble, and I felt like a new woman.
I am sure it will make every suffering woman
strong, well and happy, as it has me/
Women who are troubled with pain

ache, bloating* (or flatulence), leucor
rhoea, falling, inflammation or ulcera
tion of the uterus, ovarian troubles,

LICENSED SURVEYOR,
109 MONTGOMERY ST.
City Lot* Accurately and Officially Surveyed.
CHARGES REASONABLE.
My field books, diagrams show, by actual
measurements, the exact points from which
your lot was surveyed, which Is imperatively
necessary, as the City Surveyor and other sur
veyors do not show that, and also because all
the original monuments were taken out when
the streets were formed In the early days of
1 the city, since which time the different City
I Surveyors extending to the present time have
: made Innumerable errors in their street and
lot surveys, and to conceal such errors they
have moved the monument lines away from
their original correct positions without legal
authority from the people, causing blocks and
streets to measure incorrectly, creating excess
measurements in blocks of the most valuable
portion of the city, which they do not distribute
proportionately throughout the block, but often
give the entire excess of sometimes 12 inches
or more to one person, thereby Interfering with
the deed distances of the people and the abso
lute security of boundary lines.
Consult me before moving your valuable
buildings on such unfair surveys. Work guar
anteed.

MEDICINE ORE
OF MONTANA
Radiumite Which Is Found
in Mines Effects Cures.
Called Rheumatism Rock
MEN CARRY IT IN POCKET
Mineral Which, if Rubbed,
Emits Strange "Cold Fire,"
as It Is Denominated
Radlumite, the new designation giv
en to a strange mineral possessing- pe
culiar medicinal properties, is being
found in several of the large mines in
the neighborhood of Butte. Mont. For
years the diggers employed In the
Rarus and Lexington mines have been
aware of the presence of radlumite in
the workings and have become ac
quainted with one or two of ! its pe
culiarities.
They called It "medicine ore" and
"rheumatism rock" and have been In
the habit of carrying bits of it In their
pockets at all times. They believe it
Is a sure cure for "miners' consump
tion," rheumatism, stomach ailments,
kidney disease and various nervous
disorders.
Although the miners themselves
have had implicit faith In the healing
properties of the ore for many years,
Butte doctors and the public generally
simply regarded it as a superstition,
j placing the radlumite on a plane with
the buckeye and the rheumatism ring.
! Since the discovery of radium and the
j tracing of a relationship between it
and radlumite scientists and others
have been able to account for the
curative properties of Montana's
"medicine stones."
EMITS A COLD FIRE
The Butte medicine ore possesses
the strange quality of emitting a bril
liant light under slight friction by
some metallic substance, or even with
a finger nail. The light Is called a
"cold fire," because there la ab
solutely no heat to It, and its dis
| plays are more brilliant under water
than out of it. No value has ever been
found in the ore by mining men and
the only good it has served has been
as a talisman for the miners, who be
lieve In its curative virtues, and as
specimens for mineral cabinets, for
which it was much sought and often
commanded very high prices.
I While the Paris scientists were mak
ing their wonderful experiments with
radium it occurred to a Rarus miner
that the little lumps of "medicine ore"
might contain the rare element discov
ered by the Curries and In that way
account for the cures and the faith of
the miners. He spoke to several Butte
chemists about it and they took suffi
cient interest in the matter to make a
careful analysis and many tests of the
ore. But aside from satisfying them
selves that it possessed a trace of
radio-activity, they could not account
for the strange properties of the min
eral In other respects.
ARE SENT TO PARIS.
Finally specimens of the ore were
sent to Paris and other great labora
tories, but while reports were being
awaited from them Dr. G. D. Bryant
of Butte became Interested In the story
of the miner and he conducted a series
of experiments along an entirely differ
ent line, prompted only by curiosity.
He wondered if there was any basis
for the belief of the miners that the
j "medicine ore" could cure anything
| and he began an investigation of a
i number of reported cures. Almost
without exception, as he found, men
and women who carried the mineral
claimed to have derived benefits from
| it and could not be ridiculed out of the
idea that it was a curative as well as
a preventive. Then he made tests on
patients of his own, with results that
puzzled and astonished him. if they did
not convince him. He made a report
of his investigations and conclusions
to his fellow physicians and then the
story of radlumite created a sensation-
Since then doctors and scientists from
all parts of the world have taken an
Interest in It, and many have visited
Butte to Investigate for themselves.
The people of Butte are beginning to
take an extraordinary interest In the
search for the new medicine. Miners I
have.given up positions to search for
the o*e. and superintendents are be
sieged with applicants for jobs. Sick
and decrepit men beg permission to
work where the medicine ore Is depos
ited.âChicago Chronicle.
Woman's Education in Tipping.
The tip, once expected only by ser
vants and those who performed some
special or unusual service, has made
Its way steadily in the favor of all
sorts and conditions of employes, until
in New York the gratuity account
must be loked on as a regular item
of the household expenses. The house
wife who would have her cut of beef
trimmed to her liking must fee the
butcher. The green grocer's clerk
exacts his tribute by providing the
choicest of his wares for those most
liberal in their treatment of him.
That householder who jiever neglects
to leave a coin for thejceman receives
full weight, prompt service and does
not have to renew the llnlng of the re
frigerator too often. Historically,
women are not liberal dispensers of
tips. But as the system of demanding
and extorting gratuities extends, they
are being educated to a point of equal
ity with their men folks, who have
long recognized the hopelessness of en
deavoring to escape the toils of the
tip. Once, woman regarded it as her
right and privilege to leave the res
taurant waiter unrewarded. Now, in
her own sacred preserves, she finds it
necessary to open the purse that she
rtnay have an opportunity to select the
goods she wishes to buy. The time
may come when woman will acknowl
edge the claim of the waiter.âNew

FERTILE MANCHURIA
RECALLS HOME SCENES
Crop Covered Landscape Resemble*
What May Be Seen in Northern
Part of Our Country.
This is distinctly a human countryâ
a country of cornfields, beans and po
tatoes, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs,
goats .and no freaks in tree trunk,
branch or foliage. But I can't get over
seeing a Chinaman in a cornfield. It
is always a shock. He doesn't seem to
have any right there âsomehow, no
body does except a whit% man or a
darky. There are tumble bugs in the
dusty road, and gray, flying grasshop
perlike things that rise from the dust,
flutter a few feet from the earth and
drop back again, just as they do at
home. And the dragon fliesâwhy, they
are nothing in the world but the "snake
doctors" that I used to throw stones at
when I was a boy in the Bluesrrass.
The mountains are treeless and vol
canic, but it's a human country, and I
don't feel as far from home as I did
in Japan. Brill says it all looks like a
lot of Montana hills around Ohio corn
fields, only the corn Is millet that stows
twelve feet high. The people eat the
top, they feed the blades to livestock,
and the stalk serves almost every pur
pose of bamboo and for firewood as
well. You can ride for hours between
two solid walls of it, and you wonder
how there can be people in the scat
tering villages to plant and till or even
cut it. A richer land I never saw. It
looks as though it would feed both
armies, and yet there was no signâno
burned house or robbed field, or even a
castoff bit of the soldier's equipment to
show that an army had ever passed
that way. One fact only spoke signifi
cantly of war. No womanâexcept a
child or a croneâwas ever visible. This
struck me, when I recalled the trail of
the Massachusetts volunteers from
Slboney to Santiago and the thousands
of women refugees straggling into
Caneyâas very remarkable. I suppose
both Japanese and Russians are trying
to keep the good will of the Chinaman
as well as of fhe rest of the world. I
don't wonder that the Russians are
fighting for that land, nor shall I won
der should the Japanese, if they win.
try to keep it. But how it should be
long to anybody but the Chinaman
who has tilled it In peace and with no
harm to' anybody for thousands of
years. I can't for the life of me see.â

OLYMPIC CLUB PLAYER
WINS A HANDBALL MATCH
Henry Cory Easily Defeats Al Collins
on the Court of the St.
Ignatius Club. â¢
The interclub handball tournament
for the artistic silver cup offered by
the Pacific Amateur Association, drew
a big crowd to the St. Ignatius Athletic
Club's court yesterday afternoon.
Henry Cory, the Olympic Giyb crack,
easily beat Al Collins. Score, z\ to
28 Charley Wilgus was substituted
for J. Cashman and created a big sur
prise by easily beating Louis Levy.
Levy played hard, but could not get
on to .he left-hand playing of his
clever opponent. Score, 51 to 32.
Leach beat Canavan In an interesting
exhibition. On next Wednesday night
four games will be played at the Olym
pic Club. Cory plays Canavan and
Levy plays Skelly. So far the Olympic
Club has won tlx games, Occidental
four and St Ignatius two. Thirty-two
games are to be played before the
tournament is completed and each
player must compete in eight games.
Company Relays Curve.
The United Railroads began the
work of relaying the curve at Post and
Kearny street late last night. The
workmen were stopped by the police,
but were allowed to proceed when a
permit from the Board of Public
Works was displayed. Commissioner
Aigeltinger issued the permit 'last
Wednesday, when a representative of
the company appeared and said it had
agreed to lay the tracks fourteen
Inches farther from the curbing than
heretofore and that the property-own
ers, had consented to the plan.
Eddie Graney Wins on Points.
The quarrel between Jimmy Britt
and the proprietors of the Belvedere
Music Hall is still on. The latest de
velopment of the affair took the shape
of a personal encounter between At
torney Greely, who represents Britt,
and Eddie Graney. The latter won
on points, which included a knock
down.
There are hints that if the case goes
to trial there will be some unpleas
ant disclosures regarding the Brltt-
Gans affair.

FIRE FRIGHTENS
HOTEL GUESTS
Flames Attack Nadeau in
Los Angeles and Force
Roomers to Flee for Safety
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22.âOne hun
dred and fifty guests were routed from
their rooms and property valued at
probably $10,000 was destroyed by fire
at the Hotel Nadeau to-night The
fire started in a moving picture ma
chine in an amusement place upon the
first floor of the hotel, and the guests,
most of whom had retired, were forced
to flee in scant clothing. Mrs. H. C.
Jagger, wife of a . San Francisco
traveling man, was the only guest who
had difficulty In escaping. She is an in
valid and occupied a room on the
fourth floor. Other guests assisted her
to the street, slightly overcome by
smoke.
The fire spread to stores on the first
floor of the hotel building and was
gaining headway on the second floor
when extinguished.
YASHIMA IS SAVED.
Japanese Battleship Repaired and Her
Guns Remounted.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 22.âWith
the arrival to-day of the steamship
Athenian comes news in reference to
the reported loss of the Japanese bat
tleship Yashima, the Yorodzu of Tokio
reporting that the battleship was
saved and has been repaired. Her
guns have been remounted. The Kobe
Herald says a new vessel is about to
be huilt for the Japanese navy to re
place one of those lost at Port Arthur.
The same vessel brought news that
serious riots are reported to have oc
cured at Seoul.
London's Emergency Service.
London is curiously behind New York
in the matter of its emergency accident
service. None of the hospitals there,
incredible as It may seem, have ambu
lances such as are used here. Injured
persons are carried to the hospitals in
two-wheeled handbarrows propelled by
one or two policemen. There are only
two or three horse ambulances in the
city and they are private. There is an
agitation now for the introduction of
such vehicles into the hospital service.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1905.
NEIL'S TRAINING
IS STRENUOUS
Tiny Boxer Goes at His
Work as Though the Fate
of a Kingdom Hung on It
IS BUNDLE OF NERVES
Bouts "in Practice With
Young Corbett Are Mar
vels of King Bealisni
Despite the heavy downpour a large
crowd visited Boxer Frankie Neil at
his training quarters, near San Rafael,
yesterday and saw him go through his
training work. .The most exciting
item on the card was a three-round
bout with Young Corbett.
Neil ia so full of fight that he never
thinks of boxing, so all kinds of ex
citement and ring realism were
thrown into the bout. Neil is a bundle
of nervous energy and there Is a zip
and a sting to his blows that are not
looked for in a boxer of his Inches.
Corbett is such a willing boxer that
the pair put up a sensational bout.
Neil has speed and class over Dick Hy
land, his next opponent, which the
latter expects to offset with strength
and hitting power.
Neil is still of spidery build, but his
muscles are like tempered steel. He Is
putting on a little weight at San Ra
fael and expects to scale 117 pounds
on the day of his fight. This will give
Hyland an advantage of nearly five
pounds, as the agreed weight is 122
pounds.
Neil will have no excuses to offer on
the score of condition, as Frank Mc-
Donald is giving him every attention.
It seems almost assured that Young
Corbett and Battling Nelson will meet
before the Hayes Valley Club next
month. Both men are holding out for
a return match with Britt, but that
astute young man has an easier and a
more remunerative fight in view. He
wants Jabez White, whose last Im
portant fight was with Spike Sullivan,
whom he defeated in fifteen rounds in
June, 1902. As this was two and a half
years ago it is not likely he is up to
the present bruising style of milling.
With Brltt out of the way, It Is ex
pected Nelson and Corbett will have
no difficulty in reaching an understand
ing. Corbett has been at Billy Shan
non's, near San Rafael, for several
weeks building up his health. He has
gone through his regular exercise, but
with 110 thought of actual training. He
lives temperately, his only relaxation
being a visit to the theater in this city
once each week. From appearances he
will be in better condition than at any
previous time he has fought here. That
he is still a favorite with the ring pa
trons Is shown by the enthusiastic re
ception he is given whenever he is a
spectator at a tight. The climate of
Marin County agrees with him and the
weight comes off easily. He always
had trouble in this respect at the beach,
the hardest work yielding but small
results.
FAMOUS STATUE
TO BE MOVED
That of Charles I in the
English Metropolis Must
Give Up Its Old Position
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 22.âThat surviving
remnant of the long lost Jacobite cause,
the Legitimist Society, views with dis
may the prospect of the removal of the
equestrian statue of King Charles I
from the conspicuous position it has
occupied at Charing Cross. Still cher
ishing the hope that one of his de
scendants may some day oust from the
throne the representative of the reign
ing dynasty, they are wont publicly to
testify to their faith and devotion by
decorating'the statue of the "martyred
King," as they fondly call him, on the
anniversary of his execution. The con
temptuous tolerance with which his
Majesty regards such proceedings is
shown by the fact that the annual cere
mony takes place under the supervision
of an agent of the crown.
Standing In close proximity to the
famous Trafalgar Square, the statue
has long been a familiar one to Ameri
can visitors ,to London. Its removal
will probably be rendered necessary to
make room for the entrance of the
new Mall from Charing Cross. The
question of finding a new site for it is
under consideration. In these demo
cratic days few Englishmen really
cherish any regard for the memory of
the monarch whom stout Oliver Crom
well beheaded, and they care little
what disposition is made of his statue.
The part he played in English his
tory, it is felt, does not entitle him to
a position so near the towering Nelson
monument and the effigies of other
heroes grouped about the square.
It would not be the first time that
the statue has been shifted. After the
King had lost his head the Common
wealth Government sold the statue to
a Holborn brazier named Rivers, with
the understanding that it should be
broken up. Rivers was a thrifty fel
low with a talent for turning things to
account. Foreseeing that a time might
come when the monarchical party
would again be in the ascendancy and
the statue would be worth considerable
money, he carefully buried it. Then he
set to work and manufactured a lot of
knives and forks with bronze handles,
which he declared had been made from
the statue. For these he found ready
purchasers at good prices among both
Puritans and Cavaliers.
When the monarchy was restored
the wily brazier saw tho chance for
which he had been waiting. He dug
up the statue and offered to sell It
back to the Government at a large
profit. The offer was accepted and the
statue was placed In Its present posi
tion in 1674.
It was said that the sculptor com
mitted sluiced when it was pointed out
to him that he had forgotten to put
saddle girths on the King's horse.
With the view of ascertaining the
proportion of foreign gold coin, com
pared with the French, the director of
the French mint requested the Bank of
France to obtain 50,000 pieces from the
tills of different branches in the prov
inces. An examination of that coin
showed that 41,583 were French and 8417
foreign, the latter representing nearly
17 per cent. The alien gold was princi
pally Belgian, Italian, Autro-Hungar
ian, Swiss, Russian, Greek, Spanish,
etc.
HIGH SCORES PREVAIL
DESPITE POOR LIGHT
August Jungblut, a Veteran Marksman,
in Great Form at Shell Mound,
Th#re were a number of rifle enthu
siasts at Shell Mound Park yesterday,
although the weather was against good
marksmanship. At many times during
the day the rain and darkness made it
almost impossible for the riflemen to
align their sights. Some remarkable
shooting was done by the members of
the San Francisco Schuetzen Verein in
the competition shoot. August Jung
blut, a veteran enthusiast, made 71
and 70 rings out of a possible 75, and
was heartily applauded by his com
rades. Although there were, but twelve
competitors in this contest, seven
members n)ade 70 or over and four
made more than 68, # an exceptionally
line average even *in the best of
weather. Fred Brandt and Herman
Huber tied on 69 and 71 rings each,
giving A. Jungblut a close call for the
honors.
In the bullseye contests of the day
Louis Bendel of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein was high man among
his comrades with 148 points. Henry
Bach of the Red Men's Schuetzen Com
pany was the lucky winner of the
Captain Siebe medal on the bullseye
target, with 218 points to his credit H.
Bornholdt of the Germania Club was
high, with 306.
The veterans of the National Guard,
who started In yesterday for regular
monthly competitions, were disap
pointed by the unfavorable weather
and did not make the high scores an
ticipated, although a number of crack
shots are among the members.
William Garms, the veteran marks
man, has given a gold medal to the
Shell Mound Club, to be competed for
during the year. The trophy is Jo be
awarded to the rifleman making the
best three bullseyes during the year.
Captain L. Slebe has also contributed
a gold medal, to be competed for by
the highest three men In each class.

CAIRNS TO BOX
CLEVER POWELL
Will Meet to Decide Posses
sion of the So Called
Amateur Championship
Bob Cairns, the boxer, will strive to
take the so-called amateur lightweight
championship title from Lew Powell
when they meet In Woodward's Pa
vilion next Friday night before the
Hawthorne Club. Cairns is accused of
having dodged a meeting with Mike
Synfy last Friday night. He says he
sustained an injury to his shoulder
some days since. Knowing he had to
take on Powell he preferred to skip
Synfy, whom he had already beaten,
and be in perfect shape for the more
important match.
Another good bout will be between
"Rough House" McDonald and Frank
Mayfield. These two are sluggers and
should make things lively while in the
ring. There will be two special events
in the bantam class. Harry Tenny
meets Frank Edwards, while Harry
Baker meets Eddie Kehoe. The winner
of the last bout will be matched to
fight George Finnlgan for the bantam
championship. George Curran and
Young Dempsey will battle again. Last
week the pair met and Dempsey gained
a close decision. Willie Wolff and
Charlie Dunn, two hard hitters, will
also perform. The programme will open
with Pete Sullivan and Jack Keegan.
Eddie Smith will referee the bouts.
The proceeds will be devoted to buying
new apparatus and repairing the pres
ent quarters of the club.
ST. MARK'S CATHEDRAL
TO BE FULLY REPAIRED
Famous Edifice in Venice Will Be
Given Another Thousand-
Year Lease fef Life.
VENICE, Jan. 22. âTo thousands of
Americans who have visited Venice,
and that vastly greater number whom
books and pictures have made fami
liar with its beauties, the tidings that
St. Mark's âthe crowning glory of the
bridal city of the Adriaticâwas in
danger of collapse, must have caused
deep regret. It is pleasant, therefore,
to be able to convey the assurance,
obtained by personal interview with
the municipal authorities, that im
mediate steps will be taken to avert
what would be a catastrophe not only
for Venice or Italy, but for the whole
world.
The work of restoration and repair is
to be done in the most thorough fash
ion, while preserving intact the artistic
and antique value of the walls and
decorations. Attention will first be di
rected to strengthening the vaults and
foundations which have subsided Under
the tremendous weight they have to
sustain. The roof that now weighs so
heavily upon them is to be raised and
the large internal pillars which support
them will be strengthened. There will
be no more tinkering at restoration by
patching up the worst places. The en
tire building will be taken in hand and
; given such an overhauling as will give
I the old church a reasonable guarantee
j of another thousand years lease of life.
It will cost a lot of money, but to in
sure the safety of St. Mark's. Venice
will rally as one man. and if outside
assistance be needed Italy will sun
ply it.
Cornelius Vanderbilt Soldiering.
Lieutenant Cornelius Vanderbilt Is
very popular in the Twelfth Regiment
by reason of his democratic ways and
the spirit he displays in his relations
with the enlisted men. He particularly
earned the approbation of the un
striped men of his command in the rev
! cent maneuvers at Manassas. On the
j march back from Wellington on the
third day of the maneuvers, when it
was go as you please, one of the mem
bers of his company caught up with
Lieutenant Vanderbilt, who was well
to the front. All the National Guards
men were pretty well played out, men
and officers alike, by the march to
Wellington and the sham battle. "Well.
Lieutenant, how do you feel?" asked
the private. "I feel like 30 cents," re
plied Lieutenant Vanderbilt, "and
that's pr-Jtty cheap for a Vanderbilt."
The private and some boon com
panions had commandeered a keg of
cider at a roadside store, and his can
teen was filled with the liquid. "Here,
have a swig of this," said the private.
With the strap still around the pri
vate's shoulders Lieutenant Vander
bilt stopped and tilted the canteen to
his lips. "Better than any champagne
I ever drank." he said when the
. gurgling ceased. âNew York Tribune.

BOLL-FIGHTER
WILL PERFORM
Senor Robles to Illustrate
the Spanish Pastime in
Woodward's Pavilion Ring
Senor Enrico Robles, the Spanish bull
fighter, will give an exhibition of the
sport of Spain on Wednesday night in
Woodward's Pavilion. All brutal features
have been eliminated and the fair sex
can see the daring toreador in action.
The floor of the spacious pavilion will
be covered with tanbark and a fence
six feet high will inclose the beasts.
Two bulls brought from Butchertown
will be used in the exhibition. In order
to get the animals to the pavilion six
vaqueros have been engaged, and they
will drive the beasts to the inclosure in
the early hours of to-morrow morning.
Robles has had a new costume made
for the exhibition. It is of blue and
gold and cost $250. Robles has been
fighting bulls for fourteen years. He
has been gored a number of times and
bears marks on his head and body
from attacks by the animals. He is 29
years of age and weighs 190 pounds. He
has been training for this occasion and
will enter the arena In good condition.
He is agile and will show the specta
tors how simple it Is for an expert to
sidestep a rushing bull. He has given
exhibitions of his prowess throughout
the United States and has been highly
praised for his daring and clever work.
EMINENT JUDGE
PUT ON TRIAL
Prominent Englishman Is
Made to Submit to Author
ity of Small Police Court
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 22.âSeldom has there
been a more striking reversal of things
judicial than that presented by the ex
traordinary spectacle of one of the most
eminent, experienced and respected
of English judges on trial In a rural
police court, charged with breaking the
law which he has so long ably admin
istered.
Sir William Grantham is accused of
violating the building enactments of an
Inconspicuous country council by out
raging their dignity and setting their
powers at defiance by persisting In the
erection of cottages on his estate after
they had refustfÃ to pass his plans. The
legal drama abounds In elements of
Gllbertian humor, which might well
furnish material for a companion comic
opera to the "Trial by Jury."
Its farcical elements have been re
lieved by a touch of genuine pathos.
At one stage of the proceedings the
venerable Judge, overcome by the
sense'of th# indignity thrust upon him,
and the ingratitude shown him by his
neighbors, gave way to sobs and tears.
Sir William Grantham is now verg
ing on 3 severity. He has been eighteen
years on the bench. Prior to that for
many years he had an extensive prac
tice at the bar. Both as a lawyer and
a Judge he has had much to do with
cases involving disputes concerning
buildings, plans and architectural de
tails. On such matters he ranks* hitch
as a legal expert.
He inherited a country estate at
Barecombe, in Sussex, where he has
played the role of a benevolent land
ed proprietor for half a century.
During that period he has expended
over $200,000 in building construction
and improvements.
Among his tenants he is regarded
as a model landlord. One of his hob
bies Is the erection of cheap but com*
modious and healthy cottages for
workingmen on his property.
That in a matter at .present engaging
much attention In England among en
lightened men who recognize the evils
of over-crowding in the big cities and
are striving to make it possible for a
larger proportion of the laboring
classes to dwell in the country.
Sir William drew up the plans and
designs for a number of these cottages
himself. As required by law he sub
mitted them for approval to the collec
tive wisdom of the Challey Rural Dls
FOUR STAKES
ARE DECIDED
Freeport, Foxhunter, Quita
and Reckless Acrobat Are
Winners at Ingleside Park
FAVORITES HAVE A DAY
Trials Are Closely Contest
ed but the Talent Finds
No Trouble in Cashing
Four stakes were decided yesterday
at Ingleside Coursing Park. The class
and reserve events left unfinished from
last Sunday were captured by Quita
and Reckless Acrobat respectively.
Foxhunter defeated Wild Turkey in
the deciding course of the 40-dog re
serve stake, while Freeport won the
flag from Friendless Boy in the final of
the class stake.
The coursing during the day was of
the highest order despite the unfavor
able weather conditions. The betting
was unusually brisk during the day.
The dogs were evenly matched but the
talent seemed to have no trouble in
picking winners and the shortenders
fared badly.
The deciding course of the day proved
an exciting one. Freeport showed sev
eral lengths of speed over Friendless
Boy and scored many points before the
Boy got in the running. The hare was
a strong one and carried them over the
time limit. Friendless Boy was run
ning over the favorite at the end. The
hare spoiled the chances of Friendless
Boy by making his escape.
Foxhunter was made a 5 to 1 favorite
over Wild Turkey and scored after a
close run. Quita defeated Carlow Boy
in an unsatisfactory trial. Through the
favor of the hare the latter got the
turn a*hd made a quick kill. Reckless
Acrobat showed more speed than old
Sacramento Boy. Although the latter
was favored by the hare, he was not
able to beat the red dog. The following
are the day's results in detail:

FOLK WILL SHUT DOWN
ST. LOUIS WINE ROOMS
Governor Also Orders Action Taken at
Once Against Gambling
Resorts.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Jan. 22.â
"Wine rooms and gambling resorts
must be closed in St. Louis."
This is the emphatic statement made
by Governor Folk. Instructions al
ready have gone forward to Chief
Kiely ordering him to begin immedi
ately the work of reform. Â« The Gov
ernor's Instructions are plain. No
matter by whom the places are run,
he says, no influence must be allowed,
personal or otherwise, to interfere
with their closing.
Flights of the Albatross.
Of all the strange creatures seen by
travelers not the least Interesting Is
the wandering albatross. This great,
feathered wanderer, sometimes measur
ing seventeen feet from tip to tip of his
wings, will follow a ship for days at a
time. Some travelers and sailors de
clare that they have seen a particular
bird fly for weeks at a time without
resting. The albatross has always been
a bird of mystery, and In ancient times
the people believed that these un
wearying seabirds were the companions
of the Greek warrior Diomedes, who
were said to have been changed Into
birds at the death of their chief.
Though the superstition about the
killing of an albatross bringing bad
luck Is only a foolish one, it has served
a useful purpose for many years In pre
venting the slaughter of these beauti
ful and gallant birdsâthe Bailors'
friends and the landsmen's wonder. Up
in dreary Kamschatka, that outlying
part of Siberia which cuts into the
North Pacific, the natives, never hav
ing heard of the superstition about the
albatross, catch him and eat him. But
his flesh makes such poor food that,
after all, the legend may be said to
hold good, for he is indeed in bad luck
who has to make a meal of it.âOttawa
Free Press.
trict CounciL Included in that august
body are ten farmers, two retired
clergymen and two retired tradesmen.
The plans were unintelligible to
them and were held up. Sir William,
however, decided that he would pro
ceed with the erection of the cottages'
On his estate were several similar ones,
already occupied, which had proved
thoroughly san tary and in every re
spect satisfactory.
The Rural Council held several
meetings to consider the matter. If
the cottages were completed they
would afford standing proof of their
own incapacity. Besides it behooved
them to maintain their dignity and
authority. They decided to prosecute
the Judge.

OCCIDENTALS FORFEIT
Refuse to Meet the Independ
ents at Freeman's Park
Because of Muddy Ground
The inclement weather put a damper
yesterday on the ardor of the Associa
tion footballers. The match between
the Independent and Occidental teams,
which was to have taken place at Free
man's Park, Golden Gate, and was ex
pected to prove a fast game, was for
feited, the Occidentals refusing to play
on the wet ground. The Independents
kicked one goal and took the two
points for the match. The Independ
ents then made up sides and played a
practice game.
At Idora Park, Oakland, the game
between the Oakland Hornets atod Al
bion Rovers was postponed, the referee
considering the ground too heavy and
rain-soaked for play.
On the cricket ground at Webster
street, Alameda, the Eagles and Pick
wicks were scheduled to appear in a
match for the championship of the
California Association Football League.
The league match was postponed and
a practice game was played. Lancas
ter, Killinger and one or two Eagles
went home, while W. T. Bowcock and
Kirvin of the Pickwicks played for the
Eagles. In the first period the Pick
wicks and Eagles obtained two goals
each. In the second period the Pick
wicks obtained another goal, and the
score at the finish was: Pickwicks, 3
goals; Eagles, 2 goals. The teams oc

LORD CURZON REBUKED
BY HIS AIDE-DE-CAMP
Incident That Reveals 111 Feeling Be
tween Viceroy and His
Brother-in-lJiw.
LONDON, Jan. 22 âIf Lord Curzon '
had had his way it is doubtful wheth
er his aide-de-camp, the Earl of Suf
folk, would have married Miss Daisy
Letter. The Earl is a man of a most
independent nature, and it is well
known that such men cannot get en
comfortably with the Indian Viceroy.
The autocratic manner of Lord Cur
zon never ruffled the Earl, and when
others shook and shivered at the
sound,-pf his voice his aide would View
his most violent outbursts with the
utmost complacency.
One day they were on a bear hunt
ing expedition in India, and after a
fruitless search for nearly a whole
day were on the point of returning
home when Lord Curzon espied a
young animal crouching behind a tree.
Now the etiquette of bear hunting in
India requires that the animals should
be dispatched with a special kind of
dagger. On seeing the young bear,
however. Lord Curzon lifted his rifle
and shot the animal dead.
"That's a cowardly thing to do!"
angrily shouted the Earl; "you ought
to know that sportsmen do not use
their rifles on bears except in cases of
exceptional emergency."
Lord Curzon, red with rage, walked
rapidly up to the Earl and, standing
face to face with him, demanded an in
stant apology. "Do you dare call me
a coward?" roared the Viceroy.
"You are not playing the game,"
quietly responded the Earl, and with
that Lord Curzon turned around, left
the party and went home alone. Every
body thought that Lord Suffolk was
going to be cashiered, but It afterward
transpired that Lady Curzon had a
high opinion of the Earl and that It
was she who was really responsible for
retaining him on the Viceroy's staff.
Boers Still Fighting.
Commandant Jan Louw, the Boer of
ficer who refused to lay down his arms
when his fellow country mea surren
dered to the British and who fled to the
Longberg Mountains, on the borders of
German West Africa, with his band of
burgher fighters, has been successfully
resisting the combined English and
German forces in South Africa for
more than two years. In June, 1902,
when the Boer army capitulated, Louw
fled with only about 300 men. Within
the first year, however, this number
was increased to 2000, and to-day he is
said to have a combined force of 8000
sturdy warriors under his command.
Many Boers still believe that their
country can be reclaimed and many of
them look to Louw as the man who will
start the next rebellion. There exists
an understanding among Boers and
their sympathizers that the next upris
ing will be in 1906, and it is also stated
that 16,000 men have agreed to respond
to the commandant's call.âChicago
Chronicle.

FIVE WALTZERS
NEED PATCHING
Question as to Etiquette Is
Cause of Eow at Social
Affair in the Pavilion
â¢ A simple question of etiquette at Mc
â¢ Ginnis' ball Saturday night made one
section of the Mechanics' Pavilion look
like a riot at St. Petersburg. Five of
the casualties were patched up later at
. the Central Emergency Hospital.
During the lull between the waltz and
the deux temps Charles Gay politely
asked a lady with maroon hair. "Will
youse crawl the next dance with me.
kiddo? '
"Aw, you take a running jump at
yourself," replied the lady.
"You've got a front to ask a rag: to
crawl with you without getting; a
knockdown," remarked the damsel's es
cort, W. Bulger.
Gay quietly drained the beer mue he
was holding and brought it down on
Bulger's head. Bulger grabbed a chair
and fractured three of. its runes on
Gay's cranium. In the scuffle the pair
upset a lady who was conversing: with
Frank Edwards and Charles Creely.
Frank and Charles fell upon the strug
gling pair and the quartet rolled across
the ballroom floor.
The band struck up "Good by. My
Bluebell." "Clear the floor!" yelled the
manager. "The next dance is on."
Twenty revelers fell upon the quartet
with Deer mugs and more flew to their
â¢ aid. For a while the rule was "punch
.every face you don't know." When the
police cleared the floor, the following:
casualties were discovered:
Charles Gay, lacerated wounds of the
â calp. *
W. Bulger, lacerated wounds of the
scalp.
Charles Creely, upper and lower lips
slit
Frank Edwards, knife wound In the
Bide.
Dr. I. A. McGough, contusion of the
head.
The doctor, who was hovering: on the
â¢ edge of the scrimmage to lend first aid
to the injured, became entangled In the
whirl of flying flsts and was floored.
While the medico was down and out
somebody separated him from $15. The

SENDS A SHOT
INTO CANTEEN
Brawling and Murder Are in
Beer Sold in Beservations,
Says Bey. J. H. N. Willkms
"Shall we have the canteen within
and saloons without the Presidio
gates?" asked the Rev. James H. N.
Williams yesterday in an address at
Simpson Memorial Methodist Episco
pal Church. In answering the ques
tion in the negative Mr. Williams said:
There U drunkenness and brawling and
murder in canteen beer as in beer sold out
side of Government reservations. We charge
the canteen with being the place where appe
tites for stronger liquors were formed and de
veloped and that light wines and mild beers
cultivate a taste that later often call for the
stronger drinks.
Advocates of the canteen leave the Inference
that its abolition is the cause for Increased
desertions from the army, at least in a
greater degree than any other cause. But
this will not bear close examination. It is
true that our army is the best paid, best fed,
beat clothed and best sheltered army in the
world. And yet nine out of .ten of our saldiers
deserted last year. Harper's Weekly, seeking
to account for this large per cent of deser
tlons. recently gave a number of reasons,
among them being non-attraction of military
service in the time of peace, low wages, neces.
sary restriction of liberty, prevention from
getting ahead in the world. In ability to
marry and make a home and deprivation of
"moderate solace in post exchange beer."
If great corporations and railroad companies
employing large numbers of men prohibit
liquor drinking among their employes on the
ground of safety, economy and the welfare of
the men themslves, ought not the Government
to have an equal interest in the men who
wear its uniform? When the Government has
taken away the canteen from within the gates
can a self-respecting city government con
tinue to license saloons at the gates to entice
and corrupt the soldiers? Surely not. And so
we say. "No canteen within the gates and no
yawning saloons without." The fair name of
the city Is surely injured in the esteeem of
every visitor to the Presidio who must reach
Its main entrance through a street lined with
saloons. Every good citizen desiring the wel
fare of the soldier and appreciative of every
effort In his behalf will Indorse the work of
Major General Mac Arthur, who Is seeking to
banish these dives and brothels that cluster a:
the gates of the Presidio.
Here Is one of the finest military reserva
tions and posts in all the country, with a pros
pect of its ei.largment and improvement. But
if our city government takes no steps to clone
up those hell holes, and our citizens In general
are Indifferent to the disgraceful menace, can
we expect the national Government to spend
its money in enlarging and in beautifying the
grounds'?
The liquor power has long enough held San
Francisco by the throat and controlled Its pub
lic affairs. Something needs to be done of a
very vigorous kind, not only at the gates of the
Presidio, but In other parts of the city. A raid
now and then in Chinatown and In some
brothel alley or dive is a very puerile and
farcical aftair. From headquarters out to the
farthest point that Is reached by city power
and authority we need government that stands
for all that is clean and wholesome, and that
Is the recognized enemy of all evil-doers who
can neither expect nor find protection or con
nivance in their wicked ways. That la not to
be looked for under the present administration
We need, first of all, a Mayor with moiai
conviction and Influence, who will gather about
him men of like feeling and purpose; who can
be relied upon to lead In moral reforms and to
put down graft until our city shall have a name
that Is as fair as her situation Is beautiful and
commercially advantageous.
Then no three thousand saloons will act as
highwaymen In the city's midst, and no pen
will be defiled In a Mayor's hand by signing
an ordinance that licenses such a monstrous
gambling plant as Ingleside. But all good peo
ple must be awake and alert, for the enemy
sletpeth not. We must know what we want,
demand It and get it. The power Is our* If we
but use our right.
Burglar Takes Clothing.
A. Lehman, who rooms at 223
Franklin street, is now minus his Sun
day clothing, which was stolen out of
his room some time during Saturday
night. The thief was apparently well
acquainted with the interior of Leh
man's room, as he entered while the
man and his wife were asleep and car
ried off the wearing apparel without
disturbing them. A description of the
missing garrients has been furnished

Threatens Negro's Life.
Joseph Foran, a coachman, em

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1905,
THUG WAYLAYS
A BARTENDER
John E. Towne Is Beaten
and Bobbed by Bold High
wayman on Barbary Coast
JAW AND BIBS BBOKEN
Watch and Coin Taken From
Victim Are Found in the
Boom of Supposed "Fence*
John E. Towne, a bartender living
at 1683 Page street, lies in bed at his
home in a sorely battered condition as
a result of an encounter witn a high
wayman on the "Barbary Coast" early
yesterday morning. The holdup man
stepped out of a doorway, struck
Towne on the head with a blunt in
strument and after robbing him of a
watch and chain, knife and $13. in
coin, left him 'lying on the sidewalk.
The holdup occurred at the corner
of Montgomery avenue and Broadway
shortly after 3 o'clock. Towne was on
his way home when he was attacked.
He says the ruffian jumped out of a
doorway, and dealt him a heavy blow.
After that Towne was unconscious un
til he woke up half an hour later. He
limped with difficulty up Montgomery
avenue till he found Patrolman Ba
kulich, to whom he related his expe
rience with the highwayman.
Backulich started an investigation.
Late in the afternoon he visited the
rooms of Robert Comaro at Dupont
and Vallejo streets and after a care
ful search, discovered two $5 pieces
and the watch and knife stolen from
Towne. The articles were carefully
secreted under a mattress. The watch
and knife were covered with mud.
Comaro has long been suspected by
the police of acting as a "fence," or
one who receives and disposes of prop
erty stolen by burglars. He was ar
rested later by Bakulich and held at
the City Prison pending an investiga
tion. The police think his brother
may know something about the rob
bery and are looking for him.
Towne is suffering from a broken
jaw, two fractured ribs and several
minor bruises and scratches. He
thinks "he was hit with a club or some
blunt weapon. He is unable to fur
nish the police with any description of
his assailant, as he says he was taken
by surprise.
RAILROADS BUSILY
BUILDING IN WEST
Magnate James J. Hill Is Preparing to
Invade the Territory of the
Haniman Lines.
The local construction department
of the Harrlman lines is interested in
the preliminary work now under way
by James J. Hill for building a branch
of the Great Northern from Sioux City
to Omaha. It will connect with the
Burlington lines in Western Nebraska,
The new branch will give shorter con
nection to the Pacific over the Hill
roads. Northern Pacific and Great
Northern, and means the expenditure
of a large sum for treminals at Sioux
City and additional terminals at
Omaha. To local railroad men this
move iS regarded as an invasion by the
Hill" syndicate of the Harriman terri
tory and is expected to result in some
lively competition between the two big
railroad interests for business in tjjat
particular section of the West.
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Company is about to award contracts
to Lantry & Sharp for the building of
the first forty miles of the proposed
new line across Arizona and New Mex
ico, which will take the place of the
present main l'ne. The cut-off will
extend from Congress Junction, just
north of Phoenix, west toward th-i
Colorado River. These changes have
been made imperative by floods and
washouts. The Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company is soon to build a
branch from Tekoa, Wash., eastward,
by way of the confluence of the St.
Maries and St. Joe rivers, to the Coeur
d'Alene Reservation.
Director of Maintenance and Opera
tion Julius Kruttschnit of the Har
r'man lines has placed another large
order for equipi ient. It includes pas
senger coaches, chair cars, baggage
and postal cars. They will be dis
tributed to the San Pedro, Los Angeles
and Salt Lake road; Southern Pacific,
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany and Kansas City Southern.

INSULTS MONGREL DOG
AND GETS A THRASHING
C. W. Smith Is Too Particular About
the Company His Blooded
Canines Keep.
Because C. W. Smith **ras differ par
ticular about the kind of canine com
pany his dogs kept, he received an
ugly cut on the head yesterday. Smith
was walking along Webster street ac
companied by his pet bow wow. A
yellow dog with dejected whiskers
ani all the marks of the plebeian ap
proached Smith's animals wagging his
tail.
"Get out," shouted Smith.
â¢ "What's the matter?" inquired a
tattered individual, who resembled
the mongrel. "Ain't my dog good
enough to associate with your geez
ers? He's the best rat dog in the
city."
"He's a sooner," retorted Smith.
"Keep him away from my dogs."
The mongrel's master struck Smith
over the head with an umbrella.
"Don't you insult my dog," he yelled,
flourishing the weapon over the pros
trate owner of the aristocratic can
ines. "All dogs is free and equal.
Take your ki-yis to Blingum if they're
too good for this place."
Smith's cut was dressed by Dr. Wil
son at the Central Emergency Hospi
tal. _

ORPHEUM BILL
WORTH SEEING
Entertainment at the Popu
lar Playhouse Combines
Music, Fun and Acrobatics
SEXTET IS VEEY GOOD
Joseph Murphy in "Shaun!
Bhue" Pleases a Large
Audience at the California
Very strong in chiffons. If not in
voice, is the Carter de Haven sextet,
that leads the Orpheum bill this week.
The sextet is late of the gone but not
forgotten Weber & Fields aggrega- J
tion, with Carter de Haven from any
where in yie bill dropping into the big
type. Mr. de Haven may deserve it <
some day; he has a heel thtt might al- j
most have landed him there now. How- i
ever, it is as a miniature Weber &
Fields that he is entitled to chief atten
tion.
The. turn is a Weber & Fields show j
In miniatureâminiature burlesque, a j
chorus in miniature, and with even a 1
miniature Lillian Russell. There is only ;
nothing miniature about the manage
ment, the littleproduction being mount- \
ed in what the press agents call "su
perb" fashion. The ladies are chiffoned,
spangled and ruffled three or four times
during the turn, all in handsomest
manner, and Mr. de Haven does his
best for the sextet in a trio of suits by
Poole. As to the entertainment, the
sextet sings, dances, plays the piano,
burlesques, much as the sprouting
Weber & Fieldians might have done,
and fills un twenty minutes or so in |
pleasant fashion. Mr. de Haven and
Carrie Bowman, in imitation of Charlie
Ross and Lillian Russell, furnish the
fun. I
Binns, Blnns and Blnns are others
new on the bill. Binns the third Is new ;
here, but the others are old favorites, j
They bring a new musical turn, with, j
I think, the first Stroh violin tp come \
here. The instrument is well Vworth ;
hearing as a curiosity, having the ef- j
feet of an unusually powerful violini
with an intermixture of the brass tone. !
The instrument is without the usual
wooden belly, having instead an alu- |
mlnum sounding "board" below the:
bridge that communicates with a silver â¢
trumpet-like tube running alongside
the finger board. Binns knows how to i
play it, too, and the trio also revive the j
lost art of concertina playing, fiddles a 1
bit with the piano, tootles cleverly on
the cornet and furnishes some excellent j
fun, by the way.
Alcide Capitaine, "the perfect worn- j
an," is another new entertainer. By j
much the Capitaine is the prettiest I
thing in gymnasts that comes this way. j
She is a small but absolutely symmet- j
rlcal creature, with a profile that might j
have been imported from Greece. Her
work, mostly on the flying trapeze and
the rope, is a marvel of grace and dar- j
ing and as easy as Tetrazzini's scales.
Sleight of hand, hypnotism and com- 1
edy are ingeniously intermingled in the
act of the "great Thereses," who "hyp
notises" a confederate with distinctly
amusing and almost convincing results.
Of the rest. Will Cressy and Blanche
Dayne for their third week revive "Bill
Biffin's Baby." Mr. Cressy Is his own
inimitable New England self here, and
Miss Dayile is useful in the support, j
The ten Nelsons continue their sensa- i
tional "stunts," and Clifford and Burke !
and the four Avolas complete the bill.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
â¦ â¢ â¢
An appreciative audience of the men
and women who love the Emerald Isle
greeted "Old" Joe Murphy at the
California Theater last evening. Mur
phy is the youngest looking "old"
man that ever played a part, and he;
is always fresh in the memories of
the people from the land of peat. j
Larry Donovan is Murphy's ideal j
character. The California was packed j
to the balcony-shadowed rows of the j
rear house during the "Kerry Gow" j
enjoyment, but Shaun Rhue was even j
more to the Irish fancy than the initial :
Murphy characterization. Not a seat j
was left on sale at 8:30 o'clock.
There was many a tear in an Irish !
eye when Mr. Murphy sang "A Hand
ful of Earth" between the second and
third acts. There seemed to be the I
vim and vigor of Erin in the applause
that greeted the pathetic verses. Sen- j
ator "Dick" Welch, who escaped from i
Sacramento long enough to join a party
of well known men of Irish ancestry,,
thumped Dr. A. P. O'Brien's ur- j
brella so hard on the floor of a stage
box that he jolted the handle Into the j
popping optic of James Scanlan.
Ireland's pathetic memories stood as
if in bas relief In every one of Joe i
Murphy's lines. Years seemed to have ,
added "tone and fervor to his presenta- >
tions. The rest of the company did ex- i
cellent work, but "Old" Joe Murphy
was the soul of it all, and without Joe j
Murphy "Shaun Rhue" would be like j
Ireland without a shamrock.

Mrs. Smith Placed Under Arrest.
Mrs. Josephine Smith was arrested
at the Chronicle building yesterday
afternoon for disturbing the peace.
She was released In a few minutes on
$50 cash bail, furnished by her attor
ney. She was arrested on a warrant
svorn to by Mrs. Ada M. Bryant of
The Gables, Clay and Larkin streets.
Mrs. Bryant accuses Mrs. Smith of
calling upon her Thursday last and
using vile language. Mrs. Smith's hus

Southern Pacific Company, lives at The
Gables and Mrs. Smith says she went
there with Policeman Mangan to get

RUNS FAR WITH
HIS NECK CUT
William B. Davis Severs His
Windpipe and Eushes to
Hall of Justice for Aid
IS SAVED BY SUEGEOX
Dr. Kucich Sews Ends of the
Larynx Together and Ite
stores Man's Eespiration
William *R. Davis, a negro porter,
severed his windpipe with a razor last
night in an attempt to take his life.
Regretting his action as soon as he felt
the pain inflicted by the sharp blade,
the injured man ran five blocks to the
Hall of Justice for aid, leaving a
stream of blood in his wake.
Davis was formerly a porter for A.
Zellerbach & Sons', paper dealers at 416
Sansome street. For the last month Ac
has been sick and out of work. Liquor
did the rest. The negro took to drink
and despondency ensued. Last night In
his room at 1006 Clay street Davis
meditated over his condition. Carefully,
he says, he stropped his razor and de
liberately slashed his neck.
After Davis cut his throat he changed
his mind about dying and rushed mad
ly to the Hall of Justice. Breathing
through the cut end of his larynx, the
injured man dashed past startled pe
destrians with blood streaming from
the huge wound in his neck and ran
into the Central police station. Lieu
tenant Green sent Davis to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital, where Dr.
Kucich performed a delicate operation,
sewing the ends of the larynx together
and probably saving the man's life. If
pneumonia does not set In Davis has a
good chance to recover.

MOB THREATENS
GRIPMAN'S LIFE
Frenzied Crowd Struggles
to Do Violence to Carman
Who Buns Down M. Green
M. Green, a contractor and builder, of
1122 Howard street, was run over by a
Hayes-street car at Seventh and Mar
ket streets last night and died from
a fractured skull at the Central Emer
gency Hospital.
A howling mob surrounded the car
immediately after the accident and
threatened the life of the gripman, Ed
win Dittner. It required the combined
efforts of Sergeant Bush and three po
licemen to keep the crowd at bay.
Green's mangled body was taken from
beneath, the heavy vehicle with great
difficulty and the injured man was
rushed to the hospital.
Green was crossing the tracks in
front of the car about 10 o'clock last
night. As the car neared him he
slipped and fell. Spectators ray that
Gripman Dittner had ample time to
bring his car to a stop, but that he al
lowed it to run down the unfortunate
man. Dittner denies that he did not
use every effort to stop his car in time,
and says the tracks were so slippery
that the wheels slid.
While Green was being taken from
under the car the policemen kept the
mob away. Angry threats were hurled
at Dittner and he was saved from vio
lence only by the policemen, who bran
dished their clubs.
Dr. Kucich found that Green had sus
tained a fracture of the base of the
skull and a general contusing, of the
body. Green's identity was a mystery
for some time until his friend E. W.
Kirk, called at the hospital and identi
fied him. He died at 1 a. m. to-day.

Lehman, 223 Franklin street, reported to the

house Saturday night and stole $31 worth
of clothing. The front door had been opened
with a key and he suspects a man who
formerly roomed there. Miss Harriet Ger
nosset, 1802 Hyde street, reported that a
satchel containing wearing apparel valued at
$:J0 was stolen on Saturday afternoon. She left
the satchel hanging on the handle of the door
while she went inside for a minute. When
she returned it had disppeared.

MYTHICAL FARM
ALLURES YOUTH
Charles Bierne Declares He
Paid Harry Wilson $100
but Failed to Get Ranch
An alleged land bunko man in the
person of Harry Wilson, alias Harry
Hitchcock, was arrested last night by
Patrolman Herlihey and registered at
the Central Police Station pending an
investigation. The complaining wit
ness is Charles Bierne, eighteen years
of age, who lives with his mother at
Bi3 Folsom street.
Bierne declares that he met Wilson
several weeks ago and the latter de
frauded him out of SIOO on a fake land
deal. According to the lad's story, he
encountered Wilson one night when
the latter confided in him a scheme he
had for selling a firfe piece of land near
Stockton, where a young man might
start a farm and with a little money
work the property along and make a
paying investment out of it.
Bierne says he took the story In good
faith and the following day went to
Stockton with Wilson, who showed him
a piece of land a short distance outside
the town and offered to let him have it
at a reasonable figure. The boy was
impressed with the offer and after con
sulting his mother told Wilson he
would buy the property.
Wilson consented to sell, but de
manded a deposit of SIOO before the
deal could be closed. Bierne says he
got the money and paid it over to Wil
son who Immediately disappeared.
The youth went to Stockton a few days
later to claim his farm, only to find
that Jt belonged to another. Then he
realized he had been bunkoed.
He says he was on the lookout for
Wilson since that time but never laid
eyes on him till last night when he saw
him in company with another young
fellow at the ferry. This third person
told Bierne he was going to Stockton to
purchase a farm from Wilson. Patrol
man Herlihey happened along at that
moment and Bierne pointed out Wilson
to him as the man who had bunkoed
him. The other lad disappeared when
he saw the officer take hold of Wilson.
The accused man is not known to the
police. He is a well-appearing person
with a glib tongue and smooth man
ners. He stoutly protests his inno
cence. Detectives will be put to work
on the case to-day.
