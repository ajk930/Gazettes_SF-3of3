"There- should "noti be the slightest
danger," he said,' "from the ; casg"at
Swinburne Island. It is to be presumed
that your health physicians have en
closed patient by mosquito bars, for
in no other way can the disease be
transmitted to another. If other cases
should develop among the passengers
or crews of the steamships, which are
constantly arriving from infected ports,
the danger would not be increased, for
the treatment would remain the same
and the spread of the disease stopped.
We are yet in our infancy in the matter
of the discoveries of the transmission
of such diseases by insects, but in the
matter of yellow fe%*er infection all
credit should be given to the Yankees,
who went ahead of our eminent men
and demonstrated that the stegoma was
the vehicle that caused all the trouble.
"Therefore, I repeat, . lreep out the
mosquitoes â the stegoma, the yellow
fever carrier, the anopheles, the ma
laria breederâ and do not despise the
health destroying powers of the culex,
the common fellow who is so plentiful
and persistent in the majority of places
where he can transmit diseases readily,
and there is no doubt that this common
mosquito is the first cause of many
serious and sometimes fatal illnesses."
Years of research in the tropics have
convinced the physician that only by
prevention of the bite of the mosquito
and other blood-seeking insects can
freedom from tropical' diseases be as
sured. Arriving in this country when,
the yellow fever Is- ravaging- New Or-
leans and one case' has developed' 'in
the harbor of New York, the opinion" of

NEW YORK. Aug. 6. â 'Next to whis
ky, mosquitoes are the greatest curse
to mankind," said Sir Patrick Manson
to-day at his apartments at the Hol
land House. Sir Patrick is physician
and medical adviser to the British co
lonial office and eminent because he
was the first physician to discover that
the mosquito was the worst of the ma
larial parasites. He arrived with Lady
Jltmson on the Lucania, and will leave
to-morrow afternoon for San Francisco.
where, before the Cooper Medical Col
lege, he will deliver a series of lectures
on "Tropical Diseases."
AEW YORK, Aug. 6 Sufficient evi
dence already has come to the Arm
strong legislative insurance Investigat
ing committee to make clear to its
members that the conditions existing
in the Equitable have , been more than
duplicated, in some respects, in sev
eral other bis insurance coinyaules, two
of thent being in this city and two
otliers outside.
It is admitted that it is riot within
the province- of the legislative com
mittee: to investigate insurance cor
porations in New Jersey or Connecti
cut, but in the 'examination to be con
ducted the testimony which, necessarily
must "be brought out will reveal the
methods, of the interstate "organiza
tions.
The startling information has come \
to members of the legislative commit
tee that since 'the broad* misuse ' of.
director power .by. 'the Equitable So
ciety, has become, public,^; books and j
, other . documents -have-been 'doctored : in
certain life insurance :so
that as; far : as possible- a, fairly; cle>n
bill of health may; be~-shown' atter-the
legislative probe. has been inserted into
their affairs. ; \u25a0 " -j : â¢
~A minority 'member of the legislative
committee" said to-day that he could
prove, and probably 'would prove, that
certain ' 'men connected with a great
bankinfl house in Wall- street â that
banking hoizse having relations with
other ' financial institutions \u25a0in New
York, Boston, Chicago, London, Paris
affd Berlinâ had undertaken,' through
certain prominent politicians, the busi
ness of preventing certain facts from
coming to light. These facts would
show, it was said, that at least two big
insurance corporations not only were
affected by loose management' and
graft to a greater extent than the
I Equitable, but that two, in order to
get a "rake-off" for their own directors,
and, perhaps, a favored few outside the
directory, had been able, because of
questionable loans, to place their own
officials in" certain banking houses.
, It was said the revelations that would
follow a' thorough inquiry into this
matter were so deeply significant

being made by big financiers â¢ and
equally' big politicians to confine the
investigation wholly to remedial meas

CHICAGO. Aug. 6. â Because she !
thought life was not worth while since
the death of her father and mother,
Miss Elizabeth Burgess, daughter of
the late William Burgess of Mattoon,
111., and heiress to $500,000. climbed
through a porthole of the steamship
Manitou. en route to Mackinac, and j
ended her life "in the waters of the
lake. The body has not been recovered.

w;ll be recovered.
.miss Elizabeth Burgess had been un

died within a year after the death of j

little to arouse suspicion, . her sister j

a battle between members of the big
Chinese societies iivthe#Chineso theater
in Dorey street to-night three Chinese
were killed, two others probably fatally
wounded and many others injured.
When'the police succeeded in breaking
up the riot they, had arrested more than
enough inhabitants of the Chinese dis
trict to fill the Elizabeth-street ai.d
other police stations in the vicinity. -
According to a report made' t>y the
police the Hip Sing Tong started the
trouble and deliberately selected the
Chinese theater, which is seldom vis-,
ited by the police, as the' most favor- -j
able scene for operations. The theater
holds about 400 people' and on. Sunday
night. when. the quarter is crowded with
visiting Celestials from all over the j
metropolitan district it is always pack- J
cd. When the battle began not a ' seat
was to be- had, as many were standing.
Among the latter in the back of. the
theater were several of the Hip/Sing
Tong' members with big, 44-caliber re
volvers concealed beneath their flowing
garments.
Suddenly, as the. actors, on the stage
reached a climax in the "play, there was
a loud explosion,' quickly : followed by'
several; others in the front of the'the
ater near the stage. The actors fled in
terror and the packed audience surged
as far as it could*; toward v the* rear,
where several of > the Hip Sing . Tongs
began an indiscriminate fusillade into
the throng. It developed later that'tho
first explpsions were made by huge fire
crackers. Finally,* in desperation, the
! audience charged on the men with, the
revolvers, and bearing them down got
to the oneexit which was open. There
they fought desperately ..to -reach the
street. The first explosion had;startled

the mother of the young man. For
some time past young Casty has been
subject to temporary attacks of Insan
ity, and only recently he ran away
from his home In this city and was lo
cated only after much difficulty. in
the hope of improving his health his
mother took him out to the ranch a
short time ago and he seemed to grow
slightly better.
Yesterday morning he took a shotgun
from the house and went out hunting.
When he had not returned at 4 o'clock
in the afternoon his mother went to
look for him, only â¢to flnd his body.
Oasty leaves, besides his mother, a
father. Richard Ca sty, and a brother

LONDON, Aug. 6.â Another wealthy
American woman has decided to make,
her home in England. She is Mrs.
Franklyn Barton, who lived for some
years in St. Louis, but who has made
her home for some time past in New
York. Her husband accumulated his
fortune in railway and mining specula
tions and although she has not made
any great pretensions to wealth in the
United States she is understood to be
mistress of a couple of million dollars,
which amounts to a good deal here.
Ebe intends having both a London and
a country residence, and according to
negotiations that are at present pro
ceeding it Is probable that she will be
come the tenant, and perhaps the own
er, of the lovely residence In Cadogan
Gardens where Mrs.,Langtry lived when
Â«he was the reigning favorite of King
Edward, who was then Prince of
Wale*. He used to visit her there,
and It -was at that house occurred the
famous chunk of ice episode which so
chilled the royal backbone'and Bhocked
the Prince's sense of dignity that he
cut the Jersey Lily dead next day in
Hyde Park. One of the most commodi
ous mansions on the Earl of Cadogan's
estate, it has lost nothing in value be
cause of Its associations with royalty
and beauty. When it is let furnished
for the society season it commands
easily $1500 a month.
Mrs*J3arton's country residence will
be soSfewhere in the neighborhood of
Manchester, as she has family connec
tions with the great cotton city, from
whence her husband's ancestors came.
She is herself a native of New Bed
ford, Mass., and although she means to
make her home permanently in Eng
land she will pay annual visits to the
United States to look after some in
terests which she has In railways and
mines there.

months . refitting. She haa betn . 114
days from there... .. ...

: (LONDON, : Aug." 6."â By all T odds the
most striking thingabout the plans for
the coming theatrical' season in London
Is' the way American, plays dominate
the situation. Account for it* as you
like, either , by: the' oft-proclaimed "pov
erty" of the native drama, or the suc
cess won in the metropolis last year by
pieces from. across the water, the fact
remains that no previous dramatic yÂ«ar
has started off with so many American
works underscored for production. Ac
cording to .'present' arrangements the
season will" open with' one of tnemâ C.
M. S. : McLellan's new comedy, "On the
Love Path," in which Ellis Jeffreys is
to appear. , So far,; McLellan has two
big successes to his credit hereâ "The
Belle "of New .York" and "Leah
Kleschna," which is still running in St.
Martin's Lane- -and two failures. "Glit
tering Gloria" and "The Whirl of the
Town," so there is quite a bit of
curiosity to see "On the Love Path,."
It will be produced early in August by
Frederick Harrison of. the Haymarket,
who is rather noted for picking . win
ners. ' - - .
Charles Hawtrey Is now appearing at
tho Avenue in a short revival of his
old standby, "The Message From
Mars," but he has just announced his
intention of starting business next sea
son with "The Crisis." the dramatiza
tion of Churchill's novel which Hackett
used in the United States. Whether the
venture will succeed is another mat
ter, but It will 'be Interesting at all
events to see Hawtrey as an American.
The, name of tho piece Is likely to be
changed for use in this country, as it is
generally associated with the English
version of Augier's "Les Fourchani
bault," which was -played at the Hay
market.'
If present arrangements hold, the
Duke of York's, now 'occupied, by Bar
ries "Alice Sit-by-the-Fire." will,. be
reopened by Frohman - with Gillette In
his, new play," "Clarisse." "The Dicta
tor" has been withdrawn temporarily
at the Comedy, but will be put on again
as soon as the hot weather Is over, and
afterward Collier will be seen jin Au
gustus Thomas', play, "On the Quiet."
Martin ; Harvey ! is : coming: buck to town
early In the fall with a new play, which
ho has just- accepted; from" Marlon
Crawford.^.. lt is unnamed as yet, but
Martin Harvey describes it as "serious"
and; says he hopes to do even better
with it than he has done with that
other. Crawford play, "A : Cigarette
maker's, Romance." , " .
7 Another -American-made play which
will be seen early in- the coming season
is Stanislaus Stange's "School, for
Husbands," which ; Jessie Mill ward, lost
to this country for over six years, Is
going, to probably at Terry's.
'Meanwhile .-plans 'are -well advanced for
reopening the Shaftesbury under , the
Shubert management with the 'Amer
ican \ musical piece, "Fantana," and ? I

LONDON GOSSIP
OF THE STAGE
SCHMITZ IS INDORSED.
ing visit in "The Music Master" is the
exact date.
"When Eleanora Duse's season at the
Waldorf came to an end a few days ago
It was. officially -. announced- that the
great tragedienne would >. be - seen no
more in: the metropolis.* "Slsnora Duse
is wishful of retiring, from the stage,"
observed an Inspired statement from
th Â©^theater.. "She is^ anxious to settle
down in: her Italian. riome/V' l^- 3 a mat
ter '". of fact. - Duse isn'^t coming back
here* because she is "sore" on London.
At the Waldorf she played to practi
cally empty benches. She always has
played to empty benches in the metro
polis, .and she means to suffer this in
dignity no more. Speaking generally,
London, which has become almost to
tally frivolous, doesn't care a hang for
foreign actors. Even Bernhardt. has to
have a spectacular piece, such as "An
gelo" or "La Sorclere," if she hopes to
make money here. Rejane and Coque
lln have a . slight following but there
Is practically no Interest in any other
continental actors. Ristorl never drew
here and neither did Rossi nor Salvinl.
Quite recently a lot of interest was
aroused here by the announcement
that Mrs! Patrick Campbell and H. B.
Irving, Sir Henry's talented son. were
I about to join forces. It has now been
decided that they will appearâ possibly
on both sides of the. water- â In a dra
matic version of "Tristram and Iseult,"
by J. Comyns Carr, who wrote "King
Arthur" for Sir Henry Irving, and re
cently adapted "Oliver Twist" for Beer
bohm Tree. Carr says that his play
embodies many incidents and situations
described in the original legend which
Wagner probably thought - unsuitable
for * musical treatment. . These Include
the earlier fortunes of the' hero in Ire
land and the healing of his poisoned
wound by the . magic power of King
Gormon's daughter. All fortune to the
venture, but it 'is one regarding which
It would be risky to prophesy.
Alfred Sutro, whose play, "The Walls
of Jericho," is now well past its 350 th
night at the Garrick, has Just placed
two new works. One called "The Way
of a Fool" has been taken by Lewis
Waller, who will use It at tha Imperial;
the other ; was written especially for
Ellis Jeffreys and will be done by her
In the United .States when she- sets
back in January next. " Meanwhile It
will ; be Interesting to see If American
play-goers take kindly to "The Walls
Estimates as to the number of votes
that will be cast In San Francisco at the
primary election to-morrow vary all the
way from 30,000 to 50,000.
Enthusiastic, supporters of the Republi
can League predict a popular .uprising of .
citlzans who have hitherto neglected the
Important duty of vpting at 'the primary.
If the uprising takes place, even in an or
dinary degree, and the vote exceeds 35,000
the league ticket will win. On the other
hand, if a very large percentage of the
87.000 registered voters stay away from
the polls the grafters wilr carry the -day.
It is a sure thing that the grafters will
vote, hence. the pertinent Inquiry is ad
dressed to citizens by the San Francisco
Republican League. "What will you do?"
The most remarkable phase of the con
test is the attitude of the grafters in
using the term "Regular Republican."
Reports come from the Thirty-sixth Dis
trict that several -wel} meaning citizens
have been deceived by the representation
of Ruefters that tickets In opposition to
the San Francisco Republican League
were authorized by the Republican Coun
ty Committee. The plain facts are that
the county committee by an overwhelm
ing vote rejected the proposition ad
vanced by Ruef and Ach to organize
against the league.
The San Francisco Republican League
leader? are in possession of positive in
formation that Ruef pays for the print
ing, folding and addressing of all the op
position tickets. In the Thirty-sixth, as
in every other Assembly district, the only
Republican ticket is the ticket put for
ward by the San Francisco Republican
League and It ia plainly designated
"Anti-Ruef." Voters should beware of
every ticket that Is not heralded as.
"Anti-Ruef."
The fact is well known all , along the
line, and Republican voters should not
lose sight of it to-morrow, that the 80
called "Regular Republicans" marching
under Ruef's colors are the out and out
supporters of the Schmitz administration,
and the only "purpose they have In view
in seeking election as delegates to the
Republican local convention \u25a0is to < nomi
nate a man for Mayor . who will be an
easy mark for Schmitx. Ruef fancies
that this party betraya,l dodge is clever
politics and he plumes himself on his
cleverness as a politician every time he
betrays his party.
It is represented to the Republican
League that Frank French of Sacramento
boodllng notoriety is doing Ruef s poll
tics in the Thirty-fourth Assembly Dis
trict. F. V. Severance, who was known
as French's Assemblyman, ' heads . the
Ruef ticket- Edward Short, ; who was
one of French's clerks in the Legislature,
is on the ticket. In the main the ticket
is composed of old-time losers. The
bunch if elected, would take the Ruef
programme off the reel. \ Republicans
who hold that the district should be
honorably represented in the Republican
local convention .will vote for the anti-
Ruef ticket of the San Francisco Repub
lican League. The name of,C M. Ritter
heads the only genuine Republican ticket
in the Thirty-fourth. .
One of the delegates on the Severance
ticket belonged to the jury that acquitted
"Chaw" Casey of fighting his bulldogs
at the Mission on Sunday.
The camera will play a part. In the
primary election contest to-morrow. A
ballot-box etuffer hates a camera. The
proof obtained by the photographer can
not be sworn away! The
League proposes < to use the camera In
precincts where the stuffing of the
grafter is notorious. -In- the Twenty
eighth and Twenty-ninth districts row
dies, ex-convicts and shady characters
threaten to do Ruef politics. It is a safe
proposition to wager that the workers
for the Republican League will â¢ not be
; chased away from " the precinct' voting
i places.
The prospects of defeating Maestretti
in the Thirty-ninth District are bright.
I The house to house canvass assures the
! success of the "Wheela^Casslfiy move
ment to oust the Maestretti , gang.;. In
this district the United Independent Club
Is allied with the Ban Francisco Repub
lican League. .'/;' . .
Citizens of the Thirty-ninth who desire
that the district shall be ably and credit
ably represented In the , local
convention should support the ticket
headed by Fairfax H. , Wheelan. ./ .
The Maestretti: delegates if .elected
would be compelled to tlirow the true in
terests of the district' to the winds and
take whatever programme "; Ruef pre
sented. *' '
A vote for the antl-Ruef ticket is a vote
I fnr the orosnorltv and rlavalnnment of the
Thirty-ninth. Later on the ' citizens can
give Maestretti a certificate to the effect
that he is honest in his desire of "vindi
cation." ' ,
LOS ANGELES. Aoig. 6.â To thÂ« deadly

The Anti-Ruef United Labor League,
an organization created by union work
ingmen -who refuse â¢to acknowledge
Ruef asthelr master aÂ»d dictator, has
nominated a ticket of delegates in
every Assembly district of -the city.
The . founders of the league issue the
following address to the labor vote of
San Francisco:' ' \u0084
TO ALL UNION LABOR MEN AND THEIR
' , SYMPATHIZERS. . ...
I ; . Your attention Is called to the within sticker
containing the names of Union Labor men,
offering themselves as delegates to the Union
Labor Convention. ' . \u25a0 â¢ ' * :
The -effort lp >now- being honestly made to
' create a Union -Labor convention .which will
be union labor IN FACT as well as In name.
The first Union Labor convention was an
honest representation of labor In this city.
: It was free and independent, and it command
ed the respect and to a greater extent- it com
manded the 'votes- of union labor than any
"convention' has since. ' ''-.'.'\u25a0 : â¢
The last two conventions of 'the Union Labor
party have been the creatures of Air. Abe
Huef- He has been the colitical boss.
Mr. Ruef does not even claim allegiance to
the- Union' Labor party. The- tickets, he has
dictated .he himself has not supported. He
does not now promise to euxiport the labor
ticket. \u25a0 He - proclaims himself a Republican.
\u25a0At. this time by every corrupt means known
to the political wire puller he is endeavoring
to encompass the election of his political chat
telt, \u25a0\u25a0"â¢"\u25a0 to both Republican and' Unian Labor
conventions, his avowed . purpose being to sup
port only the candidate for Mayor on the
Union Labor, ticket end trade off all the rest
of the candidates. â¢ .Â»..*-..'.
The scheme is a bold .one indeed, but not
calculated !to enlist the \u25a0 sympathies of honest
men in either party. We believe, that political
parties were created -for the purpose of ad
.vancing principles . that would redound to the
â¢advantage of a free people. '

What Are You Going to Do About It?
..'Are you going -to be a party to his dishonest
political; methods and their > resulting graft, to
the utter disgrace of San Francisco, and to the
dishonor of every union labor man in this city;
or, .are you going to help elect a, convention
that will repudiate Ruef and his methods? -
â Every man upon the sticker here presented to,
you for your consideration is a bpna tide union
labor man, carrying: a union card. If elected
these men . will " fdrm a convention that will be
truly A FRKE AND REPRESENTATIVE LA
BOR.CONVENTION. They will wear no collar
and by their conduct will place such a ticket
in the field that union labor can honestly sup
port â a ticket which will redeem. the good name
of union labor, co long disgraced by association
with Mr. ;' Abraha m'; Ruef. \u25a0 ,- â¢
If you are in harmony with' the Ideas -here
expressed, viz: the rescuing -of - union labor
from the base uses It has Deen put by Abe
Ruef and his creatures, you will take 'this
sticker containing the names of union labor
men with you Into the .voting booth and paste
it into the Xlnion Labor ballot. You will then
have performed \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 your duty, unless i t may -be

Dr. I. C. Meserve Calls Upon Citizens; to
Go to Primaries and Vote Right'
The Rev. I. C. Meserve. D. D., pastor .
of Plymouth Congregational Church, last!
night made urgent reference to -the need j
of casting, votes for; strong and good of
ficials for San Francisco; and said It
would be nothing i short of criminal to
neglect to vote at the primary. His re
marks were made from the pulpit.
"Choose reliable men to nominate re
liable men,"' he advised.
Among other things Dr. Meserve said:
The citizens of San Francisco- have now the
opportunity of saying who shall be nominated
for officers of the city. Hitherto the party
leaders have done this ana the voters could
only ratify at the polls, or refuse to ayote.
Now we have a chance to do the nominating
ourselves. Let every man among you eetze
that chance without* fail. One -thing to bo
done Is to break "boss"' rule in this city. It
is imperialism of the .worst sort. The Czar is
n6 more an. autocrat than is the "boss."
And we are free Americans, better
able to say what shall be ' done In the
city than Is the boss, who is never by
any chance a first-class- man. Arouse
yourselves nnd rdo your "duty, which
means govern: yourselves, and put the
â¢'boas" out of business. /

City Hall. Sweeping' Is called for. It Is sim
ply common- knowledge that such is the case.

to such a city as this than the one now In

COVINGTOX. Ky., Aug 6. â Congress
man Rhinock made known to-night the
name of the person who furnished Rob
ert â¢W. Criswell, editor of the New
Torker, with libelous* information re
garding Alice Roosevelt's visit to the
Latonia race track, where she was in
troduced to Rhinock. It was Criswell's
cjose friend, George Mortimer .Roe, who
is now located in California. He wrote
Rhinock from Los Angeies, admitting
the authorship of the information.
Rhinock will turn over the letter to the
New York authorities. Crlswell com
mitted suicide last Thursday night in
New York by leaping in front of a sub
way train.
Roe's letter reads:
J. L. Khlnock. Covington, Ky. â Dear Sir:
In a fragmentary way, through the newspapers
and personal notes. I bave learned vt me
criminal proceedings brought by you against
R. \V. Crlswell for uttering certain charges
against or concerning you In New York, and
In the same indirect way I have learned that
it war not so much to punish Crtswtll' that
you brought proceedings as it was to smoke
out the name of the person who had given
faia the Information. It was never necessary
tor you to go to all that trouble if your only
purpose wu to secure the name of the in
formant. .
1 never attempted to conceal my Identity in
the matter and If I were ever disposed to fur
nish anonymous information I certainly could
have had no reason for doing no In this in
stance. I wrote the Information to Criswell
in a personal note, not for publication, but I
was indifferent. I will bÂ« frank to say, as to
whether he printed it or not.
I gave it to him as I have given him other
Information and as he htd givtn it to me in a
personal correspondence that we have carried
00 at Intervals for many years* I wrote a
letter to htm at the time when the newspapers
of Cincinnati, particularly the Post and the
<7itlxens* Bulletin were full of g-oesip concern-
Ing Alice Roosevelt's â¢'â¢islt to Cincinnati and
Latonla. In the letter I Inclosed a clipping
from Mr. Pendleton's paper reciting the in
troduction episode, \u25a0which you will no doubt
recall.
I sent the letter and clipping mere as my
contribution to "The Gayety of Nation*" as
idle gossip. aÂ« was much of the other stuff
that was printed at the time. As to any mal
ice in the premises, how could there have
been any? I don't believe you would know
in* If you should meet me face to face and I
doubt if I should know you under the same
circumstances. We have never nfet, to my
recollection, but once and then about some i
trifling- business which made but little if any
impression on my mind.
I might as well be charged with harboring
malice against some cf. the prophets of the
Old Testament. Now as to the statement con
cerning the Indictment, about which consid
erable, I understand, has been written:
An Instrument purporting to be an indict
ment of J. X*. Rhinock. for snatching a wad

The grafters throughout the city are using the term ".Regular Republican" in efforts to boost the Ruef tickets.* The so-called "Regu

of the Republican party other than that put forward by the, San Francisco Republican League, and in every district the ticket is plainly

ROBBER JOKES
WITH VICTIMS
Joseph Bartlett, a fruit peddler 64
>c2rs of age, was shot yesterday at 11
a. m. by his drunken stepson, Logan
Bell, in front of their home at 42214
Fulton street. The injured man was
hurried to the Emergency Hospital,
\u25a0where he gapped a few times and died.
Bell was booked at the Hall of Justice
for murder.
Mrs. Minnie Bartlett, who was di
vorced from her husband but lived with
him. figured in the murder, as she tried
to prevent her son from committing the
rash act, and now she lies on a cot at
the Emergency Hospital hysterical
from the shock.
Although Bell says he shot his step
father because the latter struck Mrs.
Bartlett. witnesses to the tragedy agree
\ that the act was unprovoked and thn.t
the drunken condition of the son was
accountable for the murder.
Bartlett was in the fruit peddling
business and was divorced from Mrs.
Uartlctt. but made his home with her,
employing Bell as an assistant. His
former \u25a0wife says Bartlett lived with
her about < j !ghtÂ«?eh months before they
\u25ba were married and shortly after the
wedding she learned he had a divorced
\u25a0wife and two daughters living, so she
had the marriage with her annulled.
Bartlett lived with her afterward,
much to the dislike of the son, and the
son and Bartlett quarreled frequently.
Saturday night Bell was paid, a
week's salary and he gpt drunk, re
maining away from home until yester
day morning. ' He attempted to borrow
some money on his return to the house,
but Bartlett refused, censuring him for
his bad habit.
Mrs. Burtlett says that Bell ran into
the yard and grabbed an ax to kill her
former husband. Bartlett met him in
an alleyway leading to the street and
the woman stood between them. An
ger<-d because lie could not reach his
victim. Bell got a L'2-caliber rifle from
the housr: and shot his victim in the
right lung.
to the murder, attracted
by the loud quarrel, were una.nimous
In saying that there can be no valid
claim of self-defense. Bell was drunk
when locked up at the Hall of Justice
etation, but he says Bartlett struck his
mother and he killed him to protect her
life. Neighbors say that Bartlett only
.pushed his former wife aside to grab
the ax from Bell.
Small boys in the vicinity of the
tragedy hurried after a policeman, find-
Ing Officer O'Connor, who arrested the
murderer and sent for the ambulance
to carry Bartlett to the hospital. De
tectives Braig and Taylor were de
tailed and it is their opinion that Bell
was undoubtedly guilty of the murder.
The previous record of the murderer
will not be in his favor, as he was ac-'
cused of assault on a woman in Oak
land five years ago, but was acquitted
on a jury trial. About a year ago he
was charged with assault on a young
grirl in Golden Gate Park and was sen
tenced for three months. Bell, who is
27 years of age, was married once, but
he. also, was divorced, his \u25a0wife living
Jn Stockton. It is alleged that drink
causedthe separation between Bell and
his young wife.
Bartlett was a peaceable man, says
his wife. ai;d did not have any use for
a drinking person. He had $3000 in
Oakland real estate and it is said that
he had two bank accounts in San Fran
fisco, making his wealth total $16,000.
He wae frugal, never allowing his wife
to spend much money. Their home was
a squalid house, situated in the rear of
a small alley leading 'off of Fulton

is a strong and logical plea for an alli

and is of considerable significance, par
ticularly in view of the general politi

is to-day about to establish a General

Professor Howard Swan of London,
who for the last four years has been
industriously instructing the Japanese
In the English language at the Toklo
Higher Commercial College, where his
efforts met with great success, is
among the latest arrivals at the Occi
dental Hotel, having come from the
Orient by way of 3eattle -with the^ln
tention of spending several months on
the Pacific Coast.
In teaching language to the subjects
of the Mikado he adopted a purely
psychological method, of which he has
been a strong advocate for years, and
which he says is the - most practical
method of education in Japan. Discuss
ing hts experiences in the Orient he
said yesterday:.
No nation on " earth is striving harder to
educate Itself than little Japan, whose sub
jects are exceedingly apt scholars and will ab
sorb everything in the way of Information
that Is presented to them.
Among the students of the schools In which
I was engaged tn educational work I found
it to be a great desire of the scholars to learn
as much aa possible of the manners of the
English and American people, aa of their lan
guage, and I endeavored to associate both in
the courses of instruction prepared for them.
In my mind the acquirement of a knowledge
of the English language will be more mate
rially responsible for the future, advancement
of the Japanese empire in thÂ» matter of civil
ization and in its . commercial progress than
any other study. They readily acquire our
manners with our language, and In this way
they are rapidly strengthening themselves aÂ»
a nation.
IDEALS ARE CHANGING.'
It was not long ago that the Japanese re
garded the commercial pursuits of man as Ig
noble, and it was a difficult matter to con
vince them to the contrary. But now the
Government is straining every effort to instill
among the people a taste for commercial pur
suits, anU they are grasping everything in the
way of Information tn that direction. The first
thing they ask you. however, when they hava
sufficiently ' mastered English is about our
ethics. . Having been^taught that \u25a0 commerce
carries with it honor, they seek to add to their
uuali tiicat lotis aa business men the manners
of the gentleman. ' ~ â¢ , :
It was for this" reason tIT-it I undertook " to
Include in the lessons I taught them stories of
how the English ami Americans live; how they
I rise, in the morning, bathe, dress and prepare
I for breakfast; how they . dine and how" thay
j act In the presence of women. You can hardly
Imagine how deeply Interested they arc In all
' this' information and how uufcKly â they adopt
I the manner.-* of the Westerner as 1 pictured
i.them to them. ; â¢ \
Teaching them ttie English language has nut
been a difficult task. for. as I have > already
said, they art very apt. . The greatest 'diffi
culty they experience Is In the proper analys- !
ing. of the vowels, f or. . while our dictionaries
are supposed to properly do so. the analysis Is
not sufficient for thu Japanese smient to freely
comprehend It. 1 tried to rcsldly follow thn-Â«
â¢ principles tn the courses or -instruction, and
I was not lung In realising that they could -be
I satisfactorily employed by all teachers who
i. were ambitious to improve the educational ten
! dÂ«ncles of tho Japanese.
j GIVUS CLEAR CONCEPTIONS.
I furnished the students clear mental plcÂ»
tures. and In lessons of objective fact 1 planned
not to change the ecene too often. In Instruct
ing them in the subjective janguage, or Idioms
of: thought end emotion, my plan was to first
explain literally and then idiomatically, giving
them many examples and : frequent instances.
In 'the 'grammar lessons vie use of example.-*,
v.hlch. applied directly to. me student's life or
action, . either "-in pis. class, ur at bis home.
proTeJ ' most advantageous. Th# teaching, of
phonetics also greatly helped the ambitious
Japanese in "mastering English. â¢ which, by the
way. U - now being studied, by more than a
million students In the oini>|n-.
.Professor Swan, is of the opinion that
England and v America would greatly
profit In : ' the lend if they would take the
indemnity they are â¢ receiving from
China and "apply it in some thorough
manner, to -educating the'Chlnese us
the Japanese are being, "educated. / Sev
eral years' experience in China- has con
vinced ; him "that the establishment of
schools ; on l this _coast for the education
of i Chinese would make a great na
tion of the Orientalists and win for
this country their everlasting srati
tude and eternal respect for our na
tion. ... â¢ ' -
CHI.VA HAS MMITATIOXS.
â¢He concedes, however, that China
never will be a great nation â that is, a
modern nation, until her eighteen prin
cipal dialects are combined in one and
her people have been forced to appre
ciate the urgent need of a central gov
ernment that will correctly administer
all the important affairs of the coun
try. -During hi 3 stay In the Orient
Professor Swan prepared a phonetic"
dictionary of the dialect of Peking,
which he says can be written on a
typewriter and thoroughly understood
by all English-speaking Chinese.- not
withstanding the frequent assertion
that a comprehension of the dialects of
China can only be obtained after- one
has familiarized himself with the -va
rious intonations.

OAKLAND. Aug. 6.â Charred and black
ened beyond Identification, the bodies of
three children of Antone Ferfeira. vic
tims of the fire lost night which destroyed
the humble cottage that was their home,
lie at the Morgue awaiting the arrange
ments for burial that will lake place to
morrow afternoon in St. Mary's Cemetery.
The funeral services will be held simul
taneously over the three children and
they will be interreoVin one plat.
To the tragic death of the little ones.
Antone, aged 6 y^ars, Talvina. a sister, 4
years old, and baby Alfred, 2 years of
age, was added the wiping out of the
family's meager possessions, leaving the
parents penniless and destitute with the
baby who was saved.
Not a vestige was left of the home at
632 Valdez street. East Oakland. Even
Ferreira's ea%ings of $11 from his week's
wages was lost in the fire. He is a la
borer and all of his earnings went to sup
port his family. The cottage was a small,
four-room dwelling, rough -boarded on the
inside. It was a dry. tinder-box affair.
"When. the lamp exploded, spattering the
burning ' oil over the room. . the flames
spread so quickly that the place was all
abl?ze in an instant. It vould have been
only by a miracle that a* human being
could have fought through the fire to res
cue the children.
LJttle Talvina had awakened in time to
try to escape. She had sci ambled' out of
her bed and crawled or run as far as a
window ten feet distant when she was
overcome by the smoke and flames. Her
blackened body was found near the.win
dow which ehe had tried to reach. The
position of the tiny corpse told the story
plainly of the child's struggle to save
herself.
Frank Costa, .father of Mrs. Ferreira,
residing at 656 J /S) .Kennedy street," also in
humble circumstances, has taken the
stricken, daughter, her surviving baby
and the husband to his home, where
they will remain until they can rehabi
litate themselves. Mrs. Ferreira was talk
ins .with Mary Costa, her sieter, over the
back fence that separated the two houses
when the fire broke out. The frantic
mother saved her baby, who was in a
carriage in the back yard, but she could
not press through the flames, try as she
would, to reech the sleeping children in
the burninc house.

OAKLAND, Aug., 6.â The first steps to
give Oakland a harmonious system of
parks -will be taken by tne City Council
to-morrow night, when It is hoped they
â¢will proceed with an appropriation of
$50,000 J or the filling of the park site
south of the Twelfth street dam. City
Engineer Turner has ueclded that the
park site belongs to the city without de
fect of title, and has cleared the way for
this magnificent improvement.
This section of land, which is half
filled and partly under water at high
tide, has always been an eyesore to the
city. By simply dredging Lake Merritt.
which in itself is a much needed im
provement, and pumping the mud over
this section the foundation for a beauti
ful park can be made.
This will be the beginning of a chain of
parks that will reach from the Sixteentn
street depot in West Oakland to Inde
pendence square, East Oakland, and to
Bushrod Park in North Oakiand. These
parks when finished will make Oakland
one of the show cities of California,' and
to this end every member,of the adminis
tration, both legislative and executive, is
earnestly working."
"This city ought to be called the Park
City," says Mayor Mott. "and if we can
only make a beginning I am sure we can
have a system so nearly completed in the
next two years that it will take very lit
tle to complete it. \u25a0 The natural begin
ning is this section just south of Twelfth
street, and when this is started we" pro
pose to begin work on the marsh by the
depot in "West Oakland, on. Independence
square and up on Bushrod Park. In do-
Ing this we are merely developing what
we already have, and are not buying new
properties. The entire administration is
earnest in its desire to do something to,
beautify the city."

Active control of the yellow fever situ
ation in New Orleans by the United
States public health and marine hospital
service will begin immediately. Orders
to that effect were wired to-night to Sur
geon J. H. White, the marine hospital
officer now on duty in that city. These
orders followed the receipt from Dr.
White during the day of several tele
grams, which showed that the citizens
of New Orleans had promised thef?
hearty and unrestricted co-operation in
the work to be undertaken by the Fed
eral Government, and, would meet certain
financial requirements imposed by the
marine hospital service as a preliminary
to assuming the respons.->llity. Antici
pating this outcome of the situation, Dr.
White already had determined upon ten
tative plans for the work in hand. The
city will be divided Into wards and each
ward will be placed in . charge of a. re
sponsible and experienced surgeon of the
marine : hospital service, who will have
absolute control of the locality. Already
Surgeon General Wyman has given direc
tions to a number of Marine Hospital
surgeons to proceed to New Orleans for
assignment to work under Dr. White.
These are all officers who have had ex
perience dealing with yellow fever epi
demics. ' .- â¢ â¢; .
SHAW GIVES APPROVAL.
Secretary Shaw's reply to-day was as
follows:
I think you are^ proceeding: properly not
withstanding conflicting reports. Promptly ad
vise the name, general description of master
Of every private vessel placed at your dis
posal. .-We will then give authority which will
doubtless protect. There may be some ques
tion about your authority to arrest vessels
and to take them to Ship Island, but there can
be no doubt of- your authority to prevent both
vessel? and persons leaving the Infected dis
trict. I have directed Captain Ross to proceed
to New Orleans and exercise general super
vision over his branch of the service.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6.â Secretary
Shaw to-day telegraphed Captain E. C.
Chayter of the revenue cutter Winona
sustaining the latter's action in the en
forcement of the yellow fever quarantine
between Mississippi and Louisiana and
giving some general instructions. The
dispatch is in reply to one from Captain
Chayter saying the friction between the
two States has become serious and ask
ing for an official dennition of the reve
nue cutter's authority.
Surgeon White returned to-day from
Gulfport and Ocean Springs, where he
had gone tb arrange for the improving of
the camp at Fontainebleau, on the Louis
ville and Nashville road, and stated that
he would probably not establish any
camp on the Mississippi coast in view of
the attitude of the people of Ocean
Springs and Governor Vardaman's ex
pressed determination to abide by their
wishes. The camps at Slidell and Wicken
will be enlarged to accommodate such
travelers as would have gone over to a
camp on the Mississippi coast.
OYSTER BAY, N. V., Aug. 6.â For his
prompt . action in extending Government
aid to the citizens of New Orleans and of
the State of Louisiana in lighting the
epidemic of yellow fever President Roose
velt to-day received the' thanks of the
citizens' committee in the form of the
following telegram:
NEW ORLEANS, rf^a.. August 6.â The Pres
ident, Oyster Bay. L. L: We heartily thank
you for your prompt and generous action,
\u25a0which, although expected, was nevertheUss
gratlfyln?. We pledge ourselves to do our
share -and have wired Surgeon General Wy
man that we would secure and furnish all the
funds the service -required.
President Roosevelt and Surgeon
General Wyman have been wired by
the citizens' committee of New Orleans
that all the funds that the service may
require oiitside of its own stated ex
penditures will be supplied by the peo
ple of the city. This action was taken
at noon at a special meeting of the
finance committee held in the St.
Charles Hotel.
to exLarge camps.
NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 6. â Fever re
port up to 6 p. m.:
New cascn, 2S. Tofnl cases to date,
533. Deaths, 8. Total death* to date,
105. .Yen Muk-foci, 2. Total sub-foul
to date, U3.
The fever report to-day is a great
improvement over those during the
middle of the week and the fact that
there were only two new sub-foci, one
uptown,, anfi one downtown, is a source
of special encouragement. An effort is
being made to determine the number of
cases of fever N under treatment and, al
lowing ten days, which is a liberal
estimate for a patient to either recover
or die. it is figured out that there arc
now 233 cases under treatment. The
Marine Hospital Service has not yet> as
sumed control of the local situation,
but it is expected to do so to-morrow.
The conditions- precedent to their_as
sumption, however, that the citizens of
New Orleans pledge themselves to put
up $2.10,000, to defray the cost of labor
and material, has been met and Sur
geon White is in momentary expecta
tion of receiving the formalorder from
Surgeon General Wyman to take
charge.

HAVANA. Aug. 6.-Jose Miguel Gomez.
Governor ;of Santa Clara province, and,
Liberal candidate for the Presidency of
Cuba, has given out an interview full oC
defiance to the Palma Government. With
reference to the Vueltas case and the
Cuban Government's assumption of the
right to inspect municipalities, without
reference to the provincial authorities.
Governor Gomez says: \u25a0
I will not allow any oner excepting thÂ« pro
vincial authorities to Inspect the municipalities
of thia province. . Should a municipality bo grov.
erned by Moderates I would refuse to consent
to this procedure just the same and would de

He said that of the force of 3000 rural
guards half were Inwardly in his favor.
Military officers absolutely deny thia
statement and say that the only company
of rural guards in which disaffection was
shown was that of Santa Clara province,
now removed, to Havana, the captain of
which resigned to avoid being disgraced.
The Moderates profess satisfaction at
Gomez's statement, which they term sÂ«d
sational and reckless, and which, they as
sert, will certainly defeat him. as the
Cubans will never elect a President who
has defied the court 3 or sought to incul

She was picked up unconscious and
taken to the Park Emergency Hospital.
There she soon revived, but her power
of memory was gone. She knew nothing
of the accident and she could not under
stand why she was there.
Miss Sherman asserts that sfie heard
no bell from the oncoming car. She says 1
that it -was coming very fast. Both
women got off on the wrong side. Dr.
Stevens, who attended the woman, pro
nounces her condition serious.
Strange to relate, the blow from the
speeding car has produced a concussion
of the brain that has destroyed her pow
er' of memory, and she. lies there on the
iron cot reasking questions that have
been answered her many times over. ".
"Why am I here?" she demands -of the
nurse in attendance or of her friend. Miss
Anna Sherman, who sits faithfully by
her side. Patiently they tell her, and at
that she is satisfied for t.Â»e time being.
Then a moment later she flashes out the
question, "Why am I here This is not
my home. Take me there."
\u25a0 With loving tenderness the nurse or
Miss Sherman assures her that she is in
good hands and relates the story of the
accident to her. The same satisfied look
comes for a moment, then again the
question. Thus far into the night Mrs.
Snyder. sought to fix the one idea perma
nently, in her troubled brain, but to no
avail..! She had. lost her power of mem
ory as completely as if every event had
been blotted out of her life, and at last
she fell asleep from sheer exhaustion.
The concussion has probably left a
blood clot on the brain, which must be
removed before Mrs. 1 Snyder will regain
the full use of her mind. The operation
has been often accomplished, but it is a
dangerous one.
The accident happened on the car line
just below the Cliff House. Mrs. Snyder,
a young woman who has been employed
with the Goldberg-Bowen .Company, was
riding out to the beach to enjoy the holi
day, as was her .wont" on Sunday after
noons. With her was Miss Sherman, a
friend who lives in the same apartments
at; 110 Hyde street. Miss Sherman got off
the car first, crossing the adjoining track.
Mrs. Snyder was just behind her, but as
she stepped on the. track a car headed
downtown crashed into her, throwing her
to one side.
Mrs. Bertha Snyder lies bruised and
torn in the white ward of the Park
Emergency Hospital, her head arid arms
swathed in soothing liniments and
bandages, the : result of stepping from
one car directly in the path of another
moving: rapidly in -the opposite direc
tion at the Cliff House yesterday after
noon.

13 tho unusual in business life.
A successful public speaker has a
reason for every move he makes whiro
addressing an audience.
Soon after John H. Patterson, presi
dent of the National Cash ResfcJter
Company, returned to Dayton after a
trip around the world he addressed his
employes on the subject of promotions.
It was soon after lunch and.somÂ« of
those present appeared to lose interest
iv hia talk.
Mr. Patterson asked for a glass of
water. It was brought and placed ou a
table in front of him. He did not drink
it, but continued to talk. He as^tn
turned and asked for some water. SAn
] attendant brought a pitcher of water
and placed it on the table. Mr. Patter
son continued to talk on promotions.
i As he made a telling point hÂ« pushed
acrainst the table and down went
pitcher, glass and all. The. crash
startled every one in the room, many
jumping up out of their seats, thinking
that Mr. Patterson had met with an
accident. He had the attention of
every one in the room. With a smile ,
he resumed:
"1 wanted to do something unusual.
You will remember that breaking the
pitcher of all th* things I did to-day.
You would huvc forgotten all about our
having a meetinsr to-day, and of our
talk on promotions, and therefore you
would not have got any good oul

this: 'Why. what do you think Mr.

'Why. lie stood un. there and Just
knocked over a table with a pitcher of
water and a glass on It. I saw him.
and was going to warn him. but I tva3
too late. The water was all over the
table and all over the floor. . I saw it
going over, but did not yell because it
was all done so quickly.' 'What was he
talking about?' 'Re was telling. us how
we could win promotion, how wo could
all make more money. Some of us were
a little bit sleepy after "c hearty din
ner and he wanted to wake us up and
make us remember the part about pro
motions. He said that thÂ« pitcher, cost
only 75 cents, and the reason he broke
it was to do toma of the men' 175

wanted to succeed financially, morally,

could do so by resisting temptations of

WHY HE BROKE THE PITCHER.
THE MOON-K. A. P.. Burnt Ranch.
Cal. The moon always presents the same
facfc to us, as is evident from the per
manency of the various markings on its
surface. This circumstance proves that
with respect to the earth she revolves on
an axis, . and the time of rotation is
exactly eaual to the time of revolution
around the earth, via.. 27.82166 days. The
moon'Â» axis is not perpendicular to the
plane of Her orbit, but deviates therefrom
by an anclo of about 6 degrees 41
minutes. In consequence of this fact.
and cf the inclination of tha lunar .orbit
to that of the ecliptic, the poles of the
moon Uan alternately to and from the,
earth. When the north pole leans to

MR. TIMOTHY SPELLACY, a fine man is he, is chairman of
the State Democratic Committee, and works at it some. He
is also an optimist, and works at it a good deal. He is out
with a plan for uniting the party. Any one will admit that to be
a long-felt want. The two wings have not flopped together for so
long that they have learned to fly separately and have lost the fac
ulty of co-ordination. There is a classic fable that man and woman
were once united in the same person.
The gods were mad at something this joint person did. and
clove them all in twain, since wtaicn the two halves have been madly
rushing around to find each other. In this the two halves of the
Democracy have no resemblance to this cloven man. Instead of
rushing into each other's arms, they race the other way. Mr. Spel
lacy wants to bring them together, and thinks it can be done. For
this purpose he proposes that they unite on a platform of Federal
ownership of railroads, telegraphs and telephones, and State and
municipal ownership of a large number of other thing?. He is well
assured that the Jefferson Democracy can find felicity in its own
arms upon a platform like that.
We are not the physician in the case, but as an admiring
friend we beg to assure Mr. Spellacy that it will not work. Thomas
Jefferson himself would hire a team to carry him far from a party
like that. His distinguishing characteristic was that he wanted the
activities of government restricted rather than extended. Indeed,
he said that the polity of the Indian tribes was a good model for
that of governments for white man. He believed in every man do
ing what he pleased, and a good deal of it, so -long as he did not
interfere with another man who was doing .the same thing.
t-ii-f-If he did interfere it was the business of the Government to
stop him, and not take his job loff his hands. Mr. Spellacy /wants
the Government to quit governing and go into trade. Some one
should introduce him to the principles "of -Jefferson. If the next
campaign is made upon the platform he wants, there will be 4
bigger bolt from the party than ever.
We have no desire to throw cold water on the platform of this
genial gentleman, but merely to speak of it as a friend of consis
tency. . â¢ . . ' V -\u25a0\u25a0

One day -the longing for Chicago
seized Gustaf. He could not rest until
he should have seen l,ake MichiÃriut
again. He arranged for a short vaca
tion and packed his suit case in record
breaking time. He would not even tell
David that he was coming. Ho would
go home first. Then he would go down
to the theater and wait for David and
bring him back with him. His mother
would have a little supper for. the three
of them to celebrate his homecoming.
â¢ As he rang the bell of th-3 little
house he was aglow with Joy. Ills
mother opened the door and after a
cry of surprise caught him in mn em
brace of happiness. Then from the par
! lor came David. "It only needed. you,"
j said Gufttaf. "to make my pleasure corn
i plete."
They talked long. of Gustaf's success,
of his experiences, of his impressions
of Cincinnati.
"Perhaps I can get you a Job down
there, David." said Gustaf,' "if you
would like to take it."
-Well." said David slowly. "I'm
I pretty well satisfied with Chicago.
I You see, I'm married."
I "Married!" cried Gustaf. "Atitf you
( never told me!"
j David looked somftwhat abashed.
i "Did you know it, mother?" Gustaf
asked.
i "Oh. yes." said hi." mother. "You see,
j David married me."
Â»-T"< HE friendship of Gustaf and David
I began when they wore both play
\u25a0*â¢ ing in the samo orchestra at one
of the downtowu theaters. David was
a 6tranger in Chicago and eagerly
accepted the cordial invitation that
Gustaf extended to him to visit at his
home. Gustafs mother was n grdy
haircd woman, who warmly seconded
the liking of her . son for the young
man.
The two violinists became insepar
able companions. They practiced to
gether, while Gustafs mother accom
panied them on the little cottage
organ. They went out together. They
planned together and they dreamed to
gether.
One day an offer came to (Justaf to
joiu an orchestra in Cincinnati. The
salary was a tempting one. But he
hesitated to leavÂ« home. L<ong and
earnestly he discussed the advantages
and disadvantages of the change with
David.
â¢What would you aÂ«" vise me to do?"
he asked his friend.
"The salary is a good one," . said
David.
"But my mother cannot come with
me. She owns her house here unj she
could not leave it now."
"Could she not. sell the house?" in
quired Duvld.
"Perhaps.. But that will take time.
In the meantime she will bo here alona
and 1 will be in Cincinnati alone.
David, you will go to see her often
when 1 am away?"
Solemnly did David promise. Gustaf
went away with a lig-nter heart, hap
pier in thÂ« knowledge that David
would do all he could to prevent his
mother from missing him tyo sorely.
His mother's letters, coining to him at
the regular weekly interval, reassured
him of any fears he might have for
her complete loneliness. The neigh
bors were woodw 'ood \u25a0to hex. David came to
see her occasionally, k man waa look
ing at the house and thought^ that he
might purchase it. in the summer. Gus
taf. thinking that his mother would
probably be with him next winter, was
glad, if only- David would bÂ« there.

t -r tITH the approach of autumn comes a more pronounced nn-
W provemenf and expansion in trade, manifested in various
" V ways. First, crop prospects, cc^ton exceptcd, have de
cidedly improved during the past week or so, fears of rust damage
to the spring wheat having largely subsided, while the corn crop
bids fair to be a record-breaker. The weather over the major pan
of the cotton belt has been so unfavorable thus far that the yield will
fall much below that of last year, even with good conditions from
now on. Estimates now range in the vicinity of 9,000,000 bales as
this season's crop, against about 13,500,000 bales last year. But
last year's crop was extremely large.
These good corn and wheat prospects have removed the only
drawback to the outlook for the regular fall trade, and the benefi
cent effects are already visible in an improving demand for manu
factures and general merchandise. Fall business, especially in the
Western grain districts, is opening a week ahead of last year, with
a good buying demand everywhere. The manufacturers of the
East report* a steady increase in orders, while the usual midsummer
dullness, as already mentioned, is less pronounced than usual. Im
proved collections are reported as an effect of these bright condi
tions. /
The regular statistics affirm the general trade improvement.
The failures last week were 223, against 230 for the corresponding
week in 1904, while the railway earnings in July were 9.1 per cent
' larger than in July of that year. The bank clearings for July broke
all records for that month and made tlfeir usual brilliant exhibit last
week, only four out of the forty first cities on the list showing a
decrease as compared with 1904. Some of the gains were very
large, such as 51.6 per cent at New York, 95.5 at New Orleans, 39.7
at Omaha, 33.5' at Pittsburg, 41. 1 at Philadelphia, 19.5 at Chicago.
23.2 at San Francisco, 21.4 at Boston, 52.6 at Los Angeles, 48.5 at
Memphis, 82.7 at Tacoma, 75.8 at Seattle, 61.1 at Augusta, Ga., 54.2
at Galveston, and so on. The list might fre" more fully extended,
but the figures already given cover all sections of the country and
attest without exception the general prosperity of the nation. The
aggregate clearings themselves were large, being $2,520,000,000.
Supplementary to these figures is the excellent showing of the
great staples. The footwear factories are doiiig a large business,
and the demand for hides and leather is so vast and urgent that
quotations for the former are rising all over the world, while the
market is getting excited. Wool is in lively demand and very strong,
cotton shows marked buoyancy, with rising prices for future deliv
ery, and the dry goods market, following cotton and wool, is active
and in good condition. Provisions rule firm at the Western packing
centers, though the markets are not especially active. The only
unfavorable report comes from the bituminous coal districts, where
excessive competition is causing low quotations for the coal.
Money shows no change, unless, it be a weakening in interest
rates, caused by the oversupply of cash everywhere. Speculation
on the New York Stock Exchange is dull, as usual at this tinie of
the year, but the undertone of the market is firm and quotations
keep up to their high level, with not much fluctuation. There has
lately been an increasing demand for low-priced stocks.
On the Pacific Coast the conditions continue flattering. While the
grain and fruit crops are not turning out as heavy as expected several
months ago, the loss in quantity is more than offset by the high
prices being obtained by the farmers and* fruit-growers, so the net
result is favorable. The dried fruit market is advancing right along,
not even excepting prunes, which have gone up 100 per cent during
the past month, with confident expectations of still higher prices.
This important industry, so long at a low ebb, is now again on a
profitable basis. Wool, hops, hides, wheat, barley, oats, dairy prod
ucts, and, in fact, almost every product of the farm, are bringing
much more than the normal returns, and in consequence the farmer
is enjoying an extended period of exceptional prosperity.
There is no abatement in the demand for real estate, both city
and country, while building operations in San Francisco and the
other cities and towns of the coast are sjo "active that they are at
tracting widespread attention. In brief, no matter in what direc
tion we look, we sec a general trade and agricultural activity inspir
ing the whole community, with continued confidence in the future.

WOMAN IN ARIZONA
KILLS HER HUSBAND
Family Quarrel Comes to a
Tragic Climax in
Special Dispatch to The Call
TOKIO, Aug. 6.â Commander Akyama,
who. participated in the battle of Japan,
has prepared for publication an extended
statement relating to the great conflict,
and its weight is pn the side of gunnery,
the battleships and tactics as against the
destroyer and the torpedo. " i; ,
lie prefaces his statement by declaring
that good gunnery depends mainly upon
the division officers and asserts that the
Russian officers were lamentably lacking
in training.
â¢ In the early part of the battle the Rus
sians scored but one hit to three landed
by the Japanese. Under ' these circum
stances it may be said that the Japanese
had three or four guns in action to every
one of the Russians, and there was noth
ing very remarkable about the disparity
in the losses. \u25a0 â¢;
The admiral says that Admiral Rojest
vensky had been criticized for electing
to take his chance's at the Tushima. On
the contrary, it was the wisest course
open to him. Tsugara Strait is long and
narrow, the season was foggy and there
were mechanical obstructions. Distance
and coal were against Soya and the time
consumed in reaching that entrance
would have betrayed the design, and. his
plight on emerging from Soya would have
been much worse than he might reason
ably hope for at Tushima.
Regarding the question of pinking ar
mored cruisers and battleships by gun
fire, the commander expresses the opinion
that the fact that the Russian- ships were
exceptionally low in the water contribut
ed materially to the result. The Rus
sians carried large quantities of coal,
stores and ammunition, artd, thus weight
ed down and- In a rough sea, suffered
badly from hits near the water line that
ordinarily would not have been fatal.
The commander says that the battle
did not, as some claim, prove the su-.
perlorlty of â¢ arms to armor. He points
out that the newest armor on the Rus
sian ships, notably In the case of the
Orel, was not pierced. . . :
Okyama defends Nebogatoff's surrender
from severe criticism. Nebogatoff was
surrounded by twenty-seven ship?, . in
cluding the most powerful of Togo's fleet.
Had the Russian refused to surrender his
ships would have been sunk forthwith.
Five or ten minutes would have sufficed,
to finish the unpleasant task. Any other'
course than 'surrender would have con-,
demned the needless death of 2000 officers
and men. '
Accurate estimates of the actual Rus
sian casualties are Impossible to obtain,
but they are far under first estimates.'
The rescued and surrendered exceed
7000 and. making due allowances for those
who escaped in the Almaz, Lazumrud.
Orel, Aurora, Jemtchug . and the aux
iliaries, the number actually lost is some
where between 2000 and 3000.

: PHOENIX. Ariz., Aug. -6.â Thursday
night Mrs. Henry Savage of Bisbee
blew off the top of her husband's head
with a shotgun, firing,' through the win
dow at him as he approached the house.
She had ordered him to halt and here
fused. A son by. a former husband was
at, her eide with another gun, but she
told him not to shoot for her aim had
been true. A revolver was found in one
of the dead man's pockets and a bottle
of whisky in the other. The woman
gave herself up and said she was glad
her husband was dead.
The story is the" usual one of a family
row. . Sava&e quarreled with his step
sons, who were erecting a laundry
building alongside the residence prop
erty., to which he objected. Mrs. Sav
age says he has treated her cruelly,
often threatening to kill her. : Only a

\u25a0house with: her nine-month-old baby
and she spent the night on . the hill
side, afraid to go home. She says her

The resources and possibilities of the
colony of New Zealand as a food-pro
ducing country promises so much that It
Is without any apology that the Gov
ernment desires to bring It under the no
tice of those interested in transporting,
importing and otherwise handling 1 the
foodstuffs of the world.
As a market In which to procure sup
plies of raw material, the annual export
of wool, hemp, skins and hides, kauri
gum and coal have only to be mentioned
to induce purchasers of the staples to
attend and investigate the source of pro
duction. While the mineral wealth is
demonstrated by an increasing output of
gold, which during the last fifty . years,
ha 3 totaled in value the \u25a0 immense sum
of Â£65,000,000.
1 The Government of New Zealand has
j decided to hold, during the summer of
i IDOO-7, an international exhibition at
â¢Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand,
iin which all the nations of the
| world have been invited to par
j ticipate. The object of the exhibi
i tion is educational, and it is intend
\ ed to demonstrate the resources and pos
sibilities of the colony as one of the
world's fobd-prodilclng factors, its vast
mineral resources and to draw attention
to its unrivaled and varied scenery,
thermal wonders, and also the excep
tional opportunities offered to sportsmen;
and, further and specially, to bring un
der the notice of the more industrial na
tions of the world the great field the
colony of New Zealand offers as an out
let for enterprise and for the use and
consumption of- all manner of up-to-date
appliances, manufactures, etc.
Such an exhibition should command
the support and attention of all the
manufacturing nations of the world, and,
if taken advantage of, must accomplish
tangible and satisfactory results. The
colony of New Zealand, being essentially
a producing country, offers a splendid
cutlet for the manufactures of other
countries which pay more attention to
the development of manufacturing in
dustries and whose industrial conditions
and facilities -are better adapted to the
promotion and development of manufac
turing, v
,The imports of the colony for the last
year (at least three-fourths of; which are
manufactured goods) amount to Â£13,
292.000.
When it Is considered that this im
mense, expenditure on imports is re
quired for the use and consumption of a
colony with a population of 550,(*0 per
sons It can readily be understood what a
rare opportunity there is for exploiting
this colony with up-to-date manufactures.
These features of the possibilities of
the exhibition are confidently placed be
fore the more industrial nations of the
world. Therefore manufacturers are
urged to appoint representatives and to
send such exhibits as will show the na
ture and finish of their work and which
are suitable for a colony that is pro
gressing with . almost unparalleled rap
idity, and which has the keenest desire
to adopt* the most modern ideas and con
veniences of advanced civilization.
NO APOLOGY FOR RESOURCES.
At 8:25 this morning word came from
the Jury room*that a verdict had been
reached and Judge Davis convened a spe
cial session of court to hear the result.
The acquittal was greeted with cheers
by the friends of Senator Farrls and the
latter was warmly congratulated.
The trial had lasted for a week, the
principal testimony for the State being
that of former Lieutenant Governor John
A. Lee, on whose testimony beiore the
Grand Jury indictments were returned
against Farris and former Senator C. A.
Smith. It was arranged to-day that the
application for a change of venue In the
case of Smith.be withdrawn, as it is re
garded that the acquittal of Farrls pre-,
eludes the possibility of a conviction in
the Smith case, as the charges In each
instance were identical. The Smith case
will be taken up before Judge Martin
and It Js announced will be dismissed by
the State.
- The jury retired to consider a verdict
at 9:33 last night. The first ballot re
sulted eight for . acquittal and four for
conviction. The same result continued
on, subsequent ballots and the Jury was
locked up for the night at 11:30.

OYSTER BAY.- Aug. 6.â President
Roosevelt late this afternoon delivered
a lay sermon to the Christian Brother
hood of Oyster Bay. He emphasized
especially the necessity of sound char
acter-building, holding that high moral
character \was the real essence : of
Christian life. The organization before
which the President spoke is a non
sectarian body,, composed principally
of the male members of the sevtral lo
cal churches.
The President, in beginning his ad
dress, read selections from the sixth
chapter of Matthew, the Epistle to the
Corinthians and the Epistle by James.
No verbatim report of the address was
made, but the President to-night dic
tated the following as the substance of
his remarks:
Brother Bowman has spoken of the fact that
I have had a large experience. I think that
each one of us who has a large experience
grows to realize more and more that the es
sentials of experience are alike for all of us.
The things that move us most, the thinss of
the home, of the church, | the intimate rela
tions that knit a man to his family, to his
clOÃe triends, that make him try to do his
duty to his neighbor, by.hia God, are in their
essentials just the same tor one man as for
another, provided the man is in good faith
trying to do his duty. I feel that ihe progress
of our country really deoends upon the sum
of the efforts of the Individuals acting by
themselves, but especially upon the sum of
the efforts of the individuals acilnsr In asso
ciations like this for the betterment of them
selves, for the betterment of the communities
In which they dwell. There Is never tny dif
ficulty about the forces of evil beincr or
ganized. Every time that we get an ortjamzH
tion of the forces that ai* â¢valnfMltv Â«irlvtne
for good,' an organization llks this, we arÂ«
doing our part to onset unl Â«iU.-j ...0.. .
offset the torces of evil.
I want to read several different texts which
it seems to me have especial bear.ug upon the
work of brotherhoods like this, upon the- spirit
In which not only all of us who are mem
bers cf this brotherhood, but all ot us who
strive to be decent Christians are to aDti'y
our Christianity on week days as well as on
Sundays. The first verses I want to rea-J
Can be found in the seventh chapter ct' Mat
thew, the first, sixtee.v.lv f-svcnieenth and
eighteenth verses:
First â "Judge not, that ye be not Judged."
Sixteenth â "Ye shall know them by their
fruits. Do men rather grapes of thorns or
figs of thistles?" Seventeenth â "Evtn so every
good tree brinseth forth good fruit, but a
corrupt tree brlngeth torth evil fruit."
Eighteenth â "A good tree cannot bring forth
evil fruit, neither can . a corrupt tree bring
forth L'O'i.l fruit."
"Judge not, that ye be not judged"; that
means treat each of your hrothers vÂ»itn char
ity. He not quick to find fault. Above all.
be not quick to judge another man, who. ac
cording to his light, is striving to do his duty
as eacb of us here hopes he is striving tv
do his.
. Let us ever remember that not only we have
divine - authority lor the statement that ' by
our fruits we shall be known, but that also
it is true that mankind will tend to Judge us
by our fruits. It Is an especially lamentable
thine to see 111 done by any man, who from
his associations with the. church; who, from
the fact that he. has had the priceless benefits
of the teachings of the Christian religion,
should be expected to take a position of lead
ership in the work lor Rood.
The next quotation I wish' to read' to you
is found In the twenty-fifth chapter of Mat
thow, th:rty-seventh to fortieth verses, In
clusive: . '
"Then shall the righteous answer him. say-
Ing, Lord, when saw we thee and hungered,
and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
"When saw we thee a stranger and took
thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
"Or when saw we thee sick, or In prison,
and came unto thee? â¢
"And the King shall answer and say unto
them. Verily I say unto you, â¢ Inasmuch as ye
have done- It unto one of the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
That is what this brotherhood means, by
trying to worship our Creator, by acting to
ward his creatures as he would have us act,
to try- to make our religion a driving force
In our lives, <to do unto others as we would
have them ' to do unto us. '
" The next text I ' wish to read Is found in
the First Corinthians, thirteenth chapter, be
ginning with the first verÂ»^: '.
- "Though I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels, and ! have not charity, I am
become as pounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
"And though I have the gift of prophecy and
.understand all mysteries, and all knowledge;
and though I have all faith, so that I could
remove mountains, and have not charity. I
am nothing.
"And though I bestow all my goods to feed
the poor; and though 1 give my body to be
burned and have not charity, it proflteth me
nothing.
"Charity Buffereth long and is kind; charity
envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is
not puffed up."
"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these
three; but the greatest of these Is charjty."
Let each of us exercise' the largest toler
ance for his brother who Is trying, though in
a different way, to lead a decent life, who Is
trying to do good In his own fashion; let each
try to show practical sympathy with that
brother not be too quick to criticize.
In closing. l want to read Just a few verses
from the epistle of James from the first chap
ter, twenty-seventh verse:
"Pure religion and undeflled before God and
the Father Is this. To visit the fatherless and
widows In their affliction and to keep him
self unspotted from the world." ~\t f -
If a man will. try to serve God the Father
by being kindly to the man around him who
needs his kindness and by being upright and
honest himself, then we have the authority
of the good- book for saylngr that we_ are
in honor bound to treat him as a good Chris
tian and extend the hand of brotherhood to
him. , . '-.' ' ''\u25a0'\u25a0-\u25a0'. :

Bis Surprint? In Sprunsr on the Fol-
lowers of Uamc at California
" Courts.
Two feature .matches were played on
the California Tennis Club courts yester
day. In one Carl Gardiner met Herbert
Schmidt, and in the other George Busch,
who recently won the championshlo of
the Northwest at Portland, and Frank
Mitchell came together. In the first Gar
diner showed a return to the form which
won him the championship of San Fran
cisco in May. He started off with the
same falling off in effectiveness of play
which he had shown over since that
event, losing the first set, -2-6 v After that
he was all himself again, and had per
feet command of his strokes, driving,
smashing, \u25a0 chopping and volleying with
equal brilliancy and accuracy, and hav
ing the speedy Schmidt at a disadvan
tage in every style of play. He won the
next four sets almost as he pleased, the
score being 6-2, 6-3, 6-0 and S-6. the latter
being the only one in which Schmidt
made any showing.
The second match furnished a surprise,
Mitchell handily taking Busch into camp.
It was the latter's first appearance since
his return, laden with laurels from the
Northwest, and he hardly did himself
justice. His forehand drive was his m^st
effective stroke, and even with that he
was not sure of himself. At the net and
with his back-hand stroke lie was away
off in his piny. Although he has not beon
or. the courts much for several we<jks,
Mitchell played good ten:i:s, and dis
posed of the champion handily.
For ..lower, class men, IZ. E. Punnett
end F." Black put up a good ar f . : cle of
tennis in a' two-set match. In which each
won a set, the score being 6-4 and 3-6.
Gt-orge Cutler beat Punnett two rtraight
sets, 6-4 and 6-G. .
Next Sunday a handicap doubles tour
ram* nt will be held on- the . California
C!ul> courts. On the following Sunday
a class singles for all four clashes will
ba held. Entries for the dmbics will
close on Bunday morning, and for, the
doubles on the 19th.
On the park courts the feature of the
day was a challenge doubles match* be
tween Charles Foley and R. N Whitne.v
and George Baker and C. Dunlap. The
first named pair, feeling that they dM
not do themselves justice in the recent
doubles tournament, sought a match with
the winners of the event, playing them
on even terms tnd winning easily in threu
straight sets by a score of rt-1, 'J-2, C-2.

broke 94" birds, which is probably the
best score made by local gunmen this
season. -In the shoot for tho Bekeart
trophy he. again showed his merit by
shattering 92 of the clay birds out of a
possible hundred.
Shultz shot in good form, getting 88
birds in the champion class and a like
number, in Bekeart shoot. Wattles
scored 79 breaks in the race. for gun
men jOf 'the first class, and this was a
high 'score. â¢

was high gun with 70 birds. Harvey
was shooting at his best, and his score
of 81 birds in-the'thirirl class. indicates

One of the best bettlns races during
the day was the trial between Judge,

put it through if the hounds had not
been slipped to a tartar of a hare, which

for the younger dog, and she finally woa

Old Para Van Haltren managed to
steer his bunch of Commuters to vic

the day -was yet young, but the vie

just one run when it hooked up with
the Giants at Recreation Park. No one
knew how the same would finish till
Bull Croll was thrown out at the pan
in the last spasm by Deacon Van
Buren.
* The grame abounded In scratch hits
and close decisions. Men were getting
on the bags time and time again, but
the hits were always lacking When full
houses were the rule. Many times the
pame might have been broken up by
either team, but most of these oppor
tunities were passed up for the want
of the Inevitable binjle.
The Commuters managed to grab
eight safe ones from the collection of
the lengthy Mr. Garvin, while the beet
the Giants got was three. However.
one of these came with a full house
and Schmidts inability to discover the !
location of the home plate helped some

Croll, who tore off six real ones out of
cix times up in the two games. He led
eff with two in the morning and came
right back with four in the afternoon.
Oakland started with one in the first
when Van Haltren was passed and
Francks singled. Van Haltren raced
k through as Van Buren tossed wide at
third. "The Giants did not register till
" the fifth when with all the bags occu
pied and two gone Jakey Atz walloped

McCreedie was banished from the scene
of action for passing too many remarks
about a close decision at flrst in which
Conrad was retired.
The Giants brought another around

HESULTS OF GAMES.
| The rifle range at Schuetzen Park was
j not crowded with marksmen yesterday,
as is usual on the iirst Sunday of the
month. Many of the enthusiasts arc ex
ploiing the mountains of Marin, Siyioma
and Mendocino counties in pursuit of the
elusive buck and are meeting with
marked aucctss.
I Q. A. Bremer, the well-known expert of
the California Schuetzen Club, ca?ried
j off the honors of the day with the good
'score of 225 rings in his ten-shot score.
, A. C. Gehret and A. Strecker were hot on
j his. heels to overcome his lead, but lacked
i one point each of tying his good score.
I A. C. Gehret with 220 rings was high in
I the Grutll Club contest, with Ar Studer
second with 211. In the same club A.
Hintemann won the Brehm" trophy.
An innovation by the California
Schuetzen Club is the pleasant outing
that has been arranged for the families
of members of the club and their imme
diate friends. -The affair is a ; compli
mentary one arid will be held at Schuetz
en Park next Sunday.* Scores:

~So much- for what. has actually been
traced to the "Jim "Crow gang." Al
though without any direct ..evidence as
a basis. Sheriff Barnet "strongly sus
pects -.this jrang responsible for. . the
death of Policeman George Brown,
who was shot to death on the evening
of December 17" last year. This was
just at the time that the "Jim Crow
gang" was operating 1 most \u25a0' actively,
ami there is good reason to bejleve that
theso desperate young criminals, who
would not stop at murder to get Cook's
$200. would not stop at the- murder, of
a policeman if they felt- that they ; were
in danger.
There never has. been any good de
scription of the assailants of Brown,
and it is not likely that, this, ca.se can
be fastened upon, them unless- they
should coufess. -?\u25a0 - But'; so many, unex-'
plained crimes have ;' been ; connected
with this gang; by_ thelr_ own' confes-'
.pions that the Sheriff's fofllce Is. of. the
opinion that could the whole truth be
obtained it .would^clear^away the mys
tery of the death of Policeman. Brown,
in addition to those of a score of rob
beries, burglaries find . hold-ups.
-As a general '< rule, the "Jim , Crow
gang" preferred a highway robbery or
some daring: assault like that.-upon Mrs.
Nasli in Berkeley^ .They, seemed .to
seek the more .exciting 'exploits. They
have told the officers that' they., had be
gun to think, that theyioould not be de
tected, and after a period of. quiet dur
ing the ; summer. they had planned a se-v

All these stories told by young 1
Crowhurst agree with the stories told
by ' the others, .except, as in
.the case, of the others, he shields
himself as much as. possible. .But
young Crowhurst exhibits more cool^
ness than any of the others, with the
possible exception- of Blaker,' who has
not said a .word. He is'mora seflf-pos-.
sessed than, any of the others, and tells
his story with more clearness and more
attention to detail. . . \u25a0. \u25a0:â¢.."
One of the first cases he took part in
was with his brother on October 13 of
last year. They held up A. H. Guldice
in Lafayette Park, just behind the high
school. Guidlce was with a young lady
and the elder Crowhurst placed a re
volver,under his nose' while the younger
searched his pockets. All that they found
was 35 cents whereat the elder Crowhurst
became wrathy and searched the man a
second time himself. "When no more
money materialized he said to Guldice,
"You're a cheap guy, anyway, to go out
with a girl with only 35 cents In your
pockets." Guldice had a considerable
amount of money in an inside pocket.
Another case that young Crowhurst has
confessed to is the holdup of a man by
the name of Goody, as nearly as he could
remember. This took place directly across
the street from County Clerk Cook's
house In East Oakland, and a few dol
lars were obtained.-

was available.
Some months, 'ago Chief \u25a0''. Surgeon
Stephen Issued ', ordersv,to r his, assist
ants that drunks must not -be- received
as patients. He says that, at times the
beds which are for _the> use of others
are taken up -by alcoholic patients and
that the police must : cease -making a
dumping ground* out -of .the hospital.
He- says it 'would be necessary, to en
large the hospital ;and put on- another
attendant if thisshould.continue. He
also says-,the drunks are-a menace to
sick patients. ,- They 'are usually dirty
and keep the patients awake.
"The police station is no place for
sick'. people,".; says Lieutenant : Colby,
and this is how. the matter rests.
When Henry regained: part;, of his
senses the police were notified and they
then took him. . â¢\u25a0 V . : \ v ; . .
It would be wise for thosa who in
dulge In cheery stimulants not to mis
judge their 'capacities until Chief Sur
geon Stephen,..and the_ police Officials
can come.tp an agreement.' as to the
proper place to . keep, beastly drunks
who have, lost their senses ,for ; a ;time.
The first, clash cameiearly yesterday
morning when the police . brought to
the Central- Emergency, Hospital 'for
treatment George . Henry, who was
simply unconscious .from" the . excessive
use of alcohol. Such is -the -diagnosis
of Dr. Pinkham, who treated. the man.
Henry was> ordered seat to theVCity
Hall station to^ne locked up. Stewards
Mulally and'Manvllle put their" load" of
human freight on the movable stretch
er and shoved him Into the station office
to be booked for drunkenness. Cor
poral Callinan, who was in charge, re
fused to accept (him as. a prisoner, say
ing that he would not take the re
sponsibility, and he passed j the matter
up to Lieutenant Colby.
Colby likewise refused to book the
man and the two \u25a0 stewards shoved
Henry back tb the hospital." . A sscond
trip was made some time after' in the
hope that they would take th 3 prisoner
for a drunk, but again the police re
fused to" take him. - \u25a0\u25a0 â â¢
Mrs. Nash was at the County. Jail
again to-day, but she Is not positive
about her identification. The other case
was the cracking of the safe of Whitall,
Tatum & Co., glassware manufacturers
of 45 Stevenson street. Crowhurst
worked In the manufactory and one nlglit
slipped back to the works, cracked the
safe, took $300, but left $5000, which h<s
was afraid to touch; and afterward told
the story to his brother. ' -
Elmer Crowhurst to-day told how he
first came to work with the gang. , He
said that his brother wanted some one to
go out with him on a Job one night and
threatened that -he would beat him ' to
death if he did not go. The younger
Crowhurst went and liked the" life so
well that he continued to participate in
FAILS AT IDENTIFICATION.
James Crowhurst was the leader of the
gang. He It was who planned most of
the crimes, worked out the details, got
most of the money, gave his name to the
gang and prepared the badges of their
criminal combination. How Crowhurst
came to escape being in- the Cook holdup
that resulted in a murder no one seems
to know, unless It was that he wanted
to work out the robbery of James Miller,
the pottery man, as his especial business.
This leader of the gang is a locksmith
and. mechanic in a small way. He used
to tour the country as a repairer of
locks, lawn mowers and bicycles. In his
grip that was. supposed to contain topis
ho carried a lot of skeleton keys and two
revolvers. His younger brother generally
accompanied him, and the boy to-day
told the story of several trips through
the country and. robberies that were com
mitted. This grip is now in the pos
session of Sheriff Barnet.
But the older. Crowhurst had an un
fortunate way of \u25a0 boasting about his
deeds, and this has furnished other mem
bers of the gang with information about
him that they have freely given to the
officers. Percy Pembroke has told />â¬
two cases where Crowhurst boasted of
crimes and to-day the younger Crow
hurst substantiated Pembroke's state
ments. One was in the case of Mrs.
IC&sh of Berkeley, who was robbed . In
her own bouse. James Crowhurst showed
clippings about this case to his com
panions and said that he did It. , . â¢
As the case stands now three of the
boys have been connected with the Cook
murder. Nearly all of them have been
connected with one or more hold-ups.
Schneider has been connected with .the
Cook murder, but none of the confessions
show that he had any hand In any of the
other highway robberies that were com
mitted.
"The career of crime of these boys ex
tends over more than * year and Includes
very many robberies of all kinds. They
were regularly banded together with a
definite organization. They planned their
crimes together, and generally two car
ried out the plan. They would then meet
and compare notes as to what they had
done. The very fact that they escaped
detection . for so long maCe them bold,
until they actually committed a murder."
LONG CAREER OF CRIME.
he entertained strong suspicion that the
murder of Policeman George W. Brown
last December was committed by this
youthful band of thugs. From Elmer
Crowhurst he has learned much of the
carnival of crime that the gang carried
on, and while direct evidence is lacking
the Sheriff has hopes that he may ex
tract a confession as to who shot- down
the brave patrolman in the street when
he approached a suspicious character who
\u25a0was lurking" in the darkness.
The younger Crowhurst was taken into
custody this morning by Deputy Sheriff
Tom Carroll. Sheriff Barnet suspected
that the lad, young as he is. had been
implicated in some of the hold-up work
of the gang, and ordered that he be ar
rested. Two hours later me Sheriff had
a statement from the young criminal
that explains several hitherto unsolved
hold-up mysteries of the la?t year. It is
probable that a charge of robbery will be
placed against the lad, but Sheriff Barnet
is disinclined to try to send the boy to
prison, because of his age. and he will
urge sending him to a reform school.
"It is pretty tough to have to collect
evidence of murder and wholesale rob
bery against mere boys," said the Sheriff.
"They are a hard gang, but with all this
mass of criminal evidence against them
they nearly all think of their mothers
and the pain that exposure has caused.

. According to the story told by the sa

tered his place- of business shortly before
4 ' o'clock, and after purchasing several

Borrman says he tried to quiet them,

At 'first the- relatives feared he .had
been the # victim of. foul play and es
pecially as some youths he had haled
up to court for throwing rocks at his
house had, it is' alleged, been heard to
threaten him' harm. However, Detec
tives D. Matheson, G. Mulcahey and'G.
Gorham made, a thorough investigation
of the'neighborhood and concluded that
Murphy had been thrown from a; wagon
he was driving onto a pile of rocks. It
is very dark" at the place where he. was
discovered and it is surmised from the;
wheel marks on the pile that ;the ye : '
hide was driven over the heap. The
accident must have occurred at mid *
night, at which hour Murphy finished
his work at Fifth avenue and Fulton
street, and was on his way to put his
horse up for the night.
Dr. S. deary at a late examination,
of the patient last evening expressed
the probability of his recovery, though
the case appeared critical.
Murphy has been |in the employ .ot
the Geary Street Railroad Company for
twenty-six years. He is a man of
strictly sober habits â¢ and is highly
esteemed. \u25a0 \u25a0 " â¢ .
James Murphy, an old and respected
employe \>f the Geary Street Railroad
Company/ living at 415 First avenue,
was r found" about 6 o'clock yesterday
morning lying in an unconscious state
on Fourth avenue near C street. * F. A.
Brookbank, who discovered the man,
called for assistance and he was taken
to the Park Emergency Hospital. There
it was found that Murphy was suffer
ing from a fracture of the base of the
skull. . His family had' him removed to
the French Hospital. '
In arranging to join her !n this city he
\u25a0wrote on July JT: "Can't you have Mrs.
Brown meet me at the train and I go
home with her, you know, if w. is there,
but if I don't see her I'll know he's not
up. In case he comes on the day you
set for me Just send her to the train."
The last letter is dated July 14. In it
he wrote: "Darling loved one, be sure to
get a Masonic pin and remember when
you get into California there is a law that
Till take him away from you and keep
him away at your request. All you have
to do is tell the police. He don't even
dare touch you without your consent,
and you don't have to live with 'him ct
s.U, let alor.e come back here with him.
Do try to get free after you get-well. If
you die, loved one. remember my heart
dies with you." Mrs. Stephenson was
rearing a Masonic pin when brought to
the City Prison on Saturday and it is
being held as evidence.
In the letters mention is frequently
made of Mrs. Clara Brown as a true
friend. The police say that Mrs. Brown
lives in Oakland and acted as a go-be
tween for Bowen and Mrs. Stephenson.
She will be asked to appear at the
Coroner's inquest. Among Bowen's pa
pers a card was found bearing the fol
lowing: "Prof. Chilion Bowcn, instructor
of piano, violin, mandolin, guitar, voice
end harmony."
The police claim that Stephenson was
shot before he entered the room. Their
theory is that Bowen was standing be
hind the door with one hand on the knob
and thÂ«Â» ether grasping: the revolver.
M'hen the doer burst open Stephenson's
head . appeared and Bowen aimed at his
ear. Stephenson turned his head around
tharply and the bullet struck him on the
chin. He staggered two paces toward his
rvife. clutching the revolver in his coat
pocket, and fell dead at her feet, Bowen
firing the other shot at him as he fell,
the bullet striking him on the back of
the head. Â«
"Don't go to the city, but go to Car-
Eon or .Virginia or Sparks or some place
where I can see you once In a while, as
1 may stay here for a while. How would
yeu think it would do, or would you feel
better to fly away entirely and let me
come to you?"
On May 2S he wrote her that he had
eee:i two men he had phot at, but they
did not recognize him. He told her:
Ciiilion Bowen and the -wife of the man
he murdered at 10154 Larkln street on
Saturday rooming were seen by an attor
ney at the City Prison yesterday inorn
\cs. On his advice thc-y declined to make
try further statements in regard to the
shooting-. The woman, Mrs. W. W.
Stephenson. has assumed a defiant and
iilscourieous attitude toward those who
speak to her. All her thoughts are cen
tered upon Bowen, and she seems to care
nothing about her four fatherless chil
dren in Waskoe City. Xev.
Detectives Matheson and Mulcahy
found several letters yesterday written
by Bowen to Mre. Stephenson. All
breathed the most ardent love for the
\u25a0woman, the expressions "darling heart,"
"sweetest own sweet." "your own fond,
true love." "your lover as ever, solid as
6tone," "light of my soul," and others'
equally passionate being frequent.
They show that he had been supplying
her with money at different times and
had been urging her to give up her hus
band for him. After he had been or
dered away from the Stephenson home
they selected a rock, where each left let
ters for the other.

lest 2 coda not walk straight. It would grow
jaore oscere vatil it censed waterbrash and vom-
itlar ef a slimy yellow water. A physician told
snel had a form of dyspepsia and treated me for
about six months with but little benefit. An-
ether pnysidan told me my liver was oat of or-
der and that X had indigestion. Be gave me a
treatment and X got some better but only for a
thort time. I then tried another one. who said X
had chrwdc Indigestion, ukeretion of the lining
