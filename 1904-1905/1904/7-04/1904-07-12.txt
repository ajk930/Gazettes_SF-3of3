CHEFU, July 11.â Heavy firing at
Port ArthtJTl s:aa. heard between Land
2 o'clock on Sunday afternoon ,by the
Chicago Daily News* dispatch-boat
Fawan. During the day the Japanese
picket ship stood closer to the entrance
of the harbor than usual. At '11:13
o'clock at night heavy firing was again
heard, and the activity of the search
lights indicated the approach of Japa
nese torpedo-boats. The attack lasted
fifty minutes, but it was impossible to
ascertain what was accomplished. It
is likely, however, that the boats placed
mines In the outer harbor.
Much smoke hangs over Port Arthur.
On Monday morning the dispatch-boat
Fawan ran in as far as it dared. Occa
sional firing was heard. Two heavy
explosions were noticed at about 10:30
o'clock, followed by a cloud of. black
smoke, which rose above West Basin.
Many drifting mines have been seen
on this cruise. One of these was a Rus
sian electro-contact mine. Others were
not familiar to the men on the Fawan.
All of these mines were, in neutral
waters. Apparently the Russians place
no limit on their sending out of float
ing mines. It is almost impossible to
see these mines in a heavy sea or when
sailing against the sunlight. It Is ut
terly impossible to see them at night or
in fogs. Many inoffensive junks have
been destroyed by striking them'. The
Fawan passed a fragment of a blown
up junk to-day.
At Hwangchingtao Islands it is In
sisted that a warship painted white,
with four yellow funnels, steamed out
of Port Arthur at 9 o'clock on Thurs
day morning, and keeping a south
easterly course had the Miaotao Islands
abeam when It perceived the Japa
nese ships, and turning back circled to
the north of Hwangchingtao and then
made off at full speed in the direction
of Thoki Island, pursued by eight Japa
nese torpedo-boats. One fisherman said
that his boat was almost run down by
the Russian cruiser, the decks of which
were packed with men. The JapansM
boats were seen returning at S o'clock.
While observing the firing at Port Ar
thur it was noticed that a bombard
ment was apparently being conducted
from some distance inland. The shots
, averaged sixteen a minute. It was lmÂ«
possible to distinguish between the firs
of the Japanese guns and the reply ol
the Russians. Allowing for five min
utes as the fastest economical rate o!
discharge for each gun, it was esti
mated that the Japanese have no*
eighty siege guns in position.
CIIEFU. July 11. â There was heavy

Zeller is a market gardener, who had
always borne a good reputation until
Saturday morning, when he stabbed his
v ife to death and then killed his father
in-law, J. R. Burkamp, â¬9 years of age,
who had run to his daughter's assist
ance. Both of his victims died in a few
minutes, and Zeller then entered his
dwelling, wiped the blood off the knife
and struck out across a cornfield. That
was the last seen of him until his dra
matic reappearance this afternoon.
He afterward explained that it was
because he was desperate to get a
drink of water and something to eat
that he came out of his hiding place.
"My sons abused me and my wife
took thfcir part." he said. "It had been
Eoing on for years. It hurts me to
talk."
To the ogicers Zeller was able to say
a few -words before he sank into an un
conscious condition. It was gathered
I:om his fragmentary sentences that
he had lain out in the high brush be
tween his house and the cemetery dur
ing the entire time the "posse was
Bearchlng for him, and he said that
several officers passed within six feet
of him.
"What was the cause of the trag
edy?" Zeller was asked. . /â¢ , l
ZelJer was carried into his own home,
only a stone's throw from the scene,
I.!aced in a comfortable position and
left In charge of a police officer.
Suddenly during the services Zeller
â¢ merged from a thicket on the ceme
tery grounds and attracted the atten
tion of the mourners. He was still
armed with the knife with which he
had committed the murders. Those at
the grave were dazed at sight of the
man. Before they had time to cry out
or run he drew the knife twice across
his abdomen and fell to the ground.
City Physician Ralph, who happened
to be near by, snatched the knife from
his hands and prevented him harming
himself further. But the wounds were
serious enough. Dr. Ralrh siid.^to cause
the man's death.

The seven then stole quietly , to the
home of Miss Pratt and found McKean
sitting on the porch. One -of the girls
asked him to come out, as they wanted
to speak to him. McKean refused.-
At once the seven girls rushed upon
the porch, dragged McKean from his
chair and threw him to the- floor. He
fought oesperately, but was overpow

girls took turns in lashing him, un
ceremoniously brushing aside Miss
Pratt and her mother and giving no
heed to the screams of the two.

The fire started by a spark from an
engine in Madary s mill. It lit in a bed
of shavings and in a second's time from
the time the rirst flame was discovered
the whole building was aflame. Men
had not time to take their tools from
the Denchee with them. An alarm was
turned in ar.d the whole lire depart
ment was on the spot in four minutes'
time, but like wild fire the flames had
spread and enveloped buildings ad
joining. Great credit is given the fire
department for the work it did. Three
of the mcu were overcome by the heat
and had tc be dragged from the smoke.-
The block destroyed is bounded by
Kern, Inyo, H and I streets and is sur
rounded by buildings of light material.
Repeatedly those buildings were
aflame. One brick building, occupied
by McKay's livery stable, was the only
structure in the block not destroyed.
The lositig tfrms were as follows:
Madary Planing Mill Company, $150.

$35,000 Hollenbeck-Bush Planing Mill,
$10,0i)0; German Savings and Loan As

Alexander has been operating "Argo"
at the Chutes and, according to the
story, told by Nicholson to the police,
is a man of strong 1 blows as well as
strong lungs. t Nicholson says he has
worked for Alexander for some time,
but was. told yesterday that his wages
were to be reduced. Last night he
asked Alexander for the money then
due him, Intending to quit. Alexander
asked him to agree to remain until
after the crowd had left the grounds
and Nicholson consented. He was to-ld
to go into the room of mystery where
the body of a young woman Is lifted
from a coffin in such a realistic man
ner that chills of terror creep up and
down the spines of timid spectators.
In that uncanny department Alexander
assaulted him, having first locked the
door to prevent any escape. Nicholson
says Alexander repeatedly knocked
him down and kicked him until uncon
sciousness took all the pain from his
senses. Alexander became frightened
at tho continued stupor of his victim
and dashed water in his face to revive
him. As soon as Nicholson could get
out he proceeded' to the Park Emer
gency Hospital, | where he had his
wounds dressed and notified the police.
Alexander does not deny that he as
saulted Nicholson, but gives as a rea
son that the young man had been ex
posing the mystery of the illusion and
spoiling the attraction. Alexander had
the exclusive concession for the de
ceptive freak and had made It one of
the attractions at the Chutes.
The management of the Chutes an
nounced last night that even if Alex
ander was not'eonvicted for his as
sault on Nicholson, , he could not con
tinue his show within the grounds.
"Professor" Claude Alexander, the
man with "the greatest illusion on
earth," is confined at the Park police
station on a charge of assault to do
great bodily harm on the person of
William Nicholson. Alexander's vic
tim had his wounds dressed at the
Park Emergency Hospital and was
latÂ».- taken to his home at 706 Sixth
avenue.

ST. LOUIS, July 11.â After three con
ferences held on Saturday night by
members of the executive committee of
the Populist party with prominent
Bryan Democrats who are dissatisfied,
not so much with the platform as with
the Presidential nomination by the
Democratic National Convention, a line
of action for the coming campaign has
been agreed upon.
This statement is given upon the au
thority of George Washburn of Bos
ton, now treasurer of the Populist Â«par
ty. who, \yith several members of the
national executive com'mittee of that
party, has been In St. Louis attending
the Democratic National Convention.
Washburn. when asked to divulge the
names of some of His associates in the
conference, refused to make them
known. The extent of the movement
and the names of those engaged in It,
he said, would be made public when
the call for the national conference
was issued and their prominence,' he
said, would be a surprise. ' A number
of those present 1n the conference,
Washburn said, were Missourians,
while others were from Parker's own
State.
Commenting on Judge Parker's nom
ination. Washburn said:
"Next to Cleveland, the Populists
most desired the nomination of Parker.
His nomination emphasizes the part
ing of the ways of the allied forces and
will help immensely to restore (he Pop
ulist party to its former strength and
effectiveness."
NEW YORK, July 11.â General Man
ager Brooks of the Western Union Tel
egraph â¢. Company- said- to-day thnt the
message sent by Judge Parker to
Sheehan at St. Louis relative to tho
platform adopted by the Democratic
National Convention was not delayed
in delivery. by the Western Union Com
pany. The message, Brooks says, was
transmitted, from Esopus immediately
and delivered promptly to the address
giVen.and a copy handed to Sheehan
personally as soon as ; he could" be
found. However, the story of a verifi
cation of /the dispatch is correct and
the request for it came from St. Louis,
but from whom is not known.
Verification WÂ«s Asked For.

Harrity, former chairman of the Demo

"Judge Parker's timely telegram to
the convention has strengthened his
candidacy Immensely. His action with
reference to the absence from the plat
form of a gold standard declaration
f ho wed great courage and decision of
character. I predict that his strength
v.ill increase as the campaign pro
gresses."
When my train arrived at 4 o'clock in the

have made a single suggestion which would
hi.ve been an Improvement on Its course. In

KANSAS CITY, July 1Lâ William A.
â¢Clark. United States Senator from
Montana, who -was in Kansas City to
day on his way home from the East,
SOU, regarding the ticket named by
the Democratic National Convention:
"It Is a good ticket and the platform
is all right. The silver -question as a
political Issue is dead. I am Just as
much a blrrretallist as ever, but the
unusual increase in the production of
gold has temporarily shelved the free
silver issue. The platfcrm Is not one
that particularly appeals to the West,
but we will not fight it. As far as the
monetary question is concerned it is
a standoff between the platforms of the
Republican and the Democratic con
ventions. But Parker is a. safe, con
servative man and - the . nominee for
Vice President is entirely satisfactory.
They will be elected. We will carry
New Yc-rk by 100,000 and West Vir
ginia v.ill go from the Republican to
the Democratic column."
Under these circumstances the nomination
of JudÂ£e Harker. who was without any record
us the coinage question, except Â«that he had
voted twice lor 3J.r. Uryan, seemed to preclude
th t tiightttt hor* that he would receive even
f- :,-.u:.;. electoral Vutee as Mr. Bryan polled
la l'JOO. But this very pusillanimity of his
inanasert which led them to surrender their
own convictions and to stifle every attempt of
th- New York City delegates even to voice

an. oinioriunity which he has Improved de

through exiÂ«?rience or reading; a courageous
niiui â of such incomparable courage that he
we* willing to throw away not merely the
hope of a nomination, but an actual nomina

NEW YORK, July 11.â Bourke Cock
ran to-day gave to the press the fol
lowing cc-mrr.unicatiun, explaining his
â¢iecliaatkm to address the Democratic
National Convention at St. Louis:
CHICAGO. July 1Lâ According to a
report that reached this city to-day
William J. Bryan is awaiting word
from Judge Parker before replying to
the invitation of the Chicago Democ
racy to appear at a demonstration be
ing arranged for the first week in Aug
ust. If he accepts it will be understood
that the Democratic nominee for Pres
ident has held out the olive branch to
the Nebraska orator and that Bryan
will bo the first to .take the stump in
the West for the ticket nominated in
i*t. Louis.
"It is for this purpose that Chair
man Jones will first consult with Judge
Parker in order to make the dates of
the notification and the national com
mittee meeting coincide and thus af
ford the candidate an opportunity to
meet the men who will lead his cam
paign in the various States.
â¢'At this meeting the national com
mittee will select a chairman, secre
tary, treasurer and sergeant at arms.
The committee will then take up such
other matters as may properly come
before it at that time. The national
committee will, of . course, consult
Judge Parker and his friends before
organizing."
organization of the new committee:
'"Senator James K. Jones will, under
the instructions given him by the reso
lution passed by the convention on
Saturday, call a meeting of the na
tional committee as soon as he confers
with Judge Alton B. Parker, the nomi
nee of the party for President, and his
friends and learns from them the date
fixed for notifying the nominees of
their selection by the convention.
"He will then call a meeting of the
national committee, to be held In New
York City, it being Judge Parker's
wish to meet as many as possible of
the national committeemen in attend
ance upon the meeting.
..-.â¢â¢ This afternoon,; in reply to his tele
gram of .congratulation to former Sen
ator Henry Davis, the nominee for Vice
President, Judge Parker received the
following: , ; ... .-..;. .:-..-. }Â¦
"ELKINS, W. Var^-Delayed in reach

. William P. Sheehan arrived at Eso
pus from St. Louis this afternoon. He
â¢was met at the station by Mrs. Sheehan
and was driven . to his summer .., home
near Rosemont. On ( the way Sheehan
met Judge, and Mrs. Parker, who were
driving. The^ two gentlemen alighted
and greeted each other. .Mrs. Parker
and Mrs. Sheehan then drove to the
Sheehan house in one carriage and
Judge Parker and Sheehan in the other.
Later Sheehan made this statement: /
"I am authorized to say that no' tele
gram was sent by Judge Parker to Sen
ator Hill on any subject while the lat
ter.^was in St;< Louis."
.Judge ; Parker returned, from Shee
han's house'at .7 o'clock.
PARKER VISITS SHEEHAX.
Judge Parker had voted for Bryan in
lrV$ and 1900, and he had done so not
because of but in spite of the silver
clank. He did not think that any one
had any doubt as to where he stood,
and had hoped to. maintain his silence
throughout the campaign preliminary
to the convention.
Surveyors to-day began laying ,the
lines for the new West Shore station
at Esopus, which will be completed in
about two weeks. A long siding will be
put in for special trains.
As far as his plans have as yet been
made Judge Parker will not tour the
country making speeches. His personal
campaign will be 'conducted in' a Avay
similar to that of President McKlnley â
to a large degree from the porch at
Rosemont. He probably\will make only
one* or two pilgrimages to the larger
cities.
An explanatory statement of the long
silence of Judge Parker was given by
a close friend of the Judge this after
noon. As a Judge, said the authority,
Parker his kept silent on, political ques
tions. He believed that it was not com
patible with the dignity of a Judge on
the bench to discuss such questions.
When he was prominently mentioned
as a candidate . for the Presidency
Judge Parker thought that the people
of the country knew his full views. He
realized that the Democratic party
would be composed of two elements
when the national convention assem
bled â radicals and conservatives. He
knew that he was regarded as the can
didate of the conservatives and became
convinced that it was not necessary to
make any statement. of his views.
PARKERS CAMPAIGN PLAN.
: "You must permit me to expres my
gratitude and admiration for the splen
did manifestation of honor and courage
ypu, have given to your countrymen
and to the Democracy' in your St. Louis
dispatch." , ..
The telegram from William R.
Hearst, sent on Saturday, went astray,
but a duplicate was received to-day,
as follows, dated Chicago, July 10: â¢)
"I congratulate, you on your nomina
tion and on the* expression of Demo
cratic principles in the platform on
which vou stand. I hope and beliÂ»ve
that, battling for the people and for
such principles, you will lead the Lv
mocracy. to victory."
Judge Parker immediately wrote to
Hearst the following letter:
"Hon. William Randolph Hearst-
Dear Sir:. Just a word to thank you
for your very kind message of congrat
ulation and to assure you of my great
grateful appreciation. Very truly,
"ALTON B. PARKER."'
Judge Parker received to-day the fol
lowing message from former President
Cleveland: .
"That night while the convention
tossed and billowed with the sensation
he. had produced : he did not go early to
bed, as he had done the night before,
although the : local celebration in his
honor ceased and the people dispersed
as early as 10:15 o'clock. He sat up
until after 3 o'clock, closely watching
the bulletins, and made no move
toward retiring until after the action
of the convention on his telegram was
made plain to him.
"It is not true that Judge Parker sent
a message to Senator Hill demanding
the insertion of a gold plank. His tele
gram to William F. Sheehan was his
first communication, directly or Indi
rectly, with the' convention."
PRAISE FROM CLEVELAND.
"About 11:30 - ; o'clock he rode up to
the railroad station,' asked for tele
grams and /received; quite a bunch of
them. I happen tq know that none of
them gave him Â¦ the information he
wanted. He chatted with the reporters
for awhile 'and it was afterward re
called that some, of his questions to
them betrayed the fact of his 'lack, of
first-hand knowledge of the" conven
tion's action. He waited about the sta
tion, almost irresolute" in bearing; for
fully ten minutes- and then' suddenly
galloped back toward Rosemont. . An
hour afterward: the famous telegram
was filed with the' operator and the
remarkable' series of events was under
way. " " ' â¢ . . .
"When Judge Parker retired at 9:45
o'clock on ; Friday night," said this
man, "he did not know anything- at
all about the financial side of the plat;
form, which had been agreed upon,
more than " was" outlined \ in the â¢ very
brief bulletins telephoned' from
Kingston. When informed by_ a press
correspondent at 6:15 a. ml" of the bare
fact of his nomination, he knew no
more, arid th<>_ first real knowledge he
had of the action of the convention on
the financial plank in the platform was
when he read' the! New York morning
papers. Immediately after breakfast
that is to say; a little after 9 o'clock
he started for. a horseback ride. Just
before mounting his horse a telegram
was handed: to him, giving 1 a concise
outline of the platform. From the mo
ment of his reading of that telegram
it was noticed that- he was very much
preoccupied and as he rode off his head
was bowed as if in deep thought.'

LONDON. July 11.â The attempt of
the London Daily Express to revive the
bogey of a possible Russian invasion
of India by the publication *of an al
leged secret plan of campaign prepared
by General Kuropatkin has not created
a ripple of excitement. Even if the
document is authentic, it is recognized
that it will not give the slightest cause
for alarm. It is pointed out that the
whole scheme as published is of so
academic a character that there is
nothing in the nature of a direct men
ace therein. Probably the pigeon-holes
of all the War in Europe are
filled with similar plans providing for
theoretic invasions of their next sdoor
neighbor's territory.

"At noon the Japanese artillery ar
rived and engaged the Cossack horse
battery. The Russians made no at
tempt seriously to contest the ground,
but retired to a fresh positiondat the
same time worrying the enemy.
"The whole of our artillery, remain
ing in the rear and covering the in
fantry retreat at Pintzan, allowed the
Japanese to come up and then shelled
them. Again the fight developed with
some warmth, while the Japanese
brought up fresh batteries, with which
they pounded the village.
"General Stakelberg hung on until
late in the afternoon. We could hear
his guns growling behind us as the
column moved northward. Quiet then
ensued and the march was continued
uninterruptedly to Tatchekiao.
"There has just been captured here
a Japanese, who, from his attire, seem
ed to be a bank clerk. He speaks Rus
sian fluently." ,
"There was little rifle fire. The Rus
sian main column was already pro
ceeding north, a few Cossacks, hover
ing in the rear, supporting the batte
ries.
ARTILLERY COVERS RETREAT
"The entire day was marked by a
Ions series of artillery duels. The
enemy in front covered the plain on
both sidf-s of the road and the defiles
in the eastern hills. Wherever an ad
vance movement appeared it was
greeted by the bark of the quick-firers
and the drumming of the machine
guns.
"The Japanese advance commenced
at dawn, at first quietly and cautiously
and then with a rush thirty-five in
fantry companies hurled themselves
across the river. They must have been
surprised to find themselves unopposed
and greeted only by the smoke of the
warehouse, which we had set on fire
before retiring.
"Our batteries had got away Ions
before the arrival of the Japanese and'
were in a position north of the town,
from which they greeted the Japanese
with a hail of shrapnel as they started
to foliow our retreat.

bless its standards.
The papers lecall a similar message
sent by the Emperor to a regiment of
British dragoons, of which he was hon
orary colonel, before its departure for
South Africa during the Boer war, and
point to the fact that his Majesty at
the spring parade at Potsdam ex
pressed to the Japanese military at
tache his admiration for the bravery of
the Japanese troops. They say that the
message was purely a courtly and mili
tary one from a soldier's point of view,
with greatest honor to the regiment to
be sent to the front. The concluding
prayer was merely for the welfare of
the soldiers, and the expression of sin
cere wishes was only a desire that they
should add to their laurels as a regi
ment. >Â»
The opposition papers content them
selves by saying that the zeal of the
semi-official press doubtless is due to
the impression created by the Em
peror's telegram declaring that Rus

mourning.

"Both sides held their respective po

night. Japanese reserves were hurry
ing up and concentrating f ot a morn
ing attack, but we had held out as
long as advisable in the face of the
growing number of the . enemy and
quietly prepared to evacuata
"In the meantime the Japanese cav
alry on the extreme west tried to creep
around the shore of the Gulf of Liao
tung but our batteries headed off the
cavalrymen and drove them in con
fusion. By noon the advance was
checked at all points, though increas
ing numbers of Japanese were seen
gathering in the hills and their batte
ries threw an occasional shot.
RETIRE AT NIGHT.
"We had a squadron of cavalry and
a battalion of infantry across the river,
and through the golden haze we could
Just see them maneuvering to meet
the Japanese column, which they en
gaged fiercely. The Japanese finally
rolled back.
â¢'Early in the morning of July 8 the
hills to the southward and eastward of
Kaichou were apparently deserted, but
we were aware that the Japanese were
ready to spring. had destroyed the
railroad bridge south of the town and
had a strong line of rifle pits .along
the bank of the river,
"It was a brilliant maneuver. The
Japanese began to advance from the
defiles where they were concealed and,
taking cover behind the thick trees
and in the gardens south of the river,
kept their batteries ' on the hill tops
carefully masked.
"While the Japanese crept forward
100 yards, keeping up a fierce exchange
with our riflemen, another column
started to work around pur left,
through a deep valley. The sound of a
heavy rifle fire at the railway station
told us that the column had struck our
outposts. Then our battery behind the
station opened fire and the advance in
that direction, was checked.
"On July 7, Eekhardt, with a small
detachment of mounted volunteers,
made a bold and rapid sweep through
and around the Japanese lines and re
turned, with exact information as to
the disposition of the enemy. Eekhardt
penetrated clear to Senuchen and found
fvo divisions moving in three columns
in three parallel valleys toward our
flank. The main Japanese force bi
vouacked at Vafangow.

the road was lively, but our losses were

"There had been preliminary skir

around Kaichou since July 5. On the
following: day two companies were
caught in the hills to the eastward and
surrounded by six Japanese battalions.
They cut their way out and return*^
to Kaichou, bringing many wounded.

Japanese scouts are close to Yinkow.
They can be seen on the neighboring
hilltops, from which they occasionally
tire on the Russian outposts.
The Japanese began to push their ad
vance north at dawn on July 9 after
taking Kaichou, and since then they
have proceeded steadily. They kept
th*ir artillery well to the front and
ehelled and occupied Pintzan, seven
rr.iles north of Kaichou, at noon on
July S. It is now reported that they are
in close touch with Tatchekiao.
General Oku is said to be wearing a
Chinese costume.
YI.VKOW, July 11.â Japanese vessels
have been seen off Kaichou. It is be
lieved that they are keeping in touch
with the advance of the land forces,
and that if the Japanese take Tatche
kiao, which is thought to be their ob
jective, a landing will be made simul
taneously at Tinkow.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 11.âGen
eral Kuropatkin. according to private
edvices from the front, will not make
a serious attempt to hold Tatchekiao,
above Kiachou, midway between that
place and Halcheng and where the
railroad connects with the branch from
Newchwang. Developments of the Jap
anese strength on the Siuyen road
peem to be forcing a Russian concen
tration between Haicheng and Liao
yeng, but preparations are making to
defend the former as long as possible.
General Count Keller's force, which
was a little south of Liaoyang, has
apparently moved farther southward,
to stay the advance of the Japanese
direct on the Fengwangcheng-Hal
cheng road.
The pressure on the Russian left rear
as it withdraws continues. There is
row seemingly practically nothing in
the way of a Japanese occupation of
rcewchwang and the completion of the
Japanese line across the head of the
Liaotung peninsula. The fortification
of the passes of Fenshui range and the
Fcmi-circle eastward of Liaoyang is
reported. ,

"Of course, all this was not won
without losses, some of which/ will
strike the hearts of our countrymen.
"We started to take the offensive on
the night of July 1, when we began a
strong attack. Our soldiers, who had
been forced back at Kinchou, were
waiting for an opportunity to get at the
Japanese. The result was most satis
factory. The Infantry marched out as
if engaged in maneuvers, while the ar
tillery, taking up a position, opened a
fierce flre with shrapnel on the enemy'3
line, resulting in their retirement.
"During" the three days' battle the
Novik and a fleet of gunboats left the
harbor daily, covering the right flank
of the army and stopping the fire of
the enemy's artillery. On July 4 the
Novik finally obtained the range of the
enemy's batteries and did frightful
damage to them. All the morning the
gjunboats, without receiving any return
fire, shelled the enemy's troops march-
Ing toward our defenses. The Japanese
fleet appeared in the afternoon and our
gunboats returned to the inner harbor
without sustaining any damage."
"After three days' fighting the posi
tions of the two armies are as follows:
On the left flank we retained the posi
tion we originally^ occupied. The forc
ing of our right flank back previous to
this was rectified, and we have both
Green and Semaphore hills in our
hands. In front of these hills we are
not opposed, but we are being heavily
shelled from both sides. The enemy re
tired a considerable distance.
CHEFU, July 11.â The Port Arthur

"Heayy fighting has occurred between
the first line of defenses and the Japa
nese. The results are not announced.
Nevertheless, little at a time, the facts
are becoming known. Our side sent
scouts to ascertain the position and
strength of the enemy and whether
they were protected by trenches. It was
Impossible to find out the exact
strength of the Japanese, but they do
not number less than 30,000. The Chi

OF LVTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Everything but the relief map of the
University of California display is in
place and- visitors are already wander
ing through the vestibule of the Palace
of Education; where it is located. The
Lick Observatory negatives show in a
thoroughly successful manner, forming
a side wall of illuminated pictures.
Astronomical s&vants are already mak
ing this display a center and are dis
cussing the views shown. . These will
become one of the famous educational
exhibits of the fair, and by being in
direct connection with ' the university
will bring that Institution added glory.
The Lick Observatory is one of the
best known institutions of the world.
Fresh fruits, coming in now in quan-*
titles, are adding to the beauty of the
California display in the Horticultural
building. These fruits are better than
those shown by any other State. As
a matter cf fact, few other States at
tempt any important display of fresh
fruits. The good condition in which
the California product usually arrives
is also an advertisement of benefit to
the State. It loses none of its excel
lence in its lone trip across the pon
tinent.
San Franciscans are finding that
city's building in the model street. The
register shows a great crowd of vis
itors oach day, many of whom are from
the Pacific Coast metropolis. San
Franciscans are beginning to make this
building their first stopping place when
they reach the fair. It is within si
few hundred feet of what has become
the main entrance to the fair, and the
San Franciscans catch their breath
there, get their bearings and map out
their plan of campaign before getting
to work sightseeing. Californians in
general arc finding the, building a pop
ular headquarters and deem them
selves fortunate in having a. resting
place at each side of the principal ex
hibit section of the fair where they can
feel at home, the State building being
the other. Visitors are given pleasant
receptions at both these structures an:l
both the buildings will be popular cen
ters during the life of the fair.
He decorated the back wall of the
California political headquarters at
the Jefferson Hotel with raisins in at
tractive boxes and thousands of peo
ple saw tlve display there, â¢ Fresno
raising have fought their way success
fully against the foreign article until
now a few from Spain are about till
that find their way across the Atlantic.
Fresno's only concern now is to teach
the people to eat raisins. She'll do her
part and raise them if the consumers
will only do their duty. In England
and other foreign countries the
amount of raisins consumed per capita
is much greater than it is here. The
use of that fruit in America is grow
ing, but not fast enough to keep the
prices of Fresno raisins where they
should be. Other counties make raisin
displays here and show some* fine ones,
but none can vie with the original
home of that product in California.
Soil and climate give Fresno the lead
in that particular product and she will
always be the raisin center.
PALACE OF EDUCATION*.
ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA DIS
PLAYS THAT ATTRACTS MANY
VISITORS.
The raisins of Fresno County, are
a telling exhibit of the resources of a
State. Â£ Put. up in fancy boxes, the
raisin | arrests the attention as . does
a pretty show â¢. of candy. . Commis
sioner Wyer . never Idses an opport
unity to put hiSv^guuty to the front
The California wine display is pro
ducing even better results than hoped
for. Commissienor \ Haber has sent
out thousands of cards inviting 1 Vdeal
ers and men who would possibly be
come purchasers of wine for their
tables to visit the wine temple and
sample the vintages there. The wine
exhibit Is drawing as many visitors as
any other- exhibit in the Agricultural
building and there is no doubt that
great benefit will accrue to the in
dustry from it. Notes and addresses
of firms selling certain of the wines
shown are jotted down by visitors.
The labeling of the bottles has been
well done and they appear to good
advantage. A French artist who called
at the exhibit was so pleased with It
that he wrote a letter to Mr., Haber
in which he said the display was one
of the most artistic he had ever seen
at a fair. .-
To create a market for olive oil is
the great task before the growers of
that commodity In California. Those
exhibiting oil here find the Eastern
public must be educated as to the dif
ference between the pure article and
the cottonseed mixtures sold generally
as olive. The main obstacle in the
way of weaning the public from the
adulterated oil is the much higher
price that must be charged for the
pure California product. Having been
used to procuring what they thought
was olive oil for very little money,
many people cannot easily bring them
selves to pay the higher prices for
the superior California product, gen
erally pronounced superior to the im
ported.
MUST EDUCATE PUBLIC.
CALL BUREAU. PRESS BUILD
ING, WORLDS FAIR, ST. LOUIS,
July 11.â There are many visitors to
this exposition who will learn for the
first time that often when they buy
supposed foreign articles of a sort pro
duced in California, they are simply
buying California goods, sometimes of
an inferior quality and usually at a
greater price, with a foreign label.
That California wines and prunes are
reshipped from the old world to Am
erica under foreign labels and that
vast quantities of Southern cotton seed
oil come back here as "pure imported
olive oil" to compete with the Cali
fornia oil are facts unknown to the
great majority of Easterners, notwith
standing the constant publicity given J
them. The men in charge of the Call- j
fornia exhibit here have noted the im
portance of disseminating this sort of
information and visitors to the booths
in the agricultural building are in
formed that if they want a genuine
article they would best buy California
products and not worship before the
foreign label. Labels can be bought
more cheaply 'directly from the factory
than they can on the bottles and pack
ages prepared by the cunning foreign
er who has learned that only his labels
are superior in contest with California
goods.
Some of the County Commissioners
in charge of exhibits at the Agricult
ural building are of th; opinion that
money spent in a direct campaign
throughout the East against the wor
ship of the foreign label and in edu
cating the people to the fact that they
are being imposed upon would be of
great benefit to the State. There is no
reason why any appreciable quantities
of certai - products grown in Califor
nia, such as wine, olive oil, prunes,
raisins and, after a while, Smyrna
figs, should be brought from the old
world for consumption in America,
California can always supply this coun
try with these goods, j Of course there
; are a few brands of wines, champagnes
I especially, and oils produced in foreign
countries that will always be sought*
, but the use 'of these will not material
j ly injure California, It Is the use of
j articles inferior to or no better than
i her own, simply because they bear
; that strange virtue of having, in some
j cases osteneibly only, come from a
Â¦ country other than America, that she
need fear.

the acreage of corn planted to be about
91,930,000 acres'^ an increase of about
2,130,000 acres, or 2.4 per cent on the

Going deeper into the proposition of
rights. Van Ness asked if Monroe un
deretor-d it to be the right of unions
by pickets and boycotts to interfere
with a man's business because he did
not do as the unions wanted. Maguire,
the attorney for the union, objected to
the question a? requiring an expres
sion of the witness's opinion and an
interpretatiem of union rules which
had not been mentioned in the plead
ings. Monroe was of the opinion that
a union had a richt to dictate to an
employer as to what kind of work an
employe should do and cited that a
hostler under unicn rules would not
be permitted to clean harness in the
stable nor would a harness .man be
permitted to clean horses â it would be
one man doing two men's work, he
paid.
The trial of the case will be resumed
th!s morning:.
In respens*? to further questions Mon
roe argued that an employer had no
legal right To agree with his employes
as to the hours of work or amount of
ray they should get and in explanation
of his belief that a laborer had a right
to demand certain hours and certain
pay the witness said that he had work
ed in a stable here before the time of
unions and that he received $30 a
month for working from 3 o'clock in
the morning to 9 at night. He asked
if the attorney thought that was legal,
whereupon Judge Hunt Interrupted
him and told him that he need not ar
gue the case.
Monroe responded in the negative
and said: "We don't object to how h*i
runs his stable, but we do object to
his trying to run our business, and I
guess we have as much interest in la
bor as he has in his own business."
Van 6s asked it Monroe, as a
union man, recognized the right of
Pierce and other stable owners to run
their business in their own way so
long as they did not interfere with the
union or the union's business. The
witness proceeded to explain that
Pierce had called his unioi. men down
from their work one day in April and
showed them an "open shop" card,
tolling them if they did not want to
work under those signs they could take
thf-ir hats and go. Monroe said that in
this action Pierce was dictating to the
union men as to how they should work.
Thereupon Van Ness asked if there
was any law against posting such
cards, or if Monroe knew of any legal
right of a union to dictate to an em
ployer who put up open-shop cards.
The witness declared that as long as
an employer had up" an open shop card
and had no union men working for
him, the union not care how many
cards he posted, but it objected to- em
ployers hiring non-union men and put
tins them in with union men.
ARGUMENT FOB LAWYERS.
When asked by Van Ness what he
expected to accomplish by having thir
ty-five men parade in a circle, Mon
roe replied that he . intended to notify j
the union and laboring people not to
patronize an unfair stable. Van N ss j
risked if this could not have I en done !
with a single-banner man and Monroe j
said he thought the more pressure |
brought to b?ar the quicker the thin? |
would be ended. Questioned further j
Monroe declared that while one or two
men would not b^ seen, thirty-five or
fifty would attract the attention of "a. i
lot of the public who cannot read."
"Tour idea," said Van Ness, "was
to show Pierce that he could not run
his business the way he was running i
it but as the union wanted it run?"
MONROE'S MOTIVE.
?v!<i;:roe testified that ht took charge i
<jf the pickets about April 2SÂ», a week !
after the strike at the Nevada Stables !
v.as begun. At first only two men j
v.ere eniragred in carrying banners in ;
front of the place, but on the ninth or j
tenth of May he put on thirty-five men, j
jroing around with a horse and buggy |
to gather that number from the other j
>tab!es. He appointed captains for the i
pickets v.t the various stables. He )
hirr.-pelf remained at headquarters, but
when he heard *of a disturbance among
the rackets at the Nevada Stables he Â¦
would go down and take the disturbers j
cut of the liae aui send them to the ;
ofitoe. The disturbance, he said, con- j
s-isied in their "hollering things I told |
them rot to holler,'" being drunk or
tJsorderly and talking in loud tones.
Answering: questions asked by T. C.
Van Ness, attorney for Pierce, Monroe ;
said thr t in a union meeting, upon !
inotiun of some one whom he did not j
it- member, he was appointed captain |
of the pickets and given full power j
U> iutt i- his distribution and direction
of them, keeping within the bounds of J
law. Nobody had denned to him what j
xvas within the law nor did he receive ;
any other instructions. Mr. Van Ness
later questioned him in detail upon his ;
understanding of the legal rights of |
'.be Stablemen's Union and stable pro- ]
prietors. Monroe answered the queries j
with directness, but ofttimes insisted j
upon making explanations which once j
vr twice took an argumentative form.
On one of these occasions Judge Hunt
rdmorished the witness not to argue i
Lbe case, but to leave that for the at- j
tot-reve. Â¦
r C. P. Monrwe. captain of the Stable- j
Union pickets, was on the stand Â¦
LU morning in Judge Hunt's court yes- j
lerday in the trial of the suit brought j
by E. G. Pierce, proprietor of the Ne- j
k-ada Stab'.es. fur an injunction against |
ihe union. Upon the result of this ;
Ji-jarmp. as far as the lower court can j
determine, will depend the right of j
iabur organizations to use boycotts i
;.nd pickets against employers said to j
lÂ»e '"unfair."
An interesting fact in connection
I with the suit developed yesterday, when
â¢ it was learned that one of the auditors
; of the Southern Pacific Company, act-
I ing in a similar capacity for the Salt
I Lake road, had been conferring lately
! with Bender Bros, with regard to an
1 amicable settlement of the existing dif
\ faculties between them and the con-
I struction company, which would sug
\ Best that Harriman is* taking a more
| active interest in the affairs of the Salt
j Lake road than he has been willing to
! admit. Bender Bros, are inclined to
: view the suit somewhat in the light of
â¢ a move of Harriman for revenge.
According to their side of the case,
Â¦ w hen the Clark people first attempted
! to get their rights of way for their
road they were confronted on all sides
: by opposition from the Harriman inter
{ ests. and later when Senator 'Clark
â¢ and his brother went into the market
j in search of tics they were again made
j to ftel the Harrima'n influence. The
only firm that would consent to sell
; them ties was that of Bender Bros.
j Some time ago it developed that Har
riman had sained control of the Salt
Lake road, and from that time on, it is
j claimed, the lumbermen began to meet
. opposition from Harriman.
â¢It was learned yesterday that the
j dissolution of the Empire Construction
i Company has been planned for some
time, and that hereafter the San Pedro,
Loa Angeles and Salt Lake road will
j do its own building and contracting for
Â¦ material.
Attorney Hu Jones, representing
Bender Bros., stated yesterday after
noon that the suit would be bitterly
fought by his clients, who he claims
are prepared to prove that they have
not violated any of their contracts and
that the suit was actually brought to
abrogate certain contracts between the
company and the lumbermen in order
to get out of paying the price of ties
agreed on In the contracts. The mate
rial was contracted for at a time when
ties were very high, a fact over which
the defendants had no control, and
could now be bought in the market at a
very much lower rate. As to the money
advanced by the construction company,
it is claimed by Attorney Jones that
his clients would have long ago wiped
out the indebtedness had the Clark
concern kept its part of the agreement.
It is claimed that the storms along the
coast for a time prevented the loading
of schooners with the ties, and the re
cent engineers' strike also materially
decayed the deliverance of the ties, but
these obstacles were amply provided
for in the contracts between the two
parties.
HARRIMAN TAKES A HAND.
The injunction is designed to prevent
the Benders from disposing of any of
the real and personal property.
BENDERS WILL FIGHT.
It is alleged that the Benders have
delivered only 368,751 ties and have re
fused to deliver the balance of 133,249.
It is further averred that the Benders
are in possession of the land and have
greatiy lessened its value by cutting
tan bark and redwood timber thereon
and that if they are permitted to con
tinue the complainant's security will
be still further impaired. It is further
charged that the Benders, in viola
tion of their contract, have sold large
numbers of redwood ties to other par
ties and that there are a large num
ber of ties on the ground.
The complaint filed yesterday al
leges that on December 1, 1902, the
complainant advanced $38,400 for th?
purchase of lands on which to cut
railroad ties and agreed to advance
$5000 per month for six months for the
labor of making the ties. The title
was put in the name of the com
plainant and the latter gave a deed to
Bender Brothers and placed it in es
crow in the First National Bank to
secure complainant for the money ad
vanced to be paid for in railroad ties.
It was agreed further that out of the
price of every cargo of ties delivered
the complainant should have the right
to retain 25 per cent for the purpose
of repaying the amount advanced for
the purchase of the lands and 75 per
cent for the purpose of repaying the
amounts advanced for supplies and la
bor.
The Empire Construction Company
of Utah filed a complaint in the United
States Circuit Court yesterday against
William A. Bender, George L. Bender,
First National Bank of San Francisco
and others to recover $37,571 50 and the
deeds to certain lands in Mendocinj
and Sonoma counties. Judge Erskint
M. Ross granted a temporary restrain,
ing order and appointed Charles Wier
as receiver with bands at JSO,OOO.
The action will be watched with con
siderable interest by local railroad
men, for it has been hinted that an
effort will be made by the defense to
show, during the progress of the trial,
that E. H. Harriman, head of the big
Southern Pacific system and is sup
posed to have a large interest in the
San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake
road, is behind the suit. The Empire
Construction Company has as its presi
dent J- Ross Clark, a brother of Sena
tor W. A, Clark, president of the Salt
Lake road, and was organized by the
Clarks for the purpose of constructing
the road between Salt Lake and Los
Angeles. *

which he rolled when the barley was

he harvested 1000 sacks. The grain is
plump and sound and will go from 107
to 109 pounds per sack, where barley
ordinarily runs under 100 pounds to the
sack. Many of Mohr's neighbors shook
their heads when they observed him
mashing down his field of barley,
standing four feet high, with a big
wooden roller four feet in diameter. In
the corners of the field that he could
not reach with the roller the barley
was nearly all shelled out, whereas of
the rolled grain he saved it all.

Th?y thought themselves safe, but, un

the greater part of their conversation.
He immediately told his story to Offi

tified the Northern Pacific officials. The
matter has been kept very quiet by the
railway people and police, but has at
last b<*en confirmed. The saloon man,

knew for a moment that their words
had been overheard.

Some years back the Ministry real

and they started to make the most of
it. Big credits were voted and there
was every prospect of Bizerta becom
ing the finest naval station in the Medi

Ministry bring about different Ideas.
Works commenced at Bizerta are al

Government support was accorded an
enterprising French company, encour
aged by the late Admiral Ponty and a
former Minister of Marine, which
opened a large coal depot and erected
important fuel works at very great ex

fuel, which fulfilled the exacting re
quirements of the French Government
arsenal authorities at Toulon.â -London
Globe. ':C^-
One of the chief reasons of the want
of success in French colonies Is no
doubt that the capitalists of the moth
er country will not Invest their money
in the colonies. Added to this, money
made in a colony is not spent there. To
begin with, the highly paid officials,
from the Governor General down, all
seem to economize, the utmost possible
for eleven months in the year in order
to pass one month every year in the
mother country, where they leave their
economies, to the detriment of the col
ony. Still In this instance the mother
country is not an actual loser.
Turning to the European working
class In Tunisia, the best part of which
is Italian and Sicilian, these people live
very economically and send all their
spare cash home. i. e.. to Italy or Sicily.
Take, for Instance, the Italian mason,
who may earn 3*Â£ francs a day. He
nourishes bodily on macaroni and the
like at' a ccst of half a franc a day,
putting by the 3 francs profit on hi3
day's work to send home to his father
land from time to time. The French la
boring classes are not sufficiently en
couraged. The employers of labor en
gage the cheapest obtainable, regard
less that a good French workman will
do 50 per cent more work than an
Italian or Sicilian for his 25 per cent
more wages.
Then we come to the administrative
or governing departments.. There are
numberless .administrations. Without
doubt they 'do give no end of work in
making commerce as difficult as pos
sible with their restrictions and for
malities In the way of all new enter
prise. The mistake is made by subsi
dizing such big undertakings as - rail
ways, mailboat service, etc., by guaran
teeing their profits at a certain figure."
The result is that these subsidized un
dertakings realize that the more they
gain the less subsidy they receive, and
consequently they are content to do
just what they have undertaken to do
for the subsidy, and give themselves
the least possible "ennui" without con
sideration for the commercial interest
of the colony.

Some people think that there are only
two or three kinds of bees â the honey
bee, the bumble bee and possibly one
kind of smaller wild bee. So far is this
from being true that no less than 1878
different species of wild bees have been
described from North America, that is,
including all of the country north of
â¢Panama, up to the present day. When
we come to study the habits and struc
ture of all these bees, says the Colo
rado College Museum Bulletin, it is
possible to understand why they are so 4
numerous in kinds. The pollen of flow
ers has to be carried principally by in
sects; that of one flower ta other flow
ers of the same sort, in order to bring
about the fertilization and production
of seed. Of all the insect carriers the j
bees are the most important. They \
visit the flowers for nectar and pollen,
to store up in nests for their young,
and when so^doing they carry the dust
like pollen from flower to flower, leav
ing a little of that previously gathered
each time they alight on a blossom, j
Now suppose that all bees visited in- j
discriminately every sort of flower, it
would continually happen that the
pollen of one species of plant would be
left on the flower of quite a different
species, where it would be altogether
useless. It Is desirable, therefore, that
each kind of bee should visit one par
ticular kind of plant, or at any rate
should prefer certain kinds. This we/
find to be more or less the case, and
there are many bees that never visit
more than one sort of flower. The num- \
ber of different kinds of flowers is very i
great, and consequently it is not sur- j
prising to find that there are many I
sorts of bees. Described North Amer
ican bees are so numerous, it Is prac
tically certain that we do not know
harf of those existing. Indeed, it is not
Impossible that the North American
continent, with the West Indies, pos
sesses as many as 5000 species. Thus
the opportunity for the student of
th^e insects is very great. He is ab
soluSely certain to find in almost any
part of the country species wholly new
to science during his first season's col
lecting. In Colorado I am sure that al
most any spring and summer day de
voted to the search would yield new
kinds. In New Mexico, up to to-day. '
508 species have been found, and of
these I have been able to describe 315;

ST. LOUIS, July 11. â The County
Commissioners from California and the
State Commissioners, who have not
been on the best of terms- with each
other almost since the opening of the
exhibition, had it out this afternoon
and, after a sensational scrimmage, a
better understanding than has hereto
fore existed was reached. It is be
lieved that harmony, or at least a state
of peace, has. been firmly established
for the rest of the fair.
To-day's battle came up on an inci
dent that , it had been supposed was
closed. The County Commissioners,
before the opening of the fair,, re
quested the State commission to apply
for permission for them to ride in the
opening day parade, as a matter of
courtesy. California being the only
State represented by counties. Com
migsioners Wiggins and Filcher agreed
to make the application and later in
formed the County Commissioners
that their request had been turned
down.
It was learned later that the turning
down had been done at the request of
the State commission. Charles M.
Reeves, director of State and Terri
torial exploration, signed a statement
to this effect, which was kept on file by
the county organization. Various small
matters caused friction, and when Sec
retary Willis resigned the stories of his
alleged ill treatment created a senti
ment of sympathy for him among the
County Commissioners.
To-day it was stated to some of the
county men that Commissioner Wig
gins had deliberately telephoned to
Reeves, telling him to Ignore the re
quest that the county men be allowed
to enter the parade. One of the Coun
ty Commissioners demanded a final ex-

Corral will in the near, future be the
President, for President Diaz is failing
rapidly'and is going to retire in reality,
though he will nominally be the Presi
dent. In doing this he will be relieved
of the arduous duties of office and
will at the same time satisfy the peo

believed that Governor Miguel Ahu

elected as Corral's successor as Minis

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call,
Arvisu fell in his tracks and the
American started to run, but was over
hauled by Rafael Topez, a member of
the force, and Jose Garcia, who had
been attracted by the shooting. ' They
tried to Intercept the American, who
again brought his gun into play and
shot the second officer dead. Garcia
no longer showed a desire to Interfere
and allowed the American to escape.
Although. the clew has been followed
up, the officers have been unable to
locate the man who did the shooting.
It Is the general belief that when
halted by Arvisu he thought a high
wayman was trying to run a bluff and
he took extreme measures.
The man who did the shooting was
an American miner and the circum
stances go ta show that it was largely
an accident. Arvisu was patrolling the
streets of the Gulch *, at a late hour
when he came upon the American, who
was carrying a mysterious bundle. The
night captain suspected him Â¦ and
halted him, asking him what the bundle
contained. He was told that it held
only some drills and mining tools;
but when, still suspicious, he ordered
the miner to turn them. over, the un
expected happened. The American
drew a gun and put a bullet through
the night captain before he could bring
his own gun into play.

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
ONE OF DR. CUPID'S PRESCRIPTION
That Love sometimes enres disease is a
fact that has recently been called to the
attention of the public by a prominent
physician and college professor. In some
nervous diseases of women, such as hys-
teria, this physician gives instances where
women were pnt in a pleasant frame of
mind, were made Happy by falling in love,
and in consequence were cared of their
nenrotis troubles â the weak, nervous sys-
tem toned and stimulated by little Dc
Cupid â became strong and vigorous, al-
most without their knowledge. Many a
woman is nervous and irritable, feels drag-
ged down and worn out, for no reason that
she can think of. She may be ever so
much in love, bnt Dr. Cupid fails to cure
her. In ninety -nine per cent, of these
cases it is the womanly organism which
requires attention; the weak back, dizzy
spells and black circles about the eyes, are
only symptoms. Go to the source of the
trouble and correct the irregularities, the
drains on the womanly system and the
other symptoms disappear. So sure of it
is the World's Dispensary Medical Associa-
tion, proprietors of Dr. Pierce 's Favorite
Prescription, that they offer a $500 reward
for women who cannot be cured of leucor-
rhea, female weakness, prolapsus, or fall-
ing of the womb. All they ask is a fair
and reasonable trial of their means of cure.
Dr. Pierce 's Pleasant Pellets clear the
complexion and sweeten the breath, they
' cleanse and regulate the stomach, liver and
Â¦ bowels and produce permanent benefit and
' do not re-act on the system. ' One is a

The coming big field exercises at
Camp Atascadero are monopolizing
practically all the attention of officers
in command of the different depart
ments located at army headquarters
and at the Presidio. The maneuvers
of the combined forces of , the United
States Government of this department
and the militia of the State in accord
ance with the plans mapped out by
General Mac Arthur are to be of a
dignified character.
The exercises are in no way to smack
of a picnic party. Absolutely no con
cessions are to be granted to any one
desiring to locate upon the . scene of
action to sell wares of any kind. Ap
plication after application has been
showered on General MacArthur for
such privileges, but in every instance
they have been denied. To eliminate
any possible of such a con
tingent a picket guard will be estab
lished around the camp.
The Government has empowered Gen
eral MacArthur to arrange for every
convenience that can be accorded to
officers and enlisted men in camp life,
regulars and militia to meet on an ac
tually equal footing.
. Every comfort will be extended to
the National Guard in accordance with
regulations of army life. The same
rations and commissary privileges that
the regulars enjoy will be extended to
the State militia.
The regulars are under orders to be
in camp by the night of August 8. So
soon as the State militia reports to the
camp, which will be on ot about Aug
ust 13, their standing will be the same,
with reference to duty and all features
of camp life, as , that of the regular
troops. The duties will not be ardu
ous, being confined to the general de
tail of camp life.
During: the two weeks' encampment
there will be a number of brattle ex
ercises, but these will not be intended
as a showcard of the encampment. The
idea of this big rendezvous is to give
the soldiers of the State^ a genuine
idea of army life, and. to bring both
forces into close and friendly com
munion.
Thii great body of soldiers, number
ing about 6000, will be divided into two
brigades. , The first brigade -will be
commanded by Colonel Alfred ' v;
Markley of the Thirteenth Infantry. It
will consist of the First Provisional
Regiment, under command of Colonel
William L. Pitcher. This regiment will
be composed of companies from the
Regulars and State Militia
Will Meet on Same Foot
ing at Camp Atascadero
Tenth, Thirteenth and Twenty-eighth
Infantry, being twelve companies all
told, together with the band of the
Thirteenth Infantry and Hospital
Corpo. the Second California Infantry
consisting of nine companies, band and
Hospital Corps, the First California
Infantry, consisting of eight companies,
band and Hospital Corps, and the Fifth
California Infantry consisting of nine
companies, band and Hospital Corps.
The second brigade will be under
command of Colonel Henry C. Ward
of the Fifteenth Infantry. This will
include the entire regiment of the
Fifteenth Infantry, band and Hospital
Corps, the Sixth California Infantry of
nine companies, band and Hospital
Corps, the Seventh California Infantry

Bengh, incarcerated in the County Jail
here on a charge of grand -larceny, is

rugs and furnishings of his rooms to
certain persons in order that they
might raise $500 for his bail and he
has not heard from them. The police
received an anonymous postal card to

Grand Army Veteran Dies.
SAN JOSE. July 11. â Albert Wink
elman. Grand Army veteran, was

He had been five days. Death
was probably due to heart disease. He
was employed aa a gardener by C. T.
Park, the banker.
"No graver mistake was ever made
than t J give universal suffrage to the
Hawaiian natives," said Professor
Moscf. "They were a more or less ig
norant people, having little: learning
and no knowledge at all of civilized
government. They had never had a po
litical training and could not be expect
ed to know the significance of the bal
lot. Totn'Â«* them with the ballot was
a* very Unwise thing from my point of
view. And I have no doubt that the
ruling classes in the islands have the
same view, for they know the condi
tions better.
"All the internal troubles of the Ha
waiian government are due to this mis
take. The native and his sympathizers
are in the majority, and the result is
that the representatives they, choose
are not of the best. .There is a bitter
antagonism between the two classes in
the islands.
"There is a sentiment in this country
at the present time that one man is as
uteful politically as another. That is
probably why the suffrage was given
to the Hawaiians. If this equality is
ever realized It will be the greatest
historical event from the beginning of
the world to the present time. It may
be realized some time, but it is too
early yet."
The enfranchisement of the natives of
Hawaii with the full rights of Buffrage
when the United States accepted the
islands as part ot the national territo
ry is regarded by Professor Bernard
Moses, professor of history at the Uni
versity of California and formerly a
Philippine Commissioner, as one of the
gravest oolitical mistakes this country
has ever committed. In a lecture before
his class to-day at the university Pro
fessor Moses criticized severely the
granting of the high privilege of suf
frage to a class of people who had no
conception of government in the sense
obtaining among the educated masses
of the United States.

pressed for his recovery.
So far as the children's parents could
learn, the older boy did not know that
the weapon was loaded. He and his
little brother had found the gun stand

weapon outside, and not until the ex

realize what danger they were In. '

As quickly as possible a physician was

The play In it3 construction shows
the skill of the trained actor, while
the story itself, dealing with a love
Ftory of the Spanish war, but harking
back in the plot to the war of the re
bellion, is of unusual dramatic force
and action. Its leading situation is
one of the strongest in modern drama.
A soldier of the South, who is wound
ed in the head during the old war,
has lived only in the days of the early
'60's. is brought back to the present
day through the skill of a Northern
surgeon and prepares to lead a charge
of the American troops against the
Spaniards under his old battle flag,
believing himself back in the days
of Lookout Mountain. Mr. Collins, in
the character of the young surgeon,
made a marked hit. The piece prom
ises to win much credit for its Cal
ifornia author. "'-V â¢.

BERKELEY, July 11.â A sequel to
the recent cutting of five elm trees
on Center street in violation of a town
ordinance was provided to-night when
a committee of the Town and Gown
Club furnished the Board of Trustees
with suggestions on the subject of tree
destruction in ii communication signed
by the president and members of. $he
civic section of the club. It was the
club that took up the cause of ahe
trees when they were cut two weeks
ago and threatened to prosecute the
destroyer, although things were after
ward smoothed over.
Now the Town and Gown women
want two things done to the ordinance
that regulates the cutting of. trees and
in seeking to have it amended they
believe they are going to conserve the
best interests of the town. 'First, they
want the ordinance amended so if any
body does want to cut o. tree down he
may <Jo so without going to jail for it.
The ordinance is now so framed that
it does'not allow any; exceptions. Sec
ond, they w.ant only the Board of
Trustees to issue permits to cut down
trees, "consent to be given only after
a careful investigation and vote of the
board. The request for these changes
Is signed by Mrs. J. C. Lynch, presi
dent of the club; Mrs. A. J. Ralston,
chairman of the civic section; Mrs.
Frank H. Payne, Mrs. K/ A. Eaaton
and Mrs. Allen G. Freeman. The
Trustees assigned the communication

who wctp passing the Hoffman home,
rus-hed to the assistance of the little
girl and, securing a blanket from th Â»
house, smothered the flames. Dr. R. T.
Stratton was sent for ~at once, and h-?
found the child's injuries so serious
that ho ordered her removed to Provi
dence HoFi'Jtal.
Later the surgeons decided that skin
grafting would be necessary to save
her life, and then it was that her
brother came forward and offered his
own cuticle to cover the burns of his
sister. The youthful patients are both
doing well. The boy is very modest
and sees nothing heroic in his action.
He said to-day:
The cio<jiorÂ» safd that Alire would <ii#> if thÂ»

ekin, fo I loM thesn they could r.]vÂ»rÂ»te on me

from my legs. I did net bÂ«? how much they

Am far as that goe?, there was nothing dse to
dO. V
Tho accident which .nearly cost Alice
Hoffman her l'.fe. and whkh incident
ally made her brother a h^ro, happened
about three weeks ago. The little girl
came home from school while all th-?
members of the family were absent
and in trying: to amuse h-.Â»rsÂ°!f until
their return she bewail to curl her hair
in front of a mirror as fh" had ?e?n
her mother do. In order to heat the
curling irons she lighted two candles,
one of which upset and fell to the
floor. In picking up the candle the
child set her clothing on lire and -in
a moment Bhe was enveloped in flames.
She ran screaming to the front of the
house and fell exhausted on the porch.
George Hoffman, the 16-year-old son
of Louis Hoffman, a veteran member
of the Oakland Fire Department, vol
untarily sacrificed more than eighty
square inches of his own skin last
Tuesday in order to save the life of
his 6-year-old sister Alice. The girl
was severely burned three weeks ago
at the family home, 1213 Seventh street.
The Ramef. which nearly robbed the
little one of her life, destroyed all the
skin on her right arm and shoulder,
and it was to replace this that h^r
brother heroically submitted to the op
eration^ allowing the surgeons to strip
preat patches of cuticle from both his
thighs. His own suffering did not com
mence however, until after the op
eration, but now the great wounds on
his lower limbs are so painful that he
is forced to remain quiet mo~t of the
time, and when he docs move it is with
the aid of crutches.

The matter of property â¢ rights has
been satisfactorily settled between
Jack London, the author, and his wife,
who is suing him for divorce on the
ground of desertion. An order was
made by Judge Greene to-day vacating
an order made some time ago restrain
ing London from drawing any money
from publishers and employers upon
the statement of Mrs. London's attor
ney that the object of having the order
made has been attained.
So far London has made no appear
ance in the suit and the withdrawal of
the restraining order and the quick
compromise of all property rights is
taken as an indication that no contest
is to- be made in the case 'and that
London will allow his wife to secure
her decree without molestation. This
is as he wishes it, according to charges
made which state that he has request;
ed her to get the decree and give him
his liberty.
Mrs. London has alleged that the af
fections of her husband have been
alienated by Miss Strunsky .and. that
she once found Miss Strunsky seated
on her husband's knee, during the time
the latter was staying at the London
bungalow in Piedmont.
When the year was up from the date
upon which London and his wife sep
arated he wrote from Asia, it is as
serted by Mrs. London, and asked her
to give him his freedom. While she
had it in her hands tu give him his
liberty or not, he thought for their
mutual happiness this should be done,
tb.9 intimation being that he loved
another woman.
In conversation Dr. Ostwald said in
English that was more or less broken
that the trip across the sea and land
had cost him fourteen days of precious
time. The sights in America were a
revelation to him, this being his first
visit to the country. As to his studies
here Dr. Ostwald was not prepared
to say what course they would take
except that they would concern the
examination of heliotropism in animals,
which is one of the important ques
tions biological sience Is interested In.
Dr. Ostwald's father visited the uni
versity last year at i'\e request of Dr.
Loeb, his former pupil, and delivered
the address at the dedication of the
Loeb physiological laboratory,
Dr. Wolf v Ostwald, son of Professor
Wilhelm Ostwald, the world's great
est chemist, arrived from his home in
Germany to-day, prepared to begin a
course of study under Professor
Jacques Loeb, the great biologist. The
young man is a scientist ot consider
able note In his own country, and ,is
the master of a number of notable
achievements in biology, in which sub
ject he is greatly interested. In addi
tion to his researches he has been ac
tive in other pursuits, being a lieu

With that Police Judge George Sam
uels to-dav fined O. Babeno, a liquor
dealer at Third and Market streets,
$250 after his conviction on a charge of
selling liquors to five girls who were
less than sixteen years of age. '
"A saloon-keeper .. who allows boys
and girls in the back rooms of his
resort, as this man has done, cannot
be tolerated. No reputable saloon man
would for a moment permit such a
thing," declared his Honor. Â¦
Babeno's conviction carries with-it,
under the city charter, a forfeiture of
his license to conduct business ' and
also his bond of $1000. ..The Police
Commissioners have ordered that the
Chief of Police proceed against the
man. The flÂ«e was paid.

yourself, but to all saloon men who

SHOOTS CHILD
IN THE HEAD
Six youthful burglars awoke in cells
in the" City Prison this morning. They
were taken into, custody Jjy the police
during the night.
The lads range in age from 10 to 17.
George Ash, 10 years; Arthur Fred
erick, 13 years, and George Audet, 14,
were first made prisoners. They had
robbed a store on Jefferson street near
Fourth. Willie Jacobs,'. 17 years old;
George Mate, 15 years, and William
Davis, 16, were arrested during the
early morning hours with stolen goods
In their possession and could give no
satisfactory explanation.
About 9 o'clock last evening Ash,
Frederick . and Audet broke into the
store of Mrs. R. Appledorn and took a
quantity of sardines, oysters and to
bacco. The youngest of the trio was
the first to enter the place and told his
companions of the possibilities for a
feast. While all were enjoying an im
prom,ptu "spread," the police swooped
down and the juvenile thieves went to
the City Prison. This morning Ash, on
account of his tender years, was re-,
leased and sent home. The other boys
will be held to answer for their crime.
Police Sergeant Lynch came upon
the other trio at the corner of Six
teenth and Peralta streets about 3
o'clock in the morning. They had
three quart bottles of whisky, a new
alarm clock and a dozen handkerchiefs
in their, possession. As the lads will
offer no explanation, the detective de
partment is attempting to trace the
ownership of the stolen articles. Â¦

Colonel E. W. Maslin declared that
the adoption of -a freeholder charter
would prevent annexation. Others who
spoke were F. X. Delanoy, P. \V. Bar
ton and E. R. Anthony.
"Oakland wants us and will eventu
ally ?ret us if we do not fight this move
ment tooth and nail," said Charles S.
Neal. "I have not as much confidence
as to what the Legislature might do as
has Simrson. Unless we organize and
oppose annexation the time will come
when strangers will take our home city
from us."
Judge R. B. Tappan asserted that
Alam-'dans are proud of their city and
its government and did not feel that
their condition could in any. way be im
proved by joining Oakland.
"This is cur homp." said Judge Tap
pan, "and there is no place like home.*"
George Renner said he was against
annexation until it could be proven
lhat Alameda would derive some bene
fit by becoming a part of Oakland.
President George W. Scott of the
Advancement Association directed the
discussion and announced at the open
ing of the meeting that the board of
directors cf the organization were un
alterably opposed to the consolidation
of Alameda with any other municipal
ity.
City Attorney M. W. Simpson gave it
as his opinion that the adoption of a
freeholders' charter would not protect
Alamoda from being: swallowed up by
the larger city across the estuary, S/Ut
he said that he was not inclined to
think that the Legislature would pass
any enabling act that would permit
Oakland to annex Alameda without the
consent of the majority of voters of this
city.
ALAMEDA. July 11.â Consolidation
of this cit;- with Oakland and Berkeley
was discussed at a meeting: of the Ala
meda Advancement Association to
ni^ht, and at the conclusion of the
speaking a vote was taken, which
showed that the 200 persons in attend
ance were unanimously opposed to the
project.

The figures of the Registrar show
twice the number of voters registered
this month over those of 1902; that is,
47,533 as against 20,434, at this time
two years ago. This is accounted for
by the fact that there was no primary
election held two years ago, just prior
to September. The total registration
in 1902 was 80,000.
The registration this year is 47,000
to date, leaving a balance of 32,500
voters to register before September
of this year to equal the registration
of two years ago.
The registration office will be open
evenings from 7:30 to 10 o'clock to
allow for the registration for the pri
maries, which take place July 20.

TOPEKA, Kans., July 11.â An orderly
"mob" of about twenty-five reputable
citizens of North Topeka took a Union
Pacific work train this afternoon, went
four miles west of town and with picks
and shovels dug a ditch three feet wide
and seventv-flve f,eet long through the
railroad embankment. This was done
to allow the stored flood water to es
cape to the river instead of running
through the town. The members of the
"mob" then quietly returned to their
homes. Another expedition was made
in a similar manner against the Santa
Fe tracks east of town. A gang of sec
tion men were working there, but they
made no opposition to the tearing out
of- a section of the embankment.
The Santa Fe fast mail between Kan
sas City and Topeka was annulled this
morning on account of the soft tracks.
Otherwise that system has resumed
service on the main line and nearly all
its branches in Kansas.

Creek after the explosioq, was arrested
on a ranch near Rye Station. The
Sheriff said that Skelton had talked a
great deal about the explosion, but
he did not know what evidence had
been obtained to connect him with the
crime. Skelton protests his innocence
and says he will have no difficulty In
proving an alibi.
Upon complaint sworn out by S. H.
Phipps a direct information was filed
to-day in the District Court charging
Frank Cochran, secretary of the Vic
tor Miners' Union, Arthur Parker, Al
bert Carrington, Thomas McManus.
Richard James, John James, Edward
McKelvey and Alfred Miller with con
spiracy to kill Roscoe McGee, who was
shot and instantly killed in the Victor
street fight June 6. All of these men
are now In jail here.
The warrant for the arrest of Skel
ton was sworn out by Sheriff Bell, who
had received information that Skelton
had been boasting that he knew whÂ«
caused the explosion at Independence.
Skelton was a member of the Free
Coinage Miners' Union and has worked
in several mines in the district.
Animated caucuses were held all over
the block throughout the entire even
ing. The meeting will adjourn when
the building catches fire.
Just what party, if any, these "Na
tive Sons" will support they will not
state! But they emphatically denied
that they were Prohibitionists. There
are, about 700 in the organization.
Ng Chung had the floor for two hours
and a half. His subject was "The Full
Chow Basket." When he alluded to
that great patriot, Georgie Wah Sing
Ton, Who "no sabe talkee lie" a China
man in purple bloomers arose. "Me
saj?e Wah Sing Ton. He my cousin.
He live Oakland. He work in saloon.
He alle lime talkee lie."
An executive committee was ap
pointed, consisting of Lee Sing Sz, To
Chiu and Leung Chung. These names
are pronounced with three coughs and
a sneeze.
The object of the meeting to pro
vide so that the voting population of
Chinatown may get its rights on elec
tion day. No one in the assemblage
was certain as to what the rights in
question are, but from the "chin chin"
that is still disturbing Commercial
street it is thought that the Celestials
are going to get their rights or start
something.
Seung Kwai Pak opened the meeting
with a detailed lecture on marking a
ballot. Quite a sensation was caused
when he explained that this game dif
fered slightly from marking a lottery
ticket. One venerable Asiatic who has'
been waiting patiently since last elec
tion to get a line on the drawings of
the last ballot marking went home in
disgust.
Somewhat on the plan of the St.
Louis convention is the political meet
ing of the Chinese Native Sons that
started last night in the assembly hall
of the Six Companies. It will probably
last as long as the celebrated Chinese
play, "The Purple Nosed Dragon and
the Bow-Legged Daughter of the Son
of the Stars." The grandson of. the
leading man who began this famous
drama is only in the five hundred and
eighty-seventh act.
ST. LOUIS, 'July 11.â A terrific storm
of wind, rain and hail prevailed in St.
Louis and vicinity for a short time this
afternoon, causing considerable damaga
to property. One man waa killed by
lightning and five others were injured
by flying missiles. The maximum
reached by the wind was sixty-five
miles an hour, but this velocity was
sustained for onlv a minute or two. or
the damage might have been much
greater. The average velocity waa
about forty-eight miles an hour.
Twelve barges were blown across the
river and eighteen or twenty houses on
Twenty-first street, between Washing
ton and Carr streets, were completely
unroofed, and other damage was done
throughout the city. Some of the hail
sfones that fell during the storm meas
ured an inch in diameter.
LIXCOLX. Neb., July 11.â A tornado
last night destroyed several* barns and
outb^ldings near BurwelL The build
ings on Mr. Brittain's farm were re
duced to splinters. No lives were lost.
The list of injured is not obtainable.
Severe hailstorms ruined crops at
Greeley Center, near Ord. at Hastings
and at Arcadia.

LOS AXGELES, July 11.â Although
San FTancisco and the north will have
much to do with the election of a
United States Senator to succeed
Thomas R. Bard, whether he succeeds
himself or not, Los Angeles will be the
center of the open shows of strength.
That is to say, from here will be made
the announcements of the seemingly
relative positions' of those in the race at
the various posts along the course,
and meantime each of the candidates
will be pulling all available wires else
where, hiding all possible cards and
otherwise endeavoring to secure votes
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., July . 11.â Union
leaders of the packing-house employes
in South St. Joseph say to-night that
all union men in the four plants will
strike to-morrow, according to advices
received from the national officers. Six
thousand men are employed.
KANSAS CITY, July 11.â The execu
tive committee of the various unions of
the two Kansas Cities that owe al
legiance to the . Amalgamated Meat
Cutters' and Butcher Workmen's Union
met in Kansas City, Kans., to-night
and received final instructions as to
the strike in- the packing- houses which
had been called for to-morrow. One
thousand men attended the meeting.
When the telegram ordering a strike
was received the men arose and
cheered. _^_
OMAHA, July 11.â The packing-house
managers of South Omaha have noti
fied the commission men that there will
be no livestock market on Tuesday, on
account of the threatened strike of
400C packing-house employes. This
notice was given early to-day in order
that commission-house men might
notify shippers to withhold shipments
of livestock to this market until the
threatened troubles were settled. It is
understood that the local packing
house men have received orders to
strike at noon to-morrow. This order,
however, is conditioned on further in
structions from Chicago, -where nego
tiations are in progress.
One of the large packing-house man
agers stated to-night that, although
there would be no market to-morrow,
his plant would remain open and give
employment to all men who did not
Jcln the strikers in case of a walkout.
-Finally it was decided by the officers
of the unions to take a referendum
upon the question of calling a strike
to enforce the demands. Before issu
ing the order to-night for the strike to
morrow, Donnelly said that meetings
similar to the one held to-night had
been held in other cities where the
companies have branches and that at
all of these meetings the vote resulted
in favor of a general strike.
In addition to the large firms al
ready named, the following concerns
will be affected if a strike' is started:
St. Louis Dressed Beef Company, East
St. Louis; Fowler Packing Company
and Ruddy Brothers, Kansas City, and
a number of smaller distributing
houses throughout the East.
Later a proposal came from the*pack
ers offering 17M> cents an hour for la
borers. This proposal was rejected by
the unions, and, although several other
conferences were held, no agreement
could be reached.
The butcher workmen at a recent
convention decided that a minimum
wage of 20 cents an hour for common
labor should prevail in the packing
centers, and that the wages of the
skilled workers should be equalized in
each branch of the trade. Wage scales
wpre arranged by the different unions
on the basis adopted by the conven
tion, but a number of conferences with
the packers failed of reaching any
agreement.
"For nearly two months we have
been carrying on negotiations with the
committee of superintendents repre
senting the packers, in order to secure
new agreements for our men. the old
contracts between the unions and the
companies having expired on Maji 2S.
Since that time we have been workins
without any agreement and have tried
in every way to reach a satisfactory
agreement with the packing interests,
but they have held out on every pro
posal we have submitted, refusing to
compromise in any way. Finally the
men became disgusted and to-night's
order for a general strike was the re
sult."
Superintendent J. J. Conway of Ar
mour & Co. made this statement:
"Neither side wants a strike. Cf that
there can be no doubt. While, so far
as I know, no arrangements have been
made fcr another meeting between the
representatives of the packers and of
the unions, still I think a further con
ference will be held to-morrow and in
all probability a satisfactory settle
ment of the difficulty will be reached."
The decision to ca!l a strike was
reached at a meeting of the Packing
Trades Council, called by the execu
tive officers of the different unions
v.-hose members are employed in the
packing plants to decide whether the
unions would continue negotiations for
the skilled men only, as proposed by
the packers' representatives, or wheth
er a strike would be called to enforce
the union demands for a minimum
wage fcr unskilled labor. The vote in
favor of a general strike was unani
mous.
CHICAGO, July 11.â A general strike
of the employes of all the big packing
plants throughout the country was or
dered to-night by Michael J. Donnelly,
president of the Amalgamated . Meat
Cutters and. Butcher Workmen of
America. Unless the packing com
panies offer some sort of a compromise
to the demands of the union the 49,600
workmen affected by the order will quit
to-morrow at noon. The strike involves
the following companies, which have
branches in Kansas City, St. Joseph,
St. Louis. Omaha. St. Paul, Fort Worth
and New York City: Armour & Co.,
Swift & Co., Xelson, Morris & Co.,
Bchwarzschlld & Sulzberger, Cudahy
Packing Company and the National
Packing Company. In Chicago alone
these companies employ more than 40.
000 men, all of whom will quit work at
the same time as at the packing houses
outside cf Chicago. In an interview to
nipht, Donnelly said:

There Is more or less talk about what
the "organization" intends to do. It
is said that interior members of the
Legislature will not declare a prefer
ence until the "organization" is heard
from. The assertion comes from the
headquarters of the Republican State
Central Committee that the party or
ganization, as represented by that
body, will not lend its support to any
aspirant for Senatorial honors. It ia
said that some knowledge in this re
spect was gained at Sacramento in
1899, when a branch of the committee
established headquarters in the Golden
Eagle Hotel and espoused the 'Sena
torial candidacy of D. M. Burns. '
Well informed politicians assert that
this talk about the "organization" Is
uttered to delude and mystify the
country candidates for the Legislature.
One of the talkers when hard pressed
for definite information regarding the
existence of an "organization" replied
that whoever Jere Burke, John C.
Lynch, George Hatton and Arthur
Fisk indorsed would be the man for
Senator. The information comes to
The Call from nearly all the leading
counties of the' State that the Repub
lican voters intend to elect to the Leg
islature men who will not take orders
from any self-constituted organization.
There Is no indication at the present
time of any purpose or desire on the
part of the railway or other corpora
tions to meddle In the Senatorial cam
paign.
THE ORGANIZATION.
Judge J. W. McKinley, chairman of
the California delegation in. the late
Republican National Convention* ar
rived in the city yesterday on his re
turn trip to Los Angeles, and at once
declared himself in favor of Frank P.
Flint for United States Senator to suc
ceed Thomas R. Bard. As Judge Mc-
Kinley is Mr. Flint's law partner in
Los Angeles the declaration does not
create special wonder.
Senator C. XV. Pendletqn of Los An
geles is in San Francisco studving the
Senatorial signs. If he can get a re
lease from Lankershin he will visit
the Flint camp.
State Senator Thomas Flint of San
Juan was at the Union League Club
yesterday. It is well kndwn that he
is partial to the candidacy of Senator
Bard, and entertains the belief that
the latter will win out in the south.
Senator Thomas Selvage of Humboldt
is also In town. He is classed as one
of the leaders of the Knight forces.
Four recognized candidates for \he
honor of representing California in the
Senate of the United States are now in
the field. Three of the aspirants.
Thomas R. Bard, Henry T. Oxnard and
Frank P. Flint, hall. from the south,
and It Is general gossip in political
camps that the solid support of South
ern California delegations will ulti
mately go to one of the three â the one
that develops the greatest strength in
the Legislature.
The candidacy of George A. Knight is
causing a deal of comment in political
circles. Common rumor is to the effect
that both Oxnard and Knight stand
h!gh in- the favor of President Roose
velt, but nobody expects the President
to indicate a preference for either. In
the Union League Club yesterday the
remark was made that George Knight
should post himself at once and ascer
tain how to pronounce the President's
name and not fall into the error of coo
ing the first syllable of Roosevelt.
Henry T. Oxnard makes no mistake
in pronouncing the President's name.
George Hatton, the manager of Mr.
Oxnard's Senatorial campaign, is not
disturbed in the slightest degree by the
reports of cordial friendship existing
between the President and Mr. Knight.
Mr. Hatton recalls the incident that
the President on his memorable visit
to California set aside the committee's
programme and went miles out of the
way on his special train to pay a visit
to his friend Oxnard at the town of
Oxnard. Mr. Knight, it is said, may
recall many demonstrations of Presi
dential regard, but he will have to get
a move on If he expects to outclass Ox
nard In this line of campaigning.

The new woman of Colorado has at last made her
progress and its method subjects of the most serious
judicial inquiry. One of the sex of Denver, politically
inclined and evidently earnest in the cause she espoused,
has been indicted by the Grand Jury for "repeating" at
an election. The lady has ample grounds to plead that
there is not a new woman alive who does not think that
she is plural and entitled to the consideration generally
accorded to numbers.
WITHIN the last five years there have been
more than a score of cases in this country of
poisoning by candy and liquor sent by mail.
Colorado was shaken up by a case of poisoning by
whisky sent by mail. But candy seems the favorite re
sort of the poisoners. We have a noted California case
of this kind, and since it occurred and had publicity
there have been three more cases here, though none
resulted in the death of the intended victim.
We do not use the term '"poisoned candy" with any
reference to the dangerous stuff found in most candy
by Chemist Wiley ot the Agricultural Department. It
is plain from his analysis that if the poisoners would
only wait a little the confectioners would do the job
with the parafnne and aniline used in making their candy.
But the desire for vengeance is too, impatient to wait,
and so these slow-death things are reinforced with
strychnine or arsenic and sent anonymously to the
victim, who immediately proceeds to gorge the stuff,
not knowing who sent it, or anything about it. only
that it is candy and a present and cost nothing. Then
the cater dies and the autopsy shows active and passive
poison and the ponderous machinery of the law is put
in motion to find the poisoner. This is a tale told again
and again in the newspapers, and yet the market for
poisoned candy, is as good as ever. People who will
read this would lay the paper down and sample a box
of chocolates that came by mail without knowing who
sent it. V~
The poisoner is the most execrated of all criminals
and those who eat candy that comes by mail, they know
not from whom, are the most to be condemned of all
fools. It is just possible that, in the great economy of
things, the poisoner is the fool-killer in disguise, for
surely no "person that knows enough to retire Jndoors
when it rains would touch stuff sent under such cir
cumstances. When a box of candy, with no sender's
name upon it. is received by, a person of sense it is
sent for analysis to a chemist and -everything about the
package that can identify the sender is carefully pre
served.. . Tn these days enmity takes novel shapes and
revenge is sought in. gruesome ways, and the easiest
seems to be the lure of a cheap box of candy. . .

Japanese Journalism is developing on
Western lines and with surprising rap
idity. The events of the present war
are responsible for extras which are
sold on the street in the American
fashion. The newsmen run barelegged,
with a sort of napkin round the head
and a srflall bell at the belt, which
rings as they go. "When the war news
is lively the extras come out in a cor
respondingly lively manner, one after
the other, and are liberally patronized.
The sensational reporter has appeared
there, as well as the female journalist,
and things are"whooped up" more than
they used to be. One consequence of
this is that journalism here and there
begins to pay, where formerly it had
to be subsidized as a matter of pat
riotism and public spirit. There is an
English column in all the papers, and
English is studied in all the schools.
The country has six hundred news
papers in all, and a number of them
have respectively a circulation exceed
ing a hundred thousand copies. As
guides and directors of public opinion
they are perhaps not inferior to our
own. Altogether Japanese journalism,
in its infancy, has a bright future be
'ore it, and will likely keep pace with
:ie progress of the country it serves.

A study has been made also of the flow of the Owens
River and its tributaries. Permanent gauging stations
have been established at Bishop, Rock and Pine creeks
and on the Owens River, and daily readings are taken
at all these stations. Irrigated land is being mapped and
the duty of water is being determined.
The present irrigation development is complimented
by Mr. Clausen, but the fact is also pointed out by him
that while some lands easily accessible by water are suf
fering from drought, other lands, by reason of waste, are
being converted into swamps. It is also estimated that
the efficiency of the existing canals can be increased
fifty per cent by judicious and economical management.
Tributary drainage areas will be investigated this sum
mer to ascertain where there are minor storages, with
the view of making them feeders to a main system.
Extensive developments of power are made feasible for
pumping by reason of the abrupt descent of the waters
on the eastern slope of the Sierras. Natural conditions
are favorable for securing irrigation, as they are in many
California valleys. Mr. Clausen says that the United
States Government intends, upon the approval of the
proper authorities, to reclaim the arid lands of the
Owens Valley.
The theme of Mr. Clausen is the latent wealth of
Owens Valley, in Inyo County, and the beneficial effect
that irrigation will have. Owens Valley is in about the
latitude of Fresno. It has a population of about 5000.
With the exception of ten per cent, who are engaged in
mining in the surrounding mountains, the population
is supported by agriculture and stock-raising as prac
ticed in the valley. Bishop is the largest town, with a
population of 600.
On the east of the valley are the White Mountains,
with an average elevation of 10,000 feet. On the west
the Sierra Nevadas form a barrier 12,000 feet high. The
valley floor is 4000 feet above the sea level. It is 100
miles 'long and about five miles wide. The Owens River
cuts it almost in halves. Owens River runs into Owens
Lake, for which there is no visible outlet. The waters
of the lake have become, by evaporation, a concentrated
solution of alkaline salts. The soil of the valley is en
tirely the result of the decomposition of the material
from the adjoining mountains, the wash from one side
being of granitic and from the other side of limestone
Â¦ origin. The resultant is a condition ripe for unusual
fertility. Water is the great desideratum. The rainfall
is very small and therefore irrigation is a necessity. The
climate is temperate and offers no impediment to thor
ough development. â¢
Mr. Clausen has been studying the region since June
1, 1903. He finds that green fields of alfalfa thrive
.where there were only sagebrush areas and prosperous
farms exist where once there was a desert. Water has
accomplished this and the way is clear for much greater
improvement to be brought about by scientific use of
water. A primary investigation has revealed that there
is a reservoir site at the lower end of Long Valley, in
the southern part of Mono County on the Owens River,
at an elevation of 7000 feet. The watershed tributary
to this site* contains about 300 square miles, having an
elevation of 7000 to 12,000 feet, and nearly all subject to
a heavy fall of snow.
IN the current number of Water and Forest, the offi
cial publication issued by the California Water and
, Forest Society, there is an article by J. C. Clausen
of the United States Reclamation Service, that is valu
able for the information it contains about a section of
California little known to the majority of citizens, and
by reason of inferences relating to other regions that
naturally spring from the conclusions entertained by the
writer.

TIME was that the Populist party was the object
of lively interest to politicians. It grew out of the
Farmers' Alliance, organized by that remarkable
man Polk, of North Carolina. He made every member
take an oath to hear speeches and read papers only of
Iheir side. Though this seems preposterous now,- it
succeeded in establishing that class feeling which Mr.
Bryan used adroitly in his two campaigns. The Populist
party continued the exclusive class policy instituted by
Polk, and came to embody all of the political fanaticism
of the country. Its Ocala and Omaha platforms were
the study of economists and publicists, for they mapped
out what would have been an entirely novel system of
government.
The Populists absorbed the Greenback party, and as
similated a considerable number of Socialists. Of course
such accessions added to the original stock of vagaries.
The Socialists brought in government ownership and di
rect legislation, and the G^eenbackers their airy fairy
theories of money. Any man who had a half-baked idea
that did not deserve baking at all found a place for it in
the Populist party. The queer combination was soon
increased by the accession of demagogues from both
parties. It is conceivable that "Whirlwind Davis" of
Texas could honestly believe that a proper financial sys
tem required that every man's note of hand be made a
legal tender, and that the volume of that kind of cur
rency should be limited only by the capacity of men to
emit notes of hand, but it is not conceivable that Mr.
Bryan and Senator Patterson of Colorado believed that
though they advocated it.
The party was propagated and grew in some direc
tions for various reasons. Five years' drought in Ne
braska and Kansas made most of the people poor, and
poverty is a condition in which vagaries flourish. Sena
tor Ingalls said that the people of Kansas hated Pullman
cars because they were an expression of luxury in which
only a few could indulge. Wherever drought laid its
dry hand or hard times pinched there Populism flour
ished as a protest against conditions that the people were
taught could be exorcised by artifice properly directed
In the South the rise of Populism was due to another
cause entirely. The race issue kept men from following
their convictions into the Republican party, while the
political tyranny of the Democratic organization roused
a genuine American protest against its intolerable ex
actions, of which Populism was the expression. Isham
G. Harris in Tennessee, Morgan in Alabama, Butler and
Wade Hampton in South Carolina, had held the reins so
tight that no ambitions were permitted in politics except
by their consent. The rise oi Tillman in South Carolina
was on the lines of Populism, and his declaration that
he would "give the one gallus men a chance" appealed
to the same sentiment that made Tom Watson possible
in Georgia.
So. it came to be the opinion of even wise men that
Populism had the elements of permanency and must be
reckoned with. While nothing is more sure than that
the party was the abnormal product of ephemeral con
ditions, and was bound to evaporate with its unsub
stantial cause, there is no doubt that its decay was has
tened by the fusions into which it was wooed by Mr.
Bryan. When it was sought and besought by the
Democracy the upstart party assumed airs, and
finding it could dictate proceeded t do so. In this
State it dictated to the Democracy the nomination of
Judge Maguire for Governor, and that of Marion Can
non for Congress, and success in issuing commands here
and elsewhere made it arrogant and purled up with
that pride that goeth before a fall.
Mr. Bryan was not benefited by fusion. The Popu
lists that were sent to Congress were amusing cranks,
with no capacity for the hard work that counts in that
body. They were the sort of men who whittle sticks
and talk and talk, and chew tobacco and spit and spit,
and have but one opinion in economics, which is to the
effect that any man who has gathered more gear than
they stole it from the people. Wherever the party got
; power it showed a vast incapacity for its responsibilities.
Its destructive ideas were definite. It hated all existing
institutions. But when it removed them what it pro
posed' to substitute was a structure that had existed only
in a hasheesh dream. It is no wonder, then, that the Na
tional Convention of the party, just held in Springfield,
III., had only two hundred delegates, representing a
minority of the States, and seemed to have met only
to sing the swan song of a party that once filled a vast
space in the political horizon. What is left of it is
mostly in the South, where it merely gives opportunity
to fight the regnant and reckless Democracy. If it
ever revive the germ will spread from that section.

the motion to modify the decree of di

The Joint committee will meet next
Monday night at 8 o'clock to consider
the amendments.
Braunhart said that a tax of So cents
on an assessed valuation of $500,000,000
would raise $4,250,000, and the income
from other source* would raise the total
t6 $6,000,000, or more than sufficient to
P8y the running expenses of the gov
ernment.
1 The second proposed amendment pro
1 vides that a new section be added to
article XII of the charter, to be num
bered section 15, to read as follows:
Whenever any water works gas works,
electric light works, steam, water or electric
P0Â«tr work*, telephone lines, street railroads,
or other public utilities shall be owned or
operated by the city and county of San Fran
cisco the earnings of each such utility shall
be kept In a separate fund and shall be ex
panded for the- following purposes and In the
following order: 1. To the current operating
expenses. 2. To Ihe maintenance oi the plant
and the repair and replacement of worn-out
machinery and material. 3. To the repayment
to the city treasury of moneys paid for ln
terebt and the redemption of bonds Issued for
the acquisition of such utility. 4. To a re
sctvc lurd. 5. To new construction. 0. To
the ceneral fund.
The reserve fund shall be constituted from
the surplus earnings of such public utility,
after providing for the payments under sub
division!* 1. 2 and 3 of this section. Such
surplus .Mrnlnes shall be paid Into the re
serve fund until such fund shall amount to
one-half of tbe payments under subdivisions
1. 2 and 3 for the preceding fiscal year, alter
which the surplus earnings may be set aside
by the Supervisors to the fund for new con
struction, or to t!w general fund of the city
and county. Whenever the earnings of any
public utility In any n>ca! year are in
efficient to meet the demands for the pur
poses set forth in subdivisions 1. 2 and 3. the
res-rrve lund may be used for the payment of,
Fuoh demands; ami should the reserve iund
b3 Insufficient to pay the fame then th? Board
of Supervisors mar appropriate from the gen
eral fund of the city and county a sum suf
ficient to meet such deficiency.
The provisions of section Â» of chapter I of
article XIII shall not apply to the fund of
any public utility or appropriation made
therefrom.
Any surplus remaining unexpended in said
public Improvement fund at the end of any
fiscal year shall be continued therein and bÂ«
subject to appropriation for any of the public
Improvements above specified. The Super
visors in making the levy shall apportion the
taxes to the several funds.
The Supervisor* may levy an additional tax
for a public improvement fund to meet ap
propriations for the acquisition, construction
or extension of any of the works described In
article XII of the charter, or for the laying
of new pavements or the construction of new
st-wers In accepted streets, or for the erection
ot public buildings; but such additional taxes
shall not In any one year exceed the sum of
lft cents on each J10O valuation of property
assessed.
Supervisor Braunhart yesterday sub
mitted to the Board of Supervisors two
proposed charter amendments, which
were referred to the joint Charter
Amendment and Finance Committee
for action. The first amendment relates
to a modification of the dollar limit
clause in section 2 chapter I of article
3, providing for the tax levy so that 85
cents of the levy shall be used for the
payment of all demands upon the
treasury, exclusive of the tax of 7 cents
for the maintenance of the park and
also of the tax for interest and sinking
funds of any bonded Indebtedness.
This proposed amendment also pro

A most Interesting account of the
deliberations of the General Assem
bly of the Presbyterian Church re
cently held in Buffalo, N. Y.. was given
by the Rev. George G. Eldredse be
fore the Presbyterian Ministers' As
sociation yesterday morning. The
speaker described the "Church Forms"
which cume under his observation at
Westminster Presbyterian Church.
Buffalo. There the "forms" we^e so
elaborate that he failed to recognize
thtm as Presbyterian. The communion
table was placed high and the minis
ter knelt at the table when he entered.
"While it was true that the min
ister faced the people during
service, . the Rev. Mr. Eldredge
thought that he would soon for-
Fet to do so. Dr. Van Dyke said
Mr. .Eldredge, had called it a "Dolly
Varden" service, and he had further de
scribed the whole affair as "high fly
ing." Mr. Eldredge did not know when
to sit or when to stand. He had al
ways dreaded anything that went to
ward "formalism" and ritualism.
The association elected officers for
the coming six months as follows; The
Rev. W. J. Fisher, president: the Rev.
H. E. Hayes, vice president; the Rev.
James Woodworth, treasurer and sec
retary, and the Rev. C. C. Herriott,
Rev. George C. Eldredge and Rev.
E. E. Clark, executive committee.
Dr. Matthew announced that inquiry
had been made regarding Mr. Gross,
an inmate of the Almshouse, who, it
ha-3 been alleged, was at one time a
Methodist minister. Nothing had been
learned as to Mr. Gross having been
connected with the Methodist church
as a minister, but it was stated that
ho had probably at some time been n
preacher. He is SS years of age, and
Inquiry at the Almshouse developed the
information that he Is ailowed neither
sugar nor butter with his food, anil
his pillow and bed are hard and un
comfortable.
The association decided to take the
matter up at once and see that he has
whatever may be needed for his com
fort. The HÂ«vJ A. C. Bane, the Rev.
i'r. Keast and the.Rtv. Dr. Brown
wore appointed *a committee to continue
an investigation into the matter and do
all in their power for the aged preacher.
The Rev. Edwin H. Hadlock of Mas
rachusetts, latelv created field secre
tary of the California Christian En
deavor Society's work, spoke before the
Congregational Ministers' Association
yesterday and told of the Increasing
influence of the society. The Rev. Dr.
Bare also spoke.
The Christian Church Ministers'
meeting was he!d In the Y. M.- C. A.
building yesterday and was largely at

dent, was in the chair. A resolution
was unanimously adopted expressing
appreciation of s the faithful services

Booker T. Washington spends for the sup
port of the Tuskegee Institute and the edu
cation of 1MO studtntu as much as the Freed
rr.an's Aid and Southern Education Society of
the Methodist Episcopal church is spending
for the support of forty-one institutions and
the education of 12,000 students. Neverthe
less Washington Is doing a splendid work lor
his people " and ought to be encouraged In It.
He has incurred the criticism of many In
telligent colored people because be has ad
vocated industrial education somewhat at the
expense of a literary training.
While there has been a great effort to
improve the condition of the colored people
since the war, yet with the means at our
command we have hardly kept pace with the
increase of the population. Â¦ Those of the
colored people whem we have been able to
reach have responded nobly, and almost with
out exception they are leading good and hon
orable lives. The colored people of the South
who are giving trouble are those who have
not had the benefit of education. However,
there Is nothing to fear In the colored man;
if educated he is trustworthy. He Is with
out representation In the press and Is often
misunderstood and misrenorted.
As regards his social standing, that is
purely a personal matter. But the colored
people arc not arplring to social equality.
All the colored man wants Is a fair chance
with othar American citizens.
"There is nothing to fear in th*e col
ored man. If educated he is trust
worthy," said Dr. L. M. Dunton, presi
dent of Claflln University, Orange
burg, S. C, yesterday to the members
of the Methodist Ministers' Associa
tion, which met at Epworth Hall.
Discussing the question and describ
ing the education given at the univer
sity over which he presides. Dr. Dun
ton said:
The negro problem is one which is engaging
tbe attention of the thoughtful people of the
land. Education la what Is essential toward
their upbuilding. We are giving not only a.
literary but also an Industrial education in
our Institution, where we teach twelve dif
ferent trades.
Francis J. Burke, who is employed
In the City Hall, admits that he re
ceived a fee of 530 from Mrs. Mc-
Crystle a year ago to procure her di
vorce. He had just been admitted to
the bar and he says he soon became
fo entanjcled in the meshes of the law
that it was impossible to extricate
himself. He admits sending the inter
locutory decree but was reticent about
explaining how he obtained it. Kehoe.
Mrs. McCrystle's lawyer, came to the
city to settle the affair and told Burke
that Mrs. McCrystle would be satis
fied with the return of the 530. Burke
promised to send the money, but, being
hard pressed, failed to do so. He says
it is a proposition of giving the case
notoriety to enforce payment.
A few months ago 6he came to Hum
bo!Â«t and since that time Burke has
fcrwaxded her an Interlocutory decree
of divorce. She was under the impres
sion that the final decree would be
forthcoming shortly. Tu be sure of
her case she called upon Attorney "W.
Kehoe of this city and he decided upon
looking at the Interlocutory decree that
everything was regular, but as he
shortly after that went to San Fran
cisco, he looked Into the matter and
found that Mrs. McCrystle has been
duped. No such case had ever been
started In San Francisco and the de
cree was a bogus one. Kehoe called
upon Burke and confronted him with
the facts he had secured and Burke
acknowledged his duplicity and prom
ised to reimburse his victim. Mrs. Mc-
Crystle will not prosecute Burke un
less he fails to- make good all payments
she has made to him.

EUREKA. July 11.â There was filed
here Saturday a divorce suit which is
the sequel of an interesting story. The
euit in question is that of Frances Me-
Cry*tle vs. Charles McCrystle on the
grounds of extreme cruelty and intem
perance. Mrs. McCrystle formerly
lived in San Francisco and a year ago
secured the services of Frank Burke
in that city and requested him to bring
suit for divorce for her. Since that
time she has frequently paid Burke
surr.5 of money, and he has led her to
believe that he had begun the case and
wak prosecuting it for her In the regu
lar manner.

The wedding of Miss Grace Pinney,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. D. Pinney
of First avenue, to Arthur V.". John
son will occur to-day at the attractive
home of the bride.
A wedding that will interest Cali
fornians, and San Rafaelites in Â¦ par
ticular, is that of charming "Winifred
Hester Macintosh and Robert Hewitt
Menzies, which occurred on July 7
at the summer home of the bride in
the Adirondacks. Hope was entertain
ed for some time by San Francisco
friends of both bride and groom thai
they might be given a chance to dance
at the wedding, but the fair bride de^
cided that her mountain home in the
East should be her nuptial hall.
Rev. John S. Macintosh, well re
membered by hosts of San Franciscans,
read the service that made the lovers
one. After the ceremony the happy
pair left for New York. It is thought
that the bride, who holds in her heart
a love for the home of her childhood,
will wander westward on her nuptial
journey. Where, indeed, could bÂ»
found a fairer bower for honeymoon
ing than the rose-covered home of the
bonny bride over in SÂ»n Rafael?

On Saturday Vallejo will be gay in
honor of the day. Admiral and Mrs.
McCalla yill entertain " a party of
friends at luncheon at their hospitable
home, and many of the officers' wives
will likewise entertain.
At no time were the naval set gayer
than now, each week bringing its quota
of hops, card parties and skimmings
over the blue.
For the maintenance of the home a
nominal sum will be charged for the
club's privileges with the view to mak
ing it partially self-supporting and
also that the sailormen be not pauper
ized by an institution that seeks to
elevate them.
It will be remembered that Admiral
McCalla laid the foundation for the
fund when he magnanimously contrib
uted his prize money won during the
Spanish-American war. To this sum
various individuals, clubs anti other or
ganizations gave various amounts,
thereby making the clubhouse for the
sailor laddies a possibility.
As the club stands to-day, the dom
inant figure of the countryside, it is
a fit gift to the sailormen. Its four
stories embrace sleeping apartments
for the men, well-equipped bathrooms,
a theater, a large dining hall, a j bil
liard-room, a library, a gymnasium
and all the accessories that go to make
an up-to-date clubhouse.
Out with your pretty frocks, maid^
and matrons â those of you who are
bidden to Vallejo on Saturday after
noon, when the Naval Club house, be
loved by all femininity, will be dedi
cated with a jubilation befitting the
triumph of its creation.
Admiral and Mrs. McCalla, projectors
of the clubhouse, will be toasted loud
and long on the day of the dedication,
not only by the "jackies," but by the
men and women who have lent a hand
â and many have lent both â to bring
the affair to successful .completion.

retain tbe love and admiration
of her husband should be a
woman's constant study. If
she would be all that she may,
she must guard well against the
signs of ill health. Mrs. Brown
tells her story for the benefit of
all wives and mothers.
" Dear Mrs. Pixkham : â Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
will make every mother well, strong,
healthy and happy. I dragged through
nine years of miserable existence, worn
out with pain and weariness. I then
noticed a statement of a woman
troubled as I was; and the wonderful
results she had had from your Vege-
table Compound, and decided to 'try
what it would do for me, and used ii for
three months. - At the end of that
time, I was a different woman, the
neighbors remarked it, and my hus-
band fell in love with me all over
again. It seemed like a new existence.
I had been suffering with inflamma-
tion and falling of the womb, but your
medicine cured that, and built up my
entire system, till I was indeed like a
new woman. â Sincerely ycurs, Mbs.

To be a successful wife, to IJames B. Clifton, a Folsom convict,
appeared before the Supreme Court
yesterday on a writ of habeas corpus
in a proceeding to test the validity of
the practice of the prison officials in
computing the length of sentences.
The arguments of, both sides were
heard and the case was ordered sub-
TOitted on briefs. While a decision is
pending Clifton will remain at-'Fol
som:
The prisoner was sentenced to two
terms of five years each for burglaries
committed in Los Angeles about seven
years ago. The law provides that the
credits on a five-year term shall
amount to one year and five months.
On a ten-year term the credits amount
to three years and six months.
If . the prisoner's two sentences are
to be considered as one term he will
gain eight months in credits". The
question has never been decided and
many convicts will be affected by the
result of the proceeding.
Official Method of Computing, Credits
at State's Prisons Is Called Into
Question.

YOSEMITE, July 11.â Camp. Curry
became excited last night by the mys
terious disappearance of T. L. Brown
and his son of San Francisco., They
started at 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing without a guide to make a trip to
North Dome, about seven miles from
the camp and, not returning by* even
ing, a searching party headed by Mr.
Curry started out to find them. Search
was kept up all night with lanterns,
but without success. The party re
turned to camp early, this morning. The
lost ones strolled into_ camp at 10
o'clock this morning.
Brown , says he lost his way after
reaching the summit of North Dome
and was compelled to stay on top all
night without covering and the tem
perature down to almost freezings Twb

begin with Geary street by changing
it into a beautiful boulevard stretch

Geary street has been given the

lessen the element of luck and permit
of an owner competing In several races
regardless of the time made by his>
yacht.
The club members will meet next
Wednesday night to discuss the ques
tion, and the most Interesting meeting
in the history of the club will result.
Collier will offer an amendment to hia
rules that will undoubtedly Improve
them. Under the amendment any boat
failing to come first or second after
participating in three trial races will be
dropped from the competition.
The cud race held last Sunday wa3
the most successful since the organiza
tion of the club. No records were
broken, but competition was keen, and
in the final race the boats were only a
few seconds apart. On Monday the
Piute won everything in sight. She won
the final and both trial races and made
the best time for the day.
A comparison of last year's boats and
those built this year shows that the old
ones are fully as speedy as the new.
Of the latter the Santee, owned by
Tood & Adams, and the Fannie, owned
by the Collier brothers, have been the
most successful. The Fannie has shown
considerable speed, but has been out of
luck. The Santee has already won sev
eral races.
Under- the official racing roles only
boats that finish first and second In a
trial race qualify for the final race.
Many complain that this Is an Injus
tice. They contend that It Is too far to
go and carry a boat to be beaten In the
first race and put out of the competi
tion in less than five minutes, ThlÂ»
"freeze-out" system certainly works s>
hardship on the owners of lnferloi
boats or boats out of luck, of which
there is a considerable element. Then

where boats frequently are becalmed
If the owner of a model Is unfortunate
enough to meet with this mishap he &

Collier's racing rules will do nYStch
more to encourage the sport than the
old rules. His idea is to average thÂ»
time of the models and the one with
the best average time for the day ii

are anxious If possible to Improve
them. To that end William Collier'*
new system has been tried and In the
main has been successful. Some of, thÂ»
sailors of the small craft are opposed to
it, but a majority think It Is an Im
provement on the old system.
In the afternoon he boxed four
rounds each with Danny Danziger and
Frank Newhouse. Bag punching and
shadow boxing completed his work for
the day. Nelson looks big and strong
and says he could go into the ring at
a few days* notice. He likes the cli
mate here and finds it much easier to
reduce than he did at the ocean beach.
He will have no trouble making the
weight and, barring accidents, will en

"The weight that I am to meet Nel
son is 130 pounds at six o'clock and
I am conceding some avoirdupois to
him, as I lost weight while in the East
ern States and will have to build up
to make the weight allowed in the ar
ticles. I will begin my work with short
runs on the road and easy boxing. I
am in fair trim now and feel that I
will experience no difficulty in getting
into first-class condition for my next
battle."
Eddie Hanlon went into camp at
Croll's Gardens, Alameda, yesterday to
prepare himself for his fight with Bat
tling Nelson that is billed to take place
on Friday evening, July 29. Eddie has
fitted himself for his most important
contests at Croll's Gardens and it was
like reaching home when he arrived
there yesterday.
With Hanlon are his boyhood friend,
Toby Irwin, who will meet Jack Cor
dell in one of the preliminaries to the
Hanlon-Nelson bout, Fred Landers
and Frank McDonald. The veteran
trainer, Billy Delany, is expected to be
a frequent visitor at Eddie's training
quarters and will be behind the little
fellow when he puts up his mitts in
front of the conqueror of Martin Can
ole. In speaking of his training plans
Hanlon said:
McClellan withdrew his objeotion to
the granting of the permit to the Yo
eemlte Club In view of an affidavit
filed by Harry Corbett that the club
has a gymnasium at 5 Larkin street
and a membership of 320. Boxton ob
jected to granting the permit, claim
ing the club had fixed up a gymnasium
within the hour and that it did not
comply with the ordinance. Boxton
ridiculed the gymnasium ' in serious
\-eln, which made his colleagues laugh
audibly. EggerB. the third member of
the committee, made a strong plea for
the Yosemlte Club.
The resolution received ten votes in
favor and six against.
The San Francisco Athletic Club was
granted a. permit for an amateur box-
Ing exhibition on July 22.
When It vas tipped along thÂ« line
that Coffroth landed the plum the wise
contingent looked wiser still, for the
majority of the sports were of the
opinion that the Tosemite Club would
eventually win out. So Jim Jeffries
and Jack Munroe will battle for' the
world's championship under the aus
pices of that organization after all.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
granted to the Tosemite Club the Au
gust permit for a professional boxing
exhibition. The majority of tha Police
Committee, consisting of Boxton and
2IcClelian, had recommended that the
permit be sivea to the Hayes Valley
Club, which also has the July priv
ilege.
Jimmy Britt and Eddie Hanlon may
meet to settle their long-standing
grudge in this city ere many moons
have waned. The Hayes Valley Club
is hot after a match between the two
native sons and even now a represen
tative of that organization is on his
way to Los Angeles to undertake the
task of talking the conqueror of Cor
bett Into mixing it with Hanlon.
When' Eddie made a proposition a
short time ago for a matoh with Britt
many seemed to think the matter a
joke. But the promoters of the Hayes
Valley Club evidently imagined that
there was a chance. Manager Morris
Levy and his able assistant, Billy
Roche, have not said a great deal, but
they must have been thinking some,
otherwise they would not have gone
to the expen.se of sending a man all
the way to Los Angeles to bring the
boys together.
George L. North, well known in
sporting circles, has been deputized to
try and coax Britt into a match with
Hanlon. He left for the south last
night with instructions to sign the
men at all costs for a twenty-round
go in this city in September. It is well
known that Hanlon is just aching for
a chance to try and wrest Britt's
laurels from him, but the latter may
not be willing to accommodate him.
North has been instructed to sign
the men for 60 per cent of the receipts
and Britt is to receive a 5 per cent
bonus for signing up. The question of
the referee will be settled later and a
side bet may be made should the boys
agree to do battle. The boys will be
asked to make 130 pounds at 6 o'clock.
Manager Levy did not have a whole
lot to say about the proposed scrap
and triedto pass it all off. Billy Roche
would have it appear that he is also
skeptical, but nevertheless they enter
tain fond hopes away down deep in
their hearts. Britt has theatrical en
gagements in August, but he may pos
sibly sidestep the Jrin if he sees more
money in sight by fighting Hanlon.

An early pacemaker was Thirty
third, owned, by Captain S. S. Brown,
and for three furlongs it was a prob
lem as to whether she would "come
back." Tradition was within reason
able distance and when they reached
the home stretch she began to mow
down the leader. As resistless as the
walking beam cf a great steamer was
Tradition's fine stride and she won by
three lengths, while Chrysitis, hemmed
in at the turn, did not escape the pock
et in time to catch Thirty-third. In
trigue, who lost ground in the early

Swollen glands, tumors, white swelling, sores, pustular
or scaly skin eruptions, flabby muscles, brittle bones, weak
digestion, emaciated, illy-nourished bodies, are some of
the well-known earmarks of Scrofula. Scrofula is inher-
ited. Parents too closely related by the ties of blood, or
tainted with consumption or blood poison, may look for
signs of Scrofula in their children. â¢The middle-aged often

A difference between a husband and
a wife as to the control of their prop
erty seems to be at the bottom of the
divorce case heard yesterday by Su
perior Judge* Graham and taken un
der advisement. \V. A. Samuel, a
butcher, sued his wife, Catherine, for
legal separation and she came back at
him in a cross-complaint. Her at
torney told the court that the hus
band wanted a divorce at all hazards,
but the wife did not because she was
*;too old." The couple were married
in 1SS0 and have four grown children.
Samuel charged his wife with run
ning bills without his consent and says
she received 545 a month rents from
property, but when he needed money
to pay off a mortgage she would not
let him have it and he was prevented
from going into business. For two
year?, he declares, she has not shared
their room with him. In her answer
and cross-complaint she not only de
nies all of his allegations, but says he
is too lazy to work and has no sepa
rate property. All of their possessions,
she says, were accumulated .with her
assistance and she avers that his suit
for divorce is to compel her to deed
her interest to him. She also says that
he has been guilty of cruelty and has
consorted with other women.

PROPERTY TROUBLE "BASIS
OF A SUIT FOR DIVORCE
John Isaacs, now secretary of the
Horticultural Commission, formerly
connected with the fruit pest quaran
tine office in this city, under Craw, is
reported to have said that he does not
wish to succeed his former "superior.
Among those who are more prominent
ly mentioned as having had experience
in the service are Edward N. Ehrhorn,
commissioner for Santa Clara County;
George P. Hall, formerly commissioner
for San Diego County; R. P. Cundiff,
commissioner for Riverside County; J.
W. Jeffrey, commissioner for Los An
geles County; W. H. Payne, inspector
at Monrovia; S. A. Pease of San Ber
nardino, and E. K. Carnes, who has
for a considerable period been acting
as Craw's deputj' in the quarantine
station In this city and consequently
in immediate touch with all the fruit
pest quarantine service. Of his effi
ciency Craw speaks highly.
An appointment to 'fill the position
at $200 a month may be made at any
time, but it Is supposed that no action
will be finally taken until Governor
Pardee returns from the East, as it is
customary to seek his approval in
making appointments of this import
ance.
There is a lively stir over the posi
tion that Alexander Craw, State fruit
pest quarantine officer, will relinquish
at the end of the present month. Craw
ls going to Hawaii to be the head of
the Hawaiian entomological service,
with a contract for five years at the
rate of $5000 per year. The position
that he vacates in this State, by resig
nation, is worth $200 a month. Sev
eral men connected with the Horti
cultural Commission staff of workers
haye applied already to Horticultural
Commissioner Ell wood Cooper, who has
the appointment of Mr. Craw's suc
cessor, to be installed In the retiring
quarantine officer's official shoes. No
indication has yet appeared upon the
surface concerning the probable ap
pointee.

Miss Edith Hyde, a pretty girl em
ployed in a Fourth street candy store,
accused Samuel Green, a barber, of
having sent to her an obscene picture,
and a little boy testified tlidt he. had
carried the offensive lithograph from
the defendant to the complainant at
the former'* request. Green denied hav
ing sent the picture to the girt, and
furthermore asserted It was not r ob
scene, inasmuch as it was freely circu
lated to advertise a patent medicine.
The picture was not produced In evi
dence, and the Judge instructed the
defendant to procure a duplicate and
have it in court to-morrow.
i eter Johnson of 1203 Folsom street
pad h:s 17-j-ear-old' daughter Helena
before Judge Conlan on the charge of
disturbing the peace, and testified that
the girl had called him "an old fool"
and in other ways provoked him to en
!ifit the law's aid in his enforcement of
his paternal authority. The girl told
the Judge that it was her father, and
not Ehe,.Tvho had disturbed the peace,
and that he was a domestic despot!
The case was continued till Wednes
day and the parties advised to inter the
hatchet. ;. ,v.. '--
Both the defendants admitted having
beg-ged. but denied having attempted
to blackmail. They were pronounced
pullty as charged, and the Judge de
femd sentence till to-day to give the
oncers time to obtain, if possible, tes
timony sufficient to warrant convic
tion on the more serious offense. Depot
said he worked by day and begged at
night and Ross confessed he had no
legitimate means of support.
Instructed by Judge Conlan and then
tl:e hearir.gr was set for next Tues
day, by which time the inquest on the
retr.alnis of Charles Hartman will be
completed. Geber was represented in
court m- ex-Judge Lowe.
â¢ * *
Two seventeen-year-old lads, regis
tered as Glen J. Ross and Edward De
pot, were operating a new phase of
the old blackmailing game when Po
licemen Hvde and Cornelius nipped
their enterprise and made them de
fendants in Police Judge Mogan's
court on the charge of begging. The
accusation would have been more se
rious if certain persons from whom the
boys attempted, to extort money had
not sidestepped the notoriety to be at
tair.ed by appearing to testify against
them.
It was in Jefferson Square Park,
favorite testing place of lovers, that
the bold and cunning youths plied their
illegal vocation. When they saw among
the t-pooners on the benches a man or
a woman who tried to avoid recogni
tion by passersby they made up their
minds that there was possibility of
obtaining hush money from that man
or woman. So they shadowed their in
tended victims ,until they discovered
where he or she lived, and if inquiries
proved their suspicion correct they
made their demand. Just how much
coin the young duo extorted in this
way the officers could not state. They
did know of one personâ a married
womanâ who was threatened with ex
rosure to her husband if she did not
pay JiO. It so happened that her meet
ing to discuss a business matter with
another man in the park was known
to her soouse and with his consent, so
she defied the blackmailers and in
formed the DoMce. But she would not
appear to prosecute, so the officers had
to wait until they caught the lads in
the act of soliciting alms.
August C-eber, who tried to kill the
Hartman family Sunday morning, was
who followed and captured Goldman
after the shooting, paid that after Gold
man fired the shots he went out the
door of the hotel office and closed it
b->hird him. but reopened it and threw
the pistol inside. W. J. Wiley, secre
tary of the San Francisco Brewing
Company, and Frank Paillet, manager
tif the Clarendon, also testified, but
toW nothing new. The case was then
continued till 11 o'clock this morning,
when. Mr. Murphy announced, the com.
2-Iaining witness will be subjected to a
starching cross-examination by him.
Dr. Francis F. Knorg testified that
he treated Snow'* wounds, and consid
ered it safer to let two of the bullets
remain unextrarted. Night Clerk Ed
v.ard Rose, of the Clarendon Hotel.
Adolph Goldman. Â« .-barged with at
tempting to murder ex-Mayor Roland
W. Snow or Oakland, showed more
â¢ oir.posure yesterday than was expect
fd when he appeared for preliminary
examination In Judge Slogan's court,
lie sat Quietly beside his attorney,
Frank Murphy, and calmly listened
to the testimony of several witnesses,
none cf whom threw any new light on
the shooting or the causes that led to
it. Snow looked rather sallow, and fre
quently prompted Prosecuting Attorney
<5re*>iey. He seldom glanced at the
man who shot him, and not once did
Goldman look at hfm.
A badly scared colored man was Ar
thur WnU*nis just after his release
from a murder charge in Police Judge
Fritzs court, and his fright did not
te^an until he was Fa'ely locked In
hÂ« City -'rison.
Willinras and James H. Smith were
jointly feookel for the" murder of An
thony Owen Gallagher, a hackman.
They were non-unicn stablemen, and
the preliminary examination attracted
the crowd that always fills a police
court while a case involving the labor
question is on hearing. After hearing
the testimony the Judge discharged
Williams and h^ld Smith to answer in
i he Superior Court, and the crowd we nt
<>ut and loitered In the corridor. As
Williams walked out, accompanied by
Defective Flyan, the throng began to
close In on him, with angry mutter- '..
:rÂ»gs. and he shrank close to the of.icer
until he cntorcd the elevator, whfre he I
quickly sought the corner farthest from j
the door and stood there trembling un- |
'. il he was landed on the prison floor, j
Thore he remained until the crowd de-
I arted, when he was rushf-d to the
basemrnt and aided to escape unob
rerved.
Smith displayed less concern for his
late. He laughed when the Judge held
him to the higher court, and he fairly
k< -reamed with merriment when told of
the funk in which his late fellow de
fendant was.
John E. Anderson, a clerk, attempted
to rescue a soldier whom a policeman
was arresting Saturday evening on the
Rarbary Coast, and Judge Mogan will
hear the case next Thursday.
Frank Ohata, a Japanese teamster,
was fined $5 for trespassing: on private
property. He drove his horse and wagon
over the Southern Pacific track at Ber
nal cut and narrowly escaped demoli
tion by a freight train.
"Better make the swear-off extend
over Mrs. Raymond's next birthday,"
said the Judge as he signed an order of
dismissal.
M. J. Raymond celebrated his wife's
birthday by purchasing a keg of beer
and inviting: a few friends to partake
of It at his residence, at the corner of
Devisadero and Haight streets, and
when he appeared before Judge Conlan
yesterday on a charge of peace dis
turbance his face was badly scratched.
Ke didn't know who Inflicted the inju
riesâindeed, before the keg was half
emptied he knew nothingâ and he
would immediately swear off for a year
if he were allowed to go free.
an adult, and I will slap the face of
any person who applies it to me."
Such was the declaration of intention
uttered by Gertrude Williams, accused
of disturbing the peace at 911^2 Mission
street. She slapped the face of an un
known man who had familiarly said to
her. "Hello, kid," and she slapped the
face, of Patrolman Murphy when that
vigilant officer undertook to interview
her. Judge Mogran continued the case
till to-morrow.

He is no imitator. His work is upon original
lines: Pure thought/clear vision. He tells
you what you desire to know and works In the
open light. f
Â¦ He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he Is for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness.
.A test reading Is not a life reading: when
you call on Prof. Livingstone he will give you
a full life reading for $!; a test Is of little
value; when the mind is troubled you need
more substantial aid and advice; this is Just
what Prof. Livingstone gives you when you call
on him for a first-class clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know,- ..._Â¦
Would It not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters
that are troubling you, and of the schemes of
yuor enemies, that you may meet with bettjjr
success? w
He does not mention ail the Ills and misfor-
tunes you are heir to; you are acquainted with
the facts in your case; let Prof. Livingstone
analyze the/ matters â¢ that are troubling you.
fln.i the cause of the trouble and suggest the
remedy.
His only reason for giving your name in full
or any Important Information you may desire
is that he does thU incidentally as a chain to

The steamer H. J. Corcoran, the San Fran
cisco-Vallejo flyer, has won the heart of the
harbor police by the way in which her Sunday
excursions are conducted. Sunday excursions
In the. past have been too often little more
than disorderly gambling fests. from which the
Innocent excursionist has returned properly
plucked of his financial wool. Piper, Aden &
Goodall Company, owners of the Corcoran, de
cided when they started Sunday excursions to
Inaugurate a censorship of their passenger lists
for the purpose of eliminating the sure-thing
element. Captain Burnett of the harbor police,
who keeps a sharp watch on everything in the
excursion line, points to~the Corcoran excur
sions as modeln and says that if all Sunday
excursions could be measured by tho Corcoran
standard the police would lose interest In these
affairs and the public could feel safe In taking
their holiday recreation on the water. The
Corcoran last Sunday took a large crowd to
Ant loch and other points of Interest.

much heavy weather on the voyage, but got
the worst of It a few days after starting. So
stormy did the weather become that February

a sheltered cove off Cuxhaven. In spite of the
shelter, hich seas swept her decks and four
days later, when she resumed her voyage, dam
cged deckhouses and smashed in boats provided
repair v/orlc sufficient to keep all hands busy
for a long time. Heavy gales were encoun
tered for nine days off Cape Horn. She brought
a large cargo of general merchandise.

HKAIi ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
BELL SPRINGS. July 11. â At 4: SO
this afternoon the members of the
California Promotion Committee's ex
cursion, bound for Eureka, passed
from Mendocino County into the land
of Humboldt. The party to-day spent
two hours at Bell Springs for dinner,
when they struck off over the old State
road. They will arrive at Harris to
night about 6 o'clock, in advance of
their schedule time, as they have been
provided with four and six horsa
stages by A. P. Cross.
All were in good spirits and declared
it one of the most unique experiences
of their lives. From the time they left
Sherwood yesterday morning until
their arrival at Bell Springs at 1
o'clock to-day the business men de
clared their surprise at the fertility oÂ£
the section through which they passed.
They had expected to see only lonely
stretches of forest. Instead they were
greeted at intervals by fertile mountain
valleys scantily inhabited, but capabla
of supporting a great population.
Long Valley In particular charmed
the visitors. They saw plenty of good
land which could be had from $7 50 to
$30 an acre. This valley demonstrates
that almost, anything can be raised in
this part of Mendocino County, and as
fine apples as can be had anywhere in
this State are produced in Long Val
ley.
The party will arrive at Eureka to
morrow night, being taken by special
train from Camp Five. At every point
so far in the itinerary camps with
comfortable quarters have been proJ
vided for the visitors. Most all tha
travelers are clad In khaki suits and
many of them are wearing Panama
hats, giving quite a unique appearance
to the body.

- Butter, Cheese and Eggs. â¢?Â¦!;
Receipts jot Butter continue excessive, as
will be seen, but the market shows no decline
yet. though it Is top-heavy and almost all !
houses are willing to shade the quotations to
sell.-. Some are giving their salesmen Instruc
tions to sell anyhow to get rid of the goods.
Some excellent Eastern cube Butter Is coming
in. and, as already mentioned, is cut up Into
squares and goes readily into consumption as
first-class - California creamery. This, of
course, takes just eo much demand away from 1
the California article. This Eastern Butter :
can be landed here at 19V^c,j which makes lt â¢
a formidable competitor with the home product, i

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Trade In deciduous. fruits for local use and
nearby shipment was quite brisk, but with re
ceipts of most descriptions excessive and the
canners practically out of the market, an easy
feeling prevailed and as usual, there was a
heavy , surplus unsold at the close. Peaches
were, still very weak, there being over IC.OOO
boxes on the market. Small packages of the
Hale's Â¦ Early . variety- were selling at 25Â© 10
and the ruling price for the yellow varieties
was 50c , per box. Figs of good quality were '
rather;- scarce and firmer, but there was an
abundance of poor, leaklnjr stock, which had
been several days In transit and could not be
sold at any price. . Loose Apricots were In light
receipt, but weak, as the canners were over
loaded with contract stock and were purchas
ing, but llttlo In the open market. ' Shipments
from the river district* have about ceased and I
the crops from other sections have not yet com- !
menced to come forward very freely. Cherries
In umall packajrea were offering at 65cfi$l and
loose Â¦Â¦ etock from Oregon sold at 5*J8c per
pound.- A' car, load of White Nectarines came ';
in from Fresno and they were offered at 50if?GUc

was too Â¦- green to attract â¢ trade. Cantaluopes
sold at a wider. range as. to. size of ' package,

> NEW YORK, July 11.â Dy the time the
Ftock market was concluded to-day the mar
ket showed the effect of the very Urge realiz
ing sales that had been going on during the
j early and active periods of trading. Prices
I opened higher and the first hour's trading was
vfry laige and fluctuations very narrow. Mon-
I day morning is a favorable opportunity for
profit taking by practiced speculators, owing
to the effect produced on a new set of buyers
of f-tocks by the opening of a new week after
a period or rising prices. The weekly sum
ming up of conditions In the business and In
; dustria! world is likely to bring into brokers
offices an accumulation of orders; of which ad
vantage is habitually taken, even in the mid.st
of a prolonged upward movement of prices.
The steady pressure upon this morning's mar
ket was not unexpected, therefore, and was
not disquieting to sentiment over the general
outlock The manner In which the. market
absorbed the profit taking and the small flue
j tuations caused by it gave evidence of the
: volume of the new demand and gave promise
I or a favorable basis for a new advance when
, the professional operators had tested the mar
1 net and realized their profits in canh Thus
I insurance was felt over the action of the later
markn when attempts were made to renew
e a J S \? nce by bldd| ns UP of special stocka.
me dullness and heaviness of the speculation
was naturally relieved by theÂ« efforts. The

; served as a partial offset to the expectation* of

Yesterday morning Jacob Eppinger,
accompanied by his eons, Joe and Mor
ris, appeared in court apparently much
the worse for wear. Instead- of occupy
ing his usual seat behind his attorneys
he took a place near a window which
could be opened for air in case of a
serious collapse. After the roll call of
the jurors. Attorney Ach stepped up
to Judge Lawlor's desk and informed
the court that the defendant "was very
Another delay occurred in the Ep
pinger trial yesterday, owing to the ill
ness of the defendant. The prosecu
tion is Inclined to the opinion that this
illness is only feigned, as the attacks
come at most "convenient periods for
the defense. From time to, time dur
ing the trial the attorneys for Ep
pinger have been protesting against
the long hours in the courtroom, argu
ing that they had not sufficient -time
to read over the transcripts and pre
pare their case. Meanwhile the prose
cution was busily engaged in forging
link after link in the chain of evidence
with which it experts to convict the
bead of 'the once prosperous grain firm.
Last week, when the note, book of
the firm was introduced Jn court, a
new line of inquiry was opened, which,
it was thought, might occupy several
days, but, much to the surprise of all.

ill and suggested that an adjournment
be taken. Judge Lawior in reply said
that he was averse to a further, con
tinuance and would like the opinion of
Dr. Gallwey as to tha physical condi
tion of the defendant. The jury was
excused and a message sent, to Dr.
Gallwey, but he was attending a pa
tient in San Mateo and could not re
spond. As It was represented that Ep
pinger was in a serious condition.
Judge Lawior advised that his . own
physician be summoned, making the
proviso that no extended continuance
of the case would be granted until a,
doctor summoned by the court had
given an opinion.
Dr. L. D. Whitney. Eppinger's physi
cian, was called in and after a brief
examination said the patient was suf
fering from a spasm of the heart which
might at any time prove fatal and it
was dangerous to keep him longer in
the close air and under the nerve-try-,
ing conditions of the courtroom. An
adjournment was accordingly allovCed
until 10 o'clock this morning and the
aged defendant, supported by his two
sons, left the courtroom.
Eppinger's attorneys declare that he
is very feeble but that in their anxiety
to finish the trial he stayed up with
piem until midnight on Sunday aiding
them in preparing the defense. This,
they believe, partially accounts for the
collapse of yesterday. |

The row commenced on a car from
the Cliff House, and at Haight and
Stanyan streets there was a general
mix-up, and it is claimed that Henry
Issendorf struck Cusick. According to
Sexton's statement that was the rea
son Cusick and his friends made the
attack upon the Issendorfs at Page and
Lyon streets. ~ -
Percy Sexton, clerk in the Southern
Pacific Company's storekeepingr depart
ment, who was shot by Fred Issendorf
at Page and Lyon streets early yester
day morning:, is in a critical condition
at the Southern Pacific Hospital. As
sistant District Attorney Louis Ferrari
was sent to the hospital yesterday to
take his ante-mortem statement, but he
said he thought he would pull through.
He made a statement in the presence
of Issendorf and witnesses signed It.
The statement is as follows:
I think Fred Issendorf did thÂ» shootlnr- X
am not sure. About 1:30 this morning; down
at thÂ» corner of Lyon and Page, streets, about
twenty-five feet up Lyon. Judas Delcaaao,
James and Harold, his brothers. Frank Cuslclc
and William Harvey went down with thÂ« In
tention of setting- those fellows. I did not
want to go, but they finally sot me to go. I
don't know who the fellows were. W* walked
down and rot off a car and got la a doorway.
Then we all walked up and wÂ» saw Fred von
Issendorf with a gun. I walked up the hill
fifteen or twenty feet and stood there. They
then began to tell him to put In the iroa and
throw rocks, and one of the rocks hit him In
the Jaw. He began to shoot and I got bit. X
could not tell how many shots were firedâ
four. I believe. I did not participate In
anything at all. I don't think he knew where
he was shooting: himself. One of those fellows
bad hit one of our boys and we were coins
down to make things even.
Issendorf claimed that he shot In self
defense, as he and his brother Henry
were being pelted with rocks and pieces
of wood. One of the rocks struck him
on the jaw, knocking him down, and
when he appeared in Police Judge Slo
gan's court his face showed the effects
of the blow. He was charged with as
sault to murder and the case was con
tinued till next Monday. His brother
Henry was struck on the mouth with
a piece of scantling and his lips are
cut and swollen. The brothers have a
grocery at Page and Lyon streets.
Detectives O'Dea and Mulcahy and
Policemen McTevitt and Kerrison, who
are working on the case, arrested
James and Harry Delcasso, Frank
Cusick, William Harvey and Eddie Me
Elroy. With the exception of McElroy
they are being detained as witnesses.
McElroy was a friend of the Issendorfs
and was also a target for the rocks and
pieces of Â¦ wood, but was not hit. He
was released from custody.
.The board adjourned to meet this
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock as a Board of

Brandenstein, "and whenever we. find

LAW TO BE ENFORCED.
J. P. Martin, agent of the Sharon es
tate, had been summoned to explain
why no safety device had been attached
to tlie sidewalk elevator at 607 Market
street, where a man had been seriously
injured. Martin said he had received
notice to install the device on June 2,
and the accident had occurred while
he was preparing to comply with the
ordinance." He, had let a contract to
some iron works for the attachments.
While the Supervisors' Finance Com
mittee was investigating yesterday the
complaint of J. G. Smythe that the or
dinance requiring safety devices on
sidewalk elevators was not being com
plied with, R. G. Garter, a plumber,
employed by the Sharon estate, de
clared that he visited the office of the
Board of Works to secure a copy of the
ordinance and that some one whom he
thought was employed Jjy the city
handed him a circular telling of the
merits of a device made by the Griffith
machine shop. Chairman Brandenstein
of the committee thought the charge a
serious one, and directed the sergeant
at-arms to. locate the employe' with
Gaiter's aid. Garter, however, was un
able to identify any of the employes in
the office of the Board of-Works as the
one who had recommended the device,
and so informed the committee. Should
the one. accused be discovered it will
go hard with him.
In the meantime William Hfcgan, as
a member of the firm recognized by
the city as the official undertakers, Is
gathering the city's dead and preparing
the bodies for burial. The barn back
of S620 Nineteenth street is the firm's
headquarters.
Â¦ I think the law Is plain enough and Rood
enough to handle this matter and I certainly
would not consent to the use of force to pre
vent my own brother frarcn burying the dead,
elthoush I have told him not to use our ground
for that purpose again. If it should come to a
point where the law could not prevent it I
would Just let the matter go. but I think the
proper may to Â«lo will be to ret an Injunction.
The matter will be talked over In the morning
and we will then decide what to do.
Joseph Hagan says he does not want
any notoriety over the dispute which
has arisen between himself and broth
er, but substantiates all James Hagau
says about the offer to buy out his

James Hagan Is waiting to learn
â¢what his lawyer has to say regarding
the opposition firm's use of land be
longing to himself and his brother
Joseph. He called at the Health Office
yesterday and protested that no per
mits should be issued- to the new firm
on the ground that they had no land
in which to inter the dead. Deputy
Health Officer Levy said he would Is
sue the permits, as the Supervisors
had awarded the contract to Kelley &
Hagan, and they claimed they had a
place of burial. No other complaints
have been received by the Board cf
Health, hence Levy concluded- that
the trouble was a family one and that
he would keep aloof from such a row.
When asked as to the real cause of
the complaint James Ha?an said:
WILL USE FORCE.
Xo complaints have been made by the neigh
bore regarding the holding of bodies here, as
I have not held any aonger than the law
allcws. Until the permit is granted for us
to use the land we bought and have platted
Â»â¢<* win bury in the lots adjoining.
We paid ioOO for the lots we have asked
the San Alateo Supervisors to allow us to
use as a burial ground and have had the
ground surveyed and the title examined. That
and the other expenses which we have had
amounts to an investment of $1000. Yes. part
of that was paid as attorney fees to pet the
pwrr.it through the San Mateo Supervisor*
end part of it for general expenses. The per
mit should come from the Supervisors within
the next nine days and then we can bury in
the lots we have bought.
My two brothers are anxious to keep this
matter before the public through the news
p?r*rs so as to prejudice the minds of the
Board of Supervisors of San Mateo County
*nd . ausf- me to fail in getting the permit
to bury the pauper dead In the ground which
I have purchased and have platted as Sunny
vale Cemetery. The facts of the case are that
tar two brother* and David Kelley fixed up
a scheme to put in only one bid to the
Supervisors for the burial of the poor of San
Krancisco and then divide the work. The
price tras to have been S1O for each corpse,
aÂ»Ju:t or child, but we learned of the scheme
and put in our bid for (5 50. which is enough.
VV f have gone to considerable expense in
fitting up a place for the care of bodies and
burial ol San Francisco's poor and 1 intend
to continue my contract wiifc the city. John
Kelley has put up the money with the un
derstanding that I buy him out when I can.
Atvtr we g^ot the contract from the city my
brothers si-nt their lawyer to Kelley and of-
Itred him $50u to turn the contract over to,
them. He refused to do eo and now they
are tryÂ«rtÂ«r to set us turned down in San
ilateo County.
William Iiagan was busy yesterday
preparing boxes to receive the dead
bodies of the city's poor. He stopped
long enough in his work to say:
There is still trouble between thÂ»
Hagans, but William has not been ar
rested for placing the pauper dead in
the lots belonging to his brothers,
James and Joseph, in San Mateo Coun
ty. William says his two brothers are
trying to have his contract rescinded
by the Board of Supervisors of San
Francisco because they want the con
tract themselves. The two brothers,
James and Joseph, deny that they
vant to bury the indigent dead of San
Francisco ct 55 50 per corpse, but they
do insist that their brother William
and his partner, Kelley, shall not de
posit the paupers' bodies in their
ground.
On Sunday nisht James Hagan said
he would have his brother William and
William's partner, Kelley, arrested the
first thing Monday morning, but he
faiJed to make good his threat. He
gives as a reason that the lawyer with
v.hom he was to consult did 'not come
to seÂ«Â» him at the time agreed upon.
This morning at 9 o'clock the matter
is to be taken up and the opinion of
the lawyer expressed as to the rights
in the case.
White Whlttlesey, assisted by the
Alcazar stock company, gave last night
a highly creditable production of
"Hearstease." Whittlesey's Interpre
tation of the role of Eric Temple was
both Intelligent and painstaking and
in his conscientious work throughout
the performance he showed himself the
clever actor that he is. He read his
lines with consummate skill and rose
to the occasion in the impassioned
scenes with which the play abounds.
John B. Maher was well cast as Cap
tain Jack O'Hara and contributed to
the comedy of the play with his
usual ability. The return of Miss Oza
Waldrop in the part of Alice Temple
was the signal for much applause,
showing the appreciation in which the
little actress is held. Nor was that
appreciation misplaced, for she played
with a rare grace that is all her own.
Harry D. Byers was eminently satis
factory as Lord Neville, who Is a king
pin of irascibility, although he amiably
helps to set things right in the last act.
Miss Marie Rawson was not happy in
the character of Miss Neville, albeit
she may improve. Adele Belgard was
admirable as Lady Neville and Luke
Conness was himself as Sir Geoffrey.
Howard Scott gave a delightful Imper
sonation of Peter Padbury and again
demonstrated . his versatile talent in
acting well any part that is assigned to
him. Richard Vivian and Marie Howe
were all that could be. desired in small
parts. Curtain calls were frequent and
Whittlesey's charming little speech
was not the least entertaining part of
the production.

Mr. Davis owes much to his inter
preters. It is not easy to imagine him
more deeply in debt to any cast than
the one Mr. Frohman has given to the
play. It is almost Ibsenish in size, by
the way. Miss Barrymore and a half
dozen others sufficing for the present
ment. As charmingly individual as
Maude Adams is the delightful young
woman that heads the cast. She is as
natural, as archly spontaneous, as
quickly humorous, as Maude Adams
herself, and, like all of the Drew fam
ily, John Drew's niece has "manner"â
tons of it. She is beautiful again, in a
lean, willowy, ultra-fashionable fash-
Ion, and is voiced deliciously. But* that
she hardly looks the twenty-nine
years that Cousin Kate owns to, Miss
Barrymore's portrait is all its author
paints" it. In her rare girlishness she
however : fails to suggest sometimes
the experieriWd woman of the world
that is intended, but in the tenderness,
romance, lively humor of the character
Miss Barrymore is charmingly con
vincing. She is at all times a picture,
and her naive, gracefully awkward
bows at the curtain call a*re alone
worth going to see. Altogether, this,
youngest member of the Drew family is
found an admirably accomplished
actress and a young woman of an ex
quisite individual charm.
Miss Barrymore's support is of the
best. As the lover Bruce McCrea is
picturesquely and emotionally satisfy
ing. ' He has the impulsive accent that
makes his "chutlng" into love emi
nently plausible and a virile, romantic
note that fills in the rest of the char
acter with entire . conviction. His
brogue is most ingratiating. Cousin
Amy is made a dainty and priggish
little -perst-n, a. mouthpiece of other
people's opinions, with careful stupid-'
ity, by Beatrice Agnew. The concep
tion could not be bettered. Grant
Stewart as the' curate who takes charge
of. the family conscience is excellent
and Fanny Addisoh Pitt is drolly clever
as the" weak little motner of Amy.
There is a small son of somebody who
should not be forgotten," Augustin D.'
Wilks. "Gus" is all right. " He as
sumes the role of Amy's schoolboy
brother and you feel like throwing
himâ a bag of peanuts for itl" He's a
real,; truly Â»boy. ,
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
"Cousin Kate" is for the purposes of
amusement only. The author poses
no ' problem, . preaches no gospel.
Cousin Kate is a charming young
woman novelist who falls in love at
first sight with her cousin's fiance.
The attraction is mutual." She meets
the gentleman on the train that takes
her to her cousin's house for the wed
ding, and unaware of each â¢ other's
identity they recognize themselves as
twin souls. It is very sudden, but Mr.
Davies makes the contingency suffi
ciently plausible for the purposes of
comedy, and is admirably assisted
therein by the. actors. f How Cousin
Amy, the young woman who is the
original owner of Cousin Kate's affin
ity, is provided for and the happiness
of all attained need not be related.
It is worth the price to find out. Very
wittily, lightly, Mr. Davies has handled
his dialogue, and his situations are
"charmingly unhackneyed. Few pret
tier scenes will be remembered than
the one between Cousin Kate and her
would-be lover, where they take tea
together â still unconscious of each
other's identityâ and weave nursery
stories about the fire in the man's
home.
Out of the theatrical wrack and ruin
of last season in New York only a few
plays survived. "Cousin Kate," pre
sented last night at the Columbia for
the first time here, was one of them.
Small wonder! It. would be difficult to
imagine so severely disastrous season
as that in which this pretty trifle could
not float gayly to success. ; It is of com
edy the airiest, gay, fanciful and poetic,
running lightly through a charming
story to a too early ending. Again, it
is deliciously acted by Miss Ethel Bar
rymore and her associates, and San
Franciscoâ all "of its bluebook folk that
are at^iome, that isâ saw fit last night
to indorse New York's verdict. '
And I doubt if patriotism- had any-:
thing to do with the matterâ or re
morse. Both sentiments were very
properly in order. Hubert Henry Da
vies, author of the comedy, was one of
our local prophets that found no honor
in his N>wn country. Even New York
would have none of him â until London
persuaded. Now the erstwhile critic of
the News Letter is sending_his made
in-London comedies to his old stamp
ing ground and conquering with a
"Cousin Kate." and, like Oliver Twist,
one asks for more.
while George Webster, as a tramp
printer with a heap -of useful knowl
edge; Julia Blanc, as the proprietor of
a village boarding house, and Edna
Ellsmere, in a fine ingenue role, com
pleted an excellent cast. A crowded
house showed that it enjoyed the play.
