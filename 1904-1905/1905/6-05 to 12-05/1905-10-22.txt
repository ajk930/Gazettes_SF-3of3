THE MYSTERY
SILVER BLAZE
Thla Is taa eiffhth of a aeries
of ctorlea by A. Conan Uoyle,
iccUngr Trith the adventiire* of
the famous detective* Sherlock
Holme*, nf to the time of hi*
memorable strucslc for life
upon the Switserland moun
tain ytth with the redoubtable
MÂ«riÂ«rity. These are the orlc
tmal Sherlock Holmes Â«torleÂ«,
\u25a0ad the one* which made Dr.
Doyle's fame. They are entire
ly apart from the aeries which
recent!?- appeared In the Snn
4ar Call entitled "The Return
of Sherlock Holmes.** - \u25a0
<Copyrtrbt, 19C5, by Harper A Brother*).
a a T AM afraid. Watson, that I shall
* I have to go," said Holmes, as we
j sat down together to our break
fast ona morning.
"Go! Where to?"
"To Dartmoor; to King's Pyland."
I was not surprised. Indeed, my only
wonder was that he had not already been
mixed cp in this extraordinary case,
which was the one topic of conversation
through the length and breadth of Eng
land. For a whole day my companion
had rambled about the room, with his
chin upon his chest and his brows knit
ted, charging and recharging his pipe
with the f strongest black tobacco, and
absolutely deaf to any of my questions or
remarks. \ Fresh editions of every paper
had been sent up by our news agent, only
to be glanced over and tossed down into
a corner. Yet, silent as he \u25a0firasÂ«_l.knew
.. perfectly ..ireil -what it was over^whlcS-^e"
was brooding. There was but one prob
lem before the public which could chal
lenge his powers of analysis, and .that
was the singular disappearance of the fa
vorite for the Wessex <up and the tragic
murder of Its trainer. When, therefore,
he suddenly announced his Intention of ;
setting out for the scene of the drama it
was only what I had boia expected and
hoped for.
"I should be most happy to go down
with you if I should not be In the way,"
said I.
"My dear Watson, you would confer a
great favor upon me by coming. And I
think your time \u25a0will not be misspent, for
there are points about the case which
"promise to make it an absolutely unique
one. We have. I think, just time to catch
our train at Paddlngton, and I will go
further into the matter upon our journey.
You would oblige me by bringing with
you your very excellent field glass."
And so.it happened that an, hour or so
later I found myself In the corner of a
first-class carriage flying along en route
for .Exeter, while Sherlock Holmes, with
his eharp, eager face framed in his - ear-
Capped traveling cap, dipped rapidly into
tha bundle. of fresh papers which he had
procured at Paddington. . We had lett
Reading! far behind us before he thrust
the last on; of them under the seat and
offered ta* his cigar case.
"We are going well," said he,- looking
out of the window and glancing at his
â¢watch." "Our rate at present is fifty- three
and a half miles an hour."
"I ha\ r e not observed the quarter-mile
posts.** said I.
."Nor have I. But the telegraph posts
upon this line are 6ixty yards apart and
the calculation Is a simple one. I pre
sume that you have looked Into this
matter of John Straker and the dis
appearance of Silver Blaze?"
v "I have seen what the Telegraph and
the Chronicle have to say." .
"It Is one of those. cases where the
art of tho rcasoner should be . used
rather for the Fitting -, of details than
for the acquiring of fresh evidence.
The tragedy has been so uncommon, so
i complete and of such personal lmport
\u25a0* ance to so many- people that ye are
suffering from a \ plethora of surmise,
conjecture and hypothesis. The \u25a0 dif
ficulty is to detach the -framework of
fact, of absolute, undeniable fact, from
the embellishments- of thebrlsts-and re
porters. Then, having established our
selves upon, this Sound 1 basis, If is our;
duty to see what Inferences may -be
drawn and what are the special -points
upon which the frhole -mystery ! turns.
On Tuesday * evening â¢ I-* received tele
gTams from both' Colonfel-'Ros3, the
owner of the horse, and from Inspector
Gregory, who is looking after the' case, -
Inviting -'my cp-operationl" ;
"Tuesday . evening;"-' I ' exclaimed.*
"And this is Thursday morning. 1 Why*'
didn't you go down yesterday?" ?/
"Because 1 made a blunder, 1 my dear*
Watsonâ which is'l am afraid, a mqr'e
common occurrence than; a"iiy;one would *

believe it possiblp /that, "the most re

however, another tmornlng had come .
and I found; that "beyond the arrest of

puffing at my cigar, while Holmes,
leaning forward, with his long, thin
forefinger checking- off the points upon
tne palm of his left hand.* gave me a
sketch 01 the events which had led to
our Journey.
"Silver Blaze," said he, "Is from the
Eomomy stock, and holds as. brilliant a
record as his famous ancestor. He is now
in his fifth year, and has brought in turn
each of the prizes of the turf to Colonel
Ross,! bis-fortunate owner. Up to the
time of the catastrophe he tras the first
favorite for theWessex cup, the betting
being three to ' one on him. 'He has al
ways, however/- been a prime favorite
with the racing public, and has never yet
disappointed. them, so that, even at those
odds enormous sums of money have been
raid upon him. It is obvious/therefore,
that there were many people who had the
strongest interest in preventing Silver
Blaze from being there at tne fall of the
flag next Tuesday. * \u25a0 '
"The- fact was, of course, appreciated
at King's Pyland, where the colonel's
training stable Is situated." Every .pre
caution was taken to guard the favorite.,
The trainer,- John Straker, is a retired-,
jockey, who rode in Colonel .Ross' colors
before he became too hfeayy for the
weighing chair.' ; He has served the colo
nel for live years -as: Jockey, and for. 'sevens
as : trainer, and : has always show-n him- *
self to be a.zealous and honest servant/ !
Under^ him were three lads^fbr .the estab
llEhment wasa sraallone. containing only,
four horses In all. One of, these lads sat

about two 'hundred yards from' the rstk

country round Is â¢ very 1 but
about a half-mile to the north there is a
small" cluster cf villas which have been,
built by a Tavistock contractor .for* the"
useof Invalids, and'others" who'niay wish
to enjoy the pure Dartmoor 'air.'^Tavis

miles distant. Is the -larger training es
tablishment" Of Mapleton,* which i belongs
to Lord Blackwater, â¢ and '\u25a0\u25a0 is managed by
Silas Brown. /, In every pother direction
the moor is a complete wilderness, inhab
ited only by a few roaming gj'psles. Such
was the general situation ' last - Monday
night when the catastrophe occurred^
"On that evening the horses had \ been
exercised and watered as usual and the
stables were locked up at nine o'clock.
Two of the lads walked ;up to the. train
er's house, where they had' supper in the
kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter,.re
mained on guard. At a few minutes after
nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried
down to the stables" his supper, J. which
consisted of ' a dish of curried 1 mutton.
She took no licuid, as there was. a* water,
tap In the stables, and it was the rule
that the lad on duty should drink noth
ing else. The ; maid ' carried a â¢ lantern
with .her, as It was very dark and 'the
path ran across the open moor. \ %
"Edith Baxter was within thirty
yards of the stables, when, a man ap- '
peared out of the darkness and called
to her to stop. As he stepped Into the
circle of yellow light thrown by. the
lantern she saw that he. .was a ; persQnÂ»**

against * the favorite. On being ar
rested he volunteered the statement
that he had come down to Dartmoor In
the hope of getting some information
j about the j King's Pyland . horses, and
also about Desborough. the second fa
vorite,'.which \ was in charge of Silas
Brown at the "Maple ton -stable*. He
did not attempt to deny that, he had
acted as , described upon the evening
before, .but /declared that he had no
sinister designs, \u25a0 and had simply wish
ed ,to obtain^ first-hand ; Information.

which the trainer had succumbed. On

upon his person, while the state -of

at least 'of his assailants mu^t bear
his mark upon him. There you have it
all in a nutshell. Watson, and if you
j can give me any light I shall .be in
finitely obliged to you."
-\ I had listened with the greatest In
terest^ to the statement which Holmes,
with characteristic clearness, had laid
Before me. Though most of the facts
.were familiar to me I had not suffi
ciently appreciated their relative im
portance nor their connection to each
"other.
,~ "Is it not; possible," I suggested,
- "that the incised wound iupon . Straker
/may have been caused by his own
; knife ,in the convulsive struggles

It r was evening before we reached - the
little town of Tavistock, which lies, like
the boss of a shield, in the inWdle of the
huge circle of Dartmoor* Two^gentlemon
i were awaiting us in the ; stationâ (he cna
a tall, fair man with lion-Ilka hair acd
beard and curiously . penetrating light
.blue eyes; the "other a small, alert person,
'very neat and dapper. In a frock, coat and
gaiters, with .trim little aide
; and an eye-glass. 'The latter .was .Colonel
Ross, the ', well-known r \u25a0 sportsman ; the
other. Inspector Gregory, a man who wrj
rapidly ; making his cam*, in the English
detective service. . 'v ; /Â°;. ,
' "I am â¢ delighted that . you â¢ have /com*

"The Inspector - heYe has done - all that
could possibly be suggestea. but I wish
to leavÂ» no 3tonÂ« unturned In I trying to
avenge poor Straker and in recovering my
, horse." . . * '
J "Have there been any fresh devtlop

j "I am sorry to say that ira have mad*
very, llttl* progress," said thÂ« j Inspector.
"We have an open carriage outside, -and

Inspector Gregory was full: of his case.
and ; poured; out a stream of remarks.

\u25a0 leaned i back with his arms folded and his

mines upon the moor."
"What does he say about ths cravat?"
"He acknowledges that It is his* and
declares that he had lost It. But a new
element has been JnrroJuced into the
case which may account for his leading
ihfe horse from the stable."
Holmes pricked up his ears...
'"We have found traces . which show
Ui&t a party of gypsies encamped on
Monday nigiit tvithln a mile of the spot
where the / murder took place. On Tues
day they were' gone. Now, presuming
that there was/some understanding be
tween Simpson and these gypsies,
might he njot have been leading the
iiorse to them when he was overtaken,
and may they not have him now?"
"It is certainly possible.".
"The moor is being scoured for these
gypsies. 1 have also examined every
stable and outhouse in Tavistock and
for a radius of ten miles."
"There is another .training stable
<;ulte close. I understand?'*
"Yes. and that is a factor which we
â¢:iust certainly not neglect. As Des
borough, their horse, was second in the
betting, they had an Interest in the dis
appearance of the favorite. Silas
Brown, the trainer, is known to have
i.ad large bets upon the event and he
was no friend to poor Straker. We
have, however, examined the stables
.'.nd there is nothing to connect him
with the affair.
"And nothing to connect this man
Simpsoji with the interests of the Ma
pleton "ftables?"
"Nothing at all."
Holmes leaned back In the carriage,
and the conversation ceased. A few min
utes later our driver pulled up at a neat
little red brick villa with overhanging
eaves which stood by the road. Some dis
tance off. across a paddock, lay a long
giay tiled outbuilding. In every , other
direction the low curves of the moor,
broiize-tolored from the fading ferns,
stretched away to the sky,-line,. broken
only by the steeples of TaVlstock and \y
a cluster of houses away to the westward
which marked the Mapleton stables. We
all sprang out with the exception "of
Holmes, who continued to lean back w!th
his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of
him, entirely absorbed. In, his* \>nvn
thoughts. It was only when I touched
Ills arm that he roused himself with a
violent start and stepped out of the car
riage.
"Excuse me," said he, turning to Colo
nel Ross, who had looked at him in smie
surprise. "I was day-dreaming." There
was a gleam in tils eyes and a suppressed
excitement in his manner which con
vinced me, used as I was to his ways,
that his hand was upon a clew, ihou.jh I
could not Imagine where he had found it.
"Perhaps you would prefer at once to
go on to the scene of the crime, Mr.
Holmes?" said Gregory.
â¢I think that I should prefer to stay
here a little and go into one or two ques
tions of detail. Straker was brought
Lack here, 1 presume?"
"Yes: he lies upstairs. The inquest is
10-incrrow."
"He has been in . your service some
yiars. Colonel Ross?"
"I have always fgund him an excellent
servant.*'
â¢*I presume that you made an Inventory
<jf what he had in hi? pockets at the time
of Iris death, inspector?" â¢
"I have the things themselves in the
sitting-room, if you would care to see
them."
â¢'1 .should be very glad." We all filed
into the front room and sat round the
tentertable while the inspector unlocked
a square tin box and laid a small heap of
things before us. There was a box of
vestas, two Inches of tallow candle, an
ADD brierwocd pipe, a pouch of seal
skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cav
endish, a silver watch with a gold chain,
five sovereigns in gold, a aluminum
pencil case,* a few papers and an ivory
handled knife with a very delicate, in
flexible blade marked Weiss & Co., Lon
don. "\u25a0â¢',Â»::'*.â ' ; .. Â£35
"This is a very singular knife,'" said
Holmes. lifting it up and examining it
minutely. "I presume, as I see the blood
stains upon It, that It is the one which '
was found in the dead man's grasp. Wat
son, this knife is surely in your line?" Â»t
"It Is what we call a cataract knife,"
said L :;,-\u25a0-\u25a0
"I thought co. A very delicate blade,
devised for very delicate work. A strange
thing for a man to carry with him upon
a rough expedition, especially as it would
noT-shut in hla pocket.". - .
"The tip was guarded by a disk of cork
which we found beside his body," paid the
inspector. "His wife tells us. that the
knife had lain upon the' dressing-table
and that he had picked It up as lie left
the room. It was a poor weapon, but
perhaps the best that he could lay his
hands on at the moment." ; '*>
"Very possibly. How about Mhfge pa
pers?" .';â¢;
"Three of them are receipted hay deal-
crs' accounts. Or.c of them la a letter of
instructions from Colonel Ross. This oth
er is a milliner's account for Â£37 15 shill
ings, made out by Madame Lcsaricr of
Bond street to William Derbyshire.' Mrs.
Etraker tells us that Derbyshire .was a
friend of her husband and that occasion
ally his letters were addressed here.'*
"Madame Derbyshire bad somewhat
expensive .tastes," remarked Holmes,
glancing down the account. "Twenty-two
guineas is rather heavy for a single cos
tume. However, there appears to be noth
ir.g mere to learn, aril we may now 'go
down tc the scene of the crime."
As we emerged from the sitting-room a
woman, who had been walking In the>
pabsage. took a step forward and laid her
hand upon the inspector's sleeve. Her
face was haggard and thin .'and eager,
stamped with the print of a recenthor
ror. y
"Have you got them?, Ilave you found
them?" ehe panted. ;
"No. Mrs. Straker. But -Mr. iHoJmfls
here has come from London to help us,
and we shall do all that Is possible."
"Burfly I met you in Plymouth at a
garden party some little time ago, Mrs.
dtrakcr?" said Holmes. :
"No, sir; you are mistaken." ...,;
"Dear me! Why*, I could have sworn to
it. You wore a costume of dove-colored
silk with ostrich feather trimming."
"I never had such a dress, sir," an
swered the lady.
"Ah, that quite settles it," said Holmes.
And 'with an apology he followed the in
spector outside. A short walk across the
moor took us to the hollow In which the
body had been found. At the brink of It
was the furze bush upon which the coat
had been hung.
"There was no wind that night, I under
stand," said Holmes.
"None; but very heavy rain."
"In . that case the overcoat was not
blown against the furze bushes, but
placed there." '
"Yes, it- was laid across the bush."
'*' You fill me"' with interest." I perceive
that the \u25a0 ground ' hau* been: trampled up
a good \ deal/ No floubt many feet ' have

"Excellent."
"In this bag. l have one of the boots
which â¢ Straker wore, one <|f \u25a0 Fitzroy
Simpson's shoes and' a cast- horseshoe of
Silver Blaze." ;
i^'My. dear. Inspector, you surpass your
selfl" Holmes took the, bas,. and. de
sccr.ainj; Into the hollow,; he : pushed the
m rcattlng -, into '- a more central â¢ position.
Then stretching, himself upon his face
and leaningthls chin upon". zr.s hands, he
made a \u25a0 careful^ study of * the trampled
mud. in .front pf, him. "Hullo!" said he
suddenly. "What's" this?" It was a. wax
vesta, -half burned;'* which 1 was so coated
With miid '.-that -It "looked at' first like a
little chip 'of. woo'd.S , \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 ;
"I cannot think "how I came to over
... look It," said c . the Inspector, with an ex
pression of annoyance.
"It was Invisible, burled in the iriud. \u25a0 I
only saw it because I was looking for It."
"What! You expected -to find it?"
"I thought it 'not unlikely.-'
lie took the boots vfrom- the bag . and
compared the impression of each of them.
with marks upon tho" ground. ' Then he
clambered up to thexrim^of the hollow;
and crawled about among the ferns and
bushes. \u25a0 t
"I am afraid that there were no more
tracks," said the Inspector., "I have ex
:imined the ground, very carefully or a
hundred yards in each direction." 3
"Indeed!" >aid Holmes.;, rising. r "I
should not have the impertinence to do
It again after what you ,lsay. But I
should like to have a little walk over the
moor before it grows dark, Ithat I may
know my ground to-morrowyiand I think
that I shall j put this horseshoe into my
PQcket for luck." - \u25a0 .** .'
Colonel Rgss,. who * had - shown some
signs of Impatience at my, companion's
quiet and systematic, method of work,
gianccd at his watch.* V "I, wish, you would
come. back with me, Inspector," said he.
."There are several points -on' which I
should ;lllke" to have your .\* advice, and
especially as to whether, we do not owe
It to the public to reriiovc^our horse's
name from the entriegifor>the;j,cup."
"Certainly not," ;crfed- Holmes with'
decision. "I should j; let .the. name
stand." . \u25a0' ' ,K'--'^. '!.'\u25a0
The colonel bowed. v"I am very glad
to have had your opinion,' sir," :'sald he.
"You will find us at ;poor ."; Straker's
house when you have; finished. ; your
walk and. we can drive I together j into
Tavistock."
\u2666 He turned back with the inspector,
while Holmes and I walked slowly
across the moor. The sun was begin
ning to sink behind tne stable of'
Mapleton and the long, sloping plain
In front of us was tinged Â» with-; gold,
deepening into rich, ruddy s ibrowns
where the faded ferns ; and brambles I
caught the evening light. But -the
glories of the landscape were all wast
ed upon my companion, wno was. sunk
In the deepest thought.
"It's this way, Watson," said he at
last. "We may .leave the Tjuestlon of
who killed John Straker for the in
stant and confine ourselves to 'finding
out what haÂ» become of the . horse.
Now supposing that he broke away
during or after the tragedy, where
could Ire have gone to? The. horse Is
a very gregarious creature. If left to
himself his Instincts would have been
either to rcUirn to j King's Pylarid or
go over to Mapleton. -Why should he
run wild upon, the^moor? ..He would
surely have been-.seen r by, now. .. And".
why should gypsies kidnap him?. These ,
people always., clear, "out when they.
hear of trouble, for they do, not wish
to be pestered' by the police. They^
could not hope to sell such a horse. .
They would run a great risk and gain
nothing by taking him. Surely, that is
clear." \u25a0';%>'
â¢ "Where is he. then?"
"I have already said that he must
have gone to King's Pyland <Jr to
Mapleton. He Is not at King's Pyland. ,:
Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let us
take that as a working hypothesis and
see what It leads us to. This part of
the moor, as the inspector remarked.
Is very hard and . dry. But It falls
away toward Mapleton, '; and you can
ccc from here that there .Is a : long
hollow over yonder, which must have
been very wet on Monday night. If
our supposition is correct, then \u25a0 the
horse must have crossed that and .there
is the point where we should look for *
his tracks,"
We had been walking . briskly dur
ing this conversation and a few more
minutes brought ; us to ' the hollow in.
questlori. At Holmes' request. l walked
down the bank to the right and he to
the left, but I bad'not taken fifty
paces before I heard him give a shout
and saw him waving his hand to me.*
The track of -a horse- was plalnlyout
llned In the soft earth i In. front of him
and the shoewhieh he took from his
pocket exactly fitted the impression.

Holmes. "It is the one . quality which
Gregory lacks. We imagined. what might

when I pointed.it out. '"You have saved

We had not to go -far. \u25a0; It ended at the
paving of" asphalt which ledi up to tne;
gates of .the -Mapleton stables. As we
approached; a. groom ran out from them.
JJWe don't want any loiterers about
here," said he.
"I only wished to ask a question," 'said
Holmes, with hia finger and thumb in
his waistcoat pockets. '/Should I be too
early, to see your "Mr. Silas

"Bless you, sir. if any one is about he

As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half
crown which he had drawn ; from his .
pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man
strode out from the gate with a hunting
crop ; swinging in his hand. .
VWhat's this, Dawson?" he cried. "No
gossiping! Go about your business! And

' ."A more perfect compound of the bully,

marked Holmes as we trudged along to

"He has the horse, then?"
"He tried to bluster out of It, but I de
scribed, to him so exactly .what his- ac
tions had been upon that morning that
he Is convinced that I was watching him..
Of 1 1 course," you observed the peculiarly
square in the impressions, 5 and that
his own boots exactly correspond to
them. Â»Agaln, of course no subordinate
would have dared do such a thing. I de
scribed to 'him how, when according to
his 'custom he. was the first down, he-,
perceived a strange horse wandering over
the moor. ; How he went out to it, and
his astonishment at recognizing, from the
white, forehead which has given the fa
votlte B .Us name,: that chance had put in
his power the ; only horse which could
beat the one upon -which he had' his
money. Then I described .how his first

shown him how. he could hide .the. horse

led It back and concealed it at Mapleton.

handsome photographs, the low book

cfthe events which had occurrea ai
the Dartmoor : training stables upon
that Monday' night and the means/by
which he had. unraveled them. : *"
"I confess," said he., "that* any the
ories which; I jhad formed" from the
'newspaper reports were entirely er
roneous.., 1 And yet "there were indica
tions "there; had "they not been over
laid br other details which concealed
their true Import. I went to De\*on
'shire with the conviction that Fitzroy
Simpson was the true culprit, although
of v course :Isaw Vthat the evidence
asuinst : him was by rio s mean3 .com
plete. '. : It was ; while I . was in the car
riag-o, Just aa we reached the trainer's
house, that the immense significance of
the 'curried mutton occurred 4 to vine.
â¢-You* mav remember that I. was distrait,
"and 'remained sitting after you had all
alighted. I was marveling ;in . tny own
mind how I could possibly have 'over
looked so obvious a clew." â¢ , .
Xi confess." said, the colonel, "that
'even now. I. cannot see how it. helps
us-." â¢â¢" . . . .
: '"It was the first^llnk In my chain of
\u25a0jensdnihgr. Powdpred opium; Is by-no
means tasteless. â¢ flavor is not'dis
agreeable,' but it -Is perceptible. s Were
it mixed with any ordinary. dish . the
eater iwould undoubtedly detect It and
would" projbably.; eat no more.' A ctirry
'was' exactly the medium which. would
disguise this taste. By no possible sup
position could this stranger,* Fltzrov,
Simpson, have caused curry to .be
>erved In the trainer's family ,-. that
night, and it Is surely, too monstrous a
coincidence to suppose^ that he hap
pened to come along with i powdered
opium upon the very night when a dish
happened to be- served .which .would
disguise the flavor/ That la unthink
able. Therefore Simpson; becomes
eliminated from the case, and oar.^at
tention centers upon Straker' and his
wife, the only two people who could
have chosen curried mutton for sup
per that night. The opium was added
after the dish was set aside for the
stable boy, for the others bad the
same for supper with no ill effects.
Which of them, then, had access to
that dish without the maid seeing
them? , _ . .
"Before deciding that question I had
â¢ grasped the significance of the silencw of
the dog. for one true Inference Invariably
suggests others. The -Simpson incident
had shown mo that a dog was kept tq the
stables, and yet, though, some one had
been 'ln and fetched out a horse, he had
not barked enough to arouse the tyro lads
in' the loft. Obviously the rmdnig.lt
visltor'waa some one whom the dig: knew
well.
"I .was already convinced, or almost
convinced, that John Straxer went down
to" the. stables In the dead of the night
and took out Silver Blaze. For . what
purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously,
or why should he drus n:a own stable
boy? And yet I was at a loss to know
why. . There have been cases before now
where trainers have made sure of great
?ums _oÂ£ money by laying against their
owii horses through agents, and then pre
venting them from winning by fraud.
Sometimes it Is a pulling jockey. Some
times it is some surer and subtler means.
What was It here? I hoped that the con
tents . of his pockets might help me to
form ' a conclusion.
fc "And they did so. You cannot have
forgotten the singular knife which was
found in the dead man's nand, a knife
which certainly no sane man wnulif
. choose . for. a weapon. It was. as Dr.
Watson told us. a form o? xnife whicU
'Is .used for the most delicate operation.*
known to surgery. And it was to be used
.for a delicate operation that ois&t. You
must, know." with your wtda experience '
of turf matters, ColonSl Ross,' that it' Lj '
possible to make a slight nick upon the
.tendons of a horse's ham and to do it
subcutaneously, so aa to leave absolutely
no trace. A horse so treated would de
velop a slight lameness, which would be
put down to a strain in exercise or a
touch of rheumatism, but never to foul
play."
"Villain! Scoundrel!" cried the colonel.
"We have here the explanation of why
John f>traker wished to take the horse
out on to. the moor. So spirited a crea
ture would certainly have roused the
soundest of sleepera when It felt the
prick of the knife. It was absolutely
necessary to do It in the open air."
"I have been blind!" cried the colonel.
"Of course that was why. he needed the
candle, and struck the match."
"Undoubtedly. But In examining his be
lcngings I was fortunate enough ,to dis
cover not only the method of the crime,
but even Its motives. As a man of the
vcrld, colonel, you know that men do
not carry other people's bills about In their
pockets. We have most of us quite
enough to do to settle our own. I at
once concluded that Straker was leading
a double life and keeping a second estab
lishment. The nature of the bill showed
that there was a lady in the case, and
one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as
you are with your servants, one can
hardly, expect that they can buy twenty
guinea walking dresses for their ladles.
1 questioned Mrs. Straker as to the dress
without her knowing it. and having sat
isrieri myself that it bad never reached
her. I made a note of the milliner's ad
dress, and felt that by calling there with
Straker' 3 photograph I could easily dis
pose of the mythical Derbyshire.
"From that time on all was plain.
Straker had led oat the horse to a hol
low where his light would be Invisible.
Simpson in his flight had dropped his cra
vat, and Straker had picked It upâ with
some idea, perhaps, that hs might use It
in securing the horse's leg. Ones In the
hollow, he had got behind the hone and
had struck a light; but the creature,
frightened at the sudden glare, and with
the strange instinct of x animals feeling
that some mischief was Intended, had
lashed out, and the steel shoe had struck
Straker full on the forehead. He had
airtady. in spite of the rain, taken oft his
overcoat In order to do his delicate task,

CHAPTER 1.
CT^HE young Frenchman did very
| well what he had planned to do.
j His guess that the Duke would
J^ cheat proved good. As the un
ahod half-dozen figures that had
been standing: noiselessly in the entry
way stole eoftly Jnto the shadows of
tho chamber, he leaned across the table
and smilingly plucked a card out of the
big Englishman's sleeve.
"Mercl. M. le Due!" he laughed, rising
and stepping back from the table.
The Englishman cried out, "It means
the dirty work of silencing you with
raj* bare hands: 11 and came at him. ?
"Do not move," said M. Beaucaire, so
aharply that the other paused. "Ob
serve behind you."
The Englishman, turned, and saw
what trap he had blunaered into; then
stood tritnenxetl, impotent, alternately
scarlet with rage and white with the
vital shame of aiscovery. M. Beaueaire
remarked, indicating tne silent injures
by a polite wave of the hand, "Is it not
a compliment to monsieur that 1 pro
cure six. large men to subdue him?
They are Quite devote" to me, and mon
sieur is.alone. Could it be that he did
not wish even his lackeys to know he
play with the yo'ng Frenchman who
Lieestaire Nash dots not like In the
pomp-room? Monsieur is unfortunate
to have come on foot alone to my
apartment."
The Duke's mouth foamed over with
chaotic revilement. His captor smiled
y i. rightly, and made a slight gesture, as
one who brushes aside a boisterous in
sect. With the same motion he quelled
to stony quiet a resentful impetus of
liis servants toward the Englishman.
"lt'6 murder, is it, you carrion!" fin
ished the Duke.
M. Beaucaire lifted his shoulders In
a mock sliiver. "'What words! No, no,
no! No killing! A such word to &
such host: No, no, not mur-r-der; only
disgrace:" He laughed a clear, light
laugh with a rising inflection, seeming
to launch himself upon an adventurous
quest for sympathy.
"You little devilish scullion:" spat
out the Duke.
"Tut, tut! But I forget. Monsieur
has pursue' his studies of deportment
amorigs' his fellow-countrymen."
"Do you dream a soul in Bath will
take your word that I â that Iâ"I â " - c
r.'That JI-1* Due de Winterset had a
card \jp his sleeve?"
"You pitiful stroller, you stable-boy,
born in a stable â "
"Is it not an honor to be born where
monsieur must have been bred?"
"Tou scurry foot-boy, you greasy
barber, you cutthroat groom â *
"Overwhelm'!" The young man
bowed with imperturbable elation. *'M
le Due appoint' me to all the office 1 of
his househol'."
"You mustachioed fool, there are not
five people of quality in Bath will speak
to you â "
"No, monsieur, not on the parade; but
how many come to play with me here?
I Because I will play always, night o<
day, for what one will, for any long,
and cl â ways fair,* monsieur."
"Tou outrageous varlet! Every one
knows you came to England as the
French Eir.bassador"s barber. "What
man of fashion will listen to you? Who
will believe you?"
"AJI people, monsieur. Do you think
I have not calculate,' that I shall make
a failure of my little enterpriser*
"Ban!"
"Will monsieur not reseat himself?"
M. Beaucaire made a low bow. "So. We
Brest not be too tire' for Lady Mal
bource's rout. Ha, ha! And you. Jean,
Victor, and you others, retire; go In the
hallway. Attend at the entrance, Fran
cola. 60; now we shall talk. Monsieur,
I wish you to think very cool. Then
listen; I will be briefly. It is that I
am wall known to be all. entire' bones'.
Gaxnbllst? Ah, yes; true and mos"
profitable; but fair; al â ways fair;
every one say that. Is it not so? Think*
of it. \u25a0 Andâ is there never a w'lsper
come to M. le Due that not all people
belief him to play al â ways hones'? Ha,
hat Did It alrnos" be said to him las'
year, after when he play* with Mllor*
Tappln'ford at the chocolate house â "
"You dirty scandal-monger!" the
Duke burst out. 'TU â "
"Monsieur, monsieur!" said the
Frenchman. "It is a poor valor to In
tuit a helpless captor. Can he retort
.upon his own victim? But it is for you
\u25a0\\o think of what I say. True, lam not
reco'nizo on the parade; that my frien's
who come, her* do not present me to
their ladies; that Meestalre Nash has
reboff* me in the pomp-room; still, am I
not known for being hones' and fair in
' my play, and will I not be belief", even
I, when I Ilf* my voice and charge you
aloud with what is already w'lsper?
Think of It! You are a noble, and there
will be some hang-dogs who might not
fall away from you. Only such would
be lef to you. Do you want it tor?
And you can keep out of France, mon
sieur? I have lef' his service, but I
have etlll the ear of M. de Mlrepoix,
and he know* I never lie. Not a gen
tleman will play you when you come to
Paris."
The Englishman's white lip showed
a row of scarlet dots upon it. "How
much do you want?" he said.
The room rang with the gay laughter
of Beaucaire. "I hoi* your note' for
seven-hunder* pound*. You can have
them, monsieur. Why does a such great
man come_to play M. Beaucaire? Be
cause not one else wlllin* to play M. le
Dve â he cannot pay. Ha, ha! So he
come* to good Monsieur Beaucaire.
Money, ha, ha! What I want with
money?"
His Grace of Winterset's features
were set awry to a sinister pattern. He
rat glaring at his companion in a
snarling silence.
"Money? Pouf!" snapped the little
gambler. "No, no,, no! It is that M.
le Due, impoverish', somewhat in a bad
odor aa he Is, yet command the entree
jany- where â onless I â Ha, ha!* Eh,
-^onsieur?" - \u0084
* "Ha! You dare think to force me â "
M. Beaucaire twirled the tip of his
slender mustache around the end of his
white forefinger. Then he said:. "Mon
sieur and me goln* to Lady Malbourne's
ball to-night-M. le Due and me!"
MONSIEUR BEAUCAIRE
The Englishman roared, "Curse your
impudence!"
**Slt quiet. Oh, yes, that's all; we
goin* together."
"No!"
"Certain. I make all my little plan*.
f Tis all arrange." He paused, and then
said gravely, "You goin* present me to
Lady Mary Carlisle."
The other laughed in utter scorn.
"Lady Mary Carlisle, of all women
alive, would be the first to prefer the
devil to a man of no birth, barber."
'"Tis all arrange'; have no fear; no
body question monsieur's guest. You
groin' take me to-night â "
"Yes. And after â then I have the
entree. Is it much I ask? This one
little favor, and I .never w'lsper, never
breathe that â It is to say, I am always
forever silent of monsieur's, misfor
tune." *
"You have the entree'" sneered the
other. "Go to a lackeys' rout and
dance with the kitchen maids. If I
would, I could not present you to Bath
society. I should have cartels from
the fathers, brothers and lovers of
every wench and madam in the place.,
even L You would be thrust from
Lady Melbourne's door five minutes
after you entered It."
"No, no, no!"
"Half the gentlemen in Bath have been
here to play. They . would know you,
wouldn't they, fool? You've had thou
sands out of Bantison, Rakell, Guilford
and Townbrake. They would have you
lashed by the grooms as your ugly
deserts are. You to speak to Lady Mary
Carlisle! 'Od's blood! You! Also, dolt,,
she would know you if you escaped the
others. She etood within a yard of you
when Nash expelled you the pump-room."
M. Beaucaire flushed slightly. "You
think I did not seer* he asked.
"Do you dream that because Winterset
â¢ Introduces a low fellow he will be toler
atedâthat Bath will receive a barber?"
"I have the distinction to call mon
sieur's attention," replied the young man
gaily, "I have renounce' that profes
sion."
"Fool!"
"I am now a man of honor!"
"Faughl"
"A .man of the parts," continued the
young Frenchman, "and of deportment;
is it not so? Have you seen me of a
fluster, or gross ever, or, what shall I
sayâ bourgeois? Shall you be shame' for
your guest' manner? No, no! And my
appearo&Â£Â£, is It of the people? Clearly,
no. Do f flat compare in taste of apparel
with your yo'ng Englishman? Ha> ha!
To be hotMr", Ha, ha! So I am goln'
talk with LaAy Mary Carlisle."
"Bah!" The Duke made a savage bur
lesque. " 'Lady Mary Carlisle, may I
assume the honor of presenting the bar
ber of the Marquis de Mirepoix?' So,'
is It?" \u25a0.- : i .; r$M
"No, monsieur," smiled the young man.
"Quite not â¢ so. You shall have nothing
to worry you, ; nothing in the wort': I
am goln' to assassinate my poor, mus
tachloâalso ' remove this horrible black
peruke, and emerge in my own 'â¢ hair.
Behol'!" He .swept the, heavy, curled |
mass from his head as he spoke, and his
hair, colled . under the great wig, : fell
to his shoulders, and sparkled yellow in
the candle-light He ; tossed his head to
shake the hair back from his cheeks.

"When id is dress', I am transform'; no

little bit. No one shall reco'nlze [ 'M.

"Curse you, said the Duke, "do you
think I'm going to be saddled with you
.wherever I go as long as you choose?"
"A mistake. No. All I requiâ All I
begâ is this one evening. 'Tis all shall be
necessary. After. I shall not need mon
sieur."
"Take ; heed , to yourself â after!" vouch
safed the Englishman between his teeth.
"Conquered!" eried \u25a0 M. Beaucaire, and
clapped his hands gleefully.: "Conquered
for the night! Aha; it is riz'nable! I
1 shall meet what you sendâ after. One
cannot hope too much of your patience.

looked at the Duke curiously. "You want
to know why I create ; this r tragedy, whj |
I am so unkind ; as to entrap monsieur?"
His Grace of : Wlnterset replied* with a
chill glance ; a pulse , in ' the nobleman's
cheek beat less relentlessly; his eye raged
not so bitterly; the steady purple of his
own color was returning; his ! voice j was j
less- hoarse; he was regaining his habit.
"'Tis ever the manner of ' the vulgar,"
he observed, "to wish to be seen with
people of v fashion."
"Oh,* > no, no,"" no!" The Frenchman
laughed. "'Tis not that. Am I not al- '

at Lady , Malbourne's door,' where the
Joyous vulgar fought with muddled foot
men and tipsy link-boys for places or
vantage | whence to catch - a glimpse of
quality and of raiment â¢at its utmost.
Dawn was in the east," and the guests
were departing. Singly or in pairs, glit
tering in finery, they came mincing down
the steps, the ghost of the night's smirk
fading to.; jadedness as they sought the
dark â¢ recesses of their chairs. From
within sounded the twang" of -fiddles still
swinging manfully at It, and the. windows
were bright with the light of many
candles. When, the door was flung open
to call the Chair of Lady Mary Carlisle,
there was an eager pressure of the throng
to see.' ... - "" .. : - "\u25a0 . .\u25a0\u25a0-.-..â¢
A small, fair gentleman in white satin
came out upon the steps; turned and
bowed before a lady who appeared In
the doorway, a lady whose royal loveli
ness was given to view, for a moment
In that glowing frame. The crowd sent
up a hearty English cheer for the Beauty
of Bath.
The gentleman . smiled upon them de
lightedly. "What 'enchanting people!"
he cried. "Why did I not know. -so"!
might have shout' with them?" The lady
noticed the people not at , all; whereat,
being pleased, the people cheered again.
The gentleman offered her his hand; -she
made a slow' courtesy; placed the tips
of her fingers upon his own. "I am hon
ored, M. de Chateaurien," she said. _
"No, no!" he cried earnestly. â¢ "Behol*
a poor. Frenchman whom Emperors should
envy." :- : Then .reverently and .' with the
pride of his gallant office vibrant in
every line of his. light figure, invested in
white satin and very grand, as. he had
prophesied. .M. le Due de Chateaurien
handed Lady; Mary Carlisle down the
steps, an achievement which had figured
in the ambitions of seven other gentle
men "during, the evening. -; Â«
"Am I to be lef in such onhappiness?"
he said in a low voice. "That rose I

"Never!" said Lady Mary.
"Ah, I do not deserve it, I know so

"Never!"

CHAPTER 111.
'\'Twas ? well ' agreed 'by the > fashion^. of
Bath \ that M.^le Due de Chateaurien was
a" person ; of ? sensibility* arÂ«^"haut ? ton 1 / :
that i his '* retinue*; and 'I equipage surpassed
ml elegance ; I that r < his person t was j. ex-
Â«iuislte, his manner engaging. In the
company of centlemen his ease was
slightly tinged with " graciousnesa (hl3
single equal in Bath being his Grace of
Winterset); but it was remarked that
wh'en he bowed over a lady's hand his
air bespoke only a gay and tender rever
ence. .
He was the idol of the dowagers within
a week after his appearance; matrons
warmed to him: young belles looked
sweetly on him. while the gentlemen were
won to admiration or envy- He was of
prodigious wealth: old Mr. Blcksit, who
dared not. for his fame's sake, fall to
have seen all things, had visited ,Cha
teaurien under the present Duke's father,
and descanted to ' the curious upon its
grandeurs. The young noble had one
fault, he was so poor a gambler. He
cared nothing for the hazards of a die
or the; turn of a card. Gaily admitting
that he had been born with no spirit of
adventure in him, he was sure, he de
clared, that he failed of much happiness
by 'his lack of. taste in such matters.
But he was not long wanting- the- oc
casion to prove hi 3 taste in the matter
of -handling a weapon. A certain led
captain, Rohrer by name, notorious,
among other things, for bearing a dex
terous and bloodthirsty blade, came to
Bath post-haste, one night, and jostled
heartily against him in the pump-room
on the following morning. M. de Cha
teaurien bowed, and turned aside without
offense, , continuing a conversation . with
some gentlemen nearby. Captain Rohrer
jostled acainst him a second time." M.
de Chateaurien looked him in the eye,
and apologized pleasantly for* being so
much in the way. Thereupon Rohrer
procured an . introduction to him, and
made some observations derogatory to
the valor and virtue of the French.
There was current, a curious piece of
gossip of the French court: a Prince of
the blood * royal, grandson of the late
Regent and second in the line of succes
sion to the throne of France, 'had re
belled against the authority of Louis XV.,
who had commanded him to marry the
Princes; Henrlette, cousin of # both" of
them. The Princess was reported to be
openly devoted to the cousin who refused
to accept her hand at the bidding of the
King; and, as rumor ran. the Prince's
caprice elected in preference the discipline
of Vincennes, to which retirement the
furious IClng had consigned j him. - Tho
story was. the staple gossip of all polite
Europe; and Captain Rohrer, having In
his mind a purpose to make use of it
in leading up .to a statement that should
be general to the damage of all French
women, and which a Frenchman might
not pass over as he might a jog of the
elbow, repeated it with garbled truths
to make a scandal of a story which bore
none on a plain relation.
He did not reach his deduction. M. Â£â¢
Chateaurien, breaking into his I narrative,
addressed him very quietly. , "Monsieur."
he said, "none but swine deny the noble
ness of that good and gentle, lady. Made

It is clearly shown that the Duke of
Orleans is a : scurvy fellow, but notâ "
he wheeled about and touched Captain
Rohrer on the. brow with the back- of his
gloved handâ "but not so scurvy as thou,
thou ; swine of the gutter!"
Two hours later, with perfect ease, he
ran Captain Rohrer through tbe left
shoulderâ after which he sent a basket
of red roses to the \u25a0 Duke of â¢ Wlnterset.
In .a" few days he '. had . another captain
to fight. This .: was a ruffling buck who
had the astounding Indiscretion to pro-
I claim M. de Chateaurien an impostor.
â¢ There ,was no \u25a0" Chateaurien, he swore.
The Frenchman'; laughed in his face, and.
at twilight lof the same day, â¢ pinked him
carefully i through the * right shoulder. x ; ft
was not that |he could not put aside the
insult - to himself, *he declared to Mr.
r Molyneux, his second, and the few wit
nesses, .: as s he handed his wet \u25a0; sword to
: his i lackeyâ one of his station could not
be by a doubt ; of,, that stationâ
but' he fought i in the quarrel of , his friend
I Wlnterset. /This; rascal had asserted that
M. le : Due ' had '; introduced ," an impostor."
': Could i he overlook the insult 'to a' friend,
'one ito whom ; he owed * his ] kind reception
In Bath? "Then." bending over his ' fallen
adversary,-; he ".whispered ;' ''Naughty man,
tell your master .: find; soine. better quarrel
for the nex'..' he sen" agains* â me." ' ,
The- conduct of I M.; de Chateaurien was
pronounced' admirable.
There was no surprise when the your.?
foreigner fell naturally into the long train
of followers of the beautiful Lady Mary
Carlisle, nor was there great astonish
ment that he should obtain marked favor
in her eyes, shown so plainly that my
Lord Townbrake. Sir Hugh Gullford and
the rich scuire Bantlson, all of whom
had followed her through three seasons,
swore with rase, and bis Grace of "Win
terset stalked from her aunt's house
with black brows.
Meeting the Duke there on tho evening
after his second encounter, De Chateau
rlen smiled upon him brilliantly. "It was
badly done; oh. so badly" he. 'whispered.
"Can you afford to have me strip* of my
mask by any but yourself? You, who
Introduce' me? They will say there is
some bad scandal that I could force* you
to be my god-father. You mus* get the
courage yourself."
"I told you a rose had a short Ufa,"
was the answer.
"Oh, those roses!' "Tis the very greates*
rizzon to gather each day a fresh one."
He took a red bud from his breast for
an instant, and touched It to his lips.
"M. de Chateaurien!." It was Lady
Mary's voice; she stood at a table where
a vacant place had been left besid* her.
"M. de Chateaurien. we have been wait
ing very long for you."
The Duke saw the look sh* did not
know she gave the Frenchman, and ho
lost countenance for - a moment.
"We approach a climax, eh, monsienrT*
said M. de Chateaurien.
CHAPTER FOUR.
There fell a clear September night, irbta
the moon was radiant ovtr town and
country, over cobbled streets and winding
roads. From the fields tho mist roÂ»Â«
slowly, and the air was mild and
fragrant, while distances were whit* and
full of mystery. All of Bath that pro

of a country gentleman of the neighbor

cluded. It was tha pleasuro of M. do
Chateaurien to form on* of tho escort of
Lady Mary's carriage for tho return. Aa
they took tho road. Sir Hugh Oullford
and Mr. Bantlson. engaging In Indistinct
but vigorous remonstrance with Mr.
Molyneux over some matter, fell fifty or
more paces behind, where they continued
to ride, keeping up their argument. Halt

muttering among themselves or at
tended laxly upon Lady Mary's aunt
on the other side of tho coach, while tho
happy Frenchman was permitted to rldo
close to that adorable window whlca
framed tho fairest face in England.
He sang for her a little French song,
a song of the "voyageur" who dreamed
of home. The lady, listening, looking U9
at. the bright moon, felt a warm drop
upon her cheek, and he saw tbe tear*
sparkling upon her lashes.
. "Mademoiselle," ho whispered then, "I.
too, have been a wanderer, but my
dreams were not of France; no, I do not
dream of that home, of that dear coun
try. It is of a dearer country, a d ream
countryâ a \u25a0 country of gold and snow,"
he cried softly, looking at her whlto
t brow and the fair, lightly powdered hair
above it. "Gold and snow, and tho toiuo
sky of a laSy's eyes". .
"I had thought the ladles of Franco
were : dark." sir."
"Cruel! It, la that sho will not under
stan*! Have I speak of - the ' ladles of
France? No, no, no! It. is of the falres*
country; yes. 'tis a province of heaven,
mademoiselle. Do I not renounce my al
legiance to Franca? Oh. yest I am
subjec*â no, content to be slaveâ in tho
lan* of the blue sky, tho gold and th'o
snow."
"A- very pretty figure," answered Lady
Mary, her eyes downcast "But does it
not hint a notable experlenco to tho mak
ing of such speeches r*
â¢"Tormentress! No. It prove* only tho
inspiration it is to know you."
"We English ladle 3 hear plenty, ox thÂ»
like, sir: and we even grow brilliant
enough to detect the assurance. that lies
beneath the courtesies of 'our own gal
lants." ,
' "Merci! I should believe so!" ejacu

ered the words upon hl3 1103.

Duty of the Mayor. y
The Mayor must know that be fa the .mere' custodian of the people's'; .
jowrr.
It Is your right that tbe non-partiKan character of the commissioners
and the ei\ll service provisions of the charter be strictly observed.
The Mayor should appoint to office men who are not only scrupulous in
tlieir integrity, bat who' have the training and capacity 'to .perform their'
variotis duties. . "';- - \u25a0 .- ;
Onr first oiHeial iÂ«!iould dare to recognize no distinction of eIaNN, reli

banded justice. . '
San Francisco Hbould demand that at whatever sacrifice to his own per
sonal welfare, the V.n>or devote bis best energies to the maintenance nnd
promotion of induijtrial peace. . ..
You have n right to expect of the 'Mayor that! by right living, devo
tion io his duties and Industry he set n . good example to the. â¢ young, men
upon whom our hopes of the' future dr.: end. ' '.;'.' "\u25a0* ' " : . . J
Yon have a right to ask' the Mayor to vigorously and. with real ' sin
cerity endeavor to make effective that' provision 'of .'the- charter \u25a0 which."de
clares In favor of the acquisition of various'. public ntilitieÂ». . ...
The power of the Mayor can be exercised for ' the Teal advancement
of the city, and the real welfare of the people only when", the
of the office is actuated by complete and thoroughgoing unselfishness.
An honest city government will see to it that the permanent members
of the government, such as the police, tbe firemen, the, teachers nnd. tl)e
rlvll service employes, be secure and free, and that nothing, be^required ,
of them but the faithful peribrmance of their duties. *'. . \ -' : $
To discharge his duty properly, the Mayor must exercise con slant, su
pervision over all 'the departments of the government, just as the manager,
of any other large business would do, to the^ end that Its functions may
be exercised with the greatest possible efficiency, with the leant possible
expenditure of the taxpayer*' money. ,
The bead of our city government should see to it that such things as .
licenses and permits shall be granted only in accordance with the provl- .
sinns of the charter, with not one dollar of expense to those who nre en-:
titled to them, and shall be sternly refused when the law or the good of
the community demand their refus"!. >..*-

What He Will Do.
This Is your light, not mine. I a 111 absolutely sincere when I say that t
have not had one selfish desire In this whole matter. ;
What I'm going to try to do is to uphold and enforce the law,* wherever
it is found. The law recognises no distinction of wealth, class, religion or
political bins, but looks to the good of nil and gives to every man an equal
1 have said,' and I repeat, that the nomination coining in the' way It did.
left me absolutely free to do my whole duty to tbe people, with no ' obli
gation whatever to any person or party, and free -I nm going to remain to
I Intend making a campaign with no. promises except tQs the people,
fto that if I am elected I can be Mayor of the whole people, so tJiat lcun
be not only Mayor, bnt the Mayor's attorney and the Mayor's manager and
the Mayor's closest and moat confldenttr.l adviser.
It is no new fight with me.' L>ast year, when the Integrity of our courts
was In danger, I fought the name tight out in ray own district and the N peo- "
pie of the Blisslon stood by me. I refused to do politics then, and, in spite
of what anybody may say, I decline to do politics now.
I want to tnlk to as many of you ns I can and tell you that this In not
my. personal fight, bnt that almost the very, existence of the city is staked
upon the iasur, nnd whether I win or lose I intend to lie able to come. back
and grasp yon by the hand and look you in the eye us one who has fought'
a fair tight and dpne hi* best.
I don't propose that any department shall be used to a build ; up ii ma
chine, but particularly the police and firemen.* The' police officers are to
protect life and property and the firemen to put out fires, and none of them
Khali be asked to do anything else. That's what the law says and what the
good of the community demands, and I tell you It shall' be done.

ORATORY is not an art.
Oratory is not a cultivated ac
complishment.
Oratory is not a heaven-sent
gift.
Oratory is not a matter of mere lan
guage, of elocution, and of gesture.
It Is not even a matter of talent.
It is not a thing that one man can
teach to another.
All these things the Master of the
Spoken Word tells me when I ask him
for the recipe for the making of orators,
for ths improving of those already made.
Nothing jould be more opportune than
the visit of the Hon. William Bourke
Cockran at this moment.
Bourke Cockran, to give- him the fa
*nHtÂ»r name that fame has simplified the
Inscription on visiting card Into, is
â¢aslly the foremost orator of the country
â *nd this is the season for oratory.
Our nights are rampant with It. You
can't walk along the street without
catching snatches of it that float from
th* open doors and windows of packed
halls wherÂ© audiences sit in solid mass
listening to It. Our daily papers are full
Â«* Itâ shorn of Its resonance and intona
tion and personal charm. Every orator
ft all partiesâ publicly recognized or self-
â¢uepectedâ is either engaged in declaring
hi* sentimentsâ or his sentencesâ from the
platform, or in eagerly and furtively
watching to catch the chairman's eye and
Cet his chance to clear his throat and
realize the dream of his life that begins
with "Ladles and Gentlemen," or "Fel
low Citizens."
Thisâ may I repeat?â is the season of
oratory, and because it is, and because
come of the oratory is' so good and so
much of it Isâ well, not so good, I feel
that I am doing missionary work in
peeking out Bourke Cockran in his red
brocade sitting-room at the St. Francis
and asking him for the recipe 'for mak
ing orators.
Who. Indeed, should he better able tt.
SivÂ© the reciDe than this man who has
held thousand's hanging upon his every
word, who has swayed them to laughter
and to tears, and to convictions, with a
breath as light as the summer breeze
that sweeps across a graiirticld, bending
the ripening heads in unison? â¢
And he says
That you can't make them. That you
can't take a little of this and a little of
that out of any curriculum, mix well,
and produce an orator.
He sajs that there is just one requisite
In the makins of an orator, just one
thing which, having it, he may be an
orator, and that wanting !t he can never
hope to be an urator. but only a spouting
charlatan, a CeclaSming mountebank.
And that one tiling !s
SlNCERlTYâ absolute sincerity.
"The power of the orator, his hold upon
his hearer?, depends upon his sincerity.
I do not mear. by that merely that he
must believe what he says. That is the
commonest, the most elementary sincer
ity. He must go higher than that and be
lieve in his purpose. He must not only
have convictions, but he must feel tl>e
necessity and the duty of Impressing those
convictions upon others.
"Sincerity Is the first essential of sac
cess in an orator.
"Nothing can supply its lack, and noth
ing can increase its efficiency."
In his voice of gold Bourke Cockran
tells me thisâ that wonderful voice of his
that I have heard ringing in sweetest,
dearest bugle notes from end to end of
a creat hall and that is now modulated
to an exquisite fineness that just reaches
with bÂ«autiful distinctness from his red
easy chair to mine. It is a voice vibrant,
caressing, warm with feeling, flexible as
some tangible thing.
"And what else does he need?" I ask.
"Nothingâ nothing at all."
Bourke Cockran puts Just the faintest
edgeâ the feather edge of a brogue on
the word "nothing," and you'd almost
swear he'd said "thim" and "thin" in
stead of "them." and "then." if only your
ear could Quicken to catch it; and the
The Culture of Culturine
Fables for tHe Foolish
<ra yt US. TOPLOFTY-JONES was af
/\y\ Cicted with a mighty longing
i < I to rise above her appointed
/- / JL station In life. Her father had
landed In town armed principally with a
carpet bag and a brown umbrella with a
blue string tied around the middle. He had
got In on the ground floor of a soap
factory and lard emporium and when he
departed this life he left behind him an
, all-prevading scent of soap grease in the
atmosphere and a little memento at the
bank that would suffice to keep his
widow and daughter on the sunny side
of Easy street. His daughter, whose name
was Mary Ann abbreviated to Mariana,
married the son of old 'Bije Jones, who
began his career as valet to a brlndle
cow and a team of white-faced mules and
wound up as the owner of three or four
townships and the Peacock Junction
Bank. ' 'â¢
Soon after the old folks departed for
parts unknown, but variously guessed at
by people who knew them well, the
Joneses made up their minds to migrate
to the city, where they could see a little
real life and -wash some of the soap
grease and prairie soil off their filthy
lucre. The first step that they took
toward getting away, from their ancestors
was to telescope their name and run It as
a double header. Toplofty-Jones Is ln
doubtedly much more cultured than plain
Jones and takes more space on a visiting
card Mrs. Toplofty expected to be In
vited around to the Astorbilts for dinner
the first night on Fifth avenue and sat
up till nine o'clock with her diamonds
draped around her so that she could go
in with the soup. When the Invitation
failed to turn up she concluded that it
wraith of brogue that hovers on his
tongue Rives an added richness to his
converse like cream In a cup of good
coffee.
"It is in sincerity first, last and al
ways that the power of the orator lies.
"He must have something to say, and
he must believe that he should say It."
"Butâ the voice?" I ask, thinking of his
own.
\u25a0 "Yes, the voice is necessary; but I have
never known any speaker who had any
thing to say and the conviction that he
must say it. who had this lirst requisite
of sincerity, who didn't have voice enough
to say it with; I have never known one
waose voice was inadequate."
"And the rhetoric? The flowers of -
speech?"
"The most effective oratory is that of
the speaker who has something to say
and who says it in the most direct way
possible, who bends his effort to con
veying his thought to his hearers without
any thought of himself or of the effect he
is producing.
"â¢itie speaker should let nothing come
between himself and his audience. * He
should not exploit himself, and In so far
as he does he fails in effectiveness. The
moment he exploits himself that desire
comes between him and his audience.
"Words are instruments, each with its
special function, its definite purpose. If
we multiply our instruments beyond our
actual needs, confusion and complication
result. Simplicity, directness and clarity
are interfered with.
"Every verbal decoration is a barrier,
a disadvantage.
"In speech as in everything else the
straight line is the shortest 'distance be
tween two points. Every variation from .
it for the sake of the adornment of
speech makes it a longer way home.
"Any departure from the subject, any .
extraneous decoration used for the pur
pose of entertainment, to raise a laugh
or inject the personality of the speaker,
tends to weaken the effectiveness of the
was not bong tong to drag people out
the first night and that -.the bid would
surely come up smiling in the morning
mail. Here again Mrs. Toplofty had an
other overdue guess.
After she had waited the better part of
a year and had sent cards to all the
people whose names were in the Social
Register she came up against the con
clusion that there was a conspiracy on
foot to hide her light under a bushel.
She had even gone so far as to make a
desperate effort to call on some of . the
families that she thought ought to be
glad to know her, because she was sure
that the Toplofty-Joneses could buy and
sell them two or three times over with
out batting an eye. Strange to relate she
never seemed to be able to find them at
home. The. amount of time that city
people^ especially women, spend away
from home is one of the great curses of
American civilization,; there are a hunr
dred and seventy-six others, but we can't
recall their names at the present mo
ment.
Mr. Toplofty got tired of playing a lona
hand in a game where there was no
money UP about the third' week out and
stirred around to see if he couldn't make
a little trouble of his 'own. He soon
found that as long as he had < money of
his own to lose he could easily . find men
to help along the good work," and inside
of six weeks he had a regular chair In
a corner -of his; broker's office,' where he
could put his feet .on the . railing; .and
smoke brunette cigars, while 'the. ticker
ticked and the boy in the olue uniform
made curious marks' on .'the blackboard.

Mrs. Toplofty opened her campaign by

speech and in a degree toÂ« defeat its pur
"lt is for that reason that I never use
an anecdote. An anecdote may serve its
purpose to keep an audience in good hu
mor. It may renew waning interest In the
speaker, but as a rule it diverts attention
from the real purpose of the speechâ lt
makes It a longer way roundâ and I never
use one. \u25a0 â¢ {
"There are many speakers who do.' very
fine speakers, too; and no doubt an anec
dote; some times affords the very best
illustration, yet it Is more frequently a
diversion.
"An effective orator, one who can hold
his audience and convince them of his
sincerity, will never talk down to them.
That would be the act of a mountebank.
"I like to think that the people who
'come to hear me are the best people in
the world," and that they want my best.
It is only by giving the best" that is in
you* that you can satisfy yourself, or be
just to your audience. To talk down to
what you may" superciliously' consider
Nicholas Nemo
hair arid a dislike for clean collars,
coupled with, the ability to read poetry
that nobody understood in a way that
the poet himself couldn't have followed
with any great degree of success if he
had been among those present.
Then she inaugurated a schedule of
Sunday night teas, only she didn't call
them teas: oh. d*ear. no! She, called
them weekly salongs and let the In
formation gradually ooze out that the
very best brand of culture could be
had there at very reasonable rates.
Other people who were outside the cir-r
cle were inclined to call It the weekly
convention of the International Asso
ciation of Hammers, but that was be
cause they didn't know the true in
wardness of culture. According to the
views -expounded at the Toplofty sa
long. culture Is the ability to. see
something .where there isn't anything
in -particular an( j to do something that
nobody wants you to do and that
everybody . would much rather you
wouldn't.
- 'Every Sunday night they sat around
and heard Adolphus Fltzpoodle read
his sonnet to a scrub oak or listened
while -.Professor Tiripanny dragged , his
piano solo, commemorating the. death
of Sir Thomas Feline, out; of the baby

their intellectual level is an ir.su! t, aad it
stands between them and you. -It is a
barrier. It is a compliment a man may
pay himself to tell himself that the peo
ple who come to hear him are Intelligentâ
they wouldn't come, if they were not; and
I mean by that' that the coal heaver who
comes to hear me is as good as the col
lege professor. He may. in fact, listen
more carefully and I may be able to give
him more than the college professor, for
he doesn't come with the belief that hÂ» t
.knows it all. as the college man may
come. He is intelligent or he would have
no interest in coming, and he comes be
cause he Is interested and because I can
give him something which he wants and
has not.
"How about the education of an ora
tor?" I want to know.
"A man cannot have too much educa
tion to be an effective oratorâ nor too
little.
"It is only necessary that he shall have
something to say. and that he shall bo
sincere in saying it. If he knows his sub
ject, if.he has something to give the peo
ple which they have not. and tries hi:i
very best, simply and earnestly and di
rectly to do that one thing, he cannot
fail of being effective.
"But above all and before anything elao
he must \)e sincere. If he be that he need
not even be wise or sound.
"I have heard men advance views that
were the veriest nonsense and yet be elo
quentâbecause they were sincere.
"But the man who is ambitious to be
an orator . merely for the sake of ex
ploiting himself, because he desires to
be in the public eye, cannot be effective
because he cannot convince. His hear
ers see through him. He becomes merely
a performerâ a charlatan.
"I do not mean by this that all orators
Â»
who are not great, who do not possess ir
resistible eloquence, are charlatans. Far
from it. There are many such who do a
very useful work in politics or in moral
movements. They are men of slightly
wlder knowledge than their hearers. They
bring together fact 3 and different phases
of a question and present them to hearers
who would not otherwise get this large
view of affairs, and thus they work to a
very real, and useful purpose."'
"Of what use," I want to know, "is all
this oratory seething and bubbling
through a campaign â this verbal pyro
technics? Don't the newspapers"
"No," Mr. Cockran says, "the newspa
pers do not accomplish what oratory
dees; they do not take the place of the
orator.
"The newspaper editorial makes no
opinions, it merely confirms and supports
the odnions of those who read . It. A
man takes a paper because its views iu
incide with him. His own opinions ars
made up uninfluenced by the paper, anil
he takes the purer because it agrees
with him. Editorials do not form opin
ion; they voice the opinions formed.
"With the orator, on the contrary, lies
the power of forming opinion â and it i 3
a tremendous power. He has the ad
vantage over the printed word because
of the personal element in oratoryâ the
union that can be established between
speaker and hearers, and this power of
personality counts fur a great deal, to
attract or repel.
"The humblest man may become an
effective orator because of his sincerity
and the fact that he has something to
say. The most highly educated and
cultivated man may fail for want of
these things. But given sincerity and
something to say, the more a man
knows, the larger his knowledge and
understanding of life and affairs, the
greater will be his ability to convey
his thoughts to his hearers.*'
"Why," I snculd like to know, "why
Is a man an orator?"
"Because." explains Mr. Cockran
with the most amiable indulgence, "be
cause if you have opinions you should
express them, and, if you're afraid to
express them, you're ashamed of them

By and by it became known that Mri
Toplofty's salons was the only place in
town where real genius could be seen
in negligee, so to speak. Every mem
ber of the long haired tribe who cher
ished a grievance against the rest of
the human race for presuming to In
habit the 'same planet would make a
straight dash for Mrs. Toplofty'a as
soon as be got off the boat â or tha

soul and get into the game. As her
fame spread, the people who hadn't
been able to see her when she called

\ I*\ years In China and is now eta-
M"^ tioiied at Mukden. Manchuria, ar-
rived in Fan Francisco a few
dsys apo.
He has the business man's point of
view, having represented an American
mercantile txnnptiny In China before en
tering the Government service, and his
oi>tÃ" n on the vexed questions arising
fmni commerce with the Celestials is
worth wlille.*
There were a lot of questions 1 wanted
to ask him; questions about the introduc
tion of new lines of products, about the
extension of lines already established
more or less successfully, about the ex
ploitation of Manchuria, and, yes. about
tht Chinese boycott of American goods.
Do you know it has been hard to get
first-hand information about that dra
matic turn in the war of business?
Many :ocal firms had details from their
Chinese agencies, but they did not herald
them from the roof tops, and travelers
who returned from those shores were
vaju* and contradictory to a degreeâpar
ticulatly the official travelers.
They usually began by declining to talk
cf Ihe matter at all. proceeded directly
to the remark that the boycott bad never
rcr.lly existed and ended with the assur
ance that, any way, it wasn't effective.
Later, j'erhaps. they would tell us. confi
dentially and not at all for publication,
that it had been a bit awkward in certain
plr.cesâ only in certain places.
Whenever it reached this point I always
ashed the Washington-bound wanderer to
"tell me all fabout the war and what they
killed each other for." but he never
ucu'J.
Here was one exception, and because I
know you Trill be Interested in his Etory
I want to repeat it here and now.
fit begins many months back, when the
tal*s that were told of alleged Indignities
heaped upon Chinese in this country be
gun to take on a lurid tinge, as If the
journalism over there had felt the all too
univereal touch of tbe "yellow."
Readers of Chinese dailies were asked
to belkve that when their compatriots
wished to leave the United States af
ter a more cr less profitable eojourn, they
were under no circumstances allowed to
take v.-ith them any money nor other
property of whatever sort. All their
wealth, so the papers told, was seized by
a rapacious government In return for per
mission granted the Celestial to revisit
the land cf his birth. #
Another story was to the effect that
the hostility to Chinese ran so high In
certain localities It could be^ satisfied only
by crowding large numbers of them Into
Isolated buildings and destroying them by
fire.
Still another had to do with the in
vention of a wonderful new gun In Am
erica, a gun that for quickness and ac
curacy In action had never before been
equaled. It was tbe unvaried custom
of the officials, so the star}' ran, to test
11* efficiency by firing upon groups of
Chinese held In cages for that purpos*.
It will probably never be known.wheth
er these tales originated in the minds of
Chinese in this country or whether they
represent a subtle attempt on the part
cf tbe Ingenious Japanese to foment an
anti-American feeling that should clear
the Chinese and Manchurian markets cf
a strong competitor. Perhaps both in
fluences were at work and the occasional
reports In our newspapers of difficulties
experienced by Chinese tourists, students
and merchants In getting past the exclu
sion laws certainly did not have the ef
fect of soothing the discontent.
For the middle and high cast* Chines*
â¢re a proud and aristocratic people, a
fact w* too often overlook. They did
not take general exception to the laws
excluding the coolies, for they are per
haps as anxious as we that this class
should remain In their own country, but
when the better classes were subjected
to Indignity their pride of race was
Touched and they became anxious to re
taliate.
The commercial guilds throughout tha
empire had considered the form their re
venue should take end for come time
before July 19 they were ready to follow
the lead of any who should take the In
itiative. Many were timid. They did not
want to "be first."
Then the times brought forth the man
âTseng Ehao-ching. A native of Fuhklen
Province, he has long been a prominent
merchant In Shangh..-, where he Is Iden
tified with the Red Cross work and with
various educational movements to which
lie gives liberally cf his wealth. This po-
Eiilon among his fellows flatten his sense
of power and when the plan for exclud
ing American goods was waiting only for
a leader, he said. "I am brave enough. I
will <io it"
He l telegraphed to his connections In
other ports and trade centers, argumen
tative circulars were Issued by. tbe
Shanghai Guild, and the promptness with
lvhlvli the lid went on shows that the
merchants generally were, aa we used to
say when we were children, "good and
But, as was prophesied, the dealers
themselves were the heaviest losers, and
It is not of record that the Chinese wel
comes a cut in profits any more fervently
than does his brother of the Occident, no
matter how convinced he may be that he
has his quarrel just.
One merchant in a northern pt)rt had
placed an order for J2M.000 worth of
American cotton piecÂ« goods just before
the boyoott was declared and he was
very anxious to be released from the
contract, so anxious, Indeed, that he of
fered a liberal cash bonug to bring about
that result. The party of the second part
quite naturally declined to allow the can
cellation, when the merchant, though de
ploring his loss, maintained tnat he was
fighting for a principle and that as a pa
triot he was prepared for a sacrifice.
A little later, when the full realization
of his loss came home to him, he de
nounced the boycott with a round Eng
lish oath. He had advocated the use of
the two-edged weapon of business war
fare, but prayed for relief when he him
self felt Its cut.
His change of attitude is typical of the
majority, to whom President Roosevelt's
pronouncement regarding a possible mod
ification of our exclusion laws , by the
next Congress was more than' welcome as
giving warrant for at least a temporary
return to the old baEis of trade.
In - Illustration of the effectiveness of
the embargo, one story will suffice. The
Standard Oil Company, whose buslneÂ«Â«
in the Chinese empire In the first six
months of this year amounted to about
$5,000,000, sold not a case . of oil In Shang
hail (one of the two main ports and dis
tributing points) from July 20 until Sep
tember 14. On this latter date, as I am
told, an order was given in the open mar
ket for between 43,000 and 50,000 cases.
Other commodities felt the release as.
promptly and a fairly good trade in all
established lines Is anticipated for the
next few months.
A recent consular report indicates an
exportation of cottons from the' United
States to China during the first seven
months of this year of the value of $19.
000.000, and I mentioned this to Mr. Che
shire with a question as to whether it
does not tend to disprove tbe charge of
general unsuitability brought against
American goods in that market.
"On the contrary," he replies. "All or
nearly all the cotton cloth, sheetings,
drill and print sold by our manufacturers
go Into Northern China, where the people
need a weight and quality similar to the
stock prepared for American markets.
Every Chinaman needs cotton cloth. It is
the chief and often the only material
used in his clothing, for only the well-to
do can afford silk or silk mixtures. He is
a shrewd buyer; he has to be, for the
margin between his income and his im
perative necessities is very narrow, when
there Is any margin at all. and his par
tiality for American cottons is founded on
his knowledge that Lhey suit his needs
and are a better value than other cloth
of the same price.
"But the Southern Chinese needs
quite as much cotton cloth as .the
Northern, yet he will have, none of
ours. The millions of people represent
an enormous market, but Americans
are not sharing: in Its profits. Why?
Because the regular lines of cotton
cloth made in this country do notsult
him either in weight -or texture, "and
our manufacturers will not issue new
brands that will be acceptable. '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0
"Probably the most widely â¢ known
characteristic .of the Chinese lis their
conservatism In taking' up new ideas
yet that Vtery thing Is apparently con
sidered not at all by the merchants v
who seek to do business with them. ' ". *
"Attempts to sell them what they do
not want and do not need are,respon
sible for many failures or vague suc
cesses co long: deferred as to make both "
the heart and the 'treasury sick, and
not a few firms have thus been led to ;
renounce all plan of campaign in China
as entirely profitless." .
"What is the right way to pro-i
?Â£ c ? r ,, 1 asked> for v appeared to me*
that all x>ur regular business methods
must be reversed.'
"The two firms most conspicuously
BUccesÃful there arc the Standard Oil
Company and the British-American
Tobacco Company. ; They give the peo- *
pie Just what they want in- Just the
style of case or package required and
under a cnop or- i:auo-mark that Is
never varied. ..Their local- managers â
Chinese-speaking Americansâ -are as
sisted by staffs of English-speaking
natives, who have charge of the direct
"dealing with the people. The average
American drummer Is out of place in
\u25a0China; He cannot meet the biggest
Â£ merchants, he cannot get in touch with'
the market, and he goes .away little
wiser and quite a bit poorer than when
he came. .
I "I have mentioned the'ehop or trade
mark and its Importance In the Chi
nest* mind," -and to sh6w-' how '-other:
countries appreciate this I can , tell
you that Russian.- and!. German dealers
have imitated some American products,
reproducing the color. and kind of pa
per used In' wrapping, the kind of cord
and the number of loops used; in tying
the packages and the figure or! sign
stamped on them. All these' trifles are
as essential to the -Oriental, buyer as
quality or price. .
"A number of American firms are
represented- on a:, commission basis by:
other agencies, notably British, the re-,
suit being that England gets the bene--;
Jit in reputation for all the i- business J
done, and the "further result that ; the

"In illustration.of the importance of .,

can.referrto .'a, matter? that came under

It will be remembered by the.commer

Havre returned from an e~xt ended trip
through the. Orient, several months age,
he submitted a report of attempt-d dupli

Mr. Herbert Furlong, who is in charge â¢
of the Pacific Commercial Museum and
concerned in exploiting Eastern and
South American markets for California
business bouses, told rue of the position
taken by one manufacturer en the mat
ter of conforming to the Tar Easterner's .
requirements. * -
Thl3 was on a question of soap, cheap
soap, a soap Inferior in quality and green
of color.
The museum's representative had stated
most explicitly what was wanted, sand
ing a sample and a memorandum
ot price. Ho thought the same thing
could be made In America for less and
Mr. Furlong and the manufacturer
thought so too.
"It Is a mighty poor article." said the
manufacturer. "I don't see how they can
use it at all. I can give them a. bet
ter soap than that for less money."
"Yes, , but they don't want It. Thay
want that soap." urged Mr. Furlon*.
"Then they're- fools."
This., was the only conclusion the Amer
ican business man could arrive at, and It
satisfied himself at least. Do you Â«u>
pese he made an effort to get the order?
Not he! He declined to have any pert
in the attempt of-a set of peopto reason
ins so obliquely, to attain to that estate
\u25a0which is. In the Western world, next to
godliness.
A ; similar disinclination to meet the
needs of a given market Is shown by tit*
manufacturers of cheaper sorts o? ready
made clothing, and though It does not
have to do with China it Is Interesting
as" illustrating a general attitude. " i
There would be a great demand for
clothing 1 of thl3 sort In Central and
South America bnt for the fact of a. Tm
v rying standard Â«of physical development.
To realize these Southrons' Idea, of "a
perfect flit" the trousers of a given â¢!*Â»
should be a little longer and tha coast
or Jumpers a little shorter tlian they are
made for our own Americans.
So far, our manufacturers have, practi
cally refused to modify their models, and
it remains for the New World Latins to
remold themselves nearer to our desire
or secure their clothing from firm* in
ether countries, where there is a morÂ«Â«^
elastic conception of the human form Cl
vine. The first of these alternatives is
not impossible of achievement la this
twentieth century., but the chances, are
that the second will continue to be fol
lowed as representing the line of least
resistance. *
Notwithstanding the difficulties that at
tend the establishment of profitable trada
connection with China, many of our San
Francisco firms have such connections,
and while not all are satisfied with the
records made, they are looking to the fu
ture for the lajrger profits. "As ' one ex
porter said to me. "Once we can make
ourselves known there It will be q'uflo
as hard for another country to oust us
as it ha 3 been for us to take thÂ« place of
English and German flrms who had thÂ«s
advantage of an early start." .

Things have ton;e to a strange pass
wh.cn you put en your winter furs in
thÂ«- wiiimer time, yet this has long been
the style in Paris, and the. custom is
gradually crÂ«Â«p{as over to this country.
* It secn:s a pity, the French say. to
s?on& so much money upon your fur,*
and tlicn to put them away. "My. muff
and Â»>ca <:o:l ??Â©00." Â«>.iid a French "so
ciety woman; "why should J. conceal it
in camphor for two-thirds of the year?"
This 18 the custom nrarly all over
â¢the Continent. Furs are bought and
k'-pt in good order to wear all the year
around. â¢ In \u25a0 the winter time they are
donned with a heavy suit and in the
savtmer they arc worn with lighter
wrap*. It is wholly a Question of cusr
tonY U;ls matter of wearing tura. aad
wouiÂ«'ii who own haudsome fur gar
ment* ftÂ«l that they have really no
riplit ?o dcrrlv* themselves of these
articles throussh so many months of the
year. J
And that is why. If you go to^enox
these fall days. or' to the. White Moun
tain- or to high resorts anywiierc m
t ' hc West, you will see the women
dressed In sable. They are wearing:
beautiful gowns, which still have a
touch of summer about them, for the
Cays ure warm at. noontime, but around
the shoulders there Is throw* ... fur
Â«pc or a deep collarette, or one of the
"^r. flat boas of the season.
The Newport leaders who bought
their' abroad this year have
brouehUback with them some beautiful
articles. And of -all the, beautiful fur
clece* there Is none more remarkable
pieces mÂ«
than toe new 'neck furs. These. axe
varied and beautiful, sind they are
made of a great variety of materials.
It is the style, of 'course, to Wear old
furs,' and women -.who have; heirlooms
are proud to bring them out year after
year and to wear them on occasion,
but it is very nice to own a. set of
'up-to-date furs, and that is the reason ;
why women of- fashion who can afford
the rooney are prone to invest year
after year in . the latest new articles
in this line. They pride' themselves , on
a. fur collection just as they do on a
string: of pearJs.
Count ing: the Cost.
"What does a set of furs cost?" is
the flrst auestion a woman asks when
she starts out to buy: and well may.
she consider the question, of price, for
it is the ruling one where furs are.
concerned. The truth of the matter is
that furs are ridiculously *- high, and -
they do not seem inclined to come down
in price. You can clothe your lingers in
diamonds for a less cost than you can
dress your neck in furs, and you can
buy a diamond dog collar for just about
the same price which a real handsome
coat and muff will cost you. Never
were fÂ«irs so dear. But. on the other
hand, they were never so nice, and
never so becoming; never so fashion
able and uevcr so desirable
Of course, there is a grain of conso
lation for the woman of limited purse In
tne fact that fur Imitations can be picked
out very cheaply; and, as these^ are pret
tiiy made and nicely executed through
out; they will answer every purpose. If
ehc does not want to buy fur imitations
she can buy " real furs of the cheaper
grade, and thece, with a few nice pieces
to help out on state > 'occasions.'., will carry
her very well through the winter. But
she must not attempt to get through
the geason entirely without furs of any
kind. This is a very : serious mistake
in dress.; v .

perhaps it mignt oe said .that they are
different from the boas . of previous sea
sons. The majority of them are flat and.
are lined with eatin. They are about eight,'
inches wide and hang far down the front.

There is one pretty thing, about furs %
this season, and that is that they are
lined in very artistic' fashion. The style
is to match the silk : to the fur. and'. to
make it harmonize as well as possible â¢
in every way. For instance, 'gray squir

FIJHS FOR FAT WOMEN.
The boa for a Stout womanis made
flat and father wide. It Is lined with
satin, but it is as thin as possible,- so
that it docs not make the neck heavy."
ilni In front it is fastened with a handsome
jeweled clasp and the ends, which are
wide and pointed, do not come quite to
the waist line. With this the stout
woman: carries a large thin flat ; muff
shaped* something 'like a ! pillow," al
though it. is by no means a heavy muff.
In. her : h:it she -.wears-, "a" fur ornament,
which' cau 1 be a fur -rosette or] a bunch
of -tails,^ JTtÂ« foot of her skirt can be
tritamed --with Z two narrow bands ' of
fur; and 'she. can "carry; a fur "bag ypon
her arm. In this way she contrives to
be well dressed, in winter furs.
Do" not" think/ because you* purchase
small articles of fur. that you are ne
cessarily buying cheaply. Many of the
tiny little fur bits such as cuffs, col
lurs, -fur~ban"ds and rosettes cost $20 or
more, . md you can'reudliy fritter away
a courle of hundred dollars without
knowing it.. Perhaps, after "all, fritter
is the wrong word to use, for money 13
never wasted that is spent on furs.
They will be good year after year, and
you can wear tkem forever . and will
them away afterward. -
There is a very* fashionable woman in
New Ycrk and Chicago society. who raake3
it a point to add to her fur collection every
winter. At Christmas time her husband
and her children make her presents of
pieces of fur, and so it is that she has
accumulated . many handsome articles..
This winter she has selected a coaf of
sable, which- will cost $1000. It ils
long haired, with- silver, tips. The coat,
which comes "only to the hips, ia fitted
in the back and loose In the front, in
military fashion. It ' is single-breasted
and is buttoned with Immense silver,
monogram buttons.' To go v/ith this there
Is to be a large pillow muff, very wide
and quite fiat, and there will be a small
fur collar which clasps in front and
which can bo easily removed.
The woman who is not prepared to pay
a thousand dollars for a sable coat can
get along "very nicely with a ;clotb
coal lined with fur, for fur lining 3 are
toba quite the rage this year. A hand*
some : " black - broadcloth coat lined with
chinchilla makes as pretty a garment as
one would want to possess, and. what is
b~C4tfof all about il, there is the mark of.
fashionable approval stamped upon it.
; '~.\Ve;have almost come back to the ftÂ»r
lined circular, and women who once
owntd.a fur-lined garment of this kind
can get it out and wear it with very
few alterations. One of the most fashion
able 'new capes of the year was once an
\u25a0old: fur-lined circular. It Is cut down a
little, so that it is not quite so long, and
it is trimmed with fur on the outside.
There . are other ways to utilize the old
fur circular and ono of these is to make
it into a coat three-quarter length, with
'long loose coat sleeves and a' wide flare
around the wrist. Such a coat is very
becoming to any woman and if worn
with a big new-fashioned muff it 13 im
mensely smart.
hats made: of fou.
Dozens and dozens of hats are made
of fur this year. They are either all
fur, or are fur trimmed, and, perhaps
of the two, the latter Is the more satis
factory, for it is lighter and one does
not tire of it ao soon! A gray squirrel
of a grayish blue shade was made upon,
the model of a polo hat. It was coy- v
cred with the squirred on top and
around the s*ides. It was like a polo
even to the small feather ornament
which stood upright at the side. An
other hat of the same fur was built on
the lines of an English walking hat;
and still another was. modeled after a
Fedora.
To .'trim these fur hats one can take
a bow of velvet ribbon, l or a* plume, or
one can use the big jeweled ornaments
which are fashionable this year/ There
are ever so many trimmings available,
and, indeed^ the fur hat can be decor
ated with anything that could have
been used. upon a felt hat. /

and the other day a clever girl came
out in a suit which orfu could not but
admire for its ingenuity, even though
it had rAÂ»,t been so pretty.
The suit was built of rough cloth in
a shade of sliver gray. Although of a
delicate hue it would shed the dust
nicely, and. of course, it could be col
ored some day. -With this suit there
was a flat" mult of imitation ermine,
that fur which is Imitated so well, and
there was also it bou which was short,
flat and rounding upon the end 3. Her
hat was a peculiar silver gray felt, very
rough, and almost woolly in its texture.
Around the edge there was a very nar
row rim of ermine, and, at the side,
there were tw.o plumes. Tbi3,was not
an. expensive suit, yet it w<f3 an ex
tremely handsome one.
It is difficult to state what are the
most fashionable furs of the winter,
for Dame Fashion lays down no rule
for her followers; she simply asks that
they dress in good taste. Silver tipped
sable perhaps comes flrst if one Is not
going to consider the price, though
otter, seal, ermine, mink and Persian
lamb come very close to It; then theje
are the cheaper furs and the novelties,
of which one must not forget pony
skin and calf." both of which are to be
much worn this winter.
NOVELTIES IX KUaS.
â¢ The novelty furs are very attractive,
but they are scarcely advisable for the
woman who is going to wear them a
long time, for they may go out of data.
A calfskin, with the hair upon It, in
red with big wandering marks of whits
â just like a barnyard calf â was mads
into a handsome coat which was worn
with a golden brown dress. A flat calf
muff was very pretty.
The fur touts are buttoned with
braided loops, and they are buttoned
with bllf. handsome buttons. If ono
does not want the buttons visible one
can button the coat under a flap and
trim the opening with a handsome fas
tening in fancy braid, and there come
gorgeous braids for just such purpose.
Again one can button a silk coat with,
big fur buttons, and it is very fash
ionable to cover button molds with fur,
and to work little figures on each mold.
just as though one were working 1 on
velvet or, silk. These big buttons make
a trimming all by themselves and they
wonderfully dresa up an old coat which
has well-nigh outlived Its usefulness.
Novelty is quite essential if one Is
going to look In style, and one can best
manage this novel effect by securing
something new in the shape of a neck
trimming. - One lovely collarette wÂ«
trimmed on the ends .with fur rosettes:
another had fur flowers cut out anl
applied; still another was trimmed with
a design in braid put on in awlrls; an
other had Its ends trimmed with bands
of braid.
All suggestions are useful when onÂ«
Is fixing up an old collarette, for any
woman who undertakes the task will
see how easily It Is to do it well. Tho
wide fur girdles arc- to be very much
worn and also the wide fur stocks.
Don't attempt to get through the
winter with no furs, for their lack will
stamp you as being a woman of no
taste whatever. Furs are distinctly the
mark of winter, and she who neglects
this opportunity to change her appear
anew makes a vÂ«ry grave mistake. /

The man nodded his head. He
looked tired and dusty. "You expeot

"Yep. Your old man wrote me. Did
you walk? What, all the way?"
The other assented. "Any money?"
queried Sutcliffe. -â¢!"
"None," said the other, "except just
enough to feed on the way. The law

Sutcliffe pulled out a roll of bills and
peeled off two. "Take it." he said; "a

â¢"When did he go up State?" he con
tinued.
"Who? Father? Two days ago â in

"Fourteen year's a long time," sighed
Butcllffe. "I was in for six. That's

afterward. Not a word now. You eat
an' I'll smoke."
The one ate, the other smoked in
silence. Sutcliffe gazed long and ear
nestly on the young man's countenance.
He was not a bad looking fellow.
Young â about 25. Good square Jaw
and a nose that stood out in the air.
Good eyes, but a bit too much shrewd
ness in them. But stamped upon him.
though only In a slight degree, was
that etrange, indefinable expression of
face and manner that was stamped to
srn extent much greater upon Sutcllffe
and upon all men of that ilk â the In
nate individuality of crime.
"His face is a fortune to us," thought
Sutcliffe. "He's the very man â the very
man, Dawson," he said aloud, as the
other concluded his meal, "I want to
tell you something â something I've
been thinking about for a lonj/ time.
Now, see here, you're in this business
to stay. I suppose you've about made
up your mind to that. Lord, when I
think of your father before you and
your grandfather before you! Your
family's a credit to you, young fellow.
Jet" me tell you that.
"Xov. look here." he continued. "I'm go
in' to stake you for all you're worth, an"
you'll find out before I get through just
how I'm coin* to do it. The big thing,
Pawson, in our business, as you know, is
to get the confidence of the people. It's
a great business, but that's the greatest
par^t of it. Once get their confidence, and
the rest is dead easy. Now, look at me.
No man ever caw me dressed up in my
life. Rough clothes, rough voice and rough
manner. That's me. An' what's more, I
always had a shave the day before yes
terday. Why. if I wexit into a man's of
fice the first thing he'd think was that 1
was a tr^mp. In five minutes he'd begin
to understand that I dSdn't care much
Â«hat he thought. Say, in a week that
man 'd be pretty sure that I was a mil
lionaire mine owner or a cattle king from
the West. I looked it, I tell you, and
acted it. And there wasn't a time when
I was after big gameâ that I couldn't put
my hand in my pants pocket and pull
out a roll like this, if necessary. Say, in
another week that man 'd be runnin'
after me. seekin' my favor, 'stead of me
seekin' his. When I got to that stage of
the game, you can place your bottom
dollar, Dawson, I could do business with
him to my own satisfaction and have it
all my own way. *ln a couple more weeks
or so I had him cleaned out, an' he knew
it. Those were my methods, Dawson, and
there wasn't a man before me that ever
thought of playing the game as I played
it. And those methodsâ say. where they
failed once they won twice. Why, say,
you've heard about some of them. Look
at that Burlingame affair an' the way I
did young Stevenson. You heard p* them."
He :>uffed fo/- a minute or two In si
lence. "But I tell you, young John, I'm
out of it. They're on to my methods, and
they're onto me, 'specially since I went
up. Say, there isn't a dodge from Maine
to Texas where I wouldn't be spottedâ
that is. In anything worth while. But
say. there was a time when I would
spend as long as a year, or two years
even, just layin' the foundation to get
into a man's confidence. I did that with
old Bently, an* after all I only got about
four thousand out o" him. Still it was
money. But I been thlnkin' your, father
an' me made a mistake. Sometimes we'd
make a strike, but never over five figures,
and generally only about three."
He laid down his pipe and touched the
other on the arm. "What I ought to have
done in the past, and what I intend to do
in the future, Dawson," he said impres
sively, "is to deal with nothin' less than
six figures. I'm goin' to make a big strike
or bust, an' ten to one on it I don't bust,
either. Look a here." He spread some
newspaper clippings on the table. "Here's
a fellow got away with over seven hun
dred thousand dollarsâ you understandâ
seven hundred thousand. Here's another
got . $350,000. Another J42s.OoOâ an' so they
go. You know who these fellows are as
well as I doâ they're bank cashiers. But,
see here, "did any o' these fellows actually
get away? No, indeed. Here; this fel
low was caughtâ and thisâ and this. Say,
do you think they'd ever catch me â¢ with
$700,000? You know they couldn't. And
where's the money these fellows took?
Gone â long before they skipped. They'd
been takin' it in driblets, long before
they went. When they come out they
got nothing to show for It. No, wait a
minute, Daweon," he continued. "What's
the thing that makes it possible for these
fellows to steal and steal and steal for
years? What Is It? Why, It's because
they got tKc confidence of every moth
er's son in the \u25a0â¢ bank an' in the com
munity, an' that's' what It Is. That's the
thing. An' why don't they get away
with the stuff? I'll tell you why. It's
because they're . fools instead of being
knaves â that's all. Now d'ye see what
I'm drivin' at? Put a man like you or
me In a position 'where we've got the
confidence of everybouy â everybody, un
derstandâand say, when the time comes
to get away with^ a" few hundred thou
sand, d'ye* think they'd get us? But to
do that thing a man's got to make a
reputation, -an* It takes years to make it.
"Dawson,". he said, as he drew his chair
nearer, "it'll be ten years afore your old
man gets out. - I'm goin' to sit down an'
wait tor him.' I got about sixteen thou
sand saved out o' that last thingâ the
one I went up forâ an' I'm goln' to wait,

an interval of five minutes. "I guess he
can have them. Don't sell him any
more, though, unless you see me
about it."
Of course, nobody but the people that
Dawson dealt with ever bothered about
him. He went on, slowly at first, as
was natural. \u25a0. \ . \u25a0,_
"You don't borrow enough money,"
said Sutcliffe, at the end of the Jirst
three months, "and buy more goods on
credit."
"But." said the younger, "I don't need
the money, and I don't want the goods."
"Never you mind," said Sutcllffe.
"What you want to do is to borrow.
Borrow it and put it in the bank, an'
then pay it back. Give your note. Let
your paper float around. And people'll
begin to know you. That* what you
want. But always pay when due. Be
sure about that. As for goods, I've
found a way to create a demand for
those. Tou go and see the Mayor an'
ask him for some email orders from the
town. The man that he'll refer you to
Will give you an order. See if he don't."
Sutcliffe was right. Whenever Dawson
law that man he got the order. The man
himself didn't know why, but his imme
diate superior did. And Dawson didn't
care why, ao long as the order came in.
Five years later John Dawson stepped
Into the office of the president of the First
National.
"How are you. Alderman ?** aa'.d the
latter cordially. "What can I do for you?
What is it now. eh?"
"Mr. Breslin," said John Dawson, "I
want to enlarge my place over here Â»Ull
more, but this architectural business I've
got takes a good deal of mocey. I need
Just about $13,000 for ninety days. The
question Is, can you let me have it?"
"Dawson, there isn't a man in town
that we'd sooner lend $13,000, or any
amount of money, to than to you. Of
course, you can have if*
"I didn't know," replied Dawaon uncer-
tainly.
It was the eighth year of the compact
between Sutcliffe and Dawson, and in thÂ»
year of our Lord 13â.
It was in the fall of the year, and thÂ«
town of Monroe was in the throes ol*-*^

"Gentlemenâ fellow citizens," shouted
the chairman of the meeting in the Town

"Hooray!" yelled Sutcllffe with the
crowd.
"I say, is there one? â in the whole

"No! No! No!" yelled the crowd.
And "No! No! No!" yelled Suteliffe.

the chairman, "It is my privilege, and

"Hl!' HI! HI! 'Ray! *Ray! 'Ray!'
yelled the crowd.
"Three cheers for the Honest Man!"
yelled SutcllfCe. and pandemonium
broke loose. .
"Two more years." said Sutcllffe &?%
himself that night. "Two years more.
And then â "
The city of Monroe was upon the
-top wave of prosperity. It had wak
ened up from a conservative business
town of the old style Into a great city
of . modern enterprise. , New publlo .
buildings were being built, publlo
parks were being laid out. bonds were
being issued. Enormous sums of money
were being poured into the city's treas
ury, more than ever before: far beyond
the amount of the treasurer's bond.
The money was lying there to meet
the vast public Improvements that were
being made.
"It's a good thing." the people said,
"that we've got John Dawson in. ohargs
of all that pile. He's honest as the* day
Is long. He's the right man. In the
right place. That's clearl"
"Dawson," said Sutcliffe, "in three
months' time the old man'll be out â In
three months. I've got everything â
everything, mind, down to the small
est detail â arranged and In order. We'll
leave on a Saturday night for you know
where, and that'll give us thirty-six
hours' start.' Hell Itself can't catch us
with that start. Now, as far as you're
concerned. In three months* time â I've
estimated that in about three months
from now you can lay your hands on
something over $250,000."
"Sutcllffe," said Dawson, with a grim
\u25a0mile, "in .three months from now I can
lay hand on $300,000, and not & cer.r/.
less."
. "By George!" said Sutcliffe with a
fierce Joy. "By George! we've struck It.
I didn't think you had It In you, Daw
son." he said with a glance of admira
tion. "Honest, now, I: didn't."
Three months later Sutcliffe. the
swindler, sat waiting in the little room
behind the bar at Steven O'Donnell's.
He raised his head. A man stood in
the doorway.
"Here at last. Honest John Dawson."
he exclaimed. "I've been a-waitin' for
you. Come in. Have you got It?"
"I have,", said , Dawson as he laid
down a -bulky package on the table.
He remained standing. Suddenly be
addressed the other man.
"Sutcliffe." he said earnestly, ;Â«look
here, I can't do this thing. I've got to
back out. There Isn't a man. woman or
child in Monroe that doesn't trust me
to the end I know."- he said simply,
"that It Isn't right or fair to you to take

I can't, so help me God!*!.
The elder man stood silent for an in
stant; thqn he stretched out his hand.
"Shake!" ha exclaimed..
"John Dawson." he \- said huskily,
"there's more than that to it. and. U'd
just this: You've. made an honest man

Office Worll
for Girls
yr >Â«t Â«\ HEN a young girl casts about
\A I for some line of work by
V V which she may gain a liveli
hood, three great avenues
for self-support present themselves
to her. They are: Housework, of
fice work and school teaching.
Finally she chooses office work because
only a comparatively short period of
preparation is necessary for the work and
a liigh standard of schooling is not al
ways required. If the young girl has the
advantage of a good business school
training she may hope to "rise" to a
good salary and responsible position if
she can make her employer feel that she
Is of value to lWm. -In addition to the ad
vantage of short preparation and the hope
of rising the oflice woman linds herself in
close touch with other workers and 'in
some cases, as in law offices, she is as
bociated with men of affairs and these
two elements of interest broaden her view
of life
. The disadvantages she finds are numer
ous in office work as in all lines of ac
tivity. She is surrounded" by temptations,
some of them serious in their nature,
and which when tired and weary from
long continued work are hard to lesist.
Her companions are at times undesirable
and uncongenial, and < ly the necessity
of earning her dally bread -keeps* her at
a {ask -which is barren or pleasure. The
struggle to live on the meager salary,
to dress ,hei*elfv well, as/she- must,- and
to pay her carfare, lunches niid'-board,
tax her powers of economy, unless.'. she is
fortunate enough to" live at home and
be responsible only, for nerself.- Speed,
accuracy, alertness and a goo"d memory
are the qualifications required for office
work. Much unpleasantness -is avoided
if the girl is careful to make no mistakes
in her part of the work, and.it is seldom
that good honest ste^y work goes un
appreciated.- She takes dictation in
shorthand In the smaller offices, while
in the larger ones the phonograph ia
! being used more and more, "being turned
on" to the epced at which she types on
the machine. This obviates part of the
business training, but a girl can ill af
ford not to know shorthand if she is to
reach the hope of many of having a. little
office of her own, independent and em-,
ploying others to help. Another Impor
tant duty Is -the filing of letters, "a task
that requires much care and is harder
work than a casual looker on would
Imigine. Mistakes in this are costly and
\u25a0 more than "one woman baslost'her posi
Â§tioa through carelessness. ' ' ' â¢
There ia a pleasant side to her .busi
ness life in the office if the woman has
as an employer a considerate and gen
tlemanly man, for where three or .. four
people all work together in one rooom,
and where outsiders are constantly com
ing in on business, if the employer is
not all he should be the position of the
stenographer may be mafle very trying.
And an employer has a power over , his
employes to make or mar their business

The" advice of tfie tried business
K'Vomen, "Keep yourself to yourself, do
your work neatly and to the best of
your ability, be prompt and courteous in
all your dealings and in business have
only business relations," has helped
many a zirl along. '
"Where is the bright, pretty girl who
had charge of the desk near the door."
I asked a business man of my acquaint
ance lately. "She did not realize that
this business is not a social function,"
he answered, smiling; "we have no time
to train a young girl in these matters.
She must avoid any and all social con
versation In an office or make room for a
woman who has learned self-restraint to
that extent."
"These girls, you , notice, are almost
without exception well dressed," said a
woman at the head of a noonday rest
club in Chicago, who is making a special
study of the work and' lives of office wo
Â« men, and who is doing a great deal to
make their lives brlchter and easier.
"They are alert, self-reliant, and some are
ambitious not only to do their daily work
well, but many are doing work entirely
apart from the office. One of the girls
here has a voice of rare quality. All her
leisure moments are spent in practicing;
her only pleasure is her Saturday after
noon lesson and an occasional concert and
jjopera. Her income as a stenographer is
$20 per week; one-half of this she gives
to her mother as her share of the family
expenses; with the other ten she is doing
what she can to live and train her voice.
Many live very meagerly In order to help
in the family expenses. In some cases
they bear the burden of supporting the
family alone and they never flinch in the
work they have undertaken in spite of
every discouragement."
After all Is said in favor of one or oÂ£
another means of self-support for women,
arc we not all looking forward to a solu
tion of thfl economic problems of our
strenuous times which force women out
into the world to tight for the right to livo
against greater odds than their brothers
have (o face? Does not the new time
coming promise relief from overwork and
underpay for Us women? "Does not -the
twentieth century call to women? "From
the factory and office and stuffy school
room, I will call my daughters back to

grandmothers; but* to a home freed by

Woman Who Toils and Reason for Toiling

hundn-ds of centuries? Strange, indeed,
that the world should have been blind
so long, or perhaps It -is true "that

she works by the sweat of her brow to
earn her daily bread. '

Teacher
PEOPLE used to believe ' that the
hand that rocks the cradle rules
the world. We know that' this 'is
a poetic generalization which,
,'â¢ like most . vagUe half truths,, ia
worse than' a lie. Mothers, we know,
do not rule the world, neither directly
nor indirectly. If mothers or women
ruled the worlds the horrors of corpse
strewn, bloodsoaked battlefields with
their writhing, mangled men praying
their comrades for the stroke of mercy
which would , end their 'misery would
not be possible. The hand that rocks
the cradle does not rule the world.
Commercialism rules the world. \u25a0 The
spirit .of barter and of* exploitation of
new countries anil of new : peoplesâ
this is the ruling, spirit of the world
which is best expressed in modern lifo
by the. spirit of aggression as typified
in the commercial development of the
United States. ' :
This commercial development has set
our economic conditions on end. , We
don't know whero we are at. Old peo

much better." They see that the home
is deserted where once .mother
could always be found baking, brewing
or spinning or teaching her | children.

all women r who work without pay
\u25a0\u25a0'. are put in the. same class with in- \u25a0

of this country have a gainful pursuit
and what the proportion is of- those en
gaged in artistic and literary/work it is
difficult to say. The number is" \u2666large,
however, and In some of these lines It is
increasing. The art and crafts move
ment with s the revival of the handicraft
and "the chance.' for, .the , development of
original ideas in silver, copper and jewels
has brought to the front many women
who would otherwise have been unknown
and whose- talent woulcr have been
wasted. The Arts arid Crafts societies as
they now exist in the different cities em
ploy skilled artists who are also wage
earners. It is estimated that about 83
per cent of the. pupils in the schools of
.industrial' art*- are women and that some
10 per cent of. them; support themselves
by their work. Tho greater proportion
of women who enter these schools do it
\u25a0 with the avowed purpose of . supporting
themselves afterward as designers, for
furniture, \u25a0wall "paper, silks, summer
goods, silverware and book covers.

Law and the
Lady To-Day
IN the days of the : Roman emplnj
women were allowed to have their
clients and arguo their, cases before
the high" bench of justice until one
woman, keener and more learned
than the rest, put the Roman Judges to
naught and placed the whole legal sys
tem at her mercy. This action on the
part of a woman was more than, the
stern, dignified Roman bench could stand
and after a long debate oiifthe right of
a woman to be a lawyer the bepch met
in secret session and voted unanimously
that from - lat time forth no woman
should be allowed to study, or practice
law within- the boundaries of the Ro
man empire upon pain or instant death.
- 'The, decree of the Senate seems to
' have effectually put a stop to woman's
legal aspirations for somo time. ; Now
and then through history one is found
able and willing to defend a right before
a court of law, but it Â«Â» mostly as an
international lawmaker In the office of
the power bemnd the throne that woman
has used her power.
The worthy Roman Senator would look
with dismay and pity upon Americans
were he here to-day, for all over this
wide country trained women lawyers are
fighting and upholding the Interests of
women.
The pioneers in this branch of learning
did their work as a rule to be companions
for their husbands, and having mastered
the profession and being competent to
act, the subject was first brought before
the. bar of Illinois as to whether or not
woman was entitled to practice provided
she was competent. The fight for recog
nition was practically carried through by
one woman, who finally succeeded in hav
ing the law made allowing women to
study and practice law in that State.
In common law a woman has no right
.to practice before, a court, so that in
every State whero she has been admitted
to the bar the same struggle has had to
be gone through with.
In 1579 Mrs. Lockwood of Washington.
D. C, drafted a bill and secured Its pas
sage through Congress providing that
"any woman who shall have been a mem
ber of the. bar of the highest court of
the District of Columbia for the space of
three years and shall ' have maintained
a good" standing before such court, and
who shall be a person of good moral char
acter, shall, on motion,, and the produc
tion of such record be admitted to prac
tice before the Supreme Court of the
United States."
Tho passage of this bill practically es
tablished the status of the woman law
yer. The laws of each State have been
amended to allow her the position of
attorney. Schools have been opened to
her and offices established in which tho
master mind is that of a woman.
The social standing of a lawyer Is rec-
ognized.'and the legal profession was one
of ; the first â¢to \u25a0 open its ranks and wel
come the newcomer ; but until tshe has
civic recognition and can hold office
there Us a check upon" the ambitions or
at' least^ the iKJssibllities" of the woman

book on women and : thÂ« law by the aU

Nursing as a
Profession
C^TsO feed the hungry, clothe the poor
I and tend to the sick sums up In
I "many a good person's mind the
| total obligation of a woman to
society outside her home. The
feeding of the hungry and the ctothlng of
the poor has been systematized to a large
extent and placed in the hands of spe
cially appointed committees of church'
and club and relief-giving societies. The
old nurse, the inheritor of a secret art.
self-taught, who knew where each herb
and root grew and. tho value of each as a
particular remedy, has passed away with,
the Lady Bountiful, and in her ptac*
stands the . alert, competent, hospital
trained woman, immaculate ia her striped
uniform.
: The trained nurse has a field of work
as broad as the needs of a sick human
ity, and ta her credit, be it said, she is
using every opportunity which comes her
way. She is recruited from every class
of society, and in her four years* train
ing in the hospital lays the broad founda
tion for future specialized work. Her
training is severe. Before she is admitted
to the regular nurses' staff she has to
serve three or zlx months' probation that
fitness and endurance may be tested, and
her own decision confirmed that the woric
she has chosen is the right one for her.
Then follows the three or four years"
course: different kinds of work by flay
or by nightâ the contagious ward with its
fever cases, the surgical ward and the
operating-room, clinics and the regular
study, with recitations, which goes on all
the time. Throughout all Is the life In the
nurses' house, with its frolics and spree's,
which are Inevitable wherever a number
of young, strong' girl3 live together. The
doors of the hospital closed behind them,
they pass out into their work, their pins
and their diplomas in their hands.
All the graduates Uo not undertake
private practice, though that Is the
mecca of most of the undergraduates.
The pay Is good, the work hard and thÂ»

are unable to afford a nurse and who

life is a strenuous one, out In all weath
ers, into every kind of a human habita
tion and among every kind of people,
never knowing what she will find the.

of Incident and variety. In which the

skirts of humanity.
Closely allied In motive with these as.
sociatlons la the Nurses* Settlement,
where, under the leadership of a noble
woman, several * nurses live together
and work for a common object among
their poorer neighbors and friends.
Besides private and charitable nurslnÂ«r
there Is the growing opportunity in
the State and county Institutions for
the skilled nurse. The trend Is to sup
plement all ward work with .women
nurses, who are gradually taking tho
places of men. The experiment was
first tried In Belgium and Scotland and .
is now being adopted all over the Con
tinent as well as in America. Among
the Insane particularly this change is
urged as though the Instinct of being:
cared for by a woman when alllns
made the patient more amenable tinder
their ministrations. As the bright light
of an enlightened public sentiment Is
turned upon the administration of. the
wards of the State the â¢ Institutions
, where the insane, the epileptic and" the
'tubercular patient Is cared for will de
mand a higher degree of efficiency
among the working force and a new
place will be opened to. the trained
nurse filled with the love of her work
and a desire to serve.

THE candelabrum shown above in
the upper left-hand corner is an
attractive arrangement. The base
and stem are cut glass, simple in
design. The feet and lower base are
brass. The arms, too, are brass. An ap

network is dark wicker. The fount is
urass, specially prepared to match the
pottery. Jt is a rich, dark green. The
tones are all dull. In contrast to this is
the gay Japanese shade. This makes an
artistic and comfortable bit of furnish

Here light is importantâ its quality
end quantity. The student lamp meets
these needs. One of brushed brass, with

Green shades are best for this purpose.
The new glass is particularly beautiful.
The coloring is on the polished surface,
\u25a0while underneath is a crystal lining. It
Is white with a rough surface. There are
endless varieties of design for the
ehadc-s, though green should always pre
dominate in the coloring.

end with force in the Orient, where,
fcnoney being scarce and time of lit
tle value, one sees exquisite em
broidery, representing months of
labor and expenditure of eyesight
end nervous forces, wrought upon
coarse cotton or flimsy silk webs.
It recurs more frequently and force
fully to me in my observation of
American domestic life, the plen

houses and our homes. A critical
eye for general effects and just
Haste in the matter of harmony in
color and form- are prime factors
in furnishing our young housewife's

and both of these is sound common
sense that separates and keeps apart
the Must-haves from the May-bes.
DO NOT DO IT
We know what they are â all of
vs â and, when judgment is sane and
cool, just how to rate them. "Must
haves" represent comforts. "May
bes" stand for luxury. Some who
read this have been brought up to
reckon them as identical. The fable
of the princess who slept ill because
of "lumps in her bed," three peas
having been 6ecreted under fourteen
feather beds, is not without paral
lels in Republican America.
Ttz proverbial beggar on horse

finds himself in tbfe saddle, has a
thousand reproductions where our
pampered princess has one. The

is the delicate engraving on the brass,
which is sometimes filled with colored

and when the enameling matches or
harmonizes with the shade the effect is
exquisite. The colors, both for enamel
and shade, are innumerable. The lamp,
in all, is not over 17 inches high.
LIKE YE OLDEN TIME
There is no softer or more bewitching

As the keynote to an opus which
has a dignity of its own â fix in your
mind the resolution to be consistent
throughout. Make your living even
threaded. I have said that before,
too, and more than once, but it is
good enough to bear several repeti
tions.
To illustrate: Do not have Ori
ental rugs or velvet carpets in your
parlor and cheap, thin ingrains up
stairs. Better matting for all the
rooms â if the floors are of plain
deal â and lay down rugs of service
able filling in solid colors, that har
monize with furniture and wall pa
pers. Buy the filling by the yard;
cut it into the desired lengths and
fringe out the ends. An excellent
quality may be bought at one dollar
a yard, and, being alike on both
sides, it will last twice as long as if
it were not reversible.
Buy sheets and pillow cases in the
piece and hem/ them at home. Linen
pillow slips are a luxuryâ not a
Must-have. If your choice lies be
tween three more pairs of cotton
slips or "a change" of hemstitched
linen, give the preference to clean
liness and health. Buy the cotton â
as fine in texture. as you can afford
â and iron it so cleverly as to im
part a "linen-laid" surface.
THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED

lining, which gives "style" to your
neighbor's spare bed-chamber, cost
fifteen dollars, as she is nothing
loath to let you know. Content your
moderate desires with one of "silk-,
oline" or cretonne edged with silk of
a pleasantly contrasting color, and
save ten dollars.
You must have a generous supply
of towels for chambers and bath
room, and they should be of linenâ
unless, indeed, you happen to find,
as I did ten years ago in Paris, a
sort of cotton 6tuff in a fine honey

KEEPING THE
BATH ROOM IN
GOOD ORDER
Mary E. Carter.
Copyright. X3OÂ». by A. S. Barnes & Co.
IT IS better to have the -water closet
separate from the bath room, with
its own independent entrance. But
In that case, if it have no window
opening to outside fresh air. it will de
mand far more watchful care to keep it
pure, no matter how perfect the plumb
ing or how abundant the water flush
ing maybe. Those places always testify
unequivocally to any negligence upon
the part of persons whose- duty it is to
sve that they receive undeviatins care.
When in full sight, in a brilliantly light
ed room, any neglect ia soon evident.
It is a good plan, when they are in dark
or dimly lighted closets, to have an ex
tra and portable seat always kept upon
the one that is stationary, to protect
the latter. The portable seat can be
taken to the light, scoured in the open
air, and given a sun bath, which in al
ways the best of all purifiers.
On no account permit any one to set a
heavy pail, or any weighty thing, m
bath room wash basins. They are easily
cracked, next they leak, and replacing
them is expensive. Eternal vigilance ia
the price of enjoying nice modern con
veniences. H?BI
MATTERS OF GOOD FORM
The bath room is a suitable place for
keeping a hamptr for soiled clothes. But
damp towels should be dried befose^
they are consigned to it, and the ham
per should never reveal its contents,
neither should any soiled articles be left
upon the cover.
\u25a0 It would be a good plan if all bath
rooms, not strictly private, could have
printed rules framed and hung up In
plain sight of all bathers, giving a few
very simple admonitions upon what is
"good form" in a lavatory of any sort.
The fact is that in what might be
termed the minor morals, a great many
people seem to be deficient of all train
ing. Nowhere is this more glaringly
evident than in bath rooms used by sev
eral persons.
While, us a rule, individuals carry
their own towels and soap . to a bath
room, yet sometimes one may be com
pelled to use a cake of soap that is
there for emergencies. Whoever does
make personal use of it should at least
twine it dry before laying it back In the
soap-holder, for it is very disagreeable
, to take hold of soap that has been left
wet. This may, to some, seem over
fastidious, but a. young woman lost a
trip to Europe just because she was
careless in that particular. The friend
who was asked why she did not take her
as a companion when she wanted com
pany on a tour abroad answered: "Oh.
I cannot take her; she always leaves the
soap wet."
"HALF-BAKED" PEOPLE
. A cursory glance at a bath room re
veals the degree of refinement of those
who habitually use it. It Is, however, ,'
very unfair to Judge without knowing
if all. or only one or two, are guilty of
leaving untidy conditions.
Once upon a time. In a boarding house.
a lady, who was on her way to take a
bath, armed with a brush, sapollo and a
cloth for cleaning the * tub before sha
could use it. announced to a friend whom
she met. on the way: VI have found a
â¢ definition for a Christian. A Christian
is one who leaves a bathtub clean after
taking a bath.". Only those who have
gone through the same experience can,
sympathize with that longrsuffering one
who . had learned to her sorrow to go
prepared for. the work that awaited her.
It doe 3 seem altogether unjust that de
cent: people . should, be obliged to do
double duty in a bath room because self
respect will not permit them to follow a
bad. precedent by likewise leaving the
tub without washing and drying it.
"Well. dear,". said an experienced old
lady, upon hearing some of these things
from a younger relative who was just
beginning to go about in boarding
houses, "you will find, as you . journey
through life, that many of the people
whom you meet will be half-baked."
A GOLDE2T RULE
Half-baked .Is a synonym for under
bred or untrained. .There is no reason
why the half- baketf class should remain
doughy. Those who have not had the
advantage of good examples and train
ing at home can remedy the consequent
lack of propriety, if they desire to do so.
It is only a question of ambition to im
prove . in ; every way.. Thoughtlessness,
which ~. is seltlshness. and indolence,
which is correlated to the other two,
are the only barriers to self-improve
ment. -' '\u25a0 . '.;â¢
It is well to remember, that what seem
like trifles to the sinners are not trifles I
to those who suffer. from them. Mort-J
-: ever, we have high authority for saying â¢
that trifles light as air make up the
sum of earthly existence. Xo one 'has
ever improved - upon the Golden Rule.
Its practice would ., make a heaven .of
every home. " ', Our sorely tried friend
was right. "A Christian leaves the bath
tub clean"â obeys the Golden Rule.Women's Ways of Making Money
Working in bhops, Factories and Mills, which
Are Little Worlds of Themselves
By Cynthia Wcstovcr Alden
Ccpyricht. laOi. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
IF YOU must do factory work, then
rejoice that you are la America In
stead of England or Russia. Sir.
Dementioflf. an authority on the
question of factory work, tells us that
a woman working In a factory in Mas
sachusetts receives three times the pay
of a woman in Moscow, doing exactly
the same work, and one-third more than
is paid in England; yet we think here
our work wages are on starvation rates.
The great mass of our population be
longs to the industrial class, and when
you go into a factory, no matter what
Is the work done or how tmall the pay.
It seems to be a little world by itself.
When superintendent of one of the
large factories in Grea'er New York, it
became a daily prayer with me that in
some way the minimum age for the em
ployment of children might be raised;
yien I prayed just as hard that I might
bfc able to find places for the groups of
half-starved little folks who applied
for work. To be worked to death is,
after all. preferable to being starved
to death. I longed to be in power to
reduce the regular working hours, to
Five good pay for all overtime, and to
better the sanitary conditions, etc.. that
the young people might work and at
the ume time feel that they lived.
But I do not wish to talk on legislation.
or to tell how by doing certain things
the nation might gain in comfort.health.
contentment, leisure and prosperity. Wo
are merely facing the fact, that for
many women and girls factory work \u
the only chance.
The One Who Wins.
Go straight to the mills and apply for
work In any department where "the em
ployment of a novice can be made use
ful Don't be discouraged. Take any
thing you caa get. Keep up heart and
elm for advancement Always be ready
to try to' fill any vacancy. The person
who Iff "always on hand" generally gets
the Job. The beat equipped worker "on
hand" is necessarily pushed forward. It
Is not luck at all ; It is the result of
faithfulness In your dally routine work
and the "being on hand" that helps you
cut.
In upholstery, workwomen are con
fined mostly to sewing, while men secure
the best-paid branches of the trade.
The work Is not so eacy as it eeems.
It requires skill to even sew on fringe
and do It right. On an average a girl
works from three to live years "before
\u25a0he thoroughly knows her trade. She
learns to tew draperies, fringes, curtains
and covers; she sews and vielts leather,
and makes or sews carpet.
Girls are paid according to their abil
ity, seldom beginning on less than $2 or
V3*a week. A beginner is not told so very
much what to do. She is put into a
room with other workers, and is left
much 'to her own ingenuity and wit as
to "getting on."
Some forge right ahead, and, as fore
women are taken from the ranks of
workers, the smartest are advanced.
In one large firm, where several hun
dred girla are employed, I asked why
men <iid the cutting. The answer was
startling: "Because girls don't know
enough to do It. If one Is found wno
can be taught, she is apt to get mar
ried any minute and leave her employer
in the lurch, whereas if a msn gets a
good place and marries, he stlcUs clostr
i co his Job than ever." . \u25a0
The assumption that women cannot
cut to make anvihins flt do>s r.ot hold,
because when women co.irilo this uasl
ness for themselves they generally suc
ceed. There is much work In upholsicr
icg. such as the stuffing" and the cut-
ting of heavy cloth, which women are
physically not strong enough to do. It
a woman has her own shop she has
men who work under her direction: .
In learning the trade of upholstering
it is well to learn every branch of it,
and thus be in condition to supervise
Jhe doing of alf .kinds-, of work. By
peeping her eyes open, a woman can
learn much by observation, and, com-^
pared with ordinary factory occupa
tions, upholstering is a good trade.' The
work is not unhealthy and the wages are
fair. To obtain this worÃ, visit" all the
furniture and upholstery shops you can
find. If you are handy with the needle
you can fit in somewhere, and If you
are worthy and observing you will so6n
climb. "â¢ ""*
The machinery of these great estab
lishments must go on, and many a wom
an has climbed to the very top of her
work by making herself ready to step
up when the opportunity came.
"Extra Piecework.
In some factories there is extra work
given out to be done in the homes.
While this indirectly tends to lower
wages by producing an artificial stand
ard of output, your invalid sister or aged
mother cannot go to the factory, and
they must work to help eke out a living.
Therefore, get all this "extra" that you
can and take it home with you. What
the home work brings in may range
from $2 to $4 a week. Your own wages
may be only $3: There is a possibility
of them amounting to $10. and $15 â sel
dom $15. however.
It was when the factories, mills and
workshops took up the greater part of
the work done In the home that the
women were first driven into themâ or,
in other words, driven from earning a
living at home. If you have any choice,
try and get work where the regulations
for men and women are equal. I know
of several china factories and potteries
where ( jhc women work side by side
with the men, receiving equal pay and
the same treatment In general. Yet in"
many establishments the pay is so little
and the work so death-dealing it seems
I am , not a. good friend to help you
get it. Still, my advice always is. "to
take the last chance." It is the person
who is aft aid to venture that gets car
ried over to charity. According to the .
little story of .Leo Tolstoy,, the best
friend's advice, however. Is not always
good.
Her "Last Chance."
A man condemned to prison life suc
ceeded in escaping. But when he came
to a deep river near the prleon he found
to his dismay that there was no bridge,
only a half-rotten plank. He could' not
swim, tso. he must try the plank. His
worst enemy and his best friend were
close behind him. The enemy said noth
ing, but his best friend. shouted:
'â¢"â¢"or heaven's sake, what are you
doing? Don't you sec that the board is
rotten?"
"But it is my 'last chance,' "cried the
unfortunate, man, and he started to
cross. . â¢
."No, no," sobbed the friend, catching
him and pulling him back, "1 cannot let
you risk your life." S"N36Â§BS~~ISi~'HI
They struggled until the persecutor
came up and look the runaway back to
his life-Io:sg imprisonment. The good
friend bewailed the result, but said, ' "1
could not let him risk his life. The
board was surely half-rotten." â¢ ..
The working woman's "last chance"
is often. -very often, the half-rotten
bo&rd; still, I advise her. to eross ''It
fcvery lime. ---If she hax courage she. will
generally. get over, but If she hesitates -
she is lost- anyway. It Is no, disgrace
to enter any honest, healthy employ
ment; If it is not healthy, and honest, it
should not exist.

Hints About Giving Dinner Parties
Laying the Table and the Matter o! Name and
Menu Cards and Decorations
By Eleanor B. Clapp
CopyriKht. 1903. by A. S.. Barnes & Co.
WHEN fiving a very large din
ner party, it is better to have
everything carved in the
kitchen, and handed round to
each guest in" succession â and to have
nothing eatable on the table except the
dessert. It is not, however, possible to
have this unless there are a sufficient
number of servants to wait. Therefore,
when the establishment Is small and
the dinner a rather informal one. it is
much better to make a compromise, as
it wereâ that is, let the servants pass
round the entree and vegetables for
each guest to help himself or herself,
and to have the fish, roast and game
placed upon tho table for. the host to
carve.
-At an ordinary dinner party the guests
leave early, and no amusement is con
sidered, necessary. They merely con
verse together.- or a little music is
given; but "when there are any young
people among. the guests, a round game
of cards, or. a game of "bridge" or
"pit,"- or whatever; the favorite pas
time may be, is indulged In; and by the
term "young people" I do not mean only
youths and maidens, but youmji married
persons as well, -who are of tea Just as
fond of a game to wind up the evening
with as are thejr "unmarried brothers and
sisters. Of course," the number of
guests that can be entertained at din
ner must* always be limited, and de
pends entirely ..upon .;' the size of one's
dining room, and also. It is needless to
add, the length" s i purse possessed by
the host and hostess. A small dinner,
given by people of moderate means,
should always be a simple one, with only
those ..dishes that are in season and
within (thie power of one's cook to turn
but ".. properly, . for to attempt anything
elaborato without the proper facilities
is, to court certain failure.
A Small Dinner Party for Moderate
Means.
.Because your Income is limited is not
reason sufficient to debaryou from en
tertaining.. The only thing needful is
to - know how to gather your friends
about you, provide them, with an excel
lent, well-served dinner, and not exceed
the moderate sum' that Is all that can be
devoted to such ' luxuries.
See to itat first that your. table linen
has been laundered .'well and ironed
smoothly/ with only .one crease. Your
dining table is, of course, covered with
a table felt, which ISiVery thick canton
flannel. '. Fold your ; napkins * four times
in Ironing, and. then make one more fold
with the hand;. to, hold the. bread, and
place them at the 'left of [the forks.
Never .use (the family napkin rings
.when entertaining.
v - "Laying the Table.
\u25a0*' At each \ place put one of -your best
dinner. plates? in which the oyster plate
Is ]io s bV set. " Place" at the " right of , the
service plate ; as'many knives as win be
required^before "the dessert, " each one
wilhjithe ; sharp edge turned toward the
pliLte.^andln^the^order In which they
will; be needed, beginning at the; ex
treme right. : At the right of the knives
place the spoon for soup; which should
be a tablespoon or soup spoon with the
i nslde of ; the bowl turned up ; then the
oyster fork "at the extreme right. At the
left place as many forks as will be need
ed, "and in the order -in" which
be used. The fish fork at the extremo
left and the entree fork next; then the
fork for the roast, which, of course,
â¢should be the largest: then the fork for
salad, all with the tines turned up, the
last fork close to the plate. IT you
have not many courses the dessert
spoon and fork may be on the table
from the beginning; but If the meaLis
rather elaborate, omit them -until des
sert is served; too profuse a display of
silver is apt to be vulgar.
At the upper right hand of the plate,
near the centre, place a tumbler or gob
let for water; if wine is used, the glass
will take the place above the knives.
Place the napkins with a small piece of
bread infolded at the left of the forks
or upon the service plate, if preferred-
Name and Menu Cards.
At ceremonious dinners where there
are many guest 3 it is usual to have
name cards at each place, so that there
may be no confusion and the guests can
tell where they are to sit. These the
hostess usually prepares herself by writ-
Ing the same of the person for whom
the seat is Intended upon a small card,
either plain or gilt-edged. Sometimes
dainty name cards of water-color paper
are used, with a flower or some other
simple device painted in one corner. The
name cards should be put on the top of
the dinner napkins at each plate.
"When menu cards are used â and tbesa
are only necessary at very large and
formal functionsâ one card is all that Is
needed for every two guests, and it is
either laid on the cloth or placed in one
of the small gilt or silver wire easel
frames that coma for the purpose be
tween the plates of the lady and gentle
man who have coma out to dinner to
gether.
Butter has absolutely no place on a
well-appointed dinner table, and indi
vidual butter plates should never be
used at dinner. Bread is never passed,
the, only bread used betas the roll or
small square piece that is folded In the
napkin. This is eaten dry. with tha
.soup.
The decorations of the table should ba
modest. Flowers in tho centra or a
â¢ growing plant are always in order. It is
also In good taste to place a vary nÂ»Â»H
bunch or a single flower at each plate.
One or two small silver or glass dishes,
containing bonbons or salted almonds.
are usually placed on the table. Avoid
using salt-shakers, even ix that should
be your- habit when alone. Place two
small salt cellars and individual peppers,
one black and one red, diagonally oppo
site each other on the table.
The Question of lighting tha dining
table is quite an Important one., espe
cially if one lives in the country where
lamps must be used. Don't put one on
the dining table, but place It on a small
table in a corner and have It shaded.
On the table place four rather tall
candlesticks with fancy colored shades
on the long candles; the light from
these witl oe soft without glare, and
will be In much better taste than having
too fierce or strong a light.
. Don't forget your finger bowls, which
should be only one-half filled with
water, and have some small flower float-
Ins on top. or. even a geranium leaf, if
you can find nothing else; they can be
filled with water and 'stood on the side
board throughout the meal. ; Each finger
bowl should be placed on a fruit plata.
which has on it a small dolly,' :NAME PUZZLES

German Ruler Aims to Drive Out Toy Monarchs art^ King Business
Wilhelt7i Wants to 'Transform Fatherland
Into One Big United Country.
Is Anxious to Do Away With Little
Scandal-Breeding State Courts.
Special Cable to The Call.
BERLIN*. Oct. 21. â Kaiser Wilhelm's
latest and most startling ambition is
said to be that of forming himself into
*n imperial monopoly by gradually
wiping out the expensive toy mon
archs of the other German states, who
try to compete with him in dig
nity, thus transforming Germany into
one united country with one central
ired administrate^ system. The tend
ency of the age is evident among the
courts of Germany as In every sphere
of life, and the Kaiser may be com
pared to a growing trust which will
eventually absorb all the small and
weak competitors.
If the Kaiser has been less active
in this direction than he might have
been his lack of initiative has prob
ably been due to considerations of
Belf-preservation. Although the little
States of Germany have been badly
governed for centuries there is no
doubt that the existence of so many
courts brings the monarchical idea
tome to many Germans to whom It
might otherwise be foreign.
If the smaller Btates can be gradu
ally s.bsorbed by Prussia without open
blows at monarchical institutions .there
is no doubt that the Kaiser will wel
come the change. He Is frequently
impatient of the necessity of sharing
his supreme authority with the super
fluous little sovereigns who occupy the
thrones of the smaller sta.tes of the
empire. On various occasions the
Kaiser has made them feel that they
are his vassals and has treated them
as subordinates, a procedure which
some of them have keenly resented.
At present Germany ie not an abso
lute empire, but a confederation of
wine score of sovereign states who
have combined oh the basis of a
conraon nationality to present a united
front to foreign countries. The Ger
man Emperor, unlike the Emperors of
Russia and Austria, is nothing more
than the hereditary president of .the
confederation of German states. The
German Emperor as such is a strictly
constitutional monarch, and it is as
King of Prussia that he enjoys such
extensive personal power over his sub-
jects. \u25a0\u25a0-
The present Kaiser has contrived to
make us forget moat of these facts.
He Is himself so prominent a figure In
the affairÃ of his country that the
world has almost forgotten the exist
ence of all the remaining German.mon
arebs who are theoretically quite equal
to the Emperor Jn rank and dignity.
THE KAISER'S COLLEAGUES.
Apart from the Kaiser there are
twenty indepenaent monarchs in Ger- I
many. Three KJiiks, six Grand Dukes,
four Dukes end seven reigning Princes.
Some of those states are so small that
thÂ© maintenance of their sovereign
rights is an absurdity in the twentieth
century. Their- existence dates from
the times when Central Europe dot
ted with large numbers of small feu
dal mates, each ruled by its own petty
monarch.
The smallest German state is tlie
principality of Schaurninirg - 7Jpp<\
which contains a total p<>p;:h;t;..?i of
10,000. The capital of triis :i... i .tur"
country is an overgrown vii!aÂ«< .ailed
Buckc-berpr. with a population of 5000.
The crown of SÂ«-h:iu:nburÂ»?-L!ppe is
worn by a Prince, and the Government
is carried on by a Prime Minister, aid
ed by a Council of State and an elected
representative assembly.
Sehwarzbuns-Sonderlmuscn has a
total population of 80,000, and its vil
lage capital. Sondtrhausen. has a pop
ulation of 7000. Schwarzburg-Rndol-
The San Francisco Call.
stadt has a total population of 80,000.
and its capital, Rudolstadt, has a pop
ulation of 12.000. The Grand Duchy of
Mecklenburg Strelitz lias a total popu
lation of 100,000. and its capital. Neil
Strelitz. has a population of 11,000. The
principality of Lippe contains a popu
lation of 140.000. and its capital. Det
n-.old. nas a population of 11,000. The
principality of Reuss (Younger Line)
has a population of 140.000. The duchies
of Saxe-AKenburg; Saxe-Coburg-Gotha
and Saxe Meinlnsren fach have popula
tions varying between L'oo.ooo and 300.
000. and the duchy of Anhalt has a pop
ulation of a little more than 300,000.
The grand duchies of Saxe- Weimar and
Oldenburg each have an approximate
population of -100.000. and the irrand
d^icky of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which
recently supplied the German Crown
Prinoo with his bride, has a population
of 600.000. The grand duchy of Hosse
lias a population of 1.000.V00. The srar.d
duchy of Baden has a population of
1.500.000.
S3IALLER THAX NEW YORK.
Each of these sovereign German
statos has thus a population less than
that of New York or Cnicago. The king
dom of Wurtemburg has a poula
tion of a little more than j 2,000,
000, the kin&uoin of Saxony a little
more than 4.000.000 and the kingdom of
Bavaria a little more than 6,000,000,
and all these states are overshadowed
by Prussia, with its population of 35,
000,000. Apart from the Imperial Chan
cellor, Prince Itulow. and the central
federal ' Government. Germany pos
sesses twenty Prime Ministers, twenty
Cabinets, twenty royal courts and
eighteen Parliaments, for two German
statys, Mecklenburg - Schtverin and
Mecklenburg-Ftrelitz, are absolute mon- |
archies, governed by their Grand Dukes
without any assistance from elected
representatives of the people. â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0
The cost of maintaining all these
monarchies, with their courts and
households* is a heavy financial burden
for the German nation.
USELESS JIOXAHCHS.
The bare cost of the monarchs alone
thus amounts to something between
$6,000,000 and $7,000,000 per annum. In
addition to the monarchs it must be
remembered that there are twenty
Prime Ministers and over . a hundred
Cabinet Ministers, all drawing salaries
from the public revenues for their ser
vices to the different states. There are
twenty royal households, with several
hundred highly salaried ornamental of
ficials, and eighteen Parliaments, the
members of which receive payment
from the public exchequers.
The twenty royal courts In Germany
are effective supports of reactionary
politics and personal snobbery. The
little German courts have been fruitful
of all sorts of queer situations and
scandals. The throne of Bavaria has
been occupied for the last twenty years
by a raving madman, who crawls about
on his hands and knees, barks like- a
dog and eats his food off the ground.
Nevertheless this being, although more
beast than man, is his Majesty King
Otto of Bavaria by divine right. His
predecessor^ King Louis, was also a
lunatic and drowned himself. The fu
ture King of Bavaria, Prince Rupprecht,
lias been Involved In matrimonial scan
dals and his quarrels .with his wife
have been a public secret for some
years past. , ,
HOTBEDS: OF SCAJVDAL.
The scandals connected with the
Saxon royal family, which culminated
in the flight of the wife of the' present
King, are too fresh in the public mem
ory to need repetition. The Grand Duke
of Hesse was obliged to divorce his
wife after a series of scandals, which
brought his court Into terrible Â«dls
repute. The wife of the Grand Duke
of Saxe-Welmar ran away from him
shortly after their wedding and fled to
Switzerland. The Grand Duke was
obliged to go In pursuit of her, and, al
though he succeeded In bringing her
back they never lived happily together, '
and the young' Grand Duchess recently i
died of a ' broken heart. The Grand!
Duke of Oldenburg was obliged to ex- j
pel one of his court officials for seduc
ing his daughter, Princess Sophie Char
lotte. court official in question, an
aristocrat by birth, emigrated to Amer
ica and is still living In New York. "
The Dowager Grand Duchess .of
Mecklenburg-Behwerln ran away with
her own hairdresser. The throne of
Lippe was occupied only recently by. a
.hopeless lunatic, and. since his -death a
dispute regarding the possession of the
crown has been proceeding. The throne
of Reuss (elder line) is also occupied
by a lunatic, who will never be capable
of governing his dominions. The reign-
Ing Prince of .Reuss (younger line) ab
dicated after contracting a mesalliance
and handed over the reins of govern
ment to his son, who has also b^en in
volved in fifteen public scandals. Â»;
The Grand Duke -of Saxe^Coburg-
Gotha, who :is not -quite 21 years of
age, is already involved' in a serious
dispute with his subjects, which has
made him intensely unpopular - among
them. The rightful Duke of Bruns

IS SAID TO

Special Cable to The Call.
LONDOX, Oct. 21.â 1t has been said
that if the day ever- comes when Lord
Kitchener succumbs to feminine blandish
ments it will be found that an American
girl has captured him. Stories of his en
gagement are again afloat, and there Is
good reason to believe that this time
they are well founded. When Mrs. Adalr
was In India. for the Durbar there was a
particularly interesting and willful young
American girl staying with ,her (who
must for the present be nameless) and
she stormed the citadel of his lordship's
heart by sheer audacity. Far and wide
and with Lord Kitchener's own authority
has been circulated the report that he
was determined never to marry, but ever
since he met Mrs. Adair's friend he has
been struggling -between his affections
and the feeling that the world will regard
him as inconsistent if he yields.
Mrs. Adair, who is, as every one knows,
one of the most Intimate and valued
friends of Lord Kitchener, is like most
kind-hearted women an inveterate match
maker, and 'when she was In India left
'nothing undone to bring things to a cli
max, being bitterly disappointed when
she did not succeed. Her efforts, how
ever, are not likely to prove in vain, for
the fair American was visiting the Cur
zons (before the resignation of Lord Cur
zon was thought of); and she saw a great
deal of the commander.. in. chief. She
proved " herself a young woman of dis
crimination when she said Lord Kitch
ener must have altered. considerably since
Stevens wrote his remarkable description
of him.. "During all the years "of prepa
ration and achievement the man has dis
appeared ;r only .the Sirdar remains, nei
ther asking affection nor giving It."
"I guess that ; Is wrong." said the girl,
"for he has squeezed my hand many a
time." \u25a0:, â¢ . ,; .'

PERFUMERY
TASTES ARE
EXPENSIVE
Duchess of Rox
burghe's Costly
Special Cable to ThÂ« CalL
LONDON. Oct. 21.â At one time Lady
Curzon had the reputation of spending
more money on scents than any other
woman in England. It was said that
she was more extravagant in this re
spect than Queen .Alexandra, whoso
scent bills amounted to something: like
$5000 a year. Now. the story goes, that
the Duchess of Roxburgh*; has become
the most extravagant purchaser of per
fumery in the land. She # patronizes the
heavy-scented essences "of the j East,
which are known to be most expensive.
The cost of her daily bath would, it is
nald. keep a middle-class family for A
week.
Lady Cunon used to patronize these
same essences at one time, but shÂ«
found* them so expensive that she de
cided to try cheaper extracts. Queen
Alexandra, too. has gone in for re
trenchment in the same direction, and
she is now satisfied with the favorite
scent of the late Queen Victoria, which
was a species of lavender water spe
cially prepared for her by a chemist at
"Windsor. The Princess of Wales is also
some v. hat extravagant in the use of
scents, and u<?es a special preparation
made from violets and other specially
cultivated flowers. It is somewhat
strange that Lady Suffolk dislikes
scents, considering her sister's passion
f c^r them. * ; W~

RESIDENT OF GRVSS VALLEY WHO HAS BEEN* EXALTED TO THE HIGHEST
OHIEFTAIN-CT IN THE DEGREE OF rOCAHONTAS. AND OTHER- ACTIVE MEM
BERS OF FRATERNAL SOCIETIES OF THIS STATE. L . ;'
'Good news comes from Sacramento
Knights of Pythias. The lodges and
members, through an incorporated hall
association, have purchased the old
hall property, once lost to them, and
have expended $5000 in remodeling and
renovation: have now J5OO in the treas
ury, with an income from the hall
property of $200 per month, with a
debt of about $2000. It will be but a
biiort time when the property will be a
paying investment. The energetic
members of the order of that city, to
whose untiring labor this result may
be ascribed, deserve praise and com
mendjition.
Much controversy has arisen and
considerable doubt appears to exist
among the members of the order con
cerning adoption of the proposed re
duction of the minimum age for admis
sion to the order to 18 years. The fact
5s that the matter was considered by
the Supreme Lodge at Its last con
vention and received a small majority
vote in that body. Under the supreme
constitution the proposed' amendment
was not adopted, and must now be re
ferred to, considered and be adopted by
the individual Grand Lodges at their
next conventions, prior to that of the
Supreme Lodge of. 1906. The matter
will then be considered by the Supreme
Lodgf, based upon the action of the
Grand Lodges. When voted upon each
Grand Lodge will be entitled to one
vote, and if the proposition receives a
majority vote of all the Grand Lodges
it will then be adopted and become a
law of the order and go into effect im
mediately.
Many inquiries have been made as to
the amendment of the law relating to the
terms of officers of subordinate lodges.
The opinion seems to prevail that the
Lena was changed from one year to six
months, as formerly. Such is not the
case. While the matter was submitted
to the last held Grand Lodge it failed
bt adoption when the vote was taken.
The terms of officers of subordinate
lodges is therefore still one year.
On the evening of September 27 a dis
trict meeting of the lodges comprising
district No. 9 was held in the city of
Oakland, Deputy Grand Chancellor
Charles B. Hood presiding. The meet
ing was remarkably well attended and
the various speakers who addressed it
>;-.ld many things of wit, wisdom and
value to those present. Literary and
musical numbers interspersed the ad
dresses. Grand Chancellor D. C. Clark
was the chief spokesman of the even-
Ing, assisted by Past Supreme Repre

well, having a : membership now of
nearly. 150 members. There was a time,
not so long ago. when the lodge was
entitled to only one representative in
the Grand Lodge. It is different now,
and very much of the progress the
lodge has made may be attributed to
:ha energetic activity of the chancellor
Â« ommander, John M. Lorton, ably as^
Fisted by thÂ«Â» old-timers, such as Huber,
Beaver and others. The lodge's ex
chequer now contains more than $2000.

<Mon, I again invaded the Orpheum
this week, this time to chat with Ar
thur Prince. Now Arthur is a ventrilo
quist. He is the best you have ever
heard â dollars to doughnuts. Small
wonder when! â but that later. But Mr.
Prince is a ventriloquist, a Sunday one;
but still simply a ventriloquist. I went
. ra him as king of his craft to find out
how one could say: "Peter Piper picked
a. peck of pickled peppers," and have
the other boy in the next room blamed
for It. Thought it might come in use
fuL Wondered if they could not use
the likes of* It at .the Tivoli on pretty

Micaela this week and sings like Poor
PoIL I intended to ask Mr. Prince
about voice producti6n; if he had ever
been able to persuade Mrs. Prince that
she had said "yes" when she had said
"no" and had meant to say "yes."
How he is able to talk while he Is
drinking? (Mother would never allow
us toâ but .then Mr. Prince does it so
nicely.) Little respectable things like
that I meant to ask him.
He looked quite as you and I as I
met him behind the scenes at the Or
pheum. We went there Into the little
"reception" room. Quite the "suitable
surroundings" the room provided. You
go down steps into It as. into a vault.
It is Iron-lined, dusty and defunct vau
devillains adorning the windowless
walls, and visible creeps in the air. The
slim, young gentleman dusted one
kitchen chair with his lieutenant's uni
form And I dusted another, and ordi
narily enough vre began to talk. Af
terward he told me he had acted the
part of Sherlock Holmes, and he looks
most like that, lean, keen-eyed, wiry,
tense, the greyhound type.
He did tell me how he made his B's
and P*s for "Jim's" voice before he
introduced me to his "subliminal self."
You make lins of the back of your
\u25ba'â¢^gue and palate and the frick is done.
Jt was when I asked Mr. PrJnce how
he "threw" his voice here and there
that I began to suspect things.
"Can't do that without 'Jim,' " the
ventriloquist said.
"Of course not!" I laughed.
"Really I can't," he insisted, quite
seriously.
"Oh. well, bring- 'Jim,' " I laughed.
"I shall be delighted to meet Jiim."
And Mr. Prince went to fetch "Jim"
and I began to wonder. Was "Jim" a
small Frankenstein, or alive? The re
turn of the ventriloquist with "Jim's"
head In one hand and his manly middy's
form In the other gave me a ridiculous
sense of reassurance. The head was
stuck like a turnip on the' top of a
BtJck, and Mr. Prince handed it to me
to look at.
"Almost human, isn't he?" he asked
â "touch him â won't hurt you!"
He laugrfced as I put a gingerly finger
to Jim's chin. It was absurdly soft,
find I could have sworn It was warm!
"What it, it?" I asked.
"Wax " the ventriloquist replied,
planting Jim's head where it belongs
and sitting the figure on his knee, j
"He's the first I had. Had a lot of I
trouble over him. He's 11 years old
now â "
"Twelve!"
This was from "Jim!"
A trick, of course, but startling.
"Very good," I laughed. "But now
tell me truly do you really mean that i
you find It easier to talk 'Jim' with !
â¢Jim' here?" !
fc "I teally mean," Mr. Prince ex
plained, "that I cannot talk Jim â as
you put it â without 'Jim.' "
"Do you actually mean to say," I in
sisted on it, "that that thing talks of
Itself?"
They put if at the Psychical Research I
Society in London â oh, yes, I'm a speci- j
m*n â that somehow Jim and nvy^sub- '
llminal self get mixed up and that he I
says thing's that I. personally, my ob
jective mind, would never think of â "
* "He's not clever enough, are you
Billy?" Jim interrupted.
"Ohâ" I cried. And the thing did look
so very human! A genial, droll, cocky,
little runt of boyâ too human.
"Talk to him," said "Jim's" master.
"Want to Interview me or Mm?" Jim
asked. Billy's familiar is a small. British.

I meanâ and generally just enlisted.
I gave up to the jest. "Is he good to
you?" I asked Jim.
"'E's all right in 'is wy." Jim laughed,
"gen'rally, that Is. Larst week 'c didn't
look arfter me as 'c should, left me under
three ton of stuff in the baggage car.
Didn't like thatâ you wouldn't.",
"No more I should, Jim," I said, not
for the moment, realizing the absurdity of
the reply. Then I asked who wrote the
sketch of the week, Jim or his master?
"Billy" replied.
"The sketch is not written," he said.
"I get the shell of a subject, so to speak,
and simply go on stage and wÂ« talk it
out."
"I do the comedy," Jim chipped in.
1 **Sh!" said his master. "As I said, I
get the ideaâ lt is 'four hours on and
four hours off' this week, and the talk
comes. You'll notice it Is different this
week from last. In London now, where
we slay at one theatre for six months,
we. chanse the act every week."
"Is Jim always a middy?" I ask. '
"My word, I should sy so!" said Jim.
"I beg your , oh," I laughed.
"Yes, he's always a middy," Mr. Prince
confirmp-d, "and I'm always a lieuten
ant." We raise Jim in rank in that six
months, don't we, Jim? '
"I should sax so!"
"How is it that you know so much
about the navy?" I asked.
"Studied for it," the young man re
plied, "started to be a doctor in the
navy. Then I changed my profession."
"You can't be very old "
"*E*s twice as old as me," Jim slid in.
'It -was NOT canny. It was uncannily
quick. It was uncannily different. The
switch of personality was too complete,
too swift, to be ordinary trick ventril
oquism. The voice, accent, tone, vocabu
lary flashed from one into the other In a
fashion I despair of describing in the
limits of this kind of story. There they
were at it!
I had told Prince that his sketch re
minded me of W. "A. Jacobs' delightful
sea stuff. That brought up the subject
of "The Beauty and the Barge," with
which Cyril Maude and a company de
lighted all London for months and that
dropped dead in New York after one
week, and with Nat Goodwin. Mr.
Prince's manager had come in. Prince
and he had agreed that they could not
see Goodwin In the part of a London
bargee. "Nor me," Jim agreed. Prince
then said, "Jim gives a good imitation
of Maude, doesn't he?" to the manager.
"Just the voice and everything. How
does that speech go?"
The manager had forgotten.
I Prince began it. But he'd forgot
ten, too. "How does it go, Jim?" he
asked, and Jim "spieled" it off with evi
dent joy. A trick just as easily as not,
I grant, but not quite possible in this
superlatively effective fashion.
I asked again: "Does Jim ever talk
:to you when you are by yourselves â
self?"
"Absolutely, yes," Jim's master af
firmed. "Mind. I claim only that it is
a case of the projecting of my sub
conscious selfâ"
And the creature cried in its imper
tinent cockney: "Let me live!"
I began to think then of the book
people â how they stalk through and
haunt the novelist's brain until he
writes them out. I asked Mr. Prince
if he had ever written.
This is what he said. It is worth re
membering as light on "Jim": "Yes;
I write sometlmos. Sometimes you have
to write, you know. Often I don't
know what it is I am" writing. Phrases
Just write themselves, and I look vat
them afterwaia. Sometimes I'll say
while I am writing, 'No; that can't be
right." but I have to go on. Then I find
quite often that I have written some good
things."
It was Jim that told me that "Billy"
is also a /hypnotist and mesmerist. I
asked if he were also what is known
as ..clairvoyant.
He claims to be. He says he cannot
play a game ot cards because he can
Bee with the smallest effort the hands
his opponents hold. that he sits down to
lose the game.
He has a bookful of opinions on hyp
notism â one that you cannot "wrong
the power' and retainit.
"I think I shall go," I said at last.
I'm scared. This weird thingâ"
"Hear that! My word!" it said. "She
calls me a weird thing!"

On "Wednesday evening "Otello" will
be repeated, rSo far this is by much
the most-satisfying production of the
season. Polacco gives a beautiful
reading of the opera and the opera it
self Is the master work of .its master
maker. Salassa's lago is as good as
one's memory of it. which is as tha
finest individual performance ever giv
en at the Tivoli. | Angioietti again
is possibly, the beat Otello. we have had.
He more nearly fulfills the dramatic
requirements of the role, sings better,
has better to sing with. And I am per
suaded that his first night's Otello did
not represent all that Signor Angioietti
can do with the role. The ' Desdemona
is unexpectedly effective; in Petrella's
hands. - Neither . in temperament nor
voice- Is Petrella naturally adapted to
the role, but she contrives to keep her
dramatic . exuberance charmingly with
in bounds and her vocal - abundance
well within the gentle limits of . tha
role. Grass! is a good Emilia, and the
rest of the. cast fills in happily.- Nor

"La Boheme" is also to be given

"Lucia" goe3 on Thursday, and to

But, oh, to be Caliph of Eddy street
this week. If I were Madame Eame.i
should not escape from San Francisco
without, leaving one Desdemona behind
her â not to speak of an Aida! I'm
sure she would sing It if she could only
hear Mr. Salassa's lago and Mr. Polao
'eo's masterly leading. For the ' rest I
hereby offer the dollar I had saved up

It's all I have.

The Eames concerts' come this week
and are about as promising in- programme
as It is possible for them to be. Their
crowning interest Is. of course, the ap
pearance of the fascinating prima donna
on the concert platform, but besides this
there j will be beard with the singer a
barytone of considerable distinction In
! Signor Emlllo Gogorza. a 'cellist In Herr
Joseph Hoilman. who Is also most con
fidently heralded, and a pianist in Mr.
Amherst Webber, who is said to be full
worthy of his company.
The concerts are two, to be given on
Thursday evening and Saturday after
noon next at the Alhambra Theater. Both
programmes, are brilliantly interesting.
Madame Eames herself will sing a Mozart
aria at the first concert, and who does not
recall her most beautiful ladyship in that
most beautiful "Nozze dl Figaro"? The
"Hamlet" duet, which she will give with
Signor GoKorza, will be another number
of exceptional interest. Hollman has
one of the "biggest modern "'cello works
in Boellman's Symphonic Variations, that
I believe will be h*Â»ard for the first time
here from Mr. Hollman's bow. The re- :
mainder of the programmes are equally
worthy and interesting.

SMART SET GROWS SERIOUS
Society has grown amazingly sane
and cultural and unusually philan
thropic.
The number cf debutantes â and It's
the debutantes that regulate the pace
of society â is so small that the winter
promises many "silent moments" for
the elect. This, in turn, augurs ill fcr
a fashionable physicif-n, who waxes fat
upon the crop of nervous breakdowns
every gay winter, and last winter was
a record-breaker, for the pace was
mad.
To be cure, the dancing clubs will
hold their revels â which are growing
lesÂ§ gay as the personnel of the clubs
grows older, fatterâ but beyond these
and the presence of ' Mrs. Peter
Martin in town, together with
Mrs. Fr*>d Kohl, there is to be a sanc
tified and scholastic air about the
smart set.
True, there are a number of smart
\u25a0weddings on the cards, notably the
Hamilton-Spreckels, the Huse-Wells
and the Pillshury-Kohl affairs, but
weddings at best are solemn affairs.
As for larjrc private dances, and they
usually are some fun, there is but one
in prospect â and that only in prospect
â the coming out function of Genevieve
Harvey, that is said to be contemplated
by her devoted grandmamma, Mrs.
Eleanor Martin. And by the way, it
has been said that It was just this
â¢ort of prodding- that provoked Mrs.
Martin into giving the splendid ball
last year in honor of Anita Harvey.
That affair and the Borel ball led the
season in the way of private enter
tainment, but wili they be repeated
this year? As for the Borels, they will
hardly entertain en a very large scale,
as they are preparing for a year's visit
ir Switzerland, But will Mrs. Martin
redeem the "season?
The lull in the madness of teas and
the tedium of dinners is bearing fruit,
for already every smart maid and ma
tron with .brains enough â or who is
clever enough to simulate brains
esiough â has Joined one" of the dozen
lecture courses now on. These cover
everything from French history, down
through purple mysteries of art, into
the realistic realm of cooking:, sewing:
and such domestic commonplaces $.s
how to retain a husband when you get
one â this question being up to the
President a few days" ago by a
"Mothers' Club" â how to tame servants
and rear bahies. I have reason to be
lieve, however, that the history, art
and Browning sections are drawing
fuller houses, for It is one of the para
doxes of human nature that the things
we most need to know are the things
we pass by.
As for the phil?_nthrcpic turn of so
ciety, that is not unusual, for nowhere
in the world are the smart women so
universally intereeted in some pet phil
anthropy. If you don't believe it just
ask some of their men friends.
That the winter will be comparatively
quiet is really a matter of congratulation
to papas and indulgent \ husbands and
to the maids and matrons for a "silent
hour" for eelf-knowledge. But how
about the society medico, the exquisite
little nurse, and the tradespeople who
thrive upon a mad winter?
â¢ â¢ â¢
Now, what do you think of that?â the
arraignment h a Russian Count Count
Molyncki of Welhynion. of American 60
ciety women, and of San Francisco wo
men in particular, when a careful can
vass of smart leaders hereabouts falls to
reveal any one Â»n society wh* had the
honor of the Count's : cquaintance.
Could it be that the Count confused Pa
cific a\-enue with Pacific street?
The knowledge tuat a real truly Count
was among us and that he got away be
fore he was discovered by society is
really worthy of Investigation. Even the
Burlingame set, which usually sce"hts a
Count or a Baron from afar, knew noth
ing of him. Where did he hide himself
while here?
Now. he goes to St. Louis and says
we, with other Americans, "are horrid
and impossible. The women compel you
to marry them upon the slightest pre
text, and men resent another man's
speaking to their wives." Now, wouldn't
It Interest you to know how the Count
derived his deductions, and where?
Likewise if any San Franciscan tried
to eiarry him unawares? Could it be that
some clever society maid met him when
he made his debut here, and kidnaped
him. tn the hope of winning a . title by
way of ransom?
The Count goes on to say that "He likes
Newport, where he saw the best Amer
ican society. In the West, he saw the
worst."
This statement confirms the opinion
that the Count must not have stirred far
from the district of ruby lights and;
mirthless music.

PORTLAND. Oct. 31.â M. O. Miller, a
young man employed as a baggage hand
ler at the Union' Depot, met with a pe
culiar accident to-day. Miller was en
gaged in checking baggage and in the
course of his work came to a heavy suit
case. In an effort to reacn the handle
the baggage man tumbled the . grip end
over end. As he did so a muffled report
v/as heard by the other baggage handlers
and Miller was seen to fall to the ground.
An examination showed that a revolver
had been packed in the suit case and
was discharged by the rough handling.
The bullet struck Miller in the calf of

ADMITS CRIME FOR WHICH
OTHERS ARE IX PRISON
Reno Convict Thought by Officer* to
Be Trying to Aid Ilia
Friends.
RENO, Oct. 21. â James Burns, a con
vict, under sentence of fourteen months,
to-day made a confession exonerating
James Sabin and Tony Christie of the
crime of highway robbery. Burns
claims that himself and a companion,
named "Ten Thousand". Kelley, com
mitted the crime. Kelley, he states, has
Just been released from Folsom prison.
Sabln has been sentenced to thirty
years for the crime, while Christie is
under sentence of fifteen years. Both
men were positively identified by their
victims. The confession of Burns here
is taken as an effort on his part to save
Christie and Sabin, or at least arouse
enough sympathy for them to secure a
pardon.
His confession, uncorroborated, could
not be used against him. District At
torney Craig brands the statement as
false and says he will at once proceed
against Burns on a charge of perjury.
In addition to this he will contest any
effort made to secure a pardon for the
convicted men, who were captured by
ex-Sheriff Hayes, one of their victims.

SOLDIER INTERRUPTS PASTIME
OF HUSBAND BEATING WIFE.
HE RETREATS BEFORE I^fSTOL
Brutal Spouse Neglects v to Appear and
Bench Warrant Is Issued.
JAMES C CRA WFORD.
Police Judge Conlan issued a- bench
warrant yesterday for, the arrest and
detention in custody until; to-morrow
morning of Ferdinand -Bertin, proprie
tor of the Native SonÃ'.' Dyeing; and
Cleaning; Works, 480 Bush -street, who
failed to appear "when dus. to 'answer
the charges of assault wÂ£th a deadly,
weapon and discharging firearms with
in the city boundaries. , He: was admit
ted to ball soon after his arrest on, the
night of October 14. , :. .
Sergeant Robert Sherard, United
States Inf tntry, \u25a0is the chief complain
ant in th<Â» case. He was, passing by
the Berlin home when feminine shrieks
for aid emanated therefrom, and after
gallantly rushing into the . house, he
was confronted ,by a revolver in the
hand of .the masculine head thereof,
whose pastime of wife-beating . had
been interrupted by the soldier's in
trusion. Hemp unarmed, the son of
Mars beat as dignified a retreat as was
possible under the circumstances, and
as he did so. Mr. Bertin took a shot at
.him, fortunately," with Inaccurate aim.
Sergeant Sherard was in court and
eager to piess home his v complaint, but
the defendant's wife was not there, so
the prosecution requested ithat she, too,
be compelled by process of law to at
tend the trial and testify, if called
upon to do so. It was hinted by. the
police that the woman has transferred
her residence to Alameda County, sole
ly to avoid being forced to appear as
a witness, iso great is her fear that If
her testimony hurt her husband he
would retaliate by killing her.
"Well, have him here Monday morn-
Ing, anyway," said the Judge.
With the aid of : an interpreter ; Dong
Toy told ' Jusge ' Mogan j 6fV hqwf by *!the
merest chance he detected Alvlno,* Air
varado in the act of endeavoring to es
cape with the silken muffler and silken
handkerchief which he, had; purloined
from the stock-in-trade aforementioned.
Being naturally unsuspecting of guile,
Dong Toy alleged, he received Senor Al
varado with the cheerful courtesy " and
trustfulness that await 'any Caucasian
visitor to his shop. Tlie fact that Senor
Alvarado was seedy of apparel and fur
tive of glance did not provoke Dong Toy
to especial vigilance, for he had been
too long in the retail business not to
have learned that many an honest heart
beats 'neath a tattered coat and that
placing under rigorous a per
son seedily attired might result In the
turning /away of a valuable, customer.
So he gave Senor Alvarado free rein to
poke among the dry-goods .lying upon
the counter, and quite inadvertently per
ceived he hastily thrust a" muffler and a
handkerchief into one \u0084. of > his pockets.
Even then Dong Toy, said or did nothing
that could reasonably . injure Senor Al
varado's f eellngrs. Instead of â¢ openly, ac
cusing him of theft and thereby creating
a seene â to say nothing of . probably hay-
ing his face struck by the accused's fist
âhe quietly notified Police Sergeant Ross
by telephone of what had oqcurred.
Now if Dong Toy had ';. continued \u25a0 his
seeming, heedlessness of Senor Alvarado's
presence, that gentleman would * probably
have | remained long enough in, the store
to augment \u25a0 his ' booty and be : captured
without a struggle, but Dong Toy-indis
creetly : neglected to Â« pursue that \u25a0? policy.
Fearful that Senor. Alvarado might -de
cide to exeunt ; before ; the â¢ police", arrived,
he undertook . to keep \u25a0 attention Jen
gagedâand overacted the . part. Senor Al
varado, with suspicion -aroused the
sudden and. uncalled-for display of ef
fusive -j politeness, abruptly} dashed \u25a0". door
ward and succeeded In' reaching, the. street
ere the baffled Dong , Toy j could [shrill ian
alarm with â¢ his trusty,-;; whlstle^lUnforr^
tunate for Senor Alvarado the police were
within a few yards of ; the ) door , when he
ran out, and the "ensuing- chase was both
short and spirited. :*.";.- ... \u0084','
The goods were discovered \u25a0in Senor/Al
varado's pocket; : and to-morrow he will
be "sentenced for petty .; larceny.

"But", he' didn't tell me to stop^r-or if
he did tell me, I didn't hear him,"; the
defendant informed- Judge iFrita.;.
. ."Didn't you see me hold up my dub?"
the .complainant 'inquired.
-"I didn't see you at all," was the re
ply. ."Which side of me were you on 7"
, ; "Your; right side." ,' .; ..^i/
"Well, \u25a0. I can't see anything on that
side because my, nose shuts everything
off. lam blind on the right side." -,\
.He "spoke the truth" so \u25a0: far as his
visual/ defeot .was concerned. - and the
Judge\took his word for the remainder
of the/ defense and dismissed the case.
Patrolman "Nick" Bakullch's attention
was attracted â¢ by : comraotional sounds
emanating from a dwelling on Broadway,
near ' the County Jail, and when he en
tered the house his gaze waa confront
ed by one man prostrate, writhing and
frothing at the : mouth, while another
man sat astride him and stuffed, white
powder into his mouth.
"What is itâ attempted suicide?" ithe
officer inquired. "Has a doctor been
summoned? We'd better rush him to the
Emergency."
".'Tain't none of your business what
it is," was the ungracious reply of the
man astride. "We don't need no doctor
an* nobody, ain't goln' f be sent t', no
hospital."- "
"What's that stuff you're jamming in
to his mouth?". the unabashed policeman
asked. â¢ \u25a0 Â» . .' "
' "That ain't none of your business, eith
er," was the impolite answer. '
Then the man in uniform asserted his
authority. After ascertaining that the
prostrate man was merely stricken with
an epileptic fit, to which he ; was subject
at frequent intervals, and that the pow
der-administered by the other man: was
common table saltâ the officer placed the
impudent one under arrest and booked
him for peace disturbance. He was reg
istered as Ed Bchnelder,\.and Judge Con
lan ordered his dismissal.
Judge>Mogan, ; after hearing testi
mony, in the.; case of . John Curry, who
belabored "J." D.. Mauser , of 316 Twelfth
avenue Vwithi. a , cane, ordered that the
charge be changed. from assault with a
deadly, .weapon/ to aggravated , battery
and that Itrbetlfied^byf Jury' on Novem

admitted* that.- he thrashed -rthe com

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
SUNDAY OCTOBER 22, 1005
PREACHERS IN POLITICS.
THE supporters of the present municipal administration have
found it necessary to attack the clergy of this city, accusing
them of preaching politics, because they deprecate the prevail
ing lawlessness, vice and disorder. In doing, this clergymen are not
preaching politics. If they carried into their pulpits national issues,
and gave the weight of their sacred office to the support of free
trade or protection, or reciprocity, or anything else that divides the
two national parties, the charge would lie against them. But they
are not doing this. They are entirely within the limitation of their
function in preaching for a better moral condition in the govern
ment of San Francisco. On this point their testimony is good. The
clergyman sees both sides of life. He sees the happy and upright and
contented side. He sees the good effect of morals carried into the
daily conduct of the people. He knows the economic effect upon the
city of virtue in private and public life. He is aware of the value
of character, and when he drops theology and its rivalries of view
and its controversies, and enters into the life of the people, he weighs
at their proper merit the things that make for humanity, and mercy
and charity, and for the moral uplifting of the people. On this
ground the clergy of all denominations come together. They pro
mote good character, stand for the minimum of temptation and the
maximum of self-control and resistance. It is the habit of those
who decry them to make noisy advertisement of the lapses of church
members. They sometimes lapse, they sometimes sin. they some
times commit crime, and use their denominational relation to that
end. But none can say that they learn sin and crime in the church.
Xo man was ever made worse by going to church. If some trans
gress in spite of its influence, who shall say how many are restrained
and kept in the right way until habitual good character is formed by
that same influence?
The preacher sees the seamy side of life also. His office brings
him in contact with the results of official partnership with vice. He
sees the tears of the wife, and the wondering distress of children.
He knows the sorrow of mothers over children gone astray. He, bet
ter than any other, judges the official laxity which permits the lure
and snare to be set in the pathway of the, young. He knows the
neglect of public duty which spreads temptation and rouses the
sleeping tiger of passion and appetite, that it may devour character,
mar life and overcome good intention. So, when the clergy of a
city join in saying that there is something wrong in its
government, .that it does the things it ought not to do, and
leaves undone the things that it ought to do, their testimony is
good, 'for it is based on knowledge. It is no answer to demand of
them specifications and a bill of particulars. They cannot make pub
lic display of the sorrow of homes or the confession, of repentant
transgressors. It is sufficient that they know these things and know
their cause, and are able to publicly point it out. No one expects
the millennium to be brought about by the human institution of gov
ernment. No one expects that vice and immorality can be efficiently
extirpated from a great city. No one believes that mere govern
ment can be so effective in its operation that moral sateguards can
be withdrawn, and men be made wise, or moral, or temperate, or
religious by statute or ordinance. To expect it is chimerical. But
all men know that it is one purpose of government, indeed its pri
mary purpose, to drive vice under cover and keep it there, to limit
crime by its prompt and proper punishment, and to refuse to it the
right to influence public affairs to the undoing of the public morals.
Long speeches and hard words, threats and intimidation, will not
wipe out the fact that there is evidence of existing misgovernment in
this city; that the municipal administration gives its weight and in
fluence in favor of those forces that make for degradation and de- 1
bauchery ; and that it relies for re-election upon the favor and friend
ship of influences inimical to public and private morality. If the
preachers see this and believe it, what should be said of them if they
keep silent, in the fear that they will be accused of preaching pol
itics?
Are the morals of San Francisco in a healthy condition when
a Judge on the bench declares that 90 per cent of the criminals
brought into court are youths under age, or not far above their ma
jority? Has government no concern in that? Has the example of
evil, which it permits to be publicly flaunted; nothing to do with
such an appalling condition? Who can hope for the future of a city
when its government is so lax in the control of immorality that its
youth, the hope of its future, the material that should supply its
strength, project its influence and maintain its many institution,
are debauched at such a fearful rate as is disclosed by the records of
the criminal courts? Every thoughtful man knows that the clergy
are quite within their rights and their duty, when, knowing the con
dition and its cause, they use their pulpits and their personal influr
ence for a change. They are not dictating. . They are disclosing.
They are not accusing. They are exhorting the voters to support
the promise of better things.
CO-OPERATION IN RELIGION.
UNITED and concerted action is held by the National Feder
ation of Churches and Christian Organizations to be a de
mand for Christians of every name if the church is to lead
effectively in the conquest of the world for Christ. That organi
zation, which came into being in 1900, planned and promoted the
great approaching Interchurch Conference on Federation, which is to
represent 17,000,000 church members. It .will meet in 'New York,
beginning its sessions on November iÂ£ and work to effect a closer
religious co-operation. No organic union of denominations is to
be attempted. It is expected to be a practical undertaking because
it will ask for union without fusion.
Just at the time this great attempt at united action is being
prepared for, there comes a report that a recent article? from the
pen of Tolstoi, translated from La Revue (Paris) for the Literary
Digest, is to be part of the preface for a work he contemplates writ
ing on religion, in which article the great Russian makes a plea
against the plurality of religions. He speaks of man being born into
ihe various differing religions, and then when he grows up and
begins to think about his soul he sees on all sides faiths alien to
the one he was brought up in, "each of which, like that which he
professes, asserts that it alone is true and that all the others are
false*" "He can take only one cSurse and that is to pronounce all
religions mere inventions. * \u2666 \u2666 Satan could not have invented
anything more likely to destroy man." Tolstoi argues that all the
great religions are essentially one, and that the Christian religion in
cludes them all; that it unifies, explains and defines them; and he
believes they will all be â¢ merged in Christianity in five hundred
years.
Whatever may be the temporarily disappointing limitations that
actual results of the conference put upon the big hopes entertained
that its influence, 'utterance and action. will create- ah epoch in. the

Come, talk to me, list to my prayer;
You have touched Her soft hair,
Maybe moved a dear curl,
Or, perchance, happy wind, kissed her mouth.

What else have you seen,
And what else do you bring
Half so dear as this kiss that She sent me by you?
Not the faint, budding green,
Or the odors that cling
To the violet blue,
Are so near, or, so dear, or so true!
Say, soft, scented wind of 'the south,
Was my Love's not the name that you heard . â¢
From the throat of the earliest bird? _
Is it not of my Love that the breeze
Sings soft to the murmuring trees?
Don't you think that it seemsâ
Truly, don't you infer,
From the low, liquid whisper of half-awake streams,
They are dreaming, and talking of Her?
But, wind of the south/you are blind, you are blind!
To be leaving behind
Those eyes, and those curls, and that mouth!
If I were you, wind, I am sure I would blow
From the north, though 'the snow ;
And the hail and the iee -followed fast, '
And the sting of my blast- laid the flowers all low;
Though I blackened the buds on the trees in, my flight,
And turned the green white;
Though I laid, in a trice, \u25a0J^^: \u25a0.' . f-

GENESIS OF THE BOYS' GANG
Dorothy Fenimore.
SHOULD the boys' gang be sup
pressed? No, says J. Adams Puffer
of the Lyman school for boys,
Westborough. Mass., one of the great
reform schools of the country.
The gang. represents an important stage
in the boy's development. It has a vir
tue to balance every defect which It pos
sesses. The problem confronting us is,
not how shall we suppress it. but, how
shall we turn activities into good chan
nels? \u25a0 ; - .\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'"
What is a "gang?" It Is a number of
boys, three or more, who go together be
cause they like each other, and because
they dare ;do things when together that
they are afraid' to do individually. Its
prime objectÃ are activity and compan
ionship; its social standard Is made up
of loyalty and courage; its expression, if
left ungulded, is likely to become mis
chievous or even criminal.
The gang has the attributes of a sav
age tribe. : Its natural instincts are to
fight, to roam; 'itMs* curious," It craves
excitement, and it , has > strong predatory
impulses. :; If we accept the biological the
ory of. life we perceive in this fact that
the boy of. the gang . period Is passing
through a stage which is, ;in some re
spects, similar, to that of the tribal life
in man's ; progress.
Professor. Puffer estimates . that three
out of four boye belong to a gang. By his
statistics he supports Sheldon's .theory
that the greatest activity in gang life Is
f rom \u25a010 to 15 years of age. The siae of
the "gang; varies. Large gangs show a
tendency^to split up into small gangs, the
former hanging, around; the- street cor
ners, while the;- little groups split off
either" to do mischief, or to take part in
games or sports.
Usually the gang is a local affair, made
up of boys of the same neighborhood or

district. The favorite place of meeting is
the street or corner, or some crude place,
preferably a shed or coop, which they can
fix up to their own taste, and where they
can feel a sense of freedom and of own
ership. Country boys like a tent in the
woods. The boys' gang, by its own con
fession, hates a parlor or. a- nicely fur
nished room.
- Professor Puffer had gained these and
other equally significant data by ques
tioning and studying 851 boys who com
posed sixty-six different gangs. And his
argument, deduced thence, is that the
"gang" springs out of the natural in
stincts of boy life. Its chief- object Is ac
tivity. This activity develops into a strong
physical life. Out of the gang's social
characters grows genuine virtues; It cul
tivates a freedom In social life; it teaches
valuable lessons of Justice, self-subordina
tion, . obedience, loyalty, self-sacrifice and
courage. . . i
But, on the other band, it breaks up,
to a greater or less extent, the ties of
home, school and church. It fosters the
spirit of staying out nights, truancy and
running away from home. Lawlessness,
unchastlty and disrespect of others are
among its evil fruit.
, Our problem, then, particularly In our
cities, where the boys' gang is becoming
a menace to public safety, is not so much
the suppression of this institution, but its
wise direction and control; and this In
spite of the fact that there is more than
a grain of truth in Jacob A. Rlls' opin
ion that a boy is like a wolf in that It is
only \u25a0 when he hunts with the pack that
he is dangerous.
For, as Professor Puffer, and also Judge
Lindsey: of Denver, both of whom have
studied boys' gangs at close range, de
clared, the laws of the boys' gang are
baced. as a rule, on ennobling and not on
degenerate instincts.
Happy Igorrote.
! See the Igorrote. You do not . have
to look through any opaque sartorial
adornments to tee him. He is visible
to , the naked eye. The Igorrote is a
very happy indlviduaL " He' ought to
be happy. He does not have to pay
two bits every four days to get his
pants creased. In that way he saves
|22 75 per. annum. When he has saved
up for forty years he 1 can buy ; an au
tomobile on time - payments. He also
economizes ; by not buying pocket
knives, because he has no pocket in
which to put the knives. But the Igor
rote never worries about- not- owning
an auto. His motto Is "Sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof." He lives
the simple life. All he requires Is his
pipe and his pup. He smokes his pipe
arid boils his pup, and he Is not partic
ular about the pedigree of the pup. If
you or I ate pup. we would insist upon
well-bred poodle or . dainty water
spaniel. To the Igorrote a dog with
any other name will taste as sweet.
His only requirement is that it be dog.

Growing Burden

f {rnpHE Tltallty of the democracy it
I self rests to-day upon the- pop*
1 lar knowledge of complex Que*
tions hitherto left almost whollj
to the sociologist or economist. The re
quirements .of American citizenship In tht
mere matter of information are vastly
greater than they ever were before.
This statement in the current McClurVi
is especially true at the present moment
when the great question of railroad con
trol is in the focus of public interest and
every thinking citizen is facing the neces
stty of passing judgment on the proceed
ings of the coming special session oi
Congress.
The railroads are the prime creators oJ
the national" -wealth,' 'for their agency
made available the country's enormous
resources of soil, forest and mine. Dur*
ing the astonishing piling up of fortune!
consequent upon the sudden development
of these natural riches, the railroad's re
lationship to the national life has been
suffered to take care of itself, and it ll
only now that public opinion has taken
serious hold of the problem grown out of
this civic neglect.
The administration of the nation \u25a0
transportation has been entrusted to rail
road corporations created by the State*
for the service of the public. It la
charged that the men in control of these
state-created privileges have not dealt
Justly with the people, that for long they
have given individual shippers privileges
which do great injustice to all other ship
pers In the same Industries, with the re
sult .that fair competition has been killed
and the control of the fundamental nec
essaries of life handed over to aie fÂ»w.
It Is farther charged that in the course
of these practices the railroads have set
at naught the legal restraints that have
been put upon them from time to , tira*,
and to complete their power have en
compassed the corruption of State and
National legislators. >jj
"It becomes â¢ therefore, of the gravest
Importance." says McClure's, **to know
the exact truth In regard to these charges
âthe position of the accusing citizen, and
the answer of the accused railroad. What
are the discriminations charged; how do
the railroads corrupt politics; are their
combinations monopolistic; who are the
real owners of the railroads 7 And final
ly, are the present laws relating to rail
road* right or wrong? All these and
many other questions must be answered
i order that the American voter may
have a clear understanding of the prin
ciples involvedâ moral, as well as legalâ
when he is called upon to decide wh*t
shall be done."

"THE STUDIO." the name which re
calls that beautiful international mag
azine- of art and the delights its pages
have 6o often given us Is perhaps the
best preface word to conjure with, and
â¢o by the potency of the association of
ideas throw a epell of Interest around
the announcement that a new book
called "How to Study Pictures." writ
ten by the American editor of "The
Studio." Charles H. Caffin, is freshly
published, eye-pleasingly printed, am
ply illustrated with masterpieces, and
all ready for the most anticipatlve ap
preciation we can bring to its reading.
The author has therein given us the
rich, cream result that has culminated
from his lons work in art apprecia
tion and art criticism. After enjoying
this treat and thereby having our ap
preciative faculties nourished we may
account the acquisition as having pro
vided us with a continual feast, for now
every fresh outcome of "The Studio" or
other of the great art magazines will
be relished with a finer, more Intense
and discriminating zest. The author
has taught us some new lessons in the
art of willingly submitting to the spell
of letting the thought and emotions of
other souls, expressed in art' form,
sway our spirits .temporarily out of
ourselves and into widening sym
paLhy for moods, aspirations, intuitions
and communings beyond the scope of
cur personal experiences If shut from
this enlarging.
One of the first ideas Caffin tries to
influence throughout our minds is that
we must not ,too quickly judge a pic
ture by saying "I know what I like,"
for . such judgment and enjoyment
never widen our being. We remain
just as we are unless we try to learn
to like what others like, at least to
thÂ« extent of testing the esthetics of
the whys and wherefores of such alien
liking; but to grow we must consider
that the noted picture before which
we stand meant a great deal to the
artist who painted it, and we must try
to understand what that meaning is
and see and feel it from his viewpoint.
By tins patient a.nd unselfish system
our appreciation becomes indefinitely
enlarged. "Thus may we enter into the
life of the artist and reinforce our
own lives."
Charles H. Caffin is of English birth
and parentage. He is a graduate of
Oxford. He came to this country in
lSSi'. The World's Columbian Expo
sition owed some of its beauty to him,
as he was associated with the decora
tion department. His art work since
ISS7 as a lecturer and writer has been
done in New York. He is a youngish
and strong looking man, with an eag
erly thoughtful face, a dimpled chin
th^t makes the face prettily attractive
without in the least effeminating it,
and he has black, heavy, handsome,
wide apart eyebrows (that contrast
strikingly and pleasingly with the
tfoad white forehead that spreads
above them. He wears a ringer zing,
and he may be pardoned for that only
provided It was the love gift of a wo
man; otherwise it is an offense against
the soul of the art of personal adorn
ment no (true art lover should be
guilty of.
As to his work, it is artistic enough
to itself recommend him as a probably
capable writer on art subjects, with
some of the plus of enthusiasm without
which mere technical knowledge would
be nothing to the wide public who want
to know about art, not with intent of
trying to do masterpieces, but with the
Intense wish to sensibly appreciate
them when they are done by gifted
others. It would be an unappreciative
omission not to observe, as we page by
page enjoy his volume, that he is him
self exercising art talent as he tells us
about the masterpieces of the great ar
tists, and elucidates to us what these
men were trying to do and their meth
ods of putting some of the best of their
Individuality on canvas to the profit
and delight of unknown thousands of
appreciators. His way of doing his
work Is masterfully, illuminating and
Impressive. He has much of the super
lative art of condensation, which. In
stead of losing aught by its brevity,
makes the few things we have time to
intently consider all the more plain and
lustrous by the elimination of what would
be confusion-cramming to those who
must hurriedly read. Condensation Is
the especial need of the age, for the
sweep of human knowledge of the past
and the flood of incoming information
of the present Is too vast for long con
tinued attention to be given to any one
branch that is outside one's specialty;
and even art knowledge, to most of us,
must be caught on the fly, or. else its
preciousness let slip our mental grasp.
In th* matter of art knowledge it would
be difficult to find a book that would
supply this need of a condensed survey
of the mountain peaks of It more
swiftly and effectively than Caffin's
summary.
He has worked by an original and
unique plan. After the introduction,
every one of the book's twenty-nine
chapters considers the works of two
great masters by the method of com
parison. A full-page copy of a picture
by each of these two masters Is placed
Eide by side to illustrate each chapter.
It Is an attention-fixing plan of point
ing- out relative defects and excellences;
but by far the best effect. Intended and
succeeded in. is the making manifest
the different ways In which artistic tal
ent praise-worthily displays Itself.
CaSn is not bo much bent on saying
this man's work Is better than that
one's as be is In showing how infinitely
varied are the ways in which men can
do flne work without confllctlngly ri
valing each other, . or making odious
comparisons an ingredient of all-round
appreciative comparison. When you
read It you will note that it Is one of
the best books for polntlngr out the
value of Individuality that you have
had the pleasure of appreciating. After
the necessary groundwork and founda-"
tlon of any art Is learned, then, crbove
that required but comparatively medi
ocre merit, the surplusage of value
comes In almost direct proportion to
measure of individuality there is in
the advance toward perfection.
That is a feature wherein the creative
power showed Itself most., beneficent in
giving creative talent to human creatures.
One of the strongest and most pleasing
Impressions Caffin's book leaves upon the
mind Is that differentiation in both the
fields of endeavor and In the personal
gifts that are to be Improved by each
artist seeking to be his own God-made
self, and not 1 a direct imitator, . or con
flicting rival, of any body. That is the
only way in which the true distinction
that is called style can be attained. The
great French artist Delacroix said: "This
famous thing, the Beautiful, must beâ
every one says so â the final aim of art.
â¢ â¢ â¢ There is no recipe by. which one
can attain to what is Ideally beautiful.
Style depends solely upon the free and
original expression of each master's
peculiar Qualities"; and Cafiin adds, in
italics, "upon Individuality *In fact."
Beautifully and clearly his work, and his
own unique methods of work, bring out
this thought and make us understand how
the masterpieces of the masters reveal
the principle. He shows us how one
great impulse of art movement followed
another; "all of them involving truth, but
none of them involving the whole truth;
in fact, that the manifestations of paint
ing are wide and various as human na
ture. From this study, also, we should
have discovered that the enjoyment to
be derived from pictures is not only the
satisfaction of our own predilections, --f
what most appeals to. ourselves individu
ally, but the interest to be gained from
studying pictures as the record of the
feeling and experience of other minds."
This sweeping study of the artists ex
tends from Cimabue and Giotto in the
thirteenth century ,to the Frenchman
Claude Monet, master ot the modern
"pointilllste" method of getting the best
luminary effects of painting. Only a few
samples of what he has to say can be
given from this immense field. Some of
the most interesting things he has to
tell us are about the painter poets, the
men who after perfecting their technlc
and. correctly showing us the material
form and color of beautiful and Interest
ing objects and scenes, went beyond that
and tried to reveal to us their Impres
sions of the soul of things hidden within
the physical symbolsâ flowers, valleys,
trees, water, mountains and women, by
which the universal unseen spirit sug
gests to our senses hints or the grandeurs
and beauties of the as yet unknowable.
I will select as samples just two of
the masters and masterworks he writes
about. One, the great Leonardo da
Vinci, of the fifteenth century, and his
world-famous picture of a womanâ the
â¢Monna Lisa; and the other the foremost
living artist of Japan, Hashimoto Gaho,
and bis picture of a mountain. No one
can be surprised that Leonardo sought
to discover for himself and to reveal to
us some of the mystery of the unseen
universal spirit by studying in all its
moods, and then painting, the face of
the woman who had so fascinated his
temperamental love of the elusive; but
many will be astonished to know that
i-ie greatest exponent of Japanese art
meant to reveal by his mountain scene
a part of the soul of that same unseen
universal spirit. Artists and art critics
can hardly remind us too often to notice
that Monna Lisa of the all-comprehend
ing expression, who looks down upon us
and smiles as if God, via her intuitions,
had told her absolutely everything about
us, and all about the people we like and
love, and about the whole world; she
whose spirit has analyzed every bliss and
every pain and synthesized the whole
into a serene philosophy. She cannot tell
us all she knows, but it is enough for us
to spiritually see that the soul of her has
guessed the answer to the enigma, of life,
and that, knowing it, she smiles. Here
is a part of wnat Caffln says of Leonardo :
How subtle Leonardo's effects were may be
noted In tha lovely mysteries of the virgin
and angel. The latter belong to the same type
as his portrait of Moons, Lisa; oval faces with
broad, high foreheads; dreamy eyÂ«s beneath
droopir.tr lids; a emlle very sweet and a littla
gad, with a suggestion of conscious superiority.
For, as be searched nature for her mysteries,
so he scanned the face of woman to discover
the Inward beauty that was mirrored in the
outward. Ha ma 4Â« woman the symbol of
what beauty and the search for beauty meant
to himself, adding that Infinitesimal touch of
soornfulness in acknowledgment that, after
all his striving to know and capture beauty,
its deepest secret eluded him.
Speaking of Hashimoto. Gaho' s "Sunrise on
the Horal," he says: .
Japanese painting has already taught . our
Western artists a good deal; it has a further
lesson for all of us. if only In the matter of
simplification. How little there is in this pic
ture and yet how choice and meaningful the
details that are Introduced.

OLD SHAW NOVEL
IS REPUBLISHED
About the only, reason or excuse for
writing a review of "The Irrational
Knot" is that George Bernard Shaw
wrote It, He being the freakiest clever
man now In the literary field, the public
not only want to know what he Is doing
now. but what he did a quarter century
ago. Hence the venture of publishing
the novel. "The Irrational Knot" was
written In 1880, when Shaw was only 24,
the "second novel of his nonage," he calls
it; and he hasn't got over the nonage
of being brilliantly nonsensical yet, and
no doubt his years of full discretion are
not to come till he has passed a long
spell In purgatory. It Is men like George
Bernard Shaw who make the doctrine of
purgatory seem so conveniently reason
able. What else can be done with them
but . to put them to their purgation In some
Intermediate -place betwixt hell and
heaven? Was ever the gift of gold bright
talents so trifled with by Its possessor as
to deserve their exchange by some leger
demain of destiny Into i gilt , tricks , and
counterfeits, as Shaw .does with his, and
deserves? . . : , V ffJ
One other reason for mentioning the
story is that Mrs. Annie Besant once
published It In a small serial ' propagan
dist magazine... Did that theosophlst ever
THE SANvFRANGISCOVGALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1905.
expect to see the Knot reincarnated in
book form after a quarter century of
burial? Her one-time use of it is some
pique to curiosity to know what the boon's
about The author of "Man and- Super
man" and the "Plays Pleasant and Un
pleasant" is, of course, entitled to have
some attention paid to what he signs his
name to; and since Mr. Comstock of the
Society for the Suppression of Vice has
decided to Investigate Mr. Shaw and all
his works, with a veiw to finding out if
the said works are good enough rb go on
the open shelves of the \ New York Pub
lic library, it is well-to have-all- his^ writ
ings put into shape so Mr. Comstock can
peruse them conveniently. Let the presi
dent of the S. 8. V. beware, lest the vice
of vengeance make him condemn Shaw
just because that bright Irishman be
thought him to Invent the word Com
stockery . and use it contemptuously.
Vengeance of that kind might act'adver
tisingly to the boosting benefit of the
man he wished to level, and bo make
mountains of molehills.
Shaw seems from his preface to the
"Irrational Knot" to appraise "Man and
Superman" . as his greatest work. It
must be admitted that even to make a
good suggestion as to how the Superman
is to be evoluted is a brilliant and com
mendable deed,*and If Shaw's method Is
not the most perfect it certainly is the
most likely to be feasibl<3 â to let the
women have a free hand In arranging
it. But the librarian in New York says
that young ladies, if they picked up
Shaw's works, would, after reading a
few pages, throw them down with a
yawn. So. if that be true, alas for thp
coming of the Superman. If the ladies
won't even read witty skits about the
process of producing him by Imperious
feminine selection, then certainly the
Jig is up, for the State cannot order
such a thingâ woman being too stiSb
born to undertake reform except on
her own Initiation. Moreover, the
world won't, take Shaw, seriously* even
when it reads him, and so the coming
of the Superman Is Just an idle dream.
However, the author who proposed
him and Invented a method of evolving
may be entitled to a reading of his
"Irrational Knot,''
The Irrational knot, as probably
everybody knows, Is the matrimonial
tie. The novel contains no' scandalous,
nihilistic recommendation of the abolish
ment of marriage, albeit the people who
get married in the book were not happy.
No more were those couples who, lived
together without the sanction of mar
riage. An unhappy wife elopes and
finds the Ilais6n as unhappy as the
legal tie. If any unstated moral Is to
be drawn from the novel it seems to be
that the complete freedom of. absolute
St. Paullan celjbacy Is the wise way
to avoid Irrational knots. .
Shaw writes a preface In which he
virtually says of his own story that It
is not worth recommending, and then
In a P. S. he changes all that by com
mending his youthful production, , say
ing the morality, of It vis; original and
not "ready made," and, -"how this qual
ity Is the true diagnostic of the first
order In literature, and indeed , In all
arts, including the' art of life." --:, He

person, but as "a perion , with a moral^

TELLS THE STORY
OF HER STRUGGLE
The best way in which to get in
structively interested In the new
anonymous book, called "The Long,
Day," Is to read the epilogue first.
That quickly . makes you realize the
importance of the story upon- which, it
is a closing discourse. Really that epi
logue is a sociological essay and a very
good one; written; by a working girl
who studied the;- conditions of which
she discourses from two viewpoints and
from two points of vantage. First she
was. a toller among the women, who
toll. In tho; drudgery,^ underpaid sense
of tolling, and, second, having lifted
herself by her own energy to a better
position, she studied science and eco
nomics, added to that a wide but sys
tematic reading, and then, with that
larger intelligence, stie went over .the
ground again to . investigate the . eco
nomics of | that particular phase of life
in which she had been a suffering par
ticipant.
The book is the true, story of a New,
York^ working girl as told by herself.
The author gives no: hint of , her name i
nor identity, but, at the suggestion of :\
one of her humble work- companions
Bhe. took,: for the occasion of one Job,
the name of "Rose Fortune, so we can
call her' that for convenience while she
keeps her anonymity. The story bears
the stamp of genuineness. It la sent
out "by the Century Company as be
ing what it purports to be/ and the*
author says of herself: ."And mow a
word as to : the verity of this, narra
tive. Have I actually been through all
that I have described? Yes, and more;
and \u25a0. In other, cities besides New York.",
"But," says the thoughtful "reader,
"do'your; sordid experiences of "two or
three years .ago. match | conditions 7of
to-day?" and I answer: - "Generally
speaking they, do,' because lately: I re
inforced memory by thorough investi
gation." '\u25a0-. \u25a0 "'\u25a0 .-..\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0. --'\u25a0:.â¢ â¢\u25a0; : <S ; ' - '

it " met "with a T ( very.; cleverly resentful 'bit

workmateshlp ;. ;; upon \u25a0 '' girls V.who. who -' hiimp
themselves t? because *,they a ; have $ to-^-f or,
dear! life ' and ) bread and "\u25a0 butter." /And Vail
w s i with; the' air (of; onelwlth'jriucht bet- J
ter grammar, superior refinement, better
i education, and general kindly condescen
sion to a lower breed of humans. That's
Just the vaguely recalled substance of the
thing; I wish I could remember exactly
the way the woman expressed It. It
was an exquisite bit of semi-restrained
sarcasm, with just bitterness enough to
give : a tang to it as rich as the finest
quality of imported Chinese ginger. It
does you .good to hear an energetically
exasperated woman go off explosively j
like that even when you know she is only
uttering half-truths- and will much mol
lify her opinions as soon as her mad is
all blown out. The working women who
I feel like that critic did need have no fear
that :the '.Long Day" was written by a
masquerader; it is done by a girl who
has been through the mill In a bona fide
way, and bitterly wept some of the un
derpaid, overworked, stintlngly fed and
sordidly lodged toiler's griefs, both for
herself and for the sympathy of actual
fellowship in misfortune. \u25a0
The title of "The Long Day" may be
slightly misleading, in that it was many
long days of exhausting toil and uncer
tainty of the future. Six months Rose
Fortune struggled with poverty and the
problem of making an honest living. She
had to be thankful for wages of from
three to four dollarts a week, and could
barely keep body and soul together with
the meager sum. She graphically de
scribes the people she was thrown in con
tact with. It is fine just as a story of a
young country girl's experiences in a big
city, and it Is still finer as a sociological
study. It is valuable, in that it not only
points out evils, but- Intelligently sug
gests the right remedies.' Although this
woman writer has a .deep sympathy for
the working, girls of 'a big city, she does
not hesitate to ; lay bare her experience
that there jis a j large amount lof moral
toughness among them.' The jokes that
are joked and the stories that are list
ened to across the work tables revealed
to her the omnipresence of this coarse
ness. She uses stronger adjectives In re
porting It. than I. will. .This is Just a part
of the serious work she Is aiming to do.
She does not ,want merely to help the
toilers to earn more'money; she. wants to
lift them morally and educationally. . It
is something of an all-around. sociological
study, and when she reports what she
raw wrong, \u25a0she tells how improvements
could be made. She believes the work-
Ing women would be greatly helped by
trades unionism. If they would go Into" It
more. She deplores the lack of accuracy
In I the -beginnings of education the girls
have | received. Their taste In literature
she notes' is execrable, and the only rem
edy she can see for that Is to give them
the choice things right from their child
hood days of reading fairy tales. / Kindly
lntentloned philanthropists have tried to
Introduce the i choicest of works among
the young women, but they fail to be
come Interested in" what Is thus pro
vided. . :.: \u25a0'\u25a0':' \u25a0 '.' '/- \u25a0 v <\
-The 'strongest thing In the book Is.the
expression of the belief that the Christian
church Is r the one all-potent thing that
can cure the evils that the working girls
have to contend with, both those .of out-,
ward conditions and of .Inward will. Next
to this expression of combined confidence
in the power of ' the : church and _ severe
criticism of It , for falling to take a more
democratic grasp and get In work more
nearly equal to Its opportunities, the most
worthy thing In the book Is what â¢It tells
the girls : they f must do \u25a0;; for. themselves.
That feature, and the way It Is worked
out i by i precepts' . stated and examples
given; is j the finest) art : of: the i story. It
takes the ample space of pages to develop
and'enforce this thought. >i Go ,to the book
and get that, its leading Idea. Into your

DARKY MELODIES
WELLILLUSTRATED
Paul Laurence Dunbar, the negro
poet, has put forth another collection
of his verses. They are all in planta
tion dialect, and the Illustrations are
from photographs of old-fashioned
darkles. This collection of pictures Is
very good and makes the book worth
while just for that. The title Is that
well known and well beloved darky
greeting. -"Howdy. Honey, Howdy!"
The picture on the back of the book
and just under the title is of a bright
faced black woman, with a kindly, welcom
ing smile, and standing in a doorway with
her hand extended all ready for a
warm-hearted shake to some expected
visitor. It Is very attractive and re
mindful of how good the Southern
I "Howdy" sounds; and It makes you
want to gQ right In and listen to the
i colored people talk and sing. So you
; can go right Into the Interior of the
book and half imagine you have en
tered the old logc cabin. You will see
an old mammy In there that you know
well, somebody very like old Uncle
Remus, and an assortment of the cutest
little coons. Most of the verses are
cheerful, but as the. best of them hap
pens to be a sad one, I will have ,to
give an extract from that. Don't they
say that the sweetest music is ever the
saddest? )

OF GREAT VALUE
TO ORCHARDISTS
A very valuable periodical for the use
of orchardist and farmer is the Town
and Country Journal of San Jose, pub
lished by W. G. Bohannan. the October
number of which is. a flne example of its
merit. The paper is a continuation of
The Pacific Tree and Vine, which was so
ably edited by that enthusiastic student
of horticulture, Mr. Bralnard, until the
time of his death. The Tree and Vine
was founded In 1884, and was a leading
authority on orchard and vineyard sub
jects In Santa Clara Valley. The new
journal Is much enlarged, and it has the
valuable assistance, |as associate editor,
of the widow of Mr. Bralnard of the Tree
and Vine, . Maggie Downing Bralnard,
who, during the life of that paper, ably
seconded her husband in making it meri
torious. She Is now, \u25a0in addition to her
work on the Town and Country Journal,
writing special' descriptive articles for
coast papers and also for Eastern peri
odicals. A very - notable article of hers
was recently published In the San Fran
cisco Bulletin, giving an account of a
remarkable new variety of fruit, which
appears to be the result of triple hybrid
izing, a novelty that astonishes and puz
zles even the most experienced botanists.
The new fruit combines the qualities and
appearances of the plum, the peach and
the apricot, and the theory, of Its acci
dental production Is that the ovules of
the mater plum were fertilized by pollen
from both a peach and an apricot; the dif
ferent pollens ; both having an effect on
the product of the triple crossing. It Is a
hitherto . unlnvestlgated theory, and Mrs.
Bralnard. has probably called attention
to something that will greatly lnerest
horticulturists and prove very valuable.

CLEVER WORK BY
A LOCAL AUTHOR
Local publications by local authors and
artists, when *. they have merit, naturally
should attract some special attention from
the "". public"- The brightly beaming little
book turned out- by- Paul Elder called
"Teddy Sunbeam,",; â¢, written Iby . . Grace
Charlotte )i Sperry, t and illustrated by Al
bertlne '-. Randall -Wheelan,; Is * well worth
that attention. \lt Is a collection of little
fables > for little , housekeepers" and gives
recipes - for both -beautiful â¢? conduct \u25a0; and
carefulj; skillful ' work,". In \u25a0 such a sunshiny
way ~ the * tiny . helpers of the household
will : learn them - gladly: ' The ) text ' is ex
cellently wise and : Instructive, . and the Il

broau.y, from the 'â¢ back : of the book, with
a broom \u25a0 and : a dustpan in his bands and
a dishcloth slung over his arm, you are
aware at once that he ia a willing worker
and will diligently hold up his end at
whatever there Is to do and never lack
alacrity. One of the test fables in It
Is the one named "The Violet's Tear."
It refers to the white spot down in the
heart of the royal purple of ue violet.
At day break one morning Pansy told
It to Teddy. She said she got the story
from Robin Redbreast. Teddy asked
Pansy for thoughts and shÂ« was In the
poetic mood and told him Robin's story
anent her sister flower. Violet. Robin
had perched on the tender tip of a flower
stalk and was looking: sympathetically
at the "V lolet's tearâ the only sad thing
in sight .on that lovely morning. He told
Pansy t^at the Violet's tears are caused
by "I Forgets," and It is the careless
children who drop them there. Violet
Is ever hoping that the "I Forgets" will
be overcome by "Will Remember." so
that the tear in her heart will be removed.
But all the beautiful bright days of her
life the little white tear, caused by "X
Forget." lies in her heart.

OF INTEREST TO
ALL BOTANISTS
Lovers of botany will be Interested
to know of the publication of two
very pretty new books on the subject.
One of them Is of special local value,
as It la "Popular "West Coast Flora;
an Analytical Key to the Flora of ,the
Pacific Coast," in which are described
ISOO species of flowering plants grow
ing west of the Sierra Nevada and Cas
cade crests, from San Diego to Puget
Sound. It Is published by the Whit
aker & Ray Co. and is by Volney
Rattan, curator of the State Normal
School, San Jose, Cal. It contains a
glossary of specific names and botani
cal terms and It has a number of cuts
and some beautiful full-page pictures.
Seven of the half-tone plates were
made from photographs supplied by
the well-known and enthusiastically
artistic photographer and lover of out
door life. A. P. Hill of Saa Jose. Mr.
Rattan thinks .that the frontispiece.
representing a Mount Hamilton speci
men of the rarest and most unique of
Clarkias," is probably the best botani
cal photo-engraving ever made."
The other work, Is "The Fern \u25b2Hies,"
by Wlllard Kelson clute. It has more
than 160 Illustrations by Ida. Martin
Cluite. It Is published uy Frederick A.
Stokes Company, New York, and is a
very beautiful specimen of the art of
bookmaklng. It has eight handsome
colored plates and a large number of
full-page drawings on a very flno qual
ity of paper. The author Is the tarns
who wrote "The Fern Collector's
Guide" and "Our Ferns la Their
Haunts." He says the drawings have
been made from typical specimens of
the plants and It Is believed that many
of ithe species will now be easily Iden
tified by merely comparing them with
the Illustrations.

Xew York Cotton Market.
""NEW YORK. Oct. 21. â The cotton market
opened easy on disappointing cablet and heavy
profit-taking. Very cold weather is predicted
over Sunday in the Eastern belt.. There is
lots of profit-taking, but buying is sood.
Frost advices were the really dominant in
fluence in this weekVs upward movement in
the cotton market. As the later advices from
th<? Southwest did not indicate any I extensive
cUtmag-e there wa s heavy profit-taking ana on
this part of improvement was lost. Much at
tention is now being paid to the position o[
the farmer and his ability to hold back cot
ton.
The ginners' report by the Government will

entire day. The volume of x business on the
whole was rather small. 'At: the opening De
cember was unchanged to %c higher at 86%@
66% c. Influenced by clear.' weather In the
Northwest and by Increased receipts at Min
neappolis and Duluth, pit traders were Inclined
to sell. Demand' from commission houses,
however, absorbed the offerings at only slight
losses. December eased off to 86% c. . Toward
the end of the first hour a firmer tdne devel
oped on covering by shorts. Â« Fresh reports; of
drought damage to the new sown crop In. the
Southwest started the buying. Another factor
that created some apprehension In the minds
of shorts was continued urgent : demand from
exporters for American corn and - oats. -The
market closed strong, with December up %@

"Receipts for the week have amounted to
S2OO tons. \
"Of the above amount a larger proportion
has consisted ; of Alfalfa Hay, stock Hay and
considerable of the poorer varieties of horse
Hay. The arrivals b>' railroad have been com
paratively light, solely owing to the scarcity,
of cars. If plenty were available" for Hay,
and .the orders for shipment could all be filled,
this market might expect to be heavily bur
dened with an oversupply of the better grades.
"The demand, lately has eased off somewhat,
as the large consumers are well stocked and
the local current requirements -have been light.
"Notwithstanding that- arrivals have been
very moderate, the market during the last few
daye has been plainly easier and offerings of
the various grades have moved off quite slowly.
"The export demand is rather; quiet', and
there is nothing In sight now to lead 'us to
expect any activity in this direction for the
near future. ; /' '
"It is only an occasional fancy car of Wheat
Hay that will command top quotations, as the
majority of all the Wheat and Wheat and Oat
Hay is of the medium 1 and No. 1 varieties,
which cell here at from $11 to $14 1 per ton;
choice tame Oat Hay will bring up to $12 and
$12 50 per ton. ,- - - \u25a0
"The market for Alfalfa Hay has continued
alone in about the same way as last quoted.

from the fields is now : being marketed.-â

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
.Local trade in fresh fruits was- less active
than usual on Saturday, v there being very little
extra buying for Sunday, wants because of the
cool weather.' Receipts of ' table Grapes were
light, but i there was no scarcity, ... the ' carry
over from the preceding day being large. Fresh
arrivals of crated stock so!U-for, export : on the
Puget : Sound ; steamer, out to-day, at slightly
higher prices, while ' ordinary offerings were
inclined 1 to/drag at easy 'rates. Large .boxes
were ' plentiful and easy, except for the btct
Muscat" and fine Black . Ferreras, occasional
sales -'of; the "latter belns "; reported at a email
premium. ' Offerings of Wine Grapes consisted
almost entirely, of odds and " ends. * which met
.with very little demand. ' Melons were neglect
ed " and' it - was - impossible to effect clearances
even at round .' concessions. - There was very
little doing in and, with stocks still
unwieldy,' that department was reported weak.
The other email orchard fruits were reported
eteady to firm, particularly Figs, which were
suddenly scarce. There were no" Peaches r<v
ceived and, as there are no more expected, the
quotations are withdrawn. ": Berries were In
fair request and top quality lota brought high
er \u25a0, prices. In the Citrus market Grape Fruit
and good Oranges were firm, while Limes were
easy at the: recent decline. A car of inter
mediate crop Navel Oranges was received from
the OJal Valley, but was not marketed, -having
arrived too late. - Some new crop Grape Fruit
came in . from Orovllla and sold at $3, $3 50
and $4 per box for 112 a, 9t>s and 80s re

Husband Says She
Stole All His
Is Reconciled to the
Loss Before th-
Liner Sails.
A Tew minotes before the liner Cop
tic sailed yesterday for \\w Orient a per
epiimg Swede appeared at ihe gangplank
and inquired anxiously If his wife was
on l>oaru. a woman fitting the descrip
tion hÂ« guvÂ» had r^seed up the gang
plank and Charles Swanson. the afore
said perspiring one. demanded that Po
llcerr.an Mackay arrest her. She had de-
sertod him. ht said. lor a sold:er %he was
going to join ii! the Philippines and had
takcj; -with her $200 -stolen irom him. He
â¢ had no warrant for the woman's arrest,
i: declined to act. but advised
T.-snson to st<?n aboard the Coptic and
teek the ruuway himself.
Swaason stepped, but the woman saw
him Krst and la a few 'minutes, persplr-
Ins more" freely than Â«ver, hÂ« shambled
â¢ down the gangway.
Ke had been married to the woman, he
paid, for ten years. After coming ashore.
Swar.son stood for a few minutes in deep
thought. Slowly he put his hand into hie
pocket, from which he extracted a well
worn briar- wood pipe. With ponderous
deliberation he packed the bowl with to
bacco. Applying: a lighted match to the
w^ed. he took two deep pulls at the pipe
and from the cloud of emoke he spoke;
"Aye lank thar bay planty more."
And .Swanson, resigned and contented,
with the perspiration rapidly evaporating 1 ,
walked away.
The Pacific Mail office papers were as
usual late in arriving and the Coptic's
departure was delayed in consequence
marly half an hour. She carried a large

WAYWARD GIRL
IS ARRESTED
Catherine Shaw," Who Ban
AAvay From Vancouver, B.
C, Is Found by Local Police
HER- COMPANIONS HELD
Two Men Found in Company
; With Her Are in Tanks
Pending an Investigation
Catherine Shaw, a pretty sixteen
year-old girl who has, run away from
her home at Vancouver, B. C, was ar
rested' at .the Tiburon ferry yesterday
in the company of two men who gave
their names as William- Morton and
Jackson E. Young. : The men were also
placed under arrest and the police are
looking up their records.
:The girl's father is Arthur Shaw, a
well-to-do storekeeper :at Vancouver.
Acting Captain of Detectives Harry
Reynolds has wiped to Shaw notifying
him that his wayward child : has been
located. -
-Though the girl' is" slight of figure
and has aibaby face, she has been
passing- herself off as a. woman of
twenty. Though her appearance belies
her statement, that she isthat old. she
has the self-possession of a woman.
When -first questioned by Detective
Reynolds; she tried to keep up "the de
ception,^ but finally broke down' and
confessed that she had- run away.
When she saw the interior of the City
Prison,' she" was still more repentant.
' Detective Egan saw the girl in com
pany of the two men at the Tiburon
ferry. Their actions aroused his sus
picions and he called Pojiceman Webb
arid the ,two were taken into j custody.
; The girl" said- that she had met the
two men for the first time that morn
ing and that they were trying to in
duce her to lead an immoral life.
Catherine is now. anxious ito get back
to her home.
"On," I just wanted to see the world,"
she says in explanation of her running
away. "It was tiresome at Van
couver."
Bombs, It Is said, were first thrown
March 24, 1580, on the town of Wachten
denck, In Guelderland. The historian Hone
says "the invention is commonly attrib
uted to Galen, Bishop of Muenster."

H^m Reasons Why
Ã¼Ãl^^M. Money
Until Our Patients Are Cured to
> Stay Cured
FIRST â We have confidence in our ability to cure all cases coming
under the head of our specialty, which is confined exclusively to
diseases and disorders of MEN ONLY.
SECONDâ We never accept a case until we have made a thorough
examination and feel confident we can cure it. ]
THIRDâ We do not believe a physician is entitled to his fee until he
. has proven to the satisfaction of the patient that he can cure him.
FOURTHâ Our fee is so small, being only $12.50, that we believe any
honest man will pay it after he is cured.
'FlFTHâ There are so many impostors and unreliable so-called spe-
cialists that we believe our methods will in time prove our supe-
riority and hence be the more profitable. t
SIXTHâ Our enormous practice, built up on these lines, proves the
fact of all our statements.
SEVENTHâ ShouId a patient pay us in advance he might quit treat-
"ment before being permanently cured, and our reputation would be
thus jeopardized. ;
EIGHTH â Should a few dishonest patients refuse to pay after they are
cured the loss would be only $12.50 each, and we could stand it
with more fortitude than if it were a big fee. J
NINTH â Many honest men without ready money might otherwise neg-
lect themselves, and thus become incurable, while our Not-a-dollar-'
until-cured motto enables them to take "advantage of our special
skill and pay. at their leisure. ~ X
TENTHâ Last, but not least, we desire to reach the poor as well as the
rich man, and by making our fee only $12.50, payable on ' such
easy terms,- we thereby increase our business and secure lasting
â¢ gratitude from thousands who would otherwise remain afflicted if
it were not for this liberal offer. â¢
All of the above reasons we are willing: to verify and praatically dem-
onstrate to the most skeptical. Our offer Is to you. to everyone, only $12.50
for a cure, payable at your convenience. In such sums as you ran spare.
Could an offer, be more seneroaaf It savors of honesty, it Is honent. Xo
/matter what your trouble; ls â If you suffer from neglect, . for want of
money or from unskillful practice â here is an .opportunity to gret the ser-
vices of a -.Killed itpeclallst, a graduate jjhysician. with years of ripe expe-
rience in treating complicated and special disorders of men only. It will
cost nothing to talk to us. and may be the means .of restoring: you to
health and happiness. "Why not call to-day ?- Our offices are very private.
You see only the doctor. If you cannot call, write for blanks, as we ex-
tend the same liberal offer to those who cannot call. In fact, there i 3 no
excuse for being disordered or sick while this liberal offer remains. It Is
a jrlft of priceless value, within the reach of all. Remember, only fI2JSO
for any disease except â¢ BLOOD POISON, which is the only disease we ask
$25.00 for a cure.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1905.
CAPTAIN GOING
IS A BRITISHER
Confesses .That, He Became
an American Citizen by
Perjured Oaths and Fraud
MOTIVES UNPATRIOTIC
Kelly of India, Nelson of
Sweden and Several Other
Aliens Lose Their Papers
Philip Hastings Going, master. of the
America Maru, has fallen Into the net
spread by United States Secret Ser
vice Agent John H. Helms and at the
request of that official has surrendered
his naturalization papers and his li
cense as 'master of American vessels.
In his application for the seagoing
license he swore that he was born in
Malta. He filed his declaration of in
tention in the Superior Court of San
Francisco in 1899 .and in February,
1900, became naturalized as a minor.
When he applied to be naturalized, he
swore that he was born in Ireland. He
never resided In the United States for
any great length of time, but served
continuously In the Japanese merchant
marine for efght years. In giving his
reason to the Federal authorities for
applying for naturalization, he said
that he did so because he wanted to
take over some property from his
brother In Tehama County. The loss
of Going's license will not prevent him
from continuing to serve as master fit
the America Maru, she being a Jap
anese vessel.
Axel Sunberg also surrendered his
papers. He was naturalized as a
minor. . He was 23 years old when he
arrived here on the Eurasia. His
sponsors were Frank Johnson and Gus
tav Holmgren, now under Indictment
for perjury in connection with natur
alization frauds.
Edward W. Kelly, a native of India,
naturalized fraudulently as a minor,
also surrendered his papers. He was
formerly master of the American ship
Mohican. Gustaf Nelson, a Swede, also
surrendered his fraudulent naturaliza
tion papers and his American master's
license.
Former Deputy County Clerk Wil
liam C. Raisch. indicted for issuing
forged naturalization papers, pleaded
not guilty in the United States District
Court yesterday. His attorneys will
interpose a demurrer to the Indictment
next week on the ground that it fails
to allege any public offense against the
accused. x
Antonio J. Santos, recently arrested
for complicity in the frauds, gave
43000 bonds before United States Com
missioner Heacock yesterday and was
released. His examination was set for
next Monday at 10 a. m.

SMALL FINDS AT LAST
MAN WHO STOLE WIFE
FARMER'S LONG SEARCH ENDS
The tlrele**, xelentlÂ«Â»Â» search of I.
B. Small, the Onvegu (Oregon) farmer,
for hi* erring: 'wife and her paramour,
John F. Grant, alias Thompson, alias
Slice, which haii carried hint over mcv
* ral States end Into dozens of hamlet*,
tonni and cities und has covered a
period of more than two year*, has
â¢nded at last. It has finished with a
battle bettreen the two men, but not
\u25a0frltn a homicide, as expected. The pur
suer located the fugitives l'rlrtay nUrht
ta Point Richmond, and the latter are
mow In custody In that place. That the
elorinsr chapter of the ions: hunt Is
not written In blood Is deemed extraor
dinary.
Small did not kill the man who
wrecked his home and took his wife
Mid mother of his four children away
trom him. It was expected that when
the farmer, whose determined charac
ter Is evidenced by his persevering
\u25a0ftarch, faced Grant, he would slay him
without mercy. Grant thought this,
too. The latter still lives, but he is
Tnlnos his front teeth, which werÂ«s
knocked out by Small. The latter useÂ«l
his revolver, but fired no shot from it.
An officer seized him. and he said he had
enly drawn the weapon to keep Grant
from fleeing:. How true this is Is
known only to Small.
OREGON WOMAN WHO ELOPED
AND VENGErFUI, HUSBAND
WHO TRAILED HER FOR YEARS
The search of Small for Grant and
the guilty woman who tied with him
Is a melodrama of real life. DetermlneJ
to find them, the farmer has never
swerved from his purpose, though lie
has bad to make his way slowly, work-
Ing: in many of the towns he visited to
earn his way. He had money to carry
him for the first few months:, but when
that gave out he was without means
save for what money he could earn
at any hard labor that presented Itself.
He owns a ranch at Cs-.vego, but this
had to be kept for the sustenance of
his children. He also conducted a small
hotel at that place, which was sacri
ficed.
COMES TO SAJf FRANCISCO.
Email reached this city In his search
on December 23. 13>03. His story, told
to the polioe here, aroused much in
terest, and there was great speculation
6.S to what he would do If he found the
couple. He declared, in reply to in
quiries, that htÂ» would not harm thÂ»s
woman. He only wanted to induce her
to leave Grant, he said. Asked if he
would kill Grant., he replied calmly
"Well* I never miss the lirst shot." An-1
that was all that could be obtained
from him on that subject.
Small showed circulars describing
thÂ« pair and giving his wife's picture.
HÂ« had had thousands of these struck
off and distributed all over the United
BUites at considerable expense.
ThÂ« description of Grant showed that he
worÂ« a blue-checked, fancy vest and
derby hat. had .< ""scoop-shaped" lower
lip and was "very talkative."
Grant. Small said, went to work at Os
wego as a section hand In December, 1902,
and he became friendly with the Small
family, ilrs. Small disappeared August
13. ISU3, and Small's daughter. Lona. told
aim her mother bad gone with Grant.
Small raised some money at once, and,
taking the trail, began the remarkable
hunt that ended Friday. He went to As
toria, then to Seattle. At the end of a
month he heard of the fugitive pair at
McMurray, Wash., . but they fled. He
heard of them once in Seattle. He trav
eled over British Columbia, Eastern
Washington and Idaho, everywhere tell
ing his story, that the blaze of publicity
might bring the guilty 'ones into view. At
the Dalles he learned that Grant was an
ex-convict, having served a term from
there for burglary. Small covered Mon
tana, and. returning to Seattle, took a
steamer for this city. Out into the towns
and hamlets of California he went from
here and visited New Mexico and Ari
sona. At some places he heard of a pair
answering the description of the ones
who were fleeing from him, but he never
came us> with them until Friday.
WOMA.V SEG.V AT XAPA.
About the first of January last year a
woman hired herself as cook to W. B.
Griffith, manager of the Coleman ranch
tn the Berryessa Valley, near Napa. Grlf-
Ith had read Small's story in The Call
S*nd he recognized this woman as Mrs.
Small. She confessed her Identity and
said Grant was working at a wood-chop
pins camp near by. She disappeared on
January 11 ard Grant left about the
\u25a0ane time. It was January 27 before
*-Â»Â«i Â«*n* by Griffith reached Small. The
The San Francisco Call.
farmer hastened to the place, but could
not find the couple. Patiently, deter
minedly he kept up the search. The pur
suing husband learned that his wife had
taken her maiden name, Wilda Parker.
He heard of her at Monticello in this
State, but she had fled when he got there.
Either the couple kept moving or they
knew each time when their identity had
become known and fled.
Small would get information at one
place that they were at another and
would go there, only to find the persons
suspected were the wrong parties, or, if
the right ones, that they had just left
for some other locality. When money
failed he went to work and earned suf
ficient to take him to another point.
While at work at his trade as a teamster
he looked at every woman's face that
passed and said yesterday that he has
examined thousands and' followed many,
j each of whom he afterward discovered
I was not the one he wanted.
Finally Small gained information that
led him to believe the pair he sought
wore in Oakland, and he went to work
there for the Ransome Construction Com
pany. While he kept his eyes open for
his wife during the day he also walked
the, streets at night in the hopes of com
ing'upon her. One day he caught eight
of a figure that stirred the blood In his
veins. It was his wife, but before he
could leave his team and reach her she
had disappeared. The half glance he had
caught made him certain that it was
really his wife.
FACE TO FACE AT LAST.
Inquiries gave Small a clew -which led
him to Point Richmond and on Friday he
went there and located Ihe pair. He then
got an officer and went to their rooms.
When the . door opened there stood be
fore him the object of his long search.
Small and his enemy were face to face at
last. Grant tried to make his escape
when he saw Small, who pulled his pis
tol, but says he only did so to make
Grant stop. He rushed upon his enemy
and rained blows upon him, cutting his
hand on Grant's teeth, which were
knocked out. The hand was so badly
hurt that he had it dressed at the Oak
land Receiving Hospital. \u25a0
Small was taken into custody at Point
Richmond with the guilty couple for his
assault on Grant and having the pistol,
but after telling his story to Justice Hull
was allowed to go on his own recog
nizance and arrived in Oakland at 3
o'clock yesterday morning, when he went
to the hospital to have his injury at
tended to and later to his room at 510
Ninth street. He returned to Point Rich
mond yesterday forenoon, where the
couple were to have their examination
In the Justice's Court.
It took Justice of the i^ace Hull but
a few minutes to decide, when he took up
the case, that the injured husband was
blameless, and an order for dismissal
was promptly made. Justice Hull turned
his attention to the . woman and her
paramour. Grant had nothing to say, in
fact, he refused to make any statement
in court; but the woman talked freely and
said that Small, while he had not been
physically cruel to her, had made her
life miserable. She said that she had
stood it until her two daughters had
left home and that then she could no
longer stand her husband's refined cruel
ty, and she left him. She said that she
had been happy with Grant, who had
labored long and hard for her.
PAIR REALLY -FOLLOWED SMALL.
The couple reached Point Richmond
about seven months ago. Grant secured
work with the Santa Fe and was pop
ular with the men on the road. -The
woman did nursing and was considered
by the doctors of Point Richmond an
unusually competent assistant.
Small charged both Grant and 'the
woman with a felony and Justice Hull
remanded them to the custody, of :. the
Sheriff. at Martinez ' until , next Saturday,
when their preliminary hearing: will be
held before him. V v
Small returned to Oakland last night
sad. but not disconsolate. At his lodging
house at 510 Ninth street he talked . freely
of bis troubles. "I love that- woman, 5

TWO MEN END
THEIR LIVES TO
WIN WAGER
Bet as to Which One
Would Be First
to Die.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Oct. 21.â When two
friends lay a wager as to which will die
first, who shall settle the bet after both
are dead and who gets the money?
That is the question that Bay Ridge
people are trying to settle. One man's
body was found a week ago and the
other came out of the river to-day. Both
have been missing long enough so that
they may have died together.
Henry Schwanwedel lived with his sis
ter in 1 " Brooklyn. u ' He was a confirmed
bachelor. When he settled up hia debts
with $150,000 that he had not had time to
spend, he tried to learn the trick of doing
nothing.
It was no use. Schwanwedel was al
ways of a hervouse '\u25a0', temperament . and
when he stopped work all of the symp
toms in the doctor books found him out.
He had to have some business, so he took
to watching his symptoms.
Not far away is a meter works.
Schwanwedel used? to stroll down there
at about noontime In his daily walk.
He would speak to the workmen as they
hung about the place aXter their dinner
palls werÂ© emptied.
One'day he found a sympathetic listen
er. : Adam Hillman, an engineer, was 20
years younger \~-arf Schwanwedel, but his
food did not agrroe with him. The two
men swapped symptoms and each, found
the other was a good comrade' ln misery.
Naturally, however, neither ;would ad
mit that the other was as badly off as
he boasted of being. Not many weeks
ago, the men in the factory say, 'Hlll
man was heard to call out: j
"Well, old man, I'll make you a bet
that I die first."
"I'll take you," was the quick answer.
The amount wagered ; was ; $600. Both
disappeared. The - body Qf one was found'!

KOMURA MAY BE

Peace Envoy to Be Deposed
From Mikako's Cabinet.
JAPANESE MINISTER TO GREAT BRITAIN - AND THE MIKADO'S ENVOY TO
THE PORTSMOUTH PEACE CONFERENCE. WHOM HB MAT SUCCEED A3
THE HEAD OF THE TOKIO FOREIGN OFFICE.
LONDON. Oct. 21.â 1n the event of a
change in the Cabinet at Tokio, Baron
Hayashl, Japanese Minister to England,
is likely to be called home to take
charge of the Foreign Office.
The . correspondent at Tokio of the
Daily Express says it is understood that
King Edward will send to Japan early
In the new -year a mission, headed by
Prince Arthur of Connaught, to confer
the Order of the Garter on the Em
peror of Japan. .
The correspondent of the Times at
Tokio says it is rumored that the Jap
anese Government proposes to increase
the army from thirteen to twenty divi
sions to better discharge Its obligation
with regard: to the Anglo-Japanese al
liance. . -
The Intimation that Baron Komura,
the Japanese Minister of Foreign.Af
fairs, is to be deposed and' that Baron
Hayashi. Japanese Minister to the court
of St. James, probably will be his suc
cessor, is of ' especial Interest at this
time. Baron. Komura' s diplomatic bark
was wrecked upon the rocks of Ports
mouth. Although he merely obeyed thÂ«
orders of his Emperor In negotiating
the treaty of peace that has Just beea
ratified - in* Tokio â¢ and .. St. Petersburg,
Komura Is, perhaps, the most hated
man In the \u25a0 island empire. ;It was
feared : for a time that: he would ba
assassinated on returning to Japan. It
is possible that : the great Japanese
statesman . is 'to be sacrificed by - tho
Mikado as a sop to the masses, who are
still clamorous over the. terms of the
agreement that brought to an end the
war In the Far East. .

Miss Alice Roosevelt and party will
arrive from the Orient on the Siberia
to-morrow. President Harriman.' with
his family and party, is also a passen
ger on the steamship, and a special
train will be waiting to speed East
ward with him at once. j k
Miss Roosevelt's plans are not definitely
known; but It is believed she will spend
a few days in and around San Francisco
before departing; for the Bast.
The Siberia left Yokohama at! 3:25
on. the afternoon of October 13. and,
as' tho steamship is trying to make a
record run, sh-i.is liable to arrive be
fore daybreak to-morrow morning. The
United States transport tug Slocum has
been placed at the disposal of Collector
Stratton to meet Miss Roosevelt and
party, and bring them from the Siberia
to the dock, and the tug Arabs will go
out to bring' Mr. l-iurrima'n and family
and Mr. Schwerln on shore.
Of course, the party cannot be land
ed until after sunrise, as they must
pass tho (luarantine inspection first.
Among- the leading officials in rail
road circles who will greet Mr. Harri
man on his arrival here are Julius
Kruttschnitt; .1. C. Stubbs, Chicago traf
fic^director of the Harrirnan lines; A.
Ij. Mohler. , general manager of the
Union Pacific at Omaha, and W. W.
Cotton, attorney of the O. R.and N. Co.
at Portland. Jt was at first supposed
a conference botvveen the president of
the Karriman lines and his associates
would talre plaje in this city, but from
the -request to have a special train* in
waiting: to spend Kast as fast as pos
sible after, tlm arrival of the Siberia
it looks as thtfugh the discussion of
affairs*, would probably take place on
the train on its journey Eastward.
The special train consists of seven
cars and will be perhaps the most lux
urious train that has ever crossed the
continent. Fearing that there might be
some mishap and that everything was
not in perfect order, the highest ofli
'cials of the Southern Pacific Company
yesterday took a trial trip in the spe

that everything w.-ts'in perfect shape to

the conditions under which their fel

form their duties.
It is believed by the letter-carriers
and sorters of London and the big
provincial cities that the system of dis
tribution is less laborious in America
than it is here, while It Is known that
American postal employes are better
paid than their British fellows, and the
forthcoming delegation^ is to report
fully on both subjects. Elevators are
not yet in general use in big blocks of
buildings in such places as Liverpool,
Manchester, Glasgow, Dublin and even
In London 90 per cent of the big ware
houses and offices do not possess such
contrivances.. In many cases when a
letter is to be delivered the postman
has to climb 100 to 200 steps. This phy
sical exertion tells severely on the men,
many of whom have to retire long be
fore they reach middle age.
When Austen Chamberlain was Post
master General, he promised to look
into the matter, but his sudden change
to the Chancellorship of the, Exchequer
caused the prievance to be shelved tem

his whole-hearted support, and. al

a fact that he Is paying a substantial

SAKTA ROSA LUMBER YARDS
DECLARED UXFAIR BY "UNION
Building- Operations In City of Rotea
Will Be Tied up Pending Settle
ment of Dispute.
SANTA KOSA, Oct. 21. â The looal
lumber yards were declared "unfair to
organized labor" at a meeting of Santa
Rosa Local Union No. 761. Carpenters
and Joiner s. of America, held last night.
This means that the lumber from the
local yards will not be bandied by the
members of the local union until the
matter at Issue is settled and will tie
up much building which Is now in pro
gress. During the' last few months
there have been a number of differ
ences between the union men of this
city and the employers owing to the
refusal of an express company to sign
the union scale for drivers. ' Each
time the matter has come up the men
have had to back down. Now It Is be
lieved (the fight Is on to the finish. '
The Building exchange decided to
night that 5 the members should go
ahead and Ignore the action of the car
penters' union taken last night In de
claring the local \ lumber yards "un
fair." This I means that all contractors
of this city will secure lumber from
the home yardi and if .the members of
the carpenters' union refuse to use It
when It Is taken to the jobs, the work
will be given to - carpenters who will.
*The Indications to-night are that there
will be a general tie up of all work
acre Monday. -->;|

THE SAN FRANCISCO. CALL,- SUNDAY; OCTOBER 22, 1905;
SCHEME TO KNIFE OTHER NOMINEES
TO HELP SCHMITZ AND LANGDON
DISTRIGTATTORNEY MOVED UPON BALLOT
Mayor Schmltz, in his speeches, advises
his supporters to vote the Union Labor
ticket straight. If he' is sincere in that
advice he is the victim of deception. Ruef 1
Is plotting to sacrifice all the'nominees on
the labor ticket to save Schmitz and.
Langdon, and the Mayor: takes orders
from Ruef.. The Election- Commissioners,
the creatures of Ruef, are in the scheme
to assist Schmitz . and \u25a0 Langdon at the
expense of other candidates of the Union
Labor party. ,
, ThÂ« Fusion Campaign \ Committee has
positive Information that the Election
Commissioners have. Juggled with the or
der of nominations on the official ballot,
so as to place Langdon,' the candidate for
District Attorney next to the Mayor or
second from the top.
According to the regular adjustment
which has prevailed for many years the
office of District Attorney Is eighth from
the top. It Is preceded by the offices
of Auditor, Treasurer, City Attorney,
Sheriff, Tax Collector, County Clerk and
Public Administrator. Some time ago the
present Board of Election Commissioners
fixed, the positions on the "ballot, placing,
the District Attorney eighth* from the
top. The printers were working on the
tally sheets according to that adjustment
A few days ago they received notice to
set aside all work and, begin anew with
the Mayor first as usual and Langdon,
the candidate for District Attorney, 'next
to the Mayor. Public exposure of the
scheme may compel the conspirators to
change the programme again and re-es
tablish the original position of each can
didate. Denial may be" entered that the
printers were ordered to make the change.
In 1901, and again in 1903, the bosses of
the Union Labor party knifed the ticket
to elect Schmltz. The same knifing pro
cess ia contemplated for the third time.
Langdon, however, is taken Into Ruef's
camp, but the rest of the ticket oan go to
the devil for all the boss. cares.
If candidates other than Schmltz and
Langdon doubt the 'accuracy of the in
formation given to the Fusion Campaign
Committee, let them ask the Election
Commissioners what is the meaning of
the juggle. Workingmen ought to Inves
tigate for themselves. ' Let the unions \do
a little investigating to ascertain if Ruef
is not preparing to give them the double
cross. ' ..
â¢'Inside news from the Schmltz camp, is
to the effect that Thomas F. Eagan,
George J. Berger. P. ,H. McCarthy and
Major Kyle are advising that Ruef be
sent to the rear with the baggage, but
the Mayor is so .fixed that he must take
orders from the boss rather than give
them. It Is isaid by ardent supporters of
Schmltz that Ruef's defense of the Mayor
and himself "at the recent Alhambra The
ater meeting \u25a0 will cause the loss of a
thousand votes to the Labor ticket. - .
Louis Kirschbaum of the Forty-fourth
Assembly District, an advocate of Par
tridge's election, offers to pay the ex
penses of another meeting at the Alham
bra Theater If Ruef will repeat his first
performance. Kirschbaum. offers to pay
the hall rent and hire a band. Four years
ago Kirschbaum was on the committee
from the labor unions that visited the
Columbia -Theater: and tendered .to
Schmitz a nomination for Mayor. Ruef
then gave particular instruction that no
one should whisper that Schmitz was a
member of ' the Republican Primary
League. A few days later Schmitz's
membership in the league was canceled.
Some of the grafters cling to the
delusion that the Board of Election
Commissioners' can go right ahead and
place the designations "Independent
Republican" and "Independent Demo
crat" on tho ballot despite a Supreme
Court ruling to the contrary. The con
temptuous question is asked: "What's
the court going to do about it if the
Commissioners put the designation on
the machine?" It Is the opinion of the
people that the court has power to. en
force its decree. The question will be
taken up by the Supreme Court next
Thursday, and if the decision Is against
the contention of the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners, Schmitz will not be
designated as a "Republican" or a
"Democratic" candidate for Mayor. It
is not likely that fear of landing In
Jail for contempt would Influence the
Commissioners, as they, seem to be
heading that way already, but j the
knowledge that officers appointed- by
the court would take charge of the
machines would cause them to make a
showing of respect for the law.
â¢ The Commissioners went the limit
when they appointed a band of Ruef
ters as precinct officers of election. In
that proceeding they ignored the letter
and the spirit of the law. The citizens
of San Francisco through the Republi
can and Democratic 'organizations have
adopted measures, to prevent the per
petration of fraud on the franchise.

Reports of District Coinmit
teemen Show Gains for
Partridge in Southside
If the enthusiasm that prevailed last
night In the meeting of the district cam
paign committee of the fusion party is
any criterion of results John S. Partridge
will easily fulfill his prediction of a 15.000
majority. One Democratic and one Re
publican leader from each Assembly Dis
trict was present and their ; report of the
progress of the fusion campaign was
gratifying to those at headquarters.
In the districts south of Market street
in particular Is the outlook encouraging.
The leaders from the labor strongholds
report inroads on the Schmltz supporters
of from 1 to 3 per cent a day, \u25a0 while the
captains in the Mission districts In . the
neighborhood of Partridge's home in the
Thirty-third, say that they are gaining
5 per cent of the laboring men who
originally intended to support Schmitz.'.
Ugly rumors regarding the intention of
Ruef to knife the rest of the ticket to
secure the election of Schmltz and Lang
don are having their weight in the shift
ing of votes to the fusion men. ,

of the various district headquarters and

The above district commltteemen are
busily engaged in sending agents through
the district to every house investigating
each name on the election rolls and pre
paring a list of challenges wherever they
find: that there Is an illegal registration
on the. roll by reason of death, removals
or other cause. On : election' day ; every
such vote will be- challenged. The most
complete system for the identification of
voters has been " arranged and the per
centage of illegal voting will be very
small.
Reports from the south of Market
street districts showed that a great many
voters had received Instructions from
Ruef leaders in that section that they
might 'legally vote in their old precincts,
although they had moved to some, other
part of the city and had not been trans

any such attempt was unlawful. r

TAWNEY OPPOSED
TO STATEHOOD
Congressman Says Time Is
Not Eipe for Admission of
Arizona and New Mexico
KANSAS CITT. Oct. 21.âCongress
man J. A- Tawney of Minnesota, who
passed through Kansas City last nighx
en route East at the head of the Con
gressional party that has been study
ing the statehood question in the West,
is quoted as saying:
"Conditions are not yet ripe for the
admission of either Arizona or New
Mexico or both of these Territories to
gether into the Union. I believe that
the wisest move for those two Terri
tories, at this time, would be to cease
the agitation of the statehood question.
Those Territories are not ready for it
and there is no use at this time of
talking about It.
"There is nothing wrong with the
people or the natural conditions of New
Mexico or Arizona. Both are enjoying
great progress and it is for Just thie
reason that I expect to oppose with all
my power their admission now. I be
lieve now that the Federal Govern
ment is giving them Justice in every
particular. Further than that, admis
sion to statehood would unsettle the
conditions there. Capital is not going
in there while political conditions are
in a transitory stage and with a chance
that there will be a change In the ad
ministration within the next year oi
two. or even three years. What the
country needs out there Is- this settled
condition for a few years at least: how
many years. I should not venture to
predict, though within the next five
years, unless something unforseen
happens, both of those Territories will
have made monstrous strides.
"Another thing I am lmmpressed with
is the utter impracticability of making
a single commonwealth of those two
large Territories. I can assure you
that no move will be made toward
statehood for Arizona in any form
whatsoever at the approaching session
of Congress. That has been decided
upon-" . ' r Â«s^'

TRAFALGAR DAY
DULY OBSERVED
British Celebrate the One
Hundredth Anniversary of
the Victory of Nelson
FESTIVITIES IN LONDON
Immense Crowtts Gather to
Pay Honor to the Memory
of the Great. Naval Hero
LONDON. Oct. 21. â In every part of
the British Empire, to-day and wher
ever a British man-of-war floats, the
one-hundredth anniversary of Nelson's
victory over the combined fleets of
France and Spain off Trafalgar 13 be
ing celebrated. On all the ships of the
navy at a given hour flags were dipped
while the bands played the dead march.
Nelson's old flagship, the Victory, still
lying at Portsmouth Harbor, was
decked from stem to stern with bunt
ing and thousands of electric lights
were strung everywhere for the night
Illumination of the old battleship. It
was proposed to Illuminate the Nelson
monument on Trafalgar square here,
but fearing the tremendous crush of
people with the accompaning accidents
the authorities would not sanction it.
In London the day's celebration be
gan with the hoisting of National flags
on the Nelson column. Immense
crowds assembled and when Nelson's
famous signal "England Expects This
Day That Every Man Shall Do His
Duty," was unfurled, a mighty cheer
went up.
The day was cold and threatening,
but this did not deter the people from
coming out to participate in the na
tion's holiday. Trafalgar Square, which
was elaborately decorated, was natur
ally the center to which all converged
and much Interest was manifested in
the thousands of wreaths from the col
onies, provinces and various cities of
the empire which were piled in im
mense masses at the base of the Nel
son column. Among the floral tributes
occupying the more prominent posi
tions was a wreath inscribed: "To the
Memory of the Gallant Dead of France
and Spain Who Lost Their Lives ln the
Great Conflict"
The column Itself was covered with
laurels, streamers stretching from the
top of the statue to the base.
The boys "of ,the Naval Brigade ar
rived at the scene from Portsmouth
during the morning and after saluting
the column by presenting arms, placed
on it a wreath from Admiral Togo.
Services which were all largely at
tended were held simultaneously in
St. Paul's Cathedral where Nelson is
buried, and ln other churches.
The Navy League took charge of the
celebration ln the afternoon and be
sides the services at Trafalgar Square
similar ceremonies were held simul
taneously under the league's auspices
throughout the country, consisting of
special prayers and the singing of
Kipling's 'â¢Recessional" and the Na
tional anthem. In Trafalgar Square
the National anthem was played by
massed bands while the crowds which
filled every corner of the big space
joined ln the singing.
To-morrow services will be held In
all the churches; those at St. Paul's
Cathedral being of an official nature,
will be attended by British naval offi
cers and the naval attaches of the pow
ers. Captain C. H. Stockton, the Amer
ican naval attache here, will represent
the United States.
As a more permanent recognition of
the centenary the Navy League pro
poses to improve Trafalgar Square by
Increasing the statuary and erecting
majestic fountains typifying Great
Britain's naval successes.
The largest dock in the United King
dom was opened to-day at Southamp
ton and christened "Trafalgar. Dock."

TALKS ABOUT
CHARITY TRUST
Andrew Carnegie Says Mil
lionaires Have Other Uses
Than Combining Wealth
EXPLAINS HIS , BELIEF
Philanthropist Declares He
. Has 1 No Use for the
Man Who Is Born to Riches
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Oct. 2Lâ Discussing with' A
ndrew Carnegie the question of trusts,
the other day, I told him that a certain
millionaire, once very closely associated
with him in business, had suggested the
formation of a> mammoth charity truÃt
composed of millionaires with Carnege
as chairman. â¢ Quick as . lightning the
electric philosopher "of Skibo Castle
flashtd forth, "Tell Schwab if I had
cnarge of his money he would have more
of it. They got him into that shipbuild
ing trust, which was wrong. When
Schwab sticks to business and lets specu
lation alone he is matchless. So he
wants me to be chairman of a charity
trust, does he?"
"We all do. There is an idea that a
charity or^ benevolent trust composed
of millionaires with your practical wis
dom to direct it, would heal many of the
Ills of modern humanity. What do you
think?"
"No. There is only one royal road to
success tor people.' They have to depend
upon themselves. I mean democracy
must help to save itself. It must not de
pend upon either class trust or millionaire
trusts aa a panacea. The trust of the
classes or castes has failed. I am the
very reverse of pessimistic; yet. If I
thought democracy were a failure, I
shoula conclude that there is no hope for
humanity. Millionaires have their uses,
but not for a charity trust. They should
use their surplus wealth for the highest
good of the people. If they do that they
have a raison d'etre and they show that
they are a far more noble^" institution
than feudalism. I have scant respect
for the millionaire who waits until the
Angel of Death has knocked at his door
before he gives of his wealth. He can
not take it with him. I believe some
millionaires would if they could."
"What do you mean by surplus wealth,
Mr. carnege?"
"I mean all that remains after you
have given those dependent upon you
<âc revenue necessary for modest and in
dependent living."
"I have read in The Outlook that you
have given away for various purposes
$133,532,000. Would this not be more
beneficial to the race as a nucleus of a
millionaire charity trust? "
WORKSHOP BEST UNIVERSITY.
"It. would not. Besides, you must
leave some discretion" to the unfortu
nate millionaire. If I have given li
braries and helped some colleges and
established an institute for research
and provided a hero fund and done
something- by.-way of pensions for
teachers, I have chosen these means of
helping" people because they seemed to
be best." â¢
â¢'What is better than a millionaire
trust?"
"Education. But let ; me explain.' A
young man intended for a business
career is better without a .university
education. I speak of the young man
who has to make his way In the
world. The young man born to wealth
does not interest me. -He- amounts to
nothing any way. The- basketful of
bonds kills his usefulness., .The "man
who has. to make his owii way should
go to work at 18. The workshop is
the best university, , The- man who
spends four years in the university
never catches up with the other. His
set ways and his pretentious superior
ity ares/hlndrances. I prefer the man
who puts on his pumps and goes' down
ln the mines rather. than he who stays
In the lecture hall and toys with sam
ples. University is all right for those
preparing for the professions, except
the ministry." \ .
"You would not have an Ignorant
clergy, Mr. Carnegie?" ,
"No, but ,the university leads them
to the higher criticism, and the mo
ment they begin that they are no good
for religion. As soon as they begin
to tear the Bible to pieces, good-by re
ligion. Bear in mind I am not prais
ing everything In the Bible. Some of
the fellows in .the Old Testament were
'rum 'uns' and I would not like to have
a son or a daughter of mine read about

BOON" TO SCIENTISTS.
"You are not opposed to charity, are
you?"
"Not at all, but I prefer to diminish
the necessity for it. A. proof that I am
not opposed to give a helping hand, even
locally, is this that I go halves with the
Duke of â¢ Sutherland in his . benevolent
works here. -And I feel. bound to say. that
his Duchess works -hard at helping others.
There ought to be intelligent competition
in the helping of our ; fellow-man as well
as in trusts." : 'V- ; , : '. '.;\u25a0 . . \u25a0
Oddly . enough the , above comes \as a
reply ,.by Mr. Carnegie to a somewhat
striking article in this";,; week's , '.'Public
Opinion,", to the effect that a fund should
be | erected ;by millionaires "to . which . a
doctor or lan 1 author/;, an ; artist* or -an
engineer, could turn in : the \u25a0 hour of 'diffi
culty. It would .be a boon beyond lvalue
to " some; good and true men , who ? are
fighting < adversity at the .same time that
they are ' trying , to ; carry. ' on their,' pro
fession. |In five j cases , out; of six Jthe
money would- be returned. aner; a period;
and it would be available for ..he assist
ance of 'others." ,i
An 3 the article; continues: \u25a0 "If -mil
lionairesi would -agree "_ to ; start' a ;. central
fund^fqr granting temporal. assistance' to
traders who could srive^aysufllclentand
proper, explanation ; as ?to .why ;; they : are
in need, a great commercial end ,\u25a0' would
bÂ« served. Many : hard-working and
honest men would bÂ« saved, and the
wholesale not less than the retail trade
\u25a0would escape, loss and grave inconveni
ence. If occasionally the fund were vic
timized by the rogue and the \u25a0 ne'er-do
well, there would still be the satisfaction
of knowing tnat the vast majority were
honest and deserving. The millionaire
would become the deadly enemy of the
moneylender, whose exactions do per
manent harm, while his advances only
do temporary good."

Southern Pacific to Build
Eastward From Utah Me
tropolis to Invade Territory
â¢ of the Western Pacific
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 21.^ â Confirming
the reports current In Omaha a few
days ago, General Manager Holdrege
to-day announced that the Burlington
would at once build to Salt Lake. The
plans involve the construction of 800
miles of road, including 250 in Nebras
ka and the balance in Wyoming and
Utah. In addition,: surveyors "now â at
work will seek to find opportunity for
a system of feeders reaching into the
rich country of Central Wyoming. Mr.
Holdregre said to-day: /
"The Burlington Company has for
same time considered an additional line
between the Missouri River and Salt
Lake, a legitimate enterprise that
would be well supported by the growing
traffic at Salt Lake City, in Utah, and
in the contiguous territory from Guern
sey west. It is confidently believed
that this line through the North Platte
Valley and through the town of North
Platte and the extension to Salt Lake
will develop sufficient traffic, to be of
no disadvantage to other railroads that
have been constructed, and that these
improvements will form necessary and
important additions to the existing
Burlington lines now In operation in
the territory west of the Missouri
River. Whatever obstacles may arise,
this -work, which has been fully deter
mined upon, will be carried through.
Construction is now under way and
will be prosecuted vigorously."
FLORENCE, Colo., Oct. 21. â The
Southern Pacific Company has twen
ty-two men at work In Custer
County, surveying a line from Durango
to Colorado Springs. William Ash has
just returned from that district. The
men told him that they were employed
by" the Southern Pacific, which road
would build an extension from Salt
Lake City eastward, coming 1 - through
Durango; striking Farmington, New
Mexico, thence coming northward to
tap the rich mineral deposits of Custer
County, thence ! through the Florence
coal and oil fields and to Colorado
Springs, where .Eastern connection will
be made with the Rock Island.
According to these surveyors, con
struction forces have already been
started at Salt Lake, working east
ward, and they claim it will not be
many months until grading- is com
menced in Colorado.
As the Rock Island, the Southern Pa
cific's natural ally, has Denver.connec
tions, the plan of E. H. Harriman, the
guiding spirit in. the Southern Pacific
system, at once becomes apparent. ; He
proposes to retaliate against George
Gould for building the Western Pacific
by going into Gould's practically exclu
sive territory and giving the doughty
son of the late. "Wizard of Wall Street.

.Prices That Mean a Substantial Saving
It is a well-known fact that our business in the highest priced pianos is very large, and
since we embody the high iqualityidea in our immense sales of new pianos at more .mod-
erate prices, we have great opportunity to take other pianos in trade.
Just now our stock in these pianos is'very large, unusually so, and we count ourselves
singularly fortunate in being able to offer such a range of makes and prices just in advance
of Christmas time.
For a 'Xmas surprise, nothing is more appropriate and nothing
could be more appreciated than a piano. It dominates all other gifts.
Of course we cannot enumerate here all of the different makes, .but when you call thÂ© pianos
themselves will tell the quality value, and we mention a few of the prices. what rm-e
A'ow Is the time. The finest harvest has to be promptly- gathered. We cannot ruarantee jr hat onr

INDIA EXHIBITS
ITS DISCONTENT
Several Meetings Held to
Protest Against the Plans
of 'the Curzon Government
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 21.â With the departure
of the Prince and Princess of Wales for
India that "costliest jewel of the British
crown" is again the object of all eyes,
and will be for much of the remaining
autumn. Conditions in the Middle East,
where Britain is mainly responsible, are
far from what London would like. The
Anglo- Japanese alliance may have re
moved the external menace for the next
ten years, but in India, as well as in
China., there is a spirit of unrest under
foreign dominance, and the boycott of
British goods in Bengal as a protest
against the division of the province is
not the only symptom of Indian discon
tent. If is hoped that the presence at
Calcutta and other important cities of the
dependency of the future Emperor ana
Empress of India will tend to mollify
the \u25a0 resentments due to the administra
tive errors of Curzon and the drastic
military policy enforced by Kitchener.
The arrangements for the reception of
the royal visitors are on a scale of mag
nificence never eaualed In the long his
tory of British rule. Nothing will be
left undone to strike the imagination of
the native potentates, and, as Labouchere
naively observed, they will .have the
added pleasure of knowing that they are
footing the bills.
Royal Dalaver. however, will scarcely
avail to reconcile the Bengalese to the
Curzon arrangement. In all "parts of
Bengal public meetings continue to de
nounce it. In four weeks nqt fewer than
300 have been held, and it is estimated
by the Times of India that more than
1,000,000 persons, principally , men, have
participated In ratifying the resolutions
of protest first passed at the Calcutta
town hall. These resolutions denounce the
partition as an affront to the Indian
public and as wanting In respect to the

COWBOYS CATCH
RUNAWAY ENGINE
One Bough. Eider Leaps
From His Saddle to the
Cab of the Locomotive
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CASPER,' Wyo., Oct. ZLâ A runaway
engine captured by cowboys was an un
usual Incident which occurred here yes
terday.
The engineer had left the locomotive
in the yards, but failed to completely
shut off the throttle. He had gone but a
short distance when he discovered that
the locomotive was in motion. He could
not overtake it, and It ran out of the
yards and down . the main line of the
Northwestern,' "toward Douglass. â¢ : *
When near Stroud, a station ten miles
east of here, the runaway locomotive was
observed by two cowboys on horseback,
riding along the road beside the track.
They* gave chase, and. riding at full
speed, one of them 'leaped into; the cab
as the engine passed.
Not being familiar with the mechanism
of the locomotive, he yanked at the first
lever he could see, which seemed to be
the throttle, but instead of turning it off.
he pulled the throttle out and. like a
flash the engine increased Its speed.
With great coolness he reversed the lever
and brought the engine to a stop.
With the aid of his companion, who had
continued to gallop after the runaway en
gine, he succeeded in starting the engine
back^ and ran it several miles. The wa
ter was low, and the cowboys not know
ing how to operate the pump, the engine
"died" two . miles from town and
had to be towed In by ano.tb.er locomo
tive. '
Had the engine not been stopped it
would have gone tearing through thw
yards at Douglass and might have caused
a disastrous wreck.
a suspension of the plan until Lord Mlnto
arrives and Parliament meets. There will
be a repetition of the protests when the
Prince arrives.
ENDS MOORISH
SULTAN'S RULE
ErencH and German Minjs
â¢ ters Depart Simultaneously
Prom Moroccan Capital
PARIS, Oct. 21. â Information has
been received hers that Count yon
Tatenbach-Ashold, the German Minister
at Fez, and il. Streno Taillandier. thÂ»
French Minister at the same capital,
are about to depart together from Fez.
This marks the practical termination
of the Sultan's direct control of Mor
occan affairs and the beginning of thÂ»
powers' assumption 'of authority, by
means' of the international conference.
The Franco-German accord stipulated
that both Ministers should withdraw,
but their actual departure closes the
Sultan's opportunity for further com
munication directly with the govern
ments through the Ministers.
'The result is not calculated to fulfill
Morocco's hopes, which were raised to a
high pitch by Emperor William's visit
to Tangier and the assurances of Ger
man protection. Reports from Fea
show that the Sultan has now recog
nized that the International conference
subjects Morocco- practically to the
same foreign control as the French
programme. Therefore he is deeply
disappointed at seeing the Ministers de
part and Morocco's future pass out of
his hands.
TANGIER. Oct. 21. â The negotiations
for the liberation of the # Brltlsh oflV
~cers, Captain Crawther and LJeutenSfl^
Hatton. who are. held by Moroccan
tribesmen, have been broken off. The
scout ship Pathfinder, which sailed on
Friday night in order to exchange &

two officers, has returned â¢ here from
Tetuan Bay. The bandit's brother Is
still on the Fathfinder. It is stated that
on the arrival of the Pathfinder Val

officer In command of the vessel was
unable to concede without authority.

time In XsÂ«w lork at ihe guest of. her
American publisher, and tnen go to
KXay wain tier friend, Kuic Douglas
Wis^in; at trie latttr's place in Maine.
To Miss blnclalr a bright-eyed,
nervous nttiÂ« woman whose accumu

iÂ»:i \u0084c; <-\u25a0â¢\u25a0- wie ilgure â her approaching
vieit tv i lie United States is lraught
tvithu Bpecial ipterest, for while the
uovel winch has' made hur name found
n.t:;j readers and admirers in her own
country, it has had by far its greatest
\ogue i:i the United States, where its
Qualities were lirst recognized.
"And I cannot say," said Miss Sin
clair, in talking to me recently, "hoY
gamrtricly i respect the discrimination
of Atnerican readers in liking- that one
of my novel*? â she lias published four
â "wtiich 1 personally know to contain
my best work."
This auihoreÂ£s' story is the old one
of success alter yeaxs of plucky fight
ing. None of tier former books â "Aud
rey Craven, " "Mr. and Mrs. Neville Ty
son" and "Two Sides of a Question" â
though the last-named was lavishly
praised by some reviewers in this coun
try- â brought her in enough to live on,
bud before the success of '"The Divine
Fire" changed the aspect of things she
eked out her income by reviewing other
jieoples books and translating. Now,
However, Miss Sinclair says she is glad
that success did not come at first. ,
"If it had done so," she said, with
characteristic seriousness, "I do not
think tnat afterward I should have
been able to write without being in
fluenced to some extent by questions of
ealabllity. But when book alter book
of mine failed I said to myself, 'Not
good enough, but the next will be,' until
now I feel sure that I can do whatever
I eet out to do, without being swayed
by reflections as to what the public
may think of the matter in hand."
Regarding her next book Miss Sin
clair will say little, except that she
rnear.s to start it shortly after her
return to this country, which she ex
pects will be soon after Christmas. It
tnay be finished by the end of next
summer. Maybe, because â as no one
who realized what an immense amount
of pains had been lavished on "The
Divine Fire' will need to be told â the
authoress is an uncommonly conscien
tious \u25a0writer, who finds no one less easy
to please than herself.
When writing a ~ook Miss Sinclair
commonly works eight hours a day, but
her output is comparatively small; she
gasped at the mere suggestion of a
thousand words a day. "I may do six
hundred," she said, "and I may do six!"
Miss Sinclair remarked, however, that
she had never been able to estimate her
progress by numbers of words.
'In that respect," she said, "figures
have not the slightest significance to me.
and if it is absolutely necessary that
my words be counted 1 have to turn
the work of computation over to some
body Â«lse."'
On the other hand, this authoress has
a curious faculty of being able to tell
within a few pages, at any rate, how
big a book the story she is at work
upon will make. "I remember," she
paid. "In the case of "The Divine Fire'
my publishers here got frightened at
the length it was assuming and de
manded to know how long it would be.
I suggested that they had better allow
for a thousand and ten typewritten
pages, and, though at the time I had
only' a general idea of what I was
goi:ig to make of the story, the num
ber of pages was within perhaps half
a-dozen of that which I had men
tioned."
Miss Sinclair also Is inclined to lay
claim to a sort of prescience regarding
other matters in connection with her
work. "For instance." 6he said, "I felt
Â«ure, though I knew nothing whatso
ever about American tastes, that my
last book would make its strongest
appeal in tne United States. Contrary
to what actually happened, I expected
that It would be a long time In finding
Â»n American publisher, but sooner or
later I felt sure of its success across
thÂ« Atlantic."
With Miss Sinclair It Is never a ques
tion of finding a plot for a prospective
novel, but a matter of selecting one
from the many that are continually
suggesting themselves to her mind. "At
present." she eaid to me, "I have the
schemes of no less than clx books al
most completely thought out, and the
vagne outlines of I should say twenty
five more are clamoring for attention."
Ordinarily that would be a rather
alarming statement, but In this author
ess' caÂ»Â« the rurvlval of the fittest

Regarding: the third piece. which she
has in hand, Mrs.. Ryley is disposed
to maintain silence for. a while. It is
hoped, however, ' that her return to
dramatic work, m&y be attended by .the
good fortune which wjis hers so long.

will: be Gillette's ; SB9th appearance in
the part. An item of importance to'the
multitude of Gillette's feminine admlr
era is that the unbecoming mustache In
which he has lateTy-disguised himself
has been removed.
Fritz Kreisler's only appearance in
London this season\came at a time
when violin recitals are supposed to be
in small demand, yet so great is the ex"
New Yorker's following here that the
big Queen's j Hall was | practically filled
last Saturday afternoon. Kreisler was
the sole attraction, and his undoubted

Theifault Hes,with the adapters of this
French musical play, which as the "Sieur
de Vargy" ran for over nine months in
the French capital. Its original story,
however, was a trifle too risky, for Anglo-
Saxon audiences; and ! as v often happens,
the wit of the v origlnal disappeared with
its naughtiness. 1 .\u25a0
London, is to have more Shakespeare
almost immediately, for Arthur Bour
chier's production of "The Merchant ot
Venice" at: the Garrick will be followed
closely by a revival of "As You Like It"
at the Adelphi. Â»In both cases successful
plays have been , transferred to make
room for. these productions. "Dr. Wake's
Patient," which has' been holding the
stage of the Adelphi. goes to the Strand,
while "The Walls of Jericho" has taken
up its new; home at the Shaftesbury.

it has three hundred and fifty nights or
more to its "credit, and with that virile

WOMEN DISCUSS POLITICS
IN EARNEST MANNER.
Suffrage Spirit Grows Strong at
the Convention.
talented woman who delivered an able address yesterday be
fopf the convention of the california equal suffrage asso
ciation on "the modern aspect of suffrage."
ThP hour of 10 a. m. yesterday found a
cojirmendably prompt assemblage of equal
euurage adherents in Wheeler's Audi
torium. After the pissing of preliminaries
Es to minutes, credentials and constitu
tional amendments, votes were cast for
new officers.
The incumbency of Mrs. Mary S. Sperry
as president met with absolutely no chal
lenge, for with Mrs. Lloyd Baldwin's
nomination of Mrs. Sperry was the mat
ter closed, her election being by acclama
tion.
The visible presence of ballots arrived
vrtui the naming for first vice president
of thrre candidates, Mrs. H. J. D. Chap
man. Mrs. J. H. Henry of San Jose and
Mrs. Nrllie Holbrook Blinn. The latter ;
withdrew and Mrs. Chapman won.
Inadvertency of count led to the awful
disclosure of sixty-two delegates for eixty
three ballots, whereupon Mrs. Sperry
suggested that stuffing was beginning a
bit too foon for the good of the suffrage
cause. And the pleasantry passed to
gether with the unearthing of its origin.
In quick succession came the elec
tion of Mrs. Blinn. second vice presi
dent; Mrs. Eliza Tupper Wilkes, third
Tice president; Mrs. Alice L. Park, re
cording secretary; Mrs. Scoville, corre
sponding secretary; Mrs. A. L. Corbett
of Palo Alto, treasurer; Mrs. Keith,
first auditor; Mrs. Allda C. Avery, sec
ond auditor.
Strong effort was made to retain
Mi s. Clara Schlingeheyed, the incum
bent treasurer, in some official capacity,
her untiring work In the body having
made her a necessary mainstay, but
those of the deepest regard for Miss
Bchlingrheyde favored her retirement
for a year to recuperate from heavy
pressure of work.
Luncheon intermitted most agreeably,
I o'clock finding a reconvening, when
the delegates listened intently to the
many enlightening points and argu
ments advanced by the earnest speak
ers.
Mrs. Horace Coffin, epeaklng upon
"The Modern Aspect of Suffrage," gave
a terse, convincing, clear-cut statement
of conditions with the varied view
points.
Dr. Dorothea Moore was not able to be
present and her subject of "Municipal
Housekeeping" was unexpounded. To fill
the breach Mrs. J. W. Orr gave an excel
lent paper prepared by Mrs. B. M. Baruch
of I^os Angelas.
The atmosphere of the day was marked
by practicability and decision. Every
move vas an achievement, speaking for
I rapid progress. Enthusiasm reached Its
climax during the speech of Albert M.
Johnson, who is a son of Grove L. John
son, his firm grip of his subject. "Would
the Ballot Help Women to Promote the
Different Interests of the Municipality?"
not only appealing to his listeners, but
strengthening their convictions.
Mr?. Frances A. Williamson and Miss
P.ird M. Wilson added good papers on
["Opportunities in City Improvement
Clubs" and "The Obligations of the Bal
lot," while the convention paid strict at
tention to the remarks of Mrs. Emma
Bhafter Howard. Harmony vibrated
through the medium of a vocal quartet,
the singers being vigorously redemanded,
and the session's close was not followed
by Immediate dispersing, for groups lin
gered, speaking of pleasant themes other
than matters political.
ALL OF CUNLIEFE'S

He R u rued Part of the
Money.
BRIDGEPORT. Conn., Oct. 21.â The'
Bridgeport pclfce believe to-night that
they have accounted satisfactorily for all
the $101,000 taken by Edward G. Cunliffe
from the Adams Express Company in
Pittsburgh and brought by him to this
city. la the opinion of Detective Captain
Arnold, baaed on his investigation to-day,
Cunliffe told the truth after his arrest
when he declared that he burned part of
the . money stolen, fearing that its pos
session would lead to discovery.
Mrs. Henry Clark, a chambermaid at
the Arlington Hotel, where Cunliffe had a
room while here, told Captain Arnold to
night that on October 11. the day after
Cunliffe went to the hotel. Bhe found some
black stains, like those of wet charred
jpai^er, on the carpet In his room, and also
found similar stains on the bathroom
floor, while the bowl iirthe bathroom was
clogged with burned paper.
At the time she had, no suspicion that
the charred paper had once been money,
but Captain Arnold her story
corroborates- the statement made to him

SACRAMENTO, oct. 21.â A meeting of
the Sacramento Valley Development As
sociation was held in the Senate cham
bers of the State Capitol at 'll- o'clock
this morning, â¢ preliminary to the irriga
tion meeting, arranged for this after
noon About fifty delegates from various
counties and municipal bodies and pro
motion organizations in the Sacramento
Valley werÂ» in attendance.
The meeting was presided over by Sen
ator Marshall Diggs of this city, W.
A. Beard" acting as secretary.
General N. P. Chipman presiding Jus
tice of the Appellate Court for the Third
District, and a member of the State ;
Board of Trade, made a short address
commending the for the work
It had done in developing the Sacramento
Valle/. X ,\u25a0 .
Governor George C. Pardee, president
of the National Irrigation Congress, was
introduced this afternoon by Senator
Marshall Diggs, who has been elected
president of the development association.
Governor Pardee was given a most enthu
siastic reception. He declared that he
not only took an active interest in irri
gation, but is a crank on the subject. -
Governor Pardee said the congress called
by the association is one of the most im
portant In the history of California. He
said he had recently visited Southern
California, where, stopping with a friend,
he found that the latter had sold his
oranges at $11 87. a box, or 12 cents each.
These oranges were grown under i"ls;a
tion Thirty years ago he had visitea
that section of the State and land there
was selling for $2 and $3 an acre. Irri
gation had accomplished wonders in that
section, he declared. '--r^f \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0Â£*Â«
"If anybody would tell me that here
in the great Sacramento Valley we have
not better waterways and a climate equal
in every respect to the south, I should
at least doubt the sincerity of the state
ment," said the Governor. , â¢
The chief executive of the State said
the great waterways of the State are
crying out to be placed on the soil of
the Sacramento Valley to multiply and
increase its productiveness.
The belief has been expressed by some
people that irrigation is supplementary to
the rainfall of a locality, but this is a
mistake, Governor Pardee said. Irriga
tion is, and should be, wholly independ
ent of rainfall. In a brief resume of what
has already been accomplished, Governor
Pardee declared that with liberal and in
telligent reclamation the Sacramento Val
ley can be made a mighty empire.
He then introduced J. B. Lippincott. su

TO COLONIZE
FRESNO TRACT
Pa^ $1,000,000 For
25;000 Acres
of Land.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. Oct. 2jUâ About ten days ago
W. Q. Kerckhoff of Los Angeleg, presi
dent of, the San Joaquin Power Company,
closed a deal with the Bank of California
acquiring a tract of 25,000 acres west of
town, known as "the Bank of California
Tract." The price la. not known, but as
the bank had been holding .the land for
$40 an acre the price must nave been in
the neighborhood, of ?1,000,000.
. It is the intention to colonize the tract
immediately. A contract has already
been made with a well-known coloniza
tion agency In Chicago whereby the
agency agrees to bring out 50 families
withing CO days, 100 families within six
months and 150 families before the end
of the Tear 1906. It is intended to sell
the land in subdivisions of. from 40 to 160
acres. The bank has owned the property
for twenty-five years and though it sold
some no attempt at colonization was
made. v - . ;.;
Most of the land is well adapted to the
raising of alfalfa and sugar beets. It has
exceptionally good water rights, : being
entitled to one-fourth of the first thous
and feet flowing in the Fresno canal. The
main Church ditch runs through it. The
deal was financed by . Kerckhoff in the
interests of moneyed men who will unite
with him to form a corporation to carry
out the colonization scheme.
It is expected that the Fresno City
Railway Company will extend a line Into
the tract within a year or two.

LONDON, Oct. 21.â Friends of Mrs. Ar
thur Paget will be sorry to learn that,
though she is pronounced out of dan
ger from the results of recent aerious
operations, there is more than a fear
that she will yet 'be bedridden for life..
. It was never made known how serious
her condition was when she underwent
the last operation, after which she went
into a succession of fainting j fits from
which she was restored with great diffi
culty.
Sir Alfred Fripp now finds the, bone of
her leg not yet showing the slightest
signs of growth and until it does, it is
absolutely impossible to say whether it
can be cured. She must remain almost
in one position until January, at least,
before it will be known whether she will
be bedridden the remainder of her
life or not.
Throughout all Mrs. Paget remains
wonderfully cheerful.

President Roosevelt Tells
of the Policy of Nation
Toward Small Neighbors
HE SPEAKS IN FLORIDA
Given Enthusiastic Welcome
by the People of Jackson
ville in the Far South
JACKSONVILLE. Fla.. Oct. 21.â The
reception of President Roosevelt In Jack
sonville to-day was a hearty one. Thou
sands thronged the streets on his line of
march and the President showed in his
manner his appreciation of the good will
that was manifested on every side. So
far as comfort was concerned the day
was ideal. A cool wind had begun to blow
the night before, and it gave a tempera
ture that no one could call too warm or
too cold. l v;A â¢\u25a0â¢?;: .-?./\u25a0.
After driving through the principal
streets the President was taken to tlie
Seminole Club, where he made a brief
address on good citizenship. He was then
driven to the Jacksonville Board of Trade
Auditorium, where luncheon was served.
SPEECH OP rKESIDEXT.
After luncheon the President spoke as
follows:
Hera In Florida, the first of the GuK States
which I have visited upon this trip, I wish
to say a special word about the Panama canal.
1 believe that the canal will be of ereat
benent to all our people, but most of all to
the States of the South Atlantic the Gulf
and the Pacific slope. When comDleted, the
canal will stand as a monument to this na
tion; for It will be the greatest engineering
feat ever accomplished in the world. It will
be a' good thing tor the world as a whole/ and
for the people of the isthmus and of the north
ern portions of South America in particular.
Bec*U6Â« of our especial Interest in it, and be
cause of the position we occupy on this hem
isphere. It is a matter of special pride to us
that our nation, the American nation, should
have undertaken the performance of this
world duty. .-.^ : -- -.-;.\u25a0.
A body of the most eminent engineers In
the world, both Americans and foreigners,
baa been summoned to advise as to the type
of canal which should be built. At no distant
date I hope to be able to announce what their
advice is. and also the action taken upon their
advice. Meanwhile the work is already well
under way and has advanced sufficiently far
to enable me to announce with certainty that
It can surely be accomplished and probably at
rather less expense than was anticipated.
But upon the last point, as well as upon the
question of time, no positive statement can be
made until the report of the committee of en
gineers as to the exact type of canal has been
received. The work is as difficult aa it is
important; and it is of cour*a Inevitable that
from time to time difficulties will occur and
checks be encountered. Whenever such is the
case the men of little faith at home will lose
that little faith and the critics who confound
hyeteria with emphasis will act after their
kind. But our people as a whole possess not
only faith, but resolution, and are of too
virile fiber to be swt;t one way or the other
bs - mere sensationalism. No check that may
come will be of more than trivial and passing
consequence, will inflict any permanent dam
are, or cause any serious delay. . The work'
can be done, is Wins done, and will be done.
What has already been accomplished is a guar
anty as to the future. â¢ -,-
OUTCRY OF WEAKLIXGS.
When any such work is undertaken there
are always many mere adventurers who flock
to where it is solve on, and many men who
think they are adventurers but who are in re
ality either too weak or too timid, follow in
their footsteps. Some of the first class will
now and then cause trouble in one way or an
other. But Â«?vry care will be taken to d
tect any misdeed on their part and to punish
them an soon an-the misdeed is. detected. : .As
"Tor 'the second class.-'they -will -cause trouble
chiefly by losing heart, returning- home, or
writing home, and raising: a cry, that they are
not happy anl that the conditions" of life are
not easy or that the work is not being done
as they think it ought to be done.
Now these men stand Just as the stragglers
and laggards stand who are ever to be" fodnd
in the rear of even a victorious army. The
veteran* of the Civil War who are here Drea
mt will tell you that the very ' rear of the
army, even when It is victorious, is apt to
look and behave aa if the victory were de
feat. And Just the same thing Is true In any
great enterprise In civil life; there are always
weaklings who get trampled down or' lose heart,
and there are always people who listen to
their complaints. They amount to nothing
on* way or the other so far as achieving re
mits is concerned; and their complaints and
outcries need never detain us.
I call your attention specifically to the mat
ter of health on the Isthmus. The climate was
supposed to be deadly, and yellow fever, es
pecially. waÂ» supposed to be epidemic. Yet
since we have assumed control there has been
fBr less yellow ferer than in our own coun
try; the administration is steadily becoming
better and more effective, from the hysrlenie
as well as from, every other standpoint The
work of building the canal is a great Ameri
can work, in which the whole American peo
ple are Interested. It has nothing to do with
parties or partlsansht- and is being carried
on with absolute disregard of all merely po
litical considerations: with regard only to
efficiency, honesty and economy.
CONTROL. OP THE CARIBBEAN.
The digging of the canal will, of course,
greatly increase our Interest In the Caribbean
Â£ea. It will be our duty to police the canal,
both in the Interest of other nations and in
our own interest. To do this it Is, of course,
indispensable to have an efficient navy (and
I am happy to say that we are well on our
way toward having one) and also to possess,
as we already possess, certain strategic
points to control the approach to the canal.
In addition it is 'urgently necessary that the
insular and continental countries within or
bordering upon the Caribbean Sea should be
able to secure fair dealing and orderly liberty
within their own borders.
I need not say that the United States not
only has no purpose of aggression upon any
republic, continental or Insular, to the couth
of us, but has the friendliest feeling toward
them, and desires nothing save their progress
and prosperity. We do not wish another foot
of territory, and I think our conduct toward
Cuba is a guaranty, that thia is our genuine

'attitude toward all our sister republics. If
ever we should have to Interfere in the affairs
of any of our neighbors It would only be when
we found it impossible longer to refrain from
doing po without serious damage I following!
and even In such case it would only be with
the sincere and effective purpose to .make our
interference beneficial to the peoples concerned.
Of course, occupying the position we do, oc
casionn may now and then arl*e when wÂ« can
not refrain from such interference, save under
penalty of seeing some other strong nation
undertake the duty which we neglect; and
such neglect would be unfortunate from more
than one . standpoint. . Wiierever possible we
should gladly give any aid we can to a weak
er sister republic which Is endeavoring to
achieve stability and prosperity. It is an un
generous thing for us to refuse such aid, and
it Is foolish not to pive It in a way that, will
make it really effective and, : therefore of-di
rect benefit to the people 'concerned â and of
Indirect benefit to us, simply because It Is a
benefit to them.
.In the last, resort, .and, only. In .the last re
sort, it may â¢ occasionally^be necessary to in
terfere'by exercising what Is virtually an in
ternational police power, if only to avoid see*
Ing some â¢ European power forced to -exercise
it. In short, while we must interfere always
cautiously, and never .'van tonly; yet, on rare
occasions, where the need is great, . it may
be â¢' necessary to interfere unless* we are will
ing, to confess ourselves too feeble for â¢ the
task we' have undertaken, and to avow., that
we are willing to surrender It Into stronger
hands, and for such confession and avowal

ADVISE TO THE NEGROES.
After luncheon the President was
driven to the Negro Baptist Academy,
where he. delivered a shor^, address, j Pre
ceding his. speech there was. a brief cere
mony In' the assembly hall, in' which the
students participated. This consisted in
the singing of a number* of songs espe
cially written for the occasion. The last
one, entitled "You Are All Right, Teddy."
caused the President to smile broadly.
The President was then conducted to a
stand in front of the academy, where he
made his speech. He said in* part: \
My friends, let me say what " a pleasure It
has been in driving along the street* to ; hayÂ«
the Governor and the Mayor point out to me
house after house owned by., colored oltlzens.
who by their own-industry, energy and thrift
had accumulated a tmaH fortune honestly and
were f spending it wisely. ... ,~+: ..
Every good ..American must be interested
in -seeing every "other- good American citizen
rise" help" himself .upward so as ' to : be better
able '\u25a0 to do his duty by himself and" those
dependent upon him and by the' State at large,
"it l seems to ' me that It is r true of; all \ of ; vs '
that our duties are even more important than
our*rlghts.' ' If we "do our duty, faithfully, in

Is absolutely essential that we should hayÂ«

only a limited amount of room In the pro

amount of room for. men in agriculture and

to develop kooil teachers, to develop gooa

the man who is decentA and - clean In hi&

doing, the .man who treats his neighbor well:
who is a good man -"In his 'own family and
therefore a good man in the State. That is
what we have a right to, expect from the

VAL.L.EJO, Oct. 21.â 1t was a sensa
tional and quick linish that the defense
in the court-iiiurtial of Commander lou
den Young of the Berin;n^ton, made at
the"ilare l3land-OTavy "iard to-day, and
even the prosecution admits its surprise.
Navy officers at Mare Island and Vallejo
people who have followed Ihu course of
the inquiry, are talking of little else to
day.
. Young went on the stand at the open
ing of this morning's session and after
verifying, his testimony ol yesterday,
through his counsel, Judge Gear, sub
mitted two important documents which
were admitted as evidence. They show
that only a few, days after Young took
command of the Bennington in 1901 he
sent a report to the department statiny
that in an examination of the enginuor
ing room of the . Bennington made at
Panama, the boilers were found to be in
a bad condition. This examination was
made .by Young in company with Lieu
tenant Commander Herbert. Herbert
pointed out the defective condition \u25a0 of
the boilers' and Young immediately for
warded a report to the department.
The report made by Rear Ad
miral Goodrich and found in the
log book . of the Bennington, . af
ter an examination of the condi
tion of the Bennington made at Mag
dalena Bay on October 6, 1904, was sub
mitted. In Goodrich's own. handwriting
it was found that the Admiral said:' \u25a0;
'â¢My opinion of the condition of the
ship**, boilers 1m betft shown by the fact
thnt> I buve ordered her to Sun Frau
f!f><M>, there to remain as v stutlon
EFFORTS ARE FUTILE.
Judge Advocate West attempted to
break down Young's testimony, but. his
efforts were futile, and when the-ac
cused olhccr left the witness stand ithere
was^an'^aic Â£t}f fsuppjes^ed;? excitement
about tliti feottttrDpm^givh'ich'ntas shared
by board and Tsp'ectators alike.
Judge Gear and Xaval Constructor
Holden A. Evans, who have labored so
strenuously for the cause of their cli
ent,- exchanged self-satisfied --emiles,
and Judge Advocate West moved un
easily. But the sensation of the trial
"was yet to come.
Judge Gear introduced the following
order from Rear Admiral Goodrich to
Commander Young:
"FliiÃshlp , Chicago, Santa . Barbara,

and Commander-in-chief of 'the \u25a0 Pacific

TRAVELS 30,000 MILES. â¢
That Goodrich should have requested
the Navy Department to allow the Ben
nington only ten days at Mare Island for
repairs before ordering the : ship on a
cruise that would extend from San Fran
cisco to Honolulu, thence to San Diego
and onHo Panama and return, in the face
of his signed statement dated seven
months previously stating that her condi
tion was such that she- was fltjfor duty
as only a station ship, seemingly makes
Goodrich the responsible person instead
of Young. At that time Goodrich was
also aware that after, his report of her
poor condition the Bennington had trav
eled 30,000 miles without any but minor
repairs. ...
A member of the' Bennington's crew,
who was present in the ante-room and
who heard the statement of Young about
the hurry-up repairs made at Mare i Is
land and later the jobs hurried through
with while the Berinington was lying in
San Francisco Bay previous to " her de
parture for Honolulu, told the Call repre
sentative that when the ship reached
Honolulu orders were given to a contract
ing firm in that city to make some re
pairs before the Bennington could pro
ceed to SanJ)iego and that great secrecy
was maintained aboard ship over the na
ture of those repairs. When questioned
after the. adjournment of the. court in
reference 'to these repairs. Commander
Young refused to discuss the* matter,*' but
he did not deny that such repairs -were
made. :- :

weeks' negotiations, the Palmer Liquid
Coffee Company of San Francisco, has

MAN HANGS HIMSELF
FIFTY FEET IN AIE
Tree Chopped Down to Get

Suicide.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SOUTH NOR WALK, Conn.. Oct. 21.â
Swinging In a gale fifty feet above the
ground, the nearly unclothed body of
a man -was found hanging by a strap
about his neck from a branch of a tall
hickory tree on "Westport avenue to
day. Near the foot of the tree was a
heavy .fleece-lined undershirt. From
the green stains on the sleeves it is
thought the man cast It from him after
he had climbed the tree. A pair of
heavy water-soaked shoes also lay at
the foot of the tree. That the man
wore no hat nor coat led some to be
lieve that he "lived not far from the
spot. , â¢
No one would gro up the tree to
fasten ropes to the body so It could be
lowered, though two young men tried
it and lost heart. The tree therefore
was chopped down. The body has not
been -identified. In the trousers were a
knife and some small change.

SILL BOY HAS
"COFFEE HEART"
< v
yChiid of Eight Is in City Hos-
pital Slowly Regaining
Health.
HEART BEATS TOO FAST
Muscle Was Wearing- Itself Out
â Drank a Dozen Cups
a Day.
Excessive coffee drinking-. City Hospi-
tal physicians say, is the cause of little
Jotinny Murphy's heart disease. Jtf-
thougrh only 8 years old. he has one of
the worst cases of heart lesion that has
ever come to the institution.
When he entered the hospital the
child's heart was beating 160. to the
minute. Just twice, the normal rate for
a. child of his^agre. For one month he
has Itad no coffee and his heart action
has been reduced to 100 beats a minute.
For two years the child has been
drinking: from nine to twelve cups of
strong- coffee every day. He beg-an to
â¢ complain of pains as if needles were
slicking in his heart, and for a year
has slept scarcely thre* hours a night,
and then oulj- when sitting- propped up
in a chair beside an open window.
Johnnie did not care for thing's to
eat; coffee wa* all the food he craved,
and except when cake or candy was
given him. he took no other nour-
ishment. As he was sick and not ex-
pected to recover, he was given all the
coffee he desired "until a physician saw
him and advised that he be sent to City
Hospital.
HEART WAS OVERWORKED.
Every beat of the child's heart could
be plainly seen. To one inexperienced
In medicine, v would seem that the
heart extended over two-thirds of the
chest region, and the pulsation is of a
heavy, prolonged character, quite dif-
ferent from the sharp, quick beat of
U)e normal heart.
The boy iÂ« small for his age, and ef-
forts of physicians have been to build
up his strength. Hi* treatment has been
largely tonics and heart regulating
medicines. Buch as strophantus or dig-
italis.
As the heart, like other muscles, can
stand only a jriw-n amount of work,
hospital Internes estimate that .the 60
beats a minute he Is now being saved
by his abstinence from coffee will pro-
long his life 10 or 12 years.
The heart of a man who dies at 70
years has beaten 260 million times, and
if the normal beat is 72, little Johnny
Mnrphy was living twice as fast as any
normal peraon. . When he flrst entered
the hospital physicians freely prophe-
ekd that he couid live only a few weeks.
' Under the treatment and total absti-
nence from coffee he has Â«o improved
that his chances for a long life are con-
sidered good if the heart lesion and de-
generation already net up can be
healed. .'â¢'\u25a0--\u25a0
He is a son of John Murphy of 116
South Fourteenth street. Mrs. Murphy
told the physicians that none of her
other children had showed signs of
heart disease nor had they a" marked
foncneÂ«s for coffee. â St. Louis Post-
Dispatch.
Literally thousands of people suffer
more or less from heart weakness
caused by coffee, and with some even
one cup a day will bring on heart
trouble.
The heart that has been only slightly
attacked by coffee will protest and
make Us weak condition known under
elight exertion, and it Is plainly a
dangerous condition to get into. It 'is
a curious fact that co<ffee does not al-
ways attack the heart, but goes after
the stomach, liver and_ bowels of some
and leaves the heart alone. - '.
It is plainly classed as an active.toxic
and its work shows somewhere on
most users. It is easy to rid one's self
of the habit by using well-brewed Pos-
tum Coffee. The change in symptoms
i* ehown In & day or two as* a rule,-
and that change shows the user to a
certainty that coffee was the destroyer.
It Is useless to warn 1 some people,
even when it is easy to anit and be
well again. So they peg along, sick
and miserable, charging their ails to
"food." "east wind." "heredity" and
whatnot, until some day the stroke
-cmes when abused nature reaches the
hmit. It's easy to be well if one
cares for the Joy of health. One of thÂ«
plain, cure. well-built and well-kept
highways, -with Elgn boards on each'
tide, is the Posturn rout*.
There's a reason.
OPAL TRADERS
LAND IN JAIL
Flood of the Stones Pcruriiig
Into Texas Across; Border
Arouses the Authorities
TWO APtKESTS EFFECTED
Believed That a King* Is at
Work Smuggling the Gems
Into the United States
Sjeciai Dispatch to Tha' Call.
AUSTIN, Oct. 21.â The Federal au
thorities of this district received notice
some time ago that a flood of opals was
pourlnf into this country from Mexico.
It was believed that .the stones were
srnug-g-led across the border and plans
were arranged to capture the persons
employed In the smuggling operations.
Two Mexicans. Felipe Kicco and Renito
Mirando. who are alleged to belong to
a gang of opal smugglers, have been
arresttd by. United states officers at
San Antonio. Other important arrests
are expected to follow soon;
At the time of the arrest ,the men
were going from store to atore ex
hibiting a few of the stones and en
deavoring to persuade proprietors of
Jewelery establishments to purchase
them. j
After the men were searched it was
discovered that the opals they were ex
hibiting were only a few of those in
their possession. A large cigar box on
being opened revealed more Than a
thousand dollars' worth of Stones*. Cus
toms Collector C. ML Ferguson was at
once notified and one of the deputies
took the men in charge and had them
locked up in the County Jail to await
action.' . .
Ricco is evidently the leader, for he
did moÃt of the talking, while Mirando
assumed the part of a. servant, follow
ing about and fulfilling commands. The
men were in the habit of traveling sepa
rately, or at least they never walked
side by side, Mirando always bringing
up the" rear. It was Mirando who kept
the cigar box, while Ricco would enter
the jewelery stores, engage the pro
prietors in conversation and endeavor
to do business with them.
One or two of the merchants asked
if the opals were duty paid, at which
Ricco would extract from his pocket
book customs receipts to show that he
had passed through the custom-house
and had paid duty for so many opals.
The receipts, however, two in number,
amounted to only $7 50, covering about
$76. worth of stones, while some of the
opals alone were worth at least $100.
In one package he had some of the
finest specimens of the gems ever seen
in Texas, the authorities say. There
were six or eight of these stones that
would be hard to duplicate- anywhere.
Ricco was asking $100 for each of them.
Other packages contained stones of less
value, ranging all the way from 25
cents to' s7s. â¢
Ricco showed he -had passed through
the custom-house at Brownsville on
September 30 and paid $6 on opals in
his possession. October 2 he passed
through the same port of' entry and
paid duty to the amount oX $1 50 on the
same variety- of stone?; : :
There is another man at?' .present in
Austin who is said to. have a box ot
opals in his possession and has been
endeavoring to get rid of^ them here in
a manner to excite suspicion.
On being searched papers were found
on Ricco.' showing the number of jewels
in his possession and names 1 of curio
dealers and jewelers in most of the
principal cities of the United States.
The contents Â»f this book may reveal
many interesting features before the
case is concluded. Ricco has evident
ly been trading in opals on a most ex
tensive scale. When questioned by the
authorities, he said he owned an opal
bed within 200 miles of the City of Mex
ico, on the National Mexican Railroad.

ation for President a year-2Â»r more ago
was quoted by a lawyer to-day in de
fense of Moses Haas and Frederick H.
Peckham. who recently were indicted by
the Federal Grand Jury in Washington
on a charge of conspiring with Edwin S.
Holmes Jr.. to defraud the Government
by securing in advance information of
the. Government's cotton report. The
portion of the President's letter quoted
was that "there is no common law of
the United States that can give" jurisdic
tion of ah ofTense In a Federal court."
The indictment had alleged that. Holmes
was guilty of misconduct in entering into
the conspiracy. The defense . declared
that no euch offense as misconduct could'
be found in any law of Congress, which
alone could give Jurisdiction of an of
fense to a Federal court, but the prose-;
cution contended that it was an offense
against the common law of the District
of Columbia. It was to controvert this
assertion that the President's statement
was quoted by the lawyer in defense.
Decision on the motion to discharge
Haas and Peckham from custody was re
served. &. Â» ; y

THE KEIXV FORGERY CASE
District Attorney Admits He Hum \ot

The case of Thomas A, Kelly,
charged with forgery, was called in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday morn
ing to be set for trial. The District At
torney made a motion that the case be
dismissed on the ground that there was
r.ot sufficient available testimony with
whioh to go to trial, as the principal
witness was in State's prison and other
important â¢witnesses were either dead
or had left the State. The motion was
granted and another similar case

THE- SAN FRANCISCO.-GALi;.- SUNDAY. OCTOBER; 22, 1905.;
RUSSIA FACES
A BIG STRIKE
Men on All the Eailroads
of Czar's Empire Called
On to Leave Their Work
ENTIRELY POLITICAL
Believed That Union Desires
to Test Its Strength for
Concerted Move in January
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 21.â The strike
of railroad employes assumed, a serious
aspect to-day when, with the three great
trunk lines out of Moscow completely tied
up and the other Moscow, roads embar-_
rassed, trains were stopped on the branch
road from Nizhni Novgorod. The Pari-_
Russian Union of Railway Employes has
issued a call for a 'general strike on all
the railroads of Russia. The. extent, to
which the call will be obeyed remains to
be seen, as the union is of recent' origin
and.its strength is an unknown quantity, -.
but up to midnight no additional "strikes
have been reported. A* meeting of St.'
Petersburg railway men was still in ses
sion at a late hour to-night and had not
reached a decision to strike. J^.'
The demands of the men are purely po
litical and therefore it 'Is expected "the
strike will last only, long enough to .'serve
the purpose of a demonstration. The So
cialist leaders claim, it is .called' only' to
test their strength and is a curtain raiser
to a thorough and complete' tie-up of the
Russian x-ailroad Eystems ln January as
an object, lesson to the Government and
douma," and that it. will be called off aa
soon as it is seen that the strike machin
ery is . properly.
The political nature of the movement Is
shown In the. call of the National' Union
for a general \u25a0 strike, which makes no
mention of economic demands and. de
clares the. workmen .are fighting for the
elementary human rights of freedom of
speech and of the press and a repre
sentative government on the basis of uni
versal suffrage, and that these are ob
tainable only by a strike.
'iÃrothers," the call says, "we have
great power In our hands. The railroad
employes throughout Russia share our
views. The time has â¢ come to declare a
general strike. Before our might the
Government must give way."
The Government is prepared, in case' the
rtrlke affects the Nicolal Railroad or the
lines to Berlin and Vienna, to order the
mobilization of the railroad battalions of
the army In order to keep communication
open between Moscow and ' St. Peters
burg and abroad, but It hopes the strike
enthusiasm of the workmen will exhaust
itself in a few days.
AERO FLIGHTS
NOW THE FAD
Sky-Touring in 4 Balloons
Is Engaging' the Attention
of the Parisian Populace
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS. Oct. 2Lâ With the Aero Club"s
great contest on Sunday, and the Le
baudy balloon ascent at Toulon on Thurs
day, ballooning has loomed large in the
public eye this week. Aeronauts are jub
ilant over the race for the Grand Prix.
It was not only an unqualified success,
with respect to competitors, freedom
from accidents, length of the Journeys
accomplished and widespread Interest
taken in the competition by the public
but It further justifies the most optimistic
predictions for the future of this fascinat
ing sport. *
As Comte Henry de la Vaulx pointed out
in The Call-Herald interview, the long list
of competitors, all aeronauts from pure
love of the.sport,' proves that ballooning
has been finally taken out of the hand?
of self-dubbed professors at country fairs
and is entering seriously into every-day
life.
For this satisfactory result credit is
due to such enthusiastic sportsmeh as the
Comte de la Vaulx himself, the Marquis
de Dion, M. Santos-Dumont. the Comte
de Castillon de Saint Victor, M. Jacques
Faure,' winner of last Sunday's contest,
and other active members of the Aero
Club, veritableonisslonaries of ballooning.
Thanks to their enlightened efforts, aero
navigation has developed more In ton
years than in the preceding century, so
that Comte dc la Vaulx is able now to
declare that ballooning is not so,danger
ous as automobiling.
The Lebaudy airship on Thursday" as
cended at half-past 8 in,, the morning,

V ROME, Oct. 21.â -Archbishop Patriak
W. Riordajrof San Francisco was re
ceived in private audience by the PopÂ«
to-day. ..The Pope was most cordial,
and showed perfect knowledge of
American affairs. He manifested great
interest ln the diocese of San Fran
cisco, inquired about the progress of
the Italian Society there and -Italian
immigrants, and expressed pleasure at
the satisfactory reports received.
The Pope recalled, that Archbishop
Kiordan had been in Rome in 1902,
after the happy solution of the pious
fund Question, while Pope Pius X was
still Patriarch of Venice. \ j
Archbishop iliordan found the Pope
In, excellent . health, and vigor, both
mentally und physically.*
Among the various ' questions dis
cussed at the Vatican by Archbishop
Riordan was the condition of the Cath
olic University at Washington, concern
ing which Bithop Parkins of Provi
dence spoke to the authorities during
his recent visit here. Mgr. Riordan
gave his ideas as ; to, . the meas
ures that should be adopted in order
to bring the university to such a stand
ard in both science and Catholicism
as to make it profitable. He expressed
it as his view, however, that' all meas
ures should be. postponed until the com
mission- compoped of , Archbishop Far
ley of New York. Bishop Macs of Coy-
I iugton, Ky., and Bishop Har'cins makes
its report at' the next meeting of the
board of directors of the university,

COMMISSION CLOSES
THE DOORS OF BANK
Fails to Meet Requirements of
the State Law.
Liabilities Are Reported to
Amount to $339,782.
The Bank Commissioner* yesterday closed the doors of the United Bank
and Tract Company of this city and Its branches In Snn Francisco and Ala
medJU The statement fsuned by the company October 17 disclosed liabili
ties smonntlus to $330,782 23. The Bsnk Commissioners report that they
discovered that promissory notes were accepted in payment for capital
stock, and that for this and other reasons they decided to suspend the buol-
BtM of the company until a full Investigation could be made by an expert
for the State. Commissioner Dunsmoor and. the directors of the banking;
company say that they expect that the depositors Trill be paid In full. If the
report is not satisfactory to the Commissioners a receiver will be asked for.
tPh* Bank Commissioners ordered the
United Bank and Trust Company, which
tÂ»M b**n doing a banking business in
:th* Mills building-, with branches at 1010
jl&arket street. Sixteenth and Market and
Noe streets, and at the corner of Park
*toreet and Santa Clara avenue, Alameda,
lo suspend business and close Its doors.
tats order Included all the branches.
This action was In pursuance of reso
.Krdons adopted unanimously by the
iÃank Commissioners, Messrs. Blackstook.
DuiLExn&or and Silver, in which It was set
forth that the United Bank and Trust
Company had been guilty of conducting
Its business in an unsafe manner and that
an order from the commissioners to dis
continue unsafe practices had not .been
oozspiled with within thÂ« time prescribed
for such compliance. In the opinion or
the commissioners It was unsafe for the
corporation to continue to transact busi
ness.
_, Commissioner Blacks tock was directed
to take control Immediately of the cor
poration and all of its affairs and to em
ploy all necessary agents ; and to incur
needed exDense. Commissioner Black
etock's Instructions also were to retain
control of the corporation until otherwise ,
ordered by a court of competent juris
diction.
ACCUSED BY WEBB.
The board took the drastic step under
the instruction of Attorney General WeDb
and after Governor Pardee had been noti
fied of the facts as they appeared to the
commissioners. Allen Knight was placed
in the bank by the commission to make
an Investigation.
According to Commissioners* Dunsmoor |
and Silver, the manner in which stock
was paid for was the principal cause of
the action of the Bank Commissioners. -
Mr. DUUSWwr said tiwrt -it -had .been Â«s-.
certained that promissory notes were
taken in payment for subscriptions to the
capital stock. The Bank -Commissioners
objected to this as illegal. Then, said
Commissioner Silver, the first promissory
notes were surrendered and other promis
sory notes were taken from the same
parties in payment for capital stock.
"We regarded that," said Commissioner
Silver, "as merely a subterfuge. Learn
ing of it, we took steps to close the bank
pending iin investigation."
It was also said by the Bank Commis
sioners that the board found that there
was not enough available capital to per
mit, legally, of the maintenance of
branches by the United Bank and Trust
Company. As to the ability of the con-
M,cern to resume. Commissioner Dunsmoor,
chairman of the Bank Commission, said
that he believed It would be possible for
liabilities to be met without loss to the
depositors. He also said that a confer
ence had been arranged to take place to
morrow morning at 9 o'clock In the rooms
of the Bank Commissioners, at which all
the facts to be presented by the directors
and officers of the banking company and
trust company would be carefully con
sidered.
OTHER REASOXS WITHHELD.
Mr. Dunsmoor also said that there were
reasons for closing the bank that the
commissioners did not wish to disclose
Immediately, and "would not until the rep
resentative of the commissioners who Is
making an Investigation into the bank s
affairs could get a report ready. What
these reasons were all the commissioners
declined to make public-
The statement drawn from the books of
the United Bank and Trust Company and
its agencies showed total liabilities of
$339,782 23. The liabilities Included the fol
lowing Items: Capital paid up, , 5212.575:
due depositors, $107,749 90; due banks and
bankers. 55271 66; Interest collected, $10,
781 41; rents, exchange, etc.. $3035 31; oth
er liabilities. $2.
The Items of the statement of re
sources were as follows: Invested In
\u25a0tocks, bonds and warrants, $30,450; loans
and discounts, J15G.423 21; cash balances,
140.353 37; due from banks and bankers.
$27,717 03; furniture, fixtures, etc., $2986 13;
t expenses, taxes, etc.. J31.652 49.
The appearance yesterday of a notice
on the doors of the company attracted
attention Immediately. Depositors of the
bank who transact business In the vicin
ity of the main offices of the' concern In
quired of the officers and directors about
the facts and the latter had. a decidedly
busy afternoon. Notices were sent out to
the stockholders, who number several
hundred, to attend a meeting last even-
Ing. Depositors who had accounts In the
bank were requested to let them, remain.
The Immediate task for the directors was
to provide tor the payment of depositors.
By the statement the amount due depos
itors Is $107,749 90.
DEPOSITORS WILL. BE PAID.
Hermann Bendel, first vice president of
the company, said that there would be
no difficulty In raising the money to meet
all depositors promptly. He said that
stockholders yestefday afternoon provided
for raising $20,000 at once. The cash bal
ances shown in the statement amounted
to $40,553 37. The amount due from banks j
and bankers, $27,717 03, added to the cash
balances and the amounts pledged yester
day afternoon left only about $10,000 to
be provided for.
Against this. could be set the $50,450 in
vested in stocks, bonds and warrants. In
his view of the, matter there would be no
difficulty in meeting all the claims of the
depositors without delay. I Frank X.
Myers, president, and Hugo D. Newhouse, j
who Is connected with the company, were
equally certain that the claims could all
be met.
What action the Bank Commissioners
will take to-morrow is uncertain. They J
would not make any announcement of J
.their course, except to say that it might]
be necessary to ask for the appointment
of a receiver, but they would not be com
mitted on that point until they had full
Information that they did not then pos
sess.

banks," because It secured a charter durr
ing the time when the State law lapsed
and more than seventy banks similarly
originated. At that time there were no
provisions regarding the amount of capi-"
tal that must be subscribed. The United
Bank and Trust Company was formerly
known as the Citizens 1 Bank. The entire
amount of capital subscribed when the
bank opened, said Commissioner Duns
moor, was but $2500.
OFFICERS OP THE BANK.
The report on file with the Bank Com
missioners shows that the capital stock
at the start was $50,000. It was subse
quently Increased to $2,000,000. The offi

M. Goewey Jr., formerly of the United
States transport service; secretary, J. C.

Colonel Bendel was formerly of the firm
of Tillman & Bendel. Goewey is man

the banking business some time ago.
Connected with . the company are four
advisory boards, which jointly include
about 120 members. Arthur P. Holland,
president of the Stocker-Holland Com

H. Methmann, grocer, and Joseph F. For

In a folder published by the company
the following announcements are made:
"We pay 4 per cent per annum, payable
semi-annually, on all savings from date
of deposit. We pay 2 per cent per annum
on check accounts in excess of $300. We
loan money on collateral security, both

who opens a savings account with us.
The .only condition we attach to the gift
is that the child shall deposit not less
than one dollar a month for one year. At
any time during the year the money de
posited can be withdrawn."
The officers of the United Bank and
Trust Company are expected to submit a
statement to the Bank Commissioners to
morrow. If this is not satisfactory the
company may be taken Into court. One
of the stockholders said last evening that
when depositors came In yesterday they
were requested to pay In cash for their
subscribed stock, taking the money from
their deposits. Nearly all those whose
names appear in connection with the four
advisory boards of the company j are en
gaged In retail business.
The United Bank and Trust Company
was Incorporated" March 4, 1503, a little
more than two and a half years ago. The
Bank Commissioners say that they have
had various matters relating to the bank
under discussion with the officers during
something like eighteen months and that
some matters have been adjusted.
MEETING IS HELD.
The stockholders and depositors held a
meeting in the bank last evening and
several resolutions were passed. There
were sixty-five depositors present, repre
senting $61,000 deposited, and out of this
number sixty-three people signed a resol
ution to leave the amount of their de
posits with the bank until the assets and
outstanding loans are collected. The
largest part of the amount was signed
for by some three or four companies
which held- the majority of the stock,
among which were the Central Real Es
tate Company, signed for $6592 and the
Central Title Company for $7257, and a
few others ranging from $6000 \o $10,000.
Meyers, president of the bank, ad
dressed the depositors and scored the
Commission for Its hasty actions and
stated that the Commission had been
prejudiced against the bank by other
business firms whose business had been
affected by the rapid growth of the bank.
He stated that the bank owed the deposi
tors $107,000. of which amount it had $65,
000 in cash and 5157.000 in notes which
could be converted Into cash if necessary.
Fifty per cent or the deposits have been
pledged to the bank and, according to
Mr. Meyers, the other 50 will be pledged
before Monday morning. \u0084, â¢
A committee of. five was appointed,
from the depositors, to; wailt upon the

COCKRAN TALKS
OF PHILIPPINES
New York Congressman Tells
of Difficulties Besetting
Country's Good Purpose
PEOPLE -APPEECIATIVE
Many Attend Lecture Given
by Statesman in Aid of
the Youths' Directory
Oratory is not dead and the classicist
can hold men to-day as dominantly as
when the art was youngâ so thought the
thousand and more men and women who
listened last night ' to W. Bourke Cock
ran in a two-hour lecture on "The Policy
of tho United States in the Philippines."
It had been announced that, the distin
guished publicist would speak on a sub
ject of intimate interest to San Fran
ciscans and that the proceeds of the lec
ture would be presented to California's
citizen-maker. Father P. Crowely, for a
furtherance of his plans, hence was there
small wonder that the big auditorium
was filled from footlights to gallery, and
filled with people who think and people
who feel.
Sixty or seventy "leading citizens" had
been asked to ornament the stage, all of
whom rose elegantly when. the guest of
honor arrived/ escorted by his Honor the
Mayor and by John R. Kelly, president
of the board of directors of the Directory.
Mr. Kellv attended to the formalities
of introduction, stating Incidentally that
the Directory would be vastly assisted
through Mr. Cockran's generosity. And
by way of recompense told him that in
the nineteen years of the existence of the
philanthropy that 9210 boys had been
rescued from the streets and welded into
useful citizensâ a record worth pondering
over.
Applause that carried with it a per
sonal note greeted the New Yorker, and,
lest he be a tremendously good actor, it
was as warmly appreciated, coming
"from people three thousand miles away
from home."
A man of great personal magnetism, of
Intense personality, and of mellifluous
voice he revealed himself to be In his
first sentences. As he grew in his dis
cussion, the lucidity of his views, the
breadth of his knowledge of conditions
and the sweep of his vision were revealed
as he unfolded, step by step, the policy
of the Government in the Philippines.
"Our taking of the islands," said he,
"was the most extraordinary and unex
pected instance of national benevolence.
Nations in .the past have assumed sover
eignly over, alien peoples, -not for benevo
lent purposes/: but for plunder and the
extensions -of wealth - and power. That
President Roosevelt .and Secretary Taft
have followed the policy of benevolent
purposes solely is an indisputable fact;
but that many leaders of their party have
followed the course for plunder is equally
trueâ for instance, the hasty extension in
Congress of the "coastwise commerce
law," whereby the Philippines are forced.
to trade in ships flying the stars and I
stripes, and at their own price. And this,
too. in spite of the fact that a tariff is
levied upon the exports of . the islands
just as upon any other foreign nation."
From this premise Mr. Cockran argued
that the islands cannot produce) or will
not produce through resultant commercial
discouragement, the wealth that Is needec
to carry^ on her Internal government.
"Education of the Filipino," said the
speaker, "is the aim of American policy,
for with education alone, can the Fili
pino become capable of self-pvernment."
This, the United State 3 declares, is the
ultimate destiny of the islands. And here
is the rub, as Mr. Cockran sees it, for
the people are indifferent to the advan
taes of education, and the country is too
poor to pay for education, the entire
revenue of the government not exceeding
$15,000,(X)0 per annum. â¢ .. .-
As an antidote, the speaker would have
teachers go into the islands who would
give their services free, in the name of
the brotherhood of manâ men and women
who do, not. work for pay, but for love.
And whether they be Catholic, Baptist,
Jewish or Methodist, if they fulfil the
needs of the people by bringing them
light they should be given subsistence i
for their labors. i
Touching upon the conditions In China
and the boycott of American goods, he
said this first national expression of hos
tility In China is. bitter and deepseated;
that the cause for It, the Chinese exclu
sion law, cannot safely be abandoned,
but that a diplomatic and friendly under
standing can be reached, and friendly re-Â«
lations be re-established; reasoning there
by: .. . â¢ '\u25a0-....
"The Chinaman wants to work and he
comes to America to get it. Teach him
that the best place in" the world forhiin
is China, where, under proper conditions
of government, he. could work with the
Bame rewards as - he can in America.
Teach him that,' If the government will
not provide means whereby he may work
and enjoy the fruits of his labors, to rise
up and destroy the government that fails
to fulfill the duties it' owes to its people.
And meanwhile, let us teach the yellow
man that we come not with implements I
to rob and plunder and. exploit him, but i
to serve him and lead him on the 1
higher plane of civilization that "we of'
the rest of the world enjoy. , And thus ,
will we redeem God's 'promise to man,*
and exemplify the principle of Justice I
throughout the, world." , :

Sagebrush Boys, Are Outclassed
by the Stanford Team.
PARK WINSLOW.
I Stanford made twenty-one points
i against the University of Nevada foot
i ball team at Palo Alto yesterday jn for
i ty-flve minutes of play. The boys . from
Â» the. desert did not even threaten' to score
iat any stage of the game. The Cardinal
] squad did considerably less than its best
'principally on accounttQf;theiheat. The
: contest was&b&iitinany'*lo* ?fcjr the same
reason. Stanford* took ' iheMead from the
start and after five minutes of play
there was never the slightest doubt as
to. which eleven would carry off thehon
: 0r5. ....:; . \u25a0 \u25a0*' r - Hf ' '
â¢ They* spectators, - who were practically
all Cardinal sympathizers, were given
plenty of opportunities to exult and
made the most of them. As a signboard
on the road to the. championship the con
test made the desired end look consider
ably nearer than , last Tuesday's game
with Oregon. Stanford kicked off and the
Sagebrushers carried the pigskin back
to their own twenty-five yard line, where
a kick was forced. Stanford got the ball
ten yards. on her own side of center and
worked it scoreward thirty yards on
line plays. Here the home team relaxed
while the visitors' line stiffened and the
ball went to Nevada.
The lads from over the eastern border
discovered the Cardinal weak, spots on
the left side and sent their backs through
for steady gains. Finally Stanford held
and Hussman made a child's sized punt
a little past center. Dole brought the
ball back ten yards before he was
downed. Hart of Nevada got through
the line on the sqcond play and downed
the runner for a big loss. The kick was
a necessity. Hussman muffed Fenton's
short fly and it was Stanford's ball on
the enemy's twenty-five yard line. \u25a0
KICKS EASY GOAL.
The Cardinal outfit concentrated Its
energies for a few minutes and carried
the pigskin steadily down the field to
within five yards of the goal line. Fen
ton dropped back after two charges of
the Cardinal had been repulsed and made
a nifty little drop kick between the goal
posts. Nevada, kicked off and Stanford
of Stanford made a brilliant run back of
twenty-five yards. The crorrd cheered
lustily and the speedy end smiled so gen
erously that it dlsclocated.lts head gear
and exposed the' Chauncey Depew part
to his hair.
The Cardinal carried the ball up' field
for, thirty yards and lost It on downs.
Hussman punted gently again and Stan
ford made a free catch. Crawford es
sayed to secure a field goal on a place
kick from the fifty-yard mark and went
short and wide of his target * Nevada
failed to gain and punted. The Lanagans
made another free catch and vainly tried
for another field goal from, the forty-yard
line. - â¢ . '
Nevada fumbled the ball on the \u25a0 ten
yard line. . Horton of Stanford fell on it.
Three ' plays' brought : the leather to the
goal posts and "Jim" j Crow was sent
through the line for a touchdown. Craw
ford kicked the 'goal. During the re
mainder "of the half, Nevada progressed
backward in a losing fight like Jimmy
Brltt at Colma, and .with half .a minute
to -play, Slusher- dove through tackle for
another .touchdown.. Fenton kicked the
goal., . : . .
: STANFOIID GETS LISTLESS.
After the ten* minutes of rest, the Car
dinal team seemed to have lost interest
and played 2 sluggishly. Whenever- the
home team took, a brace, the- visitors
were ."forced back. Finally Rook was
pushed j over. -for ~a touchdown and the
day's scoring was. at an end. Dole mis
cued in. frying to *kick; the- goal.. The
most prominent : feature of the last half
was the Stanford quarterback's , display
.of affection for -a j fake kick which had
previously; proved .- of value. , - ;
-The work of the Cardinal ends has im
proved considerably since Tuesday. They
were down with the punts every time and
smashed up Nevada's. interference in the
rushes, j The . left tackle and end seemed
as weak as ever on the defense when the
target. of line plays. Time and again on
the Stanford' offense as well, the boys
with the blue and , white apparel broke
through '. the Z Cardinal's fragile left.
Thompson, - the veteran guard, seemed .to
think the enemy Was easy . and ,- did not
overexert j himself. . Stanford played, well
at rlght'erid and Crawford acquitted him
self honorably at - right tackle. Brennan
tried right guard; yesterday and did well
at ;lt.\ He has .been shuffled Into almost ;
every position/ in the deck and should;
find a' permanent resting place soon. ]
IS SLOW-WITH SIGNALS.
Fenton makes an: excellent- quarterback
except ;- that he Is terribly slow at times
In giving his signals: Laumeister, who
succeeded him in yesterday's game, was
slower yet. To date, California is su
perior to Stanford in point of speedâ a
reversal of conditions . for the last two
', years. \u25a0 Chalmers did not play yesterday, j
but had he done so the score would have
been larger. I noticed the lack of spirit
and speed in the team in his absence
which are. there. when" he plays. Besides
that, he Is almost always good for a gain
poni the third do wri* with a yard or two
|to be annexed. His fellow backs cannot
| begin to hold their feet as well.
j - -Fenton may be the solution of the Car
dinal punting problem and Stott is likely
'toigo at end. Molfino played in cham
! pionship form yesterday at center. In
! fullback's position. Crow is .getting along
I nicely. The- lineup follows:

INDIANS EASY FOR BERKELEY.
California Qulrkly Rolln Up Twenty-
One PoiutH Asatnst Red Men.
: LOS. ANGELES, Oct. 21.â Berkeley
took a rather one-sided contest from
the Sherman Indians this afternoon
upon the Fiesta Park gridiron. Within
a few minutes after the ball was in
play It was evident that the university
eleven outclassed their opponents. The
Berkeley men, after measuring, the In
dians, confined, their game for the
greater part to bucking the line, and
never lost the ball upon downs, al
though forced to kick twice.
On the other hand, Sherman failed 'to
make their gains, and, as a mater -of
course, secured -possession of the pig
skin but few times during the, forty
minutes of actual play. In defensive
play they seemed unable to mass in a
manner which would stop the terrific
smashes against their lines and the
ball steadily advanced toward the
Sherman goal throughout the game.
Mead and Snedigar, the California
halves, accompanied the ball down the
field a large portion of the time,
smashing -through the left Indian
guard, hurdling or bucking the tackles
and heading wedge plays. Snedigar
made the longest distance, carrying the
ball twenty-live yards through a scat
tered field in the first half. Mead but
ted his way through seven of the In
dians for a sensational gain of fifteen
yards in the second half.
By, consistent head work the Califor
nians bucked the line and made two
touchdowns, a kicked goal and a field
goal In the first half. Finding the task
not difficult., the college substitutes
were called in for backs during the last
half and the eleven eased down, mak
ing but one touchdown and goal. It
was one of the cleanest games ever
played upon this gridiron.
There was but one man so. badly,in
jured as to be retired from the game.
He was Neaphus, the crack right half
of . the Sherman team. .He suffered a
broken rib and may be out of the game
several weeks. Lugo filled, his place
during the remaining play. ,

ard defeated West Point's football
eleven to-day by a score of 6 to 0. al
though the army team gained nearly
twice as much ground as their oppon
ents. Surpslresd by West Point's un
expected strong attack. Harvard waa
iv danger of defeat until late In tho
game, when she scored on a fumble by
West Point.
Although the play of both teams was
marked by fumbling and penalties, the
entire forty-five minutes T/aa filled
with spectacular runs and open -plays
which held an audience of severi|l
thousand spectators at a high pitch of
excitement. A gale of wind, which
swept the field lengthwise^ caught the
punts and frequently carried the ball
sailing: nearly fifty feet above the
ground for two-thirds of the gridiron's
length. The wind made it practically
impossible to catch the punts safely.

C. ZUBELIX WILL LECTURE >*;
IX CAI.iyOK.MA CLUB ROOMS
Professor of Sociology of the Inivcr
Â»lty of Chicago Will Speak oa
â¢â¢The Xtw Civic Spirit."
A lecture on "The New Civic Spirit"
will be given Wednesday evening
next at the California. Club rooms by
Charles Zubelin, professor of sociology
in the University of Chicago and author
Of "American Municipal Progress."
Mr. Zubelin Is a delightful talker and
his success in the East in stlrrlnar up
people's enthusiasm and pride In the
betterment of civic conditions has been
wonderful. In most large cities the
majority does not take interest or pride
enough In its city to care who governs
it or how it Is governed, whether the
public money is used for the moral and
physical advancement of the city or
merely to give politicians office.
At present there is an awakening go
ing on In this direction in San Fran
cisco and Mr. Zubelin will find the keen
est appreciation of his lectures. "The
Xew Civic* Spirit" on Wednesday and
the "Training or the Citizen" on -No
vember 1 are most timely and of espe
cial Interest, when the choosing of men
to make or mar our city is pending.
The California Club has made a very

PONY RACING
DRAWS SOCIETY
Spreckels and Clark Colors
Are First in Four Events
Itun at San. Mateo Track
\u25a0 Soekinff diversion from golf, tennis
and similar summer pastimes, society
largely attended the racing given un
der the auspices of the Calif orna Polo
and Pony Racing Association, held at
Charles W. Clark's San Mateo country
place yesterday. Five events were
down for decision and the judges, Col
onel D. M. Burns and Charles T. Boots,
were called upon to decide some very
close' finishes, the sport being exciting
enough to please the. most fastidiously
inclined. . > ' -
Racing honors fell to the stables of
Rudolph Spreckels and Charley Clark,
each capturing two of the numbers
run. W. E.- Pedley, a popular Southern
California sportsman^ took the odd with
the gay . , old campaigner, Carlotta.
Frank Skinner, the crack local rider,
and R. Mackey, the clever Australian,
divided the saddle' honors, each piloting
two winners. Charles Dunphy, another
top-notcher, donned the colors but
twice, contenting himself with one win
and a bang-up second.
Among the ultra-fashionables present
were: Mr. and Mrs. Peter Martin, ' Mr.
and Mrs. Cunningham, Mr. and Mrs.
.George Howard, Mr. and Mrs ? Willis
Polk. Miss Anita Harvey, Miss Mary
Ayer, Miss Beatrice Spiivalo, Miss Ellen

Powers, Will O'Connor, Clem Tobin,
J. O. Tobin, Cyril Tobin, E. J. Tobin.
Major Rathbone and William Rex.
On her two victories of the previous
Saturday, Leah, the mount of Mr.
Dunphy, looked almost a certainty for
the introductory quarter-mile handi
cap. The finish was of the hair-raising
sort, Mr. Mackey bringing Carlotta up
with a well timed rush, beating Leah
out a head. The- race throughout re
flected much credit on Handicapper
Robert Leighton. Helen Warwick,
with Mr. Marsh up, was a close third.
Paris mutuels paid $24 40 on $5 invest
ment. /
Mr. Dunphy had the leg up on Mid
love in the three-furlong spin, with but
three going to the post, and It resulted
in nothing more than a cake-walk for
the mare. Mr. Skinner landed Honoma
from the Spreckels stable, second, and
Ramona with Mr. Hayes up, finished
third. Mutuels paid $8 70.
All ponies look hllke to Rudolph
Spreckels' Ulctma. The Clark stable
folks pinned their hopes on the prowess
otfiia^ BlÂ»rtcg(t6''/b ea t^fb:e ghostlike
little YnareVbut were doomed to disap
pointment. They were the only two
starters in the four and a half furlong
dash and Ulctma. with Mr. Skinner in
,the. saddle, scored very handily in
:57 2-5, an excellent. perfomance,
weights considered. Paris mutuels paid
$7 40.
While at the post in the three and a
half furlong handicap Bas Blancs fell
with. "Mr. Mackey, and the luckless
rider, received a cut over one eye. He
pluckily remounted, but failed to finish
among the first three. Mr. Skinner,
wearing the cerise colors of Rudolph
Spreckels; rode an excellent race on
Althomer, winning ridden out from
Carlotta and Helen Warwick In :45,
cutting the association record half a
second. Mutuels paid $15 05.
The copper with silver cap bf Char
ley Clark was the whole thing in the
concluding six and a half furlong run,
securing first and third honors. Cou
pled with Chanate in the speculating
done, Ethel G, the mount of Mr. Mac
key, assumed' command in the stretch,
disposing of Carlolly with considerable
in reserve!' Chanate ran third. Mutu

j After reeling off fifteen rounds of
j ball that was punctuated by sensations
S*in v the line of good and bad ball, the
pCommuters and the Slwashes left the
! Eighth street lot yesterday with three
\u25a0 runs each. Darkness settled down on
I the park and but for that the teams
â¢ mlghjt still be battling to put the de-
I cisive run over.
I Most of the runs were the result of
bad fielding or dummy work on the
part of some one. The pitchers were
hit hard in a couple of innings, but I
then they settled down and twirled
ball that was great to behold and ,the
batsmen were mowed down -in rag
time order with a few exceptions.
The Commuters showed signs of life
and. braced up after the Stwashes took
1 the lead in the fourth. It looked then
as though the game was about in, for
the Oakland stars all seemed to be
taking a trip kito the heavens. But
they rallied later on and when they
did strike their gait they played the
game without falling down.
Seattle started to get busy in the
fourth when Hall beat out an infield
hit. Shields smashed one to Blexrud
and he tossed it to second, but Dunleavy
did not cover the bag and. both men
pulled up safe. Kane then dispatched
a single into right and after Hogan let
the ball get .through him both men
i arrived.
Jimmy Byrnes made the Oakland
fans happy in the fifth when he scored
Richards with a long triple ito the flag.
In . the next period, Kruger tore
through with a single and Dunleavy
unloaded a double to left. "Ball" Croll
let the ball get away from him and
while r lie was looking to pick it up
again, both runners rounded the last
turn. Oakland stored no more runs
after that time.
The Siwashes came through with
their final two and tangled up the re
sult in the eighth. Kane led off^with
a single and this seemed to unnerve
Air. Blexrud to such an extent that he
Issued free passes to .the next three
men, forcing Kane over.
Both teams tried to grab the
decisive run -"in the ensuing spasms,
but neither came anywhere near put
ting the big one "over. Both Shields
and Blexrud tossed 1 the right sort of
smoke and the batters were all be
wildered. When darkness set in after
the fifteenth had been gone through,
Umpire Davis told the fans to go home
to supper and come back some other
time to see the fun. The score:

OFTEN LEAD TO CANCER
The deepj underling cause for every old sore is a bad condition of the blood.' This^l
vital fluid is not pure and healthy, but has become infected with some germ or poison which
prevents the place from healing. , These poisons in the blood maybe the result of an in-
active or sluggish condition of the system, leaving the refuse matters in the body to be al>
sorbed into the circulation, instead of throwing them off through the usual channels of nature.
Another cause is the weakening or polluting of this life stream by the remains of some consti-
tutional trouble, or the effects of a long spell of sickness.
When the blood is in this condition, a great running sore or deep offensive ulcer may
develop from a slight scratch, bruise or pimple ; a harmless looking wart or mole, roughly \u25a0
handled, of ten becomes an ulcerating spot which may degenerate into Cancer dangerous and de-
structive. Persons with inherited blood taint

sores and ulcers are is best known by those
who have treated and nursed one for j^ears, applying salves, lotions, plasters, etc., with no
good results. The place remains and continues its work of destruction by eatino- deeper
into the surrounding flesh; festering, discharging, requiring constant attention, and under-
mining the general health by its action on the system. One of the most common evidences <*~
of impure blood is dry sores, which are usually on the face. These continue sometimes for
years with apparently no change, the scab dropping off and re-forming at intervals; but when
the vital energies begin to weaken, the place grows red tender, a slight discharge com-
mences, it takes on an angry, inflamed appearance, and usually terminates in Cancer.
It is a waste of valuable time to treat these places with external applications and ex-
pect a cure. True these keep the parts clean and are beneficial in this way, but they do' not
reach the real trouble. You may glaze the surface over with them for awhile, but the poison
is at work deeper down, and constantly eating, nearer the vital parts and damaging the en-
tire health. The practice of cutting out the diseased parts and scraping the bone is often
resorted to, but even these severe measures do no good. The sore may be removed, and for
a time heal over, but the same poison which produced it the first time is still in the blood
and it will return, because THE BLOOD CANNOT BE GUT AWA Ym

OAKLAND TAKES
THE FIELD BAY
Youths From Over the Pond
LeacPlowell Boys by Five
Points -in a Fast Test
Amid wild enthusiasm of over 3000
spectators the sturdy lads from the
Oakland High School took the twenty
third semi-annual field day of the Aca
demic Athletic League of California
yesterday afternoon on the Berkeley
cinderpath.
Never before was such a field day
held by thia league. Great credit is
due to. Will L. Pqtls, secretary of the
league, who is responsible for its suc
cess.
The races and Held events were" of
the highest order and rarely were the
contestants far apart. While they were
closely contested, not a record was
broken. In the hundred Pomeroy of
Palo Alto had no difficulty in defeating
his competitors, but the 440-yard dash
was a different proposition, ending al
most in a head heat. Walker, who got
second place In this race, was disquali
fied and had to give his position to Wil
son of Santa Rosa.
â¢ The only hitch that occurred was In
the 120-yard hurdles. When the final
heat was run off Dignan of Santa Rosa
came In first, Peaslee of Oakland sec
ond and Ruddick of Ukiah third. An
error occurred In placing the hurdles,
which made one In Peaslee's 'course
farther away than it should be. The
race was ordered to be run over again,
so Peaslee, Instead of being second, won
out; Dignan got second instead of third
and Ruddlck got third Instead of first.
By far the closest race of the day
was the SSO-yard dash. Mayes of Lick
led the way the entire course to within
four yards of the finish, when Free of
Oakland stepped out from behind him
and sprinted for the tape, winning
handily.
Buttgenbach. the Lowell sprinter,
ran a fine race in the 220-yard dash,
beating Pomeroy by about an inch.
In the field events nothing remark
able happened. The points gained by
each school;
Oakland 24, Lowell 19,. Santa Rosa 14 1-3
San Jose \i, Berkeley 12, Alaraeda 11, Ukiah
10, Lick 9 1-3, Palo Alto Â», Cogswell 4 1-3.
The winners were as follows:

Honors in Dashing Style
DOUBLES SET DECIDED
Mi Long and Gardner Outplay
H. Long and 3litchell in
Decisive Bound of Match
Two tennis tournaments were completed
en the local courts yesterday. At the
park thÂ© Juveniles played the semi-finals
and finals of the handicap singles tour
nament commenced last Saturday. As
usual, Maurice McLoughlin carried off the
honors, al though he did not do so as
easily as in the past. At the California
Club the final match of the handicap
doubles tournament, commenced a month
Pago, was played. The match had been
postponed a number of times, as several
of the contestants were in the competi
tion for the bay counties championship
Â«tt the pGrk. Last Sunday through a
misunderstand ing th# match was given to
Herbert Long and Frank Mitchell by de
fault.
In the match played yesterday Long
end Mitchell had for opponents Melville
Long and Carl Gardner. Both played
from IS 8-6 behind scratch throughout the
tournament and the finals brought them
together on even terms.. M. Long and
Gardner won. quite handily, taking threÂ«
cots out of four. The score was 6-1, 6-3,
&-7. 6-2.
Both Mitchell and H. Long were rather
unsteady and made numerous errors.
They were outplayed at all stages of the
came. The victors essayed the net po
sition and did some excellent volleying
fe-r.d cmashing.
By far the best match of the boys*
tournament occurred in the semi-finals
â¢when Moris JlcLoughlin and Robert
Btrachan came together. The latter re
ceived owe odds of 15 and was beaten
by a very narrow margin. The champion I
had his hands full at all times and on
several occasions looked marked for de
feat. Strachan played better than ever i
before and was by no means outclassed.
He won the second se{ easily and in the
first and third sets led until almost the
end. In the final set Strachan had the
pcore 5-4 in his favor, but McLoughlin
put up a groat finfeh and won three
ttraight games.
In the finals Levinson, with the same
\u25ba as Strachan, failed to make as good
a showing againpt McLoughlin. The lat
ter won the first eet easily, but was
forced to a deuce set in the second. The
score was 0-3, 7-5.
McLough'.in's victory makes his third
in this kind of a tournament and the
Manager's Cup, presented to the club by
Mr. Marvin, goes to the little champion
for all time.

IJMI> Delanry Calls a Halt In Time to
Save the Bit; Sparring:
Partner.
Rough boxing was in order at Camp
Kaufmann, Alameda, yesterday after
noon, when Al Kaufmann and Joe Ken
nedy donned the mittens for a three
round bout as a tinale to the day's
work. The affair might have ended
disastrously for big Joe Kennedy had
not Billy Delaney called a halt just
in the nick of time. Joe and Al went
lat it hammer and tongs, much to the
Aoelight of a number of spectators, and
worse lights than the two put up have
been seen at Woodward's Pavilion.
Kaufmann's work during the bout
â¢was an agreeable surprise to his
friends. None of his blows were wasted
and in another moment Kennedy might
have been' in slumberland had it not
been for the timely voice of Billy De
laney. Al's footwork showed consider
able improvement, and his condition
appeared to be almost perfect. Kauf
mann will be a surprise to those who
think he cannot go the route. The
young fellow conducts himself like a
man who has fought a hundred battles
instead of seven short one-round af
fairs.

MARKET IS VERT ACTIVE
IN SOUTHSIDE PROPERTY
Several Sales Made on Fifth Street,
Where a Boom Seems to Be On.
Many Transactions of Good Size Are
Reported in All Parts of the City.
That the activity in the South of Mar
ket district still continues is shown by
the many sales made in this section dur
ing the past week, a great number of
which have been consummated through
the office of Davidson & Leigh. That
Fifth street in particular .is coming to
the front as a field for investment is in
dicated by the great number of sales
along this street in which the above firm
has figured. The well suostantiated ru
mors afloat regarding the removal of the
old gas works, located at the corner of
Fifth and Howard streets and the con
templated improvements along this thor
oughfare, has been sufficient to attract
the attention of the leading capitalists of
the city. And when the location of this
street is taken into consideration and that
its property can be bought to-day at fully
fifty per cent less than the prices which
are being paid on Third. Fourth. Sixth
or Ninth streets, it is only reasonable
to assume that within a short time the
values on the street will be materially
increased.
The foremost and perhaps the most in
teresting sale "of the week was that of

SCHEDULE OK ASSOCIATION
FOOTBALLERS IS SETTLED
Eisrht Clalis Will Play fur the Comlns
Scaxoii'.i <-'liniiii>ioiislt;ii of | the
California League.
After considerable doubt it is now
settled that eight clubs will play for
the 1905-1906 championship of the Cal
ifornia Association Football. League,
viz.: the Albion Rovers, the Alameda
Eagles, the Va^mpires, the Independents,
the San Franciscos, the Oakland Hor
nets, the Sacramento and Santa Cruz
clubs. Neither the Occidentals nor tho
Scottish Thistles have come into the
league, but. some of the men who
would have represented these clubs will
play for the Oakland Hornets.
The committee handed in the schedule
at the last meeting. It was accepted.
There is still a- difficulty in finding
grounds on which to play. It is not
certain that Idora Park. Oakland, or
the Presidio Athletic Grounds In this
city can be. obtained. The committee on
grounds applied to the Park Commis
sioners for leave to play, on Lobos
Square at Chestnut and Laguna streets,
but the Commissioners at 'their last
meeting refused permission, fearing
that the grounds might bn damaged.
The Vampires and Eagles will play on
the cricket ground at Webster street,
*Alameda; the Independents and Albion
Rovers will share Freeman's Park,
Golden Gate, but two more grounds am
wanted. According to the schedule,
three matches will be played 'on Sun
day, November 5; four on Sunday, No
vember "12; three on Sunday,; No
vember 19, v and four on Sunday,
November 22. After that date It is'pro
posed to' play four matches > each Sun
day until February IS. 190 R. on which
day.:one game will be played. One will
also be_ played on February 2E. Some
of the matches will bo played at Sacra
mento and others at Santa Cruz.

Berkeley High School football teams
decided to sostpone the game that . was
to take place yesterday till next Sat

WARD WOMAN
PROVES ALIBI
S T ot the Accomplice of
Andrews in the Attempt
to Murder William^ Ellis
Special Dispatch to The Call.
| DENVER, Colo., Oct. 21.â When a tele
gram reached the authorities here to
day that William Ellis, victim of the
Berkeley (Cal.) slugging, and two other
persons had Identified a picture of Miss
Julia Ward of Denver as that of the
woman who was with Milton Franklin
Andrews when the assault was commit
ted, "efforts to discover the young woman
were redoubled...
To-night she gave the officers a surprise
by appearing at . police headquarters,
thoroughly angry. She is Mrs. Julia
Darby now, lives at 2230 Champa street,
and has three children. The picture sent
to California is one of her, having been
used when she disappeared several years
ago from a lodging-house. She denies
knowing : Andrews or having been out of
Denver, and vows' vengeance on those
who have implicated her.
Despite the alleged identification of the
picture at Berkeley, it is evident that a
blunder has been made, as Mrs. â¢ Darby
has a splendid alibi.
MADEID DECORATED.
IN HONOE OF LOUBET
All Classes Unite in Extend
ing a Welcome to the
French Chief .
MADRID, Oct. 21.â This city Is superbly
decorated in honor of President Loubet,
who will arrive here on Monday to re
turn King Alfonso's ,vislt to France. The
meeting of the two rulers will be the oc
casion for a notable national demonstra
tion and a series of brilliant ' spectacles.
Business practically will be suspended' for
a week. The Cortes has prorogued Its
sittings for a week and all classes. In
cluding Republicans, Radicals and So
cialists, are uniting to welcome the French
President. Considerable political signifi
cance is attached to the visit, owing to
the recent Franco-Spanish agreement and
the reciprocation of the two countries
relative to Morocco. Premier Rouvler's
accompanying M. Loubet will give the
trip a distinctly political aspect.
In Madrid the houses are covered with
bunting, especially along the routes thÂ«
President will follow.
The police have adopted strict precau*
tlons to -prevent a repetition "of anarchis
tic outrages. The railroads are strictly
guarded from "end to end, while suspect
ed persons are kept under rigid surveil
lance. \u25a0 . .
The city is crowded with visitors.
Among the notable .arrivals are the two
French cavalary officers whose horses
were killed when the anarchistic attempt
was made against King Alfonso's life in
Paris. The King especially invited the
officers, who received an enthusiastic wel
come.
Four years ago a man came to us with a bad rupture of many
years' standing. We told him we could XURE him. He was skep-
tical, but consented to try our No Cure No- Pay plan. Here is
what he says now:^^^^
"I will say that since vou 'CURED me, four years ago, I
have tied, weighed and handled 9384 tons of hay, besides having
done other kinds of hard work, and have never since experienced
any ! inconvenience from the Rupture, it. being CURED for- hard
work as well: as leisure." . . - _ .

on faunday and 0:1 Monday cold It, and now
you could not buy It without paying a geod
advance, and that is psrfecly proper, for it is

I am the great Fanchon. the greatest and

world; am th* seventh son of a seventh son;
born' with a caul: I predicted under the In-

judge somewhat of my merits beforehand." I
now predict for th* month of November thÂ«
greatest activity In thÂ« stock market that
ha* been known for years; Con. Virginia and
Ophlr taking the lead; the former will have
an unprecedented rise; watch and see If th*
great Fanchon is worthy of belief. My ad-

REDLANDS, Oct. 21.â The Presbyterian
Synod of California will meet at San
Rafael next year, the selection having
been made this morning. Miss Cameron
spoke to-day on the Chinese Rescue
Home at San Francisco, - telling of the
work of evangalization through the re
turn to China of rescued girls. In an
address Rev. J. H. Laughlin of San Fran

SARAH BERXHARDT ROASTS
COWARDICE OF STERNER SEX
Famtni Actress Writes of Her Exper
ience on Board a Liner Dur
ing a Hurricane.
PARIS, Oct. 21.â Mme. Sarah Bernhardt
has never been an admirer of the sterner
sex, but after her recent trip to Buenos
Ayres she thinks even less of men than
before. When nearing the coast of South
America the liner on which she traveled
was caught in a terrific hurricane, and
the captain informed his passengers that
he had no hope of saving his vessel from
going to the bottom.
"The way in which the men, sailors as
well as passengers, behaved," she writes,
"was disgusting. Their faces pale with
terror, they knelt in prayer on the decks,
crying and whimpering in the most
cowardly manner. I felt proud of my sex
when I saw that after the shock of the
announcement that our ship was doomed
the women were by far more cool and
brave than the men." That, we did not
go to the bottom was a miracle, as every
man of the crew had left his post to
wring his hands in despair, and the ship
was tossed like a cork in the trough of
the sea.
"Still moro disgusting was their brag
ging after the danger was over, 7 when
every one tried to convince every one
else that he had not been frightened at
all."
Art of Wife-Beatlnff.
LONDON, Oct. 21.â According to Scotch
law as just expounded by Judge McKevie
of Leith, "If a woman requires to be
chastised the husband should take a strap
to her and not use his hand." The oc
casion of this" weighty pronouncement
was the appearance before him of one
Patrick McManus on a charge of having
assaulted his wife. McManus knocked her
down with his lists and kicked her in the
side-while she lay on the ground. Ignor
ance'of the law Is usually held to be no
excuse, but apparently it sufficed in Mc-
Manus* case, for 'after admonishing him
to give the preference to the strap here
after the magistrate discharged" him.
English justice has long been remarkable
for its >eniency to wife-beaters, but now
Scotch Justice, it seems, takes a still more
merciful view of their offenses. In both
lands . a man is Invariably far more
severely punished for poaching, even
though he catches \u25a0no game, than he is
for thrashing his wife, however "brutal
and unprovoked the assault.
Will Be: No More Starvation.
ROME, Oct. 'Si. â Borne Is".: soon to
have the "bread house," which was
promised the Eternal City - last year.
The ; idea', on which the unique charity
rests is that man comes into the world
\u25a0with the light toe.at. so this is :to be
a.baker, giving bread to those -who; can
not buy. and furnishing it 1 to the poor
who can at a price which I , will leave
the smallest margin, of. profit. It is also
Intended to provide charitable '* insti
tutions with the bread at the same low
price; and it is calculated that the small
profit realized on the sales will pay the
cost of what Is given gratuitously. , .
When the "bread house" Is , In good
working order,' similar -Instltutlons i will
be established In other towns until even
the smallest j village in Italy ; will ; have
Its "bread house." and'death from atar
vatlon will be an impossibility.

NOT ACCOUNTED FOR
Barge Tasmania Goes Down
With Her Crew of Eight
Men After Terrible battle
With Gale- Whipped Water
CHICAGO, Oct. 21.â Later returns from
the storm which swept over the Great
Lakes for thirty-six hours, subsiding this
morning, increase the known death list
to twenty-one and the number of vessels
either lost or damaged to forty-two. Sev
eral small craft are missing, and it is
leared that the death list will grow.
It is feared that the steamship Prog
ress, which sailed from Aahland, Wis.,
last Sunday, went down on Lake Su
perior during the storm. The boat was
commanded by Captain Thomas Brady
of Detroit. She carried a crew of 15
men.
Oct. 21.â The steamship
Bulgaria came into port this , afternoon,
bringing news of the loss of the barge
Tasmania off Pelce Island, in Lake Erie,
during Friday's storm. The Tasmania
sank at 5 a. m. on Friday with her entire
crew of eight men.
The Tasmania, together with the barge
Ashland, carrying a crew of eight men,
were in tow of the Bulgaria. The Bul
garia and the Ashland rode the storm off
Pelee Island all day Friday and Friday
night, and early to-day started for Cleve
lan, arriving here at 2 p. m.
The storm came up so suddenly that It
found^ the* crews unprepared. The dark
ness Of night hung over the lake. The
wind rose with a fearful suddennes. howl
ing and sweeping around the boats. The
lake became mountainous. The boats
were tossed about at the will of the
storm. It looked for a time as if all
would be lost. The Ashland could dimly_
see the Tasmania. One moment she rode
toward it on great waves, another mo
ment she receded in the trough of the sea.
On board the Ashland the men were
keeping from being washed into the sea
only by clinging to objects on deck. It
was seen that the line to the Ashland
must be cut. One of the crew made his
way to the stern. With a knife he
reached down and severed the line. The
end of it dropped away out of sight. That
was the last tho crew of the Ashland saw
of tho other boat.. It seemed that she
sank at once.
BUFFALO. N. V., -Oct. 21.â The ship
Siberia from Cleveland foundered on the
Canadian shore of Lake Erie this aft

Marquette No. IS. Two of . the crew,
William Thomas and Iver Olesen, were
drowned. .
MARQUETTE, Mich., Oct. 21.â The

DARMSTADT, Oct. 21.â The Czar and
Czarina are expected here in the course
of a few weeks, and hasty preparations
are being made to receive them at the
Grand Ducal Palace. The Czarina is a
Hessian Princess, and is sister to the
Grand Duke of Hesse. ' She is extremely

also likes coming here, where he finds
rest and refuge from state worries.
The Grand Ducal family live here in
the simplest manner, taking walks in the
neighborhood and automobillng over to
Frankfort, Homburg and Cronberg, and
nobody pays any particular attention to
them. ' '\u0084.
The imperial couple. will share this un
pretentious life." 'The Czarina's visit this
time is of particular interest to. the people
who have known her since childhood, as
she is again expecting an interesting
event.

The American Duchess.
LONDON, Oct. 21.â 1n British journals

HIGH TREASON
IS THE CHARGE
Private Secretary of Baron
Banffy, Former Hungarian
HIS MASTER INVOLVED
Pamphlet Urging the Over
throw of the Hapsburg
Dynasty Causes Trouble
BUDAPEST, Hungary, Oct. 21.â Nemed
Denes, private secretary, of Baron Banffy,
the former Premier, was arrested to-day
on the charge of high treason.
The arrest of Denes arises from his
publication a month ago of the pamphlet
entitled "The Hungarian Crisis and the
Hohenzollerns," In which the overthrow of
the Hapsburgs and the establishment of
the Hohenzollern dynstay in Hungary was
represented as the only way to the pros
perity of Hungary. Baron Banffy has
been openly charged with having sanc
tioned the publication, but denied it in
most positive terms. It Is said that "the
police seized a letter in Baron BanfTy's
handwriting in the rooms of the author of
the; pamphlet.
It was announced from Budapest on
September 12 that Baron Banffy, formerly
Hungarian Prime Minister, royal court
marshal and King's chamberlain, and re
cently one of the leaders of the united
opposition in the Hungarian Parliament,
seemed to be seriously compromised as
the result of an investigation made by
the police of Budapest into the case of
a Budapest journalist, Julius Arpad Zig
any, who had written a pamphlet asking
the Hungarians to depose the Hapsburg
dynasty and to elect the German Em
peror's second son. Prince Eltel Fred
erick, as King. The pamphlet, which
was published in Berlin, caused a great
sensation and aroused considerable in
dignation. It was confiscated throughout
the whole of the dual realm. A letter
was found on Zigany, who is under ar
rest, from which it appeared that Baron
Banffy at least favored the publication
of the pamphlet, if it was not inspired by
him. The following day the Baron issued
an emphatic denial that he had any con
nection with the pamphlet.

PARIS, Oct. 21. â Another m.in.now

Gazel, who is father of five girls and

how to provide a dot for his daugh

the public through the press that he
intends to give a few bank notes to

sions when special festivities have been
arranged this has happened.
But he is a great favorite with the
royal children, having at once won
their hearts by letting them play with
his excellent collection of diamonds

BERLIN, Oct. 21.â The meat famine is

cattle being in vain. In many parts of
Germany the hedgehog has almost been
exterminated as a consequence of the
meat famine. Poor persons organize reg

palatable, tasting very much like tender

and himself was the result of a private
quarrel. .
What In Hanger Scientifically?
Hunger is the sensation felt because of
the contraction of the muscularis either
of the pylorus or possibly also the entire
stomach or of the duodendum, or of the
contraction of the muscularis of all these
structures. If the contraction is more in
tense it is felt as a painful hunger. If
the contraction is slight, then the sensa
tion of the hunger is also of a slight de
gree; it is evanescent.
Hunger is a lesser degree of pain and Is
produced by the contraction of the" mus
cularis. This is the reason why hunger
passes away after a certain lapse of time,
even if no food has been taken; it means,
simply, that the muscularis becomes Ured
and contraction gives way to relaxation^
Absence of contraction, the inability, to
contract; relaxation, distentionâ these be
ing the oppositeâ the reverse of contrac
tion results in the opposite of appetite,
anorexlai . provided, however, .that such
distention is not caused. by an overabund
ance of â¢ the irritating acid gases. Ano
rexia is , the sensory symptom of,disten
tion,of the stomach and upper portion of
the intestines by non-irritating gases, ac
companied by I complete or partial , relaxa
tion; of. the sphincter. This is the condi
tion Jwe observe in .chronic pyloritis,

CHIEF AMONG
ALL THE DRUGS
Quinine Has Proved a Great
Blessing to Fever Stricken
People of Indian Plains
CUT DEATH BATE . LOW
Plant Indigenous to South
America Now Cultivated on
Slopes of the Himalayas
Quinine is one of tha most valuable
of all the drugs known to medical sci
ence.
No one would venture to travel in In
dia without it. Before its discovery
2,000,000 people died annually in India
of malarial fever; the mortality from
this cause is now less than half that
number.
The"poor people â so poor that they
looked upon the fever as their fate and
expected no relicf â are saved by the
agency of quinine. England could not
keep her European soldiers in India
without It
Livingstone and other travelers In
Central Africa could have never made
their discoveries without its aid. It is
said of the great German explorer
Schweinfurth that when he lost his en
tire property by fire, valuable scien
tific instruments among the rest; he felt
the loss of his quinine to be the great
est of all, and often thought with feai
of the journey that lay before him.
which, however, he persevered in.
The soldiers in the American Civil
War depended- greatly upon quinine.
The pioneers in this country when It
was first settled and civilized had as
hard work fighting fever and ague In
the then swampy, malarial districts as
in fighting Indians, and quinine was
even more necessary than firearms.
NEEDED OX PANAMA CANAL.
The great interoccanic canal bow In pro
cess of construction across the Isthmus
of Panama requires the labor of thou
sands of men largely unaccustomed to the
climate and so much more susceptible to
its 111 ettezt. Before the route was de
cided upon many surveys were made and
the men, naval officers and others engaged
in the work, were exposed to all condi
tions of weather. But through the uni
versal and proper use of the medicine
daily as a precautionary measure .the
mortality was no greater than among
men in like employ in other localities. Out
of a little over 6000 white men employed In
the construction of the Panama Railroad
there were only 293 deaths, and some of
these were the Â» result of other than cli
matic causes!
The whole world is indebted to the cin
chona tree, from which quinine is made.
Who could have foretold that this tree, a
native of the mountainous forests of
South America, would be .of such import
ance In the advance of civilization and
Christianity?
Its safe transportation from one side of
the world to the other and the success
attained in converting a wild into a culti
vated plant and naturalizing it reads like
a romance. One of the strange things
about quinine is that it is not used as a
medicine In the practice of the native phy
sicians of Peru, Ecuador or Colombia.
CALLED BY 3IAXV JTAMES.
The native Indians did not even
know of its curative property till en
lightened by the Spaniards about 250
years ago. They called the chinchona
tree kina, from which comes the word
quinine. What do you call it â kwine.
kin-nine. keen-neen or kln-neen?
What a lot of names the drug has had!
China bark, quina, quinquina, chin
chona, countess powder, Jesuit's bark.
Cardinal de Lugo's powder, Peruvian
bark, etc.
Great fortunes have been made out
of it. At the time when Louis XIV
purchased the secret a pound of the
bark cost about $50. As it came into
general use it became a most important
article of export from Peru. Now it is
successfully cultivated in Ceylon and
Java.
"As a means of guarding the system
from Intermittent fever the English
naval regulations require that every
man should take a potion of the drug
when the ship is within a certain dis
tance of the east or west coast of Af
rica, and that it should be regularly
taken by those engaged in boat-cruis
ing- alons the coasts or in the rivers
or creeks.
We may say with as much truth now
as did Lambert in 1820: "The treasures
which Peru yields and which the Span
iards sought and dug out of the bowels
of the earth are not to be compared
for utility with the bark of the quin
quina tree, which they for a long time
ignored." â¢
PHEJJOMEXOX OF SUXBIIBX
SAID TO I)B A MIRACLE
Old Sol's UajH Have Xo Effect on
an Already Tanned
Stln.
There are certain arctic animals, dark
coated in the short summer, that in win
ter turn pure white, thus matching the
snow covered landscape and escaping no
tice and harm.
This change of color, this protection,
effected no one knows how, is wonderful,
as wonderful as a miracle, yet a kindred
change of color, a kindred protection, hap
pens among mankind every summer and
nobody ever notices it.
When the pale city people go out in the
summer sun at the seashore or the moun
tains the light attacks them fiercely, first
reddening their skin, then swelling, blis
tering and scorching it. If they kept in
the sun enough and if no miracle oc
curred the light would kill them finally,
burning off the skin first and afterward
attacking the raw flesh. .-/V*
But a miracle docs occur. The skin
changes from a pale color to a tan and
on this tan the sun has no effect. The
sun may beat on tan colored skin for days
and weeks, but such skin remains always
sound, unblistered, whole.
Thus nature works a miracle. The
white skin is suffering, and nature, aware
somehow that a tan skin Is sunproof,
changes to tan the white. How does she
do this?" Where did she learn that it was
wise to do this? No one knows. Only
the fact of the miracle remains.
To prove this miracle â to prove' that it
is not the hardening of the skin, but the
change in its color which protects it from
sunburnâ is an easy matter.
Let a pale person, unused to the sun,
stain one side of his face yellow, and,
leaving the other side untouched, go out
in- the bright summer sun for a few hours.
The one side of his face is no tougher,
; no more hardened, than the other, yet
the unstained side will be inflamed, blis
tered, while the tan colored one will be
quite cool and unhurt.
Sunburn is a miracle, a protection to
mankind, as inexplicable and as wonder
ful as the miracle of the arctic animals*
change in the winter from dark coats to
snow white ones.

WHEN THE OLD DEVIL
IS LOOSE IN MEXICO
Strance Snnerstitlona of Many of the
People In Regard to His Satanic
Majesty.
A big fire, a suicide and a number cf
accidents in the city and a heavy wind
and rain storm here and numerous
crimes and accidents in many parts ot^
the republic were the natural conse
quences, It is to be supposed, of the an
nual one day's leave of absence taken
by his diabolical majesty, the devil,
recently â a leave of absence which
his majesty sptiiyls in this earthly plan
et doing a number of devilish tricks.
It is a common belief among almost
all Mexicans that on the day of San
Bartolo the devil is loose and
many unpleasant things happen.
The devil is supposed to be very
busy all the year around roasting
bad people in the inferno, but on the
day of San Bartolo he takes a little rest
and come 3 to the earth to see how
things are going on. That is, he comes
on a trip of inspection to see tne pros
pects for the coming year.
>lany people are so superstitious
about this that they stay at home nil
day and refuse to receive calls because,
according to tradition, it occurred one
time that the devil disguised himself
and called upon people whom he want
ed to carry away. The object of the
visit was briefly explained and the in
terested parties were so scared that
most of them dropped dead, whereupon
the devil carried away their souls.
The superstition is much more widely
spread in the States of the Interior. In
Guadalajara, for instance, they claim
that San Bartolo's is the day when the
city shall be destroyed by a flood and
a hurricane, according to the prediction
of a priest "who died many years ago.
although nobody knows the name of
that prophet nor the year when he made .
his prophecy.
Deserve to Be Drammed Oat.
The young officer who contracts debts
without hope or intention of repaying
them is a dead beat and a scoundrel, no
matter how many Filipinos he has kmed
or how well he can dance. He should be
drummed from the army like any other
rascal. That his decent fellow officers
are now compelled to associate with hi*n
on terms of equality is disgraceful. In
all probability the desire to splurge an.l
splurge and shine makes beats and
grafters of so many young officers. In
the navy the temptation is scarcely l^ss,
and every resident of Annapolis knows
stories in point about the youngsters at
the naval academy â not the midshipmen,
but the junior bachelor officers. That some
effort should be made to lessen those
temptations and to pluck out the woak
lings who yield to them is plain. It is
important beyond all thinga that the
army and the navy be officered by gentle
men. The man who swindles a creditor
should be cashiered as quickly as the
man who steals a watch.â Baltimore Her

Plain "Mister" Out ot Fashion.
An American journalist, returning after
an absence of some years abroad, com
ments upon the profuse application of
titles which is becoming frequent in this
country. The practice is essentially a
modern one. Daniel Webster. In his life
time, was never spoken of as "Senatjr"
Webster, but always as plain "Mr." Web
ster. Nowadays, however, it is invariably
"Senator" this and that; and almost ev
erybody has some kind of a handle to his
name. Thus we have "Forecaster" Jonts,
"Undertaker" Smith. "Conductor" Robin
son, "Superintendent of the Poorhouse"
Brown, common Councilman" Shucks,
and "Selectman" Bumps, and so on. If
this^kind of thing keeps on. we shall â¬nd
by resting our claims to respect and con
sideration upon those painfully mlnuta
social distinctions which prevail In Ger
many, where men or women inscribe their
narma in hotel registers with the addi
tion of such descriptive phrases as
"cousin to an apothecary/* or "brother
in-law to a corpora!."â Boston Herald.

SAYS HEARST IS GUILTY
OF DEEP INGRATITUDE.
Cunningham Takes
a Whack at
Editor.
Declares McClellan
Will Easily Be
Victory \
OAKLAND, Oct. 21.â "1t is a mean
thing for any man to turn upon those
who have befriended him. That is the
way many of the leaders of Tammany
Hall feel toward W. R. Hearst. There
have. In my opinion, been few men more
ungrateful to those who have placed
him In power than has this aspiring
editor."
It was with these words that former
Senator T. F. Cunningham of New York
in an interview in this city, character
ized the flght of William Randolph
Hearst for the Mayor's chair in New
York City.
"Tammany placed Hearst in the halls
of Congress," continued Senator Cun
ningham, "but how has he returned this
favor? He has fought two men whom
the organization in New York has in
dorsed for tlie Mayoralty. He was a fac
tor in the defeat of Van Wyck. How,
then, should Tammany feel toward him?
"Hearst has as much chance of be
coming Mayor of New York as he had
of becoming President of the United
States. He thinks that by his candi
dacy he can weaken McClellan. That, I
think, is his only object. I believe that
ii is a personal matter between Mc-
Clelland and Hearst and that Hearst,
is not against Tammany further than
to harm his personal enemies.
I'll EDICTS MeCLELLAN'S . ' VICTOR yI
"His candidacy will-simply strengthen
McClellan. He cannot influence the' Re
publican vote, which will be about
nominal this year. Hearst will get a
certain percentage of the votes of both
parties and McClellan will be elected
by an unusual majority. I am saying
this from a distance, but I know the
conditions well". â¢ â¢
"Charles F. Murphy, the leader of
Tamany, has shown a disposition to
treat everybody well; particularly the
newspapers', whatever their political
persuasions. He has even treated
Hearst, who has twice undertaken to
overthrow Tammany's candidate for
Mayor, well. Murphy and McClellan
will lead the organization to victory.
"Even with all -this fighting-, I do not
think Hearst has anything against the
organization â he has personal grudges
to satisfy. \u25a0 .
PLAYS BOTH E.YDS.
"The people of New York have no
fault to find with the administration
of Mayor McClellan. He has worked in
the interests of the whole people and
even the Republicans have acknowl
edged that fact. The organization of
Tammany Hall has never been In bet
ter condition than under the leadership
of Charles F. Murphy.
"I am not very well acquainted with"
the local political conditions in San
Francisco, but from a casual observa
tion of the attitude of Mr. Hearst's
paper here I would say that he is try-
Ing to' be one thing at one end of the
continent and another thing at the
other end.
"Next to New York, San Francisco
is the greatest city in the United States.
It has a great future for its harbor, and
the trans-Pacific trade will grow, as
did the trans-Atlantic trade, and that
will make San Francisco one of the
greatest ports of the world."
This is not Mr, Cunningham's, first
visit to California. He was a resident
of this State In the early '80's and was
for a time in business in San. Francisco.
He then went to New York, where he
became identified with politics and has
been one of the leaders of Tammany
Hall. He is now traveling in this State
for his health.

STRENGTHSHOWN

jiilief Generally Expressed
That the Strain in the
Moiiej Market Has Passed
SPECULATIVE REVIVAL
Greatest Advance Appears in
the Securities Which Call
for Smaller Investments
ICEW YORK, Oct. Â£I.â The whole stock
lift shared In the strength and anima
tion to-day, but not In equal degree, th?
gsmo marked partiality being shown for
low-priced stock? as in the active review
of speculation yesterday. A large major
ity of the widest movements to-day will
be found among stocks Felling below
60. The preference is due to the idea thnt
less money will "no required to carry this
ciass of stocks on margin during the
clofp conditions in the money markets.
Tills represents the rpirit of concession
to the remaining uncertainties over the
money outlook in entering upon the at
tempt at speculative revival. The revival
Is based, however, upon the expectations
that \hc strain in the money market
has passed and that other conditions may
now be looked forward to.
The bank state me:n did not come fully
up to expectations in its strong features,
but the recuperation disclosed was ac
cepted in the Epeculatlon as of good
premise. The increase in cash of 11.797.
200 was only about one-third what was
expected In the preliminary estimates and
the current comment on the Stock Ex
change explained this as being due to
the larger part of the receipts coming
in the latter part of the week.
The tone of the foreign money mar
fcc!* was also rasier and stocks were
benefited accordingly. In spite of the
dull business of Saturday, foreign ex
change rates ma Co a further aggressive
advance here ard the possibility of an
early export of gold received additional
discussion. The stock market, however,
â¢was unaffected by this consideration and
closed sctive and strong. Total sales of
bonds, par value, 52,2?0.000.
Prices of stocks have backed and filled
through the week without getting far
from a given level ln either direction.
There has been evidence of a waiting
6p<tulaticn which was disposed to make
tests of the market on any sign of easier
money and the course of the money mar
ket during the week has been toward
mitigation of the tension in force through
a!', the Rrcat money centers. Bonds were
