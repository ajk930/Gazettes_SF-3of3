one shot > from Bo*b Steele's rifle ..was
enough. The bullet grazed Jackson's
ribs under the right arm and brpke
his horse's neck. The animal col
lapsed in mid-air. He had intended
to kill, but instantly was 'secretly glad
of : the lucky accident. ' *
"Boyi. none of that. It won't wo*k

plenty of you 'fellows to keep" us com

believe his tale, but we'll see when we
get to Kiowa." -
The voice, though hoarse and raw,
-was.- cold and firm as iron. The Win
chester Was at: his shoulder, cocked.
The Sheriff-elect spoke along the bar
rel. He in black, the tile, and feathers,
painfully arose to his -feet. Calmly
and fearlessly "he faced his would-be
lynclyersl No anger, showed. Oh- the
. faci â¢ was a bewildered, pleading -ex

Paddy.'. Maloriey . as chairman. As they
were the most influential men in
iKiowa, ho objections were made.
;; The widow testified. Her 'story had.
grown and "changed, bit by. bit each
, time- she had repeated it during" the
Jast forty-eight hours. What early in
' the tale were opinions later on became
facts;- .surmises changed *to realities,
"and It was a. very, black story that she
: vehemently, related to the solemn jury.

Kiowa saw him "steal the roan. The

Then the reverend young minister
was called upon for his defense. He
really had none, could not remember,
had. a. confused remembrance .'of a
struggle, it was . all so mixed, he " was
so astounded, so unable to account for
it allâ some terrible mistake,, surely,
his -intentions had been the best. A
' groan from the crowd interrupted
him. - The minister sat down hopeless.
His thin, delicate, hands", still stained
with chicken blood, were * straining
1 with -each other between his-trem-*
'bling^'knees. A pure. ' girlish * face
arose, - mutely reproachful, before . his
eyes. ~ Would she .believe it? 'How
"could' she doubt it ? . He .himself be
lieved.it all, hideous as it.was. .It was
terrible, 'inexplicable, though in hid
heart he had. been' innocent of any
wrong .intent. Tears .came into the
man's, eyes. Then " the mouth moved
in 'silent prayer, the" lips tightened,*

Friday night 7 and tne^Freeman : ball
around the sunâ has long appeared- j
Ao me to be untenable, unless'there <
were a * constant application '\u25a0\u25a0'. of the â¢
original Impelling force, and none,
euch has been shown. Perhaps .the .
simplest Illustration :of â¢ the opera
tion of the supposed forces is that,
of a ball swungby the hana a-tne .
eri*d of a rubber string. --When* so %
Swung. the ball . will ; mamtain
its crblt. \u25a0- so to , speak. â¢ .around
the hand 'so 'long "as :.'\u25a0 the . hand
continues to supply a propelling force,
and no longer; "for so < soon as- that force
.is withdrawn the pull 'of -the rubber
string-the â¢ equivalent in such case jr
gravityâ will at once bring the ball to the
hand.' or to a point at which the con
tracting force 'of the rubber ceasÂ«s to
operate. What : is true In a small -way
must; be equally true In. a large.* where
the same forces are in operation.
Roughly! stated, the idea entertained
â¢ has been that the planetary bodies were
" given an initial velocity in a direct line.
- and that then the ' force of gravity so
'"operated as to change the" direction of
" that * motion" into an ellipse around the
fturi; the pianets swinging from the sun
at the end of the gravity string, so to
speak ; and that ' such ; motion continued
because it 'was assumed that the plan
â¢ ets were moving in a vacuum jind there
fore there was no friction to Impede, their
movement. But the apparent, fallacy of
that* is thaÂ£ the pull of "gravity is -a con
starit factor and that its pull is not weak
ened because it operates through a. sup
posed vacuum;' for; it must be apparent
â¢ that the 'ball swinging at the end Qf the
rubber string-the equivalent of gravity
would when the Impelling ; force, was
withdraWn. inevitably come to the hand
whether it -were" being swung- in a
' vacuum or not. It. may be conceded, that
"friction. 'caused; by: itspassage through
the air, would bring tlie'ball. or a. planet,
â¢more quickly to the center thamlf there
were no sucV friction. But time, as such^
is anegUgible quantity in this Cpnnec
"' From this, brief statement it is plain
that either that long current theory is
erroneous or that .there Is a constant
- application of â¢ accelerating- torce;. for the
Janets do keep their position. Or-and
this is the point to which we are-hedd
\u25a0' Ingâ that the force of gravity, as.here-
tofore understeod in this . connection, is
but one-half of electro-magnetic action,
or force. ' , â¢ .^; .
.With magnets, like poles repel, and un
like attractâ that Is. 4 positive magnetic
body repels another body that is. as to it,
positive; and attracts another body that
is, as. to it, negative. :
It is. also true that a non-magnetic body
may be . made temporarily . magnetic by
electricity, and that its magnetic condi
tion,'-when it is so made magnetic, ceases
when the electric currenfis sufficiently
-weakened or withdrawn.
It is also true that neutral or"non

came, at last. Betty stood before^her
mirror loking at her reflection. The 1
white mull gown, a gift from her aunt,
who -rarely gave her .niece anything
worthy .mentioning, was very becoming:
to the girl. She had arranged her. hair
after -the { style . of Mr. Elfland's -famous
picture, and she smiled as she looked*
at the 'change it made in her appearance.
"If I weren't" quite "so pink* and
round I might . look something like.
her, but she "was pale and sad. Some
how I am not sad. I don't know why, (
but I feel happy, wonderfully happy."
Turning. awqy from the mirror,, she
\u25a0was Jusf abput to wrap herself in her
cloak, when' her sister entered the
room," carrying ' two . narrow, ~ "vhlte
boxes. Betty dropped her cloak, took
the boxes and. opening one "of them,
lifted out a deej>, rich red rose,' fresh'
and fragrant, -proudly, drooping' Its <
heavy -head.' "and filling the 'room 'with
its odor. ' Betty examined the box,
but there was no card. ' Laying the rose
.upon the table and turning. to the other
box,; she lifted! from Its depths a long- 1
stemmed, half -brown pink rose, dell
: bate ; and : yet wonderfully- nreet -Thlsj
- rose was also without : .& card. . , \
; v "Ho w ; strange," ' murmured the . girl,
."that they (should both ' have had the

";-For a moment Betty stood silent.
.The " two roses lay upon the table.'
Suddenly she heard .her . mother's voice
Â» calling to \u25a0 ; her that it was time "to
start." Wrapping her cloak about, her,
Betty, turned and .* ran 'lightly; down
the-stairs. A moment later the sound
of ; carriage .wheels, rumbled along the
. street.;.
But the .roses? There, was only one

"whole "room and \ its heart .glowed . like

For convenience we will assume the

anQ would* so. continue to- do until the.,
planet had approached so near that the
. Intensive . electric rays had **> far mag
netized the planet, that- It had. become to>
a degree aâmagnetic positive. \u25a0 At that j
point the sarno -force that' had before* sft
tracted or'drawn. would repel pr drive off. (
with the* result that the planet, influenced
â¢ by.its momentum and the repellent mag-*
"netic force of the sun. would pass the
-san and continues on beyond.until it had
gradually become again non-magnetic or
neutral, when ' it* would be ag'aia -'at-Â»

which it would again.pass, and proceed to.

It would seem to be necessary that tha

RICH AND WHICH HAD MARVELOUS
EFFECTS ON ANIMALS
THE filler. family,- which consisted of four per
sons and" a red dog, lived in a small house
near the ;Kinkobasky River, far from any
neighbors : and \u25a0 so. far from school that the walk
thither took nearly an hour. It was rare indeed
to see the inail carrier '.stop at the Miller houso,
and even rarer to see the." expressman deliver any
thing there. Bui Tabbits; deer arid quail we're fre
quent visitors to the edge of the woods that sur
rounded the lonely house;. Thus, as you may imag
ine, xrhen a "wagon drove up to the gate and a large,
square box was carried- to - the doorstep, Robbie and
Clara Miller were much ' astonished and quite ex

: At that mpment Franz. Wilder arrived." Franz
'.was 'a little bojrwho-.lived a mile away and who came
almost daily. to the house. He was a : h"pbchback,
and liked to' play with' ihe Miller- children- becauaa
'.they ne.ver laughed at his deformity.- He was im-.
-mensely"intef6sted in-the= etrcnge box, 'and- while.
examining the many 'bottles he-.sudderily exclaimed: .
- "Say;! '. Here is a .letter .'down at the bottom. .'lt's
addressed to Mr. Hirana Miller inGerma'n'leltters." \u25a0
â¢ '"Why, can you read German ?". asked Clara.
â¢\u25a0 "Of course," replied *\u25a0 F;ranz;" * "my -mother is
Dutch. Jt -Can" read it ana 1 "speak" it, 'too."'V .
.."Then" you may bpe;h this/letter and., read .it to
us, so that we' may know whatsit all means, for papa
certainly/ can't read German and he won't kno^ '
who sent* these nasty-looking. .bottles." â¢
â¢ So" Franz* opened tÃe .letter and read as fdUows:'.
"To my cousin Wllhelm. or his eons, ffÂ«he be not

"hapsâ may follow th 4 use of those which I- Have not \u25a0
â¢ fully tested. The. Giant Syrup,- for instance, has not â¢â¢
been used as yet, .nor has the FUuld of Youth been .
â¢ tried upon any human being. I have succeeded with
. the Perfecting Mixture and some of the others.-' â¢
. * :â¢ # * "GOTTLIEB GESUNDHEIT." "
â¢"So 'these are, magic fluids 1" exclaimed Franz,
taking up a. bottle. "See! "Here it -says,; ' Giant;:
Sjron.* I wonder what' it's for? _ Here's ike Ter-

â¢ fecting Mixture,' too. It looks like quicksilver; and
this is the 'Fluid' of Y6uth.'".
"Gee! That must' have been pop's grandfather's
brother," cried Robbie. "I remember 'him saying
that there was a wizard -in Germany who was re* â¢
lated-to him.
â¢ "X-o, it' was his grandfather,"; declared Clara.
While the -two/ were disputing the matter Franz
â¢was examining the bottles, and finally, when he had
removed them all frojn the bbx .and placed them on"
the stoop, he taid:
, "Well, there's a lot of them! " Here's something
to make, the hair grow, and here's stuff to euro '
warts. "This is to' remove paint and this to kill bugs.
This is called 'Laughing -Juice,' and this one 'Music
.Ointment.' I wondcr'what that means." /
"Let's- get the' Red Book and find out," suggested
. the girl. .- . ;.
But a thorough search failed to reveal any red
book whatever.-and so it was impossible to discover
the' exact method of applying/any of the contents
of the strange bottles. \ r et this did not deter these
"children from trying to test the liquids iri the bot
tles, and they at once began with the- one marked
"Fluid of Youth." After removing the cork and
smelling of the dark, mysterious fluid, it was decided
to test its power upon an ancient and sedate goat
named Nanny, which. roamed the fields nearby with
out an owner or a home: Sprinkling some cabbage
leaves with the "Fluid of Youth," Robbie/ offered
' them to- the goat, who eagerly devoured them. Noth
ing happened, and finally Clara said, with a sniff :/
"Huh! L guess the stuff is too old. Give her some
more." , .
Another feed of cabbage produced no apparent ef
fect upon tho animal,; and the disgusted children
turned' to another bottle. . ; â¢
"I-.like the looks of this silvery stuff,", announced
Franz, holding the bottle up in the sunlight. "I'd
\u25a0 like to be perfected, you Bet ! I believe I'll , try it
on myself." . -
"Oh,- Franz, .don't you dare ! It might do some
thing dreadful to you !" cried Clara, with a shudder.
' A Pooh, I'm riofafraid! It couldn't make, me any
â¢worse-looking," answered the hunch-backed lad.
"Maybe it might straighten me outâ who knows!"- â¢
Before they could stop him he had taken a big â¢
swallow of the stuff labeled "Perfecting Mixture."
"It doesn't taste bad," hei announced after a mo
ment; "but, goodness! how funny it makeV you feel.
* Seems as if" I was on fire all over." , V.
*. "I do hope i.t won't poison you," said Clara. "I,
don't want to be perfected/ if I have. to take such
stuff." .-.*â¢â¢ ' ..
' "Oh ! "look at Nanpy 1" shouted Robbie. â¢ "Some
thing's the matter with; her." /
- Sure enough, something had happened to the goat.
She was frisking about like a ;young; kid,; Jeapingv
" over' rocks and bushes arid bleating, merrily. /There/

"I think that he will be gla-1 when he sees Franz,"
declared Clara. \u25a0 \u0084 :
But Robbie was now thoroughly frightened as he
thought of the tremendous power, of these .liquids,
-and he feared his father's anger.; His first impulse
was to hide everything until he could get "courage
to*' tell his parents what had happened ; and this was
mode stronger when he saw the croat, now; changed
\u25a0into a frolicsome kid, prancing about near them.
Had the boy been older he would have reflected -that:
the endeavor, to conceal their act was far more dah ; ;
gcrous than confession ; but he was only 12 and his'
fears carried him away. The others," nearly as much
scared I as himself, promised never to divulge /the
secret until he was willing; but; how was Franz to
account for, the change of his appearance, for. he
\u25a0wouldn't tell a lie. It was -at last decided- that he
was to tell" his; mother, but : first make her promise
to keep the secret. Each of them took several bot
tles to conceal i!i safe hiding places, and, they car
ried'the box into the woods. V; : .
Robbie, his heart in his mouth at hearing his
. father's voice in the distance/ dashed, into "the wood
shed, where he put his bottles on a shelf ;, but Clara
: carried hers to her bedroom and .concealed ithern:
Franz darted into the shrubbery and hastened home.
It would take a whole book to relate all that hap
pened after i that. . â¢ ,>\
An hour after supper, while Robbie's mother was
.wiping the dishes, his father, sitting^smbking on the
stoop, said, with a sigh: v ; ' "
"The whole world's argitting old; my pesky,rheu
matiz is bothering me, to-night worse than ever."
"Why don't you try that liniment that Mrs. Walsh
gave you?" asked Mrs; Miller.
"Where is it?" demanded her husband.
"Out in the woodshed, on the shelf ."replied Mrs.
Miller. "I clean forgot to bring it in, and it's just
where she left it that day; ; I'll go; and get it."
"I'll get it," cried Robbie, in great alarm.
"I guess I can get it myself," said his father.
Robbie darted away,. but before he could secrete
his bottles his father was beside him, wondering
vastly at' his son's': sudden desire to 6ave him trou
ble: ;He took the bottle from Robbie's hands, and-,
without looking at it, 1 returned to the house, leaving
his 'son. almost paralyzed with fright. * ;
* "Is ..this the stuff ?" he asked of Mrs. Miller;
"I guess so," she replied; "there wasn't any,
other bottle 'there."
"It tastes mighty good," exclaimed Mr. Miller,
smacking his lips., . ,
| -Then Til try it myself," said his wife. ; "My neu
ralgy is none too'qiiiet, let me tell you.'': -
Poor Clara sat^ there. in^awed 'silence watching
them,7 afraidi to speak; for' ha^'J she? not promised
silence! -'Mrs. Miller^took a tasted and then a good,
big drink of the magic Fluid of Youth," for, that 'was
the bottle which her husband happened upon: Then
Clara rose arid .slipped^ out. to) inform her brother.
She was trembling with mingled fear and eagerness
when she whispered : ; -\u25a0 - " : . '
"Papa arid mamma both have drunk out of one of
those bottles." . -^ . :J ! y / .
."You don't say ./so ?" cried Robbie. "I : wonder

;: Theresas a long period of â¢Ue^ceV' during which
the I two "children sat -in the * dark I beside Ithe Iwobd*
shed avra;ting developments and straining their ears
to,hear;anyjsound from the house. Then, sudden
ly, al oud peal of laughter rang out in the night.
The laugh didn't sound a bit like either father's or
mother's, yet there was something familiar about it.
Robbie started arid said:
"It's workqd. I'll bet that's pop. He's a. boy
again." ; ..
. "Then mamma's a girl," breathed Clara. "I'll bet
she's littler than me, 'cause she took an awful big.
dose!"
They heard more laughter, and it seenied to be
coming -nearer.; Then both sprang up -tp -flee and
, hide, but stopped at sight of a boy and girl who
were approaching, hand in hand, along the path.
.: "It's them !" gasped Robbie, and Clara, in sileate,
clutched his arm. They wore clothes exactly like
those worn by the children's parents, and as the two
looked at theiri in the dim starlight they could plain
ly see a resemblance to. the old people they had left
'a few minutes before bewailing their age and ill
,nesses; but, oh, what a startling difference! Rarely
ihad Robbie^and Clara^seen their parents smile and
. more^ rarely heard them ' actually laugh, .but now
these ;.twx);-.who-*-were-certainly their -parents," were
grinning and chuckling {with glee arid almost danc
ing with joy as they came; seeking for their children
hidingan the^da'rk. : Robbie held his breath. His
father, stopped when he; saw them crouching there,
; arid then he shouted: i
"Whoop! hooroo! Children, do you know -who we
are?^/.":, .. \u25a0\u25a0 ',-:;.
â¢ Robbie took a quick measure of his fathers size
and, rejoicing to see that he was at least two inches
shorter than himself, he operied his mouth to reply,
"when i his^ mother interrupted.
."Hush; let me speak. > This is, after all, a seriou3
\u25a0 matter." Then to thojchildren she said: S.
'1 "Something hfi3 happened* to us ; I don't know
what,- but we have. been turned into children again.
T mean" we look like children; but, after all, we are
your parents." " "
.Robbie, gaining^ all his courage- in a twinkling,
grinned and said:
y /.'Huh! /Now don't you kids come round here tell
"ing ariy such tale as that. * My father and mother
are old folks'," mighty nigh 100 years old, I guessâ"
"I am only 4.G" cried his mother. Then she
laughed.
' "Why, you are youncrer than I am," added Clara,
taking her cue from Robbie. "I guess you are only
about 10 years old. You mustn't pretend that you
are my mamma, little girl; it's not right."
."But, bless my soul, I am your mamma," cried
Mrs. Miller, gasping. "Come right into the house,
and we will tell you all about it."
"Xot iriuch !" cried Robbie, pretending to. be*
alarmed. "You want to get us irito the house, and
then pop will be after us with a stick. You kids
can't play any game like that."
"We're ; no kids," interrupted Mr. Miller, grin
ning. _ "I'll show you in a minute who I am; you
come along into the house."
"I guess I am not afraid of a little shrimp like,
you," retorted Robbie, eyeing his father carefully. .
"You can't take any gad to me, you know."
j Mr. Miller * snorted, and \ then .turned pale. He
suddenly realized , that his sbn was; taller and strong
er than he. "See here," he added, after a pause.
; "I" arii your father, although you. are bigger than I,
arid so you must -mind, me. This li tile girl here is
your mother, and she must be obeyed." I
"AH right, but you mustn't get sassy !" replied his
Bon. "We big boys don't want any back talk from
littler kids.V
When they all were indoors arid the children had
a good look at their wonderfully' changed parents,
the alteration was found to be most amazing; yet
with, it /all any oriej who * had known them, would
easily have recognized Mr. arid Mrs. Miller without
much trouble, so the children admitted, at last that
they were convinced of .the truth of their parents'
statements. They had been changed into little, chil
dren, 1 certainly ; but / when Mr.; Miller lighted his
pipe all of them laughed, for, after all; while/they
' had I been made young again, ; all their habits and
their manner of talking and'acting were the. same
as before in many ways, lit was such a funny,mix
ture /of youth and age/that they were continually
I roaring at the queer things that ; happened.- . After
;a while Robbie told about all the/wonderful bottles,
arid then his father, demanded to" see themu \u25a0 /
"I hardly ; think" it's 'safe to 'let^^such a ! small boy
monkey with such things!" ; said Robbie, very
soberly. / / >v
'"'\u25a0 ''Consarn'.it 1" shouted Mr. Millar, dancing up and
; downi ."don't you talk, like that any more, or there
.wiH'beitrqublet Bring out your "old* bottles!"
/ ; Wherithe bottles had^ been produced; and Mr? Mil
ler,} read Ithe â¢ letter"* of tthel old; German wizard, -he
sat thinking- for a itime arid then; said:
; Â» < You>icted very foolishly, and it is lucky that you

/we might| all, have] b^enTchariged < into [strange ; ani-.

would be follyto attempt to do anything -with, theso
without the Red Book, for mistakes might be fakd.
Xow that we really know the secret of two of the
bottles, we can do what we will with theâ¢* but I
shall lock the others up in the chest until the book
is found." â¢
"I think we .ought to give the old horsa and the
two cows some of that stuff," suggested Mrs. ilil-^
ler, laughing. "They are certainly pretty old."
"That's a good idea, and 111 do it in the morn
ing."
''And give them some of the perfecting stuff, too,"
said Clara. \ "Theji-ain't any. too'fine, you kno^."
NBW that all of the magic Fluid of Youth kad
vanished, and there" was no longer hope of .having
fun with* that, Robbie said:
"Too bad it's gone! But we still have the other
stuff, and" perhaps we can get a lot of fun out of
that, perfecting all sorts of things."
"Yes, and we have a lot of other, things; but I
am thinking now of something more than having
fun.", replied his father. "XowVthat we are young
â¢again, and have probably, many long years ahead
of us, we must try to mend our affairs. I see % way
to make the farm pay splendidly, and to-morrow I
am going td start a hew sort of cattle-raising. The
circus comes Ho town in the early hours, and Fll
trade our perfected horse for a couple of old,
broken-down circus critters, then we will perfect
them* and keep a-tradjng, two for one, until -we have
a thousand head of horses." â¢
"That's a grand idea V cried Bobbie. "Let's get
to work at once."
They hastened .to the tumbledown barn and gave*
the old horse some oats sprinkled withÂ»tbe magic
fluid. . It was then very late, and all were sleepy
and glad enough 'to hurry to bed. ,
In the morning Robbie awoke to find that Clara
had placed Baby Silas beside him, and wa3 speaking
to. him, laughing the while.
"Mamma and papa were squabbling in bed about
getting up to make the* fire," said she. "Mamma
says she's too little. and,papa thimks he's too feeble",
so I guess you will have to do it."
"I never thought that would be the result of all
this!" groaned Robbie, as he slowly got up and
dressed.*
He went to the barn, and there stood a hjarse that
was so splendid as to startle him. He loudjy yelled
for hi 3 "father, who wa3 so amazed that he almost
fell over.
"Why, that horse is worth two or three thousand
dollars !" he shouted. "We must get together all tho
old, broken-down plugs in the neighborhood at
once !"
Immediately after breakfast the two boys, father
and son, hastened to -the headquarters of the circu3.
people, where in a very few minute 3 they had
traded the noble horse for seven ordinary steeds,
much tQ the delight of the circus men. Then home,
they rode quickly and fed the Perfecting Mixture
to the old horses. At noon Franz appeared on the
scene ready to assist, and he told them of his par
ents' delight; but said that it had taken him two
hours to make them believe his story.
"Don't tell how it happened,'* said Mr. MlHer.
"If you do,. we will have everybody who has any
complaint (and everybody has something the mat
ter with him, you know) after us to cure them and
make them perfect. So keep the secret."
"I shouldn't wonder if you could makp a miTKon
dollars doing that very thing," suggested Franz. "It
might be better than perfecting horses!"
"Doubtless," replied: Mr. Miller. 'TBut think ef ,
the envy and heartburnings that might result if
some were madÂ« as perfect as you axe, for instance,"
while others remained crippled and distorted. No;
horses won't make- people discontented, for we are
all used to seeing animate far more perfect "than
men and women. We must never let anybody know
about the Perfecting Mixture at all I"
In the afternoon they rode away with the seven t
transformed horses prancing and curvetting in all
the pride of their youth, and two^ hours later they'
were seen leading home forty-nine scragglyold
wrecks which, next f morning, were turned into
equine beauties of such magnificence that both fa
ther and son decided that they need no longer trade,
but could sell at high prices. So they took* their
stock to the great city, where the horses
such excitement that their pictures were printed in
the papers. In two weeks they had made an im- ,
mense fortune, and then they found that they had
used up every drop of the mixture!
"Well," said Mr. Miller, "we have four of the
finest" horses in. all the world for our own' use, and
all the money we want, so we can't complain.- The
money will last us all our lives, and now well go'
in. for enjoyment!"
And so they did. On their farm you may see tae"
moatV magnificent roller-coasters and merry-go
rounds, swings and* miniature railways, pleasure
boat 3 and ice cream soda fountains in all the* wide"
world, and to every child for miles around all these :
things are free. I do not suppose you will find any
where ;6uch a of hearty enjoyment, "and my.
only wish is" that you may happen to visit the neigh
borhoods some itime to see ; for yourselves* that lam
speaking nothing but the truth3|HÃ" : .

/that after that affair at Devil's Gate" I
took a trip back East. I had been ab
sent exactly, four years the day I show
ed up' .in my little home town. My
mother and elder" sister were at home
â¢ and' were iprop'erly grlad to see 'me;
\u25a0after "a.- little while -my "father and
'.brother joined v's ; then 'just as supper
was ready my youngest sister came in.
â¢ .."Well, we went into the dining-room,
â¢and. : i .tell you; boys,-, it seemed strangely
.good-ito.sit once again in my old place,
\u25a0 'amid, the familiar .home surroundings, but
"."the old pictures and furnishings were the
" Qnly'-jan'chariged objects. I noticed a
.subtle change in the whole family. Moth
er seemed to have adopted a different
.mode'-of speech and action;. father was
â¢ grave and silent; my brother, appeared
.aWk"ward # and constralned.whlle my.eldest
' sister;- Alice, withdrew, into a languid re
.'eerve that I found unapproachable; my
"other, sister, Annie, kept her eyes- upon
'.her niaje, answering my questions with
.decided., bashfulness. I -seemed, strangely
out oX place., and. - Joeing - very hungry,
â¢ turned . -my attention to the table.
â¢ *'As I. looked over the few- thinly cut
'slices .of bread, sliced beef and lonely cubes
â¢ of -cheese -I thought of one of old Peter's
.'scows',' with a juicy, white-collared por
': terhouse and* double handful of fried po
..tatoes in the .corner. . Being directly op
.Tjosit-e my brother, I. studied him intently.
'When last I saw him .he ..was a . ruddy
faced"" boy of- 17. Now "before me -sat a
thin*. . sunken-eyed young dude with the
" thin, .tiiembUng hands, I lack-luster- eyes,
and 'drooping jaw of his clan. Faultlessly
" dressed, hlgji-collared, he nibbled ... his
dairjty- slice in silence. . f .
' "Boys, what would I not give to get
that young man out here, strip off his
outfit, leave it out there In the desert to
scare'coyoles {o-death-. and let the poor
neck swell against a blue flannel shirt!
â¢Father" was absorbÂ«d in the stock' column
of "the evening paper, so I helped myself
to everything in sight in a vain hope of
'filling at least one corner. of my stomach.
"Now and then during the silent" meal' l
caught .Annie's eyes- fixed upon me, but
before" I could catch their expression
they were quickly withdrawn. .
"How long a visit do you propose to
make," asked father, as he finally laid
â¢asi*Te the exhausted paper. - -
"Now, I had intended. to stay. a week,
and I assure you It was with surprise
1 heard my voice answer:
"'l' will' be obliged to leave in the
morning- â¢ . - \u25a0 â¢ ; :
"All looke.d their . surprise. , ' Mother
teemed disposed to -speak, .but, .biting
â¢ her* lips, refrained. Father, "after giving
me a keen glance, arose, saying:
" 'Rather short stay;'- then passed' out,
paper in. hand. I. hope that /I'm. wrong,

to tear holes in the Huron branch right

better." \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0"â¢â¢\u25a0\u25a0
CHAPTER X.
Fearing the total disappearance of bis
fire, John dove for his shovel. Despite
the exercise of all his strength, he found
himself unable to get any fuel beyond the
center of the \u25a0 firebox. Following close
upoc , a hissing noise 'from the cab. he â¢
saw the gauge pester begin to fall back.
His only knowledge of combustion being
that coal made heat, he redoubled his
rfrantie efforts. Brady, noticing the weak
ening engine, kicked down his seat: then
/for a few minutes stood surveying the
animated coal elevator. . - â¢ \u25a0
"Whatis the matter with her? She is
back to HO,',' he "aid. in mock concern,
i "I'm sure it's too- much for me,">replied
the sweating, grimy individual addressed,
.as Iwlthl hia shovel ' covered - with loose
coal, he stood resting, on- his scoop han
dle.' ;.
"I've got coal enough lri for 500." .
"Let me : feel . her pulse,;." said Brady,
throwing back -the door. "Only a bad
case of indigestion,"' he added, after a
brief inspection. Catching the slash bars,
after a few minutes of vigorous punch
ing, he^ remarked,' as a cloud .of black
smoke poured from the stack: "There,
that helps her. The combustion sharks
would tell you I'm wrong.- but look at
that stack.", painting to. the black plung
ing / volcano. _ "She is burning , her . fire .
now, all air. holes covered.* Now. when it
first,, becomes gray,. distrlDUte - three
sebeps along -one slde^ Then,"., when that*
burns off, give hec the, same dose op the.
other. Alter you learn . to : burn coal you
then can practice, saving it. Don't get
excited and overfeed her. You will be all
right. A new. fireman, always, in 'the first
ten miles presages, his .own future failure
.-or success. . My experience 'tells me there
is a future for the fellow, who, when the
pointer begins \u25a0-\u25a0 to fall, overloads her â
. none for the one who . tries with gaping
mouth to hypnotize the gauge."
*. After - Brady had returned to the cab
John, by a close "watch of the pointer
and stack, began to achieve better, suc
cess. . " â¢ \u25a0\u25a0""â¢'
"Got a green \ fireman?" asked ', the
' brakeman. .*,
V vile. Is all right; not, used to soft coal."
. replied Brady briefly. - By the time they
had made a couple â¢of miles John was
Ehowing quite a creditable stack. Then
as - th"e â¢ speed increased a. trail of smoke
from -Coriin's- engine warned Brady to*
./. "shut off.".
As ,the ; pointer quivered against 110 a
"triumphant paean sang from, the 1 pop. _ \u25a0
"Good boy," cried "Brady. **A solid
-gauge, tipped over the hill and the. squirt
on^fullhand."
'â¢ John, as he. crowded the bra'keman.
ahead on ' the narrow seat, tried very
hard not to look elated.. A grind of the.
.brakes as Coflin's engine stopped di
rectly opposite a. water tank.
"Never, saw freight, air handled tjiat
; way," commented Brady.- .When Brady's
engine had been placed Coflin called him'
ahead..
"Well. . how do you like it?" Ke -asked
from the. edge ; of the gangway. â¢
"It's a cinch," replied Brady; "I've only ."
worked her. in eight ' inches with a.crack
ed throttle." ' â¢ :
Coflin's only answer was a grim -.smile
as he pointed to a cloud of smoke and
steam outlined against the mountain
side. ;V- }*-y
"You see ud there? We.ll. that is Hu
ron, and only twelve " miles away. The
top of your bar "will be out of your face
after we leave her*.- Have your hunky
load her."
"John," said Brady, "count thirty
scoops into your firebox; put the. blower
on and get her hot."
It was only a few minutes later wÂ».en,
with the pop roaring, Brady waved Cpf
lin ahead. .
Both engines had their, work cut out.
The extra car, although divided, was per^
ilously close to being the '"straw." -
The road ran up a narrow rift in the
mountain, only room for the curved .
twisting bed and a. little' dashing stream.
As Brady looked upon the -rush of tho
tumbling, dashing â¢ water he began to
realize the mam of the gradient. s '
They had not rot a mile from Arctic
. when; Coflin pointed to a broken, rusty
' mass of wreckage; train rods protruding
like petrified ropes from a conglomeration
ot twisted,'; shattered wheels and axles
piled upon a crushed, boiler
damming the water on "the . point of a
sharp curve. Holding up two fingers he
pointed upward. .Brady s, smiled fjrinriy.
Four times in the next three miles came
again the ghostly reminders of fated
"runaways." Coflin repeated his grinl
â¢pantomime,"' wl*.hi fingers â¢ ranging from
two to â¢ four. An hour had been fought
away when the exhausts began to come
faster. Looking" under the cinder shower
Brady saw the clustering cabins of a
typical mining camp. As they passed
along the narrow street men and women
nodded approvingly as the extra passed.
and when they. came to a stop a heavily
bearded old car workman said: '
"Boys, that is something like. Four
more families are sure of warm toes." ".
"Yes. and you can thank old man Bâ
' for it," said Coflin. * . â¢
VWell. it's hard to separate B- â and
his men; they are^all of a kind/Vre
â¢ sponded the miner. *' â¢ . '
The train put away and the conductor
busily engaged In sizing up the yard, the),
l two "- engine crews . gathered upon the '
platform of the little: station around their
- lunch baskets. John and Brady*- being
i .unprovided the others generously shared
l wlth;thcm.' â¢ \u25a0 â¢ Â».->\u25a0:
"Well," said Coflin. "what do you think
of our road, and; especially the "Black

"The road^iB"all. right." replied Brady. â¢
"There's''one consolation, It's only up hill

â¢any .others, as they hav>e the advantage
'â¢or being li^htc and cool and washable,
tesJdes being becoming.. The afternoon
â¢' gawn' may, be of several different styles.
â¢ v That shown in .{he large illustration, is
â¢- cxtir'mely effective. -It is made jn three
â¢ 'rie'cfs. the yoke, the coat and the skirt.
;â¢â¢ The coat* comÂ«?s *>clow the hips and is
." made in the'redir.gote style of inch-wide
â¢';Jrish- Jaee, with -insertion of I'alenciennes.
.'â¢lt As LtJted" in at the waist by a girdle
.-' passing through the buttonholes in front,
*. -eo^tliat .about 'four inches on each side
ha'ns dqwn straight. It meets the yoke
' at the shoulders and is cleverly finished'
.'"by a lour-inch flounce made of the Inser
tions, which .run around. The sleeves are
made to puff/at the top as far down as
â¢ the *!bow, and lo fit tight from there to
\u25a0 the wrist. The coat does not meet in
front., but* allows room for the vest,
.\u25a0which is atta^ied to the yoke. The yoke
and collar are made of lace insertion, but'
â¢ the vest, which is loose and fluffy, is
pade of the same material as the skirtâ
. a very fine batiste, which resembles silk
. mull. "TliWi vest ie made with graduated
tucks, edged with Valenciennes lace. The
tklrt *cf this elaborate costume 'is made
\u25a0 ..quite full, with three rows of fine ehir
,rinK at the belt. It has three groups of
\u25a0 three tucks- each, and the bottom of each
tuck Js edged* with Valenciennes lace,
\u25a0with a band of \"alenciennes insertion let
in between the tucks. This is a very
.etrlking costume, particularly appropriate
. for a tall woman with a graceful figure.
. The lingrerie hat. which Is to be worn
with it, is appropriate and attractive, as
It ra.rries out the "lacy" effect of the
â¢ dress. . * â¢
Lingerie hats are to bt had in two a
ttyles. the round baby shape and the
poke bonnet shape. Of these the baby
chape seems the most popular, as â¢it ia'
generally the most becoming. It is usu
ally-made of "soft linen ruffles edjed with
â¢ Valenciennes lace, end .rac an embroid
ered crown, with a large taffeta or soft
t;i tin bow.Jn front. The little Hash of
color given by the bow is very charming.
There would be but little difficulty in
making the lingerie hats at home, by get
ting a frame and covering It with the
lace, particularly If one has a hat to
copy. I saw many of these Mats In
France last cummer, and although trtfey
were really quite elaborate they ap
peared very simple and suggested the
Idea of elaborate simplicity, an art whjch/
is rarely acquired In this country. . r
Another very pretty afternoon gown is^
Ehown in one of the illustrations, made i
of all-over embroidery. " The skirt needs
no trimming, as the embroidery is In
Jtself sufficient foFthat purpose, but It Is
made with a deep flounce, headed by a
lace ruche.
The bottom of the flounce 1s scalloped
end edged with Valenciennes lace. The
under Crop skirt is of ' Persian lawn with
a deep accordion plaited, flounce. .The
w.iist is made with a vest of * double
thread Valenciennes "lace. â¢ Two straight
ruffles, abcruf four inches " wide, are

Children's dresses and dresses ior young
girls, frsm 9 to 14 years of ase are now
made very daintily and with a great deal
of style. I have recently seen some
" Imported dresses of this kind tnat are
worth describing. The material was of
the be3t and finest, and the hand work
on them was beautiful. The soft and
fluffy French dresses for children seem
to. me much prettier than our American,
styles, -which are plain aRd often stiff.
It would be 'difficult to 'make a compart
eon between ouf "Russian blouse" ajid'
the dainty figured dimity dresses to which.
I refer. These dresses were made beau
tifully, tlTe waist being made with a llttlo
straight vest, which was hand-tucked and
that had two Van Dyke points of Valen-"
ciennes insertion, below which were three
bars of the same lace. The deep collar
â¢rever xvas hand"-tucked and had a pattern
of embroidered lawn set In. .On this waa
sewed a knife plaited ruffle ol dimity.
The. sleovee were made, albow length,
and ;were of course .puffed at thÂ© top.
and 'were held la at the elbow with c.
wide "band of embroidery, to which was
attached a full, though not deep, flounce
edged-with lace. The skirt waa mado
quite full, givinz the effect of having. a
couple of flounces, which, was accom
plfshetl by a knif<Â», plaited two-inch nifSt*
that "was Sewed op about six* Inches from <
the bottom of. the skirt. The skirt
.reached a little below the knees, and on
the bottom of it was another knife
plaited ruffla" like the first one. ( Ther*
were five rows of lace insertion' on *tho
pklrt. .A very broad crush satin ribbon,
which matched the little flower In the.
dimity, served for the belt, which was
to bÂ« knotted Jauntily on one side, leav
ing ends that reached almost to the floor.

Would Keep nil 'â¢Tnlnted'Money*?. Where
.' It Belongs.
As to this "tainted money" business,
I want to chip- in with old John D.
long enough. to say that I think some
of these geysers who are spouting
against "it are jusfmaklng a grand
stand Splay. The;\ money Rockefeller
puts up will buy. Just as many meal
tickets for the- missionaries as if it
had been handed out by some fellow
who had never smclled kerosene. Never
heard .of 'anybody. refusing to take my
money, did you? I've; let go of a pile
of it and a lot of It went;to churches
and charities, but I can't remember that
anybody sent any of it back because
I'd made- it selling my kind : of knock
out drops to put fellows to sleep. ~
Take Rockefeller's stuff, ;ali you can
get of it, for' the same reason Ben-But
ler. used | to" \ advise the'; Democrats in
Massachusetts" (when he happened to be
a. Democrat) to : take "Republican
moneyâ to -spoil' the Egyptians. I
wouldn't /swap places with old Rock.,
butlthat' wouldn't stop me from taking
his coin,, because what he has belongs
to the rest of us' as much'as it does to
him. .'He has to live on^crackers and
milk, and I'll bet he'd give all his "pile
if- he could eat, and enjoy the 'dinner I
had to-day of corned beef and tabbage.
His money i 8 not of much use to him
and we'd be doing him and ourselves a
good turn by taking it. '
! The money-ought to be kept right iri
this country, though. Jt y belongs here
and the heathens are not perishing for
red flannel shirts. , You don't find John
D.'s sparring partner, Rogers, who used
to push a handcart around the streets
of New Bedford, throwing his coin to
the healhen. He's keeping it in the
United States, where some day it will
come in Itandy, when he has let go of it.
The job don<? by .Owen Moran. ii.c Brit
ish bantam, on Moiite Attell in New-
York, makes him -fit to meet Frankie
Neil, our champion/ in \u25a0.this, class. Attel
is entitled to another try. with the Brit
isher, for he certainly made! a game bat
tle of it for the last ten rounds; of' the
twenty, and was on his feet at the' finish.
My opinion is that while the" British
are^improving because. they are learning
our style,, any American can beat any
Englishman of equal weight. Moran de
served the decision over, Attell, but the
work Monte did should result in his" keep
ing the confidence of his friends. Perhaps,
after , Moran has tackled ' Frankie Nell,
the Britisher will have lost some of his
steam, and Attell will be more in line
for the work cut out for him; Tom
O'Roiirke thinks so well; of Moran that
he proposes' to back him;,.when he faces \u25a0
Neil,' but Tom doesn't .guess right , all. the
time. -.'.*%" â¢ r. â¢
..'From what I can learn about- Moran,
the* twenty rounds-he will- havevto go
against Nell is too far a, distance . for
him, and his punching ability will be
pretty, well used under the treatment, the
American, champion will provide. It will
be a nice trial, -however, and I am going
to make the. effort to see it.. Moran did
not have the goods to put Attell out.
and he will need more than he has shown
up to date to take any honors from Nell,

JOHN R. SUTTMAN
who. has confidence, push and know-how
â¢to burn.' .- . â¢ . . \u25a0 " ,
The first big fight I hadâ big in a money
wa><-was with John Flood of New York.
r ~This fight always reminds me of the say-
Ing that 'ln every man's life there Is a
tide, which," -if taken at its flood, leads
on to fortune.' My\ taking on of Flood
did lead , to several fortunes, which have
gone the, way of the year-before-last
birds' : nests." Flood was known as the
'^Bull's Head Terror.", He looked like a
sure winner, on paper, "and on top of that
.the gamblers had it fixed so that .he
would win anyway. They forgot to fig
ure where I was to come in."
We fought on a barge in the Hudson
River near Yonkers, N. V.Â» on. May 16.
\u25a01881; ' Good old Al. Smith was the_
referee, and with him to say what's"
what I felt that I would get/a fair
show, no matter what ugly yarns â¢were
going:. The purse was $1000. winner to
get $750. At, that. time, although I had
made good in some pretty stiff argu
ments, the New York sports thought
I was only a. high-grade : hot-air mer
chant, and that' they couldn't K>se their
coin' on Flood; I had very few friends
in the tough: crowd aboard the barge,
as nearly all were New Yorkers, and all
they could do to fix the fight for Flood
had been done.
â¢I fought \u25a0 so fast that the jobbers'
scheme didn't have time to cook up.
The r battle lasted " eight rounds, sixteen
minutes, and the "Bull's Head Terror"
was \u25a0; asleep. His [ seconds threw up a
towel to, show that their man was all
in. Flood, early in the battle, realized
that he had no show, but he fought as
well as he could and was game for the
bitter medicine I handed him. . .
After the, fight. I shook hands with
him, told him he had made a good try,
and then I took up a subscription for
him: My friend? were. more than w.ill
ing to contribute because they had won
'plenty of money, and Flood's friends,
who had lost, couldn't very -well refuse
to give up to their own man.
Fight With a Miner. With .Cowhide
. . , Boots â¢ On.
Out .in Butte," Montana, in the old
t day's when I was offering JlO.OO to any
body.'who would' stand in. front of me
four, rounds, a .big j miner, with red
'whiskers tried for the prize. He carno
at me after I'd put in the day seeing
the town in the pld way, and I wasn't
in the- best, of condition. Some of my
party .were scared blue, because they
and the miner thought it' looked easy
for him to get the money. *
*, "He's as big as a house and got a
reach like a triphammer," said one of
my party, just before I went on, speak
ing of the miner. ' *\u25a0
"Pretty big, is he? "Well, the harder
he'll flop when he goes down for Jhe
count," said I. .':â¢ - r ;;
"When I saw the miner in fighting
costume, he was a sight.. I don't re
member what he' wore except his red
whiskers and cowhide boots. Yes, he
wore cowhide. boots into the ring and
they.looked as bunchy as the two and
a half ounce gloves he wore.
\u25a0 I seemed so easy to- the miner that he

his 'boots to do the job he'd laid out to
do on me. He came at me fast and the
first; thing I knew he had -landed one on.
the side of^ the jaw that was stiff enough
to pull me together. If. there had. been >
any. bad effects from my seeing-the-town"
tour, that wallop shook them out of me."
and I went at him. There was only one
round and the miner was on the floor.

You can make work play or
play work according to your tem
perament. You can sweep yourself
Into an invalid by. doing it wrong and
you can end a half-month's house
cleaning with rosy cheeks and a light
heart vif you have the right training
and the spirit of happiness in you.
Most forms of housework are just
good physical culture gone wrong. If
you can get away from the tradition
that women are worn out with house-
hold duties, if you'll stop to remem
ber v/hat physical exercise is for and
how you get good results from it you
will see at once that sweeping and
dusting and bed making and even sew
ing are just equivalents for arm
stretching in lung work, for bending
to limber the waist, for sitting erect
to straighten the spine and for lift
ing weights to develop the throat..
In other words, if you know how to
I do housework you can get your physi
cal culture with your housework, and
you can, get in fine trim for the whole
summer doing much dreaded house
cleaning.
First of all practice breathing and
v/alking correctly. It's just half
breathing and walking in a heap that
wear 3 "out most women. It Is v not
action. ..--
Stared straight, chest high (always
high), shoulders low, spine erect,
abdomen drawn back: stand this way,
walk this way and work this way.
Then breathe slowly, filling the lungs
with air, expel it slowly and never let
your chest 'sag. "A chest out of plumb
means - weak . lungs, round shoulders,
anemic bust and poor circulation, and
equally important, a figure wholly de
void of style. . . "
Next dress sensibly.... This doesn't
mean to ! put on a fresh shirt waist and
stiff linen : collar and snowy apron and

EVIDENCE OF SURGERY SUPPLIED
BY PREHISTORIC SKULLS.
As the result of his. researches, Dr. L. Manouvrier of France declares that delicate surgical
operations were performed with crude instruments four thousand years ago. He supports
his belief- by exhibiting ancient skulls which show: clear evidences of trepanning;
Delicate Operations Were Performed by the Medical Ancients in France
Special Cable to The Call.
PARIS, July I.â lf there was* one de
partment of human activity to which no
cne had eve> dreamed of â¢ applying the
trite, adage that "there's nothing new
under the sun/* 'it .was surely modern
surgery. Delicate . operations on bone
end organ werÂ« he,ld â¬ .up as brilliant ex
amples of perfect progress, and the awed
world wondered. But to-day, the revela
tion has come, that- this, too, is old and
.that surgery existed before history be
gan.'
This remarkable. discovery is due to the
researches t)f Dr. L. Manouvrier, the
most famous anthropologist in France,
who having observed* and studied unmis
takable marks on prehistoric skulls found
in the region of JParisj now boldly de
clares that the* great twentieth century
eurgeon 1b merely treading In the wake
of " skilled .practitioners who, without
anaesthetics or antiseptics, with blades
of* flint instead *of .tempered steel, per
formed three or foii'r thousand years ago
operations requiring thorough knowledge
and consummate ability. >
"It Is established beyond question,"
raid. Dr. Manouvrter, "that trepanning,
even to-day a delicate operation, was not
only known in prehistoric times but was
practiced far more extensively than now
adays. Before trepanning, surgeons
must have known of other* operations,
the traces of which have disappeared,
like the wooden tools and arms which
preceded stone. Amputations and-bone
setting required less imagination and
cestainly no . more skill than certain
openings in skulls' whose perfection is
Eimply amazing. Men .able to do such
work could not .be disconcerted by
email operations. As for 'dressing
wounds, they must tfave understood the
art perfectly, for trepanning requires
very complicated dressings."
PROOF THAT PATIENTS LIVED.
"And," was suggested, "these mar
velous prehistoric operations were fol
lowed with the usual gratifying results
pt rcotfern gurgical achievements, signal
triurnrfhs from the- professional point
of view, but the* patient unfortunately
i'.y!nÂ£ from complications?"
"No. for we have proofs that the pa
licnts survived." '
From the skulls filling :the glass
â¢;ihcs which lay about him. Dr. Man
uvricr" selected one. %
"liiis skull, which is a particularly
i rautiful one ** he i>egan. :
"You said?"
"Beautiful," he repeated. "Don't you
ihink so?.- Weir, not only was the
operation of- trepanning 1 successfully
â¢\u25a0< rformed,~bul the patient lived, long
enough afterward . for the bones to : knit
together and cicatrise, that is, several
ytaj's at least. Qn this other skull the
evidences are the same."
There certainly were queer marks on
the skulls, and even deformations.' It
Wits probably all right,,but one doubted.
"Are you sure these are operations?"
was' Ventured. "In the days of' battle
axes and battering: rams, when melted :
lead was sprinkled on* bestegers, when
gallant lords frequently tossed; dag^'j
gers at the heads of ; their r> spouses,'
when between drinks the masters threw
drinking horns at their vassals, as; a
gentle hint that it was time for,< more
*\u25a0*\u25a0"*" 't would seem extraordinary.' \t ;
The San Francisco Call.
FRENCH SCIENTIST WHO DECLARES -THAT HE HAS FOUND PROOF â¢ THAT
PEOPLE FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO WERE SKILLED 'â¢ IN SURGERY
His museum and a skull which bears out his theory.. â
skulls had not been somewhat the worse
for wear and tear." \u0084 .'-r.^l 1 ; _
"For pity's sake," exclaimed the
learned doctor, "don't bring in . me
dieval anecdotes when I am talking of
the yÂ«ar 3000 B. C. or thereabout. But
granting that people behaved as badly
1n the last-mentioned year as they did
later,' or as they sometimes do to-day,
the evidence of brutality left upon
skulls Is very, different from this. Wef
have skulls \u25a0 broken * by swords "or

dent; the break is jagged and ..irregu
lar, even where if has healed. But the
hypothesis of accident" is impossible
with the skull I "hold. Every indica
tion of the most "minute care subsists
to enlighten us as to the way In which
the opening was made. You may be
sure that I exhausted all other theories
before stating that' this was a 'case of
prehistoric trepanning. â¢
TREPANNED TOO MUCH.
"The opening, as you may ;~ see, was
about oval, and was made , by. scraping
a beveled furrow round the line traced
for -the operation. -: The operation -of
wearing away the bone lasted at least
one hour and perhaps two,'; and must
have been frightful. It was : accom
panied by external and . internal . hem
orrhages and the definite destruction
of important vessels. '
"First, .a ribbon of, flesh more than
three inches in length had to be 'cut
in the scalp. Then In order to 'lay - bare
"the bone more "than half of the tem
poral muscle had to be sacrificed .and
the . temporal artery , had to ', be - severed.*
Then the skull < Itself was attacked by
scraping until a section- could bei*re
moved,:' to be - replaced ; afterward ; ': so
skillfully that It knitted with the sur
rounding edges and the ; patient 'lived."
"And" without anaesthetics?"
"Antiseptics,*' interposed Dr. Manouv
rier, "are necessitated by ,; the overcrowd
ing of our modern cities. There* are* to-:
day in Central France reg:qns where cer
tain operations: can . be' successfully.*.' perf;
formed without antiseptics.;. 'sometimes
without common cleanliness, . whereas Jin
Paris the same operations are; generally,
fatal,", though all ." antiseptic.-.' precautions 1
are taken. The reason is : that . whereTthe
air is; pure 'and the life healthy,": there "are"
j few microbes, whereas these swarmwher
ever; humanity , gathers together in a
smali space." |QfKWWjjM^lBÃWi^(*fi^Â§
I "But why; should such a ' .horribly
painful operation ",be ; attempted?"
, "We . have :no way "of knowing that.
Perhaps the " reason was ' a .wound *\u25a0 in \ the
portion : of the skull| which \u25a0 the trepanner
rtmaved,';and *â¢ which might . have i caused :

! ning- is resorted; : to. wherix a; splinter. :;of
bone weighs 'on the \ brain. . Sfnce r they,
knew the_ operation -in prehistoric: times,"
they may. have known ; (he Treasons : also.'
Nevertheless. ~we are led to. believe that
SAN- ;FRANGISGO, y SUNDA^- JULY; 2^ 1905,
they trepanned too much. To-day there
Is perhaps one case iof trepanning; for 'a
million men. Among ; skulls '" of the neo
lithic ' period, found in 'the : Paris J region,
one skull from every twenty-five, at "a
rough calculation," is \u25a0in some way oper r
ated on." .
OPKRATIOXS FOR ALL Iljl ' S '
"Then there were different- forms of
operations?" â¢ V
"Certainly," answered Dr. Manouvrier
opening" another case in his j laboratory
and taking. out \ a skull . marked with a
curious Ton the summit. . ,
"There was a simpler operation which
was far more frequent and vWhich was
the first to attract my i attention. These j
marks were certainly made "on the living
subject by the hand of , man.'.- On account
of their form and their position I ;named
them 'the sincipital ; T,' and I sought i
several hypotheses to explain - them. 'It I
appeared possible that these marks might
have been caused by a, peculiar .', and
weighty form of headdress, or " ''-' else
branding, to mark prisoners, or as;sigh
of mourning, or religion. The only theory
which resisted analysis was that of medi
cal treatment, \ and careful examination
of different skulls bearing similar! marks
with" variations sufficed to ' convince 9me
that they were caused by incisions or
cauterizations performed upon children
or â¢ adults as curative or preventive
measures.
"Quite br accident, I at this period
found several texts left by "classical
surgeons of the -middle ages, who
recommended that' in t eases of conviil-:
slons, mania, .epilepsy. \cephalaigia,, etc.,
incisions and cauterizations should be
made on the head, i.e., the very opera-
tionto which.l had,. on the strength of
my observations, attributed the sincipi
tal marks. I was thus able to estab
lish the link between prehistoric and
modern surgery. ' -Z'^'-'fP^-'- "'.'\u25a0- \u25a0 'â¢ â¢

Without shame I confess .to having
once more fallen a victim to the Artful
Advertiser. One finds oneself in so good
company here! Who has not been se
duced into reading half a* column or so
.<:oticerrJng sunspots, to flnd himself fin
ally insulted as- a pink person- in need of
"pale pills? In such fashion I was in
veigled by tne following, purporting to be
a protest against my approval of the
child singer, Bessie Frencn. at the Orpb
cum this week. . It turns out to be an <
advertisement of soap!
But as this extraordinary little girl
and the significance of her singing iÂ« the
musical topic of the week, I print the
letterâ barring the advertisementâ as a
text:
â¢â¢Raiding, nurseries may not hurt the
'conscience of* the vaudeville trust, but
ibe dramatic critic who will condone a
theft from the cradle is a party to the
crime. To the music-hall trust, with its
calloused conscience; business is busi-
g riei.s. The people arid their alleged voice,
t&e critic* should join issue In the dec
laration tnat all kidnaping looks alike,
"ana by withholding patronage and ap
proval convince t,be trust ; that child
stealing is not .business in America. The
cleverer. !the 'Infant Patti.' the greater
ths crime. . A^nd when tfie millstone la
around the neck of the music-hall mag
nate who 6tole the child and in coining
.the charms of torday stunted the woman
hood of' to-morrow, and of the critic, who
used soap instead of vitriol, may there
Â£>c; 'present in faft sight of both a pre
maturely aged 'Infant Patti' to sing In a
woraont voice:- 'Whoso shall offend one
of, these little ones It were better for him
(or her) that/ etc
â¢' 'Even so It Is not the will of your
Father whicn is In heaven that one of
these Uti^e ones .should perish.' "
' HktÂ» Is the article in Question:
'â¢"If the baby Patti "at the Orpheum this
week goes the way she should go, you
"wi.U be hearing - things qf Miss Bessie
French six .or. seven : years hence. Bessie
Is announced as. the child prima donna'
and sings, up to the name. She is nine
years old and looks seven. She sings lit
tle things like the 'Lieti Slgnor* and
D'Hardelot's "Mlgnon,' and her reper
toire Includes -as. many airs as most pho
nographs'. Usually there is nothing more
victoriously unpleasant than the child
.singer of vaudeyille-r-except it be the
jrrown siriger. The tune the old cow died
of ir seductive to the howls of the infant
basso. You bless Gerry and all his works.
You would Import him if you could. And.
" hearing these little ones, you feel
ashamed of yourself. You feel yourself
accomplice in the murder of the loveliest
sound on God'.s earthâ the white, winged
sweet of children's voices.
"You do not- feel that way about little
â¢Bessie French. Bessie sings by the grace
of -God to begin with, with substantial
.help from . a Chicago teacher named
Stevenson. Mr. Stevenson deserves to be
iiamed. Bessie has been- taught to use a
pbetiomenal voice -in a phenomenal " way.
She eings in absolutely unforced fashion;
â¢the voice Is perfectly placed; her pitch is
..true to a hair. and she phrases like a vet
,-eran. -Add to this the remarkable range
'and' volume of the voice, the little sing
ers exquisite feelingâ mature in taste,
yet childlike in sentiment, and a tech
nique* of astonishing sort, and you get a
' child Vocalist of a kind that you are un
iikely to hear "soon again. The little girl
.=ar.Â£ .last night the 'Mlgnon* song of
D'Hardelot. the 'Lieti Signor* of Mey
erbeer "and "Mighty Lak a Rose* that
S'ordjfca brought here. She seems to en
joy the singing as much as you enjoy the
Uscening and is a conspicuously pretty
. figure' a la Watteau in her curls and bows
and little j?lnk gown."
â¢ And row, my. dear correspondent, I
do not object to your filching my thun
der, but you cannot expect me to take
6.cr'louTEly"your assertion that It is yours.
Pjjt on your glasses and read again:
"if the -baby Patti at the Orpheum this
week goes on the way she should go,"
.ftc. ""Usually there Is nothing more
victoriously unpleasant than the child
â¢Flriger of vaudeville. You bless Gerry
(G^rry is the person who protects the
child wonde* from parental greed
and' ."vaudeville trusts") and all his
works. You would Import him if you
ccmld. And, hearing these little ones,
you feel ashamed of yourself. You
feel accomplice in the murder
of the loveliest sound on God's earthâ
the "white, winged sweet of children's

enal voice in a phenomenal way. She
sings in absolutely unforced fash
ion. â¢ â¢ â¢â¢Childlike in sentiment.
â¢ â¢ â¢ She seems to enjoy singing as
mach as you enjoy listening." \u25a0\u25a0-: '
It is to explain, my dear correspond-;
ent, that Russian wars - and things
take up space, or I should have said
more. I should have said that I" had
noted the plump, firm legs. with \u25a0which
little Miss French walkert /on ; the
Orpheum stage. I should nave said that
I hsd noted a chest and throat bullded
for singing and a lung power and
breathing- habit that almost ~of Itself
Insures perfect health. I should have
said that I had noted an absolute poise,
a total lack of nervousness in" the child
that indicates complete freedom from
nervous strain. Interesting also would
have been the fact that up to two years
ago, when the now sturdy little -girl
began to study singing, it was doubt-"
f ul if little Miss French would live
at all. .
What was said was. however, suffi
cient for the average intelligenceâ that
the child is a. phenomenon, an excep
tion, an "infant Patti' : ; that her teach
ing has been phenomenal, exceptional;
that the care evidenced in her upbring
ing is phenomenal, exceptional; that,
therefore. Bessie French differs in
every fashion from the ordinary child
singer of vaudeville. Restated, from
the inherent evidence Bessie French is
not a victim of parental or other greed,
and her appearance in vaudeville Is not
a crime, while the appearance of most
children in vaudeville IS a crime and
themselves victims of parental or other
gTeed. Is that quite, clear, my corre
spondent? I haven't time to make it
clear to you if it is not.
Curious to know just what condi
tions have conduced to the remarkable
development of little Miss French, I
went to chat with the little girl the
other day. First, however, I listened
again to her "turn." Listening with me
was Miss Estelle Carpenter, who, as
custodian of the 50,000 child voices in
our public schools, I had invited to
hear this wonderful baby. Miss Car
ptnter began by exclaiming: "Oh,
that Is exactly what I am trying for
with my children! She is the child
singer perfect. She sings as easily as
a bird, and" â heavily Miss Carpenter
emphasized this ""and," "it is pure
chlld-slnglng." She ended by saying
that she was going home to advise her
60.000 pupils to hear Miss Bessie. . ;
As we listened we recalled the stories
of the tinr. Patti. trilling astonishment
into all hearers at nine years old; of
Sontag, who at six years old appeared
in opera and at eight sang "The Queen
of the Night" from "Zauberflote", in a.
fashion that has become historic: of
Madame Malibran and her solfeggi, at
six. her famous Rosina at 17; of Giulia
Grisl, already celebrated as a concert
singer at 16; of the. child triumphs of
Jenny LAnd; and wondered if we were
not hearing the first songs of a singer
destined to become; another such as
these. It seemed certain that we were,
as those astonishing trills and roulades
of the "Lrieti Signor" rippled out, easy,
as. the song of a thrush and toned. clear
as a bell. It seemed even more cer
tain behind scenes, where we discov
ered how excellently favorable is the
environment of tne little singer.
Pink lemonade Bessie chose to talk
over, and her ecstatic sips and ejacula
tions of "good!" were exactly, like any
other small girl's of nineâ except that
they were Interrupted by wonderful
little cadenzas, scraps of this, that and
the other big arias, echoes of Mr. Ros
ner's orchestra, bits of Lillian Shaw's
dialect songs. Miss Bessie Bhowediher
self, too, auite . as . conscious -of Â° her
pretty pink frock as the next "little
girl â perhaps more ... careful of It, : as
Bessie's papa is not a Morgan, in fact
Mr. French is of that extremely useful
but not wealthy class, the
person. Closer regard, again, ? showed
little Bessie possessed of a chest and
shoulders that any mother would thank
God for in her child, ', and Incidentally
Miss Bessie's cheeks are. of the pinkest,
her bluo eyes of ' the clearest and; her.
fair hair of the sunniest.* .
It was Mrs. Frenchâ who in. asking
Bessie to sing this and, that,, illustrat
ing, showed that Bessie came naturally
enough, by her voiceâ who told us the
little girl's artistic and other history.
Bessie is almost 10 years old. .She was
born singing. She sung almost before
she talked. But when the little girl
was eighteen months old she had

every other "ill that ; the child -flesh- is
heir to. But between .times Bessie still
sang., She sang at the usual child-en
tertainments. On Friday;, afternoons
she was 'lent from; school to school 'to
sing for the other children. She sang
occasionally with professional enter
tainers. - ~ .-' ..â¢'..... .â¢ :.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.:'- ' '-''-'\u25a0
It was on one of these occasions v that
the young woman .who recommended j her
mother to take Bessie to | Mr. I Stevenson
(who has been her only teacher) t heard
the little singer. .- But . Mrs. : French ; was
poorâ as singing expenses go. .Stevenson
is a highly priced teacher.* She hesitated.
The young woman asked if it was the
money? ""Noâ"o â oâ " Mrs.' French: said: But
at length she took the child, and - from
what she said, I think there is here an
other , instance of the kindly and noble
artist, who ssrves his; art most finely
by helping the gifted and ; poor student>
Two lines of a song Mr. Stevenson heard
Bessie sing and simply said: '"Come to
me." \u25a0 -.'\u25a0..'''\u25a0':..'â¢'\u25a0' \u25a0'- \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0â
Three lessons a week, of three-fourths
of an hour each, Bessie has had - since
then^ two years ago. â¢ At tne
of them her . life was feared . for; [ she ; is
now absolutely healthy. | Mr. Stevenson's
teaching must be judged | by . its '.'.results-^,
of the art side. "l speak now. Nominally
I do not agree with the method;, actually,
the reEUlts "compel belief. Bessie has been
taught purely by imitation. She has
learned to sing as a child learns to speak.
She knows nothing of the grammar of the
art. "A few. of them," she replied > when
I asked her , if she knew her notes.^ But
her articulation is perfect, her pitch ; and
tone absolutely pure, and her breathing
a delight. Again, j she sings in a con
vincing Italian; her | French is simply,
comical in its accuracy; yet Bessie knows
neither language.; She : sang ' "Ouvre .'â¢ tes
Yeux Bleus" (Massenet) \u25a0 for me,- and one
would* have sworn to a tiny French -nose
back of her accent.'- That Mr.- Stevenson
is 'an 'artist is proved by the fine phrasing
and nuance of j his little pupil's \u25a0 song;
these also, of course, being the result* of
imitation. "He sings a phrase and I sing
it," Bessie puts it. .That , Mr.^Stevensbn
is j also ; that rarer \u25a0 thing, ; . a wise 1 man; is
further true, 4 the child's emotional devel-*
opment being absolutely, normal,, her sen
timent- perfectly - childlike. 3 Some.' easy
solfeggi she practices/ In j addition to her
arias and songsâ an' appalling: list. Her,
memory, is extraordinary. In three les
sons Mrs. French told usâ and : Bessie
laughed, "I did!"â she learned the . big
waltz song from ; "Romeo and ;
What was -the compass of the voice we
asked then, and Miss .Carpenter, took ] out
her tuning fork to test it. A below mid
die C, ; the child sang, and then, : without
a break in quality, ; ran up ; to G\ in altls-*
simo ! j : In mischief then 'she flew, further,
up, up,.up;to C in altissimol ;. We noted,
possibly, more, the/ wonderful ; low notes,

It is money, of course, that ' explains
how the child, fastidiously cared \u25a0 f or, \u25a0as
she evidently, is,^ comes to be Inxvaude

was refused. Then, after much consid

and the Southern Nevada mining" districts the
world's greatest mining operators and experts.
They ' are ' comlnc in numbers and they are
bringing- their money -with them, \u25a0â too. Thus
far not a noted man who devotes his time
and attentlon-to mining has turned down the
Goldfleld or Bullfrog districts. They are. not
the.Vhorn-tootlng" variety;. they are not look
ing tor advertising, nor do they tell every
Tom. Dick or Harry of their acquisitions; yet
they are leaving" hundreds of thousands of dol
lars in " these districts and are ; at once : ar
ranging for the' active/ development of ;thÂ»
properties they are daily taking over. Surely
It's a great country, one which within a cer
tain thirty dsys attracts the personal attention
of John - Hay g Hammond;. William rScallon.
former preeldeht of the great Anaconda Com
pany and representative of the Amalgamated
Interests; Mr. Blossjm, personal representative
of P. Augustus. Heinze; Colonel Luce Of: the
Grand Central mine of Utah; Mr. Rice and
Mr. Farrell of the Qulncy and' Silver King
properties of Utah; the representatives of
Charles M. Schwab and John XV. Gates and
hundreds of others of more or less standing
in the mining world. Was there ever a coun
try known to be mineral bearing that~felt the
close scrutiny of so many experts' in such a
ebort -while? : .-,'-.
Bullion to the amount of $20,000 Is re
ported, by the Scott Valley Advance, to
have been taken out from the Russian
Creek district last week.
The Grass Valley Union says that bor
ing will soon- begin at Iron Mountain, Ne
vada County, to determine the values and
amounts of copper and Iron in'the.moun
tain. The copper Is supposed to be below
the Iron. -
Two gold dredges will "soon be, at work
on Yreka Creek, between Yreka Â£ and
Hawklnsville, to be operated by . electric
power furnished by the Yreka Electric
Light and Power Company plant at Shas

A cause originally advocated in Califor
nia, the creation of a Department '.of
Mines and Mining in the United States,
has found an advocate in Boston, in the
Twentieth Century Miner, which editori
ally asserts that engineers, investors.
Congressmen, business men and financiers
in the East have expressed . a strong de
sire for the department. The mineral in
dustry of the United States is producing
more, than ?1 .000,000,000 In: wealth every
year and. yet It has no direct representa
tion by a department devoted to Its pro
motion.
GOOD DEALS IX NEVADA.
J. McKane and C. M. Schwab have
bought the Great Eastern property at
â¢ Bullfrog, Nevada, for SSO.OOO. The Hicks
and Leavitt mines. S3 miles south .of
Beatty, have been bonded to T. L.. Oddle
for $150,000.
To prevent confusion the Beatty mining
district, which included a large part of
the' Bullfrog district, has been dissolved,
the claim owners having reached a unani
mous decision to merge the Beatty with
the Bullfrog district. .
According to the returns filed with the
County Assessor for purposes of taxation
by the Amalgamated Copper Company ot
Butte. Montana, the total net proceeds
for the last year were $8,692,243.52.
The Goldfleld Sun reports that the
United States Geological Survey will map
9000 square miles in Nevada mining dis
tricts at once. The Sun says:
The corps will be divided into four sections.
One will make a map of nine thousand square
miles, taking in all the new mining districts of
Southern Nevada, -while another - will atudy
the geological formations of the entire area
"mapped. One section will devote its entire
time to an investigation of the Goldfleld dis
trict, and the fourth party will run a line from
Goldfleld to Llda and the Bullfrog, district
for the purpose of determining the altitude
of all points studied. This line will connect,
west of Lida, with one run from the Pacific
Coast. It is estimated that the work will re
quire eight months. .
A great deposit of lime rock has been
discovered near Lompoc,; Santa Bar
bara County, of which the Santa Bar
bara Independent says: â¢
One quarry furnishes .all of the lime rock
used by the Union Sugar Company, whose
factory is at Betteravla, about eighteen miles
north "of Lompoc. In fact the company, owns
the quarry, and for the past two or three
years bas refused to sell any of their, lime
rock, although from ten to fifteen thousand
tons of It. could be sold to the Oxnard Com
pany, if they bo desired.
.The quarry has been worked for the past
six years, under the management of George
E. Badgley, and in that time between 50,000
and 60,000 tons of lime rock have been shipped,
about 20,000 tons of this having been shipped
to Oxnard three and four years ago. The.fac
tory at Betteravia \u25a0 uses about 6000 tons per
year: $10,000 per year Is spent for labor in
quarrying, hauling and loading rock on to the
-cars.
TO DREDGE NEAR CHICO.
Engineers have been prospecting
ground on Butte Creek, four miles east
of Chico. Dredging for gold In .that
neighborhood may be started.
' The Evening Star mine on Stock
Creek, Placer County, has-been bonded
to Messrs. O'Neil and Scribner of Oak
land.
TV. "L. Long has bonded lOOOacres of
land in the Rogue River Valley in Ore
gon to prospect for gold dredging.
One dredger is now working in that
section.
The St. Louis quartz mine in Willow
Valley, Nevada County, has been V pur
chased by J. F. Dietrichs and Joseph
Frederichs, according to the Nevada
City newspapers.
Parties are clearing out- the shaft of
the Mitchell mine, near. Pine Grove,
I A mador .County, that an inspection
may be made by parties, who are ne
gotiating for the purchase of the ( prop- ;
erty.
The Cala\'eras Prospect .reports that
the lands at the-. bottom, of. the] Cdla
veras River at Pittsburg will be pros
pected, preliminary to possible work
ing of the graver by the dredging, pro
cess. A bond has been secured' upon' a
large tract" embracing the bed of the
river.
The Los Angeles Mining Review -ref
ports that - John Haysy Hammond, act
ing with the Guggenheims, has pur*
chased the Piper Ranch in Inyo County,
f.or $76,000. 'This is twenty-threeTmiles
from Tule Canyon. f Through" the prop-.

" THE DISCIPLINE OF TAFT.
c â¢ . . : ... \u0084 ,_
|T is interesting to note the misunderstanding upon which it is
proposed to discipline Secretary Taft during his brief stay here,
I.en1 .en route to Manila. As the Secretary has already declined^all.
public receptions, and will only appear at one dinner, the coveted
"opportunity to heckle him will not occur, but that has nothing to do
with the supposed cause of the criticism to which it was proposed
to subject him. ' â¢ .
We have- -had -a treaty with China, which sets forth in minute
detail the rights, of Chinese in" this country. Laborers are .rigidly
excluded, by the assent -of their own. Government, and that exclu
sion" is further provided for by our exclusion act, passed in pur
suance .'of the treaty.. Both the treaty and the law provide that
Chinese merchants, students and travelers have the right of entry
and sojourn, and that to secure the same they, shall be certificated
at home and'-that their credentials shall be vised by American con
sular and diplomatic ' officers in China.
â¢ It will be observed that these exempts are not in the-immi-
at>ll." An immigrant is commonly understood to be
,qrie" wKp comes with the purpose of permanent settlement in the
1 country and with the right to follow any occupation as his interests
or his tastes may require. Merchants, students and travelers come
-.here with one fixed purpose only, and we have covenanted with
China -.that they, may come, land and pursue that purpose, under a
â¢ section 6 -.certificate. It came to pass that such certificate did not
protect "their right to land nor their privilege of sojourn. Our ad
. miiiistrative officers came to regard the certificate not as prima facie
â¢ evidence of the right to. land, but as prima facie evidence of crime.
-Out of this construction of the certificate came acts of oppression of
'-members of the exempt classes that were not creditable to us as a
â¢ riajibn;.. and that impeached our good faith in keeping our covenant
"..with"' China. . . \u25a0}' C
.1 .-Every one remembers the case of the Christian Chinese lady,
'â¢an educated woman and a teacher, who was 'kept in revolting cus
- tbdy ; here' in:' the- miserable prison called a "detention shed" for
â¢ â¢weeks', because her husband, a rich Chinese merchant in New York,
\u25a0 hid among his investments one in a restaurant, and therefore, by a
\u25a0â¢hideously fantastic construction of the- law, was a laborer. A Chi
c'nese laborer, haying under our wise" and beneficent law no right to
a -wife; this' "lady" was held a prisoner in this Christian city, and
* finally : t)eing sent out of the country, went through Canada to Mon
treal', where she succeeded in proving her status as a teacher and
â¢â¢was- 'permitted to .enter, a country that is full of the altars of that
Christianity, "of which she is a. professor. She had a section 6 cer
tificate.as" a merchant's wife, but was treated as a river woman and
wanton.' .It .is merely fantastic to argue that such things are nec
""iessary to protect .the country from an invasion by coolies, for they
are' not. \u25a0 ':...-â¢
\u0084 'â¢\u25a0'. Tit-is equally fantastic and unjust to accuse Secretary Taft of
'favoring a. coolie invasion, because he raised the voice of a fair play
American; a Christian .and a statesman, against classifying all Chi
â¢neseas coolies,.^nd denying to all the common rights of humanity. .
*; ;,* *. It. is true' that our commercial interests were involved, and that
fact has. caused columns of ink and much vocal effort to be spent
." in exhortations about putting the sale of a few bolts of brown cot
ton'against the/ rights of American manhood. Men who are not
known on the list' as philanthropists in their daily walk have heatedly
discussed the need of putting the man above the dollar. Our proper
commercial policy- in Eastern Asia means keeping the man and
the dollar together. .Each is lonesome and inefficient without the
other. Every .bolt of the much despised brown cotton sold in China
.; means dollars for American labor and profit for American business
enterprise.* If" these can be ours by keeping our covenant with
China and treating fairly the Chinese merchants who come here to
foster our trade- with their country, and 1 the students who come to
.carry our learning into the emancipation of their own people, and
â¢ the travelers who come*to spend money here and study our people
and'our institutions, we demand to know who will be hurt by it.
Xo" doubt there are some who think there is fire enough left
in the'ashes of the Chinese -coolie question to produce a few more
offices for men who declare that the ashes are still hot. But men
of sense, with no" ax of ambition to grind, know that our proper
national policy requires that we put China -on equality with other
nations and that we follow the advice of Mr. Sargent, the Com
missioner of Immigration, by. shutting out the coolies of South
eastern Europe and of- Eastern Asia, at the same time treating other
classes with due courtesy and consideration. i^%
If Secretary -.Taft deserve the discipline and heckle aimed at
him, we -should .recall every Christian missionary from Eastern
Asia,- dismantle our -steamer lines to that coast, and, in the interest
of "the man" just qbw beloved of the Secretary's critics, establish
entire, non-intercourse with a people whom we will declare un
wojthy of worship at our altars, to set foot on our soil or. to con
sume orir merchandise*
CONGO FREE STATE.
TN Brussels there '"is a "federation for the defense of Belgian in
1 tcr?sts abroad," and it has recently issued a pamphlet called
-"\u25a0"'the truth oh the Congo Free State." It must, of course, be to
some extent a one-sided view of the dissatisfaction existing in. some
qnarters as to the way the Free State is managed, but it is not
wholly so, for.it consists mainly of extracts and testimonies from
c books and papers other than Belgian. The complaint against King
Leopold's African protectorate is raised principally by what is a
called a noisy crowd of missionaries and Liverpool merchants.
* English irrdiarubber- merchants want more opportunities to trade
. in the Congo State. They object to the system of concessions by
which Belgian- authority controls the situation. The Minister of
Colonies in France, who was charged with the mission of inquiring
into French Congo, reports favorably on the system of concessions.
It seems the established and necessary way to exercise desirable
control. * f
"'Whatever may be the defects of King Leopold's rule in Africa,
the testimony, of disinterested parties who have studied Congo con
ditions, among them the Englishman, Lord Mountmorres, who trav
elejd* through it questioning all the chiefs, shows that in great re
sults the light of improvement let into the Dark Continent by Leo
pold's efforts, makes Belgian rule worthy of much praise. It is,
.'indeed* one of the great achievements of modern civilization. Just
for one item, cannibalism* has been abolished, except in rare in
stances, over a. vast area and an immense population ; the wonder
of it being that there is scarcely a native in the Free State over 25
years of age "who did not in his youth participate in, .cannibalistic
preying on Iris fellow "beings. For other improvements/ slavery has
been stopped, methods of transportation developed,' industries
taught, remarkable material prosperity maintained, and the; people
made so satisfied that the chiefs give testimony that the adventof
the white man was a great blessing.
King Leopold is said to be getting very rich, from his Congo
possessions. He probably is entitled to these: late: coming gains, for
during a' long period of years he 'devoted -his surplus : revenue to
making a success of the great undertaking the authorities of Europe
turned over to him in. trust. '-'S.--':

WHEN THE POWERS DECIDE THE FATE OF MOROCCO
HOW THE MORMONS DECEIVE
lUST how far some of the statements,
made with all solemnity and apparent
sincerity by the Mormon; Bureau of
Information, may be depended upon
as true, may be illustrated by" an in
cident-enacted a few months ago, says
Marian Bonsall in . her article on * "The
Tragedy of the Mormon Woman, ". in the;
July Housekeeper. An Eastern I clergy
man, visiting in Utah, requested of a Gen
tile friend livnig in the city to be shown
the sights of the handsome: square about
the Temple. ..Together with his friend he
registered at the Information Building,,
where they were met with a guide, as
are all visitors. The/guide was a fine,
looking and . extraordinarily.,; intelligent
young woman of about 23 years of age, 1
apparently, well dressed and of aristo
cratic carriage,, who showed the visitors'
the A Assemhl >V: Hall : and ttbe::Tabernacle,
explaining^ readily and- comprehendingly
various principles of the Mormon faith. '-
When asked of : the relation of polygamy
to the church, the. young woman answer-,
ed, without hesitation, , that g the f church
regarded the principle as true, but had
suspended :ihe ' practice . under the ad
monition of the maplfesto. .'
The Eastern clergyman was much im-
has been supposed. (Government can accomplish ;part : of this by
creating; conditions to /favor . rise in wages 1 and accumulation \u25a0\u25a0 of
wealth. He , does not underrate ; static economics, the determination
of fixed principles; but he ; holds out a prospect of-a larger human
control of social welfare based on a study of the underlying, causes
of these principles: '^ .-.
The . paper touches lightly upon three subjects' of economic .in
vestigation : the- rewards of capital, the increase of '.capital, and the
probabilities "'of invention underjchanging; social conditions. On the
first two of these; subjects he advances as new some most encour
aging ideas to replace' the old and generally accepted theories; about
the principles which ;control them. In '".regard io the^seemingly, in
controvertible jawV of Malthus, ithat;thc ; wages of laborers; must:
always be low. because: :the \u25a0increased prosperity, wpuld inevitably be
followed by an increase;in population'^ which, would again; \u25a0feduce';the
price of work, he explains that^it :is 'beginning: to i be evident that
the rise in workmen's- pay, tends to perpetuate rather, than to check;
itself. Education and living on; a; higher Uevel tend; to 'reduce the
birth rate, and the higher wages give the opportunity and the in
clination for this education and \larger;livirig.;; v .. ; ; ; '/.; '. \u25a0''\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0_.-. r : -

LITTLE MYSTERIES OF LIFE
j IFE is full .of little inexplicable
I â¢:â¢ mysteries. They occur everyd ay,
*"^ and are passed by as being merely
fV." ordinary. Whenever the .conver
sation turns on ; mental telepathy or the
occult sciences there is always some one
who has story of the mysterious to
tell, says a contributor to Pearson's
Weekly.-;
About ten years ago, on a large open
tract of land in the north of London (now
fortunately covered with red brick villas),
a ; number of boys were \u25a0 playing cricket.
Suddenly there came a loud, humming
noise, like the combined droning of thou
sands of ; bees, and a great atone, larger
than a man's fist, whizzed across the cen
ter, of the pitch and embedded itself in a
bank.. Almost immediately it "was fol
lowed by ; another, and ' then ; a third. ?
\u25a0-. Although ; they. waited in hiding for \u25a0
some time there was no repetition of thÂ«,;
mysterious missiles. The question then
arose,*- Where .could they ' have -come
from ? The nearest house was quite \u25a0 400
yards away, and a machine to have sent
these large -stones whirling at such a
frightful pace over this distance '; would
be rather an extraordinary article of fur
niture I for a . suburban v villa. So the
cause ;of this v remarkable occurrence yet
requires /explanation. ~>
' In i the same < district, a few years back,
four young: men were seated sin a room
playing whist. Â£ Suddenly, "just after mid
night, the door, which . had been latched,
opened . slowly until it had reached its
fullest limit.
'\u25a0:â¢', In ; surprise the players , looked up, but
no one was standing in the : doorway.
Then, ere one of them " could move, the
door . slowly , closed \u25a0 itself * again. :. Imme
diately one of the young men jumped up,
pulled the door open, and stared up and
down the hall,. but there was absolute si
lence and no 'one about. \u25a0

' . Suddenly he heard three distinct taps
at a large. French window which opened;
Into the garden. Looking up,, his gaze
met . that of his friend's, and he saw a
sudden pallor come into the latter* 3 face.
Afterward he mentioned the occurrence,
and * received the reply that it was the
death tap ho had 'heard. Surely enough
a telegram arrived on ths following; day
to say that hts friend's grandmother was
dead.
Another instance occurred In thÂ»
writer's own family. A lady dreamed
that-she' was journeying to the west of
Er.sland. At Swlndon she left the train
and waited in the waiting room until a
branch connection, arrived. . Suddenly sho
\u25a0 looked up at the clock and saw ' that ; it
registered 7:15. At that moment a denso
blackness came over the scene,* and she'
remembered nothing more.
The, next day the news arrived ; that :
her mother had died at 7:13 that sama
morning in her home in the- west of Eng
land.
Some years ago a gentleman was seated
at a table busily writing. At the moment
he was alone In the house. Suddenly he
heard. the patter of feet outside the door,
and then tha sound of a dogr barking.
Going: outside the room he saw, to bis
surprise, that bis dog had found its way
from the! garden Into the house, and for
some inconceivable reason was violently
barking. . . ' . .
Crash! The room behind him was sud
denly in darkness, and a smell of escap
ing gas . pervaded ;. the : air. - Directly ;he
understood what had happened, and hur
ried to seal -up the . broken pipe , of ; tkÂ»
chandelier. The latter . was ; lying to a
thousand ; pieces on the floor..
But i for the . mysterious instinct that
caused the dog to enter â¢ the house a : nd
attract this gentleman's attention " he
would probably have been killed by the
falling chandelter, for he had been sitting
directly beneath it.

Â»of the woman, the serpent and the
tree. Is sent, forth "from Life of New
York." Naturally you know it must be
clever it Life issued it. It Is not only
from Life of New York, but it is from
life everywhere. It is true to a part
of life that is everywhere because it
tells of the thought of a human being,
mixed of good and evil, who desired to
Jive her life fully â to satisfy every
emotion with which nature had en
dowed her. and finding in her case con
vention was .a bar she broke through
social law to find that full life.
'In the confession^ which Is written
inUhe. form of a diary, she writes on
one page that stock recipe against
heartache for erring "women the wide
tv-orl'd over, "The easiest way to be
happy is not to think." However, this
seeker after happiness on the wrong
trail His thought a great deal, and it is
for this reason perhaps that her con
fession, comes visual to the public
rather than having been auricular to
the priest* and' buried in the bosom of
holy church forever. I\, purports to be
â¢ written by Helen .Woljeska, born in
Vienna, of happy and distinguished
parents. At 14 she Is In the back
woods of America, working hard, and
Is in dread- that she is always to be
isolated from that full life which she
craved. RescueTl from that fate she
goes to ?n art school in a big city.
Then .comes studio life, "and now be
gan a glorious life of art. love, youth,
freedom^ success and pleasure â every
thing united. And there were days
| when she thought herself the happiest
of women, when she was triumphant,
ablaze, intoxicated, with the Joy of life.

Eihllated her that what she had taken
to be the genuine gold of life* was but
a cheap 'and. tinseled imitationâ that
stm had llv#d In a fool's paradise."
After these ashes -she tried to begin
Ufe all "over again, based on simplicity
and truth, but 'she found she -could not
As a last refuge she threw her whole
heart upon the hope ol motherhood as
the only happiness left for her. Be
fttre the child was born a fever came
tJpon Helen Woljeska. and she died a
.lingering death. 'The friend from
whose*^ove "she had expected the res
urrection of her youth and gladness
had gone from her." So she passed
long lonely days -till the uncomforted
end came.
These facts furnish the key by which
you may better understand the ex
tracts from her diary" which I am to
give to you. Be these confessions fact
or fiction, â¢ they are important, for If
Helen Woljeska of Vienna did not write
them, some one closer in time and place
probably has bad* the mental experi
ences which this writer has expressed
for her. The confession Is only a part
of tne worth of the book; it is full of
ponderable maxims, some wise and
some warnful In the vitality of their
error â to live that It takes a resolutely
militant morality to kill them and
*throw them out one's. heart.
"You should .not read books to for
get life â but to .understand it more
â¢ fully and enjoy it more keenly."
"1 have not lived as I did through
recklessness or I wanted to
live a clean, strong, true life, free from
â¢conventionality and .artificiality and
triviality â and I did. But nobody will
understand. As far as lam concerned
It is a matter of absolute indifference
what you may think of me. But for
the child. This is why I humble my
self to expjain."
"Yes, I did, wrong. Not. because I
?ave myself without the foolish cere
mony of marriage. But because I gave
myself to* a man "who U not worth a
"Roman's love."
-"I cannot blame a mah for being
what he is. I can only blame myself
for having mistaken him to be some
thing else." /
"What more terrible gTfef can there
be than that of a mother who dies and
3:: is to leave her little helpless child
among people 'who did . love the
roother and will not love the child.
* * â¢ And whatever your fate may
be, little child, you cannot suffer: much
more wretchedly than I am suffering,
and still I love life, I lore it,, l love it !

"Th/> woman who gives herself with

not a sinnerâ only a poor fool. : ; She ii
means to be heroic and is ' pitifully', un- â¢
piactical. Ar.d the man she loves- will
be the first to Judge her" from" the
orthodox standpoint."
"If you do not wish to suffer you
'must not enjoy either. The two are
Inseparable. And if you , enjoy much

"Never half."
"You may hurry if you wish to. But
events will not be rushed. They come
in their own time."
"A Jealous man is unpleasant, but
one you could not make jealous would
be worse."
"Better say nothing and do nothing,
than say a word or do a deed that will

"Give a child the chance to be happy

It may be interesting to know some
thing: of the beginnings of this character.
Here are some cullings. from what she
wrote when she was a girl of 14:
"The aim of. living is to enjoy oneself.
Bo much is certain, I will live, I will not
vegetate. Give yourself freely \u25a0to every
emotion. I do not believe that I am in
tended for family life, but for the free,
wide world. I want to be loved by a great
many men. But I will not belong to one
of them.- There is no place like a prison
to teach the love of freedom." â¢
When she was at the art school she put
this down in her diary: "Never write, or
paint, or do anything unless you feel it
alive within you and striving for expres
sion. Such workjhas a right of existence
and a life and strength of its own. But
weak, half-hearted things are better left
unsaid and undone."
During her studio life she wrote:
"I am not afraid of a happiness because
it 1 cannot last Let the end come as death.
While I can I .will enjoy fully, without
all my senses, to the last limit"
I have been saving the best for the last
Here Is one of them:
i "I want to be comforted. I want to pray
to you, God. But I must send up my soul
if I wish to reach, you. And my soulls 1
very ; tired. It cannot fly so high. And
you do not come down to me. So I am
alone, alone, alone." .
And now to take leave of this woman,
strangely mixed of strength and weak-^
ness, here is the best paragraph, >he'
wrote, and in the last clause of that para
graph she gets closer to - God \u25a0 than else
where In all her confession: !
â¢'One day my child will ask me, 'where
is God?* and I shall answer, 'everywhere/
And ray child will ask me, 'what is God?'
and I shall answer, 'the good,, the true,
the glad, the beautiful and strong in,
everybody and "everything.' And my child
will ask, 'what is the bad?' and I shall
answer, 'that which has not" become gpd
like yet, but will be bo by? and", by//' \u25a0

for, young people. It. does 'not "include'
history, . sciences philosophy , or cconoinics,'
but' deals ', with ; the" wrltinjc ; that'is ' more
THEfSAN^RA^
distinctively called "literature." In that
restriction there Is left the reading that
tells us of the human heart and-emo
tion, including j Intellectual emotion. ,
The purpose of Cody's little book'^is to
give to as wide a circle as. possible .the
opportunity of spending a certain
amount of tlmf every week in 'the
world's best society. That is, in so far
as books bring it home to- us. .The
works he points out as desirable are
for recreation. For that function'they
must be creative; something positive,
vital, strong and human.; After. telling
us that too close a picture of our actual
lives cannot be, interesting, ;he says:
"A work of literature should give us
ourselves idealized and in adream, all
we wished to be but could" not be. all
we hoped for but missed.- : True litera
ture rounds out our lives, gives uscon
solatlon # for our failures, rebuke for
our vices, suggestions for our, ambition,
hope and love, and appreciation. To do
thatÂ«it should have truth/ nobility and
beautjrtn a high degree." - :â¢
Beginning the book with, a teaching of
what constitutes a good poem. the writer
tries to awaken appreciation/ and "put
sorrow and unrest asletep, with the lullaby
tmm Tennyson's Princess:
Sweet and low, sweet and. .'low, *. t C
Wind of the Western Sea â¢ ' t. - '
Low, low. breathe and blow.
Wind,of the Westefn Sea! \u25a0 i .*i':-. <:
Over the rolling waters go, 'â¢\u25a0â¢-'\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 ''.;,;
Com* from the dying moon,"' and blow.
Blow hlm-agaln to me;
. While my, little one, while my pretty one,
. sleeps. , --, \u25a0 ,-/"c \u25a0-- '\u25a0- ' '
Of course he remembers to tell you that
to , get the good of a poem you must
read it aloud. The genesis of the thing
is that you begin with a liking and go
on to another, liking. The lullaby Is sim
ply an appeal to our feelings, and does
it with enchanting sound. Next, he
chooses something from Shelley. This
adds to the beauty of the music a more
definite thought lhan : Was in the lullaby:
) The fountains mingle with 'the river.
And the rivers with the ocean;
The winds of heaven mix forever
With a sweet emotion; â¢ ;\u25a0 .; j.-
And the sunlight clasps the earth, .
- And the moonbeams kiss the eea.
What are all these kisslngg- worth
If thou'klss not me? , â¢-\u0084.
Then he takes us farther along to a
poem fwhlch has not only the melody
and the thought- of these ; two samples,
but adds; to them; an elementof nobility,:
of moral inspiration. It .is Longfellow's
well-known Psalm of Life:
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
Is our destined end or way; ".-.
But to act, that each to-morrow.-.
\u25a0--. Find us farther; than to : day. \u25a0
Having been thus initiated, we can now
go on stronger 'wing with : Browning's
magnificent "Rabbi Ben Ezra" ;
ThPn welcome each . rebuff ;
That turns . earth's smoothness rough, '
Each' sting - that : bids - not ' Bit' : nor stand,
\u25a0 - .but go. -/\u25a0"--\u25a0\u25a0..' .â:> V. '-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0- !.;\u25a0â¢ â¢'._â¢.. â¢ .
Be our Joys three parts pain!'
Strive and hold cheap the strain; / -\u25a0â¢ .
, Learn, nor account the pang: dare,- never
\u0084: grudge the throe! '. .
The ring of that is to! confirm courage
by philosophy.^ He, quotes five stanzas of
this poem, ending with the one which con
tains the lines, "All I could never be, that
was I worth to God." . . t _
' Even beyond this, Cody takes .us .t<T a
poem he considers < still- more : lofty."-;* It ; Is
from - the: thoughts, '* that ci Words worth
wrote near "Tintern Abbey.";, It has the
lines about: 1 , ;
That serena and blessed mood,
In which the affections gently; lead us .on,;. â¢
Until.- the- breath of this \u25a0 corporeal frame,' '\u25a0'
And \u25a0 even the motion sof our \u25a0. human â¢-. blood, \

Brooks Writes
of Tamalpais
Scribner's Magazine for July has aa ap-*
preciative account by Benjamin Brooks of
"the region of Tamalpais. a mere dot on
the map, yet inexhaustible, like its trails,
and of infinite beauty and variety. . . .
fairest of all California In the winter
time, . . . and yet. by some oversight,
unknown to the world In general, and un
sung!"
The writer has lived the camp life up
there and loved it. He has sot lost up
there and laughed over it. He has min
gled with the frequenters of the mountain
trailsâ the hill tribes, and liked them.
These people taught him how to dwell in
the woods without marring: them. How to
cook and hide all evidence that
he had been cooking. How r to
have lire without risk to the for
ests. How to find the softest beds of pine
needles, and where were the hoMow
stumps that hide the skillets. Among the
hill tribes are plant hifnters who love bot
any, but less than the sweep of the sub
lime 3cenery: artists who find a new pic
ture and live in It for a week; and poets
who. think "one is above rhyming and
that sort of thing out here."
In describingr the "Land of Tamalpais"
one of the things the writer presents to
us as having surprised hfm most was the
vast extent of. the Pacific which he could
see at one view from. his perch of eighteen
hundred feet above the se.v "The gjreat
height, the tremendous distances, the cu
bic miles cf air under me. grVually sunk
in upon me with their full significance as
I looked from headland to headland. / . .
it was a sight impossible to get used to.
for all this blue surface was' standing
straight on edge, as if it bad been painted
on the curtain of a theater." Most won
derful of all his experiences up there Is
this: "When I woke the next morning
the east shone wide, and three great
planets were miraculously hung high in
the coming light, as though they floated
there. It was a wonderful sight; yet close
on the eastern horizon lay a long black
silhouette which was more wonderful still-
Strange new mountains I had never heard
of. and that were not on that part of the
map, stood before mo as plain as day. I
scanned their entire length for a familiar
peak, but none appeared. There .was a
great dome standing up among the re3t
like a cathedral in a city, and It was
split sheer in two, like the South Dome in
the- Yosemite! It was the South ' Dome!
The idea came to me at' last. I was look
ing clear across California and Into the
Yosemite itself, two hundred miles away."

:-;.sf.- PETERSBURG. July 2. 0 a. m.
â¢_. '-'khfe St Andrew 1 * fias is now flying: from
'Ji.hq masthead of the Kriaz Petemkine."
'^ 'Aft Odessa-.dlspatch received here at 2
â¢o'clock this morning reports in these
Turd's the surrender of Ihe battleship by
\hef.-''taiutlnous crew, and adds that a
â¢ steamship, has. gone out to the Kniaz
â¢ â¢â¢Potemkine'trith a supply of provisions.
â¢ 'This .was the first definite statement
. T=ccei.ved In St. Petersburg regarding the
surrender of the battleship and the dl<=
'.'patch, which leaves so many details yet
to.be j;p. ts accepted here with
\u25a0..caution.' and until it is fully established
V tha<- ah adequate guard has been placed

.â¢restored to her commissioned officers ap
' prehension that the revolt will break out
c : ?rain will not be ended.
'During: Saturday St. Petersburg was
" vr.lthout definite knowledge as to whether
><^c" crew of the Kniaz Potemkine had
\u25a0 re.tiir.Hed to its allegiance or whether the
':Â«>vclt* continued and, perhaps, had
Ifpread to other ships. The inability of
. ihe X3overnraent to. announce an end to
'â¢ the' uprising: gave rise to the darkest re
ports. The few dispatches which arrived
yesterday through the official agency
were evidently carefully censored and
lacked reference to the mutiny, but the
details they have about the hurried em
placement of coast artillery on positions
commanding the harbor and the action
of -the authorities In allowing the -crew
t*o purchase provisions seemed to augur

COSTSCL'S* REPORTS XOT CLEAR.
â¢ The dlrpatch of Consul Feenan an
nouncing the- surrender of the crew of
.the Kniaz Potemkine gave a report that
â¢other chips of the Black Sea fleet had
nwitlnled. and declared, though not defi
nitely, that two warships, evidently the
KnJai Potemkine and the Georgi Poble
â¢Ccnosetz, were in the harbor, but no
mention was made as to whether the re
vel* continued. *
â¢ Altogether It peems apparent that the'
submission of the sailors of the Kniaz
Potemkine to Vice Admiral Kruger's
' tQuadron on Friday was only temporary"
ftnd. that the mutineers had changed
.their irflnds after the return to the har
â¢ i>pr and the departure of the squadron.
c Â« "Vrjiether.the crew of the Georgi Poble
idonosetz was sp.ared disaffection is not
definitely known, but the men cfn the
Kr.irrf Potemkine evidently .vacillated for
o a long time as to whether they should

DISPATCHES /ARC CONFLICTING.
London Unable to Fathom the Real
Situation at Otlr.isa.
LONDON, July I.â A private telegram
was received here from Odessa, timed 10
o'clock this morning, which said:
"The men of a second battleship have
mutinied. Can see no possibility of an
early resumption of work. The position
undoubtedly Is critical."
A plspatch received by Reuters tele
gram Company from St. Petersburg to
day confirmed the statement made in the
dispatches from Odessa last ,nlght. to
the effect that the mutineers of the Kniaz
Potemkine surrendered to Rear Admiral
j Kruger.
A private telegram from Odessa, -timed
11:20 o'clock this morning, said the city
was quiet and orderly. There are plenty
of troops, i
Thus the accounts of the events at
Odessa ) received In London continue to
conflict. While the private telegram this
morning confirmed the report of mutiny
on board Russian battleships. another
message sent off at about midnight; said
that, when Vice Admiral Kruger's
squadron departed, theTAdmiral left be
hind two battleships, at ! the" ; urgent re
quest of the Military Governor, who -was
distrustful of the situation, even with 30,
000 troops at his disposal. ; It is consid
ered possible here that this may have
given; rise -to* the; story denying the sur
render of the Kniaz Potemkine. \u0084. ; ~
.' The specials from) Odessa dated late
Friday night say the city.up to Uiat Ume
was quiet, but that It had the appearance
of being under the occupation of; a hos
tile army. . Groups [ of : soldiers were, sta
tioned \ at every 100 paces â¢In the streets
and by; order of the Governor the .elec
tricity and gas were ' cut off, leaving the
streets in /complete "darkness. â¢ Railway
communications . to the north have been
interrupted for four days.. '\u25a0'\u25a0; \u25a0;.#\u25a0
Later, to-day a private message was re
ceived from Odessa, saylne that the flrea
were extinguished and ':. that i the \ sender
expected the town would resume .its nor-,
mal state In a few days, directly after the
trouble with the fleet wasl settled.^:
"It is said . that ; 300 charred: corpses jof

and comprehensive method of sending

sending ..a message by cable, there are
)iishdrej3s of thousands of pounds of

-there is no* such restriction at all. It is
Just .'as. .easy to send twenty messages at.

â¢not a\ very long time, either, it will be
\u25a0possible -to 'sehd a thousand words a

of course, requires special automatic in-

' TEX COUNTS 'IX IXDICTMEXTS.
The indictments voted # ; for alleged
violation , of the anti-trust law 'were
Identical in each instance. The indict
ments contained- ten counts, each. The
first and second counts pertained , only
to goods sold in domestic trade. The
third charges a. conspiracy in restraint
of trade and commerce . among the
States and with foreign nations in
fresh, dried, smoked, cured,' canned and
pickled meats and in certain.-, by
products of the packing industry, viz:
Sausage casing, sausage containers,
oleo stock, stearine and oils, and also
In butter, eggs and poultry. This count
charges that the trade which the de
fendants were carrying on In these
commodities was to be restrained "in
several ways:
First â Competition in the buying of
cattle at the stockyards In different
cities was to be prevented and de
stroyed by the defendants, who required
their purchasing agents to refrain from
testifying against each other.
Secondâ Competition as to the sale, of
the commodities in foreign and domestic
markets was to be prevented and j de
stroyed by the defendants fixing non
competitive and unreasonable prices for
such commodities, and requiring their
representatives of the different markets
to. fix prices by agreement from day to
day, according to what the market
would stand./ _ .
Third â The supply of the commodities
was to be curtailed 'and restricted,
whenever necessary, to maintain the
prices so fixed. . =
Fourthâ The United States was" di
vided into, territories between the de-.
fendants and each was to keep its own

A SUDDEN TWINGE
Of pain is generally the- first warning
of an attack of rheumatism. It feels
as if the s disease - were in the . bones
or muscles, but th* real cause of
rheumatism is
found In Impure
blood. In order to
cure- rheumatism
the. blood must -be
cleansed of the poi-
sonous - impurities
which- are the
cause of the dis-
ease. X " : - : '\u25a0'

Dlsoovery has been

of the disease. -

Fifthâ There was a division as to the

fendant in a given : market;" if one
packer < sold more than T hisl percentage
during a given week.^he ,was obliged
to pay an "ante". of so â¢ much per hun-r
dred weight, according to the. terri-^
torj' in- which the matter occurred: into
a pool of excess of sales and this fund
was divided ..among J the packers who
fell short on their sales. , .
Sixthâ Certain corporations, namely,' the
Aetna Trading Company and the, Oppen

to make arrangements { with . the several
concerns .which; had \u25a0. been handling such
merchandise in the markets of the world
for working In harmony , and ; controlling
the output and price of : the merchandise.
This I scheme involved ;the. destruction or
"tanking" rof large quantities of \u25a0 casings,
whenever the supply,,was v too great. - "
,The Kenwood another cor
poration, -was ,< to : handle bleo 'oils and
products on substantially the same lines,

yÂ«'t ii long way from freedom.
! Tho Jury retired at 3:35 o'clock yes
tÂ«rdoy uftornoon. Almost the entire

tho defense. This was the only time
during the whole trial that Minnie Ad
ams threw off her steeled veil of ap
athy and gave vent to'her inner feel
litks.; The*- lawyer' pictured the actual
Â«ln of the woman defendant, that of
living with Grey without the vows of
mnrrlago, and then told the jury that
\u25a0he had more* than atoned for the way
wardness in the six* years that she had
spent in the County Jail. - '
"Go back." /he said, "and I believe you
willâ go backâ to that old father of yours
who loves you as he did, when you first
sinned. Go back to him and live the rest
of your life an example of. perfect.wom
anhood before your children." Minnie
Adams was softly crying; the father of
the woman reached I over and with j tears
In his own eyes he put bis arm on her
"shoulder and gave her a little bunch of
wild flowers that he had picked ln^ the
earl jr> dew of morning. Half of the
people in the crowded courtroom felt
their throats swell with sympathetic sobs,
and" they turned away to hide _ their
tears.- '-v Â«'â¢â¢- -t \u0084- .- ' .: . \u25a0\u25a0:- ,
At 6 o'clock there was the expectant
stir that always precedes the coming out
of the jury. In a moment, the jurors
were backv in :their places. "Have you
reached .a verdict?";. There was the hush
of death. Minnie Adams leaned forward
anxiously. "No," was the. disappointing
answer made -to Judge Lawlor, "we ask
that you re-read the instructions.".- Then
they retired again. At 7 o'clock they were

BEKI<TN. July Lâ "Wlfleapreafl sorrow
hÂ»Â»*been c&saed throughout the Father-
Un4*br-the news that Eugen Richter,
the.yeteran Liberal statesman, parliamen
terlsA and orator, has been stricken with
total blinds ess in consequence of a long
and-'palnful illness. His enforced retire
- meat from publio affairs ends an active
â¢ political, career cf over forty years and
removes from the arena of Government
11/ e perhaps the most - picturesque figure
German politics has ever produced, with
the'slngl'* exception of Bismarck.
Richter will be Bixty-Beven years old
In Jtely cf this year. His chief claim to"
'fame as a politician is that of having
been Bismarck's most implacable an
tagonist. The Iron Chancellor always
feared Bichter- as an opponent in -the
Reichstag and frequently admitted that
-he was the only enemy whose mettle he
respected. x
\u0084 .For decades Rlchter has held unchal
â¢ Icnged "place as the most brilliant Parlia
mentary orator In Germany. He has al
ways been in opposition and although his
â¢party, or "faction," as it is called in
Germany â the "Frelsinnlge Volkspartle"
(Liberal People's Party)â has dwindled to
numerical Impotence in consequence, of
the. rise of the social democracy, Rich
ter's .forceful personality has remained
ac potent as ever and no Reichstag
speaker commands more attention, when
he takes the tribune, than "rilver-tongued
. Eugren," as he is familiarly known.
Of leonine cast of countenance and rug
ged frame, Richter looks, the fighter he
*has"alwaYB been. He had an intense dis
\like for Bismarck and opposed him tooth
â¢Snd^nalL For years Richter -specialized
"- iv -"financial legislation and he caused
"aioce trouble for Bismarck's military and
\u25a0naval budget than aU the rest of the
.ftriehstag rut together. He was a rec
' osxiized authority on Government finance
1 and..his voice was so persistently lifted in
"favor cf economies that he .ranks easily
as. Germany's "watchdog of. the treas
ury/ Had his Parliamentary strength
. been* heavier, the Kaiser's army and
" navy- would never have attained their
-presJjjit 6plendid proportions, for he has
\u25a0fciight appropriation after appropriation
for the increase of the Fatherland's land
arrd sea armament.
â¢Elchter is a â¢Rhinelander. having been
"bora in Duesseldorf, the Pittsburg of Ger
many, in IS3B. He was graduated from
"Heidelberg and Berlin universities, and
\u25a0while at the" latter spent more time
' studying .Parliamentary matters than
over "his books and theses. He entered
thevPrussian Diet in ISSI, and was elected
, to represent a Berlin constituency in the
\u25a0first Reichstag, formed after the estab- ,
lishment of the German empire in ISTU
He has been re-elected continuously .ever
..since.
Besides his Parliamentary and party ac
â¢tlvitx, he has found time to write copi
9Usly and. to edit the daily organ of his
party, the "F^jeisinnige Zeltung." publish
etl'ln Berlin. Much of the Reichstag's In
â¢terest for the public will be lost, now
â¢that this picturesque figure has disap
peared, and his bitterest antagonists
grieve that the sad fate of, blindness
Khculd have overtaken Richter at the end
of his long- and strenuous career.

Been Given to the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company
KANSAS CITY, July I.â Contempt
proceedings against the Atchison, To
peka aud Santa Fe Railway Company,
charging that company with being
guilty of violation of an injunction Is
sued at Kansas City by Judge F. Phil
lips on March 24, 1902. restraining the
road from giving rebates, was filed in
the United States District Court here
to-day at the Instigation of Milton D.
Purdy of Washington, D. C, Assistant
Attorney General, who cams here re
cently at the direction of the Attorney
General to file the suit upon behalf of
the Government.
Although Judge Phillips' restrain
ing order. Issued three yars ago, was
directed against seven other railroad
companies besides the Atchison,' Topeka
and Santa Fe, the suit tiled to-day is
eolÂ«ly against the ' latter road. ThÂ«!
other railways enjoined previously by
Judge Phillips were the Chicago. Bur
lington and Qulncy, Chicago and Alton.
Missouri Paclnc, the Wabash, Chicago,
Milwaukee ami St, Paul, Chicago, Rock
Island and J ; acific and the Chicago
Great Western. A' similar order; was
issued by Judge ,Grosscup in Chicago
on March 25. iaO2, against six other
roads.
The suit filed to-day at the instiga-'
tlon of the Federal Government recites
that the Santa Fe Railway, up to the
time the injunction was granted, had
been engaged In the practice of grant
ing unlawful rebates and preferential
ratej and facilities to certain favoretl
shippers, whose names' '. were to the
complainants unknown, on traffic in
packing-house products, dressed meats.
grain and the products of grain, which
were not granted to the public gener
ally; and that the Santa Fe Railroad
had also been granting unlawful re
bates and facilities to certain other fa
vored shippers on many other of thiÂ»
principal commodities Tvhif.h consti
tuted and comprised the ordinary ne
cessities of life.
The information, after noting the is
suance of the restraining order on
Jlarch 24, 1802, says that between
March 26, 190.! and November 27, 19<H,
the Santa Fe Hallway Company and its
officers and agents unlawfully, willful
ly and knowingly violated and disre
garded the said restraining order.
The information asserts specifically
that the Santa Pc favored the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company in giving rates
on coal, saying It carried the coal, of
said company "at a less rate 'than the
rates named for such services in de
fendant's published -ami' established
schedules and granted' and paid rebates
to said Colorado Fuel and Iron Com
pany."
The information asserts that the
Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe . Rail
way is in . contempt "for the. 'willful
and repeated violations' of said tem
porary restraining order," and asks the
Federal court to cite the company's of
ficials to apper in court and make
answer for such acts.
Judge Phillips did not Indicate to
day what action he might take in the
matter. . i /-\u25a0;;-;;.-: . '

A Generous Donation.
On the first page of the June4ssue of
St. Joseph's Union there Is a fine half
tone of the "Ford Model F" automobile
sold by the Holle Automobile and Man
ufacturing Co., Inc., of IS 14, Market
street, San Francisco. This machine
was purchased and presented to the
Youths' Directory by a generous friend
of that Institution, for, the Directoryto
make such use of as it > might deem
proper. The automobile r . has \u25a0 a side
door, detachable, and a roomy tonneau,
and possesses the advantage of an abso
lute loss of that vibration so noticeable
in other cylinder cars. . In fact, for ac
tual reliability, attractive style and
economy of . maintenance the "Ford
Model F" is preferred -by> many to any
other cylinder car made.' ; It Is designed
for automobile users who want a prac
tical touring car at a price that renders
such a vehicle a profitable investment
rather-than an expensive luxury. .\u25a0- Such
a donation was a very splendid 'gift to
one of California's noblest - r -" charities.'
The Directory Intends to hold a festival
this fall to add to its finances.

VAST PLACERS OF TIN
ON ALASKAN COAST

T7ERIHCATION by Government experts of the reports of im-
V mensely rich beds of tin-bearing grravel' in the Cape York
region on the coast of Alaska has attracted the interest and atten-
tion of local and foreign capitalists, who are led to believe that in
. the near future these mines in American territory will be among
the world's largest sources of supply of this valuable mineral.
YESTERDAY MORMNG. THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL PUBLISHED AN
EXTENDED ARTICLE CONTAINING THE . LATEST REPORTS ON THE- TIN
DEPOSITS IX ALASKA, THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF EXTRACT FROM
SAME. â¢ '\u25a0
Since the discovery of tin ore by gold
prospectors In 1900 Investigations have
been conducted looking to the probable
. value of the deposits, and from time to
time reports .more or less flattering
â¢ have been received. Recently, howevei.
the verification by Government experts
Of the most flattering: reports regarding
these deposits have attracted wide at-
tention, and the promise of the world's
euply of tin Is something which from
present appearances is probable of ful-
fillment.
The best authentic Information about
\u25a0 the Alaskan tin discoveries is found In
the reports of United States Government
experts, who do not hesitate to say that
the new field will probably be .found
â¢upon development to rival In extent and
richness the world-famous mines of the
Straits Settlements, Cornwall and Aus-
. trails.
EXPERT MAKES A REPORT.
. The following Is a brief extract from
these reports:
" "The tin deposits are on creeks and ;
streams whose waters flow into Lopp
\u25a0 Lagoon, a shallow arm or inlet of the
" Arctic Ocean, located some six or seven
\u25a0 miles northeast of Cape Prince of
. ""'Wales.also about fifteen miles south of
Cape York, on Bering Sea, and about
â¢ f.orty miles from Teller, which is the lo-
â¢ cation of the district recording ofiice.
. "The creeks upon which tin has been
-discovered in large Quantities are Oak-
land. Tin, Dlomede. Midas, Red Fox,
' Washington, Nebraska, Mama and Buck,
. which now into Lopp Lagoon and have
' ihelr source in a range of hills known
as Potato Mountain, with an elevation
' of about 1200 feet above sea line, with a
. sjtream slope of about 200 feet per mile
â¢ .'to tidewater. â¢ -
' "Generally speaking, the country is
lacking In topographical features wor-
thy of note. The country has in past
â¢ ages been subject to glacial action.
-Mountains have been worn down until
they are but rounded knolls or sum-
â¢â¢taits, the country rock has been ground
up and deposited in the creek beds and
. low places, and the only vegetation is
Arctic and reindeer mosses and vegeta-
.ble molds.
"The geological work of the United
States Government has so far Blmply
been in, the nature of a reconnaissance
with a quite limited amount of map-
ping and surveys, but the main charac-
. 'tpristics of the placer tin field are easily
6bserved, owing to the erosion due to
.'_the glacial action and the spare vege-
. "-table covering.
. TnV.IX EVEUY PAXPL'U
'-. "In brief, the tin belt is about forty
. miles long and the distribution of tin
r ores (cgissiterite) may be said to extend
Â» quite generally over this area. All of
-thÂ«r streams contain stream tin in quan-
.tUy. soraf, as a matter of course, being
â¢much richer than others, but on the
whole it can be said that there' ls not
anoiher such an undeveloped rich tin
.'ntld knewn in the world to-day. I fully
' concur with the opinion of others who
have oxa.ir.ined and reported upon this
\u25a0â¢.field..
"The creek beds and ravines have
' been filled i:p with detritus from the
.-mountain slopes and stream tin has
been plentifully deposited, and by a
â¢ natural-- method of concentration has
been left in a large percentage, while
the lighter and more easily transportea
.shale and slate, together with gravel
and Sand, have been transported under
â¢ action into Lopp Lagoon.
! "So genernlly is stream tin scattered
that nearly every form of earth or sur-
face soil taken from the hill slopes and
benches of this region discloses its pres-
. enoe. Some of the creek benches are
quite rich and can be worked with
much profit.
'. *"The main deposits of free tin ore are
Jn the stream beds of the creeks men-
tioned. The depths of - the deposits arÂ«>
variable, ranging from ten to thirty j
feet, while there are some that may ex- j
â¢ceed /Ifty feet. In some places there is
a surface soil overlying the gravel de-
â¢ posits from one to three feet deep.
"The percentage of tin ore varies
from ten to forty pounds per cublo
yard. Some who have examined these
deposits estimate as high as sixty-flve
pounds per cubic yard. 1
t DISCOVERED BY ACCIDENT.
"Tin ore was discovered in Alaska In
the summer of 1900 by gold miners who
prospected the various creeks tributary
to Lopp Lagoon, for gold. But, doubt-
Jess, ' stream tin was found- by the
â¢Russian* during 'their occupancy of the
country. After the discovery of tin
practically nothing was done until 1903

developing the tin mining industry. Lo-
cations were made near Tin City and on
Buck Creek. The industry is essentially
a new one to American mining men,
and the average prospector passed tin
by, not knowing what It was or as
something out of the line of what he
went to Alaska for. The discoveries
were made In the territory near Cape
York during the Nome excitement, and
the discovery of tin was quite acciden-
tal. Miners in sluicing for gold had
their sluice-box riffles banked and pack-
ed with the strange and heavy metal,
which waÃ to them quite a serious dif-
ficulty to contend with in their work of
getting gold.
"Asays from samples taken of the
tin ore assayed 52 per cent and as high
as 73 per cent.
_GOLD VALUES ARE HIGH.
"The gold values jn these creeks and
the presence of this metal in amount
sufficient to give special values to these
deposits by reason of its presence
should be given attention, as the assay
value in gold alone of stream tin sam-
ples taken by myself run from $174 to
$640 per ton. â¢ Gold exists- in paying
quantities on the creeks, but it is either
oxidized or covered with a coating,
making It difficult tq distinguish from
the stream tin. It would not be sur-
prising to learn that the tin may be the
by-product in the matter of the values
when the claims are worked close to
bedrock."
That large tin bodies exist in the
York region, Alaska, is confirmed in the
report of the United States Geological
Survey by Arthur J. Collier to the De-
partment of the Interior last year. The
finding of tin in our own country makes
another Important increase in the min-
eral output of the United States when it
is considered that the total amount of
tin consumed In the United States'alone
In 1902-3 was approximately 39,000 tons,
or 43 per cent of the world's output,
with a market price of $24,000,000.
The properties of the Pacific Tin
Mines Company, Inc., are in the district
referred to in the above. Captain Sam-
uel Colclough, the discoverer of tin in
Alaska, is the superintendent of this
company and is now on the ground
working the mines.
PACIFIC TIN MINES COMPANY.
. INCORPORATED. .
The Pacific Tin Mines Company, Inc.,
with a capital stock of 200,000 shares at
$1 each, was organized in December,
1904, ynder the laws of the State of Cal-
ifornia. The corporation was organizea
for the purpose of acquiring the The-
resa and Annie groups of tin deposits,
comprising sixteen claims of twenty
acres each, which property, together
with a valuable water right of 5000
miner's inches, needed in sluicing tin
ore, and a landing afnd warehouse at
Providence. Alaska, to facilitate the
shipping, the company now owns, fully
paid for and unincumbered in any way.
In order to equip the mines with a
large French shovel and the necessary
sluice boxes for handling the enormous
quantity of ore on these claims,. the di-
rectors in March, 1905, authorized the
sale of 25,000 shares of capital stock at
50 cents a share.
This block of stork is finding ready
purchasers, principally among persons
I well acquainted with the properties
owned by this company. The second
block of 25,000 shares will probably be
placed on the market at 11.00 per share
(the par value). After the sale of same.
no more will.be placed on the market.
Samples which were on exhibition at
the St. Louis Fair are to be seen at the
company's offices In San Francisco. -
This company is not endeavoring to
sell stock on the strength of the names
and standing of its directors, we there-
fore avoid publishing their names in
this advertisement. Inquiry at our office
in regard to the directors of this com-
pany will be cheerfully given. Their
I standing in this community will con-
vince a prospective purchaser of our
stock that his investment is an abso-
lutely safe one. â¢
I With this block of stock, this com-
pany presents your last opportunity to
I come In at a nominal price with them
in a proposition with unusually -large
dividends absolutely assured within a T
very 6hort time. You are earnestly re-
quested to make a personal investiga-

PLUCKY IRISH GIRL
ON EXPLORING TRIP
IN THE SOUTH SEAS
YOUNG WOMAN. WHO. UNACCOM
PANIED. IS EXPLORING SOUTH
SEA ISLANDS.
LONDON, July I.â There is a 1a 1 plucky
Irish girl named Beatrice Grimshaw who
is probably J having a higher - average ~? of
adventures per week at present than any
other girl living. Becoming tired of edi
torial work on an Irish cycling paper,
she conceived the 'idea- of setting out,
alone, to roam the South Seas, where
pirates, \ cannibals and leper colonies do
abound. \u25a0
- News has jiist been received from her
indicating that she Is having all . the : ex
citement she hoped for.; She.has:kept as
far as possible out ot the track of the
monthly mail steamships, traveling about
as the sole passenger on irresponsible lit
tle schooners jto islands where- a white
woman never . had : been ' seen | before, and
landing wherever possible for exploration
tours In places where the "fact that Miss
Grimshaw \u25a0 is a 'crack | shot with a rifle
comes in handyâ likewise the further fact
that she is : a champion" swimmer.
In a letter written : from the Fiji Islands
on April 21, and received only yesterday,
Miss Grimshaw says: VÂ» \u0084 : ,
"I have managed to make a trip right
through the interior of one of the two
Fiji Islands, and am starting for the sec
ond now. I have been living jfor weeks
In native villages, fifty, miles' from the
nearest whites, j I took.the trip alone ex
cept for my Fijian carriers. There are no
roaus in these wilds and 'you can barely
get a horse through. -' I mean- to make a
book out of Fiji eventually.-: It- will; be
well: worth It. I intend taking the New
Hebrides and Solomons next."^ , \u0084-j^.
The captain of the schooner Coun
tess, known to every \ mariner : In '"the
South Pacific as the maddest little dare-:
devil in that part : of . the world," is; au
thority for â¢â¢ the' observation that Miss
Grimshaw' Is the g pluckiest woman-: he ]
ever met. That was. after, a cruise- In
which he ran his ship into danger so
often that he lost his certificateâ a cruise
on which this adventurous Irish girl was
the sole passenger. ;\r v : ! '
Miss 'Grimshaw .writes that she has had
an amusing reception In one place where
the native women had never seen a white :
woman before: They insisted on touch
ing her .to j make 'sure she was real ; but
their hearts were'jwon Instantly when the
visitor showed them how she did up her
hair. As their costumes consisted "j of
nothing to speak of they were less inter
ested in the latest styles in dressmaking.
" r'The life of : these people," she t says,
"has a peculiar charm^ There is no rush
ing to catch trains or mails. If you can't
finish anything to-day, there are to-mor
row and a hundred . to-morrows. ': Why
should you hurry? Time moves leisure
ly, and ' it is easier to . walk than to run.;
Food Is cheap. ; The fashions have a com
fortable permanence; and existence .is
free from care." : . . . :' \u25a0 " v

LONDON, July I."â ls Alfred Capusâ â¢
that ;; luckiest of - modern French jj play^
wrights â on the eve of getting popular
in'^English? - : It '\u25a0 looks raÂ£her ; like l-4 it."
Up Ho.; now,'-, it. \u25a0; is true, :.; most- attempts
to 1 "adapt" M. Capus " have had Jbut iri
dlfferent" results. "Neither the* Eng-;
lish version of "La Chatelaine,* nor. that
produced 1 in the United' States proved a
great - ' money-getter -and V-; the trans
planted ;"Two Schools", enjoyed only-a ;
short run. v U . ' ' w^
There: is no* doubt, however,;; about
the success just scored by George Alex
ander with the' translation,' not adapta
tion, of the French author's-VAdver
saire"âcalled lin | English "The Man ?of
, the Moment." i Meanwhile other promt?"
bent actor-managers are getting \ready
to' try their, luck with 'plays by* Capus.
Harry Melville, "who translated l"L* Ad-:
.versaire" for 1 Alexander,' is putting "La :
Bourse ou; la -Vie" into English; â¢ for^
Cyrir Maude, and !an Anglo-Saxon ; ver-;
sion of "Piegois" is being made for;E. J
S. Willard who"; In tends to ; try it first
in America: Both of these Capus plays
were big successes in Paris, particular-;
ly the latter, which ia, the -story; of >a'
nobleman's marriage 'with ; a ; woman
whose great, wealth does "not'-make: up
for the fact that she is far belowihim
in the social scale. .There is talk,- too,
of an English; version. of Capus' "Notre
Jeunesse," in which Coquelln 1 - has been
appearing at- the London- Shaftesbury/
The. London production ofi.'.'L'Adver
saire," or "The ; Man of i the ! Momen t, ',
had an interest apart from the play,
\u25a0 itself-^-this; being the appearance jvith
Alexander of Madame Slmone Le Bargy,'
whom .the manager;*6f: the; St:;" James
recently,, succeeded in; persuading* to
cross the channel and to act in English;
This was made possible by. the fact that
the famous .star of the "Gymriase'*, has
for several ; : years been fairly ' pro
ficient in the use ! of our tongue. % She
came bravely through the ordeal of ap
pearing before an English audience and
I gave a fine performance. , - \u25a0 /
HANDLED WITH \u25a0 GREAT SKILL.
"The Man of the Moment," however,
did not ' have jj to : depend on Madame Le
Bargy for -its success. * It is: a* power
ful play, In which a conventional ; theme
Is handled with great skill. 'Maurice
Darlay,. a lawyer,; is a rising man, who
has noVgreat inclination to rise; his
wife, however, is ambitious 5 : for: his
sake and would like to ; see him distln-^
guish himself. /He has , made, a ;mark
in a much talked of case, but since then
has been content to rest oh his laurels.
He is offered another, opportunity, 1 *a ;
case in which i he ; is asked to defend a ;
politician accused of fraud. He refuses
to , take up * the?" case and j recommends
another young rising man, who accepts
the brief,; secures;; an and
makes a great name by the; affair.' \u25a0 .
* It is the (irony 'of fate <-that Madame
Darlay : should -4 become \u25a0". ; infatuated \u25a0 ; with
the ; new "Man i of â¢ the Moment." > Finally
her husband suspects and , determines to
cross-examine his wife. With Uhis inter
rogation \u25a0\u25a0 the third act, the -big act of ithe
play, f openÃ. g The lawyer Suites " the j hand
of steei in the glove of ; velvet so success
fully that finally the woman â¢ breaks down
completely, and confesses g everything.'
She pleads for forgiveness, but 'receives,
little, encouragement. ,. Her^husband is
bent <on ; a separation. , There :i3 just a
chance- of his- relenting.'; however, /when
his wife's mother, Madame Grecourt, ap
pears on the scene, f and, " through en
deavoring Ito "'mend ; matters, -seals her
daughter's ; fate. ' Madame .Grecourt has
partially,; divined the situation,'; but sup-^
poses ; it is the. man who ; - has ' proved un-;
faithful/tSo^she \urges iher^ daughter to
forgive,' observing that , men'; and \ women
are- not to;be judged by the /same code.'
Vlf ' it were you; now, 'who ..had : sinned,'.',
she says to her daughter, ."there could be
no : forgiveness' V The only course for such

Irrigation Expert at Uni
versity Describes Eesults
of .Recent Experiments
EVAPORATION STUDIED
Many Points About Wetting
of Soil Are Treated in
a Bulletin Just Issued
BERKELEr, July l.^The work of
the irrigation department of the Agri
cultural College for the year 1805 is the
subject of a lengthy bulletin written
by Professor Samuel Fortier and print
ed by the Department of Agriculture
at Washington that was- received to
day.
According to Professor Fortier the
Irrigation work which Is of most In
terest and importance is that to de
termine the effects of evaporation on
surface land, shallow furrows and deep
furrows. Experiments have been con
ducted at the Pomona station, where
soil from various parts of Southern
.California were treated by the various
methods used by farmers In their irri
gating, the result going to prove that
surface flooding is moat wasteful and
that deep furrows conserve much more
water than do shallow furrows.
Experiments have been carried on at
Berkeley to determine the effect of
temperature on the rate of evaporation.
The amount of evaporation was shown
to be largely dependent on the temper
ature of the water. -
The oÂ»*ect of water on cereals in
well-worn soils of the San Joaquln
Valley has been tried. The applica
tion of sixteen inches of water in
creased the yield of barley from nine
to twenty-two bushels per acre. In
a wheat field that produced only straw,
four inches of water produced a yield
of ten bushels p"er acre, and sixteen
inches of water increased the yield to
thirty-eight bushels.
An investigation Into the value of
irrigation in fruit orchards showed
that the quantity of fruit increased
where irrigation was practiced and that
the quality was superior.-' Hundreds
of growers contributed testimony to
this effect. Alleged injuries to fruits
and vines by irrigation was found to
be due to errors in irrigation and not
to irrigation itself.
One of the most important branches
of work planned by the irrigation staff
at the university Is declared by Pro
fessor Fortier to be now under way
in Southern- California, where Dr.
Loughridge is conducting a series of
experiments in the orange groves to
demonstrate what are the relative
merits of shallow and. deep furrows;
how much more water Is evaporated
from a wet than a dry soil; what
amount of water will produce the best
results and when it should be applied.
Field experiments In irrigating wheat
near Modesto, by. each of the three
standard methods, viz., checks, fur
rows and flooding from field laterals,
are being made. A continuation of; the
Investigations of pumping plants, to
determine how their efficiency may be
increased and their, cost decreased, is
in progress.

LONDON, July 11â At' the Cabmen's
Union for some time to come there -.will
be little, talked about but the .luck : that
befell "one of their' number recently.
Plying for fares in" Pall Mall late one
night he was hailed by the Duke of
Marlborough, who had just /emerged
from the Marlborough Club, and drove
him home. He was well paid for. the
job and as the hour was late he .con
cluded that he; would knock off for the
night. On overhauling the cab after
putting up the horse, he discovered - a
pair of lady's gloves neatly , rolled up.
When he opened '\u25a0 them out dropped a
diamond ring. - \u25a0..' â¢ â¢ ; :'
â¢ He was certain that the gloves were
not in the cab when he 1 picked up the
Duke. '-. Therefore they must nave, been
left there by his Grace. .JBut the ] fact
that they were ladles' gloves and that
the ring had obviously adorned "some
feminine hand suggested, to him that
in restoring? them it. would be well .for
him to exercise some discretion: j.'Of
course they might belong. to the Duch-.
ess. In' that event if he took them, to
Sunderland House he might reasonably
expect that the Duchess" would- display
her gratitude, in a substantial Amer
ican fashion. > But ,if they didn't be
long to the Duchessâand the Insight
he had . gained as a night cabby v into
some phases of high life- made' him feel
somewhat skeptical on I that , . point

might lead to family ructionsrand his
only \u25a0 reward- might be-: the "knowledge
that he had acted the honest part.
He concluded therefore that the
safest course-he could adopt -would be
to hand them to the Duke personally.
The Duke is Under-Secretary for the
Colonies and the â¢discreet and honest
cabby found him at the Colonial Office.
The Duke showed no embarrassment.
He thanked the cabman' profusely.' â¢ As
the things belonged to the* Duchess and
she prized T the ring- highly, -he said
he would leave it to her to determine
what his reward should be. The Duke
took his address and the man started
to go after making a profound obeis
ance. . . . :: - '. \u25a0/;,"-\u25a0 \u25a0;,'-\u25a0\u25a0 â¢:\u25a0
"By the way,*'- said the Duke, "why
did you bring the property to me here
instead of taking them to Sunderlana
House?" - .
"Shure, your Grace," answered cab
by, who had "not ' been born'in the
Emerald Isle 'for nothing, "because^ I
didn't want to be troubling her Grace
with trifles,' an' I knew , I should' find
your Grace here, f or/VlS'e read \ln the
papers it's early an' late you're always
a-workin* . for your country." "
-,Next day he received f rom ' the
Duchess a. letter or thanks "and/ two
:crisp Â£10 ($5O) notes. V The t>uke ap
pointed" h.im his official./ ."cabby" ': to"
drive him from.'place to place at' stated
hours. '.And the .Duchess, on": learning
that he was .not one of the,. fortunate
ones . w:ho" 'owned his lown, Ojftflt, sent
him, through the .Duke, a promise that
she would j contribute' , two-thirds ; the
cost of a cab andhorse if,;at the end
of twelve months, he, had proved him
self sufficiently thrifty, and industrious
to have saved up the other. third of the
required amount. , \u25a0 â¢
"I wouldn't now-be on. the .high. road

RENO, July I.â No lusty limbed gladia

men, trained to the hour, upon the eve

yesterday morning fresh from his four
weeks of training near Ogden and a select
few saw him at his gymnastic work at
Wheelmen's Hall in the afternoon. The
Chicago man is fast. He is strong and
a punch that -worked on the- punching
bag looks fully, as effective as any de
livered !by his opponent from the blue
grass State. -.
Root is lighter by twenty pounds | than
Hart, v but what he lacks in weight he
certainly makes up in speed. He. strips

NEW: YORK. July I.â Philadelphia took
both games ' of the double-header from New
York to-day. In . the first \u25a0 game the visitors
shut out the home team, owing to Coakley'a
good pitching. . It required eleven Innings for
ounce of superfluous flesh upon his agile
frame. He is, truly speaking, trained to a
fine point.
His foot work is great and he is as
quick, as a cat and one has but to see
him to appreciate the perfection to which
the body of man may be brought. Root
is fifteen Inches larger around the chest
than he is about the waist.
"When Root arrived, Marvin Hart sent
word to him that he was perfectly wel
come to the use of the gymnasium dur
ing the hours which had been set aside
for his. training programme. The Chicago
man, glad of the opportunity after 1 his
twenty-four hour ride on tha train to
get out and limber up his muscles, spent
two hours at hard work during the after
noon. He then went to the hotel, where
he renewed acquaintances with Jeffries
and a number of ring followers who are
â¢in the city.
j The big Kcntucklan has completed his
preparations for the fight. Hart's eye is
bright and his- skin is clear as exercise
'could make it. During the last five days,
he has developed a great deal of speed.
Particular attention has been paid to the
boxing feature of his programme. Trainer
McCormlck stated yesterday that he ex
pected Hart would win the fight within a
few rounds, as he is in shape to set a
whirlwind pace. ...

Tennis Tournament Opens on
the -San Eafael Courts
With Some Close Matches
The flftn annual tennis tournament
for- the men's championship of th*
State was commenced on thÂ© Hotel Ra
fael courts at San Rafael yesterday.
The heat was more Intense than on tha
previous day. but the players were not
distressed to any great extent. Of tha'
twenty-six entrants but eight remained
undefeated when play was called lata
in the afternoon. Those who survived
the day's play are B. F. Nourse, Carl
Gardner, Percy Murdock, Fred Adams.
George Janes. Harry Rolfe. Gaorg*
Busch and Richworth Nicholson.
ThÂ© contestants, as a rule, wera aven
ly enough matched to make tha games
Interesting. No surprises were sprung,
the successful players being those
picked to reach the third round.
The best tennis of the day waÂ» tha
match between Percy Murdock and
Herbert-Schmidt. They met in tho first
round, after Schmidt had disposed of
Herbert Long easily and Murdock had
received a default from Parr. Schmidt
played great tennis in tha opening set,
and Murdock at one time looked to be
up against it The former killed from
all parts of the court to the early
part of the set, and had a good lead
of 4-2 and 30-16. Murdock fought des
perately and took th* next threa
games.
Schmidt evened up the score In tha
tenth game, and took the eleventh, giv
ing him a leaet of 6-5. From this point
on it was nip and tuck, Murdock final
ly winning. by a score of 9T7.9 T 7. Murdock
improved in- the second set. whlla
Schmidt fell off a trifle In his play.
Murdock won the set easily by a scora
of Â«-2.
Richworth Nicholson, who. about
eight years ago, ranked next to thÂ«
Hardys and George "Whitney, played
the most brilliant tennis of the . day.
He used a terrific serve, and did tome
clever back and fore hand driving. Ha
was anything but steady, bat managed
to take two sets out of three front
Nelson Alexander.
Gardner, although successful In both
his matches, did not make a good im
pression. He probably was saving him
self, and did not exert himself except
when he had to. He won the first nlnÂ«
games from Drolla and then lost the
next five. The latter won the second
set. but Gardner outclassed him In the
third.
Danner and Henry played the longest
and closest match of the day. All their
sets went to* deuce, the last two of
which Danner annexed..
Fred Adams, like Gardner, took
matters easy, and pulled out when tha
pinch came. v \
George Janes was in excellent form,
and played fast tennis in both of his
matches. He beat Gabriel In straight
sets, and next took McLaugblln. tha
junior champion. Into camp. ';-..'
Play will be resumed on Monday,
when the tournament will be completed
to the finals. Some Interesting matches
will be played 10-morrow, as the ' re
maining eight players are all . evenly
matched. The contestants will opposâ¢
each other as follows: Nourse I vs.
Gardner, Murdock vs. Adams, Janes vj.

GOOD COURSING
AT INGLESIDE
..'An unusually large Saturday- crowd
witnessed the coursing at Ingleside
Park yesterday and was well paid for
Its trip, as. the sport was of the high
est order. .:The : hares were strong and
gave the* gre~yHounds "â¢ sftmei good -tests.
It was, however, a poor day for the
talent, as they erred frequently in their
Judgment and in some instances they
laid. 4 and 5 to 1 against dogs that won
which should have been legitimate fa
vorites.- \u25a0\u25a0- ' -. .-' \u25a0'\u25a0' \u25a0 '
Especially was this true in the course
where the bettors laid 1 to 5 that Lady
Fairfax would raise the flag* over Wild
Belle. The short end showed the- way
to the â¢hare and outworked her. op
ponent, scoring. a hollow victory. Some
other heavy reverses were the defeats
of Idlewise by Arthur S at -4 to 1; Sunny
Shore by Eva G at 3 to 1; Bright Pearl
by' Black Lady at- 3- to 1 and, many
others at smaller odds. Following are

Professor Goebel. AVislies Ac
cess to Documents at

The board of trustees of the Leland
Stanford Jr. University were scheduled
to meet yesterday, but as a quorum was
not obtained the meeting "was post
poned to July 7 and will be held in the
Union Trust building. .- \u0084
Professor Julius C. Goebel,\who was
recently released from the service of
the university, made a written demand
for access to the documents relating
to .the charges preferred against him.
Prof essor i Goebel asserts In'hls'.com
munication thut the charges against
him were kept secret, and although
he was not furnished, with a copy, an
authorized statement of the case was
furnished the press and proved to be
damaging. in its character.
Professor Goebel says that it is for
the purpose of vindication for what he
calls an unwarranted and unnecessary
public attack made upon him by uni
versity employes. He also maintains
that the documents will show that the
charges were inspired ' through self
seeking motives. Professor Gocbel will
appear before, the board at its next
meeting. r

Chase was troubled with' heart disease
; and could not come. A clerk from the
office of General Dickinson also called
upon Ward and said Mrs. Chase was
sick, "but might be able to call at the
Hall of Justice-in a day or two.
' Mrs. Chase did not call and yesterday
morning Misa Merigan waited ; upon
Ward and .' Insisted upon . the warrant

NKWHUHT, N. H., July I.â The body of
Secretary of Stats John Hay, whose un

sorrow uiroughout the land and evoked
' expressions of sympathy and regret the
..world, over, lies to-night In a room of.
"The Fells," "which quaint gambrel roofed
mansion for four^en years has been the
euaamer home of the Hay family.
Just one week ago to-night the Secre
, t&ry arrived at this village from Wash
ington, wearied with the cares of state
: . and anticipating "a long summer's rest."
To-night the same launch In which Mr.
Hay made the short trip from Netrbury
to the landing at "The Fells" conveyed
relatives of Mr. Hay to the home, where
they brought sympathy aud help to the
â¢ stricken woman and her only son. In that
.week came first tbe news that the Secre
tary he.d been seized with a sudden 'and
alarming attack, calling for expert medi
cal treatment; then that he had passed
. thrpugh'the early stages of recovery and
reached a- condition . promising in every
respect* -ultimate recovery. - Then- the
'-crushing blow fell. At "The Fells" there
â¢ss 'deep grief nnd throughout the nation
iho:e is sadness, and regret at the loss
of* one of her greatest statesmen.
' It was the m'udie of the forenoon be
: fjjrÂ«V there was any evidence at "The
\u25a0 l-'cHs" that the prostration caused by the
.?s"j<l<3en and terrible experience was abat
i;lg. It v.-as then that Clarence Hay and
the attending physician issued a state
ment revifwirg the last illness and cir
'CÂ»nistaiicos attending the death. The
â¢ tmly m^m'ireri' of the Secretary's family
at "The Kel!s=" when the end came were
-Mr?. Hay ant Clarence. Mrs.' J. A. WailÂ«i
tvorth of Oene?ee, K. V.. a daughter. luit"
,bt>ifn ill recently and had not- been at
Lake Sunapee this season. Mrs. Payne

way to Europe.
TIXERAL ARRANGEMENTS.
The biiof announcement was made in
the forenoon . that the body probably
would 'be talcrn to Cleveland on Sunday
i r.;id tile request was issued that the
family be prrmitted to remain in uninter
rupted quiet until late 'in the, afternoon
vhen details of the fune?al plans would
by announced. Those -wishes were s=trict-
Jy observed.
Only the undertakers and the messenÂ» %
'pt-rs carrying telegrams- of condolence
tr*rjcrr:d the ground until toward even
y.-p. when Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Mather
arrived from Gloucester. Mass. Mrs.
Mather is a sisux of Mrs. Hay.
1 From *ar]y forenoon until late to-night
th.^ arrival of messages was almost con
tiauous.. They came from all parts of the
..world, b*:t. in arcordance with the wishes
cf.-Mrs. "Hay the nam^s of the senders and

DEATH CAME SUDDENLY.
t # With ilv '^nijouncrment of the funeral

<^jiiji wsf daggering. 'At. the hour.'of, 12
*Â«riday nicbtall was quiet. : In another
nfo:nen t nurses \ and physicians found
thc!n.scivÂ« ; s summoned to; 1 the bedside;
ffhere had been a collapse. Twenty-flve
minute? inter ail was over. So swift'had
tbe <:3d come thÂ»t tho djing man passed
away unattended, by any of the -members
of his family save his wife. The i'son,
Clarence, was summoned, but reached the
be.lskfe to find his distinguished father
cK.t?.
The patient had bidden his "wife and
physicians ge^od night at:iO;o'cleÂ»ckllast
Â»*ssht. An hour later \u25a0 ; he was sleeping
Â«'v:Â«ptly. Almost at the stroke of 12 the
Secretary " was seized with a \u25a0 turn: -He
-v -JU-d fe^ljly and a nurse responded. The
!^*k man was breathing with great diffi
ou7ij-.. Dr. Scudder .'was speedily sum-:
tnoned and it required but a glance for
hini to determine that the end was but
a lew minutes /away. The household was
aroused and the wife reached her hus
band as he was breathing his last. Mrs.
James A. ' Wadsworth was at her home
in Geneseo, L. I.
PATIENT DID NOT SUFFER.
The patient did not suffer greatly In
his last moments. Aside from great
difficulty in breathing, there .was no
struggle. Secretary Kay lapsed into
unconsciousness and seemed to fall
asleep at last. The consternation of the
household was complete." and It re
mained for Dr. Scudder to assume
charge of affairs. After two hours the
I physician wÂ»s" driven to * the village,
where half a <lozei# telegrams were sent.
I The first went to President Roosevelt
jat Oyster Bay. The second was ad
j dressed to the State Department at
j Washington. The others were sent to
friends of tho family. Dr. Scudder
then returned to The Fells.
At 4 o'clock this morning the house
was closed and it was announced that
mo one could be seen untii after 9
I o'clock this morning.
| The bulletin .announcing the i death
read as follows^ " . __1 \ ' '_.. ' , j

board to his cabin. Wireless telegraphic
advices from the ship at sea told of im
provement in his condition and in Italy
the Secretary was so much better after
a rest he was able to, journey quietly to
various cities, finally going to Bad Nau
heim, where he took the baths. . Later
Secretary Hay visited Paris and then
passed to Great Britain, where he was
accorded the same distinguished, though
unofficial, reception that marked - his
days in Paris. All this time Mr. Hay
seemed to be improving. The return from
Europe was made about a fortnight ago.
Secretary Hay has visited hi 3 daughter's
residence at Bayside, L. 1., and a few
days later he went : to Washington to
take up for a brief period his" duties as
Secretary of State.
Last Saturday evening he arrived at
his summer home here, accompanied by
: his son, Clarence. Mrs. Hay had pre
ceded him. The journey fatigued the
Secretary, however, and furthermore,'
while traveling he contracted a : slight
cold. * When Mr. Hay suddenly collapsed
o.i the afternoon of the -following day,
his wife and son became greatly alarmed,
for the Secretary wemed to remain in a
dazed condition â¢ and not to respond to
their efforts to revive him. A, local prac
titioner, .Dr. J. L. Cain of Newport, was
immediately summoned. .
-As an another precaution. . Mrs. Hay ;
summoned by telegraph from Boston Dr.
Charles L. Scudder and Dr. Fred . T.
Murphy, surgeons on the staff, of the
Massachusetts General Hospital. .A
sjjecial : train was chartered,, the tracks ol
the. Boston and Maine railroad were
cleared and the physicians came to New
bury in almost record time. , At midnight
they passed over Lake Sunapelf insaH
.launch and "arrived at "The Fells" ;i to find j
Secretary Hay stronger but. still "gravely
ill. At first an operation was determined
upon. The Illness was at first pronounced
uraemia resulting from the''' severe' 1 cold
which Mr. Hay had contracted and which
was believed to " have been caused by
his Bomewhat hurried visits to -different'
climates. y'ilSgÃfSÃÃSm

OYSTER BAY HEARS
NEWS OF DEATH.
President Roosevelt Shocked
King Edward Is the First Foreign Ruler
to Send Messageof Sympathy
to Nation's Execntiye.
OYSTER BAY, L. I.^July I.âPresi
dent Roosevelt was shocked and
grieved Inexpressibly at the death of
Secretary of State John <, Hay. ' The
news was conveyed- to him. early this
morning:. The President received the
information as almost inconceivable,^as
the last word he had received was that
the Secretary was improving rapidly
and wjis out of danger. ,
\u25a0 When the President was in Cam
bridge, Mass., on. Wednesday he had
a consultation with Dr. Jackson, of
Boston, who had been summoned to the
bedside of Secretary Hay "at the in
cipioncy of his illness. ' .'. Assurances^
were given by Dr. Jackson that Awhile
the Secretary had been a- very sick
man, he then was, evidently' on the
road to recovery. Dr.. Jackson said
that the consulting physicians j agreed
with him in the expression of this
opinion. President Roosevelt/thought
when. Secretary : Hay went abroad :in
the spring that he might not be able
again to actively resume his onerous
duties and responsibilities as Secretary
of State, but when Mr. Hay returned, to
Washington his condition .was so
greatly, improved ; tliat both he and the ,
President hoped that with a summer's
rest at Lake Sunapee' he might* be able ;
for a time at least- to continue the.di-.j
! rection of the State Department:
Warm friexd of* presidext."
I , The death of Secretary Hay, so: en
tirely unexDected, came, as ;a personal
bereavement to the 'President/- With
him tire President was on terms, of . the.
warmest r personal friendship, i The .Sec-,
relary's home was one place in Wash
ington, which President Roosevelt vis
ited with frequency." Indeed, it was a
habit^with the President "while return-,
ing to T the White House 1 from' church'
on Sunday to stop at the residence of
Secretary' Hay for an- informal talk
about matters ofmutualjnterest. Their
convernations on ] such occasions were
not confined by- any means to govern-*
mental' affairs, but covered a wide
rang"fc of topic?.^especially tho^se per
taining to literature and the arts and
sciences. ... ; '. -
Secretary Hay was a. warm friend, of
President Roosevelt's father,; and he,
therefore, had knownUhe President since
the latter's childhood. They had many
tastes and desires â¢ in common and -the
ties which bound them; to each other
wore those' of deep respect and sincere
affection. ' ?... ... :,''. â¢
Immediately on the receipt of the
news of Secretary Hay's - death Presi
dent Roosevelt, indited a message ;to
Mrs. Hay expressive jn a measure of
his profound sorrow at her .bereavement..
This message was as follows: .
â¢ "Mrs. John Hay, Lake i Sunapee: I

.â¢'Everything is favorable.'V
PHYSICIANS FEI.T HOPEFUL.
Thursday's reports "indicated^ continued
satisfactory progress and ; Dr. Murphy,
who had been ; with the 3 patient without
intermission, expressed 'confidence " that
Secretary Hay would be "able = to; sit; up
by Saturday and to go out of doors the
first of ; the week. An J incident iof : yes
terday brought out more r clearly than
anything which- had developed' previously*;
the : exact nature of ; the \ attack which ; he
had experienced. During the, day the Sec- i

to the traditions of his kind, the man
dropped the trunk on the. threshold of
the 'Brown stateroom most uhgently.
There followed an explosion and asthe

contents of four bottles of champagne
had been liberated in. the trunk, to. the

â¢â¢I*s the western counties, and a heavy alfalfa
crtts In the irrigated valleys. There is a fine
outlook for hope in the Yakiraa Valley, but
.-In western districts they have not armed out
well.* Pastures are good and potatoes, peas
and rarden vegetables are very thrifty.
â¢\ Oats Rive promi-F-e of a heavy crop. Barley

Jtles. Spring wheat Is doing finely in general,
â¢- although met !s reported as harlng appeared
.la some localities. Winter wheat is filling
â¢ S-Fejl,* but has grown very rank and is liable
to lodge. Some Is already lodfred by rain and
jrlnd.* altogether the prospects for & large

The Hay Market.
Â«*" The circular of Scott & Magner says of Hay:
" "Arrivals of Hay for the week have been
2563 tons, which is a little In excess of the
previous week's receipts.
â¢ "There has been plenty arriving to more
than supply the current demand.
"Export shipments have been particularly
'llsjrht, and there has nothing recently devel
oped to cause an expectation of any activity
In tbat direction.
"General trade has continued a little quiet
throughout, with no -special features of note.
There Is usually a slight lull In business at
tMs season, as many delay matters until after
the Fourth. -^
\u25a0"Some moderate purchasing of No. 1 lots
"ha* been done. In Contra Costa County mainly,
-while a few lots also have changed hands in
Sttae Holllster end Livenaore districts. With
these exceptions no marked activity has devel
oped as yet. It 1s still an open question to us
ell ac to what we may expect for our summer
' market.
Â» "While occasional 'cars cf Fancy Wheat Hay
have commanded up to $14 per ton, the bulk
. of the Wheat H*y arriving Is freely offered at
\u25a0from $9 50 to $11 CO. Choice Tame Oat Hay.
being in light supply, sells readily at $11 to
â¢$1160.' The bulk of all the arrivals has con
tinued to be of the medium and poorer grades.
This. clas* of Hay continues to move elowly at
low prices, and nothing in the situation war
racis the expectation cf anything better for the
â¢.ni-er future.
â¢"Brerai cargoes of good second cutting Al
* falfa have come In of late, on which the ask
kig; price has been from $9 to *9tÂ« per ton.
X few cars of poorer Alfalfa have sold at
fc-bout IT per ton.
' . â¢ t Tbe Straw market has remained unchanged
and. Cull throughout. Arrivals are decidedly
light and the demand Is equally bo. The mar
ket here Is weak, and lower figures are ex
pected, for nÂ«w Straw will soon appear."
. Cotton, Coffee and Copper.
, T3iÂ« New York wires of E. F. Hutton & Co.
yeeterday said:
COTTON â It looKs to -us as though the mar
kets arÂ« now being carried up through the
force of a runaway bull speculation â¢ urged on
by the advancing operations 01' large local and
New Orleans speculative interests, with .the
public coming* in under the stimulus of a craze
forced by the came tactics employed during the
Sully campaign. The enormous extent to
which spot dealer* and exporters oversold
themselves In making contracts to supply spin
uers throughout New England and in Europe
\u25a0with" cotton, and the heavy investments which
the spinning- Interests made in the new crop
â¢ operations, when they were telling around 7c
as a protection against the possibility of ust
such a crop scare ts has recently developed,
b&ve .contributed to the sensational trading and
violent advance of the week. What will be the
outcome no one can now nafely say. The bull
leaders appear to have the markets In their
control *et -- the moment and they are con
fidently predicting lie for cotton In the not
distant future. If .prlc-e are forced ud much
further and the weather conditions in the belt
continue favorable we might nee a collapse of
the speculation pyramids which the present
manipulators of, the market are now building
on their paper -profits. r
COFFEEâ Durtnc the past week the coffee
market has be*n eupported by prominent inter
ests which have been tor some time attached
to the long elde. TMs â¢ was Uie principal
reason for the steadiness the market has
cbown. The F'.tuaiicn and outlook are Kill
uncertain. They depend largely on further
definite crop news and the prospective move
ment.
COPPER â Boston. Mass.. July 1. â The de
mand for AUcuez still continues and the stock
â¢old at 2C%c to-day, a record high price. The
rest of the market was very quiet, with no
changes In quotations. Mchawk and Osc-eola
tre being steadily accumulated, around these
pric-*>s. and a few *cattÂ«>re<S order* In Tamarack

able to ' bears. . Heavy ram "in: the Southwest
further delayed harvesting. In addition an of
ficial/ forecast predicted widespread showers
for. to : morrow both the spring ani
fall sown wheat \u25a0 sections'. ' Another bullish : In
fluence was an. advance In the price, of wheat
at Liverpool. Later the mar-set gained strength
from an exceedingly bullish report by a Minne
apolis crop expert, estimating the total crop
in Minneapolis and the Dakotas at 1(53,000,000
bushels. ..The demand became so : aggressive as
to force July to 04% c and September to 90%0.
During the last fifteen minutes the market
waa subjected to general liquidation, which
waa started by a break in prices at Minneapo
lis. Many traders here were anxious to real
ize profits, the exchange being closed for the
next three days. Final quotations were 92% c
for July and 88% c for September. .\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0 -*- .

The fruit market presented an active appear
ance during the forenoon, there being a tood
inquiry for shipment to coast ports in addition
to the usual extra local Â«"- Â«"d for Sunday
wants. Prices for most descriptions of orchard
fruits ruled . weak; despite â¢ the active trading,
receipts of most kinds being more than suffi
cient for requirements. Figs remained steady
under continued light receipts and Peaches
of the early Crawford and St. John varieties
were firmly held at or close to the outside
quotation, while the Halo's Marly variety was
offering freely at sC@6Oc per box. There was
continued weakness in Apricots. Apples and
Plums, and Pears sold at a wide range as to
variety, ; quality and size of package. The
warm weather stimulated trade in Melons, an 1
as there was no fresh arrivals the market was
pretty well cleaned up at the close. In the
Berry line Huakleberrles, Raspberries and
choice table Blackberries were firmer, while
the other kinds were easy, with the canners
takln" surplus lots of Loganberries and large
Strawberries at the inside I quotations. White
Nectarines from Fresno were offering freely at
KOc per crate, but found few buyers owing to
the greenness of the fruit. C.trus fruits were
firm, with 'stocks of good Oranges extremely
light.
