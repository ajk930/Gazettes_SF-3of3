at two to five million dollars, and. with
half a dozen grown children, to-day

or the groom. 'Â¦ '_' J
Two closed carriages drove hurriedly
to the church and the bride and a few
friends alighted and entered. She was
attended by. her lawyer, George â¢ H.
Hutton. After a rather- long wait the
door suddenly opened and in ; rushed
a young man, who, with nervous stride.
walked up the aisle and took a seat
beside his bride-to-be.
The ceremony finished, Father Hawe
and the attendants extended congrat
ulations. The wedded pair walked
down the aisle, the groom a mute spec
tator to the congratulations offered his
bride. As the. outer, door , was reached
there was a shower of rice, the couple
were . handed into a carriage and

the "free and unlimited coinage of silver at

Pardee spoke of Roosevelt, as an un-
Bafe man for trusts and boodlers, but
a safe man for the people; not an aris
tocrat but a man of the people. He
dwelt at some length upon the life of
Roosevelt and .declared the President
an enemy of the trusts.
The Governor asked all to vote for
McKinlay for Congress in the Second
District and for the Republican nom
inee for the Assembly in this county.
He was several times interrupted by
applause and heartily cheered at the
close of his address.
Webb urged the election of McKin

and argued that as he would be in
entire harmony with the administra

gress he' would be able to render the
greatest measure of service to the dis^
trict and the State.
. Turning to national Issues Webb,dis
cussed at length the Philippine ques
tion and criticized the demand in . the
Democratic \ platform . that the . islands
be surrendered. Continuing he said:
David B. H.M's control and domination of
the St. Louis convention was absolute. The

vailed and Parker was nominated. Â¦. I , do not

Â¦ As a member of the Judiciary Committee cf
Congress I helped frame and helped pass
through the House of Congress the antl-lnjunc

Musicians' Union that the Marine. Band was
going to play at the Pittsburg Exposition I
consented to champion the fight to keep this
band Â¦ from Interfering with the union musi

my district. I succeeded and the Marine Band
did not go to Pittsburg. On behalf .of the
coopers I . Interceded and assisted In defeating
a bill .'that would have taken many dollars
from them. On "behalf of the leather workers
of San Francisco 1 obtained . a contract from
the Government under the terms of which the
shoemakers of this city made 40,000 pairs of
shoes for the army. I obtained an appropria

erection of a new custom-house where the old
postofflce now stands. This will give employ
ment to hundreds of San Francisco workmen
and they will get the most of this vast sum. I
obtained an appropriation * of J1CO.00O for the
construction of a lighthouse on Mile Rock,
and this will benefit many artisans of this city,

NEW YORK. Oct. 26. â The crowd
at the Republican mass meeting in
Carnegie Hall to-niffht was bo large
that the doors were locked at 7:30
o'clock. At that time all the avail
able srace within the hall. was filled,
and several thousand people were
crowded about the entrance seeking?
admission.
John Hay. Secretary of State, who
made the first speech, was given an
ovation when he appeared. The band
played and flags were waved in every
part of the house, while the audience
cheered. ' . .. -
The audience rose as one man. when
the presiding officer characterized
President Roosevelt as a "man whom
all admire and love."
Great cheering greeted Secretary
Hay. Many times while he was speak
ing Mr. Hay was interrupted by ap
plause, and there was a great out^
burst of cheering when he finished.
Former Governor Black also spoke.
Secretary Hay's speech in part fol
lows: ;."-," ."".
This campaign will be memorable In our an
raU as one of th? qu'.etst ever known. Barely
in our recuTlecUon has there been eo little ex
citement, so alight disturbance of the orderly
course of affairs. Why is It that these great
assizes where eighty millions of people are to
decide in whose hands they are -to plarÂ« their
interests for the next four years should be
approached with so Mttlf nclse, with such un
usual calm? Why is it that the American peo
ple are possessing their souls in such repose?
There is, I venture to say, no explanation
of this state or feeling, except that the people
or thin country have made up their minds that
there is to be for the preuent no change in
the principles and policies that have proved eo
s-uccffsful in the last ei^ht years. They bad re
solved definitely and clearly in 18JMJ that their
temporary aberration from the policy which as
Jong ago ae the time of Henry Clay was called
the American system had not resulted favor
ab!y. They intrusted William McKlnley with
Hit task of bringing the country. back to its
old bearings, of restoring the well tried ways
cf the naUcnal housekeeping. He showed hlm
telf wcrtiiy of their confidence. In four years
the country made great progress along Its reg
ular old fashioned lines of healthy develop
ment, and In 1900 when he gave an account of
fc.s Â»t~war.'fhlp the people approved it and
renewed hiÂ« term of office. An unspeakable
enme snatched him away from his glorious
tftsw and our loving confidence. In the classic
tcyth when the golden bough was torn away
another immediately appeared in its place.
Theodore Roosevelt took up the burden our be
lovvd chief laid down and with incomparable
t-ourar* and Etrength has carried It on. With
the work nf both these faithful servant* the ',
Arriericfn people are eatlsQed. Believing and
Intruding that the work shall go on in the
hand* tnd under the guidance which hss been
icur.d eo efficient, they are not wasting so
much time u usual from their private affairs
to show an intencst which Is too universal to
need tr.uih advertising.
CANNOT BE TRUSTKD.
Â¦ The country cannot afford to intrust its
vast domestic Interests to those who denounce
â¢p extravagant and unconstitutional all money
*T*ni for the "general welfare." to promote
â¢fthich was one of the special objects of which
the constitution was brought into being. Do
*re want Vi give our gallant little army to the
care of those who think :it uught to be dis
banded, or our navy â which, under this ad
ministration.- lias carried our flag into so many
distant Â«-Â»b. sever on a wanton errand of hos
tility, but always as tfce friend of American
commerce and the protector of our citizens â
<3(Â» we want it handed over to the men who
Â»ay it ought to be thrown to the scrap heap?
Do -we want the Philippines abandoned to be
the victims of misrule at the hands of their
own acit&torc. or the prey of any covetous
power that may wish to enslave them for its
own profit? Do wÂ» want to sneak out of the
Isthmus of Panama, acknowledge we have no
right thert. and bavely surrender the hope and
the- dream cf centuries?
But whatever the platform and the candi
dates may profess it is perfectly clear that the
vart proportion of the party. a> at present
organized, is epposed to the Republican prin
ciples set forth in our platform and avowed
by our candidates. They are opposed to the
fold standard; to protection of American In
dustries; to all our programme, foreign and
dcmeulic: and Oveir candidate. If he should
happen to" be elected, would be confronted
vith chaos at the very outset of his adminis
tration.
He has recently made a speech which would
be a very shut of NÂ«sus to him if he were
Â«ver called en to carry his words Into action
He has, at last come to the point where he is
milling to say we must abandon the Phil
ippines. In his rpe*ch of acceptance he
acknowledged our responsibility for them and
said wÂ« should give them self-government. His
friengi. In great distreu of mind, cried out to
him that that was the Republican doctrine
and that what he Intended to say was that we
had no responsibility Tor them and must give
them Independence. "Certainly, that was what
J meant," said the Judge â and he wrote some
thing like It in bis letter of acceptance But
even that *u not enough, and ten days ago
he revised his views again, and now declares
for the absolute abandonment of the islands
â¢Â».d.fer Â«ii Immediate proclamation of our in
tention to do so. Among the reasons he gives
for thifc reckless and ill-considered utterance
are some which show an incredible carelessness
of the farts.
He began by saving they have cost as $670,-
OOO. 000 ana an *normcus mm to keep them;
some put Jt as high as $50,000,000 annually.
Th^-truthr accessible to him and to everybody.
Is that they have cost not to exceed $189,000.-
OOO. and the annual disbursement on their ac
ocunt is about $5,000,000. He said further that
they fad cost us 200,000 lives, wherein he is
wronB to the extent of ebout 105,000. But
there sÂ«-emÂ« no limit to his eaÂ«er "credulousness.
Rinre he pilt out -these feiry figures he has
b*>fird of Mr. Atkinson and has swallowed
without winking his grotesque estimate that
the islands have cost us 'twelve hundred mil
lions, and that the present expense of- them is
two hundred millions a year. He seems hyp
notized by these vast sums. Why should he
etop at millions and billions? 'We may reason
ably} expect' thai th>~ next' warning cry from
E*opus will 'be shouting- quadrillions . to Â¦ a
startled world. He seems able to believe any
thingâall he asks Is that it shall be tnored-
Ujle. â¢ â¢ - - , .
S PARKER'S IRRraPOXSIBIMTY.
In this speech < the Democratic candidate
faa 8 given the measure of his knowledge of
large affairs, has shown bis lack of any sense
of responsibility, and " has Introduced another
clement of dcubt . and danger Into the prob-
Urns which would confront his administration
if he were elected.
It Is a misfortune for a party, as it Is for
an individual, to have no serious occupation,
for Satan finds mischief for idle bands. Be
cause they have absolutely no facts to bring
forward they have produced a fantastic variety
of fictions. I will not occupy your time by
recounting these rather Ignoble flights of
imagination. I will only refer to one class
of charges â those which ring the changes on
two words; the President Is "lawless" and
'"unsafe."
Every act of his which they qualify as
lawless has been done after careful study of
the law, after counsel with the best lawyers,
and ever}' one which baa been brought to
the test of the courts has been triumphantly
approved by our highest judicial authorities.
But we are told he is dangerous to the
peace of the world, he is a flre eater, ' a
war lord â he wishes to embroil us in a policy
of adventure. What does the record say? He.
and Ms predecessor have done more In the
interest of universal peace than any other
two Presidents since our Government was
formed. They have done more for. the cause
of arbitration than all the rest put together.
Ttiey have composed more difficulties by
friendly negotiation; they have settled more
questions that threatened our peace; they
have made more treaties and more mutually
advantageous ones than any other Presidents
in our history. â¢- ,
It sometimes seems a waste of time to meet
these "wild and whirling words" of calumny.
The men that utter them do not themselves
believe them. Each man of them knows very
well that be could wish no happier lot to his
boy in the cradle than that he might grow up
to be such a man as Theodore Roosevelt. If
some i weak-minded anarchist should take it
into his addled brain to adopt â¢ the amiable
and chivalrous advice given the other day in
a public speech by an Alabama Congressman
and send President Roosevelt to join the equal
ly loved and maligned Lincoln and Garfield
and McTCinley, you know now what a pall of
iwww would spread over this country from
end to end: and not over this country alone.
for the shadow of that grief would sweep like
a sudden night around the world. . '
THE CUUSE OP PARTY SPIRIT.
It Is the curse of party spirit, especially in
times when the opposition has no great cause
t<> advocate, when there is no great Issue at
stake, that impels even honest men to tay
what they do not believe and to Incite dlsor-'
dered minds to dee4a which fill with anguish
the heart of a nation. ' >
1 read a while ago in the platform of the
Democrat* of< Massachusetts this reckless
charge Â¦ against the President: .
"He has declared war against a .Bister repub
lic without an act of* Congress, In defiance of
the well-known usages of international law
and In the face of an adverse opinion from his
chief law adviser. It Is commonly believed."
Who. I may ask, believes It? Who is the
man gifted with the malignant credulity which
makes such belief possible? This is a model
campaign fiction, for every word In it is false.
The President has not declared war on any
nation. A declaration of war is a solemn of
ficial act, impossible except by a vote of Con
press. No such act ever took ' place. It may
be presumed the platform refers to the notice
riven to the hostile forces on the lBthmv that
they were not to fight on the line of the rail
road, which it was our duty to keep open.
But this was no war. and no declaration of
war; there was no defiance of our constitu
tion, nor of International law. The action of
the President was in the Interest of peace and
It was effective. Not a hostile shot has since
been fired on the isthmus.
And here Is the plain proof of It. In the
very same breath with which .ey accuse us
of beirx on the Isthmus as the result of vio
lence, robbery and treachery, .they propose
not only to stay there, but to go right on and
reap the fruit of our Infamy by building the
canal. There Is no talk of restitution, no sug
gestion of a national penance for transgres
sion. Nothing of the kind. They will enter
the house of sin which we have built â they
will eat of the fat and drink of the sweet,
rolling up sanctimonious . eyes and thanking
heaven they are not as those wicked Repub
licans.
LOYAL TO CONSTITUTION.
The Republican* can avow their adherence
to the . Constitution without hypocrisy and
without the labored emphasis of remorse. The
flrÂ«t Kreat work of* the party was performed
in 1861. when with toil and struggle such as
we prey may never be necessary again they
saved the constitution from the . assaults of
the predecessors of the men who now . claim
exclusive charge of it, and who even to-day
not only acquiesce In Its violation In certain
States of the Union, but shamelessly profit by
It.
This extraordinary campaign is drawing to
a close. On the Mh of November the bickering
and confusion of tongues will cease. The peo
ple who have been filling the air with slander
of the man who has so well and so nobly
served the country, will recognise with grati
tude his excellent work," and will be glad they
are still to enjoy the benefits of It. The con
stitution cur great charter of public and pri
vate rlcnts, will be found Intact. The doc
trine of .protection.. given forth by Washing-'
ton and Hamilton, amplified and perfected by
the' experience of a century of trial,* will still
be available to fill our . treasury and to foster
our manufactures. The gold standard of cur
rency and our banking laws in the hands of
thote'wbo established them and who do not
have to protest' the sincerity of their' adher
ence to them will keep our finances firm as the
hills. . ThÂ« principle of national ty, derived
front our * Revolutionary fathers and conse
crated by the blood and toil of the civil ' war,
will guard this Indissoluble Union of Inde
structible states against all atti^k from within
or without. The Atlantic and Vaciflc oceans
will still be equally the field of ftur trade and
commerce. Our possessions beyond the seas
will be governed with firmness and liberality,
with an ever- increasing measure of freedom,
"as they develop the faculty of self-control.- We

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Few Pecpl* Knew How Useful It IiiaPre-
tervirg Health and Beauty.
-'Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most' efficient
fllelnlectant and purifier In nature, but
few realize its value when taken Into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose. â¢ Â¦
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; It in not a
drag at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present
in the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
â¢nions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion. It whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect In the- stomach and bowels- it
disinfects the mouth and throat from-
tbe poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best'
charcoal and the most for the money Is
In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are. composed of the nnest powdered
Willow charcoal, and .other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz-
enges, the -charcoal, being mixed with
honey.
The dally use of these lozenges will
coon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
Ion. : sweeter breath and purer ' blood
and the beauty of It is that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use. but. on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician In . speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: * "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering fromgas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
Jon and purify the breath; mouth and
throat; I also believe' the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily., use of .them-
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
Crug stores, and although in some sense
h patent preparation,- yet- \- believe I

Six Vessels Detailed to "Shadow" the
Baltic Squadron.
GIBRALTAR, Oct. 26. â The ships
of the channel fleet have filled their
bunkers with coal and replenished
their ammunition and will be ready
for sea at a moment's notice. The
battleship Hannibal and the cruiser
Doris are watching the stralta close
ly. There Is great activity at . the
dock yards, where men are working
night and day. Â¦ The Admiralty is mak
ing inquiries concerning' the coal avail
able here.
The battleships Victorious, Illustri
ous and Majestic (flagship of Vice Ad
miral Beresford) and the cruisers Lan
caster, Theseus and Endymlon are un
der orders to sail on the morning of
October 28. It is rumored that the
purpose Is to shadow that portion of
the Russian Baltic squadron which is
expected to go byway of the Cape of
Good Hone. The Russian Baltic
squadron's cruisers and torpedo â¢ boats
are expected to pass through the
straits of Gibraltar on the way to
Suez.
The whole of the Gibraltar torpedo
flotilla has been commissioned.
BRITISH SHIPS COALING.
The Morning Post's Copenhagen cor
respondent gives a report that the cap
tain of a British steamship, after pass
ing the Baltic sauadron on- -Friday
evening in the North Sea, saw two
miles away a two-funneled steamship
in distress, which apparently sank be
fore he was able to reach her. It Is
suggested that the steamship had been
attacked by the Baltic squadron.
" Lord Rosebery, in sending a check
for $500 for the sufferers, describes the
North Sea affair as an "unspeakable
outrage."
An equally bellicose tone character
izes the British correspondents' dis
patches from St. Petersburg, - .which
openly impute the Russian delay, to the
belief that Great Britain is determined
not to risk war, and express, the
viction that the Russian -Government
is determined not to punish the of
fending officers.
Without going to these lengths,
nearly all the papers are discussing the
possibilities of . war, should the war
party in St. Petersburg be able to in
fluence the Emperor and] Government
into a determination to shield the offi
cers of the Baltic squadron. The un
official explanation of Admiral Rojest
vensky,; telegraphed from Vlgo, ! ls stig r
matlzed by the Morning Post and other
papers as apparently -that of a lunatic,
whose Continuance in a position of re
sponsibility is a menace to every vessel
that navigates the seas. .' Â¦ t
The Daily Telegraph, representing
the Government view, says: . "There
Is no doubt whatever of the Govern
ment's seriousness. .â¢ No - responsible
Minister would order, a fleet athwart
the path of vessels of a foreign. power 1
without recognizing the .responsibility
of. such a grave step;: yet this is what
his Majesty's Government has I done,
with its eyes wide open." .
LONDON, Oct. 21.â The tone of com
parative ' moderation and ; calmness
hitherto shown by the. press of London
is observed to be yielding to one of an
outspoken bellicose nature. The Daily
Mail . editorially : speaks of < war threat
ening, and gives .in scare; headlines:
"Ultimatum to Russia Expires This
Afternoon."
British Press Would Have Nation Fly
at Russia's Throat.
EDITORS YEARX FOR WAR.
V. The weather on the night In question
was rather hazy. The Russians saw
no fishermen and were not aware that
any' damage had been done. . Evidently
the flshermen.had shown no lights. " Â¦
"The transport Anatol, 1 which \ was
steaming ahead, of the squadron, was
suddenly surrounded by eight torpedo
boats and requested assistance/ where
upon the 'battleship division advanced
and signaled to the unknown vessels to
leave or disclose , their nationality. The
vessels; refused to obey and : advanced
among the Russian battleships. Sud
denly a cannon shot was heard from
an unknown vessel. Then the admiral
formed in battle, line and replied to the
fire,, afterward continuing his voyage."
Prince . Keretelli added that 'the Â¦ Rus
sians feared Hhe strange torpedo-boats
were I Japanese, : as the admiral was
aware that the Japanese had purchased
such boats In England..
% Prince Keretelll, an officer of the bat
tleship Emperor Alexander III, has
been interviewed and. gives'-the follow
ing explanation of the attack by the
Baltic squadron upon the British trawl
ers off Dogger Bank:
EXPLANATION OF TRAGEDY.
The Spanish warships Marques de la
Victoria and Vasco Nunez deBalbaoare
keeping watch along the coast The au
thorities have ordered that all ; fishing
boats shall fly the national flag in order
to . avoid i a repetition of the Dogger
Bank incident.
* Â« It. is . rumored that the-, object /of . the
Spanish Government 'in, requesting the
Russians to remain. the shortest possi
ble time at /Vigo is to prevent the pos
sibility of attack by Japanese -agents,
whose presence. in the province of Ga
licia is suspected.
It is learned that three other Russian
warships have anchored in Arosa Bay.
The Government has refused them per
mission to coal in Spanish waters.
Later Admiral Rojestvensky, accom
panied by the commanders of his fleet,
visited the Military . Governor, the
French Consul and the commander 'of
the port, receiving the, usual honors.
"As.far as can be seen : the : crews , of
the battleships are very uneasy. Senti
nels are closely, watching every move
ment within the : harbor. . All four of
Jthe warships seem, to. 1 be cleared for
action. ,':<Â¦ -Â¦ .-. ".-. . Â¦' " ->s .v. ...'.. : - Â¦-
In spite of this, five German colliers
anchored in port alongside . the battle
ships, whereupon the commander of
the port sent an aide de, camp to beg
Admiral Rojestvensky not to violate
Spanish neutrality, and he also ordered
the commanding officer of the Spanish
cruiser Estremadura to notify the. col
liers that they must, obey the port
authorities. Eventually Admiral Ro
jestvensky promised that he .would not
coal in Spanish, waters, at the same
time begging permission for each war
ship to take on 400 tons. of. coal to pro-*
ceed to Tangier^ Eventually. three col
liers proceeded to Tangier, two remain
ing alongside, the. warships.
SHIPS CL.KARED FOR ACTION'.
VIGO. Spain, Oct.\26.â The arrival of
the Russian battleships Emperor Alex
ander III, Borodino.V Orel and .Knlaz
Souvaroff arid the} transport -\ Anatol,
which have anchored In this port, has
caused Â¦ considerable" excitement.
The commander of the portimmedl
ately boarded the Russian flagship and
Informed Admiral' Â¦ Rojestvensky .; that
the Spanish Government could not per
mit the warships to coal .within the
port. Admiral Rojestvensky . replied
that. his vessels needed repairs and for
that reason he had separated : from the
remainder. 'of .his '.squadron.'-'; The com
mander of the port promised to Inform
the Spanish Government of the ; admi
ral's statement and communicate the
Government's reply as soon as it was
received.
Baltic Fleet Puts
In at Vigo With
Explanation.
FEAR MARS SIGHT
Colonial Secretary Lyttelton, speak
ing at Leamington to-night, said he
had no further information to disclose,
but that he had no doubt Russia would
make full reparation and punish the
offenders.
Information has reached the press
from an authoritative source that puts
a brighter light upon the situation. It
is understood that practically every
thing has been decided upon to the sat
isfaction of Count Lamsdorff, the Rus
tisn FVrsign Minfater. except the ques
tion of the punishment of the offending
officers of the Baltic squadron. It is
further understood that Great Britain
is not demanding final and formal writ
ten undertakings before announcing
that she is satisfied, but that an under
taking In general terms on the part of
Russia will be accepted as sufficient
pruarantee for an official announcement
that the crisis has passed.
Hitherto there has been no indication
that a time limit had been set by Great
Britain for Russia's . reply to her de
mands, but the fact that three battle
ships and three cruisers are under or
ders for the morning of October 2S is
construed in some quarters to mean
that Great Britain will not wait longer
than that date before unleashing her
sea dogs, while it is also evident that
the Russian cruisers and smaller boats
of the Baltic squadron may find diffi
culty in passing the gateway to the
East unless the crisis is completely
over by the time they reach the en
trance to the Mediterranean.
Meanwhile the Admiralty Is not idle.
Reports from all naval stations show
that a tremendous state -of activity ex
ists. This is especially true of Gibral
tar, from which place it Is announced
that some of the best of Great Britain's
â¢war vessels are under orders to pro
ceed in the direction of the Russian
Baltic squadron, and that all the ships
of the British channel fleet are ready
to go to sea at a moment's notice.
LONDON, Oct. 26.â Tension increases
as time passes without a definite settle
ment of the situation created by the
Russian blunder In the Xorth Sea. Em
bassador Benckendorff's tentative com
rr.unication to Foreign Minister Lans
downe to-day, and the fact that this
was regarded as unsatisfactory, only
terved to inflame the public mind, and
while official circles are giving out In
timations that it is their confident be
lief that the whole matter will be satis
factorily arranged it is now quite cer
tain that only a short time will be al
lowed Russia in Vhlch to give final and
complete assurances of her intentions
to comply with any and all demands
Great Britain may make within reason.
The arrival of Admiral Rojestvensky
at Vigo and the certainty that he Is in
direct communication with his Govern
ment removes at once the possibility
of any delay on account of the inability
of Russia to get her side of the occur
rences on the night of October 21. With
this official version before the Russian
Government, together with the official
etatements of the members of the fish
ing fleet. It is unlikely that the British
public or the British Government will
allow another twenty-four hours to
pass quietly without receiving a satis
factory reply to the note, which de
manded a quick answer.
word has been received from Vice Ad
miral Rojestvensky. The official con
tinued:
"The delay in getting the Russian
version of the North Sea affair is prov
ing exceedingly embarrassing to this
Government It is felt that in the In
flamed state of British public opinion
the inexplicable absence of any official
report is becoming a most serious fac
tor and renders still more difficult an
already delicate situation."
While the good faith of the Russian
Government In its efforts to probe the
affair is not questioned, it is evident
from renewed British inquiries at the
! Foreign Office and Admiralty on Wed-
I nesday that, while no time limit for a
â¢ response to the British note has been
fixed, King Edward's Government is
neither in a humor nor a position to
brook unreasonable delay. It is real
ized here that each day's delay will
render the temper of the people of both
countries more uncertain. The hope is
expressed at the Admiralty that the re
port will be received to-day.
One danger of complications dis
cussed here lies in the possibility that
Great Britain may deem it necessary to
dispatch warships to warn and protect
British trawlers off the Spanish coast.
On the other hand, if the nature of Ro
jestvensky's report renders the recall
of the Baltic . squadron imperative, it
will weigh greatly In Japan's favor and
have a serious bearing on the â¢ future
course of the war in the Far East.
The six-inch guns and ammunition
for the Empress, when used as an aux
iliary cruiser, are stored" at the Esqul
malt navy yard ready at an hour's
notice to be mounted. Naval officers
said that they would not be surprised
to see the Empress of Japan ordered
to the Esquimau naval dock at once
to Â¦â¢ have her guns mounted and
ammunition put aboard. It is now
considered probable that H. M. S.
Graf ton's projected cruise to Honolulu,
scheduled for Friday, wilr be canceled.
The . naval officials are . In constant
communication with London.
all reparation for the trawler outrage.
The rumor Is said to have come in a
private cablegram from London. The
report that the Canadian Pacific
steamship Empress of Japan had been
ordered to proceed no further" than
Yokohama this trip and that all her
Hongkong freight had been taken- off
again at Vancouver has : caused con
siderable excitement in navy circles.

attendants at the Institute.
According to A. R, Sprague, presi
dent of the California Fruit Exchange
at Sacramento, whose paper was the
first one read at the afternoon session,
the fruit industry of California Is thor
oughly demoralized, so far as the sale
of the product is concerned. Mr.
Sprague is now in Chicago, and his
paper was read by Secretary Clark.
"Conditions are deplorable in Chi
cago," declared Mr. Sprague, "so far
as- the prune and raisin growers' in
terests are concerned. Dealers - op
erate to demoralize prices, alleging
that the instability of the price scale
In the past has caused them to lose
much money, and so they handle
prunes and raisins from California
enly when the demand Is urgent for
them, and they cut and slash rates
when they have to secure the fruit, so
that the man in California can ex
pect nothing from them but continued
demoralization of the industry."
Mr. Sprague's topic was ".The Es
sentials of Agricultural Organiza
tion." He referred to the failure of
prune growers' and raisin growers' or
ganizations, and said that unless the
fruit Interests were too much discour
aged to think of making another at
tempt he would suggest the forma
tion of a company with sufficient cap
ital to pay for the growers' product,
Â¦with an agreement v to handle such
product for five years, the product to
be paid for at the market rate when
the contract was made, with 50 per
cent of the . profits made - during the
Judge Peter J. Shields of Sacra
mento held the attention of the insti
tute while he read a paper on "The
Material, Social and Educational Value
of Instruction In Agriculture." The
university received from Judge Shields
a compliment for the great work it
has done and is now performing: for
the State's horticultural and agricul
tural Interests. He declared the uni
versity was the best investment the
_State ever made, citing, as instances
"of the work done for the farmers ! and
other sections of the public, the dis
covery and application of new reme
dies for pests, new methods of tilling
and fertilizing, new methods of cul
ture and new conveniences of all sorts.
Professor Hilgard urged upon all
who listened and upon those who
might hear through others of his re
marks the Importance and necessity of
sittenilon to detail. "The same atten
tion paid to the culture of land as is
given to the care and control of cor
porations would always result," said
the speaker, "In greater corresponding
dividends for the investor."
President Wheeler spoke first at the
jnorning session, his subject being "Re
cent Developments in Agricultural Ed
ucation." He reviewed at length the
progress made in recent years in farm
life, dealing with both the material and
Focial features of the life. He declared
that men who are most closely related
to the agricultural interests of the
country are swiftly learning their true
place and importance in the economy
of the nation. "Master of all trades is
the farmer," said the speaker. "The
civilization of the world is built upon
the soil, and upon its intelligent hand
ling depends the well being of the peo
ple â all of the people." -
Professor E. W. Hilgard, dean of the
College of Agriculture, delivered an ad
dress that excited apparently more in
terest than any of the other able and
weighty papers read during the insti
tute. His topic was "The Evolution of
Modern Agriculture." Beginning with
the earliest days, when most primitive
methods were used by the husbandman ,
and waste and Inefficiency character
ized of necessity the operations of all
men who tilled the soil and attempted
to feed themselves and the world, Pro
fessor Hilgard traced the progress made
by farmers of Europe, Asia and this
country, giving his hearers a vivid con
ception of the changes in methods and
results that have occurred with the
passage of the years.
"Ail the possibilities of soil cultiva
tion are not known," he announced,
"any more than are all the possibilities
In any other field of human endeavor,
but so tremendous are the strides that
have been taken by farmers, especially
during the. last decade, that the present
time may be accepted as a fit moment
for congratulation over triumphs
achieved."
Professor Elmer E. Brown presided at
the morning session, Professor E. J.
"U'ickson in the afternoon and Professor
W. A. Setchell at night. The general
topics discussed at the three sessions
were "Agricultural Education," "Agri
cultural Organization" and "Agricul
tural Research."
BERKELEY, Oct. 26.â The Fanners'
Institute to-day listened to addresses
dealing: -with problems of peculiar inter
est to farmers by men prominent in the
agricultural work of the State. Some
of the speakers were men connected
with the university, others were plain
fanners, while still others represented
professions not always looked upon as
connected with agriculture.
The auspicious opening: of the three
days' institute in the Greek Theater
yesterday proved to be but the begin
ning of a well attended and unusually
successful gathering, the three sessions
to-day being replete with valuable
features, enjoyed to the full apparently

women In charge of the sale, and the
public is earnestly invited to co-op

commodious and modern home for the
little ones.
Nothing is too old, too odd or too
much out of fashion to be acceptable
to the managers of the sale. Persons
in search of bargains should remember
this sale, as there will be up for dis
posal clothing of all descriptions, fur
niture, carpets, rugs, curtains, orna

A visit to the present home of the
little waifs will shew that the need
of a new building with a capacity for
housing ,more children is very ur
gent. Applicants are turned away
every day owing to lack of proper ac-.
commodations. The beds in the dormi
tories are crowded together by twos
and threes, the plumbing is old and
bathing facilities are primitive.
The lack of accommodation is pain
fully apparent to the most casual ob
server. To accommodate . the nurses
and provide sleeping rooms for the
boys extra buildings were erected some
time ago, and even these are now filled
to overcrowding. The rooms of one
old structure that was formerly a
conservatory are now used as a work
room, directors' room and study.

lunch two firms manufacturing pho

Consul Kaiser regards the actions of
Torres as having been malicious. He
says that while. Mexican policemen are
not usually armed with revolvers, Tor
res himself armed the one he sent after
Way with a pistol. The people of Aguas
Calientes were much incensed at the act
of the Alcalde. Torres is still in jail.
Consul Kaiser is so indignant over it
that he is paying the expenses of his
trip home in order to lay the matter
before the authorities of the State De
partment at the national capital.
The affair is of great interest owing
to the high official connections of the
accused Alcalde. His uncle, Luis H.
Torres, is at present in this city with
the Vice President of Mexico. General
Torres is commander of the first war
zone.
: The policeman was punished Â¦with
death, but the Alcalde was fined 5500
and sentenced to ten months in "ar
rest." While the policeman did the kill
ing, it was done under orders from
Senor H. Torres, and his punishment
is not regarded as adequate. Consul
Kaiser will lay the matter before the
authorities at Washington, with a de
mand that more suitable reparation be
exacted for the murder of the two
Americans.
Latimer, who was a close friend of
Way, happened to be near by. He heard
the altercation and arrived just as his
compatriot fell dead. Burning with in

thorities to order the arrest of Way.
This was refused, and Senor Torres
himself signed a warrant for the person
of Clarence Way, dead or alive.
A Mexican policeman took the war
rant and executed it to the letter. Whe n
the fellow accosted Way the American
resisted, not knowing why he should be
arrested. The policeman drew a re
volver and fired, killing Way almost
instantly.

orderly behavior one Saturday evening
in the redllght section of O'Farrell
street, was fined $100 by Judge Mogan.

money to "contribute, to the city's main
tenance, she surlily snapped, ."Naw, but

Louis Gracce, a diminutive Italian
with one arm terminating at the elbow,
declined to accept dismissal on the
condition that he pledge himself to shun

English, would be absolutely arid to

Judge Fritz to understand, that was
not curtailed by the amputation of one
of his forearms. No, he would not swear
off indulgence in intoxicants, and the
court might do its worst.
The court did not do its worst, but
sentenced the fiery little man to thirty
days' imprisonment. : and exnresse-V a
hope that at the end of that period
his senses would be sufficiently clarified
to enable him - to * appreciate the error
of his obstinacy.
"It's a nice thing that a lady can't
sit down in a public square and close
her eyes without being arrested for it,"
was the rather evasive answer. "I'd
like to know what public squares are
for, if a lady can't sit. down in one of
them and close her eyes."
"Public squares are not maintained
as public sleeping places," his Honor
retorted, "nor were they ever intended
to be used as public drinking places.
You both drank and slept in Union
square, the policeman says."
"I'd like to hear the policeman say
what he spilled that sherry for," said
the defendant.
Then she was pronounced guilty of
misdemeanor. - '.: :
"Why did you fall asleep where the
officer found you?" asked Judge Mogan
when he obtained opportunity to insert
the query edgeways.
Mrs. Cordelia Burbank of 174 Fourth
street denied that whisky was contained
in the flask found in her possession
when she was arrested for sleeping at
3:20 o'clock p. m. on a bench in Union
square. The liquor was sherry, she de
clared, and she would like to know
something definite about the statute
which authorized the policeman to spill
the tipple. This desire on her part was
inspired by doubt that any such statute
existed. In fact, she firmly believed
'that the destruction of her property
was an offense punishable by law, and
she proposed to stand upon her rights
as a taxpayer.
R. A. Woods of Westport, Mendo
cino County, told a very remarkable
tale of how he had been waylaid and
robbed by James Cullen one night last
week on Fourth street and at its con
clusion Judge Mogan dismissed the
case and advised the narrator to re
turn to the redwoods.
It was about 7 o'clock ~>. ra. t Mr.
Woods testified, when Fourth street
suddenly swam around him and then
disappeared entirely. Shortly after 5
o'clock the following morning Fourth
street gradually reappeared to his
vision and he found himself prostrate
upon one of its sidewalks. The ten
hour interim would'have been an un
broken blank if some Samaritan had
not raised his head and poured a gen
erous dose of whisky down his throat.
He had rather hazy recollection of
that act of kindness, he said, and it
was evidently the whisky then ad
ministered that led the policeman who
effected his permanent j resuscitation
to suspect that he was drunk. How
much money he had been robbed of
he could not clearly remember, nor
could he positively identify Mr. Cullen
as the author of his protracted stay
in oblivion. But that he was struck
down- and plundered and that he was
not drunk when stricken down he
would swear.
When it was disclosed that Cullen
had been arrested on suspicion, chiefly
based on the fact that he was impe
cunious and idle, the court abruptly
disposed of the case.
As the jackal clings to the lion and
the pilot fish adheres to the shark, so
did Mr. Bancroft stick to Mr. Troy.
When Mr. Troy did his probing afoot
Mr. Bancroft also walked. When Mr.
Troy used hi3 buggy Mr. Bancroft
dogged him on a bicycle. And even
when the day's touring was finished
and Mr. Troy enjoyed, rest in the bos
om of his family Mr. Bancroft loitered
in a nearby tonsorial parlor and en
gaged the proprietor thereof to saun
ter with seeming absence of intent
past the Troy domicile, but really,
Mr. Troy believed, to ascertain what
was going on therein. So wearied did
Mr. Troy at last become of the inter
minable espionage that he liled formal
complaint against his Nemesis and
made the charge disturbing the peace.
After hearing all the testimony
Judge Cabaniss said that it proved the
defendant's guilt as accused.
Mr. Troy, who is an insurance
agent, testified that the complained-of
."shadowing" began . immediately af
ter his participation in a mass meet
ing of Richmond district residents, at
which steps were taken to effect some
reforms in the street railway service
of that region. It was alleged by
some of the orators that a fatal car
accident of recent occurrence was at
tributable to inefficiency on the part
of the men who had charge of the*
vehicles, and Mr. Troy promised to
investigate that and other matters
pertaining to the management of the
United Railroads in its relationship to
public convenience and safety. Pur-
Buant to that pledge he sallied forth
to inspect ana interview, soon to find
that his every movement was watched
by Mr. Bancroft, whom he had pre
viously suspected of being employed
as a "capper" by the street railroad j
corporation.
Roy Bancroft of 1013 Hayes street
was convicted yesterday of disturbing
the peace by persistently "shadow
ing" E. P. E.Troy'of 632 Point Lobos
avenue, and Police Judge Cabaniss
imposed a fine of $30, which was paid-
For peddling lottery tickets in pub
lic places Fred Johnson was fined $100
by Judge Mogan.
Charles Davis was intoxicated when
he pursued Secretary Henry Huber of
the Cooks' and Waiters' Union all
over the headquarters of that organ
ization with, an upraised chair and
intent to do great bodily' harm. Judge
Fritz fined Mr. Davi3 $10.
William Adams, professional deliv
erer of meat to retail customers, was
lighting a cigarette when his horse
bolted and scared many pedestrians on
Market street ere he could get it un
der control. His attorney asked the
complaining policeman if he had wit
nessed the cigarette lighting, and when
answered in the negative moved for
dismissal on the ground that the pros
ecution had utterly failed to show that
the runaway was attributable to care
lessness on the part of the defendant.
Ere the court could rule on the motion
the defendant conveyed chagrin to his
legal representative by confessing that
hf had relinquished his grip of the
reins in order to roll and light a ci
garette.
Case continued.

NADEAU'S THROW SAVES GAME.
Professor Howison's diatribe against
newspaper men, whom he characterized
as "lost souls," gave him fame a year
ago of a sort unlike the distinction he
had achieved as a philosopher and dis
tinguished savant.. His fulminatlon
against football is apparently destined
to win for him another brand of fame.
Of football Professor Howison says:
"We are by countenancing football
merely going back to the days of the
Roman gladiators. The game is a
brutal one and suggests all the repul
siveness of the age when men urged
each other to fight in an arena ,merely
for the sport of the thing. The modern
football game has all the marks and Is
simply another form of the gladiatorial
contests of the Latins. Thousands of
persons crowd around the gridiron, as
the Latings did about the pit, and cheer
and cheer if some player is carried off
the field severely or fatally injured."
Professor Howison's attack upon the
game which university men consider
worthy of worship and which the uni
versity authorities foster by spending
large sums of money taken in at the
games as grate receipts has stirred the
university to the center. The buzz of
conversation is heard on campus and
in hall in discussion of the professor's
extraordinary attack upon the college
sport.
OAKLAND, Oct. 26.â Football is con
demned by Professor George H. Howi
son, Fiead of the philosophy department
of the University of California, as a
brutal and a repulsive sport, similar in
character to the barbarous pastimes of
the Romans of old.

in the third race, but his mount was
cot Quite straight when the barrier
\^as released, and he was thus com
pelled to go on the outside all around
the Qrst turn.
Those who backed Hildebrand's
mounts in the fourth, fifth and sixth
races had excellent '"parleying." Coy
i^aia was at 6 to 1, Ocean Tide at 6
U> 5 and Major Daingerfield at 16 to
I. A flve-dollar bill on the three "par
leyed" v.ould have yielded $220.
Coy Maid's victory in the Packer
stakes was noteworthy, inasmuch as
thai fÂ«lly was cut across by Thirty
thirc on the far turn and was taken
up Fhort. Then she attempted to "run
out," and Kildebrand was forced to

-withstand her rush. Coy Maid is a
daughter of Kingston. She is a much
improved filly, for though she won a
ffctv days a?o she was meeting a better
field of allies to-day. The "club
house element," which is smaller than
at any time this year, profited well by
Coy Maid's success, and followed it
Dp in the last race won by Major
Daingerfield. New York led up to the

He worked an hour In the gymna
sium in the afternoon, going -through
3.11 of his exercises, and wound up the
day's work with the seven-round spar
ring match with Kid Sullivan.
Joe still weighs about 135 pounds
and will make no endeavor to get be
low that figure until about Saturday.
He says making the required weight is
a pipe.
Referee Eddie Graney will see Joe
work out. to-day.
There was not a pool ticket sold on
the flght yesterday, but speculation is
expected to commence to-day. Good
judges of price expect the betting -will
go to 10 to 8 at once, with Gans favor
ite.
The so-called sparring match to-day
was fast and furious. The champion
and Sullivan fought away for seven
h^.rd rounds and at the finish the clar
etj was flowing profusely from the Kid's
nose and he looked anything but a
daisy. Joe tried to coax him to come
back for more, but "Xay, nay, Pau
line." wac the Kid's reply. As Frankie
McDonald was taking off the Kid's
gloves, the latter whispered, "Say, Mac,
I'd hate to be Britt next Monday
night."
Gans seems in perfect condition and
says he never felt better In his life. He
likes the climate of Marin County and
says he enjoys training there. Yester
day morning he took hia usual run of
fourteen miles and returned to camp
breathing easily.
Everything is running as smooth as
glass at Joe Gans' training quarters at
Billy Shannon's villa, with the excep
tion of those so-called sparring
matches. Kid Sullivan says of them:
"I would hate to be Britt when Joe
fights."
The spectators say, "How would you
like to be the Kid?"
Vice President Corral of Mexico was
the most distinguished visitor at Jim
my Britt's training quarters yesterday
at Croll's Gardens in Alameda. He
watched {he little boxer go through a
three-round slugging match of the
fiercest description with Frank Rafael
and enjoyed the performance as much
as he would a bull fight In his own
country. There were many other call
ers besides the man from 'Mexico. The
symnasium was crowded when Britt
began his work at 3:30. In addition to
sparring Jimmy tossed the medicine
ball, wrestled with "Tiv" Kreling,
punched the bag and operated the
wrist machines and skipped the rope.
In the morning Britt went four miles
on the road, sprinting and walking al
ternately. After returning he took his
usual dip in the bay and then submtt
ted himself to a rubdown. Jimmy In
dulged in his last boxing and from now
until he ceases training will substitute
shadow sparring for the real thing.
Britt announces that he never felt bet
ter while training for any of his pre
vious ring contests and his appearance
boars out his assertion. There is not
that drawn look about him that charac
terized his appearance when he was
ready to battle Young Corbett. The per
spiration flows freely during his work,
showing he is well above himself. In
his boxing he does not assume the
graceful attitude made familiar by
Gar.s and Erne, but seems to slouch
about. This impression vanishes the
instant he delivers a blow, when it is
apparent he is a mass of nervous en
ergy.

The day's sport was marred by an
unfortunate accident. Edward Geers,
the veteran driver ana trainer, was ex
ercising Joymaker, a trotter, and.
on turning into the stretch at a fast
clip, collided with one of several track
wagons on the ground. His sulky "was
tilted high in the air and Geers was
thrown heavily to the ground. When
assistance reached him it was found
ht had sustained severe injuries. onÂ»
leg being broken and the other badly
injured. Geers was taken to a hospital,
where to-nlvht it is rumored hÂ» is rest
ing easy. His injuries are regarded as
bctIous. Summary:

cheer greeted the performance, and
Hersey was almost carried from h\?
Â¦ulky on his return to the stand. ThÂ»
wlnd-Khield used was the same as that
employed when Lou Dillon trotted a
mile in l:58H. It consisted of a strip of
canvas about four feet square attached
to the sulky of the running pacemaker.
Another sensational performance was
that of Major Delmar, E. E. Smathers'
trotting champion, when he trotted a
mile to a high-wheel sulky in 2:07 flat.
It was announced by the Judges before
the trial that the sulky was non-ball
bearing and weighed 54U pounds. It
was also explained that the vehicle was
of the same pattern aa that used by
Maud 8 In her mexr&rable flight against
time in 1SS4, when she trotted a mile
in 2:0SH.
Major Delmar was driven by Alta

warmed up in splendid Â¦nape and.
after scoring once, he was sent away.
With clocklike precision the brown
Overall, as usual, was the center of
attraction and barring two innings he
had, every Commuter looking like a
weakling- Jones was also in right,
fanning nine while he lasted. He
could not hold together when the pace
began to get too rapid and after the
Tigers had rolled two in during the
seventh it was curtains.
The Tigers managed to score on two
hits and Jones' misplay in the third.
Oakland could not land till the sixth.
Then Stark swung through to center
for a swell two-bagger and Ganley
set the fans howling when he ripped
off one out to deep right field, bring
ing Stark in and making it a deadlock.
The Tigers were right there with the
big comeback in the seventh. Two were
quickly chased over the pan.. This ad
vantage was followed up in the suc
ceeding round, three more being en
ticed in, cinching the contest for fair
and taking every bit of fight out of
the Commuters. The score:

The Commuters were all In after the
sixth spasm had been reeled off yes
terday afternoon at Recreation Park
and the Tigers got another installment
of revenge. Just to lend tone to the
struggle and show the fans that Oak
land could go some, even if their
chances looked dim, Dunleavy rapped
the sphere over the right field fence in
the ninth with two to the woods and
Francks on second base. Score: Ta
coma 6, Oakland 3.
The game might have been another
of those sensational boys had the
Junkie Imps refrained from batting so
hard toward the end of the contest.
It was a pretty fight for five rounds,
with the score one-all. Then Jones
began to look easy and hi3 fielders
waxed sloppy, so the rest was one
simple task for the Tigers.

has done me a great deal ofgood. I intend
to continue to use it, as I believe it to bo
the best Blood Medicine on the market.

For over fifteen years I have suffered
more or less from Impure Blood. About a
rear ago I had a boll appear on my leg
below the knee, which was followed by
three more on my neck. I saw 8. 8. S.
advertised and decided to try it. After
taking three bottles all Boils disappeared
and I have not been troubled any since.

Chief Charles Mehan of the. Chinese
Bureau is not convinced that the thir
ty-two Chinese men who arrived re
cently on the Doric, ostensibly ori the
way to the St. Louis Exposition, are
acting in good faith. They had no
papers to show that they were en
gaged by any particular concession.
Chief Mehan addressed an inquiry to
the Bureau officers on duty at the
Chinese Village regarding these men,
but it appears that no one of the many
concessions was willing to claim them.
It is believed that they came hither
with the . intention of remaining in
the country after the close of the ex
position, but that the arrest of Lee
Toy and Da SilvaÂ»and the exposure
of the conspiracy to land Chinese il
legally broke the connections and left
the thirty-two stranded.

Attention ha* recently bÂ«Â«n called to the
necessity of Improvement Jn the quality ot
wheat raised In California, and the figures
show the importance of the ,Â«ubject and the
necessity of action being taken. The crops of
wheat of the last few years have been as
fuJlowe: 1901. 830,000 tons; 1902. 500.000 tons;
1903. 470,000 tons, and 1904. estimated at 400.
000 tons. Not only has acreage been decreased,
but the yield of wheat per acre- haÂ» been below
the average, partly owing to climatic reasons.
Due Importance must also be given to the fact
that our wheat lands have been continuously
cropped for a long number of years without
any attempt at rotation of crops and without
any attempt to renew the soil by adding the
necessary ingredients that have been gradually
exhausted. Â¦
The wheat fanner has done his best by
giving hi* land a rest by the system of sum
mer fallowing and the seeding of crops but
once In two years; but this does not seem to
be sufficient. In other States the question of
the quality^ of the wheat produced baa re
ceived earnest attention and large sums of
money have been appropriated by the States
for the purpose of making such Investigations
as will assist In enhancing the quality and
quantity of the grain raised. In California
absolutely nothing has been done In this Hne,
and It Is beyond question a matter of the most
vital importance that proper Investigation
should be initiated and experiments conducted.
This would mean an I expenditure by â¢ the
State of not to- exceed- $5000 per. annum and
the results that are sure to be returned would
be of the utmost value to the farmer, the land -
owner and miller and the welfare of the State
, generally. Investigations would be conducted
along two lines â first, the breeding or pro
curing of a Bpecles of wheat that would retain
its glutenous qualities, and secondly, the
proper means of economically and practically
restoring the lands that show symptoms of
being worn out.
The wheat crop of California In future will
be raised ) on much smaller units than has
hitherto been the case. Only in exceptional
cases has wheat been raised by means of irri
gation, but with the land being gradually cut
Into email farms and water being applied
throughout the length and breadth of the State
much of the future crop of wheat of California
will be assisted In Its growth by applying
water by artificial means. To do this it Is not
necessary that the growing plant itself should
be saturated. It has been shown beyond a
doubt that It would be most advantageous to
give the land a thorough soaking before seed
irig and . thereby assure a sufficient supply of
moisture underneath for the use of the plant
during its growing season. Working the land
In smaller units, the matter of fertilization can
be handled, which Is practically Impossible
with fields of the present stxe. Under these
conditions the yield per acre will be doubled.
The ordinary accepted ratio of consumption
in the United States is one barrel of flou r per
capita. It is uncertain as to whether this
ratio will hold good In California, but in view
of its cosmopolitan population and In view of
the fact tbat a comparatively small amount of
corn flour is used it is probable that the con
sumption per capita in this State is the equiva
lent of 285 pounds of wheat. Taking this ratio
of consumption, the population of the State of
California is at present 1,766, (500 persona. The
census of 1900 gives the population of Cali
fornia as being 1,485,063.
Secretary T. C." Friedlander of the
Merchants' Exchange has secured some
very striking figures from all the flour
millers of California, which emphasize
the general statements that have been
pvfblished recently in reference to the
shortage in the milling wheat produc
tion of this State. According to these
authoritative sources of information
there were produced in California in
the twelve months ending June 30. 1904,
2,188,238 barrels of flour. The exports of
flour from this State during the same
twelve months were 917,176 barrels,
while the imports of flour into Califor
nia amounted to 583,197 barrels. As
suming that the stocks of flour amount
ed to the same on July 1, 1904, and
July 1, 1903, the amount of flour actu
ally consumed in California was 1,854,
259 barrels.
The flour millers' returns also show
that in the designated twelve months
they ground 71,220 tons of wheat grown
outside of California, which was about
one-fourth of the total amount ground
by them. As a rule the wheat import
ed into the State brought a higher price
than milling wheat produced at home.
The importation was made necessary
to enable the mills to obtain a wheat
supply with sufficient glutenous sub
stance to produce, when mixed with
native grown wheat, flour up to the
marketable standard. The importation
of foreign wheats into California has
Increased during the last few years,
and the amount now imported is great
er than ever before.
Mr. Friedlander reports other facts
of general interest relative to wheat, as
follows:
Finally the captain was obliged to
turn his prize loose, and, with the ex
ception of some bone taken from the
head, the catch was lost.
Antone Merido, one of the crew,
died of consumption and was buried in
the Arctic. Many of the crew were
; r. ,-n hands, and the usual troubles
between the men and officers occurred.
C. X. Fayne complains that Boat
header Church etruck him with a ham
mer, and between the captain. First
Mate Tease and the hammer-throwing
c:h'jrch he would have been killed if
the second mate, Joseph, a colored
man, had not rescued him.
The Â«Jayhead encountered a fierce
gale in the Arctic, which put her under
dose-reefed canvas for a week. The
fctorm was very inconvenient at that
time, for she had a big dead right
whale alongside, and the unwieldy car
cass bumping and pounding against
the bark stove a hole in the hull. No
blubber could be cut from the body,
but Captain Fisher grimly held on to
his prey that even In death was try
ing to sink him. For four days and
nights the skipper gave himself extra
watches on deck, where he put in the
time shaking first one fist at the living
gale that was trying to tear the masts,
out overhead and the other fist at the
dead whale that was knocking holes
In his ship's side below. The vessel's
log does not state what class of lan
guage the skipper used during this
period, but it is said that the carpen
ler's remarks had a sulphurous aroma
;is he stuffed canvas in the cracks
from the inside of the hull.
The first whaler to arrive direct from
the Arctic and Bering Sea is the
Lark Gayhtad. Captain C. \V. Fisher,
which came into harbor last evening.
She pailed from this port on March
25. acd reports a catch of five right
whales and one sperm. From the first
the has 400 ban-els of oil and from the
Â«pera 30 barrels. Captain Fisher re
ports ihat all of the whalers are out
01" the Ice and will return to San Fran
i-isco at the close of this season. He
epoke the Alice Knowles and the Mon
terey on September 25. The former
vessel had three right whales and the
latter had about 1100 barrels of oiL
He also announces that the Jeanette
had tÂ«.ken nine whales and the Bow
fcead five.
The Gayhead evidently struck a
school of fighters, as she had five boats
stove in, two of them so badly dam
aged as to be put out of commission
for. the remainder of the voyage. These
were smashed into splinters by the
whales that objected to the blubber pot.
and a cumber of the boats' crews were
hurt, though not seriously. Fortunate
ly other boats were close by and the
swimming men were pulled out of the
icy water alive.

Many a storekeeper has been robbed
systematically and extensively by. the
return to the store after hours of the
person to whom was intrusted the key
of the establishment. A means of over
coming this has been devised by F. M.
Thompson of Danbury, Vt., who has
Invented a lock which is opened with a
key entirely different from the one
which locked it. The employe carrying
the closing-up key could not return and
make his way into the store for the
reason that the lock would not respond
to his key and should the other party
try. this trick with His openlng-up key
he would not be able to close up the
establishment after - his plundering
visit. Any possible complication of this
lock may be solved by the employer,
who carries the master key, which will
operate on the lock at ' all times.
The "Safeguard" Lock.
AMONG the offices to be filled by the suffrage of the people at
the coming election is that of Associate Justice of the State
Supreme Court, a vacancy left by the expired term of Judge
William G. Lorigan. To succeed himself on the Supreme Bench the
incumbent is a candidate on the Republican ticket.
The office of Justice of the Supreme Court is one entirely di
vorced from politics and partisan issues, more so, even, than those
of the Superior judiciary. As such it should be considered by voters.
In the selection of a Supreme Court Justice there are no questions
of political policy to be subserved, no calls of partisan nature to be
heeded; the office is one apart from the interests and aims of the
rest of the elective machinery of State government. It rests with
this highest bar of justice in the commonwealth to interpret the
constitution, determine the validity of legislative action and sit on
appeals from the lower tribunals, and consequently efficiency is the
only test to be applied in the selection of its members.
To this gauge Justice Lorigan answers with his record. With
many years of experience on the Superior Bench of Santa Clara
County behind him, the Judge was appointed by the . Governor to
fill the place left vacant in the Supreme Court by the death of Jus
tice Jackson Temple in January, 1903. Lorigan has had, therefore,
competent experience in the office to which he now stands for elec
tion.. The Judge's opponent in the election, excellent man though he
may be, has had no experience in the duties he seeks to assume. The
weight' of Judge Lorigan's demonstrated worth, already proven in
the discharge of his duties on the Supreme Bench, should serve to
elect him by a large majority.

In the City of Dreams, as Lassa has
been called by the Imaginative people,
you seldom see an unmarried woman
over 20. But then the statistics} â or
what stands for them â are all in favor
of the fair sex, for there is an aver
age of about fifteen men to each wom
an. Hence it is not at all uncommon,
says a veracious traveler, to meet a
Tibetan woman out walking with a
dozen or so of her husbands. Indeed,
It was currently reported that one at
tractive matron had no fewer than
thirty-three husbands and contemplat
ed an early addition to the collection.

Pretty house gowns half negligee are
the most convenient of frocks for many
occasions. They are the acme of com
fort, yet in them one may se,e a caller
or appear at luncheon or even dinner
when the family is dining alone. For
inexpensive gowns of this order there
are the loveliest cashmeres, challls and
bargains in silks and thin wools. Plays
on the princesse robe are in order for
such dresses- Furbishlngs of velvet
and satin ribbons, laces and remnants
of silk embroideries abound on mark
down tables.
Fall walking' costumes harmonize
uncommonly/ well, this season of pic
ture effects, with the dying leaf. Even
the short' run-around morning frock
of mixed cheviot is reminiscent of
French court days with Its tightly
fitting coat, brave with vivid velvet
collar or revers and cuffsâ a suggestion
of the riding dress of the eighteenth
century- â¢
One of the incongruities of to-day's
fashions, if one study illustrations of
costumes of the periods being copied
now, is the wide dissimilarity that one
finds in the feminine figures of the old
day and the new, says the New York
Sun. mental and physical,
do not tend to make sylphllke figures.
Hence the costumes worn by the wasp
waisted beauties of the court of Louis
XVI are plainly unsulted to the girl
who has won Juno proportions by out
door good times and indoor gymnas
tics. The tall, well-developed girl, who
is in the majority now, is not at her
best in outstanding sleeve tops and
skirt hems, and her waist is seldom
suited to girdles that accentuate the
robust development of waist .and hips.
Fancy, for instance, a gown shown
recently on the sturdy college girl who
won fame on the golf links this sum
mer. The gown was copied by a French
dressmaker from an old picture in the
Louvre in Paris. It depicted all the
airy frivolity of Versailles in its gay
est period. The deep point of the
bodice fell over an overdress of rich
parchment colored silk, flowered with
old world brocade designs which were
mingled with tiny wrought silver ones.
On the hips, the overdress puffed into
decided paniers opening over a petti
coat of ivory colored net applique,
with lace leaves. The chiffon petticoat
was buit over a reseda green velvet
skirt, which .was bordered at the foot
by theÂ» leaves of lace. T>he bertha
draping the bodice was of folded silk
deeply frilled with the net and lace
ornaments. A wee .bit of sable glim
mered here and there in the lace folds.
Of the same period was a pale pea
green taffeta gown with skirt full and
plain like that of an old riding habit.
Its only ornamentations were sparse
applications of velvet flower sprays of
the same tone as the silk. The coat
was a true Louis XVI of embossed
velvet In the pea green tone. The only
relief in color were the touches of
cloudy old lace and the vest of faintly
tinted embroidery.
A restaurant gown of the same order
was of the softest old rose' taffeta
moussellne. It was trimmed with nar
row puffs of chiffon velvet of the same
shade manipulated into true lover's
knots. Deep ivory toned Mimosa lace
fashioned the petticoat front and the
bertha. W$0m

It was a woman who invented "con

wants it who can get the original arti
cle, is nevertheless of great .value on
Journeys, on shipboard and for emer
gencies. It was such an emergency,
says the Springfield Republican, that
led to the first condensed milk, for Mrs.
Albert Cashlngor of New Orleans fifty
years ago had a- sick baby and must
get expert-medical attention if it were
to live. That could not be had nearer
than New York City, and it was a long
sea voyage away. How to keep the lit
tle baby alive through that voyage she
did not know. But she had out up
many preserves and many jellies in her
time, and ehe began to experiment on
milk, and succeeded, and put up a lot
of jars of original condensed milk,
Â¦which fed her child through the voy
age. The fact interested several people
in New York, and finally Mrs. Caah
ingor grave her process away to a pack
of sharp fellows, who made fortunes
out of condensed milk and never gave
her a cent.

COPYRIGHT. 1904. BT SPECIAL, ARRANGEMENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WITH THE NEW YORK EVENING MAIL.
We wish that the solid citizens of this city could have been
in Washington at the last session of Congress to note the occu
pation of the Representatives of California. Every morning, long
before the noon hour for the meeting of the House, they would have
found Mr. Metcalf of Oakland hard at work in the Committee of
Ways and Means; Mr. Gillett with his coat off, digging away in the
Committee on the Judiciary; Mr. Needham in the Committee on
Public Lands; Mr. McLachlan busy with naval affairs and rivers
and harbors, and Mr. Daniels in the room of his leading committee,
all doing the public business of the people who sent them there,
while Mr. Livernash and Mr. Wynn were not found among the
workers of the House. We know that they may plead that Speaker
Cannon did not put them on leading committees. The truth is
that Speaker Cannon put them on such committees as were se
lected for them by John Sharp Williams, the Democratic leader of
the House. Cannon placed the Republican members and Williams
the Democratic members.
If Livernash and Wynn were put on subordinate commit
tees it was because Mr. Williams took their measure and placed
them where they seemed to fit. One of the strong reasons for leav
ing them both at home now is the indifferent estimate put upon
them by the leader of their own side of the House. They had no
strength, no popularity and no standing with the Democrats. If Mr.
Williams had thought Mr. Livernash deserving he could have put
him on the Committee of Ways and Means, giving California two
members of the leading committee of the House. But he did not
do it. Mr. Williams will be the leader of the minority in the next
House, and there is no evidence that his opinion of Livernash and
Wynn will improve any meantime. Then this great commercial city,
the American metropolis of the Pacific, with the greatest interest in
the commerce of that ocean and the greatest stake in its developmnt,
will be left with no voice in any committee that can influence its
destiny if it choose to return its two vacancies to the House !
The Call cares but little for the partisan aspect of this issue, nor
does that consideration figure influentially with" Democrats, for Liv
ernash and Wynn have nothing in common with real Democracy, and
both repudiated the Democratic party in classifying themselves in
the Congressional Directory. If there were in the House from San
Francisco a Democrat of the force, common sense and influence of
Stephen M. White, there would be good sense in keeping him there.
But what a vast distance is between Stephen M. White and Liver
rtash and Wynn!
We cannot think that these two seats are any longer debatable
We believe that Kahn and Hayes are sure of election and that San
Francisco will again go on the map.
One part of Mr. Livernasb/s campaign cannot be used in replica
by Mr. Wynn. Mr. Livernash is fruitful" of dreams that are to
be concreted by legislation, and of necessity is compelled to avoid
any statement of what he did in Congress, for he did nothing and
accomplished nothing. Under these circumstances he publishes
florid letters written to him by parties in the East, who represent
the socialistic ideas for which he stands, highly commending the
length of the speeches he made to the House in advocacy of certain
things in which his distant supporters are interested. We beg to
say in behalf of San Francisco that Mr. Livernash's constituency is
here and not in the District of Columbia or New Jersey. The in
terests he was elected to represent are the commercial and industrial
interests of San Francisco, not the communistic and other revolution
ary schemes of Eastern circles and seances of pseudo reformers.
San Francisco is not interested in the mental rainbows of Mr.
Livernash. When he rises before an audience and exclaims "Ah
Sirs," as the introduction of a rhapsody, the people of this city find
in what follows nothing that will promote enterprise, care for busi
ness, furnish employment and pay wages. If they want dreams they
can find them elsewhere. Some will choose those in Andrew Jack
son Davis' "Penetralia" in preference to the article furnished by Mr.
Livernash, and others will hunt for those figments of the mind in
the works of better dreamers than he ; but Congress is not a dream
factory. It is not a place for exploiting those creations of disturbed
digestion or uneasy sleep. It is an exceedingly practical body, in
which the Representatives of the people do something for their dis
tricts bv hard work.
THE present outlook is that California will give President Roose
velt a majority in excess of 50,000, and will send a solid Re
publican delegation to the House.
The two districts in which San Francisco, is interested were
at the beginning of the campaign regarded as debatable ground, but
it is believed that they are so no longer. The neglect of the inter
ests of this city by Mr. Livcrnash and Mr. Wynn is not forgotten
by our people/ Mr. Livernash is talking to the stars and the moon
and is uttering Utopian reveries about ideal conditions of society to
be had by act of Congress, and Mr. Wynn, lacking the imagination
of Mr. Livernash, is using a sort of chromo of the Livernash picture
to advance his own interests.

The Board of Public Works decided
yesterday to make a final official in
spection of theaters on some day next
week to ascertain if the requirements
of the ordinance as to their safety have
been complied with. Action was taken
as the result of a petition filed by the
California Theater management for a
permit so that a license may be pro
cured from the Tax Collector. %
Some time ago the board furnished
each theater with a list of necessary
alterations to make them safe from
panic and fire. -
"Unless these requirements have been
complied with," 6aid Commissioner
Schmltz, "I am opposed to granting
any permit, as I do not want to as
sume any responsibility. I understand
that the California has complied with
our directions in every respect. How
ever, I think /this board- should again
Inspect all theaters to protect itself."
The complaint of the Merchants' As
sociation that signs are being main
tained at the outer edge of. sidewalks
In violation of an ordinance resulted
in the board sending a communication
to the association asking that it adopt
a resolution requesting its members to
aid in the enforcement of the ordinance
by removing any obstructions on side
walks they themselves may be main
taining in the shape of boxes, machin-.
ery and iron. The "board thought the
latter were greater obstructions than
signs, and desires the co-operation of
the merchants in clearing the side
walks.
The secretary, .was directed to sell
fifteen tons of old iron at the corpora
tion yard.
Office Deputy Donovan reported that
pursuant to instructions he had taken
up a spur track : on Second street, : be

a committee to act on the appoint
ment. This matter provoked much ar
gument pro and con. It was finally
decided to appoint a committee of five
to canvass the churches and to raise
$600 for the payment in part of the
evangelist. Much routine work was
transacted.
The programme for to-day and to
morrow is as follows:
Convention That Their Spiritual
Welfare Is Neglected.
The neglected condition of the Cal
ifornia Indians was yesterday called to
the attention of the General Associa
tion of Congregational Ministers by
Mrs. Mary Haven Edwards. Their
spiritual welfare, she declared, had
been ignored by white Christians. In
teresting figures were quoted to show
Â¦what .the speaker turned "the abso
lute paganism" of a majority of the
Indians in the State.
The second day's session of the con
vention of the general association was
completed last evening. The princi
pal event of the day was the recom
mendation of the appointment of a
State evangelist and the selection of

The literary world couples Its In
terest with that of society in the nup
tials of Miss Bertha Runkle and Cap
tain Louis H. Bash, which took place
yesterday at nogn in the apartments
of the bride's mother, Mrs. Runkle, at
the Hotel Plymouth. Quiet and sim
plicity characterized the event that
Â¦was celebrated In the presence of only
a dozen friends. The bride wore an
esquisite gown of white lace and em
broidered crepe de chine. Immedi
ately after the ceremony the soldier
and his bride â fair as well as famous
Â¦ â left for a wedding journey that is to
be of a fortnight's duration. At the
end of the honeymoon they will re
turn to San Francisco, perhaps to be
located permanently, although Cap
tain Bash has not yet received orders.
Much pleasant entertainment awaits
the return of the soldier and his beau
tiful bride.

POMEROY, Ohio, Oct. 26.â After in
vestigating; for a month, the Grand
Jury to-day indicted County Treasurer
Thomas JV Chase, charging the embez
zlement of Â¦ $14,500 from. the. county
treasury, on y, September . 9/ when- he
claimed that the treasury was looted
by, masked robbers and himself | locked
in the. vault. "When Chase was brought
from the county treasury into the court
his .bond, was fixed at 510,000. As he
was unable to furnish bail he was re
manded to jail. â¢
. After Treasurer Chase was locked up
the Grand Jury rgsumed its investiga
tion. It is expected * that indictments
will j; be reported to-morrow against
thosi^who are charged with being con
federates and who locked Chase in the
vault,; where he .â¢ was found: by his
daughter.'.*' As it is" generally known who
is; being for complicity.,
there is much excitement here "this
evening. - Â¦'Â¦'.''>?Â¦*.:
I, Lam Tew Kuey of Pak Tsz Sher, situated
at the 6outh side of Tuk Chow, make this bill
of eale, selling forever our daughter far ' a
slave. Because of belnn short In i food â¢ and
clothing and generally helpless, my wife -and
T, after consultation. . decided Â«we should sell
our own eldest daughter, called Chan Lau,
aped 10 years, being born in the tenth month,
twentieth day, 3:05 a. m., to be other people's
elave, receiving therefore 120 taels toward de
fraying the" cost oflbrlnging her up and other
exi*nses. The offer was first made to ' our
relative*, but they were not willing: to accept.
Then the go-between, ' Mrs. " Lam (nee Miss
Chew), brought the 'matter to the attention of
Chew Kuey Lunsr Tons for him, to purchase,
which was agreed upon by all parties con
cerned. Aa word cf month may not long be
depended upon, this bill of sale was drawn up
the eame day the transaction took place, .the
amount being paid in full, in the presence of
all concerned, directly *to me (Lam "Tew
Kuey) and my wife for our own use, not leav
ing one cent unpaid. .This waa for " our
daughter called Chan -Lau, who was the same
day handed over to Chew Kuey Lung Tong to
be called thereafter a slave.
In after days, when ehe shall be grown up.
Chew Kuey Lung Tong â¢Â¦hall have the trans
ferred right of giving her in marriage to
whomsoever he may desire. She shall not be
redeemed, nor shall any other claim be made
for her. If anything unforeseen should happen
to her it must be regarded as from heaven.
This girl Is truly the natural born daughter of
Lam Tew Kuey. No dowry has ever been
accepted for her nor earnest money from any
one and there Is no debt for which she may
be held. The price money is bona fide and
this bill is genuine. Should there be anything
not entirely cleared up, that shall be a nat
ter for myself and the go-between to â¢ settle
and it shall not concern the purchaser. . .
With faith In each other, it Is not. necessary
t"> stae more, but lest hereafter there 'should
not be evidence this bill of sale in which my
daughter is forever sold as a slave Is drawn
up to be proof. . ' ' -'Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ;\ C- '*Â¦"Â¦Â¦':'Â¦Â¦
.This shall ,pe evidence of. the .fact that I
have received from Chew Kuey Lung Tong. thÂ«
sum of 120 taels and of the fact that I, Lam
Lew Kuey, have sold my own . first born
daughter, called Chan Lau, for a slave. .

A bill of sale acknowledging the trans
fer of a 10-year-old' girl* in China" by
her parents was j the feature yesterday
in the trial of the case wherein; It is
sought to remove J. J. Cunningham as
administrator of the estate of Chew
Bing Quoia, a wealthy^ Chinese 1 labor
contractor, who died last " yearv Cun
ningham was appointed at. the' request
of Lum Quoi, who claimed to be the
dead man's widow. " Chew Bing Quota's
kinsfolk oppose her pretended'relation

lives in China, while the bogus one
was only Quota's slave.*
Chew Kum Fong was examined again
yesterday. On Tuesday he Identified
the "three generations paper," ; a â¢ red
document purporting' to be a part of
the wedding contract' with Low Shee.
Yesterday the same witness; identified
the bill of sale for a girl named Chan
Lau, who, he says, is the Lum' Quoi in
the case. Fong testified ithat .the de
parted contractor 'bought the" girl in
China and that she arrived here with
Ng Shee.. She was taken to rooms over
Sam Kee & Co.'s store and kept by
Quoia. -,-.,, 'â¢-:' .
Â¦ The bill of sale covered a large sheet

The committee considered the; pro
posed ordinance prohibiting the dis
tribution . of handbills and printed
matter in doorways. Protestants from
labor unions and: other organizations
agreed that an ordinance should be
passed to stop the delivery of immoral
literature, but they ; argued >. that the
proposed law would" prohibit the de
livery, of every kind, of i legitimate lit
erature.'.* The interested j parties were
requested to frame an ordinance . to
meet- the emergency "and the ; commit
tee . agreed to . recommend' its passage.

show ; that ; more ; people - are killed or
injured by street car accidents in this
city than anywhere else. Several.cit
izens testified to the good car service
in the Richmond /District, ; where
greater speed is desirable. ./
/Captain A. H. Payson appeared be
fore: the committee Â¦ and urged" the
passage of an ordinance granting the
Santa Fe Railroad /Company, a fran
chise for a right of "way and the right
to operate a , railroad . on Indiana,
Mariposa, Seventh and- Sixteenth
streets. The committee postponed ac
tion until next Wednesday at 3 p. m.
to give protestants against a right of
way on Mariposa and Sixteenth streets
an opportunity to be heard..
DISCUSS HANDBUJjS. ; \ Â¦
ACCIDENTS ARE FREQUENT.
Tirey L: Ford, attorney for the
United . Railroads, said it would be'un
vvise to limit the speed of the; cars, as
it would prevent the development of
the suburbs and either increase^ the
population in the center of the city
or drive, it across the bay. ; Fordl de
nied Troy's . assertion that the service
had been crippled and said ifis'abs'o
lutely impossible to prevent the over
crowding of cars.' Ford thought an
ordinance was needless,' as the â¢ cars
move very . slowly, in : the downtown
district and the company had | no de
sire to run cars at a dangerous speed.
Braunhart suggested that .the 'ordi
nance fee 1 framed to i limit the speed
to -eight miles in' some districts and
fifteen- miles in others and the; com
mittee-agreed to prepare. such an or
dinance. : '.,'*Â¦'; :
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday decided Â¦ to "recommend an
ordinance limiting .the > rate of speed
of street -cars to eight Smiles .an hour
in some districts and to fifteen miles
in others to be determined later.
Representatives of the Richmond
and Point Lobos Improvement I clubs
appeared in opposition to a. proposed
ordinance limiting the speed, of street
cars in the city limits to eight miles
an hour, as they desired a higher rate
of speed in the outlying districts. - E/
Troy suggested that Â¦ cars Â¦. t provided
with electric ' or air brakes Â¦Â¦ be limited
to fifteen miles an hour: and -those
with hand brakes to ten miles on level
ground and eight miles; on : hilla.

Washington special to the Telegram
says: The Secretary of the Interior
to-day directed that 153,000 acres oC
land In the Joseph River forest reserve
In Eastern Oregon be restored to set
tlement and be opened to entry after
ninety days' advertisement.
Land to Be Opened In Oregon.
Mrs. Muenter prepared to file an
amended complaint in which all the
charges should be specific, and at that
stage, it is asserted, the defense made
a proposition to compromise in the
matter of settling the property right*.
STOCKTON. Oct. 26. â The property
interests in the Muenter dhrorce case
are in course of settlement. It is un
derstood that Mrs. Sluenter is to re
ceive one-third of the property of her
husband^ State Senator A. E. Muenter.
which is assessed for $109,000 in round
numbers. Mrs. Muenter brought suit
for divorce and for a share of the
property several weeks ago. A short
time afterward Muenter demurred to
the complaint on the ground that one
of the counts against him was not a
specific charge. The demurrer was
sustained.
Reported That State Senator Will Ef
fect a Compromise With
His Wife.

â¢ OF HER HUSBAXD'S PROPERTY
Later Huntington began again to agi
tate the construction of the proposed
cut-off and had the matter under con
sideration when death summoned him.
It was revived by General Manager
Kruttschnitt. With the completion of
the cut-off and the plans for a new
steel bridge across the bay at Dum
barton Point and a new terminal yard
at Mission Bay the Southern Pacific
Company will be in a position to handle
freight which since the opening of the
coast division has grown to such pro
portions as to cause an almost constan-s
blockade at Oakland, where great dif
ficulty is experienced in handling the
rolling stock.
Erickson & Peterson, who built the
Chatsworth Park branch of the South
ern Pacific, the Hazen tunnels In Ne
vada and did considerable work on Sen
ator Clark's road, have the contract
for the cut-off, and their representative
stated yesterday that they expect to
have about 2000 men with teams em
ployed on the new work In a few weeks.
The construction work was first sug
gested to the late Collls P. Huntington
in 1890, at the time of the starting of
the big abattoir of the Armour-Swift-
Morris combine of Chicago packers,
whose scheme was to establish them
selves near San Francisco, where they
would be able to force their meat pro
ducts on the local population In com
petition with the California meat men,
and also give the people of this city
a more expeditious service. The plans
of the Chicago meat magnates, how
ever, were abandoned.
Work on the Southern Pacific Com
pany's bay shore cut-off was begun in
South San Francisco yesterday morn-
Ing:. A large gang of men was sent to
the quarry three miles east of camp
No. 1. where the necessary material is
to be taken out for the new line, which
will diverge from the present main line
at South San Francisco station and ex
fend in a southeasterly direction, cross
ing: the slough near the packing-houses
of the Western Meat Company at Point
San Bruno. Some heavy work is to bo
done in that locality, and in conse
quence a complete construction outfit
is to be installed there.
The tunnels to be bored will b* double
tracked." They are to be five Jn num
ber. Tunnel No. 1. east of South San
Francisco, will be about 5000 feet in
length and will be brick-arched, a con
tract for 100.000.000 brick having been
awarded. The building of the cut-off
will come as a relief to the present sys
tem, particularly in that it will over
come several steep grades in the neigh
borhood of the Mission.

XEW YORK. Oct. 26.â Dealings in stocks
to-dAy were not up to yesterday's record, . but
the dimensions and the astonishing breadth
and \-ariety of tbÂ« market were well main
tained. TbÂ« list was subjected to a pretty
cÂ«i.rching liquidation and severe inroads upon
prices resulted, but the benefit to the market's
health by this process began to be shown in
the latter part of the day, when there were
ruhstanti&l recoveries from the low level. The
reactionary course of the market was largely
due to technical causes. As much of tbe
recent buying has been due wholly to the fact
that prices were moving up and were ex
jwcted to continue to do eo, yesterday's dem
onstration that tbe advance was checked ' in
duced selling. Yesterday's performance in
Union Pacific and the lnadequateness of the
Xicwe to explain it awakened uneasiness owing
to the half -hysterical character of the move
ment and its revelation of the emotional na
ture of very large operations in the market.
The psychological state which prompts 'an in
definite buying 1Â« quickly altered by a simple
change in the direction of prices, and consid
erations of Intrinsic value have no force to
prevent this change. There iÂ« tbe additional
ffcdor of forced cale en the reaction by the
tilplng out of narrow margins and the uncov
ering of stop-loss orders placed below the
market and which are always in usual vol
ume after a volatile rise in prices. All these
forces operated in causing the . weakness to
day. But consideration was also given to-day
to the more material factors or tbe disap
pointing quarterly statement of the United
States Etecl Corporation, the Irritating ten
sion between Russia and Great Britain and
the prosi>ect of a creditable gold export move
ment. It is enough to indicate the disappoint
ment of tbe highly speculative element with
thÂ« United grates fiteel report to know that
reports were circulated on the Stock Exchange
j-escerday that the â¢ quarterly- net earnings
would amount to 8,23.000.000. While' the |18,
7ZÂ»3,!C2 reported was near the expectation in
more reasonable and well-informed quarters,
the low figure of the unfilled orders on hand
was a shock to the sanguine feeling , which
has grown up regarding the revival in the steel
industry, and the additional Informal assur
ances riven by. the chairman of the board of
the further expansion in orders slnoe tbe turn
of the quarter proved insufficient to overcome
thi* wntlment. Selling. from tbe steel crnters
tr.4 from the We#t was very large, bota of
the United States Steel stocks and the Pa
Â¦:Â¦!Â¦. end Pennsylvania cbowÂ«d the usual
' Â¦Â¦ r? 1 1 '.>:>â¢ with United States . Steel. London
t'.so sold freely here. While, it 'was believed
that the scuteness of the Anp-lo-Rusaian crisis
tvÂ£* over for the present? tbe situation
Â«-af felt to bÂ« dangerous and liable to some
explosive episode which might throw it out
cf the r*J< cf the diplomatists to control.
Veiled intimations of undisclosed develop
r er.li in the situation played Â¦ a part in the
rriarktt. The report that arrangements â¢ bad

Eiitnr, & Co. yesterday said:
STOCKSâ The Etock market is upsetting the
calculations of the most steadfast bulls cf
the past six months, and the beÂ£t judges agree
to-night th&t Its extraordinary advance is due
to the enormous buying of the public Fcr,
irhlle soir.e -critic* *lill contend that the up
ward movement has* been entirely profes
sional, the enlargement ' In commission -house
oesiness during October has been such that
there Is no question that outsiders are In con
trol temporarily, at least, of the epeculatlve
situation. In ehort. the cliques and pools are
larrely out of stocks which they carried for
oVer a year, but which are now in the hands
of the public. The rapid advance which has
been sent; on for "about four months to a
iaxge extent baa discounted the improved con
ditions. Etocks which vet* accumulated dur
lcj: the decline of the past year and a half
fcave been coznint out of atrons boxes very
rree'.y during the past week and passing into
the hands of speculator* at large. The volume
of epecuiatlve business. &Â« indicated by the
?ery large daily trading, makes a very pood
market tor thcee securities. In ay opinion
.St ;e Just a question of time when the weight
of these selling will be felt by the various
Els now operating In the market. The ap
Â»ching election day. while the remits Â«eem
ured. will tend to ihake holders of stocks
â¢oujbt on this advance timid, and some llould
fctton aa a result is likely to be in evidence.
Stocks and Business.
Tbe New Tork circular of Henry Clews
"The speculative s! tuition haa not yet reach
Â»d the danger point, but prices are now so high
that the temptations to take profits are Â«nor
teous. *nd are of course increased with every
â¢dvance. The public is coming into the mar-
Jtet- with increasing force daily and as the
hig interests are not likely to" permit any
â¢erious reaction the prospects are for an ex
cellent trading market during the next few
*-e*ka. One of the influential elements in the
Â¦ituatltm is that leading bankers have lm
rcrtaut deals and new flotations In prospect.
As a weak market would interfere with, each
plans, these parties cannot well afford to per
mit any serious decline, and would probably
â¢neourace a bull market wrthin reasonable
lln.it?. On their tide is the continued im-
XTt.verr.ent in business, also ease In the money
market. Railroad managers who are In an
edvantajreous position for looking ahead are
, c0nf.1Jer.Uy expecting a heavy traffic this fall
and winter: Â«o confident, in fact that they
â¢tre pre?ficg for deliveries of new can and
rlacinp additional orders for others In order to
t* ready for the expected trade revival..
Â¦Uhfcln a short period our railroads have
Tl&.c<-} orders for 20.000 new freight cars In
the iron trade the rocevery haa been remark
able, at .times almost running into m. buyers'
panic, eo complete has been the change Con
tracts for nearly 200.000 tons of plglron have
been placed during the last few days at an
advance of $1 . per ton. Other branches cf
tbe iron trade are sharing in the rivival. and
copper, too. it in large demand at advancing
prices. The business outlook in nearly all
respects is satisfactory, and if the forward
movement can bo kept within the lines of
moderation present prosperity may bÂ« con
tinued indefinitely. Nothing could injure its
j*TmaiKnee more than a 'boom.'
. ' 'Conditions In the etock market are thus

Henry Milton must die on the scaf
fold at San Quentin. according to a
decision rendered yeste'rday by the
Supreme Court The murderer ap
pealed to the State's highest tribunal
on the ground that Â¦ the -triar court had
erred in refusing to Instruct^hfjury
not to find the defendant t"*"^ Â°*
murder In the first degree unless .it
was shown that the crime had been
premeditated. The Justicea find that
no error was made and the sentence of
death is affirmed.
Milton, alias. Henry Lupton..mis
spent nearly forty years In criminal
pursuits. His hair Is splashed with
silver and his face Is earned with
wrinkles. The gallows will not rob
him of y many years of life. _
The crime for which he must suffer
death was committed April 14. 1903.
James Gilleece, an aged saloon-keeper,
was about to enter his home at 16
Eleventh street when he was confront
ed by a footpad who demanded nls
money. The unfortunate victim at
tempted to pass and when his way was
barred grappled with the robber.
During the struggle the footpad shot
Gilleece through the thigh; Police Of
ficers Keohane and Slattery heard the
shot and rushed to the scene Just in
time to catch the robber as he.com
pleted rifling the pockets of â¢ his vic-
At the station the criminal was Iden
tified as Milton, who had served sev
eral terms In i different penitentiaries.
Gilleece lived for- six weeks, but the
shock combined with an attack, of
blood poisoning In the wound finally
caused his death. Milton got $2 50
by the deed for .which he must die.
_ H. E. Elliott, a cousin of Senator For
aker of Ohio, was : arrested last night
by DetectiveEd Gibson on a charge of
felony embezzlement which Is alleged
to have, taken place nearly /three years
ago. 'Elliott says that the charge has
arisen through enmity Incurred against
him in a recent divorce suit instituted
by his wife. He denies that he ever
stole any money and claims that noth
ing can be proved against him.
-.' The complaining witness against the
prisoner is John Carson of Ithe firm of
Yates & CoJ, 117 Market , street; dealers
in oils and paints. The crime is alleged
to have .been the misappropriation of
$171 which Elliott is said to have col
lected while . In the Yates Company's
employ, as a collector." Just why âÂ¦ the
firm waited nearly three years to pre
fer the charge against Elliott, "who has
been for the most time in this city,
is not known.
Elliott attributes the preferring of
the charge to spitework. He is now em
ployed : as a drummer, by. a rival firm
of the -Yates Company," the J. J. Ad
ams Company of New -York, also paint
dealers. I He says that he ; reprimanded
his wife some time. ago about her con
nection with a .United States Secret
Service agent Â¦ named Burns, and : that
she became wrathy and sued, him for
divorce. He alleges that when he
fought the suit he . incurred the wrath
of his wife.' Burns and Charles New
man, proprietor of ;' the yRuss House",
whose name was also mentioned in con
nection with the proceedings.

Mr. , Etter, was at the rooms "of the
California State Board of Trade yes
terday and left there,' as a part of the
permanent exhibit, several Jars of the
new gooseberry. The grower pursues
practically the same methods as Lu
ther Burbank,- the California wizard
of horticulture. He has a large tract
of land upon which he is making in
teresting experiments in differentiat
ing fruits and vegetables with the aim
of producing something new and- more
valuable than the original types.
California has another propagator
of new species of vegetation. He . is
Albert Etter of Humboldt County.. He
has produced a gooseberry that is
far removed from the ordinary goose
berry. In the first place Mr. Etter
has eliminated the seed from the
gooseberry, which up to the present
time has always been full of seeds. In
the next place Mr. Etter's gooseberry
has been provided with a thin skin
instead of a tough one, such as has
always covered that sort of growth.
Then again, the acid has been moder
ated. ','Â¦'Â¦-'Â¦ J

PRETTY BOOTHS ATTRACT

The next matter to claim the at
tention of the Grand Jury will be the
case 'of the Election- Commissioners,
over whom there has been ' much see
sawing. ;
; "We will : certainly present an ac
cusation . against the Commissioners
to-morrow," Â¦: said a Juror yesterday.
"Welhave been advised that it Is not
necessary to have twelve votes , to di
rect the District Attorney to proceed
against" public 'officers ' to remove
them from office. By a majority, vote,
and that is already assured, â¢ we 'can
1 Inspector .Fitrsimmons of .the Public
Works Department will 'be called on
to explain why he stopped work at
the theater when it wa3 being fit
ter up.
MORRIS LEVY OX THE TRACK.
As a sequel to the Ruef. -charges the
Grand Jury / has turned - its attention
to reports concerning Morris . , Levy's
connection with the saloon adjoining
the : theater.*- Manager W. Z. Tiffany
of the showhouse is a half, owner of
the saloon, and Levy,' who is secretary
to the Public Works Board, is said - to
have sought to branch out in; the sa
loon business now that promoting of
fights is ; rather slow.
It is admitted that Levy tried to
purchase an interest in the saloon, but
that the deal fell through because of
the death of John Sroufe, partner ' and
father-in-law j or* Tiffany. : So . the- ex
planation' to the Grand Jury this aft
ernoon'will be that Levy does not own
any interest in the saloon whatever.
John F. Merrill of, Holbrook; Merrill
& Stetson is the executor of the Sroufe
estate, and a ' su bpena was served on
him yesterday. ;
The session, of the Grand Jury this
afternoon promises to be full of in
teresting â¢ developments. : The foreman
and the secretary have been bending
.their -energies , to have an attendance
of all the nineteen members, and each
faction is expected to muster its
strength.
The charge' that Abe Ruef made use
of his influence with the Board of Pub
lic Works -,to compel ; the company
owning ; the . 10-cent : showhouse known
as the Baldwin Theater to give up 40
percent of Its stock to him will be
taken up again.' The witnesses that
have been subpenaed in this case are
W. S. Leake, Theodore Rothchild,
Charles . Leonhardt Jr., Herbert
Schmitz and Inspector Fltzslmmons.
Leake was one of the promoters of
the theater, Â¦ but sold out his. Interest
when Ruef became a "stockholder, be
ing forced to do so, it is alleged, by
the pressure the latter was able Â»to
bring to bear. No incriminating evi
dence was adduced against Ruef . at
the last : hearing, and it remains for
the testimony to-day to make out a
case, if one is to be made
Rothchild held the stock owned by
lieonhardt and participated in the
meetings of the directors. Leonhardt
will be re-examined In regard to : a
statement made at the meeting of the
Grand Jury last Thursday that pres
sure was exerted from some quarter he
did-not name to; obtain a block of
stock in the company.
â¢ Herbert Schmitz, president of the
Board of Public Works, Is to be grill
ed still further as to his official deal
ings with the Baldwin Theater, par
ticularly as to the enforcement of reg
ulations in building and also to ex
plain why -the company has not paid
its license. ff B f* l 'i g tlffP'ifl l irtffBWiill > WilÂ¥'l l
