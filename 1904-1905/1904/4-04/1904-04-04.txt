and much eurorise was occasioned by
the reappearance of Juan Colorado,
who was reported to have been killed
several months ago by Rurales. A
large reward was offered for his cap

him a hiding place where it is almost
impossible for the troops to overtake
him.
EL PASO, Texas, April 3. â Pros
pectors returning here from the Sierra
Madres of Mexico bring the story of
another raid by the bandit Juan Colo
rado and his company of cut- throats.
The outlaws swooped down upon the
Mormon village of Don Felipe, which
occupies a fertile valley 'traversed by
the Rio Aros, and looted several
rancnes, carrying off three Mormon
woman who were the wives of a prom
inent elder of the colony.
The raiders fled into the mountains
and obtained a start of five hours
ahead of the Mexical Rurales and a
Mormon posse who pursued them. The
avengers followed the trail almost two
days and tracked the fugitives to their
main camp, high up in the Sierras.
Plans were made for an attack upon
the camp to rescue the women, but
the bandits escaped in the night,
leaving the women behind in a cave
which was fitted up as a dwelling
place and had evidently been used as
a rendezvous by the outlaws.
The women were recovered un
harmed and a search of the cavern re
vealed a number of silver bars which
had been stolen from pack trains. These
barn were valued at several thousand
dollars. The Mormons abandoned pur
suit of tlip outlaws After recovering the
women, but the Rurales continued the
chase.

TACOMA,? April 3. â Oriental ad
vices received to-day contain details
of the loss of the German steamship
Deuteros, which was wrecked on the
rocks in Paracels Straits in February,
while en route from Saigon to Hong
kong. One passenger had a presenti
ment of approaching danger and
asked||he captain to exercise care in
passing through the narrow channel
between .the islands. The captain
laughed and declared that there was
no danger. Soon after the steamer
struck the rocks, grinding her hull for
a long, distance on the rpugh bottom.
Captain Schmidt made a hasty ex
amination which showed eighteen feet
of water In the ' hold and the vessel
sinking fast. Boats were instantly
lowered, the. Chinese crew taking pos
session of the first two despite the ef
forts of the officers ! to quiet them.
Seventeen passengers . and the officers
went into later boats,:,' the' captain be
ing last to leave the. [steamer. The
captain's boat returned and secured
provisions, rockets fand oil and the
ship's books. -^ The.; boats were then
tied together to , prevent them sepa
rating in high seas then running.
The Deuteros got off the rocks and
drifted down the channel after the
boats, but her lights disappeared
in the early morning, indicating 'that
she had sunk. After drifting thirty
hours a light was seen approaching
and three rockets were fired. Two
failed, but the third went into the air.
In three minutes it was answered and
the Dutch steamer Laertes, bound for
Saigon, picked up the castaways. By
Captain Schmidt's good management
every soul was saved. â¢ Â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Two men, masked with handker
chiefs, entered and robbed the saloon
and grocery of J. H. O'Brien, 471
Shotwell street, about 10 o'clock last
ntgfit.
O'Brien and two customers were j in
the barroom when two robbers, one
wearing a red handkerchief and the
other a white one over his face, entered
and, at the. points of revolvers, ordered
the crowd to throw up their hands.
James O'Callahan, one of the" cus
tomers, was rather deliberate in rais
ing his hands, whereupon, one of the
robbers fired at him. The shtft missed,
however, and the thief struck O'Calla
han on the head with the butt end of
his revolver, knocking him to the floor.
Dan Ford and O'Brien were searched
and a gold watch and $4 in coin taken
from Ford. O'Brien had no money on
his person. The thugs next robbed the
till, from which they got $5 or $6.
As soon as the thieves had left the
saloon O'Brien fan for his revolver,
which he usually keeps behind the bar.
He was unable to find it there, but
later located it in his room behind the
store.
As soon as he found his revolver,
O'Brien ran out Into the street and fired
several shots in the air. '
In less than ten minutes a patrol
wagon, carrying a squad of police from
the Mission station, was on the spot,
but the culprits had made good their
escape. ' \ Â£
Detectives Fitzgerafd, Dinan and
Wren were detailed on the case, but as
yet no arrests have been made.
O'Callahan's injuries are slight.
The only countries now enjoying the
privileges which Embassador McCor

United States are Germany, Greece,

6T. PETERSBURG, April 3,âEm
bassador McCormick is negotiating
â¢with the Foreign Office for a treaty
with Russia which will give to United
States corporations the right to sue in
Russian courts and to Russian corpor
ations the right to Bue in courts of the
United States. Under the Russian law
United States corporations can be sued
but cannot sue In the courts of the
empire^ This haa caused United States
firms great annoyance as well as losses
In the past. In addition the Embassa
â¢dor hopes to secure in the treaty a
broad clause which will give to the
United States corporations all privi
leges In whatever character now enjoy

Although there are difficulties in the
way of accomplishing: the desired re

E. H. Harriman it preparing to
abolish the local offices of the Union
Pacific Company by consolidating
them with those of the Southern Pa
cific* It is reported on good author
ity that - Harrimah would have con
solidated the offices several months
ago when he was here, and in fact
he seriously considered the matter
until he learned that, the Union Pa
cific Company's lease- in the Masonic
Temple has still two years to run and
it was not certain whether a : change
would mean a loss to the company.
It is now reported that he has given
instructions to his officials here to en
deavor to llnd some one who will take
the remaining portion of the lease off
his hands, and that when they succeed
an order merging the -Union Pacific
passenger and freight offices into the
local agencies of the Southern Pacific
Company will immediately follow. -In
that event the last of the Union Pa
cific Company's agencies on this coast
will have disappeared.
Several years ago Harriman in
timated his intention ot closing 1 the
local office of the Union Pacific Com
pany, but the proposition brought a
hurried protest from other lines on
the ground that such a move would
give the company as well as the
Southern Pacific ; Company , an unfair
advantage in the scramble for passen
ger traffic in that it would at once cre
ate for the Union Pacific ; Company
about two thousand new agencies on
.the coast, for every station along the
Southern Pacific j lines would | immedi
ately become the representative of the
other Harriman - line. ; It is evident
that Harriman . had this idea in view
at the time, but only refrained from
carrying it out because | of i threatened
antagonism- from the Gould lines.
Now that-Gould'is looking coastward.
notwithstanding .his assertions to the
contrary, Harriman 'Â¦ feels that he can
make the change and the local agents
of the Union Pacific .Company are
looking anxiously/ for, an order de
claring their offices; on' Montgomery
street out of business.

"Although I left the service of the
Northern -Pacific with deep regret,"
said he yesterday, "I come to San Fran
cisco feeling that I will enjoy the
friendship and the confidence of the
people here. I am not a stranger in
California. I have often visited the
State, understand its conditions fairly
w"ell and have always been an admirer
of its progressive methods. As to my
future connection with the Southern
"Pacific Company, I can say little at
this time, further than that I purpose
to follow as closely as possible the pol
icy of my esteemed predecessor."
Charles Fee f s interest in California
developed some years ago as a result
of his family's frequent visits here in
search of health, and he has never
missed an opportunity of coming West
himself./ As a passenger traffic man he
ranks among the foremost in this coun
try, haying had an experience in this
business in the Northern Pacific Com
pany's territory extending over a pe
riod of twenty-six years. He went to
the Northern Pacific from the Michi
gan Central in 1877, when the former
road had less than 400 miles of line,
part of which was leased, and after
six years' service as secretary to H. E.
Sargent he became the general pas
senger agent of the road, entering on
his duties just as the Jine was becom
ing a transcontinental" route. To him
fell the arduous work of framing poli
cies, making traffic connections and
establishing various systems for the
future suc<^ssful operation of the big
road. For rXpÂ»^.a year his time was al
most etitlrelj^siVotetf'to this Important
work and it -resulted In building up a
business the eciual- of which was en
joyed by few roads of a similar size in
this country. That he is a clever tutor
in the traffic business is suggested by
the large number of prominent pas
senger traffic men. who served un
der him and after graduated out of the
Northern Pacific service to higher po
sitions with other roads. Among these
may be mentioned J. C. Pond, general
passenger acent of the Wisconsin Cen
tral; B. N. Austin, general passenger
agent of the Baltimore and Ohio; A.
L. Craig of the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company, and C; E. Stone,
assistant general passenger agent of
the Great Northern.
Charles S. . Fee, former general pas
senger agent of the Northern Pacific
Railroad' and who succeeds E. O. Mc-
Cormick as passenger \ traffic manager
of the Southern Pacific Company, ar
rived from St. Paul yesterday and is
registered at the Palace Hotel. He will
enter, upon his duties at the railroad
building this morning. It was gener
ally expected that Fee would be ac
companied to the coast bv one or> more
of his former" assistants, for it is a cus
tom of prominent railroad officials,
when they make a change from one
road to another, to take several of
their confidential men with them, but
he stated yesterday that he had decid
ed on no* changes, a bit of information
that will greatly relieve the anxiety
prevailing in the passenger department
of the Southern Pacific Company.

There is much speculation upon the
identity of the. president of the Na
tional Federation. Mrs. Robert J.
Burdette of Los Angeles and Mrs.
Platt Decker of Colorado are. to all
appearances, leading the race, with
the California clubs boosting the Cali
fornia candidate â by a strange di
version from most political doings.
However, the Knockers are, by the
slow process of absorbtion. becoming
Boosters, and who knows but Cali
fornia may yet redeem her national
reputation for "knockery." And the
women are leading.

Joseph F. Smith in his opening, speech
expressed gratification at the large at

Apostle Francis M. j Lyman in the
course of his remarks said:
"We are here that we may have pos

In speaking of the doctrine of divine

. "When President Smith stands up to
speak we know God is with him. We
know that the Lord speaks through
that man. It is the mind of the Lord,
the purpose of the Lord."

REDDING, April 3.â Despite the con
trary reports that have been sent out
from Redding, not a single arrest has
yet been made In connection with the
hold-up of the Oregon express Thurs
day night at Copley. William Ahern,
the railroad detective, said to-night:
"No arrests have yet been made. The
people seem to expect that w-e must
capture the bandits right away â if not
to-day, at least to-morrow. They for
get that the robbers probably planned
their escape for a month before holding
up the train. We can't turn around in
a day or two and uncover their tracks,
especially when we have absolutely
nothing to work on."
The work being done by the officials
now is principally that of the detec
tives, whose number was increased to
day by J. J. White of San Francisco,
representing Wells, Fargo & Co. Sher
iff Richardson is aiding them in every
way possible, but feels that the ser
vices of himself and his force will be
more in demand when the bandits are
located than at present. Since the
Kennett clew of yesterday resulted in
the suspects proving a complete alibi,
the situation as regards the apprehen
sion of the robbers is as dark as It was
on the morning subsequent to the kill
ing of Messenger O'Neil. The detec
tives are following up every possible
clew that Is brought to their attention.
None is considered insignificant.

The Russ says that Great Britain
took a leaf out of Japan's book on the
way to open hostilities by attacking
the Tibetans without a declaration of
war. The Novoe Vreyma says:
"The American millionaires have
changed the destinies of India. Since
Lord Curzon became Lord Kitchener's
brother-in-law their personalities seem
to have been merged. Curzon spoke
with the words of Kitchener on the
glacis theory and . Kitchener adopted
the policy of. Curzon in sending an al
leged diplomatic mission, into Tibet.
The glacis theory is all right so long
as it has to do with unarmed foes."
The Bourse Gazette openly suggests
that King Edward is planning an en
tente between Great Britain and Russia
and then says:
"There is no need for alarm. We
have been accustomed since the days
of Disraeli and SalisbuVy to such veiled
threats (referring- to Lord Curzon's
speech). Indian Secretary Brodrick's
announcement of big guns for India
has broken no bones, nor is any one
frightened by the forthcoming British
naval demonstration in the Mediterran
ean. The fact is that the British for
eign policy is now in higher hands than
Lord Curzon's and we all know that a
sincere, peaceful and loyal influence is
being exerted by King Edward. There
is no longer doubt of British neutral
ity, and there is no reason for appre
hension regarding the promise of a
friendly agreeme-nt with Russia con-'
cerning Tibet. We are only curious to
see how Great Britain will explain
armed aggression within a Chinese
province."
LONDON, April 4.â Candler, the cor
respondent of the Daily Mail, who was
wounded during the fighting between
the British and the Tibetans at Guru
on March 31, and whose left hand has
been amputated, thus describes the at
tack upon him:
"I was watching the Tibetans being
disarmed, when I was attacked by a
swordsman. This was before a shot
had been fired. The onslaught was too
sudden for me to draw my revolver. I
caught the Tibetan around the knees
and thretv him, but I was > myself
dragged down and in trying to rise
was cut down by several swordsmen.
These were eventually shot."

WEHAIWEI. Aoril 2. â The situ
ation at present appears to be as fol
lows: As regards the. land forces.
General Kuroki's army is now in a po
sition to attempt to force the passage
of the Yalu whenever he may elect to
strike, but it would seem that, having
secured the necessary strategic posi
tion, he is awaiting the development
of the second Japanese mobilization
before a decisive move. This develop
ment has already begun, but it is not
possible to say where until the blow
has actually fallen.
In the meantime the Japanese and
Russian outposts are constantly in
touch along the line of the Cheng
cheng, but as a rule they do not come
into serious conflict, though one or two
sharp affairs are reported, in w T hich
the honors appear to be .equally
divided. The country in which the
troops are now operating has been
studied with a view to rendering the
operations of the Cossacks less val
uable than those of well-trained in
fantry.
One force of 103,000 troops has been
landed opposite Takushan, in Southern
Manchuria, and is marching north and
northwest. Another army of 40,000
men was landed in Northwestern Korea
and is marching toward the Yalu River.
A third force, whose number , 13 un
known, has been disembarked in
Northern Korea- and is marching to
the west. It is supposed another force
will attack Newchwang from the south
west, and news of an engagement is
daily expected.
The ice on the Yalu River is thaw
ing Sand the Russians are slowly retir r
ing northward. Good authorities here
estimate .the total Russian force in
Manchuria at 290,000 men, tfut this
probably is an excessive estimate.
SHANGHAI, April 3.â It Is credibly
reported here that the Japanese are
operating, in an irregular, , lozenge
shaped area, whose corners are intend
ed to be Antung, Newchwang, Kirin
and Vladivostok. : vV'
JAPAN HAS FOUR ARMIES.
LONDON. April 4.â The correspond
ent of the Times at Newchwang under
yesterday's date says that, the Russian
gunboat at Sivoutch failed three times
in attempting to leave the dock. " He
says that the British residents at New
chwang are satisfied that the depart
ure of the British warship Espiegle
will be indefinitely delayed.
A correspondent of the Morning Post
at Yinkow says that the position there
is daily becoming stronger. A fort
night ago the Japanese could have
landed with comparative ease, while
now they would experience great dif
ficulty.
The correpondent says he has re
ceived trustworthy information that
the concentration of troops along the
railway has been so rapid that it is
now impossible for the Japanese to
carry the war into Manchuria with
any hope of success, and that the most
they can do is to isolate Port Arthur
and possibly Vladivostok. ;
The statement that the captain of
the Russian cruiser Boyarin is to be
court-martialed is regarded ns con
firming the report that the vessel wai
blown up by a mine.
"Rumors are current in high circles
of fresh dissensions between Viceroy
Alexieff and General Kuropatkin. It
is alleged that the Viceroy wants his
views on the subject of the quickest
way of ridding the country of Japanese
adopted, whereas General Kuropatkin
insists on retaining some responsi
bility for the conception and execution
of military operations. There is reason
to believe that General Kuropatkin will
be left free, Viceroy Alexieff being too
judicious to create trouble on account
of a mere supposed slight."
YINKOW WELL DEFENDED.

PARIS, April 4.â The St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Figaro says that
Russia has ordered 250 cannon in Eng
land for the Manchurian army. He
adds that the Tenth and Seventeenth
army corps will not start for the seat
of war before the end of the ntonth.
I passed within a clear view of the
Port Arthur entrance yesterday morn
ing. I could distinguish no smoke and
met no Russian vessels outside. This,
however, is not conclusive of anything.
Considerable fogs' are frequent . over
these seas, and it is possible that under
their cover Admiral Makaroff will at
tempt to put into practice his own
theories of destroyer tactics. He still
possess eleven seaworthy vessels of
this class.
RUSSIA BUYING CANNON.
Of the naval situation it is not easy
to give a correct estimate, as I do not
know whether the whole Russian
squadron was in Port Arthur last Sun
day when the Japanese sank the mer
chantmen, and, if it was, whether the
harbor was successfully blocked.
Those who participated in the attack
think that it was. but Admiral Togo
expresses a doubt, though he attaches
no blame to any one, simply remark
ing that, if the channel is open, the
reason is that the number of ships sunk
was not sufficient.
ing good progress In improving roads
and until next winter the land army
will not have to experience such cold
as was endured ] by General Imoye's
army in the march to seize Pingyang.
Latest trustworthy reports show that
the main Russian concentration is on
the line from Liaoyang to Haicheng,
south of ' Mukden, and that arrivals
from the North and depletions from
the Port Arthur garrison are concen
trated there at a convenient point for
dispatch to the Yalu. There is also a
mobile force in readiness to meet any
other threatened Japanese advance or
landings.
NAVAL STATUS OBSCURE.
Before the port was drawn up the en
tire Black Sea fleet, and behind it lay
the city in holiday garb. Admiral
Skrydloff, commander-in-chlef of the
fleet, welcomed the survivors, and at
the Admiralty Cathedral removed from
his breast the Order of St. George and
pinned it upon the breast of Captain
Stepanoft of the Variag, who had seen
service under him. Captain Stepan
off and his crew have been ordered to
St. Petersburg, and the townsmen route
have invited them to stop off In order
that they, too, may show their appre
ciation of the sailors' brave conduct.
harbor all of the foreign ships helped
to move and attGTid to the wounded,
but the American warship merely sent
a doctor. This magnanimous action
we refused to take advantage of.
" 'A writer passing through the port
said he had heard that the American
embassies had denied I the foregoing
facts, but I read the report of one of
the commanders, wherein the virtues
of the American captain were clearly
stated in all their beauty.
" 'When our unfortunate ships * re
turned to the inner roadstead the Jap
anese warships signaled to the foreign
warships to get out of the way. By
way of an ans.wer to this brazen signal
the commander of the British warship
signaled that if the Russians were at
tacked in the inner, harbor he would be
compelled to fire upon . the Japanese.
We Russians owe a deep debt of grat
itude to this honest Englishman.' "
SEBASTOPOL, April 13.â The , sur
vivors of the Variag and : Koreitz,
which vessels were destroyed in Che
mulpo harbor, arrived here to-day and
received ovations as enthusiastic as
those with which they were greeted at
Odessa.

Preparations are proceeding for the
Easter festivities. Easter, in Russia, is
the greatest holiday of the year, and Is
celebrated with"* feasting and . merri
ment throughout the empire. The floral
displays in the churches on Easter
probably .will be the most gorgeous in
Europe.
The imperial potteries, a short dis
tance from St. PetersBurg. are manu
facturing'tens of thousands of china
eggs, which will be, distributed by the
Czar 'and Empress among the people.
If the Japanese wish to make a coup,
the average Russian. believes they will
attempt it on Easter morning, "when
the sailors at Port Arthur are feasting.
Those who know Vice Admiral'Makar
off rand General Â« Kuropatkin.' however,"
say that <f this time is chosen' the Jap
anese will reckon without their t hosts.
While the authorities have taken pre
cautionary measures, they seem to be
convinced that no re: 1 serious move
ment will occur to discredit Russia
in this time of war, and declare the
internal situation to be exceptionally
good, the disaffected elements being un
able to make headway against the deep
feeling of patriotism manifested by the
people. Government advices are to the
effect that the so-called reformers,
Radicals and Socialists, are losing in
stead of gaining ground in consequence
of the war.
In this connection attention is called
to the great enthusiasm with which
the survivors of the Variag and Koreitz
were greeted at- Odessa and the tele
grams of- welcome '.which poured in
from all parts of; Â¦ ' ." .
Among intelligent Jews the feqling is
that there is now presented an oppor
tunity to show the world that they
are friends, not enemies, of their na
tive land. Such ] an influential Jewish
organ as the Novosti denounces as foul
slander the statement that the Jews
are not loyally supporting the Govern
ment.
The deep religious nature of the Rus
sian people was illustrated last night,
when the peasant fairs and festivities
which have been in progress during
palm week ended, and the people began
to practice the rigorous abstention
with which members of the orthodox
church observe the last week in Lent".
As if by magic the peasants' booths on
the principal boulevards disappeared,
and pavements which for a week have
been crowded to the gutters with
laughing and chatting peasants, buy
ing all kinds of knicknacks, reverently
saluting the cheap prints of their rul
ers and evincing special interest in the
colored lithographs depicting war
scenes in which the Russians were al
ways triumphant, suddenly became de
serted. The churches, with their mag
nificent Interiors ablaze with lighted
tapers, were thronged with devout
worshipers. All of the theaters and
places of amusement were closed, and
even the music in the restaurants was
suspended. From Friday next to the
Russian Easter every, orthodox Rus
sian, from the Emperor down to the
humblest subject, will fast in the most
rigorous manner, partaking of bread
and water only. .
STRICT OBSERVANCE OF LENT.
The Czar has strictly observed Lent.
His table is meager, his amusements
fewer and his work, of course, far
greater. Except for one appearance at
the theater his sole amusement has
been drlv^ns about the capital, usually
with the Czarina on bright afternoons.
He goes about absolutely unguarded,
in a modest carriage, and but for the
attendance of the Prefect of Police, in
a much more gorgeous turnout, several
hundred feet behind him. and the mar
velous way in which streets are
cleared, an ordinary observer would
not know that the Czar . was passing.
He finds recreation, also, in walking in
the garden of the Winter Palace. .:Â¦
The Empress Dowager is frequently
seen on the streets. She is very popu
lar and graciously nods to both sides
as her carriage, with her gigantic Cos
sack footmen, sweeps by. Â¦
Not only have the newspapers been
warned, under .threat of severe penal
ty, against violation of the order
against - the publication of articles
which might inflame race hatred, but
the civil and military authorities in
the districts which might be affected
have Issued warnings threatening of
fenders with heavy fines and imprison
ment. Governor Ussourousoft! ot
Kishenpv and Governor Kaulbars of
Odessa are strong, capable men, in
whom the Government Imposes Im
plicit confidence. .
REFORMERS LOSING GROUND.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 3.â Reports
received by the Ministry of the In
terior indicate' that the precautionary
measures taken to prevent anti-Jewish
disturbances during Easter week, when
the ignorant arc easily aroused to a
sort of religious frenzy against the
Jews by the dissemination of false sto
ries regarding "blood atonement," will
result In the avoidance of ; serious
trouble. In ; spite of, the precautions,
however, it is considered possible there
may be attempts at rioting, but the
authorities may be relied upon to sup
press these with a strong hand. The
following private telegram was re
ceived to-day from Odessa:
--"Reports of ant I- Jewish disturbances,
which are common at Easter time,
cause more alarm than usual this year,
because of the occurrences last year.
The Jews here ire nervous, but the
authorities have' confidence In the Gov
ernor, as well as the commander in
chief x of the troops' in Southern Rus
sia. Under the circumstances, there
fore, anything like a serious disturb
ance is regarded as impossible.
"The official papers have published
strongly worded warnings and the city
is placarded with notices that all who
disturb the peace will be severely pun
ished." â¢

cither side of the roadway. A thousand
rodies were busy adding to the huge
piles of war material even as late as
yesterday.
. The v.eather is now milder and the
land campaign will soon be In full
fwing. The- Japanese fleet is still in
tact and continues watching Port Ar
thur. Doubtless the Mikado's sailors
â¢*\il! succeed in blocking the place on
the first occasion when the weather
favors them. Only a narrow passage

n.any of the twelve-inch guns out of
thr!r ships to arm the old and new
forts. The northern seas are safely
patrolled.

li seems reasonable to believe now
that the defenses of Port Arthur have
t>ron weakened and Its early capture
is to be expected.
It has now become known that at the
first attack on Port Arthur even more
c-.nspieuous bravery was shown by the
Japanese than was at first indicated.

SEOUL. April 3.â The Japanese troops
edvancing toward the Yalu River have
had another action, repulsing the Rus
sians smartly and only a score of Japa
nese being: wounded, in connection with
iiÂ»e engagement at Chongju, in North
.Korea, on March 28. Much fighting oc
curred in the town itself, which is a big
walled place. It is asserted here that
Forty Russians vr^re killed and wound
*"<J and that a number were captured.
The Japanese losses are given as
thirty.
Twenty of the men wounded in'thÂ«
skirmish at Kasan on March 26 em
l>arked on Thursday upon the hospital
Ship Kosai Maru. They are doing well.
The Russian losses on that occasion
vx-re estimated at fifty. It Is rumored
ui the same connection that a Japanese
major and thirty men were cut off and
captured.
A great body of Japanese troops has
moved northward from Chenampho and
other harbors used for the landing of
troops and stores, which latter are ar
riving at Chenampho in huge quanti
ties. A tramway has been laid from

A survivor of one of the Russian warships destroyed at Chemulpo supplies a new incident of the first
battle of the war. He says that after the Variag and the Koreltz retreated in a sinking* condition into the
harbor Japanasc Admiral Uriu signaled to the foreign warships there to get out of the way. The British
commander signaled back that he would turn his guns upon the Japanese wnrships if the latter fired a shot
in the harbor.
The Tanjjuard of Japan's army In Western Korea is now only forty miles south of WJJii, a town
which the Russians have fortified and made their headquarters east of the Yalu. * As the Japanese advance
the enemy continues to retreat toward the river. / * _
The Call's Seoul correspondent reports a series of engagements in the vicinity of Cliongju and gives
an estimate of losses, which indicates that the combats were of some importance.. Twenty Japanese who
were wounded at reÂ«Â«fwn have been received aboard a hospital ship.
From Santiago, Chile, comes a remarkable statement that will need strong verification before it can
be given credence. It Is asserted that a "commercial compact" has been negotiated 'with 'Japan, under. the
terms of which Toldo agrees to recornize the supremacy of Chile in South America, the republic In turn un
dertaking to induce Ecuador to cede to Japan the Gallapagos group of Islands. These Islands command the
Pacific entrance to Panama Bay and the inter-oceanic canal. Germany has long been hopeful of acquiring
them, but the United States Government has given Ecuador to understand that a sale of the Archipelago
to any European nation would not be recognized.
Equally astounding with the foregoing is the statement of The Call's St. Petersburg correspondent that
Germany and J>ancc have sold to the Russian Government six cruisers now under construction. That such
a breach of neutrality should be consummated seems incredible. -
The Czar's government is taking' extraordinary precautions to prevent a renewal of the anti-Jewish
outrages on the Russian Easter. It is not believed that â¢ religious demonstrations will be attempted, but the
authorities Intend not to be caught napping.

Dr. Abbott's first. Earle lecture Will
be given Tuesday evening in the First
Presbyterian Church. : There will be
four other lectures on the following
dates: Thursday, April 7; Friday,
April 9; Monday, April 11, and Tues
day, April 12. The general subject
of the course will be "Christianity
and the Church." ,
The Easter music at the First
Presbyterian ; Church to-day was
sung by an, augmented .choir. The
following numbers .Â¦".-, were rendered:;
Anthem, (double v quartet, t'They
Have "Taken,. , Away: My Lord";:
violin -solo,': Walter r Manchester; "con
tralto solo, ; ''Every, Flower .That Blos
soms": soprano solo, "The 'Dawn _â¢ of
Hope": nnthem,". with bass solo.;- "As
Sleep ! Takes Flight." The ; sermon was
Christ Is here to-day just as. well as eight
een centuries ago. ' It Is for us not so Imoorr
tant that he was raised up from the dead
eighteen centuries afro as It is. that he lives
to-day. He is the living Christ of this day
and age. Â¦ Â¦ ' .. *O
Death is simply the separation of the soul
from the body. Death, and resurrection are
synonymous terrrs. In one way we look at
the body, in another after, the spirit. This Is
not the on! v world for us. Christ told his
disciples that he was going to prepare the Way
for his people In another world. '"Where I am
there may ye be." He goes to prepare a place
for you. He says, "To-day thou Mia It be
with me," not to-morrow or on the day of
Judgment or some far oft. time, but to-day.
Death and resurrection, as I have xaid, are
synonymous. eimu!tu"neouÂ«. The spirit is al
ways there, even as It Is In sleep. No one
knows where the soul troes In sleep, yet it is
always there at -awakening. Sleep Is the par
able of death. Christ .demonstrated this when
he came bark to hin disciDles." It was an il
lustration that his body might be killed, but
not his spirit. He demonstrated that he lived
and triumphed over death. ' . ,
What we call death irt the simple passing
of the soul. The body In the Ground Is th-i
end of It. but the soul goes upward. When
we nlant a seed of wheat the seed does not
come up, but the stalk and the rest of It. A
child develops into youth, then manhood, then
declines with age and then drdps off. but God
glvps this new body and takes it to him.
The relations of the spirit to the body are
manlfent In three wayp. First, the body min
isters to the spirit: that is. the Inner life of
the spirit develops the bodily oreans. Second,
the bodily organs are the means of communi
cation betwetn different spirits, between men
and men. Third, after the body decays and is
cast oft by the spirit God .â¢_ receives ' It ' In an
other world. - :
The resurrection was not an extraordinary
event. It was simply an ordinary event that
was magnified in the eyes of the people who
did not know. The first orange that appeared
in the groves of Southern California is an ex
traordinary event, but when others follow in
myriads U Is quite an ordinary thing.
The flrst - impression of a man Is of his
physical belne. i Everything centers about his
physical organism. When this ducays he thinks
life has decayed, too. All througn the pagan
a;;es that was the impression that men had.
It was h common conceDtlou among the He
brews. Death to them was substantially the
end of all. Even In the book of Job we' find
that this opinion prevails.
But us men grew, after the teaching of
Christ, they cane to see that there was more
hope. It became the custom to keep the bodies
of their dead in tiepulchers and cellars so
that upon the day of promised resurrection
the spirit would know where to find the body.
They thought the soul, when l.t separated from
the body, went to some underground world and
remained until God came to raise' it.
Christ taucht the Immortal nature of the
soul. He taught that the body was merely
transitory, the mere. Instrument for the tran
sition of the spirit. He gave a striking illus
tration of thl* when he raised up Lazarus.
Martha thought the resurrection was to come
in the far future, but he paid. "I am the res
urrection and the life."
easier sermon tnis morning in me
First Congregational Church. There
was'a large concourse of people pres
ent eager to hear the eminent
preacher. In honor of the occasion,
the church was handsomely 'decor
ated with palms and fruit blossoms
and an augmented choir rendered an
excellent programme of sacred songs.
Dr. J. K. McLean, president of the
Pacific Theological .Seminary, pre
sented Dr. Abbott to the congrega
tion. Dr. Abbott led in the prayer
and for the sermon took his'text from
Corinthians 15:20: "Now is Christ
risen from the dead and become the
first fruit of them that slept." In
part, he said:

- "Of course many details have to be
considered before this annex is under
taken," said Mr.. Pollok last evening,
"and for that reason I would have pre
ferred that the -matter would not be
given any publicity, but you, may say
that the annex will be built under some
arrangement." ;Â¦ .
The .construction work will -not in
any way interfere with the business of
the hotel, for the wing will he built and
made ready for occupation before it is
connected by corridors with the present
building.
Manager Allan Pollok and the direct
ors of the St. Francis- Hotel are al
ready planning an annex to that new
hostelry. Although it has not yet been
determined whether the Crocker estate,
which owns the hotel and the frontage
on Powell street adjoining the St. Fran
cis, will build the annex or lease the
ground to the hotel company for pur
poses of Improvement, it was an
nounced yesterday that another wing
Â¦will be added to the new structure,
Â¦with the idea of giving the hotel an ad
ditional capacity of about 250 rooms.
The former site of the Cosmos Club
was purchased by the Crocker estate
shortly after its plans for the St. Fran
cis Hotel had been ordered, the idea
being to add to the hotel at some fu
ture date. In .fact, the hotel was de
signed so that an annex could be read
ily constructed, but It was not thought
at the time that It would be needed for
many years to come. The success of
the new hotel, however, has impressed
upon the management the immediate
need of more facilities, and no time has
been wasted in giving the matter con
sideration.
Manager Pollok admitted last even
ing that plans were under considera
tion, and he also confirmed a report to
the effect" that James Mahoney, the
well known builder, will leave for the
East in a few days for the purpose of
inspecting some of the modern hotels
now in course of construction and get
ting the latest suggestions in structural
art, with Che idea of applying them to
the addition of the St. Francis.
One of the problems now ,under con
sideration by the directors of the hotel
company concerns the most advantage
ous manner in which the space be
tween the present north wing and the
proposed new one may be used for a
driveway to facilitate the reception of
guests. The architects have suggested
that the space: be converted into a
glass covered court, through which en
trance to the present hotel and the new
portion can be gained by doorways sit
uated In line with the present corridor
that extends across the building.
The space adjoining, now occupied as
Manager Pollok's private office, will be
reconstructed into a shaft for the ac
commodation of two additional eleva
tors.

In speaking of the novel style of
architecture selected for the new
church, Rev. Dr. Brush said: ,
The edifice could not have been properly
erected in Gothic style without an increased
expenditure of $SOOO or $10,000. Now, no one
has a right to build beyond his means. Then,
too. Gothic style requires stone more than,
does the Grecian style. The cheaper one's
material, the simpler should be the lines of
structure. Of all abominations cheap adorn
ments are the worst, "and worst of all tn
church architecture. Simplicity in religion Is
even more vital than reverence; A building
covered with wooden towers, in imitation of
the great stone cathedrals, is a mockery and
travesty. "Our n*w church Is simple, honest
and exactly suited to the congregation.
The larger windows are installed to
the memory of Rev. Rodney L. Tabor
and Rev. E. Y. Garrette, deceased
pastors of the church; Mrs.. Haslett,

NOVEL ARCHITECTURE.'.
Rev. Frank S. Brush, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church, and who
has been untiring in his labors to house
his congregation in a home adequate
for its wants, thanked those who had
worked with him and urged them all
to follow up the good beginning and
never to relax their energies in pro
moting the interest of the church and
of religion.
The new edifice is 110 feet Jong and
63 feet wide. It is constructed entirely
of wood. The fourteen large stained
glass windows in the sides cover more
of the area than does the lumber In
the sides.
Rev. E. E. Baker o' the First Pres
byterian Church of Oakland, who
preached the dedicatory sermon, said
in part:
This is a religious home that I? an inspira
tion to me. a testimonial to the zeal and faith
of the pastor, officers and members of this con
gregation, a monument to Christianity and a
credit to Alameda. There is a similarity be
tween the family and the church. Both are
the main essentials of society, but one can
~et Jn a church what he cannot in a home.
It Is in the church where we come into touch
with God, where we reach out and touch the
hem of the Savior"B garment through the faith
In us. This home of religion is one that will
Inspire all who will come within its walls, and
I trust that its work in the cause of Christian
ity and humanity will increase as the years no
by. It starts on this Easter day with tha
blepsing; of God and the prayers of its mem
bers and others who believe that advancement
of the church means the advancement of so
ciety.
TESTIMONIAL TO ZEAL.
When the dedicatory exercises began
at 2:30 o'clock, the seating capacity of
the church, 800, was overtaxed and
many were provided with chairs in the

V.'ith the return of pleasant weather,
the local real estate market ha3 re
sumed its activity, and the dealers re
port large sales of residence property
during the last week. The all-absorb-l
ing' topic among real i .ate men at
present is the proposed bond issue and
its- probable effect upon Oakland realty.
The dealers agree that, although th9
pro-bond sentiment has not yet exerted
noticeable influence on the sale of local
real estate, that as summer advances,
and more homeseekers begin to coma
Into this city, the bond issue will be th-Â»
principal factor in the sale of Oakland
real estate.
Frank J. Woodward, president of tha
Oakland Real Estate Association, ex
presses the opinion that upon the result
of the coming bond election depends
the future of the Oakland realty mar
ket. Mr. Woodward said:
The result of the bond election will maka or
break the Oakland real estate market. It the
bonds are carried the future of the market iÂ»
assured, while, en the other hand, \' th*
bonds meet defeat at the pells values v. ;:i
gradually depreciate. During the last weeic
the volume of business in Oakland real estatv
has steadily increased. Tho ' pleasant weather
has had a most beneficial effect on the market,
enabling prospective investors to get around
and examine property, the result being an im
mediate increase in business. Amcrg the rnora
important sales recently made by us are t.i->
following: 'Â»

William J. Laymance of the Lay

very satisfactory and inquiries from streamers
through advertising more evident thar, ever
before.
The announcement made yesterday ' that tha
Santa Fe Railroad Company on and after
April 22 will route all Oakland freight an-i
passenger traffic direct is a great step for

terial effect upon real estate in this city.
The awakening of the commercial bodies of
Oakland, particularly noticeable in the mem
bership of the Oakland Board of Trade passing
the r,i.i> mark and the assurance of it reach

this body Is taking up the bond issue and
other important improvements, has created .*

Miss Engle is a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Fred Engle. who live eight miles
out from Stockton. A telegram was
sent to them telling them of the plight
of their daughter.
Mrs. Delanoy stated this evening that
Miss Engle was in her employ for four
months and that she always appeared
to be of a cheerful disposition. Her
employer did not know that the young
Â¦woman had any lover. Miss Engle left
The Delanoy home yesterday at noon
for Berkeley, and returned last night
at 11:30 o'clock.
'Miss Engle"s gentleman friend, to
whom she said she was engaged, is
Mr. Bulkley," asserted Mrs. McDonald
in relating to Mrs. Delanoy what she
knew of Miss Engle's heart affairs.
"She visited me yesterday in Berkeley
and also had a talk with her admirer.
I think. Before leaving for Alameda
fhe told me that he had informed her
that he could not marry her, as he was
engaged to a rich girl. This made her
very i*esr>ondent and was probably the
reason she tried to take her life."
According to Mrs. Lucy McDonald,
who is in the employ of Mrs. A. A-
Hutchins of 2624 Bancroft way. Berke
ley, and who is a close friend of Miss
Engle, the lattfcr was the sweetheart of
Lewis Bulkley. a student at the State
I'niversity, who had lodgings at the
Hutchins residence.
There was no name or address on the
epistle. In leaving open a closet door
in her room Miss Engle permitted some
ventilation, which prevented the gas
doing its deadly work as quickly as she
expected. Dr. T. P. Titdale. who was
Fummoned to attend the patient, found
her in a very weak condition, and to
night expressed the opinion that she
was in great danger of passing away.
Before turning on the gas and lying
down to die, as she planned, the young
woman wrote a note in German, which,
translated, reads:
Â¦ Life is not worth living. Do not be
angry."

OAKLAND, April 3. â John Bates,
a soldier connected with the Sixtieth
Coast Artillery, stationed at the Pre
sidio in San Francisco, was found un
conscious on the track of the South
ern Pacific, near West Berkeley, to
night. He had evidently been struck
by a train. He is seriously injured
and will probably die, his skull being
badly- fractured and. one leg broken.
Papers in his pocket show that he i*
24" years of age and comes from Ten

The boy entered the room, turned
up the gas and began undressing. Be
fore he had removed all his clothing
he was overcome by the fumes and
fell to the floor unconscious. An hour
later his father became alarmed at
his long absence and forced an en
trance to the room. .The young man
was found unconscious and died,
despite a doctor's efforts.
The cause of the escaping gas was
the absence of a vent^from the heat
er, no p,ipe having been run out of the
room and this permitted the fumes
from the gas to fill the room the same
as if it had been turned directly from
the pipes into the room. On previ
ous occasious three other members
of the family were overcome by the
fumes, but they- were discovered in
time to save their lives. The Coroner
will institute an investigation.

A skeptical mind may utterly refuse even to
consider the miracles, dismissing them as
pious fict'on, Derbaos. or hypnotic hallucina
tion*. But- the extraordinary revolution of
thought and feeling and. conduct that occurred
in the life and chat actor of St. Paul cannot
be so airily distreditfd. This was what
changed one of the foremost infideU of the
last century into a convinced believer.
I nlty the unhappy materialist who can see

fore Grace Church parishioners yester

take up.
"That I may, know Him and the
power of His Resurrection," St Paul's

sided at the organ and rendered the
opening solo. The organ solo at the

lRrgr-. even for Easter. The bright
i-iniEhine, after weeks of rain and
Kombcr weather, seemed to invite and
even command that people should leave
their homes and join in the commemor
ation. So they came from the man
sions of the rich and the cottages of
the poor, from the homes of Americans
and from those of the Latin and Teu
tonic peoples, who form so strong an
element in San Francisco's population.
Every place of worship was crowded.
'Among the throngs were perhaps somi?
\slio seldom enter a church, attracted
thither for the nonce by the command
ing: imprespiveness of the anniversary
and the splendor of the services.
On the streets, too, the day was evi
dently no ordinary Sunday. Not for
months have, the Sabbath crowds been
so large, whether viewed upon the
city's thoroughfares, in its public
Â«;quares, cr at the Cliff and in <Jolden
Gate Park. Men. women and children â
especially children â enjoyed the fresh.
Bunny air and the brisk breezes that
mj free from the suggestion of rain
just' past or just to come. The breath
cf spring was in the atmosphere, and
after th? hours for churcu had passed
it kept thousands upon the streets or
took them for the rest of the day to
thr places of outdoor recreation.
Of course it was an Easter crowd
in the matter of dress. The accept
ed usage by which men and women
welcome the arrival of this anniver-
Bary as the signal for donning spring
attire obtains here as it docs through
out all lands that call their civiliza
tion European. So the throngs of
yesterday were bright in the lighter
tiurs of spring and summer, seen in
t'n" clothes not only of the women
and children, but of the men as well.
Por some the day ineant. doubtless, a
dress parade, and for them it amply
fulfilled their expectations.
But besides the warmer tints in
Â¦millinery aud dress that prophesy the
mining Â«-Â»f summer, much of the color
on the streets was the color of flowers.
Hlossoms were carried by a majority
of the gentler sex on the sidewalks
and in the street cars. Seldom have
fo many been seen In the hands of
pedestrians, and indeed it was an ex
ception almost rare enough to attract
attention when a woman or little miss
failed to have a bunch of Hllies or vio
lets or more parish flowers in her
hand.". Thus they celebrated the im
mortal anniversary and at the same
time 'he dories <tf California, the
land of perpetual bloom.
The music selected for the day was
chosen from the best of the magniSccni
compositions in which the masters of
harmony in Europe and America have
vied with one another in honoring tho
central event of Christian history. In
strumental and vocal solos were ren
dvred by famous artists in reverent and
touching manner. Splendid choirs of
trained vocalists, who had given weeks
to preparation, sane the anthems dear
to the fathers of the church in many
aÂ£es and many lands. Music ever plays
a leading part in the Easter service,
and the music heard in the loca'
churches yesterday was worthy of the
occasion.
The celebration of Easter in the
churches of San Francisco has never
been more general, more beautiful, or
more impressive than It was yesterday.
Without exception, whether Protestant
or Catholic, the congregations were re
minded In music and sermon, as well
ea by elaborate floral decoration,
cf the meaning of the day, the hallowed
memories evoked by it during nineteen
Christian centuries, and the promise of
immortality it holds out in bidding a
busy, careless world to better things.
With few exceptions the sacred edi
fices were especially prepared for the
great anniversary with masses of
grt-cn color. Easter lilies every
Â«here were s?oen among the decora
tions of chancel and choir and altar
rail, and in many instances these white
emblems of the Christian renascence
formed the sole but adequate orna
ment added in memory of the resurrec
tion.

Sir William Van Home has given
some very good advice touching pro
jected-railroads in the Philippines,
drawn from his experience in Cuba.
Sir' William declares that the success
which has attended his efforts in Cuba
is largely due to the methods employed
in dealing with the native inhabitants.
Had he and his colleagues been guided
by a short-sighted policy of chipping
off a little here and a little there at
the expense of the native, In Sir Wil
liam's opinion he would have been
doomed to failure. Seeds would have
been planted which would have borne
bitter fruit for generations. He en
deavored not only to obtain, but even
more, to deserve, the confidence of the
natives from the very outset as the
basis of operations. He employed only
native labor in constructing the 400
miles of the Cuban railroad, and
awarded no building contracts. To.
have done so would, in Sir William's
view, have been suicidal. His success
in Cuba convinces him that the same
policy should be followed in the Philip
pines if the dual object of the Ameri
can Goverrtment â to educate the Fili
pinos in "respect for the Americans, and
confidence in them, and' at the same
time to" bring about the 'industrial de
velopment of the islandsâ is to be se
cured.
The Government has three alterna
tives in constructing the projected
Philippine railroadâ it could either
build the line with its own forces, or it
could let contracts for construction, or,
thirdly, endow with sufficient power
some company whose interests would
be the same as the -Government's in-
Philippine Railroads.
The famous Valley of Death in the
island of Mindanao, in the Philip
pines, has at last been compelled to
give up the rich treasure which for
ages it has successfully guarded by its
pall of death-dealing gases. This val
ley, which, true to its name, has dealt
death to many a venturesome search
er for the precious metal, is located
in the. mountain fastnesses of the isl
and, and, according to the theories of
scientists, it is the crater of what was
once a great and violent volcano. Vol
canic gases of a most poisonous na
ture still rise from the depths of the
valley and hang over it like a pall,
never passing ajvay, and many na
tives, who have attempted to go down
into the valley from the mountains,
say that never before has any man
who ventured into its unknown depths
returned to tell of its secrets. The
distance across the valley is only a
few miles, but the botttom of it is con
stantly concealed from view by the
dense cloud of poisonous vapor over
hanging it.
An American named Rudy formed a
party at Manila, consisting of himself
and two other Americans, and, em
ploying three native guides, proceed
ed to the mountains enclosing the val
ley, where one of the Americans with
the guides were left in charge of the
outfit, while the other two entered
the valley with their heads completely
covered by an apparatus similar to
that worn by divers. Carrying on
their backs small tanks of compressed
air for breathing purposes so as to
avoid inhaling the deadly vapors, the
men worked in the valleysjor months,
carrying sackful after sackful of gold
bearing sand and gravel up the moun
tain side. This work -was continued
until both were almost worn out from
the depressing work and the fumes of
which they were forced to breathe a
portion, but never once could any of
the natives be persuaded to venture
beyond the outer circle of the poison
ous gases. .

The problem of obtaining nitrogen
from the/ atmosphere for fertilizing
the land appears to have been solved,
at least from a scientific point of ,
view, by Doctor Erlwein, a German |
experimenter. His method is first to
separate nitrogen from oxygen by
passing an air-current over a red-hot
copper, when the oxygen combines
with the metal, leaving the nitrogen
free. Then the nitrogen is caused
to combine in an electric furnace with
a mixture of powdered charcoal and
lime. The product is a black sub^- -
stance suitable to be spread on th-A
land, and possessing the fertilizing
properties of Chile saltpeter and pot
assium nitrate. It remains to be dem
onstrated that the new fertilizer can
be produced on a large scale at an
economical cost.

Mrs. Lou Wallace, the wife of the au
thor of "Ben Huf," tells in her book,
"The City of the King," how the first
Easter eggs came to be, according to
legend. Says she, "The Syrian bulbul
(nightingale) has the loveliest voice of
all God's creatures and the saddest
song ever heard. Shady coverts fring
ing the Jordan still shelter the bird
that 'sings darkling.*
"There is a legend that the bulbul
sat in the olive tree in the garden of
Joseph of Arimathea, and, the night
before the Resurrection, through the
darkness' poured out her soul in sor
rowing plaint above the still sleeper
in the tomb wherein was never man
laid. When the first Easter morning
broke over the Eastern hills the eggs
in the nest of the broodling bird spar
kled with gold, blue, orange and crim
son; and so we color eggs at Easter
for a memorial of the lone singer who
sang by the Holy Sepulchre nineteen
hundred years ago."

THE California Promotion Committee. is nothing if
not whole-hearted in its work of developing the re
sources of the State and bringing California's op
portunities before the eyes of the East. It has an
nounced as its latest project a "development dinner" to
be held at the Palace on April 30, whereat representatives
from all sections of California are to entertain and be
entertained by a review of the material development of
the State and suggestions for its increased prosperity in
the future.
The chief object of the Promotion Committee's dinner
is to bring into touch with one another the various civic
and trade Â¦ organizations now working independently
throughout the State with a view to securing unity of
action and harmony of ideas on the part of all associa
tions which- have the common end in view, the ad
vancement of the material welfare of California.
At present time there are promotion clubs in vari
ous cities, boards of trade, manufacturers' associations
and chambers of commerce, all working for the special
intergsjs of their respective' communities and thereby
doing incidental good to the State as a whole. The Cali
fornia Promotion Committee, which has, no exclusive
alliance with any one community or section of the State,
but gives its endeavors for the well being of the whole
â¢commonwealth, is in a position to serve as the rallying
point for a united endeavor on the part of all the sec
tional associations in the general interests of the State.
Neither desiring nor assuming any leadership over these
organizations, the California Promotion Committee
seeks merely by this dinner to bring upon a common
ground workers in the same cause from every portion
of California.
The "development dinner" should be productive of re
sults profitable to every community and to the State at
large. California is rapidly developing a broad and lib
eral spirit of unanimity in the cause of the State's prog
ress. It is not now the booming of Los Angeles or the
colonization of the Sacramento Valley which is the de
sideratum, but the development of California, the ex
ploitation of its resources throughout the East, the im
provement of its opportunities at home. The Promotion
Committee's symposium should plant the impulse for a
united endeavor in this direction.

When his friend accosted him t,htis, his
mind being still on his recent sorrow,
he supposed that the inquiry was as to
the condition of his boy, so, with tear

The great war shadow which for
weeks has overhung the turbid waters
of the Yellow Sea is at last beginning
to move across the frosty Manchurian
plains, and bit by bit comes the news
which enables us to guess something of
the strategy of the coming grand en
counter. The railways of Manchuria
are like a great capital T on the map of
thp country- The fiat top part crosses
the province from the Siberian Railway
t>n the left to Vladivostok on the right,
and from the middle drops the upright
stalk. 600 miles long, which leads to
JVrt Arthur. At the middle point, in
the very center of Manchuria, stands
Harbin, whore General Alexieff will go
on concentrating his great army till the
\\n\f- comes to make a move in the
Fpring. From Harbin to the sea are
two lines of railway, both of them
practically level all the way. The 600
nilcs of line to Port Arthur has no
gradient of more than 1 in 110, and the
r;.O miles to Vladivostok have no point
stopper than 1 in 75. Up both these
tailwayg, it is clear. Japan Is prepar
ing to pu?h toward the Russian center,
the is attacking Vladivostok and also
isolating it by aiming at the railway
jnland from Possiet Bay. From Taku-
in the Kprean Bay, she is seek
ii.-g to isolate Port Arthur by cutting
the other line at Liaoyang. 200 miles
north, and also cutting the line of com
munication of the Russian troops on
the Yalu, which leaves the railway at
Uaoyang. It is clear that the Russian
. general, instead of advancing gayly
into Korea, will have to concentrate
his whole forces at Harbin and await
the onslaught of the foe. The siege of
Port Arthur will be but an incident.
What is this city where Russia will
resist to the death the effort to drivt
her out of the Far East? We have all
heard of the wonderful way in which
Russia has conjured up the cities of
Port Arthur, Dalny and Vladivostok,
for- these places are on the sea, where
rjjy traveler may note their progress.
Less has been told of Harbin, the cen
tral point where Russia has with won
derful foresight been creatine the cap
ital ihat she intends shall f.^n one of
the greatest markets of all the fertile
East. Half a dozen years ago, when a
great army of Russian and native
workers were unrolling the Manchurian
Railway over the plain so fast that the
construction train hardly came to a
â¢standstill, when each day found the
railroad three or four miles nearer the
Pacific, there was no Harbin. Not even
a native village marked the place. It
was merely a point on the banks of the
Sungari River running northward to
ward its junction with the mighty
Amur. But when Russia threw across
the stream a manj--piered bridge of
stone and steel and the railway began
to move forward in two directions,
southward as well as to the east, the
junction soon became- a place of note.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It was a site for a great citr which
even Ebenezer Howard would have en
vied. For hundreds of miles round
about the great plain teemed with
wealth of many kinds â wheat and oats
and barley, beans and millet and hemp,
tobacco and timber, vegetables and
fruit. There was abundant grazing
land, and coal and minerals were
within easy reach. And all this
wealth naturally found its entrepot
and common market Just at this point.
The three railways, one to Russia, one
to the Pacific and one to the Yellow
Sea, made the whole province natural
ly feed the trade of Harbin. Besides
this there was the Sungari, its winding
course through the plain navigable for
200 miles above (or south of) Harbin,
and during seven months of the year
giving access to the Amur, Asia's great
watery highway to the east.
Russia promptly set to work to see
that Harbin should be built on sensible
lines from the outset â should be
planned before it was built. She deter
mined that the town should be purely
Russianâ and already it is being called
the "Moscow of the East" For miles
around the land has been secured, and
only Russians or Chinese may own
land, make buildings or carry on any
permanent business in or near it. In
1901 the Russian population was 12,000;
. In Mav, 1903, 44,000. and last October,
60,000. without counting soldiers. Jap
anese, Austrians, Greeks, Turks and
â¢ all other races onlv numbered 700. The
Chinese population totaled 40,000, in a
separate settlement.
And the flow of Russian population
to Harbin is no mere transient thing.
Nearly a third of the 60,000 Russian
civilians were women. A fine church
has been built, a number of hotels, an
imposing railway station. Government
buildings, hospitals, a magnificent
bank, fine business streets, and even
such adjuncts of higher civilization as
a school of commerce and a women's
college! More than Â£3,000,000 has been
ppent on the public buildings alone,
and an electric tramway, an autoxno
bHe line and electric lighting have been
provided. Like the London County
Council, the Russian Government re
tains the. land in its own hands, and
lets it to builders on a lease of a little
more than eighty years. One of the
of. the town is the Russo-Chi
nese Bank, an institution energetically
worked in the interest of Russian
trade. Liberal loans are granted to
Russians doing a genuine and prudent

buildings, but of the enterprises them

An occurrence that never was pub
lished took place in the early sixties,
in which figured Lillie Hitchcock, now
Mrs. Howard Coit. It was one night
when an alarm came in from a box on
Howard and Spear streets. Miss Lillie
heard the alarm in her father's resi
dence on Sutter street and, jumping
out on the sidewalk, she speeded along
to and down Montgomery street in the
hope of meeting the engine coming
from the exempt headquarters on
Brenham place.
Missing the engine, â¢ she ran as far
as Washington street, where she found
a horse and buggy belonging to Dr.
Toland hitched to a post. She unhitched
the animal, jumped into the buggy and
drove as fast as the horse could
go till , she . arrived at the scene
of the fire, where she lent a hand
to the boys in working the hand pump.
In the meantime Dr. Toland missed his
horse and buggy and, hastening* to po
lice headquarters, he informed Captain
Douglass of his loss. Douglass detailed
one of his men to find the horse and its
purloiner, if possible. The officer who
was detailed learned who .had taken
the animal and, in pursuance to orders,
he brought Miss Coit back with him to
the doctor's oflice, where a good laugh
was indulged in and the matter ended
in praise of the heroine * who would
purloin any man's animal to be on
hand at a fire. , ,

AS the year advances it is becoming apparent from
the usual commercial reports that' 1904 is not mak
ing as good a showing as 1903. There 'is a de
crease almost everywhere, and while it is not large it is
sufficiently general to establish the fact that the ten
dency in 1904 is. toward quieter markets all. along the
line. "
How much of this loss is attributable to bad weather
yet remains to be determined, but it is indisputable that
the weather is responsible for considerable of it. Tem
peratures have ruled low and at times have been so
severe as to almost suspend business in the northern
tie* of States, while bad roads and snowdrifts have hin
dered wagon and rail transportation. Scarcity of cars,
too, is reported from some sections. Again, the^scason
has been very backward, to the marked detriment of
spring trade, and altogether the elements have conspired
to set 1904 back in comparison with 1903. With clearer
and more seasonable weather throughout the country
business may revive and possibly overtake the record of
1903 later on.
But it must not be inferred from the foregoing that
American trade is dull. Far from it. The whole country
is doing a large business, only the activity is not as pro
nounced as in 1903, while the margins of profit' are not as
wide. The bank clearings continue to show a loss week
after week from the preceding year, the decrease last
week being 22 per cent, with all but three important
cities- St. Louis," New Orleans and Kansas Cityâ in the
wrong column, while the aggregate clearings fell to
$1,708,480,000. The loss at New York was 28.4 per cent,
\-. Boston 19.3 per cent, at Pittsburg 3*-9 per cent, and so
on. The gains of the three cities mentioned above were,
small, ranging from 38 to 4-9 P" cent. The failures
for the week were 208, against 173 for the same week
last year, and included a very large trust company at
Cleveland.
The staples make only a fair showing. Manufacturing
returns are conflicting, some sections holding their
ground, while others report idle mills. The Minneapolis
flour mills have been obliged to close down for a few
days several times of late owing to the poor demand for
flour, the cotton and woolen mills have much idle ma
chinery, while the New England footwear factories / re
pcrt a natural reaction from the abnormal activity of
th; past four or five years. The iron and steel industries
are sending in fair reports, though they are often con
tradictory, and do not therefore indicate any especial ac
tivity in this line. Provisions are apparently getting
quieter and the tendency in prices for pork products is
downward rather than upward, while the output of hogs
is much larger than that of last year and apparently in
creasing.
The packers of Chicago and .'other Western centers
have succecQcd in loading up the provision trade with a
large quantity of stock which they are. now trying to
work off, while the packers embrace every opportunity
to ladh them out some more. High prices for cotton
have rendered cotton- manufacturers extremely cautious
in their operations, as already mentioned, while firm wool
markets have also tended to restrict the purchases of
woolen manufacturers. The railway earnings-- are % still
running behind those or 1903!. and though the falling off
h slight, being only 1.2 per cent in March, it is still
a falling off.
But thee are yet favorable features. The crop pros
pects are good all over the country and the winter wheat,
taking the belt as a whole, is in fair condition, with
better crop weather reported in many regions during the
past few days. Agricultural implements have thus far
this spring made the best showing on record, and lumber
and other building mrterials are reported in better de
mand. Stronger and more active hide markets in the
West reflect more movement in the tanning industry.
The cotton planters rnd the South generally have reaped
a rich harvest from the enormous advance in prices for
cotton.
The banking interests throughout the country report
funds in large supply, with interest rates normal, and the
banker; themselves arc sanguine of the future, while
those of New York are persistent bulls on general trade
conditions and encourage by all possible means the ex
pansion of all legitimate and reasonably safe enterprises.
When it is considered that only a year ago these sam?
banking interests were contracting loans and discourag
*ing and actually checking expansion in every form, this
turn about on their part is not only significant but highly
reassuring.
The situation in Wall street shows little change, but
values on the whole are improving. It is recognized 1 by
everybody in touch with the financial situation that the
monetary conditions of the country are on a most excel
lent basis and that the standard stocks on the present
plane are as good investments as can be found anywhere,
but still the people are not taking hold of the market as
freely as could be wished. They apparently need a
further rest and more complete recovery from the great
losses sustained in the enormous shrinkage in values of
last year. It is expected, however, that. when the.pur
chasing capacity of the "public Â¦ is once more restored
renewed activity in the stock market will be witnessed.
With the Northern Securities decision at last out of the
way, with plenty of money on hand and stock quotations
comparatively low, there is no reason why such expan
sion in investment buying should not occur, very soon.
In California the prospects for the coming year con
tinue brilliant. There have ' been some losses from
floods, but the main portion of the State is enjoying an
excellent trade outlook. The central and northern por
tions have been thoroughly drenched by the heavy rains
of February and March, while even the south, where
the prospects for several months were extremely dubious,
has now received sufficient rain to practically, irfsure at
least fair crops. The season, however, is backward, as
the incessant storms have checked farm work, and in
many sections some weeks must elapse before the lost
time can be recovered. Almost all farm products are
bringing prices very remunerative to the farmers an*
fruit-growers, and the city and interior banks report
funds very plentiful. The export and local trade of the
whole co?.st is active, there are no large failures to excite
apprehension, and, taking the situation as a whole, it is
very cheering and full of promise.
Flour-making is Harbin's great in
dustry. Already there are eight mills
with modern European and American
machinery, and two more are being
erected, which will bring up the pro
duction to nearly a million pounds a
day. The wheat area is practically
unlimited, and corn is delivered at the
mills at flfteenpence to eighteenpence
a bushel. Brickmaking is another
busy industry, two hundred plants
being at work. Good red bricks are
turned out at about thirteen shillings
a thousand, the Chinese workers get
ting a wage of ninepence a day. Next
among the industries of Harbin comes
the making of the Russian spirit
"vodka." Owing to the absence of the
heavy Russian tax, the spirit Is less
than a quarter of the home price in
Manchuria, and there are eight dis
tilleries; which do an enormous trade
throughout the province. A glass
bottle factory Is being built in Man
churia for this trade. Three brewer
ies are being built, and with barley at
an almost nominal price no doubt
Manchuria will soon be flooded with
beer as well as vodka. With its
splendid grazing land and cheap corn
for feeding, Manchuria supplies fine
meat, and there are several companies
at Harbin curing and packing haras,
bacon and smoked meats. Altogether
Harbin is a marvelous example of what
can be done by a great nation bent on
commercial Expansion and bringing
its concentrated forces to the help of
its citizens. With millions of cheap
Chinese laborers, great coalfields,
mountains of iron and copper, limit
less* forests and agricultural land
producing the cheapest food in the
world. Russia seemed but yesterday to
have untold wealth within her grasp.
To-day it seems that she may not pos
sess all without a struggle, and Har
bin, the magic capital city, summoned
as by Aladdin's lamp out of the air,
bids fair to be the scene of one of the
greatest military struggles that his
tcry has known. â London News.

Russian exDorts to Manchuria, en
abling the Chinese to carry on the
commerce, for which the.v are so emi
nently fitted, among their own country

the Russian exporter against loss. The
bank also facilitates the export of
Manchurlan products, but will do noth
ing for foreigners. All classes, both
official and commercial, seem to work
together with a feverish desire for
Russian control, and Russian trade is
rapidly driving other commerce out of
the field. The foreigner, trying to work
over an unfriendly railway at exorbi

not even allowed the possession of a

and Great-Britain combined can rule the world.' In
stead of making an unfavorable impression upon France,
as might have been expected, this proposition seems to
have moved the French to unfriendly demonstrations
against the United States. Even such -a soundly sea
soned politician as . M." Hanotaux says that we have been
sticking pins in Russia and -that "on. account of business
interests we are willing to risk the peace of the world."
All this is because neither Russia nor France under
stands us. Continental diplomacy has so long been sin
ister, covert, selfish and false that Continental statesmen
comprehend no other and very naturally ascribe 'to us
the same motives that actuate them" and the only motives
of which- they know. They find no difficulty in under
standing. Russian -diplomacy, for it is gilded lying, such
as' they all use; To be direct, frank and honest is of
course to stick pins in any nation that is. tortuous and
false in its international dealings/ The French press is
in sympathy with Continental diplomacy. The Echo
says: "If the Russian bear should show his teeth both
English, and Americans would soon think it best to be
good." The best test for that is for Adam Zad to show
his teeth. We would proceed to pull them out without
assistance., i^\'': â¢'â¢;?:
Of course it is. the manifestation of friendship and re
gard for our feelings that lead Russia to boast of her
intention to chase our commerce out of the Pacific by
dominating Eastern Asia. It is friendly for a Cossack
to pull down our flag from our consulate at Newchwang.
It is friendly to repeat, at this late day, the falsehood
that our naval commander refused to res'cue the Rus
sians from drowning when the Variag was sunk. Our
people note all these things andÂ«are patient and approve
the wise neutrality of their Government. But if the

worked assiduously to secure the entry
into Oakland of competing lines of
railroad. Some five years ago the di
rectors of the , Board of Trade ap
pointed the committee on railroads
as a committee to confer with similar
committees to be appointed by , the
City Council. Improvement ; clubs and
PROVIDES EXCURSIONS
Some two years ago the "AH* Day
for~a Dollar" excursions each Monday
and Friday from Ban Francisco were
inaugurated, and upward of 5000 peo
ple have by means of these excursions
been Induced to visit Oakland. Berke
ley, Piedmont, Haywards and Inter
vening cities and towns. Scores of per
sons who first visited the east side of
the bay as excursionists have located
therein business or as residents.
To attain even this small appropria
tion the harbor and water front com
mittee has worked hard and devoted
many hours to the citizens of Oak
land.
In February of 1904 from five or six
Ur thirty or more letters a day were re
ceived in which the writers not only
asked for literature, but anywhere from
one to half a hundred questions con
cerning Oakland or Alameda County.
Each of these letters was answered in
detail and literature was forwarded, en
tailing a large amount ot work and
correspondence.
The distribution of literature among
residents of less favored sections of the
country has been productive of good re
sults. The hundreds of new buildings
being erected in Oakland are monu
ments to the efficacy of advertising. All
the new residences are not building for
present residents of the city, nor are
all the new stores and offices occupied
by long-time residents of Oakland.
During the last year nine hundred and
fifty-seven residences and flats have
been built in Oakland alone â that is,
within the city limits. Very many of
these homes have been built by people
who previous to coming to Oakland
were residents of Eastern cities and
who in seeking a better climate had
written for and received literature of
this city as sent out by the Board of
Trade.
The work of the board is not confined
to securing hew comers and manu*fac
tories for Alameda County. Ever since
the inception and incorporation of the
board Its efforts have been devoted to
the development of Oakland harbor.
With fifteen miles of water front and
an absolutely perfectly sheltered ha
bcT, It is but natural that the Board
of Trade Ehould aim to provide a chan
nel sufficiently deep to allow the' en
trance of vessels of any and all
draught.
The harbor and water front commit
tee, consisting of James P. Taylor, Ed
son F. Adams, M. J. Keller, E. C. Ses
sions and Hugh Hc-gan, has been in
defatigable In Its efforts to secure the
deepening of the channel. The mem
bers have had the hearty co-operation
of Senator Perkins and Congressman
Metcalf, . with ths result that a year
ago Congress made an appropriation of
$250,000 for the deepening of the har
bor. This amount, however. Is wholly
inadequate for the purpose aijd not
commensurate with the commerce of
Oakland. â¢
PROOFS OF RESULTS
In February of the present year the
membership was more than 300, and had
been at that figure for several months,
allowing the publication and dissemina
tion of k.rge quantities of literature.
The results were plainly discernable.
to make the advantages of Oakland
known throughout the world, the fol
lowing facts may be of interest: During
the month of February two years ago
the membership in the Oakland Board
of Trade was but 135. which meant a
revenue of but $135 per menth, barely
sufficient to pay the running expenses,
tho rent of rooms and salary of secre
tary. The publication of literature of
sufficiently high standing to attract
.more than passing notice was omitted.
The result was that but two letters of
interest were receivpd by the secretary
of the Board ef Trade during the entire
month.

Many of the principal improvements
in Alameda County can be traced to
the efforts of the Oakland ' Board of
Trade.
The- Western Pacific Railroad was
materially assisted by the Board of
Trade in securing rights of way an3
terminals In Oakland and ere another
two years 'have elapsed It 13 hoped thar
the entry Into Oakland on the first
Western Pacific train will be duly cele
brated. '..'':
other mercantile organizations, to in
duce other transcontinental railroads
to make Oakland their terminus. The
present chairman of the railroad com
mittee of the Oakland Board of Trade.
M. J. Keller,' was made chairman "of
the "joint committee formed at that
time for the purpose of conferrine with
the officials of the Santa Fe to reaucst
that road to come to Oakland. The
time was not ripe, however, but the
railroad committee of the board never
relinquished its efforts, and to-day
Messrs. Keller, C. J. Heeseman. D. K.
Collins, R. P. M. Greeley and J. Tyr
rel, composing the committee on rail
roads, are arranging for a celebration
of the dayâ May 2â when the first Santa
Fe train will enter Oakland.
When the telegraphic press reports
announced that President Roosevelt
was contemplating a visit to Califor
nia the Oakland Board of Trade was
the first to send an invitation to the
chief executive to visit Oakland. The
invitation was accepted, and the Board
of Trade, feeling that the entertain
ment of j bo distinguished a visitor
properly (belonged to the entire com
munity and not solely to the organ
ization whose invitation he had ac
cepted, requested the Mayor to appoint
a committee of citizens to receive and
entertain the President.
GOOD PKIiSKXT PROGRAMME.
At the present time a committee of
the Board of Trade is working in con
junction with;a committee from Ala
meda with a view to thre improvement
of Webster street, in Alameda. and
with every prospect of a successful cul
mination. It Is hoped to make of this
great thoroughfare a boulevard sixty
feet in width, connecting: the two cities.
Samples of a rush grown . in the
marsh lands "Were taken Cast a few
months ago by a large manufacturer
of matting. These samples were made
up into matting, apparently of excel
lent quality, and the Board of Trade
is to-day, with the assistance of the
University of California, experiment
ing in raising this rush or tule. Experi
ment stations have been started at
Pleasantoji and Elmhurst. If the ex
periment proves successful thousands
of acres of marshy land in California,
now practically useless, will become
very valuable. The manufacturers of
matting agree to take\all the rush or
tule that can be raised upon 10.000
acres if It is proved by the experiments
now being conducted by the Board of
Trade that the tule can bo grown suc
cessfully, or In other words that it can
be grown to the desired length.
The board is now in correspondence
with several Eastern manufacturers,
with a view to inducing them to lo
cate plants on the eastern side of the
Bay of San Francisco, where tran<s
pcrtatlon by rail and water meet.

As an Instance of the results' of in
creased membership and large civic
pride and a more far-reaching desire
Membership in the board is not con
fined to any one line of business or to
any number of lines. Any and all per
sons of good moral character who are
interested in the growth of the city of
Oakland or Alameda County are eligi
ble. The names of applicants for mem
bership are presented by members at
any of the regular meetings of the
board of directors. The names are bal
loted upon, and upon election dues of
$1 per month become payable. These
dues are used for the current or run
ning expenses and for compiling, print
ing and mailing illustrated literature
throughout the civilized world. Every
merchant, manufacturer, professional
man. contractor or property owner is
or should be interested in the growth
of his city. Every new family located
in a city through the efforts of a
Board of Trade means added business
to all lines of trade and all professions
in the community.
UXES OF MEMBERSHIP.
During its existence the membership
of the Board of Trade has varied from
100 to a f*>\v more than 500. the latter
figure, however, only having been
reached within a month.
At times during th*> last sixteen years
interest in advertising Oakland by the
business and professional men and
property owners waned to such an ex
tent as to make it almost impossible
to expend any money in that direction.
Then, again, renewed interest, either
In th*> Board of Trade or in the results
attained by sending descriptive litera
ture Bast, was Fhown; new members
wore added to the board, new litera
ture was printed and an increase in
immigration was the result.
Sixteen yean? ago on the 18th of this
month the Oakland Board of Trade
was incorporated. During that time
many manufactories have been located
in Oakland and Alameda County
through the efforts of the board.
Hundreds of families, now living
within the tonfines of the county
of Alameda first learned of Oak
land through the literature sent out by
this board. Ever sine* its inception it
has advertised not only the city of
Oakland, but all of Aiameda County,
to the best of its ability and with
varied results, dependent almost solely
upon its membership and consequently
on the amount of money on hand to ad
vertise with.

The report of the McCall investiga
tion committee is looked for the laUer
part of the week. v
WASHINGTON, April 3.â The early
part of the present week will be de
voted to the postoffice appropriation
. bill, and. when that measure is dis
posed of the Panama canal bill will be
taken up. The canal bill will be among
the few meagu res* other than appro
priation bills that will receive attention
before final adjournment. The amend
ments will probably be debated at some
length. It is expected that by the time
the canal bill shall be disposed of the
sundry civil bill will have been re
ported from the committee, whereupon
it will be 'considered.
. During the week there will be discus
sions of various ' other bills, Including
the bill for the protection of the Presi
dent, on which Hoar will "speak Mon
day; the pure food bill, ort which Hey
burn will speak on Tuesday, and the
Chinese exclusion bill, which will be
discussed on Wednesday by Patterson.
Thursday will be .devoted to eulogies
on the late Senator Hanna.
, The -. Swayne impeachment resolution
will be the feature of the proceedings
in the House .this week. Legislation
for the District of Columbia will have
the right of way part of Monday, and
the remainder of the day will be
utilized for the passage of bills under
suspension of the rules. On Tuesday
and Wednesday the conference report
on the District of Columbia appropria
tion bill, to which the Senate has made
amendments, will take precedence and
the military academy bill will be dis
posed of during this time, as will con
ference reports on several minor House
bills. On Thursday the Swayne im
peachment case will be called up, and
present indications are that debate on
this subject will consume the balance
of the week. j

How One Woman Quit Medicine.
"While a coffee user ray stomach
troubled me for years." says a lady of
Columbus. O., "and I had to take medi-
cine all the time. I had what I thought
was the best stomach medicine I could
set, had to keep getting it filled all the
time at 40 cents a bottle. I did not know
what the cause of my trouble was, but
Just dragged along: from day to day
suffering and taking medicine all the
time.
"About six months ago I quit tea and
coffee and began drinking Postum and
I have not had my prescription filled
since, which is a great surpri** to me,
for It proves that coffee was the cause
of all my trouble .although I never sus-
pected it.
'"When my friends ask me how I feel
since I have been taking Postum I say.
â¢To tell the truth I don't feel at all
only that I get hungry and eat every-
thing I want and lots of it and it never
hurts me and I am happy and well and
contented all the time.'
"I could not get my family to drink
Postum for a while until I mixed it in
a Jiftle coffee and kept on reducing the
amount of coffee until I got it all Pos-
tum. Now they all" like it and they
never belch it up like coffee.
"We all know that Postum is a sun-.
Khine maker. I find it helps one greatly,
for we do not have to think of aches
and pains all the time and can use our
minds for other things." Name given
by Postum Co., Battle Creek. Mich.
The one who has to bother with cof;
fee aches and palne is badly handi-
capped In the race for fame and for-
tune. Postum is a wonderful rebuild-
er. There's a reason.
Look in each pkg. for the famous
little book, "The Road to Wellville." .

TO OUR PATRONS t
We respectfully wish to call your special
attention to the preeent condition of the labor
market.
Every branch of labor, skilled or unskilled,
. If overstocked and will remain ao all through
this winter, and gi the supply and demand
sovtrns _ !1 commodities, the fame always
_ovÂ«rns the labor market.
We were confronted early last spring with
â¢ prest scarcity of good, in fact, any clâ at
of labor, skilled or unskilled.
The great demand for help had a tendency
to make labor stubborn. co_seo,u?nUy we
were unable to cive our patrons such excel-
lent fcervice as we have in former years.
MURRAY & READY
RETURN THANKS.
We are much indebted to all employers
who thorf>UÂ£hly understood the labor market
end helped us to share somewhat the burden
i >;; upon ue.
GOLD CANNOT BUY HONOR.
The burden was not confined alone to the
laiKir market. Our entire buclne^s wa6 at-
tacked by unscrupulous labor agitators and
demagogues, who demanded that we ehould
Â»w.t eupply certain employers with any help.
"What ran we offer you." asked theee ag!-
:.--..:.-. "financially or otherwise, to discon-
tinue supplying them with help?" Our an-
â¢Â¦il : "Gentlemen, there is nothing in this
world you or any one el*e has that would
pure-hate from us the freedom the "Consti-
tution of tht United States' has given us.
V "â¢â¢ will forever eupply all employers of help
with whatever help they may so desire.
Likewise we will give to all applicants for
I>ce:Uuiis any position he is competent to
fill. . Creed, religion or politics shall never
be mentioned in our offâ -e. and when voa
Â«ct throutrk agitating and return to honrst
work or go into business for yourselves.
<-orae to us and we will never discriminate,
bot wJ!l try to make a raan of you. A man
arnoripst men, for all are equal before God
and the law. That's all. gentlemen. Good
day."
WE BELIEVE IN
JL"STI<Ti TO ALL.
Thon they placed a boycott on our busi-
DÂ«â h continued it for four months; but
jn_ a they found every employer of help,
'.arpe and en-.ail, rushed right lo us with
thÂ«ir orders for help and etood as solid asÂ«
the rocks cf Gibraltar, eeciag we doubled
our business, employing .fourteen clerks, sent
out co.eeo men â year 11KI3 â they held up
their hrnds. lock off the foolish boycott and
declared that they could not hurt â¢ 'Murray

WHO ARE TRUE FRIENDS OF LABOR?
Procure act friends in haste, nor break
the ties of friendship needlessly.
EMPLOYERS
YOU WELL REMEMBER
DAY AFTER DAY.
WK_K AFTER WEEK.
MONTH AFTER MONTH.
M_ny other Can Francisco employment
agents tried to help these labor agitators by
distributing leaflet* among the working men
reading as follows: "Notice â We do not sup-
ply any employer, firm or corporation who
B_ I a man strike on him." Advertised same
in all S. F. papers. Result: They soon
found many large and small employer* of
help had closed their business relations with
tui-h employment agents.
NEVER AGAIN WILL THESE WEAK-
KNEED EMPLOYMENT AGENTS RE-
CEJVB THK PATRONAGE OF ANY EM-
PLOYKR WHO BELIEVES ALL ARE
KCJUAL. ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO WORK
FOR A LIVING WITHOUT THK DICTA-
TION OF WALKING DELEGATES. AGI-
TATORS OR DEMAGOGUES
IT'S AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT
No employer of help knew or knows any
moment they will bai'e trouble, as these
labor acitators make a business of making
trouble.
No, they could not hurt ui> t because you
our customers, Ftood so manfully at our
Ijack; Â«rd for such we are ever grateful-
hence thl* lettrr of thanks.

It became evident early last fall to most
employer* of labor to either close down or

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway, April 3.
Booth-Tucker, commander of the
Salvation Armv in the United States,
spent the first day of his return to CaU
ifornia in the city of Oakland, where is
located the first corps of his army that
was founded upon this coast. The
commander, came to Oakland after his
morning visit to San Quentin and con
ducted two meetings, one in the after
noon and one in the evening. He was
accompanied by his entire party with
which he is traveling, many officers
from San Francisco and the "famous
Salvation Army Headquarters Band.
The two Oakland meetings were very
much out of the ordinary. Both cen
tered around Mrs. Emma Booth-Tuck
er, wife of the commander, who was
recently killed in an Eastern railroad
accident. The afternoon meeting was
a lecture upon the work of the Salva
tion Army that was prepared by the
dead consul, and was delivered by her
surviving husband; while the evening
meeting was a lecture prepared by the
commander upon the life of his wife,
entitled, "The Life of the Consul."
Thus It was, though her voice is stilled
by de;ah, that the words of the beloved
consii.i.'.-re heard by her many friends
and foiiowors in 'Oakland.
The stage of the theater waa occu
pied by the Eastern officers that ac
companied the commander and a num
ber of local officers. The commander's
party consists of Lieutenant Colonel
Thomas Scott, who has charge of all of
the industrial homes' of the army;
Lieutenant Colonel Annie Oaborne, who
is at the head of the training homes
for female officers of the army; Briga
dier E. J. Parker; Ensign Hester
Dammes, who was with the conÂ»ul
when she was killed; Ensign Bessie
Dickens of the headquarters staff; Ad
jutant Hansen, who is the photogra
pher of the party; Captain Tom Narra-,
way; Captain Billy Smith, once a fa
mous prize-fighter, and his" wife, and
the two little chUdren of Commander
Booth-Tucker. Tne local officers with
the commander were: Staff Captain F.
Erickson, Captain C. J. Schaefer, Brig
adier George Wood, Staff Captain A.
Crawford, . Ensign Crawford. Ensign
William Day. Adjutant T. H. Storey,
Mrs. L. R. Storey, Mrs. J. Banbury,
Colonel George French, Mrs. George
French, Major and Mrs. George Reed
and Adjutant Henstein.
Commander Tucker was Introduced
by Colonel French, who has charge of
the Oaklarid work. The opening prayer
was delivered by Lieutenant Colonel
Scott and there was some music by the
headquarters band. Commander Booth-
Tucker then delivered the lecture,
"Love and Sorrow," which was pre
pared by the late consul shortly before
her death. The commander alluded
quietly to that fact in announcing his
address and then he added that he was
glad to return to California and that
there was only one place that he liked
better than the Golden State and that
was heaven.
The lecture was largely upon the
work of the Salvation Army, its homes,
stations and colonies. It was illustrat
ed with stereopticon views and closecj
with a series of living pictures, also il
lustrative of the work of the army.
These pictures were posed by the two
little children of the commander and
the members of the commander's
party.
A great deal of attention was paid to
the colony work of the army and Com
mander Booth-Tucker told of the pro
posed plan by which the Government
land of the United States was to be
given to those that wanted to work it
in twenty-acre tracts, and the money
necessary to start the little farms to be
loaned by the Government at small in
terest. A bill to this effect is now be
fore Congress, and a resolution urging
the Senators and Representatives from
California to aid in its passage was
adopted. ;.':/:.'
The evening meeting was devoted to
a touching tribute to the dead consul.

Morris H. Morgan of Harvard and
Professor W. A. Merrill of the Univer
sity of California; for English, Ham

guished philosopher, James Ward, a
Fellow of Trinity, and professor of
mental philosophy at Cambridge, will
come from England to .lecture' on

To acquaint teachers with the best
modern methods of instruction in
their special fields will be the object
of many courses in individual depart
ments. Instruction in the theory of
education as such will be offered by
Professor Frank M. - McMurry of
Teachers' College of Columbia Univer
sity. Dr. Reginald A. Daly, geologist
for Canada to the International Boun

last six weeks, will be afforded an op
portunity of instruction from a faculty
comprising specialists from the lead

Europe, competent* to bring them into
touch with the latest developments oC
knowledge;.
For science there will be a rare as
semblage of men who are opening new
fields of knowledge. For chemistry

experiments have done much to shape
current theory as to the origin of spe
cies; and Svante August Arrheniua,
professor of physics in the University
of Stockholm, will come from Sweden
to lecture on physical chemistry, a
science whose bases were laid by his
discoveries, on the modern develop
ments of the serum treatment of dis
ease, and on the theory'of immunity.
The scientific instruction by these and
a number of other men will include
astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany,
zoology, physiology, mineralogy, phy
sical geography, civil engineering, me
chanical drawing, agriculture and en
tomology.
The provision for historical instruc
tion is likewise striking. Professor
Bernard Moses, recently returned
from three years* service as a member
of the United States Philippine Com
mission, will lecture on "Political De
pendencies" and on "Government" The
Eastern questionâ \\\e Balkans, Russia
in Asia, and China, Korea and Jap

Anxiety for Kailua. ,
Considerable anxiety is manifested for the
schooner Kailua. row 28 days out from Port
I Ludlow, bound for this port. She went to sea
i almost at the same time as the British chip
Lamorna. and frars are entertained that she
may have run Into the same storm that has
1 occasioned rumors of the loas of that vessel.
Ehe is a well built, stanch, four masted
echooner and Is owned by Hind. Rolph & Co.
Her cargo consists of 1.000,000 feet of lumber.

following changes in the rules govern
ing the airship contest:
The minimum speed required in the
race for the grand prize of $100,000 is
1S% miles an hour, instead of 20 miles.
Formal entries will be received until
June 1 instead of May 1.
The prize for the highest altitude at
tained Is withdrawn because of the
great danger in such contests.
There will be. only eight races' for.
spherical balloons instead of ten, and
they will begin the first Monday in
June. There will be no races in May.
Prizes of cuds, medals and other
trophies are offered for amateur bal
loon races, to . be held the second and
fourth Mondays in September.
The exposition company will furnish

coast. Arrangements have been made
with the Government to permit the
balloons to leave the fair grounds" in
races, but they must' be returned un
less wrecked, as the grounds are a
Government bonded warehouse.'

NEW; RIFLEMAN A WONDER.
The series just closed was exceptional
in many respects. Out of the six games.
Portland took but one and in four of
the six the visiting team failed to score.
The total number of runs made by
Portland in six games was four. There
were no features in to-day's game
aside from the pitching of Newton.
Two hits only were made off his de
livery, one in the first and one in the
ninth, both being bunt* and both made
by McCrcedie. The last- one w-as a
scratch hit. McCreedie put a bunt
down thiFd base line which Smith al
lowed to roll, as it was going toward
the foul line. The ball struck a small
stone, however, and rolled fair and
McCreedie was credited with a hit.
Butler pitched winning ball, but the
champions bunched three of their six
hits in one inning and won the game
with a single run. Attendance, 6000-

without 1 mercy. ; He Jwas there \ to give

cured and the" referee declared him ; the
victor.' --â¢'.- ; . â¢ -Ll\ * C â¢ - - 7;: ,';/"â¢-;
T' Summing up the Â¦ playjng * of both
Michael Egan of Jersey City can now
be hailed as the champion handball
player of the world, having clinched
his claim to the title by decisively de
feating James Fitzgerald of this city,
who disputed his right to the laurels.
Kgan and his rival completed their
series of games yesterday at the Olym
pic Club. The attendance was not so
large as oh the preceding Sunday, as
the ticket holders felt it was a-fore
gone conclusion (that Egan would cap
ture the remaining games.
Those who cro\Vded the balconies en
joyed some fast and brilliant playing.
They saw the heavily muscled Egan
smite the ball apparently with force
enough to drive it through^ the front
wall. They saw him display wonderful
strength and untiring resources in fast
rallies aad they watched the Eastern
man prove his superic-rity over Fitz
gerald in all but one department of the
game, and that was headwork. Fitz
gerald proved the headier player of the
pair. Had he possessed the necessary
stamina there is -no doubt that*, he
would have given Egan a better con
test. /
Fitzgerald played scientifically, but
his science amounted to little against
the fast ball Egan sent at him through
out th'p games. The local player killed
many balls and missed a great many
more. He tried hard tu keep the ball
just out of Egan's reach, but the cham
pion was always under it and when he
drove it to the front wall it traveled
with force to Bend it to' the back wall.
Fitzgerald gave a clever exhibition of
"killing"ifrom the back wall. He sent
the ball dow each time and Egan with
all his skill could not lay his big
"mitts" en the fast moving spheroid.
Egan played a gentlemanly game, but
in his anxiety- to get; close to the ball
he would balk Fitzgerald. He always
ran in front of Fitzgerald as if he an
ticipated where" the ball would land
and if Fitzgerald raised it out he would
catch it on the fly with either hand
and send it back to . his opponent.
Egan's , head collided with the -ball in
the first game and he was dazed for a
minute. The fast. shooting object bare
ly missed his right optic and had it
landed Egan would have probably re
tired from the pastime at which he is
such an expert.
Fitzgerald found . fault with ex-
Alderman Dunne's coaching and called
him to task. The local man captured the
first game, after the hardest kind. of a
struggle, and as they doffed their shirts
for greater comfort, Mr. Dunne, who
was scoring, called to Egan to change
the ball.., Fitzgerald lost his temper
and said: "It is not fair to coach him."
To which Mr. Dunne replied: "I want
to say one ward and that, is, when
you went in you said you. had a
right to select the -ball and when he
went in he could toss with any ball
he selected: I am interested in Mr.
Egan. I am the only gentleman here
with him."
"If I was in -condition I could beat
him," called back Fitzgerald.
"I'll bet a thousand dollars you can't
beat him," replied -Dunne.
Referee Hampton called game and
the two experts were at it again harder
than ever. â¢: -
Preliminary to the big game Joseph
Condon of the ' Occidental Handball
Club and Tom Leech of the St. Ig
natius Athletic Club outplayed Louis
Levy and Henry. Cory. Each side took
a game and in the: final. Leech and
Condon played championship ball and
ran away from their opponents.
When â¢ Egan and Fitzgerald entered
the court they were " given ; another
hearty greeting. After warming up,
game was called. , Egan started out' to
annex two games, but Fitzgerald
fought every inch, of ..the ..way. Egan
led at 19 to 15, and, the excitement. was
intense. By a series of ; hard serves,
clever - "kills"- 1 and heady, playing, Fitz
gerald won -the* opening game. 'This
did not bother. Egan. He simply began
sending the ball outyas. only, he can
send . it. 'Fitzgerald : tried valiantly, to
return , the ba'l,' but â¢ he ; missed ,with
frequency. Egan had - many opportu

Roy Hughie. Cloverdale, Tillie R, Red

W for the stake. From this array of
Fpeed it is evident High Born was a
consistent performer throughout. The
surprise of the day was the show'ing
made by the old champion, Sacra
mento Boy. The upcountry dog
made his way into the semi-final round,
where he succumbed tojligh Born by a
score of 7 to 6. They first ran an un
decided course and the young dog came
back the fresher.
The coursing throughout the day
was remarkably even. The bettors
seemed unable to hit upon a favorite
in the long odds book, playing the ma
jority of the last sixteen dogs in the
stake. Liberal prices were chalked up
against all of them.
Pepper Jack and Ml Amigo ran five
trials in the first round before Judge
Reiily could declare the latter a win
ner.
New Home Boy,, the Los. Angeles
creek, and Itubber Ankles met in a
special match of one course during the
afternoon. New Home Boy- won by a
seore of 10 to 5, leadinpr by four lengths.

of the reserve stake yesterday on the

Many of the players who were ab
sent were not defaulted yesterday, but
those not on hand next Sunday will
lose by default, as ffhe tournament
committee has decided to finish the
event then. â¢
On the California Club courts some
good . practice matches were * played.
The best was that between Harry
Haight and Grant Smith. Halght.won
the first set, but the next three, went
to his opponent easily. The following
matches were played:
George Janes beat Miller Hotchkiss
in two close sets. S,core 8â6, 6â4. Janes
was in turn beaten* by Clarence Foley.
Foley was in great form. He won the
first set "easily, but had a hard time
winning the next two. The score was
6â1, 7â9, 7â5.
Brabant won in his match with G:
W. Finch, but was beaten easily by
Neil Baker. The score was 6â 3. 6â1.
Some interesting tournament Â¦ play
was seen on the California and Gold
en Gate Park tennis courts yesterday.
A strong wind sweeping over the
courts made it rather difficult at times
to lob and play .high balls, but the
matches as a rule were close.
On the California Club courts, the
handicap doubles tournament ! which
was started. on Washington's birthday
was completed. The final match was
fully as close as was expected. The
winners were Tracy Crawford and
Will Allen, who defeated Sidney Salis
bury and Frank Stringham on. even
terms. All four players were erratic
and hardly up to form. Salisbury and
Stringham won the first set rather, eas
ily by a seore of 6 â 3. In the second set
Allen and Crawford improved consid
erably and their net work was much
better. They won this set, 6â4. Tha
third set was nip and tuck, with first
one in the lead and then the other.
Each side won on service, and not
more than one game separated the
teams until the end. The score, iu favor
of Allen and Crawford, was 9â7. The
fourth and . last set was one of the
most stubbornly contested seen in some
time. Allen and Crawford kept, ahead
up to 5â3 and looked to have the match
won. Again at 5 â 4 and 40-15 they
looked sure winners. Salisbury and
Stringham made a determined stand
and evened up matters aÂ£ 5â5. From
then on first one side was ahead and
then the other until the twenty-fourth
game, when three or four clever strokes
at the net gave the game and match
to Allen and Crawford. The score was
3â 6, 67-4, 9â7, 1J-11.
Play was resumed in the class sin
gles tournament at the park courts
yesterday. Only one match was played
in the first class. In It Will Allen de
feated Charles Dunlap, 6 â 4. 7â5. Dun
lap was not at his best and Allen had
little difficulty beating him.
The fourth class honors were won
easily by Guerin, who beat Hail in the
finals in straight sets. The score was
6â4, 6â4, 6â3.
In the second class several matches
commenced a week ago were com
pleted. Marius Hotchkiss had a lead of
a set over N. Ambrose, but the latter
won out the last two by a narrow
margin. The score was 5 â 7. 6â^4, 7 â 5.
.Oakland could not squeeze a run
through till the fourth. With two gone,
'lrwin fumbled a grounder from the bat
â¢ â¢f Krugrr. Dunleavy was passed and
before thÂ«Â» crowd had a chance to un
derstand it all. Sehafley came through
\wth a drive to right field that sent
Fi ancks in. Dunleavy was nailed as
he slid into bag three..
The seventh produced another for
Peter. Kruger accepted a pass and
l>unleavy sacrificed. Schafley fouled
1-- Meany, Kruger taking third on the
throw'in. Streib was" there with the bip
drive to right field and Kruger arrived
with the one that tied up the score.
"Oakland made the winning tally in
the oijzrhth epasm. Old Peter started
:t all with a souse past lrwin. Schmidt
s&crificed and Francks responded with
a* lofty one that ' dropped in front of
Waldron. This allowed the grand old
man to ecore the tally that counted
â¢most.
* Although Schmidt was pitching shut
out Hall all the time, he was hit freely.
The locals gathered in their safe ones
every round save the eighth, but the
twirler seemed to have them
under his mystic spell when men were
on the bags. In the ninth round, with
trio to the bench and the bags all oc
cupied, Hlldebrand smashed one at
Streib. It took a false bound and got
â¢ away from him. but Schmidt recovered
it and fielded Hilde out Just as he tor?
into the bag.
jffflll PLAYING IS FAST.
â¢ Yerkes pitched good ball all the time
and had the crowd with nim. He was
unfortunate, however, in allowing his
hits to come Just when they did the
niwist damage. Both teams fielded well.
ThÂ« game was the liveliest seen at

in the meantime the fans will have to
root for some aggregation other than
the home -team.
It looked like old times once again
â¢when that crowd of 10,000 fans began to
yell as the home team tripped lightly
out upon the green sward and lined
up for the afternoon's work. Every

and the bleachers were black with hu

of the season.

An attractive programme has been
arranged for this week at Oakland.
Among the features are handicaps for
three-year-olds and upward. There is
one for Wednesday at a mile and a
furlong and another Saturday at a mile
and a sixteenth. In addition, the spe
cial race for polo ponies will be Â«n at
traction on Saturday. ,
At 1 o'clock the ifew cup challenger
Corinthian started from the Fulton
Iron Works and sailed over to Belve
dere cove, where she took up moor-'
ings near the clubhouse.
The mainsail . of the sloop Presto
was bent onto the Corinthian's main
boom and gaff, which also car
ried the Presto's storm jib.
She started out with a reef, the
wind blowing freshly, but' stood up so
well under her canvas that the reef
was shaken out. On board the Cor
inthian were ex-Commodore J. W.
Pew, Frank Stone, Dave Dean, Doug
las Erskine and George Storey. Those
who. were aboard of her said the chal
lenger handles well and gives high
promise of great speed. The weather
looked threatening yesterday and it
was feared the Corinthian's own sails
might get a wetting. Next Sunday the
challenger will go out for a spin un
der her own canvas.
The sloops Edna, Sans Souci, Freda
and Speedwell had previously taken
up moorings in the cove. The sloops
Presto and Harpoon and the yawl
Seven Bells are at Stone's yard at
Harbor View. The sloop Phoenicia is
at Boole's yard, in Oakland Creek, un
dergoing repairs. She was greatly
in the recent heavy storm.
At 12:30 p. m. yesterday the bridge
over the entrance to Tiburon lagoon
was raised and the yachts of the Cor
inthian fleet began "to pass out into
Belvedere cove. The whole affair
went through without a hitch and with
only one delay. Owing to the strong
tide that was running, however, the
task of towing the yachts out against
it proved a longer one than usual, so
that it was nearly 2 o'clock before the
last yacht left the lagoon.
Port Captain John H. Keefe, as
sisted . by John Norby, managed the
details of the bridge raising. Almost
as soon as the draw had 'been taken
up, V. -E. Baker's sloop Emilie, with
her owner, Frank A. Bartlett, and
some friends on board, was warped
through. The little sloop Rambler
was in tow of the Emilie. Next came
the sloop Wave, towed by the launch
Leonie; the sloop Mischief, towed by
T. Jennings' launch; the sloops Tru
ant and Discovery towed by T. Jen
nings' launch; the big ,-yawl Frolic,
with C. Swain at the wheel, towed by
Forrest's launch Gazelle; the sloops
Meteor and Hiawatha, towed by T.
Jennings' launch; the sloop Emma,
towed by the launch Leonie; the
sloop Clara, towed by a launch.
Fisher's yawl Nereid then came up
to the draw in tow of a small launch,
which could hardly make headway
against the tide and wind. Before
she had got through T. Jennings'
launch,^ towing a yacht, overtook the
Nereid and it became necessary for
both launches to Â£ast off their -tows
and for the yachts to drop their an
chors. Percy Bdrr's launch Cub
towed the sloop May, with ex-Com
modore H. D. Hawks at the wheel.
Then came the sloops Neva, Neptune,
Merope and Mignon, each in tow of a
launch.' These were followed by the
sloop Amigo and the yawl Nereid,
each in tow of a launch. Westerfeld
and Morrow's sloop Aeolus came out
in tow of T. Jennings' launch.
The rest of the fleet, each yacht in
tow of a launch, passed out in the fol
lowing order: The sloops Fleetwing.
Elsie, Beaver, Wawona, Juanita and
Genesta. J. 11. Savory's sloop Juan
ita, in tow of the launch Gazelle, went
over to Sausalito. The rest of the
yachts went to their mocrings in Bel
vedere cove. V'..":

R. S. Wixson, a member of the Shell
Mound Rifle and Pistol Club, from his
recent . performances gives promise of
becoming one of the crack shots of the
coast. He led : the â¢.: second champion
class â¢ yesterday with a score of 395,
making 207 in the first ten shots and 188
in the next. In the. competitive shoot
of : three' shots he scored two tickets,
65 out of a possible 75 and. 67 out of u
possible 75. . Taking into consideration
that he can be. regarded as still a
novice his showing is excellent. Fol

money : from him' to .take him- to
Texas, hinting that if he were out of
the way a conviction could â not be
obtained. Gilmore quietly notified one
of his .'stablemen -.to /go in. search of
a policeman" and' kept Meyer in con
versation. . The ' stableman returned,
saying he was unable to 'find an of-'

iiis adherents raised a storm of op
position, which ended by the directors
walking out of the meeting, leaving
their opponents no other alternative
but to adjourn.. ' Since then , a steady
effort has been ..conducted by jthem to
capture the board -of .directors at. the
annual election, which failed yesterday.
In place of Dr. Canac-Marquis, :Dr.
Alden was installed chief surgeon last
September. V'
. The "annual report of the directors
showed 'a prosperous condition of the
society's finances itt the present time. :
The division among the members of
the society dates from last -September,
when the ' directors asked Dr. Canac-
Marquis for his- resignation as chief
surgeon at the hospital. He acquiesced
in the demand, but a large number of
his friends demanded that a special
general meeting be called to consider
the reasons for his removal. The meet
ing. was held in October, last, and the
directors gave their reasons for de
manding Dr. Canac-Marquis' resigna
tion. ', /.': : â¢N^-
It was eleven o'clock at night be
fore the ballots were counted and the
result definitely announced, although
an hour before that it was apparent
that the Bearnais ticket had won by a
heavy majority. All fifteen of the di
rectors proposed by the Bearnais fac
tion were chosen. The ticket was
headed by O. Bozio, well known in
financial circles in- this city und con
nected, hs a director, with the French-
American and Swiss-American banks.
During the last year he has acted as
llrst vice president of the society and
it is understood that when the direct
ors meet next Wednesday to choose
officers he will be selected president
for the ensuing year.
He was president from 1896 to 1898
and afterward a member of the
building committee during the four
years the present French Hospital
was being, erected. .Since 1883 he has
been a member of the society and at
times of stress has aided- it liberally
with his private means. ,
The other directors chosen to act
with Mr. Bozio are A. Gless, Thomas
Lacoste, V. Gardet, J. A. Bergerot, J.
Bergez, J. S. Godeau, C. A. Artigues,
P. Cames, A. Roncovieri, J. B. Lacaze,
J., B. Pon, B. P. Lapachet, Redmond
Aguirre and G. Pouchan. Roncovieri,
who was on both tickets, received the
highest number of votes, polling 963.
Dr. J. E. Artigues was chosen resident
physician .at the French Hospital over
Dr. J. de Chantreau by a vote of 546
to 400. Dr. F. R. Orella and Dr.
Geprge M. Converse were selected as
physicians to visit homes of mem
bers, the only other candidate being
Dr. Ed. R. Berges.
DIVISION OF SOCIETY.
Two tickets arid a bitter fight brought
out. the largest vote ever polled in the
annual election of the -French Mutual
Benefit Society, which conducts the
French Hospital. The election of di
rectors was held yesterday afternoon in
the main hall â¢ of the Native Sons'
building, and out of a membership of
more than 5000 throughout the State
1178- members .were "present .to vote. So
great was the interest in the election
that several members journeyed from
as far south as Riverside and Los An
geles to cast their ballots.
1 The victorious side was known as the
Bearnais ticket. The opposing faction
represented the forces of Dr. Canac-
Marquis, until last September chief sur
geon at the French Hospital.'
Balloting commenced at 1 o'clock,
and from then until 6 o'clodk, when the
polls closed, a steady stream of voters
poured into the hall and marked their
ballots for the candidates they chose
to direct the affairs of the society for
the ensuing year. There was an ab
sence of the usual bitterness between
the two factions, and, aside from an
occasional wordy argument between
members of the opposing forces, there
Was no disorder. Two policemen were
on duty during the afternoon and aided
in accelerating the balloting by keep
ing the members in line.
BERXAIS TICKET WINS.

Robert Barnett, formerly a leading
Democrat of this State, was shot and
instantly killed at the Taraca mine, in
Mexico, of which he was superintend
ent, yesterday afternoon by one of the
laborers in 'his employ. The report of
the tragedy came to this city in a dis
patch to Hugh Reichenbach, president
of the Taraca Gold . Mining Company,
from W. J. Hood, agent of the company
in Mexico. The message was brief and
only conveyed the information that
Barnett had been shot and killed at
the mine by one of the native laborers.
The Taraca mine is situated twelve
miles west of Torres, a station on the
Sonora branch of the Southern ; Pacific
Railway in Mexico. Reichenbach im
mediately wired for full particulars of
the crime and F. X. Collier, formerly
superintendent of Captain Delemar'a
Golden Gate j property at Mercury,
Utah, left for the scene last night to
take charge of the property. . . t
From those' acquainted with condi
tions at the mine it is believed the
crime occurred as the result of Bar
nett's discovery of the theft of ore by
one of the Mexican laborers. Consid
erable difficulty has been encountered
in tnat regard since the company has
been shipping to the Selby smelter at
Vallejo, and Barnett was watching for
the thieves.
.Barnett had been at the Taraca mine \
a little over a year as superintendent. \
Up to the time he left for Mexico he
resided in this city. Mrs. Barnett
joined her husband a short time ago
and was either at the mine or Torres at
the time of the murder.
Deceased was 55 years of age a"nd was
born of Scotch parents in Louisiana.
With his parents he removed â¢ to this
State fifty-three years ago and settled
in Colusa' County in 1851. He was a
man of sterling character and enjoyed
the "absolute confidence of all that knew
him. .
He was one of the old line Demo
crats and a leader in the party. He
served as Treasurer of Colusa County
for several years, succeeding himself
four times. In 1884 he was elected to
the Legislature from that county, but
resigned to accept the Presidential ap
pointment as Internal Revenue Collect
or for the Fourth Internal Revenue dis
trict, comprising Northrn California
and Nevada. Four years later he ac
cepted a position as chief clerk of the
United States Mint in this city under
Superintendent John Daggett of SIs
klyou.
The Norrls & Howe circus attracted
great throngs at Mechanics' Pavilion
yesterday afternoon and evening. The
show proved to be an interesting one
and the crowd encored the clever acts
often. There will be a big parade! this
iriorning, starting from the Mechanics'
Pavilion at 10 o'clock-
The Alameda Lustspiel Ensemble
gave the last of its winter season of
entertainments at the Columbia Thea
ter last night. The German play, "The
Scapegoat," was admirably presented,
and proved a great mirth provoker.
Max Horwlnski Jr.,,in the leading role
of Otto von Griebenow, showed mark
ed dramatic ability. Among the ladies
the honors were carried off- by Miss
Johanne Strausse, Mrs. Frieda Shan
ley and . Mrs. Josephine Lafontaine-
Neckhaua. Arthur Becker was .the
stage manager.
Jerry Sullivan and Walter Bramb
lette, diminutive creatures who pose as
yellow kids, will not be forgotten for
some time. The things that Sullivan
does and says are original and really
funny. His side partner, while not be
ing so conspicuous, is funny all the
same and a glance at him is enough.
Joe E. Willard, who appears in the role
of the German, has a lot to say and do
and says and does it all to the tune
of the laughter of those present. Teddy
SImonds, the king of the ward, other
wise McFadden, is a sho\v in himself
and does his share of the work. Wood
ruff Alexander, the tramp of the out
fit, has a great makeup and is a very
versatile actor.
Belle Gold and Ada Boshell, the fem
inine leading lights, make impressions.
Both act well and Miss Gold is a very
clever soubrette. The chorus is one of
the best that has ever been seen here.
Each girl is petite and winsome and
their songs are all new and catchy. The
costumes are striking and the girls ap
pear to advantage when the colored
lights are turned on them.
The funniest show that has invaded
the footllght domains of this city in
many a moon is on at the California.
They call it "McFadden's Flats" and
while the name savors of those fierce"
barnstorming productions the public
has been forced to endure time and
time again, it is a genuine 18-carat
farce comedy, full of funny sayings,
catchy songs, pretty girls and in fact
everything that one generally sees in
a real laugh-making layout.
The plot is one vast expanse of non
eense, yet that nonsense is so ridicu
lously funny and so fast and furious
that it touches the right spot and one
gees into 'convulsions of laughter in
voluntarily. There Is no particular star
in the cast â every one takes turns at
being headliner and when a multitude
of clever people get together, as in
* llcFadden's Flats," and hand out
their witticisms, they are bound to
make a hit. .
La Belle Guerrero has a new sketch
this week, "La Gitana," in ' whicliJghe is
as tlgerishly I graceful, impassioned,
vivid, as usual. The four Welsons do
some excellent acrobatic stunts, and
the rest of the numbers are yester
weeks. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
He was supposed to be able to repeat
note for note anything that was played
to him, and people were invited from
among the audience to furnish test
pieces. Needless to say, he could not
do this, but the number of right notes
he averaged, together with the gen
eral wonderful resemblance of the
transcription, was of the extraordi
nary things. However, the pianist was
excellently received last night.
Another good number on the bill, that
throughout is above the average, is
the dancing dervish Omar, in "Ah
Evening in Persia." Mr. Omar, in a
setting worthy of the Arabian nights
and a ballet skirt worthy ut Held, sets
himself spinning until every one but
himself is dizzy, and ends' up as sober
as a Buddhist bonze.
While Blind Tom may not be the
"most marvelous genius living" â per the
billboards â this negro pianist-is a quite
remarkable enough sort of person. He
reappeared here at the Orpheum last
night â It's a long lane that does not
lead to the Orpheum â after a ten
years* absence from our shores. Blind
Tom is still the big, music-ridden child
of ten years ago, with his singular and
pathetic air of an inspired Quasimodo.
His uerformance is the same and he
applauds it himself with the same
quaint and pitiful naivete. It con
sisted last nightof two solos, the quar
tet from "Kigelotto," arranged by
Lizst, and the "Gondolier Intermezzo"
that wasn't. â¢.
The selection was mistaken. Indubi
tably it* is not as a rival to Harold
,Bauer that Blind Tom shines. His play
ing, all by car, is wonderful enough, in
that way, and it is further inforrrted
with a pretty tenderness of tone and
feeling. He has, too, what would be
called a neat technique, if it had been
made in Germany, and an astonishing
memory. But as a serious pianist he
is simply not on the map. Again, what
the Orpheum wants Is the freak. Blind
Tom is the best musical freak I know.
His recitals here of ten years ago at
tracted musicians of all sorts through
h5s varied feats of memory and tone
making 1 .
