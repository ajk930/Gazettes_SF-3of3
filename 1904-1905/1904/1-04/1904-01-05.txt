A dispatch from Blzerta. Tunis, says
the Russian naval division there, or re

launched in 1883: â¢ the armored cruiser
Oslayba,' launched in 1893; the protected

The .personnel of the division consist

Trans-Siberian Railroad to St. Peters

ties of underchief .of the naval staff. A
number of the ships of this division
were still at Bizerta when the dispatch
was pent and others were near that
port, awaiting. the movement of the di
vision as a whole. The Aurora left
yesterday for the Piraeus, and five of
the torpedo-boat destroyers were re
cently at Malta. Viceroy Alexieff *s dis
patch-boat 1 had ': already started for
China. The Dimitri DonÂ«koi and the
Oslayba were at first intended to ac
company the Aurora, but Admiral WI

"There is no reason why our terri

McCLELLAX PRECEDES OLNEY.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â Democrats of
prominence from the city, State and
nation assembled here to-night at the
dinner at Sherry's in honor of George
B. McClellan, the newly installed Mayor
of New York City. Among those pres
ent were Richard Olney of Massachu

David B. Hill, was greeted with loud
applause when In his introductory re
marks he eulogized the leadership of
Charles F. Murphy and predicted that
Mayor McClellan would succeed him as
Governor of the State and precede him
in the White House.
Hill characterized the course of
President Roosevelt in the Panama af
fair as a "species of contemptible
machination unworthy of the head of a
great nation." prompted by personal
ambition and a desire to startle and
dazzle the people; part and parcel of a
political scheme to prematurely *force

BRUSSELS, Jan. 4.â The Hague cor
respondent of Lc. Petit Bleu, one of the
best informed newspapers y in Europe
on matter.! political, reports that, alÂ»
though the decision of the Internation
al Arbitration -.Court* in the Venezuelan
case will not be publisned' before Feb
ruary, it is believed Wclrdes in a posi
tion to judge that, the decision has bscn.
drawn up and that the court will deny
the contention of the blockading na
tionsâGreat Britain, Germany and
Ital3Â»â that they are to be regarded as
privileged creditors of Venezuela.
The judgment, however, will allow
the three blockading powers to first col
lect the expenses of the' blockade,
which, it will state, was undertaken in
the public interest. But after the costs
of the blockade are recovered all credi
tor nations will share alike in propor
tion to the amount "of their "adjudicated
claims. Thus, finally,, has been peace
fully arranged the complicated quarrel
which threatened to embroil the world.
During its sessions the tribunal
heard every possible argument in
vor of warlike methods and every
humane reaSoTi^why â¢ creditors -.adopt-
Ing : peaceable' mciTiods should not^ ;be
held- to have forfeited -their right to
equality' of treatment with belligerent
creditors. "~- * * â¢ ..-Â¦'
No fewer than a dozen nations were
directly interested, and eminent sup
porters of arbitration maintain that this
Venezuela case gained for The Hague
tribunal the recognition and respect
it should receive as the supreme In

tice.
Its decision will be most important
â a poisoned meat ball thrown to the
dogs of warâ for it Hvill establish a
precedent that will directly indicate

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Jan. 4.
The university opened for the first
day's registration this morning and
to-night a total of 407 students had
been enrolled, fifteen of whom were
Christmas freshmen. In comparison
with last year's figures given by Reg
istrar Elliott to-day's registration is
rather light, as 450 took out their"
registration cards on the correspond

registration ia exactly the same as
that of two years ago and does not
signify a decreased attendance, as a
large number may register to-morrow.

ganization to come under the national
agreement. Hanlon will leave for Cal

From here Dr. Browne will go to
Washington, where he will commence
the compilation of the catalogue,
while Commissioners- Fenner and -Hall
will proceed direct to St. Louis to ar
range for putting in shape the com
mercial and* agricultural attractions of
the exhibit. The major portion of the
Philippine exhibit has already arrived
in this country and is waiting the ar
rival of its custodians in St. Louis.
"If will be : the largest exhibition
from any outside country," .said Dr.
Browne yesterday, "and a most com
plete one. Upon me has devolved the
task of preparing the catalogue for
the entire exhibition, and. although I
do say it, I believe that this book,
which will be published by a Phila
delphia firm, inasmuch as it will be
the first of its kind to be issued, will
be most valuable as one of reference
to information seekers." . . '
Dr. G. d'E. Browne, Charles P. Fen-^
ner and Charles L. Hall, Philippine
commissioners to the St. Louis Exposi
tion, arrived from the Orient on the
steamship Coptic yesterday and are
registered at the Palace. Dr. Browne
Is a scientist, who has resided in the
Philippines for several years, and to
him has been assigned the work of ar
ranging the scientific features of- the
island exhibit and preparing the cata
logue of the latter. Commissioners
Fenner and Hall represent respectively
the commercial and agricultural
branches of. the exhibit.- This is the
first time in the history -of the. Philip

to exhibit their products' abroad, and,
according to" the statement of Dr."

interest in the undertaking. ' '

equally convincing as the reigning
beauty of the second act, as the woman
who, instead of sinking under the de

the part, hot unnaturally faHed here.
But Miss Block's work this week is
distinctly of her best, spirited and vital.
She carries off scenes easily absurd
With ease and eclat, and looks the part
handsomely.
Mr. Durkin has an ungrateful role as
the rakish Sir John Oxen, and looks
rather ashamed of himself. A long
course of heroics rather unfits for vil
lainy, and it was not until Sir John
threatens to betray his former lady
love that Mr. Durkln's was felt to be
anything but make believe. Rather
well assumed is the role of the Duke
of Osmcmde by Harry Hilliard. He
does not fully fill out the part of Clo
rlnda's ideal, but 'tis a pleasant and
seemly essay. Fred Butler's Sir Geof
frey Wilda.irs is excellent, and on a par
with it is the rollicking Crowell of
George Osbourne. John B. Maher has
a good moment as the chaplain, when,
surrounded by the revelers at "Wildaire,
he is forced to drink the health of the
girl he has come to rebuke. The scene
throughout does ample credit to the
actors and the stage management.
Miss Starr has but little to do this
week, but as Anne Wildairs is a sweet
and appealing figure, and Miss Gordon
is trulv modish as Lady Betty Tantil-
Hon. In fact, the sins of the Alcazar's
"Lady of Quality" are inherent in Mrs.
Burnett's and Mr. Townsend's play,
and, though these" are not few, there
is a dash and freshness about the piece
that carries it brightly along.

As Clorinda Wildairs, the dashing

quite Miss Adele Block's turn at the
Alcazar this week. The part fits her

Coroner Leland remarked that every

Concerning the criminality of tarn-'

in their beds, Coroner Leland yesterday;
spoke his mind to the jurj^and officially
informed the police, authorities that
several hundred persons taking' in
lodgers are in the habit^of violating or
dinance No. 642. He suggested that the
police arrest all persons using so-called
gas regulators, which practically set
the ordinance at rjaught.
The; matter came up in the course, of
the inquest upon the bodies of I. Mura
kama and T. Kawahata, Japanese, who
were suffocated by illuminating gas on
December 20 in a lodging-house at 416
O'Farrell street; conducted by Mrs."
Kate Mellick."" Less than four, months
ago>a. white, man and a white woman
were suffocated in bed in the same
house.' Mrs. Mellick â¢ testified that she
used a Â¦ "gas regulator" furnished by
the United States Gas Regulating Com
pany. The regulator is placed between
the meter and the burner, and she said
that she had boen in the habit of in
creasing the pressure and flow of the
fluid by, placing weights on the regu
lator whenever she wanted to cook on
her gas range, and that when she fin
ished her cooking she used to take off
the weights to refluce the pressure and
to prevent waste. She swore that she
had : not done any cooking while the
Japanese were in their room and had
her meals sent in from the outside.
It was in evidence that when all the
weights were put on and the pressure
increased the gas jet flared so strongly
as to crack the glass shade, and. that it
was possible to extinguish the jet by
taking off the weights."- ' ; * '

It is apparent that there is a grow

House Member Charges in Bristol's
Report Investigated. >\ ' :
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â With the re
assembling of Congress to-day after the
recess the chaplain of. the House in*
opening the session of that body "prayed
that war between Russia "and Japan
migrht be averted by a peaceful adjust
ment of their differences.
A privileged resolution offered by Hay
(Democrat) of Virginia recited that
certain statements contained in the
Bristow postoflice report reflected upon
the membership of the. House. 'It pro
vifled for an investigation bv a commit
tee to be appointed-by theSJpeaker. A
point of -order made-against the resolu
tion by Gardner was overruled, and the*
same fate met Payne (Republican) ot
New York, who desired to refer the res
olution to the Postofflce Committee.. A
vote on ordering the previous question
developed no quorum, and the House
adjourned. , Hay's privileged resolution
was as follows:
Â¦â¢" Whereas. The Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General, , in his â¢ report to the Postmaster : Gen
eral, dated October 24, 1003, and which report
has . been transmitted to a committee of this
House, has charged . that long leases for. post
office premises were canceled and rents In
creased upen the recommendation of - Influen
tial representatives; and.
Â¦\Vhnreaa, It is charged in the same report
that " If ; a ' member Â¦ of Congress requested that
Increased clerk " hire . be Â¦ allowed ' a Â¦ postmaster.
Beavers: usually complied, , regardless* of the
merits of the case; and.; ; ....
Whereas,' Certain cases' of an aggravated
character are : cited on pages 136. 135, , 134 of
Â«aid report to sustain the above charge*; and.
Wherea?. On page 145 of eald report it Is
charged that memters cf Congress have vio
lated 8ection-3"S0 of the Revised Statutes and
ih*t ln face of the statute Beavers has made
contracts with members of Congress for % the
rental pf premises either. Jn their own names,
the names of their agents or some members
of-tbeir families: anfl. ,
Whereas, These charges and others con
tained in said report reflect upon the Integrity
of the membership cf this House and upon Indi
vidual member of this House, whose, names
ere not mentioned ; therefore, be It
Resolved, That the Speaker of this House
appoint a committee consisting of five mem
bcrs of this House to investigate said charges;
that nld committee, have power to send for
persons and papers to enforce the production ot
the same; to examine witnesses under oath;
to have assistance of a stenographer and to
have p^wer to !Â«it during the sessions of the
House and to exercise all functions necessary
to a complete, investigation of said charges and
to rep.ort the . result of raid investigation as
boon as practicable.
Gardner (Republican) of New Jersey
raised a point of order, contending that
there was no specific charge against
any member of this Congress. Hay
contended that the resolution was priv
ileged, and he was supported by Wil
liams of Mississippi.. the minority lead
er.'' Grosvenor (Republican) of Ohio
asked Hay; if it would not be better to
adopt a resolution calling'on the fourth
Assistant : Postmaster General for the
names of Congressmen, but Hay insist
ed upon .his 'resolution. The Speaker
overruled the point . of order.
Payne ; (Republican ) ' of New York
asked if ., It; would; be in order to move
to refer, the resolution to the Committee
on Postoffices, but was informed that
it would not. -
Â¦On Hay's that the previous
question be. ordered on the adoption of
the, resolution^ the Speaker announced
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, Jan. 4.â
The National Guard has been called
out.
A~ dispatch from Montevideo, dated
January 2, announced that a re jlution
had broken out in the Department of
Florida and tha^the Government was
sending trooDS and war- munitions to

It was announced from Buenos Ayres
last nisht that a dispatch had been
received there saying a revolutlc-n had
been declared in the Department of
Maldonado, Uruguay, and that a state
of siege had been proclaimed through

The revolutionary movement is un
derstood to be due to the white, party,

Special Dispatch to The C*H. %
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 4.â Lieutenant
Governor Alden Anderson, who has re
turned from an eastern trip, to-day ex
pressed great disappointment over the
location of the California building at
the SL Louts exposition. Mr. Anderson
said:
"I regret very much that the Cali
fornia building is not located in a more
accessible -part of the fair grounds. I
do not know why the present site was
selected, but it is in the most remote
and inaccessible part of the grounds
and upon a hill.
"It is on the opposite side of the
grounds from the entrance, and nearly
two- miles away, I should judge. Thi-'Â»
is to be regretted, particularly In view
of the fact that California will make an
exhibit of unusual merit, and we were,
in my Judgment, in a position to de
mand the very best location."

levying blackmail on the nations of the

"We have the right of way now for
the canal." concluded Stewart. "The
people want the canal, and." turning to
the Democratic side of the chamber,
"you had better get on the band
wagon, because it is moving. The peo
ple don't care anything about that little
band of robbers at Bogota and we are
going to build the canal, and I am go
ing to try and live until the canal is
constructed."
Morgan said that the message, of the
President to-day contained no new rec
ommendations.
"It seems to be an argument against
the resolutions and remarks of the
senior Senator from Massachusetts
(Hoar) and of remarks pf Senators on
this s?ide of the chamber," he said. _
FEARS PRESIDENT'S POWER.
He (Morgan) might yield in his judg
ment that no ship could ever pass
through the isthmus of Panama, but he
could not assist in the breaking down
of our fixed policy of neutrality between
belligerents or in enlarging the diplo
matic powers of the President until
they reached a stage of usurpation on
the part of the executive. _
Morgan said that his colleagues could
not fail to see that the President's atti
tude was intended to force them to vote
for the Panama route. TFor himself, he
was not opposing the President on
slight grounds, but because he believed
the course of the President to be. such
as to threaten the integrity of the
United States. 'He argued- that, ac
cording to precedents, the de facto gov
ernment of Panama had no right to
transfer territory, but he declared that
the President knew that only by his
recognition of Panama could he acquire
a concession there. Indeed, he asserted,
in the prospect of securing this acquisi
tion was found the only motive for the
President's recognition. He said that,
instead of the rising: being as of one
man. as declared by the President, -it
had been a rising of eight men, who for
months had been in. conspiracy against
the real people of Panama. He declared
that President Roosevelt's interference
in Colombia's affairs on the isthmus
was unjustified by the constitution, and
asserted that if there was to be a gen
eral policy on the part of the United
States of upholding civilization, that
policy must be undertaken by Congress
and "not left to blaze on the lance of
some individual American Sancho
Panza to be thrust Into the bosom of 'a
friendly pal."
BUNAU-VARILLA'S PROPHECY.
For one, he would not vote to ratify
the wrong done by, the. President, who,
he added, desired this ratification , to
justify what he and the Panama junta
had done.'
"And for what purpose?" asked Mor
gan. "He wants the assistance of the
Democratic Senators to do what he and
his. party, cannot do."
Morgan read an article from a Paris
oajjer.' printed last September, . and of
which. Morgan said. Minister Bunau-
Varilla was the author. The articje
purported to outline the President's
plans with reference to the Panama
canal. That**artlcle, Morgan declared,
was a correct forecast of the message
which to-day had been sent to the Sen
ate. - I'
"How," he asked, ."did that inflated
Frenchman become possessed of the se
cret of the President's policy if riot
through the President himself?"
He appealed to the Senate to stand
by the Spooner law, and declared that
the President's course wc.s as if he were
above the law.
"That law is," he said, "in the way
of his personal ambition, and he spurns
It with contemptuous indifference."
As for himself, he could not see the
President join hands wit:, the Panama
conspirators not without sorrow, but
without shame,, for he was not one of
those "who bend, the pregnant hinges of
the knee that thrift may follow 'fawn
ing." *v:~i : S
He predicted that, even though the
Government of the United States
should undertake the construction, of
the Panama canal, a canal would be
first built over the Nicaragua route be
cause of Its superior feasibility. He
again referred to President McKinley's
attitude toward the canal routes, and
declared that Nicaragua has, a better
friend In the grave of William McKin
ley than Panama has In the present
head of the American army and navy."

ment house. Officers are, however,

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â The Presi
dent to-day sent to the Senate the nom

the policy which had been pursued.
McCcmas defended the President and
asserted that his action would stand if
tried in court.
Stewart of Nevada severely criticized
the Bogota Government for its selfish
action in preventing construction of the
canal.
Morgan of Alabama stated his prefer
ence for the Nicaragua route, and
maintained that the present course of
the administration was breaking down
the established policy of the United
States regarding neutrality.'
Rev. Edward Everett Hale pronounced
the invocation on the convening of the
Senate. Dr. Hale, who was elected
chaplain just before the Holiday recess,
wore ecclesiastical robes. In the invo
cation he referred to the recent death
ot Mrs. Hoar in these words:
"Remember those in great sorrow
who have seen the last of those they
lore."
The Chicago disaster also was touched
upon in the prayer as "the city in trib
ulation and trial."
McCOMAS OPENS DEBATE.
Following the reading of the Presi
dent's message McComas of Marj-Iand
began a. discussion of the isthmian sit
uation, in which he characterized the
message as "a clearly cogent and
abundantly convincing presentation of
the situation."
Morgan interrupted with a question
to bring out the point, as he held, that
the recognition of the republic was sim
ply de facto.
McComas held otherwise, maintain
ing that the recognition was "official"
and would be held so by the courts.
Culberson questioned the right of the
executive to make such recognition, hut
McComas maintained positively that
the executive had such authority, and
said he could bring to the attention of
the Senate two instances in which the
same power had been exercised. Till
man wanted the instances cited, and
McComas promised to present them
later. â¢ ?
"But I want to know," broke in Till
nian, "whether the Senator contends
that the executive, without the instruc
tion of the Congress, can employ the
army and navy to defend his executive
action by warning away and prevent
ing Colombia asserting her supremacy
anywhere except on the Panama rail
road."
In answer McComas referred Tillman
to the closing statement of the Presi
dent's message.
BACON ASKS QUESTIONS.
Bacon inquired how long the new re
public would last should the sustaining
power of the United States be with
drawn.
"For many years," replied McComas.
He added that but for the restraining
power of the United States the inde
pendence of Panama would have been
\ established long ago.
i "Will the Senator state the respective
i population of Panama and Colombia?"
asked Bacon.
"Panama has about 200.000 and Co
lombia 4,500.000," wag the reply.
â¢ "And yet the Senator thinks the S00.-
I 000 could maintain themselves against
the 4,500,000?" again interjected Bacon.
"Such things are frequent events in
history," was the reply, and JlcComas
mentioned the contest of Japan, with
35.000.000 population, * against China,
with 400,000,003; also Montenegro's suc
cessful contest of two centuries. k
McComas, addressing the Democratic
side, declared that some excellent men
had made a political blunder and had
mistaken their partisanship for a moral
tense. He added that this opposition
was not only unpatriotic, but that it
was perversely, persistently wrong.
STEWART'S BLUNT SPEECH.
Stewart followed with an Indorsement
of the course of the administration on
the Panama question, although, he said,
he had formerly been in favor of the
Nicaragua route. Stewart declared
that the object of Colombia was to de
lay matters until the expiration of the
French canal concession. - â¢ - - < "

cess was devoted entirely to Panama.
President Roosevelt sent a message on
the subject, which was received with
great interest.^ Discussion continued
throughout * the day, speeches being

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4. â Senator
Foraker, a member of the Committee
on Military Affairs, in executive ses
sion to-day submitted a brief in favor
of Brigadier General Wood's confirma
tion" to be major general. Eight of the
eleven members of the committee have
concurred in this" report. Senators
Hawley, Proctor, Quarles, Warren and
Alger (Republicans) and Cockrell , and
Pettus (Democrats) voted for a favor
able report, while Senators Scott (Re
publican) and Blackburn (Democrat)
voted against confirmation. Senators
Hawley 'and Proctor were absent and
voted by proxies, and the vote of Sena
tor Bates will be recorded when he re
turns to Washington to-morrow.-
Senator . Foraker's report contains
more than lift) printed pages and deals
with all the evidence introduced in the
exhaustive investigation conducted by
the Senate Committee on Military Af
fairs. It also covers Jhe 167 army nom
inations held up pending action on Gen
eral Wood's nomination.
TAKES UP EACH CIIARGE.
In his report Senator Foraker quotes
the charges which were filed by Major
Esteg G. Rathbone against General
Wood and says that every witness be
fore the commission was allowed to
testify as to any fact of which he
might have knowledge, but that with
all this latitude the witnesses had been
unaBle to support the charges made,
while in most instances the facts had
brought out that the witnesses were
holding real or fancied grievances
against General Wood, which made
them biased in their .views to an ex
tent apparent to the members of the
commission.
Each charge is taken up by Sena
tor Foraker in its turn. The orders
General Wood is said to have is3ued
to the courts in the Rathbone case, it
is argued 1 , were wholly within the
province and duty of General Wood
as Governor General. In the postal
cases, it is declared, the testimony
showed General Wood to be following
the instructions is3ued by the Secre
tary of War. The report declares
that no evidence was offered to the
commission to show that Major
Rathbone was not given a fair trial
in Cuba.
THOSE JAI ALI GIFTS.
In regard to the gifts which General
AVood accepted from the Jai All Com
pany, the "report says that "in the
mere fact that General Wood accept
ed gifts from the Jai Ali Company
there is nothing to be criticized," and
adds that General Wood's acceptance
was with the full knowledge of Sec
retary Root. The question of the ad
mission of the silver service to Cuba
free of duty is summed up in one
paragraph taken from the testimony
of General Tasker Bliss, as follows:
"It was admitted free of duty, but
I take all responsibility for that upon
myself. I never v heard a word from
General Wood on the subject."
Reference is made in the brief to
the connect of testimony in regard to
the Runcie article, and the word
of Major Runcie is placed against
that of Ray Stannard Baker, the
magazine writer, and General Wood,
both of whom have declared that the
article was not talked of at a dinner
at Santiago, as reported "by Major
Runcie.
WOOD AND BELLAIRS.
- The charges made by Major Rathbone
that General "Wood had been unduly
intimate with . an ex-convlct. Captain
Â¦Rellairs, are .pronounced by Senator
Foraker to be seemingly only spiteful
and malicious declarations, made with
out excuse of any kind in a spirit of re
venge and wanton vilification.
The testimony, of Secretary Root is
quoted at length to refute the charge
that General Wood had improperly, if
riot corruptly, granted what is known
as the Castenada concession.
It is declared that the charges made
by General Brooke that General Wood
was guilty ef Â¦ insubordination were
proved to be without foundation, and it
is added "that General Wood was fully
sustained by the War Department and
the President as to all points of differ
ence between him and General Brooke."
Senator Scott is preparing a state
ment which will give the reasons of the
minority members of the committee for
voting against a favorable report on
the nomination.
OMAHA. Jan. 4.â A legal battle pre
faced the trial in the Federal court or
United States Senator Charles H. Die
trich, charged with alleged conspiracy
with Jacob Fisher. Postmaster at Hast
ir!Â£v. Neb., to violate the statute against
bribery, and also with the direct viola
tion of that law. Counsel for Dietrich
scored the first victory on a demurrer
filed by Genera! Cowin to the . indict
ment, attacking its sufficiency and al
leging: that it would have the effect of
placing the Senator on trial twice on
the same charge. Judge Vandeventer
announced for the court that the de
murrer was sustained.
This ruling quashed the conspiracy
indictment against Senator Dietrich. It
was on this indictment that the Gov
ernment had prepared itself for trial
and to testify in which a large number
of witnesses had been subpenaed and
were present in the city. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦:*.
Aside from the indictment charging
the Senator with profiting by the leas
sng of a building to the United States
Government while a member of Con
gress, there gtill remains an Indictment
charging him directly with bribery in
connection with the appointment of a
Postmaster at Hastings.
The court set for trial to-morrow the
case wherein Senator Dietrich is
charged with benefiting by a contract
with the Government for the leasing of
a building wherein, was located the
postoff.ee at Hastings. Senator Die
trich's counsel asked for permission to
withdraw the plea of not guilty and en
ter a demurrer to the indictment in the
case on the ground that no offense was
charged. General Cowin briefly argued
th** motion. The court took it under ad
visement until to-morrow morning.

PREPARING TO FIGHT
THE WATER COMPANY*
BAN JOSE. Jan. 4.-The executive
committee cf the Home Protective As
sociation, composed of land owners who
propose to fight the diversion of water
from this county, has sent a letter of
inquiry -to the Bay Cities Water Com
pany in negard to its plans. It states
that the lands of the members of the
association are supplied with an untlei
rround water supply from the Coyote
River. The committee wants to know
if the Bay Cities Company proposes to
divert a large valume of water of the
Coyote River, and for what purpose. It
sleo asks where the Â¦waters are to be
.used and the extent and character of
the boring*, excavations â¢ and tunnels
now being made at Coyote station. The
committee also wants to know, what
amount of water will be taken from
the Coyote, Uvas and Llagas water
sheds, and if the said . diversion of
Â¦*ater diminishes the underground
v.ater supply will the company con
tinue the work. These questions are
.submitted in an endeavor to find out
the plans of the company before bring

E. J. Baldwin, who' arrived a few
days ago from Los AnÂ£eles, tells of the
rapid and phenomenal growth of that
section of Southern California sur
rounding the metropolis of the south.
Baldwin attributes the remarkable re
cent activity in rear estate and building
circles in the suburbs of Los Angeles
io the excellent system of electric rail
roads that are now In operation and in
course of construction for miles into the
country, all around the city, and pri
marily to the low rates of fare that the
railroads running into Los Angeles
have established of late, enabling tour
ists from the East to get to California
cheaply and see for themselves the
wonders of her soil. Baldwin said:
Never, in all of my travels ha.ve I 6Â«en a
city with bo many improvements going on as
are at present being made ia and about Los
Angeles. The new racetrack, known as Ascot
Park, is accountable -for the rapid growth
cf the section of, the city in uhieh it lies.
There are" seven electric lines running to the
park ar,d all of the suburban lines have built
their roads; so as to touch' It. Property has
risen in value more than double since the pro

Joseph Mcllwaine. the only son and
heir of the late "Jose Mcllwaine and
Margaret Mcllwaine, has commenced
a contest of his mother's will as a start
in a battle to establish his right, a3 the
onry child, to an Interest In the fortune
his father and mother left. By a com
bination of circumstances young Mc
llwaine stands absolutely disinherited
and dependent entirely upon the whim
or discretion of James H. Jellett, an at
torney of San Francisco, who is named
in one of the wills* as sole trustee and
executor of the father's estate, without
bonds. -
The contest which was filed to-day in
behalf of the son by Attorney .A. P.
Leach alleges that the mother was of
unsound mind. The circumstances in
volved run back "to the father's will,
wherein he left his estate to Jellett, as
trustee, with authority to sell all of it
and convert it into cash. Mrs. Mcll
waine was to have a life income in the
estate. The only exception was, that
Jellett was granted authority to pay
such an amount as he deemed advisable
to the son for his support, and at the
son's death Mcllwaine's sisters In the
East were to receive the residue.
Mcllwaine was a wealthy Pennsyl
yanian who made a- fortune in San Sal
vador as an architectural draughts
man. He accumulated various proper
ties and settled in Oakland in, 1900.
establishing a home at 517 Eighteenth
street. There the parents resided until
July 31. 1903, when the father died
rather unexpectedly. The will was
shortly afterward produced by Jellett
who is of the San Francisco law firm
of Jellett & Myer stein, and probated.
Jellett assumed the duties of executor
and trustee. Mrs. Mcllwaine decided
that she would take the life income in
the estate rather than one-half of the
property, to which she was entitled.
But five days before her death she
changed her mind and revoked her
waiver of the community interest.
Mrs. Mcllwaine died in November.
Her son at once applied for letters of
administration on her estate, but was
blocked. Trustee Jellett came into
court with a will in which Mrs. Mclil
waine gave all of her Interest In her
husband's estate to the same sisters the
husband had mentioned. This will re
cited that no provision had been made
for the son because he was amply pro
vided for by the husband's will. Jel
lett was named as sole executor with
out bonds of the mother's will.
But he declined to act, because of the
conflict of interests, John .Lewis,
through Attorney I. F. Chapman, being
naraca. and filing a petition for letters
-of "administration with the mother's
will annexed.
Now comes the son with his contest.
And this is but preliminary to a legal
battle that will be made to smash both
wills, and to establish the son's claims
to a share in his parents' fortune,
worth, it is estimated, at least- 5200,000.
Young Mcllwaine, according to his
father's wili, had been reckless in finan
cial matters, and for that reason was
put under control of a trustee. But the
voung man claims that since Jellett as
sumed the office he hes not received a
penny for support, vras refused even
the money necessary to get garments to
make a presentable appearance at his
mother's funeral, and has been other
wise kept without means of livelihood.
More than that. Mcllwaine declares
that by means of a suit brought in the
Superior Court, Jellett is trying to com
pel the son to surrender the household
furniture at the place on Eighteenth
street, though the young man asserts it
was a gift to him from his dying
mother. â¢
As matters now confront the son, he
declares he cannot get a cent from
Trustee Jellett. who has. under the
wills, absolute control over the two
estates' In so far as the contestant is
concerned. Concerning the claim that
the mother was not sound mentally,
the story is told that in 18S0 her mind
was seriously' affected by a \ sudden
fright while she was very low from a
tropical fever in San Salvador. A na
tive servant of her husband ran amuck
and ' smashed into the sick woman's
chamber, causing the patient a. very se
vere shock.
â¢ Further than that, Mcllwaine has in
hand an'attack on his father's will, the
details of which are in the bands of
Attorney Leach.
General interest was aroused in San
Francisco and throughout the State
yesterday by The Call's exclusive an
nouncement that a system of wireless
telegraphy had been installed between
the Farallones and Point Reyes. Great
satisfaction was felt Â»liat the experi
ment h*l proved an unqualified suc
cess and that CaJIfornia was to :eap
material benefits therefrom.
Professor McAdie held an ali day's
reception at his offices on the tenth
floor, of the Mills building yesterday.
His callers one and all gavft aim the
heartiest congratulations an& wished
him continued success.
The military and naval authorities
were particularly interested in the re
sult of the scientist's labors. Employes
in each of these departments of the
Government have been striviifg to ac
compliih the successful installation of
a system of "wireless 'telegraphy and.
although there is naturally some dis
appointment that the" Weather Bureau
has beaten them, the representatives
of both departments are gratified that
the Government will receive the bene
fits of the Inventions. . Â¦
The commercial j men are exultant.
They realize what the application of
McAdie's system to the ships -of this
port means for the exporters and im
porters directly and the wholesalers
and retailers indirectly. The Call was
everywhere praised for. its great fight
for wireless -telegraphy on this coast
and the victory which comes with the
achievement of the Weather Bureau
experts. There was a considerable
amount of talk among the commercial
men yesterday suggestive of the erec
tion of the necessary apparatus for
wireless telegraphy on Lime Point, thus
making the chain of communication
complete.
LIVES MAY BE SAVED.
Shipping men are anxious to have the
new system put into working shape as
speedily as possible. As soon as the
practicability of the scheme is estab
lished steps .will undoubtedly be taken
to equip vessels of this port with the
necessary apparatus. Wireless teleg
raphy in â¢general use at San Francisco
will probably result in the saving not
only of property but of many, lives.
When a ship is in communication with j
parties ashore the chances of getting
out of trouble are much better than if ,
the vessel's officers have to rely merely
on their own resources.
The facility in transmitting .urgent j
messages and the speed of dispatching !
mails which will be. gained by the j
adoption of the new system of commun
ication are benefits which wlllbe par
ticularly appreciated by the people at
large. The ranchers and the fruit grow
ers also fully realize what a material
benefit they will receive by the gen-,
eral use of wireless telegraphy at the
port of San Francisco. The "Weather
Bureau with its then acquired facilities
for gathering meteorological data will
be able much better than now to fore
cast the fair days and the rainy.
In case of war the public will feel j
much better protected from an enemy ,
with the knowledge that the army and
navy will have plenty of warning of the j
approach of a hostile fleet. The scien- j
tists are extremely anxious to . learn j
how McAdie and Thiessen, his assist- |
ant, managed to get their system to j
working in a practical way.
SECRECY IS ORDERED.
The Washington authorities, for rea- ,
sons that may easily be surmised, have â¢
ordered that no information of the j
character of the important Inventions ;
applied In the new system be given out. ;
Patents will be taken out on every one j
of the delicate pieces of machinery;
which are original with McAdie and j
Thiessen. The combinations of certain :
chemicals, the method of arranging
certain electrical apparatus and the j
working formulae will â¢ be kept secret j
until such time as the Government of- i
ficials may wish to have the public j
know how it has all been done.
It is likely that the Weather^ Bureau
will establish another station hear the
entrance to the harbor at an early date.
Military and naval officials will soon
inspect McAdle'a plant on orders from
Washington for the purpose of study
ing the practicability of using the new j
system in active warfare.
It is expected that McAdie will be re
lieved from his arduous duties as chief
of the local branch of the Weather Bu
reau and given directions to spend his
en,tire time and "devote the whole of his
attention to wireless telegraphy. The
professor states thai he will not request
that he be transferred to duty in the
new field. He feels, nevertheless, that
he could do better work on his proposed
improvements If he could give his un
divided attention to them. The men
who are interested in what McAdie
may further accomplish in the science
of wireless telegraphy are anxious that
he be temporarily relieved from duty
as district forecaster.
JJNE WORKS PERFECTLY.
The new line worked perfectly all day
yesterday. Thiessen and Hobbs were
sending and receiving messages at tne
Farallones and Thompson" was engaged
in the same work at Point Reyes. Since
the thing first began to work the oper
ators have been, able to see how they
could improve the service. Before mes
sages were transmitted first the diffi
culty was in discovering where the
hitch was.
The Weather Bureau's cable line got
out of order yesterday, and. the only
means of communication between the
inhabitants of the Farallones and the
mainland was by means of the wireless
telegraph. Every piece of apparatus is
in -working shape. Thlessen and Mc-
Adie expect to make improvements in
insulation and to cause the receiver to
keep more constant."
The weather conditions are said not
to affect the successful operation of the
electrical instruments, and this Is one
bf= the best features of the system.;
ALAMEDA, Jan. 4.â Efforts made by
interested persons to-night to hasten
action on the part of the City Trustees
in reopening the matter of the two rail
road franchises did not meet with the
general approval of the four members
of the municipal board present at the
meeting of the local lawmakers.
Attorney George T. "Wright, his broth
er-in-law. H. M- Landsberger. and Da
vid Hirschfeld appeared before the City
Trustees for the purpose of urging im
mediate action on the franchises which
were offered the Southern Pacific Com
pany and refused by that corporation.
Wright said: "This matter should be
brought to a finish. The City Trustees
should settle the franchise question
once and for all."
"We have done our best to settle the
matter." interrupted City Trustee C. J.
Hammond. "We offered the Â¦ franchises
to the Southern Pacific Company once
and they refused. If the corpora
tion BtlU desires the privileges It Is In
order for It to come to us. and not for
us to go to the company."
Hirschfeld remarked: "I wouM give
the franchise to the Southern Pacific
Company for fifty or for a hundred
years if It would settle this matter. I
have land to sell, but cannot sell It un
til the franchises are finally disposed
of. It will not shut out competition to
award these franchises to the Southern
Pacific Company. We will have oppo
sition passenger service within, eighteen
months from the Realty Syndicate.'*
No action was taken by the City Trus
tees with respect to the franchises, and
there was a disposition on the part of
the municipal legislators to allow the
status of the rejected privileges to re
main as it is.
City Trustee Dr. H. M. Pond moved to
have the Chief of Police instructed to
remove all nickel-in-the-slot machines,
saying' that every â¢well-regulated mu
nicipality was abolishing the use of
such gambling devices within its limits.
There was no second to Dr. Pond's mo
tion. He will again bring the matter
before his colleagues at a meeting of
the committee of the whole.

After arrest Otto Roeski confessed

for the property of the new Panama Canal
Company. That the attempt to carry out. this
scheme would have brought Catombia into
conflict with the Government of France can
not be d.-.ubted: nor could y.e United States
have counted upon an immunity from the
consequences of the attack, even apart from
the indefinite delays to which the constructed
canal was to be subjected. On the first' ap

'I confidently maintain' that the recognition
of the republic of Panama was an act justified
by the Interests of collective civilization. If
ever a Government could be said to have re
ceived a .mandate from civilization to effect
an object the accomplishment of which was
demanded in tbe Interests of mankind, the
United States holds that position with regard
to the Interoceanic canal. Since our purpese

there have come from, all quarters assurances
of approval and encouragement, in which' even
Colombia herself at one time participated; and
to general assurances were added specific acts

affirm that there Is nothing of greater cr

tion of an Interoceanic canal. Long acknowl
edged to be essential , to our commercial de
velopment it has become, as the result of the
recent extension of our territorial dominion,
more than ever essential to our national self
defense. The establishment of easy and speedy
communication by between the Atlantic
and the Paciflc presents Itself not simply a.Â«
somelMne to be desired, but aa an ebjee to
be positively and promptly attained. Reasons
of convenience have been superseded by reasons
of vital necessity , which do not of in
definite delays.
VAST INTERESTS
OF
IN THE BALANCE
The President then cites the fact that
the Panama Canal Commission of the
Colombian Senate had, on October 14
last, recommended that the discussion
of a law to authorize the Government
to enter upon new negotiations be in
definitely postponed, that the subject
be deferred until October, 1904. By
that, time, the committee urged, the
extension of time granted to the new
Panama Company by treaty in 1S93
Would have expired and the new Con
gress to meet in October, 1904, would,
be in a position to take up the ques
tion whether the company had not, in
spite of further extension that had
been granted by legislative acts, for
feited its property and rights.
"When that time arrives," the re
port significantly declares, says the
President, "the republic, without any
impediment will be able to contract
and will be in more clear, more defi
nite and more advantageous posses
sion, both legally and materially."
President Roosevelt says: '
It was under these circumstances that the

creiznty of the isthmus.
voke the intervention of the United
States. He Continues:
The President says that long before
the conclusion of the Hay-Herran
treaty the course of events had shown
that a canal must be built by the
United States or not at all. Neverthe
less, when the well considered agree
ment was rejected by Colombia and
the revolution had ensued, one of
Colombia's first acts has been to in-

ment was only a means to the accomplishment
of a yet more important end. The great design
of 'the article was to assure the dedication of
the isthmus to the purpose of free and unob
structed Interoceanic transit, the consummation
of which would be found in an interoceanic ca
nal. To the accomplishment of this object the
Government of the United States had for years
directed its diplomacy.
Referring to the treaty of 1S46, ':by
the thirty-fifth article of which the
United States secured the right of a
free and open transit across the isth
mus of Panama and to that end agreed
to guarantee to New Granada Her
rights of sovereignty and property
over that territory," the President
said:
By the unanimous action of its people, with
out firing a shotâ with a unanimity hardly
before recorded in any similar case â the peo
ple of Panama declared themselves an Inde
pendent republic. Their recognition by this
Government was based upon a state of facts
In no way dependent for its justification upon
our action in ordinary cases. I have net de
nied, nor do I wish to deny, either the valid
ity or the propriety of the general rule that
a new state should not be recognized as In
dependent until it has shown its ability to
maintain Its lndenender.ee. This rule is de
rived from . the principle of non-intervention,
and as a corollary cf that principle,
has generally been observed by the
United States. But like the principle from
which it Is deduced, the rule Is subject to ex
ceptions, and there are In my opinion clear and
imperative reasons why a departure, from It
was justified and even required In the recent
instance. -These reasons embrace â first; our
treaty rights; eecond, our national interests
and safety, and third, the interests of collec
tive civilisation.

was for the peace of both Colombia and
Panama. It is earnestly to â¢ be .'hoped
there will be no unwise conduct' on our
part which may encourage Colombia to
embark on a war which cannot result
in her regaining control of the isthmus,
but which may cause much bloodshed
and suffering. I
I hesitate to refer to the injurious insinua
tions which have been made of complicity by
this Government In the revolutionary movement
in Panama. They are as destitute of founda
tion aÂ« of propriety. The only excuse for my
mentioning them Is the fear lest unthinking
persons might mistake for acquiescence the
silence of mere self-respect: I think proper
to eay. therefore, that no one connected wiU)
th!Â«> Government had any part In preparing:,
inciting or encouraging the late revolution
on the Isthmus of Panama, and that save
from the reports of "our military and naval of

REASONS ARE GIVEN
FOR RECOGNITION
OF NEW REPUBLIC
Failure to act as the administration
acted would have meant great waste of
life, great suffering, great destruction
of property,- all of which' was avoided
It thus clearly appears that the fact
that there was r.o bloodshed on the
isthmus was directly dueâ and only due
âto the prompt and firm enforcement
by the United States of its traditional
policy. During the past forty years
revolutions and attempts at revolution
have succeeded one another with mo
notonous regularity onjhe isthmus, and
again and again United States sailors
and marines have been landed as they
were landed in this instance and under
similar instructions to protect transit.
One of these resolutions resulted ' in
three years of warfare, and the aggre
gate uf bloodshed and misery caused
by them has been incalculable. The
fact that in this last revolution not "a
life was lost, save that of the men
killed by the shells of the Colombian
gunboat, and no property destroyed,
was due to the action which I have de
scribed. We. in effect, policed the isth
mus in the interests of its inhabitants
and of our own national needs and for
the good of the entire, civilized world.
The President then quotes from an
article in the New York Evening Post
under date of Panama, December 8,
in which in an interview a native Pan
aman is quoted as saying:
TVe were willing to encounter the Colombian
troops at Colon and fight It out, but the com
mander of thj United States cruiser Xashville
forbid Superintendent Shaler to allow the rail
road to transport troocs for eithor party.
. This r>is.ln official account of thf occurrences
of November 4 f.hows that. Instead of there
having been too much Drovlslons by tbe Ameri
can Government for the maintenance of order
end the prelection of life and property on
the Isthmus; the orders for the movement of
the American warships had been too Ions
delayed, so long. In fact, that there were but
forty-two marines and sailors available to
land and protect the lives cf American men
and women. It was only the coolness and the
gallantry with which this little band of men

"Control.has now been obtained, the provision of the act has been complied with; .it is
no longer possible, under existing legislation, to go to tlte Nicaragua route as an alternative.'^
He quotes former Secretary Cass in support of his own attitude, -and plainly intimates
that Europe is barred from participating in the canal construction. The provision rqade in the
Ilay-Pauncefote treaty that all nations should use the canal, which should be policed by the
United States, was in effect a guarantee to all the world that" the canal would be constructed.
The President says Colombia lost all. by rejecting the Hay-Herran treaty. Such refusal,
therefore, squarely raised the question whether Colombia was entitled to bar the transit of the
world's traffic across the isthmus. / -.
He says the Nicaragua route is impossible, as Congress has already decided upon
Panama. ... '
No one connected with the United States Government had any part in preparing or en
couraging the Panama revolution, says the. message. Recognition of the Panama republic was

p ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREEY, N; W.; WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.. -The Presi-
V^ dent's special message to Congress to-day deals with the Panama affair exclusively. The
NICARAGUA ROUTE NO LONGER
CONSIDERED, SAYS PRESIDENT
Secretary Hay on December SO. 1903.
acknowledged a letter from General
Reyea. which had asked him to say
whether the invasion of the territory
of the republic of Panama by Colom
bian soldiers would be considered by
the United States as a declaration of
war. The Secretary called attention to
a similar question which General Reyes
had propounded on December 8 and his
reply thereto. Continuing, the Secre
tary repeated a portion of his letter of
the 11th, expressing the opinion of the
President concerning civil war in Pan
ama. The Secretary closed with the
statement that he could only reiterate
what he had before said on the subject
of General Reyes' inquiry and added
that the time which had elapsed since
December 11 had only tended to deepen
the painful impression that would be
created in this country by the armed
invasion of Panama territory by Co
lombian troops, and the sense of the
responsibility that would thereby b<Â»
imposed on the Government of the
United States. He said he had been In
structed to inform General Reyes that
this Government had only the friend
liest intentions toward Colombia and
would not lightly be provoked into as
suming a hostile attitude toward that
republic.
Two letters written by Bunau-Varil
la. Minister of Panama, to the Secre
tary of State, are under date of De
cember 31, 1303. The first letter In
forms Secretary Hay that the Govern
ment of Panama desires to receive im
; mediately after the exchange of ratifi
cations of the treaty only J2.0OO.0OO of
the $10,000,000 to be paid by the United
States, leaving the remainder to be
later employed for investment In con
, sistent works which would permanently
represent the counter value of the ex
penses incurred. According: to this
principle, M. Bunau-Varllla Inquires
whether the United States Government
Â¦would pay interest of 3 per cent an
nually on the $8.000.000,. which would bÂ«
left in the United States Treasury. He
suggests the drafting of a special con
vention covering this point if It meets
the approval of the United States Gov
ernment.
The second letter informs Secretary
Hay that M. Bunau-Varllla had re
ceived a telegram from his Government
declaring that Panama, as soon as its
independence was recognized by Co
lombia, intended to assume a part of
Colombia's exterior debt, of which ths
principal was settled at Â£3.000,000 by
special convention, and which is. now
accrued by unpaid Interest. Panama
expressed readiness to assume a pro
portion of the debt equal to the Â¦ pro
portion of the population of Panama to
Colombia, about one to fifteen.
In Tietr or these facts I am Instructed ti
say to rour Excellency that the Government
of the United States would regard with th*
gravest concfrn any Invasion of the territory
of Panama by Colombian troops, for the reason
that bloodshed and disorder would inevitably
rÂ»*ult throughout the whole extent of thw
isthmus and for the further reason that. In
the opin!on . of the President, fie lime has
come. In the interest of universal cemmere
and civilization, to close the chapter of san
guinary and nincu^ clv!l war in Faaama.
In answer to this. Secretary Hay
wrote General Reyes under date of De
cember 11, saying, after quoting the
question asked:
I have quoted your question textuaily .and
In. reference to it am Instructed by thÂ« Fr*Â§J
dent to bring to the attention o* yjur Ex
cellency the following facts:
- That the republic of PanansA snx : Â»imrt its)

in consequence of this movement, tha inde

this Government and by many others; that a
treaty has been signed between the Unit*d
States and Panama. wh!ch has been ratified
by- the latter State, and is now awaiting rati
fication by the American Senate: that by-thÂ»
provisions of said treaty the United Stales
agrees to maintain tbe Independence of Pan
ama: that, although the treaty has not yet

t have the honor to address to your'Ex

that I have received from my Government in
structions to Inquire what attitude would b*
assumed by thÂ» Government of thÂ« Units*
States In the event, which/may take j)!a<"Â».

changed between General Reyes and
the Secretary of State concerning the
attitude of the United States In .case
Colombian troops should be sent to Pan*
ama; also copies of tno notes to th*
State Department by the Minister of
Panama to the United States.
The communication â¢ of General
Reyes is addressed to Secretary â¢ Hay
and dated December S, at Washington,
and reads: :
The treaty, instead of requiring a. cession of
Colombia'* so\ ereignty ov<r the canal strip, ex
prcwly acknowledged, confirmed and preserved
hÂ»r sovereignty over It. ThÂ» treaty In this
vrprct eimpiy proceeded on th^ lines on which
nil neg&trations Jeading up to the present eitu
atl'-n have been conducted. â¢ â¢ â¢
During the years of negotiation and discus-
Nor i* the fact to bÂ» lost sight of that the
rejected treaty, while, generously. responding to
:he pecuniary demarÂ»ds of Colombia, In other
respects merely provided frr the. construction
of the canal In conformity with the express re
Â«^uiiÂ»nients of the act cf the Congress on June
2*. iaO2-
The President says that when this
Government submitted to Colombia
th<* Hay-Herran treaty three things
rat therefore already settled. One
Â»as that the canal should be built.
The second, that it should be "our
purpose to deal not merely in a spirit
or Justice, but in a spirit of generoslty
v ith the people through whose land
*re might build it. The Hay-Herran
treaty." says the President, "if it
rrred at all. erred in. the direction of
over-generosity toward the Colombian
Oovernment. In our anxiety to be fair
we had gone, to the very verge in
yielding: to a weak nation's demands
what that nation was helplessly un
able to enforce from us against our
â¢will. The only criticism made upon
the administration for the terms of
th*; Hay-Herran treaty was for having
granted too much to Colombia, not
for failure to grant enough. Neither
in the Congress nor in the public
j'TCES, at the time this treaty was for
mulated, was, there complaint that it
did not in the fullest and amplest
mannrr guarantee to Colombia every
thing that she could by any color of
title demand."
Continuing, the President says: .
â¢ ' ntrcl. police and protect the rar.al whicii
â¢ ii to be built, keepinar it Â«n>rn tor the ves
Â»â¢!Â« of aUl nations on Â»"ju*l terms. The Unltefl

r. bM. Th* c-aranty included, as a matter
.,f i.ourÂ»e. .the building r-l tnÂ» cacal. The
er.terrri** was recognized as responding to
an international need: and -it would be the
vÂ»rieÂ»t travesty en tight an2 justice to treat

OF THE COLOMBIANS
t* secure a treaty for th!s purpose with one
cf the Central American republic* did not
*tsnd on the Faire footing with the effort
t* â¢â¢â¢cure a treaty under ordinary conditions.
Th<* President then quotes, as he did
in his annual message, what he terms
Uke proper position of the United States
to assume in reference to this canal,
and therefore to the Governments of
the isthmus as set forth by Secretary
Caes in 155S. He says the United States
has taken the position that no other
(Jiverrments are to build the canal,
and cites the action of the Senate in
l c ?3 in passing a resolution declaring
that the Government of the United
States will look with serious concern
and disapproval upon any connection
<'f any European Government rrith the
construction or control of any ship
canal across the isthmes of Darien or
across Central America. He cays:

Â¦WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â President
Roosevelt to-day transmitted his mes
sage to Congress. It '.j a document of
prrat length and deals almost exclu
sively with Panama and the isthmian
canal.
The President says that he lays be
fore Congress a statement of his action
up to the present time on the act ap
proved June 28, 1502, by which the
President was authorized to secure
"for the United States the property of
the Panama Canal Company and the
perpetual control of a strip six miles
wid? across the isthmus of Panama."
It was further provided that "should
the President be unable to obtain for
the United States a satisfactory title
to the property of the new Panama
Canal Company and the control of the
necessary territory of the republic of
Penama within a reasonable time and
upon reasonable terms, then the Presi
dent should endeavor to provide for a
<-anal by the Nicaraguan route." The
President continues:
The lar4T-age quoted defines with exactness
s^.d pre<is!cn what was to bÂ» done and what
a* a matter of fact has been done. The Presi
dent wa.Â« authorized to mo to the Nicaragua.
r"Jte only if within a. reasonable time he
ci-ulj cot obtain â¢'control ot the necessary
tÂ«"-ritory of the republic o? Colombia." This
contrc! has now been obtained; the irtrvislon
at the aft has been complied with; it is no
!<-rjrÂ»r possible under existing circumstances
to go to the Nicaragua route as an alternative.
Th'.a art marked the climax of the effort*
on the part of the United States to secure,
rn far as legislation was concerned, an lnter
r.reajiic canal across the isthmus. The effort
President : Ropsevelt transmits with
his messages copies of the latest notes
from the Minister of the republic of
Panama to this Government, and of
certain- notes .which have passed be
tween the special. envoy of the republic
of Colombia and of this Government.
In conclusion. let mÂ»' repeat that the ques
tion actually '. before this Government Is net
that-of the recognition of Panama as aa Inde
pendent republic. That is al-eady an accom
plished fact. The question and tha only ques
tion is whether we shall or not build an isth
mian canal. Â¦ ... \ -
It is en all hands conceded that treaties re
lating to boundaries and rights of navigation
continue- 5n force without regard to changes In
government or sovereignty. This principle ob
viously applies to .that part of the treaty of
1S46 which relates to the Isthmus of Panama
By our prompt action not only hare cur in
terosl.3 Â»i'i' tho*Â» of. the world at large been
conserved, but wÂ»'have forestalled complica
tions which were, likely- to be fruitful in loss to
ourselves and in bloodshed and suffering to the
people of tho istl rr.ur. |
Instead of using our fcrces aÂ« we were in
vited by Co!o.TÂ»lnc to do. fr.r the two-fold pur
pose ot defeating cur own rights and interests
and the interests of the civilized world, and of
compelling the submission of the people cf the
isthmus to . those ~ whom they regarded as op
pressors, we shall. In duty bound, keep tue
transit open and prevent its invasion. Mean
while, the enly question now before us Is that
of the ratification of th; treaty. For it is to
be ' remembered that a failure to ratify the
treaty will not urdo what has been done: wi!l
not restore Panama to Colombia and will not
alter our obligations to keep thÂ« transit open
across the isthmus, and to prevent any outside
power from menacing this transit.
It seems to hare been assumed in certain
quarters that th* proposition that the obliga
tions of article 35 of the treaty of 1S4S are to
be considered as adhering to and following
the sovereignty of the Isthmus so long as that
sovereignty Is not absorbed b7 the United
States, rests upen same novel theory. No as
sumption, could be made further from the fact.
It is by no means" true that a state In declar
ing Its independence rids !tse!f of all treaty
obligations entered icto by the parent govern
ment. Â«â¢-â¢ ?*â¢*>â¢ â¢
So will It b* with Panama. The people cf
the Isthmus, and as I nnr.lv believe of the ad
jacent parts of Central and South America,
will be greatly benefited by the building of
tbe canal and the guarantee o* peace ana or
der along Its' line: and band in hand with the
benefit to them will go the benefit to us and
to mankind.
. Tlie President refers to the aid given
Cubans in establishing them upon a
career of self-government and inde
pendence, and adds:
In view of the manifold considerations of
treaty rights and obligations, ot national in
terest and safety and of* collective civilization,
by which our Government was constrained to
act, I am at a loss to comprehend the attitude
of those who can discern In the recognition of.
tbe republic of Panama only a general ap
proval cf the principles of "revolution," by
which tbe given Government Is overturned or
one portion 1 of a country separated from an
rant a revolutionary movement cf either kind.
But there Is no fixed rule whicii caa be applied
to all such movement" 1 . Each cale must be
judged on its own merits. But in my opinion
no disinterested and fair-minded observer ac
quainted with the circumstances can fail la
feel that Panama had the amplest justification
for seDaratlon from Colombia under the con
ditions existing, and, moreover. tha.t its action
was in tbe highest degree beneficial to the
Interests of the civillred world by securing the
immediate opportunity for the building of the
interoceanic canal. It would be well for those
who are pessimistic as to our action in peace
fully recognizing the republic of Panama.
while we lawfully protected the transit from
invasion and disturbance, to recall what has
been done In Cuba, 'where we Intervened Â«ven
by force on general grounds of national Inter
est and duty. When we Interfered It was
.freely prophesied that we intended to keep
Cuba and administer it for our own Interests.
Results have demonstrated in a angularly con
clusive fashion the falsity of th 1 * prophecy.
Cuba is now an independent republic.
Little could it have b*en foreseen that two
years later- the Colombian Government. le<l
astray by false allurements of selfish advan
tage, and forgetful alike of its International
obligations and of the duties and responsibili
ties of society, wcuid thwart the efforts cf the
United States to enter upon and complete a
work which the nations or America, re-echoins
the sentiment of the nations of Europe, bad
pronounced to be not only worthy of . the
rreatness of the American people, but also
"in the highest sense a work of civilization.*'
That our position as to the mandatory of
civilization, has by no means been miscon
ceived IÂ» shown by the promptltuds with which
tht powers have, one after another, followed
our lead In recognizing Panama as an Inde
pendent state.
PANAMA'S ACTION
ENTIRELY PROPER,
' PRESIDENT ASSERTS
President Roosevelt speaks of the
resolution adopted by the Pan-Amer
ican Conference at the city of Mexico
on. January. 22, 1902, applauding, the
purpose^ of the United States to con
struct an interoceanic canal, and calls
attention to . the fact that General
Reyes, the present delegate of Colom
bia in "Washington, was among those
who signed the resolution. He con
tinues: * Â¦
and declarations. In order that no obstacle
micht stand in our way Great Britain re
nounces Important . rights under tile Claytort-
Bulwer treaty And agreed to its abrogation.
recelvinr in return nothing but our honorable
pledce to build the canal and protect it Â»s
an open highway.
The President relates the delay of
the Colombian Congress in taking ac
tion on the treaty and the breaking' out
of the revolution three days after that
body ended its session in October with
out passing upon the document. "Pan
ama," he says, "became an independent
state, and the control of the territory
necessary for building the canal then
became obtainable. The condition un
der which alone we could have gone to
Nicaragua thereby became impossible
of fulfillment. If the impending treaty
Â¦with Panama should not be ratified by
the Senate this would not alter the fact
that we could not go to Nicaragua.
The Congress has decided the route,
and there is no alternative under exist
ing legislation."
The President says that Secretary
Hay had repeatedly warned Colombia ,
that grave consequences might follow
from her rejection of the treaty, and al
though the administration had special
means of knowledge, no such means
were necessary in order to appreciate
the possibility of a revolutionary out
break. "Quotations from the daily pe
pers," says he, "could be indefinitely
multiplied to show this state of af
fairs," and the President quotes dis
patches sent by special correspondents
to Washington and New Tork papers
under dates extending over a period,
from August 31 to October 26 telling of
the stirred condition of affairs.
The President had also on October 45,
at the request of Lieutenant General
Young, seen Captain H. B. Humphrey
and Lieutenant Grayson Mallet-Provost
Murphy, who' had just returned from a
four months' tour through portions of
Venezuela and Colombia. They had in
formed him that it was the general be
lief that thfÂ» revolution might break out
any moment. "In view of all these
facts." says the President, "I directed
the Navy Department to issue instruc
tions such as would insure your having
ships within easy reach of the isthmus
in the event of need arising." â¢
On November 2, when It was evident
that the outbreak was Imminent, in
structions had been sent to the com
manders of the Boston, Nashville and
Dixie to "maintain free and uninter
rupted transit. If interruption is threat
ened by armed force occupy the line of
railroad. Prevent landing of any
armed force with hostile intent, either
government or insurgent, as any point
within fifty miles ot Panama."
On November 3 Commander John
Hubbard of the Nashville had reported
to the Navy Department that 400 Co
lombian troops from Cartagena had
landed in Colon and that the situation
was most critical. The President then
quotes from Commander Hubbard's re
port on November 5 to the Navy De
partment, in which the commander said
the occurrences of November 3 had
"amounted to practically the making
of war against the United States by
the officers in command of the Colom
bian troops in Colon." The United
States Consul had received notice from
Colonel Torres to the effect that if the
Colombian officers. Generals Tobal and
Finally the Congress definitely settled where
the canal was to be built. It was provided that
a treaty should be made for buildinic the canal
across the isthmus of Panama: and if. after
reasonable time, it proved impossible to secure
such treaty, that then we should go to Nlcara
rui. The treaty has been made: for It reeds no
argument to nhow that the Intent of the Con
gress was to Insure a canal across Panama.
NICARAGUA ROUTE
CANNOT BE GIVEN
ANY CONSIDERATION
That the canal itself was eagerly demanded
by the pecple of the locality through which it
waÂ« to pass, and that the people of this Jo
cality no !eÂ« eacerly longed rcr its construc
tion under American control, are shown by th*
unanimity of tfcÂ« action in the new Panama
republic. Furthermore. Colombia, after having
rejected the treaty in spite of our protests and
warnings when It was in her power to accept
it. has since shown thÂ» utmost eagerness to
accept the eaine treaty if only the status quo
cou!d be restored. OnÂ« of thÂ« men standing
highest in the official circles of Colombia, on
November 6. addressed .the American Minister
at Bcgota, saying that if the Government of the
United States would land troops to preserve
Colombian sovereignty end the transit, the Co
lombian Government would declare martiai
law; and, by virtue of vested constitutlona!
authority, when public order is disturbed
f would) approve by decree the ratification of th
canÂ»l treaty as slsried; or. If the Government
of the United States prefers (would) call an
extra session cf the Conrressâ with new ana
friendly membersâ next May to approve the
treaty. â¢ â¢ â¢
Â»icn that preceded the conclusion of the Hay-
Herran treaty. Cclombia never Intimated that
the requirements by the United States of con
trol over the canal strip would render unattain
able the construction of a canal by way of tha
Isthmus of Panama; ncr were we sd.isfd, dwr
lr.jr tbe months when legislation ot 1JÂ»O2 **â¢
pending before the Congress, that the term*
which it embodied would reader negotiations
with Colombia impracticable. It is p'.aln that
neutrality of the canal with a leis degree of
control than was stipulated for In the Hay-
Herran treaty. A refu?ai to grant such degree
cf control mi necessarily a refusal to make
any practical treaty at all.
** T COXFIDEXTLY maintain that the recognition of the republic of Panama was an act
justified by the interests of collective civilization. If ever a Government could be said to
hare received a mandate from cir'ilisation to effect an object the accomplishment of zvhieh icas
demanded in the interests of mankind, the United States holds that petition with regard to the
:;i!er oceanic canal. Since our purpose to build the canal zi'as definitely announced there have
tv;:;r from all quarters assurances of approval and encouragement. In conclusion, let me repeat
'.hat the question actually before this Government is not that of the recognition of Panama as an
independent republic. That is already an accomplished fact. The question and the only question
is whether tie shall or shall not build an isthmian canal." â Extract From the Presi

The act that went into effect to-day
gives the Hawaiian Islands a system of
county government for the first time.
Up to now all the affairs of the islands
have been under the control of the Ter
ritorial government, having headquar
ters in Honolulu. In all the political
campaigns since annexation, and espe
cially among, the natives, there haa
been a strong demand for more local
self-government. ...
CALIENTES, Nev., Jan. 4. -Word
comes from Moapa that the Indians in
the Arrow Canyon range near the reseiv
vatlon held a scalp dance four days
ago and that the settlers are much
alarmed in consequence. It Is thought
that the Indians who took part in the
dance are Piutes. but this is not cer
tain. Frank Rodgers and H. B. Mc-
Intyre were -coming out of the' "Arrow
Canyon range country. and were travel
ing at night. Attracted by a gigantic
campflre, tbey came within sight of the
dance ground of the Indians. The white
men did not dare venture very close,
but went near enough to see that the
Indians were In full war regalia and
were evidently working themselves up
to a high pitch of excitement. There
were about 100 or. more redskins In the
party. Rodgers and Mclntyre say that
the most bloodcurdling yells and groans
came from the camp. They watched
the dance from a distance for an hour
and then continued on their way, warn
ing settlers whom they .encountered.
Some of the latter packed up and, tak
ing what stock they could, left. A
small party of. friendly. Indians who
camped fortv miles from the. scene of
the reported scalp dance told a. rancher
named Roberts 1 , that 'the Piutes were
greatly excited at' the news that one
of the!r tribe is to be hanged for mur
der shortly and that the hostile/dem
onstrations of the last few days were
intended as warning* to the whites of
what will occur If the condemned Piute
is executed. Some of the ranchers pro
fess to bellevethat the "scare has been
overestimated and that the Indians will
do no serious'damage.' "- â¢"â¢Â¦ '

HONOLULU. Jan. 4.â The county
government' act went into effect to-day.
A. Hocking has been elected chairman.
The bureaus transferred from the direct
control of - the Territorial- authorities
will be generally maintained unchanged
temporarily, as the constitutionality of
the act is much questioned^ The Su
preme Court has under consideration a
test case made by special arrangement
and involving the entire law. In the
event of the act being. declared. Illegal
grave confusion may ensue and an ex
tra session of the Legislature .may be
necessary, as the Territorial appropria
tions ceased with the end of last year,
the Legislature having contemplated
county government after January.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 4. â Antone

eral weeks ago Morallis made an as
sault upon a man named Seamens,
with the intent of commiting robbery.
After, assaulting Seamens he made his
escape", and was a.\ large for several
days. He was convicted by a jury,
and, owing to his bad record and hav

was given the full penalty as provided
for by law. . . ,

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4. â Another
widow has appeared as claimant to
the now famous Hill fortune in the
person of Mrs. Maggie E. Hill of St.
Louis. John I. Martin, sergeant at
arms of the Democratic National
Committee and attorney for the Mis
souri Pacific Railway at St. Louis, is
in' Los Angeles preparing to present
the claims of this latest heir to the
old .miser's wealth.- Attorney Martin
says that his client was married to
Charles Hill in 1892 In St. Louis; that
one child was born to them, after
which Hill disappeared and was not
heard of again until hisdeath in Los
Angeles was noted!- The fortune In

The .opinion closed with directing the
discharge of the woman. Commissioner
Deget&u- was much pleased with the
decision and said he considered it a
stepping stone to a more pronounced
recognition of the, rights of Porto Ri
cans in the United States.
''\Y> are not required to discuss the
power of Congress In the premises or
the contention of Gonzales' counsel
that the cession of Porto Rico accom
plished the naturalization of the people
or that of Commissioner Degetau that
a citizen of Porto Rico'is necessarily a
citizen of -the United States. The ques
tion is the narrow one whether Gon
zales was alien within the meaning of
that term as used, in the act, of 1891?
We think it clear that that act relates
to foreigners as respects this country,
to persons owing allegiance to foreign
governments and citizen's -or subjects
thereof,, and citizens of Porto Hico,
whose permanent allegiance is to the
United States are not aliens; and upon
their arrival by water at the ports of
our mainland are riot alien immigrants
within the intent and meaning of the
act of 1891."

It says the.qarstiort.was rather that of
alienage, , and added: Â¦-Â¦'' , =.- :
The court did not agree with the coun

In his opinion the Chief Justice, re
ferring to the act of 1900, creating a
civil .government for Porto Rico, said
that the woman was a citizen of Porto
Rico under that act, and added that
"there ' was nothing expressed in the
act, nor reasonably to be implied there
from, to indicate the intention of Con
grtss that citizens of Porto Rico should
be considered as aliens and the right
of free access denied to them."
WASHINGTON. Jan. 4.â In an opin
ion by Chief Justice. \FulIer, the Su
preme Court of the uKited' States de
cided that citizens of Porto Kico are
not aliens of the United States and that
they are entitled to enter this country
without obstruction. The opinion was
delivered in the case of a Porto Rican
woman, Gonzales, who, in 1902, was re
fused admission to the port of New
York on the ground that she was like
ly to become a public charge. The de
cision was based entirely on the immi
gration act of 1891; and took the ground
that the Porto Ricans owe allegiance 'to
the United States and to no other gov
ernment.

the Coroner's investigation Into the
tragedy near Bannes, in which a
woman lost her life and her husband
was frightfully burned by the burning
of a house which they occupied, is a
verdict that the death was accidental.
It was learned that the man's name
is Clinton M. Osborn of Boston, and
that he is a user of morphine. The
woman's body was burned to a crisp.

HOXOLULU, Dec. 28.â Hawaii's ex
hibit for the St. Louis fair has .many,
unique features, which the mainland
schools will necessarily be without, and
doubtless the exhibit from here will atj
tract much attention on that account.
In the courses in manual training the
children make hats, fans, pillows, etc.,
from lauhala, and the handiwork of
some of the little tots of 7 or 8 years is
a surprise.- The. making of native hats
and fans will be well shown in a series
of fans in various- stages' of completion,
from the raw product to the 'finished
work, making it possible to see Just
how the intricate twisting is done.
There are also many samples of sew
ing, this being one of the accomplish
ments taught In, the schools here.' Some
excellent samples of lace made in the
schools have also been gathered togeth
er. Photographs of the youngsters in
their classes, aJl busy with the needle,
or of the school press room, where the
art of printing Is taught, and other sim
ilar features of the exhibit will give a
good , Idea how far Hawaii haa pro
gressed In the development of a modern
school system. There are study charts
made -by the children themselves, fish
nets made in school, baskets, fancy pil-
Iqws and all sorts of artistic articles
peculiar to the Territory in the, collec
tion. Another admirable collection is
that of over 100 pieces of Hawaiian
woods, all cut out and polished by
school children. The exhibit shows Ha
waii's surprising variety of woods,
which are. capable of taking a high
polish and are of fine color.- â¢â¢
Special Correspondence of The Call.
Admiral Terry was reported somt
weeks ago as having said that Pear
Harbor was not what the navy wanted
but he declined to .be. interviewed or
the subject. -
â¢HONOLULU, Dec. 28.â "Pearl Harbor
in its present condition is of no value
for a nava! station," says Rear Ad
miral Robley D. Evans. "Until the
approaches to the lochs, are straight
ened out no battleship or cruiser of the
size now in port can enter' the harbor.
It will cost millions of dollars to make
the lochs available."
Admiral Evans visited Pearl Harbor
with a party of officers and townpeople
on thelroquols. Prior to that time he
was of the opinion that there would be
no difficulty in. making use of Pearl
Harbor, but his visit to the place has
changed this opinion. .
''As far as the/approaches to .the
lochs are concerned," the admiral said,
"it is not available to the battleships
and will not be until the. Government
spends a good many millions of dollars
in straightening it out.' It is so crooked
now that it would not be practicable
to take, in even the cruisers, that are
noxr in port. They are too long, and
could not turn in there. It might be
possible to take the cruisers in with the
assistance of tugs, but even that ia
doubtful. . . ,.
"In its present. condition Pearl Har
bor is,Â©/ no value as a naval station
and it would hardly be worth while tc
build machine shops or docks there at
this time. The first thing to be done
is to make the channel - available. I
don't know what the plans of the de
partment are in the matter."

The third light, giving a neutral day
light effect in the foreground, struggles
in through a half-open doorway.
The technical treatment of these vari
ous lights and shadows is marvelous,
the artist having succeeded, in maintain
ing throughout the picture a soft and
pleasing tone. There is not a trace of
the reigning impressionism. So true is
the sunlight effect in the rear window
that it is difficult to believe at ttrst
blush that there is not an artificial light
in the rear. As the beholder studies the
canvas new and unexpected effects are
discovered. The sparks from the forge
seem 'to .fly- out of the picture and the
figure grows startlfngly near.

tion for a short time in the art rooms of

As. its name indicates, the picture is
that of a worker at the forge. He stands,
middle aged, robust {ind compact in form,
his sleeves rolled back, one hand on the
belfows rope and the other holding the
pincers. His figure, lighted in front by
the intense light from the forge, is re
vealed in bold relief against the darkest
background in the picture.
Besides the light from the forge there
is a second light in the back of the
smithy from the window, through which
bright sunlight streams, creating sec
ondary shadows.

Bank Gets New Trial.
The Supreme Court yesterday re- |
versed a decision in favor of a repre-|
sentative of the W. P. Fuller Company !
against the Crocker- Wool worth. Bank, j
A. B. Perry, formerly a member of the .
Fuller Company, opened an account !
with the Tallant National Bank, repre
senting that he had no partners in
business. The Tallant National Bank
subsequently transferred Perry's ac
count to the Crocker- Woolworth Bank.
When Perry was about to die $1600 j
was drawn by hi3 representatives. The
W. P. Fuller Company contends that
the money belonged to the firm. The j
Crocker- Woolworth Bank thinks other- j
wise. The case must now be retried.
It w.is because of the testimony of
F. L. Turp'n, r/ho recently sued Perry
because of the trouble between the di
rectors of the bank, that Perry's estate
became a bone of contention. At the
first hearing of the petition yesterday
morning he testified thai Perry owned
a large block of stock in the bank and
that there was danger of its being mis
used. That he was mistaken was
shown by the testimony taken at the
afternoon session, when it was shown
that the holdings were small.
The 564,000 estate of the late
Charles O. Perry, secretary of the Co
lumbian Banking Company, was the
subject of quite a lively discussion in
Judge Murasky's court yesterday. The
discussion was brought about by the
petition of the Public Administrator to
be appointed special administrator^- of
the estate. It was claimed that be
cause of the recent row. between the
directors of the banking concern it
was unsafe to allow Perry's effects to
remain uncared for. The court set
tled the dispute by granting the Ad
ministrator's petition, -with the under
standing that all the securities of the
banker be turned over to the clerk of
the court anJ that the Public Adminis
trator retain possession only of the
furniture of the deceased, stored in his
late home at Belvedere."

The resolution directing the Treas

chines to various persons, aggregating
the sum of $4550, was rereferred to the
Joint committee on Finance, Police and i
Licenses. The expert of the Finance
Committee reported that the claims ag
gregated more than the amount of
licenses handed In.
The demand of C. B. Holbrook for
$325 was rejected by the Finance Com
mittee, he not having assisted In the
prosecution of certain offenders found
guilty of cruelty to animals. The de- j
mand of former Auditor Wells for $7

BUYS LOT OF LAND.
An authorization was ordered drawn
in favor of Annie Chapman for $7250, In

The board adopted a rule that the
clerk shall keep a record of all requests

of Supervisors to any officer or board
of the city and county, and the action |
thereon of such officer or board.
The following ordinances were finally
passed:

The proposed ordinance prohibiting
the operation of machines or engines on
public streets and sfdevyalks, and de
signed to suppress compressed air house
and carpet cleaning machines was in
definitely postponed without any ob
jection being made. City Attorney Lane
advised that a provision exempting ma
chines used on city work from restric
tion invalidated the measure.
Watt said that the former practice
of the Fire Commission that a number
of horse dealers throughout the country
be asked for bids to purchase horses
had been abandoned by the present ad
ministration. Braunhart suggested the
adoption of a resolution requesting the
Fire Commission to "follow the former
plan in the purchase of horses. * '
Fire Commissioner Maestrettl an
nounced rather defiantly that so far as
he was concerned he would follow the
charter and would not agree to send a
man out in the country to get bids, for
horses, even If it were to the city's best
interests to do so. This declaration was
characterized as remarkable by Bran
denstein.
The Finance and Fire Committees
were directed to confer with the F*ire
Commission to ascertain if the old plan
could not be readopted.
MACHINES MAY OPERATE.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
resumed its investigation into the ex
cessive prices paid for "horses by the
Fire Department to J. J. Doyle, and
after a long discussion the latter's bills
for nineteen horses, aggregating $5475,
were ordered paid.
Evidence was presented that pro
posals for furnishing ten horses, more
or less, had been Invited by resolution
of the Fire Commissioners on August 7,
1903. The award of contract for ten
horses for $2000 was made to J. J. Doyle
on August 23.
Proposals were again invited on Sep
tember IS for twenty-flve horses, and
September 19 the contract for ten horses
was awarded to Doyle for $275 each.
Fire Commissioner Watt thought the
price charged was outrageously high.
He produced a letter from a man in
Petaluma, who offered to sell good
horses for $200 or $250.
Copies ot the memorial were ordered
sent to the President and each member
of Congress and the Senate.
Therefore, this board memorializes the Pres!
<Jem and the Ccngrer* of the United States to
paf.Â« such law* as may be necessary to grant
to the city and county of San Francisco the
rirht to use the reservoir sites heretofore
applied for.
Whereas. Neither of the two sites In ques

Wherecs. The use to which the w-ater Is to
If put Is the hisrhest possible beneficial use.
Whereas, It is not conceivable that th#
maintenance of a forest reservation with an
area of about ir.Hi square miles is to inter
fere to any material extent with the develop
ment of water for useful purposes, particu
larly when such utilization introduces into
the ;>nrk a ne* lake about two miles in arÂ»a
and enlarges a second from less than one-half
to nearly two square miles, enhancing the
natural beauties of the park instead of de
tractin- from them.
INTRODUCES XEW-XiAIvE.
"Tt'ere may be a difference of. opinion as
to what natural objects may be justly con
sidered as being" within the meaning of this
prv% ision of the law, but there car. be no
doubt about the duty of the Secretaiy of the
Interior If, in h!g judgment, they are such
natural curiosities or natural wonder: as con
templated by the act.'"
Â¦\Yhereas, Both of these sites have been
recognized by the Department of the Interior
aÂ« desirable and available for the atorage of
the flood-flow of the mountain streams, as
demonstrated by the reports of the United
States geological survey in which these reser
voir sites are repeatedly referred ;o. A plat
of the survey of Hetch Hetchy Valley was *ub
n-ltted to the Secretary of the Interior by the
United States geological survey and Its reser
vation from entry or settlement according to
law was asked for under date of February
27. 1881. <See opening statement ami page 35
of part 11 of the twelfth annual report of<the
United States geological survey.) A further
report upon the availability of this reservoir
site, with a study of the works r.ectssary at
the dam site, are contained In the twenty
first annual report of the United States geo
logical survey, pages <3O to ' 4CT>. in which,
on page 459, it Is stated "another purpose
which this dam and reservoir miclit be mode
to rer-.e would be to furnish the city of San
Francibco with an unfailing supply of pure
water. Without entering Into details it will
suffice to eay that the dam and reservoir as
proposed would insure a supply in the driest
years of 230 gallons per diem per capita for
l.um.OOQ people."
Lake Eleanor and the segregation of its
lands for reaervo:r purposes Is referred to In
part 11 of the eleventh annual repoit of the
United States geological survey^- page 157. onj
the plate between pages 100 and 101, and on
page 167; also In the thirteenth annual report,
part 111. pace <02. .-..
"It is contended that the appropriation of
Lake Eleanor and Hetch Hetchy Valley for
great reservoirs for the proposed storage of
water would tnhanee rather than detiact from
their natural beauty, but this Is not material
in view of the law which cummand^ the Sec
retary of the Interior to preserve and retain
them in their natural condition if they are
'natural curiosities."
WOULD ENHANCE BEAUTY".
; Whereas, The specific reason of the rejec
tion of these' applications Is in part titeted by
the honorable Secretary of the Interior at fol
lows: "The act of October 1. 1890. mikes It
obligatory upon the Fecretary of the Interior
to preserve and retain the 'natural curiosities
and wonders' In the park in their 'natural
condition." This provision of the act which
j established the park remains in lull force,
not having been repealed or modified by the
I act under which this application is made nor
I by any other legislation.
I Thk Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a memorial to Congress and
the President of the United States ask
ing for the necessary legislation to
grant the rights of tray in Hetch
; Hetchy Valley and Lake Eleanor, ap-
I plication for which has been denied by
j the Secretary, of the Interior. The
! Board of Works prepared the memo
rial on the ground that the necessity
I of securing an abundant supply of pure
| water from the Sierras is manifest. The
j memorial folli/ws:
| Whereas. Tht application* for reservoir
riirhtf-or-way wore denied by the Secretary' of
I the Interior, who points out that, ob viewed
; by the D^r'-irtmem of the Interior, "the ap-
I vMratlon Is confronted by legal rmbarraÂ«s
{ Vents which appear to If surmountable only
j by the exercise of the legislative potier of the
Government."
The ordinance authorizing the Board t
of Election Commissioners to appoint a
storekeeper-mechanic for the Depart
ment of Elections was finally passed.
The ordinance is designed to legalize
the tenure of Fred Anderson, who has
filled the position for four years past, j
The board referred to the Light Com- j
mittee the proposed ordinance regu
lating the installation of gasfitting in
accordance with an act of the Legisla

Board of WorKs shall appoint a num

Is It Transmutation*
In the last few months' something
little short of confusion, has been
wrought in the ranks of science by the
revelations of the metal radium. The
atomic thoory, long established, was
upset; the principle of conservation of
energy, which seemed impregnable, was
threatened, and a general insecurity in
scientific beliefs began to be felt. But
a great hope alsu arose, the hope that
humanity was on the verge of some
marvelous discovery of tne true' con
stitution of things and perhaps of the
meaning of life and nature. That hope
has *not yet been fulfilled, and it is
gradually subsiding again. But radium
reserved at least one other surprise for
the scientists... Sir William Ramsay,
professor of chemistry at University
College, Ixindon.^ has made the discov
ery that this mysterious element has
the power of changing by some subtle
process into another element, namely,
helium. He found that, besides its oth
er manifestations, radium constantly
gives off an emanation which seems
to behave in all respects like a heavy
gas. It can fre collected in flasks, mea
sured, weighed, but in about a month
It entirely disappears. What becomes
of it? By the aid of the spectroscope.
Sir "William Ramsay found that It
changes into helium. Thus, it is claim
ed, one element has been detected in
the very process of transformation into
another.â Harper's Weekly.

THE new year begins with shadows falling over
many parts of the world, forecasting the approach
of war. Macedonia and Manchuria are storm cen
ters. A possible contest on the isthmus between our
selves and Colombia would -hardly- bV more than an
opera bouffe affair in itself, but it would none the less
have consequences affecting the world. Trivial there
fore as it may seem, it takes its place in the domain of
world politics and must- be considered along with the
larger contests that appear to be impending in the Le
vant and in the Orient.
In times gone by the course of world politics was de
termined mainly by the ambitions of contending dynas
ties. Macaulay in a striking passage tells how the desire
of Frederick the Great to annex Silesia caused rival
Moguls to go to war against one another in the valley
of the Ganges and the red men to scalp one another on
the banks of Lake Huron, . The statement is not an ex
aggeration, for the ambitions of Frederick involved
Great Britain and France in his wars, and they in turn
set their armies and fleets to stirring up their allies to
battle in India and in America. Thus the schemes of
a military adventurer who happened to be born to a
throne sufficed to set three continents aflame with war.
About the only direct results' of those old wars were
the extensions of the bounds of empire and the increase
of the military power of this or that nation. Widely dif
ferent is Jhe nature of the world p'olitics . of our time.
No dynastic ambition' is concerned- in the impending
struggles in Macedonia or in Manchuria any more than
in Panama. The quiet and melancholy man who sits
upon the Russian throne and is known as Autocrat is
doubtless as desirous of peace as any other man living,
and so far from seeking an increase of power would
probably be glad to dispense with much -that is now
weighing upon him. A new force is driving the nations
forward. ' Russian advance into Manchuria is done in
the name of the commerce and the industries of civiliza
tion, even as is our advance toward supremacy in Pan
ama. Â¦ ,
Of course Russia cannot carry to any part of the
world the civilization that- prevails in Western Europe
and in the United. States, and to that extent
her aggressive movements upon Turkey,^ China and Per
sia are looked upon as portentous of danger, to civiliza
tion 1 itself. Were it otherwise, the impending conflicts
in Macedonia and in Manchuria would be frankly count
ed as parts of that general movement of conquest on v the
part of civilization over the barbarian or semi-civilized
races of the- earth that is so notable a feature of our
time.

The worthy ladies and gentlemen who .honored the

pains to counsel their associates against the danger of

Ancnt the Canteen.
Great uneasiness was caused to the
country at large by the recent official
report that, during the last "official
year, 5034 men, the equivalent of six.lull
regiments, had deserted from the
American army. In view of such a fact
it becomes *of vital importance to
search for tfce causes of the discontent
which must be at the root of this evil.
Colonel W. C. Church, editor of the
Army and Navy Journal, in a thought
ful article in the December number of
the North American Review, expresses
the opinion that, in any thorough and
comprehensive investigation, the effect
of the discontinuance of the army can
teen must not be overlooked. The
army canteen was established for the
sake of abolishing the post trader, and
Colonel Church avers that the army
was making excellent progress in tem
perance under the influence of the can
teen, when, in obedience to civilian In
terference, Congress legislated it out of
existence. Colonel Church deplores the
tendency shown by a multitude of peo
ple who know nothing of army condi
tions to impose their theories in prac
tice upon the American soldier. He
quotes the. testimony of a number of
clergymen familiar with army life to
the evil effects of the anti-canteen leg
islation, and in confirmation of his
\iews he appeals to the opinion ex
pressed by the vast majority of the of
ficers of the army; \yho are almost, he
says, a unit in their desire for the re
establishment of the canteen, which
was found to be a highly successful
means of keeping the soldier within the
barracks and away from the tempta
tions which lie in wait for him beyond
its confines.

AMONG the things unexpected that are quite likely
to happen in the near future is the development in
Central Africa of an electrical power plant that
will be the largest in the world, leaving that* at Niagara
Falls as a bad second. The enterprise has been carefully
considered by engineers and is reported to be entirely
feasible, so that the region known to- men of the.present
generation as "Darkest Africa" may possess within a few
years the most stupendous source of -electrical energy
that human enterprise has been able to achieve.
'The proposed plant is to be established at Victoria
Falls, and will be of enormous value to the coun
try, where there is a great lack of coal and suit
able wood for fuel purposes. The region around the
falls is rich in resources of many kinds, but its exploita
tion has been financially impossible because every man
ufactured article used in the 'development of any kind of
industry has to be imported at heavy cost. The opera
tion of electrical power generated by the great falls will
provide means for establishing manufactories in, the coun
try itself and thus promote its exploitation in "every di
rection.
A recent account of the project says: "The electric
plant will be built on a shelf cut into the side near the
bottom of one of the zigzag cracks below the falls. The
water will be carried around the cataract in great steel
tubes and dropped three hundred feet to big turbine
wheels. The engineers of the South African Company
estimate that the falls will furnish 35,000,000 horse
power; Niagara, if every drop of water were used, would
not furnish more than 7,000.000 horsepower. Thirty
five million horsepower means the equivalent of more
than ten horses, working night and day, for every white
person in South Africa. It is enough, one would think, to
manufacture every article that South Africa needs; it is
enough to light the city of New York, run its street cars
and do all its manufacturing."
The projectors believe that the achievement of then
undertaking would hasten the completion of the much
talked of road from the Cape to Cairo and that with such
communication with the outer world there would grow
up around Victoria Falls a city of first-class importance
that would in time become the metropolis of Africa and
one of the great industrial centers of the world. One
sanguine boomer of the project says: "In South Africa,
since the power cannot come to the city, the city will go
to the power. They will bind their New York or their
Pittsburg on the edge of Victoria*Falls. If any one has
ever sighed with the man who fifty years ago could have
bought a square mile of what is now Chicago for a thou
sand dollars let him go to 'South Africa and buy land near
Victoria Falls. In his old age he will be founding uni
versities and public libraries. The stories of Chicago,
Minneapolis and Denver are sure to be repeated and
magnified."
AN AFRICAN ENTERPRISE.
Output of Rolling Stock.
The car and locomotive output for
the year 1903, as indicated by estimates
prepared by the Railroad Gazette,
shows a falling off in the number of
cars built as compared with 1902, and
a considerable Increase in the number
of locomotives turned out. From offi
cial figures received from all but two
car building concerns in the United
States the Gazette estimates the num
ber of cars built in 1903 at 154,803. These
figures include all freight and passen
ger cars built for elevated and steam
railroads, and are exclusive of those
built by railroads In their own shops
and those built for street and other
electric service.
Of this number approximately 132,081
were freight cars and 2007 passenger
coaches; 153,195 for domestic use and
1613 for export. Last year the total
number of cars built was 164,547, which
is about 9700 in excess of thi3 year. The
decrease has occurred in the last two
months, as uo to that time the output
for 1903 was equal to the output for the
first ten months of 1902.
The cumber of locomotives turned
out from the various engine works of
the country is given at 5152. as com
pared with 4070 in 1902. Included in this
number are SS electric locomotives. The
increase over 1802 is the largest that
has ever occurred in one year, and is,
possibly, due to the fact that the loco
motive works in the country had such
a volume of orders placed during 1902
that they were unable to make imme
diate deliveries, and many of the orders
were held ever until 1903. Returns from
Canada show that 55 locomotives have
been built by two firms, one of which
has only recently begun operations.
At an average cost of $12,000 per loco
motive, the total amount expended by
the railroads in 1903 for motive power
was approximately $62,000,000. This, of
course, is independent of the amount
expended for engines built by the rail
roads at their own shops.

OUR friend of the Colusa Sun seems unable to get
out of* the Panama canal. In a recent issue he
says: "It was said without contradiction that
the Panama' Company paid to somebody ten millions, of
dollars for getting the route adopted N by the country."
We beg of our influential contemporary to consider for
a moment what this charge means. We never heard of
it before. It was made,, if at all, by some one who de
sired to defeat a canal and at the same time* malign the
administration. As a vagrant accusation, general in its
nature, it could not be contradicted. - But lei; us look
into it more closely. The power to adopt a canal route
was by law conferred upon the President of the United
States. Does the Sun believe that President Roosevelt
was influenced corruptly and by money? That is what
the charge amoiints to, and. the one who made it and all
who repeat it assume the responsibility of accusing the
President of the United States of the most serious of
fense that an executive can commit.
Such charges have been made against Presidents be
fore. Mr. Bryan charged Mr. Cleveland with corrup
tion in office, and this grave and serious accusation was
part of the Democratic campaign material of 1896. ' But
no one believed it and. all judicious citizens regretted
that it was made, for the sake of the good name of the
country. All such will now regret that a similar charge"
is made against President Roosevelt.
When the President visited Nevada last year, the
Democratic. Governor, John Sparks, introduced him to
a great audience at Carson, and. said of him, "The Presi
dent is a good American. There is not influence enough
in the world to turn him from what he believes to be
right, nor money enough in the world to induce him to
do wrong." Governor Sparks greatly dignified himself
by that ascription. It is true. It uttered the belief of
the whole American people. We believe even 'that the
editor of the Colusa Sun knows it was true, and know
ing it should be above slandering the President.
He says. he is in favor of going on with the Panama
canal, and that it will cost two hundred millions in ex
cess of the estimates. That it will cost more than the
estimates is probable, because it 'n> Government work.
All work done by the Government exceeds the cost of
work by private enterprise. But the canal was made a
Government enterprise principally by the persistence of
the Democrats. They all favored it as a national work.
They all knew the consequences, and that the cost
would probably be greater, and they are estopped now
from complaining. Nor can they ask that the work be
confided to a Democratic administration, in the ex
pectation that the usual results of Government work will
be avoided, for they appear under all administrations,
and it is the partisan habit and business of the outs to
tell the country that only the ins permit such excesses.
As the canal is a work of such stupendous- importance
to the world, and as its. completion will be so conspicu
ously honorable to this country, why can we not have a
truce to partisanship" in the matter? It is evident that the
Democrats in the Senate will ratify the treaty. Why
not do it graciously, ta'ke their share of the credit and
seek partisan issues elsewhere than in this purely ex
ternal and inter-world matter? The whole country
knows that President Roosevelt will enforce honesty in
the work, will curb extravagance as far as oversight
and foresight can do it, and every one knows too that
any President would do the same. So. let it stand at
that and curb this bad and unpatriotic tendency to de
fame a man and gentleman and countryman because he
is President.

until your left hand, by which you are
grasping his right wrist, is near your
left shoulder. As you do this seize
his right leg just above the knee with
your right hand. Now your back is
against his chest. With your left hand
you are grasping his right wrist. With
your right hand you grip his right leg.
Keep your left foot far enough ad
vanced to bear the extra burden with
out loss of balance, and (by moving
your own body and hauling on his by
pulling his right wrist outward with
your left) bring the back of your
shoulders down across his waist. Now
rise to an upright position, swinging
his body up as you go, his stomach
resting across your shoulders,'* his
right hand and leg caught and held by
you u just described. The manner
in which his body is balanced, midway
ii cross your shoulders (again the ques
tion of the fence and the seesaw
board), the impetus of his rush and
your rise are such that you can thus
suing into the air a man of double
your own weight. The whole thing
depends on speed, accuracy and
(ubove all) on balancing his body cor
rectly across your shoulders.- When
once you have him thus in the air
you can drop him any way you please
cr dash h u. head downward if you
prefer. Don't let him seize you with
his free hand during the process. The
trick is, as I said, far easier than it
sounds.

One of these vulnerable spots, as I
have explained to you, is the solar
plexus. Another is the point of the
Jaw. A third is the top of the instep.
Remembering .this, try the follow
ing- trick if hard pressed by a street
loafer who is trying to practice unfair
methods of fighting:
When he steps close catch the biceps
of both his arms (as in one of the
clinches I taught you) in such a way
as to prevent him for the moment from
striking. As. you do so bring forward
either foot, toe upward. Throwing the
whole weisht of the body on this foot,
bring down the heel with all your force
on to the top of his instep about mid
way between the point where the toes
join the foot and the spot where the
front part "of the foot ends and the
ankle starts. As you do this thrust
him backward and land at will on his
movements toward the white man's conquest. One of
the most notable of these is the growing prestige of
France in Northern Africa and the probable early an
nexation of Morocco to the French' empire. That
country is too rich and too important from a commer
cial point of view to be left in the hands. of rac^s who
neither know how to develop it themselves nor will per
mit others to 'do sot Finally, the continuous disturb
ances throughout South America are largely due to the
inflow of commercial energy into those countries,
bringing' about conflicts between the interests of the
progressive elements of the population and the greed of

the interests of trade. By means of machinery, steam
arid electricity, civilization has attained such a power of
expansion that no quarter of the globe can long remain
free from its influence. The early years of this century
will see a revolution wrought in South America, 'Asia
and Africa, and during the present year the swing of
that revolution may carry us toward wars of extraor
dinary magnitude, affecting not qnly the nations di
rectly engaged, but the entire world.
The Mahatma s Monster.
He is "the boy mahatma from La
hassa, the sacred city of Tee-bet." Be
sides possessing a body which is just a
reservoir for all sorts of mystic Bud
dhist influences, curative controls from
the heights of the Himalayas and won
derful revelations of the ancient pow
ers of the sacred priests, this boy ma
hatma owns a rattlesnake from Arizona
and two healthy, pulpy Gila monsters
from the banks of the Colorado,; far
away. When he is not allowing | his
curative powers to be turned loose on
Grant avenue this highly charged stor
age battery of influences from "Tee
bet" lives with his reptiles up in an
apartment-house on Pine street.
It was some time in the dim hours
of the morning when a gentleman of
bibulous tendencies who had heard of
the small but deadly menagerie in the
boy mahatma's apartments was mak
ing a stealthy way down the halls of
the aDartment-house to his room. Just
as he turned a corner his toe touched
against something in the dark and he
saw an orange- colored object move cau
tiously to one side and there pause as
if to await attack. The scream which!
came from that bibulous gentleman
was even heard by the policeman down
in the saloon on the corner. Then with
a dive the bibulous gentleman jerked
at the call bell at the head of the
stairs, standing meanwhile upon the
marble slab of the hatrack.
"The Gila monster's loose â turn outâ
the Gila monster's runnin' around the
halls! They's two o* themâ they an'
the rattlesnake an' the boy mahatma
is all loose!" The harp that Tang
through Tara's halls was not a cir
cumstance to that terrified appeal. .
A vision in white and curl papers
bounded from a bedroom into the hall
crying "fire." "Hey, look out; the Gila
monster's there â oh, Lord, he's down
there on the floor, almost where you're
steppin'!" The vision gasped and was
up on top of the landlady's desk in a
second. By that time the hall began to
be crowded with the frantic lodgers. To
each the bibulous gentleman from the
hatrack shrieked a frantic warning.
Some one had already turned in the fire
alarm, and oolice whistles were blow
ing from three different windows.
At last, just as the police arrived
upon the scene and the water tower
was being trained upon the upper story
the boy mahatma from "Tee-bet" calm
ly opened his door and stepped out into
the hall, thick with gloom and terror.
As he -stepped across the flood of light
lying on the floor in front of his open
door his sandaled shoe struck an
orange, which rolled a few paces and
then stopped truculently in the very
midst of the assembled multitude.

WILL INSPECT THEATERS.
Committee of Oakland Councilman to
Make Tour of Amusement Houses.
OAKLAND, Jan. 4. â The City Coun
cil to-night decided to make a thorough
inspection of all of the theaters of Oak
land and to act upon the report of a
special committee in regard to condi
tions and recommendations concerning
legislation with a view to preventing
such a catastroohe as that of the Iro
quois Theater In Chicago. *
A resolution presented by Council
man Cuvellier was adopted providing
for the appointment of the special com
mittee, composed of the Fire and Water
Committee of the City Council, namely,
Councllmen Cuvellier, Elliott. Wallace,
Pendleton and Howard, with Chief En
gineer Ball and Fire Warden George
â¢McDonald of the Fire Department, J.
E. McElroy, president of the Board of
Police and- Fire Commissioners, and an
architect to be selected.
The committee will meet Wednesday
evening at the City Hall to organise
and arrange for the inspection. The
resolution provides that the committee
shall make its investigation at once
and report with the least possible delay
to the City Council.
Resolutions of sympathy and con
dolence from the City Council on behalf
of the citizens of Oakland to the citi
zens of Chicago in their great bereave
ment by reason of the Iroquois Theater
calamity were adopted- on motion of
Councilman Cuvelller.
A certified copy of the resolutions
will be sent to the Mayor of Chicago.
SAUSAUTO, Jan. 4. â The over
flowing of oil into the furnace of the
steamer Cazadero of the North Shore
Railroad caused considerable commo
tion aboard- the steamer on a late trip
last night. The steamer left the
wharf in San Francisco for Sausalito
and had gone about half the distance
when a., tremendous explosion was
heard and a great cloud of smoke shot
up from the engine-room. About 100
passengers were aboard and it 'was
at first thought the steamer was on
fire. Captain Boggee slowed up the
steamer and a hasty examination was
made and the cause was discovered.
Many of the men put on life preserv
ers and the women began to scream,
but by the prompt action of the of
ficers quietness was restored and the
trip resumed. The oil by flowing into
the furnace formed a gas, which
caused the explosion. Little damage
was done to the* steamer.

Conference of Grand Jury and City
Council Will Discuss Matter of
Safety In Theaters.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 4. â A confer
ence will be held to-morrow morning
â¢which may result in an order to the
four local theaters to provide asbestos
curtains -for the protection of the au
ditoriums from flre. The conference
will be attended by Colonel H. Wein
stock, foreman of the present Grand
Jury; the members of the Judiciary
Committee of the Board of Trustees
and the stage hands at the various
places of amusement. It is believed
that the Clunie Theater, the largest of
the four playhouses, is far better pro
vided with exits than the others, but
it is thought that the conference will
result in an order requiring asbestos
rurtains to be placed in all the
theaters.

TO INSURE SAFE THEATERS.
Supervisors Adopt Resolutions I>e
~i?ned to Minimize Danger in
Event oi Fire.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted three resolutions with a view
to insuring the safety of theaters in
case of fire. The first resolution, in
troduced by Supervisor Brandenstein,
is as follows:
Resolved. That the Board of Public Works
and at Fire Wardens be requested to make a
report to Ih? bean* oT the condition and man
agement of all theaters and places of public
amaseoient with respect to their safety against
dars^r from flre and panic.
It Is further resolved that the attention of
the Police Department be called to ths I fact
that the aisles. of said theaers and places of
amuseroen roust. tnd*r the law, be at all times
free and nnebstructed.
Another resolution, also adopted un
der suspension of the rules, follows:
Tbe Boards of Public Works and Flre. War
dens shall make regular semi-anncal reports

close it, but I should like to see a little
fair play about the matter. There are
a number of the smaller theaters here,
built in store rooms or such places, wltK
absolutely no flre protection and
usually only one small exit. These
places are veritable fire traps and have
little pretense of fire protection."
places of public amusement with respect to
their safety against danger from flre or panic.
, A third resolution. Introduced by
Comte, was adopted and "requests the
Board of Public Works and the Chief
of the Fire Department and the Chief
of Police to inform the Board of Su
pervisors as to whether any additional
legislation is needed In order to insure
safety in our local theaters and public
halls In case of flre."
No comment was made upon the
resolutions, which were adopted with
out any objection.

remain closed until the committee has
finally reported.
Referred to this special committee
the following proposed ordinances:
Directing one fireman and one police
man to be placed upon the stage, and
one fireman and one policeman upon
every floor of the audience portion of
every theater, the management of the
theater to pay $2 for each man at every
performance.
Providing separate exits from every
balcony to the ground.
Providing for the erection above the
stage of two standpipes.
Ordering an Investigation into the
matter of requiring adult guards and
guides at all exits in all theaters and
halls.
Ordering all places of public amuse
ment with 1 a seating capacity of 500 or
more to provide automatic apparatus
to open and close all doors to exits, the
system to operate in conjunction with
levers, every one of which shall open
all doors simultaneously and at the
same time operate electric lights in all
passageways.
Ordering that the names of the actual
proprietor and actual manager of any
place of amusement shall be plainly in
dicated by signs.
Directing that every theater shall be
provided with a steel fireproof curtain,
which shall be operated not more than
five minutes before the commencement
of the performance and lowered at least
once during every performance.
Providing that all employes and at
taches of theaters be given a fire drill
and be subject to Inspection and drill
by the fire marshal of the city.
Alderman Dunn Introduced a resolu
tion declaring it to be the sense of the
Council that the acceptance of passes
from railroads or places of amusement
be discontinued.
Alderman Hunter rose to inquire:
"Does that include the transportation
we now have in our pockets?"
"It does," Alderman Dunn replied.
"Every street railway or railway pass
we have is a small bribe."
Alderman Dunn asked for a suspen
sion of the rules to pass his resolution,
but this request was denied by an over
whelming vote.
MANY ARE RENDERED IDLE.
The closing of the Chicago theaters
by the order of Mayor Harrison has
caused paralysis of business In many
directions. Three thousand actors,
stage hands and people who depend di
rectly on the theaters for a living are
idle, with no hope cf employment for
probably a fortnight. Restaurants that
cater to the theatrical audiences have
laid off many employes. The hotels are
complaining and traffic on the street
railways has fallen off at night. It Is
estimated that 15,000 persons will suffer
from the Mayor's closing order. The
loss in receipts at the thirty-five thea
ters will total $18,000 per day.
Victims of the Iroquois fire still
living but not expected to survive are
Mrs. P. T. Kimball, Mrs. Rose Staf
ford and Frederick Patterson, at St.
Luke's Hospital; Mrs. L. C. Nelms
and C. C. Berry, at the Samaritan
Hospital, and Mrs. Emily Vaningen,
at the Presbyterian Hospital. Of
those reported missing last week a
number have been accounted for.
Among them are Miss Anna Ro
maine and James Frayer of Peoria,
111.
MISS STILLMAN'S DEATH.
One of the incidents of the fire was
the death of Miss Cora Stillman.
daughter of Professor Stillman of the
Leland Stanford University, who, with
her twin sister. Minna, had been vis
iting her aunt. Mrs. Edward Mulli
gan.
The three were seated in the first
balcony in the Inxjuois, and in the
panic became separated. Minna
Stlllman escaped. Mrs. Mulligan
reached the flre escape and. looking
back, did not see Miss Cora. She
fought her way back to the
balcony through the struggling
mass and encountered the wave
of fire, which burned . her se
verely on the face, neck and arms.
In some /nanner she found her way
to the fire escape the second time and
reached the alley, but her niece was
killed. Professor Stillman arrived at
Chicago to-day and will leave this
evening for* Palo Alto with the body
of. his daughter.
Solely from witnessing the hor-.
rors in the Iroquois Theater Miss Etta
Wild, 22 years of age, a public school
teacher, is dead. Miss Wild was
burned slightly in the fire. She made
her way unassisted from the fifth
row of the dress circle. She went to
her home in Calumet avenue and was
attended by the family physician, who
said she would recover â that her phy
sical Injuries were trifling. Instead
of recovering 1 she died of fright.
after the theater was entirely filled.
The day's receipts amounted to some
thing over $1700."
CAN SUPPLY NO DETAILS.
No information was gained from the
examination of seven ""men of the
double octet which was on the stage
when the fire broke out.
"We kept on singing and dancing
and did not even know that there was
a fire until sparks fell upon the stage
and two of the girls of the double
octet fainted," said William Sleek, the
first witness called. "It is the rule of
the stage that we are fined if we turn
our faces for an instant from the au
dience. All I know is that we stuck
to our work until we. had to run for
our lives."
Sleck's story was corroborated by
the six men who followed him.
The police to-day arrested George
M. Dusenberry. chief usher of the
theater, on a charge of manslaughter.
Dusenberry declares that he tried to
hold back the rush of spectators and
later helped to save thirty women
from the jammed front exits. He is
held to give evidence on the state
ments made by many persons in the
theater, that the ushers closed the
doors and that they at first refused to
allow any one to pass out,
Benjamin Solomon, a boy who rent
ed opera glasses in the upper balcony,
declared to-day that all the ushers and
attaches closed the doors and shouted
to the spectators to remain seated,' as
there was no danger. Coroner Trea
ger Is looking for the chief scrub
woman of the theater, who, it is said,
carried with her all the keys to the
doors and of the two balconies. She
will be placed under arrest as soon as
she can be found.
In addition to the managers of the
fheater, Will J. Davis and Harry J.
Powers, every one of the employes of
the theater has been summoned before
the inquest on Thursday morning, and
many members of the "Bluebeard"
company, who were not permitted to
depart for New York yesterday, will
also be called upon to testify.
RUINED BY HIS CHARITY.
John R. Thompson, the proprietor of
the restaurant which adjoins the Iro
quois Theater on the East, iias lost the
greater portion of his. business since
the fire. On the day of the disaster
Thompson threw oj>en his restaurant
for the dead and injured as they were
carried out of the theater. He sum
moned nurses and doctors, procured
medical supplies and did everything
that it was possible for a man to do
in alleviating the horror of the catas
trophe. His valuable and disinterested
services were widely advertised in the
papers, with the result cf driving prac
tically all his patrons away. He has
caused all of the tables to be removed
acd destroyed and has taken away all
portable furnishings that could remind
customers of the fire, but the fact re
mains that patron3 stay away from
his restaurant, and he is paying a
heavy price for the services he ren
dered to the public last Wednesday aft
ernoon.
An enormous crowd attended the
opening of the City Council meeting
to-night, it being expected that a great
number of ordinances relative to the
Irtxjuois Theater fire would be acted
upon. Their expectations were amply
fulfilled, and the Council did little other
business than to listen to the reading
of proposed laws calculated to insure
greater safety in places of public as
sembly.
ACTION BY THE COUNCIL.
The Council took action as follows:
Indorsed the action of Mayor Harri
son in closing all the theaters and
adopted his recommendation for the
appointment of a committee to inves
tigate a!l local theaters, which are to
CHICAGO. Jan. 4.â After to-night it

tically impossible to hold a public
meeting of any kind in Chicago outside
of churches. Building Commissioner
"Williams to-night issued an order clos
ing all public halls, dance halls and
turner halls and all similar places of
pubic assemblage until inspection has
e?.owb that they are complying with all
provisions of the building ordinance-
As there are more than 5000 halls in
Chicago, ranging in size from those
that will accommodate fifty persons
up to those with a seating capacity of
500. this order will affect probably as
rr.any persons as the theater closing or
der. Protests were numerous, but the
Building Commissioner was inflexible.
Ke said:
"Many of the?* halls are worse than
any theater in Chicago; some of them
ere put up with no restrictions such as
govern theaters, and many of them are
firetraps of the worst kind."
Two years ago a general inspection
cf halls was made, before the com
mencement of Building Commissioner
"Williams' administration. Notwith
standing this, the commissioner de
clares, he will take no chances and
every hall must satisfy the require
ments. The sole exemption Is In favor
cf private lodge halls, which are not
included in the scope of the order.
MANAGERS PLEAD IX VAIN.
Â¦Williams was notified to-night of the
election of Joseph Downey, a. prominent
contractor and trustee of the Board
of Education and ex-Building Commis
sioner, as chairman of the joint corn
ir.ittee selected, at Mayor Harrison's
request, by the various architects and
builders' associations to inspect all of
the downtown theaters.
Mayor Harrison and several Alder
xnen who have been appointed members
cf the City Council Committee to con
trol legislation fn regard to theaters,
met this afternoon with the theater
r-.anasers, every playhouse in Chicago
exceptir.p the Great Northern being
represented. The managers asked if
they could net open their houses and
sell s*a.ts upon the lower floor only, but
the Mayor and Aldermen positively de
cided against it. It was declared that
mO place* must remain closed until the
ordinance requirements have been fully
met. The managers, on departing from
the Mayer's office, reiterated their pur
pose of obeying the directions of the
Mayor and City Council, but urged
haste in drawing up the new ordi
nances, as the closing' Â°f the houses
necessitates great financial loss.
EVIDENCE IS DESTROYED
This afternoon attorneys for the fire
depiirtroent obtained (rom five wit
nesses corroboration of the charges that
a wrecking: crew of the George A.
Fuller Company employes had de
strcyed the stage skylights on the day
after the disaster. Fire Inspector Ful
kerson said to-day: -
"It was the intention that these sky
lig-hts should open automatically to al
low the escape of heat and smoke and
create a draught which would draw up
tvard instead of passing out over the
audience. But from the information I
have I am positive that the opening of
the skylig-hts was impossible, because
beneath each section of the lights had
been placed pieces of scantling, which
remained there until removed by the
employes of the Fuller Construction
Company en Thursday afternoon."
It has N?Â«n stated hy Powers and Da
vis, the managers of the theater, that
the hou?e was not filled on "Wednesday
afternoon ajr the time of the fire. This
assertion was flatly contradicted this
afternoon by Managrer Edward H
Price cf the "Bluebeard" company.

United i States Local Inspectors
Bolles and Bulcer began an investiga
tion yesterday into the sinking of the
schooner Mary Biihne on December
18, near Humboldt Bar, after being
run into by the steamer Del .Xorte.
A. Falk, a member of the crew of the
steamer, was drowned while one of
the lifeboats was being lowered.
Captain Frederick Nordberg, master
of the Del Xorte, testified that he was
in charge of the watch at the time of
the wreck and had an extra man on
the lookout, as the night was dark
and no stars visible. He said further
that the port light' of the schooner
was not burning brightly and that. In
fact,, the . light .was not visible until
the ship could be seen. .
M. Danhevig.^ master of the Buhne,
swore on the other hand that the
schooner's lights were burning and
properly placed. In addition he dis
played a flare light when he observed
the lights of the steamer ct midnight,
forty -minutes' before the collision oc
curred. The night,"- though dark, was
clear and he saw the steamer eight
miles ahead. He asserted that the
collision was due *o the negligence of
the master and crew of the Del'Norte.

A well-known citizen voiced the
prevailing sentiment in that locality
last night when he declared that the
tolerance of the scenes that are night
ly enacted on the cars running out to
the Presidio is an outrage on decency.
Respectable women who are forced to
patronize the cars after 9 o'clock at
night are insulted, with impunity by
drunken and insolent soldiers, who re
spect neither age nor sex. Conductors
and gripmen are powerless and police
men are never to be found.
Mrs. _Carney was severely but for
tunately not fatally cut. Her assailant
is a member of Company L, Ninth
Cavalry. He is still at large, although
Major Bigelow Jr. and the police are
making every effort to apprehend him.
The attack on Mrs. John M. Carney
near the, Presidio Sunday night, when
she was slashed With a. /razor by *
negro soldier, has aroused the resi
dents of that section of the city. More
adequate police protection is demand
ed, as the few patrolmen on duty in
that neighborhood are declared to be
wholly inadequate to afford protection.

CUSTOMS APPOINTMENT^
BY COLLECTOR STRATTOX
There is a likelihood that Young Cor
bett and Jimmy Britt will come to
gether in this city the latter part of
next month under the auspices of the
Yosemite Athletic Club. Manager
James W. Coffroth last evening offered
a puree of J1O.O00 if the champion would
battle with Britt before his club. Young
Corbett informed the manager that if
he fought Britt he would rather do so
on a percentage.
Corbett still insists that Britt weigh
in at 129 pounds nt 6 'o'rlook on the
night of thp proposed contest, but Britt
insists on weighing in at 130 pounds.
Manager Coffroth will see Britt this
morning and arrange a meeting be
tween the boxers. This meeting will
probably be held to-night.
Ring-goers of this city are anxieus to
see the pair meet in the ring. As a
drawing card it would surpass any
other bout that could be arranged, pos
sibly with the exception of a heavy
weight battle for the championship.
Coffroth expects to secure the February
date and bring off the battle of these
clever little men..
. Jim Scanlan. the American boxer
who wrested the heavy-weight cham
pionship from the foremost boxers of
Australia, will battle with Joe Millet,
local heavy-weight, who aspires to lau
rels, next Tuesday night before the
Colma Athletic Club. Scanlan is work
ing at Blanken's for the bout and is
getting into fine condition. This will
be his initial contest in this vicinity.
He comes from Pennsylvania, and has
a fine record. Since his departure from
his native State he has taken part in
a score of battles and has always gath
ered in the long end of the purse.
Millet has not fought since he de
feated Al Weinig. Joe has a hard punch
and is an aspressive fighter. He ought
to make it interesting for the Eastern
man.
. As a preliminary battle Monte Attell
and Jimmy Carroll, son of the ex-light
weight champion, are to go six rounds.
Manager Gibbs is making special ar
rangements for the accommodation of
the big crowd*'

Captain George Sprengel of the
schooner Neptune, who fired at four
French sailors on the water front near
.Vallejo street on Sunday night, will
in all probability have a charge of
murder booked against him, as Pas
qual Canevit, one of the wounded men,
is said to be in a dying condition.
Canevit was removed from the Har
bor Hospital to the Central Emerg
ency Hospital yesterday. Alfred Le
Rivere, the other wounded man, is
etill at the Harbor Hospital. His
wound is not dangerous. The only
reason Captain Sprengel can give for
the shooting is that one of the four
men knocked off his hat and he
thought they were going to hold him
up.
Canevit made an ante-mortem
statement to Assistant Bond and War
rant Clerk Kennedy at the Harbor
Hospital early yesterday morning. Po
liceman V. X. Bakulich acting as in
terpreter. The statement is as fol
lows:
"My name is Pasqual Canevit. I
know now I am about to die, having
passed all hope of recovery. I was
returning to my ship. I do not know
why â " He was stopped by a fit of
coughing, and resumed: "I was walk
ing along, I do not know the street,
with three others. This is the man
(pointing to Captain George Sprengel)
that attacked me and pulled a revolv
er and shot me twice. I identify this
man as the man who shot me."

GRIEF AT "DRY" ASCOT.
Racing Park May Be Incorporated if
Liquor License Is Withheld.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4.â The attend
ance at the present race meeting at
the new Ascot Park has been far be
low what the promoters of that enter
prise had hoped for and there is a
doubt as to whether the meeting will
be a financial succeas^One cause which
the managers say has contriatted to
the present conditions is their failure
to induce the Board of Supervisors to
issue a liauor license tc the park, and
throughout the meeting there has been
no bar in operation there. Only soft
drinks have been sold, and if a patron
needed or wanted stronger drinks he
either had to take It there with him
or borrow it from somebody who did
go tllas armed.
It is now proposed to form a sep
arate town of Ascot, to have It regu
larly incorporated, and thus be enabled
to control such. privileges as are usual
ly under the police control of munici
pal corporations. The new track is
Just outside the city boundary and it
is proposed to take a* section of coun
try including the park and apply for
incorporation as a city of the sixth
class. Lucky Baldwin recently adopted
this plan with his big ranch at Arcadia
and now he Is the Mayor and owner of
the town of that name. The proposi
tion will be presented to the .Board of
Supervisors and if a sufficient number
of signatures appear to the petition
the board will have to grant it. The
plan Is to make the new municipality
like Emeryville, so that Los Angeles
city and the county government as well
will have no control over the new mu
nicipality. If the plan carries the man
agers of the new track hope for better
returns from future race meets.
All teams of the league must wear
white uniforms while playing on the
home grounds during, the season of
1904. It is left to the managers of
the various clubs to select any color of
uniform they please while their team
is on the road.
The schedule committee was in
structed to start work on a skeleton
schedule at once and report to the
board of managers regarding the fix
ing of playing dates during the ap
proaching season.. The committee will
prepare a report and make known its
contents within the next few days.
No umpires have as yet been se
lected for the coming season. By a
\'6te *of the executive committee it
was decided to allow the president of
the league to select the handlers of
the indicators. These men will proba
bly be named within the next few
days and in all probability Jack
O'Connell, Jim McDonald and Rube
I/evy will be awarded the places,
though there may be a surprise in
store for some one.
. A strict ruling was made against
any captain or manager that attempts
to take his team off the field during
the coming season while a game of
baseball is in progress. For such an
offense the captain or manager thus
offending will be immediately fined by
the president of the league. The fine
will be at least $300 and may be more,
according to the nature of the offense
committed.
The annual conference of the Pa
cific Baseball League magnates came
to . a close yesterday afternoon. The
session was mostly devoted to the dis
cussion of minor incidents of the
league and nothing of importance was
done. By a unanimous vote the man
agers decided to adopt the playing
rules of the American League ot 1902.
SALEM, Or.. Jan. 4.â The Chemawa
Indian schcol football team defeated
the Reliance Club of Oakland. Califor
nia, on the Willamette University
grounds this afternoon by a score of
16 to 0. After a good kick-off, by. Che
mawa. Reliance got the ball and car
ried it by steady plunges to within four
inches of the goal. In an effort to
make a touchdown the ball slipped and
Chemawa secured It. This mishap
seemed to break up the Reliance team,
for they did not again get the ball dan
gerously near the goal line. Chemawa
madt one touchdown and kicked goal
in the first half. In the second half the
Indians increased the score to 18 by
matins two touchdowns. One event
threw the spectators and players into
the wildest cheering. The Reliance had
made a twenty-five-yard punt and one
of the Indians caught the ball. A Re
liance man met him as he sped down
the fields and stooDed for a tackle.
Without an- instant's hesitation the In
dian leaped into the air and went over
his adversary without touching him.
His leap was full four feet from the
ground and when he alighted he sped
on as though nothing had happened.
When he had carried the ball baclc
near the line from w,hlther it was punt
ed he was caught while attempting a
second hurdle.

GOOD DAY FOR FAVORITES
Albemarle finally struck a track to
his liking and registered an easy win
ner of the seven-furlong number, fifth
on the card. The gelding had but 99
pounds up and, at odds of 5 to 1, soon
assumed the lead and was never ex
tended. Colonel Van, played from 5
down to 13 to 5 favoritism, ran second
and Sugden came on from the rear, se
curing show honors.
Walter Jennings' mare Nigrette, a 3
to 5 chance around post time,' made
short work of her field in the closing
mile and a furlong selling run. Kunz
had the leg up and, taking his mount
out in front at the start, won all the
way. Position got the place very hand
ily from Rosarie.
Willie .See on Steve Judge's horse
Bard Burns took the first event, a five
and a half furlong scramble, at odds of
7 to 1. The 20 to 1 shot Goddess of
Night, with Sammy Greenfield in the
saddle, made all the running and was
only beaten out a neck. Flyer, a 40 to 1
shot, finished third. Planet ruled fa
vorite at 2\i to 1, and Smith's handling
of the three-year-old was as funny as
that of a Chinese operatic star endeav
oring to reach high C.
Last time Constable started Foley
was at the wheel and he docked last
of the fleet. Donovan rode the gelding
in the third race yesterday and, at odds
of 15 to 1, skinned down on the rail,
beating out Billy Moore half a length
at the wire. If McKinnon had not bus
ied himself trying to jump out of the
saddle Tom Slavin, which finished third,
would have scored. Nullah ruled a mild
favorite, and at last accounts had not
been sighted. Possibly her cargo shift
ed and Captain Larsen may come in
on the ebb tide to-day.
An analysis of the mud convinced
the experts that it was just Daisy
Green's number, and the Eastern mare
was strenuously backed to suppress In
cubator ar.d the balance of the com
pany starting In the mile and a six
teenth event. She made all the run
ning, but Incubator held her Bafe from
the turn home, Tommy Burns landing
the Van Meter entry first by more than
a length. Our Bessie cannot run in the
mud, finishing fourth, ten lengths be
hind Leader.
The kindergarten event, which was
the feature of the card on reopening
day at Oakland, proved a very fetching
attraction, for there was a large at
tendance at the track over the bay. It
served to introduce eleven spanking,
good-looking two-year-olds, and Bar
ney Schreiber's II
colt Henry Ach, ridden by Tommy
Bunts, was returned the winner after
a pretty struggle with Prince Brutus.
The victory Avas most pleasing to the
St. Louis bookmaker and breeder, as
his two-year-old Pinkerton carried off
the honors in the baby race at Los An
geles yesterday.
If clocking counts for anything Prince
Brutus and Henry Ach looked to have
the others up their sleeve. Bullman had
the mount on Prince Brutus, and the
Cameron entry opened favorite. There
was such a steady play on Henry Ach,
though, that the latter had first call at
post time. Once in Jake HoKman's
hands, the barrier etiquette of the elev
en youngsters elicited much favorable
comment, and without delay they were
sent away to a perfect start. Henry
Ach quickly showed in the lead, and
while Prince Brutus once headed him
opposite the paddock the Schreiber colt
appeared to better advantage in the
sloppy footing, and under Burns' strong
handling earned the decision by a head
in :3G â a remarkably fast run consider
ing the condition of the track. M. A.
Powell, owned by Milt Jones, ran a
gf> od third.
Constable was the star long shot per
former of the afternoon, winning at
odds of 15 to 1. Favorites were thrice
successful.

William Hubbard and his wife Anna
appeared in Judge Mogan's court yes
terday. Mrs. Hubbard had a discol
ored eye and the head of the house had
a battered nose. The wife said that
her husband had done the decorative
work around her optic. In turn he said
that she was in the habit of 'enter
taining a man named Hewitt at their
residence at'143 Clara street, much to
his chagrin. When he attempted to
drive the interloper aw'ay he was bat
tered on the noÂ£g. He admitted retal
iating on his wife by blackening her
eye with a teeny-weeny punch. Judge
Mogan continued the case until to-day
to see if the warring couple will not
settle their differences.

Cornelius Sullivan was very drunk
when he turned up at police headquar
ters on December 29 and weepingly con
fessed that he was wanted for mur
der in Chicago. He was put through
the upuai contortions and at the end
the detective department said: "Ha!
ha! We have him in our power at
last." " Sullivan was guarded as a pre
cious thing until yesterday, when he
was eiveh a public view in^ Judge Ca
baniss' court. -He is rather' a disrepu
table lookln'g . fellow, who appears to
have recently recovered from a full
sized attack of "jimmies."
The detective department has com
municated with the Chicago police, but
they do not want Sullivan in any form
or manner. Their directory Is already
overrunning with Sullivans.
Judge Cabanis3 sentenced Sullivan to
six months' imprisonment on the charge
of vagrancy to allow the police to in
vestigate more fully the self-confessed
criminal record of the prisoner.
1 Joseph Allen twice placed a capacious
pitcher in the hands of his friend,
Charles Jones. Saturday night and be
sought him to speed to the grocery and
bar at the corner of Laguna and Lin
den avenue, have the crockery filled
with foaming beer and lightly bring it
back. When it arrived Allen buried
his head in it, but refused to pay his
portion of the, expense. The third time
Jpnes refused to act as Ganymede, and
Allen smashed him on the head with
the' pitcher. The offender was convict
ed of disturbing the peace by Judge
Mogan yesterday and to-day he will be
given a bu'nch of punishment to be re
membered for his unclublike behavior.

D. J. Bradley is a painter by occu
pation and. lives at 72& Mission street,
where A. G. Fromin runs the Model
lodging-house. Saturday night' the
landlord heard excited sound? Issuing
from Bradlev's boudoir and 1 rapped
lightly on thedoor.- The rotrner opened
the door , and : rapped heavily on ths
landlord. . In fact, it wa? nearly cur
tains for the proprietor until the do-
John Kelso, who has been shooting
up Lombard street a whole lot, was
convicted by Judge Cabaniss yesterday
of violating an . ordinance prohibiting
the operation of quarries inside of cer
tain city limits. Kelso is not a des
perado, but merely a contractor, t and
has been endeavoring to grade a high
lot out Lombard street way with the
aid of blasting" powder. â¢ The, -property
owners adjacent testified that the op
eration was attended wjth great danger
to their persons and belongings. The
defendant will be fined to-day.
When the prisoner ambled before the
bar of justice he" turned out to be one
of the worst kind of wrecks from the
use of morphine. "Coyne," said the
Judge pleasantly, "I am inclined to be
lieve you are a bad coin. I think it
would be just as weir to withdraw you
from circulation for a time. How would
four months in the County Jafl suit
you?" "Thirty days is all, I need,
Judge," said the prisoner, who must
have solaced himself during the night
with yen-shee to have maintained such
a stolid attitude. "The last time I only
got thirty days and I came out fat."
"All right," said the Judge. "Come out
this next time like a bright new dol
lar, because If I find you smeared arid
battered again I'll lock you up in a
vault for a long, long time."
James Co^yne was asleep in the dock
when he was called "to answer to the
charge of vagrancy in Judge Cabaniss'
court yesterday. "Mr. Bailiff," said the
Judge, "please flip that Coyne a couple
of times." .
Judge Fritz yesterday held William
Harvey and Ben Michaels to answer to
the Superior Court. He fixed their
bonds at $3000. They are accused of
bunkoing Wave Copenhaver, a farmer
from Seattle, out of $1500 on the pre
tense of making nim a diamond-stud
ded manager of a theatrical show. A
man named Stanton is also wanted on
the same charge, but he has so far
avoided arrest.
The police will make a thorough
search for Joebicke, but whether or not
he wilj ever again wander so close, to
Justice is very doubtful/
Clearly some one blundered in charg
ing the prisoner with carrying bur
glar's tools and -concealed weapons.
He was certainly a desirable subject
for further investigation and should
have been locked up in a detinue cell.
Among other possessions he ' had 5iS9
and with part of this money.he fur
nished the cash bail demanded on the
charge. When the keys and "Jimmy"
were exhibited in court a few police
officers and Judge Conlan became in
terested at once. "Bring that prisoner
up here," said Judge Conlan. A search
was made, but no Joebicke could be
found. His name was called in the
corridors, but he came not. Then Judge
Conlan put on his roasting clothes.
The heaviest burden of his wrath fell
upon Horace Ford, who acted as attor
ney for t^ie vanishing Joebicke. whom
he practically accused of having inten
tionally interfered with justice while
acting as an officer of the court. Oth^
ers came in for less severe censure, but
the Judge delivered some hot ones
right off the bat to various officials gt
the court who had been derelict in their
duties in connection with the case.
He was arrested by Policeman Night
ingale on Market - street at an early
hour yesterday morning" because he
seemed to be acting in a suspicious
manner. When he was searched one
of the finest outfits of skeleton keys
that has ever come into the possession
of the police department' was found in
his possession. The keys were all hand
made, and were calculated to open the
most difficult locks. He also had a pow
erful "Jimmy" and a loaded revolver in
his possession.
Albert Joebicke, who is suspected by
the police bf .being a dangerous crim
inal with a long^record, folded his tent
like the Arab and silently stole away
from Judge" Conlan's "court yesterday
morning. It was not exactly an escape
in the ordinary acceptation of the term.
Joebicke was out on $100 bail and tech
nically at liberty. The manner of his
going, however, strengthened the sus
picion that he had no desire for noto
riety.
She said that her worthless son in
sisted on living aJL her home in spite of
her protests to leave her and go some
where else, In order that she might be
free from his abuse. She, had stood his
treatment for 'many months, and as a
final recourse and under the advice of
her noighbors had him arrested.
Abell doggedly admitted that he
struck his mother Saturday night, but
denied the repeated assaults alleged.
"I beat her oncÂ« before," he said, "and
that, was the only time I done it."
. "If you lived in a more excitable
community," said Judge Mogan to the
prisoner, "you would have been lynched
for the inhuman manner you have
treated your poor old mother. I'll riot
take any chances on mother love pre
vailing by postponing your sentence.
I'll give you six months in the County
Jail, and instruct the Sheriff to keep
you hard at work on the rock pile dur
ing ths period of your confinement: I
am only sorry that the law will not
allow me to sentence you to a more ex
treme penalty, because a wretch like
you does not observe the slightest con
sideration from man or beast."
"You are one of the dirtiest scoun
drels that ever came before me during
the five years I have been a police mag
istrate," said Judge Mogan yesterday
after he had heard the testimony
against Isaac Abell, a stage hand em
ployed at a local theater. Abell was ar
rested on the complaint of his mother,
who conducts a small lodging-house at
205 Second street and makes a meager
living by her hard labor. She told the
Judge that once or twice a week her
son beat her. If meals were a trifle late
he laid his heavy hands on her, bruising
her frail body horribly. As an evidence
of his latest brutality she exhibited a
frightfully discolored eye which he'in
flicted on her Saturday night.
. Bradley told Judge Jlogan yesterday
that while he was not heavily addicted
to stimulants he must have been re
covering from a heavy dose of knock
out drops when the trouble occurred.
He said that when he went to the door
in response to the landlord's knock he
thought he was at an initiation of the
Brotherhood of Painters and Glaziers.
He Imagined he had a stuffed club in
his hands and believed all his blows
to be harmless until he found himself
in jail. He was convicted on two
charges of battery and will be sen
tenced to-day.
lice arrived to rescue him. Then the
police were forced to send for rein
forcements before they could so com
pletely secure the custody of the paint
er &s to be able to place him in a patrol
wagon. ' '

Captain Armstrong, who was appoint
ed commander of the Coptic to succeed
Captain Rinder, arrived from England
Saturday night and to-day will take
charge of the liner. Armstrong was
formerly chief officer of the Belgic and
has many friends in this city. He was
lately in command of the White Star
line's Persic, running between Liver
pool and Sydney. Captain Beadnell will
resume his position of chief officer. This
is the second trip that Beadnell has
made in command. He has proved his
fitness for the accompanying responsi
bilities and probably before long will
have more constant use for the gold
vizored cap that only captains may
wear.
The passengers included the following
named:
From Honekcngâ Dr. G. ii'E. Brown*. W.
\V. Curtis Charlts P. Fcnnfr. Charles L. Hall.
Mrs. J. M Turner and child.
Yokohamaâ W. C. Grieve. W. M. Ktrr. Rev.
C. W. Kennedy. BertJicld Levy, Liuctenant H.
V. Simpson, R. N.
Honolulu â J II. Fan ton, Mr?. J. 11. Fantnn.
Mrs. II. B. Wilson. Mi>s n. Wilson, Â«Irs. T.
Washington, infant and n-.airl.
Dismasted Olivebank Docks.
The Coptic, which docked early at the
Pacific Mail wharf, brought a cargo
which once upon a ; time would have
made the liner popular in pirate cir
cles. Of treasure she brought Chinese
gold coin valued at $625,000. She also
brought one of the richest cargoes of
raw silk ever brought across the Pa
cific. It consisted of 1500 bales and is
worth 51,200,000.
On account of the holidays and the
popular desire for the domestic fireside
at Christmas few passengers traveled
on the Coptic. Among them were three
commissioners from the Philippines to
the St. Louis Exposition â Dr. G. d'E.
Browne, Charles P. Fenner and Charles
I... Hall. Lieutenant H. V. Simpson of
the British navy was also a passenger.
Christmas occurred twice and was
twice celebrated on the homeward voy
age of the steamship Coptic, which ar
rived from the Orient on Sunday too
late to pass quarantine. The liner
crossed the ISOth meridian December
25, and in order to be up to date with
the Occidental calendar that date had
to servo for two days, both registered
in the Coptic's log as December 25,
Christmas day.
Captain Bcadnell always takes good
care of his passengers, and as a repeat
ing Santa Claus proved a success. He
was ably assisted by Purser A. E. Ren
nie and Surgeon R. B. lronet, and the
success of the celebration may best be
judged by the uncertainty among some
of the passengers as to whether they
really celebrated two Christmases ' or
whether the celebra'tion Just seemed
double.

Until word is received from relatives
It Â¦will not be known where the re
mains will be buried.
PORTLAND. Or., Jan. 4.â Captain R.
Fulton, master of the British ship An
caios, died at the Good Samaritan Hos
pital last night from injuries received
last Thursday afternoon.
"While boarding his vessel Captain
Fulton fell from the gangplank, strik
ing on the ballast log between the hull
of the vessel and the dock. He was
picked up unconscious and hastily re
moved to the hospital. Captain Fulton
Â¦was bcrn at Great Village, Nova Scotia,
sixty-five years ago, and for more than
forty years he had been master of a
ealllng vessel, visiting on various oc
casions every important pert in the
world. He had been in command of
the Ancalos from the day she was
launched at Glasgow, thirteen years
ago. The deceased captain drew the
plans for the vessel, and at the time
of his death was one of her principal
owners. He has two brothers who hold
similar positions on British ships. One
of them is in command of the An
dromeda and the other of the Queen
Elizabeth: Captain Fulton's home is
still in Nova Scotia, but for the past
few months his wife has been residing
Â«.t Birkenhead, Enpland. A son and
a daughter live in San Francisco. The
latter was accompanying her father on
the last trip, but arriving at the bay
city a month ago she and tlfe second
mate were married.
The report urges that appropriations
be made without delay for the fcrrtifl
cation of both Subig Bay and Manila
Bay. \
"The policy of Congress may be as
sumed to be to hold the Philippines in
American possession as against any for
eign enemy, but, although the Islands
have been In our possession now more
than 'five years, not a gun haS " been
mounted nor an earthwork raised .to
protect any of our" harbors."
The report recites that the board has
the honor to submit to the Government
its judgment that the" national policy
as expressed in Congress cannot be
maintained in war unless -provision is
made for defense.
The board, it is said, is unanimously
of the opinion:
"That without a fortified naval base
in the Philippines the Asiatic fleet can
not keep open the lines of communica
tion for supplies from the United States
or between the army posts -within the
Philippines, without which supplies the
military forces of the United States
could not hold command of the islands.
/'That Manila is not. but that Subig
Bay is, suited for a naval base and sta
tion, and of all harbors in the archi
pelago it is the best for the purpose.
"That the fortification of Subig Bay
is essential to the security of a naval
station located there.
"That a fortified naval base on Subig
Bay will contribute materially to the
defense of Manila Bay."
WASHINGTON', Jan. 4.â A report
submitted by the joint Army and Naval
Board, of which Admiral Dewey is the
Benior member, relative to fortifications
for the Philippines, transmitted to the
House" to-day by Secretaries Root and
Moody, says:

NEW YORK. Jan. 4. â To-day's- stock market
was. much less subject to the Influence of war
news than on Saturday*. The feeling that some
other event than an outbreak of war between
Rur&la and Japan might be overhanging the
market had something to do with the Â«harp r.e
acticn from the early bulge. But the Influ
ence of the war news was not entirely, lacking
In the reaction,* as London renewed | its selling
on the advance hen* and Japanese bonds in'Ix>n
don did not hold all of their first gain. The
buying in the first hour was rather precipitate
on the part of those *"bo | had sold stocks in
haste on Saturday and who saw -nothing -in the
early foreign markets to-day, to '-warrant. -the
extreme apprehension of Saturday. The recov
eries of â¢ the first hour were quite ; violent .in
some cases and were quite 'generally as much
aÂ» 1 to 2 points. AH but a small portion of
these gains was lost in the second "hour. " The
decline in prices was not checked by the mark
edly easier tone of the call money market and
the progressive easing- of call loans during
the day. This development robbed the. bank
statement of its unfavorable Influence Â¦ and
pointed to the* conclusion that the $1(j,<jOQ.OUO
loan Increase was largely due to the annual
Interest and dividend requirements, such .as
would be released to the market again. The
satisfactory outlook in the money market was
the factor In the final hardening of the stock
market, which left a fair showing of net. gains
at the end of the day. Heavy corporation .bor
rowings are still counted upon, but the reflux
of funds from the interior is looked to replen
ish the local bank reserves. The return, of
f unfls to the New York banks is ' commonly
heavy during the month of January'-' Sterling
exchange stiffened sharply . to-day and no en
gagements of gold for import were reported
locally, but London advices stated that re
ceipts there of $1,250,000 of gold .had all been
tecured for New York. United States Steel
preferred was a leading feature in the specula
tion, c.wlng to the dividend . meeting to be held
to-morrow. Much Interest 4s felt also on the
showing to be made by the statement of earn
ings lor the quarter. The reports of the threat
of a strike In the Carnegie works, gave a
mixed character to the speculation, in the
stock. The strength of the London marketeer
raw copper was the only news that would ac
count for the strength of Amalgamated'Cop
per. Railroad officials continue to report' traf
fic well sustained end to speak hopefully of
prospects. Tbe market closed fairly- steady,
but very dull. ... : ... : ; Â¦
P.onris were -heavy, with' slight recoveries at
Home points. Total sales, par value, $2,430,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

The latest mail advices from New York- say
of Hops:
"No trading of importance was reported on
; the coaf t. A fair amount of Interest continued
; to be shown by buyers, but offerings were light,
due to the small remaining stocks In growers*
i hands, and they generally were disposed to
hold for higher prices. It was stated that bids
were beins turned down of 25c for choice selec
tions. . It was fi.Tured that the total stock of
Oregon hops in first and second hands amounts
to only 1Â»,000 bales, of which 5000 bales are
held by growers. 70U0 bales by Eastern deal
ers and 7000 bales by speculators. The market
for State hops was firm, with dealers ready
buyers of anything attractive at 30c. Stocks in
the hands of State growers. It was calculated, ;
do not exceed 2000 bales. The local market I
was firm but quiet. .The English market con

A G. McADIE. District Forecaster..
The Western National Bank paid a semi
annual dividend at the rate of 5 per cent per
annum January 2.
A final dividend at the rate of $3 35 per
share, amounting to $335,000. waa payable
yesterday to the stockholders of the 8an Fran
cisco Gaslight Company. This distribution
disposes of about all tbe assets of that cor
poration and measures for its dissolution will
now be taken. When the old San Francisco
Gas Company was merged with the Edtaon
Light and Power Company the San Francisco
Gaslight Company was formed with 1O0.OCO
shares of the par value of $3 each, to hiUl
and dispose of certain real estate that was not
turned over to the combination, and each
holder of old stock received share for share of
San Francisco Gaslight stock. In January.
1901, a dividend of 3ft cents per share waa
paid; In September. 1002. 36 cents: In Jan
uary. 19O3. 90 cents; In June. 1903. $1 5o.
which, with the dividend now being paid, will
make a total return of $3 47 per share.
BOND and STOCK SALES.
The gross earnings of the Vnited Railroads
of San Francisco for November. 1903. were
$533,567, an Increase of $44.3O7 as compared
with November. 1902. The gross earnings tor
the ten months to November 30, 1903. were
$5,682,034. an increase of $659,208 over the
corresponding period in 1902.
The Savings Bank of Humboldt County of
Eureka and the Home Savings Bank of Hum
boldt County have each declared a dividend to
depositors of 3 per cent, payable Jan. 10.
The- San Mated Union High School District
bonds, amounting to $23,000. bearing interest
at 5 per cent per annum, and maturing In from
one to ten years, have been sold to the Bank
of San Jose for $24,172 OS.
The only fluctuation worthy of note on the
Stock and Bond Exchange waa a decline in
Alaska Packers from' $133 to $137 25. ThAa
was a sale of $15,000 United Railway bonds
at $75 87 H. The market continued quiet.
The oil stocks were dull. Mining stocks be
came suddenly active again, with Ophir selling
up to $3 05 on a reported improvement in th j
mine.
Chicago reported everything subservient to war
news, with excellent buying by .New.' York and
the Northwest. Recent heavy sales of. Flour
in the Northwest are reported and Minne
apolis reported a good cash demand, . with sev
eral mills running that had previously been
shut down. . >
This market was weaker aa <o futures, but
the cash grain was still firm. The shippers
are- not buying, however, as their bids of

eomewhat of a flurry among Hay dealers yes

Los Angeles vegetables arrived freely and
sales of first quality offerings were readily
effected at the outside quotations. Pries still
had a wide rar.ge, however, owing to the
abundance of the carrled-over stock, which
moved slowly. Old and trashy offerings of

To secure & complete statement of the entire
c -;al oonsumjition of California I have been
ttsliged to include deliveries at Port Los An-
and San Diego by water, which have
hrrn Â¦â¢ 'Â¦''â¢ Â¦ 1 in tbe atiove sources of eupply.
â¢ The total amount received by water at those
X>ortft foots up ?3.2IS tons.
Fuel Oil â It can be safely computed that the
Caiifcrnlan products of oil for 1903 will foot ur
l.ttv^n Â»>.f)O0.Ono and 21.000.000 barrels, as
epainsi 13.000.000 for 11*02. Deducting the
*ji:*ntify which will be rÂ«*nned and the amount
. Â¦which Â»-ill be exported, there will yet remain
*-r.ou?rft for eteam uses to be a disturbing fac
tor In the consumption of coal. During "the
_j<ar there has beeti a marked advance in price
Â¦"of oil. The railroad companies ha\-e absorbed
â¢ tnoj-i cf the promising prcpertits, the output of
*hiih will not eeek buyers, hence the market
â¢price will net be affected.
It Is anticipated that the product of ell the
ooirirc yar will largely exceed the flsurep
' tor 1!iO3 and this may prove true, but thfre Is
fi'\< nee already before us that tbe output of
a large number of Â«ar older wells is shrinking
materially &n<l in some cases very markedly.
J'oke â The total deliveries here by water foot
>:;Â¦ O.O.iO tons, as against 04.910 tons last year.
Kully 75 per ce:.t of this amount was ehippsd
Tiotn Ijr.tijir.il and Germany, the balance prin
cipally from Bcitfum and Australia,
P;g Iron â Tbe total Importations by water
j-eei>-eate 29.S45 ton?: about half of this was
fclifpr^d from Great Britain. This would dem
.onrtrate an ino-ease of manufacturing inter
ests during the year, as the total amount re
i *-iiÂ«>d in 1K91 was M7S tons.
Thr- general rt-vicw for the year for the con
tumptlon of fuel and pig iron will clearly in
dicate that the yÂ«r han pro\-ed a profitable one
in the manufacturing line. . anl we have rea
son to bciieve that there will be no diminution
th<- coming year. In fact, the earmarks indi
cate that we have premises before us for' a
.rr.aiktd increase over last year.

COAL 'AND FUEL OIL.
Less Coal but More Coal Oil Used
Last Year by Fuel Consumers.
The annual fuel review of J. W. Harrison
â¢sj-f:
The quantity cf coal imported during the year
' i* 230.O44 tons less than 1802, as can be ascer
tained by rvf^rrlng to the figures below. This
cannot be accepted as the amount cf fuel to fill
.our rer.ulren-ents, a& the quantity of fuel oil
Â¦which has twen r/tfxluced this ye.ir hit been CO
jxt cent In excess of the products of 1902, hence
th* >u<m-ing made Icr the ccal consumption
car.not be accepted aa being a discouraging cr.e
for manufacturing interests locally. During
the early part of last year labor disturbance*
dpvelored In the British Columbia collieries:
tl)*f* were not amica.b!y compromised for Â»Â»me
considerable time. The abrogation of the duty
of C7 cents per ton on Australian and P.ritlsh
Columbia coals has proved a marked advan
tage icr their products sriJ has aided in giving
â¢large cer.sumers here a pronounced btnefit.
The duty expires on the 15th of next month.
It will be a marked detriment to our manu
'farturers and large consumer* of fuel if the
duty on coal doe* not remain eliminated.
The present position is a complicated one.
The ouHook for low priced Australian coal is
diwourassins, iwsrtially because the inducements
for farriers to come hrre are anything but
r.roftahle and partially because outward
freight? or grain from here are exceedingly low.
and prain freights from Australia are fully 50
p^r CKiit hifrner than from here. The quantity
Ot coal cf all grades on hand here at present is ,
*!v&ll. Tfcere are uncertain /actors now ex

rrand for fuel in the near future, principally
thÂ» r<XjU:rements cf our Government for Pana
ma na<i adjacent ports, hence the market is in |
a vÂ«'i-y uncertain -?rndltion. If the present out

and 87c, or a loss of %c to l%c from Satur
day's closing figures. The weakness: waits only
momentary, however, good sustaining ordem

symptoms, and flour was reported ta have

another decline, but around 88%c the price
became comparatively steady. There was a
large trade at times, with great activity when

known Dr." Beard - possessed the most â¢Â»iriti;
metrical and perfect . character: â¢ with marvel
ous self-command I and coolness of judgment,
he was- as >â¢ sympathetic and sensitive -as- a
woman; with an imperial intellect illuminated
with broad culture, his Christian faith was as
steadfast. aa the stars, unly last Monday he
said to me, . "Never* were. . the great verities
ot religion so real I and precious . to I me as they
are to-day. The .Bible with the light of mod
ern scholarship focalized upon it Is a new 'and
srander book than ever." Broadly tolerant, ; he
was a puritan in his fidelity to conviction and
would stand alone and die if need be (or what
be believed to be right. . '< " .
In his home life Dr. 'Beard' revealed a side
(if hla character little known to many of his
friends. There he was all tenderness, thought

and cross-complaint to the suit for di

treating her cruelly, as she charges,

for their matrimonial unhappiness she
is. He accuses her of getting valuable
jewelry from him on the pretext that
it .would be paid for and then giving
it to one F. I. Limos and Miss M. T.

the real cause of the trouble between
himself and wife.

When He Clubbed vfe Levitus
The chief witness for the Govern
ment, Howard Laws, night watchman
of the steamer, is in detention. He says
that Davis, immediately after commit
ting the crime, confessed to him.
By the capture "of Thomas Davis yes
terday United States Secret Service
Agent Hazen has covered himself with
Â£lory. Davis is a â¢ waiter and is ac
cused of having committed an assault
upon Mrs. A. H. Ames of Marshfleld,
Or., while she was a passenger on the
steamer Alliance on the voyage from
San Francisco to Eureka on October
16 of last year. Davis left the ship at
Eureka and went into hiding. Mrs.
Ames alleges that Davis, who wa^ a
waiter or porter on the "steamer, an
swered her bell at midnight of the date
mentioned, and in response -to her re
quest for a glass. of water, after which
he assaulted. her. She had with her at
the;tlme three of her children, a baby of
4 months and two boys of 3 and 4 years
of age. .
The matter was placed in the hands
of United States Attorney Marshall B.
Woodworth. who notified the United
States Attorney General of the case.
The. Department of Justice became so
much impressed with the gravity of
the alleged crime that a request was
made of Chief "Wilkie for assistance in
capturing Davis. Chief Wilkie there
upon detailed Agent Hazen to do the
Work. Mr. Hazen notified the Waiters'
unions and the* secret service officers
at all points on the Pacific Coast, Hon
olulu and Manila, and had all the out
going steamers from this coast
watched. Davis did not apply for work
at his calling of waiter, fearing recog
nition, and supported himself by doing
odd Jobs of labor inland. He arrived

wine shops, sleeping at night in 5 and
10 cent lodgings.
When Agent Hazen placed hi3 hand
upon Davis* shoulder yesterday after*
noon in the vicinity of a wine shop on
Montgomery street, the prisoner denied
his identity, but finding that his denial
would avail nothing he admitted that
he was the man wanted. He admitted
also that he had taken the glass of
water to Mrs. Ames, but denied that it
was drugged or Phat he had assaulted
her. :

LEVITTS BELLIGERENT.
L^vitus who disclaims any* connec
tion with the original trouble, appeared
to be a ieader of the belligerent faction
and insisted upon returning to the res
taurant after Fogarty had been suc
cessful in quirting the mob.
The fight was renewed and the po
liceman was again obliged to resort to
force Fogarty says he was kuked by
Levitus and that while, endeavoring to
place th* handcuffs upon him he was
compelled to again resort to the use of
h ; s club. While Levitus posed as a mar
tyr and said that he was simply on his
way down town when hostilities began.
it wa-s shown that he was on his way
to join several of the strike sympathiz
ed around the cloak house.
In the face of the evidence for the
d-fense and of many contradictions in
th* testimony of the witnesses for the
prosecution. Commissioners Hutton.
Drtakhouse and Regan voted that the
defendant was guilty, but Commission
er Howell supported the accused and
in a separate opinion said:

Patrolman James Fogarty was found
guilty yesterday afternoon by the Po
lice Commission of assault and bat
tery on the person of one W. Levitus,
xrho was involved in a. disturbance
created by labor disagreements early
last month. The conviction of the po
liceman was concurred in by three of
the Police Commissioners, but Commis-
Fi^rier J. R. Howell. who alone stood
fcr Fogarty. reviews the evidence in a
lengthy opinion and considers that such
action oh the part of his colleagues is
intimidating to 6tb<?r patrolmen and a
serious menace to discipline in the de
partment.
It appears that two people who were
mistaken for non-union employes of a
Market-street cloak house visited
Schneider's .restaurant on Taylor
street, between Ellis and Eddy, for the
purpose of getting supper. A boycott
had beÂ«=n placed on the cloak house by
union men and several of their pickets
entered the eating-house and demanded
that the susp^ted non-union .people be
refused service. When this was denied
an attack was made on the employes
of the house and in a short time a riot
commenced.
PoHceman Fogarty reached the scene
&Â£ quickly as possible and plunged into
the howling, struggling mob and was
obliged to upÂ«- his olub while subduing
the disturbance and protecting himself
against assault.
The police were notified and Detective
Cody was detailed/ on the case. Busal
lachi told him that while he was fishing
in the bay on Sunday his net became
entangled with Murallo's. They had
some words about it. but that was all.
Yesterday morning Murallo called upon
him and asked him to take a rifle to
the Cliff House. He consented, but
thought if there was ( going to be trou
ble'he was "able to' take care of himself.
Marullo shot him from behind as they
were going into the Heights. He and
Marullo had always been friends, and
he could not account for the shooting
unless it was owing to the net incident.
Detective Cody after seeing Busal
lachi commenced a search for Marullo.
Dr. Xiemeyer extracted a 32-cali
ber bullet" from Busallachi's back
and found that another bullet , had
passed through the fleshy part, of- his
risht arm. Dr. Xiemeyer thought there
was another bullet in Busallachi's
body, but said that none ofthe wounds
was dangerous. Busallachi was. sent to
his home. â¢
Thomas Manning, a track repairer on
th* Sutro electric road, ran after Ma
rullo. who turned round and pointing
the revolver at Manning threatened to
shoot him if he followed him. Man
ning thought discretion the better part
of valor and 6topped. but watched Ma
rullo till he disappeared among the
trees on the Heights.
Li. L. Burton, motorman. and J. Lef
flngwell, conductor of a car on the Su
tro road, saw Busallachi running to
ward them and stopped the car. Busal
lachi told them he; had been shot and
they conveyed him on the car to Dr.
H. A. Xiemeyer, Sixth avenue and
Clement street.
The police are j investigating a cow
ardly case of/attempted^murder at the
entrance to Sutro Heights ; yesterday
morning:. Frank Busallachi, a fisher
man, living at 111 /Vallejo street, was
shot three times. by' Alphonse Marullo,
also a fisherman and living on Battery
street, near Grab's quarry ,|
J. C. Cooper, a g-ripman, .living at 2436
A street, saw the: two; men walking to
ward the gate opening into'the Heights'
inclosure shortly before 9 o'clock yes
terday morning. Busallachi was about
five feet in front of Marullo. â¢ While
Cooper was looking a-t them Marullo
pulled a revolver from his pocket and
fired at Busallachi. who fell to his
knees. Marullo. fired two more shots at
Busallachi and' ran away. Busallachi
struggled to his feet and ran after his
assailant and Cooper, lost sight of
them.
