BERLIN, Aug. 23.â A command to
Prince Friederich Leopold, a consln of
Emperor William, to Join General

character of punishment- It has given
rise to an amusing incident.
The Prince is known as a sybarite
and he has disregarded In the past all
the Kaiser's suggestions that he lead
a more strenuous life. He hoped he
would not miss any of his Accustomed
comforts while in Manchuria, so he In
sisted on taking along fire hundred
pieces of luggage, together with enough
bedding to supply the officers of a
whole regiment.
The administration of the Trans-Si
berian Railway, however, refused to
transport all the Prince's possessions,
informing the Czar that the army in
Manchuria was in too great a need of
necessities to permit the railway to
waste any of Its accommodations In
this manner. After lively telegraphlo
correspondence between Berlin and St.
Petersburg the Prince's luggage wu
reduced to 250 pieces. This number,
the Prince hopes, will help him to over
come the privations of the Manchurlan
campaign.

HONOLULU, Aug. 23.â An Interna
tional tribunal Is to be established by
Great Britain and the United States
for the purpose of settling, among
other things, the claims of a number
of British subjects here, who were im
prisoned as revolutionists after the re
bellion of 1895. Over twenty claimants
placed their claims for damages in the
hands of the British Consul here, and
there have been volumes of correspon
dence about them, references having
been made back and forth between
Honolulu and Washington.
At the request of the claimants Gov
ernor Carter took the matter up while
he was In Washington, and was in
formed that the tribunal would be
called for the. purpose of making set
tlements. It is now over seven years
since the testimony was . taken in the
matter. Most of the claimants were
kept in jail for some weeks, while the
provisional government feared revolt.

General Goodnow at Shanghai to-day
cabled the State Department that the
Chinese Taotai of Shanghai, through
the British Consul, has ordered that
the repairs, to the Russian cruiser As

Grozovoi be stopped. The order was
made through the British Consul be
cause of the fact that the repairs were
being made by the British Dock Com

Acting Secretary of. State Adee has
cabled Minister Conger at Peking a
request that he report as soon as pos
sible the facts concerning the situa

has been addressed to Consul General
Goodnow at Shanghai and Consul Gen

Although no admission on that point

WASHINGTON. Aug. 23.â A sensa
tion was caused in financial and real
estate circles In this city to-day when
It became known that a petition in
bankruptcy bad been filed by three of
the leading- national banks of the city
egainst Thomas F. Waggoman, a prom
inent- real, estate and insurance agent
and treasurer of the Catholic Univer
sity of this city. The petition at the
same time seeks to set aside a deed of
trust recorded yesterday on Waggo
man's property for approximately
S?76,000 in favor of the Catholic Uni
versity, on the ground that it was void
as being an attempt by an insolvent
debtor to prefer one of his creditors.
â¢ The petitioning banks are the Second
'National Bank, the National Metropol
itan Rank and the National Bank of
"Washington, each of which alleges it
holds overdue and unpaid paper of
"VVaggoman'F. the total amount held by
the three exceding $40,000, of which $30,
000 is due to the Metropolitan Bank.
Waggoman had been in the local real
estate business since 1873 and was re
ported to be a man of large means.
He was the possessor of the finest pri
vate art gallery in the city and some
comment was caused several months
apo when a brief announcement ap
peared in the papers to the effect that
his art works had been turned over to
the Catholic University. At the time
it was explained it was simply a mat
jj ter of convenience, but it is stated now
that security to the university for
money had to do with the matter.
TOKIO, Aug. 23.â The Japanese pro r
tected cruiser Tsushima. alone defeated
the Russian cruiser -Novik. The first
engagement occurred on Saturday, Au
gust 20, and ; the Japanese protected
cruiser Chitose finished the destruction
of the Russian ship on Sunday.-- : ;
The i Tsushima found the j Novik off
Kdrsakovsk harbor at 4:30. o'clock, on
Saturday afternoon. She immediately
signaled her discovers, to the Chitose
by wireless telegraphy and at once
attacked the'enemv. The Novik was
hit frequently by> the ' fire from the
Japanese, cruiser and at twenty min
utes to 6 o'clock she retreated to the
inner anchorage at Korsakovsk.. She
was then enveloped In white smoke
and evidently on fire. ' ,- v
The Tsushima had received projec
tiles through bunkers 6 and 8. She
was leaking badly and listing^ and was
forced ; to withdraw out of the range
of the Novik's guns for. temporary re
pairs. ; These were effected that even
ing. Â¦ ; ~
The. 'Chitose joined the Tsushima af
ter-sundown of Saturday. The Tsu
shima/was sent to guard the strait and
the Chitose watched Korsakovsk har
bor.
At dawn of Sunday the Chitose ad
vanced to the Korsakovsk anchorage
and discovered that the Novik had beeii
beached close to the .town and that
the crew of the Russian vessel appear
ed to be disembarking. The Chitose
shelled the Novik from twenty-five
minutes past 6 until fourteen minutes
past 7 o'clock. The hull of the Novik
Mas concealed behind clouds of black
smoke and this made shooting for the
Japanese gunners most difficult.
After this shelling the Chitose steam
ed In to within twenty-five hundred
yards to observe the Novik. She saw
that the Russian cruiser had partly
sunk. She had a bad list to starboard,
and her side lights and lower deck were
under water. Her hull was seriously
damaged.; The Chitose satisfied herself
that the Novik had been destroyed and
steamed away. â¢
The Tsushima has been repaired and
is again in lighting trim. The Japr
anese sustained no casualties in this
engagement.

BERLIN, August 24.â In a dispatch
from Liaoyang, under date of August
23, the correspondent of the Lokal An
zelger 6ays:
"The indications are that the initia
tive is about to pass to the Russians.
The Japanese plan of campaign, in
cluding the attack upon Liaoyang, has
apparently been deranged by the un
expectedly, stubborn resistance at Port
Arthur. Â¦;', .â¢ -
"General Kurokl's army has been
withdrawn to the south of Taltze River
and only outposts are near the river.
Japanese troops, under General Ukash
ima, are reported to be in the Liao
River valley.
"It is rumored that the Mikado has
recalled General Nodzu and has or
dered Field Marshal Marquis Yama
gata, chief of the general staff at To
kio, to assume command of the be
siegers at Port Arthur." â¢
LIAOYANG, Aug. 23.â Some move
ment of great moment is in course ot
preparation here. It is believed that
General Kuropatkin, taking advantage
of the weakness of Kuroki's army, due
to the sending of men and guns to aid
the besiegers of Port Arthur, is about
to take the offensive and risk a battle,
with the hope that he will be able to
drive back the Japanese and create a
diversion that will give the Port Ar
thur garrison a breathing spell. This
would involve great risk, as Kuropat
kin is ctill greatly outnumbered, but
some movement of the sort is being
projected.
According to the latest information
from Porth Arthur a furious Japanese
attack throughout August 19 and 20
was repulsed with terrific loss. This
news was received here with the great
est joy.
There has been no serious fighting in
this region, but there has been a small
skirmish at Anshanshan, where Japa
nese troops attacked a Russian outpost
and were driven off with a loss of six
killed. .'-:Â¦<:

Many cases have been remarkable.
The chief surgeon apparently takes
great pride in the showing. He at
tributes it to the special character of

or six years ago on the score of the
humane nature of the wounds it in
flicts, disabling and not killing. He

Social Dispatch to The Call.
SENSATION IS CAUSED
erhof are gay with flags and decora
tions in readiness for to-morrow's cel
ebration, and though the great palace
is filled with distinguished guests, the
scene resembles a weighty internation
al conference rather than a gathering
of merrymakers.
â¢ The capital to-night is filled with sin
ister rumors of Port Arthur's desper
ate straits. The superstitious are pre
dicting the fall of the fortress on the
day of the baptism of the Czarevitch,
but this is easily traceable to the fact
that several big Russian reverses have
occurred on Russian fete days.
It is reported that a message was re
ceived from Lieutenant General Stoes
sel, which was sent from Port Arthur
on the night of August 22, by wav of
Chefu, saying that a desperate assault
by the Japanese had been In progress
during the previous forty-eight hours.
No confirmation of this report can be
had. While the General Staff does not
conceal its anxiety, the best military
authorities have not abandoned the
hope that General Stoessel will be able
to hold out.
This more hopeful view is somewhat
borne out â¢ by an 'Â« unofficial dispatch
from Liaoyang, saying that In a two
days' assaultâon August 19 and 20â the
attackers, like their predecsssors, were
beaten off with' heavy loss.
The situation at Liaovang itself it
quiet, but the improving weather pre
sages the renewal of military activity.
It is believed that if General Kuropat
kin is contemplating a diversion in fa
vor of Port Arthur it will not be long
delayed. - ""?,,Â¦
Conservative critics, while they are
not chary in giving the Japanese due
military credit for past performances,
say in plain language that the pace is
too fast to last and that every day
General Stoessel holds out will render
the Japanese position about Liaoyang
more precarious. Even the most san
guine, however, admit the gravity of
the situation from the Russian point
of view and the most serious news from
the front would not be received with
great surprise.

London Standard Scolds This Nation for Not Proclaim

of the Harbor of Shanghai.
LONDON, Aug. 24.â The Standard
this r morning, unable to conceal its
disappointment that the United States
Government is not prepared to protect
the neutrality of China at Shanghai,
editorially contends that -the United
States could have taken the lead with
out ' arousing the Jealousies and sus
picions which must follow intervention
by any European power.
The Daily Telegraph publishes a
strong editorial demanding that the
Government, adopt .rigorous measures
to stop the molestation of British ship
ping by Russianwoluntecr fleet vessels,
declaring, that "if diplomacy,, fails, the
British navy must clear the high seas
of the offenders." ' ) Â¦;_â¢ ?'.
The other. morning newspapers show
less excitement; because it has. not yet
been satisfactorily proved whether the
vessel that stopped the Comedian was
really the auxiliary cruiser Smolensk.
The correspondent of the Times at
Peking says that the Waiwupu (Chi
nese Foreign Board) is trying to ar
range a compromise by which Japan
shall be. induced to permit the Askold
to remain at Shanghai until: Sunday
next, when the tides will permit the
cruiser, to cross the bar.
The correspondent says that one of
the three officials composing the council
on army reorganization has left Peking
for Shanghai on a tour of- inspection of
the arsenals and the military equip
ment In Central and Southern China
and also on a mission of inquiry as to
what increased revenues are available
for army reorganization.

rail was missing. Had the gap been
two inches wider the Owl would have
been ditched and burned. Whether it
was a defective rail or foul play has
not been ascertained.
The passengers were much fright

SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 23.â The
second day of the Santa Barbara Coun
ty Polo Club's racing meet proved a
sad one for the favorites. The unex
pected happened in both the principal
races of the day, in the defeat of Ped
ley's crack ponies. Queen Rueker and
Carlotta, which were considered sure
winners by the talent.
The big upset came in the mile race
for ponies in which Pedley's Carlotta,
with Hudson up; C. W. Clark's Morn
ing Glory, with F. W. Wilson in the
saddle, and T. H. Dudley's Commotion,
ridden by L. W. Redington, were the
only starters. Considering the heavy
weights up and the slow track the
time, 1:50%, was good. The $2 mutuals
paid $6 10.
Queen Rueker, another Pedley fav
orite, lost the three-eighths mile dash
to Clark's Bas Blanc, ridden by E. J.
Colman. Dudley's fast mare. Ocean
Waif, finished third, although she was
not fit to start and finished on three
legs.
In the quarter mile race for maiden
ponies, Dudley's Trixie, ridden by Red
ingtcm, and Dr. E. J. Boeseke's Lucille,
ridden by Wilson, were the only start
ers. Trixie was away first and won
easily.
A notable feature of the race meeting
just closed was the lack of amateur
riders, C. W. Clark, R. M. Tobin. F. D.
Hudson, L. W. Redington, F. W. Wil
son and E. J. Colman being the only
ones to sport silk. They were in the
saddle in nearly every race.

there is an undercurrent. We found the

Greer Harrison, Williard Barton and
Jack Wilson. Joseph D. Redding has
consented to form an orchestra of
sixty musicians, and the programme
will be arranged by Charles K. Field
and Richard M. Hotaling.
Whatever sum is realized over and
above the expenses is to be devoted
to the preservation of the forest -where
the Bohemians pass some time of the
summer, and also toward the midsum
mer jinks expense.
The success of the original musical
work, "Montzuma," by Louis Robert
son and Dr. H. J. Stewart, and a pre
vious original by Joseph D. Redding
and Charles K. Field, prompted the Bo
hemians to try recently another musi
cal production, this time by Will Ir
win and W. J. McCoy, called "The
Hamadryads; A Masque of Apollo."
Important selections from these three
successes are to be rendered, under
the direction of the respective com
posers.

house.
On that auspicious occasion also will

. NEW TORK. Aug. 23. â On board
the Red Star Line steamship Vader
lsr.d, which arrived to-day from Ant
werp, was Mrs. Florence Chanler May
brjck, recently released from prison In
'England. Mrs. Maybrick pave out the
following statement:
"I regret that the state of my
health, as well as business reasons,
prevent my talking to my friends of
the American press at this time as I
should like. To them and to my fel
dow countrymen and women I am
deeply Indebted for their efforts In
ray behalf and I take this means of ex
pressing my everlasting gratitude as
Â¦well as words can, and also to thank
them for their congratulations on my
release, which I regret I have not been
able, personally, to acknowledge."
Mrs. Maybrick had expected to leave
the shir at quarantine last night, but
the plans went awry, and she remained
on her until the Vaderland docked to
day.
'. The immigration authorities made no
.attempt to question Mrs. Maybrick and
the customs officers did all in their
power to expedite the taking of her
declaration and the passing of her bag
gage. Deputy Surveyor Bishop had
met the ship down the bry and took
charge of things and a special in
spector was detailed to examine her
baggage in her stateroom. The de
parture of the party from the ship
proved somewhat of an ordeal, owing
to u large crowd of the curious, and it
took the strenuous detective sergeants
to gej. it to the carriages. The crowd,
however, was very orderly and made
no demonstration.
She left the pier on the arm of Mr.
Hayden. â¢ 'Yhat the curious crowd saw
was a sliglu, short woman with a thin,
Tvorn face and a r of brown hair.
The simple gown of a small black and
white pattern of silk fitted her closely
and was fastened at thÂ«? waist with a
"wide black belt. The only bit of color
Jn her costume was a heliotrope rib
bon and a flower of the same hue in
her hat. She was unveiled and smiled
at the staring- crov.-d. During the
voyage' across Mrs. Maybrick appeared
a few times at meals and in the cabin,
but remained most of the time in her
room. She was met at the dock by a
few close friend? and was driven di
rertJy to the hotel and after a brief
rest will make a trip to the Catski'.ls
before her contemplated journey South.
â¢ Young Leo Chrystal has wandered
back to his native heathâ unannounced,
but welcomed like the wandering son
of oldâ a sadder but a wiser lad.
As a large fortune had been left to
him by his maternal grandfather, An
tone Tresconi of Monterey County, the
disappearance of the lad something
over a year ago opened up a prolific lot
of "lawing." and thereby hang's a tale.
Bitterness had long existed between the
father of the boy. Dr. Chrystal of
Santa Cruz, and the Johnsons of Mon
terey, the aunt and uncle of the lad.
the upshot of which was a petition to
the courts by the latter that the lad's
father be removed as guardian of his
estate and they be substituted.
This action was vigorously contested
by Dr. Chrystal, through his attorney,
William H. Kearay, and while it was
still pending the boy suddenly and
mysteriously disappeared. After a
most vigilant search for the wanderer
he was traced to Honolulu, where it is
said he had been advised to "visit" by
his relatives in Monterey â this, how
ever, being vigorously denied by the
Johnsons. From there he slipped away
once more, finally landing in Australia,
whence a chief of police communicated
with his father. The strangest part oÂ£
the whole tale is the fact that this heir
to one hundred thousand dollars was
doing trapeze stunts in a circus for a
living, taking orders in an antipodean
coffee-house, or hiking over the bush
with the sheep-shearers.
Now he's glad he's home â likewise is
his father, who is a prominent physi
cian in Santa Cruz â and the lad's thirst
for adventure, advised or otherwise,
is thoroughly sated.
At the conclusion of the afternoon
session the delegates visited the Lewis
and Clark Fair site and made a trip
over the tramway lines of Portland,
traveling- over the most interesting sec
tions of the city.
The ladies of the delegation were ten
dered a steamer excursion this after
noon by the Women's Club of Portland
to Willamette Falls and on Thursday
they will have an opportunity of at
tending the annual regatta at Astoria,
indhming a visit to Pacific Coast
beaches reached from there.
PORTLAND, Aug. 23.â On Thursday
will occur the great struggle of the
present American mining congress. By
a resolution adopted by unanimous
vote that day will be given up to de
termination of the permanent head
quarters location. This afternoon the
committee on permanent head
quarters and buildings reported in
favor of establishing the headquarters
at once and recommended that either
Denver or Salt Lake City be chosen.
The selection of either will very likely
be preceded by a contest over an
amendment to the charter empowering
the board of directors in future to se
lect the place for holding the conven
tion each year, and should it pass it
will probably defeat the campaign of
El Paso for the next annual session;
otherwise the Texas city stands a good
chance of winning its vigorous fight.
Six of the important addresses on the
programme were heard to-day by dele
gates assembled in the big armory
auditorium and to-night a large audi
ence greeted E. Benjamin Andrews,
Chancellor of the University of Ne
braska, to hear his address on "The
Promoter, His Place s in Our Develop
ment." Chancellor Andrews presented
In a most interesting manner the pro
moter as having been responsible for
much of the best mining development
of the past generation, as well as prog
ress in fields other than mining.
The forenoon session was taken up
with the address of United States Sen
ator John H. Mitchell on "Government
Branch Mint or Assay Office," Maurice
D. Leehey of Seattle, "Wash., on "Min
ing Law" and the extemporaneous ad
dresses of F. H. Newill and Gifford
Pinchot. members of the Public Lands
Commission, acquainting the delegates
with the purpose of the committee to
learn the industries to which the public
domain may be utilized with the great
est good to the greatest number.
The afternoon session was devoted to
addresses by Colonel Frank V. Drake
on "The Mineral Resources of Oregon,"
John Daggrett of California on "The
Mineral Resources of California" and
Orlow W. Brown of South Dakota on
"The Cyanide Ores, Ragged Top Dis

Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, Aug. 23.-0* late there
have cropped out In various quarters,
especially at Esopus and at the Hoff
man House In this city, inquiries Indi
cating that the sincerity of W. R.
Hearst's professed loyalty to Judge
Parker's candidacy is questionable, to
say the least. His newspapers have
contained but halfhearted indorsements
of Parker, while complimenting the
"Populist candidate, Thomas E. jfct
son, in unstinted terms. The Jo^pril-
American of New York devotes col
umns to Watson's candidacy. It is
suspected in some quarters that Hearst
expects Watson to draw heavily from
the Democratic ranks.
It has been announced that Watson
will make his campaign chiefly, if not
entirely, In the debatable States. Wat
son will devote his energies chiefly to
attacking the Democratic party on the
ground given in his speech of accep
tance, that it is easier to attack an
open foe than it is to tear the mask
from the face of a hidden enemy.
Watson's speech of acceptance is al
ready being sent broadcast through the
State as a Republican campaign docu
ment. His campaign in New York will
be under the direction of Melvin G.
Palliser and other anti-Parker men,
who succeeded in getting William J.
Bryan to make a speech attacking Par
ker in his own State before the St.
Louis convention. These men. several
of whom have worked for each of the
two great parties in former years, are
plentifully supplied with money from
some mysterious source.
This year Republicans are predicting
that the Populists will poll a great vote
in New York. They expect that a large
number of admirers of Bryan will sup-
port Watson and that by this means
the Parker vote will be materially re
duced. The Populist party has disap
peared In the West, where it arose to
prominence in 1892, and Watson â¢ will
try the experiment of seeking to re
vive it in the East, especially in the
pivotal States. ,

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 23.â It is ex
pected that Senator Thomas S. Eard,
Frank P.. Flint, Henry T. Oxnard and
George A. Knight, leading Republican
aspirants for the United States Senator
ship, will attend the convention of the
party in this city. Congressman J. C.
Needham arrived to-day and it at the
Sea Beach Hotel. U. S. Grant of San
Diego will be here to-morrow evening
and Governor Pardee may look in on
his return from Atascadero. Lieutenant
Governor Alden Anderson is on the Ii3t
of visitors.
General George Stone, chairman of
the Republican State Central Commit
tee, accompanied by Senator E. F.
Woodward, secretary of the committee,
arrived here this evening and both are
pleased with the outlook for a har
monious convention and the prospect
of completing the electoral ticket with
out friction and, on an equitable basis.
It Is pretty well settled that E. H.
Vance of Eureka will be named for
elector to represent the First Congres
sional District. C. 21 Hammond of
Lake County the Second District, F. M.
Smith of Oakland the Third and Frank
M. West of Stockton the Sixth District.
George H. Pippy will be named from
the Fifth District and U. S. Grant will
be one of those named at large from
south of Tehachapi.
J. O. Hayes of San Jose may be
named as elector at large^rRIN. Bulla
is on the list of thea*Â»Â«rtTaDle from the
south. There would be no question
about the selection of John F. Davis
of Amador for elector if he was not
holding the office of Code Commis
sioner.
MUSIC FOR DELEGATES.
There will be no lack of enjoyment
for the delegates to the convention, for
the reception committee of Santa Cruz
has prepared not only to make them
comfortable in the new Casino near
the Sea Beach Hotel, but to provide
music anil a good place to "enjoy re
freshments, together with every op
portunity to take a plunsre in the surf,
if one is able to stand the cold water.
If not. a warm plunge is near at hand.
A heavy rain, followed by light show
ers, interfered somewhat with the dec
orators to-day. The convention hall
is a great improvement over that in
which 'the Democrats held their con
vention. It is capable of seating 1000
persona comfortably and there are a
number of adjoining: rooms for com
mittees and district conventions.
The decorations will be principally
flags and electric lights. Around the
galleries, of which there are two paral
leling each side of the room, are clus
ters of small American flags, each with
a handsome lithograph picture of Pres
ident Roosevelt. Incandescent lights
are scattered along the side of the nail
and three stringers of globes are
stretched across from the galleries at
the ends and in the center. A large
chaster of flags and a huge banner,
draped gracefully from the ceiling, will
be caught at the wall hy a number of
red. white and blue streamers of bunt
ing. Over the platform two immense
flags will be draped and a row of light.-*
placed back of these. Portraits of
Roosevelt and Fairbanks will be hunc:
along the walls and on the rails of the
galleries. There will be no evergreens
used in the decorations.
The convention will open with a ser
enade to the delegates and songs by
a double quartet that Jake Steppacher
says can make itself heard above the
most animated discussion that might
taka, place prior to the calling of the
convention to order.
Delegates will be met on the trains
by the local reception committee, head
ed by Mayor Clark of Santa Cruz,
and escorted to their hotels.
The Sixth Congressional District wil!
hold its convention to-morrow after
noon and J. C. Needham will be re
nominated for the office he has so ably
filled for six years. Needham la here,
quartered at the Sea Beach Hotel. So
far as the Republican State convention
Is concerned present indications are
that it will be more largely attended
than was that of the Democrats.
DEVLIN FOR CHAIRMAN
Robert T. Devlin of Sacramento will
be placed in the chair without a con
test and H. S. Wanzer of this city will
be named as secretary- Henry Lynch
of San Luis Obispo, who is contesting
with Thomas Flint for the honor of
representing the Thirty-first District in
the State Senate, arrived to-day. It
Is foreshadowed that J. N. Gillette of
Eureka will be the nominee for Con
gress In the^irst, Duncan E. McKlnlay
of Santa Rosa In the Second, J. C.
Needham of Stanislaus in the Sixth.
Nominatlons__have already been made
In the Third and Seventh. There la a
hot flsht in the Eighth between M. L.
Ward of San Diego and S. C. Smith of
Kern. The Fourth District convention
will not meet until September 22. The
Fifth District delegates have not fully
decided whether to nominate in Santa
Cruz or adjourn to San Jose. To-mor
row L L Dennett will make the lead
ing speech, nominating J. C. Needham

Refuses to Accept Congressionnipfom
inntlon In First District]
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 23.â Caminetti
of Amador got out of town some time
in the darkness of last night and left
behind him a letter declining the nom
ination for Congress given him bjTthe
First Congressional District. In; his
letter Mr. Caminetti Bald that for rea
sons statedâ absence of desire and
means to make an active campaignâ he
must decline the nomination.- He fur
ther stated that the serious illness of
his father necessitated his hurried de
parture from the convention city,
which would prevent him from person
ally thanking the delegates of the dis
trict for the honor conferred upon him.
His letter was diplomatically worded
and the excuse for leaving the city be
tween two days apparently, good, but
it failed to allay the anger of the dele
gates of the First.
"Somebody's got a lash out some
where," remarked one of the delegates,
and Caminetti has been pulled down."
"He should have kept his agreement
to remain here until this morning,"
said another, "but he preferred to leave
us in the lurch and he has weakened
our chances for success by his precipi
tate action and left us without an avail
able candidate." . '
J. F. Coonan of Humboldt, chairman
of the First Congressional District'con
vention, called a meeting at 11 o'clock
in Armory Hall. The situation was
discussed warmly until a motion that
Camlnetti's declination be accepted was
WORK OF THE CONVENTION
TAKES UP BIT LITTLE TIME
Presidential Electors Are Named and
Several Planks in the Original
Platform Are Modified.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 23.â Various in
complete reports of committees and
several hold-over meeting? of Congres
sional district conventions delayed the
programme to open the morning session
of the convention promptly at 10
o'clock. The Fifth Congressional Dis
trict completed its labors after a few
minutes of conference by renominating
Congressman W. J. Wynn.
Friends of Judge A. F. St. Sure of
Alameda, who had been mentioned for
Congressional honors in the Third Dis
trict, informally discussed a plan of
campaign. Judge St. Sure was averse
to accepting the nomination and for
a while it looked as if it would go over
to the county convention on September
S. It was finally decided that the mat
ter would better be settled before the
adjournment of the regular convention
ttnd a call was made fyr a meeting.
Judge St. Sure was chosen chairman
and Alexander Rosborough secretary.
Judge St. Sure in a brief speech
placed Henry C. McPike in nomination
and the secretary was instructed to
cast the ballot. The chair was in
structed to appoint the usual commit
tees provided for by law.
The committee on platform and reso
lutions were considerably delayed In
the work of preparing the platform
for presentation. Discussion arose as
to the advisability of allotving the
plank favorins the initiative and ref
erendum and that favoring the parcel
A delegation of business men of
Santa Cruz appeared before the com
mittee to present views objecting to the
system and It was finally decided to
strike cut the planks.
CONGRESSMAN BELL SPEAKS.
Few delegates appeared on the floor
of the convention hall before 11 o'clock
and in the interim Theodore Bell was
called upon to speak some "honest
Democratic doctrines."
Bell held the floor a while and told
of how he loved to serve his party. At
the expiration of his remarks a shout
for Congressman Wj*nn interrupted the
applause. Wynn was not in the hall.
Judge Conley, nominee for Congress
in the Sixth District; Edward E."
Leake of Woodland and Thomas J.
Geary of San Francisco were called for
and only Mr. Geary was in humor to
reply at so "busy a moment." as he
â¢put it. Geary had some district busi
ness to attend to and explained that
he could not add anything to the doc
trine* already expounded by Congress,
xr.an Bell.
Chairman Dockweiler called the con
vention to order at 11:30 o'clock and
called for the report of the committee
on credentials.
Chairman Leake read the report and
ttated that there - % were "no contests
And no proxies." The report was
adopted on motion of Gray of Placer.
The report of the committee on per
manent organization and order of busi
ness waa presented by- Vice President
Leonard of the committee. The report
recommended that all temporary of
ficers be made permanent. The order
of business was reported to be: Report
a committee on vacancies: Timothy
Spellacy (chairman), Thomas J. Geary,
F. H. Gould. R. M. Fitzgerald and M.
T. Cochrane. â
E. E. Leake of Woodland moved that
the convention extend a vote of thanks
to the chairman and secretary. The
motion carried.
D. W. Carmichael of Sacramento
moved that the thanks of the conven
tion be extended to the citizens of
Santa Cruz for the courtesies extended
the delegates during' their stay here.
The vote in favor of the motion was
unanimous.
An effort was made at this point to
adjourn the convention' until 2 p. m.,
that the First Congressional District
"might report, it being asserted that
notwithstanding the fact that the com
mittee had announced that it would
report in two weeks, answers to tele
grams that had been sent out might
be received and the nomination made
here. The delegation of the First de
sired that the convention remain in
session to ratify the nomination of any
candidate it might select. The effort
to keep the convention in session failed,
however, a motion that the convention
ratify in advance any nomination the
First District might make prevail
ing.
Next came the fun of the session.
T. J. Horan of the Twenty-ninth As
sembly District, San Francisco, was
recognized by the chair and gravely
said:
"Mr. Chairman â I move that when
this convention adjourns it ad
journ out of respect to the memory of
the Hc-rses and Carts."
The howl of delight that met this
suggestion furrowed lines In the cheeks
of Jim O'Brien and wreathed the coun
tenance of Gavin McNab in smiles.
O'Brien was saVe'd further pain by the
call for a vote on a motion to adjourn
sine die, which carried with the dele
gates still smiling at the discomfiture
of the representatives of the late Dem
ocratic League.
A majority of the delegates to the
convention were driven from town on
the early afternoon trains by a down
pour of rain^hat kept the oldest in
habitant busy with explanations . for
the rest of the day. It was the de
sire of many of the delegates to re
main in the city and enjoy an after
noon on the beach, but the weather
prophet could promise no cessation of
the storm. A few remained over,
however, and will witness, as specta
tors, the deliberations of the Republi
cans.
of the committee on credentials; on or
der of business; on platform and reso
lutions; on Presidential electors; on un
expired terms of Associate Justices of
the Supreme Court; on the report of
Congressional districts and Senatorial
nominees, and on the committee on
auditing.
Failing to hear a response to a call
for the report of the committee on
platform and resolutions, Chairman
Dockweiler declared a recess for fifteen
minutes.
PLATFORM 3IODERATED.
After recess Judge Raker of the com
mittee on platform and resolutions ap
peared with the report. A slight delay
was caused by Timothy Spellacy's side
caucus at the door of the hall and a
laugh was created by Chairman Dock
weiler's reference to "Mr. Spellacy's
delaying business."
Judge Raker presented the report on
platform, moderated, as mentioned
heretofore, and it was adopted without
discussion.
Thomas J. Geary made the motion
for the adoption of the report of the
committee on electors and suggested
that the secretary cast the ballot. The
motion, however, was put to the con
vention and carried on vote.
The only contest for elector was be
tween Dr. W\ M. S. Beede and E. E.
Bush of San Joaquin, the committee of
ten appointed to name electors conced
ing to the Sixth Congressional District
delegation the right to decide the mer
its of the claims for recognition of the
contestants. After much debate a vote
of the delegation was taken and re
sulted in a tie. An adjournment was
taken while some politics was done.
The result was that Bush withdrew
and when the delegation again met Dr.
Beede was unanimously selected. His
name was reported to the committee on
electors and the ticket completed.
The electors ratified by the conven
tion are: . â¢
John Garber of Alameda.
Thomas Bair of Humboldt.
A. F. Jones of Butte.-
James G. Maguire of San Francisco.
Frank J. Sullivan of San Francisco.
Eugene Germain ol Ixjs Angeles.

DOOLING IS NOMINATED.
Frank H. Gould of San Francisco
placed Hon. Maurice T. Dooling of San
Benito in nomination for Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court. Gould in
part said:
"No convention has before it a duty
more important than that of naming
a judiciary official. At this important
time both conventions. Democratic and
Republican, owe it to the people to se
lect men who by past history have
shown allegiance to the constitution
and law, and I am going to place be
fore this convention one of such men,
the Hon. Maurice T. Dooling.
"I want to name a man that we can
satisfy ourselves can satisfy the peo
ple.
"Judge Dooling is known and loved
throughout the State. I am 'satisfied
with his record and if I were not I
would not ask vou.to vote for him."
The nominations were declared closed
and the secretary cast the ballot for
Judge Dooling. . Loud and repeated
calls were made for a speech and Judge
Dooling replied in part:
"To say that I am deeply sensible
of the honor you have done me scarcely
expresses my feelings. The unsolicited
and unanimous nomination for so im
portant a position is . something, of
which any man might be proud.
"If it should be determined at the
next election that the office of Supreme
Justice is to be filled and I am chosen
to fill It, I assure . you Ahat you will
not regret your action or to-day."
Following the nomination of Judge
Dooling for Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court the nominations for
Congressmen were ratified by the gen
eral convention, the First District be
ing the only one falling to report the
nomination of a candidate.

SANTA CRUZ. Aug. 23.â There was
one good laugh at the finish of the pro
ceedings of the Democratic State con
vention when Delegate P. J. Horan of
the Twenty-ninth Assembly District,
San Francisco, moved "that when this
convention adjourns it adjourn In re
spect to the memory of the Horses and
Carts."
Chairman Dockweiler. who possesses
s-'me tact as a presiding officer, did not
put the motion, but the sentiment was
adopted by common consent.
Timothy Spellacy in opening the con
vention yesterday affronted James H.
OBrien and Fire Commissioner John
J. Barrett by inadvertently using the
appellation "Horses and Carts" in re
ferring to the Democratic League.
When Spellacy was called to account
be remarked that he had never heard
of the Democratic League.
A printed roll call for the convenience
of the delegates was produced at the
eleventh hour, but the names thereon
were not called, hence there Is no of
ficial record of the slender attendance.
Business was rushed through this
forenoon to enable the delegates to get
out of town and the Democrats went
away in the August rain. The ten emi
nent high class citizens recommended
for the electoral ticket were readily
nominated. The Congressional nomi
nations reported were ratified in a per
functory manner.
J. T. Coonan of the First District ex
plained that a committee had been ap
pointed to select a nominee for Con
gress in that district. The Eighth Dis
trict convention found a nominee for
Congress in the person of Dr. Lucas of
Santa Barbara County.
Gavin McNab remained in the conven
tion hall until the finish of the session.
The outcome of the affair affords him
special gratification. His grasp on the
party organization is firmer than ever.
Three wild cheers for Parker and
Davis were given by a few delegates in
the central aisle of Armory Hall at the
conclusion of the regular proceedings.
In accepting the nomination for the
office of Associate Justice of the Su

Merchants and importers doing
business at the port of Ancon in the
republic of Panama are interested in
the territorial status of that port. Be
ing within the Panama canal zone it
was taken for granted that Ancon
would be regarded as a coastwise port
and that therefore foreign vessels
would be debarred from carrying
freight between that port and ports of
the United States. But Congress has
not taken any formal steps to define
the political status of the Panama
port and because of that omission an
inquiry was forwarded to Washington
recently. A reply was received by
Collector Stratton yesterday to the ef
fect that until otherwise ordered for
eign vessels will be allowed to do busi
ness between Ancon and ports of the
United States. This practically leaves
it in the'eondition of a foreign port.

The rare privilege of hearing the
most ancient of ancient musical com
positions was afforded a large audi
ence, composed of literary men and
women, musical folks and many
clergymen, last night at the Academy
of Sciences when William Ap Madoc
voiced the beautiful harp melodies of
Wales.
Ap Madoc is musical director of the
Chicago High schools and adjudicator
of the World's Fair choral contests at
St. Louis. He is a master Interpreter
of poetry, revels in the plaintive and
martial airs of Wales and he has the
distinction of having been the dis
coverer of Cambrian melodies centuries
old. Last night he told the story of
the wonderful old â¢ masterpieces and
he sang one, "The Disputing Couple,"
said to have been written before the
birth of Christ. Another ancient song,
"The Black Monk," bearing the date
of 1090, and a fourteenth century
song, "Sands o' Dee," with its plaintive,
weird story, held the audience spell
bound, during the singing.
Ap Madoc was assisted by Emlyn
Lewys, whose accompaniments were
wonderful aids to the perfect rendition
of the marvelous melodies.
Before departing the audience sang
the Welsh national anthem, "Land of
My Fathers," both in Welsh and Eng
lish. . ...->.-: ':

ANTELOPE, Ore., Aug. 23.â Twenty
horsemen with blackened faces roda
up to a band of thoroughbred sheep,
belonging to Morrow & Keenan of Wil
low Creek. Creek County, on LittlÂ«
Summit Prairie, forty miles east of
Prineville. last Friday and slaughtered
1000 animals.
Young Keenan telephoned the news
to his father as soon as he dared mova
from his hiding place. A single herder,
watching his flock late in the after
noon, was covered with the rifles of
the men on horseback.
His hands and feet were tied and a
gunnysack pulled over his head. Then
the shepherd was thrown behind a treÂ«
for protection from the bullets.
A rapid fusillade of shots brought
young Keenan to the scene. But ths
boy, although armed with an auto
matic rapid fire Colt pistol, did not
dare show himself. Concealed in a
small thicket he watched the work of
destruction. When all was quiet and
the sheep dead or scattered far and 1
wide to be the prey of coyotes, the boy,
released his herder, who was nearly,
suffocated.
Plans for a Beautiful Reredos and

an adaptation or suggestion of the
famous reredos at Truro Cathedral.
The dimensions are to "oÂ» 20 by 20
feet and include a retable and altar
of polished marble, elevated above the
chancel on four steps of like material.
High above the altar extends the rere

The receipts of the School Department
for the fiscal year 1903-1904 were 51,428,
319 68, against $1,392,353 91 for 1902-1903.
The population of the city is estimated
at 435,000, against 397,300 for 1903.
Two exhibits of educational work, prepared
under the direction of .Deputy Superintendent
Macurda. were went to the Louisiana Exposi
tion at St. Louis. One was sent to the Califor
nia Department o. the Educational building and
represented work' In every school subject in
every grade and from every school. Another
exhibit was sent to the San Francisco Munici
pal building, and Included work from one pri
mary, one grammar, one high and one evening
school. The work was arranged so as to make
it truly representative of the Instruction given
In our Dublic schools.
The statistical report of the Superintendent
shows that there are in San Francisco six
high schools, twenty-three grammar schools,
forty-seven' primary schools and six evening
schools. The estimated value of- the school
sites is $5,000,000, and of school buildings,
$1,009,000.
There are 1004 teachers In the department,
not including seventy-eight on leave of absence,
apportioned as follows: In the high schools,
ninety-two â forty-eight men and . forty-four
women; in the grammar schools, nine men and
32S women; In the primary schools, three men
and 43s women.
There are twenty-nine male and slxty-ono
female principals without classes; two super
visors of music; two supervisors of drawing;
five of manual training; four of cookery and
two of physical culture. This makes a total
of 111* men and 075 women in the actual
teaching force of the city.
During the year thirty-three teachers re
signed, eight retired under the annuity act
and tbree died.
JS'lnety-three teachers were elected to the de
partment.
EXHIBITS AT FAIR.
There is an evil, however, which careful
classification . may improve. With the semi
annual promotion the tendency hae been for
a class to be assigned a new teacher every
six months â a wasteful process, for the teach
er and the children lose time in getting suf
ficiently acquainted for the purposes of serious
work. Many principals have remedied this
weakness of their own initiative, but the cen
tral office urges the general practice that
teachers' be allowed to keep the same classes
at least through the A and B grade* of the
year's work.
The changes In State textbooks, proposed and
partly Carried into effect, have made some
changes In our courses of study . absolutely
essential. The distribution of material must,
be made to correspond- to the arrangement ol
subject matter in the texts. In consequence
the Superintendent's office lg now at work in
the preparation of new courses of study In
those subjects In which the texts have been
adopted. Experience with tha course of study
that has been In effect during the past four
years . shows that some changes are neceh
Â»ary. While the spirit of the old course la
being kept, the new courses of study, already
roughly outlined, will reduce the work, make
It more definite, and finally distribute the ma
terial more evenly through the grades.
During the past year considerable progress
has been made in providing specia.l instruction
for boecial classes of children who cannot
be handled effectively in the ordinary class
room. Two uneraded clacses have been es
tablished, the flrÂ«st at the Washington School
and the second at the Hancock School. The
work of these classes in bringing ' up back
ward children has proven -most efficient, and
one such class ehould-be attached to each
large school In the city as. soon as funds art
available.
Superintendent of Schools Langdon
yesterday filed the fifty-first annual re
port for the fiscal year, ending June 30,
1904, with. the Board of Education. The
report tells of the progress made in the
schools and says in part:
: The Part . year l'as been one of the moat
harmonious and satisfactory In the recent his
tory of tha San Francisco School Department.
Within the year lines of progress have been
marked- out that will mean an , enormous in
crease In the efficiency of our schools. The
Board oC Education, through Its successful
plans for a bond leeue for school . purposes,
has laid the grounds for a more advantageous
administration of the school | system, insuring:
a material equipment that .will make better
instruction possible. The Superintendent's of
fice has takÂ«n upon Itself the active and vig
orous supervision of the schools, which is its
proper function, tnd has laid out plan* for
the Improvement of the educational work of
the department which will bÂ« far-reaching in
their beneficial effects. Already much . has
been done toward ', bringing about a flexible
uniformity In the schools so that the many
schools In the. city of San Francisco max be
trftly called a system. Improved courses of
study and better methods of instruction havÂ«
been laid out so that tha school system may
become the beat that careful supervision can
make it. Upon the past year's educational
work, which has contributed to the above ends,
your Superintendent now desires to report.

The inhabitants of San Francisco and
the surrounding country were treated
to a ctnuine surprise when several
rainstorms visited the city yesterday
afternoon and evening. The people
were not the only ones, however, to be
surprised. The astonishment extended
to the Weather Bureau where Profeesor
McAdie, while feeling In his heart that
a storm was coming, hseitated to
launch the prediction on the unsus
pecting: public He might bo excused
In thin, however, aa the last August
rainstorm that visited San Francisco
came in 1S64. Just forty years ago, and
lasted three days. During that time
.OS of an inch fell, while yesterday's
rainfall was only .01 on an Inch.
An interesting fact in connection
with yesterday's etorm was that rain
fell In San Francisco a few minutes
later than at the Farallones. It reach
ed Point Rexes even later still. Usu
ally storms etrike the Farallones before
reaching the city, but this storm was
in keeping with the present uncertain
ty of the weather.
- At the Farallones and Point Reyes
distant thunder was reported, while In
San Francisco one feeble rumble waa
Â§31 the storm could accomplish.
The difficulty in making predictions
of rain is apparent when it is remem
bered that last July Professor McAdie,
in face of sarcastic unbelief, predicted
rain. He prophesied correctly, how
ever, and for the first time in fifty
five years rain fell in the month of
July, amounting to .02 of an inch.
Regarding the cause of the variable
weather Professor McAdie advanced a
/iovel theory. He said he had no meth
od of proving it to be true, but that it
was a probable way of accounting for
the uncertain conditions. The storms
in the West Indian hurricane belt have
been late this year and by the shifting
of thÂ»* high permanent pressure from
sub-tropic storms the Pacific high pres
sure has been driven seaward, allow
ing tropical rains to advance north
0 ward through the low pressure val
ley. Th?se norms therefore v.-ill pass
over northern California to-night and
to-morrow and continue in a north
eat-ierly direction toward the Great
Lakes. In the opinion of the Weather
Buieau's chief this is not the begin
,r;n^ of a prolonged rainv season, as
'he hoocs that with the beguiling of
.UiÂ«? West Indian storms the unusual
< â¢â¢nc'ti<ms will be chained.
Five trains, westbound, are now be
ing held at Ash Fork. One of them
is a Knijrhts Templar special from Tor

Trains of both the Santa Fe and

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23.â After re

admit that the washouts were the most
serious the road has ever experienced
in the Territory. The damage, while
affecting only parts of the road which
were injured by former, floods, is ex
tensive and only temporary- repairs are
possible for the present. The roadbed
is in such a condition, as a result of
the repeated floods, that every recur
ring rain carries out the temporary
work and stops traffic.
Another bridge at Powell is reported
to have gone out to-day and several
hundred feet of road in that vicinity
is under water. It will be some time
before the blockade can be cleared and
possibly the trains at Ash Fork will
be sent east and moved to California
by way of Denver>
Five westbound overland trains are
now stalled here. The only way out
of Ash Fork at present is over the
Maricopa and Phoenix Railroad, then
by the Southern Pacific. Five miles of
roadbed was washed out near Mari
copa last night. Large gangs are mak
ing repairs in that section. No. 1,
which left Ash Fork about noon yes
terday, proceeded only as far as Selig
man, nineteen miles west.
Westbound overland trains No. 7, the
California limited. No. 3 and the Cuth
bert special from Ontario with 200 Ca
nadian business men on a tour of this
country, who were visiting for two
days at Grand Can-von, have been tied
up at this point with no present pros
pects of moving. The eastbound lim
ited No. 4 and No. 8 on the Santa Fe
are being held west of Yucca. Two
more westbound overland trains ar
rived here at noon and will remain on
side tracks until further orders.
It is impossible to send trains via
Phoenix, as the Southern Pacific has
also suffered much damage from the
heavy rains which have been falling
a great part of the last week.
All communication west of Haviland
has been cut off. Orders have been
sent *a%t to rush gangs of linemen to
the scene. The Santa Fe is employing
all available help.
ASH FORK, Ariz.. Aug. 23.â The
flood of yesterday has caused the
greatest washouts ever suffered bv the
Santa Fe Railroad in Arizona. Six
hundred feet of road has been de
stroyed between Yucca and Haviland.
Bridges, large and small, have been
carried away and the entire country
between Kineman, Ariz., and . The
Needles, Cal., has been flooded. Water
is still rushing over the tracks and
great damage has occurred at many
sections.
A terrific storm last night caused
many freshet washouts on the main
line of the Santa Fe. At Haviland,
six miles east of Yucca, where a large
bridge was destroyed yesterday after
noon, the roadbed is flooded to a depth
of seven feet.
TOXOPAH. Nev.. Aug. 23.â Another
clopdburst occurred on the line of the
Tor.opah and the Carson and Colorado
railroads yesterday afternoon, washing
out several miles of track and demor
alizing traffic on the Tonopah road.
The terrible fall of water occurred late
In the afternoon and for several hours
the country in the vicinity of Soda
ville was under water. Twenty-eight
miles south of Sodaville two miles of
track on the Carson and Colorado road
was washed away by the wall of water
that rushed down the canyon and on
the Tonopah road for miles the newly
made embankments were ruined and
the tracks washed out of place.
The eastbound train on the Tonopah
road was caught by the storm five
miles out of Sodaville and wrecked.
The engine and one coach left the
track, the coach rolling over and down
the embankment. No one was killed,
but several passengers sustained slight
injuries.
The Tonopah road Is totally demoral
ized. Its tracks are washed out for
miles and it is feared that it cannot be
reopened for a week. The washout ex
ceeds that of August 12, which tied up
the road for several days.
Tonopah and Goldfield are both short
of provisions as a result of the recent
washout. Nearly 100 cars of merchan
dise for the two camps are standing
on the tracks at Reno, Carson and
Mound House and it may tie ten days
before these can be gotten through to
their destination.
In addition to the losses sustained by
the railroads, many ranchers will lose
heavily.

Not a Chinese lottery den was in
business to-day In Oakland. The raids
made by the police have accomplished
their purpose. The yellow gamblers,
realizing that the police plan ' of
campaign means the destruction of
their illegally used property, have
closed down business. Police reports
from every beat in the city are in the
same tenor, namely: All "Joints" closed
and no visitors at any of them.
It was like- a bolt from a clear sky
Saturday night when the police
smashed their way Into the China
town resorts. The raid was an earnest
of more to follow and the Chinese boss
gamblers have decided that the best
way out of the present situation Is to
cease their unlawful traffic.
This condition the police expect to
maintain, using the threat of resump
tion of violent raids, should any of the
gambling houses reopen.

Superintendent Waterman said that
he expected trouble with at least one
parent over the vaclnation order, which
might call for an appeal to the courts,
but in , the absence of authority from
the Board of Education to proceed he
refused to divulge the nature of the
difficulty.
Opposition to the compulsory vaccin
ation law for^chool children lost half
of ita force to-day 'when 100 more pu
pils returned to their classrooms with
certificates to show that they had been
duly vaccinated. More than 200 chil
dren were excluded from the schools
by order of the Board of Education
yesterday, but as predicted by School
Superintendent S. D. Waterman, half
of these fulfilled the requirements of
the department to-day. Now there are
less than 100 children being excluded
from the schools on account of the vac
cination, but even this number will be
largely reduced within the next few
days.
"It is just as I thought," said School
Superintendent Waterman to-day. "A$.
soon as the parents saw that the board
meant to enforce its order they re
treated from their defiant position. I
don't believe there will be more than
fifty remaining out of the schools at
the end of the week."

During all of Dr. Crowley's marital
uiisettings he has ever maintained a
silence with relation to much that has
fcrced him so unwillingly Into public
gaze.' His friends declare that he has
been In many particulars a grievously
persecuted man. Even at this time
Dr. Crowley* has avoided a controversy
with his wife touching any of their
unhappy matrimonial experiences.
Since the last separation Dr. Crowley
has made a monthly allowance of $200
to his wife, which has enabled her to
maintain herself and children prop
erly.
Mrs. Crowley has won repute in the
musical world as a brilliant singer
and accomplished composer. In years
gone by she was a prominent figure
In Oakland society. Her beauty was
enhanced by a splendid mental equip
ment, which combined to make an at
tractive presence. Dr. Crowley has
been a leader for many years in his
profession. He holds the post of chief
of staff of surgeons, with rank of col
onel, in the National Guard of Cali
fornia and Is district surgeon of the
Santa Fe Railroad, with headquarters
in Oakland.
It is understood that the divorce
suit will not be contested.

public affairs of the Crowleys. Now
comes the second complaint in di
vorce.
It was not long, however, until Mrs.
Crowley, charging cruelty, divorced her
husband. The separation was followed
by another making, up. The chap
ter . of troubles was closed tempo
rarily by the Crowleys* remarriage at
Reno. Upon their return they settled
down to home life once more at the
family residence, 1164 Alice street. A
year or.more passed quietly. Then one
day Dr. Crowley took his personal ef
fects and repaired to bachelors' quar
ters at the Athenian Club. There was
another cloud upon the horizon. , It
grew and grew. Mrs. Crowley sudden
ly added a fresh leaf to' the book of
disturbance by attacking her husband
with a horsewhip one evening as he
left the residence of Mrs. A. Seligman.
585 Caledonia avenue. The physician's
wife charged that his visits at the
Seligman residence were not: prompted
by professional reasons. â¢ Â¦ â¢
The incident caused Harry M.- Selig
man, son of Mrs. Seligman, to defend
his mother's name. Â¦ Young Seligman
went to the Crowley residence and de
manded that Mrs. Crowley make publio
apology. He declared that Dr. Crow
ley had been called to the Seligman
house on a professional visit, ttiat he
(the son) had been there during the
visit; that Mrs. Crowley had wantonly
laid his mother open to scandal. After
much colloquy Mrs;" Crowley caused the
young defender's arrest on a charge 'of
disturbing the peace, but Â¦ she did riot
appear to prosecute him. "
That closed for the time -beinx 1 tJjo
OAKLAND. Aug. 23. â After more
than. a year of separation, following
a horse whipping episode, Mr9. Alma
A. Crowley to-day sued Dr. D. D.
Crowley for divorce for the second
time since their first marriage ten
years ago. Statutory desertion is the
allegation set forth in the complaint,
which was filed by Henry C. McPike,
attorney for Mrs. Crowley. The phy
sician's wife avers that Dr. Crowlev's
Income is $2000 a month. She asks
for alimony, amount to be determined,
for support of herself and the Crow
ley children, two boys, of whom she
wants the custody.
Thus culminates a series of marital
disturbances that' now record two
steps in the divorce court with a di
vorce caae at the very beginning of the
Crowleys' matrimonial experiences.
When Alma Crowley first met the tal
ented physician and surgeon from
whom she seeks for the second time
a- legal separation, she was the beau
tiful wife of Hugo Mansfeldt, a musi
cian of more than local fame. She
had been Mansfeldt's pupil and over
the harmonies and chromatics Cupid
chimed until Mansfeldt won his schol
ar for a bride.
The Mansfeldts were happy for a
time. But it was not long. Mrs.
Mansfeldt procured a divorce from
her musician spouse and wedded Dr.
Crowley. Again domestic felicity was
of brief duration. One day Mrs.
Crowley went to her husband's offices,
then on Broadway and Twelfth street
in the Central block, and made accu
sations in the face of one of his pa
tients. There was a violent scene. The
angry wife, with her children, fled to
a hotel and there remained until a
reconciliation reunited the family.

OAKLAND, Aug. 23. â The young society

fsculty of providing many pleasant and orig
inal wars of entertaining themselves and each
ether and as the mansions in that aristocratic
part of Oakland were nearly all erected with

In the living-room a small stage had been
Â«iected and there a number of charades were
enacted by the guests. The tableaux represent

OAKLAND. Aug 23. â The Young
Men's Christian Association of this

raise the balance of the $200,000 need
ed to erect the new Y. M. C. A. build-
Ing, for which the members of the as

A report of the canvass which was
read at a conference of the citizens'
committee, the young business men's
committee and the members' commit
tee, which was held this evening.
showed that $150,000 of the necessary
fund had already been pledged.
This includes the fund ,of $30,000
pledged by the Ladies' Auxiliary of
the Y. M. C. A., of which only $12,000
has so far been secured, so that in
reality the available funds for the new
building amount to $132,000.

As for the Ore the other night there la no
question as to the skill shown by Chief Krauth.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 23.â The Alameda
Volunteer Fire Department is doomed
and the City Trustees are preparing to
find ways and means to add. to the
equipment. They are also discussing
the erection of a pumping plant that
will furnish sufficient water to handle
a fire. ;
These three points are the outcome
of the Sherman street fire, the charges
that Chief Krauth did not handle the
fire properly and the Investigation that
was held of these charges by the Trus
tees last night.
It was conclusively shown that Chief
Krauth handled the fire in a most sci
entific manner, that everything was
done by him and by his men, but it
was also shown that Alameda had long
since outgrown its present Fire De
partment. President Forderer of the
City Trustees to-day announced the
new Fire Department plans:
"We found out a great deal about our Fire
Department last night and we will take up
the work of improving It as rapidly as possible.
The city has long since outgrown a volunteer
fire department and we shall have to do away
with the present system and establish a paid
call department. A paid call department iÂ»
easier to handle and more subject to discipline
than a volunteer one. We will probably have
to increase the equipment, though to what ex
tent remains to be determined.
In order to Increase the, water pressure and
water supply we may have to resort to^i pump-
Ing plant, but as that will cost $10,00"T, and as
our tax levy will be higher than last year
without this improvement, I don't see how It
can be considered now.
Dr. Ritter has really contemplated
resigning for some time and it only
needed this accident to decide for her
a vexed Question. She gave up a lu
crative practice to accept the compar
atively small salary of $200 a month to
act as examiner of women and lecturer
on hygiene, so that she is anxious for
this one reason, If not for marry others,
to resign.
President Wheeler said to-day that
pending Dr. Ritter's decision the of
fice would be temporarily filled by Dr.
Bancroft. Whether, in case Dr. Rit
ter does resign, Dr. Bancroft will re
tain the place permanently President
Wheeler was unprepared to say.
The salary that goes with this posi
tion is provided by Mrs. Phoebe" Hearst,
who will continue to give it indefi
nitely.
On account of the severity of the in
juries she received in the recent acci
dent while driving near New Almaden,
Dr. Mary B. Ritter, professor of and
lecturer on hygiene at the University
of California, is unlikely to return to
her post In the university. Her place
is being filled temporarily by Dr. El
eanor S. Bancroft in the interim that
will ensue before Dr. Ritter recovers
from her injuries, but even at the ex
piration of that period it is more than
probable that the patient will signify
her intention to withdraw altogether
from the university. She has told Pres
ident Wheeler that her wish is not to
resume her work at the university and
this is taken as being her final deci
sion, though she may change her mind
in ths end.

CHINESE DENS
ARE SHOT UP
Angelo Legoria, a scavenger, has
been convicted bv a jury in the Po
lice Court of violating the garbage or
dinance which prohibits the collect
ing and dumping of refuse within the
city limits by others than the agents
of the Pacific Incinerating Company.
Behind this conviction is the long bat
tle that has waged between the scav
engers* association and the garbage
crematory people, who hold the city
rights to handle the offal and refuse.
This is the first conviction that has
been gained by the prosecution. Many
arrests have been made, the Health
Department co-operating with the po
lice to enforce the law. Under advice
from their attorneys the scavengers
continued in business after the crema
tory began operations and persisted in
collecting garbage. But they did not
recognize the existence of the crema
tory and dumped the offensive matter
along the West Oakland marsh, as they
had done for years. This was stopped
and the scavengers found new places
of deposit on Bay Farm Island, haul
ing Oakland's refuse through Alameda.
Legoria was first tried on May 4, but
the Jury disagreed. Attorney J. H.
Creeley, representing the scavengers,
said he would on Saturday move for
a new trial and would appeal in case
his motion be denied. He purposes to
fight through to the Supreme Court.
Attorney I.. S. Church, representing
the crematory company, said his clients
were ready to carry the contest as far
as the courts would listen to it. He
declared the crematory people were
ready at all times to establish not
only the legality, but the sanitary per
fection of their methods, and he was
convinced that it is only a question of
time when the communltv would
awake to the modern plans that were
in operation.
The second trial was hard fought,
nearly three days having been con
sumed In. the impanelment of a jury.
More than one hundred talesmen were
examined. So many men . expressed a
prejudice which would bar them from
serving as fair trial jurors that Po
lice Judge Smith declared forcibly as
follows:
When men take an oath to bÂ« guided by
the law as given by the court and the evi
dence as presented. I think that any man
of ordinary intelligence la competent to perve.
These excuses are becoming very tiresome. I
should think that the majority of persons
would have more respect for their oaths than
to say they could not- welsh facts impartially,
despite their personal Ideas.

A Jury convicted W. O. Stewart of an
fcssault â¢with & deadly weapon this
â¢veningr for having shot W. S. Kennedy
In a Quarrel over the latter's wife on
the night of June 6 last on the old
Br'.pps ranch near Newark. He was
charged with assault with intent to
commit murder but was only found
guilty of the leeser offense. The max
imum punishment he can be given for
this is two years In the penitentiary.
He will be sentenced next Monday
morning.
In the courtroom at the time the Jury
returned its verdict Kennedy was walt-
Ir.g and after he had heard the verdict
eaid: "I did not care to have Stewart
punished In this way. I would like to
have licked him with my fists there
that night and would probably have
dene it if he had not stopped me with
his gun. I did not Intend to make any
complaint against him but the matter
vent so far that It got out of my
hands."
On the witness stand to-day Stewart
was asked why he went to Newark
with Kennedy and said: "Kennedy ac
cused me and his wife of being too
friendly. He would not believe me
when I said we were only acquaint
ances, so I consented to go with him
and confront her. "When we were all
together he still refused to believe me
end accused me of not carrying out my
part of the programme. He got mad
and attacked me and I shot at him
twice quickly and then turned and
valked away."
The two men had agreed that Stew
art should get an Interview with Mrs.
Kennedy and talk to her so that the
husband could hear without being seen.
Kennedy said on the stand that Stew
art talked so low that he could not
hear anything.

One of the questions of considerable
importance at the beginning of this
year was the question of Sunday open
ing in the city stores. Sunday is es
pecially the day when the peasants
i come from the outlying: towns and vll
; lages to do their shopping. The sev
! eral employes' unions and societies fa
â¢ vored shorter hours on Sundays, while
I many of the storekeepers desired to
j treat Sunday as one of their best bus
; iness days, with many customers and
! large receipts. It has finally been de
j elded and agreed that from Whitsun
tide until October 1 of each year the
stores may be open on Sundays from
11 o'clock until 3 o'clock, and that, in
j addition, the grocery and provision
! stores may open from 8 o'clock till 9
I o'clock Sunday mornings. â New York

A tall, handsome, well-dressed young
woman walked into Justice Beattie's
court at Wyandotte and demanded that i
a slander charge be issued against a \
woman neighbor.
"What are your guounds?" asked the
Justice.
"Well," replied the pretty girl, "she
said that I went walking with a gen
tleman after dark and that she had
seen him hugging me. She's a nasty
old cat."
The Justice told- the young woman
that, he couldn't see any grounds for
complaint.
"It is entirely proper that an attrac
tive young lady should have the atten
tion of a young gentleman/' exclaimed
his Honor. "This hugging stunt is an
old one and Its perfect propriety can be
attested by a number of our most
prominent citizens. It Is not abnormal,
and is dignified by centuries of prece
dent. : Neither can I see any reasonable
objection to such a performance after
nightfall. I think some little investiga
tion on your, part will satisfy you that
I am right. If your busy neighbor had
claimed, for.. Instance, that the young
gentleman had been hugging you in the
daytime, there might then '. have been
possible grounds for judicial interfer
ence." Â¦ â¢ .

A good, honest, free sweat in tor
rid weather is your life's salvation.
The man who gets boiling hot and
does not generously perspire is in dan
ger. Nature has provided 2,400,000
safety valves for the body, which we
style sweat ducts. There Is an aver
age of 3000 of these to the square Inch
in the palm of the hand. You don't
like to shake the greasy palm, eh?
You perspire fearfully in the neck,
wilting two or three collars a day, yet
there are only 417 sweat ducts to the
square inch in that part of the body,
as in the back.
"Sweat" Is regarded as less elegant
than "perspiration," but intrinsically
they are the same. The laboring man
sweats and the working woman per
spires. The lady of high social caste
"becomes moist." One of the curses
of, Adam was that he should eat
bread in the sweat of his face. We
have a common phrase â "sweating
blood." Well, that is not slang, as
many suppose. In his agony in the
garden Christ's sweat "was, as it were,
great drops of blood." The word per
spire is not in the Bible.
If the 2,400,000 pores are kept open
.there is no danger of sunstroke unless
you are very bilious. Go ahead and
sweat at least a pound and three
quarters a day and feel right. Bathe
daily, but use soap only once a week.
In the thermal baths of the world
very little soap is used after the first
hard scrubbing, as it clogs the sweat
ducts. An immersion of fifteen min
utes, followed by a thorough rubbing,
is all you need. The original princi
ple of health was to keep the feet
warm, the head cool and the alimen
tary canal well flushed. It is as good
to-day is at was in past ages. â New

relative to the strike beyond what has
been taken ani an application made
by the striking butchers for additional
aid was passed over in slinece.
A motion that the packing-house
â¢ teamsters return to work was voted
down, and it was decided to allow mat
ters to remain as they are. so far as
the teamsters are concerned-

General Manager Funk of the Inter
national Harvester Company flatly de
nies the story.
Frederick W. Job oft the Employers'
Association also denied the report. Ht>
represents all the big employers in
Chicago and has recently opened a
free employment department, where
both union and non-union men can
obtain work without discrimination.
"Some firms want union men. feel
ing that they are better disciplined,"
said Job, "and these we send to them.
Others wan* non-union men and they
get them. There is a strong demand
for labor. Manufacturing interests
look good and I do not believe there
will be any extensive shutdown."
The contests between the unions and
the packers, the trouble with machin
ists, steel workers, miners and other
divisions of the world of toll are said
to have wakened in the minds of man
ufacturers a dread of large losses to
be sustained in further strikes and
"strike breaking."
CHICAGO. Aug. 23.â Reports that a
number of the big manufacturing com
panies intend to shut down their plants
and throw thousands of men out of
work are current in financial and
other circles. The fact that the Inter
national Harvester factories in Chi
cago are closed and that the Pullman
Company has laid off more than 1000
men are cited as confirmation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. MARYS. Ohio. Aug. 23.â Before
daybreak to-day the gates at the head
of St. Marys Reservoir were blown up
by dynamite. The report of the ex
plosion was heard for miles. Build
ings were shaken and windows were
broken. Intense excitement prevails,
but every precaution has been taken
to prevent a flood. Many consider the
reservoir a menace to surrounding
farms.
If the explosion had blown out the
entire bulkhead and opened the flood
gates hundreds of lives doubtless would
have been lost. This bulkhead is tha
one through which the Miami and Erie
Canal is fed and the reservoir Is the
largest artificial body of water in the
world. Bloodhounds have been put on
the trail of the dynamiters.
There has been much ill-feeling
among the people living in the vicinity
of the reservoir, owing to the wide
spread belief that the banks of the big
body of water are not safe, notwith
standing that the State has spent large
sums of money in strengthening tha
earthworks. j _
HONOLULU. Aug. 17.â The litigation
over the great Parker ranch property
in the island of Hawaii yesterday re
sulted in some sensational affidavits
by Colonel Samuel Parker and his
counsel, which were followed to-day by
a suit for $50,000 damages for libel,
brought by Attorney W. A. KinneyJ
one of the leading members of the local
bar, against Parker, on account of
statements . contained In an affidavit
by Parker.
Parker is seeking to acquire control
of the ranch, claiming that as the sur
vivor of the partnership between him
self and the late John P. Parker, he
is entitled to manage it. The present
manager is F. W. Carter, brother of
A. W: Carter, who is guardian of Col
onel Parker's minor grandchild, heir
ess to one-half of the ranch.
Mrs. Elizabeth J. Knight of San
Francisco, mother of the minor, also
is opposing Parker's plans.
Among other charges in Parker's af
fidavit, filed in the Circuit Court, is one
that she married his son when the
latter was suffering from inflamma
tory rheumatism and a serious heart
disease and that her sole purpose was
to get hold of the property. It also
was charged that she was taking part,
either through being deceived or other
wise, in a conspiracy to wreck the for
tune. Parker alleged a conspiracy in
volving several leading law firms here,
among them being Kinney, Robertson
& Wilder, Â». M. Ballou and Assistant
United States Attorney J. J. Dunne, all
of whom are counsel for the opposing
side.
Parker's charge as to Klnne-v and
Ballou was that thev were guilty of
unprofessional Conduct in that they
had taken part in the formation of
certain agreements whereby he was
to be heavily mulcted in connection
with some of the interests involved,
but at the same time had protected
themselves. The filing of the libel suit
Immediately followed.
The Parker ranch is devoted to cat
tle raising. Outside of some of the
large suÂ«rar plantations it is the big
gest and most valuable property in the
Islands. Samuel Parker, the owner of
one-half, Is the former Republican Na
tional Committeeman for Hawaii and
has long been prominent In Island af
fairs.
N'EW YORK, Aug. 23.â The rule of
Phil YTelnseimer, the labor leader un
der indictment for extortion, was
strongly threatened to-day at a meet
cf the? Journeymen Plumbers and Gas
Fitters' Union, and the assemblage
'broke .up in confusion and a fight. One
member was thrown out and Wein
peirntr was told he was using Sam
Parks' methods to rule the union.
"Weinseimer, who is one of the business
agents of the union, presided at the
meeting. He censured some of the men
for returning to work on a certain
building which figures in the case
against, him. He said he knew that
<om< of the men were working there,
o the contractors having Induced them
.to do so. At this a member, said to
l>e the boss plumber on the building,
ciore and shouted at Wemseimer:
'Â¦We are sick and tired of things you
aie doing. We are just about ieady
Viot to star.d any more of It. We've no
use for these pernicious tactics."
Weinseimer made a heated reply,
criticizing the man severely. He called
on the union to put the boss plumber
-out, which was done. The man, how
ever, collected a number of his friends
and returned to the hall. He again
shouted at Weinseimer: "We will have
no more of this Parks business from
you. If you want to run the union into
the ground, go ahead and do it. We
will get out."
Immediately there was a fight, blows
were struck and men on both 6ides
were roughly handled. The boss
plumber, with a number of his follow
ers, rnembcrr of the union, left the hd.ll
and went to the building, where they
started work again.
JACKSON, Mich.. Aug. 23.â An
anomaly among convicts has been
brought to light In the case of J. M.
Leonard, a university graduate and
once a county attorney, who has been
serving an indeterminate sentence for
burglary at the State Prison. Leonard
has prepared his own papers of appeal
to the United States Circuit Court to
release him from confinement under
the provisions of the indeterminate
sentence law.
Leonard was sent to Jackson In 1S94
for ten to fifteen year3. Since that
time a new State law has been enacted
providing that in all cases where of
fenses are committed prior to the pas
sage of the new law the minimum sen-^
tence was valid. Leonard claims that
in his case the operation of the law
was retroactive and that his sentence
is therefore wholly void.
The papers in the case, presented on
a writ of certiorari, will be in the hands
of the proper officials to-day. Upon
the decision will depend the imprison
ment of many other prisoners in addi
tion to those released under the deci
sion of the State Supreme Court.
Blanks have been sent out to exhi
bitors by the international jury that
have caused much consternation
among some of the Californians. These
contain a list of the questions concern
ing articles to be entered that it is
Impossible to answer here as far as
they apply to some manufactured ar
ticles, such . as oils and wines. The
blanks must be filled out and returned
by September 1. They were given to
the exhibitors on August IS. Many of
the aueries relate to matters that only
the growers and manufacturers are
cognizant of. Manv statistics are de
manded that have no weight as in
formation to Intending: settlers and are
consequently not on file here. A num
ber of these blanks have been sent to
California by the State Commission
and the county representatives and
must there be filled out and then re
turned to St. Louis.
Only as regards apples does Califor
nia seem to have much of a horticul
tural fight on her hands. The field of
tables bearing apples from the various
States in the Horticultural building
make California's exhibit In that
State's white and gold facade look lim
ited, but there are some fine apples
in the California display and such
States as Arkansas, Idaho, New York
and others that have claimed suprem
acy in the production of this fruit
may find some of their laurels wrested
from them when the judges have pass
ed on the merits of the "Watsonville,
Los Angeles, Placerville. Redlands,
Santa Cruz and San Bernardino ap
ples.
The fresh fruits that have been ar
riving from California have been under
the eyes of the judges during the time
they lasted. Each new lot is carefully
inspected.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS,
Aug. 23. â The days of awards, the most
trying of the fair, are near at hand and
California is putting forth all her
strength in the race for medals and
premiums. The State and the County
Commissioners hope for many honors
and feel that many must come their
way. The judging of some products
which California makes a special boast
of will be finished by the first of Sep
tember and some announcements will
probably be made by September 10.
There is not an exhibitor from Cali
fornia, individual, county or State, that
does not feel certain of a prize. Com
parison with the exhibits of other
States and nations is giving confidence.
The State Commission is going to put
the exhibit made by the counties of
California in the Palace of Agriculture
in competition with the world for a
grand or sweepstake prize. This ex
hibit, which has cost the counties of
the State $200,000, the' money being pro
vided by public bodies and Supervisors,
is claimed by the County Commission
ers to be the most comprehensive and
beautiful display of the products of the
soil, oil, wines and honey made by any
State or nation represented at the ex
position.
All the counties hope for medals of
some sort and olive oils and wines are
expected to bring many premiums.
Santa. Clara County will enter its "Pal
ace of Prunes," which is really cov
ered with all sorts of fruits, as a dried
fruit exhibit.

"My wife's brother left Yokohama
some fifteen years ago. His name is
James Davis. He was reported ship
wrecked about two years ago. He has
not written to his sister, my wife, for
fifteen years and naturally she is anx

friend who came over from Honolulu
suggested that it might be the easiest
way of getting in touch with him by
writing to some one in Honolulu, as
ho was known there by at least some
of the shipping people, â¢ having been
an engineer on board some steamer
from Honolulu.
"This friend met him here In Yoko

THROUGH the many expressions of President
Roosevelt runs a hearty note of appreciation for
the homely and simple features of .life as found in
the country and on the farm. He said to the rugged peo
ple of Maine in 1902: "The man on the farm, more than
any of our citizens to-day, is called upon continually to
exercise the qualities which we like to think of as typi
cal of the United States throughout its history â the qual
ities of rugged independence, masterful resolution and
individual energy and resourcefulness. He works hard,
for which no man is to be pitied, and often he lives hard,
which may not be pleasant, but his life is passed in
healthy surroundings, which tend to develop a fine type
of citizenship. In the country, moreover, the conditions
are such as to allow a closer touch between man and
man than too often we find the case in the city. Men
feel more vividly the underlying sense of brotherhood
and community of interest."
And again: "The man who tills his own farm, whether
on the prairies or in the woodland, the man who grows
what we eat and the raw material of what we wear, still
exists more nearly under the conditions which obtained
when 'the embattled farmers' of 1776 made this country
a nation than is true of any others of our people* In a
country like ours it is fundamentally true that the well
being of the tiller of the soil and of the wage-worker
is the well-being of the state."
Roosevelt's vital touch with things is always respon
sive to a contact with the natural conditions that char
acterize life on the farm. In an allied vocation he re
sorted to the wilderness to rid himself of the serious
handicap of a frail physique, and emerged from that rug
ged experience physically a type of the American man,
firm, broad-shouldered, deep-chested and with endurance
equal to the performance of the hardest tasks. His con
tacts with the people have inspired his philosophy, ex
pressed in this: "An American who is to make his way
in America should be brought up among hi;; fellow
Americans." That is true, for what can- be expected of
a man, expatrir^ed inhis childhood, educated and reared
abroad, with no knowledge of his country and; his coun-

Here is a story from London that
rivals the yarn about precious metal
in chickens' crops:
"An East End doctor has made a
remarkable discovery. A . few days
ago he was In the house of a friend at
Bethnal Green when he picked Aip the
jawbone of a sheep, noticing a dull
gleam of a bronze color on the teeth.
'Why, that looks like gold,' he said,
after examining the teeth closely. The
doctor removed the teeth, took them
to his surgery and tested the deposit
or coating on the teeth with aquafor
tis. That gave the result as pure gold.
Xext the teeth were taken to a Jewel
er, who scraped off the metal and
submitted It to all tests known.. The
substance was then guaranteed to be
pure, fine gold.
"Other sheeps' heads were pur
chased at random from Bethnal
Green purveyors and some of them
exhibited traces of gold deposit on
the teeth in just the same way. They
had all arrived from the Antipodes.
English and Scotch sheeps' heads
were obtained, but there was no trace
of any auriferous deposit. The in
ference is that somewhere on the vast
grazing plains of Australia or New
Zealand farmers are feeding their
flocks of sheep on pasture so aurifer
ous that the very animals show traces
of the outcrop of gold in their teeth."

Ever since the Boer war, and espe
cially during the campaign to author
ize Chinese labor, the Transvaal mines
have been "talking poor." The recent
sharp declines in South African mine
shares at London has been partly a
consequence of this attitude. Yet a
suspicion of humbug has surrounded
the whole affair, and many unbiased
people have suspected that the mine
owners' plea cf distress was merely a
maneuver to make sure of permission
to use what is virtually slave labor.
The 'following remark, on the present
earnings of the mines, is from the
London Financial Times, which is
Itself an advocate of Chinese labor:
The rate of profit has, of course,
been kept down by the labor insuffi
ciency, but that there has been re
cently some improvement in this re
spect has been demonstrated by the
dividend declarations made within the
past month or so. Of these Interim
distributions on account of the current
year over 40 per cent are at an In
creased rate as compared with the cor
responding period of 1903, and the total
sum Involved Is over two millions" sterl
ing, so that " the anticipated total for
the year of from Â£4,500,000 to Â£5.000.

the latter sum be attained 1904 will

The colony of Guatemalan ants which
Professor Cook, botanist of the United
States Department of Agriculture, took
to the Government experiment station
at Victoria. Tex., is bemg watched with
absorbing interest by the experimen
ters. Texas is waiting for f progeny
of that little band of 5000 to march
forth into the cotton fields and lift the
boll-weevil quarantine that is shutting
many of her products out of other
Southern States. . So far as the experi
ments have gone, they seem to be en
couraging. A number of facts con
cerning the appearance of the ants,
their habits and their hardiness have
been observed and their wide publica
tion throughout the South indicates the
seriousness of the search for an effec
tive weevil parasite. It is regarded
as encouraging, for example, that only
twelve of the colony of 5000 died on the
way from Guatemala to Texas, while
many more than twelve were hatched.
It has been settled that the ants are
not herbaceous, therefore the cotton
plants are safe from them. The ex
perimenters confess, with some reluc
tance, that the parasites do not hunt
the weevil; if the cotton pests get in
their way, however, as they climb ac
tively about the stalks, the ants have
an effective way of killing them. Were
it not for the handicap of shortsighted
ness (its field of vision being limited
to about an Inch) the ant would be
likely to accomplish what paris green
and epecial cultivation have as yet
failed to do.

THE prolific Petaluma hen â that conscientious
worker for the cause of humanity â comes in for a
goodly meed of praise in the August number of the
California Promotion Committee's publication, "For. Cal
ifornia." Not only is high honor paid to "her unselfish
devotion to the duty of keeping ever warm the nest egg,
but her merits as a money-getter and a harbinger
of prosperity are displayed with zealous care. In
deed, with this faithful bird, as yet unalterably partisan
to the principle of the open shop, we need fear no meat
strikes or packing-house walkouts, according to the
word of her enthusiastic panegyrists.
H. O. Woodworth, in an article on the practical value
of poultry raising in California, states that a conserva
tive estimate places an annual profit of $1.25 upon each
hen. Out here on the coast, where climatic conditions
ate so favorable and the expenses of providing substan
tial shelters for poultry are consequently eliminated, the
cost involved in the raising of chickens on an extensive
scale is at a minimum and a higher ratio of profit is in
sured the raiser than in any portion of the East. It has
come about, therefore, that we now may count poultry
raising as one of the sound industries of the State and
one yet to be developed beyond its already profitable
status.
As emphasized in the many articles^of this poultry
number, the raising of chickens both for market and
for the egg supply is a venture which any one with small
capital can make and with almost certain hopes of suc
cess. It takes no great outlay to embark in the poultry
business â a broad field, a little fencing, some sacks of
food, and the trick is done. From a hundred fowls on
an acre of ground there should come a first year's in
crease that covers all initial expenses and leaves a mar
gin of profit besides; for the hen, we are assured, flour
isheth as the green bay tree if given only half a
chance.
Place is rightly given in the Promotion Committee's
publication for a notice of what is being done by the
State poultry station at Petaluma. This institution, au
thorized by the last Legislature, has already done much
for poultry iaisÂ«rs in the line of experiment and prac
tical demonstration of scientific methods. Through bul
letins the results of investigation into diseases of fowls
have been published and co-operative experiments car
ried en through the station's agency have been of im
mense value to all interested in poultry culture. Thus it
is that this new and rapidly rising industry has its foun
dation upon scientific principles and develops along the
rational lines of scientific method.
THE DAY OF THE HEN.
A* passenger on a Guerrero street car
recently had an opportunity to study,
unobserved, the struggle between con
science and cupidity In a little ten
year-old sirl. The conductor failed to
collect her fare immediately after she
entered the car. She had the required
nickel in her hand and she watched
him furtively for a time to note
whether he would overlook her en
tirely.
She was apparently in a quandary
what to do and then conscience com
menced to perform its subtle functions.
Several times she held out her hand in
a hesitating manner. Meanwhile the
nickel was carefully concealed between
her fingers from the view of the con
ductor. After making this abortive
pretense of paying several times con
science was triumphant and the next
time the conductor passed she held out
the fare boldly and there was no mis
taking her Intention.
There was a satisfied look on her
chubby face when the fare was reg
istered, but it is doubtful if she real
ized how great a victory she had won
and what an influence that simple in
cident might have in shaping her char
acter.

Two facts Immediately impress thÂ»
student of the fiscal year's showing of
gold exports and Imports â the magni
tude of the total movement, and the
fact that, despite the unprecedented
540,000,000 lump-sum remittance to
France, gold imports exceeded exports.
As for the first point, gold exports and
imports combined foot up $180,567,000
for the twelvemonth past, whereas
1903 gave only $94,072,000, and the
highest previous record was $145,934.
000. in the fiscal year 1896. That
period, too, was a time of gold ship
ments under special contract, the Bel
mont-Morgan syndicate having under
taken to deliver $65,000,000 gold to
the Treasury, "one-half of which shall
be obtained in and shipped from
Europe."
The equally striking fact is. that de
spite the $60,000,000 gold shipment oC
April and May to Paris, and the $21.
000,000 earlier exportatlons. Imports
for the twelvemonth exceeded exports.
This rather remarkable result was
brought about: During that period,
Japan has sent us something like $35.
000,000 gold, largely in transit. From
the Klondike we have drawn $20,000,
000. from* Mexico $10,000,000 and
from Australia $7,000,000; these were

Lewis Waller begins operations at the
Imperial, Mrs. Langtry's theater â
which he has made to pay thus farâ
with a revival of "Miss Elizabeth's
Prisoner." This play of the Revolu
tion seems to have been a comparative
failure at home, but Waller has found
5t a money maker. GeoTge Alexander's
appearance in "The Garden of Lies"
will occur a few evenings later, to be
followed closely by the production of
Henry Arthur Jones' new play at the
Garrick. Later in the season new
pieces are promised by both Pinero and
liarrie and there is considerable curio
city regarding both. Of the announce
ments made for the coming season,
however, by all odds the most attrac

Mr. Frohman guarantees that there
v.ill be no mistake about it this time
and that the erstwhile "Lady Babble"

gether, the general attitude toward
American entertainments on this side
of the water is much more favorable
than it was some time ago. The fail
ure of "The Climbers," "Dolly Varden"
and "Cynthia"â not to mention several
plays like "The Sword of the King,"
which were said to have scored heavily
across the water, left a dubious im
pression In the minds of playgoers
here. "The Darling of the Gods." how
ever, was one* of the few emphatic suc
cesses of the winter, and "The Prince
of Pilsen," with a hundred nights al
ready to its credit and, seemingly,
many more to follow, has helped to re
etore the prestige of American "shows."
Incidentally, it is chiefly due to the
popularity of certain American spe
cialities that London has had any the
atrical entertainment at all during the
dog-days. With the beginning of the
warm weather all but seven plays died
a Epeedy death, one of these seven be
ing the luminously popular "Duke of
Kllliecrankie" and the other six musi

Prince of Pilsen," It is not too much
to say that "The Earl and the Girl"
would have expired long ago were it
not for the drawing powers of
"Sammy," "In Zanzibar," "My Cozy
corner Girl" and the other interpolated
American songs, and "Bedelia" has
from the first been one of the strong
est features of "The Orchid." The
other two survivors are "Veronique"

for reform ii^our system of taxation has attracted
general attention. We are in receipt of many let
ters with suggestions of features that might be included
in the proposed new system. As we understand the
Grange plan, it does not propose to exclude personalty
from taxation, but merely to provide support for the
State government by devoting thereto the revenue de
rived from corporations and State franchises and excise.
The corporations and franchises and licenses taxed for
State purposes are to be relieved from local taxation,
arid the support of local government is to be derived
from tax on realty and personalty. The plan has the
advantage of simplicity and economy, and is already
justified by its success in older. States, where it has
'long been in approved operation.
This leaves the realty and personalty to be dealt with
in such a way as to more nearly equalize the burdens
of city and country realty, and also to get a more nearly
just assessment of personal property. The people of
Alameda County have the question of local taxation un
der consideration, and are discussing it in joint meet
ings of improvement clubs and other civic associations.
We have to suggest that they direct their discussion to
the plans of the State Grange, to the end that a commu
nity of effort be secured with that organization and the
city and country representatives in the Legislature may
be brought together in a joint endeavor to do something.
California has long gone on under awkward and ex
pensive methods of government, because the people have
become accustomed to the imperfections under which
they groan. But now we are enlarging into a greater
California, with a rapidly increasing population and a
vast multiplication of interests, and the imperfections in
government will touch and affect a greater number of
people, and if they impede development, will be> a bar
to far more interests. Therefore, wherever the machin
ery can be eased in its operations it is wisdom to apply
the remedy.
Ingenious application of the law can reach seques
tered personalty. There are those who promise to end
the difficulties presented by that sequestration by taking
all tax off personalty and putting it upon realty. But
this is justly opposed by the owners of realty, since it
is sure that whenever any class of property is exempted
from taxation there will be an immediate tendency to
put property in the untaxed form whereit has to bejjro
tected by the law but will pay nothing for its protec
tion.
One suggestion comes to us affecting the assessment
of personalty, which may deserve the attention of the
experts who are discussing the question. The proposi
tion is to lay a surphis wealth tax. The surplus wealth
of a man is that which he owns over and above his
debts. We have that system applied to realty by means
of the mortgage tax. That tax was provided for an en
tirely different purpose than that effected by its opera
tion. It was supposed that it would be a means of
reaching and assessing moneys and credits. But if turns
out to be the means of preventing double assessment of
property. The owner of a mortage records it, and
thereafter sequestration of the personal estate in the
mortgage becomes impossible. Therefore, to tax the
mortgage to its Â»full value and to tax the land on which
it is imposed its full value would be double taxation.
So the owner of the mortgaged realty pays only on the
surplus value of his land, over and above the amount of
the mortgage, the tax on the mortgage being paid by
its owner. This is merely a tax on the surplus wealth
in land.
Applying it to personalty, the owner of $1000 worth
of personal property, on which he owes $800, would pay
a tax on $200, representing his surplus wealth in that
amount of personalty. The man to whom he owes the
$800 has that as an asset, properly assessable and tax
able as personalty, under the head of moneys and cred
its. This seems, upon such examination as we have been
able to give it, to be the extension to personal property
of the principle of the mortgage tax. It will not only
avoid double taxation qi the same personalty, but will
be a means of increasing the assessment of personalty.
The man who owes the debt, as* a book account, will
be very 'willing to confine his own assessment to his
surplus wealth, and to do so must disclose his creditor.
In this way all such personal assets as book accounts
and commercial credits, outstanding on the day fixed
for, assessment of property, will be taxed to those who
extend the credit, and the surplus value of the property
will be taxed to those who receive the credit. The sug
gestion is a good one to discuss among the features of
the proposed reform. It will put the assessment of cred
its where it belongs, and ought to add largely to the
assessable personalty of the State.
The State Grange can get wider public attention to
the general issue it haÂ£ raised by arranging meetings in
the cities, to which its officers and members of its com
mittee on taxation can communicate "its views. This will
bring about an understanding between property-owners
in the cities and the country, and will greatly advance
the cause which the Grange has made its own.
It Is unnecessary to recapitulate the
achievements of several of the French
boaÂ«s, _s they have been publicly re
poricu .rom time to time. They not
only iihicate that these little vessels
have a practical value, but that the
requisite nerve for their employment is
possessed in a high degree by the
French officers who have been placed
in charjje of them. Interesting tests
were also csade in February last by
two submarines, or, more accurately,
submersibles. It was arranged that
they should make an attack on two
French liners in the vicinity of the
port, the Espadon looking out for the
Bretagne on its way from Havre to
NcW Tork and the Silure tackling the
Champagne on her voyage from the
United States. The former managed, to
come within 200 yards of the Bretagne
without being observed by the men on
board who were directed to keep a
sharp lookout, and the Silure put In an
appearance, also unobserved, until her
officer hailed the lookout men on com
ing to the surface, right between the
two liners when they were within sig
naling distance of each other and the
presumption is that she could have at
tacked both without being seen.
Whatever may be said against the
rubmarines, the French people accept
the evidence of the repeated trials as a
complete vindication of the large ex
penditure which has already been
sanctioned on the submarines, fifty
eicU in all. which are built, building or
projected. In the activity of th Brit
ish Admiralty may be seen further evi
dence that, in the opinion of the Eng
lish authorities, the submarine has
come and that it behooves them to
hasten to catch up with their near
rivals. The unfortunate fact in the
situation from the British point of view
is that British supremacy is based on
a superiority of large ships, battleships
and cruisers, which thefee small ships
are intended to attack, and science has
not yet evolved any effective defense
against the most insidious weapon ever
fashioned by the hand of man. The
British authorities are concentrating
their efforts on the development of the
submarine torpedo-boat. They believe
that the large type now building is a
powerful addition to the defensive
weapons of the fleet, able to cruise
alone in the open sea or to accompany
a fighting force. On both sides of the
English Channel these menacing craft
are already being marshaled in large
numbers, and it can no longer be de
nied that the submarine has come to
stay.â Archibald S. Hurd, in Forum.

duties of his candidacy. He had been absorbed in
money-making for many years. Outside of West Vir
ginia there were not a thousand Democrats in the coun
try who could remember that they had ever heard of
him before his nomination. He was not conspicuous
while in public life and certainly had greater talent as
a money maker than a statesman. His nomination had
not been discussed in advance. He was unknown to the
party. His affiliations had long been with his partner
Rockefeller, J. Pierpont Morgan and that circle of high
financiers who have been exploiting the coal, iron and
oil interests of West Virginia, using him as the local
promoter.
He had had no contact nor sympathy with the Demo
cratic rank and file and -had dwelt far apart from them
for many years. His age, added to the fact of his long
withdrawal from everything and all interests except the
increasing qi his immense fortune, made his nomination
a thing important because it had no natural justification.
Now the party is disillusioned by the demonstration that
he shows every year of his great age and is already in a
condition of physical decadence.
There is left one solace for the mourning Democracy,
however. The old gentleman's purse is a yearling, with
all the energy of youth. If that doesn't dodder it is all
right, and its owner's age will be no bar to his candi
dacy.

Chief of Police Wittman yesterday
appeared before Judge Cabaniss as
complaining witness against .E. W.
Darling, alias "The Nature Man," ac
cused of circulating obscene literature.
Mr. Darling's costume was as scant
as decency would â¢ permit, even
at a seaside bathing resort. His
nether limbs were bare below the
knees, his arms and a wide expanse
of chest were also nude, and his head
covering consisted of a thick tangle of
tawny hair that flicked his brawny
shoulders and mingled with the stray
threads of a luxuriant, snuff-colored
beard. A shirt and a bifurcated gar
ment, both of light material, comprised
his attire.
As material evidence against the de
fendant there was produced In court
a Email printed card captioned with a
vignette of himself and containing ten
phonetically spelled health hints, one of
which was of a character said to be
unfit for distribution in a respectable j
community. It was charged that "The I
Nature Man" sold the cards on the
streets for five cents apiece, thereby
vlolating section 311, Penal Code of
California.
Chief Wittman said that he would
like to have Mr. Darling retired from
circulation during the forthcoming visit
of the Knights Templar, as the city"s
dignity could not possibly be enhanced
by having strangers from afar see a
semi-naked man parading its high
ways. Such a sight might tend to
! make them believe that California is
as wild and woolly as imaginative
Eastern writers sometimes make it out
to be. After gazing upon "The Nature
Man," the Chief thought, the visiting
Knights would be looking for his
jungle on Market street and arming
themselves in anticipation of an attack
by Indians on Kearny street or a buf
j falo stampede on Van Ness avetiue.
Mr. Darling pleaded his own defense
j and his language was quite
i temperate, and in . other respects
! at variance with his personal
| appearance. He was a graduate
j of Stanford University, he said,
; who had discovered by actual experi
' ment that human health and spirits
i could be best preserved by remmnclng
I the sartorial and dietary conventions
! of modern society and living as primi
| tive man Uvedâ close to nature. Rule
i No. 2 of nis health hints showed the
j way to do this:
"Gradualy tufen ur body & mind by
! wotr & sun-bath til u kan safeiy sleep
J outdorz in ordinary wether. Liv alwaz
'< in pure, out-dor air."
As for breaking the law by peddling
! his cards, Mr. Darling disclaimed In
j tent to do that. His literature was dis
tributed for the benefit of folk who de
sired to live long and. die deeply re
gretted. The rule of which complaint
j was made he considered the most Im-
J portant of the series, and if he were
' not allowed to promulgate It he would
| have no desire to remain In San Fran
cisco, as its suppression would be the
city's lors, not his. -he rule enjoined
| a somewhat continent life and opposed
! a life of lust, following the lines of
t modern tokological writers.
The case was^ continued till Septem
ber 6, the defendant being allowed to
go on his own recognizance. If he falls
to reappear on the aforementioned date
and it has been ascertained that he left
the city, no effort will be made to have
him brought back.

Judge Conlan heard all the testi
mony for the prosecution of Benjamin
F. Germain, accused of bigamy, and set
next Friday as the date for hearing
the defense.
Two women testified that they had
been led to the altar by the defendant,
and before and after testifying they
sat side by side and chatted amiably
and in undertone. Germain did not ex
hibit much concern as his alleged
bigamous conduct was being recounted.
Mrs. E. H. Germain, middle-aged,
tastefully gowned in blue, told of her
marriage to the defendant on January
2. 1903. at Oregon City, Or., by the
Rev. P. K. Hammond, who also ap
peared in court and identified Germain
as the groom of that occasion. He
could not be mistaken because Oregon
City is a small place and marriage
there is not an everyday occurrence.
Documentary evidence in the shape
of a small book bound in white and
gold was introduced. The book, in
addition to containing a duly certified
record of the wedding, was filled with
neatly printed marital axioms, one of
which was to the effect that true con
tentment means pure happiness. The
hook was identified by Mr. Hammond
Â«s the one he had presented to the
bride.
Mrs. Virginia H. Harper then told
of her marriage to Germain last Sep
tember in this city. She had a res
taurant in Santa Barbara and the de
fendant was her cook when he won
her affections, which he never would
have won if she had known he had a
legal wife then living.
Germain's defense will probably be
that he thought the Oregon City lady
had obtained a divorce from him
when he married the Santa Barbara
lady.
Jake Emige's feelings toward Miss
Etta Raymond of/448 Linden avenue
have evidently undergone radical mu

disturbing the peace. Then he was

wrote to Judge Conlan a letter that
reflected pitiless animosity toward the
author of his incarceration. Here is

Patrick Ryan, the clerk in the Hiber
nla Bank, yesterday answered the suit
for divorce begun by his wife, Maud.
He denied all of her allegations of
cruelty, denied his alleged exhibition
of temper on the return trip from their
Shasta outing and denied that he had
not provided a wardrobe for their ex
pected child until the eleventh hour.
In this matter he explained that he
gave his wife a cash allowance and
that she had an account at one of the
dry goods stores and could have pro
vided for the infant herself, as he ex
pected her to do.
She charged in her complaint that he
arranged a celebration for the chris
tening of the babe without consulting
her. He denies this and says that he
consulted her and the arrangements
were satisfactory. The christening was
hastened, he says, because he wanted
his brother, a- Catholic* clergyman, to
perform the ceremony and the brother
was about to depart for Europe. Ryan
also says that the mother and brother
of his wife lived at their home and
made themselves obnoxious by their
offlciousness in household affairs. He
declares that on several occasions after
i the acts complained of in her suit they
were separated and made up again.

No, it was not; in fact, it was a
cheese that could be introduced with
impunity to the most fastidious pal
ate.
"Three montfis for you," said his
Honor to the defendant.
Silvio Garcia stole a large and
heavy cheese from a grocery at
Broadway and Stockton street and
trundled it along the sidewalk to a
restaurant on Montgomery avenue,
where he was trying to sell it for
much less than its value when his ar
rest stopped the negotiation.
"What kind of a cheese was it?"
Judge Conlan asked the policeman.
The officer did not know its quality,
but the grocer furnished the desired
information, stating it was an ordin
ary dairy cheese and in excellent
health.

WHAT PIANO
Â¦ SHOULD YOU BUY?
You know something about pianos; you know
some or all of the makes which we sell; but if you
didn't then the fifty-four years of age and general
standing of our company would be worth as much to^
you as knowledge of the instrument.
Did You Ever Stop to Think What Purchasing
Power There Is in the Plain, Simple Truth?
We don't want to make our friends (?) feel badly, but since it's the troth, we
don't mind telling you that we sold eight pianos on Monday and six selections were \
made vesterday. " w
l /3 TO J4 LESS THAN REGULAR PRICES
Is the greatest panacea for Blue Monday we ever found. Selections are
now offered from new pianos as well as used pianos â the largest stock In
San Francisco â almost any style and wood you wish, and prices which Jus-
tify a much earlier purchase than may have been contemplated.^ The time to
buy is when you can buy cheap â that time is now. Select your piano bow.
If not in every way as represented you have the privilege of exchange. We
know what our pianos are. we know theyN are time-tried and proven, and
we are willing to guarantee them against any delect In workmanship or
material.

The Season's Practice Will Begin on
the University Campus on Mon-'.
day Afternoon.
BERKELEY, Aug. 23.â The foot
ball season for 1904 at the University
of California was opened to-day with
a rally in North Hall. Coach James
Hopper, Trainer Walter Christy, Col
onel George C. Edwards, Graduate
Manager Ezra Decoto and some vet
eran players and young ones also met
to discuss the situation.
The keynote of every speech was
that California is going to have an up
hill fight this year to win the inter
collegiate game. Last year California
had all the veterans and Stanford few.
This year it is the other way, so the
speakers were insistent to impress the
aspiring talent that it is well to work
hard if it would win.
Practice will begin on Monday
afternoon and in anticipation of the
first rough and tumble suits are to be
distributed to-morrow. In order to
guard against accidents candidates for
tho elevens will be given strength tests
bj the coach and trainer on Thursday.
This is a new feature of California
football and is copied from the East,
where it is considered an imperative
preresquisite for football training

PORTLAND, Aug. 23. â The home
team went right after the Commuters
t^o-day. They were aided by Roach's
pitching and by Oakland's failure to
make use of her opportunities. The
score of 4 to 0 was largely due to the
Portland's good playing. Francksmade

Even the three-legged cow at Idora
Park, Oakland, laughed at the Seals
yesterday, as it chewed the paint from
a $3 88 Moorish column. The great
American game has been burlesqued in
every burg from Oshkosh to Timbuc
too, but it was never made such a
shame for the neighbors as was made
of it by Harris' mummies.
Knell got his in the second inning.
Whalen came to the rescue, but hur
ried to the woods after being bumped
for eight. It was not human warfare,
it was slaughter.
Then the. Seals tried Hans Anderson,
of the wooden shoes, in the box. It got
to be a nightmare. Hildebrand twirled
through the last four rounds of agony.
It looked like a combination of golf,
cricket and paresis. Only one person
refused to laugh, a wanderer from
Milpitas. "I promised the folks not to
get buncoed," he said, "but here I am."
After that awful second spasm an
Oakland fan of the gentler sex, who
couldn't be kept out of a game by a
Sheriff's posse, said to her escort:
"Clarence, let's ride the scenic railway
t<j kill time before this kills us."
The language used by the everyday,
tobacco-chewing, peanut-eating fan
was warm enough to melt pigiron.
Some one suggested that a subscription
be taken up to bury the San Francisco
team, with the exception of Pat Meany.
"Bury nothing," shouted one of the
Old Guard, "have them cremated. Don't
take any chances."
But let us drop the curtain on this
harrowing scene. In the words of that
famous poet, Luke McLuke, it was the
end of the limit.
Until midnight an individual with a
clay pipe in a No. 9 mouth lingered
outside the grounds with a piece of
scantling in his fist. "Wait till that
wooden-shoe man Anderson comes out,"
he muttered. "The gall av him. To
think that he should be put in to re
lieve Whalen whose father came from
the same county as me own. Glory be,
the Swedes will be in politics next."
Following is the shamefulness in full:

j SACRAMENTO, Aug. 23.âNotwith
standing Sacramento is once again a
I wide open town, with gambling gamp <
I of all kinds running in full blast, there
was a light attendance to-day at th-*
State Fair races. It had been argue*!
by those in favor of gambling during
| the fair that if the restrictions of thÂ»
j law were not enforced by the authnri
1 ties large crowds would be brought t'>
I the city and the attendance at the races
increased many fold. Nothing of th*
sort occurred to-day and the poolseller*
shouted themselves hoarse in a vain
endeavor to stimulate the betting.
Early in the afternoon rain fell light
ly. The precipitation Increased stead
ily and the last two races were run in
a downpour. The only incident to en
liven an ordinary card was the struss!^
between Dr. W and Cavalier for the
long end of the J500 purse In the open
ing race, a r>ace for green horses. Cav
alier covered a mile in 2:12i4, the fast
est of the meeting. Dr. W opened a H
to 10 favorite, but after Cavalier hai
taken the second heat in impressive
style, the betting switched and the lat
ter became a 4 to 10 favorite over the
field. Durfee distinguished himself Â»Â»y
his superior handling of the brown sun
of Welcome. In the final heat Leggct
crowded Durfee on the turn, causing
Cavalier to break. He was beaten a
neck at the wire. Durfee protested
the heat.
In the second race Nance O'Neil made
her field look like common roadsters,
winning in straights. The race was
without interest.
In the third race Sir Preston and
Innsbruck were equal choices at $20
each, with the field at J6. To a good
start Sir Preston made the running and
won by a couple of lengths. Innsbruck
beating Idalum for the place in a hard
drive.
The fourth race went to Aunt Polly,
at $20 to $17 for the field. She won in a
gallop, a length separating Miss Culver
and Samar for the place. Dr. Shorb
Â¦was expected to win, the final race at
six furlongs, but was beaten in a drive
with Our Pride, a fielder, Romaine get
ting the show. Summary:

Sensational Speed Trials
Champion Jeffries is flattered but not
pleased at the overwhelming favorite
bis friends have made him in the bet
ting on the championship fight. He
expected to ffet some money on himself
at one to two, but the market is flooded
with the money of his admirers. It Is
going bogging at one to three and a
half, with the prospects of a still larger
price before fhe biff fellows enter the
rins on Friday night. The betting Is
even money that Jeffries will win in-
Eide ten rounds.
The outsider in the betting on a prize
fipht always has a following, but it is
not possible to absorb all the Jeffries
money in sight.
There v. ill be an important fight con
ference at S o'clock to-night at Harry
Ocrbett's. Rereree Graney will meet
Killy Delaney*. representing Jeffries,
end Kid McC&y and Harry Pollok, the
representatives of Munroe. They will
discuss the matter of bandages and the
rules under which the heavyweights
Will fight.
In order that the Eastern papers may
pel the Ftory of the championship into
their first editions Manager Coffroth
has arranged to have the men in the
ring at S o'clock. The conference to
night will do away with the customary
Â¦wrangle in the ring, thus saving con
siderable time. The spectators are as-*
pured of being home at a reasonable
hour even if the fight should go the
limit.
For the last time until he faces Jack
Munroe Jeffries donned the gloves yes
terday. He boxed eight fast rounds
with Joe Kennedy and Brother Jack.
The champion will do no more boxing,
as he does not intend to take any
chance of injuring his hands. For the
same reason he will cut out bag punch
ing and will confine himself to road
work, rowing, shadow boxing and work
with the apparatus in the gymnasium.
JEFFRIES A HARD WORKER.
Jeff arose about 7 o'clock yesterday
and shortly after breakfast repaired
to the Reliance Club to begin the last
hard day's work of his training. Â¦ A
crowd was on hand, as the report had
gone out that the big fellow would
surely don the gloves. A number of
well known sporting men from this
city journeyed across the bay to see
the champion in action. They were
not disappointed, for they saw eight
rounds of such milling as is seldom
witnessed in training.
The burly champion opened the pro
gramme with a short period of rope
ekipping and then, taking a pair of
light dumbbells, he worked at shadow
boxing for nearly half an hour. At
the close of this lighter exercise he
called for the gloves and at last the
spectators knew they would see some
boxing. Joe Kennedy faced the cham
pion for the first round. After a min
ute's rest at the close of the round.
Brother Jack came up to take his share
of the medicine. Thus while Jeffries
boxed the regular three-minute rounds
with but a minute rest at the end of
each, both his sparring partners re
ceived a full four minutes' rest. They
needed it. Although it was plain to
every one that the big fellow was not
letting himself out. yet time and time
again his brother and Joe Kennedy
â¢uere sent reeling back from short-arm
Jolts delivered at close range. Once
during a hot mixup. Brother Jack ran
against a hard uppercut and was sent
â¢ flat on his back on the floor.
MUXROES LAST BOXING.
"When Eugene Van Court called time
et the end of the eighth round both
of the champion's trainers were in
need of a rest,. while Jeff danced around
as if he was Just beginning to warm up.
Â« There is not a doubt that on Friday
â¢ night the big fellow will be as he says:
"Fit to put up the fight of my life."
A bath and rubdovvn concluded the
morning's work and for a couple of
hours after dinner the champion loafed.
In the afternoon he ran around Lake
and ended the day with an
|kour's rowing.
Munroe did his last boxing yester
day, morning at 11 o'clock. He went
four rounds with Kid McCoy and three
each with Chester and Foley. The
founds were all sharp engagements,
bard blows being given and taken by
the boxers.
A five-mile Jaunt on the park roads
will probably be the extent of Mun
roe's work to-day as' he wants to build
up his store of vitality. He is trained
to the hour and expresses confidence
in his powers.

CHICAGO, Aug. 23.â S. W. Street &
Co., who, handle the western division
of James R. Keene's stable, placed an
other victory to the credit of the firm
in the third race to-day at Hawthorne
when Robin Hood, a son of Kingston-
Belle of Maywbod, led all the way. So
many good things have been put over
by the Street stable of late that the
ring would not take any chances with
its entry to-day and 6 to 5 was the
best to be found, at which price the
gelding was heavily backed. Aubuchon
got him away well and took a lead of
four lengths in the first half. He kept
the colt in front all the way, winning
finally by a length.
The prettiest race of the day was the
fifth, in which Ahola defeated Big Ben
in a desperate finish. The two ran as a
team from the half mile post to the
wire, not more than a head separating
them at any time. Four favorites won.
The track was good and improved
with each race. The weather was ideal
but the card had no special attraction
and the attendance was light. Sum

SARATOGA, N. Y., Aug. 23.â Owing
to an ill-judged ride on the part of.
John A. Drake's apprentice jockey,
Sperling-, who had the mount on J. A.
Kyle's Keynote in the last race to-day,
nearly the whole racing community
here lost many thousands of dollars.
John W. Gates in particular is said to
be $20,000 poorer than he was just be
fore the horses went to the post.
Keynote, which looked to be a good
thing, fell back to the last place soon
after the start. He was several lengths
behind at the beginning 1 of the run
along the back stretch and then began
to close a little. Sperling then began
the ride which beat the horse. He
rushed him from last to first place in a
furlong.
Few expected to see him lose even
then, for he seemed to have his field
beaten, but soon the "black and silver"
of Congressman T. D. Sullivan on
Homestead was seen to be gaining
foot by foot. Fuller on Homestead
gained on Keynote and finally passed
him. Summary:

The sermon that earns most flattery
may tvin fewest eoula.
The date of sailing of the liner Manchuria,
for Japanese and Chinese ,ports has again been
postponed. According to the Pacific Mail
olficiaJs the change In the. date of sailing is
due to the fart that the Siberia, a sicter
liner to the Manchuria, is to be cent to dry
dock for repairs to her stern post. The Man
churia is to take the place of the Siberia en
the run" to the Orient. TbÂ« steamship officials
cay that the refusal of Immigration Commis

on a charge of burglary. It is said
that he recently entered the residence
of J. J. Mack, 2504 Scott street, by
means of a false key. He went to a
room on the second floor and took
from a bureau drawer a lady's gold
watch and neck chain, valued at $200,
and a diamond ring, valued at $100.
He was seen by a servant girl and
ran downstairs and out of the front
door. She called for help, but Hunter
escaped. From a description given of
him by the servant girl Detectives

The Alameda brought 238* passengers
and a cargo which included sugar, cof
fee, bananas and pineapples.
Arming: the passengers was Mrs. "W.
H. Cornwell, the widow of the late
Colonel Comwell. who has been visit
ing frionds in Honolulu. E. M. Boyd
of the Hawaiian Promotion Committee
was also a passenger. The three Misses
Garibaldi are California girls whose
beauty and social charm made them
verÂ»- popular in Honolulu, where they
have been spending a few weeks.
Among the passengers were the fol
lowing:
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Alameda, Captain DowdelUarrived
yesterday from Honolulu. When the
Alameda and Mariposa used to run be
tween here and the Antipodes their
cl.re adherence to the time schedule
was counted a marvel. At a certain
hour on a certain day either one or the
other was due and as surely as the
day and hour arrived there was the
Alameda or Mariposa to confirm the
clocks and calendars of the persons
that established the schedule.
The Mariposa is^contlnuing in the
same path of punctuality on the Ta
hiti run, and the Alameda, on the Hon
olulu run, is keeping true to her early
training. If the overland trains kept
as closely to their time table as does
the Alameda to her schedule passen
gers leaving New York could figure
the time of their arrival here within
an hour.
Among the persons to â¢whom duti
able goods were addressed were the fol
lowing: T. Hurley, G. Fitzmorris, J'.
O. Bell, J. M. Eads, H. Nolte, H. M.
Onyett, J. Neary, Miss L. Colchett. P.
Crawford, Major George Barnett, S.

Charles Malloy, Paymaster Irwin, John
Dexter, J. B. Horton, H. A. Donaldson,
G. M. Coomer, A. Hanlon, M. C. Mikell,
L. D. Miner, G. C. Reiter, F. W. Os
born and Sergeant McNally. Three
thousand cigars were also seized.
Extensive violations of the customs
laws were unearthed last Saturday by
customs inspectors who had been de
tailed to search the United States
naval transport- Solace from Manila,
Honolulu and Guam. On- Saturday
forty-one seizures were made, amount
ing in value to several thousand dol
lars, including cigars, silks, embroid
eries, decorated porcelain and Japanese
curios . The. goods have been sent to
the Appraiser's store for appraisement.
The bringing in of dutiable goods in
Government vessels contrary to law
has been a general practice ever since
the American occupation of the Phil
ippines and the Treasury Department
has lnsisied that the practice must be
broken up. These seizures on former
occasions have been made with consid
erable secrecy, the facts having been
withheld from the press for the pur
pose of sparing the feelings -of the law
breakers, but the Solace seizure was
so large that it could not remain cov
ered up. The goods were found in the
rooms of mates, stewards, machinists,
paymasters and others.
The most notable person connected
with the affair is Rear Admiral Yates
Stirling, United States navy, for whom
was addressed In care of Commander
J. H. Bull at Baltimore, Md., a large
case of Japanese curios, the duties on
which would amount to a respectable
figure. Admiral Stirling is said to have
used the curios In his house for about a
year. A package of pongee Bilk ad
dressed to Mrs. Bull, in care of Com
mander Bull, was found in Captain
Stewart's storeroom.

reach the greatest possible strength In mental

fascinate any one you desire, win the one you
love, bring back your loved one, and cause

There are few things in nature more
v/onderful than the common impulse
which seizes these millions of unde
veloped Insects living in tunnels un
derneath the ground and urges them
, to cut their way upward, that they
may complete their appointed life in
the upper air. Stirred by this strange
unrest, the mighty host begins to
move. What engineering skill directs
their course aloft? What instinct
guides their movements and enables
them with unerring accuracy to bur
row to the sunlight?
If we suppose that a pupa reaches
the surface before it i3 quite prepared
to transform or when the surface is
reached that weather or other condi
tions retard the change to the wing^tf
form, we have the influences that re
quire it to build a shelter. Its man
ner of proceeding is interesting and In
genious. It brings up from its bur
row a little ball of mud, which it car
ries between its mouth and strong
fcrepaws. The latter are admirably
designed for digging. The pellets are
placed atop of one other, aa a mason
wculd lay stones while building: a cir
cular tower. They are moistened by
saliva, which serves as a sort of ce
ment, and are pushed down upon each
other by the head and feet, and thus
adhere tenaciously.
The Inside is smoothed by continue!
motion of the Jaws, as a plasterer
spreads mortar upon a wall. It is nott
varnished, however, as Rome natural-.
Ists have asserted. The top Is closed!
and the builder awaits within the sig
nal to emerge, whereat it breaks
through the top, or occasionally th*
side wall. Like a frontier pioneer, it
leaves its house and moves on. Join
ing the mighty procession of its mi
grant fellows. The huts stand empty
in the silent cicada city, like an aban
doned mining town whose "boom has
burst." or like the winter quarters of
an' army when the spring campaign
calls afield. â Harper's Magazine.

NEW YORK. Aug. 23.â Further weakness in
wheat contributed largely to the strong tone
of the slock market at to-day*9 opening,
though the strength of certain isÂ»ue? seeded
to come largely from buying by some of the
professional element whose Interests lie on the
bull Hide. Prices receded before the end of
the morning and the volume of busiceve. which
at the outset promised to be very considerable,
dwindled to moderate proportions. A canvass
of the better known houses failed to disclose
any increafce In commission business, though
the Middle West was to an extent a factor in
the day's operation?. London, whose markets
were weak bs a result of fresh developments
affecting British Interests In the Far East,
sold a lot cf stock?, chiefly standard railroad
shares, and bought very little. A sharp ad
vance in cotton, based largely on the rise in
Liverpool was doubtless partly responsible for
the reactionary tone in stocks as the day wore
en. The mark.-.t drifted aimlessly and lower
lir^tcs were recorded, with a further reduction
of Â«-peratlons. Of the more actlvs issues
Union Pacific and Southern Pacific held most
firm. Kt. Paul was offered down by brokers
Identified with Western interests, while Atchi
rcn was sold on rumors of frost in the corn
belt. The extreme apathy of the market In
the final hour extended to the bond division,
in which dealings became very light. The
closing reflected uncertainty. Net declines in
the active list were in no Instance very se
vere, the greatest losses being sustained by
New York Central and Sugar, each declining
l#. Southern PatHne closed with a fractional
advance. The storks of the express compa
nies were among the lew noteworthy features
of the day. the gains on light trading reviv
ing romors of a consolidation of these inter
estn. The rub- treasury made a telegraphic
transfer of $200,000 to New Orleans. This Is
fceSkved to represent the flrwt shipment of the
neacon to the rotten fields and attracted some
attention because of the general belief that
the South will thin year have the largest cotton
crop on record. In this event the New York
banks will be called upon for unusually heavy
nnv-.unUi. The Â«um of $200,000 was shipped
to Carexllan basics, precamably to aid the crop
movement in the Dominion. Foreign exchange
eaM-d off â¢ tri1e. with a slight Increase In of
ferings of commercial bills, but not enough to
affect the market.

Potatoe.:, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market ruled steady at pre
vious prices under continued light receipts and
a good demand for local consumption and
available supplies cleaned -up readily. AslJe
from a limited demand for export to northern
port*. therÂ« was very little doing In the ship
ping line. Sweet Potatoes were plentiful and
In good request at the prices established on
the preceding day. Onions were steady inii
the best lots brought a small advance.
Miscellaneous vegetables arrived freely from
all producing sections and the market was
weak, with large lines of carrled-over stock
offering at easy prices. Tomatoes were barely
steady and poor and old lots of Green Corn
were selling below the quotations. Stocks of
other vegetables were steadily accumulating.

Poultry and Game^
No more Western Poultry came In and thÂ»
three carloads that were received on Monday
were pretty well cleaned up. Receipts of do- i
roÂ«Â£tlc stock on the early express were ab-ut
70 coops, and, although most' retailers were
well supplied with Western, trade was active
and. the market cleaned up well at good prices.
The receipts from Petaluma and vicinity were!
very light, as the regular train from that''
section was delayed by an accident.
Game was In light receipt and steady.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
AH conditions remain unchanged. There is
no scarcity In anything. Stocks of Butter
and CheesÂ« are to<j large for the market to
absorb and an accumulation in Butter Is re
ported by almost every house on the street.
Dealers still complain of the surprising dull
ness of trade, which Is all the more marked
because business In all lines of dairy produce
has been remarkably active for the past five
or six years, and this makes the present dull
spell Just bo much more pronounced.
Fine ranch Eggs continue steady, with cup
plies light, but all other grades are plentiful
enough. Receipts, however, seem to be. fall-
Ing off again.
Receipts were 55.700 lbs Butter, 647 cases
Eggs and 5000 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits..
Receipts of email tree fruits, particularly
Pears, Peaches and Plums In bulk, showed a
marked falling off. and. with trade active both
locally and for shipping account, the market
was in good condition for seller?, and close
clearances of the best stock were readily
effected at good prices. Grapes were the
leading feature of the market and good ship
ping Block of all varieties cleaned up well at
Improved values. The flret Isabellas of the
season appeared from Santa Cruz. < Sixty-two
crates came In and met with a good demand
at $1 25 per crate. Supplies of Peaches in
small packages- -were well up to trade re
quirements, but offerings In large open boxes
were light and cleaned up well, the top rats
being easily obtained for the best Clingstones.
The canners raised their bids for Bartlett
Pears and procured the bulk of the available
supplies of green stock. Wrapped Bartlett
Pears sold at a wide range as to size and
condition, as a considerable portion of the re
ceipts were overripe and h%d to be disposed
of quickly. The Apple market was In good
shape, with tha best Gravenstelns firmly held
at an advance. The other tree fruits were
plentiful and generally steady at about pre
vious prices. Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons
ruled firm under decreased receipts, whilo
Watermelons were very dull. Raspberries
were firmer, but everything else in the berry
line was Inclined to easiness. Mexican Limes
were in limited eupply and held at firmer
rateti, while other Citrus fruits were plentiful
and weak. Ripe Bananas werÂ« abundant and
easy. The steamer Alaraeda from Honolulu
brought 3COO bunches of Bananas and 375
crates of Pineapples.

As already mentioned, with the exception
of Prunes and Raisins the market Is In Terr
good shape for growers and sellers, with a
fair demand, especially for Peaches, which
are higher and still tending upward under an
active Inquiry. Apricots and Evaporated Ap

Almonds continue in demand and the recent
marked advances meet with no opposition from
buyers. Everybody realizes that this â¢ year's

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Aug. 23. â There appeared to be
little in the early wheat market news to
j canse the weakness indicated by the opening
prices'. While crop reports were fewer in num- i
bfr, these which came were scarcely more re- i
a*surinc than those which so recently threw ',
1 the trade Into a state of frenzied excitement. '
Nevertheless, in spite of possible further dam- I
ase to crop*, the local tradn arrayed itself j
largely on the selling side of the market. Sep
: tember, which started with a loss of %c to T Â»,c |
at $1 00 to $1 OiHj. slumped to *1 0SÂ»i. while 1
: December, from an Initial loss of s l to lc at i
$1 10 to $1 1"U. paid down to fl ul%. Had !
there been concerted short gelling, the market
would undoubtedly have suffered more than it
did. The longs who led in the unloading.
! however, were chiefly small holders, many of
the larger ones havinfe already sold out. At
the low i<olrvt in both, deliveries better tones
, developed on buying attributed to the North- j
I we?t. A report fr"m Manitoba that some of the ;
I wheat in that jirovince had been nipped by '
! frOHt alfo heliÂ«d the tone to some extent. The |
i result of the Ixijjiro\e.ment 4r> sentiment, was I
! a rally to *1 0*Vi for September, the closing
j flrure. an>l December to *1 10. The latter
i option closed at $1 (H>};@1 O9Â»r.
The weather In the corn belt was too cool
for the peace of mind of trade, and values
w*>re not permitted to suffer with wheat. ;
Ptartinz with a firm undertone, but at prices
unchanirpd to lower, September advanced
from Me to M>-iiioCV&e. December under an
1 equal buying pressure began iÂ£c lower to 'Â»c
: higher at 53c to MV4c and was lifted to M^c
before the demand was satisfied. Liquidation
i brousrht prices back from the high point, Sep- !
] tember reacting to 5o*Â»c and December to
MV4C. the final quotations for the day, but the
; tone in the end was strong.
Oats were active and withstood with but
Elight loss the bearish influence^ of heavy re
ceipts and a tremendous increase in local
stocks. An initial loss of ijjc in the Septem
ber option at 33%c to 33?4c was more than
regained through excellent scattered buying.
The price wenet to 34c. reacted to 33%c, and
i again rallied to the closing figure. 33-%c, with
a very stfady tone.
Provisions were inclined to firmness, being
: helped at the start by an advance of 5<Jn0c In
! the price of hogs and later by the strength In
corn. Trading was chiefly in the way of
chancing from September to later deliveries.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND OEXERAL
FORECAST.
TTBFfjttled weather prevail* over CallfornU.
Vn-aSt and Utah. Light showera are re
ported reneraliy In California, and conditions
ar* ravnrct.l* for thunder etonos In the foot
f'-'t and tnouetalsa.
L!rht rala has fallen at Baa Francisco and
The Increase In production thereforÂ©
is only about 18 p*r cent. There is no
possible prospect that the coming crop
will show an Increase over that of 1S90
commensurate with the increase in
acreage. The reason for this is not
hard to find.
"While the Increase in acreage in the
South for the past fourteen years has
been 63 ppr cent, the Increase in tha
negro population of the South during
the same period has only been 24 pep
cent; and in Texas. Oklahoma and In
dian Territory the Increase in acreage
since 1890 is 124 per cent, while the
increase in the negro population is only
45 per cent. Experience has proved that
under the hot Southern suns the negro
alone can be used for the cultivation off
cotton, and the rapid industrial devel
opment of the South has drawn heavily
upon the negro population for labor in
its mines, lumber camps and railways.
It is probably true that against an
increase in cotton acreage In the South
of 63 per cent in fourteen yÂ«*ars. the
increase in negro labor available for its
cultivation nas not been over 12 per
cent.
These facts, which are taken from the
United States census, point Indubitably,
to only one conclusion.
The South has for the past five years
been planting more cotton acreage than
can be cultivated by the labor avail
able, and the rapid deterioration In its
condition now being reported, and whl^rt
for the past four years haÂ» generally
commenced to develop about this time,
evidences this la^v of cultivation. Dur
ing the early mvnthn of its growth it
needs but little care. Without" care
during its critical period it is bound
to deteriorate. We may as well accept
in my opinion that the maximum cotton
productive capacity of the South was
reached five years ago and cannot be
again attained until the disproportion
between its negro population and Its
acreage shall have been adjusted. No>
such readjustment serins possible with
in the present generation.
Spinners of cotton and consumers off
cotton goods will do Â¦well to ponder and
to heed the sljmlflcance of these facts.
â¢ THEODORE H. PRICE.
NEW YORK. Aug. 23. 1904.â On the
2d of August I advised ths world to
buy cotton. Irrespective of the shfywlns
made by the Government report. Since
that time the market has advanced a>
cent a pound. I again urge those who
are likely to need cotton during tho
next six months to secure their sup
plies, if practicable, on the basis off
present prices.
The fall of Port Arthur Is Imminent*
pacific intervention by the powers will
probably follow, and the impulse there
by given to the world's Industry and
the American and British export tradeÂ»
In cotton goods partxmlarly will prova
the most Important since the resump
tion of specie payment by the UnitetJ
States in 1879. Meantime the condition
of the crop is rapidly deteriorating. In
my opinion, the condition is no hetter
than it was at this time last year. and.
allowing for the reported increase in
acreage, the Indicated crop at present
is hardly over 11.000.000 bales. It is
generally admitted that a moderate crop
will oass into consumption on the basis
of if cents a pound, and that a short
crop means a repetition of last years
wild speculation.
The depredations of the boll weevil,
which Infest a larger area in Texas than
ever before, account in part for th*Â»
rapid deterioration, but equally Impor
tant Is the insufficiency of labor In the
South for the cultivation of the crop-
In the past fourteen years the increase
in cotton acreage as reported by tha
Government is 63 per cent. The crop
of 1890-1 was 8.600.00O bales. The crop
of 1903-4 Is 10.000.000.

MAY ORDER ITS REMOVAL.
The main court of honor of the
Knights Templar Triennial Conclave
may have to be modified. The massive
steel circle that hangs like the ball of
a gigantic pendulum over Market
street, near Kearny, is objected to as'
unsafe. â¢ \ ' :

said that no definite conclusion
was arrived at. An adjournment
was taken until to-morrow morning at
10 o'clock. As the meeting broke up
one of the employers remarked, "Well,
it's half settled."
The Mayor earnestly requested that
nothing be said that would raise up
a barrier between the contending par
ties or would interfere with the peace
able settlement of the matter. E. G.
Pierce, proprietor of the Nevada Sta
bles, stated last night that he was con
fident a satisfactory adjustment of the
trouble would be reached at the con
ference to-morrow.
It is understood that the stable own

Financial Secretary Klllain of the
Stablemen's Union stated that as the
injunction issued yesterday by Judge
Hunt applied to the case of the Nevada
Stables only, the situation was un
changed as regarding the posting of
pickets, pending an appeal to the Su

HANDSOME TROPHY. DESIGNED
BV HAMMERSMITH & FIELD. TO
BE AWARDED AT CONCLAVE.
SMART DINNERS
ARE GIVEN BY
CLEVER HOSTS
Fully 500 standard Pullman cars
have been engaged by the different
transportation companies for the spe
cial Templar trains coming from east
of the Rocky Mountains. It is diffi
cult to estimate how many more pil
grims will come on regular trains and
how many from the interior of Cal
ifornia and up and down the coast.
Oregon Commandery Xo. 1 will escort
the Grand Commandery of Oregon to
and from the conclave. The com
mandery has chartered a special train
and invited other commanderies of
the Oregon grand jurisdiction to join
it in the pilgrimage. The Oregon Sir
Knights regard the coming conclave
as of equal interest to all the people
A trpphy well worth warring for and
to be treasured when won, consists of
the splendid punchbowl, Balver, ladle
and cups designed and made by Ham
mersmith & Field, manufacturing jew
elers, which is to be one of the prizes
of the coming Knights Templar com
petitive drill. The set is certainly a
perfection of the goldsmith's art, car
ried along in a design true to nature
and with its primitive quaintness pre
served in the minutest detail. West
ernesque in idea, the Indian, the for
est and the camp are seen wherever
the engraver's tool has touched.
Every piece of this noble collection
is of copper, dull red and rich, with
ornaments and mountings of silver.
The lining of the great bowl, of the
cups and the lesser bowl of the ladle
is of gold. The big chalice measures
seventeen inches from side to side and
stands fifteen inches high. The circu
lar salver is thirty inches in diameter.
On the rim of the bowl are two silver
Indian heads beautifully modeled, with
four bear heads in the same metal dis
tributed at intervals between them.
There are also two silver coats of
armsâ not of the swords, spears and
battleaxes of the crusader, but of a
graceful design of the ruder weapons
of the red warrior of the West. In fact
the designer of this grand bit of work
approaches the knightly East only in
the necessary inscription on the bowl
and the cross with its conquering sign.
The victorious Templars carrying home
this trophy will see only California in
their prize.
The base of the bowl is mounted with
real arrowheads of flint, jasper, agate
and obsidian onyx, all neatly attached
to it. The red copper salver is rim
med and moi*nted in silver arrowheads
and other Indian designs. The most
unique, as well as artistic features of
this part of the set are the two handles
of buckhorn on the edge of the great
metal plate. The horn is chosen in its
natural shape and bound on with silver
thongs. In the center of the salver is
a field to be filled in with the name of
the crack drill team that gains this
gallant trophy. The ladle is of sterling
silver, its bowl gilded and the handle
is a rare piece of stag horn. The cups
are in perfect keeping with the rest of
the set. The whole is novel, fitting,
rich and beautiful, a noble memento of
California and the Twenty-ninth Tri
ennial Conclave.
THOUSANDS OX THE WAY.
Judge Davis a^ked Searby if the Col
lege of Pharmacy of the University of
California took up the subject of toxi
cology- He said that they did not
treat it as an individual branch, but
the work was covered in other courses.
He said that^ students from the Uni
versity of California should have been
able to answer the questions given by
the examiner on this subject.
At the conclusion of the day Judge
Davis asked the board if they were
dissatisfied with the examination in
any respect and if they wanted to call
any other witnesses. The members of
the Pharmacy Board all agreed to close
the examination and admitted that
they had been given a fair trial.
"I handed in a biU of $20 to the
finance commission for four days," he
eaid. "They advanced me $40, wn.cn
I objected to taking. This caused a
great dsai of wrangling by the board.
Mr. Waller came to me and said that
if I refused to take this money it would"
put the rest of the members in a bad
light. I reluctantly consented to ac
cept it."
Finger ajrain inquired if Searby did
not vote to pass a resolution allow
ing the members $3 per day as expenses
alonir with their per diem. Searby
said ne did, as the members were com
plaining that they were incurring ex
penses on themselves and he voted
for this as a compromise.
That harmony did not prevail while
Eearby was a rr -ber of the board is
evinced by the fact that the minute
book shows that on voting to issue cer
tificates of credentials Searby was con
tinually on the opposite side. Searby
Â°*ttas not sure if it was a difference of
Judgment, but he thought that the
â¢other members of the board were pro
gramming against him.
Searby testified that it had been the
custom of the previous boards on which
he had served v to preserve the examina
tion papers of students for two years.
This board did not do so. As soon
as the members finished marking the
examination papers they had the rat
ings recorded and they then destroyed
the papers. Thus if a pupil should
come to content the markings of the
examiner he had nothing to substan
tiate his ratings, easily giving students
a. chance to whisper scandal.
Professor Finger interrupted and
asked him if he did not vote for a
resolution to allow the members $5 per
day for expenses. Searby denied hav
ing voted that way and said he voted
against it.
The last witness was examined yes
terday in the investigation of the State
Board of Phareiacv and after the
books and other belongings of the
board are thoroughly examined by the
commission the rexwrt of the inves
tigation will be forwarded to Gover
nor Pardee, along with written sug
gestions from each member of the
board as to how the State pharmacy
laws could be amended.
Professor Searb;\ a former member
of the board, , x 'as the principal wit
ness during the day. He criticized the
members of the board for drawing $5
a day as expenses when they were at
tending a meeting out of town.
The meeting was executive and oc
cupied two hours. The differences were
discussed in a friendly spirit. At the
close of the meeting Mayor Schmitz
Representatives of the Stable and
Carriage Owners' Association and the
Stablemen's and Hackmen's Union at
tended a meeting yesterday in Mayor
Schmitz's office for the purpose of ef
fecting a settlement of the strike of
hackmen and stablemen. The good of
fices of the Mayor have been sought
by both sides in the hope that an ad
justment of the differences might be
arrived at.
Judge Hunt also filed his findings
in the case and set forth that he found
T. F. Finn, president of the union, and
T. J. White, its secretary, had con
spired, confederated and combined
with themselves and others to devise
means for impeding the plaintiffs in
the conduct cf their business and by
threats, intimidations and assaults
upon employes taking the place of
strikers tried to compel them
to quit their service. In fur
therance of the . conspiracy the
court finds that they placed pickets
in front of the place of business and
did waylay and assault the non-union
employes; and that in furtherance of
the conspiracy they sent agents to
various customers and demanded the
removal of their horses and vehicles
from the stable under threat of boy
cott.
That the Stablemen's Union, Local No. 8760,
of San Francisco. T. F. Finn and T. J. White,
and each of them and their officers, members,
agents, clerks, attorneys and servants, shall
forever absolutely ilest^t and refrain from and
they are hereby restrained and mjolned from
In anywise interfering -with or harassing or

other way molesting, intlmtdatinf or coercing
or attempting to m'ole-t or intimidate cr coerce
any customer, p.itrcn or employe r.ow or here

In their said business.
If any doubts existed at the time of
Judge Hunt's rendering of his opinion
in the Stablemen's Union case as to
the force of his restrictions of the acts
of boycott, those doubts were removed
yesterday when the decree in the case
was signed. The decree is sweeping
and specific and is here given in full:
