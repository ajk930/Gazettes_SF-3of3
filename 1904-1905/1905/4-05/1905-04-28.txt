CHICAGO. April 27. â Chicago Is
In The throes of the greatest industrial
-conflict in its history. All idea of tem
porizing has been abandoned by even
the most conservative. Already 2500
. drivers are out and the number will
be increased to-morrow. â 
The employers will force the fight
ing and they promise to make the
struggle sharp and decisive. To-night
'the Fair and Boston stores discharged
rta^ir drivers. ,They did not wait for
then, to strike. Already teamsters
are out In most of the big State-street
â tores, and It was realized that noth
ing short of a finish fight would suf
fice.
Business was badly crippled to-day.
Within the next two days it may be
paralyzed, but the merchants have
weighed the consequences and are
ready frrr the issue.
That a Federal injunction will be
asked for to-morrow -is practically
certain. That Federal troops will
follow the iâ â  itioe of the injunction
Is the belief of the employers, as well
as the fear of the labor leaders. Xo
one expects that the police will be
abJe to cose with the situation, which
is hourly growing worse.
* MAY CALL OUT ALL UNIONS.
Threats to extend the strike to in
clude every union ma\ and woman in
Chicago are heard, and some of the
radicals are openly advocating such
a policrJ Others assert that this plan
would be suicidal; but the conflagra
tion has started, and no one can pre
dict, where it will end.
Hvery business in Chicago, with
three or four exceptions, will be in
. volved. Restaurants and hotels were
affected to some extent to-day, and
thousands of patrons of department
stores had to carry home their bun
dies or wait for their delivery later,
when the cloud lifts.
The strike leaders announced to-day
that newspapers, hospitals and all
undertaking establishments would be
excepted from the strike list. United
States mail wagons of course will not
be interfered with. Beyond these
exception;, no promises are made.
Even cab dmers will not haul pa
trons to department stores where a
Ftrike is on. The business of seven
railway express companies was almost
completely tied up to-day, as far as
delivery by wagons went.
The packers have not <*cen drawn
lr>:o the conflict yet, but their drivers
Â«*fave orders not to haul meats to any
of the express depots or to railway de
pots when goods are to be sent by
express. That Hill, in all probabilitj ; .
result in a strlk'J of the packing-house
teamsters to-morrow.
THREE VICTIMS OF RIOTS.
There was rioting in various parts of I
the city to-day despite the strong '
guards of police and private detectives
hired by the Employers* Association
r|to protect its wagons. During the trou
lyblen three persons were seriously in
jured. Two of them will probably die

PARIS. April 27.â N0 little sensation
has been caused in Paris by the call
Herald Caracas special cable trans
mitted to the European edition of the
Herald, regarding the charges made
against First Assistant Secretary of
State Loomis. The Temps last evening
reproduced the Call-Herald dispatch
and added the following version of the
alleged scandalâ a version which, says
the Temps, has been obtained from pri
vate" sources and v.as current in the
foreign legations in Caracas:
"Four or live years ago the New
York and Bermudez Asphalt Company
and another American company, the
Wai-ner-Quinlan Company, had a dis
pute regarding the possession of the
great asphalt lake. Fe'.icidad, and had
a lawsuit over it before the Venezue
lan i-'iurts.
"The Bermudez company obtained
the support of the American legation
and won its case, but this result was
obtained, it is alleged, only by means
of a check for $10,000 paid to the
American Minister at that time â Mr.
L<.o in is.
".Subsequently an agent of the Ber
mudez company displeased his em
ployers and was dismissed. Before leav
ing his post he obtained possession of
the check. - inch had been paid and
duly indorsed, and the correspondence
iHS to it tho whole constituting a
huh enabled this person, a
man named Carner, to promise Presi
dent Castro the support of the State
Department in Washington against the
iork and Bermudez Asphalt Com
pany, because, Loom is being com
promised, it would be powerless to act.
"President Castro, strong in the
knowledge of this scandal, dispossessed
the Bermudez company and offered an
uncompromising resistance to the pro
f the Americans.
â  Thus may be explained the defiant
attitude of the Venezuelan dictator as
regards the United States and the sub
missive attitude of the latter power."
WASHINGTON. April '::.â lt was re
ported here to-night that the true rea

to curtail bis hunting trip and hurry

millionaire Pitt'burg confectioner, who
stirred Pittsburg society by eloping
with a dancing girl, was found in Den
ver this morning in a rooming-house
at 2159 Stout street. Efforts have
been made to find the runaways in

Denver was thoroughly searched, but
so well had young Reymer hidden
himself that he was not discovered un

Mr. and Mrs. Reymer came straight
to Denver after the secret Pittsburg
wedding and have been boarding in a
cheap boarding-house on Stout street

money for his needs and says he is
here to engage in business for him
self. He denied "that his bride accom
panied him, also that she was a danc
ing girl, saying that she worked in a
Pittsburg dry goods store before the
wedding. It was learned, however,
tnat Mrs. Reymer is here and not
with her parents, as her husband
stated.
The father of the young man Is
worth $2,000,000 and the son was heir
to half of this sum. It has been stated
that his angry father disowned him.

carpenter, whose home is in Oliver,
Pa. Reymer has relatives here, but
did not go to them.
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 1905.
Tax Collector Smith's defalcation will exceed $90,000. He left the city last Thursday with Leona Brooks, a woman of the half world,
with whom he was madly infatuated, j From remarks the woman dropped it is inferred the couple left for Mexico. The Grand Jury
yesterday found two indictments for felony embezzlement against the defaulting Tax Collector. Foreman Andrews has expressed some
skepticism as to the former shortage of $165,000 and its restitution. The Board of Supervisors formally removed Smith from the office
of Tax Collector. The money in the City Treasury is being counted under the supervision of the Grand Jury. Smith is still at large.

Edward J. Smith, the defaulting
Tax Collector, took with him Leona
Brooks, a beautiful woman of the
half-world. He left with her on the
JSunstit .Express Tl: bound for
Mexico. The defalcations are now
known to exceed $90,000. These were
the main developments of the inves
tigation made yesterday. The Grand
Jury found two indictments for fel
ony embezzlement against the de
faulter, and a bench warrant has
been issued for his arrest.
The detectives believe that the pair
have headed for El Paso, and intand
iiiK from tii ere to go to Vera Cruz,
where they will take a boat for some
South American country, probably
Honduras, where American criminals
can evade the law.
The items of Smith's defalcations to
date are:
Taxes of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, f,ij,l]3.
Mi ut y obtained from the Treasurer's
effico on a personal check, $15.11.;.

yet accounted for, $!4.7:?5.
Total to date, $91,587.
Foreman Andrews of the Grand Jury
will institute a rigorous inquisition into
the circumstances surrounding the
first shortage of $166,000. He is in
clined to believe that a shortage of that
extent never existed. He will demand
proof that it was made grood.
At a special meeting the Supervisors
removed the defaulting Tax Collector
from his office. His brother, John
Smith, was called before the board to
give evidence against the man who had
disgraced his family. Young Smith's
voice shook and he almost collapsed
on the stand as he told of how his
brother had made two attempts to rob
the city.
Louis A. Devoto was called to ex
plain the cashing of the defaulter's per
sonal check for $15,290. He was ques
tioned minutely on the subject and was
several times asked the pertinent ques
tion "Is that the way you usually do
business in the Treasurer's office?"
Under the supervision of Expert
Young of the Grand Jury and Mayor
Schmltz's expert, Atkinson, a count of
the mcTiey in the treasury was begun.
About $2,000,000 was counted yesterday
and the work will be resumed to-day.
The police are looking for a negro
known as 'Billy" Sampson, who Is sup
posed to have carried Smith's valise to
the train wh'.*n he left on Thursday.
The negro has dropped out of sight.
Acting ' Tax Collector McCabe says
that the exact amount of Smith's defal
cations will not be known until all
owners of property on which taxes are
recorded as delinquent can be heard
from. This may take weeks.

BOSTON, April 27. â John M. Mor-
ris of San Fr&ncisco, a member of the
Junior class at the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, scored a success
this afternoon in one of the leading
feminine roles of a new opera given
by the students of technology. Morris
played the part of the barmaid Â»f the
piece, another feminine role being
taken by A. F. Bancroft, who played
the title role of Chemical Maid.
The production was written entirely
by "techmen" and Is full of eccentric
and catchy dances, one of the latter
being a specialty for "Barmaid" Mor
ris.
Pretty Leona Brooks, Once a Waitress in
Spokane, Is Smith's Companion.
The identity of the -woman who is
fleeing from Justice with San Francis
co's fugitive Tax Collector is no longer
a mystery. She is Leona Brooks, a deni
zen of the half world, of whom he be
came enamored several months ago in
Lob Angeles, and for whom he has
shown an Insane devotion for a number
of weeks. Smith and Leona Brooks left
this city a week ago yesterday on th~
Sunset Express, at 6:45 p. m. They had
transportation as far as Los Angeles,
but it was learned yesterday that they
remained in the city of the Angels
only during the scheduled stop of the
train and proceeded with it eastward.
The exact destination of Smith and
his compaion Is not yet definitely
known to the police and the railroad
officials, but from the remarks made by
himself and the Brooks woman it is to
be Inferred that the fleeing Tax Collec
tor had some point remote from the
possibilities of capture in view, but had
allowed'his companion to believe that
they were going to Mexico on a pleas
ure trip. A local railroad official was
Innocently instrumental In furthering
Smith's plans for escape, he having
purchased a drawing-room on the train
for Smith and his companion and turn
ed over the Pullman ticket Just before
their departure. On Wednesday, April
19, the day following his theft of $14,715,
paid Into Smith's hands by the treas
urer of the Southern Pacific Company,
the railroad official had occasion to call
on Smith at his office in the City Hail
and foud him, apparently in the beat of
spirits, writing at his desk.
ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY.
"You're just the man I want to see.
was Smith's salutation, and turning
around in his chair he told his visitor
that he was exceedingly anxious to go
to Los Angeles that night and wanted
the railroad man to try to get him
drawing-room on the Sunset Bxmes
The railroad man had freauent
obliged Smith by getting him drawing
rooms on the trains to Portland. Ren
and Los A^ngftles, and hurrying down
town he attempted to secure a drawing
room on the evening southbound trai
but failed to get one. He commun
cated the fact to Smith and the latte
appeared to be quite uneasy and in
manner somewhat imploring the sruilty
city official requested that his friend
use every possible effort to engage ac
commodations on the train leaving the
following night '
Several times later in the day Smith
rang up his friend and asked him about
the drawing-room and expressed much
relief when he was finally informed
that the accommodations had been se
cured for Thursday night's train. Early
Thursday Smith called at the office of
his friend and got his Pullman ticket

Maror City and County of San Francisco.
Dated Awl! ?7. 1906.
After the charges had been read the
Mayor stated that City Attorney Long
had suggested that they be verified.
Emmons Blackburn Ryan, tax at
torney for the Southern Pacific Com
pany, â was first placed on the stand to
show the payment of the money for
the company's taxes to Smith. Ryan
stated that Smith had made a hurried
call on him at his office on April 4
last and asked him to pay the second
installment of taxes.
SATS DEPUTIES WERE IDL.E.
"Smith tcld me that his deputies had
nothing to do and were lounging
around and he wanted them to be
working. He mentioned that the
French bank and others were going to
pay their taxes. I took Smith to
Treasurer N. T. Smith of the company,
who gave him a check for $24,378.48.
We received two vouchers in the sums
of $6694.72 and $17,683.76, together with
the receipted tax bil!s from the Tax
Collector. On April 18 Tax Collector
Smith was given another check for
$14,735 03, made payabel to his order. ,
â¢This check came back to us in the
regular order indorsed by John E. Mc-
Dougald, City Treasurer. I do not
think that E. J. Smith ever came to
us before in person to collect taxes.
I saw no reason for the irregularity,
except for the one he assigned at the
time, that his clerks had nothing to
do. 1 '
James W. McCabe. acting Tax Col
lector, identified the signature of E. J.
Smith on the Indorsement of the check.
"So far as I know, 1 said McCabe,
"the money for the taxes paid by the
Southern Pacific Company hats not
been turned into the city treasury and
the corporation stands delinquent on
our books."
Chlpf Deputy Treasurer Louis A.
Devoto tpstififd to his having cashed
the check for $14,735 03 signed by F.
Black Ryan, which Tax Collector
Smith had presented to him on Thurs
day of last week. 'Devoto also told o?
his having cashed the personal cheek
of E. J. Smith for $15,590 08 on the
Crocker-Woolworth Bay.k. which re
turned the check last Wednesday
marked "no funds."
PINS DEVOTO DOWN.
Supervisor Brandenstein asked par
ticularly as to the cashing of the two
checks with the object of placing the
responsibility for the amounts on De
voto.
Ir. point of fact, you cashed the
check for $14,735 03 which was in
tended for the payment of taxes, but
the city was in nothing. ae you had
previously paid the amount irt fan^a
of the city to Smith. You also cashed
his personal check for $15,590 08 with
money belonging to the city."
If Brandeneteln's contention is cor
rect either Devoto or City Treasurer
McDougald will be liable for $30.
725 11 of Smith's shortage.
John R. Smith, who reported to the
Mayor that his brother was a de
faulter, was the next to take the stand
and was evidently overcome with his
emotions and the terrible strain to
which -he has been subjected. He was
but briefly questioned and told in
trembling tones that his brother had
left him last Thursday afternoon, say
ing that he was going on a trip to Los
Angeles.
"I have absolutely no idea of his
whereabouts." said Smith, as he with
difficulty restrained the tears from
welling to his eyes.
Deputy Treasurer Perkins told of
how Cashier Gray had stated that
there were no funds to the credit of
Tax Collector Smith in the bank and
had not been for some time when
Smiths personal check, which had
been cashed by Chief Deputy Devoto,
was presented for payment.
George E. Starr, treasurer of thÂ«
l'nitÂ°d Railronds, told of a conversa
tion he had with Tax Collector Smith
t<> the effst* that the City Treasurer
could handle silver when the taxes of.
the corporation were paid.
SMITH ASKS FOR SILVER.
"Smith called, me up on the tele
phono," said ;Â»tarr, "and told me he
would take $20,000 in silver the next
day. He Â«lid not do wo. and the next
day he called me up again and said th<s
money would be taken, but he did not
specify/ the time. I heard no more
about the matter from him. We have
always paid our taxes in coin to the
City Treasurer. Once we paid , Smith
28,500. for. which he gave us a per
sonal check, but. later he gave us a
check Â«ierned as Tax Collector, which
was cashed."
Thomiis P. Andrews, foreman of thÂ»
Grand Jury, was put on the stand to
tell of tne evidence of deputies in the
tax oinoe that Smith had riot Been for
â¢ week.
"I have information." said Andrews,
"that Fmlth was assisted on Thursday
afternoon by a colored man, who car
ried a dress-suit case."
The colored man is said to be "Bil
ly" Sampson, who was one of a nu
merous bodyguard who lived off the
bounty of Tax Collector Smith when
he had money to throw to the birds.
"Is there any one present to appear
for E. J. Smith." asked the Mayor.
No one answered, and City Attorney
Long snid that some showing should
be made that the police officials have
been making efforts to find Smith.
"I was informed to-day by the Po-
Mro Department," said the Mayor,
"that it is unable to r"nd him."
REMOVED FROM OFFICE.
Thereupon Supervisor Brandenstein
introduced the following resolutions

OWES EXPOSURE
TO HIS BROTHER
MILWAUKEE. April 27.â The latest
, step in the career of Frank G. Bige
low, the former bank president who
defaulted in the sum of a million and a
; half dollars, is the filing of a petition
In voluntary bankruptcy. The revised
schedules show a total liability on the
part of Bigejow of $3,277,000, of which
$1,975,000 is wholly or in part secured.
| Of the remainder $1,110,000 is a second
: ary liability on notes and bills dis
counted, in which Bigelow figures as
i lndorser. These items are notes of the
I National Electric Company, the Grand
Rapids Edison Company and S. W.
Wat kins, and are evidently connected
with the financing of the National
.Electric Company. The balance,
$192,000, represents unsecured loans, the
: largest one being an indebtedness of
$100,000 to the Brodhead estate, of
which Bigelow was executor.
The assets of the bank are estimated
at $1,849,800, against which a home
stead exeniDtic-n of $5000 is placed.
The rest of the assets consist chiefly
of stocks in various industrial and
other enterprises and 1600 acres
of coal land in Huerfano County, Colo
rado, valued at $100,000.
The filing of the schedule revealed
the fact that Bigelow, who has been
louked upon as a model of business sa
gacity, pursued startlingly loose meth
ods in the transaction of his private
business. He was not positive of the
names of several of his creditors, and
had no memoranda with which to re
fresh his memory.
Under the bankruptcy laws the
turning over by Bigelow of $300,000
worth of property as a restitutionary
measure to the bank is null and void,
the transfer having been made within
four months of the filing of the peti
tion in bankruptcy. This, however,
will not affect the bank, the directors
having more than made up the entire
deficiency caused by the defalcations
of the president.
Late to-day Judge Landls appointed
the Wisconsin Trust and Security
Company receiver of the bankrupt es
tate of Frank G. Bigelow.
CHICAGO, April 27. â William Big
elow, cashier of the First Nationaf
Bank and brother of Frank G. Bige
low. defaulter, accidentally exposed his
brother to the directors is the story
that is accepted in banking circles as
the true version as to how the crime
became known Saturday night- It
seems that Frank G. Bigelow was
tailed out of town Saturday and that
the affairs of the bank were left In
the hands of his brother. Saturday
morning a telegram came addressed to
Bigelow from a New York bank, stat
ing that It was willinar to take care of
a draft for $50,000, even though the
bank was already indebted to the New
York house for $200,000.
William Bigelow could not under
stand the matter and was more puz
zled when he discovered that the New
York bank was charged in the books
with being indebted to the First Na
tional for $200,000. He asked the
bank to explain and found that the
telegram was correct. An examina
tion of the books followed, and he
found so many queer things that he
decided not to wait for his brother
to return, but to consult with Mr.
Pfister. They immediately suspected
one of the rqshiers of defaulting and
called a special meeting of the di
rectors.
Frank G. Bigelow returned, but did
not see his brother until he reached
the bank in the evening to attend the
meeting. When the directors had
assembled William Bigelow told what
be had discovered and stated he had
no idea of the amount taken or who
the criminal was. Thereupon his
brother arose and made the startling
disclosure that he was a defaulter for
more than $1,000,000.
CORONER INVESTIGATING

GRAND JURY
INDICTS ON
TWO COUNTS
Formally Charges
Defaulter With
Felonies.
Inquires Into the Al
leged Shortage
of $165,000.
The Grand Jury yesterday found two
separate indictments for felony em
bezzlement against the defaulting Tax
Collector, Edward J. Smith. One theft
is of $24,378 48, the other of $14,736 03.
This is the tax money of the Southern
Pacific Company, which Smith has mis
appropriated. A bench warrant was
issued for his arrest.
The Grand Jury assumed complete
charge of the investigation of Tax Col
lector Smith's defalcations. Though
Foreman Andrews started to examine
witnesses at 9 in the morning and the
work of investigation continued till
midnight, no accurate estimate of
Smith's peculations was arrived at. At
least $90,000 has been taken, as far as
Expert Young can determine.
The systems of bookkeeping in the
Tax Collector's office and the Treas
urer's office, according to Andrews
and Young, are execrable. There are
loopholes for bigger stealings than
those of Smith in either office.
James McCabe, who has been ap
pointed to succeed the defaulting Tax
Collector temporarily, informed the
jury that it would be Impossible to
find out exactly how much of the
city's money has been taken until all
the delinauent taxes have been heard
from. To do this will take several
weeks. Postal cards will have to be
sent to the owners of property on
which taxes are delinquent. There is
outstanding $112,000.
THE $165,000 SHORTAGE.
John Smith, who reported his broth
er's defalcations to the Mayor, was
closely questioned as to the previous
shortage of $165,000 made good by
James B. Smith. Foreman Andrews
and Expert Young were skeptical as
to this story. They maintain that
there is nothing to show that such a
shortage ever existed.
"Well, it didn't exist," said John
Smith. "It was made good when it
was due. Nobody knew about it, but
myself and my two brothers."
"How was it paid.- asked Foreman
Andrews.
"My brother, James B. Smith, turned
it over in three checks. I don't know
bow my brother, the Tax Collector*
turned it into the treasury, but it was
there when it was needed. It's hazy to
me now. I was Just as excited then as
I am to-day."
"Can you get some sort of proof that
a shortage existed and that it was
paid?"
"I think so," Smith replied.
He was requested to bring the proofs
to the full meeting of the Grand Jury
In Judge Lawlor's court in the evening,
but failed to produce them. Finally he
admitted that he had nothing but the
statements of himself and his brother
to substantiate the story of the first
shortage.
E. Black Ryan, tax attorney for the
Southern Pacific Company, produced
receipts and vouchers for $39,113 51,
which he had received from Edward J.
Smith for the company's installments
of taxes. The receipts were signed by
Smith and the vouchers were marked
with the receipt stamp of the Tax Col
lector's office and O. X.'d with the ini
tial S.
F. Knerr, a clerk in the office, pre
pared the vouchers at Smith's order
and placed the stamp upon them.
Smith attended to the collections him
self: Knerr was called as a witness,
but could throw little light on the
transaction. He produced the books on
which the company's taxes still ap
peared as delinquent.
J. Miller of the License Office told
how Smith had been accustomed to
draw sums of from $200 to $300 on that
office. A balance sheet countersigned
by Auditor Baehr was introduced, on
which $320 v.a? entered as paid to Ed
ward J. Smith on a tag. This was en
tered under the head of cash on hand.
Cashier Jackson was closely ques
tioned in regard to the $165,000 trans
action, but declared that he knew
nothing about it. From his answers
Foreman Andrews is inclined to doubt
that the shortage could have reached
that amount. Jackson said that at one
time he thought that there seemed a
possibility of a shortage of $8000 or
$12.n00, but that it was made up imme
diately. "In fact." he declared. "I can
not say that a shortage did exist at all
last year."
JAMES SMITH PRESENT.
James B. Smith was present at the
meeting In Judge Lawlor's court, but
when the jury began to deliberate on
the indictment of his brother he ask
ed to be excused and retired.
Louis A. Devoto, who cashed Smith's
personal check for $15,290, was called,
but was not examined. His case will
be taken up by the Jury to-day.
Other witnesses who were called are
A. Dijeau and E. R. Zion of the Tax
Collector's office, and Deputy Treas
urer Hebro.
At the morning meeting James A.
Code and Harry Hull were called rela
tive to dummy demands made on the
treasury by Smith, amounting to $4500.
Cnde testified that Hall did not make
out the demands and had nothing to
do with them. It was Smith's habit
to make out a demand in favor of
some man for a month's work. The
man would go to a money broker, said
to be I. Franklin, with a note from
Smith that he would be put to work
in the tax office. The man would re
ceive the amount of the demand less
the usual 3 per cent. Smith would
get the money, less probably $20.
which he turned over to the man. The
man was not put to work and when
the money brokers protested. Smith
would give hie personal note as se
curity for the amount.

Leona Brooks
Joins Smith
in His Flight
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
Alma Russell and Leona Brooks were
chums. For months, while Leona
Brooks was an inmate of the Ellis
street house, the two women, accom
panied by the former proprietor of the
place, were frequenters of the local
theaters on opening nights and were
conspicuous by their personal adorn
ments. Alma is a tall and rather hand
some brunette, while Leona is equally
tall and attractive, but of a blonde
type. Of her friend's career Alma Rus
sell said as little as possible last night,
apparently fearing that any statement
she might make would possibly aid in
spoiling what she and other of Leona's
acquaintances seem to think was
planned as an elopement and will ulti
mately end in the marriage of Smith
and the Brooks woman in some distant
part of the Western Continent. Alma,
when convinced that the route taken
by the fleeing couple was known,
thought for a moment and replied:
"Well, they are not many days'
traveling away from San Francisco."
LEONA BROOKS' CAREER.
Leona Brooks' career has been traced
back by the police to a few years ago
when she was a waitress in a Spokane
hotel. From there she drifted south
to this city and entered the notorious
house on Ellis street, where she re
mained for several years, leaving it
about two months ago. She went to
Los Angeles and it was there she met
Smith during one of his periodical
visits to that city. At the time he was
showing considerable attention to
Lillian Leslie and was lavishly spend

he had persuaded Leona to return to
San Francisco, where they had since
found much pleasure In each other's
company.

TOTAL AMOUNT STOLEN BY DEFAULTING
TAX COLLECTOR MAY REACH $100,000.
EXACT SUM WILL NOT BE KNOWN TILL LIST IS MADE OUT
t
The shortage of Edward J. Smith,
. the embezzling ex-Tax Collector, is
grc-ving at a rapid rate and it looks
as if the amount he stole from the city
will be-in excess of $90,000. It would
not be surprising if the actual amount
of his stealings will reach $100,000, or
'even exceed that sum.
Yesterday additional shortages ag
. gregsting $12,012 49 were uncovered by
Grand Jury Expert Young and the
Mayor's expert, Thomas E. Atkinson, j
increased the shortage to $90,000. j
They discovered after an investigation
*of the records that $2674 IS paid for
â¢taxes by E. W. Hopkins, $1412 31 paid
by Isaac Kohn and $3761 50 by H. J.
Seiners, "were not entered as paid on
â  the tax books, although these property
o'-vners produced receipts signed by E.
J. Smith for the amounts named.
Chief Deputy Treasurer Devoto
stated that Smith had presented the
last named check to him on April IS
last and he, Devoto, had given him the
money for the same. Devoto did not
know anything about the other checks
and they were probably cashed some
where else. This increases the amount
of the city's funds turned over to
Smith by Devoto on three checks to
, $34,086 61.
The experts have a list of several
other large delin"quen + taxpayers, but
it will not be known whether they paid
their taxes to Smith until they have
been communicated with. In fact, this
pÂ«int would indicate that there may
be no limit to Smith's peculations.
DELINQUENCY INCREASES.
"We will not know whether taxpay
ers marked delinquent on the rolls
. have paid their taxes until we send
them a postal card notifying them of
J.he delinquency," said Acting Tax Col
lector McCabe. "The delinquency on
the books has increased from $99,000,
as computed yesterday, to $112,927 05."
As the normal delinquency is fig
ured at $60,000, it was estimated that
Smith's shortage would be 'some $39,000.
The increased delinquency would raise
â¢ the shortage to $54,000, to say nothing
of the thousands of dollars collected
by Smith on the big checks from De-
Voto and others yet to be heard from.
The experts found that the Goewey
* estate was delinquent for about $4000
and ascertained that this was correct,
as the estate has not paid its taxes.
Evidently this was one item that Smith
had overlooked. .": ' . :
The experts also discovered that
Smith has taken $14*7 deposited by the
theaters for their licenses, for which,
however, no licenses were issued, pend
ing the dispute as to the violations'
of the theater ordinance. Smith saw
an opportunity here and availed him
self of it.
Then Smith took $2437 50 which the
United Railroads paid over to him

that Edward Smith was not actually
short the sum of $166,000 in his ac
counts in April, 1904. which his brother,
James B. Smith, made goud at the
time. It is asserted that Edward de
ceived his brother and appropriated
the money to his own use. John Smith
says this could not have been, as he
himself brought two checks for $84,000
and $81,000 to the city treasury to make
up the shortage. The Treasurer's of
fice has a receipt for $84,000, signed by
Deputy A. W. Hobro on May 19, 1904,
hut the other receipt could not be
found. The Grand Jury will pursue an
inquiry along those lines and has sub
penaed James B. Smith, who is also
a grand juror, to explain his know
ledge of the big shortage. Supervisor
Brandenstein, who was with the
Grand Jury yesterday morning, said
that James Smith only had Edward's
word that there was a shortage.
"The books showed that the money
was paid," said Brandenstein. "The
money was secured from the banks
on James Smith's checks by Treasurer
j McDougald and the city was not out
â  anything. These transactions only go
j to show that the check system should
be done away with and taxpayers
should pay their taxes in coin, no mat
ter what the hardship may be."
"That's right," said Chief Deputy
Treasurer Devbto, who was standing
near. "I will take no more checks for
taxes. The coin must be produced at
I that window. I am through accommo
| dating people."
"It looks to me." said Brandenstein,
"that of the shortage of $54,000 as orig
inally estimated this month, the city
is out $24,000 and the Treasurer is out
"some $30,000, covering the two checks
cashed for Smith by Devoto." â¢
It was learned that Smith had sold
the horse and buggy belonging to his
brother, James, to I. Franklin, the
money broker, shortly before he fled
from the city. Smith also disposed of
his Jupiter rteel stock for several
thousands of dollars and sold his stock
in the California Jockey Club for $3000,
all of which swelled his clean-up.
Smith, prior to his departure from
this city, assigned his pay warrant for
the month of April over to I. Franklin,
a money broker. The warrant was for
the sum of $333 33 1-3. Franklin pre
sented his claim to the office of the tax
payer this morning and wanted the
j official* in charge to acknowledge his
claim. They declined to do this. What
money is coming to Smith on his pay
account will be turned over to help
square his deficit.

out writs of attachments in the Sher
iff's office on the property belonging
to Edward J. Smith, the absconding
Tax Collector. The attachments
cover the amount of the original
shortage discovered, amounting to
$39,112 68. The property levied
upon by the Sheriff includes the fam
ily home at 339 Fair Oaks street,
where Smith resided with his wife
and daughter, whom he abandoned.
Two lots in the Heyman tract and
property in Alameda County were
also levied upon, and also the drug
store formerly belonging to Smith but
now in the name of his brother,
James B. Smith, who made up Smith's
shortage of $165,000 in April of last
year. The drug store is assessed at
$1700 and the real estate at $4000,
but the market value is about $8000.
The home on Fair Oaks street is
heavily mortgaged. A Sheriff's keeper
was placed in charge of the drug
store. Long says that the attachments
were the first to be served on Smith's
property and that the city will be
protected to the amount realized
thereon.
DETECTIVES
DISCOVER
MURDERERS
Two ex-convlcts have been positively
identified by the detective department
of this city as the men who held up the
saloon of John C. Brutt at Second and
Brannan and who are responsible for
the murder of Thomas J. Reilly, who
was present when the robbery was at-
tempted. v
The names of the men and their de
scriptions have been telegraphed to
Sheriffs throughout the State and
Chiefs of Police in all large cities, and
the arrest of the men seems but a mat
ter of a short time.
The two men whom the police will
charge with the attempted hold-up
and murder are Frank Sweeney, alias
Reilly, and James Brown. Both have
bad records. Sweeney's prison num
ber is 9581 and Brown's is 9400. Both
were released only a short time ago.
Captain of Detectives Burnett and De
tective Thomas Ryan refuse to state
what evidence they hold against the
men, but it is learned that two of the
suspects now under arrest have made a
confession in which they assert posi
tively that Sweeney and Brown enter
ed thÂ° saloon and that one of then fired
the shot that killed Reilly.
Several answers to telegrams had
been received at a late hour last night,
but their contents could not be learned.
This morning Chief Dinan will prepare
circulars with the pictures of the men
that will greatly Â» assist outside officers.
The suspects are well known through
ALL UNIONS MAY STRIKE,
Continued From Page 1, Column 1.
dent Mark Morton of the company,
who is a brother of Paul Morton, Sec
retary of the Navy, had more than
$1,000,000 at his disposal and ample as
surances from business men that he
could have as many times that amount
as was necessary.
Throughout the day officials of the
Teamsters' Union were active in scat
tering warnings where they had no
ground, according to their rule, for the
calling of a strike. One of the first
places where they called was the of
fice of the Parmelee Company. This
company has a contract with all the
railroads entering Chicago for the
transportation of all baggage between
stations and downtown hotels and em
ploys many drivers. It was warned
that if it made any deliveries to or
from any of the boycotted stores its
men would be called upon to strike
at once. Similar warnings were given
to baggage and parcel delivery firms
and especially to coal dealers. It is
the intention of the Teamsters' Union
to shut off as far as possible all sup
plies of coal from the establishments
where strikes have been called.
In order to- protect their wagons and
drivers from assault while passing
through the streets, the Employers'
Association has engaged the services of
a large number of guards, and these
men have shown a decided disposition
to retaliate vigorously when any at
tack is made upon them by strike sym
pathizers. This afternoon a wagon
containing twenty-two non-union col
ored teamsters was passing the corner
of Desplaines and Harrison streets,
when it was attacked by a crowd of
strike sympathizers who ran out of a
saloon. Several bricks were thrown
and one of the negroes was struck,
whereupon he drew a revolver and fired
into the crowd, hitting nobody. The
mob broke and scattered.
At West Taylor and Desplaines
streets a dozen non-union men were
more or less seriously injured by mis
siles thrown by a crowd.
Another disturbance took place at
State a"d Adams streets when two
wagons loaded with cc-ai were driving
past. A man in the crowd struck one
of the private detectives guarding the
wagon and the detective promptly
knocked him into the gutter.
Guarded by 150 private detectives em
ployed by the Employers' Teaming
Company, five coal wagons from the
Daniels Coal Company passed over the
Grand-street viaduct this afternoc-n.
Teamsters who were engaged around
the freight houses underneath the Â»via
duct Jeered the non-union drivers and
commenced to throw stones. A prompt
display by the detectives of their re
volvers quelled this disturbance.
WITTMAN BRINGS SUIT
TO COLL.ECT SALARY
Says He Is Entitled to Emoluments
That Go With Office of Clilef
of Police.
A petition for a writ of mandate
was filed by ex-Chief of Police Witt
man yesterday to compel the payment
to him of the salary attached to the
office of Chief of Police for the months
of February, March and April, the sal
ary being $333 33 a month. In his
petition Wittman, who is represented
by Congressman Julius Kahn, goes
over the ground of his action for res
toration to him of the office from
which he contends he was illegally re
moved.
His suspension on February 16 and
dismissal by the Board of Police Com
missioners on March 24 last, he says,
were illegal and without cause and
hence he is entitled to the salary as
well as the office. Auditor Baehr,
Treasurer McDougald and Chief Dinan
are made defendants in the suit for
salary.
out the State and over the Pacific
Coast.
Though the police are reluctant to give
out any information, it is admitted that
as soon as Sweeney and Brown are cap
tured they will be chrged with the
crime and that evidence of a sensa
tional character will be Introduced.
COUNT OF CITY TREASURE BEGINS
UNDER GRAND JURORS' EYES.
Joint Custody Safe Is Opened and Many Bags
of Gold Are Weighed.
Work Ceases at $ O'Clock and Steel Doors
Are Sealed Until Renewal.
With the object of ascertaining if
the funds in the city treasury are in
tact the Grand Jury yesterday began
counting the bags of money in the
vaults. There were present at the
counting Auditor Harry Baehr and
City Treasurer John E. McDougald,
who hurriedly returned from Mon
terey; T. P. -Andrews, foreman of the
Grand Jury; Grand Juror H. Pauson;
F. H. Gilbert, manager of the National
Surety Company, which is on ex-Tax
Collector Smith's bonds for $100,000;
E. A. O'Connor, expert of the Grand
Jury; Mayor's secretary George B.
Keane and several deputy treasurers
and auditors.
The joint custody safe was opened
by the Auditor and the Treasurer and
the work of counting the coin was be
gun. The first sack, containing $20,000,
was opened, counted and then weigh
ed. The other sacks were then opened
and weighed only. The weight of a
sack of $20,000 was ascertained to be
1079 ounces, Troy weight. There was
a slight variance in the weight of the
sacks, but it is presumed that they
contained the required amount, in view
of the fact that they were opened and
not "hefted" in the bag, as was done
just before defaulting Treasurer Wid
ber succeeded in getting away with
$116,000 of the city's money.
One hundred sacks were counted In
the manner stated, the amount aggre
gating $2,000,000. As there is $5,940,000
in the joint custody vault, it will take
a day or two more to count the coin.
At B o'clock the vault was closed with
the joint locks of the Auditor ftnd the
Treasurer. The Grand Jury and the
surety company each placed its seal
on the vault, which will be opened
again at 9 o'clock this morning and
the count resumed.
The money outside bf the joint cus
tody safe â will also be counted. This
amounts to more than $1,000,000, and

TRAIN SERVICE
DISCONTINUED
LOS ANGELES, April 27. â Twenty
five regular passenger trains between
Los Angeles and nearby suburban
points have been ordered discontinued
by the Southern Pacific, the direct re
sult of competition from electric lines.
This is the most sweeping action tak
en by a local railroad since the elec
tric roads were built into the country
and to the beaches.
The lines affected are those to San
ta Monica, San Pedro. Long Beach
and Whittier. Under the new order
of things only one regular passenger
train will be run daily each way be
tween Los Angeles and each of the
points named.
An enormous decline in passenger
travel by steam roads to the stations
affected is given as the reason for tak
ing: off the large number of trains.
Railroad officials say that for eight
een months passenger trains have been
run at a loss to and from the adja
cent cities, which are reached by the
trolley lines, and that the reduction in
train service is necessary to guard
against further loss.

Grace McXauphton Chambers, who j
figured prominently in the police cir- !
dcs of Oakland as the result of a
Charge of robbery brought against her
by Mrs. Thomas Mem, is being sought
on a warrant issued by Judge Fritz ,
to answer a charge of disturbing the |
peace. The complainants this time are i
Mrs. Harriet Zemsen of 19 RauÃch j
street and Mrs. Minnie Hayward of j
117 Oak street, who also charge Mrs. j
Emma McNaughton and Mrs. Maude !
Ramsay with disturbance. Mrs. Me- ;
Naughton is the wife of Harry Me.- j
Naughton. brother of Grace McXaugh- j
ton Chambers, and Mrs. Ramsay is '
the letter's sister. Grace McNaughton
annexed the name Chambers by mar- ,
king the Oakland detective who I
brought her back from Los Angeles |
to answer the robbery charge.
Harry McNaughton was arrested on
p.aday at 19 Lily avenue on a
charge of failure to provide for his
child, and this is the cause of the other
warrants. When Grace learned that
her brother was under arrest she and
her sister and sister-in-law, Emma,
went to the home of Mrs. Zemsen and
indignantly demanded her reason for
the arrest of Harry McNaughton.
Not being satisfied with the answer,
it is alleged that they proceeded to de
molish things. Mrs. Minnie Hayward
was presort when the three women
arrived at Mrs. Zemsen's. They ac
cused her of being the cause of Mc-
Naughton'B troubles, and, it is said,
threatened her life. Mrs. Zemsen at
tempted, to put the women out, but
was put to ignominious flight by the
threatened use of hatpins.

all the trouble, is being held as hostage

HARRIMAN
AND GOULD
IN A TILT
Latter Resigns From
Union Pacific
Directory.
Speria! Diepateh to The Call.
CHICAGO. April 27.â George Gould
resigned to-day from the directory of
the Union Pacific Railroad. This ac
tion is regarded as the outcome of a
tilt with Edward H. Harrlman, who
controls the Union Pacific, and South
ern Pacific system, over tha recent ao
tlon taken In pushing the completion
of the Western Pacific road. Gould Is
the principal factor in the control of
tlie Denver and Rio Grande and the
Western Pacific Railroad, about to be
constructed from Salt Lake to San
Francisco.
The "official" explanation of Gould's
resignation is that he had been elected
on the distinct understanding between
him and tha controlling interests In
the Union Pacific that he would re
sign from the directory if he decided
at any time to build the Western Pa
cific.
" I have put in my resignation be
cause I thought that, as I am Inter
ested in the Western Pacific, it would
not be right for me to remain upon
the board of directors of a competing
line." said <"inuld. "I dn not think that
thÂ«* resignation should be considered
as having any other Figniflcanee."
G^uld said he had also resigned fro;n
the directorate of the Oregon Short
Line. Asked "How about the Burling
ton?" he replied:
"I cannot say as to that."

â¢ DR^PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
BOOZE OR MEDICINE?
Which will you have? If a woman suf-
fering from one of the delicate ailments
peculiar to your sex It will be well for
you to know that Dr. Pierco's Favorite
Prescription is the only remody adver-
tised for such maladies which is abso-
lutely free from intoxicating liquors and
all other harmful agents. The good you
feel from Its use is not the delusive ex-
hileration from a tippling beverage, from
â which the system reacts into a worse
condition than before. It may be a little
slower in manifesting its bracing and
invigorating action, but its benefits are
none the less positive : nd, best of all,
they are lasting. It's an honest medi-
cine â not a beverage.
*" I have been takin? your medicine for the
last three weeks and can â a] I am gaining
strength." writes Mrs. Seneth Kinny. of 605
East Madison Street. Mount Pleasant, lowa,
" I have been having very poor health all win-
ter. I doctored with our t atnllr doctor but
wes relieved only while taldng the medlclna.
I took Dr. Plerce's medicine several year*
aeo. I knew it was rood for any one suffer-
ins with female trouble. Have taken only

till my heart would almost stop beating:.
Have bad one child since first taking your
medicine. If I continue with your treatment
am positive I will be cured."
â¢ Every raftering woman in this land

certainly he can help her to health and
strength. It costs nothing to write -and

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
FIGHT FOR BIG ESTATE
TYRANNY OF A BABE IS INVOLVED
Judge Kerrigan has been occupied
for two days with an interesting con
test in the valuable estate of Franklin
Hey wood. The widow and the daugh
ter are in the case, and each claims
the light to a homestead and a family
allowance. These rights represent a
value of at least $50,000. out of an estate
of about a quarter of a million.
The fontest of the widow's claim is
bas<=-d upon the fact that she and the
husband by written articles of separa
tion, agreed to live separate and apart
during their natural lives, and that
neither should be compelled to live or
cohahit with the other from the date
of the separation, which occurred <>n
July 10, 1890, over thirteen years before
the husband's death.
The widow admitted on the witness
stand that from the time of separation
she never lived in the family home, and
that the husband's residence was occu
pied by him and his daughter, Agnes
Maud Heywood, and no one else except
the necessary servants and house at
tendants. But the widow is attempting
to overcome the legal effect of the
separation articles by the claim that
she was forced into the separation
through the extraordinary influence
that the daughter had over the father.
She says that this influence began
when the daughter was an infant of
17 months, when the father recognized
and, in fact, Installed the baby as
"boss" of the family establishment and
deposed the wife from her just rights.
The widow says she stood this infant
sovereignty for three years and then
concluded that her limit of endurance
of this childish tyranny had been
reached.
Accordingly ?he proposed a separa
tion, which the husband agreed to, he
giving her valuable property rights
and settling an allowance upon her of
$150 per month for life.
But it seems that it was the case of
a woman's "she would and she would
not," for two weeks after the separa
tion she began an attempt to get back
to her husband and former home, and
kept up her efforts in this line during
the rest of the husband's life, but
without success. It is claimed, how
ever, by the widow, although she never
succeeded in getting back into the
family home, that about a month
before the husband's death a recon
ciliation was effected, which was about
to go into operation when the sudden
â death of the husband Intervened.
The widow's testimony in support of
this alleged reconciliation was not
completed yesterday, and the case was
continued by Judge Kerrigan until
next Wednesday for further hearing.
The child who is claimed to have
caustd all this trouble fifteen years
ago Is now a handsome young woman
of 19 years and a member of the class
of 190 V of the University of California.
Hh*> has been in possession of the fine
family residence ever since the father's
death. Attorney Timothy J. Lyon
represents the daughter and J. B.
Reinstein and W. P. Johnson appear
on behalf of the widow.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', FRTDAY, APRIL 2S, 1905.
LATE CAPITALIST AND ADOPTED
JMI'OHTKK WHO IS CONTESTING
ESTATE WITH MRS. HEYWOOD.
STRONG PLEA
FOR BUNKERS
SACRAMENTO, April 27.â H. L. Par- j
tridge of San Jose opened the argument â 
for the defense to-day in the trial of
Harry Bunkers, the deposed State Sen
ator, who was Indicted for bribery. He
concluded his argument late this after
noon and Attorney Morehouse followed
f^r the defense. His argument contin
ued until nearly 5 p. m. and will be re
sumed at 10 a. m. to-morrow. More
house's argument is that legislators are
not infrequently bought and sold with
out their knowledge. He said a shrewd
lobbyist finds out how legislators
stand, goes to parties in interest and
offers for a given sum to secure the leg
islative votes. This he does adroitly by
being seen in close converse with the
legislator to be handled and then to'l
ing the victim what it will cost to
the vote of the man, when, in fact. ,
legislator may be incorruptible Un
applied this theory to Jordan.
Chief Justice Beatty of the Supreme
Court yesterday denied the application
of former Senators Frank Fronch, Eli
Wright. E. J. Emmons and Harry
Bunkers for a writ of error against
the Supreme Court. George D. Collin3,
attorney for the accused, asked for the
writ on the ground that the Supreme
Court erred in deciding: on the appli
cation of section 1 of the fourteenth
amendment of the constitution when
the ex-Senators appealed to the court
for a writ of mandate to compel the
Senate to reinstate them.
At the time the court heard argu
ment on the writ of mandate it was
argued by Collins that the four bood
lers were dismissed from the Senate
without notice and that opportunity
for a hearing was denied them. Chief
Justice Beatty stated that the Legisla
ture held its own authority.

SEEKS RICHES
OF HIS DREAMS
Selma Man While in a Hyp
notic Trance Has Vision
of Fabulously Rich Mine
SEARCHING FOR WEALTH
Capitalists Furnish Him
With Funds to Go to Mexi
co to Find the Treasure
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SELMA, April 27.â J. M. Lowe, a
young mining expert from this, city, Is
In Old Mexico courting death at the
hands of hostile Indians. He Is
searching for a vien of gold of fabu
lous richness that was revealed to him
while in a hypnotic trance. The search
has been going on for two months past
and Lowe is freely supplied with funds
by local capitalists who are confident
that he will strike something good
through this new and somewhat unique
experiment. In Lowe's hypnotic trance
he not only located a rich mine, but
got the name of a hamlet near which
the hidden treasure is located. He
writes that so far in his journey, which
is into the most remote part c-f the
State of Sinsloa, the vision has been
confirmed and he has found that the
name of the hamlet secured In a
psychic way is correct. His journey
has met with many delays and several
times Indians on the warpath have
stopped his progress through their
country. However, he has sought only
temporary safety and pushed on to the
goal to satisfy himself and his backers
that the gold of his hypnotic dream is
indeed a reality.
The experiment of putting a man into
a hypnotic trance and then sending him
to look tor sold heretofore has not
been regarded as practical, but experts
in this art have held that such a feat
was theoretically possible.
Lowe, some time ago, was found to
be a fine hypnotic subject, and in ex
periments with him in this condition it
was discovered that he could be placed
into the deeper stages of hypnosis. A
number of times his ability to diagnose
conditions was tested and after com
ing out from these deep trances he re
counted tales of a marvelously rich de
posit of gold which Hashed across his
vision at a certain point in his passage
to and irom consciousness.
The story at first was regarded as an
idle trick of the imagination, but when
certain tests were applied it was dem
onstrated to those who investigated
that there was something to his story.
One of the heavy stockholders in a
company organized to send Lowe to
Mexico was given information as to
certain conditions of a private nature
that prevailed in Colorado. This man
visited Colorado in haste to find if
Lowe's information secured so mysteri
ously was correct, and found it to be
true.
Lowe was placed in profound hyp
nosis several times before starting in
order to impress upon his mentality the
exact spot where he wished to go, and
although the distance is some 2000 miles
away, his backers' feel confident that
he will go unerringly to the cache of
golden metal which is awaiting his
coming. So confident are his financial
supporters that the shares originally
sdfd for $20 are no* quoted at $150,
with no one willing to part with them.
ACCUSED SECRETARY
FAILS TO FIND BONDSMEN
Denies That He Embezzled the Funds
of the San Jose Chamber
of Commerce.
Commerce had his bail reduced to*day
from JIo.OOO to SioOO. He was ar
raigned before Justice Benson this
morning on the charge of embezzling
$9 01 and his examination set for next
Tuesday.
At a meeting of the board of con
trol of the chamber this morning the
office of secretary was declared vacant
and W. H. Stacey, who is experting the
books, was elected temporary secre
tary. It Is now certain that the short
age will exceed the $1500 which has
already been uncovered.
McMahill says the Chamber of Com
merce owes him $3300, being 15 per
cent of the amount of collections. He
declares he will have no trouble free-
Ing himself of the charge of embez
zlement made.
The members of the Chamber of
Commerce declare that there was no
agreement by which the secretary was
to have 15 per cent of the collections.
When he was first employed he was
guaranteed 15 per cent of the collec
tions or $60 per month, but when his
salary was raised to $100 per month
the commission was abolished.

WOMAN KILLED
FOR HER MONEY
EUREKA. April 27.â Mrs. Patrick
Quinn, aged 50 years, was murdered
during Wednesday night in her home
In this city. Her home was discovered
on fire about 5 o'clock this morning
and after the flames had been extin
guished Mrs. Quinn was found dead
under a door, which had burned at the
hi^ops and fallen down.
The autopsy physician was sum
moned and alter an examination of the
body reported that the skull was frac
tured and that there were several knffe
wounds in the neck. He further stated
that each of the wounds would have
caused death.
Mrs. Quinn is known to have kept a
large sum of money in her possession
and it is believed that some one aware
of the fact entered the house early this
morning and killed her in an attempt
to secure her wealth. Mrs. Quinn had
had many quarrels with her husband
and they separated many times, the
last separation taking place In San
Francisco, where they conducted a
boarding-house and saloon. Quinn is
now in San Francisco.
Town Talk.
The clerical habit of denouncing smart
society is discussed entertainingly in this
weeks issue; also, the trials and tribula
tions of the Grand Jury's foreman, who
deals in cameras and has a dread of
them. Interesting incidents in the lives
of the Hellmans and other local kings of
finance are recited in an illustrated arti
cle by Theodore Bonnet. Harry Cowell
gives his impression of Ivan Turgenev.
the greatest of Russian writers. The
Saunterer's columns abound as usual in
personalities of live interest. The story
of the tragic end of the erstwhile fiance
of a local heiress is told. A society god
dess Is the subject of exploitation. There
are several interesting paragraphs anent
the coming of the Goulds and touchtng
the inside of the Western Pacific deal.
Philistines in the Browning Club, Sausa
lito's modest blushes, a note of discord
in the arrangements for a fashionable
Oakland wedding, why Lukens is In
censed against Pardee. and how Newhall
advocates municipal ownership ar^ some
of the items of interest. Town Talk cov
ers a broad field, broader, perhaps, than
that of any other magazine.

Â»rf two distinct and separate affairs.
Seven hundred children from the
grammar grades and 300 from the pri
. (lasses of the Berkeley schools
WiU join in giving this unique enter
tainment for the benefit of the piano

A special feature of the programme
â will be the rhythmic songs and plays
by the primary children. including:
selections from the opera. The House
That Jack Built." and other well
known Mother Goose melodies, with
graceful, appropriate gestures.
The children have seen splendidly
drilled and songs and motions swing
together with marvelous accord. M:>.
L. V. Sweery. supervisor of music in
the Berkeley public schools, has the
entire affair in charge, and. although
'many of the other teachers have ren
dered valuable assistance, she alone is
directing the final rehearsals. During
& recent visit Eaet Mrs. Sweezy picked
up many new ideas along the line of
work she ie so successfully doing in
Berkeley. It if no light task to train
1000 children to sing and move in har
Â»nony, but the rehearsals bespeak
marked success for Mrs. Sweezy in

sentence and about to have been tried
again on a murder charge, committed

organized with sections and deluged with lec
tures and courses of a hlgnly scholarly trend,
v.-oulfi remind thi'm too much of school, and
university and sull-n professors. Besides, men
and women in French society are not tccu*
tomed to separate meetings. They join to-
Kfther, either for pleasure or instruction.
Therefore, instead of clubs, we find in Paris a
few salons. In which literary men. connoisseurs
and, generally speaking, appreciative gentle
men and ladies are welcomed and entertained.
The development of such salons is a part of
the history of the French literature. Their ac
tivities were unreasonable and ridiculous some
times, as we can see in Les Femmei Savantes
or Les Precleuses Ridicules of Moliere, but
upon the whole they helped in training up the
literary taste of the nation. In the eighteenth
century, principally, such salons as those of
Madame dv Defrand, Mademoiselle de Leapl
naese and Madame Geoffrln possessed great In
fluence over contemporary literature.
But all along through the nineteenth cen
tury their influence declined progressively. We
see in ' L.'lmmortel," a novel of Alphonse Daudet,
published In 1880, that twenty -fly* years ago
they were not doing anything but intriguing
and caballing In favor or some literary men
against some others, making and unmaking
academicians. And. few y^ars later. In "Le
Monde ou Ton s'ennule," tne comedy written
In 1891 by Edouard Pallleron. we can observe
a new tumble of French literary salons and
their caricatural imitation of French society.
However, in the contemporary Paris there
are still many literary salons left as Illustrious
Â»nd Ineffective, bright and useless, survivors
(ft the glorious past. The house of Princes*
Mathilde. who died recently, was the mest
famous of all those In whicn the literary men
wore given an intelligent hospitality. At the
present time we can mention the salons of
Mwtilamt'S Tain<N Juliette Adam. Countess
Oreffulhe, Viscountess Mathieu de Noaillee,
and also ttaote of Prince Blbesco and Count
Robert de Montesqulon-Fezensac, who gave a
tour of lectures In America a few days ago. â¢
But too mpny salons stood In competition, so
that they neutralised each other. In front of
them, against them, new groups and new ln
lluences rose up; literary circles which do not
concert with society people any longer; literary
critics whose criticisms bring success or failure
to tho books; increase of literary Industrialism,
which, by means of announcements and puffs,
widens tha circle of readers and quickly with
draws all literary lnfluenoo from the narrow
Bets. Moreover, the contemporary writers do
not cars so much as their predecessors for
feminine suffrage, and one after another desert
the literary salons.
Therefore, salons nowadays, Instead of pre
siding over literary activities of our time and
possessing Influence over the minds of the writ
ers give themselves to trlllea and divert them
belves with childish or complicated amuse
ments. The hostesses of such salons are no
long?r ladies of a good literary taste, but sim
ply leaders of snob, liking eccentricity more
than originality.
Mr. Dupouey gave a detailed exam
ple of this style of salon by describing
a salon he knew personally, the salon
of Mme. Jane Dieulafoy. He described
the lady hostess, her husband, the sort
of people with whom they were ac
quainted and how they were accus
tomed to amuse themselves in their
weekly meetings with society .plays
composed by themselves. The speaker
concluded his address by saying that
the literary men cannot get anything
by being frequent guests of such sa
lons but "occasional doubtful good for
tune and humiliations that are far
more certain."

OAKLAND, April 27.â Charles Lamb,
secretary and treasurer of Lumber
Handlers' and Talleymen's Union No.
225, is an embezzler of $400 of the

They See Strange Objects
OAKLAND, April 27.â A father and
mother filled with fear and queer
imaginings were taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital to-day and placed in the
Insane ward. It is charged that both
are afflicted with suicidal insanity, and
both fear invisible enemies. They are
Joseph and Marie Sousa. They have
three little children, who have been
brought in from the dairy ranch,
where they have been living, near Orln
da Park, in Contra Costa County. The
parents had a lucrative business. The
children are now in charge of Dr. M.
M. Enos.
Sousa is 45 years old and his wife is
I 38. Their eldest child is 12 years of
age. The peculiar phase of the case of
both husband and wife being affected
similarly has interested the physicians,
who are at a loss to account for their
condition, except on the theory that
one has infected the other. Sousa says
his enemies have cast a spell over him,
he sees strange objects, and his wife
agrees with him. Their farm yields an
Income of $200 a month. Edward Row-
I land, a neighbor, has askÂ«d the courts
for letters of guardianship on the chil

S&ecial Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY. April 27. â The
Redwocd City Water Company has ap
pealed to the City Council to be re
leased from its contract to supply the
town with water at the rates now in
force. George C. Ross, representing
the corporation, has asked the Coan
cll to cancel the existing contract and
enter into a new one. by which the
water company may make a reason
able return upon its investment and
provide certain improvements now
deemed necessary to secure a greater
supply of water.
For two years the Redwood City
Water Company has supplied 1 the town
with water at a rate of 7 cents a thoa
sand gallons. The company's plant
cost something more than ?T2,000. and
Ross Insists that the city does not pay
enough to warrant a just return upon
the investment. He asks, therefor^,
that the present contract be relin
quished and that a nÂ«w rat* of 10
cents be established.
The company, he says, must expeni
at least $3000 in the improvement el
its works to meet a rapidly increas
ing demand for water. New
must be sunk and certain machinery
must be purchased to insure the city
an adequate and wholesome supply
Members of the City Council declare
that even if the increased rate wer<*
established the Redwood City Water
Company has riven no assurance that
it will be better able to supply Re-1
wood with water than it is at the
present. This doubt exists in conne,
tion with the opinion that the Sprln<
Valley Water Company can supp!
water at the rate demanded by t K
cal corporation
Ross declares that the Spring Val
ley cannot undertake the task, and if:
the town officials win act fairly in the
matter the local corporation can ex
ploit several advantages it possesses
and be able to give the town all thÂ«
water it requires.
The matter has been taken under ad
visement by the City Council.

Scores a Big Hit
With an Old-
Time Piau.
Gives Brilliant
Production at
University.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 27.
The Stanford English Club has again
shown, by the performance of Ben
Jonaon's "Every Man in His Humour,"
that there were other playwrights in
Shakespeare's time whose comedies
deserve to be remembered. The com
edy moves straight ahead in a busl
neas-llke sort of way. It is a play
without a hero, made for an "all-star
cast," and the director of the Stanford
performance, Emerson Bassett, was
obliged to find or make not one or two,
but about a dozen first-rate actors in
ordej to make it go as It did go to
night
Tfce Eliaabethan stagre built at Stan
ford has already become famous by
fc^ving been used, not only two years
ago, but more recently by Ben Greet
in his production of "Hamlet." It was
startling to the unprepared part of the
audience, on entering the assembly
hall to-night, to see the galleries, boxes
and tower of the old English theater,
with the old English flag flying over it.
A trumpeter blew three blasts from
his horn, according to the old fashion,
ac a sign that the play was about to
begin, and the galleries filled up with
a real KlUMtbethan audience â so far as
could be judg-ed from their appearance.
Ttie color scheme of the costumes of
both audience and cast, as worked out
under the direction of Miss C. Z. Ed
wards, was a notable part of the whole
performance.
The two most famous pert* in "Ev
Â«>ry Man in His Humour" are those of
Kitely, the jealous old husband, and
Bobadil, the coward-captain â a near
relative of Falstaff. The first of these
was taken by R. G. Baxnett, 05, who
recently appeared as a victorious de
bater in Stanford's behalf, and last
night showed no less ability in a part
of a somewhat tragic cast.
The honors of Captain Bobadil wpre
well maintained by J. K. Bonnell of the
English department of the Stanford
faculty, who made a hit while still a
student two years ago in the part of
the grocer's wife in the "Knight of the
Burning Pestle."
Another comic part was cleverly
taken by P. C. Edwards, '06. who as
<^ob the Water Carrier sent a breeze of
laughter over the audience whenever
he appeared on the stage.
The other parts worthy of special
mention were that of the merry Justice
Clement, taken by E. O. James, a Stan
ford graduate, who made a reputation
in the play of two years ago which he
well maintained in this one; that of
hew. the foolish poet, which was
n.o^t entertainingly interpreted by L.
W. Cutler. "06; and Brainworm, the
r lever servant, wbose part exacted and
received skillful treatment at the
hands of R, H. Baker. '08. Jonson was
not a pallant dramatist, and the fe
male parts in the comedy were slight,
but they also were well played. Miss E.
L. Buckingham, '08. showing a particu
lar amount of vivacious intelligence in
h*Â»r representation of Tib.
The play is to be repeated on Satur
day at 10:30 o'clock for the special
benefit of out of town patrons.

MRS. YOUNG
CONFRONTS
HER RIVAL
NEW YORK, April 27.â While there
were no features as sensational as yes
terday's, the trial of "Nan" Patterson,
charged with the shooting of Caesar
Young, was fully as interesting to-day
in th<> many points brought out. Mis.
Margare. Young, widow of "Caesar"
Young, was on the stand and as she
testified her eyes would fill with tears.
"Nan" Patterson dropped her eyes
when she saw the widow and did not
raise them again until recess.
Josiah DT" Millin, Young's partner,
was another witness, and told of the
relations between Young and "Nan"
Patterson.
The letter that Mrs. Morgan Smith.
sister of the defendant, wrote to "Caes
ar" loung, in which she said Miss
Patterson was "frantic," and which
v.as admitted at the previous trial,
was also ruled out. The conspiracy
charge against the Smiths was based
upen the letter.
EXPE(TEU TO MARRY YOUNG.
Mrs. J. Morgan Smith was called and
told of her visit to California in the
spring of 1903, where she saw her sis
ter and Young together. A year later,
when Mrs. Smith saw Miss Patterson
in New York, she found her in a high
ly nervous condition. She was hysteri
cal and crying and appeared to be la
boring under a nervous strain and "al
most frantic."
Mrs. Smith told of Miss Patterson's
expectation of marrying Young; that
Miss Patterson secured a divorce with
such a purpose in mind and the ar
rarsement with Young was postponed
because of influence brought tv bear
on Young by his wife and partner.
On May 1. 1904, Leslie Coggins of
San Francisco, a friend of Young,
dined with Mrs. Smith at her house and
told Mrs. Smith that Young was com
ing to New York. Coggins said Young
was not going to marry Miss Patter
son. When Mrs. Smith told this to her
lister she became "frantic and per
turbed." Mrs. Smith continued:
â¢She said that "Caesar" could not fool
her that vajl It was impossible for
him to do such a thing. "
The relations of Cogglns with Miss
Patterson were brought c-ut when Mrs.
Smith said: "He told me he wanted to
marry 'Nan.' "
Mrs. Margaret Young, the widow of
thn d*ad bookmaker, went on the stand
this afternoon. She testified that her
husband never had owned a revolver.

but that she had c-ne and that she
packed It away with a box ef car
tridges in her baggage when she was
preparing to go to Europe, just before
her husband was killed. The revolver
v.as loaded when she put it into the
suit case a year ago and the cartridges
still remain in the chambers. She
identified the weapon, which was dis
charged, to her knowledge, she said,
when she fired several shots at a
burglar.
When the revolver was found in
â young's baggage soc-n after the end of
the last trial, counsel for the defense
claimed thai it proved conclusively that
witnesses had test ; Tied to that which
was not true when they said Young
had not owned a revolver.
Mrs. Young said she was married in
1898 and made her home in California.
It was her custom to accompany her
husband to the racetrack and co-nduct
business for him. che saw "Nan"
Patt at the tracks several times
in 1903 and 1904 and at that time knew
of the relations between the young wo
man and her husband. When she first
learned that Young and Miss Patterson
were intimate, her marriage relations
with her husband were discontinued
and there was no reconciliation until
after May 26 of last year, when they
went to live at Sheepshead Bay. Her
husband was in a happy frame of mind
at that lime, she said, and spoke of
his plans fc-r the future. After they
had talked over the proposed Euro
pean trip he engaged passage on the
steamship Gennank-. She accompanied
him from Sheepshead Bay to the Luce
home on June 3 and that evening they
had a party at which her four" sisters
were present. Just before midnight
Young escorted some of the ladies to
the cars and then he and Luce went
out and did not return until 3 o'clock
in the morning. Before Young arose
that morning he needed some money to
pay an expressman and searched his
pocket. She v.as positive that he did
not have a revolver.
RACING PARTNER'S STORY.

t<i Young's stableman at San Fran
cisco. The letter contained instruc
tions regarding the care of two horses
and said that Young was about to sail
for Europe. It also gave his London
address. Millin also identified letters
written by Young to Miss Patterson.
Millin was at the Gravesend race
track on June 3 and saw Miss Patter
son there, but did not see J. Morgan
Smith. He. returned to New York and
Mr. and Mrs. Young called upon them
that evening at the Luce home in
Harlem.
LETTER TO LESLIE OOGGINS.
A letter which had not made its ap
pearance heretofore was produueed by
Rand. The witness identified the let
ter, which, he . said, was received by
Leslie Coggins In San Francisco in
April, 1904.
Corgins gave the letter to Millin in
May, 1904. The letter waa written by
"Nan" Patterson, but bore no date.
The prosecuting attorney said he de
sired to Introduce the letter In evidence
to show that the, defendant correspond
ed with other men during the period of
' her relations with Young, and thus
'prove that those relations were of a
mercenary character. As the date could
not be positively fixed, however, trie
letter was ruled out by Recorder Goff
on Levy's objection.
The letter was signed "Cry Baby,"
was addressed to "Dearest" and asked
that the recipient send A real long
note, because they do cheer me up,"
and to return the "Cry Baby" note
with it. It also said that "V" was
coming to see the writer the next
morning.
CLAIMS SHE SAW THE TRAGEDY.
Woman Asserts That Young Had a
Revolver While in Cab.
NEW YORK, April 27. â Another
person has come forward through the
newspapers with a story of having
seen "Nan" Patterson and "Caesar "
Young a moment before the book
maker met his death on June 4 last
in a cab on West Broadway. The new
witness is Mrs. Fannie Shapiros, wife
of an East Side dentist. She claims
to have been within a few feet of the
cab and asserts that Young had a re
volver in his right hand, which the
woman at his side was trying to tear
from his grasp. As the cab passed
her, Mrs. Shapiro says, the man start
ed to rise from his seat. A second or
two later she heard a shot. Several
persons ran toward the cab and the
dentist's wife hurried from the scene.
"THE ETERNAL FEMININE" TO
CONTINUE AT THE CALIFORNIA
Margaret Anjrlhi's Phenomenal Sue-
cess Makes Extra Perform
ances Imperative.
Margaret Anarlin's portrayal of the
Queen in "The Eternal Feminine" at
the California this week has created
such a furor that the piece will be
continued for several performances
next week and possibly throughout
the entire week. Miss Anglin's art
and versatility as exhibited in "The
Eternal Femfnine," together with the
delightful novelty of the play, have
aroused as much interest among the
ater-goers as any other dramatic hap
pening of the season.
The play to follow "The Eternal
Feminine" will be the great emo
tional drama, "Mariana," by the cele
brated Spanish playwright, Jose
Echagarey, adapted in English by
Desmond O'Hara, the noted Irish au
thor. The piece offers Miss Anglin
unlimited opportunities for some very
strong emotional work and promises
to more than duplicate the "Zira" suc
cess. Mrs. Patrick Campbell scored a
big hit in "Mariana" in London last
season, but this will be the first Amer
ican production of the piece. The title
role, to be played by Miss Anglin, is
that of a high-bred Castllian whose life
is colored and directed capriciously
and tragically by a wrong done her
mother when Mariana was a child.
Press Club Hoi 'ls Hlerh Jinks.
Members of the Press Club and
their friends assembled last night for
the annual high Jinks. About 400 per
sons enjoyed an evening of song,
story and Jest till a late hour. Among
the members who contributed to the
night's entertainment were Nat Lands
berger and his wife, who played Wie
niawski's "Lejrende" and Drolla's
"Serenade," and Miss Helen Heath,
who sang the "Jewel Song" from
"Faust" and "Twickenham Ferry."
Captain W. S. Barnes was sire, and
Julius Mersfelder was chairman of the
entertainment committee. After the
programme, which was quite informal,
had been completed the club enter
tained its guests at a supper.

FLEETS OFF
KAMRANH BAY
Kojestvensky's Vessels Ap
parently Awaiting Arrival
of Admiral Nebogatoff
JUNCTION IS ASSURED
Two Divisions Are Expected
to Combine in Tonquin
Bay About the Fifth of May
KAMRANH BAY, April 27.â The only
ships remaining in Kamranh Bay are
four German transports. All the rest
of the transports and the Russian hos
pital ship Orel and ether vessels left
behind by Admiral Rojestvensky left
the bay yesterday morning. This fleet
is now assembled outside the bay and
forms an extended line stretching from
Cape Vare'a to the head of Kamranh
Peninsula. Torpedo boats are scout
ing in all directions. The ships seem
to be awaiting Vice Admiral Neboga
toff's division.
The two freight-laden steamships
captured by Admiral Rojestvensky
were under the German flag. It is pre
sumed that they are suspected of hav
ing contraband of war on board.
TOKIO, April 27.â The movements
and intentions of Rear Admiral Rojest
vensky continue the subject of gen
eral Interest and speculation here. It
is evidently the intention of Admiral
Rojestvensky to await a junction with
the Third Division, under Rear Ad
miral Nebcgatoff, when he will give
Vice Admiral Togo a decisive battle.
It is assumed that Admiral Rojest
vensky will bring all the ships and
guns he possibly can into action if he
intends to make a decisive fight or will
detach and abandon the slow, cumber
some and useless ships if he intends
to run the gauntlet for Vladivostok,
which is believed to be his ultimate
destination.
The date of the coming conflict will
depend entirely upon Admiral Ro
jestvensky. The Japanese will act
upon the defensive, their plan of ac
tion being concealed with absolute se
crecy.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 27.âAc
cording to the calculations of the
naval staff Vice Admiral Nebogatoff,
who left Jibutil, French Somaliland,
on March 25, if he has been making 200
knots per day, should reach Singa
pore to-morrow and could not unite his
division with Vice Admiral Rojest
vensky in Tonquin Bay until May 5.
The general opinion is that their junc
ture is assured, on the theory that Ad
miral Togo would not dare to risk sail
ing south to meet Nebogatoff, since by
so doing he would leave the way to
Vladivostok open to Rojestvensky.
KOZLOFF AGAIN IN POWER.
Foe of Terrorists Becomes Moscow's
Governor General.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 27.â
The post of Governor General of Mos
cow, which was temporarily abolished
on January IC, has been re-establish
ed by imperial decree and General
Kozloff, former chief of the Moscow
police, has been appointed Governor
General of that city. The administra
tive control of the police remains in
the hands of General Wolkoff, who
was appointed Prefect in January, but
the police will be under the general
supervision of the Governor General.
Kozloff's appointment as Governor
General of Moscow upon the eve of
the anticipated troubles at Easter and
on Mayday, although accompanied by
speaks of the "great Interior re
speakes of the "great interior re
forms" contemplated by him. leaves no
doubt of his purpose first to restore
tranquillity v.'ith a firm hand. Koz
loff distinguished himself during the
nihilist conspiracies twenty-five years
age by hunting down conspirators,
which resulted in an attempt upon his
life.

SLAVS DREAD
THEIR EASTER
ST. PETERSBURG. April 27.â A feel
ing akin to consternation has been
caused by the publication in this morn
ing's papers of renewed rumors of an
impending popular outbreak. It is
feared that the slightest event inci
dental to malevolence among the vast
congregations which will attend the
churches on Saturday night may cause
a panic, with appalling consequences.
Elaborate preparations to crush any
possible disorder in its Incipiency had
been taken and the Chief of Police to
day issued an order instituting the
most stringent regulations for the pe
riod between April 29 and May 8.
The dvorniks, or house porters, have
been ordered to remain on duty
through the twenty-four hours and
have been instructed to search the
stairways and courts of residents peri
odically, keep the court gates closed
and Scrutinize with especial strictness
all persons entering the buildings.
Gatherings in the streets are prohibited
Japanese have decided not to await
the issue of the impending naval con
test, but to utilize the few weeks in
tervening between the drying up of
the thawed-out roads and the arrival
of the summer rains in June for the
resumption of the land campaign.
The completion of the railway to Muk

THE LEWIS AND CLARK EXPOSITION.
OUR neighbors in Portland have prepared the companion ex
position to that celebrating the Louisiana purchase at St.
Louis. The cession of Louisiana and the exploring expedi
tion to the mouth of the Columbia River, conducted by Lewis, the
nephew of Washington, and Clark, the brother of General George
Rogers Clark, are event* in our continental history of the first
magnitude. The greatness of the territory ceded and of that ex
plored is familiar to us now. It is traversed by railroads, dotted
with towns and cities, teeming with population, all the result of
great policy and foresight by our forefathers. In their day it was
nearly all unknown country, wild and mysterious, inhabited by
many Indian tribes, and believed by many white men to be un
adapted to the needs and uses of civilization. The first explorers
entered upon a hard task, and its faithful and useful performance
remains high among the heroic deeds of man.
It is a mistake to suppose that it interested only the people
of this country. Geographers and men of science and affairs in
Europe gave it equal attention. The first publication of a journal
of the expedition was made in London during our last war with
Great Britain, and the editor took occasion to praise without stint
the work done for mankind by its intrepid leaders, and to regret
that one of them had fallen "in the present unhappy war."
It is not well for men to forget the struggles and trials of brave
spirits in preceding generations. It is all woven into the character
of the generation that is. The wild tribes through which Lewis
and Clark made their way have dwindled to a few thousands of
subdued and peaceful red folk, tenants by sufferance of the territory i
over which their ancestors held sway undisturbed. The white man ]
dominates it all, the beneficiary of an exploration the most signifi- I
cant ever undertaken on land or sea, excepting only that voyage of
discovery by the Genoese which disclosed the new world to the old. j
The people of Portland have set for themselves the task of i
honoring the memory of those hardy adventurers, at the same time
putting before the eye of the world evidence of what has been done
to make of that wild west the abiding place for civilized man. We,
living on soil that belonged to the boasted empire of Philip while
Lewis and Clark were feeling their way among the wild tribes, have
something more than a neighborly interest in the event which invites |
our presence and support. Had it not been for the uncertainty that ;
shadowed the southwestern boundary of the Louisiana purchase,
whose northwesterly extension Lewis and Clark explored, California
might yet be soil alien to the United States.
hen Ronaparte was reminded of the uncertainty of that boun
dary he said: "If there were no uncertainty about the boundary,
we would have to create an uncertainty." This revealed the re
markable quality of that warrior and statesman. An uncertain
boundary meant the future possibility of changes in political geog- j
lapliy. The changes came, and the uncertainty which did not have
io be created caused the Mexican war and the cession of that vast ,
territory <>f which California is the jewel.
being linked historically with the events celebrated at
Portland. California will be there in force. Already our producers )
have perfected arrangements to make there a complete exhibit of
our resources and production. A State commission is in action and ;
will make a splendid collective exhibit of everything given up by j
tfie gtnerosit) of our so 9 and climate, of our waters, forests and
inim r manufactures and our institutions.
. and the great Northwest are of special interest to '
California. As the years go by and interests and population multi- ;
ply here and in that vast region, the enterprise wrought upon it all
will be commercially complementary, and the prosperity of any part j
erf it will make for the prosperity of all. The mountain barrier that !
divides as \va^ crossed by a railroad built by California capital and ;
enterprise, because we so highly esteemed the benefits of access to '
our neighboring State. That highway of commerce will all this
smtuner be a pathway over which thousands will pass to the expo- |
vition to testify their neighborly and patriotic interest, and at the
f-ame time spread abroad knowledge of the resources of California, j
In addition to the collective effort of the State commission, our j
counties are organized to introduce themselves and spread
knowledge of their special advantages where tens of thousands
will -
-tland is a city of many attractions and is set in the midst
nerv that is worth a pilgrimage to see. The people are hos
nitaKle and full of enterprise. If Lewis and Clark could have looked j
ahead a century they would have wished that their work woSild lead j
Ub such results as will be testified at this exposition, and would have j
desired no better memorial.
The officials who will have charge of California's interests there ;
speak in high praise of the facilities given them by the officials of
the exposition, and they note also the great expectations that center
in the exhibit we are to make. All this is a call that should rouse
the enterprise of California. Thousands who visit Portland, seeing
California there in her fruits, ores, crops and minerals, will be
moved to take the fine scenic trip and come here to see the State j
that can show such a variety of resources. We will help ourselves ,
by helping our neighbor, and there will be no lack of effort to such
J ends.
ANOTHER DEFALCATION.
THE defalcation of the Tax Collector of this city is another loud
call to thr Republican League, demonstrating the absolute ne
cessity for the exercise of the keenest vigilance in the selection
of csnHiHar<Â»Â« for the public trusts and responsibilities.
A wav? of official and private dishonesty is passing over the
country like an epidemic. Public officers and fiduciary trustees are
falling everywhere. San Francisco is not alone. Who shall deny
the need of the sternest judgment on all candidates for office?
This city has one Treasurer recently in the penitentiary, two Sena
tors indicted for bribery, two ballot-box corrupters serving sen
tence, the president of the Board of Worlds under indictment, and
a thieving Tax Collector on the run with the police in full cry be
hind him. It is time for the people to pay attention to the condi
tion of local politics and insist upon good character and high
principles as a qualification for office. What is exposed we know,
and it is enough to appeal to the energy and vigilance of every high
minded citizen. What other official rascals there may be unexposed
we know not. but d<->ubt]eÂ«s there are many whose exposure may
come at any moment.
The Republican League was organised nrni* 1 too soon. Tt will
bf as permanent a* the recurrence of the conditions it will reform.
Wltfc such a body, alert and watchful of men in office, an officer
will not be permitted to continue in office after stealing $165,000, as
the late Tax Collector did. It is in order now for the league to
find out what other responsible city officials knew of that first em
*Â»ment. It is a most extraordinary state of things and condi
tion of official morals that a public officer, handling millions of the
money of taxpayers, is permitted to retain his office after an enor
mous embezzlement, and thus get the opportunity to steal some
more.
This offense enlarges the functions of the Republican League
and makes its permanence necessary to do the work of policing the
official morals of those in authority.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 1903.
GET CLOSE TO SPRING
Angela Morgan
Get close to the spring. Don't
miss the healing and regeneration
that exist for you In the renewing In
fluences of this wonderful season.
Just as the physical world about
you 'Is at this time bemg rejuvenated
and made glad by these Influences, so
may you. If you will but vibrate In
harmony with the spirit of spring,
realize a definite renovation of your
entire being.
There Is no reason why the earth
should receive the real benefits of the
springtime and humanity fall to ap
propriate them. Everything thrills
and stirs and wakens in response to
the summons. Why should not human
beings by a like response appropriate
the most vital good of the season for
the recreation of mind and body?
It is my belief Jhat people gener
ally do not appropriate this good. Hu
manity is prone to consider its aging,
decaying tendencies Instead of looking
for the possibility of reconstruction
within itself.
It is natural for us to believe
the earth should be renewed, but
we are so accustomed to thinking of
ourselves as subject to laws of decay
and age that we do not accept the re
generation that is ours.
Why should "every clod feel a stir
of might, an instinct within it that
reaches and towers," while human
creatures â conscious, thinking souls â â 
talk of disease and declining powers?
If human beings could Just push
away their doubts and fears and bogy
beliefs about themselves and really
lÂ«t nature have her perfect way with
them, it would soon be seen that the
lack of vitality and decline are never
her fault.
Nature can do no more for man
than he will permit. The renewing
can come to him only in the degree
that he opens himself to it. Man, as
a conscious being, must consciously
co-operate with nature in her efforts
to rebuild him. Certainly nature can
do little for him when his thought Is
working in opposition.
Scientists to-day are waking to the
significance of the self-regulative ten
dencies In living organisms, and
particularly to the regenerative faculty
which the human body possesses. Dr.
R. H. France of the University of Ber
lin, in an article on the subject, de
clares such phenomena to be among
the most wonderful problems of mod
ern biology.
Who knows to what extent this fac
ulty would show Itself in man, did ha
not Interfere with the process by his
own erroneous beliefs? Our doubts,
our disappointments, our distlluelon
ments and our cynicism bar the way,
obstruct the channels through which
restoration might come to us. If
man's mentality offered no obstructions
who knows what transformation might
be wrought in him?
Get close to the spring. Banish
your fears and false beliefs. When
you go out into the parks or into the
country and see the green and gold
abuot you, don't simply say, "How
lovely!" and ihlnk wistfully of your
youth. Real'.ze that you have Just as
much right to the healing and the
gladness of faring to-day as you ever
did. Know that nature is eager to re
invigorate you and transform you Just
as she is ready to transform the earth.
Let go of your troubles long enough
to take this in. Make a channel big
enough for the Influence to reach you.
Say definitely and positively: "This
health and beauty are for me. The
spring is for me. I take in all of its
power for good. The universal life
forces are working through me to re
new me."
No matter how "run down" and out
of sorts you feel, let go. Get close to
the spring. It isn't any harder, surely,
for her to perform your regeneration
than it was for her to release the cold
earth from the bondage of winter.
Decree that the spring shall mean
more to you this year than it has ever
meant before. There is an abundance
of life and health in its influence for
you. It rests with you to appropriate
these benefits.
NERVOUSTOWN.
Oh, there's never a noise in Nervous
town;
Not the cry of a youngster; and up or
down
There's never a cheer or a whistle shrill;
Just silence, like that of the grave, so
still:
The horses trot with a muffled tread.
But the place seems lonesome and drear
and dead,

able to return to
the arena and battle with renewed vigor for the cause
so near her heart. Mrs. Catt received her Â£rst arrest of
thought on the suffrage question about fifteen years ago,
when working as a reporter on a San Francisco daily
following the untimely death of her first husband, Leo
Chapman. For the first time she became acquainted
with the conditions of working women In cities, and
coon after determined to devote her life with whatever
gifts she possessed to the work of women's enfranchise
ment which she holds to be the best leverage for the im
provement of cond itions. She went upon the platform
with this object in view and soon became a distinguished
figure in the woman's rights movement.
Her home is in New York City, where she and Mr.
Catt, who warmly seconds his wife's public work, keep
open house for suffrage workers.

EXCITE CROWD
Another Supposed Gold Mine
Is Discovered at Beach
and Rush Sets In
VEIN IN SEWER TRENCH
contractor Says It Runs
in Line of Cut and Watches
Crowd Go for Shovels
*
Another gold mine has been discov
ered at the beach. It is not gold that
makes a mine at the beach, but ex
citement. The mine discovered yester
. day was a rich one â excitement
went two ounces to the pan.
James Daly made the discovery in a
deep eewer trench he was digging on
B street, between Forty-eighth and
Forty-ninth avenues, near Sutro
Heights. James . says he knows gold
When he sees it, for he has been dig
. sing trenches about town for years.
There is no doubt in his mind that
before another sun sets the people will
be pulling down all the Marshall monu
ments and shouting: the name of Jim
Daly. *
The man in the trench worked quietly
after his noon meal until he saw some
thing ay in ihe sands he was
â¦shoveling out. He examined it and
satislled himself it was gold. It didn't
take much to satisfy the hundreds of
others who came to view the find. Daly
says he don't know how they got the
news, but they all arrived. Gold beats
a street corner scrap as a card, he
says.
._ Shovelful after shovelful of the sand
was thrown out by Daly, and the glis
tening particles that it surely enough
contained were devoured by eyes as
greedy as those of a waif at a bakery
window.
Mark Twain has paraphrased the
saying, "All that glitters is not gold"
with the practical truth that "Nothing
that glitters is gold," but . Mark
Twain's wisdom couldn't dampen the
enthusiasm of Â«bat crowd. They had
the gold /ever, and Daly, down in the
trench, was working away without
even spitting on his hands, which
would have subjected him to a fine by
the union had he been observed, hope
ful of getting beyond the mere yellow
dust and turning over a solid chunk
of canary metal that he could carry
home in a sack without the trouble of
amalgamating. Men do get so careless
of small fortunes when big ones are in
eight. The boss watched Daly work
and jotted down $26 70 additional profit
on his contract that he had never ex
pected.
The boom grew as Daly shoveled, and
the Argonauts flocked in from the Cliff
House, the boulevard and oceanside. A
waffle man moved in and a mining
town was almost launched.
Â»lix McHugh, fearful of the pro
portions the rush would assume,
staked off a claim to protect the
n which the sewer was being
dug. Daly wanted to stake, too, but
M afraid if he left the trench he
Id pet off the mother lode.
tor McHuph. after consulta
h Daly, announced to the
d that the auriferous streak ran
b and south. That's also the di
n of the sewer trench. People
â¢>i off home to g-et shovels and dig:,
much to MeHug-h's satisfaction, on the
t ihe discovf-ry â No. 1.
Many gathered up the sand with its
ring burden in buckets and paper
and tried to buy cold ham and
. rs with it at thÂ» Grocer's, but he
had no gold scales.
: < Hugh took samples of
the sand to town and will have them
iiSsayed. Like Daly, he firmly believes
-l!ow contents are gold.

NEW YORK, April 27.â A gift of
$10,000,000 by Andrew Carnegie, to pro
vide annuities for college professors
who are not able to continue in act
ive service, was announced to-day by-
Frank A. Vanderlip, vice president of
the National City Bank of New York.
Professors in the United States, Can
ada and Newfoundland will share in
the distribution of the income fund.
United States Steel Corporation 5 per
cent first mortgage bond* for $10,
000,000 have been transferred to a
board of trustees.
Vanderlip to-day sent the following
to the press:
The purpose of the trust fund thus created
Is to provide, annuities for college professors In
the United States, Canada and Newfoundland,
who from old age or other physicai disability
are no longer In a position to render the moat
efficient service. It Is Mr. Carnegie's belief
that this fund will not only provide a diynined
pension system for a body of most worthy
aeir-sacrificlng and poorly paid m*n. but that
It will be of distinct value to the cause of ea
uca-tion In offering an opportunity to the trus
tees of a college to retire members of the fac
ulty who have faithfully served the Institution
for many years, and to replace such men. with
young, intelligent %jid efficient professors. I
am taking the liberty of IncloÃin* herewith
Mr. Carnegie's letter outlining the nature of
his bequest. This letter was written to tha
members of the board of trustees. The list of
trustees also Is Inclosed. All have accepted.
Carnegie's letter to the trustees is
dated April 18 and is as follows:
I have reached the conclusion that the least
rewarded of all the professions is that of the
teachers in our higher educational institutions.
New Yorli City generously, and very wisely,
provides retiring pensions for teachers In her
public schools and also for her policemen.
Very few, indeed, of our colleges are able to
do so The consequences are grievous. Able
men hesitate to adopt teaching as a career,
and many old professors whose places should
be occupied by younger men cannot be retired.
I have, therefore, transferred to you and
your successors, as= trufteaÃ. $10,000,000 5 per
cent first mortgage bonds of thÂ« United States j
Steel Corporation, the revenue from which is
to provide retiring pensions for the teachers I
of universities, colleges and techincal schools
in our own country. Canada and Newfound
land, under such conditions as you may adopt
from time to time. Expert calculations show
that the revenue will be ample for the purpose.
The fund applies to the three classes of In
stitutions named without regard to race, sex,
creed or color. We have, however, to recog
nize that State and colonial governments
which have established, or mainly support,
universities, colleges or schools, may prefer
that their relations shall remain exclusively
with the State. I cannot, therefore, presume
to Include them.
There Is another class which States do not
aid. their constitutions in some cases even
forbidding It, viz: Sectarian Institutions.
Many of these established long ago were truly
sectarian, but to-day are free; to all men of
all creeds or of none. Such are not to be con
sidered sectarian. Only such as are under con
trol of a sÂ«>ct or require trustee* (or a majority
thereof) officers faculty or students, to belong
to any specified sect, or which Imposes any
theological test, are to be excluded.
Trusteei; shall hold office five year* and be
eligible for re-election. The first trustees shall
draw lots for one, two, three, four or five
year terms, fo that one-fifth shall retire each
year.
Kach institution participating in the fund
shall cast onÂ« vote for trustee.
The trustees are hereby given full powers
to manage the trust In every respect, to fill
vacam-ies of non-ex-officlo members, appoint
executive committees, employ agents, change
securities and. generally speaking, to do all
things necessary in their judgment to insure
the most beneficial administration of the funds.
By a two-thirds vote they may, from time
to time, apply the revenues In a different man
n?r and for a different, though similar, pur
pose to that specified, should coming days bring
such changes as render this necessary In their
judgment to proiuce the best results possible
for the teachers and for education.
No trust?* shall Incur any legal liabilities
growing from his trusteeship. All traveling
and hot*"l expense? Incurred by trustees in the
performance of their duties shall be paid from
th* fund, the <?TpÂ»nses of wife or daughter ae
mn-.pariylng the trustees to th<> annual meeting*
Included.
. I hope this fund may do much for the cause
of higher education and 'â â  remove a. Boure* iof
d^p and constant. anxiety; to thÂ» poorest paid

HUNTING TRIP
IS CUT SHORT
GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo..
April 2 7. â Disappointment reigns in a
number of Colorado cities and towns
along the route of the President's re
turn trip to Washington because of
his determination to curtail his hunt
and start Jor home on May 8. While
all invitations extended to the Presi
dent to stop at various points not on
the schedule have been rejected by
Secretary Loeb, local organizations at
these towns hoped that some time
would be given them. The announce
ment of the plans which were made
by Loeb to-day carries with it the de
cision not to make any stops except at
Denver and Chicago.
There Is much speculation here as
to the President's reasons for advanc
ing the time of his departure from
Colorado.
Of the six bears killed by the hunt
ers thus far the President has brought
down three and Dr. Alexander Lam
bert the other three. Four bears have
been killed by temporary attaches of
the party and nearby ranchmen.
OLD "CLUBPOOT" RILLED.
Member of President's Party Slays the
Grizzly Patriarch,
NEWCASTLE, Colo., April 27.â
"Clubfoot," a grizzly that has been a
terror to small farmers and ranchmen
for a number of years, was killed last
night by Pred Tollens, a member of
the President's party. It had been
hoped by members of the party that
Mr. Roosevelt would Ket a chance at
this bear, but the animal was over
taken by the dogs and was playing
havoc with them when Tollens came
up. To save the hounds he was com
pelled to kill the grizzly.

On Sunday, April 30, the California North

LONG SHOTS IN BETTING PLAY HAVOC
WITH THE FOLLOWERS OF FORM.
C, Williams, Astride
Follow Me, Is
First Again.
Ralph Young Beat
en by Lucrece, an
Outsider.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Jockey C. Williams came a long way
to teach some of our fashionable riders
at Oakland the right way around a
â  racetrack. Williams is Just a modest
little "bush" rider from the mountains
of Colorado with no pretensions to
class, paying California a visit in com
pacy with his father.
On" Wednesday he landed Follow Me
first at odds of 30 to 1, and in the. first
mile selling event at Oakland yester
day put the gelding over the plate
again in front at odds of 12 to 1, Win
ning from a clever field of platers.
Williams' mount met with repeated
.interference during the early stages of
the race. The boy dexterously extricat
ed himself from the predicament and
made the so-called star riders look like
a band of sheepherders, winning almost
easily from the favorite, Edgecliff.
Follow Me ran practically unbacked.
* FOUNTAIN* RIDES CLEVERLY.
. it Is a pleasure to record the repeated
victories in the saddle of Lloyd Foun
tain. The riding of the Idaho boy was
the feature of the sport at Oakland.
He passed the* Judges ' astride three
winners, all Quoted at lengthy odds.
One can "bet on his mounts feeling that
he will receive a run for his money,
even though the horse does not al
vcays win.
Favorite players again met with a
severe setback, Flaunt alone taking a
purse.
Hu?an. a brother to Humo, carrying
the colors of Charley Patterson, made
his first start in the two-year-old dash
for maidens, and was the medium of a
plunge. He ran greenly, finishing un
; placed. Travers, astride the favorite,
Rey del Mundo. which was pounds the
best, met with all sorts of so-called
HI luck, ending in the show. Danger
ous Girl, a 15 to 1 chance, won, ridden
out from Midmont. . .
Warte Nicht. favorite for the seven
furlong event following, had a stormy
passage, being led out by Laura F. M..
aJso piloted by Fountain. Show honors
went to Hi Caul Cap, a 15 to 1 outsider.
Jackfull, the heavily backed second
choice, collided with another starter
right after the barrier went ud. throw
ing his rider.
FLAUNT WINS GALLOPING.
"iaunt was best of the
â¢tarterE in the mile and a sixteenth
selling affair. The aged gelding closed
favorite and defeated Possart in fast
time, merely galloping. Tannhauser at
20 to 1 ran third. Golden Ivy went
back in the hitting end her showine
indicated that no mistake was made.
There'll come a time some day when
J. V Klrby will run a race, posslblv.
The superb breadwinner of the Strobel
stable started favorite for the mile
selling number, and Travers rode him
Redmont, ridden by Lloyd Fountain,
overtook Hindoo Princess in the
stretch, beating the fatnt-hearted mare
without an effort. Circus was third
Next came a crash that startled the
turf world. Ralph Younp looked a
moral for the mile purse run. rulinjr a
" to 10 choice. Lucrece, a 12 to 1 shot
with "Crickef Kelly in the saddle
easily outfooted the odds-on choice,
ecoring l>y two lengths. Forest King
finished third.

WORTH GATES
TO BE CLOSED
Officials of Cook County
Bace Course Will Not
Defy the State's Attorney
MEETING IS ABANDONED
Washington Park, Harlem
and Hawthorne Managers
May Take Similar Action
Special Diicatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 27.â The managers
of Worth racetrack have bowed to the
decision of State's Attorney Healy, and
at a meeting of the board of directors
to-morrow the race meeting, scheduled
to be opened on Saturday will be for
mally called off.
In the opinion of racehorse men sim
ilar action will be taken by the direc
tors of Hawthorne and of Harlem
tracks and of the track at Washington
Park. The decision that will be
reached by the Worth officials to-mor
row will probably mean the sealing of
the doom of racing in Chicago this sea
son.
Among the more enthusiastic race
horse owners and bookmakers in the
city there w;as a hope that the Worth
officials would make some effort to
circumvent the decision of the State's
Attorney. However these hopes may
have been bolstered up during the
earlier stages of the fight they were
blasted to-day by the statement issued
by J. E. Wagner, manager and part
owner of Worth track.
"Worth Jockey Club has no inten
tion to conduct a race meeting if the
authorities of Cook County are op
posed to it," he said, and from the at
titude of the other directors it was
evident he made the statement after a
practically unanimous opinion had been
reached.
Shortly after Wagner made the dec
laration which means the end of the
last hope for racing in Chicago this
year, steps were taken by other direc
tors to prevent further shipping of
horses to this city. Word was sent to
horse owners at Nashville and at St.
Louis, who had made preparations to
bring their stables here, to stop all
shipments.
While no definite action has been
taken regarding a probable move to
Hammond or Roby tracks. Just across
the line in Indiana, it is not believed
any such step will be taken.

If Uncle Hank has neglected to ten
der Brick Devereaux a certificate of
thanks, fittingly framed and inscribed,
he is guilty of a breach of baseball
etiquette. ' Brick very kindly handed
Uncle the game at Recreation Park
yesterday without any undue cere
mony and he should be fittingly re
warded. Brick dropped an easy little
throw In the second spasm, which gave
the Seals only three runs, plenty to
carry them through. Score â San Fran
cisco 4, Oakland 1.
The game was a pipe for the native
talent after those three runs arrived.
The Commuters have not yet forsaken
their ancient habit of quitting when
another team starts out in the lead.
Yesterday was no exception for them.
They went out in nearly one-two
time till the last inning, when Dun
ieavy scored a run with a two-cush
ioner to deep center.
Young Henley had everything, or
enough at least to keep the high sign
over the heads of the Commuters. The
Seals played swell baseball in the field,
not one of them falling down. Jimmy
Byrnes pegged six men out at second
base, in fact, he caught every man he
tried to nail on his way to the second
station.
Jimmy's two passed balls in the first
inning cost his team a run. After
Spencer was hit by a pitched ball
Byrnes let two get away from him and
a hit by Hildebrand allowed Spencer to
arrive. The second spasm brought the
grief, however. It was started on Wil
son's hit over second and Gochnauer's
sacrifice.
Henley laid down a simple bunt and
Moskiman fielded the ball to Dever
eaux. The red lad had an hour in
which to get his man, yet he let the
ball slip through his mitts while the
bleachers howled. Henley promptly
stole and Waldron walked. Spencer
chopped one at Francks. Wilson
dashed through while Spencer was be
ing retired at second. Then Walters
responded with a drive to center, let
ting in two more of the Seals.
After that the ginger was abstracted
from the game. The Seals seemed con
tent with their four runs and the Com
muters did not have sand enough left
to wade in and grab some. With two
on the sacks in the last period. Oscar
Graham came in to take a swing at the
ball in Byrnes' stead. He swung vain
ly three times. The score:

"Deaf Mute" FJivls Voice.
Frank Bogleshane, the 15-year-old
boy who has been confined at the De
tention Home for Juveniles on a
charge of peddling and who pretended
to be a deaf mute, has confessed to the
superintendent of the institution that
he can both talk and hear. He will
probably be released.
Atz Saves Day With
Two Drives and
Star Throw.
PORTLAND, April 27.â The fans ac
claim Jaky Atz as the star of to-day's
game. His two timely hits and the
swift hurling of the ball to the home
plate helped clown th* Tigers. Jones
pitched gilt edged ball, but he found
a man named Brown who gave him a
close race for superiority on the slab.
The opening of the third was
spectacular. McLaughlin hit over
Runkle's head. Graham sent a hot one
to third, Brown sacrificed and Doyle
smashed one toward Atz, who froze to
the ball with one mit and nailed Mc-
Laughlin at the plate. Graham and
Doyle tried a double steal. The ball
passed from Murphy through Jones to
Runkle and the side was retired.
In the same inning Murphy walked
and came home on a two-bagger by
Atz. The Tigers tied the score In the
next by Nordyke's run, assisted by
Householder's muff of Eagan's fly.
Murphy walked In the eighth. Atz was
there again and Murphy trotted home
with the winning run. The score:

SEATTLE. April 27. â The Los An
geles team seemed to stand still in the
first inning, while Goodwin was wild
in his work. Seattle as a result scored
three runs off of two passes, four
stolen bases, two hits and two errors
by Eager. After that good ball wts
the order. Until the third the lead of
three runs looked good, when, with
two men down. Flood lined out a
single. Smith followed with a double.
Dillon got a single and Cravath batted
out a three-bagger, netting three runs.
From that time until the ninth they
could not get a hit off Roach. Owing
to a shower the game was called half

POLICE ARREST
MORE SUSPECTS
Four men are now in the "tanks" at
the City Prison on suspicion of having
been implicated in the hold-up at J. C.
Brutt's grocery and saltron. Second and â¢
Brannan streets, last Friday night,
when Thomas Reilly was shot and
killed. They are W. H. Riddel, ar
rested by Special Officer Staub; John
Skurs. George Hunter and William A.
Beebe, arrested by Detectives Ryan and
Matheson.
Beebe was arrested yesterday morn
'ng. He was living at 109 Turk street
with a woman known as oertie Ward.
It was in this same house that Hunter
was living with A ice Mason, and John
Wilson, a companion of Beebe and
Hunter, and now under arrest for a
"short change trick" in Oakland, was
living with Ida Wilson. Hunter was
arrested in Oakland with Wilson, but
was out on bail.
The pol'ce are satisfied that Hunter.
Wilson and Beebe are companions in
crime. John Hartmann, whose saloon
at 516 Second street was held up on
the night of March :J6 by three masked
men, had a look at Hunter and. al
though he was positive that Hunter
was one of the footpads. his con
science would not allow him to make a
formal charge against him. Detectives
Ryan and Matheson are working en
ergeticaJly with the object of getting:
evidence against the suspects for th*
Brutt and Hartmann hold-ups.
The detectives located Beebe's room
and found documents and papers
showing that he had been working in
"fake" land schemes. He was also
canvassing for life insurance policies.
He told the police that he only lived
occasionally at 139 Taylor street. ThÂ»
girl, Alice Mason, was released on her
own recognizance yesterday by Polic*
Judge Cabaniss.
Policeman John J. Tillman also ar
rested two men on Third street early
yesterday morning. One had a big re
volver in his pocket and was charged
with carrying a concealed weapon, and
the other was charged with vagrancy.
They gave their names as George Bar
ber, 20 years of age. and Charles Stev
enson, 24 years of age. One of the men
who held up Hartmann's aaJoon had
dark curly hair. Stevenson has dark
curly hair and answers generally the
description of the footpad. They ar*
also under investigation for this hold
up, but the police say they will have a
charge of burglary anyhow against
them. They also answer the descrip
tion of two men- wanted in San Jost 1
for robbery, with the exception that one
had red curly hair instead of black.

, British Columbia
(m d Panama.
According to the officers of the
eieaauslxlp San Mateo, which arrived
yesterday direct from Panama, there
win soon be two new lines of steamets
plying between this port and the isth
mus. With the Panama railroad
in the hands of Uncle Sam, the trade
hitherto controlled by the Pacific Mail
Company will be open lor all and keen
competition, of which local merchants
vill reap the benefit, will take the
Tla.ce of the present lucrative monop
oly. Incidentally freight rates be
tween here and all Central and South
American ports will be reduced. â¢
As soon as Uncle Sam has his rail
road regulated. the 'square deal"
basis, the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company intends to resume its rela
tions with this part of the world To
begin with it .will put in this trade the
I'eru. which used to be on this run, and
its new Eteamers Mexico and Califor
nia, built specially for the service be
tween this port and Valparaiso. When
the Pacific Steam Navigation Com
pany, at the invitation of local mer
chants, invaded the field monopolized
by ibe Pacific Mail Company, it was
prepared to do almost anything: for
fcajj Francisco shippers. It put on a
fleet of fine steamers and hewed rates
to an almost nominal figure. Instead
<jt supporting the invader, however, the
local shippers used the Pacific j Steam
Navigation Company as a club to beat
down Pacific Mail rates and gave their
business to the Pacific Mail. The
Navigation Company soon , wearied of
a losing game. It withdrew and Pa
cific Mail rates were promptly elevat
ed to their former dizzy height.
â¢ With a chance to ship across the
Isthmus and at Colon make connections
.with another fleet of its steamers, the
British concern is going to try it again
This time its steamers will probably
run the full length of the coast from
Uritith Columbia to Valparaiso.
A French line, now operating on the
east coast, is also planning, say the
Ban Mateos officers, to put steamers
en th:s side, touching at this port and
all Central American ports, as far as
Panama.
The San Mateo, her upper works and
â¢sides newly painted, looked quite smart
when she anchored yesterday morning
In Mission Bay. On her bottom, how
ever, is a deep coating of barnacles and
a heavy crop of long, green vegeta
tion, acquired during a long sojourn in
The warm waters of the Central Ameri
can coast. She left here December 18
under charter to the Pacific Mail Com
pany and since then has been coffee
tramping between Guatemala and Pan-
Ema. She made four trips between San
Jose de Guatemala and Panama, call
ing on the way down at Champerieo,
Acapulco arid Corinto, and in addition
to sugar, rubber and other freight, car
ried, about 116,000 bags of coffee to thÂ«
Isthmus.
Captain Kirkwood of the Mlneola was
In etimmand of the San Mateo when
the" left tie. but about six weeks ago
wasiixiiieTea* by Captain Ross, who
brought the freighter home. The offi
cers found the climate on the coast
very trying and all lost much flesh.
jTfte nirin~+m in I particular- "suffered
Trom the heat and although there was
no serious illness, all hands are glad
to be back where the breezes blow cool
"Carrying coal between Taroma and
Fan Francisco is good enough for us "
they. say.
Owing to the grass and barnacles she
brought with her the San Mateo was
eble to average little more than six
knotE an hour all the way from Pan
ama and the run occupied nineteen
days and twenty-one hours.
After being manicured and painted,
the San Mateo may take a general car
go to Japan.
The Overdue I.i-t
The German ship Altar, th.- length of whose
vora** from this port to' ths old world was
causing some anxiety, arrived yesterday at
Cra\*fefÂ«nd. She was quoted for r*ineurancc at
20 o*r cent. The rat* on the Gostwycs was
advanced yesterday to *."> per cent. The Glen
fcurn'a rate was reduced to a. per cent. The
ether overdues are quoted aa follows: Voor

Tricolor a Biz Carrier.
The Norwegian steamship Tricolor, which
tvrrived on Wednesday from the north, has
been chartered for six months by the Western
Fuel Company to carry coal from Ladysmlth
t<Â» this port. She Is a new vessel. equipped
with" raodern devices for the rapid handling of
freirhi and Is a large carrier. She brought
nearly 6000 tons of coal on her la.Â«t voyage.

GLADDEN HITS
AT OIL TRUST
Sees in the Acceptance of
Rockefeller's Gold Grave
Danger to the Church
BARS ARE LET DOWN
Christians Can No Longerj
Draw the Line Between
Bighteonsness and Wrong
BOSTON, April 27.â Herbert W.
Gleason, secretary of the committee of
Cc-ngrregationalist clergymen which has
been opposing the acceptance by the
American board of money from John
D. Rockefeller, to-day made public a
long statement which Dr. Washington
Gladden, the moderator of the Council
of the Congregational church In this
country, read yesterday before the pro
testing committee. Dr. Gladden an
swered several of the declarations
made by the prudential committee on
behalf of the American board by re
peating arguments previously made by
him in Interviews, particularly with
reference to the contention that the
money should not be accepted because
of Rockefeller's connection with the
Standard Oil Company, which. Dr.
Gladden said, "as a matter of com
mon knowledge has frequently been
convicted, sometimes out of its own
mouth, of transgressions of the laws
of the land."
A Judge of the United States Dis
trict Court was quoted as having de
nounced the Standard Oil Company's
system of rebates as "gross, illegal and
inexcusable," and "the discrimination
complained of in this case." as being
"so wanton and oppressive that it
could hardly have been accepted by
an honest man havin<* due regard for
the rights of others."
Dr. Gladden reviewed at length the
history of the Standard in various
States, where, he said, there had been
violations of the law, and he asserted
"the company has played continually
with stacked cards and loaded dice."
The company's alleged system oi re
batfs was condemned as abhorrent
practices," and Dr. Gladden added:
There is nothing more startling or ominous
In American hlstÂ«>ry than the fact that such
a tremendous Industry has been permitted to
go on year after year with no Interference by
the Government. Of this kind of extortion
Mr. Rockefeller has the credit of being the
Inventor.
We are asked why we single out this man
<Mr. Rockefeller) for reprobation- If the
answer has not already beer, given It Is
enough to say that we did not single him out.
It was the prudential committee who singled
him out by soliciting his donation. We ob
ject to his gift because it is now before us
for Judgment. It is said that there are others
from whom a gilt would be equally ob
jectionable. Even If that were true no gifts
have been offered by these others and it will
bÂ» time to decide about them when they
are offered.
If we accept in our Christian work the alli
ance of the Standard Oil Company we can
refuse no other alliance with oppressors and
despollers of the people. To say that we will
not testify against this iniquity because other*
are nearly or quite as heinous is practically
to say that we will testify against no Iniquity:
that in the presence of all this wrong wÂ»
will shut our eyes ami seal our lips.
If the church wishes to regain Its hold
upon the people who heÂ»Â»r.l its Master gladly
it must keep itself free from such alliances
a* these. Failure here will be the costliest
blunder the church has ever made.
BEATS LITTLE
BOY TO DEATH
Special DtSDatch to The Call.
MANCHESTER. Va., April 27.â Mrs.
Shepard K. Smith Is locked in a cell of
the Manchester jail, charged with hav
ing beaten to death her son Ralph. 5
years old. Her husband, who is be
lieved to t>e in New York, is wanted as
an accessory. The Smiths, with their
two children, came here from New
York.
Mrs. Bertha J. Crostic, a neighbor,
went to the Smith house last night and
saw little Ralph lying dead on the
floor. She asked the mother about tfie
bruises on the boy's body. Mrs. Cros
tic says that Mrs. Smith replied that
she had whipped the child because she
was compelled to do so and added that
she had used a razor strop.
The arrest of Mrs. Smith quickly fol
lowed. Before the Coroner's jury to
day it was testified that she was ac
customed to beating the boy cruelly
and that the lad's father had been seen
to strike him with an ax helve.

Oregon Crop Bulletin.
3"bÂ« Â»oort of BSward A. Besia, Section Di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
Oregon Crop Bulletin, week added April 25, Is
as follow* â¢
The wÂ«attMr during th* week has been fa
â¼ora.bl* for rerminatioa and growth and th*
â¢oil ia In good working condition. A large
amount of rummer fallowing has been done
jsnd the planting- of corn, potatoes, sugar beet*
and gardens has been pushed. Spring wheat
g, except on very low land, U praoticaily
completed. All grains and grasses have made
exoeUent growth during the week, and these
â¢crpps are generally In a very promising con
dition. T*ie sugar beet acreage In the Grand
Eande valley has been considerably Increased.
Cut worm* have made their appearance in the
onion fields of Washington County, but the
damage done by them ha* been slight. Hop*
are very thrifty; the vines in many yards
. reach' to the top of the poles and their train
ing is in active progress. Stock everywhere Is
In fine condition; the flow of milk In the dairy
districts Is abundant: the increase of lambs. li
abovecthe average, and sheep shearing ha*
become general.
Peaches, pears, prunes, plums, cherries and
â¢ Â»pricots kavÂ« been more or less. Injured by th*
late Jrosts; in . some few localities f<>ry Ught
yields are expected, while In other sections
the outlook is much better- The late varieties
cf applts have not blossomed as full a* usual.
Strawberries are doing well. ' "-v-
Dried Fruit- in New York.
Mail reports from New York say:
"The reported damage to the Prune crop In
California wan confirmed from several quarters,
bat no detail* have yet been received and.
pending the arrival of theee, the trade is dis
posed to accept the reports sent by wire with
rf^M-ve. That they have had -some effect upon
th'f epot S*fii*.tioii'T* evident In the - greater
readiness 'of buyers to take hold of apparent â¢
bargains and the reduced pressure to sell j
coods. The' Improvement, however, 1* not of
Â« chÂ«>Â«Â«Â£r to make much of an Impression
upon spot- !>tocitt. as'TJ-.e-aemano" is wholly for
fmall lots. A little business has been done in
future Apricots, reported sale* aggregating
about two cars for early ehlpment, presumably
on the basis of \c t. o\ b. ' coast for choice
Royal? in bags. The buying Is done by the
home trade, exporters not being interested ap
parently ax the present. Spot Apricots- and
Peaches are moving slowly Into consumption,
mainly on orders for lots of live to ten boxeÂ«.
Yr.it neither is being urged, as stocks here are
email end cannot be replenished at lower
rriceg from any source. Moreover, there are
very few left on the coast, and so far as can
be learned there are no offerings from other
market*. There Is a little mere Jobbing de
ir.and for epot fancy seeded Raising, and with
Fupp!ieÂ« of that rrade light the market Is
Â»eteady at <P,Â»c. Currants are quiet, but the
ton,* of the market is steady."
Stocks and Cotton.
The New York wires of E. F. Hutton *
.Co. yesterday Â«ald:
STOCKSâ The close is weak and very ner
vous. Pronounced pressure from liquidation
has "been on the high priced stocks and the
recent favorites, stocks that were bulled on
, rumors of consolidation and dividend Increases
â¢which -no far have not materialized. The pub
lic apparently has lost confidence on the bull
i-ide. The feeling seems to be growing that
production in the various industries has over
taken consumption, in fact that for a time
at least â  â¢ have Been high price* in the stock
market. Then again the uncertainty prevail
ing as to the - attitude toward each other of
'.t. â¢ ,. â¢ financial interests in the East tends to
â¢ ;r.Â«>- a conservative feeling, and added to
this* the political situation abroad offers quite
a littie uncertainty. In view of above facts j
Â«r stir, feel it Is wise to go clow on the bull I
tide at this time. Rallies will necessarily I
oome from oversold speculative markets, but
it f'-rr.a to us such rallies cannot hold. ThÂ«
Mnmc > situation seems to be the disturbing
factor and causing liquidation in foreign mar
ket*. - London is a heavy seller of stocks in
this market to-day.
COTTON â Ba/1 â¢ news from London included
apprehension of a rupture between France
and Germany on account of strained rela
tions over the- situation in Morocco. We are
likely to see some disturbance her" on thi>
account and also in consequence of possibilities
of a further break in both stocks and wheat.
.We see nothing at the moment to warrant
purchases of cotton and would rather advise j
waiting for the sfcie* to clear in Wall street :
and a more reassuring aspect In the' Euro- |
pean political situation.

New York Stock Market,
YEW YORK. April 27.â The lack of ccn
fldVnce In the present level of price* km the
oily obvious cause tor thÂ« wave of liquidation
â ^fci** swept over the utock market to-day and
-â¢rried price* comprehensively to 'Â» lower
Jrrei The liquidation was renewed again and
a*>ain and the entire lack of support and the
failure to attract any effective demand at the
cheaper price* caused progressive growth in the
'telimr erf distrust. The violence of the de
cline cave rise *to a crop of Â«lnister rumors
â¢Â«r "nometning harrlng over the market.' 1 No
"better Joundstioa developed for these rumor*
while the trading was in progress than for th*
nany brilliant stories which have regaled the
emulative aupetlte while prices were being
du3)Â«J opwart. The stocks centering about
the Northern Securities '>Â«npany snared fully
in the day's weakness, but they were not Â«o
* K'rirlV conspicuous as had been the case lately.
Humors regarding these properties having
< cached from the stage of wholesale consolida
tion' to that of complete antagonism, followed
by denials of. the supposed hostilities, the stock
rrarket Impression haÂ« settled down to the view
that capita! irt*r In control cf these properties
probably have "fceen attending to the affairs of
their own properties without . contemplating
anything to & ye basla to the roseate storieg
about them which have obtained wldeepread
belief Tire 'resulting state: of mind on this
topi^'ls fairly representative" of that on- the
wia^'y otfter stoats which have been made the
obje-t of 'imaginative reports. of late. Yester
day* retention of the former dividend on Nor
folk ted Western eeerced to shatter the hopes
Â°of sp'-culater* regarding a ' large number of
other Â«wclcÂ«j which have been heavily bought
on'Â»lJr!!er expectations: The story of the
Louisville leÂ«*p to the -Atlantic Coast Line on a
7 per cT.t dividend bavif which was the latest
production of this'^wracter obtained so little
credit ii>-C&y that those two stocks were
among tie prirrinal * sufferers by reason of
the violent reaction 'from yesterday's Jump.
BBmon -tt 'inrrgers among, the metal indus
trials wM<li have lifted prices extensively were
maKtlXy c;*ij U> suspicion with - consequent
damage to the stocks concerned. Another break
In the wheat market served to renew anxiety
regarding losses in that speculation which
would have to be made good In the stock
market. The opening Influence on the selling
from foreign financial centers was strong owing
to the unsettlement there over the international
political outlook. Parts manifested decided
uneasiness over the dispute with Germany ; re
garding conditions in Morocco. The report that
the cable to the Asian mainland from the
island nearest to the field of naval activity
had been cut seemed to Inspire the circulation
of sensational rumors that the expected naval
battle had been already fought with unexpected
results. But it is doubtful whether any or all
of these matters had as much influence upon
the veiling as a vague feeling of euepicion and
a fear of some unfavorable developments yet
to be announced. Th* discussion of the Mil
waukee bank episode and the Equitable Life
scandal, with the United States Shipbuilding
incident were believed to threaten a spread of
distrust over a wide field and the resulting
loss of confidence waa dreaded for it* results
on credits. The sharpness of the rally yester
day had aroused hopes that the most urgent
liquidation was over, although It was expected
that profit taking by those who supported the
market on the break and who secured holdings
at the low price would check th* rally. . The
character of to-day*e selling was a plain inti
mation that important liquidation remained to
be completed. The volume of the selling gave
rise to some startling estimates of the propor
tions of the speculative losses which have been
suffered by reason of ill-judged., campaigns.
Financial authorities of a substantial char
acter expressed the opinion that the awaken
ing to the illusory character of much of the
recent gossip would make for the health of
the market, although the readjustment might
prove a painful success. The tone at the close
was semi-demoralized and showed, losses of
from 2 to over 6 points for all the . principal
active stocks in the list. .
Bonds were weak. Total sales, par value,
$2,995,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call. .. â

CHICAGO, April * 27.â The prto* â¢*: ot Z wheat
1 lor May delivery foil 4-% cents per bushel
to-day on renewed selling. by discouraged hold
ers. The lowest point of .the day was touched
at 86f40. The weakness 'was due largely to a
! sharp , decline at Liverpool and to continued
excellent weather in America. The market; be
came quite firm late in â  the session on covering
Iby shorts. At the close i May - wheat was I oft
B%c. At the opening the wheat market was
decidedly, weak. May was off l%c to 3%c at
SB%Â®9oc, while July was down %o to %c at
82% @83c.' Under enormous sales from scatter
ed longs the price of May was forced down to
S6%c before the end -of the first hour. \ Mil
lions 'of bushels of wheat are said to have
changed hands during the break. July slumped
off in sympathy to S2>.i@B2%a. A number of
influences entered into the situation and tended
to create the prevailing bearish sentiment.. One
of the leading elements . waa a sharp break In
wheat prices at â  Liverpool. Another promi
nent factor was weakness at Minneapolis.- Per
haps the most vital cause, however, was the
excellent weather prevailing throughout "- the
United States. Additional rain had fallen over
the winter " wheat belt. With prediction of
higher temperatures prospects (were favorable
for* the ; fall I sown crop. : Toward | midday I buy
ing of May by a leading bull gaye â¢ some sup
port to the market, but the effect of the buy
ing was | partially offset by rumors '.that the
same operator was selling under cover. Later
a firmer tone developed on quite general cover-
Ing by shorts. The close was moderately firm
with final quotations on ' May at 88c and July
at 83c. "
Lower cables and the break In wheat caused
heavy selling of corn early , in the session, re
sulting in â  considerable â  weakness/but with a
good ' demand - from shorts the ' market became
j quite strong. July closed %@%c higher. , \ â 
Oats closed practically â at the highest -point
jof the day. July opened at 28%@ 1 28% c, sold up
I to 28T4)C and closed at the top.
1 The feature of ' trading In provisions was re
newed liquidation of May: holdings and the

TALK TO JUDGE.
Tell l-iim of the Trouble Between Mrs. Kate
Doran and Mrs. Julia Sullivan.
One Infant, Submitted to His Honor's Gaze,
Is Declared Victim of Calumny.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
While advancing to the gate of her
front yard to admit the ashman, Mrs.
Kate Dolan overheard Mrs. Julia Sul
livan remark to a lady neighbor, "Here
come* crazy Kate." Mrs. Dolan
thereupon oaused a warrant to issue
for the arrest of Mrs. Sullivan on the
charge of disturbing the peace, and to
Police Magistrate Cabaniss was as
eigned the delicate task of adjudicating
the ease.
Mrs. Dolan, Blender of form and care-
worn of face, explained to the court
that she and Mrs. Sullivan are Joint
oocupants of the dwelling at 820 Ala
bama street. "AffÂ»r calling me Crazy
Kate," testified Mrs. Dolan, "che said
that if I didn't drink so much I
wouldn't have fits. I don't drink and I
don't hayÂ« fits."
Mrs. Nora Kavanagh of 839 Alabama
street swung a revolutionary babe in
her arms as she told the Judge that
in her opinion Mrs. Sullivan was an
undesirable neighbor, while Mr?. Dolan
was noted fox the assiduity with which
she attended to her own business.
Mrr. F. FerrisÂ«, daughter of the de
fendant, opined that her mother's Ire
had be^n .aroused by Mrs. Dolan say
ing. "Will ye look at the homely puss
of that kid." the object of the allusion
bring an infantile member of the Fer
lis family, which the witness held up
for the bench's inspection and opinion
as to whether Mrs. Dolan's alleged
criticism of its face was just. "It's not
a bad-looking child at all," said his
Honor, scanning the little one '*h a
connoisseur:- â¢ yo.
Mrs. C. Gallagher transferred her
baby fro. . her left to her right arm
as she ascended the witness stand,
where she swore that she never saw
Mr 6. Sullivan do anything decidedly
wrong nor perceived Mrs. Dolan do
anything exactly right.
Mrs. Sullivan herself, a corpulent
matron, then asseverated that she
never said anything good, bad or in
different to Mrs. Dolan. "I never called
her Crazy Kate," Mrs. Sullivan added,
"although every one in the neighbor
hood knows her by that name. Nor
did I say anything about her drinking
bringing on fits, though I do think that
if she'd stop rushing the growler and
the bottle she'd get . along better with
her neighbors." The lady was appar
ently going to augment hc?r testimony
with something startling when her son
dashed into the railed inclosure.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 1905
grasped one of her arms and, gently
pulling her toward him, exclaimed,
"Come out â that's enough!" The Judge
resented such unwarranted Interference
with a witness by ordering Bailiff Car
mlchael to eject young Mr. Sullivan
frem the tribunal.
â  We don't want any unsworn court
officers here," shouted his Honor as
the youth was led away. Then to the
contestants he said, '"This case is dis
missed. I hope, Mrs. Sullivan, that you
will have nothing more to say to or
about Mrs. Dolan. And as for you, Mrs.
Dolan, It is the advice of this court
that you cease rushing the growlerâ
also thp bottle."

Mrs. Carrie Damon informed Judge
Fritz that of all the landladies she had
ever dwelt with or even heard yf, Mrs.
Margaret Atkins of 1113^ Howard
street was unquestionably the most dis
agreeable. It was Mrs. Atkins' wont,
Mrs. Damon averred, to imbibe intoxi
cants to excess, and then, with mind
deranged, to eavesdrop at the closed
door of Mrs. Damon's apartment by
alternating eye and ear at the key
hole. When caught in the act and
mildly remonstrated with, Mrs. Atkins
bridled up and said offensive and un
warranted things anent Mrs. Damon's
character, insinuating that as she was
a widow and passing comely she
"would bear watching." On one oc
casion Mrs. Atkins even went sp far
as to accuse Mrs. Damon of entertain
ing different men in her room, while
the truth was that the only male per
son who had the entree to the apart
ment was the gentleman whom its oc
cupant was engaged to wed. Con
sciousness of her innocence of evil
doing might have enabled Mrs. Damon
to withstand these annoyances indefi
nitely, but when she returned home
one evening and found her little
dai'ghter's ?25 doll sadly mutilated
and the child in tears, her patience fled
and she had Mrs. Atkins, who perpe
trated the outrage, arrested for dis
turbing the peace.
"The charge ought to be that of ma
licious mischief," said the Judge, "and
I would advise you to amend the com
plaint accordingly."
Before the suggestion could be com
plied with Mrs. Atkins proposed a cash
settlement, and after some hesitation
Mrs. Damon accepted it.

After waiting from December 13,
1904, until last week to see whether
the Grand Jury would indict Marie
Doris, a Bacon-place denizen, for giv
ing him a $3 bribe to let her pursue
her illegal calling in peace, Patrolman
J. P. P. Deane swore to a complaint
himself and had the woman haled be
fore Judge Conlan. He testified that
she gave him the money and that hÂ°
transfermd it to the keeping of Police
Commissioner % Hutton, who v/ns theft
engaged in an anti-brothel rruvde on
his own account, but no further action
was taken. The defense questioned the
legality of Deane's appointment as a
policeman, as he had not constantly
resided in this city for five years pre
ceeSng the date of n)ch appointment
but warn mustered out of the regular
army in 196 2 ;it the Presidio. Mr.
Hutton denied that he instructed
Deane to accent ;i bribe from the
woman in order to prove that police
bribery by cotfrtesan* was of common
occurrence. Then the hearing was
continued till to-day.

ARE MISTAKEN
FOR BURGLARS
Dr. W. B. Palamountaln of the
Southern Pacific HosDital and Dr. J.
B. Balsiger of the California Woman's
Hospital had to prove to the Harbor
police on Wednesday evening that they
were not burglars. The medicos made
good but it took them two hours to
do it. They missed a social engage
ment in Oakland and incidentally
learned how it feels to be "it" when
the famous "third degree" is being ad
ministered by professional "sleuths."
The money box in the public tele
phone booth located in the downstairs
waiting room of tlje ferry depot has
been burglarized ten times within the
last few weeks. Attached to the coin
receptacle is a burglar alarm which
should ring an electric bell outside the
depot, near the news stand. So far
the burglars have managed to beat the
alarm. Some time Wednesday morn
ing a thief cut the leather- bellows on
which the transmitter rests, reached
through the incision and cleaned out
the money box. The burglary was dis
covered too late to allow of repairs
being made, but to prevent any pros
pecting J after subsequent switch fees
the alarm attachment was adjusted in
side the incision in the bellows.
Drs. Palamountain and Balsiger were
waiting for the 8:35 o'clock narrow
gauge boat when one of them remem
bered an undelivered message.
"Let's telephone," they said. And
they did.
"This is funny," paid Palamountain,
poking his finger into the thief-made
hole in the bellows. "Guess somebody
has been trying to tap the till."
Policeman O'Callaghan was pacing
the flags near the news stand when
the doctors entered the telephone
booth. When Palamountain poked his
finger in the bellows the burglar alarm
near O'Callaghan's head began a furi
ous buzzing.
Almost before the medicine* man had
removed his finger OCallaghan had a
grip on his. coat collar and an iron
grasp on Balsiger's wrist.
"What are you fellows doing in
here?" demanded the policeman.
The doctors at first were indignant,
but O'Callaghan looked like business
and they tried to explain. They told
him who they were and proved it by
cards and correspondence in their
pockets. They didn't look like bur
glars and O'Callaghan was almost per
suaded that they were all right when
Policeman Jim McGowan appeared on
the scene. O'CaJlaghan explained
briefly to his brother officer.
Now McGowan has been reading
Raffles. The fine raiment and polished
manners which to O'Callaghan had in
dicated decency were to McGowan con
firmation of the men's guilt.
"These are the fellows we've been
looking for. These are the men who've
been robbing all these boxes. Let's
book 'em."
And Drs. Palamountain and Balsiger
were marched to the Harbor police
station.
"Caught 'em red handed," volun
teered McGowan, as he ushered his
prisoners into the presence of the
booking sergeant.
But they were not booked. A tele
phone company detective who had been
summoned was able to account for the
condition of the bellows and after a
couple of hours' detention, during
which the physicians told and retold
the stories of their lives and the his
tory of their movements that day up
to the time of their visit to the tele
phone booth, the medicos were re
stored to liberty.
