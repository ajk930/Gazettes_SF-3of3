Stean ship Andromeda sailed for Port

quantity of medical supplies, appli

The Andromeda had on board two
surgeons, nearly the entire staff of the
Government hospital and eighty tons

ST. PETERSBURG, Jan 4, 2:40 a. m.
The flood of telegrams from abroad
bringing talk of peace stirs only resent
ment in official circles here, and even
many liberals, who are urgently press
ing the Government for reforms,
aroused by the dreadful story of hero
ism and suffering of the Port Arthur
garrison, declare emphatically against
any cessation of hostilities until Rus
sia's honor Is vindicated by a victory in
Manchuria,
Equal resentment Is aroused by for
eign criticism of General Stoessel -for
flowing up the ships in the harbor and
destroying the town of Port Arthur
when he could no longer defend them.
Admiration here for the heroic de
fense is mingled with wonder how Gen
f:al Stoessel continued to hide the true
jnditions from the world.
Emperor Nicholas has already grant
ed General Stoessel's request that his
officers be allowed to give their parole.
In Russia for the moment the people
seem to have forgotten all their differ
ences in the common grief. The revolu
tionists, who had intended to mark the
event with demonstrations, evidently
found the moment inopportune, and
no disturbance was reported anywhere
In Russia.

CINCINNATI, Jan. 3.âUnless the
'preliminary negotiations fall through,
another international marriage is im
minent in the family of Thomas P.
Kgan, the millionaire manufacturer of
Cincinnati. This time it is his son,

her native land, a foreign girl of title,
one even of royal blood.
Last spring when young Egan was
in Honolulu it happened that a pretty
Portuguese girl was. stopping at the
Karme hotel. They fell in love, but Egan
did not know until after he had pro
posed that she was a Portuguese Prin

for the marriage are now under way.

EXTENSIVE
LAND FRAUDS
IN IDAHO
Prominent Persons
Involved in a
Syndicate,
Case Laid Before Federal
Officers and Action Will
Be Taken.
Puter Resents Statements of Mitchell of
Oregon and Gives Damaging Evi
dence Against the Senator.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.âExtensive
land frauds are now under investiga
tion in Idaho, and the statements made
by the officers here and the men from
that State disclose frauds more far
reaching even than those In Oregon.
The investigation was started last
week by order of President Roosevelt,
who received affidavits from Idaho,
through Senator Dubois. These affi
davits are four In number and were
sent to Senator Dubois by Fred D.
Culver of Lewiston, Idaho, who was a
candidate for Attorney General of that
State on the Democratic ticket two
years ago.
Rumors have been in circulation to
day involving Important persons in
Washington, but Senator Dubois made
a positive statement to-night that no
Important Washington names are in
cluded in the affidavits, and that the
only persons- mentioned, so far as he
knew, are in Idaho.
The affidavits now in the President's
hands charge that a syndicate is in
existence in Idaho, created for the pur
pose of acquiring by illegal means tim
ber lands from the Government by
false entries, the same as in Oregon.
The persons named In the affidavits
are W. F. Kehenbach, president of a
trust company; George H. Kester,
cashier of a bank, and Clarence Rob
nett, all of. Lewiston, Idaho.
It is said In the affidavits that more
than $1,000,000 worth of land has been
taken from the Government by means
of false entries.
Inasmuch as the accused men are
personal friends of Senator Dubois,
the latter finds the situation embar
rassing.
Secretary Hitchcock, to whom the
affidavits were referred by the Presi
dent, instituted the investigation. In
formation sent to the Interior Depart
ment charges that frauds have been
perpetrated at the Land Office at Boise,
as well as Lewiston, and it is Intimat
ed that the Inquiry when fairly start
ted will reach out In many directions
and many prominent citizens of Idaho
may become entangled.
Within the past three weeks over
1500 patents on timber and homestead
lands in the Roseburg (Or.) Land Of
fice, covering about 380,000 acres of
land, have been held up at the Interior
Department, pending investigation.
Roseburg Is the home of Representa
tive Hermann, who was recently in
dicted by the Grand Jury in connection
with? alleged land frauds.
HENEY TO CONTINUE WORK.
Fresh indictments are being prepared
In Portland, Or., where the Grand Jury
will resume its sessions during this
week, and persons prominent In public
life, other than those whose names al
ready have been Implicated, are In
volved. The mission of Oliver E. Pagin.
the assistant attorney in the Depart
ment of Justice, who left here some
days ago for Portland, Is to assist in
the framing of new indictments, a
work in which he figured conspicuously
during the postal Investigation a couple
of years ago.
Pagin is expected to return here in
time to take part in the presentation
of the Government's position before the
Supreme Court of the United States in
the Hyde-Benson case, which the Gov
ernment appealed to that body after
the discharge of the leading defendants
on habeas corpus proceedings brought
in New York. This case probably will
be heard next month.
No successor to United States Dis
trict Attorney Hall, who was recently
removed, has yet been selected, and It
Is expected that Francis J. Heney will
remain in charge of the Government's
Interests In the pending proceedings at
Portland.
PORTLAND, Jan. 3.âThe chief of
the minor conspirators convicted of
carrying on fraud against the Govern
ment, S. A. D. Puter, issued a state
ment to-day in which he reiterates
the charge that Senator Mitchell re
ceived $2000 from him to rush through
certain claims. His statement is-given
in answer to the charge made by the
Senator that he had been indicted on
the word of self-confessed rascals and
perjurers. Puter also paid his respects
to Senator Fulton, who came out in
an interview recently calling Puter a
perjurer. Puter said:
"When I said that I gave Mitchell
52000 to use his influence with Binger
Hermann to expedite those land claims
I told the truth, and Senator Mitchell
knows it. According to Mitchell's
statements, I am a man who would
deliberately perjure a man's liberty
away. I will say that a man who
would willingly go on a witness stand
and perjure himself to rob another man
of his liberty is deserving of and ought
to receive the severest kind of punish
ment.
"I gave Senator Mitchell $2000 to get
those patents through, and I will say
that I never regretted telling anything
so much in my life as the fact that
Mitchell took that money. I never
told a living soul in my life before
I gave the details to Mr. Heney. I
never told it to McKinley or Tarpley,
my partners in these deals.

Minister Conger and Wile
Claim to Have Won Her
to Christianity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SIOUX CITY, lowa. Jan. 3âThat the
Dowager Empress of China has been
converted to Christianity through the
influence of United States Minister E.
H. Cor.ger and his wife, who have lived
almost eight years in Peking; that she
has given substantial promises that her
conversion should be announced in the
most public way before Minister Con
ger shall leave Peking, and that she
will, following this announcement, take
steps toward the inauguration of a
great era of reforms in the empire, are
the claims put forth for Minister Con
ger by relatives and friends who have
recently received letters from Peking.
Christian Science friends of the Con
gers in lowa claim it all as a great
victory for Christian Science.
It will be recalled that whin th*
diplomats were besieged In Peking,
during the Boxer uprising four years
ago. Christian Science throughout the
world organized a conspiracy of prayer
for the colony of diplomats, the Con
gers being converts to that cult. When
the legationers were at last rescued
the claim was boldly advanced that it
was in answer to the prayers of the
Scientists, or, rather, the result of the
overpowering rush of thought waves
in their direction, which had hurled off
the unthinking barbarians.
Since then the Congers have become
very friendly with the Dowager and
Mrs. Conger has often been given pri
vate audiences with the old woman.
As a result, it is said, the Dowager
Empress has been converted to Chris
tianity and has promised great things.
Minister Conger believes that as a
result of the casting of her tremendous
power and ability into the scale on the
side of progressiveness, China will open
it? gates to Christian people, ideas and
institutions; that the empire will rap
idly be christianized and, in short, that
there is just dawning" a day of rehabili
tation for China, which will compare
only to the regeneration of Japan since
1854, when the ancient empire was
transformed Into a thoroughly modern
power.
China is to go through the same pro
cess, under the lead of a Christian
dynasty, if the Congers have not been
misled.
as to the fraudulent character of the
entries to this land. When Hermann
gave me to understand that the land
was down and out and that the matter
would have to be referred back to
the Oregon City Land Office I went to
Senator Mitchell and told him that
these patents would have to go through
for the reason that If they were re
ferred back to the original office the
whole thing would be lost. I told him
that the entrymen were scattered and
that it would be impossible to get them
together again.
"I laid two $1000 bills on the table.
Mitchell said that It was too much. I
was desperate over a desire to get the
patents through, and told him to take
the money, go over and see Hermann
and have him take the claims up for
consideration, and under no circum
stances to allow them to go back to
the local office.
"All I know about Hermann is that
after the money was paid to Mitchell
and I had given him that Inducement
to make a good hard talk, Hermann
changed his mind. Why he did it I
don't know and wouldn't presume to
say."
"Did you know Mitchell before you
went to Washington?" was asked.
"Yes, I had known him for a long
time."
"And Hermann?"
"Yes."
"What about this letter of introduc
tion from Mays? Why was it writ
ten?"
LETTER TROM MAYS.
"I'll tell you about that letter. Be
fore I left. for Washington I went to
Mays and told him I was going back
to see the Senator about those lands
that I had had so much trouble about
and that a few lines from him would
help the case. He sat down and wrote
a few lines, put it in an envelope and
sealed it up. I delivered it to Senator
Mitchell without seeing it. I don't
know that it was a letter of introduc
tion. I didn't ask for a letter of intro
duction and, an he knew that I was
acquainted with Mitchell, I can see
no reason why he should write a letter
of introduction. He probably wrote
something else.
"Senator Fulton assumes that I am
a self-confessed perjurer and gives out
interviews about me," continued Puter,
"and he has no business to do that kind
of thing. Charlie Fulton had better
look to himself and be careful. He was
attorney for me once In connection
with some land matters and Judge
McÃride threw the case out of court
for the reason that it had no standing.
Fulton accepted my money as attorney
in the case, although it couldn't stand
in court."

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 3. âNo man of the many
who want it can yet claim the toga
that Is here to be won. The situation
is an unusual one, for none of the
powers that are supposed to make
Senators has definitely announced Its
desire, though the railroad is well, or,
in other words, largely represented in
the camp of Frank P. Flint. There is
much speculation as to what will be
the outcome of the fteht, and all of
this speculation only leads to the con%
elusion that no man has a walkover,
and each of the candidates In the field,
Bard, Flint, Knight, Oxnard and Fisk,
has a right to the claim the friends
of each are making that none of the
five can be counted out of the fight.
It is rumored around the lobbies to*
night that Fisk has captured five or
six of Flint's votes and that there is
much scurrying in the Los Angeles
camp in consequence. It is the opinion
that Fisk is likely to succeed to the
Perkins vote âto the support of those
men that have followed the political
fortunes of the senior Senator from
California âbut with what result can
only be conjectured.
The story goes to-night that Ruef's
name will not be presented as a
candidate for the Senate. If this
opinion proves to be well founded it
will release several votes, and these,
it is believed, will go to Fisk, whose
announcement that he is in a recep
tive mood is evidently being seriously
HERRIN'S AGENTS.
George A. Knight's friends are vexed
at the attitude of Herrin's avowed
agents. When the fight opened it was
understood that Herrin was going to
keep his hands off and that he had an
nounced to several candidates that they
could enter the fight without fear of
hammering from the railroad forces
when the day for the vote drew close.
Knight still adheres to the belief that
Herrin has not broken faith, but in
common with his friends he is unable
to explain the presence here and the
activity on behalf of Flint of Jere
Burke, Walter Parker, "Johnny" Lynch
and "Johnny" McKenzle, known and
noted agents of Herrin.
MEN OF PROMINENCE SEEN

Knight Anxious About
the Position of
Railroad.
Even though he adheres to the opin
ion that Herrin has not broken faith,
Knight frankly admits that the South
ern Pacific holds In its possession a
gold brick of exceeding beauty that it
is going to hand either to him or to
Flint, to which he will not even hazard
a guess.
"But," says Knight in conclusion, "if
I get the gold brick I guess I can stand
it better than Flint." Just how he
could stand the yellow package better
than Flint he does not explain.
The views of the candidates that Her
rin has the gold brick ready for pre
sentation is shared by the onlookers
here, though it is generally agreed that
the activity of Herrin's agents on be
half of Flint must inevitably lead to an
acquisition of strength by Bard.
RAILROAD INTERFERENCE.
There are many here who want the
toga to go to the southern portion of
the State, and will fight to see that it
goes there, that do not favor railroad
interference, so it is conjectural as to
whether the manipulations of Burke,
McKenzie, Parker and Lynch, notwith
standing the force they represent, are
going to carry the day. â¢
Allegations that Speaker Prescott is
using his power to name committee
chairmen to further the interest of
Flint with the full knowledge of Gov
ernor Pardee are .being made by the
friends of the other Senatorial candi
dates, and these appointments are be
ing watched with great interest by
them. The most important committee

Give Democrats
Share of the
Patronage.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 3.âLegislation
of much moment to the Democrats
was enacted at the session of the As
sembly held this morning. A resolu
tion fathered by Cromwell giving to
each of the four lonesome Bourbon
Assemblymen the same amount of
patronage, $10 a day, enjoyed by the
Republican members was adopted. A
point of order was raised that this was
not a subject for the House in regular
session to deal in, but a matter to be
handled in Republican caucus. The
point was waived, however, and the
resolution carried unanimously.
None of the Bourbon four rose to
win for himself a crown of virtue and
a halo, together with the acclaim of
the people, by declaring he would have
none of the State's money to scatter
to the winds and the New Year will
bring happiness to a few at least of
the faithful ones who followed the
Democratic banner.
The Assembly ordered the Gov
ernor's message printed, adopted a
few routine resolutions and adjourned
until 11 o'clock to-morrow morning.
Speaker Prescott, it is said by those
close to him, has his hardest nut to
crack in the way of committee chair
manships in that of the Judiciary
Committee. The heads of the other
committees have practically all been
decided on, but there are a half-dozen
applicants for the Judiciary chairman
ship, each one a personal friend of
General Prescott, and each with some
claim for preferment.
WALSH IN" THE LEAD.
"The contest has narrowed down to
three men," said one of the Assembly
men, "Houser, Duryea and Walsh, with
the last named looking as the winner.
Houser can hardly get the place, as
Stanton has been made chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee and
it would hardly do to give both the
two most important chairmanships in
the House to the south. Duryea is an
old member and stands well with the
Speaker, but Walsh, also a member of
the last House, is the man at present.
General Prescott is lying awake
nights over this contest."
Assemblyman Moore is going to in
troduce a bill that will create comment
and strike a blow at an industry that
he thinks is assuming undesirable
prominenceâthat of slaughtering hu

Pardee's message has been read, tech

his views of the duties of the present
Legislature are being discussed by the
members of both houses. The Senate
convened this morning at 11 o'clock
and after prayer had been offered by
the chaplain, the sergeant at arms an
nounced that the Governor's message
had arrived. It was ordered read by
the President, whereupon Leavitt
msved that as a copy of the document
had been handed to each member of
the Senate and of the press this
formality be dispensed with. Presi
dent Anderson said that he wished it
to appear of record that the document
had been read and ordered that at least
the introductory paragraphs be recit
ed by the secretary. This took but a
moment and the Governor's messaK*
was declared read into the record. The
Governor's messajre in full is to be
found in a special supplement issued
by The Call.
Following the technical reading of
the message a further communication
from the chief executive calling for
confirmation by the Senate of appoint
ments he has made since the last ses
sion of the Legislature was read:
Muenter offered a resolution provid
ing for the appointment of a com
mittee of three on contingent expenses
and mileage. Muenter, Leavitt and
Emmons were appointed. Woodward
presented a resolution providing that
each bill introduced amending an ex
isting bill shall have the new portion
underscored and the portion of the old
law to be amended inclosed in brack
ets, providing, however, that the
amendment shall not be in the nature
of an added section, in which case it
shall not be underscored. Woodward,
Belshaw and Sanford were appointed
a special committee to consider the
resolution more fully and to report
back to the Senate to-morrow.
The Senate then adjourned until 11
o'clock to-morrow.

General Stoessel had been a Japanese

EFFORTS TOWARD PEACE.
Some of the foreign diplomats here
believe that there will be ati early re

Outwardly the Japanese Government

that direction, but it is known that it
is prepared to discuss the question and
to make terms which are character
ized as reasonable.
Those who predict a movement for
peace declare that the Japanese Em

Japanese to give honorable terms to

tion of peace.
The United States, Great Britain and
France are named as possible direct or
indirect intermediaries, though it Is not
improbable that Japan will broach the
subject directly.
The fall of Port Arthur immensely
strengthens the hand of Japan. In the
actual conduct of the war Port Ar
thur has been a stumbling block to
Japan,--which for six months-has-trad
engaged more than 100,000 troops and
practically her entire navy. This fact
compelled Field Marshal Ovama to
fight the battle of Liaoyang shorthand
ed.
Now the entire navy is free to pre
pare to meet the Russian second Pa
cific squadron and to attend to the
Vladivostok squadron. A heavy force
of troops will be immediately available
for service in Manchuria, and this pos
sibly wiif allow the undertaking of oth
er independent enterprises.
It is expected that the Diet will now
take a recess and hold a special session
for the purpose of passing a vote of
thanks to General Nogi and the men
of the Third Army.
A great lantern procession in celebra
tion of the surrender of Port Arthur
was held to-night and the city was
splendidly illuminated. Thousands of
men carrying flags and lanterns
marched through the streets and visit
ed and cheered the various depart
ments of the Government.
STOESSEL'S DISPATCHES.
I Messages That Informed the Czar of
the Garrison's Plight.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 3.âGeneral
: Stoessel's dispatches by way of Chefu
to the general staff relate how the po
sition of the fortress of Port Arthur
gradually became less safe and more
' critical, the ravages of scurvy in-
I creasing enormously the casualty list,
j already so considerable from the Jap
| anese assaults and bombardments.
â  Toward the end of the year the sup
ply ot ammunition completely gave
out; there were 14,000 sick and wound
ed in the hospitals, and 300 fresh
casualties daily. The general reports
that at the end of the siege he had
only 10.000 men under arms, the re
mainder of the original garrison hav
ing either been killed or disabled. On
December 28 the general wrote:
The |x>sltlon of the fortress is becoming very
painful. Our chief enemies are scurvy, which
is mowing down the men, and i 1-Inch shells,
which know no obstacle and against which
there Is no protection. There remain only a
few who have not been attacked by scurvy.
\W have taken all the possible measures, but
the disease 1b spreading. The passiw endur
ance of the enemy* bombardment, the 11-inch
shells, the Impossibility* of replying for want
of ammunition, the outbreak of scurvy and
the loss of a mass of officersâall these causes
diminish dafly the capabilities of the defense,
and the tale of losses of higher officers Is an
indication of the enormous losses we nave sus-'
.talned. Of ten generals, twoâKondratenko

killed and two are wounded. s
On December 29 General Stoessel
wrote:
At 10 o'clock yestciday morning the Jap
anese blew up part of the parapet of Fort No.
3. They afterward opened a severe bombard
ment along the whole front, but especially on
Fort No. 3. At about 3 o'clock in the after
noon they dashed to the attack or the parapet
from the moat and glacis, where they had been
held In readiness. Two attacks were re
pulsed, but the Japanese occupied the funnel
shaped opening formed by the explosion, and,
reipforced by their reserves, began to run
across the moat in groups of about five. They
occupied the parapet and at dusk two bat
talions had entered the Interior of the fort.
Our troops fought from the entrenchments,
which were badly damaged. Fart of our
troops hid themselves in the casements, but
the Japanese placed machine guns In front of
the exit of the casements, thus depriving our
men hidden there of all possibility of making
an attack. Three counter attacks from the
outside by our reserves met with- no success.
The fort consequently remained flsathe posses
sion of the Japanese. Our losses were consid
erable, especially In officers. The survivor* of
the garrison succeeded in getting out of the
fort by the windows. By the occupation' of
this fort the Japanese became masters of the
whole north front and the fortress can hoi*
out only a few days more. We have almrst
no ammunition. I will take measures to pre
vent carnage In the streets.
Scurvy is sensibly weakening the garrison.
I have now under arms only 10,000 men, all
sick.
Generals Fock and Nlkltina have been ver
itable heroes and admirable collaborators.
Among the artillery Colonel Ramon was
wounded. Colonel Peterhoff was killed and six
officers were wounded, Among the other high
officers there was an enormous percentage of
killed or several times wounded. Many com
panies are commanded -by ensigns And the
companies only average sixty men strong.
The Japtme-se since December IB have re
frained from assaulting. Yesterday they ex
ploded a mine under the fortifications of Fort
No. B and about a sedre bf hardy Japanese
mounted the ramparts, but were exterminated
by bayonets and hand grenades. In revenge
the Japanese bombarded all night long and all
day long with 11-inch shells, especially the
hospitals and ambulances, although knowing
full well that there was no possibility of our
wounded heroes Joining the ranks of the de
fenders. ,
There are 14.000 sick and wounded in the
hospitals and the number increases by about 700
daily.
General Stoessfl's reports of Decem
ber 28 and 29, painting the harrowing
picture of the depleted and exhausted
garrison fighting on hopelessly, were
posted on the bulletin boards this aft
ernoon and attracted enormous crowds,
whose grief at the fall of the fortress
was overcome by admiration for the
heroic defenders. The War Office and
Admiralty were goon besieged by grief
stricken relatives and friends of those
at Port Arthur, eagerly asking for
news.
The city is perfectly quiet, the agi
tators finding that the people were in
no mood for demonstrations against
the Government.
AMERICA HOLDS ALOOF.
No Foundation for Reports of Pros
pective Mediation.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.âWhatever
effect the fall of Port Arthur may
have on the ultimate issue of the war
the attitude of this Government to
ward the Belligerents has not under
gone the slightest change. More than
once the American Government has
let St Petersburg and Tokio know
that it stands ready at any time to
render neighborly assistance whenever
both belligerents are prepared to wel
come it. Further than this the Gov
ernment has not gone.
Reports that President Roosevelt is
likely to institute negotiations for
friendly mediation between Russia
and Japan are premature at least, and
entirely unauthorised.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE JAPA
NESE THIRD ARMY, IN FRONT OF
PORT ARTHUR, Dec. 29.âAfter many
weeks of patient toil by a regiment of
the center division the making of nine
tunnels under the north wall of Rih
lung Mountain fort through solid rock
was completed and the mines laid on
December 28.
Without warning seven mines con
taining two tons of dynamite were ex
ploded at 10 o'clock on the morning of
the 28th. The spectacle was magnifi
cent. The entire front walls of the fort
seemed to be lifted into the air in a
tremendous opaque curtain of earth
and debris of all kinds.
There was no preliminary bombard-
ment to give the Russians a hint of
what was in store for them. Half the
garrison perished as the result of the
explosions and the subsequent charge
of the Japanese.
The force of the explosions was tre
mendous. The entire hillside was cov
ered with earth and debris ,and the
moat was filled to a level with the
broken walls of the fort.
In anticipation of a stubborn resist
ance by a large garrison the Japanese
before daylight pushed a large force
into the trenches, where they remained
concealed until the explosions took
place. The moment the mines were
fired a whole park of siege guns opened
a concentrated fire upon the fort, which
was obscured from view by the burst
ing shells. Under cover of this wonder
ful practice a large force in the nearest
saps charged over the filled-in moat
and attacked the first line of Russian
trenches, behind which were machine
guns.
GARRISON* FIGHTS BRAVELY.
The Russians were thrown into the
greatest confusion and many of them
were killed by the exolosions. Never
theless they fought desperately, but
were not able to withstand the num
bers and determination of the Japa
nese, who passed over the broken walla
like ants in the face of a fire from the
machine guns, and the first line of
trenches was captured after twenty
minutes of awful fighting.
The fort was arranged in two levels. In
In the lower level there were in the
the lower level there were infantry in the
rear were machine gun trenches, with
a deep interior. In the center of the
higher level there were quick-firing
guns, and heavier guns in the emplace
ments. In the rear of the higher level
masonry were the concreted barracks,
the magazines and the kitchens of the
garrison.
When the Japanese captured the low
er level in the first spirited charge they
were not able to advance farther. With
splendid courage, however-, the black
masses of troops maintained their po
sition, notwithstanding an awful con
centrated fire from the fortress and
from artillery in the forts of Antze and
Etze mountains, across the gorge of the.
Shuishl Valley, and made a trench line
from the broken walls to capture the
machine gun trenches.
JAPANESE GAIN THE CREST.
All the time Japanese artillery bom
barded the rear of the fort and the
Chinese wq)l, so as to prevent the ar
rival of reinforcements. ,
At 4 o'clock In the afternoon the
Japanese massed and captured the ma
chine gun trenches and the lower sec
tion of the fort. Then they charged
the higher, level in splendid form, going,
up in twos and threes until ,a large
body had gained the crest of the north
east corner. KÂ«fore dark the walls of
the higher level were black with men,
who had gained the interior in small
parties, despite the awful fire.
Tn the meantime more of the Japan
ese gained the higher level of the fort
from the gorge at the west side. â ...
The Japanese attacked in over
whelming numbers from all sides, but
the remnant of the garrison continued
to fight with splendid spirit, contest -
ing every inch of the interior.
FEW DEFENDERS ESCAPE.
Under cover of darkness the Japan
ese Captured the last sections arid the
barracks at 3 o'clock in the morning.'
One hundred and fifty of the garrison
escaped through the connecting
trenches in the rear of the fort, which
they destroyed by mines to prevent
pursuit. Three prisoners were taken
and the others of the garrison were
killed.
The Japanese losses during the day
and night were about one thousand
killed or wounded.
With the fort the Japanese captured
four guns of large caliber, seven quick
flnlng guns and two machine guns, be
sides others not yet counted. In the
gorge at the rear of the fort they cap
tured thirty quick-firing guns which
had been mounted ready to repel any
attack upon the fort from the rear. Be
fore .retiring the Russians set fire to
the barracks and kitchens, which are
still burning.
Considering the enormous strength
of the fort, its. capture at suffh small
cost of life was a great success.

CHEFIJ, Jan. 3.âSome interesting
statistics concerning the defense of
Port Arthur were brought here by the
flotilla of Russian torpedo-boat de
stroyers, which carried numerous
chests containing complete records of
General Stoessel's army.
Originally the army numbered 35,000.
Eleven thousand have been killed) 16,000
are sick or wounded, while 8000 re
mained in the forts, of whom, however,
2000 were unable to fight.
It is learned' that when General
Stoessel wrote to General Nogi regard
ing the surrender of the fortress he
said:
I have SOOO men in the forts and 6000 of
these Â«re able to fight. If you do not accept
my proposal these men will die fighting, but it
will cost you three times their number to kill
them.
During the siege 265 per cent of the
gerrison was put out of action. This
remarkable condition was due to the
fact that wounded men kept constantly
returning to the front. Cases have been
recorded where men have gone to the
hospital seven times, returning con
valescent to the forts.
The number of officers killed was pro
portionately greater than in any battle
known to history. This was due to the
frequent lethargic condition of the men,
who without food and without sleep
moved only when led by their officers.
The Russians estimate that the tak
ing of the fortress has cost Japan $100,
--000,000.
STOESSEL ASKS QUESTIONS.
General Stoessel, despite his deter
mination not to surrender Port Arthur,
realized the gravity of the situation fol
lowing the capture of 203-Meter Hill,
from which the last Russians retired
on December 6. The sailboat which
came through a snowstorm on Decem
ber 16 with half-frozen messengers,
headed by Commander Mhszeneoff, car
ried two important dispatches. One was
addressed to St. Petersburg, asking
what were the prosnects of the arrival
of the Russian second Pacific squad
ron, and the other went to General
Kuropatkin, inquiring when relief from
the Manchurlan army would be likely.
Both disoatches stated that after an
other month Port Arthur's last defend
er v.ovid have fallen.
The authorities In St. Petersburg gave
the required information and informed
General Stoessel that he had won the
confidence of the Government and that
whatever he did would be accepted as
being for the best.
General Kuropatkin answered to the
effect that he had his hands full and
was not able to promise early relief.
The?e replies were intrusted to a mes
senger who departed six days ago. arid
it is probable that he experienced little
difficulty in eluding the blockade, which
had grown lax.
It is highly probable that the tid
ings he carried weighed materially
with General Stoessel when he ac
quiesced in the wishes of his generals
when they proposed the surrender of
the fortress.
The Russians here claim to see a
blessing in disguise in the fall of Port
Arthur. They say that the Russian
second Pacific squadron can now wait
until it is overwhelmingly reinforced
and that General Kuropatkin will be
able to manage his campaign with a
si' gle eye to his own success, without
making any false steps animated by a
desire to relieve General Stoessel.
PORT ARTHUR DESTROYED.
The fort where the negotiations for
the surrender of Port Arthur were
â held is called the Big Eagle's Nest
pnd is near Rihlung Mountain. Ac
cording to the reports of the. negotia
tions received here, Qeneral Stoessel's
proposal that the Russian sick and
wounded should remain under Russian
. rnedicaj supervision and that the Jap
anese transfer the non-combatants was
acceptable to Qeneral Nogi, but the
Russian proposal that the Russians
should march out under arms caused
some controversy. Midshipman Kliso
rich, commanding a launch which left
l'<Tt Arthur at 8 o'clock last night,
said to-day:
No shot has been fired at Port Arthur for
two days. That which Chinese heard last
night was the Russians blowing up. forts,
ships, magazines, warehouses, .docks and
everything valuable. When I left Port Arthur
the fortress and town were almost completely
wrecked. The warships died hard. Several
explosions were necessary to complete the
wrecking of them. The Sevastopol, after
catching fire, exploded and turned turtle. The
harbor entrance is blocked with sunken ships.
The only navigable craft now at Port Arthur
are the hospital ships Kassan and Mongolia.
You need expect no more ships from Port
Arthur, as they are unable to leave on account
of the blocking of the harbor.
Colonel Reiss represented General
Stoessel in the negotiations for surren
der. A table was spread with wine
and food at the Eagle's Nest and the
enemies treated one another with
great courtesy, which quickly melted
into informal good fellowship. Each
complimented the other on the bravery
of the forces.
SICK AND STARVING WARRIORS.
The statement that there remained
10,000 fighting men at Port Arthur
is misleading, because most of these
are sick or slightly wounded. For
some time there has been no supply of
bandages and wounds have been
dressed with hemp.
The news that General Stoessel was
prepared to treat for surrender was re
ceived by the soldiers with a feeling
of utihost relief.
Por the past month severe wounds
have been gladly received by the sol
diers, because they were allowed to
rest. When the men were not fighting
they were tunneling on half rations.
The bombardments of the last day or
so were terrific. Said Midshipman
Klisorich:
Even General Stoessel finally saw the fu
tility of further resistance, when our guns were
unable to reply. We might have surrendered
a month ago with the highest honor. That
resistance has continued effectively since is
scarcely less than a miracle.
It Is a mere handful of broken men who

Port Arthur Refugees De
pict Horrible Conditions
Almost Passing Belief
LONDON, Jan. 4.âThe Daily Mail's
Chofu correspondent says that Rus
sian officers who have arrived there
bring descriptions of the terrible con
ditions existing in the hospitals at
Port Arthur, which they say wrre
worse than those of the battlefield.
They relate how the Sisters of Charity,
accustomed as they are to such or
deals, sickened and fainted at their
tests because of lack of nourishment.
The wretched patients toward the end
complained bitterly of what they
called the heartlessness of the Sisters
of Charity, who grew so accustomed to
human suffering that they seemed to
lose all sympathy for the victims.
The correspondent adds:
Medicines and doctors were scarce, and the
shrinks and groans of the wounded, mingied
with the curses and yells of men who were
undergoing operations without anaesthetics,
combined to make such an inferno that it was
a relief to rush from the foul atmosphere and
horrible Sights, even if the shell-torn streets
were the only alternative.
Throughout the siege Madame
Stoessel, wife of the commander, wjis
the idol of the garrison. Madame
Stoessel was tireless in her efforts to
relieve the suffering of the sick and
wounded soldiers, and in the darkest
hours of the great war tragedy her
cheerful demeanor did much to keep
up the spirits of the men.

"BLUFFS" USED BY RUSSIANS.
Captain Kartzow, commanding the
Russian torpedo boat destroyer flotil
la which escaped from Port Arthur
and entered the harbor of Chefu Mon
day morning, tellÃ a curious story or
"bluffing" by the Russians at the be
ginning of the war, when, although
there was plenty of ammunition at
Port Arthur, there was none on the
ships under Golden Hill save blank
cartridges used for salutes.
On three occasions when the Japan
ese warships approached at long range,
the Russians opened a noisy fire with
blank ammunition, the Japanese in
each instance retiring.
Prisoners taken by the Russians re
lated that, later, after the Russian
ships had received ammunition, the
Japanese learned of the ruse and were
greatly chagrined that they had not
taken advantage of the opportunity.
"Our defense," said Captain Kart
iow. "has been replete with such
makeshifts."

Oxnard's force of lieutenants was

BARD IS WANTED.
To-morrow It will be known definite
ly whether or Â«ot Senator Bard will
come to Sacramento, and if he decides
to come, when he will be here. Lead
ers here have impressed on Senator
Bard the fact that his presence is re
quired here and in all probability he
will come. Bard's supporters are con
fident that they are holding all his
strength and have no fear of defec

readily be traced to the camps of his
opponents or to rumors circulated by
their supporters for the purpose of liv
ening things up and keeping the gos

By next Monday all the candidates
for the Senate will be* on the ground.
By that time thines should be Â«o
shaped that the strength each candi

Members of the Legislature who ad
here to the theory that the Republican
party should elect a man to represent
California in the Senate of the United
States will believe that the Southern
Pacific has "hands off" in the fight
when it orders its accredited agents
home and when they are no longer
seen climbing stairways to the rooms
of Senatorial aspirants after the ele
vators have ceased to run and the lob

MARIN COUNTY
LOSES CITIZEN
OF PROMINENCE
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 3.âHenry C.
Campbell, an old and beloved citizen of
Southern Marin County, died this
morning at his home in Sausalito. He
contracted a cold about ten days ago,
which developed into a fatal attack of
pneumonia.
Campbell resided in Sausalito for
many years and was a great favorite
in both San Francisco and Marin
County society. He owned considerable
property in Sausalito and Mill Valley
and was a director in the Tamalpais
Land Company. At one time he was
president of the Town Trustees of Sau
salito and of the Sausalito Bay Land
Company. At the time of his death
Campbell was the attorney for the San
Francisco Savings Union. He is sur
vived by a widow and five children,
Mrs. Emmet Rixford, Miss Cornelia

J. M. Weston, a United States prisoner,
in the Elko County Jail, made a saw

VANDALS DESTROY DAM
OF A MINING COMPANY
Barrier That Cost $7000, Weakened
by Dynamite, Gives Way Dur
ing Recent Storm.
NEVADA CITY, Jan. 3âThe new re
straining barrier of the Omega Mining
Company, some three miles below the
mine, was carried away a few nights
ago. The general belief is that powder
was used by unknown persons to start
the dam going, the heavy storm pre
vailing at the time doing the rest. The
barrier had been pronounced by the
Debris Commission one of the best in
the State. It was built on the crib
system of logs and rocks and cost $7000.
Everything indicates that the dam was
blown up with dynamite. The catas
trophe occurred about two hours after
the men had quit work for the day.
When the employes left the dam ap
parently was in perfect condition.

Debate on the Subject Occupies the

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3.âThe State
Federation, of Labor did not nominate
officers this afternoon, as expected, for
the reason that almost the entire aft

debate on the question of whether a
person holding a political, position, elec

ineligible to membership in the feder

be taken to-morrow, after which the
electloa of officers will occur.
Reports were submitted showing that

he murders. Its aim, as will readily be
seen, is to prevent impatient people
who think they are going to "come into
something" by some one else's death
from getting in too much of a hurry
and anticipating the l work of Welsh
rarebits or the family doctor.
"There was a case in our county only
recently," said Assemblyman Moore,
"of a young, man who killed a relative
whose heir he was with a broken pitch
er, and after serving a term for man
slaughter he is now having a fine time
with the money of the deceased.
BENEFITED BY MURDER.
"Some years ago down our way a
young man killed a relative worth $260,
--000 and spent $60,000 of it to clear him
self, and to-day he is enjoying
luxuries of life. The Weber case at
Auburn, the latest terrible murder to
shock the State, is in this category."
Rich old aunts and uncles and other
relatives who have restless heirs prob
ably will get the first real sleep and
content of their lives after Assembly
man Moose's bill becomes a law.
Legislation providing for the loaning
of State moneys to the banks and that
providing for a new system of State
taxation will have a prominent place
before this Legislature.
Waste, as usual, will introduce the
university bills, the most important be
ing one carrying an appropriation of
$250,000 for a structure for the agricul
tural college.
BURNING SHIP
SPREADS DEATH
Boilers of a Boat on Ohio
River Blow Up and Many
Perish in Sudden Fire
HUNTINGTON. W. Va., Jan. 3.âThe
boilers of the big tow boat Defender
blew up in the Ohio River near here
to-night, and of a crew*of twenty
eight only ten or twelve have been
rescued alive and they are injured. In
a very few minutes, following the ex
plosion, the big steamship was a mass
of flames, the fire even spreading to
the twenty barges in tow.
The boat was. in charge of Captain
James R. Woodruff of Pittsburg, who
was hurled into the river by the ex
plosion, but was later picked up, not
seriously injured.
The only body yet recovered and
identified is that of Thomas Duffy of
Pittsburg, a fireman. Another body is
that of a fireman from Carlpolls, Pa.,
name unknown. /
Robert Holland of Pittsburg and Jos
eph Moore of Oakland, Pa., were pick
ed up by the rescuing parties and are
now in the City Hospital. They are
horribly injured and can give no de
tails of the accident.
PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDS
FOR COMMITTING SUICIDE
Student of Rush Medical College Tires
of Being an Unwilling
Materialist,
SALT LAKE, Jan. 3.âRoyal H.
Milleron, a student of Rush Medical
College, Chicago, and a son of Dr.
Joseph Milleron of Salt Lake, com
mitted suicide in a hotel in Provo,
Utah, to-day by shooting. In a letter
found in the room he wrote:
My reasons are almost entirely ethical and
have to do with myself and relations to life.
Through scientific study and deduction and
rather extensive philosophical reading I have
unhappily come to believe that all the so
called supernatural is pure fallacy. This forces
me into the position of an unwilling material
ist and mbs existence of its highest attrac
tions. I believe the human life to be at the
disposal of Its owner. I choose to stop mineâ
that i 3 all. >*
The only remorse I feel Is In snapping the
ties of love which bind me to parents and
sisters. Pear 1 do not feel at all. It Is no
part of a philosopher to feel fearâthat Is for
the ignorant and uninformed. If publicity
could be avoided in such a case I should be
pleased; but as a citizen of the world I realize
the Impossibility of the realization of such
hopes.
This might be called a case of justifiable
homicide. I have merely killed a man who
has been interfering with my contentment and
peace of mind beyond endurance. The man
is myself. If I should write a book I could
not offer any more convincing proof to the
average person than these few pages contain
that I am a fool. Well, so be It; I do not
think so myself.
Knowledge of Milleron's death came
through a letter to his father in Salt
Lake, announcing his intention. The
father at once telephpned to the Provo
Hotel and the discovery of the body
followed.
Two sisters of Milleron are members
of the Bostonian opera company.
HUNTINGTON MAKES GIFT
TO SOUTHERN METHODISTS
Presents the Church With Ten Acres
of Land Valued at
$20,000.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3.âHenry E.
Huntington has made the Southern
California Methodist Conference a gift
of a ten-acre tract in the heart of the
seaside town of Huntington Beach.
This donation is worth at least 120,000
and will be used as a site for the an
nual camp-meetings and the confer
ence. Huntington thus brings about
the shifting of the base of Methodism
in this end of the State, Long Beach
having for years had all these gather
ings. To make it sure; the Huntington
Beach Board of Trade adds to Hunt
ington's offer a bonus of $5000 cash,
which will be used in starting the
necessary buildings. It is said this is
Huntington's first gift of consequence
to any religious denomination.

Drew will also ask an appropriation
of $100,000 for a road into the Kings

BUNKERS ADMITTED.
Republican Delegation In Caucus
Recognizes Labor Party Senator.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3. âAt a
caucus of the Republican Senatorial
delegation this morning Senator Harry
Bunkers, who was elected by the
Union Labor party, was admitted by
the Republicans to their circle.
Bunkers addressed the caucus and
said that though it was trite he had
been elected by the Union Labor party
and indorsed by the Democrats, he
had always been a Republican, and
the position he occupied in the recent
fight in San Francisco was due solely
to local conditions. He said he had
always voted the Republican national
ticket and that he intended to vote
for a Republican for United States
Senator.
This statement was taken as suffi
cient evidence of good faith by the
Republicans and they unanimously ad
mitted him to their ranks to have
equal voice in any caucus that may
be held in the future.

The first officer, who was on the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BURLINGTON, N. J., Jan. 3.âDe
nying with almost his last breath to
day that he had any wealth other than
the home in which he lived and the
spacious grounds that surround his
residence, Firman Dubel, it is now es
timated, left an estate worth between
$300,000 and $500,000. After his
death his relatives made a search of
the Dubel premises, which resulted
in the finding of more than $9000 in
gold, silver and moth-eaten paper bills,
chieiiy of the denomination of $100.
Stored in dusty recesses and out of
the way nooks, laid between leaves of
books, /which were carelessly placed
in unlocked receptacles, and hidden
beneath carpets, this money was found
and the relatives are confident that
they have merely begun their dis
coveries of treasure. In a peck meas
ure in the room in which there was
countless rubbish there was $1700." In
another place a cigar box held $2500
in gold. A thin book, merely a pam
phlet, contained between thirty-eight
consecutive leaves thirty-eight $100
bills. Old clothing in various trunks
and closets had been receptacles.
Living the life of a recluse for a
score of years and having as his corns
panion a housekeeper, who was his
ward, Dubel was known by the resi
dents to have considerable money, de
spite his vigorous denials. A search
among the old papers brought to light
scores of mortgages upon the property
of residents of the town and of the
country for miles around. For years
Dubel had lived on a fare that caused
some to wonder how he kept his body
and soul together. He owned much
real estate in this town and several
aged and needy tenants have lived in
these buildings for years without pay
ing rent. The sideboard in his home
was stocked with rows of old-fash
ioned china and quantities of silver,
but they were never used. Dubel and
his housekeeper preferring to eat and
drink from common earthenware.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
CONTRA COSTA
IS NOT READY
Declines to Submit Estimate of
Value of Plant to Council,
Willing to Let Court Decide
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.âThe Contra
Costa Water Company to-night,
through W. H. Chickering, its attorney,
submitted to the City Council a letter
rejecting the Council's invitation to
place a valuation upon its plant as a
preliminary move toward obtaining the
vote of the people on the question of
purchasing the system for a municipal
water supply. The company's reasons
as set forth by Attorney Chickering
follow:
"I submit that by the terms of the
resolution the possible acquisition of
the Contra Costa plant is not to be sub
mitted to the voters unless the valua
tion placed upon it by the company
shall not be deemed excessive by your
selves. That is, you, not the voters,
are to be the sole judges of value. This
value you have already determined to
be a sum less than the company will
consent to accept. It therefore seems
unfair to the company to submit to
you, as judges, a valuation which your
former action would compel you to re
ject."
As a counter offer the company says
it stands ready to join with the city in
seeking "the judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction as to the value
of its plant by condemnation or any

The Alameda County voting machine
case was of interest to the entire State,
for here the Columbia Voting Machine
Company and the United States Stand
ard Voting Machine Company locked
horns for a contract involving a little
less than $76,000. The United States
Standard was represented by Supreme
Court Clerk Frank C. Jordan and the
Columbia was represented by State
Senator F. W. Leavitt. The latter ma
chine, while manufactured in Indiana,
is really an Oakland invention, having
been originated by a man named Chris
tensen, who was backed by Oakland
capital. Jordan lost and Leavitt won,
and the Columbia machine was or
dered.
Then came a battle that did not end
until to-day. In the East there were
injunctions, suits for infringement of
patents, charges and counter charges,
the echoes of which were heard in "Oak
land. Last October Supervisor H. D.
Rowe, who had opposed the Columbia
machine, presented a resolution revok
ing the contract upon the ground that
the machines had not been supplied
within a reasonable time. A state
ment was then made by the repre
sentatives of the Columbia company to
the effect that they were tied up by
suits and offering to supply another
machine. Supervisor Rowe to-day
called up that resolution, and the vote
to revoke the unfulfilled contract was
unanimous.
What the Columbia people will do
in the future is still a question, as
they have made no statement of their
position.
The Board of Supervisors was or
ganized for the new year to-day By
re-alecting John Mitchell chairman and
reappointing all of the old committees.
WATER COMPANY MUST SHOW
WHY MAINS WERE EMPTY
.Judge Ellsworth Molds That Niehaus
Brothers Have Made Out Cause
For Action.
OAKLAND, Jan. 3.âAfter consid
eration of the briefs submitted in the
suit of the Niehaus Brothers Com
pany against the Contra Costa Water
Company for $146,000 damages, on a
motion for a nonsuit, Judge Ells
worth decided to-day that he would
deny the motion and allow the case
â to proceed, thus requiring the water
company to put in a defense to the
charges of lack of water made in the
complaint.
Attorneys Samuel Knight and M. C.
Chapman, in behalf of the water com
pany, made the motion for a non
suit. Judge Ellsworth held that there
was a contractural relation between
the water company and Niehaus
Brothers and that apparently this had
been violated. The trial of the case
will be resumed next Monday.

PUBLIC MIND
IS IMPARTIAL
Motion Denied for Change of
Venue Made on Behalf of
Prisoner David Kiniry
Oakland Office San 'Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 3.
David Kiniry can be given a fair and
impartial trial in Alameda County, was
the decision of Judge Greene to
day. He denied the motion made for
a change of venue. In the hearing of
the matter this afternoon Attorneys
Paere and Gentry pointed to the crowd
ed courtroom as evidence of the un
usual interest taken in the case, but
when called into chambers by Judge
Greene, who proposed that the doors
be locked on the crowd and each asked
in regard to his qualifications to sit as
a Juror, they were not willing to sub
mit the matter to such a test.
In order to support the claim that the
local press had already tried and con
victed Kiniry, twenty different news
paper articles touching upon the case
were read. Against these District At
torney Allen presented an affidavit
from Chief of Police Hodgkins, who
had Kiniry in custody for some weeks;
another by Police Judge Mortimer
Smith, a brother of James H. Smith,
whom Kiniry is accused of having
murdered, and another by Courtroom
Clerk Lester C. McNulty to the effect
that from what they'had seen and their
different points of view there was no
reason why Kiniry could not be given
an impartial trial here, and this view
was coincided in by Judge Greene.
Kiniry's trial was then set for Febru
ary 27.

JEWELRY TAKEN
BY BOLD THIEF
Plague of Petty Robberies
in Some of the Lodging-
Houses of University Town
WOMEN LOSE VALUABLES
Watches, Rings, Money and
Other Possessions Removed
by Daring Room Operator
BERKELEY, Jan B.âAn epidemic of
robberies in the principal lodging
houses of Berkeley on the downtown
streets has convinced the police and the
victims, too, that a systematic cam
paign is being carried out by a daring
room thief in the college town, who
during the last few weeks has rifled
the rooms of a half-dozen families, get
ting a quantity of jewelry, money and
other valuables.
Six of these affairs have been re
ported to Marshal Kerns during the
last few days. Mrs. Alice Berry, re
siding in the Golden Sheaf building on
Shattuck avenue, was robbed of a dia
mond and opal ring, a gold ring and a
gold watch last Saturday afternoon.
She had left her room to go on the roof
of the building and In her absence the
valuables were taken. At about the
same time Mrs. Anna Hartley's room,
on the same floor, was rifled of a quan
tity of silver. Mrs. Alice Gardner, in
the Thomas block on Center street, lost
a gold watch, several valuable rings
and a saving bank nearly full of money
last Sunday night.
The room of Odachi Jeiku, a Jap
anese, in the Thomas block, was de
spoiled of several articles the same
night, Including a small sum of money.
Millard Matthews, a grocery store
solicitor, with rooms in the Thomas
block, was robbed last week of a num
ber of rings while he and his wife were
in Oakland. Gus Bemal, In the same
building, missed from his rooms recent
ly a feather boa valued at $40.
MATRIMONY THE
NEW YEAR RAGE
ABOUT OAKLAND
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLÂ«ANI>, Jan. 3.âThere must be some
thing peculiarly conducive to matrimony in the
atmosphere of the city of oaks, or else Oak
land girls are more than ordinarily fascinating.
Personal experience inclines to the latter be
lief, but, whatever the cause, certain It Is
that the city la becoming famed for the num
ber ot important marriages that take place
here.
Although only three days old. the new year
has already been prolific of interesting an
nouncements, and still they come.
The latest to make known her approaching
marriage is Miss Leila McKlllic&n, one of the
prettiest and most charming of Oakland's
maids. Her fiance is an Eastern man. Waiter
Boyd Townsend, and they make a very attrac
tive couple, as he is a splendid looking fellow.
Miss Mcklllican is the daughter or Robert Mc-
Kiilican, one time Sheriff of Alameda County.
Her fiance is the son of Henry Townsend, gen
eral manager of the Oould railroad lines in
St. Louis, and the young groom is also in the
same company's employ, being traveling
freight and passenger agent for the .Denver
and Hlo Grande, with headquarters In San
Francisco.
The wedding will follow close upon the an
nouncement of the engagement, a date in
February having been selected, and the newly
married pair will include St. Louis in the very
interesting wedding itinerary they have
planned.
Misa McKilllcan's many girl friends will be
delighted to learn that Mr. Townsend intends
building a handsome home In Alameda. He is
lond of nautical sports and will probably man
a pleasure yacht betore many moons.
â¢ â¢ â¢
As many another talented girl has done.
Miss Klsa Hunt has abandoned all thought ot
a musical career to wed the man of her choice.
Clarence B. Munaon, a young business man of
San Francisco, is the lucky individual who
has diverted the singer's mind from music to
matrimony. Miss Hunt has a contralto voice
of unusual range, and alter receiving a good
start under the careiui tutelage oÂ£ Mrs. Biake
Alverson she went to Boston, where she at
tracted attention as a pupil in the Conserva
tory of Music there. For two years before
her return to Oakland, a tew months ago, she
studied with William L>. Whitney in the In
ternational School for Vocalists.
Miss Hunt is the only daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. George W. Hunt of this city, and the
weddlrw, tor which no date has yet been set,
will probably be a large church affair.

Nearly all of fashionable Oakland partici
pated in the charity tea at Mrs. Coghlli's yes
terday alternoon. As it was a holiday, wives
took their husbands, and maids their
sweethearts, in tow and the sight of dozens of
black coats in the assembly of feminine tea
drinkers waa a pleasant and unusual sight.
If the men only realized how the women enjoy
these visitsâwhich are really like angels',
they are so few and far betweenâthey would
develoo abnormal appetites for afternoon tea.
Mrs. Coghlll is a charming hostess always
and her own gracious efforts were agreeably
seconded yesterday by the coterie of ladies as
sisting. Music âand good music by Mrs. Max
well Taft and Miss Elsie Cahillâadded greatly
to the day"s pleasure, and the many guests
who contributed by their presence to the suc
cess of the affair expressed their satisfaction
enthusiastically.
Some of the smartest gowns seen this winter
were worn at the tea, Mrs. George H. Wheaton
lookins very handsome in a black velvet
gown, and Crissle Taft was perfectly stunning
in a black crepey affair trimmed with tiny
roses.
The tea was for the benefit of St. Paul's
Guild fund. It netted a pleasing sum.
Soma of the young girls who assisted the
ladles of the guild were Miss Gertrude Gould
Miss Jane Crellln, Miss Ethel Crelltn Miss
Irene Bangs. Miss Maud Edith Pope, Miss Ann

COURT ROLES
FOR J. J. HILL
E. H. Harriman Loses Suit in
Which Northern Securities
Stock Is Cause of Action
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 3.âThe
United States Court of Appeals for the
Third Judicial District, in an opinion
filed here to-day, reverses a decision
of the New Jersey Circuit Court, which
restrainod the Northern Securities
Company from distributing certain
stock of the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company. The decision is a defeat
for the interest represented by E. H.
Harriman.
By a decree of the New Jersey court
the Northern Securities Company was
restrained from disposing of 370,320
shares of the common stock of the
Northern Pacific Railway Company, al
leged to have been received from E. H.
Harriman and Winslow S. Pierce, and
of 347,090 shares of - the common stock
of the Northern Pacific Railway Com
pany received by the Northern Securi
ties Company from the Northern Paci
fic Company. To-day's decision, how
ever, gives the Northern Securities
Company the right to dispose of the
stock.
Harriman and Pierce, when the
Northern Securities Company had been
declared by the United States Supreme
Court to be an illegal combination, de
manded the return of the original stock
they had contributed at the time of the
organization of the combination. The
Northern Securities Company, it was
claimed, Intended to make a pro rata
distribution of the stock of the con
tributing companies. The opinion was
written by Judge Dallas.
NEW YORK, Jan. 3.â E. H. Harri
man, when shown the bulletin an
nouncing the decision of the court in
the Northern Securities case, said:
"The matter now has been before
four Judges and so far it is an even
division, two having declared for us
and two against us."
Harriman declined to say anything
further regarding the case.
J. J. Hill was seen at his office. He
said he was pleased, but not surprised
at the decision. There will pc no haste,
he said, in distributing the assets of
the Northern Securities Company. He
was asked:
"Does this mean a settlement?"
"Why, yes, the court settles it."
Hill was asked whether there would
be a meeting of the opposing interests
as a result of to-day's decision. He
said he knew of no reason for such a
meeting. Hill was reminded that Schiff
had appeared before the directors of
the Northern Securities Company last
summer with a settlement proposition.
To this Hill replied that Schiff on that
occasion showed that he stood alone in
his attitude.

has proved a great success.
The little one Is the child of Mrs.
Wills, who was admitted to the in
firmary about a month ago, and it is
now 1 week old. Soon after the
birth of the baby Dr. Clark decided
that artificial means must be used to
preserve its life, and as there was no
regular baby hatcher at the infirmary
he was forced to try the chicken in
cubator for the purpose.
At birth the baby weighed but three
pounds, but with careful attention it
has thrived during its short existence
and now weighs four pounds.
ADAMS STILL
IN THE FIGHT
He Says He Will Stay With
Contest Until All Hope of
Success Has Disappeared
DENVER, Jan. 3.âAt noon to-mor
row the Legislature, which will settle
the gubernatorial contest between
Governor Peabody and Alva Adams,
will be called to order. It is expected
that all of to-morrow will be required
for the work of organization and that
no action bearing on the governorship
will be taken.!
It is practically certain that the first
thing that will be done by the Senate
after it is in working order will be
the unseating of Senators Robert M.
Born of Alamosa and Daniel Healey
of Leadville. Their seats will be given
to the Republicans, James B. Dick
and Jesse McDonald. The latter is
Lieutenant Governor elect and will re
tain his seat as Senator only until
such time as he is sworn into office.
The makeup of the Legislature will
be at the opening to-morrow and With
out reference to any of the contests:
Senate, Republicans, 19; Democrats,
15; House, Republicans, 47; Democrats,
18; on joint ballot. Republicans 66,
Democrats 33.
No intimation was given by the Su
preme Court this afternoon as to the
time when it would hand down its de
cision on the application of Alva
Adams to have the ballot boxes used
at the last election in this city ex
amined, but by the attorneys on both
sides it is believed that announce
ment will be made by the court in the
morning.
The attorneys for Adams made this
morning a strong effort to have the
inquiry confined te the ballot boxes
only, and urged that it be not extend
ed to the registration slips and the
poll books. An Inquiry of this magni
tude, they contended, would consume
the greater part of a year and would
entail expenses which could not at this
time be even estimated.
Attorney Hersey for the Republi
cans, insisted that the full scope of the
alleged frauds could not be shown by
an examination of the baHot boxes
only, and declared that if Adams was
unable to endure half the expenses
of the inquiry the Republicans would
stand all the expense.
The Democratic plans are dependent
upon the line of action taken by the
Republicans, but Adams said to-day
that he would continue to fight until
there was absolutely no hope of suc
cess.

SCOUTS STORY OF DIVINE
ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH
Professor Says It Is Result of Chemi
cal Processes and Secret Will
Soon Be Known.
CHICAGO, Jan. 3.âHundreds of
University of Chicago medical students
gathered in the physiological lecture
room to-day and heard Dr. A. P. de
Mathews, professor of physiological
chemistry, declare that there was no
such thing as a divine creation of
Eden.
The Bible references were taken for
naught by Professor de Mathews. The
story of the creation of Adam and
Eve. he declared, was mythical. He
refused to consider it. He stated his
belief that only real chemical forms,
acting under certain physical condi
tions, could produce life. Said Dr. de
Mathews:
There is no such thing as a "divine origin
of life. Life is on a purely physical and
chemical basis. Certain chemical, substances
came together under certain physical condi
tions and the result was life.
I believe that It is possible to create life.
There Is no doubt In my mind but that in a
short time real life will be produced. Won
derful advances have been made In physiolo
gical chemistry in the last decade. It is now
only a question of a short time before some
scientist will discover the process of the final
stage. J _

DENT LICENSE
FOR BAY STATE
Police Commission Insists
on Exacting Regulations
for French Restaurants
A renewal of the liquor license of
the Bay State cafe was denied by the
Police Commissioners last night be
cause the proprietor refused to remove
the doors and beds from the private
rooms on the upper floors of his es
tablishment. N. M. Adler, who has
a small fortune in fitting up the
place and whose lease at $1500 a month
has nine years more to run, pleaded
that he was conducting a hotel, that
lie needed the private rooms and beds
for his patrons, as does the Palace Ho
'i r for its guests. Attorney Rosenthal
reinforced his argument, setting forth
that in his opinion the commission was
going beyond all bounds of reason in
trying to make a Puritan city of San
Francisco." But their pleadings were
in vain, for Commissioners Hutton
. and Reagan declared themselves
t-trongly for a "wide-open house,"
where there can be no trysting place
;:nd no seclusion from the peering eyes
that are calculated to enforce morality.
Commissioners Drinkhouse and How
ell tried to save Adler from the ruin
of his business, but the votes of their
two colleagues were sufficient to deny
his application. Reagan and Hutton,
from their manner and statements, are
evidently determined in their campaign
against the French restaurants. The
licenses of Delmonico's and the Old
Poodle Dog are in Jeopardy, for they
are up for renewal and the hearings
will be held next Tuesday night.
Pedro Carrere of the Old Poodle
lx>g explained to the board that he
had replaced the doors of his rooms
Â« Hh portieres, but Reagan and Hutton
said that would not do and that the
hearing must go on at the next meet
ing.
Attorney Rosenthal wag vigorous in
bis argument in behalf of the Bay
State, and twice made the statement
that Commissioner Hutton had visited
the Stockton-street resort. The Com
missioner was not to be baited, how
ever, for he calmly but emphatically
denied the statements and wound up
with a request that personalities bÂ«
eliminated. Rosenthal contended that
the strict regulations being laid down
by the commission only tended to
"make drunkenness and crime ram
pant."
"There Is no other city In the United
States where such places as the Bay
State, the Poodle Dog, Delmonico's and
others are allowed to exist," asserted
Hutton. "It is true that conditions in
San Francisco are not what they ought
to be," he added, "but we are doing
the best we can in the way of police
regulations to stop drunkenness and
crime."
When the eases of Sergeants Ellis,
Brophy and Fraher and of Patrolmen
Henry Heinz, Doran. O'Brien, MeGrath
and Munn were called, all of whom
were charged by Commissioner Hutton
with participation in corruption in
Chinatown, a communication was read
from District Attorney Byington ask
ing that the accused be not called to
testify until the Grand Jury finishes
its investigation.
"The cases are set peremptorily for
hearing next Tuesday night," an
nounced Chairman Howell. The Com
missioners do not purpose to delay

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1905.
AIMS A BLOW
AT THE PRESS
Governor of Pennsylvania
Asks the Legislature to
Adopt Repressive Measures
HARRISBURG, Pa., Jan. B.âGov
ernor Pennypacker, in his message to
the Legislature, recommends the im
position of a "slight tax upon each
ton of coal mined, the proceeds of the
tax to be used only in the construc
tion of roads or in the maintenance of
schools."
A great part of the message is de
voted to the press and the Governor
recommends more stringent legislation
for its control. In part he says:
Further legislation 1* required for the pro
tection of the commonwealth from the Injury
to her reputation and the disadvantage to the
administration of her affairs which arise from
the prevalent dissemination of scandalous in
ventions concerning her officials and their ef
forts in her behalf. It la not only an un
seemly spectacle, but it is a crime, which
the State ought to punish when day after
day the Mayor of one of her cities la depicted
In communion with a monster, compounded
from illustratlona of Cope's Palaeontology and
Dore's "Dante."
In the large cities what Is popularly called
"yellow journalism" Is gaining a foothold.
There la a daily newspaper of wide circulation,
published In the city of Philadelphia, osten
sibly by a Pennsylvania corporation.
Since its control of what had been a useful
and venerable newspaper began every Mayor
o: Philadelphia, every Governor, every United
States Senator, save one, who has only been
In office four weeks, and every legislator
of the commonwealth has been subjected to a
drily flood in Its columns, not of adverse
comment, but of invented untruths.
All of the people, proprietor and peasant,
churchman and heathen, are concerned alike
that a deliberate policy of false report to se
cure 111-gotten gain should not succeed. . What
Is the remedy? Sooner or later one must be
provided.
Under the English common law when a
woman habitually made outcries of scandala
upon the public highways to the annoyance
of the neighborhood she was held to be a
common scold and a public nuisance. Any
body may abate a public nuisance and she
was punished by being ducked In a neighbor
inn pond.
It has been held that the law of common
â colda la retained In Pennaylvanla, though
the punishment la by fine and imprisonment.
I suggest the application of this legal prin
ciple to the habitual publication of scandalous
untruths.
The Governor then outlines "an act
declaring the habitual publication and
dissemination by newspapers, journal?,
periodicals, pamphlets or circulars of
falsehood, defamation and scandal to
be a public nuisance and providing for
the abatement thereof" by suppress
ing the offending newspaper.
SUPREME COURT DECIDES
AGAINST J. J. MOORE & CO.
Favors the Government" In Case
Growing Oat of a Coal Order in
San Francisco.
WASHINGTON. Jan. B.âln an opin
ion rendered by Justice McKenna, the
Supreme Court of the United States
to-day decided the case of John J.
Moore & Co. of San Francisco vs. the
United States adversely to Moore.
The case involved a claim for demur
rage on account of delay In delivering
coal to the order of the Government
in San Francisco. The court holds that
the Government was not liable, thus
affirming the judgment of the Court
of Claims. The lower court was, how
ever, reversed on another point in the
case, involving the quantity of coal.

SEQUOIA CLUB
CONVENES IN ITS
NEW QUARTERS
The Sequoia Club convened with a
small but very congenial representa
tion last evening in Its temporary home
in the Palace Hotel.
Perhaps just a tinge of homesickness
pervaded for the customary haunt at
the St. Francis, but the atmosphere was
conducive to cozy chatting, which waa
plentiful, there being no "Hon" to shed
luster on the general assembly.
An occasional observation disclosed
among others Sir Charles Tupper,
Charles Aiken, Mr. and Mrs. Fremont

E. Huntington, Miss Eleanor Connell,
Miss Ednah Robinson, Mr. and Mrs.
Keating, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Deerlng,

and Mrs. Elizabeth Gerberding.
Pending the arrangements for a per
manent home the Sequoians may be
very comfortable In the pretty suite,
186-187, on the second floor, New Mont
gomery street side. The adjustment in
the meantime to new surroundings will
be easy among so much camaraderie as
exists in this combination of art-loving
beings.

BARKENTINE HAWAII TAKES FIRE AT SEA
San Francisco Ves
sel Ends Event
ful Voyage.
She Reaches Kobe
in Spite of Gales
and Flames.
Stranded Steamer
Abydos Is Once
More Afloat.
The barkentine Hawaii of this port
arrived yesterday at Kobe arter a voy
age which wind, water and Are had
conspired to make eventful. Through
this war of the "elements the stout
â¢ sailing ship emerged with compara
tively few scars. Hind, Rolph & Co.,
.the owners, are again congratulating
themselves that the little god of luck
continues to follow their flag.
The Hawaii was loaded with fertil
izer from Killisnoo. She encountered
a full share of the heavy weather
which at this time of year makes navi
gation Ip. Oriental waters full of dan
.ger. The wind ripped six sails to I
ribbons and a heavy sea, one of many
that threw its weight across the
barkentlne's decks, damaged her
wheel. To add to the burden of the
Hawaii's crew the vessel took fire,
and for anxious hours the sailormen
faced the possibility of having their
floating home burned under their feeL
The flames were subdued, however,
and the Hawaii yesterday entered the
harbor of Kobe.
As far as can be seen now the
damage done by the flames was slight,
but the full extent of the havoc
wrought by the fire will not be known
until the discharging of the cargÂ«
permits a more thorough examination.
Has Big Cable on Board.
Part of the cargo of the British ship Hutton
Hall, which arrived December 22 from Liver
dool. is a large cable for the local telephone
company. This cable wMghs twenty-one tons
and some difficult) is expected !n landing it.
It will have to be hoisted from the ship by the
aid of shear legs rigged on the dock and it is
feared that such a concentrated strain would
.be more than the planking ot an ordinary
wharf will stand. It Is probable that the
Hutton Hail will be towed to the Union Iron
Works, where the Gear usej In handling the
big guns and heavy castings for battleships
will make light work oi transferring the cable
from the vessel's hold to the truck on which
It will be taken uptown.
Abydos Is Again Afloat.

Aged and Eccentric Gun

to Salvation Army and Dies
TAKES POISON AND GAS
Writes Businesslike Notes
to the Coroner and Others
and Then Kills Himself
j Aged and eccentric, F. R. Koenig,
! who did business as gunsmith, lock
smith and machinist at 704 Valencia
street and lived in the rear of the shop,
; wrote letters on New Year's day to the
Salvation Army, Coroner Iceland and
M. H. Fredericks announcing his Inten
tion to kill himself. The letters were
j found yesterday in his pockets when
his body was discovered by the police.
Neighbors telephoned to the police
| yesterday forenoon that Koenig's shop
had not been opened and that they
I feared something had happened to the
old man. The police forced an entrance
and discovered the rooms full of illu
minating gas escaping from a small
pantry closet adjoining the kitchen.
Here the body of Koenig was seated in
a chair. He had bored a hole in the
partition between the closet and the
kitchen. Affixing one end of a rubber
I tube to the gasburner in the kitchen,
|he had pushed the other end of the
tube into the hole In the wall and
turned on the gas. Then he seated him
self In the chair in the .closet, swal
lowed a half-glass of water in which
cyanide had been dissolved and speed
ily died.
In the note to the Coroner Koenig
says: "I have gone out of this material
world of trouble by the cyanide and
gaa road. â¢ * â¢ Wishing you a hap
py New Year, yours, F. R. Koenig."
The letter to the Salvation Army
reads as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 1, 1905.
Headquarters Salvation Army, San Fran
ciscoâl have Joined the army of Jesus last
night and to-day I hope to be in heaven with
Jesus. This my last will is that you take
possession of all tin tools and books and all
other things which you find in my place of
business, 704 Valencia street. I will every
thing I got to be used for the benefit of the
army.
Another letter to M. H. Fredericks,
secretary of Petaluma Grove No. 38, U.
A. O. D., was found. It begins as fol
lows: "When you receive this letter I
will be spending my New Year's in
Walhalla. My eyes were very dim; I
could not do my work as I wanted to
do " He desires that his body should
be cremated in this city.
Koenig was a native of Germany,
about â¬0 years old and was n<uv known
to have any relatives in this country.
NOOSE AWAITS
JOHN H. WOOD
Supreme Court Thinks That
the Bloodthirsty Desperado
Should Die on Scaffold
John H. Wood, the ringleader of the
band of convicts that madcthe famous
break from Foisom penitentiary on
July 27, 1903, must die on the rcaffold,
according to a decision rendered by
the Supreme Court yesterday. The
crime ot which the nuted outlaw was
convicted and for which he must
hang was the murder of J. Festus
Rutherford at the Grand Victory mine
five days after the escape. The de- 1
fendant said he was not present when ;
the murder was committed, but the j
court holds the circumstantial evi
dence apainst him was sufficiently I
strong to justify conviction.
Wood originated the scheme of seiz
ing the prison officials and using them i
as shields in order to get past the
guards in the towers. After the fight ,
at Pilot Hill Wood, Theron, Murphy. !
Miller and Eldridge separated from the
rest of the gang of fugitives and start
ed due east for the Sierras.
The party was seen in the vicinity
of Shank's Exchange and the alarm
was sent to Placerville, the nearest
town. Eight National Guardsmen in :
command of Lieutenant Smith imme
diately started in pursuit of the much
wanted felons.
The tracks of the escapes were
fQUnd leading up Manzanita Hill, back i
of the Grand victory mine, and the {
militiamen advnnced in skirmish order. |
The convicts had sighted their pur- !
suers, but were too weary to go far- i
ther. As the freemen came closer the i
desperadoes lay behind a log and, with j
guns ready, waited for the foe to ap- !
pear. When the pursuers were within j
twenty feet ot' their hiding place the j
felons opened Pre. Militiamen Ruth- j
erford and Jones were instantly Killed j
and another one of the freemen was :
shot through the lungs. The other five j
guardsmen, of whom Rutherford's j
brother was one. fled precipitately in
bae direction, Avhile the convicts ran I
another way.
Within an hour 300 men had sur
rounded the hill, but the convicts were
miles away. That night another free
man was shot and killed through be
in? mistaken for a convict. The fugi
tives left an opera-glass, a revolver,
some clothin? and cooking utensils on
the hill, and throutrh these Wood was
shown to have been one of the party. <
Wood was caught in Reno while in j
search of opium. Murphy was cap- 1
tured in the same neighborhood. Mil- I
ler was Bften and shot at, but he es- !
caped. Theron and Eldridge are still I
ainone the missing.
Wood was tried in Bacramento for
the murder of Guard Cotter at the '
prison Rnd was convicted, but his pun- j
ishment was fixed at life imprisonment.
As he was alrtady under sentence for I
life for highway robbery committed in 1
San Francisco, the punishment was
deemed inadequate and he was taken
to Placerville to be tried on the charge
of murdering Rutherford. While on >
trial in that city a plot to let him es- i
cape was hatched and almost consum- '
mated by the wife of a prominent El j
Dorado County official. Wood is now j
it Folsom in a dungeon, where he will i
remain until that fateful morning
when the Warden shall summon him
to don the black cap.
Sues United Railroads.
Max Weinstein brought suit yester
day in the Justices' Court against the
United Railroads of San .Francisco and
the Presidio and Ferries Railroad to
recover $299 and costs for injuries
sustained by him. During a collision
between a Montgomery avenue car
and a Kearny street, car, on November
19, Weinstein alleges that his foot waa
crushed and rendered permanently
useless. He alleges also that the acci
dent waa due Xo the negligence of the
railroad's employees.

JUDGE BEATTY S OPINION.
Chief Justice Beany when he wu
asked for an opinion yesterday desig- '<
nating the two men whose services en- 1
titled them to be considered pre
eminent looked up with surprise, for
the request embodied the necessity for
immediately placing in critical review 1
the events of two centuries In this
State. He removed his glasses and j
with a quizzical look said:
"The case is taken under advisement!
for ninety days."
Chief Justice Beatty's first choice is :
. Colonel Baker. He was a patriot in
, peace. He proved his devotion to his 1
â¢ country by laying down his life for it.
Ia part Justice Beatty said:
I have Mill heard the equal of Baker for
'Ucuenee. His literary taste was exquisite.
He was distinguished for eloquence and
scholarship, for gallantry and patriotism. It
is tru* that he went from California to Oregon
and was elected United States Senator from
Oregon. It Is also true that he was a citizen
of Illinois he fought in the Mexican
war. But he has been claimed and is claimed
hv California. He was a handsome man and
hid statue would look well.
Padre Juniporo Serra waa a pioneer. He
ir.ight be commemorated if it is possible to
u-t an authentic picture of him as a guide
foe a statue. But even if there is no authentic
picture an artist, a true artist, perceiving the
spirit of the man and the significance of the
occasion, could do much toward making a
i ti-factory portraiture. Serra and Baker
weald do very well.
Attorney *E. S. Plllsbury was asked
to make his selection of two Califor
nians who have performed the most
eminent service for the State. "Ah,"
said Pillsbury, "that is a very large
question. I would not care to commit
myself offhand. I will say that Pro
fessor Joseph Lie Conte is worth con
sidering, and Baker deserving. I am:
going East to-morrow and have not the
time that I would require to think the
matter over carefuly and fully."
Even more impressed with the inter
esting inquiry was Attorney Horace G.
Piatt. He listened attentively to a
statement relative to the historical duty
that is about to devolve upon the Cali
fornia Legislature and promised to con
sider the matter, but he could not make
any answer at once.
EX-MAYOR POND'S CHOICE.
E. B. Pond, formerly Mayor of San
Francisco, president of the San Fran
cisco Savings Union and connected
widely with many interests in Califor
nia, was also interested intensely, but
found that there had been so many his
torical persons in this State deserving
of fame that he was unable to choose
at once.
Padre Serra and James Marshall were
the choice of ex-Congressman S. D.
Woods. "California could not have had
Its present history in the absence of
either," said Mr. Woods.
Henry Payot introduced the name of
William C. Broderick, United States
Senator from California. He also fa
vored William T. Coleman because
Coleman was the president of the
vigilance committee that hanged Casey
for the murder of James King of Wil
liam, the earliest editor of the San
Francisco Bulletin.
' Coleman and King." said Payot,
"strove nobly to purify the atmosphere
of public life in San Francisco, and
their example was salutary for all Cal
ifornia. They were makers of history."
Congressman Julius Kahn said
promptly and without hesitation that
Junipero Serra and the Rev. Starr
King were his choices. "Serra was the
pioneer of civilization for California.
Where he placed missions there are
thriving California towns and cities to
day, and their names commemorate his
deeds and sagacity. Starr King by his
eloquence saved California to the Un
ion."
J. A. Filcher, California commissioner
to the St. Louis Exposition, said that
his choice rested on United States Sen-

GADSKI CHARMS
AS DOES HEINK
Shows in Sopratno Field the
'Same Magic Other Queen
Has as World's Contralto
Last night at the Alhambra Madame
Gadski fulfilled all the large promise
of her singing with the Metropolitan
Opera Company here three years ago.
Three years ago she represented a
splendid promise and a problem. To
day the promise is fulfilled and the
problem solved. Three years from now
may find Gadski another Schumann-
Heinkâat the soprano end of the song
âthan which I can find nothing nobler
to say of her.
Schumann-Heink herself, for the
gripping, human quality of the thing,
might have been at the singing of the
Franz "Aus meinen grossen Schmer
zen." The song had the same grace of
seeming to flower into sound for the
first time for youâof coming directly
from the producer to the consumer, as
the economists would say. So also, as
singing itself, came the "Die Haide ist
braun." One was rather proud of the
audience here. Gadski herself, too, did
the exquisitely right thing. The two
songs, perhaps best sung of the whole
programme from the sheerly human
(and that is from the highest) side,
drew an admirably appreciative enthu
siasm. Gadski, in her serene and gra
cious fashion, repeated both, and sang
both the second time with the full de
light of him who sings unafraid to the
understanding heart. One was glad to
be there for the charming Tightness of
the whole incident.
The whole programme was a compli
ment to the audience. Schumann.
Schubert, Mo*art, Franz, Beethoven,
Jensen, Weber, at their best, were the
composers represented. One finds Gad
ski this season doing altogether the de
sirable thing. She even looks the part
as by an important something she did
not look the prima donna when she was
here before! Last night, fair, stately,
gracious and even beautiful, as she
stood there, sometimes leaning lightly
against the piano, Mme. Gadski was
just as charming to see as to hear.
I ventured to predict that in three
years the singer might be the soprano
Schumann-Heink. She is not that yet,
quite. She has moments of conscious
ness of the prima donna, a little pride
of artistry. Site has not. yet fiung her
self wholly free of herself to plunge
into the heart of the song, that is
only at the flood of her impulse. But
because she does at these moments lift
to the ninth wave of song-making, one
feels that Gadski may yet do for the
soprano repertoire what Schumann-
Heink has done for the contralto. She
has time. Comparatively, Gadski is a
young singer. She has yet ten years in
which to reach the song mother as we
found her last year.
And Gadski is admirably artistic
and entirely distinguished. Her scope
is that of the greatest singers. She is
as surely at home in the simplicities
of the lieder as in the heroics of the
music-drama. She sings Schubert as
well as she sings Wagner; "Aus
meinen grossen" as well as Mozart In
the "Nozze di Figaro." Her phrase,
nuance, "execution," are all particular
pleasures. I remember no one with a
more splendidly made crescendo. Vo
cally one feels the desire for more
power, and there is some loss of qual
ity, in the upper notes. Even an A
fiat came a little badly last night. The
lower range is remarkably round and
full, and throughout there is a delicious
mezza voce. Very breath of the voice
was that used in the most charming
rendering of the "Nussbaum," a char
acteristic little vocal thrill that once
heard is not easily forgotten. The
"Liotosblume," "Mondnacht," and
"Widmung," were the other Schumann
numbers.
The big aria from "Der Freischutz"
led off the programme, and madame
plunged right into it as If she had
been pinging half the evening. "Ich
Liebe Dich" represented Beethoven,
and Gadski admirably; the other
Franz song was "Fur Musik": there
was one Jensen lyric, "Murmelndes
Luftchen"; and four Schuberts,
crowned by the finest rendering of the
Erlkonig, splendidly dramatic, splen
didly voiced, that it has been my luck
to hear.
H. Selmar Meyrowitz accompanied,
and accompanied like the distin
guished person that he is. Mr. Mey
rowltaâthis little history explains his
kind of accompanyingâis a conduc
tor. For three years he has conduct
ed at Carlsruhe. After this tour he
goes to the Royal Opera-house at
Prague. Irl between times he has
been assisting Felix Mottl. conducting
"Parsifal" with Mr. Hertz at the Met
ropolitan Opera-house. New York. Mr.
Meyrowitz plays that way with vivid
sympathy and perfect understanding
of the singer's requirements. His
solosâhe gave us some Wagner read
out of the scores to the piano by him
self âare also that kind of playing, or
chestral, but not pianistic.
To-morrow evening there will be a
second concert given, with a group of
American songs, Strauss, Wolf and
Saint-Saens to the good.
Item: The audience throughout
was handsomely enthusiastic. You
will understand why If you go.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4. 1905.
DID NOT TELL
ALL HE KNEW
J. A. S. Low, Witness to
Dunsmuir Will, Admits He
Testified Falsely at Trial
MAY WIN BIG ESTATE
Edna Wallace Hopper's
Chances Look Brighter for
Gaining Share of Millions
"I didn't tell the whole truth," was
the astounding statement made by J.
A. S. Low when he was giving testi
mony in the Dunsmuir will case yes
terday before Crown Commissioner
Courtenay Bennett, the. British Consul.
In the face of a powerful cross-ex
amination by Sir Charles H. Tupper
and Judge E. P. Coyne, Low was com
pelled to admit that he testified falsely
when giving his testimony while the
case was being tried in Victoria.
Edna Wallace Hopper's chances of
breaking the will now loom up In a
far brighter light than before, and it
looks as if she had a good chance to
get a slice of the Dunsmuir millions.
Low was one of the witnesses to the
Alexander Dunsmuir will, whereby the
immense estate was willed away from
Mrs. Alexander Dunsmuir and given
intact to James Dunsmuir.
The will was made In California,
and, according to the laws of this
State, the witnesses must know the
nature of the document or the will is
invalid. Low in his testimony during
the trial swore that he did not know
what the document he had signed waa,
nor did he know at the time of making
that statement any of the contents of
that document.
In its decision on the merits of the
will, the lower court at Victoria
plainly stated that proof had been
furnished that Alexander Dunsmuir
had possessed mental capacity for
transacting business prior to his death
and in the opinion of the court was
capable of making a will.
The Supreme Court of British Col
umbia, however, ignored the ruling of
the lower court, when the fact that
the will had not been properly proved
under the laws of California was pre
sented to it, and it ordered that a
commission be appointed to take fur
ther evidence in this city on the ques
tion as to whether the witnesses to
the will actually knew the contents of
the document at the time they affixed
their signatures to it. The Supreme
Ct urt agreed that it would not refer
the case back to the lower court but
would await the result of the taking
of testimony here and act accordingly
in determining the legal points pre
sented to it on appeal.
The Supreme Court of British Col
umbia, however, did not sustain the
opinions of the lower court, and the
presiding Judge held that further tes
timony should be taken from Low.
Immediately after the trial Low, who
had been in the employ of the Duns
muirs for twenty-five years, was dis
charged. At the time of the signing of
the document Low stated his monthly
salary was $250, but It was increased
by James Dunsmuir to $500 a month
pending the litigation. After his dis
charge Low went to He was
summoned back by cable by Andrew
Thorne, one of the attorneys of James
Dunsmuir, in order that he might
make some changes In his former tes
timony in behalf of sustaining the
will. He did this, to the best of his j
ability, in the direct examination put
to him by defendant's attorneys yes
terday and he swore that the night he
signed the paper he heard Alexander
Dunsmuir say to James Dunsmuir,
"Hand me the will." On cross-exam
ination, however, he fell down flat, and
made a great witness for both the
plaintiff, Edna Wallace Hopper, and
Mrs. Joan Dunsmuir, the intervenor.
Under severe cross-examination
Low first said he was Ignorant of
what the will was when he signed it.
but later said he knew what the docu- j
ment was. He further swore that

How She Got the Money.
In Judge Troutt's court yesterday,
hearing was resumed in the case of
Rose M. Biggs and Addle M. Norton
against Matilde R. Cords for the re
covery of $18,200 loaned by Ann B.
Clark, the aged mother of the two
plaintiffs, now deceased. Mrs. Cords
explained how she had been able to
get so large a sum without security.
She said she was promoting the Pacific
Pine Needle Cofipany, a quasi-medical
concern, and Mrs. Clark became Inter
ested in its success. Mrs. Clark was
anxious to assist in an enterprise
which promised relief for humanity.
She loaned the money to Mrs. Cords,
said the witness, with the understand
ing that it was to be invested in the
company and not repaid until the
company was able to pay it. Mrs.
Cords said that she was not to be re
sponsible for the debt. Mrs. Norton,
one of the daughters, told a different

E. M. Bray of the firm of Bray

the Black Tartarian variety, which he
picked from a tree in his orchard at
Fruitvale. The appearance of ma
tured cherries at this time of the year
is something unusual and is due to
the abnormal weather conditions
which existed ip the fall and early
part of the winter of 1904, when cher
ry trees were in full bloom in several
growing districts. Mr. Bray said that
the trees from which the cherries
were plucked, as well as other trees,
which were blossoming, are now al

of their leaves. â¢

possible effort was made by the crew
to save him, but he disappeared under

conscious, from the sudden way in
which he disappeared. Lagert was 35

expected that upon Director Krutt
schnitt's arrival in this city the latter
part of this week, the anxiety of the
Southern Pacific Company's officials
regarding the future management of
the road will be relieved by some
announcement from the head of the
operating department of the Harriman

HORATIUS A NOSE BEFORE FRECKMAN
Close Finish in Closing Event at
the Oakland Track.
Hainault of All the Favorites, Is
the Only One to Land.
Horatius. â  which was pronounced
blind and a r.seless piece of racing
hardware at Kansas City last fall,
snapped the last race on the card at
Oakland yesterday in a nose finish
with the favorite, Freckman. Mieh
aeis, who rode Judge so poorly on Mon
day, piloted Horatius, and did 'it
.veil. "Big Bill" Knapp took care of
Freckman, and no fault could be
Cannd with his work. Horatius was
an unknown quantity, it being his
first appearance this season, and 5 and
t; to 1 could be had in the market place
about him.
Tne odds about Freckman were back
ed down to 9 to 10, while Major Mansir
and Veterans had quite a following as
Veil. Horatius had all kinds of speed,
racing out In front with the first
choice. Knapp could not shake off
the blind horse, and Horatius received
a nose verdict. Major Mansir came
with a rush at the close, and was
beater, less than a length.
The track was slow, and the rheu
matics and cripples ran to their best
notch. Hainault was the only winning
public choice.
FAVORITE RUNS THIRD.
There were eleven starters in the
opening sprint, with old Frank Pearce
ruling a slight favorite over Haven
Run, Kaiabfl and Batidor. He finished
third. Willie Harris' Haven Run start
ed off with a flashy turn of speed, but
when c hallenged in the stretch by Box
â¢Bolder with Bell up, weakened and lost
by a neck. Aibonita, a well backed
one, tired early in the game.
Had the track been made to order
it could not have suited Barrack bet
ter. The aged campaigner was as
good as 5 to 1 in the betting on the
mile and fifty yeard selling affair, for
which Rowena had a pronounced call
in the ring. During the early part of
the running, the favorite had it all her
own way. The last eighth though
caught her backing up perceptibly and
Barrack, closing very strong under the
vigorous handling of Bullman, won
easily by a neck. Glenarvon, a 25 to
1 shot, took the show from Allopath
At the weights Hainault looked a
good thing for the seven furlong run,
and the price about the gelding speed
ily fell from 13 to 10 to evens. Nicely
ridden by Travers, he registered an
easy first, after M. A. Powell and Dora
I had set the early pace. Sam Green
field came from behind with The Gad
fly, a 20 to 1 shot, downing Powell for
the place.
RED CROSS NURSE FALLS.
Travers on the favorite, Red Cross
Nurse, for the mile selling fixture met
with an accident at the first turn, which
practically ruined the mare's chances.
In some sort of a jostling match Nurse
got caught in a jam and went to her
knees. She could not â¢ recover the
ground thus lost. North West, played
down from 3Vfc to 1 to 11 to 5 and excel
lently ridden by Sam Greenfield, out
stayed Follow Me through the stretch,
earning a neck decision. Show honors
fell to Meistersinger, with Jakie Jones
tip.
If Sam Greenfield rode a clever race
on North West, his handling of Albe
marle, favorite for the selling sprint
following, did not add to his record.
He took the gelding over the overland
rc,ute. made weak play for a position
and finished among the also rana.
Cousin Carrie, with Travers in the
saddle, made all the running, and
standing a drive gamely defeated
Bronze Wing, the mount of Clem Jen
kins, a head. Helgesen was third with
Hipponax, a 12 to 1 shot. Mocorito ran
a mild race.
THICK NOTES.
Travers carried off the saddle hon
ors by piloting two winners.
Ruilmrtn is regaining his old time
form and now rides a winner or two
almost every day. As a two-year-old
pilot he is hard to equal.
Clem Jenkins is another of the old
guard who is doing excellent work
in the paddle. Clem has'been seen

FORESTS MUST
BE PROTECTED
Delegates to Convention in
the Capital of the Nation
Unanimous on the Subject
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.âMore than
.100 delegates were present to-day when
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson, presi
dent of the American Forestry Con
gress, the first of its kind held in this
country, called that body to order. The
meeting is under the auspices of the
American Forestry Association and
will be continued throughout the week.
Secretary Wilson welcomed the dele
gates ancr delivered an address, saying,
in part:
Without forestry the permanent prosperity
of the industries you represent is Impossible
because a i-ermanent supply of wood and
water can only come from the wise use of the
forest and in no way, and that supply
you must have.
I am glad to see the irrigation Interests so
strongly represented here because forestry and
irrigation go hand in hand in the agricultural
development of the West. The West must have
water, and that from a sure and permanent
supply. Unless the forests at the headwaters
of the streams used in irrigation are pro
tected, that is Impossible and Irrigation will
fall. Unless we practice forestry in the moun.
tain forests in the West the expenditure under
the national irrigation law will be fruitless
and the wise policy of thf Government in the
agricultural deveiopmefffof the arid regions
will fail.
Guy Elliott Mitchell, secretary of
the National Irrigation Association,
also addressed the congress.* He urged
th > enactment of a bill pending in
Congress, recommended by the Presi
dent, consolidating the various fores
try branches into one bureau. He also
called attention to the necessity for
the repeal of the timber and stone
act and the substitution of the bill,
which has passed the Senate, providing
for the sale of stumpage, the title to
public timber lands to remain in the
Government, thus insuring their nat
ural reforestation.
The annual report of the board of
directors of the American Forestry
Association on the progress of fores
try in the United States was read by
Edward T. Powers, secretary of the
association.
Representative Lacey of lowa, chair
man of the House Committee on Pub
lic Lands, in an address, said the ques
tion under discussion was one with
which the committee had long been
struggling. He declared that the
movement for the protection of the
forests had been late, but not too late
for the Government to take hold.
Andrew White, commissioner of
Crown Lands of Canada, made a few
remarks. In her forests Canada, he
said, had a valued asset and she was
taking care of it and not giving it
away. He predicted much good as a
result of the present congress.
W. S. Harvey, president of the board
of trustees of the Philadelphia Com
mercial Museum, urged co-operation of
all bodies represented in the congress
toward securing the repeal of the tim
ber and stone act.
â¢ Former Senator Charles Manderson,
general solicitor of the Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy Railroad, said the
future of this republic in every depart
ment of industry rests upon the preser
vation and the increase of its timber.
E. S. Gosney, president of the Arizo
na Wool Growers' Association, and
Representative Reeder of Kansas, also
made brief speeches.
STEERS WRECK GROCERY
STORE IN CINCINNATI
Frightened Animals Rush Into the
Place and Then Kick It
to Pieces.
CINCINNATI, Jan. B.âA herd of run
away steers created a panic at the City
Hall this afternoon. The cattle belonged
to George and Henry Miller of Oneonta,
Ky., and had become frightened while
being driven up Plum street. Near
Eighth street they charged a crowd of
boys, chasing them through the yard
of St. Peter's Cathedral. After clearing
the yard the steers dashed through the
court and into a grocery The place was
literally kicked to pieces by the enraged
beasts before they were chased out
and finally captured by the owners,
half a dozen policemen and several vol
unteers of the neighborhood.

BLOCKS PLANS
OF RIVAL ROAD
California Northwestern Pre
vents Laying of Track
by Santa Kosa Electric
] SANTA ROSA, Jan. 3.âConsiderable
excitement was caused here to-day by
the attempt of the electric railroad
people to lay a track across a spur
of the California Northwestern Road's
track near the brewery. The work of
cutting the steam road's rails had be
gun when a special engine to which
a string of box cars was attached
came on the scene and for some time
switched back and forth across the
point where the men had been working
effectually stopping further progress.
A crowd of citizens had collected, also
a big gang of section hands, but there
was no violence. For some time the
California Northwestern has evidently
been expecting some such move as
was made to-day. Watchmen have
been stationed at the disputed point
day and night and an engine with
steam up kept in the yards. To-night
the track for several hundred yards is
being patrolled by railroad employes
in anticipation of a repetition of the
attempt to lay the crossing.

in the suit brought by his wife, Mrs.
Eliza S. McKee, and filed early last
summer have been submitted, to Judge
John McKennedy, and his signature
granting a decree is expected within a
few days. Secrecy has been maintained
as to the charges.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3.âFavorites
had their innings at Ascot to-day, five
out of six scoring victories over their
respective fields. The remaining race
fell to a strongly played second choice.
There was a big crowd on hand and
the books had the most disastrous day
of the season. There were no striking
features to the racing except the vic
tory of Hans Wagner over a mile and
an eighth in 1:52%, which is a hew rec
ord for Ascot track.
James' strikingly handsome chestnut
gelding, Descuento, scored his third
successive victory in as many starts,
winning in easy fashion from a good
field of sprinters. Heather Honey was
the medium of a big plunge in the
fifth race and won all the way.

WHY McGINNES
WAS SURPRISED
Earthquake Jars the Bolt
to His Front Door and
the Lock Will Not Work
Customs Inspector Robert T. Mc-
Ginnes has acquired a new respect for
the baby earthquakes that of late have
been giving San Francisco a course of
the vibration treatment. With his wife
he was sitting in the Grand Opera
house Monday night when the 10:30
o'clock undulations were felt.
"Feel the New Year resolutions
breaking," remarked McGinnes, as At
las stumbled and his burden shook.
"Wonder who fell off the water wagon
that time?" This was all the attention
the revenue officer paid to the tem
blor at the time and the next minute
he-was following the fortunes of "The
Darling of the Gods."
"These earthquakes don't amount to
anything," remarked McGinnes to his
wife an hour or so later as he inserted
his latch key in the door of the Mc-
Ginnes home, 1283 Waller street.
"Scientists tell usâwhat the dickens is
the matter with this door?"
The latch key turned in the lock but
all effort to push open the door was
met with a stout resistance.
"Burglars," suggested Mrs. McGin
nes.
, With revolver in hand McGinnes re
connoitered the premises. No sound
could be heard inside and he found
nothing to indicate any unlawful in
vasion of the premises. So securely
in fact was every door and window
fastened that it was an hour before
McGinnes succeeded in breaking into
his house.
He hastened to the front door to
admit his wife. Again the door refused
to swing. He turned on the light.
"Well, I'll be "
It was all on McGinnes. The earth
quake, which he had joshed so light
ly had the last laugh. The shaking had
shot the night bolt securely barring the
door on the Inside, and long after At
las had regained his equilibrium Mc-
Ginnes was shivering on his own door
step wondering why his latch key
would not work.
TO MOVE FOR NEW TRIAL
OF DOLBEER WILL CASE
Schander's Attorneys File Notice of
Motion and Will Submit
Statement.
Notice of intention to move for a
new trial of the Bertha M. Dolbeer
will contest was filed in the Probate
Court yesterday by Hiram W. and Al
bert M. Johnson, attorneys for
Adolph Schander, the contestant,
whose case recently failed before a
jury in Judge Coffey's department.
The attorneys say that the motion will
be based upon a statement of the case
to be hereafter prepared, and six
statutory grounds for new trial are
set forth. v
Schander also filed a notice of mo
tion to tax costs in the case, and
objected to many of the items in the
proponents' bill. They say that the
charges of Commissioner R. P. Lee of
New York, who took nearly all of
the Eastern depositions, were exces
sive, and some of the depositions
should not be paid for because they
were not used. Fees for a number of
witnesses who were not called to tes
tify afe objected to, and exceptions are
taken to the charge of $76 for the
deposition of Mjss Ethel Dean, who
testified in court and whose deposition
was not used. A like objection is
made to the charge for F. A. Green
wood's deposition, as he was in town
and could have attended the trial.
Some of the witnesses, who were in
terested in the case as legatees, should
not be paid fees, it is contended.
Yellow Fever at Galveston.
GALVESTON, Tex., Jan. 3.âTwo
mild cases of yellow fever developed on
the British steamer Horatio, which ar
rived here from Para on Friday. The
disease was contracted at sea.
BIG TURF WAR
NOW BREWING
Stewards of Western Jockey
â¢Club Turn Down Corrigan
and All His Associates
DATES UNSATISFACTORY
Master of Hawthorne Says
Officials Split $18,000
When the Season Closed
CHICAGO, Jan. 3.âWar is the slogan
of Edward Gorrigan and his associates, I
who were turned down coldly by the |
stewards of the Western Jockey Club j
to-day at their monthly meeting.
True to policy of a well-developed \
and thriving turf trust, the stewards,
who recently, according to Mr. Corri- j
gan, divided something like $18,000 j
among them as their share of spoils
for the year Just ended in face of de
nunciation of both public and press,
refused point blank to reconsider the
racing dates which were recently as
signed Hot Springs Jockey Club. They
also refused to allot the new track at
New Orleans a period in which to con
duct a meeting and in answer to the
appeal of the Louisville Jockey Club |
for an extension of the spring dates
they added Jive days to the fall dates,
which was not in any way satisfactory
to the petitioners.
Dissatisfied track owners at present
in Chicago refused to-night to outline
any future policy further than to say
that some action would be taken at the
meeting to be held here to-morrow.
Nevertheless It is believed that war
will result.
RIVETER SAYS HIS WIFE
KNOCKED HIM SENSELESS
Files Cross-Complaint to Her Divorce
Suit, Claiming She At
tacked Him.
Henry Lehman, a riveter at the
Union Iron Works, whose wife Anna
recently sued him for divorce on the
ground of cruelty, yesterday filed an
answer denying her charges, and a
cross-complaint in which he accuses
her of many unwifely acts, chief of
which is her knocking him into in
sensibility with a coal box. He says,
too, that she is a spiritualist and
spends the money he gives her for
seances.
Grant Hammond, an inventor, who
is in receipt of large sums of money
and is the owner of corporation
stocks, has neglected his family, ac
cording to the complaint for divorce
filed yesterday by his wife, Laura M.
Hammond. They were married in
1899 and have two children.
Other suits for separation were be
gun by Arleen G. Wilkinson against H.
A. Wilkinson, neglect; Clara B. Flem
ing against Walter S. Fleming, deser
tion; Katie Sprague against Samuel C.
Sprague, neglect, intemperance and
cruelty. Walter M. Cushing asks the
court to annul his union with Evelyn
M. Cushing, which took place in Oc
tober, 1901. He declares that the
marriage was illegal because in May
of that year his wife obtained a
divorce from A. G. Morgan. The pre
scribed year for single blessedness had
not elapsed when she took another
mate.
Makes a Murderous Attack.
Theophilus C. Bustamente was ar
rested early yesterday morning by
Detective Matheson and booked at
thelCity Prison on a charge of as
sault to commit murder on the night
of December 16. He attacked Santos
Sobrano with a knife, cutting him
several times. The attack was the
outcome of a general fight between
Porto Rlcans and Mexicans living in
Hinckley alley about two months pre
vious.

GANS WILL BOX
JIMMY GARDNER
Alex. Greggains Turns Down
Marvin Hart and Johnson.
He Signs Lightweights
REACH TERMS QUICKLY
Rival Fighters Leave for
This City To-Day to Com
mence Work of Training
The members of the sporting frater
nity who were figuring on seeing big
Jack Johnson and Marvin Hart make
passes at each other In the ring on the
night of January 27 will be forced to
aDpease their appetites with a light
weight go instead. Last night Alex
Greggains, manager and matchmaker
of the San Francisco Club, decided to
cut loose from the heavy-weights and
match Jimmy Gardner and Joe Gans
instead.
Although the change came rather
suddenly, it will not be much of a sur
prise to those who know. As soon as
the big fellows had finished signing ar
ticles the knockers began to swing
their hammers with much force, and it
did not take them long to tell Mr.
Greggains that he had framed up a
"bum show" for his January date.
Greggains at once set to work to see
whether he could not secure two good
men in place of Johnson and Hart. Ha
had Gans and Gardner under consider
ation for a long time, and after com
municating with them both and learn
ing that they were willing to get to
gether he decided to match them.
The lightweights will meet at "Wood
ward's Pavilion on the night of Jan
uary 27 at 133 pounds at 6 o'clock. The
division of the purse will be decided
upon later. The referee question wnl
also come up when the men arrive in
this city and formally sign the articles
of agreement.
Gans will start from Baltimore to
night and on his arrival here will go
direct to Billy Shannon's villa at San
Rafael, there to train for the encoun
ter. Shannon received a telegram from
Gans last night asking him to have
the gym ready.
Gardner is in Denver and he, too,
will start for this city to-night. He
has never appeared before a San
Francisco crowd, though he was
matched to fight Gans last September.
A short time before the date of the
fight Gardner made a poor showing
against Martin Canole and for that
reason the match was declared off.
It is more than likely that the winner
of the Gans-Gardner mix-up will be pit-
ted against Jimmy Britt. Jimmy will
be about ready for another "go" next
month and either of the two men
would make a good opponent for him,
provided their bout goes through with
out any hitch or shady transaction.

NEEDS OF CITY KEEP
SUPERVISORS BUSY.
Ask Legislature to
. Give more Time
for Claims.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution memorializing the
State Legislature to amenH section 3804
of the Political Code, extending the
time from six months to three years
within which claims for protested taxes
may be filed with the board. The
amendment is designed to legalize the
return of the special levy of 15 cents
for-a hosDital and schoolhouses, which
was subsequently declared invalid by
the Superior Court.
Many of the taxpayers failed to pay
their taxes under protest and to com
mence an action within the time re
quired by law or to file their claims
within six months of the date of pay
ment, as required by section 3804 of the
Political Code. The City Attorney ad
vised the board that no refund can be
made of some $300,000 paid without pro
test for the taxes unless the statutory
time is extended for three years. This
will give taxpayers until November.
1906, to file their claims. The clerk of
the board was directed to transmit a
copy of the resolution to the Governor,
the President of the Senate and the
Speaker of the Assembly.
The Board of Supervisors also adopt
ed a resolution declaring its intention
to memorialize the State Legislature
to submit to the people an amendment
to the constitution permitting munici
palities to authorize the deposit of pub
lic funds In banks and similar financial
Institutions on condition that a reason
able interest be paid on current bal
ances and adequate security given in
the form of United States bonds, State
bonds or bonds of the municipalities
whose funds are so deposited.
OBJECT OF AMENDMENT.
The object of the proposed amend
ment is to relieve the financial strin
gency owing to large payments of
taxes, which withdraws the money
from general circulation. The same ob
ject was partially secured when the
law was amended allowing the payment
of taxes in two installments in April
and November. The form of the pro
posed amendment provides that the
legislative body of any city may adver
tise for proposals for the safe keeping
of all public moneys not immediately
needed, and such proposal shall state
â¢tfie rate of interest to be paid thereon.
Such person or corporation who offers
to pay the highest interest shall be
designated as a public depositary for
municipal funds.
The Health Board petitioned the
board to reconsider the granting of the
permit for a laundry at Twenty-sixth
and York streets, as it is the intention
of the owners to empty the drainage
into the swamp at Twenty-sixth and
Army streets. The first named board
also recommended the condemnation of
land in the vicinity so sewer connec
tions may be carried to the Army street
sewer. It also recommended the con-
demnation of tanneries and soap fac
tories that drain into the swamo. The
recommendations were referred to the
Health and Finance Committees.
YORKE MAY LOSE CONTRACT.
The demand of F. M. Yorke & Co. for
$3727 for repairing bituminous pave
ments during September was referred
to the Finance Committee. The in
spector employed by the committee re
ported that the company had not re
sumed repair work, which was a condi
tion imposed for the payment of the
bill.
Commissioner of Works Schmitz later
held a conference with the Finance
Committee and agreed to ask the Yorke
.company if it desired to go on with the
work of repairing the streets, which are
in a deplorable condition. If it refuses
to go on then the contract will be abro
gated and either new bids invited or
the Board of Works may undertake to
do the work itself. The committee
agreed to pass the September bill if the
company does work the rest of this
week.

JURYMEN ARE SELECTED
FOR THE WYMAN CASE
Trial of Bartender Accused of Ballot
Box Stuffing Will be Re
sumed To-day.
Without much bickering a jury was
selected in Judge Lawlor's court yes
terday to try the case of Charles
Wyman, accused of fraudulently vot
ing the name of S. H. Mann at the
primary election held August 9. 1904.
Following were the men selected:
Carl Heegard, 940 California street;
Albert Esdor, 1522 California street;
Peter Ulonnis, 422 Austin avenue;
Thomas Johnstone, 1757 Ellis street;
Bernard F. Warinbold, 732 Ivy ave
nue; John H. Brown, 841 Shrader
street; Allyn S. Folger. 2148 Union
street; Samuel P. Holden, 2019
I/eavenworth street; Edgar W. Hinkel,
608 Waller street; Lulgi Brichetti. 428
Devisadero street; Thomas B. Evans,
Ifo6 Vailejo street, and George H.
Buckingham, corner of Jones and
Bush streets.
The prosecution asked each tales
man if he was personally acquainted
with Wyman. Commissioner Maes
tretti, or Abe Ruef. Attorney Country
man for the defense inquired of each,
"Are you a member of the Merchants'
Association or the Citizens' Alliance?"
In challenging Rodney C. Pell, a mem
ber of the Merchants' Association,
Countryman declared that each and
every member of that organization was
prejudiced against his client. He
wanted to prove this by asking Attor
neys Hosmer and Wright, for the
prosecution, whether or not they were
being paid by the Merchants' Associa
tion. One talesman, Thomas B. Evan,
said that he was interested in the case
because some one had voted his name
at a primary election held fifteen years
ago. Nevertheless he was selected as
a juror. George H. Buckingham, a
pawnbroker, is a member of the Citi
zens' Alliance, knows Abe Ruef and all
the attorneys and witnesses on both
sides, but he was not objected to.
After the jurors were selected, 'Dis
trict Attorney Byington read the
charges that the prosecution would at
tempt to prove. Little progress was
made in the case otherwise. The peti
tions of the State Central Committee
and of the Republican County Com
mittee were read. Countryman ob
jected to either being recorded as
evidence. The court overruled the
objection to the first and will con
sider the second at 10 o'clock to-day,
when the trial will be resumed.

success because they were born poor
and because they had no Influential

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4. 1905.
Finance Committee
Probes Printers'
Bills.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday resumed its inquiry into the
charge of $400 made by A. Carlisle, for
printing an "election officers' guide"
which was ordered by. the Election
Commission, the charge being deemed
excessive by the committee.
It developed that the firm has al
ready received $1200 for the work, the
$400 representing an unpaid balance on
20,000 pamphlets at eight cents each.
Supervisor Payot figured that four
cents per pamphlet would be a fair
charge.
"It seems to me," said Payot, "that i
instead of the city paying $400 more for
the work the printer should return
$300 of the he received.
The price is exorbitant and I for one
will never vote to pay it."
"We have always had trouble In
having our printing done," said .Elec
tion Commissioner Leffingwell. I "In
fact, we know that there has been a
printing ring in existence which has
succeeded in keeping up the prices. ;
When we advertised for printing our
indexes the ring bid. B*6 cents. We re- |
Jected the bid because it was too high.
When he readvertised one of the print- ;
lng firms broke away from the com
bine and Dut in a bid-for 2.72 cents."
Carlisle explained that 20 per cent
of the charge was for royalty on pho
tographs of instructions to voters how
to mark ballots.
The committee thereupon decided to
take the matter under advisement, but
expressed itself against the city paying i
for royalties.
The Board of Works filed a formal
recommendation with the Supervisors
that upon the sale of bonds for the
improvement of accepted streets the ,
work of reconstructing the main sewer
in Mission street from Second to East
street and also the widening and pav
lng of the roadway of Mission street i
from East street to Ninth with basalt
blocks on a concrete foundation with
asphaltic grouting be ordered. Hart
land Law, on the part of Mission street
property owners, has agreed to bid for
$200,000 worth of the bonds, that being
the estimated cost of the improvement. !
on condition that the work be done by i
the city.
The amended ordinance prohibiting
the keeping of swine within the city
and county limits except in that por
tion known as Butchertown was
passed to print.
The Mayor's veto of the amended or
dinance permitting the reconstruction
of stables without the consent of prop
erty owners was referred to the Fire
Committee.
The petition of the Police Depart
ment that an ordinance be adopted al
lowing no one to conduct a detective
or police bureau without first securing
a permit from the Police Commission
was referred to the Police Committee.
Certain documents accompanied the
petition relating to the United States
Mercantile Detective Police Bureau
and to the alleged reprehensible con
duct of one of its agents.
The proposed amended ordinance to
permit the use of California oil asphal
tum in street work was referred to the
Street Committee.

Jealousy was the cause of a shoot

ing. W. R. Worthington, a teamster,
has objected to a young man named
Frank Harris of 120 Sixth street

they went into the parlor, where
Mrs. Worthington's mother joined

While they were talking Worthing

Worthington ran out of the room an<J

The Western Addition Improvement
Club met last night to consider how to
bring about the modernizing of the
railway system on Pacific avenue, Sut

meeting was the outcome of a rumor
that the United Railroads intended to

allowing it to remain a cable road.
The members of the club claim that
there are no grades on the route that
prohibit an electric system. They

WOMAN ABANDONED REBELS
AND DISTURBS THE PEACE
Teds Her Troubfes to Two Policemen
flan Whom She Raised to Wealth
Coldly Turns Her Away.
Three times within as many consecu
tive hours last Sunday night were Pa
trolmen Brown and Holmes summoned
to restore peace to 630 Sacramento
street ere they effected the restoration
by removing to prison Mrs. Albertina
Gambiah and her consort, Joseph Aebi,
owner of a saloon at 534 Kearny street.
The man had thrice ejected the woman
from his apartment, and It was her
frantic.pounding of the locked door and
his loudly uttered threats of violence if
she did not desist that routed slumber
from the lodging-house.
According to the tale told by the
woman to the policemen and by them
recounted to Judge Mogan her refusal
to passively submit to a severance of
the relationship which had existed be
tween Aebi and herself for more than
a dozen years was at the bottom of
their Quarrel. All his worldly prosper
ity was owing to her, she alleged, and
he did not care very much how she be
came possessed of money so long as she
helped him. As her personal charms
faded hs waked In pecuniary independ
ence, until he deemed It desirable to
cast her off. She managed a lodging
house on Kearny street until the evi
dences of his ingratitude and lapsed af
fection affected her mind and friends
induced her to retire from business and
seek rest. Last July she went to reside
with the family of Rudolph Jaeger, 1625
Chestnut street, "West Berkeley. Ef
forts to dispel her melancholia proved
futile, and one day she attempted to
commit suicide by throwing herself
from a window. Since then there has
been no marked improvement of Aebl's
treatment of her. In the forty-third
year of her age she is Impecunious and
feels that her life has been a mistake.
Meantime the man for love of whom
she erred is acquiring riches.
"The old story," sighed the Judge.
Then he pronounced Aebl guilty of
peace disturbance and remanded the
woman for further hearing. Her reason
is apparently upset.

Both the complaining saloonkeeper,
Mr. Ireland, tnd the arresting police
man, Mr. Walsh, averred that Her
man Kanaga's veins must be filled
with fish blood instead of the warm,
red fluid that courses through the av
erage human system.
"Of all the cold propositions that I
ever heard of or read about, much less
have seen," said Patrolman Walsh,
"this chap Is the coldest. He is an ani
mated refrigerator."
Mr. Ireland went even further than
that by suggesting that Mr. Kanaga
was a corpse and didn't know It. "For
no living being." said Mr. Ireland,
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"could be as chilly as that fellow and
continue to live."
The testimony went to show that in |
Mr. Ireland's barroom at Fulton street j
and Eighth avenue is a large coal stove j
that has been kept at a high degree of
heat ever since the atmospheric tem
perature began to need artificial stim
ulation. With the advent of the cool
snap there drifted into Mr. Ireland's
place Mr. Kanaga, who no sooner saw
the radiator of heat and felt its genial
influence than he conceived for it a
mostadhesiTeattachment Seating him- ;
self as close to it as the safety of his
tattered apparel would permit, he re- j
mained there, with teeth chattering I
and limbs ashiver, until Mr. Ireland,
whose natural kindness of heart was
enhanced by the spirit of the holiday
season, feared that his unbidden guest
was ill as well as unkempt and desti
tute and offered to send him to a hos
pital. But 'he fear was groundless.
Mr. Kanaga was simply cold. He had
been cold as long as he could remem
ber, he said, and nothing on this earth
could make him as warm as he de- ;
sired. How he would fare after he left
this earth gave him no concern. He |
was not an atheist, but systematically
endeavored to live with the reckless i
disregard of the hereafter exhibited by i
the followers of that cult.
Day after day Mr. Kanaga almost !
hugged the stove, until he became an
eyesore to Mr. Ireland and was re- j
quested to transfer his affection to
â one other medium of imparting heat,
hut when he obeyed it was only to re- j
turn at earliest opportunity and renew I
his wooing. It was as a dernier ressort
that his arrest was ordered.
Mr. Kanaga expressed inability to ex- ,
plain his chronic coldness to Judge ;
Mogan, who appeared much interested |
in the phenomenon. In reply to queries i

THE biennial message of Governor George C. Pardee was read to the Senate and Assembly yesterday. The document contains 23,000
words and is an exhaustive review of the conditions existing in the State as observed by the Governor since his inception into office
two years ago. The message contains many recommendations to the legislators, many of which, if acted upon, will result in a great
change in the conduct of State affairs. Notable among these are the Governor's recommendations concerning the schools of the State,
the prisons and the National Guard. The message also contains a complete statement of the need of California for an extensive irri
gation system and a statement of the needs of the forest reserve. v
EXECUTIVE PRAISES WORK
OF THE LAST LEGISLATURE
Solons Make Laws That Survive
Attack on Their Legality.
ACKNOWLEDGED EVILS CORRECTED
Following is the message sent by
Governor George C. Pardee to the
thirty-sixth sessibn of the California
Legislature:
Executive Department, State of Cali
fornia, Sacramento, Jan. 2, 1905.
To the Senate and Assembly;
GentlemenâThe Constitution of Cali
fornia commands that the Governor
shall communicate by message to the
Legislature at every session the condi
tion of the State, and shall recom
mend the enactment of such legislation
as he may deem expedient. Accord
ingly, I have the honor respectfully to
transmit to and to lay before your
honorable bodies my biennial message
for the years 1903 and 1904.
In common with other States of our
Union, California has. during the last
two years, enjoyed great material pros
perity. Our many industries and inter
est? have prospered. Employment has
been steady and. in most localities,
abundant. Wages have averaged as
good as ever before, crop returns have
been at least normal, and prices of
products have, on the whole, been re
munerative.
With <-Â«pc-Sal respect to California,
not only has our State been a liberal
sharer in the prosperity of the nation,
but it has enjoyed an abundant and in
dependent prosperity. Our cities and
towns have increased steadily and even
. rapidly in 'population and accumulated
wealth; our larger areas of farming
lands have, in large measure, been
subdivided into holdings of moderate
size and sold at prices which have been
within the reach of men of moderate
means. 4 To a greater extent than ever
before, at least in the northern and
central portions' of the State, new farms
have been established and green
alfalfa meadows and orchards now
greet thS eye where a few years ago
only grain fields filled the landscape.
Separated as California is from the
more thickly populated portions of our
common country by hundreds of miles
of semi-arid mountain and plain, it is
marvelous to- see how our State has
drawn to itself tens of thousands of en
thusiastic home-seekers who have come
to cast their lots with us. Although
thÂ»r means of travel have proven some
what expensive and not a little tedious>
â¢yen in these days of palace cars and
swift-rolling trains, the tide of immi
gration is still setting our way and
will continue so to flow so long as we
extend an unfailing hospitality toward
it. Our snowless winters, our intensified,
divers-Tied and yet highly specialized
agricultural pursuits are proving irre
sistible to thousands who find Eastern
summers exhausting, winters trying,
. and the production of a few staple pro
. ducts, year after year, uninviting.
Our State is no longer looked upon as
a land of unbelievable legends and un
realizable prophecies. The eyes of the
world are turned in our direction as
never before sirrce the discovery of
gold.
The future is big with promise for
California. The splendid exhibit of
products made at St. Louis has proven
conclusive as to the claims our immi
gration literature has set forth. Cali
fornia has made goo-d for all that has
been claimed, and her achievement bids
fair to rival the dreams of those who,
loving California, have prophesied in
verse and oratory of her coming great
ness. It only remains for Californians
to put aside individual and local jeal
ousies and unite in helping forward
everything that is likely to prove good
for the commonwealth to make us all
sharers in a prosperity hitherto unpar
alleled. God has been good to us; let
us be good to each other, whether of
the north or the south, city or country,
mountain or valley. Let us be all for
one and one for all.
In meeting the Legislature for a sec
ond time I wish to congratulate the
members upon the opportunity which
they possess to benefit their constitu
ents by a serious devotion to duty dur
ing the next two months. They can
benefit them by exercising economy in
making necessary appropriations and
by vigilance in preventing appropria
tions which are not necessary. They
can further serve their, constituents by
seeing to it that none but useful laws
and those carefully framed shall be
passed. Loose and careless laws fill
the courts with litigation and impose
a heavy burden upon all crasses of cit
izens.
Yet to guard against the passage of
such laws is no easy task, when during
a session of sixty days fifteen or eight
een hundred bills are Introduced which
must be read, printed, examined in
committee, reported and voted on. So
many of these bills as are unwise or
are unnecessary are stumbling blocks
in the way of the passage of measures
â¢ which are needed. It would be no small
legislative reform If some means could
be found to impose a check upon the
introduction of a multitude of bills
which will never accomplish any other
purpose than to waste the State's
money when they are printed, or to
cumber the flies when they are re
ported.
That the work of the Legislature is
so well done, when the disadvantages
under which it Is conducted are con
sidered, is remarkable, and shows how
THE M CALL
much earnest, intelligent effort is ex
pended at each session- The biennial
statute book, which embodies, in four
or five hundred pages, the net results
of the session, may contain much that
is unimportant and that which is im
portant may be marked by imperfec
tions; but it enables the public busi
ness to be carried on anG there is a
large balance of good over bad. The
numberless interests affected and the
ri'pid changes In conditions under
which business is done render unavoid
able many alterations in the statutes.
And yet it is very true that every need
less law enacted is a detriment and
the making of many minor changes at
frequent intervals is to be deprecated.
A more thorough revision at greater
intervals would be much better.
COURTS SUSTAIN'
THE ACTS OF THE
LAST LEGISLATURE
I am happy to state that the legisla
tion of the last session appears to have
been, in the main, sound in purpose
and reasonably correct. With one or
two exceptions no acts have been de
clared by the courts to be unconstitu
tional and on the other hand many
acknowledged evils were corrected.
This was done, for example, in the
amendment of the ballot law, which
previously had been so framed that
many citizens had, through ignorance
or carelessness, lost their votes. Under
the act authorizing the use of ballot
machines several counties introduced
the machines and their operation ap
pears to have been successful.
The law in relation to insanity and
the hospitals for the insane, which
theretofore had been very defective,
was revised and in its new form has
obviated most of the former difficulties.
I think I may also enumerate among
the clearly beneficial acts of the late
session the one altering the law of
divorce, requiring the entering of an
interlocutory decree and postponing for
a year the time when a divorced person
may remarry.
At the same session several acts
were passed in the interest of labor,
including one which regulated em
ployment agencies. The probation and
juvenile court laws enacted were in
tended to save from the prisons and
from lives of crime many young men
and boys who, although they have
taken first steps in .vice, are not irre
claimable. The act providing a way
to improve the common school text
books by buying the right to use
copyrighted texts promises to be pro
ductive of much good.
I especially advisJS the utmost care
in the framing of statutes to avoid
technical defects, which will defeat
their purpose. Two years ago I felt
obliged to refuse to sign a number of
bills otherwise meritorious which were
so faultily framed that it would not
have been safe to let them become
laws.
A subject closely connected with the
above fs the California codes, to which
at every session of the Legislature
many amendments are proposed. It
is now more than thirty years since
the codes were adopted, the principal
object at the time being to rescue the
law from the uncertainty of many
conflicting statutes and decisions. It
was recognized that there were ob
jections to the code system, and in
practical operation it does not realize
all that was claimed for it by its ad
vocates; but it has been a great im
provement upon what existed before
and no one proposes its abandonment.
But it is well known that the codes
have not been improved and perfected
to the extent they should be, and at
each session many general statutes are
passed embodying matter which ought
to be incorporated in the codes. The
Intetgrity of the codes should be re
spected and the system kept as sym
metrical as possible.
I desire to call the attention of the
Legislature to the improved financial
condition of the State treasury. Two
years ago It was clearly foreseen that
the general fund would run short be
fore the next succeeding collection of
taxes. In order to prevent this condi
tion becoming chronic and to make it
possible to replenish the treasury it
became necessary for the Legislature
to provide for a tax levy in excess of
that which would have been required
had the one fixed in the year 1902 not
been so far below what the actual ap
propriations called for. This excess
for the year 1903-04 amounted to 6
cents on the $100, and for 1904-05 to
nearly as much.
But before the taxes for 1903-04
were collected the expected had hap
pened, for the general fund ran short
and borrowing from other funds was
unavoidable. On June 30, 1903, the
balance in the general fund was only
$432,415 74. with five months' ex
penses to be met before taxes would
again flow into the treasury. This
small balance was soon exhausted and
it became necessary on July 31, 1903,
to borrow from other funds the sum
of $921,000, and again on November
5 to borrow the further sum of $447,
--000. This, as the State Controller
Urges Legislators to Exercise Economy and Thus Prevent
Appropriations That Are Not at All Necessary.
points out in his biennial report, was
a condition such a* had not before
arisen for nearly a decade, and it was,
as before said, to* prevent its
rence that the Legislature ordered a
larger tax levy than the appropria
tions demanded.
The effect *Â©f this levy is shown by
the vastly different condition of the
general fund on June 30, 1904, which
on that date contained $2,058,610 11,
v sum more than sufficient to meet all
prospective demands.
, The State of California, like other
solvent institutions, should maintain a
credit balance large enough to guar
antee it against having to practice un
usual and unsafe methods of financier
ing. More especially is it wise to carry
a credit balance if it can be made a
means of profit, as, in another part of
this message, I suggest can be done
by adopting the deposit plan.
IMPROVEMENTS
.MADE IN PROPERTY
OWNED BY STATE
As an appendix to this message there
lls printed a table which shows the
j amounts of money appropriated at the
j last session for buildings and other
j improvements in connection with State
j institutions; also the amounts expend
jed from such appropriations to date
! and the amounts expended from con-
I tingent funds for the same general pur
| poses. The total of appropriations
I made two years ago for betterments
| was 5800.800. and by adding to this
â  $76,362 21 of former appropriations un
expended, the State had an aggregate
of appropriations for betterments equal
to $877,162 21 to use during the bien
nium. Of this there has been actually
expended to date $685,742 61, to which
must be added the sum of $108,200 85,
which has been drawn from contingent
funds and used for betterments. This
makes an aggregate of $793,943 46 spent
for betterments in the last two calen
dar years.
As the whole amount of appropria
tions from all funds made at the last
session was $7,733,840 73, the proportion
which went for actual improvements
was about 10 per,cent. The expendi
tures made have been highly beneficial
to many of the Institutions of the
State. At the San Diego Normal School
a west wing has been added to the
main building; the Los Angeles, Chico
and San Jose normal schools have also
benefited through construction or re
pairs; the new building of the Southern
California State Hospital is well ad
vanced toward completion; the assem-

bly h*ll of the Mendocino State Hospi
tal Is partially finished and at the
Stockton, Agnews and Napa hospitals
more or less extensive improvements
have been made; for the Home for
Feeble-Minded Children $52,500 was ap
propriated and the result is much im
proved conditions at that institution,
Which is, however, still so lacking in
accommodations that many applica
tions for admission are necessarily de
nied.
Extensive improvements have been
made at the Veterans' Home, the ma
chinery in the State Printing Office has
received important additions and Cali
fornia Hall at the university for which
$250,000 was appropriated, is nearing
completion. A good deal of construc
tion work has been done at the Cali
fornia Polytechnic School in San JLuis
Obispo.
The needs of the State in the way of
new buildings are numerous, but they
can be supplied only gradually. A
certain amount of new construction
can be provided for out of each tax
levy, but many meritorious building
enterprises must await the time when
the funds can be spared.
One of the pieces of legislation of the
last session which has been followed by
good results is the act authorizing the
purchase of municipal and school dis
trict bonds for the permanent school
fund, which previous to that time could
be invested only in bonds of the United
States, the State and the counties.
These classes of securities were difficult
to procure except by paying \ high
price, more particularly since the law
as It then stood practically rendered it
necessary to buy bonds through brok
ers. The new law, by authorizing the
State Board of Examiners to bid direct
without depositing a certified check, has
enabled the making of first-hand pur
chases, while at the same time the field
of investment has been enlarged.
The effect Is noticeable in a closer in
vestment of school funds and also in a
somewhat higher average rate of inter
est on the bonds purchased. On June
30. 1903, there was 51,262,574 64 in the
State school land fund awaiting invest
ment, and a year later this had been
reduced to 5792.128 98. By further pur
chases this had been cut down to ap
proximately 5495,000 on December L
1904, and when certain investments
now in view are made practically all
available funds will be Invested and
drawing interest.
On the bonds bought between the
years 1899 and 1902 the average rate of
interest was 4.45 per cent, but the pre
miums paid reduced the net income to
the State to 3.58. For 1903-04 the aver
age rate of interest on the bonds pur
chased has been 4.107 per cent and the
net income has been 4.07 per cent,
showing how closely the new law en
ables the State to buy. The Income
from these bonds is used for the sup
port of the public schools, and the fund
now amounts in round numbers to 55,
--000,000.

â¦
WEST IS MECCA OF HOMESEEKERS
to be said that any inference drawn |
from a comparison of different classes
of institutions with respect to rela
tive cost of maintenance is likely to be
erroneous, because the objects aimed
at and the conditions under which the
institutions are conducted are so dif
ferent. The only comparisons which
properly can be made are between in
stitutions of the same class in this
State or between those of this State
and those of other States, and even
then other factors besides economy of
management enter into the result.
Usually the per capita rate of expense
of maintenance dimishes as the num
ber of inmates increase, because the
cost of administration is relatively less
in a large hospital or prison.
In general it may be said that our
public institutions are as economically
conducted as those of other leading i
States. The per capita cost of the |
four State prisons of New York is 41.2 j
cents per day, as compared with an j
average of 37.6 cents for the two Cali
fornia prisons. The State of New
York, which has 25,000 insane persons j
in its hospitals, maintains these insti
tutions at an average per capita cost
of 4 4.3 cents per day, as compared Â«
with an average cost for California L
hospitals of 42.7. The State Home for]
Feeble-minded Children in Syracuse,
K. V., reports a per capita cost of 49
cents daily, which is almost exactly
the same as that of the institution at
Eldridge.
The per capita expense of main
tei ance at Folsom prison is ordinarily
about 35 cents per day; during the
earlier part of the fiscal year 1903-04
the number of prisoners had run down
to less than 700. which raised the per
capita cost above the ordinary; since
then there has been a large increase in
the prison population. Moreover,
some of the extraordinary expendi
tures caused by the break of July 27,
1?03. have been included in figuring
out the per capita expense for last
year.
FI NDS OF STATE
SHOULD BE KEPT
IX CIRCULATION
The State of California pursues a
policy different from that of a ma
jority of the States by keeping public
funds in its own vaults, thereby lock
ing up a large amount of money, in
stead of making deposits in the banks.
By following the deposit plan the
money is permitted to circulate in the
channels of trade until needed to meet
claims against the treasury. The drain
of money at certain periods of the
year, when State, county and city gov
ernments are all collecting taxes, is
a heavy one, and it has long been a
cause of complaint in California that
ar these times business is embarrassed
by the large reduction In the circulate
ing medium.
It was a step in the right direction
when the law was passed, some years
ago, making State and county taxes
payable in two installments instead of
one, because this reduced the amount
of money locked up at any one time;
but it would be an additional benefit
to the business community if the
greater part of the funds belonging
to the State could at all times be kept
in the channels of trade. The pay
ment of taxes may be a hardship upon
property owners under the most favor
able circumstances, but it becomes a
needlessly grievous burden when It Is
made the means of locking up so much
of the money which is the life of trade.
But this is not the only way in which
the hoarding of funds is expensive to
the State, since the money represents
so much earning power lost; it could
be, and should be, made to turn into
the treasury annually quite a large
sum collected as interest. The balance
in the State Treasury, in ordinary
years, ranges from $2,500,000 to $7,000,
--000, and for the last five years has
averaged $4,000,000. The ordinary in
terest rate on daily balances paid by
the banks is two per cent, and on
$4,000,000 this would amount to $80,000
a yearâenough to sustain one of the
State institutions, or to reduce the an
nual tax rate nearly two-thirds of a
cent. If the money can be loaned
safely, and this interest earned, it
shows poor business judgment to go
on sacrificing so large a sum.
As has been said before, California
is one of the smaller number of States
which keep their money in their own
vaults. Of the forty-eight States and
Territories, according to recent statis
tics, thirty-nine pursue the policy of
depositing their funds in bank, with
such precautions for safety as they
think will insure them against loss.
The history of the State deposit sys
tem shows that it has always been
safe when proper security has been
required by law. Banks receiving
State funds should be compelled to de
posit in the treasury securitiesâpre
ferably United States. State, county
or municipal bondsâsufficient in
amount to guarantee the State against
the possibility of loss.
Several Treasurers of this State have
pointed out the unwisdom of the
hoarding policy. Hon. W. g. Greene,
in his report for 1899, said:
Pages 13 to 18
I feel that I would not be doing- my whole
duty If I did not call attention to the fact
that California Is still following- the method
of collecting money semi-annually from thÂ«
pecple and storing it up like old junk, whea
the object, and only object, of money is cir
culation. â¢ â¢ â¢ L'pon thorough consideration
and investigation I am of the opinion that a.
system of State and county depositories ought
to be established.
Honorable J. R. McDonald, who was
Treasurer from 1891 to 1895, said in one
of his reports:
I have never been able to see the necessity
or propriety of the State having- two or three
million dollars piled up in her vaults year
after year, without any benefit to the State
and positive detriment to the people.
The present Treasurer, Honorable
Truman Reeves, entertains the same
views, and, referring; to the deposit
plan, he writes:
I am in favor of the idea, provided a law
is framed whereby the funds can be safe
guarded so as to eliminate the absolute pos
sibility of lots to the State and if possible to
keep the office of State Treasurer out of
politics.
In view of these opinions, and bear
ing in mind that such great States as
New York, Pennsylvania and Massa
chusetts have pursued the deposit plan
for many years, receiving large sums
foe interest, and losing nothing even
wrrÂ«*:WiMPi*&v* failed, it appears
that we ought, as soon as it can oh
done, to substitute for our present
practice one more consonant with busi
ness thrift and judgment. If this can
be done by statute merely, it is a sim
ple matter; if a constitutional amend
ment shall be held to be necessary, the
object to be attained is worth the
trouble it will cost.
TAXATION SYSTEM
WAS IN NEED OF
RADICAL CHANGE
In my inaugural address, two years
ago, I expressed the belief that the
time was near at hand when the peo
ple of California should consider the
question whether they ought not to
introduce radical changes in their rev
enue and taxation laws, especially in
relation to the raising of revenue for
State purposes. The main reasons for
this belief were the escape from taxa
tion of large amounts of personal prop
erty and the difficulties which will al
ways exist in securing under the pres
ent arrangement a fair assessment
and a just equalization between the
counties. The further opinion was ex
pressed that the object aimed at
ought to be the eventual separation
of State and county taxation, giving
to each of these political divisions its
own subjects of taxation and its own
assessment machinery.
During the past two years nothing
has occurred to change the belief then
expressed; but much has occurred to
confirm it. There Aaa been consider
able popular discussion of the pro
posal that a new State revenue system
is needed, and the tone of this discus
sion has been uniformly favorable. At
the same time the movement in other
States, to which also I referred In my
former message, has continued to be
away from the employment of the ad
valorem, or general property, tax as
the basis of all State revenue collec
tions, and toward the development of
different systems In different States,
according to their several opportuni
ties and needs.
This revenue question is no new one
in California, nor is this the first time
that the demand for an improved sys
tem has been heard. A short review or
the history of State taxation will be
interesting, and may help us to a bet
ter knowledge of our needs.
In the very earliest days of our Statw
its revenues were derived largely from
merchandise and other licenses, but the
general property tax was soon put In
operation and for a rood many years
gave general satisfaction. Personal
property for a time constituted nearly
one-half of all the property assessed,
and therefore it was not complained
that this form of wealth was escaping
its due share of taxation. The Legisla
ture assumed the right to exempt from
taxation certain kinds of property,
such as churches, hospitals, the prop
erty of widows and orphans, growing
crops and mining claims; but when
danger arose from the extent of the ex
emptions the Supreme Court came for
ward and declared them all to be un
nnniÂ»+itiiti/-inil
But in time a serious evil arose from
the inequalities of taxation as between
the various counties, which there was
no means of controlling. In the poorer
counties the assessments were kept
high, because only so could enough
taxes be raised to pay the expenses of
county government, and as the same
assessments were the basis for State
taxation those counties contributed
more than their just share to the State
treasury, while the wealthier counties
were able to keep their assessments
low and to escape their due proportion
of general taxation. It was asserted
that In some counties the assessed
values were 80 per cent of the true
values and In other counties no more
than 20 to 30 per cent. As Governor Pa
checo told the Legislature, "While the

fundamental law demanded a revenue
system of rigorous exactitude and uni
form justice, they had developed one of
false values and gross inequalities."
To remedy this evil the Legislature,
by statute, in 1870 created a State
Board of Equalization for the purpose
of equalizing assessments as between |
the counties. But it was not until the
â¢Political Code in 1872 established the
State Board on a supposedly firm foun
dation that it was able to show what
it could do, and then the results were
almost startling, for in one year the ,
total assessment of property rose from i
$269,000,000 to or more than
125 per cent. But the Supreme Court
took the view that the Board of Equali
zation could not constitutionally exer
cise the powers it claimed, and at once :
the assessment roll began to fall off. |
But before this there had begun tojs- i
sue from the Supreme Court a series of I
decisions based upon the uniformity j
and equality clause of the old constl
tutlon, which held that the taxation of I
bonds, notes, credits and other evl- j
dences of debt, when the property on
Which they rested or by which they
were secured was also taxed, was
double taxation, and this created dis
satisfaction, because it was claimed
the wealthy were escaping taxation.
Finally, in 1873, the court in a sweeping
â¢decision held the mortgage tax to be
unconstitutional.
Tlfat decision was in effect the
cause of the calling of a convention
to frame a new constitution; since, al
though the convention was not held
until 1878-79, the dissatisfaction had
"been growing steadily from the date
of the mortgage tax decision. The ad- t
vacates of a new plan of taxation were
able to point to the fact that, although
the State was growing wealthier, the
assessment of personal property had
ceased to increase and was diminish
ing, both relatively and absolutely.
From $220,000,000 in 1572 it had de
clined to 5115.000.000 in 1878, and
from constituting 40 per cent of the
total assessment, as it did in 1869, it
had, in 1878. become only 20 per cent.
This was one of the evidences that a
great deal of property was escaping
taxation.
REVENUE QUESTION
RESPONSIBLE FOR
NEW CONSTITUTION
As the revenue question was the one
.which was principally responsible for
the calling of the constitutional con
vention, so it was the one which in
that body was discussed longest ana
with greatest energy. The utmost de
termination was shown to adopt a
plan of taxation which should reach
all species of property and make every
class of people bear its proper share of
the burden of taxation. The State
Board of Equalization was made con
stitutional and the mortgage tax prob
. lem was solved by treating the mort
â¢ gage as an interest in the property
and allowing a proportionate deduc
tion from the assessment on the latter.
In the old constitution the subject
of revenue and taxation had been dis
posed of in one section of five lines,
but in the new constitution a whole
article, embracing thirteen sections,
was devoted to it.
' The gist of the old constitution with
reference to taxation was contained in
these two sections, said to have been
taken from the first constitution of
Texas: "Taxation shall be equal and
uniform throughout the State. All
property in this State shall be taxed
in proportion to its value, to be ascer
tained as directed by law."
Some of the warmest debates of the
convention of 1879 took place over
the question whether the "equal and
uniform" provision should go into the
r.ew constitution, upon which some of
the ablest members insisted. But it
was upon that provision that the un
popular decisions of the Supreme
Court had rested and a majority of the
delegates voted to exclude the words
from the new instrument.
The provision that all property shall
be taxed in proportion to Its value was
retained, but with it was included a
definition of "property" which was
meant to be so thorough going that
nothing should thereafter escape from
the tax-gatherer. It? was declared that,
for purposes of taxation, property
should "include moneys, credits, bonds,
stocks, dues, franchises and all other
matters and things, real, personal and
mixed, capable of private ownership,"
the only exceptions being growing
crops and public property.
It was further provided that all
property should be assessed in the
political subdivision where situated,
save and except railroads operated in
more than one county, which were to
be assessed for both State and county
purposes by the State Board of Equali
zation. It had already been recognized
by the lawmakers of Illinois and Mis
souri that a great railroad could not
be properly assessed piecemeal, and
their plan of assessment of such prop
erty by a State board was followed by
constitution makers.
It was the expectation of the fram
ers of the new constitution, as we have
seen, that a great deal of property
would be taxed which theretofore had
escaped. One of the leaders re
marked:
We have said that all property should be
taxed In proportion to its value. In addition
tj that we say that property which has here
tofore been held not to be property shall, for
purposes of taxation, be deemed/ property and
subject to taxation. That covers the ground.
This boast was not justified by re
sults, and the effect of the new con
stitution In the direction of increasing
assessments was, after the first year,
very disappointing. In 1879, the last
year of the old constitution, the as
sessment roll amounted to $549,000,000,
and in 1880. the first year of the new,
it rose to $666,000,000, and the proportion
of personal property increased from
20 per cent of the whole to 26 per cent.
But the next two years the aggregate
of the roll declined, and the propor
tion which the personal propertyâthe
kind of property which It was the
special aim of the makers of the new
constitution to reachâPears to the
whole commenced to diminish from
that time forth. From 26.18 per cent it
went down as low as 13.56 per cent,
and is now practically stationary at
15 per cent. So that, despite
conian rigor of the definition given to
property in the first section of the
article on taxation in our present con
stitution, the tax gatherers find not
more of personal property than before,
but even relatively less, and absolute
ly less most of the time. For the aggre
gate of personal property assessed nev-
er afterward went as high as It was
in 1874âwhen it was $210,000,000âuntil
1903, when it was $269,000,000. In 1904
it was $239,000,000.
POWERS OF BOARD
OF EQUALIZATION
LIMITED BY COURT
In the equalization of assessments as
between counties, also, the new con
stitution did not prove to be a perfect
success. The Supreme Court stripped
the Board of Equalization of some of
the Dowers which it had been supposed
that it possessed and which it at
tempted to exercise. It can raise or
lower county rolls only as a whole
and can not distinguish between dif
ferent classes of property, although
one may have been assessed too high
and another too low. Yet the total as
sessed value of property in the State
has continued to increase slowly with
the growth in population and wealth,
but real estate and improvements bear
85 per cent of the burden. The total
assessed value of money and solvent
credits is only $42,000,000, which repre
sents, of course, but a small portion
of the true amount of this kind of
property In the State.
Since 1880 the constitution has been
often amended, but most of the amend
ments of the article upon taxation have
been in the direction of exemption.
Fruit trees and grapevines of a cer
tain age, household goods of the val
ue of a hundred dollars, church buila
ings, the property of several educa
tional and scientific institutions, and
State and municipal bonds have been
relieved of tax burdens. But while all
of these amendments taking property
off the assessment roll have been
adopted, there have been no amend
ments to put any on, nor has any
change been introduced in the consti
tution which would make the system
more elastic or give the Legislature
greater power over the subject mat
ter. This is the most serious fault of
the constitution in so far as it relates
to taxation; the system was finished
when the constitution was adopted;
it has not been capable of growth. In
other States the Legislatures improve
the plan of taxation from time to time
as experience suggests changes; their
revenue laws as they stand have been
a gradual evolution. But in California
no changes of importance can be made
because of conflict with the constitu
tional scheme.
In the convention which framed this
constitution there were a minority of
men who foresaw that a scheme or
taxation so rigid as this would not be
permanently satisfactory, and they
argued in favor of vesting consid-.
erable discretion in the Legislature.
One of those who took this view was
the eminent lawyer, Samuel M. Wil
son, one of the master minds of the
convention, although in this instance
his counsel was not followed. Mr.
Wilson, on one occasion, said:
Government is a complex piece of machinery
and runs only at great expense. The true
question then is this: What is the best sys
tem of taxation for the support of the govern
ment? In every State in the Union, with the
exception of the instances mentioned by the
gentlemen here, the matter of taxation is left
to legislative discretion, with only certain
broad principles on the subject laid down in
the constitution. In some few States the con
stitution fixes the objects and subjects of taxa
tion and makes it mandatory upon the Legis
lature. In most cases it is left to the Legis
lature to select the objects and subjects on
which taxes should be levied consistent with
the general principles of equality and uni.
formltyâthe tax being upon property and not
upon persons. The Legislature should have
this discretionary power. My individual opin
ion is that the constitution should only pre
scribe that all real estate and all tangible
property shall be taxed and that such taxa
tion shall be according to value and that the
Legislature should have, beyond that, the
power and discretion of imposing any other
tax that it might see fit. except a capitation
tax. Then the Legislature, in its discretion,
could enact a stamp tax, a tax upon Incomes,
or a tax upon anything else, according to the
necessities of the State at the time. That
would be Justice to all and would leave it
mere elasticâln a better condition and more
in accordance with the general principles pre
vailing in all of the States of the Union.
And Mr. Wilson added another valu
able suggestion when he said:
It Is not necessary to equal and uniform
taxation that It should be universal.
It is worthy of note that the States
in which the revenue laws are to-day
In the most satisfactory shape are
those in which there have been the
fewest constitutional restrictions upon
the power of the Legislature, nor does
there appear to be any serious com
plaint that this power has been used
to discriminate unfairly against any
class of taxpayers. Experience and
reason alike justify the belief that
legislative control over the method of
levying taxes would no more be taken
advantage of to oppress or to destroy
than are the large powers in other
directions which the Legislature pos
sesses. No Legislature could afford, as
a matter of mere political expediency,
to do injustice to such a large class
of persons, or important business In
terests, as it would do by adopting an
unjust tax law. It is a striking fact
that it is in the States such as New
York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Ohio, in which the business interests
are strongest, that the most advanced
methods of taxing corporations have
been adopted and after business has
had a little time to adjust itself to these
new forms of taxation, they excite no
great opposition.
EASTERN STATES
ARE SUPPORTED BY
INDIRECT TAXES
The States which have effected a
complete, or almost complete, separa
tion of their State and local revenue
systems are New York, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Connecticut ana f>elaware.
These five States are able to dispense
with a general property tax for State
purposes because they have obtained
in other ways sufficient revenue to
meet their needs. This they have not
accomplished at a single stroke, but
usually by successive additions to their
laws. It was about twenty years ago
that the first step was taken in New
York, although the greater number of
the new features have been added re
cently. Pennsylvania, which has not
taxed real estate and improvements for
State purposes for many years, has
been still longer in developing her plan
of taxation. New York's constitution
contains nothing requiring that taxa
tion shall be uniform, or equal, or in
proportion to the value 6f the property
assessed, while the Pennsylvania con
stitution content 3 itself with saying
that taxation shall be uniform upop the
same classes of subjects and shall be
levied by general laws.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4. 1905.
STATE FUNDS IN VAULTS
'"THE State of California pursues a policy different from that of a ma
* jority of the States by keeping public funds in its own vaults, thereby
locking up a large amount of money, instead of making deposits in the
banks. By following the deposit plan the money is permitted to circu
late in the channels of trade until needed to meet claims against the
treasury. The drain of money at certain periods of the year, when State,
county and city governments are all collecting taxes, is a heavy one, and
it has long been a cause of complaint in California that at these times
business is embarrassed by the large reduction in the circulating medium.
Depository System for the Cash of the Common
wealth Should Be Established, Says Governor.
These States, however, are only a
few of those which have made notable
progress in the same direction. Ohio
has recently adopted a corporation tax
law which has made it possible to re
duce the rate of the general property
tax one half. Minnesota has reduced
the same tax to 10 cents on $100. Wis
consin has come so near to eliminating
the ad valorem tax that only a small
part of her revenue is raised by It and
the rate is 15 cents on the $100. Massa
chusetts raises half, or more than half,
of her revenue by indirect taxes. Maine
is working along similar lines. Mary
land raises only a third of her revenue
by ad valorem taxes and West Virginia
but one fourth. The old State of Vir
ginia has recently adopted a new rev
enue law which embodies a number of
modern ide.as. Tennessee secures from
other sources than the general property
tax considerably more than half of her
revenue and Missouri has made such
progress that her last State tax rate
was only 15 cents on $100. Michigan
is making progress In the same general
direction. One of the latest States to
remodel its revenue laws with gratify
ing results is Colorado.
Since comparatively little can be
done under the present constitution to
change the revenue laws, or to provide
new sources of revenue, it follows that
it is not necessary to decide at this
time precisely what laws ought to be
enacted. In a few waysâone of which I
will mention a little later âsome addi
tional revenue may be provided. But
any new system must wait upon con
stitutional changes.
The essential thing, then, will be to
propose the necessary constitutional
amendments, the object of which shall
be to give the Legislature some discre
tion to deal with the subject of State
taxation. It should have authority to
continue the general property tax for
so long a time as may be needed to
work up adequate revenues from other
sources, and it should also have
authority to discontinue this form of
tax for State purposes when it is no
longer necessary, und to "separate State
from local taxation. It should also be
in the power of the Legislature to
adopt such of the several alternative
methods of taxing corporations as may
seem most expedient. An essential
part of the Legislature's authority
should be. to exempt from local taxa
tion certain classes of subjects which
may be specially relied upon to pro
duce State revenue. But as the power
of the Legislature over the whole
matter of taxation is absolute, except
as limited by constitutional restric
tions, all of these objects could be easily
accomplished by a few constitutional
changes. The first and the tenth sec
tions of Article XIII are those which
need to be especially considered.
One of the forms of taxation, other
than the general property tax, of whose
legality under the present constitution
no fear need be felt, and with respect to
which the present Legislature can
legislate, is the inheritance tax, or as
it is {sometimes called, the tax on trans
fers. I recommend to the Legislature
that it give careful consideration to the
question whether the application of the
present law should not be extended,
first, by taxing direct as well as col
lateral inheritances, and secondly, by
making the tax progressive, as has
been done in Illinois, Ohio, Missouri,
Wisconsin and many other States.
INHERITANCE TAX
PROVES A SOURCE
OF GREAT REVENUE
The importance of this particular
branch of the subject of taxation is
such that it will justify consideration
somewhat in detail. Since 1893, the
year in" which the California law was
passed, the system of inheritance taxes
has obtained great development in the
United States and other countries, and
the revenues derived from this source
promise to be very important. In
Great Britain, where the tax is levied
for the benefit of the imperial Govern
ment, 19 per cent of all the revenues,
according to the latest available sta
tistics, are the product of this form
of taxation, and in the State of New
York the income approaches five mil
lions of dollars per year.
As a leading American writer on
economics. Professor E. R. A. Seligman
of Columbia University, remarks: "The
inheritance tax to-day scarcely needs
defense; it is found in almost every
country, and the more democratic the
country, the more developed the tax."
Doubtless there are still theorists who
regard such a tax as an attack upon
the established rights of property; but
when in a country where property
rights are so firmly established as in
England the Government claims the
privilege of taking from estates of the
largest size so much as 8 per cent;
when in the republic of France the tax
goes, in some instances, so high as 15
per cent; when in such old common
wealths as Pennsylvania, New York
and Massachusetts the system Is in
full operation; and when, finally thirty
States in all have adopted this tax, it
can no Jonger be regarded as revolu
tionary; except in the sense that all
progress is revolutionary.
The gradual extension of this tax is
an illustration of the principle I have
already mentioned, that the best sys
tems of taxation are an evolution.
Originally the Inheritance tax applied
only to collateral inheritances of per
sonal property; then it was extended
to real property; later New York en
acted a direct inheritance tax law, and
eventually the conservative State of
Illinois made the tax progressive, i. c.,
increasing the rate in proportion to the
amount of the estate. By the year
1900 ten States had imposed direct as
well as collateral inheritance taxes, and
during the next three years eleven
other States had taken the same action.
In each of the two other common
wealths on the Pacific Coast, Oregon
and Washington, both direct and pro
gressive taxation of estates has been
enacted.
California's present law brings into
the treasury a revenue ranging from
1250,000 to $300,000 a year, which is
doubtless considerably less than it
would be If all the taxes due were col
lected. By the addition of a direct tax
the revenues could be greatly in
creased and the collection of the tax
made more certain. An excessive rate
of tax should not be Imposed on either
direct inheritances or collateral in
heritances, and the rate on the former
is usually made less than on the latter.
Also, there should be an exemption up
to a liberal amount on Inheritances go
ing to widows or lineal descendants.
I think it is safe to say that there is
no State in the Union that .offers to
its children any better educational ad
vantages than does our State of Cali
fornia. Gauged by the monetary stan
dard, California does much more for
education than the average of her sis
ter States. For, while all the States,
including ours, pay, on the average,
16 per cent of the cost of their public
school system, California, to her credit
be it said, pays about 45 per cent of
the cost of hers.
We had. in this State, m the last
school year, 407,398 children who ought
to have been at school, as provided by
law. In the public schools, however,
there were but 298,520 enrolled. Of the
remainder, it is estimated that 37,226
attended the various private schools,
leaving 71,652 California children who,
for one reason or another, did not at
tend school at all. While this number
is, by comparison with other States,
by no means excessive, it is too large
for California. And there ought to be
some means devised to reduce it great
ly. For it is to be the decided interest
of the State to see to it that its chil
dren shall all receive, so nearly as may
be possible, at least a common school
education.
NEARLY ONE-HALF
OF STATE'S INCOME
GOES TO SCHOOLS
Looking toward this end, California
has been very liberal toward educa
tion. Last year she spent from the
State fund $2,715,70i> on the primary
and grammar schools. To the high
schools she contributed $232,386. To
the Aye normal schools she gave $289,
--798. The institution for the deaf, dumb
and blind received $68,628 of State
money. And to the university was
given $621,363. Even the Farmers' In
stitutes received $3000 to educate their
members. So that it will be seen that,
first and last, the State paid out of its
treasury, last year, the very respect
able sum of $4,930,781 for education.
And when it is remembered that the
average yrarly income of the State
from all sources is about $10,000,000, it
will be seen that nearly one-half there
of was spent last year for education.
The law provides that there shall
be raised by taxation $7 for every
child of school age. Last year this re
quired a tax levy of 17.8 cents per $100
of assessed valuation throughout the
State. On account of this law the
State tax must be increased by $120,
--799 this year over what it was last
year, because there were 17,257 more
children of school age last year than
there were the year before. This will
compel an increase of about one cent
in the tax levy automatically fixed by
law, providing the assessed valuation
of State property shows no great in
crease. The university also receives,
under the law, 2 cents on every $100
of assessed valuation; and the high
schools receive cents on the $100;
making in all 22.3 cents on the $100 re
quired for education out of a total
State tax rate averaging something
over 50 cents on the $100.
It requires nearly 8000 teachers to
carry orf the primary and grammar
schools of the State. And it is only with
great difficulty that Boards of Educa
tion and School Trustees are able to
find enough teachers to supply Jhelr
wants. There appear to be at least two
reasons for this dearth of available
teachers. In the first place, we require
more preparation from teachers than
we did a few years ago. This is a good
thing, because, like doctors and law
yers, our sthool teachers should be well
educated i#F their profession. The other
reason for the dearth of teachers is
that the pay offered them is not suffi
cient to induce very many persons to
devote their lives to teaching. We can
not expect that men and women will
spend years of time and large sums of
money to prepare themselves for a pro
fession In which it is possible for them
to receive only meager salaries without
the possibility of increased pay, as ex
perience and devotion in other walks of
life provide. Therefore our young men
especially do not become teachers, and
our young women in too many in
stances look upon teaching as an expe
dient which will enable them to live
until something more alluring calls
them from the schoolroom.
Jn line with this there is a wide
spread'discussion among the teachers
and those who are non-professionally
interes)ed in education looking toward
an increase in teachers' salaries. To do
this it is proposed by some to raise
the State school census per capita from
$7 to $9. As there were last year, as be
fore stated, 407,398 census children in
the State, this raise of $2 per child
would call for an increase in the State
taxes of $814,796 per annum for the
next two years (involving an increase
of about 5 cents in the annual tax levy)
âa sum altogether too great to raise
by State taxation under present condi
tions, and the demand for which would
not be so pressing if the State school
fund were distributed in such a man
ner as to do the greatest possible good.
This brings me to another matter
conected with the salaries of our
school teachers to which, during the
past year, I have given considerable
attention. And that is the manner in
which, under our present law, the State
money is distributed to the teachers.
I find, for instance, that last year the
teachers of Alpine County each re
ceived $249 of the State's money, and
that the teachers of San Francisco each
received $783 from the State treasury;
while, between these two limits, the
State's money was distributed in
varying amounts to the teachers in
the various countiesâthose of no two
counties receiving the same amounts.
As a result of this, I found also that.
In addition to the State school fund
tax, which all counties pay alike, the
counties were compelled to tax them
selves at rates varying from 6 2-5 cents
to 50 cents on the $100 to sustain the
county end of the school burden. And
it appears, too, that in several in
stances the poorest counties are com
pelled to tax themselves the heaviest
to raise county school funds. Mono
County, for instance, is compelled to
put on a county school tax of 50 cents
per $100, the limit allowed by law, to
raise, In addition to what the State
gives her, enough money to carry on
her public schools. San Francisco,
however, on the other hand, had to im
pose only a 6 2-5 cent county tax rate
to add to the money she received from
the State.
MANNER IN WHICH
THE SCHOOL FUNDS
ARE DISTRIBUTED
So we have these rather anomalous
conditions: (1) the poorer and more
sparsely settled counties of the State,
as a rule, get less of the State's money
per teacher than do the rich and thick
ly settled counties, the amount vary
ing between $249 in Alpine County and
$783 In San Francisco; (2) we find that
the poor and sparsely settled counties
have to pay, in common with all the
other counties, a fixed tax into the
State treasuryâlast year this tax was
17 4-5 cents per $100 assessed valuation.
In addition to that the poor counties
have to raise, relatively, very large
county funds to eke out the school
money they receive from the State.
Mono County, for instance, paid 67 4-5
cents last year to support the schools,
while San Francisco paid but 241-5
cents, and the school expenses of the
different counties varied between these
two .extremes.
There are many other and equally
curious inequalities in the manner in
which, under our present law, the State
money is distributed to the counties.
But the preceding are fair samples of
the others and I will not give any more
of them.
These inequalities are the result of
the manner in which the law provides
the State money shall be distributed
to the counties. Therefore, I think the
law ought to be changed so .that the
State's money shall be distributed more
equitably. It does not appear to me
to be exactly fair that Alameda County,
for instance, should receive $579 per
teacher of the State's money, while Al
pine should receive from the same
source but $249 per teacher; El Dorado,
$268; Inyo, $275; Lake, $311; Lassen.
$299; San Diego, $293; Plumas, $288, and
Mariposa, $310.
It seems to me, therefore, and I so
recommend to the Legislature, that
there ought to be a complete revision
of the method whereby the State's
school money is distributed to the
counties, to the end that a more
equitable division thereof may be
made.
In spite of the fact (more probably
by reason of it) that the requirements
for admission to and graduation from
the normal schools have been raised
during the past two years, the num
ber of graduates therefrom has not
decreased. On the other hand, how
ever, the teachers graduated from the
normal schools have improved in effi
ciency and capabilityâboth of which
qualities are greatly to be desired. And
it is to be hoped that, before many
years, the normal schools will be, like
the various schools of medicine, law
and theology, strictly professional
schocls In which only the theory and
practice, and subjects closely allied
thereto, of the profession of teaching
shall be taught, leaving matters of gen
eral culture to the public schools, the
high schools and the universities.
In free higher, or university, educa
tion California is not second to any
State in the Union. With 2400 under
graduates at Berkeley and with schools
of medicine, art, law, dentistry, veteri
nary medicine, the great Lick Observa
tory and the Wilmerding School of
Mechanical Arts so closely affiliated
with it as to be practically, If not
quite, parts of it, our State University
takes rank among the greatest uni
versities of the United States.
FREE EDUCATION
SOURCE OF GREAT
BENEFIT TO STATE
Leland Standford Junior University
Is, next to our State University, also
the object of our State educational
pride. And, taken together, these two
great institutions of learning place
California in the front rank of States
which foster the higher education.
The University of California gives to
every aspiring, ambitious, determined
young man or young woman, rich and
poor alike, the opportunity to acquire
an education which will benefit not only
him or her, but also the State. And
I think it may be safely stated that
the State derives its greatest benefit
and return from the money it invests
in the university from those students
whose pecuniary means would not
allow them to graduate from it were
it not a free institution. In fact, I
have In mind a classmate of mine,
who worked his way through the uni
versity, and, by means of the free
education he there received, was en
abled to perfect certain mining pro
cesses which, in themselves, have saved
to the State of California many times
the whole cost of the university.
It is to be hoped that the people of
the State will continue to have that
love for the university of which they
are now possessed. And it is also to
be hoped that the university will, in
its turn, not forget that it owes every
thing to the State, and that it will
continue to earn and deserve the good
will of the people so who cheerfully
support it.
Public sentiment in California favors

the resources of our great State. We
should not be afraid to make Invest
ments on which the returns may be
delayed beyond the immediate present.
It is our duty to be State builders,
not only that we may enjoy the bene
fits of a wise foresight, but that our
children's children may be sharers in
such rewards.
California is full of undeveloped re
sources and our continued prosperity
is dependent upon their continued de
velopment. Unfortunately, there are
certain of our resources which are
menaced with waste if not with de
struction, and an intelligent self-inter
est demands that we pursue such a
course of action as will conserve them.
The Federal Government has entered
upon a liberal policy in regard to the
development of the West by the recla
mation of arid lands, and California
can well afford to meet these advances
half way by co-operating with the
National Government in measures de-
signed for the benefit of our people.
In this belief the last Legislature
passed an act appropriating $60,000
to be expended in conjunction with at
least an equal sum appropriated by
Congress for the purpose of making
InvestigaUons into our water and for
est resources. We were offered the
services of the experts employed by
the United States Geological Survey
and Department of Agriculture in
making these inquiries, with a pros
pect that the data secured might ulti
mately result in the expenditure In
California of some of the millions
which the enactment of the arid land
law made available for reclamation
work. After less than two years of
preliminary and collaborative work it
already appears that this expectation
is to be abundantly fulfilled.
The topographic branch of the
United States Geological Survey has
been engaged in mapping the Sacra
mento Valley and other Important
areas. This Is considered to be the
first prerequisite to a solution of irri
gation and flood reclamation problems.
The hydrographic branch of the
Geological Survey has been conducting
two special lines of related work âex-
plorations and surveys of reservoir
sites and the gauging of the flow of
streams. The first is a prerequisite
for the conservation of waters, the
second for determining the quantity of
water to be conserved.
The United States Bureau of- For
estry has carried on investigations
covering 21,000,000 acres of forest
lands in California. The data ob
tained will be used In preparing forest
maps, In determining what areas
should be reserved by the National
Government as a protection to the flow
of streams and in framing such a re
port as may form the basis for a State
forest policy.
The fourth line of Investigation car
ried on in collaboration with the
United States Government Is that of
water distribution for agricultural pur
poses and it is being conducted by the
Department of Agriculture.
STATE IS IN NEED
OF JUST CODE OF
IRRIGATION LAWS
California has suffered much for
want of a well ordered and definitely
settled policy for the use of water for
irrigation. At the last session of the
Legislature efforts were made to se
cure an improved code of irrigation
laws, but the draft of such a code sub
mitted proved unsatisfactory to the
Legislature and one of the reasons
why it was opposed was that the data
on which it was based was inadequate.
When the Department of Agriculture
shall have completed the investigations
in hand it cannot be doubted that
seme Legislature in the near future
will be In possession of the knowledge
necessary for formulating a wise,
beneficent and just code of irrigation
laws. Pending the completion of this
investigation it may be well for the
Legislature to refrain from attempt
ing irrigation legislation of a radical
character.
At the recent meeting of the Na
tional Irrigation Congress In the city
of El Paso there was adopted a reso
lution favoring co-operation between
the reclamation service of the Fed
eral Government and State and local
authorities in the planning and execu
tion of irrigation works which are un
dertaken by districts organized under
general laws, and the proposal seems a
practical one.
There is reason to hope that, with
the powerful aid of the Federal Gov
ernment, reservoirs for the impound
ing of flood and irrigation waters will
be constructed on a scale of magnitude
that will insure the reclamation of
great areas otherwise doomed to par
tial if not total aridity. "It is be
lieved," declares one of the Govern
ment experts employed in this work,
"that the Sacramento Valley is one of
the greatest, if not the greatest, latent
opportunities for irrigation develop
ment in arid America."
Much success has attended the ef
fort to find reservoir sites in North
ern California, and such as have been
found on Government land have been
withdrawn from entry. The greatest
of these projects is one to utilize Big
Valley on Pit River, which, if dammed
to a height of 110 feet, would afford
the enormous impounding capacity of
3,200,000 acre-feet, or sufficient to
cover that number of acres with water
to the depth of one foot. The total
aggregate capacity of all the reservoir
sites so far surveyed in Northern Cali
fornia is 4,800,000 acre-feet,
At the extreme southeastern and ex
treme northeastern ends of our State
two reclamation enterprises of great
extent are proposed. One of these Is
for the Irrigation of more than 300,000
acres of land situated near the Colo
rado River and for this an allotment
of $3,000,000 has been obtained from
the national reclamation fund.
The other undertaking, one to which
legislative attention will doubtless be
invited, is likely to prove still more re
markable and important. The Klam
ath Basin, situated partly In Califor
nia and partly in Oregon, contains sev
eral lakes and both overflowed and
arid districts. A way has been found
so to increase the flow of the Klamath
River as to drain two important
lakes and reclaim to cultivation the
greater part of their areas. To do this
the consent of both California and
Oregon will be needed.
It is proposed that California shall
cede to the National Government her
interest in the lands which will be
laid bare by the lowering of the water
in the lakes; but as these lands will be
sold only to actual settlers and the
proceeds used, together with other
funds, to meet the expenses of the un
dertaking, it would seem that this
State can well afford to give its assent
if Oregon will do likewise, as it is be
lieved that it will. There are 300,000
acres, two-thirds in California and
one-third in Oregon, which. It is
claimed, can thus be reclaimed and ir
rigated. To accomplish this It will be
necessary to draw water from Upper
Klamath lakes in Oregon to irrigate
lands in California, and, likewise, from
Clear Lakeâa smaller body of water
lying to the east of Rhett Lake, in
California âto irrigate lands across the
line in Oregon. The different levels of
the lakes relative to the areas they are
expected to irrigate make necessary
this reciprocal arrangement, and it
cannot be doubted that the two com
monwealths ought to co-operate heart
ily in what is likely to prove so great
a common advantage.
DEFINITE FOREST
POLICY IS WANTED
IN GOLDEN STATE
It Is well known that the cutting of
large areas of timber, and the pur
chase by speculators of still larger
areas, with the presumed intent of
felling and marketing the lumber pro
duct, threaten the premature exhaus
tion of one of California's most pre
cious resources. In view of these facts
California could have entered upon no
wiser course than it did in providing
for the serious study of her forest
problems.
Our civilization rests upon the right
of the individual to have and to hold
property, real, personal and mixed.
This right needs to be Jealously
guarded and yet such rights are not
recognised as absolute. Bach owner
must "so use his own as not to injure
another's property." Especially is it
true that no individual or generation
of Individuals can be permitted to de
stroy an inheritance. Regard must be
had for the welfare of generations yet
unborn. We, who are here now, will
in time pass away, but the common
wealth of California will endure, and
it is for an enduring commonwealth,
rather than for a present generation,
that you gentlemen are called together
in order that you may legislate.
There will be laid before you a care
fully drawn bill providing for a definite
forest policy for California. Without
venturing to pass upon its merits in
advance of thorough public and legis
lative discussion, I commend it to your
careful consideration. The 00-opera
tlve forestry work carried on during
the last two years by the State in
collaboration with the United States
Bureau of Forestry has proven highly
beneflcial in an educational sense, and
I respectfully recommend that It be
carried on for two years more under
the same arrangement.
In fact, I am led to hope that the ob
taining of expert knowledge as to how
to deal with forestry problems, includ
ing the prevention of forest fires and
the rehabilitation of deforested areas,
and the giving of a wide publicity to
that knowledge, may, of Itself, go far
toward evolving a useful, though vol
untary, policy of forest preservation.
In the event that the Legislature is
unable to see its way clear to adopt
a perfected forest-preservation policy
at this time, may it not be wise to
attempt at least tenatlve legislation
looking to that end?
The extension of the work of the
College of Agriculture of the University
is a subject which will probably en
gage the attention of this Legislature,
as it engaged that of the last. The
Importance of agricultural education is
now recognized everywhere, even in
quarters where It would have received
little consideration a few years ago;
and increased provision for Buch educa
tion is being made in all the great
States, the leading industries of some
of which have been reorganized and
made more profitable than ever through
the work of agricultural scientists.
No other State, perhaps, has in this
subject so deep an interest as Cali
fornia, whose products, soils, and cli
mates are so varied, and whose special
problems are so numerous. The suc
cessful employn * of irrigation and
the growing of the specialised crops,
which the local conditions make possi
ble, call for a higher standard of
scientific Information among tillers of
the soil than Is requisite for the pro
duction of ordinary staples in other
sections of our country. While the
holding of Farmers' Institutes and the
publication of bulletins from the State
Agricultural College may considerably
Inform the adult farming population,
there is a growing feeling among
thoughtful persons that our educational
system should be the means of rearing
up a generation of young persons
attracted by intelligent interest to
agricultural pursuits.
Already the State has profited largely
by the Investigations and experiments
conducted by the College of Agricul
ture, which has done a great deal of
valuable research work and has edu
cated a number of specialists of high
standing. The equipment of the col
lege in buildings and facilities, how
ever, Is inadequate to meet the de
mands laid upon it.
STATE UNIVERSITY
AND THE COLLEGE
OF AGRICULTURE
But the enrollment: of students in the
College of Agriculture falls below the
enrollment in other colleges and this
has led to the complaint that, however
successful in scientific researches the
institution has not been doing the work
It should along the lines of practical
instruction. The lack of a farm as an
adjunct to the university has been the
main reason for whatever failure there
may have been In this direction for
farming can only be taught on' the
farm. Neither is there any oppor
tunity to have the farm in close prox
imity to the university at Berkeley
and this Is a misfortune, since to have
the farm at a distance from the uni
versity involves an Increase of ex
pense and other disadvantages. The
time has arrived, however, when a
farm should be acquired and it should
be found in a region where the soil
and climate are fairly typical of our
largest agricultural areas. The locality
should be one carefully selected with
a view to working out the various
problems In agronomy, horticulture

.dairying, animal industries and other
branches of farming.
But wherever the farm is located and
whatever the course of instruction es
tablished thereon, there should be no
separation from university control, the
experience of other States showing that
the duplication of courses and conflicts
of interests where colleges of agricul
ture and State universities are inde
pendent of each other are bound to be
injurious to both. Neither are the so
called colleges of agriculture which are
conducted apart from universities gen
erally successful in attracting large
numbers of students in agriculture, the
engineering and other scientific courses
usually leading in popularity the pure
ly agricultural courses. Concentration,
not dispersion, is the true educational
policy and in no educational field is it
more necessary to bear this in mind
than in agricultural instruction, which,
on account of the equipment required,
i 6 confessedly more expensive than al
most any other.
In what way the courses of instruc
tion on the farm can best be organ
ized is a question that must be deter
mined when the time comes, but it is
likely that they will be largely popular
in character. They must be so if they
are to draw large numbers of students,
for in no agricultural college or depart
ment Is the number of full four-year
course men very large, while the most
successful schools of agriculture and
the short courses draw many students
and meet the needs of a majority of
those who will become actual farm
ers.
The burden of the expense of caring
for the insane In the State hospitals,
which amounts now to about $900,000
per annum, has been growing year by
year, and will of course, continue to
grow with the Increase of population;
but there is hope that hereafter it will
grow at a less rapid rate than former
ly. There has been a material falling
off in the average annual rate of In
crease of patients, due not to fewer ad
missions, but to a larger number of
deaths and discharges. The increased
number of deaths is explained by the
greater average age of the patients,
while the more numerous discharges
may be explained in part by more suc
cessful treatment, resulting in more
recoveries, and in part by a change of
administrative methods. A factor of
considerable importance is the legali
zation of the parole system under the
new law. There are now from two to
three hundred patients out on parole
all the tisjist. and many of the dis
charges are made from among those
whose fitness to go at large has first
been tested in this manner.
The establishment of the Commis
sion in Lunacy, seven years ago, did
much to give the State definite and
permanent policy In the conduct of its
hospitals. Previous to that time each
<>f the five hospitals was governed en
tirely by Its own board of trustees, and
no matter how faithful the members
of these boards might be, there could
not be the same system in the manage
ment of the Institutions as if there
were supervision by a common author-
ity. This the Commission in Lunacy
has established, and the effect of its
careful revision of estimates and
scrutiny of accounts may be seen in
the fact that since it was created there
has never been a deficiency in the sup
port fund of any one of the hospitals.
In future. If present policies con
tinue to prevail, there will be an avoid
ance of both an Increase in the num
ber of hospitals and of the erection
of very large buildings in adding to
the accommodations of existing hospi
tals. Cottages can be built for the
patients at less per capita cost, and
this method of housing them is more
in accord with the current medical
opinion of what Is more desirable. A
number of cottages have already been
constructed by applying to this use the
contingent funds of some of the hos
pitals, and others will be provided for
in the same way.
In the direction of specialization in
the treatment of the Insane the prin
cipal innovations are the proposed hos
pital for the criminal Insane, the erec
tion of which at Folsom after an ap
propriation had been made was neces
sarily postponed on account of an un
fortunate oversight committed in draw
ing the statute; the establishment of a
separate department in two detached
buildings at Agnews for the acutely in
sane, and the adoption of the tent plan
at Uklah for the insane who are af
flicted with tuberculosis. In each of
these Instances the new departure Is
in a direction which is sanctioned by
the best authority. The acutely insane
can be treated with more hope of cure
If cared for under the special condi
tions best adapted to them, and tent
accommodations for the tuberculous in
sane are deemed the most healthful.
The collections on account of pay
patients are more closely made than
formerly, through the methods Intro
duced by the Commission in Lunacy. It
was also owing to the secretary of that
body that a very serious shortage in
the accounts of a former clerk in the
Southern California State Hospital was
discovered, and since then a checking
system has been devised which Is ex
pected to remove the opportunities for
such frauds.
NATIONAL GUARD
IS DESERVING OF
PROPER SUPPORT
Having been either a member of or
greatly interested in the National
â¢ â  Guard of California since 1872, a period
of over thirty-two years, and having
. risen in it from the lowest to the high
est rank, I think I can reasonably say
that I have some knowledge of it.
Upon the proper support of the Na
tional Guard of the various States de
pends to a very great extent the safety
of this nation in its relations with for
eign powers, for in the event of a for
eign war it is necessary for the United
States to have an army either for for
eign service or to repel Invasion. If
there were no National Guard it would
be necessary for the Government to do
either one of two things, viz., to sup
port a large standing army or to rely
upon raising the necessary volunteer
armies from a raw, untrained, un
ci rilled, undisciplined people. A large
standing army Is for many reasons un
desirable. On the other hand, to rely
upon raising, equipping, drilling and
disciplining out of totally inexperienced
volunteers an army to fight against the
trained troops of other nations would
he disastrous.
In the late war with Spain it was
demonstrated that the National Guard
can be depended on to fight our coun
try's battles. The First California (to
take an example with which we are all
familiar) took the field reasonably well
armed, equipped, drilled, disciplined,
officered and rendered service that
made us all proud of every man on its
roster.
To have newly recruited this regi
ment out of totally inexperienced vol
unteers would have required several
weeks. To have officered, armed,
equipped, drilled, disciplined it, would
have required many more weeks; and,
in the meantime, disaster might have
resulted to our cause. But with many
National Guard regiments, like the
First California, from the various
States, to draw from, the United States
was able quickly to put into the Philip
pines and Cuba armies which brought
the war to a swift decision in our favor,
saved many, many lives, which, with a
long-drawn struggle would have been
sacrificed, to say nothing of the mil
lions of treasure that otherwise would
have been necessary and the disturb
ance of business and trade that would
have resulted.
Where would we have been In that
war had we not had a navy, with
Dewey, Schley and Sampson in com
mand? We could neither have beaten
Spain nor invaded Cuba nor the Philip
pines, even had we the best army In
the world. And, without our National
Guard, from which quickly to form
armies of invasion, Dewey's victory at
Manila Bay and Sampson's and
Schley's destruction of Cervera's fleet
would have netted us only a modicum
of what resulted from our swift and
sure attacks on sea and land.
Therefore, I am of the opinion that
those of our fellow-citizens who de
precate the existence of the National
Guard, and would abolish It, have not
given the matter sufficient thought.
Our flag, our national honor, our
citizens, and our trade and commerce
must be protected. To do this requires
a navy and either a great standing
army (which God forbid!) or a suf
ficient number of our people trained
quickly to form efficient armies. And
there Is, I think, but one way to do this,
and that is by supporting, encouraging
and maintaining State National
Guards, in which shall be preliminarily
trained in the art of war the youth of
the country.
Not only so, but there is great need
that the youth of the country shall be
taught discipline and a cheerful obedi
ence to constituted authority. For in
our land of liberty there is liable to
arise in the mind of the individual an
idea that he owes nothing to his fellow
citizens, his city, his county, his State,
his country or his flag. No other where
than in the National Guard is the in
dividual so well taught to respect the
authority of those who, for the mo
ment, may be his superior officers. No
other where than in the National
Guard does he come into such close
contact with the flag of his country and
learn to look upon it as the symbol of
his political and personal liberties. No
other where does he so well learn that
"in union there is strength," that he is
one American citizen, whose life, liber
ty, pursuit of happiness and property
are safest only when those of his fellow
citizens are also safest. He comes out
of the National Guard a better, safer
citizen, loving his country better; more
jealous of, because he knows them bet
ter, his rights and privileges as a citi
zen of this great nation; more impress
ed with, because he has learned some
thing of them, his responsibilities tow
ard those who, like him, are also
Americans; with greater respect for
the law and those empowered to en
force it and, above all, Impressed with
the idea that, after all, there is no
greater, purer, more patriotic duty than
to serve his country In her hour of
greatest need.
DUTY OF CITIZENS
TO ENCOURAGE THE
STATE'S MILITIA
Therefore I am of the opinion that it
is the duty of every American citizen,
who loves the flag and our Institutions,
to encourage every young man to be
come a member of the National Guard
and thus somewhat fit himself to de
fend his flag and his country if the
occasion should require. And I have
but little sympathy with those who,
from shortsightedness, ignorance or
any other cause, desire to see it abol
ished. And, therefore, I recommend to
the Legislature to provide a sufficient
sum for the support and maintenance
of the National Guard of California and
to render it, already reasonably effi
cient, still more so.
At the last session of the Legislature
there were submitted several commit
tee reports upon the condition of the
two State prisons and in one of these,
which was made by a select committee
of the Assembly, the following lan
guage was employed:
Our two prisons are no credit to the State.
California boaats Its place In the front rank of
States, but her prisons lag a generation behind
the better class of Eastern penitentiaries.
The two prisons are schools of vice'and uni
versities of crime. â¢ â¢ â¢
Boys and young men, guilty of one ofTense
against the laws, but not yet hardened in
crime, are sent to these prisons not to be re
claimed, but to be systematically seduced and
debased by utterly degraded convicts. Asso
ciated for a term of years with men whose vil
lainy is their boaat, young men graduate from
these institutions fully equipped enemlea of
society. Thus the State trains its criminals.
* â¢ â¢ The responsibility of this great wrong
rests primarily not with the wardens, nor with
the Board of Prison Directors, but upon the
people of California, who have followed a false
Idea of economy and. steeped in neglect of
public affairs, have failed to provide means
for the proper conduct of these Institutions.
If this language is to be regarded not
as rhetorical exaggeration, put as ex
pressing the deliberate Judgment of
the legislators who framed the official
report quoted from, it constitutes a
serious arraignment of the prisons in
which the State now confines twenty
four hundred convicts. Yet this report
does not differ greatly from a number
of other reports which, from time to
time, have been presented by Senate
and Assembly committees and by in
vestigating commissions. There are no
other State institutions which have
been so often investigated and for
whose betterment so many recommen
dations have been made, and yet the
progress of improvement has been
very slow.
The main defects of our prison sys
temâwhich may be summed up as lack
of classification and segregation of the
convicts, lack of cell and yard accom
modations and lack of intelligent
adaptation of means to ends in re
formatory treatmentâhave been not
only recognized but quite well under
stood for a long time. They were
pointed out by a Joint Senate and
Assembly Committee in 1872âthirty
three years agoâas clearly as by the
committee of 1903 whose report I have
already quoted, and the most import
ant recommendation recently made by
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4. 1905.
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE
THE extension of the work of the College of Agriculture of the
university is a subject which probably will engage the attention of
this Legislature, aS it engaged that of the last. The importance of agri
cultural education is now recognized everywhere, even in quarters where
it would have received little consideration a few years ago, and increased
provision for such education is being made in all the great States. The
lack of a farm as an adjunct to the university has been the main reason
for whatever failure there may have been in this direction, for farming
can only be taught on the farm. The time has arrived, however, when a
farm should be acquired.
Farm in Connection With University Needed for the
Research of Soil and Products.
the State Board of Charitiesâwhich
was that one of the prisons be con
verted Into a reformatoryâwas antici
pated as lohg ago as 1876, when a
legislative committee reported senten
tlously: "Establish a reformatory in
connection with the State prison at as
early a day as possible."
Indeed, it seems to have been one of
the original ideas with which Folsom
prison was established that either it or
San Quentin would be made a prison
for first offenders and conducted on
reformatory lines, while the other
would be used for the Isolation and
punishment of hardened criminals.
Yet, disregarding the opportunity
which the existence of two prisons has
given for differentiation in their uses.
we have gone on for thirty years com
mitting young and old, confirmed
recidivists and first offenders, indis
criminately to both prisons, thereby
helping to make both "schools of vice
and universities of crime." This long
persistence in a radical error, when it
could have been avoided by a simple
change in the law, appears, like some
other things in the history of our deal
ings with penal problems, not to reflect
credit upon our Intelligence. In the
past there has been a vast amount of
talk about the defects of our prison
system, and, as I have already shown,
there has been no real difference of
opinion in regard to the things to be
done; it has only been when it came to
the essential matter, of doing them that
a naralysis has fallen upon us. But
has not the time at last arrived when
there should be action, and not much
else? It would seem so when we con
template the fact that the two prisons
have, combined, but 878 cells and rooms
for nearly 2400 prisoners, and that at
San Quentin the herding in the re
stricted yard is almost as bad as the
overcrowding in the sleeping quarters.
The main reason for delay In Improv
ing the condition of the prisons has
been, as the Assembly committee re
ported two years ago, that of expense.
Money in liberal sums has been appro
priated for support, and occasionally,
when forced to do so by the absolute
necessity of the situation, the Legisla
ture has provided means to expand
prison accommodations; but appropria
tions of the latter class have always
been so long delayed that when Anally
furnished they have not made the facil
ities equal to the demands upon them.
If the grossest forms of vice run riot
In the prisons it Is because the deficient
cell accommodations render herding
necessary, and the obvious remedy is
to give each prisoner his separate cell.
If no educational work worthy of the
name Is done in either prison It is be
cause the lack of facilities puts it out
of the question.
LACK OF PROPER
FACILITIES CAUSE
OF JAIL OUTBREAKS
The most memorable event of the
past two years was the outbreak of
July 27, 1903, at Folsom, when the War
den and other officers were overpow
ered, one officer was killed and thirteen
prisoners escaped, they afterward kill
ing two members of a military com
pany who were trying to effect their
capture. This deplorable affair, which
cost the State dear in money and dear
er in the lives of citizens, may also be
attributed to lack of a properly exe
cuted building plan, since such an
emeute would have small chance for
success in a well-walled and well-ar-
ranged prison.
With regard to the futile attempt to
escape which was made a few days
since by a number of desperate con
victs, who paid dearly for their temer
ity, it can only be said that under dif
ferent circumstances it might never
have been made, and that its speedy
frustration shows that the discipline
and effectiveness of the prison forces
have been greatly improved during the
last year and a half.
It is not a pleasant duty to recom
mend the expenditure of large sums of
money upon State prisons. It is nat
ural to feel that money will be better
spent in supporting schools and col
leges or in building public highways,
or in any one of a dozen other ways.
Nevertheless, it is a short-sighted pol
icy, because in the long run a very
costly one, to support prisons which
foster crime rather than abate it, and
enlightened statesmanship demands
that California shall do what other
States have done and spend money
enough on the prisons to equip them
properly. I feel it my duty to say that
the present session of the Legislature
ought not to close without a substan
tial beginning having been made in the
necessary work of prison reform.
It is the judgment of the Board of
State Prison Directors, as expressed to
me, that building improvements should
be commenced at once at both prisons
and continued until the present and im
mediately prospective prison population
has been fully provided for. Folsom
Prison should be supplied with a wall,
as contemplated by the original plans.
Nearly all the work on buildings and
wall can be performed with convict la
bor, and the cost can be kept down
accordingly. At Folsom, where granite
is abundant, the new cellhouse can be
constructed of that material and the
wall also. If the cost of transporta
tion would not be too great granite
could also be quarried there for the
new buildings at San Quentin. But
there must be a liberal appropriation
for the purchase of materials other
than stone and for the incidental ex
penses of building.
How soon it will be possible to con
vert one of the two prisons into a re
formatory depends largely upon the
progress of the necessary reconstruc
tion, which must precede everything
else. It would be well, however, for
the Legislature to reach a decision
which of the two prisons shall become
the reformatory and which shall re
main an ordinary penitentiary, as un
til that question is settled a proper
building plan cannot be adopted.
Oaly second to the reformtion prob-
lem in our prisons is the industrial one.
California has been less fortunate than
Missouri, Minnesota and a number of
other States, which make their prisons
self-supporting, or even operate them
at a profit; nor is it to be expected
such results can be achieved under the
conditions prevailing here. Indeed, it
is doubted by many if anywhere the
operation of a prison at a profit is con
sistent with the highest regard for the
interests of the prisoners or of the
public. But Folsom Prison has no
productive industry except the crush
ing and sale of macadam rock, which
has returned a profit of only a few
thousand dollars a year, and even this
business Is now threatened by the ex
haustion of the quarry.
The strongest argument for the es
tablishment of a prison at Folsom" was
the industrial one, since It was antici
pated that the granite quarries would
be the basis of a remunerative indus
try. This expectation was never ful
filled, the sales of granite in former
years seldom exceeding $10,000 per an
num and never going above $21,000.
For some years the sale of prison-cut
granite has been forbidden by law. If
new buildings and a wall are con
structed the employment problem will
solve Itself for some time to come, but
eventually a new Industry, or Indus
tries, must be found for this prison. At
San Quenttn the Jutemill gives em
ployment to about 800 of the 1500 pris
oners and runs at a profit, ordinarily,
of $40,000 or $50,000 a year.
It costs the State about $250,000 annu
ally to maintain its prisons, and it Is
desirable that the prison earnings
should be as large as they can properly
be made, In order that the taxpayers
may be spared, but profit does not ap
pear to have been considered desirable
when the laws fixing prices of prison
products were framed. The selling
price of jute bags must be not more
than one cent per bag in excess of
actual cost, not counting the value of
convict labor, and macadam rock is to
be sold at not more than ten per cent
above the oost of production. The
price actually charged is thirty cents
per ton. A valid objection to this pol
icy Is that it renders it impossible to
afford prisoners an opportunity to earn
a little money on their own account,
which they may save and receive when
they are discharged, and thus go out
with some experience of the habits of
voluntary industry and thrift-
It seems probable that the best solu
tion of the prison labor problem will
be found in the New York system of
manufacturing necessary articles for
State Institutions, whereby employment
can be diversified, and at the same
time direct competition with free labor
be avoided.
These two schools constitute the
present reformatory institutions of
California, as distinguished from the
penal. There Is some increase in num
bers of the youths committed, but
not out of proportion to the numerical
increase of the population of the State.
Indeed, we may look with hopeful
anticipation to a decrease in the num
ber of commitments as our systems
of juvenile courts, detention homes, and
probation officers become more gener
ally and efficiently organized. The
aim of those in authority, and especi
ally of parents, should be to keep
children away from such institutions
rather than to encourage their commit
ment. The best place for an erring, if
not incorrigible or criminal, lad or lass
is In the paternal home, or, lacking this,
in the home of some reputable citizen
possessed of a rugged will accom
panied by reasonable forbearance.
There are few higher claims which con
siderations of humanity Impose upon
good citizenship than that of redeem
ing to honorable and fruitful living our
wayward youths and children.
If California is to perform this ser
vice collectively It must adequately
capitalize and equip the institutions es
tablished for that purpose. This has
not been fully done. The schools at
both lone and Whlttler are inadequate
ly supplied with teachers and appar
atus, and it is my Judgment that both
of these schools should be made essen
tially agricultural in theory and in
practice. It would be possible on the
school farms as they now exist, with
the proper instructors and equipment,
to teach the lads committed to them
at least the elements of scientific agri
culture, including dairying, poultry
raising, fruit-growing, and market
gardening, and to these ends the indus
trial features should mainly tend. I
believe that the most fortunate results
would attend such a policy, but some
additional means will be required to
carry it out.
In relation to the redemption of way
ward girls I cannot speak with so
much confidence. That problem is es
sentially different from the reclamation
of a wayward boy and I am not sure
that a public institution can bring to
bear upon the subject in hand all those
personal influences which make for the
salvation of those under Its charge. It
may be that a better way would be to
commit such young women to benevo
lent institutions provided for that pur
pose, choice to be made in the dis
cretion of the court, the expense to be
borne by the State and county as now,
such institutions to be subjected to
State and judicial inspection. The ex
pense to the taxpayers would be one
half less per capita than at present and
the results are not unlikely to be more
fortunate.
In the event of such a course being
found advisable, the buildings now
oonstituting the Girls* School at Whit
tier could be made available for boys
of a certain grade, thereby facilitating
a much needed further gradation and
distribution of the boys with regard to
their ages and degrees of delinquency.
WHITTIER REFORM
SCHOOL SUBJECT
OF INVESTIGATION
In the performance of Its duties the
State Board of Charities and Correc
tions recently made some investigations
Into the management of Whlttier State
School and reported its conclusions re
garding certain charges, which I have
since caused to be further investigated.
I think that I can safely absolve the
management from the implication of
deliberate intent to convert public
property to private and personal ad
vantages, but a most unfortunate and
regrettable laxness of method of doing
public business has been made mani
fest in many ways. A seeming neces
sity, or even convenience, has prompt
ed the evasion of laws and regulations
in order that ends which could not be
accomplished directly might be attain
ed by indirection and circumvention.
It is not a satisfactory excuse that all
of these things were done for the bene
fit of the school, or of the pupils in the
school, or that what was converted to
private advantage in one instance was
more than made good In another by
personal service or personal expendi
ture. It is essential that the laws be
obeyed and that those methods of do
ing business which time and custom
have sanctioned as orderly and wise
be followed without deviation.
It is not sufficient that a public offi
cial shall attend to public business as
he would attend to his own. He must
attend to public business as the laws
require and guard its details with a
more exemplary circumspection.
Appended to this message will be
found the list of pardons, commuta
tions and reprieves granted from Jan
uary 7, 1903, to January 1, 1906, which
are reported as required by law. As
there stated there have been eight par
dons, twenty commutations and fifteen
reprieves. In all. two or three hundred
clemency applications have been pre
sented to me. Three of the pardons
were granted to persons who had al
ready served their terms of imprison
ment and were free men when par
doned, the object being to effect their
restoration to citizenship, they having
shown themselves worthy of it. In
this connection I suggest that section
1693 of the Penal Code, which author
izes the Governor to grant restoration
by a simple executive order to a prison
er who Is about to be discharged, be
so amended as to authorize restoration
In a similar manner to one who after
discharge has made a sincere effort
to be a good citizen.
While the pardoning power is univer
sally recognized as a necessary one,
and has been provided for under all
forms of Government, the extent and
manner of Its exercise are matters
concerning which much difference of
opinion exists. In the view of one
olass of citizens, who usually have had
little personal contact with crime or
criminals, almost any interference with
the full execution of sentences imposed
by the courts is an evidence of weak
ness on the part of the executive,
though it might be added that when
persons of this class become interested
in the case of a single lawbreaker,
they become sympathetic to such a de
gree that they want him liberated at
once, and cannot understand why the
Governor, who probably has received
a hundred applications equally merlt
orous, should refuse such a request.
Some of the substantial reasons why
pardons or commutations should be
granted come to be understood by those
who are brought Into direct contact
with the problems of practical penology
either as Warden, Prison Director or
Governor. It is the testimony of all
prison officials, I believe, that an occa
sional pardon or commutation, if given
to the right person, is one of the most
effective stimulants to discipline, be
cause it keeps hope alive in the con
vict and gives him an Incentive to good
conduct. The same is true of the credit
system, by which all convicts for terms
of years can abridge their periods of
confinement, and the parole system
two modifications of former laws which
are among the most Important ad
vances in penology in California, al
though both acts were severely criti
cized when passed. \
Another good ground for the occa
sional extension of executive clemency
is found in the number of instances
in which Judges write to the Governor
to tell him they have discovered that
they erred in fixing the degree of pun
ishment for a crime. There are other
instances of simple blunders such as
are bound to occur everywhere In the
administration of law. One man
whose sentence I commuted had plead
ed guilty to a felony, though, as was
afterward found, he could not have
been guilty of a greater offense than
misdemeanor. Again, several prison
ers are now serving life sentences in
this State because of an error in a
statute which said that a person con
victed of robbery who should have
been previously convicted of a misde
meanor should be so punished, al
though the same requirement was not
made where the previous conviction
had been for felony. This peculiar
blunder of the statute was corrected
by amendment two years ago.
Tet, a Governor can nbt use the
pardoning power, to correct all the In
justices of unequal sentences, even
when their equality is gross and palp
able, though such inequalities are well
understood by convicts and are a cause
of much sullen discontent within pris
on wal's. It is impossible that a Gov
ernor should undertake to review ju
dicial proceedings and equalize all pun
ishments, und more harm than good
would result from the attempt to do
it
I have assumed that a conditional
commutation, which will be a restraint
upon future conduct, is better than a
commutation which is unconditional,
and, with this irr mind, I have inserted
in such documents a provision that if
the person be subsequently convicted
of felony he must serve out the unex
pired portion of his former term of im
prisonment, as well as his new one.
This makes the commutation, or par
don, in effect, a kind of parole. This
condition is one that has seldom, if
ever, been attached to pardons or com
mutations of sentence In this State,
but I believe the wisdom of it as a de
terrant can not be questioned. That
this policy is not unreasonable, or
mere surplusage, is confirmed in the
case of William Grider, who received,
SCARCITY OF INSTRUCTORS 4
IS DUE TO POOR SALARIES
Wage of Educators Not Sufficient
to Reimburse Them for Time
Given to Study.
for services rendered on the occasion
of the Folsom break, a conditional
commutation of sentence. A few
months after his release he was again
convicted of a felony and sentenced
to a term in San Quentin prison. The
confidence reposed in him was mis
placed, and he will be compelled to
serve out the remainder of his old
sentence as well as the sentence last
Imposed upon him.
FUNDS FOR ORPHANS
AND CHILDREN WHO
NEED STATE AID
One of the largest, and at the same
time most beneficent, expenditures of
our State Government Is that for the
partial support of orphans, half or
phans and abandoned children. "Want
ing official machinery for a thorough
State administration of this fund, it
has been necessary mainly to depend
for Its proper distribution upon the
good offices of the orphanages and
boards of supervisors through whose
hands It passes. I have every reason
to believe that this trust Is almost al
ways conscientiously and efficiently
executed; and yet this form of admin
istration does afford some opportunity
for persons actuated by the spirit of
mendicancy to impose upon the State
unnecessary burdens.
In dealing with this class of claims
renewed efforts have been made, and
are making, to eliminate from the roll
all claims which represent an attempt
to impose upon the public generosity,
and I am glad to be able to say that
substantial success is being attained
in this direction. For the fifty-fifth
fiscal year the expenditures under this
head were $38,000 less than for the
fifty-fourth. This saving represents
the results of the Investigations made.
and new methods employed, by the late
Walter S. Melick, Secretary of the
State Board of Examiners, and to him
the credit primarily belongs.
I am glad to say that, in most of the
orphanages supported in part by this
fund, attention is given to the element
ary training in useful employments of
the children, and I suggest to the Leg
islature that it might be well to couple
with the appropriations a provision re
quiring all institutions drawing from
this fund to give to children of suf
ficient age to receive It some form of
useful industrial or manual training,
the standard of Instruction to be made
satisfactory to the State Board of Ex
aminers.
The report of the State Board of
Health shows that the health of the
commonwealth has, during the year just
closed. If not during te whole of the
year preceding, been quite free from
injurious distempers and malignant
contagion. I take this occasion to call
to the minds of legislators the urgent
need for affording to the State Board
such added facilities for work as it
may require.
I have also to congratulate the State
of California upon the cordial and con
fidential relations existing between our
State and municipal boards of health
and the public health and marine hos
pital service of the United States and
the boards of health of the several
States of our Union. There was a time
when California stood in imminent
peril of being universally quarantined
against because of the existence of a
few sporadic cases of Asiatic plague.
Rigid remedial measures have been in
stituted, confidence has been re-estab
lished and the business of the common
wealth has been allowed to proceed un
hampered. The health of the people
within the State and without was in
nowise impaired by reason of an inci
dent which, inasmuch as California
ports are dealing constantly, directly
and Increasingly with Asiatic ports,
constituted merely one of the draw
backs Inseparable from commercial and
maritime pursuits. The best safeguard
our people can have against serious
consequences resulting therefrom Is to
maintain a fully equipped system for
the preservation of the public health
and for the dissemination among our
people of reliable and timely informa
tion.
During the preceding session of the
Legislature I felt compelled to veto a
series of bills intended to modify the
law to give railroads rights of way
through overflowed and other public
lands of the State. I believed the bills
as passed did not sufficiently guard the
State's interests and hence acted as
above stated, although at the time it
was urged on behalf of the measures
that ar the law stands there is no way
in which a transportation company can
acquire the right to occupy overflowed
State land within an incorporated city,
or within three miles of it, to be used
for necessary wharves, piers and other
structuros. Some time afterward it
was reported that overflowed land be
longing to the State of California In
Oakland harbor was being filled In and
that (ac title might be claimed by a
corporation which was understood to
be paying a dredging contractor to de
posit the soil on this land.
I decided to ask the Attorney General
of the State for an opinion and I re
quested him to make It broad enough
to clear up most of the questions in
volving the State's rights In and con
trol over water fronts.- He was asked
to state by what means. If any, a rail
road corporation can acquire rights of
way over property such as above de
scribed, also, if such rights can be ac
quired, by what tenure the land will be
afterward held, besides other ques
tions.' The object of this request for
an opinion was to ascertain what the
law is, with a view to the correction of
defects, or the supplying Of omissions,
if either exist.
After some delay, due to the large
amount of legal work which he is at all
times called upon to attend to, the At
torney General furnished me with an
opinion in which he treated the ques
tions asked as relating particularly to
the situation in Oakland harbor.
In answering the question first raised
the Attorney General, after citing vari
ous authorities, said:
The result of all this seems to be that there
Is no procedure laid down in the codes of Cali
fornia by which a railroad corporation may ac
quire a right of way for the location and
maintenance of roadbeds, tracks, wharves,
piers, tilips, or terminal facilities over sub
merged lands beyond the corporate limits of
the city of Oakland, which limits are the ordi
nary low tide line, and that the only method
left for such a corporation to pursue is to ob
tain a special grant from the Legislature.
WELL-GUARDED LAW
FOR THE SUBMERGED
LANDS OF STATE
If this state of facts obtains as to
Oakland, it must also obtain as to any
other city or town which is placed as
Oakland is, and the need of a State
policy in respect to water fronts appears
to be Indicated. Such a policy should
be carefully considered, in order that
laws framed in accordance with it may
be liberal enough to encourage enter
prise and yet conservative enough to
prevent monopolization of valuable
privileges and to protect the rights and
interests of the State in water-front
property. Commercial opportunities
are beneficial only as they are utilized,
and the building of wharves, piers and
docks promotes the eeneral welfare.
There should, therefore, be some well
guarded law under which the right to
occupy submerged State land, within
or near, incorporated cities for these
purposes may be facilitated and regu
lated.
As the lands under navigable water
are held by the State only In trust,
for the promotion of commerce. It can
never entirely alienate such lands, and
it Is a question to be determined by the
State Government what tne tenure of
the occupants shall be. Some States,
like the State of Washington, on this
coast, and the State of Massachusetts,
on the Atlantic coast, grant leases for
long terms of years, and charge rentals.
If legislation should be had on this sub
ject, and it should be determined that
the leasehold policy is the most expedi
ent one for California, the rentals
should not be fixed so high as to deter
enterprise. The primary aim should
be to develop commerce; the collection
of revenue from this source, while de
sirable in itself, is secondary.
In referring to the filling In of State
land by the deposit of dredgings, the
Attorney General expresses the opinion
that lands raised above the water by
artificial means are not subject to the
principle that controls accretion, and
no legal title can be based on such act.
Several newspapers having published
articles making charges that the ex
aminations of candidates for licenses by
the State Board of Pharmacy were not
fairly conducted, I decided to order an
investigation. For this purpose Hon.
John F. Davis, Code Commissioner;
Hon. G. R. Lukens, a member of the
Senate, and Dr. F. W. Hatch, general
superintendent of State hospitals, were
appointed a special commission and in
structed to inquire in a general way
into all the transactions of the board.
On August 15, 1904, the commission as
sembled in San Francisco and began
the investigation, which continued from
day to day until August 23. The mem
bers of the Board of Pharmacy, a num
ber of persons who had been candidates
at recent examinations and others were
examined, and the report of the com
mittee, with a transcript of the testi
mony taken, has recently been put in
my hands.
In brief, the conclusions reached by
the commission of investigation are
that the State Board of Pharmacy has
served the purpose of its creation by
regulating the practice of the profes
sion; that the charges made in the
newspaper articles before referred to
had little foundation so far as they al
leged intentional unfairness or discrim
ination between different candidates;
that, nevertheless, sufficiently strict
regulations to exclude the possibility of
Improper practices at examinations had
not been made and enforced; that it is
a mistake to maintain the office of the
Board of Pharmacy In the building of
one of two rival colleges of pharmacy;
that it Is unjust, if not illegal, to col
lect under the name of arrearages a
charge of $2 a year from former li
centiates for all the years they may
have been out of practice or practicing
In some other State before they are al
lowed to recommence practice hero,
and, finally, that there are a number
of amendments to the law which It
would be very desirable to make.
In accordance with the law which
prescribes that it shall be the duty of
the Governor to report to the Legisla
ture at each session all judgments ren
dered against the State and not there
tofore reported, the following list of
Judgments is submitted, all of them be

From the report of the Attorney Gen
eral I learn that a money judgment
was finally obtained against the State
in an action entitled Lucy Jane Har
vey vs. Board of Trustees of Whittler
State School et al.. a suit which was
instituted many years ago and was
decided against the State in the lower
court. An appeal was prosecuted, and
on March 17, 1904, the Supreme Court
affirmed the judgment. The action was
one for damages on account of the vio
lation of a lease, and the amount of
the judgment is $1035, with interest
and costs. I am informed by the Board
of Trustees of the Whittler School that
there are no available funds from
which this judgment can be paid, and
that, in the opinion of said board, an
appropriation by the Legislature will
have to "be made to meet the same.
The only other actions in which
Judgments against the State have
been affirmed are what are commonly
known as the "coyote scalp" cases. The

WEDNESDAYÂ»...Â». ... ... .. .JANUARY 4, 1Â»0S
THE long delayed surrender of Port Arthur added to the record
of military achievement, but at the expense of many lives.
Stoessel's refusal to permit the exit of non-combatants sacrificed
many thousands who had no direct part in the defense, but who
rather incumbered it by adding to the drain on the commissary and
the work of the hospitals.
The fall of the fortress for the present disorganizes the plans of
Russia. The Baltic fleet was undoubtedly dispatched to the East in
the expectation that it would raise the siege by sea, but the siege is
over while the fleet is still south of the equator and Russia has no
home port on the Pacific to which it can resort except Vladivostock,
which is probably closed by ice and would have been unavailable
anyway in the presence of Togo's ships. The disposition of that
fleet becomes of immediate diplomatic interest. It is now resting in
a port of France, the ally of Russia. But that port is too far away
for a naval base, and as France is a neutral its stay should be limited
by the law of neutrality.
The French press exhibits great dejection over the loss of Port
Arthur and appeals to fear and prejudice by the outcry that Japan's
occupancy of that fortress is a menace to Europe. This will not
be believed in England and the United States. It is folly to
say that Japan can be a menace to Europe. Her war is defensive.
Port Arthur in Russian possession was a menace to her. She took it
from China fairly and was robbed of her victory by Russia. Re
stored now to China, it will cease to be a menace to Japan, which Is
all that empire seems to desire. If restored to China it will be, no
doubt, with some form of security that will prevent Russia coercing
China to regain possession of it. The world will respect Japan's
declaration that an honorable peace would now be welcome. There
is no doubt friendly intervention would end the war if Russia were
willing. She is in the East at all by reason of craft and cunning, and
the nations have but little sympathy for her misfortunes. Peace
would be a blessing to the whole world, which is sickened and sor
rowing over the appalling carnage. If peace could come it would
cause rejoicing everywhere. The prolongation of the war is recog
nized as carrying the risk of involving other nations.
From the military side the long resistance of Stoessel is im
pressive. But the success of Nogi is more so. At the long siege of
Sebastopol the forces of several nations opposed Russia. At Port
Arthur, stronger than Sebastopol, Japan fought alone. There is
every evidence, too, that she played the hard game of war according
to the rules and scores of thousands of her brave sons fell face to the
entrenched enemy. One soldier in the protection of a fortress being
equal to ten in a besieging force the forty thousand Russians in the
fort tactically outnumbered the Japanese by many thousands, and
this adds to the hard-won glory of Nogi.
It cannot be said that Russia played the game by the rules. The
destruction of war material after asking leave to capitulate is a vio
lation of the rules of war. Ammunition and ships must not be de
stroyed after a flag of truce has asked leave to surrender. While
Russia will applaud Stoessel's completion of the destruction of war
ships and of other material it dims his military reputation in the
estimation of the world.
One feature on the Japanese side is noticeable and appeals to
sentiment. They make no boast of their achievements, but speak of
the opposing soldiers with respect. Yamagata's dispatch to Nogi is
an example of this: "His Majesty, the Mikado, is pleased to state
that General Stoessel has rendered commendable service to his coun
try in the midst of difficulties and it is his Majesty's wish that mili
tary honors be shown him." This is far different from the ill-timed
boasting of General Kartzow, who escaped to Chefu, that one Rus
sian could whip three Japanese. The Russian soldiers fight well and
so do the Japanese, and the pity of it all is that the best blood of the
two nations is spent in a struggle that would never have been had
Russia shown respect for the rights of others.
All America hopes that the time is near when the far-sighted
policy of Secretary Hay will bring peace to the East, by the exten
sion of Chinese administrative entity and neutrality over Manchuria.
THE prompt and orderly organization of the Legislature is grati
fying to the State. It means a speedy choice of Senator and
steady work at legislation. It is hoped that an earnest effort will
be made, early in the session, to reform the scheme of assessing and
taxing property on the lines so thoughtfully studied out by the State
Grange. There are in sight many projects for mere social and social
istic measures which attempt to crystallize fads into doubtful re
forms. The time that may run to waste on these may well be de
voted to the needed tax reform.
The Legislature should also resubmit to the people the constitu
tional amendment putting American shipping on an equality with
foreign shipping by freeing it from local taxation. Unless this is
done the ships registered in our seaports'will steadily decline in num
ber. The economic reasons for such exemption are many and the
patriotic reasons are not few. We should not penalize the flag on
American ships by putting other flags above it in privilege. The
people were led astray on this proposition at the last election by
virulent misrepresentation of the purpose and scope of the amend
ment, and we are persuaded that they will correct their mistake if
given the opportunity.
The Legislature will act wisely, we believe, on a forestry statute,
to preserve that valuable resource of the State so necessary to ihe
equability of its climate and the fertility of its soil. It will also con
sider carefully the rectification of the rivers as put before it in the re
port of the engineers and will pay attention to the need of better
roads by providing a way for the construction 6f main thorough
fares in which the State has an interest as well as localities. The
demands of the State institutions for buildings and extensions are
very heavy and will need careful revision. There is much question
whether such costly buildings as are asked for are needed. More
room made comfortable may be given by cutting out the luxury of
equipment which is frequently a feature in these demands.
The needs of the university are great and should be sup
plied. It would be a great relief to those who administer that in
stitution if some permanent and progressive addition could be made
to its endowment, so that it will not have to go to every Legislature
hat in hand asking its dole. Improvidence of early administration,
which sacrificed its land grant instead of putting it under lease to'
await the increment of value which would mean millions, has Jo be
paid for now.
ON Thursday the committee appointed by the* River Conven
tion held in May last to report upon ways and means for
carrying out the recommendations of the engineers anent
the rectification of flood conditions in Californian rivers is to make
its report. At a meeting in the Palace Hotel, to be attended by Gov
ernor Pardee, such of the State's Congressmen and Congressmen
elect as are in the vicinity and the engineers directly interested, the
committee will report the substance of its labors of the past months
in the form of a practical working scheme for putting into effect the
extensive engineering feat that has been submitted by the experts.
Remedial measures for the floods that yearly cost the farmers of
the interior valleys thousands of dollars and render unnavigable the
two great waterways of the State are rapidly taking form. Since the
River Convention met in the spring three expert engineers from
without the State in consultation with the State Engineer have re
viewed the whole problem of the restraint of the Sacramento and em
bodied the results of their findings in a detailed report and recom
mendation. Secretary of War Taft has given the problem place in

WAYS AND MEANS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1905.
PERFECT LOVE MEANS
NEW LIFE.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
THERE is one phenomenon of
love, possible also to exalted
friendship between man and
woman, which seems to me an
exquisite proof of spiritual
ity. I refer to that curious flash of
sympathy that comes sometimes to
two people of sympathetic tempera
ment.
This is, I believe, the most perfect
human companionship possible. It Is
most strangely glorifying. You see in
your companion's face a pure and
high emotion, before which earth and
all its sordid claims drop utterly
away.
When love or friendship comes to
one in such a way it means new life,
and new reason for living. It marks
the beginning of a day that dawns
in fullness of joy, of the only morn
whose first hopeful mood, "Another
day before me," is not shadowed by
the depressing consciousness, "And
another day behind me."
Is it not a folly to treat love by the
scientific methods so popular in our
times, and subject it to analysis?

tion and deprecating the inability of the Government to stretch its
river appropriation to cover even in part the needs of our two
streams. Besides our representative in the President's Cabinet, Mr.
Metcalf, who is thoroughly conversant with the whole subject, we
have a solid delegation in Congress agreed upon the course of action
demanded by the situation.
The report of tjie River Convention's committee will be received
with especial interest since the project put forth by the engineers is a
monumental one and ways and means become the immediate ques
tions of the hour. Certain it is that the people of the State are
thoroughly aroused to the need of immediate and adequate action.
They will be guided in large measure by the wisdom of this com
mittee, whose careful study of the question renders its forthcoming
report authoritative.
When it comes to figuring- on the Souths representation we will show
that while we can permit the negro to register we cannot force him to vote

is in itself an assurance that In the
years to come Its Joys will be among
our fairest gems of memory.
It would not make the rich hues of
an American Beauty rose more beauti
ful to know by what process they are
formed from the soil. Certainly it
does not add to the splendor of the
zenith for one to realize that its deep
blue is produced by light shining
through a mist of dust particles
heavy with moisture. These facts are
Interesting and valuable, and to some
observers they may bring a renewed
pleasure in the wonders of the uni
verse. But they detract somewhat
from the delight of surprise with
which we look Into the azure deeps of
the heavens.
Knowledge Is likely to mean disil
lusionment in some degree. We adults
see the world with sober eyes because
we know so much. The children are
happier; to them the gift and glitter
of a pageant is real gold; the woods
are elfland, and the light comes in at
the window every morning just for
them.
This mood which longs for fantasy
and fairy tale rs not permanent with
me, I must confess. It comes and goes
like moonlight from a lightly clouded
sky. But while it lasts I revel in it.
It brings such soft enchantments to
the senses. It carries the sweet music
of such seductive melody as this:
"Love comes in youth, and in the
wakeful heart
Delight begins, soft as Aurora's
breath,
Fretting the silver waves, and dimly
sweet
As stir of birds in branches of the
dawn.
So soft, so sweet, thy touches round
my heart.
O fable, fable on."
If one would truly love, one must
not be too old of heart. Experience
ties one's fancies down. It is only when
we are young that love can make for
us "the face of nature radiant with a
purple light; the morning and the night
varied enchantments." So soon we find
ourselves meeting the world with dull
philosophy. We have seen too many
morns and evenings flush and fade.
But at least we can try not to forget
what love meant when first it came,
as fair as she whom Homer called "the
rosy-fingered daughter of the dawn."
O love, thy coming woke the waiting
day,
The dawn broke into glory at thy
voice,
And bade the birds within my
heart rejoice
Like those that welcome waking
morns of May.

GRACE'S
CAPTURE
James Harrigan
CLYDE PHILLIPS emptied his re
volver at his pursuers and tore
madly down the road. Presently
he reined in his horse and turned
to look Into the twin barrels of a shot
gun.
Further along the gun waa a decid
edly pretty face, which bore a look of
stern determination. Instinctively his
hands went up.
"That's better," said a girlish voice.
"What Is this?" he asked,
"a hold-up?"
I "Now throw those guns into the road."
"What is this?" he asked laughingly;
! "a hold-up?"
"You ought to know," she said terse
j ly, "you started it. Drop those guns
; quick"
"Evidently you are a volunteer," he
! said easily. "You don't have to play
the game like that. Those guns of mine
! are only loaded with blanks."
The girl laughed scornfully.
"But you dropped those poor men out
|of the saddle," she said meaningly,
i "You throw those guns down or I'll fill
' you full of buckshot."
With a laugh he tossed the pistols
. Into the road. The girl rode up and
j with the rope at.her saddle bow bound
| his hands together, bringing the arms
1 down. Then, dismounting, she utilized
i the rest of the rope to bind his feet to
j gether under the horse's body.
"Look here," said Phillips, uneasily,
j "What is this?"
"It means the game's up," she an
; swered. "I saw your description In the
I county papers two weeks ago. There's
j a reward of $10,000 up for you."
"Whom do you mistake me for?" he
j asked anxiously. "There is no reward
offered for me, and if you think to hold
me for ransom you make a grievous er
ror."
"There's no mistake," she said short
i ly. "I saw the report of your hold-up
: six weeks ago. Then came the offer of
reward and your description, and now
: I just saw you tumble three deputies
| into the road. I watched a chance to
, get in behind you. What did you stop
Iso suddenly for?"
"I was going back," he explained,
j "I'm the head of a motion picture ex
j pedition. We are down here taking a
; series of pictures of the hold-up of the
'â  paymaster's train by Butte Bill last
I week. I was playing the desperado,
; escaping from the posse sent to capture
him. As soon as I was out of range I
I started to go back to the party and
i found you."
"Quite a surprise, wasn't it?"
I "It was," he admitted frankly, "but
I it's something that can be easily ex
plained. If you will just lead me back
|to the party It will all turn out right."
j With scorn playing about a decidedly
! pretty mouth, she remounted her own
horse and catching the bridle of his
! turned the horses' heads down the road.
Phillips tried to argue, but to all en
â  treaties she was deaf, and finally he
kept silence and let her 1 lead him along
| the dusty trail, cursing the fate that
1 had led him beyond sight of his co
workers.
An hour passed before the trail led
I them from the foothills out upon the
prairie, and every foot of the way was
agony to Phillips, whose bonds cut with
every motion of the horse.
"Would you mind loosening these
ropes a little?" he asked finally. "You
see. we city men are not as used to the
saddle as you are out here."
The girl looked back coldly. "I guess
you can stand It for a while," she said
shortly. "I'm not going to take chances
with you. You're no city man."
"If you will feel in my coat pocket," I
he urged, "you will find papers that
Will prove my identity."
He spoke so earnestly that, half-con- !
vinced. she let her horse drop back and
slipped her hand first into the outside
then into the inside pockets. Ther,e was
not a shred of paper.
"What are you up to?" she asked '
sharply. "Did you think you could
reach my gun?"
"I had forgotten," he said shame- 1
facedly, "I changed to a costume and i
every scrap of paper is in my other i
clothes.."
"It will be a long time before you !
see those," she retorted grimly, "un
less you peach and tell where the gang
holds out."
"The Star Theater, Chicago, is
where my gang holds out." he laugh
ed. "If you ever come to Chicago I
should be pleased to extend to you all
the courtesies of the houseâfree
tickets, you know."
"Better wait until you get there,"
she cautioned. "If the boys get at you
before the Sheriff doesâ" she felt the
sentence unfinished, but there was no i
need of explanation.
"Where are we headed for?" he
asked after a silence, more to break
the solitude than anything else.
"To the shack first, for dinner," she
answered, "then fresh horses and by
the long route to Tulpas City."
"Why not the shorter way?" he
pleaded.
"And maybe run into your gang!
No, sir!" she retorted with emphasis.
"I've worked like a slave for my little
homestead. Sister and I have a quar
ter section each and we live together
where the two tracts join. We need
sbme money to get irrigation, and I'm
not going to take any risks of losing
you."
After that Phillips was silent, until
they came in sight of a small shack
.in the doorway of which stood a blue
clad figure. This he found was the
sister, and after he had dismounted
(with a pistol Inconveniently near his
ear) she it was who led the horses to
the stable while the other took him
inside and tied his legs to a chair.
They would not untie his hands

MISS KRUPP'S WEALTH
The statement has frequently ap
peared in the press that Fraulein Ber
tha Krupp, who inherited the big
Krupp iron works at Essen, Germany,
is the'richest woman in the world, but
the exact amount of her wealth has
usually been left to the reader's imag
ination. Information, however, regard
ing the amount of her annual income,
from one source, at least, has lately
been made public. The capital stock
of the Krupp Company is $40,000,000.
and most of this is the property of
Fraulein Krupp. Recently the com
pany declared a dividend of 6 per cent,
the total sum thus distributed being
$2,400,000, nearly all of which went to
the Fraulein herself. Doubtless she
also has other Investments which
serve to swell her yearly profits. Thus,
while her income does not compare
with that of some business magnates
in this country, it is sufficient to make
her a highly eligible catch in the es
timation of the aristocrats and prince
lings of the Old World. She is, how
ever, credited with being a sensible
business woman, who knows how to
take care of her riches and to use them
to better advantage than in mere os
tentation and pomp. She is accom
plished and benevolent, and Is said to
be in high favor with the Emperor and

â¢ NEW YORK, Jan. 3â Developments of OT
exf*cted Importance confronted the stock mar
ket for its interpretation Tilth the opening of
the new year's business this morning. The.:
fair 01" Port' Arthur and the decision In the
. Northern Securities injunction suit have long
been awaited as events of prime importance by
those operating in stocks. The moderate effect
to-day is easily explainable from the very fact
that these events were long anticipated. There
was some rather wide fluctuation during the
morning, but the moderate proportions of the
dealings warned those sharing In them that
they were not in a large company and the
marks* settled,down toward the latter part of
â¢ , lay to a rather dull tons and with the
ac.-anees indifferently held. There was some
(Msposition to attribute this effect to a third
widely expected event, namely, the resump
tion of the campaign by published advertise
ments against the prices of stocks. There was
not, in fact, any very powerful palpable evi
dence of the dire effects threatened for the
market by this morning's proclamation. But
it is not improbable that there was some
dread of the occurrences of such events, which
had its part in deterring operators from active
dealings.
The sudden rise In Amalgamated Copper,
with evidence of some confusion among the
shorts In the stock, was the motive of a
rally late in the day which made the closing
strong.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Jan. 3.âThe greatest strength of
the wheat market was at tho Immediate open
ing. Initial quotations on May delivery
showed a gain of %@%c at $1 15 to $1 15%.
The principal source of strength lay In the
weekly statistics. The domestic situation also
was construed ac favorable to the bulls, the
arrivals in the Northwest being much smaller
than those of last week.
Later In the day a rumor that the visible
supply had Increased nearly three million
1 bushels caused a decided commotion in the pit.
; For a time offerings were much in excess of
the demand. The result was a sharp break In
! prices. May dropped to $1 18%. Official flg
j urea, however, failed to donfirm the sensational
report, the increase being estimated at only
' 001,000 buÃhels. The market recovered a por
| tlon of the loss in consequence of fair buying
j brought out by the more bullish aspect of the
1 statistics and closed easy with May oft %c
lat SI 14.
In consequence of the bearish character of
i weekly statistics the corn market exhibited
j considerable weakness. Ma!y cloeed %Â®%c
1 down at 44% c.
The decline in corn had a depressing effect
jon the oats market. May closed at 31%@31%c.
Considering a decline of 10c In the price of
i hogs, the provision market waa firm. May
! pork cloeed unchanged, lard unchanged and
ribs a shade lower.

WHEAT FREIGHTS âThe new year opens
v.ith the freight market In very poor condition
for shipowners. The combination of European
has failed to maintain Its rates of 22s
(id fixed months ago, and the present quota
tions are 15s from this port and 20s from the
north and even these low rates are nominal, aa
there Is no business at them. Meanwhile
many of ihe disengaged fleet have left port
seeking business elsewhere, so it will be seen
that the freight market is in a demoralized
condition. The chartered wlrat fleet In port
has a registered tonnage cf 10,406, against 10,
--570 tous on the same date last year; dlsen
gagef!, 38,650 tons, against 1)5,000; on the way
to this port, 176,924 tons, against 194,300.

Indian, 337,000; Australian, 61,000.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potata market was quite active and
firm for the Best Bur* nks, as retailers were
replenishing their stocks, which had become
depleted during the holidays. There were
heavy arrivals from the river districts and the
lower grades were dragging again. The mar-
Jcet was still overstocked with Onions and
prices had another decline.
Receipts of southern vegetables were very
light, as usual on Tuesday, but there was
plenty of carried-over stock available at about
previous prices. Tomatoes have been arriving
freely of late and there is quite an accumu
lation in secelvers' hands.

Poultry and Game.
The market for live Poultry was in good
shape, large chickens particularly being in de
mand, and. as receipts from domestic shipping
points were light, available supplies were
quickly cleaned up. Three cars of Western

more will be available to-day. Gams was
w-eak, as there were practically two days' re

Butter. Cheese and Eggs.
The market opened dull and unsatisfactory
aftei the holidays, with plenty of Butter and
Eggs on hand, and the feeling in both was
easy, though there waa no actual declln-.
Some houses were still cutting quotations on
Eggs, as they did during the closing days of
last week, while others still quoted 40c. It Is
not expected, however, that this price will
continue very long, as this Is the time of the
year for the market to drop with the rapid
Increase in the production. Cheese remains the

offered for sale. Yesterday's trade in Or
anges was of small volume, despite the warm,
sunny weather, as retailers were holding off,
awaiting the outcome of the auction. The
other Citrus fruits were in ample supply and
quiet at the old quotations. The Apple mar
ket had a. healthy tone, with trade quite
active, and some withdrawals from cold stor
age were reported. A few chests of poor

STOCK MARKET.
Continued Activity in Mining Stocks,
the Others Dull.
The Stock and Bond Exchange opened busi
ness after the holidays in its fine new quarters
in the new Merchants' Exchange building, but
did not do the business that the occasion
might seem to warrant, for trading was very
light and the only change worthy of note was
a decline In Spring Valley Water to $38 87%.
The Comstock mining shares continued ex
cited and feverish, with a further advance In
Ophir to $0 at the very opening. The stock
failed to hold the rise, however, and fell back
steadily all day, getting down to 87 60 In the
afternoon, closing at $7 75 bid. The other
Comstocks sympathized with the movements
of the leader, as will be seen.
Con. California and Virginia Mining Com
pany has levied an assessment of 25c.
The Tonopah stocks were fairly active, with
MaeXamara higher ut 30@32c. The oil stocks
were quiet.

ty, in the year 1902, gave judgments
against the State in some forty-six
suitsâthe aggregate amount of the
judgments being $212,720. At its last
session the Legislature appropriated
the sum of $204,610 to pay these judg
ments, the appropriations to be avail
able January 1, 1906, provided that, at
that time, the judgments should be
c landing, not reversed or vacated, and
that no appeal should be pending.
The acts of appropriation passed by
the Legislature in this form appeared
to contemplate appeals to the Supreme
Court, and I concurred in the opinion
that the State should exercise its privi
lege of appeal, as any private individ
ual would be likely to do. The appeal
was taken, and was prosecuted to final
judgment, stipulations being entered
that the other cases should stand or
fall with the appealed case. On Sep
tember 19, 1904, the Supreme Court
affirmed the judgment of the Superior
Court in the case of Bickerdike vs.
State, and in pursuance of the stipu
lation Judgments in the other cases be
came final. As the appropriations were
unavailable until January 1, 1905, the
claimants suffered no delay in payment
by reason of the appeals being taken.
The Judgments which no appropria
tions were made to pay were for the
following persons and amounts:
lAbe Darlington $165
John F. Pry or 3350
C. A. Weaver Sift
L C. Walte 410

For a number of years the expense
of arresting criminals without the
State and returning them for trial has
been increasing, while the appropria
tions have remained the same, being
made at the rate of $2500 per year.
The consequence has been the incur
ring of deficiencies, which recently
have tended to equal or exceed the
amount of appropriations.
I have endeavored to impress upon
District Attorneys the advisability of
refraining from making applications
for extradition, except in cases of seri
cus crimes, and upon Sheriffs and po
lice officers, acting as State agents, the
necessity of rigid economy in their ex
pense accounts. In cases which ap
peared unimportant I have refused to
issue requisitions, and, in a few in
stances, I have issued requisitions only
upon the condition that the arrest and
return of the fugitive should be with
out expense to the State.
At the same time It would be an
encouragement to crime and to crimi
nals not to send for murderers, forgers
end embezzlers who flee to other
States, and the expense of doing this
Is properly a public one, which indi
viduals or corporations cannot be* ex
pected to assume. 1 respectfuly rec
ommend that the appropriation made
for this purpose be increased to $10,000
for the next two years.
One of the business practices of the
State which is of questionable ex
pediency is the refusal to insure its
property (with some exceptions)
against loss by fire. Because in for
mer years abuses were discovered In
connection with the placing of poll
cifF, the Legislature passed an act pro
hibiting insurance and it has remained
the law for fourteen years. Moreover,
the biennial appropriation bill usually
contains a prohibition against the ex
penditure of any money to buy insur
ance.
Since the enactment of the law of
IS9I the State has been fortunate in
escaping any very heavy losses by Are,
but buildings have burned and there
have been a number of narrow escapes
from the destruction of some of the
most expensive structures. During the
past year one of the buildings of the
Preston School of Industry was
burned, causing considerable incon
venience, and if one of the larger and
more costly State buildings, say one
of the hospitals for the insane, should
suddenly be swept away, the lack of
Insurance would make rebuilding a
serious problem.
Whether it be wise to continue the
prohibition of insurance is a question
the Legislature might profitably con
sider; but should the prohibition be
removed, it would be well to require
the assent of the State Board of Ex
aminers to each insurance policy ac
cepted. %
It may be that the conditions are
s such as to justify the State in carry
ins its own risks; but, at least, there
should be some provision made to meet
sudden calls for funds to make good
losses sustained through fire. To that
end, I recommend the establishment of
an insurance fund to be made up of a
moderate sum set apart from the pro
ceeds of taxation each year. The State
Board of Examiners might be author
ized to Invest this fund in the same
class of securities in which the per
, manent school fund is invested, and
also to sell these securities and apply
the money to rebuilding when fires oc
cur during a recess of the Legislature.
WOEK OF STATE
JUUED OF CHAEITIES
AND COEEECTIONS
The State Board of Charities and
Corrections, which was created by the
last Legislature, and given investiga
tive and advisory authority, entered
upon the discharge of its duties
eighteen months ago. The members
accepted the theory, as stated in their
report, that their relations toward the
various State institutions should be
those of assistance and co-operation,
rather than of criticism, and such
shortcomings as they have discovered
they attibute to inadequate facilities or
other unpropltious conditions more
than to the remissness of boards of di
rectors or officers. A number of im
portant recommendations for the im
provement of the prisons and the
Whlttier and Preston schools have been
made and may be found in their bien
nial report.
All of the county jails have been in
spected by members of the board, and
the discovery Is reported that in many
counties of the State laws with respect
to separate rooms for the confinement
of different classes of prisoners, of
c hildren and adults, and of men and
women, are being violated. On the
other hand, the county hospitals,
which also have been visited, are
found to be in better shape and gener
ally serve very well the purpose for
which they were created, although
these hospitals are not all equally
good, and in many there is much room
for improvement.
A census of the inmates of jails, hos
pitals, and infirmaries was made Janu
ary 1, 1904, and another July 1 of the
same year. It was found that at the
date first mentioned the jails contained
1686 persons, while six months later the
number had been reduced to 1256. This
marked difference between the winter
population of the jails, and that of the
summer, emphasizes the conclusion an
nounced by the board that some form
of work ought to be found for county
jail prisoners.
Of unfortunates condemned by pov
erty or old age and slokness to be
inmates of hospitals and infirmaries
there are no less than 4042 in the State,
and they are divided between cus
todial and hospital cases in about the
proportion of two to one.
In the report of the Secretary of
State attention is called to the neces
sity for making an appropriation which
will render it possible to execute some
of the needed repairs to the State
Capitol. This is a noble building, and
a great credit to earlier generations of
Californians, but In its plumbing and
heating systems it is Sadly antiquated,
besides being out of repair in a good
many ways. The report of the State
Board of Health declares the present
condition of the building dangerous to
the health of its inmates.
I wish also to indorse the suggestion
of the Secretary of State that better
facilities for the keeping and proper
arrangement of the archives are
urgently needed.
In the biennial report presented by
the Commissioner of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics will be found indus
trial and social data of a good deal of
interest. It is shown, on the evidence
of the figures of the last census, that
the number of the unemployed is
smaller in this State than the average
in the country at large. In the cities
there has been during the past several
years a general shortening of the work
ing day for mechanics and several
other classes of employes, with an in
crease in pay. The number of women
and children who are breadwinners is
increasing in California as well as else
where, although the proportion of this
class of workers Is smaller . than in
other parts of the country. Labor
organizations have Increased rapidly
during the last two years, and include
now more than eight hundred unions,
whose membership is estimated to be
over 100.000.
A special report on workingmen and
university education shows that the
number of students in the University
of California who are sons or daugh
ters of wage-earners is large and that
these students make a fine showing;
they comprise 20 per cent of the in
trants, 26 per cent of the graduates and
32 per cent of the honor men.
I recommend that the scope of the
statistical work done by this bureau be
enlarged sufficiently to enable it to col
lect statistics of marriage and divorce
and also of crimes, which could be ac
complished at small expense, by requir
ing the co-operation of county and city
officers.
I am glad to be able to say that the
new horticultural commission law,
which received my approyal March 25,
1903, has proven effective for the pur
poses intended, and, with some possible
additions of power and resource, bids
fair to continue to meet all reasonable
requirements.
Perhaps the most important horticul
tural fact yet brought to light is that
predaceous Insects, while in their na
tive habitat and attended by their nat
ural adversaries, are never or seldom
so injurious to plant life as to make
any form of husbandry unprofitable. It
is only when one Insect is imported
without the company of its natural
enemy that the balance of nature is
disturbed and injury inflicted upon ag
ricultural and horticultural production.
To such advantage has this fact been
employed in California, and mainly
through the assiduous efforts of the
State horticultural offlce, that the once
dreaded San Jose scale Is now rtndered
almost powerless for evil, and the va
rious forms of orange scale are fast
disappearing from the orchards. It is
a reasonable estimate that the Scutel
lista cyanea, which is cleaning the
trees of black scale, has proven Itself
worth a round million dollars to our
commonwealth, and It is hardly too
much to say that the Vedalia cardinalis
rescued the great citrus fruit industry
from imminent danger of destruction
through the cottony cushion scale.
EFFOETS TO KEEP
THE CODLING MOTH
OUT OF OECHAEDS
Through an arrangement effected by
the Horticultural Commissioner with
the Government of West Australia,
George Compere, the entomologist, was
sent, during the past year, upon an ex
tended Journey in South America, Eu
rop and Asia Minor, at the Joint ex
pense of these two states. His princi
pal mission, so far as this State is con
cerned, was to discover a parasite of
the codling moth, an insect so destruc
tive that it has been estimated it takes
annually 40 per cent of the pear and
apple crops. Mr. Compere thinks he
has found parasites which will destroy
the codling moth, and he has sent to
Commissioner Ellwood Cooper colonies
of these insects, which are now being
bred and will be placed in the orchards
next season. If the results hoped for
are secured, every /dollar expended in
this enterprise will be returned a thou
sand-fold.
The citrus Industry being now men
aced by the threatened introduction
of the Morelos orange maggot, which
infests the orange growing districts of
Mexico, the Importation of the fruit
from that country has been prohibit
ed. But since this does not entirely
remove the danger that the pest may
be brought in, it is proposed that Cal
ifornia shall co-operate with Mexico
with a view to discovering some
means of combating the insect in the
Mexican orchards.
An industry that has added to the
wealth of the State an aggregate value
of $418,861,853 in seventeen years
should not lose its proper place in the
consideration of the people of the
commonwealth or the Legislature
which represents them. California is
not only rich in precious metals, but
in other mineral products of equal If
not greater value and our State is so
rich in all these that the exploitation
of them thus far has, with the excep
tion of placer mining, left them com
paratively untouched. With the com
pletion of the new mining building at
the State University it is to be hoped
that more young men of spirit and en
terprise will have their attention at
tracted to mining as a life work and
to California as a proper field for the
exercise of their powers, however
great they may prove to be. There
are hard problems still to solve, but
it cannot be doubted that ways will
be found for extracting the precious

The State Controller has submitted i
the recommendation that a certain I
sum shall be appropriated and placed
Rt the disposal of the Skate Board of
Examiners to be expendeu in printing !
the reports of boards, commissions
and officers whose publication has not
been otherwise provided for. It ap
pears to be necessary either to do this,
or to make separate appropriations
for general printing and for publica
tion of reports for the boards and of
ficers referred to, since under the ex
isting conditions some of them are
unable to have their reports printed
in the State printing offlce until de
ficiency appropriations have been
made for them. It would be most un
wise, however, to go back to the old
practice of making a lump sum ap
propriation for all Scate printing, be
cause the present plan of making sep
arate appropriations for each offlce,
as recommended by Governors Budd
and Gage, has proved to be much
more economical.
One of the matters of greatest mag
nitude which the Legislature will be i
called upon to consider is that of con
trol of the floods of the Sacramento j
River and its tributaries and the rec*
lamation of the basin lands. Fully
twenty millions of money, public and
private, have already been expended
to accomplish this object, but the re- !
suits have been unsatisfactory, and in
recent years the opinion has been
growing that the solution of the prob
lem could be found only in a compre
hensive system of channel develop
ment and bank protection, such as is
beyond the power of accomplishment
by land owners acting individually or
through local district organizations.
The previously gradual development
of this sentiment received a great im
petus from the disasters of last spring,
when river floods occurred which in
flicted a damage amounting to sev
eral millions of dollars and demon
strated the need of a unified public
control of the levee system.
Almost before the full extent of the
damage had been ascertained, the
owners of river lands, manifesting
their usual indomitable spirit, held a
convention, formed an association and
enlisted the co-operation of the com
mercial organizations. Out of* this
movement there eventually came the
employment by the Commissioner of
Public Works of three eminent engi
neers, Messrs. T. G. Dabney of Mis
sissippi, H. B. Richardson of Louisiana
and H. M. Chittenden of the United
States army, who, with Mr. M. A.
Nurse, were constituted a board to
study the whole problem, and report a
plan of relief. The report, which has
recently been submitted, Is an able,
document, and shows great boldness
in its conception of, a system of con
trol of the rivers.
In its analysis of the causes of the
floods the report demonstrates that
the immediate cause, though not the
primary one. is the Inadequacy of the
channel of the middle and lower rivet
to carry off the floods poured in from
above and from both sides. The most
striking proof offered of this Is the
fact that at Iron Canyon, near Red
Bluff, the channel capacity of the river
is equal to 200,000 cubic feet per secy
ond, while at Collinsville, near its
mouth, the maximum flood flow iÂ»
but 166,000 cubic feet. The primary
cause of the channel conditions be
fore mentioned is, of course, the to
pography of the valley which from
Stony Creek down to Sulsun Bay offers
such a very gradual descent that the
river, unaided by sufficient levees, doe*
not cut a deep channel, as it does,
nearer its source. In times of high
floods the channel from Stony Creek
southward has always been insuffi
cient to carry all of the water, and in
recent times there has been a serious
channel deterioration from the mouth
of Feather River to the bay. At all
times the river, in flood periods, has
relieved itself of surplus waters by dis
charging them over the banks, or
through sloughs, Into the depressed
areas, called basins, by which it is
bounded on both sides.
PLANS TO PEEVENT
FLOODS IN THE
VALLEYS OF STATE
The basic principle of the plan of re
lief suggested Is concentration in order
that channel improvement may be se
cured, and the means by which con
centration is to be obtained consist in
large part of levee construction. Not
only is the Sacramento River through
out its course from Stony Creek to Col
linsville to be leveed, but also the
Feather, Yuba, Bear and American riv
ers and other tributaries are to be so
treated. Even the small creeks are to
be lined with levees, and the hill drain
age is to be collected and carried off in
canals. Through the great basins there
are to extend waterways for drainage,
and during .the period when the channel
improvement is being effected these
waterways will operate as by-passes to
receive and carry away the spill from
the river. An essential feature of the
project is cutting off bends and
straightening the river between the
mouth of the Feather and the city of
Colusa, it being proposed to reduce the
present length of this part of the
stream, which is almost seventy miles,
to forty-seven miles. In order to In
crease the scour of the river in its low
er reaches It is proposed to close the
sloughs through which a part of the
discharge now enters the San Joaquin.
To make this safe there must first be
created below Rio Vista a channel ca
pacity of 250,000 second feet.
Such are the general outlines of the
plan of relief now proposed, which in
its main features agrees fairly well with
the conclusions reached by other com
missions and engineers. The members
of the present commission testify to the
value of the work performed by their
predecessors, and admit that without
the data previously collected they
could not have prepared this report.
They add that before the details of the
project now submitted can be worked
out it will be necessary to make many
new surveys and arrive at accurate de
terminations concerning a number of
minor problems.
The estimate of cost, made on a lib
eral basis, is $23,776,022. While this is a
very large amount of money, the ad
vantages to be derived from the suc
cessful execution of the enterprise
would be so vast that the price to be
paid Is relatively small. In times of ex
treme flood 1700 square miles, or more
than 1,000,000 acres, of fertile lands are
flooded, and of this area 750,000 acres
now have comparatively small values
because they cannot be safely cultl
HENEY BITTER
AGAINST GEARY
Counsel for Mrs. Wickersham
Scores the Ex-Congressman
in His Closing Argument
Judge Seawell yesterday devoted the
day to hearing the arguments on both
sides of the Wickersham will case.
Francis J. Heney opened and closed for
Cora Wiskersham, widow of Frank
Wickersham, the Fresno politician and
ranchman, who sold his expectancy in
the estate of his mother for $28,000.
The widow seeks to set aside the sale
and to get a larger share of the estate.
Attorneys T. J. Geary and J. C. Camp
bell defended the interests of the elder
Mrs. Wickersham's children.
Mr. Heney was particularly severe
upon ex-Congressman Geary and sug
gested that the latter should have been
disbarred for his actions in connection
with the Inducement of Frank Wick
ersham to dispose of his interests to
his brother and sisters. It was charged
that Geary had told Frank that his
mother had cut him off in her will and
this was used as a club to compel him
to enter into the agreement with
his brother, Fred. Mr. Heney said that
he would not insist that Frank Wick
ersham was of weak mind, but in this
transaction his necessities were known
by those who took advantage of them
to force him to a settlement, and he
was beaten out of money he should
have had.
Geary, in his argument, said that
there was no fraud when a man enters
into a contract for his own benefit, as
Frank did, and whatever secret agree
ment there may have been between
Fred and his sisters could not affect
Frank's actions. As to Frank's mental
incompetency, formerly pleaded, Geary
said that it only consisted in overin
dulgence in liquor and that when sober
he was a shrewd business man. It had
not been shown that he was not sober
when he signed the contract.
Attorney Campbell said that the sole
point was whether or rrot there had
been any fraud in getting Frank's sig
nature and declared that there had
been no affirmative statement made to
Frank which was fraudulent, to cause
him to sign the agreement to settle.
Mr. Campbell eloquently described
Mrs. Wickersham's reasons for cutting
her son from her bounty. He had an
nounced his intention of contesting his
father's will, charging him with un
soundness of mind and with being un
der the fraudulent influence of his
other children. This had so shocked
the sensitive mother that she declared
he should have none of her fortune. Mr.
Campbell asserted that Frank had re
ceived nearly his share in the combined
estates of his father and mother, the
deceased banker having advanced his
son $100,000 during his lifetime and he
received $46,000 additional in the settle
ment with his brother, mother and sis
ters. The two'estates were "worth more
than $700,000. The lawyer said that the
son, in selling his expectancy, had
merely given a promise of peace to the
aged mother and permitted her to dis
pose of her property as she saw fit.
The case was subrpitted.

nedy, a waiter, who were arrested
on Monday by Detective Ryan, were
booked at the City Prison yesterday
on a charge of grand larceny. The
complaint was sworn to before Po
lice Judge Fritz by W. A. Williams
of Williams, Ariz., who alleges that
while he was suffering from drugged
liquor on Sunday night the defendants
extracted a pocketbook from his
pocket containing $1400 In currency
and $80 in gold. He had Bpent $23
in drinks for the woman and waiter.
The woman was released on $1500
cash bail.
Vickery Charged With Forgery.
B. C. Vickery was booked at the
City Prison yesterday on a charge of
forgery. The complaining witness is
Joseph C. Herold, manager of a shoe
store at 812 Market street, who al
leges that Vickery on December 24
passed a check for $27 50 on him
purporting to bear the signature of
Charles Emerson, a former employer
of Vickery. Emerson says his signa..
ture was a forgery. Vickery was ar
rested a few dqys ago for passing a
fictitious check on Chester B. Ellis,
a stockbroker.
vated. If absolutely protected from
floods this area would be made worth,
at a conservative valuation, from $50,
--000,000 to $75,000,000, and an additional
"area of 250,000 acres, now protected
against ordinary floods, would be large
ly enhanced In value. Therefore the
permanent reclamation of this vast ex
tent of overflowed lands, assuming It
could be accomplished at an expense of
$24,000,000, would be the most profitable
kind of business undertaking. It would
create a great amount of new wealth,
add to the productive power of the
State and cause a large increase In
population.
To accomplish these grand results
seems to require the co-operation of
the State and United States govern
ments, combined with a large degree
of public spirit and private enterprise
on the part of the individuals who will
be most directly affected. Such exten
sive changes in the regimen of the
Sacramento River as are proposed may
not be made except the assent of the
United States Government is first se
cured and presumably that will not be
given until the whole project has first
been reviewed and approved by a board
of Federal engineers organized for the
purpose. It would, therefore, be well,
I think, for the Legislature to take ac
tion looking to the appointment, by the
proper authority, of such a board,
which would naturally be composed of
eminent engineers, whose conclusions
would constitute a valuable check upon
the work of the State's commission.
If the theories and estimates of the lat
ter should be sustained and verified,
there would be added confidence felt in
the practicability of the enterprise on
the lines which have been laid down.
At the same time, such a Federal com
mission would lay the foundation on
which an appeal could be made to Con
gress for aid in executing the work.
The benefits which the State will de
rive from the improvement of the river
and the reclamation square
miles of fertile land are so great that
it will be sound public policy for it to
assist In every way in which it can do
so. But in what manner it can best
act is a question calling for thorough
and intelligent consideration before a
decision Is reached. The loan of the
State's credit to assist the work of a
great reclamation district, as well as a
liberal appropriation of money to aid
in the river improvement, has been
suggested, but I feel that the subject
has not yet been sufficiently discussed
to render It possible to make a positive
recommendation. But in view of the
vast amount of new wealth which will
be created, the land itself will naturally
be called upon to assume a burden of
expense and, so far as possible. In just
proportion to the Increment of values.
STORE ENTERED BY BURGLARS.âOak
land, Jan. 3.âC. Gargulla's store, 906 East
j Twenty-fifth street, was entered last night by
1 burglars, who stole $23 and a blanket.
WILL REAPPOINT
FIFE OFFICIALS
Mayor Schmitz Makes An
nouncement That Incum
bents Will Be Eetained
Mayor Schmitz made the definite an
nouncement yesterday that he will re
appoint at least five Commissioners
whose terms of offlce will expire on
January 8 next. This confirms the pre
liminary advices already published in
The Call that such would be the case.
Those who will be reappointed accord
ing to the Mayor's statement are as
follows:
School Director âAeron Altmann.
Member of the Board of HealthâDr.
Joseph F! Poheim.
Fire CommissionerâHenry M. Wre
den.
Election Commissioner âA. W. Voor
sanger.
Civil Service CommissionerâJohn
W. Rogers.
This leaves only three commissionsr
ships to be filled, but his Honor stat
ed that he will not announce his selec
tions thereon until the latter part of
this week. David J. Oliver, who
thought he would be appointed Civil
Service Commissioner, will have to wait
until Rogers resigns to accept some
Federal position.
The fact that Dr. Poheim will remain
on the Health Board kills his aspira
tions to succeed Howell as Police Com
missioner. Who the latter** successor
will be the Mayor alone knows and
he will not tell. Gossip mentions Dr.
George Drucker, Arthur Dudley Cross
and G. M. Roy as probable appointees.
Thomas F. Egan still appears to
have the best chance to succeed M.
Casey, who will retire from public life.
The Call's announcement that Casey
would not succeed himself brought
numerous strong influences to bear up
on the Mayor to change his mind, but
thus far without Buccess. For Park
Commissioner William H. Metson ap
pears to have as good a chance as any
one else for reappointment.
Alexander O'Grady, an attorney, is
slated for appointment as secretary of
the Police Commission to succeed Cad
walader. Should Egan be put on the
Board of Works John G. Fitzgerald
will in all likelihood succeed him as
storekeeper of the Board of Education.
