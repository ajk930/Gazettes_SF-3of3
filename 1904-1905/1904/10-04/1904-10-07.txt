WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.â One of the
most important of the recommenda

at the coming session will be included
in the report of the Commissioner Gen
eral of Immigration. It has long been
the belief of Sargent that the immi
grants landing at the great ports of
this country, particularly New York,
should be encouraged to make their
way into tbe West and South, instead
of remaining in the cities. The "West
n-eds immigrants to till Its soil and
the South is at a great disadvantage
for lack of the proper sort of labor.
Italians, Poles, Austro-Hungarlans,
Russians and similar classes prefer to
remain in the cities. Xew York, Chi
cago, Philadelphia, Boston and other
great cities are overcrowded with them
and they are not generally considered
valuable citizens.
Just what Congress might do to di
vert the tfde is not stated, but the
Commissioner is of the opinion that
inducements could be offered to new
comers to work the desired end.

ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 6.âCon
trary to general expectations, the rep
resentations submitted to Russia by
the United States for the recognition,
without discrimination, of American
passports have not been entirely
fruitless. Foreign Minister Lams
dorff's response, communicated to Em
bassador McCormlck to-day, even cre
ates the hope that something may act
ually be accomplished. After receiv
ing consideration at the Foreign Office,
the American note was referred to
the High Commission for General Re
vision of Passport Laws, which was
created by imperial ukase in December,
1503. All matters relating to pass
ports and the exclusion of the Jews
are governed by the international laws
of the empire, and the question Is out
side of the direct field of diplomatic
negotiation.
By referring the representations of
the United States, compliance with
which would involve a modification of
the passport laws, to the commission,
which body is competent to act there
upon, a decistpn of the question may
be direct!? rrÂ»iv-tÂ«cL^ AlP.^fBctÂ»l "orTft*"
Foreign OfRcA J has been appointed by
Count Lamsdorff to sit with the com
mission, thus insuring consideration of
the international aspect of the question.
Moreover, the commission will sit
under the direction of the Minister of
the Interior, and Kmbassador McCor
mick, who had an extended talk with
Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky. the Minister
of the Interior, upon the subject this
evening, found him. as might have been
expected from his recent public utter
ances, quite sympathetic. Indeed,
there is reason to believe that the
plan to refer the subject to the com
mission was previously arranged at a
conference between Count Lamsdorff
and Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky.
Considering that .this is the first time
the Russian authorities have not de
clined to entertain American represen
tations upon this question, the present
response to Embassador McCormick
may be regarded as another signal
proof of Russia's desire for friendly
relations with the United States.

session of Congress which closed in April I
spoke and worked for legislation designed to
restore our vanishing flag to the Seven Seas.
When the merchant marine commission bill
was under consideration in the House of Rep
resentatives I offered an amendment requiring
that in addition to the proposed inquiry affect
ing ships the Marine Commission should In
quire into the conditions affecting seamen.
The amendment was adopted, and it was in
pursuance of that amendment that the Marine
Comminslon when in San Francisco recently
took evidence as to sailors, stokers and others
employed on ships. Evidence of the same sort
has been taken by the commission wherever it
has held hearings, and when Congress reas
sembles in December this evidence will be
laid before it and be made the basis for action
of some sort on behalf of seamen.
Desiring that ships, of American register
should carry cur trade with the Philippines,
and knowing of the large idle American ton
nage in this country, and especially in this
port. I urged in AVasnington that there should
be no deiay whatever in making the coast
wise navigation laws of the United States ap
plicable to the Philippines.
Continuing, Mr. Livernash said that
with the Idea, of advancing the Ameri
can merchant marine . he stood in
Congress for making the coastwise
laws immediately effective in the case
of the Philippines, rather than five
years from 1904, as some proposed, or
two years from 1904, as others de
sired, and that when the choice was
between deferring until 1906 or defer
ring until 1909, he was one of the
three Democrats that aided In pre
venting the adoption of the 1909 limit
by the House. Mr. Livernash also said
that he, SDOke and voted in Congress
for continuing the mall pay for Amer
ican ships, which had enabled. lines to
maintain superior service between this
and certain ' foreign" ports. .
; In conclusion he * cbinted to his
labors In â¢Congress to put an end to
the practice of employing on Ameri
can ships Chinese not entitled to en
ter the United States. Mr. Livernash
will deliver other speeches to work
ingmen during the noon hour
throughout the campaign.
Timothy Spellacy, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee,
visited headquarters last evening and
took note of the progress of the
campaign. Spellacy still maintains
that he sees a chance for his party
in California in November, but just
yet he Is not quoting'flgures. He says
the Democratic campaign will liven
up in a few days and then the people
will be supplied with reasons why
they should support Parker and Da

Probe Frauds, But Take No Action.
â¢.-Indictments Found Against -Al

Two indictments we're returned by

ELKO. Oct. 6. â At Elko early
this morning Senator Fairbanks made
his first speech of the day and the
only speech he will make until he
reaches Ogden, where he will speak
to-night. He spoke from the rear
platform of the "Edgemere" and, early
as was the hour, had a large audience.
Senator Fairbanks addressed him
self largely to Democrats, contending
that Republican policies are better
calculated than Democratic policies to
protect their interests. Speaking to
the wool growers, many of whom re
side in this comumnity, he asked them
if they were not more prosperous un
der the present tariff law than they
had been under the Wilson-Gorman
law, by which wool had been put on
the free list. Some one in the crowd
responded in the affirmative.
The Senator spoke also of President
Roosevelt, declaring that not since the
time of Washington had there been a
President who had better administered
the affairs of the country than had Mr.
Roosevelt.'
Senator Smoot of Utah, who had
come aboard the train at this point,
also spoke a few words before the
train pulled" out as did Senator Ful
ton. â¢ All the speakers were loudly ap
plauded and three tremendous cheers
for Roosevelt and Fairbanks and the
Republican ticket were given as the
train moved away.
Delivers Early Morning Address to
Residents of Elko.
FAIRBANKS IN NEVADA.
The Woodland Democrat's allusion to
the "bird cage" at the Veterans', Home
is something that may' afford special
delight to one class of Bell's supporters.
The officers' cottage on the home prem
ises, which is presided over by, an esti
mable German lady, the mother of five
children. Is a place that is occasionally
visited by the wives and daughters of
the officers and directors. The innuendo
contained in the appellation "bird cage"
is obvious.. The modest hospitality of
the cottage Is extended to the national
and department commanders, to the
national ' board " of managers and to
"many other guests. â "Among ; leading
Democrats of < Napa" County ; who ; have
broken bread , at the cottasre table . are
"Vulgar and intemperate personal
abuse rather aids than hurts a candi
date before the people for political of
fice. Mr. McKinlay will suffer no harm
â In fact, he will gain rather than lose
votes â as the result of a stupid effort to
belittle and besmirch him. Mr. McLach
lan of Southern California will likewise
suffer no annoyance by ridiculous and
disparaging personal remarks put forth'
in Ignorance and malice."
Some of the Democratic comments
are amusing. For instance, the Wood
land Democrat fancies that Bell ought
to be re-elected to Congress because he
closed the canteen and diminished the
the death rate at the Veterans' Home.
The Democrat accepts as gospel truth
a statement made to the little coterie
of delegates which nominated/Bell at
Santa Cruz that a great falling off in
the death rate had followed the closing
of the canteen. The truth Is that there
were five deaths at the home In July,
1903, when the canteen was open, and
six in July, 1904. when It was closed.
There Is practically no change, in this
respect. The veterans who want whisky
and feel that they must have it get It
at the saloons In Yountville. If Bell
could close all the saloons in the State
and wholly prohibit the sale of liquor
the death rate might be diminished, but
he cannot lower it by forcing a thirsty
veteran to walk a mile to get his glass
of grog.
THE "BIRD CAGE."
Concerning the vicious attacks on
McKinlay the Sacramento Union say's:
The Democratic campaign in the Sec
ond District has reached a deplorable
state. It has descended to vile attacks
on Hon. Duncan E. McKinlay, who
was nominated by the Republican con
vention in response to the almost uni
versal demand of the people of the dis
trict. The Republican nominee is mak
ing a splendid campaign, winning sup
porters wherever he goes. The large
meetings and the spontaneous enthu
siasm in support of his candidacy at
test his popularity. The people indorse
him as a leader who will worthily rep
resent the Important district in the
next Congress. Â¦ â¢Â¦Â¦'
The Democratic nominee in the Sec
ond Is explaining, explaining and ex
plaining. He explains why he had the
canteen abolished. He explains that he
is not a prohibitionist and not an en
emy of protection. In all his explana
tions he does not explain why. he re
gards President Roosevelt as a dan
gerous man. The Republican news
papers of the district are insisting on a
definite explanation of his views in this
respect. The party alignment in the
Second District is clearly defined. *rbe
Republicans will vote for McKinlay and
the Democrats will vote for Bell..
VICIOUS ATTACKS.
SECOND DISTRICT.
The Congressional campaign in Cali
fornia grows decidedly interesting. The
Democratic party is making a desper
ate effort to gain control of the next
House of Representatives. A gain of
sixteen Congressmen will give that
party such control. Messages come
from Democratic national headquarters
that the party must not lose a seat in
California, but according to trust
worthy reports from the State the peo
ple of California intend to elect eight
Republican Congressmen, which result
will diminish rather than increase the
Democratic strength In the next Con
gress.
A. Caminetti, the Democratic nominee
for Congress in the First District, is
telling the miners that if he is elected
the so-called Caminetti act will be
amended so that miners on the little
mountain streams may be permitted to
work. The candidate practically ac
knowledges that the act which bears
his name is of no value to the miners.
The Republican State Central Com
mittee is taking care to inform the
voters of the First Congressional Dis
trict of the fact that when Caminetti
got his bill passed the House and Sen
ate were Democratic and a Democratic
President sat in the White House. If
Caminetli was then incapable of fram
ing and securing the enactment of
legislation favorable to the miners
what could he do in the next Congress
as a member of the minority. The Re
publican committee and the miners of
the State size up Caminetti as a false
alarm. In the First District Gillett
will beat him out of sight. The" miners,
farmers, lumbermen, merchants and
worklngmen generally resDect Gillett
for his manliness,' his" integrity, his
strength of character and his devotion
to the true interests of the district. If
Caminetti has any amendments to in
troduce he should draw them -up and.
present them to Hon. J. N. Gillett. c

The selection of a time and place for
the next convention was referred to the
executive committee. The California
delegation wired from Texas that It
was held up by a flood, and on behalf
of Los Angeles asked for the conven
tion.
The executive committee reported
several amendments to the constitution,
among which was one prohibiting the
payment of salaries to national of

work of the national officers under the
supervision and direction of . the Na

Is urged upon every club of the league and
upon-every Individual, whether first- voter or
veteran, that direct and personal interest be
taken in the polling list of the various dis
tricts; that the names of doubtful voters and
of young men casting their first ballots be
carefully noted; that whenever possible they
be connected with existing Republican clubs
or encouraged to organize new ones.
It It further resolved that the delegates to
thla convention be Instructed on returning to
their respective States and Territories to con

Republican State and county chairmen to the
end that harmonious and vigorous efforts for
the micceÂ«a of the national ticket be fully and

Resolved, That the incoming president of
the National Republican League be authorized
and directed to confer with the Republican
national chairman with a view of Inaugurat
ing Immediately after this convention on co
operative lines a thirty-day campaign club

voters of the United States.
APPEAIi TO ALL VOTERS.
Witness their efforts to compromise upon the
question of protection to American labor; wit

gold standard; witness the acknowledgment of
the Panama canal; witness the feeble efforts
of Democracy to wriggle away from Its respon
sibility upon the question of trusts; witness
the formation of constitution clubs In the East
in contrast with the constitution-breaking
clubs in other parts of this country.
This convention assembles at a time when
the glaring weaknesses and inconsistencies ot
Democratic arguments can best be portrayed.
Having done nothing, our opponents have
nothing to present. They are In business only
to find fault with those who do somethingâ
sarcasm and ridicule, like the envy which fol
lows success, are their stock in trade. We
have no fear they will deceive the Republican
anu Independent voters of this land, but be
lieving in the power of organization we earn
estly declare the imperative necessity that de
volves upon every Republican of casting his
vote upon election day for the maintenance of
Republican principles. No citizen should evade
that solemn task; no true Republican will.
The right of suffrage la the highest privilege
as it is the highest duty of the citizen.
Representing the Republican clubs of the
United States this convention, therefore, re
spectfully directs the attention ot the two
millions of volunteer workers who compose
It to the great Importance of active, energetic
and aggressive campaign work. It Insisted
that no Republican club man shall take for
granted that victory is assured; his duty and
that of his friends he may Influence is not
finished until the polls shall' close on the 8th
of November. , .
DEMOCRATIC INSINCERITY.
Full three months have elapse* since the
representatives of both great parties mada
their profession of faith and their declaration
of principles. The people have been mada
acquainted with the record and achievements
of . the Republican party and Its standard
bearers,- and they have listened to the criti
cising ' and pretensions of the opposition. On
the one hand it has been shown that the Re
publican administration has accomplished much
and labored long for the welfare of the people
and our industrial and commercial relations
at home and abroad; on the other hand, it
has been i argued by the representatives of
Democracy that whlla the country has pros
pered and good has come to the people In
domestic and material advantages It has been
due more to Democratic opposition than to
Republican advancement. The burden of
proof against the party In power has been
wholly with the party of contention, the
Democratic party.
Weighing carefully all the arguments ad
vanced In the name of patriotism, or in the
art of politics with Intent to reach a correct
Judgment. â¢ this convention Is unabla to find
wherein anything has been shown by the
Democratic party to Justify a change of faith
on the part of a single Republican. On the
contrary, it has been demonstrated In many
ways and in the vacillation of the Democratic
candidates that they are seeking merely the
confusion of Republican voters by laying claim
to established Republican doctrines and by
contending for honors which rightfully belong,
In spite of Democratic .obstacles, to the Re
publican party alone.
The National Republican League, in bien
nial convention assembled In the city of In
dianapolis October 6 and 6. hereby ratines the
platform of the Republican party adopted by
the national convention at Chicago June 22,

velt of New York, nominated thereon for
President, and the Hon. Charles W. Fair

President.
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â At the
opening of the second session of the
National Convention of Republican
Leagues to-day President Moore an
nounced that the election of officers
would be the first business. The names
of President J. Hampton Moore of
Philadelphia, Scott Bonham of Cincin
nati and Dr. J. H. McFatrich of Chi
cago were placed before the convention.
The nominating speeches displayed
some feeling.
Frank P. Lindsay of Kansas, H. T.
Leafitt of Nebraska and Alfred E. Lunt
of Massachusetts, campaign organizers
of the College League at the Western
Republican headquarters, said the lack
of organization in their States was due
to the failure of the national president
to devote attention to them. The first
two seconded Dr. McFatrich's nomina
tion and Lunt supported Bonham. They
charged that there was a cut and dried
programme to re-elect Moore. Judge
C. J. Gallenkamp of Kansas warmly de
fended President Moore from the criti
cism of the other speakers. Harry B.
Kirkland of the College League also
criticized President Moore, and charged
that there was an election slate to con
tinue the present officers in power.
The ballot resulted: Moore 793 2-.5,
Bonham 267 2-3, McFatrich 249 2-3. On
motion of Scott Bonham, seconded by
W. G. Edens of Chicago, the election of
Moore was declared unanimous.
The report of the resolutions commit
tee was then read. It was adopted
unanimously and is as follows:

The Board of Education yesterday
began the circulation of petitions to" be
filed with the Board of Supervisors
asking that certain amendments to the
charter affecting the administration of
the public School Department be sub
mitted to a vote of the people. It is the
intention of the board to obtain, if pos
sible, the signatures of at least 15 per
cent of the Qualified electors, as re
quired by the charter for the submis
sion of any amendment to the organic
law of the city.
The Board of Supervisors has already
sent a score of proposed charter amend
ments to the Election Commission to
be placed on the official ballot at the
election to be held on Novem
ber 8 next. President Ronco
vieri of the Board of Educa
tion takes the ground that charter
amendments shall only be submitted at
intervals of not less than every two
years. The last time charter amend
ments were voted upon was on Decem
ber 4, 1902, and Roncovieri contends
that the election this year for the pur
pose should be held on December 4. If
his contention is correct there is still
ample time for the Board of Supervis
ors to take action if it so desires.
The proposed school amendment con
templates making the Board of Educa
tion independent of the Board of Su
pervisors in the fixing of the annual
school budget. It places the power of
fixing the expenditures within a speci
fied limit in the hands of the School
Directors, and any item not approved
by the Board of Supervisors must be
designated. The amendment also pro
vides for a small tax for the payment
of teachers' annuities, and makes other
radical changes in the manner of con
ducting School Department affairs.
The Board of Education at yester
day's meeting granted the request of
the Alliance Francalse to use the James
Lick Grammar School building after

being frequently applauded.
The delicate relations between other powers

The United States, through the events of

all intei-national alliances which might involve
either the tsafety or the honor of the nation.
The United states never occupied a higher

in the utmost degree necessary that we should
be recognised as a nation which scrupulously
observes the rights of other nations; which
seeks to expand its Influence, not by the
power of might, but by thÂ« Irresistible force
of right. The victories of right are those
alone which endure. A continuation of the

When the Fairbanks train made its
first stop of the day at Elko, New, al
most 200 miles west of this city, the
Vice Presidential candidate was met
by Senator Smoot and seventeen other
leading members of the regular Repub

the travelers to Ogden. The Utah dele

Smoot, Congressman Howells, former
Oovernor Thomas, two members of the
State Supreme Court and other repre
sentative citizens, one half being Mor

eral of them conferred during the day

Senator Kearns. He was soon closeted
with the Indiana Senator. No state

decided to n.ake no reference to the

No speeches were made between Elko
and Otrden and the most . interesting
event of the day aside from the private
discussions of the Utah situation was
the travel across Great Salt Lake via
the Lucien cut-off on the Southern Pa

traveling companions found much in
that engineering feat to admire. When
this point was reached the party left

gas a' 967 Mission street la*t Wednesday died
at the Central Emergency Hospital last nights

strange one."
The police say they know very little
about Mulhatton's case. The court will
decide to-day whether the man was not
in a fit of mental incompetency when
he absent-mindedly placed a stranger's
coat on his back. Mulhatton seems to
be .unconscious of having committed a
crime.
The constable and party appeared
trith a writ of replevin for a small

THE CITIZENS OF REDDING
A gentleman who is a partner in a
local business concern, who is well ac
quainted with Mulhatton, had this -to
say of the man:
"Mulhatton was one of the best
known men In Louisville. He was a
crackajack drummer and a member of
a well-known. Southern family.; His
charities were numerous, " arid 'during
the ; big ' floods -; and * the season Â¦ of
1892 he gave -away money freely; ;Hls
fa d was to assist the newsboys, and
many a. dinner for the little lads was
paid for} by" 'Belknau's man.' as he was
OXCE WELL KNOWN.
Mulhatton, who is small, stout and
bewhiskered, sat down on the bench of
the jail office and thought a while. It
was a good opportunity to study him
in a pensive mood. He has a Email,
rather expressionless face, with a small
red nose and overhanging eyebrows.'
His hands talk for him, and while his
words roll from his tongue convulsively
they are somewhat incoherent, and the
index fingers are forced to furnish the
expression that is lacking.
"Barnum was publishing a story
about the great work of his trained
elephants," continued the prisoner with
a sweep v of his right hand, "and I con
ceived the idea of having Joe Parks,
the great Louisville cotton planter, im
port seven simians to do his cotton
picking. The Courier-Journal published
the story and Joe Parks had to leave the
country for a few weeks', but really I
did not intend to harm the poor fellow.
After this I had the big cave story in
print, and It was copied all over the
world." The yarn was that a cave larger
than the Mammoth had been found and
that a river existed therein on which a
full-sized river steamer could navigate.
The meteor story brought me orders'for
details from Paris and London. I wrote
that the aerolite was an acre square
and stuck out of the ground eighty
feet."
"Yes, I am Joe Mulhatton, who for
years was a leader among the travelers
of the East," said the prisoner as he
approached an interviewer yesterday
afternoon. "It has been ten years since
I was In Louisville, and I have almost
forgotten, about my relations with
Belknap & Co. and Hart & Co., the big
hardware men there. I was with
Belknap & Co. before leaving for the
West, but I lost my job â well, you know
why."
Mulhatton then related how he had
wasted his money and become a wan
derer,, a Salvationist, a circus follower
and finally a phrenologist. He had suf
fered from injuries incurred through
the kick of a horse and had not been
In good health since that time. He went
to Arizona, and for a while was en
gaged in mining, until his trial for in
sanity, brought about because of his
mental weakness, evinced during a deal
involving a mining claim.
"Why did you write the queer stories
of the rival to Mammoth Cave, which
were published in Frank Leslie's Mag
azine, and the story of the 'Seven Mon
keys of Joe Parks' ranch'? was asked.
"Just for an advertisement," was the
slow reply. "I was a drummer, and it
was my plan to keep myself before the
public. The stories that gave me the
name of the 'king of newspaper fiction'
were harmless, you knowâ well, harm
less to my business. I Just did it In fun,
and yet there was a reason for It. I'll
tell you, sir, I really didn't mean any
thing- by them."
But Joseph Mulhatton, once a chum
of millionaires, is apparently suffering
from a mental collapse. He does not
look like a coat thief, nor does he talk
like one. The instincts of a gentleman
are there, for the wraith of the past has
cast its faint shadow over his muddled
brain. No mental spectroscope can
thoroughly define the dark rays that
are peculiar to this strange combina
tion of lights and shadows. This morn
ing in the Police Court Judge Mogan
will determine whether the man is
guilty or innocent. The impression
seems to be that some one has blun
dered, for friends of Mulhatton say
that he never had the cast of a thief.
Two of these gentlemen are prominent
business men of this city.
"YES, I'M JOE."
Ten years ago Joseph Mulhatton was
the hardest hardware man to beat in
the southern part of the United States.
To-day he Is the hardest problem in
human nature to bring to a logical con
clusion that has ever presented itself
to the keen scrutiny of the local police
detectives.
Ten years ago Mulhatton was a
wealthy prosperous traveling sales
man for one of the largest hardware
houses in the country. His salary was
$15,000 a year. He was the author of
stories in the Fort Worth Gazette con
cerning "the largest meteor that ever
struck the earth" They created a sen
sation in all Europe, as well as on the
North American continent. He was
known as "the father of newspaper
fiction" for his clever literary creations,
which, though made out of whole cloth,
raised the curiosity of the English
speaking world.
To-day Joseph Mulhatton is an un
couth prisoner in the Central police sta
tion. Wednesday's Call told the story
of his brief and unfortunate career in
San Francisco. He was arrested at the
instigation of a man named Wantz, who
is^ proprietor of a cheap lodging-house
on Clay street. Wantz says that Mul
hatton has been a member of the Sal
vation Army, a phrenologist and a
roustabout. The charge against the
prisoner is burglary. Mulhatton took
off his coat while trying to exdaln a
mystic chart to a sleepy audience, and
when he put it on again the garment
had been substituted by another that is
said to have contained "a sum of
money and a bank book." With this
valuable find in a somewhat flyblown
"business office," he made his way to
the street, where the arrest for the des
perate crime was made by Mr. Wantz
and a policeman.
SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 6. â Der
bin Dally, a youth from Shelbyville,
Mo., occupies a cell In the County
Hospital, charged with insanity, his
mental trouble being due to unrequit
ed love. This morning he wrote the
following letter to his sister. Miss Amy
Daily, at Shelbyville:
"Dear Sister: I am disappointed in
love and cannot bear this pain. In
closed find check for my bank ac
count. Am sorry this has come to
pass, but cannot help it. Good-by,
one and all. Your brother.
"DERBIN DAILY."
Daily was jilted by a woman he met
at Los Angeles. She was carried away
by the Klondike gold craze, but prom
ised, to marry him. The shock re
ceived by Dally when he heard of her
marriage at Dawson City dethroned
his reason. He would have carried
out his design on his life but fpr a
physician, who knew of his intention
and had him taken into custody.
The check Dally inclosed in the let
ter to his sister was for $2000.
At the opening service of the
woman's auxiliary of the board of
missions to-day the sum of S 143,1 17,
was contributed to the board. This
sum represents the work of the aux
iliary organization during the last
three years.
Dr. J. Houston Eccleston of Balti
more, on behalf of the committee ap
pointed to confer with the various re
ligious bodies regarding conformity as
to the marriage of divorced persons,
submitted a report. It included a
resolution drawn up by the joint
church conference on divorce enjoin
ing ministers to refuse to unite In
marriage any person or persons whose
marriage such minister shall have
reason to believe is forbidden by the
laws of the church in which either
party seeking to be married holds
membership.
The committee on national legisla
tion reoorted that action must first
come through a united church move
ment. The Archbishop of Canterbury
pronounced the benediction.
At the afternoon session the Arch
bishop of Canterbury was invited to
occupy a seat on the platform during
the convention.
If that be true. It surely behooves every
gathering of churchmen to consider well what
they can do to safeguard thn men and women
and above all the children of America and of
England from a peril whose gravity it is im
possible to overestimate, because it affects the
very foundation of our Christian life.
I come to tell you of the ab^irblnsr Interest
with which we In England watch your gath
ering strength, your constantly increasing use .
of the apparently boundless opportunities ,
which are multiplying dally, and of our fellow- .
ship in your prayers for the splrtt of wiÂ»- ;
dom and understanding, of counsel and of
strength. Tour problem* are not all of them
our problems.? Anyhow this at least is certain, ,
that beneath them all we find underlying ele
ments which are absolutely common to uÂ» '
both. Among them is the temptation common
to ecclesiastics, lay and clerical, in every
clime and In every century, the temptation to Â¦â¢
Klve "means" rather than "ends'" the main
place in our thoughts, the temptation to lose
the true proportion between large matters and .
Â¦mail, the temptation to take a petty view of
what life's issues really are.
It Â«eema to me the paramount necessity of
all is that which concerns the family and tbe>
home, the common workday life, that is, of
the Christian people at large. It would be
vain to ignore the warning voices which tell
us. on either side of the sea. of a certain de
cadence in the religious life of. the ordinary
home.
BOSTON. Oct. 6.â The Archbishop of
Canterbury, speaking before a Joint
session of the house of bishops and
house of deputies of the Episcopal
church at Emmanuel Church to-day,
delivered a message to the American
body In which he urged that the church
take steps to guard the religious life
of the home.
At to-day's session of the house of
deputies several resolutions to make
more stringent the canon on the re
marriage of divorced persons were pre- .
sehted. The whole question will come f
up later. After reporting against a ;
change in the legal name of the church ;
at this time, the committee appointed I
by the last convention to consider the j
matter was discharged.
When the house of deputies as- 1
sembled to-day there was a large at- j
tendance of visitors In anticipation of '.
the presence of the Archbishop of Can
terbury, who yesterday announced that
he would deliver a message to the
American church. He said in part:
VANCOUVER, B. C. Oct. 6. â The
steamer Boscowitz is a wreck at Har
beldown Island, Parsons Bay. She
struck a rock In the night and then
broke in two. Four Indian children,
who were passengers on the steamer,
were drowned by the capsizing of a
small boat In which they had been
placed. The other passengers, . of
whom 120 were Indians and six whites,
were landed safely..
The steamer was on her way north
from this port, taking Indians and
their belongings to the Skena River,
the Indians having been working in
the hop fields. The Boscowitz was
owned In Victoria and was worth
about $8000.
FRESNO. Oct. 6.â What is considered
the most severe storm which has ever
swept the San Joaquin Valley passed
over this city early this morning. Old
timers in this city say they never saw
anything like it and the Weather Bu
reau reports show that for eighteen
years there has not been a storm dur
ing which so much water fell- In six
teen hours 2.36 inches of rain fell. Part
of the time it came down in torrents.
The merchants were notified early
this morning by night watchmen and
policemen that their cellars were be
ing flooded and crews of men were kept
busy for hours building embankments
with sacks of bran and any material
obtainable to keep the water from dam
aging their goods. A large excavation
by the side of the Odd Fellows' build
ing became filled with water whjch
broke through the foundation, rushed
into the cellar, threatening the destruc
tion of the building. Fire engines were
kept busy all day pumping the water
out.
Lightning was frequent and severe,
and in several parts of the city trees
were shattered.
The raisin growers were given little
warning and in the districts of Mala
ga and Reedley much damage was done
to the drying crops. The wind played
havoc In many places, carrying sheds
a distance of thirty feet.

everything of an ordinary, nature will be ire*
to visitors. There will be no charge for water
or lavatory accommodations. In ; toe hot days

Colcnel Dosch says that one new
feature about the Portland fair will be

the visitors who come June 1 will me
It all. No other world's exposition has
evÂ«r been ready. on time. The Louisi
ana Purchase, unfortunately, was lat
est of them all. All the buildings at
Portland are ready except that for
electricity, transportation and machin
ery, which three will be housed under
one roof. It will be finished in plenty'
of time. The streets and roads in the
grounds are all finished and the floral
spectacles and lawns are already com
ing into life. Portland wisely built its
exposition roads and streets first and
Its fair afterward. Visitors who go
early will not find men still trying to
make footways for them and mud and
dust will not assail them.
FAIR OF ACTIVITY.
Colonel Henry E. Dosch of Portland,
who has represented Oregon at six
world's exhibitions and has thorough
experience in exhibit work, is here as
commissioner general to the Louisiana
Purchase from the Lewis and Clark
Fair. He is also director of exhibits of
the latter. He has .been here since the
opening of the St. Louis fair and has
been able to Judge what are the most
popular exhibits here'.
WILL. BE HEADY OX TIME.
Californians here are criticized for
the use of but one distinct provincial
ism. That is the use of the word
4 pack" for "carry." Its use grows from
the pack trail. No burro nor mule ever
carried anything in the mountains, it
packed it and the Caliromian gradual
ly came to speak of everything as be
ins packed, even a newspaper or a
delicately beribboned box of candy.
But all this has nothing to do with
the Portland exposition. Portland is
not missing any tricks at the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition in the effort to
assist her exposition, except perhaps
that of properly advertising and she'll
wake up in that regard later. She has
accomplished results hrre that insure
the removal to the "Lewis and Clark"
â the briefer name her fair has as
sumed â of the cream of the foreign and
domestic exhibits at the dt. Louis fair.
Most of the things of great interest
Been here will be displayed there.

BY PAUL. HOWARDS.
California is deeply concerned in the
success of the Lewis and Clark fair, for
it will reap much benefit if the at
tendance is -large. Most of the peo
ple who go to Portland from the
East will visit California before re
turning, and in fact many will go to
the fair that they may have an op
portunity of seeing the Golden State.
It is said that round trip tickets from
the East will be placed at a very low
figure. By her exhibit at the Port
land Fair, California will reach peo
ple of the Northwest who have never
attended Eastern fairs and who are
possible settlers or customers.
H. W. Goode, director general of the
Portland Exposition, will come here
this month to attend to important de
tails.
The States of the American Union will be
given thi? much desired privilege of making
their exhibits in their own buildings. This is
the most profitable way for them to exhibit.
California and most of the big Eastern States
will be represented by ptructures of their own,
a* far as we can team. If any foreign nation
wishes to erect a building, it may do so. Some
of the South American republics and Mexico
will exhibit. The United States Government
will Â»nake an exceptionally One display. Its
building will cover "CO acres and will be a
feature of the fair. All the Government ex
hibits here that we want will be sent out, and
the Lewis and Clark board will meet in Wash
ington on October IS to decide what exhibits
shall be sent from there to nil the rest of the
space. There are some ' things shown heie in
the naval line that we have a thousand fold
better In the harbor of Portland, right at the
edge of the exposition.
I am working now toward getting .some
manufacturing sections together for the fair.
That Is, we want the various manufacturers
of different articles to give a collective demon
stration of the process of manufacturing each
article. We will have a rope factory and a
woolen making plant among other things, and
perhaps a perfume factory â Oregon to supply
the flowers. A feature of the exposition will
bf a tiisi'lay of 10.000 blooming rose bushes.
They are to be of the finest varieties. New
hotels for the accommodation of visitors are
being constructed.
California is our big sister, and we are
looking to her to make a fine exhibit in the
interests of herself and .the whole Pacific
Coast.
GOVERNMENT DISPLAY
I have enough exhibits in sight now from
Japan, China, Austria, France. Russia. Ger
many, Italy, England. Holland, Norway and
Sweden and BtlRlum to fill the. entire foreign
building, and all os tlir best. Japan ha* se
cured one-third of the entire floor space of this
bulldli.s. and besides rttt will have a tea garden
covering tn-o acres. The Oriental exhibit will
he very flne. Besides Japan, China, Korea,
Siam and Dutch India will make displays. The
Philippine- will bring out the best of their
display h;re. The management of the fair wll
allow no fakers to cry thrir wares ia the ex
hlbit places. This practice detracts from thl
dignity of an exposition. Besides ' this the
public is annoyed and many are sold things
that have no value. \
the tlrroty will have at every hand the purest,
coldest njnuntain water, piped trom Bull Run,
which has its source at a lake at the foot of
the crater on Mount Hood. No other exposition
Â«ver had such water.

TAFT NOT WORRIED.
MANILA, Oct. 6.â A mass-meeting of
Filipinos is to be held Sunday at the
National Theater. The call for the
meeting states its purpose to be "to
take some definite action upon the pop
ular desire, to wit, the giving of our
sincere support and sympathy to the
American committee on Philippine in
dependence in its efforts to attain thfc
erÂ»d we desire. It would be inexplicable
and even improper for Filipinos to fold
their arms and remain passive at a
time when the very best elements of
American society are working ardently
in order that our native land may at
tain its ambition."
If a few hundred of our "farmers could be
induced to spend a week or two In the. Palace
cf Agriculture and Horticulture they would be
inspired to taka up so many new lines of pro
duction adapted to new marketB- that the
"boom days" would return to stay. Consider
for a moment a single building covering twen
ty acres of ground with ten miles of avenues
from twelve to twenty-five' feet wide, crowded
on both nldes with the products of all lands,
fresh and preserved, and in all manner of
packages to attract attention and temct the
palate or appetite, and that a person- must
travel more than twenty miles to be able to
see both sides of the avenues; then will me
be able in some degree to comprehend the vast
educational advantages to be obtained by v s
itlng the Louisiana Purchase Kxnjultlon
The World's Fair has. brought us into direct
and actual contact with people from all parts
of the world. Whatever may have been our
conception of the perfections of our own social
relations at the most southwestern seashore
of the United States, there Is not one person
of us who haa not eeen many places where the
rough corners of not only our particular sec
tion, but of the entire Pacific Coast, and for
that matter the whole country, have not been
rounded off and more or less polished by the
habits, manners and customs which obtain
among the representatives of all the nations
here congregated. With us the social side of life
has been thrown so far into the background
by the rush and push of competition, engen
dered by the insane desire of money-getting,
that its pleasures have been almost eliminated,
but will now be taken up and applied in such
a manner that ultimately our social condition
will be vastly improved.
To the farmer of this, section the world's
processes of agriculture are spread out. and
he will not be slow in adopting every method
which will reduce manual labor and cheapen
the cost of production. The products of agri
culture and horticulture the world over are in
evidence, and as every country is willing and
anxious to exchange the fruits of its field, or
chard and vineyard with those of every other
country, we may confidently look forward to a
large increase In number and variety of agri
cultural and horticultural products.
Of special interest to the farmer in thÂ«
comparison of our cereal grains with those of
other countries, and he will be prompted to
ask why he should plant oats that weigh from
26 to 35 pounds to the bushel when at the
tame time he sees that New Zealand grows
oats weighing more than forty-five pounds to
the bushel, and at no greater cost. The same
applies to many other farm products. The veg
etable growers will take advantage of the ex
hibition of the vast number of toothsome veg
etables shown in the French and Japanese sec
tions, grow them, pack them in equally at
tractive packages and demand admission to the
markets of the world. Many eyes have al
ready been turned In this direction, and the
virgin soil of San Diego County will not mis
lead the investigator into the possibilities of
competition with those who now command the
irreat market.
No county in the State can show a greater
variety and number of .flber-produclng plants
than can San Diego County, and it only
remains for the farmers to take up the matter
of production on. a scale that will Induce
manufacturers to take the raw material "aid
turn out the million!' of pounds of binding
twine used annually east and west of the Mis
sissippi River. An examination into this sub
ject should add to the list of farm product*
this most Important one, and thereby establish
a new and valuable Industry. Every country
exhibits its most advanced Implements In every
department of human activity, and many of
them will be adopted by our people. It is
much to be recrettfd that the schools of San
Dleeo County are not represented In the-Pal
ace of â¢Edueataion. Nevertheless every advance
will be noted.

German day in the United States is the cele
bration of the friendship of the German and
American people. We German-Americans are
the hyphen between Germany and America;
we present the living dsmonstration of the
fact that a large population may be trans
planted to another country and may be devoted
to the new fatherland for life and death, and
yet preserve a reverent love for the old. .We
are the embodiment of a necessary peace and
friendship between the two nations.
No interest in friendship could be more
natural than that between Germany and the
United Stnteb. They are tied together by thÂ«
bonds of kinship and Germanic spirit, and
also by the complete absence of a conflict of,
great interests that might divide them. - In
deed. I challenge any one to show me a single
point in which the interests of the two coun
tries, or even their legitimate ambitions are
hostile to one another. There la no such point
to Â¦ be found, absolutely none.
What could there be then that might trans
form the friendship of these two nations into
hostility?
I am well aware of the efforts that are
being made to goad- them against each other.
I have hf-ard people say that Germany and
this republic, which are both now expanding
with ambitious new navies, with or without
cause, some day will have to measure their
strength on the soÂ«-caHed field of honor, and
that on both sides adventuresome heads among
the nuvy officers are busying themselves to
think out the plans and preparations for this
FtrugrK
What are we to think, that war is only a spot
like a football game between muscular uni
versity societies? Whenever a man expresses
such principles every honest boot should lift
Itself to kick him out of the society of civil
ized men. Whenever any one comes to you
with the old, long contradicted story that
German officers are traveling through thÂ« coun
try as spies, I pray you tell him boldly to hlg
face that either he has- himself invented such
lies or that he is engaged in circulating the
lies of others. t- Â¦
FRIENDSHIP OF GERMANY.
' Carl Schurz was then introduced and
spoke in part as follows:
You are all aware of the warm interest the
German Emperor takes in your life and doings.
The splendid monument of German accomplish
ment and knowledge created by him phtnes as
one of the principal gems among the dazzling
treasures of tills exhibition. It proclaims that
both the German Fatherland and your Ameri
can -adopted country have produced similar
great things in their astonishing development.
His Majesty the Emperor requested me to
announce the following rressage:
Â¦"I convey my Imperial greetings and Con
gratulations to those dauntless citizens of
America whose wish it has been that the
World's Fair at St. Louis should not pasa by
without the celebration of a German day. .. .
"May this glorious d*y M celebrated in un
marred rejoicings and stand as a worthy testi
monial of the important part played by thA

joined in singing the hymns of the

"Star Spangrled Banner."

for a living as an impecunious sort of
a person, but It is evident that beer
and skittles are occasionally his por
tion. In reply to the question as to
what was the best haul of mackerel
he had ever made, an ex-fisherman of
Gloucester, Mass.. recently said:
"The best trip I ever made was when
we took a big fare of mackerel off
Block Island and salted them. I wa?
getting $30 a month as cook, together
with my share of the catch. You may
or you may not know that the cook is
the hardest worked man on a fishing
schooner. He simply has to keep busy
all the time and give the crew the five
meals a day, with luncheons between
times, which seem necessary to enable
them to do the hard work called for
when fish are plenty. We cruised the
time I am speaking about west and
north of BIcok Island, and the fish
were schooling welL It was night and
day work, always with a man at the
masthead after the sun went down,
when the fish would show up from the
phosphorescence in the water. The
skipper saw more money In salting the
catch than in trying to run fresh fish
Into Newport, so we just stayed oat
there, jogged up and down and rata
ered them in. Well, sir. when the profit*
of them twenty-one days were divided
the share of every man was $354 on
top of which I eot $21 for wages as
cook. Net so bad for the humble fish
erman, was it?" â New York Globe.

that the resistance of the Hereros is
broken, that discord prevails among
the native chiefs and that many war
riors are ready to surrender, but fear
they, will be shot. The Hereros suffer
ed terribly from lack of water, owing
to the fact that they were driven from

General Nelson A. Miles was the prin
cipal speaker to-night at a meeting
held In Park Street Church to consider
the question of the reduction of arm
aments and the menace of great ar
mies and navies.
The secretary read a letter from
Andrew Carnegie, dated Skibo Castle,
Scotland, proposing a plan for the at
tainment of peace. Carnegie's propo
sition was:
John I. Gilbert of New York moved
that the amendment be laid upon the
table, and General Henry B. Carring
ton of Boston seconded the motion,
declaring that the congres3 had no
right to criticize the United States for
maintaining an armament by means
of which the Monroe doctrine and,
therefore, peace was insured in the
West and also by which the "open
door" was secured in the East.
In speaking to the resolutions. Dr.
Darby lamented the policy of in
creased armament in the United States
and expressed the hope that "the
party in America which had got trie
country into a declining plane will not
be able to carry it any further."
A pronounced difference of Â©pinion
developed when Rev. Charles F. Dole
of Boston introduced an amendment
to the resolutions reciting that no ne
cessity existed for the United States
to entertain suspicion against Euro
pean nations or to maintain such a
large navy to support the Monroe doo
trlne.
Delegate William Randall Cramer of
England recommended that it would be
better for the powers not to bring minor
conflicts in interpretation of arbitra
tion treaties to The Hague. He sug
gested that the less important differ
ences be given to a court of the first in
stance Instead. The Hague, he thought,
would be spared therel y for the higher
work. The suggestion was adopted and
the word '"all" before conflicts was
stricken out and the resolutions were
unanimously adopted.
The universal reduction of arma
ments, pronounced by Dr. W. E.
Darby of England, of the committee on
international law, to be the most Im
portant subject which the congress was
called upon to consider, was next taken
up, the committee reporting as fol
lows:
The coTigTess tfctsks thÂ« President cf thÂ«
United States for his premise to take thÂ« first
steps toward the convocation of a new inter
national p*ace corrrew to resume the delib
erations commenced at Th* Hague in 1539.
It expresses thÂ» npinlcn that the first task of
each coTigrrÂ»Â«s shoald be to elaborate and apply
a. definite plan of simultaneous arresit and rub
sequent reduction of armaments which Th*
Hajue conference declared to bÂ« a crushing
burden and a constant peril to the who!* world.
The congress especially rejoices at
the statement recently made by the
President of the United States that his
Government is now taking steps to se
cure arbitration treaties with all gov
ernments that are willing to enter upon
them, and trusts that many such
treaties will soon be concluded.
The congress heartily indorses the
recommendation made by Joint resolu
tion of both houses of the Massachu
setts Legislature in favor of "an inter
national congress at meet at stated pe
riods to deliberate upon questions of
common Interest to the nations and to
make recommendations thereon to the
governments."
CHANGE IX RESOLUTION'.
BOSTOX. Oct. 6. â At the reassem
bling to-day of the International Peace
Congress' Judge Alexander of England,
chairman of the committee on treaty
arbitrations, presented a detailed state
ment of answers received from various
countries to questions sent out by the
bureau at Berne on the development of
the treaty movement in the several na
tions. Almost all the powers reported
new treaties formed or negotiations for
additional treaties under way. The fol
lowing resolutions were then read- for
passage:
The ccngresi records Its lively satisfaction
at the signature of permanent and obligatory
treaties since Its last session between France
and Great Britain, Great Britain and Italy.
Frarwe and Italy, France and Spain. Great
Britain and Spain, Spain and Portugal. Den
mark and The Netherlands, Great Britain Â»nd
Germany, Sweden and Norway and France,
Sweden ar.d Norway and Great Britain.
The congress congratulates the governments
ef tfc^se various countries en. having thus taken
important further steps in the path of judicial
returns between nations opened by The Hague
convention. It tru>*3 that the examples thus
riven will shortly be followed by many other
powers.
JapÂ« Learn Fleet of Eighty Is
Engaged at Port Arthur.
TOKIO. Oct. 6. â The Port Arthur
blockading Seet has captured a Junk
ladea with provisions. The junk was
endeavoring to enter the harbor. The
statements of the crew of the junk
and the evidence found aboard indi
cate the existence of a fleet of eighty
junks organized to run the blockade
from the vicinity of Tsingtau.
Despite the vigilance of the block
ading fleet, many junks reach the
Russian lines at a number of landing
places on the lower end of the pen
insula. The junks enter at night, the
Russian guns and mine field guns
giving them an advantage over the
vessels of the blockading fleet. While
it is suspected that ammunition is
being smuggled in, none has yet been
found in the hundred of Junks that
have been overhauled and searched.

Ccu-rt Okuma said that corruption
appeared to- pervade the military, po

Russian Government, and that this cor
rupt'en had almost reached a climax
which threatened a revelation. It was
even reported that Lieutenant General
Stcessel, now defending Port Arthur

Expert opinion is divided as to
whether a serious engagement is likely
to occur at Mukden, but the dispatch
from that city reporting an unusual
activity there gives rise to much spec
ulation. It is impossible to say whether
th!s condition presages the evacuation
cf Mukden, but in an;- case it is evident
that something of unusual Interest is
pending. Some even are bold enough
to take it that General Kuropatkin is
preparing to assume the offensive, but
in view of the fact that the most re
liable advices credit him Â¦with only
about six divisions at Mukden, this Is
exceedingly improbable. It is thought
mere likely that the commotion had to
do with one or another of the Japanese
flanking columns, which the Russian
commander may have been preparing
to check.

The Count predicted that it would be
necessary for the Japanese Government
to borrow $230,000,000 next year, and
added that if $75,000,000 were secured
abroad the country must face a depre
ciation in the value of its securities. He
urgred the nation to carefully husband
its strength and resources, ajid ex
pressed the fullest confidence in the
ultimate victory of Japanese arms.
ma said, Russia possessed immense re
sources and had tremendous advan
tages in the size of her population and
the greatness of her wealth, and it
would be necessary for the Japanese
to make heavy sacrifices in order to
attain success. He predicted that the
war would cost Russia from Jl.oOQ.OOO.
000 to $2,000,000,000, and said it would
be impossible to raise loans or to in
crease the taxes in Russia, because the
limit had been reached.
Orders rrere issued to-day to all sea
nen belonging to the battleship Orel
and the cruisers Ole?, Zeemtchug 1 and
Irumrod to join their vessels at Cron-
Ktadt immediately. It is believed that
this presages the sailing' of these ves
sels to-mcrrc^r for P.eval. where Em
percr Nicholas is gclr.g to review the
whole Pacific squadron.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 7. 2:20
a. m.. â While the Admiralty claims to
have no knowledge of the departure
of the Port Arthur squadron, it is in
ferable from the way in which the re
port reads that such an event has
transpired and deliiiite confirmation
vonld not create surprise. The As
sociated Press is informed that no di
rect criers have been sent to Admiral
Wiren to break through the blockad
ing: T.eet. but It tacitly admitted that
the admiral has discretionary powers
to leave Port Arthur should the sit
uation demand or conditions be pro
pitious. In r.aval circles it is pointed
cut that Wednesday morning the con
ditions might have been favorable for
&. sortie. Heavy storms raged Tues
day ana doubtless compelled the
blockading vessels and particularly
the torredo-boats to seek shelter, thus
lexvisx the way clear for a dash to
Vladivostok. Some naval officers.

to slice the tempting confection the young hos

of the equally false cake disclosed the dainty
gifts prepared by Miss Dornln and her other

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. 6.
In a flght with footpads to-night at
Tenth and Oak streets O. E. Smith, 55
years old, a hostler, employed by Hill
house & Reardon, was shot In the left
arm. Despite his years Smith put up a
lively battle with. his assailants and
caused them to flee after they had shot
him, leaving a pistol behind them. The
weapon, with two empty shells and
three loaded cartridges in it, was found
on the sidewalk by George Dunbar, at
whose home, 1020 Oak street. Smith
lives.
The shooting occurred shortly after
7:30 o'clock. Smith was walking along
the east side of Oak 6treet Shade trees
line the sidewalk. Near Tenth street
and within a few feet of the Dunbar
residence, Smith said, two men sprang
at him, one with a loaded pistol aimed
at his head, and sternly ordered him to
throw up his hands.
Up went the startled hostler's arms.
But In the excitement of the moment
Smith soon dropped them. The armed
footpad fired a shot that missed Smith,
who in turn grappled with the high
wayman. Smith said he struggled and
fought with his assailants, who man
aged to shoot again before the wound
ed man tore the pistol out of the rob
ber's hand. Then his nearest assailant
fled. He did not know what became of
the other one.
After the shooting the injured hostler
hastened to the Dunbar house, where
Dr. W. A. M. Dunbar dressed the
wound, which was in the left forearm.
Smith was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital.
To the police Smith said he lost $7 in
the fight. The detectives found 70 cents
scattered about near the scene- of the
holdup. In the hostler's coat were
three bullet holes, Indicating that one
bullet must have passed through with
out hurting him. His wound Is not se
rious.

there is no chance of Parker carrying

declares that Parker is too much like
Roosevelt Bryan spoke here last
night in the Interest of the Nebraska
State ticket, but gave scant attention
to national affairs, devoting almost his
entire time to State issues and making
a strong plea for the election of the
fusion Legislature, that a Democratic
United States Senator may be selected
next spring. Bryan did not say in his
speech that he was a candidate for this
position.
"I need not discuss the relative
merits of the Presidential candidates,"
said Bryan, "because a Roosevelt vic
tory In Nebraska is certain for this
fall. The unfortunate split in the Pop
ulist and Democratic fusion electoral
vote makes Parker's defeat In Ne
braska a certainty."

which were sent out all over the Unit

Election Superintendent Tellg of Nat-

NEW YORK, Oct. 6.â In a letter to
the laws committee of Tammany Hall
State Superintendent of Elections Mor
gan said to-day:
"It is a matter of common notoriety
that elections In the State of New York
have been tainted with corruption
through the use of citizenship papers
fraudulently obtained from both State
and Federal courts, and also through
the use of forged certificates of natur
alization."
He then referred to the recent action
of the State Supreme Court In cancel-
Ing a number of naturalization certifi
cates, and continued:
"Large as the number of certificates
may seem which were canceled by
Judge Gildersleeve, this number is but
a small fraction of the naturalization
frauds undiscovered. This investigation
will be continued by this office within
proper legal bounds without interfer
ence or dictation on the part of any or
ganization. â¢ At the same time every
consideration which justice can extend
will be shown to the poor unfortunates
who, through Ignorance, come into pos
session of certificates which by the law
they are not entitled to possess.
"No effort will be spared and every
power vested in this office will be used
to stamp out this issuance of certifi
cates."

Professor Elwood Mead, head of the
department of irrigation in the Univer
sity of California, has Just published
the first part of an elaborate report
upon "Irrigation in Northern Italy,"
undertaken in pursuance of plans out
lined by the United States Department
of Agriculture.
"For fifty years Italy has been the
school of irrigation for the rest of the
world. France, Egypt, India and Aus
tralia have sent their ablest engineers
and economists to study the system
which for many centuries has made
Northern Italy one of the agricultural
storehouses of Southern Europe. Italian
practice has exercised the greatest In
fluence upon irrigation matters In oth
er parts of the world. The standard
works on this subject, however, were
mostly written in the days before the
rise of modern corporation methods,"
The elaborate studies which Professor
Mead has carried on in modern Italy,
therefore, as the agent of the United
States have the greater importance be
cause he has been able to observe mod
ern corporation methods and modern
governmental systems in ancient Italy
as she is to-day.
To report primarily upon those fea
tures in Italian irrigation practice
which are suggestive to American lr
rigators is Professor Mead's particular
object. To know whether Italian com
panies let the farmers manage the lat
eral canals, to know whether on a ditch
600 years old the farmers at the upper
end steal water from those at the lower
end, as they do In pioneer countries In
America, or if they do not how this
most natural human Impulse is over
come; to know how the available sup
ply of water Is divided among claim
ants; to know whether the division of
water among lrrigators is made by time
or by volume; to know the price lrri
gators pay for the water, how much
they use on different crops and how
seepage losses are lessened in one of
the countries where irrigation practice
has reached ita highest state of effi
ciency. These are some of the objects
which Professor Mead set before him
self.
Professor Mead also observed with
much interest and in this publication
reports upon methods of reclaiming
tidal marshes, both by dykes and
drains, and of protecting hillside farms
from erosion. He tells of hill farms
steep as any In Pennsylvania, Ken
tucky or Georgia which have been con
tinuously cultivated for many centu
ries, but which are as fertile to-day as
they were in the beginning: and not
worn out nor broken by gulleys, as in
many hilly countries In America, where
scarred hillsides are the outcome of
careless and unskillful practice.
The valley of the Po is first de
scribed, and Professor Mead then dis
cusses irrigation in Lombardy and in
Piedmont. The first part of his rep&rt
on his Italian observations may be ob
tained by addressing the Office "of Ex
periment Stations, United States De
partment of Agriculture, "Washington,
D. C. Two other parts are to follow in
the near future.

On motion of Dr. E. H. Woolsey.the
secretary was instructed to communi
cate with the authorities of New York,
Denver and other cities where similar
action to that proposed for Oakland
has been taken, and ascertain from
them what methods are best for the
successful formation of a new city and
county.
The committee appointed to secure
legal data is composed of Edwin
Stearns, H. C. Capwell and Judge John
Yule.
A majority of those present favored
a separate county, consisting of the
city of Oakland, a part of Piedmont
and all of the territory as far as San
Leandro, If the residents of that place
voted to come into the new county. If
this could not be done it was proposed
to extend the county line to High street
and thence to the water front.
H, C. Capwell and Edwin Stearns
spoke for the proposal, and short ad
dresses were also made by John T. Bell,
R. M. Brlare, R. J. Montgomery ami
Dr. E. R. Talt.
Plans for the formation of a city and
county government for Oakland, or
failing In that, the annexation of the
city to San Francisco, were discussed
by the Progress Federation this even

instruct the committee appointed at
the last meeting to report on the legal
steps necessary for the formation of a
city and county government and on the
legality of annexation to San Fran

No Inquest was held. The child's
funeral took place from the Freese
home yesterday.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 6. â Phosphorous
poisoning, due to eating matches,
caused the death of Raymond Freese,
the two-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs.
Otto Freese of .1523 Fountain street, ac
cording to the certificate signed by Dr.
Maurice W. Brown. Little Raymond
was taken violently ill four days ago.
At first his parents were at a loss to
account for his sickness. Later it 'was
discovered that in playing about the
house the baby had found several
bunches of matches and had chewed
the sulphur from them.
Dr. Brown was summoned and treat
ed the patient for two days, but so
powerful had been the effect of the poi
son upon the baby's system that the
physician was unable to give him re
lief and the little fellow died on Tues
day.
While half a dozen policemen were
hunting for William Moss, suspected
tin tapper and burglar, the object of
tha Etxeauous search reposed quietly
In a cell at the City Prison. Not until
thvy had exhausted themselves on the
hard trail was the accidental discovery
made that Moss was safely In Jail.
Moss was -wanted on complaint of
Ous Harris, a water front fruit dealer,
who said he had caught the man In
the act of rifling a caaQ drawer and
that the robber had escaped after a
fight. Moes went to the Receiving Hos
pital to have a scalp tround dressed,
but objected vigorously to Steward
Borchert'a treatment- The belligerent
patient tried to clean out the institu
tion. Borchert roundly trounced his
â¢ubject after attending to the injury,
and sent Moss to the City Prison on a
charge of disturbing the peace.

POLICE EXPECT SERIOUS
TROUBLE IN CHINATOWN
One of the worthiest charities in San
Francisco appeals for aid In the com
pletion of a shelter for homeless chil
dren.
The San Francisco Nursery for Home
less Children is situated at Mission and
Twelfth streets in dingy, uncomfortable
quarters, in an old ramshackle building
that has been used successively as a
family residence, a school and a shelter
for the unfortunate little ones.
For many years the home has been
located in the old residence, and while
money has been received for the care
and repair of the present quarters, all
the available money" has gone toward
the buying of a large of land on
which to build a home that shall be
worthy of the name of San Francisco.
After the purchase of the lot the next
thing to consider was the placing there
on of a suitable home for the children.
The nursery managers immediately
started in to raise funds for the erec
tion of a building. The sum of $15,000
has been raised for the proposed build
ing, but the managers are now trying
to get $20,000 more.

longing to the Sam Yup Society. A
member of the Chew Yee tong stood
on Jackson street, near Stockton,
shortly before 1 o'clock yesterday
morning and fired ten shots as a chal
lenge to the rival tong. One of the
bullets struck Toy Poy, a merchant at
837 Clay street, on the leg, Inflicting a
flesh wound. The revolver from which
the shots were fired was found by J.
Shea, a lineman, and turned over to
the police.
About a week ago a Si On Sler man
who worked in a jewelry store left
without paying his bills. He was
forced to return and liquidate. Thi3
angered the other members of the
tong. On Wednesday night several
members of the. rival tongs were in a
gambling resort In St. Louis alley and
the action regarding the jeweler was
angrily debated. A Chew Yee man
threw a vase at a Si On Sier man and
the challenge was the result.

unfortunate who died by his own hand.
The note is signed with a monogram
"F. J." or "W. J."Â« It was found yes
terday In the pocket of a man who had
been dead for about. a month in the
brush near the elks' paddock, in Golden
Gate Park. A small vial containing a
few drops of laudanum was picked up
near the body.
Owing to the ravages of decomposi
tion the features were unrecognizable.
A pocket diary of 1873 and the photo
graph of a woman with long , curls
taken about that time at W., F. Bay

a few newspaper clippings-were all the
property found on the person. On the

Yesterday It was annoiiced that
Erastus Young had decided to ap
point A. B. Southard, at present audi
tor of the passenger receipts depart
ment of the Union Pacific Company,
to the position refused by Klink at
Portland, and It was learned later thÂ«t
Southard has already started for this
city In response to a telegram from
Young. Klink's resignation has caused
a great stir In local railroad circles,
where he has many friends who are
at a loss for an explanation for
Young's strange treatment of the
Southern Pacific Company's auditor.
When he announced his changes last
week Young stated to the assembled
representatives of the accounting de
partments that the move was made
Eimply to disassociate the auditors
from the employes of the various
roads with whom they had come In
contact for many years, believing that
a change to a new field would mcrettau
the efficiency of the Harriman serv
ice. When seen yesterday Klink de
clined to discuss his resignation and
General Auditor Young, following
strictly the mandate issued by Presi
dent Harriman a year ago, will not
talk.
Klink will quit the company at the
end of the month.
OMAHA 31 AX COMING.
Last week Young suddenly an
nounced a number of changes in the
heads of the accounting offices. Klink
was ordered to Portland to assume
charge of the accounts of the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company; K.
S. Benson, auditor of the O. R. & N.
Company, was assigned to duty at
Houston as auditor of the Harriman
lines in TÂ«=.xas, and C. B. Seger, who is
at present auditor of the Texas lines,
was ordered to come to this city to
succeed Klink.
Klink, who was reared in Vallejo
and hag spent the better part of his
life in San Francisco, did not take
kindly to the idea of giving up his
lifelong associations. He also resent
ed what he regarded ingratitude for
his long services with the Southern
Pacific Company by being transferred
to a less important and distant posi
tion in the north. His only alterna
tive being retirement from the em
ployment of the company he prompt
ly resigned.
RESEXTS A CHANGE.
George T. Klink, auditor and assist
ant secretary of the Southern Pacific
Company, with which he has been
connected for twenty-two years, haa
severed his connections with that cor
poration. He resigned on Monday last
after an attempt had been made by
Erastus Young, general auditor of the
Harriman lines, to transfer him to
Portland as auditor of the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company,
Klink refused to accept the new posi
tion and promptly tendered his resig
nation.
The retirement of Klink, who is one
of the best known railroad officials in
the West and a man whose compe
tency has never been questioned, grew
out of a plan of General Auditor
Young to shift all the auditors of the
Harriman lines. Young and represen
tatives from the accounting depart
ments of all the Harriman lines have
been in conference in this city for sev
eral weeks discussing plans for sys
tematizing the accounting methods on
all the roads that make up the big
western railroad system.

riding a horse embellished with drap
ery advertising a certain brand of
cigars, blew sharp blasts from a mili
tary bugle and spurred his mount to
make it prance and thus attract the
attention of passersby to the adver
tisement aforementioned. Special Po
liceman Unger noticed that the horse's
sides were raw and bleeding where the
rowels had been driven into them so
he arrested the rider and charged him
with cruelty to animals. Judge Mogan
will hear the defense to-morrow.

And papa, a small man of meek de
meanor, arose and followed his bet
ter half.
-Id's all right, papa," said Mrs. Witt
man to her husband, after she had
thanked^ the Judge. "Der Shoodge haf
kindly gifen me der gontlnoo id, und
says dot ve can home go. Come along,
papa."
Mrs. Julia Wittman, who posed as a
complainant in Judge Cabaniss 1 court
Wednesday, appeared yesterday before
the same tribunal as a defendant, Miss
Clara Neall accusing her of disturbing
the peace the previous evening on Mary
street, where both ladies reside. Mrs.
Wittman requested a continuance on
the ground that she desired to consult
an attorney and the hearing was set
for next Tuesday.
Miss Anita Nolan denied that her
husband, T. J., was chasing her in
anger when .Special Policeman Cas
tro stopped and arrested him at Sixth
and Howard street* late Tuesday night.
"No, indeed. Judge, .he had no inten
tion of injuring me." said Mrs. Nolan
to Judge Mogan. "We were coming
home from a card party and he sug
gested that we hurry, as ne had to rise
early next morning. So we started to
run and I was several yards ahead of
him when this policeman tripped him
up. T. J. and I have been married
three months and we never had an an
gry word."
The officer reiterated his statement
that Anita was terror stricken and T>
J. ablaze with wrath when he saw
them and stopped the race, but his
Honor chivalrously took the lady's
word for It and dismissed the case.
"Emulate the leopard and change
your spots," was Judge Mogan's ad
vice to a fruit peddler who had ob
stinately ignored a policeman's request
that he keep his wagon moving along
Market street. Ere the laugh subsided
the case was dismissed.
Mrs. Grace Doig, wife of a machinist
and mother of five children, was be
fore Judge Mogan on the charge of
shoplifting. Special Officer Allen ar
rested her in the Emporium and found
concealed under her coat three small
framed pictures, which, he averred, she
had been seen to pick up from a coun
ter. The woman was unprepared to
offer a defense, and the hearing will
take place October 13.
There was a leave taking scene yes
terday morning in the corridor of the
Police courts that awakened more hu
man sympathy among the habitues of
the place than one Would reasonably
suppose to have lodgment there.
Judge Conlan had ordered sixteen
year-old Mary Carpenter, convicted of
waywardness, to an institution for the
reformation of incorrigible girls, and
she was seemingly In unrepentant
mood as she left the courtroom in
custody of Sergeant P. E. Fraher and
Patrolman. Thomas O'Flynn, accom
panied by her sorrowing father, Wil
liam B. Carpenter. Awaiting her in
the corridor were her mother and sis
ter, and when she appeared the two
women burst into violent weeping and
embraced her. For a moment she pas
sively accepted their endearments and
then her stubbornness abruptly gave
way, her arms flew around them and
the trio sobbed together. The two po
licemen considerately turned their
backs upon the miserable ones and
O'Flynn was seen to remove a tear
surreptitiously "from his rugged cheek.
When the father, also weeping, gent
ly interposed to return the prisoner to
her patient custodians, she fell upon his
breast and hysterically beseeched him
to forgive her for the disgrace she had
brought upon him as well as herself,
and the man soothingly stroked her
hair and begged her to be calm, assur
ing her that he forgave. They would
soon be reunited, he said, for he felt
certain that her conduct in the asy
lum would be so exemplary as to earn
her speedy release. His encouragement
gradually comforted the girl until she
ceased crying. Then she again kissed
her sister and parents.
"I'll be a good girl.'just wait and see
if I won't," were her parting words.

INTERESTING FACTS.
For Nearly Every Man, Woman or Child.
A chort time ago we published an ar-.
tide recommending to our readers the
new discovery for the cure of Dyspep-
sia, called Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
and the claims then made regarding
the wonderful curative properties of
the remedy have been abundantly sus-
tained by the facts. People who were
cautious about trying new remedies
advertised in the newspapers and were
finally induced to rive Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets a trial were surprised
and delighted at the results. In many
cases a single package costing but 50
cents at any drug store made a com-
plete cure and in every instance the
most beneficial results were reported.
From a hundred or more received we
have Epace to publish only a few of
the latest, but assure our readers we
receive so many commendatory letters
that we shall publish each week a fresh
list of genuine, unsolicited testimo-
nials and never publish the same one
twice.
From James Temmeisler, La Crosse,
"XVis.: Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
doing me more good than anything I
ever tried and I was 60 pleased at re-
sults that I gave away several boxes to
my friends, who have also had the
same benefits.
From Jacob Anthony, Portmurray,
New Jersey: I have taken Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets with the best re-
sults. I had Dyspepsia for 6 years
and had taken a great deal of medicine,
but the Tablets seem to take right a
hold and I feel good. I am a farmer
and lime burner and I heartily recom-
mend to everyone who has any trouble
with his stomach to use these Tablets.
From Mri. M. K. West, Preston,
Minn.: I have received surprisingly
good effects from using Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablet*. I gave one-half of my
last box to a friend who also suffered
from Indigestion and she had the same
good results.
From Mrs. Agnes K- Ralston, Cadil-
lac. Mich.: I have been 1 taking Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets and I am very much
better, and feel very grateful for the
great benefit I have received In so short
a time.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a cer-
tain cure for all forms of Indigestion.
They are not claimed to be a cure-all,
but are prepared for stomach troubles
only, and physicians and druggists
everywhere recommend them to all per-
sons suffering: from Nervous Dyspep-
sia, sour or acid stomach, heartburn,
bloating or wind on stomach and simi-
lar disorders.

delphiar Bulletin/ f'
THERE has recently been published under the authorization of
the Prussian Minister of Education a comprehensive review of
. the history and organization of public education in the German
empire, designed as a contribution to the educational exhibit of the
St. Louis Exposition. A compendium of the material, brought out
in condeYised form by Hcrr \V. Lexis of Gottingen* gives to the
uninitiated an illuminating view of the whole course of public educa
tion in Germany and offers opportunity for contrast with the sys
tem that obtains in our country.
The salient feature which presents itself upon a close study
of this little book by Her: Lexis is the evidence of Government
control throughout the entire German scheme of education. In the
twenty-two universities of the empire the entire administration fol
lows regulations set by imperial decree, sovereign privileges control
the operation of their faculties, appointments to their academic sen
ates come only from the Emperor's hand. Throughout the who!.;
regimen of the secondary and primary schools rigid civil service
rules control the selection of teachers, their tenure of office is coter
minous with their efficiency, and pensions relieve the burdens of old
age when retirement is forced upon them. In the elementary schools
regulations, while of no less bureaucratic a character, emanate from
the governments of the respective states in the .empire rather than
from central national authority.
Thoroughness is the pre-eminent characteristic of the German
system of education from the kindergarten to the university. That
merit cannot be assailed. Both in the trainingof teachers andin
the enforcement of the study requirements the scheme of education
obtaining in Emperor William's land is qualified to point the way
to some beneficial revisions of our own standards. Technical educa
tion, first established by Frederick the Great, has attained a higher
degree of specialization and perfection in' Germany than elsewhere;
In every avenue of knowledge. there is manifested a painstaking com
pleteness of effort, even amounting in some instances to finical pet
tiness, such as jvc see in no other educational sphere.

BLOOD CIRCULATIONâ Subscriber.
City. The discovery of the circulation
of the blood, as now understood, was
made by Dr. William Harvey, first pub
lished by him. however, in 1828. He was
partially anticipated by Servetus, Real
dus, Columbus and Cassalpinus. and al
most entirely so by Paolo SarpI, whose
claim in this respect has been generally
overlooked. The discovery waa com
pleted by the demonstration (with the
aid of the microscope) of the blood cor
puscles and the capillaries between 1653
and 1687 by Swammerdam, Malplghi
and Leeuwenhoek.
Flowing Veil Condemned.
It is said that the flowing veil, which
has been so popular this summer, is
to be condemned this fall. This ar
ticle of wearing apparel which has
added to the beauty of many young
women has been condemned at the
National Milliners' Convention in Chi
cago. No woman who expects to be
considered in style will wear anything
but a closely fitting veil, and.it must
be selected to fit her eyes, complexion
and shape, of her face.
"Imagine the despair of the automo
bile girl. What will she wear to hold
her hat down?" asked one woman.
"And what will our many young wom
en do without them ? The big ' bow
of veiling under the chin was most be
coming to most girls, and now that
they will have to wear close-fitting
veils it would be well to* establish the
fashion of wearing _ chiffon neckwear
with big bows under the chin."
In The Call, under the caption. **A
Disgusted Inventor," there recently ap
peared a humorous editorial based upon
a report that the alleged inventor of a
device by which users of the telephone
might see each other, has broken his
model and destroyed his plans because
he feared that he might be cheated out
of it. ]'Â¦ v
TheVe is a great deal of truth be
tween the lines of the first paragraph
of the editorial. The impecunious in
ventor to-day is a fool to hope for
practical aid in the development of his
ideas from the world of money. There
are tens of thousands of really valu
able devices â valuable to mankind â
that are rotting away in out of the way
garrets because the inventor has
sought financial aid to complete the in
vention and found that he must rart
with almost all of the fruits of his
brain's labor for the paltry sum neces
sary.
The device alluded to* in the editorial
is one that has been claimed by hun
dreds. Not one has yet materialized.
Briefly stated, it is based upon the as
sumption that electricity may be me
chanically converted into light, as is
electricity converted Into sound in the
uses of the telephone.
In 1S94 the writer, then residing at
Tacoma, while experimenting with the
solar spectrum, discovered the presence
of two additional rays, one of which
was electrical and the other magnetic.
Reasoning that vibration was the fun
damental base of the phenomena of
heat, sound and light, a theory so
lucidly illustrated in the telephone, the
writer constructed a device which dfd
transmit light forms.' Two boxes were
connected â¢ with a wire over which
passed an electric current. They wereÂ»
separated at a distance, one box being
at one part of the house and the other
at another part. When a light, such aa
a lamp or candle, was exposed in front
of one box an observer at the other
box perceived a luminous glow within,
the box he looked into.
The crude fact was established that
light forms could be transmitted by
electrical energy. But to perfect the'
apparatus so that It would present to
a distant observer the distinct outlines
of the Illumined form exposed at the
sending station, required experimenting
with improved mechanism, and the
-financial ability to provide such was be
yond the powers of the writer. The
name "telectroscope" was given to the
device and It waa mentioned at some
.length by many of the leading news
papers of the country, naming the in
ventor.:
No one, however, was willing to ad
vance the necessary funds and so the
matter rested. The Xew Tork Herald
did send their representative to me and
asked to be given a full account of the
invention. I replied to this modest (?)
request by saying: That If the Herald
would place, say. five thousand dollars
to the credit of the writer, to be used
in developing the invention. I would
give a one-third interest to the Herald
and, bmldes, confine all information to
that paper exclusively. The represent
ative of the Herald said he had been
| directed personally by Mr. Bennett to
! seek me and that he would lay before
j Mr. Bennett my proposition, v It un
doubtedly laid down and never arose.
My experience is that of thousands
of other â¢ Inventors, who, by reason of
their poverty and pride, have buried in
the graveyard of dead hopes Inventions
that, made public.- would bless the
whole world by lightening the burden
of toil and rendering possible a fuller
enjoyment of life.

is a pity that he had no adviser whom
he could trust to secure to him the

WHEN* the San Francisco Local Council of Women resolved
to urge the Board of Education to allow the yards of the
public schools to be utilfzed as children's playgrounds after
school hours, it indirectly testified to the rapid growth of the city's |
population during the last half-dozen years.
Prior to the American-Spanish war and the impetus it gave to
California's commerce and industry there was no lack of waste!
places, even in the most thickly settled districts, where boys and girls j
cculd disport themselves without danger from passing vehicles, i
Since then there has been a gradual filling of the empty lots with
dwellings to accommodate the steady influx of new residents, until j
now almost every available foot of ground within convenient distance I
of the business center is occupied. j
With the disappearance of the vacant realty appeared additional i
children and the growing necessity of providing safer means for !
their outdoor play than is afforded by the streets. The public Â¦
squares are neither numerous enough nor sufficiently equipped with j
recreative facilities to give the little ones the freedom of enjoyment ',
they seek and are entitled to, and the single public playground south j
of Market street serves only the need of its immediate vicinity, j
Cognizance of these facts was first taken by the Collegiate Alumnae, i
and consideration of the subject led to the suggestion which the
Local Council of Women has taken up and submitted to the.Edu
cation Board.
The idea is not entirely new. In several of the large Eastern
cities the yards of the public schools are open during all daylight
hours to the pupils, and the yard of one San Francisco school, the
Hamilton Grammar, is free of entry throughout the afternoon to any
decent appearing and well behaving lad who may apply to the
janitor in charge. Although this school is in a district less congested
as to population and containing more vacant lots than most of the :
other districts, its yard is crow-ded every afternoon with merry- i
making boys and the policemen patrolling the neighborhood are cor- |
respondingly relieved of care.
In the Eastern school yards that are never closed adults ap
pointed for the purpose discipline the children and are empowered =
to expel the disorderly ones. Similar functionaries would undoubt- \
cdiy be necessary in this city, and their salaries would be the only
Hem of expense connected with the plan's operation. The fact that '
the majority of the school yards are disproportionately small when :
compared with the number of children they are intended to accom- '
modate cuts no .significant figure in the proposal before the Board;
of Education, other than to emphasize the necessity of having ade
quate playgrounds attached to the school buildings of future con
struction. The play as well as the work of the pupils should be
considered when the plans of the architects are submitted.

IN" the first speech of his new fiscal campaign in England Joseph |
Chamberlain sounded a note of dole for the British empire that j
stubbornly persists in its policy of free trade. According to his j
speech at Luton in Bedfordshire the farming industry is virtually:
destroyed, there are fewer laborer? in England by a complete million j
than in the year 1851. the capital of British farmers has diminished \
by Si. 000.000.000; and, most convincing of all evidences of free;
trade's disastrous sway, there are. according to Chamberlain's word, j
i3,Gra,ooo people in Great Britain that are actually underfed â sub- J
jtcts of a free trade regime for whom the necessities of life are stint- j
cd below the normal point of comfortable existence.
Chamberlain, the astute financier and champion of. a united pan- j
British zollvercin in trade relations, sees in England's persistence j
in the antiquated free trade policy the shadow of coming disaster, |
even of disintegration of the empire. To the enormous bulk of trade
that is Germany's and France's, to the increasing encroachments of
American enterprise â fostered in each instance under the influence ,
of protection. Chamberlain seeks to turn the eyes of his reluctant
countrymen, who have been steeped in free trade theories as in the j
raw fogs of their native heath, from infancy. On this side of the
water this advocate of protection finds an ally in the very measures
he is seeking to set aside at home. The Democratic party promises, ''
upon election, to break down our protective barriers and throw our |
markets open to the heaped-up products of distraught England. '
Through the Democratic application of this principle, which Cham- j
berlain is seeking to eradicate from the economic creed of the Eng- j
lisb, the conditions crying for remedy over there would, singularly j
enough, be blessed with temporary alleviation.
During the last Democratic administration our ports were open j
to the products of England's manufactories and there was no mur- j
mur of protest from the merchants of that tight little isle ; as long i
as they had another nation to support them in their financial folly j
England waxed exceeding prosperous. But how did our balance ]
sheet stand at the end of four years of free trade? We had added j
Â£262,000.000 to our public debt. The year 1894 had been signalized j
by an excess of expenditure over revenue, the first in the administra- j
tion of the Government since 1865.
In the first year of free trade tariff rule our domestic exports
shrunk in value from $1,015,732,011. the figure for 1892, to $831,030,
785. This shrinkage progressed in a like ratio for the first three years
of free trade. Xo set of authoritative statistics registered the number j
of factories closed, of banks forced to suspend, of mortgages fore- j
closed on the homes of workingmen. The tale of those incidents is
too fresh in the mind to need the telling weight of figures.
Such were the days of free trade in that country and of such j
is the crisis now facing England. In the United Kingdom to-day !
there is being compiled by the very action of the free trade laws I
<:v. indictment against the precepts espoused by the Democrats of j
ibis country, than which there is no weightier. If home arguments \
hre not sufficiently convincing let the voter follow the course of ;
Joseph Chamberlain's fight for protection in Great Britain and draw i
analogies evident to even the most obtuse comprehension.

The Beethoven sonata was the
op. 22. Nearer to Beethoven-playing
came the pianist in the adagrio than
elsewhere throughout the sonata,
though certain passages in the first
movement were nobly characterized,
and both .the minuet and finale wore
various splendors. But Mr. Hofmann's
Beethoven sympathy is episodic, not
for the thine in mass.
A colossal group of Chopin etudes
followed. Space permits mention only
of brilliant tenderness of the C sharp
minor, and the F minor with its vi
.cious, anchored trill. In the two G flat
"Butterfly" studies the .pianist sim
ply flew. The audience encored both,
of course. A Gluck-Sgambati mel
ody, grave and lovely, a dashing
(Schumann-Tauslg),
and an altogether delicious "Hark,
Hark, the Lark," followed. A Llzst
rhapsody closed the programme, ex
cept for the imperiously compelled
encore, the" ' C minor nocturne of
Chopin. Saturday afternoon will be
the last recital.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
In the whimsical, daintily capricious
field Hoffmann skips lightly ahead of
perhaps any of his contemporaries.
He is here a very Puck of the piano.
Last night â by the way, to a largely
augmented and noisy house â the pian
ist gave the Schumann "Carnival."
Elfish, almost impish, was its hu
mor in places, like the laughter of
fauns through the leaves. At need,
too, it had all the brilliant bravura
quality, and at times considerable
tenderness â which is not the most no
table mark of tbe Hofmann genius.
But the wit of the thingr- â the word
is better than "humor" â most distin
guished the reading.
Something of the same quality one
lifted to in the old French group.
Technically they were adorable, and
only in the "Tenebreuse" (Couperin)
are the deeper emotions drawn upon.
Here, in "La Tenebreuse." Mr. Hof
mann achieved delightful breadth, rare
beauty of tone and noble poise. In
"Le Rappel des Ou.cn.ux," larks trilling:
through rosy mists, and the gro
tesque and stamping "Le Tambpurin"
(Couperin), he was equally and ex
quisitely within his sympathies.

Surgeon Charles F. Craig has gone

Hospital.
The young lieutenants do not take
kindly to General Corbin's suggestion.
They know that he is provided with
ample means. His salary is $7000 a
year, and it is reported that the income
of his young wife is somewhere In the
neighborhood of $10,000 per annum,
which makes a neat sum total for the
Corbins of $17,000 a year to keep the
wolf from the door.
Mrs. Corbin, who was Miss Edith
Patton, is well known in this city,
where she resided with her mother and
sisters until she went to Washington,

The athletic tournament to be held at
the Presidio on November 17, 18 and 19
is occupying a great deal of attentionu,
not only by the officers, but by the en
listed men. Major R. C. Van Vliet, who
has charge of the exercises, is an adept
in that line. He has chosen to assist
him Captain John L. Hayden, Captain
George P. White and Lieutenant M. E.
Locke.
In his anxiety to" escape being inter-'
viewed on the subject of the marriage
of young army lieutenants Major Gen
eral Henry C. Corbin, who arrived
from the East in his private car early
yesterday morning, hurried on through
to San Mateo, where the Corbins are
the guests of Mrs. Fred Kuhl. Gen
eral Corbin, who is en route to Manila
to assume command of the Division
of the Philippines, did not even visit
army headquarters here to pay his re
spects to Major General MacArthur.
His aid, Captain James A. Moss, called
at the Phelan building ror his chief's
mail and announced that General Cor
bin probably would make a formal call
on General MacArthur next Monday.

I Young women may avoid much sick- .1
ness and pain, says Miss Alma Pratt, if
they will only have faith in the use of
Lydia K Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
u Dear Mrs. Phtosam : â I feel it my duty to tell all yotmg women
how much Lydia E. Pinkham's wonderful Vegetable Compound has
done for me. I was completely run down, unable to attend school, and
did not care for any kind of society, but now I feel like a new person,
*ud have gained seven pounds of flesh in three months.
a I recommend it to all young women, who suffer from female weak-
ness."â Miss Alsia Pratt, Holly, Mich.
r FREE MEDICAL ADVICE TO YOU3TG GIRIiS. v> "- -~.
All young" grirls at this period of life are earnestly invited to
m-ite Mrs. Pinkham for advice; she has guided in a motherly way
hundreds of young women; her advice is freely and cheerfully
given, and her address is Lynn, Mass.
Judging 1 from the letters she is receiTinjf from so many young girls Mrs. 'â¢
Pinkham believes that our girls are often pushed altogether too near the
limit of their endurance nowadays in our public schools and seminaries.
Nothing is allowed to interfere 'with studies, the girl must be pushed to
the front and graduated with honor ; often physical collapse follows, and it
takes years to recover the loBt ri tali ty,â often it is never recovered.
A Young: Chicago Girl Saved from Despair.
"Dear Mrs. Ptn-kham:â I wish to thank you for the help and ben-
efit I have received through the use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound and Liver Pills. When I was about seventeen
_^â ggs^^js, years old I suddenly seemed to lose my usual good*
,f^SS*||KÂ£2|^egji^^ health aad vitality. Father said I studied too
hard, but the doctor thought different and
prescribed tonics ? which I took by the
quart without relief. Reading one day in
\ fe^g^^^^^^E^^ the paper of Mrs. Pinkham's great cures,
'^^^T <^^^^^^^^Qj and finding the symptoms described an-
) ** >y|Â§^gggfigBjgiF swered mine, I decided I would give Lydia
/ Ffw^^^S E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound a
I tr * a *- * n Â°k sa5r a vr0T^ *Â° the doctor;
ift&P'* * bought it myself, and took it according
c2if& s^Â£p&<ZÂ§Â£grFm to directions regularly for two months,
t^i-^^-j^^g^^^ 5^^^ and I found that I gradually improved,
r " jÂ®^Â«^^^55/ and that all pains left me, and I was my
+ Xp* t '*/ ) j iff old self once more. â Lillije E. Sinclair,
I 17 EÂ« 22d St, Chicago DL W
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is the one sure rem-
edy to be relied upon at this important period in a young girl's
life ; with it she can go through with couraee and safety the work
ehe must accomplish, and fortify her physical well being so that
her future life may be insured against sickness and suffering.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 6.â
M. A. Cadwallader, left halfback,
punter and star player on the Stanford
freshman football team, has been pro
tested by the University of California
as ineligible for the freshman intercol
legiate game on the 15th inst. Unless
Colonel George C. Edwards, chairman
of the University of California commit
tee, withdraws the objections he will
not be allowed to participate in that,
struggle.
Colonel Edwards bases his protest on
the Intercollegiate agreement which
states that no player entering Stan
ford or California from a col
lege of standing shall be al
lowed to participate in athletics for a
period of one year from the date of hlÂ«
matriculation. Cadwallader comes
from Pomona College, but w ; as only en
tered in the preparatory department
there, not having collegiate standing.
In the past, nota-bly the case of Magee,
captain of the 1006 freshman team, the
agreement has been construed loosely,
and men from the preparatory depart
ments of colleges have been 'allowed to
play on athletic teams under the same
conditions as an ordinary . "prep"school
athlete. Colonel Edwards' note came
as a surprise to Stanford, as Cadwalla
der's eligibility had not been ques
tioned here. v
The loss of Cadwallader would be a
severe blow to the prospects of the car
dinal freshman team. He is a' clever
trround-gainlng halfback and a long
distance punter. His place will be hard
to Jill. Until his standing is adjusted
he will continue to play with his team.

Eleven Is Declared Ineligible by

There was no meeting of the Super
visors' Police Committee yesterday, bo
the matter of the permit for this month
Is still in abeyance. As the permits
have been issued to the clubs in regular
rotation during the year, Manager
Coffroth is confident he will secure the
one for this month for the Shasta Club,
this being its turn. Should he be re
fused, the fight will take place at
Colma, both men having agreed to
this. It is estimated the receipts will
fall but little short of those in this city.
The expenses of promotion will be less
and the free list will be reduced to a
minimum. The officials of this city can
claim no favors when the fight is held
across the line.
"Al Hereford," representing Gans, and
Manager Coffroth of the Shasta Club
were ready, to sign the articles last
night, but Willie Britt, who represents
his brother, was indisposed and could
not attend. A new appointment was
then made for to-morrow night at the
same hour. There is no hitch regard
ing any of the conditions under which
the men are to fight.
The articles for the proposed Britt-
Gans fight were not signed last night,
but all parties to the verbal agreement
of Wednesday night consider the match
as made and will govern themselves ac
cordingly.

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
Smiling Schmiddy, with his pretzel
shoots and bends, was more effective
than Brother Joe. Corbett yesterday at
Recreation Park. He also received far
better support, which helped some. Lit
ale Terry McKune could not wing the
ball arotmd to the bases, and Corbett's
breaks were so wide that the youth
was* puzzled. Score: Oakland, 3; San
Francisco, 0.
The only men on the home team to
hit the ball safely were Corbett and
Barber^ - Brother Joe swung safely
twice, while Barber bit off threeâ a
double and two singles. The rest of the
heavy hitters were on Schmidt's staff
all the time and never had a chance.
Corbett was not hit hard at that and
his control was good, but whenever
the Commuters got men on the bases
they generally came all the way
around, for HcKurie could not wing at
alL The entire three runs were the re
sult of stolen bases, an error, a wild
pitch and passed balls. Hits figured
but little in the tally line.

CHICAGO, Oct. 6.â Big Ben, racing
for the first time in the bright burnt
orange colors of his new owner, Mont
Tennes, picked up 124 pounds in the
Flyaway handicap to-day, and won the
easiest race of his career. The stake
was worth $1800 to the winner. It is
said Owner Tennea also bet a sufficient
amount on him to win out the purchase
price of the big son of Ben Strome-
Mint Julip.
Horsemen marveled at the opening
odds of 6 to 5 laid against Big Ben,
when he had previously beaten about
the same field with a heavy weight
up and did it easily. He packed 121
pounds to-day, as if the weight was
only a feather. When he turned Into
the stretch- he led his field by eight
lengths. Prior pulled him almost to a
walk at the finish, allowing Mayor
Johnson to cut down his lead to four
lengths at the end. Safeguard and Big
Ben were the only winning favorites.
The stewards announced that Jockey
L. Wilson was indefinitely suspended
for his ride on Katie Powers yester
day.
The track was deep and heavy to
day, and the weather cloudy and cold,
affecting the attendance materially.

MORRIS PARK, Oct 6.â Hamburg
Belle had an easy task in winning the
classical Hunter handicap to-day for
three-year-old fillies. The spectators
reveled in the brisk autumnal weather
and saw a fair programme run off.
Last year's Futurity winner, Hamburg
Belle, was allotted 125 pounds by the
handicapper. thus requiring her to con
cede to Mineola thirteen pounds, to
Graceful seventeen pounds and to
Ocean Tide twenty-six pounds. .
Just about a year ago Ocean Tide
and Beldame were almost % on even
terms at the finish of this" great fillies'
stake. tA Jn this Hunter handicap Bel
dame was allotted 130 pounds, thus be
ing considered to-day thirty-one
pounds better than Ocean Tide, which
is 'a fair illustration of how the form
of race horses changes from year to
year and often from month to month.
Hamburg Belle was an odds-on fa
vorite. She justified the odds by the
manner in which she shot past the
pacemaker, Ocean Tide, on the inside
at the head of the stretch. She came
down to the finish with her rider,
Lyne, sitting perfectly still. Hilde
brand and Sperling were fighting it
out on Mineola and Ocean Tide, re
spectively, for second money, which
was won by Mineola. Summary:

Therefore, the appellant. William Davidnon
is hereby notified that his license *m chief

Supervising Inspector John Birm
ingham jesterday ordered a reduction
of the sentence imposed upon William
Davidson, chief engineer of the steam
er Arthur B. by the local board of
inspectors for the district of Seattle
for failing to insert a new fusible plug
in the boiler of said steamer after hav
ing been ordered to do so by Assist
ant Inspector Lord on April 19 of thia
year. The following is an extract from
Captain Bermingham's decision:
On Ausust 16 1904. tlw Supervising In
spector of Steam Vessels, First District, gave
Mr. Uavldson a hearing on appeal. He was
duly sworn, waived counsel and testified that
he remained about five weeks In the Arthur H
after her inspection, without renewing; tha
fusible plug, for the reason that he thought
the o d one was "good enough." He left that
vessel without proper notice to the owner and
without notifying his successor that he had not
renewed the aforesaid fusible plug; wnlch. It
appears, was later the cause of the "coming
down" of the crown sheet ot the boiler in the
above mentioned steamer: but. fortunately no
injury to life resulted therefrom.
Mr. Davidson, by his own admissions ap
pears to be a man of somewhat dissolute
habits, but which he promises to abate. How
ever, i believe that the ends of Justice In his
case will be served by ,tne redaction of one
half the penalty imposed by the local board in
his case.

Three carloads of ore -were reported
by the committee to have been recently
shipped. They showed a value from
the smelter of (1600 a ton and the com
mittee saw 60 sacks, weighing 100
pounds each, ... -"from which they (the
mine owners) expected to realize from
the' pannings over $500 a sack." . At
Tonopah, Goldfields and the other dis
tricts' visited by the committee' there
is sufficient ore td require three times
the present shipping facilities to han
dle. The committee gave as reasons
for the fact that the mines in ques
tion are not dividend payers, lack of
power, water and shipping facilities.
The committee reported that several
mines in Tonopah "were visited. No
attempt was made to furnish any de
tails concerning any or these mines.
Thirty-nine shafts have been sunk in
the district and twenty-three out of
the thirty-nine were reported in pay
ore. "Many of these . have developed
large bodies of very mgh grade ore,"
reported the committee. "Tonopah is
to-day a settled business community
and is destined to be a great mining
center."
Goldfields, Columbia, Diamond Fields
and Jumbo were also visited. Concern
ing the miues the committee reported
that as a whole, considering 1 the extent
of the territory so far prospected, "they
bid fair to be the greatest gold pro
ducers in the country. New finds are
constantly being made of ore with" a
value of $60 or more a ton In gold,
showing that the rich mineralization
is general over a wide area." Whether
these values will extend! in depth the
committee refused to say as "no ona
can see under the ground beyond the
point of a pick." ...
That you should find out, through some rep
resentative sent by you, the condition of the
work belr-r done, and whether they are being
legitimately opened up, and thereby protect the
Investing public.
If the above recommendations are adopted,
Â¦we believe that a new interest will be awakened
and that beneficial results will accrue, not only
to the mining . interest* but also to our ex
change.
A committee of the San Francisco
Stock Exchange consisting of A. B.
Huggles, Joseph Marks and W. C. Ral
ston reported to the exchange yester
day their conclusions concerning the
Tonopah and Goldflelds mining dis
tricts, which they personally visited.
The committee also made recommenda
tions to the exchange In regard to Its
action. The recommenflations, in full,
are as follows:
In view of the foregoing, we, your committee,
beg leave to recommend that many of the
mines in these several districts should be listed
and regularly called upon our exchange.
That you should first, however, obtain from
each of the mining companies a statement
signed by the proper officers of the amount of
their capitalization, the stock already dis
posed of and the amount on hand In the
treasury.
A graduate of some forestry school,
with a certain number of years' ex
perience, is the sort of person that
members of the California Water and
Forest Association wish to have ap
pointed as forester for this State, un
der the terms of a bill to be presented
to the California Legislature at its
next session. A meeting of the com
mittee that was appointed at a recent
conference between the Water and For
est Association's committee and repre
sentatives of the United States For
estry Division to draft a bill to prevent
the further destruction of California
forests by fires will be held next Sun
day. William Thomas is the chairman
of that committee and it will have be
fore it the bill that was recently sub
mitted by the Forestry Division repre
sentatives who have been engaged In
work in this State. In that proposed
measure one clause made the appoint
ment of a forester by the Governor fol
low the recommendation of the For
estry Division.
The purpose of this provision was to
make it certain that no mere politician
should ever be selected to fill a position
that requires some knowledge of for
estry. It was considered certain that
no Governor of California would ever
consent to have a bureau of the na
tional Government select for him a
man to appoint to any State position.
The desirability of having a man with
the indispensable forestry lore led to
turning over the bill to a special com
mittee for amendment to meet existing
conditions. Since then the idea of pro
viding an educational qualification for
the State forester is reported to have
gained ground. There is no demur to
the general suggestions made by the
Governmental forestry attaches. It will
probably be recommended that the fire
wardens be provided for in the bill;
each warden having a specified dis
trict shall be entirely under the control
and direction of the State forester.
Probably the amount asked from the
State as an appropriation in the for
estry bill that has already been con
sidered will be raised from $20,000 by
the special committee to some larger
sum. The compulsory burning of
"slashings" as a preventive measure
against fires is still open to discussion.
Holders of large timber tracts have
said that they approved of promptly
destroying the slashings for the pur
pose of getting the litter that might
feed flames off the ground. Smaller
timber owners may object on account
of. the expense Involved.
Possibly two bills may be reported,
so that if one set' of provisions proves
to be too strongly opposed another set
may be adopted and so make the neces
sary beginning possible. It is now re
ported that there was no need for the
great fire at the Big Basin in Santa
Cruz County lately. Smoldering em
bers were seen a week before the large
conflagration. Parties who passed
seemed to think that the responsibility
belonged to others. The real fact was
that responsibility did not devolve of
ficially on any one.' The appointment
of' a forester and the forest wardens
will make it the duty of paid persons
to watch for incipient fires and to ex
tinguish them as soon as possible, be
fore any destructive headway can be
made.

Movements of Steamers.
The big American Hawaiian freighter
Callfornian, Captain Dow. arrived yes
terday morning, 53 days from New
York, -with a general cargo of over
E000 tons. The steamer had fair weath
er down the Atlantic and hummed
alcmg until fhe was entering the Paci
fic Ocean from the Straits of Magellan,
Neptune in his most "grouty" moods,
to use a sea. term, was evidently wait
ing for the ship and she had hardly
cleared Cape Pillar, at the mouth of
the straits, when he aroused himself
and sot busy. A strong gale from the
northwest suddenly began to whistle
by, with heavy eeas from the west
northwest. The California^ is no
tfainty steam yacht and though she is
leaded to a "steady" point with' cargo,
her rails were 6oon going under with
A Quick jump from starboard to port.
The decks were flooded with water
tvashinr fore and aft with the pitching
of the ship, but as there is not enough
wood about the Californlan to make a
chicken coop, nothing about the decks
could be broken nor torn adrift. The
rreat waves simply piled themselves
on the vessel, washing fore and aft.
and cpllied back Into the sea without
C<Ang any damage. On the second day,
Feptember 10, the hurricane Increased
in violence as If the elements were de
termined to down the stanch craft.
The steamer rolled deeply, laboring and
e training In her struggle with the
mountains of water that hurled them
erlves to the attack. All that day
Captain Dow and his first officer stood
en the bridge, which Is high above the
deckhouses, with the seas at Intervals
joing over their heads. Heavy rain
snd hail storms swept across the ocean.
adding to the general confusion and
dlsagreeableness of the tempest. The
carpenter reported nine feet of water
In the bilge, caused by the violent
straining of the hull and the constant
wash of the seas around and over the
decks. However, the steam pumps
coon cleared this out.
On the seventh day of the straggle
the storm began to moderate and
toward night the gale was blowing
itself out. Wind and wave had pre
vailed not against steel and steam and
the Californlan came out of the tem
pest to float on summer seas till she
entered the Golden Gate. The vessel's
former trip from New York, which was
a fair weather passage, took E8 days
&nd nor arrival in the port was August
:g, 1^03.

Dean Hale, the noted English cler-w

leading figure in many humorous sto
ries. On one occasion he was cross
ing the Channel after a visit to the
continent, the voyage being very
stormy. The dean was a bad sailor
and had suffered a good deal on the
trip. At Dover he was looking over
the railway company's rules on the
station wall as a fellow passenger
came up. Said the dean: "After that
stormy voyage we have at least one
advantage in making the subsequent
trip to London: I see the company
carries returned empties at reduced
rates." â¢

says an editorial in the New York In
dependent, "three more must be add
ed to the list. The battle of Gettys
burg. 1863. 'which decided the destiny
of an enslaved race and secured for
us all liberty and union, now and, as
we hope, forever; the battle of Sedan,
1870, which marked the rise of the
German empire; the destruction of the
Spanish fleet In Manila bay, 1898.
which made the United States the
dominant power of the Pacific Ocean
and marked its entrance into world
politics. And now to these* must be
added the battle of Liaoyanpr. the
first time in the history of the world
the yellow race has driven back the
white; the first serious check in the
conquest of Asia, Africa and America
by Europe; the first time an Asiatic
race has demonstrated its ability to
use the appliances of modern civiliza
tion; the first important battle for
1200 years not fought on both sides
by members of the Aryan race and
professedly Christian nations; the first
decisive engagement in a war for ex
istence by a nation which is already
exerting an influence on all others in
commerce and industry, in art and
science. If Japan finally wins she be
comes the Great Britain of the East,
and the natural leader of the Chinese
and Koreans."
Creasy, in his "Fifteen Decisive Bat
tles of the World," gives the following
and tells why they were decisive:
Marathon, B...C. 490, when Greek
civilization was preserved from an Asi
atic Inundation; the defeat of the
Athenians a*t Syracuse, B. C. 413, by
which Rome instead of Greece be
came the schoolmaster of Europe; the
battle of Arbela, B. C. 331. which ex
tended Greek influence from the Nile
to the Caspian; the battle of the Me
tauros, B. C. 207, which decided be
tween Carthage and Rome; the vic
tory of Armenius over the Roman
legions under Varus, Â«a: D. 9, which
saved our Germanic ancestors from en
slavement or extermination and drew
the line between the Latin and Teu
tonic races; the battle of Chalons, A.
D. 451, when "the Scource of God,"
Attila, and the Huns ceased their af
fliction of Christendom; the battle of
Tours, A. D. 732, when, but for
Charles the Hammer, the Koran would
have been taught at Oxford instead
of the Bible; the battle of Hastings,
1006. when "high-mettled the blood
in our veins"; Joan of Arc's victory
over the English at Orleans, 1429, by
which she "rescued her country from
becoming a second Ireland": the de
feat of the Spanish Armada. 1588,
which checked the sea power of Spain
and saved England from the Inquisi
tion; the battle of Blenheim, 1704,
when Germany was delivered from
Louis XIV; the battle of Pultowa,
1709, when Peter the Great brought
Russia into Europe; the victory of
the Americans, over Burgoyne at Sar
atoga, 1777. by which the New World
was enabled to work out its ovfn des
tinies; !the battle of Valmy, 1792,
which proved the power of the French
republic; the battle of Waterloo. 1815,
which checked the attempt to found
an empire for the aggrandizement of
one man. Â¦ ; : -

Conditions on Isthmus Satisfactory.
NEW YORK, Oct. 5. â John Barrett,
American Minister to Panama, who
has just arrived here from Colon, said
that .conditions on the isthmus are
very satisfactory.
If the test of ability to write a poem
of that excellence were founded on
other poems of at least approximate
Xjerfection, neither Mrs. Beers nor FoÂ«
taine nor Oliver would have any stand
ing In court. Of the three the North
ern ladv best endures that test. The
drivel that Fontaine wrote and is con
ceded to be his excludes him utterly. A
literary gentleman of Georgia, a poet
himself, examined the other verses
composed by Mr. Oliver, and was sat
isfied that only by some intellectual
miracle could he have been the author
of the poem' in dispute.
The case is really narrowed down to
Airs. Beers and Mr. Oliver, both of
whom are dead. We hesitate to doubt
the word of the lady or the soldier, but
one or the other is mistaken. Both
cculd not have written it. Under the
circumstances, if we republished in
book form the poems of the war, we
would in the case of "All Quiet Along
the Potomac" either let it go anony
mously or else put the names of Mrs.
Beers and Hugh Oliver at the bottom
of it as claimants, leaving the public
to take their choice. If Mrs. Beers
wrote it, she has been, in literary rep
utation, grossly wronged. If Hugh Oli
ver wrote it he has been the victim.
We are somewhat in the predicament
of the father who had two sons killed
in the civil war. One was a .Federal
and the other a Confederate. He bur
ied them side by side ana on the tomb
stone had inscribed, "God knows which
was right."â Augusta (Ga.): Chronicle.
The claim of Thaddeus Oliver, a
Georgia Confederate soldier, 'to the
poem, is very ingeniously and circum
stantially worked upâ so much so that
even the late Alexander H. Stephens
gave him the credit.
Lamar Fontaine claimed it, but the
literary critics discard his title, al
though, by a persistent assumption, he
has contrived to get his name tagged
to it and may, in "the sarcasm of des
tiny," hold a right of way that does
not belong to him.
Mrs. Ethel Beers, a Northern lady,
who had written some" clever poetry,
but not up to the high mark of "All
Quiet Along the Potomac To-night,"
claimed the authorship of that poem
and the evidence In her favor Is very
strong.

Following the annual convention of
the American Federation of Labor,
which will assemble in this city on No
vember 14, the International Seamen's
Union of America will hold its annual
convention here in December. The call
convoking the convention has just
been issued by Secretary-Treasurer
William H. Frazier. Each affiliated
union is entitled to one delegate, with
a further representation of one dele
gate' for every 200 members and three
for every 500 or more. [
The same union was enjoined by Su
perior Judge Hebbard yesterday from
boycotting or placing walking pickets
in front of any and all of the places of
business owned by the firm of Gold
berg, Bowen & Co.
This injunction will remain in force
until October 14, when the merits of the
boycott will be heard by Judge Heb
bard. â¢
Judge' Hunt's decision is sweeping,
and it permanently forbade the union
or any member thereof from in any
manner interfering with Pierce or any
of his employes, or with any of the
patrons of the Nevada stables.
The Stablemen's Union has appealed
from the decision Tendered by Superior
Judge Hunt on August 6, restraining
its members from boycotting the Ne
vada stables at 1352 Market street.
Butchers' Union No. 115 met last
evening, but took no direct action re
garding the "open shop" cards which
have been displayed in the majority of
the markets during the week. Im
mediately after the meeting was called
to order a motion that all regular
business be suspended and that the
union resolve itself into a mass meet
ing to discuss vital questions pre
vailed. "While all the speakers thought
that union men should stand together,
the course of the butchers in accept
ing the ukase of the Butchers' Ex
change was generally commended.
Among the speakers at the meeting
were Secretary Wisler of the Labor
Council, D. McLennon, T. C. Zant, O.
M. Tveitmoe and Congressman Liver
nash. Representatives of the Co-op
erative Meat Company were also pres
ent and a number of shares of stock
were subscribed to.
The prevailing sentiment, as ex
pressed last night, is that there will
be no strike. Some of the individual
members say they think their bosses
are endeavoring to induce them to
strike and, in case the strike fails, dis
rupt the union.
The meeting last night was all along
conservative lines. No comDlaint has
been heard of any proprietor of a
shop attempting to increase hours or
reduce wages or employ non-union
men, and so long as this condition
continues the workers were advised to
remain behind their blocks. The open
shop idea was, of course, frowned
upon to, a certain extent, but so long
as if does not directly threaten disas
ter to the organization the members
of the union are satisfied. At the
meetjng of the Labor Council to-night
it is probable that the matter will
come up for further discussion.
The men employed by the W. S. Ray
Manufacturing Company, who went out
on a strike some time ago. have re
turned to their, places of their own vo
lition, without any concessions being
made by their employers.
There is some dissatisfaction re
garding wages among the hands en
gaged in chicken-picking in San Fran
cisco. Dealers say they are ready *to
meet the issue.
The Citizens' Alliance has taken no
tice of the boycott placed on Swain's
restaurant, and has pledged its sup
port to defeat the boycott.
Russians Regularly Defeat Japanese.

Russian correspondent of the Asso

"There have been constantly recur
ring skirmishes in which the Rus

never been very large. The last ad
vance I witnessed was on October 2,
when the Japanese made several ten
tative movements, but were driven
back on every occasion by the Rus
sian cavalry."

Two writs w of attachment were
placed yesterday by Sheriff Curtis on
the Terrace Garden, 123 Mason street.
The writs were served at the instance
of H. Grundel to cover a claim of
51254 80, and by the Rauer Collection
Company for $299 99.
The attachments are the outcome of
some business transactions. The trou
ble was Immediately adjusted, so the
new cafe was not closed up. Prosper
P. Reiter, manager of the Terrace
Garden, when seen last night said:
"The statement made in this evening's
papers that the Terrace Garden has
been- attached and closed by the
Sheriff's office is untrue. Though an
attachment was served on us this aft
ernoon the Terrace restaurant is not
closed, nor Is there any probability of
its closing."

When trading in the wheat pit began senti

influences mainly responsible for the slight de

ing a material Increase in the acreage sown
with winter wheat. The condition of this new
ly sown wheat was said, moreover, to be first
class as a result of recent favorable weather.

delivery from commission houses. The advance
in prices, however, was Email, May selling up
to $1 11% and December to Jl 11%. A reac
tion soon occurred on scattered selling. During
the remainder of the day the tendency was
toward a lower level. The downward trend
was given momentum by figures showing an
Increase in primary receipts for the day
amounting to 33 per cent compared with those
for the corresponding day a year ago. Extreme
weakness of corn had a depressing influence on
the wheat market. As the day advanced the
selling became general, many stop- loss orders
coming out on the decline. The low point of
the day for December was at $1 09% and for
May at ?1 09%. The demand improved consid
erably during the last few minutes of trading,
a report of good flour sales at Minneapolis fur
nishing the stimulus to buying. The market,
however, closed weak, with December at
$1 ttn-%. Final quotations on May were at
|1 09%Â®|l 10.
A fear that the Government crop report due
Monday will indicate a big yield caused gen
eral liquidation ' of corn. A Cincinnati trade
Journal estimated the total" yield at 2.400,000,
000 bushels. The market broke severely. De
cember closed l%@t%c lower at 49 %c.
In sympathy with the weakness of other
grains the oats market was subjected to' con
siderable selling pressure. December closed
%c lower at 30%c.
The decline in corn had a weakening influ
ence on provisions, but covering of January
lard by shorts nearly offset this bear factor.
At the close January pork was oft 2%G5c, lard
was up 7%c and ribe were unchanged.

The testimony was to the effect that
Reed had been acting, as motorman
for about six months; that in order to
check the great speed of the car as
it. was approaching the curve he put
on the rail brake, which brought the
car to a sudden stop and jolted from
the dummy the two men who were
killed. A large number of the 100
passengers on the car were injured.
It appeared also that the car on which
the accident occurred was one of the
old style with hand brakes instead of
air brakes and had been put in service
by the company to assist in handling
the large crowds frequenting the park
and ocean beach on Sundays. It was
the Impression among the Jurors that
if the motorman had not used the
rail brake the accident would not
have occurred. * ; â¢ -â¢
The motorman accused by the jury of
being an "incompetent employe" was
Is. G. Reed. The conductor was E. A.
Kelly.
â¢We recommend that -legislation be enacted
requiring- the substitution of gate cars for the
so-called open end cars on alh electric lines,
and that all street cars, both electric and ca
ble, be equipped with modern air brakes.
The United Railroads is held respon
sible by a Coroner's Jury for the car
accident at Eighth avenue and Clement
street last Sunday, in which two men
were killed and many persons badly
Injured. The inquest on the bodies of
Frederick Finsten and Harry Curran
was held yesterday and the following
verdict was rendered:
We further find that said Harry Curran and
Fred. FinMen came to their, death owing to
the car upon which they rodo being operated
by an incompetent employe of the United
Railway Company; that such employe's ex
perience, had been too brief to enable him to
safely handf<> a car crowded to over its gate
capacity, and we hold the United Railway
Company responsible for the- accident.

Divorces were granted yesterday by
HUSBAND A DIGAMIST.
After a hearing occupying the entire
afternoon in Judge Graham's court yes
terday a divorce was granted to Ada
M. Wood from John R. Wood, paying
teller, of the Crocker- Woolworth Na
tional Bank, on the ground of infidelity.
C. W. Durbrow represented the plain
tiff, and Wood's case was conducted by
Charles J. Heggerty.
Mrs. Wood testified that she had
found three letters from Mrs. Tyler in
Mr. Wood's trousers pocket, and be
cause of their contents she left their
home in Mill Valley and came here to
live with her parents. The epistles were
read in court and were futl^of endear
ing terms.
The testimony of John E. Powers,
special agent for the North Shore Rail
road, and of S. W. Churchill, a clerk
for the H.S. Crocker Company, was
based upon observations made by them
through a transom of a room adjoining
the one occupied by the teller and his
companion at the Commercial Hotel on
various dates in June.
Wood was examined only as to the
condition of his finances. He said he
had lost his position in June because
of the notoriety arising from the di
vorce action, and was taken back in
the bank's employ in September at a
salary of $150 instead of $275, which he
had received before, though he is now
performing the same duties. His home
in Mill Valley, he said, was sold for a
debt and he has no property. His evi
dence regarding the discharge from the
bank was corroborated by Cashier
George W. Kline and the deposition of
Assistant Cashier Wellington Gregg.
The court ordered that Mrs. Wood
should be paid $50 a month alimony,
$150 counsel fees and $50 costs.
NO DIVORCE FROM THE DEAD.
Judge Hebbard yesterday set
aside the interlocutory and absolute
decrees of divorce ordered* entered by
himself in the case of Amy E. Grace
against Joseph H. Grace. The defend
ant in the case died on August 22 last,
and on September 14 Leon Samuels,
! representing the mother and sister of
the dead husband in the probate court,
moved that the decrees be entered, his
purpose being to shut the wife out from
participating in the $3000 estate.
Mrs. Grace was granted an interloc
utory decree of divorce on the ground
of cruelty on May 20, 1303, but for some
reason the decree was never entered in
the clerk's office. Samuels obtained the
order for an entry of the interlocutory,
nunc pro tune and for the entry of the
final decree more than three weeks
after. the defendant's death! The cir
cumstances were called to Judge Heb
bard's notice by Mrs. Grace's motion to
have the decrees set aside, saying that
her desires had not been consulted. In
his written opinion the Judge says:
"There is no law that compels the
plaintiff in a divorce case to obtain a
decree when she does not desire it, and
i particularly in a case where the de
! fendant has died prior to the* entry
thereof. Divorce proceedings interest
only the plaintiff, the "defendant and
the State of California. Interference
by any one else will not be tolerated by
the court."
Judge Kerrigan yesterday granted a
divorce to Flora Karlson from David
Karlson, who owns second hand furni
ture stores on Mission and Market
streets. She charged him with assault
ing her with chairs, iron bars and other
weapons and said that he only allowed
her fifty cents a day for the purchase
of food. Karlson entered a general de
nial of the accusations tnrough his at
torney, Julius Kahn, but did not ap
pear in court to oppose the case.

A last opportunity will be given this
afternoon to aid in swelling the teach
ers' annuity and benefit fund. When
the gates of the Chutes close this
evening they will close on one of the
most successful enterprises ever
launched in behalf of a worthy cause.
A merry crowd filled the grounds all
week, and those who came to aid the
teachers left carrying away none but
happy recollections. # It is hoped
that to-day will be the banner day of
the week, and there is an excellent
programme arranged.
The chief attraction will be in the
main theater, where the Columbia
Park Boys' Club, under the direction
of Sidney S. Peixotto, will give an
old-time minstrel show. Any one who
has seen these clever chaps on thfc
stage will appreciate the treat in store
for them. They sing well, dance well,
can carry on witty dialogue and do
all not with an air of professionalism,
but as though they were out for a
good time and honestly - enjoying
themselves. The entertainment will
conclude with the farce, "Skinner's
Hotel, Tallapoosa, Florida." Many
vaudeville novelties will be intro
duced.
The leaden skies yesterday morning
caused gloomy forebodings in the
minds of many, but early in the after
noon the children and "grown-ups"
began arriving by the carload. The
theater was filled half an hdur before
the curtain raised on the first act of
"The Princess Fan Tan," and when
the show began there was hardly \ a
vacant seat in the house. The per
formance was ..very creditable.
Those who packed the theater, how
ever, could hardly be missed from the
grounds, as everywhere were seen
jolly groups of children. While the
teachers -hope the .weather will re
main clear, a little rain would not
be a serious drawback, as the portion
of the grounds under cover is suffi
ciently large to accommodate even a
larger crowd than that present on the
first day. Sunshine would be wel
come, however, as it helps to instil
gladness, but the pavilion, the theater
and the numerous side attractions will
accommodate all.
It was estimated that at least S000
people passed through the gates yes
terday. All the attractions were well
patronized and every one appeared to
be happy.
The post-nuptial trip of Thomas F.
McDermott and hi? pretty bride,
whose marriage ceremony was elab
orately solemnized at St. Mary f s Ca
thedral Tuesday evening, was rudely
Interrupted early yesterday a few
miles this side of San Jose. The young

ostensibly for Los Angeles. Shortly
after the train pulled out of the depot
the conductor proceeded through" the
cars for an inspection of tickets and
finally reached the coach where Mc-
Dermott and his bride were convers
ing. When McDermott handed up his
tickets the conductor scrutinized them
carefully and finally asked their own
er to duplicate on a slip of paper thÂ«?
signature which the transportation
coupon bore.
The lack of similarity in the signa
tures did not .satisfy .the conductor,
for h*> quietly invited McDermott to
the rear of the coach, where they had
a stormy interview. Which, however,
finally ended by the conductor's con
fiscating the tickets and forcing the
young groom to get off at. San Jose
and purchase local tickets to Los An
geles.
According to : the records of the
Southern Pacific Company the tickets
properly belonged to Robert Brown
of Denver, who purchased them dur
ing the Knights Templar conclave.
They called for a round trip to Los
Angeles by way of this city. Arriving
here Brown abandoned the idea of go
ing to Los Angeles and so. McDermott
avers, proposed to him that he and
his bride use that portion of the tick
rts between here and Los Angeles.
They accepted the proposition and
npreed to return to Brown the balance
of the ticket when they returned from
the south. Unfortunately for the Mc-
Dermotts and Brown, the train con
ductor easily detected McDermott's
attempt to imitate Brown's signature
and spoiled the groom's economical
plans for a. free trip to Los Angeles.
As a result of Brown's well meant
intention? the railroad company now
holds his tickets, the agreement upon
â¢which he violated, and the prospects
are that if he concludes to return to
Denver he will have to pay another
fare.

People are beginning to realize more
and more each year that improved condi
tions of Shoe manufacture mean better
Footwear at decreased prices. A number
of years ago a strong prejudice existed
against all Shoes that sold at $3.50 and
under. No one believed then that de
pendable Shoes could be marketed at
$2.50 and $3.00. Public opinion has
changed. The $2.50 and $3.00 Shoe is
destined, without question, to become the
popular Shoe of the future. We know It.
