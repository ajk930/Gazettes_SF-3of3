cither widower or bachelor, and at that,
coupled with his having taken a , large
house, the hope crept about that in the
season he would entertain. The -latter
thought addressed itself tenderly to the
local appetite, which was ready to be re
ceived wherever there abode good' cooks
and sound wines. Mr. Gwynn, it should
be mentioned, was duly elected a member
of the Metropolitan Clubâ where he never
went; as was likewise Richardâ who was
seen there a great deal.
Richard had not come to town until both
Mr. Gwynn and his house were estab
lished. When -he did appear it was diffi
cult for the public to fix him in his proper
place. He was reserved and icily taciturn,
and that did not blandly set his moderate
years; with no friends and few acquaint
ances, h* seemed to prefer his own so
ciety to that of whomsoever came about
"What was he? â¢
What were his relations with Mr.
Gwynn?
Surely, Richard could be neither son
nor nephew of , that English gentleman.
Richard was too obviously the American
of full blood; his high cheek-bones, square
Jaw, and lean, curved nose told of two
\u25a0centuries of Western lineage. Couldtit.
be that Richard was Mr. Gwynn's secre
tary? This looked in no wise probable;
he wenÂ£*about too much at lordly ease for
that. In the end, the notion obtained that
Richard must be a needy dependent of
Mr. Gwynn, and his perfect clothes and
the thoroughbred horse* he rods were
pointed to as .evidences' of that-; gentle
man's, generosity,' \u25a0'-' Indeed, - Mr. .' ' Gwynn
was; much profited , in . reputation' thereby."
Richard,, while hot known, was ' not
liked, , f He/worepthe. air.* of onÂ© â¢ self-cen- <*
tered, \ and cold : to Judgments ;
his own. This last; makes no* friends," but*
only enemies 'for/* him" whose -'position ris
problematical. ..' Richard's pose of insolent
indifference would have been beautiful in
a" .gentleman .who) counted his ' fortune ;byj.'
'millions;' In a*dollarless beggar .who': lived
alms s it' '.. was . detestable. -Where
\u25a0fore, the town,, co far as Richard encoun
tered it. left : our Eilent, supercilious; one -
â¢to himself, which neglect dovetailed with'
his humor ' and ( was the , precise - lonely
thing he sought. This gave, still further
edge, to the : public's disregard;, no. one
likes you' to accept with" grace what jis
Intended for. punishment.
' Matzal' carried away the breakfast. tray,
and Richard lighted a cigar. Matzal, to-;
turned and stood mute inside* the door,
awaiting new commands. Richard pointed
.through the 'cigar, smoke to the /clockâ
'one of those soundless,' curious creatures
of brass and \ glass and ivory which is
wound but once in 400 days, and of which
the hair-hung pendulum twists and turns
and does not swing. ' '
"In an hour! .Eleven o'clock!" said -.
Richard.
At the risk of shaking him In general
standing it should be called to your notice â¢
that Richard preceded breakfast with no
strong 1 waters. Richard would drink noth
ing more generous than coffee, " amC
speaking in the sense limited, tobacco was
his only vice.; Perhaps he stuck- to ci-.
gars to retain hi* hold on earth,- and
avoid translation before his -our was
ripe.
It was no pale"; morality that . got be
tween Richard and*tbe; wine' cup. In an
other day at college he had' emptied many.
But early in Ills ;, twenties, â¢ Richard - dis
covered* that he carried his drink uneasi
ly; It gave a Gothic cant, to his spirit.'
whiqh, under its warm spell,'. turned war
â¢llke. Once, having eat late at ' -dinnerâ .
:'this was in that Eeminary town In France
where he attended schoolâ he. bestrode v a
certain iron j lion, \ the -same strange j to
him and guarding the portals of a publlo
building. Being thus happily: placed,' he
drew two huge American 'six-shooters,'
whereof his possession was wrapped in
mystery even to himself, and blazed vac
uously, yet; ferociously, at the moon.
Spoken to by the constabulary who camÂ©
flying to the spot, Richard replied with
"acrimony. â¢ . . .
-" "If you interfere; with me," .remarked.
Richard . on that explosive * occasion, . ad
dressing tho French constables, "I'll buy
your town and burn 1 it." Tta last; with
a splendid disdain of limitations that was
congenital. V ...... \u2666 \u25a0'. \u25a0 .'Â» .-\u25a0'â¢"\u25a0-
Exploits similar to . the above' taught
Richard; the futility of â¢' alcoholic '.thirigi,'
and thereupon he cultivated a Purl tan" so
briety upon ; coffee \u25a0 and â¢tobaccoÂ» > /';l' 'j^r
Richard cast ths half-burned cigar Into
the flre. Steppingltothe mantel, he" took f^
from it. a small: metal casket, bullded to
hold Jewels. What should ; be ' ttf oseVgems V
of price which: the; metal box; protected? '
Richard did not strike oho as, the man to ; ;
nurse a weakness for barbaric adornment. v ;
A ] bathrobe ; is : "not a . costume calculated
to teach one the wearer's fineness. To say
best, a' bathrobe is but a savage" thlngi It .
is the garb most likely, to obscure and set
backward even "a ', WalpoleVor a
field in any \u25a0 Impression of \u25a0'gentility. >. \ln
spite of this' primitive' regalia, however/ *
Richard gave i forth i an; ldea of 'eleyatldn;^

was a little klssable 'Heel, ... elegant in

aforetime to the footwear of a", beautiful
girl. Perhaps this thought; was aided; by
the reverent preoccupation. of Richard as
he regarded ; it, for he set the â¢ boot heel

Rlqhard shook' off his bathrobe skin and
shone forth in a sleeveless undershirt and
a pair of those cottoa trousers, cut short
above the knee,' which dramatic usage
ascribes to fUberinen and -buccaneers.
"As" Richard "stood erect,- shoulders *ide
as a viking's' chest 'arched like the .deck

model for the Fafnese. Hepcule?, if ', that
demigod were slimmed down by Irainlng

should . be about j lorty. if one may go

have been -out of drawing . from . stand

Ricliard's htad : â¢if was not that riubbfn

asked Mr.. Gwynn.
"Their letter addressed to youâ here It '

"Very good, sJr," and Mr. Gwynn bowed,
deeply.
Richard rulled on his gloves to depart,
whereat Mr. Pickwick yelped frantically
irons his cushion.. Richard tapped Mr.
PicUwick with- the iacauered rattan.
"Old map," said Richard, "I am going
to take a look at the lady I love." Mr.
Piekwlck moaned querulously, while
Richard sought the street.
" Richard, the day before, dispatched a
note and a card to Mrs. Hanwav-Harley
and had been told in reply that he 'might
call to"-day at three. Richard decided to
re-pair. to the dub and wait for three
o'clock. ;
RJchard,. during his week in Wash
ington, had fpund a deserted corner
in the club and pre-empted iL At those
times when he honored the dub with
his presence he occupied this vantage
point. From it he was given both a view
of th.c stj-e^t and a fair survey of the
apartment Itself. ,' No "one approached
him; his atmosphere was fepellant; be
yond- civil nods, curtailed to - the last
limit of civility, his intercourse with his
fellows had not advanced.
On this afternoon as Richard smoked
a solitary cigar and reviewed* the t. thin
procession "Of foot * passengers , trudging
through the snow . beneath his window,
'he -was attracted ; by, the loud talk of a
6oterle abo'ura "tattler 'The center'pf the
" group" was**** <j'ount**"Sto'friâ a"*gia'nt'.' Russ.
This Storri did not belons to the Russian
legation, did riot indeed reside in town.
_and ha^'been/ vouched. Into trte^ club by
one t of .his cQuntrymen. vHe ' had< onyx

lie/was at the moment telling a
knot of gaping youngsters* of monstrous
deeds of strength. ; Storri â¢ had en'shed
horEeshoca In his hand;; he had rolled
.silver pieces into bullets between thumb
and flnser.
"See, you children, I will show what a
Russian pan do." cried Storri.
Stcrri came over to the' firenlace, the
rest at his heels! Taking up the poksrâ
a round - half-inch / rod "of : ;wrpught

, The youngsters'' stared wonder-bitten.
Then a mighty chatter of compliments
broke .forth, and Storri swelled with
the I savage glory of his achievement. 7 \u25a0
. Richard, the somber, who did not like
noise, shrugged'; his shqulQers. Stprri,"
by the fireplace, : caught the shruff and
found It ofrensive. He .made ' toward
Richard, and offered the rjght hand, his
white teeth gleaming In a sinister way
through the -fastnesses of his beard. ;.
"Will you try grips j with me?" cried
Storri loudly. .â¢ "Will you j shake- hands
Russian fashion?" * '*/ .
"No," retorted Richard, all Jce and
unconcern. : "I will npt shake your
hand Russian fa'shibn.'V /Â«//âÂ£'
â¢ Storri broke . Into an evil grin that
made" hjm look iik'e a blaok panther.'
''Some, day. you must. put your fingers
into "that, trap,"' said he, opening arid
'closing his broad hand. -
-. Ric|iard maki'n^.no return." Storrl-and
the other^ went back to their. decanters.'
"\u25a0' Rlchard/.mif?ht have said/and would

Storri, because of a Siberjan ruderie'ss

caller at the Harley house, it .seemed,"
â¢ and , rumor gave. 1 it that /he \u25a0 and Mr.

ing but /two blocks.
In the Harley drawingrroom whom
should Richard meet- but Storri? The
Rijss was on the brink of departure.
At tho t meeting Richard's, face clpuded.
Dorothy was alone with /Starri;.'; her
mother had been: called, temporarily
irom the room. At sight of^Dorpthy's
flo'werrl ike hand in Storrl's hairy :paw, :
Richard's" eyes turned jade.
"Mr. Storms," â¢ Baid' Dorothy, as Rich:
ard paused In the door, "permit^me/to
present Count Sto.fri."
"Ah!" whispered Storri, beneath his
breath, "see now how my' word comes
true!"'
With that he put out his hand like
a threat.
Storri's exultation fell frost-nipped
in greenest bud.' It was as; though
some Implacable destiny had, seized [his'
hand. In vain did Stprri;put forth.^iis
last resource of. strengthâ he who
ci-ushed horseshoes and twisted pokers!
Like things of steel Richard's 'fingers;
closed grimly and invincibly upon those
of Storrl. The; Russian /strove to fe T
coyer his hand; against the awful forco
that held him his boasted strength was
as the strength of chlldrpn. .
Storri looked into Richard's- eyesf
they were }ess ferocious, "but Jnflniteiy
more reienUess than his own. There
was that, too, in the other's look which'
appalled the Tartar soul . of ; Storri^r
spmCthlng in the drawn brow, the eye
like sgate, the Jaw as iron as the
hand! And ever. more "and a little more 1
thai fearful grip came' grinding. The
onyx eyes glared =; in terror; j; the torÂ«
tured forehead, white as ] paper, became
epaligled with ' drops \ of^ ' sweat?}. -
There afose;';a.Â» smothered feline
screech as from. a: tiger whose back is
broken in a dcadrfall. 'I. Richard /-"gave
his wrist the shadow of a twist, ; and
Storri fell on one knee. ; Then," as
though it "were some foul thing^ Rich
ard tossed aside Storri's hand, from ' the
nails of which blood came, oozing lii
black drops as large as grapes.
."What is - it?"- gasped Dorothy,, who
stood throughout the duel like /one
planet-struck; "what was it you dhl?*'.
\u25a0'Storri on his knee?" asked: Richard

â¢ Senator! Hanway's reading of Vice Pjes
' idential powers was right, as even the "op
position confessed./ He, saved the Senate
and thereby, the- nation, to his party, and
his rule was : established unchallenged
over her people, his: least .opinion becom
ing their, cloud and their pillar of fire to
guide them day and: night. He was made
far/and away the dominant figure of the
Senate. \u25a0 . â¢ â¢
Finding himself thus loftily situated and
his hands so clothed. with power. Senator
Hanway,' looking* over; the -plains -'of -na
tional^ political conceived ' the hour ripe
for another 'and a last step upward: For
twelve years a White House had been his
dream; now he resolved* to seek *hls reali
zation. / From / the Senate he would , move
to^a, Presidency; /a double term .should
close his "career, where/Washington and
Jefferson r and 3 Jackson/ arid fpther /great
ones of the past closed theirs." . '
True, Senator 1 Hanway " must win his
party's nomination, arid it was here he
took counsel with** his Senate colleagues.
Being consulted, th? 1 word of those grave
ones proved ",the very climax of flattery!
Senators Vice arid Price and Dice arid Ice,
and \u25a0" Stuff : and Bluff and Gruff and Muff,
and Loot' "and Coot and Hoot and Toot,
and Wink and Blink and Drink and Kink
â Btatesmen'all 'and of j enow-capne.d emi
nence in the topography, of partyr-indorsed
Senator* Hanway's ambition 'without a
wrinkle of distrust to' max '.their brows :
or a moment "lost in weighing' the pro-;
posal. H The : Senate became: arHanway
propaganda. Even the opposition; so far
as 'slightly lay with them, were pleasantly
willing to help the work along, and Sen
ator Hanway blushed to find- himself a
Senate idol. By, the encouragement which â¢
his colleagues gave him, and the generous
light of it, Senator Hanway sawthe way
clear. to become the choice of his party's
national convention. But. he. must .work.
It was in that prior, day when Senatqr
Hanway served his State in the legisla
ture that he wedded 'Dorothy /Harley..,
It is to -be assumed that he loved her
dearly; for twelve years" later when she
died his grief was like a storm,; and for,
the rest of -his days he would . as soon
think; of a. top hat wlthout/aTcrown as
without a' mourning band.
When Senator ; Hanway married Doro
thy. Harley, 'her, brother, John / Harley,
married Barbara Hanway. Whether this
exchange of slaters by the two was meant
for retort or \l or compliment lived a point
of without being, settledâ among
the friends of the high* con tracting parties
for. many, Vmany ; months */
"N6t{.'.that ;any ' one * suffered^, by .these
double nuptials; the families owned equal
social standing, \u25a0 having none at all, and
were "evenly ;in fortune, since
neither; ha'd= adbllar. Both Senator Han
way and John Harley had .their fortunes
to make \when, "each with the other's

':'\u25a0 It is possible that John Haxlfy's near

to do \u25a0 with founding/ for him i a" railway

/The last was '.evidenced \u25a0\u25a0 on */ day when

'They were buying five millions of tons
, a year, those five millions/ finding their
the sea over .the railway of which
John Harley was a director and in which
he owned those sheaves iof stocks, and
a fortune rose or fell by. that refusal."
The steamboats said they would ha*,-o no
more Harley coal; tt was stones and
slates, they said.- :i , â¢ *
Senator Hanway at once Introduced a
bill, with, every chance of its passage,
which provided for a tariff reduction of
ten per cent ad valorem on goods brought
to this "country in American ships. Since
the recalcitrant nineteen were, to the
lust rebellionlst among " them/ . foreign
: ships, flying lallen flags, fhls threatened
preference of American ships took 'away
their breath. The owners' of those lines
went black with rage; -however, their anÂ«
gerVdld'not so obscure themnbut'what
they saw their "/penitent way to re
adopt the Harley coal, and with that the
mining and carriage and sale of those
annual five millions went forward as be
fore. The. Han way bill, which promised
such American. | advantages, perished in
the pigeon holes of the committee, but
not before the press of the country had
time to ring with' the patriotism ot Sen
ator Hanway/ and praise that long-head
ed statesmanship* which was about to
build up a Yankee merchant .marine with
out-, committing, the crime "of : subsidy."
. John Harley . and Senator Hanway at
the : time, when Dorothy suffered" that
momentous mishap .of the herl were both
enrolled by 'popular opinion among t&e
country's millionaires. Each 'had been
the frequent , subject of .articles in the
magazines, recounting .his achievements
and. offering him to the youth. of Ameri
ca as "a" "Self -made Man, V .whose example
It "would be wise to steer by. In. the
Presidential 'plans of Senator Hanway,
John Harley nourished a flaming inter
est. With his pale brother-in-law in the
White House, what should better, match
the genius of John Harley than the rolÂ»
of Warwick. Jte would pose as a Presl-i
dent-maker/ When the President was
made*, arid- the world was saying "Presi
dent'Hanway/-''that man should be dull.
Indeed, who did not look upon John Har
ley as I the aower behind the curtain: He
would control the backstairs; he""would
wear a White Hoftse pass key as a wa,tch
Charm!, John Harley as well -as Sena*
tor'Hanway had" his" dreams. "
Both Dorothy and her mother were
profound \u25a0 partisans of Senator Hanway.
Dorothy loved her "Uncle. Pa Was much
as she loved her : father. Dorothy, who
could/welgh ft rjvbmanâ being of the sex
might have-felt- occasional misgivings as :.:.
to her. mother,. -rShe might now- juad.sigain
observe an' insufflciency that -was almost
the ''"deficient. â¢ - But*, of. her \u25a0 father .and
vUncle Pat", she never .'possessed a doubt; â¢
the. one was the best and the other, the \u25a0
greatest : of/.' men. â¢ .#. # ;
. Dorothy^was so far justified In her af-.
fection that to /both "John "Harley and.
Senator Hanway she stbod'f or jthe model
of all that was good- and beautiful In
life, r Hard and keen and never honest
with", the. world at large,: the,, love of *
those two for the girl Dorothy was gold
itse,lf. ./Neither said "No" Uo Dorothy,
and neither ihade a dollaf without think-,
ing hbw r one"day it would go \u25a0 to ' herl .
She "was the Joiijt darling; \u25a0 they ' would .
divide- her; between* them "as the* re
cipient of \u25a0 their , loves while they - lived' :
and j their, fortunes when- they. died. And .
many "thought ' Dorothy lucky with* two ;*
such \u25a0 fathers to ' cherish " her, two such -
men â¢to conquer * wealth wherewith to
f eather-llne * her future. \
John 'Harley made no secret of Senator
Hanway! s \u25a0- Presidential prospects, and if
he flid'not talk them over, with hts help
meet'he listened while . she talked ; them

saw and said : thl3 â¢ hersÂ«lf. The Harley *
family would . rnqye to the White .House.
Anything * short ;of that would be pre-:
postcrous. |Iw4>S9pÃÃ3wl
Under-such conditions and facing suqh
a future, the, tremendous responsibilities
of which already feast "their shadow "on
her, ."Jlrs. Hanway-Harley was driven to
take an . interest In her brothers. can- \u25a0
vais, and she took it She gave her hus
band. John Harley, all . sorts iof < advice,
and however much It might. fail In qual
ity, no one would have said that in the
matter of quantity Mrs." Hanway-Harley
did not heap tho- measure high. Senator
Hanway \u25a0himself, she was not so ready to
approach.' He never mentioned the ques
tion; of his Presidential hopes and fears,
holding to the ~ position ~of one, who Is
sought.- Under the circumstances Mrs.
HanwayrHarley felt that It .would be
gross , arid 4 forward .to * force " the â¢; subject
with her r br other," although she was '.cer
tain that- her ; silence meant unmeasured
loss \u25a0to ' him. ' MrsJ ; Hanway-Haxley was

" "Barbara," r said/ Senator Hanway, on

"Barbara; there > la, a matter* fn which

"a little after 8 o'clock in the morning,

'Must Â« month ago" to-day ,T then he
was whole and sound and strong,- this
ydnn* man of 52," with a young wife and
little month-old baby to work for. and he
was looking forward buoyantly tt> a life
of activity, and usefulness and -of hosor
to the calling he loves. . # ' *
Up to that moment. * a little, after 3
o'clock to the cold, dask morning, all- was
well and fighting fires was the finest
â¢port to the world". "
= He had been fighting fires for eleven
years, for he "signed Into the fire de-*
pertinent" wljen he was only 21, and
never one* In all that time was he hurt
He had not been a laggard In his workâ
a "sidewalk fireman." He had taken the
as- they came, always seeing
them, always on the lookout for them,^
never dodging, never shirking, and for
his gallantry and readiness he had been
. rewarded. â¢ After four years of service In
the fire 1 department he was made assist
ant foreman, and In 1900 he was made
lieutenant. From that stepping-stone ho
was looking .forward eagerly to the honor
of a captaincy, to bÂ© won ; by the very
best cervices be could give. He had his /
career all mapped out and It looked very *
good to him. .
That was a month ago, and to-day he
leans his crutches against the wall, his
habit of Ferving himself unbroken by^hls
Illness, and sits in the easy chair in the
sunny bow window, a young man maimed,
his activity gone,*his usefulness in his bo
loved calling ended, his hope of progress"
and promotion shattered.
But not embittered.
"It might have been worse," he says.
"I might have been out there on L<ohe
Mountain."
It is not a cant phrase as he says it/ A
brave man Is nearly always a tender one,
and as his eyes travel over the pleasant
room, made gay- for him. and his. ear
catches the stir -of the young wife busy
with her household duties, and the fee
ble voice of the baby demanding atten-i
tion, it is' not hard to see how much bet- :
ter this "seems* than what might have
beenâ how heartfelt gratitude fills .the .;;
that might have rankled with re- \u0084

the thread of the story of "how the tMng
' happened," **wbeh the alarm ran? in,
and we went right out" on it. Engine 28
" was there already and had a line in, and
I looked for the best place to get in an
other line.
"No, nobody ordered me in. That
doesn't happen at fires. way. we go
"in Is an understood thing. The captain
takes first line in, and the 1 lieutenant
. the second. You can't stand around wait
ing for orders. You have to get right In
and do what you &cc ought to be done.
"Well, my partner, Arata, and I took
our line ln, and everything looked all
right to us. A fireman doesn't go in
where there appears to be danger unless,
of course, there's a reason for it. like
getting somebody out: but he can't be
looking-for safe places. He has to take
hfe chances.
"Things looked ajl right when we 'took
our- line in, and we were . working away
â¢ when all of a sudden, without any warn
ing, the wall that fell gave way and fell
toward us. If It had gone the other way
the men of Engine 28 would have got it;
but it came 'bur way. Just why it gave
way nobody knows, even now. It must
'â¢have had a weak spot in it. Well, any
way". It came all of a sudden and., with/ a
.crash. My partner, Arata, was caught
between two beamsâ that's what saved
his life, although he was hurtâ and I was
caught under that big beam, a twelve-by-.
sixteen. It caught my leg right there,"
marking the place, a "hand's width below.
. the 'stump, "and. it splintered where it
struck me.
"We were caught about 4 o'clockâ a lit
tle after. It was still dark, "it didn't look.
.to. me as If I would get out. ' >"'
"That's what the others thought, too",
" 'When they came to get us out.
"Lieutenant Everson. came in to see
what could be done. He was the one who
.put me onâ that is. I went into the de
partment under himâ and when he saw
meâ how I was fixed â he came over and
put his- arms around me and broke right
dow^i and cried."
. -For a little 'moment the story doesn't
go on. . N
Lieutenant Harrison Is living over
again that scene of proven friendship,
end he -isn'-t quite sure of his /voice, and
"I am ; thinking of those two strong men'
â¢ oom/ortlng each other ln the. darkness
I and. the danger.
â¢ "Everson m.easured the distance from
.where I lay tp the door, and he saw they.
couldn't get me out that way. He thought
and. l thought that the only way was by
â¢working through the roof. You see, the
floor above was 'stored w|th packing
boxes, and the roof was above that," and
'the whole] thing was- liable to come In.
on me. '
"So they went to work cutting In from
the top x They had to move the packing
boxesâ passed them along from, man to
man and cot them but.' And then they
had to bore and cut their .â way through.
They had to be pretty careful to keep the
whole thing from coming down on me."

"And your partner, Arata?"
. "Well, you see. he wasn't pinned

"And tbe fire was burning?" -
"Yes, and the men were working* on
it, of course; keeping it baclc^"
"From you?" * â' .
"Yes;i that was one of. the troubles..
They' couldn't play a big stream- for '
fear of drowning me, and they had to :'
play a little one, and I had to keep
telling them where. As it was, my leg
â the one that was pinned down- â was
â¢ all blistered and* burned . around 'â¢ the
foot and ankle and along the side
where the fire: got. at it.""
"And they had to keep the water on
to keep you from being burned to
death r*
"Yes, and they had .to be careful
about the water to keep me from
being drowned. As it was a stream
so thick," And he measures a cir
cle with the thumbs and fingers of
both hands, "was kept running \u25a0 almost
across- my mouth. , To keep out ' of the
, water I propped myself: with my el

sition all the time. It was a dreadful
strain." â¢ ( V' .'; ...
So much of a strain that when > he

found raeped raw. and bleeding."
There was- danger of/.' suffocation
from the ; smoke, , there was danger of
.drowning, from ; the : water that. had to
be played"- in, there: was. danger;sof
death from the cruel, creeping fire,:
there' was * danger, of being crushed \by
the caving- in of the heavily laden 1 floor
and weakened roof above "him, : there
â¢was .'danger of -being ; burled beneath
v the bricks of 'the weakenedj. threat

: all \ Dave Harrison lay there -the five
long hours without ever, crying out to
his comrades: v ' > '
" "Save me! \u25a0 Save ME!".
\u25a0' , . Through it all he lay there, black
\u25a0 ened; with smoke" arid grime, . soaked. to
the skin and shivering-, the^heavy beam
- pressing: upon \u25a0 the splintered ' bones and
lacerated flesh - of . his : ; leg, ' the " fire
gnawing at foot and ankle, yet calmer
than the^meh who were i working :- to
save him. .
Calmer, perhaps, because -.they .were
working with the frenzied fear and
pity of comrades' love 'for the ;; brave
fellow. Calmer because every thought
ful, patient word he said to them, beg
ging them to leave him and not risk
their own lives for him, made their
hearts in their throats choke them, and
the tears wash little/rivulets ; through
the grime -on their blackened cheeks. V
When things looked at their worst/
he said: - â¢ ;
"Don't try to get me out, boys. Let
inc . alQne. I'm ' only one', man. . There's
no need of more lives to be lost."
When the fire 'was eating its way.
in here and (there he told them where;
to fight it back' ho being; on, the In
sideand at _a : point of vantage. "
\u25a0When the . men. above were cutting,
their way 'through he toldr them the
weak places to 'a void, and warned : thorn

When .they 'wore, sawing the big
.beam throughâ the last of. the work of

was. hurt." , . â¢\u25a0
When they had sawed, the beam
through,- and quick, ready hands were
slipped "under" arras .'and shoulders ,to
draw him^free, it was he himself who
made the last , supreme effort and
helped them to get him out.
'\u25a0 Then they laid him so gently; on the
stretcher' and* hurried; him to the Pa? \

"of sympathy everything gave â¢ way ; to V

MARGARET E. SANGSTER'S TALKS
HOW TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF THE POPULAR
WEEK'S END VISIT WITH TACT AND TASTE.

the poor .would be amazed If they knew
bow strenuously hundreds of rich men .'
work. dÂ£sdain>^ to 'spend * theif lives -
in tb'e pursuit of mere pleasure. - -
The week's end, bringing with it the
Saturday half-boHday, tempts thou
sands from city dust, and Closeness Â£0
the enjoyment of rural quiet and the
,6weet peace of the* " country. Another <
notable feature of present day life is
seen in the multiplication of' suburban
homes, which are no longer exceptional, '\u25a0
bat are the frequent choice, of* young '
married people, cf middle-aged people
who seek repos.e and ef men who like
a bit cf garden' and a cottage when '
"their day's work Is done.- Add to this ;
the growing popularity â¢of outdoor '
sport as a hopeful. sign of the times. '
During the summer the . Saturday
train and boats are thronged wi*.h
traveler*, who . carry salt cases and
who go with llgtit "luggage for a day
or two away from home. . * . - *
The hostess who sends ah invitation
to her friend In town for this Saturday
to Monday visit should, "be careful ib
specify definitely dates and trains. Fash
ion and courtesy now require that there
should be no uncertainty as to the time
for T*hiclÂ» a guest is invited, the hours
for arrival and departure beins precisely
stated, if the coming guest bta man of
affairs, and the morning or af texnoon
being more broadly mentioned to a fem
inine guest. ' . \
Thus juts. Hunter asking JSliss" Green
to pay htr -a week's end visit may, say;
"Pleaso cive me the great ' pleasure of
having you in this home *'ot mine,
woicb you have not yet seen, and come
to me \u25a0 fji. Friday afternoon' (naming
month and day). I will meet you at the
station at & o'clock. You v.i 11 find; the
4 -o'clock express a very easy and . com-
Icrtable train. I hope that you # will. re- 1
main with me until Tuesday afternoon." â¢
Inviting a man whqse time was 'not 'his"
own the same hostess would ask him to
t-oroe on Saturday afternoon, and stay
. until Monday morning, assuring him that
lie ccuid have breakfast at any hour on
Monday that would suit his convenience.".
A guest who goes for ; the week's end
visit should not be burdened with too
many changes. of raiment., A man, may :
take his evening clothes,, so that if "Uie;
household be formal he can dress "or"
dinner. He may take besides a suit of
flannels that he may be ready for tennis
or golf. - . .
' A-wooan, -m addition to her traveling
dress, should have. *a nrettv. enwn of or-
oientÂ« painted them in simple...draper
ies and with wings large, gloriou'siand
inagniflcent in color,* tinted with Y the
rainbow hues of heaven. .When these
rtngel wings tvere outspread"' they
.formed a nrorgcous background for th.ci.
figure, and when they were at rest the v
â¢tips of the wings drooped ".to the 1 ;
ground. , "â¢" /,"''/â¢
â¢There is a quaint tradition that the'
! idea of giving wingfs to God's messen-" 1

it is not a duty foolishly to loan money.

For the rest, beware of having holes in

that lean chap with. the bloated features;
the one with the brown hat." ' *
Of course we saw 'him. We couldn't
help keelns Mm, for, as a matter 'of fact,
he was the pnly person In front of Carle
ton Crane's office at that particular mo.
mjjnt.
"Well," resumed Mr. . Pinkerton, after
a second "or so at thinking, during which
his heavy eyebrows lowered themselves
methodically Qvcr his dark searching
eye8 >s "that fellow is a yeggman, one of
that' sneaking, treacherous class of crimi
nals that we have been discussing.
Watch me." The . veteran criminal hunt
er pulled his dicer down rather oddly
over His face, stretched his tall and well
proportioned form, buttoned up his blue
sack' coat and, beckoning , us to follow,
he started, leisurely across Market street
for a point un the Palace- Hotel side
walk, above where the man he had
pointed out was standing. Intuitively we
to6k another course that landed us far
ther down the block, just below the ob
ject of our previous scrutiny.
The yeggman, for we" were later con-
vin.eed of his jconnection with that now
notorious class. of public offenders, is a
daily frequenter of Market street, which
h't- patrols in search of buyers of his
wares, assorted collar buttons, displayed
i^n a small tray, which he holds out to
passers-by as he yells: â¢ .
vCollac buttons! Collar buttons^ three
for -a dime! Take your pick; three for
;i dime!*" V "â¢'.'\u25a0'--" . "
Crossing the marble sidt-walk, the de-.i

then started down toward the button
r; Jdier. who was chanting in his accus
omed monotonous way, as he nervously
-v.KÂ»g his head from .the right to the
< ft. ar.d shovÂ«-d his tray under the noses
i pedestrUns." When "he .'reached the
t'low Pinkerton paused for a second,
;â¢:â¢] then in v. quiet voice addressed the
-t-ddler in Â«ome strange kind. of jargun.
Ihr fellow qu'ckly turned his face up
owiird that of Pinkerton;. then glanced
:bout him; backed "closer in toward they
uildins, raa4Â£ another and closer U;

Inally, eussumittg an* expression -of ease,'
-epJled to the stranger before him. " For
several minutes we watched the pair and
:hen slowly moved up a few paces, pud-.
Jenly the peddler looked up at Pinkerton
md asked him. some question.
â¢ "Chi Jaclc," we. heard Pinkertfen. re
j!y. The words. had a startling effect on
he peddler, who. quickly faced the de
cctive, and as he grasped. him by the
land he laughed in such a cheTy man
2tr ti^at we were satisfied that be bad
\u25a0ecei\*e4 some assuring word "from his
;ew acquaintance. They had \ talked for
\u25a0cx-eral minutes, the greater part ot the
ime in low tones, when suddenly the
teddler* lowered his head and hissed out
f the side of his mouth, "The butt!" Pin-
Lerton, like a man guilty of some crime*
ast a glance over his shoulder toward
ji approaching officer, and as the lat
er passed the pair they remained, in
ilence. When, the officer had .got be
ond bearing they resumed their con
crsation,: and continued it \u25a0 for severa],
ainutes longer, when* Pinkerton and the
eddler shook hands and 'parted.
"1 was not mistaken." remarked
'Inkerton, as we rejoined him* at % the
ntrance of the Pa.lace Hotel and start.-

assured him that I had come west for

quiet talk about business and the gang;
many prominent members of which he
had either met or was' familiar with
by reputation. /55f^j
"That fellow has been what; they call
a 'say cat.' He doesn't do any of the

He threw away the cigarette stump
from hia yellow Anger*; and^ began to
knot a .running bowline on tbe end of
a raxrhlde. "I will do myself the -honor
of capturing: him. He covered me with
that revolver of his this mprnins, and
put me to shame before the men. I have
not -forgotten."
â¢â¢And the other Englishman?" said the
ex-priest. "He fought well for us In
the morning. He Is brave.?
"And to It far too dangerous- to be
left alive, padre, aft,er we garrote the
Bailor."
"My dear Cuchlllo," said the"- eCcle
elasttc. "you are so abominably t>lood :
thirsty. But I suppose you are right.
I will come with you, and if the man
BhbwÃ trouble, I will shoot him where
hie sits." He and the mulatto got up
as he spoke, and the other men rose
also, and the six of them ltft the ln
genio silently, on the side away from
the' camp. The jungle growths of the
ruined plantation swallowed them out
oT eight. They held along their way
silently and confidently, like ' men well
skilled in . "woodcraft. With primitive
cunning they had arranged to make
their, attack from the rear.
..The ooise of their chatter ceased, and
from- the distance there went up into
tiiV hot. tropical night, faint snatches
of. the. "Swanee River," sung by a
Louisiana .negro, who had grown de
lirious from -a wound. . â¢ *. .
â¢ -in". 'tie meanwhile the'two Englishmen
v^ere takingr their' tobacco barely a
couple.' ot hundred yards away. â¢ They
iiad.-lsuilt a small fire of green wood,
and "\verc slttilig in jthe jtllcy. of smoke
as fcomc refue.e. from tiie . swarming mos
qiittos,'-and.' the conversation ran upon
liicttiselves and their own prospects.
"I don't want to mess about with a
crtiwu," Captain Kettle was saying. "A
.cheese-cutter, cap's good enough 'for
me. or, seeing that Cuba's hot; a pith
helmet" might be preferable, if we are
.going in for luxury."- fits peered
through the smoke wreaths at the
camp of the revolutionists, a naked
bivouac chopped from among the canes,
u:id strewn â¢ with sleeping men who
moaned In' their . dreams. The ruined
iiyjenio at the further, side had its
whit* walls smeared with smoke. The
place ached' with poverty and squalor.
." t'Kot that' there seems rnuca luxury
here."* he- went- on. "These beauties
haven't"! it sound pair of breeches
ambus them and if It wasn't for the
rilles' -.and" ammunition we brought
ashore from the poor old Sultan, sir,
I'd" say they'd 'just starve to death be
'fofe they . kicked " Che Spaniards out
af " the. "island. But if ugliness means
pluck* there should.be nuue better as
righting men; and when we get to boss
ing -them properly you'll see we shall
just -make' this revolutionary business
hum,- "You are going to stay on -ana
help, Mr. Carnf orth ?** "
The :t>lg man in the shooting coat
gave a" rueful la"ugh. "You've got my
promise. Â« Kettle. I don't see any way
of 'backing. out of It."
"**T thank, you for that, sir," said the
sailor .'with a bow. "When I come to
be formally made King of these Cu
bi>jia you. shrill, find I am not ungrate
fuL* I am not a. man to neglect either
my friends or "my enemies. .
. .â¢\u25a0'â¢"You'ehall sign on as Prim* Minister,

â¢dreary business you wore used to in

-'"It's a fact,* sir." said the other
with a sigh, ."1 *do like to have the or
dering of men. But â¢ don't you think
that's the only reason I'm taking on
with this racUet. I'm a. man with an
income to make and I'm out of a berth
elsewhere. * I'm a. man with a family,
blt."
/"I Ani a "bachelor," -said Carnforth,
"taxid J'ln thanlting heaven tor it this
minute. Uoesn't it strike you, captain,
that this is no sort 'of a job for a mar
ried, man? Can't .you ste it's far, too

"lilg pay, big. risk; that's always the
way, sir, .and as I'Ve faced ugly places*
before and come out on top side, there's
nn reason why 1 shouldn't do it again
here. Indeed, it's the thought of my
wife that's principally pushing me on.
During all^ the time we've been-.to
gether, Mr. Cam forth, I've never been
u.ble to give Mrs. Kettle the place I'd
wieh.
"She was "brought up, sir, as the
daughter of a minister of religion, and
splendidly educated; 'she can play the
harmonium and- do crewel work; and,
though I'll not deny I married her from
.behind a bar, I may tell you she only
took, to business from a liking to see
6ocietj\" He looked out dreamily
through the smoke at the fireflies
which were winking across the black
rim of the forest.
Td ' like to see her, Mr. Carnf orth,
\u25a0with sold brooches and chains and a
black satin dress and a bonnet that
cost 20 shilling's, sitting in Government
house, -with, the British Consul on the
mat before her, waiting (till she chose
to ask him. to take a chair and talk.
She'd fill the position splendidly,, and
I've .Just got to wade in and get it for
her."
The little man broke off and started
out at the / fireflies, and Carnforth
couphed the wood " smoke from his
lunsra and rammed fresh; tobacco into
his pipe." He was a man with a fine
sense of humor and he appreciated to
the full, the ludicrousness of Kettle's
pretensions.' The sailor had; run a car.r
go of 'much-wanted contraband of war
ot\ tb * the Cuban beach, had sunk a
Spanish cruiser in the process .and' had
received prolusivc thanks.
But he had taken the^florid metaphor
of the country to mean a literal offer,
and when in their complimentary
phrase they shouted that he should^ be
king, a king from that moment he in
tended tb bo. The comedy of the sit
uation was irresistible. ; .
But at the same time Mr. 'Martin Cam
forth was a. man of .wealth, arid a man
(in England) of assured position; and
he could not avoid seeing that by his
present association with Captain Owen
Kettle lie was flirting with ugly tragedy
every moment that he .lived. Yet here
he was pinned, not only to keep in the
man's society, but to help him in his
mad endeavors.
" He would -gladly have forfeited half
his fortune to be: snugly back in St.
Stephen's, Westminster, . clear of the
mess; but 'escape was out of the ques
tion; and, moreover, he knew quite
well that trying to make Kettle appro
ciate his true position would be like an
attempt to reason with the " winds or
the surf on an ocean beach. So he. held
his tongue, and did as he was bidden.
He was a man of physical bravery, and
the ruShS)f actual fighting that morning
had come pleasantly to him.
It was only when , he thousht of the
certain and treacherous dangers of the
future, and the cozy niche that awaited
him at home in England, that his throat
tickled with apprehension, and lie-ca
ressed with affectionate tinsers the re
gion of his carotids. And if he had known
that at tjiat precise moment the ex-priest,
and the' mulatto' they called El Cuchillo.
and ,the others of the insurgent leaders
were stalking him with a view to capture
and execution, it is probable that he
would have felt even still more disturbed.
"We did well Â»in that fight this morn-
Ing," said Kettle presently, as h3 drew
his eyes aw4y - from the light-snaps of
the fireflies, and shut them to keep out
thp stlnâ¢ of the wood, smoke, "You've
been shot at before, sir?" . .
"Never." said Carnforth.
"You couidn't have been cooler, sir/if
you'd been at sea' all your life; arid seen (
pins 'flying every watch. Do you know,
I've been thinking it over, and I'm be
ginning to fancy that perhaps our black
and yellow - mongrels weren't ..quite such
cowards as I said. I. know they did scut
tle to the bushes like; rabbits "so" sooli as
ever a gun was fired,. but then their busi
ness is to shoot these Spanish soldiers
ai:d not pet shot back, and .so. perhaps,
they were right to keep .to their own
way.
"Anyway. "â¢ we licked them, and that
â¢ means gcttlnÃ on toward. Mrs. Kettle's
being a" Queen. But that murdering the
wounded afterward was more than I can
stand, and It has got to be put a stop to."
"You didn't make yourself popular
over it.*-*! ; : , ' * : .'^vl : '. ' \u25a0'â¢
"I am not usually liked when I am
captain." said 'Kettle grimly..
"WelL skipper, I don't, as a rule,
agree with your methods, as you know,
but here I'm with you' all the way.
Your excellent subjects rare a great deal
tco baibarous for my taste." ,
"They are wholly brutes, and that's a
fact," said : Captain Kettle, "and I- ex
pect *a good, many of them "will be hurt
while I'm teaching them- manners". ; But
they've grot "to â¢ learn thia â¢ lesson": first . ot
all: They're -to treat /their prisoners
decently! or/else "let^them igo,. or else
shoot. : them clean and dead '- In \u25a0 the . first
Instance while' " they!re still on 1 the run.
I'm a man "myself, Mr. Carnforth", that
can do ;a deal In hot blood; but after
ward, when the poor; brutes are on the
ground. . I want to go .' round with ' stick
ing plaster, and. not a knife to slit\their
throats." * . .- '\u25a0 ; .
"It will take 7a tolerable amount of
trouble" to driifn "that into -. this crew. A
Spaniard on flic warpath is not merci
ful; an '.African' is a barbarian;' but make
a cross* of ' the two (a"s you gat ; here)
and you turn-out the; most unutterable
savage on the face "of^, the earth."
" "They will' riot be taught: by kindness
alone," said Captain Kettle suggestively:
"I've got heavy' hands, and I : shan't be
afraid; to use them. Ifsa- job,"' he
added" with a sigh, '\u25a0which \ will not come
new to me. . I've put \u25a0to sea with some
of the worst ..toughs that ever wrote
their â¢ crosses before a :â¢ shipping master,
and none - of "them"; can" ever ; say " they
got the top ' side of me .' yet." " ;
He was about to say more, but at
that ' moment ' speech,, was taken ; from
him. A long rawhide y suddenly
flicked- out" into; the air like a' sllin,
black snake: the riobse at its . end for an
instant poised J open-mouthed above him
and -then it descended around his. elbows
and was : as; '\u25a0'. simultaneously plucked
taut by. unseen hands' behind 'the /shel
ter of \ the- jungle. Captain; Kettle
struggled like a wildcat] to â¢ release;him
self, but/: four lithe, bony.; men' threw
themselves upon him,, twisted his arms
behind "his back, and made" them last
there with ; other - thongs of * rawhide!
Carnforth did nothing to help. . At
the. first alarm that/ burly., gentlernari
had looked up: and discovered a .-rifle
muzzle, not ten, feet off, pointed square
ly at. his breast. The"v9ico of the ex
priest came from behind the rifle and
assured him' Inymlld.,;unctuous tones
that the Icastim6yement/*w6uld r secure
him a quick and instant passage tb; one
or other of; the . nÂ«*xt worlds.' . And ' Ma- â¢
tin Carnforth,: -surrendered" 'without
terms. When ithV : four;. rriens had fin
ished , their "other they came
and roped \u25a0 him , up { also.
-The riiujatt^ strode fout from the
cover, and": flicked' the : ashes ?of .'aHclg-'
arette into Kettlc^s ' face. "El '\u25a0 rey," he
said, . "de t lob V Cubanos "must ; have /his
powers limited. He^ .has* come, where ;he
was' not 'wan ted; -he .has; done; what'; was
forbidden ' and ' shortly, he will : taste ' the ;

"You gingerbread : colored beast,"

ing."'::' ' "-' '.. : - \u25a0 .'\u25a0'/. . .\u25a0 : . '" ',
The mulatto", pressed the . lighted \ end
of his cigarette against " Kettle's f oVe- :
head. '"I will trouble you.": he said,
"to keep'; silence t for, the present. At
''dawn you will' be put : upon â¢ trial and
then you; may speak. 'But till then

Kettle glared, but with an' effort
licild his -tongue. He understood the
was In a very tight place. And:for
the present the only /.thing remaining,
for hlin.was to bide" his 1 time. ''He quite
recogrnlzed that he was in dangerous
hands.- The mulatto was a man of
education, who'Miad been brought up in
an American college, and' who
learned .in the States to hiate his; white
father and " loathe his black . "mother

He ; was a fellow living on ' the border
land of the two primitive colors, and 'his
whole (life was soured by the pigmentj in
his skin. As a white man he would' have
been a genius;, as a black he would; have
become a star;' but asa mulatto he was
merely a suave ; and brilliant ' savage,"
Ihirstins lor. vengeance against , the" whole .

a situation sliD from his fingers, ioir; even
a few short hours without exacting a.
bitter' retribution when the chance was
put In'hisv.ay. . . \u25a0'/ :,X
Carnforth lifted up his voice in expostu
lation, but was quickly, silenced by the;
promise of branding from ; the cigarette
end' if he did not choose to. hold, his
tongue. Quie^ fell over the i group.;; The
only . sounds were scraps of the "Sw,ariee f
River" sung bys the woundednegro in i his
delirium from somewhere in* thejdistance : .
"Still? longing : for The old |
And for; the old folks at- home," ; ; ,
came the words in a thin quavering tenor, ,
and Carnforth,: with. a' sigh,- thought how
well he could indorse them.
The first glow of morning : saw the
camp aroused^ and half an hour -later the
court was ranged. The self-styled judges
sat under" the'; whitewashed piazza of v thc
ruined house: the motley troops faced
them In an irregular ring ' twenty yards
away ; and the .' two prisoners, with .; an
armed 'man^to guard each, stood on the

he said, "and in the meanwhile you may
ewait my pleasure out of the sun

He save another order knd the men
laid hands upon their shoulders and led
them away, and thrust them into - a
email arched room of whitened stone,
under the boiler-house of the ingenio.
The window was a mere arrow slit; the
door was a ponderous thing of Span
ish oak, barred with iron bolts which
ran into the stonework; the place was
absolutely unbreakable. . -~
The silence had lasted a dozen hours,
although it was plain that each of the
prisoners was busily thinking. At last
Kettle spoke. . *
"If I could only get a rhyme to
'brow/ " he eaid, "I believe I could
manage the rest." ,;
. "What?" asked Carnforth.
"I . want a word to rhymo with
*brow,' sir. If you can help me."
"What In the world are you up to,
now?" , \u25a0 ' .- -
""I've -been filling up time, sir, while
we've been hereb y hammering out a
bit of poetry about- those fireflies. I
got the idea of it last night, when we
saw them flashing in and out against
the. black of : the forest."
"You don't owe them much gratitude
that I can see, skipper. According "to
what you said. If you hadn't been look-
Ing at them, you'd have been more on
the watch and wouldn't have got

"Perfectly right, sir. And â¢> this
poem should be all the more valuable
when it's put together. I'm running it
to the tune of 'Greenland's Icy Moun
tains/ my favorite air, <\u25a0 Mr. Cam
forth, rm trying to work a parallel
between those fireflies switching their,
lights In and out and a. soul, sir.- Do
you catch the Idea?"
, "I can't say I do quite."
Captain Kettle rubbed thoughtfully
at his beard. "Well, I'm a trifle misty
about It myself," he admitted, "but it
will make none the worse poetry" for
being a bit tha"Â£ way If I can get the
rhymes all right.". V
" 'Plow*, might suit you." Carnforth
suggested. \ -
"That's just; the word I want, sir.
â¢The fields. of heaven to plow.' That
would be. the very occupation the soul
of the.; man I'm thinking about Would
delight In; something restful and in
the agricultural line, I wanted to give
him a good time up there. He was
due for it," he- added thoughtfully, and
then he closed his eyes and fell .to
maknag further poetry.
Martin Carnfortb knew the little ruf
fian's taste for this form of exercise,
but It seemed to "him jarringly out of
place just then. ."I am in no mood for

frown. / ; \u25a0 , ... . .

rather a ,- harsh laugh. â¢ "The place Is

Is there no place of repentance for

Is there no day when old things pas 3
away and all things become new? Can
a man not turn his back upon his past
and. begin again with self-respect and
the respect of his fellow-men?- Society
by a sound instinct requires a man to
prove" his repentance by his work; so
ciety also by a sound instinct if he id
repentant refuses to rake up the past

a man not humbly but boldly forgive
himself if "his -fellows have forgiven

should that . sinner be more righteous

are tucked awayâ in the box under the
lid that forms the seat of the settle.
This unassuming wash bench * serves
three purposes: closet, table and settle.
If painted in a plain color that har
monizes with the tones of the room, and
always kept in immaculate condition,
this piece of furniture, both when fixed
up" for company and when ready for
business, will prove a most useful mem
ber-of the "household."
\u25a0 An almost indispensable part of this
abbreviated housekeeping: paraphernalia
is the steamer. It seems specially de
signed for the needs of room-dwellers.
Several vegetables may be cooked over
one burner - from one tank of boiling
water. The water, however, does not
touch the vegetables; they are steamed,
which, by the way, is - the preferred
method of cooking. There are four ves
sels, one upon the other, the lowest of
which contains boiling water. The
steam â¢ from this is communicated to
each" of the chambers above, containing
the vegetables, and finally emerges
through the lid at the top. The princi
ple is very simple, and the advantages
gained by using such a method are quite
apparent. . >

from what you, our correspondent,
told ; me Hast \ week of your occupa

consideration with you. The study
of â¢second-best cuts is, therefore, one
you should befcin forthwith.
Get your, butcher to cut a shapely
1 piece,- weighing about four pounds,
from a round of beef. \ If, as a rus

home, put aside until next morning.
Then, . while the house is in airing
and odori'will not cling and linger;

the fire, and .when it hisses-lay, in the

ANTIQUE PATTERNS IN DINNER CENTRES
IT IS an Interesting fact that the

the oldest Idea the authorities can

old Italian is the "newest * creation.

" -The name of this' popular- lace is
rfilet." "It has" a Â«drt of plain square
mesh^. wherels are worked quaint de

arms; lions rampant, and ' impossible
birds. This filet lÂ«ce is ueually placed
la combination with something else-7
Florentine- lace. Cluny and eyelet-em
fcrbidered linear. . -The last combination
\u25a0is called the "nlet and anglalse . work,
end is very popular. It. lias a rather
odd APoaarance, but very artisUc Hotv
Â«ver.- there are somthtnUtome^ pieces,
that are trimmed exclusively with filet
lace.- One centre about a yard and a
half to diameter Is particularly quaint
fa idea. There is a narrow. border ot
the lace, while syuares of it are set in
the linen at not very frequent intervals
JUany of the. old-tirqe -treatments â¢of

Another interesting Italian lace Is the

is- bordered by a deep edge of thlÂ»> lace,

DIVERSION FOR WOMEN

to conduct themselves in ways they do
not at all relish., while, their mothers do
not understand why the customs that
prevailed in 'their own girlhood are not

They were able to take care of them
selves without all this looking after;
why cannot their daughters do the same
thing? 'â¢ \u25a0 : . ' ' -
Well, there are several very good and
sensible reasons for the change, with
which fashion, all-powerfur as It is,
has had' nothing to do. ' In. the. first
place," society is much more complex
than It used to be. We no longer know
everybody in our especial neighbor
hoods, and who \u25a0 they are and where
they came lrom, as used to be the case
thirty or forty years ago. America has
grown to be a great country, 1 and , ! it
behooves" us to "mind our manners,"
now that. the eyes of the world are
upon us. The freedom that the Amer
lcap girl enjoyed, while it perhaps gave
her an independence and vivacity that
were irresistible, certainly made her,
oucfcide of her own land at least, the
most misunderstood young woman in
the world. Years ago Henry James
showed us In "Daisy Miller" just what
foreign society thought of the unchap
eroned girl and what construction they
and trellis work, the roses lavishly, yet
delicately, displayed over the border and
on to the centre.. Another beautiful Ger
man drawn dinner cloth has a Renais
sance edge and insertion. Still another
is of solid design, outlined in a raised
edge. :â¢?"* . '.":;. - ; . \u25a0 \ . I.-/:. :.: â¢ :,;---v.
Bruges lace also holds a prominent

embroidery corresponding with the pat

round centrepiece Is edged with Arabian
lace, rich In a display of scroll patterns.
In this also the enrbroldery on the linen
Is of the. same design as . the lace. '

put on her most innocent, actions. Now
adays people travel J more than they
used to. Almost every American of
means has oeen to Europe, and we have
learned that there is much good in some
of the customs of the I Old World after
all, and are adopting many of them to
a modified degree. And so It comes
about' that the young.glrl of to-day in
our most fashionable ' society, in what
for want of a - better . term is referred
to as the "Smart :Set.'U is' much more
carefully . hedged - about by . the propri
eties than her mother used to"be. She
is not yet quite so patiently chaperoned
as her English cousin, nor is she guard
ed, from masculines glances; with" the
same strictness as \ the?-Jeune fille of
France, who never stirs without her
duenna; but she is a little more care
fully protected than she used to \u25a0\u25a0 be,
and.- many people .think her value ' is
greatly enhanced in this way,, Now, in
this complex America of ours, there are
certain rules on : the; subject that are
only applicable to very rich," formal and
fashionable society, that apes English
customs.- and which would be "rather
ridiculous' among -people- of .moderate
means in the smaller towns and cities
of the country. And - there are also a
few other rules which are followed
everywhere by refined people; these
latter I shall try to point out.
.The long, narrow^ covers.- commonly
known as runners, are occasionally used
on American tables, but much more so
abroad,- Some of the newest designs are
In "filet and anglalse," with Cluny edges.

GAY CROWN PRINCE OF SERVIA KEEPS KINGDOM IN A WHIRL
POPULACE ALARMED AT POSSIBILITY OF HIS SUCCESSIQN TO THE THRONE.
Kins: Peter Unpopular and May Be jTHrust Aside /Before the
End of Ms Reign for
â¢VIEXN-A, Dec 3.â Affairs In Servia are
,to a bad way. King Peter's accession and
fthe bloody removal of the Obrenovich dy
â¢ nasty have not brousht the blessings
. which the nation was led to anticipate.
.IMsoontent prevails everywhere. The
traitorous assassins of . Alexander and
, Draga are themselves disappointed,, even
to the extent of admitting that they made
a mistake. The common people are be
ginning to epeak of the good qualities of
l Alexander. . The external relations of the
.Country are no better. The powers main
.tain without exception a distinctly un
friendly attitude. King Peter has not yet
V*en able to arrange a visit to any for
,'s"tn court. At home and abroad the out
look la gloomy. Everybody Is asking
i^rnat will be the outcome. Will the King
abdicate? and. who will succeed him? The
. iCwxwn Prince would be even worse. Per
ihaps Prince Mlrko of Montenegro may be
the next Kins: of Servia.
\u0084' -,-.} King Peter. ls regarded as an. amiable
man. but not a particularly clever one,
'by.no means clever jenoujrh for. "^he 1 ex
tremely .difficult position he has to fill.
Many things are against him. To b*sin
with ho has no private means; they were
all used up In his. forty years' exile. Ac
cording to common report the last rem
nants of his | fortune went in forwarding
thÂ« conspiracy which resulted in the as
. gasslnatlon 'of Alexander and Draga,
KJntr Alexander had not much money,. it
Is true. only, some SGO.OOO a year, but it
â¢\u25a0 vsaÂ». better, than nothing 1 , and King Peter
. 'would be very glad if he had as much.
His Income as sovereign Is only $240,000 a
' \u25a0 year, which is not a very great sum < for"
the maintenance of a royal household.
TROUBLESOME CROWX PRIXCE.
The people generally were disposed at
first to glvÂ« the King a cordial welcome.
But when.it was seen how completely he
wa* under the influence of the conspira
tors, and the news of his implication in
the blo"ody - tragedy gradually spread
throughout the land, popular opinion be
gan to turn against him. His want' of
tact and cleverness has made his position
rtill worse. Only recently on his "narae
â¢ day" he entertained some seventy officers
at a banquet, and every one without ex
ception belonged to the conspirators'
party. Only these officers, top, have been
: honored with the royal decoration of the
JCarageorgevich star. By thus restricting
the royal favor to the conspirators the
Kins haÂ« caused much discontent. . â¢
But his Majesty's sorest trial and worst
misfortune -is the Crown Prince, whose
future- accession to the throne is viewed
with positive alarm and apprehension on
all aides. Prince Georse -has "many fssl-
Jngs. but the worst is his ungovernable
tamper. Tliig has already led him into
innumerable troubles, rome slight and
some more serious. Neither King Peter,
ncir Major Lavasseur, the Prince's Gov
ernor, nor anybody else has the slightest
\u25a0Influence over him. Jn vain; has xhe King
given instructions to Lax'asseur and the
â¢ officers of the household to deal. severely
with his son and heir. All is of no avail.
Only the other day the' Prince wanted
to ride hi* bicycle round the palace gar
dens. The gate was locked " and the .offi
cer on duty offered to fetch the key. The
Prince immediately became furious, and
vowing he would" not wait rode madly at
the cate with his bicycle. , He smashed
hi? machine. This enraged him still more
and he: struck the unoffending officer In
ttie face,- who promptly .returned .-.the
blow, and only the intervention of an
other officer prevented a . flsht. .
It* was lucky for \u25a0 the officer that , the
Prince did not shoot him. for' revolver
shooting ,is Prince George's, favorite
pastime. The walls and ceilings of his
apartments are "covered .with: bullet
marks, which are particularly- numer-,
ous In the door leading,. to the royal
quarters. The reason, for this is that
the Prince in order to keep his governor
from coming into the room takes - the
door for a 'target.

Prince's â¢ governor. Major ' La vasaeur,
who if a distinguished French cavalry
officer, has had enough of. his post and
went away two months ago. He left
once before, distrusted with his royal
pupil, and It was only through King
Peter's Intervention, with the French
Ministry of War' that the gallant officer
was induced to return-to Belgrade..' In
cidentally King Peter had to make a
substantial increase in the major's
honorarium as vrell. .
Prince George's revolver is the ter
ror of all his neighbors who have dogs
or cats. Scarcely .a pet animal is left
in the vicinity. The* Crown Prince's bi
cycle is a particularly fine' American
one and. he is immensely proud of it.
He told all the palace servants that
with the exception of God, his father
and himself nobody has any right even
to touch it. ;
, One fine day his younger brother.
Prince Alexander, who was ignorant of
this strict ordinance, went to the royal
stables, took the bicycle and rode over
to the Topchider Park, just outside' Bel
grade. In the meantime the Crown
Prince thought he would go for a ride
and he sent his servant for the wheeL
,The man came back, saying that Prince
Alexander .had taken .it. -\u25a0 The Crown
Prince flew into a violent rage, started
for the stables and struck the first man
he met there .with a -riding- whip and
almost cut out his eye. Maddened with
pain, the tervant seiaed a. shovel and
aimed a blow at the. Prince. The for
mer's valet, however, ], seized the man
and called for : help. The servant was
discharged and' given , three months'
wages. â¢ . .. .'._â¢.â¢
Prince Alexander recently left Bel
grade-and entered the. corps, of imperial
pages at St. Petersburg and it is said
this was owing entirely to disagree
ments ' with his elder brother. They
were continually quarreling, and, #in
fact, it frequently came to : open fights.
Prince Alexander is intellectually far
superior to the Crown Prince and of
much better' character altogether. -
SEX? ATIONAI.. LOVE AFFAIRS.
Although only just past his eight
eenth birthday, the Prince's adventures
with the fair sex have already attracted
attention. Some time ago a nâ¬w actress
appeared at the Belgrade Opera-house,
a certain Desanka Gyorgyevit?.
lady was .formerly- the- wife of a Ser
vian diplomat in Bucharest,: whence
'she eloped with a secretary atta.cb.edto
another legation. He soon tired of her
and then she went â¢- to Vienna" and
studied in a. dramatic .school. She was
a vivacious woman and found' little dif
ficulty in- obtalning; r engagements. She
scored a 'great success' in her" native
city, where sh2 found many admirers.
But the chief/and most ardent of them
all â¢ was .the \ Crown '\u25a0 Prince, - who '; became
greatly enamefed of -her 1 . He was In" the
royal box at ' every \u25a0 performance in.which
she appeared." ; He' sent ; her innumerable

Union Square Hall was crowded to
its limit on the third Friday in No
vember on the occasion of the exempli
fication of the adoption degree of the
Pocahontasee in the presence of Great
Incohonee Cherry. Great Chief ot
Records Brooks. Great Sachem Cun-'
ning and other great chiefs of the res
ervation of California. The hall was
profusely decorated with trees, shrubs
.-tnd bunting and American streamers,
but the American flags usually a
prominent' feature on occasions of
this ' kind, were not In evidence.
The .session was called to order
by Great Prophetess Annie M. Bliss,
chairman of the committee of arrange
ments. She â¢ introduced Past Great
Sachem .F. D. Brandon, who delivered a
very long talk on the order In extend
ing a welcome to the visitors from the
.other side of the Sierras. The adoption
work was then carried out by a team
composed of members of the local
councils in a most creditable manner.
The learn was assisted by Joseph Rice,
the- electrician of .Manzanita Council,
â¢who provided the electrical effects and
lights, together with the screen pic
tures .whie.h illustrated the story of the
'adoption. Great Representative J. J.
Bryan, alÂ»o of Manzanita Council. WatÂ»
the lecturer during the display of the
pl.ctur.es. which were the clearest and
most striking that have ever been pre
.sÂ«ited in this city. Those who took
part in the conferring of the degree
-were Victoria Godfrey of On'eida, as Po-,
cahontas; Mrs. Eisner of â¢ Wendigoes,
W-enonaii; Emma Rice. . Manzanita,
prophetess; Jack Fairgrave of Popa
hor.tas, Powhattan; Barbara Overmole,

At- the close of the ceremony the vieit
\u25a0ing'chiefs. the great sachem. T. J. Bel!
of the committee appointed by the
Great Council of the United States to
revise the ritual; George Wheeler,
great 'sannap, who. drilled the team,
and Great Pocahontas Jennie Crase,
each gave a talk aijd all complimented
the team and Its work. All were of the
opinion that having seen the degree
put on as ft should be there is no rea
son for altering the ritual. The great
Incohonee said that hÂ§ had seen the
degree exemplified In other Jurisdic
tions, but that nowhere had it ever
been* put on in such an impressive and
dramatic manner. San Francisco, he
said, beats every other reservation In
putting on the degree. I

The masquerade ball givei. by Walla (
Walla Tribe and Kaweah Council in

to numbers, fantastic costumes, good
mosic-and jolly participants. The most
grewsome character upon the floor was
an individual who personated death in
a coffin. The. affair, which continued
until- a late" hour in the morning, was

It is composed of two delegates from
the twenty-nine local tribes and meets
'every Saturday night in the Red Men's'

time the board has expended for the
payment of benefits to the sick and for
the* relief jof the distressed the sum of
$4000.. The purpose for which this ball

number of years, and George F. Buck,
who for a long period has stood at the

Although not a young man, he is still
active, and is proud of the fact. that he

continues to move onward and fre

by W. E. Havens, who is as proud of
his team as the team Is of its captain.

Something in steel or oilâ or perhaps the
armyâ something big, 1 should have
judged McKee Rankin had I not" known
him of the stage. He is a man with a
presence; with a face of fine, plutocratic
purples, majestic mustache (white),
thunder black browsâ split with | three
fierce white hairs, and thatched' stiffly
and shortly in uncompromising black and
â¢uniteâ said thatch starting rather lowly
on the brow in a funny, pompous little
avenue. Power, again. lies in the enor
mous jowl, in the eyes, still black, still
bumins. and if there be those who have
cast Mr. Rankin as Svencali to Nance
O'Xeli'g Trilby, he has probably his eyes,
still black, still burning, to thank.
Silk-hatted, black-garbed, be-ringedâ

the Palace, to drop into a tiny ro*cker by
the window, the actor adorning a throne

"And what is it you would like to talk
about?" Mr. Rankin asked, as if there
vere any but one subject of Interest.
And as if anything else mattered. I re
plied: "Oh, everything.*'
And. *just as if Mr. Rankin were merely
an actor with a long past, and not a
bloated monopolist with a corner in trage
diennes, the Nance O'Neil Trustâ in short,
â¢v.c beran to talk of the dear, dead days
of drama. * It is a pity they are beyond
recall, thinks Mr. Rankin, and adduced
many and good reasons for his opinion.
He was monumentally sentimental as
he said: "One of the old euard was
counting us up the other dayâ there are
onlj- eleven of us left. Reminds me of the

Forrest's he wasâ used to imitate all his

"Lovely!"
"And whan Forrest died," Mr. Rankin
concluded, "he said: 'Another one of us
rone!* "
"The kinc is "dead, long liveâ" I de
claimed, adding: "but you think the stage
is short on kings to-day."
This is Mr. Rankln's Other Subject.

part to play, with the same set of act
ors, and most probably â '.' this was
given with elephantine emphasis â "In a
play that amounts to less than nothing,
for hjs first, second, third year of ex
perience. At his luckiest he gets two,
three, half-a-dozen parts in the time.
But how was it time back? The actor
began as utility man in a stock and
star company. There would be a change
in the stars generally every week, For
rest one week. Booth another, Jefferson
another, with sometimes a nightly
change of bill. It was these men that
taught the young actor his art. From
week to week there would be new in
spiration. Booth hammering' at their
tragedy, Jefferson jesting at their com
edy, but always the great example be
fore them."
"We have our stock companies to
day," I protested.
"But not .your stars," the actor re
minded me. He .continued: "But the
young actor of the old days would
probably play 100 parts in his nrs^t
three years â old men, young men, gen
tlemen, thieves, and so have acquired
In that time a certain facility impossi
ble to acquire in these days. I should
put it that conditions to-day are abso
lutely adverse to the man who desires
seriously to become an actor. Coming
to Nance O'Neil â "
Well, I was ready to come to Nance
O'Nell. and as with lovers and the
Eternal Us, talk of other things with
Mr. 1 Rankin is sheer wastes â even on his
Other Subject. Right here. I do not
mind owning to sharing his adoration
for the gifted Californian. I have ray
self tasted the s.weets of martyrdom in
her cause â when naughty Gotham
made fun of my admiration of the
O'Neil Lady Macbeth: I have myself
acquired the right to say '/I told you
so," when Boston acclaimed."
Miss O'Nell, then, has been fortunate
in coming under the Rankin jurisdic
tion, thinks her manager and prophet.
She came to him, recommended by Mr.
Peter Robertson, as the actor admiring
ly recalled. Immediately he recognised
that, as Mr. Robertson said, there was
"something in her." - There was so
much, in fact, that to develop the new
Charlotte CushYnan, the new Ristori,
the actor, according to his faith, took
her barn-storming all over the State
for some years, playing every conceiv
able sort of play.
'They have accused Miss O'Neil of
being 'crude.'" the actor objected with
fortissimo emphasis. "I have been al
most forty-four years on the stage, and
I maintain that Miss O'Neil knows
whatever I know of the trick of acting.
Then, to back her skill she has genius
â which I haven't."
Genius was invariably a troublesome
beast, difficult to domesticate, hard of
recognition. I said â was that the rea
son- for Miss O'Neil's late fiasco in New
York?
Ii was. not, Mr. Rankin assured me.
Did I really want to know the ins and
outs of that business? I
If there was one thing I wanted to
know. It was the "ins and outs' of that
business."'
\u25a0' It was not a nice, story, involving
much' unpretty -condemnation â¢-. of- the
.fraft in New York. Mr. Rankin began
with an account of the preceding Bos
ton triumnh. S .
. : "We had madeÂ«up our minds to take
.Boston,'* he put it, in a brigadier gen
eral sort of . manner. "We had the
.plays â and the star; But we couldn't
get a theater. However, we'd/made up
our minds to break in somehow,' and we
took a theater for the matinees only.
It would amuse you to know of all the
: jnoney that was not in that house the
first week. The second week was better.
'I had invited some nice people the first
week, and they spread abroad the news
of what they had' found, and, In short,
"we played there for sixteen weeks,
w.lth the results you know of. Then we
went to New York."
'. I "knew that the syndicate was not
a favorite with the newspaper folk ( of
'.New. York?" Mr. Rankin asked. Miss
i O'Ne'il had played there under, syndi
'-cate auspices to begin with. Against
her, also, were the Fiske and Belasco
forces â she was "distinctly treading- on
the corns of Mrs. Fiske and Mrs. Car
ter.." Also, she was guilty of the crime
of being approved by Boston, and. still
worse, by San Francisco.
-. "Tut, tut: Mr. Rankin," from the
"audience.*- As to Mrs. Fiske and Mrs.
Carterâ did not genius always befriend
genius? She, . for one, had never be
lieved that Eames slapped Calves
lovely cheek, nor that Sembrich ached
to scratch Tetrazzini's. Nevaire!
' / These things it was, however, con
tended the actor, that affected most
powerfully Nance. O'Neil's short career
in New York. Her career, in fact, "was
decided before she arrived there."
Nothing good could come out of Bos
ton. "Advance stuff" sent from there
relating to the actress, such as a sim
ple statement that Miss O'Neil was
."probably the most traveled actress
now before the public." had been turn
ed into gross ridicule. "London and
'Painted Post/ a tiny, impossible town
In New York.were Instanced as the ex
lent of her travels. And so on. The
actor, in short, alleged the existence.of
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL; \u25a0SUNDAY.' DEGEJVIBKR 3, 1905-
a "concerted attack" on the part of the
crtlics. /
- 'Twas ever thus. ' To'' believe in the
honesty of those who disagree with you
is the rarest of beliefs.- It is perhaps
most exotic to the stage. It was of no
use to argue with Mr. Rankin that
Nance O'Neil^ might be tothe taste of
Boston's reviewers and not to the taste
of New York's, without reflecting upon
the honesty of either. The Rankin mind
is made up, and. New York, publicly
unworshlpful of his pupil and idol, is
not so much stupid and prejudiced as
dishonest. v. ' 'V.--'
"How did' all this affect Miss O'Neil?"-'
I asked.'
"Oh, whenever there is anything: dis
agreeable about her in the papers,",
announced her manager, "I keep it
away from her. What's the use of it?
I don't want her to lose faith in her
selfâthat's essential. And :then . I say
to her, .when anything of theklnd does
some up: 'Never mind, your name will;
be a bright spot in the history of the
world when all these little people- are
forgotten â if they have ever been
noted.' " ~ . â¢ .
That India, Calcutta and Bombay,
where his travel-loving star has beerf
"crazy* to sro,"^ will be their next point
of .adventure, the manager informed
me. Shanghai looms up on 'the way,
and a general Arabian Night-like itin
erary. And after all this? I asked. .
"New York," said -General McKee
Rankin. the three white hnirs in his
black brows fiercely upstanding. "We
are going to camp in New York and
have the fight out."
"Bravo!" said I, "and here is to the
second Siddons."

Notes of the Stage
and Its Celebrities
-Here is the Washington Post on the
latest developments of the national
theater enterprise:
"The announcement was made In New
York by Director Heinrich Conried on
Thursday that an institution to be known
as America's National Theater has been
funded. The cost Is to be $2,000,000, and
it is designed to be to this country what
their- respective national theaters are .to
France and Germany. "The project" of a :
national theater was first broached by
James j Paxton Voorhees. son of the late
Senator Vorhees of Indiana/of this city,
and has had his consistent thought and
energy for nearly ten years. While he
has no direct connection .with the-New
York project, it was undeniably -due to
his influence â¢ that* the project has taken
root, and now seems about to be realized.

Symphony Concerts
at the University
717 1 Professor Frederick J. Wolle. whose
"Bach B minor mass or nothing" made
him famous- in Bethlehem, and whose *
Bach Festivals in Bethlehem made him
famous everywhere, says that we are to
hate a symphony society here. Professor
Wolle is a rood person to wager things
on. Five years. I believe, it was that
he waited before the Bethlehemltes said
they would sing the Bach mass he 'had
asked them to sing. But he got it.' "I *
think he will get his .symphony society.
As a beginning the University of Cali
fornia announces a series of symphony
concerts to be given In the spring under
Professor Wolle's direction, the first to*
take place on February 15 In the, Greek
Theater at Berkeley. There are to- be six .
concerts, the series closing with a grand,
choral concert at which a large part of
"The Messiah" will be given, the univerr
sity chorus to be heard in the choral end.
Subscriptions are now invited , for the
series by the university authorities.' to
be turned over to Professor W. D. Armes,
chairman of the musical and 'dramatic "
committee, and it is "up to" the local
music lover.
However, and with all honor be It re
membered, the financial safety of 'the
concerts is already assured. Mr. F. il..
Smith, the "borax kins," is the generous'
Maecenas who is backing: the expert- '
ment. Mr. Smith has guaranteed -the
university against any possible financial'
loss that might accrue, and large* grati
tude should be going his way. It would
be, -however, deeply deplorable were It â¢
necessary to take advantage of Mi?.* '
Smithes generosity. Â»
The" concerts promise excellently, rfnd
there is surely a public here sufficiently
Interested and sufficiently cultured to
support them. Dr. Wolle's orchestra will ,
include fifty of the best local people ob
tainable, and those present at the Po
lacco symphony concert are not at* all m
ashamed of the local "best." Dr. Wdjle*.

LONDON. Dec. 2. â Mrs. Langtry, # ln
the days -when -her beauty was some
thing to rave over, chilled forever the
friendship of the King, then Prince of
Wajes, by playfully dropping a chunk
of Ice down his back. But Sir Thomas
Lipton the other day applied a bunch
of cold keys to his Majesty's spinal col
umn, and. far from offending his exalt- .
ed notions of dignity, only increased' .
the esteem which the King feels for
him. â¢ " ';. . *â¢Â£;\u25a0
"An interesting story hangs {hereby.
The divinity that hedges about' the
King . affords him no protection from
the common ailments pf â¢ humanity. Fox
the last six months he has' suffered
from frequent outbreaks of nose bleetl
ins. and on occasions, too, when' the
consequences were peculiarly embar
rassing and awkward. More. than once
"he has been- obliged to beat a hasty
and anything but dignified retreat from
a house party dinner 'table* with a
handkerchief clapped to his olfactory
organ. His physicians, . who might
easily have checked a more distressing
malady,- were unable to stop it. A' few
days ago the-JClng was dining with Sir
Thomas Lipton "when the royal nose
began to spout again as though it had
been tapped by a prlze-nghter*s fist and
the royal tjrow grew clouded %
"If your Majesty will permit me, I
think I can stop* It." said the 3arqnet
!'Go t ahead and try," said the King,
"and if you succeed It will prove that
you a,re a cleverer man than any of my
own doctors."
It was then that Sir Thomas dropped
a bunch of keys down the rojal'back
and the nose bleeding soon ceased. The
King was profuse in his expressions of
gratitude. \u25a0:[>
"The -credit belongs to my mother,"
said Sir Thomas. "She has stopped my
nose bleeding that way many. a*.tlme.~
If the Jersey Lily had only waited
until the King's nose bled to drop that
chunk of ice down his back she' might
still be standing high in the royal
favor.

J tended only to the elect of the Huguenot
and -the Quaker fragment of the popu

These identical clubs," or dancing assem
blies, have been perpetuated to the
present day, and many of the members,
and nearly all the officers, are
jlfscendants of the original creators of
the clubs. â¢ â¢ \u25a0

p:etty respectable grandfathers and
Ereat-grandfatbers for the smart set of
the' next half century.

because it 1Â» the most efficient: force of
our time In the matter of matrimony.
In -an eminently -polite manner -smart'
jrirle and men are thus brought together,
who might otherwise not meet, and many
a papa has ehllted his feminine responsi
bilities through paying his daughter's
tax into the club to which she was lucky

And many a man of Kmart dres* and
address â but this is mere incidentâ has

Since matrimony is still regarded as a
desirable institution out West, let us

National Guard Officers Are

Failure to Obey Will Be
Followed by Punislimeiit
Unless an Excuse Is Given
Each of the organizations in the Na-j
tional Guard of California has completed
the Stata shoot for 1905, and the reports
must be in by December 12. If such re
ports are not all in by that time? in the
Second Brigade the delinquents will be
brought up with a round turn and be re
quired to furnish a satisfactory -excuse
for failure to perform a duty imposed Vy
law or else answer, to a' charge of dis-"
obedience of orders. It is the . intention :
of the brigadier general to makean ex
ample of such as are willfully delin
quent. As he has announced his deter
mination in that matter it is believed that
the reports will be in on time this: year. '/
J. F. H. Rickson, on the civil list of
the United States army and stationed in
the quartermaster's department at United
States army headquarters in this- city,
has been appointed assistant
general for the Second- Brigade, vice
Hughes, who has removed to Seattle. The,
new appointee is a thorough military
man, being conversant with all the de
tails of United States army .service. He
was In command of the light battery of
artillery, National Guard, in Arkansas,
before he came to this State; during the
Spanish-American war was a captain of
a company in the Second Regiment of
Engineers, United States volunteers/and
served. on the staff of General' Dickinson.
His engineering knowledge is such that \u25a0
when the time came for [ laying out the
camp at Atascadero he was requested to
lay it out, and he did so to the satisfac
tion of all concerned. It is said that he
is possessed of all the qualifications
requisite for the position to which he has
been assigned;
JUMPIVG OFFICERS.
At an election held in Company C,
Fifth Infantry, located at Petaluma, it
unanimously re-elected J. B. Dickson aa
its captain. ..He is one of the most en
thusiastic commissioned officers of the
regiment, and is thought a great deal of
by the members of his command. It was
from his company that the majority of
the sharpshooters who went to the na
tional shoot at Seabrlght this year wa4
selected, by reason of the fact that the
captain has been training all his men to
become flrst-class marksmen.
At the election in Company I,. Fifth In
fantry, located at Livermore, First Lieu
tenant Lawrance Beck declined to be ad-j
vanced to the captaincy of the company.
Second Lieutenant E. J. Inman was elect
ed captain and. Sergeant; Chester Young
was elected second lieutenant, vice In
man, promoted. . While both men who
have been elected are eminently qualified
for the positions . for which they will be
commissioned, the idea of an officer re
fusing promotion, is net looked upon with
favor at headquarters, and the practice
of "jumping" an- officer. who is in line of
promotion will, for "the good .of the ser
vice," be discountenanced In future.
OAKLAND'S NEW 'ARMORY.
General Koster, brigade commander;
Colonel Hayes, Major Jones, Major Smith,
Captain Waller and Captain Margo went
to' Shell Mound on the last Sunday in
November, to complete their â respective

was at the pistol range. General Koster
made the highest score, forty -six out of a
possible fifty, and Major D. A. Smith the
second- best, forty- four.
On Thanksgiving tve General Koster
and the members of his staff. Colonel Wil
helm. Major Smith of the Fifth Infantry
and Captain Walter ' D. Grattan of the
Coast Artillery, visited Oakland to attend
the dedicatory ceremonies of the new
armory of Company A of the Fifth, on
Twentieth street, between Telegraph ave
nue and Broadway. The ceremonies were
in accordance with military custom, and
after the building had been formally ded
icated to the use for which it was erect
ed there was an expression of opinion by
some of the visiting officers. General
Koster complimented the company on the
magnificent , quarters prepared for it and
expressed the hope that it would be an
Incentive for the members to secure
enough new members to raise the organi
zation to the maximum. Colonel Wllhelm
said that . aa inspector of the guard of
this State he had visited all the armories
of .California, and it was his privllege^o
say that A's armory is the best in the
State, being in every way adapted to the
needs of the organization. The speech
making was followed by a ball and the
dispensation of the company's hospital
ity. . â¢ - "\u25a0\u25a0
SURPRISE FOR OFFICERS.
There is in store a surprise for the
higher officers of the 'Second Brigade,
from the colonel of the . regiment down.
It will be in the nature of "paper work"
for the purpose \of discovering their
knowledge of what they sjiould do In case
their commands were called: into service

PAN-CALIFORNIA ORANGES.
State Board of Trade has striven to advance the interests
I of every part of the State by demonstrating that all California
* has the same climate and production. The orange and other
citrus bruits are an expression of luxury that carries the impression
of a clement and equable climate. The citrus crop of Sicily long
controlled the market of the world. Whenever an orange or lemon
was seen it roused a vision of sunny Italy, of blue sky and the
breath of warm winds, carrying the aroma of flowers. Italy had
been in literature for ages as the land of physical comfort, free from
trying winter. Northern tribes had descended upon it in warlike
swarms to possess its fertile lands and bask in its sunshine. The
orange told the story of it all. So it came to pass that to whatever
part of the world that grew the orange the physical attributes of
Italy were attached. Gold did much for California, but it may be
safely said that the orange has done more in certifying the interests
that are permanent, being fixed in the unchangeable climate of the
For reasons purely economic in their origin, Southern California
first attracted attention by producing the citrus fruits in commercial
quantity. Those fruits finally came to fill the Eastern market. The
crop far outran that of Florida in quantity and quality. The enter
prising people of that part of the State were quick to see their ad
vantage, and Southern California rode into notice and wide fame in
a chariot: of oranges. The results have been stupendous. The popu
lation has increased faster than it can be counted. Tens of. thousands
of people live there who have never seen any other part of the State.
In the East there are yet millions of people who think that all Cali
fornia fruit is grown in Southern California. It is all the work of
the orange.
Only a "few years ago officers of the State Board of Trade pro
moted an exhibition in Sacramento of oranges and lemons grown in
Northern California. The fruit came from the gardens and door
yards of Sacramento. Marysville. Colusa, Chico and Oroville? for in
all California north of the Tehachapi there was not an acre of com
mercial orange orchard. At thai exhibition appeared Mr. Holt of
Riverside, representing the citrus growers of Southern California.
He was stocked up well with oranges, which he freely bestowed on
all visitors, while he talked with good-natured raillery about North
ern California oranges, betraying no fear that the south would ever
feel the influence of any competition in this part of the State.
lint that exposition was the beginning of the development of
the Northern California citrus belt, which is planted with commercial
orange orchards at intervals from Porterville in Tulare County to
Qroviile in Butte. The output was at first measured in "broken car
lots/ then by carloads, and finally it has come to be measured by
trains. â¢ \u25a0 â¢
All this time our southern friends have been cynical about tlie
Northern California orange, and in the East preconceived opinion
has held to the theory that Southern California has the monopoly of
the citrus and deciduous fruits. Now, however, it is no longer possi
ble to ignore the Northern. California citrus belt, and Pan-caliiornia
is riding into the world's notice in a chariot of oranges.
The editor of the Riverside Press, Southern California, has made
a survey of the northern citrus belt, and has communicated his obser
vations to his paper for publication. It is natural that he should be
hypercritical, but it will be observed that his criticisms run to mere
matters of practice and that he admits the one necessary fact that
the orange climate of the northern citrus belt exists and that such
. climate is- not a monopoly of Southern California. %j.
He says: "I saw at Thermalito and Palermo, in Butte County,
some groves, that are as handsome as any in Riverside. Trees of
good color, thrifty, well cared for, and bearing a crop of handsome,
thin-skinned, good-flavored fruit. The Bates and Boal grove oi
â¢sixty-five acres at. Palermo is a good example. The early fruit is
selling, November 13, for $1 85 and $2, f. o. b., which is very good.
But .judging from the condition of a majority of the groves the
average orange grower here has yet to learn the business. Yet, as I
have said, there are some fine groves, and that leads me to think
that the difficulties the growers have to contend with can be over
come; -but in general, they have not got on to the combina
tion yet. Oranges were grown in Oroville before they were in
â¢Riverside.. That statement may surprise our people, but there are
seedling- trees bearing fruit in Oroville to-day that are thirty-five
"It seems surprising to cdme over 700 miles north of Riverside
by' rail and find oranges n : early a month earlier than they are with
us. But the conditions of greater Heat in summer and warmer nights
result here, as in the Porterville country, in developing an early
orange. The fruit is not well colored yet, but is turning yellow rap
idry-and is undeniably quite well matured. I sampled navels here
and at Palermo that, while not equal to Southern California fruit
in February, are really very good. -The sugar is well enough devel
oped to make them very palatable. They will color up well in tran
sit and their sale in j.he East will not do California's reputation any
harm. No one is going to make a wry face when he eats these
oranges, and they supply a certain important demand for Thanks
giving trade.' The navels are being rushed to market and will be
practically all gone by the middle of December. Mr. Boal at Pa
lermo, when I congratulated him on his grove, said : 'I attribute my
success in large measure to the fact that I have made sixteen or
seventeen trips down to" your country and learned how to do it.'
Judging from the looks of most of the groves, other owners need to
be shown in 'some way."
He concludes that,* as the northern citrus belt shipment of fruit
has reached only 2000 carloads a year, the industry cannot be called
a success! But he "admits that the orange has fulfilled its function
as an expression of climate in Northern California, which produced a
"very palatable "orange" 700 miles north, of Riverside a month earlier
than the Southern California fruit. Given that condition, the ex
pansion of the industry is merely a matter of profit and practice. In
its reports the State Board of Trade has published the reason .of
the earl}' ripening in the Northern California citrus belt. The tem
perature is more equable than in the south. The warm days and
warm nights give a greater number of hours at the citrus temperature
in the season of growth, and development of the fruity progresses
steadily and without check.
We gladly give space to this matter, because a news dispatch
was sent from Los Angeles in November which said that ."the
people of the East will have to spend Thanksgiving without oranges.
on account of the late ripening of the Southern California crop."
The people of the East and here did not suffer that privation,
for the .Northern California citrus belt supplied them abundantly
with -"very palatable" fruit, that "did California reputation no
harm."
INSURANCE CONSCIENCES.
CONSCIENCES of Insurance managers are certainly goin<*
through a period of great awakening, and the power of pub
licity to start reform movements is clearly shown. The
wrongs which were being done policy holders would prbbably have
gone on for years "had not the methods of insurance managers been
submitted to the judgment of consciences more sensitive than those
of the officers in control. Public opinion, however, is pertinently
raising the question whether this tardy repentance and promise of
rfcform is"* going to be sufficient. The people > may want in control
of the funds men who have never been quite so dull, about the i" re
sponsibilities of fiduciary positions. fO^ll
One oi the most notable repentances and one of the ;most

TO SEE THE GIRLS GO BY
0 H, Time, from o'er thy hill of shades bring back the day I knew ;
Bring back the little village church ; bring back the "preacher," too.
There let me sit, as oft I did, and hear the parson drone
Of man's first fall, the judgment day; the lightnings round the throne.
The winter days were cold, 1 wot, but little was the harm,
For he could paint a hell so hot it served to keep us .warm.
There let me yawn till, "tenthly" past," we heard our final doom ;
Then let me haste to join the boys out in the anteroom.
â¢It was that anteroom, I fear, that le"d ; iis church to try, :\u25a0\u25a0.'.
For there we stood in shuffling rows to see the girls go by. '
t3 H, Time, if you will be so kind, turn back unto that day,
' I And let me stand with shuffling boys, and wait for Millie Ray.
Her eyes were like the shining stars or' gems that know no flaws,
Her lips were c'en the crimson bow' that only- Cupid draws;
And though a clumsy oaf was I, I'd registered a vow-
That some night I woufd see her, home/ or ask her, anyhow. \u25a0' .
Arid so I stood with shuffling boys within that anteroom,
And tried to screw my courage up to meet her spoken doom.
Alackaday ! and woe is me! or woe, at least, was I!â
Some other chump would ask her first, before the girls got by !
. j THINK I stood thus in that room some seven times or more,
* And each time . saw some other chap escort her from the door ;
And every time that other chap was one that I could liek â
1 tell you, men and brethren, that it made me mighty sick-
Yes, I could lick him, and I knew ; his name was _: Willie Drew,

MEMBERS OF FAIR SEX
VEARING THE GARB OF MEN
LEAD EXCITING LIVES
THE' death of Kate Maher at Sheri
dan, Mont., who for more than a
quarter of a century masqueraded
as a freighter, cowboy, gold seeker
and stage driver, and the arrest of Miss
Jocie Williams of Denver by a posse in
search 'of horse thieves near Vernal.
Utah, have brought to light the strange
stories of two women who preferred the
garb and "the experience of men to the
feminine attire and pursuits of their own
sex. says the Chicago Inter Ocean. _..
Kate Maher was a woman in the nrties.
and it was only due to an accident that
her sex was discovered, and then her
checkered career came to light. Miss
Williams was exculpated of the crime of
horse stealing, but was found in company
of a well known horse thief. 'She" has
since gone to a small town in Colorado to
live. Both women had characteristics In
the way of accomplishments with a rifle
or revolver which many men might have
envied and in other ways easily counter
felted the masculine character which they
assumed. ' . â¢
Kate Maher for thirty years lived,
worked, ate, drank, and gambled with the
men with whom she associated. By the
death of her father she was left an or
phan when yet In her teens. Women had
a hard time in the West. Men. did not.
Kate said this to herself after several
years' experience as servant, waiter In
hotels, and school teacher in Nebraska
and Colorado, and she must have asked
herseKcthis question: Why should I suf
fer 'hardships and privations when *by
simply putting on a man's clothing, shin
gllng my hair, and assuming a man's
name I might easily get profitable em
ployment and put an end to the miser
able way I have been living? , *
KATE MAHER DISAPPEARS.
The Question was no sooner asked than
it was answered. Kate Maher disappeared
and a few days later Edward Donovan.
a young man with slender, well-knit fig
ure, close-cropped, auburn hair, slightly
freckled, comely face, laughing gray, eyes
und a frank, pleasing manner, took her
place in the world. Nor did Kate Maher
come to light ' again as such until the
passing of the years had transformed the
pretty young girl into a homely middle
aged woman. In a . lonely little mining
camp in the â¢ .West one day last fall a
miner, whose hands were soiled and work
worn, and whose face bore the marks of
dissipation, fell ill, and in the course of
the illness. the secret which Kate Maher
had kept locked in her heart so many
years came out. The sick miner was the
same Kate Maher who had been left an
orphan on the Western border in the
early days. When the woman regained
her health she disappeared. Now she Is
dead. , . ,
. In the guise of a man Kate Maher took
up the work in which her father had lost
his life-^that of a freighter. She made
numerous trips by wagon train across the
plains and met with not a few thrilling
adventures with the hostile Indiana affd
the wild beastÂ« that roamed the great
j unsettled and uncivilized spaces of the
( West between the Missouri River and the
j Rocky Mountains. She quickly learned to
j use her six-shooter with skill, and there
! was not in the border country a surer
i shot.
i She did not long remain a freighter. The
j spirit of adventure took possession of her
and she suffered it to lead her whitherso
ever It would. Her life for the next few
years was crowded with Incident and ex
perience. Indians were giving settlers on
the border much â¢ trouble, and Kate Ma
her, under one of the numerous aliases
she assumed,- turned scout. From scout
ing * she turned to stage driving. , from
stage driving to prospecting, .from pros
pecting to cow punching, and from cow
punching again to prospecting, and from
prospecting to working in the mines as a
wage earner. She led a fast, exciting life I
during these years, and it was inevitable
that she should lose the womanly sweet
ness and graces that once were hers. Her
associates for the most part were rough,
uncouth, dissipated men, and she natur- ,
ally, enough fell into their ways and be
came addicted to their habits. She took
to smoking first. Drinking, swearing and
'gambling followed in quick succession.
And with her womanly sweetness she ,
lost her "comeliness. In the middle-aged ,
woman who died a few days ago there .
was little even suggestive of the pret|y, . - (
slender girl of thirty odd years ago, save ,
perhaps her pluck, honesty, quick wit aiftl ,
good nature.

Her life was marked by strange vlcte- Â«

times, but^she never denied her name to i

"Yes, Indeed, he could," declared her
companion earnestly. "More than once I

SAVES MIXER FROM LY.\CHERS.
Once she saved from the venzeanctT'tik
a mob a man unjustly accused of murT
der. The man had shot and killed a miner
In self-defense over a game of cards in
a notorious gambling house. Fearing
trouble, he left the resort and disappeared
from town. In the confusion of the mo
ment most of those who saw the shoot
ing got the impression that it was a cold
blooded murder..
Kate Maher. who was in the game of
cards which gave rise to the trouble,
knew that the man had killed the miner
in self-defense, and she said 30. The im
pression was popular, nevertheless, that
she was mistaken, and when the man who
did the shooting was caught a posse was
formed to lynch him.
' Despite his protestations of Innocence
he was taken out to be executed. A rcpe
was out around the man** neck and thÂ»
leader of the posse asked him If he had
anything to say before his death.
"I have something to say, gentlemen."
said Kate Maher. stepping forward, with
six shooter in hand, and deliberately re
moving the rope from the accused man's
neck. "This man Is not guilty. I saw
the shooting with my own eyes/ The first
man who lays a hand on him will have
to answer to me for it." Her gray eyes
were blazing and the posse knew she
meant, just what she said.
"By, Â» I reckon you're right." said
one of them, "and I'll stand by you."
Others came forward and expressed their
belief that the accused was Innocent, and
the lynching did not take place.
Kat* Mailer's life on the range was not
less picturesque and exciting than It w-Â»*
elsewhere. She was a superb horseworn^l

known cow punchers in the West. She

CAREER OF MISS WILLIAMS.
Mis 3 Williams was arrested at Vernal, â¢
Utah, with John Jones", a well known
horse thief.- Three horses were in the
possession of Jones, one of - which she
was riding astride, dressed in a man's
costume and heavily armed.
Miss Williams has had a checkered ca
reer. She is 22 years old and was born In
Denver, where she lived the greater part
of her life. She is rather comely when
clothed in the dress of her sex. r * is
fairly well educated. She is a i. 'dal
Western woman, however, and can ride

front of her pistol at 200 yards means

acquainted with her marksmanship. She.
formerly attended the Fruita High
School-
Miss Williams, who is said to have also
traveled under the aliases, of McCarty
md "Wilson, says she met Jones while on
â¢he way to Vernal, to which place she
started with George Beamer and his wife.
Fhe meeting with Jones took place at the
EC ranch. It was a case of love at first
sight. They started for the Ulntah reser
ration together. They were on the road
iearly two weeks before being discovered

'SPANISH NAME of "La Copa de Oro,"
the cup of gold, is assuredly the most
beautiful title whereby to call the love
ly golden poppy which we have chosen
to be the symbol flower (if California.
To elect that name to a precedence over
the harsher German term of "esch-
Bcholtzia," which later superseded the
title given by the soft Castilian tongue.
Is a lead motive in yhe beautiful new
book called "La Copa de Oro," bound in
blue and decorated with that fair gold
en California lily which the authors of
the work, the riiembers of the Pacific
Coast Women's Press Association, have
christened again with the soft and so
norous Castilian name that suits the
ilower so well.
c Whatever may be finally decided as
ihe limits of women's wider sphere,
surely no one will dispute their right
to reign among the flowers, and if they
elect 'that the golden California lily
shall be called La. Copa de Oro. let tne
..uugineut of the State be written: '"It
is so ordered." Let the outlandish,

low flowers, shall henceforth, by Hat of
the women writers of the coast, be
known with loving copiousness of
sweet sound, roundly and full-tiiroat

And, oh, adorable spirit of vibratory
resonance, how greatly will California
oratory be a gainer by this enunciation.

symbolic presentation of California, the
golden linking of the fair idea with the

the romance days of the country's
birth, the sound of the mission lan
gruage spoken when sweet religion
blessed all this land with bells and
prayers, the lover's language when
Castilian chivalry dowered the flower
with a poetic name, so that handing it

sound as La Copa de Oro.
A word as to the authors of this com
posite production: Most of them are
women who earn their daily bread by
the daily work of their pens. They j
- write for papers and magazines. They !
formed their club fifteen years agj. It i
consists of the women writers of !
Washington, Oregon, California, Utah i
and Nevada. "The object of this asso- I
elation shall be to promote itcqualnt- !
ance and good fellowship among writ- j
as and journalists; to elevate the work i
and the workers, and to forward, by j
concerted action through the press,
Euch grood objects In literary, social, in
dustrial, philanthropic and reformatory
lines as may. from time to time, pre
sent themselves."
' Mrs. Emelie Tracy Y. Parkhurst was
'the founder, and from her present home
In tne Beyond she may look back
. pleasedly to note that the members of
the club have placed the adjective "Be
loved" before her name. So very long
is the list of the names of good workers
who are, 'or have been, associated with
the co-operative copy makers that it takes
several - pages, and wide ones, to even
briefly mention these bright women
writers. If one is singled out to be
epoken of here It is just naturally that
one whom the historian of the club asso
ciation has set down in "La Copa de
Oro" as being considered "the "sweetest
singer In California literature, abroad as
well as at home." It is her poem In com
bination with the image of a glorious
grape-vine girl, who looks more of a
taint bringing blessings of plenty and
sobriety than like a dance . loving
bacchanal, which is used as frontispiece
for the book. What the ladies of the
P*Â£ss Association think of this sweetest
singer In California literature they have
expressed by echoing the sentiment of
.one of her own poems; and their appre
ciation will no doubt make of her
one of 'those truly great prophets who
strongly see to it that the thing
really comes to pass. The
poem is called, "When the Grass Shall
'Cover Me." and wishes. this:
.Wbn the grass shall cover me,
Hrad to feet where I am lying;

it was wisely decided to make the ven

i I like this paragraph in the foreword:
i "Perhaps had each individual contributor
'. realized that her mite of prose or verse
was to have a wider cognizance than
that at the moment intended, she might
have endeavored to do betterâ and have
done worse." The fore part of that
sentence, that Is all except what is
done after the dash, sounds like earthly
wisdom of fine quality: but what came
after the dash was an inspiration; .It
was a wisdom sent from otherwhere. It
is a waste of time to interminably re
write things. It may be well to have a

Outdoor Pastimes
of American Hunter
In his new. book, "Outdoor. Pastimes of
an American Hunter," President Roose
velt makes of himself a combination
sportsman, naturalist, sociologist and
statesman. These . being characteristics
of the man himself, it Is natural they
should show forth in his authorship.. His
talk about the hunting of the wild ani
mals is the main issue, of course, but tie
takes occasion to | tell about the advan
tages of 'outdoor life and roughing it to
develop and to keep in training Â£ the
strength of manhood that V renders each
one a : potential Â» soldier, the endurance,
self-denial and resourcefulness of the ar
dent hunter making the essential founda
tion upon .which, in time of sudden. need,
the technical training will rapidly develop
the eflicient \u25a0 volunteer fighter. . He dedi
cates his volume to : John ; Burroughs in
appreciation of that I naturalist's \ love lof
outdoor | life -and his ; fidelity.* to truthful
ness in writing, about the denizens of the
woods and plains. ' %
.'\u25a0\u25a0 It is . a - large book and contains about
fifty full-page pictures of "\u25a0\u25a0 hunting' and
ranch scenes. It consists of twelve chap
ters, /five of which have been recently
written, and the others have been revised
and added to since; their original aopear
â¢ ance. There are accounts of adventures
with ; J the '.f cougar, : hounds, | Colorado bear
hunts, wolf-coursing, hunting ' the prong
horn, ' shooting : at j moun tain ; sheep, < and
various kinds of deer, I . the wapiti O r round

to f develop \ nerve ?: for \ real fighting when
it becomes; necessary.
; The : President / has a ' most . interesting
way of telling .the details of. his trips,
which ; gives . his - narratives something of
the '.'\u25a0 smack lot ; a \u25a0 talk .by the ; camp - fire.'
For ;; Instance, he .' tells :of the various
characters; of the -dogs so as to bring us
Into " Intimate , acquafntance with , them.
This .is a feature . that will make the vol
ume; a great delight to boys.'- The author
goes . into three details so naturally that
it is almost like having the -teller of the
yarn close at .hand. so. that we- could
question him about the little items that
rouse our -curiosity. Probably this qual
ity 'of ' the narrating art Is an instinct
that has. been cultivated: by having chil
dren-; of hlsi own at home " to / put the
queries necessary r to ' round out the tale.
An interesting /picture is" of Stewart,
high up in the top qx ; a" tree," and in the
act; of taking a photograph of a big bob
cat, which is quite close enough to jump
on the man's throat. 'Another is of Aber
nethy,\the expert, wolf hunter,' who* could
catch a live, coyote -by the, Jaws with
such swiftness and dexterity â¢ that it
could . not "bite his \u25a0 hand. : This was' his
regular method of " catching live coyotes.
He would run them down on horseback
and then seize them by the ( lower ] jaw
just behind" the teeth. Some other in
teresting illustrations are of the half
tame grizzly bears in the wilderness pre
serves, where sometimes the cooks and
the chambermaids make pets of the big
bears which come out from the forests -to
feast on the scraps around human habi
tations.
A ; description of a sojourn in Northwest
Colorado, hunting cougars, is one of the
best narratives. Fourteen of them were
killed, and one was an immense # male,
weighing 227 pounds and measuring"elght
feet from tip to tip. The President says
that the cougar Is as large, as powerful
and as formidably armed as the Indian
panther, and quite as well able to at
tack man, and . yet the instances of his
having done so are exceedingly ; rare. If
you , wish a glimpse of one of the fights,
here is one with the biggest cougar:
â¢ â¢ he continued his flight, the hounds not
venturing to meddle with him. and he paying
little heed to them. It was a different mat
ter, however, with Turk and Queen along. He
went uu the hill and came to bay on the top
of the cliffs, , where we could see him agaiiuc
the sky line. The hounds surrounded him.
but neither they nor Turk came to' close quar
ters. 'Quern, however. ' as soon as she ar
rived rushad straight in, â¢ and the cougar
knocked her a dozen feet off. Turk tried to
seize him as . soon as Queen made her rush;
the cougar broke bay. and they all disappeared
over the hilltop, while we- hurried after
them. : A quarter of a mile beyond they at'ain
had him up a pinyon-tree. He stood in such
an 'awkward position that I could not get a
fair shot at the heart, but the bullet broke
his back. ] and the dogs seized - him as he
struck the ground. There was still any amount
of fight in him. â¢ â¢ every minute's delay
meant the chance of a doe being : killed or
crippled. It was a day of misfortunes for Jim,
who was . knocked completely out of the fight
by 'â¢ -\u25a0 single blow. The cougar was too , big
for the dogs to master, even crippled as he
was; but when T came up close Turk ran In
and got the beast by one ear, stretching out
the ' cougar's head, while he â¢ kept his own
forelegs tucked away back Â«o the cougar could
not set hold of them. .This gave me my
chance, and I drove the knife home, leaping
back before the creature could get round at
me. . V â¢ .

Ta/es of the Road
Told by a Traveler
"Tales of the Road," by. the commercial
traveler, Charles N. Crewdson, would
have benefited by aâ¢' sub-title to
more ' clearly indicate the nature of the
work. Brevity is a virtue, of course,
whenever it is the shortest line to the
point to be got at, but it should surely be
long enough to reach the point. This ex
cellent book is in danger both of robbing
itself of some of Its most successful pos
sible sales and of misleading some buyers
by the brevity of its title. I am using
the expression successful sales not in the
ordinary, or mediocre commercialism
sense, but in that very high sense of com.
merciallsm which the whole spirit of the
volume moves to Inculcate. The most suc
cessful sales are the ones that brinx the
book direct to those who are in need of
literature of that type, and thereby so
benefit the buyer that the seller's success
is bftlt up on a solid foundation of jus
tice.
"Tales of the Road" might be taken,
from* the title, by a hurried buyer to be
aj. collection of yarns whose * motive was
to amuse. It Is not that exactly; but it is
far more than that. It tells of the road
to right success; and it is the philosophy
of a successful j salesman who expounds
by. the aid of anecdote how modern busi
ness methods can link 'pure ethics with
practical accomplishment in money-mak
ing enterprises. Briefly put it is tales of
the road. - illustrating the power -of
straight over , crooked business ways.
As - 1 remember,, it, David Starr Jordan
teaches something to the effect that to
realizlnglv know a straight line is the
shortest- way between tyo points Is the
chief lesson with which the most elab
orate education can dower us; it is the
very /essence of the; art of life. Crewd
son has been on the road long enough to
apply this - principle to the art of sales
manship. He tells all Â» would-be success
ful salesman that via the straight road U
the way to get there. -Truly, if he travels
any other road he won't know "where he
is at", when he thinks he's there. What
a '\u25a0' relief i this book -is after the flood \u25a0: of
what might be called pessimistic business
literature which pictures to us the typical
strong," successful, ; modern business man
as an artful dodger of ethical â¢ principles
who V Dlacatfls his conscience ; . with the
sophism \ that self-defense In keen compe-'
titlon^; compels : combating a real devil's
He I with -some , analogous falsehood by a
non-satanic gentleman who" is Just an
artificial : devil f or ; the nonce. â¢
. Crewdson Is a,. busy . ; salesman of the
road,' who uses \ his leisure to - write en
tertainingly ; and Instructively ; about [ busi
ness life' and business methods. : He is
as .quick '(as chain", lightning /and; if ? I

The ; philosophy: embodied In {. the " tal es,
however,*, is Z of -. wide '/enough sweep?to

such use .the book isto be recom
mended. Considered merely as a collec
tion of drummers^ yarns told only to
amuse for amusement's own sake, the
volume could not be ;so much -praised.
It la not intended to>be tales of the road
in that sense. It must "not be thousht
that Crewdson is maintaining: that mod
ern commercialism is generally carried on
upon a high plane of ethics. He is say
ing- that It ought to be, and that it can
be successfully so. Consider how ably
he expresses that double truth in this
single sentence: "Were merchandise sold
strictly on merit, two-thirds of the whole
sale houses and factories would soon lock
up; and the other third would triple their
business."
Speaking in his chapter on "How to Get
on the \ Road," he shows the opportunity
for talent thus:. "Almost any large firm
-would . put on . ten men to-morrow, \u25a0 but
they can't find the men." Here Is one of
the most pithy sentences in the book:
"Generally any fool can do what he is
told to do: but It takes a man of sense
to find things to , do. and if he has the
grit to do them he will get along."
. He tells of a man who succeeded by
following the advice his father gave. him
as a boy making his first start out: "Son,
be polite:, this will cost you nothing and
be ' worth lots." There is a very ex
cellent chapter on "Salesman's Don'ts"
Among ithem are these: "Don't think any
one too big or too hard for you to tackle."
"Don't run down your Competitor."
"Don't fail to be friendly with any one
who comes in your way." "Don't be
ashamed that you are a salesman." .
To make a culminating close I will
give you this one. It's about the suc
cessful man at the head of a great busi
ness house. A few years ago they had
the watchword: "Watch usâ five millions'
a year." Now the watchword is: "A
million a month." and by their methods
they will soon be there. Crewdson closes
the sketch of this man by saying: "He
knows one thing that few men in busi
ness do know, that a man can best help
, himself by helping others."

Story of a Good Man
by Albert E. Lyons
The dedication of the new book,
"Mister Bill," by Albert E. Lyons, Is
so good an indication in epitome of the
nature of the work that to Quote it, in
dorsed as such, is to quickly give a re
view of the book that will straightly
guide the inquirer for a story to read
as to whether this one would suit' the
mood of the searcher and satisfy his
quest. The sub-title of the story is
briefly "A Man," and when that word
is put in that way we know it means
virility in the sense in which the *"vlr"
of that and the "vir" of virtue holds
manhood linked by this like derivative to
the definition given of the first knights
of the Order of the Garter, who were
"valiant and virtuousâ of a haughty
courage â not fearing death nor sink
ing in distress â but. always resolute In
worst extremes." > -*": ji"
The dedication is to a man who.
the author assures me, is really one of
our human fellow creatures, and by his
character and life suggested the writ
ing of this novel and was the proto
type of its hero. The story is about
such a man as the dedication indicates:
"Some men are strong â gentle in
their strength; quick to forgiveâ slow
to condemn; giving but asking noth
ing in returnâ doing because it is for
them to do. The world is better that
they have lived. Jo the memory of
such a man, whose companionship was,
and ever will be, a strength and in
spiration, this book is dedicated."
The novel was not written by a pro
fessional literary - manâ do not get it
if you are looking for that â It is a sim
ply told story, composed in the leisure
hours of a traveling salesman, who
has been at the pains of improving the
time he was off duty by studying to
qualify himself to write. The Mr.
Bill of the story, or rath .Â»â¢ his original,
so enriches the life of the author by
the Inspiration of his manliness that
the writer' believed such simple,
straightforward portraiture of him as
this story gives. would be of worth to
the world. Aside from the literary
skill and experience that go into the
making of a book the spirit in which it
is written will always add much to its
value *In the appreciation of the ma
jority of readers. . The* motive that
moved the composition of this work
was such a. spirit as we can believe
the character outlined in the dedication
would naturally imbue his sincere ad
mirers with.' â¢
It is about an American, who is a
product of both the West and the East,
one who absorbed the best to be got
from each environment and so com
mingled In his blood and nature the rug
ged virtue of the West and the power
of refinement of the East. The commer
cial traveler thinks that It has "An ex
cuse for being," which expression is a
rather modest form of ralson d'etre.
Mister Bill was engaged in large mining
operations and concerned with big rail
road . building schemes, â¢ and to hold out
for. his own and for laboring men's rights
he was drawn into conflicts with over
bearing and corrupt . capital which re
quired strong courage and steadfast
virtue to make the successful leader be
proved to be. Upon one occasion he sur
prised ; a young man by paying out four
thousand dollars to save him from dis
grace. _ Mister Bill thought the erring
young fallow and his family had qualities
that - made it worth while to save them.
He thus explains his act:
".'-'I have not inconvenienced myself. I
will, however, * offer you one suggestion.
You ' have sufferedâ suffered deeply. Re
member this, when you meet any of, your
fellows in distressâ man or womanâ do
not refuse them at least, a little
assistance. Go out of your way to do a
good', turn. "Give 'according to your
means. Even a cup of coffee will some
times put new life^ Into a discouraged
stomach, and you can never tell when
even'aklnd word will make the world
seem brighter and perhaps give new hope
to a weary soul. You can always 'afford
both, and .the ' good you _ are able to do
forTothers "will help; you' to forget your
own troubles, and expiate the wrong you
have done. . Try It."

It might be said of these sayings
about courage, especially because so
many of them are from men and)
women who have put the value to per
sonal proof and have succeeded in
spite of all discouragement, and hava
the literary talent â¢to express the ex
perience taught truths In an impressive
way. that they cannot be read too often
until repetition has made them known
by heart. It is probably true that the
great majority of men. If they were

they could possess in full abundance,

to victory.
From all this cream of quotations I
will select a few to give you an im
pression of the book's worth and of
the value of courage. Knowtes says
in his preface that courage may be ex
hibited by men of every faith, but its . ,
quality is undoubtedly affected by the
attitude of the mind toward questions
of belief. For Instance, the courage dC

Beyond his love and care.
Perhaps it is the people who are beinj
tried by failure that most need the en
couragement of courage, and Browning,
is the especial poet for all such. Here 1*
just one of his many on . that point:
But what if I fail of my purpose hens?
It la but to keep ttie nerves at strain. â¢\u25a0 Â»

So the chase takes up one's life., that's all.
This is from Charles F. Dole: â¢â¢
"Chivalry never makes bargains. * It â¢
never asks to be paid in advance or .
thanked. The chivalrous friend is never * >
assured beforehand that his friendship
will pay."
. Emerson cays: "It is defeat whlcK
educates us," and also "Valour consists
In the power of self recovery." Maurice
Maeterlinck says, "No great inner event
befalls those who summon it not."
Eraenon again: "The characteristic of
genuine heroism is Its persistency. Aif
men have wandering impulses, fits and
starts of generosity. But when you
have resolved to be great, abide by your
self. â¢ â¢'* ;A^ r -^
T. Southern asserts that "there Is no
courage but In innocence: no constancy
but in an honest cause." Phillips Brooks
says: "Do not dare to live without some
clear Intention toward which your living
shall be bent." And this: "Self-con
sciousness is at the root of every
cowardice. To think about one's sell is
death to real thought about any noble,
thing."
To close, consider this selection from
Tennyson anent the Christmas bells:

awaits the lino:, which for many years
has been almost part of the life of the
people in the Sandwich Islands.* When the
AJamed-a arrives off Diamond Head the
Honolulu clocks will all be set right and
Jfe at the island port will once again re
curae its regularity.

SHOOTS A MAN
JUST AS AN "AD"
Edward Terr^ iills Chinese
in /New Zealandf to
Attention 'to His Book
MA Y: COST" HIM> DEAK
Takes This Mjeans of Trying
to Arouse Interest in Ques
tion of the Yellow Peril
Soeclal Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
LONDON," Dec. : 2.â Facts : that have
just come'out;here,shed an interesting
light 'on . the .careeer" and character of
Edward Lionel Terry, the, young* author,
who shot a Chinese in* New! Zealand to
advertise his book and ;call' attention, to
the darigrer of the "Yellow Peril.". Ac
cording to his father, who is a wealthy
real estate agent "and. mortgage' broker
in- London/ he is descended from' :a
French' refugee who .was an illegiti
mate t offspring -of ,tht~; great Napol%on
and changed;- his > name- f rom Thiery to
Terry after settling; in England.
."Several* persons s have. commented |on
ray likeness to Napoleon,"- ; said the
father the other day,- "and the inflexible
will of the conqueror of \u25a0 Europe, has
been reproduced in my. son.. I never
knew him Uo : ; turn laside .from any
course oh which he had (determined.^ No
own could -bend or break his will. ;He
would always have his own way." j
And tliat way-has how brought- him
within the! shadow ofi the" gallows, at
the [age of 31. " . Whether or no there
runs Napoleonic blood in his veins, Ed
ward Lionel Terry is certainly, an ex
traordinary\u25a0\u25a0.man, who, in different
times and under different circumstances
might have done great~things. Physi
cally, .he is; a' magniricerit specimen of
stalwart .manhood, standing well over
six feet," and -.with'' a handsome face.
: He was convinced that Chinese im
migration' constituted the 5 greatest
menace to the British Empire. Failing
to arouse public opinion by his lectures
and writings against it, he deliberately
resolved to compel attention to it', by
killing-. a Chinese. -He purpoÃely^ chose
as the victiim of hisfanaticisth an old
and. decrepit man. to whom, he believed,
life could^only be; a burden. The deed
sat lightly on his 'conscience. V It did
not even affect his appetite.". He dirie'd
well that night j with \u25a0 some friends j and
it' was 'observed that .h e was.in unusti-.
ally good spirits. Before going. to bed
he wrote 'this letter to the; Governor,
Lord Plunkett: . . .- '\u25a0 -
'.'Sirâ Haying sppnt several years in".va
rious portions of the: British Empire .in
quiring .into; the results arising from .alien'
immigration, and being conviriced:'of ; the
evil . consequences arising therefrom^,/ 1
have decided to brint the. matter' before
the public, eye in , a manner which will
compel attention. To make this decision
perfect I have this â¢evening- put a;China
mari to death in Haining street." ' . '
CHEERFUL AFTER DEED.
He "wasi still' bright and cheerful next
morning: arid after eating a hearty break
fast he called /at a bbokseller's and made
inquiries about; the sale of his. book; '.'The
Shadow." ' I He^' wa^ told that -there .had
not I been â¢ much i inqliiry. after ; it, and ; only
a few" copies of It had \ been, sold; (/^ \u25a0 {â¢
"I think ; you , will '\u25a0 find} that ,'it 'will . sell
better. 'â¢ to-morrow," , he \u25a0\u25a0; remarked; ; and
then went to the, police station and; gave
himself 'up/ There : was no I warrant out
tor his ; ; arrest; for nobody , hadj seen [ him
shoot lthe Chinese. Suspicion hev&r
have fallen on him; ' and ; he., might \u25a0 easil y
have escaped. V but that; would, haVe de.
featcd his purpbse."/:He;was quite? as .will
ing, tosacriflce himself to his convictions
as he had been to sacrifice" an unoffending
Chinese.-,/ - '" y--y'...;:\ : - K y. '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0 "-.i^''-'-*S /"

toat ll;e sfclngle mills will commence to close
down L>ecÂ«mber 1 es p*r their sixty day egr~e

tion, but It skeins to a casual observer that
lhat r*riod is short about thirty or sixty
.days. Conditions laust be in a far better
..status than for soraf yÂ«ars past if sixty days'
-.curtailment will solve the wobk'm of over
; production. The mi!!* wi'l be ch>s<M to curtail

the same as those, of yesterday. ; Very little
stock comes out whenever the market is -weak

ENGLAND DEALS
TRUST A BLOW
Tobacco Monopoly Must Pay
Eleyen Millioii Dollars
for Its Frenzied Finance
HAED HIT BY COURTS
Dealers Unite to Press the
Case A gainst the American
Firm and Win in the End
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 2. â American. trusts of
every description have just received a
severe blow in England. The decision
given in the Court of Appeal in the liti
gation brought against "Ogdens 1 Lim
ited," the great tobacco firm, by retail
tobacconists, will have, a far-reaching
Influence on every .American industry
which attempts to establish a monopoly
in England. ' ;
Retail tobacconists are jubilating
over their really great' victory. They
will be able to compel the trust started
in England by Duke to disgorge the
best part of $7,500,000, and besides this
the trust will have to pay an additional
$3,500,000 â making the colossal total of
$11,000,000.
The legal fight has been one of the
most gigantic battles of the law courts;
though the proceedings have as yet at
tracted little public attention. The
next step in the litigation, however,
when the assessing of damages goes
before a British Jury, will undoubtedly
be the one topic of conversation among
smokers all over the world. - .
The man who has conducted the fight
on behalf of the 4500 retail tobacconists
organized to oppose the Duke combine
is Henry Jerrold Nathan, chairman > of
the Ogden's Bonus Association. Seen
at bis office, 10 Throgmorton avenue,
Nathan said: . â¢
"Our organization, the Ogden's Bonus
Association, is ; the only company ever
formed for the express purpose of liti
gation. We have won, hands down;
and all the private dealers in; England
are rejoicing over our defeating a trust
with $265,000,000 at its backâ l mean
the American Tobacco Trust, y. ;-,
"When Mr. Duke' came to England
four years ago as the representative of
the trust, he bought out Ogdens by
offering the English' tobacco, company.
$1,000,000 a year for. if our years; and
the whole of the net profits; and at the
same time he obtained agreements from
4500 tobacconists that they would, not
deal with any other concern. When he
had all these agreements he disposed of
the -goodwill of Ogdens, which, of
course, carried the signatures of .the
tobacconists to the Imperial Tobacco
Co., 1 for $7,500,000.- He then sent a
check to each of the tobacconists, with
a circular, telling him he was no longer
in business, the* check being the pro
portion of the $1,000,000 for. the first
year. < . .
''This high-handed" proceeding result
ed in my forming the Ogden's Bonus
Association for the purpose of claiming,
the undistributed bonus (as agreed by
Duke) of $3,500,000, and also the four
years' profits. 'We went to law. over
the matter and won. ; Duke carried: the
'matter \u25a0,upi'on> appeal, and^every t Judge
confirmed the- lower' courtr/lri^facC I ; the"
appeal was contemptuously
with costs, \u25a0which are very heavy. The
trust was ordered to pay not: only our
claim on the bonus proposition, but the
full amount' of the profits. The result
is that it has been decided ,we are fully
entitled to the balanceâ s3,soo,ooo ; and
also -the best part of the. million and
a half sterlingâ s7,soo,oooâ as good
will. " ':' :". ': '-." : : ,>'. " : \ r AV. S
"The action of the Tobacco
Trust in this' matter has affected the
standing of every American business in
England. Up to this time English busl-,
ness men : have regarded the trusts as
straightforward business enterprises
seeking fields of : legitimate exploita
tion. The deliberate attempt of the to
bacco: trust to stand from under its ob
ligations has made "business men in
England distrustful of American integ
rity. , It will- take English dealers a
long time to "recover from this blow.
"We are sure , of getting our money
from the trust, as it is all in: this coun
try and they cannot get out of paying.
Naturally, our association* isolated at
the prospect of, getting-nearly $11,000,
000 out of the.trust; â¢ The'lastiphase of
the case, unless, it:ls carried t to; : the
House of. Lordsâ and there ; is \ little
chance of thatâ -is the of
damages before a j Brltislv jury. Under
the circumstances, there Is no reason
to believe the .jury will be any too
lenient. , : . : ';.; \u25a0
"Our victory will not necessarily re
duce the price of, tobaccoâ at least r not
just at -presentâ -though * something in
this direction may result later, on. We
have broken the strength ;of , the trust
in England." ; . j-: - \u25a0'.... '. \u25a0

PLEASING PLAY
BY MRS. RYLEY
"Mrs. Grundy" Is Produced
in London by Forbesj Rob
ertson arid Gertrude Elliott
PRAISED BY CRITICS
New- Drama, However, Said to
Be Not; of as High Order
as Authors' "Mice and Men"
Special Â©ispatch to The C*U.
LONDON, Dec. 2.â When the final
curtain fell. on Madeleine Lucette Ry
ley's new play, s "Mrs. Grundy," there
was) hardly a single "boo"- and most
of : the .critics , speak kindly of the
American authoress' latest offering, and
opine that prosperity will be its lot.'
AH of which is pleasing, for both Mrs.
Ryley and Forbes Robertson, who. pro
duces "Mrs. Orundy,'.' are in a position
to welcome a bit of good luck. They
both scored last with "Mice and Men,"
since when the authoress has written
two plays .which did \ not go, while the
actor and his â¢ American wife and part
ner, Gertrude Elliott, have, produced
a whole series of failures., *
So : now we have the original com
bination making another bid for; for
tune with a play ' of much the same
order as "Mice and Men," but, unfortu
nately, not so sympathetic, : though | one
that is vastly better written, for neith
er in "An American Citizen" nor "The
Mysterious .Mr. Bugle" has Mrs. -Ry
ley given us wittier. lines than those in
whictf T "Mrs. ..Grundy" abounds. There
are agreeable episodes, too, and inge
nious businessâ everything. In fact, but
the appeal to the sympathies that was
made by "Mice and Men." [ One can feel
for an elderly bachelor losing," the
sweet" girl that he has trained jup to
be his wife, but not for a blundering
parson who prefers spoiling three
lives to clouding one such as the hero
of "Mrs. Grnndy."
tICAR HERO OF PLAY.
.The Rev. Edward Sotheby,;, who is a
widower; with a small son, has. Just be
come vicar of a small town in the English
midlands. -, On beginning his pastorate,
the first thins he does is to fall in loye,
and the second is to interest himself in a
mild scandal. The object of his affection
is the charming: lady who owns his vicar
age.-She : calls herself "Mrs. Patullo,"
and-; frequently' hints : at a husband Vr ln
the bush," : but in reality she is an un
married I heiress and "Mrs. Patullo" . is a
myth designed to protect her against
fortune hunters. But, of course, the new
vicar; doesn't know this. ,'
â¢ The local scandal has' been caused by
Miss Kitty Barson. She is a poor but
pretty dependent of the wealthiest family
in the, neighborhoodâ the Jevons. j Amelia
Jevons," the daughter of the house, has
for some time Leen engaged to Will Tap
plethwaite, but on seeing the Jevonses*
pretty, governess he has transferred .'his
affectlo'ns to her. She loves : him, too,
but loyalty to her cousin makes her repel
his advances. One night, however, when
he is on the point of : starting for ; Scot
land, his fiancee being on a. visit to. the
Riviera, for the time, he gets Miss Barson
to â¢ Dromise y to . see him off , from the \u25a0 sta
.tion.'; And there", working jon her ; love for
him, he persuades her to elope; to go with
, him fc to Scotland ; ahd^'be: married ..there as
soon'ai ' practicable. \ In- the ; train^the girl
f alls I asleep and *on awakening â¢ finds her
self in Edinburgh. I There she" sees , things
In a', new. light; again,'refuses to- "wrong",
her cousin | by marrying ] the < man. and \u25a0 re
turns ' home by the"? first- train. >j \u25a0
But she V has been \ ' away a over twenty
four hours and ) her :I reputation , is â¢ the
worse for. it. The : Jeyonses will not take
her back, and she goes\to the vicar, for
advice. t To begin .with,, he gets her quar
tered ; with : "Mrs. â¢ Patullo,'* \u25a0 his j lady-love,
who is sympathetic, and the reason given
in the play to explain : why the girl can
riot stay ' there ; Indefinitely .- is not j a good
one. However," next morning she Is,with
out a home," so the. vicar decides. to take
her iuto his. household as nurse to his
little, boy. -Mrs.- Grundy will .talk; well,
let her."~- :\u25a0"".; '.â¢\u25a0''":".\u25a0 â¢ :. ''..' ;; \u25a0-
LOVE FINALI.V "WINS. >
But Wi'U'Tapplethwaite,- piqued at first,
has raced -back from Scotland .to , be-by
his sweetheart's side; He wants to marry
her, but \ she bids him go Ito his , fiancee
at San Renio. And i the ..vicar backs her
up. The man who loves Kitty,Barsdn and
whom she loves is a scoundrel for wishing
to break . his engagement ' and marry her.
He is bidden "never, to darken the clergy
man's door again; . \
But. the vicar's battle with, Mrs. Grundy
does not go well. The girl's presence at
the vicarage is making disagreeable talk,
and his church is deserted, his schemes of
charity! go awry for; '-lack . of support and '
his converts '"backslide." .So he h*as the
heroic idea of marrying, Miss Barson and
thus silencing- the spiteful A tongues.' 4 He"
would not do this did he i know that: his
real 'lady-love were freeâ and, of, course,
that lady' does riot tell. him so until just
after he has proposed to Kitty and been
accepted.'; ; . : .
: Previously Miss : Barson -, had advertised
for another ; Vsituation," but now It ,- is
arranged - that she shall j go . to Cornwall,'
the vicar following a few days later,. and
that they should be married there.- Mean
while the: bare fact leaks v out \ that the
girl is leaving. the v vicarage, and thiÂ»
seems to make -_ all f the difference. , The
communltiy - "comes round.". The vicar
Is asked to garden parties again.
Just after Kitty Barson has learned for,
the first time that the clergyman is really;

Professor of Chicago -TJniyer
f sity Delivers Interest
ing Address.
CHICAGO, Dec. 2.â ln an address at
the opening session of the annual meet
ing of the Central Association of
Science and Mathematics teachers yes
terday Professor Thomas Crowder
Chamberlin of the University of Chi
cago outlined his recently announced
"accretion theory" of the earth's origin,
which If accepted 1 by scientists will
overthrow the so-called "nebular :hy-"
pothesis" I and * do ' away with most of
the ideas commonly, held as to the or
igin of ; the earth and other planets.
; According to the "nebular hypothe
sis." or Laplace theory, which has been
held for more than a century, the earth
and the other planets originally were
masses of molten matter thrown oft
from the sun by its whirling motion
and , gradually cooled to their present
condition. { This theory Professor
Chamberlin attacks on; the assumption
that the sun never had a whirling ve
locity sufficient- to throw off such bod
ies., .\u25a0-";-.. . . . *
Professor Chamberlin's theory is that
a disturbance was caused in our sun
by the near approach of or collision
with; some other sun/ which drew off
projections -of nebulous matter from
our sun and gave - them a rotary mo
tion by. its own attraction as it passed.
These - particles of matter then grad
ually gathered -together to form the
planets. V The internal heat of . the
earth, -says Professor Chamberlin, de
veloped by^ compression as .the body

WASHINGTON*, Dec 2. â Some un

- Princeton to Waahlngrton. Tbe missile,

Fragments ~of broken glass fell on
Major Hayes, \u25a0who â¢was sitting with his
back <Q*tfae window, reading, but did
\u25a0 net . Injure him in any way. Major
Hayes stooped and picked up the iron
missile so narrowly had missed
his head", "and then arose and examined
'the broken window. The frame of the
\u25a0window â¢was broken where the plumb
bob had .struck it. so great was the
force wtth which it had been hurled.
The train at' that time, about 7:30
o'clock., was. running at a comparatively
. flow rate. The weather was heavy and
c dense fog which prevailed rendered it
. tlmosi; impossible for the engineer to see
; a train lerasrth_ ahead of him. Broad
' street, in .North Philadelphia, had just
tieen' crossed and the train was in the
vicilijty of Oxford street when the crash
'"of glass .arpused the occupants of the
car, I**? 6 Salvius was the first car of the
Train, and in appearance might have been
mistaken very easily for President Roose-
I Veil's private car. That, however, was
et the ;rear. of the train.
RESEMBLES MR. ROOSEVfcXT.
-"It *wa4 ' remarked, ,;il.so, that Major
Hayes, from a" -profile view, strongly re
eembles the President, and that, sitting
at the. window in the position he occupied
In reading." he "might have been mistaken
for .President Roosevelt.
Do.ulj t, was expressed by officials of the
Pennsylvania 'ftallroad who were on the
train. as -to whether it was intended to
hur! the mis-ile at the President. They,
- nay that several times recently stones
ihave. beijn. thrown at trains passing
throi/gh North. Philadelphia, and on one
<K-casion a man sitting at one of ihe win
dows* of a car- was severely cut by broken
g-Jags â¢* when a heavy stpne crashed
through it. . â¢ â¢ '

\u25a0 to-night was a mofct unusual one to be

some irresponsible person. As a mea
eure of 'precaution the curtains at the
windows, of several of the cars were
drawn down- a"fter the jiewe of the out
rage spread among the passengers on
the train. .
HOPE TO PUNISH GUILT Y ONE.
The 'secret service officers who ac
companied the President took charge
"of the missile and an effort will be
made through tbe secret service bureau
â¢ to aj>pr # ehend the person who threw, it.
A report of -the -incident was made by

were on board the train at least a half

officers did not want to take the chance
of starting ' the special train until* the

RUDDERLESS ROANOKE ARRIVES WITH ALL ON BOARD WELL
DISABLED COASTER REACHES PORT TINDER HER OWN STEAM
Trailing Log Used
to Steer the
Heavy Gale Safely
Weathered by ,
Passengers Say the
Experience Was
Enjoyable.
The disabled steamship Roanoke, with
her fifty-six passengers In good health
and high spirits, came limping into port
yesterday, relieving the anxiety of those
who had allowed the ill-advised scare
heads of the Examiner to cause them un
rest In regard to. the vessel's safety'and
confirming the opinion of the marine un
derwriters that (the vessel was all right.
There never was any reason for alarm.
The Roanoke is a stanch vessel, and ex
cept for the loss of her rudder was â¢ un
injured. It was known that her. engines
were In good , condition, that Cap
tain P. J. Dunham was a good
seaman and the people | who understand
knejw that, while a rudder is mighty'con
venient, a good sailorman \u25a0 can devise
plenty other means to 1 steer his vessel. In
a heavy sea life on a rudderless ship, is
apt to be uncomfortable," and :no speed
records can be broken without the ortho
dox steering apparatus in good working
order. .But between discomfort and.dan
ger there is a wide margin, although the
landlubber's eye may not always be able
to distinguish' the chasm. ; ., \u25a0
The Examiner's cruel: suggestion that
the Roanoke had been lost and that pa
per's publication ! of . the names \u25a0 of '\u25a0 the
passengers, inclosed: in a black ." border,'
caused the shadow of unnecessar yf grief
to darken many /homes. Every telephone
at the Merchants' " Exchange was: kept!
busy for several . : hours , yesterday- morn- 5
ing and until almost<noon the. clerks did
little else than assure grief-crazed women
that : the Roanoke was all' right : ,that she
had been sighted; and would; be; in the
harbor in a few hours. ,
; DISTRACTED AVOMEXV
When' the Chief Wharfinger's V office
opened about 6:30 ; o'clock ... a: m. \u25a0 It'{ was
besieged by weeping women and' children
who had awakened \u25a0 to read. in a ; mor.nihg
paper that the vessel* on which fath*er or
brother or sister was working or, .travel
ing was "thought to have sunk in a*gale.',V
It was expected that the Roanoke would'
be slow. , Conflicting reports of captains
that thought they had sighted her made
it uncertain in which direction she was
heading, and it was feared that the pas
sengers: might be reduced to pretty sim
ple diet, but the thought that anything
serious had befallen' the vessel was never
entertained by the men in the shipping
world whose opinion is worth anything.
The Roanoke is an iron hulled vessel
and her seams would hardly Vopen up,"
as the Examiner said they had, nor could
she very well ."float bottom up," which
that same paper suggested, as the Roa
noke's lot if she was not "at the bottom
of the sea."
The Roanoke, however, did have quite
a lively time of it.
She left Portland last Sunday. She was
crossing the Humboldt bar at 3 o'clock
Monday afternoon when a huge sea
slapped across her stern and carried away
rudder and rudder-post. "Fortunately, the
tide was ebbing and by- the 'judicious use
of the head -sails Captain Dunham was
able to work his vessel out through the
south channel into the \u25a0 open sea.- .
CAPTAIX DUXHAM COOL.
Captain Dunham talks quietly about
what happened on the Humboldt bar, and
his passengers say he was just as undis
turbed when "doing things" as in talking
about them afterward. . But the ' passen
gers will never, forget, those few minutes
in those troubled waters. . '
â¢ The sea which smashed the . rudder was
followed by others .which swept the
coaster's decks. One sea* broke in- a port
on. the starboard side and dropped Third
Officer Peter Edwards, / bruised " and
soaked Ho the skin, right in the middle
of the steam steering gear. .
The passengers were herded in "â¢ the sa
loon, where Purser M. B. f Behrenz de
voted himself , to allaying their, fears. .The
Roanoke was drawing :. nineteen ; feet.
There : was but twenty feet of depth lin
the south channel, and: several times.the
steamer bumped the bottom. But she'got
clear all right and stood : off-3hore, where
she .was joined later, by the tug Ranger
from Eureka.: ,'..' \u25a0;:,;\u25a0' ;":=", ..'â¢
Captain; Dunham decided that, he could
make ; San Francisco under, jury rudder,
and the next morning a' temporary steer
ing apparatus was rigged.!; It served 'until
evening, when a southeaster came
along. One of the first: seas put, the jury

CALLIbUREAT, POST BUILDIXG,
WASHIXGTOX, Dec. 2. â President
KooseveJt has ..written, a- messase-to
Cungres.i full of confidence, as to the
future, breathing a deep spirit of Amer
icanism' 'dealing, with those questions
which he has thrust to the front In ad
vance of his pnrtj- and proposing rem
edies 7 with r cnlm reliance; In the ca
pacity' of Congress to handle them.
;It is a .very long message. - Perhaps
such a \u25a0 long", message . has never been
written by: a. President^to Congress.
The â¢= newspaper .that. prints it ell will
have to issue' a* supplement.
Thepartof the message which will
attract the 'most attention, because .it
deals with : wliat has -been; made . by ; the
President > the . "paramount issue" in
American- politics, Is that devoted to
the discussion of the railroad question.
Generally- the views of the President as
to remedies, are those which were given
by Senator Knox of .Pennsylvania inhis
Pitt sburg 'speech. \u25a0 Senator â¢ Knox, "when
he was ; Attorney General, .took the po
sition.'of the 1 leading -man of the Amer-
Ican;bar;and-he has;kept it since. His
speech- caused ..consternation "In. the
ranks of * the" opponents of the; Presi
dent'srate policy, -and they, have been
arguing } it ever s^nce.;^They also have
been ..to stop the stampede;to
the; administration side which 'the
Knox started and "have been
mightily by , the Influence
ofuhe speech of ; President Cassatt and
the; management of the Pennsylvania
Railroad,; who- have been 'arrayed on
the' side of .the Pi'esldent.N;

discu/.slon : of' the "rate "v question ., a year

session. '. In : the message Lwhleh Is' to' be

: POWER. TO FIX SCHEDULES.
. In" his ' message this year â¢ Uie President,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
it Is \u25a0 understood, takes the -position that
this power should. be vested in .the Inter
state , Commerce \u25a0 Commission." or "some
other .power" created by the Federal
Government, and that the ', commlssloa
should have authority to fix a maximum
rateâ that is to say. a, rate above." which
the carriers shall not goâ until -the matter
has been reviewed by the court. But th<3
President still stands out for a law which
would ; put the rate Into effect and keep
it" there, and to all Intents and purposes
his position is the same as last year, be^
cause there would seem to be' no-'Ukeli
hpod of an agreement on some rate-regu
lating body outside of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.*
The message is said to be a very elabo
rate discussion of the whole transporta
tion problem. There are suggestions that
private - car . lines, 'combined j rail and
water .lines, other auxiliary transporta
tion companies,. elevators, etc.^ be brought
\u25a0wlthln'the, control of the Interstate Com- â¢
mere e Commission.
rThe President is not opposed to a Fed
eral ' Inspection of the treat life insurance
companies \u25a0: for the better protection of
the policy-holders. HÂ» believes the wdrlc

CAMPAIGX COXTRIBUTIOXS. *
The message strongly ' denounces the -
corrupt nw of money at elections. The .
President would make It unlawful for \u25a0
nnj ' corporation to contribute to tbe !
funds of a political committee. II â¢
would require the publicity Â»f all cob*
trlhutions of all Individuals. He leave*
Congress no excuse for falllns to meet
this srowlns evil. HH
: There Is'; a full discussion of the,
Panama \u25a0 canal. He describes -the pres
ent financial situation, showing that
the "money 13 exhausted and that more
must; be , appropriated at /once if thÂ» '
workiisinot to halt. .- â¢ .
There! is a recommendation that Con
gress pass ;a- law reducing the tax of
national: bank circulation secured by .
the > proposed Panama I canal bonds. \u25a0so
that they. will be 'available for circula
tion on * the same basis >as the â¢ 2 per

This does, pot "mean that the., plan to

should be sq small as to4eave'the Gov-.
ernment, unless supported by the Irish
party, outnumbered' by .the Tories, Lord
Rosebery' probably would refuse to
head the Cabinet and Sir Henry Camp

which repeats the recent > reports relative to a violent scene In the' Palace.:

peror Mcholas and Grand Duke Vladimir and_ was , relative to Grand Duke,-.
Cyril. . *Th"c '\u25a0 paper adds i "It is certain} that ctonietliins extraordinary oc
curred there beside the disaffection of the guards and that the whole do
mesticwtaff at the Palace is now . prepurinff to strike."
St. Dec. 2.â a. crash
is i ejepeoted moiaen l arlly. i The military
sui'Kcontt, eunoera, technicists and artil
leristM tinve. struck.. The revolution
aries, unwUllntr to give the Government
an excuse for employing violent repres
sion, are .'themselves abstaining frunn
violence, except that discharged w.ork
mcii arc burning- factories.
\u25a0The strike of the postal -and tele
graph employes- is a severe test of the
Government's strength. Russian tele
graph operators are educated men, but
the hardest worked and poorest paid
skilled workers in Europe. . Therefore
they have popular . sympathy in their
present strike. .Minister . Durnovo's
severity in dealing with them is blamed
for the present difficulty, but he has the
law>against organization 'into -unions on
his side, so Premier de Witte must sup
port him
The public,, which/ is â¢ the victim of
the strikes, is responding to an appeal
from Professor. Maartens for volunteers
to take the places of the strikers. Many
persons fear that, this will cause the
strikers to ..change from passive to
armed" ressistance. In any open'bat
tle* with the:Jabor forces : the attitude
6f the army .would be uncertain.- It is
regarded" as that whenever
soldiers or sailors during recent weeks
have presented .petitions reciting griev
ances they have headed the list with a
derriana.for a- constituent > assembly,
which -shows -a broad desire to prac
tically ..change-.the, empire into a re

Early this afternoon, the Great-

Great Northern. Company further
stated that, the quickest means of
reaching thie. Eastern' Finnish coast'
points was by cable to Nystadt and
thence by . letter , to. or
other points.* 'â¢ ' * '.
The Associated' Press is endeavoring
to get into communication witn " the
capital, from, Helstngfors, the nearest
point to St. Petersburg^ but' finds that
route impossible- by wire and there la
some doubt, whether, the water is suf
ficiently free from ice to permit boats
"crossing to. Helslhgfors from , Russian
ports. ' '

English newspapers, \u25a0 have sent* urgent

JURY IS FINALLY SECURED
IV THE GILUOOLEY CASE
Nearly Five Thousand Talesmen Are
Examined Before Twelve Are
Selected by Counsel.
CHICAGO, Dec. 2. â After eight weeks
and the examination of nearly- 4SOO
veniremen a jury was secured to-day, to
try Charles Gilhooley, who is charged
with causing the death of a non-union
workman during a strike. I Gilhooley, it
is said, was the hired "slugger" of the
Carriage Workers' Union and severely
beat a number of non-union men.
There has been great trouble in se
curing the jury because 1 of tho re
luctance of many of the veniremen to
serve and hundreds of them nave de
clared themselves prejudiced against
labor unions to such an extent that
they could not give Gilhooley a fair
trial. The trial will commence on Mon
day next.

Speech.
WASHINGTON; Dec. 2.â The Republi
can members of the Forty-ninth Con
gress met in caucus to-night in the hall
of the House of Representatives and
renomlnated all of the electivp officers
of the House who served during- the
last session. William P.. Hepburn'. was
again chosen chairman of the caucus.
The principal feature of the evening
was the speech of; Joseph* G. Cannon,
who was for a second time unanimous
ly chosen f6r Speaker.;. The nomination
of Cannon and his speech of acceptance
created hearty enthusiasm among the
Republican members, and his remarks
were generally approved.
In accepting the nomination Cannon
said in t>art: ' .- ' i>
/"It would be a bold man or party that
would do anything by legislation or
threat thereof that 'would tend to, de
stroy or check the progress of the peo
ple in the universal and successful
achievement in all branches of industry
in the country. Clothed with full
power, it is our duty to see to it that
by wise appropriations the vast reve
nues gathered from a willing people
are .applied to the public service \to
make the same eflicient, avoiding par
simony on the one hand and extrava
gance on the other.
"Since IS6I, when our party came Into
power, the history of . the Republican
party has been substantially the history
of the country. Our population has more
than doubled and our wealth has been
multiplied by five, (eleven States have
been admitted to the Union, we have to
day almost one-half 'of the world's rail
ways, the product of our labor more
than equals one-third of the product of
the labor of all' the. civilized world; by
invention and enterprise, aided by the
use of our great capital, we have har
nessed tho forces of .nature and made
them- our servants until Individual effort
to-day accomplishes for the benefit of all
the people many times^more than it did
in the early days of the republic. Since
William McKinley took the. oath of of
fice in 1897 the expenditures and reve
nues of the postal service have been
nearly multiplied by two.- This Is the
measure of the industry, production, busi
ness . and commerce of our people.
LAWS TO BE AMENDED. #
','The changes in the methods of pro
duction and commerce, so salutary and
beneficial, Involving 'as they do the ex
traordinary use of combined capital, em
phasizes the necessity for preventing
agreements in restraint of trade and the
regulation of commerce among the States
and with foreign nations. The Congress,
within the limits of its Jurisdiction un
der the constitution, has heretofore en
acted legislation touching these subjects.
In the fullness of time it may be, under
the law as it'now is : and by -the opera
tion* of competitive forces, that matters
of., difference- between' 1 the corporations,
the. carrier and the people they ( ; serve
would be adjusted inj ustice to all.
"tfhe consensus of opinion of the peo
ple/ however, is that. Congress has the
power by -amendment to the law to'pro
vide better remedies for real abuses ex
isting so that the producer and consumer
can find a more speedy and less expensive
remedy^ than we now have. In this'opin
ion I, for one, concur. The burden is
upon Congress and our party, having
power, is primarily responsible. ;
"Let us go forward. ~ But it is our ! duty
to see that legislation is wise in the prem
ises, just to the corporation, the carrier
and to the people. We cannot oppress
one by-foolish or unjust legislation with
out bringing disaster utfon all. We shall
be especially careful to not unduly inter
fere with the operation of the competitive
forces, for after all our very civilization
rests upon it: each individual living in
the sweat of his face is hustling to pro
mote his own interest. We may regulate
commerce among the States and as au
incident thereto we- may regulate "the
competitive force's. -We dare not destroy
them. â¢' ' " * " \u25a0- \u25a0\u25a0 , <;â¢ '
"A word In conclusion.'. Our largema
jority in the House, if we give attention
to will enable us to" do our
work and avoid a long session: I This 'is
certainly desirable. Thc-:responsibillty is
upon ' us. ;\u25a0 From time -to time, in the set
tlement of proper policies and methods
there should be the fullest = consultation
and when necessary we should 'meet in
caucus for conferences and action. Â»â¢

Williams addressed the caucus on mat
ters of policy and the importance of a
virile minority. He si>oke for nearly an
hour and \tgorously repudiated the idea
alleged to have been put torth by Repub
licans that the Democratic party was a
do-nothing party. He referred to the
'long period that the Democratic party
was In power, and declared very emphati
ically that the record of that long trust
compared very favorably with that of
any party in charge, of any Government
at- any time. \u25a0 â¢'. '-i . >, \u25a0
Williams - said that the Democratic
party favored free trade for the Philip
pine Islands. It did not believe that these
islands should be retained by this Gov
ernment, but- it did believe that they
should have all the benefits accruing un
der the American flag as long as that flag
floated over them. ;'. '.
RAIUIOAD KATE LEGISLATION.
Concerning the predominant question of
railroad rate legislation he declared that
such regulation was In accord with the
general Democratic principle of special
privileges to none and equal opportunity
to all. He congratulated the country on
the fact that the President and his fol
loVers had accepted this Democratic idea
ana declared that without the aid of the
President the Democratic party could do
nothing at this time in the way of rate
legislation, while on > the other hand the
President and his followers could do
nothing without the aid of the Demo
crats.
Williams then spoke with great em
phasis about the prevalence of graft in
the Government service, which he said
had lifted its head in the diplomatic
service in Venezuela, in the public land
service, in the postofflce. the. Agricul
tural Department and elsewhere. In
these circjes graft had become worse
than in politics. Graft was the result
of corrupt Ideas, which must necessarily
have a breeding place somewhere, and
Williams declared that "the principle
of protection" was the breeding place.
"It is not a far cry." declared. Wil
liams, "from the position of the man
who thinks the laws should be fixed so
as to put money into his pockets to the
position of the man who wants city
franchises fixed so as to put money Into
his pocket, and it is not a far reach
from those to the insurance director
who, acting as a trustee, controls trust
funds so as to make money out of them
for himself." .
Williams said there were a lot of
temporary Issues to be righted and that
the abiding issue of the tariff will re
main so until it Is settled aright. He
added that the only right way to settle
it was by diverting business from the
Government, as business men seeking
legislation were often a source of po
litical corruption.
Williams ridiculed the idea that there

FILLS HIS HOME

CHICAGO, Dec. 2.â Startling events,
\u25a0which have follov.'ed the mysterious dis
appearance of John A. Thompson, a
wealthy ' but eccentric Swede, have
aroused the village of Hobart, Ind., to a
etate of high excitement. When Marshal

terday went to Thompson's bachelor
housa on the cutskirts of Lake station

dynamite.
A woman named Helen Fritche held a
mortgage on the Thompson house, which
he declined to eatlsfy. Last week she de
termined to foreclose and notified her
agent, Charles Seydel. Seydel met
Thompson in Hobart and told him of
Mrs. Frit che's determination. Thompson
remarked, "Well, there wlH.be a hot wel

than a week Thompson had not been
seen and his house was closed and the
blinds drawn.

"Democrats are conservative," he
continued, ."whenever they- come \u25a0to
conserve things American, equitable,
equal and Just, and they are , radical
whenever they come to tearing' up by
the roots abuses and the exploitation
of the masses by the privileged inter

question to be submitted to them for
their Judgment, but they are never con

to. the enemies of Democracy by dividing
the Democratic forces into two 'parties

LONDON, Dec. 2â Progress is 'lay

fashionable London's most sacred in

at any outdoor function, but anywhere
in the West End of London, with other
than a silk hat and the regulation
dark suit has been considered the
brand of provincialism; now loungd
su,its., soft collars, d,erby hats and brown
boots are worn everywhere. *,
Manufacturers of silk hats are In
despair, -while tailors aver that the
making of frock coats will soon , be

While men's - fashions : are tending 1

NOISE CAUSES
CONSUMPTION
Famous Specialist Says It
-Contributes to H Spread
of the White -Plague
CITFS DIN IS DEADLY
Populace Prone to, Overlook
Effect of High Tension
Upon the Vital Organs
t "
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Dec. 2.â "The noises of a
great city constitute one of the most pro
lific causes of consumption and allied
tubercular diseases," was the statement
of Dr. Archibald Harrington. F. R. C. S.,
and specialist' on lung diseases in' the
University of Glasgow, on the occasion
of his visit to Chicago to-day.
Dr. Harrington, in company with Dr.
Thomas. Orr of the same institution, is
making a tour of America for the pur
pose of examining: hospital conditions.
His high standing in British medical cir
cles and his wide knowledge of the sub
ject lend special Importance to his ut
terances regarding the great white
plague. . r
v "lt is a well-known fact," said Dr.
Harrington, "that city noises have been
a great factor in the production of nerv
ous diseases nnd . the excessively high
tension of modern life. The reflex action
of their effect, on the lungs and other
vital organs has, however, been' over
looked. Noise is a wound in embryo. It
is none the less deadly because It ia a
wound to the finer susceptibilities. Few
people stop to consider the vital effect
that a wound to the nerves causes."

EDUCATOR ATTACKS
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
Says *It Turns Out Ir
responsible Hen and
Women.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
; CHICAGO, Dec. 2.â The pupils turned
out ,by the public schools to-day are un
ttustworthy and unreliable, declare-^ Pro
fessor Wi'bur S. Jackman of the Uni
versity of Chicago to-day in an address
before the Cook County Teachers' Asso
ciation. The educational system of to
day ts- defective the speaker asserted-
He thought that the schools shouM b*
Jible to turn out graduates who could
settle the problems that confront society
as accurately and as confidently ns the
â¢.nechanu lays his plans and builds .1
bridge.
"The teacher permits the pupils to 50
through s-chool and go out without maoh
comment or criticism, but later it 'is
found tt.at there has tjpen turned out en
the markst a rare of people not to !>e
misted and ur reliable," said Professor
Jaekman. "Those people are the product
of had educational methods. Can't we
have an educational system that trains
the pupil the way a mechanic is trained?
Take, for instance, a bridge builder.
When he turns over to the publio a com
pleted bridge, ho can stand back and say:
'I know what that bridge is and that it is
right. 1 The builder can name every part
and tell how it is made and where it came
from. \u25a0 \u25a0
" 'JWhat we want our public schools to
do is to train pupils to seize a situation,
so when they go out into the community
they. can perceive at once what the com
munity, iireds to lift it up and make it
better. Tht teacher should so train the
boys and gJrls that they be turned out
thoroughly reliable men and women."
E)MBASSAI)OR OFEXGI,AXD
,'\u25a0 SXUBS . YANKEES IX PARIS
PARIS, Dec. 2. â Many Americans in
secret, yid some openly, are dissatisfied
with the British Embassador and Lady
Feodorovna Bertie. At their reception
in honor of King Edward's birthday
none was asked except the American
wife of a member of^ the English
Chamber of Commerce. ;
.The British embassy, in the past has
been very hospitable to Americans, and
there is a tendency to resent the ex
cluslveness of an Embassador who U
accused of being spoiled by . personal
friendship with the King. In fact.
Edward is quite attached to him and
gave him the Paris embassy after only
one year of actual diplomatic service.
When the : Kinff was here -he showed
marked preference for the Embassa
dor's society over that of any other
miin.
Their one taste in common is bridge.
Bertie's idea of bliss is popularly sup
posedto be a day in the hunting field
followed by a night at the card table,
and. Lady Feodorovna cordially agrqes.
Their private entertainments are card
parties and play runs high.

DIAMOXDVILLE. Wyo., Dec. 2.-
Eighteen miners lost their liv*?s by an ex
plosion late last night In the Diamond
CoaJ ar.3 Coke Company's mine No. L It
Is bettered that all the men who perished
*ciÂ« instantly killed. What caused the
disaster is not definitely known, but the
theory advanced by the miners is that a
"blown cut shot caused the dust explo
sion, which wrecked, the mine. The shock
of the explosion was felt all over the
town, rocking : buildings so violently that
their occupants ran out into the open.
The news that there had been another
clsaeier at the Diamond mineâ the sec
ond in less than five years â quickly spread
through the village, and practically the
\u25a0Khole population of Diamondville flocked
to the mine shaft. In \u25a0 the \u25a0 previous ex
plosion, which occurred February Â£6, 1901,
thirty-two miners perished.
Wives and children of the entombed
miners were among those who rushed to
the fhaft, and the scenes were most pa
thetic. Though men -were ready to enter
tlie ehaft it was impossible to do so, ow
mg to the after-effect of the explosion,
nrid Superintendent Thomas Sneddon in
sisted that all precautions against fire
should be taken. It was late this fore
noon, before the first rescue party entered
the misie.
The explosion occurred 1100 feet un
der ground and at least SOOO feet from
The mouth of the shaft. The explosion
wrecked the brattices and blocked the
entrances to the lower levels of the
mine, necessitating the removal of
much debris before the miners could be
reached. When the rescuers finally
treat into the mine none could remain
long. The crowds around the mine en
trance eagerly watched as car after car
came up from below, but they brought
\u25a0up only rescuers, who had been over
come by the afterdamp. It was nearly
noon before the first body was
brought iip. ,
The Â£00 coal diggers of the Diamond
mines were assisted in the rescue work
by |nany miners who came over from
' Kem-mt-rer, a few miles distant.
Every man in the mine perished. The
night force is small, their working be
ing limited to knocking down coal to
be taken out by the day shift. Had the
explosion occurred in the daytime the
loss of life would have been far greater.
While the workings are believed to
be not materially damaged, it probably
â¢will be a week before the mine will be
chipping :ts usual output. The Dia
mond Coal and Coke Company is a Salt
Lake concern. The output of the mine
is largely shipped to Salt Lake and the
smelter at Anaconda, Mont.
Many English miners, -who came di
rect to the mines from England, are
â¢â¢mployed at ?->iamond\ ill<=\. and it is be
lieved that a majority of the dead are
Krigiishraen.

BOLD ROBBERS
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN JOSE. Dec. 2.â A revolver duel in
the darkness took place between Detec
tives George Pickering and James Printe
ville and a brace of hold-up men who at
tempted to rob a gang of Japanese work
men returning from the Fox nursery to
night with their wages for the month.
The attempted hold-up took place near
the corner of Seventh and Taylor streets.
The police were warned that an at
tempt at robbery would be made, and the
two detectives were detailed to prevent
it. Thes- arrived in the nick of time, but
the robbers, instead fo submitting to ar
rest, opened fire and a number of shots
were exchanged. In the darkness the
hold-up men made their escape, and it
is not believed that any of the bullets
took effect.
In the past a number of Japanese and
Chinese laborers have been robbed in the
same locality, probably by the men who
were driven away by, the officers to-night.

FRAUDS CALORE
ARE DISCOVERED
Oregon Official Declares
That Eastern Bankers Are
Victims of Bold Swindlers
SEAL OF STATE FOEGrED
Land Agent West Makes Sen
sational Charges in Long
Letter to the Governor
; SALJZM, Dec. 2. â Far, more serious
than any previous development of the
many sided land frauds perpetrated; in
this State are charges made In a let
ter to Governor K. Chamberlain to-day,
from State Land A#ent Oswald West,
who in effect asserts that by means of
forg-ed certificates of the sale. of school
lands, Eastern bankers ' have been
swindled out of untold sums of money.
Xot content, the land agent: asserts,
with havinsr defrauded the State of
approximately 500.000 acres of school
land, practically all it. possessed, by
means of "dummy" entrymen, when
money was no longer to be made in
that' manner, the land operators pre
pared printed certificates, of sale and
assignments and inserted in them de
scriptions of school lands, , on which
certificates had previously been issued,
the number of entry, , then forged the
signature of the clerk of the State Land
Board and notaries public, ', attached
forged notary seals and a forgery ot
the great seal of the State of Oregon
and resold the lands time and again to
innocent persons in the East.
Mr. West says:
"I have discovered a large number
of these forced certificates in the hands
of Kastern bankers and the magnitude
of the frauds will not be known nntll
the, matter is given publicly and the
Kastern holders have sent in their cer
tificates for examination. It is possible
that for every genuine certificate out
standing there may be from two to a
dozen fraudulent ones."
Mr. West concluded by saying that
the forced certificates are bo well exe
cuted that it is difficult to distinguish
them from goocl ones.
"BOOM COUNTY,"
SAYS PARDEE
YREKA, Dec. 2. â A mass meeting of
citizens was held in Peters Hall, to-night.
Representative citizens from all parts of
the county were in attendance. The meet
ing was called in support of a movement
to organize a board of irade. The fol
lowing extract -from a letter of Gover
nor Pardee was read by J. E. McÃride:
. . ."A privately business.. '.advertises its
wares, |a; locality should.tlo < the same.-
To do it. property the locality must depend
upon a public body of some kind like a
board of trade. Siskiyou County has
natural advantages which If properly
brought to the attention of the people
of the country at large will bring to you
many new people and much new capital.
Los Angeles is the Mecca toward which
are turned the eves of the people of the
United States. In fact, most people out
side of California think that Los Angeles
is California. How was this brought
about? Simply by intelligent advertising.
Siskiyou can, if she will, do much for
herself. She has many things to sell.
Let her properly advertise them and she
will surely s reap the reward. By ?.all
means let her get busy."

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
For the fifth time within the last two
years John McCarty, stunted and spare
of flgrure, middle-aged and : sad-faced,
stood accused of having disturbed, > the
peace rby loudly wailing and copiously
ehedding tears in the Third street railway
passenger station. .
"So, you haven't forgotten hex yet?"
Police Judge Mogan asked the little man.
"No. sir; I shall never forget her," was
the reply, delivered in tearfultone.
"It's most extraordinary," rejoined his
Honor, "that you/ retain fond remem
brance of one who treated you so basely.
How much of your time has been spent
In jail since you began mourning her
perfidy?"
"Twenty-two months," was the prompt
answer. "You have given me two sixes,
three threes and one one." ,
"And no sooner have you served each
term of confinement than back to the de
pot you have gone and repeated your
lugubrious offense."
"I have tried to stay away' from the
depot, but I can't do It," despairingly re
sponded the victim of a woman's deceit.
"Well, I'll give you oneâ thirty days,
that isâ this time, and sincerely hope you
will leave the city when you are again at
liberty," Bighed the Judge.
Mr. McCarty was an â¢ industrious shoe
maker when he wooed Miss Gertrude
Mitchell, then employed as waitress in a
Market street restaurant, and when she
blushlngly Informed him that he bad
alienated her affection from a San Jose
hotel clerk, to whom she was affianced,
he popped the question on the" spot and
was falteringly accepted.
The wedding day was set and the
enamored swain, whose - satisfaction at
having won so fair a prize was not les
sened by consideration of her assertion
that she was jilting anotherâ gave to her
all of his savings, amounting to several
hundreds of dollars, and told her to de
vote the brie^ ante-nuptial period to the
renting and equipment of a cozy home
for two. ' . -
About a^'eek prior to thÂ« date desig
nated for the changing qJ her name Miss
Mitchell expressed desire to visit her
parents, J alleged by her to be residing
somewhere In rural Santa Clara County,
and obtain their counsel relative to her
selection of some house furniture!
Charmed by her prudence,^ Mr. McCarty
told her to go at once and < return as soon
as possible, as his minutes would Jbe
hours while she was absent ' from the
cHy,. He escorted her tP the train, ten
derly kissed her adieu in presence of
many people and waved his hat until her
waving handkerchief was no longer visi
ble. - .. ? ..'": ' '\u25a0\u25a0'â¢' \u25a0 "
She never returned to him, nor did he
ever definitely ascertain what became of
her. After. finding her parents he learnad
that she had j not visked them, and at
San Jose he discovered that : a ; certain
hotel clerk" disappeared from nhat -town
.about 'the time Miss Mitchell disappeared
Ifrom San Francisco. Then the little man
came bacik a n 4 ?P^nt his days and nights
dejectedly ; hauntirig,the spot. wher"e he
had last parted "from her.' As she had
taken all his money and he was too mis
erable to earn more he quickly- descended
to vagrancy. Repeated : warnings : to
"move oh" he ignored.' The remainder
of the story has been' told," /'
"I'm sufferin* . wld, consumption,"
pleaded Walter Lambert/ who was ar
rested while soliciting alms from per-
Bons leaving the Grand Opera-hous.e.
The -claim 'was not â¢ belied by his

Fred I C Anderson; ,an itinerant vender
of automatic toys. OreallyiJ owe J ,:Judga
Mpgan's dismissal ;of the- charge;; \u25a0 of
sidewalk obstructing on which he was
arrested by Patrolman* - Driscoll â¢\u25a0 at
Market and O'Farrell streets. The ac
cusation was pretty thoroughly proved,
but such difficulty did the court officers
experience In holding converse with
the defendant, despite the fact that
they yelled into one of his ears through
v bell-shaped trumpet suspended from
his neck, that the Judge despairingly
cast out the case. ...
The testimony went to show that Mr.
Anderson, who la short ' and . fragile of
frame, was exhibiting* two Bayly attired
dancing dolls on the sidewalk, thereby at
tracting and retaining a great crowd of
people, when a large dog that. was pass
ing with his owner caught a glimpse of
the pirouetting manikins and, probably
imagining they * were some new species
of rat or cat, fiercely dashed upon them,
upsetting many spectators that barred
his path, and after seizing one of them
between his massive jaws crunched It
until its Internal' mechanism was .wrecked.
â¢ In effort to save his property from de
molition" Mr. Anderson detached his ear
trumpet, the only weapon to him avail
able, and battered the dog. whereupon
the owner of the animal undertook to
batter Mr. Anderson. Thus the situation
existed when the policeman intervened.
â¢ Mr. Anderson, with voice at the lofty
pitch usually employed by deaf folk, de
manded to know in court why the dog
was not arrested for malicious destruc
tion of property, and It was the Indi
vidual and* collective endeavor^ of the,
prosecuting-" attorney; ; ttfe clerk "and -two
bailiffs to explain to him, via the trumpet,
the law relating* to canine responsibility
that created the din that bewildered the
bench and' provoked the order of dis
missal. But even then Mr." Anderson
would not' cease to trouble. He demand
ed that the tfog's owner be arrested and
the dog. Itself Impounded "and held as
hostage for damages, and he was still
shouting when Bailiff Mahoney, hoarse
from trumpeting, hustled him. to the cor
ridor. â¢

rest for neglecting to. equip hia auto

damaging both vehicles. He was not
arrested for the collision, but Judge

; A sad case of a woman's suffering
and a man's brutality was disclosed to
the Board of Insanty Commissioners
yesterday, afternoon when the. members
committed Mrs. Elizabeth Richardson
to the State Asylum at "Napa. From
the evidence Introduced It was shown
that* the woman's pitiful condition was
brought about by her husband's harsh
treatment.
The woman had been before the In
sanity Commissioners on two* previous
occasions. Some time ago she was
found wandering about the streets by
Patrolman Jenkins. On the previous
night her husband, J. G. Richardson,
had climbed Into her room In an Intoxi
cated condition and frightened her so
badly she lost' her reason. Relatives
sent "her away, thinking the change
would benefit her, but the unfortunate
woman's j reason seemed to- have de
serted her and ; the Insane asylum is
her last refuge. .

NEW PRESIDENT
DEFINES POLICY
Will Work to Bring in Jnvfestors
in Mines ..of ( California. I
The, policy- of . the new president .of
the California Miners' Association.
Alf Tregidgo, as he expreses- it,, is to
attract investors ,to this State." What
Mr. Tregidgo has; to say in his repre
sentative capacity, will be interesting at
this time. In part, he expresses his in
tentions as follows: J:V/.\
Times change' and men . must "" change with
them or get left in the procession of progress.
New methods are now to the front. ' We must
adopt them. The new process replaces the
hydraulic method and enable* us to work these
great deposits on a far more economical basis
than when we used to waste the water. We
utilise the water now and get all that is in it.
In New York last year there was distributed
in dividends 5160, 060. 000. All that money is
for speculative purposes and no one can tell
mÂ« that it wiil not come this way, where tnÂ«
sold is known to be locked up in the earth,
but easily available to capital. Then, too,
the balance of trade is in favor of the United
States and we have all kinds of money In our
financial centers, every dollar of which is look
ine for investment. â¢ â¢
As president of the" Miners" Association it
will be my policy to seek to develop great prop
erties and to attract to- the mining industry
of this State a great share of this money that
only needs to be told where it can be Invested
ior it to com* to us.
Professor Hilgard of the University
of California, writing to the California
Miners' Association,' expresses, the view
that the fine ' materials comprehended
under the term of mining slickens are
not wholly different in kind fVom the
natural wash of the mountain torrents,
such as always must be. brought. down
by the torrents. In his opinioo the
slickens ! may be made a benefit If
properly distributed over the agricul
tural valley lands. .Concerning 'this
matter, which will be discussed more or
ffess, it may be well to give the exact
words of Professor Hilgard, which are,
in part, as. follows:
To this view I fully agree> it being evident
from the rapid and vigorous growth of treea
and chaparral on the debris within the placer
and hydraulic mines themselves, that the finer
material Is well adapted to vegetable growth,
even though lacking In humut content. It is
the excessive amounts deposited over llmitea
areas and sorted into beds of sand of Â»everal
reet here and sheets of fine. Impervious slick
ens there that are&phiefly objectionable.
Of course, the same things happen where
there are no hydraulic mines or debris,
wherever streams Inundate agricultural lands;
and it is not easy to define the exact In
crease caused by these mining operations,
aside from the gravel masses clearly originat
ing, there. If the fine debris could be so con
trolled that only a relatively thin layer would
be deposited each flood season; to be plowed
in:- or if they could be deposited on the peaty
tule lands, they would be a material benefit
to agriculture, as alluvial deposits are all over
the world.
But a proper distribution of these materials
means control of the flood waters of the ; rivers,
an Improvement now called for so urgently
by bo many interests that enormous sums
have been set aside by the United States
Government for the selection and establish
ment of reservoirs .wherever Possible, to serve
for irrigation as well as for the development
of the water power now so urgently needed
in the numerous industries connected with
riectric power, including therein the working
of the mines themselves.
Speaking from his viewpoint. Profes
sor Hilgard also says that "It cannot
be too strongly urged. that instead, of
being antagonistic, the agricultural and
mining Industries are vitally concerned
in each other's welfare. The suppres
sion of the development of the foothill
and rnpurftaitf. reg*dss ofÂ£the State is
injurious to the welfare; and progress
of the whole, *both country and cities,
and all good citizens ought to work
for the establishment of a broad policy
for the benefit of all."
1 IMPOUTANT MINE. TOPICS.
For general information some of the
more important matters considered by
the California Miners' Association at
its recent convention at Nevada City
are summed up herewith:- â¢ ;
Because the Debris Commission was
unable to protect miners, as the con
vention declared "against those who
without giving bonds .'are able. to se
cure injunctions in the f local courts,
shutting down the mines for indefinite
periods, it was resolved that the Presi
dent-of the United States be urged to
recommend to Congress that it take
such action as shall extend the scope of
the reclamation service of the United
States Geological Survey so that it
Bhall be confined no longer merely to
the storage of flood waters and to the
irrigation of arid lands, but that it may
also include the reclamation of swamp
and overflowed lands by the deposition
of sediment upon them from sediment
bearing streams in such manner as -to
reclaim them for the purposes of agri
culture and enable the resumption,
without injury to others, of that great
industry of hydraulic mining, to which
California owes so much, under condi
tions similar to those in force for the
reclamation of arid lands, ,and .that a
copy of these resolutions be forwarded
\u25a0â¢Â» the President of the United States "
'v \ topographical State map was ad
ocated; resolutions were adopted to
â¢ive' the waters on. the deserts pro
ected against pollution, and it was also
resolved to ask the Geological Survey
co lend its aid that wells may be sunk
on the deserts; the creation of a Secre
tary of Mines and Mining was advo
cated The text of the resolutions re
garding the. punishment, of any who
may attempt to . blackmail hydraulic
miners is as follows:
Wherea*. Hon. Robert T. Devlin. United
States District Attorney for the northern dis
trict of California, ha* reported to the Cali
fornia Debris Commission that no Federal
statute now exists for the prosecution or pun
?shm-nt of parties offering or accepting brlbei
in relation to the conduct of hydraulic mining;
be it
Resolved. That Senators and Representatives
In Congress of the State of California be re
sDectfully requested to urge the passage of a
Federal statute for the , prevention and pun
ishment of the giving, receiving, offering or
demanding , anything of j value for permission
to mine or Drevention from mlninsr .by the
hydraulic or other process of . any mining
ground whatever.; 1 ;
FIXD ORES IN .TRINITY.
A discovery of ore has been'niadeMn
the mining properties recently bought
by John and James Treadwell in Trin
ity County, -which leads the Redding
Searchlight to assert that "they have
the richest, and largest gold mine ever
discovered In -California"; â¢ also, that
"mining men." their .names ; not being
mentioned. ; "say. that this opens, up a
new era in mining in Northern Califor r
nia." The : claims lie six miles north
east of Trinity Center.
- According, to: the "Nevada .City Miner
Transcript â¢* the \u25a0 development along the
blue p lead ancient ;.river channels 'in
Nevada County \u25a0 is ; attracti ng ' attention.
The Journal*tnat has been mentioned

From 1865 \u25a0to 1875 there were strung . along
the channel from Hunts Hill to Little York no
ness than eighteen cement mills of. a .capacity
of eight etamos each, all being \u25a0 profitably , em
ployed in ' crushing the â¢ bedrock , cements ,: con
tained in the old channel.
â¢ These mills were running . side by . s|de with
the hydraulic 1 motor en ground where^he fall
was too slight - for - the latter process, or burled
\u25a0o deep that only drifting. was possible. â¢
'The estimated product of these mills on a
stretch of flve.mlleÂ» of the old. river was, for
the 'ten v years'' they were \u25a0 employed, '\u25a0 about
$5,000,000,^ this , being â¢ Independent of , the re

Evans and Fitzgerald claim. . has re
sumed operations; 'The same paper
says 'of the Markley mine:
This mine was started up some three month*
e-go by parties from Sari Irranclsco. They buJlt
a mill and proceeded -to run . through tha , rock'
tbat had accumulated on < the dump from pru
vlous operations. This was merely to ascertain
If the rock was of paying grade to Justify fur
ther operations/They were working under an
option to purchase, and the real ownerÂ» potted
the- notices to protect the property against
liens. -Work \u25a0. was suspended j after running
through the dump and the operators leÂ£t, say
ing they would return the fore part of this
month. They had not returned-py the begin
ning of this week. It is probable that the ore
did not come up to anticipations, and that the
mine has lapsed Into inactivity for an indefinite
period. , The mine .la northeast of * Volcano.
The Sonera Union ' Democrat pub
lishes the following:
Negotiations are under way for the Fair
Oaks, oa which the mill was hung up on the
4th of this month,, but will probably resume
crushing ; within the next two or three weeks.
According to many assays the ore In the mine
was of good grade throughout, but thus far the
mill has been unable to save but a fraction of
the sold. Fifty pcr 1 cent of assay returns would
mean healthy dividends, and the aim of thÂ»
owners now Is to find a process that will moke
good. The fault may be in the mill or those
operating it, and it may be that the ore is 'of
such character as to preclude treating by ordi
nary methods. It Is said that dissipation fol
lows partial amalgamation and that to over
come this cyaniding may eventually be re
sorted to.

at 736% Green street was recalled In
Judge Dunne's court yesterday In the
case of Sam Possafume. who appealed
against his conviction and sentence of

t of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson
and other American patriots cf-Revolu
tionary times, whxh, is to be sold at i
Sotheby's this weft
These letters, Tttich are beisgr disposed
i j cf by the present: Marquis of Lafayette.
, were "addressed to his famous ' ancestor j
; and other members of " the Lafayette j
1 family between the years of 1722 and 1524. j
Perhaps the most important, from a his
torical standpoint. â¢"! Is one by George
Washington, which Ideals with *he rela
tionship between * the United States,
! France -and "Great : Britain:, discusses the j
â¢ possibilitr of a French invasion, and de- <
i dares its author prepared to "gird on i
\u25a0 the sword again." This letter is dated j
j from Mount Vernon. December 25, 1735, J
â¢ and is written on eleven pages quarto, j
I In it Washingtcn complains- of the exist- j
j ence in the United Suites cf a party whb |
I "oppose the Government la all its meaa- )
lures, and are determined (as all their i
conduct evlncfc*). by clogging its wheels. I
indirectly to change the nature of it and j
to subvert the constitution."
And again:
- "Xo one during the whole of my ad
i ministration labored- more incessantly
i and with, more sincerity and zeal than j
I 1 did to avoid this and to "render- every j
i Justice, nay favor, to France consist- f
i ent with the neutrality which has been j
[ proclaimed toÂ»the world. But neutral- j
i ity w,as not the. point at which .France
| was aiming, for while it was crying
' 'Peace, pe.ace,,\ and pretending- that they .
': did not wish' us to be embroiled .in
j their quarrels with Great Britain, the^'
: were" pursuiÃg measures in this coun
itrr Â»o repugnaatto its sovereignty and
j so incompatible with 'every prlnciple-of
i neutrality as must inevitably have pro
i duced a war with % the" latter." \u25a0*
In another passage, still referring to
ithe' opposition party in the United
j States, Wasijin&ton goes on. to r ?aj* that
L"if the, Frenchjjshould attempt to In
| vade this -country we ourselves would
j be among- the foremost .to ;Tepel the at- \u25a0

The several letters by Thomas' * Jef
ferson' In eluded in. this collection are
by no means "polite," .for in" them! Jef
ferson gives full ve,nt to.hls dislike ;.df
England .and the English. In-. one of.
these communications, written In-1792.
he says to Lafayette:
â¢"Behold you then, my dear, friend, at
the head of a great army, /establishing
the liberties cf your, gwn country against
a foreign enemy, may heaven favor your
cause, and make you the cbapnel through
which It may pour its favors- While you
are exterminating the monster aristocra
cy and pulling out the teeth^and fangs of^
its associate.m onarchy, a* contrary ten
dency Is discovered here.\ v * â¢'â¢ Agita
tors "which have. be*n hatched in a bed of
corruption made" up alter ;the* model of
their Bfeloved England.*? : N '-** *'..\u25a0/
In a .letter, to Mme.t- Lafayette, dated
DecemberrS; ISIS, he speaks of England^,
rulers:
"Yet by such worthless beings is a
great nation to be governed and even
made to;defy their old ' King because he-Is'
only a fool and a maniac, and to forgive
and to forget his having lost to them, a
great and flourishing empire, added 900
millions sterling to their debt, for which
the fee simple of the whole islarfd would
not sell, if offered - farm by . farm at a
public auction, .and Increased their annual
taxes from 8 to TO millions, more than the
whole rent roll of the island." â¢ ,
In : another -tetter dated a year- earlier
he says: \u25a0â¢ \u25a0
"I believe the loss of the battle of
Waterloo was', the . salvation .of France.
Had Bonaparte obtained the victory, his
talents, his egotism and destitution of till
moral principle, would have riveted a
military despotism on your necks."

ANN ARBOR. Mich., Dec 2:â Restored
frcm seeming hopeless lunacy to complete
sanity yesterday by a surgical operation
at the university hospital, William Dwyer
In a momentary period of control after

j begged the surgeon to kill him If it ap
i pear*d that he would always have to-be
j crazy.
j Two years ago In a smelter furnace at
j Portland, Ohio. Dwyer's skull was
crushed by a steel rail. After an appar
ent recovery he became a month ago a
raving maniac. In the operation it was
demonstrated that his mental trouble
was entirely- due to an abscess "on his
brain. This was successfully removed
and a sliver plate about " two inches
ftjnare fitted in the hole that the surgeon
bad- made In the skull. Then) the scalp
â¢was sewed In place and the patient is
well on the way. back to his former* use

With the orchestra shoved under the

back walls Mansfield and "Dr. Jekyll and
Mr ' Hyde" broke the record at the Grand
Opera-house last nisht. It was a finale
worthy of the season, altogether pht
ndmenally successful. And it was the
only performance of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde." There is not a small proportion
of theater-tvers to whom Mansfield spells
Just "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." With

the rest not to "do" Mansfield in the yel
low drama is not to "do" the Tower when
one goes to London.' Therefore the or
chestra trumming away In the basement
and the immense standing .population.
Last night's version of the play was
particularly well acted and exceptionally
wtll staged. And there was not a light
that failed. â¢ Indeed, the lightning was
perhaps overzealous. StlH, one knows so
Httle here of the ways of lightningâ yet,
it do stem odd when it cuts clean through
the walls.
But the green light was never greener,
and the way' the house sunk >radvally
into Cimmerian shadows at Hyde's com
lngs-on was no end thrilling.
Mansfield hates the part. Of .this one
is well assured. 1 Yet it is tremendously
clever stuff- of-its sort; the people want
It: and what would you?
i Perhaps his Jekyll last night was more
Ingenuous, more youthful, than In earlier
years; the Hyde was the same ghastly,
unique norror. and Mr. Mansfield was
powerfully assisted in some of his scenes
by his company. Notably here comes
Miss Alma .Hathawav. who, as Hyde's
landlady, added a distinctly new and dis
tinctly thrilllnc element. Mr. Andrews
also as Dr. Tanyon was highly effective,
THE SAN > FRANCISeO;-,e^LL.,- SUNDAY, DECEMBER .3. ,1905/
and Fuller Mellish's ' sleuth was as good
as his Gratiano was badâ than which no
more in. praise '. can be saidâ without one
were to say it was as good of its kind
as his excellent King Philip ("Don Car
los"). Henry Wenman , and Miss Irene
Prahar both helped things, along. Alto
gether the performance was good and the
applause throughout" heavy".
' At the matinee, when - the real Mans
iieldians took leave, of Mansfield, the'or
chestra, playing the dreaming old French
things that go with, the. piece by. the
grace of the actor-manager, was not un
der the stage. Yet 'the -theater was also
crowded for this second giving of "The
Misanthrope," the particular, jewel of the
season, and for a performance of the
play that bettered 'in ' many \u25a0 points; the
first. For nothing ..that the actor has
given us during these last two weeks will
he be more gratefully â¢ remembered than
for his admirable production.'.; of "The
Misanthrope." Yet there is his noble
"Don Carlos" of the list: "The Merchant
of Venice," with its marvelous Shylcck;
the . magnificent ;, production of "King
Richard III," with the new and brilliant
reading of the name role, the perennially
exquisite "Beau Brummel" and' "A
Parisian . Romance.". :. That . the ' public
response has beenf as-generqus and ap
preciative as the Mansfield offering was
worthy is notably true. Mr. Mansfield
has given his bestâ so. have the people.

SEEKS TO AID
EX-PRISONERS
Dr. Lynd Calls Attention
to Eflforts of AsBociatiqh
That Helps' the Fallen
IS STKONGLY INDORSED
Men Well KmVon Through
out the State Members of
the Board of Directors
.The California Prison Association;
composed of representative men. ;hav
ing at heart the Interest of the city and
commonwealth, is seeking the co
operation of the general public, Jn ; Its
campaign , for the prevention of crime
and the care of discharged prisoners.
'Vyro and a half is the daily average
of prisoners discharged the year round
from the two State prisons.';. The asso
ciation, lays stress upon the fact these
ex-prisoners must go somewhere and
live some way and unles they are
cared for they will almost naturally
drift back into "crime, even to gain- the
necessaries of life. : f
! ..:- The Rev. Samuel E. Lynd, Ph. D., su
perintendent of the association and
whose residence Is at 2023 ; Channlng
I way, Berkeley, speaking of the efforts
being made by his organization, says,
"It costs at the lowest average $1000
to prosecute a criminal under a jury
trial. For less than one-twentieth- of
this sum our association can secure and
keep a worthy- ex-prisoner employed
for five yearsâ that, is we can find em
ployment for each man for $10 a year.
With a sufficient number of contribu
tions of that amount we can * estab
lish a home. of industry, to which the
ex-prisoner may. come immediately on
( his discharge from prison and be kept
busy until more permanent employment
can be secured for him. \u25a0
UOEUALLY INDORSED.
"We have been liberally indorsed by
the Charities Indorsement Committee of
San Francisco, Chamber of Commerce
of Sacramento and many other organi
zations interested in the prevention of
crime and the protection of our busi
ness interests. . :
"At this time of the year it is much
more difficult to secure work than at
any 'other- period, hence the ' need of
speedy and generous co-operation :-\u25a0 in
caring for these men who come out of
prison with only $5 and a suit of
clothes, which is quickly recognized by
former companions and many, others
who know. the prison conditions. . -.
"It must be awful to 'serve time, 1 but
the real punishment and humiliation
begin when the,, man comes out and
tries to earn a living.
"It must not be overlooked that, all
prisoners are not really criminals.
Many are more weak than mean, more
sinned against than sinning. Under
proper, influence nearly 75 per /cent
could be restored to a better manhood,
j PROMIXENT MEX INTERESTED.
. "Our association stands for law. wisely
enacted and rigorously enforced. - j for
punishment for violation of Jaw, ;, but
humanely applied, for prisons- not^ a3
training schools for making criminals,
but as industrial reformatories to make
men, from .which a man may come bet

PRISON DIRECTORS RESUME
SAN QUENTIN INQUIRY.
Warden Makes New Insinuations Against
Officials Serving Under Him.
Warden J. W. Tompkins, head of San
Quentin prison, whose official conduct is
now undergoing a thorough investigation
by the Sfate Board of Prison Directors,
talked freely again yesterday about his
case anil had a new charge to make, ac
cusing by innuendo the officials under him.
but offering no direct facts against them.
He stated that his desk" had been ran
sacked to get evidence against him, and
that he had recently found a place in his
letter book where copies of letters he had
written had been cut out and made away
\u25a0with. He said his house was being
â¢watched to find out those of the convicts
who may be in his favor, and expressed
anger at this. He seemed unable to
fasten anything upon any individual cr
group of men, but insinuated that certain
officers of the prison were guilty.
The Prison Directors met again yester
day at San Quentin and took evidence j
In the case, going deep into every depart
ment of the prison. The question which
laces the board is one between subor
dinate officers and Warden. It does not <
teem'that Warden Tompkins and some of i
the men under him can get along to- |
gelher, an<l it will probably be either him
er they who will be a^ked to go when
the board renders its final decision.
At the present time the matter is in the
Blr. It is probably true that not one
member of the board has made up his
mind what the solution of the problem
â¢will be. They arc taking testimony from
every possible soarre so as to tind where
the most blame lies. They examine the
efnÂ« rs secretly and let them talk as they
please, assuring them that their words
mill not go beyond the walls of the room
lti which the investigators are Hitting.
Consequently" each officer is telling of his
troubles with the Warden as freely as
though he were talking within the bosom
of his family.
Warden Tompkins will be given his
chance before the board next Saturday.
At that time he will have a full opportu
nity to give his side of the case. It is to
he, the pr>licy of the board to give Warden
Tompkins the benefit of every doubt that
arises. At the end of next Saturday's
session the directors will probably an
nounce the result of their investigations.
Whichever side. Warden or officers, wins
11 teems probable that some one will be
dropped from the payroll of the prison.
Harmony can never be established be
tween Tompkins and certain of the of
ficers, it is Bald.
Clerk J. M. Oliver denies that he has
any aspirations to become Warden should
Tompkins be dismissed. He says that he
X Intends to give up his present position
home time next year. U -1
At yesterday's session President K. F.
Devlin was not present. Warden Tomp
kins was not Questioned, although he ap
peared before the board for a moment.
JCo other business was transacted.
RELEASED FROM DARK HOLE.
MuvldanM Sent to Dungeon Because
They Objcc<rd to Spjr liberated.
SAX QUENTIN, Dec. 2.â After War
den Tompkins had held his daily court
martial inside the prison walls on the
alleged violators ot prison rules and
disposed of the cases he ordered nine
prisoners released from the incorrigible
cells, where they have been in solitary
confinement, some for a few days., while
others had been confined for weeks.
.Among tne prominent convicts released
xvas Bandmaster Mitchell of the late
prison convict band and several mem
bers, who objected to a convict de
tective occupying their quarters, thus
forcing one of their members out.
They occupied the red room, a large
room containing Bleeping quarters for
thirty or forty convicts, principally
members of the band. After they were
locked up, about 5 in the afternoon,
they would put in their time In band
practice.
When the Warden tried to foist the
convict detective' upon them a couple
of months ago Mitchell and several
others objected strongly to his pres
ence and his supplanting a member of
the band In the room. It resulted in
l the band breaking up and Mitchell and
Vv-Uers going to the incorrigible cells.
release to-day was a surprise to
lijom and the Warden in releasing them
eaid that upon further investigation^Jie
had concluded that their Infractions of
'the rules were not as bad as he' had
believed.
The band was organized several years
ago tor thÂ» purpose of diverting tbe

NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â Joseph M.
Deuel. Judge of â¢ the Special Sessions
Court, part owner of Town Topics and
interested in its subsidiary publica
tion, "Fads and Fancies,". walked into
Magistrate Whitman's chambers in the
Tombs Court to-day just in time to
hear read a letter from Colonel Mann,
editor and publisher of Town Topics,
in which many rich.; men who were
wanted as subscribers to "Fads and
Fancies" at $1500 each were described
as "very rich," and pompous and "vain,'
and. of others', that they "ought to bt,
good victims."
Judge Deuel did not seem to be en
tirely at ease us he listened to some
of the evidence brought out by James
V. Osborne in his cross-examination
of Colonel. Mann, who accuses Peter F.
Collier. and his son, Robert, proprietors,
ot Collier's Weekly, and Norman Hap
good, its editorial writer, of having
libeled him criminally. . He heard Os
borne's declaration that Judge Deuel
himself was an agent of Colonel Mann
in alleged blackmailing schemes.
So quietly did Judge Deuel leave the
room that few persons noticed his exit.
His face was pale. \u25a0 ;
MAX.\'S 'LETTER TO'WOOSTEH.
Colonel Mann had a most disagree
able hour of it. He was clearly sur
prised to learn that Osborne had his
letters and those of Judge Deuel. a:id
so were many others. Most of the let
ters had been written "to "Mos>es" Ellis
Wooster. .-j. f } '\u25a0}-'â¢
Colonel Mann was not at all pleased
when Osbocne, referring â¢to his talk
ativeness, said, he wished to get 'at the
facts "on which it may be ' necessary
to formulate a"h - indidtrrient," nor' did
lie join in'thc general, laugh which fol
lowed Osborne's" remark at one stage:
"Everybody works but father; every
body works but the old Mann."'
The principal letter introduced was
dictated by Colonel Mann to his stenog
rapher, was written by her on* Town
Topics note paper and was addressed
to Wooster. . It was about men ; who
might be induced to subscribe for
"Fads and Fancies" and was as fol
lows:
"I do not pretend to know the situa
tion in reference to any of the follow
ing names, but if you hit them in the
right way you might get a few of
them. Here is the list: . . ..\u25a0.;\u25a0'\u25a0

this city is rich and vain. If you can
discover ..any: way on earth to get two
minutes with Frederick C..- Bourne, who,
I think, is now "commodore of the New

Judge Deuel's letter to Wooster, also
on trie letterhead of Town Topics, in part
read: :"H^.'-^: "H^.'-^ ' > :
"Your letter of the 19th, withinclosures

said in a letter: .
"General Fitzgerald is a very pompous

MIDDIES AND CADETS
PLAY EXCITING GAME
Football Representatives of Annapolis and qf
West Point Each Score Six Points. ,
PRINCETON, N. J.. Dec. 2.â Army 6,
navy 6. . . ..'->
While the army-navy football game
to-day was probably one of the most ex
citing ever played between the two in
stitutions, it was simply a side show
to the social football event of the sea
eon. Twenty-five thousand people saw
the same. From all sections of the
United States carae spectators who crdi
,iarily would not travel a score of mlle3
to s*e a football contest. All this was
doubtless brought about by the fact that
President Roosevelt was to be present.
Seated in the tast and west stands were
the genuine football enthusiasts. Every
play made by their respective teams was
eagerly watched. There were uproarious
cheers fur the Quick, dashing runs and
sighs for the attempts which failed- But
tho dashing runs were few. Once Tor
ney got away for a pretty run of thirty
sii. which brought the army sup
port* rs to ttieir feet. Decker on one oc
casion tJectrificd the navy rooters by
almost getting away from the army elev
en. Only the slippery condition of the
Held prevented Decker from doing some
remarkable work. He frequently got be
yond the line, but as he turned to circle
lhe end the treacherous turf played an
important part of the army, and Decker
was pounced upon before he could ro-
Sain a foothold.
CADETS SCORE TOUCHDOWN.
Near the close of the lirst half the
army got the ball on the navy's thirty-
Cvc-yard line on an exchange of kicks.
Howard, who kicked brilliantly for An
napolis, sent the spiral high in the air.
The easterly wind carried the ball back
ward toward the navy goal, so that in
distance it had traveled not more than
Tsve yards. From this point the West
Pointers carried the ball over for & touch
down. Weeks, Smith, llili, Christie and
Torney carrying the ball.
A West Point player was responsible
.for the' tie game. On an exchange of
kicks within ten minutes of the close of
the game the navy had the ball near
midSeld. Howard sent a beautiful punt
fcack of the West Point goal. As the
navy eleven started down the field an
army man . was dejected by Umpire
-Wrcjin holding one of the navy. As a
penalty; the ball was brought back and
feiven to the navy on the army's thirty
yard line. In a last desperate effort the
Annapolis boys placed the ball on West
Point's fifteen-yard line. lost it.
but the army was forced to kick again,
and the navy got the ball on the army's
forty-yard line- and carried it back twen
ty yards. Here they kicked and Johnson
fumbled. An Annapolis boy was on the
pipskin in a flash. At this point Douglas
was sent in at left halfback and Smith
Â»t fullback for Annapolis. The change
had a bracing effect on the navy eleven.
With renewed fierceness and a determina
tion that would net be? denied, they car
ried the ball over for a. touchdown. Nor
ton,' who had replaced Decker, kicked
the goal.
DARKNESS SETTLES DOWN.
It was so dark that only the players
and the referee could see where the ball
had gone between the posts. When the

So powerful is the virus of Contagious Blood Poison that it will disease the. entire
blood supply of the strongest, healthiest person, and the. hideous symptoms which follow de-
grade and pollute the body from head to foot. Unless the poison is driven from the blpod : 'it
preys on the internal members and tissues and eats but the very; life of those so. unfortunate
as to contract the vile disorder. *. \u25a0** \u25a0r. \ r \u25a0 .'
Contagious Blood Poison is the most treacherous of all diseases; It has its victims in
its grasp almost before they realize the blood" is diseased; ; because its first symptom,
which is a little sore or ulcer, is so insignificant that it^does not usually excite suspicion:
When this virus is in the blood the mouth and throat ulcerate, copper colored spots
appear, a red rash breaks out, the hair comes out, the glands in the groin swell, and
ulcerating sores often form on the limbs, hands or face. But this is not all; if the poison is
allowed to remain it works down and affects the bones, causing necrosis or decay, attacks the
nerves, and causes tumors to form on thefbrain, and insanity or death is the result.

It will not do to tamper with a disease that is so powerful as Contagious Blood Poison,
for every day it remains in the blood it is progressing toward a dangerous stage and may
in the end get beyond the reach of any treatment. Mercury and Potash 'are of ten given
to cure the trouble, but cannot conquer the mighty poison.' 'These minerals may, for: a while,
drive the symptoms away and shut the disease up iii the; system, but when the treatment
is left off the trouble returns and makes more rapid headway because of the ''disastrous'
effects of these strong medicines on the system. The continued use of Mercury and Potash
destroys the delicate lining of the stomach, causing chronic Dyspepsia,; and ; so injuriously
affects the bowels that the patient is often 1 left a physical wreck. ; \u0084

dozen policemen, walked briskly from the
grounds. The demonstration accorded the
President when he entered the field, and
also the thunderous cheer* which greeted
him between the halves as he left his seat
in the navy stand and walked acfoss the
gridiron to the army stand, were infinite
ly more hearty and spontaneous than
those accorded the combined elevens of
the two branches of. the fighting depart

The President was apparently gratified
with the hearty reception. From the
time he entered the grounds at the south
west corner of Osborne field until he
reached the box In the navy's section the
cheering was continuous, and he received
a similar greeting as he crossed to the
east stand. - - .-
PRESIDENT'S ENJOYABLE DAY.
President Roosevelt's day In Princeton
was an enjoyable one. From the moment
he stepped from his train until he de
parted for the capital he was cheered by
the football 'spectators. The President's
train arrived at the little Princeton sta
tion at 12:22 p. m., and was warmly
greeted by the 2000- persons who had as
sembled on the edge of the campus. The
President and Mrs. Roosevelt were wel
comed by President Woodrow Wilson,
and after the greetings the party entered
carriages and started for the home of Dr.
Wilson. Four mounted guards sur
rounded the /carriage in which were the
President Mtd Mrs. Roosevelt, Secretary
Root and â¢r. Wilson. In the carriages
following were Mr. and Mrs. Cowles an v
Secretary Loeb. The party remained at
President Wilson's house until 2 p. m..
Secretary Taft, Assistant Secretary

Ethel Roosevelt and other members of
the party on the President's Special had
luncheon on the train. â¢
After the President left the football
field he entered the clubhouse of the

''-Ladies' Plate" and for the consolation
scramble were as close and as exciting
as could.be seen on any track.
The field for 'the "Ladies' Plate," the
feature of thq card, contained the ; high
est class 'ponies ever saddled' for an
association event. Among them was
Ulctma, a grandaughter of "the once
king-.: of the turf, Salvator; Midlove, a
daughter of Midlothian, and Leah, by
the Kentucky thoroughbred, Elkins.
The old rivals, Ulctma and Midlove,
were the class of the race and went
quickly to tne front after the start, the
blaze face of Midlove slightly In the
lead. R. M. Tobinkept her there un
til Just \u25a0 before wire was reached,
when J. C. Hayes Jr. brought UlQtma up
under vigorously urging and won by a
short head. Bas Blancs came, from
away back after getting the worst of
the start and finished third.
The winner was nominated' by Mrs.
Rudolph' Spreckels and was cleverly
handled by Mr. Hayes, the Southern
California sportsman. Mldlove, : which
ran in the name of Mrs. C. Raoul-Duval,
was ridden by Mr. Tobin.
W. W. Ashe, a promising young
horseman, S was the last to . finish and
received an alarm clock as a prize.
.Walter 'Hobert' wound it up arid- the
â¢rider- went down : the- track to the pad
dock with the alarm sounding merrily.
The trophy was decorated with the
association's colors. . \u25a0 '
The spectacular race of the day- was
the consolation scramble at one-quarter
of a mile, for which three started. Cap
tain McKlttrick's gray rriare, Helen War
wick," looked all over' a winner for -a
time. Frank Skinner then brought up
Hopeful after she ran .out with him on
the turn. .While these two were lighting
it out Bas Blarics came with an electrify
ing burst'' oil speed in the last hundred
yards and won cleverly..
Honoma turned the tables on Ethel G
In the mile event. Young Marsh again
took the mare out in front and she was
never headed, running the mile with 147
pounds, up In 1:49 3-5, a new association
record.. Frank Skinner finished a clpse
second with Carlolly. Ethel G was -third.
' Honoma, ridden by\ Frank Skinner, ;also
won the five-eighths mile handicap, .Cap
tain McKlttrick's mare, . Helen Warwick,
showed improved track manners arid' it
required all Skinner's skill to lan<i"his
mount Jlrs't. \u25a0 ,'. . \u0084 tt^-of
J.*"C. HayeB"..Jr. plloted^two winners,
while Messrs. Skinner, Marsh and Smyth
rode. one each. â¢ - '*'>'""

.. Hoch der Kaiser! - Deutschland, a 25
to 1 shot, from Barney "Schreiber's
stable, paralyzed -the .. big. Saturday
crowd at Oakland yesterday by going
out in ..the fIOOO Norfolk handicap, one
mild and; 100 yards, and spreadeagling
the big field... . . ...
The victory of . the Sain horse came
as, a sudden surprise, 'for it was. not
supposed that- he could . negotiate the
track, which was heavy _ ajia cuppy In
places. '\u25a0'\u25a0 Tommy Clark; sat In the sad
dle and so friendless was the Schrelber
entry that his. clean cut' win figured -as
an eagle bird for the majority of books.
Nlgrette poked along second, a cou
ple of lengths "in advance of Lady
Goodrich. "Packy" Ryan's" black horse
San Nicolas occupied tlie post of honor
in the betting. He appeared sad and
forlorn looking on the way to the post,
and seemed as much at hornÂ« in the
footing as a hoboe doing a skirt dance.
THREE CHOICES SCORE.
Three public choices, two rank out
siders and a. second choice were re
turned wlnne"Fs 'at the wire. The ring
was jammed with speculators. â¢
C. Miller sent the favorite players
home heavy in heart and light .of
pocket by creeping; up on Soufriere, a
15 to 1" shot, in the concluding: sprint
on the card, and beating out Judge. a
nose. The latter had no excuse, for
he got away sailing and then began
looking for a stop-over privilege* tho
last â¢ eighth, when challenged by the
winner.- Romalne, ; the -heavily backed
9to-5 second choice, might have won
with arr even break. He was swung off
three, lengths behind the bunch and
then made a remarkable run.
Blumenthal Is a hard luck horse and
no mistake. One day little Barrett
does a highland fling- on his back; next
time out he. Is almost left at the post.
The Ezell entry closed a 3 to I favorite
for the opening- scramble, when -6 to -5
looked a liberal quotation. He 'got
away- next to- tast from the barrier and
then "had-Bucolic extended to the- last
ounce at the wire, to win by a' length:
"Ha-ndridlng" Kelly .piloted, the" winner,
which was played from 8 to 4. Sacred
us was third.- v, â¢- . -.
' BYROXKRDALE A WIVXEII. '
Byrorierdale showed to be pounds best
of the seven starters In the seven and a
half furlong selling run, or he could nev
er have won. Ridden by Knapp, the big
gelding was sharply cut off on three sep
arate occasions,' after which he scored
handily from Epicure' and Warte Nicht.
Epicure has rickety underpinning, or
there would have been nothing to the
race. â¢ â¢ . \u25a0
' It's almost a shame to relate what
Charlatan did to I'm Joe In the Orsinl
handicap, for ctwo-year-olds, at six :fur
longs.. Two-horse races never are satis
factory, this one proved no 'excepr
tlon to the rule. It looked as If Charlatan
could have beaten Joe at \ inch 'heats
yesterday. The sharpshooters wanted
nothing but Charlatan, so the bookmak
ers'peddled out tlckets'at even money un
til the bell rang, and hiked the price
about I'm Joe to 9to 5. The latter led
to the stretch, where the favorite, with
Radtke up, ran over him, breezing In first
by half a dozen . lengths. â¢
Away poorly Tenordale lost the show to
Arestallator by a narrow margin.
KXAPP'S VIGOROUS FIXISII.
"Big Bill" Knapp's vigorous finishing
powersalone landed the 'mile and a six
teenth selling purso for Flaunt, the
favorite. . The track suited ' Possart to
perfection and with Emmett Loague up
the friends of the black horse unllmbered.
As it transpired this Was another two
horse affair, the balance of the starters
being lost sight of. early. An eighth
of a mile from Jhe stand it looked dollars
to doughnuts Possart would deliver, 'wh^n
Knapp. brought all of his artillery to
bear, and In the most exciting finish of
the day his mount received the ver*
diet by a neck. The show went to Ban
nock Belle. ": .

HELMS FLEES
TO THE EAST
Policeman Leaves Scene of
Troubles in Order, to De
feat the Alimony Order
$AILS LETTER AT RENO
Writes to Corporal Layrie
Declaring He Did Not Run
From Criminal Charges
Patrolman John 11. Helms, whose
name was mentioned in connection with
the police scandal, has decamped. Rather
than pay alimony to his divorced wifo
he tendered . his resignation to the Po
lice Department and is now speeding
eastward regardless of consequences
and determined that .he shall be with
out jurisdiction of the court and not
fcuhservient to Its order.
Helms has not reported for several
days to the Mission station, to which he
was assigned. His excuse was that he
was ill and unable to perform his duty.
After leaving his wife he changed his
address to the Valencla-Btreet Hotel,
73 8 Valencia street. While occupying
apartments in this hostelry he was very
uncommunicative, but never expressed
any word that would indicate- that he
was about to leave the city. When he
came to the hotel he had two satchels
and he paid onÂ« month's room rent in
advance. Proprietor Bush states that
Helms left his apartment last Wednes
day, but as his accounts were all settled
\u25a0with the house, the landlord paid no
attention to tho matter. . -
The latter part of Helms" resignation
would Indicate that he had for some time
Intended to take the course he did. In a
letter received from Reno, last
night by Corporal Layne of the Mission
station the policeman confides that he
will not return to this city, and that he
will refuse to pay the alimony that was
allowed his wife. The latter portion of
his resignation is as follows:
"If I thought for an instant that there
were any charges of a criminal nature
against me I would stay until I cleared
myself, but as you have Indisputable evi
dence that aU such charees were entirely
false and uncalled for and the only re
maining charge Is that alleging cruelty
to my wife, which was proved to the
Judge's satisfaction by perjury and
shaded and contorted testimony, I do not
feel justified to prove otherwise and per
haps lose aram through the same course.
"I hereby respectfully tender my resig
nation as police officer of the San Fran
cisco Police Department and sincerely
thank you for Droving those infamous
allegations entirely untrue and without
foundation of fact. Respectfully,
"JOHN H. HELMS."
Model Yacht* WIU Race To-Day.
The regular quarterly regatta of the
San Francisco Model Yacht Club will be
held at Spreckels Lake, Golden Gate
Park, this 'afternoon. It is an Intermedi
ate regatta, the winner of which will have
the right to challenge for the Dickie cup
on Washington's birthday. The Perpetu
al Challenge Dickie cup is held by Louis
Petersen's Stella. : Â»
The first and second Dickie cup races
were won by M- % London's Cricket. The
Stella won the last regatta and later
took the challenge cup from the Cricket.
Petersen will have his crack boat In
the races to-day and will also enter his
new boat. Petrel. â¢ The Stella will be his
chief reliance, and It would not be sur
prising If the honors went to that model.
The Stella has won twelve out of the last
fifteen Sunday pennant races, and has
proved herself the fastest boat in the
fleet.
London's Cricket met with a mishap
two weeks agoT but he has- been work
ing on her ever since, and she should be
In good shape to-day.
Henry London's speedy Imp, the vet
eran of the fleet, will be In the competi
tion and certainly has a good chance, to
win. The Imp will probably be the hard
est boat for the Stella to beat
Other boats that will race are Doyle's

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL,- SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3^1905;
CUP OFFERED
FOR NEW GAME
Stanford Club Gives Artis
tic Trophy for an Asso
ciation Football Contest
MAY START A 'REFORM
Intention Is Not to Make
This a Substitute for
an Intercollegiate Match
At a monthly meeting of the Stanford
flub of. San Francisco yesterday it was
unanimously voted to offer a magnificent
silver cup as an interclaas trophy for a
series of association football games, to be
played during next January and Febru
ary at theÂ« Leland Stanford Junior
University. A committee consisting of
George E. Crothers, Archie Rice and Oli
ver P. Morton was authorized to com
plete all necessary arrangements for the
enthusiastic inauguration of the new col
legiate sport. All three of the committee
men were memhers of the first big class
that graduated from Stanford, Crothers
and Ilice having been presidents of the
class. Crothers is also a trustee of Stan
ford University and at present is acting
treasurer. Rice is a veteran critic of the
varsity game of football.
In advocating the new game the alumni
are indorsing the sport purely on Its mer
its as a pastime, in which no man is
handicapped because of 'diminutive sta
ture or light weight.
It is not the intention to introduce this
sport as a substitute for the varsity con
test, but as a game that will appeal
strongly to the great body of undergrad
uates, who from the specialized nature
of the already practiced varsity sports
are left no popular exciting athletic pas
time in which they may engage.
The alumni want to back a game that
will appeal to the largest number for
their actual participation. They believe
association football, with ; its open play
and drastic measures against any kind of
rough tactics, will prove: of itself the
tonic needed to remove from the varsity
game, its most objectionable features.
Stanford's forty-acre jj athletic field
has a special section reserved for. the
association game, but it is probable
the great new stadium will be used
for the new sport. In putting up the
beautiful trophy and indorsing: asso
ciation football the Stanford Alumni
have set forth these objects:
"We believe it is the most democratic
and inexpensive - general outdoor col
legiate game. We believe that In. at
tracting a large number of men who
otherwise would devote no time to
profitable outdoor sports it will do
much to develop a love of sport for
sport's sake, and for its benefits to the
participants. We believe * that asso
ciation football, with its average of SOO
kicks to a game, where varsity football
does not average forty, will of itself
point the way to a logical and satisfac
tory reform of the existing style of in
tercollegiate football. We believe that
Stanford with a record of fifteen years
of remarkably clean football and also
as champion of the Pacific Coast for the
last two seasons is well qualified to in
augurate this purely kicking game,, and
that its success at Stanford will insure
its future as a Western Intercollegiate
sport as well as a popular campus
pastime.
"In offering the "trophy cup we do it
with these obviously amateur provi
sions: First, there shall be no admis
sion charged at any game of the cup
series, and second, every, player shall
personally defray the expenses of hia
playing outfit, which is a meager ex
ercising suit, consisting of - a .light
Jersey, light running pants cut off
above the knee, heavy stfteklngs and a
pair of stout shoes. Xo other outfit is
necessary and such an equipment
would last one player several seasons."
Varsity football costs thousands of
dollars a year for equipment and the
spectators are taxed high for admis
sion. This makes the game savor too
etrongly of professionalism.
The Association Football Union,
through its officers and various clubs,
has. eagerly volunteered to help Stan
ford in every way possible, supplying
picked teams necessary" for exhibition
games and helping to start the sport
properly.

Left-winger Hitt hooked up. with
Shields, his left-handed brother In the
business, yesterday at the Eighth
street lot. Any. one. who watched the
game could see Hitt had the goods and
the ,' support while Shields was. not
possessed of either. Consequently the
Seals did not have" to' work hard to
bring home the victory. It. was their
from the fourth inning on and the Si
washes, did not even dispute it.
Hitt's pitching was the x only^ thing
that made the game worth while. Sen
sations did not happen at all. There
were no chances for 'the fielders to
make spectacular stops and throws
and long hits were conspicuous be
cause they did not happen often
enough to be noticed. The. cold
weather was the predominating fea
ture, t
The Seals broke in with a run in
the fourth spasm, when Hlldebrand
got a life on Hall's boot and House
holder sent him along with a drive to
center. Irwin dispatched a grounder
too hot for Richards to handle and the
run came over. That was a starter,
but the next Inning produced three and
made the game a mortal cinch for
Uncle.
Hitt inaugurated it with a single to
right and~ Waldron followed with one
to third. Both men advanced on a
passed ball. Kid Mohler unloaded a
double-cushion swat to the flagpole,
which let both scamper in. . Hlldebrand
Jald down a bunt and Blankenship let
It get away from him, sending Mohler
around> to third. He arrived as Nealon
worked the squeeze play with a bunt.
The season will come to an inglori
ous end this afternoon. The score: \u25a0 '

KUBELIK, THE VIOLINIST,
TO TAKE UP POLITICS

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalU
LONDON, Dec. 2.â Jan Kubelik,
most successful of" living violinists, is
going in for politics, and when he gets
over to the United States he will' keep
an eye on affairs of state over there,
in-the hope of picking up some points
that. will be useful in cast^he decides
to become a law-maker, for hid beloved
Bohemia. J
It is all right to say "in case he de~
cides to become," because all this mar
ket-gardener s son has to do in order
to enter the Bohemian Legislature is
to step in and take his seat. The Amer
ican collars, the .English pounds, and
the marks, francs and kroner of the
Continent that this winning young man
has enticed into his pocket by means of
his magic bow, together with some of
the shekels of the rich Countess he
married, were invested in an imposing
castle on a rich estate that happened
to be a sort of pocket-borough, in Bo
hemia/ His district is entitled to one
member, and as Jan Kubelik is, so, to
speak, the only voter in the district of
which he 13 proprietor, It. is considered
reasonably certain that he would have
a safe majority whenever he decided to
stand as a candidate. Air that prevents
him at present Is a fear that he would
not win his own support. He is afraid
he doesn't know enough about politics
to make him xas useful a legislator as
he would like to be. He is really bent
on being something besides an idol of
the concert hall, as his conversation
shows.
WANTS TO BE USEFUL.
"I really want to be useful to Bohe
mia," said Kubelik, twisting his slen
der figures nervously about his knee.
"Most Bohemians never get out' of the
country, whereas j I have' traveled all*
over the world and think that maybe 1
could bring some broader ideas to a
Parliament that is virtually standing
still, wasting. time over sectional issues.
1 am going to read the newspapers in
America with much care, for over there
you don't talk so much and do more.
We quarrel over trine 3. It Is a great
pity more has not been done to solve
the question of the equilibrium between
Germans and Bohemians. Both nations
have their rights in Bohemia, but, of
course, I think the Germans want too
much. If I become a legislator I shall
want to work. Dvorak was made a
member of what you would call our
Senate, but that was entirely an honor.
He did no wprk and never went near
the place."
I asked Kubelik what his greatest
ambition was, and the response was
prompt and definite.
\u0084 "To be entirely my own master," he
said. I asked him what he meant by
this, but he was content to let the
statement go unexplained, further than
to say that although be would be glad
enough to be very rich he had no ambi
tion to become a Vanderbilt, and that
his idea of the best use of wealth was,
as he expressed it, "to do good things
for people."
: aiusic good for public.
Kubelik has a poor opinion of : music as
an occupation for any one j who Is riot
especially gifted. < He seemed to believe
that there was les3 intermediate ground
in music than in any. other profession
between great success and comparative
drudgery.
"Music," he said, "is good for : : the
public, but- bad' for the artist; those
who are not very successful are as a
rule very hard up. : If any boy of; girl
should come to me for advice about
taking up, music , , xas : " a . profession 'i I
would say: 'Don't do it if you can. pos-
Blbly do anything else.'. That;; would
be good advice, . because if that young
person had musical genius in him â¢ the
music would come out anyway, in spite
of anybody's advice." ' â¢-'. \u0084
"Do you want your little twin daugh
ters to become musicians?" :
"Not unless they, have great gifts for
it. yril .tell you, though, what I* do
wish, "and that, is .that 'one : of, them
should be a painter. : I loved "drawing
in school : and believe I' mightthave
been successful as -a painter if : I had
not been' a .musician. V_I V never miss a
picture gallery in any/city that; has .a
good "one. Whistler, i in- particular, ; is
my aelight.
. "The little girls are fifteen .: months
old; now;.' and;, of course,' I shall itry i to
teach -.them music,; not necessarily with
the ' idea of â¢ making "> musicians! (of
them, but 'because the teaching: would
enable ' them \u25a0>to < listen 'to \u25a0 music â¢ with
different ; ears. ' Already ?, they < are .- re
markably attentive to Â«. the '%vlol ln,-", and
will ; stop crying '" instantly at ' any; time
if they/ hear' me, play. f ; l. don't believe
It i hurts .children " to N begin ; music |early
if , they, have a sense of ; muslc.V: It is an
instinct, and \ the gratification of \u25a0 it can
do : them I no " injury. .' : I ; began at ' 4 . and
it, didn't hurt - me, as 'you i see."" . / ;' . \u25a0â¢
; Evidently -It f didn't, sfor^ the S young
violinist's^ bro wn "eyes -are .clear, Tand
his nerves i are : sound, ; and ' he j appears
to be generally iri r the' pink of condition;
But'that perhaps ;}3; duei partlyHo; the
fact\ that^ he lives; as fsimply and (quietly
as if he 'were riot a public ! idol -'and^uite
able? tofgratify - every iwhlm;J:; He ; is !^aa

as if he had to live ", on a dollar a day.
COMING TO UNITED STATES.
Kubelik is going to stay' in the
United States from the end of Novem
ber till May, going across to San Fran
cisco and then on to Australia. After
that he wants to see Japan, not for the
purpose of giving concerts, but for the
purpose of studying the country. I The
charming .Countess, who is now Mrs.
Kubelik, is at present in London, but
"will not go to the United States until
next spring. The celebrated twins are
in Bohemia and Madame Kubelik will
probably return to them when her hus
band sails for America.
I asked Kubelik if he had noticed
any indication of change in the public's
musical taste.-
"No," he said, -"I -doubt if there Is
much tendency to change, except per
haps for a growlng^appreclatlon'of the
melancholy Russian folk songs. They
are beautiful music, and I should not
be surprised if/ the music of the future
came from Russia. But the old.classic
al"-music . Is. after all .what -the more
thoughtful element of the public wants.
The, other part of the public wants
virtuosity. As for me, perhaps my fa
vorite of all the composers Is Handel.
Yes, I think he appeals to me even
more than Bach, although It would take
more of the English language than 1
know'* to- tell exactly why. Perhaps I
couldn't tell why anyway, for one's
Instincts are not to be explained.
"Of course I should like to be a com
poser, too, and- I 1I 1 have a good many
odds and ends of compositions lying
around somewhere, but in- order to do
really effective wilting in music you
must live in It and mus.t not be inter
rupted. The music --must come in one
string with no knots in It. I think I
have some ideas, and some day I shall
stop making big tours and. shall see If
I cannot write some music that will
live. But In the meantime I. am going
to keep my eyes open and see If I can't
be of some real political use to my
native land."-

continued throughout Friday. The po
lice fired on the strikers several times,
killing seven and wounding seventeen.
I The mob was" very determined and
refused to listen to its own delegates,
who met the Governor and secured ah
assurance from him that an inquiry
would be made into their grievances
and redress afforded if possible. The
delegates advised the men to retire
peaceably and .to remove their hats as
a. sign of acquiescence, but they be
came uproarious and shouted that they
would not do so. They then got be
yond control and invaded the public
buildings, from which the Governor
and other officials did not venture un
til, evening, when- they were escorted
to their homes by policemen.
Windows throughout the city were
smashed and the electric street rail
road ceased running.
The rioting was continued to-day.
LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS
' ARE BASKET BALL CHAMPIONS
Defeat the Representative* of Berkeley
.. High School by a Score
of 6 to 5.
Lowell High School girls are
champions of the Girls' Academic Ath
letic League in basket ball, having de
feated the Berkeley : High girls in a
well-fought contest on the Reliance
Club courts yesterday morning. The
final score was 6 to 5 in favor of the
Lowell athletes.
Lowell jumped into the running from
the start. Two field goals by Miss Eloise
Scoville and a foul by Berkeley \ netted
them a, tota^ of five points for the first
half. Berkeley had plenty of opportunities
to score owing to the numerous times
the Lowell girls fouled, but their throw-,
ing was off a little.
In the second half the girls from the
college town seemed to play together, for
their team, work was much better than in
the first half of play. Lowell gained their
sixth and last point on a foul. After that
Lowell fouled three times, but only one
goal was thrown by Berkeley. Miss Alma
Scott of Berkeley then jumped into prom
inence by throwing a difficult field goal.
Toward the last few minutes of play Miss
Alma Scott, also of Berkeley, duplicated
the trick, giving her team their last two
points.
The members of the* winning team were:
Goalsâ Miss Ruth Lewis. Miss Eloise
Scoville and Miss Alice Thompson; cen
ters â Miss Evelyn Carson, Miss Olga
Hurting, Miss Elizabeth Vail and Miss
Edith Pence; guardsâ Miss Hazel Hillar,
Miss Belle Gluckman and Miss Lulu
Rubke; substitutes. Miss Alice Patterson
and Miss H.* Abbott
The Berkeley team consisted of: Goals^ â
Miss Edith Laird, Miss Gladys, Pendleton
and Miss Alma Scott; centers â Miss/H.
Harris, Miss J. .de Jarnette and Miss
Doris Spencer* guardsâ Miss Clarice Da
vis, Miss Susie Irwin and Miss Madge
Spencer.
Officialsâ Umpires.- Miss Edna de Wolf
and Miss Aura Lee of the University -of
California; referee, Miss L. Williams of
the University fo California. Score, S-5.

MRS. WALDORF
SHOWS LETTERS
BERKELEY.. Dec. 2.â The" poGce.have
net -located Jacob .Waldorf, whose wife
accuses him of having- eloped Tilth Miss
Ada Moore of Oakland, the pretty young
giri employed in the Ramofia candy fac
tpry. for which the missing husband was
city salesman In San Francisco. " Mrs.
Waldorf was left destitute with two
young children. She has made public the
letters signed "Ada" she found in his
clothe*. In giving the missives publicity
Mrs. Waldorf said:
"I visited the home of Mis 3 Moore in
Oakland, en Market street, Thanksgiving
day to see if thty knew where my hus
band was or where Miss Moore was. I
learned enough to prove-to me that the
Moores know of their daughter's infatua
tion for my husband.
"Waldorf .has- written to me from San
Francisco asking me to send him the
letters from Ada Moore to him, which
he knows I have. He promises to send
me money If I will send the letters
and he wants them addressea to him
in -care of the general delivery depart
ment of the city postoflice, I shall Eve
hlm.fora divorce-and for support and
the letters will be* used as evidence in
court." â¢
The letters from Miss Moore to Wal
dorf were written about ten days ago.
In them the girl addresses Waldorf al
ways as "My dear sweetheart." A
specimen paragraph is the following:
LOVIXG ' Jf ISSIVE>.
"My. Dear Sweetheart â This Is Sat
urday evening and as I am alone I
think the best thing I- can do Is to
write to my dear one. I did so. want
to see you this morning. Did you hear
some one come in the little ofSce while
you were in talking? It. was me. I
wanted to hear your sweet- voice, so
went in and got a handkerchief out of
my grip."
Miss Moore refers in her letter to. a
"curtain lecture" -her sister Annie had
given her after the sister had seen her
in company with Wa!dorf> The girl
intimates her appreciation of the situa
tion she created by her association
with a married man. .She signs the
letter In question: "Good night, sweet
heart. Your own little girl, Ada."
Another letter refers- to a clandes
tine meeting af the "park" on a rainy
day. an event which the writer says
she "wouldn't miss for the world."
This letter Is signed "Your . loving
sweetheart.". .
Mrs. Waldorf resents the statement- of
Mrs. Moore, mother of Ada, wherein Mrs.
Moore Intimates that if Mrs. Waldorf, has
lest- her husband. It "serves her right
for running around- herself with other
men." \u25a0"" - , "\u25a0' - .-- [â¢\u25a0" -\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 . \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-.â¢ : , .._..'\u25a0
, *That Is a cruel slander,*', said Mrs.
Waldorf to-tf ay. "Mr. Waldorf . never
even- breathed a word against my char
acter, always ..admitting, _ even when. , J
charged him with unfaithf ulness, that I
had iÂ»een- a true wife." > - .. . ..
GIR UB WHEUEADOCTS 5 C.\K.\OWX.
Members of the famil^ of Miss Moore
cay they have heard nothing - from her
pine*, they received her note .saying that
she wes going on a visit to some friends
outside tUe dry. -Inquiry, at the Moore
home to-night; was â¢ answered v by Percy
Moore, a brother of me na losing, girl, who
raid:
"Personally I \ knew .; no t h! ngr about - her
going with this man Waldorf until I heard
that she had run away' with him.''. Had I
known that she was rnaklnc a practice of
running around- with a married man I
would have taken , Immediate;: steps Ito
break it up. Of course. I amnot'cure that
she has, eloped "with this man, and I hate
to .think i that she would do such ; a thing.
I regrÂ«t that my mother, In her "confusion

POLICE CAPTAIN
IS EXONERATED
Board Finds Accused Officer
Guiltless of Charge of
Having Been Intoxicated
BEPEDLAND FOB SPEECH
Commissioners Object to an
Excoriating Address De
livered in San Francisco
OAKLAND. Dec 2.â Captain of Police
W. J. Petersen was exonerated *by the
Beard of Police and- Fire Commissioners
to-day en' charges of drunkenness lodged
against him by San Francisco policemen,
who had reported to Chief of Police Dlnan
acicss the bay that they had sÂ«Â«n Peter
sen intoxicated at the Union depot.
As soon as the accusation was made
public Captain Petersen demanded an in
vestigation by his superiors, which was
held. Shortly before the charge of un
seemly conduct was given publicity Cap
tain Petersen 'delivered an address before
the Young Men's Christian Association ia
San Francisco, in which he severely criti
cized conditions across the bay with re
lation to the police handling of various
forms of 'vice. That speech the Police
Commissicneis in their findings to-day
declared ill advised, indecorous and un
wise.
During the hearing the San Francisco
policemen admitted that they were led to
make their charge because of the attack
Captain Petersen had made on San Fran
cisco. .
The Commissioners to-day declared that
the accusing policemen were mistaken In
fheir identification and that Captain Pe
tersen was not the man they had seen at
the -U nion depot last spring. The decision
is given by reason of the records of the
Oakland PoUee Department and the tes
timony cf seven members of the depart
ment showing, that it Is improbable that
Captain - Petcrsen was in San Francisco
at the times mentioned in the charges.
The beard finally, after declaring it does
not wish to abridge the right of any of
ficial or employe of the city to exercise
the right of free speech, says the address
by Captain Petersen tended to strain re
lations between the two departments. The
board said such conduct would not be
tolerated in the future.

Indebtedness Is now %Sii,flOJ,oo>J. while
the County Council is committed to

necessary because London's municipal

There is at present a hugre scheme
being hatched by a combination of
English and American financiers to" se

metropolis. " Dazzling- promises are
made of electric power beiriar sold at "a

poses laying- out its power plant fifty
miles from London, near suitable coal

Council is in favor of presenting a. bill
of its own to Parliament next year to
secure this municipal. utility itself and
save the citizens from beiny placed in
the power of a trust, withj as.:he only
means of escape, the right to buy- it out
at an enormous premium, as In the case
of the water companies.

of victory In a Tory Parliament, amd.
even With a Liberal Parliament' ahead,

LONDON, Dec. Z.â The old Duchess of

plucky- fight against neuritis, which is
steadily growing- worse and is now af
fecting her heart. She sturdily opposed
tbe Duke's suggestion that she counter
mend her big house party at Chats
worth. ,
The Duchess of Connaught. who was
among her guests, was appalled when
she saw her hostess and desired to
leave Immediately, considering it-un
kind to impose the duty of entertaining
on one so desperately 111. but was per
suaded that nothing would hurt tha
Duchess more, and the only rear kind
ness to her now. was to humor her
fancy for discharging the duties of
granSe dame to* the last. \u25a0 * â -
The most extraordinary feature of
her case is her keen anxiety that the
Duke should marry again. In her circle
It Is freely rumored that she has made
him solemnly promise he would marry
Miss^ Muriel Wilson, whose beauty and
talents they txuh" have long admired.
The Duchess thinks the Duke should
provide a direct heir for the title, which
would be " rather unfortunate - for his

"I thought from the first," she added,

Then somebody enlightened her.
"Perhaps you didn't look In the right

article in the magazine La Revue re
lates an alleged conversation with
President Roosevelt, who predicts the
speedy arrival Â©X an era, hitherto- un

avoid all war. basing the conduct of
world affairs on the principle that their
deeper interests are necessarily iden

powers agree to adopt among them
selves a regime of friendly understand
ings they could even prevent the others
from troubling the universal peace, and
this combination is already in process
of construction.

and Mis. Roosevelt keenly Interested In
all "tbfngs concerning France and glad
of an -opportunity of bearing and

Si*cial Dispatch \o The CÂ»ll
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â Residents of
Dobbs Ferry are worrying over the pro
tracted absence of "Andy" Fields, a pil
lar of the Methodist church and president
of the Dobbs Ferry Athletic Club; also
over the scarcely less protracted and
equally inexplicable absence of Louis Â«F.
Murray, who was prominently Identified
with the Methodist church. Murray
flashed Jnto prominence on Friday be-
cause lie could not be found by subr>ena
servers who wanted him to testify before
the Armstrong insurance Investigating
committee.
While no man may say where Field
and Murray now are. it is generally un
derstood In Dobbs Ferry that they arÂ«
members of the California colony of New
York insurance officials, all of whom
Counsel Hughe.* desires to get in front
of him on the witness stand.
The trustees of the New York Life ln
smance Company have been made .the
individual defendants in a suit brought to
hold them responsible to the company's
policyholders for sums improper^ di
verted to Andrew ' Hamilton and not ac
counted for on the books of the com
pany. Former Judge Hiram R. Steel and
other members of the board have been
served with the complaint, and some of
them are considerably worried over the
matter and have taken steps toward mak
ing a concerted defense. The complain
ants in the suit are polieyholders of Sar
atoga County.
Thomas F. Ryan is expected tp be a
mitneps before the Armstrong committee
during the coming week and Hughes will
then Question him. Hughes and his col
leagues are preparing for a busy week.
John J. O'Rourke, manager of a large
business concern on Worth street and a
policy-holder in the Equitable, recently
\u25a0wrote this letter to Paul Morton:
"As a policy-holder In the Equitable
Life Assurance Society 1 should like to
be informed In regard to the expenses of
the special trustees, Cleveland, O'Brien
arid Westinghouse. . who represent the
Ryan holdings of stock in the society.
"It is alleged that ofHce rent, secre
taries' salaries, clerk . hire, stationery,
hotel bills and all other charges for
administration which are being in
curred by these gentlemen in the exer
cise of their functtons as guardians of
Mr. Ryan's interests are being liqui
dated by the society, which, of course,
implies that the policy-holders are pay
ing the bills. Will you kindly advise
me whether this assertion, in whole or
part, has any foundation of fact?"
To this. O'Rourke received this reply
from Morton, under date of November
2Sth:
"The trustees have up to date re
ceived no compensation of any kind.
The expenses that they are put to in
having certain work done in the inter
ests of the policy-holders is being
borne by the society."
