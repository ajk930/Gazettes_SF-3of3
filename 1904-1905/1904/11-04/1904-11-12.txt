NEW YORK. Nov. 1Lâ Pacific Mail
Steamship stock furnished material for

count of Thomas W. Lawson's adver
tisement offering to pay $70 a share
for "substantially all the outstanding
minority stock, provided I can pur

Although stories were circulated of

that the Pacitic Mall episode was mere

This was officially denied.

"F. S. Miller, the cashier of the de
funct 'Hot Air* bank at Coachella, has
a bad financial record here. He was
an officer of two institutions that went
to pieces In Cleveland, the Superior
Street Savings Bank and the Northern
Ohio Building and Loan Company.
Poor investors and depositors lost
heavily by these failures and there was
hot indignation against Miller and the
other officers, one of whom subsequent
ly committed suicide. Although the
two concerns were 'rotten* from end
to end the schemers who worked them
kept shrewdly within the law and at
tempt* to prosecute them â¢ criminally
failed."'. .'v .Â¦:;Â¦.
Only the good folk in the canteloupe
town knew that the bankrupt's liabil
ties represent their hard earned
money, while his assets are mostly
shares in a projected Ice plant, paid for
by a check on his own bogus bank.
It Is said the law cannot touch the
bankruptcy banker. No magnate , of
frenzied finance could have been more
careful in keeping on the right side of
the legal fence. â
Bodenhamer is to appear in San
Bernardino for examination on an em
bezzlement charge next Friday. He
charges all the trouble to Miller.
A special dispatch from Cleveland,
Ohio, giving Miller's record says:
Before trying to get away Boden
hamer , had gone to 8an Bernardino
and filed a schedule' in bankruptcy.
The document was duly recorded and
it read in the papers as a very re
spectable bankruptcy â not more than
a few hundred dollars shy.
Bodenhamer was arrested trying to
get out of the country, but Miller wad
not caught. The melon growers havo
receipts for their money. Mill-jr Is
supposed to have the cash. Not so
much as a pair of cast off trousers
did the bankers leave in Coachella.
The pile of bricks that composed the
tank building Is for sale and tha uu
paid man who made the bricks finds
he must pay the bank's receiver S500
for an overdraft.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 11. â Six
months ago when the most promising
cantaloupe season ever known was
opening on the irrigated southwest
ern spur of the Colorado desert. Paul
Bodenhamer and F. S. Miller ap
peared in the thriving new town of
Coachella. Without a cent of capital,
as it now develops, they established
the Coachella Valley Bank. To-day
Bodenhamer, who became president
of the institution,* is enjoying liberty
under bonds; Miller, the erstwhile
cashier, is a fugitive from Justice,
supposedly in the East. The bank is
wrecked and the people of the val
ley lose practically all the money they
had.
Bodenhamer and Miller, it now trans
pires, tried to borrow money to start
the bank. Failing in this, one of them
resorted to the trick of forwarding his'
check to a friend or accomplice in Riv
erside and having it cashed with the
understanding that it was not to be
presented for payment for a week. A
few piles of glittering gold, the pro
ceeds from this trick, were displayed
on the bank tables, and Bodenhamer
and Miller, I ensconced in an unpald
for new brick building, were ready for
business.
Such an Institution was needed, and
the patron&sap.-rwj.t good. Trainload
after -trainktid of -melons ;' rnovedviHit
and the golden . returns flowed' in to
the growers, who .cleaned up over $150 -
000. Confidingly they deposited in this
new bank. Even the Indians on a
nearby reservation who had flourished
as cantaloupe growers were â¢ roped in
as depositors.
The check in Riverside was redeemed
with the deposits of the bank's first
customers and apparently everything
went swimmingly. The bank prosper
ed so that. enlargement was talked of
by its management. When the last
quarterly report was due Bodenhamer
and â¢ Miller worked late one Friday
night; the whole town knew, while it
watched the glimmer of their oil lamp,
that its financial wardens were terrib
ly busy making up a great balance.
Saturday afternoon Bodenhamer and
Miller, jaded from their hard work,
strolled to the railway station. They
were going out of town to rest over
Sunday, they told their friends. Trains
east and west were due to pass at the
same hour. It was noticed that Miller
went east and Bodenhamer west. Mon
day the bank did not open. It was
found, too, that the fashionable house
keeper of its two managers had de
parted.

It was a heartrending sight when
the bodies were taken from the burning
building. Women fainted and stal
wart men cried and wrung their
hands. The most pitiful sight was the
struggle of the little boy against
death. Miss Weber was badly burned
about the upper part of the body,
while htr mother was burned In the
lower part. A singular fact was that
the room from which the bodies were
taken was not on fire at the time of
the removal. The bodies were blazing,
however, and appearances would Indi
cate that the murderer had set fire to
the bodies and then dragged them to
the room. There was no odor of oil
on the clothing of the victims and the
doors of the house were all locked.
Weber was seen by Fred Rechen
ir.achtr at 4 o'clock, and he in
good spirits. Little Frances Snowden
called at the Weber home at 6:30. The
family was at the supper table.
The body of Julius Weber was found

AUBURN. Nov. 1Lâ Mystery still
enshrouds the Weber case. The au
topsy physicians have just finished an
examination of the body of Julius We
ber, which was found this morning.
A bullet wound was in his breast sim
ilar to the ones found in the breasts
of Mrs. Weber and her daughter and
caused his death. A 22-caiiber rifle
was found beside Weber. The bullets
taken from the bodies of Mrs. Weber
and Miss Weber were 32-caliber. So
far there is no evidence to show any
motive for the crime.
of the house. The other bodies were
found in the front part of the house.
Adolph Weber, the only member of
the family alive, was downtown at the
time the fire was discovered. He had
purchased a pair of trousers at Cohen's
store, donned them and was doing
some other errands when the flre was
discovered. When he reached the
burning house he threw his old trou
sers, which were wrapped up, through
a window to break it. His hand was
badly cut by the glass and later he
was overcome and taken to town,
where he spent the night with friends.
Young Weber was interviewed by
Sheriff Keena and District Attorney
Robir.son this morning. He did not
advance any theory and said he did not
know of anv enemies that the family
had, and that he did not think rob
bery could have been the motive.
When he left the house about one hour
before the flre he said his father was
reading in the kitchen, his mother was
getting the baby to sleep and his sis
ter was playing at the piano. This lat
ter fact has been verified by neigh
bors who heard the piano.
Young Weber also stated during the
interview that his father had a fierce
temper. The fact is well known in
Auburn, but it receives but little at
tention, as Weber senior was known
to b^ an extremely lovable man at
home. Adolph Weber is a very quiet
youth. He is a great reader and
thinker, and devotes considerable time
to chess and the study of palmistry.
His peculiar actions to-day are not
considered unreasonable because of his
peculiar temperament.

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 11.â It is

North Sea incident, which they regard
as premature, declaring that it will
be time enough to talk of punishment
when the commission establishes their
culpability.
Referring to Lord Lansdowne's arbi

opinion to-day that such an offer, even
coming from Japan, could not possi
bly be accepted. >
"Such a controversy." he said, "can
not be arbitrated. The idea . is not
worth considering. We believe the war
has reached the turn of the tide, and
it must go on. The only possibility
of peace now, in my opinion, would be
on the basis of a proposition submit

hostilities opened. As it is inconceiv
able that Japan at this juncture is
prepared to offer such terms, I see no
chance of ending the war."

LONDON, Nov. 11.â The" diÂ«patch
from. Washington confirming the state
ment made that Japan had indicated
her willingness to entertain peace sug
gestions from President Roosevelt or
King Edward created much interest
here. Baron Hayashi, the Japanese
Minister, said to-day:
"After the fall of Port Arthur Japan
would, I believe, be ready to treat for
peace on no higher essential basis than
that Russia should evacuate Man
churia, Japan also agreeing to a similar
evacuation. The two great difficulties
in the wav of any suggestion of peace
are, first, the apparent opposition of
Emperor Nicholas' present advisers to
a" settlement of any kind; second, the
preservation of Russian prestige. When
a nation's prestige, if not gone, is
severely impaired, it is a difficult mat
ter, even with the best of intentions, to
preserve it." â¢ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ â¢
It is learned that Queen Alexandra
has been in constant communication
with the Dowager Empress of -Russia
and . Emperor Nicholas himself during
the last few days. *
The reiteration of the American State
Department's determination not to in
tervene except on request from both of
the belligerents tallies with the official
attitude of the British Government, but
it is thought that before long some
method may privately be devised
whereby this diplomatic barrier to ac
tion may be overcome. ,

news from Port Arthur and discredited
the rumors of its capitulation.

identified with the movement which
led to the Anglo-French arbitration
treaty) that M. Cambon, the French
Embassador to London, after confer

Paris to discuss Anglo-French media

Thomas' statement is purely specula

M. Cambon while he was at the For

Petersburg, whereas Great Britain and
the United States do not exert strong
influence at St Petersburg. Therefore
France's only activity in such a Joint
effort would be at St. Petersburg. But
this involves important considerations
relating to Russia's relations with Eu
ropean powers. France does not de
sire to exert an influence on Russia
that would be distasteful to her or tend
to weaken the alliance. In fact, some
of the reports of France's intention to
influence Russia are attributed to cer
tain European political quarters, which
are seeking to break the Franco-Rus
sian alliance In order to profit thereby
to France's detriment. Therefore
France will use the utmost circumspec
tion concerning any Joint movement
wherein her role will be solely to in
fluence Russia in a manner which Rus
sia does not regard as contrary to her
interests.

NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â Thomas F.
Goodrich, a banker, died as the direct
result of worry over the frauds-per
petrated in the promotion of the ship
yard trust, according to the statement
made by, medical "men to-day. He wa3
buried to-day at Oswego.
The startling facts in relation as to
the cause -of his death were made
public shortly after his body had
been placed in the grave. Heart dis
ease was the immediate cause of his
death, which was very sudden.
Goodrich was vice president of the
National Surety Company and was one
of "the men dragged into the legal re
sponsibilities, although, perhaps, re
ally innocent. As a director of the
company, he, vwith others, permitted
the company to Issue a notoriously
false prospectus and : with others i was
at the time of, his death defendant in
suits for many millions lost by the un
fortunates who were deluded by that
document.

she said, was at Miss Dolbeer's side.
Eugene Hudgins, a reporter, who was
the next witness, s.aid it was from Dr.
Homer Gibney that he learned the es
sential facts of the report which he
made to his office regarding Miss Dol
beer's death.- He said that Dr. Gibney
had informed him that Miss Dolbeer
"was completely upset by her father's
death, she having been his inseparable
companion after the death of her
mother several years before, and Miss
Warren had taken charge of her."
"The doctor said," Hudgins con
tinued, "that Miss Warren had had a
hard time ever sinceieaving San Fran
cisco, and 'the constant vigilance which
she had been- compelled to keep 'over
her charge' had left her (Miss Warren)
little more than a nervous wreck her
self." During the morning of July 9,
Dr. Gibney said, according to the wit
ness, Miss Dolbeer . had been par
ticularly nervous. She had been un
able to get her mind concentrated on
anything, so had sat for hours in the
room gazing at her father's photograph
and weeping, and Miss Warren, fear-
Ing a possible attack of suicidal mania,
had gone into the hall and closed the
windows from the bottom, leaving them
open at the -v top for ventilation; the
heat becoming intense in the room, in
the late r afternoon the two women
walked out into the hall, trying to find
relief; they, returned to their rooms and
Miss Dolbeer'again \ went : into " the : hall
alone. Miss Warren, still fearing dis
aster, missed r her a; few moments and
tried* to run ; after her,* but her dress
caught In the ; hall door, : and she " got it
out just" in time to seer Miss Dolbeer
disappearing through the ; window.

NEW YORK, Nov. 11. â A small
schooner, bearing the name G. H. S.,
with a crew of twelve men, far out of
her course, with neither provisions
nor water and running helplessly be
fore a gale of hurricane force, was
sighted -and given assistance by the
Atlas line steamer Valencia on her
last outward voyage from this port.
The ultimate fate of the little craft
and her crew was.. not known to the
officers of the steamer when they ar
rived here from Haytl to-day and re
ported the occurrence.
None of 'the marine registers avail
able has any record of a schooner
named the G. H. S. The craft was
bound from Long Cay on the Hondu

Islands.

Bessie Mason, another maid, testified
that shortly before the accident, she
saw Miss Dolbeer sitting, on a sort of
window by the inclosure of a radiator,
on the sill of a' window. Miss Warren,
Emery said he thought July & might
bf accurately described as a "warm
day," but he was of the opinion that it
would not be accurate to call July 9
a "very hot day," and he thought the
humidity abnormal.
Jennie , O'Donnell, employed as a
maid at the Waldorf-Astoria, testified
that it was part of her duty to care
for the rooms occupied by Miss Dol
beer and Miss Warren. About 4 o'cleck
in the afternoon of July 9, 1904, she
said, Miss Warren and Miss Dolbeer
were at the windows looking from the
hall into the court. She saw them
.leave the window and go into their
rooms together. A few minutes'" later
she saw Miss Dolbeer corne out alone
and go again to the window. She did
not knew whether it was closed or
open. The witness said that as Miss
Dolbeer walked to the window, she no
ticed that Miss Warren was standing
at the door of her room looking toward
Miss Dolbeer. The witness walked
down the hall oast Miss Dolbeer and
got to the ena of the hall when she
was startled by a noise which she said
she could not describe, and heard a
woman scream. She , . turned back
quickly. Miss Dolbeer was gone and
Miss Warren was at the window wav
ing her arms and screaming. When
the witness , ran up to her and asked
what had happened. Miss Warren cried
out In anguish: "You saw me trying to
save her: she's gone out of the win
dow." ...
Mrs. McClurg, the housekeeper of
the Waldorf-Astoria ; Dr. Homer Gib
ney. Coroner Scholer and* others have

Detective Sullivan did not think the
day very warm.
Emery gave the temperatures for
the hours from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. on
the days of July 1 to July 9 inclusive
and the percentage of humidity for the
several hours on those days. He read
from the Weather Bureau records,
which, he said, had been prepared un
der his general supervision, but he
could not vouch for the accuracy of
each detail. Because of his Indirect
knowledge of the details the attorney
for the proponents had an objection
to the testimony recorded.

"I was living at the Waldorf-Astoria
at the time," said Greenwood, "and

from Miss Dolbeer asking me to take
Then Greenwood told of his meeting
with Miss Dolbeer at the Waldorf-
Astoria In New York in May, Just be
fore she sailed for Europe, and in the
hotel where two months later her life
was ended.
Deponent said that from what he
saw Miss Warren was a companion of
Miss Dolbeer and that they were "close
together." Miss Warren went with
Miss Dolbeer almost everywhere.
FINDS IIElt IX GOOD SPIRIT.
"She was never hilarious, never lively
like many other girls, but was a clever
girl and pleasing to meet on all occa
sions. She was Intelligent in every
way, had an amiable disposition, was
very considerate of others, and always
capable of taking care of herself. She
was somewhat reticent."
"I was with Miss Dolbeer a great
deal at Del Monte during that summer.
She was fond of outdoor sports and
appeared to be enjoying herself very
much."
Greenwood was asked to .tell of the
traits and characteristics of the young
heiress and he answered as follows:
"In the summer of 1903^ Miss Dolbeer
was a member of an automobile party
that made the trip from Oakland to
Monterey. The others were myself.
Miss Warren, Mr. and Mrs. Buckbee,
Miss Hager and Mr. Earl. We had
many breakdowns on the way, and,
though we left Oakland at 9 o'clock in
the morning, we did not arrive at Del
Monte till the next morning at 6
o'clock. Miss Dolbeer appeared to be
in the best cf health and endured the
trials of the trip better than any other
member of the party. She was very
composed and serene through it all.
She was a very good chauffeur, for 'she
was level-headed and cool.
Greenwood is a recently discovered
factor in the will contest instituted by
Adolph Schander and now on trial be
fore Judge Coffey and a Jury. Not un
til ' last Thursday were the attorneys
for the proponents apprised that he
could give important testimony. It
was a strange coincidence that he had
been summoned on the panel from
which the jury was selected, and sat
for two days in the courtroom waiting
to be called. But the twelve men were
accepted before his name was drawn.
Inasmuch as he had planned to leave
for New York next Thursday, it was
arranged to take his deposition. He
gave his age as 31 and residence at the
St. Francis Hotel. His answers were
as follows:
"I knew Bertha Dolbeer for about
six years before her death, and I was
also acquainted with her father. I met
her at social functions, I dined at her
house on several occasions, she was at
dinner parties at my house frequently,
and I met her in the country, princi
pally at Monterey. I met her father,
John Dolbeer, in San Francisco. I met
Miss Dolbeer and Miss Warren in New
York when they were there with Mr.
Dolbeer shortly before his death.
"About the first of February in the
present year Miss Dolbeer attended a
dinner party I gave in my apartments
on Van Ness avenue. Miss Warren
was also present. No, I cannot recall
who else was there nor any incident. 1
remember there were six or eight al
together. I think one of the party was
Mr. Follis, but I am not sure.
TKLI.S OF AUTOMOBILE TRIP.
"I never say anything that in the
slightest degree would tend to the con
clusion that she wa3' other than sane."
Frederick A. Greenwood, business
man and capitalist, prominent in so
ciety both in New York and San Fran
cisco, yesterday added his opinion to
the opinions of many others that Ber
tha M. Dolbeer was of sane and dis
posing mind when she executed her
will. His deposition was taken yester
day, and after telling how well he
knew Miss Dolbeer he spoke as fol
lows of her mental condition:
.... I . wa f detained and we did not call
till 5 o clock. We sat in the hallway
for about an hour and talked of San
I< rancisco. cf her trip abroad and other
things. There was nothing unusual
or strange about her. She appeared
lively in temperament and enthusiastic
over her trip to Europe." ,
In cross-examination Greenwood's
memory proved at fault as to details.
Attorney Johnson drew out the fact
that deponent had dined only once at
Miss Dolbeer's home after the death
of her father, which occurred in 1902
The attorney also laid stress on the in
ability of Greenwood to recall any
other names but those of Miss Dolbeer
and Miss Warren as being present at
the dinner party in his apartments.
The trial of the contest will be re
sumed Monday morning In Judge Cof
fey's court.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 11. â General
J. F. Wade, commander of the Phil
ippine division of the army, in lus an
nual report, says cholera has disap
peared from the islands. He says that
while the troops in the islands ha.v2
not been actively engaged, their pres
ence there is necessary' as an aid to
the civil officers. Continuing, General
Wade says:
"The Filipino soldier, both scojt
and constabulary, has done and is do
ing good work, but it is the work cf
thf- trained soldier against the mob.
He has been well armed, drilled and
tl scip'ired by American officers and
led by these officers against the unJ's
ci;Â»).'ned, undrilled and poorly armed
outlaws of the provinces; m^n of his
( avii race, but lacking his advantages
and having nothing to gain arid till to
lose by fighting. The talk of the Fil
ipino soldier has gone so far that
many persons have . evolved theories
for a continental army to be composed
in whole or In part of natives.
"In fact, to judge by what one sees
and hears, most army officers and
many civilians seem to keep bills for
this purpose in stock, fully developed
and ready to be drawn up in the form
of an act of Congress. In one re
spect" too many of these schemes re
semble the numerous projects for a
Filipino republic, which provide by
name for a dictator and a lieutenant
general."
The general adds that it is to be
hoped that within a reasonable period
conditions will have improved suf
ficiently to enable the constabulary to
keep the peace throughout the islands
and "that then the borrowed troops
can be returned and by order of the
President the number of companies re
duced."
-In his opinion the time has not ar
rived when an arrangement can be
made for the proper garrisoning of the
islands. The actual value of the Fili
pino as a regular soldier, he says, is
still an open question, adding: "His
staying powers when brought against
a force equal or superior in number,
drill and arms; his loyalty to those
who employ him, and many other
questions of vital importance, have
not. been decided. He has to some ex
tent been a pupil of the American sol
dier, but is far from being a grad
uate."

recognizing the desirability of having
some of the Government yards equip
ped for building naval vessels of the
largest size. Rear Admiral W. L.
Capps, Chief Constructor of the Navy,
In his annual report published at the
Navy Department to-day, says that
"the repairing and overhauling of the

portant work of navy yards and in
time of war their resources will be tax
ed to the utmost in performing such
work.". . ,- Â¦ V
Of the work on the battleship Con
necticut, building at the New York
yard, the chief constructor says that
despite every effort to reduce the cost of
this, the first battleship to be construct
ed in a navy yard, to the most eco
nomical basis, "it can hardly be hoped
that the work will be done as cheaply
as when performed in private ship
building yards, whose rates of pay for
nine hours' work, in many cases, are
less than those being paid for eight
hours' work at the navy yards in New
York. It may also be noted that pri
vate shipyards do not pay their per

To-day R. H. Quincy filed a petition
with City Clerk Walter, asking for a
franchise for a broad gauge electric
railway along Twelfth street, from the
northern city limits to Empire, to
Vine street and out Vine to the west

asked for a line from Third and

limits. The first mentioned line
traverses almost the center of the city.
Quincy built the Alum Rock motor

"Yes, that is the scoundrel. He was

He is the man who led my boy Into
stealing and breaking into houses. I
know him well, for he was at our house
many times, and I never knew what ho
was teaching my son until that awful
thing happened at Oakland. I hope to
live to the day when he is hanged and
I would like to witness his execution."
Kiniry could not speak for a time,
but he finally managed to say, vi
ciously:
"Well, If you are anxious to see ma
hanged I hope you will come up when
the execution takes place." He then
turned his face to the wall and cov

remained until Mrs. Goldstein had left

GLENS FALLS, N. T., Nov. 1LâEu
gene L. Ashley, confidential friend and
legal adviser of the late William
Moore, an Adirondack lumber man, to
day furnished further Information re
garding the Van Rensselaer estate,
disposed of by Moore in his will. '
At a hearing before a surrogate,
Ashley said that Moore had told him
that the will of William Van Rens
selaer, who, he s3ld, was his father,
was probated in Massachusetts and in
California and that the bulk of, the
estate was in Boston, Albany and San
Francisco. Moore had said that the life
tenant, who was a second wife of Van
Rensselaer, lived in Los Angeles before
1894; that just prior to 1894 she spent
several seasons at Saratoga and while
there she sent for Moore and had a
conference with him, at which her
California attorneys were present.
At that time, Moore said, he was of
fered $500,000 if he would forfeit his
claims to the estate. Moore said that
he told the tenant that he had worked
too long to find out who he was, and
that he could not be bought off for half
a million, and that he proposed to clear
up the cloud on his name.
During the time that Ashley was ad
vising Moore, he wrote a letter to Mrs.
Van Rensselaer, at Moore's dictation.
The letter was produced. It said in
conclusion:
One report from the posse to-day
states that Ed Jackson was chased
into a cave last night, when it was de
cided to wait for daylight for his cap
ture. Although the place was sur
rounded during the night, Jackson
escaped. The posse has been increased
to 350. Meantime friends of Jack
son are reported to be openly organiz
ing around Montgomery and swearing
vengeance if Jackson is lynched or
killed without a trial.
A posse, headed by Marshal Harri
son B. Ash of Thurmond is scouring
the mountains near Montgomery. Two
bloodhounds have been placed on the
trail. The officials in Montgomery fear
further trouble, as sentiment against
the slayer of Daniels is very strong.
Most of the Jackson followers have
escaped to the mountain strongholds,
with whltfh they are familiar. Ernest
and Bob Jackson, however, were ar
rested- and brought to this . city by
Deputy Sheriff Davis and others. They
are jailed here.
CHARLESTON, W. Va., Nov. 11.â
As the result of the killing of Con
stable' Walter Jackson In Montgom
ery by. Policeman Elliott on Wednes
day and the subsequent capture ofr the
town by the four brothers of Jackson
at the head of about forty of their
friends, a reign of terror exists there.
The Mayor, being: helpless, appealed
to Sheriff Daniels yesterday. When
Sheriff Daniels and John Rolf wers
killed b\ Ed Jackson yesterday the
saloons were at once closed and Gov
ernor White was asked to send troops.
The Governor replied he would hold

RENO, Nov. 11.â Clad only in a suit
of underclothing A. Frakes, a miner
on his way to Goldfleld, walked
through the streets of Reno to-day,
followed by a howling mob. He looked
neither to the right nor to the left,
but continued to the police station
and requested the Chief of Police to
give him a pair of trousers, saying
that his clothes had been stolen while
he was asleep.
After purchasing a new suit of
clothes, a pair of miner's brogans and
some new underwear, Frakes went to
the depot on Thursday night and fell
asleep. Some time during the night
tramps entered the place, and, with
out awakening the tired miner, re
moved his trousers and shirt and
picking up his coat and vest, which he
had taken off. made their way from
the room. ThU .miner slept on until
he was thrown into the street by the
night watchman. Finding himself
nearly nude, he quickly made his way
.to the police station and requested
that his clothes be found. The officers
were unable to find his apparel, but
found his friends, who furnished him
with a new outfit and sent him on to
Goldfield.

Both Democratic and Republican

hundreds of ballots have been held up
by the supervisors in Baltimore and
in at least three counties. It will there
fore require the decision of the State
Board of Canvassers to determine the

The unofficial returns received thus
far indicate ' that seven Democratic
electors and one Republican elector
was. chosen. The Congressional situa
tion remains unchanged, three Demo
cratic and three Republican Congress
men having been elected.
Of the Presidential electors it Is
safe to say that by the count C. J.

was elected, and the remaining seven
Maryland members of the electoral

jority of 400 for the Democrats.

The commissioners have provided a re

Mr. Lloyd moved that a new pipe

west of Strawberry Hill, where a reser-'
volr will be constructed. The water
will be needed for the new half-mile
track. One mile of pipe will be re
quired and advertisements for bids
were ordered. The expense for pipe
will be about $500.
The Association for the Improvement
and Adornment of San Francisco re
quested that Park Superintendent Mc-
Laren furnish loam and slips of plants
for window flower boxes that people
have been asked to place In the win
dows of their homes. President Spreck
els reminded the board that there had
already been set aside enough boxes
of plants for the city schools and that
the commission had its hands full. The
board then decided that it would not be
practical for It to assume the extra
expense of providing thousands of slips
and the necessary loam to citizens.

Mr. Lloyd then moved that the City
Engineer give the exact lines, partic
ularly at the north end of the road,
and when it was ascertained just
where the lines are the building of the
wall shall proceed. The motion also
included the giving of specific author
ity to the Supervisors to proceed with
the work. Carried.
A communication was read from
Chairman James D. Phelan of the Mc-
Kinley monument committee Inviting
the Park Commissioners to take an ac
tive part in the ceremony of receiving
the monument on behalf of the city on
the 24th of the present month. Mr.
Lloyd moved that President Spreckels
be appointed to receive the monument
on behalf ut the Park Commissioners.
Mr. Spreckels suggested that Mr. Sulli
van do the honors for me commission,
but as Mr. Lloyd insisted that his mo
tion prevail it was decided that Use

be engaged for the occasion.
Mr. Brandenstein said that City En
gineer Woodward intended to make
use of the surplus cash, over the cost
of the parapet, to build a. nine-foot
sidewalk along the line of the wall.
The parapet will be three and a half
feet high and constructed of natural
rock.
A question arose as to the survey of
the lands owned by the- city, and Mr.
Lloyd said he thought that some of
the property that should be within the
city lines was being used by persons
who had no. right to occupy it. He ad
vised that the City Engineer run the
lines again. President Spreckels added
that when this was done he did not
think there would be any objection to
going ahead with the wall.
NEW SURVEY WANTED.
Mr. Sullivan said that he hoped
that the gift would be followed by
other generous donations by public
spirited citizens.
Supervisor Brandensteln, on behalf
of the Board of Supervisors, appeared
before the board with plans for the
proposed new parapet at the edge of
the road that leads from the Cliff
House to the beach. Mr. Brandenstein
explained that the Supervisors had ap
propriated nearly $5000 for the im
provement, and all that was desired
was the sanction of the Park Commis
sioners.
Improvement of park properties, in
cluding a stone parapet for the Cllflf
road and the routine business were
discussed yesterday afternoon by the
Park Commissioners in the office of
President Adolph Spreckels. 327 Mar
ket street. There were present Com
missioners Spreckels, Sullivan, Lloyd
and Dingee. Mr. Sullivan was compell
ed to leave shortly after the meeting
was called to order, but he remained
long enough to say that he favored an
investigation of the bids submitted
last .week for the privilege of publish
ing the Park News, the official park
programme. He thought that as
Quirk &â¢ Co. and Phillips, Smyth &
Van Orden, bidders, were very close
to each other in a business way there
might be collusion. However, as Quirk
Ac Co.'s bid meant a substantial sum
for the treasury of the commission in
excess of any that other firms offered,
President Spreckels did not see tho
necessity of allowing the contract to
remain unindorsed. It was finally
igreed that the matter should go over
until the next meeting of the board,
when it will bo decided what disposi
tion shall be made of the privilege.
Captain James McDonald, through
the board, made a generous offer to
the city. Captain McDonald says that
he wants to present the city with an
improved public convenience station
for the park at Filbert and Stockton
streets. Captain McDonald said that
all that he desired the Commissioners
to do was to stand the expense for
grading and piping. â¢ The offer was ac
cepted.

As in the case with gold and other

hardly been tilled. No one doubts
that from quartz ledges, placers,

This being a time of careful Invest
ment in mines by conservative capi
talists, nothing can be of more value to
this State than to have its varied min
ing resources carefully described and
set out with the approval of the Cali
fornia State Mineralogist. Maps and
registers, are valuable in this connec
tion as affording needed and reason
ably exact Information about mineral
deposits, the condition of mines as re
gards development, the values of out
putn by counties of various substances
and other facts that men of money
must first ascertain as conditions.pre
cedent to sending Into the State the
money that Is needed for development
purposes.
Cement was produced last year in
counties as far removed from one an
other as Solano, Los Angeles, San
Bernardino and Napa. The output
of these four counties was 640,
868 barrels of the total value of
nearly $1,000,000, the exact figures be
ing $958,727. Brick clays were produced
In Alameda, Butte, Contra Costa,
Fresno, Humboldt, Kern, Kings, Los
Angeles, Madera, Marin, Mendocino,
Orange, Riverside, Sacramento, San
Bernardino. San Diego, San Francisco,
San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa
Barbara, Santa Clara, Shasta, Sonoma,
Tehama, Tulare and Ventura counties,
and the aggregate output of these
counties in this direction was worth
$1,999,546. Pottery clay was produced
to the value of $99,907 In Amador, Los
Angeles, Placer and Riverside counties.
Glass sand is found in Los Angeles and
Monterey counties. The granite pro
duct quarried in Fresno, Madera, Ne
vada, Placer, Riverside, Sacramento,
San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa
Cruz, Solano, Trinity, Tulare and Tuo
lumne counties made a' total showing
of $687,670 in 1903.
The lime output of California In 1903
was valued by the State Mineralogist
at $418,280, and the limestone that was
quarried was worth $163,988. Amador,
Inyo, Riverside, San Bernardino and
Tuolumne counties have an annual
output of marble amounting to $100,000
in round figures. Sandstone is pro
duced in Colusa, Los Angeles, San Luis
Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara.
Ventura and Yolo counties. The total
value of sandstone quarried last year
in the counties that have been men
tioned . was reported officially to be
$585,309. The slate output' of a year
that was marketed 'brought $70,000. The
total for these few commodities alone
that have' been mentioned in the fore
going for one year was $4,992,252 in
value.
FIELD ONLY SCRATCHED.
A systematic Investigation of the
building materials of California is in
progress under the direction of State
Mineralogist Aubury." The work was
begun in Alameda County, where Mr.
Narramore was engaged in making a
search for deposits of substances used
in building. It will now be continued
In many " counties. Heretofore some
thing has been done in this direction.
Large deposits of various substances
of the non-metallic sort have been de
scribed and statistically estimated, but
there has been no general search over
the entire field for materials that may
be used in building.
The State Mineralogist believes that
many deposits of great value may be
discovered. Not long ago the slate In
dustry of California was quite small.
The cement industry is of more recent
date, but a fine record has been made.
It has been discovered that in a large
coal deposit in Alameda County, at
Tesla, there are overlying clays that
make excellent bricks. Several coun
ties produce marble. El Dorado County
can supply slate in almost unlimited
quantities. Folsom granite haÂ« a name
all over the coast. Colusa County
Santa Barbara County and several
other counties have large deposits of
fine building stone.

William Rogers was sentenced to five
months" Imprisonment after Judge Ca
banlss became convinced that he had
Btolen Nels Hagenson's watch, as
charged. Nels lives at Belvedere and
he was spending the night with Mr.
Rogers, at the latter's home In this
city, when the robbery was perpe
tiattd.
So thick and long was the mustache
of Neil Smith, accused of vagrancy,
that it made his speech unintelligible
when he endeavored to plead not
guilty before Judge Fritz. His words
seemed to be Jumbled and his tone wag
rumbling as he tried to filter his plea
through the bushy lip adornment. He
was given thirty days and advised to
eh-ear his face.
After the hearing had been ordered
continued till to-day, Miss Hill swore
to a complaint charging the alleged
recreant Tomaso with vagrancy. The

Miss Aileone Hill, self-alleged actress,

dss, hoped the court would overlook
,eny inaccuracies of grammer or pro
nunciation that might crop out of her
testimony, as she was so embarrassed
by her unfortunate situation that fhe
might Inadvertently drop into collo
quialisms incompatible with the dlg
.nity of the tribunal. However, if the
lawyers for the prosecution would re
frain from further ilustering of her
confused faculties, she might succeed
%n unfolding a coherent narrative
couched in language that would re
Â¦fk-et no discredit upon her education
for the dramatic stage. That was to
Â¦say. If the bench would protect her
from unnecessary interruptions by
counsel the could sidestep slang and
Â¦keep her tenses unmixed. Correctness
of reading was not the least valuable
of her histrionic charms, and 6he re
erectfully depended upon the court to
prevent anything that might tend to
impair her professional worth.
i To which his Honor. Judge Mogan,
responded that due allowance would
i>e made for the intellectual confusion
confessed by th<Â» defendant, and that
Jdlt questioning from the attorneys'
table would not be permitted to inten
sify it. At the saxne time, however, he
trusted that the "lady" would devote
as much tare to the truthfulness of her
tale as to the manner of telling it. In
other words, her testimony could not be
too heavily hampered by facts.
Thus tlven ciear headway. Miss Hill
proceeded to narrate the Incident of the
ring. Phe did not steal the trinket, but
borrowed it from Komeo, and when
Tcmaso saw it on her finger he became
obsessed of jealous anser. took it away
from her and then declared he had
never seen it. Very deliberately was
her defense unroiled. and more than
cr.ee she corrected an improper word
or phrase which inadvertently slipped
from her tongue. The recording clerk
courteously amended his notes to con
form to her desire to be literally
Quoted. She expressed hope that the
court would excuse her allusions to
Tomaso as "Harry," which was her
pet name for him, and she almost
blushed with vexation when one of the
attorneys forced her to confess that In
her tete-a-tetes with Romeo she ad
dressed him as "Romey."

Aftre feloniously taking a $100
horse from the barn of F. Depaoli at
721 Filbert street, Albert Giannottl
steered the animal to the barn of Wil
liam Clough at Fourteenth and Shot
well streets and offered to sell it for
$30 cash. The cheapness of the pro
posal made Mr. Clough suspicious and
he quietly telephoned his suspicion to
the Seventeenth-street police station,
where a description of the missing
Â«*o.uine had just been filed by Its owner.
That's how Mr. Giannottl came to be
arrested and charged with srrand lar
ceny. Judge Fritz has continued the
case till next Monday.
Miss Lucille Adams said she thought
she recognized an "old towney" In the
person of Roundsman H. M. Smith
when he entered her home In the first
block of Eddy street. He was in plain
attire and when she began question-
Ing him as to why and when he left
dear old Egypt, 111., and informed him
that he appeared but little older than
he did when she started West, he did
not attempt disillusion, but cor
dially Invited her to drink at his ex
pense. No sooner had she filled the
glasses and pocketed the money ten
dered by him in payment for their
contents than he placed her under ar
rest for selling liquor without a li
cense. To nay that she was dum

her feelings when he disclosed his
Identity. Of course, she would not

never did In her life before â If shÂ© had
not firmly believed that he was from

of Miss Adams' plea on November 21.
J. Siki, a Japanese, smaller In stature
than the average of his race, was so
chagrined by the report that the
Mikado had sued for peace with the

ostensibly endeavoring to restrain the
little man, ran away when the police

Frederick Bridge made his twen
tieth appearance in the Police Court
on the charge of vagrancy and Judge
Megan intimated intention of sending
him to prison for six months. The
man's relatives, old and respected resi
dents of San Francisco, requested his
arrest and suggested the punishment.
He is a hopeless dipsomaniac.
Fred C. Groth, who described him
self as a business agent of the Gas
Workers' Union, was dismissed by
Judge Fritz because the policeman
who charged him with peace disturb
ance failed to appear to prosecute. Mr.
Groth explained that he and a friend
went into a Grant-avenue restaurant
on election night and were attacked
by a dog and that their resistance of
the canine attack was the cause of
their arrest. The dog waa a total
stranger to him, Mr. Groth averred,
and. without any provocation whatso
ever, endeavored to bite away a por
tion of one of his (Mr. G.'s) friend's
legs.
Solly Jacobs, who accused Ike Wolf
of battery at 330 Fell street, was on tte
witness stand when Judge Mogan ad
journed court and remained there till
long after his Honor had departed
from the Hall of Justice. Before or
dering adjournment the Judge contin
ued the case till to-day and told Mr.
Jacobs that he might retire, but the
latter's wife commanded him to re

was obeyed. Again the Judge inform
ed him that he was at liberty to step
down, and Mr. Jacobs replied that his
wife told him to stay there. So there
the Judge left him.

in the Richmond District. He was
cross-eyed as he faced the bench, but

the Judge continued it till he has more

The Judge expressed his disapproval
of Mr. Hoadley's sense of humor by
imposing a fine of $15, itnd no sooner
w ere th Â» words uttered than a buxom
and fashionably appareled negress ad

REBSTOCK ARRAIGNED FOR
VIOLATING ELECTION' LAW
Justice of the Peace Golden yester
day gave Judgment for 55 and $5 65
cost In favor of H. A. Krouse, who
sued the Pacific States Telephone
Company for $150 damages for having
taken out a telephone in his office.
The testimony disclosed that the com
pany took the phone out because
KrouEe refused to pay a bill of $9 2o.
The company afterward placed an
other phone in Krouse's office for a
concern called the Sentinels of the
Universe, but took it out again when
it ascertained that Krouse was the real
patron. Golden held that the com
pany had waived its right in the prem
ises but decided that Krouse did not
prove conclusively that he had been
damaged to the extent of SloO.

The headquarters of the American j
Federation of Labor at the Russ
House took on an appearance of ac- i
tivity yesterday that is a forerunner of
the importance and bustle of the com
ing two weeks' convention. Several
representatives arrived from distant
points and registered in the headquar
ters book, while others are due to-day.
The executive council of the Federa
tion will arrive Sunday evening, and
the business of the convention will be
(in Monday morning.
Prominent among those who rank â¢
with the leaders in the advancement
of organized labor is the dainty and j
winning national organizer, Miss j
Emma Lanphere. She has devoted the
greater portion of an active and use
ful life to the uplifting and bettering
of her co-workers, the retail clerks.
Her work has been the result- of study
of and sympathy with their conditions
throughout the United States.
Miss Lanphere was born in Chicago,
Illinois, and at the age of fifteen be
came a clerk. Soon afterward, seeing
the opportunity to better the conditions
of the thousands of workers, she felt
it her duty to devote her life to the
task. In the last five years Miss Lan
phere has visited every city of im^
portance In the United States, every- |
where organizing the retail clerks and
preaching the doctrine of advancement
and betterment.
Miss Lanphere will be In the city dur
ing the convention and from -time to
time will address the different branches j
of organized labor at the several halls. (
The first meeting will take place Mon- j
day night, when the fair young worker 1
will address a gathering of the Retail
Clerks' International Protective Asso- â¢
elation at Pioneer Hall. The other
speakers will be Samuel Gompers, John
R. O'Brien and Max Morris.. On
Wednesday night a reception and ball
will be given by the retail clerks at
Golden Gate Hall to the national of
ficers and delegates.
CHICAGO WELL REPRESENTED.
William G. Shardt, president of the
Chicago Federation of Labor, com- !
prising 250,000 laboring men of Cook j
County, lllnois, and president of the j

look of the convention, and declared
that the labor movement has never be
fore been in so strong a posl.tlon as at
the present time. .
As to the introduction of Socialism ,
into the policy of the American Fed- j
eration, Mr. Schardt expressed himself |
as opposed to the plan. He said the j
Federation should keep clear of all,
political entanglements and predicted j
that the Socialist delegates would be 1
"turned down" in quicker time here i
than In the convention last year In '
Boston, where the delegates were di- '
vided on other questions. The Socialist j
delegates to the convention are Max ',
Hays of Cleveland, Ohio, and Slayton [
of Newcastle, Pa. ; i
Other arrivals at headquarters yes- !

t
CHICAGO. Nov. 11. â Formal notice
that the charter of the Chicago Fed
eration of Labor has been revoked and
that the organization was expelled
from the American Federation of La
bor was given to-day to Secretary E.
N. Xuckels by telegraph. The tele
gram was signed by President Samuel
Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor and was dated at Denver,
where the members of the executive
council of the American Federation
made a stop on their way to San Fran
cisco. The telegram received by Sec
retary Nuckels read:
"Your central body failed to com
ply with the executive council's direc
tions as decided by the Boston con
vention and contained in my letter of
September 2 8. Time limit. November
1, having expired, your charter stands
revoked. Executive council has fur
ther decided charter will be restored

with decision."
To comply with the instructions of
the executive council the Chicago Fed
eration will be compelled to expel
from membership the local unions of
steams fitters and Franklin Union No.
4 of Press Feeders. The pressmen
claim jurisdiction over the press feed
ers and the plumbers over the steam
fitters. It was at the instance of these
two organizations that the Chicago
Federation of Labor was expelled from
membership in the national body.

NEW TOKK, Nov. U. â Dun's week
Â«Jy review of trade will say to -morrow:
All measures of trade indicated the
custoirary less due to holiday inter
ruption, but consequently much of the
deficit was regained, numerous evi
dences of increasing confidence being
seen in the disposition to place orders
for distant shipments. Increased con
sumption of pig iron is also significant
and In other leading branches of man
ufacture there is a steadily diminish
inc percentage of idle machinery.
Woolen mills are busy despite the
fact that it is between seasons and the
raw wool market is very strong.
Foreign commerce at this port for the
last week shows a decrease of $562,&05
la exports, compared with last year's
lig-ures. while imports increased $4,347,
i*l. Receipts of coffee were a prom
inent factor in this grain.
Railway earnings in October exceed
ed last year's by 3.S per cent-
Hides are on a firmer basis, with
Frocks limited and offerings emalL For
eign dry hides have sold at a further
fractional advance.
Failures this week numbered 213 in
the United States, against 2S3 last year.
ar.d IT in Canada, compared with 27 a
year ago.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say: In
terest in the elections and unseason
able warm weather in some sections
have retarded trade, but the more op
timistic outiook as to the future found
reflection later in enlargement of
Â¦wholesale and Jobbing business, a
Snuf-r tone of prices and more as
fured activity in many leading indus
tries. Official reports of past crop
yields and advices of largely increased
acreage of fall-sown crops were con
tributors to the confident feeling. In
addition, reports as to the outlook for
holiday ar.d next spring's trade have
proved favdrable.
Relatively the best reports as to
trade and collections have come from
th<=- South, but leading Western cen
ters have reported improvement in re
order business and there is rather more
snap to demand in the East from job
bers ar.fi first-hands. Collections have
b*en rather better and money easy.
Railway earnings returns point to
moderate gains over the good results
of last fail and point to a better dis
tribution of the enlarged business here
tofore noted by the railways. Prices
testify to demand pressing upon supply
in a "general level of quotations close
to the highest record in the past de
cade.
Metals are strong, copper especially
f\ and something like a scramble for
this metal is reported, even at the ad
vance of 14 cents.

ARRANGING FOR GREAT
RELIGIOUS CONVENTION
Captain Frank Nichols of Truck 4
was before the Commissioners, charged
with failure to pay a grocery bill. He
was informed that he would be sus
pended until he settled with his credi
tor. Through the mediation of' a
money broker a satisfactory settle
ment was made in less than ten min
utes. Commissioner Parry remarked
at the time that members of the de
partment must pay their bills for fam
ily supplies or leave the service.
The bid of the Bay Shore Water
Company to place six hydrants in the
Re is tract, near the San Bruno road,
at the rate charged by the Spring Val
ley Company, was acted upon favor
ably.
John Loftus of Engine 35 was repri
manded. He explained that he had
been out all night at a wake and when
he reported on for duty in the morn
ing considered himself sober. His su
perior officers held a different opinion
and suspended him. He will be per
mitted to resume work, but was ad
vised to keep away from wakes in the
future unless he had a long leave of
absence in which to sober up.
As a result of the recent opinion of
the City Attorney that members of the
Fire Department are entitled to pay
while disabled on duty, even if the in
jury was not incurred during the per
formance of such duty, the Fire Com
missioners yesterday afternoon decided
to withdraw six men who have been
stationed in theaters. The funds of
the department are running low and
many men are now on the disabled
list. As they must be paid in full
and salaries also awarded to their sub
stitutes, the Commissioners decided to
withdraw the firemen stationed at the
Unique, the Broadway, the Cineo
graph, the Empire, the Novelty and
the Midway. The smaller show houses
were chosen as there is less danger of
panic and some of them are liable to
be closed at any time for failure to
comply with regulations regarding
exits.

, Farrell was one of the best known
railroad men in the West, and his
death creates a vacancy that will be
hard to OIL His ability as a railroad
operator began to attract attention
about fifteen years ago, while he was
superintendent of the Chicago division
of the Chicago and Great Western
road. In 1S90 he went to the Great
Northern as general superintendent of
its Western division, and was with
that roÂ»d .when it passed through the
Cascades'. Later he retired from the
railroad business and engaged in min
ing in British Columbia, He. had not
been long out of active service when
lie received an offer from the New
York people in control of the Pacific
Coast Company, which owns the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company, to ac
cept the presidency of the holding cor
poration.
A year ago last January Farrell re
signed his position with the Paclflc
Coast Company to accept from J. J.
Kill the presidency of the Great North
ern Steamship Company, and accom
panying this announcement was an
other that Farrell had been appointed
assistant to thÂ« president of the Great
Northern Railroad, of which Hill Is
the head. Immediately after joining
the Hill forces Farrell went to the
Orient for the purpose of arranging
agencies there for the Hill, steamship
line and effecting traffic alliances with
large Japanese and Chinese concerns.
Farrell was about 52 years of age
and is survived by a widow and one
child. :'.
SEATTLE, Nov. 11.â T. C. Farrell,
assistant to the president of the Great
Northern Railroad and president of
the Great Northern Steamship Com
pany, died here to-day of blood poison
ing after a two months' illness. He had
resided in Seattle for two years, com
ing here from North Dakota. Mr. Far
rell will be buried at Elkton, N. Dak.

Times, and during that time did much
to shape the destiny of his State.
His first entry into Kansas was in
1854. when he led a Free State party
to the Sunflower State. Soon there
after he became connected with news
paper -work and up to the time of his
death he was active In the affairs of
the State. He had served both as
Mayor and postmaster of Leaven
worth, as a member of the Kansas
Legislature and in 1886 he was made
a Government director of the Union
Pacific Railroad.
The Supreme Court, after reviewing
the statutory provision providing for
the calling of elections, says: "We are
of the opinion that under this provision
of the Constitution the defendants
(Supervisors) are invested with full
discretion to order a special election,
or, if they deem that course inadvisa
ble, to wait until the next general elec
tion to submit the proposed amend
ments to a vote of the people."
The decision is final and no further
action in the matter can be taken by
any authority other than that of the
Board of Supervisors.
There will be no special election on
the proposed amendments .to the char
ter; this "year at least. The Supervisors
have refused to take any action in the
matter, and yesterday the Supreme
Court upheld their decision. The
propositions will probably be presented
to the people at the election to be held
next November, but the vote cannot be
ratified by the Legislature until Janu
ary, 1907. The case was brought to the
official attention of the Supreme Court
by the Board of Education. Morris
Lubiner, as a taxpayer, petitioned the
Justices for a writ of mandate com
pelling the Board of Supervisors to or
der a special election on proposed
amendments to the charter. An at
tempt was made to show that the law
made it mandatory upon the city's
legislators to call an election after they
had formally decided to do so.
The Election Commissioners declined
to place the propositions on the of
ficial ballot for the general election of
last Tuesday and the Supreme Court
sustained them. Then a special elec
tion was demanded, but the Board of
Supervisors refused to take action on
the ground that there was a lack of
funds.
Although the fate of the proposed
constitutional amendment extending
the sessions of the Legislature is In
doubt, there is already considerable ac
tivity among those that will constitute
the body, the offices of president pro
tem. of the Senate and speaker of the
House being largely in demand. The
latest aspirant for the office of speaker
of the House is T. E. Atkinson, who
was elected" in the Thirty-ninth District
after a bitter fight against an indepen
dent candidate. Atkinson's friends say
he is sure of the support of the entire
San Francisco delegation and will
make a hard fight for the place. This
is Atkinson's first term, however, and
it is pointed out by party leaders that
his associates are likely to make this
a ground for opposing his candidacy.
The Republican County Committee,
which for several years has maintained
headquarters at 16 Geary street, is
searching for new. apartments. The
building at 16 Geary street is to be
torn down in a few weeks to make
place for a twelve-story_structure, and
the county committee v has been ordered
to vacate. A sub-committee is looking
for suitable rooms that do not come
too high.
San Francisco will ring soon again
with the cheers of the hosts that car
ried the Republican ticket to victory
in the recent election. A grand ratifi
cation meeting is in course of prepar
ation by the Union League Club and
It will accentuate the triumph of Tues
day In a fitting manner.
As yet no date has been set for the
ratification, but ideas are being devel
oped that promise to make the occasion
a memorable one. The flambeau clubs
and the uniformed legions of tlie party
will form a parade that will lead the
way to seme large hall, where the par
ty's history will be told again, and
promises for a brighter future renewed.
What par: the State and county or
ganizations will take in the affair ; s
yet to be decided, but it is known that
they will lend their fullest co-opera
tion. - f -'^:

nesday and Is at Portland, Ore., so far
as is known. His father's sudden death
was the reason he departed soon after
the resignation was given. Hamerton
remained in Oakland and has publicly
asserted that he purposes to stay here
and fight it out. He has declared ve
hemently his innocence of; wrong-doing
and has asserted that he^ was coerced
into confession* and resignation.. . Like
wise . does Hamerton intimate that he
knows a thing or two about crooked
work in the Police Department, that
might add . an interesting chapter to
this tale of thievery and disgrace.
The Police Commissioners .filled the
vacancies caused by the dismissals to
day by. appointing Charles E. Ford J.
A. Gunter, H. N. McCready and W. J.
Tobin to be regular policemen. The
first two had been acting regulars and
the others were the last on the eligi
ble list. Examination of candidates for
appointment was set. for November 24
at 9 o'clock. Applicants for the exam
ination will be given papers at the of
fice of the board at the City Hall.

of the police was turned over to Pros

It has come to -my- knowledge to-day that
these pllferingg have- been going on .for tf-v
eral years. - The . more I see of thle disgrace
ful affair .the more I am shocked. As a citi
zen and .as a member of the Board of Police
and Fire Commissioners I purpose " to - ferret
out the whole thing, and so far as I> am con
cerned not a man shall escape' the disgrace
that he has Justly earned ' if ' he * be found
guilty.
Commissioner Turner was- of the
same opinion as the president of the
board. Mayor Olney gave assurance
that the administration would not rest
until the air had been cleared.
Amazing as wer^e yesterday's devel
opments they were paralleled to-day,
when It became known that Chief
Hodgkins had at least one definite and
specific case to fasten upon two of the
1 speak for the board when I cay that we
fully appreciate the enormity of this state Ot
affaire'. That these men, and perhaps others,
should have stooped to such petty stealings,
shielded as they were by the uniforms of their
positions, . as sworn guardians of life and
property, is simply beyond comment. My mind
is fully mads . up that thera is no halfway
course to be taken. If thesa men are guilty,
and we have their confecsions, some ' written,
some verbal, . they should bÂ« treated as .des
perate criminals. Indeed, they are worse 'than
common thjeves. A thief in his professional
career" will often times ' take a chance. Pro
tected by their uniforms these men did not
have to take a chance. -There was hardly any
danger of detection. Fortunate circumstances,

munications on the stationery of Chief
Hodekins' office, "the resignations, as
handed to me by the Chief of Police, of
Patrolmen J. F. Stahl, C. W. Hamer

Police C. E. Clark. These resignations
are before the board for action. What
is your pleasure?"
"I move that the resignations be not

"Second the motion," added Commis

The vote was unanimous in favor of
the motion. â¢
"I move that the men be summarily

Mayor Olney.
"Dishonorably," suggested Commis

"No, I think it should stand, 'eum

"All right, I second the motion," ac

The motion prevailed again by unan

Without comment, after a short exec
utive session to-day the Board of Com
missioners swept aside the profered
rertgnations of the men who stand
accused of using their positions to
plunder those whom they were paid to
protect. The Board of Police Commis
sioners quickly decided that a tenient
course of permitting resignations was
inimical to the public welfare and the
good of the Police Department.
The board met in operr session at 4
o'clock, after bearing the statements of

there will be a complete^ overhauling

In compliance with this order. Chief
Hodgkins made a search that failed of
its purpose. Neither Andrews nor
Clark could be found. Hamerton was
not arrested during the daytime, al
though he was seen this morning on
Broadway.
Further than that. John E. McEIroy
president of the board, directed Chief
Hodgkins to take into custody each one
of the accused.
OAKLAND, Nov. 11.â The Oakland
Police Department scandal has stirred
the city to the depths. .To-day the
wretched thing broke through the wall
of convenient resignations built up to
shield four members of the force who
are self-confessed thieves, according to
the evidence in the hands of Chief of
Police Hodgkins. The Board of Police
and Fire Commissioners refused to-day
to accept the resignations of- Sergeant
of Police Charles E. Clark and Patrol
men Lee E. Andrews, J. F. Stahl and
Charles W. Hamerton. By unanimous
vote the Commissioners summarily
dismissed the quartet from the force
and ordered Chief of Police Hodgkins
to turn over to Prosecuting Attorney
A. P. Leach all of the evidence against
the men, that steps may be taken to
prosecute all of them on criminal
charges.
The absence of Clark and Andrews
Is explained ' by their; friends on "the
score of a desire to go Into hiding tem
porarily, pending developments. Chief
Hodgkins thinks he is-ln^ a position to
lay his * hands on ' the men when â¢ he
That Andrews,, Clark, Stahl and
Hamerton had at times operated either
in pairs or even all together during the
period covered by their confessions- is
the belief of police officials. That they
had some agreement as to the. tempor
ary disposal of the property taken is
also thought to be a fact. As the
depths are sounded confirmations are
reached in . number. Among the dis
closures to-day was that supplied by
Charles Gilbert, Janitor of the Physi
cians' building on . Washington, near
Thirteenth street, where Clark and An
drews said they had carried on a "beer
bust" with women. They asserted
yesterday that j Hamerton had been in
the connivial party. This Hamerton
denies and Hodgkins says Hamerton
was not there. But Gilbert and a Mrs.
Miles,;- who works for Gilbert, . cor
roborate the statement that two police
men did carouse in the building with
one Jennie Cook, who had also worked
for Gilbert Another former employe
in the buirding said he had seen a big,
fat policeman carry off a big package
of groceries that had been hidden be
hind a doorway In the entrance.
JIEN I\ IIIDIXG.
Included in the list of stores are the
Eastern Outfitting Company, Thir
teenth and Clay streets; H. D. Gush
ing's, Smith Brothers stationery and
book store, Crescent Cors'et Company
and a cloak establishment at Tenth
and Clay streets.
Not a little of the evidence which
Chief Hodsrklns laid before the Police
Commissioners to-day was contained
in two written confessions of guilt,
one of which was made by Stahl and
the other by Andrews. The verbal ad
missions made by Clark and Hamerton
were repeated by Ilodgkins, Captain
Peterson and Captain Wilson, before
whom all four men were questioned" on
election day.
The contents of the written confes
sions as well as the details of the oral
statements are being closely guarded
pending such time as Prosecuting At
torney Leach â¢ shall decide upon "the
worth of the evidence in prosecuting
the dismissed men. " .
It vis declared that the investigating
officers have evidence that all of the
quartet had made frequent pilfering
expeditions into the grocery of Henry
Cuehing, Thirteenth street, near Clay,
and had been seen carrying off fifty
pound sacks of flour. Not. only did the
grocery suffer, but in the long
list of articles is contained such wares
as women's wraps, dry goods, corsets,
silk, ham, jewelry, dress goods, chil
dren's garments, fountain pens and like
wares.

They regarded it as a primary school measure

there was nothing of the sort Intended by

which requires that military instruction be

Military Instruction is given here by con
tract between the State and the Federal Gov
ernment and the military officer is detailed
here under orders which admit of no excep
tion. All military Instruction is in the form
of and under military discipline. Therefore
there can be no distinction between dni: and
class work. Much of the misunderstanding
among the students has arisen from the fact
that the class usage of the past did not have
the seniors under military rule.
In this controversy I fully realize that the
students have a point of view and I am
anxious to take It. The students have the
point of view of honor, of reason- and of
gentlemen. There Is a point of view of the
lower class men. They have been accustomed
to being "joshed" by the seniors when they
first line up at tha beginning, of the year.
When the seniors themselves had to Una up
the lower class men saw. their chance to turn
the tables. All they did was, I believe, harm
less and good-natured. The college community
calls It "rough-houalng," but it does not
understand that there Is a decided difference
In this kind of work, which comen under the

Two valiant defenders of the game
of football turned up at the university
meeting to-day, when Regent Charles
S. Wheeler of the class of '85 and John
R. Glascock, '84, who are now prom
inent in the public life of the State,
stood sponsor for the gridiron con
tests in which the modern university
takes so deep an Interest. Each speak
er lauded the game that is played with
pigskins, defending it from the at
tacks made upon It recently at the
university by Professor Howison and
by William Greer Harrison.
Professor Howison called the game
barbarous and brutal and Harrison had
referred to It as merely a "head-on col
lision," in which chivalric ideas could
have no place.
Regent Wheeler to-day spoke of foot
ball as worthy of comparison with tha
high standard of Grecian games of old,
declaring that the ideal of the an
cients was not superior to the stan
dards of modern college sportsmen in
their fames on the modern football
field.
Mr. Glascock, a former Mayor of
Oakland, followed Regent Wheeler
with a vigorous defense of the game,
in which he said that it did more than
anything else to develop college spirit
in the thousands of students who make
up a university's life. Â¦ :' '
"TOO MANY CO-EDS," SAYS
UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR
BERKELEY, Nov. 1L, â The annual
"football farce" will be given at the
Alhambra Theater in San Francisco to
morrow evening after the football
game. This has become an annual in
stitution with the University of Cali
fornia, and this year the men from
Berkeley . have taken a fling at the
men from Stanford, as the name of
the play Indicates. "The Mon From
Stonford" is an original two-act bur
lesque written by Chester A. Finch,
H. J. Rogers and Hans Lisser, sopho
moTes.
After the performance the musk: Is
to be published because or. the praise
it has received at the hands of critics.
Not second in any sense to the music
are the libretto and lyrics, which are
clever and catchy. The arrangement
and development of plot has received
the plaudits of Ferris Hartman, Karl
Formes and others. Formes is directing
the production and handling a cast of
forty-five men students. Aside from
the choruses there are nine principal
characters, all of whom have breezy
lines and topical songs, j
The principal lead is taken by Mark
Daniels, a senior, who Is "The Mon
From Stonford," 7 an English character
part, affording exceptional opportunity
for ' the talent of Daniels, who is a
cousin of Frank Daniels, the actor.
Emil Kreuske, ex '05, writer of his
Junior farce, and a college dramatist
who has gone on the professional stage,
takes the second lead. The entire cast
is to be elaborately costumed. "Walter
de Leon, a Junior and also writer of
his- class farce, is in the cast, while
Melvin Jeffers, a senior, member of the
De Kcrven Club and the possessor of a
rich barytone voice, will sing one of
the solos. '.vjV'-S i
The scenes of the burlesque are laid
at Monterey and on the campus at
Berkeley. They deal with the embar
rassing: trials of a Stanrord student of
Sherlock Holmes propensities.
The authors of the production, Rog
ers, Lisser and Finch, have worked to
gether in their, freshman year as stu
dents and in the Becond half of their
first term began the burlesque as a
comic opera. It was written in about
three months and contains fifteen orig
inal pieces of music. Finch is a resi
dent of Spokane. Lisser is the son of
Dr. Louis Lisser, head of the musical
department at Mills College, while
Rogers, before he entered college, work,
ed as a newspaper reporter for three
years on the San Francisco and Oak
land dailies. He has contributed to
college papers' and aside from his lit
erary ability is one of the college car
toonists, being a contributor to the
Pelican and Blue and Gold. He and
Lisser wrote the book and lyrics.
Chester Finch composed the entire
score. He intends after finishing his
work at Berkeley to enter the conser
vatory at Leipsig, Germany, as a stu
dent of music. Each of the authors

were lost souls, yesterday declared In
a lecture on ethics before his class In
philosophy that the "co-eds" at the

students.
Professor Howlson said woman's
curiosity was proverbial and usually
concerned itself with trivial matters.
"It is the university's aim to direct
that curiosity toward worthy and
noble subjects," added the professor,
"but there are so many women stu
dents that they lower the standard of
thinking: and make it necessary for a
teacher to 'water* his remarks so as
to make them intelligible to minds
that are unripe and Insufficiently nour

OAKLAND, Nov. 11. â There must bÂ« some
conjunction of the stars that influences the
socially inclined Just now. for a glance at
next week's social calendar fills the woman
who is popular, but not- ubiquitous, with dis
may. Everybody In town seems to have taken
a sudden notion to entertain some time dur
ing. the week and nearly all the society girls
who have decided on matrimony have selected
some date, between Monday and Sunday next.
Just think of it â four important weddings
next week, to say nothing of the teas, card
parties, luncheons and nmsicales that are all
full of delightful promise.
Even Sunday will have its quota, the R. A.
Brays having bidden a dozen guests to their
Piedmont home to meet Miss Daisy Wlngate
at an informal little dinner. Miss Wlngata
Is a charming young English girl who has
been. visiting Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wlngate
and Is on the eve of departure for her home
In London.

will on that day receive the nuptial blessing â
Miss Mabel Cooley and Miss Evelyn Craig.
Beth will be home weddings and the Craig-
Puttiani marriage will be followed by a re
ception that promises to be one of the sea
son's brilliant affairs, at least 500 cards hav=~
ing been sent out. Gold and . white are the
colors Miss Craiij has chosen for Â¦ her bridal
environment. Her sister. Miss Jessie Craig,
in a. pale yellow gown, will be maid of honor.
The marriage [ of Miss Cooley and Fred
Gowing will be witnessed by Intimate friends

as artistic as ' possible. Miss Bessie Clow is
to be maid of honor and those two pretty sis
ters, Anna and Margaret Franck, will be
bridesmaids. Mr. Gowing; Is to be attended

Then on Wednesday Miss Kendall weds
Kenneth Lowden. It Is said her trousseau
Is exquisite . and she has engagement cups
enough to start a small-sized china store.
The lace that is to trim the wedding gown
is one of Miss Kendall's bridal gifts and is
rarely beautiful. All kinds of gifts have been
showered -upon this lucky young bride and
the home â¢ which Mr. Lowden Is preparing la
delightfully cozy and artistic

In the suit wherein E." A. 3eely, a Seat
tle miningf promoter, sued -L. L. and
Klizabeth C. Mundy for $11,160 al
leged to be due on a mining deal in
Mexico, the defendants yesterday filed
an answer denying the obligation and
a cross-complaint for $3300. They
lived in Oaxaca, Mexico, and owned
250 shares in the San Martin and An
nexas Mining Company, upon which
they gave Seely an option for $50,000.
Scely, they say, induced them to qet
aside $25,000 for the purchase of twen
ty-seven shares outstanding, promising
to divide half of his commission of
$25,000 and 30,000 shares in the pro
posed new company. They say he de
ceived them and got $3300 of their
money and failed to live up to hla
agreement.

| It is decided that rebates which have
j been received by terminals in and
J about the city of Chicago controlled
j by the International Harvester Com
! pany and the United States Steel Cor
poration, popularly known as the har
i vester trust and the steel trust, have
been excessive for the services render
j ed by the terminals In switching car3
to and from roads leading to all sec
tions of the country.
On ths sreneral question involved in
the case, however, the commission has
! decided that it is unlawful for a rail
j road, operated as a common carrier
j and owned by the shipper, to make
I joint rates with other carriers and re
i ceive divisions of such rates; but, on
! the other hand, that it is unlawful un
der the interstate commerce law and
the Elkins amendment for any carrier
â¢ to grant excessive divisions of rates
j to another carrier owned by the ship
'â¢ per for the purpose of securing the
I traffic of that shipper. To the extent
j that such divisions of rates exceed a
j reasonable charge for the service per
j formed, it is decided that they operate
: as a rebate to cut the tariff charge for
! the benefit of the shipper and constl
! tutc undue preference in violation of
| the statute.

With her flags at half-mast, the

Pacific Mall dock. Her commander.
Captain Frank Armstrong, is dead in
Yokohama and the steamer was in
charge of First Officer Ralph l^oboz
Captain Armstrong has been a sufferer
from malarial and typhoid fevers for ;
many months. On the passage out ,
from this port he was hardly able to j
attend to his duties but manfully i
stuck to his post and navigated the '
Fhip over the ocean. When the Cop
tic reached Yokohama on her return â¢
voyage he was almost delirious front |
weakness and reluctantly relinquished;
his command and left the ship for- j
ever. Captain Armstrong was a thor- :
ough seaman, a careful commander, a i
good shipmate and the Occidental and
Oriental Stearr.ship Company !ost a
fatthful and efficient mariner Â¦when he
slipped his moorings and sailed out :
on the shrrol^ss sea. Captain Arm
strong was a widower and is survived
by two vourg children, who live in .
Kr-land."
It Is thought Captain Finch of the ,
Gaelic will be transferred to the Coptic. !
After the present voyage the Gaelic \
will return to England and as Finch
desires to remain on this station, and
moreover is known to be a skillful |
.".minander, there is a strong possi- ;
blllty that he will be Armstrongs rue- ,

The Coptic brought about 1300 tons ]
of freight, a part of which was $2,000,- j

goats were pastured and they were
soon at it, eating until all was gone.
It was not long before there were
fifty very much affected goats, who

they were overcome. , ; Some of them
died that night, others- the. following

"If a player passes or throws up his
hand, he passes out of the game, and

Among other interesting and entertaining pages will be "Some
thing About Pleasing Others," by Kate Thyson Marr; 'On and Off
the Bread Wagon," by Charles Dryden; "The Woman That Stares,"
by Madge Moore ; "How to Buy a Set of Furs," by Augusta Pres

book reviews and the puzzle page.
IN honor of the convention of the American Federation of Labor
which meets in this city next week, the Sunday Call Magazine
to-morrow will be devoted almost exclusively to special labor
articles written by the leading national, State and city labor leaders.
President Samuel Gompers of the American Federation contributes
"The Growth of the American Federation of Labor," an able paper,
tracing briefly the phenomenal progress in influence and member
ship made by this powerful organization; Frank G. Morrison, sec
retary of the' American Federation, contributes "The Future of the
American Federation of Labor," a sane, temperate statement of
the present status of the Federation and of its future outlook; and
James CTConnell, third vice president of the Federation, has a paper
upon "The Open Shop," a subject which is also handled briefly by
Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz.
Of the well known local labor leaders, a majority are repre
sented. Walter Macarthur, editor of, the Coast Seamen's Journal,
prominently known as a speaker and writer upon laboring topics,
and closely identified with labor activities, has a comprehensive ar
ticle upon'the topic "Trades Unions'and Politics." P. H. McCarthy,
president of the San Francisco and California Building Trades Coun
cils, an equally well known figure in local labor circles, contributes
"The Growth of the Building Trades Councils," and Andrew J. Furu
seth, secretary of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific, the third figure
of a notable trio of labor leaders, contributes a paper on "Trades
Unionism Among Seamen," in which are pointed out a few of the
signal benefits that have accrued to the seamen as a result of union
and organization. Will J. French, president of the Allied Printing
Trades, has for subject "The Trades Unions as a Civilizing Factor."
and James G. Maguire discusses the boycott. Miss Lucile Eaves,
prominent as a leader among women working to better the condition
of working girls and children, treats of the conditions surrounding
them in "How Organized Labor Protects the Women and Children."
In addition there is an authoritative unsigned â¢ history of the
labor movement in California written by a prominent labor leader.
The illustrations accompanying the articles are the very finest
halftones, almost all being posed especially for this edition. A full
page is devoted to pictures of the officers of the American Feder
ation. .- ,

I've come to the wrong Chelt
more " Peggy sank crestfallen into
the nearest seat and strove to force
back her tears. Dunbar's heart soft
ened. "Explain, dear." ; *!
"I'm to visit Stella at Cheltmore â
I â I thought there was only one.
When is the next train back?"
"To Philadelphia?" inquired Dun
bar slowly.
"Of course â how soon?"
He evaded the question.
"Peggy, is cold reason so satisfac
tory? Did you miss me just a little?"
"Oh, Jim â but the train â it will be
so late. What will aunt say?" â¢
"I'll satisfy all questions If you an
swer one of mine. Do you love me
enough to share my struggles?"
Peggy tried to take her eyes from
him, but he held her with the strength
of love that shoe In his. She smiled
a little mistily. "It's not wisdom, per
haps â but "
"You trust me absolutely?" demand
ed Dunbar.
"For all time," murmured Peggry.
"Then come, dear!" He hurried her
to the telegraph .office, which was
empty, and began rapidly ticking off
a message. Then he scrawled a few
words on a blank form.
"Sweetheart, prepare to be brave â
your reputation for prudence is shat
tered beyond repair. But as it brought
you to me, I have no complaint. There
is.no train to Philadelphia before noon
to-morrow."
"No train â " she faltered.
"I hated to tell you. That's why I
secured your promise first. I'll take
you now to a friend of mine, Mrs.
Davis. She's a monument of pro
priety."
v"What will Aunt Margaret say?" re
peated Peggy dismally.
"I'm not sure, but she rather likes
me," said Dunbar smiling. "Anyhow,
we shall know when we get her an
swer to my telegram."
"Toursâ what did you say?"
"Read," suggested her lover, as he
held the copy before her, and slipped
one arm around* her, "Peggy arrived â
wedding to-morrowâ come â "
"Oh! â oh!" gasped Peggy in con
fusion, then surrendering herself to his
arms, she whispered, "I love you â "
"You love me â and I've earned pro
motion. We begin life with one hun
dred and fifty, so even 'prudence' may
be appeased."
"But Jimâ tomorrowâ I'm not ready
âwhat will people say?"
"That 'Prudent Peggy' is only hu
man after all; but as you change your
name, what does it matter?"
"Read," Suggested Her Lover.
THE statement that Japan has unofficially sounded Russia with
a peace proposition seems to be something more than a rumor.
It. must 'not be taken as an evidence of military exhaustion on
the part of Japan, for she has a fighting force yet unused of nearly
2.000,000 of soldiers, in all respects as good as those who had added
luster to the history of arms. It is, however, most excellent inter
national tactics for Japan.
The wish of the world is for peace. The opinion of the nations
will not support a continued slaughter merely to secure prestige for
the arms of Russia or Japan. The "latter is credited with fighting a
defensive war. for her national existence, while Russia's enterprise
is for conquest and glory. The nation that fights a defensive war
has the sympathy of \hc* world, while one that is fighting for glory
is looked' upon with cold aversion. A great change is upon the
world, and lapan has the keen insight to sec it. It is strictly in line
with her defensive attitude that she should be the first to propose. a
parley, looking to pence. *
It has been noticed that the Japanese have done no blustering.
They have treated the Russian wounded and prisoners with exem
plary humanity, and have buried the Russian dead with the honors
of war. When the Japanese warships put on their mourning dress
in memory of the brave Makaroff, their enemy, the annals of war
fare recorded a new feature, in a gallant ascription that had never
occurred to the warriors of Christendom. All of this record is in
Japan's favor. She is better off for having made no boasts of what
she would do. In what may occur in the next few weeks it will be
seen that in all this Japan has been preparing the way to peace by
the wise way in which she has made war. She has also been scrupu
lous in avoiding all things that might extend the zone of the war
and complicate other nations in it. With no complaint of her isola
tion she has bravely battled for life.
On the other 'hand, Russia has roused the keen anxiety of
Europe. Twice she has put the peace of the world in jeopardy by
capturing and sinking the merchant ships of neutrals, and by firing
or. the British fishing fleet. She has caused days of foreboding in
many nations and has imperiled international tranquillity. It is
justly feared that a repetition of these acts will prove too much for
diplomatic pationce. It is known that Minister Cambon, who added
to his diplomatic knowledge while in contact with John Hay repre
senting France in Washington, is appalled at the prospect of fur
ther acts by Russia that may lead to general war. This means that
in the outcome France may join the powers that are willing to as
sist the belligerents in coming to terms.
An armistice and a protocol would probably end in peace, but
if the trial be made it must be made with the understanding that
Tapan is not to be treated as she was at the end of her war with
China. The day is gone by in which she can be overrun and over
powered by predatory and dishonest diplomacy, after she has made
good her strength in war. She has won the right to dominate Korea
and the Liaoyang peninsula. Indeed, she has won it twice, once
from China and now from Russia. To admit Russia to the penin
sula and give her back Port Arthur would only mean another war,
for Russia shows little regard for treaties and none for her official
word. *
It is probable that the visit of Prince Fushimi to Washington
will produce results. The United States can do no more honorable
nor humane thing than to lead the way as a peacemaker. It is sure
that other nations will follow, and Japan will be found willing to
try the experiment. The Czar is a weak-headed and a wrong-headed
voung man, but there are some statesmen in his empire who are
aware that there is a world outside of Russia, that must be con
sulted and reckoned with. These are likely to overpower the Grarid
Duke gang, and rescue their country from humiliation abroad and
revolution at home. It is not an inspiring spectacle that the Holy
Synod and the Russian church are obstacles to peace. They fostered
everything that made for war, and their slight knowledge of the
world was shown when they appealed to Christendom to side with
Russia against "a pagan nation."
The World owes Russia something in the matter. It is a mis
guided and misgoverned country that needs the discipline of en
lightenment. Its people are now being beaten with whips and
stuck with bayonets to compel them to ride in cattle cars nearly
io,ooo miles to Asia to fight in a war of which they know nothing,
and are ordered to win a victory which will only bind their own
chains tighter and make them heavier. If their Government can be
made to realize that it must obey international public opinion} in
ternal reforms may come from the same source as peace.
THE PEACE PROPOSAL.
Miss Nathalie Coffin and Miss Dor
othy Eells were the recipients of much
attention last evening at a dance given
in their honor by Mrs. Carter. Pitkin
Pomeroy and her daughter, Miss Chris

While not a very large affair, the
evening was one of unalloyed enjoy
ment, the assembly of young people
being thoroughly congenial.
The home of Mrs. Charles Bertody
Stone on Broderick street was enliven
ed yesterday by the presence of many
friends to extend welcome to Miss Ur
sula Stone. '- -:-z Â¦'Â¦;â¢
â¢The affair, a tea, was given by Mrs.
Stone and Mrs. Thomas Benton Dar

most attractive and a delightful after
noon ensued.

apartments since arriving from Japan.
Mr. Brett was Mexican Consul in
Yokohama and they have been absent
many months.

The limited space of the Presidio
ballroom has placed restriction upon
the invitation list.
An overcrowded dancing room is
anything but pleasant to the partici
pants, so with fewer guests and more
formality are the hops to be character
ized from now on.
Last evening one of the pleasantest
of these affairs took place. Guests from
army and town both were in evidence,
and the conditions were most comfort
able.
Draped flags were mainly used in
decoration and the simplicity waa
effective.

Miss Ethel Valentine will leave for
the East, to make her homo there, on
the 20th. Prior to her departure, many

BEGGY dwelt with her maiden
aunt. She had been brought up
so irreproachably that her pru
dence passed into a proverb among
her friends.
Peggy walked Â¦ circumspectly
through a careless world. So correct
was she that her mere presence was
the stamp of propriety and, had she
been a little older, she colild have
sidetracked all the young matrons as
chaperons. Peggy represented the
phenomenon of an old head on young
shoulders. She looked ahead and was ;
never taken at a disadvantage.
Old maids' children are proverbial
ly flawless. Her aunt expected Peg
gy to love with discrimination and
marry wisely, a fitting crown to so
exemplary a girlhood; but the ap
pearance of James Dunbar proved a
stumbling block. Peggy lost her heart
completely. Only her head saved her
from its weak promptings.
"What you ask is impossible, Jim.
On what should we live?"
"I've* a hundred a month and am
promised a raise."
"Which you can't spend until you
earn. No, Jim, I'm not extravagant,
but how could we live and save for
a rainy dav?"
"Not much to save at first. Surely
you care for me, Peggy? Why, - 1
worship you, so nothing else matters.
I won't let you want and we can wait
for luxuries."
Peggy shook her head. The strug
gle was so great she dared not trust
her voice.
"Well, be engaged â promise to wait
for me."
"Oh, Jim, you tear at my â '*
"Your prudence." Dunbar's voice
grew a little hard.
"I meant heart strings, but that
does not matter. You are going to
Cheltmore in charge of the telegraph
office. The conditions will be new.
We are both young. Aunt Margaret
says we can afford to wait. When
you get your raise â come and ask â "
"Encouraging!" cried Dunbar with
scorn. "Work and plan for a girl
who, for 'pgudent reasons,' may be
married before my aim is accom
plished. If you are afraid to marry
now all right, but at least give me
your promise â or it all ends here."
"It you talk to me like this now,
what will you do when we are mar
ried?"
Peggy in her anger still looked ahead.
They were walking and now they in
stinctively turned toward home.
Aunt Margaret was pleased with her
niece's decision.
"You acted prudently, as always."
Great praise, yet somehow it failed to
comfort Peggy. James Dunbar went
to hia new post without a word, and
life became a dull, spiritless affair to
Peggy. She lost her appetite, and for
got how to laugh. Aunt Margaret,
growing anxious, dosed her with old
fashioned remedies; but neither refer
red to Peggy's decision.
At length came a break in the mo
notony. Stella Moss, recently married,
wrote Peggy of her happiness, and
begged her company for a week. Peggy
read with, amazement, that she lived at
Cheltmore. James Dunbar had been
appointed telegraph operator at Chelt
more. The opportunity could not be
resisted. Peggy in a delirium of hope
fulness accepted with her aunt's per
mission. Neither spoke of the possi
bilities of the visit up to the last day.
then Aunt Margaret cleared her throat.
"My dear, your decision about Mr.
Dunbar was prudent, but â "
"I don't suppose I shall see him,"
ventured Peggy hypocritically.
"He may reopen the â er â subject. Do
not be' hasty. I have been peculiarly
blessed. I have the comfort of a daugh
ter, without the drawback of a hus
band. Every one is so fortunate."
Peggy kissed her aunt, then gather
ing her baggage entered the cab. As
she bought her ticket, the agent in
quired whether she wished Cheltmore,
Pennsylvania or New York.
"Pennsylvania," said Peggy.
It seemed more expensive, and a
longer trip than she had anticipated,
but it was not until late in the after
noon that she suspected a mistake.
The conductor informed her that the
train was due at 7. Peggy re
membered Stella's writing that, if she
took the 3 o'clock train she would ar
j rive in ample time for dinner.
The train pulled out at 3:15 and
Peggy had charged the discrepancy to
her watch. Now she grew anxious.
Her preparations had not been made
with her usual forethought. She had
cared only for tho fact that she was
going to Cheltmore â and that Jim was
I there.
On reaching her destination the
worst was soon known. TherÂ£ was no
such address as Stella : had given, and
the directory proved that 'she did not
reside in Cheltmore, Pa. Peggy, a lit :
tie frightened, retracted her steps to
the station to inquire for the next train
for Philadelphia. The first person she
ran into was Dunbar. Â¦ "r;^
"Peggy â why Peggy -"
Then, remembering their difference,
he thrust his hands into his pockets
and turned silent.
"Jim â Iâ I've done a stupid thing.
HP RUE love between the sexes is
I distinctly an expression of mod
* em life in our Western civiliza
tion. Both antiquity and the Orient
fail to confer upon man's love for
woman the dignity which to-day the
more enlightened nations of our
Western world regard as its just due.
No lover of ancient Greece or Rome
could have written, or even under
stood, what Emerson wrote in his es
say on love. He would not have been
fitted either by education or experi
ence to identify this human passion
with those secret, life-giving springs
of the spirit which ultimately broaden
out into the broad, irresistible stream
of individual life.
Love's Influence upon a woman's
career was interpreted more narrowly
by the classic writers of, old than it
now is. Once a wife's love for her
husband was the love of a slave for
her master. The stories of wifely de
votion which occur in the literature
of the Orient were invented apparent
ly as object lessons for wives, for the
sole benefit of husbands.
A wife is encouraged to share her
husband's Joys and sorrows, but
nothing is said of a reciprocal sympa
thy on his part. Plainly in earlier
ages, and even now in lands which lie
near to the morning sun, women are
expected to be the only ones who in
variably weep alone.
Recently a Frenchman, M. Balzane,
sought to prove that true love is a
modern invention. The argument that
he advanced was Ingenious and orig
inal. Love, pet baby of Olympus, has
at last grown up, ran the tenor of his
thought. Cupid's growth to manhood
has been the slow process of centuries.
From the spoiled child of Homer's
time he has developed, through the
dreaming boy of the middle ages, the
chilvalrous youth of the renaissance,
and the braggart seventeenth century
lover, into a man grown, who has tak
en a wife and is father of a family.
In the domestic life of President
Roosevelt M. Balzane sees the modern
ideal of love best typified.
The chief executive of the world's
great democracy may be taken, he be
lieves, as fairly representative of the
time. ' And such a unity of interests
between man and woman as we see
displayed in the home of the Presi
dent of the United States means an
affection which is not the result of
either fancy or a stroke of fate; "it
is an association of two lives for their
mutual good and to the advantage of
posterity."
To me this seems an illuminative
definition of true love. It gives to this
highest emotion of the soul the dig
nity of purpose â an element of its
importance which lighter definitions
have ignored. It does not present us
with a pretty but foolish picture of
saucy Cupid shooting aimlessly at
hearts with his bow and arrows. It
intimates that absolute congeniality
between the lovers is essential. It pre
supposes that love must be gratified
in order to become perfected.
Love is certainly the ruling force In
our world to-day. The agitation
which questions of marriage laws, di
vorce and race suicide have caused
among us of late years is merely one
expression, of that fact. Love's more
ephemeral charms have been a reg
ular mine of romance and Inspiration
to poet, painter and novelist.
But life has been nourished by
love's more abiding powers. The
truth remains, after the last word â
rhetorlial, psychological or poetical â
has been said, that the race loves In
order to live and that youth lives in
order to love.. Thus turns the wheel
upon itself everlastingly.

The collection of the Hopkins Insti
tute of Art has been enriched by a
striking group in bronze, the gilt of
Raphael Weiil. The work is called
â¢"Primitive man." It jgiiov.s a sturdy ;
giant holding a struggling bear cub j
by the ecruff of the neck.
The group, which attracted attention
at the Paris Salon, was done by a Cal
ifornian, formerly a pupil of the Hop
kins Institute of Art. Edgar 'Walter.
Walter, who is only 27, has already
won a reputation for himself In Paris,
several works of his having received
honorable â¢mention at the salon.
Regarding Edgar Walter the Hopkins
Institute Review of Art says:
His handling o( anfrauls is particularly
hai^r- Indeed, his artibtic talent first found
expre^Flon in this direction, his amusement as
& child being to c-jt from ~ij>f-r the lik*-neeÂ»eÂ«
of hlat four-footed acquaintances. In hiÂ«
bronz* panel. "The Plowman." there is a
bovine ftolidity with a lumbering onward
movement that Ik very real, while , In the
"Primitive Man'' thÂ»- squalling lÂ»-ar cub held
by the scruff of the neck ic humorously true.
It is certainly f\:li of character. The man
himself plar.ied fo sturdily on his two legÂ»
with his tots turned In and his arm thrown
tack to cuff the captive beatt Into submission
1* essentially In face and pose the rude, craftr
wanderer of the primeval forest and plain.
when man etrugfrled single-handed with the
brute forces of nature.
Edpar Walter began his studies In
the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art.
When he was IT he attended the Cal
ifornia School of Design under Pro
fessors Mathews ar.d Douglas Tilden.
A year later he went to Paris and be
came a student in Cormon's atelier.
Later he studied sculpture under M.
Perrln.
The board c-f directors of the institute
are delighted with the gift, which has
already attracted crowds of art au
thorities to the institute. The follow

The many admirers of Mme. Fannie
Francisca will be much interested to
iearn that the singer has been en
gaged by the Tivoli for a special per
formance of "Lucia," to be given at
the Tivoli on Sunday afternoon, No
vember 20. Much enthusiasm wasf
aroused by the singer's rendering of
the "mad scene" from" the Donizetti
opera at her recent concerts, and the
enterprise of the Tivoli in arranging
for her appearance in the name role
will doubtless be largely rewarded.
Mme. Francisca will be surrounded by
an effective cast, that will include Sig
nor Russo In his famous part Of Ed
gardo; Signer Borghese, whose fine
baritone will be heard in the part of
Henry Ashton; Signor Wanrell as Ray
mond, and a newcomer, Signor Zavala,
as Arturo. Mr. Stelndorff will have
an augmented orchestra and direct the
production.
Shortly after her appearance at the
Tivoli, which will be Mme. Franciscans
last appearance here, the singer will
depart for Amsterdam, where she is
under contract --to sing at the Royal
Opera-house.
The seat sale will begin at the Tivoli
on Monday morning next.
No announcement of the current mu
sical season will be of larger interest
than that- the famous virtuoso, Pade
rewskl, will shortly appear here. Ho
returns to the United States after an
absence of many years, and his com
ing will be the signal for wide enthu
siasm. The pianist begins his Ameri
can tour in San Francisco, coming here
by way of Australia. Monday, De
cember 19, Wednesday, December 21,
and Friday, December 23, are the
dates of the concerts, which will be
given in the evening, and at the Al
hambra Theater.

FRANCISCA TO
SING "LUCIA"
AT THE TIVOLI
Pretty Mrs. Tora Tirasawa, 18 yaars
and 7 months old, declares that she
will die before she will consent to live
with the man whom her parents
forced her to marry by photograph In
Japan. She has never seen him, be
cause when they were married he was
in Nevada.
Her parents shipped her thither to
join the man of their choice and when
she arrived she told her story to the
immigration oiiicials. They placed her
in the care of Miss Lake of the Jap
anese Woman's Home Mission, as she
had neither friends nor money and
her photo husband had not made his
appearance.
The bureau has insisted, altogether
without warrant of law, that Japanese
persons married in Japan by photo
graph should be remarried in this
country according to the American
style, under penalty of refusing land
ing to the women who come to meet
their husbands. The girl says that
she did not want to marry Tirasawa
according to the Japanese custom or
any other custom and when pressed
as to her reasons she explained that
she had a sweetheart in her own
country, whom she loved ever so dear
ly. She wished to return and marry
him if "they" would let her.
Immigrant Inspector D. J. Griffiths
has sent for the husband. He says
that If the girl refuses to be remarried
she will not be allowed to land unless
the people at the mission agree to
take care of her.
A suit for divorce was filed yesterday
by Dr. G. R. Hubbell. a physician,
against his wife, Harriet H. Hubbell,
whom he married In 1890. He complains
that for five years she has been un
reasonably jealous of him, spied upon
him, pried into his private affairs, and
even opened his letters from' patients
and declined to surrender them to him.
On July 14 last, he says, she Instigated
her son-in-law, Hinckley, to assault
him. Their community property con
sists of $960 cash and $500 worth of
furniture.
Isabella M. Henry, mother-in-law of
George Monnier Jr., has brought suit
for divorce from her husband, A. K.
Henry, charging him with cruelty in
having caused her arrest for insanity,
of which charge a jury acquitted her.
She asks for $75 a month alimony. They
were married July 4, 1874.
Constable William D. Hyde of Beni
cia is charged by his wife with having
treated her so cruelly that she was
compelled to leave him on October 10
and yesterday she sued him for $30 a
month separate maintenance and $150,
with which to pay for medical services.
In 1899, she says, he .irec three shots
at her and threatened to take her life.
They were married in 1894 and have
three children.
Divorces were granted yesterday by
Judge Troutt to May Macey from

A large audience turned out last
night to hear the first concert of the
Mlnettl Orchestra this season, given
at the Alhambra Theater. The orches
tra showed Itself generally in fine fet
tle, giving evidence of solid and steady
advance on its work of last season,
and performing the very interesting
programme in capable fashion almost
throughout. Where it lacked was In
Intonation, in the brass the trombones
being sharp, the French horn a little
low; and in the woodwind again the
flute high and the oboe flat. The string
choir ia unusually strong, and showed
to much advantage in the very sym
pathetic rendering of "Le Dernier
Commell de la Vierge" (Massenet) that
was heartily encored.
The best work of the evening, how
ever, was done in "Saul," the pictur
esque symphonic poem of Bazzlni, that
showed evidence of admirably complete
and conscientious rehearsal. It waB a
firm and spirited performance, and best
exhibited the persuasive and com
manding grip Mr. Minetti has upon his
forces. The Auber "Massanlello" over
ture, very well handled, opened the
programme, and the "Carmen" Suite,
played with plenty of spirit, closed it.
There was one other number, of which
I shall have more to say when I have
more space, the Vleuxtemps "Ballade
et Polonaise," originally a solo for
violin, and played last night by four
violins with orchestral accompaniment
by Miss Grace Freeman, Miss Grace
Muller, Miss Katharine Johnson and
Miss Winifred Wright. With this ex
ception â I think the idea essentially a
wrong one â the programme was highly
creditable to both conductor and or
chestra. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.

"I puttered from nervousness and
headache until one day about a year
ago it suddenly occurred to me what
a great coffee drinker I was and I
thought may be this migtit have some-
thing to do with my trouble, bo I shift-
ed to tea for a while, but was no bet-
ter, if anything worse.
"At that time I had a baby four
months old that we had to feed on the
bottle, until an old lady friend told me
tw try Postum Food Coffee. Three
months ago I commenced using Pos-
tum, leaving off th* tea and coffee, and
not only have my headaches and ner-
vous troubles entirely disappeared, but
Fince then I have been giving plenty
of nurse for my baby and have a large,
healthy child now.
"I have no desire to drink anything
but Postum and know it has benefited
my children, and I hope all who have
children will try Postum and find out
for themselves what a really wonder-
ful food drink It is." Name given by
Postum Co.. Battle Creek. Mich.
Both tea and coffee contain quanti-
ties of a poisonous drug called Caf-
feine, that directly affects the heart,
kidneys, stomach and nerves. Postum
Is made from cereals only, scientifically
blended to get the coffee flavor. Ten
days' trial of Poetum in place of tea
or coffee will show a health secret
worth more than a gold mine. There's
a reason.

||i|||f Sold Everywhere in Boxes, lOc. and 25c.the last two weeks, made the position
over Smith, last year's 'varsity end,
cind over Stanford and Preston, second
team players, after one of the hardest
fights ever seen on the field. Though
a new player, he is strong and ought
to stop California's fast dashes.
The men in Stanford's back field
Fhould prove more consistent ground
gainers than the California backs.
Bansbach, at quarter, is heady, be
sides being unusually fast and encour
aging to the team. Weller, Dole and
Chalmers are all fast when running
with the ball and are great line buck
ers. There is probably no stronger
man on the coast in backing up a line
than Jim Weller, the big fullback hav
ing both quick intuition and tremen
dous strength. These men are the real
backbone of the Stanford team, and on
thoir ability to gain to-morrow depends
the victory.
liANAGAN'S TIRELESS EFFORTS.
The greatest help of all is "Jim" Lan
agan, Stanford's tireless coach. Work
ing with ceaseless energy, Lanagan has
made a strong team out of fair mate
rial. Without him Stanford would have
no hope, but his successful efforts have
brought forth a well rounded, aggres
sive team, one that has an even chance
to win. All praise to Jimmy Lanagan.
Stanford has played eight preliminary
games this year, winning five, losing
two and tying one. i V Â¦;
Stanfo-d will rely on straight, fast
football to win a victory, expecting the
heavy back formations to make the
most gains. The cardinal team has
developed speed remarkably in the last
two weeks and 'has a much faster of
fense than the eleven that tied Califor
nia last year. It is this method of
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 11.
The 1904 Stanford football team, which
is pronounced the finest fighting ma
chine that has represented Stanford for
many years, will struggle to-morrow
afternoon with California's heavy 'var
sity during seventy minutes of actual
play for the fourteenth annual inter
collegiate football championship of the
coest. There has never been a game
between the two universities harder
fought than this promises to be. The
fact that it Â«rtH be played on a rival
campus will add to its intensity.
The cardinal men. trained to the
hour, expect to pull out a victory, but
they all feel the score will be so close
that the result of the game v.ill be in
doubt until the rc-fc-ree'si whistle sounds
the dose of the second half.
Never before has Stanford sent a
team on the field in such fighting
trim. There is not a bruised muscle
nor a strained ligament, nor a weak
ened ankle among the 'varsity players.
If condition is to play an important
part in the outcome of the game, the
Stanford men should be able to suc
cessfully stand the strain.
WILL. PLAY FAST GAME.
Sprott and Shields, tackles, should
outplay their California opponents, as
both are nearily perfect on defense and
are good ground gainers when carry
ing the ball. Captain George Clark is
probably the best end on the coast. He
has had four years' experience, but
best of all he has a wonderful faculty
for locating the ball at all times. On
right end. the most ticklish place on the
Stanford team this year, because it is
the mighty Snedigar's point of attack,
is a new man. West, a sophomore in
college, by' his clever playing during
Epeedy formation that gives Stanford
some sHght advantage over other
teams. On this rapid playing rest the
hopes of victory. Then, too, there are
nine veterans on the cardinal team,
and thpae men should prove a tower
of strength. Tha only positions filled
b> new men are center and right end,
Hyde, a last year's second team man,
filling the former, and "West, sub end
on the 1907 freshman team, playing in
thÂ« latter position. The presence of so
many old players In the same lessens
the chance of the cardinal team's be
ing fooled by trick plays and of be
ing scored on during the confusion.
With the exception of center, Stan
ford's line Is the equal of that of Cali
fornia, Stroud at center will be su
perior to Hyde, but the latter will be
greatly helped by Thompson and
Roosevelt, lK>th of whom are strong
and aggressive guards.

The three-time cups which the di
rectors of the California Club put up
a little over a year 'ago were disposed
of last Sunday. George Janes and
Herbert Long have three consecutive
victories to their credit and the cups
are their property for all time.
The game put up by Janes on Sun
day was a surprise. He was easily the
best of the four and 1 did some remark
ably good work. Gardner did some
scientific lobbing, but was beat at the
net at critical times. Janes has-im
proved wonderfully since he joined
the California Club a few: months ago.
Play ; will be resumed in the handi
cap doubles tournament at the park
to-morrow. Seven teams!have.reach
ed the second round. T.he only first
round match yet to be played is that

The project of bringing several of
the Eastern tennis experts to this
coast to play next month has not been
abandoned, although it is extremely
doubtful if the men will come. Ex-
Champion Bell spoke to the leading
players while he was in the East and
they seemed anxious to come. The
Southern California players have been
in communication^vvith the Eastern
cracks for some time and if they get
the proper financial support from the
players In this city it is likely the na
tional champions will be seen in com
petition here. A San Francisco play
er received a letter from George
"Wright during the week, in which he
says the chances of any of .the cracks
visiting the coast this winter are slim.
The California Club directors will
hold a meeting on Tuesday night. The
chief business will be to discuss this
project. The players seem to favor
having a joint tournament at the most
central point. in the State. The visit
ore would probably play several exhi
bition matches on- the California Club
courts. I

The greyhounds are evenly matched
in the draw, and some sensational trials
are expected. The meeting of Barge
and McVey this afternoon will be one
of the features of the stake.
This stake always brings out the old
time coursing men, and the advance
guard is already here. Al. Austin, for
merly well known here, is up from Los
Angeles to see the stake. R. B. More
head, owner of New Home Boy, is also
on the ground. E. Janlcke, Del Cor

Los Angeles contingent.
D. J. Healy, the Prince of Petaluma;
J. Sheridan, Alex McLecd and Dave
Chella will represent the home of the

Sacramento will send down the three
"Walsh brothers .and Messrs. Condrey,
Raught, G. Nethercott, E. Scott, M. C.
Delano and Freeman.
T. Hall, without whose presence a
John Grace Cup day would not seem
complete, will be here from Fresno.
"Poker George" Whalen of Modesto
will also represent the Valley.
Knight and Kent have ; arrived from.
Butte, Montana, with Grafton, the
fleetest greyhound in the Middle "West.
In the same kennel is Rusty, a clever
performer.
There will be no coursing at Ingle
side Park to-day or to-morrow.
The East is not as strongly repre
sented as was at first expected. This
is explained by the fact that the crack
Montana greyhounds which competed
in the American Waterloo at Friend,
Neb., succumbed to the water there
and will not be able to run for some
time. Â¦. . Â¦;
The tenth renewal of ~the John Grace
Challenge Club for greyhounds will be
commenced this morning at Union
Coursing Park. The stake, which is
worth about $3500 this year, has at
tracted a remarkable entry of high
class hounds.

RICH STAKES
FOR COURSERS
The Eagles are a newly formed club,
consisting of members of the Hospital
Corps of Alameda. They have been
coached by A. J. Churchill, who was
a well-known player in the Albion
Rovers' team last year. The first game
set down to be played by the Eaglea
was against the Pickwicks at Free
man's Park on October SO. The Eagles
forfeited this match because their
players had not been registered with
the secretary of the league nor as
amateur athletes with the Pacific As
sociation. These defects have been
remedied and the Eagles are registered
and .qualified players.

TEAM MEETS
THE ROVERS
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12. 190i.
10Claude Kern, who captained the
freshman team last, year, win play
right half on the 'varsity. Kern was
the best ground gainer on hfs team.
He rnptnred a blood vessel last year
and was put out of the game or he
would have made the 'varsity then.
His hacking is hard to stop. His end
running is fast, and he Is good at fol
lowing Interference.
Boothe, who may run the team at
quarter, Is from Spokane, where he
makes.
TEAM WORK A FACTOR.
Hopper has taught the men team
BERKELEY, Nov. 1Lâ On the eve of
the big football game with Stanford,
Coach "Jimmie" Hopper is still unde
cided regarding the exact line up of
the blue and gold team that will be
aent into the field for the first half.
It. is freely admitted by Hopper and
by every blue and gold man that the
team which California puts on the grid
iron this year to battle with the crack
eleven from Stanford is what men call
a "green team." Only six out of the
eleven mjn selected to wear the sweat
ers with a big "C" on them have played
'varsity football before, a showing ex
ceeded by Stanford, according to re
port of the personnel of the cardinal
eleven sent out from the rival univer
sity.
The veterans In thÂ» blue and gold
ranks include Captain Ben Stroud,
"Heine" Heitmuller, "Greek" Howard.
Ed Stern, James Snedigar and "Sunny
Jim" Force. The last two men entered
the game with Stanford last year rath
er late, but still they are classed as
veterans because of that taste of battle.
The team is the lightest California has
had to carry its colors for a number of
years. Despite this circumstance and
the knowledge, too, that as Coach Hop
per says, the California team is a green
team, confidence In its ability to hold
the cardinal and eventually to beat
the Stanford stars is almost perfect.
Wlllard Sperry Is the lone freshman
on the team. He had never played
football before coming to the univer
sity. At Christmas last year he made
a "C" at the track and soon was put
on the 'varsity squad. Sperry towered
above all the men on the freshman
team this year, and Is called "Cannon
ball" because of the great gains he
Roy H. Elliot, a green man. will have
an end place, probably the right end.
He has never played 'varsity football
before. He Is looked upon as particu
larly good at running In punts an<J
stopping up trick plays. It has been
found hard work to get around his end
by opposing teams In preliminary,
games this season.
"Jack" Belknap. the only married
man on the team, has played as quar
terback with marked ability. He gets
the team Into play more rapidly than
any quarterback seen here in recent
year?. His Jugdment Is excellent, and
though the smallest man on the team,
he is always In the scrimmages. He
played two years at Dartmouth and
has also played with Reliance on this
coast.
KELT OX IIEITMXriJLER.
William F. Heitmuller. called
"Heine," will have the place of left
tackle. He was the hero of last year's
game when he got through Sprott.
blocking a punt and making a touch
down, saving the game for California.
Heitmuller has been on the 'varsity for
three years. He does the puntiutf for
the team, and Is looked upon aa sec
ond only to Overall in this feature of
the same. He is from the Lick School
In San Francisco, where he played for
three years as a tackle.
"Greek" Howard will be at left end.
He, too. has played for three years
on the 'varsity. He was left tackle in
1902 and 1904, and made a fine showing
against Stanford's best men. He was
put on the end this year, however, be
cause good ends were scarce. Force
was able to take his place at tackle
without marring 1 the effectiveness of
the team. Howard In this new posi
tion has made good. He ts from Oak
land High School, where for three years
he played as guard and halfback, cap
taining the team. In his freshman
year here he played guard on the fresh
man lÂ»am.
half. He substituted as a tackle. Force
is from the Colorado School of Mines.
He play?d on the North Denver High
School team as tackle.
On the right of Captain Stroud will
be Edgar Stern, who was the fullback
on the 'varsity team last year. He i3
the heaviest man on the team except
Stroud. Besides his experience on the
'varsity. Stern had several years' play
as fullback and end of the Arcata High
School team, which he captained during
one season. He is especially effective
at offensive work, many of the gains
made in preliminary games this season
being directly traceable to him.
Prentlss N. Gray is to be left guard.
He has never, played against Stanford,
but despite the fact, he Is not looked
upon as an inexperienced man. Gray
played left guard, on the freshman
team here during his first year and
in his sophomore year was on the sec
ond eleven. At the Oakland* High
School he played for two 'years as
guard and tackle. Gray's endurance
work, and in the art of instilling abil
ity to move as a machine Hopper Is
conceded to be a past master. His ef
forts have beÂ«n directed to that end
and the result has gratified him bÂ«yun<i
measure. He has seen a lot of green
men gÂ«t into the play with the few vet
erans on the team in perfect unison
and with a surprising force aa the re
sult of the good team work developed
In the movement. Each man has had
it drilled and pounded into* him that
victory will be theirs if always they
work together, each for the team and
the team for each man.
Both coach and captain pronounce
the men in excellent condition, despite
the handicap that attacks of measles
and minor ailments put upon the eleven
during the last week. The polishing
off process has been well done, and each
man of the eleven that will sally out
on the new California field to-morrow
will be fit. There will be no talk at
Berkeley of bad luck in the matter of
poorly conditioned players.
Captain Ben Stroud rates his team as
six points better than Stanford. Stroud
does not talk much. His words count
for a good deal when he does give them
out. The big captain has played three
times against Stanford, and has fairly
earned the honor of captaining Cali
fornia's eleven. Stroud has always
played center, except in his freshman
year, when Overall was ruled off for
slugging and Stroud took his place for
the remainder of the game. He is 23
years old, five feet nine inches and a
half tall and a prominent fraternity
man.
and ability to stand punishment is
looked upon as remarkable by his team
mates, all of whom have marveled at
the man's absolute disregard of physi
cal pain in rough scrimmages. Never
a play but he is In the midst of it and
always hard at work.
"Sunny Jim" Force will be at right
tackle Force is a sophomore, but he
made the team with comparative ease.
He played substitute fullback last year
and was in the big game in the last

The line-up of the Stanford eleven' in to-day's game is known definitely, but the Berkeley coaches
eeem undecided as to three positions. It Is expected Howard will go -'in at left end, until it is demonstrated
how Force is doing at tackle. Should Force fail to perform brilliantly Howard will be shifted to tackle
and Kittrelle will succeed him on the left end. Howard is sure to /be used at some stage of the game, as is
also Kittrelle, and the likelihood Is they will get into the game in Just about the manner described in the fore

In the first half the honors were about
even and at no time was either team

The Horace Mann boys had a decided
advantage throughout the second half.
They worked the ball down to their
opponents' one yard line, but lost the
ball on downs. The entire half was
played in Horace Mann's territory. The

Excellent Card for the
Opening Day.
CLASSY FIELD
IN HANDICAP
marked excellence. In contradiction
of the report that the mushroom
growth of winter tracks on the other
tide of the Rockies might cause a
scarcity of horses on the coast the
management of the New Oakland Jock
ey Club found it necessary to lengthen
the card to seven events.
Many old favorites will be noticed in
the different events, with a liberal
sprinkling of Easterners. As the
horses which have been racing on the
Chicago and Xew "York tracks become
acclimated they will make an early de
but, for tbe major portion of owners
a:e avaricious, when fat stakes and
purses are hung up.
Thousands have been expended in
beautifying and Improving the track
PfTPfff the bay, until it is one of the
most imposing and beautiful racing
plants in the country.
The transportation facilities will be
found perfect. As In former seasons,
the first race will be called at 2:05
o'clock.
E. C. Hopper, one of the best known
tnd most popular racing officials in
the country, will preside in the stand,
a. position he has filled for several
seasons. Two more competent starters
That Dick Dwyer and Jake Holtman
it would be difficult to find. They have
been engaged to do the starting again
luring the corning season. Dick will
lead off to-diy with the barrier.
With $2000 in added money the Open
ing handicap at a mile overshadows
the oth^r events from every stand
point. There will be at least a dozen
starters, with the prospect of the Jen
:.:r.gs pair. Arcade 110 pounds and
Gold Money 118 pounds, coupled in the
betting, going to the post favorite.
Walter Jennings will be deprived of the
use of his freshly signed rider, \V. Da
vis, en thip occasion. Tht young man.
who created such a sensation in New
York, will not reach here until to-mor
row.
Claude, the war horse cf Mike Daly's
arables, ha* not shown to any advan
tage in his workouts, and in the down
town resorts last night had few friends.
Â¦ The clocking brigade was inclined to
Etring theirs on the chances of Bom
bardier, the California Derby winner.
Fossil and G. %V. Trahern. Johnny
.-.-.: r hp* a useful piece of material in
Ananias and if the three-year-old
should happen to outbreak his com
pany he may prove a hard one to
catch.
From the outlook there will be eigh
teen or more books in the ring. The
letting realm has been enlarged and
speculators will find it much easier
making a circuit of the bases to get
aboard some good thing than in past
seasons.
Illlde brand will not be here until
next week, so, unfortunately, his ad
mirers will have no opportunity to
back his mounts this afternoon. There
if no dearth of riding talent, for Eddie
Dominick. Helgesen. "Big Bill" Knapp.
H. Larsen, Joe Jones, Sam Greennel*.
Herbert, the pride of the jungles,
"HandrMtng" Kelly, Roscoe Coleman
and other clever boys will be seen In
the saddle.
Clem Jenkins, the Jockey, starts for
California the coming week. He is in
New York* at present.
The stables of A. F. Dayton & Co.
and Jere Dunn are due to arrive at
Oakland next week.

A STRONG AGGREGATION AGAINST STANFORD
FOOTBALL MEN
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, , SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12, . 1904.
"This season has been a hard one, the hardest one I hava ever bees tlroagL .Â¥â¢
have been especially unfortunate both in the number tnd in the severity of the in
juries received by cor men- The hot. weather haa made football a isver* trial to
most of the squad- The teas ae a whole is ia good condition. Xe?ile3 has left a
traea lutonly a traca, on the nÂ«3. In act. mot; of the men are is exo lisa* coaii
tion- Will we wiij the gime? Well, we'll fight from the start to the fbiin. I thiai
we are six points better thin Stanford and will win. but after a hsri figit- If our
defense ean hold down their offense we ean win without question, far nothing can
stop our backs."
CAPTAIN STROUD OF CALIFORNIA SAYS:
' The Berkeley men who have ken selected to plaj in tie guns with Stanford are all
in excellent condition. Concerning the talk hitherto nude in certain quarters abont
the alleged stslenesi of the team, I have only to say the excitement jricr to a hi;
game always dissipates the effect <f any apparent staleosss that ia 17. have been dis
cerned in the team. The men are sound all through and their condition ii fjirly
good. There is no reason to suppose we will not win the game with Stanford. I
think we are an even match f or the Stanford . team- The team is whit some would
call a green one and no one can tell what a green team will do- I want to say we
have a team as 1 not a csl eitioa of sta Â»."

Stanford Students Burn Red Fire
Near the Abiding Place of
Their Opponents.
Berkeley, ordinarily resplendent
with gold and blue, blazed with the
cardinal color for several hours last
night. About 7:30 o'clock the Cali
fornia students were amazed to find
the staid hilis around Berkeley blaz
ing with the cardinal color, the whole
sky aflame with the Stanford hue. An
invading party hurried up to disperse
the trespassers, but the birds had
flown, only a hot ash pile showing
where the enterprising. Stanford men
had been. This is the second time the
cardinal contingent has surprised
Berkeley. Last year a big -block "S"
was raised in the dead of night on
Goat Island and while the California
bands of rooters passed on the boats to
San Francisco this Stanford "S"
hurled defiance at them, for they
dared not land to take it down. The
men from Palo Alto claim this burn
ing of cardinal flame on the Berkeley
hills Is but a beginning and many new
and startling features will be intro
duced on the bleachers to-morrow.

Is the Only Feature in Game Won by
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 11. â It would
be difficult to imagine a more listless
or a more uninteresting ball game
than the one to-day between Los An
geles and Portland. The Angels won
as they pleased, outplaying the north
erners in every department of the
game. Ross' phenomenal catch of a
line drive in left center was the only
feature that relieved the monotony.

ROSS' SPECTACULAR CATCH.
CARDINAL IS DISPLAYED
OX THE BERKELEY HILLS
The eighth spasm seems to be the
one where the Seals figure. They
never had a peep In till then yester
day at Recreation Park, when they
rallied long enough to bring home the
coin. On the previous day they rout
ed the Slwashes In the same fatal pe
riod. It was a hair-raiser all the way
and the run in the eighth was the
only one In the game.
That disastrous base on balls that
has broken up many a good ball
game was the turning point of the
struggle yesterday. Hall issued It to
Van Buren after one had been chased
to the bench in the eighth. Then
Waldron tapped to Russ Hall, who
threw to Delmas with the intention
of making a fast double play. Del
failed to mitt the ball and both -were
safe. Along came "Wooden Shoes Andy
Anderson with a drive out to left field.
Van Buren raced for the plate and
arrived safe and sound with one that
was due for so long. ,,
Hall tossed a swell game of ball, al
lowing only three hits. Although the
Siwashes gained seven from the offer-
Ings of Barber he was steady at all
times and was always there. He also
had a little luck and was backed in
splendid style. Score:

STANDING OF THE CLUBS
By a majority vote of 3 to 2 the Su
pervisors' joint Committee on Police
and Judiciary reported yesterday in
tavor of repealing the ordinance per
mitting betting on races between dogs
for a period of 104 days in each year.
The effwt of the repeal, if approved
by the Board of Supervisors, will be
the closing of Ingleside Coursing Park..
The vote on the repeal was:
Ayesâ Comte, Booth, Eoxtonâ 3.
Noesâ Eggers, McClellanâ 2.
Hoxton was not present at the meet
ing, owing to Illness, but telephoned
that he voted In favor of repealing the
ordinance. ..
Eggers and McClellan stated they
voted against the closing of the
coursing park because they did not
think the charges that women and
children had been allowed to bet and
drink and that dogs were drugged or
"doped" had been proven In the pub
lic investigation. The committee
agreed not to discuss the matter, but
to refer it for action to the entire
board at next Monday's meeting.
Brandenstein, the sixth member of the
joint committee, was not present, but
it is understood that he will vote with
the majority.
The committee also reported In favor
of a proposed amended ordinance to
insure the conviction of any one sell
ing pools on horse races outside of the
track inclosure. Chief of Police Witt
man notified the committee that con
victions were Impossible, because It
was necessary under the terms of the
existing ordinance to prove that the
races had been actually run. This
would necessitate the bringing of eye
witnesses to races in the East, on
which most of the pools are sold in
cigar stores and saloons.
The committee agreed to the sug
gestion of Chief Wittman that the or
dinance be amended -so that the pros
ecution will not be required to prove
that the races actually took place.
This was done by making it a misde
meanor "to buy or sell pools or make
books or make or receive as principal
or agent or otherwise any bet or wager
on a race, understood or purported to
be run. between horses, except within
the inclosure of the racetrack.
The committee also recommended the
enactment of an ordinance prohibiting
the shaking of dice for money in pub
lic places.

Hay and Feedstuffs.
Bran is steady with Oregon selling from
flret hands at ?17 50.
Hay was dull yesterday, receipts being very
small and the demand equally so. The Hay
j merchants are again complaining of the slow
1 ness of the railroads in getting the goods Into
i this market saying that it has recently taken
! three or four days to get Hay In from points
Â¦ not over thirty miles from San Francisco.
i This seriously interferes with the ehipment
of export orders. Then again. It takes a long;
time to obtain cars, so altogether the Hay
men seem to be having a hard, time getting
the goods into market.

livery the market soon assumed a firmer feel-
Ing. Bullish features of early trading were
a continual small movement In the North
west and decreased shipments from Argentine.
A number of messages also were received

demand there showed considerable Improve
ment. The effects of damage reports, how
ever, were more or less offset by a St. Louts
trade paper claim that the crop as a whole
1Â« in excellent condition. After selling up to
$1 15 December closed at $1 14%. May closed
at $1 14%.
Small stocks In store, an urgent- cash demand

to a strong tone in the speculative market.

All handlers reported the Poultry market la
good shape with the demand brisk, particu
larly for chicken*. Receipts from domrstlo
shipping points were 61 coops, and as there
Â¦was no Western offering the market cleaned
up quickly. : Hens and Broilers, which had

wanted and Â¦ brought higher prices. Dressed
Turkeys sold at 20@24c per lb for No. 2 stock,
while prime fancy stock sold up to 26c.
Receipts of Game ware, light and Wild
Ducks, which formed but a small percentage

RADCL1FFE JURY FAILS
TO AGRE.E ON VERDICT
Chung Pao Shi, Consul General for
China in San -Francisco, was on the
stand all yesterday afternoon in Judge
Coftey's court to tell of the. marriage
Jaws and customs in China. Round,
rubicund, smiling, alert and garbed in
a rich black brocade, he was the most
interesting witness yet called in the
Chew Bin? Quoia case, wherein it is
sought to remove J. J. Cunningham, as
administrator of the estate of the dead
labor contractor. The examination of
the dignitary was not concluded and
he will sÂ° on again to-day, as a mat
ter of courtesy, he not having been
subp^naed.
The Consul General answered a few
questions in English, but for the most
part his testimony was given through
an interpreter, .who is also a person
age â Vice Consul Owyang King, a
graduate of Yale, mechanical engineer
by profession, but who has been.fn the
consular service for twenty years.
In qualifying as an expert witness,
to th" satisfaction of the court but
against the objections and keen ques
tioning of Attorney J. E. Hill, the Con
sul General, said that he was forty
years old and had been born in Chinese
officialdomâ his father was an inspec
tor and the son was in the service as
auditor for the treasury department at
Peking. Five years ago he was ap
pointed Consul at New York and two
years ago came to his present post. In
qualifying for his career he had read
all the laws of China, partly out " of
curiosity, as he was required to pass
no examination on law until after
three years in the consular service.
Attorneys Vogelsang and Dibble, who
are trying to prove that the American
claimant, Lum Quola. was the concu
bine and not the wife of Quola, pro
duced twenty-four tissue volumes, tied
between polished boards and purport
ing to be the compilation of the laws
of the empire. The Consul General
said they were only part of the laws.
The .first volume, containing the title
page was offered in evidence and
proved the books to be "the laws writ
ten by Emperor Sai Chlng Hin, known
as 'The Origin of Laws and Their Ex
planations' and also recording all the
important laws made and decreed to
be enforced throughout the empire up
to the first year of the reign of t Kung
Si."
The seventh volume was offered, too,
and it contained the laws on marriage
and bigamy. Among the interesting
provisions therein is that before a mar
riage the v man or woman must make
Â¦ known to the other whether he or she
is affected with any illness or deform
ity; whether born of\.a concubine and
whether or not adopted by other mem
bers, of the same tribe. The "three
generations,", or lineage register, is the
most important requirement of the
marriage contract. It is also provided
that if a man treat his wife as a con
cubine he shall.be whipped with a rod
100 blows; 90 blows is the punishment
if he treats his concubine as a wife,
and in- either case the woman must be
restored to her proper station. If a
man â¢ attempts to take another -wife
while he has one ' living he shall- re
ceive 90 fclows. . . ,
These laws, ! said the Consul General,
are observed' in the empire, but minor
matters in the marriage ceremony may
vary.' The' witness added that there
â¢were no lawyers in China and when
controversies were brought before a
Judge he did all the questioning.
The following were the Jurors: J. J.
McEwen, foreman; Charles E. Wehn,
Fred G. Luca Jr.. J. Craig, E. B. Sny
der Con Reean. Joseph Wells, and
George W. Wiley.

In the case of Frank Mahler, who
was suffocated at 408U Natoma street
on November 6, either by accident or
suicide, the jury said:
And we condemn the gas company of this
city for delivering this quality of gas to Its
customers.
In the case of Martin Schneider, ac
cidentally suffocated at 2936 Steiner

Se\*ere condemnation was visited

of a Coroner's jury yesterday in sev

poisoning by inhalation of illuminat
ing gas.
The 'first case was that of James
Garrett. who was suffocated last Sun
day night at 1815 Dupont street. The
jury was unable to determine whether
It was a case of accident or suicide,
but added:
And we condemn in the strongest terms the

deadly poison into the homes. It appearing

who desire to visit points in Tuolumne
County can obtain this rate by first
procuring a letter of identification
from the California Promotion Com
mittee to the Sierra Railway Com
pany's agent in Oakdale.
The chief reason why California affords op
portunity for a maximum of productive effort
In a minimum of time lies in the possession
of a semi-tropical . climate. Of course the
same plant or the same kind of plants, per
haps, is not always growing, but the con
ditions for growth are always present and
each plant or kind of plants seizes upon this
constant-growing force and Is carried to Its
maturity.

OF CHINA'S LAW
Lewis Epstein, a dealer in second
hand hardware. 538 Mission street.
was booked at the City Prison yester
day by Detectives Matheson and
Braig on two charges of receiving sto
len goods. He was released on $500
bonds on each charge. Hardware to
the value of about $150 was booked
as evidence against him.
The police had been notified by the
Pacific Hardware and Steel Company.
Mission and Fremont streets, that ar
ticles were being stolen from their
â¢warehouse and a young 1 man In charge
of one of the departments was sus
pected. Matheson and Braig were de
tailed on the case and on Thursday
Matheson. who was on watch in the
warehouse, saw the salesman hand
Epstein a parcel. Epstein was prompt
ly arrested. The parcel was found to
contain a box. of auger bits and a
brush hook. "When Epstein's store
was searched about $150 worth of
other articles stolen from the ware
house were found and seized.
The salesman made a confession
and said the stealing had been going
on since September 1. He blamed Ep
stein for inducing him to steal the
articles, for which the Junk man paid
a comparatively trifling sum. For the
sake of the salesman s family the
company refuses to prosecute him or
divulge his name.

Some time ago the Rock Island Rail
rcad Company had a sale of lots in
Oklahoma. A uniform price of 525
each was charged. Mr. Nickel, who, in
addition to his political position in
this city, is editor of the Acton
Rooster, published in Los Angeles
County, knew what was going on and
purchased two lots. T'nder the plan of
sÂ»Je he was permitted to draw for
choice of lots. One choice fell on the
present site of the church in question.
V. r hen the purchase was made there
was no building in the neighborhood.
In due time Mr. Nickel received his
dÂ«*Â»ds to the properties. In some way
the church people were led, mistaken
ly, to beliex-e that they were building
on the proper site. It was only when
th* church was done, the spire duly
erected and the pastor installed that
the iniftake was discovered. Then
there was some excitement in the new
town of Breckenridge. The land de
partment of the Rock Island Railroad
was appealed to and a railway official
vrrote about the church to Mr. NickeL
The Port Warden may decide what to
do in a day or two.
Mr. Xickel oonflded his Quandary to
several of his friends along the city
water front yesterday. They "were in
clined at first to think the whole mat
ter the work of a practical joker, so
unusual was the story. When they
read the letter they were convinced
that Mr. Nickel actually possesses the
singular distinction of being the real
owner of a church building complete,
the ownership going with the lot as a
matter of law. Nevertheless Mr.
Nickel does not wish to take the struc
ture from the congregation that has
erected it. Possibly the church people
may mow It off to some other locality
and po solve the problem in that
â¢way.
Probably the most puzzled man In
San Francisco to-day is Port Warden
R. E. NlckeL His mental condition Is
due to thÂ« receipt of a letter yesterday
announcing tfcat he Is the owner of a
church ediiloe, a fact of which he had
no previous knowledge. When he read
the letter he rubbed his eyes vigor
ously and then looked a second time
nt tho address on tie envelope. There
was no doubt about It. A church has
been built on a lot he own* in the
town of BreckenridgÂ«, Oklahoma, and
he is either compelled to own a com
pleted church or to part with his lot.
He has no desire to acquire a church
that has been built with the money of
a devoted congregation In Oklahoma
and he docs not wish to sell his real
estate. The fact that a church has
been placed on the lot convinces him
that the location is good and cen
tral.
William Broderick was indignant on
Thursday because Lilienfeld had sub
penaed witnesses in a cape without
consulting any other members. Secre
tary Welch had refused to send out
subpenas in another rase because he
knew the foreman had a new matter
for consideration that would occupy
the entire afternoon. There was much
acrimony over such phases, and after
adjournment Lilienfeld's disgust im
pelled him to ask to be relieved of the
loremanship.
The members favored the sugges
tion of disbanding, but some of the
committees protested that they could
not have their report ready by next
Thursday, and it was decided to post
pone adjournment for a week from
next Thursday. It is presumed that
Foreman Lilienfeld communicated this
fact to Judge Kerrigan, who was guid
ed by it.
Lilienfeld tendered his resignation
because other jurors in insulting fash
ion made ill-founded accusation
against him that he had given infor
mation to the press. Those who voted
against the prosecution of the Elec
tion Commissioners were indignant
that their names had been printed, and
they place the responsibility on the
foreman. >>
It was given out by Judge Kerrigan
that his reason for bringing the Grand
Jury to a close was to inaugurate a
new system of service. It Is his pur
pose to call another at once to serve
the rest of this and the first two
months of next year. It is to be then
disbanded and another impaneled to
servo the remainder of the half of the
fiscal year. Judge Kerrigan wishes to
arrange the sittings of grand juries so
that one of the two will begin its ses
sions at the opening of a fiscal year
and the other adjourn at its end. The
law provides that there shall be two
grand Juries during the year.
Under this arrangement each pre
siding Judge, who serves In that hon
orary capacity for one year at a
time, will have the impanelment of
two inquisitorial bodies. This largely
was the end Judge Kerrigan had in
view when he informed Lilienfeld that
the present jury should bring its la
bors to a close at as early a date as
possible. The idea has been approved
by District Attorney Byington and
Judge Lawlor, who will be the next
presiding Judge.
Before the Grand Jury adjourned on
Thursday evening Wakefield Baker
moved that steps be taken to have it
disbanded at the meeting next Thurs
day. He believed that the discord
among its members had created a sit
uation in which it was impossible to
accomplish any further good work. He
ftlt that he had done his duty, for his
efforts were the best he had to put
forth, though they were not altogether
successful.
Presiding Judge Kerrigan refused
yesterday to accept the resignation of
Alfred Lllienfeld as foreman of the
Grand Jury, forwarded by Judge Law
lor, for the reason that the court con
templates an early disbanding of tho
inquisitorial body and deemed it best
that he should continue to serve as
the presiding OiTicef'until the final ad
journment, which is expected to take
place a week from next Thursday. He
told Mr. Lllienfeld to inform the jury
that the court desired it to terminate
Its labors and make its report within
two weeks.
More than sixteen years ago Freder
ick Wass was adjudged an incompe
tent. On June 12, 18S8, his brother Dy
son obtained letters of guardianship
over him, representing that he was in
capable of caring for his estate and
had sold his interest" in the property
left by his father in Oregon for one
fifth of its. value.
A few years ago the incompetent dis
appeared. "When Dyson died distant
relatives undertook to get the estate,
but Isabella M. Wass, a contract wife,
appeared, established her status in
court, and was appointed administra
trix. In August of this year Lucretia
Anderson, a remote cousin, applied to
the court for letters of guardianship
over. Frederick, and when a citation
was issued she< reported that Bhe was
unable to serve it on the supposed in
competent because his whereabouts
was unknown.
Friends of the man had an idea that
he was to be deprived of his inheri
tance. They had heard that Wass was
in the Santa Cruz Mountains and so re
ported to Attorneys Stephens and Cur
tiss Hillyer. A search was instituted
and Wass was found last Friday near
Wrights, where he had been engaged
in the making of artistic furniture.
Yesterday he filed a petition in the
court for restoration to competency. A
similar application was made for him
by W. E. Quinn, a friend, on November
3, and Judge Coffey has set November
17 as a day for hearing the petition.
That he will be restored to . capacity
his attorneys have no doubt.- He was
in their office yesterday and discussed
all the phases of the case in a manner,
Mr. Stephens says, which makes it ap
parent that he is as capable and in
telligent as the average man. He has
given them information regarding fam
ily affairs covering a period of twenty
years, and Stephens says there will be
no difficulty in getting mm at least a
fourth of the estate. This opinion, says
the lawyer, is shared by Attorney T.
C. Van Ness, who represents the ad
ministratrix.
After a horseback search through the
Santa Cruz Mountains, Instigated by-
Attorney J. A. Stephens, Frederick W.
Wasa has been found and brought to
San Francisco to share in the $160,000
estate left by his brother, Dyson D.
Wass, an electrical contractor who died
intestate last spring. The brother, who
has not been heard from far three
years, will receive at least a fourth of
the fortune, and possibly more, which
he would have lost had he remained
away until December 2.
