number of spectators' seats vacant.

was responded to with hearty, though
not prolonged, applause. The lack of

CHICAGO. June 21.â Without a dis
turbing clement to impede smooth
operation, the first day's programme of
the Republican National Convention
was curried out like clockwork. Not a
Jarring sound was heard, not a false
etep taken. It was an assembly of
non-combatant delegates which carried
into effect, without the thunderous
demonstration usually attendant upon
political conventions, a purpose that
had been clearly defined.
An organization was perfected pre
paratory to the adoption of a plat
form and the making of nominations
in the succeeding days of the conven
tion. From the quiet, yet unmistak
able, enthusiasm provoked by senator
Fairbanks' arrival at the Coliseum, his
nomination for Vice President is but
little less assured than the nomination
of Theodore Roosevelt for President.
The keynote to the campaign of 1904
was eounded by Elihu Root . in his
speech as temporary chairman. His
address was a review of the accom
plishments *of the present administra
tion and a defense of Republican pol
icies in general. When that had been
delivered and the various working com
mittees dispatched to their labors the
business of to-day's session was com
pleted.
CROWD NOT A NOISY ONE.
State pride figured strongly in the
convention. Each State had its friends
in the galleries, who showered plau
dits upon their delegation as they en
tered the Coliseum. The floor filled
with delegates so rapidly that many
prominent figures slipped . in unno
ticed. Among these was Senator Lodge,
who is accredited with having a more
intimate knowledge of what the con
vention Is doing than any other man.
Before the gathering was called to or
der by Postmaster General Payne,
chairman of the Republican National
Committee, Senator Lodge moved
about among the delegations and his
ear was sought continually by embry
onic platform makers. The Massa
chusetts Senator never stopped long
enough, however, to grow intimate.
The first epeech of the convention
The picture was one of good order,
where sergeants at arms and police
men were not needed.
â¢ The Fairbanks boom for the Vice
Presidency flourished unrestricted
during the convention proceedings. It3
impetus was gained when the Indiana
delegation .entered the Coliseum and.
led by the two Senators, Fairbanks
and Beverldge,* proceeded ! down - the
aisle to their seats near the stage. The
ovation given Senator Fairbanks was
greater ] than was ! received "by any of
his distinguished colleagues. â¢
, To-day's proceedings afforded no
opportunity for the advancement of
other candidates. No mention was
made of the names of favorite sons
whose ambitions are not taken seri
ously beyond the boundaries of their
own States. The applause for Sena
tor Fairbanks appeared to be general.
The placidity of political opponents
as they sat in the. hall, welded into a
substantial party citizenship unani
mously agreeing on principles and dif
fering only on non-essentials, was one
of the features of the convention. The
New York delegation, which occupied
a position of honor directly in front of
the platform, supplied a good example
of the -prevailing harmony. On the
opposite side of the center aisle, in
equal command of the platform, was
the Illinois delegation, which had a
bitter ficht within its ranks as late
as yesterday. To-day, if any soreness
remained, to all outward appearances
It had been healed.

CORTELYOU'S RECORD CLEAR.
To-day's programme of" the conven
tion was not of a nature to attract
more than ordinary interest. The mat

senting to the convention of the propo
sition to admit the delegations from
the Philippine Islands and Porto Rico.
Root asked for a ruling on the ques
tion of calling names of the new pos
sessions in the roll for the naming of
members of the various .'committees.
The convention ordered the seating and
recognition of six delegates from the
Philippines, with two votes, and two
delegates from Porto Rico.
In the convention hall to-day there
was one woman delegate, who had the
same right to vote that was held by
each accredited male delecate. She was

presented to Chairman Payne a beauti

The La Follette men declined to

Aroused by the charges contained In

granted a request of the Spooner men
that they be given a hearing for the
purpose of clearing themselves of the
charges made by their opponents. The

After listening to the arguments by
counsel for the "stalwarts" for an
hour and a half the chairman, by di

The La Follette faction of the Wis
consin Republicans declined to make a
contest before the credentials commit
tee this afternoon, declaring that it re
fused to do \so on the ground that the
committee on credentials was not an
unprejudiced body and making the flat
statement that it understood that some
members of the committee had been
"approached." What the nature of the
"approach" might be, , . or by whom
made, the La Follette men declined to
state. They entered into no particu
lars, simply making the broad and
general charge of an "approach," and
withdrew.
CHICAGO, June 21.â The credentials
committee organized for work at 4
o'clock, with Senator JlcComas of
Maryland in the chair. By unanimous
vote the committee upheld the action of

the J. Edward Addicks delegation from
Delaware entitled to seats in the con
vention.
The anti-Addicks faction, through its
attorney, charged that Addicks had at
different times used $390,000 to obtain
the election of his lieutenants and In
the effort to elect himself United States
Senator.
Addicks arose to a question of per
sonal privilege and emphatically de
nied the charge. He was not permitted
to make a speech, however, but replied
to questions from the committee.
The, fight between the contesting del
egates at larsre from Louisiana -was

by the decision, of the committee to

Fashion in Crime.
It would appear from the report for
last year of the Prison Commissioners
for Scotland that drunkenness in that
country is yielding before the superior
attractions of burglary. From 1902 to
1903 the commitments for trifling delin
quencies fell from 55,120 to 48,956,
whereas those for serious offenses
rose from 10,601 to 11,120. Certain pre
sumptuous persons have hazarded the
theory that the high proportion of of
fenders, which, in the northern king
dom, declined to avail itself of the "op
tion" had relation to natural charac
teristics, if it was not, indeed, due to
the fact that the Scotchman, much as
he disliked going to prison, disliked
parting with his money more. The
commissioners now point out that in
Ireland more than half the fines im
posed are less than 6 shillings, which
probably accounts for 81 per cent of
them being paid. In Scotland, on the
other hand, where only 45 per cent were
paid, more than half are of 10 shillings
and upward.â Lojjdon. Telegraph.

Â¦ Why does^ Japan object to the Rus
sian annexation of Kor"ea? â¢
Because Japan is overcrowded with
a population twelve times as dense as
that of the United States and it seeks
an outlet for its immigrants on the
mainland. The island empire has
hoped, too, to make Korea the base of
an attempt to extend Japanese influ
ence throughout China. Furthermore,
it now conducts nine-tenths of Ko
rea's commerce and owns, Korea's two
railways. Its trade and railways
would both be threatened and proba
bly deprived of value. in the event of
Russia's success. And, finally, i Japan

would be menaced were Russia to gain
the harbor at the end of the Korean
peninsula almost within cannon range
of the Japanese island fortress of
Tsushima. " â<
Does Japan want to annex Korea?-
No. It is satisfied to maintain
Korea's sovereignty, with the expecta

Not especially. It is a purely agri
cultural land, and the methods of cul
tivation are primitive. A few gold
mines are operated and there are
supposed to be deposits -of copper,
iron and coal.
1 Why, then, does Russia want
Korea?
Chiefly because of Its position.
Korea is an extension of Manchuria,
which, practically belongs to Russia.
In the natural development of con-,
tiguous territory Russian merchants
have crossed the boundary into Korea
and Russian interests accumulating
there under the weak native govern
ment naturally look to the Czar for
protection.
Why is Korea of, strategic value to
Russia?

of understanding exactly what the

"A. B. C." of the situation:
What is the trouble in the Far
East?
Japan is trying to keep Russia out
of Korea.
What is Korea and where is it sit
uated?
Korea is an autocracy under Japan
ese influence, about as large as Kan
sas, with a population estimated at
between eight and sixteen millions.
The empire occupies a peninsula just
south of Siberia, jutting into the Pa
cific Ocean between the Yellow Sea
and the Sea of Japan, and reaching
within less than one hundred miles of
the southern end of Japan.

The Reason Why Japan and

in the Game of War
HONOLULU, June 15.â Bishop Res
tarlck of the Anglican church believes
there is less harm in Mormon polyg
amy than arises through the divorce
laws of the. States. In a paper read
before the Social Science Club here,
after instancing the case of a man who
has secured three divorces within a
v^ry few years and had been married
a fourth time, the Bishop said:
"This man, and there are thousands
like him. was enabled under law to
wreck life after life because he could
be freed from the bond of marriage
more easily than he could be freed
from the most trivial business con
tract, and he is permitted to marry
as often as he pleases and so to be
what may be called a -consecutive
polygamist.'
"There is a great cry now being
made against a Senator, because he be
longs to a sect which believes in
polygamy, as there was a short time
ago about preventing a. polygamous
Congressman from taking his seat. I
deliberately believe that Mormon
polygamy is less debasing to the in
dividual and less harmful to Boclety
than. the kind of polygamy practiced
by. thousands in many vt our States.
The polygamist husband supports his
wives and children, the consecutive
polygamist divorces wife after. wife as
the fancy takes him, and leaves the
deserted ones to support themselves
and their children, or leaves them to
become a charge upon the public, his
children often becoming inmates of
cl/ldren's homes."

of the Red Cross in attending to the
wounded under ' fire was beyond all
praise. One Red Cross assistant was
killed and another was wounded.
The Tobolsk Regiment saved the last
hospital train from Vafangow by gal
lantly throwing itself between the train
and a superior force of Japanese and
by holding off the enemy while the
train was under a heavy fire.
Shell fire burned the Red Cross sta

NEW YORK,. JunÂ« 21.â The World
has the following from St.- Petersburg:
"The Gazette announces that there has
been a sanguinary battle at Haicheng.
The Russians retreated with heavy
losses."
ST. PETERSBURG. June 21.â The
reports of heavy fighting at Haicheng
are denied by the general staff. The
Japanese are continuing to advance
from Siuyen and there are continuous
skirmishes between outposts, but no
further advance of General Oku's army
has been reported. ; Â¦''- . '%.
The Russian losses at the battle, of
Vafangow are turning out to be heav

by a conservative estimate at 4000, but
a usually well-informed authority ex

CHEFU, June 21, 10 p. m.â Officers of
the United States collier Brutus, while
passing eighty miles north of Shanghai,
state that they saw four Japanese tor
pedo-boats and one cruiser firing, on
Saturday night. In the morning the
Japanese vessels were still visible, but
there was no sign of the enemy.
The Russians, " having done every
thing possible to save, the lives of
those on board, discharged two tor
pedoes against the vessel. A heavy
squall broke at that time and hid the
sinking transport from view. A three*
masted Japanese cruiser witnessed the
whole affair. The Russians caught her
wireless messages. The apparatus of
the enemy's cruiser worked incessant-

. The Japanese transport Sado, which
was sunk by the squadron, carried
1360 coolies, for railroad work in
Korea, 1200 tons of coal, 1000 tons
of rice, railroad and telegraph equip
ment,, 100 horses and a large amount
of specie. The specie was thrown
overboard by" the purser. Besides
ten boats, the Sado carried twelve
rafts, each capable of carrying
100 men. - As soon as the crew was
ordered to leave the ship the coolies
rushed on deck, filled the boats and
headed them for the coast. Admiral
Bezobrazoff sent boats to the Sado to
take oft* the captain and officers. Cap

and three Englishmen in the Japanese
service came, the others refusing to
leave the ship. -"
Vladivostok, June 21.â Lying in
the harbor are the three Russian
cruisers which have just returned from
their successful raid in the Japan Sea
and Straits of Korea. Vice Admiral
Bezobrazoff took the squadron out
June 12. The first day the warships
were fogbound. They reached the
Korean Straits June 15 and were
sighted and watched by a fast three
masted Japanese cruiser. Off Tau
Island the Russians pursued a vessel
resembling a yacht, which escaped in
shore. . ' .
"On board the Allanton was found a
Japanese subject of the educated class.

On the following day in the Tsugaru
strait our squadron stopped the British
steamer Allanton.' Her captain de
clared to the efflcers not to examine
her, that he was proceeding from Mu

coal. An examination of the crew and
inspection of the ship's papers and cer
tain irregularities in ': the log, coupled
with the fact that the steamer had pre
viously conveyed contrabands to Japan,
led us to doubt the neutrality of her
cargo and she was sent to Vladivostok
under guard. There her case will be
examined by a prize court.

WASHINGTON, June 21.â Assistant
Secretary of State Loomis has been
notified by the officials of the steam
ship company that his brother, Kent
Loomis, who was e:i route to Europe,
has disappeared from the Kaiser Wil
lselm II.
Loomis. however, is confident that
his brother has r.ot come to harm. His
reason for this belief is the fact that
when the boat touched at Plymouth,
which was during the night, his
brother landed, as was sho'.vn by the
dispatch by him of a cablegram which
was recei\fd in Washington. Loomis
thinks his brother was accidentally left
in Plymouth when the boat departed
for Cherbourg. He is expecting to hear
from him a.t any moment.
Loomis has received several dis
patches from persons who were aboard
the Kaiser Wilhelm II, saying they
eaw his brother get off the ship when
she touched at Plymouth at 2 o'clock
Monday morning. These dispatches
came from passengers who landed at
Cherbourg and subsequently went to
Paris. The information they, contain
confirms Mr. Loomis in his opinion that
his brother simply took advantage of
an opportunity to nuke a stop for a
time in England. He declares that
there is absolutely no occasion for
alarm about his brother.

From an Atlantic Liner
NEW YORK, June 21.â Evidence of
a startling nature, which doubtless
will have a mosl important bearing on
the ultimate result of the Coroner's in
quiry into the General Slocum disaster,
was forthcoming at the inquest to-day.
Perhaps . the most unexpected inci
dent was the* continued refusal Jto
answer questions of Henry Lund
berp, a United States steamboat
inspector, who was supposed to
have inspected the life preservers and
the hull of the Slocum. His refusal
was based on the ground that an an
swer might tend to incriminate him
and he acted on the advice of his coun
sel.
The 'Coroner committed Lundberg to
the House of Detention, but later ac
cepted/$500 bail for his appearance at
the hearing to-morrow, which was sat
isfactory to the Assistant District At
torney. V
Second Pilot Weaver of the Slocum
testified that he had purchased the fire
hose for that boat and Garvan. intro
duced evidence to show that the price
paid was 40 cents a foot, less 60 per
cent, or 16 cents per fopt net.
"Don't you know that you can't buy
good fire hose for less than a dollar or
a dollar and a half a foot?"
'-"I don't know anything about the
price of hose." responded Weaver.
Weaver also declared that there had
been no fire drill -en the Slocum this
year.
Daniel O'Neill, who, according to his
sworn statement, had never worked on
a boat until he was hired on the Slo
cum a short time ago, admitted that
he had jumped into a rowboat filled
with people from the Slocum, capsizing
it. Asked if he saved any one, he said
there Â« were others doing that and he
was not an expert swimmer. He swam
ashore himself, however. O'Neill de
clared he never saw a fire drill on the
boat. Â¦: 'Â¦_ ''Â¦'Â¦Â¦
Referring to the efforts to throw wa
ter on the lire when It was first discov
ered. O'Neill told of the bursting of
the hose. He ran and got the rubber
washing hose, but the coupling would
not fit the sandpipe. This was some of
the sensational testimony brought out.
By the use of dynamite and heavy
guns fired by men from the Second
Battery scores of bodies were* brought
up from the bottom around the shores
near North Brother Island to-day.
From sunrise to sunset the searcliera
along the beach and in the boats gath
ered in 112 bodies, bringing up the
number of the recovered to date to the
appalling total of 845. Of these, 700
have 'been identified, and the missing
still are approximated at something
more than 300. Many of the bodies last
found never will be identified because
of the changes that have taken place
during the week they have been under
the water.

what was supposed to be the body of
a boy lying ort the beach. After re

that her name was Nina Baker and
that her father lived at Williams. Co

she tried to drown herself in the

a secret and without beir.g accompan

Montrose Treadwell. widow of James
Treadwell. was married this' afternoon
to Dr. Walter C HaH of Petaluma.
Th?, ceremony was performed at the
residence of Rev. liobert Mclntyre. D.

by people living in "he neighborhood of
th(* minister's home.
Dr. Hal! and Mrs. Tread we!! arrived
in lxis Angeles last night and register
ed at the Hollenbeck. They did not
indicate that they knew each other; in
fact, the doctor stated to certain ac
quaintances here that he had no
mends here frum a distance. Shortly
before noon to-day they entered a
hack, went to the County Clerk's of
fice and secured a license. They then
repaired to the residence of Dr. Mcln

to be married.
The reverend gentleman suggested
that witnesses were necessary and the
< ouple stated that they had nobody
â¢who could act in that capacity and
Â«*ked him to send for neighbors. He
did so and the ceremony was duly per
formed. He was paid $25 for his ser

HANFORD. June 21.â As the result
of a family feud that has been brewing
for the past year or two. Thomas Jack
son Alrorn, a well-to-do farmer resld-
Ing seven miles north of this city, lies
dead, and Amos Burton Brooks, a
neighbor, is confined in the county Jail.
Tee two men met in front of Alcorn's
residence shortly before 4 o'clock to
day, ard a moment later Alcorn lay
dead near by. According to Brooks'
story. Alcorn attacked him with a large
knife and monkey-wrench and he shot
him in self-defense, while, on the other
hand. Alcorn's relatives, although ndtie
cf them saw the shooting affray, state
that evidently Brooks simply pulled
out his gun and commenced shooting
when he saw Alcorn.
Ernest Lee was the only oye-wltneaa
to the shooting, and It has been im
possible to find him to secure his ac
count of the killing. The only evidence
at hand is circumstantial. This seems
to be slightly in favor of Brooks, as
the knife s and wrench were found in
the road where the shooting: took p!ate.
Tbe offerers also found a whip, which
Is said to belong to P.rooks. lying near
the plow Vith which Alcorn was work

fusion arose that the names as called
could not be heard.
Speaker Cannon asked unanimous
consent, that as soon as a State was
called its list of committeemen be sent 1
to the clerk's desk without being read
in the convention. -The motion of Mr.
Cannon was adopted and almost in
stantly the assemblage lost all resem
blance to a convention. The galleries
began to empty, the delegates mingled
on the floor and Mr. Root was sur
rounded by a group of. chatting friends,
while messengers forced their way
through 'the crowd to collect the com
mittee lists. . k
Several; -Impromptu receptions oc
curred -in :. various parts of the hall.
Speaker Cannon, in the Illinois delega

Chauncey. M. Depew was fairly routed
out of his seat by the number of dele
gates who pressed around him. The
galleries, not full: a't any time during
the session, were three-fourths empty
by the time the list of committeemen
had been prsented.
Delegate Thomas of Illinois, after
introducing a resolution which he
wished to so to the committee on res
olutions without being read, made a
motion that the convention adjourn.
Nobody paid any attention to his mo
tion and he withdrew it a few moments
later.
' A few raps from the chairman s gavel

Ex-Senator Mason of Illinois present

were read to the convention.
Senator Depew presented to the con
vention an invitation from the Louis

A long paragraph was adopted in re
lation to reciprocity after a very excit
ing and protracted contest by a bare
majority. Several votes were taken on
this subject and it was reconsidered
two or three times before being finally
agreed to. It is a declaration for "com
mercial reciprocity, which is possible
only under a protective tariff and
RECIPROCITY PARAGRAPH.
The plank declares "for the cardinal
principles of protection," and, further,
that the "rate of duty should be the
difference between the cost of produc
tion in the United States and abroad.
The rates of duty should be readjusted
only when conditions have so changed
that the public interests demand it. All
such changes should be made by the
Republican party."
The tariff plank was finally agreed
upon, after an especially strong reit
eration of -the Republican policy of
protection, announcing a willingness to
change the schedules "wherever busi
ness conditions demand the change,"
but the opinion Us expressed that all
changes should be along protection
lines.
CHICAGO, June 22.â The sub-com

When the sub-committee met. Sena
tor Lodge for the first time presented
his draft of a platform, saying that It
was intended largely as a basis for ac
tion by the committee. His draft in
cluded a plank strongly commending
the established Republican policy on
the tariff and presenting in terse lan
guage the necessity for maintaining the
protective policy in the interest of
American labor and American indus
tries. There was a mild declaration on
the subject of reciprocity and a pro
nouncement against trusts, but with
a reservation In the interest of "estab
lished, legitimate Industries." In this
connection it congratulated the party
upon legislation on the trust question
which had been enacted since Roose

The opposition to the reciprocity
plank was led by Blythe of Iowa, Rep
resentative Dal?ell and Senator Hans
brough, while Senator Lodge and Sen
ator Foraker persisted in an effort to
secure the declaration.
Lodge's draft did not contain any
declaration on the subject of the ar
bitration of the Canadian boundary
question, but other members of the
committee suggested a plank cover-
Ing that point, the remark being made
that the fact that Senator Lodge had
been a member of that commission
should not stand In the way of a
proper presentation of it, in view of
its -importance.
John M. Switzer, a delegate to the.
convention from Cebu, P. I., and a
member of the committee on â¢ cre
dentials, submitted to the committee
a draft of a plank favoring reduction
and ultimate free trade between the
United States and the Philippine
Islands. The sub-committee's decision
was adverse to the proposition as a
part of the platform.
The original draft of the platform
contained no reference to the question
of polygamy and at a late hour the
question had not been taken up by
the committee. Senator Smoot says
that there will be no utterance what
ever concerning It.

As soon as the meeting adjourned
Ruef hurried to the headquarters of the
Ruef then stepped forward and an
nounced that he was unalterably op
posed to any action on the part of the
delegation looking toward its an
nouncement in favor of any candidate
until it could be ascertained beyond
doubt that it was not committing itself
to a policy that developments might
prove unwise. He said he had ascer
tained that the delegates had been led
astray by the newspapers of the East,
and announced that he favored the ex
ercise cf Individual intelligence in this
mfcst important question! He asked
that the motion be withdrawn until ar
fuller Investigation could be made.
Governor Pardee insisted that his mo
tion be put. but Ruef's logic had had
Jt& effect. Eleven of the delegates voted
against the measure and It was de
feated.
Roofs reference, earlier In his speech,
to the checking, through the extension
of forest reserves, of further denuda
tion of forest areas, which produced
alternate floods and dryness In our
river valleys, also struck home to Cali
fornia. It won frem her delegates a
tribute to the distinguished speaker in
the acknowledgment that his address
contained the best outline of national
progress yet uttered by a statesman.
These were the only subjects that
came before the convention to-day that
were of greater importance to Califor
nia than to her sister States, but her
delegation looks for more to-morrow.
Fairbanks of Indiana was indorsed to
day for Vice President by the Califor
nia delegation, but not until after a
contest had been waged that gave to
Ruef of San Francisco a victory. His
judgment in this important matter
prevailed over that of the acknowl
edged leaders of the California delega
tion and has given him a lift as a factor
in the national game.
When the California delegation met
this morning at 10:30 o'clock Chairman
McKinley announced that in his opin
ion it was advisable that the delega
tion announce its position as to its
choice for Vice President. He said he
believed the delegation should declare
in favor of Fairbanks of Indiana, and
that he would entertain a motion to
that effect. Governor Pardee rose and
after paying a* tribute to Indiana s
leading Republican moved that the del
egation declare in his favor.
George A. Knight seconded the Gov
ernor's motion and took advantage of
the opportunity to place himself on

Fairbanks' official career, but of his
private life and character.

"The earth has been searched for
'weapons with which to fight the
enemies that destroy the growing
crops," said Root. "An Insect brought
from near the great wall of China has
checked the San Jose scale, which was
destroying our orchards. A parasitic
fly brought from South Africa is ex
terminating the black scale in the
lemon and orange groves of Califor

"Three cheers for California," shout

Jose sprang up and waved his hat.
California's cheer rang 'out. It carried
inspiration. -
Enthusiasm gained control. Another
cheer from California was seconded by
the delegates of the nation when Root.
In his unanswerable defense of the pol

the western to the eastern sea, said:
"And now the greatest of the con

the dreams of past ages, bind together

Root's tribute to the horticultural
wealth of the domain on the nation's
western rim awakened every atom of
hdtent patriotism In the breasts of the
Californians. .
With a shout they rose to acknowl
edge they had heard his words. The
enthusiasm was caught by the multi

No shout of commendation struck
harder against the giant arches of the
Coliseum to-day than that of Califor

his masterful speech at the opening of

Upon the adjournment of the con

gates returned to headquarters, and
then began a reception which the old
est statesmen in the party say was
never equaled at a national gather

California has profited more by this
convention than any other State in
the nation. The flavor of her fruits is
no-w known to the most distinguished
men of the 'country, as is the richness
of her winea and the bouquet of her
brandies. The next chairman of Cali
fornia's commission to a world's fair
should be Fulton G. Berry of Fresno.
While the delegates were doing poli
tics. Berry was doing wonders. He
was piloting America's biggest men to
the headquarters, and as they tasted
of the fruits and sipped the wines, he
told in eloquent diction of the re
sources of the Golden State. Visitors
that have arrived here from the world's
fair say this feature of the national
convention will do as much good for
California as her great exhibit at the
exposition grounds.
Senator Fairbanks. Speaker Cannon.
Congressman Littlefield, Chauncey M.
Deprw and Governor Odell were among
the distinguished visitors at the Cali
fornia headquarters to-day.
JOKE ON" THE GOVERNOR.
CALIFORNIA'S FAME SPREADS.
New York delegation and was soon in
consultation with Governor Odell and
other leaders of the party. Governor
Odell Informed Ruef that the New York
delegation had abandoned its opposition
to Fairbanks, and that if California
declared in his favor It would be with
the majority of the convention.
When the California delegation re
assembled at 11 o'clock to march to the
convention hall Ruef made known the
result of his investigations. He then,
made a motion that the delegation de
clare in favor of Fairbanks. The mo
tion was put and unanimously carried.
Chauncey M. Depew was the recipient
of a heartv welcome as he came
through the main entrance on the west
side of the building. The Senator
walked down toward the platform en
tirely obliviouB of a doorkeeper, who
did not know him and was entering to
learn if be was properly entitled to the
privileges of the hall. Half-way up to
the seats of the New York delegation,
just in the left center of the left plat
form, the Senator was overtaken and
made to deliver.
Close behind the New York Senator
came the senior Senator of Illinois,
Shelby M. Cullom. The men from Illi
nois who were in the balcony did not
see their Senator, and he was given
only a slight handdapping from those
on the main floor who knew him. Sen
ator Cullom sought the seats of the Illi
nois delegation without greeting.
Following closely upon Senators Cul
lom and Depew came "Uncle Joe" Can
non, a black felt hat jammed down on
his head. He was walking back and
forth in the crowd in front of the plat
form without attracting attention save
for a few handshakes from Washington
friends. When he removed his hat the
recognition by the galleries was simul
taneous, and the Speaker was warmly
greeted by the galleries and delegates.
By 11:45 o'clock each entrance to the
main floor of the great hall was pour
ing In a stream of delegates. They
came quietly, few delegates arriving In
a body. Mingling with the strains of
the band was a great hum of conversa
tion, but there was no disorder. The
hall filled rapidly, but the galleries were
slower, and ten minutes before the
hour set for the presiding officer's
gavel to fall there was. a wilderness of
vacant chairs in the great balconies.
A few minutes before 12 o'clock the
Coliseum resounded with a burst of ap
plause. It was the greeting to Henry
C. Payee, the chairman, and Elihu
Senator Allison acknowledged the re
epption with a smile and bow, but the
junior Senator apparently did not real
ize that he was being honored, for he
turned his back upon his friends in
the gallery while they were still ap
plauding him, and walked slowly back
to the seats In the crowd. Throughout
the time that elapsed between the
opening of the doors and that set for
the formal opening of the convention
an orchestra in a bandstand raised
high above the gallery at the south end
of the hall rendered patriotic music,
alternated with popular airs of the
day.
WELCOME FOR DEPEW.
Few delegates and alternates and
practically none of the men prominent
in the control of the Republican party
had put in an appearance at the hall
si 11 o'clock. An array of doorkeepers
was on guard at the various entrances,
and numerous bodies of sergeants-at
arms were stationed at the commence
ment, middle and ends of the aisles to
guide the delegates to their seats.
The last touches to the hall had been
made in the night and early morning.
Palms and potted plants were placed
around the sides of the hall in the
first floor and arches and boughs, which
were fastened to the girders Just above
the upper balcony, relieved in a pleas
ant manner the long stretch of saffron
colored roofing. It had been announced
tbat the only picture which would be
seen in the convention hall would be
the portrait of the late Senator Hanna,
which hung Just above the Speaker's
platform, but yesterday large engrav
ings of President Roosevelt were
placed, one at every alternate catch
in the draped bunting that stretched
around the ceiling. Below each picture
of the President and beneath those
fo'.ds in the draped streamers of red.
Â¦white and blue where the picture was
not hung were swinging baskets pf
ferns, while the under side of the great
trusses from the bunting to the back*
of the seats was covered with taste
fully arranged palms.
The first applause to the incoming
delegates was a ripple of handclaps
from the gallery given to Senator Al
lison of Iowa. Senator Do'.liver of Iowa
came strolling down the center aisle
closely after Senator Allison had taken
his seat, and the men in the gallery
from Iowa broke out into applause a
eecond time.
For hours before and during the ses-
Fion of the conver.tic-n the hotels. were
vacant. The large rooms occupied by
State headquarters, decorated with tri
colored cloth and the pictures of dis
tinguished sons, both living and dead,
were quite empty since the early m>>rn
ing conference.
FEW EARLY ARRIVALS.
CHICAGO, June 21.â The Republican
National Convention, the thirteenth in
the party's history, met In the Coli
tcum at noon to-day and organized.
The grand climax, the nominations.
will not be reached until the third day.
Senator Depew calls to-day the cur
tain raiser for the more serious drama
of to-morrow and Thursday. The cur
tain raiser was in itself a,n absorbing
production. Weather predictions were
disturbing. There was a suggestion of
rain in the air ar.d the sun had a
struggle all the" morning with clouds
banked up over the lake. Fresh breezes
from the northwest cooled the tem
perature, but indoors, out of reach^ of
the breeze, the day was hot. Five
acres of seats under the arches of the
Coliseum began to fill by half past ten
o'clock. Black dots appeared in the
emptiness, the videttes of that huge
assemblage which presently shaped
into the convention. The interest that
hafl for two days eddied gently around
OCtJT State or Territorial headquarters
concentrated upon these five steel cov
ered acres, or ratht-r upon that frag
ment of an acre of delegates' chairs,
painted green, in front of a crimson
carpeted rostrum set with Flemish oak
furniture. The table was a solid piece
lit to stand the blows to be beat upon
It. As thin lines of delegates and other
ticket holders entered from many en
trances, the watrhers outside grew into
a multitude and some hearts burned
over fruitless plannlngs for admission.
But most of those outside were satis
fied with the miid thrill of being in
the neighborhood of where large things
vere to be done, for the first sessiyn of
the national convention was an impos
ing fact, even if its general results
were certainties beforehand.
Under the rostrum and stretching
the whole lenpth of the basement was
one of the most curious eights of the
conventionâ the paraphernalia and the
workers who communicated to the mil
lions what the thousands saw. Into
this space was let hundreds of wires,
more than 500. that connected the hall
with the principal newspapers ef the
country and with the agencies that
transmit news over seas. More than
100 telephones were working and up
ward of 400 telegraph instruments. A
thousand reporters, operators and mes-
Fenpers manned this intelligence ma
chine. â¢

Chairman Payne recognized Gov
ernor Van Sant of Minnesota to pre

officer.
When he reached the signature of
the call, "M. A. Hanna," the conven
tion broke into spontaneous applause
and cheers.
All nations are thy children. Guide and
keep them by thy gracious providence and
hasten the coming of the day when love shall
have conquered hate and war* ehall have
ceased and all people shall dwell together in
unity. For thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory forever. Amen.
GAVEL. FOR CHAIRMAN" PAY'XE.
SenatoiKScott, on behalf of the Chi
cago eftlzens' committee, which co
operated with the national committee
of arrangements for the convention,
then presented National Chairman
Henry C. Payne with a handsome
gavel. It was large and made for busi
ness*. A heavy gold band was Inscribed:
"Mr. Henry C. Payne, Chairman Re
publican National Committee, 1904."
Mr. Payne expressed his appreciation
of the sift, and at once announced that
Secretary Elmer X>over of the national
committee would read the call of the
convention. Mr. Dover delegated
Mr. Mallory of Ohio, one of the read-
Ing clerks, to do the reading. As he
read a band played on the outside, to
some extent drowning the voice of the
clerk-
Rless thy servant, the chief magistrate of
our nation. May he and all others clothfd
with authority by the sovereign people be pro
tecu.d by the power of thy kingdom and con
tribute to its ultimate triumph and consum
mation in all the earth.
V*> pray thee to overrule the deliberations,
conclusions and Issues of this convention for
the good of the American people and the wel
fare of mankind.
Save our nation, we beseech thee, from all
the evil things which defile the home, impair
civil liberty, corrupt politics or undermine the
integrity of commercial life. Bring to naught
the schemes of men who would debauch or
OFprr^s human life for the gratification of lust
or for perronal enrichment or power. May
exaltation come only to men who despise thÂ«
fcaln of oppressions and vhake the hands from
holding of bribes. May all section* and races,
all creeds and sentiments, all occupations and
interests become united through the spirit of
the hirhest into a citienzshlp with a passion
for righteousness, wherein each individual
Â»hal| lock up to God an the' father of all and
on every man as a brother.
Almighty God, our hÂ«>lp in ages past our
hoi* for years to come, w* thank the* for
thy goodness to the people of this land. Our
Kins have b^n man}-, but thy mercies have
been treat. Thou haÂ«t poured out thy gifts
without measure. The opening years of a new
crntury have been freighted with wealth for
hand and mind and heart. Best of all thou
art giving thyself in a perpetual offering: of
thy life for the life of man. We do not forget
that In the hour of deep sorrow when the
heart of the- nation was darkened by the
murder of the nation's chief there was no
break fn the march of thy purpose, the or
derly administration of our Government or the
faith of the people in their God. Under the
guidance of thy holy spirit we have been
brought by our national woes nearer to thee.
Purely thou wilt never forsake this people.
May no dominance of greed, no riot of pas-
Fion. no weakening of religious conviction or
enthronement of matter over spirit cause thÂ«
people to forsake thee. May the heritage of.
honor coming to us from the fathers in mem
ories of ncble sacrifices and valiant deeds be
at once nur glad :>oÂ«session and our sacred
trust. While we are grateful for the past,
may we remember that to-day is better than
yesUrday. and fo act that the morrow shall
be greater than to-day. V.'herever our coun
try's flag floats as the symbol of government,
ew-n unto the isles of the sea, may we cleave
unto the righteousness that sealeth a nation
and cast out the tin that is a reproach to any
people.
With three severe raps of the gavel
Chairman Payne called the convention
to order at 12:16. He then introduced
Rev. Timothy Frost, pastor of tho
First Methodist Church of Evanston.
III., who pronounced the opening
prayer. He said:
The place behind the platform was
reserved for distinguished guests and
among those who occupied these seats
were Senators Alger, Charles Emory
Smith, General Grosvenor. Murat Hal
sted, Mrs. John A. Logan. William
Alden Smith. Jesse Overstreet, Secre
tary Shaw, Minister to Panama Bar

and Mrs. Alger.
OPENED WITH PRAYER.
There was a small crowd outside
the hall. The arrangements were
such that delegates and spectators
were rapidly admitted and in an or
derly manner. A few bands that had
led the marching clubs played outside
the entrance, but no especial demon
stration was made by the small crowd
of spectators who were In the street.
Some difficulty was exp>rienced in
seating the delegations and the con
vention noon hour found Chairman
Payne, gavel in hand, waiting pa
tiently for the delegations to find their
places before calling the convention
to order. Shortly after noon special
messengers were sent through the
large hall in the effort to'get the dele
gates seated.
Loud applause greeted Senator Pen
rose of Pennsylvania as he marched
in, followed by the Pennsylvania dele
gation, which was one of the last to
arrive.
Another prominent arrival at this
moment- was ex-Governor Black of
New York. The Alaskan delegation,
carrying totem poles mounted with
American eagles, attracted attention
and were greeted with applause.
When the hands of the big clock
over the main entrance marked 12
o'clock the floor was filled, but the
galleries held not more than half their
capacity.
The first accident to any of the
delegations resulted in a serious in
jury to William Hodson, an alternate
from Hastings, Minn., as he was about
to enter the convention hall. Just as
he alighted from a streetcar t on the
VVabash avenue side of the building a
cab approached. The horse struck
Hodson, who was knocked down, and
the wheels of the cab passed over his
left leg just above the ankle, produc
ing a compound fracture. He was
hurried at once to the Emergency
Hospital in the annex of the Coliseum,
where his leg was set, and he was then
removed to St. Luke's Hospital. His
condition is not serious.
Root of New York, the temporary
chairman. They proceeded at once to
the platform.
As Senator Fairbanks at the head of
the Indiana delegation entered the first
ovation was tendered. A smile lit up
the face of the Senator as, amid round
after round of applause and the first
cheers to be heard, he worked his way
to the seats of the Indiana delegation,
near the platform.

gates rose at the sound as one man.
Cheers rang through the hall, and
many men sprang upon their chairs
and waved hats, banners and hand
kerchiefs.
After the applause had subsided
Chairman Payne, in a few words, ex
pressed thanks for the gavel. He then
said:
"Gentlemen of the convention: The
national committee has selected for
your temporary chairman the Hon.
Elihu Root of New York."
There was another shout from the
convention, which was prolonged when
Governor Odell of New York rose to
move that the action of the national
committee be approved.
ROOT'S WARM RECEPTION.
Applause greeted Governor Odell,
and it was some momenta before he
could put his motion. It was at onc<:
adopted by the convention. Mr.- Root
was greeted with renewed cheers as he
advanced to the speakers' stand. â¢
"Mr. Chairman," he said, "I am
deeply â " Another burst of cheering
cut him off.
â¢'I am deeply," resumed. Mr. Root,
when quiet was restored, and this time
he was permitted to proceed.
Simultaneously with ex-Secretary
Root's appearance at the speakers*
table an Immense oil painting of Presi
dent Â¦ Roosevelt -was unveiled' at his
right. .
The tableau brought forth a burst
of enthusiasm. As Mr. Root began to
speak the picture was removed and
the sole attention of the. immense
gathering was devoted to the New
York statesman. He had hardly struck
his stride when cries of "louder" were
heard from far recesses of the hall.
His voice soon gained power, however,
and his well-enunciated words rang
.through the still hall. :
Mr. Root concluded his address with
the words, "Theodore Roosevelt," and
these were magic to . the delegates.

On the 1st of March, 1SÂ»7. when the first
administration of McKinley began we. had In
the country Including bullion in the Treasury,
$1,806,272,076. This was $23.14 per capita for
our population, and of. this :;vsrÂ»:$ per cent was
gold. On the. 1st of March. 1001, when the
second administration of McKinley began, the
money in the country was $2,4G7.295,228. This
was $28.34 per capita, and of this 45.273 per
cent was goli. On the 1st of May last the
money in the country was $2,814,985,446, which
was $31.62 per capita, and of It 48.028 per cent
was geld. This great Increase of currency has
been arranged In such a way that the large
government notes In circulation are gold cer
tificates, whlie the silver certificate, and green
backs are of small denominations. A. the
large gold certificates repre.ent gold actuati
on deposit, their presentation -at -the Treasury
in exchange for gold can never infringe upon
the gold reserve. As the email silver certi
ficates and greenbacks are always In active
circulation no large 1 amount of them can be
accumulated for the purpose of drawing on
the gold reserve: and thus, while every man
can get a gold dollar for every dollar of the
Government's currency, the endless chain which
we were once taught to fear so much has been
effectively put out of business. The Secretary
of the Treasury has 6hown himself mindful of
the needs of business and has so managed our
finances as himself to expand and contract our
currency aa occasion has required. When In the
fall of 1902 tbe demand for funds to move the
crops caused extraordinary money stringency
the Secretary exercised his lawful right to ac
cept State and municipal bonds as security
for public deposits, thus . liberating United
States bonds which were used for additional
circulation. When the crops were moved and
the stringency was over he called for a with
drawal of the Hate and municipal securities,
and thus contracted tbe currency. Again, in
1903, under similar conditions, he produced
similar results. Tbe payment of the $50,000,000
for the Panama canal made last month, with
out causing the slightest disturbance in finance,
showed rood Judgment and a careful considera
tion of the Interests of business upon which
our people may confidently rely.
REGULATION OF TRUSTS.
Four years ago the regulation by. law of the
great corporate combinations called "trusts"
stood substantially where it ' was when ! the
Sherman anti-trust act of 1S90 was passed.

December, 1896. had Bald: Â¦ " â¢ Â¦ . *

INCREASE OF WEALTH
Between the 30th of June, 1900. and the 1st
of June. 1904. our Treasury Department col
lected in revenues the enormous sum of $2,203,
000,000 and expended $2 02S.000.000, leaving us
with a surplus of over $170,000,000 after paying
the $50,000,000 for the Panama canal and loan
ing St.OOo.ix.O to the St. Louis Exposition.
Excluding those two extraordinary payments,
which are investments from past surplus and
not expenditures of current income, the sur
plus for this year will be the reasonable
amount of about $12,000,000.
The vast and complicated transactions of the
Treasury, which for the last fiscal year show
actua.1 cash receipts of $4,250,290,262 and dis
bursements of $4,113,199,414, have been' con
ducted with perfect accuracy and fidelity and
without the loss of a dollar. Under wise
management the financial act of March 14,
1900. which embodied the sound financial prin
ciples of the Republican party and provided for
the maintenance of our currency on the stable
basis of the gold standard, has wrought out
beneficial results. On the 1st of November.
1893. the Interest-bearing debt of the United
States was $l.W6.O49.020. On the 1st of May
last the amount of that debt was $893,157,440,
a reduction of $150,891,580. By refunding the
annual Interest has been still more rapidly re
duced from $40,347,884 on the 1st of November,
1S39, to $24,176,745 on the 1st of June," 1904.
an annual saving of over $1C,COO COO. When
the financial act was paused the thinly settled
portions of our country were, suffering for lack
of banking facilities because the banks were
In the* large towns, and none could be organized
with capital of 1Â»-sb than $50,000. Under the
provisions of that act there were organized
down to the 1st of May last 1296 small banks of
$25,000 capital, furnishing, under all the safe
guards of the national banking system, facili
ties to the small communities of the W r est and
South. The facilities made possible by that
act have increased the circulation of national
banks from $254,402,730 on the 14th of March
1900. to $445,988,565 on the 1st of June, 19Ot!
The money of the country in circulation has
not only Increased In amount with our growth
In business, but it has steadily gained in the
ktablllty of the basis on which it rests.
Four vears ago the business of the country
was loaded with burdensome Internal taxes.
Imposed during the war with Spain. By the
acts of March 2, 1901. and April 12. 1902, the
country has been wholly relieved of that an

THE POSTAL SERVICE.
The postal service has been extended and Im
proved. Its revenues have Increased from $76 -
000,000 in 1805 to $95,000,000 In 1899, and $144.-
C0O.00O In 1004. In dealing with these vast
sums a few cases of peculation, trifling in
amount and by subordinate officers, have oc
curred there as they occur In every business.
Neither fear nor favor, nor political for per
sonal Influence has availed to protect the wrong,
doers. Their acts have been detected* Investi
gated, laid bare; they have been dismissed
from their places, prosecuted criminally -In
dicted, many of them tried, and many of them
convicted. The abuses In the carriage of
second-class mail matter have been remedied.
The rural Ire* delivery "has been wMely ex

master General declared It Impracticable. Â¦ The
first administration of McKinley proved the
contrary. â¢ At the beginning of the fiscal year

cattle against infection from abroad; .and has
established the highest credit for our meat pro
ducts in the markets of the world. The earth
has been searched for weapons with which to
flght the enemies that destroy the â¢ growing
crops. An insect brought from near the Great
Wall of China has checked the San Jose scale
which .was destroying our orchards: a parasitic
fly brought from South Africa is exterminating
the black scale In tho lemon and orange groves
of California; and an ant from Guatemala Is
about offering battle to the boll weevil. Broad
science has been brought to the aid of limited
experience. Study of the relations between
plant life and climate and soil has been fol
lowed by the introduction of special crops
milted to -our varied conditions. The Intro
duction of Just the right kind of seed -has en
abled the Gulf States-to Increase our rice. crop

deemed a hopeless part of the arid belt. â¢
We have at last reached a point where the
public wealth of farm land which has seemed
so inexhaustible is nearly gone, and the prob
lem of utilizing the remainder for the building
of new homes has become of vital importance.
The present administration has dealt with
this problem vigorously and effectively. Great
areas had been unlawfully fenced in by men of
large means, and the bome-bullder had been
excluded. Many of these unlawful aggressors
have been compelled to relinquish their booty,
and more than 2.000,000 acres of land have
been restored to the public. Extensive frauds
In procuring grants of land, not for home
steads but for speculation, have been Investi
gated and stopped, and the perpetrators have
been Indicted and are being actively prosecuted.
A competent commission has been constituted
to examine Into the defective working of the
existing laws and to suggest practical legisla
tion to prevent further abuse. That commis
sion has reported, and bills adequate to accom
plish the purpose have been framed and are be
fore Congress. The further denudation of for
est areas, producing alternate floods and dry
ness in our river valleys, has been checked by
the extension of forest reserves, which have
been brought to aggregate more than 63.000.000
acres of land. The reclamation by irrigation
of tho vast arid regions forming the chief part
of our remaining public domain has been pro
vided for by the national reclamation law of
June 17, 1903. The execution of this law,
without taxation and by the application of the
proceeds of public land sales alone, through the
construction of storage reservoirs for water,
will make many millions of acres of fertile
lands available for settlement. Over $20,000,
000 from these sources have been already re
ceived to the credit of the reclamation fund.
Over 33,000.000 acres of public lands in four
teen States and Territories have been embraced
in the sixty-seven projects which have been de
vised and are under examination, and on eight
of these the work of actual construction has
begun. . ' - â¢
business has been Jeopardized, no fair and
honest enterprise, has been Injured; but it is
certain that wherever the constitutional, power
of the National Government reaches trusts are
being practically regulated and curbed within
lawful bounds as they never have before, and
the men of small capital are finding in the
efficiency and skill of the national department
of Justice a protection they never had before
against the crushing effect of unlawful com
binations. . - . .

UNLAWFUL COMBINATIONS.
After long conelderatlon Congress passed
three practical statutes: On the 11th of Febu
ary 19O.'5, an act to expedite hearings In oults
In enforcement of anti-trust act; on the 14th
of February, 1903, the act creating a new De
partment of Commerce and Labor with a.Bu
reau of Corporations, having authority to se
cure systematic Information regarding â¢ the
organization and operation of corporations en
gaged In Interstate commerce; and on -the 19th
of February. 1903, an 'act enlarging the powers
of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of
the courts, to deal with secret rebates In trans
portation charges, which are the ' chief means
by which the' trusts crush out their smaller
competitors.
The AttomeyrGeneral has gone on in the
same practical way, not to talk about the
trusts but to proceed against the trusts by law
for their' regulation. In- separate -suits four
teen of the great railroads of the. country have
been restrained by injunction from .giving ille
gal rebates to the favored shipper.,' who by
means- of them, were driving out the smaller
shippers and monopolizing the grain and meat
business of the country. The beef trust was
put under injunction. The officers of the-rail
roads engaged In. the cotton' carrying pool, af
fecting all thatgreal Industry of the South,
were Indicted and hsrve abandoned their com
biratlon. The Northern â¢ Securities Company,
which undertook by combining, ip one owner
ship the capital stocks of the Northern Pacific
and Great Northern - railroads to end traffic
competition In the Northwest, - has been I de
stroyed by a vigorous prosecution expedited
and brought to a speedy and .effective. conclu
sion in the. Supreme Court 'under.. the act of
February 11. 1903. The Attorney-General sayÂ»:
"Here, then, are four phases of the attack
on the combinations, in. restraint of trade and
commerce â the railroad : Injunction â¢ suits, the
cotton pool cases, the beef . trust cases and the
Northern Securities case. . The first relates to
the monopoly produced by secret and prefer
ential rates for railroad - transportation; the
second to railroad traffic pooling; the.third^to
a combination - of independent' corporations . to
fix and maintain extortionate prices for meats.
and .the fourth to a corporation organized to
merge into Itself the control of parallel and
competing lines of railroad and to eliminate
competition in their rates of transportations." '
"I believe that monopolies, unjust discrimi
nations, which" prevent or cripple competition,
fraudulent over-capitalization, and other 'evils
In trust organizations and practices which in
juriously affect interstate trade can be pre
vented under the power of the Congress to
'regulate commerce with foreign nations and
among the several States' through regulations
and requirements operating directly upon such
commerce, the Instrumentalities thereof, and
those engaged therein.*'
CREATES NEW DEPARTMENT.
'"We can do nothing of good In the way of
regulating and supervising these corporations
until we fix clearly In our minds that we are
iiot attacking the corporations, but endeavoring
to do away with any evil In them. We are not
hostile to them; we are merely determined that
they shall be so handled as to subserve th*
public good. We. draw the line against mis
conduct, not against wealth. â¢ â¢ â¢
"In curbing and regulating the combinations
of capital which are or may become Injurious
to the public we must be careful not to stop the
great enterprises which have legitimately re
duced the cost of production, not to abandon
the place which our country has won in the
leadership of the International Industrial world,
not to strike down wealth with the result of
closing factories and ' mines, of turning th?
wage-worker Idle in the streets and leaving
the farmer without a market for what he
grows. â¢ â¢ â¢
"A fundamental base of civilization I. the
inviolability of property; but this Is In no wise
inconsistent with tbe right of society to regu
late the exerctte of the artificial powers which
It confers upon the owners of property, under
the name of corporate franchises, in such a
way as to prevent the misuse of these pow
ers. â¢ â¢ â¢
At every election the regulation "of trusts had
been the football of campaign oratory and the
subject of many insincere declarations. â¢
Our Republican administration has taken up
the subject In a practical, sensible way as a
business rather than a political question, saying
what it really meant, and doing what lay at
Its hand to be done to accomplish effective
regulation. The principles upon which the
Government proceeded were stated by the
President in his message of December, 1902.
He .aid: - Â¦
this Blatter by legislation the laws passed for
that purpose thus far hare proved ineffective,
not because of any- lack of disposition 'or at
tempt to enforce them, but simply because the
laws themselves as Interpreted by the courts
<Jo not reach the difficulty. If the Insufficien
cies of existing laws can be remedied by further
legislation it should be done. The fact must be
recognized, however, that all Federal legislation
on this subject may fall short \ of It. purpose
because of inherent obstacles and also because
of the complex character of our governmental
system, which, while making Federal authority
supreme within its sphere, has carefully limited
that sphere by metes and bound, that cannot be
transgressed."
RETIRING HEAD OF NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN OF CONVENTION.
The last vestige of insurrection has been
swept away. With their work accomplished
over SS.000 American troops have been
brought back across thtÂ» Pacific. Civil govern
ment ' has been established throughout the
archipelago. Peace and order and Justice pre
vail. The. Philippine Commission, guided at
first by executive order and then by the wise
leglslationjof Congress^In the Philippine Gov
ernment act or July 1. 1902. has established
and conducted a government which has been a
credit to its country and a blessing to the
people of the islands. The body of laws
which they have enacted upon careful and in
telligent study of the needs of the country
challenges comparison with the statutes of any
country, j The personnel of civil government
has been brought together under an advanced
and comprehensive civil service law, which has
been rigidly enforced. A complete census has
been taken, designed to be there as It was In
Cuba tho basis for representative government:
and the people of the islands will soon proceed
under provisions already made by Congress to
the election of a representative assembly. In
which for the first time in their history they
may have a voice In the making of their own
laws. In the meantime the local and pro
vincial governments are in the hands of officers
elected by the Filipinos; and in the great cen
tral offices, in the commission, on the bench,
in the executive departments, the most distin
guished men of the Filipino race are taking
their part in the government of their people.
A free school uystem has been established and
hundreds of thousands of children are learn
ing lessons which will help fit them tor self
government. The seeds of religious strife ex-
Istins In the bitter controversy between the
people and the rellglotia orders have been de
prived of _ potency for harm by the purchase
of the 'friars', lands, and their practical with
drawal. By the act of Congress of March
2 1903 a gold standard has been established
to take the place of the fluctuating silver cur
rency. The unit of value is made exactly one
half I the Â¦ value i of the American gold dollar,
so. that American money is practically part of
their currency system. To enable the Philip
pine Government to issue this, new currency
$Â« 000,000 was borrowed by them In 1903 In
the city of. New York, and it was borrowed at
a net' interest charge of 1% per cent per an
num. The trade of the islands has Increased
notwithstanding. 'adverse conditions. During"
the last five years of peace under Spanish rule
the average total trade of the Islands was less
than $o6.000.000. During the fiscal year ending
June SO, 1903, the trade of the islands waa over
$66,000,000. - There is but one point of dla-
When the last national convention met the
Philippines also were under military rule. The
insurrectos from the mountains spread terror
among the peaceful people by midnight foray
and secret assassination. Aguinaldo bided his
time in a secret retreat. Over 70.000 American
soldiers . from more than 50O stations held a
still vigorous enemy in check. The Philip
pine Commission had not yet begun Its work.
NO MORE INSURRECTION.

of the Island having been Just transferred I.

REPUBLIC OF CUBA
The new Republic began its existence with
an administration of Cubans completely organ
ized in all its branches and trained to effective
service by American officers. The administra
tion of President Palma haÂ« been wise and effi
cient. Peace and order have prevailed. The
people of Cuba are prosperous and happy.
Her finances have been honestly administered,
and her credit is high. The naval stations have
been located and bounded at Guantanarao and
Bahla Honda, and are in the possession of our
navy. The >Platt amendment Is the sheet an
chor of Cuban Independence and of Cuban
credit. No such revolutions as have afflicted
Central and South America are possible there,
because it Is known to all men that an at
tempt to .overturn the foundations of that
Government will be confronted by the over-
Whelming power of the UnitÂ«-d States. The
treaty of reciprocity and the act of Congress of
December 6, 190:1, which confirmed it, com
pleted the expression of our policy toward Cuba;
which with a far view to the future alms to
bind to us by ties of benefit and protection, of
mutual Interest and genuine friendship, that
Island which guards the Caribbean and the
highway to the isthmus, and must always be
if hostile, an outpost of attack, and. If friend
ly, an outpost of defense for the United States.
Rich as we are. the American people have no
more valuable possession than the sentiment
expressed In the dispatch which I will now
read:
On the 20th of May. 1002, under a constitu
tion which embodied these stipulations, the
government and control of Cuba were sur
rendered to the President and Congress electea
by her people, a.nd the American army sailed
away.
protect the farmer's product and extend his
market. an<l to Improve the conditions of the
farmer's life; to advance the time when
America shall raise within her own limits
every product of the soil consumed by her
people, as she makes within her own limits
every necessary product of manufacture â these
have been cardinal objects of Republican ad
ministration; and we show a record of practi
cal things done toward the accomplishment of
these objects never before approached.
Four years ago we held the Island of Cuba
by military occupation. The opposition charged
and the people of Cuba believed that we did not
Intend to keep the pledge of April 20, 1898, that
when the pacification of Cuba was accom
plished we should leave the government and
control of the Island to Its people. The new
policy toward Cuba which should follow the
fulfillment of that pledge was unformed. Dur
ing the four years It has been worked out In
detail and has received effect. It was com
municated by executive order to the Military
Governor. It was embodied in the act of Con
gress known as the Platt amendment. It was
accepted by the Cuban Constitutional Conven
tion on the 12th of October, 1901. It secured to
Cuba her liberty and her Independence, but it
required her to maintain them. It forbade her
ever to use the freedom we had earned for her.
by so stoat a sacrifice of blood and treasure,
lo give the Island to any other power; It re
quired her to maintain a Government adequate
for the protection of life and property and
liberty, and should she fail, it gave us the right
to Intervene for the maintenance of Mich a
government. And It gave us the right to naval
stations upon her coast for the protection and
defense alike of Cuba and the United States.
TREATY WITH CHINA.
Under the ' Influence of this effective friend
ship a new. commercial, treaty with China,
proclaimed on the 8th of October last, has
enlarged our - opportunities for trade, opened
new ports to our commerce, and abolished in
ternal duties on goods in transit within the em
pire. There were indeed other nations which
agreed with this policy of American diplo
macy, but no other nation was free from sus
picion of selfish alms. None other had won
confidence in the sincerity of Its purpose, and
none other but America could render the serv
ice which we have rendered to humanity In
China during the pant four years. High evi
dence of that enviable position of our country
is furnished by the fact that when all Europe
was in apprehension leat the field of war be
tween Russia and Japan should ao spread as
to involve China's ruin and a universal con
flict. It was to the American Government that
the able and farslehted German Emperor ap
pealed to take the lead again In bringing
about an agreement 'for the limitation of the
field of action, and the preservation of tho
administrative entity of China outside of Man
churia; and that was accomplished.
Upon our own continent a dispute with Can
ada over the boundary of Alaska had been
growing more acute for thirty years. A multi
tude of m'ners swift to defend their own
rights py force were locating mining claims
under the laws of both countries In the dis
puted territory- At any moment a fatal affray
between - Canadian and American miners waa
liable to begin a conflict in which all British
Columbia would be arrayed on one side and
all our Northwest upon the other. Agreement
was Impossible. But the Alaskan boundary
treaty of January 24. 1903. provided a tribunal
for the decision of the controversy; and upon
legal proofs and reasoned argument an appeal
has boen had from prejudice and passion to
Judicial judgment: and under the lead of a
great Chief Justice of England, who held the
sacred obllzations of his Judicial office above
all other considerations, the dispute has been
settled forever and substantially In accordance
with the American contention.
In 1900 the first administration of McKlnJs/
The express adherence of the powers of
Europe to this declaration was secured. The
open recognition of the rule of right conduct
imposed Its limitations upon the conduct of the
powers In tho Orient. It wu made the test
of defensible action. Carefully guarded by the
wise statesman who had secured its accept
ance. It brought a \ moral force of recognized
value to protect peaceful and helpless China
from dismemberment and spoliation, and to
preserve the open door In the Orient for the
commerce of the world. .
"To seek a solution which may bring about
permanent safety and peace to China, preserve
China's territorial and administrative entity,
protect all rights guaranteed to friendly pow
ers by treaty and international law, and safe
guard for the world the principle of equal
and impartial trade with all parts of th*
Chinese empire."
IN JUSTICE AND HONOR.
The action of the United States at every
step has been in accordance with the law of
nations, consistent with the principles of jus
tice and honor. In discharge of the trust to
build the canal we long since assumed, by de
nying the right of every other power to build
It, dictated by a high and unselfish purpose,
for the common benefit of all mankind. That
action was wise, considerate, prompt, vigor
ous and effective: and now the greatest of
constructive nations stands ready and compe
tent to begin and to accomplish the great en
terprise which shall realize the dreams of past
ages, bind together our Atlantic and Pacific
coasts, and open a new highway for that
commerce of the Orient whose course has con
trolled the rise and fall of civilizations. Suc
cess in that enterprise greatly concerns the
credit and honor of the American people, and
it is for them to say whether the building of
the canal shall be In charge of the men who
made its building possible, or of the weak
lings whose incredulous objections would have
postponed it for another generation.
i Throughout the world the diplomacy of tbe
present administration has made for peace and
Justice among nations. Clear- sighted to per
ceive and prompt \ to maintain American inter
ests. It has been sagacious and simple and di
rect in its methods, and considerate of the
rights and of the feelings of others.
Within the month after the last , national

Mohammedan Moros. where there Is an occa

FREE AND PEACEFUL PEOPLE.
When Governor Taft sailed from Manila In
December last to fill the higher office where
he will still guard the destinies of the people
for whom he has done &uch great and noble
service, he was followed to tSe shore by a
mighty throng, not of repressed and sullen
subjects, but of free and peaceful people,
whose tears and prayers of affectionate fare
well showed that they had already begun to
learn that "our flag has not lost Its gift of
benediction m its world-wide journey to their
shores."
None can foretell the future: but there
aeems no reasonable cause to doubt, that under
the policy already effectively Inaugurated, the
Institutions already Implanted, and the pro
cesses already begun, in the Philippine Isl
ands. If these be not repressed and Interrupted,
the Philippine people will follow In the foot
steps of the people of Cuba; that more slowly
Indeed, because they are not as advanced,
yet as surely, they will grow In capacity for
eelf-government. and receiving power aa they
grow in capacity, will come to bear substan
tially such relations to the people of the
United States as do now the people of Cuba,
differing- in details aa conditions and needs dif
fer, but the same In principle and the same
in beneficent results.
In 10CO the project of an Isthmian canal
stood where it was left by the Clayton- Bulwer
treaty of 1850. For half a century It had
halted, with Great Britain resting upon a joint
right of control, and the great undertaking of
De Lessens struggling against the doom of
failure imposed by extravagance and corrup
tion. On the ISth of November, 1901, the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty with Great Britain re
lieved the enterprise of the right of British
control and left that right exclusively In the
United States. Then followed swiftly the ne
gotiations and protocols with Nicaragua; the
isthmian canal act of June 23. 11*02; the Just
agreement with the French Canal Company
to pay them the value of the work they had
done: the negotiation and ratification of the
treaty with Colombia; the rejection of that
treaty by Colombia in violation of our rights
and the world's right to the passage of the
Isthmus; the seizure by Panama of the op
portunity, to renew her oft-repeated effort to
throw off the hateful and oppressive yoke of
Colombia and re.-ume the independence which
once had been hers, and of which she had
been deprived by fraud and force; the success
of the revolution; our recognition of the new
republic followed by recognition from substan
tially all the civilized powers of the world;
the treaty with Panama recognizing and con
firming our right to construct the canal; the
ratification of the treaty by the Senate; con
firmatory legislation by Congress; the payment
of the $3O,00O.0CO to the French company and
to Panama; the appointment of the Canal Com
mission In accordance with law; and its or
ganization to begin the work.

We shall ask the continued confidence of the
people Â»<ecause the candidates whom we present
are cf proved competency and patriotism, fitted
to fill the offices for which they are nominated,
to tbe credit and honor of our country.
We shall a*k it because the present policies
of our Government are beneficial and ought no*
to be net urMc; and the people's bu.lnesa Is
f ":r-c well done, and ought not to be inter
fered with.
We shall a.k It because the character of th.
party gives assurance of good government. A
great political organization, competent to rov
ern. Is rot a chance collection of Individuals
brought together for tbe moment aa the shift
ing sands are piled up by wind and sea, to be
ewept away, to be formed and re-formed again.
It is a growth. Traditions and sentiments reach
ing down through struggles of years gone, and
the stress and heat of eld conflicts, and the ln-
Tuence of leaders passed away, and the ln
rralned habit cf applying fixed rules of Inter
pretation axd of thought, all give to a politi
cal party known and inalienable qualities from
which must follow, in its deliberate judgment
and ultimate action, like results for good or
bad government. We do not deny that other
parties have In their membership men of mo
rality and patriotism: but we assert with con
fidence that above all others, by the Influences
Â»hich gave It birth and have maintained Its
life, by the cause, for which It has striven, the
Ideal, which It ha. f ollowcd. the Republican
party as a party ha. acquired a character
which makes Its ascendancy the best guarantee
of a government loyal to principle and effective
in execution. Through It more than any other
political organization the moral sentiment of
America finds expression. It cannot depart
frcm the direction of its tendency. From what
it has been may be known certainly what It
must be. Not all of us rife to its standard;
not all of us are worthy of Its glorious history;
but as a whole this great political organiza
tion â the party of Lincoln and McKinley can
not fail to work In the spirit of Its past and
in loyalty to great Ideals.
ASK CONTINUED CONFIDENCE.
WÂ« shall aolc it because the unbroken record
of the Republican party in the past Is an as
eurance cf the sincerity of our declarations and
the fidelity with which we shall give them
effect. Because we have been constant In princi
ple, loyal to our beliefs and faithful to our
promises, we are entitled to be believed and
trusted now.
We ehall ask It because the principles to
which we declare our adherence are right, and
the best interests of our country require that
Ibey ehould be followed in Its government.
With the platform and the candidates cf this
convention we are about to aÂ»k a renewed ex
pression of popular confidence In the Republi
can party.

FIRST HALF CENTURY.
Â¦When the course of the next administration Is
tut half done the Republican party will have
completed the first half century of its national
life. Of the eleven administrations since the
first election of Abraham Lincoln, nine â cover-
Ing a peric>d of thirty-six years â have been un
der Republican Presidents. For the greater
part of that time the majority in each House
of Congress ha. been Republican. History af
fords no parallel in any age or country for the

life, the uplifting of the great mass of the
people above the bard conditions of poverty, the
common opportunity for education and Indi

civil and religious liberty, the protection of
property and security for the rewards of In
dustry and enterprise, the cultivation of na
tional morality, respect for religion, sympathy
with humanity and love of liberty and Justice,
* hich have marked the life of the American
people during this long period of Republican
control.
Four years ago we were living under aa
obsolete militia law more than & century old.
which Washington and Jefferson and Madison
and almost every President since their tlmÂ»
had declared to be worthless. We presented
the curious spectacle of a people depending
upon a citizen soldiery for protection against
aggression, and making" practically no provision
whatever for training- Us citizens In the us* of
warlike weapons Â»r In the elementary dutlen
of the soldier. The mandate of tho constitution
which required Congress to provide for organ
izing, arming and disciplining the militia had
been left unexecuted. In default of national
provisions bodies of State troops, created for
local purposes and supported at local expense,
had grown up throughout the Union. Their
feelings toward the- regular army were rather
of distrust and dislike than of comradeship.
Their arms, equipment, discipline, organization
and methods of obtaining and accounting for
supplies were varied and Inconsistent. They
were unsulted to become a part of any homo
genuous force, and their relations to the army
of the United States were undefined and con
jectural. By the militia act of January Â»V
1903. Congress performed Its duty tindery thÂ»
constitution. leaving these bodies still to
perform their duties to the States it mad*
them the organized militia of the Unltett
States It provided for their conformity in
armament. e-Vganlzatlon and discipline to the
army of the United States: It provided thÂ»
ways In which, either strictly as militia or as
volSnteerT they should become an active part
of the army when called upon; It provided
for their training Instruction and exercise con
jointly with the regular army: it Imposed upon
the regular Â«nny the duty of promoting their
efficiency In many ways. In recognition of th*j
service to the nation which these cttlien sol
diers would be competent to render thÂ» nation
THE MILITIA LAW
In the meantime, mindful that moral power*
unsupported by physical strength do not al
ways avail against selfishness and aggression
we have been augmenting the forces which
command resDect.
We have brought our navy to a high state
of efficiency and have exercised both army and
navy in the methods of seacoast defense. The
Joint Army and Navy Board has been bringing
the two services together In good understanding
and the common study of the strategy, the
preparation and the co-operation which will
make them effective in time of need. Our
ships have been exercised in fleet and squad
ron movements, have been improved in marks
man.-hip and mobility, and have been con
stantly tested by use. Since the last national
convention met we have completed and added
to our navy 5 battleships. 4 cruisers. 4, moni
tors, 34 torpedo destroyers and torpedo boats;
while we have put under construction l.Â» bat
tleships and 13 cruisers.
Four years ago our army numbered ovar
100. 00O menâ regulars and volunteers. 73 per
cent of them in the Philippines and China.
Under the operation of statutes limiting th*
period of service, it was about to lapse back
Into its old and insufficient number of 2..0OO.
and Its old and insufficient organization linger
the practical control of permanent staff de
partments at Washington, with the same divi
sions of counsel and lack, of co-ordinating and
directing power at the head that led to con
fusion and scandal in the war with Spain.
During the past four years the lessons taught
by that war have received practical effect.
The teachings of Sherman and of Upton have
been recalled and respected. Congress has
fixed a maximum of the army at luO.OOO.
and a minimum at 60,000. so that maintaining
only the minimum In peace, as we now do.
when war threatens the President may begin
preparation by filling the ranks to the maxi
mum without waiting until after war has
begun, as he had to wait in 1S0S. Perma
nent staff appointments have been changed tr>
details from the line, with compulsory returns
at fixed Intervals to service with troops, wo
that the requirements of the field and the
camp rather than the requirements of the office
desk shall control the departments of adminis
tration and supply. A corps organization has
been provided for our artillery, with a chief
of artillery at the head, so that there may
be intelligent use of our costly seacoast de
fenses Under the act of February 14. 1003.
a general staff has been established, organized
to suit American conditions and requirements
and adequate for the performance of the long
neglected but all-Important duties of directing
military education and training, and applying
the most advanced principles of military srteno
to that necessary preparation for war which is
the surest safeguard of peace. The command
of the army now rests where It Is placed by
the constitution â In the President. His power
is exercised through a military chief of staff
pledged by tie conditions and tenure of his
office to. confidence and loyalty to IMS cÂ«wÂ»
mander. Thus civilian control of the military
army upon wltCh we must always Insist, la
reconciled with that military efficiency which
can be obtained only under the direction of
the trained military expert.
THE ARMY AND NAVY.
VENEZUELA INCIDENT.
When In 1903 the failure of Venesuel* to
pay her Just debts led England Germany and
Italy to warlike measures for the collection of
their claims, an appeal by Venezuela to our
Government resulted in agreements upon arbi
tration in place of the war, and In a request
that our President should act as arbitrator.
Again he promoted the authority and prestige
of The Hague tribunal, and was able to lead
all the powers to submit the crucial questions
in controversy to the determination of that
ceurt. It is due greatly to support by the
American Government that this agency lor
peace has disappointed the expectations of its
detractors and by demonstrations of practical
usefulness has begun a career fraught wtth
possibilities of Incalculable benefit to mankind.
On the 11th of April. 1003. waa proclaimed
another convention between all the great pow
ers agreeing upon more humane rules for the
conduct of war; and these in substance Incor
porated and gave the sanction of the civilized
world to the rules drarted by Francis Lieber
and approved by Abraham Lincoln for the con
duct of the armies of the United States in thÂ»
field.
All Americans who desire safÂ«Â» and conser
vative administration which shall avoid caiute
of quarrel all who abhor war. all who long
for the perfect sway of the principles oÂ« that
religion which we all profess, should rejoice
that under thl3 Republican administration their
country has attained a potent leadership among
the nations in the cause of peace and Interna
tional Justice. ,
The respect and moral power thus gained
has been exercised in the Interests of human
ity, where the rules of diplomatic intercourse
have made formal Intervention impossible.
When the Roumanian outrages and when tha
appalling massacre at Klshlneff shocked civ
ilization and filled thousands of our own peo
ple with mourning, the protest of America was
heard through the voice of its Government,
with full observance of diplomatic rules, but
with moral power and effect.
We have advanced the authority of the
Monroe doctrine. Our adherence to the con
vention which established The Hague tribunal
was accepted by the other powers, with a
formal declaration that nothing Â» he Â« la co Â»
tained ehould be construed to imply the relin
qulshment by the United States of Its tradi
tional attitude toward purely American ques
tions Th. armed demonstration by the Eu
ropean powers against Venezuela was made
the occasion for disclaimers to the Lnite*i
States of any Intention to seize the territory
of Venezuela, recognizing In the most unmis
takable way the rights of the United States
expressed in the declaration of that traditional
policy.
had played a great part In establishing Th*
Hague Tribunal for International Arbitration.
The prevailing- opinion of Europe was Incred
ulous as to the practical utility of the pro
vision, and anticipated a paper tribunal un
sought by litigants. It was the example of
the United States which sot at naught this
opinion. The first International case taken to
The Hague tribunal was under our protocol
with Mexico of May 22. 1902. submitting our
contention for the rights of the Roman Cath
olic church in California to a share of the
church moneys held by the Mexican Govern
ment before the cession, and known as the
Pious fund; and the tirat decision of the
tribunal was an award In our favor upon that
question.

If the agreement of April 23 Is modified or
amended to conform with the . above regula
tions of the board the petitions for permits
will bo granted. Otherwise the board will h'.ld
that said agreement Is opposed In letter and
spirit to the Woodward act and the p*ltlons
of Wolf &Â»Sons,' the American Produce Com
pany and L. Scatena ie Co. for permits will
be denied. 'â¢ '
Cach permit holder has agreed with this
board in wrltlnu that he will not, during the
life of guch permltr be a party to any con
spiracy, agreement or understanding whereby
he shall refuse to sell to any solvent purchaser
or buy from any person whatever.
In clause 6 of the agreement of April 23
there is unquestionably an agreement among
the signers thereof that they will not sell to
or buy from each other potatoes and onions
in quantities lers than fifty and twenty-five
boxes respectively.
This is admittedly done for the purpose of
fixing a wholesale price on such product. . In
other words, there Is a combination among
the signers of this agreement whereby they
say what shall be considered wholesale quanti
ties. Rule 44IJ prescribes that dealers In such
products shall sell theri In lots as small aa
ten boxes of potatoes anil five boxes of onions.
This Is a rule or regulation fixed in pursuance
of the power given the board by the Woodward
act. . . . Â¦ . â¢ .Â¦
In the judgment of the board, acting upon
the opinion of Its counsel, the Woodward law
contemplates that all persons holding permits
to sell perishable products on the wharves
must 8#U such products impartially. In such
quantities as the purchasers may desire at
the same prices, but for the purpose of trade
the unit upon which to base a wholesale price
has b^en fixed at ten boxes or sacks of po
tatoes and five sacks of onions, and that In
so far as the agreement of April 23. 190*.
between the wholesalers attempts to fix fifty
boxes ot. potatoes and twenty-five boxes of
onions as the unit or basis upon which to
fix the wholesale price of potatoes and onions,
with a sliding Increase In price for smaller
quantities of such product, it violates the
terms of said iaw and the regulation of this
board. . . '
JUDGMENT OF BOARD,
The board has prescribed the ten and five
rule for potatoes and onions respectively and
deems it a reasonable one and will enforce it.
The inconvenience which may be felt by the
jobber will possibly be a benefit to the con
sumer of such produce.
In plain language the Woodward law seems
to have been enacted for the protection of both
tbe grower or producer and the consumer, and
to be intended to prevent a condition under
which the grower might receive a very small
compensation for his produce while the con
sumer could only obtain it at a very high
or perhaps a prohibitive price.
This would seem to be best obtained, by an
arrangement that would allow the small re
taller to buy from the wholesaler on the
wharves, thus bringing the agent of the
grower (the wholesale dealer) and the agent
of the consumer (the small retailer) Into di
rect communication, and for the better ac
complishment of this purpose the holder of
a permit to sell perishable products on the
wharves Is given a free license or right to
use State property for his personal business
and Profit. In return for this license or right
the State demands some return or considera
tion, and that Is that the permit holder shall
sell importially to all for cash and shall enter
Into no agreement not to sell or buy from any
person whateverâ all under such general regu
lations as this board may prescribe.
This board has among its rules one, to
wlt. No. 44%, which says that a price must
be established on potatoes in lots as small
as ten boxes or sacks and on onions on Iota
as small as five sacks, thereby meetlns the
requirements of the small retailer and also
complying more nearly with the custom of the
markets of the world, where the unit of meas
urement upon which prices are based Is usually
a small one. - such as bushels, pounds, yards,
etc, with, as a matter of negotiation, a de
crease in price for a large lot and not, as In
this case, a Urge unit, fifty and twenty-five
sacks, with an increase in price for a smaller
lot. I
The Harbor Commissioners an
nounced yesterday that unless the
wholesale produce dealers in this city
modify their agreement regarding the
minimum lots of potatoes and onions
to be sold by them on the State's prop
erty in this city wharf permits' will
be -withheld. If, however, " it* shall be
shown to the Commissioners -at their
regular meeting to be held one week
from to-day that the objectionable part
in their agreement fixing a high mini
mum has been abandoned, the new per
mits to L. Scatena & Co., the American
Produce Company and Wolf & Son will
be issued. The arguments having been
made at a previous meeting of the
Commissioners, the proceedings of yes
terday were brief. Commissioner Kirk

It was agreed that a committee
from the dairymen meet with the
Board of Health \o-morrow night at
8:30 to arrive at some understanding,
a report of the conclusions to be filed
with the Hospital Committee on Fri
day morning.
A number of dairy owners and milk
dealers appeared yesterday before the
Hospital and Health Committee of the
Board of Supervisors to protest
against the incorporation in a pro
posed ordinance of the rules and reg
ulations adopted by the Health Board
for the sanitary conduct of dairies.
The dairymen were represented by
George H. Pippy, who argued that the
regulations were too drastic and if
made mandatory would cause great
hardship to the milk industry.
Pippy said the dairymen were will
ing to meet with the Board of Health
to agree on sanitary requirements, but
were not willing to go to any elaborate
expense.
Dr. Ward, president of the Board of
Health, said it was not intended to
work a hardship on the dairymen, but
the board would insist on having pure
milk supplied to consumers, as bad
milk worked a hardship on the pub
lic. Messrs. Daly, Brewer, Pohlman
and Stone were heard and they pro
tested against certain specific rules.
Pohlman said that most dairymen
rented their premises and- that the
conditions are too onerous and prac
tically ' impossible of compliance.
Stone said that trouble would result
with union milkers if the rules were
enforced.

OAKLAND. June 21. â At the marriage of
Miss Edith Larkey and Arnold Needham this
evening the nuptial blessing wu pronounced
by the groom's father. Rev. A. T. Needham.
Although relatives and a few dear friends only
were present at the eimpre little ceremony,
and no elaborate preparations had been made,
it was one of the prettiest of the many June
weddings.
The bride and all of her attendants were In
white, the needed touch of color showing In
the decorations which had been arranged with
exquisite taste under the direction of Miss Ida,
Larkey. /Palms overarched the hall and stair
way and the dining-room was a delightful
study in red and green. The tiny drawing
room, however, where the ceremony took place
was of course the center of attraction. Across
the round, shallow window a coarse white net.
Interwoven with pink blossoms, was draped
and overhead a canopy of white tulle and as
paragus fern supported a bell of white sweet
peas. Elsewhere in the room sprays of feath
ery wild parsley were gracefully disposed,
while lilies and pink carnations shed their
fragrance over an unusually pretty scene.

thing will be done in regard to the
ordinance regulating the fees charged
by the City Engineer. Either the
rates will be reduced or arrangements
made to divert some portion of them
to the city.
"In many cases the charges are too
high," said President Rickard to-day.
"They ought to be equalized, and I
think part of the income should go to
increase the salaries of some of our
underpaid officials."
"My gross Income last year was
$10,000," said Mr. Huggins, when in
formed of this impending change.
"Out of that amount I had to pay for
assistance that cost $4000, so it is not
all profit. This year it may amount
to something more. The office has not
always paid like that, however, and
only these last two or three years have
been so profitable to me."

SERIOUS ACCIDENTS
BEFALL OAKLAXDERS
Drs. John Fearn and .7. M. Shan
non Arc Run Into and Sus
tain Injuries.
OAKLAND, June 21. â Three reports
of serious accidents were received at
police headquarters this morning. Dr.
John Fearn, one of Oakland's well
known physicians, was run down by a
car at Eighth and West streets while
riding his bicycle. Two of his ribs
were broken and he sustained several
severe lacerations.
At almost the same time this acci
dent happened in one part of the city,
Dr. J. M. Shannon was thrown from
his buggy in another. He was driving
down Telegraph avenue when his
buggy was overtaken by a runaway
horse drawing a butcher's cart. The
animal had become frightened at a
Fourth of July pistol. The wheels of
the cart crashed into the doctor's
buggy and upset it. Dr. Shannon was
thrown out. His nose was broken and
his knees were badly cut.
While returning home from a bar
becue at Lake Chabot last night Carl
Steffen, a butcher, fell from the rear
end of a buggy in which he was rid
ing and his spine was seriously in
jured. He was removed to the County
Infirmary this morning. It is believed
that he will have to be operated on.
While Beach Soule and a friend
were driving Out Broadway this morn
ing their spirited horse ran away with
them. Out on Telegraph avenue the
animal ran between two piles of
bitumen, where he became wedged,
and was caught. The men were badly
shaken up but otherwise unharmed.
Supervisors' Committee Invites New
Proposals, Owine to Wide Differ
ence In Prices.
The Joint committee on Hospitals,
Police and Public Buildings -yesterday
decided to reject all bids filed for hay
and grain for various city institutions
and to invite new bids. Action was
taken because of the varied prices
submitted. They ranged from $13 to
$16 per ton. The bids are to cover
the supply for all institutions instead
of being segregated as heretofore. The
bids for coal were also rejected be
cause of the great difference in the
prices. New bids were ordered to be
invited under general specifications.
Cannot Collect His Bill.
C. S. Brown swore to a complaint
yesterday charging C. W. Keys with
violating a recent ordinance making
It a misdemeanor to evade payment of
a bill for an automobile ride. Brown
alleges that on the night of June 17
Keys, who said he was connected with
the British Consulate, hired an auto
mobile to take some frineds for a ride.
Several hours were occupied in the
pleasures of the ride and when Brown,
who was the chauffeur, asked Keys
for payment of 540 he was blandly
told to send the account to the office
of the British Consul for collection.
Brown did so, but although he has
haunted the Consulate office he has
been unable to find Keys or get any
satisfaction.
The Crandall-Silva wing of the Un
ion Labor County Central Committee
received recognition from the Board of
Supervisors to-day in preference to the
Hyde-Atherton faction, which claims to
be the real committee. The question
of -which Fide had the better title to be
considered the real head of the Union
Labor party In Alameda County was
argued by Attorneys Hugh Aldrlch and
W. S. O'Brien before the board this
morning. On motion cf Supervisor H.
D. Rowe the petition of Crandall and
hi* followers to have the party name
go upon the ballots at the coming pri
mary election was then accepted as
coming from the legally constituted
head of the party.
The decision is deemwl of some im
portance, as it is claimed that it gives
the side recognized the power to ap
pomt all outside delegates. Within the
corporate limits of Alameda, Berkeley
and Oakland elections for delegates
must be held, but in the outlying dis
tricts these are appointed. It is claimed
that Crandall's Bide can go into the
convention with fifty-one appointed
delegates out of a total of 260. The only
county officers to be elected this fall in
whom the party Is interested are tbe
Supervisors. The reorganization of the
County Central Committee also takes
place, "however, and there is possibility
of a change in the entire machinery
of the party.

The leng lost man expressed joy at
hearing from his relatives, whom he
had thought dead, too. It seems that
after the war he wandered about the
country for a long time before settling
down to regular habits again, and thus
failed to hear of his family. Then he
went to Taltal, Chile, and became in
terested in mines, which have made him
a rich man. He married and now has
a family of his own.
"It Is just like having somebody risen
from the dead," said Mrs. Boettiger to
day. "It is a stranger story than I
ever read. We are all thankful to have
him restored to us, and may have a
family reunion some day."

Like a voice from the dead that of
Frank Thamm has come back to his
mother and his sister, who, for twenty
five years, believed he was dead. He
has not actually reappeared before
them in the flesh, but they know he
is still living, for a letter haa come
from him in far-off Chile. It has been
reserved for Mrs. William Thamm, the
mother of .this modern Lazarus, and
Mrs. Herman C. Boettiger, his sister, of
1701 Walnut street, to know this experi
ence of having kin restored to them
after such a lapse of years.
Altogether it is a strange story.
Frank Thamm was an adventurous
spirit and young twenty-five years ago
when ha lived with his family in Chile.
His love of adventure attracted him
to the army when the war between
Chile and Peru broke out, and he
foueht all through it.
But the soldier did not come back
after the war v and a year or two after
ward, his family having heard that he
had fallen in battle, came to California.
It occurred to the mother and sister
often that he might not be dead, but
they did not make any positive at
tempt to find him.
About six months ago, however, Mrs.
Boettiger's husband wrote to Chile In
the hope of settling all doubt about
Thamm's fate. A letter came in reply
to this communication yesteraay and
the family fully expected that it would
tell a tale of death. But great was
their surprise when they opened it
and found that Thamm himself had
written it.
Timothy'O'Leary, father of the youth,
attempted to quiet him, and a fierce
struggle ensued, that only ended when
neighbors came to the assistance of the
elder man and aided him in binding hl3
son hand and foot with a clothes line.
Young O'Leary was then conveyed to
the Receiving Hospital and placed un
der the influence of opiates. It is
thought by the physicians who exam
ined him that the youth's mind Is but
temporarily deranged.
Grief over the death of his mother.
Mrs. Mary O'Leary. which occurred
this morning, caused 19-year-old Paul
O'Leary to â¢ become mentally unbal
anced, so that his removal to the de
tention ward in the Receiving Hospital
became necessary. Shortly after Mrs.
O'Leary breathed her last the eon be
gan to act in & frenzied manner and
wreck the Interior of his home at 659
Albion street.

The county authorities have taken
action toward finding out who is the
real owner of a bill for $344 claimed by
both the Enquirer Publishing Com.
pany and Mrs. Kate T. Putnam. An
action was begun to-day by the District
Attorney against both parties, asking
for an Injunction restraining them from
bringing actions against the county for
the payment of the claim until it had
been decided which of tfiem is entitled
to the money.
The claim is of long standing and has
been the cause of much trouble. The
publishing company â¢ did printing for
Assessor Henry P. Dalton to the
amount named, and Its representative
assigned the account of Mrs. Putnam
in order to get the money without de
lay. The cash was passed through sev
eral hands and was stolen. Just who
got it has never been determined, but
both the Enquirer andfMrs. Putnam
are still claimants before the Board of
Supervisors for the money. When the
publishing company failed to get the
cash advanced by Mrs. Putnam it put
in a bill for the work, notwithstanding
that its claim had been assigned. The
company and Mrs. Putnam have kept
up a fight before the Supervisors until
finally the District Attorney was in
structed to bring the present action.

When arrested Sternheim was well
dressed. He has not the appearance of
a criminal. When searched at the Liv
ermore Jail several pawn tickets for
jewelry were found in his possession,
but he says these are for articles of his
own that he has been forced to pledge.
Sternheim was brought to the County
Jail in Oakland this evening.
He says he has apartments at 105 El
lis street, San Francisco, where he has
resided for some time and "where he has
a rare collection of Indian curios be
queathed to him by his father.
Julius Sternheim saya he is a son of
one of the Rajahs of India, but he was
arrested af Llvermore for burglary
committed at Ravenswood ranch, Chris
Buckley's summer home, and was held
to answer before the Superior Court to
day by Judge Taylor of Livermore.
It is alleged that Sternheim was seen
in the act of robbing the ranch, but
the defendant denies this and pleads
mistaken identity.
The suspect told a strange story on
the witness stand to-day. He says he
is not a negro, but an East Indian from
one of the interior provinces, of which
he declares his father was Rajah. He
says his father was banished from his
native land for inciting mutiny against
the British Government, and after.wan
dering about the world located in the
United States. Sternheim says this hap
pened when he was a small boy, and he
says he has lived in America ever since
that time.

not the butt of the youth of Mexico,
rather for the old people are reserved

No dividing line can bÂ« drawn athwart the
course of this successful administration. The
fatal 14th of September, 1901, marked no
change of policy, no lower level of achievement.
The bullet of the assassin robbed us of the
friend we loved; It took away from the people
the President of their choice; It deprived civi
lization of a potent force making always for
righteousness and for humanity. But tho fabric
of free institutions .remained unshaken. The
government of the people, went on. The great
party that William McKinley led wrought
still in the spirit of his example. - His true
and loyal Â» successor has been equal to the
burden cast upon him. Widely different in
temperament and methods, he has approved
himself of , the tame elemental virtuesâ the
same fundamental beliefs. With faithful and
revering memory, he has executed the Â¦ pur
poses and continued unbroken . the policy ot
President McKinley for the peace, prosperity
and honor of our beloved country. And he
has met all new occanlons with strength and

goes through many a year of leadership and

NO CHANGE OF POLICY.
McIUNXEY'S ADMINISTRATION.
The^nrst administration of McKinley fought
and won the war with Spain, put down the
insurrection in the Philippines, annexed Hawaii,
rescued the legations in Peking, brought Porto
Rico Into our commercial system, enacted a
protective tariff and established our national
currency on the firm foundations of the gold
standard by the financial legislation of the
Fifty-sixth Congress.
The present administration has reduced taxa
tion, reduced the public debt, reduced the
annual interest charge, made effective progress
In the regulation of trusts, fostered business,
promoted agriculture, built up the navy, re
organized the army, resurrected the militia
system, inaugurated a new policy for the
preservation and reclamation of public lands,
given cIvM government to the Philippines,
established, the republic of Cuba, bound it to
us by ties of gratitude, of commercial interest
and of common defense, swung open the closed
gateway of the isthmus, strengthened the
Monroe doctrine, ended the Alaskan boundary
dispute, protected the integrity of China,
opened wider its doors of trade, advanced the
principle of â arbitration and promoted peacs
among the nations.
We challenge Judgment upon this record of
effective performance In legislation, in exe
cution and In administration.
The work is not fully done; policies are non
completely wrought out; domestic questions
still press continually for solution; other trusts
must be regulated; the tariff may presently
receive revision, and If so, should receive It
at the hands of the friends and not the
enemies of the- protective system : the new
Philippine Government has only begun to de
velop Its plans for the benefit of that long
neglected country; our flag floats on the
isthmus, but the canal is yet to bÂ« bnllt;
peace does not yet reign on earth, and con
siderate firmness backed by strength are etlll
needful in diplomacy.
The American people have now to say
whether policies shall be reversed or committed
to unfriendly guardians; whether performance,
which now proves Itself for the benefit and
honor of our country, shall be transferred to
unknown and perchance to feeble hands.
assumed its share of the burden of their arma
ment, their supply and their training. The
workings of this system have already demon
strated, not only that we can have citizens
outside of the regular army trained for duty
la,, war, but that we can have a body of
volunteer officers ready for service, between
whom and the officers of the regular army
have been created by intimate association and
mutual helpfulness those relations of con
fidence and esteem without which no army can
be effective.
and specious pretenses, for our President haa
told the people with frankness what he believed
and what he intended. He has meant every
word he oaid, and the people have believed
every word he said, and with him this con
vention agTees because every word has been
sound Republican doctrine. No people can
maintain free government who do not in their
hearts value the qualities which have mala
the present President of the United States con-*
spicuoua among the men of his time as a type
of noble manhood. Come what may here â
come what may in November â God grant that
those qualities of brave true manhood shall
have honor throughout America, shall be held
for an example in every borne, and that the
youth of generations to come may grow up
to feel that it is better than wealth, or office,
or power, to have the honesty the purity an4
the courage of Theodore Roosevelt.
But we turn as they would have us turn,
to the duties of the hour, the hopes of the
future: we turn as they would have us turn,
to prepare ourselves for struggle under the
same standard borne in other hands by right
of true Inheritance. Honor, truth, courage,
purity of life, domestic virtue, love of country,
loyalty to high Ideals â all these combined with
active intelligence, with learning, with experi
ence in affairs, with the conclusive proof of
competency afforded by wise and conservative
administration, by great things already done
and great results already achieved â all these
we bring to the people with another candidate.
Shall not these have honor In our land?
Truth, sincerity, courage! These underlie the
fabric of our institutions. Upon hypocrisy and
sham, upon cunning and false pretense, upon
weakness and cowardice, upon the arts of the
demagogue and the devices of the mere politi
cian, no government can stand. No svstern of
popular government can endure in which the
people do not believe and trust. Our Presi
dent has taken the whole people into his con
fidence. Incapable of deception, he has put
aside concealment. Frankly and Without re
serve, hs has told them what their government
was doing and the reasons. It Is no campaign
of appearances upon which we enter, for the
people know the good and the bad. the success
and failure, to be credited and charged to our
account. It Is no campaign of sounding words

CHICAGO. June 21.â There was quite
a flutter in the commitj/te on rules and
order ot business, which met after the
convention adjourned, when objection
was made by some of the Middle West
and l'astern States to the proposed in
cre?.te of representation of Alaska in
the next national convention.
The committee selected Henry H.
BinÂ£ham of Pennsylvania for chair-
Man. J. F. Manning of Vermont secre
tary and Reno S. Harp of Maryland
and J. M. Stevens of Idaho assistant
secretaries. The rules of the last con
vention, as amended bv the national
committee, had been read, when C.
Fred Nixon of New York objected to
the amendment of the first rule, which
gives as future representation for
Alaska six votÂ«^ Instead of four, as at
present. He was supported in his ob
jection by the delegates from Dela
ware, Connecticut. Pennsylvania and
Tlhode Island. Nixon urged that the
continued increase in votes given to
Territories was simply throwing into
their hands the control of the conven
tion in the event of a close contest.
The Alaska member of the commit
tee, W. D. Grant, speaking for the
mnendment. said that his Territory,
with Its great growth and shorn of
much honor, asked for extra represen
tation to be on a footing of equality
with the other Territories.
Nixon protested that his objections
were not raided particularly against
Alaska, but to the whole system, which,
if adopted, would erive about forty-two
votes in the convention to the Terri
tories â enough to control on any close
proposition.
The vote an the motion to allow
Alaska increased representation was 21
nyes to It noes, the Southern and West
ern States voting solidly for It.
The committee then adopted the rules
of the last convention and the fifty
fourth Congress as the rules of the con
vention, with these amendments:
Rule 1 to read: The convention shall consist
of a number ot delegates from each State
â¢ qual to double the number ot Senators and

the ingenuous editor of the Liberty

anything but pawpaw bark and cis

What Causes Fires.
The annual losses by Ore in the
United States, which have averaged as
high as $100,000,000 a year at certain
periods, were attributed during a single

CONVENTION FAVORS INCREASED
REPRESENTATION OF TERRITORIES
A statement of the business of the
Patent Office for the year ended De
cember SI, 1903, of more than unusual
interest was transmitted to Congress
recently by the Commissioner of Pat
ents through the Secretary of the In
terior. The law requires the Commis
sioner of Patents to present a. report
of the business of his office for each
calendar year. The present Commis
sioner, Frederick I. Allen, has departed
from the usual custom in each of his
reports so far, and the document sent
out by him to-day has a number of in
teresting features. He states. In part:
"The business transacted by the Pat
ent Office during the calendar year 1903
has again exceeded all previous rec
ords, as appears in the foregoing ta
bles. The preceding statement show
ing the number of patents and certifi
cates of registration Issued from year

this office is an accurate Index x>f gen
eral conditions of prosperity in the in
dustrial arts of this country, and the
comparison hereinbefore made between
the chief financial and work elements
of this office for the years 1899 and 1903
permits the rate of this increase to be
accurately stated. From this statement
It appears that in four years the aver
age Increase of business, as shown by
the receipts, expenditures, applications
filed, issues and copies of patents and
records furnished, is 23j?er cent, and
this work has been accomplished with
an increase of 8.8 per cent in the num
ber of employes. The work has been

PATENT OFFICE
ANNUAL REPORT
"It was to me a matter of great in
terest last summer to be shown at Ber
lin the plans of the German govern
ment for an extension of their patent
office, which has been the first in Eu
rope â¢ to follow the procedure of this
country In the matter of granting
patents by the establishment of a sys
tem of preliminary 'examinations.
Lands have been purchased by the
German government and plans for
buildings are now in hand which are to
provide accommodations for two thou
sand employes, and It was stated to
me that such accommodation It was
thought would suffice for their neces
sities until the year 1920. It is interest
ing to notice that the annual issue of
patents by the German government is
about six thousand, and that our is
sue for the year 1903 was 31,690. It is to
be hoped that Americans will not be
obliged to look to Germany at any time
in the next decade to see the best em
bodiment in practice of the system of
issuance of patents upon preliminary
examinations. If they have concluded
that this system, originated by us, lies
so close to the national welfare that
they have decided to make great ex
penditures to possess themselves of its
benefits,' funds should not be wanting
in this country to keep our system up
to its present position of pre-eminence.
The stimulus given to the industrial
arts by the hope of reward which the
patent system presents to the inventor
is conceded by the thinking men of
most civilized countries to-day, and the
rapid progress of Japan has been ac
companied by the adoption of a patent
system In which they. were largely.in
fluenced by impressions derived from
an examination of the patent system of
the United States.
"At the present time the space pro-
Germany Follows Our Example.
"There is no reason to expect that
the increase shown in the foregoing
tables may not be found in the ensu
ing year, and it is evident that the
force of employes will not be able to
meet the requirements of an indefinite
further increase of the work unless
their number shall be correspondingly
increased. Already there are delays in
the transaction of our work and haste
in the execution of other portions of
the work, which point to the impera
1 tive necessity for more employes.
"The increase in work has made it
necessary to organize a new division,
known as the manuscript and photo
lithograph division, and there should
be added to the present force a new
chief of division and assistant chief
for the purposes of this new division.
I have also asked for ten additional
clerks of class one at $1200 per annum,
to meet our most urgent necessities.
"The increase of the appropriation
for the scientific library of this office
from $2000 to $2500, made by the ap
propriation bill of last year, was a
step in the right direction, and if this
sum can be further increased so as to
furnish $4000 per annum for the pur
poses of this library and for the trans
portation of publications of patents to
foreign governments I think the lib
rary can be maintained in a condition,
of efficiency.
"One cannot look at the progress of
the Patent Office since its present sys
tem of work was Inaugurated by the
act of July 4, 1836, without selng that
it has followed closely the develop
ment of the Industrial arts in this
country during all of this period, and
it should require no extended argu
ment beyond these figures to show that
the system which has/ accomplished
these results without expense to the
Government, but which has, on the
contrary, furnished a net balance of
$5,682,540 61, should be furnished with
all necessary facilities In the way of
room and employes bo as to permit its
future progress in the same measure
as the expected growth of the arts in
this country.
transacted as well as could be expected
in view of the force employed and the
volume of the work, and has been with
out particular incident.
Increase Will Continue.

THE ministers composing the Presbyterian Union in
this city have discussed the business man and
reached very uncomplimentary conclusions about
him. He does not go to church because business and
religion are incompatible. He finds it necessary to do
things that he ought to leave undone and to leave un
done those things that he ought to do. When reminded
of his shortcomings in the sermon he feels uncomforta
ble and therefore he stays out of earshot and the ser
mons do not reach him. One minister said: "I would
like to think of him as honest, true and upright, not
trying to do up his fellow men."
This is a quite serious matter. The charges are made
in order to account for the lack of business men in the
Sunday congregations. But does it'account for it? It is
the money of business men that builds the churches and
pays the salaries of the preachers. The same money
works mercy in the construction and equipment of hos
pitals and orphan asylums and homes for old people.
Hundreds of millions of the money of business men go
into these mercies and charities. Let us believe that it

showing herself to be one of the most

distinction of being married to a clever
man. her husband having been appoint

influence, but because he was regarded
es the man best fitted for the billet in
the ranks of the Conservative party.

France .are kept there all the winter,
the crews being brought out for them
every spring and taken back at the
end of the season.
The fishermen are made auxiliaries
for the warships. At 16 they are li
able for service, putting in two years
as beach boys at St. Pierre, to handle
the fish in the drying processes, and
then three years with the trawling
fieet on the banks. From this they
are drafted to the navy, if physically
fit; if rejected they continue at the
fishery.
Every year, about the middle of
March, these marine, conscripts as
semble at St. Malo and after being
enrolled and inspected are herded like
so much livestock aboard the trans
ports, which convey them out to St.
Pierre to be dispersed among the fish
ing vessels in which they work for
the summer. ,
During this period their lot Is hard.
They observe no Sabbath and enjoy
no relaxation. From daylight till
dark and oftentimes for hours afte>
they toll without ceasing, subject to
the caprice or brutality of drunken
or heavy-handed skippers, and living
amid the most squalid surroundings.
They sleep in foul smelling, ill light
ed Quarters, without sanitation or
cleanliness, sheaves of straw their
beds end salt bars their coverlets.
Their fare is the coarsest, their rai
ment the scantiest, their recompense
the smallest. ' ..â¢/">Â¦
Human life is cheap on these French
bankers. The death roll of the fleet
runs Into hundred annually, and it Is
asserted by the American, Canadian
and Newfoundland bankers that the
French skippers, in many instances,
will not trouble to search for drift
away dorymen, manifesting absolute
indifference to their fate.
Certain it is that the most unsea
worthy craft is used In the fishery by
them, for when vessels are condemned
by other nationalities they can be sold
at St. Pierre and are outfitted for the
banks from that port. The conse
quence Is. that when the region is be
set by storms the losses to the French
through these crazy craft and their
rotten gear Is great.
Thus, when the hurricane which de
vastated Galveston in the autumn of
1900 swept up the Atlantic seaboard
and spent its last rage on the Grand
Banks the Gloucester fleet escaped
with the loss of one vessel â the Cora
S. McKay â and 23 men; the Nova
Scotian fleet with three vessels and
41 men, and the Newfoundland fleet
with two vessels and 22 men, while
the French fleet lost 24 vessels and 289
menâ blotted out of existence in one

NEW YORK has protested against Judge Parker.
The protest was made by a delegated meeting in
Cooper Union and Mr. Bryan did it. He was
ovated on his appearance and it must be said that from
his standpoint he made a strong presentation, but the
facts he made use of are of common knowledge. *
It is plain to every political observer that Judge Par
ker is the candidate of the disgruntled trusts which seek
to avenge themselves upon President Roosevelt for en
forcing the law. David B. Hill is playing the game
which The Call predicted. He winks one eye at the
Socialists and the other at the capitalists and expects
them to join ballots in electing him to be the actual
President with Parker as an automaton. Mr. Hearst
sees this game and is trying to play it himself. Recently
he has taken up the fight of speculative Wall street and
lias announced editorially the sad plight of the specula
tive brokers who complain that no pickings are left in
the street for them because of the subsidence of specula
tion. But for all that Mr. Bryan evidently inclines
toward Hearst as an alternative to Judge Parker.
Mr. Bryan gave the country one surprise in his
speech. He said that while he felt deeply he always
restrained himself in the expression of his feelings. All
the world wonders what he would do if he let himself
out if his past course has been the result of restraintl
The platform adopted by the meeting denounces the ex
pansion policy of the Republican party, though Mr.
Bryan is responsible for the ratification of the treaty of
Paris which is the foundation of the policy complained
of.
The amazing and confusing divisions of the party ap
pear in the indorsement by one wing- of Judge Gray of
Delaware, who helped make the Paris treaty as commis
sioner and voted for it as Senator, and the favor in
which Olney is held in New England, though his remark
able letter advising that the United States go forward as
a world power was the strongest expansion document
that has been printed. No doubt the national platform
will condemn expansion, though Mr. Hearst will be
second in the number of instructed delegates and his
1898 shriek of "Nail the- flag to the Philippines" is yet
among the noise made by the Spanish war. In all of
our political history there is not another case of such
hypocrisy or foljy as this attempt to impeach the Re
publican party for a policy that had its radix in a Demo
cratic demand.
Mr. Bryan got* down to cases when he charged Judge
Parker's backers with buying delegations and cited the
purchase of the Cincinnati convention in proof. This
direct charge of corruption is the most serious thing in
his speech. The country does not want a candidate for
whom State delegations have been bought. Mr. Bryan
holds a conspicuous position. He has been twice the
candidate of his party for the Presidency and has been
it? unquestioned leader since 1896. The candidate of a
great party for the Presidency is invested with a certain
dignity and responsibilty although he has been defeated.
The country will be loth to believe that Mr. Bryan is a
deliberate liar and prefers to think that he tells the truth
when he charges the managers of Judge Parker with
trying to secure his nomination by corruption and
bribery.
This charge, then, must stand until it is disproved. It
leaves, the leading candidate in a very bad position and
puts him outside the sympathy and support of citizens
who will not permit degradation in the scramble for the
first office of the republic. On the other hand are the
charges of the same kind of corruption against Mr.
Hearst, who is at this time the second choice of the
party if the number of instructed delegates measure the
party's preference. This charge is not made on as high
authority as .Mr. Bryan, but it is in the air in every State
in which Hearst's managers have made a showing. In
California as good authority as General Green advised
every delegate to the State convention who voted to in
struct for Hearst to get a price equal to the value of his
reputation. In Milwaukee a man has brought a personal
suit against Hearst for a sum of money promised him
for his influence, and. if it be tried soon there will be
added an interesting chapter to the history of Demo
cratic demoralization.
These incidents measure the fall of a great party. The
decline of the party began in 1806 and has been progres
sive until its two leading candidates for the Presidency
stand accused of trying to buy the nomination. Under
tuch circumstances the platform declarations of policy
and denunciations of the Republican party will have an
empty sound. The record raises an issue of morals that
is of more importance than contentions over finance and
tariff. The party stands self-accused of corrupting it
self. How" idle then is the claim that a party which
moves on a nomination with a hand full of bribes can
purify public administration 1
No American rejoices that this record is made, but
every self-respecting American will be moved to vindi
cate the purity and decency of politics by smiting into
deserved obscurity a party that accuses itself of these
sins against the body politic.

The Board of Regents of the University of California
have decided that the next secretary of the institution
must receive a salary commensurate with the import
ance of his position. While it is absurd to believe that
any one may be bought to be honest, it is of the essence
of reason to conclude that a man is strengthened in the
path of duty by an environment which is worthy of his
efforts and won by_ them.

Patriotism is a noble emotion which
lends Itself easily to the ridiculous.
A Boston woman has carried the fad
for ancestry societies to its legitimate
conclusion by heading a movement to
consolidate the grandchildren of the
war veterans of 1861-5. Her society
should have at least the merit of vol
uminous enrollment. It has already
led to suggestions for aunts of the he
roes of San Juan Hill, brothers-in
law of conscripts of the sixties and
first cousins once removed of Filipino
exterminators. Anything which Is
snobbery masquerading as historic in
terest of patriotism deserves bur
lesque. Patriotism, according to Dr.
Johnson. Is the last refuge of a scoun
drel. Socially it is rather the last ref
uge of a fool. Perhaps we can get
beyond the wars and organize all the
relatives of Carnegie heroes. A heroic
race needs no hero fund. A race of
patriots needs no patriotic gossip par
ties. Historical societies should be
composed of historians. Snobbishness,
pedantry and their kindred vices con
sist in putting an over-emphasis on
some one possession or distinction,
and the smaller the trait celebrated
the pettier the vice. Pedantry, which
is. the vanity of knowledge, is there
fore a step or two above snobbishness,
which is the vanity of class. The sin
gular fertility shown by the gene
alogy societies in devices for making
themselves ridiculous is to be explain
ed by the absurdity of the motives
on which they are founded. Lavlnia
I, queen of the Holland Dames, and
her theatrical career were a natural
outcome of the pseudo-patriotic move
ment. In organizations rlimsily found
ed, flimsy people get to the top. The
Boston woman and her new burlesque
will be well employed if they hasten
the end of queens, daughters and
dames. Our librarians are kept busy
furnishing books to ladles who wish
to dig up remote ancestry for social
glamor. â Collier's Weekly.

NEWS comes from the East that the Congressional
Shipping Committee, appointed at the last session
to make investigations and report upon plans for
the upbuilding of the American merchant marine, is to
conclude its labors by i visit to our own city. Arriving
in San Francisco about July 15 this committee of legisla
tors from both houses of Congress purposes to devote
a week to the study of existing phases of commerce as
exemplified by the present status of ocean trade with
Hawaii, the Philippines and the Far East that is made
manifest by the shipping records of our harbor.
The coming of the Shipping Committee means much
to San Francisco; it means much to the advocates of an
enlarged merchant marine throughout the country.
Since the impetus given Pacific Coast trade by the ac
quisition of the Philippines and the opening up of China
this is the first direct recognition of our growing impor
tance as the gateway to the Orient given us by the na
tional legislative body. By their coming to this port for
statistics and advice upon the conditions of the Pacific
merchant marine the Congressional committee, acknowl
edges that its deliberations would be incomplete without
a thorough investigation into conditions extant in this
the chief base for a coming era of commercial activity.
This is San Francisco's opportunity to make a direct
bid for the prosperity of the future.
All should be in readiness for expediting the labors of
the committee's members. We have commercial bodies
whose statistics are direct evidence of the growing ac
tivity of the Pacific trade. Our Board of Trade, the
Harbor Commissioners, the Merchants' Exchange and
the Chamber of Commerce have it incumbent upon all of
them to bring before the eyes of the Congressional vis
itors the present condition and future prospects of the
tide of commerce that sweeps through the Golden Gate
out to the West. Certainly no proof of the needs of San
Francisco for a merchant marine flying the stars and
stripes is lacking; we have only* to display them con
vincingly.
Of course the Shipping Committee does not come
forearmed with instructions to determine the practica
bility or otherwise of the ship subsidy bill. That
measure is still pending in Congress under all manner of
obstructions and the creation of the present committee is
in the nature of a compromise to the strife now being
waged anent the subject. But the Congressional Com
mittee will arrive in San Francisco after the Republican
National Convention has incorporated in its platform a
strong expression in favor of the re-creation of our mer
chant marine. The Foraker bill providing for such by
the adoption of the ship subsidy policy must gain great
strength from the fiat of the Republican party platform.
We of San Francisco must urge it upon our visiting Con
gressmen that not until the Government shall have
adopted the measures which are now making Germany a
close rival of England on. the seas can we hope for an
American merchant marine that can compete with its
rivals on even terms.

A Salt Sea Yarn.
Never yet was sailor man who could
not outdo Munchausen and here is a
reeking tale of the sea that proves
the assertion. Said the old beach
comber:
"We were off the coast of Labrador
in the brig Jane the winter of *6S when
'twas cold enough to freeze the smoke
from the* galley pipe. 'Long about
seven bells in the morning watch I
was pacing the narrow runway abreast
the foc's'le when all of a sudden there
was a terrible crash and the brig seem
ed to drop out from under me.
"For a few minutes the smashing of
timbers and the rain of top hamper
that fell around me made me think it
was all off with me. Then I found
myself tossed like a cnlp and thrown
into the air like a bullet from a gun.
"When I came to my senses I looked
about. It was just daybreak. I could
make out a great white mass all strewn
with wreckage. I saw a piece cf the
galley nestling into a crevice in the
iceberg, for that was what I was on.
Well, to shorten sail a bit on this yarn.

Do the clergy find no need of introspection, of self
examination? There is a growing belief that the congre
gations would be larger if the preaching were better.
No man is so concerned about his soul that he will de
vote his Sunday to listening to an uninteresting, badly
delivered and prosy sermon. We are of the opinion that
if a Beecher, or Collier, or Elias Hicks, or Chapin, or
Talmadge had a pulpit in San Francisco he would not
complain of a small Sunday congregation. While
preachers of the established church in London read the
service to but a few hearers Spurgeon filled his taber
nacle at every service, and he was noted for not sparing
the feelings or glossing over the sins of business men or
anybody else.
In ancient Jewry the prophets had audiences and their
great voices sound sonorously over centuries of time.
They were not preaching doctrines but conduct, and it
is evident that in their day business men had as many
faults as they have now. But the messages that reached
them from the preacher were invested with a power that
was irresistible. The clergy are no doubt faithful and
devoted. If men are running away from their ministra
tions, per automobile or regular train, it is their business
not to complain of it but to bring them back,

"The plans under way for the South

is apparently misunderstood. ? The pres

"The general situation, it seems to
me, is excellent. There seems now to

showing better. Money is more plen

a prelude to a season of general pros

Special Dispatch to The Call,
Black was a member of the Scottish
Society of Oakland, and will be buried
by that organization. Besides his
widow, two children survive him. Their
ages are 4 and 6 years.
Mrs. Turner, the. landlady of the
house where MIkb Hunt resides, said
that the girl had been living there for
a month and that no man had visited
her during that period.
Mrs. James Black, when seen at her
home in Oakland, said that ehe did not
know what Impelled her husband to
take his life unless It was the knowl
edge that he had ruined his business
through spending all his money on
Miss Hunt. She told the following
story:
I was married to Black ten years ago. About
three years ago he opened a women's tailor
ing establishment at 630 Fourteenth Ktrcet and
employed Miss Hunt to assist him. From that
time he began to neglect the children and
myself and to spend all his money on her.
Although she knew I was aware of her eon
duct, she 6eemed to have no shams and would
wait until my hueband was ready to dose thÂ«
shop and then the two would go away to
gether.
My husband's Infatuation for this woman
continued until he was so deeply In debt that
he had to sell out his business last March.
Two weeks ago he W-ft home to go to San
Francisco aa he said, to go to work. Before
he left I begged him to break with Miss Hunt
and he told me that be had seen her for the
last time.
MRS. BLACK'S STATEMENT.
Yesterday morning whtn I came down town
he Joined me and tried to drag me down the
etreet. lie said: "You have got to go with
me. or either you or I or both of us have got
to die." Finally we walked down Sutter street
to Powell, and he pulled out a pistol and
threatened to shoot me. but he said that if I
would meet him again last night he would let
me go. I promised to do bo. as I was afraid
of my life. He then shoved the pistol into my
face and said. "Will you kill me?" I took the
pistol and threw it into the street and screamed
for help. In the meantime two men who had
been walking near us tried to get the pistol,
but Black was too quick for them and got It
first and put it back into his hip pocket. Offi
cer Smith Carr rushed up at this time. Black
was standing in the middle of the street, and.
putting the gun to his ear. shouted out, "Don't
come rear me or I will kill myself." Carr
made a jump for Black, but the latter made a
darh down Sutter street and rushed up Powell
rtreet hill toward Bush street. I heard two
shots and then I became partially unconscious,
but was supported by passersby.
In regard to the statements made by Mrs.
Black in reference to me. I declare emphati
cally that fche never spoke to me upon the sub
ject of her husband. I did not go out with
Black. My life has been a burden since I
knew him. I am cow almost a nervous wreck
from his attentions and from the constant
fear that at any moment he would take my
life. After I refused time and again to go
with him he said he would get a divorce from
his wife. I told him divorce or no divorce, I
did not want anything to do with htm. Many
times I thought that I would appeal to the
police and havÂ« him arrested. I knew this act.
however, would only bring notoriety upon him,
his family and myself. That is all that pre
vented me from making a complaint.
Mr. Black has been bothering me for more
than six months, and during this whole time
1 have been in a state of terror from his threats
to kill both himself and me. I never encour
aged hi* attentions, nor did I want anything at
all to do with him. On Monday night as 1 was
enterinf my home, and at the very instant my
landlady was opening the door. Black rushed
up the steps. " grabbed me by the arm, pulled
me down the stairs and dragged me up to Van
Ness avenue. He begged me to come with him
and I again told him that I never would have
anything to do with, him. I had told him this
a hundred times before, lie became to violent
in 1 is language that he nearly scared me to
death. A policeman happened to be passing
and I rushed to him for assistance. Me es
corted me to my house, and all the while Black
was wildly gesticulating at me. As I ran up
t^Â» etairs he said: "You may escape to-night,
Itt I will kill you to-morrow."
AXXOYED HER FOR MONTHS.
Determined, however, that he should
not be baffled. Black was waiting for
the girl yesterday morning when she
left her home at 1212 Sutter street to
ro to her work. Once more he made
his plea and once more was repulsed.
Their controversy on the sidewalk at
Powell and Sutter streets lasted long
and became heated. A crowd collect
ed, drawn by the sight of a frenzied
man waving a revolver and threaten
ing to shoot himself. Several police
men were seen approaching.
Brought thus to bay and desperate
because his suit was rejected. Black
turned from Miss Hunt and ran up
Powell street with his revolver in his
hand. Policeman Harry Hook followed
him and fired his revolver in the air.
Instantly Black stopped, put his pistol
to his temple and fired. He fell on the
sidewalk, but life was not at once ex
tinguished and an ambulance was sum
moned. On the way to the hospital he
expired. His remains were removed to
the Morgue.
Miss Hunt is an attractive blonde
about 20 years of age. As she sat yes
terday in the workshop where she is
employed she told the following story
of her connection with the tragic af
fair:
On Monday evening, preceding the
tragedy, Miss Hunt and her persist
ent wooer had a scene on the street.
His oft-repeated demands were again
renewed and again the young woman
repulsed him. Finally she refused
flatly to have anything further to do
with him.
.WATTED FOR HER.
- James Black, In a fit of desperation
because Miss Ethel Hunt would not
live with him, blew out his brains yes
terday morning on Powell street, just
above Sutter. Black was a married
man, a tailor by occupation and re
sided at 1456 Filbert street, Oakland.
Miss Hunt Is a seamstress In the em
ploy of the Quillinan women's tailor
ing shop at 715 Sutter street.
The suicide followed an exciting in
terview that took place yesterday
morning- between Black and Miss Hunt
on Sutter street and which lasted for
over an hour. The meeting*, of the
couple was witnessed by a number of
people residing on that street, between
Taylor and the place of shoot-
Ing. The Immediate events that led
up to the shooting were sensational.
The heated altercation between the
two principals attracted the attention
of everybody in that vicinity.
As to the suicide, there are conflict
ing statements. Miss Hunt alleges
that she has been persecuted by Black
for six months because she would not
live with him and that he has often
threatened to kill her and himself if
she would not accede to hi3 wishes.
On the other hand, Mrs. Black, the
widow of the suicide, states that Miss
Hunt lured her husband away from
his home and after she had got all
the money she could get out of him
she wanted to cast him off.

PATTOSIEN'S
HANDSOME NEW STORE.
One of the best known business en-
terprises of California is Pattosicn's
big furniture store at Sixteenth and
Mission streets. In the furniture
buyers' eyes this business center has
many charms, firstly because of the
low prices there prevailing, secondly
because of the quality and immensity
of goods on display and lastly be-
cause of *he courteous and honorable
treatment afforded all customers.
During the illness of W. J. Patto-
sien, which seemed to be a long
drawn out affliction, a gigantic sale
was conducted, a sale which has never
been equaled in this State.
Renewed health and the old longing
for aggressive business have encour-
aged Mr. Pattosien to purchase the in-
fterests of his colleagues. Large
orders were placed with the factories
in the East, upon the arrival of which
Mr. Pattosien reopened the old store
in splendid style with newer and bet-
ter goods. The public of San Â£ran-
cisco is respectfully invited to renew
old acquainfances at the Pattosien
headquarters in the Mission.

CRACK SWIMMERS TO MEET
IN ANNUAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
Boxer Dave Barry Returns.
Dave Barry and "Cyclone" Kelly,
the boxers, were among the arrivals
yesterday from Honolulu. Barry had
eight fights in the islands and won
them all. He is anxious to meet
Twin" Sullivan and the match has
been offered to the Tosemite Club for
this month.
Two runs credited to Portland were
a present from Judge Smith. Mc-
Creedie rapped out a double and when
Smith attempted a quick return of
Thielman's warm one he threw the
ball into the bleachers. McCreedle
and Thlelman both scored while the
search for the lost ball was under way.
Ross made a pretty double play in
pulling down Francis* high one and
catching McCreedie at the plate by
a strong throxr.
Pitcher Baum must have subsidized
Butler to hand them to him without
kinks, for he lined one out in the third
that was good for three bags and,
connected in the seventh for a double
and in the eighth for a single. The
score:

Â«rerÂ» by Spies and Baum of Morley's
Loo Loos off Butler's delivery when
the came looked good for the locals
clouded the sun for the big pitcher.
Flood then batted safely and the score
was tied. It was too much for "Bad
InnlnÂ«: Dee" and the visitors found
him easy In the eighth and ninth and
won. Eleven singles, two doubles and
a triple were to the credit of Los An
ecles when the ruction ended. Baum's
delivery \ras touched up, but the hits
were not bunched, save twins in the
fourth.
Bartenders' League No. 41 contributed
the sum of $10 to the stablemen's strike
fund, and a similar amount was - do
nated to a sick member. KiiS^
G. W.' Brown, whose livery stable Is
at 1S7 Stevenson street, received a
couple of visitors Monday night in the
form of two basalt blocks that came
through his windows. He boards his
men in the stable, and as
they were sitting down to supper the
rocks made their way into the place.
The stable owners of this city in their
troubles with the Stablemen's Union
intend to follow the lead of E. G/ Pierce
of the Nevada Stables and sue for In
junctions restraining the union from
picketing and boycotting their places of
business. The unions have withdrawn
their men from the sidewalks - before
the tabooed stables, and .probably no
more pickets will be seen between now
and the hearing of the temporary in
junctlyn case before Judge Hunt on
July 1. .
A committee from the union met the
representatives of the Citizens' Alliance
yesterday. In their discussion, the two
parties disagreed principally -on the
"open shop" question, and the matter
will stand unchanged until after the
injunction hearing. â¢

The Justices of the Peace are much
worried over a complaint made that
they had refused to try cases assigned
to Justice of the Peace Dunn while
he was ill. Judge Van Nostrand says
in answer to the complaint that he
has tried thirty or forty cases set for
trial before Dunn, and Judge Lawson
points to the fact that he has nine
cases belonging to Dunn set for trial
to-day. Dunn has gone on his vaca
tion and all his cases will be heard
by the other Justices during his ab

"Would you have me close my doors
to a policeman whose tongue was hang
ing out with thirst?" asked the tender
hearted purveyor of mixed and plain
beverages.
Thereupon Mr. Howell caustically re
marked that Ferguson was too sym
pathetic. The motion was made and
carried that the licenses of all saloon
keepers who give or sell drinks to offi
cers in uniform shall be revoked.
Edward Hoffman, who conducts a
"paint shop" at 623 Sacramento street,
was asked to explain why he tapped
upon the cranium of J. DambrosWy
with a hammer. Hoffman replied that
he did not do so to sound the solidity
of DambroÂ«ky's skull.
"I was going to tap a wine keg, 1 *' he
said. *'I tapped Mr. Dambrosky by
mistake.".
The Commissioners looked with In
terest upon the man whose head was
mistaken for a wine cask. They agreed
that the error was venial.
The charges against the Fawn Saloon
conducted by A. H. Becker were dis
missed. J. Baxter complained that he
had been robbed there two weeks ago.
Policeman A. C. Marsh was fined J5
for missing a target practice. Thomas
H. Dowd was appointed a patrolman.
It was an artlesa remark made by
Thomas Ferguson, proprietor of a sa
loon at 534 California street, thajt caused
Commissioner Howell to introduce the
resolution. - V :
Xo saloon-keeper shall play the Good
Samaritan to policemen in uniform, so
the Police Commissioners unanimously
decided last night. If a wearer of the
blue appear on the threshold of a sa
loon tortured by cramps, toothache, ap
pendicitis, paresis, paralysis or any of
the other ills the force is heir to, fhe
saloon man who furnishes liquid relief
f$r the sufferers must say farewell to
his license.

SHEEPSHEAD BAY ENTRIES.
SEATTLE, June 21.â San Francisco
made a whirlwind finish, but could
not quite catch Seattle in to-day's
game. Charlie Hall, the Ventura lad,
pitched a lucky game up to the sev
enth inning. That San Francisco had
a long row of poose egg? was due to
the sensational fielding of the men be
hind Hall at critical points rather
than to his magnificent pitching. In
the seventh, with two men on bases.
Miller hit the ball to third. Dele
hanty touched the bag and threw to
first ahead of the runner. Umpire
Brown would not allow the double,
claiming the ball went foul. Seattle
was so far in the lead that she did
not make a serious kick. San Fran
cisco immediately set the ball rolling
and with a couple of hits and errors
by Brashear and R. Hall got five runs.
In the ninth Meany and Irwin got hits
â¢which gave one run. after one was
out. Anderson reached first on R.
Hall's error, but Townsend struck out
end Wilson caught Anderson at sec
ond, saving the game for Seattle. The

In Jeffries' party were the champion's
wife, Mr. and Mrs. William Delaney
and Kid Eagan. After leaving the train
the party. went to the Gas Kitchen, of
which the champion's friend, John
Marcovich. is proprietor, for dinner.
Upon completing the repast Jeffries
proceeded to the Hotel Metropole. where
Eugene Van Court and a few intimate
acquaintances of the boxer visited him
in his apartments. â¢
Kid Kagran, who was with Jeffries
during his stay of two months at Har
bin Springs, said last night that the
big fellow was glad to get back to Oak-
Innd. where he could receive additional
medical attendance, as he was growing
somewhat impatient with the incon
venience caused him by his injured
knee. On the train Jeffries occupied
two seats in order to stretch and rest
his injured limb. Delaney and Easran
asserted that outside of seeing that Jef
fries' knee is restored to its normal
condition as soon as possible no other
plans have been mapped out for the
future. When Jeffries is again well and
strong, Earan stated, the party would
go back to Harbin Springs, if the
match with Munroe is a certainty, and
will commence the routine work of
training all over again.
Jack Jeffries and Joe Kennedy, who
acted as the champion's sparring mates
at Harbin Springs, came down from
there on Monday. Jack Jeffries left
immediately for his parents' home near
Los Angeles, while Kennedy came to
this city.
Champion James' J. Jeffrie's and party
arrived in. Oakland last evening from
Harbin Springs. After dining at the
Gas Kitchen the big pugilist limped to
the Hotel Metropole and went to bed,
where, according: to Dr. W. S. Porter,
who was called to treat the giant box
er's injured knee, Jeffries will probably
remain for some days. Three visits
were paid by the physician to the
.champion's apartments last night and
the lame leg was carefully examined
and bandaged. In speaking of Jeffries'
game limb Dr. Porter said:
"My examination disclosed consider
able swelling about the knee, due to
water gathered there. This causes the
stiffness of which the patient com
plains. Jeffries will have to give the leg
sufficient rest, or else the swelling may
increase and thus cripple him iqr some
time: As he is now, he would be like
a man going into a ring on crutches. It
may he that the injury will require Jef
fries to stay in bed ten days or two
weeks. We can tell better in a few
days what the outcome of the injury
will be. 'iC. Â¦': :Â¦ >.\

CHICAGO. June * 21.â There will be
no more horse racing at Washington
Park this year and a report was in
circulation to-night that the track will
be abandoned. The stand taken by the
city authorities prohibiting betting In
any form at the track is responsible
for the curtailment of the present
meeting. With the elimination of the
bookmakers racegoers refused to pat
ronize the track. During the last two
days not enough money was taken in
at the gates to pay the employes of
the track, to say nothing of the purses
for the racing, which amounted to an
average of $4000 a day. After the races
had been run off to-day the directors
of the club held a meeting to consider
the advisability of continuing the
meeting for the full twenty-five days,
despite the large sums of money that
would be lost. The decision was reachr
ed to close the gates for the present
meeting at least. The announcement
was made by Secretary Howard that
all stakes left to be decided had been
declared off. Among the stakes left
undecided are the Hyde Park stakes,
the Sheridan handicap, the Young han
dicap and the Wheeler handicap. A
proposition was made to Secretary
Howard to run some of these stakes
at the other tracks, but It was refused,
Howard declaring that If they could
not be decided at Washington Park
they would not be run at all.
It is probable a special meeting of
the Western Jockey Club will be called
at once and the remaining dates of the
South Side course will be apportioned
to the other three race tracks, which
are just outside the city limits.
The Lakeside stakes, worth $2900 to
the winner, was taken by The Mist in
the feature event on the five-race card
to-day. La Londe was second and Re
gale third. Beau Ormonde and Phil
Finch furnished the most sensational
finish of the meeting in the- fourth
race. They raced head and head all
through the final eighth, the farmer
getting up in time to win by a head.

Santa Clara County is giving two |
! cooked prunes each to 2000 people a]
i day now at Its prune palace, and this
'flood cf customers will become vastly
! greater as the days go on. The giving
I away of thl* delicious fruit is drawing
hundreds to the Palace of Agriculture,
and thousands are learning the excel
lence of California prunes. A box of
uncooked prunes lies open for all who
wish to taste them In that form. The
samplers are mostly ladies, and all ex
press the highest appreciation of the
size and flavor of thi3 California pro
duct- Merchants from various cities
have watched the demonstration and
congratulated the San Jose people on
their socceÂ«s. "The only way," they
say. "to pet an article properly before
"Bring me that tank of spray,"
shouted Commissioner Hyde of Santa
Clara, who is never lost in an emer
gency.
Some cne brought the exhibit of Quid
used to extinguish the San Jose scale,
and Hyde pumped the young waybacks
full of it. They sat up, and the emer
gency ambulajice was sent for. The
Wayback family wound up its day's
celebration at the hospital.
All this time Childs had been busily
at work on -an arithmetical problem.
He arose and addressed Hyde. I
"It'll take seven unfon !abor men
working nine hours a day four days
and eight hours," he said, "to replace
those prunes; and, worse than that. I'm
all out of aclda for the. preserving
fluid."
AMBtXA2>Â»*CE IS CALLED.
"Oh, yes. madam," replied Childa
briskly. "We pipe it all the way from
San Jose."
Mrs. Wayback's exclamation of as
tonishment was drowned by four
groans of agony from around the cor
ner of the palace, followed by a pot
pourri of shrieks. Everybody rushed
around there and found the four lit
tle Waybacks writhing on the floor
with their hands on their stomachs.
Two square feet of prunes were rnlas
ins from the wall, tacks and all.
The old couple ate prunes with a j
relish and then took a long drink of !
the clarified Mississippi broth that |
runs from the faucet at the Santa .
Clara demonstrating Â«tand.
'That's California water, too, 1 1
guess." said Mrs. Wayback.

CALL BUREAU, WORLDS FAIR.
ST. LOUIS. June 21. â Uncle Jasper ;
"vTayback of Last Chance. Ark., stood j
with his wife and the four Juvenile j
Waybacks in front of Santa Clara
County's goregous "palace of prunes"
in the California exhibit- They had |
been told of it over in Last Chance [
and it was their first quest after they j
had got by the gold brick and wiener
wurst men at the portals and stood
amidst the dazzling wonders of the i
exposition. [
"I wonder, Jasper, could them be {
real prunes?" asked Mrs. "Way back, j
dizzied by the prodigal use of fruit for |
building purposes.
"Must be, liaria," said Jasper,
equally astonished. "I guess there
ain't nuthin* to beat this in the hull
fair. Why, there must be $400 wuth
of prunes there. That 'd buy a farm."
"Mister, are them real prunes
there?" demanded Mrs. Wayback of
Lloyd Childs. custodian of the ex
hibit.
"Yes, indeed, madam," replied
Childs. Â«
"Good to eat?"
"Finest in the world; come in and
try some."
Jasper Wayback and his wife
passed into the prune palace. The
Juvenile Waybacks took their finger3
from their mouths. Enlightenment
had burst upon them.
E. Thelen, the National City banker,
and his brothers, Conrad Thelen of Ne
braska and Gus Thelen of Germany,
are holding a pleasant reunion at the
fair. They had not met before In many
years.
R. C. Baird of the Bank of Califor
nia is visiting the exposition.
G. TV". Marsh of San Francisco is her*
to install the exhibit to be made by
his firm in the San Francisco building.
Janney went home, satisfied with his
wcrk. A few days ago C. A. Black of
San Miguel, who is the commissioner
for the two counties, came tere with
his wife. They had convulsions when
they ?aw the "birds* nest." Black at
once had rlans drawn for an ornate
mission structure. It will have three
pillars in front, and on top will be two
pyramids for preserved fruit. It will
be finished in white, with decorations
of poppies and natural long moss un
der the direction of Mrs. Black. The
structure will be finished in a few
days.
About 100 pounds of prunes are being ;
given away each day now. Fourteen j
tons have been gent on by growers, and Â¦
more will be forwarded when needed, j
There is no limit to the supply for dis- .
tribution purposes, as this is to be the j
feature of Santa Clara's work at the\
fair. Half a million pamphlets with j
recipes for cooking prunes and other j
dried fruits properly are to be given ;
away. The Prune Palace perhaps bear3 j
more dried apricots and peaches on its j
walls than it does prunes, but the lat- I
ter fruit shows more prominently be-j
cause of its color, and gives the struc
ture Its name.
REBUILDING TIIEIR BOOTH. f
San Luis Obispo and 'Monterey coun
ties are rebuilding their booth in the
California exhibit. They have decided i
that the first structure erected Is utter- I
ly unworthy of their importance and I
progress. They have torn It down and
have nearly completed a booth that
will be as fair to look upon as any.
R. L. Janney of Paso Robles, who
came here first as representative of!
these two counties, had artistic ideas [
of his own. He erected what he called j
a "grape arbor." but which looked like |
an Indian shack on the plains of New
Mexico. Under this were displayed the j
jars of fine fruit and other exhibits sent
on by San Luis Obispo and Monterey.
The other county commissioners looked
askance at the structure and referred I
to it as the "birds' nest." Its roof waa
a cereal thatch.
the public. The sale of Santa Clara j
rruns should increase." Frenchmen :
from the French section in the build- i
ing have sampled and confessed that Â¦
their country produces no better j
prunes.

The "toy pistol committee" is
armed with alarming statistics culled
from the Journal of the American
Medical Association, showing the ex
tent of the injuries sustained through
the use of explosives last year.
Mrs. Johnson, speaking for the com
mittee, says that there i3 a city ordi
nance here against the sale of toy
pistols and explosives- to minors un
der 17, but it is violated ont only fcy
the merchant but also by the ! fond
mother, who. having no heart to re
fuse her offspring anything in the
world, heeds his pleading and places
the danger in his hand, blind to the
possible fatal result.
A movement is on foot, instigated
by the "toy pistol committee" of the
California Club and of which Mrs. T.
J. Johnson is chairman, to educate
citizens to the danger of the toy pistol
and ail explosives in the hands of
minors. In view of the near approach
of the Fourth of July celebration
every effort is being bent toward
reaching not only parent3, but those
who sell explosives, in the hope that
caution and advice may have good
effect in the matter.

bids would be op3ned. Subsequent to
that date an award was made to
Wheaton, Pond & Harold. As a conse
quence, it is claimed the State will
Io?e more than $2000. - .
The complaint is a lengthy one and
in effect alleges that awards for the
supplies for the use of the institution
were granted to Wheaton. Pond & Har
old, although this firm's bid was cotr
siderably higher thin that ma.de by
the A. L. Lundy Company for the
same products.
The board of managers of the Xapa
State .Asylum for the Insane has been
temporarily restrained from granting
to Wheaton. Pond <& Harold a contract
for supplying butter," cheese and eg,g3
to the asylum -for the- ensuing year.
The restraining order was issued yes
terday by Superior Judge Seawell. upon
the application of Louis Titus, who is
acting as attorney for the A. L. Lundy
Company, dealers in produce and pro
visions at 121 Davis street.;
The tig freight steamer Algca wu
more seriously damaged by striking on
the sunken rocks oil Point Bonita than
tne first opinion of experts foreshad
owed. She was floated into Hunters
Point drydock tarly yesterday morn
ing, where she now lies as helpless as
a wounded sea monster.
When the great pumps en the dock
tterted to draw the water from under
the freighter the enormous mass of
eteel groaned and complained like a
living thing- As though protesting
against bein^ left stranded out of its
?â¢leraer.t. the vessel suddenly lurched
to the starboard. Hurriedly Thomas
P. H. YThitela'A-, who h2s charge of the
operation, cave the order to flood the
docks, letting the Algoa rest easily
once more on the massive operating
table for damaged ships.
Again, but more gently, the water
-*as withdrawn from beneath the hull
to Â» depth of twelve feet. At that
point the freighter once more displayed
u desire to turn turtle. Divers were
sect for. They came late in the after
noon and discov.-ren the cause of the
Aisc&'s strange action. They reported
;hat the bilge keel on the port side had
L>wn partly wrenched from the vessel
a.nd bent downward, preventing her
rettiiac comfortably. Two holes bitten
by the hidden teeth of Point Bonita
were lÂ«x-ated on the same side.
Wrecker White'aw believes he can
by to-morrou- clear away the tangled
ir..is$ that causes the list, that
â¢- d or.e the great ship will be left high
and dry until the holes are patched and
a new biisre keel is provided.
The Area's injuries were sustained
by bumping against the rocks off Point
Honita on the morning of June 7, while
trying to avoid a collision with the
schocner Compeer, outward bound.

Its contents, he says, saturated his
hat and dress suit and penetrated to
his under garments. Then the lamp
started a tire on the floor of the
car, endangering the lives of the
passengers, including the plaintiff,
but he heroically extinguished the blaze
to the ererlasting ruin of hi3 dress
gloves.
In spite of the accident Mr. and Mrs.
Aten proceeded to the theater and oc
cupied the Â«eats they had reserved, but
the comments of his neighboring play
poers concerning the redolence of re
fined oil were too much for his sensi
bilities and he left his seat and wife
to stand In the rear during the re
mainder of the performance. For the
damaged clothes he asks judgment in
the sum. of J30O ar.d for the discomfort
and humiliation $250 will do. Â¦
Dentist Aten recites, pointedly, that
on March 25 he and his wife started
ff:r_th<* Colombia "Theater "on a Va
lencia-street car. In the course of their
trip townwards a lamp dropped from
ita moorings and struck Mr. Aten upon
the head. ' Â¦ . '
These facts, including the values of a
dress suit and wounded pride, "are set
forth in a complaint for damages filed
yesterday in the Superior Court by W.
O. Aten. a dentist, against the United
Railroads. .
A man's outfit, frerar hat to nether
garment?, donned for theater array, is
worth $300. and such an autSt saturated
with Standard oil has an added value
of JÂ£50â the price that must be paid
for the discomfort and humiliation suf
fered because of an offensive odor. Its
a far cry from kerosene to attar of
roses, and while the blue book doesn't
specify what perfume a man shall use
when he goes to the play; It's a safe
guess that the odor of coal oil U not at
all In fashion.

COMMERCIAL NEWS
Under the existing law the veteran is
entitled to receive his pension, and does
receive it. but the new law, taking ef
fect July 1, requires the payment in a
lump sum to the treasurer of all pen
sions due to members of the home. The
directors are authorized to give to each
pensioner such amount as in their judg
ment he ought to receive, and the re
mainder is placed to his credit, to be
paid to him in full if he elects to take
his discharge from the home. It is ex
pected that quite a number of veterans
will leave the Yountville home next
month^
Profits that have hitherto accrued
from the canteen have been used main
ly to provide books, bands, amusements
and betterments for the members of the
home. Quite a large sum was expend
ed at Tountville to Increase the water
supply and provide equipment for the
new hospital. In order that the Gov
ernor and members of the State Legis
lature may be informed as to the dis
bursements in detail, the directors have
requested the experts of the State Board
of Examiners to examine the books and
accounts of the institution.
The directors governing the national
homes are convinced, however, that the
canteen does not promote intemper
ance, but, on the other hand, Is con
ducive to good order and discipline.
The fact exists, however, that the
Bell amendment prohibits the allow
ance of Federal money to any State
that permits a canteen to be main
tained, and as the Government allow
ance is 5100 per annum for every vet
eran-maintained at the home the di
rectors of the State institution at
Yountville have advised the national
board of management through Gov
ernor Pardee that the canteen will be
abolished. The State of California will
therefore continue to receive the usual
allowance of $100 per year for every
veteran cared for by the State.
FUND WAS NEEDED.
The law passed by Congress to abol
ish the canteen at State soldiers' homes
will take effect on July 1. At that time
the canteen at the California Home,
Tountville, will be closed, and there
after no wine, beer or alcoholic bev
erages of any kind will be sold on the
reservation.
Congressman Bell of the Second Dis
trict passed the law In the House. In
the Senate committee the bill was
amended so that the law would not ap
ply to national homes. Leading men
in the national Prohibition party high
ly commend Bell for his zeal in behalf
of the cause of temperance, and It
would not be surprising if he were in
dorsed for Vice President on the Prohi
bition ticket.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Alameda, Captain Dowdell, ar
rived yesterday from Honolulu with
256 passengers and 1300 tons of cargo.
Head winds were encountered for two
days but otherwise fine weather was
enjoyed throughout the passage.
Three Chinese women, teachers in
American schools in the Hawaiian Is
lands, were among the Alameda's pas
sengers. They are Miss Chung, Miss
See Long and # Mrs. Sam Wong. They
have come to the mainland to spend
their summer vacation. George B.
Greig, well known as the King of Fan
ning Island, and a frequent visitor to
San Francisco, was one of the Ala
meda's passengers. Mrs. Grelg and a
Â¦child accompanied him.
Charles L. Rhodes, a newspaper man
once well known in this city and now
city editor of .the Hawaiian Star, came
up on the liner, accompanied by his
wife. Rhodes Is an alternate delegate
from Honolulu to the Democratic con
vention at St. Louis and a delegate
from the diocese of Honolulu to the
General Convention of the Protestant
Episcopal church to be held next Oc
tober in Boston.
The Alameda. brought up the ashes
of Frank Smith, late manager of the
Hawaiian Hotel. He died June 9 of
typhoid fever. The remains of S. A.
D. Jones, the insurance man, who died
at Honolulu on June 14, were also
brought home on the Alameda. ~

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Top quality lots of new white and Early |
RoÂ»e Potatoes continued to meet with a brisk
demand at steady figures, but low-grade of
ferings were inclined to easiness, as receipts
were heavy and the carry-over from the pre
ceding day was rather large. Fancy Early
Rose were quoted higher and a few lots of
whites, which were competed for by rival Job
bers, continued to command the usual pre
mium. Red Onions were In free supply and
weak at a wider range of prices, while Silver
sklna were firmer.
Most kinds of miscellaneous vegetables were
In free supply and prices showed considerable
revision. Green Corn in crates from Ala
nioiia was offering freely and sold off well at
good figures. Sacked stock, too. met with *
fair Inquiry, but as supplies were plentiful
prices had a wider range. Southern Tomatoes
were firmer under light receipts and Summer
Squash In small boxes did better. Peas and
Brans continued to strengthen and fine Garden
Beans sold In e small way at 8e per pound.
New Green Peppers from Sacramento were ,
offering again and met with prompt sale. Chile
selling at 12%^ 13c and Bell at 20c per pound.

Poultry and Game.
No more Western Poultry was received, but
receipts of domestic stock were ample and the
market was rather eacy for everything except
the fanciest young stock, such as young Roos
ters and Fryers. California Hens were weak
at lower rates, as retailers were well supplied
with the recent heavy arrivals of Western.

Butler, Cheese and Eggs.
! The Butter market seems to be digesting the
recent heavy receipts without difficulty, as all ,
dealers quote the situation unchanged. The
retailers are complaining cf dullness owing to
thfi absence cf so many people from the city
during the numir.er vacation. Reports from
Lcs Angeles say that stocks of fresh and cold
storage Butter thert: are enormous, that there
' are also lanr<" lines of Eastern there or on the
way, whilr the San Joaquin Valley creameries
are sending In liberal quantities. Under these
circumstances this market need not expect to
ship any Hutter to I> Â¦< Angeles at present.
In f.olte of the Increased receipts of Cheese
from Oregon choice mild new grades are com- j
mandln? a small advance, as they are not plen
tiful. The lower grades continue weak.
Th<? situation In Ei?f!Â» Â«hows no change wor
thy of note. The feeling In fine ranch Is steady,
as this is the time of the year when the mar
1 ket generally takes its regular upward turn.
I Store Eggs, en the contrary. arÂ« weak, as the
hot summer weather in the Interior renders
them poorer than during the spring. Besides,
they have to compete with Eastern, which
have bven ccmiriff in very llbsrally of late. â¢ â¢

i clduouft fruits far In excess of the demand the
general market had an easy tone and prices a
downward tendency. Cherries were the ex
ception and the light receipts cleaned up well
' at the recently advanced quotations. White
Astrachan Apples continued to meet with a
steady demand at the top quotation, but the
market was dull for common offerings, which
were In liberal supply. Peaches. Aprlcotr,
' Plums and Pears In small packages were weak
and large lines of all descriptions could be
had In the afternoon at or near the minimum
quotations. Apricots In bulk were firmly held
and small sales- were reported for canning ac
count at $.'I0i&40 i'<"" ton. One small lot of
' poor fruit was taken by a canner at S22 50
per ton. Grapes were dull at $1O1 50 per
crate and Cantaloupes and Watermelons were,
easier owing to the cool, cloudy w?ather. An
other car of Watermelons arrived and the price
was reduced to 2c per pound.

NEW YORK. June 21. â There wan little more
than a drift of prices of stocks to-day Inter
spersed with periods of Idleness not inappropri
ate to the solstice and the tradition of summer
dullness In the stock market. If any effect was
produced on sentiment by the beginning of the
convention reason of the great political parties,
dullness was the enly evidence of it In the
market. The subject was not discussed. The
undertone continued firm and there were spots
of special strength which helped the general
tone.- The Canadian group was a conspicuous
example. Canadian Pacific and Its subsidiary
companies making notable advances on buying
attributed to Canadian account and accompa
nied by reports of large profits- from land sales
and popslble chances of a dividend, calculated
without mentlcn of any official authority. Lon
don prices came higher this morning, but were
without much effect on the opening here. Lon
don also turned seller here promptly, espe
cially of Southern Pacific. The immobility of
that Ktock and of Union Pacific were features
of the market after their recent activity and
feverlfch fluctuation*. * The quietude was rather
reassuring than otherwise, as the disposition
to sell Southern Pacific since the announcement
of the preferred stock Issue has had 'an 'un
settling Influence on the whole market. The
event of the day In which most* interest was
sht.wn wss the publication of the weekly bul
letin of the Weather Bureau of. the country'*
crnps. The very favorable reports of both the
winter and spring wheat crops caused a break
In the wheat market and Induced mme buying
of the grange! stocks. A rise of *4 in Atchl
eon measured the extreme -of the movements.
Bonds were fins, hut . rather dull. Total
eales, par value, $2,375,000. * '.

; most completely a severe break In prices, the
.result of bearish crou - advices. . At-the. close
September wbeat was down only h shade.
September corn is up Oats gained Sc
.and provisions 7%{jlOc. \
Firm cables nod additional rain In the
Southwest - had u bearish effect on the wheat
market at the opening. As a result initial
I sales were at a slight advance over yesterday's
' close, July being up a shade to Uit'luc at
' *4*ic to b5c. September was up a shade to
%4yÂ»ic at W)c to SOMiC. Pit traders, however.
were inclined to the selling side, and on the
slight advance sold' freely. A number of
â¢ bearish factors soon came Into prominence
I with the result that the market became ex
â¢ trcimely weak. One of the main Influences in
this respect was the weekly bureau report,
which pronounced all conditions favorable.
Another element was the report \f the Kansas
Secretary of. Agriculture, making^an estimate
of 83,400,000 bushels as the season's produc
tion, compared with bT.OCO.000 bushels last
year. Bctore the veiling pressure abated July
declined to 83*ic and September to 799Â»c.
Durln? the latter part of the session there
was active covering by (horts on a decrease
of over 2,000,lHKt bushels in visible supply.
Late in the day offerings becama quite scarce
and in consequence prices were easily forced
*up to the opening level. Sentiment was firm
at the close. Final quotations on July were up
a shade at 84%c. September closed 79%c
j Early in the session sentiment In the corn
: pit was decidedly weak, but the market closed
strong and near the high point. September
opened unchanged at 4S%c, sold between 4Sc

Having failed to agree when mar
ried, it is not startling that Tahoe D.
Wright and Chester F. Wright, who
were divorced March 25, cannot agree
now. It is because of their non-agree
ment as to a division of community
property that she yesterday sued in
the Superior Court to get her share.
Divorces were granted yesterday by
Judge Murasky to Etta Gray from
Henry H. Gray, on the ground of deser
tion; by Judge ; Sloss to Leona F.
Schulz from George F. Schulz, cruelty;
by Judge Graham to Carrie Keyser
from Klias Keyser, willful desertion;
by Judge Kerrigan to Octavie Perro
chetfrom Charles Perrochet, desertion
and neglect; to Edna F. Llnde from
Harry B. Linde, desertion and failure
to provide.
Complaints for divorce were filed by
Edward Walton against Wilhelmina
Walton, desertion: Samuel R. Leon
against Sofie Leon, desertion; Leonie
Weber against Albert Weber, cruelty
(she says he threatened to kill her);
Nellie J. Davidson against William W.
Davidson, failure to provide: Ger
trude M. Sargent against Arthur T.
Sargent, ' desertion. In the Nellie
Davidson case she says they were
married at Petaluma in 1879 and that
he has an Income of from $100 to $300
a month.

1 "Upon subjecting the several beers to
a careful analysis I nnd that the 'Bud
Â¦weiser Beer.' submitted by the Anheu
ser-Busch Brewing Ass'n. St..Louis, U. S.
A., is very similar, in all its character
istics, to the finest and best Pllsener
beers. It is effervescent, clear and
sparkling, has a beautiful creamy foam
and is possessed of a pure, wholesome
taste and an exquisite hop flavor. Its
keeping qualities by far exceed those of
the Pilsener beers, resulting from the
use of the very best materials in brew
ing, and the thorough maturity of the
product. The analysis further shows
that no. acids or other preservatives have
been used in its production, and as a re
sult of my examination I pronounce
'Budweiser* a well -matured bottled beer
of the highest quality."
This acknowledgment, coming as it
does from the recognized headquarters
of the brewing 1 industry of the old world,
must be a great source of gratification
and in a measure a compensation to the
Anheuser-Busch people for their unceas
ing efforts to produce the finest beer that
can be made. â¢ â¢

the following statement sworn to before

AX AMERICAN PRODUCT
BANKRUPT L1VERTMAN.-9. A. "Wood
ruff, a liveryman of Stockton, filed a petition
In the United States court yesterday asking
that he be declared a bankrupt. Ills liabilities
amount to $2159 64. with no assets.
Lizzie Flammera, a young Italian
woman, stood upon~the porch-balcony
of 210% Washington street and scream
ed for aid while Guinardo Transachi,
swart and sturdy, tore her shirt waist
to ribbons in efforts to pull her into
the house. Patrolman Van Kuren heard
Lizzie's cries and arrested bath her
and Guinardo for disturbing the peace.
Lizzie wore a blue silken veil as she
testified before Judge Mogan and when
she removed this, at his Honor's re
quest, a swollen and blackened right
eye was disclosed. The bruise was in
flicted by the fist of Guinardo, she
said, the only provocation fur the blow
being her refusal to comply with his
demand that she leave her face un
powdered when she started to walk
abroad. She had never applied much
facial decoration, she averred, and
would have used none at all if her nose
were not particularly susceptible to
sunburn, which made it red and shiny.
Guinardo told a different tale. Be
fore going- out of the house, he de
clared, Lizzie powdered her entire vis
age until it looked as if she had taken
a header into a barrel of flour, and
when he protested she scoffed at him.
In his endeavor to restrain her from
venturing abroad with such a com
plexion he might have blackened her
eye, but the damage was not inflicted
maliciously.
The Judge had fairly started to de
liver a homily upon the beauties of
conjugal felicity, when Guinardo
startled the attorneys' table and shock
ed Bailiff Hickey by remarking that
Lizzie was not a wife.
"If that is the case," said his Honor,
"you must either marry the woman or
go to Jail for assaulting her. I'll give
you till to-morrow to think it over and
would strongly suggest that you accept
the hymeneal alternative."
Guinardo promised right there and
then to lead Lizzie to the altar as soon
as the necessary legal preliminaries
could be arranged and the Judge as
sured him that the Mogan matrimonial
bureau would be open for business at
high noon to-day.

Judge Fritz heard some teslmony in
the case of Dr. E. Schmoll, accused of
practicing medicine without a license,
and will hear more of it to-day. The
defendant said his failure to procure
a license was due to the fact that since
his arrival in California the State
Board of Medical Examiners has not
foregathered to do business. He also
hinted that Dr. Dudley Tait, president
of the board, had said something to him
which he had interpreted to mean that
by paying 520 he could obtain immun
ity from prosecution. Dr. Tait ac
knowledged that the sum of 520 had
been mentioned by him In a conversa
tion with the defendant, but he had
alluded to It as bail, not as bribery.
Dr. Cheney and Dr. Gibbon declared
Dr. Schmoll eminently fitted by educa
tion and experience to practice medi
cine in California or anywhere else,
and added that they regarded him as
the world's most reliable authority on
gout. Deputy Health Officer Louis
Levy, Nurse Carrie Newman of the
City and County Hospital and Drs.
Zumwalt and Thorn agreed that aa
the defendant was without a license to
practice in California he was legally
incompetent to practice in California,
despite his professional reputation and
ability
David Keating was in Judge Con
lan's court on the charge of battery,
and as Bailiff Laws was removing him
from the cage to the dock he suddenly
grasped that sturdy officer around the
body, pinning his arms to his sides, and
attempted to throw him over the rail.
It is doubtful that he could have ac
complished the task even If several
policemen had not instantly rushed to
Laws' rescue. The man was so ap
parently demented that the Judge or
dered his removal and examination by
the lunacy commissioners.
"Dr." Samuel Walts, the colored! chir
opodist, who was charged with obtain
ing $10 by false pretense from Letizla
Belzier, a French governess, was found
guilty by Judge Mogan and ordered to
appear to-day for sentence.
The defendant did not deny obtain
ing the money by representing to the
woman that ho had a "cinch" on a
horse race, but he did deny having will
fully defrauded her. " 'Twuz a race at
Petaluma, yo* honnah." the "doctor"
explained, "an* William Beef, a coi
lahed gemman, tole me dat his hoss,
Crescela, a long shot in de bettin",
would win it nan' runnin'. Dat's wot I
tole dat yah gal, an' dat's how she kim
ter gimme de money ter Invest.
'T'wahnt my fault dat Crescela didn't
win, or eben show."
"What about the -statement of Mrs.
Cook of San Rafael, who also accuses
you of having obtained money by false
ly representing that you had a 'dead
sure thing?' " inquired the Judge.
"De lady am mistakenâ dat wuz a
case ob chiropody," was the answer.
B. Vanhuzen lost his Job as teamster
for a lumber firm and was fined $50 by
Judge Conlan as. the result of his cruel
treatment of a horse. Humane Officer
Hooper, who made the arrest, testified
that while riding on a Twenty-second
street car he saw Vanhuzen flrBt kick
the horse brutally and then belabor It
with a thick scantling, while the animal
was vainly trying to move a heavy

Judge Mogan haa the case of Teresa
Devencenzl, a middle-aged matron,
charged with having assaulted 16-year
old Pearl Vlsker last Sunday at Val
lejo and Pearl streets. Pearl and a
young daughter of the defendant had a
fight, in which the latter got the worst
of the exchange, and then the mother
struck Pearl on the face, knocking her
down, and kicked her and hammered
"her head against a lampost. The case
has gone over for a week, as the com
plainant's injuries prevent her appear

A charge of drunkenness against R.
M. Speakman, a poolroom attadhe. was
dismissed after he had called Judge Mo
gan's attention to the bruised condition
of one of his eyes and told how the
damage was inflicted. He is the hus
band of "Anne Speakman, who is under
$500 bail to answer for assault with a
deadly weapon upon Mrs. Clara L#e
fevre about a month ago in the home of
Mrs. Speakman's father. Adolph Beth.
The women fought a duel, Mrs. Speak
man's weapon being a carving knife,
Mrs. Lefevre's a pair of scissors. The
cause of the quarrel was Mrs. Speak
man's objection to her father marrying
Mrs. Lefevre, who was h!s housekeeper.
Speakman told Judge Mogan yesterday
that his eye was blackened by Beth,
who was angry because the Speakmans
would not consent to a settlement of
the case out of court. Mrs. Speakman's
case will be called to-morrow morning.

yesterday returned a verdict for the
plaintiff for $1500 and 7 per cent in
terest, the full amount sued for. Mil
ler sued to recover $1500 on a fire
policy for property burned. The com
pany resisted payment on the ground
that the policy provided that he
should take not more than $1500 con
current insurance in another com
pany, whereas he took $2000. Miller

Oakland, but just as the steamer left
the slip Dingman was atacked with a
severe hemorrhage. Realizing that
the man was in a serious condition,
Captain Leale had the engines re
versed and the dying man hurried to
the Harbor Hospital, but he was dead
before the hospital was reached.
Dingman was a member of the Ma

somewhere in the city. The Masonic
Relief Society was notified and will
take charge of the remains.

Just before adjournment Herman Ep
pinger was placed on the stand, but
taking the cue from the attorneys for
his brother he declined to answer any
questions. He would not admit, that he
was president of the Pacific Coast
Warehouse Company, nor would he tell
whether or no he knew of the present
location of the books of that concern.
The case goes on to-day.
The witness further testified that he
had been offered the $100 check, but was
never Informed what work would be
required of him to earn the $100 a
month. He also said he had been
threatened with Arrest for conspiracy
and told he had better give up the
book.
While the witness could give no defi
nite figures regarding conditions in the
warehouse without referring to the
book, which he lost in his own house,
he was certain that at the time of the
failure there was not as much grain
there as the papers called for.
"By Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa
County in the office' of Attorney Camp
bell," the witness replied, "I was of
fered $100 for the book and a salary of
$100 a month while the case was going
on."
Attorney Ach, cross-examining the
witness, asked: "Have you ever been
offered any money for that book, by
Â¦whom, how much and In whose pres
ence?"
ALLEGED OFFER OF CASn.
Attorney Campbell then pointedly
asked the witness: "Did you not, in my
office, tell me that you had a book in
your pocket which would show what
grain was in the warehouse?"
" The question was objected to, the ob
jection sustained and the defense then
took its turn. '
The witness next told of the nature
of the books kept at the Crockett ware
house and of their disposition. He
swore that with Edwin Freund he had
prepared the books for shipment from
the warehouse.
"Under whose direction was this
done?"
"That of Eppinger & Co."
"Who of the firm gave you the direc
tion?"
"I am not sure; I think it was
Josua Eppinger."
"Was the failure of the flrrn spoken
of to you at that time?"
"I was told that the firm was going
out of business and that the books
should be shipped to. San Francisco."
At this point the memory of the wit
ness seemed to fail him. He knew that
a number of books had been packed,
but could not tell Just what books were
shipped and what were left at the
warehouse. According to hl3 statement
the books were taken up indiscrim
inately, although by some freak of
chance the verv ones wanted by the
prosecution were among those shipped.
His instructions regarding the destina
tion of the books were equally indefi
nite, he testified, saying:
"I was told to ship the books to San
Francisco, but received no address, so I
sent them to my father's house. Later
I met Josua Eppinger on the street
and told him where. the books were. On
the Monday or Tuesday following the
failure they were taken away by a
teamster, accompanied by Josua Ep
pinger."
Regarding the manner in which the
packages were shipped, the witness
said they had simply been addressed,
"E. & Co.. S. F.," and the marking
had been done by the bookkeeper.
The next question was the beginning
of a series, the answers to which
showed that the witness has either a
very poor or a very convenient mem
ory. Interrogated regarding the rec
ords kept of grain going In and out
of the warehouse, he said that as su
perintendent he had kept a memoran
dum book showing the amounts on
hand at various times. This book he
loft in his house, but had forgotten
where he put it.
"Who told you to forget?" asked Dis
trict Attorney Byington.
The question was objected to as im
proper and ruled out.
ORDER OP SHIPMENT.
The sensation of the day occurred j
when, on cross-examination, the wit- !
ness declared that he had been offered
money in Attorney Campbell's office
for the book containing the records of
the receipts and shipments of grain in
the warehouse. \
The greater portion of' the morning
session was taken up in arguments re
garding the admissibility of secondary I
evidence. The former bookkeepers at !
the Crockett warehouse and in the local I
office were placed on the stand and
questioned regarding the methods of
handling grain. After this Deming was
called as a'witness for the prosecution.
In answer to an interrogation as to
who had employed him Deming said he j
did not know, and the reading of an j
affidavit by Attorney Campbell, In
which Deming had stated that Jacob
Eppinger had employed him, did not
serve to refresh the memory of the wit
ness.
"Who paid your salary?" was asked.
"Eppinger & Co.," was the response. I
James Deming, formerly superintend
ent for the Pacific Coast Warehouse
Company, gave some sensational testi
mony in the Eppinger case yesterday
afternoon. On cross-examination he
practically, asserted that an attempt
had been made to win him over to the
side of the prosecution by the offer of
$100 in cash and a salary of $100 a
month until the trial was concluded.
In his direct- testimony Deming swore
that for about nine years he had been
superintendent of the Pacific Coast
Warehouse at Crockett, but did not
know who had employed him. He was
satisfied that it was through the firm
ofEppinger & Co., but could not make
any positive statement.* He did know
on June 5 that the firm was about to
suspend, and helped to conceal the
books.

Henry Bonn, an old soldier, was ar
rested on complaint of his wife and
daughter, who alleged threats to kill.
When the case was called in Judge Mo
gan's court there was no appearance
in person for the prosecution, but the
wife sent word that she would like to
have the defendant sent to jail for thir
ty days. His Honor declined to comply
with the long-distance suggestion, and
ordered the two women brought to
court to-day.
Charles Jackson insisted on closing
