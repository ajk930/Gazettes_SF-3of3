ARTIST CRANE
AGAIN MARRIES
"Weds Young Daughter of His
Divorced AYife and Goes
With Her to New York City
EjerltJ Disratch to ThÂ« CalL
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â Friends of
Bruce Crane, artist, to-day heard that
he has married his divorced wife's
â daughter and returned with her to New
York, and that the gold medal for
paintings at the World's Fair was
awarded to him in SL Louis.
The marriage Is the sequel to a re
markable romance. On November 12.
1S04. the mother cf his present wife
obtained a decree of divorce In which
the grirl was named. Now that the
nuLTTiage is announced the mother of
the girl is reported as saying: "I am
glad of the marriage. The only reason
I sought a divorce was to enable Bruce
to wed my daughter. I shall now de
vote myself to the stage, rny chosen
profession."
When the beautiful widow, Annie
Eurchard Brainerd. married Bruce
Crane In 1S56 she had a 13-year-old
daughter. Two years ago Crane's
friends were shocked to hear that he
had suddenly eloped with his step
daughter, and that his wife had begun
proceedings for divorce.
It was long before Mrs. Crane dis
covered where the elopers had gone.
She finally located them in South Da
kota. Supreme Court Justice Scott
denied her a decree on the ground of
collusion. Baffled in this State, Mrs.
Crane then went to South Dakota and
there renewed her proceedings for a
divorce, which resulted in a decree in
her favor a month ago.

CHICAGO, Dec. 23. â The United

defied the general statutes by issuing a
circular to its constituent companies
to-day, advising them in effect to ig
nore the ruling of the Interstate Com
merce Commission that rate 'divisions
with industrial roads are illegal. The
tremendous tonnage controlled by this
gigantic corporation, the largest* ton
nage in the world controlled by a sin

those railroads which honestly try to
obey the law as interpreted by the
Commerce Commission.
Only one Western line, the Wiscon
sin Central, has refused to enter into
an agreement to discontinue the il
legal practice which fell under the
ban of the commission, and that road
has been selected by the steel corpo
ration as the carrier of all the steel
tonnage which possibly can -be routed
over that line, in the hope that the
other railways will be forced to re

THE jury in the
1 "Nan" Patterson
case was discharged
yesterday, being unable
to agree upon a verdict.
Six of the jurors voted
for acquittal. The pris
oner wept bitterly when
the foreman announced
the result of their delib
erations and is now on
the verge of a break
down. Her counsel will
make an effort to secure
her release on bonds if
the prosecution decides
to again place her on trial
for the alleged murder
of Bookmaker Young.
NEW YORK. Dec 23.â Following a
day of Intense nervous strain. Naa
Patterson to-night Is in the Tombs, ill
and perhaps on the verge of a break
down, but with constant attendance.
The former show-girl, expecting ac
quittal at the hands of the Jury, which
has listened to the evidence In her trial
for tne murder of Caesar Young last
June, went into the courtroom at noon
to learn that the twelve men chosen
to decide as to her innocence or guilt
had been unable to reach an agree
ment; in fact, had divided evenly over
the question as to whether or not she
held the revolver which ended Young's
life.
The Jury stood six to sixâ half for ac
quittal, the other half for conviction.
Although no official announcement was
made farther than this, * courthouse
talk had it that of the six deciding
against Miss Patterson none was for
conviction â  of murder. in, the^ first de
Â»jee;.1hat. one^beldrout.for-i^urdir la
the T second degree, two for manslaugh
ter In the first decree and three for
manslaughter in the second- degree.
Immediately the announcement of
the verdict was made Miss Patterson
broke into a fit of weeping which con
tinued even after she was led from thÂ«
courtroom to a retiring chamber,
where physicians were called and res
toratives administered.
Then she was taken to the Tombs,
but she again wept and moaned and
became hysterical. The efforts of her
father, the prison matron and atten
dants to quiet her were futile.
SYMPATHY FOR PRISONER.
The demonstration In the courtroom
after the announcement of the dis
agreement was somewhat remarkable,
many pressing forward to express sym
pathy for the young woman.
Abraham Levy, chief counsel for Miss
Patterson, called on his client in the
Tombs late this afternoon and remained
with her an hour. He was ill in bed
when the court convened, but when he
learned of the action of the Jury ha
went to the 'jail to cheer his client.
"The girl is in a very bad mental
condition." he said, after he left her.
"She Is almost constantly hysterical.
but I don't think she will collapse. I
hope I left her in a somewhat better
frame of mind. I. of course, cannot tell
what we will do- for her yet. The coun
sel for the defense will have a consulta
tion and will then do the best we can
for her. If the trial is not right away,
I am going to make a desperate effort
to get bail for her. I will plead with
Mr. Jerome to reduce the bail to $15,000
and I will be able. I think, to arrange
for that amount and thus let her have
her freedom while again waiting the
long nerve-racking ordeal she will
have to face."
Interest to-night centered in District
Attorney Jerome's future action. HÂ«
has not said -.vhat he will do. but it was
intimated that the way the Jury stood
may influence him as to a new trial.
The jury took but one ballot, accord
ing to the foreman, and devoted the re
mainder of the time to- discussion. From
first to last the division was even. For
twenty-four hours the Jurymen dis
cussed the evidence and one juror Is
quoted to-night as saying that one of
those who stood for acquittal tried on
the coat which Young wore at the time
of his death and with a revolver at
tempted to demonstrate that suicids
was possible, j
The interest in the case was so in
tense that the crowds which were out
side the courtroom all the morning
pursued Foreman Harmer of the Jury
when he left the court after the final
adjournment. He boarded a trolley,
but men chased the car to his business
office and mounted police were called
upon to disperse the throng.
EXPECTED AX ACQOTTAIi.
Abraham Levy to-night issued a
statement in the course of which he
said:
"From our understanding of the law
applicable to it, and a careful analysis
of the material proofs which could be
regarded as having weight or logical
relation to the case, we felt confident
that the trial would result in the girl's
acquittal and we are disappointed at
the outcome.
"We are more convinced than ever
that a verdict of guilty will never be
reached in the case. Whether or not
there Is to be a third trial is. a matter
largely resting In the official Judgment

of the District Attorney, vhose conclu- i
Bion on that subject necessarily will be j
affected by his legal judgment as to th-Â» j
probability of conviction and his more j
purely official judgment whether or not j
the county should be subjected to the :
enormous expense which another trial
of *=uch a case entails."
After expressing his appreciation of
the work of Judge Davis, and review
ing thÂ» fact that there was no Coro
ner's inquest and that the defense did
r.ot have the minutes of the Grand
Jury which indicted Miss Patterson,
l^evy continued:
"The defendant is wholly without
means. When counsel assumed, the de
fense of her case it was with the un
derstanding and in the expectation that
the defendant would be sufficiently
equipped with means, if not to properly
compensate them, at least to meet the \
disbursements and actual expenses j
which were bound to arise. This she
has never been able to do, so that dur
ing the progress of the trial we did not
even have the stenographer's minutes
of the testimony, but were obliged to
depend upon our own notes as to proofs
given through a trial spreading over
three weeks. I
DEFENSE WITHOUT FUNDS. j
â¢Probably the most important wit- !
ress for the defense should have been t
Miss Blake, the telephone operator at |
the Pt. Paul Hotel, who received the j
various messages which the deceased
tent on that morning. But we were
entirely without means to secure her
attendance at the trial and only discov- j
ered her whereabouts in St. Louis
vhile thÂ» trial was In progress.
â¢There were many other embarrass
ments from which the defendant suf
fered with regard to the non-appear
ance of witnesses which are well known
to the public.
"We feel confident now that, in
view of the wide publicity given to the
caf^, other witnesses will come for
ward if necessary to corroborate the
defendant's story in all its substantial j
details. We question, however, wheth
er the District Attorney will move for
a third trial of this case."
At 10:S0. tho hour which had been
Bet for the opening of court, _ word
came by telephone that Justice Davis
â¢was delayed and that he would not
reach the courthouse until 11:30. In
the meantime the police stationed
about the courthouse corridors had
tcrious difficulty in holding In check
the crowds clamoring for admission.
The court's order that spectators be
rigidly excluded from the courtroom
was carried out almost to the letter.
Half a hundred persons occupied seats
In the courtroom. Among them were
three women. Promptly at 11:30
John Randolph Patterson, the pris
oner's father, came in and took a seal
et the counsel's table.
.' FATHER SHOWS THE STRAIN.
Xo word had been received from
Justice Davis to that time, however,
and there followed another wait of
ten minutes before a stir indicated
that the court was about to resume its
6ession. A moment later the Jurors,
their faces showing deep lines as a re
sult of their all-night vigil, filed sol
emnly in and took their places behind
the rail. Miss Patterson had not
reached the courtroom up to that
time, but as the jurors marched down
the aisle her father, half turning in
his chair, gazed- intently upon their
laces. As he turned back and fum
bled nervously a paper which lay
upon the table his hands shook as if
â¢with palsy and it seemed apparent
that he saw little to arouse hope in
the faces of the jurors. 'A moment
later Nan Patterson, gowned entirely
in black and with a heavy veil con
cealing her features, walked with a
firm, strong step to the chair beside :
her father. As she sat down sh'e j
placed one arm across her father's
shoulder. With the otherwshe raised
her veil and kissed the old man In a
very pretty, affectionate way. Of the
two the father showed in a far great
er degree the strain under which they
had been for many hours and. for a
time the girl turned comforter. There
was scarcely a moment's delay when j

mas with her mother, and the disagree
ment was a most poignant disappoint
ment to h<?r. The old man tried to com
fort her, but she fell fainting in his
arms.
The girl was revived from her faint
ing spell, but continued to sob hyster
ically. Justice riavis thanked the jury
and remanded Miss Patterson to the
Tombs. She was Jed out sobbing vio
lently and in a state of severe nervous
collapse.
After the rest of the jury had left the
courtroom the foreman remained and
had a consultation with Justice Davis.
The foreman said that only one ballot
was taken, standing six for acquittal
and six for conviction. It was then
found there was such a vast difference
of opinion that the remainder of the
tim^ was taken up in argument.
DISAPPOINTMENT IS KEEN.
The keenest disappointment was felt
in the courtroom and in the great
crowd outside when the disagreement
was announced. Not since the Moli
neux care has there been so much in
terest taken in a criminal trial in this
city and many of those present had
hoped for a verdict of acquittal. The
closing of the proceedings at this time,
just two days before Christmas, added
to the sentimental interest In the girl's
fate, and the prospect of spending the
holiday in prison undoubtedly accentu
ated the eirVs a^ony when she heard
the words that she was not to be free.
Her father, who has sat by her side
ever since the trial began, and whose
tender caress and devotion to her have
been the most touching feature of the
trial, tried to comfort her, but his sad
dened face and mournful " expression
mbbed the words he uttered of force
and meaning as he said: "Don't worry,
little girl; it will come out all right
yet." "
PRISONER ' \VKEPS BITTERLY.
After her removal from the court
room Miss Patterson was taken to a
retiring; room and restoratives were
given to her. She soon revived, but
whi'e passing over the bridge* of 3ighs
on her way to her cell in the Tombs she
suffered a second fainting spell, from
which she recovered slowly. Once in
her cell. Miss Patterson wept bitterly.
A Tombs missionary tried to comfort
her, but she would not be comforted.
She cried for her father, but when he
was admitted to her cell she did not
immediately recognize him. The father
wept in company with his daughter.
After the prison physician had ad
ministered stimulants Miss Patterson
recovered some of her former self-pos
session.
"Do you think." she asked the mis
sionary, "t.hat the Jury believed me
guilty because I broke down and cried,
along toward the last there. You re
member, after I had stood Mr. Rand's
sttack as long as I could, I Just had to
break down and cry, and I thought
that may be they thought I was that
kind of a woman."
The missionary reassured her and Bhe
became more cheerful.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. â Deep
gloom prevails at the home of Nan
Patterson- Charles H.' Patterson, 18
years old, a brother of the girl, was
the only member of the family who
would see callers to-night. > S
"My mother is still very ill," he
said. "She has hardly slept since the
jury went out yesterday and I was up
with her all night. Her feeling, of
course, is very intense, and her dis
appointment at the failure of the jury
to agree when she confidently ex
pected an acquittal is very bitter and
very hard to bear.
"As the jury was kept out so long
we all hoped for a final verdict of not
guilty and thought Nan would be here
to spend Christmas with us. Of course
the intimation that the case may never
come to trial again is some consola
tion."
Mrs. Patterson is more than 60
years old and during the strain of the
trial has been In very feeble health.

History of the "Xan" Patterson
Murder Case.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23. â The crime
with which Nan Patterson, the former
showgirl, was charged in the trial
: that ended to-day in a disagreement of
! th*Â» jury was one of the most sensa
| Ikmal in New York criminal an
j nals. Its peculiar circumstances, the
prominence of Caesar Young iri sport
ling- circles and the glamour, .thrown
j around the central figure in the case
j because of her membership in one of
i the famous "Florodora"' companies, all
â¢ tended to lend it an interest hardly
j rivaled in recent years. From that
I world vaguely defined as "sporting,"
the interest in "the murder in the han
som cab" spread through all circles and
! the proceedings of the trial have bean
J read from coast to coast and have held
j a place on the first page of the metro
i politan press.
With Miss Patterson sitting beside
him in a cab, Caesar BToung was an his
way to a steamer pier, where his wife
awaited him to sail with. her for Eu-
I rope. The trip avowedly was planned
j to break his relations with the girl. It

Then an old man, Martin Hazelton,

NEW YORK. Dec. j 23.â Charles F.
Dodge, the former husband of the pres
ent wife of Charles W.. Morse, the ice
king, was safely landed in police head
quarters to-night after he had- made an
effort to throw himself from the steam
er vn which he. was brought from Tex
as. Officers of the steamer Latnpasas,
on which Dodge was brought from
Texas, say : that en route when they
pretended to be off guard, without an
instant' Â«3 warning, Dodge made a rush
for the guard rail and was just about
to spring over when they grabbed him
and got him back into his room. He
screamed that he wanted to end his
life and that they would never get him
back to New York alive.
It is reported that Dodge has made a
complete confession of the inside facts
of the famous Dodge-Morse case, in
volving prominent New Yorkers in a
double case of conspiracy and black
mall.
For five hours Dodge was closeted
in the private office of Commissioner
McAdoo with the United States Mar
shals and Assistant District Attorney
Garvan. while Bartow S. Weeks, his
attorney, stormed at the door and der
manded admittance to the room
where Dodge was undergoing the
third degree.
The District Attorney has been after
Dodge for more than a year and has
spent m^re than $17,000 in the pur
suit.
Dodge married Miss Clemence
Cowles in San Francisco in 1ST". In
1889 she separated from him, and in
1898 secured a divorce. She married
the ice king, C. W. Morse, in 1901. In
1903 Justice Scott set aside the decree
of divorce from Dodge because he was
not served with the papers, and her
marriage to Morse was annulled. She
again sued Dodge for divorce. A let
ter was then discovered in which
Dodge admitted he had been legally
served with the notice in her first pro
ceedings. Dodge was indicted for per
jury. The court thereupon reinstated
the original divorce and she again be
came Mrs. Morse.

This, in brief, is the story of the

of Escape of Torpedo-Boats.. ;
MUKDEN. Dec. 23.â The "Russians
succeeded to-day in advancing the po
sition of their siege guns four, miles
south along the wagon road. This was
accomplished in the face of a pretty
heavy artillery fire from the Japanese,,
who fired upward of a hundred -shells,
which, however, did little execution;
only two men" being wounded. '
On account of the difficulties. in get
ting supplies here many Chinese and
other refugees have been sent north
by the Chinese officials.
Volunteers on the night of December
21 occupied Japanese trenches opposite
their positions. Three trenches were
evacuated by - the Japanase with
scarcely a fight. The victors were sur
prised to find a box lying in plain view,
which they opened carefully, fearing
that it might contain explosives, but
they found in it wine, biscuits and
sweets, and a letter in Russian politely
requesting its acceptance "from' dis
turbing neighbors."
RUSSIANS ARE SENTIMENTAIj.
Correspondent Describes the Burial of
Cossacks Killed Below Sindee.
MUKDEN, Nov. 25.â Wild and rough
as are the Cossacks, they are peculiar
ly sentimental and as susceptible as
children to the emotion of the hour,
â¢.vhether it be anger or sympathy. One
of the most striking sights I have ever
witnessed was the whole of Mist
chenko'3 division paying Its respects to
the remains of the four Cossacks who
were killed and mutilated below Sin
dee. It was some time back,: just
toward the end of the summer. "The
burial was fixed for 9 a. m. Mistchenko
and all his staff and the Fourth Chita
Regiment, to which the men belonged,
was accorded the place of prom
inence in the v ceremonles. There were
no coffin's available, and the bodies
were wrapped in plaited straw, but so
smothered with wild flowers and native
grasses that It was impossible to see
the ghastly blood stains' soaking
through the covering until the corpses
were lifted from the stretchers to be
placed in the grave. The churchly ac
cessories were scanty. An old table
had been brought from a deserted Chi
nese hut, and on it was placed an old
regimental ikon and before it a single
bit of wax candleâ the nearest ap
proach to a taper that could be had.
The priest of the Barnaulski Regiment
officiated. He took his place before the
table;- the order "Hats oft; pray," was
passed down the line, and Mistchenko,
setting the example, uncovered and
bowed his head, while tJie men knelt,
bareheaded, but each with his carbine
between his knees. The church ac
cessories may have been poor and
simple, but the temple was magnificent.
It was Ood's own house, a walled-in
valley with green hills rising on every
side and over all rising a single peak
that might have been the spire of this
mighty cathedral.
The service, simple but affecting,
was soon over. The priest blessed the
bodies and the stretchers were raised'
shoulder-high and passed up the hill
past the massed regiments, and the
band played a dead march. Mist
chenko and his staff followed on foot,
like the rest, ' and after the Cossacks
had placed the bodies in the open grave

DOGGER BANK INCIDENT.
Russians Say They Will Prove Pres

PARIS, Dec. 23.â There will not be
the slightest hesitancy on the part of
the Russian witnesses in the Hull in
quiry to declare dogmatically that
they met Japanese torpedo-boats on
Dogger Bank. Captain Cladd's testi
mony., which will carry great weight
on account of his well-known honesty,
cool headedness and judgment, will
be supplemented by that of other offi
cers present on the fatal night off
Hull.
Three officers detached from Ad
miral Rojestvensky's fleet on special
missions to the Czar, have just arrived
in this city and will lay before the
commission what they consider strong
evidence of the presence of Japanese
in the channel.
Lieutenant Valrond, who was in
charge of the torpedo operations on
the Kamchatka, says he will bring
flashlight photographs taken duirng
the night of the Hull Incident which
will clearly prove the presence of the
Japanese vessels. If they were, not
Japanese, then what was the nation
ality of the vessels, . Is the question.
Valrond said to-day: "They cer
tainly were not Russian, because they
were of different color from our boats.
Moreover, I will show wireless tele
graph ribbons containing correspond
ence between our. vessels that night on
the subject of the strange torpedo
boats that were following us.' What
became of the vessels it is not our
business to explain, but personally I
am willing: to stak<s my life that I saw
them." Valrond speaks of other evi
dence still more important, but re
serves it for the Czar and the commis

SHARP NOTICE
Venezuelan President Must
Improve His Manners if He
Wants to Avoid Trouble
KOOSEVELT IS ANGERED
Ruler of Little Republic Is
. Given Sixty .Days' Grace
to Change His Attitude
Special Dlfpatch to The Call
Dec. 23.â President
Roosevelt has . determined to teach
President Castro of Venezuela a lesson
in good ' government. Roosevelt is
weary of the' long delay of the Ven
ezuelan courts in deciding the asphalt
controversy, angry over the expulsion
from the country of A. F. Jaurett, an
American editor at- Caracas, and in
dignant over the efforts being made by
Castro t6 evade the terms of payment
of the foreign debt provided for in the
peace protocols signed in Washington
by Minister Bowen, acting as the Ven
ezuelan peace envoy, and the British,
German and Italian Embassadors.
v^ Castro will be given sixty days in
which to mend his ways. ''If at the end
of that period of grace he shall not
have assumed an attitude which the
President considers fair and just to
this tcountry and the foreign powers,
a fleet of American warships will be
sent to -Venezuela to make a demon
stration.. If this -be not sufficient to
produce the desired reform, several
ports and custom-houses, probably, will
be seized and held until all disputes
have been satisfactorily adjusted and
Castro has .promised to be good. The
President is determined, if a lesson has
to , be .taught, it shall be thorough, and
that the effect shall , be' felt by. all Cen
tral, and South American' governments.
Castro was to-day given a broad hint
of what he rriay^expect when the notice
was served on him; by Minister Bowen
that his 'explanation of the reason for
the : expulsion of Mr. Jaurett is "very
unsatisfactory" to the State Depart
ment. Department officials say the
fact that confirmation of the report
would be welcome intelligence. It is
quite possible that arrangements were
made for the destroyers with the aid of
a collier to flee southward and. Join
the second Pacific squadron^ to which
they would constitute a powerful re
inforcement.

small skirmish to Emperor Nicholas,
says he personally saw a couple of Jap

Frankenberg throw up hi3 hands. The
latter drew a police whistle and blew
It loudly. V '
Then the thug: rapped his victim

Hood's Sarsaparilla
Has won success far beyond the ef-
fect of advertising only.
Its wonderful popularity .is ex-
plained by its unapproachable merit.
Based upon a prescription which
cured people considered incurable,
Hood's Sarsaparilla
Unites the best known vegetable rem-
edies in such a .way as to .have cura-
tive power peculiar to itself.
Its cures of scrofula, eczema, psori-
asis and every kind of humor, as well
as catarrh and rheumatism, prove
Hood s Sarsaparilla
the best blood purifier ever produced
Its cures of dyspepsia.; lo?s of appe-

BreatH of Firs
Tells of Yule-
Tide Joy.
Be merry all, be merry all.
With holly dress the festive hall.
Prepare the eong. the feast, the ball.
To welcome merry Christmas.
So sang the merry "Follies" at the
Green way dance last night, and the
music of their voices wrought good fun
in the ivory halls of the Palace.
When pray, was there a madder,
merrier dance than last night, under
the warming glow of thousands of
ruby lights? yellow lights there were,
too, rtr*Uns the fleam ot the topaz;
great red silken balloons floated in mid
air, upholding poinsettias in their flam
ing beauty; trees of pungent fir stood
at every pillar, while strands of green
siretched wallward from a huge basket
Qf flr in the center, in which gay poin
settias nestled. A chime of silver bells
fell from the branches of the yule tree,
while red bells, great and small, were
suspended from the ceiling in gay ar
ray. A forest of firs concealed the
makers of the music â than which none
better has been heard these many
moons. But Greenway music is ever
thus â music and suppers distinguish
these Greenway "stunts."
What a dazzling array of pretty
maids and stunning matrons! And
blessings on them for their courage,
for short shirts and curly wigs require
pluck. However, no woman Is fairer
than in the picturesque garb of other
days â and this knowledge jolts their
courage a bit. perhaps.
But the men. alas! the men decline to
reveal to a gaping world their personal
charmsâ or the lack of them â which is
distinctly selfish of them, since the wo
men must. Not a tenth of the men
.wore aught than their clawhammers
and provincial trousers. But that
tenth, here's to them! They were .cap
tivating!

T. B. EASTLAND
BETROTHED TO
MISS WAGNER
Like a prairie afire, ran the glad news
through the ballroom last night of an
engagement. And who do you guess,
ye who were not at the dizzy dance?
Pretty Helen Louise^ Wagner! than
.whom no sweeter. maid wound through
the busy throng. And the man,â the
lucky man? Thomas B. Eastland, son
of the late . Joseph G. Eastland, club
man, bon vivant and interesting chap,
whose attentions to the pretty maid
have been matters of comment. But
even the wisest tabbies didn't guess
the true state of things, and here for
once, the maddening "I told you sos"
haven't smallest chance to score.
Miss "Wagner is a girl of strong per
sonality and mental development,
w:hich traits were 'amply demonstrated
wht^i she defined "a society girl" in
such terse pungent terms on the wit
ness stand in the Dolbeer case.
"While attending most of the big
smart set functions. Miss Wagner
rather deprecated the giving up of
much time to social pursuits, prefer
ring the sweet routine of domestic life.
Mr. Eastland is a man of wealth; in
heriting with his brother large inter
ests in Stockton and Oakland
gas companies and in Mill Valley real
estate, these having come to them at
the death of their mother, a few years
ago. The Eastland home at Mill Valley
is one of the show-places of the burg

SEASON NEAR
Manager Leahy of the Tivoli
Will Bring Noted Artists
From the City of Mexico
W. H. Leahy, the managing director
of the Tivoli Theater Companv, has
just returned from a fortnight's trip
to the City of Mexico, after having
closed a'contract ' of great importance
to the music lovers of San Francisco.
The success of Mr. Leahy's vflit means
that the Tivoli will inaugurate a four
weeks' season of grand opera on Mon
day evening, January 9, which will out
rival in extent and musical importance
any of the former season of grand
opera with which the Tivoli's chief "fame
is associated.
j The company that will present these
operas is an, organization of over one
hundred people imported â  by the Mexi
can Government directly from Italy. It
has been giving a season of grand
opera in the City of Mexico under a
liberal subsidy from the Mexican treas
ury. It was the original intention of
the directors of this organization to go
straight to Havana after the conclu
sion of their engagement in the Mexi
can capital; but through Mr. Leahy's
efforts and his tempting financial in
ducements their tour was rearranged.
In< every department this company is
completely equipped and ,the full list
of principals is as follows: Soprani â
Signora Tettarazzini, Signora Berlindi,
Signora Flory and Signora Bettini;
Mezzo soprani and contralto â Signora
Claessens and Signora Marchi; tenorsâ
Signor Colli, Signor Baselli, Slgnor
Frosini and Signor de Marcho; bary
tones â Signor La Puma, Slgnor Rom
boli and Signor Rossi; bassi â Signor
Rcssi, Signer Mugnoz and Signor Cervi;
conductorsâ Signor Pollacco, Signor
Golisciani and Signor. Longo; stage di
rectorâSignor Saporelli.
There is a superb chorus composed of
fresh-faced, young and talented Italian
signors and signoras.and an orchestra
which, when increased by the addition
of some Specially engaged players of
the Tivoli orchestra, will number fifty.
The total force of artists, chorus, or
chestra and others engaged in the pro
duction will be 325.
The complete repertoire to be pre
sented during the engagement will in
clude: "Faust." by Gounod; "The
Pearl Fishers," by Bizet; "MIgnon," by
Ambroise Thomas; "Manon Lescaut,"
by Jules Massenet; "Lakme," by De
libes; "Rigoletto," by Verdi; "Son
nambula,", by Bellini; "La Traviata,"
by Verdi: "Dinorah," "Pagliacci," by
Leoncavallo; "Cavalleria Rusticana,"
by Pietro Maseagnt; "Lucia," by Don
izetti; "Puritan 1," by Bellini: "The
Barber of Seville." by Rossini; "La
Tosca," by Puccini; "Adrienne Lecouy
rier," by Cilea; "Fedora," by Gior
dani; "Andre Chenier," by Giordanl.
and "Zaza," by Leoncavallo. Many of
the artists who will appear in these
operas have created In Italy the roles
in which they will appear. They have
sung them at La Scala in Milan, the
San Carlo Theater in Naples, the Con
stanzi Theater in Rome, the Paglion in
Florence and the Mosimo in Palermo.

and postmaster, at Arthur, Mendocino
County, was arrested - yesterday! 'on
complaint of Postoffice Inspector Den
nis Coyne on a charge of not-, having
Government; money on r , hand when
called upon to produce it. It appears
that ~-\ Heckdendorf , had. been in the

LIBRARY SITE
NOT SELECTED
Supervisors Unable to De
cide Between Western Ad
dition Blocks 67 and 73
DISCUSS CMC CENTER
Agree to Take Action at a
Meeting to Be Held on
Next Tuesday Afternoon
The SuDervisora' Joint Finance and
Utilities Committee yesterday con
sidered the selection for. a public li
brary site of block 67 of the Western
Addition, bounded by Van Ness avenue.
Grove, Polk and Fulton streets or West
ern Addition block 73, bounded by Van
Ness avenue, Hayes, Fell and Franklin
streets, latter block being recom
mended by the Public Library Trustees.
The committee was unable to arrive at
a decision. 1\V
Thomas Magee & Sons submitted a
statement showing that block 73 was
valued at $659,000 but said it could be
purchased for $^47,000, as they thought
the owners of three-quarters of the
block, for whom the firm was the agent,
would j reduce their prices to that ex
tent.
R. G. Hooker offered to sell a portion
of block 67, being the entire Van Ness
avenue frontage with a depth of 109
feet and adjoining the 75 feet on Grove
and also adjoining the 137% feet on Ful
ton, for the sum of $335,000.
Supervisor D'Ancona contended that
it would be unwise to select a location
for an isolated public building and
thought it better to await architect D.
H. Burnham's return In February,
when some definite plans would be for
mulated for a civic center and for the
proposed extension of the park pan
handle.
Library Trustee O'Connor objected to
any delay In view of the fact that the
library's quarters were inadequate to
accommodate the patrons. He repeated
that block 73 was still the choice of
the trustees. Trustees Edward R. Tay
lor argued that the block was prefer
able . to No. 67 because of its nearness
to Market street: that the building
would face to the east on Van Ness
avenue and would have a permanent
improvement in the church on its
south side. |
"We need a library building sorely,"
said Taylor, "and the present place is
a discredit to the city. The selection
of the site should not be. delayed, for
even if you go ahead now it will be a
long while before we get the library-"
Supervisor Payot said he favored
postponement until Burnham's return;
if a selection was to be made at once
he would vote for block 73.
B. J. Cahill described his plan for
creating a civic center and connecting
it with the park panhandle by a boule
vard on Fulton street and a chain of
parks. Louis Zeh objected to cutting
away sixty feet of property on each
side of Fulton street.
Supervisor Braunhart said he would
not favor submitting the propositions
for a bonded indebtedness for a civic
center to the people until th*e acquisi
tion of a municipal water supply was
voted upon. . Connor spoke in favor
of .block 73 as recommended by " the
Library Trustees.
The committee decided to postpone
action until next Tuesday at 2 p. m.

PRINCESS MAY
FORFEIT COIN
Breaks Agreement on Which
Allowance Was Granted by
Making Trip to Dresden
REMAINS IN LEIPZIG
Circumstances of Her Leav
ing Court Now Said to
Have Been 3Iisrepresented
DRESDEN, Dec. 23. â Countess Mon
tigiiuso. formerly the Crown Princess
Louise of Saxony, the divorced wife of
King Frederick Augustus, by coming
to Dresden and trying to see her chil
dren yesterday has probably forfeited
her allowance of $7500, which was
granted her on the condition that she
would not sot fcot on German soil. This
condition, however, may not be en
forced, as popular sentiment in favor
of the Princess is so strong already
that the court w ill avoid anything that
will give the impression of punishing
her for her natural womanly feelings.
The version of the Countess" misad
venture commonly believed in the
kingdom of Saxony is that she is
guilttass of actual wrongdoing, and is
the victim of an intrijue of the Center
party, which is described as using un
scrupulous means to prevent a strong
Liberal from becoming Queen. The
circumstances of the Countess leaving
the court are so overlaid with fiction
that the truth probably will be un
known to the present generation of
Saxons. .
LEIPZIG, Saxony, Dec. 23. â Count
<Â»ss Montignoso (former Crown Prin
cess Louise) Is still here. Inquiries at
rhe villa of Dr. Zehme, her counsel,
brought an answer from the attorney's
wife that the Countess was not yet in
a condition to travel, the mental ex
citement of the last few days having
told severely upon her physical
Ftrength.
It seems that the Countess was over
come by a sudden impulse to see her
children and left for Florence without
informing her parents at Salzeburg or
acybody in Saxony.
It is firmly denied here that the
Saxon Government has issued an or
der for the expulsion of the Countess
from Saxony.
Much excitement prevails over an ex
pression which the Countess is said
to have let drop. She is reported to
have said: "I love my Saxon land. I
am wmine back soon."
This utterance supposedly refers to
a conditional promise given by the
King's representative at her hotel here
that she might hope to see her children
after the excitement in the kingdom
had further subsided.
The Dresdener Journal says the
Countess purposed seeing the King as
well as her children and that the
King's representative informed her that
a meeting was impracticable-

necessary expenses and . fixed charges
only. In addition there comes into the
treasury money from other sources
than taxation, by which the- above
amount . is raised $2,000,000. . This
makes a total expenditure of. more
than $15,000,000 in two years, and is
considered an extravagant total for a
State of California's population. In
these amounts nothing is Included for
new buildings and. repairs to old ones,

If appropriations are kept within! the
limit of his estimates the tax rate will
be for each of, the next two years $0,439,
exclusive of 2 cents for the State Uni
versity. He has included In his esti
mate the cost of ' the new courts to be
about $200,000 for two years. There re
mains to be paid $50,000 in each year
for the Big Basin purchase. The needs
of the' State hospitals he has included

Both prisons require larger appropria

FIGHTING FOE SEATS
La wyer Contends That the
Watchers Are Responsible
for the Election ' Frauds
" DENVER, Dec. 23.â According to a
report published in the Times to-day, it
has beenjleflnitely decided by the Re
publican leaders to contest the election
of Alva Adams as Governor before the
Legislature by which the vote is can
vassed. Their purpose, it is said, is to
submit evidence of frauds committed
in ninety-nine Denver Democratic pre
cincts over which the Supreme Court
took jurisdiction and ask to have the
entire vote of all these precincts reject
ed in accordance with the example of
the court which threw out the votes of
five precincts where it Was. shown by
the evidence in contempt cases that its
injunction had been , violated. â¢
In defending Clarence P. Dixon, the
election clerk, charged with contempt
in having permitted illegal voting at
the November election in violation of
the Supreme Court's injunction, Attor
ney Philip Hornbein declared in open
court to-day that the ballot box must
have been tampered with since the
election. The expert's report had shown
that there were eighty-one ballots in
the box which were folded in such a
manner as to show that they were not
deposited in the usual manner through
the opening in the 'box.
"It is impossible," said Hornbein,
"that any election . officer put the
eighty-one folded ballots in that box.
The Supreme Court watchers were
there the entire day; they stayed until
the morning after election, ! when the
box was taken to the courthouse; they
did not allege that any stuffing of the
box had been done, and the only theory
I have for the presence of those eighty
one ballots in the box is that they were
put there by some persons not connect
ed with the Democratic organization."
He intimated that the watchers had
been bribed.
When the case of W. H. Hunter, who
is accused of contempt in Precinct*
Ten, Ward Three, was called this aft
ernoon, he failed to respond. His
bondsmen were given until January 3
to produce him. No ' more contempt
cases will be tried until after the holi
days.
The State y Board of Canvassers spent
the entire day in hearing, arguments in
regard to its authority to go behind the
returns presented by the county can
vassing boards. â  The board, which is
composed of five State officers, all of
whom are Republicans, has been asked
to throw out the vote of certain pre
cincts in Boulder and Las Anirnas
counties on the ground of alleged
frauds and award the certificates of
election to two Republican candidates
for the State Senate. On the returns
Democrats were elected aird the Senate
is a tie, its membership consisting of
seventeen Democrats and seventeen Re
publicans.
Attorney John A. Rush, representing
the Democratic State organization, late
this afternoon made application to the
Supreme Court to set a date when it
would hear arguments on a petition for
a writ of mandamus to compel the
State Canvassing Board to count the
returns as made by the County Clerk of
Las Animas County â¢ on the vote for
Senator. The court compiled with the
request and named Tuesday next as the
date.
While the board does not concede to
any court the power to direct it in its
duties of canvassing election returns,
the inference was given that nothing
would be done In the Senatorial con
tests until the Supreme Court had dis
posed of the petition for a mandamus
writ. ,~
The action of Attorney Rush to-day
will bring before the Supreme Court
the question of the power of the Can
vassing Board to'go behind the returns.

Columbia Faculty Passes
the Gould Case Back to
Undergraduates for Action
NEW AGREEMENT MADE
Kules Drawn Up Which the
College Boys Promise to
Enforce in the Future
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â A truce has
been arranged between the faculty of
Columbia University and the sopho
more class, which resented the sus
pension of four" of its number for par
ticipation in the Kingdon Gould hazing
affair and which had tnreatened to
quit thel university in a body.
The student -. board, Represented by
the presidents of the various classes,
both college and science, met Dean
Hutton to-day to discuss the suspen
sion of the four- sophomores. Their
decision - was that the suspension will
be left primarily in the hands of thÂ«
student board. ' '
The conditions under which this was
arranged are: 1. The student board
will prohibit having in all obnoxious
forms. 2. Freshmen will be -under the
surveillance of the sophomores. 3- Any
case of "freshness" of the underclass
men will be brought to the attention
or the board and it will serve notice
on the student that his actions have
aroused the animosity of the sopho
mores and It will fix a penalty which
he must pay., 4. There will be, an un
derclass fight and the winners will have
ihe right to summon the officers' of the
defeated class to appear at their din
ner. \
This is expected to do away with, the
capturing of freshmen by the second
year men.
A formal statement issued to-day by
President Nicholas Murray Butler, an
nouncing the suspensions, dealt at
length with the enforcement of college
discipline at Columbia. In this con
nection the statement said:
The university will not permit 'to paÂ«s nn
noticed any annoyance of an individual student
or any attack upon him by a committee or
group of other students, whether this goes by
the name of hazing or otherwise. Thefe is no
elaborate code of rules at Columbia, the vio
lation of any one of which will subject the
offender to academic discipline. Every, student
is treated as a gentleman and is expected to
conduct himself as a gentleman. Whenever a
case has been reported which Involved the per.
secution of any individual freshman by a group
of sophomores who could be Identified academic
discipline hao followed and will follow with
Increasing severity until the practice is
stopped. . ,

ifornia for the guidance of all persons
who may be persuaded to take interest
in the mineral resources of this State.
It is of large size, on cloth and of a
sufficient 'scale to be understood and
to be generally useful. ."
Succeeding and supplementary to a
long series of mining .bulletins and
county registers that have been Is
sued from the State Mining Bureau
the mineral map is more valuable to
mining men than any hitherto exist
ing. The publication is used to an ex
tent to advertise California. On the
map are published the statistics con
cerning the State's mineral output in
1903. The total reaches the respectable
figures of $3),759,040. Of this sum the
precious metals claim $16,989,666. All
mineral substances, including gold and
silver, amounted to $20,856,666. The
non-metallic substances were valued at
$2,048,638. The hydrocarbons and gases
amounted in 1 value to $7,945,273, and the
structural materials' to $6,908,463.
To sum up, it appears that the pre
cious metals were .less than one-half
of the whole, and the oil fields and
structural deposits produced ; only $2,
186,020 less than the gold mines.
The new mineral map is remarkable
in. that it shows, at a glance, the ex-.
tensive distribution of mineral and
other deposits. This is accomplished
by the use of a color, scheme and of
distinctive signs, which are placed for
reference. The .claim is made good
that California is mineralized from end
to end and that nearly every counjty
has mineral deposits of size.
Among the revelations relating to
quicksilver, for instance, is the pictor
ially illuminated fact that there are
cinnabar deposits in Del Norte, Siski
you, Shasta, Kings and Santa Barbara
counties, In addition to the counties of
Santa Clara, San Benito, Monterey,
Napa, San Luis Obispo, Sonoma and
other counties where the existence of
quicksilver has been a matter of more
common knowledge- El Dorado County
also has quicksilver.
Copper deposits are marked in green.
These are distributed as plentifully as
gold deposits, scores of counties having
gold. Something new is the designa
tion of the saline deposits of the State
in detail. The'se are remarkably dis
tributed. The four principal substances
are borax, salt, soda and niter. Of
course'" the â¢ regions of ' Death Valley
figures largely in the showing relative
to the salines. Salt deposits are cred
ited also to Hu'mboldt, Siskiyou,. Shasta,
Colusa, Amador, Mono, | Alameda, San
Mateo, Inyo, San Bernardino, San
Diego, San Luis Obispo and Kern coun
ties. , \
WHERE CO Alt IS FOUND.
to the map there are coal
deposits in Riverside, Kern, Fresno,
Alameda, Sonoma, Contra Costa, Men
doclno, Humboldt, Amador and Siski
you counties. No oil fields are cred
ited to the counties nortn of Fresno,
but gas wells appear on the map in
several counties.
In addition to the mineral and relief
maps, which are published together,
there is an accompanying map on
which the States \ot Maine, New York,
Vermont, New Hampshire and Ohife
are tucked away In the area of Cali
fornia and about the edges there is
depicted a large amount of room on the
map of California that these States,
combined, are unable to fill.
' " Considering the wide distribution of
mineral substances in California, which
extend from the most northern to the
mest southern counties, this comparison
of arerts of States other than California
with the size of this State supplies a
great object lesson which intelligent
miners in all parts of the world will
be Quick to see'and to appreciate.
The manner in which a modern camp
is created in California is illustrated
by an article in the Redding Search
light, which says regarding the build
ing plans for Kennett, the new smelter
town:
Th!rty-nve brick bulldlncs in Kennett. That'
is the size of the contract the Holt & GregK
Company of this city has entered into with
Charles Butters of Kennett. .
Of course the projected buildings will not be
put up at once, but they are to be constructed
as fast as masons can throw brick and mortar
together. Work on the first one has already
been commenced. . That is to say, graders ore
at work preparing the ground for ths founda
tion and brick are beginning to arrive from
the Anderson yards.
The thirty-five buildings called . for under
the contract Include twenty-five cottagec, fcur
two-story brick business buildings and the rent
one-8tory. business butldlngB.
The Butters group, of bricks will bÂ« a gocd
starter for. the nÂ»w town. They will set a
good pattern for others to follow and will in
dicate that when the. town is built it will be
built rirht. There will not be the array of
hastily . constructed ramshackle frame bulld
ines that make such easy prey â  for ,the big
fires that are. common in the early history of
tewns that have a. rapid growth. The cyanide
works of the Butters Company, a largo build-
Inf near the depot that has stood vacant for
years. . is now being remodeled and cut into
rooms suitable for hotel purposes.
The construction of a large tunnel
is in progress In Siskiyou County, the
purpose of which is to use in tapping
frcm the Siskiyou side the ore vein
running .parallel with the Dorleska
mine, that is: now operated from the
Trinity County side. The Etna Ad
vance says that the Yellow Rose and
the Dorleska mines are to be operated
through the tunnel, whicn will be 1200
feet long, 1 and that one" hundred men
will tie put to work' in the spring on
the Dorleska.
â¢ According to the Redding Free Press
a new copper mine will be opened at
once' in Shasta" County.'
v The â¢ CoppeV " Crest group * of ~ copper claims,
adjoining the -Mammoth mine ' near Kennett,
where a big 750-ton â  smelter is now being In
stalled. * Is; to be. brought into a state of active
development. ,1. . O. Jlllson \ of. the Gladstone
mine ' at. French Gulch has secured an option
on t a lanre 'â  interest . In the Copper Crest, and
be. â¢ with - M. - ; E.\ Dlttmar, who owns the re
maining interest, will - aj : once begin the work
of openliut;the mine:; and 'developing It. The
Copper jCrest Is but a' short ; distance from thÂ«
main working ground of the Mammoth and
lies directly between that big property anÂ« the
Frlday-Lowdon â  group. , -
BELCHER â¢ IS APPROVED.
The : recent convention' of the â¢ Cali-
fornla Miners' Association is still ac
tively discussed by the press of the
mining counties >of California. The
Placerville Nugget commends â¢ the pa
per that was prepared by E. A. Belcher
relating to the extra lateral rights
problem, and says editorially:
What Is dona cannot be undone, and men
who have acquired mines under the old laws
wiUT of course, have the rights . that thÂ«y
boucht â among which ts the almost sertaia
guaranty of Interminable litigation should
their property prove of value. But future ac
quisitions of mineral land titles and auaxtz
claims ought certainly to bÂ« limited to the,
vertical planes of the surface boundaries car
ried down to the certer of the earth if possible
and desired, but bounded just the same.
Wa are aware that much may be said as
to the natural equities of the discoverer of a
lode In following up his discovery when & well
defined apex Is within his ground, and yet thÂ»
loda takes a sudden departure Into another
man's property lines. But the law Is suffi
ciently generous and, so long as the end lines
shall be parallel. It does not Insist that the
side lines shall be straight or curved or any
thlnr. The requirement Is simple t hit the
claim along the vein shall not exceed 13tO
feet, nor be more than SOO feet on each side
of the vein.
The Kennedy mill in Amador County
is now dropping 100 stamps. The ver
tical shaft is down 2700 feet
An electrical company has acquired
rights on the Stanislaus River, six
miles east of Murphys. Calaveras
County, and proposes to transmit elec
tric power to Sonora and other Tuol
ume points by next July.
The Union Copper Company at Cop
peropolis is preparing to build a
smelter. Forty men are at work in the
company's mine.
The Crystal mine, near Omo, El Do
rado County, will be reopened. The
company operating the Eagle mine, In
the same county, has purchased the
Stillwagon mine.
The old Idaho-Maryland shaft In Ne
vada County has been cleared and re
timbered in view of large operations.
PROGRESS OF TOMBSTONE.
Tombstone, Arizona, which dwindled
to a deserted village some years ago.
Is now a town of 6000 people. The
Tombstone Consolidated Company is
pumping 3,000,000 gallons a day and
sinking steadily. Part of the old
tailings, ' that had been worked over
four times, are now going through the
cyanide process. The Tombstone Con
solidated Company is a fusion of about
all the old time mining companies of
Tombstone. New processes alone have
made it possible to resume operations.
By the settlement of the suit con
cerning the South Bisbee mine the
local stockholders will' receive 5525,000.
During the twelve months ending No
vember 1, 1904, the gold mines of South
Dakota"* produced $7,000,00* in round
figures. Of this more than $4,000,000 is
credited to the Homestake mine alone.
The Tanana- mines railway will be
constructed from I Fairbanks to the
mines on Cleary, Pedro and other gold
creeks.
Four gold dredging companies are
now at work On the Yuba River lands
east of Marysville. These companies
have taken options on large tracts. Six
dredgers will be operating near Da
guerre Point next spring. New camps
mark the scene of activity in this most
recent form of gold mining.
The United States Geological Survey
makes a curious mistake in asserting
that Nevada was the leading State in
the Union in the production of gold
and silver^in the United States in 1903.
The fact is that Nevada was seventh.
Colorado, California, Montana, South
Dakota, Utah and Arizona all led Ne
vada last year on the basis of the re
turns. With the increasing output of
Tonopah and Goldfleld it is probable
that Nevada will be found nearer the
head of the line when the statistics
for 1903 are compiled. No one doubts
that- Nevada has a great future as a
producer of the precious metals.
POLICE OFTEN PRESENT
TO WARN MONNIER JR.
Witnesses of the Department Say De
ceased WMnemaker, Sometimes
Appealed to Them.
A fair representation of all i grades
of the Police Department was present
yesterday in Judge Graham's court
during -the hearing of the Monnier
will contest- . A detective, a patrol
man, one sergeant and a police cap
tain testified as to their efforts to keep
the peace in the Monnier household.
The witnesses were called by George
D. Collins for the proponent to show
the general quarrelsomeness of the
younger Monnier. All , testified that
the father had asked them several
times to speak to his son, but never
actually requested his arrest, al
though it was suggested by the po
licemen.
Mrs. Monnier was on the stand dur
ing the latter part of the day and con
tinued her testimony as to the return
of George Monnier from Europe and
the subsequent quarrels between hus
band and wife, culminating in a suit
for divorce brought by the < young
husband. Mrs. Monnier emphatically
denied that he was in any way the In
stigator of the action. She also de
nied the testimony of witnesses for
the contestant as to who began the
quarreling in the Monnier home..
Henry C. Hacke was placed on the
stand by the defense to tell of the
poisoning of himself and family by pie"
bought at the same bakery that the
Monniers patronized. The poisoning
of both families took place on the
same day. - " â â â 
The defense called'. a great many
witnesses to testify as to the trouble
between father, and son and the quar
rels growing out of card games at the
Monnier home. The witnesses were
E. L.'Head, Joseph- Royla'nce, J. S.
Godeau, Joseph -Dole, Richard Mc-
Coy, Hakon BJorn, Policeman Jamea
A. Feeney. -Sergeant James T. Don

WOULD UTILIZE LAKES
Seeks an Appropriation to
Insure Continuation of
Federal Government Work
The California Water and Forest
Association will ask the Legislature of
California to appropriate $76,000 to
provide for the joint investigation
with the Federal Government of thÂ«Â»
water resources of California and thÂ»
best methods of preserving California
forests. This wag determined upon
definitely at a meeting of the execu
tive committee of the, association at a
meeting held yesterday in this city.
A bill that was prepared by the Unit
ed States reclamation service to pro
vide for the utilization of the waters
of the Little Klamath Lake. Tule or
Rhett Lake, Goose Lake and Modoo
Lake In connection with the Irrigation
and reclamation operations of thÂ«
reclamation service was also approved.
The bill providing for the appropri
ation of $76,000 is drawn to cover thÂ«
work of the Geological Survey In mak
ing: topographic . maps, gauging
streams, determining underground
water supplies and for the conserva
tion of the waters of the State, sur
veying reservoir sites and canal loca
tions and investigating the economic
quality and purity of the water of thÂ«
State; to encourage and co-operate in
the study by the chief, of the Bureau
of Forestry of the Department of Ag
riculture of the forest resources of thÂ»
State and their proper conservation,
and especially with a view of formu
lating a State forestry policy; also to
co-operate with the experiment sta
â¢tiona of the Department of Agricul
ture relative to the best methods of
distributing and using water.
*In the bill it is also provided that
no work shall be done where it will
interfere with the water already ap
propriated or In reservoirs or now in
use for irirgation or domestic pur
poses under the laws of California. It
13 also provided that the State expen
ditures for the designated purpo.-es
shall not exceed the amounts to be ex
pended for the same purposes by thÂ»
departments of the Federal Govern
ment, and that if any of the depart
ments do not contribute funds in co
operation the State Board of Examin
ers may enter into contracts with the
representatives of any of the depart
ments for the expenditure of any bal
ance, the amount not to exceed th?
amount to be expended by a depart
ment in collaboration with the State.
The bill relating to the lakes in the
northern counties provides for iha
construction of a large system.. foe. the
irrigation of lands and it Is estimated
that 300.000 acres can be reclaimed
near the Oregon line.

CAUSES OF NEIGHBORHOOD ROW
Prospect Avenue Housewives Wax Wroth at Being
Compelled to Abandon Home Tasks and
Holiday Shopping to Testify.
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Miss Pearl Cafllsh. 16 years of age
and short of stature, denied having
cast with intent to do bodily harm to
Mrs. Myrtle Brown the three small
pieces cf sandstone which that matron
carefully took from their newspaper
""Tapping and presented as material
evidence in support of her complaint.
That she did hurl a fragment of broom
etick at Mrs. Brown's cat Miss Caflish
admitted, but pleaded stress of provo
cation, the feline being notoriously
i Â»
predatory and sixteen of the Caflish
chickens having been assassinated and
partly eaten.
The Catiishes and the Browns are
r.trxt-door neighbors on the 200 block of
Prospect aver.ue. and the jury box of
Police Judge Cabaniss' court was
packed with housewives who had been
summoned to tell what they knew
alxmt the alleged peace disturbance.
Clerk Onlan and Bailiff Carmichael
experienced considerable difficulty in
restraining some of the subpenaed la-
Â«2i*-s from testifying before they were
called to the stand, and when the case
was dismissed without any of them
having been interrogated their Indig
nation was unanimous and undisguised.
"The idea of dragging me here and
then not letting me speak'." exclaimed
a midÂ£!e-a?ed woman of Amazonian
physique and mien, glaring angrily at
the Judge. "With my housework and
my Christmas shopping to do, here I've
been kept dawdling since 10 o'clock,
and now it's noon. Do you call that
justice?"
His Hor.or meekly explained that he
had not lured the lady away from her
househc-ld dtuies and holiday buying,
and mildly suggested that she transfer
her wrath to the person directly re
sponsible for her deprivation of those
tasks.
"Oh, you may talk," Ene rejoined,
"but talk's cheap." #
So frir-barrassed was his Honor by
the angry lady's arraignment that he
neglected to pun on Mrs. Josephine
Caflish's anouncement that she was
"mother of Pearl" and eager to testify
for the defense.
Mrs. Arastina Zennerman of 1055
Folsom street told Judge Mogan of how
she had been annoyed by Mrs. Annie
Demestine's penchant for borrowing
ere she caused that lady's arrest for
disturbing her peace.
Mrs. Zennerman and Mrs. Demestine
dwell within a few doors of each other
on Folscm street, and Mrs. Zennerman
testified that every time she received
a neighborly call from Mrs. Demestine
the latter borrowed provisions or fur
niture or cooking utensils, none of
which was ever returned. Mrs. Zenner
man bore her losses meekly, even re
fraining from expostulation when Mrs.
Demestine helped herself to tips from
the gas burners and uttering no ob
jection when her baby's raiment was
carried away to be worn by the Demes
tine infant.
"When she came in and saw my
baby's new dress," narrated Mrs. Zen
nerman. "she said, 'Oh. what a dear
little gown â I wonder how ray pet
would look in :t. I'll bring It back In
a few minutes:' But she never brought
it back." <
Mr. Zennerman, a tailor, also told of
Mrs. Demestine's passion for embellish
ing her house and her table and her
baby at his expense. He never went
abroad, he averred, th-it he did not find
something missing when he returned,
and inquiry invariably disclosed the
fact that it had been appropriated by
Mrs. Demestine.
Th<? rpecifle charge against Mrs.
Demestine was that of having

W. F. Buttle of 2971 Twenty-sixth

Joseph McGown by Joseph Smith,
was cross-examined by Attorney D. J.

that he saw McGowan put his hand
through the rail pate of the yard In
which the killing subsequently occurred

Carl Reiss, a German comedian out of
a Job. was singing the appeal as well
as his catarrhal cold would permit,
when Patrolman Dowd arrested him
for disturbing the peace of Market

at 2 oVlock yesterday morning. The
route to prison^ was made vocal by
Mr. Reiss and all night !ong^ he dis
turbed his fellow prisoners by" melodi

he hummed his commercial proposition
until Bailiff Laws squelched It.
When placed before the bench Mr.

he said, "mine heart felt so sunk down

Five rooms of Mrs. Maggie Sharp's

ing Mr. Nicholson of disturbing the

p. m. till midnight of the day men
tioned he cursed 1 and threatened his
wife so loudly as greatly to annoy a

! fore Judge Mogan, denied that his voice
was raised to sufficient pitch to be audi
ble beyond the confines of his own

of Mrs. Nicholson consumed as long
a period as the complainant averred.
While seated at dinner with his family,
Mr. Nicholson explained, he mildly re
proved one of his children for convey
ing food to its mouth with a knife,
whereupon Mrs. Nicholson bridled up
and declared that she, being as con

against his usurpation of prerogative.

About Wife and Daughter
Unduly Influenced Him
"With only a few hours of the year
remaining In which she could begin
proceedings,^ Mrs. Edle W. Gonzales last
evening filed her promised contest of
the~will of her late husband. Dr. Ma
riano E. Gonzales. The day, until after
the hour for adjournment of court, had
been occupied In argument before
Judge Kerrigan upon, her petition to set
aside $75,000 worth of . land as a
homestead. To protect herself against
the possibility of tiot receiving the acres
applied for the contest was filed. The
County Clerk's office had been closed,
but the document was received, as in
another day the action would have been
barred.
The contest suit Is against Robert F.
Johnson, trustee of the Gonzales es
tate; Anita Gonzales, the daughter by
a former marriage, and the forty
grandchildren of Francisco Rico, who
was a half-brother of Gonzales. In the
will the property was left to Johnson in
trust, with directions to divide the in
come among the daughter, the widow
and the Rico heirs, the widow's Interest
to last only so long as she remained
unmarried.
Gonzales died December 6. 1903, and
the will was dated November 13 of the
same year. The widow makes the
usual allegations of defective execu
tion. She also charges that he was not

FIRE COMMISSIONERS HOLD
REGULAR WEEKLY' MEETING
John T. Titus and Charley Thoney Arc
Scored by Board for Their
" Money Transactions.
The Fire Commissioners held. their
regular weekly meeting yesterday.
President J. George Boyne, Henry P.
Weeden and J. S.' Parry were present.
First Assistant Chief Dougherty also
took part In the proceedings.
John T. Titus, hoseman of Engine 6.
was up before the board, charged with
having assigned his pay account to a
money broker, in violation of the
board's rules. A charge was also
brought against him by the United Un
dertakers' Association that he had re
fused to pay a claim of $59. This
claim was for the funeral expenses of
his brother-in-law. The account had
been standing a year and a half.
The board ordered Titus to make ar
rangements for settling the claim
within twenty-four hours or he would
be placed on the suspended list. Act
ing Chief Dougherty scored Titus heav
ily for his actions.
Charles Thoney, driver of Truck 7,
was before the board on a charge of
borrowing $20 from John Kilkenny on
August 27, 1904, which he refused to
pay.
Thoney said he only. owed Kilkenny
$0. The evidence of E. Malarkey and
Patrick Doran substantiated Kilken
ny's statement, although Thoney's lit
tle 14-year-old son swore that the
amount Kilkenny had given him to
hand to his father was only $9.
Thoney was ordered to square the ac
count on December 29, otherwise he
would be under the ban. ; i:
Commissioner Parry scored the.dif
ferent members of the Fire; Depart
ment who were continually* getting into
trouble by having their accounts
brought up for settlement before the
board.

ELLIS DENIES
HE ATTACKED
CHIEF WITTMAN
SEYMOUR IS INDIGNANT
Fear Expressed That Impending
Police Investigation Has Been
Started Wrong.
f/Y CAXXOT understand how a statement snch as that
i which credited me with hnvlnc told ex-Captain Sey
mour that Chief Wittman gave me 'secret orders*
could have sot Into print. I never said to Captain Seymour
or to the. Grand Jury or to any one else that Chief Wittman
gave me 'secret orders' not to raid the Chinese games. That
was a terrible charge to make against Wittman, and I can
not understand how It could have gained credence. The only
instructions I erer received from the Chief were those Just as
was stated in The Call yesterday morning, that are desig
nated the 'regular written instructions' and which are Issued
from time to time to the Chinatown and other squads.
"I was before the Grand Jury again last night, but I
cannot repeat any of the testimony that was there given.
You know that it would not be proper for me to tell the
secrets of the conference. I cannot say whether I was ques
tioned about my alleged attack on the heads of the depart
ment, but I can say that I have never accused . them as has
been charged."â Statement by Police Sergeant Thomas P.
Eiiis. i ;^::
Developments in the police scandal
yesterday seemed to point, to a con
spiracy within a conspiracy. While
there has been. circumstantial evidence
to show that some sort of corruption
fund has been collected in Chinatown
and that some sort of tribute is levied
on the women of the under world, there
has thus far been little to show that
any one high in authority In civic ad
ministration is involved.
Opportunity to arrive at an intelligent
investigation of the* alleged bribery of
police in the districts mentioned seems
to have become hopelessly entangled in
the meshes of misinterpreted law and
the nets spread by disgruntled persons
to trap the unwary object of their in
dividual wrath.
This much was learned from Sergeant
Ellis yesterday:
"I have not made any statement in
criminating Chief of Police Wittman,
or any other head of the police depart
ment. rTi'.'-
"I have not told Captain John Sey
mour, ex-chief of detectives, that I had
evidence incriminating the Chief and
members of the administration.
"I am simply defending myself
against what I think are unjust accusa
tions. T do not want to involve any
one; I am not looking for trouble, I
only want to get out of it."
To further complicate matters the Jur
isdiction of the police committee of the
Grand Jury has been -..questioned.
Friends of men -who â  have . been sum
moned as witnesses -'have called atten
tion to the fact vthat the committee,
acting independently of the main body,
has no legal right ' to subpena wit
nesses or hold out a witness, as they
did in. the Ellis. case. Rooms have been
engaged by the Grand Jury in the Mills
building, although quarters are provid
ed for that body in the X:ity Hall. This
is said to be unusual.
The members of the Grand Jury, on
the other hand, say that they have im
portant" work before them and that it
is necessary for them to meet at some
down town office that can be easily
reached from their respective places of
business. They decline to explain who
is paying for the rooms â the city or
public-minded citizens.
SERGEANT ELLJS' POSITION.
Sergeant Ellis is much care-worn and
almost prostrated. Yesterday morning
he was told to report at the Harbor
Police Station, but the Grand Jurymen
took the position that he was not sub
ject to the orders of tae Chief of Po
lice so long as he was a witness before
that inquisitorial body. Here is where
the question of the police committee's
Jurisdiction was brought up, and it
was contended that under legal circum
stances the sergeant should be at his
post of duty and not held In the back
ground at the city's expense. Late. in
the afternoon the sergeant appeared at
the Harbor Station and greeted his
comrades of the force there. Much
sympathy is felt for him, as he is sup
posed to have been annoyed by the
persistent efforts of his temporary
friends to say something that would
substantiate charges brought by Hut
ton/
"I cannot talk." said the sergeant, "I
am now on my way to the City Hall
and I am under orders to keep quiet."
- The sergeant did not care to say any
thing' about- his conversations with
Hutton or. any other of the Police Com
missioners. He would not. of course,
divulge the questions put to him by the
committee of the Grand Jury. He Is,
as The Call has already explained, sim
ply on the defensive and has not made
any charge that 'Implicates his supe
riors. .
The mystery now isâ who has been
attempting to turn the opportunity of
bringing the Chinatown Investigation
Into a farce?
HUTTON IS WAITING.
â¢ Police Commissioner Hutton may be
able to tell something about the In
vestigation instigated by him .some
weeks ago, but for the present he will
take no steps in that direction. Until
the Grand. Jury Is through â¢ with its
prc-bing he will "remain to all visible
signs, passive. For the present the Po
lice Commissioners will have to pass
the matter over, as it would not- be
legal , for them -to _ question, witnesses
that * have been told to appear before
the jury to answer queries put to them
concerning police affairs." After the
jury finishes with its witnesses the
Police Board may see fit to resummon
them.
At an adjourned meeting of the Board
of Police Commissioners yesterday
afternoon the Sergeant Ellis ; matter
was casually mentioned. Commissioner
Drinkhouse asked his associates on
the board what action they Intended
taking, regarding Ellis' alleged'Confes
sion, -whereupon Hutton spoke up and
said that; he had been Informed bjr
District 'Attorney Bylngton that the
commission .would . be In contempt If it
attempted ." to~compel .".Ellis to'^ testify
before" it while he was a witness before
the Grand Jury. The commission then
put the matter over indefinitely.
"By the time the Grand Jury is
through with Its investigation of the
police conditions that have prevailed
In Chinatown it will make, the recom
mendation that a large part of the
force be made up of new policemen,"
said District Attorney Bylngton yes
terday. It was a very significant re
mark and indicates that In his judg
ment the inquisitorial body is on' the
trail of a good case.
The District Attorney was in attend
ance on the Grand Jury yesterday aft
ernoon, but he was no less wary of the
press representatives than the Jurors
themselves. He had heard the general
discussion of the work of the police
committee, but refused to divulge any
thing.
He expressed the opinion, however,
that it would be some time before the
Grand Jury would take definite action
concerning the police scandal, and that
the public would have to wait patiently
for a considerable period for Informa
tion as to what was being done in the
investigation. This statement gave
the Impression that no strong case has
yet been made out, and particularly
that the statements of Sergeant Ellis
were not of the clinching character re
ported.
Captain John Seymour, formerly at
the head of the city's detective force,
was mentioned yesterday as a personal
friend to whom Ellis had confided that
Chief Wittman gave him Instructions
not to molest the gambling games In
Chinatown. The captain Is not involved
in the affair.'
SEYMOUR DENIES IT.
"Sergeant Ellis has made no state
ment whatever to me," declared Sey
mour. "He came to me for advice
when Commissioner Hutton preferred
the charges of neglect of duty against
him. and 'all* I. had to say to him was
to tell the truth. He did not tell me
that Chief Wittman gave him secret
orders regarding the games in China
town nor anything else that would
tend to incriminate any one. From ex
perience I have learned that this thing
of standing pat and of helping anybody
out of trouble Is bad policy. As I
would tell any other friend who ap
pealed to me for my opinion and ad
vice I told Ellis to tell the truth"
"Did . Sergeant Ellis indicate to you
that he had been withholding the
truth?" Captain Seymour was asked.
"He did not."
"But your advice to him .makes it
appear that you thought he had some
thing to tell and had been withholding
it?"
"You can assume what you like.
Ellis never said a word to me of what
had been going on In Chinatown. He
did not mention the name of Chief
Wittman, Abe Ruef, Mayor Schmitz,
Detective Jerry Dlnan or any one else.
He simply came to me and said he
was in trouble and wanted me to tell
him what was best to do. I did not
want to know of what he might tell,
for -I" did not wish to mix up in the
matter, and he did not offer to tell me
anything. We have been friends for
many years and I simply gave him the
bpst : advice I couldâ to tell the truth."
â¢â '.'Again you Indicate that you be
lieved that he had not yet told all and
your advice Indicates that you were
urging him to make a clean breast of
the situation in Chinatown."
"I did not know a thing about it. I
hadn't . the remotest idea whether he
v.-as" in "possession of damaging facts or
not. He said he was in trouble and I
advised him to do as I have already
stated.".
"Do you know what Ellis has told
the : grand jurors?"
"I do not. I believe he has told them
something that is Important, but just
what it is 1 haven't the remotest idea...
I don't care who is hurt, so long as my
friend Ellis tells the truth. The whole
matter is of no interest to me. You
can say without equivocation that Ellis
never divulged any incriminating facts
to me and that the report' to the effect
that he' told me Chief Wittman gave
him secret orders is utterly without
foundation."
At the afternoon session of the Grand
Jury yesterday the police scandal was
r.ot > taken up formalryJ There was a
general -discussion, of the investigation
that is being ; conducted by . the â  police
committee and the members of it were
given every encouragement to go ahead
with .their labors. Strict secrecy was
observed as to, what occurred.
POLICE COSDinTEE MEETS.
The police committee of the Grand
Jury was in session four hours last
night and a number of policemen who
have been members of the 'Chinatown
3quad at various times were called to

REDDING, Dec- 23. â William Jones,
a Redding youth, held up a Chinese
vegetable grower on the Anderson road,
three miles south of Redding, last Sun
day to get money for a woman with
whom he was infatuated. He got Jl 70.
Sunday afternoon he was arrested and
stoutly maintained his. innocence
Tuesday he was preliminarily examined
and an attorney made a hard fight to
prove an alibi. This afternoon young
Jones appeared in the Superior Court
and pleaded guilty.
In sentencing him to but two years'
imprisonment Judge Head said that
because t)f the youth of the prisoner
and other mitigating circumstances a
sentence of two years would answer
the ends of Justice.
Death of a Well Known Telegrapher,.
CHICAGO, Dec. 23. â Thomas Ryan,

Deceased was born in Staunton, Va.
declared that the utmost harmony
prevailed.
Sergeant Ellis had another brief ses
sion with the committee. AtUred In
full uniform he came under the care
ful guard of Juror Bowes. On one
occasion Ellis ventured a remark to
the newspaper men and was roundly
lectured for it by the juror.
Sergeant Christiansen was a witness
last night. The others called were
Policemen McGrath, O'Brien, Munn.
Heinz and'Farrel. They all said they
had received no secret instructions
from Chief Wittman or any one else
as to the games In Chinatown. Noth
ing important was accomplished and
the proceedings had an air of much
ado about nothing.
That the iron Is not waxing hot was
indicated by the fact that the com
mittee adjourned without a day. A
special meeting may be called Tues
day or Wednesday, but Foreman An
drews said the committee would prob
ably not meet, again before the ses
sion of the full Grand Jury next Fri
day.
An Indictment was found against

The charges against Patrolmen John

they accepted a bribe from George
Mero, a saloon-keeper at Devisadero
and Sutter. streets, was dismissed by
the Police , Commission yesterday,
Howell and Regan voting for acquittal
and Drinkhouse and Hutton for con
viction.' The tie vote stands for ac
quittal and the patrolmen returned to
their duties. . *.:'-<% /: V
George Mero; his brother, Edward
Mero, and Dan Donohue, a barkeeper,
were the principal- witnesses against
the accused patrolmen. They said
they were running a turkey raffle In
tho rear of McDonald & Mero's saloon
and the patrolmen took exception to
their, manner of operating the game
and threatened to report them for
shaking dice for money. To save the
license' of *the place, Mero said, he
gave Berrle $2 and McGorty $2 50.
The accused policemen, however,
told straight' stories of their dealings
with Mero; testified that they called
at the saloon to see If gambling un
der the guise of a turkey raffle was
proceeding, and. suspecting that such
was the case, but being unable to ob
tain direct evidence, they subsequently
called at the saloon and warned Mero
that -the place would be reported to
the captain of the district if any fur
ther-ground- of suspicion was dis
covered.
The witnesses for the prosecution
hopelessly* contradicted themselves
and one another, with the result that
the patrolmen were acquitted.

VICTORIA. B. C, Dec. 23.âDiffer
ences have arisen between the com
monwealth of Australia and Germany
with regard to the exclusive policy
adopted by Germany in the South Pa
cific. The question arose after the
steamer Tsabel had been held by the
Germans until an exorbitant license of
$2250 per month was paid for trading in
the Marshall group. Then a duty of $3
a ton was imposed upon copra shipped
in the grcup on British vessels which
trade from Australian ports.
Australia is considerably aroused
over Germany's Interference with thÂ«
commonwealth's commercial activity la
the South Seas and there is talk of re
prisals. Negotiations are expected to
take place regarding the matter, Aus
tralia having presented her grievances
to London.
Australian papers publish strong ar

Germany ?s strengthening her "octopus

excluslveness in the Carolines, Solo

If the statements in a letter received

cisco are true, this is not the first time
the 'doctor" and his step-son have
used this means to add to their store
of r.orldly goods. Mrs. Fleming says
in her letter that a short time ago she
*vas "bunkoed" in the same manner by
the pair, and she declares that if her
testimony will help to convict them
the is ready to testify against them.
Tfci*. however, is not all the evidence
pgainft Proctor and Asberry. Mrs.
Tyson has also received a letter from a
woman in this citv, who makes the
fame charges against the "doctor" as
does Mrs. Fleming. In the latter case
Mr?. Tyson refuses to reveal the name
of her correspondent, but it ha? been
learned that the writer accused Proctor
of obtaining money and valuable?. She
also is quite ready to testify against
the doctor and his 5tep-eon.
There are two separate charges of
grand larceny against each of the ac
cused men, one for the theft of 5108 in
cash and the other for stealing two
diamond rings. Mrs. Ty?on says that
during the visit of the "doctor" to her
house he took the ring?, which were
in a jewel box. and. Flipping one on his
finger, put the other in his pocket.
When she asked him to give them back
he refused, ' saying he would return
them later. One of the rings was a clus
ter of diamonds and the other was pet
with two large stones. Later, when
Proctor and Asberry were arrested, the
rings were returned to the owner.
Neither of the accused made any
statement at the examination to-day,
The wife of Proctor visited her hus

FLEES RATHER
THAN PAY WIFE
William Dunn Leaves County
to Escape the Payment of
Alimony Ordered by Court
JUDGE ISSUES WARRANT
Fugitive Will Be Arrested
and Imprisoned Until He
Obeys Judicial Mandate
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 23.
Rather than to pay his wife alimony
William Dunn of Newark has given
up his business there and fled the
country. A commitment to the County
Jail was issued by Judge Ellsworth
this afternoon and placed in the hands
of Sheriff John X. Bishop. Dunn is a
molder. and with his brother conducts
a stove foundry at Newark. '
His wife got a divorce from him
some months ago' and he was ordered
to pay her $25 a month alimony. He
failed to do this and last week was
ftitc-d to appear before the court. He
then got one more week in which to
pay the money, now amounting to 595.
His time was up to-day, but it appears
that he withdrew his card from the
Molders' Union some day? ago and has
left the State. His mother has moved
to Alameda. He vowed that he never
would pay his v.ife a cent of alimony,
and in order not to do so has left the
county.
Kmelie Paulovich was told 'by Judge
Meivin to-day that before she could
have the custody of her two children
5he must prove untrue the charges
made by her husband. Stephen Paulo
vich, when he got a divorce some time
ago. He then charged that she was
living at Truckee with one George Saz- j
zalo. She made no defense, but lately j
visited friends here and says she found j
her two children neglected and dirty,
and took step3 to regain their, custody.
I William M. Downs got a divorce this
afternoon from Grace F. Downs on
the ground of her desertion. She re
ceives 5200 of the community property,
and the father has the custody of the
two children.
Suit for divorce has been brought
by JIary M. McDonald against William
McDonald on the ground of desertion.
KINIRY SAYS
"NOT GUILTY"
Self-ConfessedBiirglarJUakes
Appearance in Superior
Court on Murder Charge
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 23.
David Kiniry, charged with the mur
der of Policeman James H. Smith, was
arraigned before Judge Hall in the Su
perior Court this morning and pleaded
"not guilty." He was self-possessed
and told the court that he had not yet
selected his attorney. Judge Hall ask
ed if he wished him to appoint counsel,
kiniry accepted the suggestion and
Attorneys H. H. Gentry and E. S. Page
were appointed. Kiniry was anxious to
plead and did so against the advice of
the attorneys appointed, but the court
said that the plea might be entered
with the understanding that it could be
withdrawn in ten days if so desired.
Kiniry has confessed that he was
waiting for an opportunity to enter a
house about 7 o'clock one night in No
vember, 1903, with a partner by the
name of Goldstein, when they were ar
rested by Policeman Smith, who was
fired on and mortally wounded. Smith
returned the fire and Goldstein was
killed. Kiniry got away, but was re
cently arrested at Los Angeles and
identified by a porcelain tooth. He says
he did not shoot Smith.
Further formalities in regard to the
trial were postponed until January 3,
when the case comes up to be set.

TAKES HIS MANSION
FROM ITS GROUNDS
CHURCH AND BUSINESS, tit! KNOWLES
KNOWLES MANSION, WHICH WILL BE REMOVED BODILY FROM ITS PRESENT SITE, AND A DIAGRAM SHOWING THE
LOCATION OF THE MARSHAL BLOCK AND THE EPWORTH M. E. CHURCH. THE CORNERSTONE OF WHICH WAS
LAID YESTERDAY. WHICH THE CAPITALIST OBJECTS TO AS NEIGHBORS.
BERKELEY, Dec. 23. â Disgusted
because his millions have failed to pro
cure for him immunity from the en
croachments of business and church
people, W. E. Knowles, a former Klon
dike Croesus, now a prominent resi
dent of Berkeley, has given orders to
have his magnificent mansion at Du
rant and Telegraph avenues removed
entire from the handsome grounds it
has hitherto adorned.'
Despite the fact that Mr. Knowles
when he built his imposing home four
years ago bought enough land as a site
for a dozen ordinary homes the area
has not proved sufficiently large to
protect him from a large business
block which J. A. Marshall, another
Berkeley capitalist, is erecting in the
rear of Knowles' mansion nor to pre
serve him from the close association
which the new Epworth Methodist
Church has provided for the Knowlea
menage.
A fortune was put Into the Knowles
home, its value being estimated at
$40,000, but despite its elaborate char
acter and its great size every vestige
of it is to be moved from the corner
of Durant and Telegraph avenues.
Workmen began yesterday the task of
transferring the mansion to the new
home site recently bought.
CORNERSTONE LAID.
While the church people of Berke
ley and the Masonic fraternity gather
ed to-day to lay the cornerstone of
the Epworth Church, across from the
Knowles home, a gang of men were
busy preparing to move the mansion
so that it no longer would face the
church or be in its neighborhood.
Two other wealthy men, residents,
whose homes are close to Mr.
Knowles', are planning to either move
their handsome houses or lease them
OIL PAINTINGS SUBJECT
OF A LEGAL ACTION
Ownership of Six Cnnvases Valued at
$1500 Disputed in San Jose
Court.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 23.â Six oil paint
ings valued at $1500 are the basis of
a suit filed in the Superior Court-to
day by W. H. -Hunt, a. baker, against
Mrs. M. J. Whitlock and Henry
French. The paintings involved were
painted by Artist P. L. Peters and are
entitled "Fairies," "Dove," "La France
Roses," "Storm on the Coast," "Chrys
anthemums" and "Judith."
Peters sold the paintings to Hunt
and Mrs. Whitlock secured possession
of them for a debt before they ;came
into the possession of Hunt. A de

Hunt or their value* In cash.'; which 13
placed at $1500...

accepted him, "am I really, your first

and build elsewhere. S. Page, living
at Bancroft way and Telegraph ave
nue, close to the business block which
J. A. " Marshall is erecting and near
the Epworth Church, is one of these
citizens, who Is preparing to call in the (
house-mover, and Louis Titus, resid-"
Ing across the street from Mr.
Knowles, is another.
Each of these men has a splendid
mansion, surrounded with elaborate
grounds, and all are indignant that
the fashionable residence section of
Berkeley, which they fancied was to
be exclusively for the rich residing
there, has been invaded by the busi
ness block, the apartment house and
the Methodist church.
Mr. Knowles has bought a large lot
on Durant avenue, north of Telegraph
avenue, closer to the foothills, and
there workmen are preparing to receive
the Knowles establishment when it has
been taken from Its present site.
CROWDS INTERESTED.
Crowds of curious persons gather
daily in front of the Knowles mansion,
watching the spectacle of a million
aire's palace being taken entire, with
all its inhabitants, away from a spot
which long has been one of the show
places of the city, to a new location.
Mry Knowles .grimly surveyed the
crowd to-day and remarked:
It's tough to liave ' your home treated . this
way. but I'm going to try the experiment of
moving the house, big as it is. Instead of
building a new one. The, folks like this house
and we won't give it up. Do I object to the
church? Well, churches usually are not con
sidered desirable additions to a first-class. red.
dence district, but 1 don't care to be put In
the attitude of objecting to them. I do object
to a big business block being built adjoining
my home, but as I can't, prevent it I'm going
to take up my house and go.
I understand that Mr. Gale and Mr. Titus
are also to move. They live across from the
church and the business block. Some one'U
going to put up an apartment hense in the rear
of the church later, and that won't be exactly
a desirable thing. What am I going to do
with tlie property here â the land I am leav
ing? Haven't decided yet..
FIRE IN LOS ANGELES
CAUSES LOSS OF $100,000
Two-Story Brick Bnildlnp Occupied
x by Paper Finn Is Destroyed
by Flames.
LOS ANGELES, . Dec. 23. â Fire this
morning destroyed the two-story brick
building at the northwest corner .of
ltequina and Commercial streets, oc
cupied by the Pioneer Roll . Paper
Company, entailing a loss to building
and stock estimated at $100,000. The
origin of the "fire is unknown.
The Pioneer Roli" Paper Company
carried the largest '. : stock of paper In
Southern California and it sustained
practically a complete loss. â¢ In addi
tion several printing presses and other
machinery/were ruined.
â¢ Willie â I met our new minister on
my way to Sunday school, mamma,
and.-, he asked me if I ever played
marbles on Sunday. ...
Motherâ H'h! And what did you
say to that?-- â¢ . ,' .
Willieâ I said. VGet thee behind; me,
Satan!" and ''walked right oft and left
him:â London Tit-Bits.
The church people do not coincide in
the view that their building could
handicap the value "of residence prop
erty. They are to spend nearly $30,000
on the structure and think It will be
a thing of beauty. They watched the
workmen .removing Knowles' home
away from them to-day, but regretted
merely that \the Alaskan millionaire
was depriving himself of such excel
lent spiritual company.
MASONS OFFICIATE.
The cornerstone of the new Epworth
Methodist Church was laid under the
auspices of Durant Lodge, F. and
A. M., of Berkeley. The exercises were
elaborate and impressive. "Under the
leadership of Worshipful Master Wal
ter Gompertz members of the Masonic
fraternity marched from the I. O. O. F.
Hall to the church site, where hundreds
of church officials and 'members were
present. The Masonic Quartet of Oak
land, composed of D. M. Lawrence, H.
W. Patrick) Alfred Wilkle and William
Neilsen, sang ."Hail, Glorious Morn."
Rev. J. A. Batchelor ottered prayer,
"Coronation" was sung and Rev. Clar
ence F. Reid, agent of the board of
missions, delivered' an address appro
priate to the occasion.
Rev. J. C. Simmons, a veteran min
ister, read the church ritual prescribed
forsuch events, and William H. Waste,
president of the board of trustees of
the church, invited Grand Master
George* W. Hunter to lay the corner
stone. The grand master responded in
an elo<iuent address.
The -Masonic Quartet rendered other
significant songs and the cornerstone
was then laid according to che Masonic
ritual.
The church is to-be of gothic design,
the plans calling for an edifice which
is expected to be worthy of Berkeley's
reputation as a city of beautiful homes
and churches.

POLICE BOARD
DROPS HEARING
Commissioners Consider the
Accusations Against Bert
Henderson i to Be Flimsy
ACCUSER IS CHANGED
Four New Names Added to
the Roster to Fill Vacancies
in the Roll of -Department
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Dec. 23.
â¢. Regular Policeman Bert Henderson
was vindicated to-day at an investiga
tion by the Police and Fire Commis
sioners of accusations of theft made
against him by Special Officer August
J. Jacobson.
Mayor Warren Olney and City Attor
ney J. E. McElroy of the Police Board,
who conducted the examination,
agreed that the statements made by
Jacobson were too flimsy- and indefinite
to warrant. any action against Hender
son., Ou motion of Mayor Olney the
matter, was dismissed.
Charges of making false assertions
against a brother officer with the pur
pose of injuring him. which had been
preferred by Chief of Po'.lce Hodgkins
against Jacobson, v.ill be investigated
by the Police Commissioners.
Jacobson and Henderson were called
before the investigators. There were
no other witnesses. Jacobson reiterated
the assertion that he had seen Hender
son take a bucket of paint from the
residence of Mrs. M. Gardner, at Third
avenue and East Fifteenth street; that
he had at another time observed Hen
derson pick up an artificial fire log in a
vacant house in East Oakland, and
that on still another occasion he saw
Henderson riding a wheel, which Ja
cobson thought belonged to an em
ploye at the F. M. Smith place, in East
Oakland. When closely questioned
Jacobson admitted that he was unable
to tell what Henderson had done with
the paint, that the bicycle was not sto
len and that he did not see Henderson
take the artificial fire log home. Jacob
son also admitted that he did not har
bor the friendliest of feelinga'for Hen
derson, because he sa-id Henderson had
at one time refused to speak to him
and had also spoken unfavorably of the
witness to one of Jacobson's patrons.
Henderson denied that he ever took
any paint from the Gardner house and
affirmed that he had received permis
sion to use the bicycle at the Smith
place and that he had picked up the
artificial fire log in the. vacant house to
put it in a more secure place. Hender
son further stated that he had boarded
Jacobson for a month and was finally
compelled, to order him to keep,, away
from the Henderson house because of
erratic conduct:. .' .'
William F. Woods and Charles A. F.
Jorgensen were appointed regular po
lice officers and Charles 'F. McCarthy
and Thomas A. Boyle were named as
acting- regular police officers.
Resolutions deploring the murder of
Policeman George W. Brown by an un
known man and extending sympathy to
the bereaved family of the dead patrol
man were adopted.

Engine of a Eerlieley Flyer
Kills Hiero Cornell Near
the Emeryville "Racetrack
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 23.
Hiero Cornell, lately from Porter
ville, was killed by a Berkeley local
train at 5 o'clock this afternoon as he
was crossing the railway tracks near
the Judson Iron Works. He was em
ployed at the Emeryville racetrack by
E. B. Jennings, but had done a few
days' work at the iron works and was
going to the works when the Berkeley
flyer, on its way to the mole, struck
him and threw him into the ditch be
side the tracks. His head was crushed
and he died before he reached the
Receiving Hospital. The train stopped
and picked him up and he was taken
to the "mole and transferred to the
Seventh-street local and taken off at
Broadway.

3Iajority Jury Verdicts.
. Several States have laws permitting
majority verdicts to be returned by
juries in civil and criminal cases, the
concurrence of from 'two- thirds to five
sixths of the jurors being necessary.
The trouble with the present system la
that when jurora refuse to- sacrifice
their convictions- there is a. costly and
unnecessary disagreement. The cause
of justice ' would be served by a two
thirds vote in civil cases and a five
sixths vote in criminal case?. Another
advantage to be gained by the change
would be that the corruption of, jurors
then would be a more elaborate, costly
and dangerous process. â Ne\v v n ,t

Victor Sails ob R^et WMU 0rew 5MmbÂ®rs
The morning of the da>- the Oceanic
Steamship Company's liner Mariposa.
Captain Lawiess, left Tahiti there ar-
r:\ied at that tropic port a tiny dory
in which five shipwrecked traders had
voyaged for 11- days," with little food
and less water. The men, emaciated
arid worn out from constant toil at the
oars and frequent battles with sharks,
hungry as themselves, were taken to
the Government hospital at Papeete,
where they told of the wreck of their
vessel, the little French trading
schooner Victor.
Discipline on the Victor seems to
have been of the catch-as-catch-can
kind. At 2 a. m. on November 30 the
Victor, with Captain Sara Harris and
Ins crew of four, al! below and sound
asleep, was sailing the summer seas
a.t her own sweet will. There was no
lookout to hear the roar of the surf
breaking on Apataki Island, no helms
man to turn the schooner's nose from
the. coral reef â which like a line of
infantry was ambushed and waiting
with bayonets set directly in the path
of the little boat.
The Victor sailed to her doom with
all the abandon of a woman stepping
backward off a moving car. And the
result was about the same. The crash
aroused the sleepers, who managed to
make their way through the breakers
to dry land. In the morning they re
covered a dory, a little food and six
vocoanuts. The island of Apataki is
barren of vegetation and* without
water. Tahiti. 200 miles' away, was
the nearest refuge.
The live men embarked in the dory-
No friendly breeze lightened their la
bors, no rain came from the sky to fill
the empty water kegs. They had to
row every weary loot of the 200 miles
to Tahiti an<J the milk in the half
dozen cocoanuts was the sole liquid re
freshment that moistened the lips of
the shipwrecked five.
The dory was smail and the weight
of five men brought its gunwales close
to the water's edge. Sharks became
interested in the five* dainty tidbits
almost within reach and more than
once two of the oarsmen had to cease
rowing and with their oars drive away
the more persistent of the maneaters.
Harris and his men were in bad
shape when they reached Tahiti, but
ft was thought that all would recover.
The Mariposa brought from Tahiti
a cargo of tropical products and a
score of passengers, most of whom
were tourists, who have been enjoying
the novelty of summer sunshine and
-.yarmth in the middle of winter. G. A.
Batchelder ar.d wife, who returned on
the Mr.riposa, spent more than a
rr.or.th at Tahiti and left with reluct
ance. So delighted is Batchelder with
tht climate of the South Sea island
that he intends to return there very
soon. F. Levy, the pearl king, and his
wife came up on the Mariposa. They
p.re going to London, a trip they make
once a year. Captain S. Kiggins, who
v. ..Â« well known here up to sixteen
5<ars agro as a trader between here
arid the South Seas, was a passenger
on the Marlposa with his two sons.
Kiggins is in business on Raiatea and
is said to be prosperous. T. A. Grady,
traveling passenger agent of the
Oceanic Steamship Company, came up
onfthe Mariposa.
Following is a list of the passengers:
F. I>evy and wife. Miss A. Levy, G. A.

CUTLER MOUNTAIN VICTIM
' MAY BE CRIPPLE CREEK GIRL.
Colorado Springs Police Searching for
Miss' Minnie tSwift, Who Is
. Missing.
COLORADO SPRINGS, DecJ 23. â
The police of this city and the Cripple
Creek district are searching for Miss
Minnie Swift, a young woman who left
her home in Cripple Creek on Decem
ber 8 to spend several weeks in Colo
rado. She is said, to; answer the de
scription of the Cutler Mountain vic
tim. She has not been heard from by
her family since she left her home.
The city chemist has to-day'ana
lyzed the contents of the bottle found
near the scene-of the murder and pro
nounces it pure carbolic acid. The
bottle is full, however, and is believed
by â  the ' officers â¢ to be in no way con
nected with the crime. The police are
abandoning the Idea* that the mur
dered girl lived in this vicinity and
areÂ»depending upon the circulation of
a detailed description of her teeth to
ultimately reveal her identity.
Chief Reynolds has < also been working
upon a report made 'by Conductor Al
len of the Cripple Creek Short Line to
the effect that he carried a girl an
swering the description of the victim
from Cripple Creek to Rosemount about
three weeks ago.
Sheriff Grimes to-day received a tele
gram from Sheriff Norman of Jackson,
Cal., asking the local officer to compare
the description of Hoxie, who left
that town with Dr^F. N. Stapels some
six weeks ago, with that of the un
known body. The Sheriff says the de
scriptions do not tally in any way and
so instructed . Sheriff Norman.
Many stories are being sent out of
the finding of clothing, but according to"
Chief Reynolds there is absolutely no
truth in the reports and the officers are
as much in the dark as ever.\

PAPEETE, Tahiti, Dec. 10.â The
Pitcairn Islanders residing in Tahiti

the wreck of the Pitcairn Island cut
ter. One of the , passengers named
Coffin was drowned. Three young men
managed to make their escape by
swimming eight miles in a very rough
sea. ,
It appears that shortly before the
vessel foundered most of the passen
gers were sent to the island in the
ship's boat, where -they succeeded in
making ; a -,\ successful landing. The
crew remained by the vessel, standing
off during a furious . gale, finding no
opportunity to beach it.
" A â  cutter arrived from the "upper
Tuamotu Islands on December 10,
bringing news that the French
schooner Victor, foundered on jthe
reef at Apataki, about December 5.
Two spars were saved, but the cargo
of the ship was a total loss. No lives
were lost. '

HOLIDAY TRADE
IS VERY BRISK
Demand for Christmas Goods
Is Steady and Exceeds
Expectations of Dealers
STAPLE ARTICLES QUIET
Railwa3 r Gross Earnings Are
Greater Than During the
Same Period Last Year
NEW YORK. Dec 24.â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say:
Holiday trade and retail business
generally holds the center of the stage,
wholesale business and speculative
stocks and staples quieting down. In
some lines of Industry, too, seasonable
influences make for quiet, but a
marked exception . is noted in iron
and steel, which display activity and
strength and still further advances on
crude and finished products.
Railway gross earnings are up to
the best of the year and exceed all
previous periods at this time. Net re
turns Indicate present profitable . ope
rations about making up for lessened
earnings earlier in the year. A pre
liminary survey indicates close to. if
not in excess of, record proportions In
holiday business, except In some por
tions of the south and the Pacific Coast.
Among the metals tin and copper
alone show weakness. Leather is firm:
lumber is steady. Wool is strong, sup
plies are limited, one-third of next
year's clip is sold in advance, and the
high cost of material makes for higher
finished products.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending December 22 num
ber 249, against 239 last year, and 243
in this week of 1903.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 37, as against 37 last week and 15
last year.
Wheat (including flour) exports for
the week aggregate 1.0S0.70S bushels,
against 1,444,850 last week and 2,335.606
last year. From July 1 to date the
exports aggregate 33,777,187 bushels,
against 53,225,550 last year.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review of
Trade will say:
Demand for holiday goods has ex
ceeded expectations, but trade in sta
ple merchandise is seasonably quiet.
Business conditions are. satisfactory,
manufacturing plants producing freely,
except where, insufficient water supply
restricts 'operations, and a large vol
ume of option trading was recorded for
the week at the leading commercial ex
changes. Dispatches from the leading
cities are encouraging. Traffic returns
continue favorable. Railroad earnings
for December thus far exceeded last
year's by 7.6 per cent. Foreign com
merce at this port during, the last
week showed increases of $1,415,369 in
exports and $2,0S9,05S in imports, as
compared with the same week In 1903.
Irregularity continues in the hide
market. Limited receipts maintain
previous advances in foreign dry hides.
Failures this week numbered 251 Â«in
the United States, against 284 last year
and 32 in Canada, compared with
20 two years ago.

FRANCIS GIVES
HIS TESTIMONY
Refuses to Divulge Name of
Exposition Director Who
Made Charge Against Blair
GIVEN FINANCIAL AID
Friends of Deceased Raised
$35,000 to Take Up Note
Held Against Him bv Bank
ST. LOUIS. Dec. 22.â The testimony
of Thomas C. McPheeters.. for many
years an intimate friend of the late
James L. Blair, was the feature to-day
in the suit brought by a New York life
insurance company to annul a 5200.000
policy on the life of Blair.
McPheeters rehearsed the story told
by Blair that a brother had involved
him in financial difficulties and said
that he had called a meeting of Blair's
friends to see if something could not
be done for his relief. Later. accord-
Ing to McPheeters' testimony, a note
given by Blair became due and when a
local bank became insistent and Blair,
had told McPheeters that he could not
raise the fund. McPheeters went to ten
of Blair's friends and secured the mon
ey. $35,000, with which to take up the
note.
David R. Francis, president of tha
Louisiana Purchase Exposition Com
pany, was also a witness. Francis told
of a meeting of the board of directors
of the World's Fair after the publica
tion of the alleged peculations of Blair,
who was at that time general counsel
for the World's Fair Company, at which
it was intimated by one of the directors
that from personal knowledge he knew
tlÂ«at Blair was guilty and that when
Blair heard of the accusation he of
fered to resign, after demanding to
know the name of the man who pro
fessed to know of his guilt.
President Francis said that he re
fused to tell the name to Elair. He
also refused to disclose the Identity of
the director when requested to do so at
the hearing to-day.
GREAT SUM TO BE PAID
OUT AT YEAR'S OPEX1*VCJ
Dividend and Interest Disbursements
Will Exceed All Records by
Three Millions.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â Dividend
and Interest disbursements to be made
in January will break all records, ac
cording to statistics collected by the
Journals of Commerce. The compila
tion indicates a total of about $136,
.600.000 to be paid out by leading: rail:'
road and industrial corporations, local
banks, trust companies, traction com
panies and the National Government.
This, Is nearly $3,000,000 more than in
January a year ago, when the total
payments of similar institutions were
about J133.SOO.000.
The Industrial payments show a
considerable falling: off because of the
reduction and passing of dividends,
but this Is much more than offset by
the* Increased payments on the part
of railroads and local traction com
panies.

NEW YORK, Dec. 23. â Wearing
cartridge belts and with their pockets
filled with dime novels, two boys have

Several pawn tickets were found on
the youths, together with a signed
resolution that they should never part

UNGUARDED BUSINESS MEN.
THE spectacle of the president of the bank of Oberlin, Ohio, a
prisoner, in tears, confessing himself a dupe of Mrs. Chadwick,
had its pitiful features. He is an old man and had achieved an
honorable business career, and hosts of friends made him the keeper
of their money. The temptress came, and he saw a chance to increase
his profits, in what seemed to him a perfectly legitimate way, squar
ing with the approved rules of business and of sound banking.
He loaned the woman money and it was repaid. When she.
came to him with notes aggregating more than a million, signed by
Andrew Carnegie, notes for value received and bearing 5 per cent
interest, and asked that he indorse them, he yielded, and involved
himself and his bank far beyond the capital and credit of both. Yet
the transaction was one common in business. Good paper indorsed
in that way is discounted every day in a majority of the banks of
the country and passes as commercial paper. He intended no wrong,
the motive of a crime was entirely lacking in his act. His incaution
discloses a method by which greater than he may be undone; yet it
discloses no moral turpitude in this man who is its victim.
Say he was a fool if you please. Yet he was duped in a trans
action that occurs commonly in the business of the country. A cus
tomer with whom he had done profitable business, who had met
her paper at maturity, asked of him an ordinary thing in business,
and he granted it, and his trusting friends were robbed and he is
disgraced. Do any men who read this wince as they read? Do they
recall business acts as reckless and foolish as his, of which the
world knows nothing because the harm was not beyond their power
to repair? His case is probably singular only because of the mag
nitude of the amount involved, for there are more unguarded busi
ness men than he. He is pitiful and to be pitied, but he failed as
fiduciary trustee. He will be punished and the woman will prob
ably go free.
There is more than one Andrew Carnegie. Suppose that she
produce an Andrew Carnegie who signed the notes which seem to
have been the basis of her scheme, by what law can she be held ac
countable if her dupes chose to deceive themselves by assuming that
it was Carnegie, the multi-millionaire? Of course the bank president
should have asked why a man of Carnegie's resources was paying 5
per cent interest on notes apparently uttered for money that he had
borrowed. L^se of the telegraph would in an hour have advised him
whether the signature was that of the millionaire. But here was a
woman customer who expressed herself in millions, who had bor
rowed largely and promptly repaid, and it was "business" not to
doubt her word. Again, he should have asked himself and her
why the indorsement of the Oberlin bank was necessary to give
fluency to the commercial paper of the millionaire? But he did
not. He indorsed the notes, stamped them with his credit, and in
law became the. maker of the paper.
In all the long history of Bamboozledom there is no chapter
like this. It outpoints the case of the Humberts in France and far
outclasses the coarse device of a locked up Chinese smuggling fund
that was played in this city to the undoing of a few dupes. . Those
two structures of fraud were jerry-built compared to this. If an
Andrew Carnegie chose to make his notes and the banker 'chose to
indorse them, under the impression that there is only one Andrew
Carnegie, what can be done about it?
The story of this transaction should be posted up in every count
ing-room in the country to teach unguarded bankers and business
men that it is better to lose a customer than to lose a fortune, fame
and freedom. One rule for all securities should validate all, though
the customer fume when his collateral or his paper for indorsement
or discount is put to the test of genuineness. Much, humor is
\yritten about the sweat room of a bank. If it be a chamber of tor
ture to the borrower, it is the ark of tjie covenant for the depositors:
We have much fiction written around the follies of financiers.
These have wrecked banks and every wreck is a tragedy. But fiction
never outdid the realitv of the Chadwick case.
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
IX the Sunday Call Magazine to-morrow "Double Harness," the se
rial by Anthony Hope, which has been appearing for the past six
weeks, will be concluded. On January I will begin "The Breth
ren." a story of the Crusades, by H. Rider Haggard. This is the
latest romance by a writer who is world famous, and marks a new
departure in Mr. Haggard's method. "The Brethren" is a historical
nove^of the modern type, and while it contains little or none of the
weird, of the wildly imaginative and sensational which marked many
of his former works, the writer has lost none of his won
derful power of inciting and sustaining the reader's deepest interest.
< Hher notable books to appear shortly in from two to four install
ments each are "Monsieur Beaucaire,"*Booth'Tarkington's delightful
little pastel ; "A Whirl Asunder," by Gertrude Atherton, and "The
Castaway," the story of Lord Byron, by Hallie Erminie Rives.
Among other features of note to-morrow will be one of Norman
Duncan's virile stories of the fisher folk of the Newfoundland Banks,
"The Raging of the Sea," a simple, straightforward, powerful recitai
of a tragedy in the life of Job Luff. In the "Jottings of Old Lim
Jucklin" Opie Read deals pithily and succinctly with the problem
of marriage. In "On and Off the Bread Wagon" Charles Dryden
lands his hero in Galveston the sole proprietor and owner of $6, car
ries him through a short siege with a street-car gang of laborers,
and winds him up at the end of the chapter with thirty cents of rail
road tickets as his available capital. The $50 prize story for the
week is "Red Head," a tale of the Arizona cattle country, written by
E. Damian Thompson, a woman who has lived among the cowboys
and ridden many a hard day after cattle.

THE COLORADO STUFFERS.
"THE Supreme. Court of Colorado has .found four more election
Y officers guilty of ballot stuffing in the national election and sen
tenced them to terms of imprisonment. This last consignment
of fraudulent election booth custodians to receive punishment at
the hands of the law brings the total of malefactors condemned for
this particular offense up to twenty-three, a satisfying, evidence of
the determination of Colorado's court to keep the ballot in the moun
tain State a clean one.
The especially flagrant violations of the law in the Colorado
election make this quick rounding up of the â¢tuffers all the more
salutary in its significance. Testimony has developed the fact that
in many of Denver's precincts as high as 300 fraudulent votes were
tallied as the result of the stuffing; in every instance some local
politician or pothouse wardster was. at. the bottom of the plot, his
tools being the'typical "repeater" and the convenient forger. When
the first of these ring politicians was brought to bar for his crime
he displayed a superior contempt for the whole proceedings and was
rewarded by the limit of punishment being assigned him by the pre
siding magistrate.
The vigorous measures which have been taken in Colorado to
quelch this form of domineering political corruption must have a
restraining effect upon ballot stuff ers elsewhere, for they but bear
witness to the proverb that all the people can't be hoodwinked all
of the time, and what is true in Colorado is true : in other places.
Flagrant crime against the suffrage, cannot pass unhindered in any
community for long. HHj

And he did not dream why the sud
den, glad light came Into Susan
Strong's eyes.
Two days later Eleanor Carrinsrtbn's
carriage stopped before the humble
Strong cottage. She brought Into the
sick room a new and Invigorating at
mosphere.
"My dear girl, I have never heard of
your illness. We have lived almost
constantly In the country of late â and
I seldom see your brother. Why didn't
you let me know? I should have been
so glad to come. And now you send
for me that you may help me In my
work. You make me feel so â so sel
fish."
Her rich fur* dropped from her
shoulders, and the tall statuesque
young woman fell to her knees beside
the little Invalid with her delicate,
pathetic face, big, wistful eyes and
short, curling hair.
"Oh, you mustn't feel that way," said
the girl, as she stroked the fur with her
wasted hand. "Ned has taken such
good care of me, and Iâ well, I Just
need something to occupy my mind.
Did you bring the dolls?"
"Dolls? Dozens of them!" said Miss
Carrington, with a happy catch in her
voice. "But you must let me cut out
the clothes. It is enough for you to
sew."
This was the beginning of happy days
for Susan j) Strong. " Hardly an after
noon passed without a call from Elea
nor, who wanted to see how the gay
ladies from Paris. Berlin, Switzerland,
Japan and. Russia were coming on.
Sometimes she laid aside her wraps
and sewed with the invalid. During
these hours Susan learned many things
not^only of the hospital work, but of
Eleanor's life at home and in the social
world. And .. best of all, she learned
that the rumors regarding the beauti
ful girl's engagement to Senator Elkua
were. without foundation. â¢

Eleanor Carrington looked past the
Invalid through the window, into the
clear winter sunlight as if seeing a far
away picture.
"I do not think there Is any danger
of my seeing your brother."
; But she was wrong. She saw him
the very next day when he came home
earlier than usual. She had brought
some holly to deck Susan's room, for
Christmas- waa drawing near. And ahe
had brought a beautifully embroidered
dressing aacque for the Invalid also.
Susan was tying the bow at the throat
of her dainty gift and surveying her
eelf In a small mirror. Eleanor waa
hanging a holly wreath above the
dressing table, when she swung 'round
suddenly, the gay wreath rolling to the
floor. In the mirror she had caught
sight of Ned Strong's amazed face. He
was standing In the doorway.
"Oh, Ned. why did you come too
soon?" cried Susan in mock dismay In
reality her heart /was Binging with very
Joy. >
"Eleanor," said the man- without
moving from the doorway.
She stooped to pick up the wreath,
and when she stood up once more her
color had come back and her compo
sure was perfect.
We were Just fixing a little sur
prise for you," she said, offering her
hand and meeting his glance squarely.
But I don't think you deserve it You
haven t played fair. Ned." His glance
wavered from her face to the Invalids
couch. Susan was bending over, tying
a refractory bow in a 'doll's hat. Elea
nor went on quietly.
"You might at least have told me
whyâ"
*** couldn't" His voice was very low.
I did not dare ask you to wait."
She drew her breath sharply. "And
yet you must have known."
A minute later Ned Strong bent over
his sister's couch. The refractory bow
had come to time. She looked up Into
his face with shining eyes.

Experienced With Road Across

CHICAGO, Dec. 28 The report that
the Union Pacific Railway Company
was experiencing great difficulty -with
the Lucin cut-off of that road over
the Great Salt Lake in Utah was em
phatically denied here to-night by
Julius Kruttschnltt, director of main
tenance ' and operation of tha Harri

"There has been no serious einklnf
recently of the grade on the Lucin cut
off except the usual subsidence of any
newly constructed line," said Krutt
schnitt. "The bank at Rambo and
everywhere else in the Great Salt Lake
Is up to grade and we are shipping
away tools and outfits as fast as we
can, reserving only enough in case of
further sinks. We had some ordinary
settlements this week, but not enough
to delay trains except on December 20,
when there was a delay of forty min
utes to one of our passenger trains."

MANY CONTESTS
Players in This Vicinity
Will Be Active on the
Links During Holidays
LADIES AT PRESIDIO
First Competition of This
Season for the Council's
Cup on Tuesday Morning
If the present programme is carried
out the golfers of San Francisco and
neighborhood will be busy until after
SCew Tear's day. There will b* play on
the links every day from to-day until
i he 2d of January, inclusive. On Mon
ilay, the 2Cth inst., there will be a handi
cap over eighteen holes on the Presidio

Francisco Golf and Country Club. On
the same day the members of the San
Rafael Golf Club will take part in a
handicap over eighteen holes on the
Happy Valley course for a cup pre
sented by A. S. Lllley.
Though no contests have been defi
nitely arranged to tjjke place on the
course of the Claremont Country Club,
several players will be out for practice,
and a contest of some sort is likely to
bÂ» held. The Claremont members are
much pleased with the cÂ«w course,
which is interesting and not too diffi
cult. The club, with its handsome,
well -equipped clubhouse, fine bowling
green and lawn tennis courts, its
i oque court, garden, stables, golf
course and trap-shooting ground, its
excellent location and thÂ« fine view it
affords, has been pronounced by men
-.vhc are familiar with country clubs
Sn many parts of the United States as
superior to any similar institution in
the Western States and equal to any
in the land.
On Tuesday, the 27th inst.. the la
dies of the San Francisco Golf and
Country Club will hold the qualifying
round over eighteen holes, medal play,
of the first competition during the
present season for the Council's cup
for women. On Wednesday morning
the eiffht ladies who qualify will take
part in the first round at match play.
On Thursday morning the four win-'
ners of the first round of matches will
play in the semi-final round. On
Friday morning the two winners in
the second round will play in the
final round, the winner in which will
have her name, with the date, en
graved on the handsome silver trophy.
Piay on each day will begin at 9:30
a. m. promptly.
New Year's day is, always a busy
one among the men of thÂ« San Fran
cisco Golf Club. The New Year's day
handicap over eighteen holes gener
ally brings out more than a score of
competitors, prizes being offered for
the bent gross and the best net score.
The annual competition for the Liv
erpool cold medal is also held on New
Year's day, the winner becoming the
medal play champion of the club for
the year. The gold medal is at pres
ent held by H. C. Golcher, who won
It on January 1 of this year with a
ecore of 29, 46. total 85, J. W. Byrne
being the closest possible second with
46. 40. total 8 6. The upual competi
tion for the. srpld medal and the han
dicap will no doubt take place on
January 2. 1905.
Arrangements will soon be made for
a home-and-home team match be
tween representatives of the Clare
mont Country Club and the San Ra
fael Golf. Club. .

Junior Club at Golden Gate
Park Proves a Marked
Success in Brief Time
GOOD TRAINING SCHOOL
Some Future Champion Is
Expected to Spring From
Banks of Organization
There will be but one Christmas
tournament on the tennis courts and
that will be a scratch doubles held by
the California Club. The Golden Gate
Club has given up tournament play
for the present and has nothing sched
uled until the latter part of January.
In the meantime the boys of the
Junior Club and the ladies of the
Annex are taking advantage of the
respite and are holding tournaments
regularly.
The Junior Club, which was organ
ized by Mr. Marvin about two months
ago, has grown with surprising rapid
ity. The club started with about
twenty members and already has some
sixty on the roll. The boys average
almost two tournaments a week, in
which the entry list is always large
and the interest at a high pitch. A
continuous tournament was started
last week and as the boys will be able
to play after school hours it should
prove a great success.'
This club will prove an excellent
training school and will develop
many good players. It is restricted to
boys 16 years of age or under. The
dues and initiation fee are small and
any boy within the age limit can be
come a member.
The Christmas tournament, which
the California Club is planning, will
be an interesting affair. It will be a
scratch doubles in which partners are
drawn. This will make the affair
something of a lottery. If the best
player Jn the club draws a fourth
class man the team will stand abso
lutely no show to win. I- neeras hard
ly just to the better players, who have
been asked to- give handicaps In all
the tournaments of late. A straight
scratch doubles would be more satis
factory and would > be working no
hardship on the poorer players.
When the Whitneys \.ere the club
champions an occasional handicap
even; was always frowned upon. In
those days the men" who were learn
ing the game considered themselves
fortunate if they could get one handi
cap tournament out of three. Now
the cracks consider themselves lucky
if one tournament in five is a scratch
event.
The New Tear's tournament, which
will not be interfered with by the
Christmas event in case of rain, will
be the annual class singles tourna
ment. It will determine who is the
best man in each -class. Every active
member of the club will participate
in this event, which is one of the most
important. of the year. It will also
determine V^ho. the club's best man is.
J. D. MacGavin's departure leaves this
question open, r The winner of the
first class â  will be the club champion
for the year.
The continuous tournament,, which
was started about three weeks ago,
has not been as successful as was ex
pected....This, however, is not due to
a- lack of interest, but ' is due - to
weather conditions. The board is full
of challenges at .all times . and , the
players seem anxious to. get -at one
another. A mistake; was made:: in
starting an event' of this kind in mid
winter. Most of the players cannot
get out -during the week and- the at
tendance is so large on Saturday after
noons that the "courts are given over
entirely to doubles. This leaves Sun
day the onlyl day on which most of the
members can play. In case of a rainy
Sunday or an' enforced absence from
the city the matches drag along. The
days are too short for, a . continuous
tourney. v An event of this kind in the
spring or early fall . would . prove a
great success, but, in* mid-summer, or
winter It. is a difficult thing, to ( hold.
The players, are;. taking more interest
in this , tournament, than any similar
one held in the past. .

DRIVE BALL WITH HEAD AND FEET
Association Football League Includes Seven
' Clubs and Gains Favor of the Public.
No matches . for the 1904-1905 cham
pionship of the California Association
Football League will be played either
to-morrow or on Monday, but four
practice games will be played by
league teams during the holidays. At
Freeman's Park to-morrow the Occi
dentals will line up for a friendly con
test with the Albion Rovers, the ball
being kicked off at 2:30 p. m. At Idora
Park, beginning at the same time to
morrow, the Oakland Hornets will play
against the Independents.
On Monday, the Occidental eleven
will engage in an association football
match against the Wolf Tones, play
beginning at 2:30 p. m. on the ground
at Ninth and Bryant streets, San Fran
cisco. The Wolf Tones are champions
of Gaelic football, having defeated the
Parnells 4 goals to 3 in a match played
a few weeks ago. On" the same day,
beginning at the same hour, the Vam
pires will â¢ play the regular annual
match against a team of the Seamen's
Institute, San Francisco, on the cricket
ground at Alameda.
The Albion Rover*, having played
more matches and won a greater num
ber than any other team, stand at the
head of the championship table. The
Independents, however, drew the bye
last Sunday and so had no opportunity
to add to their list of victories. The
Independents are in a better position
with regard to the ultimate result than
the Rovers, for they have, lost only
one match out of six, whereas the
Rovers have lost two matches out of
eight, or in the proportion of one in
four. It is probable that the Oakland
Hornets will become a more important
element in the contests that " will be
played next year. The results of the
league matches up to date are shown

Storm Will Have Tendency
to Scatter the v Ducks
and Spoil Holiday Sport
The duck shooters are in a quandary
as . to the quality of the sport which
awaits them to-morrow morning on the
marshes. The rain of Thursday night
is expected to have some Â»effect on the
shooting, but how much cannot be de
termined until the fun commences.
Some of the men who were out last
Sunday had a peculiar experience. The
fog was so thick on some of the pre
serves that the birds could be heard
dropping into the ponds and slough3
among the decoys and yet could not
be seen. The birds were moving about
in great numbers. The members of the
Empire Gun Club found the shooting
over their ponds- good, but the fog hung
over the slough and spoiled the sport
there. ' ' l,\ â¢'
The members of the Miramonte
Club at Burdells had excellent shoot-
Ing last Sundav. Ed Donohoe was a
guest of the members and secured 42

Charles Lains killed 40 birds, the ma
jority of which were cans. Clarence
Neuman was the only other member
out. . " .
The San Pablo shore furnished ideal
canvasback shooting last Sunday. Nine
men secured limit bags easily. .Henry
Klevesahl and Dr. Hutton secured a
joint bag of- 40 cans near Giant. 'Jack
Moi sen picked' up 17 cans in the same
neighborhood. The birds killed in this
district were as fat as butter, while
those secured near Petaluma were thin.
It is supposed the former are living high
on the -baited preserves, while
the, latter have to scratch around after

LEASHMEN LOOK
TO INAUGURAL
Fleetest Hounds in Train
ing Will Start on New
Year's Day at. Union Park
The management of Union Cours
ing Park has announced the annual
renewal of the Inaugural champion
stake, which will be run on New
Year's day. The entrance fee will be
$10 and there will be liberal added
money. Among the fast dogs which
are expected to start are: Richard
Anton. McVey. Barge, Belle Free.
Friendless Boy and .others.
On Monday, January 2, fi special
holiday stake will be run in its en
tirety. :'r: %
Pocatelli, the champion greyhound,
is in training and will sooi\ be seen in
the running. The hares are excep
tionally strong for this season of the
year and the dogs require severe work
to fit them for competition.
P. J. Reilly has registered a litter
of seven puppies by McVey-Rosie
Clair. The latter is one of the famous
St. Clairs and much is expected of the
youngsters.
There will be no coursing at Union
Park to-morrow, . but a special holi
day stake of forty-eight entries will
be run on Monday. The first brace of
dogs will be sent to the slips upon the
arrival of the 10:15 a. m. train. The
officials endeavored to secure grey
hounds of the same class and they
succeeded. No one entry stands out
above the others, so there will be
some lively speculation as to the ulti
mate winner. The likely winners in
the first round look to be:
Aeolus, Mlsa Green, Runaway Actress Rapid

Lovers of the Field Dog
Throughout the Coast
Will Be on the Ground
The annual meet of the Pacific Coast
Field Trials Club at Bakersfleld com
mencing January 9 gives early prom-
lse of being the most successful ever
held on the coast. Birds are plenti
ful on the carefully preserves grounds
over which the sporty a-rtters and
pointers will work. The** are a large
number of high class field dugs in
training and an unusually large num
ber of well known sportsmen have sig
nified their intention of being present.
Chief interest centers In the Pacific
Coast champion stake, entries for which
will close uoon the completion of the
all-age event. Any setter or pointed
having won a first, second or third
in a recognized field trial will be eligi
ble. This will be the first running of
the champion event since 1901 at Cor
onado. At that time there was only
two starters. Six or more are expected
at the forthcoming trials.
The champion stake tests the con
dition, stamina and bird finding quali
ties of the dogs. While they are do-=ni
for only half-hour heats for the first
time in the other events, here they
are down two hours, making a trying
ordeal. The prize Is a valuable cup.
which must be won twice to become
the property of the winner.
Among the well known sportsmen
who will attend the trials are: Presi
dent W. W. Van Arsdale. Secretary
Albert Betz. W. S. Tevis. Frank Mas

HONITON HANDLES WEIGHT
AND TAKES THE HANDICAP
Magrane Runs Sec
ond, a Nose in
Front of Judge.
DR. LEGGO WINS
Nigrette Loses Her
Company in the
Last Race.
DORA I IN FRONT
BY FRED E- MTTLHOLXiAND.
That a good horse can carry weight
end dispose of ordinary ones received
exemplification at Oakland yesterday
when P. Ryan's sweet mare Honiton
picked up IIS pounds and Etrolled in
first for the handicap, decided at seven
furlongs.
On paper, the chances of tome of the
lightweights of the party stood out like
& full-dress suit at a Tehama-etreet
lawn party, but faded away when It
came down to actual racing. Magrane,
a 95-pounder, received some smart
backing, and while the three-year-old
finished second, he had no more chance
cf beating the daughter of Ormonde
than a Chinese laundryman in a glass
bottomed boat would have of safely
passing through the Niagara â whirlpool
rapids, and his price would be 8S to 1.
Still the admirers of Magrane, Judge,
Romaine and Matt Hogan enabled the
followers of Honiton to get as good as
2 to 1 about him, although 7 to 5
was the market price.
DAVIS PILOTS HOXITOX.
Davis had the leg up on the favorite,
and he had orders to wait for nothing
but his jockey fee after the race. At
ihe head of the stretch the plebeian
members of the company had all re
ceived theirs, and Honiton finished the
remainder of the route at her leisure.
Che won by two lengths In 1:27%.
which is a remarkably good perform
ar.ee over a sloppy course. Sam Green
â¢field kept Magrane hard at work, with
a result that he nosed Judge out for
the place.
â¢ Another large crowd viewed the rac
lns, despite the thieatening condition
of the weather. The betting was all
that could be desired. Favorites won
three races. -r"t :â <
â¢ Perhaps the longest price laid about
a winner, all things considered, was
the 11 to 10 chalked apainst Nigrette,
winner nf the last race cf the day, over
one mile and seventy yards. A little
slop oa the surface of the track ap
pears to intensify the mare's speed,
and afw indulging Red Cross Nurse
â with the lead to the far turn she picked
up the running.
NIGRfTTTE AX EASY WINNER.
Travers had apparently made up his
mind to take no chances of losing, but
allowed the favorite to sift along,
breezir.p home ten lengths before Leila,
the second choice. Red Cross Nurse
secured the show frnm Harka, the only
other Ftarter. by nearly half a block.
Velna, with Sam Greenfield up, went
to the poet a flight favorite over Handy
Bill and Edgecliff. for the Futurity
rjirint. first decided. The Rubicon filly
f.Iled third poFitiim until well into the
Ftretch, when she dropped back and
.ran unplaced. McBride 'on Edgecliff
caught Salable, the pacemaker, the last
f*w yards, winning by less than .a
length. Kandy Bill drcpped'in an in
different third.
At no period of his racing career did
Bell Reed fancy six furlongs, and he
finished third for the six-furlong sell
ing: affair, after ruling: a pronounced
choice. Albemarle, the second choice,
piloted by Sam Greenfield, took the
lead from the favorite when ready and
in a mi!d drive led Lady Kent out a
couple of lengths. Hipponax lost the
show to the first choice by a nose.
I>R. LEGGO BEATS SEA AIH.
While Sea Air held the balance of the
Etarters in the six-furlong purse event
safe. Dr. Legrco proved too much for
the filly. Quoted at 7 to 10 and ridden
by Banner, the doctor after a some
what stormy passage, defeated Sea Air
by a length. Smithy Kane tincanned
out in front for half a miie. then he
slunk away to the rear. A. Muskoday
ran third at 20 to L
WalJy Brinkworth and his friends un
lozded on The Cure to win the mile
selling fixture and Dora I, a 30 to 1
*hot. dropped in unexpectedly. The
outsider had McBride in the saddle and
led from Ftart to finish. The Cure in a
h2rd drive sot up in time to down The
Lieutenant a neck for p!ace honors.
The Fretter. at cne time favorite in the
betting, ran a poor race.
TRACK XOTES.
McBride piloted two winners, Edge
cliff and Dora I, besides finishing, sec
ond on Lacy Kent and Sea Air. His
record was marred by a piece of rough
riflinp on Sea Air that caused the
Judges to set the capable young rider
down for a week. It looked as if Mc-
Bride wtnt out of his v.ay on two or
thret* occasions to foul Bonner on Dr.
Lefrpo. and it f-urprised nobody that
the Judges took action.
Para Greenfield rode one winner and
finished second astride Magrane, The
Cure and Leila.
Pearl Waters received support on the
strength of a fast five-furlong work-
F. A. Meyers, an Eastern turfman,
owner of Gay Boy and other prominent
performers, is here.

Sail Francisco Club 3Iatck
Mater Finds Difficulty
in Getting Strong Card
Matchmaker Alex Greggains of the
San Francisco Athletic Club is finding
it difficult to find a card for next month
-.vhich will have the drawing power of
some of the recen^ fights held here.
Battling Nelson would give him no
decided answer yesterday, saying he
could not talk business until he had
straightened out his differences with
Manager Murphy. The latter will be
brought back from Stockton to-day by
the police and an effort win be made to
straighten out the tangle inÂ£o which
their accounts have been twisted.. -
If Nelson cannot talk business within
the next twenty-four hours with Greg
grains the latter will look at once for
another match. He has in view matches
between Jack Johnson and Marvin
Kart. Jack Root and Hart and Jimmy
Gardner and Buddy Ryan. The ob
jection to 'two of these matches is that
the principals are strangers here and
outsiders seldom draw well.
-There are few sensational matches in
view, the old material having been
worked over so often as to have palled
or. the public taste. Jabez White, the
Knglish champion. Is anxious for a
match 'with Britt. The latter does not
want to talk fight until after the holi
days.
There are no rising young borers in
bight of championship material. "
Manager Al Murphy of, the Lincoln
Athletic Club has completed the card
for the boxing show to be given In Me
chanics' Pavilion next Friday night.
There ' will be seven bouts of four
rounds' duration. Billy Roach has been
selected referee. The best contest will
be a four- round go between Sam Ber
ger of the Olympic Club and Jim
Casey, the husky longshoreman who
has been fighting under the name of
â¢'Toung Fitzsimmons." Berger is train
ing at Sheehan's, Ocean Beaeh: Casey
is preparing at the Hayes Valley Ath

bantam champion of the world,

READY TO FACE
THEIR ACCUSERS
Senator Mitchell and Con
gressman Hermann Arrive
in Portland From Capital
PORTLAND, Dec. 23.â Senator John
H. Mitchell and - Congressman ' Her
mann arrived in this city to-night from
Washington, D. C, to deny by their
presence and by their testimony, if per
mitted to do so, the charges made In
cretain quarters connecting them with
the land frauds in this State which are
being investigated by secret agents, of
the Government at the behest of Presi
dent Roosevelt.
Prosecuting Attorney Henev. for the
Government, requested the attendance
of Mitchell "and Hermann during the
trial which, was concluded two weeks
ago, but owing to the pressure of im
portant â  Congressional business in
affecting the State of Ore
gon neither could respond to the sum
mons.
As soon as . possible, and with the
Christmas adjournment of Congress
close at hand, Mitchell and Hermann
boarded the train for this city. It Is
their desire to be permitted to appear
before the Federal Grand Jury which
is in session here and to explain vari
ous phases of land transactions In
which they are involved.
Neither Mitchell nor Hermann would
make a statement to-night except to
deny any wrong-doing. They do not
seem to know the exact nature of the
charges against them.
* The Federal Grand Jury apparently
had a quiet day, but it is generally ex
pected that indictments will be return
ed to-morrow before the jury adjourns
over the Christmas holidays. A num
ber of witnesses were called to : day. It
is expected that the Mitchell and Her
mann phase of the investigation will
be taken up early next week, so that
the two men can return to Washington.
SAY OFFICIAL BONDS
HAVE SOME TIME TO RUN
Works Commissioners Will Furnish
New Sureties if the Company
May Iiegally Withdraw.
Commissioners Sqhmitz and Maes
tretti of the P.ublic Works Depart
ment are not worrying about the no
tice filed by the Fidelity Company
that it desires to withdraw from the
bonds of the two city officials.
Schmitz is of the opinion that the
company cannot withdraw as sure
ties in. view of the fact that his prem
ium Is paid up to April 8 next, while
that of Maestretti does not expire un
til July's. 1905.
On the other hand,. Auditor Baehr
discovered that sections 972; to 975 of
the Political Code provide that sure
ties may withdraw from official bonds
upon giving due notice to the official
insured and to tbe Auditor and Mayor
that it desires to do soJ â  The sections
also provide that unless new bonds*
are furnished by the officials -within
ten days their offices become vacant.
In this case if the offices became va
cant Mayor Schmitz would reappolnt
the' two Commissioners.
"Idofnot think that our offices will
become vacant." said Commissioner
Schmitz. "If the law plainly holds
that a surety company may withdraw
from bonds at will, then Â»e propose
to furnish new bonds. I do not believe
that such is the case. Our prem
iums have. some time to run yet and
I am of the opinion that the com
pany, having, made a contract for a
stated period must fulfill it for the
time designated." I;cannot blame the
company" for -wishing to withdraw in
view of the Superior Court decision
that we are individually responsible
on -our bonds "for. damages arising
from defective ; sidewalks and streets,
for which" the 1 city alone should be re
sponsible."

TO CIRCUMVENT
EXCLUSION LAW
Plan on Foot to Take the
Chinese to England and
Then Get Them to America
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.âInforma
tion has reached the Immigration au
thorities of a scheme, by which it is
proposed to bring Into this country
Chinese, who in the regular order of
events might be refused admission. The
proposition is to take the Chinese from
China to Liverpool and then ticket
them through to New York viajlalifax
or St. John and Rouses Point
The particular desire of the promoters
of the plan is to have the Chinese en
ter this country through Rouses Point,
which is on the Canadian line near the
border of New York and Vermont.. At
Rouses Point no detention house of the
immigration service Is located and the
Chinese entering the country there
would not be subject to the investiga
tion of a regular board of immigration
inspectors. They would be detained,
however, by United States marshals,
but this proceeding would bring the
cases, in due course, before United"
States Commissioners.
Each Chinese would be provided with
papers indicating that he was a resi
dent of this, country and had a right
therefore to return to it. Such papers,
the immigration people assert, are not
difficult to obtain. The same scheme
was worked successfully several years
ago along the Canadian border until
broken up by the establishment of de
tention houses where the applicants
were held pending a rigid inquiry into
the nature of the evidence- they sub
mitted. This plan will be followed at
Rouses Point.
WEATHER IS UNSETTLED
ALL ALONG THE COAST
Professor MeAdie Says Showers 3Iay
Be San Franci*ico"s Portion on
Christmas Day.
The weather was unsettled yester
day all along the Pacific Coast from
Sari Diego to Vancouver. The rain
fall was light in California and Tieavy
in Utah "and Southern Idaho. Much
snow fell in the Sierras.
In this State there were two storms,
ene north of the Tehachapi and the
other south. The precipitation in
San Diego was 1.50 iryhes, while In
San Francisco the i-egistered rainfall
was .46 of an inchf The winds were
light from the southwest. Professor
McAdie says the weather will proba
bly remain unsettled for several days.
It may be clear Sunday and Monday,
but the indications last night favored
showers.
While the rains are causing some
inconvenience to shoppers, general
benefits will be derived from plenty of
moisture. Every shower is welcomed
in the agricultural districts and much
more water must be stored in the
mountains to save, San Franciscans
from being compelled to drink from
the. bay next summer. "Â£*

TAYLOR FINDS
NELSON'S COIN
Local Detective Discovers
Draft in the Pocket of
Battling's Boy 3Ianager
WILL BE BEOUGHT BACK
Murphy and Santry Will
Be Returned on Charge
of Felony Embezzlement
The mutual bank roll of Battling
Nelson and Ted Francis Murphy haa
been discovered. Detective Taylor,
who went to Stockton -to bring back
Murphy and Eddie Santry on a chargo
of felony embezzlement, found a
draft for $9001 in the boy manager's
hip pocket." Murphy maintains that
he has the right to hold the draft un
til a settlement la made. ITJV
:/â  The flitting of the boy manager and
Santry was a.. ruse to get the Dane away
from certain temptations in this city.
â¢It is said that Battling is tired of be
ing a good boy and staying home nights.
.He has developed an ambition to hit
the high places In benzine buggies and
to 'do other stunts that undo prize
fighters, - - . " '
--There Is another reason why Mur
pby'wants the Dane' to leave San
Francisco. < Several rivals for the posi
tion of to Battling are In thÂ»
field. and Nelson seems, not averse to
a change*. Billy Pierce of Boston and
Eilly Benner of- Chicago would like to
he the for the little fighter,
who bids 'fair. to. coin money at the
game for some* time to come. Nelson
is sa'fd tofarvor'Benner.
- Murphy; -who. managed Nelson in
the days when coffee and sinkers threo
times a day constituted luxury, has no
intention of being thrown down with
out making an outcry. Several days
ago he .asked Nelson to sign a con
tract granting the manager 35 per
cent of the earnings. "Nix." retorted
the Dane. â¢"You didn't want a con-
Iract when I was a tramp." It was
whispered to Murphy that Battling,
acting under the influence of a certain
woman, intended to cancel their af
filiations.
The scheme to get Nelson away
from these evil influences failed. Bat
timer secured a warrant from Judge
Cabaniss for the arrest of the boy
manager and Eddie Santry on a chargo
of felony embezzlement. Detectiva
Taylor was detailed to bring the pair
back to this city.
Immediately on his arrival at Stock
ton Taylor searched the . prisoners.
Snugly. tucked in Murphy's hip pocket
was the draft for $9001 on Chicago.
The Stockton police had searched the
prisoners before, but found only $250.
Murphy says Santry had nothing to
do with taking the money. The_boy
manager says he has a perfect right
to hold the coin. He maintains that
he- did not Intend to rob Nelson. Ha
only wanted to get him away from San
Francisco.
As Nelson intends to lose Murphy,
and Murphy does not intend to be losr,
there will probably be a civil suit over
the money. Local sporting men think
that Battling is not acting fairly In at
tf mpting to throw Murphy down. San
try and the boy manager will be
brought back to-day.

taSRREROS CROSSING INTO
BRITISH BECHUANALiAND
BERLIN. Dec 23.â The German Con
sul General at Cape Town announces
that, according to official British dis
patches, the Herrero chief Samuel Ma
herero has crossed the frontier into
British Bechuanaland and, asked per
mission of the authorities to remain
permanently. . The British magistrate
in Ngamiland has received orders to
prevent the Herreros so far as possible
from entering British territory, but
those entering must be immediately
disarmed and prevented from return
ing to German Southwest Africa, and
the German officials must be permitted
to come into the colony and examine
the cattle of the refugee* Herreroa to
determine whether they are stolen. The
magistrate has also been informed that
Samuel Maherero, with a limited num
ber of followers, might remain, but that
they must settle at a considerable dis
tance from the German frontier. Sam
uel is the principal insurgent chief.
Xot Satisfactory.
The crew of a freight train side
tracked near Norristown to await the
passage of four trains fell asleep from
weariness produced by being twenty
two hours on duty, awoke and ran*
out to the main track, thinking the
other trains had passed. A wreck re
sulted, two persons were killed and
the Coroner's jury held the crew for
criminal negligence. Judge Swartz of
the Montgomery County Court held
that no man was compelled to work
under such conditions, that he ought
to have quit work when he found him
self reaching his physical limit,' even
at the risk of losing his job, rather
than Jeopardize the lives of others.
This ruling will be accepted as com
mon sense and good law. But the
question remains, What is the remedy
for such conditions? Putting it up to
the train crew is not the most satis
factory solution. Railroads should
not ask, should not permit, their em
ployes to work under such. conditions,
which jeopardize the lives of passen
gers. The increasing frequency, of
wrecks caused by worn-out employes
falling asleep or making mistakes de
mands that railroad management
should do something to provide a rem
edy. â Pittsburg Dispatch.

Synopsis of Eeport of Ex

Is Given Out at the Capital
$23,766,022 JS EEQUIEED
Engineers Decide That the
Levee System Is Best for
the Sacramento Lowlands
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 23.â The fol
lowing Is issued by Commissioner of
Public Works Frank D. Ryan, as a
synopsis of the report now in the hands
of the Governor, of the commission of
engineers recently appointed to inves
tigate conditions and report a plan for
the improvement of the San Joaquin
and Sacramento rivers and their tribu
taries. The report Is dated Sioux City,
Iowa, December 15, and was received at
Sacramento December 22, 1904:
The general plan recommended by
the commission of engineers consists in
ultimately concentrating the flow of
the Sacramento , River into one main
channel, controlled by large levees at
a distance of from 1000 to 1600 . feet
apart and extending from Chico Land
ing down to Collinsville, with tempo
rary by-passes on the east and west, to
be used as overflow canals until such
time as the main channel shall be en
abled to carry all flood waters. These
canals to be used thereafter as drain
age canals for the various basins.
For the general -consideration of the
matter the engineers have divided the
river into divisions. .:'"â¢-;
It is proposed to close various chan
nels when the main channel has been
enlarged sufficiently to carry all the
waters. The channels thus affected
are Sutter Slough, Merritt Slough,
Georgiana Slough, Three-Mile Slough
and Butte Slough. V
The commission, has not considered
in detail the needs of the San Joa
quin, believing that the work proposed
for the Sacramento River will accom
plish all that is needed to remove the
difficulties threatening the San Joa
quin. -' :'
The report goes on to state that
"while % much, damage has been done
the rivers as the result of hydraulic
mining, yet It should be recognized
that these river channels were not
capable of carrying all of the water
of their great floods during t>e period
that antedated the era of hydraulic
mining, so t"hat the latter is not wholly
responsible for the evils of overflow,
though the difficulty of dealing with
the problem has been much emphas
ized by this agency." ': %
The report further states that "all
parts of the Sacramento flood plane
are so connected with one another that
they cannot be considered as independ
ent units in any scheme of reclamation,
but must rather be treated as a whole.
Each portion of the territory should
therefore be included in the general
scheme and all reclamation work with
in its limits should be in conformity
v.-ith the broad plan embracing the en
tire valley. The entire funds for the
work should be guaranteed : from the
start. In the plan of operations em
braced in the report there. is no reason
for giving precedence iii time to any
part of the work recommended over the
other parts, but the work may and
should be prosecuted in all parts of the
field simultaneously."
The cost estimated in the report is
as follows: â¢*>â  . : . â  - 7;
"Levee construction, $6,833,650; chan
nel development, $7,269,730; west side

WE SHOULD NEVER V
SHOW OUR' EMOTION
Instances Evidencing the Undemon
strative Nature of the
English.
We Anglo-Saxons ; are apt to pride
ourselves upon "being undemonstrative.
Max Adler tells a tale of a boy who
was sent out by his father to fetch in
some wood. The boy took the opportu
nity of disappearing and did not show
his face again beneath the paternal
roof for more than twenty years. Then
one evening a smiling, well-dressed
stranger entered to the old couple and
ajtffaounced himself as their long-lost
child.
"Well, you haven't hurried yourself,"
grumbled the old man, "and blarm me
if now you haven't forgotten ' the
wood."
I was lunching with an Englishman
in a London restaurant one day. ; A
man entered and took a seat at a table
near by, and, glancing round and meet
ing my friend's eye, smiled and nodded.
"Excuse me a ' minute," .said my
friend, "I must just speak to my
brother, haven't seen him for over, five
years." k
He finished his soup and leisurely
wiped his mustache before strolling
across and shaking hands. They talked
for a while, then my. friend returned to
me.
"Never thought to 'see him again."
observed my friend; "he was one of the
garrison at that place in Africaâ
what's the namo of it?â that the Mahdi
attacked. Only : three of them escaped.
Always was a lucky beggar, Jim."
"But wouldn't you like to talk to him
some more?".. I suggested. 1 "I can see
you any time about this little business
of, ours."
"Oh, that's all right." he . answered ;
"we have just flxed-it upâ shall be din
ing \yith him to-morrow." â London - M.

SAMAR THICK
WITH BANDITS
Governor Wright Tells of
the Eaids Made by Hill
Savages of the Island
PURSUED BY TROOPS
Indications That It Will
Take Several Years to Put
a Stop to the Outrages
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â Secretary
Taft this afternoon made public a mall
report Just received from Governor
Wright in regard to the condition of
affairs in Samar and other Islands of
the Philippine group. It is in part as
follows: \
The great bulk of the civilized Filipinos iirÂ»
en or not remote from the coast line, but ther*
are scattered communities living in the moun
tains who are little removed from savagery.
It frequently happens that some enterprising
man among them will obtain a considerable
following and will perpetrate all sorts of out
rages upon peaceful and Inoffensive inhab
itants. This cannot be changed at once. It
therefore may be Inferred that for several
vears to come there will be eruptions from this
source and that they will make raids upon the
civilized Filipinos living In/ the lowland* as
heretofore. The commission, so far . as Its
finances permit. Is engaged in building roads
to open up these remote sections of the In
terior and to make them accessible.
A striking Instance of the tendencies of these
mountaineers Is furnished by . recent occur
rences in the island of Samar. Two months
ago several hundred of these hillmen. under
the leadership of one of their number, who
styles himself Papa . ( Pope) Bulan. and who.
as is usually the case, claims to. be divinely
inspired, suddenly descended upon the native
towns along the coant line, plundered and
burned the outlying barrios and began killing
men, women and children indiscriminately.
The constabulary promptly took the field
against them and they were soon broken up
into email bands and are now being pursued
and killed or captured.
Captured members of the band state that
tha immediate cause of the outbreak was that
certain of their countrymen, who were promi
nent in the insurrection and who have been
employed by mercantile houses as agents for
the purchase of hemp, had oppressed them by
paying them only a nominal price for their
hemp, thereafter turning it In to their prin
cipals at a much larger price.
The Spaniards Impressed themselves less,
perhaps, upon the people of Samar than upon
the inhabitants of the other islands except
Mindanao, the home of the Moros. There Is
therefore more combustible material there than
In the other. Islands.
GEYSERS THAT RIVAL
THOSE OF YELLOWSTONE
Yellowstone Park is reputed to have
the most magnificent geysers in the
world, but their reputation .is based
upon the statements of travelers who
have never been to New Zealond and
who know nothing of its natural won
ders.
I Leaving Auckland by a fast express
train a journey of eight hours brings
one to Rotorua, where may be seen
the most splendid geyser which i3
possible to be found anywhere in
the world. To give some idea of the
magnitude of the geyser one need
mention only the height of some of
the surrounding objects. Over the
"Inferno crater," which contains a
seething lake of water. Is a small
shelter shed 450 feet above the plain.
The surface of the water In the geyser
basin when at rest is about forty feet
below this plain. The height of the
eruption must often be about 900 feet.
This is by no means exceptional.
Higher "shots" have been recorded.
Some months ago the area of the basin
was measured in a small boat bv a
traveler and a guide. They found that
the area is about two and a half acres,
from which it mav be inferred that
this geyser 'may well be called the
largest in "the world.
The geyser plays about twenty-two
times a month, is very erratic and
gives no warning when it is about to
erupt. The theory is advanced that
the basin is somewhat like a funnel
and that when the water and stones
are ejected the larger stones return
and jam in' the neck, thereby choking
the outlet, so that an enormous pres
sure of steam must shift them. When
the pressure is sufficiently great to
blow out the obstructions It naturally
wouldeject water to a great height.
This geyser is not the only- one to
be seen In this vicinity. Others may
be N mentioned, such as the| Pohutu,
Walroa, Feather, Papakura and
others, besides mud volcanoesâChi
cago Chronicle.
Historic Ships' Names.
At least four historic ships of our
navy have been launched from Boston
ways â the Constitution, the old Cum
berland, the Hartford and the Merrl
mac. The old Cumberland, the ship
of tragic glory, was .launched more
than sixty years ago. The Merrlmac,
converted into a Confederate iron
clad and named Virginia, was to de
stroy the Cumberland, was put into
the water in 1855. The Hartford was
launched in 1S58. The Cumberland,
Merrimac and Hartford were all
navy-yard built. The new Cumber
land is to be. used as a training-ship,
and therefore her service will be of
preparation rather than war. ,But it
is well that training-ships should bear
heroic names, since the , associations
that cluster about them are inspira
tionsllo young tars. . The. training
squadron of sailing vessels when com
pleted will be made up of the Chesa
peake, Cumberland, Intrepid and the
brig Boxer. Of these the Chesapeake
repeats .the name of a ship singularly
unfortunate, but whose final disaster
was almost redeemed by the devotion
of ;' Lawrence ; _the original _ Intrepid
perished ;in her duty, and Somers and
her crew were great exemplars of su
preme . sl'lf-sacriflce. ' The Cumber
land's heroic story will live forever.
The , Boxer alone carries in her name
the association of victory. â Boston

SUPREME COURT RULES
AGAINST THE MOUNT VmSL
Affirms the Judgment of the Ixmer
Tribunal in Action Brought
by Administratrix.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â The appellate
division of thÂ« Supreme Court*here
handed down a decision to-day affirm
ing the judgment of the special term
in the action brought by Susan Mount,
as administratrix, against Rev. Daniel
S. Tuttle, as senior Bishop of the Pro
testant Episcopal Church; Rev. James
B. Funston, as missionary Bishop of]
Boise, and Rev. Lemuel H. Wells, as
missionary Bishop of Spokane. # The
case arose under the will of Miss Mary
B. Mount, who died In 1899. The will
was drawn in 1880. There was a legacy
of $20,000 for a church and $5000 for a
rectory within the Protestant ' Episco
pal diocese of Utah and Idaho. Bishop
Tuttle was at that time missionary
Bishop for Utah and Idaho. The action
was brought to secure a determination
as to the validity of the bequest. The
Attorney General, being made a party â¢
defendant, appeared and " answered, j
asking that the will be declared valid.
The court, however, declared the will
void and the appellate division af
firmed this judgment.

New York Stock Market.
NKV YORK. Dec. 25.â There was little in
â¢ to-day's stock market to call for comment.
The li"tlCFsnesf and neglect of the trading
â¢jn'.iuntfd to absolute Idle-nets for long inter
vals. The fctu-ndan.ee was nuagÂ»r from the
â¢firm and many members left the floor during

any awakening of interest. Even the usual

â¢jrctovrd dullnesE the prlneijwil feature of the
market -.vas its strong undertone. There was
BO yielding tendency at ary time, and the
â¢low", hardmtng process established a number
Cf fair aovancts. Suvh contracts as remained
to be clos-d uj> were evidently on the short
side, and the rising tendency waÂ» generally at
" iributed t-> coverirg of these. News was of
little importance and its Influence was not dis
â¢ ctmible in the movement. The usual fore
casts for the Mdr/i currency moveroent with
the interior Indicated sufficient receipts to off
set the sold export* and eub-treasury require

â¢ this r.rr.e are problematical, but thÂ»re ha* been j
no' sign of any such stock market liquidation |
ms th*t Â»hlch caused last week's large loan
contraction. The state of the money market
â¦"ft'eetually quiets all interest in the showir.j:
of bank statements at this time. Money is
difficult to i'!ace en Â«^I1 and the lenders on
time art growing more and more lenient
regarding collateral. Loans for six -months j
'are made on all Industrial collateral at about j
the same rate* as on the urual mixed col
lateral. The outward movement of gold
eoually fails to aroune Interest in view of
this condition cf the rnori<>y market. The

fact, the largest for the corresponding week ,
in mur yearÂ«. The wheat outgo continues in- |
â  igr.ificant compared with that of former year*
in the recent past. News cf the breaking of

' Prlceg were inclined to gravitate to a lower
â¢ >vel with the. inanition of the trading, but
â¢wjth vmal! advance* *o that the change of
Â»Â«Â£t iwk'i level is not significant. Part of
the dullness la attributable to the natural dls
incKrutticn of the tracing class to enter upon
leree ccmmttrr.eny* on the eve of a prolon^d
holiday cwir.g to the danger cf sudden devel

*>5 have iho natutal effect of curtailing ope
n^.r^m jn the s-.ock market even when epec
ti^itive interest is awake. Them? normal fac

eral receipts in the Northwest. The volume of

about the same.' Chicago advanced lc. The

' 'There was a general disposition on the part
" of local shorts to even up on account of the
double holiday, but there was a pretty good
commlflsion-house demand. Influenced largely
by reports of unsettled weather In Argentine.
; The cash situation showed no change and still
has a dragging tendency. The. Modern Miller
j reports general condition of crops satisfactory.
j Such is likely to make us a good trading mar
! ket, but for the present we are Inclined to
the buying slde # on the sharp breaks."
1 There will be no more grain markets either
here or In the East, until Tuesday.
This market was steady but dull and of a

Poultry and Game.
Receipts, of dressed Turkeys from Califor
nlan points approximated CO tons, against 61
tons on the preceding; day and, wltb the de
mand steady, the market was naturally firmer
and prices were advanced sharply.. Some small
receivers, who were firm In their view*, were
asking 28S30c per pound during the early
trade, but retailers refused to buy -at those
figures. The leading handlers were more con
servative and named 27c as the top for prime
stock, and that price was well maintained
throughout the day. Some poor and scrubby
lots were offering below the minimum .quota
tion, but there was very little such stock on
the market. There were several carloads of
Eastern chilled Turkeys offering, which moved
off freely at 20025c: California stock was
well cleaned up and firm at the close. There
was very little doing In live Poultry and
prices of Chickens. Geese and Ducks were
nominally unchanged. There were no changes
in Game.

and the market became strong and ruled so

END OF TWELVE
YEARS' CONTEST
Litigation Over Estate of
Amasa P. Willey Is Con
cluded by a Compromise
LAWYERS GET SHAEE
Fees Are Awarded and Cash
and Realty Are Given to
Housekeeper of a Suicide
A dozen years of bitter strife In the
courts over the will of Amasa P. Wll
ley ended yesterday In Judge Coffey's
department with the judicial approval
of a compromise of the litigation. Ten
or twelve lawyers who have taken part
in the battle were' present and agreed
that the services of Mastick, Van Fleet
& Mastick, attorneys for the trustees,
were worth $10,000, which sum Judge
Coffey awarded them. The trustees,
Carpenter and Boericke, were allowed
their legal commissions ' and the estate
was declared ready for distribution-
By the terms of the compromise $15,
000 worth of realty and $3400 In cash
will go to Mrs. Muirhead, $1600 In cash
and $9000 In property to Attorney Tim
othy J. Lyons, who prosecuted the long
contest, and the remainder, amounting
to about $105,000. will be distributed
among Willey's relatives und the char
ities named In the will â twenty-six
in all.
When Amasa P. Willey died he left
all of his property in trust for his
relatives and for chanty, providing
that $500 a year should be paid to his
son, Charles Walter Willey, who by
his dissipation had Incurred his father's
displeasure. Young Willey contested
the trust clause in the will and it was
declared invalid on the lines laid down
fn the decision of the Fair case. Then
he contested the will on the ground
that the trust was invalid, but the will
was upheld. Another contest was
lodged on the contention that the will
left more than a third of the property
to charity and therein was void.
In the meantime Charles Walter Wil
ley committed suicide by asphyxiation'.
An Illegitimate son of his had died and
he left his property to his hoasekeeper,
Mrs. Muirhead. His relatives opposed
t]iis disposition of his estate, but they
were defeated in the courts. He had
assigned his interest in the father's
estate to Lyons as security for his fee
in the contest. Twice had the litiga
tion been to the Supreme Court, and
in arraying for another trial all sides
came to a conclusion that a compromise
would be the best way out of the con
troversy. Every one interested agreed
to the terms which were approved by
the court yesterday.

as administrator of the estate of the

abound in this number. The regular de
partments are also complete. The Saun
terer is as newsy as ever, and he dis
cusses in a most entertaining manner,

with the recent Bohemian jinks, tells of
an embarrassing situation in the Repub
lican organization, discusses some of our

licity and others that flout it. He also
discusses the purposes of the Sequoia

esting article in this number deals with
the performances in literature of Cali

have made it a magazine of exceptionally

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 24. 1904.
FATHER HUGH LAGAN
IS CALLED BY DEATH
RECTOR OF SACRED HEART I
, CHURCH. WHO DIED IN LANE
v. HOSPITAL. YESTERDAT. [
The Rev. Father Hugh Lagan, rector
of Sacred Heart Church, Fillmore
street, passed away yesterday evening
after a comparatively brief Illness, at
Lane Hospital. The news will come
as a severe shock to his parishioners
and a multitude of friends throughout
the State, for no man in the community
was more beloved than the late Father
Lagan.
Last April the lamented pastor left
San Francisco in company with the
late Rev. Father Scanlan with the in
tention of visiting Europe. Father
Scanlan was stricken with pneumonia,
while in New York and died at St. Vin
cent's Hospital.
Later Father Lagan paid his visit
to the old country, and , on his return
to San Francisco, November 29 last,
he was found to be suffering acutely
from an abscess in the ear.
His condition was such as to cause
his relatives and friends anxiety. In
response to the wishes of his medical
advisers he went into Lane Hospital
to be treated by Dr. Barkan. Last
Wednesday he submitted to an ope
ration, which was successful. On
Thursday afternoon, at about 4:30
o'clock, however, he suddenly sank
Into unconsciousness from which he
never recovered.
Throughout his illnees Father Lagan
was surrounded by loving relatives and
the priests of his church.
The Rev. Father Philip Byrne, who
has been acting pastor of Sacred Heart
Church since the late rector's depar
ture last April, the Rev. Father Rob
ert Sesnon, the Rev. Father Thomas
Comerford and the Rev. Father Wil
liam Fleming were constantly at the
patient's side, as were also his broth
ers, Dr. John Lagan and Bernard La
gan.
Others who ministered to the late
rector's comfort during his trying ill
ness were his cousins, Miss Mary La
gan and Dr. Edward and Dr. Hugh
Lagan.
Father Lagan was 52 years of age,
and was born in County Derry, Ireland.
For a number of years he was pastor
of St. Raphael's Church, San Rafael,
and was one of the most. revered men
In Marin County.
Mrs. Rice Passes Away.
Mrs. Lydia Catherine Rice died
Thursday morninc at her home, 1122
Pine street, after an illness of a few
weeks. Among the pioneers of San
Francisco she had many friends and
a wide acquaintance, for she came to
the city with her husband, Dr. De Witt
C. Rice, in 1864. They had lived in
Marysville for ten years previously.
Dr. Rice died several years ago. Mrs.
Rice had lived ;n her Pine-street home
for forty years, and in It was -always
found cordial hospitality. In the early
pioneer days she took . a prominent
jart in charitable work in the city.
She was born in Canajoharie, N. Y.,
and' was 72 years old at the time of
her death. . by her hus
band she came to California by way
of Panama in 1854. A' daughter,' Mrs.
H. C. Watson, survives."
Aged Beneficiaries Dead.
Six of the eight brothers and sisters
in Germany . to whom Christopher
Rohlf bequeathed his savings of $5500
were dead before the will was exe
cuted, but he did not know it. Rohlf
died in October of .last year and . his
will, made in March, 1900, \ywas filed
for probate yesterday by* Wiechen Ehl
ers and Mary Ehlers. Had the brothers
and sisters all been alive when' the will
was made their ages would ' have
ranged- from 69 to 80-years, all but
one being over 70. The two now liv
ing are 71 and 73. The- families of
the departed ones will get their shares
of the legacy. , .

STRANGER DIES
AT THE TABLE
Gordon W. Lloyd of Detroit
Drops Dead From Heart
Disease in Eestaurant
GUESTS ARE IGNORANT
People Chat Merrily While
Dining, Unconscious That
a Tragedy Had Occurred
As he was rising from a chair at
Johnson's restaurant last night Gordon
W. Lloyd of Detroit lurched forward
and expired under the table. Heart
disease was the cause of death.
The restaurant was crowded, but few
people were aware of the fatality be
cause of the coolness displayed by
Police Captain Duke. When Lloyd fell
the captain, who was eating his dinner
at a table near by,' wen:' over quietly
and tried to restore him to conscious
ness. Under his direction an ambu
lance was called, but Lloyd was be
yond assistance before it arrived.
The body was left under the table
where It lay. Captain Duke ordered a
policeman, who was called in, to cover
the body with a cloth, then seated him
self at his table. People coming in and
out of the place did not know that a
dead man was there. Merry* parties
laughed and chatted at tables close
to where the body lay- The arrival of
the Morgue wagon came as a shock.
At the Morgue $2500 in bills was
found on the body. The only letter
carried was one from Cook & Sons
containing a return ticket to Australia.
Lloyd's address was 14 Newberry build
ing, Detroit. He had been living at the
Palace Hotel for three days. It is
thought that he intended to sail to
night for Australia.
An autopsy showed. that heart disease
was the cause of death. The body will
be held at the Morgue until friends or
lelatives provide for It.
DIES AFTER ORDERING MEAL.
SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 23. â Wil
liam Devine. a laborer, walked Into a
local restaurant, ordered a modest
meal and as it was brought to him fell
to the floor unconscious, dying shortly
after of heart disease. Among the
letters found in Devine's pockets was
one from his wife in Philadelphia tell
ing him she had just become a mother.
A five-cent oiecewas all the money
found on Devine and it is believed
that excitement due to his inability to
pay for the meal he had ordered
brought on the fatal attack.
