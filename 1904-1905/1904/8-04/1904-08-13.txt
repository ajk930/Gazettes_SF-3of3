duty. late to-night, every report re
ceived '. was eagerly scanned, but the
fragmentary news from foreign and
Japanese, sources left much, doubt as to
the result of the fight between the Port
Arthur squadron and the Japanese
fleet and as to the wherealibuts of the
Russian shiDS. All that seems to be
established is that there was a day's
running light and a night torpedo at
tack, in which some of the ships- be
came" parted ; from the squadron; but
the last dispatches from Shanghai seem
to ; indicate that the Japanese were
beaten off, though with what damage
is not clear. '
Though at least four Russian battle
ships appear to have reached the open
sea, the cruisers Pallada, Askold: and
Diana and one battleship remain unac
counted for. The damages sustained
by the | battleship Cesareyitch give her
sanctuary in the harbor of Tsingchou,
but the Novik is under notice, served
by the> German, authorities,* to leave.
-As she is very fast, being capable of
making twenty-three knots an hour,
there are ' strong hopes that : she , will
escape, unless there are Japanese
cruisers awaiting her on the. outside.

at Harbin. The indications, however,
point to Liaoyang.
'There is a general feeling that our

than they would in the hill fighting

"It is estimated that the Japanese
force consists of from 240.00C to 260.000

they will detach & portion of their troops

The hearts of the Russian people are
likely to be more deeply touched by the
good fortune of the Imperial family
than by a dozen victories or defeats in
the Far East, and the superstitious
Russian character will read in it an
augjury of a better time. St. Seraphim,
who was canonized last summer by
the Emperor at Sarafoff, has now be
come a favorite patron saint, as 1 the
birth of the heir is attributed chiefly' to
his interposition. The Emperor will
signalize the event "by some gracious
act, like the remission" of arrearage of
taxes and amnesty, and for the. next
two weeks, until the christening, there
The christening of the heir will take
place in a fortnight. It will be a cere
mony of the most elaborate sort. In
accordance with Russian imperial cus
tom it will be performed in the im
perial chapel of the Peterhof Palace,
credited with being the most magnifi
cent chapel in Russia.
With the boom of the first gun the
people in the streets stopped to listen
and count the guns. Only thirty-one
are fired for a girl. When the thirty
second boomed and the people were
aware that at last an heir to the
throne was born there were scenes of
rejoicing everywhere and before the
salute was finished the whole city had
blossomed out with flags and buntings
and the shipping in" the harbor was
dressed. Then the bells of the churches
began to ring wildly.
In the meantime the announcement
had been telegraphed -to the most re
mote corners of the empire. In all the
towns and cities th$ glad tidings were
spread with the clanging of bells and
the booming of cannon. Thanksgiving
services followed in all the churches.
SAINT GIVEN THE CRKDIT.
The birth of the heir to the throne
was attended by all the ceremony or
dained by imperial tradition. In ac
cordance with the Russian law there
were present, besides the Emperor,
Baron Fredericks, the master of the
ceremonies, and Prince Dolgorouky,
the grand marshal o-f the court. Dr.
Rott, the Emperor's family physician,
and Dr. Hlruch were in attendance.
Dr. Rott personally announced the
birth of the heir to the awaiting im
perial family. An imperial salute of
101 cuns was fired, first from Peter
hof and then repeated by all the forts
around St. Petersburg.
CHRISTENING OF TlfE HEIR,
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug.- 13, 4
a. m. â This morning the Empress and
heir to the throne are both making
satisfactory progress.
An imperial manifesto is published
announcing the birth. It invites all
Russians to offer their prayers for
the prosperity of the heir to the
throne.
In receiving the congratulations of
his court yesterday the Emperor in a
brief reply said:
"I am happier at the birth of a son
and heir than at Â¦ a victory of my
troops, for now I face the future
calmly and without alarm, knowing
by this sign that the war will be
brought to a happy conclusion."
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 12.â A son
and heir to the Russian throne was
born at 12:30 o'clock this afternoon.
The birth so greatly wished for, that
of an heir to the crown, occurred
not In the great palace at Peter
hof, but in the Alexandra Villa, one of
a group of four small palaces in a se
cluded corner of the magnificent Peter
hof Park. In v one of these buildings
the Empress had been living for
weeks.
BERLIN,*; Aug. : . Klelncj
Journal says it expects that the birth
of an heir to the Russian throne will
be followed in a few days' by a procla
mation of a constitution, claiming to
have been informed that Emperor
Nicholas vowed he would give a con
stitution to Russia if the Empress
gave birth to a son.

the Home of the Epiphany for the rest
of my term. This was on the recom
mendation of the medical officers at
Ayiesbury, who thought It necessary
for my health's sake."
Mrs. Maybrick then gave an extended
account of her life In prison. With her
eyes filled with tears and in broken
voice her sentences came slowly. She
was known as convict "29 L," the last
named letter meaning "life." She
worked In the kitchen and sometimes
as a seamstress.
After relating many Incidents of pris
on life she said:
"We heard of Queen Victoria's death,
and on Edward's coronation day we
were allowed extra meat and some
plum pudding."
Mrs. Maybrick declined to discuss her
future or whether there would be a
reconciliation with the children..
"First let me ask you," she com
menced, "to say how grateful I am to
all the kind friends who have sent me
and my mother messages and congrat
ulations on my release. See," pointing
to letters and telegrams scattered
about the room, "they come from all
over the world â from India, Africa and
the Continent and, of course, from
England and America. Please tell
them that, although I -am unable to
acknowledge them. I am deeply moved
by them. Mr. Choate and Henry
Waite have always been most earnest
in my cause. I owe Mr. Harding, in
London, a debt I can never hope to
repay. Some day, perhaps, I shall
meet them all."
Mrs. Maybrick and I settled down to
talk an hour or more about her case,
her prison agonies, her future and her
hopes. I inquired when she was first
informed of her intended release. She
said:
"In February, 1903, I was definitely
Informed my case would follow the
regular course, i. e., five years off for

MONTHS- OF ANXIOUS WAITING.
"How anxiously I waited for those
last few months to pass you may guess,
and it was on January 25 last that I
left Ayiesbury jail, after serving fifteen
years. Not a word had been said to any
other prisoner. The actual date of my
going was known only to the gov
ernor, uhe matrons and myself. In the
company of the assistant matron, who
was kindness Itself to me, I walked out
of the gates at half -past 6 In the morn

The very antithesis of mental and

""We are awaiting developments here

point to Liaoyang.
'There is a general feeling that our

"It is estimated that the Japanese
force consists of from 240.00C to 260.000

The hearts of the Russian people are
likely to be more deeply touched by the
good fortune of the Imperial family
than by a dozen victories or defeats in
the Far East, and the superstitious
Russian character will read in it an
augjury of a better time. St. Seraphim,
who was canonized last summer by
the Emperor at Sarafoff, has now be
come a favorite patron saint, as 1 the
birth of the heir is attributed chiefly' to
his interposition. The Emperor will
signalize the event "by some gracious
act, like the remission" of arrearage of
taxes and amnesty, and for the. next
two weeks, until the christening, there
The christening of the heir will take
place in a fortnight. It will be a cere
mony of the most elaborate sort. In
accordance with Russian imperial cus
tom it will be performed in the im
perial chapel of the Peterhof Palace,
credited with being the most magnifi
cent chapel in Russia.
With the boom of the first gun the
people in the streets stopped to listen
and count the guns. Only thirty-one
are fired for a girl. When the thirty
second boomed and the people were
aware that at last an heir to the
throne was born there were scenes of
rejoicing everywhere and before the
salute was finished the whole city had
blossomed out with flags and buntings
and the shipping in" the harbor was
dressed. Then the bells of the churches
began to ring wildly.
In the meantime the announcement
had been telegraphed -to the most re
mote corners of the empire. In all the
towns and cities th$ glad tidings were
spread with the clanging of bells and
the booming of cannon. Thanksgiving
services followed in all the churches.
SAINT GIVEN THE CRKDIT.
The birth of the heir to the throne
was attended by all the ceremony or
dained by imperial tradition. In ac
cordance with the Russian law there
were present, besides the Emperor,
Baron Fredericks, the master of the
ceremonies, and Prince Dolgorouky,
the grand marshal o-f the court. Dr.
Rott, the Emperor's family physician,
and Dr. Hlruch were in attendance.
Dr. Rott personally announced the
birth of the heir to the awaiting im
perial family. An imperial salute of
101 cuns was fired, first from Peter
hof and then repeated by all the forts
around St. Petersburg.
CHRISTENING OF TlfE HEIR,
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug.- 13, 4
a. m. â This morning the Empress and
heir to the throne are both making
satisfactory progress.
An imperial manifesto is published
announcing the birth. It invites all
Russians to offer their prayers for
the prosperity of the heir to the
throne.
In receiving the congratulations of
his court yesterday the Emperor in a
brief reply said:
"I am happier at the birth of a son
and heir than at Â¦ a victory of my
troops, for now I face the future
calmly and without alarm, knowing
by this sign that the war will be
brought to a happy conclusion."
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 12.â A son
and heir to the Russian throne was
born at 12:30 o'clock this afternoon.
The birth so greatly wished for, that
of an heir to the crown, occurred
not In the great palace at Peter
hof, but in the Alexandra Villa, one of
a group of four small palaces in a se
cluded corner of the magnificent Peter
hof Park. In v one of these buildings
the Empress had been living for
weeks.
BERLIN,*; Aug. : . Klelncj
Journal says it expects that the birth
of an heir to the Russian throne will

have been informed that Emperor

gave birth to a son.

"We took a train from Ayiesbury to
London and then went from Paddlng

the Home of the Epiphany for the rest
of my term. This was on the recom
mendation of the medical officers at
Ayiesbury, who thought It necessary
for my health's sake."
Mrs. Maybrick then gave an extended
account of her life In prison. With her
eyes filled with tears and in broken
voice her sentences came slowly. She
was known as convict "29 L," the last
named letter meaning "life." She
worked In the kitchen and sometimes
as a seamstress.
After relating many Incidents of pris
on life she said:
"We heard of Queen Victoria's death,
and on Edward's coronation day we
were allowed extra meat and some
plum pudding."
Mrs. Maybrick declined to discuss her
future or whether there would be a
reconciliation with the children..
"First let me ask you," she com
menced, "to say how grateful I am to
all the kind friends who have sent me
and my mother messages and congrat
ulations on my release. See," pointing
to letters and telegrams scattered
about the room, "they come from all
over the world â from India, Africa and
the Continent and, of course, from
England and America. Please tell
them that, although I -am unable to
acknowledge them. I am deeply moved
by them. Mr. Choate and Henry
Waite have always been most earnest
in my cause. I owe Mr. Harding, in
London, a debt I can never hope to
repay. Some day, perhaps, I shall
meet them all."
Mrs. Maybrick and I settled down to
talk an hour or more about her case,
her prison agonies, her future and her
hopes. I inquired when she was first
informed of her intended release. She
said:
"In February, 1903, I was definitely
Informed my case would follow the
regular course, i. e., five years off for

MONTHS- OF ANXIOUS WAITING.
"How anxiously I waited for those
last few months to pass you may guess,
and it was on January 25 last that I
left Ayiesbury jail, after serving fifteen
years. Not a word had been said to any
other prisoner. The actual date of my
going was known only to the gov
ernor, uhe matrons and myself. In the
company of the assistant matron, who
was kindness Itself to me, I walked out
of the gates at half -past 6 In the morn

The very antithesis of mental and

There are a great many traditions
about Alexis. The first Alexis, who
won many victories over the Poles, en
deared himself to his people and Is
known In Russian history as "the
Father of His Country."
The name is not a particularly
lucky one. Alexis Petrovitch was or
dered to be executed by . his father,
Peter the Great, for treason, but died
In prison.
A curious coincidence Is that the
heir was born on the anniversary ot
the canonization of St. Seraphim and
another coincidence is that the birth
occurred on the anniversary of the ap
pointment of Admiral Alexieff as Vice
roy in the Far East.
The * people throughout Russia, not
ably the clergy, have been praying for
an heir to the throne, and the famous
Greek priest, Father John, of Kron
stadt, has recently been visiting the
Alexandra villa at Intervals to Join in
the prayers for an heir.
A day marked by the display of
flags, the firing of salutes, the holding
of religious services and the extending
of official congratulations was fol
lowed by a night .of brilliant Illumi
nation. Garlands ' and lamps were
strung to-night across almost every
house front, while from, many of the
larger buildings flashed the Russian
arms, the Imperial monogram and
other devices picked out In electric
globes. Early tens of thousands of
tapers glimmered before the altars of
St. Petersburg's many shrines. In
chapels and cathedrals everywhere
there were solmen choruses of thanks
giving â from the Imperial chapel of
the Peterhof Palace to the humble
lamp-lit shrines of the streets, where
hurrying pedestrians, laborers and
drosky drivers waited to cross them
selves. The street crowds to-night
were, however, much quieter than
usual on a holiday, for the popular
rejoicing over the event at the Alex
ander Villa could not dispel the anx
iety which prevailed regarding the
fate of the squadron, on which, so
much depends.
There is already a revival of the talk
that, with the succession to the throne
assured, the Emperor will follow the
example of the house of Romanoff and
; go to the front.
The heir's name will be Alexis Nlkol
aevltch and if he reigns he probably
will assume the title of Alexis IL The

LONDON, Aug. 12.â The British offi
cials and foreign diplomats regard the
action of the Japanese in cutting out
the Russian torpedo-boat destroyer
Ryeshitelni at Chefu as raising a se
rious question, of importance to all na
tions.
The Foreign Office received this
morning a dispatch from the British
Consul at Chefu, confirming the cap
ture of the Ryeshitelni and her removal
by her captors from the harbor.
The Consul added that the facts were
immediately reported to the Chinese
Governor and the foreign diplomats in
Peking. The former evinced consider
able concern, not so much at the fact
that the attack was made on the de
stroyer as at the precedent established
by Japan, which 'Russia may follow In
case of emergency, thereby, extending
the area of hostilities, which Secretary
Hay sought to circumscribe.
' It Is believed that Japan will
promptly disavow the action of the
commanders of her destroyers and re
turn the Ryeshitelni to Chefu.
Expects Japan to Promptly Disavow
Action of Naval Officers.

CHICAGO, Aug. 12.â Mayor Har
rison will to-morrow be asked to do
what he can toward settling the stock
yards strike. The retail meat dealers
and grocers to-night decided to urge
the city { 's executive to take a pqsition
in .the present conflict similar to that
assumed by him In the streetcar
strike last fall.
A riot in" crowded Fifth avenue,
within a square of the City Hall,
capped the climax of disorder in the
stockyards strike to-day. During the
day half a dozen men were hurt in
various encounters and shots were
fired during an attack on a trainload
of "strike-breakers." All told, to
day's violence was more widespread
than In any previous twelve hours of
the strike.
President Golden of the Teamsters'
Union was attacked while trying to

Four hundred persons had pursued
Falk, not knowing he was a unionist,

Japan's Loss in Naval Fljrht.
TOKIO, Aug. 12. â The casualties in
the Japanese navy on Wednesday,
August 10, numbered 170.
"Toward morning two Japanese tor
pedo-boats approached the Russian de
stroyer, fastened a rope to the bow,
raised the anchor and began to tow the
vessel from the harbor. When the
Japanese torped6-boat towed the Rye
shitelni out of the harbor they were
compelled to pass in full view of three
Chinese cruisers..
"There is no doubt that the Russian
destroyer was completely in the hands
of the Chinese authorities. Haggerty
of the Associated Press, with an inter
preter, was on board the Ryeshitelni
and witnessed the negotiations. He
has a document recording the conver
sation of the Chinese officer with the
Russian commander, " conducted
through his interpreter."
CHICAGO, Aug. 12.â A special to the
Chicago Daily News from Chefu says:
"After the Russian destroyer Rye
shitelni'arrived here yesterday it was
boarded by an officer from the Chinese
cruiser Haichl, : who stayed on deck
until the vessel had been completely
dismantled. The same evening the
small arms and breech blocks of the
guns were loaded Â¦ into the Chinese
launch and taken in charge by the
Chinese authorities. The destroyer
then anchored with its entire crew and
officers near the harbor lightship.
"An official report from the master
of the lightship to the commissioner of
customs filed this morning states that
about midnight he observed a small
boat, lowered from one of the Japanese
vessels, run alongside the Russian de
stroyer. One officer and five armed
men were In the Japanese boat. They
boarded the destroyer and began fir
ing. Hand-to-hand fighting continued
for about an hour.
"Some of the crew of the Russian de
stroyer jumped overboard; others were
thrown over. The entire affair was
witnessed by the master of the light
ship, which was only 100 feet away.
He had a boat lowered and rescued
one officer and two men. Captain
Shestakovsky of the Russian destroyer
was wounded. He is now aboard the

PEKING, Aug. 12. â The Chefu In

is the, general opinion in diplomatic
circles' that Japan has committed, to
say the least, a grave Indiscretion.
The report current here that the Chi

prevent the capture of the Ryeshitelni
Is declared to place China in an un
enviable position.

The note of alarm sounded by the
Pacific Mail Company's refusal to ac
cept mining machinery from the Dun-
Jiam," Carrigan & Hayden Company
for shipment to Korea has awakened
local merchants and shipping men to
the danger threatened American co-m
ir.erce with the Orient. Yesterday the
Chamber of Commerce called a special
meeting to consider the best steps to
Insure the safety of the shipping in
terests of the United States in Eastern
waters.
Owing to the fact that many mem
bers of the chamber vpre unable to be
present President Newhall suggested
that action upon the vital matter be
postponed until a full attendance could
be assured and all commercial bodies
cf the city represented. Monday at 3
p. m. was the date set for this impor
tant meeting.
General Manager R. P. Schwerin of
the Pacific Mail Company sent a sug
gestion to the chamber which will
probably be adopted. He recommends
that a telegram be sent to the Secre
tary of State requesting modification
by Russia of the articles now declared
by her as contraband or constructive
contraband and asking protection for
American goods in American ships
bound to neutral ports, such goods as
the United States makes clear by
proclamation that they do not consider
contraband or constructive contra
band.
"No doubt if this telegram was sent
by the chamber," says Schwerin, "In
conjunction with the commercial bod
ies of the North Pacific Coast as well
es those of Eastern cities which have
chipping interests with Japan, our
Government would take immediate ac-
Cion."
"If this was done I am certain that
Jiussia will modify her notice known
es the 'Bulletin of the King, number
16,' which was indorsed by the Czar of
Kussia, February 14, 1904."
A communication from Andrew Car-
Tigan set forth the damage being done
to San Francisco shipping interests.
Fteamship lines of the North Pacific
Coast have announced that they will
accept reasonable cargoes for the
Orient. This is because their steamers
are nearly all foreign vessels under
charter.
. Such a condition of affairs, Carrigan
Jriaintains. tends to divert traffic from
Ean Francisco. "It took years to build
up our trade with the Orient," says
Carrigan, "bur all the good work may
be destroyed in a few months if these
conditions prevail."
The Chamber of Commerce invites
fill of the general public interested to
cttend the meeting on Monday at 3
o'clock, when definite action will be
taken.

CHEFU, Aug. 12.â Captain snesta
kovsky of the Ryeshitelni. who was
wounded in the leg by a bullet, when
the Russian destroyer was attacked
early this morning, was saved with
twenty of his men by boats from the
Chinese cruiser Halnyung.
Interviews with Admiral Sah and
Captain Ching, who is in command of
the Haiyung, indicate that the Chinese
naval authorities were more active
than was at first supposed. When the
first Japanese torpedo-boat destroyer,
towing the Ryeshitelni, departed to the
northward, the second Japanese de
stroyer steered a course past the Hag- .
ship and the cruiser Haichl.
The latter cleared for action and sig
naled to the destroyer to stop. This
was done. Admiral Sah informed the
commander of the Japanese destroyer
that the Ryeshitelni must be returned,'
as neutrality had been flagrantly vio
lated. To this the commander of the
second destroyer replied that he would
overtake the first destroyer and return
to Chefu. Admiral Sah accepted the
word of honor of the Japanese com
mander and allowed .him to depart.
The Chinese admiral is deeply cha
grined at this occurrence and is ill as
a result. He has turned the command
of his squadron over to Captain Ching.
Captain Ching says that when the
Japanese destroyers entered the harbor
of Chefu he sent an officer on board
and assured Captain Fujlmoto that tht
Ryeshitelni was disabled, and that her
officers and crew had signed a parole.
l.ater the admiral followed his messen
ger and personally repeated this in
formation at length, whereupon Com
mander Fujimoto said he had no de
signs on the Ryeshitelni.
Admiral Sah next sent an officer in
a small boat to the lightship, which
was near the Ryeshitelni, to watch de
velopments.
APPEALS FOR AMMUNITION".
Captain Shestakovsky, feeling inse
cure, requested that his ammunition
and one torpedo be returned to him, or
that a Chinese cruiser prepare to guard
him. To this the Chinese officer on the
lightship replied that he had been or
dered merely to report developments.
Accordingly, Captain Shestakovsky as
sembled his crew and addressed them,
saying that an attack was possible. All
the men of the Ryeshitelni slept that
night on deck, with life preservers un
der their heads.
When the lieutenant from one of the
; Japanese destroyers boarded the Rye
shitelni at half-past 3 o'clock in the
morning the crew of the boat which
brought him, with bayonets affixed to
the rifies in their hands, followed their
officer. Captain Shestakovsky protest
ed against this, saying:
"I am unable to resist, but this is, a
breach of neutrality and courtesy."
Captain Shestakovsky then secretly
commanded one of his lieutenants to
prepare gunpowder with which, ' to
blow up the Russian destroyer. To
gain the time necessary to make ready
for this, step Captain Shestakovsky
argued international law with the Jap
anese lieutenant, whose reply to all
the contentions of the Russian officer
invariably was:
"Come to the open sea and fight
or prepare *o*be towed out."
RUSSIANS USE THEIR FISTS.
In the meanwhile the command was
issued quietly to the Russian sailors to
resist the, Japanese with, their fists, in
the manner which would be shown
them by their captain.
Continuing his account of the oc
currence, Captain Shestakovsky, said:
"The Japanese officer told me to
surrender and that as a prisoner my.
life would be spared. This insult so
stung me that I struck the Japanese
before" I intended to. I was afraid
that the explosive to blow up our ves
sel had not yet been prepared. My
blow knocked the lieutenant over
board. In-falling he dragged me with
him. He fell into his small boat
alongside, while I fell into the water.
I clung to his throat and pummeled
him until my hold was broken."

minds of the officials here that . the
Japanese have committed an offense
against international law by violating
Chinese neutrality and, in addition,
have broken the agreement they en
tered into at the beginning of the war,
at the Instance of the Unlte'd States
Government, to limit the field of war
like operations to Manchuria and
Korea and their waters.
Should this prove to be the case, the '
results probably will be grave and vex
atious. Under the tenets of interna
tional law the captured vessel mHist be
returned to the custody of the Chinese
Government, and an apology rendered
for the offense against Chinese neu

But if Russian lives have been lost,

greater complication will follow, for
Russia may. in turn hold China respon
sible for the punishment of the Japan
ese, who caused the death of her sail
ors when under the shelter of, the
Chinese port authorities.
Altogether the situation Is full of
danger and the main apprehension of
the officials here is that it may be the
incident .which may break down the
agreement of the powers and plunge

A review of all troops here took place
this morning at 8 o'clock. Long before
that hour every one in camp was astir.
Promptly at the appointed time Gen
eral MacArthur and his staffs were
ready on the big south flat of the en
campment. The troops were air lined
up on the west side.
The day was perfect and the scene
that was viewed by the spectators on
the hillside was a most inspiring one.
First in the review came the Fifteenth
Infantry, followed by the provisional
regiment, the .hospital corps . detach
ment, three batteries of artillery, and
the third squadron of the Ninth Cav
alry. ' .
General MacArthur expressed himself
as highly pleased with the review and
with the appearance of the troops. Mu
sic resounds from morning until night.
When the bands are not playing for
drills or parades they are on the hill
sides practicing. .
The grand divisional review of the
troops will take place on Sunday, Au
gust 21, on the grounds directly east
of and adjoining Asuncion station. It
was the original intention to have held
these maneuvers on the big camp field
at Atascadero, but General MacArthur
late last night decided to have them at
Asuncion. This will save the public
from .a drive to the camp. Passengers
from San Francisco can leave there at
8 a. m., see a review of the biggest as
semblage of troops that has ever taken
place on the Pacific Coast, then visit
the great camp, if they desire, and re r
turn to San Francisco the same even

ATASCADERO. Aug. 12.â All interest

tered in the arrival of the State militia,
which Is due at daybreak to-morrow
morning. It requires eight separate
trains of twelve cars each to transport
the several commands from their dif
ferent headquarters in the State. Ar
rangements have been made whereby
this large body of men and immense
amount of impedimenta will be handled
without delay to the regular traffic of
the Southern Pacific Company.
General MacArthur. on his side, has
perfected all plans to receive them at
Atascadero station. He has arranged
for sixty teams, each drawn by four
mules, to meet them there and convey
them to the camp. To expedite this ex
traordinary movement the railroad
company has arranged every facility,
Including platform chutes for unload
ing horses and the necessary sidetracks
to hold the long trains of cars. Train
master E. A. Steininger and Traveling
Passenger Agent Floyd S. Judah. will
be at Atascadero to take charge of the
detraining of the troops in the interests
of the Southern Pacific.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 12.â Government
officials are thoroughly aroused at the
rapid increase of the immigration and
naturalization frauds and the great dif
ficulty of coping with the matter. Com
missioner Sargent of the Bureau of Im
migration had another conference with
the President to-day.
The authorities net only have to cope
with forged naturalization paper*, but
with the willingness with which the
witnesses perjuie themselves to obtain
citizenship for their friends. In the
latter respect it is felt that the laws
are faulty. It is held that the right to
grant citizenship now allowed in the
States and permitted to any small cir
cuit court anywhere in the laitd should
be exclusively under Federal direction.
It was stated to-day that theestimate
of one hundred thousand aliens in the
country and thirty or forty thousand
io New York, who obtained citizenship
papers irregularly, is undoubtedly too
small. One official declared the total
uould very likely reach from three to
five times that number. It is reported
that secret service agents have discov
ered a regular line of stations for the
printing and sale of false naturaliza
tion blanks through the country. They
are mostly along the routes generally
taken by immigrants. "One is said to

California Coursing Club.
One round of the 96-dog open stake
will be run to-day, commencing at 12

gether with the committee stake, will
be run to-morrow, commencing at 10:30.
In honor of the event all the other
parks will close. For this meeting the
free list is suspended, a fee of 25 cents
being exacted at the gate. The profits
of the meeting go to further the work

Committee. This is one of the events
in the coursing calendar and is always
well supported.
This will be the fourth renewal of
the stake, entry to which is limited to
members of the committee. President

year, nominating the greyhound Sir

loser will drop to .50, and have exactly
the same percentage as the Alameda
club, which has played one match less
than the Pacific and the San Francisco
County teams will have done at closing
time to-morrow.
A. W. Wilding has been In British
Columbia for two weeks, but returns
in time to take part in to-morrow's
match. As he has played in three or
four matches during his holidays, he
has had plenty of practice.
No match having been played last
Sunday and the game played on Sun
day, July 81, not having been a sched
uled one, the standing of the clubs for
the championship pennant remains as
before: Pacific Club, .63; San Fran
cisco County Club, .63; Alameda Club,
.50. and Santa Cruz Club, .33. - The
batting and bowling averages also re
main unchanged, as given in The Call
of July 30.
The regular cricket match between
a team of sailors from British ships
lying in Oakland harbor and an eleven
made up by the Rev. S. H. "Wingfleld
Digby, chaplain of the Seamen's insti

Adams' ground, East Oakland.
The Pacific cricket team will meet
the San Francisco County eleven to

Preparations for the ninth annual
regatta of the Pacific Interclub Yacht
Association are going: on. In addition
to the cups given regularly by J. M.
Macdonough. it is probable there will
be Borne trophies presented by ihe
conclave of Knights Templar. There
was considerable talk among the dele
gates of making the events at the com
ing repatta handicap races, but the
1 idea has been abandoned for this year,
as it is felt the task of handicapping
yachts enrolled in various clubs in a
fair manner is one involving consider
able difficu'ty and requiring much more
time than the committee has at its dis
posal.
.J. M. Macdonough. the donor of the
Maedonough cups, for the first five
years pave a single trophy valued at
$2jO each year, but for the second series
of five years he presented the sum of
1250 annually to be expended in tro
phies for each of the five classes into
Â¦which the yachts are divided. When
he was in San Francisco last August
he suggested a further amendment of
the deed of gift, saying that his cups
;ere intended to encourage the building
end sailing of boats of a normal type
and not to be captured by mug--hunting
racing machines. Handicap races have
been tried frequently in the Eastern
yacht clubs and have proved satisfac
tory to the owners and the clubs. The
principle of handicapping is common to
almost all sports and serves to keep
the interest of many competitors alive.
A. M. Clay laid before the delegates
et the first meeting of the Pacific In
terclub Yacht Association of this sea
con a plan whereby the handicapping
might be arranged. Boats are classi
fied according to their racing length
end are credited with points, each of
Â¦w hlch is regarded as equivalent to one
fifth of a foot. The boats are then
rated according to their performances
in club races, if it is a club event, or in
interclub regattas, if it is an interclub
race, being charged with two points
for each race won during a period of
four or five years. According to the
liew rating thus arrived at the boats
receive time allowances. When the
California Yacht Club first took up
handicap races this was the plan adopt
ed. A boat which has never won a
race is, of course, not penalized.
This vears delegates are not dia-
I-osed. however, to take up the work
Kext year it Is proposed to bring the
matter up early in the spring and try
to arrive at a satisfactory result. It'
has been suggested that special prizes
should be offered for cruising yachts,
; but this nuggestion involves the diffi
culty of deciding what a' cruising yacht
is. Boats like the sloop Aeolus, Gad
der, Helen, Truant and Presto go on
cruises, and yet were built with a view
to racing and winning prizes. The
Challenger cruises up fhe'Napa and
Bacramento rivers and yet is called a
racing machine. The advocates of races
for "cruising yachts" would not hear
of the Challenger entering such events
and would like to exclude the other
boats named in the foregoing. The
committee that first undertakes to
handicap the yachts for an interclub
race will have its work cut out. In
the Eastern States boats of the scow
type race against boats of that type
end fin-keel boats against fin-keel
boats, so that the result, apart from
the element of luck that is Inevitable
and necessary In all sports, depends
purely on seamanship, good Judgment
and clever handling of the yachts
There will be the sound of rejoicing
to-night In Tiburon. The San Francis
co Yacht Club will turn over to the
Corinthian tars the Perpetual Challenge
Cup won by the sloop Corinthian from
the eloop Challenger In the recent race
for the most important yachting
trophy on the bay of San Francisco.
Port Captain John H. Keefe will have
e Corinthian Eupper of chowder, beans,
brown bread, amber ale, black coffee
tnd other colored nutriment ready at
6:S0 p. m. After supper there will be

coveted trophy will be lightened as
much as possible for the losers.

Attorney Lukens said yesterday tha{
Whitlock had demanded that he be
retained in Clark's employ at his for
mer salary, but that Clark had
"passed it up" to his stable foreman,
one Donnelly, who said he would em
ploy Whitlock, but would only pay hinj
what his services were worth. "On
account of the attitude of Clark and

In the series of suits against
Charles W. Clark, the son of the mul
ti-millionaire Senator *ron Montana,
which have followed the young man's
marriage to Miss Cella Tobin there is
at least the saving grace of variety.
First the Bank of California attached
his residence, formerly the Hobart
property at San Mateo, for $25,000
due. This was settled out of court.
Next a mining expert named Brigham
sued for $500 fees said to have been
promised for the examination of the
X-Ray mine in Placer County. Yes
terday, through Attorney G. R. Luk
ens, Edward A. Whitlock, who was
employed as a hostler in Clark's barns
at San Mateo. began a suit for $10,
000 damages for personal injuries sus
tained on September 28 of last year.
According to Whitlock's complaint,
he was instructed to mount a scaf
folding and assist in painting one of
the barns. He declares that the scaf
folding was carelessly built and fell
with him. His arm, he says, waa
broken and he waa permanently crip

CHARLES CLARK IS SUED
BY INJURED IIOSTLER
While the party was out they Jumped
up four deer under one tree. They in
cluded three spike bucks and a forked
horn.
Frank W. Fuller; George P. Fuller
and Clarence N. Roolin have returned
from a succesful deer hunf In Gravelly
Valley, Mendocino County.
Deer are unusually plentiful this year
about Point Arena, Mendocino County.
A party from the Point Arena Hot
Springs had a highly successful hunt
recently. Ten deer were killed in one
day. J. R. Norris of this city secured
three, S. A. Pierce brought down two,
Dr. W. A. McCornack, proprietor of the
Springs, secured one, as did also Fred
Warren, Walter Foster, D. O. Becker
and Tom Marich. Nels McGann, the
guide, had out' his famous deer hound
Jet. The party filled out the day. with
some excellent trout .fishing.
Messrs. Al Winkle, Carl Carlson and
William Buttman of this city have re,
turned from a. three weeks', trip to
Buck Mountain, .in 1 Humboldt County.
The party killed four deer, Mr. Winkle
Each member of the party Becured
his legal limit on deer without diffi
culty. They counted thirty-six deer at
one time and killed fiye of them in an
hour. The trip was a rough one, but
the hunters felt well repaid for their
efforts.
Will Janssen Becured three fine bucks
recently on the Black Rock -Range,
near Lay tonvllle, Mendocino County.
He was accompanied by Miss Janssen,
Albert Cahill and Miss* Crowley. The
latV^r, who is but 16 years old, is skilled
in the arts of woodcraft. She Is an ex
pert with the rifle arid is a splendid
equestrienne. In the absence of .her
father she manages his 10,000 acre
ranch. She knows all the haunts of the
deer and the trout. < ; >.
It is always a matter of surprise to
the layman to find that deer can be
killed in Marin and in other counties
within a short ride of San Francisco.
It is' not intended to convey the idea
that they are found in large numbers,
although one sportsman reports having
seen eighteen during a day spent afield
hear Gilroy. The most of the deer in
the State are in the northern counties
and are usually found at considerable
distance from the railroads.
George Dougherty, Lieutenant How
ard and J. Loughnane have Just re
turned from a hunting trip to Hum
boldt County. They are found in their
praise of that county as a sportsman's
paradise. They found both deer and
trout In profusion. . They went to Eu
reka by boat and thence thirty miles by
rail to Altan Junction. After leaving
the latter place they packed In sixty
miles, making their camp at South
Fork Mountains, near the Trinity
County line.

The seventeenth annual tournaments
for. the tennis honors of the qoast are
less than three weeks away and the
cracks are practicing as much as pos
sible. The tournaments this year are
attracting unusual Interest. . This Is
partly due to the fact that Miss May
Sutton, the greatest, woman player in
America, will again be seen at San Ra
fael. The decision of Miss Sutton and
her two clever Bisters to participate
has assured the success of the women's
events. Of course the champion will
have things all her own way, but a
match ' with either of her sisters is al
ways Interesting.
The home players are not conceded
a chance with the Suttons, but they
are thought to be skillful enough to
play Miss Violet or Miss Florence
rather close. Miss Hazel Hotchkiss
and Miss Ratcliffe are the best players
here and much is expected of them.
The presence of several old players
will also make the contests unusually
interesting. The Hardy brothers may
play and Reuben Hunt, the new north
western champion, has already entered
the tournament. Dr. Sumner Hardy
has expressed a willingnnes3 to play and
will do so if he can prevail upon his
brother, Sam. to again enter tournar
ment play. Hunt has made an excel
lent showing in the East and the
cracks are anxious to cross rackets
with him. f
The project of bringing several of the
Eastern cracks to the coast has been
abandoned. The committee is doing
nothing in regard to the matter and if
the Easterners' come they will do. so at
the last moment and on their own re
sponsibility.
The players that will compete this
year are more ' evenly matched than
ever before and no one outclasses the
rest. Champion Bell will haye to be at
his best to retain his title. Percy Mur
dock and Drummond MacGavln will be
the mainstay of. the north. A great
deal is expected of Hunt, but he has
not played here for . nearly, two years
and little Is known of his game. He
must have improved considerably,
however, to beat .Waldner.
From the southern part of the State
Champion Bell and Fritz Overton will
make a strong combination.
If Sumner Hardy elects to play he
would' probably win the championship.
In doubles, however, he and his broth
er would not have such a sure thing.
MacGavin and Murdock and Bell and
Overton would be hard men for the
Hardys to beat.
The Golden Gate Tennis, Club has

The Joint endurance run to be held
by the automobile clubs of California
and of Southern California is expected,
according to the present arrangements,
to begin on "Wednesday, September 14.
In some of the towns along the route
it Is not possible to purchase gasoline
on a Sunday, and the present arrange
ment involves no traveling on that
day. The cars from San Francisco will
reach IÂ«os Angeles on Saturday, Sep
tember 17. The automobi lists will
spend Sunday and Monday, September

of the Automobile Club of Southern
California. On Tuesday, September "0
the San Francisco motorists will start
on their homeward trip, being accom
pained by the Los Angeles automcbil-

California will stop In San Francisco
as the guests of the Automobile Club of
California Saturday and Sunday Ser>

and conditions of the event having
been published In the Eastern periodi
cals.
The programme of races to take place
under the management of the Automo
bile Club of California at Del Monte on
the 26th and 27th inst. is ready for the
printer, a little uncertainty about some
details having prevented its being put
into type sooner.
A circular has been sent to the mem
bers of the club showing the rates for
hotel accommodation and gasoline that
will be charged during the meet. The
inquiry for rooms at the Hotel del
Monte has been so great that a full
house is expected. All the members
who Intend to go down for the races,
whether as contestants or spectators,
are requested to inform the executive
committee of the number of their
party, whether they will journey to
Del Monte by the railroad or on motor
<^r, or will themselves travel by rail
shipping an automobile for use during
the meet.
The United States statute regarding
the conveyance of automobiles on ferry
boats carrying: passengers permits ma
chines to be carried If any fire or
flame about them is extinguished be
fore they are placed on the ferry-boat.
The gasoline in the regular tank may
be carried, but no additional supply is
permitted. In passing off the ferry

enthusiastic golfer. He was largely
instrumental in securing the Braid
Hills as a public course for Edinburgh,
being the mover of the principal reso
lution at a meeting convened in Edin
burgh in 1SS5 to consider the matter.
He played on some of the courses near
London and presented the Shand
medal, which Is competed for annually
on the Biarritz links. On the famous
Musselburgh course a bunker bears the
name of "Shand," but whether it ac
quired this title from the frequency of
his lordship's visits to it is not cer
tain.
Among the competitors for the Del

An estimate has been mede of the
number of golf courses in Great
Britain and Ireland. The figures are
only approximate and are said to be
rather- under than over the mark.
There are many private courses and
some club links that are not included.
There are more than one thousand
courses in the United. Kingdom, about
330 of them being of eighteen holes.
The total male membership of the golf
clubs is nearly 170,000. The golfers play
over 89,200 acres of land and pay rent
amounting to about $400,000 per an
num.
The annual tournament of the Pacific
Coast Golf Association will be held at
Del Monte next week, beginning on
Thursday and lasting as many day3
as may be rendered necessary by the
number of entries. On the first day
there will be an open event, which may
be entered by amateur or professional
players, for which prizes in # mcney.
amounting at least to fifty dollars ani
probably to a larger sum, will be
awarded to the professionals. Tin
competition will be over thirty-six
holes, medal play, eighteen being play
ed in the morning and the remaining
eighteen in the afternoon. Entries
should be made at the Hotel del Monta
not later than the 17th inst.
The fourth annual competitions for
the open championship and tna
women's championship of the Pacific

cipal contests of the tournament. The
competitions will be at match play, if
thÂ© number of entries is not so large
as to preclude this manner of deciding

As the Alameda senior barge crew, of
which Fred Avers was stroke and
which visited Astoria several-times, is
broken up and the club has no four
oared shell, there will be no Alameda
representatives at Astoria this year.
The Ariel Rowing Club will have se
nior and Junior barge crews in the re
gatta to be held on Lake Merritt on
Admission day, and will also enter a
crew in the four-oared shell race. The
shell crew will be made up of Charles
"Wilson, bow; E. J. Lynch, No. 2; E.
Smith, No. 3, and W. Howe, stroke.
Other crews to take part In the shell
race may come from Vallejo and the
University of California.
It is almost certain there will be no
representatives of San Francisco Bay
rowing clubs at the annual regatta and
aquatic carnival to be held at Astoria
at the end of this month. The commit
tee In charge of the rowing events does
not wish to have four-oared barge
races, and the California rowing clubs
have no xour-oared shell crews to send.
The Ariel Rowing Club has a four
oared shell that has been redecked and
fitted with new sliding seats and swivel
oarlocks. It was intended to send a
crew to Astoria, but it was found the
men would not have sufficient time to
practice in the new craft and learn to
sit it to the best advantage. So it was
decided to stay away from the Astoria'
regatta this year and endeavor to make
a good contest in 1905 at the northern
carnival.

I.OS AN.GELES. Â¦ Aug. 12. â The
game between Oakland and Los An
geles to-day was one of the most ex
citing played here for many weeks.
There were men on bases in almost
every inning Â¦ and several times vthe
bases were full, but neither side could
score until the eighth, when Los An
gelas managed to get the run that
won the game. It looked bad for the
locals in the ninth when a hit, a base
on balls and an error filled the bases
with no one out. A lightning double
play retired two men and a splendid
stop V-- Chase of a line drive ended
the game. Score:

A DOUBLE-HEADER
Andy Gallagher, who has boxed with
Munroe from the day he | commenced
training, is the most enthusiastic of his
supporters. "I have seen many boxers
in my time," said Gallagher yesterday,
"but I never saw one who has Im
proved as has Munroe. It seems he has
thoroughly mastered the rudiments of
the game in the past three months and
is now applying them in his work.
"He absorbs boxing tricks as a
sponge absorbs water, apparently hav
ing no difficulty in mastering any little
point, once It is pointed out to him."
Munroe's face is taking on a lean
look, but there is health in the skin and
a sparkle In the eyes. He is the em
bodiment of good nature, nothing ruf
fling his temper.
s That Munroe's excellent showing on
Thursday was not mere chance was
apparent yesterday when he showed
still greater improvement. He has com
menced to hit cleverly in the clinches
and in the breakaways and there is
force in all the blows. He caught Andy
Gallagher a short left swing on the Jaw
as they were Just getting into a clinch
before Gallagher could land. The blow
dazed the big Olympian, who fell for
ward on Munroe. ,
Jack used larger gloves than usual
yesterday, but the sting was there.
After the boxing there was a seance
with the medicine ball and then a dip
in the ocean.
Jack Munroe has certainly struck his
gait at last. Whether it Is the perfec
tion of condition into which he is rapid
ly rounding under the watchful eyes of
Tim McGrath or from some cause that
does not appear on the surface, the
miner is no longer a subject for ridicule
as a boxer.
The members of the training camp
are awaiting with much curiosity the
first training bout between Kid McCoy
and Munroe. It is predicted the
Hoosier boxer's eyes will pop out of his
head when he notes the improvement
which has taken place since he last
saw the man from Butte. It stands out
plainly before the novice in boxing, so
it will be much more in evidence to the
redoubtable Kid. .
Spectators Think He Does
Not Try With Nance O'Neil,
but He Is Exonerated

The Stadium at Harvard University,
which will seat 30,000 persons. Is prac
tically completed. It Is situated on the
ground used for the field athletics of
Harvard. The class of '79, of which
T. C. Frledlander of this city was ona
of the members, defrayed the cost- The
erection of the Stadium was decided
upon at the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the graduation of the class. The ac
companying- picture was received by
Mr. Frledlander. It is the first that
has come to San Francisco. The cost
of the Stadium was $125,000. The ma
terial used in construction la cement.
This insures durability. The field on
which the Stadium stands includes

-.Anderson lost his head and threw to
third, but failed to nail Williams, leav
ing both runners safe. Mohler forced
Williams at the pan on a hit to Hildff
brand, and the latter fumbled Dele
hanty's easy one and booted It out into
left field. Van Haltren sneaked in from
â¢wecond on the play, scoring the first
run of the day.
After two had perished. Hall threw
badly to first and gave Waldron a life.
Waldy stole and Hildebrand hit to
Hall. This time he fielded the ball per
fectly, hut Blankenship dropped the
throw and V/aldron came in with the
one that tangled up the result.
Seattle had the game apparently
broken up in the nintn round, when
Mohler led off with a drive to right
field, followed by Frisk's single and a
base on balls to Blajikenship. The
bases were filled and only one out. Bar

Barber gained another brilliant vic
tory and demonstrated he has the Si
washes on his staff. Strangely enough
it Vas an error that gave Seattle its
only run. AVith one to the bad in the
sixth, Williams drove a three-bagger
to the score. Van Haltren put the ball
down to Anderson and Williams start
ed for the pan, but stopped and ran
back to third after proceeding a few
feet.,
Meany, the first man up in the ninth
inning, was passed. "Van Buren lined
the ball Into Hall's territory, but the
shortstop got his dope crossed and ran
for second base, while the ball sped
into left field. Towneend laid down a
bunt to Blankenship. He picked up
the ball and threw, to third. The toss
was a bad one and Meany tore home
with the winning run.
The excitement and strain that pre
vailed throughout the great baseball
battle yesterday at Recreation Park
finally wore down . Blankenship and
Russ Hall. Both made mistakes in the
ninth- inning that broke up the game
and grave San Francisco a victory by a
Kcore of 2 to 1.

'was much regret expressed by the pub
lic to-day when they saw the famous i
tVaterboy beaten in a one and one '
quarter mile handicap with Odom in
the saddle. It seems idle to expect the
â¢hce great race horse to run a first
class race, or even a seco-nd-class one.
L>oth Eugenia Burch and Hello finished
in front of him. Many thought Eu
Â«enia Burch interfered with Hello dur
irjjf the whole of the last furlong. Hil-
Ctbrand lodged a complaint with the
stewards, but they did not think the
matter justified disqualification.
William Lakeland's Gold Ten, with
Hildebraud in the saddle, got off In
front in the fourth race, the Troy Sell
ing stakes, and this won her the race.
Trapper was heavily played, but ran
a poor race. "Joe" Yeager was the
principal winner on Gold Ten.
Andrew Miller's Divination won the
fifth race, defeating Go Between,
which was played by all the big bet
tors at the track, George Rose of San
â¢Francisco laying John A. Drake $6000
to $5000. All the heavy speculators at
the track wagered large sums on the
lest race, the bookmakers claiming it
was one of the best betting races of
the meeting. Saulsbury, which al
ways warms up like a wild colt, was
backed from 30 down to S to 1. Bank's
odds were cut from 20 down to 12. The

young man well known In the mercan

under circumstances that have caused
his friends to enlist the aid of the po
lice. Waley was last seen on Sunday
afternoon, since which time none of his
friends have received any tidings of
the missing man. When his room at
the Pacific House was searched to-day
it was discovered that nearly all his ef
fects had been removed. The only ar
ticles found were a pair of trousers,
some underclothing and a colored shirt,
the Bleeves and bosom of which are
badly stained with blood. There was
nothing In the room that would throw
any light on the mystery.
Waley was formerly a partner in the,
firm 'of Whipple & Waley, conducting
an upholstering business _at 1036 Sev
enth street. At the time of his disap
pearance he was employed at the Cur
tain Store at Fourteenth and Franklin
streets. His employers say his work
was entirely satisfactory, and that he
had had no business troubles, so far as
they know. The proprietor of the Pa
cillc House says that Waley's rent Is
paid up until to-morrow night. v
The missing man is 23 years of age
and unmarried.

PERSON'AL.
J. S. Nicholas, residing at 1216 East
Twenty-first street, has taken the first
step toward again testing the law in
regard to the compulsory vaccination
of children. Nicholas has demanded
that two of his offspring, who have not
been subjected to the operation, be per
mitted to attend the public school.
In fact he sent his boys to the i5wett
school and ordered them to stay there,
unless they were forcibly ejected. The
school teachers were unwilling to use
violence and the children remained.
Though they sit In a classroom they
are not enrolled as pupils and their
status on the school records is that of
visitors.
Nicholas' children are not receiving
the benefits of instruction and the fa
ther Insists that they are entitled to be
taught. On the other hand, thp school
department authorities are compelled
to call the parents' attention to the fact
that an act of the Legislature incorpor
ated in the statutes of California and
thrice affirmed by the Supreme Court
as constitutional obliges the depart
ment to enforce the vaccination law.
Nicholas invites the school depart
ment to eject his children, so he may
be given a chance to test the much
tested law.
In furtherance of a movement Inaug
urated in Berkeley by Dr. W. Allen,
president of the Berkeley Board of Ed
ucation, to procure the repeal of the
compulsory vaccination law, a mass
meeting of Oakland citizens will be
held Monday night at Hamilton hall.
Thirteenth and Jefferson streets. Dr.
Allen, the Rev. J. Stitt Wilson and
others interested in the subject will
speak.
The purpose of the meeting is to state
objections to the compulsory feature of
the law, which requires pupils of the
public schools to be vaccinated.
Petitions are in circulation asking the
repeal of the act by the next Legis
lature.

Rev. John D. Maguire, professor of
Latin philology in the Catholic Uni
versity, Washington. D. C. preached
last night at St. Mary's Cathedral in
the novena now being conducted in
the church, which will close Monday
night.
Dr. Maguire Baid that each age has
its own particular sins and tempta
tions and as civilization progresses
from the less to the more complex the
relations that exist between man and
man and between man and God are
in danger of more and greater con
fusion. Dr. Maguire dwelt on the
importance of scanning closely the
wants of the age to the end that these
relations may be readjusted and prop
er remedies applied.
The great needs of the age, he ad
vised, are first, faith, or an apprecia
tion of the relations between Creator
and creature, and secondly, honesty,
or an appreciation of the relations of
man to his fellow man. *
The doctor said that the second
need of the age Is that of honesty.
He asked his hearers to look around
and see the weak crushed; see the
fearful struggle for existence; hear
the cry o% the million for bread, and
see the few entrenched In power.

The Kirklands had been living in a
house at 1424 San Pablo avenue, from
vhich they were ejected a few days
&Â£o. The owner of the property paid for
the removal of the couple's belongings.
For several months the place had
bt-en occupied by the Kirklands, when
It was formerly the residence of Mr.
*,nd Mrs. J. H. Mooney. the latter being
the old lady's sister. Mooney died and
the widow moved away, leaving the old
j-eople as tenants. They were unable
ta pay the rent and the owner had
found a new tenant, not knowing his
house had been occupied after Mooney
departed.
Attention of the authorities has been
called to the Kirklands' condition.
Friendless, penniless, homeless and
decrepit, aged James Klrkland, a crip
ple, and his feeble wife, have been
camped in a vacant lot at Adeline and
Twenty-fourth streets, their few mea
ger belongings piled about them for
shelter.

To avoid coming in conflict with the
marriage laws of a German colony on
the west coast of Africa, J.Iiss Laura
G. Mosher of Berkeley and Dr. Silas F.
Johnson of Los Angeles were married
on the Atlantic Ocean some day within
the present week, somewhere beyond
the three-mile limit. Just what day
the nuptials were celebrated, who per
formed the marriage ceremony and
where the young people got their mar
riage license are questions the parents
of the bride are not yet prepared to an
swer, for they haven't heard the news
themselves. Ali the anxious father
and mother do know is that the inter
esting ceremony was due to take place
within these last seven days, when the
steamer, with its uncertain travel,
would carry their daughter to the wait
ins bridegroom.
The bride is the daughter of the Rev.
and Mrs. W. C. Mosher of 2904 Harper
street, late of Los Angeles. She was
graduated from the University of Cali
fornia last year and has since been en
gaged in missionary training work in
Los Angeles.
In the course of her duties there Miss
Mosher met Dr. Johnson, a missionary,
home on a furlough from Africa. Their
work drew them together . often and
the result was an engagement and a
determination on the part of Miss
Mosher to devote her life to the
heathen.
But Dr. Johnson was not prepared
to take a bride with him, nor did he
have time to wait for a wedding cere
mony. So the young people agreed that
she should follow when the proper ar
rangements were made. And in ac
cordance with this plan Miss Mosher
departed a month ago for Batangas, a
roast town in the German colony of
Kamarum, where German laws are
even more stringent than in any other
part ofthe German empire. The great
est hardship, however, lies in that they
require a residence of six months before
a marriage will be legal. This, of
course, was too lofts a time for the
young missionaries to wait, so they hit
upon a way to avoid the laws.
The plan was simple. The groom met
the bride on the high seas, where tht.
wedding ceremony was performed.

By a trust provision the estate was to
be managed by Thomas H. West and
the income to go to Mrs. Helen E.
Pierce and Mrs. Luelen T. Gardner for
their support during their life time, and
in case of need the estate could be sold
and the money given them. By the
contention of attorney for the contest
ant, his client has alprior claim by the
right of descent and he asks that the
will be set aside and the property dis
tributed to the grandson of deceased.
Lillian D. Kellogg has asked the
court to set aside the will of her grand
mother, Eliza D. Atwill, on the ground
that she was not mentioned in the will
nor left a part of the estate. She claims
that she is entitled to a one-fourth
share of $15,300, which she says is the
amount her mother would have re
ceived had she been alive. Mary J.
Plnkerton, Sarah A. Keith and Lime
line A. Bloomer, the three sisters of the
deceased woman, who were left the
estate, claim that their niece already
has recelve-i an amount equivalent to
one-fourth of the estate. Deceased was
SS years of age at the time of her death,
'and, it is claimed by the grand
daughter, was forgetful.
Two contests over the estates of de
ceased women were filed In the Probate
Court to-day. Owing to a trust clause
in the will of the late Adeline M. Sayle,
containing provisions which it is
claimed fall directly within the ruling
of the Supreme Court in the famous
Fair will contest, in which the trust
was declared invalid, the attorney for
Guthrie Sayle Courvoisier, a minor heir
and grandson of deceased, expects to
gain the entire estate for his client,
amounting to $6091 80.

While not wishing to dictate or even sug
gest your action, or urge or Insist upon a con
ference and belns: very solicitous for harmony
between the two districts In this aa In other
matters of common Interest, our board has
not as yet seen sufficient reason for receding
from the position which it has taken, although
your board has taken a different one, and
when ii similar application for a conference was
made to us by th* cities of San Francisco.
Oakland Alameda and Berkeley, our board,
on Aueust 3. passed a resolution substantially
the same, except the necessary changes to that
above recited.
This communication Is made solely to advise
ycu of the facts and to have them appear of
record and not with any wish to Influence your
action.' or to In any way appear as advocating
any particular course of action In the prem
ises. Yours respectfully, P. J. HAZEN.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 12.â Joseph F. For
derer, Â©resident of. the Board of Trus
tees of this city and chairman of the
joint committee of San Francisco, Oak
land, Alameda and Berkeley is in re
ceipt of a letter from P. J. Hazen, at
torney for the Turlock Irrigation dis
trict, advising him of the fact that the
Modesto irrigation district has refused
to appoint a committee to confer with
the joint committee with a view of ob
taining a better water supply for the
bay cities. This decision on the part of
the Modesto board practically kills the
proposition so far as that source of
supply is concerned.
The Turlock board, on the other
hand, seemed inclined to hear more of
the proposition and at the same time
keep in harmony with the Modesto
board.
Chairman P. J. Hazen of the Turlock,
in a communication to President For
derer conveying the Turlock districts
formally expressed views, says:
This resolution was in line with a policy
adoptÂ«d and pursued by the representatives
of the two districts and others working in their
Interests, after mature consideration, as beinit
the wisest position for us to assume and occupy
Tor the protection of the rights and privileges
of the districts in the water of our common
source of supply. That policy Involves the
assertion on our part of a desire to be fair,
reasonable and broad minded In 'This matter,
and It also involves a deÂ»irÂ« for harmonious
action between th* two districts. That resolu
tion would probably not have been proposed
or adopted had It not been. understood that it
was In" harmony with your views. Our position
regarding these waur rights and privileges is
a very strong one. and we believe that It will
be materially weakened by abandonment of
that position. There Is not, never has been or
ever will be, in my opinion, any serious danger
of our rights being materially injured by San
Francisco, or any. or all of the "bay cities,
unless we are negligent or act unwisely.

The Spartan arrived here yesterday
in command of Mate Holmstrom,
twelve days from Eellingham. with
1.060,000 feet of lumber lor cargo.
On board the shop, a passenger, was
Ferem's nine-year-oid son. Captain
.IVrem is raid to have consumed con
siderable liquor during the time his
ship was on the sound, but his officers
say he was sober when he Jumped into
the sea. The ship was four days out
from Dellinyham when he committed
suicide, and Feiem had touched no in
toxicants during the voyage.
He cams on deck about 7 o'clock the
mornins of August 5 and joined his
son and Mate .Holmstrom on the quar
terdeck. He appeared to be much as
usual and in good spirits. Suddenly he
walked quickly to the rail, glanced
aloft and seemed about to give some
order. Without saying a word, how
fever, he climbed the rail and leaped
lnxo the sea.
The shiD was hove to, a boat lowered
end within fifteen n;inutes the Spar
tau's sailors were pulling the dripping

Further, frcm the evidence taken In this
caw, we are of- the" opinion that there waa
considerable Indulgence In intoxicating lkiuor
on tho part of #ome of the licensed officers
of the rteamshlp Colon while lying at anchor
off San Jofe de Guntemala on the night of
April 0 laK, and that the enrlneere ware
present at the time, the occasion belnc the
murrlaue of Chief Officer J. Wilson, which
took, place on board the Colon that same"even
ing. Toartlnc the health of the bride and
Kruom by most of the officers and part of the
crew of tho t;tes.msh!p Colon was going on in
llarry Stevens' room at the expenee of
Chief Officer J. Wilson. Mr. Stevens, the
storekeeper, averred that he wan ordered to
open wine fr>r them by the chief officer. Mr.
Wilson. He also testified that 33 quart bottles
of chair.pagr.e. 6 bottlea of whisky and a num
ber of bottles' of ginger ale were opened and
consumed In his room between tho hours of
b:SO p. m.. April iÂ». and 2 a. m., April 10,
last. Mr. Stevens also averred that Messrs.
William D. E. Sullivan, chief engineer; M. IÂ».
Rulllvan.flrstj assistant; J. M. Campbell, sec
ond aisistsnt, and Daniel Farley, third aÂ»-
Mstant. were on that occasion under the in
fluence' of llc'Jor.
We are\ Inclined to .creHlt the evidence of
Mr. Stevens, though not* corroborated by any
ether wltneÂ»Â«es. for the reason that when the
engineers and others were- afforded the oppor
tunity to have Mr. - Stevens present at the
final hearlns to question him In regard to hi*
testimony given. â¢ and to his sworn affidavit
afterward tent to this c.fflee, they declined to
avail then-pelves of the opportunity so given.
Also for the reason that Mr. Wilson, chief of
ficer tit the Colon at that time, admits that
he paid J'H 50 for wines and liquors issued on
that occasion.
CHAMPAGNE FLOWS FSEELY.
After a careful consideration of the evidence
in the ca*c we find that J. Wilson, chief mate
of ihe steamship Colon, was truilty of misbe
havior on the night of April 9, lttoi. In giving
Instructions to the storekeeper, H. G. Stevens,
to furnh-h Kqucts anil beer to the officers and
crew of said versel; for not stopping the store
keeper lrom giving out any more liquor when
thoee ores? nt In I the room had become some
what .under Jts .influence; - .for Â¦ hlÂ» par
ticipation in drinking with the Ucena?d officers,
and for not Inforrrlng the master of the vessel
of thi condition of things then J existing on
board, especially as the steamer was lying
In an open roadstead under steam and might
have put to sea on short notice.
The value of the steamship was es
timated at $150,000, and that of the
cargo at $60,000, part of which was
landed safely.. The annexad quota
tions from the findings explain the
reasons that.actuated the inspectors:
Had Captain Irvine takrn a caat of the lead
when he came on the bridge at 4:52 a. m., or
stopped the ship and watted for daylight, aÂ»
a more careful maet*r would have done. It
would have shown him the position of the ves
sel. Certain Irvine Â«eyn his reckoning: of tho
position oi the steamer on this morning was
based entirtly on the vetbal order of forty
seven revolutJcna or the engines per minute,
which he Ka.\>; to the chief engineer while ly
ing at San Jcse de Guatemala. He testified
that he did not at any time Â«ee that hlÂ» or
der was obeyed In regard to the revolutions;
that he diu not take any acccunt of the dis
tance run from San Jose by the log-, find that
he did net place any reliance In the report
of tho third mate. Mr. Taylor, as to the dis
tance the steamer was from the liKht at 4:52
a. m.. as he had no confidence In Mr. Tay
lor's ability. By his own reckoning the vessel
was TVi tÂ° "% miles frcm the beach.
After* 'a careful consideration of the testi
mony taken in this case we ilnd that Captain
William A. Irvine was negligent and unskillful
in navigating the steamship Colon on April 11,
1904, in trusting altocether to a verbal order
given to Â«'h!ef Engineer William D. E. Sul
livan two and a half hours before the steamer
left Â£an Jcse de Guatemala, and In not tak
ing rr.ca?ures to ascertain after tho uteanier
was und^r' way that such order had been com
plied with; especially, as he allege*, he* thought
Mr. Sullivan wos.under the influence of liquor
at thÂ« time he rave him the order to make
forty-seven revolutions. Also In not taking
account of the distance the steamer had run
by the log from Ran Jcse de Guatemala at
4:52 a. rr... and in disregarding 1 the report of
the third mate. Mr. Taylor, which was given
to him at that time, as to the- distance the
steamer was from the light, by not taking
soundings or stopping the &hlp until daylight,
as he should have done under the circum
etr.ncey.
CAPTAIN' IRVINE BLAMED.
United States Local â¢ Inspectors
Bolles and Bulger rendered a decision
late yesterday afternoon in the matter
of the wreck of the steamship Colon
on Remedios Reef on the coast of Sal
vador April 11, 1904. Captain Wil
liam A. Irvine, master of â¢ the steam
ship, was adjudged guilty of. negli
gence and unskillfulness and his li
cense as master and pilot was sus
pended for twelve months. The li
cense of J. Wilson -as chief mate was
suspended fÂ° r four months. Third
Mate J. W. -Taylor was exonerated
from all blame. .The license of Wil
liam D. E. Sullivan as chief engineer
was suspended for four" months, and
those of" M. D. Sullivan, J. M. Camp
bell and Daniel Farley, assistant en
gineers, were suspended for ninety
days. ,
Chief Sullivan Is Disrated
for Four Months and His
Men Suspended for Three
Max R. Ettinger, whose son Wil
liam is before Judge Fritz on a charge
of burglary, has filed with the court
an affidavit setting forth that since
childhood the defendant has been a
somnambulist and has frequently
wandered away from his home while
fast asleep. When he. was between
three and four years of age. it is
averred, the boy was missed from his
cot and found asleep in a clothes bas
ket,, and often after that he was dis
covered slumbering in various parts
of the house to which he had gone
from his bed while he was sleeping.
While on a fishing excursion with hia
father the lad often repeated his som
nambulistic performances and the
night following the day of his moth
er's death, May 30, 1898, he wandered
to a vacant' lot at Sutter and Webster
streets, where he was wrapped in
slumber when found by a searching
party. These statements the court is
asked to take into" consideration with
the charge against young Ettinger.
It was on the night of July 13 that
the alleged sleep-walker was discov
ered under the bed of A. C. Leider. a
mail carrier, at 333 Eddy street, and
since then the case has been dragging
before Judge Fritz.
Charles A. Landis, ex-policeman,
charged with battery upon his broth

N. O. Hart, accused of stealing a,
blanket from a horse, told Judge
Fritz how it came to pass. Covered by
his own blanket, Mr. Hart said, he
was slumbering upon the aand of a
vacant lot south of. Market street
when some unscrupulous thief pur
loined his covering. He was awak
ened by the chill morning fog pene
trating his system and if he had not
right there and then enveloped him
self in the blanket which he found
upon the horse the consequences to
his health would surely have been
most serious, as he was of fragile
physical constitution and peculiarly
susceptible to colds. He hoped hia
sentence would be a light one and the
court informed him that it would,
provided no previous larcenies are
raked up to confront him when he re
appears before the tribunal to-day.

'With hiÂ» trousers and shoes utilized
as a pillow, ;D.,Pukeiza, recently from
the realm of the : Czar, was '. soundly
slumbering upon, a bench"; in' Union
square when the, policeman found
him. But his nether limbs were fully
clad as he stood before Judge Ca
baniss : and > pleaded .poverty. .
. "You are able bodied :â¢ and active,"
said his Honor, ."and 'the;horticultur
iÂ«ts! are clamoring for men to harvest
their fruit. For failing to respond to
"How io?" inquired Judge Fritz. -
"HI'm hunder the protection hof the

"hand Hengland daon't hallow 'er sub
jects to be wrongfully, himprisoned in
a furrin' land. Hi wasn't drunk w'en

â¢Ave a care, sir, 'ave a care."
"At the risk of fracturing the en
tente cordiale between two mighty na
tions and steeping them In sanguinary
conflict, *â¢ must send you to Jail for
thirtv days,"j said the Judge, severely.
"You'll 'ear from the Consul, hand
that bloomin'. soon." quoth Mrs.
Brown. "Then wat'll yer do?"
â¢ "I'll inform him^that if he gave you
money to purchase food you betrayed
his trust by buying beer," replied the
court. /
- " 'Ave a care, sir, .'ave .a care," was
Mrs. Brown's farewell warning.
"'Ave a care, sir, 'ave a care," said
Mrs. Annie Brown, "for hlf you Bends
me to Joil you'll bring a 'eap of trouble
hupon your hown 'ead."
For every dollar of the six he was
accused of stealing,' Frank Tiernan
will serve a month In the County Jail.
The case was heard by Judge Cabaniss
and the complaining witness was Mrs.
Abbie Tully of 25 Ritch street. She was
reluctant to prosecute, because the
man was making a sociable call at her
residence when the money was stolen.
After his -Honor had complimented
Mrs. Tully as the "most artistic for
getter" that had ever appeared before
him. her twelve-year-old daughter was
called to the stand and testified so
strongly that the defendant pleaded
guilty. Mr*. Tully. seemed to be more
grieved by Mr. Tlernan's breach of so
cial etiqu<**ie than by her loss of the
six dollars. :
Ah Yen was employed as' cook by
Mrs. E. V. Smith of 2175 Pacific ave
nue when he stole her purse, contain
ing $19, two bottles of champagne and
one bottle of whisky. The intrinsic
value of the plunder caused Mrs.
Smith less distress than did her de
privation of the purse, which she
prized highly as a memento, and Judge
Conlan informed the defendant that if
the cash holder is not restored to its
owner before noon tc-day the sentence
imposed will be the maximum for petty
larceny. Yen declares that he does
not know what became of the purse.
In the court at Judge Fritz the. Joke
of the day was sprung from the bench.
Jerome O'Connor, against whom were
two distinct charges of stealing clocks
from Chinese laundries, waa asked by
his Honor why he took so much time.
When the resultant laugh faded out
the case was continued.
John Coyne, chronic vagrant, was
sentenced to four months' imprison
ment after he had declared with em
phasis that Judge Cabaniss would
make the error of his life by convict
ing him.
"Your plea is spurious, Coyne," said,
his Honor and Clerk "Barney" Conlan
was the only person present who seem
ed to fully grasp the pun.
A. W. Lloyd and his stepdaughter
are inmates of Mrs. A. D. Thompson's
select boarding-house, 225 Eighth
street, and Mrs.. Thompson avers that
whenever the young woman had a
"tiff" with a sister-boarder she enlisted
the aid- of her stepparent to harass
and annc-y the enemy. On the most
recent of these occasions Mr. Lloyd
primed himself with l>eer, conveyed in
a can, until he imagined himself to be
a duck and while thus hallucinated he
ran through the halls and corridors,
loudly quacking and flapping his arms
as if they " \v6re . wings, to the great
distress of Mrs. Thompson and the
mingled amusement ana fright of sev
eral other women. Mrs. Thompson al
leges, furthermore, that Mr. Lloyd has
been rather neglectful in* the matter
of paying his rent.
Judge Conlan continued his hearing
of the peace disturbance charge against
Mr. Lloyd and nobody in court paid
the least attention to Clerk "Jack"
Rice's perfectly audible bon mot, that
when a man habitually "chases the
duck" it should not be surprising if
the bird finally, finds incarnation in its
pursuer.
Joseph Athman, Joseph Gullleumore
and Mary Molliet, natives of France,
boarded an electric car at Kentucky
street and Fifteenth avenue South last
Sunday evening and a few minutes
later they were fiercely battling witn
Motorman Patrick McNally and Con
ductor John Hennessey. When the
conflict was quelled by Patrolmen Mc-
Soley and Flynn the head of M. Ath
man bore several deep lacerations in
flicted with iron implements wielded
by the carmen and M. Guilleumore's
cranium was also rather badly dam
aged by the same weapons. To add to
their discomfiture MM. Athman and
Guilleumore and Madame Molliet were
arrested and charged with disturbing
the peace.
-When the case was called before
Police Judge Cabaniss yesterday
morning Motorneer McNally testified
that it was'M. Athman who started
the rumpus. Irritated by the slow
progress made by the car, M. Athman
petulantly chided Mr. McNally and
then in his impulsive Gallic way in
vaded that portion of the vehicle re
served for the exclusive occupancy of
the man at the lever. When requested
to withdraw he struck Mr. McNally,
and while that gentleman was re
taliating in kind M. Guilleumore went
to his iriend's assistance and the team
was making things very interesting for
the motorneer when Conductor Hen
nessey butted in and evened up the
odds. The carmen, armed with iron
bars, were getting much the best of
the affray when Madame Molliet
butted in and lacerated the conduc
tor's facial cuticle with her finer nails,
whereupon a passenger named Alex
ander Simon butted in and again even
ed the odds by tackling Madame Mol
liet. It was a six-handed affair when
the policemen arrived.
"This case is unique," said the
Judge, when he had heard all the con
flicting testimony, "in the fact, disputed
by nobody, that the woman did not get
the men into trouble, but was dragged
into it herself by the men, whereas
the direct contrary is the almost in
variable rule. In view of this remark
able phase I will dismiss the charge
against Madame Molliet and fine each
of the other defendants 55. I would
impose a heavier fine if the heads of
MM; Athman and Guilleumore had
been more lightly battered."

DRAW POKERâ A. P. P.. Alameda,
Cal. In the game of draw poker the
eldest hand has the privilege of making
a bet before the cards are called to be
dealt. Thi3 bet Is usually limited to a
few chips and Is called "going blind."
The blind may be doubled by the player
to the left of the eldest hand, and the
next player to the left may at his op
tion straddle this bet, and so on, in
cluding the dealer. The age or aldest
hand alone ha9 the privilege of starting
the blind, and if he does any player re
fustng to straddle debars those after
him from dolns so. When the age de
clines to go blind he is sometimes per
mitted to delegate his privilege to the
next player; this, however, must be
agreed upon previous to beginning the
game. By eldest hand or age Is meant

happiness without a flaw it is difficult to suggest what
would be for the dusky prisoner.

Evidence of Cleanliness.
"When the late ex-Speaker Thomas B.
Reed was in California, says the
Youth's Companion, he visited the Lick
Observatory, on Mount Hamilton. It
was a wonderful November day, full of
gold and the bloom of flowers. Mr.
Reed looked down at the gorgeous
landscape 4000 feet below, and,' turning
to one of his hosts, said:
"Colonel, this looks too much like a
special display got up in honor of the
occasion. Tell me what a. typical win
ter day in California Is really like."
The Californian thought at once of a
day in February, so warm that after
a morning bath he had lain in a ham
mock outdoors, smelted the roses on the
trellis and listened to the trill of the
meadowlark among the almond blooms.
He. began to describe it eloquently:
"Thirteen years ago. on February 22, I
took a bath "
He paused to arrange his account of
the roses - and the ' meadowlark. Mr.
Reed broke the pause.
"Well, Colonel, he said, in admira
tion, "you do know something about
cleanliness out here, don't you?"
The newly elected President of the United States of
Colombia took his uneasy seat of office the other day,
and strange to relate in these days of political surprises,
absolute quiet marked the event. When the Colombians
can't be teased into at least a riot over the induction of a
new chief executive we must conclude that national spirit
is sadly lacking in that hysterical vigor which makes
these volatile. South Americans so picturesque.
School for Burglars.
It bu Ions been known that the
modern thief or burglar trains chil
dren very carefully for nefarious work.
Only the other day a trainer of young
was sent to'prison, and such'
cases are continually cropping up.
Most Ingenious are the methods
practiced by "prof essionals" to ' teach
their pupils the art of burglary. Mere
youngsters make excellent subjects;
and as It Is obviously of importance
not to make a noise when "burgling,"
the lads are now taught to slide face
downward on the balustrade. It has
been discovered that, in order to ao
custom them to this mode of descent,
special spiral -shaped balustrades' are
sometimes constructed, and before the
pupil Is pronounced "finished" he must
be able to slide down a variety of
these balustrades "like greased light
ning."
Another common practice among
the "burgling" fraternity is that of
getting orders to view empty houses
f rofil various house agents. A num
ber of clever burglaries are worked
this tray. Dressed up as a country
squire, the "master" visits numbers
of house agents, gets orders to view
certain houses, generally In terraces,
a? there, if he has a plan of the
interior of one house, he has a "key"
to the whole terrace.
He accordingly looks over the
house, gets a plan of the Interior, and
<;uits. A few days afterward his
pupils enter the empty - house, and
making their way along the roofs,
enter whichever house has been, se
lected. In the meantime the ;-"squire"
latrols the house outside, looking 're
rpectability personified, and when the
*;oast is clear he signals, usually: by
rtrlkinc matches,. so that the' boys In
side know. whether they can safely
come-out with the. spoil. One match
means "all's well"; two matches

Liberia's Nezv President.
The United States maintains a Min
ister to He is Rev. Ernest
Lyon, a Baltimore man. The other
day, Minister Lyon reports, Liberia sol
emnly inaugurated a new President
named Thomas Barclay. Liberia's con
stitution is easy and permits the coun
try to be governed by people born upon
foreign soil. Barclay came to Liberia
In early childhood from Barbadoes, in
the West Indies, and even as an infant
showed surprising ability in politics.
It is told of Barclay that, being with
his nurse and some other children near
his age one day, some candy was about
to be distributed, when It was discov
ered that there was one piece too -few
to go round. Whereat Tommy instant
ly had a magnanimous solution for the
problem. "Let the youngest be served
first," he said proudly, planting* his lit
tle hand upon his Infant bosom. But
when the candy came to be attacked it
was discovered that by a calculation of
incredible. rapidity Tommy had per
ceived that the youngest was himself.
Later on, when he had got to be Sec
retary of State, he performed the re
markable feat of maintaining a balance
in the treasury of the republic. For the
probity and skill thus shown a grateful
people made him President. And it is
safe to say that Liberia Is heartily and
unanimously, glad that Barclay has the
Job. For while there are only 25,000
English-speaking negroes In the coun
try, the rest of the population is com
posed of 1,500,000 native and savage
African blacks. Still Liberia, as little
republics go, is surprisingly well or
dered. For, while numerically small,
the descendents of the original settlers
from the United States are still su
preme in power. Revolutions are com
paratively few and business booms.

Back to Tmvn.
Back from my summer vacation.
In the noisy old town once more.
Away from the vicious .mosquitoes
And the chiggers that sting and bore.
With my neck all raw and blistered
Ana my nose as red as a beet,
I find that the city is welcome
And that life In town is sweet.
Back from my summer vacation.
Away from the worms that creep,
And the gnats that crawl down my neck-
band.
And bother me while I sleep.
Afar from the flies and the spiders
And the June bugs that biff and pelt,
I am glad to get back from the country
And the loneliness I have felt.
Back from my summer vacation.
And the soggy old stuff to eat.
Where a restaurant meal la a pleasure
And a table d'hote is a treat.
Where there's something to do besides
Sfcjjjfe grumble
And something to do besides wait.
Where I get my papers each morning
And they're never a whole day latÂ«.
Back from my summer vacation.
In the good old town once more.
Afar from the oppressive silence.
To the rush and the rout and roar.
In, the city there's something doing.
There's joy in the meet of might
And the soul expands with the struggle
And grows in the shock of fight.

might be called the Russell Sage of
England. In- fact lie is several years
older than the famous American finan
cier and confidently expects to cele
brate hie ninety-fourth birthday next
September. It was only a temporary
indisposition which caused him to be
absent the other day from the annual
meeting of the General Assurance
Company, of which he has been the
chairman for the last quarter of a cen
tury. He is head of the well known
London firm of Andrew Lusk & Co.,
but like many other men here, re
markable for intellectual vigor in cold
age, he was born in Scotland. As long
ego as IS73, when he was a. sprightly
fellow of sixty-three, he was elected
Lord Mayor of London and at the ex
piration of his term of office the usual
honor of knighthood was conferred
upon him. For , twenty yearsâ from
1865 to 1SSSâ he represented the
borough of Finsbury In Parliament. It
trill be recalled that Russell Sage was
for a brief period a member of Con
gress, but found that he could not at
tend to both business and politics at
the tune time. Sir Andrew, perhaps
because he was not quite eo anxious
to keep piling up more money than he
could spend, managed to do it. Un
like Russell Sage, too, he does occa

has never Indulged in the luxury of a

Social Revolution.
There has been probably no greater
social revolution In the last half cen
tury than that which has affected the
custom and circumstances of smoking.
Before the Crimean war. says the
London Express, no well-bred man
would think of being seen in the day
time in a fashionably frequented part
of London with a cigar in hia mouth.
Nowadays a fragrant Havana, if not
an emblem of aristocracy, is regarded
anyhow as a proof of means.
Twenty years ago a visitor in a
lady's drawing-room would as soon
have thought of spitting on the floor
as of puffing Turkish tobacco: to-day
it is an open question whether the
hostess or her guest is the first to have
recourse to the contents of a cigarette
case.
At the ponderous and protracted
banquets in vogue during part of the
last reign, to insult the "after din
ner claret." by the suggestion of
smoking would have constituted a far
graver offense than to undervalue the
champagne by diluting It with seltzer
water.
In these present days in private
houses, at regimental messes and even
at "festival" dinners, coffee and cigar
ettes trip up the heels of the "savory."
The other evening a distinguished for
eigner, as he complacently lighted a
mammoth cigar, said to his host: "On
the last occasion when I had the
honor of dining In this house I -was
your father's. guest, and he begged me
during dessert not to hesitate to go
into the square outside if I would like
to smoke; and, so far from being
taken aback by the suggestion. I con
sidered him a very liberal-minded man
for even recognizing such a require*
ment on my part."
MARIE CORELLI, the greatest living woman
writer, begins a powerful series of articles deal
ing with live topics of the social side of life
in The Sunday Call Magazine to-morrow, the first arti
cle being entitled "The % Decay of Hospitality." The
two succeeding articles will be entitled. "Why American
Girls Are Popular in England" and . "The Palm of
Beauty." No one could be better qualified by keen in
sight and long experience to discuss such matters in
a, thoroughly entertaining manner than lyfarie Corelli,
whose books have been translated into every written
language' and whose name is a household word through
out the civilized world. With the article to-morrow will
appear a fac-simile reproduction of a hitherto unpub
lished manuscript in the handwriting of the authoress
with her signature.
Another strong series, but in a lighter rein, which,
begins to-morrow, will be from the pen of the ever
popular Edward W. Townsend," the creator of the in
comparable Chimmie Fadden. The series by Mr. Town
send, who is one of the many successful writers of the
day whose early training was received in San Fran
cisco, wiirdeal with the chastening experiences of "Reu
ben From Beetville," who arrives in New York bur
dened with considerable more, money than sophistica
tion. The description of the various incidents tending
to bring these two prominent features more into equili
brium, makes amusing reading.
"Dr. Xavier" runs through the second of its four
installments. This story will be completed upon August
28, and will be followed by "Anna the Adventuress,"
by E. Phillips Oppenheim, the well-known English
writer. Other fiction features embrace a full-page story
by William Allen White; "The Homecoming of Colonel
Hucks," a charmingly told story of an old-fashioned
couple, with illustrations in three colors by J. A. Cahill;.
"Giovanni and the Princess," the leading story upon the
storiette page, and two storiettes, "The Letter Robert
Wrote" and "A Fool . and ; His Money."
In the women's section are three up-to-date pages of
fashion*: "What to Wear in the Fall Days," by Augusta
Prescott; "Unique Wedding Gifts for Brides," contain
ing hints on many odd but Very acceptable presents,
and a page on "Simple but Effective Portieres," by
Madge Moore. There is also a page on the philan
thropic work that Oakland women are doing,. and many
shorter articles and items.

Towns are springing up as if by magic in the Rose
bud reservation of South Dakota, where a vast area has
been opened by the Government for settlement. It is
unfortunate that the settlers,, sturdy of purpose and
honest "of intention, were not allowed more time before
the shadow of the municipality and its strange exactions
fell upon them. To flee from the city to help build an

tells an amusing story about a colored
girl named Lizzie Young, who was as
signed to her class.
It appears that Miss Blank, the
teacher, a few days after Lizzie came
to school reached the conclusion that
the colored girl, though nearly 18
! years of age, was not far enough ad
vanced to remain In the class to which
she had been assigned. This conclu
sion was forced upon the teacher after
she had examined Lizzie as to the
studies she had pursued before coming
to Los Angeles.
"Lizzie," said Miss Blank at the
opening of the examination, "what
books did you use?"
"Jes* like dese, ma'am," said Liz
zie, pointing to one of the California
State series.
Now Miss Blank knew that "books
Jes' like dese" were not found out of
California, and as Lizzie came from
Louisiana she became suspicious.
"Of course," she said, "you have
studied arithmetic, Lizzie?"
"Lot, ma'am," responded Lizzie

THE Sultan has persisted for years in putting
Americans under the ban in hit empire. The
position and privileges accorded to Europeans, in
respect of residence and freedom in business and pro
fessional practice, have been persistently refused to
Americans. This has resulted in the outlawry of our
countrymen in Turkey. If they were located there they
were subject to intolerable exactions and restrictions,
enforced not by the mob but by the Government. Our
Minister, after suing for an audience with the Sultan
lor two years, was finally given a hearing in which he
was treated with conspicuous contempt and discourtesy,
and though a time was fixed for an answer to his. re
quests it has been permitted to expire and the Sultan
remains silent.
No Government, and especially not ours, can submit
to such treatment. No matter how small American
interests may be in Turkey we haVe the undoubted
right to demand and enforce equality witlr other nations.
To submit to humiliation, oppression and inequality at
the hands of the most rotten and corrupt of Govern
ments is intolerable. There is but one course to pur
sue and that has been taken by Secretary Hay, in order
ing warohip* to a Turkish p.ort, and if necessary to
menace Constantinople itself.
We have abundant precedents, created under 'all ad
ministrations. When Austria refused to deliver Martin
Kozsta, who had only declared his intention to become
an American and had taken the preliminary steps toward
American citizenship, .an American man-of-war menaced
the Austrian consulate and shipping and compelled the
delivery of Kozsta. This was before the days of cable
communication, and the action was taken upon the order
of Mr. Jackson, the American diplomatic representative,
Â«nd was subsequently indorsed by the Secretary of
State, and is an incident in our history that is the pride
of our people. Their pride is no less invested in the
demand that Americans shall be legally the equal of
men of other nations in the empire oi / thc Sultan.
It is surely a strange thing that Abdul Hamid, who
holds his position as a European ruler by virtue of the
rival ambitions of other Continental nations which he
treats with craft and indifference, should yet grant to
their nationals equality which he denies to Americans,
whose country has no desire to interfere with his posi
tion or the integrity of his empire in Europe, Asia
Minor or Africa.
While it is true that only the Congress of the United
States can deciare war, it is also true that the Presi
dent can use the force of the nation to protect such
American rights as are denied by the' Sultan, by mak
ing a naval demonstration and even by proceeding to
the extreme of throwing shot through the palace and
seraglio of the Sultan. If Turkey remain obdurate and
continue an insulting and defiant attitude, the same
American pride and sentiment that would have de
manded war against Austria to enforce the rights of
Martin Kozsta will demand that Congress take the
most extreme measures against Turkey in the present
controversy. It would be a conflict which Europe would
regard with complacency, for.it might well end with
the destruction of European Turkey, and the solving of
the problem of the "Sick Man," which has been the
despair of the Continental powers and Great Britain.
No American is so insensible to the dignitx of his
country as to refuse approval of vigorous action in such
a situation. When Secretary Hay sent his ultimatum to
the Sultan of Morocco in the case of Perdicaris, de
manding "Perdicaris alive, or Rassouli dead," he struck
the universal chord of American feeling. We will not
be treated with contempt or put under the ban of in
equality by any nation, and least of all by such organized
iniquity as Turkey.
The Sultan has so long enjoyed immunity from the
Continental powers and has reduced lying to so fine an
art that he has become proud and puffed up with the
idea that he can do as he pleases with a nation so dis
tant, as the United Stated. The sentiment of modern
Governments and of civilization demands that the na
tionals of one country shall be rafe and equal in all
other countries. The subjects of the Sultan come her.e
and find absolufe equality of right. They have mobility
throughout our borders, can engage in business or the
practice of a profession, and are amply protected by
our laws, being under no ban on account of race or
religion.
By the treaty of Smyrna, negotiated for the United
States by Commissioners Rhind and Offley and Com
modore Biddle, and by Mohammed Hamed for Turkey,
it was agreed that "Merchants . of the Sublime Porte!
whether Mussulmans or Rayahs, going and coming, in
the countries, ports and provinces of the United States,
or proceeding from one port to another, or from the
ports of the United States to those of other countries,
shall pay the same duties and imposts that are paid by
the most favored 1 nations, and they shall not be vexed
by the exaction of higher duties; and in' traveling by sea
and land, all the privileges and distinctions observed
toward the subjects of other powers shall serve as a
rule and shall be observed toward the merchants and
subjects of the Sublime Porte. In^ like manner Ameri
can merchants, who shall come to the well defended
countries of the Sublime, Porte, shall pay the same duties
and imposts that are paid by merchants of the most
favored friendly powers, and they, shall not in any way
be vexed or molested. American merchants established
in the well defended states of the Sublime Porte, for
purposes of commerce, shall have liberty to employ
semsars (brokers) of any nation - or religion in like
manner as merchants of other friendly powers, and
they shall not be disturbed in their affairs, nor shall
they be treated in any way contrary to established
usage." '
That treaty has been systematically violated by Tur
key and observed by us. Turkey must now keep faith
or take the consequences.
a short time ago effected a clever cap
ture in this way. He noticed a man,
pipe In mouth, walking up and down
a street in the West End of London
ond continually striking matches to
light his pipe. Strange* to say, how
ever, no smoke emanated from the
pipe, and, thinking something was
wrong, the detective concealed himself
and awaited development?. A few
minutes later the man struck another
match, and in a trice a boy about 12
years old came out from the front
door of an unoccupied house, bearing
on his shoulders a sack with sticks of
wood protruding from the end.
The detective "smelt a rat" and at
once detained the lad, In whose sack,
under the wood, was found over Â£4000
worth of Jewels. The "country squire"
endeavored to make his escape and
the boy protested that he had never
seen him, but it was afterward dis
covered that the bucolic gentleman
was v. well-known ticket-of-leave man.
As a general rule old penal servi
tude men are the founders of thieves'
"schools." Realizing that, as they are
too well known to the' police, their
chnnces of continuing a felonious
career in a successful manner are very
slight, they have perforce to procure
understudies.
Accordingly, by enlarging on the
profits accruing from burglaries and
pocket-picking, they have little diffi
culty in getting hold of boys with evil
propensities. \Weks and weeks are
then spent in instructing the novices
in their new trade. The initial les
sons are generally devoted to the art
or picking pooketp. .'.,.*
I^adies* dresses, when the pocket is
made at the back of the skirt, offer
little difficulty, but before the pupils
are allowed to try their hand in
earnest they have (just as in the days
of Fagin, the J^w) to satisfy their
teachers "at home," and experiments
are first of all made on female accom
plices, who decide whether the bud
ding pickpocket is sufficiently pro
ficient to launch out In "public life."
Tie pine, said a detective to the
writer, are generally removed in this
way: Working in pair?, the thieves
wait their opportunity, and in a busy
thoroughfare they pretend to jay
good-by a few paces in front of their
"quarry." As he approaches one ac
complice walks away, but before he
has gone far turns round and hands
his friend a paper or something- of the
kind, at the same time stretching
across the owner of the pin, apologiz
ing the while for being so impolite as
to do so. It is while stretching across
that the pin is removed, as the object
handed is held between the first and
second fingers, while the tie pin is
removed wlthVhe third* and fourth
fingers.
Only a short time ago a policeman
actually saw a man steal a tie pin;
caught In the act, the thief, loudly
protesting: his innocence, struggled
with the constable, but was taken in
charge and searched. To the police
man's surprise nothing was found on
hfm, and he was ultimately released.
After the day's work the policeman
changed his "mufti" and to his sur
prise found the pin, the cause of all
the trouble. In his own pocket. The
thief had placed it there during the
struggle; his days of liberty were,
however, numbered, for a few weeks
later he was arrested for burglary and
in the course of his trial he confessed
that since he was eleven years old he
had been a pupil of a well-known

port of anything. When the administration of his own
party was in power his genius for opposition led him to
antagonize it, eve.n upon issues which it was later
strated that his better judgment approved.
When Mr. Cleveland found it necessary to strongly
intervene to save Â«ound money and the public credit,
Vest attacked him with unexampled force. Announcing
that he and the President had "reached the parting of
the ways,", he led the party revolt which destroyed the
President's leadership and put the party finally in the
hands of Mr. Bryan, to be inoculated with every dis
ease of political heresy, from which it has not yet re
covered. ,
_ Later on. Vest in many expressions antagonized
Bryan, carrying into 'unofficial party leadership : the
same spirit of opposition that led him to oppose the
President. But in all this career . of opposition to
everything in/liis party and out he created but few
personal asperitiej and was a general favorite with
all his colleagues.
His methods did not satisfy the business aspirations
of his State, and it came to be thought that Missouri
required a Senator more in touch with actual things.
It is doubtful- if she succeeded when Stone was elected
his successor, for Stone is" a man of visions, all bad.
The sorrow for the passing of Vest is genuine and
is not confined to the public men of his own party.

It has been a sore point with the
Chief and Commissioners ever since
the charter came into effect that in
efficient officers have been promoted
to positions of command through
passing a civil service examination,
and Commissioner Howell voiced the
sentiments of the department yester
day when he said: "Many sergeants
who took the civil service examina
tions and failed would make better
lieutenants than those who passed.
This is not intended as a criticism of
civil service, which is well enough in
the first instance, but after the, men
are- in the department their superior
officers are the best judges of their
capabilities."
The proposed amendment that a
majority of the Superior Judges
should appoint the Police Judges was
not carried. Commissioners Hutton
and Howell voted in the affirmative
and Reagan and Drinkhouse in the
negative, making it a tie vote. It was
agreed, however, that Hutton â¢ and
Howell should as private citizens sub
mit the matter to the Board of Su
pervisors.
At. a special meeting of the Police
Commissioners yesterday afternoon an
other charter amendment was proposed
for submission to the voters.
It was in effect that section l'of
chapter 7 be amended for the bet

read as follows: "All promotions in
the Police Department shall be made
by the Board of Police Commissioners,

Going to the east side of the river, he
said, the problem of controlling the de
bris that is yearly carried down the
Feather River from the old hydraulic
workings must next be grappled with.
This plan would require the diversion
of the waters of the Feather River
into the great basins, where the slack
ening of the water's force would result
in the deposit of silt it carried, and
then/comparatively clear, the stream
would again be turned into the Sacra
mento River as far down as topography
would permit.
This is the plan in brief as explained
by Hall, but it was. embellished with a
fund of technical points and conditions
that were apparently appreciated by the
board. Hall .was. thanked at the con
clusion of his talk and assured that the
same had given the members of the
board a fuller understanding of the
problem that Is before them. â¢...â¢- 'â¢Â¦;Â«*
Plans of the distant past, devised to
control the flood waters of the Sacra
mento River were explained in detail
yesterday to the Board^of Engineers,
employed by the River Improvement
and Drainage Association, by ,W. H.
Hall, . formerly in charge of the re
clamation work. ' Hall first gave a suc
cinct history of the floods and the im
mense loss that has followed in their
wake and placed most of the blame for
the condition on the shoulders of the
hydraulic miners,, the debris from
whose works filled the streams for hun
drfds of miles around and ultimately
found its way into the great rivers
that are now the subject of so much
concern.
The plans, Pall pointed out, had in
view, not the building of levees along
the river so much as did the
temporary assistance of the stream,
until it could work out its
own salvation by the , process
of erosion. Hall pointed out that the
river, if debris was not constantly car
ried into it by the mountain streams,
would ultimately clear itself by the
erosive force of its flow. \ The question
that remained to be' solved is: How
can debris from these mountain
streams be prevented from reaching the
main river until such time as its wa
ters have scoured Its banks and bottom
and removed the tremendous amount of
silt that has raised it in many places
above the level of the surrounding
country?
The most comprehensive plan, Hall
said, Involved the interception of the
waters of the many small streams that
flow into- the Sacramento River from the
west, having their source in the slopes
of the Coast Range. This plan, would
necessitate the construction of an in
tercepting channel that would carry
these silt laden streams. below the in
undated territory, or, if necessary, to
tide water.
The petition of the Mission Improve
ment Club for an amendment permit
ting that a property owner may at his
own expense tear up the streets for

The petitioners claim the work now
costs four times as much when done
by the city as If done by private con
tract. ..j ry-; ; ';,-, :Â¦ . . >:>o. '.
City Attorney Long petitioned for an
amendment providing for an extra
stenographer and two additional depu
ties in his office and the committee
ruled in favor of it.
The petition for a charter amend
ment raising the salaries of guards at
the jails from $50 to $75 was deferred
until the Sheriff shall be heard from.
The committee reported In favor of
the petition of the Police Commission
that charter amendments be submitted
raising the eligible age limit for police
men from 21 to 25 years, providing for
three grades of patrolmen at monthly
salaries of $90, $95 and $100, and limit
ing promotions to corporal to patrolr
men of, the first grade after five years'
service.
The committee ruled against the
amendment to create a new position
called "Inspector of Police" and to in
crease the pay of police lieutenants to
$1920 yearly.
The committee reported in favor of
a charter amendment providing that
a permit for the construction of a spur
track shall be revocable at the pleas
ure of the Board of Supervisors and
shall only be granted under conditions
which the board may prescribe. The
amendment was called for by a peti
tion of the North Central Improvement
Association.
The joint committee on' Finance and
Charter Amendments of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday reported in fav

ing for an increase in the pay of lieu
tenants, engineers and hostlers in the
Fire Department, increasing the num
ber of firemen in each company by two
and providing for sixty-three days' va
cation each year for members of the
Fire Department.
Petitions signed by 12,000 voters were
filed requesting the, submission of the
proposed amendments to the people
and under the law the board has* no
alternative but to comply.

Fall trade expands but slowly, conservatism
based apparently upon crop disappointments or
uncertainties and labor troubles ruling most
of the lines of distribution. The Government
figures of crop conditions Just issued are In
the main favorable though vitiated by the
early date of replies. Predicted reductions in
the winter wheat crop outturn are confirmed,
but are counterbalanced by the Improvement
In other crops, pointing to a general yield
of food products well above the average. The
early prospects of a large cotton yield are not
materially changed, but predicted lower prices
render buyers of cotton goo.ls cautious. The
Jobbing trade Is not equal to last year's. The
industrial conditions are not altogether prom
ising fn view of the continuance of the meat
strike, which, by the way. Is interfering with
The leather and shoe trades. All in all, the
situation may bo characterized a* still Irregu

the outlook Is one of confidence. Firmness In
wool prices Is still a feature.
.Reports of cuts in the prices of steel products
are current, but good reports come from the

that branch of the trade Is rather quiet, but
the prices are firm Copper has weakened In
price, but tin is slightly higher, though not
holding to the full advances recently shown.

The bulletin abounds in details of
many sorts. One topic relates to the oil
refineries that have been created in
California. The growth of this branch
cf industry is traced in the following
paragraph:
The business cf refining petroleum, while of
triÂ»cy years' standing in this State, having
, originated in 1S56. ha* come Into commercial
rroT.lr.ence enly within the laÂ« ftw years.
TeÂ»i jears ago there were in California but
tÂ»o rotinerles worthy of note, that cf the Ta
ciSc C<*Ft Oil Company at West Alameda and
ttjat of tHÂ» felon Oil Comoany of California,
then lately removed from S&Jita Paula, to Ro
|!eo. During this time the former institution
fce* bten merged In the Standard Oil Company,
Â¦which has removed thÂ» plant to Point Rich
mond, where It has been reconstructed on a
â¢fnuch larger scale, while the latter plant has
also been much enlarged and lmoroved. In
addition, other plant* have from time to time
T*a-n erected, until there are now within the
limits of the State some thirty-four oil re
fineries, with a gross still capacity approxi
mating 3T.&00 barrels, all of which plants,
"â¢with *ossibly one or two exceptions, are now
In successful operation.
â¢ The work on the bulletin, so reports
the Mineralogist, has extended over a
period of two years, and the greatest
.tare has been exercised in the collec
tion df data. The aim of the bulletin is
to describe the conditions under which
.* jietroleum is produced, the amount,
eotirce and character of production
".and to outline some of the more Im
portant ways In which the output is
consumed. Samples of oil were col
lected by a field asssistant and analy
ees that serve to show the character
istics of oils In various fields are sup
rMed.
'â¢ '.The existence of asphaltum and pe
Â¦ troJeum in California was known to
*ar]y settlers from the Eastern States
â¢exf the Union. Semi-solid bitumen from
seepages was used, from very early
o times, as fuel and as a cement. As
Â¦*<arly as 1S56 the more liquid petroleum
v. : as collected and refined in a crude
Â¦way and burning and lubricating oils
â¢were made. At least one of the refiner
ies had quite an extensive plant, but all
j the early oil refineries failed to make
money and all were abandoned after a
time.
â¢ 'A number of asphalt refining plants
'that were established in the earlier
survived longer than the oil re
fiBfsries. The earliest of the refineries
r.ntefiated the first production of oil
from -r.ells by at least eight years,
which fact Is cited as showing a rather
"Crude petroleum, more than any oth
â¢r. rr t ineral production . of California,
XiMv f.fures in the industrial life of
this State. Gold represents a much
larger value than petroleum when the
annual statistics of yieJd are made up
and probably more coin is invested in
plants for gold mining than in oil and
copper combined. Petroleum occupies
a .unique position, in that it has largely
displaced another mineral, coal, and
that, unlike other mineral products, no
jire,sersi attempt is making to take the
crude fuel from the ground as fast as
possible. Manufacturing has been as
eured as a home industry by cheap fuel
oil. As there are supplies of oil known
In" California, of practically inexhaust
ible extent, the industrial possibilities
Â«re great.
At various times reviews of the oil
fields and the oil industries of Cali
fornia hav<Â» been published. It has been
reserved for the State Mineralogist of
California \o treat the entire topic in
de.taiL Much light that ought to serve
ef an attraction for the investment of
Outside capital in California is derived
from a bulletin that Mineralogist Au
fcury has just Dublished. The general
theme contains so much of interest
that extracts from the bulletin are re-
JJubllshed here as follows:
The present production is simply * matter
cC poeeible consumption. The potential possi
bilities cf increase cf production Is hardly a
Jr.atter for fijrure*. The fields Include Â¦everal
hundred square miles of territory, which,
Â»hi!e all is nrt definitely proved up. is highly
j r :.â: > to prove profitable ground. Of ail
tbe forty or so rquare miles of actually pro
ducing territory in the State, there is probably
rot one sxjuare ir.i!e, outside cf LÂ»cs Angeles,
Cummerland and tome parts cf Ventura
County, that hap been drilled to anything lik*
Its maximum capacity. The present produc
tion could be increased. .If consumption war
. ranted, by at least three or four time*, within
the *ime required to eink the necessary wells.
REFIMXG INDUSTRY.
According to the Grass Valley
Union the Knights who are coming to
the Knights Templar Conclave in this
city from Nevada County will give
away gold quartz to show the sort -of
country that Nevada County is. The
Nevada County mining superintend
ents will furnish enough milling ore
to make a handsome display. This
will be broken up and put in Jewelers'
boxes for distribution to Eastern
Knights as souvenirs.
W. C. Oakes has bonded the Dolly
Varden mine in Sierra County and has
begun operations. A pocket waa found
on the ledge some years ago. Since
then little development work has been
done, with the exception of running
a tunnel through to tap the shaft
where the pocket was.
Eastern parties have paid the . first
Installment on the Lappin mine bond.
The mine is at Deadwood, Trinity
County.
Gold dredging on the Hallett place,
five miles below Smartsville, has be
gun. One machine is working. A sec
ond will soon operate.
The Redding Free Press says that a
smelter will be placed on the Dunham
mine by a San Francisco company..
The Mother Lode Banner says that
San Francisco men are arranging to
mine in the bed of the Tuolumne
River at Moffltt's bridge by dredging,
but that place has already been mined
by Moffltt, he having turned the water
into large flumes and mined the dry
bed.
The San ' Diego Union reports that
there is revived activity in the Julian
mining district- Four companies are
operating in the Boulder Creek vi
cinity.
The Redding Searchlight says that
the Afterthought camp is the scene of
a great deal of work. A smelter has
boen completed and the machinery Is
going into place. The smelter may
be blown in by September 1.
The Angels Camp Mountain Echo
reports that the .Metropolitan Gold
Mining Company, that has been oper
ating the Allison group of mines, has
ceased to exist. Miners and laborers
are looking for their pay, with little
hope of getting it. Time checks were
issued for labor two months ago, but
no one woujd honor them. Some rich
rock was run through the mill, so says
the Echo, and the proceeds were
cleaned up and carried away. The
men were pajd in time checks.
ACTIVITY AT JULIAN".
His company has men engaged in the pre
liminary work upon Noo. 3, 4 and 5 on Buck
Creek. The surveys have been completed ' and
everything is now in readiness for the in
stallation of machinery.
Surveyors are at work everywhere laying
off claims and many of the mines are being
actively worked. On claims Nos. 7 and li.
Buck Creek, owned by the American Tin Min
lne Company, there are sixty men at work
in night and day shifts, and two to three
tons of placer tin are cleaned up every twenty*
four hours. . This company has also a drlu
with which the benches and tundra are being
prospected, with good results. The York-
Alaska, Company is operating at the head
of the creek and has a steam ehovel on the
ground. It Is also bringing its steam
freighter over the divide and will use it for
the transportation, of its freight. Nearly all
of the freight in that part of thÂ« country,
according to Mr. Osborne, Is being taken In
by way of Providence. During the recent
Etcrm the water in the bay at that point wax
comparatively smooth. From Providence to
the mine it is only a distance of twelve miles
and it is possible to convey the supplies in
poling boats up the Mint and Grousa creeks
to within five miles of the workings. By the
construction of a few wing dams at an ex
pense not to exceed $1500 Mr. Osborne thinks
that it would be roeslble to ascend these
streams to Buck Creek.
The mining of tin, according to the
Nome News of July '26, is going, on
largely in the Seward Peninsula dis
tricts. The Bartels Company, that is
operating at Cape- Prince of "Wales,
may ship 2000 tons of tin ore at. the
close of navigation. Five mines are
operating, about half, a mile inter
vening between the ! first . and last.
Two vessels were landing supplies at
the time of the report, which was
made by W. C. Bartels, the president
and general manager of the Bartels
Company. The Nome News has also
interviewed Charles Osborne, gen
eral manager of the Alaska Tin
Mines, Limited. Osborne made the
following statement:
TIX IX ALASKA.
The boom wÂ«n the way of all booms. Great
numbers of comsanles wire promoted by un
principled parties, who put the proceeds of
stock Bales out of harm's way. Many more
were so mismanaged as to wast* their entire
resources on preparations, while others were
unfortunate In their locations. The production
cf the Kern River fifld for the first year was
several times the production of the entire
State for any previous year. As a consequents
the price, of oil, which had ranged from $1 to
$1 10 i*r barrel, fell to 8 or 10 cents. Pro
ducing companies could not pay expenses.
Stork sales ceased and the bubble collapsed.
But the boom, while disastrous to many. Indi
viduals, was o< much real benefit to the oil
Industry and to the.Btate at large. Hundreds
of corncanics located In the most remote, ana
mow unlikely BDOts, where legitimate, capital
would probably never have been risked. Though
the percentage of failures was very large, the
wildcatters developed several hundred wells In
entirely new territory, thus proving up ground
which would have remained untouched other
wise. When the excitement had passed away
the production of the State, had increased from
2.r>00,00o barrels to nearly 7,750,000 barrels
per annum. An enormous amount of well
invested capital remained In the business, and
It had been shown that, under rational man
agement, the production of, and even the pros
pecting for,- petroleum In California formed
legitmate employment for capital. '
Wells were drilled in Humboldt, Men
docino, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Con
tra Costa, Colusa, Santa Barbara and
Ventura counties. A considerable indus
try was created in Ventura County
alone at that time. Then little devel
opment work was done until 1S02, when
E. S. Doheny struck oil in the city of.
Los Angeles. In 1S95 C. A. Canfield and
others found oil at Coalinga in Fresno
County. About that time oil was dis
covered on the James Means ranch,
near Bakersfleld, Kern County. Then
came the boom period for petroleum.
Within three years 2400 oil companies
filed incorporation papers in this State.
Most of these companies sold more or
less stock. At least 1200 companies
drilled for oil. What happened when
the boom was ready to collapse is de
scribed in the bulletin by Paul W.
Prutzman, and an interesting period of
history is summarized in a few words:
remarkable reversal of the usual order.
The oil industry of California actually
dates back to 1865, when Professor
Benjamin Silliman reported on samples
of petroleum and seepages in Ventura
County.

FRIDAY, AUGUST 12.
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Kohler, who arrived here recently
from Puget Sound, secured employment
in the Enterprise restaurant, Fourth
and Tehama streets. As tfie income
from this position was only sufficient
to enable him *to retain very humble
apartments at 222% Fourth street, he
appealed to his father, Gustav Kohler,
for funds. Papers found In his room
show that his appeal was answered
with a check for $40. This ha imme
diately proceeded to spend for liquor.
Guido Kohler, a young man late of
Napoleon, Ohio, is- dead in this city,
a suicide. Misfortune, born evidently
of a shiftless nature, but which he ap
parently attributed to adverse fate,
was followed by despondency, whicn
finally, overcame him. Early yester
day morning, after having squandered
the last $40 sent him by his father,
he entered the Magelmaker saloon,
southwest corner of Fourth and Te
hama streets, and, taklns a vial of
carbolic acid from his pocket, swal
lowed the contents. He was hurried
to the Receiving Hospital, where he
died a few hours later.

CHICAGO, Aug. 12.â News from the Nerth
weet was . less suggestive of utter ruin to the
growlns wheat cror> than at any time for a
week past. The market almost from the
start appeared to be struggling under a heavy
lead of long wheat. Sentiment at the opening
wavered between confidence and suspicion of
the outlook, with a leaning toward the lat
ter. Initial bids for September at $1 03 TÂ£Â©
$1 041-4 were unchanged to %c higher. Then
the price began to suffer. There were many
traders who believed the grain cheap at the
fractional declines that ensued and nearly
every reverse was followed by a partial re
covery, i The weight of the load of long wheat,
however, was too much for the supporters
of the market. Step by step values settled
back until September was down to $1 01%.
The final efforts of the bulls only operated to
steady the tone and bring about a sharp im
provement In prices. September closed almost
at the bottom, the latest sales being at $1 01%.
In corn, . September, the leading option,
started unchanged to Me higher, advanced on
free covering, but closed a shade above the
bottom at 63%Â©53?4c
September oats opened firm, with a gain
of at 34%c. declined to 83T4@>33%c and
cloced at S3 '4 c.
In provisions - the selling out of September
holdings under the influence of lower prices

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Paris and Liverpool futures were
higher. . ?
Chicago rose to I1IMH and fell back to'
$1 01%. Inquiries sent out by a national bank
to 1O42 banks in as many districts in Alaba
ma. Arkansas, Illinois, Indian Territory, Iowa
Kansas. Kentucky, Louisiana. Michigan. Okla
homa, South Dakota. Tennessee and Texas and
throughout the Middle West, brought answers
of crops retarded by cool nights and unfavor
able weather, but that in spite of this all
crops except Wheat showed an Increase over
last year.
The Chicago wires of R. Brent Mitchell said:
'There was nothing new In the Northwestern
advices except (one reiteration of previous
reports of damage. The area damaged does not
seem to be spreading and talk concerning It is
on the whole, more rational. While, foreign
markets were higher, they only partially fol
lowed-yesterday's advance. Weekly shipments
from Argentina were large. The movement
of winter wheat continues heavy, and while
much demand Is reported It seems to come
largely from elevator people, and the wheat Is
probably being hedged by sales for future de
livery. Harvesting has begun in the Nqrth
; west and will be in pretty full -blast in'an
1 other week. At these prices a movement from
this quarter will probably be rapid. With no
export demand stocks will be likely to In
crease quite fast. The action of the market ;
rather Indicates that the force of speculation I
on conditions as they are has temporarily ex
hausted itself. The situation In our Judgment
etlll Invite* conservatism."
In this market futures were lower and very
quiet In the cash grain quotations were 2%c
higher as a rule, with a firm but quiet market.

Fresh arrivals of river Potatoes were light,
but there was plenty of carried-over stock on
hand and the market continued weak, with
trade very quiet and prices unchanged. Sup

very hard to sell. Sweet Potatoes arrived
rather freely from Merced and Stockton and
sold at 3Â©3%c per pound. Onions were quoted
steady to firm, with supplies light and the
demand fair. Â¦
Miscellaneous vegetables arrived freely from
â¢ various sections and the market was weak,
with prices tending downward. Tomatoes were
, lower, as receipts were heavier and the de
mand less urgent. Green Corn was In excessive
supply and weak, particularly for poor stock
in eack.Â« from Stockton.

and - even the fanciest young ' Roovters and

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Reports as to Butter varied considerably
along the street yesterday., but the quotations
below are about as close a* could be ob
tained. Large line* of Eastern are etlll being
cut up Into squares and sold as fine California
creamery, as the holders of these goods are
making the most of the opportunity now af
forded by the local advance to sell off at a
very large profit. These are great days for
holders of Eastern and stored Butter, the
only drawback being that trade Is unusually
dull. â¢
Cheese continue* top-heavy and dull, with
large stocks.
Choice ranch Eggs continue firm, though the
market Is dull. Supplies of fine ranch are
light, but therÂ« are still plenty of seconds
on the market.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The fruit market was liberall? supplied with
! nearly all descriptions of small tree varieties
and, although there was a fair movement in
shipping channels, the general tone of the mar
ket was one of easiness, as local trade was
quiet, as usual tin Friday. The canners were
still purchasing freely of Bartlett Pears* in
bulk, but prices of No 1 -rtock had a wider
range. Fine large fruit continued steady at
$25@30 per ton, while small-sized offerings
were selling at $20Â®22 50. Fancy wrapped
stock was plentiful and" inclined to easiness,
and the top quotation was obtained only for
selected lots suitable for shipment. Peaches
arrived freely from reveral sections and the
receipts included much poor and small stock
in small boxes. The market was glutted with
Plums and Prunes and bulk stock was prac- .
tlcally unsalable, as the canners were not in I
the market, being too busy with Pears. Small
lots of mountain Feaches were received from
Coloma and met with prompt sale at a sub
stantial premium. Nectarines and Figs were
In light but ample supply and prices ranged
lower. Faafix Gravensteln Apples were firmly
held at higher figures and other varieties
showed mere steadiness. Melons were in ex
cessive supply and weaker while Grapes were
steady. Mallnda Strawberries were easier
under increased receipts and Raspberries sold
at a wider range, the top quotations being
obtained only for choice Santa. Clara Berries.
There was no change in prices of Citrus or 1
Tropical fruits.

The pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany wants a 5210,000 dock. Some
time ago it. made known its wishes in
the matter and plans were drawn up
by the Board of Harbor Commission
ers accordingly. The company stipu
lated for a wharf with sunken car
track, which would be flush with the
floor of the structure and consequent
ly would be more expensive. A two-
Btery shed was asked for. The upper
floor was planned to receive the pas
sengers and lighter articles of freight
and the lower part would be reserved
for heavy cargo. :.'/Jv\.' ;.
A commodious and handsome struc
ture was projected and the Harbor
Commissioners advertised for, bids, of
which the lowest received was $291,
000. As the board has no ready
money for such an^- outlay the Pacific
Mail would, have to pay the contrac
tor and draw it outof their dock rent
al at $1600 a month. The company
figured that it would take about, fif
teen years to jget the money back at
this rate and the interest for that
time would amount to nearly $100,
000. The additional expense, would
make the Â¦ rent about , $2100 a .' month,
outside of tolls and other expenses.
This was thought too much . and the
company declined, the lease of the new
wharf ana shed. .There was nothing
else for /the Commissioners -to do ex
cept declare all bids 'off and prepare
other plans.
The Pacific Mail Company now
asks for two wharves andslngle-sto
ried sheds to cost about ' $210,000,
which they will lease under the terms
first proposed.

-A letter has been received In San
Francisco from J. A. Filcher, one of the
California Commissioners to the St.
Louis Exposition, In which he com
plains strongly of the quality of the
fresh fruit that Is being sent by Cali
fornia fruit growers for exhibition.
Pears, so writes Filcher. are forwarded
for the advertising uses of the Cali
fornia Commissioners that ought to be
fed to hogs. The peaches are inferior
to those exhibited by Eastern fruit
growers. Hardly any of the fresh fruit
that is going from California to the
exposition is up to the exposition
standard.
Some, and, Indeed, most of the fruit
to be exhibited is commercially packed.
That is. It is sent in the cheapest sort
of style, and when It Is unpacked is
largely unfit for exhibition. Practically
no good fruit comes to the Commis
sioners.
To-day J. W. Barry, who represents
the California Commisioners in San
Francisco as their shipping agent, will
appear before the executive committee
of the Sacramento Valley Development
Association. He will ask that the fruit
growing counties of the Sacramento Val
ley make some arrangements by which
fresh fruit be supplied. What Barry
will say to the Sacramento Valley people
may as well be taken home by any
other fruit growers in the State who
are not doing their best to advertise
California while the exposition is as
sembling people from" all over the world
as spectators and inquirers. Barry says
that he is willing to personally super
intend the packing and selection of
fruit as far as possible, if the fruit
growers will do their part.
Some action will probably be taken at
Sacramento to-day.

FILCHER MAKES
STRONG PLAINT
Suit Transferred.
The suit of A. C. Freese, aj admin
istrator of' the estate of James C. Sln
grer, deceased, against John C Lynch
to recover $686. alleged to have been
illegally collected as a legacy war
tax, has been transferred from the
Superior Court to tha United States
District Court.
The answer of Executors Gray and
Mugan to the contest of Adolph Schan
der was also filed. It denies that Miss
Dolbeer died intestate, but declares
ehe sitrned the will of April 23. 1904.
It denies that Schander. his brother
&rd sister are the heirs at law and
it denies that Bertha Dolbeer was not
c.f a sound and disposing mind and de
nies that she was incompetent to make
a will when the will in question was
Figned.
Etta Marion "Warren, the friend of
Bertha M. Dolbeer and the chief bene
ficiary under her will, has Joined in the
defense against the contest of Adolph
Schander and others, who seek to dis
turb the desires of the unfortunate girl
who fell, or flan? herself. last month
from the ninth story of the Waldorf-
Astoria Hotel in New York.
Miss Warren's answer to the Schan
der contest Is not indorsed by any law
yer, but it was filed yesterday at the
probate desk of the County Clerk's
office by a representative of E. S. Pills
bur>. attorney for Mr. Mugan, one of
the .executors. Miss Warren admits
the Tacts of Miss Dolbeer's death and
admits that she is the principal legatee
under Miss Dolbeer's will, but she de
nies the allegation of Schander that
the testatrix was of unsound mind at
' the time of making her last testa
ment.
Yesterday was the day appointed for
th<5 second move in the Vontest over
Miss Dolbeer's will. Judge Hunt was
fitting in Judge Coffey's department
and It was understood that there
should be no hearing of the case until
Judge Ccffey returns from his vaca
tion. Therefore Judge Hunt ordered a
continuance until August 22. a week
from next Monday, at which time it
Is assured that Judge Coffey will be at
his post.
Attorney Albert Johnson appeared
yesterday for the Schander side and
Attorney W. F. Williamson for the
executors. Johnson said the contest
would havie to be served upon four
teen heirs, some of whom, were disin
clined to accept service. He thought
the hearing should be continued for
forty days. Williamson opposed this,
asking: for a hearing soon after Judge
â¢Coffey's return. He wanted two weeks,
but Judge Hunt set the next hearing
on the probate for August 22. >v
During the afternoon answers were
filed to the Schander contest and a
demurrer to the contest of the New
York claimants. The demurrer in the
name of Gray and Mugan, executors
of the will of Bertha Dolbeer. was di
rected against the contest of Frazier
M. Dolbeer. Jane Ann Brown, Alice
H. Fern and Stephen T. Dolbeer on
thÂ»Â» ground that the contest did not
show that Miss Dolbeer left any uncles
or aunts, ar.d it was uncertain whether
th<> contestants were heirs at law.
Upon a case argued yesterday in his
court Judge Hunt may be called upon
to decide a question which will involve
the validity of many marriages, the;
legitimacy of children and the title to
estates of persons who have died since
the passage of the law providing for
interlocutory decrees of divorce.
Amelia B. Grannis on July 1, 1903,
was granted an absolute divorce from
James G. Grannis by Judge Slo^s. who
awarded the wife $4200 in property and
$4800 in money, to be paid by the hus
band in installments of $100.
The wife later decided that she was [
not satisfied 'with the division of the j
property and appealed to the Supreme j
Court, but the case was dismissed by j
the higher tribunal for want of prose- I
cution. She now appears in the Supe- !
rior Court with a motion to vacate and '
set aside the Judgment. "{
If Judge Hunt decides that the Judg- |
ment is void because, of the law provid
ing for an interlocutory decree his de- !
cision will involve all of the marriages j
made by other persons who have se- 1
cured absolute decrees from the court !
since the passage of the interlocutory :
decree law, the legitimacy of the chil- |
dren born or to be born to them and 1
the estates of persons who have died i
with interests based upon such a de
cree. It is provided in the law that an :
appeal may be taken within six months
from a decree of the Superior Coun.. i
and the fact that an appeal was taken j
and dismissed in this case may serve '
as an estoppel and give Judge Hunt j
an opportunity for not passing upon
the question of absolute decrees here
tofore granted. The fact that Mrs.
Grannis has accepted the monthly pay
ments from her "husband may prevent
her from getting a decision setting
aside the ruling of Judge HIoss.
