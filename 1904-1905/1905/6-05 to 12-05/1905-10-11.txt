sion candidate for Mayor. From dome to pit the house was crowded, with: tfiei leading men of the Republican and Democratic parties in attendance.

Individuai Appeal

of the City.
The campaign in support of .John. S.
Partridge for Mayor is going ahead
with unusual energy under the direc
tion of the Joint executive committee
of Republicans and Democrats.
' There is not the slightest doubt that
the entire fusion ticket will be elected
if Partridge wins out. Leaders of the
fusion .movement are confident of suc
cess. The confidence Js based on-such
information, as an * enterprising com
mittee iÂ« In position to obtain.. >Z.TÂ»:
In the well-conducted primary elec
tion campaign the leaders of the San
Francisco Republican League did . not
make the mistake of underestimating
the enemy's strength. In fact, the. boss
of the Schmitz administration was ac
accredited with more sagacity as a.
manipulator and more strength a<s a
manager than be displayed. Ruef him
self made the blunder of under
rating the numerical strength and
fighting: quality of the league. He
sought to discourage the league -pro
moters by offering to wager money
that the Ruefters would win every As
sembly district of the city, but instead
of disheartening hlo opponents he de
ceived his own followers.
RAt fusion headquarters the fact-Js
:ognlged that all the grafters of the
Schmltz- administration, all-^the 'keepers
of shady resorts and the . disreputable
element generally will line up in sup
port of the Ruef ticket on November 7.
It is well understood that the greatest
battle ever fought " at the, polls, in 'San
Francisco must be waged to overthrow^
the legions of vice and graft, hence the"
joint executive committee is prepar
ing to bring to the front every, citizen
who Ib loyal to the cause of clean, hon
ost municipal government. ;
Mass meetings and public^ demonstra
tions are good -to awaken 'enthusiasm;
but something more than oratory is re
quired to win political battles. 1 . /Work
roust be done in the line of 'reaching
the voter by lndivldual^appeal to his
sense of civic duty. The fusion leaders

making, and when 8 o'clock came the house was jammed from top to" botr. '

the- building/ Material, was plentiful for overflow meetings, but oratory,
was concentrated lnpide- the- Alhambra.
. In- the -midst of Woodruff's \u25a0 speech John S." Partridge was brought
through the crowd at. the rear of the hall and down the aisle toward the
stage amid congratulatory words of those, nearest him and the cheers and
applause of , the, entire assemblage.; At the conclusion of Woodruff's speech^

John I. Sabin, president of the Pa
cific States Telephone Company, died
shortly after 9 o'clock last evening at
his home. 2S2S California street.' where
he had been an Invalid for the past two
weefy"). Although his friends knew that
he was sick, few of them expected that
death would result..
According to a statement made last
evening by one of his physicians. Dr.
Philip King- Brown. Mr. Sabin had been
a chronic Invalid for a number of years
and a recent attack of rheumatism,
combined with his old trouble. Is sup
posed to have been responsible for his
untimely ending: Evjry means known
to medical science was resorted to to
prolong 1 the life of the patient, but ha
sank rapidly and passed peacefully
away - last evening.
Almost all of Mr. Sabin's family was
with: him when he died. His daughter,
who waj* recently married to Captain
A. .W. Bjornstad, XJ. S. A., with whom
she "is now visiting New Tork. was
advised of her father's death last night
arid .will start for the coast to-day.
The funeral will take place Friday
from the family residence on Cali
fornia street, and will probably be* held
under:" the auspices of the Masonic or
der/" of. which the deceased was a mem
ber.
The passing of John I. Sabin removes
from the community one of its leading
citizens. . He was born In New Yorlc
in 1547, and in.lS6l he wm

Western Union Telegraph Company.
Six months later he rras made an op
erator, and he continued in that po
sition until the outbreak of the war,
when he enlisted as a telegraph oper
ator., serving until 1565. when he cama
to California with the Collins Over
land Telegraph expedition, which was
made under the direction of the West

want men who will uo things and not those who deplore the sad conditioniof
affairs because they are June. We want men- who have faith hi the futurp'Of
Sau Francisco and -are willing to translate that Jlaith Into ,word 3. . We want

any transgression of "the law. "T \u25a0\u25a0
"For nearly .two years now*, in connection with my work in the City Attor
ney's oSjce. I have made a vsry thorough study of that body of lav.- VrioHn
as the new Charter. Most of its provisions have been before the Supreme
Court, and we know just about what they mean. It is a very plain and simple
Instrument end if its provisions art? faithfully carried out. it will give ua an
almost perfect municipal government. But, like all other legislation, it depends
entirely upon tbe kind of men'wi.o administer it. You cannot legislate decency
into people. In vain are the provisions for civil service If the administration is
bent on using the employes' to build up a political machine; in vain are . the
provisions against the use. of the poli..e for political purposes if the commis
sion chooses to disregard them; in vaia are those sections which are to give us
a fair and non-partisan election commission if their express provisions are ig
nored and disobeyed. Good men wiH give you good government under the worst
laws and b?.d men will crivc you had government under the test laws.
"The Democratic and Rc-publiean conventions have unselfishly presented
for your consideration a ticket " composed of men, nearly all of whom have
already served you faithfully and well. It is what the football, player^
rail a 'picked team.' They have stood against the grafters and corruption
jsts and have saved tho city .government from absolute destruction.
PULL LEVER ONCE IN DECENCY'S CAUSE.
"1 do believe that it would be far bettor for the forces of decency to
lo^e the Mayor than the rest ol Uic ticket, and I most earnestly entreat
you to vote that ticket straight. I do not want any of you io vote for me on
pr-rsoiial grounds, but only because you believe In the principles I repre
sent, and if you are steadfast in these principles, you will swing tiiat lever
once and give your place in the booth to some one else.
"Ladles and pcntlemen, I have already attempted m my speeches before
the two conventions to state plainly and simply what I stand for and what
I intend to do. 1 have said that I accept the nomination entirely against
my will and against what I consider the interests of these who are de
pendent upon me. I have said, and I repeat, that the nomination coming in
th.it way left me absolutely free to do my whole duty to the people, with
no obligation whatever to asiy person or party, and free I am going to
remain to tbe end. But I want you to* believe that I will give you morÂ«
tha:; an anti-bad administration. That Is easy enough.
"But San Francisco is entitled to a thorough-going, good government; a
government that will be not only clean, but efllclent; that will not only turn
rascals out, but will put capable men in; a government that will gel things
done; tliat will make this city* worthy of the high place reserved for it;
that will make it clean and beautiful and wholesome; rich in â¢ material
blessings and richer still in its moral standing among the citie6 of the
world.
"Tho imagination is dazzled by ihe thought of what this city might be
nnd shall be. The Western Pacific is about to open up the northern part
of the State as it never has been opened before. The Ocean Shore is mere
1> the beginning of a net work of suburban HneÃ ."Which will render aeeefi-
Pi'^le tbe unparalleled attractions of the territory around the bay. We want
in be In v position to seize the goldtn opportunities that are all about us.
OUR GOOD NAME MUST BE PROTECTED. '
"We want a government that will command the confidence of the world.
Our reputation is our most valuable asset, and while our natural advan
tages are so great that we couldn't dodgo prosperity if we tried, yet there
is no doubt that the conditions of the last four years have retarded our
growth in many ways. If you are in earnest, we shall remove all that, and
Vlien we once have a city government which will be a matter â¢ of pride,
rather than a crying disgrace, let u-s form ourselves into a great com
mlttee for the advancement of San Francisco, so that capital* may lind here an
Inviting field for investment and laboring men foel secure in abundant em
jilovnuMit at remunerative wages. For myself. I? I lose, any personal feel- \u25a0
ing wil be drowned in sliainc. for the city I love so well. If I win, my
days shall be spent in proud labor for her welfare and my nights in study
ing how best she can be served.
"And nov; I want to say a word to the grafterp. I have told them be
fore that I do not want their votes. 1 give them fair warning to do their
best to defai me, for if I am elected I will throw out every boodler and
every 'grafting commission. l>et us Khvp.no misunderstanding about it. No
honest man need b^ afraid, but every man who has made a' profit of his
office, every man who hr<Â« betrayed the people for gain,, every man who has
rnlin-d the efficiency of the government for his own selfish ends bad bet
ter spend his days and nights working against me. I ask no quarter and
I will give none. â¢ ,
"There can be no compromise with dishonesty, no mercy for dishonfpt'
m*Â»n. And I call upon you all to help me. I appeal to the decent manhoodâ
aye, and to the decent womanhood â of San Francisco to assist me. I ap- :
p^al to the young: men; I appeal to those who .love their home?; I appeal
to the taxpayers who want their money . properly and honestly expended,
1 apeal top the honest and fair-minded working men, and the men In
all calling^ who are in favor of honesty and a square deal. I want to talk
to as many of you as I can and tell you that this is not my personal fight,
but that almost the very existence of the city js staked upon the issue, and
â¢whether 1 win or lose I Intend to be able to wme back and grasp you by

order Daniel A. Ryan stepped upon the
platform, followed by Joseph S. Tobin.
At the sight of them the house broke into,
a storm of applause which was only si
lenced by Ryan, as he began the intro
ductory speech presenting Mr. Tobin as
the Chairman of the evening. Ryan said
in part:
W e meet here to-night v.ot as Republicans
en-! Democrats, but as citizen? of a crrat
commonwealth, net to discuss {Treat political
<ju*-stions but measures for the defense of our
homes, and in the interest of the honor of our
city and looking for Its preservation, redemp
tion and salvation. We iwtt to ratify a ticket
eelect'd by the groat parties of Lincoln and
Jefferson in the name of the city and county
o' San Francisco for the protection of all
good, noble men and women.
We meet to ratify what has already been
dene for San Francisco in nominating that
'sterling man. Bble lawyer and perfect citizen,
John S. Partridge. Well may you applaud.
and all that have the city's interests at heart !
â¢will applaud on the evening of the 7th of
November, when San Francisco Is redeemed
end can raiae her head among the pure mu
nicipalities of the country.
My function here is to introduce the chair
man of the evening, the distinguished citizen
a-nd lawyer, who is the assurance of the good
faith Of the present meeting, the Honorable
JoF-er.>h 6. Tobin.
Mr. Tobin was warmly greeted and
â¢when the applause had died away deliv
ered the following address:
Tills is a significant gathering. It indi
cates that tbe sluggish blood of this com
munity has betn stirred. By the very depth
of our dishonor ar-d by the . revolting con
ec'ousness of our infamy, civic love Is re
animated, and we no longer Ftruggle as Demo
crats and Republicans for the mf-re spoils of
office, but, as <*itl**ne of a groat city, we
are here to pledge our fnlth an patriotic
Americans th&t Kan Franc!*co. debauched and
polluted, shafl rise S3n Francisco redeemed
end made ".lean.
We need no political device to emphasize
the issue. It has been burned into the rou!
of rach one of uk by the shame tnd corrup
tion f-f our public life- This issue is plain
and must l>e met. Vainly, I say. during this
campaign will low passion bt Inflamed of
high Impulse prostituted to cloud for a mo-
HKTit an Ireue th&t cannot thus be concealed.
Crushed beneath a loath Home buiden of
scandal and corruption, our opponents stagger
to iho bar cf public opinion, screaming in
venomous expostuiatlc-n. "It's a fight of the
rich against the poor; the li*el of capital is
upon the neck of labor." They He. and In
the depths of their hearts they know It. it
Is a vile appeal. An appeal suggested by
crafty ajid unscrupulous men.
It is disproved by this vast audience, rep
resentative of every condition of life. There
is no sympathy here for a class flght; and.
In fact, the life and character of our caa
fiidate is a pledge of the elnoerity of our
profession. If pledge were needed. ,'
Is It not the glory and hope of our de
mocracy that those whose childhood is co
often spent in privation, far from the rush
of great cities. Is it not our hop* and in
spiration that theÂ«e men are so frequently
our chosen leaders, are so often exalted to
thÂ» highest places among us?
Without a suspicion of flatt*ry I can say
our young candidate Is of this type, and his
very life and personaJlty are wholly inconsistent
\u25a0with the false issue sought to be raised In this
campaign. With neither wealth nor influence
how often has such a man proved hlroselt
the vindication and triumph cf government
t.y the jjf-eple. Such a man is presented to
this rneotir.g as the candidate of Republicans
and Democrats in Mr. John S. Partridge.
STRONG TYPE OP MANHOOD.
Xrsemblyrnan Nathan C. Coghlaa wu
the first speaker introduced by Mr. Tobin.
Mr. Coghlan said in part:
. .lust think of two grand old parties com
ing together anÂ«l agreeing: on a man to look
after the welfare of thU city. Could they
have mad.Â» a better selection than picking
out a man from amons ut> as John S. Part
ricge is? Is there any one among us capable
of bestowing- the praise* which he deserves?
Citizens. John Partridge comes before you
as an Ideal man; one whose record is a credit
to Pan Francisco. He comes not as a pam
r>ered eon of a rich family, who has been
reared in a palatial mansion. His career is.
one on which is stamr>ed the true qualities
of American manhood. A ?Â«elf-made. man. who'
was born of Dr.or narenta and has \u25a0worked his
way along from his youth by hard work and
induetry.
Let us look back to the records of municipal
history. Time after time cities have fallen
Into the hands of officials who ehamed them
by corruption. Time after time the people's
â¢iuggteh blood haÂ« been aroused and they have
downed those whose greed for money did not
stop them- from making the municipality their
prey. We are again faced by this crisis I and
the people are again aroused and have come
to the realization that something must be
done.
The citizens of this city are aware of the
conditions of the past and on the seventh
day of next month they will show this by
putting Into office John S. Partridge, a man
who reorepcntÃ the common people.
Chairman Tobin next introduced
Thomas XV. Hlckey, the chairman of the
Democratic County Committee. Hlckey'a
speech was one of the most forceful of
the evening and won from his auditors
rounds of applause. He said:
We meet here to-night aa citlzena of this
great city of San Francisco, free of party
distinction. We have a great campaign before
us and we are going to win.
We have picked out a young, fearless ag
gressive, honest, high-principled man for our
leader, the man who Is destined to use his
valor, his Integrity and hlÂ« sincerity of pur-
POM to rescue our beloved city from ranina
and debauchery.
PEoÂ»-Â»,E AVAVT PARTRIDGE.
John 6. Partridge is going to be elected, and
elected because thÂ« honest people of this com
munity want him.
. P*,..P cat "}*"** Â«t* n <i for decency and
fair flings Al over our nation, in New
York, in Philadelphia, in Boston In Chicago,
comes up" the great cry that the' corrupt gov.
i err.ment of our cities is the scandal of our
nation.
For several years past It has been almost
an impossibility for people entering -into pol
itics to break away from bos*eÂ«. Now the
time is h*re, when a decent citizen has Â«omÂ«
to the front, free from any boss, and Is to
'be elected for this very reason. In tbÂ« present
administration the charter has not been carried
out. This administration has been the most
corrupt and rotten administration that has
ever disgraced our city. We have been sold
for money. We have been delivered Into bond-\

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY^ OCTOBER '11, 1905.
WAITS IN VAIN
FOR THE MAYOR
Laro'e Crowd at Strieker's
Hall ' Disappointed by the
Chief Executive of * City
MAKES THREE SPEECHES
Utters His Cry Against the
Fiisioir Ticket and Then
Mysteriously "-* Disappears
Mayor Schmitz spoke at three meet
ings last night in widely separated sec
tions of the. city... He was billed to
appear at a fourth, Strieker's Hall.
Twenty-eighth and Church streets, but
for some reason he failed to turn up.
A large crowd waited patiently for
three hours while the " preliminary
speakers talked against time, but at
length they grew tired of sitting and
left the hall. The Mayor sent no word
In exDlanation of his failure to appear.
A large crovtrd greeted Mayor Schmitz
at Washington Square Hall, Union. and
Stockton streets, the heart of the Ruef
camp. He urged, all to vote the straight
ticket. He dwelt for the most part
upon his administration and on the
fact that the times had been prosperous
during his regime. As usual he de
rided the idea that graft existed at
the City "Hall, and stated that those
who were leading the opposition --vere
after what graft they could pick up.
"The reason that the capitalists and
larger merchants are fighting me," said
the Mayor, "is because tUey have not
one of their kind in office. They are
opposed to one who has sprung from
the ranks of the wage-earner and is
proud of the fact. They are disap
pointed because the wage-earners of
this city are better paid and are in
better condition than the toilers of any
other city in the world." %
A fair-sized audience was in attend
ance at Manzanlta Hall, Fourth and
Perry streets, the next stop. Here the
Mayor discussed the issues of the cam
paign and vilified the Citizens' Alliance.
The Railway Men's Hall, 664 Fourth
street, was .filled with men and boys.
Mayor Schmitz here, as everywhere,
urged every one present to attend the
ratification meeting at the Alhambra
Theater, to-night. The speakers of' last
evening were: G. F. Duffey, E. B.
Shortall, M. W. Coffey, J. H. Nelson, L.'
A. Rea, F. P. Nicholas, G. B. Ben ham,
Major C. W. Kyle, D. G. Colamun;
Thomas F. O'Neil, T. F. Lonergan, \V.
H. . Langdon, S. Wells Horton, Sam
Davis and James de Succa.
The Riggers' and Stevedores' Schraitz
Club was organized Stl2l New _ Mont
gomery street last evening. The officers
are P. D. Ilarthorn, president; Joiin H.
Dolan, sepretary, . and A. C. Holmes,
treasurer. Fifteen vice presidents and
five sÂ«rgeants-at-arms we^j chosen Reso
lutions commending Schmitz's adminis
tration were adopted. \u25a0'â¢
"The Star-Spangled Banner" was effec
tively rendered by the quartet and Mr.
Tobin then introduced Henry U. Bran
denstein. who was enthusiastically re
ceived. He said in part:
This is' essentially'"' a ratification pt Jolin.S.'
Partridge, but I ask leave to et^sak a word
In my own : behalf. I seem to have been
chosen as the special tarxet for ajl kinds Of
insinuations by the grafters. Let me assure
you that when I am elected District Attorney,
and I will be elected I will persecute nobody
and will protect nobody from Just punish
ment, not even If it is the chief executive
. of the city. , . ..."".'
' There is no graft? I tell you we who stand
here have seen it, lived through It, fought
against It ami under oath have testified to
It 3 existence.
If the gang wins the day it means the 1 tri
umphal aegrading of San Francisco. 1 trust
the voters, will show their Americanism on
election day by sweeping the gangsters Into
the bay arid -voting solidly for John S. Part
ridge. .
After paying a tribute to Samuel
Braunhart, who la at present, seriously
ill, Chairman Tobin introduced. General
C. A. Woodruff, whose witty remarks
made, a hit with the audience. General
Woodruff Â«aid: : .
SCHMITZ ENEMY OF LABOR.
We meet to ratify a ticket made necessary
by ineompetency and depravity, to confirm a
fusion made possible by patriotism, to pre
diet a victory made sure If every, citizens does
his \u25a0 duty. I shall address my remarks to or- ,
ganlzed labor, not . the sort that some Job
chasers claim to carry in their vest pockets,
but the other kind, the thinking kind. I claim
to have earned the right to speak to them, if
not for thorn. My lather was a New Eng
land farmer, where rocks were thicker than
potatoes, and where they breed worklngmen
of the thinklnc kind.
As a boy of 17, I "struck" on turning the
grindstone, threw down my hoe, and became a
"walking delegate" In the grandest labor union
>the world has ever known; and when our la
bor union blotted slavery from oft our statute
books, we did more for the. uplifting of work
ingmen than any other union our country, has
ever produced.
I believe in labor unions, but, like Samuel
Gompers and John Mitchell, I don't want to
see them In politics any more than I want to
see tho Grand Army in politics. It was rulu
ous'to the Grand Army in '68; if persisted In,
It will be ruinous to labor unions. I shall not
appeal to your prejudice, but to your patriot-
Ism, to your reason and to your civic pride.
Can union labor afford to Join hands with
the classes who do most to degrade worklng
raer. In upholding thÂ« sort of city government
we now have and such as we have had for the
past four years? Do respectable working
men and women, fathers and mothers, wish to
go on record as supporting a city government
that panders to those vices most corrupting to
tho younic of both sexes?
The Mayor claims to be the friend of labor;
"by their works ye shall know them." Can
honest fathers and mothers believe he Is their
friend, when he has the enthusiastic support
of evÂ«ry element that debauches mankind, de-
Etroys the home, that ruins your boys and
Remember, this is no ordinary political cam
paign, but one that should appeal to the wom
en of our city, the wives and mothers of our
voters, as well as to the voters themselves,
for It is a battle between decency and inde
cency, between the home and the dance hall,
between honesty and dishonesty. ' ,
If Mr Tartrldge were Mayor, with an hon
est, competent Board of Public Works, wa
could well all our $17,000,000 public Improve
ment bonds, and the resultant work would
give to labor millions; but to Mayor Schmitz
those millions for labor are aa nothing when
compared to the salaries and perquisites of dis
credited Commissioners. , \u25a0â¢\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0, .
I tnnt It wasn't labor union men who ran
riot on our streets a few weeks ago; it wasn't
Mayor Selimltz aloae who sÂ»nt those ruffians
out to abuse women, boys and men. I \u25a0 sin
cerely trust It wasn't labor union men that dis
graced themselves, the Mayor and tho city at
the recent Republican convention, and : I wish
I could say it wasn't the Mayor and his proxy
who sent those rowdies there. . -It was a
despicable, disgraceful, 'cowardly attempt to
stifle free speech, which, organized labor can
not aftord- to Indorse, and every decent :citi
xen should rebuke by his vote.": \u25a0-
.': .'At l the* close of Woodruffs speech Mr.
Partridge was Introduced and held the
entire audience with his every word. At
the conclusion of the candidate's
speech; Chairman. Tobin proposed three
cheers for Partridge, and, with the
shouts ringing in the air. the large au
dence slowly filed Into the streets.

THE QNLY'BEACHLOTS OBTAINABLE
. j. . at'Halfmoon Bay are located in the Ocean Beach Tract. -DON'T FORGET THIS.
When we; say that we are offering you -the BEST and CHOICEST property and the only Beach Lots obtainable, we mean just what we
say. There are other, lots, of course, but none possessing the. many advantages to be found in Ocean Beach Lots, for the following reasons:
T^T^i^f AT TO TZ? Â°N ACCOUNT OF THEIR UNINTERRUPTED MARINE VIEW.
â¢â¢ l tt"l^L>-/\- : LJ r>i~l ACCESSIBILITY TO THE BEACHâ HALFMOON BAY'S GREATEST ATTRACTION.
z-^ 7 -r\f^ NEARNESS TO THE OCEAN SHORE DEPOT.
Every ocean, steamer. and craft of any description traversing the great Pacific between San Francisco and all Southern ports can be seen
from any part of the. Ocean Beach Tractâ A -clean sweeping view of Old Ocean that nothing obstructs.
People owning lots in this tract will have but a few steps to take to the cars â running to and from Halfmoon Bay.
Location of depot being near the beach, the business of the town will center there, making Ocean Beach Lots valuable for business and
residence as well, ; ; \u25a0 . /
The" lots are" large, permitting spacious grounds for amusements or other purposes.
40 Minutes From San Francisco â No Transfersâ All Lots Situated a Few Feet From the Ocean
The most choice in the district offered at prices that permit of quick returns, and large profits to investors.
The gigantic plans of the Ocean Shore Railroad Company and the Ocean Shore Development are gradually becoming known, and to those
who have kept in touch with the movements of these great corporations and understand the geographical position of this most beautiful of sea-
side resorts, will readily understand its' great possibilities as a place for investment.

HIS ATTITUDE
Special Cable to The" Call.
HONDLULU, Oct. 10. â Congressman
Bourke Cockran arrived here' to-day
from the Orient on the America Maru.
He said:
"I was- always and am now opposed
to the Philippines and Hawaii, but now
that .they are in the fold, I have put
my shoulder to the wheel. Mark my
word, the Philippines will be for the
plunderers, though Roosevelt is doing
his best for their Interests."
Cockran went to the Philippines to
investigate the Question of their reten
tion.' He is intensely interested in the
insurance investigation and asked for
all the papers with the news of the
inquiry.
Superintendent C. B. Miner of the
Holland Submarine Company; H. L.
Brake and several electricians, were
passengers on the America Maru from
the Yokosuku naval station, whÂ«re they
assembled the parts of the submarines
shipped from America during the war.
Neither Japan nor Russia used sub
marines at all. The vessels were not
completed in Japan until just before
the treaty bf peace.' Miner says he has
positive knowledge that no submarines
were used in any naval battle during
the war. ?,

HEARST TO TRY
FOR MAYORALTY
NETV YORK. Oct. 10.â William Ran
dolph Hearst to-night made public a let
ter addressed to Judge Samuel Seabury
of the Municipal Ownership League, ac
cepting the league's recent tender of a
nomination for Mayor of New York. The
municipal convention of the organization
will be held on Thursday, but Mr. Hearst
was offered the nomination at a meeting
Borne days ago. His acceptance assures
three Mayoralty tickets In the field this
fallâ the Democratic, Republican and Mu
nicipal Ownership League. In his letter
of acceptance Mr. Hearst said in part:
\u25a0 I have felt absolutely unable and unwilling
to accept the nomination you have offered me,
but I have at length decided to defer to your
wishes and not to shirk a task that presents
itself to me as a public duty.
The situation In this city Is so grave and
the condition of the public in the face of
organized bossism Is apparently so helpless
that no man has a right to consider anything
else, least of all his private acralrs or personal
inclination.
The one thing to be considered 1b the neces
sity of giving the people an opportunity to
vote for gome man of whom it may at least
be eald that he would, if elected, represent
those that voted for him and .not any boss
or corporation or selfish private interest.
If your convention believes that I am such
a man I shall accept the nomination. It is
Intolerable, In view of the recent exposures
of the gas trust and the Insurance frauds,
that the Interests of the citizens should be
.allowed to go, by default. "
The letter of Mr. Hearst was read at a
meeting of the committee of seventeen to
night. Former, Senator John Ford was
agreed upon for Comptroller and James G.
Phelps Stokes for president of the Board
of Alderman. The committee announced
that Mr. Ford had a.greed to accept and
that Mr. Stokes had tentatively accepted.
The committee considered the matter of
platform, one plank of which will de
clare for municipal ownership, pending
which "we favor short term leases/with
power of resumption by the city upon
adequate compensation for the capital in
vested."
Among the organizations represented at
the meeting were the Greater New York
Municipal Ownership League, which will
hold Its convention on Thursday night;
the Municipal Ownership League of
Brooklyn, which will formally indorse
Mr. Hearst and the other ' candidatea
probably on Friday night; the German-.
American Municipal League, the Work
ingmen's Municipal Ownership League
and the Citizens' Union, August H. Steb
blns Â«ecretary of the - committee, being
a Citizens' Union man. :

COULD HOLDS
THE WHIP HAND
TOLEDO, Ohio, Oct. 10. â No directors
were, chosen at the annual meeting of
the Wabash to-day. The sessions, with
tho exception of two brief recesses,
lasted from 9 o'clock in the morning
until 11:15 at. night, almost the entire
time being taken up by the examina
tion of proxies.
Although no figures have been given
out, it is believed that the vote to be
taken to-morrow will show that Gould
has behind him about $22,000,000 of the
bonds and that Ramsey has in the
neighborhood of $2,0U0,000. This makes
certain that the six men nominated by
the Gould faction as directors repre
senting the bondholders will be elected.
These men are Russell Sage. Wlnslow
S. Pierce, E. T. Welles, TV. B. Saunder.
R. C. dowry and E. D. Galloway. Ram
sey has not shown sufficient strength
to enable him to hold his seat as a di
rector and it is believed he is weaker
in stock proxies than he Is in the bond 3.
At the night session Ramsey's attor-.
neys took the position that no man
should be* allowed to vote unless he Is
the actual owner of stock at the time
of the meeting. They submitted af
fidavits covering about $1,000,000 bonds,
in which the affiants declare them
selves the actual owners of stock which
stood in other names on the stock list
at the time the books were closed prior
to the election. The proxies for this
stock had been given to Gould In
every Instance and the persons de
claring themselves the present owners
had given proxies to Ramsey. Chief
among these was James R. Keen*, who
gave a proxy for ' $212,000. and J. "W.
Hennlng & Co. of New York, who gave
one for $154,000.
The Inspectors ruled against Ramsey
In every instance, holding that the
bonds could only be voted by the per
sons In whose name they stood at the
time of the closing of the books.

Out to Spend the Evening
and Escapes With Loot
PITTSEURG. Oct. 10.â The startling
discovery was made late to-day that
the Adams Express Company has been
victimized to the extent of $100,000,
supposedly through the peculations of
\u25a0 an employe.. The following official
statement of the affair Is given for
publication:
"At 4:30 p. m., Monday. October 9,
a bank of Pittsburgh delivered to the
Adams Express Company, at Its office
610 Wood street, Pittsburg, a pack
age of currency, containing $100,000.
â¢Va* amourt SSO.OOO vt-as ln 5100 bllu
53 0.000 in $50 bills, and the remainder.
110,000, in 55. $10 and $20 bills. The
package containing this large sum of
. money was consigned to a bank in
â¢ Cincinnati.
"This package was received and re
ceipted for by Edward George Cunliffe,
who was then acting in the place of
the regular money clerk, who was ill.
"Cunliffe left the office at the usual
time last evening, and this morning,
when he failed to report for duty, a
hurried examination was made of his
department and it was learned that
about $1000 of funds entrusted to his
care was missing. General Agent
Hiner of the Adams Express Company
called in detectives and placed the mat
. ter ln their hands. Later developments
brought to light the fact that, in addi
tion to the SlOOO missing, the bank's
package containing the $100,000 had
not been received at the money for
warding office at the Union station in
this city.
"Inquiries made at his residence. 314
Lucerne street. West End, Plttsburg,
showed that Cunliffe arrived home at
the customary time last evening, and
after changing his clothes bade his
family good-'oy. saying to his wife
that he was going out for the evening.
Nothing further has been heard from
him.
"Cunliffe has been employed by the
Adams Express Company sirvce March 1,
Previous to that time he was
in the Pittsburg service of
the American Express Company, the
Electric Express Company and the
United States Express Company of
Hartford. Conn., and bore a good repu
tation. He was methodical, accurate
and an excellent clerk."
A warrant has been issued charging
Cunliffe with larceny.
HUNGARY TO EXJOY
TEX WEEKS' TRUCE
Diet Is Prorogued and Ne
gotiations With Crown
Will Continue.
BUDAPEST, Hungary, Oct. 10.â The
Hungarian Diet was prorogued to-day
until December 19, without any unto
ivard incident beyond the displays of
angry sentiment on the part of the
united opposition in the Lower House.
This gives a breathing space of ten
\u25a0weeks for further negotiations between
the crown and the coalition, but the
chances for an agreement are regarded
as slim. The coalition appears to Vie
willing to play a waiting game, In the
conviction that the necessities of the
Government with regard to money, re
cruits and commercial treaties .will
torce the crown to consent to a settle
ment.
General Baron Fejervary will go to
Vienna to-iriorrow or Thursday to sub
"V mlt reports to the King-Emperor and
I to await his Majesty's decision regard
ing his reappointment as Premier or the
acceptance of his resignation.
To reassemble the Diet before the
end of the jear offers the possibility
of the legal election of a Hungarian
delegation, but as it Is not likely that
Parliament will make the necessary ap
pointments, the crown probably v.'ill be
obliged to provide for the common ex
penditures of the' monarchy without
delegations and -ivithout the sanction
of the Hungarian Parliament.

ELECTION COMMISSIONER ROBERTS MEETS
DEATH FROM THE BITE OF RATTLESNAKE
Election Commissioner Robert W. Roberts died Monday night at Calisloga as the result of an unusual
accident. He was bitten by a rattlesnake which had been shot to pieces, while he was out hunting with a party
of, friends. The head of the snake, the only tart of the reptile left, suddenly threw out its poisonous fangs,
-which fastened on Roberts* right forefinger, causing his death twenty-four hours- later. .

Election Commissioner Robert W.
Koberts died Monday night at Calistoga
as the result of a bite from a rattle
snake he received near the Little
Geysers last Sunday. Roberts, with a
party that included Fred Muller and
Otto turn iSuiien, an attorney, left this
city on a pleasure trip last Thursday
and was camping t Pine Flat, a few
miles above Calistoga.
On Sunday at noon, the party went
for a stroll and soon encountered a
large rattlesnake. Muller carried a
gun and shot the reptile into pieces.
The p::rty stood about lor several min
utes discussing the immense size of the
reptile s head, which was the only part
not blown to pieces. Roberts reached
forth to pick up the head and at that
instant the rattlesnake's poisonous
tangs darted forth and fastened on
Roberts' right forefinger. With a gasp
of horror Roberts cried out:
"My God, boys, I'm bit!"
Roberts' hand began to swell up to
a large size and remedies usual In such
cases were applied at once. As no im
provement was noticed in the sufferer's
condition arrangements were made to
take him to Calistoga. Arriving there,
Dr. H. L. Parish was immediately sum
moned, but Roberts was beyond medical
aid and he passed away at midnight
Monday. The body was shipped to this
city and now lies at Porter & White's
undertaking parlors.
Roberts was 45 years of age and
leaves a widow. He was appointed
Election' Commissioner by Mayor
Schmltz ln January, 1903, and his term
would have expired in 1907. Roberts
was associated wi^, tne Eagle Laundry
Company and was well liked by all who
knew him.

WIFE BEATER
GOES INSANE
William O'Dougherty, who threw his
7 months' old babe against the ceil
ing, breaking its right leg, and who
beat his wife when she tried to inter
fere, became violently insane in his
prison cell in the Central police sta
tion last evening. But for the presence
of mind of Officer John Maloney,
O'Dougherty's cellmate might have
been seriously hurt.
In the early part of the evening the
police were attracted to the cell by
a call for help. The door of the cell
was opened by the automatic spring
and Maloney, a well-built and trained
athlete," went to the assistance of
O'Dougherty's cellmate, who by this
time was being choked by the enraged
lunatic.
O'Dougherty immediately attacked
the officer and a hard struggle . fol
lowed. Maloney managed to drag
O'Dougherty from the cell into the of
fice part of the prison, where several
! of the other officers and some of the
trusties came to his assistance. John
Bolen, a trusty, was badly bitten on
the hand and several of the policemen
received minor scratches.
O'Ddugherty was linally subdued and
sent to the. Emergency Hospital to
await an examination before the
Lunacy Commission.
O'Dougherty was arraigned in court
yesterday' afternoon, and, after some
damaging testimony by his little 13
year-old daughter the Judge raised the
crime to a felony and set the case for
hearing to-day. Owing to the later
phases of the. man's conduct the hear
ing will" be postponed.
Detectives J. McGown, T. Conlon
and A. Martine swore to a complaint
late yesterday evening . charging
Thomas Fitzpatrlck and Bernard
Duffy with burglary. Fitzpatrick and
Duffy are very important witnesses ;
against O'Dougherty and after his ar
rest he charged them both with bur
glary.
The police at first took little stock :ln
the charge, but after a thorough Inves
tigation by the detectives they now be
lieve they can at least connect the two
men' with' Patrick Bogan, who was
caught while robbing a saloon on the
corner of Howard and East streets
about a month ago.

Everybody Who . Gave Evi
dence Against His Client
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 10.â Grove' X
Johnson was the central ngure in the
JSmmona trial to-day. He played upon
the jury with the skill "of an accom
plished musician who touches a chord
that enthralls. All day long he, painted
vivid word pictures for the_jurors to
look upon and punctuated his points
with a withering invective, that poured
indiscriminately upon the heads : of
those who had taken the initiative in
the prosecution of his client. District
Attorney Seymour came in, for his
share; .Charles T. Jones, who has as
sisted in the prosecution <of the case,
learned that the Haying he received at
the hands of Lawyer Irwin was hardly
a marker to what was in store for him;
Clarence Grange was subjected to an
analysis that did not sound well; the
alleged methods employed by Gavin
McNab In his "high souled" bribery
was held up in remarkable colors and
had all the changes in the book rung
upon it; Fremont Older had his chance
with the attorney; Jordan was held up
as something less than a man, but a
little more tnan Grange, and Hartling
and Tichenor, the detectives, were
shown up in colors that were anything
but flattering.
Mr. Johnson went to his work as
fresh, apparently, as If he had been
resting for the past month instead of
fighting for his client Â«.s only he knows
how to light. His points followed each
other with a precision and sequence
that made his story complete in every
detail.
- Mr. Johnson paid a high compliment
to Judge Hart tor his absolute fairness
in the trial of the case. In this he
voiced the sentiment of his client, Em
mons,- who, after the testimony was in,
personally thanked the Judge for his
fairness.
Attorney Johnson grilled Charles T.
Jones for the point in his argument
touching upon the domestic affairs, of

JOHN SABIN DIES
AT HOME IN CITY
THREE WOMEN
VOTED FAMOUS
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â Three women and
five men were chosen to-day to receive
tablets in the Hall of Fame at New
York University. Maria Mitchell was the
only American scientist to be#elected at
this time, though Louis Agassiz, with 82
votes, secured admission as a foreign
born American.
A curious commentary on Maria Mit
chell's election Is the fact that eight of
the electors, chiefly scientists, refused
to vote for any woman, thus reducing
the number of votes necessary to elect a
woman to 47, while 51 were required for a
man.
Mary Lyon, founder of Mount Holyoke
College, and Emma Willard, the author
of "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep"
and, a famous educator, were the other
women honored.
Alexander Hamilton, with 87 votes, the
highest number received by any candidate
at thjs ' election, and John Paul Jones,
with.<s3. share with Agassiz the honors of
being the first " American immortals of
foreign birth.
Two American statesmen were chosen
â John Quincy Adams, whose tablet will
occupy a niche next to that of his fa
ther, John Adams, he having received
58 votes, and James Madison, who se
cured admission with 56 votes.
Patrick Henry, John C. Calhoun and
Andrew Jackson fell far short of securing
bronze tablets of record, and Samuel
Adams was again defeated. James Mon
roe's votes numbered only 23. Seward,
Sumner, Da Witt Clinton, Garfleld, John
Jay and Stanton were among the states
men who failed of election.

Continued from Pace 1, Column 7.
May, 1903, he returned to San Francisco
as president of the Pacific States Tele
phone Corapapy.
In the electrical world Mr. Sabin was
regarded as one of the best-informed
men on appliances in this country, and
he combined with his knowledge of the
telephone business ability that made
the local company one of the moat suc
cessful in the United States. While
the beat part of his time was taken up
by his business Interests, Mr. Sabin
enjoyed social life to some degree, and
at one time publicly participated in the
political affairs of San Francisco, and
served a term as a member of the
Board of School Directors.
It was Mr. Sabin who conceived the
idea of giving San Francisco comfort
able telephone buildings, the designs
of which are among the most attractive
!n this city. He also suggested the de
signo for the new big structures that
the telephone company Is now erecting
and, at the time of his death he had
many other plans under consideration
for the improvement of the coast serv

of danger were the many residences on
the hills bordering Fourth avenue, in

home of Frank M. Smith, the borax

The fire was independent of that
which scoured the Berkeley Hills yes

Take
Care
Of Your Heart.
It is the engine that forces
the blood to every part of the
body; this blood conveys the
nourishment that makes flesh,
bone and muscle; it also car-
ries off the worn-out particles.
If the heart flutters or palpi-
tates, it is weak, and is work-
ing .imperfectly, so that the
body does not get this nourish-
ment ; it also fails to throw off
the impurities, and they re-
main to poison the system.
If it is irregular, skips beats,
or is painful, the heart is prob-
ably "leaky" and the circulation
poor. These conditions, are
dangerous. You can make
your heart well, and keep it
so, with Dr. Miles' Heart Cure,
which is a heart medicine and
tonic that strengthens the
heart nerves and muscles.
"I have been a sufferer for years
from nervousness and weak heart, and
I have tried all the doctors in the
community. They all told me that I
had heart trouble, but they failed to
help me. My druggist prevailed upon
me to try Dr. Miles' Heart Cure, and
Restorative Nervine, saying that if
tha first bottle did not benefit me he
v.-ould return the money. Every doso
helped me from the time I began tak-
ing it, and after awhile my trouble

PROPOSE A NEW
LICENSE LAW
Trustees of Berkeley Plan
tfr Number of Sa
loons and to Increase Tax
BERKELEY, Oct. 10.â The Board of
Town Trustees has ordered passed to print
an ordinance limiting the number of
saloons in Berkeley to ten, and raising
the license tax from $300 a year to $600.
The license committee presented the ordi
nance for approval last night, having re
recelved a draft of the measure from
Attorney H. H. Johnson. There was no
discussion of the ordinance, as the pass
ing of it to print is a preliminary step
which Is not considered to commit the
Trustees to Its final adoption.
President Rlckard recommended several
months ago that the number of saloons
be reduced and the tax be raised,' and
also favored selling the licenses at auc
tion to the highest bidder. The auction
feature was not Included In 'the ordi
nance which the license committee pre
sented for approval last night. 'Â«
There are now 23 saloons In Berkeley,
of which 20 are in West Berkeley. All
are outside the "mile limit." The tem
perance people of Berkeley have favored
their entire abolition, and a petition to
the Trustees In now on file, asking that
a special election be called to decide the
question of prohibiting the drinking
places. Whether the temperance advo
cates will permit their agitation for pro
hibition to cease, now that a high license
law has been proposed, remains to be de
termined. The new ordinance, which is
regarded as a compromise measure, con
tains a provision which is expected to
please those favoring strict regulation of
saloons, In that licenses are to be re
fused to places that have card room, bil
liard hall or dancing room attached, or
that do business in drugs or groceries.

CORDIAL PRAISE
University President For

for Fighting Big Fire
BERKELEY, Oct. 10.â The university
students who yesterday gave up the
day to fighting (ire on the hills and
in the canyons back of tne campus to
day received congratulations and words
of praise from many quarters for their'
work.
President Wheeler issued through
his secretary the following: expression
of approval, addressed to the student
body: \u25a0 \u25a0
The president wishes to express to the
students cf the university his appreciation of
their intelligent, vigorous and Intrepid work
in defeating the peril which yesterday threat
ened the buildings of the university and the
homes of its neighbors. â¢ . . .
There was an abundance of evidence
on.- the persons of students that' yes-]
terday had been a strenuous day for
them. Scores wore court plaster on'
their faces and hands, covering wounds
and burns received. Not a few appeared
with elnged eye brows and hair, and
almost all were. obliged to dress in dif
ferent garb than that with which they
went to the flre on the hills, r..--' -;
The hills back pf the. university are
now bare and black, hundreds of acres
having been completely denuded' of
every bit of plant life. The path of
the flames is easily discerned to-day,
now that the smoke has all cleared
away, and it is seen? how -very close
to the campus buildings and the Clare
mont residences the lire came, and how
great the peril to the town really was.
Fire Chief Kenney was called out
twice to-day by inmates of Judge Gar
ber's house, In Claremont, who feared
the lingering patches of flre in the vi
cinity. The first call came at 4 o'clock
this morning. The chief assured tha
Garber household that no danger' need
be apprehended, but despite his assur
ances he was called out again during
the forenoon. - .
There was no attempt made at either
time to stamp out. the flre in the hills
back of Judge Garber's place, ; as it
could ;be seen that- nothing in the way
of. material for the flre' in the vicinity
of the house, remained to make.it pos
sible for the buildings to' be imperiled.
Charles Butters, whose < handsome
home in Claremont was closer to the
path of the. flames, stayed up (most pf
the night, with* some of his neighbors,
prepared to have their men beat. back
the flre 'if 'â¢ it .should endanger resi

OAKLAND, Oct. 10.â Miss Annie Keller,
the young woman who with her mother
was buried beneath the ruins of their
house at Upper Fruitvale yesterday
when a fierce blast approaching a hurri
cane in its violence demolished the cotr
tage, has partly, recovered from the shock
of her nerve-racking" experience. She
wears bandages around her head where
she recelvd some "cuts and bruises and Is
still under the care of Dr. Crosby.
At the time the hquse was blown to
fragments Miss Keller was standing be
side a chiffonier ; at the entrance to , the
six-foot basement. The boards of the
main floor fell upon the chiffonier, in a
measure shielding the girl from severe if
not fatal Injuries. In telling her experi
ences Miss Keller to-day said: ,
"I felt the house shiver and sway; a
feeling akin to sea-sickness seemed to
take possession of me and then all was
blank until I recovered consciousness in'
the house of a neighbor after Dr. Crosby
had been called to resuscitate me. It was
an experience I do not care to go through
again."
Mrs. Keller had quite recovered j to-day
from the shock of yesterday. She was
protected in the basement when the floor
timbers fell crosswise above her, /and
succeeded in crawling out upon her hands
and knees unharmed. She is not dis
posed to discuss the incident.
When Mr. Keller arrived at the station
last night and was informed by a friend
of the fact that his wife and daughter
had narrowly . escaped death, he . col
ladsed. To-day he has a temporary tent
on the lot in which he and his two young
sons are living. He will erect a shed in
which to house his family until Con
tractor Neilson can rebuild the cottage.
Temporarily Mrs. and Miss Keller are
guests of sympathizing neighbors. The

SURPRISES HER
GUESTS WITH
WEDDING BELL
ZOE GREEK RADCLIFFE.
* OAKLAND, Oct. 10. â In this" strenuous
twentieth century, when seemingly impossible
things have become possible and we are no
longer surprised at anything, it Is. difficult to
ring in any changes on that "old, old story
that is ever new." A man and a maid marry,
there Is the usual complement of attendants
and the "how" and "where" we know by
heart. But to Invite fifty guests to a wedding
and keep them in ignorance of the fact that
It Is a wedding Is rather unusual. It remained
for Miss Belle Robins to devise this unique
marriage feast.
Cards were sent to half a hundred of the
family's Intimate friends, requesting their
presence at a reception in honor of Miss
Robins-f iance, "William Travis Burney. a
young attorney of Kansas City. When they
were ushered Into charmingly decorated apart
ments, with a bridal bower and wedding bells
In one room, the secret almost revealed Itself,
but It was a very mischievous looking little
bride that â¢ read the general surprise, when.
Boon. after ,th.c. arrival of the guests, she be
came Mrs. Burney.
Neither ; veil . nor conventional bouquet were
part of- the bride's costtime. The gown -was
a beautiful white samite over white silk of
very. modish make, while Â»a- cluster of lllies-of
â¢ the-valley reposed -in her- hair, .and pinned to
the'; corsage was the groom's gift, a double
bar' set with diamonds. '
Miss Dollle McKown of . Livermore and Miss
Mabel Heald attended the bride, while the
groom was accompanied by. two fraternity
brothers. Jack Kggers and Karl Mulllcan. The
two bridesmaids were gowned alike In dainty
frocks of pink Jusl cloth over silk of the, same
shade, and the ' coiffures were adorned with
ribbon ornaments. .
The bower where I>r. C. R. Brown of the
Congregational Church made the happy couple
one was. of . shaggy white chrysanthemums and
three "white ' bells depended from the arch.
Autumn effects were maintained In all the
decorations, the dining-room being especially
artistic with festoons of autumn leaves and
clusters of grapes.
The bride Is a daughter of Judge and Mrs.
George Robins of Telegraph avenue, and an
interesting anniversary added to the pleasant
feeling of romance that prevailed. It was on
October 10, 1856, that Judge Robins arrived
In California. For over fifteen years he oc
cupied the bench In San Francisco.
The \u25a0\u25a0 groom, though a resident -of Kansas
City, is a University of California graduate and
a member of the Phi Kappa Psl.
Mr and Mrs. Burney will enjoy a visit to
Southern California before â¢ going to their
future home In, Kansas City.
When It was announced that Mrs. Frederick
Stratton would have charge of the musical
enS- of to-day's programme at Ebell, that for
tunate club' prepared to go and enjoy. But
the reality exceeded even their rosiest expecta
tions. Nearly everybody had heard Fred
Maurer, that prince of accompanists, at some
time or other and were eager and delighted
to hear him again, but an unexpected treat
was In store in Miss Louvla Rogers. Not yet
sixteen, her voice Is rarely sweet and rich
and gives evidence of careful and Intelligent
training. Several delightful selections were
rendered by the young singer with exquisite
taste and the echo song which she grave as
an encore was repeated at the end of the
programme by reauest.' . -
Mr. Maurer played Rubensteln's "Barcarolle
in .F" and the prelude to "Parsifal" In the
muslclanly fashion he has taught us to expect.
It was Mr. Maurer who accompanied the â¢ Heer
manns In Ban Francisco and helped to make
their concert one of the most delightful
muÃlcal events of the year.. â¢

ANCIENT THEFT IS
AT LAST KEVEALED
Postofflce Itobbery Half Cen
tury Old Recalled by
Bundle of Letters.
OAKLAND, Oct. 10. â What is believed
to be the clew to a postoffice burglary
which occurred fifty-two years ago in
Alameda County was discovered to-day
when workmen were engaged In de
molishing an old building at East
Twelfth street and Twelfth avenue,
East Oakland. In 1853 the building in
question _wais occupied by the Clinton
postoffice and an express office. In De
cember of that year burglars robbed
both offices', taking several thousands
of dollars in gold- slugs.
Uncle Sam's mail sack was rifled and
Its contents disappeared. The thief was
never appreheded nor was the mail re
covered. To-day a moldy bundle of
letters and papers was found, when a
wall of the old building was torn down.
There was a draft for $100, addressed
to Francis Stead, from the New Orleans
banking house of Horace Bean & Co.
It is dated September 30, 1853, and was
never paid. The draft was drawn on
Jacob Little & C 0.,, NejviYoxk. ;
Other letters, whiclfc'are only in part
decipherable, were in the bundle. One
was addressed- to Ezra Fenten, or Fen
ter; another to Marshal Minot.'a third
was signed by- Hulse Pefcrez of New
Orleans and made inquiries about Cali
fornia gold fields. A crowd of excited
persons has been all afternoon search
ing for the stolen $50 slugs'.

Efforts to Keep Out Testi

EXJPEBT ON THE STAND
Captain Bartlett Allowed
to Give Evidence Despite
Objections by Officers
{ . â¢ -
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
VALLEJO, Oct. 10. â The second day
of the court-martial of Commander
Lucien Young at the ilare Island navy
i yard was productive of a great deal of
wrangling. The principal trouble of
the day was due to an effort to keep
out the testimony of Commander F. W.
Bartlett, who was introduced as an ex
pert witness by the prosecution.
Captain J. C. Bull or the United State*
steamship Solace, who is a member
of the court, was the first to object to
Bartlett's testimony, asking if Bart
lett had not expressed an opinion on
the verdict which tha board should
render in Young's case. Bartlett de
nied the allegation, and then Com
mander J. E. Roller, retired, asked it
Bartlett had not discussed the case with
many persons, soma of whom have
been witnesses in tha case. , '.:â¢â¢â¢ g
Bartlett warmed up under these ac
cusations and entered 'on a long and
hotly delivered explanation of his con
duct. He said that ha had discussed
the case with a number of naval of
ficers, but only to be able to form a
more correct opinion. He admitted that
he did state that he trusted that
< Young would be proved innocent. Just
as he would express a wish to sea any
fellow officer cleared of a charge If
he were innocent.
Bartlett then proceeded to give hi*
testimony, but Rear Admiral Glass.
â¢ after a conference with the members of
, the board, asked Bartlett if ha bad not
talked with three witnesses directly
about the matter under consideration.
Bartlett denied trying to* influence of
ficers and witnesses with whom he had
conversed on the subject, and after a^
long deliberation he was allowed ts>
testify. * \u25a0'\u25a0
His evidence was largely of a tech
nical nature and of no particular in
terest to the public, with the exception
of his opinion on the condition of the
valve on boiler B, which, he stated.
was rusty.
Lieutenant Victor Blue was recalled
for a few minutes this morning and
stated that he had no direct knowledge
of the discipline In the boiler-room
while he was executive officer of the
Bennlngton. Generally speaking, he
said, the discipline of the ship was ex
cellent.
Xaval Constructor Holden A. Evans,
who is one of Young's counsel, was put
on the stand this morning and identi
fied many of the parts of tne ship's
boilers which he had taken from, tha
Bennlngton and tested. Evans .was
about to ' express an opinion -on "the"
cause of the explosion and the'condi
tion of the boilers and valves, when an
objection by Judge Advocate West,
which was sustained by the board,
stopped him. Evans told of the test
ing of the rivets and the plates of tha
boilers, evidently intending to prove
by his testimony that the material used
in the construction of the boilers is de
fective. He also told of having tested
the safety valve of boiler "C" and
found that it raised at 140 pounds
water pressure.
Emil Frederlcksen. water tender,
was called. He l<s the only survivor of
the engine room crew. He told of the
scaling of boiler "B" at San Franclscq^
previous to the ship's vi3lt to Honolu
lu. The job was a "hurry-up" one, he
Â«3ald. When asked If it was a good one
Frederlcksen said "It would pass."
i He said the boiler had been refilled
under his supervision on the morning:
of July 21 and that it had not been
pumped out or examined after being;
emptied on the Bennington's arrival
at San Diego.
The day after the explosion Freder
icksen said he visited, the engine room
with Ensign Wade and examined the
stopcock of boiler "B" and found It
closed. His evidence was not consid
ered satisfactory.
J. G. Du3tln, bollermaker of the Ben
nington. testified that he had been at
tached to the ship for thirteen months
previous to the catastrophe, but that
he had seldom been on duty In the
fire room at the time Inspections had
been made. Occasionally, he said.
Young vteited that section of the Ben
nlngton.
Commander Bartlett was the last
witness called to the stand, and he was
still in the chair when the court ad
journed for the day. .Â»:â¢.*>,."\u25a0

McCurdy Gives His
Ideas as to in
surance
NEW YORK. Oct. 10.â The sessions of
the insurance investigating committee
were terminated lor the week at the ad
journment to-day, because of the death
of S. Fred Niron. speaker of the As
sembly of the Legislature of New York,
at his home in Westneld.
The feature of to-days hearing was
the presence as witness of the executive
t- officers of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company. These were President Richard
A McCurdy and Vice Presidents Grannis
and Dr. Gillette. It v.as announced defin
itely by Dr. Gillette that the Mutual Life
Insurance Company contributed $43,000
to the Republican national committee last
fall, that in 1900 $35,000 was contributed
and in ISS6 SIo.OOO was given for cam
paign purposes. Dr. Gillette testified that
be paid these amounts personally In cash,
and later in the day McCurdy said that
while he knew camnaign contributions
had been made, he did not know the
amounts. He said that no contributions
had ben made to campaign committees
before 1536 and that no contribution to
State or municipal campaigns had ever
been made by the company in this or any
other Stale.
Vice President Grannis knew little
about the contributions to campaign
funds, but justified them on the same
ground as President John A. McCall of
the New York Life, that the free silver
plank in the Democratic platform was a
menace to the interests of the policy
holders.
President McCurdy was on the stand all
cf the afternoon session. Toward the
close of the session McCurdy made the
startling statement that an insurance
company was nor an institution founded
to make money for the policy holders,
tut was, or should be. a great philan
thropic enterprise founded to increase and
tpread Its benefits over the entire uarth.
"There has been a jfreat mistake
made," he said, "about the real
j rovince of life insurance companies in
#'-ese latter years. People have been
.Y-d to believe that the main purpose was
to make money for the policy holders.
In my view, that is not the purpose of
such conipaiilef. ; They are eleemosynary.
When a man insures to s. company he
should take into consideration the fact
that he has entered a great philanthropic
concern that is in duty bound to spread
Itself, even though this growth prevents
him from realizing as much as expected."
OLVPUAXT OX THE STAND.
The first witness was Robert Olyphant,
chairman of the expenditure committee
of the Mutual Life Insurance Company.
From him it was expected to learn what
became of J7s,<X>o charged to legal expen
ditures. This sum was spent in three in
stallments of J25.000 each, the last in
stallment being paid the day after the
Presidential election last year.
Olyphant said there is no limit to the
money ."he committee on expenditures
may authorize to be paid out. The Mu
tual Life. Insurance Company maintains
a confidential fund for legal expenditures.
The details of payments for this fund
were not brought before the Board of
Trustees, but merely the total amounts.
Hughes, of the investigating boar"d,
then read the by-laws governing the ex
penditure of the committee and calling
for reports of expenditures to this com
mittee. Witness said no reports were
made.
The legal expenses of the company for
1904 were reported at 53C4.000, while those
of the New York Life Insurance com
pany were $174,000 and those of the Eqult
ftMe" $204,000.
"!% Witness said that A. C. Fields, super
intendent of the supply department, re
ceives a salary of $10,000 a year, but had
not looked after this department for sev
eral years owing to ill health. His duties
ere transacted by a Mr. Norris, whose
ealary he did not know.
It was brought, out that more than $72,
000 had been spent last year in furnishing
meals to employes.
McCI'RDY OX THE RACK.
Richard A. McCurdy, president of the
Mutual Life Insurance Company, testi
fied that he was 71 years old and a mem
ber of the bar. having been admitted in
3SSC. He practiced law for nine years
and "got Into the insurance business
quite accidentally."
He was elected attorney to the Mutual
In 1863 and served five years. A con

HIS BACK UP
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX BERNARDINO. Oct. 10.â A shoe
salesman from St. Louis made the ac
quaintance of Walter Scott, the Death
Valley miner, at Victorville recently.
Scott had just arrived at Victorville
with a sack of ore, with which he had
dodged from Barstow and entered a
store in time to hear the salesman say:
"Yes, I have some shoes for you desert
rats." Scott strode over and said, "I
may be a desert rat, but just try me if
you don'f believe me as good a man as

Scott, iWhile on his way to Los An
geles to-day from Barstow, stopped off
here and wired to President Harriman
of the Southern Pacific that he had
heard that he (Harriman) was contem
plating an attempt to break the record
across the continent. Scott offered to
bet Harriman he would beat him to
Chicago, Harriman to go from San
Francisco over the Southern Pacific
and Scott to take the Santa Fe from
Los Angeles, the distance to Chicago
being about the same from both points.
The cum named as a wager by Scott is
$35,000, with a.n additional $15,000 "for
side bets," the loser to pay for both
trains.
surance Company. Charles H. Raymond
was Us president.
Hughes asked McCurdy If he knew any
condition of competition that warranted
his company paying Charles H. Raymond
& Co. a rate that enables them to make
$200,000 a year net. After several ques
tions by Hughes, McCurdy said: "I know
of no such condition of competition .In
New York or anywhere else."
McCurdy said he had not given par
ticular attention to the' matter of salaries
in late years.. When. his salary was ad
vanced from JlOO.OOO to $150,000, it was
done by the committee on salaries. He
never in his life made a reauest fdr an
advance in salary. Witness took the ad
vance as a mark of appreciation of his
work. He would have continued his ser
vices whether his salary was increased
or not. "I certainly did not interpose
an objection." he said, referring to the"
raise In his salary.
It was brought out. that the witness
and Dr. Gillette held enough proxies of
policy holdprs to control the board of
trustees by electing its members.
On the subject of competition Mc-
Curdy explained that the high rates
were forced by other companies and the
Mutual Life had to pay enough to: keep
the services of its agents.

HOPES TO ROUT
CONSUMPTION
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, "Oct. 10.â That consump
tion in cattle can be made to disap
pear entirely within five years and the
human race thereby be safeguarded
against infection by this disease
through the use of the milk of cattle
not immunized is the . assertion of Pro
fessor Wilfred Lellman of the Veterin
ary School of the New York University.
x'or a year Professor Lelfinan has
been inoculating heifers, and calvos
with tubercle bacilli taken -.from the
human system. In every case treated
the. cattle, he reports, have-- become
strong and healthy and immune from
the disease. .< .
During the period in which Profes
sor Lellman has been experimenting
with Dr. Behring's bovovaccine he has
treated more than 100 calves and heifers,
injecting tubercle bacilli into the jugu
lar vein and noting the resulting symp
toms. From the moment the discovery
by Dr. Behring was made, Dr. Lellman,
who has been making experiments of
his own along similar lines, accepted
Dr. Behring f s theory and put it into
practical use. Dr. Behring has long
maintained that cattle might be ren
dered immune and the milk of im
munized cows given .to consumptive pa
tients with curative results. Through
the efforts of Professor Lellman, the
State Department of Maryland has used
Dr. Behring's bovoi'accine and the re
sults obtained there will cause the na
tional bureau to take up the work.
Professor Lellman said to-day:'
Cattle { which I have inoculated are now
free -from tuberculosis and my -own Investi
gations have proved this. I am free to say
that .the cattle of the futuri will no more be
troqbled | with the disease which annually
carries | oft 'thousands of their , numbers and
Imperils 'the people who drink the milk of
consumptive j cows. . No infection . can come
from eating- the mÂ«at of an infected animal.
The bacilli do not . inhabit the muscles, but
attack -and are nourished by the parts of the
animal which do not go to market. - . \u25a0
. We are on. the eve of ' a . great discovery,
and I feel that Dr. Behring will' announce
a cure .for consumption for human beings
something In line with the treatment', he haa
successfully given to cattle. . - \u25a0 . ' . \u25a0 '

NEW YORK. Oct. 10.â When two. well
trained ball teams are pitted against
each other with the points covered by
men of acknowledged cleverness, there
is always a doubt as to the outcome un
til the game is completed. The truth of
this was proved to-day, when in the sec
end game of the world's championship
series, the Philadelphia champions of the
American League defeated the National
League champions on the Polo grounds.
Yesterday on the Philadelphia grounds
McGraw's men won from Manager Mack's
team by a score of 3 to 0, and to-day
when the latter visited this city they
Just reversed the score, shutting out the
Giants.
The visitors pul in their Indian pitcher.
Bender, with Schreckengost to handle
him, against McGinnity and Bresnahan.
The Athletics' '. battery was excellently
eupported. as was the local end for two
innings. But in the third inning Gilbert
made a costly error, which gave the vis
itors a lead that they never relinquished.
McGinnity was relieved In the latter half
of the eighth inning, Strang batting in
his stead and Ames going' into the box.
The change did not prove effective, how
ever.
GILBERT'S COSTLY ERROR.
In the third inning Schreck sent a
grounder to Gilbert, who threw wildly
to first, and the friends of the local team
groaned when the batter was safe. Ben
der made a neat Bacriflce. Hartzell tried
to send the ball to the boundary, but
\u25a0was an easy out. IÂ»rd, the next up, was
the right man in the pinch, as he singled
to oenter, pcoring Schreck Davis was
thrown out by Dahlen and the inning end
ed in favor of Philadelphia, which had
tallied one run.
There was a dingdong game of -fast
plays until the seventh inning, when it
looked as though the home team might
tie the score, but Donlin just got as far
as third, only to be left there after mak
ing a double and reaching that station
on a fly to right field. This was the near
est point to the home plate that Me-
Graw*s men managed to get.
Monte Cross struck out at the be
ginning of the eighth inning, but
Schreck singled to left. Browne made
a beautiful running catch of Bender's
foul fly. Hartzell then doubled to left,
but the relay throw from Mertes,
through Devlin, to the plate, was
dreppÃd; by Bresnahan and Schreck
ecored. This was another run made on
an error. Then Lord singled, bringing:

AMES GOES Uf TO PITCH.
In the latter half of the eighth inning
the visitors â¢ were charged with their
first misplay. Devlin had singled and
Lord had caught an easy fly from Gil
bert. Strang batted for McGinnity, but
fanned. Monte Cross' fumble of a
grounder -from Bresnahan gave .'some
hope of a tally, but this died away
when Browne was thrown out by Mur

Ames went into pitch for New York
in the first half of the ninth and gave
Lave Cross a base on balls. Seybold
flew to Donlin for the third time. Mur
phy singled and matters looked promis
ing for an addition to Philadelphia's
score, but Monte Cross fanned and
Schreck was an easy victim from Ames
to Gilbert.
Murphy's fumble of Donlin's grounder
was the second bad mark against th&
visitors. This happened at the opening
of the last half of the concluding
Inning. McGann drew a pass, but
Mertes flew to M. Cross. The next two
men, Dahlen and Devlin, met the same
fate, Murphy and Davis being respon
sible for their dismissal and the ending
of the game.
The Philadelphia team went back to
their home to-night and the New York
team will go to Philadelphia in the
morning to decide the third contest in
the series. . . .

PORTLAND; Oat. 10.â After winning
this afternoon's game, the Giants tossed ;
it off to the commuters. Big Jack Me- 'â¢
Lean, who usually performs in the most
creditable manner, had a kink or two in
his 'throwing wing, for he contributed
two weird tosses that aided the Oak
landers in amassing about four . of the
six aces registered by them during j the
matinee. Then on top of the big catch
er's erring proceedings "came a couple of
foozles by McHala and Sweeney, all of
which set at naught the excellent work
of tha blonde-headed Bill Essick, who
was on the hill for the locals.
Willie pitched grand ball, allowing five
bingles and fanning out eight of Pop's
crew, and in addition endeavored to set
an example to his team-mates in the
fielding line by accepting seven chances.
The few hits acquired by the leaders were
secured at times '.when Essick's battery
partner would slip up on trying to heave
the bali to one of the sacks in an effort
to head off a runner and the, result was
that they cavorted around the paths al
most at will. Score: . < â¢

Insane patients, made ' a great commotion at

the officers to remove them that ' caused the

his cell to be taken to Ukiah he fell upon
the Deputy Sheriffs who had him' in charge
with the ferocity of a wild animal, and prob

O'BRIEN SIGNS
WITH KAUFMANN
Billy Delaney's Discovery to
' iTeet Clever Philadelphian
Before Gre^ains' Club
MATCH A BIG A STJEPBISE
Articles Are Finally Drawn
Up Alter a Wrangle Over
Purse and Clean Breaks
Billy Delaney.has evidently altered
hia ,plan<3. concerning his clever young
heavy-weight, Al Kauf mann. for last
night: he, signed up the kid to box
Philadelphia Jack O'Brien before the
San Francisco Club on October 27.
O'Brien is one of \u25a0 the shiftiest lads in
the fighting game, and if everything 13
right, "Kauf mann will have an awful
time before the mill ends.
Kauf mann is going to have the ad
vantage in the weight, but this is not
such a graat big lead when the experi
ence and the ring generalship of the
Philadelphia man are taken, into con
sideration. He has met all kinds and
conditions of boxers from welter
weights up to men of Jeffries' stature
and has beaten most of them.
The match will undoubtedly come
as a big 'surprise to the members of
the sporting fraternity, for it was gen
erally thought that Delaney intended
sending- Kaufmann up against a lot of
easy ones before taking a chance with
the headliners. But if Al manages to
put the clever O'Brien away his fortune
is made, and if he is beaten then he
can take a chance with the dead ones.
O'Brien only arrived from the frozen
North yesterday afternoon, but as
soon as he got' in he began looking for
a match. Greg&ains had a talk with
Delaney and as the latter was willing
to pit Kaufmann against the Philadel
phia star the three got together last
night and after a long wrangle over
terms finally signed articles.
O'Brien, as u/iual,' was dressed in the
latest sort of togs, and wore diamonds
that would make the gems of the Shah
of Persia look like the rankiest kind
of phonies. Jack not only cleaned all
the fighters of the frozen North, but
incidentally picked up a lot of town
lot- and other real estate holdings that
netted him a big pouch of money.
It is likely that Jack Welch will ref
eree the contest. Both O'Brien and De
laney like the Potrero man. but they
inserted a" clause In the articles agree
ing to name the third man In the ring
one week before the fight takes place.
O'Brien Insisted on a clean break, but
Delaney assured him that It would not
go in this village, so the Philadelphian
consented to fight in the clinches and
break at the word of the referee.

Special Dispatch to Th* CalL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. Ift.â
The freshmen to-day won from the
crack eleven of Santa Clara College by
the score of 10 to 0 in the last practKii
game of the season. The yards in/
every instance were fought for from
the beginning- to the end of the contest.
The number of times the water carrier
and Dad Moulton were called on to the
field was proof enough of the fierceness
of the play.
Santa Clara put the leather Into play
and for the first five minutes the ball
changed hands constantly, neither side
being able to gain their yards many
times consecutively. In this period of
scrimmage the youngsters of the car
dinal managed to three times approach
within scoring distance, but were re
pulsed each time. The ball was finally
brought to the twenty-five-yard streak
and the surprise of the day was then
enacted.
Holman, who has hitherto never dis
played any ability to boot the ball,
gave the signal for a field groal and on
a clever drop kick placed the leather
squarely between the sticks. The half
closed with no further scoring.
Stanford opened the second spasm
with a rush and, with the combined
work of the back field and the use of
the tackle around tackle play, forced
the ball over for a touchdown. Cuth- 1 '
bertson was the man directly responsi
ble for the five points. Holman kicked
the goal. Score. 10-0. The play for the
remainder of the game was particu
larly fierce and men on both teams
were laid out promiscuously. The ball
at the time of the sounding of the final
whi3tle was in Stanford's possession at
the center of the gridiron. The line-up
was as follows: i

ing two and drawing one. Tha mission of. the
Britishers is to demonstrate to the American
people the advantages of association football as
a sport over the game played by the college
teams. '.rri',-- <\u25a0<
The members of the team have witnessed
several college football games and emphatically
declare the game Is not football at j all. but
_ test of brute strength with very little science.
Captain Mllnes voiced the sentiment of tha
members of his team yesterday when he said:
"I cannot r*e much merit In the football
game as played by the American colleges. It
Is unscientific and puts a premium on brut*
strength. Th* game we play la skillful, sci
entific and easy to understand."
The visitors will remain in this city ur<dÂ£
Friday afternoon when they will lea~e for "IvWf
Rtver, where they will play en Saturday. Th\?
will return to New York the next day and
bexin practice for the match with All-New
York on Saturday, October 21. Invitations
will be sent to several of the presidents and
members of the faculties of th* btg Eastern

NEW COMPANY
INCORPORATES
Gas and Electric Combine Is
Preparing to Take Over
the Two Older Concerns
HASTENING BIG DEAIi
Holding Corporation Expects
to Effect tlie Transfer
by First Day of January
The Pacific Gas and Electric Cota
pany filed articles of incorporation yes
terday as a preliminary step toward
formally absorbing the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company and the Cali
fornia Gas and Electric Company. ThÂ«
new company Is incorporated for $30,
000,000, with 100,000 shares of preferred
stock and 200,000 shares of common
stock, valued at $100 a share. The di
rectors are as follows: Eugene J. de
Salba Jr., John Martin, Frank G. Drum,
Garret W. McEnerney, John S. Dunn,
John A. Britton, Cyrus Pierce, Carl
Taylor, George K. Weeks, Frank D.
Stringham, Merrill O. Evans Jr., Alex
ander N. Kemp, George W. Lewis, C. R.
Parker and L. Foster Young.
i The absorption of the old companies
is progressing as rapidly as details will
permit. The California Gas and Elec
tric Company's \u25a0 stockholders have al
ready approved the deal and the stock
holders of the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company are moving in the
same direction. John Martin, who Is
one of the important factors in the
newly incorporated company, said yes
terday' that the incorporation papers
were filed mainly to enable the new
company to issue bonds on JEnuary 1
of the coming year. .Asked if his com
pany contemplated any Important
changes in the management of the old
companies, he said:
So far as I know there will be no changes
of any srreat consequence. \u25a0Of course, it is
to be exDected that the company will make
some chances amen* tho working forces of
the companies it Is about to take charge of,
but such a move will only be made after it
Is determined who of these men possess the
most ability. \u25a0 Under the agreement entered
into between the stockholders- of the old com
panies and the new one/the directorate of
the latter Is to be representative of all three.
The new company expects to complete
the organization of its directorate in a
f ew. days in order to hasten the work
attending the issuance of its bonds.
CABIN PASSEXGEII AVILL
XOT BE AL.LOAVED TO LAXD
Alexander F. Hintoa Who Arrived on
Coptic Found to Be Suffering;
From Tuberculosis.
Alexander P. Hlnton, a cabin passenger on
the liner Coptic from Yokohama has been or
dered deported. Hinton is an Englishman and
a consumptive. By profession he is a piano
tuner end was in business in Yokohama for
about twenty years. When the disease which
now bars his landing on . American soil de
veloped he consulted physicians who told him
that his only chance for life would be an ex
tended residence in Arizona or some place
where climatic conditions were similar.
Hlnton's appearance .attracted the attention
of the Federal quarantine officials at this- port
and when an investigation demonstrated that
he .was a victim of tuberculosis the steamship
company was notified not to allow the sick man
to land. Hinton will be returned to Yoko
hama on the Coptic.
California and Hawaii Co-operate.
Arrangements have been completed to bring
about a combination between the California
Promotion Committee and the Hawaii Promo
tion Committee. H. P. Wood, secretary of the
latter organization and formerly working with
tho California Promotion Committee, has car
ried out plans for co-operation in the develop
ment work of the Hawaiian Islands and the
Golden State. One plan of campaign is to con
vince tourists that in Hawaii they are near cer
tain wonders of California not to be missed, and
that in California they are near certain won
ders of Hawaii not to be missed. The moun
tains and volcanic cliffs or Hawaii will be used
to balance the Yosemite and the great Sequoia
or semi-tropical proves of California.
"Will Test Right of Supervisors.
The firm of Phillips & Van Orden is prepar
ing to test the right of the Board of Super
visors to pass upon bills incurred by the Elec
tion Commission for election printing and sup
plies. It has been the custom of the Finance
Committee to "hold up"' the bills because the
Commission had not invited- bids for the work.
The llrm / named has had to wait several
months \u25a0 for its. money and has secured legal
advice that under the Political Code the Super
visors have nothing to do with the bills. The.
case will be taken to the courts on a writ
of mandamus to compel the Auditor to audit
some demand drawn In favor of the firm
without the approval of the Supervisors having
first been secured.

WEDNESDAY OCTOBER n, 1905
THE MAYOR THREATENS.
MAYOR SCHMITZ, who is actively conducting Mr. Ruef's
campaign for the continuance of his graft and control of
the city, has adopted a threatening attitude. He has be
come virulent toward Mr. Brandenstein, the joint candidate for Dis
trict Attorney. Xo doubt Mr. Ruef is anxious to have a District
Attorney all his own. He fears that office. It is the office of the
public prosecutor. Mr. Ruef may be ripe on both sides for the
official attention of the District Attorney. With the city aH in, the
hands of decent officers the people may find out why Mayor Schmitz
has "stood by" Mr. â¢Ruef "through all," and what the "all" was and
whether Mr." Ruef got it all, or whether "all" was divided, and how
and with whom.
The Mayor is sure that the future will be black if Branden
stein is elected. He threatens that in that event there will "be
industrial war and bloodshed in the streets." He talks like .an
anarchistic revolutionist, and presents to the city the alternative of
his election or war and riot. This is going many steps farther than
even the grafters of Philadelphia. Will the people fear the threat
atid surrender to Ruef? Again the Mayor boasted that he is not
yet indicted. He declares that the last Grand Jury went through
every one of his acts with a fine tooth comb and found nothing
against him. Now this depends on what the Mayor thinks would
liave been against him.
The Grand Jury charged him with about three-score offenses,
indecent -in an official and hurtful to the city. A fine tooth comb
was not needed to find them. It could have been done with a horse
rake. But evidently the Mayor thinks that these acts were matters
of legitimate and proper administration. They were found by the
Grand Jv.ry, they are published in its report, and he does not deny
them. He' boasts that the report gives him a clean bill of health.
The Mayor must have strabismus in his morals. The charges which
he dees "not deny are regarded by the people as the most serious that
can be- made against a public officer. He abuses the Grand Jury,
and he has a reason.
It sent three of his most valuable supporters to the peniten
tiary for stuffing the ballot box. His administration 1 made every
effort to prevent their punishment. It stood in the way of the law
at every .turn and corner of the prosecution. The Mayor says in
his speeches, "Give me the District Attorney who will back me in
all that. I (Jo and I will give the city such reforms as they never
dreamed of." No doubt he will, and no doubt that from his moral
standpoint among the reforms will be immunity for his ballot box
siuffers. .
Every man in the city who has given any attention to the sub
ject believes thai the Mayor's administration is corrupt. Business
men believe it, and say so in their counting-rooms. Clergymen be
lieve it, and say so in their pulpits. Workingmen believe it, and
say so at their work bench. Even politicians, who are expert in the
signs, believe and say so, some of them, having guile of their own.
say it more in admiration than in rebuke. Mr. Ruef admitted it
when he said he would support the Mayor, who had "stood by"
him "through all." If Mr. Ruef is practicing his profession as a
private citizen in a lawful vocation, why is it so necessary for the
Mayor to stand by him? There are hundreds of better lawyers and
some worse than Mr. Ruef in San Francisco. Would it not at once
arouse suspicion if mny one of them announced himself a supporter
of the Mayor for the reason given by Mr. Ruef?
Now, with all this evidence, direct and indirect, against him
strengthened by his own demand that he be "given the District At
torney," it is quite impossible for the Mayor to sidetrack the re
form movement by threatening war and bloodshed in the streets
if he is not elected. We heard such threats in his first candidacy,
and as an ex-Mayor put it : "These threats led the people to fear
that the red flag of anarchy would fly from the City Hall. But in
stead it was the red flag of the auctioneer." Really the Mayor will
scare no one by his raw-head-and-bloody-bones fee-faw-fumming.
Schmitz will be beaten, and will have to stand by Ruef in pri
vate life, and there will be better industrial conditions than ever.
The Mayor will resume his occupation of drawing horsehair over
catgut, and the people, the united majority of the people, will take
up the task of cleaning up the muss he has made in the city gov
ernment. His defense is not valid. It is not good. He must make
n better showing for Mr. Ruef if he expect the people to keep that
thrifty boss in power for another term.
THE LEWIS AND CLARK FAIR.
WESTERN people are better patrons of an exposition than
Eastern. While the Lewis and Clark fair at Portland has not
paid a profit in money, and was not expected to, it has paid
in all the respects in which such exhibitions make a return. The
number of admissions exceeds the entire population of the Pacific
Coast and intermountain States. No other fair has made such a
record of admissions as that. The St. Louis exposition was lo
cated in close contact with a dense population, numbering tens of
millions. Had the attendance been in the same proportion as that
at. Portland a large financial benefit would have been returned.
The attendance at the Lewis and Clark exposition is a very
ifratiiying expression of local patriotism and neighborly good feel
mg of the best Western quality. These States, united in the same
destiny, have stood by their neighbor Oregon in the heartiest way,
and all are the better for it. California has done her duty in the
premises not only by a large attendance of her people, but by using
her imperial resources to enrich the show. The result has been
that the Eastern visitors have generally ticketed home this way and
we have had the greatest company of summer visitors ever seen in
the States. The hotels of San Francisco have been filled with this
travel ever since the exposition opened, and our guests have been
gratified by their visit here, supplementing the interesting-experi
ences at Portland.
It is the first time that the East has had an opportunity to see
so close together what we do and where we do it. At Portland
they saw ail that human enterprise and natural resources, combined
produce in California, and then coming this way they sawÂ«the great
and shining shop in which it was all wrought out. So the year has
been good for Oregon and the whole tributary region, and great for
California. Our neighbors in Oregon have done themselves proud
in the arrangement of the exposition and the hospitality which at
tended it.

"THE VOCABULARY CORPS."
y^-> ILSON WILLETS tells, in the Oc-
Utober World's Work, what it
means to earn one's living by
writing:
A "free lance" is an unsalarled
writer, whether he be journalistic hack
or another Victor Hugo. "Free lance"
means free to starve If one does not
feel like working; free to smoke an
execrable pipe In one's own workshop;
free to walk in the woods a day or a
week; free to rove the earth, the rover
paying his bills out of an Income de
rived from words. I know of a honey
moon on the Mediterranean, three ex
pensive, happy months, paid for out of
the Vocabulary Fund. Above all, "fr"ce
lance" means to go and to write where
every prospect pleases. There was a
"furnished house for the season" in a
Garden of Eden in St. John's Wood,
London, In spring, and one winter In
the Rivera there was a stone nest in
a paradise of palms. What workshops
can be paid for at a cent and a half
a word! Once I received an order for
a series of articles that would require
all June and July to write. The Mon
tauk, then, on the outer reach of Long
Inland, a hundred miles at sea, I took
my notes and my typewriter. There
was a good inn not far from the light
house, and there I had board and lodg

HOW GERMANY CAPTURES BUSINESS.
Those who are inclined to scoff at
the higher education of a people as a
fruitless and unnecessary expenditure
of means and energies should read a
report recently made to our State De
partment by Consul Osmun, from Stutt
gart, Germany, and learn the depth and
extent of their error. It is shown here
by Indisputable evidence that Germany
owes her pre-eminence to-day in many
lines of trade and industry chiefly to
the fact that she has established and
maintained for years a higher grade
of technical schools than any other
nation in the world, turning out regu
larly from them a body of trained ex
ports to manage her Important indus
tries, develop her resources, and im
prove her manufacturing and produc
tive-methods by their skill and scien
tific knowledge. Thus, it is said that
there are to-day in German factories
4500 thoroughly trained chemists, be
sides more than 5000 assistants, whose
brains are constantly at work upon the
problems of improving processes, les
sening the cost of production, and in
other ways promoting the industrial
welfare of the country.â Leslie's
Weekly.,
YfOULD MAM ANYBODY.
This is given by the Boston Herald
as the favorite story of a noted actress:
A colored "gemman," name unknown,
but called "Culpepper Pete,", who, being
enamored of some dusky maiden, and
not having the courage to "pop" face
to face, called up the house where she
worked and asked her over the tele
phone. When he got the proper party
on the line he asked: "Is dat Miss
Johnsing?" "Ya-as." "Well, Miss John
sing, I've got a most important ques
tion to ask you." "Ya-as." "Will you
marry me?" "Ya-as. Who is It, please?"

Sir Alfred Jones, the "Banana King,"
while I was a guest in' hlti home in
Liverpool. "I h rave 'a new steamer sail

AN INGENIOUS SCHEME.
Judge Benjamin B. Lindsey, who has
made a nntional reputation for himself
by his work at the Denver Juvenile
Court, tells In the American Magazine
for October the story of Eel Martin, a
typical bad boy, whom the Judge has
since succeeded in reforming. The fol
lowing Is one of the boy's exploits:
One of the boy's methods of beating
his way about the country was to board
a train and after It had started to creep
Into an empty berth in a sleeping car.
On one occasion Martin was awak
ened by the porter's startled* exclama
tion: "Good Lawd, the's a kid In
heah!" Then, as the boy phased It,
"I flew the coop while the coon guy
went to tell the conductor. I was
ditched at a to.wn they call Reno in
Nevada. Course I was dead broke. I
touched a guy for. a half and bought
me a cane and some chewing gum. I
wayced into a bank and right up to the
guy in de monkey-cage. I said I
wanted work, and he said he hadn't
none. I told him I'd clean up de back
yard, and" while he went to ask the
head guy about it I rammed de gum on
de end of my carre, shoved It frough
de cage and swiped a twenty that stuck
to the. gum. Then I took a hike mighty
sudden. I lay low and went out on the
express that .night."
EXPLANATION.
When at last a 3tudent. upon being
tarred and feathered by hazers, took
pneumonia and died, although nobody
had the hardihood to openly deny that
boys will be boys, there was some ad
verso comment.
Accordingly the president of the uni
versity issued a statement.
"This is one of those regrettable in
cidents," said he, 'for which nobody is
to blame. The faculty, in the exercise
of a strict control over all sports," ap
pointed a date for the hazing of this
student, and ordered a supply of tar
and feathers of the most approved
character, in ample time. But owing
to a railway accident this supply did
not arrive and the hazers. unable to
postpone the - event because of Â» all sub
sequent dates being filled, procured
tar and feathers as they could. .Some
of ' this! material, as it turns out, had*
not been properly sterilized, and as a
consequence the young man took cold."
This naturally ended the talk.
KAISER'S TIP
The Kaiser is popularly supposed to
be economical. .It is not generally
known that he pushes his principles
of economy to - absolute ! niggardliness,
says the London Tatler. It wll^; be re
membered \u25a0 that he visited Constanti
nople some time; back and . was g re
ceived with unexampled magnificence
and inundated with handsome presents.
During his stay In the Ottoman capital
the Emperor's aide jj de % camp was in
structed by his' imperial master to dis
tribute such gifts as were usual among
the servants attached to his person.
He offered n dollar to- the head coach
man^' The latter without a moment's
hesitation returned it.*,:; VThanks," he
said, "I am) not: thirsty.", >.
RIDICULE
i C i |â v O little things get on your
I J nerves, Turner? 1 inquired
iâ J Cummings thoughtfully as
he sipped his drink.
" 'Sure they do,' answered Turner.
'Ed Burr came in last night and
knocked a whole row of them glasses
ofT'n the shelf with his billiard cue. I
knowed he was only playin', but it
riled me.' â¢*
"'I don't mean things like that
exactly. I mean people's peculiarities."
""Do they! Say, you know that
spavined Englishman that acts as if he
was goiri* to kiss you every time he
tells you It's a beautiful day? 1 have
to give my gun to the barber when -I
see his mug coming through the door,
so I won't shoot him.'
".'Now, my wife has a habit which
irritates me,' continued Cummings, ar
riving finally at the point toward which
he had been working. 'She'll sit at the
table and polish a chicken bone till it
looks as if somebody had gone over it
with a piece of sandpaper. It makes
me so mad I can't eat. Good wife, good
mother, line Housekeeper, but the way
she worries a bone would make a man
commit suicide. I've reasoned with her
and explained how it affected me, but
she only gives me the loud hal! ha! and
tells me to take my plate out in the
woodshed If I don't like the way she
; cats. It's a little thing, Turner, and it
doesn't sound much when you tell it,
but sooner or later I believe It's going
to break up my home.'
" 'Know just how you feel about it
: exactly," said Turner sympathetically.
\u25a0Seen a man butter his bread with his
i thumb nail onet â "fected me the same
! way. ' Did you ever try ridicule*'"
i "'Ridicule?' repeated Cummings
: doubtfully.
""'Most effective weapon." The trite
ness of Turner's statements never in
: the least affected the Impressiveness
! with which he delivered them. 'Growl
like a dJg,' urged Turner.
" 'Now?' Cummings' sunken eyes
widened.
" 'When she begins to gnaw.'
" 'By gum! â I never thought of that â
I'll do it! Turner, how can I thank
; you?' His hand went out impulsively.
; ""S all right, old man,\" replied the
barkeep kindly. â From Caroline Lock

"Tired?" queried Ignorance, winking
slyly at Poverty, for these three, as is

COME over the gulf that is set. Nor

The Ditlful chasm of death:
From mystical lands where you
bide, my queen.
Reach out to our Country of Breath,
For I yearn for you still as I Journey
alone,
As the blossom doth yearn for Ita dew;
Then come to my side from the shadows,
my own,
For my heart Is aweary for ypu.

Sometimes in the gloaming I linger, Nor

And dream of the day that fs dead,
When we were so happy together, my

Ere out to the shadows you fled;
And I feel the soft kisses you.preS3 on
my face,
As you did In the days that are flown,
And my soul, turning back to our yester

Forgets that It wanders alone.
Are you happy out there in the shadows,
Norine?
Does our God in his kindliness give
Some art of forgetting, nor caring, my
queen,
.That I must In llneliness live?
Time was when you had not been cheery,
my pet.
To know that alone I must stray.
With ne'er your caresses to bless me â
and yet/
That now you are happy I pray.
Perhaps in the land where you journey.
Norine,
You know that the trials we bear
Are petty and vain, and your soul is
serene,
As you hold me c'en yet in your care;
Yet sometimes I think that heaven's own
bliss
Must somewhat of bitterness know,
As your longing soul starts at the dream
of a kiss '.."':
In our Land of the Long, Long Ago.
Come over the gulf that is set, Norine,
The pitiful chasm of death.
For my soul is aweary with longing, my
queen.
For the warmth of your languorous
breath,
As softly, full softly, It kisses my cheek;
In my heart is a sigh of regret
For the days unforgotten whose rapture
I seekâ
Come back from the shadows, my pet.

"I dreamed the other night." said Miss
Oleglrl to her very dearest friend, "that
one of these genii that you read about in
the Arabian Nights Entertainment and
books of that sort came to me as I was
sitting in my boudoir."
"Wasn't that queer?" the dearest friend
gurgled.
"Yes, and he was the handsomest crea
ture I ever saw; exactly like a large man,
with a commanding presence and dark,
rolling orbs, and a look indicative of a
mysteriousâ oh, he was perfectly love

vowed that he had been attracted by my
charms and was deeply in love with me,
"Wasn't that queer!"
"Well, I don't know. You needn't seem
so surprised by it, .anyway. And he said
he did hope that I wonld marry him and
be his own true tootsy-wootsy. 'But,'
he said, 'there is one thing of which the
laws under which I exist compel me to
inform you: I regret deeply to say that
1 have no soul."
"Did you reject him?"
"No, I did not. Afier consulting my
own heart I felt pretty well satisfied, and
so I said to him:
" 'Well, that doesn't make any partic
ular difference. You look like a man
and, as for soul, I guess you have about
as much as some of the men -whom
friends of mine have married.' "
"You showed your usual sound judg
ment even in your dream."
"Do you think so? Weil, anyway, it
is too bad that there are no such things
as genii, isn't. it?"
The dearest friend said it was.

SUSIE'S LITTLE WAYS.
Vtss Susie had a little song
The thought was quite the thine:.
And so she sung it to her Claude:
"I'm saddest when I sing."
I really hate to mentionâ
And yet, you know, it's true â
Whene'er she sang that little ' song
That Claude seemed saddest, too.
Miss Susie did some painting
That was unique and quaint.
And once she said to Claude: "How do
You like the things I paint?"
Now Claudie's lips had sometimes strayed
And haply been misplaced.
And -so he smacked them some and said.
"I really like the taste."
Miss Susie loved the breakers,
And said that joy she knew
While foortlnjr In the water,
And Claudle aald so, too.
"I sometimes wish," she murrmured,
"That higher they would go."
Claude looked another way and said,
. "I wouldn't dare wish so!"

Ceremony Takes Place in the
Presence of Large Party
of Railroad Traffic Men
Standing on the brink of the precipi
tous wall of the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado two well-known young San
Franciscans were yesterday united in
marriage in the presence of a hundred
of their friends, who had little expected
that their trip to the great scenic spot
would be attended by a wedding. The
contracting parties were ML^s Anna
Alberger, daughter of W. R. Alberger,
foreign freight agent of the Santa Fe
Company, and Ray Dunann. son of
Charles Dunann, general passenger
Egent of the Paciflc Coast Steamship
Company.
Miss Alberger, who is an attractWe
young woman, and Dunann were
among the party of railroad traffic men
who left here Saturday night In a spe
cial train for the Grand Canyon. While
It was known that Cupid was flitting
about, no one atfoard the special train
suspected that matrimony was fore
moÃt in the minds of the couple when
they embarked upon the sight-seeing
trip.
On approaching the canyon yesterday
young Dunanii formally announced to
his traveling companions that he and
Miss Alberger had decided to get mar
ried that very day. Hurried prepara
tions for the wedding were made, a
minister from Mexico was engaged to
perform the service and under a clear
sky. with the canyon, in all ltj<Â» grand
eur, stretching out before them, the
bridal couple and their friends joined
in the ceremony that terminated in a
luncheon at the new hotel.
The first Intimation of the marriage
that was received in this city came in
a dispatch yesterday to the effect that
the wedding had taken place. Mr. and
Mrs. Dunann will return here with the
special train of traffic men on Thurs
day.
HUSBAND SAYS WIFE
ELOPED WITH ACTOR
Mrs. I^e, Wife of Colored
Horseman, Flees in the
Mght.
Mrs. Edward Lee, wife of a colored
race horse owner and driver, who lives
at 1142 Taylor street, deserted her hus
band Monday evening and took -with
her J2OO in cash and a mortgage valued
at $150. Lee believes his wife has
left the city with Harry A. Brown,
who posed as an Indian and took the
part of the cartoonist in Brown and
Brown's famous act at the Orpheum
three weeks ago.
Lee. who is training his own horses
on the Oakland track, returned from
his work late Monday night and found
his wife had not yet returned from the
Novelty Theater, where she had gone
with two women friends. He walked to
the corner, and, after nearly an hour's
chat with a friend, returned to the
house and was told that his wife had
returned, but had made a very hasty
exit after having gone to her room.
Lee at once went to his room,, where
he found his 5200 gone. He then
started in search of the woman and
traced her to the Novelty Theater. He
there learned that his wife, accom
panied by two other women, had sent
a' message to Brown, who was in the
audience, and she and Brown left the
theater together.
Lee stated last night that his wife
\u25a0was a very pretty mulatto girl. Just
past her nineteenth year, and had been
taken for a white girl on more than
one occasion. This is the first trouble
they have ever had and Lee says now
that If he could only get his money
back he would not care if she never
came back.
Harry A. Brotra and his brother are
traveling on the Orpheum circuit as
Carlisle Indians and have a very clever
little act. In which Harry draws car
toons while his brother sings. They
appeared at the Orpheum three weeks
tgo and had Just returned from Los
Angeles Monday \u25a0morning 1 . Both men
left for Denver yesterday and It Is sup

them.

Mrs. Phoebe Hearst's generosity to th<*
University of California in the interest of
science was once more made evident at
the meeting of the Regents of the Uni
versity held yesterday at the Hopkins'
Art Institute.
With reference to Mrs. Hearst's mu
nificence President Benjamin Ida Wheeler
said:
Mrs. Hearst offers to -give to thÂ« Regents

lection of archaeological and anthropological
materials which Bhe has been ooll*ctlng dur
ing the past seven years and which are now
brought together in the westernmost building

now en route from .Europe. This collection
has oost Mrs. Hearst eomewhat over $400,000.
She will also rive to the university for the
maintenance of the department or anthro
pology and the completion of ths work of
collecting" and cataloguing the various ex
hibits of the museum the sum of $60,000,
payable in such installments as the Regents
may w'sh. not exceeding $20,000 in any one
year, the whole sum to be expended under
the direction of the Board of Regents. ThÂ«
above arrangement Is to begin as of July 1.
1905.
On the motion of Regent Relnsteln
Mrs. Hearst's offer was accepted with ex
pressions of appreciation.
> SEEKS TO AID SCIEXCE.
President Wheeler announced that Dr.
Morris Herzsteln had donated a large
body of land at Monterey near Pacific
Grove and a laboratory where pure sea
water could be obtained for the pursuit
of scientific work in connection with the
researches of Professor Jacques Loeb.
There had already been built a tem
porary structure In line with the Ru
dolph Spreckels laboratory at tho Uni
versity and Dr. Herzstein had equipped
it with apparatus which was considered
the finest of its kind in this country ex
cepting that at Wood's Hole, Buzzard's
Bay.
Ths gift bears no stipulations. A vote
of thanks to Dr. Herzstein accompanied
the formal acceptance.
Regent Charles S. Wheeler moved "that
fhe architect be instructed to proceed with
the plans for the University of California
library along the lines at present under
consideration, atid to arrange for the
complete construction of the shell of the
structure and so much of the interior aa
will provide for the immediate needs of
the University at a total cost not to
exceed $700,000."
The motion was carried unanimously.
The matter of the consideration of the
purchase of the Bancroft Library for
$150,000 was briefly alluded to when Pres
ident Wheeler announced that Reuben
Gold Thwaites of the University of Wis

BAIRD'S STRICT
HOISTY SHOWN
Dental Investigation Gives
Approval to the Conduct
of President of Board
BOOKS ARE STRAIGHT
Finds Funds of Body Were
Kept by Him in Thorough
and Business-Like Manner
The result of' the recent investigation
of the irregularities alleged to have
existed in tho affairs of the State
Board of Dental Examiners seems to
prove that neither Dr. F. Q. Baird,
president of the board, nor any of his
fellow-members were guilty of dishon
est official conduct, but that a better
state of harmony should have been pre
served among . them.
No charges of t any nature were
brought against Dr. Baird, although
before the investigation began . many
incriminating reportS^about him were
circulated and "published. The evidano*
showed that his every action on tho
board had been honest and according to
law. He waa proved to have always
handled the money of the- board In a
thorough and business-like manner,
and his books were found to be cor
rect. That he was extremely careful
in granting of temporary licenses is
evidenced by the fact that during his
four ' years of membership he granted
only twenty-nine such certificates. He
wa<s unusually energetic in prosecuting
illegal practitioners during his term
In office.
Dr.' Baird has held many, important
offices .in the .different dental organiza
tions of the State. Many of his frienoji
feel that he has been wronged by the
unfounded reports which have been cir
culated about him and which the In
vestigation proved to be false.
WOODWOUTH'S WIFE
SUES FOE DIVORCE
She Charges Ex-United States
District Attorney With
Desertion.
Ex-United States District Attorney
Marshall B. Woodworth was made the
defendant in an action for divorce in
stituted yesterday by Mrs. Charlotte A.
Woodworth. Desertion is charged by
Mrs. Woodworth.
In her complaint she recites that she
married Woodworth on March 26, 1902,
and that he deserted her on October 6,
1904. In addition to a decree of di
vorce, Mrs. Woodworth asks for the
custody of their son, Marshall B. Wood
worth Jr., who is now 2 years and 7
months of age, and for permanent ali
mony. She asserts that she has no sep
arate estate out of which she can main
tain herself, and in consequence asks
that the court make an order providing
for the permanent support of herself and
little son. Mrs. Woodworth is repre
sented by Attorney A. Heynemann,
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to Anna from George Dillon, for
desertion; Xeil from Isabelle Campbell,
for desertion; >*ora C. from Joseph E.
Whltmore, for desertion, and Katie A.
from William O. Gillette, for cruelty.'
The petition of Etta A. Stone â¢ for dl-.
vorce from William J. Stone was denied
by Judge Hebbard, who held that the
troubles of the litigants were due to
the interference of their sisters and
said he was satisfied that if this could
be eliminated all would be. well.
Suits for divorce were filed by Luella
M. against Merl E. Palmer, for neglect;
Lette A. against Benjamin F. Lewis,
for desertion;. Annie L. against Albert
L. Saunders, for neglect; Anker M.
against Grace Nielsen, for cruelty;
Wolf against Louise Routstein, for de
sertion; Katherlne against John H.

BURBAMC EXPRESSES THANKS
FOR BANQUET IN HIS HONOR
State Board of Trade Receives Com
munication and Also Considers
Matters of Business.
Luther Burbank addressed a letter of thanks
to the California State Board of Trade, which
was read at a meeting- of the board yesterday,
In which thanks were expressed for the honor
conferred by the recent State banquet, where
his services to the State were acknowledged
by distinguished men. Tha board evidently
was of the opinion that the affair was a suc
cess, for various compliments were lndividua'ly
paid to Manager Arthur R. Brlggs, who had
the arrangements In charge. A formal resolu
tion was adopted In which Manager Brlggs
was thanked. It was voted to instruct the
manager of the board to take steps In co
operation with the Southern Paciflc Company
to have the board's exhibit at the Portland
KxpoÃltlon Installed on the Oakland mole when
It Is returned from the north.
A letter from the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association asking- the board to pay
$40 for expenses attending the opening of the
new Postofflce was read. Inasmuch as there
is In existence a fund ot something more
than $180 remaining alter the Taft banquet
of a sum Jointly collected from all the. com
mercial organizations of the city It appeared
to several of the members that the liability
If any. should run against the share the board
has In that money, although It was expressly
stated that the board was not aware that It
Incurred any liability for the Postofflce cele
bration when It appointed a member of the
committee on celebration. The entire matter
originated with the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association. The sum of $40 was
not forwarded. The manager. was Instructed to
communicate further on - the subject with the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association.
Manager Brlggs was requested to attend a
meeting of the Sacramento Valley Development
Association, at which the subject of the Irri
gation of the Bacramento Valley and re
clamation of valley lands will bo discussed.
A report on this subject will be made at the
next meeting of the board and will probably
be taken up as & special order.

MOSCOW STRIKE
FAST SPREADING
Employes of a Majority of
the Factories Join the
Idle Printers and Bakers
CROWDS ARE DISPERSED
Workmen Keep the Police
Busy, bnt the Day Passes
Without Serious Trouble
MOSCOW, Oct. 10. â The majority of
the factories here, especially in the
great industrial Quarter of Zamosk
voretoh, which is across the river from
tho rest of the city, joined In the strike
of printer^ and baken to-day. ThÂ«
movement threatens to become general,
though it ia opposed by a strong minor
ity of the workmen. â¢
Tho streets are comparatively tran
quil. Several times to-day processions
of striking, workmen, in which rad
flags were carried, paraded the Indus
trial. Quarter^ and the police were
forced to disperse the crowds, but aside
from the affray to-day at the Liebrecht
furniture factory, no bloodshed has
been reported and the troops were not
forced to resort to arms. Crowds of
roughs started to break tha windows
la \u25a0 tin Tverskoi boulevard, the- center
of tho previous disorders, which haÂ»
been reopened to traffic, but thÂ«)r fled
on the approach of the police.
The workmen generally, are demand
ing an eight-hour day and a large in
crease in wages. Among their unique
demands Is one for the abolishment of
religious lectures by priests in the fao
tories and the substitution of lectures
on economic and political subjects.
No newspapers will appear to-mor
row.
The employes of the .electric street
railways, by a secret ballot, voted to
continue the strike, and as a conse
quence no cars are running 1 .
In most .of the. factories there are
two parties, one for and one against
the strike, and there are constant en
counters between them.

JOHN S. PARTRIDGE DRAWS
ADMISSIONS FROM ECKART
Cost of Replacing Pnmpti Would Be IS
Per Cent Higher Than AVlien
Originally Constructed.
William R. Eckart, expert mechanical en
gineer for the Spring Valley Water Company,
was cross-examined yesterday afternoon In
United States Commissioner Heacock's court
by Assistant City Attorney John S. Partridge.
The witness testified that it would cost $75,500
at the present time to replace the Belmont
pumps, while the actual cost wajj $03,0-65.
The three engines and pumps which were
added in 1002 cost $54,183, whlla it would
cost to replace them $65,000. The witness
added that the six boilers cost $21,062. The
estimate given by former witnesses was
$33,320.
Mr. Partridge drew from the witness the
Important admission that the present cost of
the pumps averages 18 . per cent higher than
the original cost on account of the fact that
the cost of wages and material Is greater now
than It was when the pumps were put In.
The cross-examination will be resumed at
10 o'clock on Thursday morning.

SALOONS BOYCOTT
STKIKE-BREAKEKST
Entire Town Eises Against
Non-Union Railway Men
Near Chicago.
CHICAGO, Oct. 10. â A weary, hungry
grans ot non-union switchmen spent
last night in boxcars on a siding: ot tha
Grand Trunk freight yards ai Elsdoa.
They did not take the lodgings from
choice, but because the residents of
Elsdon, out of sympathy for the strik
ers, had driven every non-union raa.n
from shelter in the suburb. Evtry
hotel, lodging quarters, boarding-houso
and private residence in Elsdon joined
in the boycott. The stores were locked
and the barber shops closed. Even thÂ«
saloons refused admittance to the un
welcome strangers. The two village
marshals, with gruff orders to "Jlova
on!" proceeded to hustle the non
unionists out of town..
Confronted with the alternative of
having to walk several miles or 3peml
the night in the open, the men decided
to consult Yardmaster Conroy of the
Grand Trunk. He found the empty
boxcars on the siding.' Blankets were
procured and the forty-eight non-union
men went aupperless to bed. The rail
road officials said that arrangements
would bo made to house the men in
barracks. -

Xht York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. lv. â There was some per
ceptible relaxation In the money market to
day and a resulting relief from the pressure
cf liquidation In the stock market which was
In evidence yesterday. At the same time the
I one or two incidents calculated to inspire the
I fpeculstlve spirit occurred. The result was a
I movement toward recovery in prices. There
I Â«rsÂ« nothing like a revival of speculative ac
j tivlty. however, as shown by -the practical
] cutting' In half of the volume of transactions
compared with yesterday. Except In a few
closely held stock? the price movement was
narrow ana sluetish. The long prevalent ru
mors of a rae!on cutting for the Great North
ern stockholders developed In the decision to
issue $25.rK)0,0C0 of new stock, present stock
holders to be allowed to subscribe at par at
the extent of 20 per cent of their holdings.
Probably a thousand rumors have circulated
as to the outccmlng benefit to the stockholders
of this company, but none of them proved to
h.ive been entirely accurate. The announce
ment ceemed unexpected at Just this time,
aiid the price of the stock was rushed up over
four points during the first hour. In thÂ« curb
market a quotation was established for the
subscription rights by sales at 35H to 37.
.The stock was also helped by the statement of
gross earnings reported for September, which
reached $4,D55,ti51. an Increase over the pre
vious year of $1,057.&56. The declaration of
the initial dividend on the common stock of
the United States Cast Iron Pipe Company
was an influence in a number of low-priced
industrial stocks. The call money rate yielded
rather decisively below 0 per cent to-day for
the first time since last week's flurry. At the
same Urns sentiment over the money outlook
was improved In London. This latter develop
ment reemed to be due largely to the report i
that the Hai.k of France had relinquished .
f0.000.u00 in gold to be shipped to Egypt, re- ,
lievlng by that much a requirement in the
London market. The continental exchange
also moved In favor of London, although dis
counts hardened both at Paris and Berlin and
rt-malned stationary in London. The price
of gold, however, was marked up in London.
The foreign exchange market here was firm
again In responce to the easier tone of the
money mark*;, but there was a general belief
that the relaxation In money Is due 4argely
to yesterday's liquidation of speculative ac
counts In BtockE. Re-deposlts on New* York
tax payments are a factor and liquidation in
cotton, also Is believed to have afforded relief
to the money market. The quiet tone of
money is felt to be dependent at present on I
the quietude of epeculatlon. The belief had
an eftect In restraining any acttTlty In the
stock market. The Government reports con
firmed the existing confidence tn the favorable
outcome cf the crops and helped the strong
undertone of stocks. Some attention was at
tracted by reports of the extent to which the
congestion of freight threatens to embarrass
grain and flour exporters here owing to their
large contracts for delivery on the other side
with engagement of freight room on eteam
ships Â«nd purchases In the West already made.
The day's extreme rise in stocks was not all
held Â»:ntil the closing o\rtng to the profit
taking movement In the last hour and the
closing tone was Irregular. Bonds were steady.
Total sales (par value). $2,235,000. United
States bonds were nil unchanged on call.

The market Is quiet at present, not btcause
of any diminution in the demand, but because
packers are so busy filling and shipping their
previous orders that they are unable to attend
to any new business. The tone of the market

short time a.go and the subsequent dis
covery that he had "robbed his trust
ing employer surprised the business
world, came to light yesterday. It is
now eaid that Mr. Caffrey has been ap
prised of a further shortage of $11,000
charged against the man who violated
the trust placed In him. The discovery
of this further defalcation ha{3 been
made during the last few days, and
\u25a0was unexpected, even after the fact of
the stealing of $8500 had been estab
lished.
It is said that Meier has sent tele
grams to a friend in this city during
the,, last few days under the came of
"Moeller," giving instructions in cer
tain matters to be attended to before
he makes his way to the colony of
criminal from America in Honduras.
MAY GO FROM GALVESTOJT.
The police of this city have sent
telegrams giving the defaulter's de
scription and asking that he be ar
rested.
Owing to the yellow-fever quaran
tine against New Orleans, the steamers
that formerly ran from there to Hon
duras are now leaving from Galveston.
It is said to be Meier's intention, if he
has not already done this, to go to
Galveston and from there take pas
sage to Honduras. Telegrams have
been sent to the Texan seaport and aljso
to the Pinkerton detectives in Hon
duras. It is hoped that if Meier has
already left Galveston he may be taken
just as he enters Honduras, in that
small strip of country where the fugi
tives are still legitimate prey for the
offieem of the law.
It has been learned that Meier has
two confederates In this city who are
attending to his affairs, and to one of
these, it is alleged, have been sent the
telegrams signed "Moeller." The po
lice here believe that these two men
received some of the gold stolen by
Meser and that they have been in con
stant communication with him since
his flight and have aided in his move
ments. They may be arrested at any
time. <
MADE FIXAL CLEA3T-UP.
It is believed that the $11,000 short
age consists of stealings made just be
fore Meier fied. between the last two
collection days preceding his departure,
and most likely upon receipt of the
telegram from John Caffrey that he
vas soon to return from Europe, where
he had been for some time. It is also
believed that Meier had a large part
of this money \u25a0when he fled and that
It is now furnishing him the means of
traveling. The police believe that he
was bled of some of it by the two men
alluded to, as they had probably known
of his stealings for some time and
threatened exposure unless he supplied
them with funds.
It has been learned also that most
of the money derived from Meier's early
stealings was lost on the race track,
though he, like Gus Wldber, the de
faulting City Treasurer, did not him
self go tjear any track. He placed his
bets through agents. To Charles C.
Mclvor of this city, formerly a foot
racer and who gained notoriety through
his matrimonial experiences, he gave
the money to be placed, and Joseph W.
Van Praag, also known In San Fran
cisco, laid the bets at an Eastern track.
Meier never made any winnings and
his condition at the time Manager Caf
frey telegraphed he was about to re
turn was a desperate one. Then came
the final clean-up and the flight.
Van Praag is now In this city, having
arrived here recently. Mclvor lived
with Meier up to the time of his flight
In a flat on H/de street, rented and
furnished by the defaulter, who also
paid the expenses of maintaining the
establishment.

ESTABLISHED IX SAY FRANCISCO ISSO.
TWO FAMILIES FIGHT
BATTLE IN HALL.
Men, Women and Children Join in Mix-
Jjp Outside Judge Cabaniss] Court.
Judge T^readwell Is Caught Hn Wangle of
Combatants and Is Pummeled.
They call it the Battle of Judge
Trcadwell, but Its historic name is the
Battle of the Tribes. It was fought
on the second floor of the Hall of Jus
tice. The field of battle is still red and
reeking with gore. Judge Treadwell is
stll! applying soothing lotions to his
solar, plexus and various other parts
of his anatomy. Captain Charles Hem
pie of the scow schooner Verbena is
still trying to mold his nose back into
shape and Mrs. Hemple is trying to
ctfunt the auburn tresses that are miss
ing from her head. Even the tribe of
Grayv who came out victorious, still
bear scars of the fray.
The fabulous Donnybrook Fair was
an icecream social compared to the
Battle of Judge Treadwell while it
lasted. Men. women and children joined
in the fracas. Three bailiffs and two
policemen hovered on the edge of the
fray tugging at whomsoever they could
seize. Grays and Hemples struck right
and left at every face that seemed un
familiar.
Captain Hemple's nose bore the brunt
of the first charge of the Grays. In a
minute it looked as if a slxteen-inch
shell had struck it. Gore from the
shattered proboscis besprinkled the
other contestants, glvlng-the affray the
aspect of a real war.
It was when he saw through the
smoke of battle a kick land upon Mrs.
Hemple's person that the fighting blood
of Judge Treadwell was roused.
"Charge, Con Donahue, charge!"
shouted Treadwell. "OnT" Mike Walsh,
on to the rescue!"
With these words the mighty Tread
well charged Into the thickest of the
fray. And It was certainly the thick
est thing In the fray line that has been
pulled off for some time.
"Oof!" grunted the Judge a minute
later. A punch in the solar plexus tied
him into double bow knots. Another
wallop straightened him out again.
The gallant charge was repulsed. Baf
fled and wounded, Treadwell began to
retire in good order. A terrific punch
caught him on the back of the neck,
and his retreat became a panic.
i The battle began shortly before noon.
Mrs. Gray was just released on a
charge of disturbing the peace pre
ferred against her by Mrs. Hemple.
The Gray army marched out and took
up a strong position near Judge Con
lan's Courtroom. The Hemples deployed
and advanced In open order. As the
Hemples came up Mrs. Hemple fired a
remark at Mrs. Gray. Mrs. Gray rushed
forward and seized Mrs. Hemple by her
wealth of auburn locks. That was the
signal for a general engagement.
While the wives were rolling about
the floor in a duel to death or baldness
the husbands engaged. The first and
the largest quantity of blood was
drawn fcom Hemple's nose. He was a
veritable Niagara of gore as the com
bat waged. The Gray children and the
Hemple children did some fierce
guerrilla fighting while ; their parents
were exchanging blow for blow.
Allied forces, composed of bailiffs
and policemen, finally surrounded the
combatants. With the help of crow
bars they segregated the mixture of
Grays and Hemples.
The battle-stained veterans were
haled before ' Judge Cabaniss.iwho was
made a sort of Hague- tribunal.
First he gave them I a lecture, then
he imposed some punishments that
cooled their fighting ardor. Hemple
and Gray were each held on a charge
of disturbing the peace. Mrs. Gray was
fined $10 for contempt of court. Mrs.
Hemple was given a talking.to. -
The Hemples and the Grays live out
on Bernal Heights, where the goats run
wild and where the police appear only
once in, a while. There -has been a
feud on ' between the tribes for many
months. \u25a0
On September 29 Mrs. Gray accused
Mrs. Hemple of firing four. shots at her
and charged her with assault with a
deadly weapon. Mrs. Hemple was ac
quitted. Yesterday Mrs. Gray was
charged before Judge Cabaniss with
THE 'SAN FRANCISCO CALL, V/EDNESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1905.
disturbing the peace. This charge was
brought by Mrs. Hemple. Judge Ca
baniss released her on her own recog
nizance.
The trouble between the two families
started when one of. the Grays', goats
butted a Hemple goat. â¢ One the same
evening the Hemple bulldog chewed an
ear from the Grays' fox-terrier. The
Gray chickens began to fight wjth the
Hemple fowls and soon the feud ex
tended to.the children of both families.
Then, of course, the parents took a
hand and the climax resulted in the
battle of Judge Treadwell.
In the open court yesterday Judge
Mogan advocated the whipping post for
husbands who beat and ill-ufle their
wives. The case of Arthur A. Powell,
charged with threats against life by
his wife, a meek and sickly little wom
an, roused his Honor's indignation
and he gave Powell a grilling that
made him crinsre.
"It Is unfortunate that there is no
adequate punishment for cowardly
brutes like you," thundered Judge Mo
gan. "We should have whipping posts
for such as you. â¢It doefl no good to
send men of your stamp to jail. What
you should get is twenty lashes twice
a week. I would take a pleasure in
prescribing that for you If I could. 1
will draft a bill myself to go before
the next Legislature for the establish
ment of whipping postfl."
Mrs. Powell declares that her hus
band spent the, last cent, they had In
the bank to buy a pistol to frighten
her with. She says that he has ill
used and starved herself - and her
twelve-year-old daughter. V
In order to make sure that Powell
would be held Judge Mogan fixed his
bail at 55000. His Honor declared that
Powell would get the limit sentence.

Mouser . alleges â¢'that.- on the next

Curry assailed him with a loaded stick

Private Lawrence Williams, Troop D,

With an array revolver he plunged into
the revelry of a dance hall on the Ave

He did some fine shooting until Police
man Skaln arrived. Williams made a
record of two imitation tortoise shell
combs, three- incandescent lights and a
mirror. Judge Mogan will . quench the
warrior's ardor on Friday, the 13th.
Whether or not Private Williams is su

lucky for him.

peared. Whether they vanished into the
air or were carried away and hidden by
trained fleas which the .crafty Ah Sing
carried about with him for the purpose
cannot be determined.
Some lottery lists were found on the
Asiatic. A Chinese Interpreter declared
that they were Japanese and the Jap in
terpreter insisted - that the writing- was
Chinese. Judge Mogan continued the
case until a half-breed interpreter can
be secured. -

STORY SMACKS

Henriette Reush Places Man
She Accuses of Betraying
Her in Serious Position
DETAILS -CONVERSATION
Declares That Her Testimony
Given at First Trial of
the Case Was the Truth
Henrietta Reush, the young girl, who is
the complaining witness against Bennett
Millar on a. charge of criminal assault,
for the third time changed her testimony
at the trial before a Jury In Judge
Cook's court yesterday, declaring that
the story she told at the first trial impli
cating the ' defendant was true.
She asserted she was induced by Miss
Jennie Johnston, a laundress, to meet the
defendant in* Miss Johnson's room, at; 415
Mason street, after the first trial, when
the story she told on Tuesday of last
week at the second trial of the case was
concocted. That story was to the effect
that the defendant was innocent and that
a boy named Leopold, who used to work
for her father at 321^ Ellis street, was
her betrayer. She asserted at that, time
that_ her mother had told her in a dream
to speak the truth and that no one had
influenced her to change her testimony.
She was ordered Into the custody of the
Sheriff pending the laying of an informa
tion charging her with perjury or plac
ing the matter before the Grand Jury.
When the case was called yesterday the
girl took the witness stand and testified
that the defendant, who has a tailor shop
in the same building as her father's
laundry, was her betrayer. She then re
lated the following circumstances that
led her to tell a different story last week:
I had a conversation with Miss Jennie John
ston on Monday, September 25. She started it
by asking me to come to her room to meet
Millar. She asked me. Hadn't I any pity lor
Millar's wife and three children, and couldn't
I forgive him? She asked me to make a date
to meet Millar. I could tell my father that I
waa going to the theater with her. I agreed to
meet Millar at Mlbs Johnston's room the fol
lowing evening. I met Millar there, and he
said to me: '.'Haven't you any pity for me?
look at my poor wife, worrying herself to
death night and day about my being in this
position "
I told him I did not want to get myself Into
any trouble, and he said: "I will tell you
what to say. 'Just cay a boy did It, and they
can't force you to give hlo name. They will
try to scare you by threatening to send you to
Jail, but they won't do It." I said that I
would have pity upon him, but didn't want to
get Into trouble, and he said It would be all
right and he would do anything In the world
fop mi. "I don't have any money for my
self." he said, "but you go with Mr. Black,
my attorney, to Mr. Brilliant and say that his
son was In trouble for betraying you, and If
Brilliant would give you $6000 the boy would
get out of " the trouble." ;He said that Mr.
Black would get $2500 and I would get the
other $2500. â¢ I saw the defendant again on
Monday, October 2. the day prior to making
my statement In court.
She then related the facts of her be
trayal by the defendant and the Judge
said he would postpone her cross-exam
ination till Friday to give Attorney Black
an opportunity of doing so, as he was
unable to be present yesterday.
Mrs. Anna Colas, Piedmont, was called
and testified that the girl had told her on
September 29 of the conversation she had
with Millar in Miss Johnston's room and
that Millar was to give her $2500 for get
ting him out of the trouble for the sake
of his children. She had known the girl
since she was born, in January, 1891.
A. 'Reush, the girl's father, testified as
to her age and Dr. Mark Neuman as to
her condition in June last. \
Miss Johnston was placed under arrest
by Detective Wren and she was brought
from the City Prison to testify that she
Vas in "the employment of the girl's
father at the time of the alleged as
sault. She will be detained pending the
developments on Friday.
Dr. Ryfkogel and Dr. Benepe have

MOTHER APPEALS FOR
AID OF LITTLE ONES
Mrs. Mary E. Dye Accuses
Divorced Husband of
Heartlessiiess.
With two little children clinging to
her gown, Mrs. Mary R. Dye of 3265
Twenty-first street- entered Judge Gra
ham's court yesterday to plead her own
petition for maintenance for herself
and her little ones at the hands of her
divorced: husband, Marcus Dye, a pros
perous contractor and builder. The
story she told was unusual. At its con
clusion Judge Graham was fully con
vinced of the justice of her appeal and
he cited Dye to appear next Friday to
show cause why he should not pay $75
forthwith and make further provision
for the permanent support of . his off
spring.
"Six days after the decree of divorce
separating me from my former hus
band was finally entered,"- said Mrs.
Dye, "my husband married Miss Violet
Styles, who was at one time employed
by me in our household. When he
wedded this young? woman my two lit
tle ones were 111 and of course I was
unable to leave them to earn sufficient
money to buy them medicines and pro
cure for them that care! they .should
have had. I;' was practically without
food, and notwithstanding our great
need Mr. ; Dye wedded this girl, and
while they drank champagne we Buf
fered from hunger. When we were
vorced the court ordered, him to'pay me
$25 a month for the Bupport of the little
ones. , He obeyed- the order for ten
months, but after that -he refused^ to
contribute toward our support. Though
he knows we are In need his heart has
not softened and only the court can
compel him to" obey."
.Turning "to" his clerk, Judge Graham
ordered that the directing Dye
to appear on Friday be issued forth
with. "And," : said Judge Graham,
"make; sure' that service - is properly
made. This is a case that demands im

SEEKS OCEAN
FOR SURCEASE
Mrs; Justinia Diicruet, Tired
of Life at the Age of 83,
Attempts to End All
EESCUED BY SOLDIERS
Octogenarian Tires of Her
Existence and Begs Her
Rescuers to Let Her Die
Mrs. JuÃtlnia: Ducruet, a widow 83
years old, attempted to commit suicide
about 7:30 o'clock last night by jump
ing into the surf from the Olympic pier
at the Oce.an Beach. Her rash act was
observed by three soldiers, who rushed
into the waves and dragged the unfor
tunate woman to safety. Mrs. Ducruet
was taken to th^a Park Hospital by Po
liceman Greggians, where she was re
vived by Dr. ; Charles'. Pinkham. ThÂ«
surgeon says she will-recover.
Mrs. Ducruet lives with her son The
odore at 123 Leroy place. He Is an up
holsterer, doing business at 515 Bush
street. â¢' Yesterday afternoon while her
son was; at work she took a car
for the beach, aftes having meditated
and decided on the suicide course.
Alone she wended her way along the
sands." It was ; near dark as the feeble
woman slowly climbed the ironwork of
the Olympic pier.. Three soldiers stroll-
Ing along the beach saw her â¢ walk
along the rude wharf with tottering
step and they wondered what was her
purpose. They arrested their walk and
stood watching her. Unmindful that
she was observed. Mrs. Ducruet crept
cautiously, along the precarious tim
bers. When - she believed she - had
reached water deep enough to drown in
she paused,' threw her wrinkled hands
up toward heaven and Jumped. She did
not utter a cry, .but the soldiers say
they heard a mufHed supplication, then
the splash.
When she was dragged from the
heavy undertow Mrs. Ducruet implored
her rescuers to let her die. She said
she wag old and sickly, of no more use
to any one and did not care to live.
DAVIS , OBJECTS TO
* GIFTS TO CHARITY
Tells Relatives Not to Give Array
the Money He Sent
\u25a0 to Them. -
It was demonstrated yesterday In thÂ« hear
ing of the contest to the . codicil of the will
of the late Samuel Davis before Judge Kerri
gan that the deceased millionaire demanded
from his relatives an observance of the same
thrift that enabled him to amass his great
fortune. This . fact was brought to light by
Mrs. Mary G. Stone, who was on the witness
stand identifying various letters written to her
by Davis and by her to him.
Mrs. Stone, while a resident of Churchill,
New York, cared for Davis' sister, Jane, at
that time Incompetent, and to Mrs. Stone Da
vis sent funds for the care of hia sister. In
many . letters, however, Davis was apprehen
sive lest a portion of the money sent for the
care of this sister should be given away to
the church or its ministers and he frequently
warned . the beneficiaries of his generosity
against making such gifts. In answer to one
of these letters, Mrs. Stone said:
'.'lt shall be as you wish. I will not give
any money away unless you request It. I do
not think that aunt could be flattered Into
giving at present. She does not ask for more
than is necessary. I do not put money of any
amount in her pocket book, only a - dollar or
two at a time, for she is so sure to forget what
she does with It. I have never given any
money away, only what I'have written to you
about. . I had no right to."
In one of her letters to Davis Mrs. Stone
spelled the word "habit" with two bs. Pills
bury, chief counsel for the proponents of the
codicil, pointed to this error in orthography as
an indication that any one is liable to misspell
a word, the spelling of the- word "ni-ece" In
the codicil, differing from Davis' usual way.^
being seized upon by the contestants aa a
strong â¢ indication of the correctness of their
contention that the codicil Is not genuine.
Theodore' Kytka, â¢ handwriting expert, was
called tp the stand at the opening of the aft
ernoon session. It Is expected that he will
occupy several days pointing out what he con
tends are evidences that the contested codicil
Is a forgery, as charged by the contestants.

MUST ACCEPT
$6000 SALARY
Members of District Court
of Appeal Are rDefeated
in Fight for Better Pay
The 'Justices of the District Court of
Appeal will have to content them
selves with salaries of $6000 a year
each for the next two years. The Su
preme Court has issued its fiat to that
effect and a $2000 partition of coolness
has been erected between the two
tribunals on the top floor of the Par
rott building, where hitherto existed
only bonds of friendship. The nine
District Justices collaborated in mak
ing out a case for themselves against
the State, but the higher court has
turned them down.
The action was a petition for a writ
of mandate to, compel Controller Col
gan to pay the recently appointed
Jurists at the rate of $8000 annually.
The =\u25a0: amendment ratified by the last
Legislature provided for the appoint
ment of nine Justices at a salary to
be the same as that paid the Justices
of the Supreme Court. At the time of
ratification the Justices of the Supreme
Court were receiving 1 salaries on thfl
basis of $6000 a year. The Legislature
provided that these officials should re
ceive salaries of $3000 a year.
A constitutional provision make* It
Impossible to increase the salary of
an incumbent official, so the remunera
tion must remain the same until new
Justices are elected or the present Jus
tices are re-elected. The District Jus
tices claimed that really the salary of
a Supreme Court Justice was $8000 and
that therefore theirs should be the
same.
The Supreme Court says the mem
bers of the Inferior tribunal may begin
on the $8000 a year salary In 1907 If
re-elected to office, but not until then.
Incidentally the opinion states that the
people will be requested to vote on a
constitutional amendment at .the next
State election providing for an Imme
diate increase In the salaries of Justices
of the Supreme Court. '
