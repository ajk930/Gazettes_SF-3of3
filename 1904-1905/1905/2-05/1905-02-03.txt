Mrs. Enos is 35 years old. Fifteen
years ago. as Miss Marian Peters,
daughter of Jason Peters, a wealthy
diamond merchant, she was a belle of
San Francisco. She still retains many
traces of her former charms. Because
of family pride she has refrained from

teen Far Out at Sea,
It is possible that Central America
once more has been the scene of a vol
cano horror such as seared the garden
lands of Guatemala and buried her peo
ple in ashes when Santa Maria burst
into sudden and fearful activity a few
years ago. This time the scene is laid
in Nicaragua. The volcano is Momo
tombo.
News of the awakening of this vol
cano from a long sleep was brought
here yesterday by the steamship City
of Sydney, which arrived from Central
America late Tuesday n.i?ht. Momo
tombo is situated thirty miles inland;
means of communication in that part
of the world are crude and slow. The
demands of commerce prevented the
liner waiting for details, but from ap
pearances when the liner left Corinto
on January 16 the latest eruption of the
volcano caused great damage to a wide
territory-
Three years ago Momotombo's sum
mit began to steam and for a while
those living in the vicinity of the moun
tain watched the vapor with alarm.
There was no eruption, however, and
until the morning of January 16 the
volcano appeared to be sleeping serene
ly. Early that morning thick vapors
were seen arising from the cone-shaped
top of the mountain. As the day wore
on the vapor increased in density, and
by noon the volcano was vomiting thick
clouds of black and yellow smoke. Sud
denly flames burst forth, and that
night Momotombo's summit was a blaz
ing torch, lighting the land as far as
the coast and casting the glare of its
fire far out to sea.
Before fne City of Sydney left Corinto
word was received that the inhabitants
of the villages at Momotombo's base
were flying for their lives and that for
miles around panic ruled the land.
Fears were felt in Corinto for the safety
of Leon, the largest city in Nicaragua,
having 50,000 inhabitants and situated
about eight miles away from the vol
cano. When the Sydney reached La
Libertad a cable was sent to Corinto
asking for details of the damage done
by the volcano, but no information
could be had.
The country surrounding Momotombo
is thickly populated and many valu
able coffee fincaa lie within the shadow
of the mountain. News travels slowly,
even bad news, in that easy-going land,
and it may be that not until the next
steamer comes up from there will the
outside world learn the extent of Nica
ragua's affliction.
Momotombo is 6150 feet high, and its
base forms a promontory in Lake
Managua, which runs into Lake Nica
ragua. Momotombo was in active erup
tion in 1852, and again fifteen years ago.
Once upon a time the missionaries bap
tized the burning mountains, but the
ceremony came into disfavor when
some monks who undertook to place
the cross on Momotombo never re
turned. Nicaragua has many volcanic
mountains and has been the scene of
some fearful eruptions. In 1535 the sum
mit of Coseguina was blown to atoms,
day was changed to night for a space
of several hundred square miles, the
sea was covered fÂ©r a distance of twen
ty-five miles from the volcano with
ashes and scoriae in layers so thick
that navigation was impeded, all ver
dure disappeared under a bed of dust
sixteen feet deep and the very shore
line encroached on the ocean and the
Gulf of Fonseca. The crash of the ex
plosion was heard on the Bogota up
lands, 100 miles away. The eruption
lasted forty-three hours, but the people
of the surrounding plains had time to
escape, with their domestic animals,
followed by wild beasts, birds and rep
tiles.

over the predicament in which he has
found himself. Senator Frank French,
who stands accused with three of his

assault to-night on Detective George
N. Tichenor. Supported by a gang of
men that scattered as soon as the
cowardly deed was committed, French
accosted Tichenor on the upper floor
of the Capitol rotunda and without a

him reeling with a blow over the right

for a moment and then hurried down

and Detective Henry Hartling. French's
gang scattered like chaff as soon as
they 3aw there was no chance to fur

French turned and left the building.
NO REDRESS FOR VICTIM.
Tichenor, accompanied by Attorney
Gould, immedlaely went to the com
mittee that is investigating Senators
French, Bunkers. Emmons and Wright
and related the story of the assault.
All of the members of the committee
characterized French's action as an
outrage and said they would use what
influence they could to see that it was
not repeated. When Tichenor asked
what possible redress he could have,
one of the committee said:
"While an outrage, the assault upon
you, Mr. Tichenor, was only a misde

from arrest on a misdemeanor charee

Therefore it was necessary to ask the

MEASURE IS AMENDED.
Senate Incorporates New Provisions
in the Recession Bill.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2.â The Yo
semite and Mariposa Grove recession
bills came up on special order in the
Senate this morning. After some dis
c ussion two important amendments
to the measure were made. One re
lates to the protection of vested
rights, in the event of recession; the
other requires the Government to ac
cept the parks within two years, fail
ure to do which operates as nullify
ing the bill, in the event of its passage.
The amendments are as follow:
This act shall take effect from and after
acceptance by the United States of America
of the recessions and regranu= herein made,
thereby forever releasing the State of Cali
fornia from further ci>st of malntaioiiiK the
â¢aid premises, the same to be held for all
tim,' by Uw Doited States of America for pub
lic use. resort and recreation and Imposing
on the United States of America the cost of
maintaining the Fame as a national park.
I'r.ivijt-d. however, that the recession and
regrant hereby made shall not affect vested
rights and interests of third persons.
" â¢ â¢ Provided, however, that the United
States of America shall accept this regrant
an'l recession on or before February' 1, 1907,
anil If not so accepted within said time this
a> t shall thereafter cease to be of any force
or effect.
Curtin objected to the amendments
on the ground that he was opposed to
the entire bill, but he met with little
support the committee report that the
measure be amended in accordance
with the foregoing receiving almost
unanimous support. The bill was
made the special order for Monday
next.
NEW KINDS OF COTTON
GROWN IN AUSTRALIA
One Is a Tree Cotton for Orchard Cul-
tivation and Yields Crop
First Season.
At the recent show of the Royal Agri
cultural Society of Victoria, at Mel
bourne, were two new varieties of cot
ton reported to be of exceptional qual
ity, grown by Dr. Thomatls at Cairns,
in the State of Queensland, reports
Consul General Bray. Dr. Thomatis
stated that one variety, named Cara
vonica I, gave the large yield of 1200
pounds of ginned cotton per acre, and
that it has been pronounced by Amer
ican, English and continental experts
to be of the value of lOd (20 cents) per
pound, and should be classed as a wool
cotton. The other variety, named Car
avohica 11. the yield of which is not
stated, is a silky cotton valued at Is
(24 ce,nts) per pound.
Caravonica I in yield and value is
stated to be far in advance of air other
cottons, and applications for seed have
been made from many countries. It is
a tree cotton, and is cultivated like an
orchard tree. It is planted seven feet
by seven feet apart, and when six
months old attains a height of seven
feet and bears a small crop the first
season. Slight pruning is necessary
each year to keep the tree robust and
of a convenient size for working. From
300 t8 600 bolls are said to be yielded
by a single tree In a season; and it is
claimed that seventy of these bolls will
make from one and three-quarters to
two and a half pounds of clean lint.â

Grace of Kastern Women.
Passing us occasionally, going to
Jerusalem with butter and eggs and
little lars of leben that showed their
thick creamy throats as they were
held up to us, were small companies
of women in single file. As one blue
procession went by the leader called
to us: "Why should you ride and we
â walk? Why is your lot better than
ours?" Given the opportunity for lei
surely argument we could not by any
philosophy have made satisfactory
answer. We could only admit the
fact as they saw it, and recognize the
universal world-plant of discontent.
They carry themselves, these
women, like figures on an antique
frieze. As they stride along holding
in sure balance on their heads their
jars and baskets of homely produce,
they tread the stony paths with the
grace and largeness of action that we
of the Occident have grown to regard
as belonging only to the age of the
Praxiteles.
The men are also admirable in the
simplicity of their costumes, the big
lines of their attitudes, the swing of
their draperies. I saw a youth ljjng
his mantle over his shoulder and fold
it about him exactly in the manner of
the classic Greek, sculptured ~m his
finely unconscious pose. God save the
day when these sons of Canaan clothe
their limbs In our ungainly garments.

"At what intervals do the trains

The interlocutor gave the guard a look

of the regular trains?" The guard be
came angered. "I tpld you we don't

LOWER HOUSE
IS KEPT BUSY
Committee Is Named to Pre
pare Amendment Relative
to Legislative Sessions
NORMAL SCHOOL BILL
Measures Beady for Third
Reading and Will Be
Acted Upon Next Thursday
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2.â At the
morning session of the Assembly
Speaker Prescott announced the steer
ing committee that is expected to
frame a constitutional amendment
changing the present law providing for
sessions of the Legislature â establish
ing the period for which it shall sit,
date of opening, salaries of members
and expenses. Stanton's proposed
measure, now before the House in a
much amended form as, returned by
the Committee on Constitutional
Amendments, will be used as the basis
upon which the steering committee will
build a measure satisfactory to the As
sembly.
Assemblyman McGowan was an
nouced as chairman of this committee
and the other members are Houser,
Stanton, Burke and Gates.
On motion of McGowan, Stanton's
proposed amendment was made a spe
cial order for Friday, February 10. At
that time the steering committee will
probably have further amendments in
shape.
Treadwell's bill granting the Board of
Harbor Commissioners of San Fran
cisco power to lease two blocks of land
lying along the , seawall on Jefferson
street, between Mason and Jones, was
reported by the Committee on Com
merce and Navigation and will now go
on the second reading file. Treadwell
still says he does not think the bill has
any special significance, as it is simply
of the same nature as others that have
been passed at previous sessions, giv
ing the board power to lease as the de
mand for water frontage extended, but
there is still a persistent rumor that
the Western Pacific has an Interest in
the measure, as there is property ad
joining the frontage concerned that
could be used for a terminal.
The Senate bill providing for the San
Francisco Normal School appropriation
of $150,000, which has passed the upper
house and is now ready for third read
ing in the Assembly, was made the
special order for next Thursday.
The strained relations that seem to
exist between Atkinson and Treadwell
of the San Francisco delegation effect
ed another momentous piece of legisla
tion. The resolution of the first named
for the appointment of another assist
ant sergeant-at-arms was reported fa
vorably by the committee. Had there
been no objection from the San Fran
cisco side it, might have passed, but
Treadwell protested and Anthony fell
into line.. Stanton made a motion to
lay on the table, and, Atkinson making
no effort to bring the matter to a vote,
the motion prevailed.
Chairman Duryea of the Judiciary
Committee signed a minority report
from that committee against the pas
sage of Thompson's bill, similar to one
by Stanton, making: verbal contracts
for the sale of realty binding. The ma
jority report of the committee was in
favor of the passage of the bill. The
names on the minority report are those
of Duryea, McGowan, King, Cleveland
and Burke.
The usual resolution providing for the
proper observance of Washington's
birthday was introduced by O'Brien
and adopted.
ACQUIRING WATER RIGHTS.
Assemblyman Ilartman Thinks Bill
Introduced May Prove Dangerous.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2. â Chairman
Hartman of the Assembly Committee
on Commerce and Navigation has still
in his keeping Assemblyman Barnes'
biH providing for the acquirement of
water rights on the ocean for power
purposes and has asked its author to
withdraw it altogether. Hartman
says that It may prove a very dan
gerous measure if passed and open a
way to the grabbing of valuable water
frontage not controlled by harbor
boards by the "mere erection of a
windmill," as he puts it. The impor
tant sections of the measure, which Is
a novel one, follows:

Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2.â Belshaw in
troduced a bill to-day relating to the
disqualiflcatitojis of Judges. Tt pro
vides that no Justice or Judge may sit
in any action in which he is a party
interested; when he is related to either
party or an officer of a corporation
â which is a party or to an attorney or
I'gent of either party, by consanguinity
or affinity, within the third degree.
It is also provided that when either
party files an affidavit that he believes
he cannot get a fair and impartial
trial before any Judge of a court of
record the said Judge must secure the
service of some other Judge.
McKee introduced a bill relating to
co-operation by county boards of Su
pervisors and incorporated bodies
known ajÂ» "associated charities" and
contributions to such societies. Under
the provisions of the bill sums of
money may be contributed to one so
ciety in a county, but shall not exceed
$1000 in any one month.
The object of the bill is to sys
tematize the work of relief of depend
ent poor.
Senator Wolfe of San Francisco to
day introduced a bill which is design
ed to prevent the sale of or dealing in
of warehouse receipts purporting to
represent goods or merchandise con
tained in any other State. Senator
Wolfe says the bill is favored by the
wholesale liquor dealers in California.
It is intended to prevent frauds upon
retail dealers by having Eastern liquor
agents come into California and pro
cure money from them upon ware
house receipts for barrels of whisky.
The custom has been, it is alleged, for
liquor agents to come from the East,
display receipts to retail dealers, make
sales for several barrels of whisky
upon the strength of the receipts and
then take the notes of the saloon-keep
ers for payment. Later on the saloon
keepers, in most instances, would learn
they could not get any of the â¢ liquor
until their notes were paid in full.
The following bills were among those
passed to-day:
By Woodwardâ Senate bill No. 104,
to authorize certain corporations to
act as executor and in other capacities,
and to provide fon and regulate the ad
ministration of trusts by such cor
porations. Each corpocation, before
accepting any such appointment or de
posit, shall deposit with the State
Treasurer for the benefit of creditors
a sum equal to 50 per cent of the cap
ital of the corporation in bonds or
other securities.
By RuÃhâ No. 269, to transfer the
Veterans' Home at Yountville, Napa
County, to the Federal Government, to
be conducted as a national home for
soldiers, sailors and marines of the
United States under the existing laws.
The bill of Senator Keane directed
against trading stamps or coupon de
vices in the transaction of business
came up for third reading in the Sen
ate to-day, but at the request of the
author it was sent back to the Ju
diciary Committee. This was done to
give the trading stamp people an op
portunity to be heard.
LOAN COMPANIES' INQUIRY.
Senate Committee Will Treat All Cor-
porations Alike,
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2.â The special
Senate committee, consisting of Wood
ward (chairman), Hahn.Curtin, Lynch
and Anderson, appointed by the presi
dent of the upper house to carry on
the investigation of building and loan
associations In place of the Committee
on Commissions and Retrenchment,
tour of the members of which are on
trial on charges of bribery, met and
organized to-night. â  It decided to hold
its first meeting next Tuesday night
and begin the investigation of the
Continental Building and Loan Asso
ciation.
Rules were formulated and it was
announced that the meetings would be
held in the Senate chamber If it could
be obtained for the purpose, and the
public will be admitted.
"Following the investigation of the
Continental, which under the turn af
fairs have taken it Is deemed should
be put first on the list, we will look Into
the affairs of other companies, treat-
Ing all exactly alike In the matter of
examining Into their condition and
their methods of doing business," said
a member of the committee. "We will
adhere rigidly- to the resolution passed
by the Senate.
"Our sole purpose will be to deter
mine whether the companies are ad
hering to the laws that exist and to
frame new laws in case we find that
that protection to investors and stock
holders demands them."
The Assembly Committee on Building
and Loan Associations intended to
frame a law with some changes from
the existing one to go before that body,
but it Is understood that, under the
advice of Speaker Prescott, it will leave
the matter of taking the initiative to
the Senate, In the hope that whatever
bill goes through thd upper house may
be satisfactory.

aside the shadow of the penitentiary.
So next Monday night when the trial
again goes on, witnesses will come for
this purpose from Downieville and San
Diego and many points between and
behind them will follow an army of
the prosecution's witnesses to prove
that what the witnesses for the defense
say is not based on truth. And, it is
estimated, this will cost the State about
$15,000, this swearing of one force that
the detectives are not to be believed,
the other that they are. Questions of
character come high, but the defense
must have them and, as it must, the
prosecution must fall in line.
District Attorney A. H. Seymour of
Sacramento says none of the Senators
accused of accepting bribes will be ar
rested until after the investigation now
on before the special committee looking
into the charges against them has fin
ished its labors.
ARRESTS ARE TO FOLLOW.
"Although I have the power to have
warrants for the arrest of these men
issued at any time I will take no ac
tion toward their apprehension until
after the investigation is ended," he
said to-night, "as I do not want to be
in a position where either side can say
I prejudiced its case by instituting
criminal proceedings before the Senate
committee had concluded its work.
"Specific action was taken in Jor
dan's case because he is not a Senator
and his arrest could have no influence
either way upon the case against the
accused legislators. Furthermore the
Senate has no Jurisdiction over Jor
dan other than to force his appear
ance as a witness."
The Sacramento District Attorney is
a quiet, undemonstrative man, who has
the appearance of wishing to know his
ground well before he takes a radical
step. His words leave little doubt that
the â¢ accused Senators, or at least
Bunkers and Emmons, will be arrested
on charges of having accepted bribes
as soon as their hearing Is ended.
Joseph S. Jordan seems cheerful and
declares that he is in no danger. He
says he has a sufficient explanation to
make at the proper time and that none
of his frieitds need worry about him.
He is about town as he was before his
name was connected with the bribery
scandal, the smile for which he is
noted seeming to have been dimmed
but little by the trouble that has come
to him.
TRYING TO TRACE BniA
The prosecution in the bribery cases
admits that its detectives are search

bills will bring very fair prii es. Up
to this time there is no evidence that
the people that laid the trap for thf
alleged briketakers had any detectives
to follow them up and watch to see if
they spent any of the bills given them.
It is said, however, that they were fol
lowed immediately after the money is
alleged to have been given them aril
that one of them changed a $50 bill
in a saloon. The detective, it is al
leged, stepped up to the bar a moment:
liter with $50 in gold and said hÂ«
wanted a bill of that denomination.
'"I Just got one a few minutes ago,"
the bartender is reported. to have said,
and handed over the one passed by the
accused Senator.
One can hear all sorts of storiea Ilk
this in Sacramento at present. An
other Is that all the money has been
turned back to Jordan, and that he will
produce it and say he never arave it tÂ»
the Senators, and that they knew noth
ing about It. That he was only trying
to see whether the building and loan
companies would attempt bribery. This
is discredited on the ground that in
Sacramento during a legislative session
it is against all ethics to ever arive any
money back, and that it would be un
likely that some of the paper. If re
ceived, as charged, was not b*o|ft]

It is not an infrequent thins to se~

the street lights at the distances the
detectives said they saw the money
they allege Jordan handed to Emmons
and Bunkers. Some men have observM
in a test as to whether a roll of bills
could be grabbed with both hands at
once, as it was intimated was the Sen
atorial practice in the case under in
vestigation.
The accused Senators are seen about
town as much as ever and all of them
present a brave front. They appear at
times at the hearing before the com
mittee appointed to lnvestljratf them,

H<M-H MAY HAVE LEFT
A WIFE IN GERMANY
Man Who Knew Him There Said He ;
Was Married When He Came
to America.
NEW YORK, Feb. â Johann Hoch j
v.as arraigned in the Jefferson Market!
CoCrt to-day and remanded until Sat
urday, when requisition papers are ex
pected to arrive from Chicago.
. "This talk about my having twenty
or thirty wives and murdering a few of ;
them is all nonsense," he said while be- i
taken back to police headquarters. !
"'Just let them go on and pile It on me
as much as they please. I'll make some
of them very sorry when I get back to j
Chicago. , It is a case of mistaken iden
tity. There are more Hochs In the
West than, one.*-'
According to the police Hoch said he
r.ould plead guilty to bigamy upon his '
return to Chicago. He said he had |
married twice, the police allege, but :
that when he took a second wife he be
lieved his former wife had obtained a
divorce froth him. Concerning the
charge of murder Hoch said:
"They axe accusing me of crimes that
are said to have occurred in this coun- j
try long before I came here ten years
ago. I will prove by documentary evi
dence that I was In Germany prior to
the time these crimes were committed."
Jol-ji Graf of Gensingen, Bingen-on
the-Rhine, where Hoch "*-aa reared,
was a caller at police headquarters to- |
day. He told the detectives that he was
â¢ certain he had known Hoch in Gen
si ngf-n. where he passed \as Jacob
Schmidt, until he left there about ten
years ago and came to this country as
a diamond agent, having lost his for-
tune. Graf declares that If Hoch is the
â  same a* Jacob Schmidt he was mar
in Germany.
CHICAGO. Feb. 2.â An Indictment for
n urder against Johann Hoch, the al
poisoner of many wives, will be
i for by Coroner Hoffman.

Special Dispatch to the Call.
"Will you swear just as positively
that Oroni was convicted on the first
trial and acquitted on the second,"
said Gould.
WITNESS BECOMES CONFUSED.
"i can't swear to anything," said
the witness, becoming confused.
"Will you swear," I again ask- said
Gouid, "that Oroni was convicted on
the first trial and acquitted on the
second."
â¢ Yes, I will," answered Littlejohn. "'I
â raa a witness in that case myself. I
know that he was acquitted on the sec
ond trial."
The witness was then dismissed.
Kartling announced that on rebuttal
he would produce the records to show
that on the first trial of Oroni the jury
disagreed; at the second trial he was
convicted of murder in the first degree,
but was granted a new trial and re
leased on motion of the District Attor
ney, who held that it would be impos
sible to secure more evidence than had
already been introduced, and that, fur
thermore, the witnesses had scattered
to the four corner of the earth during
the time that elapsed between his con
viction and the granting of the new
trial. He would also prove, he said,
that his testimony is still in the record
and was never thrown out.
As soon as Littlejohn was dismissed
Attorney Cator made another state
men* regarding the necessity of delay.
He said that it would take some time
to get all of the witnesses the defense
intended to bring to impeach Detec
tives Tichenor and Hartling. Some
would have to come from the southern
portion of the State, he said, and
others from the north. It would take
time to gather them in, and, although
he did not want to delay the hearing,
it was imperative that he .be given
time.
JORDAN IS WANTED.
Senator Simpson, a member of the
committee, said that while he beiieved
the defense should be given all the time
it required, he was not so sure that it
could not proceed. He said the com
mittee wanted to hear from every one
whose names had been mentioned in
any way in connection with the charges
of bribery, and especially wanted to
hear from Joseph S. Jordan. It was a
summary proceeding and one that was
being held in the interest of the people
only and to subserve no special pur
pose.
Gould then explained the position his
side occupies.
"We have no desire," said Gould,
"to earn- this question to a further
prosecution, recognizing the fact that
this is a matter that rests with the
committee. We have presented our
case, but felt that it is our duty to
remain here and protect those who
have testified and whoy characters
are now being assailed. There is no
question but that there is always
some one that is willing to assail the
CORONER JACKSON GUILTY
OF ATTEMPTED BRIBERY
'Jury Recommends That Clemency Be
Extended to the New York
Official.
XEW YORK, Feb. 2.â The jury
which has been considering a charge
of attempted bribery against Coroner
Moses J. Jackson of this city brought
in a verdict of guilty late to-night,
after six hours' deliberation. The
foreman said the jury made a strong
recommendation for clemency. Jack
son was greatly affected at the out
come of the trail.
Coroner Jackson was tried on an in
dictment charging that he demanded
a bribe from Benjamin Reass, a law
yer, in connection with the arrest of
a physician charged with malpractice.
The case had been on trial for several
days before Recorder Goff. Among
the witnesses was Deputy Assistant
District Attorney Charles Chadwlck,
who made grave charges against the
Coroner. Sentence was not passed to

Attorney for Realty Syndicate Anx-

BACRAMENTO. Feb. 2.â Last Mon
day Harmon Bell, one of the attorneys
for the Realty Syndicate of Oakland,
arrived In Sacramento in response to
a summons his company had received
to come up and be put through the mill
at 517 Tenth street. Bell did not allow
the collapse of the Committee on Com
missions and Retrenchments, through
the alleged bribing of Its members, to
stop an investigation of the syndicate.
He iE in town to-night a-ain demand
ing of the special committee, of which
"Woodward is chairman, that a thor
ough examination of the affairs of his
corporation be held as soon as possible.
He says that certain attacks that have
been made against the Realty Syndi

and that he wants an opportunity to
prove at the earliest possible time their
falsity and the maliciousness that ac
tuated them.

character of any man that lives if he
so desires, and, knowing that the de
fense purposes following this line of
policy. I have a suggestion to make
that will save time. If the defense
will tell us what general lines It in
tends to pursue in an effort to im
peach these witnesses, and also tell
us what specific acts involving tur
pitude it may claim these men have
committed, we will send subpenas
along with theirs to bring men to off
set their testimony. If they do not
care to do this, then the case will be
delayed, because we will have to ask
for time in which to get our people
perhaps from distant points."
CHARGE OF CONSPIRACY.
Attorney Copeland, misunderstand
ing Gould's suggestion, began to talk
of constitutional rights for his clients
and nefarious conspiracies that had
been concocted by "the best organ
izer in California," meaning McNab.
"Before we get through," continued
Copeland, "we will make it plain that
this is a conspiracy to enable these
people to carry out and protect and
secure a continuance of the company's
nefarious practices. All we ask is the
privileges that are guaranteed us by
the constitution."
Gould informed Copeland that he
had formed an absurdly erroneous idea
o* his purpose in asking that the sub
penas issue at the same time, and after
some further discussion Copeland
agreed to his proposal, so far as he
thought he should in justice to the in
ttrests of his clients. As a result sub
penas will be scattered all over the
State to-day. Copeland said he spe
cially wanted to get some of the most
prominent men of Bakersfiejd to tes
tify; men whose word could not be
overcome by any force the prosecution
could bring against them.
"Oh, you mean those men that killed
some people down in the cil fields," said
Gould. "You mean those men that
Tichenor detected."
â¢ I am willing that you bring men to
testify to the good character of your
witnesses, if you can find them," said
Copeland as a parting shot.
COXTIXUAXCt IS GRANTED.
/We could find plenty of witnesses if
we only had those greenbacks you've
got." retorted Gould.
Prior to adjournment the committee
consulted as tp the best manner to pro
ceed in the hearing Of the character
witnesses. It was announced that if
the rules of evidence In this instance
were violated the case would be
come interminable, so the committee
ordered that both sides should proceed
in strictly legal form. It further an
nounced that in the view of the com
mittee this line of testimony did not
directly bear upon the case, which
view was responsible for the order that
rules of law be closely followed.
The trial of the accused was then con
tinued to Monday next at 8 p. m.

case of the one we are now discussing."
Tlchenor said that he had no fear
but that he would be able to take care
of himself, if French or any other of
the accused sought him out slnele
handed, but as he had had several ex
periences during his career as a detec
tive with gangs of ruffians he had
learned that it is futile for any one
man to attempt to handle a dozen.
Attorney Gould advised Tichenor to
take no action in the matter; to let the
matter drop and the odium rest where
it does. Tichenor said that such was
his intention, but that he might have
to abandon that Intention in order to
save his own life, if reports that had
reached him were based on facts. The
members of the committee then went to
their seats, and Tichenor walked to
ward the lobby. In a few minutes he
came back and said:
"A message was just brought to me
to the effect that I was wanted at the
telephone. I started out, but a friend
stopped me and said that there was no
one waiting to talk to me on the tele
phone; that the message was Intended
as a decoy to get me out into the cor
ridor where French and his pane had
again taken up position with the in
tention to do me up. This friend told
me that French had vowed to do me uo
but hereafter I will be on my guard
and do not fear that he will injure me.
"French's assault upon me to-night
goes far toward corroborating my
sworn statement that I saw him take a
roll of bills from Joseph S. Jordan as a
bribe, in accordance with the nefarious
conspiracy of which the State is now
so well apprised. I know that he took
the bills and he knows that I know it.
It is but natural that he should assault
me. This is in keeping with his de
pra\Â«ed mode of reasoning. If he should
assault any one. however, if he wished
to bolster up his story that he is inno
cent, the object of his wrath should be
Joseph S. Jordan.
"He would know by this time that
Joseph S. Jordan is guilty even if he
were innocent, and if he were innocent
he would know that Joseph S. Jordan
was responsible for the stain that now
rests upon him. If I were innocent and
a man brought the disgrace upon me
that Joseph S. Jordan has brought
upon him, I would take that man to
task. But French does not reason this
way. Far from it, for since Jordan has
been out of jail French has had many
a confidential chat with him. He as
saulted me because I told the truth
and he knew I told the truth. His is
the rage that fills the breasts of all
men of his kind when they are cor
nered. I know, because as a detective
I have cornered many of his kind.
FIRES BULLET
INTO HIS BODY
11. E. Miller of San Francisco
Attempts to Kill Himself
on ml Overland Train
THOUGHT TO BE INSANE
Tel is Story of Fearing Ar
rest in Connection With
the Legislative Scandal
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA, Feb. 2.â With a bullet
wound just ever his heart H. E. Miller
of 4024 Eighteenth street, San Francis
co, is writhing in agony to-night in an
Oxnard hospital. Whether Miller was
insane when he shot himself or had
some guilty knowledge of the scandal
at Sacramento is a mooted question.
Miller tried to kill himself on the
overland train last night this side of
Chatsworth tunnel and while on his
way from Los Angeles to San Fran
cisco. He had been working in this sec
tion as an agent of the Continental
Building and Loan Association of San
Francisco and was in Oxnard last Sat
urday. At that time he hunted up the
Marshal, to whom he told a story to the
effect that his company was now being
investigated at Sacramento and that he
expected at any time to be arrested
and haled before the legislative com
mittee. He assured the Marshal that
he would be on hand when wanted.
He then purchased a ticket for this
place, but nothing more was heard
from him until his tragic attempt on
his life.
Miller was in a touri6t sleeper and
showed a new pistol to some of the
passengers, saying that he bought it to
kill a man. It was but a short time
after this until a shot rang out in the
car and Miller fell over with a bullet
in his side. He was taken off the train
at Oxnard and at that time It was
thought he could live but a few hours.
At the hospital it was found that the
wound, while a bad one, was not neces
sarily fatal. Miller is now raving and
it takes several attendants to hold him
in bed.
Miller has been employed by the Con
tinental Building and Loan Associa
tion as a traveling agent for several
years past and was considered a trust
worthy employe. He left this city sev
eral days ago on a business trip in the
southern part of the State. His em
ployers say he was always perfectly
rational and is not known to have ex
pressed a desire to end his life.
Miller resided with his wife and three
children at 4024 Eighteenth street. Mrs.
Miller was greatly shocked when she
learned of her husband's attempt on
his life. She left last night for Ven
tura,

TERRITORY MAY
BECOME COLONY
Rumor Has It That Govern
ment of Hawaiian Islands
Is About to Be Changed
ADVANTAGES CLAIMED
Senator Foraker and Con
gressman Tawney Are Said
to Be Fathers of the Flan
Bpecial Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU. Jan. V.â lt is rumored
that Hawaii may change its form of
government from territorial to colon
ial. The story is traced back to Con
gressman Tawney and Senator For
aker.
The advantages to Hawaii of such
a political change are described as (1)
the control of island customs, internal
revenue and postal systems, (2) free
dom to seek labor of any kind in any
market, (3) the renewal of the recip
rocity treaty or the passage of a gen
oral act establishing free trade be
tween the colonies and the mother
country and (4) a wider diffusion tof
prosperity.
The disadvantages are described as
(1) the abandonment of the American
idea in Hawaii, (2) the surrender of tha
statehood privilege, (3) the danger
that, on changes of party in the Uaited
States, a strong voting element would
grow up to oppose the continued free
admission of such colonial products as
may compete, like sugar and tobacco,
with mainland agriculture; (4) the de
struction of our leading industry as a
logical sequence of a radical protective
policy in the United States.
Senator Foraker is credited with
'having said:
"When you come to Washington asking for
special appropriations you meet the opposition
o< mainland communities much larger that ad
vance their claims over yours and must be
provided for. The Treasury may make what
rule it likes to accept customs receipts in
drafts so as not to drain away your gold. The
fact remains that your people are drained, and
you cannot get any special relief, so long as
you hold your Territorial status. You are in
the team, and you must help pull the load.
The colt, Porto Rico. troU aionÂ« where It
likes, petted and Indulged, and there Is the
hope that It may yet grow up to takÂ« its place
in the team. But there Is no hurry about it.
Its products have free entry into the markets
of the mainland; Its labor conditions and Its
general needs are properly made the objects of
special legislation, and no one objects. Porto
Rico is a possession, not an Integral part of
the country. The whole policy of the Ameri
can republic bids as be. kind and Indulgent to
the insular possessions.
They may be sold, of course, but the Ameri
can policy "and the American people would be
against that. And it is possible that, at some
future time, tnÂ«ro might be a duty placed upon
Island sugar shipped to the mainland mar
kets. But the American sense of fairness would
not long submit to that, either. Even a Dem
ocratic administration, while It might lower
the tariff wall, would not dare do anything
that would Imperil' the prosperity of ths Insular
possessions.
Hawaii, as a part of the country, a terri
tory, gets no such consideration. It must
stand or fall with the rest, despite tha radi
cally different conditions thers. And I believe.
If this were made clear to Island people, there
would be a radical change of sentiment In the
matter. As for statehood, a possession has aa
good a chance to grow Into that as a terri
tory.

NERVOUS DYSPEPSIA.
A CURE FOR ALL.
XÂ«H a Patent Cure- AIL Nor a Modern
Miracle, but Simply a Rational
Cure for Dyspepsia.
In these days of humbug^ery and de-
ception, the manufacturers of patent
medicines, as a rule, seem to think
their medicines will not sell unless they
claim that It will cure every disease
under the sun. And they never think
of leaving out dyspepsia, and stomach
troubles. They are sure to claim that
â¦heir nostrum Is absolutely certain to
cure every dyspeptic and he need look
no further.
In the face of these absurd claims It
la refreshing to note that the proprie-
tors of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have
carefully refrained from making any
undue claims or false representations
regarding the merits of this most ex-
cellent remedy for dyspepsia and stom-
ach troubles. They make but one
claim for it, and that is, that for lndi-
geFtion and various stomach troubles
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets is a radical
cure. They go no further than this,
and any man or woman suffering from
indigestion, chronic or nervous dyspep-
cfcL, who will give the remedy a
trial will find that nothing is claimed
for it that the facts will not fully sus-
tain.
It is a modern discovery, composed of
harmless vegetable ingredients accept-
able to the weakest or most delicate
Btomarh. Its great' success in curing
stomach troubles is due to the fact
that the medicinal properties are such
that It will digest whatever wholesome
food is taken into the stomach, no
matter whether the stomach is in good
working order or not. It reste the
overworked organ and replenishes the
body, the blood, the nerves, creating a
healthy appetite, giTing refreshing
6leep and the blessings which always
accompany a good digestion and
proper assimilation of food.
In using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
no dieting is required. Simply eat
plenty of wholesome food and take
these Tablets at each meal, thus assist-
ing and resting the stomach, which
rapidly .regains its proper digestive
power, when the Tablet will be no
longer required.
Nervous Dyspepsia is simply a con-
dition In which some portion or por-
tions of the nervous evetem are not
properly nourished. Good digestion in-
viporates tlie nervous system and
every organ In the body.

LONDON, Feb. 3.â The correspond

"The strike is failing through lack
of money behind the organizers. For
daye before the demonstration reached
its climax bodies of the worst type ot
malcontents concentrated In Warsaw

Wholesale blackmail by the police of

asserts that citizens are stopped in the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 3, 1905.
Report of Novelist
Gorky's Release
Unconfirmed.
Officiaf figures on
the Riots in St.
Petersburg,
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 3. 3:10 a. m.
Detailed reports filed at the headquar
ters of the St. Petersburg military dis
trict, where minute records are kept,
show that in breaking up the demon
stration of January 22 of the thousands
of troops on guard only 480 shots were
actually fired. These troops represented
eight different units, from a squad of
eight to a company of 120, And the total
number of ball cartridges expended was
li) 02. The authorities point out that
this indicated that there was no reck
less or general volleying. The number
of wounded in the hospitals to-day is
208,
The report of Maxim Gorky's release
apparently is either incorrect or, if true,
he was released on the promise to leave
St. Petersburg without the slightest de
lay. He had not returned home up to a
late hour last night. The friend with
whom he lives and who was permitted
to visit him yesterday afternoon for the
first time since his arrest said that he
found the author still in solitary con
finement in the St. Peter and St. Paul
fortress.
The novelist, whose real name is not
Maxim Gorky, which Is a pseudonym
meaning "Maxim the Bitter," but
Alexis Pyeshkoff, did not expect release
for some time and did not know wheth
er he would be brought before the court
for trial or deported by administrative
order. He philosophically proposed to
devote his period of imprisonment to
learning the English language and
remedying other deficiencies in the
peasants' education. He begged his
friends to procure text books of Eng
lish and German natural sciences, etc.
At present he speaks only Russian.
The latest reports received by Consul
General Watts from the American Con
suls in Russia indicate a cessation of
the trouble in most of the industrial
centers of the country.
The Consul at Riga reports that the
rioting at that place was precipitated
by students and rowdies, who fired on
the 'police. The police and troops re
turned the fire and fifty-three persons
were killed and 150 wounded.
At Reval the soldiers were obliged to
defend a factory on Saturday against
a mob. Three rioters were killed and
several others were wounded.
Emperor Nicholas has signed the ap
pointment of Muravieff, Minister of
Justice, to be Embassador of Russia at
Rome. Manukhin, hitherto the assist
ant of Minister Muravieff, has been
promoted to Minister of Justice. Swe
reff, chief Russian press censor, has
been removed from his post.
Bouligans appointment as Minister
eff the Interior was signed yesterday,
although it has not yet been promul
gated. It is believed his appointment
will be only temporary.
The friends of Prince Sviatopolk-
Mirsky express regret, for the sake of
his future fame, that he did not resign
the moment it became apparent that
the policy on which he assumed office
was not attainable.

Comely Mulatto Girl Weds
Negro Who . Will Spend
Best of His Days in Jail
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2.â Without
the knowledge of half a dozen or more
turnkeys and a score of visitors a mar
riage was performed in the County Jail,
and not one of the persons who wit
nessed it knew of the ceremony until
more than a week later.
Archie Hill, a negro, who is under a
life sentence for the murder of a street
railway conductor in Pasadena, is the
groom and Roberta Blackman. a come
ly mulatto, who had known Hill be
fore the killing, was the bride. They
had not been lovers until after Hill eot

be present at his examination and
was attracted to him. She visited him
at the County Jail, and after Hill waÃ
convicted she viÃited him every visit
or's day at the Jail. Several weeks aero
he asked her to marry him and she con
sented.
Hill applied to the Sheriff for permis
sion to marryi and when the matter
was presented to the District Attorney
the latter refused to give his consent to
the marriage for the reason that Hill Is
legally dead. Then the young woman
secured a marriage license and, accom
panied by a negro preacher whom she
had paid well to act, she went to the
Jail at a time when scores of persons
were congregated at the wire netting
through which prisoners talk to their
visitors. There, in a whisper, the mar

Four Russian Regiments
Almost Annihilated During

to Resume the Combat.

Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald, Copyright, 1905, by
the New York. Herald Publishing Company. - .
LONDON, Feb. 2.â Field Marshal
Oyama, reporting details of the battle
of the Hun, says the Russians had at
least seven divisions, with one of cav
alry. Four regiments were nearly an
nihilated. Many companies were re
duced to twenty and thirty men. The
Japanese casualties, he admits, were
7000.
TOKIO, Feb. 2.â Field Marshal Oya
ma, telegraphing yesterday, reported
that the extreme Japanese left held a
line along the Hun River, with its ex
treme left established on the right
bank. The main body of the Russians
after their defeat at Helyoutai retired
across the Hun River and occupied
Niuyupao, Shufangtai and a portion of
Changtan. On Wednesday the Rus
sians began constructing defensive
works in the neighborhood of Shufang
tai, Chungchiawopeng and Changtan.
Russian cavalry patrols were seen. The
Russians made a series of small attacks
on the right army and the left flank of
the left army, but were repulsed in
each instance.
Details of the fighting from January
25 to January 29, which Field Marshal
Oyama officially designates as the bat
tle of Seikoutal, show that the opera
tions were more extensive, the forces
engaged larger and the fighting more
desperate than the first reports indi
cated. The Japanese casualties totaled
7000. According to the Japanese esti
mate the Russians lost more than 10,
000. The armies fought in a driving
snowstorm.
HEADQUARTERS OF GENERAL
OKU, Feb. 2.â The Russian force re
mains opposite the Japanese left wing,
occasionally firing, but no serious at
tacks are attempted. Some movement
of the Russians is noticeable along
their entire front and the bombardment
of the Japanese lines Is continued at in
tervals. The Japanese seldom reply to
the Russian fire.
It is evident that both armies are
preparing for a battle when the weath
er moderates. The temperature was 13
degrees below zero (Fahrenheit) last
night. It is believed that the present
period of cold weather will be the last
of the season.
SCHWAB MAY BUILD A NAVY.
Russia Interesting American Capital in
Her War Plans.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 2. â The
Admiralty, having- definitely committed
itself to the policy of rebuilding and
greatly Increasing the size of the navy,
although the detailed programme has
not yet been completed, is already be
ing besieged by foreign firms anxious
to obtain contracts. These firms are
having little success, however, as only
a single French firm has thus far ob
tained a contract for a large ship.
Several other contracts may be award
ed; but the Admiralty has decided, in
stead of placing contracts abroad, to
attract foreign capital to Russia for
the erection of wards, with the general
purpose of encouraging and creating a
vast ship-building industry at home,
which eventually will render the coun
try completely independent of foreign
builders.
The Admiralty is displaying a friend
ly disposition toward the United States
and there is reason to believe that the
Admiralty already has received an of
fer from American capitalists who are
willing to embark in the enterprise
on the condition of obtaining suffi
ciently large contracts. Charles M.
Schwab's approaching visit is believed
to be directly connected with this
proposition.
OYAMA MAY LOSE SANDEPAS.
Defenders of Strategic Point Are in
Critical Position.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 2. â The
War Office to-day had not received
any further official dispatches from
Manchuria and nothing was known of
the counter attack of the Japanese
from Sandepas. According to the lat
est official information, the bombard
ment is continuing. The general staff
was reluctant to express an opinion,
but it was not considered improbable
that the Japanese would find them
selves compelled to abandon Sande
pas, for, as pointed out in dispatches
from Mukden, the position of the de
fenders must be well-nigh untenable
on account of the burning down of the
houses surrounding Hjj> central strong
hold, which is still held by the Japan
ese. Being their 'citadel, it is com
pletely covered with earth and pierced
only with loopholes and embrasures
for guns and therefore the smoke
from the conflagration and powder
gases makes it most difficult for the
\
defenders to breathe. In addition, un
der the pounding of mortars and
heavy artillery, any fortification, how
ever strong, must gradually crumble.
WOUNDED MEN FREEZE.

TSINKHETCHEN, Manchuria, Mon
day, Jan. 30. â The Japanese offensive
in the neighborhood of Dzlantchan,
fourteen milea southeast of Tsinkhet
chen, has everywhere been beaten off.
The Japanese left ' their killed and
carried off a couple of hundred
wounded. The Russians subsequently
found a large number of frozen
corpses of Japanese wounded, who
had tried to crawl off from Chenhatin
Pass. The appearances of these corpses
was frightful. The bodies were scant
ily clad. One hundred Japanese
corpses were found on the field.

MUItDEN, Feb. I.â After the Rus
sian bombardment of Sandepas yes
terday the Japanese tried to drive
them off, but failed. The indications
that the Japanese will abandon
Sandepas. The usual artilley duel is
proceeding at the center. Ten Jap
anese battalions which attacked the
Russian left were repulsed with heavy
losses. The latest returns of the Rus
sian losses during the recent fighting
show that 13,000 men were killed or
wounded. General Kondratovitch be
ing among the latter.
Treatment of Japanese Prisoners.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 2. â Vice
Consul Thomas Smith of Moscow, by
direction of the American embassy,
has visited the Japanese prisoners of
war at Medved, in pursuance of the
request of the Japanese Government
and reports that he found them com
fortably housed and fed, but com
plaining of various restrictions, the
most Important of which related to
transmission of their mall. Professor
Maartens, the head of the prison bu
reau, has promised to correct this
matter of complaint and to investigate
the other complaints.

SCOTT RESIGNS
AS SECRETARY
Quits Chamber of Commerce
To-Day and B. L. Cadwai
ader Will Succeed Him
Eben Scott will to-day retire as sec
retary of the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce and the trustees of the
chamber will elect as his successor
Bertrand L. Cadwalader, who recently
resigned as secretary for the Police
Commissioners. The retirement of Mr.
Scott from the office of secretary is
entirely voluntary. He has interests
that require his undivided attention.
Some months ago he notified the trus
tees of hia desire to retire. He was
requested to remain until a successor
could be selected. The trustees will
take formal action to-day both re
garding his resignation and the elec
tion of his successor.
Eben Scott has been secretary of
the Chamber of Commerce ever since
I the retirement of William L. Merry,
about seven years ago. Merry was ap
pointed United States Minister to Cen
[â  tral American republics. In the seven
years last past the business of the
Chamber of Commerce has been
largely increased and its field of ac
tivity has been broadened. Much of
this is attributed to the energy of
; Scott. It is understood Mr. Scott will
engage in the brokerage business.
Bertrand L. Cadwalader is well
known as an athlete and football
player and is a member of the Olym
pic Club. The position of secretary
is worth $200 a month. The tenure
of office is during good behavior.
There have been only four incumbents
of the place in twenty years.

George Crick of Grass Valley re
ported to the police yesterday that
his valise and a bundle of blankets
had been stolen from him in the wait

his gold watch, valued at $25, was
stolen from his cabin. Mrs. Muldoon,
224 Elm avenue, reported that a coal
oil stove, valued at $13. had been
stolen from a vacant house at 725 1 -i
Turk street. M. L. West reported that
his laundry, valued at $12 50, had
been stolen from the office counter at

ââ *â ;..- â  - â¢ â 
Negro Question. He Asserts,
Alone Prevents the Disrup
tion of the Democracy
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2.â The post- j
office appropriation bill was still under :
consideration when the . House - ad- j
journed to-day. A provision for special 1
mail facilities on trunk lines was re- j
tamed in the bill. A mild sensation was .
created by Baker of New York, who :
â¢aid that the voting: of mail subsidies I
was the way to kill the Democratic :
party. Baker denounced certain mem- \
bers of the party for having foisted j
Judge Parker on them as their candi- j
t ate for President, saying that his can- i
didacy had been initiated and manipu- j
lated by monopolists. ;
street of Indiana in closing: the j
debate declared that the man who !
voted for the bill on its passage was
compelled tQ vote for subsidies, because ;
the bill was lull of them.
"Gentlemen," he paid, "cannot afford "
to take umbrage at the word 'sub- â¢
sidy.' "
Then, turning to Morris of Nebraska, ;
who yesterday moved to strike out the
provision for special facilities, Over
â tree* reminded him that every rural
free delivery route was a subsidy. v ;
The motion to strike out the provi- â¢
6ion was defeated â to 115. ,
Baker of New York demanded tellers. .
He DOOM muster only ten supporters, j
among them Williams of Mississippi,
the minority leader. Finding that tell
ers had been refused, Baker, shaking
his first at those Democrats who had
not voted with him and raising his
voice to the highest pitch, shouted: 1
"That is the way to kill the Demo- .
cratic party." ;
His utterance provoked laughter. â¢
Baker attacked the Democratic party
and Judge Parker, its candidate last
year. He said the Republican party
was showing to-day the shrewdest poli
tics it ever showed. i";J
"It is," he said, amid a storm of Re
publican applause, "giving rope to the
Southern Democrats and they are
hanging themselves." j
He declared that the only reason that j
the Democrats were members of the >
party was because of the negro ques- 1
tion. Referring to Judge Parker. Bak- !
er spoke c-f him as having been foisted i
upon the party by men like those who .
supported this subsidy. ]
Baker said that Thomas F. Ryan !
went into the Southern States and told i
the Democrats that Bryan had prevent- j
v ed the Democratic party winning for j
eight years, saying: - â¢ :
"Come with us and we will deliver j
the goods."
Other monopolists of the Democratic
party sang the same sing-song, and the â¢
Southern. Democrats listened and be
came responsible for the results of the !
last election. '
"Do you mean to. denounce Judge!
Parker as a monopolist?" asked Pou of |
North Carolina. -' - ' |
"I say," responded (â  Baker, "that j
* Judge Parker's candidacy was initiated
and manipulated by monopolists." j
On â  point of order, the provision of
$45,000 to be paid to the Oceanic Steam- :
ship Company for carrying mails to .
Tahiti was stricken out.
After a protracted debate an amend- ;
ment was agreed to allotting $45,000 out
- of the appropriation for transporting .
foreign mails, for carrying the mails
from San Francisco to Tahiti under
contract-
L nanimous consent was refused Wil
' Mississippi, the minority lead
withdraw the minority report on
:!1 to regulate freight rates, as
â wf ,1 as to amend the bill presented by
the minority in connection therewith
to declare private car lines and

PRISON GUARD
IS DISMISSED
Warden Yell Believes Cap
tain 31nrphy From Duty
at Folsom Penitentiary
NO CAUSE IS ASSIGNED
L'cjnoval Comes as a Great
Surprise to the Friends
of the Deposed Official
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 2.â After twen
ty-five years' 1 continuous duty 'â  at Ff/1
som Prison and 'â  just as he had : left a
sick bed, where ;. he had been : confined
from wounds received from the knives
of the desperate, convicts who recently
attempted to make . a break for liberty
and were shot down by ; Guard â¦Harris,
Captain R. â¢J. - Murphy has been dis
missed. . - ' .
1 It is said that his dismissal,' resulted
f rom ' an article ; printed .in the local
press, which reflected on Warden Yell.
It is now reported that Yell ; attributed
the article to Captain ; Murphy ' and for
that K reason dismissed, him. Yell ;. re
fuses to discuss the dismissal. , : â 
Captain Murphy has nothing to say
about ; the matter." '.f' He - says he . never
criticized the actions of his superior.
';â  â : '''â¦ * ":: â "â¢â  -' : '. ." . -'
KI.MOVAL CAUSES SUKIMtISIC
Warden Did Not Consult With the
Prison Commissioners.
The dismissal of Captain of the
Guards Murpny fri/m Folsom came so
suddenly that even the Board of Prison
Commissioners were surprised at the
action taken by Warden Yell. Commis
sioner Charles N. Felton said yesterday
that he had heard nothing about the
dismissal of Murphy until informed of
it by The Call. However, Warden Yell
is emot.-wered to dismiss whom he
pleases from the prison and make his
own appointments except in the case of
the commissary department, the mem
bers of which are selected by the Com
missioners. It is said on good author
ity that Lieutenant Cochran will suc
ceed Murphy.
It has been rumored for some time
that Warden "i ell was anxious to get
rid of Murphy. Although the latter had
been a faithful employe of the prison
for more than twenty years and knew
much about the handling of prisoners.
Yell feared that he was not strict
enough with the felons in the hour of
dang-r and was liable to injure the se
vere discipline installed by the new
Warden.
Many facts are cited in support of
this theory. When the first prison
break occurred in August, 1903, Murphy
was captured by the escaping convicts
and used by them as a shield. The
captain of thp guards at that time gave
the men under him orders not to shoot
at the runaway desperadoes. Conse
quently, it made it easy for them to
cany out their plans and resulted in
the shedding of much innocent blood.
Warden Yell was appointed to suc
ceed Warden Wilkinson, which oc
curred shortly after the first break at
the prison. Yell at once inaugurated a
strict code of discipline at the priscn
and gave each of the guards positive
orders to shoot any criminal who
made a break for liberty.
When the convicts made their secon I
attempt to break jail a few months
ago. Yell's orders were carried out and
the result was that an escape was pre
vented. Strange to say* Captain bf the
(Juards Murphy was again captured
and used as a shield and it is said he
again issued orders to the guards not to
shoot.
Murphy was wounded during the
fi?:ht that ensued, but recovered from
the shot he received. Since that time,
it is understood that Warden Yell was
quietly looking for a man to take Mur
phy's plai-e. That he had fully made
up his mind to dispense with the serv
kjea c-f the captain of the guards was
known by many. He did not consider
Murphy a stern enough, man for the
position and feared the convicts might
again take advantage of a chance and
attempt to break Jail <*nee more.
It is understood that the Board of
Prison Commissioners will uphold Yells
action. The board has full power to re
voke any appointment made by the
Warden providing that sufficient evi
dence is brought forth to show that his
judgment was faulty. It seems almost
a certainty that Lieutenant Cochran
will be appointed to fill the vacancy
caused by Murphy's discharge.
Cochran has been a guard at the
prisc-n for a number of years and is
known as a stern and fearless man.
Yell has often expressed his admiration
for the lieutenant, and as the latter
Is pext in line to the deposed captain,
he stands an excellent chance of se
curing the place.

Prussian Government Takes
Step That Shows It Will
Endeavor to End Strike
BERLIN, Feb. 2. â The Prussian Gov
ernment has inquired of the group of
financial interests represented by the
Eresdener Bank and the Bank for
Business and Industry if it would be
difficult to raise loans sufficient to take
over the coal mines both of the Rhen
ish-Westphalian and Silesian regions,
should the Government desire to con
sider a project. This inquiry was sub
mitted to a meeting of bankers last
week as a basis for discussion. The
â sum of $250,000,000 was named as *a
rough estimate of the cost.
The bankers' Judgment was that any
Government requirement could easily
be obtained. The Government, it waa
pointed out, had no difficulty in bor
rowing four times as much with which
to nationalize the r&ilways. In that
transaction the Government borrowed
a t 4 per cent, afterward converting the
transaction into a Zhb per cent loan,
.and it had besides the interest and al
lotments of the sinking fund, which
made a fine yearly profit, amounting
in the last fiscal year to $42,500,000.
The Ministry of Commerce express
ly limited its communicatio to the
banker? to the mere question of the
possibility of raising the amount of
money needed. The Government seem
ingly has two objects in view â first, to
(earn if the nationalization of the
mines is really feasible, and, second, to
show the mine owners what might
happen if the coal strike is not set
tlMi, namely, that the Government has
means in reserve whereby it could take
the whole controversy out of the hands
or" both the owners and workmen.
Chancellor yon Bulow and Herr
Mueller, Minister of Commerce and In
dustry, announced in the Prussian Diet
during the recent Hiberia mine dis
cussions that the Government had no
intention of taking over all the coal
mines, but since then the situation has
changed and the Government seeming
ly Is prepared tor what is yet only a
somewhat distant contingency.

ALAMEDA, Feb. 2.â Unconscious
and dying as a result of a hazing said
to have Toeen administered by boys
larger than himself at the Longfellow
public school, little Clarence Lubben
lies at the home of his father, John
Lubben, 630 Pacific avenue. He has
only a short time to live, the doctors
say. Since Sunday the child patient
has been in a comatose condition with
brain fever and in his delirium the suf
fering lad occasionally cries out the
names of boys supposed to have been
implicated in the rough treatment that
brought him to death's door. Twq
other cases of hazing, one at the Long
fellaw School aÂ«d one at the Mastick
School, where- the victim was forced
to eat matches, have come to light. It
is said that there are still other in
stances of cruel treatment prac
ticed by pupils which have resulted in
injury and sickness to the students tor
mented. Concerning his son's case
John Lubben said:
Clarence is my only child and from what
the physicians tell me I will be childless loon,
and all because of the brutality of boy pupils
at the Longfellow School who tossed Clarence
up in the air and permitted him to fall with
force upon his back and injure his spine in
such a manner that brain fever has developed
From what Clarence told me the boys who
tossed him were much larger than he was.
They caught him by the feet and arms and
threw him up as high as they could.
This happened at the noon recess Tuesday,
January 3, the day after the schools opened.
When Clarence came home he complained of
severe fcaln i n his head and told me that
he had fallen. He did not tell of how he
fell and I gave him some simple home rem
edies, expecting that he would be all right
the next day. He appeared to be somewhat
better on Wednesday and I sent him to school
In the afternoon. After attending school for
a few days he again complained of pains in
his head and spine and would linger in the
house. Twelve days ago he was forced to
take to his bed and then it was that I began
an investigation of how Clarence came to fall.
I learned from a son of Detective George
Brown that Clarence had been thrown into
the air" by other boys and when I asked ray
son whether this was true he said It was
and that he was afraid to tell me or to tell
Principal C. J. Phlllppl for fear that the
boys would call him a atool pigeon and whip
him.
I have the names of the boys that I be
lieve were implicated in the hazing of Clar
ence and will divulge them when the proper
time comes. I spoke to Principal Phillppi
at out the brutal affair and he said that he
thought the students had imbibed the hazing
spirit from what they learned of the methods
used at the universities. I mean to have this
hazing affair Investigated thoroughly, as it
Is a disgrace that such brutalities should
exist In the Alameda school department.
A Â«on of Mr. and Mrs. George Johnson, a
neighbor of ouri, was also hazed at the Long
fellow School about the same time that Clar
ence was. The Johnson child waa severely
hurt in the head by being thrown Into the
air and allowed to fall upon the ground. My
son has been unconscious since Sunday and
in his raving he mentions the names of boys
who I think and who others have told me
were responsible for hazing Clarence. The
doctors hold out practically no hope for the
recovery of my child.
A. M. Vivier, proprietor of the West
End Pharmacy, asserts that his 11
year-old son was forced by some of
his schoolmates, to chew matches at
the Mastick School ten days ago and
that when he reached some he was
taken with violent vomiting spells and
was seriously ill for four days.
School Superintendent F. T. Moore
said to-night:
I heard nothing of the alleged hazing of
th< Lubben boy until this evening. I now un
u>â¢tund that Principal Philippl had endeav
ored to discover the identity of the boys who
are said to have tossed the Lubben lad into
the air and allowed him to hit the ground
upon his head and back but had failed to
do so. From what I understand the injury
of the Lubben boy was sustained In a gamt>
and not as a result of what might be termed
hazing. The A'ivier boy's father spoke to me
about the match-eating matter, but I believe
that the boy placed the match or matches in
his mouth as a dare and not because he was
compelled to do It by other boys. Principal
Phillppi has made no report to me of the
Lubben matter and I never heard of the John
son case until to-night. As yet no complaint
or demand for an Investigation has been filed
with the Board of Education.
Union Votes Not to Strike.

SENATORS PROBE
McKOWEN STEAL
President Wheeler and J. J.
Herr Tell About the For
mer Secretary's Lootings
EXPERT IS CRITICIZED
Committee's Questions Show
That Members Object
to Lax Way of Auditing
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Feb. 2.
The ghost of the McKowen scandal
at the University of California walked
this afternoon, when a committee of
State Senators, appointed to investi
gate the affairs of the university, de
voted two hours to bringing forth as
much of the McKowen story as two
witnesses could relate. President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler and former Auditor
of the Regents J. J. Herr were the
witnesses 'examined.
A report that McKowen, now in
San Quentin, would he haled before
the committee and told to tell just
how he stole more than $50,000 of uni
versity money was declared by Senator
Carter, chairman of the investigating
committee, to be an "interesting but
not valuable piece of information."
The committeemen say they have
never had any intention of using Mc-
McKowen as a witness.
Senators Carter, Lukens, Selvage,
lieake and Sanlord compose the com
mittee. Senator Sanford alone of the
members was absent.
First of the party to arrive was the
Regents' former auditor, J. J. Herr,
who was relieved of his office soon
after McKowen's stealings were found
out. Herr has sought to prove that he
should not be blamed for McKowen's
defalcation, as McKowen's books could
not possibly be used as the source of
information of his peculations. Herr
says the finance committee of the re
gents should have known that Mc-
Kowen's books were not kept posted,
and that auditing them was, in con
sequence, impossible fer many months
in succession.
EXPERT QUESTIONED.
During the course of Herr's examina
tion questions were asked which ap
peared to show that some of the Sena
tors apparently believe that the very
books which Herr audited and pro
nounced "all right" were used by Re
gent Brittain to find out the exact
amount of McKowen's stealings. This
Herr says could not be.
President Wheeler was the first wit
ness. He told of having been informed,
the day before McKowen made his con
fession, that the secretary of the re
gents had given a check signed by Mrs.
Phoebe Hearst to a race track book
maker, to settle an obligation. He sent
for McKowen, and urged him to con
fess his wrongdoing, if he was guilty.
The president said:
I asked him finally whether he had taken
university funds, arid he said: "I have."
Then followed his Complete confession. Re
gent Brittain was sent for. with other re
gents, and Governor Pard-ee was Informed by
telegraph of the affair. Â£c authorized Mc-
Kowen's suspension, and Mr. Henderson was
given charge of McKowen's books. That is
all, except that McKowen's conviction in
court followed his confession, and that sub
pequent examination of his books revealed
that he had stolen more than $si>,ouo.
President Wheeler knew nothing of
the bookkeeping methods used by
McKowen. He said he was not an ac
countant. That branch of the univer
sity was not under his supervision.
"Couldn't you run both ends of the
university?"- asked Senator Selvage,
and President Wheeler merely snyled
in answer.
Former Auditor Herr, seated in the
rear, alone, followed President Wheeler.
He was asked a few preliminary ques
tions by Senator Selvage regarding his
connection with the university's work,
and replied that he had been auditor
for fifteen years.
LUKENS PROBES.
Herr was then taken in h^nd by Sen
ator Lukens and questioned regarding
McKowen's style of keeping books and
Herr's method of auditing them. Luk
ens asked questions apparently Intend
ed to show that Herr's work had con
sisted merely in certifying to the arith
metical correctness of McKowen's
books and papers, without going into
an adequate audit of the bookkeeper's
records. The examination ran thus:
"How often did you audit these books'"
asked Senator Lukens.
"Whenever McKowen notified me they were
He^ UP and rCaUy f Â° r auditin &-' replied
sometimes it was three months between
your auditing experience-Bometlmes six or
Lukens 1 "" 8 """^ Â° F 8ometlrnes ""Â«â " queried
"Yes."
Don t you call that a sort of touch-and
go system of auditing to usp In checking the
Luken* 4 a Kreat instltutlon " k <- this?" Ba jd
Herr made no reply other than to declare
that former Regent Halltday. who before hs
death in 1900 was chairman of the fln m
committee of the regents, had .uthorlzed him
toponduct the auditing in this manner
Knn Dld , >' 0 " e JÂ« r lnf omi the regents that Mc-
Kowen s books were not posted up as they
"No. Â»ir."
"Why did you not?"
"I did not consider It my duty. They Â«m-
Ployod McKowen and should have been ,im
posed to have knowledge of hi<* work "
Senator Lukens. in asking pointed
questions of Herr, became a bit em
phatic at times, and finally Senator
Selvage, evidently restive, interrupted
to suggest that Herr be allowed to ex
plain the bookkeeping and auditing
system in force when McKowen was
secretary, without cross-examination
by Senator Lukens.
The cross-examination seems to be
hostile, said Selvage, "and it is not
in order. The witness hasn't been di
rectly examined yet. Let him tell his
story, give us his account and then be
cross-examined."
Senator Lukens disclaimed any hos
tility, said there were no charges
against any one, that Herr was not
under Investigation, and that the rules
of a court could not be used.
STEALS NOT ENTERED.
Chairman Carter sustained Selvage's
point and Herr then told with much
technical detail why McKowen's books
could not have shown to any auditor
that stealing was being done The
substance of his theory was that Mc-
Kowen stole moneys which he never
put in any book, and so the stealing
could not be detected by an auditor
The peculations were of funds paid
him by Dr. d'Ancona of the Affiliated
Colleges in San Francisco and of do
nations, given into his keeping by those
who made the donations.
At the conclusion of his explanation
Senator Lukens asked Herr if he con
sidered his audit an adequate one and
Herr insisted that it had been all that
the regents ever expected him to make
He constantly quoted Former Regent
Halllday, now dead, as his authority

is considerable doubt whether the prop

them.

show donations, wouldn't they?" said
Senator Lukens.
"Yes." replied Herr.
"Then if you examined all the books,
including the minute book, and the
donations shown on the minutes did
not appear In the receipts admitted by
McKowen, how did you overlook the
discrepancy?"
Herr replied that Mr. Halliday. when
alive, had told him not to pay atten
tion to donations â that he (Halliday)
would look after them and see that
everything was all right.
Herr admitted that hi* last examina
tion of McKowen's books, before the
defalcation was discovered was made
about nine months before the secre
tary's confession of g"ui!t. He declared
that no blame could be attached to him
for such infrequent examinations as
the books were not posted and^ience
could not be audited.
The committee adjourned at 5 o'clock
to continue its work in the same room
at 10:30 o'clock to-morrow morning.

MANY BALLOTS
ARE IDENTIFIED
Colorado Voters Show Up
Alleged Handwriting Ex
perts Before Legislators
PEABODY LOSES GROUND
Markings Declared Fraudu
lent Readily Picked Out
by Men Who Made Them
DENVER, Feb. 2.â One of the mys
teries of the alleged ballot box stuffing
at the election last November was
cleared bj- a witness in the Peabody-
Adam 6 gubernatorial contest before the
joint Legislative committee this aft
ernoon. The experts in a number of
precincts have declared a number of
ballots probably were illegal because
they were not creased in such a man
ner as was necessary for them to be
passed through the slot in the ballot
boxes. Alderman A. D. Maun" was
called by the Democratic attorney
simply to identify his ballot. He was
successful in this and on cross-exam
ination lie was asked to show how he
folded his ballot to put it through the
slot.
This brought cut the statement that
many of the ballots in that precinct
had never been in the ballot box. be
cause there was not room for them.
Instead, with the consent of the elec
tion officials and the Supreme Court
watchers, they were cast into the out
side case of the box and were not folded
in the Bame manner as those which
were put into the ballot box proper.
Most of the witnesses examined this
afternoon were foreign-born persons
residing in Klyria. a suburb of this city,
whose "ballots: had been declared by the
Pfabody experts to be fraudulent.
Ka<h witness was asked to write the
word "Democratic" as he had written
it on the ballot, and in each case the
handwriting was identical with that
on the ballot.
The ungealers of ballots reported on a
number of ballots which the experts
had testified were written by the same
hand. In one of the bunches of ballots
alleged to be in the same handwnting
were found those voted by John C.
Twombley, formerly Postmaster of
Denver, and Milton Aufanger. a Re
publican State Senator, and two mem
bers of his family.
SPOT ON SUN DISCOVERED
BY CHICAGO ASTRONOMER
It Is E*n- Shaped. 80.000 Miles Wide
and Near the Center of
the Luminary.
CHICAGO. Feb. 2.â A sun spot, be
lieved to be one of the largest and
best denned ever observed, has been
discovered by Professor A. H. Cole, a
local astronomer. Projected through
a small opera glass on a sheet of white
paper a disk measuring six inches in
diameter was disclosed. Mathematical
calculations proved that the spot on
the surface of the sun was one-tenth
of its, total diameter, or over 80,000
miles in its widest part.
The spot is egg-shaped and can be
easily discerned through a smoked
glass. It is situated east of the cen
tral portion of the sun and to-day
will be almost in the middle of the
luminary. The spot will be visible for
seven days. -V "-:f f 'â â  'â â - 1

WRITES LONG PROTEST
Episcopal Prelate Declares
That Catholic Schools Re
ceive More Than Fair Share
NEW YORK, Feb. 2.â The Evening
Post to-day prints a statement from
the Right Rev. William H. Hare, Prot
estant Episcopal missionary Bishop of
South Dakota, in which he charges that
the law prohibiting Government aid to
sectarian Indian schools has been evad
ed, and that money has been paid out
to the Catholic mission schools. Bishop
Hare says:
It was urged that when rations and an
nuities had reached the Indian country and a
parent who had a child in a mission boarding
school consented that that child's fair shar*
of the rations for his family should be turned
over to the said mission school, complianca
with his wish could not fairly be held to be
an " 'appropriation to a sectarian school." 1
ventured to present this view of the case to
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. He re
jetted it. I then carried the case to the
Secretary of the Interior. He upheld the de
ciston of thp commissioner. I then took the
matter up to the President, who referred the
matter to Attorney General Knox.
The statement then quotes Attorney
General Knox's reply, upholding the
position of the Indian Commissioner,
and declaring that official lias no au
thority to grant Bishop Hare's appli
cation. Continuing the Bishop says:
This opinion was sent me by the President
as his answer to my appeal. This, of course,
flr.ally settled the case. What its effect on
il.Â» school work of other missionary societies
was I can only Imagine. In regurd to my
own boarding school work it made it neces
tary to give up entirely two of the mission
boarding schrwls, namely. St. Paul's, Tank
ton Agency, and St. John's. (Tieyenne River
Reserve. I was ultimately driven to sell St.
Paul's School for about half its value and
St. John's for about one-tenth its value.
Imagine my surprise, therefore, on discov
ering, last September, that the same executive
officers who had declared this to be the policy
of the Government and had administered the
policy with inexorable suddenness and severity,
had been making large contracts for the con
duct of mission boarding schools.
On the sour of the moment it seemed to
me that I might ease my pecuniary' burdens
by securing such a contract for my mission
boarding schools and I wrote to W. A_ Jones.
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, asking for
Information. He replied:
"These contracts were entered into pursuant
to a petition filed In the HouÂ»e by the Indian*
of the several* reservations, the expense to be
paid out of trust funds now to their credit
in the treasury of the United States."
In answer to a second letter he wrote me:
"I do not think It Is necessary for you to
secure the consent or even to have a request
made for the tribe, for the purpose of enter-
Ing into a contract for your boarding school."
My eyes began to be opened: then I began
to ptare. I recalled the whole history of thÂ«
action of the Government in regard to the
Interdenominational schools as rehearsed
above. I wrote to three or four Protestant
missionary societies and learned that their
amazement was equal to my own. I next
discovered that these contracts numbered In
all nine and that eight had been made with
one denomination, and that of the total
amount of the contracts, viz. $102,780. all but
$4320 wa<6 for the benefit of one denomination.
Bishop Hare then appends a list of
contracts made by the United States
Indian Office with various sectarian or
ganizations for the education of Indian
children for the fiscal year ending June
30 next. The list follows:
St. Joseph's School, Roman Catholic, total
for year, $18,860; St. Louis School, Roman
Catholic, $tÂ«75: St. John's School, Roman
Catholic, $8125; Immaculate Conception School.
Roman Catholic, $7020: Holy Rosary School.
Roman Catholic. $27,600; St. Francis School,
Roman Catholic, $27,000; St Labres School,
Roman Catholic, $6480; St. Mary's School.
Roman Catholic, $500: Foss Boarding Bchool,
Lutheran, $4320; total, $102,780.

LIVES ON NUTS AND FRUIT
AND DRINKS NO WATER
New Yorker Says Dieting Would Pro-
duce a Race of Men Thirty
Feet Tall.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2. â Emile E. La
croix, who lectured on "Diet in Its Re
lation to Health" here to-night, de
clared he had not drunk water nor
any other liquid in five years. For
eighi years he has lived on nuts and
fruits only.
"I don't need water," he said. "I
don't crave it. I eat fruits and they
quench my thirst. Only once or twice
have I drunk water in years. Then I
was warm and I was working so hard
my heart became dry and the dryness
ascended to my throat. And, besides,
it is not meant that man should drink.
"Man was once, and could be again,
twenty or thirty feet tall. He was
strong, healthy and never wore cloth
ing. He ate proper food, grain and
nuts, and he was not vicious."

NOT A FRIEND
OF POLYGAMY
So Declares Mormon Digni
tary Quoted as Defending
Plural Marriage System
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 2.â J. G.
Kimball, general secretary and member
of the first council of the "seventy" of
the Mormon church, who was credited
in a special dispatch from Logan to the
Salt Lake Tribune on Sunday last with
having defended polygamy and de
clared before the Cache Stake confer
ence that Congress would be unable to
stop the practice, to-day issued a
signed statement in which he declared
that the report attributing to him any
defense of the practice of polygamy is
false. He asserts that he made no ref
erence to the subject of polygamy,
either openly or covertly, by inference
or innuendo. What he did say, he claims.
was to refer in the following language
to resolutions recently adopted by a
body of women in the Bast:
"Women in the East want Congress
to stop this thing (bringing children
into poor families). Congress will have
a rough time In trying to prevent poor
people having large numbers of chil
dren. These women want to put this
practice down and legalize race sui
cide."
Continuing Kimball said: "I then bore
my testimony that Mormonism is true,
that it had found its way into my
bones and into my blood, and that I
felt it in every fiber of my being, and
that 'Mormonism cannot be destroyed,
and the more they try to destroy it the
more it will grow. I believe in it and 1
will live it.' "

DUKE INSANE,
SAY DOCTORS
Physicians Make Affidavit
That Millionaire Was De
ranged When in Hospital
NEW YORK, Feb. 2.â Argument
upon the application of B. Lawrence
Duke, son of Brodie L. Duke, of Dur
ham, N. C, for the appointment of a
commission to inquire into the mentai
condition of his father, was heard to
day by Justice Leventrltt in the Su
preme Court.
In support of the application, Delan
cey Nicoll presented affidavits of two
physicians who examined Duke while
he was confined in Bellevue Hospital
and at a Long Island sanitarium. Nic
oll declared that Duke was insane and
that he was an habitual drunkard.
The motion was opposed by Lawyer
Louis S. Phillips, who represents Duke,
and who maintained that his client is
perfectly sane and that the allegations
in his son's petition are untrue.
Henry W. Younger, counsel for Mrs.
Alice L. Webb-Duke, whom Duke mar
ried last December, also appeared to
oppose the motion.
During his argument in opposition to
appointing a commission, Lawyer Phil
lips presented an affidavit from Duke
which began:
"I do not think I am a drinking
man."
Nicoll objected to the presentation
of the affidavit, claiming that it was
from an alleged incompetent and could
not be entertained. Justice Leventritt
adjourned the hearing until he could
decide the admissibility of the affida
vit.

THE RHODIAN SCHOLARS
WHEN Cecil Rhodes made his will, endowing scholarships in I
Â»rd for Americans and British colonists, he had in view
the intellectual training, under common influences, of mem-
I of the same race from parts of the world widely apart. This
was to the end that there might be created a common racial intelli
gence and purpose. He also desired that through the scholarship
acquired at one center the spirit of original research might be stim
ulated and science might get recruits from many nations, all acting
under the same inspiration. His purpose was patriotic and more
than patriotic. In some of its leadings it intimately concerned the
ice and progress of the world as these might be affected by com
:ty of purpose in essentials by the United States and Great
Britain.
The opportunity he offered was taken advantage of in this !
country, and the first quota of American students went over and
matriculated in the ancient university. The first report of their
progress at that seat of learning comes now in the form of a letter
from the California Rhodian to President Wheeler of the Berkeley
:ty. Those who have followed the development of the purpose
Cecil Rhodes expect that this report will deal with the intellectual
training, the lectures and the lecturers, the laboratories and the li
braries, the competition for the first honors in scholarship, and the
osphere of learning and of letters, in the institution. American
professors and students expect to hear from these incipient Oxons
about methods, organization of classes, hours of study, the rigor of
examinations, and especially of the differences in method of im
parting knowledge, between the English and American universities.
The letter of our own Rhodian is published and these expectant and
interested Americans can resort to it for the information they seek.
published this report says: "The Rhodes scholars are all
-.g well. Schtitt, from Cornell, made first in the mile and a half,
he freshman sports, and Young first in the 120-yard hurdles and
h jump, and myself in the broad jump at 18 feet 6 inches. Porter
lame took the hammer throw at 86 feet and the shot put at 31.
1 could have taken the hammer throw at 100 feet, but did not enter.
The captain of the football team is a Rhodes scholar. The most
interesting sport is rowing. I decided to take up one sport and do
my best at it. Every night I took a boat and practiced alone. Most
: .ents that had any ambition were trying for stroke. I tried also
and was gratified by becoming a stroke for four. Our four won
ihe heat. The following day we rowed the finals. Xo. 3 in my boat al
most fainted from cramps in the stomach. Besides a silver oar, which
every member of the crew gets, I got a silver challenge cup a foot
antl a half high, on which are engraved the names of the strokes for
many years back. Since the races in the fours we have been tried
out in the college eights, and before last term closed I was made
srroke over last year's stroke and many upper class men of the first
Trinity crew."
That is the Rhodian report as published. As far as it goes it is
gratifying: and flatters the learned Oxford professors in football, shot
putting, boating, hammer throwing, high jumping, broad jumping
and foot racing. Those learned teachers are no doubt finding good
material in the Rhodians. The man who can make a broad jump of
18 feet reflects credit upon the scholarship of old Oxford. But, the
Mion will be asked why not keep all of this latent talent at home
and train it here and gild with glory the domes of our American uni
versities? Why send our able high jumpers and broad jumpers,
â¢ racers, strokes and shot putters to make an Oxford holiday and
aten a foreign university? Shall our American colleges content
mselves with the humdrum of mathematics, physics, law, letters
tad divinity, and let Oxford skim the cream off our scholastic pan
and leave us the blue milk of mere knowledge?
It is evident that our American universities must wake up or
the Rhodes endowment will impoverish them of their valuable mate
rial. Why have Professor Morse Stephens go forth merely with his
lectures on history and Professor Plehn strive with economics and
the scientific intricacies of taxation, and Professor Hilgard wear
himself to a frazzle on sugar beets and ferments, and Professor Wick
instruct farmers how to make two blades of grass grow in place
Why all these vain things, added to such other vanities as
< ireek and Latin, the Semitic languages and Chinese, chemistry and
Professor Loeb's biology? What is the crossing of a starfish on a'â 
g compared to a broad jump of 18 feet?
The Legislature is in session and should proceed to reorganize
the State University, lest it become effete and obsolete, and the
irt of our Rhodians at Oxford crowd the Atlantic liners with
students inflamed with a desire to be stroke and put the shot and
acquire such essentials of an education as foot racing and the broad ,
jump. Let Professor Gay ley cease the writing of dramas and analy- â¢
â¢f the English classics and put his pen to a good college yell for '
the inspiration of the broad jumpers and strokes. Must we, in this
ng country, sit supinely and see ourselves outjumped at Oxford
by our own ungrateful sons, who go abroad for a consideration to
a their nimble heels on alien soil? Cecil Rhodes may have in-
tended his endowment to be the means of showing to us our schol
- Lie deficiencies in these respects. We are evidently in the rear
of the footrace and other studious occupations of that kind, and
.mi not too soon gird us for the proper use of the opportunities of
university training.
When a report comes from our Rhodians on sucn non-essentials
, as science and letters, we will bestow upon k the degree of inat
tention that such unimportant matters deserve.
THE producers of California have enough burdens to bear with
out putting more upon them to please the whims or prejudices of
others. A bill to imperil the producers has been introduced in
the Legislature making it a misdemeanor punishable by fine and im
prisonment for a producer to omit labeling his fruit boxes to show
the kind of labor that picked and packed the fruit. Of course this is
a phase of the perennial Chinese issue. It puts an appreciable expense
upon each box of fruit, for which the producer gets no return. It
puts his perishable property at the risk of being denied a landing on
any dock in the State, and of being left unloaded at any railway
station.
As The Call has recently said, the labor problem is about to
strike our fruit producers a hard blow, and the Legislature has no
right to add to its destructive force. The proposed law could not
Q be complied with anyway. The operations of picking and pack
ing fruit are emergent operations. Producers get any labor they
can hire. The fruit is often picked by Asiatic labor and packed by
white labor, when it can be found. The proposed law is grossly
discriminative. It is class legislation of the most offensive descrip
tion, and its operation would be oppressive of the most defenseless
class of producers, because their property is perishable. .
It is not the business of legislation to interfere with common law
rights nor to abridge the freedom of one class for the benefit of
another. The bill is pernicious and the producers of the State should
be heard in opposition to it.
The fortunes of California are embarked with her producers.
They are not asking the Legislature to fence them in with police
regulations, nor to penalize them, nor to expose their property to
destruction. They are not politicians, but they are citizens, and the
future of the State is involved in the right of freedom of action.
It looks like a situation which must be met with further use of military
force if England is to retain anything worth while as the final result of the
Young-husbend expedition. But will Great Britain light China for Tibetan
trade or Tibetan territory? Would English public sentiment support any
euch throwing of firebrands into the tinder box of an already difficult Eastern
situation? â Cleveland Leader.

for the lost time!"
The young man smiled amiably and
stepped into the hall.
"I will do my best," he said, "if
you will tell me where to begin."
He looked eagerly at the slim little
figure in the trim blue and white ging
ham gown and the big, enveloping
white apron, with the beruffled bib.
The delicately featured young face
was flushed with exertion, anxiety- â or
both.
"Oh, there is so much I hardly know
where to tell you to begin!" She
wrung her hands with a wild little ges
ture of bewilderment. "There's wood
and coal to be brought in first. And
that kitchen stove must be made to
burn. And you'll have to help me with
the dinner. I know," as he would
have spoken, "I didn't stipulate you'd
be obliged to do that sort of work
when I told them to send me a man
of all work, but -" breaking down
in helpless laughter, "if you're really
that you won't mmd â and I'll pay you
extra. Leave your hat and overcoat
here. You won't have time to get on
your working clothes." She glanced
at the heavy traveling bag he had set
down. "I'll give you one of Selma's
aprons when you get that fire started.
Oh, dear! That she should have left
at such a time! Come this way!"
She whisked away to the kitchen
regions, the newcomer striding after.
"Can you make that fire burn?" she
demanded desperately. She flung out
two little smudged and blackened
hands. "I've tried â till I've cried!"
"We'll have a dandy blaze here in
no time!" the man cried cheerily. He
had removed his coat and tied the big
blue apron around him. "I've made
lots of fires when I was camp â I mean
when I had to!" he ended lamely.
But Rita Carlton, energetically chop
ping savory herbs into the rolled
bread crumbs preparatory to stuffing
the big turkey on the kitchen table,
was paying slight attention to his
words. She did look up, however, to
smile approvingly, when presently a
roaring fire repaid the labor of her
assistant, and he came to her â tri
umphant, if disheveled, for further or
ders.
"I'm awfully sorry you have to work
In your best clothes, Peter!" she said
sweetly. "I believe Mr. Marsh said
your name was Peter. Next? Why, I
believe you'd better bring up the case
of Burgundy you'll find in the cellar.
It must be the right temperature, you
know!"
And when he had done so and gent
ly ranged the bottles sidelong at pre
cisely the proper distance from the
fire she looked at him curiously.
"You seem to understand about
wines," she remarked. "Perhaps you
have held the position of butler?" Â«
He was of military erectness and
held his head with the air of one who
cemmands rather than that of one
accustomed to accept orders.
"No, I've never been a butler!"" He
instantly repressed a quizzical smile.
"I know something about wines,
though. What shall Ido now?"
"Would you mind " She hesi
tated, regarding his white and shapely
hands. Perhaps he had been employed
in a store.
"I shall do anything you wish," he
assured her, hastily comprehending
the reason of her broken speech. "The
oysters? It is too soon to open those."
"Would you mmd â peeling the po
tatoes?" she asked timidly. The im
perious manner in which she had met
him was melting in the most miracu
lous fashion.

Then we must have a visitor. A gentle

glancing nervously at the clock, "if he

The mince pies were slipped into the

"Everything is going beautifully. I can

and she will attend â oh, here she is!"
The door opened to admit a brisk in

mained to be done.
"And you won't forget to open the
oysters, Peter," she cried, as she ran
up the back stairs. But when later she
descended to superintend the final de
tails of the dinner Peter had vanished.
"Gone!" she exclaimed, coming back
from the hall. "Gone â bag and bag

"Sure, they did send me up from the

she gasped.

THE GERMAN APPETITE
Wherever there is a German there
' you will find enough to eat. It may
not always be to your taste, but it is
there in wholesome quality and gen-
I erous quantity and usually his wife
j and children are also there to enjoy
iit with him. It is not unusual to see
the entire family, even down to the
! smallest child, at a festive gathering,
i and however queer this may appear to
j American eyes, it Is a custom of the
I fatherland, and a very commendable
I one. When the husband takes a glass
of wine or beer he is quite willing that
his wife should have an equal amount
and to give the baby a sip if it so
; pleases her. The entire code of ethics
in Germany is more on an equal plane
for men and women than in any other
| country in the world, and it is no
i doubt due to this phase of domestic
' felicity that Germany is practically a
divorceless country. At the annual
, Metzelsuppe the men do not come
alone, but bring their wives with
them. No man of any other national
ity in the world can boast the gastro
nomic capability of the German. The
number of glasses of beer that he can
consume with ease is something as
tonishing, and the mixture of soups,
sweet and sour, pickles, sausage and
cheeÃes dear to the Teutonic palate
are enough to give the ordinary mor
tal Indigestion by merely thinking of
them. â Harriet Quimby in Leslie's
Weekly.
A FINANCIAL FABLE
Once upon a Time, there was a
Financier who contrived to make the
others of his Ilk look like very little
Potatoes, indeed. He merrily trod the
Devious Ways of Frenzied Finance
with them and mixed and mingled in
their Nefarious Schemes till he had ac
quired his Full Quota of Opprobrium
and Scads. Then he suddenly re
formed, purchased an Interest in a
Magazine, and proceeded to expose his
erstwhile Associates, taking the Hide
off them without removing their
Clothing and almost making them like
it, and continuing until there was prac
tically nothing left for them but Fast
ing and Prayer; and he did it all so
Deftly, Scientifically and Well that he
not only made a large Fortune out of
it, but won the Absolution and Ap
plause of the Public, as well. Was he

plump, gracious, smiling, opened the
door to her expected guest. And rust
ling into the cozy parlor she presented
the handsome stranger in evening at
tire who followed her to the charming
young lady, who turned graciously from
the glowing hearth. "Rita, this is Dr.
Lawrence Tremaine, of whom â whyâ
what â "
"I have had the pleasure of meeting
Miss Carleton before â and have been
counting the moments till we met
again," Dr. Tremaine declared, bowing.
But Rita, standing motionless, stared
at him with great, shining eyes and
cheeks grown suddenly scarlet.
"Oh," she said in a horrified whisper,
"and I made you build the fire and peel
the potatoesâ"
"Rita!" shrieked Mrs. Miller. "Youâ
you never!"
"I did," she confessed desperately. "I
called him Peter!"
Tremaine, who had discovered a sub
urban hotel In which to make himself
presentable after his labors, laughed
joyously as a boy.
"It was no end of a lark," he declared
emphatically.
Then the host, appearing, was told
the story and Insisted on toasting the
new hired man when the Burgundy
came around.
"The most delightful dinner of my
life!" avowed Lawrence Tremaine when
he put Rita's opera cloak around her
after the play. "May I come to see you
on my way back Bast next week. Miss
Rita?"
Before the look he bent upon her the
girl's eyes drooped In sweet confusion.
"Yes â come," she said. â (Copyright,

SAILOR'S LIFE
IS CONSIDERED
Christian Endeavorers Tell
oi Work Being Done in
Behalf of Boys Afloat
The seafaring life was a theme of
especial interest at the eighteenth an
nual convention of the Golden Gate
Christian Endeavor Union, held at
the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church yesterday. The opening hymns
and the addresses dealt peculiarly with
the seaman's case. Brawny, stalwart
young Americans from warship and
training ship, leaders of the Christian
Endeavor movement on their respec
tive vessels, were present in an assem
blage that crowded the great rooms
of the church.
W. F. Ellis, vice president, presided
over the afternon meeting and J. W.
Hatch, president, occupied the chair at
th** great rally in the evening. "The
Floating Work" was one of the first
matters taken up and had among its
supporters F. W. Dorn, who spoke on
"The Work Among Men in the Navy."
Christian Endeavor societies, he show
ed, were in high favor and growing in
the United States navy.
The afternoon addresses were but a
prelude to the stirring and eloquent
message from Dr. George W. White,
who told of "The Church on the High
Seas," advocating that as there are
floating palaces and floating hotels and
floating homes of the sailor, so there
should, in his opinion, be floating
churches. He believed the opportunity
should be -given for religious service
on all vessels afloat.
As a result of an address by Miss
Jennie Partridge it was resolved that
Golden Gate Christian Endeavor Union
memoralize the Secretary of the Navy
that chaplains be appointed to all war
ships having a sufficient number of
men to warrant such action.
The Ladies' Seamen's Friends Society
was discussed by Mrs. A. Bradley and
the meeting resolved to send the fol
lowing to the Supervisors:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors ot
the City and County of San Francisco â Gentle
men : At a convention of the Golden Gate
Union of Christian Endeavor on February 2,
IS*XJ, a resolution was passed indorsing; the
petition of tbe Ladles' Seamen's Friends So
ciety for the lease of the Sailors' Home for
a term ot years and requesting that your
honorable body grant said lease to the said
society.
The following officers were installed
by the Rev. William Kirk Guthrie: J.
W. Hatch, president; H. L. Miser, first
vice president; Miss Agnes Schu
macher, second vice president; Miss R.
H. Tread well, recording secretary;
Mips Ida M. Stanford, corresponding
secretary; Dr. W. F. Crawford, treas
urer; Miss Rose E. Lamont, superin
tendent of intermediate work; Miss
Mcnte. V. Webb, superintendent of
junior work.
BREXNAN SHOWS TRANSFER
OF FATILER GREY'S MONEY
Doctor Prodnees Witnesses Who Heard
Priest Say That He Had Given
Away Fortune.
There was more evidence in Judge
Sloss' court yesterday in favor of the
contention of Dr. James F. Brennan
that the 532,000 which Father JP. J.
Grey now seeks to recover was given
to him by the aged priest while it was
yet in litigation. Most important was
the original assessment by which Grey
transferred to Brennan all the money
to his credit in the Hibernia Savings
and Loan Society, including a Judg
ment for $20,386 39. The assignment
was dated September 18, 1899, and was
acknowledged before Notary R. W.
Putnam, who testified to the authen
ticity of Grey's signature.
Dr. William Norris testified he had
heard Father Grey say that he had
given all of his property to Dr. Bren
nan. Like testimony was given by
Mrs. Catherine E. Houlehan.

Foe of California Apple Is Doomed
George Compere, just from Europe,
the discoverer of the parasite that kills
the dreaded codlln moth, declared yes
terday, while inspecting the work of
the parasite at the rooms of the State
Board of Horticulture, that in three
years, and probably less, the codlln
moth will have been practically de
stroyed in California. Nature prevents
the extermination of a type. The cod
lin moth will still remain, but only In
numbers sufficient to feed and keep !
alive its active and deadly enemy.
The ravages of the codlin moth In j
the United States, according to the De
partment of Agriculture, cost the ap- j
pie growers $11, 000,000 annually. The ;
loss on the apple crop of California 1
from ihis cause is fully 50 per cent of '
the whole each year. Consequently the
strong affirmation of Compere on this '
subject has great interest.
Compere has circled the world in his I
search of beneficial parasites half a i
dozen times or more. Bronzed by the |
sun of ardent climates and by the !
winds of the seas until he is as
dark as an Indian. Compere appeared
yesterday to be the typical liver of an
out-of-door existence.
"The parasite of the codlin moth,"
he said, "I discovered in Spain. It
also exists in France. In these two
countries it successfully controls the
codlin moth so that the percentage of
loss to the apple growlers by reason of
its depredations is very small. In ev
ery orchard in Spain and France where
the codlin moth exists the parasite Is
giving continual proof of its efficiency
as a destroyer. Nature uses its own
methods to destroy. By the way, it
is an interesting fact that there is no ''
instance on record where an Insect pest ,
has been permanently and successfully
checked by any artificial method.
"How do I know that the parasite
will be as efficient here as it is in Eu
rope? That is easy. L,ook at this jar.
Here 5s the codlin moth worm: here
is the parasite stabbing him to death.
In the last minute at least five of the
worms have been killed by the para- |
fcites while I have been watching. The
climatic conditions of California so
closely resemble those of Spain and
France as to be almost identical. Un
doubtedly the parasites will thrive in j
any temperature where apples ripen."
Then Mr. Compere talked about the
demonstration of the utility of the ben
eficial ineects in exterminating insect !
jifcsts already afforded bj- experiments
in California. Parasites imported have
brought under control the cottony
cushion scale that once threatened to
destroy all the citrus tree fruit south â¢
of Tehachapi; the soft brown scale, an
ether enemy of the citrus fruits; the
yellow scale, also a citrus fruit enemy:
the so-called San Jose scale, that at- *
tacked deciduous fruits; the black !
scale, the brown apricot scale and the
Plusia Brassica, or cabbage moth. On
his present trip Mr. Compere also
brought with him from abroad the
Pleril Rapae, which destroys the cab- i
bage worm.
While Compere talked the codlin i
moth parasite In multitudes displayed
its uncommon agility and rapacity in
a score or so of glass jars that stood
in the rooms. With lightning-like
speed the parasite plunged its rapier I
again and again through the bark of j
the prepared tree limbs, which, with

ENTOMOLOGIST WHO BROUGHT
FROM EUROPE PARASITE THAT
DESTROYS THE CODLIN MOTH.
perforated bark, shield from view and
giv# the codlin moth worm chance to
ppin cocoons. At each onslaught of
the parasite a codlin moth died and
the eggs of the parasite were de
posited.
"The work has actually begun in the
orchards," said Compere, "as already
reported in The Call. "Never again
will California be without the codlin
moth parasites. The breeding will be
very rapid. To stop the work of the
parasite would no more be possible
now than it would be to sweep back
the broad Pacific with a broom. The
parasite has come to stay and will
multiply to millions. Of all predatory
insects that destroy fruit, the most
generally distributed is the codlin
moth. It is in Europe, all over" the
United States and in Australia.
"Its doom in California is sealed.
What other States and other countries
will do remains to be seen.'
The name of the codlin moth para
site is Kphialtes Carbonarius. Even
with this name it is by all odds the
liveliest fly ever ?een in California.

DELMAS ROUSES
FEMININE IRE
Dissatisfied Daughteis of
J. Alexander Yoell Are
Indignant at Attorney
EXPERT GIVES OPINION
Dr. J. W. Robertson Declares
That the Aged Pioneer
Was Not of Sound Mind
The urbanity of Attorney D. M.
Delmas received a severe test in Judge
Kerrigan's court yesterday. The mo
ment the hearing of the Toell caaÂ«
was adjourned Belmas was surround
ed by indignant women, who over
whelmed him with reproaches.
The angry women were Mrs. Emily
Dunn, Mrs. Theobald and Miss Ger
trude Yoelh the dissatisfied daughters
of J. Alexander Yoell, whose will is
being contested.
Assailed on all sides by reproachful
words and indignant language, Delmas
appeared helpless. "May I ask. Mr.
Rix," he appealed to one of the at
torneys for the contestants, "to be re
lieved from this annoyance."
Rix remonstrated with his angry
clients, while the clerk rapped for or
der. With some difficulty the sisters
were persuaded to cease and Delmas
left the courtroom, followed by their
indignant glances.
The scene was caused by Mrs.
Dunn's inability to comprehend a
question propounded to her by Del
mas. She testified that she was forced
to sell a house given to her by her
father in order to pay bills for medi
cal service. The question was ex
plained by Delmas, by Attorney Hoefi
ler and by the court, but the witness
could not comprehend.
"That will do," said Delmas, with
a smile. The smile and a tittering in
the courtroom evidently nettled Mrs.
Dunn and her sisters, for the three
women instantly surrounded the at
torney and reproached him volubly in
spite of continued cries for order.
Dr. J. W. Robertson of the Liver
more Sanitarium testified that he be
lieved Toell to have been insane and
classified his insanity as the dementia
of old age. He said that people af
flicted in this manner were able to
transact business not connected with
subjects regarding which they have
insane delusions. "Ail insane people
are not in asylums," added Dr. Rob
ertson.
In the cross-examination Delmas
closely questioned the expert as to the
meaning of an insane delusion. "Take
the case of a man who, after thirty
years of married life, is driven out of
his home. If he should upbraid an
old friend and then apologize to him
en the next day, would that be evi
dence of his insanity?"
"No," replied the expert.
The case will be resumed at 10:30
o'clock this morning.

HE IS INNOCENT
Oregonian .Declares That
He Has No Fear of Final
of the Fraud Cases
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.-Senator
John Mitchell of Oregon, who was in
dicted by the United States Grand
Jury at Portland yesterday for bribery
in connection with the land frauds in
vestigation, has made a statement in
which he says he welcomes the most
searching investigation of the charges
against him and asserts that only
"misconstrued innocent acts" and "un
warrantable inference" can connect
him with the land frauds. He further
says :
Of the final outcome I hayÂ» not the slightest
fear, but in the meantime I assert in the moat
positive manner that I never In my life had
any conversation with Frederick R. Kribs
whatever in reference to any lands or any
other business matter. I am very positive in
the statement that I never at any time or
any place received from him, Frederick R.
Krlbs, or from any other person for him. di
rectly or indirectly, any check or checks for
any amount whatever, either on a Roseburg
bank or any other bank. In consideration for
any services rendered or to be rendered by mÂ«
as Senator or otherwise or for any purpose
whatever.
I further assert that Frederick R. * Krlbs
never in hit life contracted with me for the
services of A. H. Tanner and myself, or agreed
with me to pay for services alleged to have
been rendered in part by me in appearing be
fore and persuading Blnger Hermann, Com
missioner of the General Land Office, to make
special or recommend the issue of any pat
ents; nor do I believe he ever made any such
contract with A. H. Twiner, for the reason
that by the articles of cur co-partnership it.
was expressly stipulated that I could not be in
any manner interested in. any department busi
ness. But as to what business matters Judge
Tanner may have had. If any, with Krlbs,
Judge Tanner can himself speak, as I have !
no knowledge of them whatever, or do I know
that there were any.

HANDBALL MEN
RESUME PLAY
Olympians Get Away With
Two Out of Four Games
on St. Ignatius Court
MATCHES ARE ONE-SIDED
Tournament Games Will Be
Continued Next Sunday
at the Winged "0V Home
The handball men had a chance to
gather in all the glory last rftght at tr
St. Ignatius gymnasium courts,
resentatives from the Olympic, Oc
dental and St. Ignatius clubs hooked up
in a tournament match for the Kenneth
Melrose cup. The winged *O" men
added two games to their credit while
the other two clubs got a game eacn.
The games while not close were wÂ«
played and were well applauded from
the spectators' gallery.
George Cunningham of the Olympic
Club and J. Collins of St. Ignatius
gymnasium ushered in the evening s
sport. Cunningham got away with hts
game by a Score of 51 to 37. He was
too many for Collins and the result
never seemed the least doubtful. Col
lins played a good uphill game, but the
winged # O" man had him going all the
time.
George James. Olympic Club, and Al
Wilgus, St. Ignatius gymnasium, were
trotted out as the next brace of con
testants. James' all around superiority
was evident ere the game was many
minutes old. He beat Wilgus, 51-34.
The latter was there with some clever
kills and James waa mystified when he
went against some of them, but he
finally learned his opponents style and
drew out in front.
T. Leach, St. Ignatius, stowed T. Ma
honey, Occidental, away by a score of
61 to 34 in the third match of the even
ing. Leach took his lead and held it
throughout. Both men played and were
out to win. Joe Condon. Occidental,
got the decision over C. Cashman. St.
Ignatius, in the windup bout of the
night. Cashman never had a chance,
but he was game and played all the
time. The score was 51 to 17. Louis
Levy refereed the games.
The tournament will close in about
two weeks. The winged "O" represen
tatives have a lead up to the present
time, but the Occidental players are
coming on rapidly. St. Ignatius seems
out of the going as far as the trophy
figures, but the boys are playing for
the good of the game and are liable
to upset either of the opposing teams
at any moment. Several clever young
players represent the gymnasium and
are showing improved form with each
game they play.
Four more contests will be played on
the Olympic Club courts on Sunday
afternoon. H. Cory of the Olympic
Club meets A. Wilgus of St. Ignatius,
George Cunningham of the Olympic
Club meets J. X, Skelly of the Occi
dental Club. George James of the
Olympic Club meets A. Leach of St.
Ignatius and Louis Levy of the Olym
pic Club meets Joe Condon of the Oc
cidental Club.
MARE ISLAND ARCHITECT
DIVORCES LOVELESS WIFE
Show* Her Farewell Letter and Says
Her Mother Wishes Her to
Marry Wealthier Man.
Upon the ground of desertion
John W. Oliver, an architect at the
Mare Island navy yard, obtained a di
vorce from his wife Florence yester
day in Judge Graham's court. A let
ter from Mrs. Oliver to her husband,
written from this city in October,
1903, was sufficient evidence of her
intention to leave him. She asked him
to send her no more money, declaring
her intention to follow "her life
work." and saying that she had made
a mistake in marrying him. Oliver
testified that his wife had been di
vorced before he married her. and
that her mother now wants her to
marry a wealthy physician of San
Francisco.
It took Judge Seawell only three
minutes to hear the evidence and
grant a decree in the case of Marie A.
Gwynn from Charles A. Gwynn, who
deserted her two years ago. By agree
ment she was awarded $50 a month
for the support of herself and $25 for
her two-year-old child. Other di
vorces were granted by Judge Heb
bard to Mary Vazio from Pietro Vazio.
neglect; to Annie Mould from John T.
Mould, desertion.
Mary C. Bowers, who married John
P. Bowers, a saloon proprietor, on July
14, 1903, yesterday sued him for $100 a
month separate maintenance and $500
attorney's fees. She charges him with
desertion and says his business is
worth $10,000 and provides an income
of $1500 a month. Suit for divorce
was filed by Frank E. Gold against
Nora J. Gold, who, he says, has tried
to kill him with a razor, pistol and
butcher knife; by Jerry B. Lambkins
against Mabel A. Lambkins for deser
tion; by Robert Fisk against Lillian
Fisk, desertion; by Annie S. Larson

HARRY A. BUCK GETS
MUCH OOVETEÂ© PLACE
Denver and Rio Grande Man Is Made
General Agent of thÂ« Penn
sylvania Lines.
Harry A. Buck, distrlot passenger
agent of the Denver and Rio Grande
Railroad, was the recipient of many
congratulations yesterday whÂ«a the
announcement was formally mada of
his appointment to the newly created
position of general agent of the pas
senger department of the Pennsylva
nia lines. An order to that effect was
issued early in the day by E. A. Ford,
passenger traffic manager of the big
Eastern system, who came West to
make his selection of a suitabl* man
for the important place.
A week ago Ford addressed letters
to a number of the local general
agents, asking them to suggest men
whom they regarded as eligible for
the position. Soon he was besiege-i
with applications for appointment. At
least thirty well known railroad men
were personally interviewed by Ford
before he decided on Buck. Although
there was much disappointment fol
lowing the announcement of Buck's
appointment yesterday, there was
nevertheless general satisfaction ex
pressed over the fact that a California
man had been chosen.
Harry Buck is one of thÂ« best
known traffic men on the coast, where
he has been engaged in the railroad
business for nearly fifteen years. He
was formerly employed by the South
ern Pacific Company In Southern Cal
ifornia. Ten years ago he went to the
Denver and Rio Grande under Gen
eral Agent Snedaker. His ability was
recognized and he was favored with
several advancements, the last being
to the position of district passenger
agent, about ten years ago. His ap
pointment took effect yesterday and
was followed by the announcement
that L. A. Hagy, soliciting agent of
the Pennsylvania lines, would hereaf
ter fill the position of city passenger
agent. E, M. Pomeroy, Pacific Coast
freight agent of the Pennsylvania
lines, who has heretofore also had
charge of the passenger business of
the road, will hereafter devote his at
tention exclusively to freight matters.

Schussler Narrates Trials
of His Company in the
3latter of Kates Prescribed
Assistant City and County Attorney
Jo-hn C. Partridge continued his cross
examination of Hermann Schussler
yesterday before United States Com
missioner Heacock, in the matter of the
suit of the Spring Valley Water Works
against the city and county. The
CaFaveras dam site was a prominent
subject of the day's session. Mr.
Schussler said the site was purchased
in 1875 for 51,000,000. No attempt was
made to utilize its water until 1888,
when a drought was apprehended.
"Can you predict a drought?" in
quired Mr. Partridge dryly.
"No, sir," was the reply, "only God
Almighty can do that. We simply
judge c-f the future by the records of
the oast."
Mr. Schussler then said that the work
erf building the Calaveras dam required
much money, in fact, more than the
company felt that it could spare owing
to the uncertainty of the failure or suc
cess of legislation hostile to it. Under
the new constitution, he. said, boards of
supervisors began to reduce the income
of the company year by year, so thai
the large funds required for improve
ments were not always on hand. It
was in 1886 or 1887 before the company
was forced to risk spending the money.
There has always been a disposition,
he said, for the city to cut down the
rates charged the people for water.
"Notwithstanding tfiese cuttings
down," asked Mr. Partridge, "you were
able to pay the taxes, running ex
penses, improvements and still pay
dividends to your stockholders from
1879 tolS88?"
Mr. Schussler explained that there
were times when it was necessary to
stop payment o-f dividends. Though the
rates fixed by the board In those years
were perhaps sufficient to pay the run
ning expenses of the works they were
based upon the amount of money ex
pended by the company and not upon
the value of the works. Upon this lat
ter valuation â the present value of the
company's property â the rates fixed
would not enable the company to pay
dividends, he added.
Jurors Inspect Theaters.
Several members of the Grand Jury
inspected theaters yesterday after
noon. They were accompanied by
Commissioners Aigeltinger and Egan
of the Board of Public Works. Only
one showhouse was found to have
complied with the flre ordinances in
every detail. This evening the Grand
Jury will resume investigation of the
matter of the Continental Building
and Loan Association.

TRADES COUNCIL
AGAIN ENJOINED
Order Prevents Organiza
tion From Declaring That
Mantel Dealer Js Tnfair
Upon application of Bush Finnell. at
torney for the Citizens' Alliance, Judge
Seawell yesterday afternoon granted an
order prohibiting the Building Trades
Council from declaring Thomas F. Rig
ney unfair at its session last night.
Rigney, who is in the business of in
stalling mantels, tiles and grates, was
cited by the Building Trades Council
to appear last Tuesday night and show
why he should not be declared unfair
for refusing to meet the organization's
demands that he use wood mantels
made by a local concern instead of
buying them in the East. He paid no
attention to the summons and yester
day sued for a perpetual injunction to
prevent further interference with his
business or customers. He recites in the
complaint that it has been necessary
for him to purchase many of his sup
plies in the East. A few weeks ago he
closed a contract for installing thirty
five mantels for a contractor named
Meyers in a new building on Mission
street, near Fourteenth. The council's
representatives informed Meyers that
he would be boycotted if Rigney did the
work, and before the latter was permit
ted to proceed he was compelled to pay
a fine of $250 into the council's treasury.
Failure to obey a citation for appear
ance on Tuesday night is usually fol
lowed by action on Thursday night de
claring the offending party unfair,
hence Rigney's appeal to the courts.
Attorney Finnell also tiled a com
plaint for injunction for the Charles
Bliss Company against the Journey
men Tailors' Protective and Benevolent
Union, and the case has been assigned
to Judge Muraskys court. In Decem
ber the Bliss Company asked members
of the union if they would make a re
duction on bills for certain sack coats
which the company was then manufac
turing for sale. The union would not
grant the request, whereupon the com
pany declared that after January 1 it
would run an "open shop," but would
continue to pay its former wages to
good men. The union replied that such
a proceeding would cause trouble, and
on January 3 a strike and boycott were
declared. Since then, it is charged,
pickets numbering from two to twenty
have been stationed in front of the
place of business for the purpose of
frightening employes. Among the
words attributed to the union repre
sentatives are: "We will give you until
Saturday. February 4, and if you are
still in the employ of Bliss we will kill
every one of you."
Complains of New Light-*.
The Supervisors'. LAghl Committee
yesterday heard' a complaint against
thr> new electric light now being in
stalled in the place of the old Brush
lights. The committee held that the
complaint is not well founded, as at a
rt-cent investigation it found that the
new light was far superior to the old
one. It was said that dust accumu
lated in the globes and the committee
agreed to make another investigation.
STEALS CARPENTERS' TOOLS. â Samuel
D. Haynes was arreeted at a new building <->n
Hyde street, near Clay, on Wednesday night by
Policeman D. Hogan. Haynes wa# booked at
the City Prison on a charge of burglary. He
had a grain sack filled with carpenters" tools
at his? feet when discovered by the puliceman.
and In the toolhouse. the door of which had

GOULD RAILROAD
PRESIDENT HERE
Vf. A. Bradford Is Carefully
Examining the Affairs of
the Western Pacific Road
w. A. Bradford, president of the
Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville Rail
road, who was an important factor in
the project of the Goulds to get thetr
lines into Pittsburg. tias beÂ«n in San
Francisco for ten # days. President
Bradford was accompanied to this city
by H. L. Jackson, chief engineer of the
same road. Although they endeavored
to conceal the real purpose of their
visit to the coast it became known yes
terday that Bradford and Jackson have
been carefully looking over the terri
tory through which the Western Pacific-
Railroad is expected to extend.
The two railroad men were preceded
to San Francisco by Engineer BoguÂ»\
formerly of the Union Pacific, wh'
been engaged by the Goulds to inspect
the route of the Western Pacific. With
him Bradford and Jackson made a
journey up the Sacramento Valley,
quietly visiting different towns through
which the new line is projected. They
were accompanied on this trip and t
subsequent one around the bay by a
man who was for many years closely
allied with Huntingdon and Crocker in
their many local railroad schemes and
from him they gleaned much informa
tion regarding Northern California.
Bradford and Jackson left Bogue in th
north and returned to San Fran,
where they busied themselves for sev
eral days looking over maps and sur
veys in their rooms at the Palace.
It is understood that they were com
missioned by the Goulds and the !
YoTk financiers who are supposed to be
behind the Western Pacific Railroa.l
enterprise to inspect thoroughly
entire project, in so far as the
ptruction of the read is concerned,
that before coming to San Fran
th^y inspected a portion of the
templated route of the road in Nevada
and Utah with a view to making an â¢
extensive report cm their return to the
East.

WRITES LETTER
ABOUT TARIFF
Secretary Taft Explains
Why Philippine Products
Should Be Free From Duty
PLEADS FOX JUSTICE
Says Importations From the
Islands Can Have No Ap
preciable Effect on Markets
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.-Secretary
Taft has addressed to Chairman Payne
of the House Committee on Ways and
Means an exhaustive statement of the
motives which impel him to uree
earnestly on Congress the passage dur
ing the present session of the pending
Philippine tariff bill. The Secretary"s
reasons are in substance as follows:
Whatever ultimately will bÂ« done with the
Philippines, they are necessarily for the next
generation a part of the United States, and
there Is no mere reason for a tariff against
them than against Hawaii or Porto Rico or
our Territories, Under Spanish rule Philippine
sugar was given a preferential rate of 3 cents
per pound when imported into Spain, while the
Spanish Government took all its tobacco to
supply the government monopoily from Cuba
and the Philippines. Now Spain buys in the
cheapest market, and the Philippines have lost
the Spanish trade. The United States is under
obligation to make good this deficiency, which
has been made larger by the Increase of the
import tax on sugar and tobacco by Japan and
Australia, thus reducing the sales of the Phil
ippines commodities.
Unles3 the American tariff is reduced in favor
of the Philippines the law urging the islands'
trade with the United States to be carried
only In American bottoms will be a great bur
den and injustice to the Filipinos. Congress
should make good the heavy loss to the, islands'
revenues caused by the repeal, at the'dernand
of the American farmer, of the export tax on
hemp, a loss not made good by the return to
the islands of the import duty on hemp col
lected in the United States.
A total removal of duties on Philippine pro
ducts entering the United States is not asked
for at this time, though it will be in 1909,
when an internal revenue system applied to
the islands probably will develop enough
revenue to enable them to have free trade.
The .opposition to the reduction of the duties
ou sugar and tobacco has been nursed by paid
professional agents circulating: misleading and
unfounded statements, which has now de
veloped a decided opposition to the bill by
the representatives of all the sugar and to
bacco Interests of the country. The entire
present production of the Philippines would
not appreciably affect the American market
if admitted under the proposed rates.
The Philippines sugar land is limited; is
not as good as the Cuban land and the truth
is that the same land will produca hemp,
copra and rice much more profitably than
sugar, and so it Is the height of absurdity
to suppose that even with free tr de in sugar
with the United States there wi Id be any
considerable Increase in the Philippines sugar
product. No Philippines sugar or tobacco is
Imported to the United States and only wrap
pers and fillers, are ral*ed so there Is no
danger of competition with the American pro
duct. The total export of Philippines cigars
to all countries was only 1C5.C00.000. whereas
America produces 7,000.000,000 cigars, so that
the suggestion of competition is absurd. A
60 per cent reduction of the tariff rates would
not do the islands the slightest good, as has
been proved by experience with the 25 per cent
reduction.
The Secretary, in conclusion. Dleads
for justice for the Philippines.
SICK JURYMAN
DELAYS TRIAL
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Feb. 2.â The matter of se
lecting a Juror to fill the place of Jury
man Berry in the case of Adolph Web
er, accused of murdering his mother,
Mary Weber, was argued this morning
before Judge J. E. Prewett. By consent
of the attorneys interested it was de
cided to delay further action until Sat
urday. The court instructed the other
Jurors present that the case was post
poned until Monday morning, and or
dered them to appear at that time.
Judge Prewett then announced that
court would convene Saturday at 4 p.
m., at which time it is hoped there will
be definite information from Berry or
his physician as to Berry's ability to
be in attendance on Monday. If the in
formation is to the effect that Berry
will not be able to appear he will be
released from service as juryman on j
the ground of sickness. The court will
then issue a special venire, returnable :
on Monday. Under the ruling of the !
court both sides will commence the ex
amination of the new talesmen, with
the same number of peremptory chal- j
lenges as they had at the beginning of;
the trial.
C. H. Reimer, a detective engaged by
the prosecution, has made several trips
into the adjoining country and it is re
ported has secured important evidence
for the State.
The cost of conducting the trial was
the topic of general conversation
among the taxpayers to-day. Leading
citizens say It will run away up into
the thousands of dollars, and they are
wondering what the tax rate will be
next year. At present it is $1 95 per
$100, but they anticipate that next year
it will be greatly in excess of that rate.
DOLMETSCHES
DELIGHTING ALL
THE MUSICIANS
Fascinating as the first, the second
of the Dolmetsch concerts drew many
more people to Lyric Hall last night,
though there was still* much room.
Perhaps the most charming number
on the programme was a Sonataâ for
three instruments â by G. P. Teleman
(1740). It is throughout an exquisitely
graceful work, with an andante of
striking beauty. One remembers with
signal pleasure, too, the vinacious and
spirited finale. The sonata is for the
viola d'amour. viola da gamba and
harpsichord, and was played in ad
mirably sympathetic fashion by Mr.
Dolmetsch, Mrs. Dolmetsch and Miss
Kathleen Salmon. One noted anew
the altogether delightful values of the
harpsichord as accompaniment and
concert to the strings. It blends with
the string tone in a fashion that make?
one greatly regret its disuse, and to
hope that the rumor that the Stein
ways are persuading Mr. Dolmetsch to
superintend the making of some of the
instruments may be true. "We shall all
want one.
The programme throughout was
charming, and it is to be remembered
that there is another one to be heard
on Saturday afternoon.
Creatore and \Vngner.
Creatore and his band of Italian
musicians will give a German concert
to-night, the programme consisting of
j the works of Wagner. The interesting
j programme will include the "Tann
hauser" overture, the prelude to
"Lohengrin." scenes from "Parsifal,"
the stirring "Ride of the Valkyries"
' and other fine works. The ham solo
: Ist, Signor Sodera, will give some se
lections and Mme. Barili will sing.
The four final concerts of this splen
did organization will be given Saturday
and Sunday afternoons and evenings
and splendid programmes have been
arranged.

The Lumber Trade.
Pacific Coast 'Wood and Iron says of lumber
â *i January :
"TT.Â« lumber trade for January was quiet
and it was not until toward the end of the
month, that there irw a brightening up of
trade â¢ Th* raise of II on Douglas fir, mad*
January 1. has not affected sales in the least,
end. the market - could . earlly stand another
salvance If the ir.lllmen would hang together" â
and tiey must do so If they want their bal
&noea on the right fide of the ledger. . The
JPuget Bound nulls made but little, if any,
tnoaey last year, and if a throat-cutting policy
â¢JiouM be continued many a mill will close
â  cown. Pine men should profit by the experi
ence of the redwood men anU unite In demand
said secure a fair price Ear tfcelr output. .
"The redwood men are very hopeful. They
â¢re 'standing pax on list prices arid it looks
now as though they would have a prosperous
year. Some mills hf.Â»Â« a large surpioa, bat
this Is dally becoming more valuable as it
seasons ana It will soon be in good condition
for the Eastern market.
"The Eastern lumber papers are brooming
frightened tt thÂ« proposed 40c rats to the Mis
eouri. evidently feeling that Pacific Coast lum
ber may injure the white pine of the South.
We feel that there Is room, enough for ail the
lumber that can be made In the next fifty
years. â¢â â ."'
"It Is surprising the pi ogress that redwood
shingles are making In the Bast and It is very
gratifyt&g. Ties are scarce and in good de
mand. Altogether the year opens well for all
coast lumber men." ' '

York Stock Market.
NEW YORJtC. Feb. 2.â The speculative t*m
r- r on the ,Â£tpck'' Exchange 'changed to-day
fivm â¢.:â¢- hvtfvy' toruiJGi yesferfiay .and there
was .a resumption . of confidence in higher
Airicee. according to the evidence of the yre-
Uozpinaace of bu>-inir over selling in the mar;
Â«â .<â :. Dealings '-re of about the same di
xnetjsions as >Â«eterday and. were still obviousty
of a professional character to a large extent.
Very l&ree operations were easily - traceable
to t iic 'â  activity >: organized parties of pro
:â¢â¢(>;<..:.;-.! traders and their ' operatlon> were
lurpely concentrated In a few prominent
Bta cks. ! Specific news was not - assigned for
the- motive of the movement, general condi
ticryi being relied on to warrant the advance.
Regarded as a testing operation yesterday's
short sales and the slight effect which . they
produced ,ln driving down price* or bringing
out offerings of long stock were as Influential
Tat-tore in to-day's -market as anything else*
Attention waÂ» largely concentrated on Read
;rj.-. on which - the ".professional, operations
centered. The prosperous condition of the
emhracite -traffic resulting In a high rate of
earnings, with promise of the future growth
of dividend return on the stock were the un
derlying causes" for the . buying. - The spread
of the influence of the Reading movement was
rot rapid and some of the leading * stocks on
the list were sluggish and neglected through
a greater part of the day. The Southwestern
flocks did well, including the Wabashes. but
not Including Missouri Pacific, and the .spread
of the war for export grain as- between " the
Atlantic and the gulf . ports ' may have ' been
an influence on that' etpek. The Pacific?
cam* late into the movement In apite of
very moderate improvements "in . December
ret earnings disclosed by the Harriman lines,'
Southern Pacific actually falling below the
Drexnber level of , the preceding year. â¢ The
same was true of St. Paul. Pennsylvania* m
elrong showing of December earnings helped
the stock market In the early dealings, but it
came â  forward later. The placidity of the
money market drove thÂ« consideration of the
sold export movement into the background,
aUhough there Is every prospect of its definite
extension. All fhe great foreign banks pub
l'.Ehed their weekly reports to-day. The flow
of gold to Pans has resulted in only a email
Increase in the gold supply of the Bank ol
France for the week and that Institution is
making no effort at retrenchments notwith
standing the eager demand for gold in France.
*Tbe Bask of England showed a considerable
Increase In its proportion of reserves to lia
bllltlee, but discounts hardened In London
er.rt sterling exchange rose at Paris. There
was practically no yielding In the sterling
exchange rate In this market ' The slightly
irregular tone of stocks at the closing was
due to light profit-taking on the day's ad
vances.
Bonds were firm, Total sales. $9,876,000.
United States bonds were all - unchanged on

CUICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 2. â A decrease of receipts as !
a- result of extreme cold weather In the West
and -Northwest had a strengthening effect on !
the wheat market hero to-day. From' the start
these conditions had a restraining ' influence ,on i
sellers. In consequence, sentiment, was. not so j
bearish as might have been expected, consider- '
ing the weakness of the. Liverpool market.
May opened at $1 16, but prices made a gen
eral advance in response to a fair demand from '
pit traders . and - commission house*. - Advices
from the Northwest were of a bullish tenor, a
good demand â  for cash â¢ wheat : being, reported
from Minneapolis. â  Flour sales â at Minneapolis ;
were also said to show, a decided improvement.
A reduction in freight rates taking effect Feb
ruary 1 was given as one explanation for in
creased shipments of flour to-day in the North
west. The 1 wheat market as a result assumed
a stronger 1 tone as J the . session . progressed.
While there, was apparently some good selling
at times, the demand throughout the day was
of an ! Influential character, . offerings being
readily absorbed. For May the highest ' point !
of the session was reached at $1 17. The mar
ket closed almost at tha top, final quotations j
for May being at $1 10%. . . -
Corn prices also felt the stimulating Influence
of the severe cold weather. May closed at the
top.- 44% c
- ; Covering by : many traders who sold short
caused' firmness ' in the oats market. â ' May
closed up at 30% c. â¢ -' '
A much smaller increase In contract stocks
than had been expected . created some bullish
ness In the provisions market. At the close
May pork was up 7^4c, lard was a shade i
higher and ribs 'were up sc.
The leading futures ranged as follows: .

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The situation In Butter showed no material
change, stocks and quotations being about as
they have been for a week. Some houses con
tinue disposed to sell at concessions to keep
their floors cleared up. while others adhere
to previous prices. One house reported yester
day that it had been advised from the north
that Buttpr was coming In from Montana at
lower prices than it could be obtained from
San Francisco, hence no more Is wanted from
this market.
The feature in Eggs at the moment is the
firmness in store Eggs, which are selling at
25c in preference to ranch at 26(g)2ic. Other
wise there is nothing new in Eggs. The rain
has thus far produced no effect one way or
the other on the market.

CANNED SALMONâ The market on this
coast Is quiet, but the Liverpool market is
reported brisk, with some descriptions higher.
Reports show a large stock of Alaska In Eng
land, but as It Is well concentrated and none
of the 1906 pack can reach there before the
spring of 1906, the situation there is strong.
The K?lly-Clarke Company in its- review of
the salmon trade states that, whereas fifty
three canneries in Alaska packed 1,900 000
cases in 1904, only thirty-seven plants will op
erate this season, and only 1,200,000 cases are
expected.

OVER THE GATE
COMBAT WAGES
Mrs. Smith Avers Mr.
Davis Struck Her.
He Says She First Smote His
"Koko 1 With a Hammer.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Mr*. BridfTt Smith's allegation of
battery hinged upon the question of
Charles G. Davis' right to unhinge the
small gaje that, afforded sole means of
entrance to the house jointly occupied
by their respective families at 20 7
Eighth street. She desjred to have the
rate kept closed, but he said the task
Â©f opening and shutting it every time
any person came in or went ouv was a
"derned bore" and he for one would
rot be bothered with it- So each en
<- or exit of Mr. Davis was fol
l'-Â»wed by an exchange of unpleas
t-twepn himself and Mrs.
Smith, but not until he kicked the gate
â  H>?ture its fastening did
: hostflftfea begin. After she had
her opinion of Mr. Davis and
female relatives Mrs.
procured a hammer and nails
; :?d the damage? inflicted by
him. Then, she aver 6. he struck her,
but he re] i .he did not lay
hands upon her until after she had
violently tapped his head with the
hamr.
Among the witnesses who testified
before Police Judge Cabaniss in behalf
â¢â¢1 the t.rosocution was Mrs. Lizzie
of g Sunshine place, who swore
that she saw Mr. Davis strike Mrs.
Smith and continue striking her until
an unknown man restrained him. "If
Xikf Rogers, my roomer, wasn't sick

"Certainly," was Mrs. Morrissey's

Mrs. Flora Davis, wife of the de
fendant, told the magistrate that she
was called uncomplimentary names by
Mrs. Smith, who also persisted in
regulating the gate, contrary to the
expressed desire of the Davises. The
defendant himself pronounced Mrs.
Smith's language "something fierce,"

Oscar Ohlson. charged with having
neglected, his blind wife and six young
children, told Judge Mogan that his
weekly, earnings never exceeded $18, but
that he received a Stipend of $25 a week
from Whittier. Coburn & Co., by whom
he was employed- as a bookkeeper, was
proved by the firm's cashier. Then the
Judge told Mr. Ohlson that when he
comes up for sentence to-morrow .â  he
will ascertain that . the man who de
liberately shirks his family responsi
bilities and leaves an invalid wife and
helpless children to suffer while he
spends his earnings in dissipation must
be punished for it. Mrs. Ohlson is in a

As she approached Judge Mogan's
bench Miss Ida Smith chewed gum un
til her attorney covertly informed her
that the masticatory exercise was not
likely to help her defense. Then she re
moved a long string of the sticky stuff
from her mouth and with gloved fingers
rolled it into a tiny ball, which she was
apparently going to attach to the in
step of her left shoe when a restraining
nudge from the lawyer induced her to
abandon thai intention and utilize her
bracelet as a depository instead. And
when she held up her right hand to be
sworn the gum wad loomed conspicu
ously on the gilded wrist circlet.
Miss Smith was arrested between
midnight and 1 o'clock a. m. at Powell"
and Ellis streets, and the charge en
tered against her was that of disturb
ing the peace. Asked for particulars,
Patrolman Hanley testified â¢ that she
was "rounding." A request that he be
more explicit brought forth the infor
mation that she -shouted "Hi, kid" at
masculine pedestrians who had passed
by her, and when they ceased walking
and turned around in response to her
hall she, too, had turned around and ;
was laughing in her* sealskin sleeve. <
The pastime, popular in the tenderloin i
and commonly known as "rounding," ' ,
was extremely annoying to those vic
timized by it. although it furnished
amusement for its operator and the
spectators of the victim's discomfiture.
Then the defendant's attorney asked
for time to enable him to construct and
present a defense that would surely
annihilate the policeman's claim that
Miss Smith was "rounding." He (the
attorney) would not deny that "round
ing," which he considered a silly and
puerile amusement, had been indulged
in by some person or persons at the
time and tflace alleged, but he would
furnish abundant proof that his client
was not guilty of the offense. Miss
Smith's feather-clad hat bobbed ap
proval of every word her legal adviser
uttered, and she smiled gratefully and j
restored the gum to her facial orifice '
when the Judge continued the hearing i

WHIPS BRITISH
GLOBE-TROTTER
Paymaster Gudger of Ameri
can Navy Thrashes Fellow
Passenger on Liner Korea
PAYS FOR INTERFERING
Arthur Boyce of England Ec-
ceives Effective Lesson in
Manners on the High Seas
The calm of the Korea's otherwise
uneventful voyage from the Far East
was broken two nights before the voy
, aye ended by a midnight battle be
tween an American navy officer and a
British globe-trotter. The Stars and
Stripes triumphed, and yesterday, when
the liner was tied up alongside the
Pacific Mail wharf and the man from
England walked down the gang plank,
! his lower lip still wore the bruises
made by the knuckles of the southern
gentleman of whom he had run afoul.
Tuesday night was warm, calm and
fair at sea. The long voyage was
nearly ended and Paymaster Emmet C.
Gudger of the United States navy, on
his way hi/me from duty with the
Asiatic squadron, .paced the deck until
a late hour walking and talking as only
I a navy officer can with one of his fair
fellow passengers. From end to end of
the broad boat-deck they tramped. The
topics they discussed concern none but
themselves. That they were of absorb
ing interest is best evidenced by the
fact that midnight found them still
walking, still engaged in conversation.
As the liner's gongs sounded eight
bells, Arthur Boyce. a Briton, who has j
'â  been wandering over the earth after
the manner of his kind, stepped out of
the smoking room, filled his lungs with |
the refreshing ozone, and decided to i
take a turn or two on the boat-deck j
before turning in. He met the pay
master and the lady and insisted upon !
"butting in." Hints fell unheeded on
his ears. Gudger spoke plainly and the i
man from England passed an uncom- !
plimentary remark about the lady. Now !
Gudger is from North Carolina.
"I cannot reply to you in the presence i
of this lady, sir; but if you will wait I
here for a moment, I will return, and j
will settle this matter without delay i
sir."
So saying, Gudger gave the lady his
inn, escorted her to the music room i
and returned to the bridge deck. Boyce '
had vanished. Gudger proceeded to â 
Boyce's stateroom Â«nd invited Boyce ;
outside. Boyce accepted the Invitation ,
and on the bridge deck they had it out. i
Gudger is small, but willing. As his
Southern blood boiled he drove his fists
into the Briton's face, marking there his
disapproval of "butters in" and of un- ,
gallantry of speech in the presence of
the fair sex.
"I say, you blawsted little Yankee
Ore-eater, I'll apologize, you know," j
blurted Boyce during a breathing spell, i
With a punch in the jaw for calling
him a Yankee,- Gudger accepted the â 
Englishman's surrender and helped the
defeated enemy to his room, where he
left him.
With Gudger's disappearance Brjyce's j
courage returned. He went on deck,
aroused Chief Officer Lewis and insist
ed on seeing Captain Seabury. Captain
Seabury was asleep, but so insistent
were Boyce's demands that Lewis ;
awakened the commander, who made
an investigation of the affair.
"Go to bed, the pair of you." said '
Captain Seabury. "If there is any
more of this I'll take a hand in it my
self. Go to bed."
"He insulted a lady and I had to
thrash him," said Paymaster Gudger
yesterday.
"This is purely a personal matter and
I must decline to discuss it," said Ar- i
rhur Boyce, gently jabbing his bruised
Up with a cambric handkerchief.

FINN IS READY
TO BE SHIFTED
Supervisor to Be Made a
Fire Commissioner When
Successor Is Decided On
GOSSIP POINTS TO RUEF
Rumor Herbert Schmitz
Is Being Considered for
Vacancy on Police Board
Mayor Schmitz announced yesterday
that the proposed "shift" of city of
ficials is well under way and will be
accomplished to-day. Supervisor
Finn is ready at any moment to re
sign to accept the Fire Commissioner
ship made vacant by Boyne's transfer
to the secretaryship of the Police
Commission. The Mayor has not de
cided on Finn's successor as Super
visor, although he is anxious to name
Election Commissioner Devoto. The
charter provision prohibiting an Elec
tion Commissioner from accepting an
other office within a year after the
expiration of his term is causing the
Mayor some worry and he may select
another man for the place. It has
been suggested that Abe Ruef would
be just the man to champion the
Mayor's cause as against the Demo
cratic majority of the Board of Su
pervisors. The job is Ruef's if he
take it.
Should Devoto be appointed Super
visor it is said he will be succeeded
as Election Commissioner by Alexan
der O'Grady, who refused the Police
Board secretaryship. John G. Fitz
gerald is hopeful that he will be
named as storekeeper of the Board of
Education should De Succa accept the
secretaryship of the Board of Works.
Samuel Beckett, Assemblyman from
the Thirty-eighth District, also has
aspirations in that direction.
A rumor was current yesterday that
Herbert Schmitz is being favorably
considered by his brother for appoint
ment as Police Commissioner to suc
ceed H. W. Hutton. The original pro
gramme was to have Herbert Schmitz
take his old position as secretary of
the Park Commission to succeed De
Succa, who was to be made either
storekeeper of the Board of Education
or secretary of the Board of Works.
Schmitz does not relish the idea of
accepting a subordinate position and
it is predicted that he will be made
Police Commissioner. The Mayor has
said he would appoint a Democrat to
the place. He may change his mind
and appoint his brother.
Jeremiah A. Dineen, a contractor
and friend of the Mayor, was offered
the post. Up to a few days ago he
had declined the offer on the ground
of ill health and a disinclination to
be burdened with the onerous duties
of the position.
Civil Service Commissioner John
Rogers has decided to accompany
Congressman Hayes to Washington
and will resign his office in October.
The resignation will enable Mayor
Schmitz to appoint David J. Oliver Jr.
to the vacancy. The Mayor has for
a long while been desirous of appoint
ing Oliver to some commissionership.
As Congress will meet and adjourn oh
March 4, there will be no need for
Rogers in Washington until later in
tbe year unless the President calls an
extra session. In that event Rogers
would resign at once.
A BOTTLE HE VALUED.
A funny thing occurred on a Pullman
car the other night. A gentleman had
gone to bed in one of the lower berths
and thinking the upper berth would not
be occupied placed his valise there. As
the train filled up all the berths were
taken. It became necessary for the por
ter to remove his valise and place it on
the floor at the side of his berth. In do
ing so he let the valise down with a jar
that broke a bottle In it, the contents of
which ran out. "Golly," he cried, "I
have broken a bottle." "Broken a bot
tle!" came a roar from behind the cur
tains; "did you break a bottle In my va
lise?" "Guess I did, sir." "Do you know,
porter, you have put me to the bad?"
"Bottle of bourbon, sir?" "No, sir. it
was a bottle of Red Raven, the only
pleasant tasting aperient water. I was
to take it to-morrow before breakfast.
You can't get any substitute for Red
Raven. Nothing acts so gently on the
liver or is so good for a man after he has
spent a night on the cars. I would rather
have had you wreck the train than have
broken that bottle." "Do not get excited.

The coming of the noted New York
star, Paul Gilmore. to the California
Theater on Sunday night has awaken
ed widespread interest among local
theater-goers. This will be Gilmore's
first appearance in San Francisco, but
he will not come here a stranger to
those who keep well informed upon
theatrical doings, for his reputation
has preceded him by several years. The
Eastern magazines have been devot
ing considerable space to his achieve
ments on the stage, and to-day he is
locked upon as one of the best of the
group of rising young stars now be
fore the American public.
Three years ago Gilmore succeeded
Drew as the star in "The Tyranny of
Tears," touring the Eastern States
with much success. He then followed
Drew in 'The Mummy and the Hum
ming Bird," now being in his second
season with this widely discussed play.
The piece was originally written for
the celebrated English actor. Sir
Charles Wyndham. who enjoyed an
enormous success during a long run in
London. John Drew was the first to
produce 'The Mummy and the Hum
ming Bird" in America, and Gilmore
will be the first to present it to a San
Francisco audience.

AGED WOMAN BELIEVES SHE
IS ENTIRELY COMPETENT
Says Her Management of Business and
Disposal of Money Is No Con
cern of Children.
Madelina Cresta, confessing to 62
years, while her daughters aver she is
76, declared in Judge Coffey's court
yesterday that she was entirely capable
of managing her own affairs and that j
the way in which she spent her money ;
was "nobody's business." Her son,
Frank Cre9ta, has applied for letters of
guardianship over the old lady and
he is backed by four of the five sisters, j
three of whom were in court yesterday
to give evidence substantiating the ;
charge that the mother was under the
control of her son Joe, a well-known
member of the Italian colony, who,
they say, is using her income for drink
and gambling.
Mrs. Cresta has a life interest in j
four pieces of property at Green and I
Montgomery streets and on Vallejo f
street, near Kearny, and she admits
receiving $250 a month from her ten
ants. The daughters say the Income is '
$350 and that their mother is letting \
the property go to ruin rather than
make repairs. They also say she [
drinks a great deal. She said she had '
given Joe money when he needed it, ,
but that he was at work now and ,
needed none. However, her bank ac- I
count is in his name. The sisters were
bitter against mother and brother. At
torney Abe Ruef asked one of them i
what the brother did. She replied, '
"Oh, he steals from my mother." The â 
hearing will be resumed this after-

Started. Malicious Litigation.
Judge Seawell yesterday devoted
another afternoon to neariiig evidence*
on the application of the "powder
trust" for a writ of mandate permit
ting it to inspect the books of the Pey
ton Chemical Company. Garret W.
McEnerney, representing the Dv Pont
Company, continued his examinal*on
of President W. C. Peyton and Secre
tary J. P. Wallace of the local con
cern as to their reasons for refusing R.
S. Penniman permission to inspect the
books and for de< lining to transfer
stock to him upon order of the Dv
Pont Company. Mr. McEnerney of
fered in evidence correspondence be
tween Peyton and Vice President A. J.
Moxham of the Dv Pont Company,
wherein the latter declined to buy out
Peyton's interest, but offered to sell to
him its 3900 shares for what they had
cost. Peyton rejected the offer.
Peyton repeated that his main rea
sor. for refusing to permit R. S. Pen
niman to inspect the books as agent
of the trust was because he was vice
president of the California Powder
Company, a. rival, and had instituted
malicious litigation against the cheml
ca) company.
Frank Turner, an employe of the
California Powder Company, to whom
Penniman desired certain of the chem
ical shares transferred and who ob
tained them at delinquent sale of the
trust company's stock yesterday sued

Poytons to exhibit their records. The
hearing was adjourned until next
Thursday.
