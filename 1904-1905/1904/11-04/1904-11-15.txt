In giving so much labor information.
J. B. Conroy of St. Louis and C. L.
Shamp of Omaha, both representa
tives of the International Brotherhood
of Stationary Firemen, read N The
Call's special edition before they ar
rived in the city and praised it very
highly. On their train were several
delegates, all of whom purchased as
many copies of* the paper as they
could procure from the news agent.
' . O. A. '.Tveltmoe, the secretary and
treasurer of the State Building
Trades Council of California, yester
day was profuse in his praise of The
Call's Federation ot J Labor edition
that appeared on Sunday morning.
He said the paper was beine sought
for by strangers in the city jand that
it* 1 would be kept by visitors *aa a ref
erence on labor Questions.
Fred Hudson, representing the
Western Central Labor Union of Se
attle," Wash., declared the edition was
one of the finest he had ever read and
one which would be thoroughly ap
preciated by every labor delegate now
visiting on the coast. He is a member
of Typographical Union No. 202.
John W. Morton, president of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen,
said The Call's Sunday morning edi
tion contained more labor literature
than was ever, printed in that number
of pages before and that it was the
intention of Eastern delegates to the
convention to circulate a large num
ber of copies throughout the sections
they represent.
J. B. Dale and L. B. Levitt, who
represent the Labor and Trades Coun
cil of Vallejo, pronounced The Call's
edition splendid. They said the paper
had been read by every laboring man
about, the navy-yards and in the vi
cinity of Vallejo, and that The Call
was the only paper to be seen in the
hands of the delegates at the head
quarters or. at the convention hall.
J. Fitzgerald, who represents the
Waiters' Union of this city, said 'The
Call's special edition was the finest
that ever happened." Fitzgerald has
assisted in entertaining ' a large
number of the visiting delegates and
says that all of them' extend congratu
lations to the paper, for its enterprise

chief magistrate of, San Francisco and
also as a- member of a labor unon.

President Knox of the California
State Federation" of Labor was next in
troduced by the chairman. He began
by welcoming: the delegates to the city
el San Francisco and the State of Cali
fornia and expressed the hope that the
visitors would take advantage of the
opportunity, afforded them by their
visit to see the other cities of the
State. He dwelt upon the work of ; the
State federation and its fight against
the Chinese and Japanese laborer.
Knox urgently^ asked the delegates, to
investigate personally the cheap labor
conditions of the Pacific Coast so that
when the time comes they will rally
to the support of the Western labor
men in their attempt to obtain effec
tive exclusion legislation. He closed
with a tribute to . President Gompers
and the work of the American Federa
tion of Labor in its active representa
tion of over 2,000,000 workingmen.j '
J. Williams, president of the City
Front Federation, spoke a few words
of welcome. and expressed the belief
of the federation in the principles of
advancement of the wage-workers of
the country. , . . .
P. H. McCarthy, followed in a speech
against the Citizens' Alliance,'; Herbert
George- and .the union man who know
ingly handles non-union goods. Mc-
Carthy's remarks were frequently ap
plauded. He welcomed the delegates
to' California and expressed the hope
that many of them would stay. here
after their work .was finished, | because,
as he said, he wanted California built
up by the best people.
"Not the Kind," he continued, "that
are brought here through the manage
ment of notorious scoundrels like Her
bert George; not .the kind brought
here by Murray & Ready, who are
save'd only by technicalities from be

shop will " not exist in California, no
matter' how many strike-breakers they
bring to maintain it. Their proceed
ings are bad for . workmen, and mil
lionaires alike, , as evidenced, by [ the

"We. have ! no fear of 'the; Citizens'

I ask you to do one thingâ see to it
that you do not pass non-union articles
and try to sell them to union men.

cf weicoir.e extended to the - federation. It
has betn ihe hope of the delegates for years
that they might some time come to California
and there hold one convention of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor in this great State
and city.
One ; by one representatives of trade unionism
have . come to the coast, but others followed,
and two years ago the executive council of
the federation for the first time in Its history
held, a session in this city. Â¦

this great city and State a* the old maxim
says, "Westward the Course of ' empire
takes Its way."' that a3 the men ot the early

tremendous odds, to establish camps, then

to me that this growth is typical of the steady
advance of organized labcr in California.

Typographical . Union of S^n Fran
cisco was appointed assistant secre
tary of the convention.
The committee on credentials then
made a report.
% Immediately following the report
William G. Schardt, representing the
Chicago Federation of Labor, declared
that his name had not been read and
desired to know if he was seated. He
was informed that the committee
would decide his case at the earliest
possible moment. - "

two weeks' session were then ap

to him because he is a cheap man, and no
progress is posstble .made up of cheap men.
Taking a view of the United States, ot Can
ada and Great Britain, the labor movement is
one. and with Porto Rico it is one. In a
short time this unification will extend to the
Continent, and then and not till then will the
much talked of universal peace be assured.

the convention to the best of our endeavor.
We shall not take away with us anything ex

in our record of work well done tn the inter

I may further add that I hope kindly ap

WALSH GIVES WELCOME.
During- your visit with us it will be our
pleasure to show you some of the beauties of
California, a. State In which nature has com
bined the elements in the production of her
choicest handiwork. The citizens of California
are proud of their heritage of mountain and
valley, of river and field. "We are proud, too,
of our people, the children of the hardy pio
neers of '49. -But, above â¢ and before all, we
ere proud of our labor movement â that struct
ure of our own hands â which, in extent and po
'tency, so fittingly complements the physical
characteristics of our surroundings.
The seed* of that movement were planted by
the giants of the early days- and through sun
shine and storm the crop has prospered ex
ceeding well. It Is our boast, and a justifiable
one I hope you will admit. . that San Fran
cisco Is one of the most thoroughly organized
cities in the United States. We, owe that fact
to the Eoundness of the principles upon which
our work is founded and upon which It has
been conducted. ! Those principles, I hardly
need remind you, , are the principles of the
American Federation of Labor.
It is now sixteen years since the San' Fran
cisco Labor Council, .then known as tha Fed
erated Trades, secured a charter at your hands,
a charter which, bearing the name of your,
and our. honored president, Samuel Gompers,
still traces the hall of the Labor Council, a
charter which has never been disgraced and
which, God willing, shall forever remain with
us as the emblem of our faith and the in
spiration of our hearts and hands.
In 1888, when that charter was granted, the
Labor Council stood here upon the shores of
the Pacific the solitary outpost of the labor
movement separated by a thousand miles irom
the nearest company of our friends. - To-day
we etand in the midst of the great army of
organized labor, the lines of which extead
north, south, east, aye, and west, in un
broken phalanx, ready to do. battle for the
cause in whicfc.we. are enlisted.
During these years many stirring events have
occurred. . but the principles of organized labor
have triumphed over all opposition, whether
from without or from within. In all this we
do not claim any special merit in ourselves.
We recognize, and we here make personal ac
knowledgment ;of the fact, that but for the
support of our fellow trade-unionists in other
parts of the country, organized and federated
under the banner of the American Federation
of Labor, we oould not possibly have . prosper
ed so rloriousÂ»y as we have.
Mr. President and delegates to the conven
tion, I feel that no words of mine, no words,
however eloquent. ; of human r tongue, can ex
press the pride and gratification with -which
the trade-unionists of San Francisco greet you
upon the eve of your labors. I feel, too, that
no formal expression of our regard is aseded.
Let me ask . you in â¢ all : sincerity to take tha
deed for the word. â¢
Again I bid you welcome, thrice, welcome,
within our- cates. Stay as Ion* as you can
and may the all-freeing One guide and bless you
there were red. white and blue stream-
I ers and shields with the national colors
j emblazoned on them in great profusion
at decorations in all. directions. Red,
white and blue banners depended from
I the center of the ceiling and were
looped up at the sides and ends of the
hall. Each State and Territory in the
United States was represented by a
red, white and blue shield and the
names of the sisterhood of States were
broadcast. Oddly, although there
I were British delegates on the stage,
I the placing of even so much as one
British flag in the scheme of decora
tions seemed to have been overlooked.
At the opening of the proceedings
President Gompers, his associated of
ficers and members of the local' recep
tion committee occupied the stage. The
other delegates sat in the body of the
hall. Long tables were arranged the
entire length of the auditorium. Beside
the tables sat the delegates in opposing
rows, each equipped with writing mate
rial, the general effect being to pro
duce the impression that a great num
ber of resolutions may be forthcoming.
If any delegate wishes to write reso
lutions the facilities are unparalleled.
Every seat in the body of the house
was taken by delegates. Near the door
outside of a railing that was guarded
%vas a fringe of worklngmen who were
interested spectators. Among the dele
gates -were several women. There was
also one negro delegate on the floor,
who rose to say something just before
the noon recess, but he was out of or
der, and a sharp series of raps of the
gavel in Gompers' hands caused him to
subside. The gallery that surrounds the
auditorium on. three, sides was com
pletely filled with spectators. Here also
were a few women, but the great ma
jority of the delegates and nearly all
the spectators were men.
YOUXG MEX NUMEROUS.
They were nearly all young men, two
thirds of the entire number, both in the
delegates' seats and in the galleries,
were 30 years old or less. The youngest
of the delegates is Robert S. Meloney '
of Lawrence, Mass., aged 22 yearsâ the
only delegate from east of Boston.
There were several others not much
older. Gray beards and gray hairs were
known only to a minority, and a small
minority at that.
The first cheers of the day were heard
when Mayor Schmitz climbed to the
stage and faced the audience. Gompers
received a good welcome. He Is smooth
ly shaven, short, stout, wears gold
bowed eyeglasses, a snugly fitting
Prince Albert coat of black, which re
veals a well-rounded figure; on the
fourth finger of his left hand is a hand
some seal tins: on his shirt front glit
ters a large diamond. When he jokes
with the audience he looks as benevo
lent as Mr. Pickwick. When he is ex
cited his voice rises, and the fact that
he has a strong, firm mouth and a
prominent nose Is impressed on the
spectators. Gompers' associates on the
stage were a comfortable looking lot
without exception. They were well
dressed, smiling and enthusiastic.
The two British delegatesâ Wagnall and
William Abraham, M. P. â have beards.
They looked like conservative business
men as they sat a good part of the day
on the stage. Mr. Abraham frequently
called out, "Hear, hear," when some
thing that pleased him was said.
After Gompers had called the conven
tion to order J. O. Walsh, "< president of
the San Francisco Labor Council, dellv- i
ered an address of welcome to the dele- '
Delegates Are Young Men ;
Gray Heads Are Few.
About 10:20 o'clock yesterday fore
noon Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, brought
dcw-n an ebony gavel with a resounding
thwack on a table in Lyric Hall, and
with that the- twenty-fourth annual
convention of the organization was
called to order.
There have been conventions of the
federation in a number of other Ameri
can cities, but this is the first ever held
in San Francisco. Local interest was
therefore intense. The day was filled
VP with events relating to the federa
tion and the topics that concern It.
In the forenoon there was a "glad
hand'' session, in which welcome was
extended and duly acknowledgfd. In
the afternoon President Gompers, Sec
retary Frank Morrison and Treasurer
John B. Lennon had the floor to them
selves, and they touk up the convention
timf making annual reports.
In the evening a reception t? Presi- i
Â«;ent* Â«>oÂ«?H/-: t - was givtji at Piom*er j
Hall by the retail clerks. At ihe Al
hambra a mass-meeting took place, at
tended by the Carmen's Union and
*;ighi branches of the Butchers' Union. I
At Native Sons' Hall the machinists j
gave a high jinks to James OConnell j
and other delegates.
Sessions of the American Federation |
of Labor often are stormy. There was
a sisrn of trouble when the convention
came together yesterday, and there will
undoubtedly be lively scenes before thp
work er.<is. The cloud that hung in the
pky yesterday was owing to the ques
tion? about the Chicago Federation of |
Labor. This body, so its leading mem- I
}.frs say, has a membership of some-!
thing like 200,000. It is in trouble with
the American Federation of Labor.
Yesterday its president, Schardt of Chi- j
capo, sat intently listening while the
committee on credentials reported. On
the face of the report Schardt and his
many followers were not even given
mention. They were n^t accredited as
being entitled to have delegates on the
floor. Schardt arose and quietly asked j
what was meant by the report. He was |
informed that organizations that were
not reported by the credentials com
mittee at that time would be given a
Fpecial report later. With that he sat
down, and nothing additional de
veloped openly regarding the Chicago
organization.
SOCIALISTS ARE EAGER.
Socialism will be brought up for dis
cussion before the convention ad
journs. Just when this will take place
no one seems to know. It may be in
troduced in fome form to-day. All of
yesterday prominent Socialists were ill
the spectators' gallery and they were
taking a very ljvely interest in the
jvroreedings, frequently exchanging
comments and speculations among
themselves.
At one particular spot there were at
least a dozen Socialists who have been
Â¦u-ell known all over the city during
the frequent agitation of Socialism.
There are Socialists as delegates on
the floor. Socialism has been before
the convention of the American Fed
eration of Labor before and has been
defeated. Since then the Socialists
fcsve succeeded in polling many more
votes than ever before at a general
election.
It is no secret that some of the
nore ardent Socialists believe that this
Is the opportune time to try' to see if
they can get the federation to indorse
their ideas. Socialism and the Chi
c&go difficulty were the leading themes
of conversation in the convention lob
bies yesterday.
Mixed with the speeches at the
opening of the proceedings of welcome
in the forenoon yesterday was the cus
tomary sound of sharp words. Presi
dent Gcrnpers and President Mc-
Carthy of the Building Trades Coun
cil were noted in this regard. The au
dience applauded with hands, boot
hc-els and voices when hard raps were
given. The, most applause went to
where there was a show of fight
against those who are considered by
the federation tq& be its enemies or In
denunciation of the Governor of Colo
rado and the Citizens' Alliance.
At the forenoon session a band of
music enlivened the beginning of the
proceeding?. It marched out ahead of
President Gompers. his official asso- |
ciates and the delegates from the Russ
House. It held the fort in the con
vention hall until the noon recess.
The first tune In the hall was #; My Own
United States," from the opera of
"When Johnny Comes Marching
Home." To this all the proceedings
of the day were attuned.
FLAGS IX QUANTITIES.
American flags were everywhere, on
the table of President Gompers, on the
tables at which the secretary of the
convention and the British and Can
adian delegates sat, looped up on the
front of the stage, at the back of the
stage, where two largre flags flanked
a larjre picture of Gompers. Then
Vitriolic Phrases In
troduced by the
Speakers.
Co-operative stores were discussed at
a gathering of the butchers' and street
carmen's unions at the Alhambra last
night. The house was filled and the
orators and the audience were enthu
siastic. Richard Cornelius, president of
the Carmen's Union, acted as chair
man. John L. Davie, ex-Mayor of Oak
land and head of the California Co
operative Meat Company; P. H. Mc-
Carthy and W. D. Mahon. president of
the International Street Carmen's Un
ion, were the speakers.
John Mitchell was expected to make
an address, but he sent word that ow
ing to other engagements he could not
appear.
P. H. McCarthy told of the organiza
tion of the Progressive planing mills,
and in a fiery address denounced the
policy of open shop and advocated co
operation. He said in part:
The beauty of co-oj>eration Is that no one
can be a millionaire. There Is no argument
strong enough to biock this, movement. AH
the Corbetts and FltzslmmonsÂ»s In the country

shops In San Francisco on the same lines as
! thÂ«s ones in Oakland.
J. Jj. DAVIE SPEAKS.
J. L. Davie was introduced by Corne
lius. He said in part:
I came back to Oakland about eight months
*go, having Just recovered from a Ion* Illness.
I had no money, but I had my nerve, with
me. I went to work at the butcher's block
at $2 5O a day and had been there but thre*
Â¦ days when I iound myself locked out. I
was Justly Indignant. Certain people came to
me and offered me work at a reasonable
salary. If I would comply with certain con
ditions. I told them that I would not. I
had tolled hard for the city of Oakland an<l
while I was Mayor there were no policemen
burglars. I gave the city a clean admlnis
' tration.
Well, we started the movement for co
operatlva butcher-shops. We started with no
office furniture but a barrel desk and a
table, but we had our nervÂ«. The California
Co-operative Meat Company started with one
(hop. Now it has five and we will bava
two more before December.
"W. D. Mahon said in part:
I have had little time In the last live or six
years to study this subject as I have been
busy with my own organization. The co
operative movement is often misunderstood.
aM confounded with Joint stock companies.
The difference between them is that In tha
co-operative plan the members work for one
another, in the Joint stock companies they
work one another. We have reached the point
where working men must study economy and
act like business men.
This movement Is not socialistic. We don't
want to tear down the castle, but we drÂ» want
to destroy the hovel. " Let us roll up our
sleeves and go into this movement with a
will and our opponents will soon go out of
business.
BARBERS EXTERTAIX.
The Journeymen Barbers' Union held
open house last night at their O'Farrell
street headquarters for the entertain
ment of the visiting delegates. Among
the visitors were President of the In
ternational Barters' Union Frank Nor
chang. Secretary J. C. Shanessy, J.
Shillebar. secretary of the Sheet and
Metal "Workers' Union: Frank Jordan,
business agent of the Western Miners'
Union of Colorado; W. E. Klapetzky.
past secretary and treasurer of the
Barbers' International Union, and
Frank Smith, president of the Oakland
Journeymen's Union. All these made
short addresses.
President Samuel Gompers addressed
a large gathering of retail clerks In
Pioneer Hall last night. If those pres
ent expected praise they were doomed
to disappointment. He accused them
of niggardliness and lack of apprecia
tion of what had been done for them by
members of other branches of organ
ized labor- After paining a victory the
members of the "associations," as they
usually prefer to style their organiza
tions, would disband sooner than pay
the 50 cents a month to keep their or
ganization alive. In about a year old
conditions would obtain, followed by
more agitation, another victory and on
Its heels another disbandment. The
clerks, he said, are -starving out their
own International officers to save a few
cents per capita. Mr. Gomper3 spoke
strongly In favor' of universal peace,
but he said It must either come from
mutual recognition or from fear.
The meeting was presided over by
Charles B. Whllden, president of the
district council of retail clerks. Among
the speakers were J. H. Devine of
Scranton, Pa., a delegate to the con
vention; Max Morris of Denver. Inter
national secretary- treasurer of the re
tail clerks: G. E. Schaver of Portland,
secretary of the State Federation of
Labor; Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz and
P". S. Lewis, national vice president of
the United Mine Workers.

CANNONADE OF SIEGE GUNS.
MUKDENV Sunday, Nov.. 13.^â An
unbroken cannonade of siege guns,
throwing fifty or sixty shells hourly
against the Japanese position in the
region of Shakhe station, was .begun
early this morning and ended only at
nightfall, when more than 600 big con
tact shells had been thrown into the
Japanese army's strongest position on
the plain for the purpose of demoraliz
ing the work of fortification concen-'
trated at that point for the past four
weeks. To-day's bombardment was
the most serious attempt yet made by
the Russians' large guns and it was
due to the apparent determination of
the Japanese to make Shakhe station
en impregnable defense of the railway

A friend of Dent saw the original

the letter there can be little doubt that
the men of the Baltic fleet were drunk
and scarcely knew what they were
doing. The letter reads as follows:
"We knew we were out of our course
and were afraid we would run aground
somewhere. Of the crews, officers and
men, many, I regret to say, were in
toxicated. An alarm was given that
the admiral's flagship had grounded
and in the confusion that followed thiÂ«
report three vessels of the rear squad
ron collided. While all was confusion
we came across what looked like a
flotilla of torpedo-boats and we opened
flre. Later in the night there was an
exchange of shots between our vessel
and another, and it was only when we
recognized from a small shell that
came aboard, but did not explode, that
the ammunition was Russian, that we
discovered that we had been firing upon
one another. "We had several men,
wounded." ,

NEW TORK, Nov. 14. â A hotel for
working girls and working 1 women will
soon be built in this city if the plans
now under consideration are carried
out. Philanthropy and business will
be combined in the running of the
hotel. Plans have been submitted by
an architect, involving the expenditure
of $300,000, but several well-known
men interested In the project think
that there will be no difficulty In rais
ing whatever money is necessary, be
cause assistance has been offered by
men prominent in the financial world.
The hotel probably will be In the
neighborhood of. the large department
stores on the "West Side, where many
girls and women are employed. Their
board at the hotel will be about 53 or
$4 a week. Nothing will be said to
the guests about religion or their
family affairs.
If the girls are out of employment
at any time the management will try
to tide them over until they get work.

He spent a great deal of his time
roaming around his cell, clad only in
his underclothes. Outside of his guard
ian, his attorneys and one or two news
paper men he had no callers to-day.
Not one of his relatives went near him,
and his old-time friend Adrian Wills,
who came to his rescue the night *of
the fire, was conspicuous by his ab
sence. Weber waxed angry once to
day. This was after he had read that
he was a lover of trashy literature and
a dime-novel fiend. He emphatically
denied the truth of these statements,
saying:
Jj "Will you please say for me in con
tradiction of the reports that have ap
peared in the papers that I have been
reading . sensational dime novels that
such is not the case. I have not been
reading trash of that sort. I have con
fined my reading entirely to biography
and to standard history for the last
two years. Reports that I . have . de
voted my time to reading trashy stuff
of the dime novel sort are detrimental
to" me and. to my case."
By the death of his four relatives
Adolph must naturally inherit the en
tire amount of his father's estate. . This
is valued # by conservative people here
to be nearly $100,000. This amount is
all well' invested in bonds and first
mortgages, all paying good rates of. in
terest. Outside of Adolph the imme
diate heirs of the estate are the brother
and sisters of Mrs. ,Weber. (
. Julius Weber himself had no kin in
this country. '. His bachelor brother who
lived in this State died some years ago.
It is reported that he has both brothers
and sisters In Germany, but they have
not been heard from since his death.
The Interview with ' Adrian Wills, a
former chum of young Weber, who
sheltered the accused youth on the
night of the tragedy, which was pub
lished In The Call, aroused young
Weber to the only display of emotion
he has made since his arrest. After
.reading it he gave The Call corres
pondent the following signed state
ment: .......
Tracy, the famous outlaw of Oregon
and Washington, it is said here, was
greatly admired by Adolph Weber. The
young man held up Tracy as an ex
ample. That young Adolph is an ex
traordinary character and that he is
what almost might be termed a psy
chological freak Is no longer a question
in the minds of those who have seen
him and have conversed with him. He
is as smart as a whip. His brain is
remarkably clear. Not one single ex
pression of sorrow over the loss of his
family has passed from his lips. He
has not uttered one single expression
of any kind that' would indicate he
had. the* le,ast regret, for. those who
were r so foullv and. brutally murdered.
So .far as- the -casual -observer can
ascertain, he -is utterly indifferent to
their passing a way. \ He has frequently
asked,. who will. get the- property left
by his father and if it would come di
rect to him; â¢
When the inquest is resumed on
Wednesday it is. expected that impor
tant evidence will be introduced. In
the absence of Sheriff Kenna, who is
now in San Francisco, Under Sheriff
William I. May is working night and
day to ferret out the perpetrator or
perpetrators of the horrible crime.
Some very important evidence has been
dug up to-day.
This afternoon Edgar McFayden, as
sistant cashier of the Placer County
Bank, is reported to have ordered steps
to be taken to prefer a charge against
young Weber of robbing the bank, on
June 26. It is reported that the cos
tume worn by the robber is now in the
possesion of the Sheriff here and that
he has ascertained where the garments
came from and that he only needs a
small link to complete the chain of
evidence. .{">"Â¦
Adolph Weber was as calm as usual
in his cell to-day. He maintained the
same coolness that .has marked his
bearing since the murder of his fam
ily. His cell is a large one. When he
was first put into it he rebelled against
its lack of conveniences. He said to
the jailer that he had been convicted
of no crime and that he should not be
thrown into a cell and treated as a
common prisoner. He asked for a fresh
and clean outfit for his bed and this
was given him. He was not satisfied
with the meals furnished to him, stat
ing that he was a sufferer from in
digestion and was obliged to live on a
prescribed diet and had the authorities
send out for some shredded wheat and
other food. He appeared to Â»njoy them
with a great relish.
ROAMS ABOUT CELJj.
AUBURN, Nov. 14.â That Mrs. Julius
Weber feared that her son Adolph
would commit some awful deed is a
fact that became known to-dav. The
information came from Mrs. Snowden,
sister of the unfortunate woman who
with her husband, daughter and son is
supposed to have met death at the
hands of her first born.
"I now remember," said Mrs. Snow
den, "that Mrs. Weber many times
said she was afraid of Adolph; that
she was afraid he would do some awful
deed; that he alwavs had such a pe
culiar disposition and that he had al
ways read peculiar books tttkt had had
a queer effect on his mind."
Mrs. Snowden is almost in a state of
nervous prostration. The awful or
deal that she has undergone since the
night of the tragedy has been telling'
heavily upon her. Her home Is only a
stone's throw from the scene of the
awful tragedy and the â¢ shrieks and
cries for help that issued from her
sister's home on " the night of the
tragedy are still ringing in her ears.
To-day she is almost beside herself
with grief. She says she can hardly
contain herself and that the terrible
scenes of . last Thursday night, when
fche stood on the porch and saw the
bodies of her sister, her niece Bertha
and her little nephew Earl brought out
of the flaming building and laid at her
feet are always before her eyes.

Th galleries of the group of forts on
the northern Dart of Keekwan Moun
tain were captured after desperate un
derground fighting. The Russians still
hold parts of the moat defended by the
galleries on North Keekwan Mountain.
The Japanese are now engaged in sap
ping operations for the purpose of dis
lodging the Russians, the result of
which It is believed will make the cap
ture of the moat an easy task.
The capture ofÂ»thls fort would give
the Japanese the key to the eastern
fortified range, as artillery mounted
there would dominate the forts in
front of the ridge and enable the Jap
anese to place infantry In a position
to sweep the ridge.
During the general attack on the
eastern fortified ridges on . October 30
the Japanese gained the moats of the
principal forts attacked by them. These
meats were found to be wider, deeper
and stronger than had been expected,
and were defended by caponiere gal
ltTies.
The powerful east Keekwan fort
was gained, but the Russians were re
inforced and drove the Japanese down
to the foot of the hill. The Japanese
are now sapping toward the crest ol
the hill.

AND -OTHERS.
The better class of druggists, everywhere, are m'en of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devot.j iheir lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in accordance with physicians* prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many, excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinalnames and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
Thej are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the nnest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Â»yrnp of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction, v
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, .tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to.be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignitv and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
Borne times have the name â " Syrup of Figs "âor "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on. the package, but they never have the full name of
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs v or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages onlv, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform tne public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation .which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company-
California Fi| Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class of
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

bership of tho organizations affiliated to tho American Federation of

" A brief resume of events leading up to and
In connection with the outrage against not
only the rlshts of labor but civilized society,
may not here be amiss. Four years ago -the
Colorado Legislature passed a law limiting
the hours of labor of men who worked la the
mines and in the smelters to eight per day.
The courts of the State declared that inas
much as there was no constitutional authority
vested in> the Legislature for the enactment
of such a law. the act was void. The subse
quent Legislature adopted an amendment to
the constitution giving the Legislature that
needed authority, and made It mandatory
upon the Legislature to enact such a law. The
amendment was submitted to a vote of the
people of Colorado, and, It was ratified by
more than 47.0OO majority, and thereby became
a of the State constitution.
The Legislature which had this direct man
date from the people utterly failed to comply
therewith, and It 1Â» authoritatively aÂ»serted^
and not denied, that Governor Peabody owed
his nomination- and election to the office he
occupies upon the distinct understanding and
agreement with the prime movers of the so
called Citizens' Alliance that he would pre
vent, if possible, an agreement by the two
houses of the Legislature upon any eight-hour
bill; or that If agreement was reached.^ despite
his effort. 'that he would veto such Â» *>Â«'Â¦ JJ
was unnecessary for him to exercise his rtght
of vetS. InasmTch as Ms effort, to prevent
agreement in the passage of the bill made the
exercise of that function unnecessary.
The indignation of the people general y.
particularly the working people, at this pol t
ical manipulation and trickery, was emphatic
and a keen sense was clearly manifested that
their rights and their Interests had been fla
erantly betrayed. Disputes arose resulting in
the effort to enforce by private agreement
what the lawmakers, the misrepresentatlves
of the "eople. had failed to do: that Is, the
establishment of an eight hour workday.
In several Instances strikes occurred: some
directly for the eight hour day. others In sym.
nathv At once a system of persecution was
inaugurated by the employers' associations,
which assumed the title of Citizens' Alliances.
Men against whom no charge of wrongdoing
could be made were dragged from their homes
and deported to other districts and to other
States. Public officials, elected by the people.
Hemming. Scranton. Pennsylvania.
The iniquitous policy of the so-called Citi
zens' Alliance has had Its fullest fruition In
Colorado. In that State it has not only of it
self had full away, but It haa< been aided In
the execution of Its edicts by the executive
with the full power of the military. Indeed,
the Citizens' Alliance had but the simple dec
laration to make as to Its wishes and what in
Its Judgment constituted the law to have the
Governor of the State order the troops to the
most convenient point to execute what was
accepted as a decree. Civil government has
been set at naught, and constitutional and
natural rights and guarantees wantonly tram
pled under foot. â¢
were summoned before secret meetings of these
greedy monopolists, and simply because -they
â¢ refused to acquiesce in the employers' out
rageous conduct, were summarily deposed
from office and the- agents of employers
directed to usurp these offlces and perform
their functions and duties. In one instance a
rcj>e with a noose at the end waa tossed at
thÂ© feet of an officer of the local government,
elected by the people, with the cholcÂ» given
him of peremptorily resigning: his efflce or to
take the consequences of the other silent, yet
effective, alternative presented to him.
DENOUNCES GOVERNOR.
The Governor has aided and abetted this
criminal procedure and* utilized the mllltary
forces cf Colorado to violate every vestige oÂ£
human right recognized for more than seven
centuries aa wrung from an unwilling mon
arch In the Magna Charta. as*erted In the
Declaration of Independence, guaranteed b/
thÂ« constitution of our country and of our
States and fortified by every statute in our
; Governor Peabody not only declared martial
law and . military rule, applying to district*,
without authority of law and in conflict wltn
Â¦ the plain previsions of the constitution of
Colorado, but he even demeaned himself to
the exercise cf that rreat power to apply
to a single individual. Men charged with no
crime or offense against the laws were cor
ralled and with the butt end cf a gun or at
the point of a. bayonet driven like cattle into
a bull pen. while others were bodily carried or
driven into another State.
We aaÂ»ert tÂ»>at under no circumstances had
the . Governor of Colorado, without the con- '
uent of the Legislature, the right or authority
to declare martlnj law or military rule; that
holding men in duress In that brutal military
prison. thÂ» bull oen; that depriving men of
their liberty without due procers of law, was
not only a brutal outrage of the rights of
the men themselves, but an unblushing wrong
to all men. If the miners In the disturbed
districts of Colorado were guilty of any crime.
If they violated any law of the land, there,
are in existence uson the statute books laws
for their am>rehenslon and trial before thÂ»
duly constituted courts by a- Jury of their
peers according to the due proce*ses of law aa
made and provided In such cases.
The tyrant of old exercised his spleen with
those from whom ke differed and deported,
banished cr exiled them. Clvlllxed man has
come to recomlie such punishments aa un
luat and unnatural. Even Russia has recently
abolished the decree. It has remained for the
unspeakable Peabody. Governor of the great
State of Colorado, to revive and put this be
r.lghted punishment into execution: and this,
too In Â«slte of tho fact that there Is not in
our country one scintilla of law authorizing
any court or any officer to deport, banish or
exllÂ« a citizen from, his State or from, the
country.
We have not. cannot and will not condone

The convention, after an hour's re- ,

Soon after resuming President Gom
pers submitted his annual report, of
which liberal extracts are as follows:
REPORT OF GOMPERS.
The cycles of t'.tr.e that roll so swiftly by
and which era so infinitesimal when counted
'.n connection with taÂ« history and develop
ment cf the human race rind the people con
fronting new conditions and new problems.
The pa*t has l>e*n fraught with pain and
travail. It ha* b^-n an inarticulate yearning
and a ccnetar.t struggle for new light and the
realisation of new hopes. From the dark days
of slavery and serfdom to the era of wage,
labor was. In itself, a great progress. The
entrance of the wape earners Into the realms
of the largÂ»?r. broader and brighter vision of
associated effort has be<-n fraught with achieve
ments cammar.Jimy the wonder and admiration
of Â«ud>-i3te and observers.
Dispute it as eome may. we are conscious,
and history will accord us the credit, of being
the natural and rational, crystallized effort of
the rcastee to abolish wrong and Injustice;
to attain Justice and ripht by the most peace
ful, Â«volutJonary an<i humane method. The
immediate future is pregnant with good or
ill for the people of our country. It devolves
~i :. the organized labor movement to deter
ir.ln* by Its course the form It shall assume.
The constant lmpro\-ement in machinery,
the division, subdivision and eiwclallzatlon of
labor, the wonderful develcrnvnt in Industry
fcnd the concentration of wealth, give to the
wealth possessors extraordinary power, which,
whpn coupled with the cunning and greed for
pain, unless Intelligently directed and compre
hensively met by a well organized labor move
ment, will tend to the dtttrioration of our
race, the destruction of all our achievements
and the dissipation of all our hopes.
On the other hand. If we are faithful to the
history a.nd traditions of thÂ«> Â«=truÂ»rgllni5 maeses
in the part. If TÂ»e shall prove true to the In
terests and welfare of the ho*ts of labor
ef our day, the power calculated to injure
will be diverted to the common weal, and thus
open vp vistas cf larger opportunities and
a broader conctpticn of human rights and en
nobling aspirations.
As the cours* of enlightenment and liberty
wends Its way west ward, fro the American Fed
â¢ ration of Labor brings its host of enlightened
and lilxrrty-lovine exponents to the entrance
Ol the Golden Gate, there net only to stand

COXFEDERATIOVS STATUS.
Mucl: gleeful speculation has been indulired
In by our opponents in what they are pleased
to characterize as a "slump" in the organiza
tion of the wage-earners In the trade union
movement of our country- They would hail
Â¦with Joyo-js acclaim could they record the
total extinction and destruction of our move
ment. With them the wish Is father to the
thought that they might bring about what
the'.r chief sivikei-man. Parry, lately dec;ared
tbtlr purjjufe to be. "the annihilation of labor
unions." They take unctlin to their *ouls
that the tl'sbt falling off in membership in
the trade union movement for a brief period
within the x^aEt year was the beginning of
the decline of the organized labor movement
cf our country.
The law of growth in organized labor Is as
little understood by them as it Is by others
who lack the experience or who have not had
the time, orr'crtunity or inclination to In
â¢j-uire and study. From the formation of the
first bona. fide trade union movement in mod
em times it has grown with each era of in
dustrial activity an* receded to some degree
with each industrial depression, but with Â»ach
recMrrln" revival in Industry the decree of
growth has been greater and with Â«ach recur
ring period of depression it has receded to a
lesser cecrr-e thar- itj> immediate predecessors.
Ai: students Â»f our movement appreciate these
facts and count with them. Ttie antagonists
and the Ignorant view these natural economic
chaDK*-i with exultation cr alarm.
If the employers followed their policy of
wase reductions in previous years as a sup
posed way out of Industrial stagnation, and
thereby simply accentuated the situation and
made it worse. Is It not a logical Inference
that the same ruinous policy would be pursued
MAKES MANY CLAIMS.
It is held now that there can ' be no real
natural famine in the world because of the
easy facilities with which the remotest corners
of the earth can be reached. Purely If this
be true, and no Informed,' Â«ane, reasonable
beirg disputes It. there Is an utter absence of
excuse for non-employment, hunger, poverty
or misery in our land, a land -so- richly and
bountifully blessed. When Idleness and its
consequent misery are permitted to come
among our people It Is due entirely to rapa
cious, sordid avarice, mismanagement and in
competency on the one hand, or to - ignorant
indifference and culpable pliancy on the other.
The employers generally typify the one and
the workers formerly typified I the other.
Of course, no one who understands the com
plex conditions of Industry, economics and
the makeup of modern society, and who aided
in the formulation of this policy of our move
ment, expected to escape criticism, denuncia
tion, and condemnation from labor's oppo
nents. It was expected and anticipated. It
would have civen us cause to inquire as to
the accuracy of our course had the position
we took met the approval of these who did
not understand, ffnd those who. sordid, short
sighted, mad, rush for immediate gain and
behind them to a beneficent movement,
not fcr labor alone, but for the common weal.
In former periods when an industrial reac
tion -was manifest, employers generally viewed
the situation from their own Immediate stand
point only, without regard to their own broad
Interest or the general good. Their first re
course was to that which to them seemed
the eaÂ«le*t course to continue the operation
of their plants â to find markets. They re
duced wages. Reduction of wages followed In
quick order; the consuming power of the
masses was curtailed and still more limited,
entailing wholesale discharges of workmen who
were formerly employed In producing the
things the masses, the -workers, formerly con
sumed. Inducing and giving the further cause
i.o ct ill further entaiiment of consumption and
production and still more discharges of work
men, until millions were unemployed: the
wheels cf industry and commerce paralyzed:
until men were walking the- highways and
byways of our country in Idleness, wiille pov
erty, hunger and misery stalked through our
land.
Sixthâ Prevent industrial conflicts wherever
possible, and particularly to resist all attempts
to reduce wares.
Fifthâ Voluntarily and faithfully abide by
and fulfill th<Â» terms of agreements and the
awards of arbitrators thereunder.
Thirdâ Stand shoulder to shoulder In stress
and strife: to help bear each other's burdens
and perfect the bends of brotherhood.
Fourth â Endeavor to maintain industrial
peace by trade agreements with employers.
In my report to the last convention occa
sion was taken to call attention to what
was then apparent to but few, that we were
then confronted with an Impending: Industrial
reaction. It was stated that though the re
action was then not pronounced yet it was
Impending, and that if a wise course was
pursued by us the reaction could and would
be prevented from developing Jnto an In
dustrial crisis or panic. The Boston conven
tion, readily realizing the situation, promptly
adopted the suggestion made to meet and
overcome It; and the toilers. organized
and unorganized. responded In a man
ner that should cause; us not only
irreat irratlflcatlon. but should receive
the lasting- gratitude of all the people of our
entire country. The recommendations we
made to our fellow workers consisted of six
important features:
FirstâOrganize, unite and federate.
Secondâ Have faith and confidence In them
selves and each other.
THE BOSTON' CONVENTION.
The average membership of our affiliated
unions upon which per capita tax has been
paid to the American Federation of Labor for
the year ending September 30, 1904, Is 1,670 â¢
COO. The average membership of our affiliated
unions upon which per capita tax was paid to
the Amerft-an Federation of Labor for the year
ending September 30. lÂ»03. was 1.465,800.
W* shall no doubt be confronted with the
kfenfst opposition In the near future. There
are thos- who will not understand the purposes
of the organized labor movement and the good
work whu-h It is doing and which it can and
will do. and it therefore behooves us to de
votÂ» our attention and to concentrate our
efforts more largely in bringing to the atten
tion of the yet unorganized how necessary it
is for the protection of themselves and those
d^pend^nt upon them to secure and maintain
the vantage ground already trained, and not
only to save all from the inevitable downward
peth that leads from a lack of comprehensive
and united effort, but to secure and realize
the hefes and aspirations of the tolling masses.
Therefore, with unbounded faith In the ulti
mate triumph of our great cause, the logical
ar.d natural development of our great move
ment, we may all take on new obligations and
assume new vows to leave no effort untried
â¢which Fhall bring within the beneficent fold
o T the trade union movement the wage workers
the wealth producers of America, So lone
aÂ« thÂ»-re is a wrong- unrlichted, . or a right
dtnied to the people, so long Is there work
for the trade un'on movement to-do.
Despite the destructive purpose^ of labor's
antagonists I am in a position to report that
with the exception of a slight recession al
rtady indicated, there has been a sum total
of great gain in the membership of the or
ganizations affiliated to the American Federa
tion of Labor. From October 1. 1903, to Sep
tember 30. 1904, we Issued from the American
I-ederatlon of Labor the following charters:
International unions, 11; State federations 5;
central labor unions. 99; local trade unions
and federal labor unions, 32S; total. 443.
Eight of these international unions were
eiRanized by us from formerly affiliated char
tered local unions during the past year. A
number of international unions have become
amalgamated with other International unions
kindred to their trade. At the end of the
fiscal year. September 80, 1004. there were
affiliated w!th the American Federation of
Labor 120 International unions, consisting of
arrrcximately, 27.000 local unions of theii
respective trades and callings, 32 State federa
tions. Sd> central labor unions 1271 local
trade unions Â«nd federal labor unions; total.
ISSUE OF CHARTERS.
The wan-earners have come to realize that
their onlv hoi>e for the protection of their
material Interests In our time, the only op
portunities for the promotion of these ln
tert-s*- in the future, as well as the mainstay
for the rights and liberties In the present, to
which they and those who may lollow are
entitled, lie In unity, organization and federa
tion. And they have recognized, too, to a
greater extent than heretofore that their
cohesion during a period of industrial reaction
Is the enVctunl check upon the material de
terioration In their condition with all that that
Implies. To these reasons and causes, to
gether with greater intelligence and a fair con
ception of their rights, may be attributed the
almost infinitesimal decline In membership
within the recent past.
When it is borne in mind that the trade
union movement of America Is, comparatively
speaking, etill in Its infancy; when there 1Â»
taken into consideration the vast extend of
territory as well as the makeup of different
nationalities speaking foreign tongues, the
great development in industry and the con
centration of wealth, using its powers to pre
vent or crush out organizations; when all
these things are given due consideration, that
Â«<â¢ have brought about any degree of fra
ternity and homogeneity should be counted to
our credit rather than to our detriment.
It is not necessary here to recount the ad
vantages which have been secured by our
movement In the interests of our fellow work
ers. Not only are our records of achieve
ments available to all, but the better results
in thÂ« home, the more material Improvement
the social and moral advancement, as well as
political Independence, and the character and
manhood of our working people, are the best
attestation, demonstration and proof of the
etlorts. the work, the alms, methods and
ennobling purposes of our. movement.

of a Year in the United States

COMMITTEE REPORT.
TELLS OF CONVENTIONS
HELD AT BOSTON.
/\a many cities employers, antagonistic to
labor, have formed themselves Into so-called
citizens' alliances and have undertaken to prop
agate the policy of the destruction of organ
ized labor, their first effort being directed
to what they are pleased to term the "open
shop," and to attack the union shop under
the false assertion that It is a "closed shop."
In my last reoort I had occasion to give this
subject considerable attention. Since then
some have pretended that the entering Into an
agreement of an employer with a union by
which exclusively union men are to be em
ployed by him is in violation of law; that It
denies the right to employment of workmen
who are not members of the unions.
In the first instance the claim Is absurd
when It Is known that the union not only
opens wide Its doors, inviting all to Join, but
sends out its organizers and missionaries to
Induce by every honorable means within their
power the non-unionists to share In the ad
vantages that come from united and associated
effort. But quite apart from this consideration
is .this fact, that an employer may give a con
tmct to a. dealer to furnish him with raw ma
terial, or to erect a plant, or to furnish him
with machines, the contractor to have the ex
clusive right to furnish and provide these
things. Such a contract Implies and provides
the exclusion of all other dealers, builders, or
machinery manufacturers. Is such a contract
held to be Improper or unlawful? Are not
hundreds of thousands of contracts of this
character made daily? The agreement between
DISCUSSES OPEX SHOP.
The vantage position now occupied by labor
was not brought to it on a silver platter, but
was contended for and won by the unity of
the workers, by the burdens which they have
borne, and the sacrifices they have made.
More thorough organization, a greater willing
ness, to accumulate funds In the unions,- the
spirit of fraternity and solidarity, will bring
their own reward and the recognition not only
of employers but of the world. It may be
safely asserted that as a rule. In our time,
those who have no power to insist upon and
maintain their rights have no rights to main
tain.
Wealth and the combination of wealth are
the means and the power of the employers In
any difference or dispute with labor as to
the conditions of employment. Those possess
ing means and power yield little or nothing to
those of opposite interests, when the latter
possess little or no means or power to resist
oppression. We must come to realize what
a prominent newspaper recently frankly, even
If brutally, uttered, that "there is no senti
ment in business," and that "industrial plants
are not eleemosynary institutions." Altruism,
though more generally preached. Is not prac
ticed; and particularly does this apply in the
relations of employers to workers. Though we
may contend that ethical considerations should
enter into the discussion of the wage workers'
demands for a better return for their labor,
their rightful demand for a higher and a bet
ter life, we should all realize that the con
ception and desideratum In the Industrial prob
lem will receive a magnificent Impetus when
labor is better organized, federated and
equipped with means and power to enforce
Its rights.
We would abolish war, industrially as well
as internationally: but Its abolition must come,
and It will come from conscious' power. In
telligent and broader humanity. May the day
never come when peace Is proclaimed or main
tained because of the inanition of the work
ers. Peace, to be desirable, to be lasting,
advantageous and humane, must come from a
virile and Intelligent manhood. We want no
peace, and there never will be peace, found
ed upon the servility and degradation of the
workers.
But apart from strikes concretely considered
and the accumulation of funds with which to
win them when undertaken, there Is another
important side to this question to be con
sidered, and that Is, the maintenance of in
dustrial peace. It Is a condition for- which
wo may devoutly pray and work; but so long
as private greed or short-sighted, lnterestt
dominate the Judgment and actions of employ
ers. Just so ions- will strikes, or better still,
the preparedness of labor to strike, be the
determining factor to bring about industrial
peace on a more equitable basis, add to pre
vent an industrial rupture.
Of course, no one pretends or believes that
all strikes can be won. but that greater
victories will be won and fewer defeats will
occur when oxir unions have accumulated
funds not even our most rabid antagonists
will dispute. _
May I use tile homely phrase of saying that
we are not yet "out of the woods." and that
the advice and watchword should go forth
from this convention of the American Fed
eration of Labor to the tollers of our country
to resist by .every honorable and lawful means
at their command any and every attempt to
reduce wages. At the risk of criticism I re
peat last year's paraphrase that in the offer
of waere reductions it Is better to resist and
lose than not to resist at all. The resistance
will at least demonstrate that labor is an
equation and factor which must not be ig
nored In the material, economic. Industrial,
commercial and social affairs and welfare of
our people and our country.
During the past year some strikes occurred,
and among them some were lost; that is. they
were not crowned with the immediate success
for which they were inaugurated. And It is
not only Just, but timely, to say that each
of these failed of its object by reason of the
fact that the men did not profit by the
experience of others and take time by the
forelock. In times of Industrial tranquillity
and while they were employed they failed to
contribute Anything like commensurate dues In
their unions, andi to provide themselves with
the ammunition of industrial contest, a good
treasury. There was not one strike which
failed during the entire year but which the
leaders and management were confident could
and would have been crowned with victory if
but a good, round sum had been in the treas
uries of their organizations.
RESISTANCE IS URGED.
In considering this entire subject In its eco
nomic and social aspect, we dare not fall to
realize the difference- between resistance to
Â¦wage reductions and the movements for wage
advances during periods of Industrial reactions.
It Is a science becoming more generally un
derstood by labor to know when to strike and
when not to strike; to know for what to striTce
and for what not to strike. It Is said that
it is not wise to strike on a so-called "failing
market" It cannot however, successfully be
gainsaid that a strike or preparedness to strike
in resisting an offer of wa^e reduction will
prevent the market from falling still lower. It
may not be, and undoubtedly Is not, wise or
prudent to strike for ware advancement on a
downward industrial trend, yet it Is better
that even this economic error be committed
than a complacent acceptance of wage reduc
tions.
The results of labor's policy are our best Jus
tification, and even though contemporary com
ment may not generally accord us the credit
and commendation which are Justly our due,
we have the knowledge and satisfaction of the
lasting service and benefit which we have ren
dered our fellow man.
Fifth â The prospect for a revival In Indus
try and commerce In the future Is brighter, as
compared with any similar previous period.
Sixthâ There U less acute feeling of unrest
among workmen and employers generally,
business men and all our people.
Seventh â There are more workmen and em
ployers in agreement and understanding.
Eighth â There is a more general . effort to
brin* about more rightful relations between
workmen and employers.
Ninth â There Is a better conception of the
rights and duties of man to man. a more gen
eral satisfaction among our people with the
present, and a more gratifying and hopeful
outlook for the future.
Fourth â The era of industrial stagnation, as
compared with former like conditions, has
been shortened.
la the present era.? Are all the dire experi
ences and sufferings of our people to go for
naucht? Should we permit Ignorant indiffer
ence on our part to make us culpable for a
repetition of the awful conditions which fol
lowed In the wake of the former mischievous
and wrongful course of our employers, or shall
we continue the course which we last year de
clared when we had the prescience to foresee
the danger with which we were threatened?
Organized labor then called a halt and de
clared the entire policy of wage 'reductions un
wise, wrongful and dangerous to the well be
ing of labor and of all our people.
We were fully aware that It would be Im
possible to prevent all wage reductions, but
we can view the result of our last year's
declaration of policy of resistance to wage re
ductions with satisfaction and pride. We can
challenge our critics and opponents to compare
the past year, when we were confronted with
an industrial reaction, with a year of similar
industrial situation, and It will demonstrate
beyond cavil or doubt that â
First â Wage reductions have been checked.
Second â ThÂ« Industrial situation has not be
come acute, aa was the uniform course for
merly.
Third â Much idleness, poverty, suffering and
misery have been prevented.
If a policy of so-called Industrial form of. or
ganization be Justifiable and advantageous,
as against that of the trade union form, with
Its constant development, with changing condi
tions in industry, then an organization formed
a few months ago in San Antonio. Texas, is
the best expression and exponent of that no
tion for that organization sneers contemptu
ously at the organization of the different unton3
of the building trades, and styles Itself "The
United Brotherhood of Builders of America.
It denounces roundly the trade unions, and in
the usual language of the so-called Industrial
ists Invites to membership in the one organ
ization carpenters and plumbers, painters and
bricklayers plasterers and bridge and struc
tural iron workers, electrical workers and hod
carriers, building laborers and machinists, and
every man who is either directly or remotely
employed In the preparation of the material
for ft building or In the construction of the
building itself. It necessarily followa that if
such a form of organization Is most Â«dvan
tageous to the workmen employed In the build
ing trades it will apply with equal advantage
to all others. This Is the logical result of the
reasoning â¢ of some of our mistaken fellow
trade unionists, who. with more enthusiasm
than clearness of vision, urge what they eu
phoneously call an Industrial form of organ
ization. ,,.
Our trade union movement, which deals with
conditions as they arise and takes advantage
of experience to turn it to the best account of
our fellow-workmen, may not be so alluring;
it may not bear the apparent glamour and dash
which some would have the labor movement
assume but ours is the movemerft of labor,
founded upon the historic development of the
tollers' associated effort; It battles In labor's
interests to-day, and is marshaling the forced
of united labor in Its regiments and bat
talions the better to defend, the better to
withstand, the better to maintain, the better
to clear the pathway for a safer and more
successful advance to-morrow and to-morrow.
The defense fund has been of vast benefit
to our directly affiliated unions, not only
In sustaining our members In any difficulty,
but particularly ir. preventing employers' at
tacks The realization that t*ie men of or
ganized labor have a defense fund which can
be concentrated upon any given point to pro
tect the rights and Interests of our fellow
workers hae had a palpable and beneficent
Experience has shown that our prcseat law
upon -this subject Is somewhat defÂ«-.lve, nnd
which it has been neceesary by administrative
acts to overcome. I suggest, however, that
they be remedied by their legal enastnunt Into
our constitution, and therefore recommend the
adoption of changes and amendments. â¢
The union labels have been a source of great
advantage to labqr and to all people. The la
bel Is at once a guarantee and an assurance
that the conditions under which an article is
produced have been comparatively fairer and
better- â¢ that the labor of children has not en
tered Into ltÂ« production: that convict. Chi
nese sweat shop or other inferior labor is no
component part entering into the production of
the article; that the sanitary conditions at
tending Its production are of the highest or
der thus affording the friends of our move
ment the opportunity to sympathize with Its
purpose, as well as giving our own constitu
ent membership the opportunity of exercising
their powers â¢ of patronage, that they may
give their material as well as their moral sup
port and encouragement. - * \.
In order that the best Information upon the
history philosophy and purposes of the union
label may be available to the uninformed and
the opponent, as well as to afford our own
membership the better opportunity to answer
the whys and .wherefore of .the union label,
the executive committee gave 'me power to of
fer prizes for the best three essays upon the
subject of the union label. Impartial examin
ation and â¢ awards were made upon â¢ the es
says submitted, the Judges being Henry W.
Sherman, general secretary of â¢ the Brother
hood of Electrical Workers; Arthur E. Holder,
assistant editor of the International Associa
tion of Machinists' Journal, and Joseph M.
Johnson, then president of Columbia Typo
graphical Union No. 101. ThÂ« Judges made the
following awards: First. prize. Walter Macar

No observing, experienced and faithful trade
unionist believes that a hard and fast rule of
Jurisdiction can bo proclaimed and enforced
which will apply with exactitude to all trade
unions alike. There are different conditions,
circumstances and environments in most in
stances and each must be approached, con
sidered and determined with particular refer
ence to Its immediate and kindred trade, oc
cupation and development
The Scranton convention appointed a special
committee, consisting of James Duncan. John
Mitchell. John Mulholland. T. M. Hughes and
myself, to consider and report^upon the ques*
tion of trade autonomy and Jurlsdictlonal dis
putes. The report of that committee was
unanimously adopted. Perhaps it was then.
bf it is now. the best expression of the Judg
ment of our movement upon these subjects,
and It is commended anew to your very serious
consideration. \ It stands out In significant con
trast to the logical disastrous consequences
which would result to the interests of labor
were It possible to Introduce what some are
pleased to term Industrialism.
UNITED BROTHERHOOD.
It also affords me pleasure to be enabled to
report to you that the effort to eliminate a
source of constant friction and conflict in the
carpentry trade will In a short time, I firmly
believe, be crowned with success. At our
recommendation the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners of America and the-
American District of the Amalgamated Socletyi
of Carpenter* and Joiners submitted their mat
ters of difference to arbitration, selecting A.
Strasser as umpire. His award made pro
vision for a rational and advantageous form
of amalgamation, providing in the meantime
for a working agreement, which in the main
has been faithfully complied with. I am ad
vlyed that the United Brotherhood has in
structed its president to appoint a committee
to meet a like committee of the Amalgamated
Society for the purpose of arranging the de
tails of the amalgamation and to submit the
same to a referendum vote of the membership
of the brotherhood for ratification; that the
Amalgamated Society is now voting upon the
proposition, the highest authority in .that or
ganization having favorably recommended it
to the membership. If this be ratified and
amalgamation occur, which we earnestly hope
will be done,' one great source of contention
will have disappeared from labor's field of
usefulness. The matter is more fully covered
In the executive council's report. "
In several caÂ«-s, after conferences.' many
matters of Jurisdiction have been adjusted with
rood results to all parties concerned. A num
ber of the Jurisdlctlonal disputes which have
largely . occupied the attention of. former con
ventions, have. If possible, become still more
acute and have entailed upon your officers an
enormous amount' of work, expenditure of time
a* well as expense to the federation without
bringing a compensatory advantage to the
men or to the organizations engaged In such
controversies. .
Notwithstanding every effort to help In the
solution of the disputes relative to trade union
Jurisdiction much progress cannot be reported.
In the case of the International Association of
Allied Metal Mechanics and the other ma
chinery and metal trade unions, you will be
gratified, I. am sure, to be officially advised
that by a conciliatory spirit * manifested by
all directly interested an addition to the vol
untary self-effacement of the officers of the
allied metal mechanics, that International as
sociation, November 1, 1904, amalgamated with
and became part of the International Associa
tion of Machinists.
Union In Its effort to enforce the eight-hour
day, but that a special committee be appointed
by this convention to give the subject-matter
ter consideration; that the committee should
consult with the officers and representtives of
the International Typographical Union durln*
the convention and report thereto before ad
journment; that either that committee or an
other committee be authorized to be appointed
for the purpose of co-operating with the excu

so that he best possible aid can be rendered to
our fellow workers in the great movement that
they have undertaken and In which they have
the hopes, wishes, prayers, and co-operation
of every one interested In the welfare of the
human family and the progress and civilization
of our people.
Of course. In the effort to help one particular
organization, especially in the laudable purpose
it has mapped out for Itself to achieve, we
are not circumscribed or limited in our effort
to help any and all of our fellow â¢workmen
who are In a position to make any effort
for the advancement or promotion of their
Interests. We shall, therefore, welcome not
only the initiative of our fellow unionists to
obtain Improved conditions, and particularly
the Improved conditions that come from e.
shorter workday, but we shall be glad to help
In the Initiation of any movement that will
contribute in any way toward the protection,

of our fellow workmen, and to render them
every assistance within our power. ~
JURISDICTION TREATED.
These propositions were submitted to a ref
erendum vote of the membersnlp of the Inter
national Typographical Union. No official In
formation has'yet been given me as to the final
result of thfe vote. From Information received,
however, it is certain that the proposition has
been favorably decided. The membership at
the Fame time voted in favor of assessing
themselves to accumulate a defense fund in
the meantime, to stand the members in good
stead should necessity require them to enforce
their demands by a cessation of work.
The American Federation of Labor has been
of Incalculable benefit to a large number of
International unions and! local unions In the
introduction and enforcement of the eight-hour
workday, as attested by the. large number of
our fellows who now work under that rule.
Inasmuch as the International Typographical
Union has taken the initiative of its own ac
cord in the matter of Introducing and enforcing
the eight-hour'workday.- 1 submit for your con-
Eide'ratlon and recommend that this movement
of the International Typographical Union re
ceive the sincere and hearty Indorsement and
co-operation of this convention of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, and of every union
member as well as every wage earner and
those who sympathize with practical, evolu
tionary, economic progress.
It Is not now known whether there will be
any contest against the eight-hour day;
whether any antagonistic action will be taken
by the employers to the men. We do know,
however, that at the last convention of the
employing printers of the United States, or
ganized under , the name of . the Typothetae,
a resolution was adopted declaring against that
movement. In any event. It seems clear to
me that every action should be taken by this
convention and by our organizations generally,
not only to pledge the support of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor and Its affiliated
unions to the International Typographical
Taking cognizance of the vast progress In
the development of the printing trade, the In
ternational Typographical Union at Its last
convention adopted a resolution declaring that
on January 1, 1900. a general eight-hour work
day shall be enforced. The effort' is to be
made to secure the co-operation of the printing
employers and to bring about the change by
mutual agreement.
PRINTERS' MOVEMENT.
It Is a matter of keen gratification to be
enabled to state that the labor movement of
Canada has advanced and is progressing, keep
ing full Dace with the movement of the re
ma'nder of fie American continent. At the
recent congress held in Montreal the officers
were enabled to report an increase In the
membership of the unions of IKKB over the
preceding year; that there waa then in exist
ence In Canada 1567 local unions. V,Â« have
continued the- salaried ,oixanixer. for Canada
exclusively and also-.tfee corps of volunteer
organizers and have contributed from our funds
the annual gTatot of *50o for. legislative pur
poses to the Dominion Trades and Lebor Con
gress. The congress, I have been advised, was
entirely harmonious and successful in Its work
and has honored us by electing as Its fra
ternal delegate Its former president and our
general orcanlzer. John A. Flett. .
In my lam report I took occasion to refer
to a number of detail matters in connection
with the labor movement of Canada affiliated
to that of the United States which, though
appropriate to-day, need not be . recounted
here, but simply referred to as a matter of
information and continuity. I am pleased to
add that the kindly and fraternal relations
heretofore existing have been cultivated to the
fullest and. If popsible. been more firmly
cemented. Let us hope and work to the end
that an time goes on, we may be heluful to
each other In every way to further the com
mon Interests of the workers of both countries.
The nÂ«mber of unions in Porto Rico di
rectly affiliated to the American Federation
of Labor the first of the- year were 1 Insular
or State organization. 3 centrals, 7 locals,
making a total of 11. September 30. 19W. there
were affiliated 1 Insular or State organization,
4 centrals 38 locals, making a total of 43.
In addition to the above Organizer Igleslas
reports that forty- two locals were onwntzed
and attached to the international unions dur
ing the twelve months. A comparison of the
flcures and dates shows that a large majority
of these unions were organized after my visit
to Porto Rico. \
The people of Porto Rico are intensely
sympathetic with the institutions of our re
public and universally desire the recognition of
the principle* of equality with the sovereign
citizenship of the United States. These rights
they are eminently qualified to exercise; these
rights they are entitled to. and it should be
our aim to aid them in achieving them.
Porto Rico literally translated into English
words reads "Port of Riches," the name given
by a monarch of Spain. Now the misnomer
of their Island mocks the people In their grim
and grotesque misery.
I strongly urge that every effort be made,
not only by this convention, but also by every
union, union member and sympathizer, to
help to the very best of his ability the worthy
workers of Porto RJco to a realization of a
better and brighter day.
WORK OF ORGANIZING.
Tho union shop in no sense Involves a denial
of the right of every man to sell his labor as
he may see fit, nor the employer to hire such
labor. In fact, it is an affirmative to that
rtght. Employers have the lawful right to hire
any labor they may choose, but it does not give
them the right to impress workmen or to en
slave them, or to drag them Into a factory
on any terms the employer may choose to
grant as an expression of his â¢"kindliness."
Employers have the right to make contracts
for labor. This right carries with It, also, the
same rights of the workmen. It. therefore, fol
lows that If the workers have the right to sell
their labor as they see fit, they also have the
right NOT to sell It to employers, unless It
be. through the collective bargain of the union
shop. As an illustration. I recently asserted
that every man has the right to say, "'I will
not work for you unless you make a contract
with the union to which I belong and agree
to emrloy none but members of that union.
To claim that he may not say this Is equiva
lent to saying that he must sell his labor, not
as he sees fit. but as the employer sees fit.
Can any reasonable answer be made, or criti
cism indulged in, when employers find it to
their advantage to make a contract with a
reputable body of men to employ union labor
exclusively and thus eliminate the possibility
of strikes, disputes, factions and losses? To
this our opponents, the so-called citizens al
liances can make no answer. Their policy
consists of evasion and willful misrepresenta
tion of the alms and purposes of organized
labir of the collective bargain, of the working
agreement, of the union shop.
The open- shop cant and hypocrisy aim at
organized labor with the full knowledge that
it. and it alone, stands between the tollers
with those dependent upon them and the
greed and avarice that would force down the
conditions of labor to a bare subsistence,
lengthen the hours of daily toll and make the
home wretched and desolate.
The division and subdivision of labor and Its
specialization, brought about by Inventions of
machines and new tools of labor, have robbed
workmen of their power of individual freedom
of contract with their employers. Their only
opportunity for anything- . like fair or advan
tageous terms under which to sell their labor
Is in associating themselves with their fellow
workmen in making a collective bargain, a
working agreement; in other words, a union
and a contract by the union with employers
for their labor and the conditions under which
it shall be sold.
an employer and a union Is for members of
the union to furnish that employer with labor
of certain qualifications for a specific period
of time, the consideration being the payment
of stipulated wares as a minimum. That
others are by their own short-sighted policy
or Indifference excluded from the provisions
and benefits of such an agreement is their
own fault and against which they have neither
the legal nor the moral right to contend. â¢
The organized labor movement is the asso
ciated effort of more than two million of adult
wealth producers. It is the unselfish action
of the most lntellicent and the earnest mani
festation of the most enlightened self-interest
which seen that interest best served by help
ing to protect and promote the Interests of
others. ' .

Takes Notice of the Open Shop
In former periods when an Industrial reaction was manifest, em
ployers generally viewed the situation from their own Immediate
standpoint only, without regard to their own broad Interest or the
general good. Their first recourse was to that which to them seemed
the easiest course to continue the operation of their plantsâ to find
markets. They reduced wages. Reduction of wages followed In quick
order; the consuming power of the masses was curtailed and still more
'limited, pnt-niHng wholesale discharges of workmen who were formerly
employed In producing the things the masses, the workers, formerly
consumed, inducing and giving the further cause to still further cur

CHICAGO, Nov. 14. â Miss Isadore
Rush, who was drowned at San Diego,
was well known to Chicago theater
goers. Her last appearance tiere was
in "Florodora" at McVicker's Theater,
in December of last year. In June of
1902 she rose to stellar rank in this city,
when she succeeded Edna Wallace
Hopper as Lady Holyrood . in "Floro
dora" at the Illinois Theater- She was
reckoned on* of the most' popular and
gifted of the lesser theatrical lights who
Miss Rush was born in Wilkesbarre,
Pa., about thirty-eight years ago. She
was married some years ago to a Mr.
White, who was not a theatrical man,
and ehe has a daughter upon the stage
known as, Miss Maud White; who is
now married to Tyron Power, who re
cently made a hit in "Robert Emmett."
Miss Rush also leaves a mother, who is
ill at the home of the actress at Morn
ing Side Heights. New York, and a sis
ter, Carrie Rush, who is- with their
mother.
The supposition is that Miss Rush
while battling with the breakers suf
fered an attack of heart failure, which
rendered her helpless and caused her to
drown.
The sea dur&g the past few days has
been unusually high, and, was danger
ouf even for the mftst practiced swim
mer. Mi?s Rush had the reputation of
being something of an athlete and had
taken much interest in sports of all
kinds. She was a fair Bwlmmer, but
even the most proficient man would
have had difficulty with the surf that
was running this afternoon.
Notwithstanding these unfavorable
conditions Miss Rush. Wilton Heriot. a
leading member of the company; Miss
Olney, a niece of former Secretary Ol
rey. and several others plunged into
the surf. Shortly afterward Miss Rush
and Hc-riot were swimming at a point
about midway between the old pier,
Just below the hotel, and the bathhouse,
when suddenly a huge breaker broke
over Miss Rush, who was some distance
from Heriot. The undertow caught the
ectress, and notwithstanding her fran
tic efforts to regain her feet and battle
with the waves she was swept out to
ward the sea. Heriot immediately per
ceived her peril, and hurried to her as
sistance.
H. B. Smith and wife and Fred Jaffa,
ail of whom are residents of San Diego,
were strolling on the beach and were
witnesses of the accident. They imme
diately rushed to the assistance of
Heriot, who was battling desperately
to save Miss Rush. *.* *
Within a few minutes the actresfl* in
fijilmate body was brought ashore by
Smith and Jaffa. They also* brought
Heriot, who was unconscious, to th>
shore. The actor was revived after a
few minutes, but the efforts to bring
the 'actress back to life seemed unavail
ing. Word had been sent to the hotel
for assistance, and Dr- Lorini, the
hotse physician, quickly . responded.
Won! was also sent to Dr. Goff, and
within a few minutes he too arrived on
the scene. The two physicians labored
over the unfortunate actress for more
than an hour, but in vain.
BAN DIEGO. Nov. 14.â While bathing
in the surf this afternoon Miss Isadore
Rush, the well-known actrets and the
star of the "Glittering Gloria" company,
â¢which was billed to appear at the Isis
Theater to-nigrht, was -caught by a
mammoth breaker and swept out to
eea. Several persons hastened to her
ecsiÂ£tancÂ« and she was brought ashore
unconscious.. Two physicians were
promptly at hand and they exerted
every known means to resuscitate Miss
Rush. Once or twice there were faint
signs of returning vitality, but these
proved deceptive, and shortly after 4
o'clock the actress was pronounced
dead.

DENVER, Colo., Nov. 14. â The of
ficial canvass of the votes cast last
Tuesday is in progress and has been
completed in but a few counties. Re
vision of the unofficial returns leaves
Alva Adams' majority over Governor
James H. Peabody not less- than
10,000.
"We consider Governor Peabody*s
threat to contest the election a mere
bluff," said Democratic Chairman
Milton Smith to-day, "but we are
watching everything. I estimate that
Adams' plurality will be 11,000. Our
returns show that he carried Denver
by 5100 and the rest of the State by
as much more. The official count in
the counties where it has been com
pleted gives Adams a gain. If this
gain continues as the official count in
the rest of the counties takes place
Adams will have a plurality of
11,000."*
Chairman D. B. Fairley of the Re
publican State Central Committee said
to-day: "I estimate that when our re
turns are all in Governor Peabody will
be but a trifle over 500 behind. He
has been showing wonderful strength
In the past few days and has cut down
the majority against him greatly. We
are satisfied that he was the victim
of a conspiracy and intend contesting
every ground. We have positive evi
dence that the fraudulent votes
throughout the State will run as high
aa 15.000. We intend having all the
fraudulent votes thrown out and this
will show Peabody has been elected
by a large majority." .
NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â The storm
which swept up through the Atlantic
Btates from the gulf Saturday and last
night developed into a gale of hurri
cane force as it moved up resulted in
the most complete tie-up of wire comr
munication that the East has expe
rienced since the memorable snowstorm
of 1888, disarranged, train schedules,
paralyzed trolley lines and piled sev
eral wrecks along the coast.
The downpour of rain and heavy
snow which accompanied the storm
added to the destructive force of the
gale. Telephone and telegraph poles,
borne down by the weight of snow and
ice-incrusted wires, gave way before the
sweep of the wind, and whole sections
of country were cut off. Both the tele
graph companies and the telephone
companies with long-distance wires to
day reported their fields of operations
restricted to th^ territory bounded on
the west by Philadelphia, on the east
by Boston and on the north by New
burgh, N. Y.
The big brokerage concerns in Wall
etreet, many of whom under normal
conditions operate thousands of miles
of wire, to-day found themselves prac
tically helpless. The exchanges were
no more fortunate, and the only quota
tions received from Chicago and New
Orleans were the market reports of the
Associated Press.
By an elaborate system of relays and
the use of both telephone and telegraph
wires the Associated Press succeeded
in bridging the path cut by the storm
and reached all points in the West,
North and East with the exception of
a small section In the vicinity of Al
bany. There the damage from the snow
and wind seemed beyond immediate re
pair, and with the exception of trains
there was no communication with that
section during the day. t
The general breakdown of wires was
also responsible for trouble on the rail
roads. The movements of trains could
not be reported, and delays extending
into hours in many cases resulted.
That no more disasters at sea result-
ed from the gale probably was due to
the early warning of the approaching
hurricane sent out by the Weather Bu
reau. Bulletins sent out Saturday aft
ernoon told of the gale that would
sweep the coast an* cautioned all mar
iners against leaving: port. . -
Two trusties and a. keeper employed
on Hikers Island during the storm start
ed in a small boat from the island to
One Hundred and Thirty-eighth street
to get the New York keepers. After
considerable work they managed to get
out into the river, the wind
seemed to Increase, and the. three men
were unable to reach the mainland,
the boat being swept down the river to
South Brother Island, where it was
beached. The whereabouts of the men
was unknown until to-day, and it was
feared that they had been drowned.

: crime or unlawful conduct. We love liberty
j and Justice; we revere the Institutions, the
I history and the traditions of our republic; the
: blush of shame Burmounts our faces ar.fl our
1 sense of honor and dignity rises in protest
I acalnst so foul a blot that a recreant public
officer, creature and puppet of sordid greed
should have so besmirched and defiled the
proud record and honored name of a sovereign
State.
It woÂ« the evident purpose of that unholy
combination of the Citizens'. Alliance with
Governor Peabody to destroy the Independence
and manhood of the workmen of Colorado by
j making an ' attack urrrn the effort to destroy
orsanlird labor of the State. Their declara
tion that their attack was not directed at the
American Federation of Labor is disproved
by their bitter antagonism to and asault upon
I the affiliated coal miners of that State. That
j they will fall In their destructive tactics, aye,
! that they have already failed. Is evident from
the fart that there are more workmen or
ganized In Colorado to-day than at any time
in Its previous history; that organizations
formerly Jn rivalry with each other ;iave
amalgamated, and a greater bond of unity and
fraternity has been effected.
COURT PROCEEDINGS.
By direction of the executive council I pre
pared and Issued a circular to our affiliated
unlon.w appealing for financial aid, so that the
officers of the Weatern Federation of Miners
might have the means to brinz before the
highest Federal courts of our country the
assertion and the test of the natural and
constitutional questions and right Involved In
the outrageous conduct of Colorado's officials.
We are firmly of the opinion that the highest
Judicial tribunal of our country will Inevi
tably reverse a~ course â¢ so destructive of the
â¢ very fundamental principles upon which our
republic Is based.
We urse upon our fellow workmen' still
greater unity and federation. They should
not only Insist upon the punishment of the
wrongdovra, the officials who have so vio
lently denied the rood name of that State,
but they must Insist upon an effective eight
hour law, and better than all, be so united In
numbera, purpose and spirit a* to Inaugurate
and enforce for themselves the eight-hour
workday. . '
May we not also entertain the hope that
inasmuch as unity and associated effort are
recognized as essential to the well being and
progress ot the workers of our country the
lesion so costly learned may brlns the
metalliferous miners and all other International
unions In closer affiliation and brotherhood
under the banner of the American Federation
of Labor?

SAX JOSE. Nov. 14. â George E.
letcher, the capitalist, who was ar
rested last night for arson alleged to
have been committed in Ohio some
years ago, appeared in Justice Ben
con's court this morning- for arraign
ment. He was accompanied by his
son, Clarence E. Letcher, and Attor
r.<5'S J. B. Kerwin and W. H. John
eon. District Attorney Campbell ap
peared for the prosecution. At the
rtquest of the latter arraignment was
postponed until Wednesday morning.
owing to th*> fact that it was desired
to have Attorney C. G. Nagle of San
Francisco present. The latter was
largely instrumental in Letcher's ar
rest. The accused has been released
on 520,000 bondf, his wife and son go
ing security.
L-etcher treats his arrest lightly. He
â¢will make a determined fight to pre
vent extradition. He lays his arrest
to ppite work. He owns a. large num-
I'T of slot machines, which he has
placed about town, and intimates his
arrest is due to a rival slot machine
concern. To-day he made the follow
ing statement:
"I am entirely innocent of the
charge against me. If I was guilty
they would not have waited until now
to arrest me, as the alleged crime was
committed many years ago. I was
back in Oh5o five years ago and they
irade no attempt to detain me. My
identity has not been concealed and
ihe-y could have found me at any time.
1 have no fear of the outcome, but re
gret the publicity and disgrace."
A divorced wife is also blamed for
the arrest.
Letcher is well known about the city
nnd his arrest has caused a sensation.
He is reputed to be worth $100,000.
For a number of years Letcher con
ducted a lunch counter at the broad
gEupe depot. He now owns a cigar
stand in that vicinUy and lately built
a large fiat building on Market street.
Clarence Letcher, a son, conducts a
large automobile shop in this city and
lately won a number of automobile
prizes at Del Monte.
The police state that an officer is on
the way here from Ohio to take
Lttcher back. The prosecution is said
to be backed by a number of insurance
companies that claim he has defrauded
them in many fires.
PROMINENT 5 AN JO6E CAPITALIST. WHO WAS ARRESTED SUNDAY ON
CHARGE THAT HE WAS INDICTED FOR ARSON BY AN OHIO GRAND
JU/IY MANY YEARS AGO. AND WHO SAYS HE IS VICTIM OF SPITE,
They would not only divert our attention
from the effort at economic Improvement to a
defense against every species of civil suits
brought by our opponents against any officer
of organized labor, but they would make every
effort "under the. forms of law" to mulct our
unions in damages for supposed Injurious re
sults from trade union action. We would be
forced to defend suits without regard to the
merit or lack of merit In the complaint in or
der to prevent our organization from being
mulct*d In damages; and this, after all, is
the ultimate desire and purpose of our op
ponents for trade union Incorporation, for ne
cessity would require the expenditure of large
sums nf money In attorneys' : tees and other
co"<t8 and expenditures incident to litigation.
The most important point, apparently, urged
by our opponents In advocacy of trade union
Incorporation Is, as they claim, that employers
have tangible property and In any violation of
terms of agreement or breach of contract they
arÂ« responsible, and In cases of breach of con
tract on their part they can be held In dam
ages nnd ' payment enforced, while labor or
ganizations, not having tangible property, they
say. are unincorporated bodies, and violation
of contract by them would not afford the same
facilities for bringing them within the Jurls-
We still frequently hear the proposition
ur?ed for the incorporation of trade unions,
the evident purpose of many advocates being
honorable and sympathetic, notwithstanding
how, unwise and Injurious the results would
unquestionably be to labor. Others, again,
who advocate and Insist upon the Incorpora
tion of the trade unions know full well the
purpose they have In view and the schemes
they could then hatch to harass organized
labor still more with suits at law, regariiess
of the fllmslness of the cause or the pretext
for civil rults.
FIGHTS INCORPORATION*.
As. rational men we understand that it Is
impossible to remove all the Ills or impedi
ments at once from our national life and
progress, and fcr that reason we apply our
selves to the natural and gradual process ot
elimination and construction. It Is for this
reason, therefore, that the convention of the
American Federation of Labor advocates th?

dum, for Its establishment will gtve oppor

tion.
"Imperialism," of protection and free trade,
as there was of gold and silver and other im
portant questions too numerous to enumerate;
yet the people have no alternative but to vote
for one or th" other of thÂ» parties, regardless
of. how distasteful many of the propositions in
their platforms may be to them. The party
successful at the polls takes for granted that
not only Its position but every proposition
that It Has put forth In Its platform and
every action that It has taken has received
the Indorsement of the people.

SECRETARY'S REPORT.
Of course, employers entering 1 Into contrac
tual relations with business men and com
mitting a breach thereof are liable to dam
agf3. This also applies where employers enter
into contractual relations with workmen for
labor for a specific period. Wit In spite of the
innumerable violations of contract entered into
by employers and organized workmen, we
challenge the advocates of compulsory Incor
poration to point out a single Instance in
which employers have beÂ»n. or how they could
have been, mulcted In damages for violation
of the terms of an agreement with labor In
its collective capacity. This Is referred to. not
as Justification of or an encouragement to an
organized labor breach of contract. On the
contrary It Is the constant aim of our move
ment to Instill upon the minds of all our fel
low workers to brins about workinff agTe-
mer.ts with employers and to a faithful ad
herence to the spirit and letter of their terms,
but this is cited to prove the fallacy of the
latest pretense urged by our opponents for
trade union incorporation.
In previous reports and elsewhere have been
clearly met the various specious arguments set
forth from time to time of those who, under
the euphonious guise of trade union incorpora
tions hide their real purpose. In our time
and In connection with our movement, a
repetition of the confiscation of the funds of
the old - time workmen's guilds. We will not
submit to this new snare for labor's despoil
ment.

for breaches of . contract and that, therefore,
the unions should be Incorporated to bring
about equality of responsibility. The chief
merit In this claim Is that It has no founda
tion in fact or In practice.

The Increase in the defense, fund for local
trade and federal labor unions from 5"v5.."WÂ« 4O
on October 1. 190.1. to $Sl.nt> 95 On October 1.
1904 Is mc*t satisfactory when you consider
that $15.97-. I*"?* $56Â«> returned, was paid dvrr
tng the year to members on strike In the va
rious unions. The. fund Is ample to support
members on strike for an indefinite period.
The average membership of the local unions
has decreased during the past year from S2..S0O
to 55 257. This Is due. in part, to the forma
tion of affiliated local unions into nine intÂ«i
natlonal organization* There were 352 local
unions Instructed to Join the newly formed
International organizations.
An unusual number cf unions were suspend
ed for non-payment of per capita tax by the
three months' limit being strictly enforced.
The laws governing the distribution of thÂ»
defense fund are ample, but I strongly advise,
against amendments which would permit a
union chartered IÂ»-9s than cne year to receive
â¢trike benefits. The requirement that members
of a local union should have a continuous mem
bership of one year to be entitled to stnkÂ«
benefits should not be Interfered with. If
either, or both, of the above requirements were
amended It would endanger the stabi'.Ly t.l
the defense fund and encourage newiy orsfan-
Ized unions to enter Into hasty and ill advlsd
strikes. The number of strikes this ye;Â»r
has been greater than heretofore. An unasuat
number of settlements were made through thu
agency of the paid organizers. The fao'. that

LONDON, Nov. 15. â The subscrip
tion list for the New Japanese loan
will be closed at noon to-day, being
already covered several times, though
it i-s understood that applications
have been nothing like so great as for
the previous issue.
NEW YORK, Nov. 14. â Subscrip
tions to the American half of the new
$60,000,000 Japanese loan, which
opened here to-day, are coming in
extensively, according to a statement
issued by Kuhn, Loeb & Co.. who are
financing the loan in conjunction with
the National City Bank and the Na
tional Bank of Commerce. There is
little doubt that appUcations will ex
ceed the total amotfnt. Preference
will be given to small subscribers.
Applications from out of town are
said to be especially numerous.
isFUed in a labor dispute for which thete is
nrt already a law upon the statute books and
for which a proper penalty l 8 not provided.
Thos-e acts for which workmen are enjoined
for which there Is no penalty provided are not
unlawful, and, therefore, an injunction should
not be Issued .enjoining men ,trom doing the
things they have a lawful right to do.
We reiterate ami emphasize the declaration
that we have no desire to be Immune for the
conimist-toii of any unlawful acts, for we dis
ccuntenanee and denounce them and recognize
their commission as wrongful and prejudicial
to our own interests as well as to the public
good. Hut we must insist that if any man
connected with our movement be charged with
an unlawful act he ehould. like any other
man, be put unon his defense and before a
jury of his peers meet his accusers and abide
by the verdict rendered.
We protest against the class distinction made
in these cases, so far hÂ« "they apply to labor,
which even upon an ex parte allegation of
our opponents renders a workman punishable
for an act which ia held as perfectly lawful
when committed by others. Surely we have
the right to demand the constitutional guaran
tee of equality liefore the law. This guarantyÂ©
is IwMng dally violated by injunctions. If labor
is but true to itself, if we but more thoroughly
organize our fellow workers, become more
. steadfast and true to the great cause of labor,
we shall force home upon our opponents as
well as politicians and recreant statesmen the
demand for that i protection. Justice and fail
cValing to which we are entitled.
; Our eight-hour bill was introduced In the
Senate by Senator L.. E. McComas of Mary
land and in the House by Congressman R. It.
Hitt of Illinois. Extensive hearings were had
or. the bill before the Senate Committee on
j Education and I^bor and the House Com
j rr.ittee on I^abor. As the hearings upon this
Mil before the committees In previous Con
: glasses were . so extensive and are In print
. we decided, therefore, not to present any
: further argument until our opponents had con
cluded.
The opposition followed their usual tactics
of procrastination and of prolonging the hear
ings. ThÂ» legislative committee. Vice Presi
dents Duncan. O'Connell and myself, rebutted
tht' statements and arguments of our opponents
j and Insisted that there should be neither waste
j of time nor the report of the committee de
[ ferred. We were ' Justified In believing that
: Inasmuch as both committees of Congress had
reported this bill favorably at several pre
; vlcus Congress's there ought to have been no
â¢ further delay. To our disappointment the
. House committee acquiesced in the proposition
. of our opponents and referred to the Depart
i ment of Commerce and Labor an Investigation
of the subject by reaolutiona.^ '_ _
chixese"excx,usion'.
\ In the early part of the year It was learned
that the Chinese Government had given six
months' notice of Its desire that Its treaty
with thÂ» United States covering Chinese im
'_ migration should terminate. That the condi
. tlon which we contended two years ago would
exist, should the Chinese Government denounce
thr. treaty, was plainly apparent; that is, that
there was neither law nor treaty that would
I in any way limit, restrict or prohibit the free
entry of Chinese into the United States and
, Its possessions. We Immediately brought this
I to the attention of Congr-ss, particularly
1 through the aid of Senator Patterson of C'olo
j rado and Congressman Llvernash cf Callfor
j nla. The question 'arouwd intense Interest.
; and though the condition which presented Itself
wai denied and contended against by many,
an investigation ot the subject by a Congres
sional committee, and pressing home the facts
I In the case, resulted in the passage of an
' amendment to tne general deficiency bill rem
j edying the defect.
Â¦ As the ttrst Intimation that the Chinese
I Government had denounced the treaty came
j from a "leak" in the State Department, so
I has there recently b*en published a statement
j that there Is now being negotiated between
i representatives of our Government and that of
â¢ China a new treaty, which. It is said, will deal
j "more liberally" with the subject of Chinese
, immigration.
I Inasmuch as experience nas demonstrated
that the largest number of Chinese laborers
and coolies have been brought to this country
I under the pretense that they were "merchants
and KtudfiitM," and inasmuch aÂ» any treaty
which may be made will. take precedence over
and supplant any law upon the statute books,
It will bo well for us to manifest In no uncer
tain manner our determined and unalterable
opposition to any move calculated in the. re
motest degree to render us liable to the_dan
ger of Chinese Immigration, an immigration
which has been fraught with peril to every
people with which it has come in contact.
â¢ Our Immigration department recognlze3 and
declares the difficulties now experienced with
an effective law In enforcing Its provision? for
Chines** exclusion. Surely, then, nothing
i should be done by treaty, law or regulation to
lessen the effectiveneps to the bar ag-ainnt this
overwhelming Hentiment and conviction ot all
our people.
CONVICT LABOR.
Though little progress has been made In se
curing an effective Federal law against convict
labor coming Into competition with free labor,
a beginning has been made in the recognition
of that principle by Congress In one department
of the Government. In an amendment to the
postoftlce â¢ appropriation bill the following was
adopted :
"Provided, that hereafter no contract shall
be entered into by the Postofflce Department
for purchase of material or supplies to be
manufactured by convict labor."
The same provision should be pressed Into
enactment bo as to apply to all the depart
ments of the Government.
' Apart from our efforts to aid in the exten
sion of the principle that noÂ« convict labor
nhall enter Into competition with free
labor In the several States, we should endeavor
to secure a Federal law that shall prohibit the
pioducts ot convict labor In one State coming:
into competition with free labor of such States
as have provided themselves with wise, benefi
cent and protective legislation upon this sub
ject. We recognize the unwisdom, aye, even
the brutality of permitting convicts to serve
out their terms In Idleness. â¢ The States which
have solved this problem of convict labor best.
New York and Pennsylvania, are clear demon
strations that, from the standpoint of economy
and the public welfare, the prisoners' good,
l>oth while Incarcerated and thereafter. Is pro
moted to the highest degree by some form of
work.
' XATIONAIi ARBITRATION.
A so-called national arbitration bill was In-,
troduced In Congress, which, upon the face of
it, appeared to be a voluntary measure, yet
trie hearings developed the fact thai in the
Iast ; analysis It would be a species of com
pulsory . compliance I with the award. Â¦ Our
movement Is sincerely In favor of the arbitra
tion, of disputes which cannot be determined
otherwise; but we are strongly committed
I against the policy of compulsory arbitration In
any form, particularly compulsory arbitration
â¢by the State. When conciliation . falls, we
favor voluntary arbitration with employers,
and If necessary a disinterested party as Â¦ an
arbitrator. We emphatically declare the ne
cessity for faithful compliance with the. terms
and awards made by such arbitration; but we
are equally Insistent that the arbitration shall
be voluntarily entered Into and voluntarily and
faithfully fulfilled. â¢ '
Tbera Is no doubt that of the Ills of our
governmental life not one is more prejudicial
to the interests of the people than our present
political partisan form of determining the peo
ple's Judgment. Apart from the corruption in
cident thereto Is the fact that political par
ties are Â«ru!lty of larger or minor offenses
against the Interests ot the people, or are more
or less indifferent to their constantly growing
need. The political . party system deprives '
the people of the opportunity of .manifesting I
their Judgment upon- great and Important pub- I
Ho questions. There can be no question but '
that there Is an overwhelming sentiment
among the people for an eight hour day on '
work for the Government ; for the restriction
or abolition of the abuse, of thÂ« writ of in- '
junction. There 'Is a well-defined diversity â¢ of
opinion ot the policy of expansion or so-callej
The latest report from the ranch
this forenoon stated that ten elk had
been shipped, five had died from ex
haustion after being run down and
one had been lost in the hills. An ex
ptrt cattleman stated to-day that if
the present methods are pursued it
will require a force of 1500 vaqueros
to accomplish the work.
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 14.â After
two days' work by thirty-five expert
Vaqueros the attempt to corral' the
herd of 150 elk now at large on the
Miller & Lux ranch, near this city,
and to transport them to the Govern
ment reservation ha.s been abandoned
and other plans are being made by
those in charge to accomplish the
work of transportation.
GOMPERS MAKES REPORT,
All agree that outside of the fact
that he has a somewhat careworn ex
pression, the Pope, notwithstanding
his recent attack of gout, seems to be
in good health.
Immediately after the secret con
sistory the Pope held a semi-public
consistory, preliminary to the cere
mony of the canonization of Blessed
Alessandro Sauli. the Barnabite, and
Blessed Gerardo Mallla, the Redemp
tprist. which will take place next
month.
The Pontiff entered the hall of the
consistory surrounded by his imme
diate entourage, flanked by the noble
and Swiss guards and followed by the
papal court. He seated himself 'on
the throne and those present advanced
to pay their homage, after which the
Pope delivered a prayer to the Holy
Ghost. Following this all except the
Cardinals left the hall, as the con
sistory was secret. The Pope and Car
dinals then proceeded to proclaim the
Archbishops, Bishops, etc., as already
appointed by brief.
The majority of the Cardinals pres
ent considered the allusion rather
mild and remarked that the Pope
omitted the part upon which he pre
viously had consulted several of the
Cardinals, in- which he was to have
appealed to the people of France and
to have urged them to be loyal to the
church and use their rights as citizens
to prevent the Government from per
secuting religion.
ROME, Nov. 14.â The festivities in
honor of the jubilee of the Immacu
late Conception began to-day with the
holding of a brilliant consistory, which
was especially interesting, as the Pope
lately had been indisposed and many
persons wished to be assured of his
recovery. All the Cardinals living in
Rome, numbering about twenty-five,
gathered in the hall of the consistory
at the Vatican half an hour before the
ceremony, taking their places in three
groups and making one of those im
posing pictures oniy to be seen at the
apostolic palace.
The United States was represented
ot the 'consistory by Monseigneur Ken
nedy, rector of the American College
here, and Monseigneur Setton, titular
Archbishop of Heliopolis, ot Jersey
City, N. J. Monseigneur Kennedy at
the private consistory received the
pallium for Archbishop CJlennon of St.
Louis. The pallium for Archbishop
Moeller of Cincinnati was received in
the secret consistory by Father Haver,
private secretary of Cardinal Gotti.
l-'refect of the Propaganda, and the
pallium for Archbishop Messmer of
Milwaukee was received by Mon
seigneur Jauquet.
In the secret consistory the Pope de
livered an allocution recalling the
origin of the concordat and the rea
sons which induced Pope Pius VII to
conclude it with Napoleon, especially
referring to the provisions made for
the appointment of Bishops, the bud
get of the Ministry of Public Worship,
which was regulated by what was
practically a contract, and finally the
free exercise of Catholic worship. He
added that the so-called "organic
articles" added in 1802 by Napoleon
had never been recognized by the Holy
See, either as law as being part of
the concordat. Therefore the Pontiff
deplored the fact that the present Gov
ernment of the French republic had
under various pretexts charged the
Holy See with not having observed the
concordat, adding that the church had
never in the case of any country
broken an agreement made.
The Pope concluded with saying
that the French Government had
broken the fundamental conditions of
the concordat. He complained of the
impossibility, due to the existing state
of affairs, of appointing Bishops to the
vacant sees in France, but expressed
the hope that an understanding would
be reached.
Shortly after the Nevada Bank opened
for business yesterday morning people
began to present their bids. The num
ber of applications was much greater
than expected. Many wanted only $500
in bonds, others asked for thousands of
dollars' worth of the securities.
Each bid to be considered must be ac
companied by a certified check. The
bonds sell at 88 and pay Interest at ( 3
per cent on the par value, which
amounts to more than 7 per cent on the
amount to be paid. Investors are se
cured by a second charge on the Japa
nese customs. President Hellman of the
Nevada Bank said yesterday:
We have received applications for more than
fOOO.OOn .worth of the bond3 since this morn
ing. The number of investors and the amount
subscribed greatly exceed our expectations. We
thought we .ihiitiM not have many bids until
to-morrow, when we shall have had time to
hear from ths interior and big concerns.
It looks as if we. should have a btfr share
of the Investment here in Fan Francisco. I
cannot say how great a part of the bonds we
shall be allowed to handle, but subscribers
will get a pro rata share If -there is an over
subscription, as it is believed there will be.
The tfrms ore advantaseous and the bonds
are well secured. We are more than satis
lied with result?.
?
LONDON AND NEW YORK EAGER
The first day's bidding for the Japa
nese bonds showed that the moneyed
people of San Francisco have every
confidence in the credit of the little
brown men who are battling against
the hosts of his imperial Majesty, the
Czar. Within five hours after the time
appointed for the sending of applica
tions the subscriptions amounted to
more than $900,000.

Burglars Enjoy Ohampaene.
OAKLAND, Nov. 14. â The Brigh
ton saloon, owned by W. E. Disher
Â«nd J. F. McVey, was entered by bur
glars early this morning. While only
a small amount of money was taken
by the thieves, considerable damage
was done In the place. The burglars
attempted to force the safe, but after
breaking the knob of the combina
tion they gave up that plan and turned
their attention* to the cash register and
slot machines, securing in all about
530. After ransacking the place -they
took half a dozen bottles of cham
pagne, four bottles of whisky, and a
l>ox of cigars to the back room and
drank the wine there. Had they suc

As to the story told by Campbell
that on the night of the shooting she
told him that "She had a gun as good
as his," Mrs. Campbell says that it is
absolutely false; that she merely told
him that she would not return to him
and asked him to leave the house.
She says on one occasion since the
divorce Campbell had attempted to
beat her because' she refused to live
with him again.
Dr. R. T. Stratton. who is attend
ing Mrs. Campbell, said her condition
was somewhat improved to-day and
that unless blood poisoning should set
In 'she had an excellent chance for re
covery. The surgeon fears, however,
that the rusty corset steel, which was
driven into her chest ahead of the bul

of saving Mrs. Campbell's life.

"The prosecuting officers will be ready
with a strong case against Kiniry. It
seems to me that the Oakland police
should send a man to Los Angeles at
once to be at hand at all times until he
shall be ready to return to Oakland
with Kiniry."
Chief Hodgking has made no move
toward sending a man south. He has
been too, busy with the scandalous ex
posures in his department.
Not only did Smith affirm this state
ment on his deathbed at the Receiving
Hospital, but he said It to Captain of
Police W. J. Petersen and to others be
fore his last words were taken for use
should his murderer be captured. Leach
said to-day: '
In preparation for the trial of David
Klniry. the Los Angeles burglar, who
Is charged with the murder of Police
man James H. Smith of Oakland, Pros
ecuting Attorney A. P. Leach began
to-day to frame" the case he will present
against the notorious housebreaker.
Leach declares his belief that he will
be able to establish a perfect chain of
circumstantial as well as considerable
direct testimony to connect Kiniry with
the slaying.
Much of the evidence is contained in
the testimony that was taken at the
Coroner's inquest in the case of Frank
Goldstein, Kinlry's companion, who
was killed by Patrolman Smith when
the fatal three-cornered duel occurred,
a year ago. But there Is more incrim
inating detail that is being carefully
studied. Attorney Leach gives Police
man Smith's dying statement an Im
portant place in the light of Kinlry's
admission that he Was with Goldstein
the night of the shooting. Kiniry has
asserted that Goldstein, and not him
self, shot Smith. Against that declara
tion will be the dying words of the of
ficer:
"The man I shot was not the man
who shot me."

BERKELEY, Nov. 14.â Tha struggle
between Captain J. T. Nance, military
instructor at the University of Cali
fornia, and the riotous members of the
senior class Is rapidly approaching a
climax and thirty-nine members of that
class have been notified by the captain
that their explanations as to their con
nection with the recent outbreak Is un
satisfactory. This means that thess
seniors cannot graduate unless they
meet Captain Nance's requirements.
This is about one-half of the class and
neither Captain Nance nor the seniors
are apparently inclined to give in.
The members of the senior class were
Instructed last week to give their ex
planations â¢ of tho riot to Captain
Nance. Most of the"* members of tha
class informed the instructor that they
could not get into the classroom "be
cause of the crowd." Captain Nance
to-day called the entire class 'before
him and declined to accept this ex
planation. Each member of .the class
was presented with a sheet of paper
containing the formal charges against
him and at the bottom Captain Nance
had noted by the word "satisfactory"
or "unsatisfactory" his approval or re
jection of the explanation of the stu
dent. The explanations of forty-one
students were accepted and thirty-nine
were rejected.
Captain Nance informed the class
that if the students specified the indi
viduals of the crowd who prevented
them from entering the classroom the
explanation would be accepted. This
means that Captain Nance is deter
mined to get the names of the ring
leaders and is trying to force the stu
dents to give them.
-It also means that thirty-nine stu
dents will have to explain further or
lose their diplomas and that this num
ber does not include those who are yet
to be disciplined for the riot. Captain
Nance Is ruling the case with the Iron
hand of a strict military man and up
to the present time has been supported
in every move by the authorities.
Prosecution Preparing to
Confront Burglar Kiniry
With Strong Testimony
Captain Nance Not Satisfied
With the Explanations
ot Thirty-Nine Students
Throughout the hearing lurks the
figure of Van Horn, professor and de
tective. The defense say they will
show that he disguised himself as a
Chinese and shadowed his own home.
Mrs. Seibel testified that she found
a Chinese with an umbrella on the
back porch one stormy night. The
case will go on in the morning and it
is expected that to cap the other tes
timony Van Horn will tell of times
and dates in which he has spied upon
his wife.
Mrs. Lizzie Seibel, who weighs 250
pounds and was cook at the boarding
house, testified to having found Knopf
on divers occasions kissing her mis
tress. Miss Josephine Brown, trained
nurse, had seen Mrs. Van Horn, ac
companied by a young man, enter a
lodging-house. the proprietor of
which later identified Mrs. Van Horn
and Knopf as the couple to whom she
had several times rented a room.
The Van Horns have been married
for twenty years and have two chil
dren, a daughter of 18 years and a
son of 14. While Van Horn taught
school at San Rafael his wife con
ducted a student boarding-house at
2222 Bancroft way, Berkeley. One of
the boarders was Adolph Knopf, a
student, 21 years of age. Mrs. Van
Horn is apparently near the fifty-year
mark, tall and spare. She listened to
the testimony against her with a
weary smile.

The only member of the accused four
who has remained In Oakland is Ham
erton. He persists in denials of wrong
doing and says he is ready, to face a
trial. Hamerton continues to declare
that he has repeatedly called the at
tention of Chief Hodgklns to com
plaints that prisoners were robbed by
policemen after they had been taken
into custody.
Chief Hodgkins has referred the
charges against Policeman Frank Sill
to the Police Commissioners. The evi
dence, according to Hodgklns, is very
weak. It was said Sill had been seen
leaving Becker's meat market with a
ham. Sill declares his innocence and
insists the accusation comes from per
sonal enemies.
"W. J. Tobln, who was appointed to fill
one of the vacancies In the department,
has declined the position, being satis
fied to hold his place with the Howard
Company, that pays him $90 a month.
The Police Commissioners will meet
Friday to take further action with re
lation to the situation. Patrolman
Shannon Is being pressed for promotion
to a sergeant's place.
The police attitude is that the evi
dence was gathered not for purposes of
criminal prosecution, but to force the
quartet out of the department. To that
end It is asserted that pressure was put
upon them to compel them to tell the
truth concerning the pllferings. Here
the prosecuting officers say they might
be handicapped should they go to trial
against the four disgraced policemen.
Prosecuting Attorney Leach said to
day: .
I cannot find sufficient evidence to warrant
issuance of complaints against any of the
men. That there Is ample proof, of their
wrongdoing there can be no question, bat this
does not satisfy thÂ« legal requirement con
cerning evidence*.
If anything further Is presented than has
already come to my attention I shall bÂ« very
careful to consider It thoroughly. I am doing
what I consider to be my full duty aa a
prosecuting officer and I shall not flinch.
Harnerton's residence was searched a
few days ago under Chief Hodgklns'
direction, but no evidence was uncov
ered.
Prosecuting Attorney A. P. Leach
has decided that he has not sufficient
evidence upon which to Issue criminal
complaints charging former Sergeant ot
Police Charles E. Clark and dismissed
Policemen J. F. Stahl, L. E. Andrews
and C. W. Hamerton with burglary or
larceny. This decision is not final. City
Attorney J. E. McElroy, who is also
president of the Board of Police and
Fire Commissioners, will hold a con
ference with Attorney Leach to-mor
row. At that meeting the statements of
the witnesses â Sergeant of Police Frank
Lynch, Patrolman Shannon and Spe
cial Policeman Newell Goodwinâ will be
reviewed, as will the written confes
sions of Andrews and Stahl.
As president of the board McElroy
said to-day:
My position concerning tee prosecution of
these man on charge* of theft Is simply this:
I believe the courts should pass upon the evi
dence. If these men are guilty of crime they
should be punished. If they are not guilty. It
seems to me they would Invite prosecution
that their defense might vindicate them.
I have not had an opporunlty as yet to meet
Mr. Leach and Chief Hodgklns la a discussion
concerning the evidence. I have not seen the
confessions, nor have I heard the statements
of all of the witnesses.

Trainer Christie criticized Coach Lan
agan of "Stanford foFcoachlng from the
side lines during the game, declaring
that it was unsportsmanlike and im
proper from any standpoint. He Bug
gested the framing of regulations which
would prevent a repetition of the al
leged infraction of football ethics.
Of the football eleven Force, Lasa
ter. Stern, Snedigar, Kern and Boothe
made short addresses, thanking the
previous speakers for kind words
spoken. Tell Leader Bulkeley spoke
briefly in praise of the rooters and was
received with enthusiasm. He told how
a few plans of the rooters had "gone
agley." The California rooters were
congratulated for the splendid showing
made during thÂ« game.
I knew that I had a hard contract when I
undertook the job this year, but I didn't
stop on that account. We did the best we
could under the conditions, and some of thes*
were Inevitable. Had It not been for Injuries
and disease we should have won. We fought
them to a standstill and when our men gave
way they gave way physloally and not In
spirit. It was only when battered bodies could
do no more that Stanford was able to win.
Hopper made a hit by requesting
that any or all blame be put upon him,
and not on the team, declaring that
death was not too severe a punishment
for a man who should criticize the Cali
fornia team. He spoke in part as fol
lows :
I certainly am not disappointed with the
work of the team. On the other hand I am
absolutely satisfied. It was the most herolo
game I ever saw. Tou ought to kill the man
who dares to criticize the team. If any crit
icism comes It ought to be directed at me. I
can stand it.
In accordance with the customs of
past years, the blue and gold football
enthusiasts gathered on the steps of the
gymnasium at the university this
morning to hold the annual rally fol
lowing the big game with Stanford.
President Wheeler, Coach Hopper,
Trainer Christie and members of the
football team made short speeches.
Hopper has been criticized in various
quarters for his handling of the team
and his Inability to make eleven cham
pions out of green material, but Presi
dent Wheeler utilized the occasion to
give Hopper unusually emphatic praise.
He said:
There never was a team I should have
wished to see win so much as the one that
went down to glorious defeat last Saturday.
It went into the contest Inferior In weight
an.J physical strength to the Stanford team,
and it took grit and spirit to make It tha
equal of Stanford, which feat was done in
the first half. I particularly want to speak
of "Jimmy" Hopper and his magnificent spirit,
spirit which he transferred to his men and
made them light a memorable battle. A team
needs rigid organization and spirit and Hopper
gave the eleven both. What It lacked In
pounds and experience Hopper made up in
spirit, and It was this courage that made It
take the fearful pummeling and meet the trip
hammer of the opposing team. For the sake
of California the eleven played Its hopeless
game like men and revived and closed the con
test gaining ground. There la no fight like
aa uphill fight. I am prouder of that team
than of any other that has upheld the blue
and gold since I have known this university.
I make no excentlons.

This cemmitte* Is fully convinced that with
in easy iÂ»ach of Oakland there Is an abundant
surrly of water of good quality that may be
obtained at a moderate cost. From near the
town cf Pecoto to th* southern boundary of
the county and underneath the alluvial soil
are extensive gravel be<is at varying depths
and sJl carrying great quantities of water. Land
can be purchased at different points, wells
bored and pumped from a common center by
electric rower. The water can be forced Into
a p!r* line and brought to the distributing
system already spoken of. In fact, a lanre
part of the city's present supply and all of
Alameda's snrply comes from such wells at
Alvarado. We believe thtt land can be bought
sufficient for our purposes. wells bored.
Reliable estimate* have been made showing
that consoswrs of water In our city can pay
the bonds necessary for the new plant, both
principal ana Interest, during the forty years
they have to run. and still not pay as high
rates for water as we now pay to the Contra
Cr>FtA Water Company. It will require from
two to thrs* years to construct the works pro
posed by the Bay Cities Water Company.
Of the underground proposition the
committee reports:
Oakland has. therefore, no alternative but
to confctrucl or buy an independent system.
The committee has conF'dered various propo
rtions and has eliminated all but two. The
committee is unanimous in saying that both
Of. these are good and that either plan will
subserve the needs of the city. There Is a
Flight diversity of opinion In the committee
; r to preference, but that Is all. Both plans
contemplated laying by the city of a com
plete distributive system that fhall be mod
ern, up to date and of the very best material.
In addition, the city must erect and main
tain a Dumping slant near the Fruitvale
boundary line for forcing the water to a dis
tributing reservoir at sufficient height. The
cost cf this distributing system, pumping
plant and reservoir will not exceed $2,000,000.
TTiis cost must be added to any estimate of
cost for either of the two plant*.
In detail the committee presents both
proposition*. After showing that the
Bay Cities Company purposes to install
a plant that will supply the city with
at least 20,000,000 gallons of water a
day. to cost 53.750,000. with nearly J2,
000.000 added for a distributing system,
the statement continues:
The price asked by the Bay Cities Water
Company Is, In our opinion, moderate. The
Contra Coata Water Company claims its plant
i* worth more than $7,000,000. This plant has
an old distributive system, pipe lines that
have seen their best flays and a water supply
from lAke Chabot, which Is Itself supplied 5y
creeks running through a settled and agricul
tural country. Its system cannot deliver any
thing like 20.000,000 gallons per day. We do
not believe It can exceed 12,000.000 gallons pÂ«r
day. In the event of a prolonged drought
LsJte Chabot is certain to fall. Adding (2.000.
000 for a Cletributlve system to the $3,750,000
asked by the Bay Cities Water Company
makes a total of $5,750,000. But for that
amount the city Â¦will get a new. first-class dis
tributing system, pumping plants, new pipe
lines and at least 20,000,000 gallons of water
r*r day.
To tUe voter- of Oakland: The City Council
appointed the undersigned a special committee
to lnvestlcate and report upon propositions
presented to It fcr acquiring a water supplj
for the city. After consultation with rilthj
members of the Council and receiving their
nppro\Rl -t bas been determined to submit
r>r your contidersticn two propositions, wltn
the rÂ»<ju<--5t that >x.u express your preference.
This committee d<*s DOC believe nor does
It encourage the hope that it will b* poembla
to formulate any reasonable scheme ror a
municipally owned water plant that will not
b* the object of attack In the court by some
corporation or other adverse interest. It does
believe, however, that the two propositions
herein recvmiT'ended are as free from UanÂ£-ra
of this kind as ere any that could be pre
sented and we are not apprehensive of serl
ouÂ» obstacles or Olay to the successful con
summation of either cf the proposed plans.
The city muit take eome risk In this regard
<r else be forever held up by Interests ad
verse to the welfare of the city.
The committee desires your opinion as to
which one of these â¢chemes- should be adopted.
It intends to make the result* of this Informal
vote a sart of its report to the City Council.
As to its decision to present the two
proposals it has selected the committee
Fays:
Some of our citiseas undoubtedly prefer the
purchase 01 the Contra Costa plant and dis
tributing system, provided it could be boupnt
at a valuation not exorbitant. This is In ac
cord with the Idea of the committee, but this
Â«v.mmittee Is certain that a purchase at any
thing like a reasonable price Is impossible, for
the reason ameng others that although ths
compary made a written agreement a short
time Â«tnoe to sÂ«ll or lease Us plant to the
city at a valuation to be fixed by a board of
engineers and in the meantime to accept rates
hasod on' t*ich value. It promptly repudiated
the agreement when the time came to put It
In effect. Moreover, the company has not
ma<5e any further offer either to the Council
or to this committee.
OAKLAND, Nov. 14.â To learn the
community's sentiment touching the
various water supply projects that have
been submitted to the special commit
tee on municipal water plant, the com
mittee has called for a postal card vote
of citizens on two propositionsâ that of
the Bay Cities Water Company, to cost
Jp.700,000, and the development of an
underground supply from the artesian
belt in the Niles cone, to cost $3,500,000.
The committee intends to be guided in
its recommendation to the City Council
by the returns from its postal card can
vass. Voters are also requested to say
whether they oppose municipal owner-
In its statement to the public the
mmmittee says:
it Is expected that the canvass will be
completed before Saturday. The com
mittee is unanimous in its report to the
public.
pumping planta Installed, main pipe lines laid
and reservoirs constructed for $1.50U.000. This,
added to (2.000.000 for distributing system,
makes a total estimated coet of $3,500,000, as
against $5,750,000 that must bo expended on
the Hay Cities proposition. It will, in the
opinion of your committee, however, be worth
more than the present Contra Cotta Water
Company's plant.
The most desirable feature of this under
rround water supply U Its cheapness and the
fact that It can be made to serve our pur
:Â¦ 5i-s until such time as the growth of the
city and the utilizing of mountain sources of
supply will enable us to get, at reasonable
cost, a still more abundant supply of this
prime necessity of life. Any municipally
owned water supply makes It necessary for the
city to have a distributive system of its own.
The expense for this must j>e Incurred, even
though we should buy the Contra Costa Water
Company** plant, as a large part of its dis
tributive system will have to be renewed. The
committee estlmateo. hut without having had
complete engineering figures made, that the
cost of the pipe line, pumping plant, reservoirs,
and wells will not exceed $1. 500.000.
It Trill require from one to two years to put
this system In operation.

Knovr the Value of Pyramid Pile Cure.
"Gratitude alone prompts me to tes-
tify to the cfHcacy of Pyramid Pile
Cure. Last March I bought a dollar
package at the drugstore, which cured
me of bleeding piles, and I was a suf-
ferer from them for eight years; but I
had not been troubled with them since,
until last September, when I gave birth
to a baby girl, and after that I had a
very severe case of protruding piles,
which a trained nurse said was the
woret case phe ever saw. and my doctor
told me to firet Pyramid Pile Cure a Rain.
which I did and was completely cured
in three days. I have not had piles of
sny kind since, and it is all owing to
this wonderful remedy. My nurse took
a box. which I was glad to be able to
give her. for I know she will be able
to help lots of suffering people whom I
could never see or know.
"I recommend 'Pyramids' wherever I
know of any one suffering as I did. It
gives me great pleasure to be able to
say I am entirely cured, which my doc-
tor says is true. I say God bless Pyra-
mid Pile Cure." From a former great
Fufferer. Mrs. F, S. Ancott, 1206 Unity
street. Frankford. Philadelphia, Pa.
This remedy, which is sold by drug 1 -
Rists penerally. In fifty cent and dol-
lar packages, Is in a suppository form,
iÂ« applied directly to the parts affected
and performs Its work quietly and
painlessly. , Its value is evidenced by
the testimony given above, and we urge
all sufferers to buy a package now and
Cive it a trial to-night. Accept no sub-
ultutes and remember that there is no
remedy "Just as good."- A little book
Â«m the Cause and Cure of Piles is pub-
lished by the Pyramid Drug Co.. Mar-

BOSTON, Nov. 14. â The fierce
southern storm, vÂ»hich started off the
Florida coast on Saturday and swept
up the Atlantic seaboard, passed over
the maritime provinces to-day and to
night had its center off Cape Race,
Newfoundland. The storm in the
provinces, particularly along the pen
insula of Nova Scotia, was attended
with terrific gales and an unusually
low barometer, the glass at Halifax
to-day showing a mark of 28.6.
Telegraphic and telephonic com
munication with the provinces is in
terrupted and news coming from
Eastern Maine filtered through to-day
by a most circuitous route. To-night
there is no wire communication east
or north of Waterville, Me., and all
telegraphic connections between this
city and points in the State of Ver
mont is suspended. As reports have
been received here from points along
the New England coast regarding the
ravages of the storm a remarkably
small number of marine disasters was
noted. So far as known to-night only
two vessels were wrecked, the Rock
land schooner Arcularius, which went
ashore off the Tarpaulin Cove light
house on Naushon Island, . and the
Nautilus, which broke her back across
the new Dog bar, Gloucester harbor.
In neither case was there any loss of
life.
The chief damage caused by the
storm was the crippling of the tele
phonic, telegraphic and electric light
service throughout northern and east
ern New England. Through the entire
area of Maine, New Hampshire and
Vermont the course of the telegraph
and telephone lines is marked by hun
dreds, of poles that were blown down.
Clear and cold weather followed in
the wake of the storm.

NEW YORK. Nov. 15. 3:45 a, m.â -
The abattoirs at the foot of Sixth
street, Jersey City, are burning. Two
alarms have been sent in. but the fire
is spreading rapidly among the
buildings, which are of frame con
struction. . .
Trains of cattle cars belonging to
the Erie Railroad Company have been
drawn out of the fire zone.
Several large grain elevators stand
along the river front five or six blocks
from the fire, but they are not be
lieved to be in immediate danger.
The flames ran rapidly along the
water front toward the north and
were soon communicated to the docks
of the Berwynd-White Coal Company.
The terminal of the Erie Railroad is
situated not far south of these docks.
Great efforts were made by the men
employed about the abattoirs and
stockyards to save the cattle and it is
thought all were driven to places of
safety. Â¦ ;; v "Av;

tion taken would be null and void.

Columbia.
Fischer's Theater offers an attractive
bill this week. The new acts are novel
and amusing and win applause. The
Molassos, remarkable whirlwind dan
cers, who are seen for the first time
in America, are clever performers.
Bingham and Gabel, a musical novelty
team, play double cornets and play two
separate airs at the same time. The
juggling Thorns are clever in their line.
Le Mont's troupe of performing dogs
and other animals display wonderful
training and amuse the audience. The
De Nois family in a novel act and the
holdovers conclude a bill that will win
merit throughout the week-
Fischer's.
The uprising of the Wittbois is
thought to have finally convinced the
Colonial Office that Governor Leut
wein had failed to comprehend the
character of the native chiefs and
that he was unfit to longer remain at
his post, and his resignation, which
was tendered months ago, has been
accepted.
BERLIN, Nov. 14. â Colonel Leut
weln's retirement from the Governor
ship* of German Southwest Africa is
much discussed. The view finds gen
eral expression that he has been too
optimistic in his judgment of the na
tives and did not comprehend the
treacherous character of the chiefs.
Colonel Leutwein was too kind and
too trusting, believing the chiefs were
true subjects of Germany until they
were ready to resort to open rebel
lion. The colonists complained bit
terly of his mild policy toward the
natives.
Trusted the Natives Too Far and Will
Be Superseded In the Governor
ship.

sini, the Russian Embassador, who is

A procession was then formed out
side the car and Secretary Peirce led
the way with the Prince on his arm.
There was a small crowd at the sta
tion, but no particular demonstration
was made. The Prince and party were
driven to the Arlington Hotel, where
they will stay while in Washington.
The pro-gramme for the entertain
ment of the Prince will begin to-mor
row morning at 10 o'clock, when he
will be presented to the President. The

The surprise of the performance â
there Is always a surpriseâ was Luke
Conness as Richard Sterling. As a rule
Mr. Conness lacks light for me. He is
obvious, hard, rough in method as a
rule, but he convinced strongly in the
Sterling role last night. Mr. Craig has
the part of Warden and played it in his
usual direct and competent fashion,
with, however, a rare and becoming
note of softness an dtenderness in the
little love scene. John Maher was in
his ouptomarr useful evidence as Mis
tah Trotter. For the rest, the produc
tion is ptaped in unusually handsome
fashion and will altogether repay a
visit. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Miss Laurence fcas the role of Blanche
Sterling, and shows therein her usual
easy and accomplished art â and also
her something lacking of emotional
temper. But that isn't her fault, and
eg v. ell does Miss Lawrence simulate
feeling that, while conscious of the me
chanics, one ir- always grateful for the
result. Her Riajiche Sterling is to be
gin with a lady, quite importantly, and
again a very womanly woman. Eliza
beth YÂ»'oodsc>n has the Bijou Fernandez
ic!e, and very cleverly Elizabeth Wood
son does the typical Nevr York girl. It
is Miss Woodson's first real chance
here. a.rd the fashion in which she has
ts.ken advantage of it augurs happily
fur her future. Miss Marie Baker as the
lashior.ab'.e mamma fills in usefully, to-
ECtber with Miss Belgarde â always dis
tinguished â as Miss Hunter, and Miss
Ruth Allen, perhaps a leetle overâ may
< ne say "tough" in connection with a
New York society girl? â as Clara Hun
ter.
"Stubbornnesses of Geraldine." And
all the familiar Fitch virtues, the
piquancy of the theme, situations, the
cdroit handling of the clean, smart,
portraiture, are here in liveliest evi
dence. It is Fitch at his best and Â»the
Alrazar at its most. ."%i
And we!! wears the play. The shud
der of the funeral scene, with its
wretched family squabbles, the "dark"
Bcene â darr.ned by all readers of the
p!ay before Amelia Bingham dared it â
the* clever, oh, so clever: Christmas
scene, all tell Just as freshly as ever.
The play is full of meatâ it ivas written
bt-fore Fitch became economical. There
is substance in it for at least three
Any one desiring to renen- acquaint
ance with Clyde Fitch at his cleverest
âin "The Climbers"â need have no
doubt about doing it by way of <he
Alcazar this week. It is an extraord
inarily good performance. There is
not, of course, a Wilton Lackaye in
that weirdly powerful picture of his
of the moral incompetent Richard Ster
ling, nor yet a Bijou Fernandez New
York girl in the ca?t But a well-cut
coat fits more men than an ill-cut one,
and Fitch 'Â« tailoring here fits more
snugly than anything else the Alcazar
r2nks have lately worn.
Miss Block has not suffered from her
vacation from the local stage. Her act
ing was done under all of the intelligent
control and sympathetic interpretation
that has always characetrized it. J. H.
Gilmour fits the part of the purged
bachelor wholly. Howard Gould's Harry
Harmony, though needing a little ton
ing.down. is acceptable. As the French
dancer Miss Eleanor Gordon plays sec
ond only to the lead in the piece.
"Hearts Aflame." Miss Block, well
groomed, statuesque as in the heydey
of the Alcazar stock days, was there
to sweep her train through a problem
play in the old style, and the audience
gave her right royal welcome.
The piece, which is a new one for San
Francisco, is of the latest variety of
New York productions, wherein the
"problem" is one self-evident and in
sistently unpleasant, and the atmos
phere not that advocated by the Rev.
Charles Wagner's "Simple Life." A
gay bachelor supper, a midnight meet
ing of unpleasant possibilities and all
the round of divorce", scandal and the
like are features in the groundwork of
the play â a play well enough done for
those that like this genre.

Miniature, Dinner Train.
An English firm has built a small
train, specially for a millionaire, to
carry about decanters and cigars after
dinner. The litle engine, over which
two dolls in blu,e overalls preside, Is
constructed of silver-plated copper in
miniature reproduction of a locomotive.
The tender is stacked with coals from
the millionaire's own coal mine. When
the millionaire touches a button the
train starts. It runs quite slowly
round the . track, and when a , guest
picks up a decanter the current ' is
broken and the train stops till he re
places it. The total length of the
train, which is driven by electricity.
Is over five feet and the track Is con

S~\ ENERAL GREELY, chief signal officer of the army, has
( j succeeded in connecting remote Alaska with the world by
v p- > telegraph. The work has been under way so quietly that the
country first hears of It in the announcement of its completion. The
system includes 3518 miles of cable and land lines and 107 miles of
wireless. This brings Bering Straits and the valley of the Yukon
and Cape Nome into instant communication with the world.
The completion of the line is one of the great constructive
works of the world. A few years ago it would have attracted as
much attention as the building of our first transcontinental railways,
but we are so accustomed now to great works that they have become
common. The magnitude of this will dawn upon us when telegram j
come direct from the Arctic Ocean. Men of middle age will prob
ably live to see this telegraph wire to Bering Straits followed by a
railroad that will carry passengers to a ferry running .to the shore of
Siberia. Rmh

it means to apply the law of eminent domain to land, and to extend
the law of eminent domain, till it embraces the mines, the factories,
the railroads and the ocean carriers. In short, the Socialist party
intends to destroy the present day society, Which it contends is run in
the interest of the merchant or capitalist class, and from the mate
rials to construct a new society which will be run in the interest of
the working class." Mr. London concludes His statement with this
impassioned outburst: "My masters, you are in the minority. How
will you manage to keep the majority of the votes? What will you,
my masters? What will you?"
It will be seen that he proposes to move against the owners of
landed property. This is because they are the least capable of organ
ization. When nearly 1,000,000 people in the United States vote for
that programme, as was the /case at this last election, the extreme
seriousness of the situation will appear. Socialism is sure to take
the place of all of the political fads that have been rife for the last
thirty years. It will be the Aaron's rod of the situation. It will aim
to increase the number of non-property owners. Mr. London says
it embraces many nations, andjts invitation is to their propertyless
people to come hither, be naturalized and by their, votes hasten the
confiscation and division of the wealth of the United States. True,
he says this confiscation will be with or without compensation. But
compensation would be illogical, since it would be transferring the
form of property, which is not Socialistic. We may be sure that
when the Socialists get the power to confiscate there will be no talk
about compensation.
Mr. Hearst is already familiarizing his followers with this pro
gramme and gives large space and display in the Examiner to a
definition of Socialism by Mr. Jack London, whom he describes as
"one of the world's authorities on Socialism." Mr. London leads up
to his definition by stating that the banner of Socialism "is blood
red" and that it "aims to pull down society to its foundation and
upon a new foundation to build up a new society." By way of
preparation for its attack on property he says that "it literally
swamps the working classes in a vast sea of tracts and pamphlets
* * * which teach the gospel of the common' man against the
uncommon man, who has expressed his uncommonness by gather
ing to himself the wealth of the world." He characterizes this as
the "preaching of an uncompromising and deadly class struggle."
After a full description of the propaganda he declares its purpose,
and to this the attention of the people will be more and more di
rected.
He says : "This working class Socialist revolt is a revolt against
the capitalist class. The Socialist party aims to capture the political
machinery of society. With the political machinery in its hands,
which will also give it control of the police, the army, the navy and
the courts, its plan is to confiscate, with or without compensation, all
the possessions of the capitalist class which are used in the produc
tion and distribution of the luxuries and necessaries of life. By this
That coalition is now moving visibly and rapidly. All of the
forces, calling themselves Democratic, through which another reor
ganization of that party is urged, are Socialistic in feeling and pur
pose. Hearst, Bryan and Watson are essentially Socialistic in all
their views of government. Whoso preaches -discontent; whoso toils
to artificially create a working class that seeksjts own aggrandize
ment at the expense of all others; whoso condemns all owners of
property as capitalists, and puts them in a class charged with the
oppression of others, is preaching and practicing Socialism.
It is more evident now than any other thing political in the
future that this issue will be upon the country in full force in 1908.
The large increase in the Socialist vote this year is attracting the ex
pediency politicians. In 1896 Henry George said the conflict was be
tween the House of Want and the House of Have. He would prob
ably have denied that this was the essence of Socialism, but it is.
Until recent years Socialism has been in this country the subject of
academic discussion only. It was not organized into a party. Now
its leaders are awake to the enormous advantage of the universal fran
chise and the free ballot. In the last analysis it is always true that
only that is property which society says shall be property. Formerly
society said that men might own other men, and the system of chat
tel slavery originated and was long maintained. Finally society was
impressed by the moral side of the issue, and in all nations with
drew its assent to the existence of property in man, and chattel sla
very ceased to be. There is no gainsaying that if society can be
brought to accept the text of Socialism, that property is robbery,
there will be no property of any kind. That is the purpose of
Socialism.
In Europe property is too strongly entrenched and suffrage is
too limited to furnish an untrammeled opportunity for the elimina
tion of property. Here there is no such limitation, and as soon as
the House of Want can outvote the House of Have the latter will
tumble down and the ruins will be divided. Every law, Federal and
local, that gives title and ownership to real and personal property
can be wiped off the statute books, and property will cease, to be
by the simple process of withdrawing the assent of society to its
existence.
The first assault is made upon the most unpopular form of
property, the corporate. This is proper tactics from the Socialist
standpoint, for it brings allies who are not Socialists, hut whose votes
support the leveling process. When property is putlawed because it
is owned by the many stockholders of a corporation, each is de
prived of his share, and there is no difference between that and
taking from him the property he owns in severalty.

AH Monday forenoon he sat gloom

there came a diversion. A group of

Rigas and demanded that he put them

Maria had announced that at last she
was ready to make a cljolce from
among her many suitors. When the
road was completed she would marry
the , one who had worked the most
faithfully.
Day after day the work- continued
with unabated ardor and at last it was*
finished. The first train had run over
it and had brought : to Bud ; a letter
from, the superintendent; of construc
tion . In which many complimentary
Late Sunday evening Bud's plan
took shape. The old engine was coupled
to a flat car and backed down to Rigas.
Bud disappeared in the rear of the
hotel and soon reappeared bearing a
very lirnp and passive citizen of that
metropolis in his arms. He deposited
his burden on the car and then re
peated the trip. In a short time his
v orking force was complete and To
masso received orders to steam l&ck
to the camp. A very satisfactory
amount of work' was done that week
and during each of a number of suc
ceeding weeks, thanks to a continued
desecration of Sunday evening siestas.
There remained only a few miles of
road to complete and Bud was feeling
much encouraged. The successful com
pletion of the work meant promotion
for him, a good salary, and besides,
when he had a good position, andâ
well. Tomasso's daughter, Maria, was,
to say the least, a mighty pretty girl.
She had been away to school some
where in California, and admitted to
him that It" seemed very nice to hear
real "English" again. She did so like
to talk English. Bud rather enjoyed
it, too, and .as a result they talked
English to such effect that, on several
occasions he was perilously near to
overcoming a colossal bashfulness and
saying what she?, being a twentieth
century Eve, knew that he wanted to
say.
But now Bud was utterly and ab
jectly disheartened. Cerves, the local
dispenser of liquid refreshments, at
last had discovered why his week-day
Bales had become so ridiculously
small. And so one Sunday evening
Bud was unable to recruit his gang of
laborers In the usual manner. Instead
of sleeping off the effects of their po
tations in the rear of the hotel, ac
cording to the established custom of
the place, they were all securely dis
posed In Cerves' cellar under lock and
key, where the Americano could not
get them. Bud threatened, he de
manded, he even off ered . bribes of
money, but it was in vain. Cerves was
not 'quick to get an idea, but when
once he had one lodged firmly In his
head nothing could displace It. It
must be left to die of old age. So Bud
went to see Maria and poured out the
whole of his woes into her sympa
thetic ears.
Tomasso was politely curious.
"If I get those fellows out here
they will stay another' week, won't
they? I heard something about It's
being bad luck to stop in the middle
of the week." - Â¦ . . . . (
Tomasso thought they would stay.
In fact he was sure that they would.
UD was discouraged- Every line
Bof his six feet of .robust man
hood spoke more* eloquently
than words his utter weariness
of soul.
Three months before, when
the boss had called him into his office
and after a few complimentary re
marks had .placed him in charge of a
construction gang known as the "bad
job" of the road, he had hailed the op
portunity with Joy. The road wished
to construct a short spur into Mexico
to afford an outlet for ; some silver
mines. When the concession had been
secured from the Mexican Government
on* of the conditions had been that the
labor should be done by the natives of
the region through which the line was
to be constructed.
This had seemed a simple matter,
but two years had now passed and the
work was far from finished. One man
after another had been sent to take
charge of the work, and with the great
est regularity, they had'asked . for a
change of work at the end of the first
month. In case this request was not
granted they had promptly resigned,
to seek service with another com
pany.
"Mr. Maxwell," his chief had said,
"I want you to take charge of that
work and get it out somehow and
some time. I should advise you, by
way of equipment for the undertak
ing, to take along the biggest six
shooter that you can get."
When Bud had reached the con
struction camp he had found it de
serted. He went back to the little
town of Rigas and recruited a gang of
gome twenty men. Everything moved
along peacefully until Saturday night.
Then they all bade him a respectful
"adios" and Btarted back " toward
Rigas. Expostulation was in vain.
Why should they work longer? Had
they not earned the remarkable wages
of one and a half dollars for each of
Fix days? And was that not enough to
support themselves and their families
in plenty for weeks to come? No! No!
They would not work any more. So
they all left except Tomasso, the com
bined engineer and fireman, who had
once served on a yard engine in St.
Louis and had acquired a more
abiding taste for work.
Bud seated himself on a deserted
bunk and thought the situation over.
He sat so long that Tomasso, mildly
solicitous, ventured to suggest to him
that it was very multissima late-.
"Tomasso, what are those greasers
doing over at Rigas?"
"La vina, senor."
"Talk American, Tomasso."
"In American â the booze."
"Thought so! Tomasso, I've got an
idea."
things were said. Little cared Bud
for high-flown phrases. It wassail
over and to-morrow some greaser
would be made happy by the pret
tiest girl in Mexico. From force of
habit, however, he wandered toward
Tomasso's little garden.

that a woman's will is usually a won't.
Nobody retains any illusions about the

Yet one of the sex's favorite regrets
is that it is not understood. A woman
likes to feel that her nature is as com

Meanwhile she prides -herself upon
her knowledge of man. Does she un
derstand her sweetheart? I should say
she did! Can't she twist him round her
finger? Does she understand her hus
band? The 'question is absurd.
Doesen't she manage to get her own
way in everything?
Here she rests satisfied, in spite of
the fact that she has only opened up
the possibility of the situation.
I believe that most men go through
life pretty lonely after the first flush
of gratified love has faded for them. A
man tries to do his duty by his home,

of it as a reward. . '-.'_>. .

the puir, paltry, pitiful, faded, fushion
less, cauldrified and chittering substi
tute, truth."
Not truth, say I, is such a marriage
as the one Implied. It is halfvtruth, or
even less than that. There Is far more
truth in what the Ettrlck shepherd
calls "a He."
But there are certain grounds of com
mon interest on which a married couple
do not agree without a mutual effort
to understand each other.
A man's spiritual outlook, for one
thing, is difficult for a woman to grasp.
The force behind her work is faith; her
face is ever turned toward the light, of
the life to come. The force behind his
work is courage, the power- to act
worthily in the difficult present.
Facing- the worst, he hopes the beat;
Singring he works, while women bid him
prayâ
The wrong hii busy arms arrest
Her faith commits Into a higher way.
A man, on the other side, does not al
ways realize how important a part sen
timent and its trivial expressions play
in the life of the woman he has mar
ried. Ordinarily he Is too busy. For
love's sake, as the poet says, he divides
delight with duty.
But meanwhile let her not mistake â
he cherishes within his breast a thought
of her which helps to keep him true.
Uncrackable Glass.
Glass that can be heated white hot
and then plunged Into cold water with
out breaking seems an impossibility,
but it has been recently made an ac
complished fact. It is made from Bra
zilian quartz pebbles heated red hot
and then thrown Into distilled water.
Then the purest pieces are selected
and welded with â¢ the . oxyhydrogen
blowpipe into long stems like straws,
from which glass vessels of any shape
can be made. Thus far this quartz
glass has been ' employed chiefly for
making laboratory apparatus. A test

P. H. McCarthy was busy with
other matters last evening, bo he
failed to appear before the Board of

said against the mechanical perfection
and honesty of the voting machine.
Mr. McCarthy will be heard at a later
date.

DIVORCE DECREE NEARLY
A YEAR OLD SET ASIDE
The national board consists of twen
ty-one members, including officers of
the army and navy and militia officers,
trustees of the National Rifle Associa
tion and civilians from all parts of
the country, so that whatever plah of
procedure is adopted it is safe to as
sume it will be one which will be fair
to all the States desiring the establish
ment of such ranges.
The same Is especially true of the
Southern States, where the popula
tion is largely rural, and It is con
tended that it would be very unfair
to Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
Florida and other Southern States If
the plan should be adopted establish
ing ranges in States according to the
population of their cities. A proposi
tion to establish these ranges in the
States according to the quota of their
National Guard is also being consid
ered, but the plan of establishing one
range in each State before other States
shall be allowed more than one range
is receiving favorable consideration.
CASE OF THE SOUTH.
In the case of Indianapolis a fort has
been recently established there. Fort
Harrison, which offers an excellent lo
cation for a range, which could be used
by riflemen within a radius of fifty
miles of Indianapolis for practice on
Saturday afternoons and holidays, and
for those from Cincinnati, Louisville
and Chicago who desire to spend sev
eral days on the range. There is a
Bt/ong influence being exerted to secure
one of the ranges for Indianapolis.
The question of property value in
end about New York will doubtless be
a source of concern when allowances
are made for ranges In the vicinity of
Greater New York. It requires a large
stretch of territory, as ranges of at
least 1000 yaeds are desired, and prop
erty of such an extent within easy
trolley distance of New York is ex
tremely valuable.
There has been some discussion as
to the method of procedure in acquir
ing and locating these ranges. On the
one hand it is thought that the na
tional board should, first provide for
the establishment of ranges in the
vicinity of the larger cities, beginning
with New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Boston, St. Louis and so
on down the list. On the other hand, It
is contended that under such proced
ure States like Indiana, with approxi
mately 1.000,000 men eligible for ser
vice in time of war. would be one of
the later States where ranges would
be established, as Indianapolis is
quite far down the list of cities ac
cording to its population.
PLEA OP IXDIAXAPOLIS.
CALL. BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â The fact that
the national board for the promotion of
rifle practice will ask Congress at its
coming session to appropriate $1,000,000
annually for the next few years to â¢ be
devoted to the establishment and equip
ment of suitable rifle ranges in the
vicinity of the larger cities and to the
issuing of arms and ammunition under
certain restrictions has awakened a
great deal of interest throughout the
country, and applications are pouring
in for the location of these ranges. It
is contemplated that ranges shall be
established in the vicinity of Boston,
New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Balti
more, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Den
ver, San Francisco, Salt Lake and Los
Angeles.
. While the selection of these cities
would naturally be gratifying to the
residents thereof who would like to en
gage in rifle practice for the exercise
and pleasure connected therewith, the
riflemen in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Louis
ville, Indianapolis, Mobile, Savannah,
Buffalo and other cities feel that they
the quite as much Interested in the
proposition and as much entitled to
recognition as the riflemen of the other
cities mentioned. .New York has ah ex
cellent range at Creedmoor, and the
range at Sea Girt, N. J., is accessible
to riflemen of the Eastern States. It is
therefore represented that when the na
tional board secures the initial appro
priation it should set about establishing
ranges in States which are not so fa
vored.

When Edwin E. Stoddard appeared
In Judge Cook's court yesterday for
trial on a charge of felony embezzle
ment he pleaded guilty and waived
time for sentence. His attorney, John
J. Barrett, made a strong plea for le
niency, in which he was supported by
Attorney Bush Fennell, special prose
cutor. The Judge sentenced Stoddard
to serve eighteen months in San Quen
tin.
Stoddard was head of the bicycle de
partment in the warehouse of the Dun
ham, Carrigan & Hayden Company and
was discharged on January 1. An in-'
vestigation of his books showed a short
age of $4000. His peculations had been
going on for two years.
After leaving the company's employ
ment Stoddard went into the automo
bile business at 128 Fremont street,
with J. B. Spaulding as a partner. He
was arrested on February 6, the day
before the formal opening of his auto
mobile establishment, but was released
on bail the following day. It Is said
that his wife will carry on the business
while he is serving his term in San
Quentln. Stoddard was a well-known
wheelman and a member of the Bay
City Club. \
About the time that Judge Cook was
passing sentence upon Stoddard, W. T.
Robertson, secretary of the Auto Liv
ery Company, 1138 Market street, made
application before Police Judge Fritz;
for a warrant for Stoddard's arrest on \
a charge of malicious mischief. Stod
dard Is a stockholder in the company,
and on Saturday he tore up the carpets
in the office and attempted to take
forcible possession of the premises.
While the warrant was being written
out the" Judge was notified of Stod
dard's sentence, and when it was pre
sented to ' him for signature he tore it
up, explaining to Robertson that Stod
dard had been sent to San Quentin.
Telegraphic advices are to the effect
that the board of engineers employed
to investigate the reclamation problem
is about to meet in the East to draw up
the final plans and specifications. Prank
D. Ryan, State Commissioner of Pub
lic "Works, will leave for the East in a
few days to confer with the board of
engineers having the v ork in hand. Its
final decision on Oie work to be per
formed will soon follow this conference.
The board is composed of Henry B.
Richardson of Louisiana, Major T. O.
Dabney of Mississippi and Major H. M.
Chittenden of Yellowstone National
Park.
Congressman-elect McKlnlay said
yesterday that though he would not
take his seat until March 4, he would
attend the coming session to familiarize
himself with the work of Congress, and
especially to aid his associates in de
ciding upon the most promising mode
of procedure to secure the appropria
tion for the carrying out of the plans
of the board of englneera.
With eight Congressmen and two
Senators, all Republican, bending their
energies to carry the plans to comple
tion there is no question that they will
succeed, and California will reap its re
ward for the splendid plurality it gave
the party in the battle that has just
been merged into history.
READY TO DRAW PDAN T S.
After Mr. McKinlay had left head
quarters it was given out that an agree
ment had been reached by the Con
gressmen and Congressmen-elect to
make the question of the reclamation of
the inundated lands of the State the
main fight of their incumbency. Early
in December the board of engineers em
ployed by the River Drainage Associa
tion of this State will file its report as
to the most feasible plan for the recla
mation of inundated lands, and then
the time will be ripe for Congressional
action.
It is not probable, however, that the
question will be laid before Congress at
the coming session. The plan pi the
board of engineers must be first studied
In detail and the matter of cost of the
proposed 5 improvements as suggested
by its members carefully calculated
before the California Senators and Rep
resentatives will be in a position to de
bate the question and answer any ob
jection that may be raised by any mem
ber of the Senate or House that feels
so inclined.
AGREEMENT IS REACHED.
Citizens of the great Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys are to be congratu
lated over the fact that at the election
of a week ago . the entire Republican
Congressional ticket of the State was
victorious. It means to them that their
dream of years â the reclamation of the
inundated lands of the basinsâ Is about
to be realized."
Although the reclamation of the In
undated lands of the State affects di
rectly only four of the Congressional
districts, it is admitted that indirectly
it affects every citizen of the State.
With this fact in mind a movement is
now well under way looking to a united
effort on the part of . the eight Con
gressmen and two Senators of the State
to secure a sufficient appropriation
from the Government to reclaim the in
undated lands of the State, confine the
great rivers to their natural channels
and utilize their surplus waters for the
irrigation of the arid lands . of the
southern districts.
Congressman-elect McKlnlay was in
the city yesterday In consultation with
those most interested in the great prob
lem that is born with the yearly over
flow of the rivers named. Land owners
of Colusa and near-by points that an
nually suffer from the rush of waters
called upon him to offer suggestions.
Their observations were recorded for
future use. '

land fell in a disgraceful heap on the
floor, pulling Wills down with him.
Bystanders then interfered and
Wheatland was advised to retire. In
stead, however, he persisted in mak
ing more trouble and finally . had to
be taken in charge by porters and by
force was hurried to the hotel base

Drag Clerk In Trouble.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.âCommis
sioner of Pensians Ware to-day ten
dered his resignation to the President
and it was accepted, to take effect on
January 1.
To-night Cominissioner Ware refused
to discuss his action in any way ex
cept to sav that the newspapers of the
country had been "resigning" him for
the past two years.
For at least a year it had been defi
nitely known that Ware would resign
from his office soon after the fall elec
tions and return to his home in Kan
sas to resume his law practice. It is be
lieved here that Commissioner Ware's
action was not due to any suggestion
that the severance of his relations with
the Pension Office would be agreeable
to the President. On the contrary, it
has been no secret that Commissioner
Ware soon after assuming his duties
found them distasteful to him and that
this distaste steadily increased.
There is no intimation to-night as to
who his successor will be.
CHICAGO, Nov. 14.â The Interstate
Commerce Commission to-day began
testimony in three cases involving rates
on live stock from Western and South
western points to Chicago and terminal
points on the Mississippi River. About
$1,000,000 a year in freight rates is said
to be at stake. J. W. Grueber of
Omaha, general superintendent of the
Union Pacific Railway, was a witness.
"The heaviest cattle shipments are
niade about the same time of the year
as the dead freight shipments," said
Grueber, "and in the stime direction.
This makes the empty mileage of our
cars which must be returned very
gTeat. We can but rarely attain the
schedule of speed fixed for stock trains,
and tiiere Is the added expense of car
ing for stock which is on the road
longer than it should be."
Grueber was closely questioned re
garding this inability to run the stock
trains through on time on account of
density of traffic, when by his own ad
mission passenger trains maintained a
schedule of twenty-eight to forty-two
miles an hour.
"Which is the more expensive, to run
these trains fast or slow?" asked Mr.
Prouty.
"Of course, fast running is more ex
pensive on account of fuel and wear of
machinery." replied the witness.
"Then you are really saving money
by this inability to keep up to the
schedule with these trains, are you
not?" he was asked.
"No: the trains run as fast as re
quired between stations, but are com
pelled to wait at sidings and stations
fnr other trains to pass."
Commissioner Ware Will

Interstate Commerce Board
Begins Hearing on Tariff
. on Shipments From West
The intention is to reduce unskilled
labor wages from 17% cents an hour to
15 cents. Skilled beef butchers are paid
at the rate of 50 cents an hour. The
new scale contemplated Is 32% cents an
hour, no workman to receive more than
$3 25 for a day of ten hours.
The cut, however, is not to affect
those who remained at work during the
recent strike.
It is said that as a result of the re
ports of the foremen it was decided to
put the cut into effect without delay.
The men say that if the proposed re
duction be attempted and the skilled
workmen be given only broken time
they will be able to earn only a mere
pittance.
The unions are still suffering from
the effects of last summer's strike,
when their treasuries were completely
exhausted, and are in no condition to
enter upon another struggle with the
packers.
OMAHA, Nov. 14.â Consternation was
created among the packing-house em
ployes in South Omaha this morning
when the news leaked out that a big
cut in wages was to be announced at
once. A number of foremen in the
larger plants were last week Instructed
to sound the employes to see If they
would stand a reduction of 15 to 35 per
cent.

TACOMA. Nov. 14. â Rear Admiral

Nevertheless, he is willing to give the
American ships every oppqrtunlty to
secure the contract for transporting

Admiral Walker says he doubts if

announces that he proposes when
next calling for bids for lumber to
call for its delivery at Panama both
in American and foreign vessels. In
conclusion he says:

There were eight starters in the
mile and seventy yard selling fixture
and a highly imaginative mind could
figure any of the number to get home
in front. Finally a well directed bom
bardment forced the price against
Louis Ezell's old horse, . Flying Tor
pedo, from fours to 9 to 5 favoritism.
Torpedo showed improvement!" in his
gait, but was defeated with apparent
ease by Canejo, a 5 to 1 chance, piloted
by Herbert. Play Ball, the entry of
Mike Daly, ran a close third.
A wild, weird tip on Squire John
son prevented the admirers of Pelham
from betting half as -much as they
otherwise would on the Henshall en
try to take the fifth event. There were
no Silverskins- or George P. McNears
present, so 3 to 5 looked a most ac
commodating price on Pelham. He
early assumed control and did not re
quire much hustling to dispose of the
Squire by nearly three lengths. Head
Dance finished third and with a closer
ride might have been a contender for
the place.
Billy Magrane's old stand-by, Matt
Hogan, favorite for the closing event,
had speed to loan his poor relations.
Joe Jones took a trick at the wheel,
and, getting the first choice away in
front, won in ragtime fashion. Bell,
on Aunt Polly, took place honors from
Doublet.
It looks rather early to be springing
one with the ring laying three figures
about the horse, but Jimmy Coffey dis
regarded past traditions and led one
into the judges' circle at Oakland yes
terday. The sensation happened in the
introductory piece, a Futurity course
sprint. On his race last Saturday Mor
ris Eppinger's Whoa Bill looked like a
little bit off from the top, and the smart
ones purchased extensively at odds of 7
to 10. Cloche d'Or. the Coffey entry,
with Fitzpatrick up, opened at 50 and
soared to 100 to 1. To sum it up quick
ly, the favorite might have won. but
he bledâ an old affliction. When things
looked rosy for Inspector Munro, also
an outsider. Fitzpatrick slipped up with
Cloche d'Or, winning by a neck. Whoa
Bill was third, and the combination
players put crepe on the arm.
Although there was unmistakable evi
dence of a storm brewing and the card
looked a lightweight one, the attend
ance was large. Still. Monday is usu
ally a big day. Favorites captured
three events.
â¢ The Nealon stable furnished a warm
one for the five-furlong spin, maiden
fillies only being eligible, in Entre Nous.
With McFadden up, 2% to 1 was ac
cepted, and the good thing finished
third. Alec Forbes predicted success for
Princess Zula, and, well ridden by
Helgesen, the Take Notice filly won
ridden out from Glendene. Five to one
Avas quoted against the winner.
Dan Lamasney's Albula was re
turned a winner of the third, a six
furlong purse run. The chestnut horse
had nothing much to beat and at odds
of 11 to 20 led from start to finish.
Gorgalette, the runner-up, petered out
it, the stretch, losing the place to Sol
Lichtensteln. Oronte was the only
other starter.

Newport News, Va., Jnly 22, 1903.
Last summer while recovering from ill-
ness of fever, I had a severe attack of
Inflammatory Rheumatism in the knees,
from which I was unable to leave my
room for several months. I was treated
by two doctors and also tried different
kinds of linaments and medicines which
seemed to relieve me from pain for
awhile, bnt at the same time I was not
any nearer getting well. One day while
reading a paper I saw an advertisement
of S. S. S. for Rheumatism. I decided
to give it a trials which I did at once.
After I had taken three bottles I felt a
great deal better, and I still continued
to take it regularly until I was entirely
cured. I now feel better than for years,
and I cheerfully recommend S. S. S. to
any one suffering from Rheumatism.

Rheumatism is caused by uric acid or
some other acid poison in the blood,
which when deposited in the muscles
and joints, produce the sharp, cutting
pains and the stiffness and soreness pe-
culiar to this disease. S. S. S. goes di-
rectly into the circulation, all irrita-
ting substances are neutralized and
filtered out of the system, the blood is
made pure and the general health is
built up under the purifying and tonic

cati5e his *kull was fractured by \ brick fall
in? from a scaffolding on a building which t?>Â«
firm was constructlns. The accident occurred
PÂ«>ptomr*r 14.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee j
has decided that it will not countenance j
frame buildings for tlrehouses. The |
announcement was made during con- |
sideration of the request of the Fire
Committee that $4000 be set.. aside in
the next budget to build an addition |
to the fire engine-house on Twentieth |
street, near Connecticut. The sum of
$4000 is to be expended at once for a
wooden building. Â¦ Chief Shaughnessy
said a brick building would cost tSfOOQL I
The committee thought the lot should j
be purchased by the city, It having j
been leased for the purpose. The Board j
of Works was then requested to flle
plans both for brick and wooden build
ings on the Twentieth street lot and
also on the site at Twenty-sixth and
Point Lobos avenues, on both of which
flrehouses are to be constructed. It i
is desired to ascertain the comparative !
cost of wooden and brick buildings.
The- Finance Committee postponed
consideration of the street sweeping
and sprinkling bills until January next.
Expert Williams filed a report showing
that in July the sum of 521,844 92 was
expended, in August $22,667 37, and in j
September $19,264 17. The committee i
will also investigate as to whether it
shall audit demands for wages for this
service. v . * Â» c
The recommendation of the commit
tee that the ordinance submitted by
the Merchants' Association regulating
the safe operation of sidewalk elevators
be passed to print was ratified by the !
board. The ordinance was amended to :
provide that before the j elevator doors
or gratings are opened removable metal
guards consisting of four metal posts,
three feet in height shall be inserted
In sockets in the sidewalks at the four
corners of such -doors, connected by
chains or bars so that all sides of the
openings shall be guarded except the
side next to the curb
. Tax Collector Smith urged the-com
mittee to adopt a resolution to mark
excess taxes on unsecured personal
property Involving the payment of less j
than 2 cents as paid on the assessment
books. Smith explained that " the taxes j
were collected under the old rate of |
1903, whereas the rate for 1904 was 1.8:
cents more. It would necessitate send- '
ing notices to x 25.000 householders who !
would owe the city less than 2 centa. i
and the expense of collection would
be more than the sum of $S"502 to be col- i
lected. The committee was favorable i
to the plan but postponed action for
one week.
B. Hayes was cited to appear next
Monday to explain his bill of $330 for;
moving sixteen voting machines.
The committee sent a letter to Au
ditor Baehr asking him If he intends
to appeal the case of the health em
ployes who recovered Judgments

One of San Francisco's Best-Known
Business Men Tells of the Cure
of His Wife and Himself -by the
Wonderful New ::::::

MS. A2TD SUES. J. A. CHRISTEN.
1427 Valencia St.. San Praaciaco.
Mr. J. A. Christen, who, ia the testimonial below, tells of fhe cor* of him-
Â¦elf and Mm wife toy the Electro-Chemlc treatment, is one of the bwt-knowa
business men in San Francisco. The Christen Banch Dairy is known all over
the city for thÂ© hijrh duality of tha milk served to the dairy's customer!. Mr.
Christen and his sons are the sole owners of this most successful business. Mr.
Christen has been a resident of San Francisco for thirty-six years. For six
years lie has lived with his family at XTo. 1427 Valencia street. His ranch Is
situated in San Mateo County, one mile from Colma Station. It Is testimonials
of Â¦well-known people 'who live riarht her* in San Francisco that has oroniras
attention of the public in ereneral to th* wonderful curative effects of the Eleo-
tro-Chemio treatment.
In speaking of tl^ cure of his wife and himself Mr. Christen said: "My old friend,
Jacob Bryaa, who for fourteen years was postmaster at Colma, k=ew that I felt badly
and he himself having Been so successfully treated at the Electro-Caemtc Institute. 119
Grant ave., San Francisco, advised me to tiy th9 Electro-Chemic treatment. Â».Â« the med-
ical treatments which I had used were not reaching my trauble. So. on Mr. Bryan's
recommendation I visited th* Electro-Chemio Institute for "examination and consultation,
which was free. I was so pleased with the examination and advice given me that I did" not
hesitate to plac* the treatment of my case In the care of the Electro-Chemic specialists
at once. I am glad to say that my improvement was immediate, and in about five weeks
I was thoroughly cured at a small expense. My troubi* was bad circulation and con-
gestion of Important organs. . My stomach, liver, bowels and . kidneys wer*
in a bad condition. Thla interfered with the srer.eral circulation of the blood and I had
dizzy spells, so severs at times that I could hardly keep from falling, and In fact, at onÂ»
time I did fall down and was unconscious for some little time. My wife was suffering
greatly with rheumatism and congested liver. The pain below thÂ» liver was so sever*
that wo feared appendicitis. My.wlfa had good medical attention, but her trouble con-
tinued to grow worse In spite of all we could do. As I was getting along so nicely I
insisted upon my wife taking the Electro-Chemio course and we are both delighted to
say that within two weeks' time she was thoroughly cur i. all pa:n about tha appesdix
and liver disappearing, as If by magic. Her rheumatism, from which, shÂ« had suffered for
years, seems to be thoroughly cured in lust two weeks' treatment by Electro-Chemistry.
This seems so wonderful to me that I am more than delight ."d to make thla publle ac-
knowledgment of thÂ« cure of my wlf* and myself. I do this for two reasons: First, be-
cause I feel grateful to the Electro-Chemlc Specialists, and secondly, because I believe that
the general public ought to know more about this wcnderfnl new treatment. I believe that
I am well enough known in a business way for any cne who may read this statement
to believe that every word of It is absolutely true.

"To enforce ordinances tending to

"To enforce landlords to live up to
their leases, and supply heat and make
promised improvements.
"To co-operate with labor unions and
all other lawful organizations working
in the interest of the landless class."
CHICAGO, Nov. 14.â Now the tenants
propose to organize. Following the foot
steps of unionized factory workers, as
sociated employers and organized prop
erty owners, the flat dwellers and house
holders of Chicago propose to get to
gether In an association which alms,
among other things, to regulate and re
duce rents. The means of reducing
rents, according to a prospectus which
became public to-day, is to boycott
"unfair" landlords. By co-operating
with the labor unions it is planned to
prevent deliveries of coal and provisions
to the apartments of renters who per
sist in living upon premises where al
leged exorbitant rates are charged.
The prospectus is as follows:
"To regulate rents and expose rent
raising conspiracies.
"To furnish legal advice to members
and defend them in litigation for their
rights.
"To promote agitation for civic im
provements, such as abolishing sign
boards and other eyesores, for which
landlords receive rent.
An examination showed that one
of the steel braces beneath the stern
had pulled loose and that the rear
end of the car was tilted upward,
throwing the propeller into the upper
works. M. Francois stated the dam
age could be repaired within a few
hours and that, weather permitting,
a flight would be made to-morrow.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 14. â An accident
brought the test flight of the Fran
cois airshiu to an abrupt termination
to-day after the flying: machine had
been in the air fifteen minutes, dur
ing which its dirigibility was not sat
isfactorily demonstrated owing, the
inventor stated, to the absence of the
rudder. The ascension was made at
the end of a rope, and it was an
nounced that the principal object of
the lllg-ht was to test the balance of
the car and ascertain whether the air
ship could be guided by means of the
fans without the use of the rudder.
The airship rose at 3:42 p. m. It
ascended to a height of about 100
feet before its rise was checked by
those holding the guide ropes. In the
car were Hippolite Francois of France,
the inventor and director of the air
ship, and his French engineer, M.
Schneider.
The airship progressed slowly in
a westerly direction, and M. Fran
cois then attempted to turn the flying
machine around. He stopped the
fans on the right side, but though
the pair on the left side revolved
swiftly, there was no perceptible
change in the course of the airship,
and it was dragged around by those
holding the ropes. ':â¢
Shortly after this a sharp, break
ing noise was heard, and a fewfBec
onds later one of the stern propellers
struck the upper framework several
hard blows, breaking' the propeller
and splintering several of the under
supports. Francois signaled to
those on the ground and the airship
was. pulled down and take,n into the
aerodrome.

CHICAGO, Nov. 14. â Sentiment in the wheat
pit to-day was bearish from start to finish.
The Impossibility of communicating with the
Eastern seabcard by wire tended to make >ji
tame session. In the absence of any news
from foreign markets local longs were In
clined to take profits. Initial quotations on
December were off %Â®^c at $1 14. May was
lower to a shade higher at $1 13*s@l H'v
Influenced by a small movement in the North
west shorts Immediately after the opening
covered quite freely. The result was an ad
vance to $1 14 % for December. May sold up
to $1 14'4. The market, however, soon yielded
to persistent liquidation, and prices steadied
on a gradual decline. Reports from, the South
west wert bearish, a message from Oklahoma
City claiming that acceptance of wheat there
was the largest In six weeka. St. Louis also
reported a poor demand for cash wheat. At
$1 13 %, December touched the low point of
the day. The bottom on May was reached at
$1 13V*. Just before the close there waa some
buying on a report of frosts in Argentina. In
consequence the market made a slight recov
ery, but the ton* at the close was weak.
Final quotations on DÂ«eember were at $1 13%,
a loas of 7 *c- May closed "%o lower at
$1 13H-
In the corn pit weakness of wheat and In
creased movement of the new crop and lack
of outside support caused an easier tone. De
cember closed J 4 c lower at 50%c.
Trading In oats was exceptionally quiet and
prices fluctuated within exceedingly narrow
limits. December closed H'iUc lower at 2Ss;i
0200.
Influenced by liberal receipts of hogs and
low price* at the yards, local packers were
free sellers of lard and as the result prices
of ail hog products showed losses. At the
close January pork was off 7%@10c, at
$12 67%; lard was down 10c, at $7 07^4. and
ribs were BQ-74e lower, at (6 32%@Â« 55.

*uffceÂ»Uve of a narrow margin for the busi

Recently several million dollars
were Invested by capitalists in dredge
mining lands along the Yuba River,
from four to nine miles east of Marys
ville, where vast quantities of gravel
and sand from the hydraulic mines
filled the old river "channel. To get at
the former channel the dredgers
moved all the accumulated debris. It
is feared by some that much of this
debris will drift down stream and add
to the already deplorable conditions
existing here and farther down the
valley.
MARYSVILLE. Npv. 14. â A public
meeting has been called for Saturday
afternoon at the City Hall for the
purpose of considering the dredge
mining question. George Hutchins,
Howard Reed, T. B. Hull, B. F. Wal
ton and Cline Bull, all prominent
farmers of Yuba and Sutter counties,
signed the call. If, sufficient cause ia
found legal steps to stop this method
of mining: or place It under restric
tions will be undertaken. It was here
the fight against* hydraulic mining
started. The people are apparently
not yet very decided whether dredge
mining is injurious, but the steps now
being taken are expected to settle the
matter.
Citizcns of Marysvillc Call Meeting to
Discuss Question of Great
Importance.
The proponents wpre not taken by
eurprise, however, and in the cross
examination, which was pressed with
vigor. Mrs. Phillips admitted that she
had tried to induce the executors to
. make allowance to her of $25,000. She
Jelt she had been dealt with very un-
Mrr. Elizabeth C. Phillips, bene
ficiary under Bertha Dolbeer's will to
the amount of $10,000, declared to the
jury in Judge Coffey's court yesterday
that the tPFtatrix was of unsound mind
xvhen Fhe made disposition of her es
tate. Mrs. Phillips was a cou?in of
John Dolbeer. the father of Miss Dcl
beei, and wat one of the few relatives
that the yÂ« ung heiress remembered In
her testament.
To the casual observer this testimony
in behalf of the contestants came like
h thunderbolt from the blue. Should
the fctatemer.ts of the witness be con-^
vincin^ to the jury â should the wilf
bet pet apide and the law of succession
made to applyâ Mrs. Phillips would not
be entitled to a cent of the $1,000,000
estate. In other words, it looked as if
ehe were trying to destroy her legacy
of $10,000. And she stated frankly that
In her old age her chief ambition was
now to get money enough for herself
and husband to live on. But she had
been compelled to come to court, she
said, and once on the stand must tell
the truth of Miss Dolbeer's condition,
no matter the consequences.
Upon the death of Mrs. Dolbeer, John
Dolbeer 6ent for the witness, who
thereupon took charge of and con
ducted his household for six years, tak
ing care of the children. Chase and
Bertha, the latter beinsr about two
years of aee at. her mother's death.
In. the last vear of her life Miss Dol
beer developed much restlessness,
seemed very, much depressed, com
plained of pains in the back of her
head and of insomnia, Mrs. Phillips
related a number of circumstances and
then in answer to a question of coun-
Mrs. Phillips also testified that Mrs.
Dolbeer, Miss Dolbeer's mother, was in
sane when she took her own life in
1879 and that a brother of John Dol
beer, who lived in Massachusetts, was
mentally unsound. The court refused
to entertain depositions of others in
regard to these matters. :-.;' Â¦"'.
ACTED PART OF MOTHER.
The witness denied that she had
made threats, although she virtually
admitted that she tried to force a set

from the contestant. Not a word was said
about that. Mr. Gray said John Dolbeer ought
to have given me ?10O,00O, but he himself
could do nothing for me, although he said if
the opportunity should present Itself he would

advised me to talk as little as possible and
not to go near the Johnsons.
Did you not ask him to speak to Miss War

I did not. 1 deny it.
Did you not say to Mr. Gray and Mr. Wll

It was money you wanted and that you would

I never said it; I never said It. I did say

DREDGE MINING CAUSE

Jules Clerfayt, local agent of the
Trans-Siberian Railway, has returned
from a business trip to the East, which
included a visit to the St. Louis Ex
position.
' Charles S. Hardy of San Diego, who
is prominent in politics in his home
county, is at the Palace. He Is here

John McNaueht of Liverpool is reg

J. E. Stubbs, president of the Nevada
State University, is at the Palace.
Grant Snvder, a well-known mining
man of Kennet, is at the Palace.
Adjutant General J. B. Lauck is
down from Sacramento and is staying
at the Occidental.
Attorney T. C. Van Ness, acting for
Fredericks, was confident the matter
would be adjusted satisfactorily.
George Fredericks filed an attach
ment against the West Coast Rubber
Company yesterday, for the sum of
$48,774, part of which he claims is
the value of stock owned by him in
the concern. The rest he says is
back salary due him as president and
manager. The other stockholders in
the company~are H. W. Goodajl and
J. H. Bennett, of the firm of Goodall
& Bennett. Goodall makes the fol
lowing statement:
"In February, 1902, my partner and
I, thinking Fredericks knew all about
the rubber business, went in with him
in the West Coast Rubber Company,
at 32 Fremont street. Fredericks was
made president. We soon began to
think that he was not competent. In
May the board of directors appointed
Don A. Sutherland manager of the
concern and found that the com
pany was out to the extent of $19,000.
We took stess to remove Fredericks
from office. lie got an injunction re
straining that move, but it was after
ward vacated by Judge Seawell and
we removed Fredericks from the
presidency of the company. Since
then the West Coast Rubber Com
pany has been making money. We
suppose that Fredericks' chagrin at
the removal inspired his action. He
did not ask us, for any settlement or
statement. He has advanced to the
corporation about $22,000, and my
partner and I have expended about
the same amount."

RUBBER COMPANY ATTACHED
BY ITS FORMER PRESIDENT
H. A. L. da Silva was brought be
fore United States Commissioner Man
ley yesterday by Judson Brusle, agent
of a surety company, which had gone
on his bonds for $5000 on the charge
of importing Chinese women to this
country for immoral purposes. Mr.
Brusie . wanted to surrender the
prisoner and have the bonds released,
but Mr. Manley took the stand that
the prisoner should be surrendered to
Judge de Haven in open court. Judge
do -Haven had already adjourned the
District Court until this morning. Da
Silva was then taken before United
States Commissioner Heacock, who
also refused to receive him, and Da
Silva was taken back to the City
Prison for safe keeping.
"I don't see why they want to keep
me locked up during the Christmas
holidays, for my trial can't begin until
January," said Da Silva. "I" think
I've been given the double cross."
Lee Toy* who was arrested at the
same time and on the same charge,
is out on bail.

her that they were mountain trout. The

and Judge Fritz gave him thirty days.
The prosecuting policeman hinted that
Mr. Brennan was also strongly suspect

wild ducks.
Charles Rupert of 20 Sutter street,
Joseph Meyers of 105 O'Farrell street

John Preston, a barber, created so
much confusion while he was at work
last Saturday evening in Mose Harris'
tonsorial parlor, 250 Eleventh street,
that he was arrested for disturbing the
peace. In jocular spirit, alleged to have
been of alcoholic inspiration, he shout
ed "Next!" and when response was
made by one of many waiting custom
era he laughed heartily at the ensuing
embarrassment, as no chair was emp
ty. It was also testified that he
"sassed" his employer and "joshed" the
helpless ones who fell Into his clutches.
When he expressed sorrow for what he
had done'and promised to abstain from
repeating his. unprofessional conduct
Judge Mogan dismissed him.

' Kate Atherton and May Harris be
came so mutually attached while in the
County Jail that they decided to.con
tinue the sisterly relationship when re
stored to freedom, and a few hours
after their release last Saturday they
were arrested together for drunkenness.
Kate, being the oldest offender, got six
months from Judge Fritz, while May's
punishment will expire at the end of
thirty days.
Mrs. E. C. Campbell of 119 Jones
street, whose 14-year-old daughter, Lo
rella, was shamefully treated by 20
year-old W. A. Proll of Oakland, was
averse to making formal complaint be
cause of the undesirable notoriety it
would bring upon the girl and herself.
Judge Mogan. however, considered the
case too serious to be thus disposed of,
and informed the woman that if she
did not prosecute the defendant .the po
lice would do so, as the evidence showed
that his betrayal of the child was un
usually reprehensible. On pretext of
taking her to the theater last Saturday
night he enticed her to Golden Gate
Park. Finally the mother consented to
swear to a complaint and the case will
be heard to-day. The girl's father is in
Alaska.
Mary Napoleon, accused of vagrancy
and sentenced to thirty days' impris
onment by Judge Fritz, confessed that
she had adopted the surname, not be
cause she was of French nativity or
even descent, but because it had a nicer
sound than either her maiden name of
Budd or her husband's cognomen, which
was Mack.
"For what's the use," she asked, "of a
girl having an ugly name when there
are so many nice ones to pick from?"
After four female adults had suc
cessively talked until Judge Cabaniss
silenced them, Miss Kate Robbins as
cended the witness stand and tempo
rarily dumfounded the court by an
nouncing that she had nothing to say.
When the Judge falterinsrly asked her
why she had nothing to say there
came no answer and there was won

pressed in his Honor's glance as he
told her she might step down.
Mrs. Kate Reardon, relict of a po

story of 522 Capp street, was accused
by Mrs. Hattie Hinkle, her downstairs
neighbor, of maligning character.
Miss E. Hlppenbacher also complain
ed of having been slandered by Mrs.
Reardon. Of all the ladies Miss Rob
bins was the only one afflicted with
reticence. The case was dismissed.
It is the wont of the French master
mariners In port to assemble for so
cial intercourse each Sunday after
noon aboard some vessel flying their
nation's flag.
Day before yesterday the Guetary,
moored . to the Filbert-street wharf,
was thus honored. With pipe and
glass and yarn and chanson the skip
pers were hugely enjoying themselves
when Gaston, the cook, suddenly
shocked the amenities by demanding
that each gentleman present hand
over to him the sum of 50 cents.
When the guests recovered sufficiently
from their astonishment to realize
that the custodian of the galley was
not joking they advanced upon him
as one man to wreak punishment for
his outrageous breach of the keystone
principle of seagoing social usage.
'Tvves then he drew his knife to de
fend himself. Captain Sawtrell. in the
vanguard, had a small slice of cuti
cle removed from his hand ere the
cook was disarmed and turned into
the custody of a harbor policeman.
Gaston pleaded that he failed to
see his offense in the light of enormity
cast upon it by the prosecution. "Zey

With tongue, hands and shoulders
simultaneously expressive of indigna
tion, three French shipmasters in turn
informed Police Judge Mogan that
the charge of assault with a deadly
weapon was not the most serious ac
cusation provoked by Gaston Sentiell,
cook aboard the bark Guetary. In
addition to brandishing a large and
sharp knife and slightly wounding
Captain Charles Sawtrell of the bark
Marguerite Dollf us, they averred, the
defendant had committed the less
pardonable offense of deliberately vio
lating that code of hospitality which is
cherished more than life, itself by
every true Gallic son of the sea. The
knife-flourishing â aye, even, the
blood-letting â might be overlooked,
but the attempt to extort money from
those who were invited guests of his
captain â there could be no condone
ment of that.

and smote Mr. Kelly's face with a
clenched fist. The assault was wit

Judge Mogan sent four defendants to
the Superior Court, with ball in each
case fixed at $500. They are Mrs. Fran
ces Delphian Forsyth, who fatally shot
the Japanese proprietor of a Montgom
ery avenue shooting gallery; George
Farmer and J. H. Umbach, who stole a
quantity of clothing and jewelry from
J. H. Glocker at 2 Eighth street, and
James Mlchens (colored), who pilfered
a watch from a room in a Pacific street
lodging-house.
H. Katchkuri, a gigantic Japanese,
had three of his compatriots down and
out and was lulling a fourth -one to
sleep by battering his head against a
curbstone on Dupont street when a
policeman stopped the fray- An in

The cross-examination opened brisk
ly with the attempt of the proponents
to show that the witness tried to force
a bonus of $15,000 from the executors,
to be added to her bequest of $10,000.
George D. Gray, one of the executors,
and his attorney, W. F. Williamson,
were the persons she had approached,
and the examination proceeded as fol
lows :

of George D.. Gray, 421 Market street, say in
the presence of Gray and W. F. Williamson
that you wanted $25,000, the amount Miss
Warren'* mother received, and If you didn't

we should talk about might be used some
time, but that he thought we could agree to
hold It confidential.

Mr. Williamson assured me that anything I
would say would be regarded as strictly con

Mr. Williamson has small honor with his
word.
