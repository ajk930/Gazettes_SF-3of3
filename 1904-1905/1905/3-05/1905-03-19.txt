â¢T OLME? had been seated for
,1\ some hours in silence with his
I I long, thin back curved over .- a
*â¢) chemical vessel in which he was .
â¢* brewing a particularly malodo
rous product. His head was sunk upon
his breast, and he ' looked from my
point of view like a strange," lank bird*,
' n'ith dull gray plumage and a. black
top-knot. .
"So, Watson," said he, suddenly, "you
'do not propose to invest in ' South Afri
ta'n securities?" ' : '
I cave a start of astonishment. Ac
customed as I was jto Holmes', curious
faculties, this sudden intrusion into my
most Intimate thoughts was utterly in
explicable.
"How on earth do you know that?"
I asked.
He wheeled round upon his stool,
with a steaming test-tube in his hand
and a gleam of amusement in his deep
set eyes.
"Now, Watson, confess yourself ut
terly taken aback," said he.
"I am." â¢
"I ought to make you sign a paper
to that effect."
Why?" -
"Because in five minutes you will
say that ft Is all so absurdly simple."
, "I am sure that I shall say nothing
of the kind."
"You see, my dear Watson" â he
propped his test-tube in the rack and
began to lecture with the air of a pro
fessor addressing his class â "It . is . not
really difficult to construct a series of
inferences, each dependent upon its
predecessor and each simple in itself. .
If. after, doing so, one : simply knocks
out all the central; Inferences, and pre
sents one's audience with the starting
point and the conclusion, one may pro
duce a start! ' though possibly' a
meretricious effect. â¢ Now, it .was- not
â really difficult, by an inspection of ; the
groove between your left forefinger
and thumb, to feel sure that you. did
not propose to- Invest. your small capi
ta! in the : goldfields." â¢ i V Â» -
"I see iv > connection." * .Â«.,',. ..â¢ â¢ â¢
"Very likely not; but . I rf can quickly
show you a- close connection.' - Here- are
the missing links of the 'very , simple
chain: l. You had a chalk between your
left finger and thumb â¢ when ::â  you re
turned from the club last night.'. 2. You
put chalk there 'when you 1 play 'bil
liards to steady the cue. 3. You never ;
play billiards . except with - Thurston.. 4.
You tojd me, 1 four weeksiago, that
Thurston had 'â  an ! option â¢ on 'some : South
African Drooerty which would ; expire

in a month, and which he desired you
to share with him. 5. Your check
book is locked in my drawer and you
have not asked for the key. 6. You do
not propose to invest your money in
this manner."
"How absurdly simple!" I cried.
'Quite so!" said he, a little nettled.
"Every problem becomes very childish
when once it is explained to you. Here
is axi unexplained cfoe. See what you
can make of that, friend Watson." He
tossed a sheet of paper upon the table
and turned once more to his chemical
analysis.
I hnrked with amazement at the
absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper.
"Why, Holmes, It is a child's draw
ing." I cried.
"Oh, that's your idea!"
'What else should it be?"
"That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt of
Riding Thorpe Manor, Norfolk, is very
anxious to know. This little conun
drum came by the first post, and he
was to follow by the next train. There's
a ring at the bell, Watson. I should
not be very much surprised if this
were he. '
A heavy step was heard upon the
stairs and an instant later there en
tered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gen
tleman, whose clear eyes and florid
cheeks told of a life led far from the
fogs' of Baker street. He seemed to
a whiff of his strong, fresh,
bracing, east-coast air with him as he
entered. Having shaken hands with
each of us, he was about to sit down,
when his eye rested upon the paper
with the curious markings, which I
had just examined and left upon the
table.
"Well, Mr. Holmes, what do yon
make of these?" he cried. "They told
me thjtt you were fond of queer mys
teries, and I don't think you can find
a queerer one than that. I sent the
paper on ahead so that you might have
time to study it before I came."
"It is certainly rather a curious pro
duction," said Holmes. "At first sight
it would appear to be some childish
prank. It consists of a number of ab
surd little figures dancing across the
paper upo which they are drawn.
Why should you attribute any import
ance to so grotesque an object?"
"I never should, Mr. Holmes. But
my wife does. It is frightening her to
death. She says nothing, but I can see
terror in her eyes. That's why I want
to sift the matter to the bottom."
Holmes held up the paper so that the
sunlight shone full upon It. It was a
page torn from a note-book. The
markings were done in pencil and ran
in this way:
Holmes examined it for some time,
and then, folding it carefully up, he
placed it in his pocket-book.
"This promises to be a most interest
ing and unusual case," said ho. "You
gave me a few particulars in your let
ter, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, but I should be
very much obliged if you would kindly
go over it all again for the benefit of
my friend. Dr. Watson."
"I'm not much of a story-teller," said
our visitor, nervously clasping and un
clasping his . great, strong hands.
"You'll just ask me anything that I
don't make clear. I'll begin at th*
time of my marriage last year, but I
want to say first of all that though I'm
not a rich man, my people have been
at Hiding Thorpe for a matter of five
centuries, and there is no better known
family in the county of Norfolk. Last
year I canu? up to London for the
Jubilee, and I stopped at a boarding
house In Russell square, because Park
er, the vicar of our parisn, was stay
ing in it. There was an American
young lady there â Patrick- was â  the
name â Elsie -Patrick. '.'ln some 'way'we
became friends, until before my month
was up I was as much In love as man
could be. We were quietly married at
a registry office, and v,e returned to
Norfolk a wedded couple. You'll think
it very mad. Mr. Holmes, that a man
of a. jcood old family should marry a
wire in this fashion, Knowing nothing
of her past or of her people, but if you
saw her and k.new her it would help
you to understand.
"She was very straight about it, was
Elsie. I cant say that she did not
give me every chance of getting out
of it if I wished to do so. "I have had
some very disagreeable associations in
my life,' said she; 'I wish to forget all
about them. I would rather never
allude to the past, for it is very pain
ful to me. If you take me, Hilton, you
will take a woman who has nothing
that she need be personally ashamed
of, but you will have ' to bo content
with my word for it, and to allow me
to be s:ltnt as to all that passed up to
the time when I became yours. If
these conditions are too hard, then go
back to Norfolk and leave me to the
lonely life in which you found me.' It
was only the day before our wedding
that she said those very words lo me.
I told her that I was content to take
her on her own terms and I have been
as good as my word.
"Well, we have been married now
for a year and very happy we have
been. But about. a month ago, at the
end of June, I saw fc-r the first time
signs of trouble. One day my wife re
ceived a letter from America. I saw
the American stamp. She turned
deadly white, read the letter and threw
it In,to the fire. She made no allusion
to it afterward, and I made none, fflr a
promise is^-a promise, but she has
.never known an easy hour from that
moment. There is always a look of
fear upon her face â a look as if she
v/ere waiting and expecting. She would
â do better to trust me. She would
find that I was her best friend. But
until she speaks I can say nothing.
Mind you, she is a truthful woman,
Mr. Holmes, and whatever trouble
there may have been In her past life
it has been no fault of hers. I am
only a simple Norfolk squire, but there
is not a man in England who ranks his
family honor more highly than I do.
She knows it well, and she knew it
well before she married me. She would
never bring any stain upon It â of that
I am sure. 4
"Well, now I came to the queer part
of my story. About a week ago â It
was the Tuesday of last week â I found
on one of the window-sills a number of
absurd little dancing figures like these
upon the paper. They were scrawled
with chalk. I though that it was the
'stable-boy who had drawn them, but
the lad swore he knew nothing about ,
it. Anyhow, they had come there dur
ing the night. I had them washed out
and I only mentioned the matter to my
wife afterward. To my surprise she
took it very seriously and begged me
if any more came to let her see them.
None did come for a wÂ«Â»k and then
yesterday morning- 1 found thlg naper^

He was a fine creature, this man ;of

i. We " had "not"'lons." not"'lons. to wait, for our

and depressed, with tired eyes and; a â¢
lined forehead:. â¢
Â» "It's getting on my nerves, this busi

like a wearied man, into an armchair.
"It's; bad . enough to feel A that * you are

â â '"Al' good ? deal, ; Mr. Holmes. I hayÂ»
several fresh dancing men pictures for

important, I . have i seen the - fellow."
. "What, the â¢ man , who draws; them?"
."Yes/ I saw him' at his work. .. But I
will tell you everything In order. When

[. very 'â > first â ; thing :' I Â« saw next [ morning
was a fresh crop of dancing men. They

."Three days Â« later . a message was left

* a pebble upon 1 the sundial." Here it s Is.
â¢/" The characters are. as you set?, exactly â 
i the same as the' last one. After that I ?
determined to lie in wait, so I got out
t my. revolver and I sat up in my study,
fwhich -overlooks the.lawn, and garden.
â¢ About two in the morning I .was seat-
! ed by the window, all-being; dark save
7 for the moonlight outside, whan -I
i- heard ; steps Â» behind ima and jj there- was j
â¢my â¢ yiVtpj in her ? dresging-s,Qwn. She -implored me to come to bed. 1 told
her frankly that I wished to see who it
â¢was who played such absurd tricks
upon us. She answered that it was
some senseless practical joke and that
I should not take any notice of it.
"'lf it really annoys you, Hilton, we
might go and travel, you and I, and so
avoid this nuisance.'
"'What, bo driven out of our own
house by a practical joker?' said I.
'Why, we should have the whole coun
ty laughing at us.'
â¢ " "Well. come to bed,' said she, 'and
we can discuss it in the morning.' .. i.
" "Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her
white face grow whiter yet in the
moonlight, and her " hand tightened
upon my shoulder. Something was
moving in the shadow of the tool
house. I saw a' dark, creeping figure
which crawled round the corner and
squatted in front of the door. Seizing
my pistol, I was rushing out, when my
â wife threw her arms round me and
held me with convulsive strength. 1
tried to throw. her off. but she clung
to me most desperately. At last 1 got
clear, but by the. time I had opened the
door and reached the house the,crea
ture was gone. He had left a trace of
his presence, however, for there" on the
door was the very same:' arrangement
of dancing men vvhjch had -already
twice appeared and which 1 -have
copied on that- paper. Then was no;
trther sign of thÂ« fellow anywhere.
Though I ran ;:'! over "the grounds. And
yet the amazing thine is that he must
have been there, all the time, for when
1 examined the door again in the
morning he had. scrawled some . more
of his pictures under the line which
I had already seen." \ "'â 'â¢ ."â¢';->:
"Have you .that "fresh drawing'?"-'.' y
"Yes. it is "V try short,, but" I made a"
copy of it, and here it 'is.". s , '" .
Again he produced a paper. The new
dance was in this form: "..'.. . ,;-
"Terr me," said Hc-mcsâand I could
see by Ma eyes that he was 'much ex
cited- "was.this a mere addition to the
rim. ex â¢diii it appear to be. entirely
separate?" . â¢ . - . 'â¢;'.- ,' / ;
"It \vas\on a different panel of the

client: This is far the most im
portant of all for our purpose. â  It fills
me with hopes. Mow, Mr. ' Bitten Cu
bitt, please continue your most inter
esting statement." \4 '-â¢ r. -C
"1 have, nothing more to say, Mr.
Holmes, except that I was angry with
my wife that night for having held me
back when 1! might have caught the
skulking rascal. ; She said that she
feared that I might come to harm. For
an instant it had crossed my mind
that perhaps what she; really feared
was that he might come to harm, for
I could not doubt that she knew who
this man was and what :he meant by
these strange signals. But there is a
tone in my wife's voice, Mr. Holmes,
and a look in her eyes which forbid
doubt, and I am sure that It was in
deed my own safety that was in her
mind. There's the whole case, and
now I want ycrur advice as to what I
ought to do. My own. inclination Is to
put half a dozen of my farm lads in
the shrubbery, and .when this fellow
comes again to give him such a hiding
that he will leave us in peace for the
future."
"I fear it is too deep a case for such
simple remedies." said Holmes. "How
long can you stay in London?"
"I must go back to-day. I would not
leave my wife alone at night for any
thing. She is very nervous and begged
me to come back."
"I dare say you are right. But if
you could have stopped, I might pos
sibly have been able to return with
you in a day or two. Meanwhile you
â will have me these papers, and I think
that it is v.ry likely that I shall be
able to pay you a visit shortly and to
throw some light upon your case."
â Sherlock Hdmes , preserved his- calm
professional manner until our visitor
had left us, although it was easy for.
me, who knew him so well, to see that
he was profoundly excited. The mo
merit that Hilton Cubitfs broad back
had disappeared through the door my
comrade rushed to the table, laid out all
the slips of paper containing dancing
men in front of him and threw himself
into an intricate and elaborate calcu
lation. For two hours I ', watched him
as he covered sheet after sheet of
paper with figures and letters; 6O com
pletely absorbed in his task that he
had evidently forgotten my presence.
Sometimes he was maKing progress
and whistled and sang at his work;
sometimes he was puzzled and would
sit for long spells with a furrowed
brow and a vacant eye. Finally he
sprang from his chair with a cry of
satisfaction, and walked up and down
the room rubbing his hands together.
Then he wrote a long telegram upon
a cable- form. "If my answer to this
is; ac I hope, you will have a very
pretty case to add to your collection,
Watson." said he. "I expect' that we
shall be able to go down to Norfolk
to-morrow and to take our friend some
very definite news as to the secret of
his annoyance."
1 confess that I was filled with cu
riosity, but I was aware that Holmes
liked to make his disclosures at his
own inn** and in his own way, so I
waited until it should suit him to take
me into his confidence.
But thÂ«>re was a delay in that an
swering telegram, and two days of Im
patience followed. during which
Holmes pricked up his ears at every
ring of the bell. 1 On the evening of the
i-eccttd there came a letter from Hilton
Cubitt. AH was quiet with him. save
that a long inscription had appeared
that morning upon the pedestal of the
sundial. He Inclosed â¢ a copy of it,
â which is here reproduced:
Holniâ¬K bent over this grotesque
frieze for Mpe minutes, and then sud
denly sprang to his feet with an ex
< lamation of surprise and dismay. His
face Â«TM haggard with anxiety.
"We have let this affair go far
enough." said he. "Is there a train
â¢h Waisham to-night?"
1 turned up the time-table. The last
had just gone.
"Then we shall breakfast early and
take the very first ir the morning,"
paid Holmes. "Our presence is most
urgently needed. Ah: here is our ex
pMtad cablegram. One moment, Mrs.
Hudson, there- may be an answer. No,
that is quite as I expected. Thie mes
sage makes it even more essential that
ho-uld not lose an hour in letting
Hilton cubitt know how matters stand,
for it is a singular and a dangerous
web in which our simple Norfolk squire
is entangled."
So. indeed, it proved, and as I come
to the dark conclusion of a story which
had seemed t<Â» me to be only childish
and bizarrf, I experience once again
the ditniay and horror with which I
wai- filled. Would that 1 had Borne
brighter ending to communicate to my
readers, but these are the chronicles of
fact and I must follow to their dark
crisis the strange chain of events
â which Pot some days made Riding
Thorpe Manor a household word
through the length and breadth of
England.
We hed hardly alighted at North
Waisham and mentioned the name of
our destination when the station-mas
ter hurried toward us. "I suppose tftat
you are the detectives from London?"
said he.
A annoyance passed over
Holmes' face.
"Whwi makes you think such a
thinj.
*tjfctmVK Inspector Martin from
Norwich has just passed through. But
maybe you are the surgeons. She's
not deadâ or wasn't by last accounts.
You may be in time to save her yet â
though it be for the gallows."
Holmes' brow was dark with anxiety.
"We are going to Riding Thorpe
Manor," said he, "but we have heard
nothing of what has passed there."
â  Its a terrible business," said the
station-master. "They are shot, both
Mr. Hilton Cubitt end his wife. She
shot him and then herself â so the ser
vants say. He's dead and her life is
despaired of. Dear, dear, one of the
oldest families in the County of Nor
folk, and one of the most honored."
Without a word Holmes hurried to a
carriage and during the long seven
miles' drive he never opened his mouth.
Seldom have I seen him so utterly cie
spondent. He had been uneasy during
all our journey from town and I had
observed that he had turned over the
morning papers with anxious atten
tion, but now this sudden realization
of his worst fears left him in a blank
speculation. Yet there was much
around to interest us, ror we were
passing through ns-EinguTar a conntry
side as any in Englarfd, where a few
scattered outages represented the pop
ulation of to-day, while on every hand
enormous - square-towered chuiches
bristled up from the flat, green land
scape and told of the glory and pros
perity ut old East Anglia, At la-st the
violet ' rim -,of the German Ocean ap
peared ov.or the green edge erf the Nor
loLk coast, and the driver pointed with
hfs whiu to two old brick and timber
gambles which projected from a grove
rof trees. "That's Riding Thorpe Man
or,'- 1 said tie.
As we drove up to the porticoed front
door. 1 observed in front of it, beside
the tennis -lawn, the black tool-house
and the pedestaled sundial with which
we had such strange associations. A
dapper little man, with a quick, alert
manner and a waxed mustache had
just descended from a high dog-cart.
He intrc-duced himself as Inspector
Martin of the Norfolk Constabulary,
and lie was considerably astonished
when he heard the name of my com
panion.
Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was
only committed at 3 this morning.
How could you hear of it in Lc-ndon
and Â£.et to the spot as soon' as I?"
"1 anticipated if. I came in the hope
of preventing it."
"Then you must have important evi
dence, of which we are ignorant," for
tiiey were said to be a most united
couple."
"I have only the evidence of the
dancing men." Bald Holmes. "I will
explain the matter to you later. Mean
while, since it is too late to prevent
tbie tragedy, I am very anxious that I
should use the knowledge which I pos
sess in order to insure that justice be
done. Will you associate me in your
investigation or will you prefer that
1 shcruld act independently?"
"I should be proud to feel that we
wen acting together, Mr. Holmes,"
said the inspector, earnestly.
"In that case I should be glad to
hear the evidence and to examine the
premises without an instant o-f unnec
essary delay."
Inspector Martin had the good sense
to allow my friend to do things in his
own fashion, and contented himself
with carefully noting the results. The
local surgeon, an old, white-haired
man, had just come down from Mrs.
Hilton Cubitt's room, and he reported
that her injuries were serious but not
necessarily fatal. The bullet had
passed through the front of her brain,
and it would probably be some time
beli/re she could regain consciousness,
dn the Question of whether she had
been shot or had shot herself he wouM
not venture to express any decided
opinion. Certainly the bullet had been
discharged at very close quarters.
There was only the one pistol found
in the room, two barrels of which had
been emptied. Mr. Hilton Cubitt had
been shot through the heart. It was
equally conceivable that he had shot
her and then himself, or that she had
been the criminal, for the revolver lay
upon the floor midway between them.
"Has he been moved?" asked
Holmes.
"We have moved nothing except the
lady. We could not leave her lying
wounded upon the floor."
"How long have you been here, doc
tor?'
"Since 4 o'clock."
"Any one else?"
"Yes, the Constable here."
"And you touched nothing?"
"Nothing."
' "Yo-u have acted with great discre
tion. Who sent for you?"
"The housemaid, Saunders."
"Was it she who gave the alarm?"
"She and Mrs. King, the cook."
"Where are they now?"
"In the kitchen, I believe."
"Then I think we had better hear
their story at once."
The old hall, oak paneled and high
windowed, had been turned into a
court of investigation. Holmes sat in
a great, old fashioned chair, his in
exorable eyes gleaming out of his
haggard face. I could read in them
a set purpose to devote his life to this
quest until the client whom he had
failed to save should at least be
avenged. The trim Inspector Martin,
the old, gray-headed country doctor,
myself and a stolid village policeman
made up the rest of that strange com
pany.
The two women told their story
clearly enough. They had been
r.roused from their sleep by the sound
of an explosion, which had been fol
lowed a minute later by a second one.
They slept in adjoining rooms and
Mrs. King had rushed in to Saunders.
Together they had descended the
stairs. The cfoor of the study was
open and a candle was burning upon
the table. Their master lay upon, his
face in the center of the room. He
was quite dead. Near the window his
wife was crouching, her head leaning
against the wall. She was horribly
wounded and the side of her face was
red with blood. She breathed heav
ily but was incapable of saying any
thing. The passage, as well as the
room, was full of smoke and the
smell of powder. The window was
certainly shut and fastened upon the
inside. Both women were positive
upon the point. They had at once
sent for the doctor and for the con
stable. Then, with the aid of the
groom and the stable boy, they had
conveyed their injured mistress to her
room. Both she and her husband had
occupied the bed. She was clad in
her dress â he in his dressing gown,
over his night clothes. Nothing had
been moved in the study. So far as
they knew there had never been any
quarrel between husband and wife.
They had always looked upon them
as a very united couple.
These were the main points of the
servants' evidence. In answer to In
spector Martin they were clear that
every door was fastened upon the in
side and that no one could have es
caped from the house. In answer to
Holmes they both remembered that
they were conscious of the smell of
powder from the moment that they
ran out of their rooms upon the top
floor. "I commend that fact very
carefully to your attention," said
Holmes to his professional colleague.
"And now I think that we are in a po
sition to undertake a thorough exam
ination of the room."
The study proved to be a small
chamber, lined on three sides with
books and with a writing table facing
an ordinary window, which looked out
upon the garden. Our first attention
was given to the body of the unfor
tunate squire, whose huge frame lay
stretched across the room. His dis
ordered dress showed that he had
been hastily aroused from sleep. The
bullet had been fired at him from the
front and had remained in his body
after penetrating the heart. His death
had certainly been instantaneous and
painless. There was no powder mark
ing either upon his dressing gown or
on his hands. According to the coun
try surgeon the lady had stains upon
her face, but none upon her hand.
"The absence of the latter means
nothing, though its' presence may
mean everything," said Holmes. "Un
i less the powder from a badly fitting
cartridge happens to spurt backward
i one may fire many shots without leav
ing a sign. I would suggest that Mr.
i Cubitt's body may now be removed.
: I suppose, doctor, you have not re
covered the bullet which wounded the
lady?"
"A serious operation will be neces
sary before that can be done. But
there are still four cartridges in the
revolver. Two have been fired and
two wounds inflicted, so that each
bullet can be accounted for."
"So it would seem," said Holmes.
"Perhaps you can .account also for the
bullet which has so qbviously struck
the edge of the trjndow?"
He had turned suddenly, and his
j long, thin finger was -pointing to a hole
which had tfeen drilled through the
lower window sash, about an inch
above the bottom.
"By George!" cried the inspector.
"Ho.w over did you see that?"
"Because I looked for It."
"Wonderful!" said J.h.6. country doc
tor. "You are certainly right, sir.
Then a third shot has been fired, and
therefore 1 a. third person must have
been present. But who could that
, have been, and how could he have got
away?"
"That js the problem which we are
now about to solve," . said Sherlock
Holmes. "You remember, Inspector
Martin, when the servants said that on
leaving their room they were at once
conscious of a smell- of powder, I re
marked that the point was an ex
tremely important one?"
"Yes, air; but I confess I did not
quite follow you."
"It suggested that at the time of the
firing the window as well as the door
of the room had been open. Otherwise
the fumes of powder could not have
been blown so rapidly through the
house. A draught in the room was
necessary for that. Both door and winr
dow were only open for a very short
time, however."
"How do you prove that?"
"Because the candle was not gut
tered."
"Capital!" cried the inspector. "Cap
ital!"
"Feeling sure that the window had
been open at the time of the tragedy, I
conceived that there might have been
a third person in the affair, who stood
outside this opening and fired through
It. Any shot directed at this person
might hit the sash, I looked and there,
sure enough, was the bullet mark!"
"But how carire the window to be
shut and fastened?"
"The woman's first instinct would be
to shut and fasten the window. But
halloa! what is this?"
It wn a lady's handbag which stood
upon the study table â a trim little
handbag of crocodile skin and silver.
Holmes- opened it and turned the con
tents out. There were twenty fifty
pound notes of the Bank of England,
held together by an indlarubber band
ânothing else.
"This must be preserved, for it will
figure in the trial," said Holmes, as he
handed the bag with Its contents to the
inspector. "It is now necessary that
we should try to throw some light upon
this third bullet, which has clearly,
from the splintering of the wood, been
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
fired from inside the room. I should
like to see Mrs. King, the cook, again.
You said, Mrs. King, that you were
awakened by a loud explosion. When
you said that, did you mean that it
seemed to you louder than the second
one?"
"Well, sir, it wakened me from my
sleep, and so it is hard to judge. But
it did seem very loud."
"You don't think that it might have
been two shots fired almost at the
same instant?"
"I am sure I couldn't say, sir."
"I believe that it was undoubtedly
so. I rather think Inspector Martin,
that we have now exhausted all that
this room can teach us. If you will
kindly step round with me we shall
see what fresh evidence the garden has
to offer."
A flower bed extended up to the
study window, and we all broke into an
exclamation as we approached it. The
flowers were trampled down, and
the soft soil was imprinted all over
with footmarks. Large, masculine feet
they were, with peculiarly long, sharp
toes. Holmes hunted about among the
grass and leaves like a retriever after
a wounded bird. Then, with a cry of
satisfaction, he bent forward and
picked up a little brazen cylinder.
"I thought so," said he; "the revolver
had an ejector and here is the third
cartridge. I really think, Inspector
Martin, that our case is almost com
plete." â¢
The country inspector's face had
shown his intense amazement at the
rapid and masterful progress of
Holmes' Investigation. At first he had
shown some disposition to assert his
own position, but now he was over
come with admiration and ready to
follow without question wherever
Holmes led.
"Whom do you suspect?" he asked.
"I'll go into that later. There are
several points in this problem which I
have not been able to explain to you
yet. Now that I have got so far I had
best proceed on my own lines and then
clear the whole matter up once and
for all."
"Just as you wish, Mr. Holmes, so
lojig as we get our man."
"I have no desire to make mysteries,
but it is impossible at the moment of
action to enter into long and complex
explanations. I have the threads of
this affair all in my hand. Even if this
lady should never recover conscious
ness we can still reconstruct the events
of last night and insure that justice
be done. First of all I wish to know
whether there Is any inn in this neigh
borhood known as 'Elrige's?' "
The servants were cross-questioned,
but none of them had heard of such a
place. The stable boy threw a light
upon the matter by remembering that
a farmer of that name lived some
miles off in the direction of East Rus
ton.
"Is it a lonely farm?"
"Very lonely, sir."
"Perhaps they have not heard yet of
all that happened here during the
night ?"
"Maybe not, sir."
Holmes thought for a little and then
a curious smile played over his face.
"Saddle a horse, my lad," said he.
"I Bhall wish you to take a note to
Elrige's farm."
He took from his pocket the various
slips of the dancing men. With these
in front of him he worked for some
time at the study table. Finally he
handed a note to the boy, with direc
tions to put it into the hands of the
person to whom it was addressed, and
especially to answer no questions ' of
any sort which might be put to him.
I saw the outside of the note, ad
dressed Jn straggling, irregular charac
ters, yery unlike Holmes; usual pre
cise hand. It was consigned to Mr.
Abe Slaney, Elrige's farm, East Rus
ton, Norfolk.
"I think. Inspector," Holmes re
marked, "that you would do well to
telegraph for an escort, as, if my cal
culations prove to be correct, you may
have a particularly dangerous prisoner
to convey to the county jail. The boy
who takes this note could no doubt for
ward your telegram. If there is an
afternoon train , to town, Watson, I
think we should do well to take it, as
I have a chemical analysis of some in
terest to finish' and this investigation
draws rapidly to a close."
"When the youth had been dispatched
with the note Sherlock Holmes gave
his instructions to the servants. If
any visitor were to call asking for Mrs.
Hilton Cubitt no information should be
given as to her condition, but he was
to be shown at once into the drawing
room. He impressed these points
upon them with the utmost ear
nestness. Finally he led the way into
the drawing-room, with the remark
that the business was now out of our
hands, and that we must while awav
the time as best we mieht until we
could see what was in store for us.
The doctor had departed to his pa
tients, and only the inspector and my
self remained.
"I think that I can help you to pass
an hour in an interesting and profit
able manner," said Holmes, drawing
his chair up to the table and spread
ing out in front of him the various pa
pers upon which were recorded the an
tics of the dancing men. "As to you.

so Jit was' reasonable to \ set 1 this down
as E. -- It is true that in I some cases the

the way in which H the flags were dis
tributed, that they were, used to break
the sentence up into words. I accepted
:', this as 'a ; hypothesis and noted that E
was represented by â â

very ! nearly abreast of each other, and
it would be an endless task to try each

material. In my second interview with
Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me

correct we are now able to say that the
symbols
stand respectively for X, V and R. â¢
"Even now I was/in considerable dif

occurred â¢to me that"if â¢ these appeals

contained two;E's with three letters ,

found that such a combination formed
the termination of the message which
was three times repeated. It was cer
tainly some- appeal to 'Elsie.' In this
way I had got my L, > and I. But'
what appeal . could it be? There were
only four letters in the word which
preceded 'Elsie,' and It ended in E.
Surely, the j word must be 'COME.' I *
tried all other *. 'our t letters ending ;in :

Inspector Martin and I had listened
with the utmost ; interest to the full
and clear account of how my friend
had produced results which had led
to so compl .c a command over our
difficulties.<wBjABBBnBBB|
"What did you do then, sir?" asked
the '* inspector.; -;
"I had every reason to suppose that
this Abe Slaney was an American,
since Abe :is an American contraction,
and: since â¢ a letter.-, from America â â  had
been the starting point of all the trou
ble. I had also- every: cause to think t
that ." there was some ". criminal r. secret â¢
in the matter. The * lady's ~ allusions to
her past; and her refusal- to take her
husband into â¢ her. . confidence,^, both
pointed in that 1, direction. r I .therefore ;
cabled to my friend, Wilson Hargreave,
of the New York â¢ Police Bureau, who
has more than once 'â  made use "of my
knowledge of London crime. I asked
him whether the name of Abe Slaney
was known to him. | * Here is his reply: .
â¢The most dangerous crook in Chicago."
On the very evening upon which I had
his answer, Hilton . Cubitt. sent me the'
last ; message from ! Slaney. â¢ Working
with known v letters, it took this form:
ELSIE I .RE.ARE TO MEET THY GO. 1
The addition of a P and a D completed
a message which showed me that the
rascal was . proceeding from persuasion

crooks [ of. Chicago ' prepared me to â¢ find
that 'he might â¢ very rapidly }. put â¢. his.

at Elrige's, Is indeed '.the murderer,

A man was. striding up .the path
which led to the door. > He was a tall,
handsome,-^, swarthy fellow, clad. in a
suit of gray flannel, a Panama hat,
a. ; bristling black beard, and a great,
aggressive . hooked [ nose, and . flourish- "
ing a. cane as he walked. SHe swag
gered up the path as if ; the place be

confident peal at the bell. 5 , 'â .;.-.. - '
"I think, gentlemen," said Holmes
quietly, v "that we had i best 7 take iup

â We waited in. silence forJa minuteâ"Â»
one of .â¢ those ". minutes which ' one N- can -
never forget. Then the door opened â 
and the man stepped in. In an instant
Holmes clapped a pistol Ito;, his â  head'
and Martin slipped .the handcuffs : over
his 1 wrists.V; It ; was ' all done so' swiftly <
and; deftly that the fellow was ; helpless
before he knew i that he was attacked. .
He glared^ from one to the other of us
v.ith 1 a pair of blazing black :: eyes.
Then Ihe burst into a bitter laugh."
.'.'Well,'; gentlemen, you 'haver the drop
on me this time. I seem to have knock
ed against something Â» hard. - But 'I.
came here in. answer to a letter j from "â 
Mrs. Hilton Cubitt. Don't tell me that?
she is in this? >; Don't tell "* me I that she -
helped to set a trap for me.'"
. "Mrs. Hilton Cubitt,was seriously in
jured and is at death's door,"
The man gave a : hoarse : cry of grief,
which rang v through the house.
"You're j. crazy!" he cried fiercely.
"It was he that was hurt, not she.
Who would have hurt little Elsie? I
may have threatened her âGod for
give me! âbut I would not have umeh
ed a hair of her pretty head. Take
it back âyou: ;>ay that she is not
hurt.
" She was found, badly wounded, by
the side of her dead husband.
He sank with a deep groan nn the
settee and buried his face ivi v his
face in his manacled hands. For five
minutes he was silent. Then he raised
his face once more and spoke with
the cold composure of despair.
"I have nothing to hide from you
gentlemen," said he. It I shot the
man he had shot at me, and there's no
murder in that. But if ymi think
I could have hurt that woman, then
you don't know either me or her. I
tell you, there was never a aian
n this world who loved a.
woman more than I leved her. I
had a right to her. She was pledged
to me years ago. Wh<> was this Eng
lishman that he should come between
us? I tell you that I had the first
right to her and that I am only claim
ing my own."
-She broke away from your influ
ence when she found the man that
you are, 1 said Holmes sternly, 'dhe
fled from America to avoid you, and
she married an honorable gentleman
in England. You .legged her and fol
lowed her and made her life a misery
â  to her. in order to induce her to aban
don the husband whom she loved and
respected in order to fly with you,
whom she feared and hated. You
have ended by bringing about the
death of a noble man and driving his
wife to suicide. This is your record
in this business, Mr. Abe Slaney, and
you will answer for it to the law."
"If Elsie dies, I care nothing what
becomes of me." said the American.
He opened one of his hands and
looked at a note crumpled up in his
palm. "See here, mister," he cried,
with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes,
"you're not trying to scare me over
this, are you? If the lady Is hurt as ,
bad as you say. who was it that wrote *
this note?" He tossed it forward on
to the table.
"I wrote it to bring you here."
"You wrote it? There was no one
on earth outside the Joint who knew
the secret of the dancing men. How
cam* you to write it?"
"What one man can Invent another
can discover," said Holme*. 'There
is a cab coming to convey you to Nor
wich, Mr. Slaney. But, meanwhile,
you have time to make some small
reparation for the Injury you have
wrought. Are you aware that Mrs.
Hilton Cubttt has herself lain under
grave suspicion of the murder of her
husband and that it was only my pres
ence here and the knowledge which
I happened to possess which saved net
from the accusation? The least that
you owe her is to make it clear to
the world that she was in no way.
directly or indirectly, responsible for
his tragic end."
"I ask nothing better," said thÂ«
American. "I gueÂ« the very best
case I can make for myself is the ab
solute truth."
"It i 3 my duty to warn you that it
will be used against you," cried the
Inspector, with the magnificent fair
play of the British criminal law.
Slaney shrugged his shoulders.
"I'll chance that," said he. "First
of all, I want you gentlemen to under
stand that I have known this lady
since she was a child. There were
seven of us in a gang in Chicago and
Elsie's father was the boss of the
Joint. He was a clever man. was old
Patrick. It was he who invented that,
writing, which would pass as a child's
scrawl unless you Just happened to
have the key to it. Well. Elsie learned
some of our ways, but she couldn't
stand the business, and she had a bit
of honest money of her own. so she
gave us the slip and got away to Lon
don. She had been engaged to me>
and she would have married me. I
believe, if I had taken over another
profession, but she would have noth
ing to do with anything on the cross.
It was only after her marriage to this
Englishman that I was able to find
out where she was. I wrote to Her.
but got no answer. After that I came
over, and as letters were of no use I
put my messages where she could read
them.
"Well. I have been here a month
now. I lived in that farm, where I
had a room down below, and could
get in and out every night, and
no one the wiser. I tried
all I could to coax Elsie away.
I knew that she read the mes
sages, for once she wrote an answer
under one of them. Then my temper
got the better of me and I began to
threaten her. She sent me a letter
then, imploring me to go away and
saying that it would break her heart
if any scandal should come upon her
husband. She said that she would
come down when her husband was
asleep at 3 in the morning and speak
with me through the end window if
I would go away afterward and leare
her in peace. She came down and
brought money with her, trying to
bribe me to go. This made me mad
and I caught her arm and tried to
pull her through the window. A,t that
moment in rushed her husband with ,
his revolver in his hand. Elsie had
sunk down upon the floor and we
were face to face. I was heeled also,
and I held up my gun to scare hint
off and let me get away. He fired and
missed me. I pulled off almost at the
same instant and down he dropped-
I made away across the garden and
as I went I heard the window shut
behind me. That's God's truth, gen
tlemen, every word of it; and I heard
no more about it until that lad came
riding up with a note which made me
walk in here, like a jay, and give my
self into your hands."
A cab had driven up while the
American had been talking. Two uni
formed policemen sat inside. In
spector Martin rose and touched hls
prisoner on the shoulder.
"It is time for us to go."
"Can I see her first?" (ft
"No, she is not conscious. Mr.
Sherlock Holmes. I only hope that, if
ever again I have an important case.
I shall have the good fortune to have
you by my side."
We stood at the window and
watched the cab drive away. As I
turned back my eye caught the pellet
of paper which the prisoner
tossed upon the table. It was the note
with which Holmes had decoyed him.
"See if you can read it. Watson,"
said he. with a smile.
It contained no word, but this little
line of dancing men:
"If you use the code which I have
explained." said HoJmes. 'you wiW
find that it simply means 'Come here
at once.' I was convinced that it was
an invitation which he would not re
fuse, since he could never Imagine
that it could come from any one but
the lady. And so. my dear Watson,
we have ended by turning the dancing
men to good when they have so often
been the agents of evil, and I think
that I have fulfilled my proratoe of
giving you something unusual for
your notebook. Three-forty is our
train and I fai be back
In Baker street for dinner."
Only one word of epilogue. Tha
American. Abe Slaney. was con
demned to death at the winter assizes
at Norwich, but his penalty was
changed to penal servitude in consid
eration of mitigating circumstances,
and the certainty that Hilton Cubitt

MAGDE MOORE
HOW TO TAKE CARE
OF GLOVES
*\ '/â¢* \A, wom*Â»n have gone Clove mad.
f | And pray tell is it any wonder
i I when the simplest morning
J s Â° wn - tne elaborate tailor suit
and the stunr.ing evening frock
all demand long gloves and of an in
finite variety, ' too.
Unfortunately it isn't always a ques
tion of running in and buying a pair
every time one turns about, for that
is just about as often as one needs a,
fresh pair. Instead, it's a matter of
seeing bow lone certain ones may be
eked out. for long gloves are an un
deniable luxury and should be treated
as such.
Ho-w many gloves does a woman need
a season? Well, that's rather a diffi
cult proposition to figure out. for she
can use Quite as many as she can lay
hands on. But "how many can she get
along or." is quite different, Cor it is
an astounding fact but a true one
nevertheless, that the- woman who can
struggle alone with three or four pairs
a season can use two zen quite com
fortably and not feel extravagant,
either.
Of course it stands to reason that the
â woman who possesses less than half
a dozen must be exceedingly careful
and she must handle them with great
respect, fcr gloves, like shoes, or any
other article of apparel for that mat
ter, will double their time of service
if they receive proper care.
There is absolutely no sense or rea
eon these days for putting gloves on
in a hurry and pulling them out of
chape. for every shop furnishes fitters
and It is thsir business to "do their
v.ork deftly and well. But even if
you are in a. hurry never force a new
clove on quickly, or permit It either,
por it stretches out of condition and
is a miserable fit ever afterwards.
This is particularly true of gloves that
, are a. close tit. though gloves for street
f .year are v. om a little loose in order
that the hand may have perfect free
dom, j
Put them on slowly, gently, smooth
ing the kid, and take care to see that
the Â«cams are quite in place. No one
but 'X decidedly care-less . soul ever
dreams of getting them on any old
way and trusting to luck to pull the
twisted side- scams clear around from
the back. And speaking of "puli" re
minds me. Never under any circum
stances pull a glove on, even if you
have worn it any number of times and
consider It a lit subject for the waste
basket. Just as sure as there is a
weak place in it, a r.d it is almost cer
tain to come outside of the clasp, you
will fir.d it and find it with a venge
ance, too. If you must get it on in a
hurry take a gcod grip of the wrist and
pull steadily trom there, tor the rein
forcir.g and . idling will stand it and
you won't have an ugly tear staring
you in the face as a result.
Much depends on the way gloves
are taken off, though to watch the
average person Rank them off you
would never think it. Tugging at the
finger tips is very apt to break the
threads. and 1' It docs nothing else
it makes the kid shiny and old look
ing. Take them over your hand
wrong side out and then turn the
ringers back again at your leisure and
lay them down smooth and straight.
How many people have you seen drag
their gloves off; in a hurry, roll them
up into a ball and throw' them Into
a drawer or on a couch near their
hats? How lons do you imagine
gloves last that way?
â¢ Generally the kid is moist and warm
and it wrinkles and shrivels up, and
the first thing you know tiny pieces
are falling out and you inform the
shop that "these gloves were abso
lutely rotten." Even the best- of
gloves given the best of care wear
out quickly, which is all too soon,
r anyway.
It's an old, old story that a "ititch
in time saves nine." but it is a true
one and holds good, especially with
kid. Mend gloves just as soon as they
show the very first sign of wear or
tear and mend them, by the way. with
cotton rather than silk. Ordinary
rips are easy enough to manage, for
the needle is put in the same holes
and gently drawn together, and the
only precaution that must be taken
is to see that you do not draw the
seam to one side or the other and
make it crooked.
Mending a tear is rather a ticklish
task and one that is in itself quite an
art. occasionally a small piece is
torn from the inside of the thumb
while the rest of the glove is per
fectly good. If it is very small the
beat thing to do is to buttonhole the
edges of the tear and then draw the
buttonholed edges together. This is
strong and neat and it very seldom.
I>ulls out, whereas you might draw
the kid tog-ether any number of times
only to find the hole yawning Impu
dently as soon as the glove is on.
When a niece of kid is set in. the
tiny glove needle, which is only about
two-thirds as long as an ordinary one,
is needed, and, in fact, is almost es
sential, for some needles do far more
harm than good, and instead of draw
ing a hole together seem to take a
vicious delight in making it grow to
astonishing proportions.
More* depends, too, on the way
gloves arc- ke:>t than the average per
son realizes. Nearly every one has a
drawer for ribbons, gloves and laces,
am' all arc thrown in here, there -and
the other place, regardless of color
and with a happy disregard as to
cleanliness as well. Never make the
mistake of keeping white gloves with
any others. They soil quite too eas
ily as it is. and it is folly to let them
rub against darker ones, which are
bound to be more or less Boiled, even
if it is practically invisible. Instead
put them in a box by themselves and
wmp them uli separately in tissue
paper, and thÂ«n and only then arj
you perfectly sure that they will be
fresh and dainty when you have need
of them.
When they are soiled try to clean
them yourself, for you can do it with*
out rubbing and ruffing up the kid,
which seems to be more than profes
sionals can do. If they are very dirty,
and it is a shame to let them get too
awfully black, put them on and wash
your hands in a basin of gasoline, tak
ing care to see that the very finger
tips are quite clean and white in the
scams. After this rinse them quickly
ii some clean gasoline and rub them
dry with ii soft, clean white cloth, for
they are very apt to dry in streaks if
hung up on a line, and even at best
they sometimes stiffen more than is
jilf â â !!(
When you take them from your
hands put them in a clean towel in the
window to sun and air, for there isn't
any one thine more disagreeable ana
distressing than the ordor of gasoline
permeating one's clothing.
Ii there isn't any sun and you want
to wear the gloves in the evening, I'll
tel! you a trick that will rid them of
tlieir odor, but remember and be care
iul. In fact, you must always remem
l - r io be exceedingly careful of gaso
line or naphtha, for both love to get
ir.to mischief and never miss an oppor
tunity if they can help it.
After the gloves have been in the
open air an hour or so and retain a
very faint smell, put them in the oven
and let them stay there for a time
and you will find that a most vigorous
b will be absolutely without re
v ard. But be sure to hang them in
the open before going near the fire
with them and never under any con
ditions clean any articles, much less
gloves on your hands, near a lamp or
fire of any kind. It is far better to
go without gloves one evening than it
is to wear scars all the rest of your
days and to suffer all sorts of tor
irunts in the bargain.
Every woman has a fad when it
comes to perfumery and generally in
dulges her whim to the utmost in this
line. So if you have a perfectly white
sachet or even a scented face powder
sprinkle a little in the palm of your
hand and rub it gently over the gloves.
Two things this will accomplish. The
fragrance will permeate and the shine
that sometimes comes from too much
cleaning will take itself to regions un
known. ,
Unless you are going a great deal
don't make the error of getting and
putting away too many gloves.
Rather buy them fresh and new when
you require them, for gloves that have
been cleaned and laid away always
take It upon themselves to stiffen and
make themselves generally uncom
fortable and disagreeable. Instead get
two pairs and try to make them answer
your purposes. By doing a little think
ing and scheming you can manage to
keep one pair clean and ready for use,
even if the other is considerably the
worse for wear and tear.
A curious rubber has been invented
for cleaning gloves and it erases the
soil from the kid in exactly the same
fashion a pencil rubber erases a mark.
To bo sure, it is decidedly convenient
and a great deal of comfort at times,
but if very much rubbing is necessary
it soon leaves its traces, for it ruffs
the kid up and occasionally even peels
tiny bits off.
Silk glovea are by far the easiest
or.es to handle, for they rub well, if
white, with ordinary soap and water.
If they do not respond quickly a small
soft brush will soon discover the
cause of the trouble and they will soon
be reduced to a state of spotless white.
In using a brush for any cleaning pur
poses let me tell you to be sure and
rub with the grain or weave of the
fabric. That once determined, rub one
v/ay and you can see the color line
moving slowly down and down until
it entirely disappears.
On account of the variety of colors
worn this year there are some brand
new shades in gloves on the market,
and as they are all light .in color the
lassie of to-day will find her hands
.nore than full in her mad endeavor
to be neat. Onion pink is a stunning
tune and so is that beautiful new yel
low that comes nearer hoiiiÂ£ a corn
color than anything else. In fact,
there are shades and shadea, one
newer and smarter than the other,
but alas and alack, none darker and
more serviceable than what we have
been wont to call "evening shades."

J. M. X. â Black etamine is a won

you have enough to make both a
waist and a jacket you will be well
dressed all summer. First of all. make
the skirt round length, as it must an

pleated and falls loose from the
shoulders and ends a few inches above
the belt line. The front is loose also
and may be either double or single
breasted. A high pleated girdle is
worn with the shirt waist instead of a
belt and makes a pretty finish. The
sleeves are more like short kimona
sleeves than anything else I can think
of, and come but little below the el
bow. Their crowning glory is their
wealth of fluff, which is really needed
to complete them. It might not be ji
bad scheme to have both blaftk and
white ruffles, one for dress occasions
and the other for ordinary wear. Such
a suit would be very smart and very
serviceable at the same time. The
waist would b.e pretty made with a
deep collar effect. Try to get a black
insertion dotted with black silk and
put first a piece of material and then
the insertion. Make the collar deep
enough to come off the shoulder and
instead or making it absolutely round
let a tab come from the collar to the
belt line in front. This takes away
the set look and makes the waist
fluffy and soft at the same time. The
sleeves must, of course, be elbow, as
everything new is made that way.
Take a piece of ribbon and have it
pleated and put it about the sleeves at
the elbow.
To make the dividing line, put a
touch of blue around the elbow and see
that the frtUs stand out well on both

of custard, and use it both morning

pimples if you use it often, but I would
not make a practice of it because the
evil will out some place else. If your

Car lton H . Parker
WHEN I landed in London
early In November, amazed
by the bewildering mass of
the city, good fortune had
given me an Introduction to Sidney
Tv>bb. Besides having written the
world's two text books on trade union
ism, Mr. Webb Is the authority In the
London County Council on Educational
work, and, In conjunction with his
wife, Beatrice Webb, is writing a criti
cal history of municipal government in
England, which promises to be epoch
making. So, when Mr. Webb said to
me: "Sooner or later, better sooner,
you must go to Manchester and see the
home oX co-operation; you have no
more right to ignore it than an investi
gating American manufacturer to lg
the existence of English trade
unions; it is too big to overlook; I will
laborers to different places along the
canal.
The negroes are a good natured,
happy, don't care sort of people, fully
realizing the dangers, especially during
the first few years, the work will
bring.
It is said that 135,000 laborers are
buried up in Monkey Hill, the ceme
tery near Colon. During that fearful
year of 1888 42,000 men were buried
there. Although the Government has
made experiments with Chinese and
coolie laborers, the Jamaicans, it was
found, caq bear the hardships of the
climate better than any other laborer.
They require very little to eat; tropical
fruits grow in abundance. They plant
l l^, Ir J yam ' a BOrt of root - which when
boiled tastes not unlike potatoes. A lit
tle yam and a banana or two, some
times a little rice, constitute a laborer's
meal.
Give you a letter to Mr. Grey, the gen
eral secretary of the Co-operative
Lnion," I took the letter gladly and
left for Manchester.
Manchester is a great, gloomy, fog
grimed city of smoke stacks and stone
wharves. It, not London, is the heart
of England. Taking Manchester as a
center, within a thirty-mile radius is a
population of ten millions; London
cannot say the same. Grouped within
a few miles round the city are suburbs
of 100,000 and 160.000, each a powerful
milling community, full of the soul of
hard work, devoid of a leisured class,
and making England commercially
great and to be feared as it has been
for 200 years. In Oldham, with 176,000
people, I was told there do not live
more than 250 who have not worked
with their hands. So, when co-opera
tion selected Manchester for head
quarters, it > had gone to the place
where no socialistic theory is received
with inattention, and where legislation
affecting penny values is worth bitter
fighting. Ride through the endless dis
mal factory Btreets in Yorkshire and
Lancashire, and you know why men
will starve in striking for better hours
or against a reduction in wages. The
two objects compose their entire hori
zon.
In a big brick building in the heart of
Manchester I found the head office of
the Co-operative Uriion, and got my
letter to Mr. Grey. Mr. Webb's name
is a recommendation anywhere in the
English labor world, and within a few
minutes I was In the presence of a
square-faced man In a very brilliant
vest, who was seated at a table
swamped in documents, charts and
printed stuff. In a minute I knew the
union was most assuredly safe In its
secretary. "I think," he said, "you
had better know what we are, and
what we have done, first; then look
around." He reached for the report of
1904, and read: "We number In Eng
land 2,116,127 co-operationists, belong
ing to 1671 societies. To the Co-opera
tive Union belong 1638 of these socie
ties, and these figures relate to this
latter number: The sales in the union,
wholesale and retail societies, in 1903.
were about $445,000,000, with a profit to
consumers of 546,000,000. The English
wholesale house here In Manchester
Eold $100,000,000 worth of goods, with a
profit of only $1,760,000. Notice the
immense saving to the consumer in the
retail business. The production of the
mills and factories belonging to mem
bers of the union- sold for about $40,
000,000 last year. The produce from all
co-operative institutions in the year
was about $80,000,000. The recent!^ or
ganized bank of the Manchester Whole-
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALE,
Bale Society handled $220,000,000. Jn
all the population of England 4.7 P er
cent are members of the Co-operative
Union. Leaving out of consideration
our strength compared with the vol
ume of English business, you- can
easily see that as a unit of absplute
strength we are a powerful factor.
Now go out and putter through our
wholesale department and the offices
here, and when you get full of ques
tions, come back to me."
I was furnished with a guide and
went into an Immense block of brick
buildings, dodging between the drays,
whose teams carried the big "C. W. S."
of the society on their harness. The
three letters were to become very fa
miliar, as they appear on everything
about the plant The wholesale de
partment, exclusive of its productive
work employes, has some 4000 men and
women employed. The establishment
was in appearance like a well ordered
and immense private concern. Respon
sible, well-paid men are In charge, lack
of industry is an immediate cause for
dismissal of a clerk, and a member of
the society is no more entitled to a po
sition than any outside applicant. It
is run on hard business rules. In only
three characteristics are the offices
different from a private firm. First,
they keep in semi-official and sympa
thetic touch with the unions, observing
the union wage standard, and usually
being a "closed" shop. Second, they,
by declaration, promise -extreme sani
tary comfort to all employes, even to

the wholesale department sells to no
retailer except retail co-operative
stores. In English co-operation, as
distinguished from Scotch, no premium
on profits is paid to the laborers, all
of it going to the consumer. Union
wages, or better, are paid, with in
some places a week's holiday a year,
with pay. The society, with great
Arriving at his quarters, the first
thing a negro does is to dig for silver.
As there are no banks in the country
rears ago the laborers buried their sil
rer around their quarters. So many
died that considerable amounts have
been found by their successors and the
search for treasure has become second
nature to the negro.
They are willing workers.' Each
camp has a commissary 'depot, where
supplies are to" be had; the larger
camps have their own slaughter house,
where fresh beef can be obtained.
In case of sickness they are well
taken care of, either at Ancon or at
Colon; every afternoon the "funeral
train," consisting of an engine, ca
boose and boxcar, passe? over the line,
to put the sick in the caboose, the
Scad in the boxcar. AH laborers are
buried at Monkey Hill. A curious
grave on top of this" cemetery can be
seen from the railways, that of "Bohio
Dan," who requested that he be buried
standing up, facing the railroad, track,
so as to see the trains pass. His re
quest was granted.
Old, rusty machinery is being re
paired, tracks are being relald, the lo
comotive's whistle sounds through the
Jupgle.
All along the line of the canal from
Colon to Panama there are magazines
or storehouses filled with machinery
nnd rolling stock, such as dirt cars, lo
re-motives, railroad supplies, etc. One
thousand machinists are at work re
pairing machines, building sidetracks
near Culebra, which win greatly facili
tate the work. The great steam shovels
are excavating at a surprising rate to
the onlooker. Culebra has a peculiar
formation of earth and basalt rock,
which is very hard. Diamond steam
drills bore holes and expert miners dy
namite those portions which cannot be
excavated by dredges or the strong
steam arm of the shovel.
The old Belgian engines are very use
ful here. The trains of cars are run on
a track beside the steam shovels or
dredges, and the dirt is dumped miles
out in shallow-places. The old machin
ery strewn along the canal strip is
valued in all at $18,937,309 43. Think of
it! Near $20,000,000 wc-rtn of scrapiron!
A foundry at the isthmus could do a
fine, remunerative business.
There are rive sections in the "zone"
â Ancon, Empire, where the marine
soldiers are stationed; Gorgona, Buena
Vista and Cristobal. Throughout th' 2
section all laborers are paid in silver.
They earn about $1 50 silver a day, or
75 cents in American money. They are
housed free, and almost every one has
a family. All nations are represented.
There you see the Spanish negro, the
type mostly found; the Martinique dar
ky, with his sweet French accent, and
clearsight, always endeavors to keep
employment continual, and fights
against the disastrous lapses in work
so frequent among private firms.
Co-operation has achieved in material
advancement a growth exceeding even
the enthusiastic dreams of the "Roch
dale Pioneers," and, before discussion of
Its .economic qualities, a short table as
given above is necessary in explaining
the development. The figures are tak
en from the official reports to the Co
operative Congress of 1904, and are en
tirely faithful.
The consolidation of societies gives in
some years (1897, 1903) a false impres
sion of loss in numbers.
Industrial co-operation is a slow fight
of years, stable because time has sea
soned its structure. First be it known
that English co-operation is in no way
connected with Socialism, factory own
ership by the workers or trade union
ism. Each of these three has its
organization. The society is one purely
of consumers, who, through thair cen
tral organization, or by their own local
society, have become factory owners
and operators, curious in the fact that
they make only for themselves.
In 1860 the father of co-operation, the
Rochdale Pioneer Society, published
the following principles, all of which,
with one unfortunate exception* form
the basis for the present organization:
1. All capital shall be of their own
providing.
2. Only pure provisions should be
supplied, and in full measure.
3. Market prices should be charged
and no credit given nor aaked.- â â¢
4. That "profits" should be divided
pro rata upon the amount of pur
chases made by each member.
6. "One member one vote" in man
agement, and equality of sexes.
6. That the management should be
in the hands of officers and commit
tees elected periodically.
7. That a definite percentage of

the Jamaican humming "God Save the
Queen." I asked one of those Jamaican
darkles why he saW "Queen," as Ed
ward was King. The negro would not
believe me until other 3 told him that
hfs Queen was dead. He had been at
the isthmus for fifteen years and of
course never read a paper. More than
70 per cent of the workmen cannot
write, public writers occupying a aeat
at court and doing a remunerative bus
iness.
The bands of laborers are in charge
of white men, generally engineer*. The
men are very willing and polite. A
blacksmith shop on wheels travels up
and down the strip to sharpen and re
pair broken tools. Water boys carry
water for the laborers; the men work
from six to nine, and then breakfast at
ten; they work until eleven and from
two to half-past five p. m. When canal
work is at its height it will require
about 15,000 men. At present there are
3500 laborers busy, not including 1000
mechanics, engineers and others.- One
thousand tons of powder and dynamite
are required to finish Culebra cut.
The idea of cutting the canal across
the isthmus dates as far back as the
sixteenth century. The first actual
survey was made in 1531 by Antonio
Peretra. In the year 1620 San Diego de
Marcado submitted an elaborate report
to the King of Spain, but that monarch
silenced further discussion, saying that
the will of God was made manifest by
the fact that He had created an isth
mus instead of a strait and that it
would be impiety for a man to attempt
to unite the waters of the two oceans
which God had separated. In all at
least twenty-five projects of the kind
have been advanced.
In 1879 two French engineers, Wyse
and Reclus. advanced the proposition
of digging a sea level canal. A con
gress of engineers, scientists and capi
talists met at Paris and, after thor
oughly considering the question, adopt
ed plans. It was estimated that 2,520,
000,000 cubic fset of eartn would have
to be moved and that it could be com
pleted by 1888 at a cost of $125,000,000.
In 1879 M. Ferdinand de Lesseps, who
built the Suez canal in 1868, became
interested in the scheme, and in 1881,
at the head of a company, he com
menced operations.
The company figured on constructing
a sea level canal, and estimated that it
would take eight years and cost $166,
000,006. The company received $260,000,
000; it expendeS $154,000,000 on the isth
mus on excavating, machinery, making
surveys, etc. The directors drew a sal
ary of $50,000 a year each and were al
lowed $50 a day for expenses. At the
company's expense they built residences
costing from $100,000 to $150,000. They
also had Pullman cars that cost $42,000
each and palaces for offices in Paris,
Panama and Colon.
In 1891 the crash came; they failed,
wjth less than two-fifths of the work
done. In 1594 the receiver transferred
the property to a new company, which
obligated itself to complece the canal
and to pay the old stockholders 60 per
cent of the net receipts from the income
derived from tolls until the old stock
holders, numbering more than 200,000,
were fully paid.
With that understanding all tne
profits should be allotted to education.
This constitutes the famous "Roch
dale system" of organization. The
one important violation of this con
stitution by modern co-operationists
is the breaking of provision 3, relating
to the giving of credit. Organized in
the delicate manner that it is, to be
safeguarded by faithfulness among its
rank and file rather than its officers,
this "tick" buying strikes directly at
its heart and, keenly realizing this,
pertain leaders are now arrayed in
Ditter opposition to the rapid spread
ing of credit among the retail dealers.
It is a noteworthy fact that the
early agitators for liberal education in
England were forced to find their en
couragement among the lower classes.
The "definite percentage" proposed
by the poverty stricken "pioneers"
was faithfully kept, being sometimes
3 per cent, but usually 2V> per cent, of
the society's profits. In 1903 $400.
000 was spent for this purpose. The
work includes children's classes,
teachers' classes, university extension
lectures, scholarships, technical
classes, reading-rooms, circulating and
permanent libraries, literary and de
bating societies, concerts and . many
others. It is the greatest of the social
benefits of the movement. I had a
splendid chance to inspect certain co
operative extension courses, and the
interest and attendance at the lectures
would be' a healthy example to some
of the audiences in a fashionable ex
tension center of London's suburbs. It
was a wish to further this interest
that gave purpose for a "woman's or
ganization." and now the Woman's
Co-operative Guild Is an element of
enormous strength in factory sanita
tion investigation and all co-operative
agitation.
The criticism usually directed against
co-operation has been to accuse it of
"profit hunting," of hiding selfishness
under a socialistic mantle. A plain

or . lees than the old company paid for
nine-tenths of the stock of the Panama
Railroad. The new company has had a
small force at work since 1994. but it
has allowed the canal from Bohio to
the coa.ss (Atlantic side) to fill until in
many 1 places it is almost obliterated.
i. On May 3, .1904, . Lieutenant Brooke. ,
U. S. A., furnished the chairman of the 1
Isthmian Canal Company with a copy
of the telegram from Messrs. Pay and
Russell, then in Paris, and also inform
ed the chairman. Admiral "Walker, that
Mr. Renaudin, the director general of
the French new company, had received
instructions from his company to make
delivery of the property. The transfer
was arranged May 1, 1904. at half-past

was executed in French. English and
Spanish, and authenticated by the cer
tificate of Mr. Renaudin.
The United States . Government paid
$40,000,000 for the rights and title to the
canal property, including the Panama
Railroad, and $10,000,000 to the Panama
Government for a perpetual lease of* a
strip of land seven miles wide from
ocean to ocean. It is estimated it will
take nine years to finish the canal at a
cost of about $150,000,000.
Th- canal will be forty-six miles long,
including three and a half miles sea

? These locks are on the location adopt
ed by the French company. . The esti
mated cost of , this flight of double

The Pedro Miguel locks will be simi

an adjacent dam, is $5,496,326.-, ,.-
The Mlraflores lock varies from 18
feet at high tide to 38 feet at mean low
tide. There Is a good foundation for
this lock. A spillway will be required

The estimated cost of this lock is $5 -
720.363. Lake Bohio will be an artificial
lake, covering 31 square miles. Its
waters will be from 55 to 65 feet deep.

sonry, and will cost $9,786,449. >*-'
Alhajuela Lake will cover 5900 acre*,
and will be 165 feet deep. ThÂ» dam will
be i. constructed ' of masonry, and will
take five years to complete, at a cost of
$3,500,000. .It will furnish j motive power
for operating the locks and lighting the

cluding the cities of Colon and Panama
statement of the principle of co-opera
tion would be: "To eliminate the
agencies between himself and the prim*
cost of the essential elements of ie-
Qent human conditionsâ pure food, com
fortable clothing, pensions, etc. "
This seems to allow the criticism, but
the second principle, "To accomplish
this fundamental object by honesty and
fair dealing." vindicates at once the
association. There are few fact
and few stores In Northern England
that have not felt the salutary Influence
of the competition of the roomy, well
ventilated and well-warmed mills and;
stores of the society.
The hours of labor, th? honorable
treatment of employes by foremen, ham
made the work places of the s
much sought after, and the ex.
has helped where legislation has
powerless. There are 97,321 employ**
of societies in the union, who rec-
in 1903 $17,700,000. The criticism f
"profit hunting" might be, and is, a
danger among thÂ« associations t
"workmen producers." The ten<!
there might be to cut their own wage*
and scale down necessary expense
order to better fight the outside com
petition. The unions have to watch
these organizations closely, lest they
establish a wage scale below the stand
ard of life, but in the co-operative con
sumers' associations, which are bound
first by the unions, and second in
own natural cajiacity as working
not only ia this tendency absent but a
sympathetic treatment of all
reform is the rule. While the vigilâ^y
of the co-operatives' upper fflcials iÂ»
not uncertain, the direct Incentive to
strict supervision is. of eours*. absent,
and. to replace it, the societies have en
deavored to build up an esprit de corps,
a voluntary personal Integrity,, fey open
treatment. And the success of this ->n-^|

â¢7 B came shufP.:n- \jp the slight
Â«_J slope to â  cluster of towering
oil derricks. He was distress-
ingly thin, and tall, and lanky.
His frail frame swayed with the
â¢wind; hi* thighs and legs were as fiat
as the flapping ixta of a jumping
jack; while from between his should
ers rose a lons, thin neck that seemed
too slender to support' the head. To
crown all. his hair was a thatch of red
bristles that could neither be brushed
up nor down.
His best friends were the oil derricks,
for here he could compel respect and
admiration by his feats upon the scaf
folding. A kind of mysterious har
mony had sprung up between the lad
and the derricks. From the time he
was a small boy he had crawled over
them, swinging from side to side by the
ropes, or even from one derrick to
another, as none of his companions
had been able to do. But he could not
run. and he could not jump. He had
none of the keenness for sports that
the others had.
One silent derrick rose in the very
center of the cluster of oil-stained
towers. The drilling tools had been re
moved and the boiler and dirty engine
lay rusty and forgotten in the mad
rush to more prosperous wells. From
the apex of the abandoned well hung
a wheel-pulley from which an old rope
dangled to the ground.
'.This derrick and Henry had become
close friends. It was his haven when
he â wished to be alone; when he wished
to forget everything. He had pulled
up a few short boards and builded him
a little platform near the top. Inacces
sible 6ave by the ladder of the old
rope. Whenever he could steal away
from the thoughtless playmates he was
accustomed to climb hand over hand
to this platform; he alone of all the
boys could climb the rope to the top.
Perched high on the derrick Carrots
forgot the unkindness of his playmates
as he whiskered his secret to the non
committal derrickâ his secretâ his and
one other's, "the master's," as he call
ed !
How vividly the scene rose before
him; tht day he had surreptitiously
fl^d from a hard task set before him by
his father, with his pencil and pad of
P: scratch paper. He was writing a
â y â one of â  dozen he had already
ited and â destroyed again. A story!
That was his secret; his ambition. He
knew that he was uneducated and that
h,iÂ£ attempts were but sorry frames of
the structures he was determined to
'build.
"I wi!'.." he cried aloud; "I will!"
"You will what?"
He had turned and faced the master.
"I will become an author," he had
replied. Then the master had talked to
him for an hour. He had not even
laughed at Carrots' attemptâ but had
advised him to finish high school and
college â read.
That was long ago. yet Carrots was
steadfast in his determination. He had
read; he had written; perhaps also he
had worked less carelessly at his rou
tine tasks because of the hope in his
heart.
"Carrots! Write me a 'dictionary!"
He looked down and saw that the
boys had gathered about the old tower,
CErrots only grinned at the thought
less laughter and swallowedâ unseen â
his pain. He was high on his friendly
derrick where none could reach him or
follow. His heart beat fiercely in ex
ultation as he looked down upon the
handsome well-formed boys beneath
him. What did it matter if they were
stronger than he or swifter of foot?
They could not climb his rope, and they
could not understand his ambition.
Nevertheless he felt it keenly.
As Carrots sat there upon his derrick
a eudden roar told the boys that a
"pusher" had been struck. Four hun
dred yards away a great burst of ink
like crude oil shot to the top of the
tower and showed black against the
cloudless sky. The boys watched the
I men control the spouting oil and divert
' f .t in*c its reservoir in a hollow be
tween the hills, where an earthen dam
prevented -its escape down the ravine.
This reservoir had become nearly full
of escaping oil before the men could
cap the well, and the boys, eager for
new fields of amusements, went scram
bling: down to the lower embankment.

i Awkward, ungainly, blundering,
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
sensitive Carrots, whose heart never
ceased to ache with longing, paused
on the top of a swell on the slope and
glanced back at the active oil camp
against the foothills. Very faintly the
familiar chug, chug of the engines
reached him, along with the faint,
hoarse cries of busy men. They had
already forgotten him. What mattered
his coming or going?
For a moment he stood there, and
then with a shrug he brushed aside the
feeling and walKed to the house. He
took his pencil and pad and started up
the foothills for th^ pinon slopes, in
tending to be gone an hour or two.
He found that some one had invaded
his retreat. A small fire, left to
smolder â¢ unattended, lay sputtering
among a few pinon branches.
The whole foothill region was clothed
with a dense mass of grease-wood
brush, with the exception of the open
spots on the ridges, which were lightly
studded with pinon trees. From the
edge of the grease-wood the hills fell
away in big fields of dry grass and
brush, down to the oil camp.
"That's careless," he muttered, bend
ing to extinguish the little fire.
Then he saw beyond the coals a nar
row belt of black charred grass and
pinon needles. His heart stood still as
he glanced along this burnt strip and
saw a faint line of smoke rising from
the edge of the brush. The cabin lay
just over the top of that brush, and
beyond the cabin
"The oil! The oil!" he cried.
Reaching the house he seized a shovel
and short ax. he stood a moment ir
resolute. To run to the camp and warn
the men were a great loss of time. To
climb the side of the gully and fight
the fire on the ridge meantâ perhapsâ
the savins of the house and the great
cil tanks.
Only a moment he hesitated, then he
turned and rushed to the top of the
ridge.
The fire was rapidly gaining mi>
mentum under the swelling wind of its
own creation. It had branched out like
a fan, and was half way up the op
posite slope, with a burning front a
hundred yards wide.
Glancing hastily about him Carrots
chose the top of the sloping ridge for
his line of battle. Sticking the short
ax into his belt he started with his
shovel to scoop a swath through the
dry grass up the ridge to the edge of
the brush.
With the rhythmic stroke of a pen
dulum. Carrots swung the shovel like a
scythe in front of him, each time scoop
ing up grass and soil and banking it on
the farther side of the swath. Up, up,
he worked, almost as fast as he could
walk. The swath grew Into a dirt path
four feet wide with a light dirt em
bankment on its edge.
The brush was soon reached and the
shovel gave way to the ax. Here the
short-handled brush cutter came into
good use. Carrots, upon his knees,
pressed the brittle brush aside and with
a single blow from the ax cut it off.
From right to left and always up, the
swale was cut. and the loose brush
thrown to the left, out of reach of the
fire.
The smoke, borne down before the
rapidly growing wind, persisted In
creeping along the ground under the
brush. It burned his eyes and hurÂ»
his lungs. The heat of the fire, too,
added to the hot rays of the sun.
scorched and blistered his skin.
With his long red hair hanging wet
over his face. Carrots chopped his way
through the first patch of greasewood
to the open pinon flat. Here he. resort
ed to the shovel again, keeping: his fire
break away from the trees and needles.
He worked his way swiftly across the
flat, and started upon the swale
through the brush higher up.
The fire had now nearly reached the
lop. There must be no faltering, no
resting.
The heavy banks of smoke crowded
in upon him until he had to throw
himself face down to fill his lungs with
air. But always he would rise to his
knees again, and continue swinging thÂ«
ax. He wondered why the men did not
come, why he alone was there to fight
the fire. He wondered if he could con
quer, if he could save his father's
house and oil. But with all of his
thoughts he continued to chop the
brush away from the swale.
Carrota gained a short respite as the
lire won the top, for mountain flrea.
although they burn rapidly up the hill,
burn more slowly on the ridges. Down
hill they eat their way with the pace
of a snail.
If he could only gain on It and force
it to burn away from the oil! He set to
work with renewed eagerness, cutting
his swinging curved swale along the
slope.
He was working in the fire now.
What did it matter if his hands and
face did smart; if his shoes were shriv
eling and burning his feet; if he could
not breathe or see, if he could only out
off the fire on the favorable downward
slope?
Working along the edge of the fire in
whirling heat and flame; standing in
smoke and hot ashes â Carrots beat out
the burning grasa with his shovel or
chopped a new cut-off around some
slowly burning brush heap.
Slowly he gained at first; then as the
fire began to lag on the downward
slope he forged ahead and gained
the top of the canyon. And then at
last he knew that the nre was cut off
from the lower oaOÃhrj; It is true that
it had a vast expanse of brushy moun
tain ahead of it, but that was beyond
his control. At leaat it was headed
away from the house and the oil camp.
Carrots stopped for a bare moment to
breathe. How his parched tongue and
throat thirsted for water and his whole
body for rest. But he could not rest
now. There was still work to do.
He watched the flames In a wall
twenty feet high rush on up the moun
tain, then he turned and walked down
its swale, cutting it a little wider here
md there, or scraping away the burn
ing twigs from the path.
And then there only remained a big.
black, smoking mountain slope, with
little patches of brush burning Idly in
the yellow sunlight.
Half way down the ridge Carrots met
the oil men stamping out the last
smoldering embers. The wide clean
swale had excited their wonder and
admiration. Little did they imagine
who the worker was, until they saw
the black, scorched, hatless Carrota
stumbling through the ashes and
burnt brush.
"I guess my boy is all right," Mr.
Patton said a little later, with his hand
on Carrot 3" shoulder.
There was something in the tone and
touc v that had not been there before
a new note, a new tenderness. Car
rots suddenly found himself embar
rassed beyond words. Something
beautiful had suddenly come Into h!a
life. He tried to break away, bdt this
time he could not escape unnoticed.
"It is all right, my boy. I under
stand.'*
"Oh." exclaimed Carrots, In confu
sion, "I wanted to tell you I didn't
forget the alfalfa. I worked hard and
finished It first."
Mr. Patton remembered his words
of a few hours before with & sudden
pang. He it was who now became em
barrassed.
"It's all right, my boy," he said. "I
shall not misunderstand you again."
Then he added: "And you shall have
your schooling! You have fairly earn
ed it by this one day's work."
That was all; but years later, after
he had gone through college ami was
deep in hla stories. Carrots looked back
with gratefulness at this mountain fire
that had gained for him his father's
confidence and understanding.

One, could see at a glance* that the
transport captain hated the sight of the
mate, having, no doubt, the usual Brit
ish navy; suspicion and dislike of any
thing; that acted independently., and of
Its own volition. The captain was. for
ever: growling, and faultfinding,- and I
often wondered Just what effect It had
upon; the mate, for his face was an Im

tion. But I had gotten past the age
when sentiment counted for much, and
I was sick and tired of taking orders
from every one in sight, anyway; so I
simply demanded that my contract be
annulled, and In due time was suc
cessful. ,
McKlm came In to sec me almost
every day. Most of his time was spent
along the Paslg and paddling around
inside the breakwater looking for a
suitable vessel at a reasonable price.
Until my contract was annulled I wan
occupied with my duties In the First
Reserve Hospital, where X had been
temporarily assigned. One day I met
him on the Escolta talking to a Span
ish mestizo who seemed greatly ex
cited.
"Good morning, doctor," he remarked
In Spanish. "Senor Valdem," turning
to the mestizo, "permit me to introduce
my partner, Dr. Boles. Senor ValdeÂ«,"
he continued to me, "owns a vessel that
I think might answer our. purpose were
it not for the Bad fact that some of
her frames .' and part of .', her . keel are

' The following day McKim shipped a
native ? crew, three Tagals and two
Visayans,. Hollo men, who afterward
turned out â 'â  to ,be brave, devoted serv

ropean honesty to bring, a valuable
cargo t across t the ;; China - sea, â  and ' was

In his Oriental code of ethics there
could be no dishonesty, where there was
no risk of punishment. : . I looked at Mc-
Kirn. His face was as '.expressionless
us the Chinaman's. Then I turned to
the latter. HHoHttV9Â«lp4

The Chinaman smiled Joyously and
emitted a few happy little chuckles.
"I cannot go myself," ho mild: "It In
necessary to trust some one, nnd I
have found. that white men of the bet
ter class are honest. Besides, there will
be more cargoes to carry."
The following day we went over to
Manila and saw our patron. He ex
plained In detail what was required of
us, at the same time giving suggestions
as to the easiest way of accomplishing
the undertaking. It was easy to Bee
that the thing had been done before,
and not to his satisfaction. We were
to clear In ballast for the open ports of
the southern Islands, ostensibly after a
general cargo of rice, tobacco, coffee,
hemp, sugar, etc., and, once clear of the
land, were to make all haste across the
China Sea, run Into the estuary of the
Hal Chin River and drop anchor. Then
we were to charter a boatman to take
a letter about twenty miles up the
river to a place called Wai Pu, lying
In the foothills of the Tan Chin
: Mountains. The following night a small
junk would come alongside from which
.we would transfer our cargo. On our
way back we were to call at Cebu,
where a general cargo would be quick
ly put aboard. Then we were to break
out the hemp and bale it up around
â¢ the opium and silk. If there were any
Questions about the time it took us to
'go from Manila to Cetm we were to
answer that â¢we ' had got aground and
sprung a leak, so that it was necessary
to 'beach her for repairs. This story
the appearance of our craft would
amply justify.
Our patron promised us that â  there
would be no risk to us, as he would
give us an order duly made out to car
ry his " cargo, â  of which, of course, we
would ". not ; be ~ expected to know any
more than its general appearance seem
ed to justify, from Cebu to Manila. Once
*> anchored in â ' Manila Bay . the whole '
-'work of : discharging : would be taken '
; , by him, and ; all it â  would be necessary
for us to do would, be to show him
the manifest signed by his Chinese
partner and receive our pay. The
whole trip ; should " not take over six
.'â¢â ' weeks. 'â¢>.'/:::'S'-'ii\^ i ''y. ij:VV);v-.>^ â¢â¢â¢"V- >â â¢â¢â â¢'"â â¢
: ,-â  Three' days later we sailed. Much to
my surprise the Purissima' proved to be ;
' a fairly ' good Â» traveler, : and it was : truly
: a , marvel . the ' way ' the old coffin â¢ would :
[ â  get ; to " windward. ~s' McKim s had I made ' a :
. ; few ', ; alterations uln 'r her rig â¢>; and ' had
J given her ;a ; tremendous â¢ fore , and aft ;
mainsail, which made her something .
; between a brigantine and a . hermaph
â '-â  rodite brig.', It had : a queer look, but it
. helped her wonderfully : in ; getting up
Into the wind. Our ; crew turned out
very well. V They all : bunked forward, ;.
/of ' course, and seemed :to ' get on ' peace
i fully enough. v McKim ;â ; had " the : star- -,
board watch with the .two Tagals, and
-I. the port with the Visayans. The old
; man cooked. ';'<â â / "f â.â .'.â¢' V :, - '
An incident had occurred on our way

.came on deck .to " relieve â¢mci at â¢â  eight >
bells, and before iI 5 went j below Ato : : get

off his clothes for a bath. I was watch
ing. him casually, for his; quick, v lithe ':;
j motions \ always â  had i a fascination â¢ for
v me, and -: I noticed 'â  around i his ',' neck a
1 sort of i rosary, which, when 'I : observed
I more closely, seemed to be a diminutive

I saries that have frequently been | found I

: "Why do you wear that thing, Mr

but went below. : -^.': J *- :.â /'â ' â ' /â ^â â ' .
V The little bay where we dropped ; an
chor was a fine harbor, landlocked on
all 5 sides by, high, bold, rounded J hills,
naked ' of vegetation and studded ' with .
great ' black r granite boulders; ; a ; wild,
: desolate place and uninhabited except ,
for a few fishermen's huts on the shore.
We got a hold of i a couple iof i coolies f;
: who came Â out In Â : a sailing ' sampan,
'â â  and i after i much \ haranguing, f or .', their â¢
â¢ dialect was different from any that :I â  â 
; had v encountered -in my missionary
, work, ; made them understand 'â  that I we :',
wanted, and | that there would -. be i twice
the amount of money paid them when
they returned. Our patron's agent' was
to send us back a scrap of paper bear
ing a character/ of which \ we : held the V
duplicate to indicate that our mes
sage had been' received.
The following day the "messengers re- x
turned, ho I got everything in readiness
.to receive our â¢ cargo". The ' silk ; was '; to
go down 'in the fore peak under some
extra sails and the opium under a falsa
flooring beneath our cabin. I had seen
â¢ enough of . Chinese 4 character not . to
trust it too far. so I got out my Colt's
revolver and carefully oiled and load
it, getting McKim ,to do the same.
Then ' I * armed . the ' sailors ' with : heavy '
knives that I had secured before leav
ing Manila, and cautioned them against
turning their backs on the crew of
'.. the dhow Â». , â  ,' ' 'â  â ,''>' â "'..
The " night cam* ; down dark and
murky, and blotted out the shore line
except where here and there the shoul
der of i some great overhanging hill
loomed blackly, against the somber sky.
The water was dead and dismal. Not
a r ripple nor : a flicker ' of phosphores
cence came from the sea. though now
and then I felt the puff of a chilly land
breeze, smelling of moist earth and rot
ting seaweed. I was leaning on the rail
trying to cheer myself with a reflective
pipe, for my spirits were very low/ and
thinking of th* altered conditions be
tween my first and second trips to
"XUfi" sort â¢* mA^m
"pat, pat" of naked feet an the coolies 1
Sulxo. weio sculima tfie craÂ£l. threw th* -*
.weight first on onÂ« foot and then on tTiB other.
Our crew wero gathered together forward In ft
little black huddled knot, and presently one of
them crawled Htealthily aft. â 
"Whnt Is it?" I naked In a whisper.
The man pointed his skinny arm Into the
darkness. Following the direction there sud
denly resolved Itself from the gloom a great
squares opacity that Blood out against the denser
darkness behind. It puzzled me at first and
then I made it out to bo tin- big black sail of
the dhow, which had been hoisted to catch the
fitful puffs of the night breeze.
Our anchor light was burning a dead yellow.
I went below, and; lighting a powerful lantern
we had got for the purpose,, hoisted it on a hal
liard that I had reeved through a little block
lashed to the spring stay the day before. The
light flared suddenly on the big sail of the dhow,
that was now close aboard. A putter of muf
fled orders In a guttural voice came from her
decks:
"Hello" said I. "Stand by for a line."
"E-ee â yah â aa â " came a -voice In answer.
I sent a heaving line uncoiling snakily
through the darkness. It fell athwart her decks
and in a moment we had her moored bow and
stern. McKlra dropped our sea ladder and Im
mediately the crew of the dhow came swarming
up. I couldn't see any use for more than the
captain, so I shoved the rest of the mob back
and hauled up the ladder. A light whip had
been rigged from the main topsail yardarm, and
I ordered our crew to man it, and in a moment
the bales and boxes came swinging over the side.
No attempt was made to examine them, as we
were simply to receive what was sent and. re
ceipt for the total number of pieces.
The Chinaman who had come aboard carried
a piece of paper in his hand, which he signified
that he wanted signed. McKim carried it be
low. " The Chinaman stood beside the hatch
waiting for him to come up. I was busy tallying
in the bales, the last of which was just coming
aboard,' but something, I don't know Just what,
impelled me to watch that Chinaman out of the ;
.tail;' of 'my eye. And as I watched the bales with
one eye and the man with the other I saw his
hand suddenly slide down to his belt and caught
. the flash of the cargo light on naked steel.
â  "Look out, McKim!" I shouted.
A wild, eerie scream came in answer and a
wave of 1 dark, agile figures came pouring sud
denly over the bow and stern. My gun j was out
in a Hash, and I cut.down on the man -at' the
head of ' the â  companlonwny, "who, with another.
scream even wilder than the first, lurched r head- :
long i into ,the ' scuppers. Â§ The I next moment Me
, Kirn was oorn r deck, and; together we leaped on
the deckhouse. â¢ ' â¢ ; -,

â â¢" out ; the heavy ' teak s tiller which was * shoved un
der the after thwart. It was well I did so, for
our â¢ revolvers were V quickly emptied ',-,â  into 1 the ,
faces of the mob, and the next moment we were

against \ overpowering â  odds. .-.'; - ,: â¢

into â  a man's ; ace, ' and, Â» gripping > the tiller with -
both hands, was getting in blow after blow as
opportunity offered, parrying S occasional thrusts ;
as best I could. For what seemed a long time
we beat them back ' as I fast as - they â¢ leaped at i us,
; then suddenly something ; heavy : struck ; me fn' the
chest and over I went with a crash, and the next;

my shoulder blades would go, and turn after
turn of thin bark twine was whipped around
and cut deep Into my wrists.
Although repeatedly struck and cuffed I did
not lose consciousness, ana the most distinct im
pression retained is that of McKim, the clothes
torn away from the upper part of his body, a
great gaping gash over his eye from which the
blood spattered over his demoniacal face, which
was working grotesquely in the dim, nickering
light from the cargo lantern, and even at the
time I was struck by the weird similarity of his
face to those about him.
So quick were his actions that they seemed
unable to reach him with any weapon; then
suddenly some great object flew up from the
crowd. There was the scrunching noice of iron
on bone and the next moment he was gone.
PART IL
The flght was over and almost immediately
I heard the windlass in the bow going around
and the chain hawser coming in. Vehement or
ders were frenzledly chattered In a fierce and
constant flow of monosyllables, and from what
I was able to understand I gathered that a part
of the gang were to take the brig immediately
to sea.
In the general confusion I appeared to have
been overlooked and lay bound and helpless
where I had been dropped. Suddenly a shout
came from forward, the clank of the hawser
teased and the foretopsail began to flap lazily.
A louder order was shouted from the poop, and
the crowd about the deck broke up, half of them
hurrying to the side. Three men who were at the
the main halliards belayed them where they
were, and slipping to where I lay grabbed mo
roughly and started to drag me to the side. I
supposed, of course, that I was going overboard,
and had In fact become quite reconciled to the
Idea, and was trying to get a cold consolation
from the sight of the prostrate bodies that lay
about the deckhouse, but as I saw how many
they were I began to fear that possibly there
might be something: warmer in store
for me than the black waters of the
bay.
I was hauled over the gunwale and
dropped heavily into the bottom of
the dhow, and a few seconds later Mr-
Kirn was laid alongside of me. He
was unconscious and breathing aterto
roualy, and I got my shoulder under
his head and hauled a loose piece of
matting up over him with my teeth,
for the night was coU! ;n<i his shirt
had been torn to pieces.
A few final orders were shouted
from the deck of the brig, which was
already under way, and we cast oft
and headed up the river. I was begin
ning to feel dizzy and light-headed, for
although I did not notice it at the time
I had lost a good deal of blood from
a long shallow slash where some beg
gar had wiped a knife across the front
of my chest; perhaps I simply slept,
but at any rate I have no recollection
of the firs* part of the trip. When I
finally awoke, or came to myself, the
dawn had broken and I saw by the
gray, early light that we were working
up a winding stream which flowed
sluggishly between irregular moun
tains of no great height which I judged
to be the Yongn'ans â foothills of the
Bohea Range that runs northeasterly
frum the north of Kwang Tung. We
had probably been sculling by relays
all night, but toward sunrise the
breese blew In from the sea, so the big
square sail was hoisted luid we made
good sailing time.
The behavior of our captors when
they saw that I was awake and in
clined to take an Interest in things,
rather surprised me. At first I was so
stiff and sore that I could hardly
move; my shoulders felt as if they
were being racked, but my arm.
hands were entirely devoid of all sen
sation. By squirming: urouud a bit I
managed to get In a sitting position.
There was a Chinaman on either side
of me, one smoking and the other busy
with a wooden bowl of rice and chop
ped greens. Although I knork>-d
against them In my effort to rise they
did not pay me the slightest attention,
but a man who seemed to be a person
of authority caught sight of me a few
moments latar and said something to
one of the men beside me, who drew
his knife and cut the lashing arouml
my wrists. I could, no doubt, have
made myself understood, and was
rather tempted to ask some question*,
but decided to conceal what knowledge
I had of their language in the hope uf
learning something of what was to
happen. A little later, however, a
bowl of rice was handed me.
McKim was still unconscious, but
his pulse was fairly â  good and hla
breathing: quiet and even. I did not
feel much concern about him, as I had
a sort of a notion that he might be
in a better , state than I was. Never
theless : 1 v . tore a piece from my shirt
and dipping 1 it over ' the side, washed
the blood away from hiÂ» wounds and
bound them up. No one seemed to
take the slightest Interest In the pro
ceeding, and it even seemed to me that
such glances as were thrown casually
our way. were strangely free from
malice. Indeed, 1 knew enough of
Chinese character to appreciate that
in their utter selfishness such as had
survived the fight of the night before
were possibly gratified on the whole
that .we had lessened the number
among whom the profits of the expedi
tion were to be divided.
As we worked up the river It kept
growing narrower and narrower, and

Ms we proceeded, though some of the
vfilloys seemed to bo somewhat culti

A*bout sundown We sighted a village
nhead, at the base of a big dome
shaped mountain, and, as wo drew
nfinr, I Haw that wo were to Btop there
I was glad of. It, for the suspense nn<l
I>r in of my wound was beginning to be
unbearable. McKlm was regaining
consciousness, but seemfed to be get
ting 1 feverish, and occasionally mut
tered incoherently. As we drew up to
I bamboo Jetty that was built out Into
tho stream, I noticed a very old man
who was In the little crowd that had
come down to meet us. He was ap
parently of a very great age, although
strong and active, and In spite of his
round, stooping shoulders,- and the
deep wrinkles that seamed his face
there was something about him that
Again suggested that bizarre resem
blance to McKlm.
We were carried ashore and laid on
thf ground near a .hut, the crowd
watching us apathetically, but the old
man. i have mentioned drew near and
appeared to ask some questions of our
captain. The next moment he became
' perfectly . convulsed, and when he
straightened out again I saw that hia
face was simply demoniacal with rage.
He came hobbling over to us with such
an uncanny agility and a look of; such
concentrated hatred and malice upon
his ace, that I decided that at last we
had swung to the end of our scope. .
McKlm was the nearest to him, and
was I lying, on his ' back, hla face flushed
and muttering .to himself with lips
parched from fever. 1 As the old, mac
approached him I saw â  an expression
of the most utter astonishment 'pass
over his face, and. following his gaze
saw that his eyes * were V fixed Con ? the
rcsary or amulet that hung; about the
neck of my., 1 shipmate. The next mo
ment he had it in his hand- was break
. Ing into !â¢ exclamations; of wonder and
awe. 1 He ! kept' glancing from the ros
ary to : McKlm's face, ? and suddenly ;he
darted to I him;; took ( his head between
his hands, , and said a few quick, harsh
' words. -t McKim stared; at him stupidly
for a moment, then answered:
"Annan."
. I did not know it at the time, but
'_ have . since discovered, that >- the ; word
for "mother" of the Tuscaroras and
Six Nations is' "Annah," which is ; the
same; as ; the \ Tartar word. : : But "> the
, effect on the old man ; was magicaL

the continent Of North America they
would naturally turn their faces south

and fertile country before them. The
more I thought of the matter the more
I became satisfied with my theory, and
finally, having reached a standstill, I
fell asleep.
The murmur of voices awakened me,
and, turning over, I saw that the room
was full of men who were arguing ex
citedly and occasionally casting acowl
ing looks at McKlm, who was Sleeping
heavily. But our old friend of the
evening before was the most excited
of the lot, and apparently the most
authoritative, for finally the tumult
ceased, and the rabble poured out. I
tried to get ups but he shook his head
and motioned for me to remain where
I was. One of the women brought mo
some food, a stew of chicken and rice
and a few slices of raw fish. _
With the old man's permission, I
moved my mat to the doorway of the
hut and amused myself watching the
fishermen along the river bank. Evi
dently our Jailer was well disposed, for
he spoke to one of the women, -who
steeped me a bowl of tea and furnished
me with a pipe and tobacco. I tried
to talk with him, as I was somewhat
familiar, with the dialects of the coast,
but, although he made every effort to
understand me, he was '.unsuccessful.
After It ; had grown dark he went
out, but in a few moments returned
with a heavily padded tunic I was not
at all. chilly, but he motioned for me to
put it on. A few minutes later two
coolies came in, and lifting . .McKim,
mat ; and ; all, carried him > outside the
door, where there was a â¢ little knot vi
men waiting â coolie carriers I. made
them out . to . be. McKim was i laid in a
hammock , swung from a bamboo, and '
our* host, or I jailer, motioned for me to
get into another like It, and In a few
moments we were all in motion. > \ ;
; Although ,It was â¦â¢ very dark, I ; could .
see I that we were climbing into a very ;

night the 1 trip began again, this* time
with new coolies. On the fourth morn

began \ to ; change S for : the 5 better, V. and,
after sleeping all day quite naturally,
he suddenly awoke to consciousness."; I
did "i not want J to ? excite k < him any more
than was necessary,, so in answer to his
question simply said that we ; were pris
oners, but were -being well treated and:
just now were moving into the' interior,
probably to j make escape more difficult.
That seemed " to â¢ satisfy t him, and af tÂ«r
eating , a light â¢ meal he went ; to ! sleep." Â»;.*./
â ^ That night we traveled again, and as
the â  first i" light V began to * break Hin S the ;

stood on the hearth and remarked to his wife, who
sat in a rocking chair, half dreamily knitting: "They
must hire folks by the year to do nothin' else but
v rite about women."
"They want to furnish the men somethin' to read,"
his wife replied.
"Furnish the men scunethin' to skip so as to read
somethin' else," said the old man. "Once in a while I
read 'em. though, and I've just read a lot of stuff that I
know want written by anybody, man or woman, that had
anything else to do â a whole column and a half tellin'
how to raise children; and I'll bet a steer it was written
by an old maid."
"Limuel. what are you talkin' about?"
"An old maid, I said; and one of the sort that
snatches up her skirts and runs like a turkey hen when
ever she sees a child comin' toward her. Oh, I know
their brand."
"Yes, I suppose so," said his wife. "But a woman
that's raisin' children hasn't got time to write and one
that has them already raised is so tired she don't feel
like it."
"Oh I expected to get it, one way or another,"

going." I suggested. "Keep him guessing, .as you Yan
kees say."
McKim turned to Khanghisen and spoke. It seemed
to me that Khan was rather apologetic in his manner.
"He says to my own people," said McKim. "I don't
know what he means by that."
"Ask him if your people came down here six hun
dred years ago from the northward beyond the Great
Wall," I ventured.
McKim repeated the question. It was easy to see
that my straight shot had gone home.
"He wants to know why you ask that question," said
McKim. "He says that it is not well that one not of
our people should know so much. But he says we must
be going on."
Night had fallen when we reached the outskirts of
the village, but evidently something unusual was going
on, for the streets were crowded with people, and as we
passed the temple we heard the muffled "boom-boom"
of the great drum, and the noiseless tread of the priests
round and round. No one impeded us in any way, but
there were many curious glances as our hammocks
passed, and more and more was I struck by the simi
larity of these people to my shipmate.
The arrangement of the houses was different from
anything I ever saw before in China. They were built
of bamboo and wicker work closely thatched and of a
peculiar conical shape, wjth a bulge about six feet from
the ground; a Tartar style of architecture, as I after
ward discovered.
We entered one of the best, which had evidently
been arranged Tor our reception. Inside there were a
couple of large comfortable couches, the sides of which
were of a peculiar scroll-shaped design, and in on^ cor
ner there v.as a jlittle recess in which stood â or rather
squatted â a brass image of Buddha about eighteen
inches in height, in front of which were arranged in a
semicircle nine brazen vases, of wineglass shape.
About 8 o'clock the following morning the Khan
appeared and took McKim away with him. When they
came back, about two hours later, I could see that Mc-
Kirn was tremendously excited. His hands were work
ing spasmodically, his nostrils distended, and from time
to time I caught the red glare from his pupils, which
I learned to associate with unusual excitement. He
turned on me abruptly.
"Doctor," he said, "do you know what these people
tell me?"
"I can form an idea," said I. "They claim that you
are a descendant of their own race, and, more than that,
a descendant of their own regal line."
He looked at me in amaKment "How did you ever
discover that?" he demanded.
"Simply because I have thought so for some time."
"â¢Well," he said, "I give it up. Surprises are coming
too fast. But do you know what they want me to do?"
"Rule them?"
"Not quite that, but to remain with them as a sort
of Prince to be instructed by their wise men, and per

JOTTINGS OF OLD LIM
JUCKLIN ON WOMEN
REFORMERS
replied the old man. "It was due
and I deserved it. But it does
seem that the writers on the subject
of women ought to stumble on some
thin' new. But man has been studyin'
women â now, let me see. Well, par
ticularly ever since Samson's wife
cut his hair off, and he hasn't stum
bled on anything new yet. I've given
her a good deal of my time and I'm
ready to make my acknowledgments.
I've summed up my account book.
Two and two make four anywhere
else. But with women two and two
sometimes make six. You can't tell.
Figgers don't lie, but with her they are
mighty accommodatin'. And, Lord
bless her, she has finally discovered
that man is her enemy. The old
maids have told her so and she has
begun to believe it. Over here across
the creek the other day a party of
haps later to lead the tribe northward.
It seems that their own country is to
the north, and they have a tradition
that a man of their royal blood will
come from across a big water and
will lead them home."
"A very : hackneyed popular tribal
prophecy," I remarked. "And what
are you goiiig to do?"
"Oh, I don't know. I've got to think
it out. It doesn't make much differ
ence, as they wouldn't let us go just
now, any way."
"What does the Khan rank in the
outfit?"
"He is the younger brother of the
present chief. He went down to the
ccast with a good bulk of the opium
for the partner of our friend in Ma
nila. It seems we had the misfortune
to kill one of his servants who went
out with the stuff; rather a favorite
with the old man."
"And whose plan was It to scrag
us?"
"Oh, that scheme was cooked up by
our friend's partner, Avho wants to
start a little piracy business of his own

and needed a vessel." â ,- ' -*
"He got it, and something to boot,"

Ksm, ; and they went out together. T -,
*******
* ; And then began a o process which I
OPIE READ
'em had a meetln' and resolved that
man was a tyrant and ought to be
ousted. Old Miss Patsy Page that has
chased every chance to git married
that she could find through a spy
glass a-comln' her way was the pres
ident. She called attention to the
number of divorces throughout the
country and she sighed over all this
waste of raw material. She read a
paper, too, on how to manage a hus
band. Bet she'd like to read a book
on how to catch one."
"Limuel, she's a good woman. She
sets up with the sick."
"Yes, and when she does the well
folks catch it. She'd sour a morn
in's milkin' by lookin' the cow in the
eye."
"Well," replied the old lady, "she
says that you used to come to see her,
hope to God I may never live to see
again â the reversion of a man from
the civilized to the barbarian. Day by
day I could see the insidious process
working. , Through the wiles of that
cunning schemer, Khan-ghisen, Mc-
Kirn sank slowly backward through
six centuries in a little more than six
and she has hinted that she could
have had you."
"Ha, if I'd married her she would
have had me â you can bet a settin* of
eggs on that."
"It waa the talk of the neighbor
hood how you used to go to dances
with her."
"Yes, it was the talk of the neigh
borhood when anybody went with her
at all. Gad, she had a tongue that
would aick out a briar. And now she
is a reformer, an uplifter of down
trodden women. Well, she spent
about two-thirds of her life tryin' to
tread 'em down. I can recollect when
every girl in the neighborhood was
afraid of her. An old gypsy came
along one time and had some love
powders for sale, and Miss Patsy she
bought some and managed to give
'em to Zeb Collins. She must have
given him about half a pound from
the way he acted. Went out and
hung over the back fence and called
hogs for ten minutes, he did. After
a while when he was silent she looked
out after him and he was a ketchin'
of his horse. We called him Bakin'
Powder Zeb after that. But he
didn't rise."
"I don't believe she gave him the
powders."
"No, just loaned 'em to him. At
any rate, he got 'em. And now you
trace back some of the biggest of
these women reformers and you'll
find love powders in their lives, some
where. There ain't nothin' on the
earth brighter than a bright woman â â 
and there's nobody that the Lord
ought to shower his favors down on
more than her. No matter how good
a man is he can't begin to ketch up
with her. She is tenderness, love,
truth, religion â all in one. But when
she's pizenous â look out. That is the
time for Satan himself to dodge. And
I'll bet every time he sees old Miss
Patsy comin' he takes to his flinty
heels. When a man's disappointed
with life he generally tries to keep it
to himself. But with a woman â she
not only wants it to be known, but
wants to make others dissatisfied."
"Yes," said Mrs. Jucklln, "for when
a man's a failure it is his own fault.
A woman could never have helped her
self."
"You've got me again and I'll have
to get out the best way I can. Yes.
the cause of failure lies with the one
that has failed. It was a lack of en
ergy, a lack of judgmentâ a lack of
somethin'. A man must make circum
stances, but sometimes circumstances
won't be made. Under the law all men
may be born free, but they ain't born
equal. Neither minds nor constitu
tions are on a par one with another in
different men. Man acknowledges this
and quietly knocks under, takin' hold
of the next best thing and doin' with
months. At the end of that time I doubt if there was a
fiercer, keener, more bloodthirsty pagan in the whole clan
than he. I witnessed the process passively, for I had al
ways felt more interest than affection for my partner.
At first the old Khan watched me with jealous suspi
cion, but seeing that I was indifferent, his vigilance re
laxed and we became, in a way, good friends.
McKim was allowed to taste both the freedom and
the darker pleasures of an Oriental life. His manner
and disposition began to undergo subtle changes, until
the liking I had once for him turned gradually into
disgust. At last the climax came.
For some time there had been frequent depredation*
among the scarce flocks of the tribe, and though repeat
ed efforts had been made to detect the robbers, all had
been unsuccessful. Finally, one night McKim took a
dozen of the young men from the village and managed
to ambush and capture the thieves, although in the
fight one of his men was knifed and killed. The fol
lowing day, hearing a great hubbub in the market
place, I went over to see what it was all about To my
horror I saw one of the robbers lashed to a stake that
had been firmly planted into the ground, while near by
a man was heating a spearhead In a little mud furnace.
Standing by, apparently directing the proceeding, stood
my shipmate.
"McKim," said I. "what under heaven are you up
to? Are you going to torture that man?"
"Yes," he answered sullenly; "he has killed one of
us."
"But, my God, man, you can't torture him. Remem
ber that you're an American!"
"I am a Mongol," he answered In an even voice; "It
is the custom of our people."
"Well it's not the custom of mine to stand by and
see a man tortured. I laid my hand on the hilt of my
knife. "Kill him if you want to, but if that beggar with
the spear tries to torture him there will bÂ« another
of you gone up."
His eyes narrowed, and he tried to glare me down,
but if his eyes were aflame, my blood was as well, and
I verily believe I would have tackled the whole gang.
But I think the good -English words brought him to
his senses.
"Dr. Boles." he said at length, "it was my fault that
you got into this scrape and I had hoped to be able to
make some sort of amends, but it is time we parted.
I have wanted to keep you with us. because you stood
by me in danger and my people say your skill is great
and honor and respect you. But your ways are not
our ways, and it is better that we part."
â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢
The next day I left for the coast in the care of six
coolies and a sort of lieutenant. It was a ten days' trip
to where I could get transportation to Hongkong, but in
due time I reached that city without accident. There
I' found a friend who was captain of a big, flat, seagoing
freight car about to clear for Delagoa Bay. He wanted
to ship a doctor, as the callow youth that came out
with him had got war lever and scuttled off to the Cape.
I was glad to get the billet, as my funds were getting
low and the East Coast offers many chances.
I have never heard of McKim. and at times it is
hard to realize that, even in that land of incongruities,
there is to-day a native-born American, of mingled
Puritan and Indian blood, who rules us the lawful and
hereditary chief of a thousand wild Asiatics.
It what he can. I'm talkin' about the
sensible man. But the woman â of the
Miss Patsy stripe, she does her best
and then tries to get even by doin'
her worst. She looks for happiness in
the misery of others. In a sorrowful
countenance she finds the reward of
her efforts. She holds man account
able for the fact that she waa born a
female. The dog that barks at the
moon sees somethin', but the woman
that rails against nature sees nothin'
but herself. I know that some of the
women folks would like to shoot at
me for sayin' it, but I do say that the
mother of a child is greater than the
woman that makes a speech five col
umns long and has the whole com
munity talkin' about how smart she
is."
"How about the father of a child?
Isn't he greater than the man that
makes a speech?"
"He may be. About as no account a
man as I ever came across could make
a speech for the clouds, I tell you. But
when he got through he was just a sea
shell that the musical wind had been a
blowin' into. That was all. He never*
had the joy of carin' for a little human
bein'. He was just a feller that folks
called great because he could talk. We
may not have a mission on this earth,
but if we have, it is to obey the lovin*
instincts of nature. The man that
hates and the woman that has no love
in her heart are both the enemies of
nature. You may say that old Miss
Patsy would have loved, if the oppor
tunity had been given to her. She
would have married, that's true
enough; but I don't believe she nor any
of her ilk ever had any real love \n
the heart. I'm not standin' here talk
in' up for man. Bless you. he's hope
less. He's gone all the gaits. But the
best of us have loved and honored our
women. "We haven't called them the
enemies of man simply because nature
set a limit to our minds and â because
fate or whatever you may call it show
ed us our weakness. We've played
some cards and have drunk a good
deal of liquor, but the best of us have
reformed and we hope the Lord has
forgiven us."
"Oh, of course," said the old lady,
"any man is willing enough to ask the
Lord to forgive him when he knows
that it is nearly time for him to die.
During all the time, night after night,
while these dear little ones that he
thought so much of have been growing
up he has been off at elections and
other things; and when he gets old
enough to quit, then he talks about the
mission of nature and all that sort of
stuff. If man doesn't want women to
go around and make speeches, why
doesn't he marry her and take care of
her? If he thinks that marriage is so
beautiful for a woman, why doesn't he
prove that it is beautiful for him.
Summing up my book, as you summon
up yours, why doesn't a man learn
earlier how to behave himself?"
"Well, I reckon you've got me
again," said the old man.
(Copyright, 1905, by Opie Bead.)AUGUSTA PRESCOTT
THERE Is a rumor that the Prin
cess Cecile has postponed her
â¢ marriage until the merry month .
. of May in order that she. may'
have a full supply of spring
shirt .waists. Certainly It is well
known that the dainty little blonde
Princess -Is very fond of the shirt
waist, and it was while purchasing a
supply in London, with her mother,
that she met the Crown Prince. ';-
London tailors have been very busy
the past few months getting their shirt
waist fashions from the United States,
for In London the American shirt waist
holds supremacy. Signs bearing the
legend, "American shirt waists,** are
exhibited, not only among the shop
pine districts of London, but In the
Rue de la Pali, Paris, and even In
i Vienna and Berlin. There is no one
single garment as much worn as the
shirt waist and all Europe and all
America know it.
The most popular waist of . the coming
, summer will be the embroidered linen
waist. One can put it down as a bit
of fashion gospel that the embroidered
linen waist, fine or heavy, will be the
waist of waists for summer., wear.
"White will be the preferred color, but
there is being made a determined ef
fort to popularize the colored waist.
And one does see pale blue and light
pink embroidered linens, and any num
ber of buffs and greens.
Brit It Is the heavy white waist which
Is first favorite. "It looks dressy
â while not being too frail for every
day," said a woman who had Just laid
In a purchase of nearly fifty shirt
waists. "And as for me and my daugh
ters we absolutely live In shirt waists
from Easter until Thanksgiving.
This year the supply la nearly all white
linen.
Layinr aside the glittering generali
ties of the shirt waists here are a few .
pointers which the woman who is mak
ing up her spring wardrobe must
heed:
Shirt waists, to be elegant, must be
hand embroidered.
For hand embroidery the popular ma
terial is mercerized linen. It is glossy
and wears elegantly. Do not use cot
ton for your hand embroidery, but In
vest in a little glossy linen thread for
your best waists.
Let your embroidery be padded.
Roses must be stuffed and so must all
other flowers. Raise them as high as
you can. Stuff the petals of pinks and
the centers of roses and chrysanthe
mums. The flowers that grow upon
the feminine bosom this spring are
large and heavy and elegantly finished.
Great Big Padded Flowers.
The best shirt waists have immense
bunches of flowers upon the front, not
tiny little wandering sprays, but great
bis: added flowers.
Waists that are made according to
Dame Fashion's most pronounced
modes are made neckless. They have
the little Dutch ne^ck, which will per
mit of a stock or a bertha underneath.
But the neck is finished plain and
round. Or the neck can be a French
neck. with a tiny point In front. It is
very smart to finish the neck with a
cording in order that the Oriental
stocks may be worn, with their gay
embroideries and their tiny pointed
â¢ fronts.
And it Is still smarter to finish them
with a stiff neck band with button
holes front and back so that the new
and beautiful hand embroidered linen
collars carried out in Armenian com
binations may be buttoned on.
. The new hand-embroidered linen col
lars show the most gaudy pinks upon
â¢ them, going all the ' way around the
collar, life-size, and finished with a
bright red ribbon under the chin, to
match the pinks. And there are rose
collars finished in the same way.
It was Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt who
ordered a blouse of white linen entirely
embroidered front and back with small
flowers. And Judging from the waist
and from others bought by fashion
leaders of Washington and elsewhere,
the following will be the characteris
tics of the new waists:
There is not a great deal of blouse
effect either front or back.
The blouse backs are going out and
the new waists that blouse in the
back are so arranged that they can
be pulled down snug and tight.
The .sleeves are immense, but they
taper toward the wrist- Those that ,
bag at the wrist, and there are many
such, are also full at the shoulder
line. There is no such thing 1 as a
small shoulder- One sees many of the
little bagging sleeves and full cuffs
this spring, but there Is also the full
shoulder to balance the sleeve.
Shirt waists are tubable. "Waists
that will not tub are no favorites, be
they cotton, linen, batiste, mull, or
gandie or silk.
Wide belts, made *of needlework
end shaped like girdles, are worn.
Immense needlework belts, two fin
gers deep in front and tapering to
ward the back, are adjusted to many
shirt waists.
Waists, all made of piece embroi
dery, are made up and trimmed with
hand embroidery of a contrasting
kind..
To be very swagger make your
waist of piece embroidery and then
work by hand some of the largest
flowers In the pattern, doing them in
brilliant tones and in such a way that
they will stand out.
Don't forget that waists are worn
with stocks, with little yokes attached,
and that some of the handsomest shirt
waists depend upon * these yokes and
collars.
Be sure to recognize the value of a
smart stock and don't try to make
your shirt waists without , from one to ;
three adjustable stocks, choosing va
riety In material and color.
Remember that : the shirt waist is
meant to be worn with a skirt that
matches^ the waist in color and tex
ture. Do not attempt to wear a waist
that does not harmonize in any way.
And don't forget to * preserve your
shoulder lines. Make your : waist ; as
broad as your figure will allow across -
the neck and shoulders.
Have your everyday ' waists heavy
YOUR SUMMER SHIRT WAIST
as you can. It is smart to maice them
heavy and you can trust to the laun
dry and the wear and tear of the sea
son to make them much lighter in
weight
To mention a few more of Dame
Fashion's fashion fads, either very new
with th.c season or done over in very
new ways, one can enumerate these
things:
Fashions of the Season.
English eyelet embroidery done In
white upon white linen.
Handsome lattice work needlework,
done in white upon flowers growing
upon a trellis.
Beautiful raised white roses In white
mercerized line upon a background
of black India linen, costing all kinds
of money.
The most charming thin white linen
dresses, made heavy and substantial
by a very network of hand embroidery,
done in white and 6tuffed and otherwise
stiffened.
White damask linen shirt waists, as
glossy as table linen, and made up in
the plainest of shirt waist fashion.
White damask waists with raised
flowers which look just as though they
grew upon the table cloth rather than
upon a shirt waist.
Yellow damask linen shirt waists that
are to all intents and purposes fash
ioned from one's table linen.
Beautiful unbleached damask waists
which are made up with pipings of
white pique Into the most durable shirt
waists of the season.
And to these waist hints may be add
ed a button hint which suggests that
buttons are beautiful and elaborate,
though not necessarily expensive.
A handsome set of buttons for a shirt
waist was made by covering button
molds with white linen ana then work-
Ing them In mercerized linen. A set
of these buttons costs almost nothing,
yet they are as novel and pretty as
they can be,
A set of linen buttons made by cov
ering button molds with pale blue linen
and working them in forget-me-nots.
These, if done with taate, look almost
like Dresden china buttons. And a
smart shirt waist set was done in
crushed strawberry denim with each
button finished with French knots.
To these may be added a set of beau
tiful buttons covered with many
thicknesses of scrim with a raised
flower, small but pretty, worked on the
top of the button. Such buttons are
washable.
Besides this list of handmade but
tons there may be included in the same
dainty class the entire family of silk
covered and handpalnted buttons
which are now being made for
the summer silks, the foulards, the
wash Bilks and the Oriental silks.
The place which the button takes
this season Is remarkable by Its prom
inence. The. plain little shirt waist
which buttons frankly down the front
Is made all the more beautiful by the
hand embroidered button which takes
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALfc.
the place of tbe bone buttons and Is
infinitely prettier for a change.
A Bride's Shirt Waist.
Here is the description of a shirt
waist which was Just completed for
one of the loveliest brides of the com
ing month:
The waists one sees in the shops
this year, all ready made and waiting
to be bought and put on, are particu
larly alluring. There Is something
about the ready-made waist which is
very attractive. In finish and In fit,
and in all the minor details, it la sure
to be perfect. Even where one Is be
tween sizes, and cannot wear the
ready-made shirt waists or where one
is too large or too small, or too out
of proportion, even in such cases as
these, there are waists that can be
bought to fit or made to fit by very
little alteration.
Indeed, such is the vogue of the
ready-made waists that there is al
most no one who cannot be fitted, and
the woman who is out of size can
eurely find something If she will look
far enough.
"I can buy my waists ready-made
to better advantage than I can make
them myself," declared a woman who
dresses very well Indeed. "And this
is true not only of my everyday waists,
but my evening waists as well.
"I have bought," said she, "an
evening bodice of blue net, low neck
and short sleeves, ready to be put
right on and worn. And the other
day I bought a peacock blue satin
evening waist with high shirred ber
tha and a net drapery all beaded and
beautifully finished. It was one of
tbe prettiest evening dresses I have
ever seen."
The Ready-Made Shirt Waist.
The ready-made waists have cer
tain points to recommend them. The>
are very cheap considering what you
get for your money. They fit beauti
fully. They are of the very newest
and most approved of fashion's mas
terpieces. And they are finished with
a neatness which entitles them to be
called tailor-made. If one can men
tion a greater number of virtues than
these one does well.
The remodeled shirt waist has
many possibilities this season. As a
rule, one wears one's shirt waists but
each season. But it does happen some
times that there are half a dozen
waists in a more or less state pt being
worn out, but all of which can be ad
justed to the wardrobe In some way.
This is what a fashionable seashore
woman is doing to her old waists. An
ancient organdy has been laundered
and is being put into shape to wear
under a fine black hand-embroidered
lawn. It makes a lining which looks
almost like chiffon.
A needlework and insertion waist,
much the worse for wear, has been cut
down until there is nothing of It but
stock and bertha and undersleeves.
This will be worn under a shirt waist
that is rounding in the neck and short
In the sleeves. And several threadbare
old waists of white lawn, India linen,
chiffon and embroidery, have been cut
up to make stocks, berthas, cuffs and
â mailer parts of new waists. The re
making of the old shirt waist Is a
thing not to be overlooked by the one
who is on economy bent and who wants
a nice wardrobe on very little money.
It is a pity that, while on the econ
omy note, one cannot sound the praises
of the new ribbons, which are beauti
ful enough, but very expensive. But,
to the woman who is out looking at
spring bargains, there is this to be said:
If you can find flowered ribbon cheap
by all means buy It. Get enough for
a : handsome sash and get < enough for
a "girdle and for a flounce trimmed and I
maybe a \ little to spare for â¢ a hat or
for bows upon your waist. The flower
ed, the I Dresden, the Pompadour, and
the art nouveau ribbons are"to" be very
much* worn " this year. >â  ; .â¢
\* Ribbon trimmings are to bet both
numerous r and costly and j, there ', will
scarcely ; be . a limit to the . ways ;in
which the bows and the furbelotoa, the
ribbon roses, the ribbon violets, and
the knots are worn.
Â»^So; intricate have the ribbon trim
mings ?â  become "that ' special -ribbon
: workers i are engaged in making them
and -there are dress artists whose
- whole work lies in designing the ribbon
decorations of the spring. B^SmÃ
, , A Chat With a Ribbon Artist.
"The new ways of Wearing ribbons
are most interesting." said one \of
the workers. "We make everything:
from scented violets and perfumed
ribbon ; roses to the most 'â â¢. elaborate
waist trimmings and sash designs.
. "One of the simplest,, though pret
tiest, of ribbon trimmings is the lit
tle ladder of ribbon bows 'which m
arranged ux> the front of .the';* waist.
I made one oÂ£ these . little ladders of
bows out of black velvet ribbon. Each
one was about the size of a tittle black
-butterfly. And all were made with
, mathematical precision, â¢ â¢ precisely
â  alike, the same aiza and finished :in
tire name manner. There were eight
or. ten of them, and they were uae.fl to
close the iron of a blue j>eau tit* sole
evening waist. : * " r>
,'' "l made another little bow ladder of
â -, white satin with a tiny gold buckle *
, In the middle of each very much- like
a slipper buckle. These are also very
accurately made. The trouble with
an amateur ia that she makes her
bows too sloppily. They are of differ
ent sizes and they show/ poor * work
manship. It takes the hand of a pro
fessional. ' . .v.
"A ribbon trimming which Is lovely
for evening waists consists oÂ£ : many
petals of rose colored ribbon arranged
along the front of the bodice ". just
where it outlines the ' neck. , - These
petals, are made of rose-colored rib
bon and are actually shaped like rose
petals. One very lovely petal trim
ming consisted of many of these^ pe
tals in many different , shades of rose
colored ribbon and in white and
cream ribbon. They were ; arranged
along the neck of the bodice and. at
one side- there was a big bow of rose
colored silk. > -
â * "You can do perfect miracles with
the sashes of the summer." said this
ribbon worker. ."I take wide ribbon
and make a girdle of it so that It has
the appearance of carelessness. At
the back I knot the ends and make
beautiful great big handsome bows.
These can be attached to the skirt to
make a handsome trimming.
"But the newest trimming of the year
in the ribbon line is the knot of ribbon
which was described by the old-time
novelists as a 'snood.' The heroines
of - other days invariably wore a snood
of blue . ribbon in their auburn locks
and the belle of to-day also wears a
snood. j f j,. ;
"To make a ribbon snood you make
a rather elaborate knot which is Ilka
a double knot with the middle pulled
out. To make a fat puff there- are no
loops or bows at all. But there are
two ends which are out in pigeon wing
fashion. I make a snood for the side
of the pompadour; another for the
back of the hair and several for the
bodice. It requires some little skill to
make a snood as it should be > made,
but I find it well repays my time and
trouble, for it Is becoming. ","
The Delicate Summer Touches.
"The ribbon trimmings that are ar
ranged around the tops of the summer
flounces are of a kind to be taken off
In the laundry. There are knots" of
ribbon connected by loops of the same.
And the whole is then set around the
head of a flounce, where it serves as a
very handsome finish. Â£
"Here is a gown which ; depends
largely upon its ribbon treatment. The
material Is a handsome silk challie with
a cream ground, upon which there are
small pink and green figures. The skirt
is one of those very full summer skirts
cut round. , There is a deep flounce
around the foot. And the top of the
flounce is. gathered half a dozen times.
At thÂ« head there is a trimming of
Oriental lace, and this is caught in
place with knots of pink ribbon, each
knot connected with the next' one with
a strip of pink ribbon. ;. .**.'.â .;â¢;
"Many of : the pretty ribbon trim
mings have a little art nouveau button,
no bigger than thÂ« head of a full grown .
â¢ pin, -In the middle of each knot. 4 If
the gown is intended for a. piazza srown
and â¢if it has a tasteful ribbon ' treat
ment It will have ;no difficulty tp..tak
ing its place along with 1 the finest. silk
mull, even though it be i only .a \ cheap
figured lawn." . y^ â¢'â¢â¢*â  --.â¢' : â¢.
To ? depart â¢ a little from thÂ»,. ribbons
of the season one may just touch, upon
the skirts which are necessary to .the
success of the shirt waist. There are.
as every skirt maker know*;, two .ways
of making the full summer skirt. One
way is by making It of many gores.
" And the other way is by cutting the
summer skirt circular. In t either case
the skirt 13 very full around; the foot.
One can do a great deal with; the cir
cular skirts. And , one can do a lot
with the gathered skirts, which v are
- tucked or gathered around the hips and
- made elaborate by their methods of
being finished. * - 1
There is such a fancy for the short
( skirt ; that ' Dame Fashion for a time
refuses to look at the very long one.
The long skirt is worn by women who
feel that it adds to their height. But
the taller . woman will , almost always
choose the skirt which Is : cut so that
â¢; it clears the . ground, feeling that tt 13
more comfortable and newer." ââ ':
2 There -is something Â« new in the skirt
- line and -. this Is : the * teildency to trim
the yoke to match the shirt waist. A
" shirt wai3t made of white embroidery
~is worn with a shirt whose yoke la f
trimmed to match the waist. There
is quits a knack in doing this well, and
the .woman who ..will study this is
pretty '. sure lof ' something : that will
dress up her costume. .
â¢ - i For a final ; word on the ,; subject of
; shirt ; waists ~ there â ; may { be > mentioned
the admonition given by a fashionable

1 two great events in
Ha operatic histor;
the production of "Par
sifal" and the appearance ot
Caruso. San Francisco may bt
away out on the fringe of the
â¢wild and woolly West, but we have
Tetrazzini's word for it that San Fran
cisco has musical appreciation. If that
were not*enough we have the Metro
politan Opera-house Company, with its
etrongett stars, songbirds who are at
the very zenith of a world fame,
eht out here and displayed in ali
their glittering plumage with all the
wonderful scenic appurtenances to en
hance their personalities that have
made the Metropolitan Opera-house
productions the talk of the world.
â¢"Parsifal." that sublime evidence of
the Wagnerian genius, had never been
produced outside of the Wagnerian
Theater at Bayreuth until Conreid pro
duced it at New York in the winter of
IKI3, arousing an enthusiasm that was
rational. And now, thanks to the
courage and determination with which
Mr. Conreid fought for what he be
lieved to be his right to wrest Richard
Wfcpner's work from the exclusive
grasp of Bayreuth. California will be
enabled to enjoy that famous work
without crossing the Atlantic or the
Pacific. It has universally been con
ceded by all Americans who have wit
nessed both the Wagnerian productions
at Bayreuth and the- Conreid produc
tions at th* Metropolitan Opera-house
that the Bayreuth production never
approached even remotely in majesty
and splendor the production put on by
Conreid.
The artists entrusted with the pro
duction of the Wagner drama are at
the present hour unrivaled in their re
speciivt characters. They will include
I illian Nordica. unquestionably the
I test dramatic soprano in the world,
will alternate in the role of Kun
w,th Olivp Frcnistadt. who has
described as "the most radiantly
itiful woman on the operatic
c." Alois Burgstaller, the greatest
ving Gtrman tenors, will sing the
role, and Anton Van Rooy, the
' Ucrmu barytones, will sing
character of Amfortas. Otto Go
\\ ho enjoys an eminence almost
as great as that of Van Root will sing
the role of K!ini?'or, and Robert Blass.
the great role of Gornemanz. The
<>;>Â«- ra will be conducted by Alfred
Hertz, whose conducting of the per
formances of 'Parsifal" in New York
(Sibed for him a most eminent repute.
The biggest feature on the Italian
Bide of the opera season will undoubt
edly be the appearances of Caruso,
whose voice has been proclaimed by en
thusiastic admirers as the most re
markable voice of any living tenor. It
we may believe all the stories that drift
out to this coast his voice possesses
many of the qualities that made the
voice of Mario â In his day the idoi
of grand opera-goers â famous, aided by
' individual characteristics which in a
remarkably short time have made En
rico Caruso the wonder of two conti
nents. His first successes were scored

about eight years ago fn Ttalr. and
from that time to this his reputa
tion has grown with amazing ra
pidity. Caruso is now a little over
30. Although he lays no claim to
being an Adonis, his personality
is sympathetic and engaging.
Caruso's repertoire includes the
chief lyric tenor parts in the
Italian operas, among them
Ftadames in "Aida." the Duke
in "Rigoletto." Edgardo in
"Lucia." Nemorino in "L'Eli
Â»ir d'Amore," Canio in
"Pagliacei," Manrico in
'â¢Trovittore." Rodolpho in
*La Boheme" and the
heroes in "Don Pas

â Mar.Â»f Lesc-ii'it."
N jthing need be said
about Lillian Nordica.

the greatest of dra
matic sopranos, nor
of Marcella Sem

whom will be seen
with the Conried
organization. Sera
brich will sing in
the Italian operas
with Caruso.
But of all the
newer names and
more familiar fig
ures that will ap
pear, the one that arouses
the keenest curiosity on the part of
Ran Francisco opera-goers is that of Olive
Fermstadt. who is to appear in San Francisco
for the first time in the exacting role of Kun
dry the enchantress, in "Parsifal." By birth
a native of Sweden, her girlhood and young
womanhood were passed in Minneapolis and
New York, so she is to all intents and purposes
an American woman. Her first appearances
were in this country on the concert platrorm.
Tier taste, her temperament and her ambition.
however, predestined her to grand opera, and
on going abroad to complete her musical
atudies she proceeded to Berlin, where, under
the tuition of Lilli Lehman, she developed the
â wonderful vocal and dramatic qualities with
which she is so magnificently endowed. In
Germany she mastered the chief mezzo
soprano and some of the dramatic soprano
parts in the Wagnerian repertoire, in addi
tion to others, such as Carmen and Santuzza.
Beautiful, as few singers now on the lyric
stage are beautiful, temperamental, gifted
with a naturally pure, rich golden voice.
which she has learned to control skillfully,
an artist to the finger tips â dramatic to a
fault and yet at no time melodramatic â
Olive Fremstadt should be an ideal
Kundrv.
In" "Parsifal" also will be heard un
questionably the greatest of living Ger
man tenors, Alos Burgstaller. Burg
staller, who is not 34 years old, was born
in the mountain country of Upper Ba
varia, where he lived until manhood the
simple life of a peasant mountaineer. In
1892 he was discovered by Levy, the
famous Munich impresario, who was sc
greatly impressed with the beauty ana
promise of the young man's voice thai
he persuaded the young man's family
to let him take him to Bayreuth.
There, under Frau Colima Wagner, h*
studied for six years, devoting himself
chiefly, although not exclusively, tc
Wagner. In 1896 he sang the part of
young Siegfried, also the mature
Siegfried in "Gotterdaemmerung"
and Froh in "Das Rheingold."
In 1898 he sang Parsifal and Seig
fried in "Walkuere." He starred at
various times between 1596 and 1902
in Holland. Russia, France and Ger
many, singing the chief tenor parts in
the "Ring dcs Nibelungen" and several
other roles, among them Max in "Der
Freischutz." Floristan in "Fldelio " and
Hans in Siegfried Wagner's opera.
â¢Der Barenhauter." In 1902, with Van
Dyck and other eminent artists, he ap
peared in a series of Wagnerian per
formances at the theater dv Chateau
d'Eau, singing, under the musical
uireetion alternately of Mottl and
Richter, the part of mature Siegfried
in "Goettertlaemmerung." in his native
German. His reception in the city
which was once rq hostile to Wagner
and to all things German was most en
thusiastic.

Monism
Based on Biology.
y*% RNEST HAECKEL, the great
ly Â«st living exponent of the phil-
M .^ o*ophy of monism, who just at
the time of the birth of the new '
century made the public so much, in
terested in that system of thought by
his famous book. "The Riddle of the
Universe," has now, in his seventieth
year, published another work on the
same subject, called "The Wonders of
Life." The object of the former effort
was the construction of a rational and
solid philosophy, and that distinctly In
opposition to 'â¢conventional ideas ai: 1
an outworn revelation." He feels that
the continued and general opposition to
his solution of the "riddle" compels
, him to give a further explanation of
the chief features of his theory of
knowledge. "â '''â¢,
Haeckel's work in advocacy of the
monistic philosophy gets much of its
value from the fact that it is not mere
ly a metaphysical speculation, but is
based on a thorough study of biology,
in which this its aged maintains- is a
master of thirty-eight years' experi
ence. He has studied biology, and uses
the term in his present work in the
broadest sense of the name. He says:
"'Like every other science, biology has
a general and a special part. General
biology contains general information
about Hvjng nature: this is the subject
of the present study of the wonders of
life. We might also describe It as a
biological philosophy. â¢ â¢ â¢" The in-"
terest in the book might be divided
into two distinct branches: the won
ders of life just considered as informa
tion in biology given and explained by
an expert: and. second, the philosoph
ical opinions derived therefrom with
which he attempts to solve the riddle
of the universe.
This solution of his is, of course, but
another name for materialism, but it is
materialism carried to its highest sci
entific statement possible at the pres
ent time. It is. as Haeckel acknowl
edges, the minority opinion; it is the
emphatic denial of dualism in all its
fcrms; of the philosophy of Plato, of
Aristotle, of his own great fellow coun
tryman. Kant: of Judaism, of Chris
tianity, and of the thought of all those
who, though belonging to no special
treed, yet believe thai there is a real
ity of truth corresponding to such ex
pressions as God and his world, mind
and matter, spiritual and material; it
denies that there is soul in man cap
able of living on after the destruction
of the material brain, or that thire is
Â«ny creator or creative power; it is the
pantheistic thought of the beginning of
the twentieth century. In no other
two general systems does philosophy
divide so completely and antagonist. l â¢
cally as in those of monism and dual
' ism. Haeckel express-;* it as his opin
i ion that this "antithesis of monism and
'dualism is the most important In the
; whole history of philosophy; all other
systems are only variations of o-ne or
thf other." . -,w!^ "Â«-
"The remarkable success of "The Rid
dle of the Universe" would seem to
justify the publication of . this supple-
j menting and explaining of the thought
,in "The onders of Life." The sur
â¢ prise of the large call for the former
book was that although it was on a
' scientific subject and by no means light
S reading, the first issue of 10,000 copies
j was exhausted in three months, and of
I the succeeding popular edition 100.000
; were sold within the year. No doubt
the attention-catching title of the book
was part of the secret of so many
wishing to read it. It is about the
great puzzle, and when a philosopher
has solved ft' to his own assured satis
faction people are naturally eager to
know his answer, and how he arrived
at it. So It was translated into twelve
languages in 1900. It will revive same
interest in the work to know that the
author still holds to his opinions' and
that the principles developed by him
thirty-eight years ago have only been
confirmed by his subsequent study.
Haeckel's particular form of monism
is now called hyloism, and it is his '
expression of what he believes to be
a fact that all substance has two fun
damental attributes; as matter (hylo),
It occupies space, and a* force, or
energy, it is endowed with sensation.
He devotes a. whole chapter to what
he understands by "sensation": "Our
monistic system (whether it be taken
as materialism â¢or â¢ 'n?rglsm. or more
correctly as hyloism) regards all sub
stance as having soul'â that is to say,
endowed with energy. â¢ â¢ â¢ All bodies
are in a certain sense 'sensitive.* It is
just in this dynamic conception of suh
stanc. that monism differs essentially
from the materialistic system, which
regards one part of matter as 'dead'
and insensitive." His philosophy is a
blending of the chemical law of the
constancy of matter, as upheld by
Lavoisier, with the physical law of the
constancy of force, as expressed by
Meyer. In the search for truth he
recognizes only two paths, empirical
knowledge and the speculation built
thereon. He denies the correctness of
Kant's division of knowledge into
"priori" and "posteriori," in so far as
priori, or "pure reason," meant there
was a mode of ascertainment of truth
as aside from what we gain from ex
perience. That power of the mind
which Kant considers as able to rea
son correctly without the assistance of
experience, HaeckeJ. believes, to be a
higher function of the brain built up
by evolution through the ages of ex
perience of the developing human
being. He has no belief in the soul as
a supernatural entity; but "the lofty
self -consciousness of man differs only
in degree, not In kind, from that of the
ape, the .dog. the horse, and other
higher mammals."
The most interesting feature of the
book, both from a. biological point of
view as expressing his actual knowl
edge, and a philosophical standpoint, as
explaining his speculations . based upon
It, Is in his account of that highest de
velopment of the human brain cells
which he calls the "soul" of man. it
will, sound tome thing akin to blas
phemy'- to those* devoted/ to dualism
when the word "soul" is used to "name
the material .' in a' man's skull
which perishes when a man ; dies;
but such is the form of ex
pression Haeckel chooses in pro
claiming his denial that man has an
immortal soul. To him ."those groups
c.f psychic cells which we must regard
as the agents of the higher mental
iaculties" are not, as the dualist be
lieves, the organ by means of which
the soul communicates with the ma
terial world, but they are the "soul"
itself, and all there is to it. But dual
ists and monists alike can listen with
keen interest to the man as he speaks
in the character of biologist and tells
us of the five millions of years, in the
Tertiary period, though which this
highest organ of the brain, he calls the
"phronema." was developing to its
present place as the highest achieve
ment ofl nature. In it "millions of
phrcnetal cells and thousands of mil
lions of tbÂ« finest nerve fibrils repre
sent the wires which connect the sta
tions with one another, and with the
sense centers on the one hand and the
motor centers on the other." "Investi
gations ,of the finer texture of
the gray cortex (or cortical sub
stance of the cerebrum) have shown
that its structure, a real anatomic
wonder of life,' is the highest achieve
ment that we know anywhere in na
ture. Millions of psychic cells, or
r.eurona â each of them of an elaborate
fibril molecular structure â are associ
ated as special thought-organs at cer
tain parts of the cortex, and these
again are built up into a 4arge har
monious system of wonderful regular
ity and capacity. â¢ â¢ Scientists
are all agreed that there is such a cen
tral organ of the mind, and that its
ncrma! anatomic and chemical condi
tion is the first requisite for the life of
the human *mind. This belief, one of
the foundations of the monistic psy
chology, is confirmed by the study of
psychiatry."
Whatever system of thought a reader
may have personal preference for, he
finds it interesting to have a philosphy
stated by its ablest exponent. If he
approves, it pleases him with a cor
roboration of his own views; if he doss
not aci ept it, he is glad to have ssen
the strongest setting forth of that
v. hich he believes is error, and can
usually find freEh rejoicing in his own
faith by using the other as a foil to
set it off. So will Haerkel's work be of
value to minds of the two differing
systems of thought, dualism and mon
ism; and a'so of use to people who
love to study the mind of man In all its
\ariations of belief, especially when the
men are of noteworthy character and
talent. Could not such a student of his
fellow man contrast thiÃ work of
Haeckel's most interestingly with Car
dinal Newman's account of how he
reached the, to him. certitude of God
and the immortal soul-?

A Gift
To America
(f I am able to offer is
. //^very little, if I consider all .
*"^"^ that you will give to me^
But that very little will be
given heartily. I bring you the best
part of myself, the Inmost and very
precious part of a ~ man's experience,
the result of his labor and of the work-"
Ing of God in his soul â in one word my
faith; that of which I live, that which,
in the deepest secret of my. own self, 11 ' Is â¢
my inspiring; spirit." This is the gift
which Charles Wagner brought â¢ to;
America when he came over " from
France as a result of President Roose
velt's appreciation of his .work," and in- â "
vitation to visit him if :he ever came
to our shores. : .
Seldom is so small a book of so large â¢
importance as ; Wagner's new fifty-five ,
page publication called "My Appeal to t
the American People," being his first-,
address â to 4an American , audience. ilt Â£
is important because it explains r that
power â power In simplicity, by which a
man. speaking in i a simple : way upon 'â 'â â 
subjects in no way sensational, or even :
new. almost ? suddenly gained an audi- -:
ence beyond all .; comparison greater
than that of any other preacher of , our â¢'-;
time, so nearly everybody has read his
, little book called â¢ the "Simple Life," ..
that surely nearly everybody will wish
to know something' of the r genesis of
the simple thing that suddenly grew so;
great and of the development of l- t -the;',
character and capacity of the man who
did it. Critics may say ; there ;. is not
enough of merit in his- work to account
for Its astonishing success: but that
success does not shine , any, the less se
renely and far-reachingly because of
the doubt ; that ' there la genuine ; power \
at the source . of this shining! â . - : - 'â â â : . . j : ,
Lyrhan Abbot, in ; explaining his view
of why such >a* multitude are listening :'
to Wagner, mentions, among oth?r
things, his pictorial imagination and
his mastery of style. These are reasons
which Wagner could not, of course,
give of his success, but no doubt he
would measup,- them, if he realized
them, as among the least of his powers
to draw attention. That some of
his pages are worth reading for their
literary art alone few would deny who<
have- felt the grace of that little illus
tration he wrote â out of the anguish
â¢if parental bereavementâ about hope's
return when memory called up the
mental picture of the time when, once
before, he had lost the child, but after
almost despairing search had at.
last hrard him prattling merrily be
hind a high garden wall. It would al
most seem as if a loving Providence
had .given him that first little grief in
order to prepare him for the right way
to boar the greater grief which was to
come. Still, if he could but hear it,
the child may be talking happily, but
the wall makes a wider separation now,
and no sounds come through.
Wagner's mo6t read book, "The Sim
ple Life," had its humble beginning in
a little talk ho made at the marriage
of Mrs. Quinet'B maid. This so pleased
Mr*. Quinet's daughter that he was
asked to speak in exactly the same way
at her wedding; and this happened to
be before a thousand people and "those
among the cleveres.t in Paris. This
pleased so much that one of the
foremost publishers of Paris wrote him
a letter calling for a book on the sub
ject of the address. "I had the book
in myself without knowing it."
Concerning "The Better Way." he
sayE, 'I wrote it in grief and ansruish.
and suffering hearts understood it."
Of "By the Fireside," which though
not so much read as the "Simple
Life," is considered the best book he
has produced, he says, "This book was
â written to pay a debt of gratitude to
family life which gave me so much,
und which I hold the cornerstone of
human life." His next publication will
be his sketch book entitled "The Soul
of Things," and Is written, he gays,
by "the poet that lives In my heart."
Explaining how talks on simplicity are
so much appreciated in this complex
now, be says that no time needs more
to be taught simplicity than a time
like ours. It needs simplicity like a
dry land needs water. Then he tells
of the French port's (Jean Aicard)
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
lines, describing tne desert of Sahara:
"All the great desert dreams but one
dreamâ a drop of water to make a
flower."
If we wonder why such multitudes of
people like to read him, let one of the
letters received by him tell of at least
part of the reason: "We love your
books because they are a heio to liv
ing; they induce us to act and to love:
they are like a sunbeam which warms
th soul." (McClure, Phillips & Co..

GreeK Girl
American Lover
THAT the scene of George Hor
ton's new novel is laid In Greece
seems very natural when we
learn that he has recently been ap
pointed United States Consul to Ath
ens, and that it is reported his selec
tion for that post is due in part to the
administration's desire to encourage
and reward literary talent. Horton
held the same Consulship under Cleve
land's administration, and the land is
not only familiar to him in layman
fashion, but also he has been there be
fore as a literary artist, as his "Long
Straight Road" and "The Tempting of
Father Anthony" reveal. His latest
story, "The Monk's Treasure," is skill
fully set amidst Greek scenery, which
he loves to describe, and relates the
adventures of an American who be
comes enamored of a beautiful Greek
bondgirl. The pleasing picturing of
this graceful "lady of sorrows" sup
plies the most of merit there is in the
book. This Polyxene is the precious
thing of the author's effort, but the
reader must not guess too soon that
she is the monk's treasure.
In describing that portion of the
earth wherein he makes his human
creations s^eak and act before us the
writer evidences his enjoyment of na
ture's beauty, and considerable power
to transmit that joy to others by his
summoning of mental images. Some
times he does this so well that he
makes us wish he had practiced a Ht-
Ue more the art of elimination so that
the beauty of some of his finer sen
tences might not have been lessened
by the addition of ones which add not
to excellence, but rather subtract from
what else had been more completely
pleasing. An example of this beauty
and of this blemish comes close to the
beginning, where he should have been
more careful to be making a more un
flawed good Impression on his readers.
There he tells us that "They climbed
down into the sailboat * * * and
were soon flitting toward the little
town, and even as they approached
the sun sank suddenly out of sight as
it does where the edge of the world
is piled with mountains. A purple
glow, too beautiful to last, flushed the
air with glory and began to fade.
â¢ â¢ â¢ A convent bell rang sweetly,
faintly somewhere in the hills, and
that mysterious feeling of sadness per
vaded the air which is ever the at
tribute of ultimate beauty." Surely
that is a beautiful word picture.
Surely, too, it should not have been;
spoiled by this far inferior sentence
which Horton thoughtlessly adds to
the paragraph: "When they stepped
upon the beach it was as dark as it
ever can be In a country where the
stars are rose diamonds." The essen
tial element of beauty which that sen
tence lacks is truth: it would certainly
be darker, evefl In that country, when
those rose diamond stars were cloud,
bedimmed. Besides, even if the saying
had been beautifully true, it did not
belong to the paragraph onto which it
was tacked, for that, to be exquisite,
had reached its tactful Uma to emit
when' the convent balls were rimtinrâ
sweetly, faintly, somewhere in th
hills, which we picture as still flushed
with sunset's purple glow.
That picture is the preparation tor
our hearts before into our fiction life
is brought this new acquaintance, "the
lady of sorrows," the beautiful Greek
bondgirl, who washes clothes and cuts
firewood, and carries water gracefully
on her fair shoulders, and '.veeps piti
fully in the night because she is be
trothed to one unto whose arms she is
not- eager to go. That's where the
thrill of the story begins â with this
midnight weeping, and the hearing of
it by, the American. The grief had not
the taint of being willfully or weakly
given way to, but in its intensity bore
evidence of attempted suppression. So
the American thought > "This woman.
had it been possible, would not have
sobbed at all." That was a germ
thought in his mmd â lovi* was born of
ft; and so the story comes. It is worth,
swift, skimming reading. Just for A lit
tle passing fictitious love of the fair
Greek girl.

Return of
SHerlock Holmes
THE warm welcome of "The Re
turn of Sherlock Holmes" is one
of the assured things which he,
ir. common with all other* old and en
tertaining friends, can count upon as
cure as the laws of natural conse
quence. The collection of- stories which
censtitutss Dr. Conan Doyle's return
in the character of the most famous
of fictitious sleuths is now put in book
form, and the people who love to fol
low the mental gymnastics of the as
tute detective in tracing cut clews
which are too tangled for any but the
cleverest criminal catcher to make a
guidance will find enough in the thir
teen adventures to satisfy their appe
tite for the contemplation of miscre
ants being traced and brought to jus
tice by a brain that gives its best, en
ergies out of sheer love of the pursuit.
Certainly there is an absorbing fas
cination in it, and also it may be true
that not wholly idly will the hours
have been spent In reading these ex
amples of the shrewd exercise of the
faculty of inference. Each mind may
out of the act of following this
master in the art of developing
the unknown from the known increase
its own gifts in that line; for, as we
are told in th^ indenture of -Wilhelm
Meistcr's apprenticeship, that is the
tiick the learning of which makes the
pupil gradually become a master In
any of life's great arts or professions â
be it the detecting of devilish crim
inals or the carving of divine marbles.
A good specimen of combining the
two forms of reasoning from ascer
tained facts to further, but still hid
den, facts, and from conjectured
truths back to the finding: of solid
foundations under them, just where
they were prevised to be, is in the
seventh story, called 'The Adventures
of the Six Napoleons." To start a
search from both these sources for the
unknown but needed truth and find
the pointers converging is a method
something like making security doubly
sure, both as to the solving of a prob
lem, and the * corroboration of one's
mind's assurance that the found solu
tion is too surely right to be upset
by the discovery of any new facts.
In the " Advent ure o f tne p r j ory
Sehctol." besides the value of the story
as a mere mind rest and pleasure, and
the exercise of watching the ingenuity
of fts unfolding, there lies this elucida
tion on the ruth of life and the art of
living it â in the whole story as in the
sentence: "When a man embarks up
on a crime he is morally guilty of all
the others which may spring from
it."
It would be an item of curious in
terest in the study of psychology if it
could be ascertained whether, or no.
the exercise of writing, or the serious
study of such, tracings of fictitious
primes would be of any assistance to
a mind engaged !n finding who are thm
perpetrators of the secret crimes of
the real world.

Physician
Talks of Health
Â£* OME good advice on how to keep
% well by a physician, who has had
thirty years' experience, is given
ir a book of 229 pages, called "Health
and Disease," by Dr. C. G. R. Moutoux
ot Oakland. Cal. It is a popular ex
pc sition on the essentials of health
causes of disease and the care of the
sick and convalescent. It has an ap
pendix containing essays on special
physiological subject*
Much of the book Is taken up with
the giving of (.ommonsense rules for
the ways of keeping out of a doctor's
hands. The author does not believe in
tho power of physicians to do any
more than assist nature in making a
cure, and that right living, the avoid
ance of fright, worry and anger and
the mastery of the evil tendency of
the- imagination to make people
imagine they are ailirjg, or to intensify
;t slight ailment by letting the- mind
dwell on the subject In * foreboding
way, are of much more importance in
the securing of health than the taking
of drugs. He believes that in treating
diseases all extremes of any special
system or method are of questionable
value, and that success may of fen be
attained by combining the doctrines of
several systems, as may prove most
rational. So he would use allopathy,
hemeopathy, eclecticism and sugges
tion as he found each case's peculiarity
rt Quired.
Pie quotes with approval from thÂ«
famous Dr. Boerhave the following
prescription to insure health: Keep the
head cool, the feet warm, the bowels
open, and â the" doctor your distant
friend.
Dr. Moutoux has made a special
strdy of physical degeneration, and
expresses the opinioa that the human
race in civilized countries is gradually
retrograding so far as physical condi
tion is concerned.

Briefer Mention .
"Saints and Festivals of the Chris
tian Church." by H. Pomeroy Brew
ster. the author of "Christian Sym
bols, " Is a well arranged book of 558
pages, telling of the saints and festi
vals in the regular order of the dates
throughout the year, and with an al
phabetical list of the canonized saints
and a good index. As the number of
Christian saints are too many to be
told of in one book, the author only
mentions the most prominent, and as
the popular legends are often the only
records of them, he had to give these
as he found them, and he makes no
attempt to either prove or deny the
authenittcity or error of any of the
legends. The work is profusely illus
trated with quaint old pictures of the
saints and with Christian emblems.
The work Is commendable as a good
piece of condensation. Each article
he- handles, be it an explanation of
Holy Saturday, a page on symbols, or
an account of some great saint, is
done with Interesting brevity. Take,
fcrr an example, how he swiftly gives
us a glance at that great woman.
Saint Catherine of Siena: "When in
1375 the people of Florence, Perugia, a
great part of Tuscany and even the
ecclesiastical state, entered into a
league against the Holy See and were
Catherine was 33
lected as mediator. Her keen wiadom
and rare judgment not only brought
about a reconciliation, but more, since
she not only saw but dared to show
where acme of the moving causes lay
and secured their correction. Her Ufa
is full of atirring incident and without
verging a hair's breadth from strict
truth, it became almost a romance in
seme of the situations in whfch we flnd
her as a nurse at the bedside of those
afflicted by the most loathsome dis
eases, then as the adviser of nobles,
and later the intermediary between
thousands and the high authority of
the church. Worn out, not rusted out
after an. easy life, this wonderful
woman died when but thirty-three
years of age."
(Frederick A. Stokes Company, New
York; $2.)
Under the title of 'America's Aid to
Germany in 1870-71." a German named
Adolph Hepner has published a book,
written In English and German on al
ternate pages, giving an abstract from
the official correspondence of E. B.
Washburne. United States Embassa
dor to Paris at the time of the Franco-
German war. Washburne had the very
difficult and delicate task of protect
ing the 30.000 Germans who were livina
in the French capital at that troub
lous time, and he performed it so well
as to gain the appreciation of the Ger
mans who knew of the details of his
work. The purpose of the book is to
make known to the public that which
has h'therto not been recognized out
side of the highest official circles, and
Hepner hopes that it will serve as an
additional impulse to his countrymen
to cultivate a sincere friendship for
the United States. The author also
hopes that the story told by the cor
respondence will warn tnose who are
anxious to fight not to recklessly enter
into a war with a country in whose
capital tens of thousands of their kins
men have made their homes.
An extract, culled at random, from
the letters of Count Bismarck to Mr-
Washburne, adds something to our
knowledge of the necessity of being
suspicious of respectable human na
ture: "Sirâ Recent and repeated exoe
rlenc-e has shown that even resoect
able persons, in spite of the warning
addressed to them before leaving Paris,
and relying upon our confidence, do not
hesitate to carry letters clandestinely
through our lines. Nay. in several let
ters captured by our men. indications
are given to address the information
they are desired to give in the interest
of the enemy to certain persons in
Paris bearing a diplomatic character. "

COMPLETION OF SIMPLON TUNNEL UNDER THE ALPS
ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST ENGINEERING FEATS
Bore Over One Mile
Below Summit
of Peaks.
Vast Obstacles Overcome
Subterranean Flood
and Heat Delay
the Work.
Special Cable to The Call.-
LONDON. March Piercing . the
heart of the mighty Alps in a bee line
for twelve and a quarter miles, the
Eimplon tunnel, the longest in the
world, and the greatest underground
engineering feat ever undertaken, has
just been completed.
The obstacles encountered have been
many and stupendous. Nature has op
posed with all the might of her sub
terranean forces the invasion of the in
trepid human burrowers. . Landslides
have intervened to stay their advance.
Heat has done Its best to baffle them.
Imprisoned streams, ccid springs and
hot springs have burst . forth from the
bowels of the earth dissharsing some
times from 10,000 to 15,000 gallons a
minute, to overwhelm and destroy
them.
These things have greatly retarded
the progress of the engineers, occasion
ally causing them to halt for weeks
while they summoned fresh powers of
science to their aid; at other times re
ducing their advance by boring and
blasting to a few inches a <lay. But
never were they beaten; never -id they
deviate by a hair's breadth from the
straight course that had been mapped
out for them.
FLOOD OF BOILING WATER.
Last October, when only two hundred
yard* separated the Swiss and Italian
sections, the pent-up forces of old
earth, as though bent on a last su
preme effort to put an end to the at
tacks of dynamite and hydraulic drill,
let loose a "boiling flood." That was
how it "was described at the time,
though to be precise the temperature
of the water was 133 degrees Faren
heit â sufficient to put a stop to
human labor when the rate of flow
was several hundred gallons a second.
By the skill of . the engineers i none
of the water from the hot flood reached
the workmen until it. had been diluted
with cold water from the hydraulic
mains. At the same time the tempera
ture of the air was cooled some
twenty-five degrees by means of a
high-pressure water-spraf. And after
a while the men were able to continue
their tasks .in a comfortable sort of
shower bath. â¢. â¢ -
In the building of the Simplon, forces
.Ture, harnessed and controlled,
have been employed to combat other
forces of nature, wild and rebellious,
r.derously passive. Water derived

ne Diveria on the Italian

en th< hydraulic drills through the
adamantine rock, subdued and d
ed the subterranean floods and forced
into the tunnel the fresh air and cool

would otherwise have been a suffocat
ing inferno.
CARE OF HUMAN" LIFE.
The crowning glory of the Achieve
ment lies in the success of the mea
sures adopted for safeguarding hu
man life and health under conditions
of deadly and stupendous peril.
The St. Gothard tunnel, three milÂ«s
shorter, and where the natural ob
stacles encountered were far less seri
ous, claimed a toll of 600 lives, 400 from
pneumonia or "tunnel worm," and 200
by explosions or landslides. In the con
struction of the Simplon tunnel not one
single case of miner's phthisis has oc
curred among the 3000 laborers en
gaged on the borings, while only a
dozen men have been killed at the
works during the more than six years
that they have been in progress.
It was decided that the trucks of
the Simplon tunnel should not be car
ried to a greater altitude than 2310
feet, the Swiss entrance at Brigue be
ing 2250 feet and the Italian one at
IÂ«el3e 207"5 feet above sea level.
The great depth of the perforation
under the surface â at the summit ex
ceeding 7000 feet â made it impossible to
sink vertical shafts for purposes of
ventilation. Weight involves pressure
and pressure produces heat. At the
middle of the tunnel It was estimated
that the crushing weight of the great
superincumbent mass of mountain
would heat the rock there to be bored
through to a temperature approxi
mately 110 degrees.
The contract for the colossal work
was undertaken by Brandt, Brajidaa A
Co. of Hamburg and their preparations
were made with characteristic German
foresight and thoroughness. To cope
with all the obstacles, so vastly great
er than those encountered in any other
subterranean railways, a form of con
struction was adopted differing from
that of the three Alpine tunnels al
ready built.
TWIN TUXXmÂ» PLAN.
They are all double-track single tun
nels. The Simr>lon consists of twin
single-track tunnels, fifty-six feet
apart, and connected with one another
by transverse galleries at intervals of
BO yards. In this way each tunnel
serves as a ventilating shaft for the
other. The twin perforations have been
pushed through simultaneously, but
only one, that of the eastern side, has
been hewn out to its full dimensions.
T'ntil the traffic demands a second
track No. 2 tunnel will serve merely as
a ventilating shaft.
While the work of excavation has
been und^r way this subsidiary tunnel
has served as a drain to carry off the
Roods that have gushed from the
interior, to transmit in mains the
glacial water needed to cool the air
and the heated surface of the rock and
dilute the hot springs.
By wateroower-driven fans pure
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1905.
Alpine air is forced into the tunnels
at the rate of 60,000 cubic feet a min
ute. The hydraulic power which works
the Brandt drills is obtained for the
Swiss cutting by gravity from the
Rhone, the water being brought down
from a point three miles hipher up the
valley. At the works turbines of 2225
horsepower each generate and trans
mit through a hydraulic main a pres
sure giving ten tonÃ upon the cutting
point of each drill. On the Italian side
similar power is derived from the
Diveria in much the same fashion.
WONDERFUL MACHINES.
Wonderful machines are these Brandt
drills. They are the Maxim guns of
subterranean borings. Like Maxims,
one of their advantages is extreme
portability, for only four men are re
quired to work and carry the drill.
With three machines, which can all be
fixed on one carriage, six holes can be
drilled in a little over two hours In
the hardest rock. The compressed air
drills used in the St. Gothard tunnel
necessitated sixteen attendants and a
cumbersome carriage. The Brandt
drill has rendered possible a rate of
progress never before attained in simi
lar tunnel borings, frequently averag
ing ten yards a day.
Another ingenious Invention of
Brandt's employed In the Simplon tun
nel is a compressed air gun of six and
a half inches caliber and 800 feet in
length, wheih discharges a projectile
containing 900 gallons of water. It is
fired simultaneously with the explosion
of the dynamite cartridges in the holes
made by the drills. This great volume
of water, impelled with tremendous
force, pulverizes and sweeps away the
debris, preventing that accumulation
of dust which plays havoc with miners'
lungs.
Never before has an engineering
work of such magnitude been attended
by such careful provisions for the
safety and comfort of the men. To ob
viate the risks of pneumonia, dressing
halls are provided at either entrance.
On emerging in tralnloads from the
galleries the men are compelled to en
ter these apartments, ready heated for
their reception, and to stay in them
for half an hour, while the temperature
is gradually cooled down to that pre
vailing outside.

APPENDIX BECOMES MERE PLAYTHING
IN THE HANDS OF SKILLED DOCTORS
Sir Frederick Treves Tells of a Thousand Cases He Has Treated
Without a Single Death to Mar His Long Record of Successes.
LONDON, March 18. â If, a* was flip
pantly remarked recently in the edito
rial columns of one London paper, the
removal of the appendix is an essential
qualification for entry into smart soci
ety, the meeting the other night of the
Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society
should have been the occasion of a
smart gathering, for its Interest cen
tered, so to speak, round the appendix.
Those present, numbering more than
200 surgeons and physicians, had two
hours of appendix, and in the course of
Sir Frederick Treves' lucid address,
which opened the discussion, even a
layman had ample occasion to improve
his perfunctory acquaintance with it.
How thoroughly modern the subject
is, was made manifest by a casual in
troductory remark by Sir Frederick
Treves when he mentioned that when
in 1887, before the same society which
now had mustered in force to discuss
complex problems at times presented
by operations, he had first mooted the
advisability of the removal of the ap
pendix in cases of recurrent attacks,
his suggestion had been received with
polite skepticism, not unmixed with de
| rision.
OPERATIONS RARELY FATAL.
Since then a deal of water had flowed
under the bridges. Sir Frederick had
i himself In private practice operated on
i more than 1000 cases without a single
death to mar the success of his record.
One great London hospital records
: within a period of four years a total of
exactly 1000 cases of operation for ap
pendicitis, most of them except when
> the disease had brought about general
Special Cable to The Call.
peritonitis before operative treatment
wae possible, with a mortality of a
little more than 4 per cent. Similar
favorable results were shown by sta
tistics- furnished by several of the
larger general hospitals.
In view of these astonishing figures
it occurred to a lay mind to inquire
of expert opinion as to the fate of those
who, seeing the appendix was not a
modern innovation in the interest of
the mechanism of the human race, had
suffered frnni appendicitis in the dark
ages before the introduction of the
Treves Operation. He was told in a
hurried aside that they were reputed
to be suffering from colic and other
unpleasantnesses ending in "itis," and
that in many of the cases the patient
whose life would now be saved died
of unrecognized appendicitis.
SO3IE CAUSES OF RELAPSE.
The greater part of Sir Frederick
Treves' address was devoted to the
consideration of the causes of relapse
after the removal of the offending ap
pendix, as shown by the recurrence of
attacks. A majority of these are of
too technical a nature to admit of ap
preciation by a layman, but one or
two of them are of more curious in
terest.
The recurrence of the pain is at times
due to the incompleteness of the oper
ation, when the whole appendix has
not entirely been removed. Often again
the pain is due to a sort of neuralgia
in the amputated stomach.
More extraordinary, even to the lay
mind, are cases which have occurred
where the pain altogether Is neurotic, a
question of nerves pure and simple.
Again, mistakes In diagnosis do occur
and before now' man has been deprived
of an offending appendix only to find
Pages 17 to 24
that his trouble had its seat in quite
a different part of his machinery.
Sir Frederick did not, against all
traditions, quote the familiar story of
the man who, to guard against con
tingencies In the event of sudden loss of
consciousness, wore tattooed on his
abdomen, "do not operate, have had
appendix removed three times," but he
told a no less remarkable story of a
patient who had come to him with a
relapse after having undergone an op
eration for removal of the appendix.
Tn Investigating matters Sir Frederick
was able to remove it for him a sec
ond time. On the flrst occasion, pre
sumably, the surgeon had overlooked it.
DANGER WHEN DELAYED.
Much more formidable than the
operation during the quiescent period
after -the attack are those necessitated
by local general peritonitis during the
attack, known as cases of "fulminating
appendicitis," when every hour la of
vital importance. In such cases it Is
always a question of touch and go,
but even in these cases London is able
to record of late a remarkable increase
in the number of cases successfully
.treated.

EARL PLACED
IN WAR OFFICE
Donoughmore in New
Role Gives Much
Promise.
Ssecisl Cable to ThÂ« Call,
LONDON. March n.â Among th#
subscribers of a well known London
press clipping agency is Michael P.
Grace, erstwhile of New York and
now of Battle Abbey, in Sussex. And
the most singular thing about (lric?s
subscription is that he does not re
quire clipipnss ajrfout himself, but he
wants everything rhat is printed
about his son-in-law, th- Earl of
Donoughmore, or about matters with
which hÂ» is identified. -eada
carefully all the clippings supplied
him. post 3 them up in a scrap book,
and if any of them oftW an oppor
tunity for giving any counsel or ad
vice to the young nobleman he de
livers himself of it freely and frankly,
verbally or by letter.
He has constituted himse'.f the
Earl's guide, philosopher and friend.
If hij Lordship doe 3 not amount to a
good deal some day it will not be his
father-in-law's fault. When Lord
Donoughmore had the good fortune
to marry Miss Elena Grace â one of
the "three Graces. " as they have beÂ«n
dubbed in society, because of their
good looks and charming personali
ties^ â he was disposed to take thÂ«
world easy, feeling that his financial
position was assured, at least. But.
so the 3tory goes, Grace gave him to
understand that he had not bargained
for a butterfly Lord as a husband for
his daughter â that he came from a
nation of hard workers and had no
more use for titled idlers than for
plain, every day loafers.
Perhaps he did not put it quite as
strongly as that, but anyhow Lord
Donoughmore availed himself of the
flrst opportunity to don the political
harness in earnest, by getting himself
appointed Under Secretary of War and
urged on by hi 3 father-in-law and his
wife, who is equally ambitious for his
future, he has astonished his friend*
and acquaintances of his bachelor days
by the fashion in which he has buckled
down to work.
There are few men in the Govern
ment service who stick to it closer. He
is only 30 and if diligence and applica
tion can accomplish it he will make
his mark some day. He is a cautious
man who snakes sure of every step
that he takes.
â¢ >n a certain occasion in the House
of Lords when Lord Willoughby de
j Broke pressed him for some definite
1 information on a government matter
â  he replied "I cannot tell more than I
i know." This display of a discretion
I so rare among politicians gave birth to
the nickname of "Dunno 1 more,** which
is likely to stick to him.
Grace is very fond of his son-in-law,
regarding him as a living refutation of
the notion rather popular on the other
side, that a lord must necessarily be
rather a no account sort of chap. They
are as Intimate as father and son and
i pass much of their time together.18
At a recent meeting of Las Torros
sas Parlor the officers, in the presence
*>f a larjre number of members and vis
itors, including Grand Secretary Miss
Laura J. Frakes, manifested their abil
ity to perform the Initiatory work by
conferring the degree on one candi

most favorably commented upon. Un

The work was presented with that per
fectness of adherence to the ritual for
which this parlor is noted. After the
good of the ' order the parlor closed
and the remainder of the evenlne was
devoted to the social feature. There
was the game of "Aunt Sally." fur
nished by First Vice President Miss
Anderson, which was provocative of
much amusement. The first prize, a
handsome picture, was won by Mrs. E.
B. Sullivan, and the booby prize. "Bus

was followed by music, pongs and reci
tations and the serving of a collation.

Woodcraft.
At the open meeting of Golden Gate
Circle of the Women of Woodcraft in
the- Odd Fellows' building in the early
part of March there was a voting con-
Cor the mo6t popular Woman of
Woodcraft in San Francisco. Votes
were catt for fourteen members of the
order, representing Golden Gate. Red

circle?. Th*- tellers were: Neighbors
Ambrose and Tickner of Redwood.
Love and S< huelnhard of Golden Gate,
Morris of Pathfinder, Wicks of San
Echoes from the Lodge Room

The ballot showed that Mrs. M. A.
Mont of Golden Gate Circle, who Is
well known in fraternal societies, had
received the greatest number of votes
and was declared the winner. At a
subsequent meeting of the circle the
member* showed their appreciation of
her having been voted the most popu
lar neighbor of Woodcraft by present
ing her with a beautiful emblematic
pin of the order.
The guards of Excel Circle No. 603,
Women of Woodcraft, gave a very in
teresting entertainment in the Seven
teenth-street Native Sons' Hall on the
night of the second Thursday in March.
A feature of the programme was the
clever introduction of a novelty in the
line of "shadowgraphy" by Miss Grace
Still, captain of the guards. In this she
was ably supported by her guards and
Fred Wheland. During the evening
there were pleasing numbers of music
and literary- selections, after which
there was dancing for two hours.
Odd Fellows.
A very active member of the Re
bekah branch of the Odd Fellows in
this city is Edward B. Warren of Ju
bilee Lodge. Having been shown many
courtesies by members of this lodge, he
tendered them and a select number of
personal friends, not members of the
order, a reception in the parlors of the
American Hotel, on Howard street,
during the early part of the current
month. After a meeting of those In
vited, there was an adjournment to the
dance hall, where to the strains of
pleasing music there was dancing for
an hour. Then the party returned to
the parlors, where a collation and light
refreshments were served and an hour
was spent in a pleasant manner. The
host was assisted by Miss Wells. There
were contributions in the line of enter
tainment by Miss G. Perry, C. B. Lane,
F. Birdshall, who acted as master of
ceremonies, the host and hostess, W.
Hamilton and E. C. Stock. In addition
to these there were present Miss Dolly
Hyams. Minnie F. Dobbin, Dr. Arbo

The thirty-ninth anniversary baH
given by Apollo Lodge in Golden Gate
Hall on the second Wednesday in the
entrant month was another social suc
i ei?s added to the long list of enjoyable
functions that have been given under
the auspices of this lodge. The at
tendance was most gratifying as to
numbers and personnel and the order
of entertainment a very enjoyable one.
The minstrel entertainment that was
given by Jubilee Rebekah Lodge
under the name or "A Night
in Dixie, ' in the Memorial Hall
of the Odd Fellows' building on the
night of the first Tuesday in March
was a decided success. It was a repeti
tion of the minstrel show given some
time before in Lyric Hall by the com
pany of which H. W. Osthorff was the
manager and middleman. There was a

Any California n could forgive M.

Tuesday morning he was to see me, j
and last Tuesday morning I saw him :
not. He had forgotten and wandered
off ocean- ard, like the indefatigable
sightseer that he is. He and Madame t
d'Albert are travelers per excellence, i
They arrived here on Sunday evening.
Mr. Will Greenbaum, to whose love of
the best things in music the city owes
so much, being M. d'Albert's manager, '
was on the watch to receive them. But
the D' Alberts had forgotten all about
such Email matters as managers and
concerts. An unimportant dinner earnÂ©

his â who is equally famous as an
opera-singer (she was Mme. Fink) â (

reveling with the true artists' delight
in the bizarre, alien beauty of the
place. On Monday their explorations

Into the thick of other features accord
ing to the gospel of Baedeker. . It was '
probably only the rain on Wednesday
that quenched their lust of sightseeing
and allowed me my chat with the
virtuoso!
But I was very ready to forgive M. '
d'Albert's defection. It j was profound- j
ly more interesting to j see him after i
than before his recital â a recital that ;
originated feuds to â which that of the
Montagues and Capulets .was as noth
ing. Certainly M. d' Albert' looked harm
less enough as I first saw him off the
stage, runningâ actually running!â
along the corridor of the Palace Hotel.
And gentle, hesitant, as he began to
talk to me, out of the depths of the
huge, green davenport In his room, the
"little giant" looked even less the anar
chic person of the night before. Only
the small, brilliant, mischievous, kindly
brown Â«yes, deeply glinting under the
big musician's brow, gave hint of the
tremendous and willful individuality
before me, an individuality responsible
for an "appasslonata" sonata the night
before, "appassionata." as one" has
never before heard It.
It â¢was of course the "appassaocata"
that came up first, after M. d'Albert's
almost Italian!}' profuse apologies for
setting the time of the chat at the aw
ful hour of half past ten o'clock, I had
asked about the reading: of the slow
movement, through which the pianist
carries the suggestion of the tortured
passion of the allegro.
"You find It quicker than usual?" he
asked.
"Xoâ yes, maybe; but moreâappas
sionato." I hazarded.
"I think." M. d' Albert hesitated. '
looked toward the piano as though be :
wished he could explain on that, "I ,
think that the slow movement should
be not too, too" â
"Calm?" I ventured to supply.
"Ach. no!" he exclaimed. "We have
It in German. What is it? Oh Not
too meek, yea, meek," he repeated with :
entire satisfaction. "After the mad- ;
ness of the opening movement it is â¢
not logical to make the andante so
meek as It is usually made. The pas
slon still troubles, wells up, ebbs and
flows through it."
"And the finale" â I began.
"Tou find that slower," he queried,
"at the beginning?"
"And like tremendously the climax it
gives you the chance at,** I dared. "I
said so this morning in the paper" â
"You have already written?"
â¢ He did not know then! But I hesi
tated and was lost. I had to own here
that I was the impertinent person that '
had written that I thought M. d' Albert j
was out of humor with his Schumann i
"Careeval" the night before.
The pianist looked puzzled, amused, j
Interested all at once.
"What was it made you think that?" !
he asked â I found on summing up aft- j
emard that M. d'Albert's queries were ;
at least as many as mine own.
The audacious Westerner told him !
that she had felt his "Carneval" j

"But it is a 'Carnival,' " the great j

"Tes, I was." D' Albert contradicted,
! still with amused gentleness. "I am
; not much dependent on moods. That
; is the way I like the 'Carneval.' "
But he got up to walk about and
think about it. Then he came over to
my chair and looked down from his
five feet and an unimportant fraction
!to explain. It was all done with the
' delicateiv charming courtesy of the
â  truly grÂ»at man. He began, putting up
' a bandaged forefingerâ that he had
played with the night before: "In
America, you know, you have had so
many pianists of a certain type â
what in Europe we feel as the very
correct but cold school â that perhaps
my school comes strangely at first.
These pianists" â he mentioned names
that it requires little wit to supply,
"to us lack Warmth. They have no

"Tell me about the operas," I asked
then. "Of course, you like composing
better than playing?"
"Of course," D' Albert agreed, and
told me that he had played little of re
cent years and intended to play less.
j "How many operas have I written?
j Oh, nine or ten. No, that Is American."

One's first Impression upon entering
the exhibition-room is that of dullness,
quiet, serenity. The key is low, and
it possessee its psychological effect. If
you are gay, it reproves you. If you

it. If you be distraught, it calms you.

it's not an essential duty of art, so 'tis
said, to promote hilarity. Alas! Alas!

As to the individual pictures, there is
much to be said. But much would I
prefer that you should see them â you
who love the beautiful â and create

" 'The Low lands'?" I asked; "not

"You knov. that play?" the pianist
asked In turn. His surprise was not
wholly complimentary to us.
"Yes," I returned glibly; "we have
had it here, of course, and it was gen
erally remarked that it would make a
splendid opera. But we thought of Mr.
Wagnerâ Mannelich Is such an ex
tremely Siegfriedy sort of person."
"It is very funny that you know
that." Iff. d'Albert repeated.
I reminded him that it was seventeen
years since he had been to San Fran
cisco, then asked how he had treated
the story.
He laughed and hesitated before he
replied. "Realistic, I suppose one
might call the treatment, though not
in the 'Cavalleria' fashion. It Is diffi

ception, in my poor opinion â "Tha

See, by all means, "Monterey Bay,"
one of the largest, if not the largest,
canvas shown. Largeness Is not, how

Its view (the obtruding things forgot).
Its splendid sweep of turquoise bay, its
dun, sandy rim, its 'dobe habitat o'er

\as lures. Here is an exemplification
of that harmony and subtle calmness
that is so essential a part of the Ma
thtrvs exhibit.
Wholly different is "The Portfolio"â
a woman lightly reading, robed in a
luminous creamy frock, with a pair of
gleaming shoulders that make men
turn. As in "The Yellow Frock," tha
face is not fully presented, leaving in
the mind a delirious lurk of uncertain
ty. In both pictures the poses are
highly interesting, but their charm lies
in the portrayal of the luminosity or
tranelucency of the gowns. Herein lies
a triumph.

He told me then that he very much
i admired the modern Italian school "La
I Tosca," though deprecating the blood
iness of its theme. Of his own other
I operas he likes best "The Departure,"
; that is very well known in Europe.
Richard Strauss came up then â
! through his "Feursnoth" â and I asked
I D'Albert who he thought was doing
any big stuff for the piano now.
"No one," he decided. Strauss he
catalogued as a great composer of
i symphonic music, but neither gifted
! operatically nor as a composer for
piano.
I told him then that there was a good
! deal of disappointment felt locally that
; he had not included any Bach upon his
I programmes.
"To-morrow night I play Bach,"
j he said, "the Passacaglia in C minor. I
! wanted, you know, also to play the
| Waldstein sonata to-morrow night.
' But they told me that every one had
I played it. Still"â he stopped and
j smiled the gentle, elfish, ironic smile
that accompanies so much of his chat.
"Stilrâ l completed, "you think that
is perhaps all the more reason why you,
the leading exponent of Beethoven,
should play the 'Waldstein'?"
"Perhaps," he nodded.
"That M. d'Albert was amazingly
born in Glasgow, Scotland, I learned
then. But he left there when a month
old, after discovering his mistake, and
went then to London. That city he left
early, also, and has sflent most of the
time since in Germany. That he did
not need to tell me. His English is
freely and quaintly flavored with the
fatherland Deutsch.
I remembered then that even In the
rain the travelers might wish to be ex
ploring, and took my leave.
VARIED BILLS
FOR THIS WEEK
AT PLAYHOUSES
A long looked for production is that
of "The Virginian" that comes to
morrow evening to the Columbia The
"The Cypress" proved to be a favor
ite with many visitorsâ who looked
rather promising as patrons â with its
blue bay, its dull stretch of fore
ground, dominated by a splendid
cypress, in solitary vigil by the sea.
Quite the most fetching piece â on
short acquaintance â is that caHed
"An Arabesque" â highly decorative in
type and much the same in style as
the mural work recently done by the
same artist. Here again Is the texture
of the robes marvelously wrought out.
I cannot now recall any local man who
has reached the exquisite art of put
ting a texture upon canvas without the
loss of a bit of glint, coloring or de
sign.
As fcr "Summer," done in the pre
vailing low key, I must confess a small
resentment. True, Mr. Mathews may
have seen summer days like unto that
dark, brown day, but it's a libel upon
our glad, gay summers. Summer stands
for joy, sunshine, flowers, laughter, ex
uberance of spirit â so do, good Mr.
Mathews, change its name, and we'll
begin to love the picture all over again
under a name that won't Jar our 11
ater. The vogue of the book has :
been an extraordinary "one and the ;
dramatization was made by Owen
Wister himself, with contributory de- j
tall by Kirke La Shelle.
As the cowboy hero Dustin Farnum. !
who made a great hit in a somewhat j
similar role in "Arizona," achieved [
one of the strongest successes of last
season in New York. Wister puts it
that Mr. Farnum comes as near to his j
most attractive hero as it is possible j
to come. Trampas is another charac- |
ter that by all accounts is most hand- j
somely cared for by Frank Campeau. j
and the personnel of the company j
generally promises very comfortably.
There is no doubt that an enthusiastic
welcome awaits the piece.

It should not be forgotten that the

ance at the California is the other
event of the week, and a large one to
local playgoers. Miss Anglin is pecu- {
liarly dear to the local playgoer. "Dls- j
covered" here, she has ever since had (
firm grip on our affections, and with j
Henry Miller has done some of the !
worthiest drama that we have had. J
Mr. Miller does not come this time â '
he is, by the way, playing in vaude
ville in "Frederick Lemaltre." But
Miss Anglin brings as leading man an- j
other actor whose work has been very j
warmly admired here in Frank
Worthing, and her whole company j
ranks highly. The first week's bill j
will be "The Marriage of Kitty," by '
Cosmo Gordon Stuart, a comedy that !
ran for two years In London and one j
in New York. A feature of the en- j
gagement, with its delightful plays, 'â

FREMSTAD TELLS

Here is a little about Olive Fremstad,

glitter here during the Metropolitan
Grand Opera season:
Miss Fremstad. who is to appear here
in the exacting role of Kundry, the en
chantress of "Parsifal," Is by birth a
Swede, though she can also claim to
be American, for her girlhood was
spent in Minneapolis. When she was
very young â which was not many
years agoâ she sang in this country on

ment, taste and ambition, however,
predestined her to grand opera, and,
on going abroad to complete her musi
cal studies, she proceeded to Berlin,
where, under the tuition of Lilli Leh
mann, she developed the fine vocal and ,
dramatic qualities with which she haÂ»
been so generously endowed. In Ger
many she studied the chief mezzo so
prano, and some of the dramatic so- i
prano, parts in the Wagnerian reper- !
tory, adding to* them others of a quite |
different kind, like Carmen and San- â 
tueza.
Equally at home, too, is Miss Frem
stad said to be in the roles of Siegllnde
and Fricka ("Die Walkuere"), Bran
gaone r'Tristan und Isolde") and Venus
("Tannhauser"). One of her most ar- j
dent wishes has long been to realize, i
as no other singer since Galli-Marie. j
the brilliant creato-r of the part In [
Paris, has realized it, the character of |
Biaefs capricious Carmen. She sang j
the role in Germany, and with im
mense success, giving to it a color and
meaning entirely different from yet
fully as fasoinating as those lent to it
by Calve. Another of her dreams will
have been realized when she interprets
Kundry. Beautiful, as few singers now j
on the lyric stage are beautiful; ter- !
peramental and gifted with a naturally '
pure, rich and golden voice, which she
haa learned to control skillfully; an I
artist to the finger tips, dramatic to a |
degree, and yet at no time melodra- j
matlc, Olive Fremstad should be an j
ideal Kundry.
What Miss Fremstad has to say of
the character of Kundry, in which she
will alternate here with Nordica, is in
teresting.
"I know how I should like to sing
the music which Wagner has written [
for Kundry," says Miss Fremstad, "but !
how can I tell you, even if I can grasp,
all that is expressed in the character?
Years of thought â years of study â
would be needed to fathom Kundry. i
The part Is one of the most complex \
and mysterious in the whole range of !
music-drama, and it seems to me al
most presumptuous for one so new to '
it as I to attempt an analysis of it.
"Kundry, as she appears in 'Parsifal,' j
is before all else a lost soul, seeking '
forgiveness, peace and what we call j
redemption. She has sinned deeply, for '
; she has beguiled Amforta?. And for
I her sin she now suffers. The keynote
' to her character is struck, I think, in
I the very two first chords which ac
: company her entrance. They introduce
her to us as a creature infinitely sor
rowful, harrowed by remorse, and as
it were scourged by conscience. Al
! though she \s a woman, she Is not one
i woman, in the same sense as, say.
Queen Elizabeth or Lady Macbeth.
There is no doubt, I think, that Kundry
(though for dramatic purposes pre
sented as a woman) is much more than
that.
"I do not agree with thos* who as
sure us that Â»he is a stage embodiment
of the "eternal-womanly." But I do be
lieve that she Is a symbol standing for
an idea, the symbol of a force strug
gling against other forces. And in the
second act, when she appears as Kling
sor's slave, she Is an enchantress. She
existed long before the events in
'Parsifal,' for Klingsor addressee her
'as 'thou who wast Herodlas,' and in
one passage, as you know, she refers to
her meeting with the Savior whom she
laughed to scorn. She is a reincarna
tion, then (after perhaps many incar
nations) of the lost soul of Herodias.
And what may she not have been be
fore Herodias was dreamt of? In the
last act she is a penitent and finds
peace, pardon and redemption in death.

After death? That does not concern
us. All we know is that she dies.

FRITZ KREISLER,
THE VIOLINIST,
WILL BE HEARD
Possibly THE event of the musical
season â pure and simple â place
this week in the coming of Fritz Kreis
ler, violinist. If the critical atmosphere
goes for anything at all. it spells Kreis
ler. as the violinist extraordinary in
every sense. There is no flavor in it of
the slight contempt with which all the
marveling â at the glittering virtuosity
of a Kubelik was tinged. There are no
reserves of any kind. Technically.
Kreisler seems to go without saying.
Musically, he appears to satisfy every
desire. ' His range of sympathy seems
of the broadest; his repertoire is exalt
ed as it Is varied. The calloused Lon
doner, with his seventy concerts a week
to choose from, raves like a school girl
over the Kreisler tone; chops out a new
vocabulary to fit his sense of the Kreis- â¢
! ler magnetism,' and yet another to exalt
; the magnificence of his readings.
â¢' If the season has . dealt rather shab
bily with the fiddlers so far â and it has
â everything points to the fact that in
Kreisler coming they will be fully
compensated. He gives here three con
certs, on next Wednesday and Friday
evenings and at the Saturday matinee,
with a special concert at the St. Fran
| cis on Thursday evening.

Lent and the Smart Set
As yet the smart set hasn't reached
the yawning stage of Lentâ it hasn't
had time! If the fact had not been
proclaimed from the pulpits and in the
busybody press the presence of the
"penitential season" would scarce be
known. - â  ; ',*?.
Ever since the trumpeters blew their
gladsome blasts at the Mardi Gras
ball there's been something on the
cardsâ course, informal. Just what
the technical meaning of "informal" is
I am in grave doubt, although I dare
say it is yet a respectable word. But
it has been worn sadly threadbare and
shabby by its indiscriminate use, often
exchanging significance with the good
old | bucolic expression "Jolly."
However, "informal" affairs are per
mitted in Lent in all save the orthodox
families of the Catholic and Episcopal
faithsâ and even among these, many
of the younger folk are taking liberties,
such as going to theaters, to occasional
luncheons and dinners, much to the
horror of the good old school, who hold
religiously to the old customs. But on
the other hand the young women who
do these occasional things are devoting
a specific allotment of their time to
charity work, sewing for the needy,
looking after hospital beds, providing
"layettes" for babes of the tenement
district*â these are things that
count. And while helping the needy
they help the giver infinitely more.
Besides the little luncheon diversions
there are bridge parties at every turn
of the road. And in fashionable ho
tels It is said that bridge has revolu
tionized the meal hours â but isn't it
much easier for the dining-room corps '
to wait round an hour or two than to
break up a fascinating game?
O, no; there's no money in games |
in Lent. No, no, not now! Only
prizes! But, of course, prizes are
Bometimes merchantableâ that is if you
know where they're bought.
In New York the fashionable set (ex-,
eluding the Belmont-Fish-Oelrichs co- !
terie) observe Lenten regulations far J
more generally than do we by the
Western eea, largely because most of
the fashionable leaders in the East are .
themselves street observers of the sea- j
son of repentance.
However, San Francisco has made I
this social sacrifice and con- ;
cession to Lentâ there .are to be' I
no biff dances yntll after the dawn of
Eaeter. â â  there: Besides, these Len>
ten Sabbath days find bevies of devout
maidens wending their way to church, :
looking as demure as if they hadn't j
enjoyed the merriest kind of a time at 1
a tea the day before. ~ â ' --'-â 
But then it was "informal," you ;
know.

DUCHESS OF ROXBURGH K
DESIRES IKI>H HOME
Wishes to Follow the Fashion Among
the Wealthy of Great
_ -_ Britain..
LONDON, March 13.â As it is thÂ«
fashion now for wealthy people to have
a residence in Ireland, the Duke and
Duchess of Roxburghe have determined
to find an Irish home. Anticipating an
invitation from the Irish Viceroy to
spend a week with him at Dublin
Castle, the Duchess wrote a leading
Brm of house agents having offices in
Dublin and Belfast, asking for par
ticulars of any eligible mansions that
were to let in any part of Ireland, but
In the % wild picturesque west for pref
erence.
It appears that the Duchess had read
â nuch in America of the scenic beauty
of Connemara in which Kylemoro
Castle Is situated, and she mentioned
t particularly as one of the districts
where iahe would like to reside for at
east a portion of the year. There are
â nany fine mansions " In the ; , neighbor
hood, but It is feared that none of them
would come up to the requirement* of a
{feat ducal residence without exten
sive alterations.
The Duchess, of Manchester, together
with ; Lord â¢ Ardilaun and his brother
Liord Iveagh, has so popularized this
particular district that excessive rent*
ire demanded for houses that admit of
living in anything like style.
Menetik to Visit Europe.

ter to his family in Zurich. According
to the letter the Negus intends to visit
London, Paris and Rome and the Jour
ney is to be made within a few month*.
His advent is arousing deep interest in
these capitals, for he is more than a
barbarian, and his little country has
shown itself great in war, as the Ital
ians know to their cost.

mand of the Fim, with hendquarters
in San Francisco, and Colonel Robert
Wankowj-ki in command of the Sec
ond, with headquarters in Los Ange
!e?.
Now that honors are being distrib

to have a member of the guard in
.San Francisco, who has held high
rank In the org-inization. appointed
commander temporarily of the Second
Brigade, so he may be placed on the
retired list with the high-sounding
title of brigadier general. The plans
have been laid, but it remains to be
seen if the Governor will make the
appointment.
After twenty-one years service. Col
onel J. F. Burgin, for th~ last five
- adjutant of the Second Brigade,
has asked to be returned to the re

CITY OF HOPE
Fraternal Orders of Country
to Establish Vast Tuber
cular Colony in New Mexico
QIAKTERS FOR 50,000
Broad Tract of Land With
Varying Altitudes Sought
For by the Site Committee
For some time a number of the most
prominent members of the fraternal as
sociations of the United States have
been working up a plan to establish a
national fraternal sanitarium in New
M-xico for the cure of consumption.
The proposition, the greatest that has
ever be^n advanced along fraternal
lines, is to buiid a fraternal city in the
Territory named, and have as its cen
tral building and nucleus the large
Temple of riaternity that was one of
the attractive structures at the St.
Louis Exposition and cost $90,000. It
has been ilonau-d for that purpose and
will be taken down and rebuilt on thy
f-ite to be selected.
At the head of the movement is the j
president and chairman of the execu- I
live committee, W. R. ' Sidson,' presi
dent of the Associated Fraternities; of
America, representing 3,000,000 mem- j
bers. . Judge Noah M. Givan, supremo i
reporter. Knights of Honor, is the first
vice president. Charles F. Hatfield, who â 
is also secretary . of the Missouri Fra- j
ternal i 'ongrtt.-, is general secretary. â 
August SchlafJy, president of the Mis-
Eouri-IJncoln Trust Company, is treas- j
I urer of th* sanitarium. Dr. H. A. War- j
ncr ofTopeka, Kans.. second vice pres- i
ident, is an expert on consumptives.- In i
the fraternal world he is past president 'â 
of the National : Fraternal Congress, i
and supreme medical ; director of the I
Kniph*.= and l^adies of .â¢ Security. ' Dr. j
W. H. Mayfield, an expert on consump- '
tion, is president of the Mayfield Sani- i
tarium, St. Louis/ M. P. Moody,:man
ager of the American Baptist Publica
tion Society,, to whom ;> is given the '
credit of having nursed the sanitarium '
movement -when it was in its infancy, j
:is secretary of the 1 religious depart- j
ment.
. i. ihi? movement are enlisted all the !
fraternal associations of this country,
rflprc."?cnting about eight ;:.-' millions of
people. In order to start the fraternal
city, it is proposed to ask each associa
tion to contribute 1 cent per member at
.-tated periods to he determined hen-- '
attt-r. such contributions to be collected
until the new city shall be self-sustain
ing.
r CLIMATE BENEFICIAL.
I Reports pi esented show that the cli
mate of New Mexico, is such that hun
dreds of individuals with. lun^ j
troubles and consumption have not i
only been benefited, but cured. Not!
only are the fraternities moving In this, i
but many of the churches â¢of various >
- dKr.utnir.atioif^ will take part, as will {
i>iso States, municipalities/unions and j
clubs. "..I-*" -""J r- .- ,\ i , â - I
. In many respects this fraternal city 1
will lie the most unique community in i
the United J States. It will : be an enor

_ Twenty cities in New Mexico are bid- J
"ding tor j the sanitarium. : Their offers J
'vary from 4.000 to 100.000 -acre tracts, j
The Influence of two rival railroads is ;
being pushed to the limit to secure fa
voraole considerations. v Une prominent
raihuad official has i pledged Â»iOu.oou in
cash and land if the sanitarium be lo- ,
cated anywhere along his line. J
With the magnitude ot the sanitari- '
urn thus outlined, and the. terrors- well- â .
known of the . "great white plague," i
-which it is to fight, it can be seen tndt
the fraternalists: of the country have
undertaken the- most gigantic cam
paign i yet waged against consumption. â¢
; Plans are being formed with the. ex
pectation of caring for 50,000 consump
tive patients at -the sanitarium. - With .
II the land at its command, there is prac- ;
tically ;no limit : to :. the } number of pa- !
tients who will be welcomed to the fra- !
ternal city from 1 the cities and towns
of the Middle West, South and con- ,
gested East.
Each patient at the sanitarium will ;
be the . guest of the fraternal order, the
church, the club, the union, the city,
or the state which shall contribute to
the maintenance of the institution.
. The I leaders of the Associated Frater
nities of America and the National Fra
'â â  ternal Congress, representing ; 8,000,000
fraternalists of the : country, :- have
pledged their support \to : the levying of
a 1 cent per month per capita tax.
; OXE CENT PEK : MEMBER.
This' will give the sanitarium a work
ing endowment of not less ; ; - : than
$500,0005 a year from â¢ the fraternalists
al one. â  The .Ancient Order <of ' United
Workmen: of Kansas has been the first
- to demonstrate that the ; plan ;of , assess
ment is not a dream.; Its grand lodge
voted on March 1 to tax its 37,000 mem
bers one cent each. â '.'; '
j |In 'â '; return ; for such contributions the
â  organizations will be permitted to send
to the sanitarium as many patients as
i their ; monthly tax will support. For
instance, an order, a ; city ' or an , mdi!
! vidual:, may contribute $500 a ' month.
The cost per patient would be, say 550.
The contributor, therefore, would be
entitled :to maintain ten patients at the
sanitarium per month. ; â ItÂ»is ,* under

Jt seemed as though the carnage of that struggle, its settlement of
great national issues thai had long been pending, and its working
nal hatreds that had long smoldered, inclined men to
turn away from it all and give attention to the great issues of life.
od it then was the clement of sorrow, caused in thousands of

consolation elsewhere than in the physical and political results that
were ac - cd.
It was well that the people, North and South, who had so long
the god of battles, should turn their faces and their hopes
10 the god of mercy. In that time they sought the sanctuary, lis
tened to the exhortations of the preacher, prostrated themselves be

The movement follows the law that seems to have been in all

has added to the flood of impressions and impulses that make
men solemn in their reflections upon the fleeting nature of human

Under such circumstances there is a tendency to shut out the
world with its strife and its battles, its ambitions and its work, which
suffer or enjoy for so bfief a space, and turn to what is un
seen and unknown, but concerns a future for which all hope, in which
the losses of this world will be turned to gains, its sorrows into joy
and its toil into rest. One may well overlook what seems merely
spectacular in these religious revivals, and can well credit what may
be mere emotion with the good purpose which it serves. All men do

AMERICAN ART.
A MOST welcome recognition has just been given to our art, to
â rtxsts, to such of our industries as are artistic in their
re. and to our general love of and confidence in our coun

ral di Cesnola as director of the Metropolitan Museum
York.
nage point of his position the new director expects
â¢â¢ in America, and a part of his method will be to g ; .vt
greater confidence in themselves â a confidence not only
of the artists to go forward in producing good work,
ilie to depend upon Oiir home artists to execute great
;-.id of foreign finish. He says there is no reason
uni in New York should not be one of the greatest in
: that we have the resources, our own artists, and an art
of His only adverse criticism, the one place where he
mentions failure, contains even in the word "fail" a word of en
conn , Sir Caspar says that we fail to recognize our own
genius.
The chief thought in all this is that we have an art of our very
own : that going to England and to Europe for finish, for the seal
of the approval of judgments other than our own, is no longer
needed. In ail art and in all professions the period of imitation and
of learning from authority is merely the apprenticeship stage. When
the pupil becomes a master his work must be his own â have indi
viduality and be free. Sir Caspar Clarke virtually says that America
has passed its apprenticeship, and our art should be our own â al
â¢:r own, could we but recognize it and have confidence in it.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 19. 1905.
INAUGURATION
WEEK
TROY ALLISON
PENNSYLVANIA avenue was
gay with flying flags and bunt
insr. The crowd on the pave
ments, kept from overflowing
the curbstone by the force of
mounted police, was larger than the
city had seen in years.
On the corner of Twelfth and the
avenue the people who had been un
able to decide whether they preferred
sc?mÂ»' tfefi mar of the Hour start from
the White House or arrive at the Cap
itol had finally formed a congested mob
that concluded to let well enough alone
and save the wear and tear of further
progress.
A group of cowboys in their best
Western finery- joked a crowd of girls
that had turned out to see the proces
sion. Two Indians, decorated with
every specimen of button, badge and
feather, stood with stolid patience just
where the crowd â was thickest.
A man in a light overcoat towered
head and shoulders above the rest. A
newsboy reached up with a variegated
cane and tilted his derby rakishly to
one fide. "Wisht 1 was up in the
clouds with you, mister," he grinned.
"I could review this percession to bet
ter advantage."
"I might as well be stone blind,"
came a plaintive voice whose owner's
diminutive stature was wedged in be
tween the Indians and the man with
the light coat, 'and 1 reckon I'd be
rather more comfortable if I were
stone dead at the same time."
Sedley looked down from his height
of six feet three with a smile at the
humor of th? situation. "It's too
bad," he said pityingly; "push back
this way a little â I can elbow the
crowd at the side a bit â might be
dangerous to push forward into those
Indians â don't think I ever saw any
more decorated specimens â they may
havys tomahawks in every pocket for
all you know."
The girl laughed and moved tward
him. "I don't mind them.' She show
ed a row of white teeth and black
eyes pparkling with excitement. "I'm
so dark and small and black-haired
that that newsboy with the cane asked
me if I was the squaw that belonged
to the Indian gentleman!"
Sedley had already recognized her
voice as belonging to a daughter of
the far South, and when she turned
her face toward him her Creole an
cestry was a certainty.
"I have lost my crowd. I tried to
take a little walk by myself before
it was time to start for the grand
stand," she said with frank friendli
ness, "and I have lost my hotel. I
don't know where anything on earth
is except Just me." Her sentence end
ed with a little gasp as the crowd
made a sudden impulse forward.
"And I'm afraid among your other
losses you are going to lose your
view of the President," said Sedley,
trying to keep the crowd from jost
ling her. "How much can you see
from down there?"
"Oh, I can't see anything but two
buckskin jacket?. They may be very
niceâ in the buckskin line â but I
want to see the President. I never saw
a real live President in my life," dole
fully.
"He's almost here," he said. "I won
der if â cr â you would let me â cr â lift
you up so you could see him?" he sug
gested with a touch of good-natured
shyness.
"Oh, would you?" she exclaimed with
j the volume of gratitude of one who has
been granted a heart's desire. "I weigh
a hundred and one. Do you think you
could hold me till he passed?" anxi
ously.
"Just try me," he said smiling, as he
lifted her until she beamed happily over
the two greased heads in front of them.
The President, in acknowledging the
' cheers that burst forth, gave a purely
personal smile of amusement and good
win to a girl whose sparkling face
rose clear above the mass, and who, in
her excitement, snatched a derby hat
and waved it enthusiastically.
"Did you see him smile at me?" she
! asked breathlessly, when her feet
i touched the pavement.
"1 don't see how he could help it."
; Sedley took her arm and drew her to
I one side, as the people hurried on to
ward the Capitol. "If you will give
mt some information on the subject, I
j will see if I can help you find that lost
hotel."
"You are just as good as can be,"
she said gratefully. "It's the Willard,
and I know papa is frantic about me
by this time."
"The Willard? That's easy." And
Sedlcy's conscience justified the
"around your elbow to get your thumb"
route which he took to the hotel, by
the theory that it was easier to walk
six blocks through practically empty
streets than to walk two against a
surging mob.
When they reached the hotel he took
his leave reluctantly. "I wonder if It
the work of the malice of individuals, but are the result of the plans
of big, patriotic, secret societies, organized to obtain Russian free
dom, and the killings are not done indiscriminately Because of the
victims' greatness, but their selection and the order of their taking
off are all parts of a connected scheme, and further deaths will follow
if they are needed, even to that of the Czar.
It remains to be seen whether the reforms promised by Nicholas
will pacify those great societies which are revolutionarily inclined, or
whether the disasters txvhis armies and his evident alarm for his
throne may not tempt them to larger demands. The rescript does
not promise that the people may legislate, but only that they may
"participate in the elaboration and consideration of legislative meas
ures," and, of course, thife could be made but an ineffective promise.
No doubt it would be well for the revolutionists to wait and test the
sincerity of the Czar, for. even granting the Russian people are fit
for self-government, a period of participation in the "elaboration and
consideration of legislative measures" would give them the power to
more effectually use a later grant, or seizure, of full freedom in law
making. '

"I don't think it wouldâ very." There
was amusement in her eyes. "Papa
would probably like to thank you for

THE SOLILOQUY
OF EMPEROR OF
THE RUSSIANS
(Extracts from Mark Twain's article
in the North American Review.)
AFTER the Czar's morning bath
it is his habit to mediate an hour
before dressing himself. â Lon
don Times Correspondence.
[Viewing himself in the pier
glass. 1
Naked, what am I? A lank, skin
ny, spider-legged libel on the image of
God! Look at the waxwork head â
the face, with the expression of a
melon â the projecting ears â the knot
ted elbowsâ the dished breast â the
knife-edged shins â and then .the feet,
all beads and joints and bone-sprays,
an imitation X-ray photograph! There
is nothing imperial about this, noth
ing imposing, inipressive, nothing to
invoke awe v and reference. Is
it this that 140,000,000 Russians kiss
the dust before and worship? Mani
festly not! No one could worship this
spectacle, which is Me. Then who is
it, what is it, that they worship? Pri
vately, none knows better than I. It
is my clothes. Without by clothes 1
should be as destitute of authority as
any other naked person. Nobody could
tell me from a parson, a barber, a
dude. Then who is the real Emperor
of Russia? My clothes. There is no
other.
Titles â another artificiality â are a
part of his clothing. They and the dry
goods conceal the wearer's inferiority
and make him seem great and a won
der, when at bottom there is nothing
remarkable about him. They can move
a nation to fall on its knees and sin
cerely worship an Emperor who with
out the clothes and the title would
drop to the rank of the cobbler and be
swallowed up and lost sight of in the
massed multitude of the inconsequen
tials; an Emperor who, naked in a
naked world, would get no notice, ex
cite no remark, and be heedlessly
shouldered and jostled like any other
uncertified stranger, and perhaps of
fered a kopek to carry somebody's
gripsack; yet an Emperor who. by the
sheer might of those artificialtiesâ
clothes and a title â can get himself
worshiped as a deity by his people, and
at his pleasure and unrebuked can ex
ile them, hunt them, harry them, de
stroy them, just as he would with so
many rats if the accident of birth had
furnished him a calling better suited
to his capacities than empering.
'After a silence.) A curious inven
tion, an unaccountable inventionâ the
human race! The swarming Russian
millions have for centuries meekly al
lowed our Family to rob them, insult
them, trample them under foot, while
they lived and suffered and died with
no purpose and no function but to make
that Family comfortable! These peo
ple are horses â Just that â horses with
clothes and a religion. A horse with
the strength of a hundred men will let
one man beat him, starve him, drive
him: the Russian millions allow a mere
handful of soldiers to hold them in
slaveryâ and these very soldiers are
their own sons and brothers!
Laws are merely restraints â they
have no other function. In civilized
countries they restrain all persons,
and restrain them all alike, which is
fair and righteous; but In Russia such
laws as exist make an exception â our
Family. We do as we please; we
have done as we pleased for centuries.
Our common trade has been crime,
our common pastime murder, our
common beverage blood â the blood of
the nation. Upon our heads lie mil
lions of murders. Yet the pious mor
alist says it is a crime to assassinate
us. We and our uncles are a family
of cobras set over 140,000,000 rabbits,
whom we torture and murder and
feed upon all our days; yet the mor
alist urges that to kill us is a crime,
not a duty.

There are 25,000,000 families in Russia.
There is a man-child at every mother's
knee. If these were 25,000,000 patriotic
mothers they would teach these man
children daily, saying: "Remember
this, take it to heart, live by it, die for
it if necessary; that our patriotism is
mediaeval, outworn, obsolete; that the
modern patriotism, the true patriotism,
the only rational patriotism, is loyalty
to the nation all the time, loyalty to
the Government when It deserves it."
With 25,000,000 taught and trained
patriots in the land a generation from
now my successor would think twice
bÂ«fore he would butcher a thousand
helpless poor petitioners humbly beg
ging for his kindness and justice, as I
did the other day.
(Reflective pause.) Well, perhaps I
have been affected by these depressing
newspaper clippings which I found un
der my pillow. I will read and ponder
them again.
THE ROSE-COLORED GLASS
Once, when a child. I found somewhere
A piece of clear rÂ«d glass,
And when I looked through it, it brought
A miracle to pass:
The dull old earth and clouded sky
Became most wondrous bright.
And tree and flower and everything
Rejoiced in rosy light.
â 
And through the years of later life
Some happy folk I've known
Who'd found the magic of the giasa
And made it all their own;
Some happy folk for whom the sun
Still shone on cloudy days.
For whom the flowers would always
spring
Along the stony ways;
Brave-hearted folk who yet could smile I
When troubles closely crept.
Who ever had a word of cheer
For those who sighed or wept;
Dear folk whom it was good to know,
Whoinade the dull grow bright.
And shed about their way on earth
A rosy heavenly light.
And oft I think how good a time
'Twould surely bring to pass,
If all of us could look on life
Through their rose-colored glass!

Is this asking too much of one wo
man? Many seem to think so. A cer
tain newspaper writer has been hard at
; work for several weeks making the
stream of public opinion on the mar
riage question a little thicker by stir
! ring up its murky depths. She has
j done all kinds of mischief, and â may
; she be forgivenâ she has done it in the j
name of common sense.
When you hit a man in the eye with !
a pith ball you don't make him see. j
You make him wink, and weep, and I
squint, and get him ready for the doc- j
tor. And womankind is no better for J
j being taught that she has grievances
which by herself she would never have
found out that she possessed.
Let well enough alone, unless you can
make it better. Why should one teach
wives that their husbands are tyrants?
Why should one teach husbands that !
their wives are fools? This is just ex
actly what you do when you hold up to
ridicule or scorn the exasperating fol
; lies and the hopeless sins of either
class. Let bad enough alone unless you
can hope to make it better.
In general, married people get along
pretty well together. They live up to
the truth which Longfellow puts in Hi- I
awatha's lips, even though it never oc- '
curs to them to say it either in prose* """**
or poetry. They try not only to do their best day by day. but also to get
an idea how they may do still a little better.
I am not sorry for the women who help their husbands in quiet, homely
ways, who are always ready to look on the bright side of things, and to put
j the best foot forward. They do not need my pity. Ido not believe that their
husbands fail to appreciate their service. The average man is never sorrier
, than when his wife has to work beyond her strength. And many a plain
woman who, through doing her blessed duty as wife and mother, has grown
old in what the cynical world chooses to call "the harness" of married life,
: remains, though youth and bloom have fled, the starlight, moonlight, firelight.
sunlight of the home of which she is the creator.
CHAMPION WRANGLERS
Man and Wife Have Quarreled > 1 10 Times in Four
teen Years and Are Ready for More Spats.
JOHN MADGETT and his wife
have quarreled 5110 times, and
they are proud of it. They are in
the prime of middle life, and ad
mit that they may quarrel 5110
times more before death parts them,
says the Chicago Tribune.
Madgett and his wife were married
in Germany fourteen years ago last
New Year's day, and six years aeo
emigrated to this country, settling: on
a farm near Augusta, Ga. They auar
reled on the day they were married.
They quarreled on the day they sailed
for America. All their week days, all
their Sundays, all their holidays have
been marked by quarrels.
John Madgett is a methodical man.
and for fourteen years he has kept a
dally record of the quarrels he has had
with his "haus frau." The book, with
its old-fashioned blue paper \eaves. is a
curiosity, probably without an eaual In
the United States.
A friend who has made a careful
study of John Madgett's "book of quar
rels" has compiled the following tabu
lated statement, showing the extent,
variety and nature of the disputes of
the house of Madgett:
Because she refused to promise to
obey in the marriage service 1
Because the pump froze
Because the black hen's leg was
broken 1
Because he tracked in mud on the
kitchen floor 821

WAR INSURANCE
CAUSE OF SUIT
Shipping Firm Seeks to Re
cover Value of Contra
band Seized by Russians
CAPTUKE'OF THE ARABIA
German Steamship's Seizure
by Vladivostok Squadron
Is the Cause of Action
Balfour, Guthrie & Co. have brought
suit against the St. Paul Fire and Ma
rine ; Insurance Company for the T re
covery of $6000 insurance money, to-,
gether with interest and costs of ac
tion, alleged to be . due as a result of
the seizure of the steamship Arabia by
the Russian Vladivostok squadron last
July. The shiping firm claims that in
surance is due on 7000 sacks of flour
billed for Kobe and Nagasaki, which
arrived at Vladivostok. The complaint
was filed by Frank & Mansfield, attor
neys for Balfour, Guthrie & Co., in the
United States Circuit Court and the
insurance company has entered a de
murrer. :Â»
The Arabia, fomerly a Hamburg-
American line vessel, was chartered for
. three years by the American Trading
: Company, which is affiliated with : the
i Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company, a Harriman line. She last
left Portland July 3, 1904, bound for
Nagasaki and Kobe. ' "
In her cargo ,she carried railway
and bridge material and a large ship
ment of flour, all: of which is contra
band" when billed to ports of belliger
ents. Balfour, Guthrie | & Co. > had on
board 5000 sacks of ! flour, valued at
$4350. bound Kobe, and 2000 sacks,
valued at $1750, boUnd for Nagasaki.
While the vessel was on the high
seas the commission company applied
to the St. Paul concern fpr war risk
insurance and took out' a policy for
$6000. Shortly, thereafter word came
that the Arabia had been seized. Bal
four, Guthrie & Co., made a claim for
the insurance, ' which ' was denied on
the ground that the vessel was insured
after the seizure took place.
On Friday, July 22, when the Arabia;:
under command of J Captain Bahle,
with a crew of ten Germans and twen
ty-seven Chinese, was 140 miles from
â Yokohama, she was sighted by the
Russian cruiser Gromoboi â  and com-,
pelled to heave to. Her papers were
examined, the contraband discovered
and Lieutenant Vladislale and a: prize
crew of forty-two men took her to
Saghalien and thence to Vladivostok.
In the squadron with the Gromoboi
were the cruisers Rurik and Rosia,
subsequently . sunk â¢ by - Kamimura's
squadron. . : -- . -.' , â¢
The Arabia lay. in Vladivostok har
bor twenty-eight days before released.
She could not be held longer because
less than half her cargo was contra
band. On August 2 the prize; court
condemned and seized the railway ma
terials and flour. â¢ Ninety flatcars that
were part of the cargo were uncere
moniously dumped overboard .by the
Russians at the time of the seizure and
when the Arabia was released they'

MAESTRETTI SAYS MEN
ARE NOT PAID ENOUGH
Cashier Donahue's Salary Is to Be
Raised if Funds Are
Available.
Commissioner of Works Maestretti
yesterday defended the recent In
creases in salaries of employes In the
Engineer's office and the main office.
Maestretti said that two assistant
engineers, F. C. Hermann and W. C.
Pidge, whose salaries were raised to
$200 per month, had severed their
connection with the city government
because they had secured more ad
vantageous positions. The salaries of
5200 and $150 paid respectively to
bookkeepers are no higher than those
paid to first class men in business
houses, the increased work incident*to
the positions warranting the increase,
Maestretti says.
Maestretti called attention to the
fact that the business of the cashier's
office had increased to 6uch an extent
that the estimated revenue from fees
for 1904-1906 will aggregate $200,000,
an increase of $120,000 over 1901-1902.
Maeetrettl declares that Cashier Don
ahue is entitled to an increase in sal
ary and if funds are available he will
get it.
Sewer Men Under Civil Service.
The Civil Service Commission yes
terday certified the names of forty
four sewer men from the eligible list
compiled as the result of the recent
examination held for the positions.
The men are already employed by the
Board of Works, but will now be un
der civil service. Eight sewer men
who failed to pass the examination
will lose their positions. There are
now thirty-three men on the eligible
list, seventy-seven in all having passed
the examination.
Robber Is Sentenced.
Charles Henry, convicted of chargres
of robbery and assault to rob, was
sentenced by Judge Lawlor yesterday
to serve fourteen years in 'Folsom
penitentiary on each charge, the sen
tences to run concurrently. Henry
held ud and robbed Walter Glunz of

STRANGER KILL.S HIMSELF"
BY IXHALIXG GAS
Englishmau Believed to Be P. Jones
Deliberately Ends His Lire, Evi
dently In a Despondent ..Fit.
An Englishman or Australian,
whose name is believed to be P. J.onea,
killed himself last Friday night in his
room at 203 Powell street. His dead
body was found yesterday in bed. Il
luminating gas was escaping from two
burners, the valves of which were
fully open. The windows were closed
down tightly and the keyhole was
plugged with a piece of cloth. Only
$1 was found in the dead man's pock
ets. A label on the clothing showed
that it had been made by 'Taber &
Wertheimer," place not stated. On
the inside hatband were the initials
"P. J.," and marked with a pen in
indelible ink on the collar band of his
shirt was the name "P. Jones."
The man engaged the room on
March 4, paying a week's rent In ad
vance and registering aa W. H. Wheel
er. On the 11th he paid another
week's rent In advance. He spoke
with a strong English accent and was
believed to be an Englishman or Aus
tralian.
Mine Is Recovered.
The Supreme Court decided yester
day that H. Duvergey must reconvey
$150,000 worth of mining property to
the estate of Robert Woodburn. The
deceased was weak mentally during
the last months of his life and while
in an incompetent condition sold the
valuable mine for $25,000. Suit for
recovery of the property was com
menced previous to Woodburn's death
and was continued by the administra
tors of the estate. Duvergey claimed
that the two certificates of deposit
with which the sale price was paid
must be returned to him, and as these
could not be found it was argued that
the property must remain in his
hands. The court ridicules this con
tention..
Must Modify Plans for Wharf.
The Supreme Court says that the
city of Vallejo may construct a wharf
from Viriginia street into Mare Isl
and straits, provided that the Val
lejo Ferry Company's interests suf
fer no damage as a result. As orig
inally planned, the wharf would have
Interfered with the corporati6n's en
joyment of its franchise. The suit was
commenced in 1897, but was Hot
brought to the Supreme Court until
last year.

C. B. Fiodberg Sues to Recover Pos-
M-ssion of a Market-Street
lAHlglng:-IlouÂ«*Â».
Mabel Melvin, J. B. McMillan. E. H.
Hinkley and one John Doe Daniels,
dealers in lodging-houses, have been
charged with conspiracy to defraud by
C. H. Flodberg. former proprietor of a
house at 1032 Market street. Flod
berg filed suit against them yesterday
to recover possession of the lodging
house and $1000 damages.
Flodberg alleges that the defend
ants named came to him and informed
him that Miss Melvin had a farm
worth $1500 nine miles from Kelsey
ville, Lake County, the same having
a modern five- room cottage erected
thereon and the only incumbrance on
the property being a mortgage for
S36ti. â  Upon these representations,
Flodberg says, he traded his lodging
house for the property. When he
found the farm, however, he says it
was more than nine miles from Kel
aeyville, there was no house upon it
and it was not worth the face of the
small mortgage upon It.
He asks that the defendants be
compelled to return his lodging
house to him and that in addition he
be given ludgment against them for
$1000 damages for the trouble and
annoyance they have put him to.
Burglars Still Working.
Marian Barulich, saloon-keeper.
Seventh and Bryant streets, reported
to the police yesterday that his saloon
had been entered during the night and
$5 stolen from the cash register. S.
M. Tate reported that his room at 1030
Post street had been entered and a
dress suit case containing clothing of
the value of $97 stolen. Henry Witt,
grocer, 3151 Twenty-third street, re
ported that an attempt had been made
during the night to enXer his store by
boring a hole in the Year door, near
the lock.

Doe of the St. Nicholas Hotel on a
charge of violating the fire ordinance.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1005
WILL EXHIBIT
WORK OF HANDS
Four Technical Schools of
State Agree to Assist
at Portland's Big Show
THIS CITY LEADS WAY
Two of the Institutions to
Take Part Are Situated
Within San Francisco
Technical education as exemplified in
California will figure more strongly in
the coming exposition at Portland than
it ever has before at an exhibition.
This announcement is made by Rob
ert Furlong, who is preparing the Cali
fornia educational matter for the BhoW,
Four institutions particularly will be
represented extensively. These are the
California School of Mechanical Arto,
otherwise known as the Lick School
and the Wilmerding School, in this city,
the Throop Polytechnic Institute at
Pasadena and the State's Technical
School at San Luis Obispo.
Principal Merrill, who has charge of
the first two institutions herein men
tioned, has promised that there shall
be no lack of show material from the
San Francisco schools that he repre
sents.
Assurances have been received from
the Throop Institute and from the
technical school at San Luis Obispo.
The bulk of technical school exhibits
will probably equal the collective show
that will be made by the departments
of the University of California, which
will be displayed at Portland, having
been returned intact from the St. Louis
exposition.
The handiwork, of California boys
that can be exhibited as representa

dynamos, steam engines; and many
other evidences of skill that are small

wherever the California, school exhibits
have been displayed the principal lack
has been in the technical school work.
That lack will not be in evidence at
Portland.
NEW FASHION SET
IN LONDON" WEDDING
I-ady Ethel Keith -Falconer Has Her
Bridesmaids DreÂ«s in Different
Manner.
LONDON. March 18â Except that it |
is considered eminently the "correct
thing." nobody has ever given a good
reason why bridesmaids should always
be dressed alike. Departure from an
established custom which has nothing .
more than this to recommend it is al- ,
ways something to rejoice over.
Lady Ethel Keith-Falconer has had !
the courage to set traditions at defl- i
ance. The dresses worn by the eight j
bridesmaids at her wedding the other
day have set an entirely new fashion, \
and in future we may expect to see as
many colors as graced Joseph's coat |
when a bridal procession goes up the
aisle. The thing may have been done
before, but never at a wedding of suf :
ficient importance to figure among the
chronicles of society.
It would be difficult to improve on !
the beauty and picturesqueness of the
picture presentedâ the graceful and
self-possessed bride in her gown of
white satin, trimmed with Brussels
lace that had draped the wedding
dress of her paternal grandmother: the
two pretty pages, in cavalier suits of
white satin and silver; and the eight
bridesmaids, two in pink, two in white,
two in pale blue and two in pale green.
If i>nly there had been red-coated
guardsmen to line the aisle the pageant
would have been perfect. But the
bridegroom, John Bair, has never been
in any service more ornamental than
the diplomatic. He is the eldest son
of Sir Alexander Bair of Uric, and
some day will inherit a fortune and a
fine country house.
Lady Ethel is the daughter of Lord
Kintore, who was at one time Governor
of South Australia and as a sportsman
ranks as one of the best shots in Scot
land.
VTSCOI XT MAIiDEX MAY
WEI) AX AMERICAN" GIRL,
Saul to Have Proposed to a Debutante
Now on the Conti
nent.
LONDON, March 18.â It would sur
prise no one in society if Viscount
Maiden, the son and heir of the Earl of
Essex by his first marriage, should wed
an American girl. His stepmother is
naturally very partial to her fellow
countrywomen and entertained several
of them at the Earl's family seat in
Hertfordshire last summer. It is whis
pered that the young nobleman be
came interested in a pretty debutante
now somewhere on the Continent â and
it rests with her to decide whether she
shall some day become the future
Countess of Essex.
The Viscount, who has just come of
age, was only 9 years old when Lord
Essex installed his American bride at
Cassiobury. Under her careful train
ing he has developed into quite a model
young man, with aspirations to make
something of himself that will count
for quite as much as the title he will
some day inherit. He -is a more fre
quent visitor to the library of the
British Museum than to the West. End
music halls and saloons where youth
ful aristocrats are wont to take their
fling.
He is devoted to his clever step
mother, and his father, having profited
greatly by her influence, which has in
duced him to go in seriously for a po
litical career, has been more than
willing to surrender -his son's guidance
entirely to her hahds.

OVEKJB L LES OBJECTION
Indians From Utah Told
They Will Have to Adjust
Themselves to Inevitable
WASHINGTON, March 18. â Francis
E. Leupp, Commissioner of Indian Af
1 fairs, to-day presented" to the President
i a delegation of Ute Indians from the
j L'intah Reservation in Utah. The In
' dians came to Washington to protest
against the opening of their reserva
tion, as provided by a recent act of
Congress.
â  In a brief address to the Indians the
President informed them that the
reservation would have to be opened
and that they must adjust themselves
to the inevitable and get along amic
ably with the white settlers who might
become their neighbors. He assured
them that every right they possessed
would be protected fully.
Appa, one of the White River Utes,
replied to the President and for him
self requested that he be permitted to
be located in some forest reserve or
in some other place as far removed
as possible from the white settlers.
This request, the President said, he
was unable to errant.
The reservation will be opened prior
to September next, but no date has ,
been set. The Indians will be per
mitted to settle their own allotments.
Each head of a family is to be given
eighty acres and each single Indian
forty acres. Certain lands of the
reservation will be set aside for a for
est reserve and for agency purposes.
The remainder of the reservation after
the allotments have been made to the
Indians will be sold to settlers, /the
proceeds being deposited in the United
States Treasury to the credit of the In
dians.

Dangerous
Dandruff
There is no denying the
fact that dandruff is
dangerous â to the life and
vitality of the hair. It is
the outward manifestation
of an unhealthy condition
of the scalp, and if
neglected will surely result
in the loss of the hair, the
appearance of premature
old age and ultimate
baldness. Coke Dandruff
Cure not only quickly
fembv.es every trace of
dandruff from the scalp,
but positively prevents its
recurrence. It is a
delightfully refreshing
tonic, without a trace of
sulphur or any injurious
ingredients, and when
faithfully used has proved
its ability over and over
again to produce a heavy,
luxuriant growth of hair
where all other remedies
and formulas have failed.
Thin, brittle and poor hair,
therefore, need no longer
be a source of mortification
to any one. What Coke
Dandruff Cdre has done
for thousands it can and
will do for you. Your
druggist will tell you the '---â 
same story. Get a bottle
to-day and try it.

DRIVEWAY ON BEACH
Discrimination Against Lo
cal Manufacturers of Boil
ers Is Not Permitted
The Board of Public Works yester-
day recommended to the Supervisors
that the northerly half of H street be- I
tween Twentieth and Twenty-ninth av
enues and between Forty-fifth avenue
and the Great Highway be graded, curb- I
ed, macadamized and sidewalks be erÂ«ct- \
ed thereon. The expense of the work i
will amount to $15,000, which will be I
borne by the city, as that side of the '
street adjoins Golden Gate Park. The \
property owners will be directed to im- \
prove the southerly half of the street, i
it was at first intended to bituminize I
the street, but City Engineer Wood- :
ward reported that the assessed valu- !
ation of the property affected was not i
high enough to permit legally of ai
more expensive pavement.
The board awarded the contract for
the keeping in repair of bituminous
pavements on Market. Folsom, Front
and California streets and Golden Gate
avenue until June 30 to the City Street
Improvement Company for $5997. Two
other awards to repair bituminous
pavements in various parts of the city .
were postponed until next Wednesday.
R. L. Fulda addressed the board in
behalf of a petition of property owners !
that Fulton street between Forty-sev- I
enth and Forty-ninth avenues, between
Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth ave
nues and between Thirty-first and
Thirty-second avenues be repaved.
The board will meet the property own- .
ers next Monday at 2 p. m. at Spreckela
Lake to discuss the matter.
REPAIRING CALIFORNIA STREET. â 
Deputy Donovan was instructed to
report on the petition of the Crocker
estate that California street between
Mason and Jones be repaved.
The building at 1513 Leavenworth
street was ordered vacated and torn
down on the report of a building in
spector that it is likely to fall in at
any moment.
The petition of Mrs. Muirhead that '
she be permitted to build a store at 7
Larkin street in the Mechanics' Pa
vilion was denied. A similar petition
filed by the Mechanics' Institute was
denied some time ago. The store
would form part of what is now used
as an exit and stairway and the board |
intends to order the exit reopened for j
the purpose for which it was originally
intended.
Deputy Donovan was directed to re
port on the application of the San 1
Francisco Gas Company to install eight
poles in different parts of the city.
Designs of the poles must be submitted
before any permit will be granted.
The board granted W. C. Pidge. an
assistant engineer, a six months'
leave of absence.
A representative of a machine com
pany urged the board to postpone the
time for the receiving of bids for boil
err for the oil \ 'ant in the Hall of Jus
tice. ~Te said the time was too short
to permit of Eastern concerns filing
bids, which would be at least 25 per
cent less than for boilers of local pro
duction. The board refused to change
the time for receiving bids, as it de
sires to favor home manufacture
whenever possible.
NEW BEACH DRIVEWAY.
Commissioner Aigeltinger will hold
a consultation with Park Commis
sioner Spreokels to-morrow at 11
o'clock in the Mayor's ofÃce. The ob
ject of the conference is to take steps
to utilize the rock to be blasted along
the Cliff House road to build a drive
way on the beach parallel with the
Great Highway. The Park Commis
sioners are willing to pay 25 cents per
cubic yard to help pay the expense of
removing the rock instead of having it
dumped into the ocean. Bids have
been received for blasting and the con
tract will be awarded next week.
Commissioner Aigeltinger said the
$5000 available from the funds for re
pairs to bituminous pavements made
possible by the settlement with the
Yorke Company could not be utilized
to bituminize Marshall Sqaure. The
money for the improvement, however,
has been provided for in the bond
issue. .

QUARREL DISTURBS
HARMONY OF BARRACKS
Surgeons and Commanding Officer
at Plattsburg, X. V., Involved In
Altercation.
PLATTSBURG, March 18. â Whoop
ing cough broke out a month or so
ago in the family of Captain William
F. Martin at the barracks here and
Captain Martin employed a local phy
sician instead of calling in Major
â Woodruff, the post surgeon, or Lieu
tenant Woodbury, assistant surgeon at
the post. Major Woodruff then or
dered Captain Martin's' family quar
antined, although it is stated that in
similar cases of whooping cough in
other officers' families at the post Major
Woodruff did not order the quaran
tine. When the matter was brought
to the attention of Colonel Adams, he,
after an investigation, ordered Cap
tain Martin's family released from
quarantine.
It is charged that thereupon Major
"Woodruff sent a report direct to the
War Department regarding the condi
tion of Colonel Adams' health and
other matters of a personal nature.
Colonel Adams' friends among the
officers of the regiment allege that the
report was not only sent direct to the
War Department instead of through
the regular channels, which they say
is a sross breach of army regulations,
but also that the report itself was in
accurate and that it does an injustice

WARNER ELECTED
TO THE SENA TE.
Uproarious End
ing of Missouri
Deadlock.
Democrats Fail
to Prevent a
Final Vote,
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.. March IS.â
After having been in deadlock since
January If- over the election of a Unit
ed States Senator to succeed Senator
Cockrell. the Legislature, at fifteen
minutes before sine die adjournment
to-day, elected Major William Warner,
Republican, of Kansas City, to fill the
vacancy.
Seven ballots in joint session were
taken to-day in effecting a decision
and the closing scenes of the Legisla
ture have not been paralleled in the
history of Missouri politics. When it
became evident that Warner would be
the choice, the Democrats, who had
steadfastly supported " Cockrell
throughout, locked horns with the Re
publicans who were split on the cau
cus nominee. Thomas K. Niedring-
Jiaus, Richard C. Kerens and more
than a scure of other nominees, and the
Assembly chamber became a place \>t
general riot. Efforts were made to pre
vent a roll call on the seventh ballot.
Sevt-ral men attempted to tear the pre
siding officer from the chair, and the
Democrats tried to effect an adjourn
ment without election. The time for
the sine die adjournment had been set
for 3 o'clock by concurrent resolution
and as the hour approached the Mock
was smashed in the melee.
Amid an uproar that almost baffled
control at times, the seventh ballot of
the day was taken, resulting in the
election of Major William Warner.
The vcte stood: Warner 91, Cockrell 83,
Niedringhaus 1.
* The total vote was 175, making 88
necessary to a choice, and Warner re
ceived three votes more than a major
ity.
Major William Warner has practiced
law in Kansas City since 1865. He is
United States Attorney for the West
ern District of Missouri.
Mfcjor Wferrprâwds"twrnHn' Wiscon
sin in IS4O. He served through the
Civil War with distinction in the Thir
ty-third â¢ and Forty-fourth Wisconsin
regiments. He represented the Fifth
Missouri District in Congress from 1885
to 1659. In 1892 he was a candidate for
(Governor and in 1887 was voted for by
the Republican legislators for United
States Senator, when the late George
G.Â«.Vfest was re-elected.
. .Major Warner was the first depart
ment commander of the Grand Army'
of the Republic in Missouri, and from
3SSS to 18S9 was national commander in
chfef.

Eccentricity Charged
Late Charles M.
Stebbins.
BpeclÂ«4 Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, March 18â Charles M.
Stebbins, who left an estate valued at
approximately $500,000 and cut off his
thrt-~ children with a few hundred dol
lar? each, was a man of many eccen
tricities, it appears. Among them were
the following:
He wrote a book, "The New and True
Religion." explaining his religious
views, and put a provision in his will
that it be published and a copy sent to
the postmaster of every town in the
I'nifd States, to be given to a man of
good moral conduct.
He advocated free love and limited
marriage, leaving the offspring to win
fame and fortune from the world.
He used a harness like the Mexican
water carriers use to carry provisions
from town to his home, a distance of
two miles, in all sorts of weather, al
though he had plenty of horses in his
etables.
He put bars on the windows , and
doore of his home to keep in two young
girls, whom he held practically in sla
very.
Many young men and women claim
ing he was their father are intervening
in the suit started by his legitimate
children.
Josiah Townsend, a real estate dealer
of White Plains, X. V., and a lifelong
friend of the deceased, testified to these
peculiarities of the deceased to-day. He
swore that he believed Stebbins to have
been insane over women. Testifying
regarding having seen the slave girls
in Stebbins' home at White Plains, he
said:
"Ob one occasion I went there and
he had two young Spanish girls; one 16
and the other about IS years of age. I
saw them through a window, over
which he had placed iron bare. I asked
why he barred them in and he replied
that it wap because they were used to
bars in their native land and did not
f f -f\ safr unless they had them upon
the windows in this country.
Townsend's testimony was so racy
thai women were excluded from the
courtroom.
The bulk of Stebbins' money was left
to found a children's home in Denver,
which will not be done if the will be
broken.

Russian Rear Guard Fights
Stubbornly to Cover
the Retreat
Two Armies Are R&c^ng on Parallel
Eoads for Positions on i-un

YIN'KOW, Manchuria, March 18.â
It i- reported that the Russian rear
guard is lighting n heavy action in
the vicinity of Kniyuan, about twenty
miles north of Tie Pass.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 19, 1 a. m.
Reports received from the retiring com
mander in chief and the new com
mander in Manchuria, which were
issued last night, while relieving the
immediate fear of the Russian people
that the Manchurian army already is
cut off and confirming information al
ready received that the retirement is
In full progress, throw no further light
upon the- condition or the losses of the
army and contain no disquieting Infor
mation. â¦
The city of Fakoman, which is well
in the Russian rear, has been seized by
forces given out as Chinese bandits,
but which may be a vanguard of Jap
anese regulars.
From Fakoman one road leads to
Kaiyuan, about twelve miles north of
Tie Pass, and the great Chinese road
runs northward, paralleling the rail
road, and offering to a force there the
alternative of striking directly the Rus
sian line or of pushing on toward the
Sungari River, along the highway,
â rhiafa is better than the road over
which General Linevitch will have to
retreat. The new commander will need
all the strategic qualities of Kuropat
kin to effect his withdrawal safely.
OYAMA DOOMS HARBIN.
How far or rapidly Field Marshal
Oyama will be able to continue pursuit
remains to be seen, but the Chinese at
Harbin expect him there on April 10,
and if this opinion proves to be founded
on a Japanese proclamation many per
sons here, remembering the fulfillment
of Oyarna's asurances regarding the oc
cupation of Mukden on March 10, will
be inclined to name three weeks as the
limit.
The Russian Government continues
to declare that, whatever be the fate
of Harbin and of the present Eastern
army, the war will continue. Vice Ad
miral Rojestvensky's orders to try is
sue with Vice Admiral Togo have not
been canceled. Preparations for the
mobilization of a new army are con
tinuing and the finance department is
busy with measures to provide neces
sary funds.
The lapse of a full week since the be
ginning of the retreat from Mukden
finds the Russians in almost complete
ignorance of details as to the effect
of that reverse. Kuropatkin, before re
linquishing his baton, reported his in
sbilily to give details of the losses and
no private dispatches referring to the
number of prisoners or their'organiza
tions have been allowed to sift through
the strict censorship. The public sim
ply knows that the lists of killed,
v. ounded and prisoners are great and
is prepared to believe them enormous
though one Russian correspondent ex
presses the belief that they will not
exceed 80,000, all told. The full story
of the awful retreat from Mukden to
Tie Pa?s slso remains to be told.
CANNON NEEDLESSLY LOST.
Later reports received confirm the
first statements that the bulk of the
armies retired in good order, the mo
mentary panics affecting only the sol
diers who were crowded among the
transports in charge of undisciplined
officers and fleeing civilians, causing
the loss, however, of a great amount of
supplies and a number of cannon
which, otherwise, they would have been
able to bring off.
Though the mobilization orders may
bring on disturbances and even upris
ings for the moment, the internal con
dition is somewhat better. The prin
cipal peasant disturbances have been
quieted. Though sporadic disorders
still exi6t, there has been no general
spread, and the authorities have man
ifested ability to cope with the situ
ation. The strikes also have collapsed,
and the industrial activity has been
resumed until May 1, at least, when
the soda! Democrats profess an in
tention to renew the economic agita
tion.
The renewal of the Viceroyalty and
the appointment of the Senatorial com
mission gives hope of better things in

VON PLEHVE'S ASSASSIN TELLS
WHY HE KILLED MINISTER.
Sasoneff, the assassin of Yon Plehve, the Russian Minister of the Interior, while awaiting trial for his crime prepared a
remarkable statement giving reasons for use of the bomb by the Fighting Section of the Russian Socialists. In this state
ment he declares that the Socialists are not a party of force; that they are compelled to resort to extreme measures through
the cruelties of such men as Minister Yon Plehve.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 18.âBe
fore Sasaneff, the assassin of Minister ol j
the Interior Yon Plehve, was brought to j
trial he composed a lengthy statement I
which he intended to present to the |
Judges as a justification of his act. His
lawyer at the time informed the Asso- i
ciated Press that the document alone
proved Sasoneff was not only a man
of superior intellect, but a deep thinker.
Owing to the limited time allowed at
the trial Sasoneff was unable to read
i the document to the Judges, being
obliged to content himself with a brief |
oral statement. The document, which, j
however, was made part of the record
in the case, has now fallen into the
hands of the Associated Press, and,
aside from its remarkable character,
proves especially interesting at this
time, as it sets forth the views and
aims of the Fighting Organization of
the social revolutionary party which
has Just brought about the death of the
Grand Duke Sergius. It shows clearly
that acts of terror committed by the
Fighting Organization are in the exe
cution of sentences passed upon officials
and others held responsible for fighting
wiih cruel repression the peaceful
propaganda of the larger party. The
acts for which Yon Plehve was con
demned are given in detail. But per
haps the most interesting portion of
the statement is the pathetic personal
biograpby of Sasoneff and the analysis
of the mental process by which he
gradually grew interested in political
actions, becoming an advocate of so
cialism and later being driven by suf
ferings in exile into the ranks of the
terrorists by whom he wan chosen to
kill Van Plehve.
Sasoneff 's statement follows:
"1 am accused of playing an active
role in the Fighting Section of the So
cial Democrats, which it is said has as
its aim to overthrow the present form
of Government and the established
laws of Russia and the existing social
conditions of Russia.
"1 am accused of using explosives for
murdering officials of the state, and
"1 am accused of having killed the
Minister of Interior. Plehve. to attain
the ends of the Social Democrats.
"To these accusations I can answer:
"Yes, I was a member of the Social
Revolutionists and had the honor of
being a member of the Fighting Sec
tion of the Social Democrats, and by I
the latter's orders I killed Plehve. I i
myself guilty of the intentions of which
do not consider either the society or
we are accused, viz.. to by force at
tempt the overthrow of the existing i
form of government and the social con- I
ditions of the country. The society has i
no such large aim? as to overthrow the !
form of autocratic government In
Russia.
'First of all I must state that one
cannot say that the 'Fighting Section'
Is a 'secret society' in the usual sense
of the word. The 'Fighting Organiza
tion' is not a separate body, but only
a part of the big party of Social Revo
lutionists, and the 'Fighting Organiza
tion* follows out strictly the orders of
the larger society. Therefore, it is not
possible to talk about the 'Fighting Or
ganization' alone, but one must also In
clude the party of Social Revolutionists.
"I cannot say that it is by means of
the activity ol tho- Fighting Organise.^
A.SSASSIN OF MINISTER YON PLEHVE. WHO DECLARES THAT DEATH i>F
OFFICIAL WAS DUE TO HIS OWN rRI'ELTY. AND THAT RUSSIAN SO
CIALISTS USE BOMBS ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO IT BY TORTURE
tion that the Social Revolutionists wish
to do away with the autocratic form of
government or even the present social
conditions of Russia, nor is it by means
of terroristic acts that they intend to
gain their ends, but there is one thing
which the party meets by terroristic
acts carried out by members of the
'Fighting Organization,' and that is to
answer by armed attack those acts of
the Government where the lives and
honor of Russian citizens are not
spared, nor to speak of the life and
honor of the Russian revolutionists.
NOT PARTY OF FORCE.
Ideals of Social Revolutionists Are
Peaceful.
"We are not a party of force. Our
party Is in principle against all forms
of force and attaining their aims by
force. The ideals of the party, as are
also the means by which they agitate
for their ideals, are all of peaceful
character. How much the ideals of the
Social Revolutionists are peaceful is
shown from the fact that the Govern
ment laws do not forbid the entry into
the country of many books of social
istic nature. It is not we who agitate
among the various classes of society.
The agitation arises without our help.
It Is not we who made the classes, and
they are not 'one whole' and with one
interest. As many as there are in so
ciety different groups of inhabitants
with different means of existence, so
many are there different Interests which
are in no way mutual. The peasants
and workmen have one interest, the
labor employers and land-owners have
others. We Social Democrats support
the Interests of the working classes. It
is our task to try to learn the needs
of the people and also to learn hojv
they can be fulfilled. We Socialists find
that in society there ought not to exist
any exploitation on one part of the
population by the other, and that all
the means of production, such as
workshops, factories and the land,
ought not to belong to individuals, but
to society at large and should always
be under the control and management
of the people. Such is our final ideal,
which meant peace on the face of the
earth and for the people thereof. All
the rest of our tasks are in stric* ac
cordance with thi3 ideal. It is our
leading star. Our present task we
consider to be to- arrange that the ex
ploitation of the workmen by the em
ployers and the inhabitants in general
by the state should be as small as pos
sible. We come to the people with our
peace ideals and present them in such
a manner that they can see their best
interests and teach them to find for
themselves the best means of fighting
for those idealr Without us there
were strikes, accompanied by the
breaking of machines, and also without

the Acts of His Victim.
us there existed disorders during which
landlords were killed. We try as much
as possible to keep the workmen and
peasants from using: force and to teach
them to right for their ideals in a peace
ful way. The trouble does not come
from what we teach the people, but
from the fact that they are in a totally
different position before the law to the
land-owners and labor employers. The
exploitation is protected by the law and
the fighting against exploitation Is to
fight against the laws, We Socialists do
not Insist on the people taking our
views. We only want to tell them the
truth. The means by which we agitate
are of a peaceful character. We ex
press our views by means of the press
and by means of speech. We hate and
despise all kinds of violence. We are
certain that to struggle against a con
viction is useless, as you can fight it
as much as you like, crucify it, wipe
off the face of the world its originators,
but it will always arise again, stronger
than before.
"Our relations to the state are In
reality indifferent, if only the people
had the right to talk freely and fight
for their own interests, and were these
rights not taken away from the So
cialists. Where the public and de
clared Socialist have that right
equally the conditions of the states do
not suffer from the socialistic propa
ganda, but there, also, of course, the
rich cry out against the struggles of
the 'interior enemies of the country.'

cialists so much hate the word 'revorti

Russia. Even if we Socialists did not
Â»xist the need would nevertheless exist,
i- octal opinion has no adequate means
of making itself heard in Russia. That
which the Russian press speaks of
daily cannot be called an expression of
Russian social opinion, because only
one party can talk freely, and so freely
that it becomes for intelligent people
a joke. Of the Russian social opinion
c-ne can judge only by those occur
rence* where th*Â» press is subject to
punishment. Social opinion yearns for
freedom to speak of those questions
which are forbidden to tho> press. So
cial opinion speaks eloquently in these
cases where the newspapers are black
ened out by the censor, when they are
stopped, and when they are subjected
to reprimand and finally suppressed.
The Russian social opinion objects
when the presidents or the Zemstvu
towns at the meetings forbid the
speakers to treat vital questions in
accordance with their views and opin
ions. Russian social opinion Is only
free when it is handcuffed and speaks
eloquently only when it is silent.
Therefore we Russian Socialists and
revolutionists count ourselves in the
moral right to assert that in Russia
the Government doÂ«?s not allow the ma
jority of the people to speak freely, that
it doe*, not represent their opinion and
a'ta against the wishes and wants of
the majority and that it does not fulfill
its purpose.
"Of this last we are compelled to tell
the people. We are compelled to spread
the idea of changing the existing order
of things in Russia. We preach what
Is essential for the people, the right
freely to air their needs through the
press and meetings; the right to dis
cuss and make laws, the right to con
trol the state expenses. Yes, we So-
cial Revolutionists preach this and con-
sequently preach' a totally different
condition than that existing at present
in Russia. But at present we are only
hing. Our weapons are the Â»rlnt
ing press and word of mouth. Where
is the forcible doing away with the ex
isting regime? Who ia it that uses
force? We or somebody else?
"We have not time to make ourselves
heard before our mouths are shut, and
for a word we are sent to prison or Si
beria. Our press is called illegal. The
authors of the articles, even the typo
graphists, know of the sad life in Si
beria. The simple reading of our
brochures ia regarded by the state aa
criminal.
"We are persecuted as Government
criminals and subject to punishment
for participation in club meetings
where we discuss our tasks. We are
subjected to humiliating corporal pun
ishment, beaten with knouts, trampled
over by horses and firea on when we
decide to come out into the air to de
clare publicly our views and express
our demands.
"We are debarred the protection <Â«f
the law. We are declared Interior ene
mies of the people and political crim
inals, although this is not one and the
same thing.
TRIUMPH OF IDEALS.
Serious Labor and Other Reform*
Are Demanded.
"Yes. there is much force used, far
too much, but which aide uses it?
"Therefore, let them not say that the
party of Social Revolutionists is try
ing to obtain something by meant of
force. Neither in the aim of the party
nor in the means of attaining its ends
is there anything like force. Perhaps
force" refers to that moment when tm
final ideals of the party will be near
attainment, when the social conditions
will be replanned on the ruins of thf
present Government, and Russians will
become not only subjects but citizens
of their country. Perhaps the accusa
tion means that the party will first at
tempt a political change in Russia and
then a social one. To this I reply that
the party does not decide the question
as to how the present conditions will
be changed to those wished for. Of the*
establishment of the social conditions
to which our party is pleaged, it is im
possible to talk even seriously. The
organization of the social conditions of
the empire on the basts of socialism
would be an impossibility even for the
powerful bureaucracy. The tasks of our
party are sometimes understood, but
for understanding them you are sent
to goals. Russia will get socialistic re
construction possibly when the name of
Russia will not exist longer on the
earth. So far as the final triumph of
our ideals is concerned:, this triumph
will take place not only here in Russia,
but over the whole world- But it will
undoubtedly not take place anywhere
while the Russian autocratic empire
exists, because up to now the progres
sive movements of the best -Informed
people have broken to pieces against
this 'strength.' In the meantime we are
fighting in other states under the ban
ner of socialism and have advanced
further than any bourgeois party, and
we Russian Socialists are doing the
same. We demand serious labor re
forms and serious reforms for thÂ«
whole people.
'With reference to the question of
political revolution, the Russian Gov
ernment mast be made to understand
that it is standing over a volcano. We
Socialist Revolutionists are at present
conducting a peaceful propaganda^ but
one from which the autocratic mgim?
of the empire received a death TSund
forty years ago. Its term rarnj io an
end together with the fall of .^dom,
which was about equal to the patriar
chial system. The people, together
with the delivery from serfdom, re
ceived the right to have independent
thought and govern its own destinies.

ADVANCE
OPENING OF TRANS-ATLANTIC
WIRELESS SERVICE
v The return of Mr. Marconi to this country on March 30 gives
every assurance that the opening of the wireless service with Eng-
land is near at hand. The cable charge between the United States
and England is 25 cents a word; the wireless charge, 10 cents. It
is reasonable to expect that the public will favor the cheaper rate.
In addition to increasing largely the company's assets, this Trans-
Atlantic Station will return to the MARCONI COMPANY a net
profit sufficient to pay per cent diyidend. With 14 such Trans-
Atlantic Stations, paralleling the :14 cables, the, net profit would be
over $10,000,000, thereby increasing the dividend to 150 per cent.
In view of this fact, which 1 will be a great event in the world's his-
tory, and on account of the extraordinary development of this system
during the past twelve months, the price of Marconi Securities will ,

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. MARCH 10. 1905.
Terrorist Gives .
His Reasons for
Killing Minister
Continued From Pasre 25, Column 7.
The reforms of the first years of Alex
ander ll's reign showed that he under
stood the needs of the times and ad
vanced to meet them. Zemstvo courts
were built up by him on the basis of
' national autonomy, but having taken
that step on the road to the lc/gical de
velopment of the results of the fall of
serfdom, the Government plainly feared
the consequences, stopped and suddenly
turned back. From that time the Rus
sian people have been awaiting contin
uation. The continuation must and will
come. The question is, who will intro
duce it and lead itâ the people them
"selves, or will~lt come from above?
"We Social Revolutionists up to the
present have been struggling with the
existing regime in a peaceful manner,
pur task is to make .plain to the people
that the present system is unsatisfac
tory. Our task is to organize the opin
ion of the majority in the state, that is
to say. that minority which at present
co-neiÃts of the leading force In the
country in a moral sense, and by its
energy, which is comparatively free
and which has broad views. The Gov
ernment stands in the way of the in
telligent. It will not count any more
with the party ..of Social Revolutionists
which the Government accuses of con
tinued encroachment on its existence.
The party is not to blame In this. It
Is right if behind the party are the
majority of the people. The duty of
the Government is to meet the wishes
of the people.
TERRORISTIC ACTS.
Sad Necessity Compels the Use of
Force.
"The method of nghtiÂ«g of the party
is by means of word, proof and convic
tion, and this is the only means of agi
tation which the party has and upon
which the party is conducted.
"The sad necessity of terroristic acts
falls cm the party wholly taken up with
a peaceful flght.
"Terroristic acts are a necessity .
which suddenly fall on the party as
something irrelevant and foreign to
its original aims. The programme of
the party declares such acts detrimen
tal, and we would never have resort to
arms but for the unlimited freedom of
action allowed to the chinovniks, the
acts of whom force us to it. Only force
Is answered by force. Only in those '
cases when the Ministers and chinov- i
nikp refuse us the right to speak ver
bally do we speak 'another language.'
Onh- when ail other means are ex- \
hausted we answer by death. Only
after insufferable tortures, awful hu
miliation at citizens and revolutionists
do we go to extreme measures.
'The activity of the Tighting Or
ganization' is only called into play on
special occasions. The acts of the
Fighting Organization' are of a re
fieetory nature, corresponding to the
character of thÂ£ impulse.
"Look at what the "Fightin* Organi
zation' has done up to new.? You will
see that it has never had resource to
arms as a special independent meanfe
of fighting the present system. The
Social Revolutionists more than any
body else understand that an Idea can
not be done away with by means of
bullets, and that bombs do not break
down systems. An idea can be con
quered and destroyed, but a system
falls only when the foundation which
upholds it is rotten and broken down.
"In order to show the real character
of our terroristic tactics, remember the
â¢Party of the People's Will.' which our
party considers its foster mother. The
theories of that party and we, their
'children,' are the same, but the condi
tions under which the members of the
'People's Will' lived and acted are dif
ferent from the conditions of the prea- j
ent day. Then the Government ter- !
rorized, now we. Then the people only â¢
just freed from serfdom were illiterate.
Habit of living and thinking independ
ently was stamped out of them during
centuries. In one word, the nation had
hardly got away from slavery and was
in its infancy. The members of the
'People's Will' were persuaded by ex
perience that to fulfill the difficult mis
sion of agitating socialistic ideas
among such an unconscious people, and
having before them the ghost of the
white terror, was an unproductive ac
tion. Losing hope that the people
would fight independently for their own
interests or come to the help of their
champions, the members of the 'Free
Will' by means of the red terror de
cided to conquer or die. But they were
forsaken alone on the field of battle and
had to fight like Titans.
"We Social Revolutionists, children of
the twentieth century, do not feel our
selves alone; on the contrary, w*e feel
behind us the people's strength. Since
the monarchic regime was mortally
wounded forty years ago the nation has
grown intellectually. It already has
wants, and is able to think and govern
its own destinies. The members of the
party of 'Free Will' dreamed of pre
senting the nation with free institu
tions as a present obtained from the
Government in single combat. We have
no such 'broad aims. We are much
more modest. The system is already
falling under the pressure of national
needs which it now ceases to satisfy,
and under the pressure of national dis
content with it. The nation has prob
lems and demands. If we followed the
example of the members of the 'Free
Will,' and if we have taken to arms, It
is only because representatives of a
Government which is dying out have
taken charge of the autocratic power
and have gone quite out of the bounds ;
of humanity in their dealings with us
revolutionists and the dissatisfied
people. We are treated like hunted and
beaten animals. For this reason we
have bared our teeth and taken to
arms.

I threw the bomb at Mr. Plehve, not in

imprisoned in the fortress and subject
ed our comrades to all kinds of tor
tures and punishments. He forced us
to rise against him as the persecutor
and murderer of the people. Balma
shev and Heketch were placed on the
scaffold. Gershuni and Femkina were
buried in Slusselberg fortress. Such
facts we Social Revolutionists cannot
but regard'as crimes, and the fault of
these crimes lies on the head of the
man who carried on an untruthful fight
for the state.
"Second â Plehve as director of the
Department of Police choked the party
of 'People's Free Will' by means of
jails, fortresses, penal servitude, pris
ons and exile. People had no opportu
nity of forgetting his hangman. The
old-time hangman again placed his
white hand on the people's necks. To
speak about forgetting was only pos
sible in case Plehve tried to redeem his
former crimes by reforms and conces
sions during the latter part of his life.
"Thirdâ Plehve, before the declara
tion of war with Japan, arranged a
war In the interior of RuÃsia. He look
ed on Russia as though it was a for
eign country. He strewed the land
with its citizens' blood. He shot the
workmen when they spoke plainly
about their needs and their Interests.

word 'Fire,' he is guilty because the
shooting was initiated by him as Min
ister of the Interior, and by orders. of
men who fulfilled the orders of him who
had uppointed them. As he did not
punish the Governors, he himself sanc
tioned their deeds and gave temptation
to other high dignitaries to act just as
cruelly.
"Fourthâ The personal dignity of the
Russian citizens during Plehve's gov
ernment was subjected to the basest
humiliation; peasants and workmen
were subjected to wholesale corporal
punishment. Yon Wahl and Obolensky
received promotion and reward. Rus
sian revolutionists were beaten and
humiliated on every possible occasion
in the police stations by the policemen
and secret police. Russian revolution
ists and citizens were humiliated and
beaten in piisons, and sometimes their
position there became so unbearable
that they refused food and starved
themselves in protest against insults.
MASSACRE OF JEWS.
Plehve Does Not Prevent Slaughter
At Klshenev.
"Fifthâ Plehve put on the hungry
heavy taxes. When the peasants,
driven to extremities by hunger, want
of arable land and subjected by the
land-owners, not seeing and not expect
ing help from anywhere, tried to obtain
bread by force so as not to die, they
were answered with an increase of
taxation. This was Plehve's idea of
satisfying national needs. In this man
ner he gave them a stone instead of
bread. In this manner he deprived the
naked of their only shirt. Plehve ex
hausted the people, spending their
hard-earned money on the development
of the secret police in Russia and on
the protection of his own person.
"Sixthâ Plehve allowed the willful
massacre of the Klshenev Jews in the
presence of the police; Jews, old men,
women and children, were beaten and
killed. Women were insulted, the
property of the poor Jews was de
stroyed and plundered. Of Plehve's
participation in this willful massacre
the foreign press and the Russian revo
lutionary press clearly made mention.
Further mention of this is made in the
description of the circumstances which
preceded it and which description was
given in the more or less decent organs
of the Russian press. How can we
trust the information given by the
Government? What right have we to
believe either It or the servile remarks
of the Official Messenger? What right
have we to believe either it or the ser
vile remarks of the antl-semitic news
papers, when they attempt to exempt
Plehve from participation in this
crime and attempt to put all the blame
on the drunken crowd of vandals and

My family \v;ls highly religious and
rnonart hial md had emigrated from
a vilkige to a town, where they be
came wealthy in the exploitation of
Hi*- Bashkir forests. The spirit with
whHh I was brought up, while en
tirely under the influence of my fam
ii... was utterly opposed to every kind
oi protest and discontent with the con
ditions of Russian life. Photographs
of the Emperor and ikons ornamented
the walls of the house of my father.

comrades without exception was
'hated house." There they stamped
out all life, they extinguished system
ily our spirit and the lively ques
tions' which tame into our young
mir.ds. Not. only did the latter get
no answer, but the most interesting
subjects of history were suppressed,
and the teachers openly jeered at the
Jews and Poles. It was not the fault
Of the Russian teachers; they were
usec to reading the lies which the
Government told them, and it was con
' trary to their own ideas and perhaps
'to former traditions. And so I was a
total stranger to any general wants,'
and without any formed Ideas of the
existing laws of Russia. If I had any
t-ort of humanitarian opinions, to these
I am wholly indebted to Russian liter
ature and school has nothing to do
with them. I went to Moscow Uni

so that in the end I could be zemskie
doctor â a doctor absolutely for the
poor. I was compelled to offend my
father seriously because I would not
follow his advice and enter some spe
cial high school in order to make a
brilliant career as an engineer. The
ivord "career' hateful to me. The
knowledge which 1 got in the univer
sity and in the public library made a
iota! revolution in my mind. A few
months changed my former ideas. But
this was only an intellectual revolu
tion. My first year in the university
1 read ihe Viedomosti and the Sviet.
I ne^er thought of revolution and if I
cÂ»d know something about it, it was
only from what occasionally appeared
5n the papers. I took no interest in
It and found the idea to be not a cor
rectct one. In the year 1899, when the
students were demonstrating, I was
absent from such demonstrations.
What the etudents wanted 1 could not
really understand. To their meetings
I di(? not go and only from pure
friendly feeling I refused to take the
examination for the second standard.
I was a man more or less of independ
ent means and I was ashamed to leave
:ny friends on the first standard who
! were Involved in the demonstration.
FAITH is SHATTERED.
Ijcarus How Riches Are Obtained at
University.
â¢ my during my second year at the
university I happened to come quite
accM< ross questions of social
(haracter, thanks to reading books of
political economy and universal his
tory. I was well versed in general
commerce, taking part in the business
cf my parents even while at school.
That in why I know by what means
riches are created. I can regard con
scientiously all questions which are
supposed to be social signs. A? I de
veiuped and my opinions took concrete
form my idea* became idealistic and
liberal, in a humanitarian more than
a political sense. I did not read any
more with faith the Sviet and Vido
mosti. Preaching of corporal punish
ment and hate of mankind revolted
me. The -second year of life at the
university pajseed very well with me.
I did not take part in the meetings
and did not know where they had
their clubs. About the question and
â¢ nee of labor problems in Russia
I was ignorant. Illegal literature I had
never seen. I was so naive that the
acquaintance of a Moscow workman

man wanted to learn from me poetry
and arithmetic. I met him openly
and did not know that such kind of
acquaintances could be called sus
picious and could lead to disagreeable
consequences for both of us. 1 taught
this man arithmetic, but I do not re
member ever having mentioned politics
to him.
'My revolutionary life began in the
beginning of 1901, when I took part
conscientiously in the students' move
ments, which began from the time the
Kielt and St. Petersburg students were
sent to serve in the army. At this
time 1 was neither socialist or revo
lutionist. At most I was pimply a lib
eral. The first illegal literature which
came to my notice was the students'
proclamations. My comrades know
v.e\i with what difficulty I was brought
to tr.ke part in the protest against the
breaking of laws and the military ser
vice which was forced on the other
students. I already knew that if I de
cided to protest I would go to the end
ana for this I would be compelled to
s.'ivo in the army. At that time there
was a rumor that several students had
been shot who refused to swear alle
giance and would not obey orders.
The Russian press was forbidden to
v/ritc about the students. Only 'the
Moscow Viedomosti occasionally wrote
something. It seemed to me as if a
pheet had fallen over Russia and
through this sheet could be seen va
rious things which I could not under
stand. I plunged into the demonstra
tion, notwithstanding the prayers of
my father to be .cautious. The year
1901 was fatal to me as well as to
many others. When the first shot In
Kharkoff was heard I got afraid. I
had the idea that perhaps I also was
in some way to blame, but the next
occurrence, as if on purpose, reversed
my ideas. I saw how the police were
meddling in the affairs and were play
ing spy. I had the pleasure of being
fummoned before the local court,
where they tried to give me the idea
that the Government could not stoop
to the students and would not do so.
I was in the Moscow menage, where
T was sent with many other students.
There we sat three days guarded by
Cofsacks and soldiers. There I heard
how outside the workmen and other
people tried to break the doors in
order to release us, but we saw that
against our deliverance there was a
row of soldiers ready to shoot our
rescuers down. After that we were
sent to Butirshoe prison and 1 became
a convict. , In this prison I, for the
rust time, became acquainted with
bocks of revolution? For the first time
I heard the brave word 'revolution.'
At this time in Moscow there hap
pened a demonstration of the work
men, who were helping the students
on the great battlefield of political re
form. At this time the Holy Synod ex
communicated the celebrated writer,
Tolstoy. I knew Tolstoy only as a
balladist and did not know his reli
piour- opinions, and now teamed that
this favored writer was cursed for sins
which were not known to me. The
priests cursed Tolstoy openly. I
learned that there is no freedom of
speech in Russia. At this time Peters
burg students were beaten unmerci
fully with whips at the time of a
demonstration on Kazan Square. So,
after being involved in these affairs,
I came out a rrtan with revolutionary
Inclinations. My destiny was decided.
AGAIN IX THE TOII,S.
Platoed in Cell for Possessing Illegal
Literature.
My coming to the way of thinking of
active revolutionists was only a matter
of time. Only a month or two had
passed when I was arrested again, in
April of 1901. I was accused of being*
in possession of illegal literature. Yes,
after my exclusion from the university,
I gradually began reading the books
of socialistic nature, and read illegal
editions, becoming more acquainted
T.ith the tasks of the revolutionists,
w*tb their ways of agitating and began
to feel myself in sympathy with them.
But when they arrested me so soon
after my banishment from Moscow I
had no time, in spite of my good
wishes and convictions, to show any
activity. I was arrested first for my
convictions, for my ideas, and on ac
count of this I could not take an active
part in the movement. After banish
men f on account of my convictions I
could not help being a revolutionist.
"The Government made me a revo
lutionist. It declared me to be outside
the law. It forced me to the revolu

"My relation to terror at that time

who came to me. told me that the life
of one student was nothing in com
parison with the interests of the State.
He was right; the year did not pass
â without seeing the sacrifice of many
hundreds of lives for the state. The
result of my fast was that I was sent
to Samara prison. In Samara I had
a chance of meeting revolutionists who
were chosen from all parts of Russia.
From them, as from personal wit
nesses, I knew what had happened to
me had happened to others. I, myself,
saw people who were beaten in prisons
and in police courts; people who were
many times compelled to hunger for
many days together; people, who from
want and prison life, went into con
sumption. Every day I saw parties of
political prisoner* going to Siberia.
"While in prison I read revolution
ary literature and thinking of all I
had seen and heard I became a social
revolutionist. I had a heartrending
feeling when I heard of the fights go
ing on in Vilna and Kharkoff, and es
pecially the shooting of the Kharkoff
workmen. I knew that men were shot
as enemies of the state." They were
men who did not even understand the
word revolution. They were only at
fauit because they did not want their
wages decreased. I knew that people
of all classes and of all ages were
beaten, women and Children also. We
took it as a signal for battle. We
thought of the twenty-eight coffins, the
Innumerable wounded, the two volleys
by the 100 soldiers. Hearing of this I
tried to think of a battle scene, but
thit- picture was nothing in compari
son with the dreadful scene which was
beinfc enacted by the Government in
the peaceful streets of small Russian
towns. With what hefpless rage I
walked about my prison cell. How I
knocked my head against the walls
and broke my hands In trying to smash
the prison windows, and what servile
and bitter tears I wiped from my eyes.
I prayed to be able to revenge It all.
Ah! if I had freedom * â¢ * but
when I got to know that the execu
tioner of the inhabitants had perished
I breathed freely. God bless the men
who had done the deed. Bogdanovitch
had to perish. His existence fouled
the air. L,ikÂ« a etorm it hung over
uc and all held their breath and
waited. Only Bogdanovitch did not
wait. Having obtained Plehve's ap
proval, this horrible executioner con
sidered himself safe, visited his mis
tress openly and walked in the parks
enjoying the spring of life.

whole row of murders and other
crimes committed by Ministers and
their agents forced me, first to justify
myself and then to enter on the pro
gramme of terrorism. How I ad
vanced from theory to acts, I cannot
tell. It would seem that God had
chosen me for this act. When I ran
away from Siberia I felt that spirits
were behind me and would not leave
me either by right or day, whispering
to me, 'You must, you must.' * * *
When I thought of what was done by
Minister Plelwe I felt that I had no
right to my peaceful life. By killing
Piehve I only did what my conscience
demanded of me, and only regret that
together with him his coachman per

was subjected to such a serious

ONE MORE SHIP
FOR UNCLE SAM
Cruiser Washington Is
Launched at Yards of New
York Ship Building Firm
PHILADELPHIA, March 18.â The
armored cruiser Washington was
launched at the yards of the New
York Ship Building Company at Cam
den, N. J., to-day. The event signalized
two innovations in the launching of a
warship. The Washington was the
first naval vessel to be launched by
the United States by means of an'
automatic trigger device which obvi
ated the customary sawing of the sole
piece at the bow. The cruiser was also
the first war vessel to be launched
f fom beneath a glass covered 3 shed
from a shipyard in the East.
Miss Helen Stewart Wilson, daughter
of former United States Senator John
L. Wilson of Washington, christened
the cruiser.
The familiar sounds of the knocking
away of the keel Blocks and the saw
ing of the plank were missing at the
launching. Instead, one man went
down to the keel amidships, aad, oper
ating a hand valve, released two heavy
steel triggers, which in turn removed
a castiron stay. As the huge craft
began to move, Miss Wilson swung the
traditional bottle against the vessels
bow. There was a terrific din from
the steam craft lying close to the yard
as the Washington moved into the
river.
The armored cruiser Washington,
which was launched to-day at the
yards of the New York Ship Building
Company, is a sister ship to the
cruiser Tennessee, launched at Cramps'
shipyards last December. While not
designed to be quite as fast as some
of the lighter armored cruisers, she
will have greater battery and defensive
power than any vessel classed as a
cruiser. The armor plate protection
ranges frdm nine inches for the tur
rets to five inches for the belt. The
main battery will consist of four 10
inch guns and 16 6-inch guns. The
secondary battery will have twenty
three 8-inch rapid-fire guns; twelve 3
pounder semi-automatic guns, two I
pounder automatic and two 1-pounder
rapid-fire guns, two 3-inch field pieces
and three small caliber rapid-fire ma
chine guns.
The indicated horsepower of the
engines is twenty-three thousand ana
they are designed to drive the vessel
at a speed of at least twenty-two
knots an hour.

In the village of Tsynlittose Christian

IiOSES FAITH IN HER AULY.
Prance Sees No Hope for Russian Suc
cess in the Far East,
PARIS, March 18.â The Russian de
feats, culminating with General Kuro-
I patkin's recall, have completely shak
j en French officials' and public opinion
concerning Russia's ability to Success
fully make head against the complica
tions. The first view that the Russian
reverses were part of a strategic plan
is now entirely abandoned, and all
comment turns on Russia's accumulat
ing misfortunes. The recognized Rus
sian organ, the Echo de Paris, says
: Kuropatkin, follows the path of Alex
| ieff, Stoessel, Orloff, Stark, Gripenberg
J and a long list of others in various
stages of investigation and disgrace,
and a dispatch announcing that Cap-
I tain Clado has been relieved of all
functions appears to emphasize the
I condition of Russia's military demoral
! ization.
The Figaro says Kuropatkin was the
victim of overprudence and lack of
audacity. Military critics point out
that General Linevitch did not gradu
ate from the school of cadets or the
military academy, but began his ser
vice as a volunteer and a private.
Whfle a subordinate officer during the
Russo-Turkish war Linevitch first met
Kuropatkin, then a captain. The lat
ter represents the student soldier, while
Linevitch represents the man from the
ranks.
The peace prospects, although re
cently considered bright, now seem to
have disappeared. The officials say
this is due mainly to Japan's Insist
ence that Russia shall sue for peace,
whereas Russian pride prevents her
taking the initiative. Therefore it is
believed that the war will be indefinite
ly prolonged, with the prospect of a
series of Japanese sucesses above Muk
den.
CELEBRATION IN TORIO.
Exercises Commemorative of the Vic
tory at Mukden.
TOKIO, March 18. â Thirty thou
sand persons went to Hibiya Park to
day to attend exercises commemora
tive of the Japanese victory in the
battle of Mukden. Members of the
Cabinet, the elder statesmen, many
officers of the army and navy and
members of the Diet were present.
Mayor Ozaki read a congratulatory
telegram to be sent to Field Marshal
Oyama on behalf of the municipality,
the crowd cheering Its approval.
Lieutenant General Terauchi, Min
ister of War, and Admiral Yamamoto,
Minister of the Navy, spoke on behalf
of the army and navy respectively,
thanking the people for the support
they had given the Government dur
ing the war.
Sports in the afternoon and a dis
play of fireworks to-night concluded
the celebration.

WHAT SULPHUR DOES
For the Human Body in Health and
l>LÂ«casq.
The* mention of sulphur will recall
to many of us Hit early i! iye when our
mothers and grand mother* grave us
our daily dose of tialphux and mo-
Zasses every spring and Call.
r lt was tlÂ»e universal spring. and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,-
and mind you. this old fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit.
The. ldea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable and a
larpre quantity had to be taken to get
'any effect.
Nowadays we Â«.. all the beneficial
effect* of sulphur In n palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a sin"le grain
is' far more effective th&n a table-
spoonful of the crude sulphur. *
la recent years research and ex-
periment have proven that the best
sulphur for medicinal use is that ob-
tained from Calcium (Calcium Sul-
phide) and sold In drug stores under
the .me of Stuart's Calcium Wafers.
They are small chocolate coated pel-
lets and contain the active medicinal
principle of sulphur in a highly con-
centrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value
of this form of sulphur In restoring
and maintaining bodily vigor and
health; sulphur acts directly on the
liver and excretory organs and puri-
fies and enriches the blood by the
prompt elimination of waste material.
Our RT.-.ndmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo-
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary
flowers of sulphur were often worse
than the disease and cannot compare
with the modern concentrated prep-
aration of sulphur, of which Stuart's
Calcium Wafers Is undoubtedly the
best and most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure
constipation and purify the blood In
a way that often surprises patient and
physician alike.
Dr. R. *1- Wilkln*. while experi-
menting with sulphur remedies soon
found that the sulphur from Calcium
was superior to any other form. He
cays: "For liver, kidney and blood trou-
bles especially when resulting from
constipation or malaria, I have been
surprised at th* results obtained from
'Stuart's CalciUm Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have
repeatedly seen them dry up and dis- â 
appear in four or .five days, leaving j
the skin clear and smooth. Although i
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie- !
etary article and sold by druggists and j
for that reason tabooed by many phy- j
sicians, yet I know of nothing to safe I
and reliable for constipation, liver and j
kidney troubles and especially in all j
forms of skin disease as this remedy." I
At any rate people who are tired of j
pills cathartics and so-called blood
"purifier*." will find in Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more palat-
able and effective preparation. â¦'â¢-â
STOCK MARKET
IS FLUCTUATING
Activity of Bulls and Bears
Causes Rapid Changes in
â¢ the Prices of Securities
NEW YORK. March 18â The move
ment of the stock market to-day indi
cated the activity of contending forces
in tb* 1 speculation, and the contest be
tween thÂ«m was rather inconclusive.
The closing was irregular and not far
Â£rum last night's level, after having
been coiteiderably below that in the
early dealings and generally above on
the rally. Stocks were freely sold dur
ing the early dealings and the recovery
set-me-d to be due to profit taking by
the bears, who were disposed to close
up their contracts on the three days'
reaction yreiiminary to the Sunday in
terval in the market.
The showing by the banks in their
â¢vvt-ekly statement, which had been
counted upon by the bears to induce
selling and thus afford them an oppor
tunity to cover, proved to be not so
weak as had been feared, so that the
buying by the shorts was of greater ef
fect. The weight of opinion is in lavor
rnewhat higher rates for money.
But offerings of funds by the trust
companies at the higher rates may be
expected. Foreign exchange continued
its decline in spite of the firmness of
discounts in London.
Total sales of bonds, par val^p, $1.
775,Â«>0.
Speculative sentiment showed itself
distrustful of the market from the
opening of the week, but there wan
good resistance to the moderate pres
sure during the early part of the week
in the absence of any unfavorable pros
pect in the general business, industrial
and financial conditions. With the rise
in the call loan rate for money tbe re
actionary tendency assumed the upper
hand and pressure to sell overweight
ed the market.
The power of the market to resist
short sales and to absorb the heavy
profit taking from time to time and
the constant development of new points
of strength served to convince the
skeptical that stocks were being taken
out of the market by substantial hold-
Ing powers and gave color to the many
minors of accumulations of stocks for
purposes of control and ultimate plans
of combination and readjustments of
relations which were expected to in
crease the values of properties.
The bond market has been less ac
tive and there has been no notable ad
vance jr. price* of railroad mortgages.
TTnltcvi States bonds were all un
changed on call for the week.
VTRIT TO SWEFTHRART
GETS SWAHf rx TROUBLE
Jump* Walls of Penitentiary Instead
of Barrier Surrounding School
Where Girl Resides.
RALEIGH. N. CL, March 18.
Charles Nort. employed at the Tar
borough Hotel, started ' out to call
upon his sweetheart, to accomplish
which it was necessary for him to
climb the walls of Shaw University,
where the girls are kept very close.
â¢On his way to the rear of the grounds,
where Xort had planned to climb the
wall, he was called into a "blind tiger"
and there drank until he was good and
drunk. Then he started out for the
university grounds, but lost his way
and turned up at the State peniten
tiary. There he scaled the stockade
and jumped over into the penitentiary
gTounds. to be met by a bayonet. Nort
wsjs immediately sobered
. -4fter a lecture from the peniten
tiary authorities, who requested him
to be a little more careful on his fu
ture love-making escapades, the man
was released, but it was too late for
him to fill his engagement on the uni
versity grounds.

SUTTER'S FORT
AT EXPOSITION
Replica of Historic Building
to Be I Feature of the
Big Fair at Portland
Special Dlepatcb to The Cali.
SACRAMENTO, March 18.â A prop
osition is under way to rebuild Sutter's
fort at the Portland Exposition. The
model ue proposed will be a complete
restoration of the main building of
Butter's fort on the outskirts of Sac
ramento. At a meeting of the Sac
ramento Valley Development Associa
tion to-day a resolution was passed
ordering and providing means whereby
architects will at once draw up plans
for the construction of a model of
Sutter's fort at Portland and the re
building of the main building of the
fort of the same size and identical in
ever respect with the original building.
It is proposed to construct the build
ing, as It is connected with the finding
or gold in California. It is distinctive
and is the most historic structure in
the Sacramento Valley. As soon as the
plans are completed the proposition
will be submitted to the Board of Su
pervisors of the valley.
'This will be a great thing," said
Harry P. Stabler, vice president of the
association. "Think of the chance it
will give a talker to tell about the
first nugget of gold brought in a few
hours after Marshall's famous dis
covery." General Bldwell was stationed
there at the time.
"The building will be used to house
the Sacramento Valley exhibit," said
Morris Brookes. "The valley is going
ahead by leaps and bounds. The hus
bandry special train which is proposed
by the California Promotion Commit
tee will be of tremendous benefit to
the valley. It will educate our farmers
as to the best crops to grow and will
bt in charge of professors of the State
university. The Portland exhibit and
the husbandry special are two ft the
most important features planned for
the development of the valley. Of
course the special will tour the entire
State."

Explaining That He Is Delayed
by Railroad Washout.
SACRAMENTO, March 18.â When
the case of Harry Bunkers, the ex-
Senator, charged with bribery, was

ceived a telephone message from
Bunkers stating that he had accom
panied ex-Senator Emmons to his
home in Bakersfleld and was unable
to return owing to the washouts that
had occurred on the railroad.
District Attorney Seymour then
asked for a continuance until Monday
and it was Rranted.

ELKS TO AID
BURNED WOMAN
3iembers of a Spokane Lodge
Volunteer to Give Cuticle
to Doctors for Grafting
â¢ptcial Diipatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Wash., March 18.â To
cover the badly burned body of a Lew
iston woman, members of the Elks'
lodge in Spokane will give patches of
their cuticle. It is proposed to as
semble the volunteers, give them
chloroform and graft pieces of cuticle
three inches long and three-quarters
of an inch wide. The skin *vill be
taken from the thigh. Three pieces
will be the limit asked from each vol
unteer.
Mrs. F. B. Sears is the unfortunate
victim of the accident which has se-
BUlted in such a peculiar request for
assistance. Six weeks ago she retired
at Lewiston and, wishing to warm the
bed, placed an electric light bulb, with
the current turned on, at her feet. The
bulb set fire to the bed covers and Mrs.
Sears was horribly burned.
The woman has suffered great agony
and since her arrival at a Spokane'
hospital it has been decided that graft
ing Is necessary. The woman's hus
band is an Elk. As soon as it was
known that grafting would be neces
sary, several Elks volunteered to give
cuticle and it has been decided to ac
cept the offer. There are more than
1000 members in the lodge and no fear
is felt of insufficient volunteers. The
surface to be covered is four square
feet.

TITLES TO LOTS IN TOWN
OF TONOPAH ARE CLEARED
Settlement of the Vexed Question Will
Be Followed by a Boom In
Building.
RENO, New, March 18. â Title to the
lota in the town of Tonopah was clear
ed up to-day when the only man hav
ing a claim against them. Senator T. L.
Oddie, issued a statement saying that
he will make all titles good. The ver
bal agreement entered into by Jim
Butler, the discoverer, in the early his
tory of the camp, will also be re
spected.
This sets at rest a vexed question
and will result in added stimulus to
the building boom at Tonopah, for
many property-holders have held off
because of their titles.

Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
NEW YORK, March 18.â In a lettÂ«r
received in this city to-day came the
announcement that Brother Seraption
Van Koop, a member of a wealthy
Belgian family, who two years ago
went to the Hawaiian Islands to take
up the work begun by Father Damien
In the leper colony of Molokai. has him
self fallen a victim to the disease. The
letter came from the young missionary
himself to Rev. Father John J. Dunn,
head of the local Roman Catholic Mis
sionary Bureau. Brother Van Koop
says:
"A little while after your last let
ter came I discovered that I had no
feeling in my elbow. I remarked the
fact to Rev. Father Maxime. who com
manded me to go to our physician.
After he had examined me he declared
the want of feeling appeared to him
to be a symptom of leprosy, but to
make sure he took from my elbow some
pieces of flesh for a microscopic ex
amination. After a few days he came
to see me and Informed me that very
probably it would prove to be a case
of leprosy. Other physicians confirmed
his diagnosis.
"There is no doubt of it; I am a leper.
These experiments were made on the
11th of the month. That very night I
left Honolulu to return to Molokai,
where I will be compelled to remain
for the rest of my days."
Brother Seraption Van. Koop is 28
years old and In all likelihood he will
never live to see his 31st birthday.
Until the day of his death, as he
set forth, he will live alone in a little
hut of the leper colony. He can have
no companions except those similarly
afflicted.
BITTER WORDS
FOR PEABODY
Ousted Governor Adams
Issues an Address to
the People of Colorado
DENVER, March 18.â Former Gover
nor Alva Adams, who was ousted from
office by the General Assembly, issued
an address "To the People of Colorado"
to-night. It consists of about 2500
words and reviews in scathing terms
the various steps in the contest by
means of which he was unseated. Fol
lowing are extracts from the address:
"Foiled in their attempt to override
the constitution and hold Peabody in
his seat, a fake contest was inaugu
rated. This failed of all purpose, as
enough Republican members would not
forfeit their manhood by voting for a
man that the testimony, as well as the
election returns, said was not elected.
It was clear that Peabody could not be
seated A new scheme must be de
vised, so that coterie of Christian util
ity statesmen â Hearne, Sheedy, Chap
pell and Evansâ met in the Majestic
building on Wednesday evening and
gave birth to the last plan in the ig
noble conspiracy of stealing the Gov
ernorship. Representatives of the anti-
Peabody Republicans were invited. A
resignation of Peabody was offered
and the voucher of the political purity
quartet was given that it was genuine
and that he would abide by it. A man
who had held the great office of Gov
ernor so debased himself as to prom
ise to resign at command if they would
seat him but for a day. This resigna
tion is a confession that he was not
elected, and one that an honest man
honestly elected would rather die than
give.
"We expected fair play; instead the
majority of the Legislature has bowed
to the dictates of corporations who had
selfish needs of the Governorship.
'The greatest anarchists and the
mosx dangerous are often the no-party,
no-consclence heads of great corpora
tions, who use the money and influence
coming from the franchises and privi
leges that are the gifts of the people
to control legislation, to dictate the
personnel of courts and officials, to cor
rupt the ballot.
"The 600.000 Democrats and Republi
cans in Colorado are honest. They
stand amazed at the crime committed
by their representatives and they ar
dently await the hour and the day
when they can rebuke the crime and
those responsible for it.
"A Legislature cannot repeal the dec
alogue. A majority cannot make steal
ing respectable."

WAR AGAINST
FAKE MEDIUMS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 18.â Citizens op
posed to the numerous fake mediums,
fortune tellers and voodoo doctors now
plying their vocation in Chicago have
joined hands with the police in an ef
fort to prosecute these so-called fakers,
and, if possible, drive them out of busi
ness.
The first step taken by those inter
ested in this new crusade was in the
nature of a meeting held to-night, at
which an organization was formed, the
object of which is to hold regular meet-
Ings in all parts of the city to expose
all tricks of impostors, for the purpose
of convincing the most firm believers
that they are being systematically
swindled.

Thomas Crowley, the launch mag
nate, has returned from a visit to Port

Uricsol,
the only eyre for
Rheumatism.
If you are suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do It quickly if you
will lay side your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Uricsol cures rheumatism in the
only possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver and bowels and thus
drives them from the system.
). Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body.

SENATE'S WORK
LEFT UNDONE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, March 18.â Leaving
undone the main thing for which it
was called in extraordinary session, the
Senate adjourned sine die at forty
minutes past three o'clock this after
noon.
The President's great desire was that
the Santo Domingo treaty should be
ratified. All hope of this waa aban
doned a week ago and since then the
Senate has only been marking time.
During the last hours to-day the treaty
was hardly mentioned and the Senate
simply drifted out. The treaty went
over without any action whatever and
is still pending, but wfll never be rati
fied. Nor was there any provision for
an investigation in Santo Domingo by
a commission. This also, was given
up and no action was taken by resolu
tion. The condition of affairs is pre*
cisely the same as existed before the
unfortunate treaty was sent in except
that the non-action by the Senate indi
cates its disapproval of the adminis
tration's proposed debt collection cam
paign among South American nations.
NEW YORK, March 18.â Athole B.
Reader and his wife, mentioned by
Senator Morgan of Alabama in the
Santo Dominican treaty discussion as
composing the Reader syndicate, which
had in hand a plan for raising the
debts of the Dominican republic and
the sale of a naval port on the island
to the American Government, are in
this city. In a long statement issued
by the Readers they set forth their
scheme for relieving the Santo Domin
go situation, which fell through when
Commander Dillingham arrived on the
scene. They claim to have been en
gaged by Perez, a secret agent here of
President Morales. Reader asserts that
President Morales appointed Mrs.
Reader fiscal agent of the republic in
the United States and gave her author
ity to negotiate treaties Tor the debt
settlement in WashingOn, as well as
the entire financial rehabilitation of
Santo Domingo. These matters had,
the Readers claim, almost reached a
conclusion when President Morales an
nounced he had received word through
Minister Dawson that Commander Dil
lingham was coming and all negotia
tion with Reader was instantly
dropped.

It was learned to-night that an ap

the District Court oi Neosho County
for a receiver for all the property of
the Prairie Oil and Gas Company
(Standard) in Kansas. The suit will
be brought by independent oil pro
ducers. The court will be asked to en
join the company from removing its
pipes connecting with the wells owned
by the petitioners.
The receivership case will be based
upon the refusal of the company to ac

offered the company oil for shipment,
which was declined.

MINE EXPLOSION
KILLS TEN MEN
CHARLESTON. W. Va., March 18.â
An explosion occurred at the mines ot
the New River Smokeless Cool and
Coke Company at Rush Run at 19
o'clock to-night In which ten men were
killed. The explosion was in the Rush
Run mine. It extended to*the Red
Ash mine, nearly two miles away, and
great flames burst out of the mouths
of both mines. There were about five
men in each mine, who stayed there
at night to take care of the mines, and
all were killed. The Interior of ths
mines are in such a state at this time
that it is impossible for any one to
enter to Investigate.
The Rush Run and the Red Ash
mines are the property of the same
company and the latter is the mine in
which forty-six lives were lost three
years ago. It is impossible at this
time to ascertain the cause of the ex
plosion.

"1 am a pioneer. I came to California when
San Francteco was a village, and I have lived
in elrht of the place ever since. I own some
good real estate in San Francisco and (or (ourâ {
teen years I was postmaster at Colma, Just out- !
side of the city. I believe that among people
wha know me my word Is considered as good '
as my bond. I believe that when 1 make a i
fct&tement all my friend*? will believe the truth 1
of that statement implicitly. 1 was cured of
a serious came of rheumatism that was not only ,
painful, but it was becoming dangerous, be-
cause 11 was getting near to my heart. I was |
cured quickly and cheaply by the Electro- i
ChÂ«mic treatment, and I am clad to make this i
public announcement of my cure. I believe ;
that it will be the meant of Influencing . other 'â 
sufferers to take up a treatment which will
prove Â«juick!y curative at a email cost and at '<
the same time save the 6ufterer doting with
etrong medicines, which In the majority of i
V? B**8 ** a Â° em no good. My name la Jacob !
Bryan and ray postoffice address is Colma, Cal.. j
and the picture accompanying this article Is 1
a. good likeness of me. I have recommended !
many of my friend* suffering from different
ailments to take up the Electro-Chemlc treat-
ment, and every one who has taken the treat-
ment upon my recommendation has bÂ«rn Just â¢
as satisfactorily treated as myself."
The Electro-Chemie treatment is a com-
bination of electricity and chemistry which is
curative because it attack* the disease at its i
foundation, which In the majority of Instances !
is. In the blood. Electro-chemistry . oxygenizes ;
the blood, builds up the red blood, relieves
congestion and strengthens the general circu- â 
lation. The fact that It does this explains why
. it cure* rheumatism, even in its worst stages, i
quickly and permanently. The rheumatic
jxÂ»iÂ«">n is thrown out of the system, and this
makes the Electro-Chemlc cures permanent. |
ThiÂ« also explain* why it Is curative In catarrh.-
asthma, bronchitis nd - consumption. The â 
gprme of these diseases cannot live in the !
rÂ»tient'Â» blood '.which has been oxygenized by 'â¢
Electro-Chemistry. When the germ Is destroyed I
cf course, the patient gets well. It Is" the only ]
treatment knetrn to science that Ib absolutely
fermicide. In diseases peculiar to women there â 
Is always a great congestion of all of the pel- *
vie orr&ns. and as a result of thin congestion
there is inflammation. Irregularities, bearing-!
*cw n tensatioos. pain in the back, nervous- r
ness, etc., etc. As Electro-Chemistry relieves ;
a.! congestion, it cures these serious cases i
Quickly and permanently and takes the place- 1
of the surgeon in many cases. In diseases of
the Ftorr^ch. liver and bowels, Electro-Chem- !
Irtry is marvelously curative and cures dye- '
repel*. Indigestion, constipation, gallstone.
jaundice, cancer of the stomach, etc., etc In '
diseases of men there it no treatment that
cures weakness. Prostatiti*. Inflammation of ;
the bladder, enlarged prostate, stricture var!- 1
cocele, specific blood poison, etc., etc', like
Electro-Chemistry, and the reason of the suc-
cess of Electro-Chemistry in these bad condi- i
lions is simply because it goes directly to th>
foundation of the trouble, and In doing so pro- â 
o-jces direct effects, thus making the cures (
cuiek, permanent and inexpensive In all cases â 
consultation and examination is free. There are !
separate and private apartments set aside for
the a^caramedation of male and female patients
The E'.ectro-Chemlc practice in three years'"
time has grown to be the largest special medi-
cal practice in San Francisco, simply because
it has stood the test and has proven to be the
moet reliable. The treatment is mild, pleasant
painless and absolutely harmless. The Electro- '
Chemic home treatment is very successful and
-some of the best cures have been accomplished
by this method. Persons living at a distance
who can come for personal examination should
do 60. but when this is impossible a short de- ;
wription of the principal symptoms can be :

HAY SUFFERS
FROM NERVE
EXHAUSTION
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN
HAT, WHO IS SUFFERING FROM
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
NEW YORK. March 18.â Secretary of '
State Hay was taken ill to-day as he !
was about to board the White Star ,
liner Cretic for a voyage to the Mcd- ,
iterranean and became so weak that
he was taken on board the steamer in
a wheel chair. That his condition was
not regarded as alarming seemed ap- :
parent, however, as the steamer start- :
ed on her voyage without delay.
At the White Star dock there are sev- j
eral flights of stairs leading to the sec- :
ond floor, from which floor the steam
ship is boarded. In going up these
stairs Hay had to rest at each landing.
Just as he reached the top he reeled
back, but recovered himself and went
on. As he was about to start up the
gang plank he was seen to turn deathly
white and stagger and he would have
fallen had a friend not supported him.
The Secretary was assisted to a heap
of freight piled upon the dock near the
sang pUnk, where he sat down and
waited until an invalid's chair was
brought. He was then wheeled aboard
the steamship and went at once to his
apartments. â¢ . ,
As ghe passed Sandy Hook the Cretic
displayed a signal that Secretary Hay
was much better.
WASHINGTON, March IS.â"Ex
treme exhaustion of the nerve centers,
brought on by overwork,"' is the cause
assigned by the surgeon general of the
navy, who is Secretary Hay's physician, â 
lor the Secretary's collapse just before
boarding the steamship at New York.
The surgeon general had received no .
message from the family, but from his
knowledge of the Secretary's illness ;
he was confident the fainting spell was
due to this cause.
"Secretary Hay is worn out from !
overwork," the surgeon general said, '
'and I have urged him to take this
trip in the hope that the sea voyage
and separation from official business
will restore his strength. The country
does not begin to know of the work the
Secretary hae insisted upon doing, de
spite several attacks of la grippe and
bronchitis. As a result his nerve cen
ters are well nigh exhausted. I am
hopeful that two months of absolute
lest will restore him to health and
enable him to return to his official '.
duties."
To Begin Wf>rk of Tree Planting.
SANTA BARBARA, March 18. â
Agents of the Forestry Bureau of the
Department of Agriculture arrived
here to-day and announced that a tree
planting station will be established
here at once. The station vill be lo
cated 1500 or 2000 feet above sea level
and will be for propagating trees for
reforesting the Santa Ynez range of
this section. When the site is selected
the work of erecting the necessary
buildings will begin, probably within
a week.

Curcd_of Piles
After Suffering More Than Twenty-
Five Years.
TRIAL PACKAGE MAILED FREE.
Tntil about two years ago I had
had piles for about thirty years, at
times bleeding and very painful. I got
a 50-cent box of Pyramid Pile Cure
at the drug store and used it and was
entirely cured; got another box in case
1 needed it and as the piles did not
return in clx months I gave the rem-
edy to a friend of mine who wanted
the doctor to operate to cure him. My
friend said he would use the "pyra-
mids," but he knew they would do
him no good; but they cured him of
piles of twenty-five years' standing. I
am free from piles to-day and have
been 6lnce using Pyramid Pile Cure.
I was captain in the Civil War." James
Adams, Soldiers' Home, Cal.
The majority of people labor under
the impression that an operation 1b nec-
essary in severe cases of pile* or hem-
orrhoids, and are very skeptical re-
garding the remedial virtues of any
medicinal compound. Testimony like
the above should certainly have a tend-
ency to dispel this impression, although
it is odd that such a fallacy should
prevail, and still more odd that so
many people should think an operation
effects a permanent cure, whereas the
contrary is more often the case.
Just send your name and address to
Pyramid Drug Co., 370 Main St., Mar-
shall, Mich., and receive free by re-
turn mall the trial package in a plain
wrapper. Thousands have been cured
in this easy, painless and inexpensive
way ln the privacy of the home. No
knife and its torture. No doctor and
hie bills.
All druggists, 60 cents. Write to-
day for a free package.

GRATErgUTg.
THE SIMPLE LIFE.
Ways That Are Pleasant and Paths
That Ai"e Peace.
It is the simple life that gives length
of days, serenity of mind and body and
tranquillity of soul.
Simple hopes and ambitions, bounded
by the desire to do good to one's neigh-
bors, simple pleasures, habits, food and
drink.
Men die long before their time be-
cause they try to crowd too much into
their experiencesâ they climb too high
and fall too hard. A wise woman
writes of the good that a simple diet
has done her:
"I have been using Grape-Nuts for
about six months. I began rather spar-
ingly, until I acquired such a liking for
it that for the last three months I have
depended upc-n it almost entirely for
my diet, eating nothing else whatever
but Grape-Nuts for breakfast and sup-
per, and I believe I could eat it for din-
ner with fruit and be satisfied without
other food, and feel much better and
have more strength to do my house-
work.
"When I began the use of Grape-
Nuts I was thin and weak, my muscles
were so soft that I was not able to do
any work. I weighed only 108 pounds.
Nothing that I ate did me any good. I
was going down hill rapidly, was ner-
vous and miserable, with no ambition
for anything. My condition improved
rapidly after I began to eat Grape-
Nuts food. It made me feel like a new
woman; my muscles got solid, my fig-
ure rounded out, my weight increased
to 126 pounds in a few weeks, my
nerves grew steady and my mind bet-
ter and clearer. My friends tell me they
haven't seen me look so well for years.
"I consider Grape-Nuts the best food
on the market, and shall never go back
to meats and white bread again."

BRAVE WOMAN
GETS DIVORCE
Travels Alone Over Deserted
Trail to Find a Judge
to Grant Her a Decree
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., March 18.â A dis
patch from Fairbanks, Alaska, says
that Mrs. Georgiana Place, a slender,
blue-eyed woman, rushed into that
camp yesterday after a lonely trip of
600 miles from Beetles on Koyukuk
River. A desire to be separated from a
cruel husband was the reason which
prompted the little woman to brave
the dangers of a long journey over a
little used trail. Her hardihood has
been rewarded, for a divorce was
granted her yesterday afternoon.
Mrs. Place started from Beetles with
four dogs hauling her supplies for the
trip. No one could be found to accom
pany her, and in the face of earnest
remonstrances from her friends the
plucky woman persisted in her de
termination to go to the nearest place
where could be found an official with
authority to grant her a divorce.
Mrs. Place was married in San Fran
cisco January 14, 1892. According to
the story told in court her married life
has been one of constant misery and
suffering. Mrs. Place will start back
for Beetles as soon as she has rested
a few days.

Mrs. Vance Alleges Thnt .J. H. Meyers
Caused Arrest That He Might

OAKLAND. March 18.â A strange
Story of persecution was told to-day
in the Police Court by J. F. Vance of
1377 Fifteenth street, who was arrested
yesterday on complaint of J. H. Mey
ers, who lives at 1363 Fifteenth street,
on a charge of neglecting his wife and
three small children. Vance says that
the reason of his arrest is that Meyers
is in love with Mrs. Vance and wishes
to railroad him to prison to prevent
his interfering with Vance's flirtations.
The strangest part of the case is that
Vance's story is fully substantiated by
his wife. Mrs. Vance says that Mey
ers is in love with her and for that
reason wishes her husband out of the
way- She says, however, that she in
tends to stand by her husband, who
has always been good to her and to
his children.
Vance was released on his own
recognizance and his trial was set for
March 2^.

WOMAN FACES
MURDER CHARGE
Mrs. Eleanor Koehn Is Held
to Answer for Killing
Her Husband Last Month
WITNESSES TELL STOEY
Defendant's Attorney Pre
sents No Defense at the
Preliminary Examination
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 18.
Mrs. Eleanor Koehn, who shot and
killed her husband, Edward R. Koehn,
on February 12, at their home, 759 Fif
ty-eighth street, must face a charge of
murder in the Superior Court, having
been held to answer to-day by Police
Judge Samuels. No defense was at
tempted in the Police Court, Judge A.
L. Frick, Mrs. Koehn's attorney, ask
ing but few questions of the witnesses
and admitting the greater portion of
the testimony without objection.
Only once to-day did the defendant
show any agitation, and this was when
Mrs. Amelia Kruger of 780 Fifty-eighth
street, who was the first person to en
ter the Koehn home after the shooting,
testified that the defendant had told
her that Koehn had killed himself.
Mrs. Kruger told of finding the body
of Koehn in a closet, and then said:
' I said to Lena, Mv God! what has
happened?' and she airewered: "He did
it himself. When he saw he couldn't
get out of it, he went into the closet
and shot himself.' "
At this point Mrs. Koehn, who had
during the examination been listening
with little apparent interest, called her
attorney to her side and whispered ex
citedly to him, seemingly denying the
statement of Mrs. Kruger. She quickly
regained her composure, however, and
throughout the rest of the examination
evinced little interest in the stories told
by the witnesses.
Miss Mollie Kruger testified that Mrs.
Koehn had told her that she was un
happy with her husband, but that
when a separation was suggested she
had said: "I will never consent to a
divorce. Nothing but death will part
us now." Miss Kruger said that Mrs.
Koehn had come to the Kruger home
on the evening of the Friday preceding
the shooting, after a quarrel with her
husband, and had stayed there that
night.
Policemen Crossman and Tobin told
of the finding of the body, lying partly
in a closet, with a revolver lying near
the right hand. They identified the re
volver and also the bullet found under
the body, and those taken from the
walls of the room. Captain of Police
Wilson related the facts concerning the
arrest of Mrs. Koehn.
Detectives Quigley and Kyte gave
testimony and the hearing closed.

WANTS TO GET A WIFE
Porter Who Kicked Himself into a
Fortune Loklnff for Some
One to Share It.
Julius Tout, who shares with Joe
Rosenberg an interest in $50,000 worth
of gold found in Will & Finck's old
store, wants a wife. Here are the re
quirements: "Age. 16 to 28; color,
white; housekeeping ability, 90 per
cent."
Julius is a youth who literally
kicked himself into a fortune. He
came from Sweden two years ago and
drifted into Rosenbergs employ about
two weeks ago. During the altera
tions made in the dry goods store he
camf across an old box that had lain
in Will & Finck's store.
Julius was dreaming of a happy
home when he stubbed his toe on the
box. Then he tried to kick the thing.
It fell part and rich placer clay fell
out of it. Now Julius can have his
vine and fig tree and bids are open to
damsels between the ages of 16 and 28.

MOTHER SEEKS
MISSING GIRL
Miss Hattie Emery Drops
From Sight and Her Wid
owed Parent Is Distracted
POLICE ARE SEARCHING
Young Woman's Week's Pay
Is Awaiting Her at Place
Where She Was Employed
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 18.
The mysterious disappearance of
Miss Hattie Emery, niece of N. K. Fos
ter, secretary of the State Board of
Health, has assumed a serious phase
and the distracted mother of the girl
believe* she has been foully dealt with.
The girl was employed in a local news
paper office and a week's pay she neg
lected to draw is still waiting for her.
It is more than a week since she has
been seen by her mother or any word
has been received from her. *
Mrs. Emery, the girl's widowed
mother, lives on Twenty-third avenue,"
East Oakland, and has appealed to the
police to aid her in her efforts to dis
cover the whereabouts of her child.
Charles G. Riley, a gardener of St.
James Park, San Jose, with whom the
girl has been keeping company, has
been heard from, but he says he has
not seen her since his last visit to this
city some two weeks ago.
Miss Emery is given the reputation of
being a careful and steady girl. During
the rainy season she has been occupy
ing a room downtown, owing to the
distance she had to travel back and
forth from her work, and it was some
days before her disappearance was dis
covered by her mother, while at the of
fice where she worked it was supposed
she was ill, although it was thought
strange she had not notified her em
ployer by telephone. Finally word was
sent to her home and Mrs. Emery then
became aware for the first time of her
daughter's disappearance. Miss Emery
is about 23 years of age and has more
than the usual share of good looks.

IRRIGATION EXPERTS
CONFER AT UNIVERSITY
Problems Pertaining to Work of Re-
claiming Arid Land Discussed by
Enthusiasts.
BERKELEY. March 18. â Irrigation
experts, some of whom are connected
with the Government's service on the
coast and others who are university
Instructors, gathered for a conference
on irrigation problems at the univer
sity of California this morning. The
convention was held at the request of
Professor Elwood Mead of the univer
sity, who is also chief of irrigation and
drainage Investigations in the United
States Department of Agriculture.
Informal addresses were made this
morning by the foilÂ© wing men: Pro
fessor Samuel Fortier of the Univer
sity of California, who has general
charge of all the investigations under
Professor Mead on the Pacific Coast;
Frank Adams, whose particular work
is solution of irrigation problems in
the Modesto district; Professor G. G.
True of Nevada, Professor O. L. Wal
ler "T>f Washington, Professor James
H. Wythcomb, director of the Oregon
State agricultural experiment station.
Professor Elwood Mead has recently
returned from Europe. where he
made an exhaustive study of the meth
ods of irrigation in various continental
countries. He grave his confreres the
benefit of some of his experience and
knowledge gained abroad during the
discussion of irrigation problems.
The assistance rendered the work
of irrigating the arid lands of the West
by President Roosevelt was referred
to by various speakers, the general be
liet of these men, to whom Irrigation
problems are more than mere theories,
being that with powerful friends at
court helping and with exact science
being applied to the problems, the
work of developing the millions of
acres of non-arable land in the West
is likely soon to be advanced beyond
the fondest hopes of the pioneers in
irrigation work, who began years ago
the task of reclaiming the great Amer
ican deserts.
Vereln Eintracht Gives Ball.

friends of the Verein Eintracht at
tended its masquerade ball last night

To Whom It May Concern: After treat-
ing with thÂ« beet physicians and specialists
fcr the past six years I called on Dr.
Wong Him. He made a simple examir.a- ;
tion by feeling the pulse and explained my
case fully. I asked him If he could cure
it. He said yet, in from six to eight weeks,
which I can truthfully say he did. The
physicians uerÂ« think him a wonder. Any
one writing me I will be only too glad and
thankful to answer. I can cheerfully rec-
ommend him in the very worst cases of
eczema, as my ease was known to be one
of the moet stubborn on record. The
X-ray was also a failure. I think Dr.
Wonjr Him one of the best doctors in the
United states and owe my future health to
him. Very truly,

amount of the claims, ar.d the damages
are owing, according to the arbitrator,
to a Jot of indigent persons. The im
pression here is that Great Britain and
the Lnited States have shown delay
amounting to indifference. It is
known, however, officially, that the
r-laims for $120,000. which were pre
pared by an American lawyer, are in
exce.es of the actual amount.
Germany has not made any propo
sition to the United States or Great
Britnin. but probably would accept
half th a amount of the claims if it
were offered. The sum of $25,000,
mentioned \tx an American dispatch as
bPing all the claims are worth, is
looked UDon here as a sort of barter
ing offer not becoming the subject in
controversy. The German Govern
ment has informed the United States
and Great Britain, as a result of nego
tiations that were begun March 1, that
she is about to make a Joint offer.
OFFICERS FRUSTRATE PLAN
TO RELEASE PRISONERS
Vigilance of a Deputy Spoils Plot of
Cliicaeo Felon* to Secure
Liberty.
CHICAGO, March IS. â Two men,
who gave their names as Frank Gra
ham and Frank Ludwie;. are under ar
rest, suspected of complicity in what
appears to have been a plan to free
prisoners from the County Jail.
As Chief Deputy Jailer O'Neill was
making a circuit of the jail to-day he
saw a man lurking in a corner on
the oppogite side of the street. O'Neill
called two jail guards. The officers,
making a dash, surprised the man
O'Neill had been watching and ar
rested him. together with a companion
who had Joined him. Further investi
gation disclosed a rope, to which was
attached a large hook, hanging from
an outside window on the third floor
of the jail.
The bars of the window had not
been tampered with, but there were
footprints in the soot and grime that
had accumulated on the window ledge.
The men could not give a satisfactory
explanation and were taken to the po
lice station.
TECHNICAL EDUCATION
IS NOT BROAD ENOUGH
So Declares University Graduate In
Advocating Plea for Greater At
tention to Classics.
CHICAGO, March 18. â At the an
nual banquet of the Chicago Alumni
Association of â  Brown University,
President William H. Faunce dis
cussed the present tendency of col
leges and universities to emphasize
what h# termefl the "bread and but
ter studies" and offered a plea for a
return to some extent at least to the
classical studies as the necessary basis
of a broad education.
"I went to one of the best technical
schools in the country and got a thor
ough education in electricity," said he,
"but when I g*ot out of school I could
not write a respectable letter. Before
I could fill competently the position I
now hold I had to take a course in
English literature, history and politi
cal economy.
"The ideal elements as well as the
material should be developed, and" this
is done to a greater extent in the
classical course."

WOMAN HAIR DRESSER
ENDS HER EXISTENCE
Mrs. Freda Koch Turns on Gas and
Dies in Room on Minna
Street.
Mrs. Freda Koch, a hair dresser
about 40 years of age. committed sui
cide by inhaling illuminating gas at
545 Minna street last evening. She
is believed to have beert insane when
she took her life. She left a note,
hastily scribbled in German and read
ing: AH the beds belong to me."
Mrs. Koch has occupied the room in
which she took her life for some
time. She wai seen to enter it soon
after 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon
and about one hour later other room
ers in the house detected the odor of
gas and notified the landlady. An in
vestigation was made, with the result
that Mrs. Koch was found in a dying
condition, with gas flowing from two
jets in her room. The hair dresser
had attired herself in her best dre*s
and the simple note was beside her.
The Coroner's deputies were called
and the body was removed to the
Morgue. The woman had no relatives
in this city.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know- How Useful It :Is <
in Preserving: Health and Beauty. .
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient i
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but |
few realise its value when taken j into â¢
the human system, for the same cleans- /
ing purpose. "\ \ . \
Charcoal Is a remedy that' the more
you take of it the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system. j
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables. â¢
Charcoal effectually 'â  clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the '
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic. ./. â â '?; !
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; It â¢
disinfects the mouth and throat from i
the poison of catarrh. \;. ; . i ;,
All druggists sell' charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best j
charcoal : and the most for the money j
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they ;
are composed of the finest powdered I
Willow charcoal and other ' , harmless t.
antiseptics in tablet form or rather lin â¢
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozengers. the charcoal being mixed j
with honey. . Â ... \
â¢ The daily usÂ« of these lozenges will f
soon tell in a much Improved condition
of the general health, better complex- \
ion, sweeter breath and purer t blood, '
and the beauty of it is, that no pos- J
sible harm can result from their con-
tinued use, but -on the contrary, great \
benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking " of '
the benefits, of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all !â 
patients suffering from gas in stomach ;
and bowels, 1 and to clear the complex- I
ion and purify | the breath, mouth j and \
throat; I also believe the liver is great-]
ly benefited by the daily use of them; â 
they cost but twenty-five cents a box
at drug stores, and although In some '
sense a patent preparation, yet \ I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in any
of the ordinary charcoal tablets." : j

"Words cannot describe the terrible Eczema I suffered with. It
broke out on my head and kept spreading, until it covered my whole
body. I was almost a solid mas? of sores from head to foot. 1 looked !
more like a piece of raw beef than a human being-. The pain I and I
- agony I endured seemed' more
y^^^^^tw^ than I could bear.
Mk |R$*jjfev ''Blood and pus oozed from the
P^i Wrmfjtk great sore on my scalp, from un-
m j& der my finger nails, and nearly all
i&^*$fa*>&. over my body. My ears were so
Â§|jlI^2Sp^ crusted and swollen 1 was afraid
\ig|||l â¢ . I they would break off. Every hair
*^Â» I in my head fell out. . I could not sit
)|||i|||^r / down, for my clothes would stick
'pi||||Â£^gV to the raw and bleeding flesh,
1 [Jif^jL^Il^L making me cry out from the pain.
V^^^^^^^^^g^ "My family doctor did all he
v^H IP jTE*jri^^r could, but I got worse and worse.
' <^P<p=|i & v/V My condition was awful. I did not
<SSPQ> & think I could live, 'and wanted
aS Â«&â  V &.J&S) death to come and end my fright-
' >C &S. t W{\ m^ ful sufferings. â¢
' "In this condition my fnother- .
-in-law begged me to try the Cuticura Remedies. I said I would, but
had no hope of recovery. But oh, what blessed relief 1 ! experienced
after applying Cuticura Ointment. It cooled the bleeding and itching
flesh and brought me the first real sleep I had had in weeks. It was
as grateful as ice to a burning tongue. I would bathe with .'warm ;>
water and Cuticura Soap, then apply the Ointment freely. I also }
took the Resolvent for the blood. In a short v time the sores stopped
running, the flesh began to heal, and I knew : I was to get well again.;
Then the hair on my head began to grow, and in a short time I was !
completely cured. But I kept on taking the Cuticura -Remedies, as
they did me so much good I did not Want to stop them.
"My cure was so wonderful I thought I would write you about
it. 1 cannot praise Cuticura enough. I wish I could tell everybody
who has Eczema to use Cuticura. My condition was so terrible that
what cured me cannot fail to cure anybody of this awful disease. If
any one doubts the truth of this letter, tell them to write to me.

TYPICAL HOODLUM COLLIDES WITH
LAW'S MAJESTY AND IS HURT.
Police Judge Mogan Speaks Some
Words That Conveu Warning.
DEFIANCE GIVES WAY TO HUMILITY
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Rudolph Neary, about 25 years of
ag-e and in both appearance and man
ner a typical hoodlum, flouted the
majesty of Department No. 1 of the
Police Court and was authoritatively
informed that he shall severely suf
fer for it. When he comes up for sen
tence to-morrow a six months' term
for malicious mischief will be ordered,
with such additional punishment for
contempt of court as Judge Moj?an
may consider adequate.
It was for hurling: a cobble-stone
through the glass panel of a door in
the office of the American Box Fac
tory, where he was employed' as an
extra teamster, that Mr. Neary was
arrested. Prior to committing that
offense he had struck the bookkeep
er, August Geiger, on the face, but
a charge of battery was not entered.
"What have you to say for your
self?" the Judge asked the defendant.
"Wot I've got ter say is dat dis guy
Geiger hit me fust," was the snarling
reply. "Ye wouldn't want me let him
git away wid it, would ye? Wot
would ye want me to do, anyhow?"
"I would want you to do three
things," said the court complaisantly.
"First, I would want you to behave
like a gentleman â if you could; sec
ond, I would want you to refrain
from displaying your innate hoodlum
ism in this court â if you can; third,
1 would, want you to abstain from
taking the law into your own hands
by striking any one who has struck
you, when you could just as easily get
your assailant arrested and punished."
"S-a-y, wot're ye handin 1 me â a
joke?" inquired Mr. Xeary, with
! leer that did not enhance his facial
beauty.
â¢ You will find that It is no joke
when you come back here for sen
tence." said the Judge.
Bailiff Mahoney returned Mr. Xeary
to the cage, which was fairly filled
with masculine dregs of society, and
Mr. Neary promptly and vociferously
protested.
"S-a-y," he shouted, "wotinell do
ye take me fer, a-shovin' me in
among dese bums? Lemme out of dis!"
He was let out and replaced before
the bench, where his swaggering and
defiant air was maintained until the
Judge promised to give him six
months on the original charge and
further incarceration for contempt of
court. Then he seemed to abruptly
realize that he had made a mess of his
position, for his heavy jowl dropped
and his impudent demeanor changed
to that of servility. When. he re-en
tered the cage he was meek as a lamb,
but the fellows whom he had desig
nated "bums" glared at him angrily
and moved away from him.
"They won't do a thing to him
when the ch*nce comes," remarked
Bailiff Hickey, who is acquainted with
the ways of Jailed vagabondage.
â¢ â¢ â¢
In one of Andrew Lindgren's pock
ets was found $10 10 after he had
been arrested for begging alms from
pedestrians at Clay and Kearny
streets. Judge Conlan asked him if
the coin represented his day's scrap
ings, but Mr. Lindgren suddenly de
clined to answer the question. The
two plain-clothes men who arrested
him testified that he whiningly drew a
piteous word picture of an invalided
wife and a bunch of helpless babes
seated around a flreless stove in a
dingy and sparely furnished cellar
while he â the husband and father,
who was unable to obtain other means
of providing food for his cold and
hungry loved ones â played upon the
credulity of a community that is no
toriously responsive when human
kindness is appealed to. His victims
were mainly women awaiting street
cars, because he could stand beside
them and Dour out his tale of misery
without as much danger of attracting
police attention as would be the case
if he were to stop them or walk be
side them. The truth was that he had
neither wife nor children, but was
simply an able-bodied professional
mendicant devoid of scruple and ap
parently possessed of rare frugality.
"I will sentence you next Monday,
Mr. Lindgren," said the Judge, "and
assure you right now that your retire
ment from business will be for as
lon* a period as the law allows. The
exposure of such impostors as you
may prevent worthy objects of charity
from being relieved, but at the same
time it has a deterrent effect on vag
rants who may intend to emulate your
miserable method of obtaining a liveli
hood, and for that reason 1 hope the
press will describe your offense and
announce ita punishment."
Ah You. the Celestial mender of
chairs, who was roundly berated in
Judge Mogan's court the previous day
by Mrs. Winifred Morton, a colored
matron, was discharged, the Judge ap
parently taking the ground that the
oral castigation administered by the
lady was punishment ample to fit his
misdemeanor, which consisted of the
smashing of a window of her domicile,
209 Shipley street. Mrs. Morton, how
ever, was not satisfied to let Ah You
get off so easily, for she declared in
tention of fretting him rearrested, and
then she loitered in the corridor with
evident intent to do him bodily harm,
while- he and his mulatto attorney re
mained in the courtroom until the
bailiffs compelled her to depart from
the Hall of Justice,
"Ah'll go wlfout shovin'," she said
to Bailiff Hickey when he raised a
hand as if he were going to enforce
his order; "but ef dat mis'ble chink
finks Ah'm done wif him he's mighty
maistaken." .- -N . . '-â , â . . '/% -.

Mrs. Lillian Dundon confessed that
she had a "hankering" for the life
from which she was plucked by the
young man who made her his wife
with intent to reform her. She was the
star danseuse of a Pacific-street dive
when he undertook his philanthropic
endeavor, and the comfortable home in
which he established her might have
satisfied a woman with a less luminous
past, but she found it impossible to
fettle down in contentment to the hum
drum of domesticity. That's how she
came to be arrested by Patrolman Joy
last Friday night while she was trip
ping a lively measure with some of
her former associates. She said she
would try again to be worthy of the
trust placed in her by an adoring
spouse, provided Judge Mogan would
dismiss the charge of vagrancy against
her, and his Honor promptly took her
at her word.
Charles Hoppe resided with his wife
and his mother at 1624 Howard street,
and he chagrined his better half by
giving to his maternal relative the
money necessary to carry on his house
keeping, explaining to the former that
his first duty was filial instead of
marital, and that he could easily get
another wife if death or divorce were
to make him a widower, but could not
get another mother. Stunned by his
logic, the wife said nothing just then,
but when he subsequently demanded to
know why she had neglected to cook
his dinner ehe said that if his mamma
was to be honored as the housekeeper
it would be unreasonable to deprive
her of the culinary duties pertaining
to the position. Unable to digest such
argument, Mr. Hoppe resorted to
violence, and beat his better half until
she picked up a broom with which to
defend herself, when he seized the im
plement and tried to wrest it from her
grasp, and in the struggle for its pos
session the wrestlers rolled to the foot
of a long and steep stairway, where a
policeman separated them and arrested
Mr. Hoppe. Judge Conlan continued
the hearing until to-morrow, as he de
sires to hear Mr. Hoppe's mother's
version of the domestic discord and its
causes ere he pronounces judgment.
Since the fall of Mukden there have
been numerous arrests of Japanese
celebrants in this city, although the
police made liberal allowance for the
exuberance of spirit conveyed to the
little brown men by Oyama's splendid
achievement. So long as they did not
permit their patriotic ebullitions to in
terfere with the happiness of their
neighbors they were let alone, and the

SUPERIOR MERIT.
Remarkable Curative Properties of a
Remedy for Indigestion and
Stomach Weakness.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, a prepa-
ration for the cure of dyspepsia and
the various forms of indigestion and
stomach trouble, owes its great suc-
cess as a cure for these troubles to
the fact that it ia prepared for disease
and weakness of the stomach and di-
gestive organs only, and is not recom-
mended or advised for any other dis-
ease.
It is not a cure all, but for any stom-
ach trouble it is undoubtedly the saf-
est, most sensible remedy that can be
advised with the prospect of a per-
I manent cure. It is prepared in tablet
I form, pleasant to taste, composed of
j vegetable and fruit essences, pure pep-
I sin and Golden Seal, every one of which i
I act effectively in digesting the food
eaten, thereby resting and invigorat-
ing the weak stomach; rest Is nature's I
cure for any disease, but you cannot
rest the stomach unless you put into it
something that will do its work or as-
i sist in the digestion of food.
That Is exactly what Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets do, one grain of the di-
gestive principle. contained in them will
digest 3000 grains of meat, eggs or i
similar wholesome foods; they will di- J
gest the food whether the stomach is
in working order or not, thereby nour-
ishing the body and resting ttie stom-
ach at the same time, and rest and
nourishment is nature's cure for any
weakness.
In persons run down in flesh and ap-
petite these tablets build up the
strength and increase flesh, because !
they digest flesh -forming food, which I
the weak stomach cannot do; they in-
crease the flow of gastric Juice and
"prevent fermentation, acidity and sour
watery risings.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be
found at all drug stores at BO cents per
package.

tolerence thus shown encouraged the
more imprudent of their number to
overstep the line of decorum so far as
to make their arrest essential to the
maintenance of law and order. Judge
Conlan had one of them, A. Saki. be
fore him on the charge of wrecking
Chinese stores on Dupont street and at
tempting to Jiu-jitsu the four police
men who undertook his subjugation,
and to-morrow he will be sentenced for
peace disturbance and battery. In the
court of Judge Cabaniss three of them.
T. Ide, S. Asaki and T. Akaski, were
fined $10 apiece for having routed
quietude from St. Mary street by their
disorderly behavior. All of them were
drunk when arrested.
George Lanszweert. whose wife and
pretty daughter, Bertha, have support
ed him in Idleness by keeping a lodg
ing house at 511 Mason street, was re
leased on $50 bail after he had been
arrested for threatening to kill both
of them by shooting, but when Judge
Mogan had heard the younger woman's
story he pronounced her father guilty
of peace disturbance and exhibiting a
deadly weapon, increased the bail to
$500 and deferred sentence till to-mor

Jane Wilson, a pretty young girl,
said she did not Intend to steal the
morning newspaper which she picked
up from the doorway of her nextdoor
neighbor, J. Maloney. at 492 Fourteenth
street, but merely desired to peruse
the death notices and was so doing
when the policeman arrested her. Mr.
Maloney told Judge Mogan that he did
not desire to prosecute the young
woman, so the case was dismissed on
motion of the prosecution.

LAST RECITAL
ADDS FUEL TO
D'ALBERT FEUD
The TV Albert feud still growa. Yes
terday afternoon, at the last of his
recitals, the pianist furnished a whole
magazine of ammunition to both
friends and foes. Eut every one went
to hear him. Those that disagreed
most violently with him on Tuesday
went again on Thursday, and were in
the front ranks yesterday. Those that
most loudly found his thunders
monotonous waited yesterday for the
last of them. Comically these pre
ferred to quarrel through three recitals
with D' Albert to agreeing with
pl< ase fill in the blank to suilâ through
one.
In fa.^t D' Albert is a pianist that mm
m being heard. You listen be
cause you must You listen â and here
is the rrot of th" interest â because
through all the hasry. restless, almost
insolently indifferent work you feel
there is something colossal, something
that if you wait !onc enough you will
get. something hugely -.vorth waiting
laal a.t th* root of the Irritation
- jjst thatâ that one feelg through
much of the programmes is the feel-
->crt will not give you
â what you wait for. He doesn't seem to
think it worth while. He seems to feel
that anything less important than M.
d Albert, the composer, or you does
not exist. Ard there you are.
; And then, absolutely and ridiculously
to refute tho?e. that, deny .him the*
sense of poetry, of reverence for the
composer, of artistic proportion, he will
give, as : yesterday afternoon, a. divine
bit 7 at lyricism like : his ' Schubert ' Im

Suit in Su|)erior ( ourt.

BTEBN*S L\TER\*EXTIOX
Why Dilhan of Ruling School
Did Not Leave This World
as the Doctor Predicted
Everybody in town who has heard
the story of Dr. Max : Rothschild ef
forts to coll. :< r an. account >f SKI.]
against Joseph DiThan for medical ser
vices is laughing over the incidents and
outcome of th^ litigation. ; Dilhan is
the manager and owner of a riding
school \ out * near Golden Gate Park.
Failing- health -impelled: him. to seek
the counsel of a physician. Dr. Roths
child was duly called in, and his min
iâln I [ill ill to the patient embraced a
peri d <sf nearly a year. It seems that
Dtlhan Rrew worse nitner than better.
Owin? to his sickness his business ran
down and became unprofitable. be
cause he could not give personal at
tention to the affairs of the academy.
Dilhan, whoÂ«e chief ailment was !
something in the' nature of loeomotor i
ataxia J was | told that medical science
could do nothiiig more for him. and '
that he might as well make up his
hnind to settle with the physician and
face the Inevitable. The bill for med
ical services had already attained th- >
magnitude of teT3, and Dilhan had no
money to liquidate the account. . Th~
doctor pressed him for; a settlement,
and, it is said, â â¢â â :â¢ put an :
attachment on the riding school. Dil- f
han asked for delay. assuring- the pbysi
Â«.ia.n that the c.^taie uouid te 50Â«>ct for
the claim. All the time he entertained
th* belief that he. was near death; but
hi particularly desired that his clos
ing days-'Shotrt'l not be clouded by the i
v.orr- aird vexations of a lawsuit." En :
his perplexity and misfortune* he went
to his friend, Jacob Stern, the guidin-r
genius of the house of L. vi Strauss
& Co. .;â 'â¢; '
Mr .^tern. who is a broad-minded,
warm-hearted "nan. such as was Lsvi
Strauss. - listened to Dilhan. when the
latter said: 'All I want is a chance tt>
die in pea' â¢â  My business now has run
down, and if th -. attachment is slapped
on I will- be mined. **
Jacob Stern promised to see the doc
tor, and kept the promise. He said j to
the physician:,^ "Be lenient with Dil
han. Do not harass him for a settle
ment of his acwjurLt; , .. Let him alone bo
I die in peace.. The estate :is good, and

â¢ii.es rendered to the.? patient for a
â¢ period *off many; 1 monthsi-and should' be
paid. Finding .thei doctor | inexorable.
Mr. Stern - made | this : proposition i _ "â¢." â¢. *"I
will tell you what I will do: ; If you win
not proceed against Dilhan and Â« -will
allow him to die in peace, 1; : WiU, pay
you $350: on aecuimt of â¢ ur-!d.Kr: and
you can collect the residue ' from - his
estate after* his death."' The proposi
tion was accepted by Dr. Rothschild.
and Jacob- Stem paid Coyer the sum
'of 5350, -..â 'â¢'-.- ':-â  â¢'-*": -. -. .-â 'â  . . ;:'.:â  ;;
- * No j attachment was ] placed-- on â  the
riding: school. Dr. Rothschild went his
way ministering to other patients,, and
Dilhan devoted himself , to the task of
making peace with the world and all
mankind. Incidentally. *he gave a". lit
tle more attention to the neglected rid
ing school than the academy had "re
ceived for some time previous and the
business picked up. Strange as it may
seem, after all that had been done by
Jacob Stern and the doctor to smooth,
the way- for Dilhan":* exit from, this
sphere, 1 the riding master did not die.
tn fact he gave outward and visible
signs of mending. To the surprise of
himself and \ his . friends his ", health
came back | and business at th- riding
school grew better by degrees. This
restoration- of health and renewal of
prosperity did not escape the observa
tion of the doctor, who went to see his
former patient to- demand a fell set
tlement of the account.
Dilhan claimed that he was immune
by reason of the payment made by Mr.
Stern. The doctor invoked the law
with the terror? of attachment to en
force the payment of |523. the residue
of the claim.
Again Dilhan sought the aid of his
protector and benefactor, Jacob Stem. !
When the latter heard of the physi- '
clan's attitude his wrath was stirred ;
to its depths. He resolved to fight in i
the courts and tight to the finish. He
retained the services of an eminent
and resolute lawyer. The battleground
waa in Judge Troutfs department of
the Superior Court. There the judg
ment was rendered in favor of De
fendant Dilhan. The contract between
Dr. R.othschiid and Jacob Stern, by
which the doctor received $350, was
held to be binding. Unless the dcci- ;
sion is reversed the doctor must wait \
until Dilhan dies to get the rest of the '
money. Meanwhile the business of the
riding school is growing better every
day. and Reuben H. Lloyd, who nan- j
died the case for Jacob Stern, and Mr.
Stern himself are convinced that
Troutr. is a righteous Judge.

TRAINS MOVING
IN SOUTHLAND
Railroads Are Beginning to
(t<4 in Shape After the
Big Wind and Rain Storm
SIXTEEN CARS DITCHED
Weather Is Clearing and No
Further Interruption in
Traffic Is Anticipated
LOS ANGELES, March 18.â The rail
road situation in Southern California
ha* greatly improved during the last
twenty-four hours, and all trains are
moving to-night, though somewhat be
hind schedules. The only mishap re
ported to-day was on the Southern Pa
cific coast line north of Santa Barbara,
where a southbound freight train waa
derailed and sixteen oars were ditched-
The line was cleared late to-day, how
ever, and traffic once more resumed.
The rondbeds of the various lines are
still very soft from the excessive rain
fall, but as the weather has cleared no
further interruption is anticipated.
Heavy Downpour at Stockton.
STOCKTON. March 18.â Since early
this morning there has been a heavy
downpour of rain, and there is no sign
of a let-up. Fruit men say that while
there may be fome slight danger to
prunes, apples and cherries, in most
cases the fruit is set and 1b past the
danger point. This is particularly true
as to almonds. Grain never looked bet
ter in this county, though from points
outs' de the county some rust is re
ported.
Rain Will Benefit the Crops.
SACRAMENTO, March 18.â There
was a heavy rain here and in the up
per part of the Sacramento Valley to

"While the precipitation has been
heavy, the streams have not been
swollen to the flood stage.

CORDELIA, March 18.â The recent
heavy rainstorm has had an injurious
effect on all varieties of fruit buds. The
constant moisture, together with cold
weather, has injured the cherry blos
soms. The apricot crop also has suf
fered slight damage. The only trees
uninjured are the almonds.
Streams Are Rising; Rapidly.
MII/TOX, March 16.â After a week's
storm the rain is falling more heavily
than at any time during the week, and
the indications now all point to an old
time southeaster. Streams are rising

ing to cry enough, the miners are more
than satisfied with the outlook.
Storm Visits Shasta County.
REDDING. March 18. â Another
storm is breaking upon Shasta County.
A strong wind is blowing from the
couth and rain 1b falling. The temper
ature is cooler and it is snowing in the

Reviving Memory of Brave Deed.
The gallant fight made by Captain
Cousins months ago when he saved the
steamship Queen from destruction by
fire at sea and protected his passengers
from harm, will long live in the annals
of the sea. Captain Cousins received a
medal and other tokens of appreciation
some time ago and tfce other day, in
Victoria, he was given one more testi
monial. Among the passengers on the
Queen were some from Victoria. Cap
tain Cousins is now in command of the
Senator. When the Senator, which ar
rived here Friday night, reached Vic
toria, a delegation of passengers who
were on the Queen when she took fire,
boarded the Senator and presented
Captain Cousins wi^i a handsome gold
mounted cane and an engrossed testi
monial retelling the story of that fa
mous fight against the elements.
There is still further substantial rec
ognition in store for Captain Cousins,
for to-morrow afteVnoon at 2:30 o'clock
the Association of Marine Under
writers will present to him a handsome
silver punch bowl as a mark of their
appreciation of what he did in saving
the Queen and incidentally in protect
ing the companies they represent from
a very heavy loss. The punch bowl is
an elaborate affair, bears a suitable
inscription and is Â«aid to have cost
$250. The presentation will take place
at the association's headquarters in the
Merchants' Exchange building.
Sea Smashes Her Rudder.
The schooner Sehome, Captain Mat
ison, which left here March 3 for Ma
hukona, returned to port yesterday
steered with a Jury rudder and gener
ally badly battered by the wave*
which accompanied a terrific south
easter which started March 11 and
reached Its climax early on March 12.
Thunder and lightning accompanied
the southeaster, but all went well
enough with the Sehome until the wind
shifted to the southwest. This stirred
up a terrible sea. Waves enveloped
the schooner, which was almost help
less owing to the fact that the fierce
blasts had stripped off much of the lit
tle canvas it had been possible to carry.
At 6 a. m. on Sunday, in latitude 28
north, longitude 136 west, a big sea
struck the rudder, splitting it in six
places. The rudder at the time waa
over from amldshipe about 25 degrees.
To ease the strain on the crippled rud
der the fore staysail was set and the
vessel allowed to run before the wind.
So violent was the wind that no more
canvas could be set until the following
day, when it was decided to return to
this port for repairs. A Jury rudder was
rigged and the Sehome came into port
late yesterday afternoon. During the
storm her decks were swept repeat
edly and cleared of everything mov
able. Boats were smashed and she will
require an extensive overhauling be
fore resuming her voyage.
Revenue Cutter Changes.
Captain J. C. Cant well has been re
lieved from the revenue cutter Golden
Gate and ordered to the Hugh McCul
loch. relieving Captain Rodgers. Lieu
tenant Dodge, temporarily in command

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1905.
ALL MAY HAVE PERISHED
Little Hope Remains for
Schooner Pearl or Those
That Manned Her.
THIRTY-SIX OX BOARD
Owners Here Receive Word
of Wreckage Washed
Ashore at Sanak.
From messages received yesterday
by the Alaska Codfishing Company of
this city there is little room to doubt
that the schooner Pearl, bound from
this port for Sanak, has gone to the
bottom and it is feared that the thirty
six men, fishermen and sailors, who
manned her, have all been drowned.
The Pearl left here December 7 and
should have reached Sanak by January
1. The fact that no word of her arrival
had reached here caused little worry,
as Sanak is out of ""the world in the
matter of rapid communication. It
was supposed that she had arrived and
her owners were looking for her re
turn with a cargo of codfish when they
received the first Intimation, through
yesterday's Call, that their * vessel
might have been lost.
Alfred Greenbaum, manager of the
codfish company, received a telegram
yesterday from Valdez reporting that
on March 10 the Pearl had not reached
Sanak, but that wreckage from the
vessel had been washed ashore on the
island beach. The Pearl's figurehead
and some new lumber marked as was
the lumber carried by the Pearl were
found among the wreckage.
In addition to her crew the Pearl car
ried a number of men to man the fish
ing station at Sanak. She waa com
manded by Captain Emil Soderholm.
P. Landing was mate and W. Tierney,
second mate. The sailors were A. C.
Bjornstad, T. Thamson, Hans Helding
and P. Jorgensen. Cook, Hans Spel
mann.
Fishermen: F. Hunt, William Spear,
J. Moran, John L*ee, Thomas Bathie,

Declereg, C. Anderson, John Vera, Roy
H. Foreman, M. Jacobsen, A. Zillltz,

The Pearl was a vessel of 83 tons.
She was built in 1886 at Benicia and
has made many trips between here and
the Alaskan fishing ports.
Mongolia Sails for Orient.
The Pacific Mail Company's big liner
: Mongolia, Captain Porter, loaded down
| with freight until she was drawing
more than thirty feet of water and with
her decks crowded with passengers,
; sailed yesterday for the Orient. She
would have moved into the stream
I promptly at 1 o'clock, but after the
gangways had been hauled ashore it
was discovered that General Agent Al
exander Center was still on board. One
of the gangways was replaced and
Center disembarked. The delay wag
1 short, but long enough to mar a record
for prompt departure and greatly to
: disturb the equanimity of the unwit
| ting cause.
Among the passengers for Honolulu
I were Mrs. W. H. Whiting and Miss E.
: Whiting, wife and daughter of Admlr
' al Whiting, who the other day waa
knocked down and seriously injured by
a Honolulu streetcar. Congressman
J. K. Kalanianaole, better known as
Prince Cupid, and his wife were pas

Memoranda.
Per Br ship William Mitchell, from Ant
werp Mar 17 â Came to anchor last evening,
Mar 17, after passage of 101 days from Ant
werp. After getting clear of the English Chan
nel light and moderate winds were encountered
until arriving at the latitude of the River
Platte, from where a continuation of strong
southerly and southwesterly gales ware ex
perienced till rounding Cape Horn. When in
latitude 57 S. longitude 70 W, a very heavy
NW hurricane waa experienced, the ship be
ing hove down on her beam ends for several
hours and mountainous seas making a clean
breech over her. Within a week two more
westerly gales of exceptional severity and ac
companied by terrific squalls were encountered,
the decks being continually flooded with wa
ter. After passing latitude 54 B. strong fa
vorable winds were experienced till latitude
24 N was reached, when a heavy southerly
gale was encountered, several sails being
blown away. From there fresh northwesterly
and northerly winds were met with and a fair
ly *ood run wae made up to arrival In port.
Per schr Sehome â Sailed from San Fran
cisco Mar 3, for Mahukona; had fine weather
and westerly winds till Mar 8; then baffling
winds from SE to SW until Mar 11 at 8 a m;
then a terrific gale from the SE, with heavy
thunder and lightning; at 2 p m gale jumped
to the SW and blowed harder than ever; thÂ«
only two calls set was a double raefed main
sail and forestay sail; at 2 p m the new
double-reefed mainsail blowed away and then
we took in the forestay sail; It blowed so
hard that no sail could stand the pressure;
the sudden change of the gala from SE to
SW raised a very high cross sea; the vessel
labored heavily, seas piling over the bow,
stern and both sides of the vessel with great
force, filling the deck, cabins and store rooms
with water and washing everything movable
from the deck. Sunday, Mar 12 â Violent SW
gale and high cross sea; at 6 a m a big sea
struck the stern of the vessel with such ter
rific force that it split the rudder in six dif
ferent places, notwithstanding that we had
relieving tackles on both sides on the after
tiller; the rudder wae 25 degrees over from
amidships at the time; In lat 28 N, lon 138
W (barometer at 28.70), to ease the rudder
and not lose it entirely, we set the forestay
sa.ll and eot the veesel off before the gale,
and decided to return to San Francisco for re
pairs; the gale was of such fury that wÂ«
could not set any more rail; at 4 p m and a
little less wind, the foresail was set; then
had SW squalls for 2 days, thence baffling
winds to jwrt.
Per Ital ship Amphltrite, from Antwerp. Mar
18 â Jan 17, off Cape Horn, had a hurricane
from the NW, throwing the ship on her beam
ends, shifting cargo; stove in several of the
boats: gale blew away sails and did consid
erable damage to the decks.

SPECTATORS GROW ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THE FOUR-MILE RACE AT THE OAKLAND TRACK
THORNTON STAKE HONORS FOR GRAFTER
â¢Bi*r Bill" Knapp Pilots Son
of Cicero in Faultless
Fashion.
VETEHAXO RUNS SECOND
Track Is Too Kiddy for
Horatius. the Favorite,
and He Tires.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Grafter, the 15 to 1 outsider, wtth
"Big Bill " Knapp in the saddle, cap
tured the Thornton stakes over four
miles yesterday at Oakland track. Far
from being a walkover for Horatius,
a* many had predicted, the climatic
conditions transformed things into a
-turvy mess and it turned out to
be the most exciting and spectacular
rscf in the history of the stake.
A heavy downpour of rain had left
the course a veritable sea of mud and
vhe weather overhead was gloomy and
foreboding. A four-mile race has the
came flavor to a Californian that a
possum dinner possesses for a colored
gambler, and an immense Saturday
throng gathered to see the big event
decided. And what an eagle-bird the
victory of Grafter was for the books.
There were only four starters. With
a fast track to run over Horatius no
doubt would have been a 7 to 10 choice,
but the rain had not added to his
r nances. After seesawing through the
betting, first one favorite then the
other. Horatius closed 11 to 10 and
Veterano 6 to 5.
GRAFTER IS PLAYED.
The odds about Flying Torpedo fell
from 10 to 7 and a straggling play cut
Â«he price about Grafter from 15 to 7.
The latter gelding arrived at 11 o'clock
In the morning from Ascot Park after
a twemy-six-hour trip in a car. Lee
Bl.ipingame, one of his owners, said he
wÂ»f ready and that the trip wouldn't
dull his speed. Then. too. a course at
the timber-topping game down south
had thoroughly seasoned Grafter to
rough usage.
For nearly three miles there was lit
tle to vary the monotony of the race,
little Barrett, astride Flying Torpedo,
cutting out the pace, with Horatius
and Grafter the closest up of the other
three. Suddenly there was an awaken
ing, for it dawned upon the riders that
the last mile had been reached and
the crucial test was at hand. Passing
the wire the third time around Flying
Torpedo. Grafter and Horatius were
*<a m heads apart and a muffled roar
signified the excitement under which
the crowd was laboring. Birkenruth
still had Horatius under restraint, but
the favorite cracked shortly after when
asked the question.
JOCTiKY BARRETT GROWS TIRED.
At three and a quarter miles Barrett
muld no longer be of any assistance to
Flying Torpedo, the litt'.e fellow's
strength having failed him. and Hora
tius momentarily showed in the lead.
At the same time Minder, on Veterano,
unable t<> further curb his anxiety, cut
and a* the iron horse passed Ho
ratius. assuming command, it looked
all over and a mighty cheer from the
stand told plainly that the smaller bet

proved hasty and ill advised, for when
the bend for home the last time was
reached Veterano seemed groggy,
while Grafter, rated along at the one
clip by Knapp, was gaining foot by foot
on th<> leader. Plastered with mud six
inches deep almost, Veterano respond

FAVOR ("TKS TAKE TWO PURSES.
Favorites, while knocking at the door
in the different events, annexed but
two purses.
Frank Pearce. a 6 to 1 chance with
Bell in the saddle, took the opening
mile run from an inexpensive hunch of
platers. The Ecuador gelding led from
start to finish, leading out J. V./Kirby
and Hungarian with considerable in
reserve. Carilee, thp post favorite, rid
den by Knapp. got away from the har
rier all tangled up and had no chance.
O. Chandler, who appears to have
been reinstated, had the mount on Red
Cross Nurse, favorite for the mile and
fifty yard selling event. The mare had
matters all her own way out in front,
parsing the judges three open lengths
before Esherin. Modicum did not get
away well, losing show honors to An
vil.
W. Davis rode his only winner of the
afternoon in the mile and a quarter
selling number. He had the leg up on
Dusty Miller and won in boat race
fashion from Flaunt and Inspector
Munro.
HANDICAP FOR NIGKETTE.
Walter Jennings' black mare NTlgrette
took the mile and a sixteenth handi
cap. The surprising part of the race
wap the showing made by the three
year-old Handy Bill. The colt ran
about three miles the day before, and
it was his stable mate Dr. Leggo that
was expected to shine. Instead Handy
Bill pmved the contender from the
start, though the black mare held him
safely enough at the close, and scor
ing cleverly.
Stilicho ran a good third. Andrew
Mack, which closed a slight choice over

THE SA.N KKAJMCiSCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 19. 1905.
the Wilson pair, Dr. Leggo and Handy
Bill, could not keep up with the leaders
during the earlier stages of the run
ning, never looking dangerous.
Everybody has claimed right along
that Celeres looked like one of the im
proving sort, but they were not pre
pared for the turn of speed he exhib
ited in the last race. Big Beach se
cured the play of the elite, going to the
post a 13 to 5 favorite. Tooman gave
him a thorough fanning, but didn't
land among the select three at the
wire. Before the club-house turn had
been rounded E. Walsh had Celeres
clear of his field and the colt came
home on the bit, five lengths in ad
vance of Sea Air and Cloudlight
TRACK NOTES.
Jockey W. Davis leaves for New-
York to-day. He rode many winners at
Oakland, and backers never hesitated
about playing his mounts for any lack
of action. His friend and employer,
Willie Harris, made many friends while
here.
Treubel and E. Walsh, two very
clever boys, departed for Memphis last
evening.
Last year Grafter won the Water
house cup at Oakland. His sire, Cicero,
was brought to California by Ed Corri
gan and was a crack steeplechaser
President Thomas H. Williams and
a party of friends left last evening for
an outing over Sunday at Shasta
Springs. They will return to-morrow.
Charley McCafferty has concluded to
rae? a while longer at Oakland and will
not ship his stock to Memphis right
away.
Mrs. Cora Eckert has disposed of the
sprinter Rector.
Isadore Rosenzweig, who passed
away at the Hotel Dorchester in this
Hty on Friday last, had a host of
friends among bookmakers and turf
men in general. Affable and courteous
to a marked degree, his early demise is
generally regretted. The remains will
be laid away to-day in Home of Peace
Cemetery.
In addition to making his move too
soon Minder used poor judgment in
keeping Veterano up po close to the
eaders or at least right in behind
them. If mud was what Al was look-
Ing for he received a bountiful supply

Sensational Finish at As
cot Park Track Between
Col. Kuppert and Fireball
FAST TIME IS MADE
Three Favorites Score and
Other Winners Are Well
Backed by the Bettors
LOS ANGELES, March 18. â The fin
ish between Fireball and Col. Rup
pert in the third race at Ascot to-day
was the most stirring seen here during
the present meeting. The horses ran
stride for stride for the last eighth of
a mile, both driven to the utmost by
their jockeys. Fireball, the even
money favorite, won because Dugan
proved to be a better finisher than Mc-
Daniel. The flve-furlong course was
covered in 1:00^4. Three favorites won,
the other successful horses being well
played. There was a big crowd pres
ent and the books probably broke much
behind the talent on the day. Weath
er clear, track fast. Results:

BLOOD POVEiCTY
The Greatest of All Afflictions, Breaks <
Down the Health and Invites Disease.
i Blood poverty, or Anaemia, is due to a lack of health-giving properties in the Wood.
Instead of being . rich, strong and pure, it has become infected with some poison or germ
which has destroyed the rich, red corpuscles that furnish nutriment and strength to the body,
and is reduced to such a weak, watery state*that it is no longer able to keep the systepi in
health or ward off the : countless diseases that daily assail it.
Every part of the body is dependent on the blood for nourishment and strength, and
- when this vital stream ;of life becomes impoverished and run-down, the effect is quickly
shown. The destroying of the > red corpus- . . 't .
cles takes the color and glow of health from health almost broken down.

HARD TRAINING
FOR BIG BOXERS
Johnson and Hart Are Leav
ing Nothing Undone That
Will Condition Them
BOTH AFTEE JEFFRIES
Winner Is Considered a Log
ical Opponent for the
Mighty World's Champion
It would be hard to find a more
evenly matched pair of heavyweight
boxers than Marvin Hart and Jack
Johnson, who are to engage in a twen
ty-round battle at Woodward's Pa
vilion on the 28th of this month before
the San Francisco Athletic Club.
There will not be two pounds dif
ference between the two big fellows
when they step into the ring. At the
present time Hart, who weighs 194
pounds, is just a pound and a half
heavier than Johnson.
It is claimed by the admirers of the
colored fighter that he is the cleverest
big man that ever donned the mits,
not excepting Jim Corbett. To offset
this advantage Hart appears to be the
more rugged of the two, and is, per
haps, a little stronger. The Kentuckian
li essentially an inflghter and is con
fident of trailing Johnson's colors in
the dust, providing the shifty black
fellow will stand to his guns in the
close-range fighting.
Both men are sparing no efforts at
their respective training quarters to
round into the best possible shape.
For a long time each of the heavies
has been craving a match with Cham
pion Jeffries and repeated challenges
have received no reply. From appear
ances Jeff cannot consistently overlook
the winner of this contest.
Aside from the fact that a meeting
with Jeffries will be a,n incentive to a
good fight the bout should be a spright
ly one for the reason that Hart, who
hails from Louisville. Ky., has as much
regard for a colored man as most
Southerners have.
Fred Landers and Toby Irwin will
fight a fifteen-round preliminary to
the heavyweight bout. The boys meet
at 133 pounds, weigh in at 5 o'clock.
The winner will take the entire purse.

CACHED BY A THIEF
Beceptacle Also Holds a
Deed Conveying 12 Acres
of Land in Heart of Â£otham
NEW YORK, March 18. â A deed
transferring twelve acres of land
within the bounds of New York City,
a mortgage and a will, both dated De
cember 12, 1780, and other business
papers running down to 1835. to
gether with a silver tea service,
knives, forks and spoons, six linger
rings, a pair of diamond earrings and
a pearl brooch, all Incased in a stout
tin box. have been found in the heart
of an old oak tree by woodmen cut
ting timber north of Lincoln Park,
N. J.
The property has been placed in
the hands of an attorney to await a
claimant. It is believed the box was
placed there by a thief years ago, as
no one of the persons named in the
papers is remembered in the neigh
borhood.
The will is that of Matthew Wea
thersby. It transfers to his sons,
Parker and Andrew, $12,000 in money
and personal property and tweh'Â«
acres of land on the island of Manhat
tan bordering on the Hudson River,
but which cannot be readily located
on present city lines from the descrip
tion in the deed.
The interior of the tree wm per
fectly dry and with the exception of
a slight coating of mildew the pa
pers are perfectly preserved. Squir
rels had made the cavity their home
and it was filled to a depth of sev
eral feet with nuts and shells.

OX ACCOUNT OF RAIN
The baseball game between the Chi

teams was declared off yesterday on
account of the rain. The big leaguers
arrived early in the morning: and were
ready for action, but the grounds were
so sloppy it was impossible to play on
them.
The teams will line up this after
noon at Recreation Park if the weather
will permit. Should it clear off in the
morning and remain reasonably fine
the game will be played. Joe Corbett

! how many cars would be available for to-mor
row's auction sale., but it " was thought that

FOR ALAMEDA
Statement From Miss Benier
Expected to Facilitate
the Work of Detectives
WILL ARRIVE TUESDAY
)Jr*. Stanford's Remains Not
to Bo Taken Ashore Until
steamship is at Dock
' The steamship Alameda. bearing
the remains of Mrs. Stanford and the
accompanying party ' from Honolulu,
will arrive in San Francisco on Tues
day if the heavy storms at sea do not
Opset- the schedule time. Until the
return of Detectives Callundan and
Reynolds on the steamer it is not
likely that there will be any import
ant developments in the local investi
gation of the police. , :
There are many matters concerning
â¢which Captain Burnett and the Morse
agency desire information from Miss
Eerner, who was Mrs. .Stanford's pri
vate secretary. The other members
of the- household, who are available
here, ruive been" questioned very thor
oughly and on some of the strange
conflicts of statement it is hoped to
get additional light from the secre
tary, who knows more of the private
iife* of Mrs. Stanford than does any
other person.
No definite arrangements have been
made as yet as to Che disposition of
the body on arrival. Collector of. the
Port Stratton has offered the use of
the Government tug Golden Gate, that
the remains may be hurried ashore.
But it is understood that those in
charge have decided not to take the
casket off the vessel until the Ala
rneda is tied at the Oceanic dock.
It Is iilso uncertain still whether the
bo4y will be held IB San Francisco or

HOI'KN MR*>. STANFORD'S DKATH.
University Trustees Add Their Praise j
for Her Noble Character. .
The trustees of Iceland Stanford Jr.
University met yesterday at the of- j
fices of Crothers & Crothers, in this j
city, and adopted the following, which '
was ordered spread in full on the min
utes of the board, engrossed and placed
In the library of the university: ;
The honored life of Jane Lathrop
Stanford is closed. After years of lone- I
liness and sorrow, of single-hearted '
devotion and sacrifice, she saw at last j
her beloved university fully equipped j
and endowed for its great mission, the |
noblest monument ever erected by pa- â¢
rental love. Her busy mind was still 'â¢
forming new plans and hopes for its
future when she met her death. Her j
name and work will live, and it is fit- |
ting that those whom she selected to j
maintain what she had built, and who
have been especially honored by her J
friendship and confidence, should pub- ;
licly declare their knowledge of her no- !
bility of character, her efforts and her
success. i
"In 1885 Mrs. Stanford joined with '
her husband in executing the founding ,
grant of the Iceland Stanford Junior j
University, in memory of their only J
son, whose name it bears. Her hus- j
Â» band's death in 1893 left the work bare
ly begun, and added to her grief the
crushing burden of responsibilities such â¢
as her shattered life had never known. !
She bravely took up the load. Her
strength and skill grew with her task !
and were equal to each occasion. !
"Wise, steadfast in the strength -of '
God, and true.' for ten years she di
rected the business affairs of the uni- ;
fersity, planned and superintend
ed the erection of . Its build
ings and molded its academic pol
icy. She guided it through crippling
legal entanglements, through, embar
rassing internal dissensions and
through dark days of financial depres- I
sion when she sometimes sold even her
jewels to carry on the work. She lav
ished on it her private fortune, endow
ing; it far 'beyond its original 1 plan, and
opening to it unprecedented opportuni- j
ties of service. The work of the trus- ,
tees is made easy by the foundation \
which she laid with painful and un- ',
ceasing toil. _ I
"A devoted wife and mother, the '
loss of her son and then of her hus- 1
band did not unnerve or embitter her. i
but turned her affection -..nd activities !
into wider channels. The moving !
spirit of the founders of the univer- 1
city, as declared and manifested by
her. was a desire to render the great
est possible service to mankind. She;
made her gifts to the university more I
generous to enable it to offer instruc- ;
tion so nearly free 'that it may resist
the tendency to the stratification of |
society, by keeping open an avenue 1
whereby the deserving and exception- \
al may rise through their own effort
from the lowest to the highest sta
tion? in- life.' She made It really a
university by her wise ordering that
*while its chief object is the Instruc
tion of students with a view to pro
ducing leaders and educators in every
field of science and industry, it is also '
designated to advance learning, the
arts and sciences: and to this end the :
Institution should assist, by experi
mentation and research, in the ad

vancenipnt of useful knowledge and
ii! the dissemination and practical ap
plication of the same." She scrupu
lously required that "the university
must be maintained upon a strictly
non-partisan and non-secetarian ba
sis", but she also provided that 'the
greatest freedom of speech and action
consistent with this non-partisan
character be freely accorded to every
one connected with the institution.'
She often urged upon the trustees the
hones of her husband and herself in
founding the institution, 'not alone to
give the student a technical educa
tion, fitting him for a successful busi
ness life, but also to instill into his
mind Â«n appreciation of the blessings
of this Government, a reverence for
its institutions and a love of God and
humanity, to the end that he may go
forth and by precept and example
spread the great truths by the light
of which his fellow men will be ele
vated and taught how to obtain hap
piness in this world and in the life
eternal."
"In the unparalleled endowment and
successful establishment of a univer
sity wisely planned to fulfill these no
ble purposes she has done a service
not second to that rendered by my
< itizen of the State throughout its his
tory, and California should always
c herish her memory as one of its most
precious and ennobling possessions.
"The gracious influence of her per
sonal character and rare devotion to
high public duty have been impressed
upon the trustees throughout their of
ficial relations with her. They are re
membered with pleasure in this hour
of sadness, and must forever stimulate
and inspire all who are privileged to
follow her in serving the university."

DIRECTORS OP STATE'S
PRISONS IN SESSION
Will Open Offices in This City During
Improvement Work at the
Penitentiaries.
The Board of Prison Directors held
a meeting in this city yesterday and
transacted a large amount of routine
business. A number of paroles were
formally granted, the evidence having
been taken at prior meeting^, which
were held at the respective peniten
tiaries.
It was decided to open an office for
the board in San Francisco. There
will be much business for the direc
tors to look after now that extensive
improvements are to be made at the
prisons ac a result of the appropria
tions by the Legislature. Many con
tracts will be let and the incidental
duties of looking after the work will
entail the close attention of the board.
Offices in this city w^ill be a great con
venience to the members, for meet
ings must be held frequently and the
interests of the State will be subserved
the better when the directors can look
after the improvement work the more
carefully.

FINDS AGAINST
ELECTION BOARD
The demurrer interposed by the
Election Commissioners to the accu
sation of the Grand Jury charging
them with malfeasance in office was
overruled by Judge Lawlor yesterday
and the cases were continued for two
weeks to be set for trial.
The Judge held that the require
ments for election officers as specified in
the Political Code under the act passed
in 1901 are not within the purview of
the constitution, but simply refer to'
the fitness of the person for the of
fice. The qualifications in the consti
tution is the taking of the usual oath
before assuming office, as prescribed
by section 3, article XX.
The point that under the charter the
sole power to remove from office is
centered in the Mayor was not well
taken, the court said, and held that
the section of the charter providing
this did not interfere with the author
ity of the Superior Court to remove an
official for willful or corrupt miscon
duct in office. The section of the Penal
Code stood, Judge Lawlor said.
Attorney T. V. Cator then filed the
defendants' answers to the accusation.
It was pleaded that as the Mayor had
the power of removal and as he had on
February 21. found the defendants nol
guilty of the charges preferred against
them before him and decided that the
defendants should not be removed, and
that as the Mayor had prior jurisdic
tion, such proceedings, findings and
judgment are a bar to the prosecution
of the Commissioners pending in court
and to the jurisdiction of the court to
remove them from office. It was also
pleaded as a bar to the accusation that
it had not been legally found or pre
sented and that the defendants had
been compelled to be witnesses before
the Grand Jury and to give their tes
timony.
It is said that a writ of prohibition
will be at once applied for to test the
question of jurisdiction and the ques-
BELIEVES RUEF
BEHIND SCHEME
Foreman T. P. Andrews of the
Orand Jury Evidently believes that
Ruef is behind the suit filed
by Martin A. O'Connor and Thomas
f. O'Dowd to oust the Public Library
Trustees. The two were summoned be
fore him quietly last night and
asked a number of questions as to why
the suit was brought and by whom it
was instigated.
O'Connof and O'Dowd maintained
that they had brought the suit merely
in the interests of justice. Both pro
tested against being questioned, and
O'Dowd is said to have created a
rather stormy scene in the 'committee
room before he decided to submit to
the inquisition.
The following is given as the sub
stance of the questions asked of Mr.
O'Dowd and the answers given:
"Has anybody at the City Hall any
thing to do with this suit?"
"No."
"Have you agreed upon the fee that
you will pay your attorney, Mr. Daniel
CTonnell?"
"No."
"How much do you expect to pay?"
"That, is my business."
"Why did you bring suit at this
time ?"
"Because this thing has been an eye
sore to me for years.'"
Both men were asked if they knew
Abe Ruef or Mayor Schmitz. They re
plied that they did, but firmly aasert
ed that neither the Mayor nor Ruef
had anything to do with the suit
The cause of Foreman Andrews' in
vestigation is reported to be a rumor
that Attorney O'Connell had been
promised a fee in excess of any sum
that either O'Connor or O'Dowd could
afford to pay.
One of the significant questions ask
ed was whether or not the suit had
anything to do with the sale of th.>
library bonds. Both declared that it
had not.
Attorney O'Connell denies that any
body except O'Dowd and O'Connor are
behind the suit. He declares that he
expects no fees other than what he
may receive from them.
