IMPERIAL TROOPS AND REVOLUTIONISTS
BATTLE ON STREETS OP RUSSMN CITIES
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 29.â Blood flowed to-day in scores of Russian cities/ Everywhere the t^^ quelled rioters with
volleys, and full reports will show the number of dead' and wounded to , have, been enormous. The feeling grows that the dynasty is
tottering to its fall. The Socialists announce that civil war will be proclaimed at the end of the year.

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 29, midnight.â While the day
* passed quietly, without bloodshed, in the Russian capital, and
'while the city is outwardly calm, to-day's developments all indi
cate that a crisis is imminent. Although the streets are .filled
. with troops and reinforcements are no\v : pouring in from Fin
landj the Government seems utterly powerless to cope witlv the
situation and many -calm observers seem seriously to believe that
the present regime is tottering to its falL { ! :
Ti : -'' Differei)ces
General Trepoff, and while the precious moments pass the Em
peror; surrounded by the imperial -family,; remains shut up at
Peterhof, seemingly still hesitating as to what course to pursue.
Grave doubts are expressed as to whether the Imperial
Guard can, be relied upon. Early this morning the Fourteenth
. and Eighteenth equipages of the sailors of the guard,
. who have -been shut up like prisoners in barracks on
the Moska canal, demolished the windows and. furniture,
and in the afternoon a detachment consisting of fom
I officials of the guard went to the lawyers' assembly and
told the barristers that many of the officers and a large part
of the troops were disgusted with the Government and were
ready to enlist in the movement for freedom. They asked for
aid toward effecting organization and said they had discussed
among themselves the question of resigning, but decided to show
that men in uniform could help to achieve liberty. Even the
Cossack patrols in keeping idlers moving in the streets to-day
seemed careful to use their whips and simply drove the crowds
along before their advancing horses.
Deputation Presents Workme?i's Demands.
A meeting of the Municipal Council was. held this afternoon,
at which a deputation of thirty members of the strikers' com
mittee appeared. In an impassioned speech the leader of the
deputation presented the following demands of the workmen
and affiliated organizations:
"First, a constitution and political liberty.
â¢'Second that the city furnish food to the workmen. .
â¢ "Third, that the city refuse further supplies to the troops
and the police. . ; ; "*- '
"Fourth, that the troops be removed from the water works,
or otherwise the strikers would cut the water supply.
â¢ "Fifth, the immunity of the deputation from arrest."
The Council granted this last demand and promised to reply
to the other demands to-morrow. The Council sent requests to
both General Trepoff and Minister of the Interior Bouligan not
to arrest the members of. the deputation, but the police never
theless took them into custody. Upon urgent representation
General Trepoff an hour later released them. : ,'
The people are extremely nervous and bordering on panic,
and are easy victims of every sensational rumor. Among count
less baseless reports which received credence to-day were that
the Emperor had embarked on a vessel and fled to' Denmark ;
that General Trepoff had been "killed by a bomb and that Vice'
Admiral Birileff had been assassinated by mutineers in the Black
Sea. -\u25a0[>
Only One Cable Lt7ie Remains Open.
With a strike in the Government postoffice to-night com
munication -with the interior practically ceased. Government
troops were placed in the Government telegraph office, but only
a few lines are working. Many lines, including the land lines
to the Continent and to Libau, where they connect with the
cable, have been cut. At 10 o'clock, however, the cable by way
of Nystad, Sweden, was 'still open. This is now the only "thread
connecting Russia with the- outer world. Admiral- Darnovo,'
superintendent of posts and telegraphs, told the representative'
of a European power this afternoon that he could not tell how
long cable communication with the Continent would last.
The foreign embassies have discussed the situation, but
have as.yei taken no steps regarding the safety of foreign resi
dents. As a precaution the State Department in Washington
has. been requested to confer authority for the charter of a, vessel
and to hoist the American flag as a refuge for. Americans. /
J. Pierpont Morgan Jr.. and George # W. Perkins are'nego
tiating with the Hamburg-American Steamship Company for the
dispatch of a vessel to take twem off, if necessary.

DR. PIKRCE'S^REMEDIES.
?BAD! BAD!! BAD!!!
\u25a0 Bad blood comes from bad digestion â
bad stomach, bad liver, bad kidneysâ at-
tended with bad. 1 foul breath, coated
tongue, bad taste, bad headaches, bad
appetite and kindred symptoms. Bad as
these all are. and serious as are the dis-
eases to which they lead, Dr. Pieree's
Golden Medical Discovery comes to the
relief and cure of all these by regulating;
end invirorating STOMACH, LIVER,
BOWELS an* KIDNEYS, and putting
all these orjrans In good order.
\u25a0Golden Medical Discovery" contains
no alcohol, opium or other harmful
drugs; neither does it contain sugar or
*yrup, which arc injnrions to some stom-
achs. Without any of these it retains Its
pleasant taste and marvelous healing
quaJities in tho most trying climate.
Don't let a selfish medicine seller cheat
you out of your. health. by giving you a
substitute. He"s only looking out"for &
larger profit, not for your good. Shun
him. Honest, unselfish dealers recom-
mend the "Golden Medical Discovery."
"That roar remedies are not for tbo few,
but for the many Is evident, tor I personally
know of many scores of persons In this city
wbo hare been restored to betith and
strength by jour medicines." thus writes
Henry Ltr.dsheft. Esq.. Alderman In Kth
Ward. Buffalo. N. V.. of 1204 Jefferson Street.
"I know that Dr. Plerce's Golden Medical
Discovery Is most valuable In cases of de-
r&nfrmeat of the liver, harlnar taken the
medicine tome two rears eco when I had a
tyad attack of liver trouble, and I never nsed
a medicine before that did me so mcrh
food. I have known Dr. Pierce for twentj--
â¢tx rears, and do not wonder at his success
for ne Ik a physician acd man of sterling
qualities. Is possessed of extraordinary skill.
&nd he has in bis Sanitarium a corps of Spe-

unusual knowledge and professional sklil."
If fuflering from any'obstinateÂ».Hnger-

that Ehe was downhearted. It made. me
feel frightened and W I went to Lypn,
where the company was then playing.
"She had written that she was sick with
stomach trouble. I found that she had
sent in a doctor's certificate- to the stage
manager faying that she was sick. Mor
ris Xathan, a member of the _|Â£3herfherd
King* Company, and to whom she was
engaged, thinks the doctor's name was a
forgery, because no doctor bearing the
name found on the paper could be found
in Lynn or Boston."
YOUXG . NATHAN UNNERVED.
PITTSHURG. Oct. 29.â The local police
received instructions last night from Su
perintendent of Police Pierce of Boston to
apprehend Morris Nathan and find out
what he knew about the disappearance
of Susan Geary, his sweetheart, whose
dismembered body was found in the suit
cases near Boston. Xathan, accompanied
by Manager B. 'A. Remold, Stage Director
Samuel Forest and a Japanese, was' ar
rested after a search of several hours in
the Hotel Henry and taken to police
headquarters. Nathan insists that he has
not seen. the girl since he escorted her
to a eubway station on the night of Sep
tember 9.
Manager Remold and Stage Manager
Forest were taken to detective headquar
ters early In the evening from the Lin
coln HoteL They denied any knowledge
of Xathan' s whereabouts and after a long
session with Chief McOuaide were al
lowed to go. Remold and Forrest went
to the Hotel Henry shadowed by Detec
tive Cole. They went upstairs and Cole
secured the number of the room and fol
lowed. He found Nathan, Kimeo (a Jap
anese), Remold and Forest coming out of
a room on the fifth floor and placed
Nathan under arrest.
Xathan was unable to stand when he
learned that Cole was from detective
headquarters. He had been crying for the
past week and was so unnerved that
Kimeo and Forrest had to almost carry
him to police headquarters. Superinten
dent McQuade inynedlately called up
Superintendent of Police. Pierce of Bos
ton and talked to him owr the long dis
tance telephone a long time before re
turning to his office, where Superinten
dent Wallace, Detectives Cole and Kane,
Messrs. Remold. Forrest, Xathan and
Kimeo were in session. . Xathan was
overcome and it was with difficulty that
he repeated his story* of" his connection"
with the mystery.
GIRL GIVEN A GOOD NAME.
Kimeo, the Japanese valet of Wright
Lorrlmer, has been a close friend of Xa
than. Â». .Â«.-.\u25a0.
Josie Barron, who was a close friend of
the murdered gfrl, was located in Lacock
street last night, but "was riot asked to
give her story.
Manager Remold has the doctor's cer
tificate which had been received at Low
ell, Mass.. explaining that Miss Geary
was 111 and would be unable to join the
company for some days yet.
An expert penman declared yesterday
that the handwriting was that of a man
who had endeavored to disguise it. The
certificate was signed t by "Dr. P. A.
Smith." His address was not given, how
ever, and the paper was part of a letter
head, the printed matter on top haying
been torn off. "Dr. Smith" is believed to
be a fictitious name, but who it, could be
Xathan dÂ«Â»clared he did not know. He
said 'he knew of "no. doctors, medical
students or, other druggists who were ac
quainted with the girl.. He declared that
he had known her for over a /year and
that she was a good, virtuous girl.
The members of the company sympa
thize deeply with Xathan and believe him
innocent but are heartbroken over the
girl's death.
Miss Geary, or Durrell, as she was
j known on the stage, was a good-looking
j girl, but not of the strikingly handsome
*ype,. Her engagement to- Xathan ; was.
known to the other members of the com
pany. She was living at home, but mem
bers of the company say she was dissat
isfied, as her stepfather was not kind to
I her.

EXPERTS FILE REPORT
Find That Second-Class
[ Material Was \ Used in
Constructing Public Works
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29.â The re
port of the, Board of Investigating En
gineers, appointed last July by* Mayor
Weaver to. examine the nitration sys
tem of the city and the northeast and
the southern boulevards, now under
construction, which report was sub
mitted to the Mayor yesterday, was
made public to-day. It is signed by
Major Cassius Gillette of the United
States engineer corps, ; who investigat
ed .the Savannah harbor frauds, and
John Donald MacLennon of â¢ Washing
ton. D. C.
The report shows that -up to date
the city has* lost through excessive
costs, collusive bids, illegal advertis
ing and in other ways the sum of J6,
530.000. The contractors who received
most of the more than $18,000,000: that
has been expended on improvements
are D. J. McNichol & Co.. Jamil J.
Ryan & John A. Kelley> and Vare
Brothers.
The members df the McNichol r firm
include Israel W. Durham, leader of
the local- .' Republican "organization;
State Senator J. P. McNichol, also a
city leader, and the latter's brother,
Daniel. The Vare firm is made up of
State Senator George A. Vare and Ed
win H. Vare. Their brother. William
S. Vare, is Recorder of Deeds, an elec
tive offlce.
The officials held responsible by the
report for some of the; conditions in
connection with the filtration system
are W. M. C. Haddock, who was Direc
tor of Public Works under Mayor Ash
bridge; Peter E. Costello, Director of
Public Works under Mayor Weaver
until last May, when the Mayor dis
missed him, and John W. Hill, former
chief of the Bureau of Filtratlbn, who
is awaiting trial on charges of fraud
and falsification of records in connec
tion with the construction of the fil
tration system. The' report says: ;
Omitting- from construction all small con
tracts â say under $30,000 â we find that for the
filtration work and the two boulevards as con
structed up to date the city has paid or pledged
$18,761, 511. First-class workrwnder the specifica
tions should not have cost over. 112,430.000,
which Includes an allowance of 20 per cent, or
$20,705,258, for legitimate i contractors' profits.
The difference 1b $6,330,000. In other words.
$18.7ti0,000 In round numbers has been paid for
work costing the contractors $10,356,000.
Of the $0,330,000 excessive cost there has
gone to the contractors "who worked under the
names of D. J. McNichol $5,065,122. similarly
to Ryan & Kelley $543,800. and to Vare Broth
ers $59,128. Of the $15,701.541 there Is unpaid
about $563,000 to McNichol atld $75,000 to Ryan
& Keller.
, Much of the work done by Ryan & Kelley
and D. J. McNichol is not first-class. The
parts which show prominently to the public are
fairly well done; the' pans that can be exam
ined with little trouble.. are. distinctly second
class and not up to the spgrjifiqatlons. We^pf
course, do not know the condition of such por
tions as cannot be seen without tearing up
the ' work, but wherever we have dug \u25a0 Into it
we find . It second class' or worse. \u25a0' \u25a0
'\u25a0 Continuing the report says: ; ;
j A careful analysis of all the filtration adver
tising Indicates that' everything possible was
done to avoid any real publicity without let
ting the fact appear too prominently in the
records. The bureau's preliminary estimate?.
Instead ! of being freely furnished to bidders,
were rigorously guarded secrets, sp far as the
general bidder was concerned. , * .

Miss Curtis sustaining a double frac

WASHINGTON, Oct. 29âMajor*Gener
al F. C.V Ains worth, the i secre
tary,^ in his annual report 1 devotes much
attention 1 to^desertlons f rom â¢ the i army.
Of the canteen he states that those who
know how it came to be abolished are not
hopeful of its .* restoration. The report
states that there ls.no likelihood of any
such Increase in -the soldiers'- pay as will
offset the' greater Inducement offered in
civil pursuits. r The comforts and even
luxuries that are" furnished to enlisted
men in the service are even nowcritl
cized by some as being not only extrava
gant but Injurious in their effect on men
whose real business it is to march and
fight, incumbered with, few comforts and
no luxuries. The report continues:
Our people have little ' real Interest : in the
army In time of peace, and from;thÂ« earliest
day of . the republic have been accustomed to
look upon It as a more or less unnecessary in
stitution. Enlistment in the army in time of
peace Is not uncommonly regarded as evidence
of worthlessness on the pan of the recruit.
It Is safe to predict that desertions from the
army will continue to be excessive \u25a0 until there
shall have been a radical change' of public sen
timent toward the army and until the deaerter
shall come to be regarded as thÂ« criminal that
he ia, to be ostracised and hunted down as re
lentlessly as any other transgressor of the laws.
There Is no reason to look for such change of
sentiment In the near future, and there are
some. who believe that the change will never
come until our people shall have learned, through
national disaster and humiliation, that the ef
fective maintenance of an army of professional
soldiers is absolutely essential to the preserva
tion of the national honor and life, and that
the trained and disciplined troops of a modern
army cannot be withstood- D>- hastily organized
armies of untrained or half trained civilians.
The losses in the -regular army during
the fiscal year were: Officers killed in ac
tion or died of wounds, 24; resigned or
discharged, 20; dismissed, 13; deserted. 3;
retired, 59; total, 119. Enlisted men killed
in action or died of wounds or disease,
377; discharged upon expiration of term of
service, 22,254; discharged for disability,
by sentence of court-martial and by or
der, $3460; deserted, 6533; retired, 189. To

During the year 274 battle flags in cus
tody of \u25a0 the War Department were re
turned to the Governors of the States In
which regiments that bore them were
raised. There still remain 452 of these

that these Union flags be transferred to

that the , Confederate flags be given to

MIXTURE THAT DOES'
AWAY WITH MATCHES
Denver Chemists Unable to
.Analyze Their Dis
covery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Oct. 29. â Fred Cowell. a
drug clerk, and Charles Franzeen, hU
employer^ will make fortunes if they
can analyze a strange mixture which,
placed on gas mantles, makes them
light instantly when the gas is turned
on, without matches being needed.
Cowell made the discovery by acci
dent. The bottle " and its contents,
which are phosphorescent, were pur
chased at auction with a stock of drugs
by '.Franzeen.. when. he. first. t went,
business twenty years ago. The labsl.
on the bottle was blurred and Fran
zeen placed it on a top shelf in hiÂ» lab
oratory*
On Friday, Cowell- was dusting about
the laboratory, when .his duster struck
the bottle. . knocking tt from -the/shelf.'.
It fell on a ,gas lamp., directly under
the place It occupied on the shelf. The
: glass stopper came out of the bottle
and struck and broke the lamp and
the chimney. Then the bottle fell on
its side and a quantity of its contents
spread over the mantle of the gas
lamp. iJ^fv-
The accident occurred in the morn
ing and Cowell paid no attention to it.
When night came Cowell turned on tbo
gas and struck a match. To his sur
prise the mantle blazed without- the
match being applied. He turned off.
the gas and .the lamp went out. He
turned it on again and before he could
apply a match he found the gas burn
; ing.. He reported his discovery to
Franzeen and they have worked stead
ily more than forty-eight hours try
"ing to analyze the mixture, but \u25a0with
out success. They have found that the
contents of the bottle are a combina
tion of phosphorescents and other
chemicals, but the exact chemicals and
the component parts they have been
unable to determine. Both are chem
ists and know that if they can make
self-lighting gas mantles they j will be
enriched. Hundreds have seen the
mantles light themselves. r y : .-

who are keeping professors and students imprisoned in the in
stitution.
Sick Persons Deprived of Medicine.
Even the druggists have struck and as there is much sick
ness the police have divided the city into districts, and also have
selected stations for the giving of first aid to the injured in caseo
of collisions between the troops and the people.
Such news as comes from the interior shows no improve
ment in the situation. The Government everywhere seems
powerless to break the strike. After the Governor had formally
instructed the troops not to fire, and upon the demand of the
"Black Heads" at Reval, the soldiers were sent. out of that city
and the place left in charge of a local militia which had been
organized by the citizens. v
Â»â¢ Most interesting by far, however, is the news from Mos
cow, the real Russian capital, where, according to private reports,
I the Municipal Council and the committee of public safety are
sitting continuously and where a struggle is momentarily ex
pected between the "League of Russian Patriots," a reactionary
organization led by the priests, and the newly organized militia
and students. The Moscow Municipal Council is also reported
to have sent an ultimatum to che Emperor, demanding the pro
\ mulgation of a constitution.
Although it is impossible officially to confirm these 'reports,
they seem to admit of no doubt that the anti-Government forces
. have the upper hand.
The Government 19 no longer in communication with the
forces in the Far East, except by cable by way of China.
The situation cannot well be exaggerated. With the present
indecision of the Emperor the Government has neither a head nor
a policy to meet the crisis, and things seem to be drifting to
ward anarchy. The revolutionists openly declare that the Gov
ernment has ceased to exist and that nothing remains to his
Majesty except to abdicate. With a firm hand at the helm and
a rational policy, however, all might quickly be changed.
rROTECTIOV OF AMERICAN*.
P^fttete Department Cables Instructions
.Â« "to Spencer Eddy.
, WASHINGTON. Oct. 29. â The condi
.tkm of affairs In Russia formed the
basis of a dispatch received at the
State Department from Spencer Eddy,
the American Charge d' Affaires at St.
Petersburg, who said the situation was
tntfry alarming. The dispatch was the
subject of a lons conference between
"" e o Secretary Root, who returned to the
city from New Tork early in the even
Â£ e ing. and Mr. Bacon, the First Assistant
Secretary, who has been acting as the
head of the State Department during
Mr. Root's absence. Mr. Eddy asked
] the Department for further instructions
to meet jjjcyr-.e^erntuatlties which might
arise out* of "the condition of affairs as
they now exist in St. Petersburg, and
late in the evening these were cabled
to^ him. *
One feature " o* these Instructions
I covers the question of protection of
Americans residing In St. Petersburg
in case of a general rising which might
endanger their lives. In the event of
an outbreak they will be accorded the
protection of the American Legation
until further arrangements can be made
foi their accommodation, if such be
found necessary. It is not believed by
the State Department officials that
there is any erreat number of Americans
sow in St. Petersburg, as most of the
\u25a0 tourists have left the country In antici
opation of the winter season. Such a*
may be in the interior it Is thought are
not in any danger. ~'U-'.
The chartering of a vessel and the na-
J^tlonÂ£llzing of U by hoisting an Ameri
-^tcan flag, to provide a refuge for Ameri-
Icans is rether an unusual proceeding and
\u25a0 Is not resorted to excejjt In cases of
Â« extreme emergency, the State Depart
ment generally relying on the asylum af
forded by the Embassies and Legations
o as adequate in the premises. The â¢ offi
cials hope that such a step will not be
necessary, .but that the' disorders will
soon quiet down and the safety of Ameri
oans thereby be assured.
In diplomatic circles the news from
Russia during the past few days has
caused a itrofound impression. Those
conversant with existing conditions In
Butsia were prepared to hear at any time
of disorders growing out of the unsettled
Â° conditioa of affuirs there, but they are
0 â ttmazed that they should have grown to
Buch magnitude and got almost beyond
the contrql/of the. government. While
member's of* the diplomatic corps .are not
disposed to publicly make any expression
of their views, it Is evident they view
with deeo concern the events now oc
curring ih the Czar's empire.
Baron Rosen, the Russian Enibassador,
read with great Interest the press dis
patches coming from various parts, of
Russia to-night. He would not discuss
the news, except to say that he thought
theÂ«d'sorders soon would cease and the
1 , strike break up gradually.

A train arrived to-night from Ger
many in charge of a railroad bat
talion, having been four days cover
ing the distance from the frontier.
Many meetings were held to-night in
various quarters of the city, at which
the workmen, encouraged by the suc
cess of the movement, were in a
jubilant and confident spirit. The bet
ter classes, as a rule, are keeping
closely to their houses.
The Government and the Liberals are
at a loss to know whose Is the contriv
ing brain behind the great -strike. The
directing hand is invisible, though its
workings are plainly evident. It is
thought the strike may have been di
rected from Switzerland or Germany
and executed here through the Social
Democratic organizations, in which
representatives of the workmen and the
students are equally active. The or
ganization is able to', sway the great
student body through its student mem
bers and everj-where to-day the stu
dents,, were seen mingling with the
workmen and taking an active part in
their movement.

has seen his mother but once in the

has frequently urged her to come and
make her home with him. She stead
ily refused, however, disliking to leave
her old home. \u25a0
Finally, with all her children g'fown
up and married, the loneliness told on
her so that she had to come. She had
hardly landed, however, when she was
taken sick and Mello was telegraphed
for. He will take his mother to Cali

the "Worst Wreck on

PITTSBURG, Oct. 29.â The Post to-mor
row will say: If every penny of the 100
per cent assessment against the stock of
the Enterprise National Bank Is paid, the
depositors will not get more than 10 cents
on the dollar. That Is the opinion of the
Government officials at Washington, to
whom the corps of Federal experts who
are at work at the bank here have re
ported.
Startling facts as to the extent of the
failure have developed. The department
officials brand lt as the "worst wreck on
record." Not only does it appear that
every asset of the institution was bor
rowed or stolen, but that through the re
hypothecatlon of notes and securities, the

LONDON, Oct. 30. â The Daily Tele
graph's St. Petersburg correspondent,
telegraphing to-night, says:
"I Bin Informed that the Emperor has
just accepted the Liberal : programme,
appointed Count de Wltte Premier and
given legislative powers to tnt- repre
sentative assembly,, allowing represent-,
atlves from all sections of tin; popu
lation to be elected to lt and abolish
ing: martial lan* throughout (he em
pire. I am further informed that the
Kmperor will Issue a manifesto to the
people to-morrow."
In earlier dispatches the Daily Tele
graph's correspondent described the
autocrats as like "a "bulb of mercury
fallen from a height and shivered into
little pieces," and Russia as having be
come an "archipelago of political
islands, each independent of the others,
all dealing with public affairs with
hardly any reference to the will of the
once all-powerful monarch."
"Anti-monarchical sentiments," ;the
correspondent goes on to say, "which
would have been a- terrible crime two
months ago, are now in everybody's
mouth. The Russian people, , suddenly
educated by events and Sobered by a
sense of responsibility, is able, .willing
and determined henceforth to manage
its affairs in its own way and with
out interference from above.
"My belief is that it the authorities
abstain from violence the strike will
terminate next week* because the So
cialists are waiting till the md of the
year for an armed insurrection^ when
they will be fully prepared."
A dispatch to the Standard fro ni Odes

' "A ! collision betweri ' the miltary j. and" a*
crowd of students and strikers occurred
an hour ago in Tyraspoloskaya; street.
The soldiers without warning tired point

wounding sixty. The students are hold
ing a stormy conclave at the university.
â¢*It is reported from Kieff that three
regiments have mutinied In the ; South
western provinces and there are alarming
reports hereo f the doubtful fidelity of
three battalions of infantry. ;.
. "I have had an interview with Gen
eral Kaulbars, commander-ln-chiel ; of the
Odessa military district, who said that
the situation was a grave one, but that
he did not yet consider himself warranted
in asking the authorities to again impose
martial law. His great fear appears -to
be that a general attack would bo made
on the Jews, _ in which case, he said,
he would use all the forces at his com
mand for their protection.
"Subsequently, I saw the civil-Gover
nor, who seemed to-be more nervous
about the situation, but who declined to
discuss it."
The Daily Chronicle's correspondent
at St. Petersburg sends the following:
"The court is in revolt against the
Emperor, who is vacillating between
the counsels of his Ministers to \ grant
a constitution, with Count de Wltte as
Premier, and the advice of the reaction
aries to proclaim a dictatorship iunder
General Count Alexis .Ignatieff, a; mem
ber of the Council of the Empire.'
"One of the most - ominous factors
in .the situation is the feeling among
the Finns. There are only 4000; trooj>s
in Finland, the 6000 reservists* sent
there having been brought back be
cause they developed revolutionary
leanings. Should the Finns revolt, the
Government could not reinforce the
garrisons, because every soldier Is
wanted, here and the navy is unreli
able." . ; .- vO-; : .V;' : :".'

Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
CLINTONVILLE. Wls.. Oct. 29.â The
publication In the San Francisco Call of
the story of the attempted suicide there
of Mrs. F. A. Seaman has solved a mys
tery which the local authorities tried in
vain to clear up two years ago.
Some person, evidently a former Clin
tonville resident, sent a marked paper to
the local authorities, telling of the girl*
paying her last cent to her landlady and
turning on the gas as a result of 111 treat
ment by the man who posed as her hus
band. She declared that she had lived
with him at Spokane and that they had
quarreled because he wanted her to lead
an. immoral life.
The girl left here two years ago under
mysterious circumstances. In fact, 'lt
was supposed until the news of the at
tempted suicide was received that she
had been murdered here. All efforts to
trace her. from Clintonvllle failed and the,
local marshal at one stage of the In
vestigation put a male friend here in the
sweat box. but was convinced that he
was innocent. The river was dragged for
her body, and lt was not suspected that
she had left here alive, because she dis
appeared during the night, leaving prac
tically all her clothes at the place sh*
was staying.

NOVEL COLLECTION FLAX.
- BERKELEY, Oct. 29. â Believing that
the police would cheerfully assist him
in collecting money due as wages from
his employer. Jae Hai Loy, a Chinese
Cook, brought into Marshal VolUner's
office this afternoon a sack of etove
IMs, stove dampers and silverware, the
property of Mrs. M. C Gregory at 2507
Charming way, which he desired the
marshal to keep until Mrs. Gregory had
paid him $29 45.
"She owe me money and will not
pay%" cried the Chinese servant. "I
take .her stuff and you keep till I get
the money."
The conception of the Police Depart
ment as a collection agency for Chi
nese cooks did not appeal to the mar
shal. Mrs. Gregory was informed of
the location of her property and the
Chinaman was arrested. The woman
did not care to prosecute, however, ex
plaining: that the Chinaman had re
fused to stay with her until new
cook could be procured, and so she had
refused to Rive him his wages. The
Chinaman was accordingly released.

OAKLAND. Oct. 29. â A large volume
of small business has marked the last
week In Oakland and Alameda County
real estate circles, nearly all the trans
fers recorded having been of small
residence properties, sold to newcomers
who intend to make their nomes in
this city. One of tho most encouragr
ing features of the market is the faut
(that few of the residence sites sold
| during the month of October have been
I purchased on speculation,- the deals for
j the most part having been made by
: persons who Intend to reside in Oak
! land. . ;.;-;
There has been little change In the
value of real estate in the last three
months, except in the case of inside
business, property. This class of
realty, owing to a steady Increase in
the number of business houses in
\ Oakland, has increased in value, and
i there has also been an increase In
rents in the business district, caused
by the Increased demand for stores/
Local real estate dealers are well
satisfied with the condition of the mar
ket, . although * large . sales . have . been
few in the last two months. Several
dealers, however, report large deals
pending, which they expect to close De
fore the. end of .the year.
A. J. Snyder. one of the best known
Of Oakland's real estate men, said to
day that business as a whole is better
than at the same period last year,
though large sales are not so numer
ous. As Jast year was a record-break
er, this would Indicate that this year
will break all records fort the sale of
Alameda County property. Mr. Snyder
reports a large number of inquiries
Tor water front manufacturing sites,
with good prospects of several' big
deals before the close of the year. He
is of the opinion that when people ac
tually see the tracks of the Western
Pacific Railroad along the front there
will be a rapid development of that
district. .
Thomas Gilbert, formerly of Los An
geles, who also conducted a real estate
business in San Francisco, has Just
opened real estate offices in the Union
Bank, building, where he will engage

the local agency of a first-class insur
ance company.
The firm of Chapln & Booth, well
known real estate men, has Just re

larger quarters. .
K. J. Stewart has Just returned from

St-ewart said to-day that he was 'more
than ever convinced that Oakland has
a great future. Alameda County,' h_e
says, has a better climate than that of
the. southern city,, and also has many
'othtr attractions lacking In Los Ange-.
'les. . .; . '. ', ,- '
. George K. Fish 'reports a steady de
mand for all kinds of residence prop
erty, both improved and unimproved,
and especially for cottages of the
bungalow type. He has recently sold
several houses of this style and finds
the supply far short of the demand. Mr.
Fish says that a large percentage of the
inquiries for Alameda County property
made at his office cbme from people re
siding in San Francisco.
Articles of incorporation have just
been filed for the.- Oakland of
Commerce and appended to the docu
ment-are the names of a number of
prominent business men, who are mem
bers of the Oakland Board of Trade
and also of the Merchants' Exchange.
As. soon as a few more members are se
cured the articles of incorporation will
be fprwarded to the Secretary of State
for registration. .
The Rudell Re"al Estate Company of
Fruitvale has Just adopted a. 'new
method of advertising the eastern su
burb, which has never before been tried
in .Alameda County and which is ap
parently destined to prove a great suc
cess. The company is distributing
numbers of illuminated postal cards,
reproduced from photographs of points
of interest in Fruitvale, and bearing the
address of the company. . A large num
ber of the prominent residents of Fruit
vale are sending these cards to their
friends in the East and in other cities
on the coast.

than a -year has been the largest .tract
of unimproved property in Berkeley,

Mr. Barnhill also asked the question,
"How and by whom would my life work

In reply Mr. Osborne said that under
the present system of government the
I rights of the Individual are . entirely ig
nored by the so-called\publlc, und that no
society could possibly, "be, more ruthless Â»of
the rights of the" individual than is the
society of the present. He contended that
there Is something,"far higher in our pres
ent society than the Individual, and that
is the property or capitalistic class. He
declared that fealty to this class is to-day
the essence of religion, patriotism, civic
duty and all ethics, acd that disloyalty to
it is called sedition, treason and immor
ality.
The State Organizer also said that the
liberties of the people were not at pres-.

asked if it' were' not- as true of the nation
as of the Individual that it is easier for
a camel gÂ° through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter into the

and said that the King of England I was
recognized throughout the United States
as one of the wisest and most potent fac

the other hand the German Emperor, Mr.
Came, said, while a Christian as a man.
was a pagan. as a sovereign and. a peril

Miles Medical Col, Elkhart, IndMIGHTY UPRISING FOR JOHN S. PARTRIDGE IS INDICATED
* The FndoÃ Campaign Committee and the speakers 'fo* the cause of com
â¢ tto Â» boaesty 1b local government enter upon the closing vreek of the con
teat with confidence that victory will be achieved at the polls on November
7. The f cellar of confidence Is not based on surmise.. Reports of actual
. conditions la each of the eighteen Assembly districts are considered and
allowances made for errors 'of Judgment ' on " the part ' of " the overenthu
* elastic. Great demonstrations of popular Interest In Mr. Partridge's
candidacy signify, to the committee that wage earners have resolved
to throw off the shackles of Ruef. The chief purpose of the campaign
managers is to bring to the voting booths on election day every regis
tered citizen who Is against graft.
EVEN MONEY IS WAGED
THAT FUSION WILL WIN
Campaign Committee Is Assured That
â¢ Stay-at-Homes Will Vote Early.
The popular uprising which will oust
the graftere f ronj place and power. Is al
most here. Tuesday of next week Ruef
**UÂ» by hie political finish. All signs In
dicate that the people of Ban Francisco
have resolved to submit no longer to the
reign anS rule of graft and boodle. Since
the beginning of the campaign the graft
ers have encountered a series of reverses.
XJuef sought to capture the Republican
nominating convention and failed. HÂ«j
employed every resource at hie command
to prevent a coalition of Republicans and
Democrats. He endeavored to cenfuse the
plain issue before the people by placing
in the. field independent tickets bearing
Republican and I>emocratlc designations,
but his lawless scheme was foiled by the
Supreme Court.
Ruef 'stands now in the shadow of over
whelming defeat at the polls on Novem
ber 7.
A month ago the grafters were shout
ing that the betting was "two to one in
favor cf Ruef's candidate. Desperate ef
forts wt-rc made later on to hold the ap
parent advantage in the betting Held, but
in spite of everything that the grafting
politicians could do the odds changed to
10 to 7, then to 10 to S and again to 10 to S.
Be fore Wednesday evening next the gen
eral betting on Partridge will be even.
ThÂ« Ruefters are already hedging. It
would be no surprise if the betting graft
ers were driven to cover before this day
Is over. Last Saturday night many wag
ers were laid on an even money basis.
Such an uprising of good citizenship as
Ban Francisco has not witnessed for a
half century seems about to take place. It
Is just fifty "years ago that the good peo
ple of the city arose in their majesty and
â¢trength and drove the gamblers, grafters
and boodlers from power.
The talk one hears on the streets and
In public places is that many a so-called
"stay at home," who ordinarily takes lit
tle or no interest in voting, will go to
the polls early Tuesday of next week and
vote for John S. Partridge.
The large registration of voters and the
keen, obEorbing interest In the great
Struggle to redeem San Francisco signify
that tremendous voting strength will be
shown. To the fusion campaign commit
tee the promise of a heavy vote is an, in
dex of victory for Partridge.
To-night Mr. Partridge will speak to the
people of the Twenty-eighth Assembly
District. He will deliver his message to
the men of that important district. Ruef
prates of his . ownership of the Twenty
eighth, but , his boasting is not seriously
taken.
It is reported at fusion headquarters
that Henry Rice of the Fire Department
end one of the relics of an old .regime is
snaking a barroom canvass for Ruef's
candidate. Rice if listed on the roll as
8. hydrant man at $90 per month. As he is
a favorite of Rurf he is paid as the cap
tain of a disabled engine in the corpora -
MURDER STORY
MAY BE UNTRUE
Boy's Tale That His Sister
Killed Their Vat her Does
Not Bear Investigation
Special D!Â«r**-<a Â«> Tl:Â« C*U.
. GRANTS PASS. Or.. Oct. 29. â The in-
E vesilgation being made into the X. M.
Jennings murder mystery of Granite
Hill mining camp is damaging to the
confession made by Jasper Jennings,
eon of the murdered man. The boy
has said, that his sister committed tttÂ«
crime, but it lias been found that the
blood-stained tracks over the floor ot
the room In which the old man was
kiiied and whieli led over the doorst-.-p
and across the yard were tracks of a
man. They could not have been made
Pr Dora. Jennings.
To account for the tracks the hoy
. says his sister wore his shoes over
* her t>wn that the blame for the crim-i
if.ighl be laid at his door. The girl
denies all knowledge of the affair and
appears utterly in the dark regarding
it. As the boy cannot tell a straight
etory about the tracks the discovery of
them is considered damaging testimony
against Him. He says his sister stole
Into the cabin where he and a com
panion slept, late at night, and stole
both his rifle and his shoes. But the
door of the boy's cabin opens with dif
ficulty and its rusty hinges scrsecn
loudly. It seems impossible that the
door could have been opened without
one or both of the boys hearing it.
Interest in the mysterious case is
growing and there is a change in the
feeling of the general public toward
the girl. She will say absolutely noth
ing concerning the crime, while the
boy talks freely, though his confes
sion tends entirely toward shifting tire
blame upon his sister.

PLEAD FROM PULPITS IN ADVOCACY OF HIGH LICENSE
FIGURES GIVEN TO SHOW
THE NEED OF A CURB.
METHODIST â¢ PASTOR. WHOSE
SERMON LAST. EVENING WAS
STRONG AGAINST THE SALOONS.
"Higher License" was the subject â¢ dis
cussed by the Rev. Dr. A.- U. : Bane at
the Howard-street Methodist Episcopal
Church last night before a large cangre
gation. He spoke as 'follows:
I am opposed to the presence of the saloon
and to government sanction by license. If it
was a question of license or no: license. . I
would opjiose all' license, but. I am -not,per
mitted to vote on that question. lf-..l can't
prevent the presence of. the saloon ;l t>ught, as
a Christian, and a good citizen, hÂ» < regulate
it, io that it will do the least harm.- -If
can't dote all at â¢ once \u25a0 1". am- willing to" heTp
close wiiif of thÂ«-m. .~,
A higher Hceusw would mean fewer saloons;
fewer saloons' would mean fewer pitlalls and
less temptation. ' â¢ ' ....
\u25a0 The United States Supreme Court.hiis;decid
ed that the saloon haÂ« no . natural right â¢' to
exist. It Is a moral evil, a financial: burden,
a political nuisance- and an enemy! of. good
government. - Saloons make, \u25a0 necessary more
police officers, : police- courts, jails and asy
lums.' They: make !K) per cent of the. city's
police, court and charity work and expense.
Saloon's ought to be taxed enough -to pay.
the expense they cost the taxpayers. :> In"; San
Francisco one-fourth of all our taxes -is raised
to pay the expense of the Police Department.
The expense of the San Francisco Police De
partment Is $1,000,000 - per â¢ year. : The csaloonÃ
cause two-thirds of that, expense â the>>pay in
licenses $266,000. So the saloons cost the Po
lice-Department of thjs city $400,000 more than
they' pay. lnto the treasury In licenses. ; The *a

PASTOR TELLS
OF STRUGGLE
IN BOYHOOD
MINISTER OF GOSPEL WHO SAYS
.... UNIONS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF
.. POLITICS.
Rev; George Hough
in; : Touch With
; r The. moral side of the political situation
was s discussed- by the .Rev. George .A
Hough last-e vening at the '\u25a0; California
street-Alethodist'Eptscopal Church. f -
: Mr.l Hough told of his sympathy with
the 'laboring man ; told how he himself
had come [from poverty, earning at one
time Jl.Sa, a week, and wished that' his
tongue might be silenced if he ever lost
his sympathy for the class from whom he
has sprung.-,'
An- unusual scene occurred in the church
when the ; reverend speaker was loudly
applauded by men ana women when he
said that/no man is great enough to be
Mayor :â¢ of" .San ' Francisco who cannot
stand alone. In part the speaker said:
\u25a0 It is 'not', without hesitancy that I speak to
you' upon- this -topic oi essentially/ locai Inter
est. 'â¢â¢ My cumparatlvely brief residence in San
frrancifcco docs! nut quality me to make an ex
haustive review or local conditions. I have no
personal-, acquaintanceship , with cither of the
candidates "lor Mayor, and Know nothing of
their history, only that which Is the common
property-: or; the con.ii.unit>. .As a ruie the
preacher; fchould be silent in politics, but wheu
tho issues are purely moral he should enter the
arena. with >poiished blade and with no uncer
tain battle cry. \u25a0&m&HfP&p*
It 'has. been said that such is'the condition
of this' campaign.: and if so It would be cow
ardly.'ancl-unmanly for s me to be silent. \ â¢
.- No '. man . knows ;the moral conditions und
problems of the- community better than the
pastor; and It is his duty to conserve, not only
individual 'righteousness but civic.
Prior- to' entering the ministry I was lor a
time; ln the employ of one ot the great political
parties; 'and had charge of the national cam
palgn In; a. largo portion of the state in 1596.
Thus . 1 can speak from the standpoint of the
politician; as that of the pastor.
..; A man In politics can be so clean and up
light that his ; probity will never be questioned,
though, men 'may. differ with him In political
measure*., ?V
'\u25a0'; .The great. need of San Francisco is the clar
ifying of \u25a0 Its moral' atmosphere.- She needs an
administration, that â¢will have the confidence
Of the best'" citizenship or me nation.
- It is a fact'that I have met men and women
who â¢; are-' afraid- U>. rear their children In ; San
Francisco." , It Is "â¢ more than trade winds and
fog that keep people from settling here. '

way of making, a' llvlng.*~*< This sensible - ami
conservative Mew: of; the liquor \u25a0 traffic* has
furnished the basis ot action en this matter

The whole Catholic community, of this city
has been for many . years committed .to the
work Dt the "League of the Cross, : whose im

bring up a generation to manhood with habits
ot temoeranc* 1 and -sobriety; -. So \u25a0heartily has
Archbishop \u25a0Iliordan- been devoted to this work
that for several .years he has set apart a
priest for, it- who mleht devotÂ« himself to it
as his SDeclal mission.,- But we all know th*
many temptations that \u25a0 beset , the path of old
and young toundermlne these endeavors and to
allure to .habits, of drinking and intoxication.
All. feel convinced that among -these temDta
tions the great number of. and' the al-'
most unregulated sale of liquor hold the first
place. '' v*T. : â¢ â¢ .'\u25a0 '-\u25a0 " ' -\u25a0
It is often difficult for the Catholic priest to
co-operate as , he: would wish to with many
engaged In temperance" reform because of the
radical measures frequently proposed, - and be
cause they-, are* sometimes' so- mingled with
political Issues .that \u25a0It would put the. priest
in the attitude of a politician, and to this our
own people are the first- to object and rlehtly
so. But when there- Is a measure proposed
that commend? , Itself '. to our- Judgment; and
when it can be .approached," advocated and
voted upon -without falsifying our position, we
should avail . ourselves of It; Such a measure
is proposed to us now.. Ten 'days from to-day
we shall be called upon to vote to Increase the
license on tho. sale of .'liquor .in 'San Francisco
from $84 ' per annuqi,' the present rate, to $125
per quarter. It Is" 1 ' believed â¢ that \u25a0 If . this be
come a law .It .will furnish 'at least .a. partial
relief. The Intent Is not simply and solely to
create or Increase a revenue, . though" certainly
that feature of it is, not- to- be discounted.
No doubt the- wholesale- and the retail sale
of liquors is lucrative to those engaged In it.
but It Is Just -as certain that .there -is not an

fatally beaten with clubs wielded by
the robbers. Scott at 2 o'clock was

When Scott saw that he was overpow

his money and begged them not to hurt
Despite his pleas he was felled to the
sidewalk and kicked and beaten. He
shouted for help, but the place where
the hold-up occurred is a lonely one at

MONDAY OCTOBER 30, 1905
A LIVELIER WEEK IN TRADE.
'-pHE hall in business noted during the first half of October
. r was succeeded last week by the appearance of a remarkable
*- demand for all sorts of breadstuff s. It was the feature of
the week and dwarfed all other conditions. Minneapolis reported
immense sales of flour. An increased European demand for wheat
was observed, while our own American consumers were in the
market as eager buyers of large lines. Texas was reported out of
wheat, and as one market dispatch put it, was "chewing into the
Kansas supply" with a greediness that promised to exhaust it oefore
long. At Minneapolis the millers were reported taking all the
choice milling grades the}- could lay their hands on. Mexico was also
very short, and not only withdrew the duty on wheat, but an
nounced her intention of becoming a liberal buyer in the American
markets. Winnipeg also appeared as a buyer in the American
Northwest.
This sudden and vast demand for wheat caused excited trading
at Chicago, and on one or two days that market rose sharply with
a general scramble to buy. Exports of corn also increased ma
terially, while -the demand for oats was as keen as that for wheat.
So, taken all around, it was a great week in breadstuff s. The
railroads were affected by this immense movement and could not
supply sufficient cars with which to move the grain. Another source
of activity was cotton. Not only was speculation in this staple
active, both at Xew York and at New Orleans, but a large business
was done at Liverpool. The effect of this demand was similar to
that produced by the scramble for breadstuffs, and the cotton
market became unsettled, the excitement being aggravated by all
sorts of reports and estimates regarding the crop now being har
vested. The estimates vary widely, ranging all the way from
9.500,000 to 12.000,000 bales, according to the interests of the
different parties sending out guesses ; but the conservative elements
seem to be grouped in the neighborhood of 10,000,000 bales, which
is a fair crop, though several million bales short of the output
of 1904.
Of course this great activity in the country's most important
staples had its influence on general trade. It could not be other
wise. The financiers and Wall street operators saw in it a great
traffic for the railroads during the coming year, continued flush
times among the farmers and country merchants arid a good whole
sale and jobbing demand for all sorts of merchandise. Stocks did
not move" much, one way or the other, but the money market con
tinued to ease off, with a further decline in rates of interest. A
larger demand for dry goods was reported, and this in turn pro
duced a reflex firmness on the cotton market.
Several of the other agricultural and industrial staples did not
make such a brilliant showing as cotton and breadstuffs. The hiyh
prices of wool quieted down the woolen market, which in turn
caused a decreased demand for the raw wool and led to an easier
tendency in prices. The high quotations for hides and leather also
led the Hide and Leather Corporation to pass its dividend, as they
compelled the corporation to employ all of its capital in the conduct
of its daily operations.
The iron and steel industry is still apparently active and in
good condition. Xew steel rail orders placed /hiring the past ten
weeks aggregate 1,486,500 tons, the largest business in this line
ever known. The coke and coal industries are reported taxed to
their utmost capacity, with prices more likely to advance than
decline. The general exports of the country in September were
the heaviest on record, the total being $136,000,000, or $2,000,000
in excess of September, 1904. These large exports, however, are
largely offset by equally large imports, those for September being
$102,000,000. The net result of these exports and imports was an
excess of exports for the month of $33,000,000, against $50,000,000
a year ago.
The usual weekly statistic made a good exhibit last week. The
bank clearings showed the very slight gain of 3.7 per cent over the
corresponding week of 1904, but the aggregate clearings exceeded
$2,800,000,000. with all the large cities except New York, St. Louis
and New Orleans recording gains. The railway earnings for
October were 6 per cent larger than in October, 1904.
Considered as a whole, the trade showing last week was most
excellent and better than for several weeks past. As long as
buyers are scrambling over each other to buy our cotton, wheat,
corn and oats, our steel mills are taxed to their fullest capacity
to fill the Orders sent in to them, and our coke and coal industries
worked to their limit for fuel, good times will continue. There will
undoubtedly be lulls, as during the first fortnight in October, but
they always occur, even in the most active trade*eras.
RAILWAY RATE REGULATION.
NOW" that a big convention held in Chicago to consider the
question of railway rate regulation has decided in favor of the
policy of enlarging the powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission for that purpose is a time when the summarizing of
that policy, and of the history and justification of restrictive rail
wa}' regulation, is valuable just for recollection.. This desirable
thing is well executed in the conclusions of the final chapter of a
newly published book on that subject by Henry S. Haines, the
author of "American Railway Management." and who has held
a number of high positions in railway control and is well qualified
to make such a study. The work contains the substance of a course
of lectures delivered last spring at the Boston University School
The question of rate regulation is probably the largest issue
now coming up before the public for solution. It is not only
directly and in itself a great matter, but its decision, by the power
of established precedent, will extensively affect our whole economic,
system. One of the first items to consider is the magnitude to
which our railway interests have grown. The mileage is almost:
equal to one-half that of the whole world. Counting employes.,
stockholders and the families of both, the people directly dependent
.on the welfare of the roads amounts to one-fifth of the population.
In recognition of the rights and influence of the press it .has been
named the "fourth estate" among the powers that be, and perhaps
the one-fifth of our population directly interested in railways might
be called "the fifth estate."-
In the decision to extend restrictive legislation the importance
of this great estate is not forgotten. The railway historian believes
that in the general summing up every dollar that the public has
granted to railways in bounties and the value of granted privileges
lias been amply returned to the public in the advancement of pros
perity and in the facilities for easy intercommunication which has
so efficiently helped to break down provincial prejudices, and to
knit us. by their network into a homogeneous nation, much more
strongly woven by peace than those other peoples by -conquest
joined.
However, the regulation of the compensation for the public
service is no new thing. "It had been for centuries recognized as
a fundamental principle of common law." When our laws*pro
hibited traffic agreements it wag such a heavy blow to the internal
control of the regulation of railway rates that logically there is now
no other mode for the making of joint rates except by the exercise
of some control external to the corporate will of the parties directly
interested in the profits that ace made by those rates. The history
of economic evolution is the history of the struggle for a balanced
adjustment between competition /and combination. There are
goods and evils in competition, and likewise in combination use
and abuse show its need of delimitation.
Railway development has so far advanced in this country that
most of the measure' of evil that resides in competition has been
eliminated. Practically ;the whole great system is controlled by eight
traffic managers. Wasteful" competition is thus avoided. Fear for

VARIETIES OF INSURANCE.
"Many persons have perforce been
compelled to read facts about insur
ance companies recently," said a gen
eral agent, "but I'll venture to" say that
not more than one person out of 10,000
realizes even faintly the astounding
spread of the principle of ;assurance.
The ordinary citizen knows ; only the
life and fire lines which directly con
cern him, while the ordinary business
man may be aware of the . existence
of other lines, such as plate glass in
surance, etc.
"Now if there's anything in the
sphere of human activities that is not
covered by insurance it is because that
object has been overlooked by the in
surance promoter. Very soon I -'ex
pect that insurance companies wili
write airship and submarine insurance
in the interest of foolhardy aeronauts
and inventors. Here's a list of lines
now in existence that should prove a
revelation:
"Fire, life, safe, rents, patent, ma
rine, tornado, theft, credit, plate glass,
transportation, tourists' baggage, acci

THINGS 1 HAVE SEU.V.
! I knew 'a man who always said "I have
saw" and "He has came," but he "saw his
way clear to do many a deed of kindness,
and he "came" to many a weary wander
er as a very angel of blessing; and, take
it for all in all, I think that we may as
well overlook his grammar.
I knew a girl who fairly shone in the
parlor while her old moiher did the work
in the kitchen, and since I have discov
ered the fact some way she does not seem
to shine as much as she did.
i There was a clergyman who preached
what the sisters termed "perfectly beau
tiful sermons," but since I have become
thoroughly acquainted with him I do not
care to hear them. , .
I knew a man who owned no creed and
yet lived a "helpful, loving life, andâ how
would you account for that?
I heard that as the twig is bent the
tree's inclined, and generally it is true;
but there are men in San Quentin whose
parents reared them tenderly, carefully
and prayerfully, and I cannot help won
dering what ailed the twig in such cases.
I have seen a woman who wore her best
and prettiest dresses before her marriage
wear a kimono that would make your
heart ache to look at it every day and
nearly all day since that eventâ and yet
she wonders what makes John seem so
different from what he seemed before
they joined hands.
HER MISFIT AFFIX IT V.
"You had better not marry him," urged
the Wise Friend.
"But, 7 the Sweet Young Thing protest
ed, "I know that he is my Affinity, and
I feel that I cannoi do otherwise than
to marry him."
So she married him.
And now she has discovered that her Af
finity gets full regularly every Saturday
and loses his job just as regularly every
Other Saturday, and does not support her,
and treats her somewhat less kindly than
htr father treated his cow, and is, in
brief, covered with the very slime of
earth.
And now the Sweet Young Thing (no
longer as sweet as formerly) is a firm ad
herent of the creed that Affinities are a
mliihty JSimi Article. (
And the creed is not without its legion

WHEN PA TA UGHT THE CALF.
When my pa taught the calf to drink, that
was a thrillin' day,
Fer pa's a leader in the church an' walks
a pious way.
Wcli, firs' he taught that blessed calf; he
hummed a hymn the while â
Of course, pa hummed it, fer the calfâ
well, 'singin' want its style;
And then he chucked its head down in a
pail of milk he had.
An' what then happened, to relate. It
makes me mishty sad;
The calf firs' butted pa, an' then my pa,
he butted, too.
An' when that buttin' match was done
the ground with pa was strew. C-}; : ,*lli
But pa he kept his piety an' tried to hum
the hymn.
Though I could see his slngin' notes wus
glttin'.middlin' slim. ' \
An' then he tried the calf again; the calf
It tried him, too,
An' laid my pa upon his back, while milk
about him flew.
It landed mostly in his face, though some
was on his clothes,
An' firs' he gasped, an* then he choked,
an' then he slowly rose,
An' then he staggered to the fence, an'
6ays, an' give a couch:
"Jest turn that hose upon your pa an'
wash thi3 barnyard off."
An' then a light of stern resolve come
gleamln' in pa's eye,
An' he remarked, "My son, vamoose, an'
be quite middlln' spry!
I'll tackle that derned calf again although
I'm. bound ter lose.
An' I don't mean no son of mine shall
hear the words I use."
So I vamoosedâ l thought 'twas bestâ but
ever sence that day
I've allers- wondered jest what words my
pa designed ter say.
I know he's pious, but all folks '11 wander
frum the road,
An 1 jedgin' by the calf. I s'pose he said,
"I will be blowed!"
THE FABLE OF ALADDI.V.
As every . reader \u25a0of the Arabian Nights
Entertainment must realize, Aladdin was
a lazy, , good-for-nothing lout and par
boiled chump . who ought to have been
thrashed within an inch of his life by his
mother, so as to teach him some other
road than that to San Quentin.
Now it so happened that the Bright Boy
in the class had heard of Aladdin's won
derful lamp and coveted it. So he went
to Aladdin, and- said:
"I'll trade yer six marbles fer yer old
lamp."
Aladdin refused to, trade.
"Aw, well," the Bright Boy continued,
"keep yer dern old lamp. v It's no good,
noway. I kin buy lots of dem round town
fer two fer a ; nick; \ it's nuttin but brass
anyways; but I'm a friend ob yourn, and
so I'll make it seben marbles."
Aladdin appeared ;to hesitate.
"An' seem' it's you I'll trow in me top,
too, an* it's a'eood un." .
So Aladdin traded., and that is why you

SAVING AND SPENDING
\u25a0 â¢ . . , - â
Teaching Children How to Do Each Is a Matter of
the Greatest Importance.
. â ' .
DOROTHY FENIMORE
r-pEACH your children to save money. It is the first let ter In the Â«t
| of living. Then teach them how to spend it. This is the second
WhaTTs the curse of the rich? Satiety. What is the curse of the poor!
v A wrong estimation of value. In both cases money is the roo. of Â«Â° fta P"
plness. Yet money, well used, is the golden key to opportunity, for the
rich as weir as for the poor. *.
Teach children, then, the value of
money. For as long as money if the
recognized standard of value the
monetary sense must be developed,
because In no other way Is It pos
sible to grain an intelligent compre
hension of true values in other re
lations" of life.
We grown-up people of ordinary
means know how Important a part
the moneÂ£ which we have to fall
back on plays In our success. It is
on account of this that some of us
are free to choose our work, and be
cause relieved of anxiety for the
morrow, to do our best to-day. But
we regard this knowledge as a bit
of grown-up wisdom, something to
be assumed with long gowns or long
trousers, sauce suitable for the goose
and gander, but too strong for the
goslings. i
I believe that children should be
taught the same lesson. And I
think that they should be instructed
practically, through investments of
their own, that money well invested
earns money without effort on the
part of its owner.
â¢Such teaching is as possible among
the poor as among the well-to-do.
An illustration of this came to my
attention a short time ago. A boy
who received 5 cents a morning for
sweeping a store was persuaded by
a member of a. Penny Savings So
ciety to put by. part of his earnings,
and later, when he had enough, to
open an account at a regular sav
ings bank. One time when he went
to make a deposit at the bank a few
cents' interest was put to his credit,^
and, delighted, he exclaimed: /
"There are a few cent 3 which I did not have to sweep for.
The corner-stone of his fortune was now laid, for henceforth he nad
a practical reason for saving.
It Is wonderful what the public school children of Chicago have done
with their pennies in some districts of the city since. In 180 S. the Board
of Kdudation decided that the teachers in the public schools might act as
agents for a Penny Savings Society. The very first year of the work the
children of a school in one of the poorer quarters of the city were able,
in spite of their poverty, to save, under the direction of the principal,
over $600 in the first six months.
The money that 1 hitherto had gone to the corner store for cigarettes
and gum and terra alba was used to buy boots and clothing and to help
pay the rent of many a family.
To know how to save is not enough, whatever your walk in life. You
must know also how to speqd.
I have Just read an article which exploits the methods by which Its
author saved $5000 in three year 3 on a salary of $18 a week. He did It
by working hard and living simply â two real virtues â and also by the les3
creditable means of loaning his savings at 2 per cent a month to Improvi
dent friends, salving his conscience for his transgression of the law by the
' fact that he charged less than the regular loan sharks did.
He boasts that he is making a success in life. Is he? In his whole ac
count of his hard-working but sordid career there is not one suggestion
of a eenerous action.
Money-grubbing is a mean kind of folly. It leads to nothing worth
ier than money-grubbing. Teach your children to save therefore not for
the mere sake of saving, but because thrift means, besides self-help, a
chance for generosity.

CARDS â Reader, City. The latest work

made on the day at home, the caller
usually takes the requisite number of
cards from her case before ringing the
door bell. If she is a married woman
calling: upon a married woman who
has invited her recently to a dance or
dinner she takes two of her husband's
cards from her case with two of her
own. Her two cards are enough if slit*
asks to see the ladies, implying there
by her hostess and one or more daugh
ters. If the hostess is entertaining a
friend, a sister, her mother or a mar
ried daughter at the time, the lady
calling takes three of her own cards
and with these in her hands she
awaits the servant. Should the reply
to her question be "Not at home' sho*
hands the card to the maid and goes'
on. If the lady called on appears the
caller In passings out puts two of her
husband's cards in the hall tray."LARGE CONVENTION
OF CLUBS AT HAND
OPPOSED TO SUPERSTITION
Fewer Figures and More Facts Are Pleaded
For in Coming Conclave.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
San Francisco has been honored with
the nfxi annual foregathering of the
Ban Francisco district of the California
Federation of Women's Clubs, which
will convene in California Club Hall,
1700 Clay street, on- November 13.
; Bad day? W'iiy, mooting: on the 13Ui
is a demonstration that superstition
is dead with the progressive clubwo
man â except when she breaks a look
lng--glaES â but that's different, you
kaow. She loses the mirror.
"W> all remember â sonic COO of vs â
the details of the last district meet
ing:, held iv Palo Alto. We recall the
delightful reception accorded the dele
gates from without the college town.
of the hospitality extended to them by
the women of the Palo Alto Woman's
Club; but we also recall, with a stifiod
groan, the ponderous, logy, soporific
reports that were unloaded upon us by
well meaning but misguided fellow
clubwomen, who believe the object of
the convention to elucidate all the de
tails of their club's housekeeping.
Now it is taken for granted that
rocr club's Internal affairs are proper
ly conducted, particularly as to
rnances â that your club officials look
after these matters in the natural dis
charge of their duties. Therefore go
ing Into a minute exposition of re
ceipts and disbursements of your clubs,
*unto the last penny, takes up valuable
time that were better spent getting
acquainted with one another.
" The object of the district meetings?
Primarily, to know what other wo
men are doing, and thus to gain in
spiration and encouragement in definite
work; but best of all. is the oppor
tunity offered to get acquainted with
women of different environments and
of necessarily different views. This is
the big thing accomplished by these
general meeting's, and the thing wo
men stand most in need of â this wid
ening of their visions.
Therefore it Is to be hoped that
when the programme is made out for
the coming convention the topics will
be= comprehensive, brief as is consist
c efit with intelligent presentation, and
thmt only r*ally important, vital mat
ters will be presented.
To be sure, these strictures are more
easily discussed than practiced, inasmuch
as every leader in every club in the dis
trict, like all specialists, is absolutely
and' unalterably convinced that her epe
*cial subject is of infinitely more value
than any other matter of club activity.
Hence the programme committee must 'â¢
c l>e firm enough to say "no" when circum- i
render it necessary for the gen
eral jroodâ and the general comfortâre
gardless of the fact that Mrs. A is likely
toÂ»grow indignant and sputter about re
tinning if she. is not given a place upon
th* programme.
Moreover, it is to be hoped that the
programme committee will present speak
ers who can be heard. If a woman writes
a good paper, but has a "gentle Annie"
voice, let some one else read it who can
be heard. If a paper is interesting
enough to be presented to a convention it
'should be heard by all â and without
straining one's nerves to hear it. That
robs it of half its value, and robs the
wprld of a lot of good nature.
When women's conventions shall have
learned to be concise of speech, to elim
inate the irrelevant and the unimportant,
to sacrifice vanity to the general good
ar.d to loosen up socially, to unfurl the
academic brow and be "'good fellows" to- â¢
gether. without knocking, then shall Uto
j-ia, become our dwelling place.
And may the good time hasten!
Aiid a good time to begin is on Novem
ber 13, in the year of our Lord 1905.

WHY DOCTORS FAIL
AND lARS. PINKHAM SUCCEEDS
Plain Reasons Are Here Given to Explain
Why Lydla E. Pinkham'* Vegetable Com-
pound Cures When Doctors Are Powerless
A woman is sick ; some d isease peculiar
to her sex is fast developing in her sys-
tem. She g"oos to her family physician
and tells him a story, but not tlie whole
Story.
She holds something 1 back, loses her
head, becomes agitated, forgets what
Khe wants to say, and finally conceals
what she ought to hare told, and thus
completely mystifies the doctor.
Is it any wonder, therefore, that the
doctors fail to cure the disease ? Still
wecatfnot blame the woman, for it is
rervÂ«embaxrassing to detail some of the
symptoms of her suffering, even to her
family physician.
It was for this reason that years ago
Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass., de-
termined to step in and help her sex.
Having bad cdnsiderable experience in
treating female ills with her Vegetable
Compound, she encouraged the women
of America to write to her for advice in
regard to their complaints, and being a
woman, it was easy for her ailing sis-
ters to pour into her ears every detail
of their suffering.
In this way she was abla to do for
them what the physicians were unable
to do, 6imply because she had the
proper information to work upon, and
from the little group of women who
sought her advice years ago a great
army of her fellow-beings are to-day
constantly applying for advice and re-
lief, and the fact that many thou-
sands of them have been cured by
following the advice of Mrs. Pinkham
during the last year is indicative of the
grand results which are produced by
Â£er unequaled experience and training.
No physician in the world has had
such a training, or has such an amount
of information at hand to assist in the
treatment of all kinds of female ills,
from the simplest local irritation to
the most complicated womb diseases,
This, therefore, is the reason why
Mrs. Pinkham. in her laboratory at
Lynn, Mass., Is able to do more for the
ailing women of America than the
family physician. Any woman, there-
fore, is responsible for her own suffer-
ing who will not take the trouble to
write to Mrs. Pinkham for advice.
The testimonials which we are con-
stantly publishing from grateful wo-
men establish beyond a doubt the
power of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
coxmxrand*to conouer female difieafift*.
it is believed that $250 will be turned over
to the Landmarks League to help put a
j roof upojj Mission San Antonio, in Mon
terey County.
\u25a0 The i-rdure upon "California's Historic
I I^aÂ»d:nark?," by Congressman Jost'ph R.
; Knowland. with more than one hundted
! superb views, was attended by over 500
| guests, and to tho honor of San Francisco
be it said that the lecture, drew twice
more people than either whist or live
i hundredâ it really looking as if the people
â¢ of our city were awakening to an appre
j elation o*. their own history- and had set
j about acquiring a speaking acquaintance
with it. And so there was joy in the
hearts of the Landmarks Leaguers, not
! only for the dollars, which are necessary.
j but for the interest demonstrated in the
| State's history, which until the last few
years has been neglected by Californlans,
and by otherwise intelligent Californians,
to a shameful degree.
But there's light ahead!

To-morrow the California Club will have

have the honor of meeting Mrs. Wolle,

the college town to which she and her
husband have recently been called.
As chairman of the 'music section, Mi^s
Juliet Greninger will be hostess, assisted

Inasmuch as the bill creating a fund for
the establishment .of a choir of music in

Those who were wise enough to attend
the Taft and the Zueblin lectures at the
California Cliib have been mentally en
riched and charmingly entertained.
As for the Taft lectureâ which was cul
tural and fascinating, both In subject and
treatmentâ that is gone, as Mr. Taft left
for the North yesterday morning, unhap
pily denying San Francisco a chance to
greet him. Perhaps when h*e comes back
this eminent sculptor may be persuaded
to stop over, and get acquainted with
some of our artist folk, clubwomen and
other people who would like to know him.

With the Zueblin lectures we are luck
ier, for those who were unfortunate
enough not to have heard this young pro
fessor from the Chicago University may
do so next Wednesday night, when he
will talk upon "The Training of a Citi
zen."
While it is possible that some of the
California Club mothers â Mrs. Aylette
Cotton, for instance, who has been a fa
mous success of citizen-trainingâ might
give the young sociologist a few practical
points upon the subject, nevertheless the
talk should be heard by every mother,
father and teacher in San Francisco.
Mr. Zueblin is as finished a lecturer and
just as charming as Henry Morse Ste
phens â no higher compliment can I pay
him, for I know none more finished or
charming. And he tells a little story just
as "cute" as does Professor Stephens,
who, though an Englishman, can serve
up a story in a fashion that doesn't need
a diagram.
While it is true that Mr. Zueblin comes
from the University of Chicago, he
doesn't "smell of oil." In fact, his doc
trines are the antitheses of Rockefeller
ism. He lectures Wednesday night at the
California Club hall. 1750 Clay street, at
8:15 o'clock. Tickets 50 cents, or $2 for the
remaining course of five lectures upon
civic subjects.

leader, presents the following:
"The section of literature and drama
will meet to study and discuss the
thoughtful plays of the New York and
London seasons. These plays will be con
sidered first as drama and second as lit
erature, with readings selected to illus
trate both viewpoints. The object of. the

mates it."

unquestionably the moving spirit of a
very charming affair.
The afternoon was given over to a dis

A Connecticut man of an inventive
turn once sought an interview with Mr.
Root, while the latter was Secretary of
War, for tlie purpose of explaining the
merits of an explosive of his invention.
"This man." says Major General
Corbin, who chanced to be in the Secre
tary's office at the time the inventor
was received, "claimed to have the
most powerful Explosive the world had
ever seen. 'It would destroy any<army
against which It is directed,' declared
the yankee. 'Now I propose to send
up a balloon over any army attacking
us, set tins a fuse connected with a
quantity of this explosive, and so tim
ing It that the explosion would. occur
at the precise moment that the balloon
floated directly over the army of ,the
enemy.'
" "That's all very well." observed Mr.
Root, 'but. suppose that a current of
air shouid unexpectedly carry your ex
plosive balloon over bur army â what
then?'
"'My friend.' calmly replied the in
ventor, impressively tapping the Secre
tary on the arm, 'in that case, our army
would have to get up and run : â and run
like the devil, too!'" â Collier's. Weekly.

Special Dispatch to. The Call.
SETATTLE.'Oct. 29.â Persistent neglect,
covering a long* period of years, may
be responsible for a repetition Â«of the
Benning/ton disaster In Puget Sound
waters on the revenue cutter Grant,
now lying, in the harbor of Elliott Bay.
On the authority of ofh'cers'now serving
aboard the craift it has been said that
her boilers are worn out and almost in
a condition beyond repair, beside being
many, years hehind the times. : The con
dition :of ; the boilers on the Grant is
/such that she canno^ carry much above
a flfth of 'her scheduled 150 pounds'
pressure of steam per square inch.* As
a matter of fact, for a long 1 time the
Grarvt*has never run over thirty poun&s,
as this is the mark sit by her,officers
beyondwhich wt>uld be peril. It is fur
ther eaid. ,that if # the records of the
Treasury. Department could be.' ex
amrhed they would disclose the shock
ing truth that more than'one report _has
been forwarded, but nothing has been
done. ; 'y^'^r-c *
BALLOON POSTAL CARDS |
r SUBJECT TO Â§ HIGHER pUT.Y
Appraisers Snstpln Ansessment of 35
I'er <>"nt AU J r a- \u0084
S ' . lorem. \u25a0 ", '
The ingenuity of foreign manufacturers
of postal cards is keeping. she customs
authorities on this side of t:Â»e ocean busy
ascertaining tho proper classification of
the missives under. the Dingley tariff law.
H Time was whea the classification of the
post cards v/as comparatively a simple
matter, but they have become sp elabor
ate and in certain respects so complicated
that conflicts between importers and the
Treasury's officers have become frequent.
Meffert & Co. pf . this city is the* latest
firm to have trouble with the .officials
regarding the classification of post cards.
.This firm imported cards made of two
layers of paper pasted together, with a
thin sheet of soft rubber between. A
portion of the message sice has been cut
out in "different forms,' such as balloons,
tubljles, etc., while a small tio:e has been
pierced in the front of . the card. By
blowing through this hole the rubber is
distended in the form, of the .cut-out. ' /
Collector Stranahan, after consulting
the appraiser thfe examiner, came to
tlie conclusion thatUhe articles mustpay
duty at the rate of 35 per cent ad valorem
under the provision in the tariff for manu
fjictures of paper and soft rubber, paper
being the material of chief value. The
'importers, however, contended that the
cards should be assessed eith.er as litho
graphic prints," or. at 25 per cent as printed
'matter. â¢i-. '.-: ..*',.-... .
. The matter was referred to the board of
general appraisers -for settlement. That
tribunal, in an opinion written by, Israel
F. Fischer, upholds the collector's' classi
fication.
Wbaf lie Wnnted to Know.
A rather amusing story ts told in con
nection .with- a . certain learned profes
sor, lie had been asked to deliver a
lecture? â which he readily consented to
doâ in the village school room, and on the
important night, the place was packed
with an expectant audience.
The front scats were occupied by a few
of tho shining- lights of the neighborhood,
"and apparently the lecturer was address-
Ing the select few, for he talked complete
ly over the heads of the rest of the audi
ence. iS&Si
At length, at the expiration of a couple
of hours, the professor, dropped his lofty
style and blandly remarked:
â¢ "And now, friends, in conclusion, allow
me to say that if any one has a question
to ask I will do my best to ans.wer him."
It was a villager. in the back scats who
slowly rose to his feet and asked the first
and only question.
"Aw'd be , vurry mien obleeged, meas
ter," he. remarked, "if ye'd just tell us
v/ot on airth it is that ye've been praich
ing aboot?"â Tit Bits.
It is estimated that if Embassador
Reid keeps up -the social pace lm has
set in England, :iis term as American
representative : will cost him 1 about a
half million dollars.

The Seals thought they could > about
ibunco the Commuters out of second place
yesterday, and with this idea, they began
to give the Giants a good time just as
soon as the working hour was called at
.10 in the morning. From that time on
they were gtjing to the limit. Both games
\u25a0were broken up in jig time, especially the
second. Which was handed to Uncle Hank
before It was five minutes old.
It 1Â« not often that a ball team wades
in and clouts a pitcher for five runs while
ihÂ«? first Inning, is still In its Infancy. But
Xhe Seals pulled off this stunt yesterday
a.fternooa, and they did It so dexterously
"vhat Mr. Garvin. who was the fall guy,
hardly had a chance to realize what the
'batsmen were trying to do to
him.
WaMron. the first man to go up against
The syl^a-Jike Texsm. got a scratch hit
Â«60-wn the third base line. Mohler was also
irood for a single, but Illlaebrand was
more ambitious and responded with a
tripJe to left that let both men through.
Right back came Nealon with a double
jBMd Householder with a sacrifice. Irwin
â¢did not fall down, for he rapped out an
other one, A. couple of outs put him up
the line, and another blngJe let him
through. ;/.
When the side was finally retired the
Seals were there with as many as five
runs. Everybody thought that start would
lake all the life out of the game, but not
50, for the Giants seemed to get into the
polngr and managed to hold Uncle's troop
ers safe till the eighth, when they again
negotiated for two more on Van Buren's
â¢error.
In the meantime Hitt made the Giants
look like a fiock of spinsters trying to en
*nan* a live one. He had command of the
"ball and the Giants were simply buffaloed.
K'ive of them managed to tear through
with hits, but when men were on bases
Hitt had^-^npre lenders than ordinarily
*nd there never was a chance for Port
land to come through.
Although the game was replete with
*-t;irtTing bits of fielding, Atz and McHale
'Tld'tne best two ytunts bf the afternoon.
In the sixth, when the Seals had a full
\u25a0house, Waldron poked a low, rakish one
out toward left field, which Atz grabbed
with one mitt. Nealon dispatched one to
tvard the center field fence in the seventh
That made a noise like a two-bagger. But
McHale ta>ok it nff the boards with his
eyes shut, and Joe was minus a safe
drive. The score:

Ticrru Ar* Vnaqulshed In Two Close
Games at Oakland*
Oakland took a. brace of games "from
Tacoma yesterday, winning the morn-
SEALS GIVE THE GIANTS TWO BEATINGS
Ing game by a score of 2 to 1 and the
afternoon contest. 2 -to 0. In both
games there were several clever stunts,
there being a double play in the morn
ing in which five Commuters partici
pated. Both games were attended by
large crowds and the fans were in an
enthusiastic mood. / .
Four of the seven games in the
series Just closed were won by Oak
land. In the game this morning there
were two men on bases when Hogan
went to the bat. He failed to hit and
McLaughlin, who was on third, tried to
steal home. The left fielder was
caught between the bases by McMur
j ray. Devereaur, Francks, Dunleavy and
I Moskiman. There was a rapid ex
j change of the sphere until Moskiman
j touched the runner, out; Tacoma made
Sits run on an error by Kelly in the
sixth. In the eighth Oakland put two
over the plate. Devereaux hit and
went to second on McLaughlin's error.
] Then it was up to young Hogan, who
had pitched a brilliant game, to win It.
He-- made good with a hit to right,
sending Devereaux home, and scorea
the second run on Van Haltren's two
bagger.
j In the afternoon Keefe and Iberg
i both pitched winning ball, but Iberg's
I support was errorless, Keefe. was
j forced to play his own- game." ' He
struck out eight men' and avowed only
two hits, but Doc Moskiman smashed
out a two-bagger at a critical time,
and errors by Eagan, Hogan and Nor
dyke allowed Rip Van Haltren to cross
the plate a second time. The scores:

Big Bunch of Tennis Cranks
Weeded Out in First Round
on California Club Court
BIG JIATCH POSTPONED
Carl Gardner Run Down by
Automobile and. Unable
to Play in Park Double*
The first of a series of handicap singles
tournaments for the new: cup- was com
menced on the California Club's courts
yesterday. Of the thirty-two players en
tered but six remained undefeated when
darkness set in. Moulton Warner and Mel
ville Long won semi-final places. W. Mur-
phy, AlberU^rnyan, Harold Gabriel and
â¢Herberf'Lonff^wiil fight it out for the
other two semi-final positions.
Despite the fact that the best players
were placed farther^ behind scratch. than
usual, Murphy is the only player above
scratch who survived the day's play. Of
the men playing 30 3-6 behind scratch H.
Long was, the only one not beaten.*
Harold Gabriel and Melville Long did
remarkably well considering the. odds
they were called upon to concede. Gabriel
owed Blaisdell 30. and gave him 30 and
won in straight sets. Blaisdeli had previ
ously beaten B. F. Nourse with the same
odds in straight sets. In his first match
Gabriel received owe 3-6 from. Carl Gard
ner and the latter, after losing the set by
a narrow margin, defaulted.
The Long brothers did better under han
dicap conditions than was expected. H.
Long gave A. Beyfuss owe odds of 30 3-6
and won easily. After beating two play
ers H. Biddle was taken into camp by
the younger Long in straight sets. The
winner save odds of owe 30. ' .
Murphy won both of his matches with
out losing a set. His victory over Nourse
was rather unexpected, as the latter plays
a steady, safe game. Murphy, unlike
rrOÃt of the poorer players, took all kinds
of chances, and to this, fact he owes his
success. . . . ;
Schmidt and Rolfe each won a match
against big odds and were beaten by play
ers at and below scratch. Warner played
a speedy game against Rolfe and dis
posed of him in straight sets. Kenyon re-.
! celved owe 15 3-C and won two sets out of
I three from Schmidt. The scores follow:

CRACK RUNNERS
CARDED TO GO
Richmond Handicap Attracts
a Field of Live Ones and
Big Doings Are Expected
GOLD ROSE LOOKS GOOD
With but 106 Pounds Up She
Seems to Have a Clear
Title to the Main Event
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29. â Three handi
caps on- to-morrow's card at' Jamaica
will give the form players something
to think about. While the handicaps
are the features of the cardj they are
certainly the most difficult to pick
winners in. The Richmond Handicap
is the only feature, and in it mos;. of
th-3 cracK sprinters at the traqk art
engaged.
The card starts off with a threc
year-old handicap at six furlongs, and
in it top j weights do j not look /cry
promising. My. Uuela is preferred,
with Incantation second \u25a0 and, Ze'ala
third. Mad. Mullah should take the
second event on' his class. He is a
great mudlark, but at the same time
lie has run "several clever races on a
fast track in cheap company.
\u0084 ' /At even' weights and on recent form,
Reidmoore might be selected to win
the third event, but there is no reason
; why hq should be ableto present Don
! Fonso and others with about four
teen, pounds. , The wise ones prefer Don
i Fonso,, with -.Melbourne Nominee sec
ond and : Progress i third. Now that
Gold Rose , has demonstrated that she
; can carry her speed for a mile, it will
be difficult to figure her anything but
the. winner of the Richmond Handicap
With ninety-two pounds up she ran
six furlongs at Jamaica in record tiiiia
and could have beaten the time, s\\a
made considerably had she been
pressed. She has only 106 pounds fj
bother with to-morrow and that should
not trouble her in the least.' Sac Â»â¢â¢>
the choice. ' with Fustian second aiifl
llandzarra third!
Five and a. half furlongs will suit
the Whitney pair better than six fur
longs, and , they . should : go extrpniclly
well in the fourth. The choice is Med
dling Daisy, with the Whitney entry
second and Puntoufle third. Tlie dic
ing event, which is for maiden** m.iy
be- won \u25a0by Roycroft, -as he stiowe'l
speed in his last race and was none
too well handled. Kolaneka should
come second and Gambler third.

which was against the spirit of the sepa

An audience that filled every scat in
the theater saw the.- piece, and gave
laughter throughout.
A concert, the like of which we shall
not soon hear again, was yesterday after
noon's, ' the artists Harold Bauer and
Hugo Htcrmann, the place Lyric Hall.
Nor was the audience, delightfully mu
sical, one that gathers together every day.
It was an audience most sensitively ap
preciative, and enthusiastic as the Tivoll
Latin ever the longest, strongest top note.
In response both artists gave of their
best, magnificently playing a magnificent
programme.
The cream of this was the Kreutzer
sonata, for years before unheard here,
Most interesting was the reading and per
formance, interesting from all sides. In
evitably Bauer was felt to be the bigger
man, his tone challenging even that of
Mr. Hcernjanns "King Stradivarius"; his
reading excelling in meaning, power, in
all beauty. Yet there was delightful ac
cord "in the "feel" of the ! thing. Both
feel their "Beethoven" in the same way;
it is simply that Bauer has the bigger
grasp. As to the rhythmic pattern, the
dynamic balance, these were almost ab
solute. Not a' rain .of the' fine gold of. Mr.
Heermann's violin was lost, not the tiniest
violet phrase of the piano left to bloom
unheard. The variations possibly "at
traded most attention, given with sover
eign directness and clean, sane, tender
charm. The finale the players took at a
terrific tempo and played with tremen
dous sÂ»r>irit.
Mr. Heermann gave "Seul" the prelude:
"Sarabande." double, and "Bouree." from
the second Bach sonata, all with delicious
clarity and taste. Encored he played a
Bach gavotte, receiving again an ovation.
Mr. Bauer's group of solos included the
Lizst Etude in D flat, the Brahms Ca
priccio in B minor and Chopin's Balade
in G miner.- I couldn't help watching the
wheels go round in the Lizst. the little
finger of the right hand, the second (over)
of the left, the thumbsâ everything but
the toesâ v.ooing the melody to the sur
face of that misted sea of accompani
ment, every note a jewel of technique, oh
Lord! The leisurely coquetry of Brahms'
Capriccio was given just that wayâ here's
for ycur luscious staccatiâ and Mr.
Bauer's Ballade of yesterday converted
me wholly to his Chopin. It was an im
perial performance. 7ull of the poetry, the
splendor of ti.e disdainful aristocracy of
this most aristocratic of geniuses. Gluck
and Bolrlln- things he played gs encores,
and could hardly get back of the scenes
even then. Bailer was king of the piano
when he came>here before; he became
emperor -yesteraay. â¢
There was the Caesar Franck sonata to
begin the programme, extremely inter
esting, extremely picturesque. A con
cert, truly, of Concerts.

OAKLAND'S
OFFICIALS
AWAKENED
Illness of Child
to Have Been liesiilt of
Impure Milk and Crusade
lls Begun Against Dairies
DR. BOYES SPEAKS
OPINION VIGOKOUSLY
Says Statistices Show That
Half Million Little Oiies
Are Poisoned \ Yearly hy
the Unscrupulous Dealers
OAKLAND, Oct. 29.â The sudden and
dangerous illness of the 2-year-old* son
of Attorney J. A. -. Taylor, believed to
have been poisoned, by impure milk,
closely following the revelations re
garding the San Francisco milk sup
ply, has aroused the health authorities
and .' physicians of this city. As a re
sult City Veterinarian R. A. Archibald
and Sanitary Inspector Gemmell have
taken samples of the milk supplied . by
all the dairies that do business in Oak
land, but Dr. C. H. Ro we, who | tested
tae samples f' -formaldehyde, failed to
lind any. traces of that poison.
It is the opinion of Dr. E. J. Boyes,
who is attending the Taylor child, that
the lad has been poisoned by milk, but
he does not claim that any adulterant
was used. He believes that the un
sanitary conditions of the average dairy
is responsible for the child's condition.
"Perhaps the gravest danger that is
facing the public, from th^e standpoint
of the public health, Is Impure food,"
said Dr. Boyes in; discussing the case
to-day, "This child'is now hovering be
tween life and death, and, in my opin
ion, his condition iatlue to drinking im
pure milk.
"That there should be such a death
rate of infants is a shame upon civiliza
tion, but it is not all due to the dairy
men, though they are unquestionably
guilty of criminal carelessness. The
general public, respectable and intel
ligent' members of j society, is also re
sponsible. I say the carelessness of the
public is .criminal and I use the word
advisedly. . â¢ .. ; 
"The average milk contains 200,000
bacteria to the cubic centimeter, while
pure milk contains only- from 7000 to
10,000 bacteria.. .. ;
I'The latest- statistics - show that
500,000 children die annually from the
; use of impure "milk. . If. a dairyman or
tiny other citizen went oat on the street
vv It if ii ithotsvn and' killed fifty children
he. would be the victim of a mob, yet
I he j may: serve impure milk that might
kill that number of Infants and noth
ing would be thought of it. \u25a0
"My language may be strong, but it
is time that strong language be used.
Many physicians of Oakland are sup
porting a dairy that lsconducted in. a
sanitary manner and I tell all my pa
tients about it. Perhaps 10 - per cent
of these patients give heed to my warn
ing." The others seem*to \u25a0 think I am a
crank on the subject" and declare that
they purchase only the best of milk.
"The people demand cheap milk) they
pay-for It with the -lives of -their chil
dren. . One-fourth of. the children that
die annually In thin country might be
saved by sanitary reÃulrttlonÂ» in . our
dairies. . .
"The man who conducts a grogshop
and "sells bad whisky . sells ' only to
those who go to his place of business;
the man who sells Impure -milk and he
who buys it is forcing poison and death
upon 1 innocent little ones.".
The recent disclosures across the bay
have thoroughly frightened the house
wives of Oakland and every day sam
ples of - milk are . taken to the Health
Office to be tested. So" far, however, the
chemists have been unable to find a
trace of formaldehyde In the samples
submitted. \u0084
*'The infant child .of .Attorney, and
Mrs. Taylor was better to-day, but he.
is" still in a critical condition and the
physicians have'grdve fears for his re
covery.
TO ERADICATE MILK EVIL.
CitivenM Talk of. Antl-Adnlteratlon Aa
. 'aoelatlon and Prlvnte Laboratory. ;
' The present crusade against the sale
of .adulterated and- poisonous milk to
consumers in " : San Francisco :is likely
to result in the forming -of- an organi
zation; of citizens for. the permanent
stamping out . of this pernicious evil
that the graft system' of administering
the affairs of the municipality, has.al
lowed Ito take such a strong hold. \ It |Is
realized by consumers that the present
burst of activity on behalf of the exist
ing Board of Health is likely to die out
immediately 'after election and condi
tions become as bad as they were be
fore the poisoning of %the â¢ Lent babies
by milk from a dairy that "had an ex
cellent-reputation" with . the depart
ment caused an awakening to the fact
that the milk supply. of San- Francisco
was mostly! unfit for human consump
tion; '\ V â¢:\u25a0'\u25a0:. m ' ' \u25a0 ' '; "\u25a0 : '-' '
.The matter of forming: an association
to work for .'-.the v purification 1 :; of the
milk supply and ; which may extend its
efforts toward driving from ' tho \u25a0; mar
kets all impure food has- been talked of
by ' a number' of citizens ia,nd definite
steps in that direction may bo taken
soon. Just how the work would be carried
on has not yet been, planned inl detail,
but onÂ© suggestion is. that a laboratory
be maintained* by private subscription,
to which any member, of- the associa
tion could take samples. . In Uhls way
a sort of general' ''tab" could be; kept
on the milk from; the various Â»; dairies
and^any of^ them found supplying 'an

James McGregor the Victim
of a Collision in an
Alameda Contest.
James McGregor, a carpenter, resid
ing at 1219 Eighteenth street in this
city, was injured during a friendly
game of football in Alamcda yester
day afternoon. McGregor sustained a
concussion of the brain and he re
ceived his injury in exactly the same
spot where he was struck with a sand
bag by footpads on August 6.* He was
brought to this city and is being treat
ed at the Harbor. Receiving Hospital.
The 'game that was being played
across the bay was between the Vam
pires and "the Eagles. The former Is a
Scottish organization and the Eagles Is
composed of Native Sons. The two
teams have arranged to play a series
of games, and one of these was in
progress when McGregor, playing for
ward for the Vampires, collided with
a member of the other team. McGreg
or was rendered unconscious for a con
siderable time and was later brought
to this city. At, the Harbor Hospital
it was found that the player had been
struck on. the left temple and that he
had sustained concussion of "the brain.

prove serious. The patient has now re
gained consciousness and will be re
moved to "a private hospital.' Last Au
gust McGregor was struck, down by
one of four men near the Hebrew
Home on the -old Mission road, and
robbed of a watch, chain and several,
dollars. At | thaÂ± ) time . his skull was
injured In exactly the same place as It

The surf was much too 'cool for the
