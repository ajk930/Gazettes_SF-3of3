GAVIN M'NAB SAYS THE EXAMINER .SECURED APPOINTMENT OF ALLEGED VENAL COAVWITTEE
Knew He Was Dealing
With Blackmailers.
AND, further, we were positive that this
committee had been appointed at the
instance of the Examiner to persecute
Dr. Dodge and myself. We never contem
plated paying them to stay the pursuit of
their purpose. We had the same interest
in stopping them that we would have in
stopping incendiaries we caught burning
our homes or dealing with men who held
us up at the pistol's point and demanded
the payment of a bribe. lam interested in
good citizenship and in the public welfare.
These are the motives that prompted me to
move against these men. * * * If a gang
of blackmailers is permitted to make re
ports and create false impressions of the
financial condition of corporations there is
little protection forthe community. â¦ * *
We knew that we were dealing with crim
inals, and our interest in the State demand
ed that we take action against these black
mailers. â From testimony of Gavin McXab.
Jordan Is Released on Bail
Furnished by Friends.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 1. â The trial of Senators Emmons, French, Bunkers
and Wright before the bar of the" upper house of the Legislature on charges 'â¢
of bribery has reached a point where a summary of the evidence is permis- *
sible. The guilt of Joseph S. Jordan, who acted as the go-between, has been
established apparently to a certainty and two charges of bribery^ and one
of lobbying, all felonies, are against his name on the police records of Sac-,
ramento.
Senators Emmons and Bunkers, to reach the goal of exoneration, must
beat down the evidence of two men. George N. Tichenor, inspector of the
Continental Building and Loan Association, an^ Henry Hartling, a San
Francisco detective, who was especially employed by Tichenor to aid him in
springing the bribery trap, ' Tichenor has testified as to his dealings with
Joseph S. Jordan whereby it was agreed that he should see the money V;
passed to the accused Senators. He has testified that from vantage points
just across the street he saw Jordan passed what, to thÂ» best of his knowl
edge and. belief, were the bills he had given him for the purpose to Senators
- . - . . .â â¢â â .â  .
- Emmons and Bunkers. -
SAW BILLS PASSED TO TWO SENATORS.
Detective Hartling testified that he stood a short distance away when
both transactions were consummated and that he saw without possibility
of mistake en his part the bills actually pass into the hands of Emmons
and Bunker?. As to French and Wright the evidence is not so clear.
Â« Tichenor admits that the only evidence he has of his contention that
these men received the " bribe money prepared for their entrapment is the
word of Jordan that he had met them and paid them. Jordan . had .
agreed, he testified, that these men should also be paid within his vision,
but a hitch in the arrangements made it impossible, Jordan had told him,
to carry out the plan and Jordan had said he had done the next best
thing. ha<f paid French and Wright thr. moment the opportunity presented
itself. â¢ \ : . . " â ...
, Detective Tichenor testified on the stand to-night that he had not located
any of the marked bills prepared to bring about the doom of the. accused
Senators. Counsel for the prosecution admit that, in fact, none of these bills
has been traced. This is the weakest point in the prosecution's case, but, the
prosecution says, even if these bills cannot be traced if they are necessary, to
a legal conviction of the accused at the bar of the criminal : court, they are [
not necessary to morally establish the guilt and turpitude of the defendant
legislators. /â 
JORDAN IS RELEASED OX BONDS.
The word is around to-night that Ex-Governor James H. = Budd will ar
rive here to-morrow to defend Joseph S. Jordan at the trial of the charges'
against him. Jordan is free to-nieht. having been released on "bonds' fur- .
nished by Frank Wright and William Hanlon. These bonds are for $9000, â¢.
secure the appearance of Jordan to answer to three felony charsres -
against his nameâ of bribery and one of lobbying. The bonds In each
case were fixed by the court at J3OQO. , ;

vestlg-ation "Of the books of the Con
tinental at the instance of the Exam
iner, McNab said that though he had
been informed that the report was fav
orable to the Continental he did not
have the report, but that the same
was in the hands of the enemy. He
further said that he knew the enemy
did not purpose using the same in an j
exploitation of the present standing of
the corporation but to base reports on ]
tfcings that occurred in past years, long
before the present board ' of directors
of the corporation was appointed. He (
knew that these twisted reports were
to be placed in the hands of the com
mittee, four members of which are now
on trial for bribery, and he also knew
that men whose hands were extended
for bribes would make no honest re
port ; that dishonest men do not com
mit honest acts.
In conclusion Nab said that there
had been absolutely no promise on the
part of the Continental to reimburse
those that*, paid the money to entrap
the four accused Senators; that he as ;
one of the directors would not consent
toÂ»such a thing. He could only answer j
positively for himself, but he was cer- I
tain that none of his associates on the
board would vote to repay the money
to those that lost it through the spring
ing of the trap.
It was In- belief that those that
paid it did not want to be reimbursed;
that they were well paid for their loss
by contemplating the fact. that they
had struck a death blow at bribery,
blackmailing and craft. . "
JORDAN MEETS TICHENOR.
Margaret Erhart, who conducts the
house at 1160 Seventh street, at which
Joseph S. Jordan, the go-between,
roomed, was next called. She testified
that on January 24 Tichenor called at
her place . looking for Jordan. Jordan
had told her that he expected . the ar
rival- ol a man and requested her that ;
if he came to ask him to wait. Tichenor j
called twice, finally waiting for Jordan,
who came in a short time after Tiche- ;
nor seated himself. Jordan and Tiche
nor held an extended conversation and ;
then went away together. This was all
she knew. She was not cross-examined.
Hartling, a San Francisco detective,
v ho accompanied Tichenor here to wit
ness the payment of the money to the
accused Senators, was next called to
the stand and proved a strong witness,
After detailing the facts regarding his
employment in the case and telling of
the number of years he has been en
gaged In detective work he got down
to the actual fact* of the alleged brib
ery and told how he had witnessed the
payment by Jordan of $360 each to Sen
ators Emmons and Bunkers.
He told of how after arriving In Sac
ramento Tichenor had some trouble In
locating Jordan, he having been given
the wrong address, but later they
found him, and after several meetings
between Tichenor and Jordan arrange
ments were completed for the payment
to the accused senators of the money
they demanded.
PAYMENT OF THE BRIBE.
"On the evening of the 24th," he
said, "Tichenor .showed me the bills he
was to give to Jordan to hand to these
Senators and instructed me to be sure
to be in a position where I could see
the money pass. 1 took the numbers
of the bills and npted that one bill in
each . package of $350 was initialed.
Shortly after 6 o'clock Tichenor met
Jordan in front of Hanlon's saloon on
K street.' They walked up K street
to Seventh and down Seventh to 1116
and went into the house. They remained
m fifteen or twenty minutes and then
came out. They separated, but later
met near Hanlon's. Tichenor left Jor
dan and he went into Hanlon's saloon.
In a short time he came out, accom
panied by Emmons. They walked
across the street at Eighth and K,
where they met some people and all
proceeded down to 109 Eighth street.
They went in. but in a few minutes
they came out. Jordan and Emmons
valked up Seventh to K. street and
down K. I was right behind them.
When they reached the . cigar store,
a boot forty feet from the corner, they
stepped. Jordan placed his hand in his
right coat pocket, pulled out the bills
and handed them to Emmons. Em
mons put them in his inside pocket and
after a handshake they separated and
Emmons went up the street.
"Jordan crossed the street and Joined
Tichenor and they walked up K street.
After a few minutes' conversation they
again separated and Jordan Joined
Bunkers on the street."
Here Belshaw interrupted to secure
fuller information regarding the posi
tion occupied by the witness to Jordan
and Emmons when the latter was
handed the money by the former, ac
cording to this story. HartlinR paid
that he was within thirty or forty feet
of the men; that, it was about 6:30
o'clock in the. evening and that he
plainly saw the greenbacks handed by
Jordan to Emmons. He said Jordan
had them open in his hand as though
to display to some one the fact that he
was making the payment. This corrob
orates Tichenor's statement â  that he
had arranged with . Jordan that the
payment.be made so he could see that
the dishonest, transaction was honestly
carried out by ,' Jordan. -',
BUNKERS TOOK THE BILLS.
Returning to Bunkers,, the witness
paid he saw Jordan Join. Bunkers and
that they .walked up K street to Eighth.
"I followed," he continued, "keeping
close to them. They turned up Eighth
street and stopped on the edge of th?
sidewalk In front of the American Cash
Store. Bunkers had "â  his - : back < to the

Jordan put his hand into his inside "
<.i.at pocket, withdrew a bundle of bills |
ar'd hmded them to Bunkers. Bunk
, er? plarerl tfeem in his inside coat I
I pocket- and walked away. There was j
Â« vcring < n the bills and they were ;
'â  bo plainly displayed that I had no dif
fii ulty in seeing the transaction. Jor- j
i dan then rejoined Tichenor and I fol- |
lowed them. Jordan left Tichenor on !
; Seventh street. I rejoined Tichenor, j
: and he told me that Jordan had gone i
:to find French and Wright. Tichenor j
i told me to be around and on the look- :
<>ut. Jordan rejoined Tichenor at the j
: Golden Eagle Hotel, where they held a
conversation, and Jordan again left. I j
j went over and Tichenor told me Jordan ,
: had not found the man yet. but would i
dHin. and for me to remain close at ;
hand. Jordan soon came back and !
again left. Tichenor told me that JÂ«.r- i
1 cian said there was going to be a meet- '
ing of the committee at 817 Tenth
; street and that he would see French '
I and Wright there. We walked around â 
Ito locate the place. The meeting was '
scheduled for 7:45. The first person to j
j arrive there was Senator Emmons. I'â 
i moved away and saw Tichenor talking
with Jordan at the corner above.
"Jordan soon left and Tichenor in
formed me that French would come out j
first, when Jordan would pay him, and !
i that Wright would be out later. We i
' then separated and Jordan soon came j
out. Tichenor later informed me Jor
j dan said ho could not get them, that ]
they were busy, but would be down to .
I the Golden Eagle Hotel about 10 j
! o'clock. Jordan did not arrive at the t
! iJolden Kagle at 10, but he came about ]
! 11 o'clock. Jordan and Tichenor walked
down X street toward Sixth. I fol
! lowed right behind.
JORDAN GETS HfS MONEY.
Finally they Btoppgfl and Tichenor
, handed Jordan the bills to be paid to
French and Wright. They then sepa
rated. 1 rejoined Tichenor and he to-ld
' me he had to get another $100 for Jor
: dan. Tichenor again met Jordan at
1 12 o'clock and they held a long conver
! sation. After they separated I re
' joined Tichenor and he told me that
j Jordan had already paid French and
'. Wright. Tichenor then went to the de
pot to get the extra $100 for Jordan. He
came back and showed me the bill and
j I took the number.
Later he was rejoined by Jordan and
they went in front of the Golden Eagle
barber shop, where Tichenor handed
Jordan the $100 bill. They then went
\ across the street to a saloon, where
' they, remained about twenty-five mm,
' utes. When they came out they shook
hands and separated ajid I rejoined
Tichenor. He said our work was com
pleted."
Every effort on the part of Cator to
j break the witness down on cross-ex
| amination failed. The witness was
i sure of his time and of his facts, and
j when Cator saw he was making poor
j headway he turned from this line and
attacked, by imputation, his character.
He was asked if he had not been ac
cused by Judge Ham of Napa of at
tempt at blackmail.
ATTACKS BY IMPUTATION.
â¢ "That is not true and I defy you or
any other man to say it," answered the
witness.
Cator then asked the witness if he
> was not involved in the Little Pete
' bribery case. This was denied and the
witness explained that his only connec
tion with the Little Pete affair was
after he had been murdered and he had
been employed as a detective by the
: defense.
Hartling was then asked if he had
not been accused by Attorney Slessin
â  g-er of testifying falsely in a case.
"Yes, Slessinger accused me of testi
fying falsely in a case when I was
against him," answered the witness,
'and probably you will do the same
thing when I get through with this
: case."
This answer caused much laughter
and Cator was plainly discomfited.
Cator then went into a line of ques
tions regarding which hand each of the
accused used in taking the money given
them.
"Both hands," interjected McNab,
! and again the aud'enee broke into
laughter. Cator then let the witness
i go and an adjournment was taken un
til this evening at 8 o'clock.
Only two new witnesses were called
â  by the prosecution, and it announced
that its case was all in. Moses
Heinze. who received the money from
Grange in the Mills building on Mon
day, wa? one of these. He told of that
; circumstance.
William Russell of the Continental,
! who brought up the extra $100 for
Jordan that was received by Tichenor
at the Southern Pacific depot In this
city on the evening of the passing out
of the bribe money, testified to his trip
here on a late train.
OORBIN IS RECALLED.
William Corbin was recalled by the
prosecution and again made to go over
: a great d^al of the same ground he had
covered at his previous examination.
In addition to this, however, he inter
jected i mysterious stranger into the
â¢ ase, v horn neither he nor any of his
, attorneys seem to know, but Who is
, credited with- being responsible for
I *he clause in ihe affidavit that is to
Ibe stricken out. This stranger fur
nished the one remaining mystery i n
! the case. He floated into the office of
; Mr. 'Y.rbin, whispered a warning of
i dire things to come and then van
1 ished.
"Friday afternoon of last week,"
said Mr. Corbin, "a man called at my
office and said he had noticed the
prosecution of the Continental Build
ing and Ix>an Association by the Ex
aminer. He said he wished to give us
I warning that the Senate Committee on
, Commissions and Retrenchments had
been arranged by Al Murphy of the
i Examiner and that it proposed to
: make a bad showing for the Contin
ental If it could: that Bunkers had
i bwn elected with money furnished by
the Examiner and that Rmmons was
employed by that paper.'
"Who is this man?" asked Cator.
I don't know," replied Corbin. "He
said he was a stranger to me, but that
he wanted to see fair play. I communi
cated with Mr. McNab and told him of
I the circumstances. He said: 'The man
i who told you this evidently told you
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1905.
ACCUSED IT Til TO SHIFT
THE BLAME ON JORDAN.
No Attempt Is Made to Protect him
the truth. I have information that ,
Bunkers, French and Jordan are in i
town trying to drum up business for
the committee.' "
Continuing, Corbin retold the story
of his part in the trap set for the al
leged trribe takers. Cator said he
wished his associate, Copeland, to
cross-examine Corbin, as Copeland had
some data and documents in his pos
session that were necessary to the cross
examination. He said Copeland was ill
and could not be present to-night. In
view of the fact that the accused Sen
ators had three attorneys present the
committee ordered that the cross exam
ination proceed, with the understand
ing: that Copeland might ask what
questtons he wished at the next session.
WARNED BY A STRANGER.
Cator asked the witness particularly
about the mysterious stranger he had
mentioned. "I asked the man his i
name," said Corbin in answer to a
question, "and he said he did not care
to have it known at present. I have ]
never seen him since."
'Wasn't Jordan, was it?" suggested
Cator.
"No, I have seen him since and
know it w.is not him," was the reply.
The witness said the stranger was
about the age of Cator and about his
build, but had a smooth face. He wore ;
a dark suit.
"Did Mr. McNab manifest any sur- I
prise at what you told him?" asked
O.tor.
"No. he said he wasn't surprised at j
all." said Corbin.
"I think that's so," said Cator.
"I hope the editorial remarks of the
attorney will not be made a part of !
the record," said McNab.
"No, they'll be put away on the ahelf j
alongside of yours," replied Cator.
"Is it not a fact that because of this j
controversy with the Examiner these ;
charges were got up by you as the i
oily practical manner of striking back j
and that you got up this scheme for
.that purpose?" asked Cator.
"Wo didn't got up the schemp," re
torted Corhin. "#"lt" # "It is the Examiner
and that crowd that has been schem
ing."
"You make the charge that the Ex- \
amincr is mixed in tin- affairs of this
Committee on Commissions and Re
trenchments," gaid Cator.
"To the best of my knowledge and
belief it is," replied Corbin.
Continuing Corbin said: "I would
never submit to the examination of any
committee that is dishonest."
Asked if he knew any members of
the committee Corbin Bald he knew
none of the accused men, but that he
knew Bauer.
"You mean Bunkers, don't you?"
asked Cator.
"No, Bauer," said Corbin.
DOES NOT KNOW BUNKERS.
"I don't know Bunkers and don't
want to. It is common talk in the
city that the four members of this oom
mittee charged are crooked."
"You would submit to an investiga
tion by them if you thought they would
report your company to be all it should
be, wouldn't you?" was asked.
"I believe that if it had $20 pieces
pi'.ed to the ceiling this committee
would report that the Continental
treasury was empty," replied the wit
ness.
"That might have been true after a
visit of the committee," said McNab.
"Did you care whether the money
ever reached these Senators, as long as
you besmirched them?" asked Cator.
"I would not be the cause of be
smirching any living person unless
they deserved it," said the witness.
Corbin said he had no interest in the
money put up. He would not say that
he "didn't care whether it was lost, as
he didn't like to see anybody lose their
money.
"Do you know Emmons?" was asked.
"Yes, I do," was the reply, "and
there I must correct myself. When
asked if I knew any of the members
of the committee I thought only of
those I knew honorably."
Asked what he knew of Emmons,
Corbin said the Continental had loaned
him money to build a house and that it
now had neither the money nor the
house.
EMMONS IN BAD LIGHT.
"We loaned the money to Mrs. Em
mons rather," said Corbin. "We sent
a check to her, but the contractor did
not use the money as he should and
the house cost more than the money
loaned. Mrs. Emmons indorsed the
check and sent it back marked paid.
The house was half finished and the
contractor said if we would let him
have enough to finish it he would make
the payments. We did so, but he made
no payments. We brought suit for
ejectment. Emmons claimed the money
had never been received by them, but
Mrs. Emmons said she had received
and indorsed the check. Emmons has
been in the house ever since, holding it
on a technicality. He never sued us
as Btated; we sued him."
"well, he beat you, didn't he?" was
asked.
"Yes, but the code happened to be
against us. We should have brought
a suit of foreclosure."
Attorneys McNab and Gould an
nounced that they had no more wit
nesses and Cator took up the cross-ex
amination of Tichenor. One of the
points he tried to settle was whether
Emmons had reached for the money
with both hands, as Mr. McNab had
intimated. It wa* pretty well establish
ed that Emmons had used but one
hand in reaching for whatever Jordan
may have handed him.
Asked for the story of his life, the
witness told of various businesses he
had been engaged in and then entered
upon a period of speculation In San
Francisco. Next he was only a Pull
man conductor. After narrating this
tragedy he was again led over all the
ground covered by himself, Jordan and
the accused Senators during the pass
ing of the money. Cator's effort was
to show that he could not have seen
what moneys were passed because of
the distance he was away and the posi
tions in wMrh the parties stood. ,He
wis asked if he noted the position of
Hartlin at the times the moneys were
paid and said he had not, as he was
too busy keeping his optics on Jordan.
MONEY HANDED TO ACCUSED.
"Are you willing to swear now, know
ing that the liberty of these Senators
may be at stake and considering any
inclination you may have toward that
belief because you saw Jordan put the
money in his pockets, that it was Gov
eminent ! bills \ he : handed to these ac
cused .. men, and â  the â :<â¢ bills ' you 'â¢:-. gave
> him - Cator asked. ' ; -
"To the best ,â  of my knowledge 'â } and
belief the money he handled < IDmmons
and Bunkers was the same rolls 1 I gave
him at his room at 1116 Seventh street,"
was the â¢ reply. ;>; .': T ' ' ;/ ,
Tichenor stated that Senator Bunkers
smiled broadly when he received his
roll from Jordan and seemed filled with :
satisfaction. jB^lffl^'^XW-- -
"Don't you know a man might smile I
at \-. other things besides receiving |
money asked ; Cator. . â¢'. "Jordan ' might \ â¢
have t. been ; : telling M*m: a funny ;â¢ story,
, as he is capable ; of doing:. Maybe r he
told him ; the Continental was going to
put ;' up ; that ten thousand." ::.
; "That J would make anybody smile."
said Tichenor.
The witness refused point blank to
answer any question going into his for
mer^; relations ; with the > Pinkerton
Agency. 4 He â ' even . declined â¢ :. to ' say
whether he knew Emmons i while en- ',
gaged by .' the Pinkertons . at Bakers- I
field. This question was allowed by the
committee, but others were not. and
Cator took an exception, saying he
might appeal to. the Senate.
. DEFENSE ASKS FOR TIME.
J. E. Alexander, â¢ onÂ« of the attor
neys for the ; defense, ; asked that the
case go over : until to-morrow evening.
"We ; have ; been confronted here
with "a" mass i of * secret - testimony, '.V he
said, "and have had no opportunity
to refute it. r We : need a little time . to
make up our line of defense. It may
be that r, we 'â -'â . will call some, witnesses
from Bakersfleld p and Los Angeles.

, .: At the : request of the defense Tiche
i nor and â ; Hartling , will be present at
I the next session for further cross-ex
j amination. ..,::: ./ '
The hearing was continued until to
morrow night at 8 o'clock.
', MAY AMEND AFFIDAVIT. ;
When the : committee opened its
evening I session | Senator Ralston said
he would like to have Mr. McNab make
a further, statement concerning the first
clause *â  of the affidavit ' of : accusation
which intimates that undue influence
was used in appointing the Committee
on Commissions and Retrenchments. 7
â  "It wag never ''â _ the intention." said
Mr. McNab, "to convey by the slightest
word that the president of this Senate
was influenced in the least 1 in the ap
pointment i of this committee. ' We will
withdraw i that part of â¢: the ? affidavit.'
Mr. Cprbin > as the maker ' of It is will
ing; to do this." > -: ' ;; '
"The committee has no right to. with
draw the clause of the* affidavit, but " it
will ask ; the ] permission i of ; the ; Senate
to do so â  to-morrow," said Chairman
; Belshaw. "If you will file \ with V the
committee , in writing what you desire
It will be attended to." v . - , , â }
"The defense ; has some rights in this
matter," said t. Attorney Cator. "The
Senate itself has no 'â right to , expunge
from . a record the statement j of j people
not' members. It is to our interest to
have this affidavit ;: remain as ' it is."
McNab was told to put I in writing
what :. he wished done, and i promised
to do so. â¢ Cator said he "> would 1 protest
against the elimination of I the J clause
referred to. . ." . -
ALLEGED INCONSISTENCY.
The last of the witness' testimony
established an inconsistency between
his 'â ! statements and those of Detective
Hartling that : was eagerly, seized - ' by
Attorney - Cator. I Tichenor '; said he
handed the bills with which t the Sen
ators were to be bribed to Jordan, ! done
up i in rolls. So j far as he could ' see, ; he
being located across the street, in both
instances, the j bills .â¢ were ' still : in ;â  rolls
when J they were handed to â¢; Emmons
and Bunkers. Hartling-, who testified
that "â  he s was a short distance â ' * ; away
when the bills were handed to the Sen
ators,' said they were not ; rolled ' ; up,
but were ; handed out full length, r so
that he had no difficulty in recognizing
them. The defense proceeded, ; how
ever, and in forcing from Tichenor a
further admission weakened this point.
Tlchenor, in answer to questions, ad
mitted i that ; if ; the . passing ; of what he
believed, from : the position â¢ he occu
pied, to be bills was a v transaction be
tween p strangers, : he J would ? not have
been i able, \ to identify the object that
passed as paper money. ! " j\ -â :â¢ :\^r..;\ \:^-
This elated the defense, but ; when it
comes to the argument : the i prosecution "
will point out that this admission upon
the f part of Tichenor 'â¢ strengthens its
i theory r that Jordan i unrolled the bills
after receiving them from Tichenor
â  and thus Tichenor's testimony operates
. as ;' corroborative : of Hartling's v ': testi
; mony that > the v.' bills I. were 7 handed - out
unrolled ; and easily identified. ;- ; :
ACCEPTS JORDAN'S \ WORD. .â¢ -h â 
As to the guilt of French and, Wright,

was Jordan's i word 5 that J he had paid

be an honest f * man, one whose word
could be taken in such a case, Tichenor
said that ' so : far as i carrying â¢ out his
part of ,; the compact i was * concerned i
â  he had i, found Jordan t to '% be 'j honest,
or, in other words, that f he was ; a' dis- : )

to Come Up for Final Read
ing in Assembly To-Day
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. I.âThe Yo
semite re-cession bill will be ifaken up
by the Assembly to-morrow morning.
After a lengthy debate this morning j
the lower house voted to put it on the |
head of the third reading or final j
passage file for that time. Several mo-!
tions fixing days for hearing it were ,
put. One, by Jones of Tuolumne, to lay !
the matter over for a week was beaten. â 
This is an indication that the Assem- |
bly is in favor of re-cession, as he leads \
the opposition. The motion to take up J
the bill to-morow was adopted as a
compromise, however. Amerige was its
author.
The matter came up on Estudillo's
motion to rush his amendment protect
ing vested rights in case of re-cession to
the printer and have the bill consid
ered at the afternoon session.
The Society of California Pioneers
presented a petition through Speaker
Prescott that the Legislature appro
priate a sum sufficient to place in the
National Statuary Museum at Wash- |
lngton statues of John A. Sutter and j
James Lick, the society deeming them '
the most illustriously connected with
the State's foundation.
Espey demanded that his bill prohib
iting puol selling be taken from the
hands of the Committee on Public
Morals (Lucey chairman) and given to
come other committee. He intimated
i that the Public Morals Committee was
delaying the matter of reporting the j
bill back. Tt was evident he feared it I
. would be smothered in the committee. |
! On motion of Stanton Espey's motion
was laid on the table.
Treadwell's bill giving the Board of |
Harbor Commissioners of San Fran
cisco permission to lease certain blocks j
on the water front waa taken from the
hands of the Committee on Commerce
and Navigation at the author's re
quest and otherwise referred.
Bliss introduced a bill providing that
the female ward at the Mendocino
State Hospital for the Insane be trans
formed into a prison hospital for in
sane convicts.
An appropriation of $15,000 to estab
lish a California exhibit at the interna
tional exposition to be held at Liege,
Belgium, this year, and giving ihe
Governor power to appoint a Commis
sioner at a salary of $250 a month,
was introduced by Meincke.
At the request of the California Pro
motion Committee Vogel introduced a
measure making green and gold the
State colors.
Creighton introduced a bill provid
ing for the appointment of another
Superior Judge for Shasta County.
Charged With Stealing Tools.
Samuel R. Haynes was booked last

NEW COMMITTEE
IS APPOINTED
President of Senate Names
Five Members to Investi
gate Continental's* Affairs
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. I.â President of
the Senate Anderson, acting under Sen- i
ator Ralston's resolution, passed yester
day, appointed to-day a special com
mittee to investigate the affairs of the
Continental Building and Loan Aaao- !
ciation, or any other similar organiza
tion. The special committee will take
the place of the Committee on Commis
sions and Retrenchment, a majority of
the members of which are now on the
defensive. The new committee consists
of Senators Woodward, Curtin, Hahn,
Anderson and Lynch.
An extended debate took place in the
Senate to-day, when a bill introduced
by Senator Hahn of Los Angeles came
up for final passage. The bill adds a
new section to v the Penal Code, as fol
lows:
Any person, pÂ«rsonÂ» or corporation who
allows a minor under the age of â¢i*hteei
years to visit & saloon, gambling-house or
other Immoral place, kept, leased, owned, con
ducted or controlled by any such person, per
sons .or corporation, is grullty of a mlade
meanor. .
Senator Selvage of Humboldt County
' made a vigorous assault upon the bill,
I contending that if it were passed and
! became a law it would keep young men
from engaging in business. He held
that under the provisions of the bill it
would be unlawful for grocery clerks,
drug clerks, newspaper carriers, mes
senger boys and others to deliver goods
or messages.
Senator Shortridge of Santa Clara de
! clarea that the bill was of the Sunday -
I school brand of legislation. Proceeding,
| Shortridge said he did not want any
boy of his watched. He believed the
Senators would be better off if they at
tended to their own business. The cities
! of the coast were able, he declared, to
: grind out ordinances for their own pro
, tection.
At the request of the author the mat
ter was continued until to-morrow.
A bill was introduced in the Senate
this morning by Senator Rush of So
lano County to put a stop to coursing
'â  matches. The bill makes It a misde
meanor to take hares, to have hares in
one's possession or to offer hares for
sale to be used for coursing. It also
i makes it a misdemeanor for any person
! to train dogs for coursing purposes.
The Senate to-day passed Senator
Hahn's bill providing for the appoint
ment and employment of the attaches
of the District Court of Appeals and for
their salaries. The bill provides for
each court a clerk at $2400 per annum,
one stenographer, to be a deputy clerk,
at $1800, and a bailiff at $1200.
Carter of Los Angeles Introduced a
bill adding a new section to the Penal
Code making it a misdemeanor for a
husband to desert his wife when she
has no means of support at the time
of such desertion. Another bill, bear
ing upon the same subject and intro
duced by Carter, provides that when
a man does desert his wife he may be
fined from $500 to $5000, and that 90 per
cent of such fine shall be paid to the
wife.
Senator Leavitt introduced a couple
of bills ln the Senate of which Lieu
tenant Governor Md&n Anderson is
paid to be the author. One of the bills
provides for the opening of the Legis
ature on the first Monday after the
first day of February "instead" of the
Srst of January, as at present.
The other bill makes a large number
jf the attaches statutory officers of
the Senate and Assembly. This In

IS INDICTED
FOR BRIBERY
Federal Grand Jury Returns
True Bill Alleging That
Oregon* Senator Accepted
$4200 From Timber Dealer
PAID TO INFLUENCE
* LAND COMMISSIONER
(har^e Is Made That in
His Official Capacity He
Aided in Securing Patents
on Fraudulent Affidavits
5 PORTLAND, Or., Feb. Interest in
the land fraud cases was again raised
to fever heat by the announcement
that the Federal Grand Jury had late
to-day indicted United States. Senator
John H. Mitchell on another charge of
bribery, and had : also indicted State
Senator George C. Brownell, one of the
foremost Republican i politicians and
lawyers in this State, on charges of
subornation of perjury.
The Indictment against Mitchell al
. leges that while a Senator from this
State to the Federal Congress he ac
â¢ cepted on seven different occasions
rum* of money aggregating $4200 from
a* timber land dealer named Frederick
R. Kribs for services rendered in, it is
. alleged, inducing Congressman Binger
Hermann," then Commissioner of the
General Land Office at Washington, to
expedite, make special and approve
certain applications for public lands,
and recommend the issuing of patents
to the lands.
The â¢ indictment against * Senator
Brownell charges that Brownell caused
Fred Slevers and John Howland to ;
swear falsely that certain field notes in j
connection with the survey of public i
lands in Eastern Oregon were true. '<
Specifically the indictment against
Senator Mitchell recites that Kribs
was engaged in the business of procur
ing and aiding persons making appli
cations to purcbase tracts of land In
the . Roseburgr land district in this
State and also aiding them to secure
the lands by means of alleged false
statements that they were not apply
ing for them on speculation. â¢
â¦ PAID TO USL. INFLUENCE.
After going on to say that the ser
vices o/ Congressman Hermann, as
â¢ssioner of the General Land Of
fice, were necessary in having the ap
â  plications expedited and having the
patents issued, the indictment says
that Frederick K. Kribs contracted for
ihe services of Jobn H. Mitchell and
A. H. Tanner, law partners, and agreed
to pay them for services rendered in
part by Mitchell appearing before and
persuading* Binder Hermann, Commis
sioner of the General Land Office, to
ma!;e special, expedite and approve the '
applications and claims and recom- â 
mend the issuance of patents upon !
them .â they were lawful and j
botm-fide applications and claims. The
indictment states that the United' ;
Slates Government was directly inter
ested in these latter and that the ser- i
vScvs were to be performed by Mitchell
â while a Senator from this State. The '
(meat then makes the charge that
in consideration of these services Kribs
gave Mitchell two checks for $r,OO each
orra Roseburg (Or.) bank on February
13. 1002; :v, o checks on the same bank
on June 14. 1902. for $1000 each; one
clieck on September 20. 1902. for $500: ;
wo:i(Â»w o:i(Â» check on January 4. 1904, for $500,
end Tie check* on October 8, 1904,
for $200. ,'
r . STATE SENATOR INDICTED.
The indictment against Senator
Mitchell involves the same district In
vhich the forged applications for sur
veys were made upon which ex-Sur
veyor General Henry Meldrum was
**onvicted last year. It charges that
Brownell entered into, a conspiracy
Tvith Malcolm* S. McKeon and Rufus
. S. Moore, deputy surveyors, and Henry
Irum. Surveyor General of the
United States (or the State of Oregon,
to defraud the Government of public
land by procuring surveys to be made
of the land In a manner prejudicial
tv the administration of the law; caus- ,
â¢3 Fred Flevers and John How- i
land, axmen, to take oath before him I
as notary public that they had ap- !
i peared before Brownell In his official !
capacity es^a notary on December 13, 'â 
1901* and swear to a final oath of as- ;
felstants in the official field notes, which '
ttated that the survey had been m all
respects well and faithfully surveyed
and the corner monuments established
aecouding to law.
The indictment* alleges* that Slevers
'-lowland did not make the oath j
in good faith and that they so swore .
because Brownell had instigated them [
to do so, and that Brownell well knew i
that the -oaths were 'untrue.

BISHOP CONATY
ENTERS DENIAL
Says Bard's Charges Rela
tive to Distribution of
Indian Funds Are Absurd
NO PROMISE OF SUPPORT
Declares That Informant of
Senator Is Old Offender
Against Catholic Church
LOS ANGELES, Feb. I.â Right Rev.
Thomas W. Conaty, Bishop of this
RoniP.n Catholic diocese, to-day entered
an emphatic denial to the charges made
yesterday in Washington by United
States Senator Bard that the Roman
Catholic church had endeavored to in
fluence the Senator's action in the mat
ter of distribution" of Indian funds by
the promise of political support.
"The charges are absurd," said the
Bishop. "In the first place, they cannot
apply to this district, because we do not
receive any Government funds for use
in the schools. We take care of our
Indians with our own money. The
Catholic church does nothing that is
not open and aboveboard, and the
statement that a representative of a
Cathoiic association promised to carry
certain districts for Senator Bard in
consideration of a continuation of fa
vorable contracts is ridiculously ab
surd."
The Bishop stated that Scharf, whom
Senator Bard said was his informant,
was an old offender against the Cathb
lic church and had caused previous
trouble by false representations regard
ing his connection with Catholic insti
tutions and influence among Catholics.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. â Cardinal
Gibbon* has sent the following state
ment to the representative of the Bu
reau of Catholic Indian Missions in
this city for presentation to he Sen
ate Committee on Indian Affairs:
BALTIMORE. February 1, 1905.
In view of certain statements made by Sen
ator Bard before the Committee on Indian Af
fajrs of the Senate I deem it proper to stats
that the Catholic church has no political agent
at tVasflington or anywhere else; that Profes
sor E. L. Scbartf, who Is referred to in Sen
ator Bard's statement. Is not a member of the
Catholic church or of the Bureau of Catholic
Indian Missions and has never been employed
by the church or by the Catholic Indian Bu
reau In any way whatsoever.

Missions.
CORPORATION BILL FAVORED.
Committee to Advocate Measure Re,
quiring Annual Report.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. â The
House Committee on Judiciary * to
day authorized a favorable report on
the bill requiring all corporations en
gaged in interstate commerce to make
an annual report to the Commissioner
of Corporations of the Department of
Commerce and Labor. The bill was
amended in committee so as not to
interfere or conflict with any require
ments in this respect originally con
tained in the act creating the depart
ment. An amendment was also placed
in the bill exempting common carriers
from its operation, as railroads are
required to report to the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
The reports required by the bill are
to be filed by February 1 of .each
year, covering the year preceding De
cember 31. The information is to
contain the name of the corporation,
the statute under which organized,
constituent companies, amount and
value of stocks and bonds and prop
erty constituting the capitalization,
elements upon which the market
value of same is fixed, earning capac
ity, name and address of each officer,
rules and regulation of business. The
return is to be made under oath, and
failure to do so lays the corporation
liable to a restraining order from en
gaging in business until the report is
made.
NEW FORESTRY RUL.ES.
President Places Bureau Under De-
partment of Agriculture.
WASHINGTON, Feb. I.â The Presi
dent to-day signed a bill which imme
diately transfers the administration of
the federal forest reserves, including
timber sales, applications for the free
use of timber and permits for grazing
livestock, from the Department of the
Interior to the Department of Agricul
ture. By the terms of the act, all offi
cers and employes of the Forest Re
serve Service, a force numbering 430
men, are transferred to the Department
of Agriculture.
The regulations relating to the free
use and sale of timber and to the graz
ing of livestock will be revised at an
early date. Meantime, the present rules
will remain in force except those relat
ing to the receipt and transmitted of
money. Hereafter special agents of the
Department of Agriculture will perform
the services hitherto rendered by the
receivers of the local land offices. The
new law affects the administration of
more than fifty million acres of public
lands throughout the United States and
Alaska.
SIX -MILLION DEFICIT
FOR MONTH OF JANUARY
Government Expenditure* Shown to
Be Far in Excess of the
Receipt*.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. â The
monthly comparative statement of the
Government receipts and expenditures
shows that for the month of January,
1905, the receipts were $43,410,285 and
the expenditures $49,628,299, leaving a
deficit for the month of $6,218,014.
The monthly statement of the public
debt, issued to-day, shows that at the
close of business January 31, 1905, the
debt, less cash in the treasury,
amounted to $989,929,619, which is an
ircrease for the month of $4,380,298.
This increase is principally accounted
for by the decrease in the amount of
cash on hand. The debt proper shows
a decrease for the month of $1,586,595.

BRISK DEBATE
ON STATEHOOD
Teller and Dillingham Come
Forward With Conflicting
Views Before the Senate
MANY BILLS PASSED
Committee Named to Confer
With the House on- the
Measure Affecting Miles
WASHINGTON, Feb. I.â Clark of
Montana, Dilllngham and Teller to-day
continued the discussion of the joint
statehood bill, Dlllingham supporting
the measure as it stands and the oth^r
two Senators contending for amend
ments and the right of the four Terri
tories to be admitted as so many States.
In his reply to Dillingham, Teller
charged that Vermont had retrograded,
and quoted figures to show that there
had been a falling off in the value and
number of farms in that St;>Â«>. Dilllng
ham replied that thl6 condition was due
to consolidation of some of the farms.
Dillingham supported the proposition
for the consolidation of the four Terri
tories into two States, antagonizing all
the amendments for a greater number
of States. He contended that conditions
in Arizona and New Mexico were not
such as to justify separate statehood.
Teller, replying to Dlllingham, said
that the people of Arizona and New
Mexico had not progressed as rapidly
as they would have done under a State
form of government. He said that ac
cording to the statistical abstract the
par value of farms in Vermont, Dil
lingham's State, had decreased between
1890 and 1900 to the extent of $30,000,000.
Proctor reported the agricultural ap
propriation bill arid gave notice that
to-morrow he would ask to have it con
sidered. The following bills were
passed:
Amending the land laws so as to per
mit settlers on the public lands to make
transfers for public 4ises before com
pleting title.
Amending existing laws so as to re
quire captains of passenger vessels to
supply information regarding the age
and sex of immigrants, in accordance
\lith the requirements of the Secretary
tor Commerce and Labor.
Establishing a light and fog signal
station at Point Cabrillo, Cal.
The Senate to-day resolved to Insist
upon its amendments to the army ap
propriation bill, and Proctor, Scott and
Cockrell were appointed conferees on
the part of the Senate. The principal
item in dispute is that relating to the
assignment of retired army officers to
duty with State militia.
TO IX>WER DOCKAGE FEES.
Department Orders Change Made at
Bremerton Yard.
WASHINGTON, Feb. I.â Assistant
Secretary Darling of the Navy had a
brief conference with the President to
day, bringing to his attention some de
partmental matters. A few weeks ago
the Boston Steamship Company, which
operates a line of steamships between
the Pacific Coast and the Philippine
Islands, complained to the Navy De
partment and to the President that the
charges of the Bremerton naval sta
tion, on Puset Sound, for the dockage
of ships were excessive. The statement
was made that the ships could be dock
ed at Esquimalt, British Columbia, for
about one-third of the charges at Bre
merton. The steamship company de
sired to have repairs made to one of its
big vessels, the Shawmut, at the Amer
ican yard, but objection to the high
charges was made.
After considering the charges Assist
ant Secretary Darling has decided to
order a reduction of the charge to less
than 50 per cent of the old rates for
ships of or more than 4000 tons. This
concession, it is believed, will be satis
factory to the vessel owners.
CHANGES NAVAL PERSONNEL.
Bill Reorganizing Present System In
troduced in the House.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. â Repre
sentative Foss of Illinois introduced a
bill to-day to "reorganize and increase
the efficiency of the personnel of the
fleet of the United States." The bill
shortens the course at the naval acad
emy until 1913 to three years. One
year's sea duty cfter graduation is
required Instead of two, as at pres
ent. The age of midshipmen entering
the academy is fixed at from 16 to 17
years.
The bill creates a "reserve list," on
which captains who have reached the
age of 60 years shall be placed. This
age limit is gradually to be reduced
jto 55 years. Commanders are put on
I this list at the age of 55, the age
j thereafter being reduced to 50. Of
| fleers on the reserve list, are to per
: form shore duty only and every trans
i fer of an officer to this list shall ere
: ate a vacancy on the active list. Two
j grades of vice admiral are created.

Strife Mnst Continue Until

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING
WASHINGTON, Feb. I.â lf there is
talk anywhere of a compromise be
tween the President and the great rail
roads over the question of having the
Government regulate rates, such talk
is not heard in Washington, where the
discussion is all of war. This war is
being carried into the Republican cau
cus of the House, which/ has been called
for Friday afternoon. It had been sup
posed the fight was all over in the
House and that the Hepburn bill would
be reported. > This is the bill to which
the railroads had agreed, with the un
derstanding that it should pass the
House only to be killed in the Senate,
and many of the railroad representa
tives went home last Sunday.
All was serene until the Democrats
forced the Republicans to report the
Esch-Townsend bill, which has a string
to it. Then came the speech of the
President in Philadelphia, in which he
made known his intention to appeal to
the country for help to get a law which
would permit the Interstate Commerce
Commission to make rates.
This has caused the entire railroad
world to fly to arms once more and to
prepare to fight the President at every
turn until Congress adjourns unless he
recede from his position of insisting
upon a bill which carries out his dlc
i turnâ that in some such body as the
j Interstate Commerce Commission there
j must be lodged in effective shape the
\ power to establish rates.
In every cranny and corner of the
House wing of the Capitol to-day this
disposition of the railroads, to fight the
Esch-Townsend bill was the one thing
being discussed. More important than
this was the public announcement in
the House by Representative Sibley of
Pennsylvania that Congress might be
proceeding too hastily In this matter
and that itjj/as a doubtful expedient
to lodge such power in the Interstate
Commerce Commission. Sibley's speech
is regarded in Washington as showing
the renewed hostility of the Pennsylva
nia Railroad system to legislation in
either branch of Congress so long as
the President insists upon the enact
ment of a bill to have the Government
regulate rates.
The other Pennsylvania members
known to be opposed to the Esch-
Townsend bill are Dalzell, Mahon, Huff
and Castor. All are Republicans, and
they probably will make known their
opposition in the eaucuÂ«.
The Postofflce appropriation bill oc
cupied the attention of the House the
greater portion of the day. The usual
annual fight on special mail facilities
on trunk lines made its appearance.
Moon of Tennessee arraigned those
Democrats supporting the proposition,
at the same time inveighing against
the Republican party for its attitude
regarding subsidies in general.
The bill was amended in several Dar
ticuiars, the most important change
consisting of the transfer of the inspec
tion service of the department from
the Fourth Assistant's office to that of
the Postmaster General. There was
added $10,000 to the appropriation of
$2,700,000 for rent and light and fuel for
first, second and third class offices. The
period for the weighing of mails under
the quadrennial requirement as the
basis for the adjustment of transpor
tation pay was extended from thirty
to ninety days.
Baker of New York, discussing the
railroad rate question, attacked Sec
retary of the Navy -Morton, who. he
said, was a self-confessed violator of
the law.
"We are told there should be a
square deal." he said in sarcasm, but.
he alleged, the cards were stacked "in
the interest of the men that control the
great railroads of the country."
Incidentally Baker declared that "the
innocence of the members of the House
regarding restricting the railroads is*
accounted for by the little cardcases
In their pockets."
Army Orders.
WASHINGTON. Feb. I.â By order of
the War Department a board of offi
cers is appointed to meet at 9 o'clock
a. m. on March 1, 1905, at the Presidio

PLEA FOR AID
IN A BOTTLE
Message Discovered on Long
Beach Tells of Man and
Son Marooned on Island
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. I.â Midway be
tween Long Beach and San Pedro, this
afternoon, C. H. Goodwin of the former
city picked up a bottle which was
rioating in the surf near the beach. It
contained a message which is either
an appeal for help from a man. who
by this time may be starving, or a
hoax^ Whatever it may be it will be
investigated. The message reads:
JANUARY 20, 19C5. â To whoever picks up
this bottle: Stranger, ws are alone on San
Nicolas Island. We came here in a small
boat; ehe has gone adrift. JOE TODD.
San Francisco Cal., 1011 Golden Gate avÂ»
r.ue, is the address of my mother. My son is
with me. We are all well and have food for
a week if no help comes.
The message was taken to Long
Beach and turned over to the authori
ties, who communicated with the ad
dress given therein, but no reply has
been received. Whether a vessel will
be sent to investigate the truth of the
message is not known, but if it is
learned from San Francisco that a man
and his son are missing and that the
correct address has been given there,
a schooner will be sent to the island at
once.
San Nicolas Island Is a bleak and
barren spot about eighty miles almost
southwest of San Pedro. It is seldom
visited except by abalone fishermen or
exploring parties, who go there to* dig
for relics of the race which once in
habited the place. A fine collection of
these relics was secured there last sum
mer for the Smithsonian Institution.
So frequently have similar messages
in bottles been picked up along the
southern coast during the past several
years, which upon investigation have
proved to be canards, that the Long
Beach authorities are hesitating about
making the long trip to the island be
fore they hear from the San Francisco
address.
Some confirmation is given to the
message, however, by the Tact that a
week ago a small boat which has not
yet been claimed washed ashore near
Alamitos Beach, south of Long Beach.
No one by the namÂ« of Todd lives at
1011 Golden Gate avenue, this city, and
no one could be found there last night
who knew of anything about the al
leged "Joe" Todd, his mother or his
son.
KAISER IS LESSENING

Frowns Upon Proposed Equestrian
Festival Because of Its Great

BERLIN, Feb. I.â Upon Emperor
William's request the so-called eaues

The Duke of Ratibor and General yon
Plesgen had asked the Emperor to be

WESTERN CONGRESSMAN
WARNS MEN OF THE EAST
If Wool Be Pnt Upon thÂ« Free List,
Woolens Also Must Go
Tliere.
BOSTON, Feb. 1. â Congressmen
James T. McCleary of Minnesota and
Washington Gardiner of Michigan were
guests of the National Association of
Wool Manufacturers at a dinner in the
Hotel Somerset to-night and discussed
the tariff question, arguing against free
hides and free wool. Congressman Mc-
Cleary said:
"If the people of the East put wool
on the free list we of the West will
put woolens on the free list. The day
you put hides on the free list we will
put the finished product on the free
list."
Congressman Gardiner said that there
had never been a time after a tariff
revision when business had not suffer
ed. The Western farmer had once been
ruined by free wool and did not wish
to repeat the experienoe.

Oh arriving there the workmen were
admitted to one of the halls of the
palace. The Emperor entered the
hall, accompanied by Grand Duke
-George Michaelovitch, General Hesse,
the minister of the imperial court and
the commandant of the palace. The
.workmen bowed- deeply to, the Em

CZAR'S HEALTH IS DRUNK.
At the conclusion of this speech the
Emperor told the members of the
deputation to communicate his words
to their comrades and said he would
supply them with printed copies of his
address.
After leaving the palace the deputa
tion proceeded to â  a neighboring
church, where they prayed, and, after
kissing ikons, placed lighted candles,
before the shrines. Subsequently they
were given dinners in a building which
formerly was the high school of
Tsarskoe-Selo. One of the members
of the deputation proposed the health
of the Emperor, which was drunk with
cheers. .
At 4:30 o'clock the delegates drove
to the imperial pavilion, whence they
tock a train for St. Petersburg.
It is extremely, significant that, fol
lowing the press interview with .Grand
Duke Vladimir yesterday morning,
Souvourin, editor of the Novoe Vremya,
fn that paper this morning came out
strongly in favor of a Zemsky Zabor
(old Land Parliament), which he de
clares will not only maintain but will
strengthen autocracy. It would be a
channel of communication between the
sovereign and the people, without which
it would be impossible to have lasting
reforms.
PRINCE MIRSKY FORCED OUT. .
The retirement of Interior Minister
Sviatopolk-Mirsky was officially an
nounced to-day, ill health being as
signed as the reason. Durnovo, former
Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, be
comes acting Minister of the Interior.
Bouligan, former Governor General of
Moe.ow, seems most likely to be Prince
Sviatopolk-Mirsky's successor, but no
decision has yet been reached. The gos
sips are saying that Emperor Nicholas
has offered the portfolio to Witte, presi
dent of the Committee of Ministers.
Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky's desire to
retire had been known for weeks, but
the manner in which it was announced
was unusual, the retirement of a Min
ister being generally accomplished by
an imperial rescript. For this reason
the form of the announcement is popu
larly accepted as a reprimand. Among
the extreme reactionaries, and even
among some of the more modern con
servatives. Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky
has been blamed for having from the
very outset of his career encouraged all
eorte of liberal aspirations, which, be
ing Impossible of immediate realiza
tion, brought the present storm about
the head of the Government.
The current gossip to the effect that
Bouligan, former Governor of Moscow,
will succeed Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky
is another straw tending to confirm
the surmise that Grand Duke Sergius'
influence is dominant The appoint
ment oi General Trepoff to the Gov
ernor Generalship of St. Petersburg,
who was a Sergius nominee, narrowed
the power of the Minister of the In
tr-rior, and, it is believed, precipitated
Prince Sviatopolky-Mirsky's resigna
tion, and that those who are posted
should pick another Moscow man and
a friend of Grand Duke Sergius to re
ceive this portfolio indicates a grow
ing appreciation of the influence of the
Emperor's uncle.

not to apply the penaltl"s for wasted time; not
to endeavor to discover the instigators and
leaders of the strike nor to employ special
measures against them and to collect funds
for the support of the families of the victim*;
and in this respect it makes no difference be

Fourth, the association, in order not to create

ODESSA, Feb. 1. â Near the Dolice
station here to-day Chief of Police
Galovine was shot in the right shoul

WARSAW, Feb. I.â Warsaw at Dres
ent is quiet. Traffic and business have
been partially resumed. The shoos in
the principal thoroughfares are still
boarded up, and but few soldiers are
visible in the streets. Public and of
ficial confidence, however, is not re
stored and there is a degree of uncer
tainty regarding the situation. To
morrow is the holiday of the purifica
tion and demonstrations are feared. No
settlement of the strike is expected be
fore February 8. It is certain that the
strikers will not return to work before
then.
Outside of Warsaw the strike move
ment appears to be growing, but while
a great number ol workmen are out
at Ledz, not a single case of disorder
has been reported there.
It is rumored to-night that thousands
of workmen in the extensive coal dis
tricts of Dombreya, near the frontier,
will strike to-morrow. This would be
extremely serious, as the mines would
immediately be flooded if the pumping
ceased.
MOSCOW. Feb. I.â ln view of the
opening of the Assembly of the Pro
vincial Nobility to-morrow two drafts
of resolutions are in circulation, one
insisting on the absolute maintenance
of the autocracy and the other asking
for political freedom for Russia, urg
ing the Government to make necessary
changes in the laws to enable a repre
sentative Assembly to be convoked,
and appealing to the throne to issue a
manifesto assuring the country of its
intention to take steps to this end,
without which it will be Impossible to
restore tranquillity to the country.
Forty-two members of the Douma,
which wag in session to-day, submitted
a resolution demanding that the Gov
ernment permit the publication in the
newspapers of full reports of the pro
ceedings of the Douma. which hitherto
have been censored freely.
LIBAU, Feb. I.â The Government to
day received a deputation of strikers
and urged them to return to work as
precedent to securing any concessions.
Street demonstrations ceased this
evening. The strikers appear to be
willing to resume work.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. I.âRepre
sentatives of the scientific institutions
of secondary schools have published a
memorandum complaining of the de
plorable condition of public education
in Russia, and declaring that it can be
remedied only by the institution of a
representative government.
SARATOFF, Feb. I.â The railway
workers have resumed their labors.
The schools will reopen on February 3.
WAS VICTIM OP RIOT.
British Consul in Warsaw Not At
tacked by Cossacks.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 1. â The
preliminary report of the attack made
upon British Consul General Murray
aVid Pro-Consul Muckuain at War
saw has put another complexion upon
the affair. According to the report,
which has already been communicated
to Sir Charles Hardinge, the British
Embassador, the Consuls were in a
crowd in the street while it was being
cleared, the Pro-Consul receiving a
cut on the forehead, but whether from
a Cossack saber or a club in the hands
of one of the rioters has not yet been
definitely established.
The Consuls were not attacked,
since the action of the Cossacks was
not especially directed against them.
CLAMOR AGAINST RUSSIA.
Italian Socialist Deputies Interpellate
the Foreign Minister.
ROME, Feb. I.â Foreign Minister
Tittoni, replying in the Chamber of
Deputies to-day in an interpellation
of the Socialists, who wished to know
"if the Government felt it to be its
duty to interpret to the Government
of the Emperor of Russia the senti
ments of indignation and horror which
prevailed throughout Italy at the
slaughter at St. Petersburg on Janu
ary 22," said he declined to make any
reply. This aroused uproarious pro
tests from the extreme Left and Signor
Bisolati (Socialist) cried:
"Shame! You also refused to for
ward to the Government of the Em
peror of Russia a petition signed by
over a hundred Deputies praying for
the release of Maxim Gorky."
To this the Foreign Minister an
swered:
"In acting as I have done I felt that
I represent the opinion of the majority
of the Chamber and of the people."
This called forth further and louder
protests from the extreme Left.

BLOOD FREEZES IN WOUNDS
OF STRICKEN SOLDIERS.
COLD TORTURES THE DYING
Surgeons Compelled to Wear Mittens inTreat
ing Men on the Hun River Battlefield.
RUSSIAN HEADQUARTERS. HU
NAN MOUNTAIN, Feb. I.â The five
days' battle on the Hun River has
yielded no palpable result, both sides
practically maintaining their former
positions, though it is true that at a
heavy cost the Russians succeeded in
driving the .Japanese out of the ad
vanced position and repelling their
flanking column. The Russian cavalry
proved extremely efficient. There li
again a lull In the conflict, and it ft
expected military operations will be
suspended until the end of February.
The combat which will go d6wn in
history as the battle of the Hun River
was fought out on a seemingly unend
ing plain, which is broken only by
the Southern Amethyst Mountains
around Yentai, the solitary eminence of
which Is the Liaoyang tower of bloody
memory. The bright glare of the sun
reflected from a dazzling expanse of
snow was- painful to the eyes, and' it
was with difficulty that one could fol
low here and there black streaks mark
ing the Russian columns or wavering
skirmish lines dashing against what
resembled dull gray rocks, but which,
in reality, were the villages of Lidia
tun ' and Tanlepu and the extensive
hamlet of SandepaS, bastioned by Chi
nese defenses and converted by the
Japanese into veritable fortresses. Ex'
posed to the intense coJd of a Man
'churian winter, the mounds of earth
had become like granite and as impen
etrable as the steel sides of a modern
battleship.
For five days Russian soldiers hurled
themselvns against the defense^ and
the artillery pounded them until the
frosty air reverberated with the thun
der of cannon, the din of bursting
shells and the rattle of musketry: but
neither steel-pointed shell nor nickel
bullets availed against the frozen
earthworks. The gunners actually
wept with despair at the impotence of
the attack. Mortar batteries came up
at a gallop in the hope uf demolishing
the fortifications. Night and day the
stream of shells was poured against
the earthworks, but it had but very
little e*fect.
Men seomed indifferent to hunger
and cold, which latter was of Arctic
intensity. Their fingers, hands and feet
were benumbed, while stinging snow
and dust blinded them.
The slightest wuund caused excru
ciating pain. Warm blood no sooner
exuded from lacerated flesh than it be
gan to freeze. The wounded could not
be left exposed, and if they did not re
ceive attention within nn hour they
died. The surgeons, their assistants
and nurses were almost powerless in
the bandaging of wounds, for they
were obliged to wear leather gloves or
mittens in order to resist the cold.
Thâ¬ men seemed to bo living again
the horrors of the winter campaign
of 1812 against the Turks. Everything
that could be done was done, but man
was powerless in the face of nature,
which heaped tortures upon the troops
and defeated the well-thought-out
plan of the commander.
STEAMSHIP SIAM A PRIZE.
Austrian Blockade Runner Captured
by Japanese.
TOKIO, Feb. I.â The Austrian steam
ship Siam, bound for Vladivostok from
Cardiff with coal, was seized off Hok
kaido Island yesterday.
The Emperor has issued a rescript to
Field Marshal Oyama's army thanking
the troops for defeating a superior Rus
sian force in the recent battles. Oyama,
responding, says the men fought des
perately day and night in Intensely
cold weather.
Field Marshal Oyama reporting yes
terday said that the Russians bom
barded his center and right wing on
January 30 and sent small bodies of in
fantry to attack the Japanese outposts,
where they were repulsed. On the same
day heavy Russian guns fiercely shelled
PiyÂ«ntai and Chenchiehpao.
On January 31 the Russians bombard
ed Chenchiehpao, Lapati and Litajen
tan, and two companies of infantry at
tacked Chenchiehpao, advancing from
the south end, near Peltaitzu. The
Japanese repulsed them.
On January 30 two companies of Rus
sian infantry unsuccessfully attacked
Yatxupao, two miles northwest of
Chenchiehpao, and two battalions of
Russian Infantry and a regiment of
cavalry failed in an attack on Tu
taltzu
Field Marshal Oyama in reporting the
wounding of Lieutenant General Mist
chenko, of which he had learned from
Russian prisoners, characterized Gen
eral Mistchenko's attacks upon the
Japanese flank as brave.
Admiral will return to his flag
ship February 6. The immediate naval

MARVELS OF FTELD SURGERY.
Japanese Hospital Staffs Give the
World an Object Lesson.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Feb. I.â Japanese field surgeons
and field hospitals have accomplished a
triumph, according- to statistics ob
tained from the chiel surgeon of dfcn
eral Oku's army.
There have been in the entire army
since the landing on May 6 only forty
deaths from disease. The figures show
that up to December 1 there were
treated 24,642 cases of disease. Of
these forty resulted fatally, 18,578 pa
tients recovered, 5609 were sent to Ja
pan and the remainder were undergo
ing treatment when the figures were
compiled. It is believed that these fig
ures are unequaled in the history of
warfare.
There were only 193 cases of typhoid
and 342 of dysentery, while of beri
beri there were 5070. The other cases
of disease were not serious.
The casualties in General Oku's
army from May 6 to December 19 were
as follows:
Killedâ Officers, 210; men, 4917.
Woundedâ Officer*. 743; men, 20,337,
Missingâ Officers, 4; men, 482.
Sixteen per oent of the wounded died,
19 per cent recovered on the field and
JBS per cent were sent to Japan.
Eighty-five per cent of the wounds
were inflicted by rifle shots, 8 per cent
by artillery and 7 per cent by cold
steel.
The largest percentage of recoveries
was in the cases of chest wounds.
Most of the recoveries were due to tne
small caliber of the rifle bullets.
The percentages of the other Jap
anese armies are beliered to bÂ« about
the same.

The main events in the Interior of
Russia have been published in the of

shown to be entirely independent of

A. large part of the wounded are be

hospitals and trains are filled and tnÂ«

Ministry to Retain Power Until Rus-

LONDON, Feb. I.â W. L. A. Burdett-
Coutts, M. P.. speaking in the West
minster Conservative Club to-night,
said the Conservative party would re
main io office until the Russo-Japanese,
â war was concluded and predicted" the
ending of that conflict during the com
ing summer. He said the Anglo-Jap
anese alliance was tne most prescient
act of foreign policy ever achieved by
Great Britain and Premier Balfour was
bound by every consideration of honor
and patriotism to remain in office dur
ing the critical period, "when, the war
being closed, other powers might step
in and perhaps rob our ajly as shame
lessly as they robbed Japan before."
With the closing of the war, the
speaker said, would come a period of
fine diplomacy and it was impossible
that the time should find the country
in the throes of a general election.

Vajrue Reports From the Front.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. I.â From

not clear yet whether the fighting on
the Hun River is ended. The Russians

Divinity School Professor
Says Statutory Prohibi

TEACHINGS OF CHRIST

Special ptaiMttch to ThÂ» Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. I.â "Statutory prohi
bition of divorce was never divine law.
It is a mistake to believe that Christ
was opposed to divorce. He merely set
forth an ideal in regard to marriage,
not a written law against divorce"
This statement wads made by Assist
ant Professor Clyde A. Votaw of the
University of Chicago, one of the pil
lars af the Midway Divinity School. In
an address to the theological students
to-day. Bible" references wÂ«rÂ« used* to
prove his opinion. They wÂ«rs as fol
lows: Matthew, v:3l-32: Matthew.
xlx:3-Â»; Mark, x:l-12; Lake, xvt:lÃ.
"The fact seems to be that Jesus in
his teaching concerning marriage is
dealing with the principle and Meal of
marriage rather than enacting legal
statutes in regard to it," explained Dr. '
Votaw. "The whole treatment of hjs
words as marriage legislation, which .
began with his disciples and which con
tinued to this day, is a big mistake and
has led te great confusion, hardship,
contradictions and strife.
"His teaching must not be regarded
as statutory, nor divorce aa never per
missible. But the act of divorce is a â 
confession of complete^ failure to attain
the ideal."

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Y*vr People Know How Useful It Is In
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
l coal is th* safest and most efficient
i disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
! few realize ita value when taken Into
the human aysteia for the same cleans-
ing purpose. .
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It is not a
I drug at all, but simply absorbs the
j gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and Intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking- or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion. It whitens Â£he
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious rases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they â¢
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form, or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lo2enges, the charcoal being mixei
â¢with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will .
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the .general health, better com- .
plÂ«xion, sweeter breath and purer
blcod, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but. on the contrary,
gTeat benefit.
A Buffalo physician. In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to ktl
I patients suffering from gas in stomach.
' and bowels, and to clear the complex-
\ ion and purify the breath, mouth and
I throat; I also believe the liver is grÂ«at-
; ly benefited by the daily use of them:
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and, although in some
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal, in
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
any of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

FOR FAIR PLAY
\a\\w Grgapusitions to Get
Behind Alva Adams in the
('(dorado Election Contest
APPEAL FOX NEW LAWS
One of the Ballots Declared
Fraudulent by Experts
Identified by the Voter
DENVER, Feb. I.â A call has been
made by labor organizations of this
cuy for mass meetings of Liberty
leagues throughout the State to "de
mand fair play" for Governor Adams
Jn the settlement of the contest isti
tuted by Former Governor Peabody
for the office of Governor. The Lib
erty leagues were organized during the
late campaign, and their membership
consists mainly of union workmen.
Several labor unions have adopted
resolutions asking the Legislature to
dismiss the. gubernatorial contest.
Resolutions adopted by the Carpenters'
Union of this city declare that "the
investigation beggars all description
for falsehood and baseless innuendos,
perjury and corruption, and is â  only
intended to det-uive the public by car
rying out a gigantic conspiracy against
th* people under cover of a righteous
indignation against knowp election
practices."
Curtailment of the powers of the
Governor of this State is the demand
of IS.OOO members of organized labor
embodied in a petition from the Den
ver Trades and La,bor Assembly pre
sented to the Legislature to-day.
"Under the construction of the Su
preme Court on the question of habeas
corpus,' says the petition, "no man is
safe."
With the petition is presented the
draft of two constitutional amend
ments. One of these makes it impera
tive for the Governor to call a special
session of the Legislature within for
ty-eight hours after calling out
the militia and submit his action to it
for approval, and that the Legislature
shall remain in session wto+te martial
law is in force. The second amend
ment provides that the privilege *of
the writ of habeas corpus shall never
be suspended except in the case of in
vasion, insurrection and rebellion, and
then only by the Legislature. It also
declares that Ihe military shall always
be subservient to the civil authorities.
There was a dramatic scene this aft
ernoon in the committee room where
the gubernatorial contest is being
heard, when Fred Hummel, a Demo
cratic committeeman, identified his
ballot from a bunch of seventy or
eighty wnich an expert had reported
were fraudulent. Hummel gave the
number of his ballot and wrote the
word "Democratic " as he had written
it in the election booth.
"Look over these ballots and pick
out yours," said Attorney Ward, for
the contestants. Hummel began to
turn over the ballots, rapidly scanning
each.
"This is my ballot," said Hummel,
straightening up.
The ballet vas turned and on the
reverse side was found the number
II Inch corresponded to that in the poll
Dook.
To-day marked the opening of Gov
ernor Adams' side of ihe contest.
At the night session of the commit
tee a number of residents, of Precinct
11, Ward 7, identified ballots included
in the list of those declared to be
fraudulent by Expert Hanna as having
been cast by them. On cross-exami
nation these witnesses were required to
write for comparison words appearing
on the ballots. William Hummel,
Democratic judge of this precinct, tes
tified that he assisted about fifteen per
sons to prepare their ballots and that
about twenty-five in all were aided by
election officials. He identified bal
lots of two persons assisted who were
present as witnesses, but failed to sep
arate any others from the bunch de
clared fraudulent by the expert. In
the precinct in question the expert re
ported seventy-three ballots written in
similar handwriting.

Well Use Our War Vessels
WASHINGTON. Feb. I.â ln report
ing to the House to-day the bill agreed
on by the Merchant Marine Commis
sion, with favorable recommendation
of the House Committee on Merchant
Marine and Fisheries, Chairman Gros
venor makes some caustic comments
on the Condition of American shipping.
He says that foreign shipping competi
tors are scarcely rivals; they are
"triumphant enemies, triumphing over
the disaster that has com- to Ameri
can enterprises and rejoicing in the
utter inability of the American people
to wisely expend their own money."
Again he says:
This biil has stirred the sluggish blood in
our foreign competitors and they see in it
danger to their supremacy. Asknowledging
our triumphant rivalry in â¢ all branches of
buelcMS and commerce with the exception of
this one, England has glpated over our weak-
Bess in this respect.
Comment is made on the hundred
million dollar naval bill, with the con
clusion that "no nation was" ever dom
inant on the sea in time" of war that
was not strong on the sea in time of
peace in its merchant marine." In con
clusion the report says:
We applaud the splendid achievements Of
Japan on the sea, and yet without her mer
chant marine Japan 1 would be powerless t->
| have delivered the overwhelming b!ow that she
. has upon her adversary. England is mighty in
her war navy because she la mighty in her
merchant marine. Russia presents a singular
contrast, and Russia is weak in her merchant
marine.
If vrar should come to-day we have not ten
ships in cur merchant marine fit to be taken
over by the Government for war purposes and
we could not man with efficient Â«ailors onf
half the battleships, cruisers and torpedo
boats of our vplendid navy.
The merchant ratrine is a hand maiden of
the war navy and no nation ever achieved
greatnets in one direction which was not
ttrong in the other.
CHECK ON CABINET MEN.
Bill to Imprison Those Who Spend
More Than Appropriations.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. â In its re
port to the House to-day asking fa
vorable consideration of the bill im
posing a penalty of a $2000 fine and
two years' imprisonment on officers of
the executive departments of the Gov
ernment who expend sums in excess of
appropriations or make the Govern
ment liable for such sums through
contracts, the Judiciary Committee
says:
The < penal clause -la rendered imperatively
necessary by reason of the fact that a vicious
and unlawful ' practice of extending appropria
tions by various departments is growing- rap
idly, which the present law, â  without r entitles
for violation, does- not seem to have succeeded
In preventing. Â ./ ' . ' '

We enormously, inspect rigidly and condition our cigars scien-
tifically. Our system brings the smoker closer to the sources of pro-
duction, and assures better cigars and more dependable quality than can â¢
be obtained in any other way. By our system, we cut out five distinct
; ; " in-between " profits. We put the saving into the quality of our cigars.
We sell everything from Cuba's best and costliest product down to. â¢
' the little short smokes at a penny each. j

SANA FE'S
CASE GOES
INTO COURT
Government to Prosecute
the Kailroad Company for
an Alleged Violation of
the Anti - Rebate Law
SDeclal DiSDatch to Th- Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. I.â Prosecution
of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railroad and" the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company for violation of the
Elkins anti-rebate law will be recom
mended in a report by the Interstate
Commerce Commission which will be
made to Attorney General Moody to
morrow. The report will declare that
gross violation of the law has be- Â»
practiced by these corporations, and th
fact that the commission unanimously
signed the report, wnich was written
by Judge Prnuty, indicates that conclu
sive evidence must have been obtained.
The investigation by the commission
convinced the Commissioners that the
Santa Fe system has discriminated in
favor of the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company for many years.
The evidence supplied by W. B.
Biddle, freight traffic manager of the
Santa Fe. who shouldered all the re
sponsibility, although Paul Morton,
now Secretary of the Navy, was in
control of the traffic department of
the Santa Fe when the secret rebate
arrangement was entered into, was re
garded by the commission as sufficient
of itself to prove violation of the law.
This case is regarded by members
of the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion as one of the most important it
has had to deal with in many years.
All of the testimony has been printed
and will be at the disposal of Congress
and the Attorney General.
On receipt of the report Attorney
General Moody will at once institute
proceedings against the Santa Fe.

ILLINOIS HAS
BIG SCANDAL
Charges That Legislature
Is Public Auction to Be
Thoroughly Investigated
SPRINGFIELD, HI., Feb. I.â An up
heaval in the Illinois Legislature, pos
sibly rivaling the recent boodling dis
closures in the Legislature of Missouri,
may be the outcome of an address
made by Representative Frank D.
Comerford of Chicago to the students
of the Illinois College of Law recently.
The General Assembly to-day appoint
ed a committee of seven to investigate
Comerford's charges, which are report
ed as specifically alleging 'that the Il
linois Legislature is a great public auc
tion, where special privileges are sold
to the highest corporation bidders,"
and that, 'without respect to party af
filiations, the 'grafters' seem to be in
the majority."
For the first time in the history of
the Legislature of Illinois in many
years members of the General Assem
bly are armed. Threats have been
made against Representative Comer
ford, who acknowledges that he car
ries a revolver in his pocket to defend
himself in an emergency.
James Burdette, a reporter for a Chi
cago paper, was knocked down just
outside the entrance of the Leland Ho
tel by friends of one of the accused
members.
The investigating committee this af
ternoon immediately went into execu
tive session. Soon afterward Repre
sentative Comerford was technically
placed under arrest and summoned to
appear before the committee. Comer
ford protested strongly^ against an ex
ecutive session, but the committee not
withstanding voted to exclude the
press.
Comerford was finally allowed until
that time to prepare his case.and he
immediately left for Chicago. Comer
ford says he will be prepared on Mon
day to substantiate the one charge
made against members of the present
Assembly â that affecting the alleged
use of money in a party caucus.
This evening a number of representa
tives of Chicago newspapers were sub
penaed to appear before the committee
and tell what they know concerning
the manner in which Comerford's
speech got into newspaper men's hands.
Five reporters were called, one by one.
and questioned as to how the Comer
ford matter was obtained. Three of the
men questioned by the committee were
unable to answer, and the other two
declined to give the source of their in
formation.
It is possible that several professors
of the law school at which Comerford
delivered the lecture will be subpenaed
to appear before the committee to tell
in what manner it was given publicity.
Tailor-Made Servant Girls.
A great change was noticeable in
the garb worn by the servants solicit
ing hire at the Carlisle hiring fair.
A few years ago the women and grirls
came flaunting into the city on a hir
ing day in tawdry finery of a frequent
ly ridiculous type, but on Saturday
there was none of this. In fact, in
their smart tailor-made costumes it
was difficult to distinguish them at
times from the ordinary city girl. â

ANOTHER DELAY
IN WEBER CASE
Continued Illness of Juror
Berry Wil^ Necessitate
a Further Postponement
Special Dispatch to The CalL
AUBURN, Feb. 1. â The opening of
the Weber case set for 9 o'clock to
morrow morning will be deferred.
This is occasioned by the continued illâ
nes sof Juryman T. W. Berry. As soon
as Judge Prewett learned this he re
quested counsel on. both sides of the
case to meet him to-night to discuss
the advisability of selecting a new juror
in order that the case might go on
at once without further delay. The
lawyers were present at the appointed
time, but could not come to an agree
ment.
Judge Prewett said that he desired
the case to proced as rapidly as pos
sible as the county was under heavy
expense, and, as over 100 witnesses,
many from long distances, were here
waiting to give their testimony. He
was in favor of selecting a new juror
f.t once to fill Berry's place. He an
nounced that court would convene at 9
o'clock to-morrow morning, when he
will listen to arguments on this ques
tion.
Adolph Weber is feeling better to
day. All the hotels are overcrowded
with witnesses and others who are in
terested in the case.

FATHER CUTS
OFF HIS SON
Declares the Law Shall Take
Its Course in the Case of
a Young Belgian Prisoner
REFUSES TO GIVE HELP
Deportation Laws to Be In
voked to Bid Country of
Youth Who Turned Thief
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 1.
"Let the law take its course," was the
reply of Eugene Legros' father to the
Inquiry from the Belgian Consul, who
sent to Brussels on behalf of the young
foreigner, who is under arrest on a
charge of stealing valuable bric-a-brac
from Brigadier General Oscar F. Long.
When the complaint, changed to a
charge of grand larceny, was read to
day Legros broke down and cried. He
feels that his father has cast him *>ut.
The prisoner, if he be convicted of the
crime with which he is charged, will be
subject to the operation of the Federal
deportation laws. These provide that a
person who shall have been convicted
of a felony within one year after nib
arrival in the United States shall be
deported to the country from which ho
came.
Prosecuting Attorney A. P. Leach
said advantage would be taken of that
law and an effort would be made to re
turn Legros to his own country-
Legros served in the Long household
as a valet. He is a linguist and bears
all of the marks of refinement and cul
ture. His people are said to be well-to
do. They reside 1n the Belgian capital.
The father is interested In marine ship
ping enterprises. Legros' preliminary
examination was set for February be
fore Police Judge Mortimer Smith.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1905.
MAJOR PICO DIES AFTER
LONG AND USEFUL LIFE
Last Scion of Noted Mexican
Family Reaches Ripe Age.
LAST REPRESENTATIVE OF FAMOUS SPANISH FAMILY. WHO DIED YES
TERDAY IN ALAMEDA. HIS ANCESTORS PLAYED PROMINENT PARTS
UNDER THE MEXICAN REGIME IN CALIFORNIA.
ALAMEDA, Feb. I.â Major Jose Ra
mon Pico, the last of the distinguished
Spanish family that gave to California
iis last Governor under Mexican rule
and its first Lieutenant Governor un
der United States sovereignty, passed
nway shortly before noon to-day at
his residence, 1922 Broadway, age 78
years. Death was due to gangrene of
the left foot, which resulted from an
old wound.
Jose Ramon Pico was born in San
Jose in 1826, his father being General
Antonio Maria Pico, who commanded
the Mexican troops In California during
the war between the United States and
Mexico. Pio Pico, the last Mexi
can Governor of California, was an un
cle of Major Pico, and Dolores Pico of
Castile and California was his grand
father. Dolores Pico came to California
in 1761 with a commission from the
King of Spain to establish missions and
conquer the Indians.
General Pico, Major Picons sire, was
one of the signers of the treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo and became a good
American citizen after California
passed under control of the United
States. He died impoverished, but full
of honors, and to the last retained the
pride of his high-born race and re
fused to learn the language of his con
querors.
Major Pico served as a lieutenant in
the Mexican war under his father and
participated In several battles with the
American troops commanded by Gen
eral John C. Fremont. At the outbreak
of the Civil War he organized and
equipped four troops for the First
United States Cavalry. After seeing
much serlvce against the Indians he
retired from the army In 1867 with the
rank of major. After years of legisla
tive effort Major Pico was awarded
$8000 by the State of California for the
assistance he had given the Northern
cause during the Civil War.
At one time the Picos were owners
of vast grants of land throughout Cal
ifornia, located principally in the south.
These all passed to the possession of
tV hustling and business bent gringo,
leaving their original possessors but lit
tle better off for having owned them.
Major Pico was twice married, his
second wedding took place twenty-two
years ago. He is survived by his sec
ond wife, Mrs. Jennie Hutchinson Pico,
and two daughters by his first wife,
Mrs. C. T. Bell and Mrs. D. I. Pico,
both of Los Angeles.
Major Pico was a tynica/ Spanish
cavalier of the old school â proud, hos
pitable, simple and frank. He had all
that grace of carriage and gesture,
charm of voice and diction, imperious
ness and dignity of spirit that were the
embodiment of the historic Spanish
grandee. He was of large and impos
ing physique and sprightly for one of
his advanced years. Major Pico was a
member of the Grand Army of the Re
public, and was never more delighted
that when harking back to the days
before the gringo came and telling of
the parts he played in the Mexican and
Civil wars.
Major Pico's funeral will be held from
St. Claire's Church, Santa Clara, Fri
day morning, and his body will be laid
at rest beside the remains of his fore
bears in the old cemetery in the mis
sion town.

Dr. Yon Adelnng Says Milk
Condition Has Been Very
Bad in City of Oakland
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 1.
The Board of Health has requested
the City Council to enact an ordinance
providing for inspection of dairies and
Imposing a license fee of Jl a month on
each dairy to meet the salary of a dairy
inspector. In a letter to John L- Ho
ard. chairman of the finance committee
of the City Council, Dr. Edward yon
Adelung, the Health Officer, has urged
the prime importance of such an in
spection and declares that recent in
vestigations of dairy conditions show
that the milk of the city has been "six
hundred times too dirty."
Dr. yon Adelung lays special stress
upon the license fee as necessary to the
success of this sanitary move. He
points out that there are no municipal
funds available with which to pay the
inspector's salary and that this fiat rate
fee has been established because the
graded figure suggested has been de
clared illegal by the City Attorney.
Touching the health department's ob
servations among the dairies. Dr. yon
Adelung writes:
A short time ago this department made In
veitlgatlons Into the milk conditions in the
rity and found them very bad. Th<?Â«Â« reports
were published. These investl&atlnns showed
clearly that uncleanllnes* prevailed. ThÂ» con
dition was gummed up aa follows: "ThÂ« num
ber of bacteria is taken as an Index of clean
lines* of milk. The average of milk now de
livered Is represented by the figure* HOO.OOO.
By ordinary cleanliness, viz: by cleaning the
udders, washing the milkers 1 hands, boiling
the mtlk pails and cooling the milk as soon
as milked that figure. 600.000. dwindled to
less than 1000. In plain language, our milk
Is 600 times too dirty."
The letter was read and referred to
the finance committee.
The Council made a permanent posi
tion of the street Inspector, under the
style of deputy superintendent of
streets, at a monthly saiary of $125. The
incumbent is W. W. Blair.
BIGAMY CHARGE
AGAINST HOCH
List of Wives of Chicago
Bluebeard Said to Eeach
as High as Twenty-Nine
CHICAGO. Feb. I.â Two indictments
charging bigamy were voted against
Johann Hoch by the Grand Jury to
day. Three of Hoch's supposed wives
were witnesses before the Grand Jury.
When at the Criminal Court building
waiting to appear before the Grand
Jury the three women met each other
for the first time. They shook hand*
and congratulated each other over their
escape from Hcch.
Four supposed wives of Johann Hoch
have been discovered since yesterday.
The total is, now twenty-nine, not
counting two in Brooklyn, regarding
whom the police have heard only ru
mors. The "new wives" are Mrs.
Loughken-Hoch, said to have wedtled
Hoch in San Francisco four years aga
and to have died suddenly: Mrs. Hulda
Nagel-Hoch of St. Paul, and Mrs. Hen
ry Bartel-Hoch and Mrs. Fred Doess-
Hoch, both of Cincinnati.
The* three wives of Johann Hoch who
appeared before the Grand Jury to-day
are Mrs. Marie Emily Fisher, Mrs.
Anna Hendrickson and Mrs. Marie
Goerk. Each was accompanied by a
marriage certificate.
CINCINNATI, Feb. I.â lt is thought
here that Johann Schmitt, who resided
in this city seven years ago, and Jo
hann Hoch of Chicago are one and the
same. Schmitt's career In Cincinnati
lasted from the middle of the year
1896 through 1897 and in that time he
married, four months after the death
of her husband, Mrs. Henry Bartel. A
few months after her death, which is
said to have been mysterious, he mar
ried Mrs. Fred Doess, widow of a sa-
loon-keeper. Mrs. Doess-Schmitt aft
erward married again and now lives in
Hamilton, Ohio, where she identified a
photograph of Hoch as that of Schmitt.
ST. PAUL, Feb. I.â lt is believed
here that Johann Hoch is the same
man who married a Mrs. Hulda Nagel
of St. Paul In May, 1902. under the
name of Otto yon Kern, a Bavarian
Count. Soon after the wedding the
Count requested his wife to turn cer
trin real estate into cash. While the
bride was downtown shopping prepar
atory to a trip abroad, for which the
"Count" aC the same time was sup
posed to be getting tickets, her trunk
containing $3000 was broken Into and
robbed of Its contents. The "Count"
then disappeared.
Mrs. Alma Beschorner. a sister of
Mra. I* agel, says she I Mieves. from
having seen Hoch's portrait in the
papers, that he is the man who mar
ried her sister.

ERECT NEW SCHOOLHOUSE
Board of Education Points With Pride
to Work Being DonÂ© on
Berjcerot Building.
The members of the Board of Ethi
cation are Jubilant over the faot that
the new four-room Bergerot school
building, now i n course of erection
on Twenty-third avenue, near LakÂ«
street, is being built entirely by civil
service artisans. School Director
Boyle stated yesterday that it is thÂ«
first school building to bÂ« so erected
out of the current funds of the de
partment. The estimate of cost Is
$1500. but the mechanics arÂ« vying'
with themselves in th*ir efforts to
brin^r the cost within the sum noted,
thus contraverting the assertions from *
some quarters that the building couli
not be bnilt for that amount. It will
be completed In ten days and will
prove a boon to the pupils in the Rich
mond District, who are now housed
in separate and unsanitary rooms.
School Director Roncoviari, Super

GERMANS RAISE
GRAIN DUTIES
Big Increase in the Tariff
in Commercial Treaties
Reported to the Reichstag
TO AID AGRICULTURE
Difficulty Encountered in
the Negotiations With
Both Austria and Russia
BERLIN, Feb. Iâ Chancellor yon
Bulow, in submitting the commercial
treaties to the Reichstag to-day, said
he would not go into details, but would
make general observations. The un
| favorable condition with agriculture in
Germany, compared with manufactur
ing, was shown by the transfer of the
population from the country to the
cities. Tn 18T1 64 per cent of the popu
! lation lived In parishes of less than
1 2000. In 1595 the cities and country
: were equal, while to-day 54 per cent
| live in the cities. Germany Is not es
1 sentially an industrial state, he said,
but an agricultural and Industrial
state.
Wide territories in Germany, espe
cially in the northeast, south, south
west and in Bavaria, rely on agTicul
ture. The flourishing development of .
industry has limited and checked ag- ,
riculture. Agriculture in Germany is \
pick, said Bulow. These treaties were j
designed to equalize the development
and to assist agriculture. For this
purpose, the Chancellor said, higher
ciuties on grain and animal industries
are necessary.
Count yon Bulow admitted that the
scale of minimum duties for the four
principal kinds of grain were put into
the tariff law at his wish, in order to
nhow foreign states when negotiating-
Dew treaties that Germany could not
accept lower grain duties than these.
He also admitted that negotiations,
especially with Russia and Austria-
Hursjrary, were exceedingly difficult,
since those countries had been injured
by Germany's agrarian duties and ob
jected to the treaties -in the interests
of their farmers.
The duties as fixed, the Chancellor
continued, are equivalent to an in- j
crease of 43 per cent on rye, 67 per cent
on wheat. 76 per cent on oats and 100 :
per cent on barley. Referring to the
increase in the duty on maize from 1 ;
mark V* pfennigs a metric hundred- â 
weight to 3 marks, the Chancellor said:
"We need little maize, and the Increase
of duty will enlarge the demand for '
fe<Â»d barley."
Count yon Bulow confessed that Ger
many, in order to get the treaties re
newed, had beÂ«Â»n compelled to accept
considerable increases in industrial
duties from Russia and other states.
He warned the Reichstag against ex
ae-^rorating the increases and calling
them prohibitive. "Individual duties
may have a prohibitive effect," he
said, "but this is not true of the ma
jority."
He said the increases on iron goods,
machinery and chemicals were heavy,
but if Germany's Commissioner had
d^mardod more favorable terms it
would have been impossible to make
any treaties whatever. He announced
that Russia, in renewing the treaty
with Germany, accepted the BrusseK
sugar convention and also agreed to
treat G*rman Jewish commercial trav
elers the same as other Germane.
Chancellor yon Bulow announced
that the treaties will go Into effect
on February 12, IW6.

NEW YORK, Feb. I.â Charles W.

extensive bank consolidation plan in
this city, who has long been the central
figure in one of the most sensational
matrimonial tangles of recent years,
arrived here to-day on the steamship

Europe. Mrs. Clemence Cowles Dodge
Morse, the millionaire's wife, did not
accompany her husband. Morse said
that he had returned to answer any
charges that may be made.
During the absence of Morse the long
and searching investigation of the
Dodge divorce reached a point where
the Grand Jury of New York< County
returned criminal indictments against
at least half a dozen persons, among
them two lawyers of wide prominence.
Some of the indictments returned by
tht Grand Jury have not yet been
made public and it is believed that
further sensational developments will
quickly follow.
No announcement officially had been
made as to what course the authorities
having the Dodge-Morse tangle investi
gation in hand will pursue, but it is be
lieved that an attempt will be made
to supplement the evidence already in
possession of the District Attorney's
office by requiring the appearance and
testimony of Morse.

MUTE ROUNDER
LOSES CASH.
Swears Danseiase Stole It
She Is Chagrined by Accusation
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Miss Lillle Hojrt flatly denied the ac
cusation of dishonesty filed against her
by Richard H. Boyne. a deaf mute, who
specifically alleged that she had ab
stracted from one of his pockets the sum
of $160 while he was pleasuring in the
Cascade dance hall, on Pacific street,
where she was the stellar feminine at
traction. While the charge was per
fectly silly, she averred, and of her tri
umphant acquittal no sensible person
could entertain the least doubt, still she
was annoyed by the disparaging reflec
tion it east upon her sense of self-es
teem. Any one who reads of her arrest
and does not know her personally may
be led to imagine that she exercises but
scant discrimination in her professional
capacity of entertainerâ that all mas
cuiine visitors to the Cascade look alike
to her so long as they have money to
spend, and that she treats the lame,
the halt and the blind, not mentioning
the deaf and dumb, with the same cor
diality that she extends to phe sound of
limb and wind. She would not deny
that there were ladies whose avarice
led them to Ignore the physical and
mental defects to which she had al
luded, but they had not attained her
peerless position. Her reputation would
be incalculably damaged by conviction
on the charge entered by this complain
ant, and she was certain that even the
acquittal of which she felt assured
would not undo all the mischief that
had been effected hy her arrest.
Then th* silent accuser told his story
with his hands. Police Sergeant Green
serving as interpreter. Not only had
he been most genially received by Miss
Hoyt, he swore, but from the moment
he entered the Cascade until he missed
his money she was constantly by his
side. Despite the fact that she did not
understand his mute language she ex
perienced no difficulty in conveying to
him the intelligence that it was his
duty to purchase drinks, nor did he
have much trouble irt convincing her
that her charms had enslaved him. He
was satisfied that she robbed him of
the $160, because no other person had
opportunity to do so.
Judge Fritz will hear more about It
to-morrow.

Daniel McCarthy, whose abundant
: hair drooped in matted festoons over
a crimsoned countenace. darkly hinted
at police pilfering. When arrested for
: vagTancy by Patrolman Nelson, he
i averred, there was a dime and two
! nickels in one of his vest pockets, and
| an inventory of his cash an hour later
j disclosed the fact that it had been re
! duc>?d to 15 cents, although he had not
, spent any money during the interim.
, While he did not feel justified In openly
| accusing his captor of knowing the
1 whereabouts of the missing nickel,
[ neither could he perish a cankering sus
picion its whereabouts was known to
that person. Would Judge Fritz kindly
I order an immediate investigation of the
matter? The Judge said he would, and
then he sentenced Mr. McCarthy to ten
days' imprisonment to keep him clear of
intimidation or bribe-offering while the
latest police scandal is being probed.

I her presence by announcing that she
IfJesired to be driven at once to the
' County Jail, as experience had taught
her that only there could she avoid a
threatening attack of delirium tremens.
Judge Mogan asked her if six months
would serve her purpose, and she re
j plied that she could get along Just as
well on a five months' sentence, so five
months she got.

Kate Sullivan, accused of stealing $6
worth of clothing from Joseph Ruef of
438 Fifth street, whose laundress she
was, denied the theft and insinuated
that she was a victim of persecution
because she had declined to harken to
love overtures from the complainant.
She might have received his tenders of
affection more pleasantly, she added.
If she had not been the fiancee of an
other gentleman whose linen she
washed and Ironed. Mr. Ruef hotly de
nounced the plea as an entire fabrica
tion and requested Judge Fritz to look
at its author and decide if she were the
kind of female that would be likely to
create covetousness in the soul of any
man who was neither blind nor insane.
As the court was too busy Just then to
appraise Miss Sullivan's magnetism
the case was continued and a search
warrant issued for the garments
claimed by Mr. Ruef.

William Davis, a husky young mendi

tron, moved to pity by his tale of dis
tress, took him to a Third street res
taurant and ordered dinner for him,
but after Â«he had retired and ere the

a request that leniency be extended to

"Do you know him?" inquired the
Judge, glancing at Werner.
Indeed, I do," replied the interceder,
following the g'ance and nodding recog

"Well, I'm sorry you did not speak in

By request of Police Captain Duke,
who was stabbed last Sunday morning
by Michael O'Keefe, hfs assailant's ar
raignment was continued by Judge Mo
gÂ£.n till to-morrow, when the wounded
officer will be able to appear in court.
Judge Mogan pronounced Reuben
Stafford (colored) guilty of vagrancy
and ordered him to appear to-day for
sentence, thereby conveying great an
guish to Reuben himself and a number
of Afro-American ladies and gentlemen
who sat among the spectators. For it
had been pleaded in Reuben's behalf
that he was the champion male cake-
walker of the Pacific Coast, having de
feated all competitors for the title and
trophy at "Senator" Hampton's mem
orable tournament In the Mechanics'
Pavilion, and that he was entered to
defend his championship at a contest
which is to take place at Los Angeles
so soon after this date that even a
week's imprisonment would prevent his
participation and thereby deprive the
event of its most magnetic feature.
"Ef dar am no champeen dar de show
won't be wuff nuffin," Mr. Stafford ex
plained, modestly displaying a medal
that could be utilized for a dinner plate.
"En dat ain't de wust ob it," he con
tinued, "fo* ef Ah doan show some ob
dem Jelllx pussons may erlege dat Ah'm

Freedom to go and augment his lau
rels might have been awarded to Mr.
Stafford if he had not been given a
very bad character by the arresting po
liceman, who alleged among other
things that since his acquisition of the
big medal the defendant has had no
visible means of maintenance, although
he has managed to wear fine raiment
and retain his avoirdupois. When a- ked

cert hall, but a tryout of his voice dis
closed both vocal incapacity and tone

PROSECUTION
GETS SETBACK
Principal Witness* Against
Ex - Pugilist Accused of
Manslaughter Is Missing
DISAPPEARS SUDDENLY
Officers Sent in Search of
Him Report to Court That
He Is on Way to the East
Special Dispatch to Tbm CmJL
SAN RAFAEL., Feb. I.â The case of
Francis McGrath, a former pugilist,
charged with manslaughter, came up
for trial to-day In the Superior Court.
On two former occasions the attorney
for the defense challenged the Jury,
first on the ground that the clerk had
not certified to the list of jurors named
by the new Board of Supervisors, and
the second time he objected on the
giound that the Sheriff had not per
sonally summoned the jury; There
were no objections to-day, however,
and a jury was soon impaneled.
The prosecution took the testimony of
the physicians who attended Taylor
after the encounter. They testified that
death was caused by a blow struck
below the belt. When Thomas Court
ney, the principal witness for the pros
ecution was called, he failed to reply.
An investigation showed that Court
ney, who had been In attendance on
the first day of the trial, had since
disappeared. Officers sent in search of
the missing: witness reported to Dis
trict Attorney Boyd that he had fled
East to void testifying. A bench war
rant was issued for Courtney's arrest
and every effort will be made to ap
prehend him if he is still in the State.
The trial will be resumed to-morrow
at 10:30 a. m.
BITS OF PARIS
LIFE ARE SHOWN
IN "LA BOHEME"
If we are accustomed to one opinion
more than another concerning San
Francisco it is that the town is like
Paris. Every one that strolls In here
plays Columbus to the discovery. Per
haps it is because we resemble
Parisians that we are so perennially
fond of "La Boheme." A poor audience
with the opera for bill. l do not remem
ber since the historic first production.
Nor was the record broken last night,
when "Boheme" was sung at the Tivoll
for the first time this season to a great
and noisy crowd.
Trulyâ taking the first, third and
fourth actsâ "La Boheme" is not unlike
a bit of lower Montgomery street done
to music. I have seen Schaunard there
in his scarlet tie; Marcel, pluckily
starving over the masterpiece that was
to make him famous, and a Collinr.
coatless. Rudolfo waits at the restau
rant, however, and perhaps generally
Montgomery street starves less pa
tiently than the Paris Latin quarter.
It takes to other tradesâ as keeping
chickens, as one Marcel I know Is do
ing at the moment. But Montgomery
street rou will always find at "La Bo
heme."\ The rest of us go partly be
cause we know and love Montgomery
street, and again well know and love
the eloquent musical setting Puccini
has put to it. One never wearies of the
opera. It is only good or less good as it
is given.
One has heard better productions, or
productions in better shape than last
night's. It was rarely good in spots
and a good average, but there were
ragged places not a few and the
prompter was requisitioned oftener
than need be. Some one, by the way,
has put down the soft pedal on
the prompter and I know of at least
one grateful observer. How the opera
will go on Saturday and Sunday nights
may be foreseen from the finale of the
third act that was repeated. It was
hardly the same thing on its repetition.
There was the difference between a
dress rehearsal and a public perform
ance. TMs, likely, had to do a good
deal with Dora de Fillippe, who made
her debut as Musetta last evening.
This sprightly little regular of the
Tivoli forces proved anew her useful
ness last night. She was called upon at
quite short notice to take the part and
fits Excellently into it. But Miss de
Fillippe was evidently voice-tired and
not a little nervous. She showed,
however, what she is going to do with
the part in the aforementioned repeti
tion, in which she exhibited all her
usual snap and vim. The house simply
howled for it. Polacco came and bowed
between Musetta and Mlm!, but they
would not stop. At last the conductor
had to come out again and repeat the
scene.
Miml? Mlmi, of course. One is
not forgetting. Berllndl was the Mlml,
and a touchingly sincere figure as the
little grisette. She contrived most
prettily to suggest the gentle vanities
of Mimi, the kindness of the little
creature. One missed Agrostini some
what for the Rudolfo, but you will
find Bazelli quite charming. Mon
tanari one did not miss. Berlindl's
Mlmi is in exactly the same lovable
key, though a portrait much finer In
Us detail, and though more heavily
and brilliantly voiced, Berlindi re
minds here, too. One gets, indeed,
what one would prefer to forget,
much of the Montanarl vibrato. Mr.
Polacco was a little unkind to her on
occasion in hurrying a phrase here
and there, by the way.
Bazelli distinctly pleases as Rudolfo.
His vocal quality is truly pleasing,
and though one doesn't worship the
high C, Bazelli encompased a beauty
hist night â Just as pure tone as his
falsetto in the Salve Dimora was fal
setto.
It is an unavoidable pity that the
Bazelli and Berlindi voices arc not a
good blend, their scenes were so charm
ingly sympathetic otherwise. One
would prefer, by the way, in both the
first and third acts at the close, &
much softer cadence as the lovers
leave.
Slgnor Cirotto, who has done little
this season, furnished a good Coltine,
repeating the "Farewell to the Coat"
song to one's pleasure. Romboll add
ed a capital Marcel to his honorable
record, and Signor Mugnoz was effi
cient as Schaunard. Cervi did the
double roles of the landlord and Al
cindoro usefully. The chorus was ef
fective beyond custom, a charming
children's song was most happily used
from among the usually cuts in the
tavern scene, and Polacco was in ex
cellent form. "La Traviata" to-night.

Croker returned to New York to-day
on the steamship Kaiser Wilhelm der
Grosse, arriving at quarantine at
noon and coming up to the city on thÂ«
tug Robert Palmer. Croker's hair is
snow white, and the shock of his son's
death has left its trace in his drawn
features. There was none of his for
mer buoyant stride in his step, and
when he crossed the deck to greet
friends who welcomed him he displayed
feebleness. When addressed by re
porters he half turned away and said
slowly;
"I have come to bury my son. I don't
know where they are goinK to take me.
I don't even know when the funeral
will be. Please don't talk to me about
politics. There is no politics for me
to discuss at this time. I am .out of
politics forever."
The former Tammany leader evince<
some displeasure when he learned tha
he was to be taken off the \e3sel a
quarantine. Before his friends came v
the Hide and as soon as be learned tn
purpose of the tug's presence he turne
to the room steward, Fritz Rose, wh
has been in constant attendance udo
him during the voyage, and said:
"I wish they hadn't made all this
fuss. I don't like It, and would have
preferred to go in like any ordinary
passenger if my wishes had been cop
suited."
During the eight days of voyage from
Southampton to New York Croker re
mained in absolute seclusion. Ail of
his meals were served in his suite of
three rooms, and he left them scarcely
a half-dozen times. Then he selected
times when the other passengers were

follow until all sections of the city,
where conditions demand, snail have
been covered. These stations will be
open from 7 to 9 each morning, and
every child, scholar or otherwise, will
receive a breakfast for the asking.
Quarters where they may warm them
selves are also provided.
The movement grew out of recent
statements that fully 70,000 children go
to school in this city every morning
practically v ithout food because >f
their parents' poverty. Those connect
ed with organized charities deny the
assertion, and have asked the Boari
of Education to lnvestigata the mat
ter.
Asked, if she did not think the state
ment was an exaggeration, Command
er Booth said:
"I believe that 70.000 is a very low
estimate. The Salvation Army. work-
Ing among the poorer classes, reaches
the truth of such a situation. Our dis
trict workers have proved that thou
sands of children go breakfaatiess to
school.
"I have heard people say that they
thought this plan to feed the children
would encourage pauperism. While
there may be some who will take ad
vantago of the stations, they will be
only a few. The district leaders will
keep a careful watch. "

ROCKEFELLERS RAILROADS.
THE report of the passage of the Yanderbilt roads to the owner
ship of the Rockefeller-Harriman interest is probably true. The
X of the Standard Oil Company was due to its ability to con
trol br â¢ ti'.ri. To do this every possible expedient was used.
The c 11 came in' the building of pipe lines for transportation
of oil. which was a device entirely complementary to the enterprise
which suggested it.
The legai position of the pipe line has not been decided. The
- resisted its classification as a common carrier, while
at the same time appealing to the right of eminent domain to con
demn a right of way. From a legal standpoint we have no doubt
- can be expelled from any private property over which
it has not bought the right to go. But, be that as it may, the rise
Rockefeller is the romance of transportation. He saw clearly,
and sooner than other men saw it, that the control of transportation
is the control of production and consumption, and for the last five
years has been taking in transportation companies wherever their
stock was listed and available. This last deal extends his influence
to ioo.ooo miles of railroad. It puts practically under his control
continuous lines from the Pacific to the Atlantic, from San Fran-
The Yanderbilts did much, as their influence extended westward,
I r<-ak< in the overland trip. Twenty years ago on the
-om Xew York there was a break at Chicago, at Omaha and
: ien. Finally Ogden was cut out and then Omaha through Van
â¢trol of the Chicago and Northwestern, and only the Chi
-eak is Jeft. While it is said that the central operating office of
-tern will 'be in Chicago, the financial interest will be in Xew
York, so that it is reasonable to expect that we will have through
trains that will make the run from San Francisco to New York in
an four days. This prospect is satisfactory to this coast, and
if acceleration of the passenger business be joined to like effect upon
freipl may well be, there will be no complaint on the score;
It is evidence of the great progress made in the evolution of law
pg to- corporations that this vast combination, if made thirty
ears ago. would have been feared as a menace to the country.
at time the people were groping in the dark, and feeling almost
aimlessly for the means to control railroad corporations, and put
them under a more rigid restraint than was afforded by the common
mmon carriers. The first railroad consolidation, that of*
osing the Chicago and Northwestern system, had been
*nade by Samuel J. Tilden in iB6O. Though it joined links into a'â 
fcener 1 that had only a few hundred miles of track, it was re
garded in Illinois and Wisconsin as an appalling calamity, but it
immediately enabled through trains, through tickets and baggage t
checks, to the great convenience of passenger traffic.
The fear in which it was held was the motive for legislative ex- j
r-ntÂ« in railroad control, and soon all the Middle West was the
scene of contention over railroads. The granger laws of Wisconsin,
the legislative freight schedules of lowa and the regulative laws of
is followed. They were all more or less tentative and experi- ,
mental, but they were a beginning.
De then the courts and Congress have gone far beyond any
]K>int that was in sight then. It has been a test of our institutions,
and is still a test. But the capacity to follow up every consolidation
of transportation interests with public regulation and power of con- j
as been found and applied. It is significant that almost concur
with the President's invocation of all the powers of the â 
Federal Government to concrete in a system of public control comes j
'ockefeller combination of 100.000 miles of road in one system, j
orj which to test the regulative authority of the Government. As in j
all past consolidations of lines the evolution of law has corresponded
to the extent of the combinations of track, no one need fear that i
railroad consolidation now will outrace public authority and public
The people will get, relatively, the same expansion of con- i
venience in travel that followed former and smaller consolidations,
and this will not be accompanied by any invasion of their interests
that is beyond legal remedy.
For California the change is more acute than for any other part
of the country. For many years we enjoyed the distinction of hav
ing a transcontinental road, btrilt by Californians and held by them,
operated from San Francisco. The other transcontinental lines
north of us were projected and managed from the East. Ours was a
domestic institution, a member of our family, and though we quar
reled with it, it was a family affair. All this passes away. We are
It the end of a system that has its other termini at many points
on the Atlantic seaboard, its purse in New York, and its operating
center in Chicago. The change is great, but with the flexible power
of the law for our panoply, we need not anticipate injury to our in
terests as its result.
SIGNIFICANT COINCIDENCES.
" I "HREE incidents of moment that have recently developed in the
affairs of the nation unite to form a coincidence of more than
passing significance. On the same day that the United States
preme Court handed down its decision confirming the injunction
by a lower court against the meat packing trust for violation
of the Sherman law, the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce voted a favorable report upon the Esch-Townsend bill,
authorizing the Interstate Commerce Commission to have direct su
pervision over 'the regulation of railroad rates. That day also Presi
dent Roosevelt at the Union League banquet in Philadelphia spoke
unreservedly of his conviction that the time for complete Federal
control over great corporations is fast approaching.
Judge Grosscup, the Circuit Court magistrate, whose decision
against the packing companies was upheld by the Supreme Court,
made the following significant prophecy upon discussing the effect
of the higher tribunal's ruling: "It effectively clears the decks for
what I believe will be the next really great national movement â
as the restriction and final abolition of slavery was the last great
fundamental movement â the organization and supervision by the
nation itself of the great corporations of the future." Almost coin
cident in point of time was the utterance of President Roosevelt,
-angelr confirming the belief expressed by Judge Grosscup. "Un
questionably the great development of industrialism means that
there must be an increase In the supervision exercised by the Gov
ernment over business enterprises." And to this he adds, "No finally
satisfactory result can be expected from merely State action. The
action must come through the Federal Government."
Truly the decision of the Supreme Court and the committee
<^age of the Esch-Townsend bill would seem to be sufficient earn
â¢ of the fulfillment in the near future of the prophecy made by
ip and the policy announced by Roosevelt. In one day per
manent restraint is put upon combination for the restraint of in
terstate commerce and fair promise made of permanent restraint
being placed also upon the abuse of interstate carrying privileges.

BETTY SEERS
ETHEL BARRINGTON
"I must apologize, under the
circumstances."
. .% W # ILL, nothing change you?"
\Y / Bob Deeiing*s voice was
yY/ almost tragic, bat it made
little impression on Betty.
"I've signed a contract," she cried,
waving the document before Ms bewil
dered eyes. "I am to report for re
hearsal next week. I'm an understudy,
that is the technical term. I play when
the leading woman doesn't."
"It seems bo â so indecent, that you
should work when I am simply foolish
with money. Consider what a cad I
must feel, consider* â ''
"Bobby, you are the dearest of
chums, but you are dense at times. A
g^rl could not marry for money."
"It's not unheard of," suggested
Deering.
"I'm thinking of nice girls, myself for
instance."
"I asked you while you had plenty,"
he offered by way of excuse.
"Of course, you did. You always do
the correct thing. But I refused you, so
it would look mercenary to take you
now. Bob, you must understand. It is
a sort of crisis with me. I want to work
to be self-supporting. Father's death â
and our other losses â ought to make a
woman of me. I shall not be less de
sirable then, if some day â "
"I hope the time will come before
work and disappointment eat the sun-
Bhtne out of your heart," and Robert
Deering, multi-millionaire, went home
convinced that at times money Is a
drawback.
When George. Seers, Betty's father,
had died suddenly no one had suspected
that he was financially crippled. But
such had proven the case. His fcidow
had found herself bereft of everything,
but she had cared only as it had af
fected her daughter. They had moved
into a tiny flat and practiced rigid
economy. Mrs. Seers had believed it
only a passing phase for Betty. Deer
ing's devotion was well known, and
she approved of him.
Then suddenly Betty had announced
her determination to Join the army of
independent women and become a
wage-earner. She had kept her plans
to herself, fearing that her efforts
might prove fruitless. As an amateur
actress she had won recognition, so
naturally it was to the stage that she
turned in her need. After anxious days
of uncertainty she obtained the coveted
contract. She was engaged at a small
6alary to understudy a prominent
actress then playing a successful en
gagement in the city.
"Just think, Muzzle, could anything
be easier? Night and matinee I report
one hour before the play, remain a
while and then come home, earning
thereby on Saturdays a fat envelope to
meet the bills."
"You are Buch a feather brain. You
CUPID WINS AT CARDS.
A game of cards and a losing streak
have placed Michael Sheridan and
John Gallagher of McAdoo, Pa., In
the matrimonial market They played
with Condy Priel and Michael Bren
nan, best two out of three, the losers
to make proposals and be married
during the year 1905.
Each team won a game and the
third created more enthusiasm than
a baseball contest, because of the sol
emn stake. The cards were dealt
fairly and with firm hands, the score
being close, but neither side showed
signs of creating a disturbance to end
the game.
With a tie score and one point to
win, the cards were dealt the last time.
As Sheridan and Gallagher looked at
their hands it beat any situation In
poker on record, but the game was
played to the end.
The crowd remained motionless and
as the victors arose a cry was raised
and everybody congratulated the los
ers. They will be true to their prom
ise and start thÂ« new year in search

will tire of work and lose Bob with
your whims."
Betty made a grimace. "Do you think
I could? I'd appreciate him more If I
believed it possible. Bob Is so hope
lesslyâ mine."
The next week Betty's occupation be
gan. In the morning she attended re
hearsal and spent long hours in being
drilled and coached by an irascible
stage manager. In the afternoon she
studied by herself. When sbe had mas
tered the lines perfectly she commenced
reporting at each performance. At first
she felt her importance. But as the
weeks passed into months and the lead
ing woman remained unnaturally
healthy doubts of her own usefulness
discouraged the girl. The only comfort
was the "envelope." She missed her
friends andâ Bob. She had not seen or
heard anything of him in two months.
One afternoon as she brooded over
these things Deering entered as though
there had been no lapse of time.
"Oh, Bob â Bob â " If Deering had
absented himself for a purpose it was
answered in Betty's glad cry. He
looked supremely happy.
"Now you Just must come to dine
with me," he declared. The invitation
vras accepted. Deering, Betty and her
mother were soon seated at a cozy
table in a fashionable hotel.
"How good it tastes," cried Betty.
It's so long since I've really dined."
Her spirits ran riot, her eyas grew
bright as they had not been for days.
Deering beamed with satisfaction.
They talked sense as though it were
nonsense, and nonsense seriously,
both ridiculously happy.
"I've a box for Mrs. Flske. You
will both come?"
"After reporting?" agreed Betty,
remembering duty.
"Report what?
Where 7"
"At the theater. I'm understudy,
you know. But it won't take long. I
go about 7 or half-past."
"Seven or half-past," repeated
Deering. "Well, it's too late now!"
"What will they say â " Betty hesi
tated.
"Nothing; Just tip the doorkeeper
to say you called."
"Doorkeeper â lfs the stage man
ager, and he is a bear."
What harm could It do to miss one
night when she had reported for
three months?
After the theater they went to sup

thing but the passing moment. A
friend stopped to exchange greetings.
"And where have you been to

"Nowhere. Had tickets for the â i
But the leading lady was taken sud
denly ill, and they closed the theater.
Jolly strange they had no under

his friends.
"Oh, oh!" gasped Betty when she
could gÂ«*c her breath. "The under

hysterically. "I â a business woman!
And at the first taste of pleasure I for

"It's my fault!" protested Deering.
contritely.
"The manager wont recognise your
responsibility â and he never gave you
an envelope â "
"A what?"
"They'll discharge me! What shall
I do?" There were tears in Betty's
eyes.
"Enter into another engagement."
suggested Deering promptly. "One
where you can't get your notice,
where you won't be understudy, but
the real thing."
The next day the manager sat at his
desk when the office boy brought him
a card. "Send her away, I'm busy,"
commanded the manager, angrily.
"But it's most important," pleaded
Betty, slipping past the boy. "I
don't suppose you will forgive m* â "
"It was so unprofessional that I

"Mrs. Deering," interpolated Betty.
"Mrs. Robert Deering." The name
was well known. The manager turned
to listen.

"I wish you every happiness," said
the manager, gallantly.

DEPEW'S ORIGINAL
FOUND IN A VERY
ANCIENT STATUE
WORLD'S OU>EST STATUE.
A REMARKABLE resemblance to
Senator Chauncey M. Depew ap
pears in a statue unearthed by
the expedition of the general
exploration fund of the University
of Chicago, now at Bagdad. The statue
is believed to be the oldest in the
world.
Dr. E3. J. Banks, field director of the
expedition, has sent to the university
a detailed report of the find and his
estimate that the statue has been
covered up for thousands of years.
Hieroglyphic Inscriptions on the arm
of the figure denote that It is the ef
figy of King Da-Udu, who, the report
adds, may have been David, a King of
Ud-nun, the ancient name of the
Babylonian city of Bismya, where the
statue was discovered.
Of white marble, the statue was
fotind in fragments several feet apart
and secretly conveyed at night to the
house of the explorers because of the
superstition of the native diggers. Its
antiquity exceeds, the director says,
that of any other known King of Baby
lonia, and when the expedition returns
to the United States the marble statue
will be Its chief treasure.
Not only in the form of the chiseled
face does the resemblance to the Sena
tor from New York find expression.
The curved lines of risibility that
marked the living king as a fit com
panion in laughter to Mr. Depew at
once attracted the attention of the ex
plorers and were the subject of special
mention.
"From beneath the thick coating of
dirt," the explorers' account says, "the
marble face seemed to light up with a
wonderful smile of gratification, for
the long sleep of thousands of years
was at an end and the long lost head
restored; or, perhaps, the smile was
the reflection of our own feelings."
From the description that accom
panies the account that has to do with
the form of the whole statue it is
brought out that King Da-Udu was in
clined to physical stoutness, had lit
tle hair and an extremely high fore
head, and in height was also quite the
counterpart of the wit of thousands of
years later.
Senator Depew could hardly fail to
b*Â» pleased with this description of the
Babylonian raconteur â if he was one â
whose smile comes down to the mod
ern world through the sands of cen
turies.
"The back and shoulders are grace
fully formed," says the description;
"the arms at the elbows are free from
the body and the hands are clasped at
the waist."
The smile, the clasped hands of evi
dent self-satisfaction bring readily to
â mind the picture of a good Joke Just
told and of the Joker awaiting the ap
propriate applause and laughter.

Drama Between Millstones.
The drama in England to-day, said
Henry Arthur Jones at a recent dinner,
is crushed between the upper millstone
of fine art and the nether millstone of
popular amusement. The remedies are
the recognition of the dramatist aa a
literary artist and the means of giving
the young actor the training which
long runs deny him. Mr. Jones de
scribed nine-tenths of the entertain
ments at fashionable theaters as rank
tomfoolery.

DECEIVING THE HENS.
Effing-ham L. Taliman of Blauvelt.
Kockland County, claijns to have
trained a hen to lay three eggs in on*
day. The shells are not well formed, as
the lime secretion does not keep pace
with the yolk and albumen formation,
but he hopes to remedy this by a larger
mixture of powdered oyster shells wlUi
the mash.
The scarcity and the high prica ot
eggs have led chicken farmers to try all
kinds of devices to make willing hens
do double duty. On* of the commonest
of these devices is the use of trap nests,
instead of the ordinary open nests theaÂ«
inventions have trap doors, which close
when the hen enters. After the hen has
laid an egg she Is allowed to come out,
but inatead 0/ permitting the ben free
dom and rest until the next day some
avaricious hen farmers let her out at
the rear of the nest instead of the front
and th* hen. Instead of being free, finds
herself In another trap nest. Having
learned by experience that tha prÂ»~a of
liberty is an egg and believing that sne
must bÂ« mistaken in thinking aha) has
Just laid, there is nothing for the poor
hento do but lay again.
; Such duplicity ultimately destroys the
hen's faith in mankind, and aha either
ceases to lay. or becomes a pessimist

unprofitable. â New.Tork World.

BUDD SCORES
GRAND JURORS
Brands Kidnaping of Chan
Cheung as One pi Worst
Outrages Ever Perpetrated
DOMMITTEES NOT LEGAL
A liniment on Motion to Set
Aside Indictment Conclud
ed and Judgment Keserved
The argument on the motion to set
aside and vacate the Indictment of the
Grand Jury charging Chan Cheung
vith the murder of Tom Yick of the
Chinese Educational Society was con
cluded before Judge Lawlor yesterday.
The Judge continued the case till to
morrow, but it Is understood he will
not render his decision till some day
next week to give him time to examine
the authorities submitted.
Attorney James H. Budd, who spoke
for the greater part of the day, went
fully into the laws and decisions gov
erning the duties of the Grand Jury.
He contended that the appointment of
committees by the Grand Jury was
illegal; that they weTe presumed to
meet as a body in secret session and
receive their communications through
the District Attorney alone. They had
no right to appoint two or three of
their number to go around the city on
fishing excursions" and making dis
closures for the benefit of the public.
He also contended that the actions
of Foreman Andrews in kidnaping
Chan Cheung, through Juror Bowes,
his appointee, and endeavoring to
force from him a confession as to
boodling In Chinatown disqualified An
drews from being present when the in
dictment against Chan Cheung was
found. It was one of the worst out
rages ever perpetrated in this city and
If allowed to pass unpunished where,
he asked, was the protection to any
citizen ? If Chan Cheung had not been
a strong man, mentally and physically,
unlike many of his countrymen, he
might have blamed an innocent man
for the Chinatown boodling so as to
stop the grilling to which he was sub
jected. He charged Andrews with be
ing: guilty of trickery and contended
that in all the circumstances the in
dictment should be vacated.
Judge Lawlor seemed to have been
impressed with Budd's argumerfts and
remarked that the present Grand Jury
had been appointed before he was
Presiding Judge. He would look into
the practice of grand juries so as to
to be in a position to instruct them
properly.

trip to Del Monte. She flew into a
rage because he gave his seat besida
her in the car to another lady. Ten
days later she told him he -was craay,
and became angry because he would
not break a business engagement to
go to Dal Monte. In Techau's Tav
ern she called him a brute, and in
January of last year she dismantled
their rooms in the Hotel Metropole,
Oakland, and forbade his using them
during her absence in the East. She
was gone nearly a year and wrote to
him that she did not intend to live
with him again.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1905.
LANDS BOUGHT
BY TRUSTEES
Full Right of Way Around
End of the Bay Acquired
by Spring Valley Company
SCHUSSLER SPEAKS OUT
Attorney Kellogg Promises
to Turn In a List of the
Parcels Secured by Client
Much Information was extracted
yesterday by Assistant City and Coun
ty Attorney John C. Partridge out of
Herman Schussler, chief engineer of
the Spring Valley Water Works, rela
tive to the company's ownership of all
the valuable watershed and water
rights around the bay.
At the outset of the cross-examina
tion M. B. Kellogg, counsel for the
water company, announced that he
would turn into court a list of the
lands acquired by the company
through trustees and of the- prices
paid for them. Mr. Schussler ex
plained that there were large tracts in
Alameda and Santa Clara, including
reservoir sites and 17,000 acres on
CoyotÂ« Creek, belonging to the com
pany.
"We have put into the hands of
trustees," said Mr. Schussler, "almost
the complete right of way around the
end of the bay."
That included, continued tha wit
ness, several miles of land from which
the company could develop a large
quantity of water in the shape of
wells, and it was from these lands
purchased primarily for rights of way
around th e head of the bay from Coy
ote Creek that the next additional
supply of water would be developed.
This method of acquiring property by
putting it into the hands of trustees
was adopted because the company
found that if people knew that Spring
Valley was buying them they would
raise the prices of such lands to an
exorbitant figure. Where it was nec
essary to purchase a certain group of
properties every piece in that group
was bought in the names of trustees
and turned over to the company when
the purchase of the whole group had
been completed.
In regard to Lake Merced the wit
ness stated that the surface waters
from surrounding vegetable gardens
had drained into it until the company
built a protective system around it
extending to hardpan. After a lengthy
cross-examination by Mr. Partridge
the witness admitted that the main
reason for acquiring the lands sur
rounding Lake Merced was that he
expected to use them for a great cen
tral system in the future. Also that
the forty-two acres which the com
pany has acquired back of the House
of Correction had been obtained for
the purpose of erecting a great dis
tributing reservoir and pumping sta
tion in the near future. He said also
that this distributing reservoir would
be used in connection with the new
fifty-four inch Alameda pipe line and i
the increased height of the dam at j
Crystal Springs.
Mr. Schussler will resume at 10
a. m. to-day.
BLAMES MAYOR FOR
CRIPPLING DEPARTMENT
Recorder Godchaux Complains Bitterly
of His Honor's Refusal to Ap
prove Appropriation.
Recorder Godchaux yesterday filed
his annual report, showing the receipts
of the office during 1904 to have been
$61,309 05 and the expenses $42,-
254 88, leaving a surplus of $18,054 17.
There were 39,396 documents filed.
Godchaux takes Mayor Schmitz to task
for refusing to approve of an appro
priation of $5000 for extra clerks,
thereby crippling the efficiency of his
department. Godchaux says the Mayor
is the only one who can relieve a sit
uation, very distressing to the Re
corder if not disastrous to the public. !
He says that the book typewriting ma- j
chines are becoming unfit for use ow
ing to the lack of a skilled machinist J
to care for them and it will soon be ,
impossible to transcribe the records.
The receipts of the office for last
month were $5330 15, a gain of $405 75
over January, 1904. There were 3484
jpapers filed, of which 960 were deeds
|* and 573 mortgages.

mistook it for champagne. She told her
husband on his return that he had been
presented with a case of wine. He be
ing a genial fellow went to the telephone
and called a few friends.
In the evening when they came to
open the wine the mistake was of course
discovered. A prominent physician who
was among the guests broke into a cry of
del.ght. "Why," he said, "this is provi
dential. This beats champagne all to
pieces. There is nothing that acts so
gently on thÂ« liver, tones the stomach
and gives a man such a feeling of health
as Red Raven. It is justly called the
Prince of Aperients, and taken in the
morning after a dinner or banquet will
surely cleanse the system and put one
right for the day's work." He pulled the
cork and poured the sparkling water Into
a glass. "I do not think champagne
oould bÂ« more beautiful," he added. 7 'or
half as efficacious.". They all agreed, and
each man took home a dainty bottle as a
souvenir. â¢

ANOTHER HINT
IS UNEXPLAINED
Executor White Does Not
Divulge Interesting Con
versation With Clunie
DEEDS AGAIN AN ISSUE
Witness Positive That Wife
Did Not Know Contents of
Papers Which She Signed
The interposition of an objection by
Attorney Walter Robinson yesterday
prevented Burrell G. White from giv
ing the details of another interesting
story hinted at In his testimony. An
drew J. Clunie wbb examining the ex
ecutor upon the matter of the doubt
ful validity of the deeds signed by
Mrs. Clunie transferring valuable
property to her husband at the time
of their agreement to separate. White
said he had been discussing with Gen
eral Clunie the making of the latter's
will. The general had expressed the
desire for his wife to have the Turk
land property in Sacramento, one of
his reasons being that "When I dla
Andy is liable to do anything."
"Now tell it," shouted Clunie. "What
was I liable to do, since in his will the
general named me as a trust**, exec
utor and residuary legatee."
"Oh, he had his reasons for bo ap
pointing you." said White: but all ef
forts of Clunie to get the reasons wera
in vain. Judge Coffey sustained an
objection to the questions upon the
ground that the matter was privileged,
White claiming to have been General
Clunie's attorney.
Andrew Clunie offered to the court
to prove that White was not the at
torney, but a "'go-between to smug
gle letters to the general in his house."
The court ordered the statement
stricken out and said he did not want
the witness subjected to these reflec
tions.
Clunle continued hia examination
upon the question of the deeds and won
from White the statement that It waa
his "positive belief that Mrs. Clunl*
did not sign those papers."
Just before adjournment Clunie
went into the subject of a silvÂ«r tea
set given to White by Ralph Wilson
and Judge Slack, Mrs. Clunie's attor
neys, after the executors had compro
mised the claim for the community
property by a payment of JIhO.OOO.
White said it was merely a token of
esteem and he refused to state the
value of the set.
Clunie declared that It was not a
"token" and he intended to connect
the gift with his charge that White
recommended Wilson to Mrs. Clunie
as her attorney In the contest. The
hearing will be resumed on Monday.
WHOLiE STATE RECEIVES
A GENEROUS DOWNPOUR
Northern River* Are Rising Rapidly
and Weather Bureau Experts
Think Overflow Probable.
Rain fell generally in California
yesterday from Los Angeles to the
Oregon line. The precipitation in
the Sacramento River Valley was par
ticularly heavy, averaging more than
an inch in depth. At San Luis Oblspo
more than two Inches of rain fell
within twelve hours. The Bear,
Feather, American, Tuolumne and
Cosumnes rivers were rising rapidly
last night, and an overflow is prob
able in the Sacramento Valley.
The Weather Bureau sent warnings
yesterday to. ail stations north of
Knights Landing. Snow fell in the
mountain region. Outside the heads
a strong wind was blowing last night,
but from general Indications the
forecasters thought there would be

Grand Trunk Pacific Engineers Re-

VANCOUVER, B. a, Feb. Lâ Fir*
new passes through tha Rocky Moun

Grand Trunk Pacific engineers, who
have Just returned to Vancouver from

RESORT CASES
ARE SUBMITTED
Byington Argues Right of
Police to Enter Immoral
Houses Without Warrants
HE CHAEGES FRAUD
Says Affidavit in Belden
Place Suit Is an Impo
sition Upon the Court
Th* Jackson-street and Belden
place injunction matters. Involving the
right of the police to raid Immoral re
sorts without warrant for arrest, have
been submitted to Judge Hebbard for
decision. District Attorney Byington
and Assistant District Attorney Harris
made reply yesterday morning to the
arguments of Henry Ach. who rep
resented Sebastian Ravani, keeper of
the cigar store at 620 Jackson street.
Byington declared that the cigar store
was a sham and used for a fraud upon
the court in order to grain' judicial pro
tection -for the notorious open cribs.
Byington also Questioned the good
faith of Ach in appearing for the lit
tle cigar store, intimating that he wa*
employed In behalf of the resort.
There wa* no law, he said, to protect
immoral houses, and a court ef equity
could not restrain the polios from
making arrests or entering & place
wherein they believed a crime was be
ing committed.
After the Jackson-street oases wens
submitted the Belden-placÂ« case was
called, and Attorney Nagle, for the
plaintiffs, offered a bunch of affidavits
of men who declared that the "lodg
ing-house business on Belden plaoe
was conducted in a quiet and orderly
manner." There were seven affidavits
of the women proprietors of the
houses, who pleaded that they have
lodging-house licenses and rent lodg
ings to persons of both sexes. Nagle
was ready to submit his case on the
authorities quoted by Ach, but the Dis
trict Attornejr had a sensation In re
serve. He charged that the affidavit
upon which the temporary injunction
against the police was granted was
fraudulent. It had been sworn to by
Pearl An dree, and Byington read her
testimony given before the Grand
Jury, in which she said that she had
never seen the District Attorney, fore
man of the Grand Jury and others,
whom her affidavit charged with par
ticipating In the raids. She did not
even know the attorney who drew
her affidavit; "the other girls wanted
an attorney and she told them to get
the same one for her." Byington de
clared that the affidavit was an impo
sition upon the court. Judge Heb
bard severely asked Nagle what he
had to say, and the latter "expressed
surprise that Byington should spring
such a point without having fortified
it with affidavits. The court said it
was a serious charge and he thought
It should be set forth in affidavits and
given a speedy hearing, but Byington,
after expressing the belief that Na
gle knew the instrument to be false,
decided not to press the point and to
submit the case upon its merits.

WAS ECCENTRIC
Says the Aged Pioneer Once
Made a Threat That He
Would "Smash" a Pugilist
TELLS OF HIS APPETITE
Waiter Testifies Against
Asked for Pie, Although
It Disagreed With Him
A fondneM for p<% & rabid dislike tor
baseball umpires and an ambition to
"smash" Bob Fltzslmmonsâ these are a
few of the eccentricities of th* late
Alexander Toell, according to witnesses
who testified in Judge Kerrigan's court
yesterday.
It was at Bkaggs Spring* three years '
ago that Toell threatened to smite the
freckled champion, declared Policeman
G. J. Ca*h*L The Santa Clara pioneer
objected to bathing- m a tub used bj
the pugilist. Th* remark* reached Fits
eimmons' ears. H* went up to Toell '
and said, 'If you ware not so little I
would break *r*ry bon* hi your body.'*
"If you try it I will smash yÂ«u up," ,
Toell retorted quickly.
Nels Jessen, who occupies a building
owned by Toell, gave testimony intend
ed to show that the capitalist was *r- ,
ratio. "One time," said the witness,
"Toell told me to give some men who
were working on the building all the
drinks they wanted. At the end of the
week he came to pay for them. I told
him that th* men had two glasses of :
whisky a day. H* burst Into tears and
said that it was outrageous for them
to drink whisky. He got angry when 1 1
told him that he had not limited them
to beer."
"Though ToÂ«ll . was a gufftrw from
dyspepsia," declared J. Q. Brown, a
waiter at til* ' Pleasanton Hotel, '"ha
demanded larre slices of plÂ«. Pastry
disagreed with him, but thÂ» old man be
came furious when â  advised not to eat
tt. M
The deposition of W, D. Hobson of
San Joee told of Yoell'B eccentric con
duct at the baseball grames. From this
It was rathered that tha old man was
a rabid fan. The deposition declares
that Toell abused the umpire "some
thing awful" and always left the games
before they were finished.
O. D. Baldwin was put on the stand
to give his opinion as to the value of
the estate. His estimate places the
value of the Ban Francisco property at
about $137,600.

BURNS HANDICAP HORSES ARE SEEN IN A SHARP COMPETITION AT THE RACE TRACK ACROSS THE BAY AND FINISH BEHIND SAIS
PITTSBURG PHIL,
NOTED PLUNGER,
PASSES AWAY
GEORGE E. SMITH <PITTSBURO
PHIL). NOTKIi PLI'XGER. WHO
DIED IX KOHTH CAROLINA.
, ASHEVTLLE, N. C. Feb. George
E. Smith, known wherever race horses
are saddled as "Pittsburg â¢ Phil," the
turf plunger, died here to-day at a san
itarium. Smith had suffered a physical
breakdown and came here, to recu- j
perate. His illness took a sudden turn â¢
for the worse and his death was ex
pected at the sanitarium.
"Pittsburg Phil's" life on the race
track was one of the most remarkable
in turf history; especially from a finan
cial point of view. He has been twenty
four years at the came as owner and
plunger. The amount of money that
has passed through his hands during
that time is almost appalling. A fair
estimate of* his betting transactions
can be gleaned from his investments of
line year alone, which amounted to 1
more than $2,000,000.
Rising frcm a poor cork cutter in a
Pittsburgh glass factory, he became one
of the most conspicuous factors on the
American turf. . He bet huge sums.
Sometimes he lost; most of the time he
wen. Thus he built up a fortune so
large that he was able to retire from
the turf a course of years ago. He
etild his string of horses, but retained
his interest in racetrack?.
Smith came by his title in Chicago.
His own explanation of how he won the
sobriquet is interesting. When buying
auction pools in Chicago he yelled up
to the box. "Phil." As there was an
other "Phil" patronizing the room the
players called Smith "Pittsburg Phil"
as a means of identity. This designa
tion clung to him through his turf ca
reer.
He was born in the Smoky City of
Irish parentage forty-two years ago.
After working in the bottle factory and
attending night school at the same
time, where he acquired an expert

ABVERTISEaiEXTS.
When a child I had a. very severe at-
Itack of Diphtheria, which came near prov-
ing fatal. Upon recovery the glandsof the
neck -were very much enlarged, and after
the free use of iodine, the right one was
reduced to its normal size, but the left
one continued, to grow â very slowly at
first, -until it was about the size of a goose
egg,- which began to press on the wind-
pipe, causing difficult breathing, and be-
came very painful. An incision was made
and a large quantity of pus discharged.
The* gland was removed, or as much as
could with safety be taken out. For ten
years I wore a little piece of doth about an
inch long in my neck to keep the place
open. During this time I had to have it
cut open by the doctor every time I took
cold or the opening clogged. In the Spring
. or early Summer of 1884 I was persuaded
by my wife to use S. S. S., which I did,
6trictly in accordance with directions. I
took twenty-six large bottles, and was en-
tirely cured, for I have not suffered since
that time. Ijv B.S.RaGIAND. -

Kansas Plans to Run State Refinery
With the Use of Convict
Labor.
TOPEKA, Kans., Feb. 1. â A bill will
be recommended for passage in both
houses of the Kansas Legislature to
morrow providing for an appropria
tion of $400,000 to build a new peni
ttntiary at Peru, Kans. The Senate
c ommittee considered it to-night. This
ie to provide men to work the State oil
refinery, which will be establlshd there
under the provisions of the bill. Ac
cording to the Kansas constitution the
i^tnte cannot use free labor in the State
refinery, and, as the present peni
tentiary is so far from the oil fields,
it is necessary that another be estab
lished.
The bill is the outcome of the fight
being waged against the Standard Oil
Company by the Kansas oil interests.
In addition to a State refinery it pro
vides that pipe lines shall be common
carriers and fixes a maximum freight
rate to be charged for transporting oil.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 2, 1905.
BOXERS SEEM
HARD TO SIGN
Promoters Find Difficulty
in Matching Battling Nel
son and Young Corbett
SMALL MEN DRAW WELL
Nearly Five Thousand Spec
tators See Engagement
Between Neil and Hyland
With the Neil-Hyland light out of
the way the promoters are once more
facing a famine in boxers. The most
reasonable match for this month is
that between Young Corbett and Nel
son, but it seems difficult to secure
this. The Dane has contracted the
financial habit from Britt and thinks
he is entitled to a bonus in addition to
his share of the purse. Britt's rep
resentative is also flirting with him
and has led him to believe there is a
possibility of a match in March. This
latter hinges on the passage of a bill
at Sacramento prohibiting boxing.
Tliere would be time ito bring oft a
bout before the bill would become a
law. Britt still wants to fight Jabez
White, the Englishman, who has done
no ring work for three years. He
could not fight before April and if a
bill is passed at Sacramento this would
be too late a date. Young Corbett is
spoiling for a fight and will take on
either Nelson or Britt at short notice.
If the applause which greets the New
Yorker when ever he is presented to a
fight crowd is any criterion he is by
tar the most popular boxer on the
ccast.
Nell and Hyland were the recipients
of much praise yesterday for their
great showing on Tuesday night. They
drew the largest attendance ever seen
here at a bantam weight flsrht. 4381
tickets being taken at the door. The
prices were small, when compared
with those charged at other fights, but
the actual attendance was nearly as
great.
Nell and Harry Forbes drew one of
the largest houses seen at Chicago in
years, and the receipts were only $3100.
At Philadelphia Neil and Hughev Mc-
Govern drew but $2200.
The superstitions of fighters were
brought out strongly before Tuesday
night's fight when a messenger was
seen bearing a stand of flowers toward
Neil's corner. He was driven away
from there and made his way toward
Hyland's corner. Consternation pre
vailed for a time, but the bearer of
the "floral tribute" was finally sup
pressed. Next to flowers the boxers
think the worst "Jinks" lurks in horse
shoes which are sent them. If one is
found on the road it is supposed to
bring luck, but the presentation af
fairs, either plated or in the rouch.
would bring defeat even to Jeffries, ac
cording to the boxers. ,
Hyland was confined to his home yes
terday with a *>adly blistered foot,
which would not yield readily to treat
ment. The foundation for the trouble
was laid on Sunday in a trip on the
road.
Persons who were in a position to
see say Hyland seemed to make a mis
step in the fifteenth round in backine
away from Nell. This threw him
slightly off his balance and for an in
stant his guard was lowered sliehtlv
and his chin was exposed. Neil either
saw the opening or else was trying one
of his numerous lefts for the head.
This one connected and the fight was
won.
it is possible Hyland was tlrlnsr
slightly and was getting slower on his
feet. This lack of footwork Is his ereat
defect as a fighter, especially as he Is
unable to hit effectively unless he is
standing still.
WIFE LAUGHS
AT HIS THREAT
Joseph Moscrop Kills Him
self While Woman Little
Suspects Grewsome Deed
A threat to take his life was repeated
once too often by Joseph Moscrop. and
as a result his bruised and battered
body now lies at the Morprue. After
repeatedly feigning to take his life, his
last threat was laughed at by his wife.
Maria, and later strangers discovered
his body on the pavement beneath a
third-story window from which he hmd
leaped.
Moscrop was a coffee taster by pro
fession and resided with his wife at
876 McAllister etreet. He had been de
layed downtown yesterday evening and
on returning home late was received
by his wife with a sharp scolding.
This he resented and told her that if
she continued such treatment he would
jump out of the window.
To add force to his threat he climbed
over the window-ledge and stood out
side on a small coping that runs to a
nearby balcony. This action did not
alarm the wife, as Moscrop had fre
quently been in the habit of doing this
when feigning to leap from the window
for the amusement or correction of his
children.
The wife waited at the window for
a few seconds for her huÃband to re
appear. Although he was gone longer
than usual the woman did not fear a
tragedy, and, finally becoming im
patient, laughed ironically and left the
room.
A ,few minutes later she was sum
moned to the door by a hurried ring
ins of the doorbell, and admitted
neighbors, who breathlessly informed
her that Moscrop had fulfilled his
threat and leaped to his death.
On the stone pavement thirty feet
below lay Moscrop's body, with broken
neck and shattered limbs. He had
been instantly killed. Mrs. Moscrop
became hysterical.

SAIS IS FIRST FOR ANOTHER HANDICAP
Downs ptary Man
and Bombardier
Quite Cleverly.
Prince Brutus Loses
to Tramotor in a
Hard Drive.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
If the rainy weather holds out Sais,
a recent importation fiom Los Angeles
via New York, is liable to break up
racing across the bay. On Tuesday the
St. Blaise horse took a six furlong
handicap and yesterday he pulled down
the fIOOO event over one mile and fifty
yards for Mrs. James Blute. Not only
that, but two promising Burns handi
cap candidates, Military Man and
Bombardier, besides four lesser lights,
finished behind him.
Carrying 107 pounds, Sais closed fa
vorite and passed Bombardier on the
stretch turn. At the wire "Big Bill"
Knapp did not shake him up much to
dispose of the late Military Man by a
length. Bombardier ran into the show.
Rain fell throughout the racing and
the track was a sea of mud. As usual
two public choices earned brackets.
GREENOCK A WINNER.
It's the same old story over again.
Greenocfc took the opening event at
odds of 12 to 1, running practically un
backed. On two or three occasions
within the past ten days the old horse
had been a good thing and failed to
come through. Foxy Grandpa, the fa
vorite, finished second, a neck before
Dotterel.
Dell Fountain's Modicum made a
gallop of the mile and a quarter selling
affair. The ring laid 6 to 5 about the
old cripple and his price should have
been 1 to 3. Erne stumbled shortly be
fore reaching the wire and Minder
astride Glenarvon snatched the place
by a nose. Formero could not untrack
himself.
Fresh from the land of oransres and
real estate agents, Jimmy Coffey's mare
Cloche dOr, a 12 to 1 shot, scored a
hollow victory in the third number.
Cincinnatus had the call at 6 to o and
McÃride never did have much success
with one of this sort. Yellowstone led
into the stretch, and was then beaten
with ease by the Coffey entry, well
ridden by Tommy Clark. The favorite
ran third.
FORT WAYNE IS UNPLACED.
There always was a big yellow streak
in the composition of Fort Wayne and
it could be discerned yesterday without
the aid of a field glass. The faint
hearted sprinter went to the Dost fa
vorite for the Futurity course run. fifth
to be decided, and ran unplaced. HiD
ponax, ridden by Alarie and 7 to 1.
assumed the lead before reaching the
stretch and in a driving finish downed
Dr. Sherman a neck. The show went
to Effervescence.
Jakie Jones did not distinguish him
self by the handling of Prince Brutus,
favorite for the concluding scramble at
five furlongs. The Prince was installed
favorite in the betting, and should have
won. Jakie, however, picked the poor
est going for his mount, and McÃride.
on Tramotor. led him out less than a
length. Salable finished third.
TRACK NOTES.
The oftener Glenarvon and Lang
ford James meet the more difficult of
solution does the problem become:
"How did the latter happen to beat
Glenarvon on January 19?"
When a horse is sent to the post in
the condition shown by Formero his
entry in future should be refused.
As a money rider, McÃride 'is an
other Cochran. But on many of the
horses the public play he meets with
poor success.
Jockey Harry Blrkenruth dropped
in from Hot Springs yesterday.
The National News Company, which
supplies racing results, will shortly
be superseded by the Western Union
Telegraph Company. Employes of
the latter company were engaged in
putting in wires yesterday.
L. O. Appleby, E. J. Callahan and
Fred Brower, three well known New
York turfmen, were visitors at the
track.
From the present outlook there will
be at least a dozen starters in the
Burns handicap on Saturday.
M. J. Daly purchased the three
year-old Lindsay Gordon from W. B.
Jennings yesterday.
PLAN TO MAKE TACOMA
CAPITAL OF WASHINGTON
Measures in the Legislature Which
Call for the Change From
Olympla.
TACOMA, Feb. I.â The recent burn
ing of the Olympia Hotel has empha
sized the inadequacy of Olympia's facil
ities for caring for large gatherings,
with the result that an organized effort
is on foot to make Tacoma the capital.
Up to this time the movement has been
advocated by legislators and business
men from other localities than Tacoma.
The originator of the present movement
is Senator Baker of Klickitat, one of
the -leading factors in the Senatorial
light which ended last week in the elec
tion of Senator Piles of Seattle. Bills
drawn by Senator Baker were intro
duced to-day in the Senate and House
providing for the changing of the capi
tal from Olympia to Tacoma.
This afternoon President John
Schram of the Seattle Chamber of
Commerce introduced a resolution in
that body providing for an effort by
that chamber to secure the removal to
Tacoma.
Bills introduced at Olympia call for
the submission of the question to a
vote at the general election in Novem
ber of next year. The change can be
made by a two-thirds vote of the Leg
islature followed by a two-thirds vote
of the people.
Tacoma wjll offer a commanding
site in Wright Park in the most aris
tocratic portion of the city. The
changing of the capital, if carried out,
will be followed by the erection of a
capitol building costing at â¢ least
$1,000,000.
Roach to Pitch for Seattle.
CHICAGO, Feb. I.â "Skel" Roach oÂ£
Chicago, whose case as decided by the
National Commission strained relations
between the major and minor leagues,
has signed to pitch next season for the
Seattle club.
Look over yourself and see wherÂ«

PRESIDENT WHEELER TALKS
ON COLLEGE ATHLETICS
Deprecates the Tendency to Leave a
Place Only for the Man
of Strength.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 1.
President Benjamin Ide "Wheeler of the
University of California spoke before
the students of the university to-day.
Dr. Wheeler spoke at length on the
tendency in modern college athletics
to leave a place only for the man of
strength. He said in part:
College athletics have purlHed and vlrillied
the youth of the land and brought health and
confidence of strength to many, but its pur
pose Is served In proportion to the number par
ticipating. There Is no mystical communica
tion of the blessing to those who only sit on
the bleachers. Rather Is it to be feared that
when the few toll and the many sit monsters
of professionalism and not healthy men shall
be the output of our athletic fields and a mon
strous cult of athleticism grow up to oppress
us. This calling for modern Samsons that
they make sport for us is poor use to make
of a college man. I want to see our football
teams changed from the battering rams which
they now arc to teams that will play an open
and a less brutal game. If Walter Camp's
suggestion is taken up a slight step will have
been made In the right direction.
Chess Champions at Play.
PARIS, Feb. 1. â The fourth game
between Frank J. Marshall of Brook
lyn and Ly Janowsky of this city in
the- international chess match resulted
in a draw. The present status of the

being counted.

>Vonnor Tells Collector
a Fairy Story Concerning
a Mythical Sick Sister
ALCOHOLIC DREAMS END
Moran Goes and Sins Also,
but Invents No Story and
Loses Only Twenty Dollars
R- R- O'Connor, an assistant weigh
er iiÂ» the Custom-house, was on the
carpet yesterday forenoon before
United. States Customs Collector Strat- !
ion and was Informed, greatly to his
surprise and. mortification, that he
might go into retreat for ten days.
â with proper deductions of salary for
a serious breach of duty.
It appears that ICr. O'Connor had
meandered sinuously Into the pleasant
vajes of alcoholic aberration and there
remained blissfully dreaming of the
better life. When he awoke with
throbbing- brow and a poor appetite
for solid food, he explained to the
Collector that his sister had been se
riously 111 in Stockton and that being
hastily - summoned thither he had
Jumped aboard a departing train, not
having had time to notify the author
ities of his whereabouts. Upon inves
tigation the Collector ascertained that
this story was pure fiction and that
although It evidenced the possession
of a brilliant imagination on the part
of VTeJyher O'Connor, it did not Jus
tify his absence from duty.
The weigher ha* ten days In which
to repent and a *40 deficiency in his
salary to make up by the exercise of
etriel. economy and abstinence.
Another assistant weigher, M. J.
Mcraa, went on an excursion into
the eiysian fields and pleaded guilty.
Because of the truthfulness of his plea
tie was allowed a five days' vacation
and a deduction of $20 in his salary-

THIRD-STREET BRIDGE j
Santa Fe Stops Operations Because
dry Will Not Improve Approach
to tbe Abutments.
The neglect of the Board of Super
visors to . make an appropriation, in '
the. municipal budget to improve the
approaches 'to the bridge across
Channel street, at the foot of Third,
â¢will" delay the building of the struc
ture for an indefinite period. En
gineer Nicholson of the Santa Fe Rail
way system, which is constructing the
bridge in conjunction with the South
ern Pacific Company, notified City
Engineer Woodward yesterday that
he had received orders from his su
periors not to proceed " with the build- !
ing of the bridge until the city has !
improved the street leading to the
abutments.
The material for the superstructure
la now on the way from the . East i
and will arrive here in a few days, but !
uothing will be done in that connec- 'j
.lion â¢mtil the city takes action. The]
alratment^ on the' Third-street side
have' been completed, and those- on .
the north side will be in place in. a
few weeks. City Engineer Woodward .
laFU June* recommended -that {11,009 t
be set aside to pave {he roadway
leading to the bridge and $3000 to '
install fenders for the protection of
the abutments. No appropriation
Mas made, however, owing to a dif
ference of opinion as to whether the

AUBURY PLANS
TO STOP FAKES
Has Simple Device Against
Marketing of Shares in
Mines That Are Erauds
FINDS A LEGAL JOKER
Mischievous Proviso Upon
Statute Books Shields
Many Shady Stock Deals
Fake mining companies in California,
those that are organised principally for
the purpose of selling stock and rob
bing the public on the basis of false
representations, will get a decided set
back if State Mineralogist Aubury can
force the needed legislation. Within the
past ten rears persons have made San
Francisco their headquarters and have
been sending out fraudulent literature.
They have heaped a rich harvest from
people in the East who have believed
their extravagant statements and
promises. Aubury says that the rem
edy for this condition, which threatens
to interfere with mining investments in
California that are legitimate, lies with
the Legislature,
In fact, says Aubury. the law now on
the statute books is good enough if one
proviso is stricken out. As long ago as
1887 the California Legislature passed a
law, that was sanctioned by the Gov
1 ernor, in which superintendents, direct
ors, managers, agents and other offi
cers of corporations formed or existing
undfer the laws of this State incurred
the peril of |me or imprisonment for
making any false pretense to defraud
investors or the general public. This
i law reads:
Provided, that this act shall bÂ« construed
to apply only to corporations wfaou capital
stock has been or hereafter shall b* listed at
a stock board or stock exchange in this
State, or whose shares shall be regularly
bought and sold In the stock market in this
State.
The fact Is that few fake mining com
panies succeed in unloading as much
stock on the public in California as
they do in the East. Some California
persons have dealt largely in shares
that have little real value, sending
them to the East to be sold, when the
properties on which the shares have
been based are so well known at home
that the California public would not
take any of their securities at any
price. Nevertheless, although such
mines could never be listed in Califor
nia, the literature issued concerning
them would make them seem to be
very rich in gold or other valuable min
eral deposit. Some operators have been
careful not to circulate any of their lit
erature in California. Aubury's plan is
to strike out the objectionable proviso
that has promoted frauds during a pe
riod of years. He will urge such action

AX IMPORTANT CONTEST
Deeds to Agricultural Lands Do Not
i Include Right to Conduct Min
eral Operations.
The Supreme Court decided yester
day that a deed to agricultural lands
does not per se include the right to
use the property for mineral purposes.
The point was raised in a suit over
mining bairns in ''Amador ."County.* The.
Central Eureka Mining Company was
conducting operations under a mineral
land patent when a rival concern on |
adjoining property attempted to work
the same ledge. An injunction was
sought against the new arrivals. The
amount involved amounts to about
5100,000.
The Eureka Company deeded some
of its land to James and Eliza Toman
for agricultural purposes. The lat
ter immediately laid claim to all the
land within their boundaries clear to
the center of the earth. The East
Central Eureka Mining Company was
formed to work such a part of the old
ledge as lay between the Tomans' lat
eral boundaries.
" The Supreme Court says the orig
inal concern has the right to work out
its leads wherever they may run and
that the Tomans may have the full
enjoyment of their land for agricultu
ral purposes alone.

S. Carty Steals Certificate of Deposit
From Sailor and Is Causrht
by Detectives.
Wilfred Greene, a colored sailor on
the Wisconsin, had a certificate of de
posit for $260 with the Wells-Fargo
Bank stolen from his pocket in a sa
loon at Pine and Dupont streets late
Monday night. He reported his loss
to the police next morning and Detec
tive Bunner was detailed on the case.
Accompanied by Greene, the detec
tive went to the bank and while there
J. S. Cartlett, a grocer on McAllister
street, entered and presented the cer
tificate for payment. When questioned
he said that two men called at his
store and asked him to cash the cer
tificate. He said he only had $50 and
they agreed to take that sum and re
turn for the balance, Cartlett to get
$20 for his trouble. One of the men
had indorsed the certificate as "Wil
fred Greene." They did not return.
Yesterday Bunner arrested S. Carty,
a habitue of the saloon at Pine and
Dupont streets, and Cartlett identified
him as the man who had indorsed the
certificate and got the $50. Charges
of grand larceny and forgery will be
booked against Carty. Bunner and ,
Detective Matheson are searching for f
his accomplice.

STOCKS. â Market was quite irregular again
f-cs.y with znoet of the leading stocks, but
with s. e<-leJtieÂ« strong. The ecgagjssaeut 'of
*â  . 000.000 . -.d for export to-morrow and $2 -
000.000 Saturdar dampened bullish ardor and
there was persistent but quiet selling all
through the list. The greater likelihood of
i;t- legislation was also a factor. The steels
were heavy in iplt* of the report and de
clines were scored by all of those hirh-priced
â¢tocks which were buoyant yesterday.
COTTON. â There was more strength In the
market to-day than for some , time and the
trading was also more' active and the fluctua
tions more frequent and covered a wider range
Title . vas because many large operators here
and at New Orleans-took the bull side of the
market In the hope of at least making a turn
against the enormous short Interest. . There
Â»Â«i a decline of S points from last right's

o\er' yesterday* finals shortly after the pub
lication of the glnners' re*port on good buying
by the. bull operators, and the, roost of the
Improvement was sustained on a continuance
it fairly good support. * â 
GinneVs' report on cotton ginned in 695

reported ginned to December 13 in the 117
counties of 2.749,000 bales, and assume no
more will be ginned after January 16 than
th* 333.000 bales â  reported â  for â  last year the

Future Grain and Provisions;:
t'. CHICAGO, Feb. LiâThe slump in the wheat
market! occurred ' late;ini the i day. >. The opening
was steady, with May a shade lower to a shad**
higher tat $116%@1 17. ;. Increased j receipts <in
: the Northwest had â¢ a tendency Ito 1 create | bear
; ish â â  sentiment at the start," but I news | from | the
' Southwest â¢' was sufficiently ; bullish I toÂ»prevent
any great amount of selling. -t. Arrivals at Kan
sas City and St. Louis to-day were only 44,000
bushels compared with 256.000 bushels a year
ago. After selling off to $1 16Â«i<g>l 16% May
advanced to "$1 17*4 ion , a . fair >, demand j from
commission i. houses. The buying a was 3 partly
the result of tirmness of : cables. -v Extreme ccld
weather: in the Northwest was also ja . decided
: factor. â . The < effect of the â¢ cold C wave, lt -is
1 claimed, - vculd be â¢a . mterial â ; decrease jln i re
ceipts. Later in the day the 3 market was
somewhat affected by the .weakness: of coarse
grains H but showed only a slight loss. During
the ; last ' hour, however, 'j wheat; became ; decid
edly â > weak i following .'â  declines - at f Minneapolis
and St.," Louis. A report ; * from â¢ Minneapolis
that some of the mills . there: would close,; ow
ing- to poor demand for flour, was apparently
the most important influence. - The May op

Harrison's circular says: "Since the steam
ship Sierra left there have been but two ar
rivals of Coal from Newcastle N. S. W.. via. :
T. P. Emlgh. 1640 tons; Bossouet. 3000 tons:
total. 4640 tons. The small deliveries of Aus
tralian Coal slncV the beginning of December
last, in all. 14,500 tons to date, leaves our
stock on hand of colonial CoaJ considerably
diminished; furthermore there are but two
cargoes due to arrive here this month, hence
there will be a depleted stock of foreign Coal
here in March. There are nineteen vessels
on the engaged list to carry Coal from New
castle to this port, their carrying capacity is
at out 45.000 tons, and lt wfll be several months
hence T>efore a number of these cargoes will
be delivered here. The sales prices now ruling
remain unchanged and the quantity changing
hands since the last steamer left Is materially
enlarged, caused by the prevailing rainy
weather. Colonial freight rates on Coe,l Â»e
main firm at unchanged rate*, about fifteen
shillings per ton being the prevailing quotation.
There have been eight deliveries from British
Columbia in January, aggregating ovÂ»r lifi.OOO
tons, which makes it evident that Australia
is a small factor In furnishing us with our
Coal necessities. t*p to date we have had a
most seasonable rainfall to Insure us a large
cereal crop: If <*ur anticipations be ies3Wd
there will be a large demand for tonnage to
carry our products to foreign markets, and
this should be a profitable market for disen
gaged tonnage this year, which may Indues
liberal Coal shipments from Australia. We
yet need a further rainfall to absolutely as
sure us a bounteous harvest."

ciusively for dining purposes, but the
floors above may contain rooms and
sleeping apartments, and the question
of removing doors will not enter into
the discussion.
When the cases were brought up
some months ago Commissioners Hut
ton and Reagan voted to require the
proprietors to remove doors from
apartments before their licenses could
be renewed. Commissioners Drink
house and Howell were in favor of re
newin- the licenses under the old con
dition, but owing to the fact that a
tie vote existed several of the places
were refused licenses. Since Commis
sioner Howell has been succeeded by
Commissioner Pohelm and Commis
sioner Hutton was ousted by the
Mayor the latter's removal left only
Reagan in opposition to the scheme.
â¢as Poheim's idea^ coincided with those
of Drinkhouse on the subject.
LÂ«.st night Abe Ruef, attorney for
the restaurant keepers, presented a
communication, which was read and a
vote taken as to the renewal of licenses
that had been revoked. Reagan main
tained his old stand, but there were

two against him, and the restaurant
men came out victorious. The com
munication read:
Regulations proposed by the hotel and res
taurant proprietors of this city who conduct
the so-caJled French restaurants to comply
with the views and suggestions of the Hon
orable Board of Police Commissioner*:
1. No restaurant license shall include the
right to maintain or conduct, in connection
with the restaurant for which it shall have
been issued, any hotel, lodging-house or room
ing-house.
2. All sÂ»uch establishments operating under
both a hotel and restaurant license shall con
duct the restaurant business Separate and
apart from the hotel business, ana to that end
and purpose there shall not be maintained or
rented any rooming apartments on either the
first or second floors of any premises occupied
by such establlÂ«hments or on any other floor
on which any dining-rooms are situate or
maintained. The first or ground floor and the
second floor may be used exclusively for
dining purposes, and there shall be no bed*,
sofas, lounges or other a;eeptnr accommoda
tions whatsoever on either of such floors.
3. If a hotel, lodging or rooming house busi
ness shall be conducted in connection with
such establishment above the second floor
thereof the same shall be conducted as other
hotels, lodging-houses or rooming-houses are
conducted, under similar licenses.
A reÃiiter must be kept for registering
guests, permanent as well as transient.
In the matter of accommodation, order and
conduct of business the same rules and regu
lations must be followed as apply to any other
hotels, lodging-houses or room ing 'houses in
this city.
The board decided to hold semi-week
ly meetings commencing next week.
The increasing business of the depart
ment makes this necessary. Wednes
day night will be given entirely to the
hearing of applications for liquor and
other licenses at the disposal of the
board arid Friday night will be de
voted to trials both of policemen and
saloon . men. Before the board ad
journed the proprietors of The Turtle,
a saloon located at the corner of Geary
and Powell streets, were granted a li
cense to conduct their business. Owing
to the fact that the old board of Police
Commissioners did not want any saÂ«
loons around Union Square the license
was revoked, but the new board seem
ed favorable to the resort.
DR. S. J. HUNKIN DELIVERS
A LECTURE OX HIP DISEASE
Well Known Authority Gives an In
structive Talk at the Emanu-El
Free Sisterhood.
Dr. S. J. Hunkin, one of the most
noted authorities in the country on
hip disease, lectured last night on this
subject at the Emanu-El Sisterhood,
1248 Folsom street. Dr. Hunkin's talk
was very interesting and instructive.
He illustrated his subject with X-ray
negatives. He also showed his audi
ence bones that had been attacked by
the disease and explained the effect it
has upon the limbs. He said that his
greatest success in treatment had been
achieved where the patient slept out
doors in a tent. Splints, he said, are
now being made that, when placed on
the affected limb, give it rest, which is
necessary for successful treatment of
the disease.

BURGLAR CLIMS
A FIRE ESCAPE
Matron Waite of Episcopal
Old Ladies' Home Awak
ened by Light at Window
Burglars continue to ply their vo
cation In different parts of the city
with more or less success. A daring
attempt to enter the room occupied
by Mrs. Waite, matron of the Old La
dies' Home (Episcopal) .on Golden
Gate avenue, near Masonic avenue,
was made early Tuesday morning.
Mrs. Waite reporteoTto the police that
shortly after 2 o'clock she was awak
ened by a noise outside her bedroom,
and on opening her eyes saw a light
shining through the window. She got
out of bed and walked toward the
window. The "light was flashed in her
face for 'an instant. Then she heard
a noise, as if some one was climbing
down the fire escape. She looked out
of the window and saw the figure of
a man running away. She said she
was in the habit of keeping a large
sum of money in her bedroom to pay
the helD in the home and thinks that
the would-be burglar was aware of
that fact.
J. N. Powell, 37 Shrader street, re
ported to the police yesterday that' a
'burglar had gained admission to his
house by climbing up the waste
pipe during the night to the window
in the bathroom. The burglar, after
stealing Powell's gold watch, valued
at $65, took his departure by way of
the front door.
Mrs. Philomina Nonez, 34 Hinckley
street, reported that on Tuesday night
her house was entered during her
temporary absence and a trunk con
taining $50 in gold, ladies' gold chain
valued at S5, and clothing and under
wear valued at $50, were stolen. En
trance was effected by opening the
front door with a false key. She was
unable to give any clew to the thief.

WILL USE BOTH
FOR PAVEMENTS
Relative Merits of Asphalt
and Bitumen Discussed
at Supervisors' Meeting
The relative merits of asphalt and
bitumen for paving material was dis
cussed yesterday before the Super
visors' Street Committee due to a
recommendation made by City En
gtneer "Woodward that asphalt be
used on H, Mission and other streets.
J. W. McDonald said he was pre
pared to give a bond to keep any
streets paved by him with bitumen In
repair for ten years, and would lay
bitumen pavements in competition
with asphalt. He objected to City
Engineer Woodward's recommenda
tion that asDhalt be laid in the down
town districts, holding that he should
have consulted with contractors and
observed the lasting qualities of the
two pavements before making the
specifications. Woodward said that
McDonald had been consulted.
C. F. Adam of the Barber Asphalt
Company made a plea for the use of
asphalt, which he claimed to be su
perior to bitumen, because it was
scientifically prepared for street pave
ments and is guaranteed for ten years.
Commissioner Aigeltinger submitted
a table showing the comparative du
rability of asphalt and bitumen pave
ments. The asphalt pavement on
Grant avenue, laid in 1901, is reported
in good condition, while that on Polk
street, from Sutter to Jackson, laid in
1902, needs reconstruction badly and
that on Valencia street, from Market
to Eighteenth, laid in 1901, needs im
mediate repair. The asphalt pave
ment on Pine street, from Sansome
to Battery, laid in 1901. was re
paired in the last six months. The
bitumen pavement on Stockton street,
from O'Farrell to Sutter, laid in 1897,
is in good condition; that on Kearny
street, from Sutter to California, laid
in 1893, is in need of slight repair:
that on Bryant street, from Twentieth
to Twenti'-fourth. laid in 1597, is in ser
viceable condition, and that on Golden
Gate avenue, frotai Gough to Laguna
streets, laid in 1897. is in good condi
tion. It is resurfaced and no repairs
were ever made. .The bitumen pave
ment on Market street, from Second
to Twelfth, laid in 1898, needs general
repairs
The committee sustained the rec
ommendation of the City Engineer
and will renort in favor of the use of
both materials.
City Engineer Woodward sub
mittrd a report on proposed amend
ments to the ordinance designating
materials to be used for street paving
so as to permit of the use of asphalt
sidewalks on a concrete base on
broken rock, and asphalt pavement
without a binder course, and the use
of California oil asphalts instead of
the solid natural oil asphalt now re
quired by the ordinance.
