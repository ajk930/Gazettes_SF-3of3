two or three years ago.
VICTORIA. B. C, Sept. 16.â It has

Shearwater is faring. If the naval au
thorities could get the slightest veri
fication of the report that something
has happened to the Shearwater,
which they admit seems not improb
able, as she should have reported at
Comox some days ago, they would im
mediately dispatch a cruiser to her
assistance. -The report of her mishap
came to Nanaimo, Vancouver Island,
through some sealing men returning
from the north. It is known that the
place where the Shearwater is sup
posed to have gone ashore is fre
quently visited by American revenue
cutters, which could render valuable

' ROME. Sept. 16. â The majority of
the people approve the action of King
Victor Emmanuel In not choosing the
title of Prince of Rome for the heir
to the throne, born last night, as it
would have mixed the royal family in
a. party struggle and would have em
bittered the conflict between church
and state at a time when the Pope
seemed to be leaning toward moder
ation. It is believed that the title
chosen, that of Prince of Piedmont,
will become fixed for all time for the
Italian Crown Prince, as is the title
of the Prince of Wales in England.
To .celebrate the birth of the heir
the King has granted amnesty to all
deserters and has also shortened by
six months the terms of Imprisonment

State Senator Victor J. Dowling, who
conferred with Parker during the day,
and later with Charles F. Murphy, to
night said: ,
"Parker has asked me to say that he
feels extremely jubilant and is very
hopeful of the outlook at present. He
returns home to-night well pleased
with the conditions he found existing
here and in particular he is gratified at
the many evidences of harmony that
exist on every hand.- I can say safely
that he feels hopeful in the extreme."
The Governorship and other State
offices were discussed, but it was said
that nothing definite as to the selection
of candidates would be determined un
til next week at Saratoga.
Another matter left open is whether
Judge Parker will make a series of
speeches during the campaign. Other
conferences, similar to those held yes
terday and to-day, will probably be
held next week before Judge Parker's
letter of acceptance Is made public.

. NEW YORK, Sebt. 16.â Several im

man Taggart was not to be super

leaders with Judge Parker resulted in
the settlement of differences In Greater

that prevails in steamship circles. -If

by the shippers. But should. the Korea
coal and leave within the twenty-four

has been dispatched on a mission to
search for vessels now sailing the
North Pacific Ocean with supplies for

Oriental shippers are much worried.
They wonder how many Russian cruis

Special Dispatch to The Call.
A. B. Costigan & Co., grain and com
mission merchants, doing business at
215 Battery street, have failed, with ac
knowledged liabilities amounting to
$120,759 60, and assets estimated at $48,
â¬02 60. Yesterday their attorneys, A. R.
Needles and W. D. Grady, filed a peti
tion in bankruptcy in -the United States
District Court for the Northern District
of California and asked for the appoint
ment of a receiver. The. case will come
up in court to-day before Judge de
Haven.
The members of the firm of A- B. Cos
tigan &. Co. are A. B. Costigan and F.
C. Gibbons. The schedules filed yester
day in court with the petition to be de
clared bankrupt set forth that the cred
itors include relatives, to whom large
amounts are said to be due. E. N. Cos
tigan. a relative of A. B. Costigan, is
creditor to the amount of $46,654 "1, and
to J. N. Costigan, another relative, the
sum of J74S2 OS is owing. E. C. Evans,
agent for Dewar & Webb of London,
files one claim for $4S23 78 and also one
for $S5S 92. The secured indebtedness
amounts to $23,700. The largest amount
secured to one creditor is $14,800, to the
Farmers 1 Union Milling Company of
Stockton. D. B. Fairbanks of Petaluma
is secured by deed and conveyance in
the amount of 5S000. The First Nation
al Bank- of San Fraac-Jsco -holds waro
fcsouse receipts for grain in warehouse
to the amount of $9300.
The action of the firm in taking
bankruptcy proceedings was precipi
tated by the First National Bank of
Pan Francisco, which gave notice early
this week that it must have its money
within three days, the alternative being
legal proceedings. It had come to the
knowledge of the bankers that the firm
had been speculating in grain, on the
wrong side of the maj-ket, figuring out
that tho price cf wheat -would fall. The
ptice rose, and the result of this turn
in the market was disastrous to the
firm.
On the face of the schedules the ex
tpfs of liabilities above assets Is $72,
153 S6. Outside of the business of the
house the partners appear to have com
paratively little property. The real
property ofCostigan is estimated to be
worth $17,000. This includes two ware
houses, one at Sanser and one at Clo

The Russian transport Lena, which
has been the cause of much discussion
and consternation since her arrival
here last -Sunday, went up to Mare
Island yesterday. There she will be
dismantled. Her departure from the
bay is a great relief to Admiral Good
rich. Not that the Admiral feared she
would do any harm to the shipping
and the merchant marine in the har
bor, but it was her presence here that
he feared might result in a demonstra
tion from those unfriendly to her and
to her cause. As soon as she weighed
anchor yesterday and turned her bow
up the stream the Marblehead acted as
her escort to the navv yard. On her
arrival there she found Admiral Mc-
Calla and his staff waiting to receive
her. She then passed from the juris
diction of the commandant of the fleet
in this harbor to that of the command
ant of the navy yard. Her dismantling
will be begun at once. Her guns will
be removed by Her own crew and
turned over to the charge of Admiral
McCalla. These he will keep charge
of until the Russo-Japanese war is
over, or until such time as the Presi
dent may indicate that they are to be
returned.

look after the interests of the vessel
and he hoped that the Admiral could
see his way clear to communicate with
the Government and arrange . matters
in this manner.
Admiral Goodrich and his fleet will
leave port this morning at 11 o'clock.
The fleet Includes the flagship New

change is regarded as possible. Should
it prove to be true, there are reasons

LONDON*. Sept. 16.â A dispatch to a

issued by 4ier.eta.l Kuropaikin- to-day
the following message from Emperor
Nicholas to the general was published:
"I see from your report" that you
vere unable to hold the fortress of
Liaoyanfr. owing to the enemy threat
ening to cut off your communications.
The retreat of the whole army in such
Olflirult circumstances and over such
terrib!<* roads was an operation excel

UifflcuJtics. I thank you and your
splendid troops for their heroic and
continued self-sacrifice. God guard
you. NICHOLAS."
Commenting on his Majesty's mes
sage, Oeueral Kuropatkin says it con
tains further expression of lofty benev
olence on the part of the Emperor, and
adds:
"I am auite sure that. in the work
that lies before the Manehur'an army
every soldier will put forth his best
effort? tj achieve victor}" over the
enemy and become worthy of the con

Kuropatkin ordered the Emperor's
message to be read to all the troops
with solemn ceremony.

The evacuation of the railway sta

the most admirable coolness and dis

to carry all the artillery. At the last
moment the First Siberian Flying Ar

which the soldiers loaded their six-inch
mortars by hand and then pushed the
truck across the river under a direct
It was decided on the night of Sep
tember 3 to abandon Liaoyang. The fol
lowing day all the stores were removed
from the forts around the city, from
the Russian settlement and from Liao
yang. and the dead were, buried and
sentries gradually withdrawn. A ter
rible hall of projectiles was falling In
the city, especially in the. .Church
Square and around the house where
General Kuropatkin had been living.
The evacuation was , productive of
many deeds of heroism and self-sac
rifice. By an oversight a sentry at the
commissariat store was not relieved
and remained at his post. A similar
fate almost overtook a little guard of
engineers at a warehouse close to the
Chinese wall, who was not relieved
until the commander of the garrison,
making a final round, ordered them off.
The building had already been set on
fire by Japanese shells. The men
marched out, carrying their tools, under
a hail of projectiles.
RETREATING UNDER FIRE.
The Japanese flre was terrific and
mowed down whole companies, but the
Neshinsks went on, gaining .ground
inch by inch till, finally, they reached
the top. Then there was a frightful
hand to hand struggle. The Japanese
were obliged to fall back, and ithe
Neshinsk Regiment occupied the hill,
which they managed to hold until even
ing. Then, unable to withstand the
concentrated artillery fire, of the Jap
anese, the Neshinsks had to descend.
Its terrible fight cost the regiment more
than half its men and three-fourths of
its officers. The heights will henceforth
be known among the Sevententh Corps
as "Xeshinsk HilL"
Nine companies of the Tenth Euro
pean Regiment held this hill, supported
on the right by the Bolkhoff regiment,
with the Xeshinsk regiment in reserve.
Here occurred the most brilliant en
counter and "the most desperate fight
ing of the whole battle. On September
1 the Japanese concentrated their ar
tillery fire upon the hill and by evening
occupied it. The Neshinsk regiment
was ordered on the next day to retake
the hill, and after artillery preparation,
headed by its colonel on horseback, the
regiment tried to rush the heights.

STORY OF THE FIGHTING.
STv PETERSBURG, Sept. 16, 5;;35
p. m.â The Associated Press dispatches
from Mukden announcing that, accord
ing to information from Chinese
sources, the Japanese are leaving a
garrison at Liaoyang and their main
force is concentrating at Bentsiaputze,
twenty miles southeast of'' Mukden, and
that another force, whose strength has
not been established, is moving up the
Liao Valley. The greater part of Field
Marshal Oyama's army, however, is
still near Yentai, encamped along the
heights between the mines and the rail
roads. While the "War Office does not
expect an. immediate advance, the pre
liminary dispositions, of the Japanese
forces are taken to indicate that the
Japanese intend, when they advance, to
strike from the eastward. They seeem
to be avoiding the territory west of the
Liao River, possibly because.it is flat
and. would give the Russians! the ad
vantage of their superiority in cavalry.
Chinese residents fleeing to Mukden
complain that" the Japanese are pil
laging Liaoyang.
General Sakharoff telegraphs a formal
denial of several of Oyama's state
ments. . He says the alleged dumdum
.bullets, found "at Liaoyang are simply
the' regulation square nosed bullets of
the service revolver. They are of the
same caliber as the Russian rifle of
1891 and the bullets are all lead, are not
jacketed and are in no wise dumdums.
The general also denies the statement
that . the Japanese captured a large

Kuropatkin's army preparatory to an
advance toward Mukden. While it is
not in a. position to confirm or deny

To that extent Â¦ ' Count LamsdorfC's
reply to Embassatior McCormick may
not be satisfactory * to the United
State!!. Count Lamsdorff's victory -in
this controversy, while not absolutely
complete, is perhaps noteworthy as
having been achieved against powerful
adverse interests. At one time it seem
ed doubtful whether any - concessions
could be obtained, but yesterday the
Emperor sanctioned the decision, which
Count Lamsdorff communicated to Em
bassador Hardinge to-day.
IX)NDON, Sept. 16.' â The Foreign
Office has received a dispatch-from Em
bassador Hardinge, at St. Petersburg,
giving Russia's reply to the representa
tions on the subject of contraband of
war. While disinclined to express an
opinion, it is understood that the For
eign Office considers the reply as sat
isfactory, inasmuch as the concessions
are a distinct yielding on the part of
the Russian Government to the claims
of Great Britain. It is said at the For
eign Office that, while anything like a
crisis was averted by the reply, it does
not close the matter completely,^ and
further discussion will probably ensue.
Foreign Secretary Lansdowne and
Premier Balfour are both absent, but
Sir Charles Hardinge's dispatch was
forwarded to them, -and pending their
action nothing is available at the For
eign Office beyond a general expression
of opinion that the reply goes a long
way toward settling the question as
to what, in the future, may be properly
regarded as contraband of war. Accord
ing to the British. view, there are still
open certain questions of principle, -but
it Is believed that these will be ar
ranged in the course of further nego-
MAY NOT SUIT AMERICA.
In this way Russia preserves her
dignity by not making an open purien
der. - it the same time consenting to the
interpretation asked for by the United
States and Great Britain in the interest
of the rights of the neutral commerce.
In rome respects, however, there is
good ground for the belief that the con
tention of the United Statesâ that :ail
way material and certain kinds of ma
chinery be classed as conditionalcon
trabandâwill not be accepted.
Russia, in Count Lamsdorff's re
sponse to Embassador Hardlnge, in
principle meets the views of the "Amer
ican and the British Governments re
garding foodstuffs and coal and other
fuel as being conditional contraband
of war, distinctly placing them in the
category of articles susceptible of uses
both in war and peace, and, as such,
only confiscatable when consigned to
blockaded ports or destined to military
or naval forces of the enemy.
Count Lamsdorff s reply was not pre
sented in written form, but was com
municated verbally to EmbassadoT
Hardtnge. It will not involve public
amendment of the Russian contraband
and prize regulations, but, in effect, it
becomes an official interpretation of
the original regulations made by the
commission composed of representa
tives of the Ministries of Foreign,Af
fairs, Marine. War and Justice, which
considered the subject in connection
with the' objections raised by the
United States and Great Britain and,
as such, will hereafter govern naval
commanders and prize courts, which
thus far in the war have classed all
articles enumerated in article 6 of. the
Russian. regulations as absolute contra
band.. ? â¢ . . .-.. ... . .;.
AS TO FOODSTUFFS.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 16. 7:26
"p. m.â Russia has given her answer to
the American and British notes on the
subject of contraband of war. Her
answer was communicated to Embas
sador Hardlnge this afternoon verbally
by Foreign Minister Lamsdorff. The
Embassador was informed in effect
that according to the decision of the
commission. which has investigated the
subject, the Government has agreed to
the view as to conditionally contraband
character for foodstuffs and that sup
plementary instructions had been is
sued to the Russian naval command
ers and prize courts, calling their at
tention to the misinterpretation which
had been placed upon the prize regu
lations. These instructions, Sir Charles
Hardinge was informed, make a clear
distinction between the. articles enu
merated in article six of the Russian
prize regulations which are susceptible
to dual use, like fuel and foodstuffs,
the acsumpt4on being that if they are
addressed to private persons or firms
in an enemy's port they* are not In
tended for warlike uses; but their in
nocent character may be subiect to
suspicion if the ship's papers and the
circumstances are irregular. In effect
the new instructions will place the
burden of proof that the foodstuffs,
etc., are designed for belligerent pur
poses'upon the captor.
The new 'instructions will involve a
reversal of the judgment of the
Vladivostok prize court by the Ad
miralty court In the case of the pro
visions confiscated. A direct answer
to the American note is expected to
morrow.

ent of the Oriental bureau of the
Women's Home Missionary Society of
the Methodist EplscoDal church, has
applied for the , guardianship of Mee
Ho, a 16-year-old Chinese girl. *
In the application it is alleged that
-Mee Ho "Is now held in the custody
of Jun Kun, a Chinese, her godfather,
at the detention shed in this city and
county against the will of the said
minor, for the purpose of marrying:
her to one Tong Leong against her
will and. wish,, as said minor is desir
ous of attending school under the in
struction of, the Oriental bureau of
the Women's Home Missionary So
ciety."
It is further set forth in the peti
tion for gruardianship that the peti
tioner believes the "- so-called god
father, Jun Kun,- "belongs to the so
called highbinder class of Chinese,
said class having no respect for our
laws."
It is added that if Jun Kun were
aware of the present action he would
immediately attempt to secrete the
girl and take her out of, the jurisdic
tion of the San , Francisco courts. "

The Earl of Euston has accepted

that of bringing American and Briton
closer together, was one he had long
had at heart and was a work in which
he would.be happy to engage.

The strict surveillance kept over the
Chinese women on exhibition at ttie
St. Louis fair, requiring a personal re
port from each of them every twenty
four hours, has discouraged the lead
erc of the ring here, formed to bring
thtse women for the purpose of traffic.
A cable has been sent from San Fran

portation of those waiting there.
Among these are the rest of the

health officers in Hongkong. The four
allowed to come were the pick of the

Industrial and commercial -progress Is
slow, but ;rÂ»>ne the less , definite. Low
temperatures and some injury to crops
provide the only adverse influences of
the week, and this has little effect upon
manufacturers and traders, who have
started to prepare for increased busi
ness. Buyers of dry goods, clothing
and millinery are notably active in
placing orders, and other staple lines
also feel the effect of gradually expand
ing confidence. Even if the official crop
estimates of September 1 have to be
moderately reduced because . of bad
weather since that date, there is full
compensation to growers in the en
hancement of the prices, and the
strength of securities indicates the
faith of the financial world. Many mills
and furnaces have resumed because of
new orders or adjustment of wage
scales, and prices are steadier in most
cases. It is not unusual to hear fall
trade spoken bf as fully equal to last
year's, although . collections are not
prompt at several cities. Freight trafr
flc blockades are not as frequent as
they were at this time in 1903, yet there
is occasional complaint, and earnings
in September were 5 per cent larger

It is said that among the California ex

"The ridiculousness of this statement
Is attested by the table printed in the
report of the California State Board of
Trade on the shipment of fruit out of
the State by rail in 1904." said one of
the northern district exhibitors yester
day. "This taWe shows that Northern

Founded when the mission system
was on the wane, owing to the sap
ping of Its vital forces by the greedy
Mexican officials. Santa Ynez was
spared much of the tragedy, aye, and
the comedy, of its older sisters.
Perhaps, should the old church find
Here is presented but one phase of
the marvelous work of the padres,
this rearing in a wilderness, wholly
without mechanical -aid and with un
tutored workmen, this splendid struc
ture, with its long row of sheltering
arches and its turreted belfry.
Santa Ynez much resembles Mis
sion .San Miguel, save that the belfry
is a part of the facade, rising- above
the tiled roof with a line dignity and
bearing aloft a large cross, the em
blem of the church. About the fa
cade, outlining the sides and the roof
beams, runs a broad dark band of
reddish paint, forming the one dis
tinctive Indian decoration on the ex
terior. But within are many crude
carvings of the children of the woods
and there, too, remain some of the
statues of the old days when the land
was young.
were treated with kindness and affec
tion by the . Spaniards the captains
withdrew this opposition and came
with the younger lads to be<?ome neo
phytes.
And their maidens came â came to sit
in the patio of the mission, with its
pomegranates blooming red and the
roses of Castile blowing their sweet
breath into the purpling vine â there to
learn the story of Jesus of Nazareth.'
Aye, and more! Here they learned
to weave the cloth that would drape
their sinuous bodies, to weave the
blankets and linen used in the mis
sion. So, too,. they learned to make
the altar cloths, drawn in native de
signs, after the traditions of their peo
ple.
And as the neophytes grew in num
bers the primitive chapel gave way to
the imposing structure that to-day
dominates the valley.
In this conflict â the largest that ever
took place In California between the
Indians and the gente de razon (people
of, reason, therefore the "white peo
ple") four hundred natives were en
gaged. The Spaniards, who numbered
one hundred, lost one of their brave
band in the defense of the sanctuary-
With military honors, he was laid to
rest in the 1 churchyard under the hill.
Then in 1836 came the oomisionados,
with their decree of secularization.
V/ith a large sweep of the arm of
Mexican might the mission of Santa
Ynez was no more. And with the
passing of the birds in that fateful
fall, so too went the padres back to the
cloisters In Mexico or in Spain, to
pday and weep for the children they
loved but lost.
Still the old church- stands to-day to
tell the tale of a century. And in that
century the flags of three nations have
waved over its domain. And it . has
seen the passing of the two peoples who
gave it birthâ the Spaniard and the In
dian. > .
So too has it known the passing of
the days when life was as a prling
stream, flowing gladly through flower-
Ing meadows on to the sea.
.Thus the century passeth! And to
day will these things be \told within
the sanctuary blessed with a century's
incense.
a. living voice to-day, on its hundredth
birthday it would tell of', the great
earthquake of 1S12, when its rafters
were wrenched and its" arches pitched
out of plumb, and the neophytes went
screaming into the patio calling for
help from the Holy Mother. And it
might tell of the rain of arrows that
scarred its face in 1824, when the In
dians from Purisima and those from
the mountains bore down upon it, on
destruction bent; and of how th friars
and- the mission guard bravely defend
ed the sacred place, . until relief came
from Santa Barbara, when the Indians
were repulsed, leaving sixteen "good"
Indians on the field.
John M. Burnett, on behalf of the
Archbishop of Spain, supported Lyons'
argument. He read from another de
jfcision of the Supreme ; Court to the
effect that the trial court should only
allow what any prudent man could get
I the services done for. Burnett claimed
j that Judge Coffey's decisions of allow
ances to attorneys for twenty-one
years past had virtually established the
proper and customary fees In such
I cases and should be considered by
' Judge Troutt in this case.
Charles F. Hanlon's argument for the
attorneys asking for the fee was sen
sational. He said there were Judges on
the bench who "fouled" the judicial
"nest" by their attitude against allow
ing attorneys what they asked. He
also- spoke severely of attorneys who
resisted brother attorneys in their at
tempts to get fees out of estates and
characterized such . conduct as "foul
ing" the "nest" of the bench as well
as the "nest", of the bar. These re-,
marks of Hanlon were objected to by
Lyons, who demanded that the names
of the. Judges and lawyers be given.
Hanlon refused the demand and Lyons
was unable to get JudjRe Troutt to rule
! In favor of his request. Lyons says
[that when the -court reporter, tran-
I scribes the argument he will take pro
ceedings against Hanlon based upon
this language reflecting on the Integ-
I rityof the bench and bar.
Argument was concluded yesterday
I before' Judge Troutt upon the claim of
j Bradley & McKiristry for a $25,000, fee
! as attorneys to the Guardiola estate.
| The trial of the case consumed many
days of examination of attorneys call
ed for and against the claim. Eleven
j lawyers testified, and their valuation
! of the services varied considerably,
ranging from $4000 to 525,000. Â¦
Judge James M. A\len thought $4000
would be proper and gave his reasons,
specifying the value of -the different
elements of the services. A. Comte,
who Is also a Supervisor, fixed the fee
at from $10,000 to $15,000. while J. F.
Cavagnaro â¢ thought $8000 to' $10,000
would be a good fee. .Judge Van Fleet
testified that in his opinion the fee de
manded was reasonable. v\
Timothy J. Lyons, arguing for the
daughter of deceased, Mrs. Christobal
of Spain, who is resisting the demand
for the $25,000 fee, quoted two decisions
of the Supreme Court giving the views
of that tribunal, as . to the conduct Â«.of
.attorneys . and ' trial courts in passing
upon fees.' These decisions severely Te
buked the legal profession for the will
ingness of its members in testifying
to the correctness of any fee demanded
by a brother attorney and also reflect
ed upon the attitude and action of
trial judges in accepting such testi
mony and allowing enormous amounts
to. attorneys against dead, men's es
tates. * . ; ,
In the Blythe case, Justice Garoutte
said: "Attorneys are inclined to place
a very high estimate upon the value of
their | services when rendered in im
portant litigation, and also inclined to
look with kindly eyes and sympathetic
feelings upon the efforts of brother at
torneys in establishing before the court
the value of services performed in
large estates .fortunate enough to pos
sess well filled coffers." .The . court
added that "the lower court' should
temper this kind of evidence with its
own calm judgment, based upon the
amount and kind of labor performed."
In a very recent, decision (estate of
Byrne) the. Supreme Court, Lyons said,
spoke .even more pointedly as to the
conduct of trial judges in this class of
cases. The decision, Lyons declared,
charged the lower court with being In
the position of a trustee of the estate
and, as such, had "no right to be liberal
with the money of the heirs of the dead
man," and it commented upon the fact
that "too often" it had "viewed with
grave perturbation the action of trial
judges in allowing enormous ; fees . to
attorneys from moneys over which they
were charged with the high duties of
trustees," and of its frequent expres
sion of "its extreme ' regret as to this
manifest abuse."

The better class of druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devoto their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal, agents of known value, in accordance with chysicians' prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture ' many excellent remedies, but
always under original or. officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitatjon medicines.
They are themen to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts *of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises fro,m a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon. their patron3 and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know "that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always .take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of tfce Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases; of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the live* and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestiorj, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects aa
Syrup of Figs, ancl they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been , made,- tried and condemned, .but there are
individual druggists to be founid, here and the/e, .who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession arid whoso. greed gets the -better bf their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations* in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
iometimes have the nameâ -" Syrup of Figs"â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup ycbmpany,'. printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Company-^California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because^ they 'are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to^inisre'presentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or '/Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full nameoftKeCaliforhia Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attemptingtp deceive, and;mislea^' the.patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be la_rge*or smalli.for if, the. dealer resorts to- misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he wiltdb bo with others medicinal agents,- and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by^every 9ne who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority; bf druggists, are we supply the immense demand
for. our excellent -remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, : at the regular price oi fjfty cents per bottle,- but as exceptions
exist it Is .necessary to inform 1 the public of the facts, in order, that all may decline or return
any' imitation which may be sold-to them. - If if does not bear the full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the" front of every package^ do not hesitate to return the
article arid to demand the return of your money,*and;in future go to one of the better class of
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of every thing in his line at reasonable prices.

I take all this a* stmply a matter of course.
For homes for religion, for education, for

OAKLAND, Sept. 16.â Grace Mc-
Naughton, under examination on a
charge of stealing finery from the resi
dence of Mrs. Thomas Mein, where she
had been employed as a maid, was re
leased from custody on htr own .re
cognizance this afternoon by Justice of
the Peace James G. Quinn. This ac
tion was taken after the second day's
hearing of the grand larceny charge.
Attorney A. L. Frick made the request
on behalf of his client, pointing out
that Miss McNaughton was in wretched
physical condition and could not obtain
bail. To the request, District Attorney
J. J. Allen and Attorney G. W. .Baker,
special counsel for Mrs. Mein, made no
objection. Â¦
After her release Miss McNaughton
was taken to San Francisco by her sis
ter, Mrs. Maud Ramsey.
During the examination this after
noon before Justice Quinn, Clara Hag
gett, who also had been a maid at the
Mein residence during Grace Mc-
Nadghton's stay there, threw volleys
of "I don't remembers" at District At
torney Allen. He tried to bring out
the occurrences and conversations that
took place in Chief of Police Hodgklns'
office when Miss' Haggett. Grace Mc-
Naughton, Mrs. Mein, - Detective A.
Shorey and Hodgkins, it appeared,
were holding a "heart to heart" con
ference, at which the girls had con
fronted each other in the police in
quiry concerning Mrs. Mein's complaint
of theft.
Miss Haggett, as she declared her
own name, though she is known as
La Perle, from her stepfather, vaguely
remembered about a valise and a yel
low box that had been seen In Miss
McNaughton's room.. The questioning
of Miss Hagfgrett by* the District Attor
ney continued as follows: â¢ ,"''
Do you retnember a conversation you had
with tbe Chief of Police In which you enumer
ated th* things taken from Mrs. Mein's house?
I don't remember.
Do you remember what you told him?
No.
Didn't you tell the Chief of Police who
took the things?
I. don't remember.
Didn't you; in the t>reÂ»=neÂ« of Grace Mc-
Naughton, enumerate * the things taken? and
didn't you say â¢ Grace had taken them? and
didn't she deny It? and didn't you then say
"You know better, you little thief, you did"?
Yes.
Now what did GYace say in response?
I don't remember.
"Well, there were others present at
that Interview," said Allen, replying to
objections from Attorney Frick, "we
can call the Chief of Police."
â¢ "Call him, call him," declared Frick.
"I wish you would call him, but I don't
think you will."
This colloquy excited interest as hint
ing that the* defense will contend that
the police made* promises to the Mc-
Naughton girl which would, if proved,
negative any testimony they might give
against her. Both sides excused Miss
Haggett, her testimony having
amounted to nothing. Mrs. William
Howiett, wife of a police patrol wagon
driver identified hose supporters, a
piece of jet-beaded lace sleeve material
and a bed pillow as having been given
to her by Grace McNaughton, who had
roomed at the Howletts'.
The examination will be resumed
Tuesday. â¢.

I feel that if I did not corae forward and ssy
a word for the bonds ,1 should bÂ« remiss in my
duty to th* people. Our city has suffered In
the past from a dreamy drowsiness.** financial
malaria. .In the .midst of our lovely hones we
have been looking across the bay to criticise.
Rather should we have kept our eyes upon
ourselves and put a strong hand at the wheel
ot Improvements. WÂ« ' should unite - to help
out nature. We should make one great effort
rather than to let the feeble spasmodic move
ments of the past be all that we can record.
For nearly thirty years I hav# been In this
fair city of ours. I . have seen and heard a
grea# dsal about its progress and setbacks.
its health, wealth and morals. Its schools,
churches. ;ts beauty and . tasts and so on. the
same old tone. Some of us long for a change.
We are awake at last to the n*Â«d of putting
on , speed. Already this city has grown a.pacÂ«
in thres or four years, and Just now thtre Is
being opened a fleld of progress and prosperity
where every one can work.* In the past' wÂ«
have hid tÂ» do, with a child, but already our
city.U a young lady. The Infant's days are
past. If we love our city It Is time now to
show her off at her best. Carry out this idea
in all US * phases and > belongings and then
without hesitating you conclude that It re
quires money. Â¦ If you , will have" boanty and
utility you must pay for it. If you do not
â¢waM Â¦- to fulfill - your.: ideal Of a city - as Â¦ onÂ«
should ~ be. : lÂ«t her .remmln â¢ unkempt. Â¦ tn < rÂ»Â«s

IMPELLED TO SPEAK.
We have an able, honest and upright city
government. We have a Major and Cif Coun
cil composed of men of such character as cities
eeldem secure for their public servants. Bare
ly does .i city get the splendid services of such
a man of affairs as John Ia Howard, who.
with his committee, devoted hours and hours
of labor to the work on these bonds. If wÂ«
want to continue to have th* Â«*rvlcÂ«3 of such
men as theae we must stand - behind them in
their labors. Otherwise it Is a case of any old
thing la the way of government ia *ood enough
for OakUnd. I feel strongly and firmly that
failure to carry the bonds will give thiÂ» city
a black eye that will cutlast our lifetime and
the lifetimes of our children. Men talk about
taxes. For I myself, I would like for once In
my time to pay taxes that would mean some
thing ; for the beauttfication. the health and
convenience of our city. â¢ â¢
When thÂ« late X. W. Spaulding was Mayor
of Oakland twenty-five year* ago he bought a
lot of school kites. For that he was abused
and vilified as a real estate speculator. You
and I have cause to regret that he did net buy
five times the amount of land that he did pur
chase for the city. Take time by the forelock.
Secure these properties when you can, WÂ«
bonded 160 acrC3 ten years ago fh .West Oak
land for park purposes. You cannot get them
to-day for three times the figure for which
we made options. We need not mourn about
the' so-callt-d burdens our bonds will lay upon
posterity. By the time posterity begins to pay
taxes the property which we shall buy now will
be worth tlve times what we ehall pay for It.
If we desire to stand well In the eyes of those
who shall come after ' us wÂ« will earn the
thanks of posterity by voting these bonds.
I am convinced that the thing to do I* to
vote fcr all -of the bonds and to make- these
uplendiU Improvements that are contemplated.
If the bonus fall to carry. I shall feel that
every fcot of property that I own In tills city
will bÂ« Injured. ; Â¦ ; 
: Chairman Morrison introduced . the
Rev. J. B. McNally as one who had
always spoken for progress and bet
torment. Father McNally said:
Now it Is going to raise our taxes. Of
course it la. But for the first year it will be
only 31 cents on the $loo and each year of the
forty-year issue there Is a reduction steadily
and undoubtedly there will be a steady in
crease in our assessment roll. For myself, I
own considerable property In Oakland. Some
of It is not worth as much now as it was
twenty-three years ago. I am not afraid to
pay a few more taxes. In fact I should be
mighty glad to pay taxes on more valuation if
I could be sure that the bonds would carry.
There has been in West Oakland some com
plaint concerning tbe bond projects. I assure
you West Oakland ha* received average fair
treatment and this ia only * beginning. I call
your attention to the projects for this section
of the city. We have no Just cauce to make
complaint. And Sather Park ought to be
bought. It ia a splendid location. This is only
the commencing of a very comprehensive park
system. Whenever the people realize th* value
of and benefits from surface Improvements they
always want more. This proposed park system
stretching across the city Â¦ Is the start of a
splendid work. And we must make this start.
ABLE RULERS AT WORK.
It Is singular that such a proposition a* is
before ' the city should attract such languM
public attention. It may be that a majority
of the people have concluded the debate in
favor ot the bonds. I feel that this ia a. se
rious matter for Oakland. This bond proposi
tion has bÂ«en advertised all over the coast.
If Oakland defeats the bonds it will have a
very bad effect upon the city. It were better
if they are to be beaten that the bonds should
never have been proposed. San Francisco' a
bond Issue of $18,000,000 for surface Improve
ments, ltke those proposed here, haÂ» been val
idated by the Supreme Court. l,os Angeles.
progressive city that it is, without a natural
water park, issued bonds and made one. Port
land. Seattle and other coast cities are going
ahead. I am satisfied that it would be a
very alarming matter for Oakland if these
bonds are beaten.
W. W. Morrison, president of the
West Oakland Improvement Club, was
chairman. He presented CoTonel Irish,
who said: . . t
, In eloquent words John P. Irish and
the Rev. J. B. McNally, pastor of St-
Patrick's Church, drove home to-night
before an audience at West Oakland
solid arguments in favor of the bond
issue, which will be submitted to the
voters of Oakland on September 27.
Both speakers, endowed above the
average with gift of tongue, presented
to the residents of the western side
of the city a mass of facts, figures and
strong points. Particularly -was it
shown to those assembled at Alcatraz
Hall that West Oakland had been well
favored in . the number, of items in the
bond issue, which were to be of direct
benefit to that section of the city.
In his address Colonel Irish specially
called attention to the fact that the
bonding proposition called for the pur
chase of the De Fremery property at
Sixteenth and Adeline streets; the park
playgrounds at the edge of the north
western end of the city, and" the al
lowance for the improvement of the
West Oakland Park. He showed that
this balanced the amount "allowed to
East Oakland, with the overweight
centered in the project to buy the
"Central Park" site, the Sather foot
hill tract, to form the keystone in a
magnificent arch of municipal improve
ments, for which the present bonding
plan is but the beginning.
Father McNally dwelt more upon the
esthetic side of the subject. The cler
gyman argued tbat there could be no
improvement of the city that would
not be of advantage to every one in it.
"Oakland is beautiful to the man with
thousands of dollars," said the cleric.
"It is equally beautiful to the man with
ten cents. The man with the dime has
just as much interest in this proposi
tion as the man with the thousands.
We have Oakland, endowed magnifi
cently with natural charms. To make
them more magnificent it iÂ» our duty
to expand upon them. Let us do that
and to invite of her very beauty thou
sands to come to us and enjoy with us
the beauties and advantages which we
can obtain by the spending of this
money."

A word to the women. There Is no reason
why the women cannot interest themselves,
too. I should like to tell you about the work
of "JAne- Addams in Chicago, i Her services
there, I dare say. have been more valuable
than those of the men. You 1 who have the
privilege of an education ought to have the
strength and equipment to accomplish things.
If yon were to analyze what you are here for
you ' would find that It means service. It Is
the 'duty of you all to Â«nter the realm of
politic)", 'and if yoo do not intere*t yourself
you had better, ki the language of Bill Nye.
"wrap your cellar door about you and lie
down to :ilÂ«asant dreams."
The game of politics Is worth while. It Is
a game that I recommend to every one within
the sound of my voice. It Is mora complicated
than chess and more strenuous than football.'
It will satisfy you if you are pugnacious. But
I advise you not to attempt politics for mere
ambition's sake, for a man then discounts
himself. It is better not to be handicapped
by any weight or ambition, for then you lose
your influence and people lost their interest
â¢in you. â¢ .
San Francisco offers a beautiful field for
this kind of work. It is an cany fleld, because
San Francisco with its new charter has thÂ«
mechanical foundation for good government,
and this makes reform easier. One trouble
with San Francisco is that its new charter
Is an attempt to concentrate power in tha
hands of the Mayor, It worked very well
until the people elected a weak man. In Chi
cago the aim has been to distribute 'the power
somewhat.
You will find that rottenness tn most alt
municipal governments. In Northern cities
the Democrats ordinarily use the police for
graft. ' The Republicans go in for bigger
things and use legitimate power for their ends.
The commonly attributed cause of municlpa.1
rottenness is the apathy of the people. It
does not seem common sense to be minding
the business of the State when you could be
more profitably minding your own business.
We found many people* applauding our efforts
until we began to probe too deeply for them. .
Then it was that -we dug up the connection
between evil legislation and the business in
terests. There was a "howl" and we. were
called anarchists, enemies of the city and
other unpleasant things. This proved that
more people were profiting by the reign of
graft than was commonly supposed.
As for the methods of cleaning a corrupted
city, publicity Is the most potent. In Chicago
we had some good honest newspapers back
of ub and we got the crowd awakened. We
had to get Into practical politics. There is
no better educator than practical politics. It
reveals people as they really are. I woul/i
advlM a young man to get into politics. With
disinterested motives ana a willingness to
learn from mistakes great results can be ac
complished. The time is ripe. The people are
ready to respond to higher Ideals if you get
them' stirred up. anfl in this direction the
press of Chicago and elsewhere is doing ex
cellent work. â¢
In the methods of work those hostile to
decency find nothing better than the party to
serve ! their ends. Now, there are no such
things as parties among the grafters. The
grafters are always non-partisan. The par
ties are really divided between the men Who
steal door mats and those who do not. That
14 the Une of cleavage. It Is absurd to talk
about parties doing anything in municipal
politics. The Republican party freed the
8l&ves-and it looted Philadelphia. The Demo
crats, if they nave ever done anything ad
mirable, have also corrupted Louisville and
robbed St. Louts.
By hard â¢ work we succeeded In . changing
thincs, *o that now the city la governed in a
fairly economic way and with little or no
corruption. We succeeded in awakening an
interest In civic affairs. The situation is now
more hopeful, because thÂ« people have been
educated to higher Ideals of citizenship.
I suppose it was my Inherent pugnacity that
prompted me to "butt" into Chicago politics in
1895. They elected me an Alderman and 1
went In to learn things. Before long- I learned
tbat the city government waa totally inadequate
and rotten. There were sixty-eight Aldermen
In the Council and there were only ten of
those who wouldn't a teal door mats and mllK
cans.
Mr. Kent said - these things, and a
great many more," in the presence of a
thousand students this morning at the
University of â¢ California, before which
ho had been invited to speak upon
"Municipal Reform." This is a subject
with which Mr. Kent has had a great
deal to; do, for he has successfully
fought the allied corrupt ionists in Chi
cago for ten years. His knowledge of
municipal affairs extends not only to
his own great city, but to others. That
he has an intimate knowledge of San
Francisco affairs was manifest when
he referred to the conditions of the new
charter and the Mayor, whom he de
scribed as weak. In part Mr. Kent said:
William Kent of Chicago advises all
Americans to enter the realm of poli
ticsâwomen . as well as men. Only
through the interest of the good folk of
the land, he says, can Americans hope
for clean municipal government. It is
the apathy of the American people that
is responsible for municipal evils, and
this must be overcome. Practical poli
tics must take .the place of spasmodic
reform movements, and the people must
deal with their problems in a practical
way. ,'.-Â¦Â¦. ' . Â¦ . Â¦. Â¦

County and G. E. Milnes of. Martinez
ir presented Contra Costa County, and
there was a full gathering of the Ala
meda County members. The work was
I>rincipally to begin the campaign in
the interests of J. R. Knovrland for
Congress, to succeed Victor H. Metcalf,
and the different committeemen .gave
expression to the desires from their
section of the district.
This was the way in which George
AV. Hoed opened the session of the Re
pttbUcan Congressional Committee of
the Third District to-day. The meeting
waa held in the courtroom of Justice
of the Peace Quinn. and with a pile of
l*>fipl books and dockets in front of him
Mr. Heed decided that this would be
about the proper introduction. The
spirit of the Joke was caught up by the
iomrr.it tee. and the members got right
cow n to work as if it was play.

E. B. Willis, for many years man
aging editor of the Sacramento Rec
ord-Union and until recently secretary
of the California commission to the
St. Louis Exposition, has purchased
the Placer County Republican, of
which he assumed control last Tues
day. Mr. Willis is among: the best
known newspaper men of Northern
California, where, as the managing
editor of the Sacramento Record-
Union for sixteen years, he figured
prominently in all public movements
toward the betterment of that section
of the State, and in taking up his new
enterprise he purposes to follow the
same course that has made him one
of California's recognized citizens. He
departed for Auburn last evening and
before taking his leave he made this
statement regarding the future policy
of the Republican:
It is not my r>un>cse at this time to go Into
details as to the future policy of my paper,
but I may say that the leading aim and object
of its Dub'icatlon will be the development and
exploitation of Northern California and espe
cially Auburn and Placer County. This paper
will combat the Idea, which has become so
fixed in the minds of Eastern people, that Los
Angeles is about all there Is In California It
will fight to a finish the claim of Southern
California to one-half of the State offices. -Th*
Idea that the seven counties south of Tehacnipl
should be conceded cne United States Senator
and more than half the Governors against the
other fifty counties of the State is supremely
ridiculous. The vigorous assertion of the
Southern California demand has for many years
won thÂ« day. and the people of Northern Cali
fornia have tamely submitted. This state of
affairs shall not continue If the Republican
can arouse the people of this end of the State
to demand and secure a fair and proper share
of political representation.

Weaver were continually under the in
fluence of liquor, according to the tes
timony of the witnesses.
On Thursday night George â¢ and
Clara, two of \ the children, were
found sleeping in Union Square. The
mother was found with Weaver, her
son Thomas and little Virginia in a
room at 45 Stockton street. The child
was almost dead from hunger.
Weaver, whp appeared in Judge
Conlan's court,' was sentenced to five
months for vagrancy. The mother
; was convicted in Judge Mogan's court
and will be sentenced to-day. The
case of the eldest , son, Thomas, will
: be taken up to-day in the" same court.
â¢ May Stewart,- once known "as "Dia
mond. May," was convicted of vag
rancy .in) Judge Mogan's court. At
one time the woman had hosts of ad
mirers, her smiles causedvthe down
fall of many and her word was law
along the tenderloin.
â¢ Among her : slaves were men who
have since become famous.. Her
sobriquet, "Diamond May," was given
her because of : the thousands of dol
lars' worth of jewelry showered upon
herjby men who were dazzled by her
beauty. Â¦ : ;
Â¦ The fallen queen of the tenderloin,
who at one time would have disdained
to'gorinto the street except in a car
riage, was. arrested Thursday at the
corner of Third and Mission streets, a
common vagrant. As' she sfood before
Judge Mogan yesterday there were
few- traces left of the beauty that
drove -men mad. Her day was past.
She seemed no different from the
wrecks of - womanhood that drift In
and "out of the police courts dally.
She wlllbe sentenced to-day. . - \
John Molloy, a "cullud pusson,"
looked like a chocolate cream that
had' been run over by a dray -when he
was carried into Judge Mogan's court.
Part 'of J him was bandage, the rest
was groans.
â¢ "I was making an arrest at Jackson
and Stockton," explained Policeman
George Douglass. "The negro butted
In.-M remonstrated with him."
V'T^. guess you remonstrated pretty
thoroughly," remarked his Honor
critically.,
â¢ "Yes.'sah," groaned Molloy. "He
,'monstrated first at the top of. the
stairs andvkept 'monstrating all the
way down,' sah. - He Just done 'mon
strated mah whole head off and then
'monstrated me in the shin, sah, and
put me- out. He can 'monstrate
harder than Joe Gans."
Molloy was charged with vagrancy
and resisting an officer. His case was
continued. *
Policeman Douglass entered the
house conducted by the negro on
Thursday night to rescue a white girl.
17 years of age. Molloy says she was
left in his wife's charge by her
mother.
When Judge Mogan saw the girl,
who Is known as Maggie O'Brien, he
refused to let her go back to the ne
gro's place. The creature appears to
be weak minded. She will, probably
be sent to a public institution. Po
liceman Douglass says the negroes a*e
opium fiends.
F. J.; Brown, r a civil engineer, who
was before Judge 'Cabanlss for carry
ing a concealed weapon, pleaded trav
eler's privilege to, go heeled.
"While you are in this port." said
his Honor sternly, "you must disman

Uncle Sam himself." Brown prom
ised to spike his guns and was per
mitted to -go free.

It is common talk In political campi
that Judges Troutt, Kerrigan and D. W.
Burchard will be nominated by the Re
publicans for the Superior bench. A
strong effort may be made to nominate
McClellan, but he has incurred the dis
pleasure of Thomas D. Riordan to such
a degree that Republican leaders have
been personally Importuned to exclude
McClellan from consideration. James
A. Gallagher, a prominent Native Son,
may be placed on the Republican
slate.
It Is common gossip that Gavin Mac-
Nab will give the Democratic judicial
nominations to Judges Seawell and
Murasky, William White and Living
ston Jenks. There is Inside Intelli
gence to the effect that Troutt, Burch
ard, Murasky and White are slated for
the Indorsement of the Union 'Labor

bracing the counties of Monterey, â¢ San

support of Senator Thomas Flint: All
reports to the effect that the latter is
Indifferent and lukewarm ; are without
foundation. Flint Is i open and out
spoken for Lynch at all places and at

Senator, Joseph M. Plunkett, is a
Democrat.
The Republican local nominating
convention will organize at Pioneer
Hall on September 26. The Democratic
local convetlon will meet next Tuesday
evening.
The Republican convention of the
Fourth Congressional District will meet
in Pioneer Hall on Thursday evening,
September 22. The prospects of Repub
lican victory in the district are re
markably bright. All that is needed to
assure the success of the party is the
nomination of a capable Republican of
good character. The people of the dis
trict know what is going on in the
Democratic and Union Labor camps
and are eager for the opportunity of
voting for some man to repre
sent the district in Congress who Ms
not tied up to Herrin, Hearst, Ruef,
Schmitz or McNab. Among the avail
able Republicans mentioned for the
Â¦ innor of leading the party in the dis
trict are J. C. Wilson, George Stone,
William H. Davis Julius Kahn, A. D.
Porter and George Boyne.
SUPERIOR JUDGES.
At the outset Democratic managers
in the East resolved to make. President
Roosevelt's "dangerous personality"
the battle cry of the campaign, but
later on they resolved to switch and
make the "safety" of Parker the key
note. Bell got the first cue all right
and fired at the President point blank,
but ceased firing immediately on re
ceiving, the supplemental. cue. The Re-'
publican papers of- the district, how
ever, will not allow Bell to change
front, but insist that the Democratic
nominee shall -tell the voters what he
had in mind when he referred to the
dangerous characteristics of President
Roosevelt. Old campaigners say that
Bell's mistake in attacking the Presi
dent renders McKinlay's election cer
tain: *
The Union Labor party convention,
J. N. Copus chairman, will hold an
other session next Tuesday evening.
Candidates for the Legislature and Su
perior bench will be nominated. The
Fourth Congressional District Conven
tion of the party will also meet on
that evening. The programme to in
dorse the candidacy of E. J. Livernash
Is unchanged. The Democratic dis
trict convention of the Fourth, which
met at Santa Cruz and nominated
Livernash, was not attended by more
than a dozen delegates. In fact there
were no representatives to boast of at
any of the district conventions of the
Democratic party at Santa Cruz. The
Sixth District Convention nominated
thirteen delegates and the whole un
lucky number voted in favor of Judge
Conley. In the Second District Con
vention, which was held in the ladies'
parlor of the St. George Hotel, the
Important county of Marin was not
represented at all. The only remark
that created any sort of enthusiasm in
the Second District Convention was
Bell's allusion to the dangerous per
sonality of President Roosevelt. ,
FOURTH DISTRICT.
The danger of light registration for
the- Presidential election is vanishing.
The number of voters registered in
San Francisco up to D o'clock last
evening was 67,800. The enrollment
from this time until the close of the
registration on September 28 will ex-.
ceed 1000 a day. There will probably
be a great rush % of applicants during
the forty-eight hours ' immediately
preceding midnight of the closing day.
A total registration of 86,000 is not
unlikely, and the vote of this city on
November H may approximate 75,000.
At the Presidential election of 1900
the total vote of San Francisco was
62.917. There are predictions in the
Republican camp that this city will
give a greater majority for Roosevelt
on November 8 than it gave four years
ago for McKinley. If the Republican
hosts of Los Angeles fall to roll up a
tremendous majority for Roosevelt
San Francisco will again capture the
banner.
Much of the present activity In reg
istration is due to the energetic and
methodical work of the Republican
committees. As a general rule heavy
registration signifies Republican suc
cess. - â¢
Gossip Concerning Conven
tion Elates of the Several
Political Parties of City
The troubles of the Edwards family,
recent arrivals from Cincinnati, Ohio,
were aired in two Police courts. It Is
a sordid low-life story.
Mrs. Clara, Edwards, the mother,
shortly after her arrival in this city,
became enamored^ of Byron Weaver,
a young man of unsavory reputation.
She Inherits an Income of several hun
dred dollarn a month from an estate
in Cincinnati.
When the remittance arrived on
May 17 . she left .her husband, taking
her four childrenâ -Thomas, aged 18;
George, aged 14; Clara, aged 11, and
Virginia, aged 7.
Accompanied by the children she
went on a prolonged spree with
Weaver. During this debauch the
younger children suffered terribly
from neglect. ! The strange' party
visited Petaluma and several other
country towns while the money held
out. During this time the woman and
Gillespie made a flank movement
toward the music box. Mrs. McAdoo
seized a beer bottle and stood guard.
"Sailor beware," warned the phono
graph, "danger is near thee; so be
ware! beware!" Gillespie took the
hunch and descended Twin Peaks in
record time, but was arrested on com
plaint of Mrs. McAdoo. The case w-as
continued to September 23.
John Gillespie appeared, before
Judge Mogan yesterday, charged with
disturbing the white-winged doves of
peace that roost continually over the
bar and grocery conducted by Mar
garet McAdoo at 1420 Castro street.
Margaret bought a phonograph
some time ago from the firm of which
Gillespie is collector. That phono
graph was the pride of the region. It
furnished dance music at the simple
fiestas given by the cliff dwellers of
Twin Peaks and mothers used to bring
their babies to the store to be rocked
to sleep by its soffstralns.
On Thursday Gillespie. appeared at
the grocery, alleging that $2 25 was
due on the music machine. Indig
nantly Mrs. McAdptp. denied that It was
"true. Meanwhile, the" machine struck
up: "I Owe $10 to O'Grady."
Gillespie argued and Mrs. McAdoo
flourished what she said was a receipt
In his face. "I guess that will hold
you for a while," piped the phono
graph.
"It is pleasant when not 'taken too

Large expenditures are Involved In
the operations of the Old Dominion
property at Globe, Arizona. Up to date,
according to current reports, the out
lay has amounted to more than $700,
000. The total estimated cost of the
new work is $900,000. All the under
ground work is to be changed. A new
smelter Is nearly completed. The old
6melter was torn down to give room
for something more modern. By the
underground changes It is hoped to af
fect a monthly gavinp of fully $10,000.
The United Verde mine, at Jerome,
Is Increasing its product. Many Im
provements have been made in the
mine, including the re-equipment of the
main shaft, by which added hoisting
facilities are secured. Two furnaces of
250 tons each have been replaced at the
smelter by furnaces of the capacity of
BOO tons each. A third furnace of thÂ«
came size will be added.

Several facts are reported by the
Placerville Nugget regarding the min
ing industry in El Dorado County. The
Monte Mining and Milling Company
has purchased a ten-stamp mill, to be
installed on the Monte mine in the Gold
Hill district. A smaller mill Is now
operating. The shaft at the Ida Mitch
ell mine, near Placerville, Is down
nearly to the 400-foot level. A road
has been completed to the Rescue mines
and the shaft at the Rescue is down
sixty feet.
EL DORADO COUNTY.
It is not expected that the real work of pro
ducing copper will commence before spring, as
r.-.uch preparatory .work has to be done. The
reduction of the copper will be by a new pro-
Mm: the or*, after going through the mill, will

emelter. Oil enters largely Into this new pro
cess of concentration, and it is said that ar
ranÂ£eniâ¬-nts have been made to put ten-horse
trajim on the read to Milton to haul the oil re
quired In the work. The people who now own
the mines and are preparing to open them
have plenty of capital. They have beejj quiet
ly at work for a number of years securing title
to extensive tracts of mineral land, till now
they oÂ«n a vast extent.
The Mountain Echo says that there
are more than 1000 men employed in
the mines at Angels Camp and that
the monthly wage payments amount to
more than $75,000. The belief is enter
tained that within two years the num
ber of employes will be doubled. Large
properties are to be opened. "Eastern
capital," says the Echo, "is being di
rected this way and as soon as some
of the lodes along the south belt,
through Albany Flat to Carsons, are
taken in hand by men of means a gen
uine revival of business and enterprise
will follow." Operations have been re
sumed at the Salvator mine in Cala
veras Ccrunty, ivhich has been idle for
some months. The mine contains ore
of low grade in large quantities.
The Mother LÂ«ode Banner says that a
strike in the New Albany mine has led
to encouraged mining on the East Belt.
The New Albany mine is near Carters.
The same journal says that the lease
for the Mount Lily group of six claims
runs for five years and that the lessee
agrees to pay one-third of the pro
ceeds under conditions. The lease is
from Jacob Schoenfeld and. David Ad
ler to Charles Grim.
Concerning the proposed revival of
operations at Copperopolis the Cala
veras Prospect says:
RÂ«pons that come from CoFperopolis indicate
that the town is likely to resume Its old time
Importance in the near future. The owners of
the extensive copper mines there are busily at
viwk getting things in readiness for opening
the mints on a large scale. A kiln of OOO.O'-K)
bricks is being prepared, and largÂ£ <juantKlet
of cement and other supplie* are being hauled
to the plact. Quite a force of men is already
employed, rhich doubtless will be Increased to
imi men before long.
Recent deals in mining properties in
this Stale have been heavy. Among
these tr.ay be mentioned, as possessing
p&blic interest, the reported sale of the
Laudecker gravel mine In El Dorado
County, for $250,000, to D. H. Jackson
and others; the bonding of the Reid
mines, and the group of mines owned
by the Joshua Ilenuy esiate, in Shasta
County; the sir^l-cr deal for the Par
r.ell mine in Calavcras County, near
Anpely, which property has been bond
ed io M. Voinich; the bonding of the
Eijstern Hlar mine in Placer County to
Â«n Kastern company; the bonding to
the Shasta National Consolidated Min
ing Company of eight mining claims in
Shasta County; the sale to the Crater
Alining Company of nine claims in
fciskiyou County, near the Dewey mine,
and the sale of the Drinkwater gravel
claim of 100 acres in Trinity County ti/
the Drinkwater Mining Company.
ThesÂ«j widely separated deals, geo
graphically considered, axe sufficient to
show that the interest in California
mining properties is well sustained.
According to the Tuolumne Inde
pendent an English company will oper
ate the Golden Gate and Gerrymander
mine and will begin work on a larg*
scale in November. Plans axe about

Stanislaus River near Knights Ferry.
A strip of land five miles long has been
bonded for dredging. A steam pros
pecting plant will test the value of the
travel.
The ehaft of the Argonaut mine in
Amador County will be extended until
it reaches a depth of 2509 feet. Sinking
is progressing satisfactorily. The shaft
at the Burlington mine is reported to
be down 75 feet. Twenty-five men are
employed by the Wildman company,
hoists are kept busy in unwatering ana
in the work of repairing and getting
ready to resume.
The Sonora Union Democrat reports
that the Jumper and Golden Rule
ir.ines in Tuolumne County are devel
oping extensively, preparatory to large
operations when the heavy rains come.
The Jumper mill is dropping thirty
stamps, night and day.
FUTURE OF COPPEROPOLIS.
Drift mining In the southern part of the
county has been an Important Industry since
the early fifties. The so called blue lead
extends through th? county parallel to the
main range of the Sierras and at right an
gles to the present streams. The channel was
discovered In 1852 near Minnesota. This body
of gravel is capped with several hundred feet
of volcanic debris. . The paying portion Is
about 300 feet wide and from one to three
feet deep, lying on or near the bedrock.
H. L. Johnson, the bonder of the Tlghtner
mine, reports a mill return of $3100 from a
mill run on 1000 pounds of specimen ore taken
from the large shoot recently opened up. The
ehoot hss been followed 75 feet and averages
15 feet in width. The rich rock is found
as a ribboned quartz within 2 feet of the
eerpentlne hanging wall. The foot wall Is
schist. It is planned to start a 1000-foot
drift to intersect this and other known shoots
at a lower level. A ten-statap mill will prob
ably be put in near the mouth of the tun
nel.
series relating to the mineral resources
of California. Two field assistants are
engaged in collecting the necessary
data for a bulletin to contain all that
can be learned about the industrial and
structural materials of California that
are taken out by mining processes. The
bulletin relative to these materials will
be issued and ready for distribution in
March. The work of the field assistants
in this direction has been about com
pleted in the southern counties of th*
State. Attention will next be paid
especially to the northern and central
sections of the State, where some work
has been already performed. In addi
tion to this bulletin one on the gems of
California will be published. The Cali
fornia gem field is mainly in San Diego
County, where gems of several kinds
have been discovered in merchantable
quantities. A display of .California
gems was one of the features of the
California mineral exhibit at the St.
Louis Exposition.
Concerning recent mining develop
ments in Sierra County a correspond
ent of the Mining and Scientific Press
writes:
At prevent this county ii the home of the
prospector and email miner. Every canyon and
fjlch li belr.e staked with claims, many of
which are belnr worked by three and four
men. In the aggrccate these small mines In
volve aa much labor and capital as do the few
larjje mine* in the more southern mining coun
ties of the State. Occasionally theee claims
have developed Into large properties, -employ
ing; many men and producing handsomely. But
tt may be safely stated that, as a nils. Sierra
is essentially the county of the prospector.
In a trip extending; through the width of the
county west of the summit of the Sierras many
of these mines were visited, and a description
of the conditions throughout the â¢ county will
undoubtedly prove of Interest, not only as a
mere description of the county, but also as a
statement of the commercial needs of the min
ers, for each mine is continually installing
machinery. The county will be described by
towns from south to north.
At Pike City the Alaska mine has been
bought for $10,000 and on August 8 men were
unwaterlng the shaft, preparatory to further
development. This mine has been worked
Intermittently by different companies since
1S56. an eiÂ£ht-stamp mill having been put
up In 1SSS. During this time over Sl.000,000
has bean taken out, mostly from the sur
face. The present intention is to test the
value with Increase in depth. The present
shaft has been sunk 462 feet vertical and will
be continued. A twenty-stamp mill Is on the
property, the forty-stamp mill having: been
burned. The company Is hauling In electri
cal machinery and an air compressor from
above Oroville. George St. Johns has charge
of the property. The development of this mine
will materially aid Pike City.
Thirty men are at work at the Plumbago
mine, bplow Aileghany. This quartz property
has been steadily producing for a number of
years. The tunnel Is in nearly 1300 feet. The
mine Is equipped with a "twenty-stamp mill,
also a power plant generating electricity for
the Plumbago and the Oriental.
At Alleshany the tunnel of the Oriental
mine has been driven in 3650 feet and a branch
of the main quartz ledge has been struck.
The vein occurs In dlorite and has been par
tially developed by a 1000-foot shaft. H. L.
Johnson is superintendent in charge. M. W.
Mather is manager.

BERKELEY.Sept. 16.â It is a little
too early to prognosticate who will
help defend the University of Califor
nia colors in football this, year.; , As
far as material is concerned^ that for
the varsity is almost as raw as that
for the freshman team. Even the
coaches are a long way' from knowing
how th^ varsity will line up. At this
stage of the game it would be" folly
"tfi even hazard a guess at the personr
nel of the team. From the way 1 af r
fairs look a team will; not" be; selected,
until Just before the big intercollegiate
game. It will take all of these two
and a half months to .develop" the
proper material. â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦ ,' / ; v Â¦Â¦)
The football squad does "not seem to
contain | any such uniformly . big men
as played on -last year's varsity.' Â¦ The
big fellows, have all gone! There" are
no . Overalls nor Stows for '. guard, . nor
Iludsons and DemerrlttB for ends. Thi
material Is rather light, take : it all in
all. Coach Hopper promises -tot make
the best out of what is available... The
way, he goes at the coaching business
, in a revelation, to the veterans. r-There
i3 no doubthe sees the. only salvation
for California this year. is a fast. team
and all his teaching so far has. been
in that . direction. Hopper is ! already
being assisted in hl3'work by Mini,' last
year's varsity halfback, and, is likely
soon to .have Geisberg, .jwith .whpm
negotiations are pending. ..,/â.;.
" There are five places on the varsity
that will have to be filled; with- new

. STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 16.
The work of two weeks' hard training
under the direction' of Coach -Lanagan
has had its effect on the cardinal foot
ball squad and a fast organization is
being rapidly perfected. With the
nine veteran players who were left
trom . last year a team Coach Lanagan
had the nucleus of an eleven which
was able to start at once learning
new plays and did npt have to waste
three or four weeks learning the
rudiriients of the game. Consequently
the progress has been rapid and the
coaches are satisfied with the outlook.
There: are to be two qualifications
this year which every man who hopes
to. make the Stanford team must have.
These, are weight and speed. Coach
Lanagan' feels that both the University
of California -and the Stanford teams
will be . .stronger I than those of Â¦ last
year and he is looking forward
to a. union of weight and speed that
will develop" a team capable either of
plunging through a heavy line, or
skirting the .opponent's ends at top
speed. To accent -this speed a new
way of passing the ball from center to
quarterback is being tried. .The.cen
ter snaps the - ball into the quarter's
hands instead of , his arms, as hereto
fore. .This- enables the quarter to pass
the , ball to the backs easier and more
quickly. The tendency in. this method
Is : more frequent fumbling, but with
quarterbacks, as- sure as.Stott and
Bansbach there is little danger of
this.* ..-,Â¦. . __...Â»., ,
. There are nine veterans playing on
the field eleven now- and they seem a
tower of strength. Captain Clark will
be at left end. Roosevelt at either left
guard or tackle, Thompson , at right
guard, Shields right tackle and Smith
right end form a strong, heavy line
with but two vacancies to be filled.
Bansbach will be a quarter again and
will give the , signals. Stott . is here to
take. Bansbach 's x>lace in case the.lat
ter ; is hurt. Dole, Weller and Chal
mers .co'molete a back field that ; will
average ,175 pounds to the man. T i,:
vlt-is far too early in the season â¢ to
say, these veterans : will all get into the
game, v ; Some ; may be '- injured ? in - , the
preliminary-games and again some
of them, may dose 1 their." positions to
better men, but -their, presence in the
game makes the outlook for ; success
and" victory far from- discouraging.
, There -are < several husky - freshmen
who -are going; to make, a hard fight
for; the .varsity before the -'.season Is
over. : r Tomaslnl is' one of them; 'He
is a : tackle f from the Palo Alto High
school, weighs 200 : pounds and' punt*

will be a strong favorite for first
honors. Percy Mur.dock, Will;. Allen;
R.' N. Whitney. George Baker. Clar*
ence Griffin and many of the Califor
nia Club cracks will also , participate.
The lady playertr of the park will
hold a class singles tournament to-day.
There is no first class at the; park
among the lady players and play will
be confined to second and third class
players. In the second, class Miss
Anna.Vodden. is the champion.' Miss
Travenar won .the third class", in '..th<Â»

The first annual tournament for the
championship of the bay counties will
be inaugurated at the park on the
23th inst. A cup has been donated by
Reuben H. Lloyd, to be competed for
until won three times.
While the players from the south
failed in the men's events, they cer
tainly carried off the honorB ; in the
events for women. The Sutton sisters,
as usual, swept all before them and it
in safe to say they will be champions
as long as they play the game. May
Sutton Is lit a class by herself and
could give odds to any other^ woman
player in the country.
The completion of the. coast cham
pionship tennis tournament at Kan
Rafael on Monday brought to a close
one of the most successful .meets held
in years. The number of entries great
ly exceeded that of any previous year
and there was no lack of class. Fifty
one players entered the men's singles.
At a rule about twenty-five players en
ter the tournament and the fact that
there were twice this number in the
competition shows how popular the
game of tennis is at present. This in
crease is due to a great extent to tne
introduction of the game at the park.
This -gave the general public an'oppor
tunity both to see and to play the
game. The hundreds of spectators
and players at the park oach Sunday
disprove the old saying that tennis, is
a ladies* game. . â¢ =â¢
Since 1901, when George Whitney
v:as forced to retire, the champion
ship in both men's singles and doubles
has gone to players from Southern
California. - For two years Bell â¢ and
Freeman divided the honors between
them, but this year both titles have
again come north. J. Drummond Mac-
Gavin has at last developed into a. star
and is the premier racket wielder of
the coast. In July he won the State
championship and by beating Bell on
Monday he proved beyond a doubt
that he is the. best tennis player' in the
\Vest.Â» True, Bell was at a slight dis
advantage in the challenge match, but
the consensus of opinion is that Mac-
Gavin would have won under any and
all circumstances,

A grand Ftand accommodating 400
persons .will enable spectators to see
the start, the finish and the cars pass
ing at full speed. The cars will prob
ably be started at Intervals of three
minutes. There will be two controls,
which will take nine minutes to pass
through. The order of starting will be
decided by a drawing at the house of
the Automobile Club of America on
Saturday. October 1. Each competitor's
number will show the exact time at
which he will be started. It is said the
people who live near the course are
favorably disposed toward the race, but
for the sak<Â» of avoiding any possible
disagreements the racing board an
nounces that any intending competitor
who rxceeds the legal rate of speed
over tWcobrbe will be at once disqual
ified.
The course is ten times around a cir
cuit of Z" l ~t miles, or a total distance of
Z2S miles, and lies chiefly In the county
of Nassau and partly in Queens Coun
ty, New York. It has long stretches. of
Rood road, with few heavy grades,
rharp turns or crossings of railroad or
electric car tracks. It will be closed to
general travel from 5 a. ni. to 3 p. m.
on the day of the race.
Great care will be taken to guard
against accidents to competitors or
spectators, about 125 men being em
ployed on police duty at crossroads and
other places. Notices informing the
public about the race are being printed
in the nrusnaprfp. and other steps are
being taken to warn people of the tem
porary 'use of the road by the racing
cars.
Up to the Cth inst only four Ameri
can cars had been entered. Two of
these are White steam racers, the other
two being a Royal tourist and a Pope
Toledo. The White machines will be
driven by Rollin T. White and Webb
Jay. They have been built especially
for the race, but the details of their
construction have been concealed so
carefully that their horsepower is not
known.
The Royal Tourist is the car which
was driven by Aseph Tracy at the
Long Branch meet, where it won sev
eral events. It is a touring car, stripped
and equipped with a racing body and
geared to a maximum of about sev
enty-five miles an hour. The Pope
Toledo car. to be driven by A. C. Webb,
is of sixty horsepower. It was expect
ed that the Packard "Gray Wolf," a
Smith & Mabley simplex and other
American cars would be entered before
the list closed.
The race for the cup" offered by W.
K. Vanderbilt Jr. promises to be an in
teresting event. Though the entries
have come in slowly, enough have been
made to insure good racing. There will
be three 90-horsepower Panhards, one
of them driven by Heath, the Ameri
can operator who drove the victorious
Panhard car in the Circuit des Arden*
lies in Belgium. There will be three
60-horsepower Mercedes cars, one of
them driven by S. B. Stevens of Rome,
N. Y., its owner. The owners of the
other two cars are George Arrents and
Clarence Gray Dlnsmore. Two - 90
horsepower F. I. A. T. cars, one owned
by Willi im Wallace of Boston and the
other by Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt,
are also entered. From the Automobile
Club of France comes the entry of an
80-horsepower Clement- Bayard car of
curious build. It has a long hood ex-
Tending from the radiator, of small
dimensions in front, but much wider
and higher at the back where the op
erator sits ever the rear axle. It took
third position in the Circuit des Arden
nes, one of the most Important Euro
pean auto events. It will be driven by
A. Clement, son of its manufacturer,
a young man of 21 years who is said to
be extremely daring and ready to take
any chances. As he was beaten in the
Belgian event by Heath by the narrow
margin of four minutes, he is anxious
to turn the tables.
It was believed that a circular defi
nitely setting a date for the Joint en
durance run of the Automobile Clubs
of California and Southern California
would have been issued before this,
but the invasion of the Knights Tem
plar disturbed all arrangements. L. P.
Lowe, the chairman of the racing com
mittee of the Automobile Club of Cali
fornia, in whose hands rest the prep
aration and distribution of the circu
lar, has decided to defer action until
the convention of* Odd Fellows has
come and gone.
The fastest actual sailing time over
the fourteen-mile course was made by
Fulton Berry's sloop Nixie, being
2:34:17. T. Jennings' sloop Speedwell
made the second best time, 2:33:32, and
Harpoon covered the course In 2:41:2S.
On time allowance W. O. Morrow's
sloop Challenger beat the whole fleet,
covering the course in 2:41:54 actual
time, in spite of the loss of some min
utes on account of the absence of the
windward stakeboat on the second beat
out. ;':-'
Though the important annual regat
tas are over, each of the three clubs
will hold a regatta before the end of
the present season. On Sunday, Octo
ber 9, the San Francisco Yacht Club
will hold a power-boat race, and the
Corinthian Yacht Club will have it*
regular small boat races off Paradise
Cove. The handicap regatta for the
Vincent cup will be held by the Califor
nia Yacht Club on Sunday, October 2.
The South Bay Yacht Club fleet
cruises to-morrow to Dumbarton
bridge, starting from Its moorings in
Alviso Slough at 9:45 o'clock in the
morning. The clambake and barbecue
recently given by the South Bays to the
visiting Corinthian yachtsmen were
highly successful. The visiting fleet in
cluded Commodore T. Jennings* sloop
Speedwell; the sloops Edna, Neptune,
Espey, Aloha and Aeolus; the yawl
Frolic and the California sloop Pacto
lus. This was the first time that any
considerable number of San Francisco
yacht* had been anchored at Alviso,
and the hospitable reception of the vis
iting tars was highly appreciated.
The regatta committee of the Pacific
Interclub Yaeht Association has con
firmed the results of the races held aa
Admission day. A protest was offered
by Kennedy and Burke, owners of tha
little yawl Witch, which sailed around
the course allotted for the special yawl
class,' though she had been included
with the little yawl Kittiwake in the
twenty-foot class, or "mosquito fleet."
It has been the practice of the regatta
committee to assign small yawls to the
twenty- foot j special class, giving them
the regular 10 per cent allowance for
rig. The committee has this power and
saw no reason for departing from Its
usual course. The starting and finish
ing times of the yawl Witch were not
taken by the judges,, who did not know
on the day of the regatta that, her own
ers were racing. Mf5
This will be "members' night" at the
quarters of the San â¢ Francisco â¢ Yacht
Club - In Sausalito. The billiard arid
card tournaments, which were to have
been held on Saturday, the 3d inst.,
but' were postponed on account of the
absence of several members during the
Labor day vacation, will be held to
night- The night's amusements will in
clude not only billiards, but. also chess,
checkers, dominoes, euchre and whist.
Members only are to be present. The
evening's games will begin at 8:15
o'clock, and refreshments will ..be,
served. The winners will receive
prizes.
The fleet of the Corinthian Xacht
Club will cruise to-night to Vallejo, the
tide, which floods until 5:40 p. m. at
Fort Point and some , hours later In
Mare Island Straits, being favorable
for a run up the bay. The fleet will re
turn to moorings at Tlburon to-mor
row.
Most of thr yachtsmen of the San
Francisco Club will content themselves
with starting to-morrow morning for a
few hours' cruise. The California Club
has no event set down on Its pro
gramme. On Saturday, the 24th inst.,
the San Francisco fleet will cruise to
Vallejo, and on the following day will
race down to Sausalito. .

Wonderful, improvement is shown

their appreciation of this fact by the
way they turned out last night. Every

Immigration officials have reason to
suspect that as well as attempting* to
force . the border by the land eroute
Chinese are being sent north by sea in
small' boats to be landed at various
points along the coast. The Manning
is to keep a lookout for this sort" of
smuggling.
. How difficult a proposition It is to
guard against the illegal entry of Chi

the recently captured band of eleven
got across at a point forty miles from
an inspector's station.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 16. â A spe
cial election of unusual Interest was
held in the Third Ward to-day for thÂ«
purpose of choosing a Councilman to
succeed J. P. Davenport, recently re
moved by the "recall" feature of the
city charter. The candidates were
Dr. A. D. Houghton. supported by the
Good Government League, and J. P.
Davenport, who sought to succeed
himself. Houghton won a decided vic
tory- . - -
The recall - provision - of the charter
is an Innovation In municipal govern
ment and the result of to-day's elec
tion was watched with great Interest.
The provision gives the constituents
of any Councilman who . has acted
contrary to their interests power to
"recall" him upon the presentation of
a petition to the City Clerk havinjr th*
signatures of 60 per cent of the.bona
fide voters of the ward. The Council
must then order a special election.
An unknown man was found by
Policeman Joy In an unconscious con
dition last night at 8:30 o'clock in
front of the saloon of John Kelly at
615 Pacific street. The stranger had
evidently taken carbolic acid.. When
found by the officer he was unable to
speak. He was hurried to the Har
bor Hospital, where he died fifteen
minutes later. A- broken phial that
had contained carbolic acid was found
in the toilet of the saloon. ?

A few years ago Lukens. who is a
wealthy man, actuated solely by love
of this section, planted a large area of
the mountains in seed of the Pinus
tuberculata, but the" ensuing year was
bo. dry that although a large propor
tion of the seed sprouted, the witner
ing heat of the summer killed it.
Since then Lukens has established a
nursery on Mount Wilson and there he
has ' many thousand pine trees rrom
one to two years old. These are to
be transplanted' to the mountains' of
this section and it is expected that if
there is a medium rainfall this winter
they will do well.
SAN BERNARDINO. Sept. 16. â T.
P. Luken of Pasadena, aided by the
Federal Government, has undertaken
the task of replanting with trees the

men.

AMERICAN LEAGUE.
The pitching of both Newton and
Schmidt was marvelous. The batsmen
en both Eldes were utterly helpless be
fore their curves and speed and up to
the fatal tenth all the fielders were
"working almost perfectly. Newton
fanned nine men and Schmidt five.
Oakland got only two hits, one In the
third and one in the fourth.
Schmidt completed thirty-two con
necutive innings without allowing a run
to score on him after he had retired
the last ruan m the ninth. The game
Â¦would unquestionably have been called
on account of darkness had not the
Commuters taken their aerial flight in
the tenth spasm. The score:

Oaklir.d displayed the yellow streak
yesterday at Recreation Park before
Schmidt had a chance to achieve one
of the most brilliant victories of the
year on this diamond. After the game
little German had run neck and neck
v ::b the redoubtable Newton for nine
Innings, the Commuters Quit like a lot
cf milksops in the tenth and let the
Angels set three runs. Thus an ideal
game was broken up. Score, Los An
geles 3, Oakland 0.
The most enthusiastic Angel rooters
admitted it was a chame. Even after
the bases were filled In the tenth
through bad baseball and no one was
out. Schmidt never for a moment let
up. He was working as hard and as
laithfullv then as he v.as in the first
round, but he could not possibly win.
Every fan on the lot lingered when
the Angels went to bat in the tenth.
Newton, the first man up, slapped the
simplest kind of a hit to Devereaux.
He had all the time in the world, yet
he tossed the ball away at first base.
Bernard followed with a pop to second-
Nu one got even near the ball. New
ton could easily have been headed off
at second, yet no one tried to stop
him.
Thin Flood bunted to Schmidt and in
a twinkling: he threw the ball to Dever
eaux. The latter dropped the sphere
like a hot potato and the fans groaned.
Smith swung through with, a single to
center and Dunleavy allow'ed the ball
to go through him. ecoring Newton and
Bernard. Cravath drove out a long fly
and the Â»ast run came in.
* Luck played against the Commuters
in the ninth when they all but had
the game. Schmidt opened it with a
fly to the flag-pole which Ross dropped
alter getting richt under it. Francks
pent the jrame little slabster to third.
Ganley produced a fly to right field.
Cravath lined it perfectly to the pan,
nailing Schmidt by ten feet and spoil
ing the only chance Oakland had to
ecore a run.

READVILLE, Mass., Sept. 16.â
Major Delmar failed by three-quarters
of a second. to break the unpaced trot
ting record to-day, at the Readville
track, principally by reason of a heavy
track,- When the '" son of Delmar
reached the three-quarter pole- In l:30*i
it seemed the record would go, but the
track and * breeze proved too much of
a drag. The fractional time was:
:30%,-1:00?Â«M:~30%. 2:02%.'
John Caldwell. owned by J. C. Klrk
patrick of San Francisco, won the $1000
2:16-class trot cleverly. He outclassed
his field in the first two heats, which
he won in 2:12% and 2:14. He broke
at 'the -start of the third heat, losing
100 yards, and finishing last in 2:14. He
jogged, home -in the fourth heat, win
ning easily In 2:13ti. -Summary:
Britt stated later that he would meet
Gans after his go with Corbett. Of
course, the date Is a long way off. but
as both men have signified their will
ingness It is likely they may face each
other some time within the next year.
Gans said he would post a forfeit and
stood ready to meet Britt at any time
the latter stipulates.
The fights were all of the kind that
make the fanatics yell. Big George
Sullivan gave Joe Long an awful maul-
Ing in the main go of the night and
won without effort. He- had Lons
groggy and all but gone in the last two
rounds, but could not bring over the
decisive wallop. Long kept rushing
most of the time, but Sullivan always
met his rushes squarely, using a sort
of overhand chop to good advantage.
Dick Hyland let Frank Walsh, cham
pion feather-weight of the north, stay
two rounds. . Then the local lad went
In and got his man. He sent in some
hard punches to the stomach, and
Walsh soon rank to the floor a beaten
man. Torn Sullivan, won from Young
Choynskl in a mix-up that was gory
and furious from the call of time. Sul
livan was the e'everer and jabbed his
man hard. He began to mix it in the
final round, and Choynski landed a
few right-hand swings, that nearly
brought home the money.
Joe Podfsta earned the decision over
George Ellis; Harry RIley finished
Billy McGrew in three roundsf Young
Dempsey got Jim Linegar in the same
round, and Tommy West took all the
fight out of Eddie Kehoe in the open
ing period.
FORFEITS TO BE POSTED.
Gans was as cool and collected a*
usual, and In a calm, ringing voicÂ«
said: "Gentlemen, I accept Mr. Britt't
challenge and I will post a forfeit at
any time. I will guarantee to makeÂ»
133 pounds ringside. I am anxious to
settle the lightweight supremacy and
let the public see who Is the real cham
pion "
As Gans was leaving the ring there
were shouts of "Britt! Britt!" Prompt
ly at the call of his namt the con
queror of Young Corbett climbed
blithely Into the ring. The crowd let
loose its reserve force of cheers as soon
as the champion, togged to the minute
and looking dapper and happy, posed in
the center of the ring.
Jimmy had a hard time beginning
his speech, so great was the cheering.
Finally he got settled down, and with
the grace of an orator and the gestures
of a tragedian said: "Gentlemen. Mr.
Gans refused to fight me when I chal
lenged him at 133 pounds before. Al
though I am averse to fighting colored
gentlemen. I will agree to meet Mr.
Gans at 123 pounds ringside."
As the cheers died away Gans again
made his appeanfnee at the ringside.
The house was In an uproar and It
seemed the colored vender would not
be able to make himself heard.. Quiet
finally prevailed, and â¢ cries of "Now
what will you do" and "Speech" rent
the air.
BRITT AS AN" ORATOR.
The little sideplay happened during
an intermission of the San Francisco
Club's show. Joe Walcott was rtally
the man who stands responsible for
the display of eloquence on the part of
the rival lightweights. Joseph entered
the ring and in his usual pleasant man
ner announced he was ready to do his
best when he hooked up with Gans.
Some time elapsed before Gans en
tered the ring. When he did appear
the crowd greeted him kindly, and it
was some time before' he could maka
himself heard. Finally he stepped into
the center of the ring and said: "Gen
tlemen, I came out here to fight light
weights, but when I discovered I had
been matched with Mr. Walcott I ac
cepted, and I promise you I will go in
to win."
Jimmy Britt' and Joe G&ns started
the hearts of SoOO boxing enthusiasts
fluttering hut nl*ht when they issued
bold challenges one to the other from
the ring at Woodward's Pavilion. Gans
opened the controversy by announcing
that he yearned to meet a flrst-class
lightweight. Britt took the dÂ«fl. and
again Gans came back and told those
present that everything was satisfac
tory to him.

Racegoers saw the new St.. Louis
Jockey, Willie Davis, successively ride
four winners to-day. On the way home
every one spent some time figuring out
with the modest "parlay" of 55 on this
rider's mounts would have yielded. His
mounts in the first and second jaces
were beaten, but he won the next four.
The "parlay" would have produced
516,000. The boy has not had six
months' experience as a Jockey.
It was the fourth race that brought
to the post whatever of class was en
gaged during the afternoon. Hurst
bourne was made favorite at 4 to 5.
Little Em made the running for about
seven furlongs, when Ostrich raced
past her on the outside and seemed to
have the race well in hand. Dekaber,
however, slowly overhauled him in the
stretch and got up Just in time to win.
Hurstboume was in a pocket for the
first five furlongs. In the last quarter
he came on the outside, and in the run
through ihe stretch lost ground. His
race attracted much critical attention.

Such a statement is born from a na
tural condition' of affairs. ..Without
passion for either side, the South
German has been won by very ad
miration for Japanese power. ' The
German newspapers ; are without edi
torials, but â¢ In the explanations and
enlargements of telegraphic news .the
columns' breathe* a calm ; but _ veryVdls
tlnct appreciation of the superiority of
Japanese arms. The French s papers
have taken a most perverted method
of editing Asiatic 'news.; ; : It is" a ; fair
copy of : the St.V Petersburg censored
dispatches, \whlch ; have excited .; the

papers. In the past few- weeks, even 1
In Prussia, has risen : a strong under
current : of '. criticism of Russia, The
BERLIN, Aug. 30. â Heralded by
Prussian press and devotedly encour
aged by the Russians, the spectacle of
a strong German friendship for the
Slav power has been world accepted
since the outbreak of the war. A
hard-headed, stubborn support* a will
ingness to tread carefully near the
limitations of international law, was
the reputed quality of German friend
ship. But certain curious statements
have crept into the German press In
the north, and even more curious ex
pressions from the semi-independent
German states of the south. The Ger
man friendship for the Slav is Prus
sian made. It is the child of the
he-use of Hohenzollern. Knowing this,
at once South Germany began to
show an independent Interest in the
conflict. Impossible of entire knowl
edge or sympathy with Prussian
schemes, Bavaria, TVurttemberg and
their neighbors watched with some
thing akin to satisfaction the repeated
defeat of a European rival in arms. A
Bavarian soldier Is drilled, paid and
in the service of Bavaria. If Germany
be attacked he is a German, but In
peace he is as much an Austrian as a
Prussian. Besides, Bavaria has a
yearly celebration, in which , she
mourns for 80,000 men who fell In a
war with Russia. A: large fraction of
Germany Is really without regret at
Togo's success, except in so far as he is
a friend of England. A strong, blind
hatred of England is one of the unify
ing elements in the German empire.
France is observed with careless dis
gust, but England has vigorous Ill
will from the Baltic to, the Alps. . Dur
ing the culmination of the siege ,of
Port Arthur- a young Bavarian officer
said: *"We admire .the Japanese! .How
could we help it? Also, how could. we
have the slightest respect for. the Rus
sian campaigns? Their lack of prepa
ration is the horror of. every officer in
Bavaria. Why should we ever tie our
cause to as rotten a hulk as the pres
ent Russian military organization?
You find small ."mourning .here over
Russian ill-success. ; And on the' other
hand we are driven- to a sincere ad
miration of the Japanese nation."

Russian Disasters
Lessen Friendship
of the Germans
1 Time was people could- be fooled by such tactics. Before
intercommunication was as easy as now a personal campaign was
easier and promised more success than now. The Whigs took
advantage of this in 1840. They inflamed the country against Van
Buren because his son John had danced with Queen Victoria, and
there was a set of gold spoons in the White House. These were
evidences that Van Buren was a monarchist and intended to over
throw liberty and . subjugate the people. It is laughable to look
back upon now, but one who will explore the campaign literature
of 1840 will be struck by the apparent earnestness and sincerity
with which such silly arguments were urged.
But it cannot be done now with any effect upon the voter. Mr.
Caminetti may try to appear better than his party by not abusing
the President, but he will have credit only for originality, since it
will be the first time in the political history of the State that a
candidate has sought votes by confessing that his party is too
indecent to follow or to imitate.
Mr. Caminetti's party relies entirely upon detraction of the
President. Senator Bailey opened the campaign with it in New
York, and Bourke Cockran has followed stiit in a speech filled with
insinuations against the President, and void of any discussion of
facts, principles and policies. That is an old game with Mr.
Cockran. He played it on Cleveland before his second nomination
and then confessed himself a traducer by supporting him., -In
1896 he took the stump against Bryan and denounced him. per
sonally. In 1900 he took the stump for Bryan and took it all
back and turned his batteries of abuse upon McKinley. This
personal issue is the only one so far apparent in the Democratic
campaign. When Mr. Caminetti abandons it, it is for a purpose.
He desires to make himself singular and invite Republican sup
port, which he will not get.
President Roosevelt has a long public career. He has been
in the focus of interest for years. Every legislative and adminis
trative trust he has held has been faultlessly discharged. He is
no tyro in the discharge of public duty. He has served his country
in peace and war. We all remember the enthusiasm that was felt
by men of all parties when he resigned as Assistant Secretary of
the Xavv to volunteer in the Spanish war and raise the regiment
of Rough Riders, accepting modestly a subordinate command and
sharing the hardships and vital risks of his comrades- in arms.
True, as he says now, "It was a little war, but it was all the war
there was,"' and he volunteered to fight for his country, while his
critics and detractors remained at home. Now that very, service
is used by hi* opponents and they seek to turn the term "Rough
Rider"' into a term of reproach.
But the President is not the first 'President who has had the
same kind of evil treatment. At the close of the Civil War, Grant,
recognizing the need of the hour, and overlooking the tempest of
passion that followed the tempest of war, said, "Let us have Peace."
Not long after some featherhead in New York started a paper
called "The Empire,*' advocating the conversion of the republic
into an imperial government. It had for its motto Grant's "Let
us have Peace. " and the Third Napoleon's saying, "L'Empire e'est
la Paix*' (the empire is peace). The Democracy made two cam
paigns against Grant on that. He was charged with being in
league with monarchists and plotting to destro\' the liberties of
the countrv.
MR. CAMIXETTI has at last accepted the task of opposing
Mr. Gillette for Congress in the First District. Mr. Gillette
is serving his first^ term. He entered Congress an ex
perienced legislator, through long service in the State legislature.
He was appointed to the Committee on the Judiciary, the great
law committee of the House, where his genius for work and his
ripe legal training were at once recognized, and he took first rank
on that committee, which is of the first class. He commended
himself to the workers of the House, by whom its actual business
is done, and it has not often occurred that a new member has
had such recognition and influence as he. On general principles,
a service so well begun should be confirmed and continued, as
his will be by the vote of his district. He. has deserved well of his
State and his immediate constituency, and will be rewarded.
No one knows why Mr. Caminetti first solicited the nomina
tion against him, then declined when nominated and now accepts
the place from the* State committee. He makes only one declara
tion and that is to the effect that in his campaign he will refrain
from personal attacks on the President. This indicates his inten
tion to hunt for Republican votes, by refraining from indecency. His
declaration is a rebuke to his party, but it will not secure Re
publican support. He is in fellowship with the men who rely on
slandering President Roosevelt to secure votes. Mr. Caminetti is,
no doubt, moved to this course by the experience of Mr. Lane, who
during his gubernatorial canvass avowed himself a "Roosevelt
Democrat/' and by praising the President took advantage of his
popularity to get Republican votes. The same trick in politics
will not work twice.

Perhaps the most curious story of
any vessel named for a sweetheart is
that pertaining to neither fishing
craft nor merchantman, but to a lit
tle skiff, familiar in the long ago wa
ters of Narragansett Bay. It was
owned by the good elder of a little
shore village, who for fifty years had
persistently courted a shy maiden of
the name of Rhoda Baker. So shy
was she that often when he called she
would not even see him. He would
find the sitting-room empty and the
chair from which she had fled at the
very moment of her "Come in!" yet
rocking by .the window.
At" length Rhoda died, still a spin
ster, and, her bereaved lover desired
to honor her memory by bestowing
her name upon his boat. But he en
countered a difficulty. Rhoda*s per
mission could not* be asked, and since
in life she had never accepted him, was
it fair or courteous to' her to dispense
with it? He solved this problem of
chivalry and avoided the least shadow
of presumption by naming the vessel
and painting - the name in- conspicu
ous black letters on the stern:. "Rhoda
Wouldn't."â Youth's Companion.
In one old New England seaport
there was, a few years ago, an aged
seaman whose favorite tune among
the many chanteys he was In the hab

a taking air â all he could remember
of a once popular sea song in -honor
of some fair unknown:
Hey. the charming Sally O!

Elder Gives Boat
Curious Name of
"Rhoda Wouldn't"
Woman Bore, a Positive Affliction,
Should Remember Her Friends
Have Troubles of Their Own
IT is an easier matter than most women realize to become a thoroughgo
ing bore. A trifling fanaticism on eome subject lacking in general inter
est; a little inconsiderateness of othersâ and the foundation is laid.
The man who bores is a sore trial; but the woman who possesses such
characteristic Is a positive affliction. Doubtless there are few readers
who have not met such a woman* She will recite for hours at a strecth the
troublesâ real and imaginaryâ which she experiences with her husband, chil
dren and servants. She will expound upon her own ailments and bore you
with the recital of pains and aches sufficient to fill a hospital ward.
She also usually complains of being a bundle of nerves, and yet takes a
keen delight In telling you the most sensational and harrowing news which
she has read, until she makes your flesh creep. And if you plead an engage
ment in order to escape her, she not only offers, but actually insists, in a
measure not to be denied, on accompanying you until she has exhausted her
fountain of talk. .
The grievances which such a woman has to tell you are inexhaustible. No
matter how earnestly she may work for the good of others, she is always
sure that no one appreciates" her efforts. The truth of the matter is that she
really does nothing at all without largely advertising the fact, and nobody
can appreciate self-praise. . ;
She talks of the failings of her husband, children and servants, totally
Ignoring her own faults, which, however, are very apparent to her friends.
She is not with you five minutes before she begins to tell you of the hours
which her husband spends at the club,- neglecting her night after night. No
wonder, you remark inwardly; the poor man tries to escape the affliction as
much as possible. If hi* wife bores him as much as she bores yo"u.
.Then there is the woman whose children treat her unfeelingly. She can
not mention them without enumerating all their petty faults and failings.
Her children torture her. and her servants wear her into shreds. In fact, to
judge from her tattles they seem to have been specially created by a spiteful
Providence to worry her into' an early grave.
But of all the women who bore their friends, perhaps the most to be de
spisedâfor. really she deserves nothing but contemptâ is the woman who fan
cies that she is entitled to fill some mission in the world, and bemoans her
fate because she married a poor or. incapable man, who cannot help her to
realize her hopes and ambitions. Such a woman makes her own life miser
able," as well- as the lives of every, one connected with her. What action can
be more mean on the part of a woman than: that of giving vent to thoughts
which are a continual* reproach to her, husband, because she is not what she
thinks she ought to be? Pride Bhould keep a woman from talking in such a
manner, even though she might have dissatisfied thoughts.
The, woman who would avoid becoming a" bore must remember that her
personal affairs and petty domestic troubles are of no particular interest to
any. one, except" perhaps to spiteful neighbors, to whom they form food for
gossip. If you meet or.vlsit a friend, the natural question is, "How are you
getting on?", or; something to that effect. But there is no necessity to enter
into the most minute details of your troubles or to bemoan your fate. . which,
after all, Is but cowardly. ! Friends have quite enough trouble and worry with
their own affairs without having to listen to a long recital of what doea not
concern them. " "V â¢. - .
Every woman, of course. Is. not a good conversationist, nor does she possess
the happy knack of being able to entertain friends with-pleaslng talk. In that
case it is a good plan to talk as little as possible. A good listener Is always
appreciated, no'matter where he or she maybe. You cannot bore any one by
Jlstening, and are. bound to win the good opinion of the talker.â Philadelphia

Editor The Call: An editorial In
the Chronicle September 15 discuss
ing the unionizing of teachers reminds
me of the schoolboy who wrote. "The
crab is a red fish that walks back
wards." The teacher replied, "Tour,
definition is good except that the crab
Is not red, is not a fish and does not
walk backward." So the said edito
rial deal3 not with facts, but with
fancy.
The first charge is a heinous one,
viz: That organizing school teachers
is a new idea. The editor of the
Chronicle is referred to Chijcago.
where a teachers' union has several
thousand members who are affiliated
With the Federated Trades and who
have received great benefits through
organization. New York City has a
teachers* union of 7000 members and
Is recognized as a bona fide trades
union. Coming nearer home, the
teachers of San Jose are unionized
and are affiliated with the State Fed_
eratlon of Labor. The teachers of
Santa Clara County also have a suc
cessful organization.
The second charge Is that teachers
should not be organized because they
have steady jobs and their compensa
tion and hours are regulated by law.
One of the largest unions in Boston Is
that of the municipal employes.
The thousands of men employed by
city, State and nation, are, as a rule,
union men. The letter carriers and
postal clerks are well organized, yet
their hours and wages are regulated by
law. Yes, this is true, but la a great
degree it was by their organizing that
those wages and hours were obtained.
If "teachers work for wages they mi*
wage earners, therefore eligible to a
union; and, further, that it Is their
duty to affiliate with the others who
helped to get the conditions they now
enjoy. The public schools of America
have no more loyal supporters than thÂ«
trades unions.

chest, even If it Is only a chintz-co-vered
window box. Therein she should stow
away all sorts of pretty things to be
used in the not impossible time when
she has a home of her own. To make
only for the present moment is like
living quite up to the limit of one's in
come, and distinctly. imprudent. Durln*
every year some dainty bit of work
"should be made especially to be laid
away for the future. Pretty undergar
ments, -elaborate towels, table embroid
' eries and such articles will gradually
accumulate under this system until a
most satisfying outfit is ready for thÂ»
i happy occasion when it will be needed.
And the pleasure of adding to the storÂ»
will more than make up for the waiting
to use the contents of the treasure box.

NEW YORK, Sept. 16.â Early effort
to support prices of . stocks to-day
seemed to prove futile and there waÂ«
a time when the market seemed to be
abandoned to the liquidators. But the
selling diminished largely at the lower
level and encouraged the friends of
higher prices to renew their supporting
tactics. The news did not offer a clear
explanation of these varying opera
tions. The grangers and Pacifies were
under heavy pressure during the first
half of the session in spite of the reac
tionary movement of grains. Tna
weather reports from the grain regions
were of higher temperature and failed
to bear out last night's forecast of tne
development of another cold wave In
the Northwest . The market sank to a
lower level with Pennsylvania the sole
reliance for support " ? of prices. That
stock ultimately gave way with the
rest of the market. It was at a dis
advantage with reports in circulation
of a contemplated strike on the part
of some trainmen on the Western .lines
of the system. The extension of the
strike among employes of the United
States Steel â¢ Corporation in the Ma
honing Valley bore on these stocks and
forced them a point under last night
with sentimental effect on the whole
list. ( The steel stocks, however, re
sumed the leadership of the recovery
in the market later, sharing with Read
ing in that respect. The market was
much'quieter than yesterday or during
the week and lacked the vigor which
has been a recent feature. Colorado
Fuel made another dip and was an in
fluence on the early depression. Amal
gamated Copper rose in face of the
general declining tendency without
other explanation than a sharp rise in
the price of copper in London. Gross
earnings for the first week in Septem
ber made a favorable comparison with
the corresponding week last year, the
ratio of increase for roads thus far
reporting reaching 4.18 per cent. The
rising rate for money seemed to dis
turb speculative sentiment for a time,
but its influence decreased during the
day. The currency movement up to
Thursday night shows a loss in cash
by the banks of upward of $6,000,000,
the loss to the sub-treasury alone ac
counting for $5,182,000. The liquidation
in the stock market during the week
is expected to affect the loan item or
the banks, but the usual uncertainty
prevails regarding the complexion of
that item in to-morrow's bank state
ment. The noted strength developed
in United States Steel preferred and
Reading induced a substantial recovery
in the whole market. The closing was
Irregular, but above last night's level.
Bonds were irregular. .Total sales,

PACIFIC GROVE. Sept. 16.â In ex
ecutive session to-day the California
Methodist Episcopal Conference passed
upon the Qualifications of candidates
for admission to the ministry. Gustaf
A. Werner, Fred W. Axe. B. J.
Schneider, F. R. Gillette, Robert J.
Coyne, Woo Pying* King, N. M. Par
sons, M. W. Frary, L>uyonoshin
Kawashima and Wilfred Kent were ad
mitted on trial. Woo Pying Kinjr 1*
a Korean, the first ever admitted to
this conference. HÂ« has a charge in
Hawaii. Tokujl Komura, David Rals
ton, Edwin H. Smith, G. A. Reeder and
Samuel Quickmire were admitted to
full membership. Edward D. Raley wai
elected to deacon's orders.
Â» The case of F. A. Morrow, regarding
whose character numerous unfavorable
reports have been in circulation for
some time, was brought up. Morrow
has been holding a supernumerary re
lation for the past three years and his
request to be given a charge this year
has resulted in the demand for an In
vestigation of his character. A com
mittee of inquiry, consisting of W. W.
Case (presiding). A. J. Hanson, T. A.
Towner, Ell McCllsh. Thomas Filben,
J. F. Jenness, A. C. Welch, F. D.
Bovard, W. T. Mayne, G. W. Beatty,
T. A. Atkinson, J. B. Chynoweth, John
Stephens. George W. White and W. S.
Urmy, was appointed to Investigate
the rumors regarding Morrow and de
cide whether they form sufficient basis
for a trial.
The committee spent all the after
noon in session behind closed doors
and examined many witnesses. As a
result of the testimony adduced spe
cific charges are being formulated, and
at to-morrow morning's session the
accused minister will *be formally
charged with' flagrant immorality.
The offenses alleged extend back over
a period of eight years to the time
when Morrow had a pastorate in Sac
ramento.
Dr.- J. D. Hammond, who was sus
pended from ministerial duties for one
year at the last conference, having
been found- guilty of imprudence and
unministerial. conduct, has applied for
appointment to a charge, and it is
more than likely that when the names
of the different ministers are called
his character will be passed without
question, and that he will be restored
to full membership in the conference.
There is practically no opposition to
Dr. Hammond's restoration to full
membership.
At the annual meeting of the Lay
Association to-night the following
were elected: President, L.*lu Dennett
of Modesto; vice presidents, I. D.
Jamie8on of Alameda and Miss Carrie
C. Davis of San Francisco; recording
secretary. B. L. Weymouth of Pacific
Grove; corresponding secretary,' James
E. White of San Francisco; treasurer,
F. I*. Turpln of San Francisco.

Arrivals of Potatoes were unusually heavy,
being more than twice the quantity received
on the "preceding day. As a result the market
had an easier tone, but prices were no lower,
as it was not expected that the receipts would
continue heavy. Onions. < too, .-were In in
creased supply, but the filling of some ship
ping orders held prices steady.
Tomatoes were in excessive supply and lower,
receipts being large and the carry-over from
the preceding day heavy. The 'canners were
purchasing rather freely at the inside quota
tion, but the market failed to clean up. Lima
Beans were in limited supply and firmer. The
other vegetables stood about as previously
quoted.

The current situation in Hay is firmer, as
receipts by rail are down to nothing, and as
the recent excessive arrivals are at la? t out of
the way buyers are again In the market. It
Is now no trouble to sell good Hay at full fig
ures. The situation is this: There are about
700 loaded cars on the sidetracks in the dif
ferent Hay districts in the . interior, and as
the local yards are now practically clear the
railroads have a good chance to get them in.
but they are not doing it. The Hay men want
this Hay .and are holding daily consultations
with the railroad officials In order to facili
tate Its movement. When all this country ac
cumulation begins to come In the market may
weaken again, but at present the situation Is
better than for . some weeks.
Bran continues weak under the free receipts
from the north, but prices are unchanged.

The local market continues quiet and un
changed. The Chicago wires of E. F. Hutton

market, with the dragging tendency that we
have been obliged to notice for a long time.
Packers talk bullish and would like to get bet
ter prices for their distributive demand, but
the speculative buying shows little or no im
provement and the action of the market con
tinues discouraging."

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS
From start to finish the wheat market was
characterized by extreme weakness. A belief
that I he present bull campaign had reached
its tentth apparently prevailed quite gener
ally In ihe> dH, and as a result the market
was subjected to heavy realizing sales through,
out the entire session. Warmer weather in
the "West and Northwest was perhaps the most
influential factor effecting the market. The
Improvement in weather conditions, together
with lower cables, caused liberal bellinc at
the or-enins asd initial sales were made at
a considerable decile* from yesterday's cics
lng limitation.*, December being down %6rsC
to &sff>*c at $1 14*401 15 &. May opened
%QV,c to lower At $1 ieii@l lÂ«ii.
A flipht rally occurred eoon after the opening
en covering by shorts, the May option ad
vancing to $1 16*;. The rally was only
momentary, however, the market soon weaken
ing again under free offerings. The weakness
of the wheat markets in the Northwest was
a powerful influence in the situation berÂ«
during the latter part of the day. A decline
of 4}Â±c in ca*h prices at Duluth and a sharp
break in values at Minneapolis seemed to
presage a more liberal country movement in
that sfection. .
A reoort of a St. Louis trade journal
was cocBtrued as bearish, the announcement
being made that weather conditions were
highly favorable for seeding 'operations and
tlm a hirsre acreage was assured. B-jforo
the declining tendency was checked price*
were l'c below the high ooint of the - day.
December sold off to $1 13 and May to $1 14%;
Final q-jotaticyis on December were at ?1 13%0
1 13J-4. May closed at 81 14TiÂ©l 15.
Clearances of wheat and flour were equal to
40.COO busb-jls. Exports for the week, accord
ing to Itradntreets, were equal to 936.000
bushels. Primary receipts were 052,000 bushels,
compared with 1,057,100 bushels a year ago.
Minneapolis Duluth and Chicago reported re
ceipts of 734 cars, against 434 last week and
779 a year ago.
Prospects of better weather, continued large
primary receipts and the slump in wheat were
the factors that accounted for a break of 10
In the price of corn. The opinion seemed to
prevail that the crop Is now practically -out ot
froet danger. Longs were liberal sailers
throughout the entire day. December opened
VÂ»t*%c to MffHc lower, at 51%Â©52e, sold be
tween 5041c and 52 He and closed at 51 He
Local receipts were 505 cars, with thirty-eight
of contract srade.
In spite Of th* weakness of wheat and corn,
the oat market held steady. December opened
Â»;c lower, at 32UÂ£32 a^c. sold up to 32%c and
clos>Â«d at the top. Local receipts were 112
cars. V '
Influenced by the weakness of "corn and by
the continued liquidation of October holdings,
the provision market had an easier undertone.
Trading was quiet. At the close January pork
was down 2^ie^c. at $12 75. Lard was off
SQT'-c at $7 1G@7 12 H. R ibs were unchanged

offerings of Grapes in crates were firm, being
wanted for shipment, while ordinary offerings
la small packages dragged at irregular prices.
Large open boxes were generally steady. ThÂ«
Apple market was decidedly weaker, with
stocks of all grades excessive. SomÂ« dealers
were still quoting f? 50 per box for fancy

ferings of Peaches in small packages were
chiefly of low grade and prices ranged lower.

Captain Ahern says the Filipinos are
rapidly becoming accustomed to Amer
ican, methods of government, and that
they have shown a decided change | for
the better during the last twelve
months.* He added that Americans in
the Philippines, do not like the Idea Â«f
paying duty on goods from the United
States, and he expressed the opinion
that a system of internal revenue
would soon be ''substituted for the cus
toms tarift as a. means for the main
tenance 'of: the government of the
islands.
We have a forest reservation also which is
set aside for special protection, to conserve
either the water flow of certain streams or
the forest itself. The only difference be
tween the reservations and other, public forests
is that the reservations cannot be entered upon
as homesteads or sold. . Â¦ ; â¢
There are between 500 and 700 kinds of
timber taken out, there being fully 1500 kinds
of wood In the Islands. Sometimes forty dif
ferent species are found on one acre of cround.
On one tract of 100 square . miles you will
find fully 400 different species.
*We have a large workshop Jn Manila su
perintended by â¢ three expert cabinet-makers
from Rochester, , N. T., assisted by thirty or
forty Filipinos. In this snop we endeavor to
show i the values â¢ and beauties of different
woods, especially of the kinds that are found
In greatest abundance.
In the â¢ Philippines we did not start. In on
scientific work, but first endeavored â¢ to shew
results In revenue. We made $100,000 thÂ«
first year, *1CO,000 the second and then $280,
000. So. after the first year, when I asked
for appropriations, they were very generous.
Before having legislation on the subject I
had a talk for two days with the lumbermen â
Chinese. Spanish and Filipinos. We have as a
rule .public discussion- of public acts - before,
they are passed, so when, this came up then
was very little left to be said after our con
ference.

Is the "gladdest day of all the
year" for the little lads and lassies
over . in the gray stone house on the
San Anselmo hillsâ the San Anselmo
Orphanage.
For to-day are the gardens and
lawns of the Kent home at Kentfleld
(near Ross) turned over for the making
of dollars and dimes for the main
tenarfce of the orphanage and which is
under the patronage of many charming
maids and matrons from this side and
from San Rafael and Ross.
Loads of attractions will interest the
hosts of good folkâ big and littleâ who
go over for sweet charity's sake.
There will be willing donkeys to ride,
which have given their word to behave
decorously and not "buck." Baskets
of grapes, grown on the Kent acres,
purple and luscious, will be sold for
the little inmates of the gray stone
house on the hill, ice cream, candy and
all the dear sweet things of .childhood.
A Scottish piper promises to play the
bonny airs of "Auld Scotland" and
fetching ballads will be sung by Wil
liam Balnaves and Mrs. John Dempster
McKee. Â¦
The Presbyterian Orphanage should
be the happier to-night by a thousand
dollars for the day's labor of love at
Kent. Those who go over early for a
day's outing under the purpling grapes
and the soft . magnolias need have no
haunting fears of hungerâ for luncheon
will be served by some mighty, pretty
maidsâ and served for a quarterâ with
change back. - .

The musical part of â¢ the reception of
the Sovereign Grand Lodge Ms , in' the:
hands of the eminent' director, Carl
Sawvell, w ho . has organized \ a * grand
chorus numbering five hundred voices.
With a few rehearsals he has. brought
them .to a. standard worthy the mas
ters whose works they are singing. '
The chairman of the music commit
tee. Past' Grand Master W.-W. Wat
eon., has .been untiring, in his efforts
in, assisting Director Sawvell to en
roll member* for the chorus. â¢'
The chorus -Is made lip: chiefly of
good material and. a musical treat of
more than ordinary merit ; is In store
for, Monday and Tuesday-evenings,
September 19 and 20.; _â¢â¢:
Mr." Sawvell has written for, the first
night a 'grand â¢ "Welcome Choral,"
words and â¢ music, which has ; been re-j
celved very favorably; the second num-.

FIVE HUNDRED VOICES.
The following executive committee
v.as appointed and will- meet 'thfs
morning "at 11 o'clock in the Mayor's
office to discuss and arrange further
'details. ' ;Â¦-. " Â¦:"
Allan Pollok, manager of the Hotel
St. Francis, offered to provide the com
mittee headquarters at the hotel. This
was accepted with a vote of thanks
and . on. Monday next the committee
will open offices on the mezzanine floor
of t,he hotel. A statement by Andrea
Sbarboro, president of the California
Promotion Committee, that that body
would be happy to receive visiting Odd
Ffcllows, was , recorded, with apprecia
tion. ' '.: ' . â¢" " .
chanics" Pavilion next Friday night
shall be a full dress affair. This de
cision, the committee believes, will re
sult in a much more effective function
and will better preserve the dignity
of the order. A scene presented by a
mighty mass of people whirling in the
waltz, some hatted, others hatless,
seme in full dress and others in outing
suits, is never pleasing. This the com
mittee is going to avoid. ;.
The citizens' committee, organized
to further the interests of the city and
State during the Knights .Templar Con
clave, having decided to lend its aid
also to the Odd Fellows, conferred .yes
terday with a committee from the last
named organization. The meeting was
held in the office of Mayor Schmitzin
the City Hall and many suggestions
were offered and accepted that will
tend to insure' the success of the en
campment.- -

Hall, which will be decorated in a way
to illustrate in a distinctive man

liberal supply of fruits. As the order
does not permit the use of wines or
