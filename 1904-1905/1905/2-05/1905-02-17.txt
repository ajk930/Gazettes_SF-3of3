JAY COOKE'S
LIFE CLOSES
SUDDENLY
Noted Financier Dies
After a Short
Illness.
Rayages ol Old Age Bring
Unexpected Physical
Collapse.
Remarkable Career of Man Who Lost
and Segaiaed an Enormous
Fortune.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 10. â Jay
Cooke, the noted financier, died at 10.
Â©clock to-night at the Ogontz residence
of his son-in-law, Charles D. Barney,
after an illness of only twenty-four
hours. Three days Ago Cooke appeared
to be in his usual health and gave his
yearly entertainment for the young
women of Ogontz Seminary. At his
bedside, when death came, were all of
mmediate family, including Jay
Cooke the second and Jay Cooke the
third.
Barney attributes Cooke's death to
old age. He announced that Cooke had
been unconscious three or four hours
before he died, but refused to give any
further information. Since he was
stricken with congestion of the brain
at his summer home on Gibraltar Isls
end, off Sandusky, Ohio, on Octolsar 1,
Oookc had been more or less of
an invalid.
Jay Cooke was born in Sanducky,
Ohio with no prospect in life
except such as might follow his own
endeavors. Many years will pass be
fore the name of Jay Cooke will be
:ten as that of the man who saved
the nation from financial ruin in the
Civil War. After becoming bankrupt
in the greatest failure the country has
ever known he lived to pay all of his
in full. Even after 3200 per
Â«onc who Met through confidence in
had received more than dollar for
dollar, he still had recovered his for
tune, so that he died a multi-million
aire.
Cooke's second rise to fortune was,
however, due to his possessing the very
foresight which he declared he did not
have. In one fortunate investment in
a mine in Utah he cleared more than
$1,000,000.
UXIOX PACIFIC COMMON
TO PAY SIX PER CENT
Director's Statement Accounts for In
crease in Market Value of
Shares.
NEW YORK. Feb. 16. â A director
of the Union Pacific said to-day that
when the directors of the company
considered the dividend question next
rummer they would vote to place
common stock on a 6 per cent divi
dend basis. This statement accounts
for the strength in the stock recently
and for the predictions that Union
Pacific common would sell at 150
coon.
Th*Â» promise of a 6 per cent rate
if= amply justified by the earnings of
the system, particularly in view of the
fact that the Southern Pacific may be
put on a dividend basis within the
present year, resulting in considerable
"other income" for the Union Pacific
through its ownership of $90,000,000
Southern Pacific stock.

CONQUERED
BY A GERM
Medical Science Is
Victorious Over
Disease.
Successful Treatment ol Pa
tients Witn Antitoxin of
Diphtheria.
Five Cases Are Absolutely Cured by
Physician in Gouverneur
Hospital
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â From the re
markable results attained during the
last few days at Gouverneur Hospital
from a new treatment for cerebro
spinal meningitis, it appears that sci
ence has won another decisive round in
its struggle with disease. Up to the
present time there has been no accept
ed treatment for this dread disease. Its
mortality has varied from 80 per cent
in its worst stages of an epidemic to 30
per cent when the epidemic is on wane,
and of those cured a large percentage
have retained their lives at the ex
pense of their hearing, their power of
speech, their eyesight or the use of
their limbs.
Many men of science will doubt the
possibility of a germ of one disease
killing that of another, but the results
in eight cases under the charge of Dr.
Edward Waitzfelder at Gouverneur
Hospital are astounding.
That his antitoxin of diphtheria had
a remarkable effect upon the germ of
spinal meningitis was discovered about
four weeks ago by Dr. Wolf, a bacteri
ologist, of Hartford, Conn. Dr. Wolf's
experiments were confined chiefly to
the laboratory', though he tried his
antitoxin in four cases in Hartford,
upon request. Dr. Wolf sent to Dr.
Waitzfelder the results of his experi
ments and the latter put them at once
to the test in the Gouverneur Hospital,
to which most of the cases of men
ingitis among the poor were sent.
Of eight cases in which Dr. Waitz
felder has used the antitoxin, five
have been absolutely cured without any
subsequent complications and two
show improvement.
This is a result hitherto unparalleled
in the history of disease. Dr. Waitz
felder, who goes back in his experience
to the great epidemic of 1873, says that
he has never known seven consecutive
cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis that
have recovered.
BALFOUR'S
MINISTRY
TRIUMPHS
Victorious in House
ol Commons by
311 to 248.
LONDON, Feb. 16.â H. H. Asquith's
amendment to the reply to the speech
from the throne was defeated in the
House of Commons to-night by a vote
of 311 to 248.
This amendment, which declared
"that the prospects of the fiscal ques
tion have been fully discussed in the
cuntry for nearly two years and that
the time has come for submitting the
question to the people without further
df-lay," was debated throughout to
dny's session of the House of Commons.
No particular interest was aroused
until within an hour of the time for
the division, when Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman spok** at some length, at
tacking Premier Balfour and charging
that he was afraid to face the country
or the House of Commons with a
definite statement of his position with
regard to Chamberlain's programme.
The speaker challenged Balfour to ap
peal to thp country and taunted the
iji.vprnment with filibustering in order
to gain time and delay inevitable de
feat.
Balfour replied, but did not afford
th* opposition the satisfaction of any
lengthy explanation of his opinion of
Chamberlain's policy.

President Orders a

His Instructions.

Prosecutions Will Follow

Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON', Feb. 16.â Begin at
once. Go to the bottom. Report early."
This was the substance of President
Roose%-elt's message to-day to the De
partment of Commerce and Labor in
response to the Campbell resolution
adopted by the House yesterday re
questing an investigation of the Stand
ard Oil Company. It means the begin
ning of an investigation of the most im
portant industrial corporation in the
United States. In the opinion of author
ities the resolution will result in crim
inal prosecutions for violation of the
Federa l . anti-trust laws.
President Roosevelt's order was pro
mulgated at the White House after a
conference with Representative Camp
bell, who went over the Kansas situa
tion in detail. The operations of the
Standard Oil Company which resulted
in the closing of 4000 oil wells in that
State were fully described. The Presi
dent was astonished to learn of the
extreme steps taken there to crush out
competition. He expressed himself
as much interested in the subject, and
told Campbell the machinery of the
National Government would be put into
operation at once, not only to investi
gate in Kansas, but to inquire into all
the doings of the Standard Oil Com
pany and its correlated corporations.
FAR-REACHING ORDER.
President Roosevelt dictated the or
der to Secretary Loeb and it was sent
to Secretary Metcalf, who in ifitn sent
it to Commissioner Garfield of the Bu
reau of Corporations. After this the
President had a conference with Gar
held for a preliminary discussion of
pians for the investigation.
Commissioner Garfleld considers the
scope of the Campbell resolution much
broader than any ever considered in
Congress bearing upon an investigation
ot any kind of combination of capital
ists. It means that specific charges of
restraint of trade in Kansas will be
established and all methods practiced
by officers and agents of the company
in all its business operations in this
country will be gone into. This includes
its various pipe lines, of which there
are thousands of miles; its tank trans
portation service, which employs at
least 20,000 private cars, and its steam
boat service.
HOKE SMITH ON THE GRILL.
Secretary Hitchcork to-day gave out
a statement arraigning as a "gigantic
monopoly" that present lease by the
Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Com
pany of the right to prospect for oil
and gas throughout the entire area of
the Osage Indian Reservation and ex
plaining the agreement reached several
days ago for cutting off more than
one-half of the lands operative under
this lease during the next ten years.
The statement sets forth that what is
known as the Osage oil lease, granting
the exclusive right to prospect, develop
and sublet for oil and gas throughout
the entire 1,500,000 acres of the Osage
Indian lands, was granted for ten
years by the then Secretary of the In
terior, Hoke Smith, on March 16, 1898,
to Edwin B. Foster, but that "after
a checkered existence," the lessee is
known as the Indian Territory Illum
inating Oil Company.
TERMED A "PUBLIC SCANDAL."
"It was," says 'this statement, "one
of the most gigantic monopolies ever
issued for an individual or company by
any Secretary of the Interior. The
original lease was nothing short of a
public scandal."
Secretary Bliss Investigated the lease
with a view to canceling it, but found
he could not legally do so. The state
ment says Secretary Hitchcock espe
cially opposed the extension of the
original lease because the company is
obtaining from the Indians practically
50 per cent of the royalty accruing to
the Indians who own the property
while the sub-lessees provide the capi
tal. An amendment to the Indian ap
propriation bill incorporating the final
conclusion reached by the various in
terests and the department. Intended to
protect both the Indians and the sub
lessees, cuts the lands operative under
the lease to 680,000 acres.

MRS. CODY
ACCUSED BY
EX-SERVANT
Alleged to Have Ad :
ministered Drug
to Husband.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Feb. 16.âSensa
tional testimony was introduced to-day
in the suit of Colonel William F. Cody
for a divorce from Mrs. Eliza Cody.
The first deposition was by Mrs. John
W. Boyer of North Platte, Neb., whose
husband was in the employ of Cody for
many years, she acting d housekeeper
at the ranch.
Mrs. Boyer swore that she knew Mrs.
Cody gave the colonel a drug. Mn.
Cody, she said, bought the drug of a
gypsy and it was called "dragon's
blood." It made the colonel sick. Once
it was put into his coffee cup, but Mrs.
Boyer changed the cups so that Mrs.
Cody drank the coffee. She became
ill.
Once, the witness said, Mrs. Cody
gave her husband some of the drug be
fore he went to a banquet and he fell
helpless at the banquet. At another
time, after a quarrel, the colonel, she
swore, took a drfnk of the fluid and
Mrs. Cody exclaimed:
"I've got him now where I iwant
him."
He went to a play, then to a supper,
was taken ill and had to be carried
home.
Attorneys for the defense attempted
to show that the plaintiff was fre
quently intoxicated and Mrs. Boyer ad
mitted tltat when he was in such con
dition he acted much the same as when
alleged to have been drugged. Mrs.
Boyer also admitted that she had
quarreled with the defendant.

Statesmen of the Upper House Are
Disposed to Move Slowly.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16. â As out
lined exclusively in a dispatch to The
Call yesterday, President Roosevelt's
message transmitting the new Santo
Domingo protocol to the Senate is a
full discussion of the whole subject,
with the Monroe doctrine in the fore
ground. If we are to maintain the
Monroe doctrine and keef foreign
Governments out of the Western
hemisphere, the President argues, we
must collect their debts for them. If
we are not to do this, then we muit
either drop the Monroe doctrine or
fight for it under great disadvantages.
President Roosevelt is ready to un-y
dertake the task. He invites the Sen
ate to join him. Sanguine, active,
ready to put thing to rights wherever
he thinks them wrong, the President
would not hesitate a minute.
Not so the Senate. That conserva
tive body does hesitate.
It sees brought before it the whole
problem of doing police and debt col
lecting duty .throughout the Western
hemisphere. It sees in a new light the
responsibilities which the Monroe doc
trine puts into the hands of the young
and optimistic President. It Is, of
course, too early to say that the Senate
is disposed to be hostile. Not many
of the Senators had read the Presi
dent's letter and protocol to-night, as
it was a very busy day in the Senate.
But there is a disposition to go about
this business in leisurely fashion.
ARGIMEXT OF SENATORS.
The older Senators argue in this
way: Suppose the Senate ratifies
this treaty, binds the United States to
keep order by using force and settles
Santo Domingo's debt, which shall be
the next country the United States
must put in order? It will have es
tablished a precedent for the Western
Hemisphere. It might be all right to
do this in Santo Domingo, because it
lies near its door; but suppose it has
to go next time to Uruguay or Pata
gonia?
The United States did establish a
protectorate over Cuba, but Santo Do
mingo is not on all fours with Cuba.
The latter was ready for self-govern
ment. The United States establishes
a protectorate over Santo Domingo t>y
this treaty and that is the thing the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Senate will discuss before giving the
President his answer.
In addition to the President's dis
cussion of the Monroe doctrine in the
case of Santo Domingo, the protocol
itself makes specific declaration of Mi
application and in that respect is un
usual -in treaty making. The declara
tion occurs in the second paragraph,
which recites that the Government of
the United States views any attempt
of governments outside jof this hemi
sphere to depress the destiny of the
Dominican. republic as a manifestation
of an unfriendly disposition toward
the United States." j.
TEXT OF THE MESSAGE.
, In f his message . the 4 President says:
The conditions in the republic of Santo Do
min*o hayÂ« been growing steadily won* for
many years. There have been many disturb
ances and revolutions. 'ana debts have been
contracted beyond the power of the republic to
repay, some of these debts were properly con
tracted and ara held by those who have a le
gitimate right to their * money. Others are
without question improper or exorbitant con
stituting claims which should never be paid in
full, and perhaps only to the extent of a very
email portion of their nominal value.
'* Certain countries have long : felt .themselves
aggrieved because of the non-payment of debts
due to their citizens. The only way by which
foreign creditors could ever obtain from the
republic itself any guaranty of payment would
be either by the 'acquisition of territory out
right or temporarily, or else by takings posses
sion of the custom houses, which would of
course, in Itself, fa effect be taking possession
of a certain amount of territory.
It has for some time been obvious that those
who profit by the Monroe doctrine must accept
certain responsibilities along with the rights
which It confers. -and that the same statement
applies to those who upheld the doctrine. It
cannot be . too often and too emphatically as
serted that the United States has . not the
slightest desire â¢; for . territorial aggrandizement
at. the expense of any of its southern neigh
bors, and will not ' treat the Monroe doctrine
as . an excuse for such > aggrandisement , on its
part. Wo do not propose to take any part 'of

BOODLING SENATORS HOPE TO ESCAPE PUNISHMENT
BY PLEADING A DEFECT IN THEIR INDICTMENTS
CLAIM DOCIMENTS ARE VALUELESS
AS AIDS TO PROSECUTION.
SURPRISE FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 16. â Buoyed
up, If not exhilarated, by newly discov
ered fact* and confident legal assur
ance that they are safe from the law
and the penalty for Its breach. Sena
tors Emmons, Bunkers, French and
Wright were at their desks this morn
ing. They have been assured that the
indictment against them. will crumble
with the first assault, and District At
torney Seymour, anxious over the turn
affairs have taken, is raking the musty
volumes of the State law library in
search of precedents he hopes will
maintain the position he has taken.
One thing has developed to a cer
tainty and that is that the accused
will not plead to the charges against
them before Judge Hart next Satur
day morning, but that counsel for th?
detense, headed by ex-Senator H. V.
Morehouse of San Jose, who is now
busily engaged digging into the law of
the case, will demand that the indict
ments be set aside and their clients
set free. If Judge Hart refuses to
quash the indictments, a contingency
counsel for the defense maintain is
improbable, an appeal will be. taken
Immediately to the Supreme Court
and â¢tee trial 'delayed for months if
not years, if. .indeed, the case the Dis
trict Attorney of this county has tried
bo hard to perfect does not fall alto
gether.
District Attorney Seymour is con-
Iron ted with a condition that, it is ad
mitted, was not well worked out be
fore the indictments were filed. The
indictments contain no specific men
tion of "any matter pending before
the Legislature" that was the direct
issue upon which the bribe was paid,
end counsel for the defense, the pros
ecution asserts, is armed with author
ities maintaining their position that
8 mere probability of a question aris
ing that might be the subject of con
sideration by the Legislature is not
nor cannot be the subject of bribery
and a charge of bribery will not lie.
even should the accused admit that
they did accept the money it Is
charged they did.
< in: CONSTITUTION*.
Now as to the law upon which this
hypothesis is* based. Section 35 of arti
cle IV of the State constitution says:
"Any member of the Legislature who
shall be influenced in his vote or ac
tion upon any matter pending before
the Legislature by any reward or
promise of future reward shall be
deemed guilty of a felony," etc.
Now as to the facts. It is maintained
by the defense that there was no mat
ter pending before the Legislature that
was the subject of the alleged bribery.
It is maintained by thÂ« prosecution
that the bribe was taken by the ac
cused to influence their action in re
gard to a proposed investigation of cer
tain building and loan associations that,
it is admitted, had not begun when the
bribe was paid.
This, say counsel for the accused, in
no way constitutes a matter pending
before the Legislature, hence the in
dictment must fall. They further main
tain that all bills relating to building
and loan associations were before com
mittees other than that of which the
accused were members, and that in any
event it is not charged that the bribe
was paid to influence the vote of the
accused in relation to these bills, but
only in relation to an investigation
that was not yet under way.
As to the proof of the guilt of the
accused, the defense maintains that all
of the talk of several marked bills that
were handed to the accused and sub
sequently passed by them having been
recovered is all rot.
"If the prosecution has recovered any
of the bills," said a friend of the ac
cused to-day, "it is only one. Those
bills are all intact with the exception

of the Senators to his wife, and even
she knows where that is, bo they can
not b^so well armed with documentary
evidence as they are seeking to make
the public believe in order to frighten
the accused. But we would not care if
they had all of the bills. We have au
thorities that sustain our position that
matters not pending before the Legisla
ture cannot bo the subject of bribery
by legislators, and the accused will go
lice without a doubt."
ATTORNEYS HOPEFUL.
"There â¢Â£ nothing to this case," said
Attorney Jacobs, one of the counsel
for the defense, to-day, "except murder
of reputation. The first thing we will
do is to knock out the indictments next
Saturday and then will come a sensa
tion. Our clients will then go before
the Senate committee and tell their
story. After the indictments have
fallen the investigating committee can
have no further objection to permitting
the accused to testify before them
under oath. When they do this things
will take on an entirely different tone
and I know that when the accused
have been heard the report of the
committee and the final judgment of
the Senate will be entirely different
from what the public believes at this
time it will be."
Whether the ruling of the Superior
Court on the demurrer to the indict
ment that will lx> argued Saturday will
come in time to forestall the report of
the investigating committee is a ques
tion. Senator Relshaw, chairman of
the committee, will return here Friday
and the committee will Immediately go
into txecutive session to discuss what
action it should take. There is much
evidence to be srone over, however, and
tt is hardly probable that a report run
bp prepared before the middle of next
v eek. If this should prove to be the
case nncl the demurrer to the Indict
ment is sustained there is no question
that the committee will then listen
tii the appeal of the accused, swear
them and permit them to complete
their defense.
it is wHI known that if the accused
are finally permitted to take the stand
before the committee the onus of
the scandal will fall heavier on Joseph
S. Jordan, whose confession stands
agrainst the disgraced Senators and
brands them aÂ« bribers. Each of the
accused will swear that even though
Joseph S. Jordan did receive the money

WAR IN ASSEMBLY.
Appropriation Bills Cause Display or
Considerable Feeling.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 16â An inter
esting little row, which may have re
sults materially affecting I^he course of
legislation in the Assembly, took place
in that house during the session to
night. Chairman Stanton of the Ways
and Means Committee arrayed himself
against the House and was worsted.
The trouble arose over a modest little
bill of Johnstone's appropriating $3900
with which to buy a water flow of five
inches for the Whittier school. The bill
had been adversely reported on by
Stanton's committee. It came up for
second reading, and Johnstone saying
nothing, Stanton made a motion to
amend by striking out the enacting
clause, which is one method of killing
billF.
The Assembly turned Stanton down
by beating his motion. He did not take
the action kindly.
An effow may be made to-morrow to
have a resolution adopted binding the
House to accept the recommendations
of the Ways and Means Committee.
Failure to carry this may bring on an
agitation in the committee to follow
Star.ton'B suggestion of turning hack
the bills. T
Rolley of Humboldt has a bill before
the committee appropriating $32,000 for
jetties on the Eel River. He declares
if it Is reported against he will fight on
the floor for its passage. Dorsey's bill
asking $60,000 for levees on the Kern
River was also reported against. He
also will fight, on the floor for the
passage of this bill if the committee
turns it dow n.
AMENDS PILOTAGE BILL.
Nelson 'Â« Metmure Changed to Suit

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 16.â The Senate
Committee on Commerce and Naviga
tion to-night reported out Nelson's
pilotage bill, amended so as to leave
the rates as th<=>y now stand but doing
away entirely with the so-called half
pilotage fees. The pilots are strongly
opposed to the elimination of half
pilotage, but the shippers, who point
|Â» the Injustice of being compelled to
pay half-pilotage even when they sail
or tow their own vessels in, stand in
favor of the measure.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1905.
LAW STUDENTS
OF THE SOUTH
WIN VICTORY
May Practice on Diplomas
ol Southern California
University.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 16.â Persistency
has won for Houser of Los Angeles the
passage of his pet measure, the bill
admitting graduates of the law depart
ment of the Southern California Uni
vtrsity to practice before the Supreme
Court on their diplomas. Afifer two
defeats he called the bill up for the
third time this morning in the Assem
bly and it was carried by a vote of
51 to 14.
The debate was Interesting as it
bore on the alleged strained relations
that have existed between Houser and
the San Francisco delegation, which
were responsible, it is said, for the past
defeats of the bill. It is also said that
its passage to-day was due partly to
the fact that it was understood Houser
intends to r>e good in future.
Rolley of Humboldt intimated that
many members had voted against the
measure simply to vote against its
author. Coghlan of San Francisco de
nied this. "If anything would recom
mend a bill from Los Angeles to me as
being an honest bill it would be the
fact that Mr. Houser introduced it,"
he said.
McGowan also resented the intima
tion by Rolley, saying he had voted
against the measure and not the man.
He did not think a private institution
should be given the privilege that now
was held only by the University of
California. Dorsey also expressed his
high regard for Houser. but said he
was still opposed to the bill. Stanton
n!si> spoke against it, though he said
some of the faculty were friends and
constituents of his.

tion for reconsideration was made by
Cromwell and the House granted the
permission. Immediate passage was
asked by Cromwell. The unexpected
turn in the matter brought on a debate.
FOREST PRESERVATION.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 16.â The bill
providing for the protection and man
agement of the forests of California.
under an enlightened system^, now on
the tiles as Assembly bill No. 712 and
Senate bill No. 63gS, was prepared by
the Bureau of Forestry of the United
States Department of Agriculture,
under the co-operative arrangement
provided by the State Legislature of
190L'.
The aim of the Bureau of Forestry
I is merely to recommend that which is
best for the forest welfare of the State.
The most urgent need being fire pro
tection, recommendations to this end
have been submitted in the form of
the bill herein nientioned.
'The necessity for State action in
Regulating the forests of the comrnorf
wealth is evident. The Federal forest
reserves comprise only one-third of the
forested area, leaving two-thirds, or
more than 20,000.000 acres, without pro
tection of any kind and subject to all
the misuses of wasteful lumbering and
fire. With the timber industries third
in importance in the State, and the
future Umber supply and water inter
ests dependent on these forests, the
far-reaching results of steps to secure
more rational treatment of these for
ested areas are of incalculable value.
It is as plainly a State duty to reg T
ulate the forests as to look after the
mining interests, agriculture and fish
eries. The forested States of the East
have long provided more or less per
fect systems of State forest protection
on private lauds. In this respect Cali
fornia Is far behind.
If fire protection is provided and the
lumber men are taught more conser
vative methods, the forests will con
tinue to serve many useful functions
and give healthful employment to many
thousand men for an indefinite period.
If not regulated, the magnificent for
ests of the State will soon be replaced
by bare slopes of worthless chaparral;
tne rivers will be dry in summer and
ragina; Hoods in winter, and the agri
cultural and other related interests
will suffer bÂ»yond measure in conse
quence.
The bill, recommended by the Bu
reau of Forestry, provides for the be
ginning of a forest systÂ«m which will,
through education, fire preventive laws
and a corps of trained forest officers,
make the forest wealth of California
a permanent and priceless heritage.

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 16.â Senator
Broughton's bill providing that where
in the trial of any case involving the
sale, keeping or disposition of liquors
the defendant is found guilty of violat
ing any State, county, or municipal law
it shall be the duty of the court to or
der the destruction of the liquor, was
beaten in the upper house this morning
by a vote of 20 to 9. The vote on the
bill was preceded by a warm debate,
but Senators Shortridge and Keane
pointed out so clearly that the bill
might result in the ruin of any saloon
man who should happen to meet with
the displeasure of Home official with a
pull that a majority stood against the
measure and snowed it under. Ander
son gave notice of reconsideration,
however, and the bi'>! will come up
again to-morrow, though it is appar
ently beaten beyond the possibility of
revival.
The Senate this morning passed a
resolution introduced by Shortridge
granting to Governor Pardce the right
to absent himself from the State at,any
time he desires for a period of more
than sixty days. It is understood that
the resolution was introduced to give
the Governor an opportunity to make
an extended tour of the north during
the Lewis and Clark Exposition.
The Senate also passed a resolution
providing for night sessions during the
rest of the remaining legislative days.
<;ha\ite at foi.som.
Two bills involving a great problem
were introduced this afternoon by
Senator Cogglns. Last evening at the
meeting of the Board of Prison Direc
tors with the Senate Committee on
Finance and the Assembly Committee
on Ways and Moans it was announced
that the road rock at the FolsorrT pris
on is about exhausted and that within
a year the convicts at that institution
will be idle unless some provision is
rr^de that will permit of the quarrying
and sale of the granite that is avail
able at the institution. As the law now
stands the State Is prohibited from us
ing the granite except for the erection
of prison buildings and bridges and
culverts of State, county and district
roads. Should the appropriation for
the erection of new cells and walls at
San Quentin and Folsom go through
the convicts can be employed for about
five years, but at the end of this time
the condition that prevails to-day wtyl
again confront the prison officials.
This problem will be solved if the
Dills introduced by Coggins pass. One
provides for the repeal of the act pro
hibiting tlit dressing by convicts and
the sale of Folsom granite, the other
for the repeal of the act prohibiting the
sale of convict manufactured articles.
It is probable that the bills will be op
posed by labor and other organizations,
but, say the Prison Director*, work
must be found for the convicts or all
efforts to reform them will fail.
Senator Lynch introduced a bill this
afternoon providing for the appropria
tion of $50,000 for the establishment of
a California State irrigation school and
experiment farm in Monterey County.
Senator Markey introduced a bill
making it a misdemeanor for any per
son, firm or corporation engaged in
business as a merchant to falsely ad
vertise goods tor sale or to seek to
make purchasers accept inferior goods
upon the false statement that they are
superior in quality to those advertised.
The agitation against the use of the
repeating or "pump" gun in the pur
suit <>f game again found expression
this afternoon in a bill introduced by
Nelson of Sun Francisco making the
use of this arm a misdemeanor. An
ordinance of similar purport enacted by
an interior county was recently de
clared unconstitutional.
PRIZE FIGHT BILL.
Senator Ralston's anti-prizefight "bill |
was amended in the Senate this after
noon so as to eliminate the objection
able feature, which provided that any
amateur association giving sparring '
exhibitions must belong to the Ama- !
teyr Athletic Union of America. As ]
the bill now stands exhibitions may be
given by any person or corporation,
providing that no admission fee is
charged; that the contestants use
. eight-ounce gloves and that the contest
does not extend over a period of fif
teen minutes. If the bill is passed as
amended it will mean death to profes
sional pugilism in California.
Goodrich's Assembly bill, prohibiting
the devise by a testator of more than
one-third of his property to any char
itable institution, again came up in the
Senate this afternoon on reconsidera
tion, and was again defeated.
Lumley's bill to prevent travelers car
rying concealed weapons without per
mit of the authorities of each county
in which they may stay was defeated.
The Senate to-night passed a batch
of code revision bills, the revisions
being based on technical defects in the
code pointed out by^ decisions of the
Supreme Court.

their form of government, or the despoilment
of their territory under any disguise.
But, short of this, when the question is one
of a money claim, the only way which re
mains finally to collect it Is a blockade or
bombardment or the seizure of the custom
houses, and this means, as has been said
above, what is in effect a possession, even
though only a temporary possession, of Ur
rltory.
lhe United States then becomes a party in
interest, because undÂ»r th<> Monroe doctrine It
cannot see any European power seize and per
manently occupy the territory In one of these
republics; and yet such seizure of territory,
disguised or undisguised, may eventually offer
the only way in which the power in question
can collect any debts unless there is interfer
ence on the part of the United States.
One of the difficult and increasingly compli
cated : problems which , often arise in Santo
Domingo grows out of the violations of con
tracts and concessions, sometime* Improvl
dently granted, , with : valuable privileges and
exemptions stipulated upon for grossly inade
quate , considerations - which were burdensome
to the 'State and which are not infrequently
disregarded and violated by the governing au
thorities. Citizens of the United States and of
other Governments* holding these concessions
and contracts appeal to their respective Gov
ernments â  for active protection and interven
tion. Except for arbitrary wrong cone or sane
tioned by superior authority to persons or to
vested property rights, the United States Gov
ernment, following I its : traditional . u<Â»age In
such rases, aims to go no further than the
mere use of its good : of flees, a measure which
frequently -proven Ineffective. On the other
hand, there are Governments which do some
times take- energetic action for the protection
of their subjects In the enforcement of con
tractural claims, and thereupon - American
concessionaires, â¢ supported- by - powerful influ
ences, make loud appeal to the United States
Government In similar cases for similar action.
Th<-y complain â¢ that In , the actual posture
of affairs their valuable properties are prac
tically, confiscated, -that American â¢ enterprise
Is paralyzed and that unless they are fully pro
tected, even by the enforcement of their merely
ccntractural rights. It means the abandonment
to the subjects \of other . Governments of thÂ»
interests of * American -commerce â  and . trade
throurh the Â«nrrlflee of their investment b'
excessive taxes imposed In violation r>f contract
nnl by other devf'-es and' the Â«-v-rifl,-Â»Â» Â' t|rÂ»
output of their mines and other industries and
even .of their railway and snipping Interests
which thÂ»y have established in connection with
the exploitation of their concessions. Thus the
attempted solution of the complex problem by
the ordinary method* of diplomacy reacts In
juriously unon the United States Government
itself and :in a measure parplyzea the" action
of the .'executive in the direction of a sound
and consistent policy. â¢
AMFRICAX TRADE SIKFKRS.
The United States Government is embar

As a method of solution of the complicated
problem, arbitration lias become nugatory. In
asmuch as In the condition of Its finances an

its payment is secured by the pledge of at

This pledge is ineffectual without actual de

This situation again reacts injuriously upon
the relations of the United States with other
notions. For when *n award and such se
curity are thus obtained in the case of. thÂ«
Santo Domingo Improvement Company some
fc reign Government complains that the award
conflicts with its rights as a creditor to some
portion of these revenues under an alleged
prior pledge; and stUl other governments com
plain that an award In any considerable sum,
secured by pledges of. the oustoms revenue, la
prejudicial to the payment of their equally
meritorious claims out of the ordinary rev
enues; and thus controversies are begotten be
tween the United States and other creditor
nations because of the apparent of
some of their claims, which m.ty be just or
may be grossly exaggerated, but which the
United States Government CMaot inquire into
without giving grounds of offense to other
ffendly creditor nations. Still further illus
trations might easily be furnished of the hope
lessness Â«f the present situation growing out
of the social disorders and the bankrupt
finances of the Dominican republic where for
cniiMderable periods durins recent years the
bends of civil society have been practically
dissolved.
Under the accepted law of nations foreign
go\ernmentl are within their right, if they
choose to exercise It, when they actively in
tervene in support of the. contractural ilalma
o" their subjects. They sometimes exercise
this right and on account of commercial
rivalry there is a growing tendency on the
part of other governments more and more t>
aio diplomatically in the enforcement of the
chtims of their subjects. In view of the
dilemma in which the Government of the
United States is thus- placed it must either
adhere to Its usual attitude of non-interven
tion in such cases â an attitude proper un.ler
n<,:mal condition*, but one which. In this
particular kind of case, results to the dis
advantage of Its citizens In comparison with
those of other statesâ or else It must. In order
ti be consistent In Its policy, actively Inter
vene to protect the contracts and concessions
of Its citizens engaged >n agrituiture, com
merce and transportation In competition with
Urn subjects of other states. This course
would n nder the I'nited states the Insurer

' The Dominican debt owed to European cred
itors is about 522, 000,003 and of this sum over
$18.f1n0,000 is more or less formally . recog

Secretary of. State, setting forth thÂ» wrongs
and Intolerable delays to which they have been
subjected at the | hands of the successive gov
ernments of Santo Domingo and Intimating
that, unless. the Dominican Government should
receive some assistance from the United
States in the way of regulating Its finance*.
the creditor Governments of Europe would be
forced to resort to more effective measures of
ccmpulslon to secure the satisfaction of their
claims. â '- ' : â  â¢â  â¢ â¢ . . â¢
If the United States Government decline* to
take action and other foreign governments re
sort to action to v secure payment of their

to the decision -of The I- --i* tribunal In the
Venezuelan caws, to. the 'ferential payment
of their claims; and this would absorb all th*-
E>ominican revenues and â¢ would be' a virtual
sacrifice of all American, claims and Interest
outstanding. If, moreover, any such action
should be taken by them, the only method to
amendment changing the laws cover
ing sessions of the Legislature, report
ed at a caucus of the Republican mem
bers of the Assembly this evening. Its
report suggested a ninety-day session,
a total expense per day of $600 and $10
a day as the pay of members, the ses
sion to open upon the date now fixed.
It afterward developed that the ninety
day proposition was made merely that
the members of the caucus might have
plenty of room for amendment.
Dorsey moved an amendment pro
viding for an eighty-day session, and
during the squabble that followed a
motion to adjourn was carried, so the
ceucus resulted in nothing.

time which, would necessarily be required for
the payment of the obligations and unliquidated
claims. The United States Government couM
not Interfere to prevent such seizure and occu

J The ordtnary-resf)urces of diplomacy and In

to deal wisely and effectively with thÂ» situa

only toe met by organizing Its finances on a
sound basis and by placing the custom
houses beyond the temptation of Insurgent
chieftains. Either we must abandon our duty
under our traditional policy toward the Do
minican people: who aspire to a republican
form of government, while they are actually
drifting Into a condition of permanent anarchy.

Whatever the outcome of the dispute
between Kuropatkin and Grippenberg,
it is certain that the Emperor is fret

that General Sakharoff would succeed

CAPTAIN WINS
PRETTY BRIDE
Mariner Arthur E. Knights
Successfully Woos Miss
Vallance of New York
TEX DAYS OF COURTSHIP
Wealthy Seafarer Makes a
Wedding Present of Thirty
Thousand Dollar Cheek
A few days of ardent wooing won for
Captain Arthur E. Knights, a retired
and wealthy English mariner, a hand
some bride. Then days ago a
thought of marriage was as j
far from the captain's mind as
are the stars from the deepest
recesses of old Nentune's ocean cav
erns. But a week ago he met a hand
some woman from New York, and a
hurried courtship ended yesterday in a '
happy union. The wedding might have â 
been a church affair, attended with all !
the pomp of matrimonial functions, j
but the bride willed the contrary and
the nuptials were quietly celebrated.
The bride was Miss Aymer L. Val
lance, a niece of Mrs. Bloodgood, one
of Gotham's 400. As an orphan child i
she was reared by her grandmother, !
and recently came to San Francisco to â 
visit old friends. Some years ago Cap
tain Knights retired from active sea
service and has since amassed a for- |
tune in Shanghai, where his married
daughter by a former wife now lives.
Recently he came to San Francisco and
invested considerable money, and final
ly selected a handsome home at 1775
Broadway, where he was figuring on ,
living out the balance of his days in
peace.
It was while engaged in furnishing i
his new abode in a sumptuous manner
that fate brought him into social con
tact with Miss Vallance and suddenly
developed within him a desire for com
panionship. In his blunt manner he
proposed to his new acquaintance. She
at first resisted his entreaties. The
captain was, however, persistent and
finally the young woman yielded and a
date for the wedding was set. Miss
Vallance had been living at the Palace
Hotel for several days, and it was there
that she confided her secret to a friend.
Miss Jennie Gillisple of New York. who.
with Attorney John Bourdett, were the
only witnesses to yesterday's ceremony.
Immediately after the wedding the
bridal party partook of breakfast at
the St. Francis Hotel and then went to
the Broadway home, where the happy
husband presented his bride with a
check for $35,000, her wedding dowry,
and then joined with her in preparing
cablegrams and dispatches to relatives
advising them of their romantic mar
riage. Captain and Mrs. Knights will
remain at their Broadway home for
several weeks and then make a tour of
the world.

Please Take Notice.
From an advertisement appearing
in the Chronicle of a week ago last
J Sunday, over the signature of an old
| established music house of this city,
we note the following paragraph:
"The opportunity of a lifetime for per-
I sons wishing a genuine KNABE piano to
secure one at a substantial satin* from
regular prices.
"Cut prices are often offered on cheap.'
and even on medium grade pianos, but
an opportunity to secure a hlya grmdm
; piano at anything below regular prices is
I rare indeed. It is only on some such oc-
: casion as this, and such occasions arÂ» In
j frequent. In fact, no such condition of
affairs has ever before prevailed in our
experience, and we have been in the mu-
sic business ; in San Francisco continu-
ously for fifty-four years." .
Now, In a friendly way, we wish to
j take exceptions to that broad state-
| ment, for it will be remembered our
I house â firm of Clark Wise & Co.
âmade a tremendous sacrifice sale of
"Weber" pianos not over sixty days
ago. cutting the price on the various
uprights of that make all the way
from $163 to 260 below the retail
; prices for same, even as they are reg-
ularly retailed for right in the city of
New York, where they are built: and 1
. the Weber has always been considered
a high grade pianoâ at least it was so
; considered when built by Albert We-
! ber. and while he was on earth it was
â  played in public concerts, and in-
[ dorsed by many noted pianists, and
, even since the "Webers" ceased to
I build the piano, it has been indorsed
by some celebrated singers; therefore
we consider the Weber a high grade
piano still, and we believe the musical
public so considers it.
We did not claim that the Weber
cost as much. money wholesale at the
factory as the Knube. or the Stein-
way. or the Everett, or the Chicker-
! ing; or that it stood so prominently
j before the musical world at the pres-
I ent time as several of the great artis-
â  tic â leaders like the Stein
I Knabe, and . Everett, wrfich are being
i so prominently played in public con-
j certs before the world each season.
â¢ by such great and celebrated pianists
jas Paderewski. d'Albert, Gabrilo-
i witsch, Reisnauer, and others â but we
! did say that the Weber piano cost a
j lot of money, and that it was worth
â¢ a lot of money; and that It was a
I strictly high grade piano.
; We believed then, and we believe
} now, that the Weber is a high grade
, piano; and we know that we made as
1 great a cut. or sacrifice on high grade
: pianos in our ' Weber sale of two
i months ago if Weber is a high- grade
piano) as was ever made on high
1 grade pianos anywhere.
And now comes along this old es-
â  tablished house with its ad. and says
' that low grade pianos, and sometimes
medium grade pianos are offered in
cut price, or sacrifice sales, but never,
in their experience of fifty-four years
in the piano business in this city, have
they before known of high - grade-
'pianos being sold at cut prices in a
special sale till they then and ' there
' themselves offered some "Knabes *
} that way â 'Not in fifty-four years,"
hah! and since our great sacrifice
: sale of "Webers" for spot cash, it
hasn't been fifty-four â We!!, a
I year Is but a day with some people.
! We feel somewhat aggrieved at tha
! above paragraph in their ad, from the
i fact that we don't know whether they
| mean to reflect on our veracity, integ-
: rity or judgment. It may be that their
whole ad is a joke, and that it don't
I mean anything, but if it does, it must
I mean one of two â either that
we didn't sell Webers low enough in
; that sale to.be considered a cut price
i sale (and that reflects on both our in-
j tegrity and veracity, for we said we
did. â and we got the money s3B7 â
! and that ought to be low enough for
! a Weber to be quite a special sale),
â  or, it means that the Weber is only a
"medium grade" piano, and that re-
flects on our judgment, for we said it
was high grade; but. if our judgment
should be at fault in that respectâ in
regard to the Weber quality
that the Weber ie in reality only a
! medium grade piano after all, then
we are more glad than ever that they
i have the "Weber" agency now, and
' that we have " the "Everett."
The moat charitable view we can.
I take of the above objectionable para-
' graph in their ad is, that it was a typo-
: graphical error â in there somehow
through mistake â¢in the printing of-
â and . giving them the benefit of
the doubt.' we would suggest that they
cut it out; for we have about twenty
new and beautiful Webers on hand
â sixteen of which came in a car-
load ten days after our great Weber
sale was started, and which were not
i unboxed till about two weeks ago, and â 
\ which we are liable at any time to of-
i fer quite low enough to satisfy any
future agent - for the Weber that It's
more than a "special sale" we are
making, and one . not likely, to be for-
gotten in fifty-four days.

a victory for their side, but in other
quarters the result was regarded as a

That Hyde had a majority of the

this connection.

DICKENS RELICS
WILL BE SOLD
Interesting Notes Penned by
the Famous Novelist to
Be Auctioned in London
WHISTLER EXHIBITION
Leigh Hunt's House Is Soon
to Be Torn Down to Make
Room for New Buildings
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 16.â Some of the most
genuinely interesting letters of Charles
Dickens in existence at the present time
will be sold at auction In London this
month. They were written by the au
thor of "Pickwick" to Georgre Catter
mole, who illustrated "The Old Curios
ity Shop" and "Barnaby Rudge." Cat
termole was one of Dickens' favsVite
illustrators, as well as his close friend.
The letters show what detailed sug
gestions Dickens was in the habit of
making regarding the pictures for his
novels. The following one, written by
Dickens to Cattermole in 1841, refers to
a drawing for "Barnaby Rudge":
Can you do for me by Saturday evening? I
know the time U short, but I think the subject
will suit you, and I am greatly pressed. A
party of rioters (with Hugh and Simon TappÂ«r
fli conspicuous among them) in old John Wil
lrt's bar â turning: the liquor taps to their own
advantage â sÂ»mashine buttles â cutting down thr
prnv* of lemonsâ KlttinK astride on casks â
driijkitiK out of the best i iinchbowls â eating: the
groat cheese â smoking sacred pipes, etc., etc.
John Willet. fallen backward in his chair, re
garding them with a stupid horror, and <iuite
alont* among Utah, with none of the Maypole
i ur-tomers at his back. It's in your way, and
you'll do it a, hundred times better than I can
Euggest it to you, I know.
Evidently he did; for in another let
ter to Oattermole, dated August 19,
IS4I, Dirkens says: "John Willet's bar
is noble." Then he outlines another
"Barnaby Rudge" picture as follows:
When Hugh and a small body of the rioters,
cut off from the Warren unbeknown to their
pals, they forced Into a ramshackle postchaise
Dolly Varden and Emma Haredale, and bore
them away with all possible rapidity, one of
their company driving and the rest running be
side the ohaisw. climbing up behind,
on the top, lighting the way with their torches,
etc.. etc. If you un express the women inside
wlthoui sbowtag themâ as by a fluttering veil.

half-cloced window- so much the better. Mr.
Tappertit stands on the steps, which arc partly
down. and. hanging on to the window with one
hand and extending the other with great majes
ty, addresses a few words of encouragement
to the driver and attendants.
Cattermole's drawings for "The Old
Curiosity Shop" drew the highest sort
of praise from Dickens. He wrote:
It i!Â» impossible for me to tell you how greatly
I am charmed with those beautiful pictures, in
which the whole feeling and thought and ex
pression of the little story ip rendered to the
gratification of my inmost heart; and on which
you have lavished those amazing resources of
yours with a power at which I fairly wondered
when I eat down yesterday before them. 1
t.iok them to Mac. straightway, in a cabâ and
it would have done you good if you could have
BBSS and h.*ard them. You can't think how
moved he was hy the old man in the church,
or how proud I was to have chosen It before he
s;tw tho drawings. You arc such a queer fel
low, and hold yourself so much aloof, that I
am afraid to say half I would say touching my
grateful admiration. So you shall Imagine the
rest.
These letters are part of a valuable
collection of literary and musical relics
of the late Julian Marshall. It includes
one letter by Matthew Arnold and two
by Robert Browning, not to mention
manuscripts by Handel, Bach, Haydn,
Donizetti, Gounod. Spohr, Gluck and
Chopin. One of the Browning letters
is addressed to an amateur poet, who
wrote asking his advice about publish
ing a volume of verse. One paragraph
runs:
It sounds strange and almost sad to me that
I should be imagined of authority In thiE kind,
I wno for years could not get a line printed
except at my own expense, and I began half
a century ago. or more.
KIPLIXG AND FAMILY.
One of Rudyard Kipling's fellow pas
sengers on his recent voyage to the
Cape says of the novelist:
Kipling made a, delightful impress on every
one on board. He was cheery and courteous,
and not at all averse to conversation. â  He
didn't display a great deal of energy, and he
obviously avoided moet of the games played on
ship, though once or twice he took a hand at
quoits witlf Mrs. Kipling. Generally he was
Ilanking the deck, talking or sitting quietly
reading. Sometimes he wrote in the smoke
room. He smoked pipes and cigarettes and
never played cards, though he admitted cas
ually on one occasion that he had "heard of
bridge." One niomlng he was seen playing
with one of the new pneumatic toy motor cars
and evidently extracting a good deal of
amusement from the manipulation of its steer
ing apparatus.
But on the whole his chief car* seemed to
center on his wife and children, and when he
â was not with the former he could generally
be found playing with the latter, chatting
gaily with them and thoroughly entering into
tbelr enjoyment. On Christmas day he joined
vigorously in a game of "follow my leader,"
and on one occasion he was observed taking
Ice cream from the dinner table to his children
In their cabins. Miss Klsie Kipling, aged 8. is
the elder and her brother John Is a year
younger. They are both pretty good children,
with good features, a happy and judicious
blend of mother and father.
Cosmo Hamilton, known in America
chiefly by means of his entertaining
magazine stories, is having a run of
popularity over here at present. He
has just been made editor of that staid
and fashionable unillustrated weekly,
"The World;" his musical comedy,
"The Catch of the Season," is having
a remarkably successful run; he has
more orders for plays than he could
turn out even if he w,ere two or three
Cosmo Hamiltons; and he has Just fin
ished a society novel entitled "DukVs
Son," which is to be published imme
diately. It deals with the fashionable
business of making a living out of
cheating at bridge.
IN MEMORY OF WHISTLER.
The coming Whistler Memorial Kx
hibilJon In London, which will open
on Washington's Birthday, promises to
be an uncommonly complete and rep
resentative collection of the American
artist's work in every style. Prac
tically every Whistler picture of note
will be on view, excepting the portrait
of Lady Archibald Campbell, with
which the trustees of the Philadelphia
Museum are not allowed by law to
part. The International Society of
Sculptors, Painters anl Graveurs,
which is organizing this exhibition, and
of which Whistler was the first presi
dent, appreciates greatly the generous
treatment which it has received from
owners of the artist's works the world
over â Americas in particular.
Perhaps the picture which will have
the greatest Interest for connoisseurs
will be that known as "The Large
White Girl," owned by Whittemore of
New Haven. This is the picture which
was painted by Whistler in the early
sixties and rejected at the Salon in
1863, bnt later shown In the Salon dcs
Refuses side by side with work by
Manet, Fantin Latour and others. It
went to the United States soon after.
Other famous works of Whistler at the
exhibition will be "The Artist's
Mother"â loaned by the Luxembourg
SENATE COMMITTEE AIMS
BLOW AT PRESIDENT.
ANTI - ADMINISTRATION BILL
IN order to strike at the President, the United States Senate Committee on
Interoceanic Canals authorized Senator Kittredge to prepare a bill curtailing
the chief executive's authority in the canal zone. This measure was pre
sented yesterday, simultaneously with the passage by the House of the Mann
bill, embodying the President's views. The House yesterday, Republicans and
Democrats concurring, bitterly rebuked the Senate for exceeding its rights in
amending the agricultural appropriation bill.
IGNORES HOUSE
CANAL MEASURE
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â Without
[ waiting for the Mann canal bill to come
from the House, the Senate Committee
on Interoceanic Canals authorized Sen
| ator Kittredge to prepare a new bill for
: the committee and"^ introduce it in the
Senate, which was done to-day. The
committee has been sittingfor several
weeks, having before it the Mann bill
: as originally reported in the House and
the amendments reported on Febru- j
. ary 1.
The Mann bill provides specifically :
! for the repeal of that part of the canal ,
; act authorizing the appointment of the
; Isthmian Canal Commission and fixing
: its duties and powers. This section is j
eliminated from the Senate bill and the
entire question is covered in the first
j section, which extends the present canal j
| act. The bill introduced by Senator ;
I Kittredge follows out practically all j
j the remaining provisions of the Mann i
i bill, but provides also a number of new j
i features. .
One important change is in the sec
tion which extends the authority now
enjoyed by the President for the con
| trol of the canal zone. The Senate bill
I extends this authority until the end of
the next regular session of Congress,
while the Mann bill provided for an ex- I
j tension until the end of the next Con
i gress.
Another new feature of the Senate
bill is as follows:
All income at any time received by the
' United States from rentals, dividends or oth
! erwise in respect of any property now pos-
s essed or hereafter acquired in connection with
{ the canal or railroad works shall be turned
â  Into and credited to the fund for the con-
I Btruction of said canal and works.
Two new sections are added, \>ne be
! inp: as follows:
That all laws affecting imports, goods, wares
i and merchandise and entry of persons Into tlie
, I'nited States from foreign countries shall ap
; ply to articles, goods, wares and merchandise
! and persons coming from the canal zone, isth
: muÃ of Panama, and seeking entry into any
State or Territory of the United States or the
i District of Columbia.
The other provides for the deposit of
[ not to exceed $1,500,000 with a bank
i having a fiscal agent on the isthmus of
i Panama in order that there may be a
sufficient supply of money to meet the
| necessary expenses of the Government.

PLANS TO PLACE BMME

Evil Scheme Discovered In Connection
With Pawnbroker Guilty of
Receiving Stolen Goods. ,
NEW YORK, Feb. 16. â Edward M.
Harlam, one of the wealthiest pawn
brokers In the city, has pleaded guilty
to an indictment charging hinf with
being a receiver of stolen goods. He
was remanded to prison to await sen
tence.
Affidavits are said to be in posses
sion of the District Attorney showing
that some person had offered to pay
two city detectives $10,000 each and
another man $5000 if they would ar
range evidence which would have
shifted the case toward an innocent
person, an ignorant foreigner having
been selected. In the latter's rooms
it was proposed to place a quantity
of stolen silk, some of which figures
in the case.
ANNOUNCEMENT MADE
OF ROYAL ENGAGEMENT
Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to
Wed a Niece of the German
Empress.
COBURG, Feb. 16. â The betrothal
is announced of the Duke of Saxe-
Coburg and Gotha to the Princess
Victoria, eldest daughter of Duke
Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein-Son
derburg-Glucksburg. The Princess is
a niece of the German Empress, while
the bridegroom-elect is a nephew of
King Edward of England.
authorities, who rarely make such a
concession â the "Carlyle" from the
Corporation Gallery in Glasgow, and
the "Sarasate" from the Carnegie Gal
lery, Pittsburg. Most of the gems of
the magnificent collection of Whistler
etchings owned by Howard Mansfield
of New York will also be on view.
LANDMARK DOOMED.
Still another of London's landmarks
is doomed, and this time one well
known to Americans â Leigh Hunt's
house in. Kensington. The house, which
stands in Edwarries Square, is to be
torn down to make room for a proposed
flat building. Here Leigh Hunt lived
for eleven years, which were the most
prosperous, the most industrious, and
the most happy of his life. Up to 1840,
when he moved to Edwardes Square,
Hunt lived at No. 4 Upper Cheyne Row
in Chelsea, where he had Carlyle as his
near neighbor and friend, and in these
days the author of "Abou Ben Adhem"
was harassed constantly bji money
troubles.
Soon after his change of residence,
however, Hunt's annoyances were
brought to an end by the grant to him
of a pension of $1000 a year from the
Civil List and the receipt of an annuity
of $600 from Shelley's son. "A heaven
fall," he called it, "one of the wishes
of my beloved friend, Shelley." At the
Edwardes Square house, Hunt did most
of his best work, including "Palfrey,"
the "Jar of Honey," the "Old Court
Suburb," the "Stories From the Italian
Poets," much of his autobiography,
anti a good deal of miscellaneous work.
HOUSE PASSES
THE MANN BILL
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16â The Mann
bill to provide a government for the
canal zone was passed by the House
to-day. The bill gives all the right of
government of the canal zone to the
President until the end of the next
Congress, but provides that the gov
ernment shall be so exercised as to pro
tect the inhabitants in the free enjoy
ment of their liberty, prosperity and re
ligion. It abolishes the Isthmian Canal
Commission and places the work of the
construction of the canal in the hands
of the President and such persons as
he may appoint and employ. It does
not undertake to determine whether the
canal shall be constructed as a sea
level or a lock-level waterway.
While the bill abolishes the canal
commission so far as the law Js con
cerned, it authorizes the President to
retain the commission as a commission
or its individual members as consult
ing engineers if he shall so desire. ,
Authority to condemn 3031 shares of
stock in the Panama Railroad now in
the hands of private owners is carried
in the bill, and the President is author
ized, when full and complete control of
the railroad is acquired, to operate it
through such persons as he may select
in order that the road may be used,
as far as Is necessary, as a part of the
construction work on the canal.

BITTER REBUKE
TO THE SENATE
WASHINGTON. Feb. IÂ«.â The House
to-day entered an emphatic protest
against the action of the Senate
amending the agricultural appropria
tion bill so as to eliminate the draw
back feature of the Dingley tariff act
affecting wheat. Both PaynÂ« of New
York, the majority leader, and Wil
liams of Mississippi, thÂ« minority
leader, urged that the bill bo tent back
to the Senate.
Payne said he did not intend to dis
cuss the merits of the Senate amend
ment, whether i< was wise or un
wise. He was loudly applauded by
both Republicans and Democrats when
he asserted that the main question was
"whether that clause in the constitu
tion which declares that all bills for
raising revenue shall originate in the
House shall be cherished by this House
8Â« one of its privileges." The ques
tion, he said, also was "whether we
will resent any infringement from any
source of that clause of the constitu
tion."
Williams, the minority leader, alluded
to the action of the Senate "in engag
ing a strenuous effort to prevent a real
or supposed attack by the executive â
a usurpation in the opinion of the
Senate upon its 'function and dignity," â 
and said it was a peculiarly inappro
priate time for the Senate to attempt
"to make a plain, palpably obvious and
aggressive attack upon the dignity of
the House."
The resolution returning th<- bill
as amended to the Senate was adopted
on a yea and nay voteâ 26l to sâ those
voting against it being Davis and Olm
stead of Minnesota. Adams of Wiscon
sin, Marshall of North Dakota and
Jones of Washington, all Republicans.

The Secretary announces that all
officers of the reserve service trans

forester. It is also announced that
under an order signed by the Presi
dent on December 17, 1904, the whole
forest reserve service is classified and
placed under the civil service law.
The Secretary further states the pol
icy of the department will be for the
protection of the permanent resources
of the reserve and "that the wood,
water and forage thereof shall be
conserved and wwely used for the
benefit of the homebuilder first of
all."
He concludes his letter by saying
that questions of conflicting interests
must be decided on the principle of
greatest good to the greatest number
in the long run and that the adminis
tration of each reserve is to be left
very largely in the hands of the local
officers under the eye of thoroughly
trained and competent inspectors.

did he overlook; not a weak spot in
the defense escaped him. He reviewed
link after link of the chain of circum
stantial evidence that points to the
guilt of the youthful Auburn suspect.
He told the jurore of the behavior of
young Weber toward the members of
family; how the mother, Mrs.
Weber, with the love of a mother for
her first born, excused his Idiosyncra
sies and bore with him in silence that
the world should not know that her
heart was broken. When during the
course of his argument Attorney Ham
ilton, wiih his hand raised on high and
with voice quivering with emotion,
said. "I thank God his father is
dead, that his flster is dead, that his
little brother is dead, for they will not
be compelled to take the stand and
swear That this boy Is the murderer of
Mary Weber," there was hardly a dry
eye in the courtroom. When the at
torney, in a husky voice, declared that
Adolph Weber probably shot the
mother who bore him, the woman at
-whose knees he had first lisped his
childish prayers, as she knelt and cried
to him, "Dolphy, Dolphy, mercy for
your mother,' the women in the big
courtroom sobbed aloud and the men
hid their faces that the tears that filled
their eyes should not be seen.
"Gentlemen of the Jury," pleaded
Hamilt in. "give him the same mercy
that he gave to his mother as she knelt
before him begging for her life."
During the attorney's argument
Weber squirmed uneasily in his seat.
etonalty he would raise his eyes,
only to drop Umn when they encoun
tered the gaze of Hamilton or the spec
s. who, struck by the attorney's
awful sincerity, kept their eyes on the
s*d youth, expecting that the
ng words would bring forth a sign
â¢ row, a display- of feeling or even
interest. They were disappointed. But
is movements about in
hair and the occasional lifting of
pel M*. thr prisoner gave no sign
that the words of the attorney were
saere to him than a Fourth of July
.â¢is much.
WOMKN IV BLACK.
When Hamilton closed his argument
-.Â« immediately surrounded by the
men, women and children of Auburn.
They all wanted to grasp his hand. In
the midst of his triumph two women,
clad in black and heavily veiled, came
â¢1 him. They were Mrs. Snowden
and Mr.=. Hess, sisters of the murdered
woman. The crowd made way for the
two women, who were sobbing plteous
ly Without uttering a word they
efl the hands of the young attor
ney and silently shook them. The hand
clasps were mute evidence of the feel
ings of the two suffering women and a
wish that the jury would show
Adolph Weber the mercy he showed
Their sister.
The courtroom was crowded with the
leading business men of the town as
well as the most prominent women of
the place. Business in the main part
at the otty was practically suspended
during this session of the court.
The morning session opetied up with
H. E. Klessig, a gunsmith from Sac
ramento, on the stand. He substan
tiated his testimony of the day before.
H:f worth as an expert, however, was
â hova when the bullets he used to ex
periment with were handed him. He
was unable to identify them.
Six witnesses from San Francisco
were on hand to testify to the good
character of Henry Carr, the pawn
broker, who says he sold a revolver to
young Weber. They all swore his
character was of the best. The testi
mony of Max Abrahams and Jacob S.
LÂ»ehrberger as to Carr's character was
admitted. That of Sam Nathan was
ruied out. The testimony of Nathan
Rotk", G. W. Guppy and Henry John
ston on the same subject was declared
admissible.
George Brinkerhoff, porter of the
Aerial Flats of San Francisco, who
was friendly with Weber during the
latter's visit to San Francisco last
summer, was also a witness. He said
that Weber always wore & dark blue

overcoat and a black hat when he went
out In the evenings. He never saw him
wear a light hat or a gray overcoat. j
The witness declared he had never j
gone out with Weber to buy a revolver. j
The defense introduced a pair of j
brass knuckles and a blackjack in or- \
der that the Jury might see what these
articles were. j
DEFENDANT RECALLED. !
Adolph Weber was again summoned
to the stand by Attorney Johnson. "Do
you know Chester Fowler and George
Brinkerhoff?" asked the attorney. .
"Yes, sir," said Weber.
"D"id you ever go out in the evening
in San Francisco with any young men
except these two?" i
"No, sir." was the reply.
"Did you hear Edna Fulton speak to j
you at your home on the night of the
fire?"
"No. sir," said the defendant. I
"On that night did you hear some one
say to you, 'Where are the folks?' "
Yes." answered Weber. "I said they
were here when I left."
The defendant was not cross-exam
ined.
A. J. Hulen, a teamster, testified that
on the night of the fire he was driving
into town with a Mr. Fellows. As they
reached the Bernhart crossing, he said,
he looked at his watch. It was 6:30
o'clock. He did not hear any scream
from the Weber home, as his team
made too much noise. He stated posi
tively that It was- 6:35 or 6:36 when he
came to the corner of Sacramento and
High streets.
The prosecution next introduced R.
F. Glenn, who was In Ophlr with F.
L.utz and Charles Vaughn when George
Ruth arrived there. Lutz and Vaughn
swore last week when on the witness
stand that Ruth had stated Ip their
presence that he had not carried little
Earl Weber from the blazing house â
that he had carried^ out the "old wom
an." Glenn to-day testified that he was
present when this conversation took
place and that he heard Ruth positive
ly declare to every one who asked him
that he did carry out the boy.
The afternoon session was opened up
by the prosecution calling John Adams,
the administrator of the estate of Ju
lius Weber. General Webb stated that
he wished to prove by the testimony of
Adams that there was no will and that
the estate would go to the prisoner.
HAMILTON'S ARGUMENT.
At 2 o'clock Attorney Hamilton be
gan his argument. In part he said:
The prosecution is here to enforce the law. j
and. headed by Attorney General Webb, has
endeavored to present to the jury â  clear and j
connected case of circumstantial evidence con- â¢
necting: the defendant here with tile murder of i
Mary Weber. â  Everything haÂ» been done to I
make th? chain of evidenc absolutely complete. '
The best endeavors of General Webb, the Dis- I
trict Attorney and Sheriff Keena have been ;
given to thf fulfillment of their duties. It now
rests with you. gentlemen of the Jury, to do
your part.
The defendant; Adolph Weber. is presumed
to be Innocent until he Is proven guilty. He
is entitled to rights, particularly the right to
be tried by a jury of twelve impartial men.
The evidence here produced proves, to my
mind, that he is guilty of the terrible crime
with which he is charged. The attorneys for
the defense have said everything in his behalf.
Is there any one In the world who can come
forward to prove his innocence?
I have gone into this case for a share
of the boarded i fortune left by Julius Weber
that stands behind the defense. I am in this
case by the courtesy of District Attorney Rob
inson and General' Webb. lam here to speak
for the laws of the State, law? that must be
obeyed. This trial Is conducted entirely on
the basis of circumstantial evidence, evidence
that I deem strong enough to convict the de
fendant of this horrible crime.
I thank God that his father Is dead, that
his eiFter Bertha is dead and that his brother
Earl is dead for they will not be compelled
to come to this court. to swear that this boy
Is the murderer of Mary Weber. .1 appeal to
the laws of the land and I appeal to you.
Jurymen who love these laws, to see In this
case that the law Is carried out to the fullest
extent. This horrible crime transcends any
crime known In this country to-day.
No matter what may be the I result of this
trial to the defendant It is an important fact
to you that he is tried for his life. On the
: other side of the ' scales is his own mother.
The mother at whose knees he learned to pray
to his God. Talk about the angels, talk about
the promised land, there is on earth something
better than all these. > It is the affection and
thÂ« love of a mother. A mother's affection
on this earth Is better than what the Bible
t#lle us Is the promised land, j
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
In circumstantial evidenc* H is necessary to
establish that a crime has been committed.
This we can fully do. A little angel in thÂ«
shape of Frances Snowden left the Weber
family at B:30 on the evening of November
10, when they were all alive and well. She
had scarcely left that home when some one
entered there and murdered the whole family.
Who did this? The defense must put some
body into this case. They have suggested no
one.
This murderer knew the family well. He
â¢hot his father through the heart as he was
facing him; he shot his sister Bertha through
the heart as she was looking at him, and hÂ«
shot his mother aÂ« she wa? probably on her
knees crying "Dolphy, Dolphy, mercy, mercy,
for your mother." He struck his brother Earl
on the head as he was looking up at him.
Gentlemen of the jury, give him the same
mercy that he gave to his mother as she
knelt before him begging for her life.
The murderer left that house with his hands
sUined with blood. What waÂ» the first thing
for him to do? Wash his hands. This he did
at the American Hotel.
ThÂ« testimony of May Clark that he cam*
down Brewery lane about 6:30 is fully sub
stantiated by th<Â» testimony of Joseph Powell
Clarence Geear and Walter Crosby, each of
whom caw him about that time. The defens*
has cast a great reflection upon the name of
the murdered . Bertha Weber. They have
dragged that innocent girl's name Into the tes
timony they hay* offered in this court through
two Women cf 111 repute. Myrtle Hall and Lotfe
Smith the women through whose testimony they
tried to Impeach the statements of May Clark.
I do not f< r one moment believe that the head
counsel in this case brought forward this
story. It was Detective Green who went to
these abandoned women, and I believe he
placed in their mouths the words they came
here and falsely pwore to as words of truth.
If this defendant had one spark of manhood
he would have refused to allow this reflection
to be cast, on the good name of his sister and
allow that! good name to be dragged into the
court as that of a friend of May Oark.
Hamilton then went on with a care
ful recital of the evidence adduced at
thf> trial. He related how young
Weber had stated that he left his fam
ily alive' and well that evening, and In
a roundabout way went down town, re
maining in town until the fire h&ll
etruck. The testimony, said Hamilton,
proved conclusively that Weber did not
go this roundabout way, but went
straight down Brewery lane. He said:
When he arrived in front of his burning
home. instead "of going, to the. i front ' room,
where he. said his sister was when ~; he v left
he house, he went to the " dining-room. :â  a
room where . the family never sat, and there
effected an entrance.' for what" reason no 'one
knows.' This defendant then Jumped ; out the
dining-room window and - came to the â¢ steps
of. the front porch \ and there he allowed
strangers to * carry : out the mutilated remains
of those that should have been dearer, to i him

DENVER DOCTOR ON TRIAL
FOR MURDER OF HIS WIFE
Woman, Apparently Victim of Run
away Accident, Said to Have
Been Poisoned.
NEW LONDON, Mo., Feb. 16. â The
prosecution to-day began the intro
duction of evidence in rebuttal in the
case of Dr. T. Jones Watson of Den
ver, charged with the murder of his
wife. The defense closed its case by
placing Dr. Watson on the stand. He
declared the death of his wife was due
to an accident.
Mrs. Watson was killed while driv
ing in a buggy with her husband. The
prosecution claims that she was
poisoned and her body prepared tÂ«
bear out the hypothesis that she was
the victim of a runaway accident.
WORKMEN SERIOUSLY HURT
BY SULPHUR EXPLOSION
Believed That Four Will Die as the
Result of Accident in Brook

NEW YORK, Feb. 16. â Eight work
men were badly injured by an explo
sion of sulphur in the Brooklyn Sul
phur Works in Brooklyn to-day. The
firemen and policemen who brought
them out of the building were them
selves much affected by breathing the
sulphur fumes. At one time ten firemen
were lying on the sidewalk with
ambulance surgeons administering
restoratives. It is believed four of the
injured workmen will die.
The first explosion was quickly fol
lowed by a second and in a minute the
whole three-story building was in
flames.

than life itaelf and made no attempt tÂ» help
them.
What kind of man can he be? When he is
called upon the stand before this court he sits
in the witness chair with an expression of In
difference and contempt and says he did not
kill his family. He tells a falsehood and he
commits a perjury. If he was innocent he
would have gone to the very place in which
he left hla family that evening. But he did
not. It was Clarence Geear and George Ruth
who went into that burning home and dragged
the family from the flames. Now this de
fendant comes forward and tries to make a
hero of himself by saying. "I went into that
burning room and brought out my little
brother."
In all that crowd of hundreds of women and
frenzied men there was not one that saw
Adolph Weber on that porch or In 'that room.
The blood-curdling spectacle presented by the
removal of charred and bleeding bodies brought
no expression of sympathy from Adolph Weber,
but It sent & shudder of terror and horror
through the great crowd of spectators of that
awful sight.
If he was Innocent of thlÂ« crime Adolph
AVeber would have rushed to the side of his
relatives, but no, he kept away from them
He did not dare to go near them or dare to
look at them. He knew he had not the cour
age, so slunk away and sat beneath the little
magnolia tree.
The defense has tried to prove that Mary
Weber was alive when she was carried from
the burning building. Dr. Rooney has testified
that the bullet wounds would have caused her
death within fifteen minutes after they had
been Inflicted. If they had established thia
fact, Adolph Weber could not have been the
murderer of his mother. They failed to Â«how
thU. The testimony presented here yesterday
by J. F. Ulton and J. M. Prancla proved that
she was dead when taken from the house

CIVIL SERVICE
FINDS FRAUD
Strikes Name of I. M. Silver
From List of Eligibles
to Hold 3lunicipal Jobs
The Civil Service Commission last
night set aside the certification of
Isafah M. Silver of 563 Fell street, an
ordinary clerk employed in Tax Col
lector Smith's office. It was discovered
yesterday that Silver's examination
paper had been written by another
man. The examination was held June
15, 1900.
James A. Code, an experienced clerk
in Smith's office, notified Clerk Maher
of the Civil Service Commission yes
terday that he was informed that Sil
ver had never taken the examination
for the position which he occupied.
Code said, after seeing the papers pur
porting to have been written by Silver,
that he believed a man known as Jo
seph Devine, alias "Helny" Devine, had
passed the examination In Silver's
place.
The Grand Jury was informed' at the
same time regarding the case, and
Foreman Andrews and Expert Young
.of the Grand Jury were present at the
commission's meeting last night, mere
ly to bring the matter before the com
mission, they said.
Silver admitted that the examination
paper and the identification sheet were
not in his handwriting, but maintained
that he took the examination. The only
place where his writing appeared was
on the application blank. In view of
the marked discrepancies in the hand
writing Silver's name was stricken
from the eligible list of civil service
appointees and he will not be allowed to
take any examination for a municipal
position.
Silver has a suit In Judge Sloss'
court to-day to compel Tax Collector
Smith to show cause why he should
not be retained In his position as clerk.
He was ordered discharged by the
Civil Service Commission a week ago,
he being one of the last on the eligible
list and it being necessary on account
of a lack of work to lay off some of
the men in the Tax Collector's office.
Foreman Andrews believes the suit
Instituted by Silver was backed by
Smith, and that if Silver won out the
Tax Collector would discharge all the
civil service employes in his office and
substitute his own friends.
Silver's crime, which Is a misdemean
or, is barred from prosecution by the
statute of limitations, four years hav
ing elapsed since the fraud was com
mitted. His papers were passed through
an oversight by a board of examination
consisting of Judge J. V. Coffey. former
Mayor L. R. Ellert and Charles Bund
schu.

a Letter to Sacramento
Berkeley . Office San Francisco Call.
214S Center street. Feb. 16.
The member* of the Town and Gown
Club, an organization including many
of the most influential women in
Berkeley, made its influence manifest
last night, when at a meeting held in
the club rooms representatives of the
city government and improvement
clubs of the town gathered with the
ladies and took decisive action regard
ing the passage of a State law which
shall assist in procuring clean streets
for Berkeley and for other California
towns and cities as well.
The civic section of the Town and
Gown Club has concerned itself partic
ularly, in the past, with the question
of clean streets. Recently an invita
tion was sent to the improvement
clubs and city officials to confer with
the women regarding effective legisla
tion on the subject.
The conference was held last night.
Speeches were made by President
Rickard of the Board of Trustees. Vic
tor Robertson, president of the North
Berkeley Improvement Club, Trustee
Francis Ferrier, A. R. Frame. Mr.
Shaad and others. Mr. Rickard said
that clean streets always had been a
hobby of his, and he believed that
while popular agitation might create
sentiment in favor of clean highways,
a. State law was needed that would re
quire individual property owners to do
their part.
Mr. Rickard suggested that Assem
blyman Waste be asked to introduce
â¢ bill in the Legislature embodying
these ideas, and before the conference
ended the following letter was drafted
and adopted:
To the Honorable W. H. Waste, Faeramen- !
to: At a mass-meeting of citizens of Berkeley
hÂ»l<J this evening it was unanimously voted as
follows:
Resolved. That the Hon. W. H. Waste, our
representative in the Legislature be requested
to prepare a bill and urge Its adoption by
the Legislature of California, giving to mu
nicipalities the power to keep the streets in
order and clean the same and to levy a special
lax upon abutting property to cover the cost
of 'â tie.

POLICE BEGUN A SEARCH
Little Girl From a Northern
Tribe Wearies of Her Life
in the University Town
Berkeley Offlce San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Feb. 16.
The old-fashioned complaint of
home-sickness, emphasized by a com
mon case of quarrel, inspired little Liz
zie McCarey, a full-blooded Indian
maiden, to leave the home of her
' guardians in this city last night and
j begin a long tramp back to the reser-
I vetion.
Mr. and Mrs. M. Johnson, living at
I Dana and Derby streets, asked the po-
I lice to-day to assist in recovering the
j little Indian maiden. Marshal Kerns
: received a description of the girl and
wired the details to the police of Oak
land and San Francisco, where search
will be made for Miss McCarey. She is
about 12 years old, slender, black
haired, wearing short skirts and reveal
ing in her features her racial origin.
Those acquainted with the "child" of
the forest," however, say that the po
lice of the big cities may as well spare
their efforts in searching for her along
the brick or stone pavements, for they
believe that Lizzie McCarey has been
moved by a strong feeling of home
sickness to pick up her belongings and
on a trip back to the spot from
which sho was taken a little more than
a year ago by the Berkeley family in
whose home she recently lived.
"Lizzie McCarey," of course, is not
the Indian maiden's original name. She
was called "Artmah" when with her
people in Modoc County, and received
the name savoring of Hibernian origin
"hen she was brought to the university
town and domiciled at Dana and Derby
streets. Her home life there was happy
enough, apparently, until recently,
when she evinced a distaste for its
| confining character. This led to fric
tion in the family, resulting in her dis
appearance.
I^AWRENCE TO FINISH
SENTENCE IN JAIL
Capitalist Prefers to Complete His
Term of Three Days' Imprison
ment Pending Wife's Action.
OAKLAND, Feb. 16. â Though he
has thousands of dollars at his com
mand, George E. Lawrence, the Pied
mont capitalist, prefers to remain in
the City Prison for three days serv
ing a sentence imposed upon him for
drunkenness rather than to pay the
$6 that would give him his freedom.
The predicament in which Law
rence finds himself is due in large
measure to the declaration of Mrs.
Lawrence to the end that she pur
poses to prosecute her spouse on a
charge of attacking her with a carv
ing knife duringr a domestic mix-up
night before last. Mrs. Lawrence has
thus instructed her attorney, Thomas
Bradley.
On the other hand, Lawrence haz
ily nuggets that he was assaulted by
his wife in the melee that aroused the
neighborhood, sent Mrs. Lawrence to
the hospital and brought out the po
lice, headed by Chief Hodgkins in per
son. Lawrence, it is suggested by his
attorney, will remain in Jail the three
days that he may clear his beclouded
mind in readiness for the next step

The fate of senior singing was to
have been decided at a meeting on
North Hall steps this evening, but the
inclement weather made postponement
of the discussion necessary. Senior
singing is a tradition esteemed by some
seniors and ignored by others. Lately
there have been only a few in attend
ance at the singings on the steps, and
accordingly Nat Eddy, leader of the
singing, addressed the following letter
to the class to-day:
"Lest we forget, I wish to state that
senior singing will take place at 7:30
o'clock this evening. Many say they
forget to go, and the result of the last
two senior singings has been ruinous.
If the seniors wish to drop the best tra
dition they have, then why not come
out to-night and let all agree? This
I is no roast, but do wake up, seniors,
j and be present to-night. Bring the
college songbook and let's awake the
slumbering spirit. N. N. EDDY."

LAW TANGLES
AGED COUPLE
Though Beyond Three Score
and Ten They Eepent
Marriage Late, in Life
â â â  * . .
HE ASKS MAINTENANCE
She Answers With a Suit for
Divorce, Alleging That He
Has Been Cruel to Her
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 16.
In their declining years Mrs. Sarah
, Smith McMahon and Daniel McMahon,
both over 70 years of age, find them
selves tangled in the meshes of the
law through a late marriage contracted
on ChrlstmaÃ, 1897. Suit for mainten
ance was brought against her some
time ago, it being alleged she had
plenty of money, while he had none.
She answered his suit In kind and filed
one for divorce on her own account to
day, alleging cruelty; that the old man
had scolded her when she was ill and
struck her with hi* fist.
The facts alleged in the various
papers filed are that she left him and
went to New York to live, and that
shortly afterward he had a paralytic
stroke and was unable to take care of
himself and became dependent on
others, who brought a suit to make his
wife take care of him. They alleged
she was living In luxury, while he was
destitute. She says that he has prop
erty worth $10,000 in the name of his
nephew, Edward Dougery, and that it
brings him a monthly sum of $26. On
the other hand she says that she has
not the wealth credited to her, and that
her holdings do not exceed the total of
$15,000.
SCHOOL BOARD SUMMONED
BEFORE THE GRAND JURY
A. P. Schulze, Turned Down by the
Directors, by Chance Becomes
Chief Inquisitor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 16.
The Grand Jury met this afternoon
and had before it School Directors
John D. Isaacs and LÂ». J. Hardy and
Superintendent McClymonds. These
members were summoned to answer
certain questions in regard to their
proceedings in the building of the new
s( hoolhouses under the recent bond is
sue. They were asked why they did not
act more expeditiously and why the
bonds had all been sold at one time.
These questions were answered by the
statement that the board was acting
as fast as it could, but that owing to
people holding out for exorbitant
prices for their lands the progress was
slow In some directions. As to the
sale of the bonds the members de
clared that they had been instructed
by the District Attorney that under the
law they all had to be sold at one time.
The members thus questioned, how
ever, do not treat the matter seri
ously, but seem to see a certain
amount of humor in the fact that the
chief inquisitor of the Grand Jury is
A. P. Schulze, an architect, who was
turned down by the Board of Educa
tion in a plea made before that body
to have the competitive plans for the
school buildings submitted under the
rules and regulations governing such
tests laid down by the San Francisco
Chapter of Architects. In the turn af
fairs have taken he is now In a posi
tion to summon the members before
him and question them in regard to
their motives.

AGAIN CHARGES
EMBEZZLEMENT
Crane Company Files a Sec
ond Accusation Against
Former Oakland Manager
EXPEKT MAKES KEPORT
Discrepancies in Accounts
of George Jeft'ress Said
to Eeach a Large Amount
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 16.
George H. Jeffress, former manager
In Oakland of the Crane Company,
wholesale dealers In plumbers' supplies,
was arrested to-day on a second charge
of embezzlement, the complaint having
been sworn out by H. M. Haldeman.
Pacific Coast manager of the company.
Jeffress was arrested as he left Police
Judge Samuels' courtroom this morn
ing, where he had appeared to answer
a charge of embezzlement lodged
against him ten days ago by Haldeman.
The amount alleged in the second
complaint to have been embezzled is
$102 85. The first complaint recites that
$100 was taken.
Haldeman said an expert had been at
work on Jeffress' books for several
weeks, with the result that discrepan
cies In a large amount had been uncov
ered. Jeffress, who had been out on
bail in $2000 bonds, gave a second bond
for $2000, with H. O. Osgood and AL J.
Mitchell as sureties.
The first case was continued by Judge
Samuels to February 25. Justice of the
Peace J. O. Quinn, before whom the
second case will be heard, set the mat
ter for March 1.
FAVORITE NIECE MUST
DIVIDE UNCLE'S FORTUNE
Judge Hebbard Requires That Mrs.
Boggs' Agreement With Rela
tives Be Carried Out.
Aa was forecasted in his written opin
ion some weeks ago declining to throw
the case out of court on a pleading of
the "fraud act," Judge Hebbard yes
terday decided that Mac H. B. Boggs,
as sole heir and favorite niece of
W. L. Smith, the wealthy Redding
stage driver, must divide her inher
itance with at least three of her rela
tives.
When Smith died, leaving an es
tate valued at $130,000 to Mr 3. Boggs,
there were surviving him two sisters
In the East and five nephews and
nieces in California, to say nothing
of one Maggie McKlnney, who claimed
to be his widow. Mildred Wellen
dorff, since dead. A. J. Bacon and
lone B. Spencer, with two other
nephews of the deceased, found they
had good grounds for a contest of the
unequal will. An agreement was
drawn whereby the nephews and
nieces were to abandon their proposed
contest and receive each a one-tenth
interest In the estate. Three of the
contestants signed the agreement,
and the signatures of the others were
not procured by Mrs. Boggs, -who
held the paper. She proceeded to get
a distribution of the estate and then
repudiated the agreement. When the
three signers sued for their share she
pleaded that the agreement was made
by them with the intent to defraud
the sisters of Smith, then living. Judge
Hebbard ruled that they had per
formed their part of the contract by
not contesting the will, therefore the
agreement was valid.
Since losing the suit Mrs. Boggs has
set up that the estate is only worth
$16,000. but Judge Hebbard appointed
ex-Judge Sweeney of Redding as ref
eree to determine its real value.
HEYDENFELDT HEIRS SEEK
DAMAGES FROM SECRETARY
Allege That James B. Brooks Ob
tained by Fraud a Deed to Prop
erty on Howard Street.
The Heydenfeldt heirs, who, under
the name of the Peninsula Investment
Company, sued to quiet title to the
property at the corner of Howard and
Eighth streets, began a new action
yesterday for damages agrainst James
B. Brooks, secretary and agent of the
company, who Is charged with de
frauding his employers. The com
plaint Is directed against Brooks,
Nellie Clark and Frank McEwen. It
Is recited that Brooks, as secretary
and agent, was intrusted with the sale
of the property in question at a fixed
price of $55,000.
On November 24, it Is stated,
Brooks obtained a deed from the es
tate transferring the property to Nel
lie Clark. He gave no consideration,
and it is alleged that the transfer was
in his own interest. It is said that
Nellie Clark has since transferred the
property tq McEwen, also without
consideration, and that the property
Is held for Brooks, and the rents,
amounting to $300 a month, are being
collected for him.
For the fraud alleged to have been
practiced by Brooks the plaintiff
company demands $15,000 damages
and a decree of the court establishing
an equitable interest in the property.

Motion to Make Injunction
lVrmanent Continued for
Argument T ntil Tuesday
The argument on a motion for a
l-ermanent injunction to. restrain and
â¢ njoin the Pacific ving* Bo
from transacting further busi-
BB the ground that it is insolvent
MM to have been heard before Judge
Lawtor yesterday afternoon at 2
o". lot k. Attorneys representing vari
ous interests were present.
When the case was called the Judge
that another date for hear-
B agreed upon, as he could not
â ake tip the case.
Attorney O. I. Wise, representing
stockholders who had paid in more
than $100,000. said that the only ques
tion up was the appointment of re
ceivers, as all were agreed that the
society was insolvent. That should
not take much time and he pleaded
urgency.
Attorney Van Ness, representing the
Canadian and American Mortgage and
Trust Company, holders of the soci
ety's debenture bonds, who had filed
a complaint In Intervention, said that
the society's debts amounted to about
$72,500* He thought there was noth
ing to justify the appointment of re
ceivers and asked whether the parties
interested could not agree upon the
best method of liquidating the estate.
He suggested that a continuance of
four or five days he granted to see if
it were not possible to make some sat
isfactory arrangements in that direc
tion. The temporary restraining or
der was sufficient to prohibit the so
ciety from doing any further business.
Attorney Wise said that Van Ness'
fli^ntp â were nominally secured and so
'â nltll Meyers bank, but hi? cli
ents were unsecured. There was
nothing to prevent Meyer from fore
closing, thereby depriving others of
the benefit of any surplusage. He re
peated that the only question was the
naming of receivers. The rights of
Van Ness' clients could not be im
paired.
The arguments went over till Tues
â¢norning. and the attorneys were
I to come prepared with authori
n to whether the allegations in
the complaint were sufficient to auth
orize the court to appoint receivers.
Attorney Wise then filed a com
plaint in intervention on behalf of W.
H. Kent and -00 other stockholders.

The deed was performed by a lone

barroom and ordered beer. It is
thought they were accomplices, as

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THINK IT OVEK.
Something You Can See in Any Res-
taurant or Cafe.
A physician puts the query: Have
you never noticed In any large restau-
rant at lunch or dinner time the large
number of hearty, vigorous old men at
the tables: men whose ages run from 60
to 80 years; many of them bald and all
perhaps gray, but none of them feeble
or senile?
Perhaps the spectacle is so common :
as to have escaped your observation or
comment, but nevertheless It is an ob-
ject lesson which means something.
If you will notice what these hearty
old fellows are eating you will observe !
that they are not munching bran crack-
ers nor gingerly picking their way
through a menu card of new-fangled
health foods; on the contrary, they
seem to prefer a Juicy roast of beef, a
properly turned loin of mutton, and
even the deadly broiled lobster is not
altogether Ignored.
The point of all this is that a vigor-
ous old age depends upon good diges-
tion and plenty of wholesome food, and
not upon dieting and an endeavor to
live upon bran crackers.
There Is a certain class of food cranks
who seem to believe that meat, coffee
and many other good things are rank
poisons, but these 'cadaverous, sickly- ,
looking Individuals are a walking con-
demnation of their own theories.
The matter, in a nutshell, is that if
the stomach secretes the natural di-
gestive Juices in sufficient quantities
any wholesome food will be promptly
digested; if the stomach does not do so,
and certain foods cause distress, one or
1 wo of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after
each meal will remove all difficulty, be-
cause they supply Just what every!
weak stomach lacks â pepsin, hydro-
chloric acid, diastase and nux.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not
act upon the bowels, and, in fact, are
not strictly a medicine, as they act al-
most entirely upon the food eaten, di-
gesting It thoroughly, and thus give a
much needed rest and giving an appe-
tite for the next meal.
Of people who travel nine out of ten
use Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, know-
ing them to be perfectly safe to use at |
any time and also having found out by 1
experience that they are a safeguard j
against Indigestion in any form, and 1
eating, as they have to, at all hours 1
and all kinds of food, the traveling
public for years have pinned their faith
to Stuart's Tablets.
All druggists sell them at 50 cents for
full-sized packages, and any druggist
from Maine to California, if his opinion
were asked, will say that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets is the most popular and
iraccessful remedy for any â  stomach
trouble. -^_ _â

ARE REQUESTED
Board of Health Appeals to
Public to Give Better Diet
to City Hospital Employes
CHINATOWN SANITARY
Supervisors Are Asked to
Amend Existing Plumbing
Laws. Deemed Inadequate
The Board of Health met yesterday
and adopted a resolution appealing to
the public- for donations in the way of
better food for the patients, employes
and internes at the City and County
Hospital. The attaches of the institu
tion recently submitted an appeal for a
more wholesome diet than corned beef,
hamburger beans and other
dainties, which are being served daily.
An appeal for relief was made by Prcs-
Ident Ward to the Finance Committee
<if the H<>aid of Supervisors, but with
out avail. The resolution follows:
Whereas, The funds allowed by the Board
of Supervisors for the maintenance of the City
and <'"'.nty Hospital ai-p wholly inadequate to
thÂ» healthful maintenance of the patients, em
ployes and attaches of the institution; and.
WhereiiS: Our d<?eir<? for a betterment of the
food, especially lor the nurses, upon whose
sood health must depend to a large degree thÂ«
valuable assistance they render to the inmates
of the institution, has been shown by th*> FresH
dent's personal appeal to the Finance Commit
tee; and.
Whereu, A petition has just been received
from the internes asking for a better table
and announcing the fact that "5 per cent of
the nurses me rick because the food, while 'of
cood quality, is very limited in its variety;
therefore, â <:â  i:
Resolved, That the charitably inclined citi
zens of San Francisco be asked to contribute
directly to the hospital, or through the ladies'
committee of the California Club, vegetables,
fruits and milk, to allow a more' liberal dirt
and thereby maintain better health of the
nurses and medical staff.
N\ F. Titus and C. W. Beaver were
appointed assistant chemists in the
pure food department.
J. H. Smith was appointed watchman
at the new leper hospital, the salary of
|2S per month being too low for civil
service certification.
The board accepted the new portable
sterilizer and requested the Supervisors
to provide the necessary funds to meet
it? running expenses.
The Board of Supervisors was request
ed to abrogate the existing ordinances
governing plumbing because inade
quate. The ftoard asked that new or
dinances be passed in accordance with
suggestions submitted.
The board adopted a resolution urg
ing the Board of Supervisors to con
struct the new hospital buildings under
the bond issue upon the present site, at
Twenty-second street and Potrero ave
nue.
Miss Dykeman was appointed matron
at the County Hospital, at a salary of
$50 per month.
The board adopted a resolution recit
ing that it has been one year since any
contagious disease has existed in Chi
natown as to require quarantine meas
ures, and that the district has now
passed into a comparatively sanitary
state through the united efforts of the
Federal, State and municipal Boards of
Health. The marine hospital service
was ordered to be notified to that effect,
and a vote of thanks was extended to
Dr. Rupert Blue for his skillful co
operation in all that has pertained to
the welfare of this city.
The owners of premises at 2964 Twen
ty-second street, 799 Vallejo, 1424 Powell
and I^l7 Fillmore street were ordered
to show cause on February 27 why they
should not be vacated.

REORGANIZATION PLAN
Retrenchment Rumor Denied
WELL-KNOWN SHIPBUILDER WHO WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE
UNION IRON WORKS OF THIS CITY AT A MKKTING OF THE COMPANY'S
DIRECTORS HELD YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK.
Robert Forsyth was elected president
of the Union Iron Works yesterday at
a meeting of the board of directors
hold in New York. At the same time
E. L. Mcllwaine of the Bethlehem Steel
Company was made chairman of the
board.
Forsyth has been chief engineer of
the works. He succeeds Willis G.
Dodd, who has held the office for two
years, both under the Scott regime and
since the works became part of the
United States Shipbuilding Company
properties.
It is reported that this change is part
of a general retrenchment scheme and
that after old contracts are finished
little or no shipbuilding will be done
at the Union Iron Works. The work
will be done on the Atlantic Coast,
where material and labor are cheaper.
The working force of the plant has
been gradually cut since Schwab ob
tained control of the works and em

RECEIVER THOMPSON
VINDICATED IX COURT
United States Commissioner Finds
That the Official Was Guilt
less of Crime.
United States Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday dismissed the charges
against James F. Thompson, former
ly Receiver of the Land Office at Eu
reka, Humboldt County. Mr. Thomp
son was accused of having illegally
exacted and received fees of $10 each
from applicants making timber land
entries, the money to be applied to
"proving-up" expenses. It was shown
on the hearing before the Commis
sioner that Receiver Thompson had
followed a custom which prevailed in
every land office in the United States 1
and that when he w r as advised by a
land office agent that the collection of
this fee in advance was illegal he
ceased to exact it. It was also shown
that the Receiver had advertised in six
newspapers of Humboldt County re-r
questing applicants who had paid the
$10 fee to call at his office and re
ceive their money.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC HAS
BEST OP ARGUMENT
The Supreme Court yesterday grant
ed a new trial to the Southern Pacific
Company in a suit brought by that
corporation to condemn certain land
in Summerland, Santa Barbara Coun
ty, owned by the San Francisco Sav
ings Union and G. F. Becker. The
property Is rich In oil and on this fact
hinges the dispute.
The railroad wants to pay for a
right of way only, while the owners
of the land want to be reimbursed for
both the surface and mineral value of
the property. The lower court decided
In favor of the owners and excluded
the railroad people's evidence intend
ed to show that the easement for the
right of way was of less value than
title to the land throughout. The Su
preme Court thinks there is a differ
ence between the easement and the
fee and grants a new trial on that
ground.

scheme may extend to cutting down
the force still more.
These reports are scoffed at by
George Fredericks, one of the repre
sentatives of the works. "The story
that shipbuilding will be abandoned is
ridiculous. We have had to let some
men go because the work is slack. It
has been slack all over the country.
Mr. Forsyth's appointment is in line
with a general reorganization plan."
Robert Forsyth has been in the em
ploy of the Union Iron Works for
twenty years and has had charge of
all the shipbuilding work during that
time. The first work he did here was
on the Charleston. His reputation for
knowing marine mechanical construc
tion is high.
Willis G. Dodd, whose place Forsyth
takes, declined to discuss the matter
last night. He said that Henry T.
Scott might throw some light on the
intentions of the directors of the works.
Scott is due to arrive to-day from the
East.

SALiOOX PROPRIETOR'S WIFE
SAYS HUSBAND IS BAD MAN
She Is Twenty Years His Senior and
Believes Her Predecessor Was
"Kicked to Death."
"When Alex R. Anderson, proprietor
of the Three Crowns saloon on Jack
son street, sued his wife, Fanny An
derson, for divorce on the ground of
habitual intemperance, he probably
did not look for a cross-complaint so
strong as the one she filed yesterday
by her attorney, Warren Temple. Mrs.
Anderson says she is 70 years old, her
husband is 50 and they were mar
ried in December, 1901. At the time
of the union, she says, she had $3000
and she charges him with having
robbed her of it. Besides the saloon,
he owns property on Clement street,
in which she claims a share. She
avers upon oath that after she mar
ried him she found out that he
"kicked his first wife to death."
Denying the charge of intemperance,
she says he held her and poured liquor
down her throat and then threw her
out of the house.
Judge Graham yesterday granted a
divorce to Eva E. Auzerais from Raoul
Auzerais, one of the San Jose family
of that name. He deserted her two
years ago. Divorces were granted by
Judge Graham to Mary L. Bierbauer
from Max H. Bierbauer, for desertion:
by Judge Hunt to Eveline Bernard
from Samuel Bernard, a tailor, deser
tion; by Judge Kerrigan to Thomas
Garstang from Alice Garstang, deser
tion; by Judge Sloss to Jane Whit
taker from Ellsworth Whittaker,
neglect.
Suits for divorce were begun by Lil
lian G. Miller against Eugene G.
Miller, desertion; by Bertha Taylor
against Frank D. Taylor, desertion;
and by E. L. Hale against William F.
Hale, desertion.

FOUR KILLED
ON SUBMARINE
Explosion on British Vessel
at Queenstown Also Causes
Injuries to- Fourteen 3len
QUEENSTOWN* Feb. 16>â Four men
were killed and fourteen injured as the
result of two explosions on board the
British submarine boat "A-5" in this
harboj to-day. Those killed include
Lieutenant Skinner, Engineer Artificer
Chaffee and two stokers. Three of the
injured are in a critical condition.
Lieutenant H. G. Good, commander of
the vessel, was* blinded. His condi
tion is critical. Only one man of the
entire crew escaped uninjured.
The first explosion occurred while the
crew was engaged in filling the gaso
line tank preparatory to proceeding
outside the harbor, and as a result the
"A-5" caught fire. A number of the
crew of the torpedo gunboat Hazard
volunteered to go to the rescue of the
submarine boat's crew, but hardly had
they boarded the "A-5" when a second
explosion took place and all the res
cuers were more or less injured.
The submarine boat was afterward
docked and an official statement made
this evening saying the vessel had not
suffered much damage. An official In
quiry into the cause of the explosion
will be held to-morrow.

AFTER STANDARD OIL.
*^p*HE success of the administration in its pursuit of the beef
trust has incited the House to move on the Standard Oil Trust
* on the lines laid down by President Roosevcl:. The House has,
by resolution, unanimously adopted, ordered the Secretary of Com
merce and Labor to institute a drastic investigation of Standard
Oil covering its practical confiscation of competing plants, its meth
ods and its profits. It is fortunate that this quest will be made by
Secretary a trained and very able lawyer. When he is
through it will be found that a case is prepared, fully, and in shape
for an issue in the courts. What he does will not only make a case
for the courts but for Congress also.
The air for years has been full of rumors and of facts respecting
the methods of" Standard Oil. That trust has, through taking to
â  If all of the profits of the oil business, by combining production,
distillation and transportation, acquired a power that is regarded by
the people with apprehension. They will experience relief when
its ways are laid bare, and wherein they contravene the public in
terest are curbed and punished.
No sound thinker wishes to put a limit upon the legitimate ac
quisition of wealth by saying how much may be accumulated by in
dividual or corporate enterprise. Such a bar to energy is not con
sent with free government. Men must enjoy liberty for lawful
and legitimate acquisition. If a legal limit bl put upon wealth, that
which is first fixed and regarded as right will soon appear wrong and
unjust to those below it, and it -will be lowered again. This process
will go on until all property is abolished at the behest of those who
have none. When that time comes stagnation occurs, because the
spur of acquisition is taken away and men lose their motive for
thrift and industry.
But while this is true, it is also true that the law can impose
restrictions, and should impose them upon what all men recognize |
and the spirit of the common law condemns as illegitimate methods j
of getting wealth. Among these is the system of rebates, by which
the Standard Oil Company is believed to have destroyed competition
by gaining for itself a secret advantage in freights, and its other i
method of lowering prices at competing points until it practically ;
confiscated competition, and then raising them again. These are j
illegal or improper advantages, the enjoyment of which is mainly re
sponsible for the power of that company, exercised through its ac- j
cumulations of capital. Heretofore there has seemed to be no way J
of getting at it.
Its facilities for arresting legislative investigation have been
used effectively. But even if they had not been used at all, no State
Legislature and no Congress can make such an investigation, with
results of any force or benefit. An executive investigation is a dif
ferent matter. It is made by that branch of the Government which
can carry its conclusions immediately into the courts. This cannot
be done by Congress, except by resolutions instructing the executive,
In the transit of an affair through so many hands its force is dissi
vd. There are opportunities at every transfer to dilute the pro-!
-^es. and effective results are impossible. The legislative branch |
the Government, State and National, may better take its instruc- i
BS from judicial decisions procured by the executive energy. and
devote itself to the passage of such regulative and restraining laws
as are found to be necessary. '
It iÂ« seen at once that the President's war upon rebates strikes i
at one of the means used by the Standard Oil Company to monopo- j
lire the field. Its other method of killing competition by reducing j
prices for the purpose of confiscation, and raising them again when |
that is accomplished, must be dealt with by legislation. The Supreme I
:rt has affirmed the constitutional power of Congress to do this
by the use of its authority to regulate commerce between the States.
Let Congress enact that whenever prices are reduced to meet
competition at one point they shall be lowered to the same level *
rywhere. and not raised again anywhere until the Government I
nd at once competition with Standard Oil will appear all ;
over the country. Denied rebates on freight and compelled to give !
prices everywhere, its business will fall to the legiti
mate level of conjpetition. and the profits of the oil business, which
>\v takes entirely to itself, will be divided with a crowd of com- j
- and the day of its enormous accumulations will end.
Not only will it be curbed and its power broken by such legisla
(l all other monopolistic mists which imitate its methods will
he likewise curbed and their several monopolies destroyed by law
fully protected competition.
The most wholesome and far-reaching consequences may well
follow the work of our California member of President Roosevelt's
C aliinet.
TEACHING BELLIGERENCE.
PROFESSOR SPARKS of the University of Cnicago has said
a true word when he warns that "one year's teaching of American
history in the public schools will undo the work of a dozen peace
commissions or peace tribunals. If we want to have perma/ient
itration courts," he adds, "we will have to leave out our
The force of the Chicago professor's remarks will become mani
- who takes a glance at the average school history used
edncatMM of grammar grade pupils. The book is divided ac
wmn we have fought, and the periods thus marked out
ihoir turn subdivided under the various names given bloody
battle fields. The smart scholar can rattle off Washington's cam
paign in New Jersey or recite Grant's maneuvers about Donelson
with glib promptitude without a thought to the record of railroad
building in the West, the peaceful conquest of the Louisiana Pur
chase territory by the plow and the woodman's ax, or the revolution
wrought in manufacturing by the thousand and one inventions which
have made our nation the power that it is. The school history teaches
belligerence, not patriotism. We do not build our faith in our coun
try upon the conquest of Mexico, nor yet upon the destruction of
Cervera's fleet at Santiago. Upon the development of civil and re
ligious liberty, upon our industrial advancement, the increase in our
status as an enlightened commonwealth, not upon battles and sud
den alarms, rests patriotic pride.
THE POLICE SHAKEUP.
THE sudden diversion of the rod of correction from members of
the former Chinatown squad to the Chief of Police was not a
surprise to Those who have observed the war between the Police
Commissioners and the Grand Jury. Something ulterior has been
in the shadows of the controversy from the beginning. It may be a
desire to secure an administration chief of the force, or a set pur
pose to stop gambling in Chinatown for the sake of the morals of
the Chinese. So far it has not been shown that Chinese gambling
affects anybody but the Chinese themselves, except such members
of the police force as are willing to close an eye for a consideration.
Practically considered, Chinese gambling concerns the city less than
almost any other of the vices that nest in large cities, for it is con
fined principally to the Chinese.
The ordinances and laws which forbid percentage games apply
to whites and Chinese alike, and should be equally enforced. But
with all that is said against the police for their laxity, it is true that
San Francisco is as free of the gambling vice as any other large
American city, with the Chinese games thrown in. If it is a con
clusion of the administration that Chief Wittman must go, he will
go. But after that and all that follows it, there will be gambling in
Chinatown and outside of Chinatown, no matter who steps into his
shoes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 17, 1905
TO PUNISH HERRICK
EUGENE ORTON
LÂ£ â I â HEY tell me," said the girl
â¢ * I softly, "that Mr. Herrick has
[ offered you' the place of su
â  perintendent of his vine
yards."
"Yes," said Bob Corson shortly,
"he said something about It."
"I understand he urged you."
"Precisely," agreed Corson. "Urged
me to get out of the way."
"Of what?" she asked Innocently,
though her face glowed redly.
"If you don't know," said Corson
shortly, "it's too long â and dangerous
to tell."
"I should not be angry if some one
offered m e a place like that," she be
gan, taking another tack.
"It's quite likely Herrick will," cried
! Corson bitterly; "that and his other
goods and chattels, including himself,
the thing of least value, attached to
his estate."
She held up her hand. "It isn't fair
; to speak like that," she cried in a hurt
voice. "He Is a good sort at heart."
"This wasn't offered out of the
goodness of his heart," retorted Cor
son, "but out of the of his
intellect. He knew that after the
crash in G. and W. I was flat done for.
He was afraid that I would still have
the cheek to ask the sweetest girl in
j the world to be my wife, and he of
j fered me the place to get me out of
j the way because he wants the girl for
himself."
"We do not always get what we
want," she reminded him.
"We do â when we have money," he
said cynically.
"See here, Bob Corson." She spoke
sharply now. "I think you are going
[to be foolish. I think Mr. Herrick of
j fered you the place because he knew
it would be a good one for you. He has
none of the selfish motives you Imag
ined. You are merly Jealous. I have
always found him a most delightful
man. I don't think he ever thought
of sendfng you away because he Imag
ined that I'd marry him If you were
not here."
Corson was about to retort, but the
curtains were drawn aside and the
butler entered with a card. Helen
flushed slightly, but her voice was
even as she told the servant to show
the caller in. It was Herrick himself,
and as he entered the room and greet
ed them both Helen's quick eye
caught a glance of triumph in Her
rick's responding to Corson's look of
hate.
She had never supposed that his
offer to Corson was induced by any
thing other than a desire to be of
service to a friend whose fortune had
been wrecked by unstable securities.
Now she could see that Corson had
been quicker to grasp the motive.
"We wer# just talking 1 of your offer
to Mr. Corson," she said. "I think it
is a most excellent thing."
Herrick flashed a look of triumph
at his rival. "A most excellent thing
for us both," he agreed. .
"Mr. Corson does* not appear to
fancy the idea," she continued, "and
1 have been trying to induce him to
accept."
Herrick's eyes brightened. He had
been afraid that after all he could not
dispose of his rival so easily. He had
never supposed that Miss Brvlng
would help him.
You see." she said steadily, "Mr.
Corson does not like to leave all of
his friends behind."
"He can easily make others out I
there," sugegsted Herrick.
"Just what I think," ehe agreed. "It

is easy to make friends anywhere if
one is so inclined."
"I am delighted to find that you
agree with me," beamed Herrick. If
Helen Erving wanted him out of the
way there could be but one explana
tion, that she was willing to accept
himself and wanted to get Corson out
of town.
"The pay Is a little small," she went
on calmly, "but then I suppose that
could be accounted for on the ground
of lessened expense. "
"As for that," interposed Herrick.
"if $10,000 a year would prove more
of an inducement I would be willing
to raise it to that."
"I think that would be better,"
agreed Helen. "What do you think?"
Corson, to whom her last appeal
was made, evidently thought as did
Herrick, for his face was white and
drawn. "I think." he said slowly,
"that since you both are agreed, there
Is nothing to be done but to accept."
Herrick fairly beamed. "I have the
papers here," he cried gayly. "I ex
pected to see you at the club this
evening. Let's sign them now and
get it over with.
It was characteristic of the man
that he carried a fountain pen even In
his evening clothes, and five minutes
later the document was signed and
witnessed, whereby Charltop Corson
agreed, for the sum of $10,000 a year,
to serve for five years to the best of
his ability, the interests of Henry
Hamilton Herrick as superintendent
of the latter's vineyards on the other
side of the continent.
"There," said Herrick cheerfully,
"It's^ll done. Not a bad Income, Bob,
for a single man."
"He won't have that advantage,"
broke in Miss Erving sweetly; "you
see I was so' interested in the matter
because Mr. Carson is going to take
me out with him as his wife."
"Of course," explained Mrs. Cor
son in the overland Pullman a few
weeks later, "I should never have pro
posed to you. only I saw that he had

served to be punished." And they

THE LYNX-EYED
SPIES OF
RUSSIA.
Russia is pre-eminently the land of
spies. Democratic and socialistic
France has raised the spy-system to a
State function, but in Russia it is the
very soul of the state. In Moscow, in
the streets, agents of the police are
stationed every five hundred yards; in
addition, secret agents watch the
houses day and night â one being al
lotted to every four houses; and in
every house is another spy, the porter.
Go where you will, you are never out
at the watchful eye of the police. You
brush against spfes in your hotel, as in
the theaters; in a restaurant, as in the
drawing-room of a friend. It is ridicu
lously easy to recognize those you meet
In the fashionable resorts. They have
evidently been instructed to disguise
themselves as gentlemen, and for one
of them the livery of a gentleman is a
frock coat, a silk hat, and, always â by
rain or sunlight â an umbrella. The
famous third police! A stranger might
fancy that, in an open cab â talking
French or English to his friendâ he
would at least be safe rrom surveil
lance; but his friend will touch him
significantly and speak of the weather.
The fat cabby on the box, somnolent,
with white hair and good paternal eyes,
may be a spy, more skilled in the
languages than the traveling stranger;
and, if the cat/man has been found
loitering near the great clubs, the ho
tels, or the embassies, the chances are
strong that he is. A subtler police
than that of the third sectio-nâ the
akrana, which has its ramifications in
every capital in Europe and America
completes this great system of espion
nage. Its mesh is over every man in
Russia; no one goes un watched â save
only old Count Tolstoi.â Vance Thomp
son, in Success Magazine.
WHY WOMEN LIKE AUTOS
Just why woman likes an automobile
was expressed not long ago by a cyni
cal Newport bachelor â "because she
looks pretty In It, whether she sits on
the low steps and chats with a friend,
or goes flying along with veil and rib
bons rustling in the breeze. Then she
compels admiration for being able to
manage the beast, and, last but not
least, because she is enabled to so
gracefully defy the law by scorching
and getting a good run for her 'fine
money,' beside the excitement of being
pursued by a mounted cop with brass
buttons and on official star." There it
Is in a nutshell â one man's idea. He
may or may not be right; at any rate,
woman has taken to the automobile
with great enthusiasm, and she is not
only learning how to drive it, but is
also trying to gain a comprehensive
knowledge of the running gear of her
hobby. It is only natural that one
should find a fascination in driving this
new vehicle, which seems a thing life
less and inanimate, but which plunges
forward the moment you turn on the
power, and reverses and stops and
turns to right or left by the mere ap
plication of a lever. â Harriet Quimby,
in Leslie's Weekly.
NIGHTMARELESS RAREBIT
A bachelor whose skill at getting up
: dainty supper dishes assures him plenty
| of company in the evenings is respon-
I Bible for a substitute for the welsh rab
j bit that is free from nightmare. He
'â  covers lightly toasted bread with finely
i grated cheese, and instead of slipping it
i in the oven places it beneath the flame
: of the gas broiler until the cheese has
i been toasted to a light brown.
If a good cream cheese is used there
is not the slightest suggestion of soggi
ness or greasiness. and even those to
whom a rabbit means a night of trou
bled dreams may indulge in this with
no fear of evil consequences.
The trick lies in the grating of the
cheese. Broken into bits it would melt
into a pasty mass. Finely divided, each
particle should be individually toasted
before it has a chance to melt down,
and in that state it is readily assimi
lated.âNew York Press.
SENATOR AND THE LADY
Senator Pettus of Alabama is still
wonderfully : rugged and active. Some
time ago he was ambling along Penn
sylvania avenue. Washington, when he
saw an old lady ; trying to cross the
street 'in the , face of a gale of wind.
The Senator gallantly escorted her to
the sidewalk, whereupon 'she thanked
him and said: : "I hope, sir, that when
you are as old as â  I am you will find
those who are willing to : assist you
when â ;.'-. In trouble." â  "Thank you,
madams," Bald ? the , Senator. "I hope
so, too. : But how old are ; you, may I
ask?" : "Sixty-four, sir," was the trem
ulous reply. " "Ah! I am 83," said' the
Senator, as he lifted his hat and am
bled along. . .* *

MATRON VOCIFERATES
THROUGH KNOTHOLE
Her Language Is Abusive and Conveys
Fright to Next-Door Neighbor.
Tirade Results in Arrest
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
For a while little Mrs. Erskine was
frightened and puzzled as well as
angered by the vitriolic tirade ad
dressed to her as she bent over a
washtub in the kitchen of her humble
domicile, 305 Bryant street. She was
entirely alone at the time, yet the
language apparently emanated from
some Invisible scold within a few feet
of where she stood. "Spooks" was her
first terrified surmise, but a m6ment's
reflection assured her that no wraith
could maintain its self-respect and ut
ter the -words she heard. Besides, the
voice had a familiar tone. It was of
deep contralto quality that never
ascended above a mezzo In the upper
register. Mrs. Erskine's scare abrupt
ly vanished, but not her angrer and be
wilderment, when she identified the
voice as that of her next-door neigh
bor, Mrs. Mary Johnson, with whom
she had not been on speaking: terms
for some time. That discovery, how
ever, did not explain how Mrs. John
son's oral abuse was launched so close
to Mrs. Erskine while Mrs. Johnson
herself could not be seen. Was it pos
sible that Mrs. Johnson possessed ven
triloquial power to project her voice
through a thick wooden partition
without either impairing the Intelligi
bility of her words or fracturing the
timber? Ha! Might not a defect in
the timber afford means of vocal com
munication between the kitchens?
Mrs. Erskine would examine the par
tition. She did â and found a knot
hole. The mystery was solved.
With a great sigh of relief Mrs.
Erskine wiped the suds from her
hands, donned her hat and went and
filed formal complaint against Mrs.
Johnson for disturbing the peace. Po
lice Judge Fritz was assigned to hear
the case.
Mrs. Erskine repeated the words
that wafted to her from the knot
hole, but they would not bear tran
scription. She was sure they were
uttered by Mrs. Johnson, for who else
could have uttered them? No, she
did not see Mrs. Johnson, but un
doubtedly would have done so if she
had peeped through the knothole,
which she might have done if she had
not feared the poking of something
into her eye. Nor had !t occurred to
her to retaliate by sloshing soapy wa
ter or anything else through the knot
hole and Into the mouth that was be
rating her. She was a lady and re
ppected the law.
Mrs. Johnson, a large and corpulent
matron, told the Judge she was
mother of five and wife of a Scan
dinavian Invalid. She would not deny
that she used the knothole as a means
of speaking to Mrs. Erskine, but* she
did most positively deny that her
language was unfit for publication.
Bhe had simply requested Mrs. Erskine
to make less noise in her laundering
operation*, as Mr. Johnson and the
five were much annoyed by the loud
splashing and rinsing, to say nothing
of the fact that Un. Ersklne tried
to sing.
When the prosecuting attorney
asked for a continuance of the hear
ing until to-morrow, when the knot
hole will probably be produced as ma
terial evidence, and his request was
cheerfully granted by the bench.
Lhi Tick, whose barber shop Is at
Clay and Waverly streets, was so
chagrined by seeing his lifetime
enemy, Wong Duck, strut past the ton
sorial establishment In flowing silken
skirt and blouse that he rushed to the
door and cast a bucketful of lather
upon the gala attire, thereby shaming
the face of Wong Duck and provoking
his own arrest. He smilingly paid a
$5 fine and assured Judge Mogan that
the "accident" to Wong Duck would
not -recur.
Patrolman A. O. Skelly told Judge
Cabanlss that Miss Clara Jarman, a
statuesque negress attired In a long
brown velvet coat with lace cuffs con
cealing her hands, was arrested on
Stockton street, near Broadway, for
"roaming late."
"Be mighty keerful, man," said Miss
Jarman to the officer. M Ah nebbah

started to enter the street door of the
designated house Mr. and Mrs. Skidgel,
locked In embrace, rolled down stairs
and to his feet, thus obviating neces
sity of his ascending to their home.
The lady was coatless and hatless, and
thus she appeared before Judge Fritz
and tearfully pleaded for dismissal of
herself and spouse.
"Al was drinking," she said, "and
when he wanted to go out I tried to
prevent him. My arms were around
his neck and I was Uegging him to stay
at home when his foot slipped and he
tumbled down stairs, pulling me with
him. That's all there's to it, and the

When the mall conveyed a libelous

colate-skinned and willowy of form,
she armed herself and went forth to
find and punish Miss Juanlta Green,
ebon-complexloned and petite, whom
she cuspected of having sent the of
fensive thing. This suspicion was not
weakened by the alacrity with which
Miss Green fled when she saw Miss
Kennedy approach her with knife and
pistol and apparent murderous intent.
Miss Kennedy pursued, and the chaae
led through Pinckney alley, causing
great excitement among the residents
of that Afro-American pleasure resort.
Miss Green's comparative shortness of
nether limbs was offset by the cling
ing skirt which handicapped Miss Ken
nedy, and the race was not a cinch for
either of the ladies when a policeman
stopped it by arresting Miss Kennedy.
She was booked for carrying deadly
weapons and disturbing the peace.
Miss Kennedy averred that it was
not so much the pictorial phase of the
valentine as the written sentiment ac
companying It that exasperated her.

of herself shedding tears were scrawled

TRADES COUNCIL
AHEAD OF ORDER
Shows That Mantel-Maker
Was Declared Unfair Be
fore Injunction Was Served
AFFIDAVITS INTEREST
Secretary Explains Trouble
and Assistant Takes Up
the Burden of the Blame
Yesterday Judge Seawell discharged
the order to show cause why the
Building Trades Council should not be
enjoined from declaring the business
of T. F. Rigney unfair, the complaint
of Rigney and the court's temporary
restraining order not having been
served upon the council before the
aot complained of was committed.
Rigney is engaged in the business of
installing mantels and tiling. In his
complaint for an injunction he alleged
that the Building Trades Council had,
by its executive committee, cited him
to appear on January 81 to show
cause why he should not be declared
unfair. He did not appear before the
committee on the date named and by
his suit sought to prevent action by
the council at its meeting on February
2 approving the committee's dictation.
Bush Finnell of the law department
of the Citizens' Alliance represented
the plaintiff and Cleve L. Dam ap
peared for the Trades Council. After
Finnell had read the complaint Dam
offered an objection to further pro
ceedings on the contention that an in
junction could not operate against the
effects of an act already committed.
This contention, which was held to be
good by the court, was supported by
the affidavits of three members of the
/Building Trades Council.
O. A. Tveltmoe, secretary of the
council, told most of the story. He
denies Rigney's pleading of the ne
cessity to Import Eastern made man
tels, but says that the Trades Coun
cil has never objected to such im
portation if the goods were made un
der the trade conditions existing here
as to wages and hours of work. It is
further recited that prior to January
of last year Rigney conducted his
business contrary to the existing reg
ulations of the "affiliated unions" and
that the members of those unions re
fused to work f<*r him. In the mat
ter of his contract to install thirty-five
mantels for one Meyers, on Mission
street, the affiant says that Rigney
voluntarily appeared before the
Building Trades Council and agreed
to hire union men, pay union wages
for union hours of labor, and that he
agreed, if the conditions imposed re
garding the Eastern, made mantels
were violated, to pay 5250 into the
Little Jim fund of the Children's Hos
pital or any other charity the council
should select. The affiant says he
does not knew whether this payment
has been made or not.
The secretary continues that the ex
ecutive board of the council transacts
business in the interim of meetings
and such business is considered final
until reversed by the council. Rig
ney, not appearing on January 31,
was declared unfair by the executive
committee. Tveitmoe was absent
when the council met on February 2
and his place was filled by A. E.
Smith, assistant secretary. Smith in
his affidavit says that the action of
the executive committee in declaring
Rigney unfair was concurred in by
the council. After this action affiant
was called to the door of the council's
meeting place and served with a copy
of the plaintiff's complaint and the
court's temporary restraining; order,
which came too late.
Smith's affidavit was corroborated
by that of John J. Swanson, business
agent for the Carpenter's Council,
who was present at the meeting on
February 2.
Judge Murasky yesterday heard the
preliminaries on the motions of the
bakery unions to dissolve the tempo
rary restraining orders in the cases of
Swain & Co. and J. \V. Thorp & Co.,
wherein the plaintiffs seek a perpetual
injunction to prevent the labor organ
izations from picketing and boycot
ting their places of business. Bush
Finnell appeared for the plaintiffs and
R. P. Troy for the unions. The mat
ters were ordered submitted on briefs.

James Hlckox Carey, attorney at law

Coast In the opinion of the United
States secret service operatives, was
saved from the penitentiary yesterday
by the leniency of United States Dis
trict Judffe de Haven.
Instead of being committed to the
State prison he was sentenced to two
years' Imprisonment In the Alameda
County Jail â the longest Imprisonment
allowed by the statute. United States
Secret Service Agents George W. Hazen,
Thomas B. Foster and Harry Moffltt
had presented evidence against the
prisoner so strong: that Carey pleaded
guilty.
When the prisoner appeared for sen
tence yesterday morning Franklin K.
Lane, Henry Munroe, Seth Mann and
B. J. Prlngle appeared in court and
made a strong plea for mercy, not on
the ground that there was room for the
slightest doubt as to the prisoner's
guilt or that there were any extenuat
ing circumstances, but for the reason
that he had been a classmate of theirs
in the University of California and that
they believed he would reform.

THE ARENA
/ ...FOR...
FEBRUARY
It contains an important paper by W. G. Joans, a well-known
lawyer and journalist of Duluth, Minn,, entitled
The Armour Refrigerator-Car Conspiracy; or, A Crisis
in Interstate Commerce Regulation
It is a startling expose of the relations existing between the
refrigerator-car trust and the railways, which virtually throttle all
free competition and have enabled the trust to extort vast sums
from the producers and consumers in a manner probably only pos-
sible in the United States, where lawlessness of rich corporations
has reached its apogee. Many of the facts cited by Mr. Joerns
were adduced at the recent investigation of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. It is also fortified by the testimony of other prom-
inent citizens and by the citation of special cases, making the whole
exposure one of the most appalling disclosures of oppression and
moral turpitude that has yet bean brought to the attention of the
American people.

MARCH FIGHT PERMIT SUDDENLY BECOMES A CHOICE PLUM
FIGHT PERMIT
EAGERLY SOUGHT
i he Promoting Clubs Want
the March Date, but Su
pervisors Defer Action
SURPRISE AT NUMBER
Yosemite flub Is Ajrain ia
the Field. Contrary to the
Expectations of Managers
For some weeks past the boxing pro
moters have with one exception shown
no Interest in the March permit, and it \
was accepted as a foregone conclusion '
that if any fight was promoted it would
be under the auspices of the San Fran- i
Cisco Athletic Club.
The promoters awakened with a start
from their lethargy yesterday, when a
total of five applications were made to
the Supervisors for the permit. The
Yosemite Club, which some people had
pronounced out of existence, was repre- t
rented by a petition bearing "the sig- Â«
rature of Harry Monahan, its secre- 'â 
tary- *
Ed Harrington, who was associated
with Alex Greggains for a time, made
an application in the name of the
Brooklyn Club. Judd Glbbs wanted the
permit for the National Club. The Bay {
City Club, which has confined its ac
tivities In the past to the amateur;
frame, also sought the coveted permit-
The array of applicants proved too
much for the' Supervisors' Police Com
mittee and action was deferred for one
week. '*
The concerted action of the promoters
would indicate that they have an ink
ling as to the fate of the Ralston bill,
the adoption of which would put an end
to boxing in this State.
I.TTEIiY BOUTS EXPECTED.
Berger, Casey and Ah Win* the
Stars of To-Xicht's Boxing.
Seldom has such a double attraction
been put forward by a boxing club in
â¦he four-round game as the Berger-
Casey and Ah Wing-Billy Bannon
bouts, to be waged to-night before the
San Francisco Athletic Club in Wood
ward's Pavilion. Ah "Wing is a show
in himself from the novelty of seeing
a full-blooded Chinese adopting: the
â¢ v.hite man's game of fisticuffs. Those
who saw him last month, when he
knocked out Manuel Torres with the
famous pivot blow, will bear witness
that he can and does fight in an up
to-date manner. In Bannon the match
maker has plucked a tough customer
for the Celestial. Bannon is an Italian
of forbidding aspect, and is no stranger
to the role.
Of course the real interest centers
in Sam Berger and Jim Casey, the rival
heavy-weights who fought four rounds
to a draw a short time ago. Every
body who likes boxiifg knows' BeYger
and his capabilities. Casey was almost
a stranger before he sprung into prom
inence by giving Sam a great battle.
Many thought Casey should have had
the verdict. These men have trained
hard enough to go twenty rounds, in
stead of four, so bent Is each on win
ning. Burger will be attended by
Jimmy Brltt and "Spider" Kelly, while
Casey has engaged the offices of Jack
Sullivan, Billy Snallham and George |
Connolley. ' *l'_v
Casey is a whirlwind boxer, who
throws precaution to the winds and
hales away, in clinches and out of
them. Berger is the finished boxer,
and has won most of his bouts by
clean-cut decisions. So clever has Sam
appeared that many saw In him the
logical successor of Jeffries, although
he would be more of the Corbett style
of champion. It was Casey who upset
Berger's calculations before, and it
may be the same Casey who will do It
again.
In providing two feature events
Manager Alex Greggalns has not over
looked his preliminaries. He Is a be
liever In making an entertainment of
uniform quality, and it is becoming an
adage that "if it's Greggains' show,
It's good." Leo Marsh and" Fred "Lang,
heavies, will meet in the special. Clever
Harry Riley has a newcomer named
Gus Salide to cope with at 145 pounds.
Charlie Dunn and George Ellis mix at
135 pounds, Harry McCloud and Joe
Neil at 115 pounds, and Denny O'Con
nell and Jack McDowell at 128 pounds.
Greggains will be the third man in the
rln*.
GATES AT MORRIS PARK

Coarse.
NEW YORK. Feb. 16.â After sev
eral months of wrangling- over the
Question of racing dates for this sea
son, the stewards of the Jockey Club
met to-day and finally decided upon
days. The claims of seven tracks were
recognized â Jamaica, Bel
mont Park, Gravesenl, Sheepshead
Bay, Brighton Beach and Saratoga
The claims of Morris Park and" Em
pire City were rejected. The dates
allotted are practically the same as
In former years â all the old tracks,
with the exception of Morris Park'
â¢w ill be in the circuit. West Chester
course will be closed and the new and
magnificent track, known as Belmont
Park, will take its place.
This satisfactory arrangement of
dates for all but the Empire City
Club was arranged by the lease of
Morris Park by the "West Chester
Racing Association, the turf organi
zation which controls Belmont Park.
To avoid legal trouble with Messrs.
A. H. and D. H. Morris, the million
aire owners of Morris Park track, the
stewards decided the best course to
pursue was to take a lease of Morris
Park. They broached the subject to
the New York Jockey Club, and as a
result a transfer of the lease held by
the tenants of the ground was turned
over to the West Chester Racing As
sociation, which had held meetings
at that place for ten years.
Morris Park track will be closed,
but for how long could not be learned, j

OSHKOSH, Wis.. Feb. 16.â Governor
Lafollette ordered Sheriff Simpson to
stop the fifcht to-nlgrht between Thomas
Mowatt and Edward Hanlon. and the
contest was prevented. A large attend
ance had gathered to see the fight, many
spectators coming: from a distance.
The action of the executive spoiled
what was expected to prove a gTeat
'â onteet. Hanlon hae always been a con
piptent performer, vhile Mowatt has at
times made a sensational fight, and
then has put up some poor ones. Both
boxers had spent a lot of time prepar
ing for the affair.
LOOKING OVER
GOULD ROUTE
Agents of BiÂ£ Contracting
Firms Here Inspecting
Foal her Kiver Territory
Registered as "A. Frederick and par
ty, Chicago," four representatives of
two of the biggest railroad contracting
i firms in this country have been quietly
living at the St. Francis Hotel for a
number of days. They have positively
denied their identity and have refused
to make any statement as to the cause
of their presence in this city. It became
j known, yesterday, however, that they
j came West at the solicitation of Chief
I Engineer Bogue of the Western Pacific
| Railroad, and have been making trips
over the proposed route of the new
overland road with a view of bidding
later on its construction work.
Heading the party is Arthur F. Mac-
Arthur, vice president of the firm of
Mar Arthur & Brothers of Chicago, and
with him is his brother and two mem
bers of the firm of Kilpatrick Brothers.
Mac Arthur & Brothers have construct
ed many of the larger buildings In Chi
cago and the Middle West, including
the big railroad depots, and up te the
present time they have confined their
business operations mainly to that class
of work. It is, however, generally un
derstood that they have been secretly
interested in several big pieces of rail
road construction work with Kilpatrick
Brothers, who have been prominently
identified with contracting jobs along
the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific
road? for many years. Several months
ago Chief Engineer Bogue of the West
ern Pacific road invited a number of
big contracting firms to come West and
look over the territory through which
the new Gould line is projected. Mac-
Arthur & Brothers and Kilpatrick
Brothers, it is reported, decided to bid
for the big contract together, and un
a>r this arrangement representatives of
both firms came to California together.
The work of grading up through the
Feather River Canyon, which has been
carefully inspected by them, as well as
by representatives of the Utah Contract
ing Company and Lantry Brothers, is
said to be one of the most stupendous
undertakings in the history' of Western
railroad building, and will involve an
expenditure for grading alone of more
than $15,000,000. According to Engineer
Bogue, who is also staying at the St.
Francis, it Is proposed to start con
struction work in the Feather River
Canyon at least two years in advance
of work along the rest of the overland
route, which is not filled with obstacles
of the same magnitude as in the can
yon.

President McCarthy Wires Secretary
Treitmoe of Adjustment of New
York Difficulties. v
Information has been received by
Secretary O. A. Tveitmoe of the Build-
Ing Trades Council from President P.
H. McCarthy, who is now in New
York, that the building trades lockout
and strike which have been maintained
there for some time have' been settled.
A revision of the constitution and by
laws of the council was committed to
the following committee: O. A. Tveit
moe. E. A. Smith, W. W. Freeland. E.
A. Clancy and E. Barker, with instruc
tions to prepare the necessary amend
ments.
Much satisfaction was afforded by
the news received last night of the
failure of Thomas Rlgney to obtain an
injunction against the Building Trades
Council, which body has declared him
unfair.
Increased membership of the Labor
ers' Protective Union keeps the officers
and Investigating committees busy
every week passing on and initiating
the new candidates. At the last meet
ing of the union there were twelve
j members added to the roll, with an
equal number of applications on the
secretary's desk.
To fill vacancies John McManus was
appointed on the executive board of
the Building Trades Council, and M.
Mulvihill a delegate.

MAZAPAN REVELS IN THE MUD,
BEATING A SMART FIELD.
"810 BILL" KNAPP AND JONES
Mordente at 15
to 1 Is a Big
Surprise.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Probably the sharpest betting on
the card at Oakland yesterday was
the two-year-old scramble at half
a mile, for which nine trim young
sters went to the post. The winner
turned up in Mazapan, a finely chis
eled daughter of Solitaire and Sweet
Cakes, ridden by "Big Bill" Knapp
and sporting the colors of Napa Stock
Farm.
So stanchly supported were Busy
Bee, Eauorum, Rex and I'm Joe that
! the price about Mazapan receded
' from threes to 18 to 5. Away sixth,
the latter Miss quickly outfooted her
company, with the exception of Bel
lona, which acted as her traveling
companion. The latter found the
pace set too speedy, and; drawing
away the final sixteenth. Mazapan
won by two and a half lengths in
:4sy' 2 , a clever performance. Busy
Bee closed strongly, only losing the
place to Bellona by a neck.
HONORS FOR RNAPP AND JONES
Aside from this the chief feature of
the sport was the saddle work of
"Big Bill" Knapp and Jakle Jones,
each piloting three winners, com
pletely cutting out all of the other
riders. Four favorites annexed
purses.
Looking at the dope book upside
down and reading from right to left
Edrodun looked all wool and a yard
wide to win the Futurity course
sprint. On February Bâor,8 â or, to be
more precise, six days previous to St.
Valentine's day â the Morello three
year-old started in a five-and-a-half
furlong scramble with 108 pounds up.
He was a 9 to 10 favorite and fin
ished behind My Order and Alone. In
yesterday's race he picked up 115
pounds and closing favorite over My
Order beat Dr. Rowell's gelding half
a length. Grenore ran third.
Going back to_ the Seattle summer
meeting of 1904, it was difficult to fig
ure Mordente a chance in the mile and
three-sixteenths selling run. The mare
closed at 15 to 1, and, "leading from
start to finish, beat Mr. Dingle, the
favorite, over the line four lengths.
Cinnabar ran a fair third.
SOL LJCHTENSTEIN A WINNER.
Bell Reed found seven furlongs a
trifle too far. He ran a fair race in the
fourth, eventually finishing third. Sol
Lichtenstein, the favorite, with Knapp
on his back, gradually forged his way
to the front, disposing of Haven Run
without effort.
Rain caused the debut of Double Six
to be postponed. Jack Follansbee's
mare has no use for a wet track, so
Trainer Bob Smith succeeded in get
ting her excused from the six furlong
selling fixture. This left Sad Sam an
odds-on choice, and the Texas half
breed won ridden out from Romaine.
Sacredus got away poorly, and Capt.
Forsee, the only other starter, of
course was third.
Walter Jennings' Rockaway was
quite as warm a favorite for the clos
ing mile purse number. Closing a 9 to
20 chance, the chestnut horse, with
Knapp up, merely galloped out in
front from the time the barrier was re
leased. In a drive Foncasta succeeded
in downing Flaunt for the place.
TRACK NOTES.
Alarie's luck on short-priced ones still
holds out.
The mystery deepens. The rider of
Edrodun had orders yesterday to go
out in front if he could.
Clausus received considerable back
ing, but Barrett could not handle him
to advantage.
The official form chart says: "Alone
broke first, but was knocked out of it
at once and never recovered after
ward." The agony of all those who
grabbed that 6 to 6 to show about the
Summers entry was not prolonged,
either, and they were still out at last
accounts.
W. Davis was seated on a cracker
box turning the. crank of the peanut
roaster the other morning at the track.
The press handed the kid a few, so he
probably concluded one good turn de
served another.
Stake events of the Washlngtoa
Jockey Club close Wednesday, Febru
ary 22.
Jimmy Coffey is back from Ascot
Park with his stable, or the remnants
of it, at least. Laocoon died, Galanthus
met his death in a steeplechase and
Anirad Jimmy lost in a selling race.
Johnny Mellin sent up two of his string
with the Coffey horses.
McCarthy Defeats Jack Rellly.
SPOKANE. Wash., Feb. 16. â At the
Spokane Amateur Athletic Club to
night the largest crowd that ever wit
nessed a prize flght in Spokane saw
Jerry McCarthy of Spokane knock
out Jack Reilly of California in the
seventh round. Reilly went down
three times in the sixth, twice taking
the count of nine. The knockout blow
was a right swing to the Jaw. The
fighters are welter-weights and the
contest was to have been for twenty
rounds.
American Skater Victorious.

ford, and the results of his work here
prove he Is one of the best. It Is
ton who has made the observance of
training rules at Stanford a success.
"Dad" Moulton came to 3tn
from Notre Dame five years ago. Dur
ing his younger days he was a cele
brated professional sprinter, running
over three hundred races, of which he
lost only four. Forsaking the cinder
path Moulton became a trainer, turn
ing his attention at first to the develop
ment of professional sprinters. Lat^r
he trained several well-known pugilists
and bicycle riders. During the decada
whicta preceded his first engagement
by Stanford he had had charge of the
football and track teams of the univer
sities of Michigan. Minnesota. Wiscon
sin. lowa, Vanderbilt and the College
of Notre Dame. Among the many
noted amateurs developed under I
ton's tutelage have been J. V. I
the famous lowa sprinter; Kranzlein,
the University of Pennsylvania hur
dler and broad jumper, and John Me-
Pherson, once world's champion shot
putter. During his stay at Stanford
Moulton ha 9 developed a world v
champion pole vaulter in N. E. Dole
and an American intercollegiate cham
pion shot putter in < >. E. Hyde.
To-day Trainer Moulton received a
contract from the Pacific University of
Forest Grove. Ore., offering him a place
as coach of the track team of that col
lege from April 2C to June 12. He will
accept the offer if a leave of absence
can be procured from Stanford. Late
last spring Moulton coached Willamette
University.
According to an order issued by
Trainer Moulton and Coach Cowden
this morning the baseball men are to
undergo toe same strict training rules
as football and track athletes. Hereto
fore strict training has not been re
quired in baseball, but this year the
men will be asked to refrain from the
use of tobacco, alcoholic liquors and
keeping late hours. No baseball player
will be allowed to make an extended
trip off the campus without permission
of the coach and trainer.
LAUXDRT WAGOX DRIVER
ASSAULTED OX A CAR
Fred R. Gibbs Rouses Ire of Con-
ductor and Four Youths by Ten
dering Five Pennies.
Fred R. Gibbs, driver of a laundry
wagon, had an unpleasant experience
on a San Mateo car late Wednesday
night. He had been visiting a friend
on Capp street, between Eighteenth
and Nineteenth, and shortly after 11
o'clock he boarded a San Mateo car
at Nineteenth street to go home.
Gibbs handed the conductor flvo
pennies. The conductor threw them
on the street and demanded a nickel.
Gibbs refused, and the conductor
stopped the car at Twenty-fourth
street and threw Gibbs off. Four
young men who were under the in
fluence of liquor, helped the con
ductor to throw Gibbs off, and two of
them struck him several times on the
face and body. During the fight
Gibbs 1 hat and coat were pulled off
and he could not find them again. In
the coat were two laundry books and
slips.
Gibbs reported the affair to th* po
lice and was advised to swear out
warrants for the arrest of the con
ductor and the four young men, but
he failed to make his appearance at
the bond and warrant clerk's office
yesterday.

-A.PÂ«*HA>CE CO.. Â« Q-FarrtU â treatIS NOW LOADING CARGO FOR VLADIVOSTOK
British Tramp Steamer Glenturret Will
Attempt to Enter Russian Port.
Steam Schooners
Run Into Each
Other,
Whaler Califor
nia Starts on
Cruise,
The British steamship Glenturret,
which arrived recently from Singra^
ore. has been loading contraband for
Vladivostok at Oakland long wharf.
She goes to-day to Port Costa to com
plete her cargo. In view of the fine
meshes in the Japanese blockade act
the Glenturret's prospects of reaching
Vladivostok are thought to be slight.
and particularly so if the Japanese,
as reported, are now turning their
attention to the capture of the Rus
sian stronghold.
The Glenturret is going to make
the attempt, anyhow. In these days
of close competition and of charters
few nd low the temptation is great
to leave the safe but unremunerative
paths of legitimate commerce and
share in the high profits of blockade
running. As most of the vessels leav
ing here are playing the game, only
ltussia stands to lose anything.
Before the vessels leaves â¢ port the
representatives of the Czar have hand
ed to the owners of the blockade
runner'the freight money, a sum to
cover expenses and a paid-up insur
ance policy. If the steamer reaches
Vladivostok an additional bonus is
paid to the owner?, who share some
of this extra profit with captain and
crew.
If the Japanese seize and condemn |
the vessel the officers and crew are
brought home on a liner, and when
the amount of the insurance policy
has been collected the owner's books
show the vessel sold at a generous fig
ure.
As in the case of the Brlnkburn,
now on the way from here to Vladi
vostok, most of the Glenturret's of
ficers declined to serve on a block
ade running expedition. They fear, it
is said, that the British Board of
Trade might take cognizance of their
engagement in unlawful enterprise
and punish by taking away licenses.
The Glenturret's officers, including
The* chief engineer, resigned* and their
positions will be taken by men of
more adventurous spirit or greater j
necessity.
ioÂ«Â«ers in Collision.
The eteam schooners Point Arena and
Brooklyn were in collision yesterday off Meiggs
v hart. They were both coming in from Men
uocino. They passed passed through the
'ioiden â ; â < together and found the harbor
broad enough for them both until off Meifrgrs
wharf, where the channel is not more than
three miles wide. Another foot of room and
there would have b**n no collision. As It was
they crashed together, side to side, but with
no gr*>at force and neither vessel was seriously
njured. ' &!&**Â£&&&*&&
A Grand Army Souvenir.

wharfingpr's staff was presented yesterday

Remarkable Experience of Uittle Leon-

Some good angel was looking after

fell from the second-story window of
his mother's kitchen at 109% Perry
street. Dr. George Purlenky was sum

and found the child only slightly
bruised. "It was a marvel that he was
not killed," said the physician.
Leonard Gray, son of Mr. and Mrs.
Gtorge Gray, while playing in the
kitchen, climbed to the window, lost
his balance and down he went. Father
and mother thought he was killed, but
the little fellow only said: "Ooh! ooh!"
and felt his side. Mr. and Mrs. Gray
have much to be thankful for, they
say. Dr. Purlenky agreed.

GOEWEY ESTATE
IS IN TROUBLE
Charges of Fraud and "Fren
zied Finance" Are Lodged
by Husband of Heiress
SALAKY AND DIVIDEND
Four Sons of Deceased Are
Said to Have Conspired
to Defraud Only Sister
Allegations that compose a story
of progressive freeze-out, unfraternal
disregard of the memory of a dead
sister and complex financial manipu
lation of the sort described by Tom
Lawson are contained in a complaint
filed yesterday by John W. Havens,
executor of the will of Gertrude Goe
vey Havens, his wife, who died in
June, 1903. The defendants in the
sensational suit are well known here
and across the bay â Charles H., Her
bert S., James M. and Frank B. Goe
wey, A. Loessel and Frank- V. Wright,
officers and directors of the Goewey
Estate Company, as well as the com
pany itself and the Guaranty Loan
Company, a corporation alleged to
have been organized for the purpose
of assisting the Goeweys in their con
spiracy to defraud the estate of their
sister out of its interest in the com
pany, which holds the $200,000 es
tate of their father, James Goewey,
deceased. *
The Goewey Estate Company was
organized in April, 1903, by the chil
dren of James Goewey, and the prop
erty was then appraised at $178,000.
Mrs. Havens died three months later,
and on account of her illness had
never attended the meetings of the
directors, her brothers. She was suc
ceeded on the lpoard by Wright, to
whom her brothers each gave one
shure of stock. Each of the children
then held 200 shares of the company's
stock, but Frank's holdings have
since been transferred to Herbert,
though Havens questions the good
faith of the transfer.
In the complaint, after the various
interests arc- explained, it is alleged
that the brothers confederated to de
fraud Gertrude out of her rights and
divert the income of the estate to
themselves. In May, 1903, it is
charged, in pursuance of this con
spiracy, they voted a salary of $150
a month to Charles Goewey as presi
dent of the company, and $150 a
month to James as secretary, but the
duties of their respective offices, it
is sa.idÂ» were no| worth $15 a month.
On June 19, 1903, a few days after
the sister's death, they resolved to
suspend the payment of dividends,
and Havens expresses the belief that
since then the large earnings of the
estate have been misappropriated.
PAYS ASSKSSMEN'T.
On March 4, 1904, an assessment of
$10 a share was levied on the com
pany's stock, and it is declared that
this act was in further pursuance of
the conspiracy, the brothers believing
that their sister's estate was without
funds, and. a general administrator
not having been appointed, it would
be impossible for money to be raised
with which to protect her stock. Flow
ever, the husband. Havens, paid the
assessment of $2000 out of his owh
pocket. At this time, it is alleged,
the company was in receipt of $10.
000 a year, in rents and profits, over
and above all expenses, and the debts
amounted to only $18,000. In April,
1904, the directors agailf voted $150
a month each to Charles/and James as
salaries, and in June added $100 a
month for Herbert, for whom the of
fice 1 of "building inspector" was cre
ated, although, it is said, there were
no necessary duties for, him to per
form.
On April 29 last another assessment
of $8 a share was levied and Havens
paid the $1600, while the debts of the
company were only $8000.
On June 18, says the complaint, the
Guaranty Loan Company was organ
ized with a capital stock of $100,000,
none of which was oaid in, and the be
lief is expressed that the Goewey
brothers own all the shares and man
age the concern for the purpose of
speculating with the funds of the Goe
wey Company. In that month, it is
charged, the Goewey Company was
out of debt and the conspiring direc
tors voted to loan $9000 to the new
guaranty company, which the Goewey
Company was not able to advance
without borrowing for itself. To get
around this obstacle the Goewey Com
pany borrowed $16,000 in July from
the French Savings Bank, giving a
mortgage to secure it. From this the
$9000 was advanced to the Guaranty
Company and the latter invested the
sum in San Francisco realty.
The $9000 loan was a small begin
ning, according to the complaint, and
on October 28 the Goewey directors
voted that $35,000 more be borrowed
from the French Bank and that
$44,000 be loaned to the Guaranty
Company. Of this latter sum, it is
said, $35,000 has already been paid
and the balance is about to be paid,
and on the strength of the loan the
Guaranty Company is building an
apartment -house "for speculation" on
its $9000 lot.
m;w job pays well.
In August of last year, it is stated,
James resigned the secretaryship of
the company and took the new office
of "managing director" at a salary of
$200 a month, while Loessel was em
ployed as secretary at $15 a month
and later paid $25.
The purpose of all these acts are set
forth as, first, to create a debt, the
payment of which would require an
assessment on Gertrude's stock; sec
ond, that the brothers might use the
funds of the estate to speculate in the
Guaranty Company and receive the
profits to the exclusion of Gertrude's
stock; third, to create a debt against
the Goewey estate which would af
ford a subterfuge for the suspension of
dividends.
Havens asks the court to require an
accounting and the repayment of the
sums paid in excessive salaries and
fraudulently loaned to the Guaranty
Company; that the directors be en
joined from receiving more salaries;
that they be enjoined from levying
assessments to pay the French Bank
loans: that they be declared to have
violated their trust; that they be re

Apparent Discrepancies in
Past and Present Estimates
COST OF LA 808 HIGHEB
Spring Valley Fears to
Invest Large Sums Because
Supervisors Menace It
In the Spring Valley Water Works
case yesterday morning John S. Part
ridge, attorney for the city, read to
Hermann Schussler a communication
stnt to A. J. Bryant, then Mayor of
San Francisco, by Charles Webb How
ard in 187 T. In this communication Mr.
Howard said that the works were cap
able of supplying 20,000,000 gallons of
water daily, and that there were works
then contemplated by the company, to
be completed in th% summer of 1881,
which would supply the city with 50,
000,000 gallons per day at an expense
not exceeding $4,000,000.
Mr. Sehussler was asked how the
company intended to supply 50,000,000
gallons per day at that expense in 1877.
and he said it was the intention at that
time to construct the dam in the Cala
veras Valley and pipe the water to the
city, but he also said that he thought
that the estimate of $4,000,000 must have
been made by consultation with some
other engineer.
He was then asked why the company
did not build the Calaveras works and
why it had omitted to do so up to the
present time. He answered that it was
because the company did not care to
invest a large amount of money for
fear the Supervisors would not allow
rates sufficient to cover the interest.
His attention was called to the fact
that the company had since then ac
quired large tracts of land at Crystal
Springs and on the lower Alameda sys
tem, and had spent In construction
alone a sum vastly in excess of what it
would cost in his own estimate to bring
30,000,000 gallons additional from Cala
veras. His answer to that was that the
company, owing to the parsimony of
the Supervisors, had been obliged to ac
quire properties gradually and add to
the supply a little at a time. He was
then asked if he had not expended
nearly $4,000,000 at Crystal Springs
alone in 1888. He admitted that, but
said that that portion of the system
was acquired as a great central reser
voir for the future.
The witness also said that Mr. How- j
ard was mistaken in estimating the j
water production in 1877 at 20.000.0H0
gallons per day, because at that time ;
the company's works were capable of :
producing only 11,000,000 gallons.
Mr. Partridge called the witness' at
tention to an estimate which he filed
with the Board of Supervisors in 1901.
:n which he stated that the Calaveras
dam would require 350,000 cubic yards
of concrete and that it would cost
$10 per cubic yard. His attention was
then called to his testimony in this
case, in which he stated that it would
cost $14 a cubic yard to build the Cala
veras dam. Mr. Schussler explained
that this increased cost was due to th
increased price of labor, which, he
had said before, cost Â£0 per cent more
now than in 1901.
TO ADJUST WATER RATES.
Supervisors Hold Annual Investiga
tion of Spring Valley Company.
The Board of Supervisors, sitting as 1
a committee of the whole to investi
gate the Spring Valley Water Com
pany and adjust the water rates for
the fiscal year beginning July 1, met
yesterday afternoon at the City Hall.
Dr. D'Ancona acted as chairman and \
Supervisor Brandenstein was appoint- I
ed chief investigator. The hearing j
will last several days.
The Supervisors decided that, as the ;
hoard had been probing exhaustively j
Into the financial standing of the j
water company for the last four i
years, these records should be ad
mitted to the present inquisition and |
considered as part of the evidence. .
Therefore the investigation this time i
will only cover the permanent im
provements of the company acquired '
since June 30, 1904.
The Spring Valley Company sub
mitted a statement signed by its pres
ident. C. W. Howard, and the secre
tary, Pelham W..Ames, showing that
the loss for the fiscal year above men
tioned was $6996 24. The total re
ceipts from water rates, rents, etc.,
were $2,187,436 74, and the disburse
ments of operating expense, coupons,
interest, taxes, etc., were $2,194.
432 98. The loss dated from June 30.
1904, taken from the balance of June.
1903. left a balance June, 1904, of
$184,056 67.
P. W. Ames, the secretary of the
company, and Expert Williams were
placed on the stand to tell of the ac
quisitions of the water company
since July 1. 1804. The company
submitted a statement showing that
the total amount of improved prop
erty acquired since that date is
$437,965 89. The itemized list of a
greater portion of the property is as
follows: Gum Forest, near Lake Mer
ced. 22- acres. $40,980: Colma real
estate right of way, $23,233 40: Ra
venswood. east of Menlo Park, $15.
000; Ashton Tract. $15,000; thirty
six lots In Visltacion Valley. $9850:
Xewhall Tract. near Belmont,
$8247 51: and other properties.
Before the meeting came to order
a delegation from Carville addressed
the board asking for larger mains for
the Oceanside section. They were told
to address the board in a formal way.
The representatives of the water com
pany who were present said that the
conapany was considering changes in
the district.

TO FILE BIDS
ON BOND ISSUE
Indications Point to Pro
posals for $1,500,000 of
the Municipal Securities
FEW SCHOOLS BENEFIT
Koncovieri Shows Remedy
for Reduced Revenue From
New State Apportionment
From information already received
I by the Board of Supervisors, bids to the
amount of about $1,500,000 for the mu
nicipal bond issue will be filed with
j the board at next Monday's meeting.
Chief among the bids will be that of
the State Board of Examiners for a
portion of the school bonds aggregat
ing $294,000, which will be more than
Bufflclent to build the Washington and
Spring Valley schools and another
small building. Other bids to the
amount of $89,000 for school bonds are
also expected to be filed, making a
total of only $383,000 out of $L 077,600
to be sold.
The property owners on Mission,
Fourth and Market streets, headed by
Herbert Law, have succeeded in induo
ing capitalists and banks to submit
bids for street bonds -amounting to
$243,000 and sewer bonds of the value
of approximately $350,000 on condition
that the streets named be improved
forthwith.
In all likelihood hospital bonds
â amounting to $250,000 will be bid for
and President Roncovieri has infor
mation that bids will be filed by the
banks for $278,400 of the issue for the
) purchase of County Jail and addltons
Ito the Hall of Justice bonds. Ron
covieri deprecates the small amount of
I school bonds which will be taken up
| in view of the fact that the notice of
sale invites bids on $1,077,600 of the
same. Roncovieri returned from Sac
ramento bringing advices that the new
apportionment of State school funds
whereby the city of San Francisco will
suffer a loss of $250,000 In school
revenue will be passed by the Legisla
ture and signed by the Governor. The
! only concession made is that the meas
ure will go into effect in September
next Instead of at once, as first con
templated. Roncovieri says the only
j way to restore the original amount of
| revenue from the State is to build new
j schoolhouses so that pupils will be
j encouraged to attend. The new appor-
I tionment Is based on actual attendance
i instead of on the school census as
: heretofore and Roncovieri says the only
I remedy lies in new and better school
i houses.
The notice of sale invites bids on
$2,573,800 of the various securities, leav
i ing $1,000,000, upon which there has
been no intimation given of any bids
I to be filed.

classes, and clocks, of which! there is no
increase in the supply and witch are firmly
held, are, readily manipulated by professional
operator*, aided of course by .' the influences
named above. In case of the coalers activity
Â»as legitimately stimulated by the unusual
prosperity of these companies arising from the
heavy demand for coal at profitable prices. The
promptness with which new bund issues have
been taken is very striking and is due to the
large amount of capital seeking a sure, if
low. return. Most of these new issues have
been for the purpose of. taking up notes issued
a year or two aeo. when the market would not
Utke any more new flotations, while a. portion
have been tor refunding maturing loans; these
developments proving very fortunate for the
railroad companies. Meanwhile the eagern^Â»
of investors for bonds to the neglect of stocks
is almost running into a fad, especially as the
lack of attention to some of the older iow
interest bearing issues shows the neÂ«d of
clow discrimination among bond buyers.
"Abo $70,000,000 of gold has been chipped
from this country within the la*t five months
without exerting any detrimental effect on this
market. In tact, as it ha? gone largely to
frtrenpthen weak spots abroad, the efflux has
been an indirect benefit. More than half of
this amount has gone to Paris, presumably to
fortify French banks jn financing the new Kus
f!an loan of 20<\ 000,000 roubles, for which
plans have- already bee* completed."
Cotton and toffee.

tÂ«-rda> eaid: . '
COTTON â The market was quiet but firmer,
with prices at one time showing an advance
of 7 points from yesterday's close. The
eirtngth was due largely to much better mar
kets at Livertjool than expected, in view of
the 12 to 15 point drop yesterday. The mar
ket looks favorable for t-mall, quick turns.
V.'ould advise purchasing on breaks . and sell
:ng on email advances. There seems to -be
r.j pressure from the epot markets on future
options and there will not be lor tome time
to come, as 00 any decline in futures spots
show a disposition to advance. It i* reported
that the bull leader of New Orleans .- pre
paring to demand delivery of March cotton
contracts In that city, rinding the difference so
much greater than actual cotton. There ib a
good demand for spot. If any contracts were
d< manded here the ehorts would find serious
trouble in getting under cover The market
hi the late trading was quiet, with a very
eteady undertone."
COFFEE â The coffee market showed a re
ai tionary tendency following, the "recent severe
â¢â ;.-. i!nÂ«s and opened steady at an advance of
.'â¢ points, afterward increasing the gain to 10 i
: -r.-i- on the active months." .Trading was
not particularly active, but demand was of a
very pood character and seemed to ; reflect not
only little covering by local chorts but also
8 continued demand by interests . which have
confidence. . . â  â

New York Stock Market.
KETW YORK. Feb. lft. â The stock market's
â¢bow of spotty strength was about the same
to-day, as yecterday. except that some different
stock* were aflected. In some cases it was
e.l>parent itiat the movements were due to
opÂ« ratifies by pools In the particular stocks.
In * , some other stocks news or rumors
offeree ground for higher prices. Low priced
Industrials continued to play a conspicuous
part In the market and In the railroad list
the low-priced non-dividend paying stocks
aunt into greater favor. Stocks of the Mor
â Tas group. Including United States Eteel com
mon and Rock Island, were examples in this
class. The absence of news to account for
thÂ« speculative movement gave rise to the
euppoaltion that they were designed for effect
upon sentiment by creating an Impression of
an active interest in the market on the pert
of the great capitalists. Union Pacific ad
vanced a^ain to slightly above its high price
of yesterday. But the failure of a Stock Ex
cbange house which was said to be due to
uncovered commitments on the short side
of the market was believed to explain to some
extent- yesterday's sharp rise In Union Pa
cific The strength of the stock in conse
quence did not hold throughout th* day. There
was. however, a corresponding advance to a
new' record price for Northern Securities on
the curb and buyers of the stocks professed
confidence that an early Increase In the Union
Pacific <llvidfÂ«d rate was in contemplation.
Yesterday*" /rumors of a transfer of control
of â¢ Ontario and Western to the New York
. Crntrai' were denied on authority, but that
rtock continued to show strength and the mi
nority interests were eaid to have faith that
t'hev would be granted . lucrative terms. The
decline in exchange rates continued and money
aÂ» In abundant supply. The time 1* â  now
approaching, however, .when the tide of the
currency -movement from the interior, is ap-
To*.cfcins the â  turn ac is â  Indicated by the de
< line in the Interior rates for exchange on
New. York. Tble periodical course -of the
iiring money markets is a natural restrictive
influence on - speculation fri storks and there
iÂ« a tendency- to anticipate It even bsfore It
6<jt* develop. Great attention and active dls
Â«ujÂ«*ion were given to the contest for control
of the encrmous resources of one of the great
UTVv insurance companies. Aeide from the per
ennaJ phase â of the contest and of the - merits
of -the dispute over the â¢manner of adminicter

nf-rs canned by the atnigSle la witness to the

was the *ugccsted possibility of a . crisis ; in
our relations with Venezuela. Further, cuts
were announced on freight rates in the pro-
BreEs of the war for export traffic and there
were complaints of freight obstruction from
the etormy weather. An uncertain tone de
veloped in consequence and the sharp selling
movement of the last hour wiped out about
all of tit* gains and established a few sharp
losses.

very little butine -s transacted during the day, ,
as the stormy weather kept buyers away. The
market was slenderly supplied with OnionÂ»
and dealers were indifferent about parting with
their holdings.

Poultry and Game.
Trade in Poultry was hampered by the
heavy rainstorm and a good portion of the
day's arrivals had to be held over. Dealers
v.ere not Inclined to force sales, however, and
prices of all descriptions were well maintained.
Sixteen cases of dressed Turkeys came in and
met with a sluggish demand at a wide range
In prices. The season for Wild Ducks having
ended, there was very little Interest mani
fested in Game, and Geese. Hare and Rabbits,
which constituted the bulk of the offerings,
were Slow of sale.

Butter. Cheese and FÂ«rjr*-
There is no further decline in Buttt-r and
some houses report the movement somewhat
better. Others, who arc overstocked, continue
very weak and are making concessions. It Is
estimated that practically all the recent lisMJ
stock of cold-storage goods has been shipped
East during the past several months, leaving
only a little, and that is held by retailers who
want to use it themselves. Some of this cold
storage stock, according to street report, was
held here for several years and was very In
ferlor.i This Eastern demand for cold-storage
goods 'was a great boon to- the market.
Cheese continue* in comparatively light sup
ply, and steady.

ket is heavily supplied and dull and the feel-

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Owing to the inclement weather the dullness
in fresh fruits was more pronounced than ever
yesterday and there were fey; buyers on the
market. In laot, there was not enough busi
ness transacted to warrant any change in the
quotations. Five cars of Oransee are at hand
for to-day's auction, but In view of the un
favorable weather and market conditions it is
doubtful whether the sale will be held.

POLICE BOARD APPARENTLY BENT ON OUSTING CHIEF WITTMAN
BECAUSE HE DID NOT STOP THE FANTAN GAMES IN CHINATOWN
Choice oj Successor Being Discussed Already
To-Dau Secretary
Will Prepare
. Charges.
Captain Spillane
Takes Command
of Force.
It look? as if the Police Commission
err virtually have their minds made up
to oust rhief of Poifoe Wittman from
his hisrh office. The evidence adduced in
the trial af Sergeant Ellis is held to
be conclusive proof that the head of
the department is respOsssWe for the
re of the department to suppress
ling in Chinatown and that he
has therefore been negligent and in-
BteÃt, as was charged by Com
ner Reagan at Wednesday even
mating bC the board.
â¢ ady the discussion is on in earn
â rtsMÃ the board will appoint
tnnan's successor. There was a
-ence between the < Virr.miseioners
- hmitz yesterday of two
h<'urs= duration and it is understood
that the matter of selecting a new
Chief of Police was gone into, although
no effort at reaching a CMsChsstoa was
made.
Everything will be all right." was
the confident statement of Wittman
]act eveninp He does not appear to
entertain any misgiving as to the out
come of his trial. He called at his of
fices once during tht day, where he
found Captain John Ppillane in charge,
iing to the direction of the com
â¢ night before that the senior
loulrf take command of the
'.ment during the suspension of
the Chief pending disposition of his
HOVXK TO PREPARE CHARGES.
J. | . - >yne. secretary to the
T'. -lice Commission, did not take any
â¢ rday to prepare the charges
tt Chief Wittman as directed to
. the resolution of the board the
night before. He will probably make
:he complaint to-day.
"There is no hurry in the matter,"
said the secretary, "and I want to have
a talk with President Poheim and Com
missioner Reagan before preparing the
specifications. The motien of Reagan
merely directed that I prepare charges
rig neglect of duty and incom
y. but in the formal statement
of the <harges the issues must be clear
ly drawn as to the existence of gam
bling in Chinatown and the time desig
nated for whifrh evidence is available
that the fantan games were alloYed to
run.
'According to the charter an accused
member of the department has five
days in which to make his plea. Then
the commission has a rule that trials
shall be- heard <m a certain day of the
week. The case against the Chief can
therefore not be callefl at least before
February 24. It will likely be several
weeks before the case is ended."
POHI.IM ASSURES FAIR TRIAL.
â¢ Chief Wittman is entitled to a fair
and impartial trial and he shall have
it." declared President Poheim of the

commission. "I regard him as a bril
liant director of police affairs and think
it would be difficult to find a man to
fill the position as well. There has
been no decision whatever on the suc
cessor of Wittman should he be dis
missed.
"It is a question what the standing
of the Chief would bÂ« in the depart
ment should he be dismissed from the
head of the department. The charter
is not clear whether his connection
with the force would be entirely sever
ed or only his rank affected. He might
still be a member of the department
and our authority restricted to reduc
ing him in rank, should it be estab
j lished merely that he is incompetent
to serve as Chief."
So far there is only one avowed can
d'date for the vacancy should it be
made. That is Jeremiah Dinan. now
â  detective sergeant. He is a close
personal friend of the Mayor, but has
no important influence with any mem
bers of the commission, which has the
say in the matter. Mayor Schmitz,
however, as the leader of the adminis
tration would be expected to have a
voice in the disposition of so import
ant an appointment.
It is not believed, however, that
Dinan would be the man, notwith

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1905.
POLICE OFFICIAL WHO IS ACTING CHIEF OF THE DEPARTMENT DURING
THE SUSPENSION OF CHIEF GEOKGB W. WITTMAN. CHARGED WITH IN
COMPETENCY AND NEGLECT OF DUTY BT THE COMMISSIONERS.
casion arises the Commissioners will
look outside the department for the
man to take supreme command.
SCHMITZ IS NOT THE MAX.
The announcement was made yes
terday that the stories that Herbert
Schmitz, former Public Works Com
missioner and brother of the Mayor,
was a possibility, were absolutely
without foundation. Another person
mentioned as likely to be the new
Chief is George Boyne, now the com
mission's secretary. But the denials
come as vigorously in regard to him
as to Schmitz. The source of the de
nials is a prominent factor in the
Schmitz administration.
John Seymour, who resigned the po
sition of captain of detectives a few
years ago to accept a more lucrative
position with the Fair estate, is said
to be nursing an ambition to become
Chief of Police. He took a prominent
part in the recent investigation of
Chinatown corruption by the Grand
Jury and it is said that his urglngs
were in large part responsible for the
confession of Sergeant Ellis, wherein
it was shown that a big corruption
fund was raised every week among
the fantan games to purchase Im
munity from police interference. Cap
tain Martin is said to be working in
Seymour's interest, with a view to re
gaining the position of captain of de
tectives, from which Wittman recently
deposed him.
Public Works Commissioner Frank
Maestrettl had a talk with Commis
sioner Poheim yesterday in regard to
the course of the Police Board. A ru
mor was started during the day that
he was a candidate for the place of
Chief. Captain Duke of the Central
station also let his umbrella drippings
wet the fine carpet of Dr. Poheim's
office during the afternoon.
COMMISSIONERS PROVOKED.
Commissioners Drinkhouse and Rea
gan were not at their offices yesterday
and successfully eluded those who
sought interviews with them. It is
known, however, that they were pro
voked to the step against Chief "Witt
man by the reflections cast upon them
In the Grand Jury's report of the con
fession of Sergeant Ellis and of corrup
tion in Chinatown. They were virtually
held accountable for the conditions
there, whereas they believe that the re
sponsibility devolves upon the should
ers of the Chief, who was specifically
charged with the suppression of the
fantan games. Their action against
Wittman is largely to place the blame
where they think it belongs and to free
themselves of \he aspersions the Grand
Jury made.
The following is the excerpt of the
Grand Jury report that seems to have
stirred all the trouble:
That your committee is unabl* to state for
â¢what period of time and under what sergeants
the system of corruption has iJontinued. hut
believe* that It has been carried along In the
department for a number of years, and that
th<" squads hereinbefore mentioned have fol
lowfl In the footsteps of certain of Its pre
decessori.
Your commute* is positive that a vigilant
cquad of police, commanded by an honest and
competent sergeant, can at all times enforce
tht law in Chinatown or In any other portion
of thin city. ThlfÂ» has been proven by the ac
tions of certain sergeants who have been sent
to Chinatown to uphold the law during the last
four or five years.
For the department to confess that any part
oC this city is immune from the carrying out
of tht ordinances of the city or the statutes
of the State, so far as concerns gambling or
other crime, we hold to be absolutely unten
able, and a confession of weakness upon the
part of the department making the admission.
The Board of Police- Commissioners, specifical
ly charg-ed with the duty of seeing that cor
ruption docs not creep into the department
and to eradicate it when It gains a foothold,
admitted In the report filed In the month of
December last, that th^re were over 100 places
in Chinatown where gambling has been con
ducted during many years last past.
OIGIIT TO STOP FANTAN.
It seems to ub that they could also have
discovered why this wholesome violation of the
law was permute,! and have taken the neces
sary steps to prevent the same. We believe
that with the machinery which they have at
hand the work should have been easier for
them than it has been for the Grand Jury.
We regret exceedingly that our urgent ap
peal for furtherMlme was not granted, and
to such refusal of the Police Commission to
delay '.ts investigation that we might not be
interfered with in ours we lay the responsibil
ity tnr our failure to adduce evidence that
would convict the guilty parties in a court
of law.
At the trial of Wittman, Captain
Spillane, as the acting Chief, will have
the unenviable position of prosecutor
before the commission of his superior.
The fact that Spillane was made the
temporary appointee does not indicate
any purpose of the board to make him
Chief. He was the senior captain, and
in the regular order of things he was
placed in command. The temporary
Chief has been a member of the depart
ment since 1881, and was promoted at
the same time Wittman was to the
rank of captain â in 1895.
Wittman was appointed Chief in No
vember, 1901, and his term would end
regularly in the same month of the
present year.

STATESMEN GET
TWO SALARIES
Attorney Webb Rules in
Favor of Paying Welch
and Strohl for January
GRAIN AT THE SEAWALL
New Schedule Imposing Tax
of Five Cents a Ton to
Be Formulated by Board
The State Board of Examiners re
jected from the January bills of the
State Board of Harbor Commissioners
allowances of $100 to Assemblyman
Strohl, as Collector, and $250 to Senator
Welch, as Chief Wharfinger. The Com
missioners were yesterday advised by
Charles F. Curry, Secretary of State,
and a member of the Board of Exam
iners that Attorney General Webb had
ruled that the rejection of the demands
was without warrant of law. The sec
retary of the Harbor Commission was
therefore directed to place the January
demands of Strohl and Welch on the
February roll.
The Harbor Commissioners yester
day, on motion of Commissioner Mac
kenzie, rescinded the order of Au
gust 3, 1904, revoking permits for sev
eral merchants to sell perishable prod
ucts on the ' wharves. The revocation
was rescinded on proper assurance
from the merchants that the letter and
spirit of the Woodward act relating to
the sale of produce on the wharves of
the State would be fully respected.
G. L. Blair, H. Erlanger and M. Fer
guson, representing grain men, with
Commissioners Spear, Mackenzie and
Kirkpatrick, discussed at considerable
length the proposition to place a small
tax on grain and flour unloaded at the
seawall. The Commissioners insist
that grain and flour shall pay a slight
duty in order that the vast extent of
sheds on the seawall may be kept in
repair. The topic of competition with
northern ports was dwelt upon. It was
asserted that Portland, Tacoma and
Seattle gave three months' storage for
grain at 40 cents a ton. The discussion
disclosed the fact that the Southern
Pacific allowed grain in the cars at the
Oakland yard to remain thirty days
without extra charge.
The grain men predicted that the
crop this year would be large, and
much grain would come to the seawall.
Mr. Erlanger asked the board to allow
the present rule to stand.
It was finally agreed that a schedule
should be formulated imposing a
charge of 2% cents a ton on grain dis
charged at the seawall and 2Vfc cents a
ton additional for twenty-five days'
storage on the wall after the grain had
been moved back to permit the dis
charge of other freight. There is to be
no charge on flour consigned here for
export through the Golden Gate. Flour
and millstuffs for home use must pay 5
cents a ton.
A contract for building a scow driver
was awarded to the lowest bidder,
Healy, Tibbitts & Co. r at $2693.

the request of many of the club mem
bers James W. Erwin, a former pres

sition will present more than 150

CITY PROPERTY
Real Estate Board Expands
and Becomes Organization
for Brokers and Owners
Members of the San Francisco Real
Estate Board have determined to re
organize that body into a permanent
board for the promotion of all the in
terests of dealers in and owners of city
real estate. The first move toward
permanent organization was made yes
terday afternoon, when many of the
largest dealers in realty in San Fran
cisco came together at Assembly hall,
Mills building, and transacted business
of importance.
At this meeting- by-laws were adopted
providing for two classes of member
ship; one to be known as "active," em
bracing all active real estate agents
and brokers, and the other an associ
ate-member class, intended \o include
property owners and those interested
who are not engaged in the brokerage
business. The following well known
firms enrolled themselves as mem
bers at the initial meeting:
Madison & Burke, Thornae Majee & Sons,
Bovee. Toy & Co., O. H. Umbsen & Co., BaJd
win & Howell, Shainwald. Buckbe.e & Co.,
Yon Rheln Real Estate Company, Davidson A

bers, John T. Harmes. Frederick Ma
gee, George D. Toy, H. P. Umbsen, J.
R. Howell. Samuel G. Buckbee. David
Rich, E. L. Hoag and C. M. Wooster.
was elected. These directors met im
mediately after the adjournment of the
general meeting and organized by elect
ing J. R. Howell, president; John T.
Harmes, vice president; Samuel G.
Buckbee, treasurer. B. L. Cadwalader.
the secretary of the Chamber of Com
merce, was elected permanent secre
tary of the organization, which will
hereafter have its headquarters and
hold its meetings at the rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce.
The organization is intended to watch
legislation affecting property rights,
landlords and tenants, and all munici
pal ordinances concerning buildings,
and, in fact, to promote all matters of
general interest to the property own
ers of this city.
The first measure adopted by the or
ganization was the passage of a resolu
tion in opposition to the Stanton oral
contract bill now before the Senate in
Sacramento.
Regular meetings of the board of di
rectors are provided for and the or
ganization premises to be a strong one,
inasmuch as many large property hold
ers in this city have already signified
their intention of becoming associate
members. *
Killed by Propeller.
Michael Carmody, a motorman 3S
years' old. jumped off the ferry-boat
Berkeley shortly after 3 o'clock
terday afternoon. He was rCMTMd
quickly, but not before the propeller
had mangled him so badly that he
died soon after at the Harbor Hos
pital. He was supposed to be insane.
WTMAN MUST STAY IN JAILâ The Su
preme Court yesterday denied a petition for
a writ of habeas corpus in favor of â¢ "harles
â \Vyman, the convicted ballot box stuffer. The
defendant sought hlÂ» freedom on the ground
that the primary election law was invalid.
The denial of the petition does not. however,
settle the question as to 'the validity of thÂ»
disputed statute.
