DENVER, Oct- 5.â A Republican spe
cial from Las Vegas. X. M.. says that
there was another heavy rain in tha
mountains above the city to-day, and
word came from up the river that a
two-foot rise was coming down. There
is great anxiety in the city, as the river
is still out of its channel, and it re
quires but a comparatively small rise
to send the stream through the busi
ness section. The ravages of the pre
vious storms have not been fully re
paired, and it is feared that another
flood would render useless the results
already accomplished.
The bodies of two women and a child,
which have not yet been identified,
were found to-day.
Information arriving slowly from the
flooded district in Mora Couatv shows
that almost the entire rich Trujillo Val
ley has been devastated. A lake cov
ering nearly 800 acres now stands
where once were fertile fanns.

Slowly his antagonist closed In upon
the outclassed quarry, a mountain of
muscle and horns cornering the smaller
creature closer and closer as the mo
ments sped.
As his herculean antagonist pressed
almost within^ horning distance the
doomed young" buck sprang high in the
air and tried to escape, but he was
caught full on his enemy's sharp horns
and pressed tightly against the wall,
blood gushing from his wounds as ha
bellowed in pain:
For a few minutes the younger buck
fought spasmodically, -desperately ; but
again and again his old Samson of an
antagonist pierced and gored him with
out mercy. Even when down and
bleeding, however, the young buck
gamely resisted the vicious onslaughts
of his conqueror, but it was like fight
ing a locomotive.
Stubbornly and with diabolical feroc
ity old Jack gored his dying adversary,
and it was with difficulty that he could
be caged, even when his enemy lay
dead.
It is several weeks before the bucks
are due to run, but close confinement
probably intensified old Jack's rage.
Had ordinary precautions been used
the loss of one of the park's great at
tractions would have been prevented. A
valuable elk was^ killed las^ year in
a similar way.
The vicious Instinct that develops
itself when savage males meet in jun
gle or mountain fastness made Golden
Gate Park its theater yesterday, and,
though keepers and onlookers tried to
prevent a fatal termination of the en
counter, the result was as swift and
merciless as that of any contest be
tween savage hoofs and horns that
ever stained the foliage or broke the
silence of a virgin forest.
In moving the deer from one padr
deck to another two males were care
lessly allowed to meet. They were of
unequal size, and strength and in the
inevitable fight that followed the weak
er animal was so gored and injured
that a keeper mercifully cut the
wounded creature's throat to end its
miseries.
Jack, one of the older bucks, had been
confined for two days in an inclosure
and adjoining htm was a smaller deer.
A. narrow passageway connected the
two and through this the animals were
to -be driven reparatil v Into a
cage. The powerful Jack was let into
t*he other's corral and as soon as he
beheld the smaller buck his rage flamed
high and the instinct of murder seized
him like a fever of the blood.
The overmatched buck seemed to
realize that his hour had come, and he
was overcome with a panic of fear. He
looked for a moment upon the monster
horned Jeffries that ' confronted him,
then raced madly about the inclosure.
throwing himself violently against the
wire screen.
There was a duel to death between
two savage buck deer in Golden Gate
Park paddock yesterday afternoonâ a
rare sight for the few spectators pres
ent. Just such a battle as the Iroquois
and Algonqulns delighted in witnessing
as a common sport when the Jesuit
fathers first penetrated the untrodden
wilds of Morth America.

in the Richmond district. The saloon of
J. T. Meinhart was entered by a
masked man and the proprietor and his
patrons in the cardroom were relieved
of their money, amounting to nearly
$175. The highwayman secured $100
from the two cash registers in the place
and the remainder from those In the
saloon at the time.
.About 9 o'clock last night the robbery
took place. The robber was masked by
a .haridkerchief drawn across the lower
part of his. face, and a brown hat was
pulled over 'his eyes. As he entered he
leveled a revolver and told those In the
place tothrqw up their hands.
, f All ; of the men complied with the
cool request with the exception of W.
A. Brown,. who is hard of hearing. With
an oath the highwayman quickly re
versed his pistol and struck Brown two
swift blows on the head. Brown
dropped to the floor and the robber
took deliberate aim "at the prostrate
man and was about to pull the trigger

should pursue. He got into Jackass

BOSTON, Oct. - 5.â Resolutions in
tended to bring about an end to the
Russo-Japanese war were adopted to
day at the meeting of the International
Peace Congress. By the terms of the
resolutions the congress will address
an appeal to the Emperors of Russia
and Japan to terminate the struggle,
and each of the powers signatory to
The Hague convention will be formally
requested to press upon Russia and
Japan the importance of putting an end
to the present war.
It was also voted that the resolu
tions referring to friendly intervention
by the powers be presented to Presi
dent Roosevelt by a committee of the
congress. The resolutions were passed
after a lengthy discussion, in which
many of the most prominent foreign
delegates participated. ,.
Delegate William R. Cremer of Eng
land took occasion, while favoring the
declarations, to characterize the treaty
between England and Japan as a blun
der and to charge that this treaty
doubtless had much, to do with .bring
ing on the Russo-Japanese war. There
upon. Great- Britain's; policy of being
a party tojthe treÂ«.ty__was _vlgorously,

: The deliberative' proceecUngS:*of -thd
day took on an added interest ..' from
the fact that a' leading Hindoo, Baba
Bharati, was introduced to speak as
the representative of his country. The
most intense applause that' has been
evoked thus far during the convention
greeted the Hindoo, who, dressed in
the costume of his people, delivered a
passionate speech in excellent English,
denouncing on the . one hand the at
tempt of Christianity to thrust Chris
tianity upon India as its religion, and
the policy of the English people of In
dia in invading Tibet.
It was voted during the session to
refer the subject of a reconciliation of
France and Germany on the Alsace-
Lorraine question to the Berne bureau
for study by a special committee.
Part of the phraseology of the cable
gram prepared to be sent to Andrew
Carnegie was objected to by a delegate
from New York, and it was finally re
written, so that Carnegie was hailed as
an earnest worker in the world's "bet
ter political order," instead of a worker
for the world's "just and rational or
ganization."
Three public meetings under the aus
pices of the congress were held to
night. One was for workingmen in
Faneuil Hall, where the principal
speaker was Samuel Gompers, presi
dent of the American Federation of La
bor. At Park-street church a meeting
was held by the women delegates to the

LONDON.' Oct. 5.â Joseph Chamber-
Iain reopened his fiscal campaign at
Luton. Bedfordshire, to-night. The
Duke of Bedford presided. The audito
rium in which Chamberlain spoke had
been specially erected in the outskirts
of the town in order to accommodate a
large crowd, but its seating capacity
was taxed to the utmost.
Chamberlain began his speech with
an eloquent tribute to the late Sir Wil
liam Vernun Harcourt and said there
was no member of Parliament regard
less cf party but would sincerely and
deeply regTet the passing of that great
political leader.
On the fiscal proposition. Chamber
lain said it was not a party question,
but affected every vital interest of the
country. He dwelt at considerable
length on the agricultural situation and
painted a gloomy picture of present
conditions, predicted that there is
worse to come and said agriculture had
been crippled and land values shrunk
by hundreds of millions.
The capital of farmers, he said, had
fallen one billion dollars. There are
now fewer laborers by a million than
in 1831. and 18,000.000 people are under
fed, while the people of America, Ger
many and other foreign countries are
prosperous and surpassing Great Brlt
tin in every line of trade and business.
He- said that to <leny existing'condi
tions was impossible and to ignore them
would be criminal.
Alluding to ' Balfour's Edinburgh
speech. Chamberlain said he did not
Â¦want the protection of fifty years ago,
but he did want to make foreigners pay
toll on shipments to the British mar
ket, and unless Great Britain and her
colonies worked together there was
nothing in sight but disintegration of
the empire. Chamberlain said that
Balfour> statement concerning a con
ference with the colonies marked a dis
tinct advance, but Balfour should not
delay: he should call the conference at
once and see what terms could be
made with the colonies.
Chamberlain saw only one blemish
in Kalfour's proposal. That was. the
Premier seemed to think It would be
necersary. after the conference had ar
rived at an agreement, to take a sec
ond election. Chamberlain saw no need
of a second plebiscite and foresaw use-,
less and endless delay before the agree
ment was submitted to the respective
Parliaments if they had to wait until
evpry legislator at home and in the
colonies were re-elected.

able men to work for It in the spirit that

Letter of Congratulation
From Roosevelt Received
With Three Hearty Cheers
Just as he iraa about to take the
train from Carson Senator Fairbanks
was presented with an elaborately
carved silver and horn cane by L. H.
Rogers of the local Roosevelt Club.
In this city to-night the Senators ad
ds f-ssed all the people who could crowd
irto the Grand Theater and the de
mend for admittance made it evident
that a much larger hall could have
beeÂ» filled. The meeting was marked
by a high degree of enthusiasm and the
applause was frequent and pronunced.
Ex-Chief Justice Massey presided. The
addresses were again along general
lines, and again the people of this
State were urged to give their sunr
port to the Republican party as most
calculated to promote the State's best
interests.
Senator Fairbanks presented the
claims of his party to the support of
the people because of its record as
a business organization. He said:
The Republican party is harmonious. There
Is no conflict of sesthnent, either oa rnea*
orei or â¢Â¦ith respect to oar candidate for thÂ«
Presidency. Republican triumph will laaur*
the country that the administration of publio
affairs will not be embarrassed by warring
factions. No President can successfully ad
minister the Government who does not have
back of him the loyal and intelligent support
cf a it re* i party fitted to govern: no President
iÂ« wise and able enough to succeed without
the cordial and united ' support of his party
associate*, and no President can fail to Rive
to th* country a successful administration
who has the Intelligent and "united Eupport of
a creat party.
ThÂ» opposition is composed of discordant
elerr.frits. It Is sharply divided upon impor
tant issues, and its leadership is not supported
with entire unanimity.
Republican triumph will mean the success of
a united party, thoroughly dedicated to the
sur^ort of wUe and well-known policies. All
of the great departments of the Government
will be in control of men skilled in the ad
ministration of public affairs, and who will
co-operate in the advancement of the country
to the fullest possible degree in thÂ« ways of
peace and prosperity. It Â»Â« essential to have
not only a sound President, but a sound, har
monious party back of htm.

Discussing at the same place the
*Â»ut-6tlon of Irrigation Senator Fair
banks made reference to the fact that
the Democratic party had in its plat
form laid claim to the paternity of the
existing reclamation statute and had
designated it as the "Newlands law."
.This claim he pronounced to be with
out foundation because, he continued.
President Roosevelt deserved in the
main the credit for that most impor
tant legislation-
In his speeches at CarÂ»on and Vrr

that party to maintain prosperity In

Ex-Senator James K. Jones of Ar
kansas saw Judge Parker to-day and
after the conference announced that
he will give his undivided time to
Judge Parker in any way ho can bÂ«
of service. Jones ridiculed stories
started a week ago that he had with
drawn his support from the national
ticket. He said Nevada and Montana
are Democratic and that reports are
favorable from Colorado, Idaho, Wyo
ming and Washington.
So far as* these States are concerned,
he said, a great deal of hard work on
the part of tha campaign committee
will be necessary. He said he was not
hopeful of carrying Washington for
the national ticket, but that he be
lieved former Senator Turner. thÂ«
Democratic candidate for Governor,
will be elected.
Representative Van Duser of Ne
vada talked with Judge Parker con
cerning the campaign in his State and
told the Judge he would start at once
for Nevada, where he will make
speeches daily until election day.
Other members of Congress who
called to-day were Representatives

Believes Democrats Have Still Some
Chance in the West.
The committee soon returned and
presented the names of A. R. Ahlborn
and E. T. McMurray for consideration.
Mr. Ahlborn said that he did not de
sire to stand in the way of Mr. McMur
ray if he desired to accept the honor at
the hands of the club, and he put a mo
tion that the report of the committee
be amended by the striking out of his
name. At his earnest request the mo
tion to amend prevailed and Mr. Mc-
Murray. was agreed upon.
Assisted by A. R. Ahlborn, J. J.Cas
sidy, William Hampton, W. H. Hazell,
Wallace Bradford. C. S. Brundage and
J. T. Terry, Mr. McMurray will imme
diately begin the, work of preparing his

cheers for McMurray and the renewal
of promises to him that every man of

the last election proved traitors to their party,
as they had done many times before, delegate*
to the municipal convention were placed on the
ticket whose interests were those of Ruef and
Maestretti. and then these men were elected
by the most flagrant fraud. , The ballot boxes
of the district were stuffed and we were beaten
not by fair means, but by foul. This we will
not tolerate, and we are here to show thess
men that here these methods will not be toler
ated. â¢ .
Judge John R. Aitken, president of
the club, explained the situation to the
club in terms. that would permit of no
misconstruction. He said:
- We have met here to-night, not to express
disapproval of any Republican principles In
volved Id the. present situation, but to reaffirm
our allegiance to Republican principles by con
demning in no uncertain terms the dishonest
action of certain bosses who. In a manner any
thing but Republcan, robbed us of the right to
say who our candidate for the Assembly
should be.
Resolved, That It la for the best in
terests of the Republican party and
tho Thirty-ninth Assembly District for
the Independent Republican Club of
the district to initiate a movement for
the nomination of an independent Re
publican candidate, for the Thirty
ninth Assembly .District. â¢
ATTKEN MAKES STATEMENT.""
The selection of McMurray to repre
sent . the independent Republicans of
the district was preceded by a warm
discussion as to the advisability of
placing an Independent candidate for
the Assembly in the field. No one seri
ously opposed the move, but those that
favored it were unsparing in their criti
cism of the methods of the men that
had made their action - necessary. Be
fore the discussion was taken up, how
ever, a resolution under which the
meeting was called and stating Its pur
pose was presented and adopted. This
resolution follows:
An independent Republican candidate
for the Assembly-will be put in the field
in the Thirty-ninth Assembly District
in opposition to T. Ej. Atkinson, nomi
nee of the Republican organisation,
and, of course, the Democratic candi
date. At a meeting of the United Inde
pendent Republican Club of the district
named, held last night at .Fourth ave

McMurray, who resides at 329 Sixth

were this court permitted to disregard the de
cision of the special tribunal and Investigate
and determine the merits of the controversy
from that standpoint. It has no right to decide
or suggest. Duly constituted authority having
spoken within its Jurisdiction, it must be con
clusively presumed here to have spoken rightly.
1C. Section 85 of the statutes contemplated
in all cases mentioned therein of conflicting
claims as to the use on the official ballot of
a party designation.' that one set of the claim
ants shall be given preference \ thereto and
each of the others have a place upon the bal
lot under a designation sufficiently definite
from that accorded to the rightful claimant
of the particular designation to enable the
electors , to distinguish such set of Irregular
from the regular nominations.
17. The tribunal created by law to determine
the factional dispute In question for the guid
ance of the Secretary of State having as
sumed jurisdiction thereof and decided, free
from jurlsdlctlonal Infirmities, that the nomi
nations headed by Robert M. La Follette for
Governor are entitled to preference In re
spect to the use upon the official ballot of the
name "Republican ticket," it is the daty of
the Secretary of State to act accordingly,
certifying. both i>etÂ« of nominations to the va
rious county clerks, but giving to those headed
by Robert M. La Follette for Governor prefer
ence as aforesaid. *
USE OF PARTY DESIGNATION.
12. The tribunal answering to the call of
said sect ten 35 is found to exist In the Re
publican State Central Committee elected at
the State convention of 1902. and duly certified
to the Secretary of State under section 31 of
the Statutes, therefore Jurisdiction of this
court is limited to deciding whether such com
mittee was or ia without Jurisdiction because
of bias or interest of some of Its members, or
whether its decision Is affected by Jurtsdlo
tlonal defects.
13. Such tribunal, though required to act
Judicially being an administrative rather than
a Judicial body, bias or Interest ot Its mem
bers does not disqualify them nor affect its
Jurisdiction.
14. The decision of the National Kepubiican
Convention as to which of the two sets of dele
gates from this State claiming the right to
represent the Republican party thereof In
such convention was entitled to recognition
is not of any significance to the Secretary of
State or to the committee authorised to deter
mine the factional dispute under said sec
tion 35 since exclusive Jurisdiction thereof as
regards the official ballot law was conferred
by the Legislature upon the latter as a special
tribunal, as before Indicated.
15. As soon as the nominations were made
by the conventions and duly certified rights of
nominees to places upon official ballot under
designation "Republican ticket" became vest
ed in them aa representatives of their respec
tive organtiatlonn, subject to the decision of
the special tribunal aforesaid, as to which of
the conventions was regular and such right
could therefore not be in any way affected
by the determination of any other tribunal.
11. The creation of a tribunal to determine
such controvers.es, no provisions being made
for a Judicial review of Its decisions, neces
istrily makes Its Jurisdiction exclusive and Its
decisions unimpeachable, except for Jurfsdlc
tlonal defects.
DECISIONS UNIMPEACHABLE.
(c> Such nominations were duly certified.
(d) Kach of said conventions claimed to be
the regular convention ot the Republican
party.
10. It was competent for the Legislature, in
authorization of official ballot and In granting
to the party nominees a right to have, their
names placed thereon under the party desig
nation, to subject that right. In case of contro
versy between two or more sets of nominees.
each claiming the same and such designation,
to the decision of the party tribunal as In
said section 35.
9. The present controversy comes clearly
within the second clause of said section 85,
answering, as it does, every call thereof:
(a) Two conventions were held.
' (b) Each ot said conventions made nomina
tions. ."'.
7. The first clause of section 32. Statutes of
1888, cannot apply to this case, because th*
dominant feature thereof is the existence of a
multifarious "claim to the same party name,"
dtterrninable. as before Indicated, by the cer
tifying officer from his own records, showing
the necessary source of regularity.
8. While tha dominant feature of such first
clause is the existence of a. multifarious "claim
to the same party name." one of such claims
only being based on the "call of the regularly
constituted party authorities." the dominant
feature of the second clause Is the existence
of a multifarious "claim to thÂ» sajna paxty
name," based on a like claim of the regularity
of the party convention, each of the claimants
referring necessarily to the "call of the ree
ularly constituted party authorities," as in
the case In hand. Â¦. -~-
(5. Tho first clause provides for a case where
only one of two or more conventions Is claimed
to have been bald upon the call of the regu
lar party committee and. the 'â¢ Identity of that
one is. therefore, not In doubt. Tha second
clause provides for a case where all of the
conventions are claimed to have been held
pursuant to the call cf such and the eama
committee by creating a tribunal to decide
for guidance for the Secretary of State which
set of nominees Is regular, and therefore en
titled to uae of the party name, such a tri
bunal possessing by familiar rules exclusive
and final Jurisdiction, save as hereafter stated.
DUTY OP PARTY TRIBUNAL.
(A)â "in case of a division In any- political
party, and a claim by two or more factions
thereof to the same party bum, the officer
with whom the certificates of nomination are
required to be filed shall, in certifying such
lamination or preparing ballots, give prefer
ence* of name to the convention or caucus
thereof held pursuant to the call of the regu
larly constituted party authorities, and if the
committee representing the other faction pre
sent no other party name such officer may
designate the name , in such manner as will
best distinguish the nominations thereof.
(B) â "When two or more conventions or cau
cuses shall be held and the nominations rheieot
certified, eaoh claiming to be the regular con
vention or caucus of the same political party,
preference In designation shall be given to the
nominations of the one certified by the com
mittee, which h*d been officially certified to
be authorized to represent the party."
5. The Legislature Intended to provide for
.settlement out of court of all questions between
factions of a party concerning the right to
place the party named upon tha official bal
lot, by section 35, Wisconsin Statutes. In these
words: >
FACTIONAL DISPUTES.
1. The controversy shown to eiist by the
foregoing sufficiently concerns the prerogatives
of the State and affects the liberties of the
people to be within the original Jurisdiction
of this court. ' . ' .
2. Such controversy iÂ» at Â«0 grave a char
acter and of such public importance as to
warrant this court in exerclsin* Its original
Jurisdiction to determine the right of matter,
so far as the door Ife open for It to do.
3. SincÂ« the question presented merely In
volves the duty of the Secretary of State for
the performance of an act especially enjoined
by law. It b a Judicial one.
4. For the present case, the time not having
arrived when the Secretary of State is required
to make certification of nominations, by the
general rule there in no remedy at law by
mandamus, hence action, if maintainable at
all. is properly brought in equity, if the Legis
lature has not furnished another and exclu
sive remedy.

THE Â¥ALUE OP CHARCOAL.
Few People Knew How Useful It Is in Pre-
serving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier In nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
Ing purpose.
Charrtal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and Impurities always present
in the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
rmoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently cafe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious gases whfch
collect in the stomach and bowels; It
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money is
In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
"Willow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz-
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
toon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it, is that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use, but, on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels. aiTd to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the dally use of them;
they cost but twenty-live cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal in. Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than In any." of the
ordinary charcoal tablets." Â¦ *' ' .

BLOOD WILL TELL*
It takes lots of vitality, uerrooa force and
strength to win a race Blood most be
pare and good.
Without good red Mood a man has a
weak heart and poor nerves. Thinness of
the blood, or anemia, is common in men
and young women, and all those who work
indoors, who do aot get enough good ox-
ygen in their lungs, consequently have too
many white blood corpuscles.
Keep the nerves nourished, the heart
strong, the head cool, the stomach vigorous,
the liver active with a tonic which baa
stood the test of time and has a wide repu-
tation, such as Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery.
Tonics consisting of large portlona of
alcohol, iron or cod liver oil, do not bring
the desired changes in the blood, because
they do not enter the system and are not
absorbed into the blood, with the excep-
tion of the alcohol, which aorif els op tfiÂ«
red blood corpuscles when it does come ia
contact with them. Therefore do not allow
the dealer to insult your intelligence by
telling you he has something better thaa

The following was received by tho
House of Bishops from the English con
gress:
"The Liverpool Church Congress
sends brotherly greetings to the Epis
copal church of America."
The convention is regarded as the
most important ever held by the Epis
copal denomination. The proposed leg
islation embraces questions of moral re
form, alterations In the ecclesiastical
administration and even a change In
the name of the church itself. The
House of Bishops and the House of
Dtputies, the legislative bodies, will de
vote three weeks to the consideration' of
business, and on several topics, such
as the movement to prevent the remar
rying by the clergy of a divorced per
son while the former partner is liv
ing, and the demand from certain
quarters to omit the word "Protestant"
from the church's legal title, "The
Protestant Episcopal Church of the
United States," a protracted discussion
is anticipated.

Bishop Doane welcomed the Arch
bishop of Canterbury and then devoted
a large part of his sermon to the divi
sions of Christendom. He discussed the
barriers which separate the Anglican
church from other denominations and
how they might to some extent be
broken down. While the recognition of
papal supremacy was impossible, the
Archbishop thought th.at the church
might readily recognize the primacy of
the Bishop of Home because of the an
tiquity of the Roman See. He urged a
broadening of the church's sphere.
At the opening session of the House
of Deputies Dr. Randolph H. McKim of
Washington, D. C, was selected chair
man over Rev. Charles L. Hutchins of
Concord, the candidate of most of the

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 5.â The concluding
session of the International Congress
on Tuberculosis was held to-day and
was devoted largely to the discussion
of sanitariums suitable for the treat
ment of patients afflicted with con
sumption and methods to prevent in
fection. The discussion embraced the
medical and surgical aspects of tuber
culosis, beneficial climatic conditions,
and the effect of light and electricity
on patients in the course of treatment.
That phthisis of the Iung3 cannot be
cured was the statement made to-day
by Dr. Fred Kobenheir of St. Louis,
who explained the discoveries of Pro
fessor Otto von Shroen of the Royal
University of Naples. Professor von
Shroen was unable to be present and
cent his paper to be read. Professor
von Shroen explained that a patient
suffering from consumption could live
for years In apparent health, but un

of the disease would become active and
destroy the lung tissue- In cases of
phthisis of the lungs, the professor
said, he had discovered a new germ.
which, together with the germ that had
hitherto been known to doctors to de
sfroy all animal life, existed only in the
cases of phthisis of the lungs. The fol

"Resolved, That a committee of four
be appointed who shall constitute a
committee on* publicity and who shall
be empowered to enlarge their number
by enlisting a numbe> of prominent
philanthropists, physicians and others
who may be able to assist in carrying
on a strong educational campaign
against tuberculosis."
Dr. J. H. Kellogg of Battle Creek,

WASHINGTON, Oct. 5.â For about
half a century It has been the practice
of the War Department to have sol
diers 1 clothing made at the Schuylklll
arsenal, Philadelphia, by the widows
and orphan children of soldiers. Re
cently the department decided to have
the work done by contract, purely as a
business proposition. To-day a dele
gation called on the President, who after
hearing the facts directed that the idea
of having the work done by contract be
abandoned and that it be given to the
women, as has been the practice in the
past.
At the conclusion of the hearing J. R.
Craig % a member of the delegation rep
resenting the Grand Army of the Re
public, pinned to the lapel of the Presi
dent's coat a handsome G. A". R. badge
which he had been delegated by Meade
Post of Philadelphia to present him as
an insignia as an honorary member of
that post. The President expressed his
pleasure at receiving the badge and at
the compliment paid him by Meade
Post.

LONDON. Oct. 6.â Extraordinary
Ectnts were witnessed at Liverpool In
connection with the annual Church of
England Congress now proceeding
there. The Lord Mayor held a recep
tion at the Town Hall, which was at
tended by all the leading bishops and
clergy of the United Kingdom. Then
the procession formed and marched to
the cathedral. Large crowds gathered
in the streets, to whom several leading
churchmen, including followers of the
late John Kensit's son and the Wy
clifte preachers, an organization found
ed by the late Mr. Kenslt, had previ
ously distributed anti-ritualistic pamph
lets.
As the procession, headed by the
civic regalia and the corporation, fol
lowed by the bishops and clergy, in
their robes and on foot, neared the
cathedral the demonstrators com
menced to shout "Down with Popery."
"Oh, for another Luther."
"When the venerable Archbishop of
Tork appeared, his silver cross of office
held up before him. the crowd shrieked
"Traitors," "It is Popery In the
streets," "Send them all to Rome."
Amidst a storm of hissing and shout-
Ing, the archbishop passed Into the
cathedral unmoved by the uproar.
A strong force of police was stationed
about the building, the authorities fear-
Ing more serious trouble.

Tills Is a very good picture of Mrs.
Mary Rivest. -Â»rbo lives at 522 Forty-
fourth street. Oakland. Mrs. Rivest suf-
fered jaany years with rheumatism. Fi-
nal] r the left kaee became stiffened,
swollen and painful, and at last tho left
l*g became paralyzed. The home physi-
cian feared gangrene at the knee and ad-
vised axapntation of the leg. Mrs. Ri-
vest objected to amputation and on" ad-
vice from a friend she had her relatives
take her to the Klectro-Chemic Institute,
118 Grant avenue. San Francisco. The
Klectro-Chemic treatment cured Mrs.
Kivest quickly. TherÂ« was no cutting.
There xths no pain. In a short time she j
threw away her crutches. Her left leg
is row as good as the other and Electro-
chemistry did the work when all other
treatments had failed. Should any one i
.interested doubt the whole truth of this
most -wonderful cure they should so and
see t_he happy, cured patient. She would
be only too glad to vouch for its truth.
The Electro-Chemic cures of Cancer, Tu-
mors, Consumption. Catarrh. Asthma,
Bronchitis. Deafness. Ringing Ears.
Rheumatism. Paralysis. Locomotor
Ataxla, Neuralgia. Dyspepsia. Liver
Trouble. Kidney and Bladder Troubles.
Piles. Fistula. Constipation. Headache,
Dizziness. Insomnia. Epilepsy. Stricture,
Prostatitis, Blood Poison, Female Irreg-
ularities and Misplacements, etc.. etc^
are just as wonderful as the cure of Mrs.
Rivest. and upon application the testi-
monials of hundreds of cured patients
living right here la San Francisco will
be cheerful 'y given. These wonderful
<rures are quick, permanent and inexpen-
sive, and. no matter how many other
treatments have failed. Klectro-Chemls-
try tro'jld in all probability prove cura r
tivÂ«\ The Electro-Chemic X-Ray exami-
nation is the most reliable examination
that any sufferer can have. Such an ex-
amination will <juickly show whether a
<-a.j?e is curable or not. and this examina-
tion Is now absolutely free to any suf-
ferer applying at the Institute for it.
Dor.'t mistake tKe place. The success
of the Electro-Chemic practice has
caused ot?:cr physicians to try to imitate
it. The Electro-Chemic Institute .occupies
nearly the wliol- first l!oor of the large
building, 13 8 Grant avenue, corner of
Post street. The offlce hours are from 9
to 5 end 7 to S daily and from 19 to 1 on
Sundaj-s. Consultation, examination and
advice arc free to all. and patients living
at a distance arc furnished a home treat-
ment that is most successful and are
loaned, free of charge until cured, a
complete Electro-Chemic apparatus.
From a wide experience, the physicians
of the Elect ro-Chemic Institute have
learned that the very best advertising
comes from patients who have been
quickJy. thoroughly and cheaply cured.
and while Mrs. Rivest only paid a few
dollars for her wonderful cure, she has
been the means of sending many other
to the Institute for treatment.

NILE REVELERS.
By Zoc Green Radcliffe.
OAKLAND, Oct. ! 5. â Although there are
three line men's clubs in town there hatf hith
erto been very, little doing socially in any
of them.' But at last - the Nile Club has
yawned and stretched in Its cozy little quar
ters, and the merry- kick It gave last night
would seem to Indicate a lively awakening.
The club started out in the right way a lew
weeks ago by -gathering its orchestral talent
together, under the . direction and leadership
of W. J. McCoy. The newly fledged orchestra
made its initial api>earance at the "revels'
last night, and its pronounced success speaks
well, not only {or the musicians themselves
but for their painstaking leader. Ever since
the Bohemian Club furnished an avenue to
lame for the splendid genluo of Mr. McCoy we
are all very proud to claim him for Oakland,
and the Nile Club is anxious to create another
opportunity for the talent that has too long
lam dormant, t-'o before another year we may
read of a Nile Club revels that will rival the
most artistic Bohemian :"Jinks.' . -
Members of the Nile Club are just waking
up to the fact that they have talent, and
plenty of it, right in their own ranks. Judge
Melvln, Charlie Heeseman, Pete Sloan and
Dave Mclaughlin are old stand-bys of . the
club, always to be depended on for a good,
story or clever stunt, .Then there is John A.
Britton and' Dr. Maher, who are noted for
bright and witty papers; Dick Ayres, who has
a talent for verse tliat he I frequently -turns
to. good account; George Walker and Kendall
Fellows, . a whole show- in - themselves, are
members of the club, anil so are D. W. .Tames
and Thomas Kickard. ; This is only a. passing
glance at: the club's array of talent,, but It
promises much for the '. "revels" that are even
now being planned â which does not, however,
mean the revels that will take place on the
J22d of October.
But to return to our mutton â the revels of
last night. Georg* Walker was dictator, and
besides several very fine selections by the or
chettra, which was "on tap," &s it were, all
during the evening, there was an Informal pro
gramme. One of the funniest things was the
letter purporting to come from Clarence Cro
well, the newest Benedict in the club, now
away on his honeymoon trip. It was read by
George Jackson and ' rumor hath it that Judge
Melvln knows the real writer thereof.
George Macdougal told some good stories in
Scotch dialect, and Dave McLaughlln was
called upon for stories, George Walker. Ken
dall Fellows and Ben Southard were also
among the funmakers.
The orchestra, which added greatly to the
success of the revels, is made up as follows:
Viollnaâ H. Seekamp, Dr. Frank Hus. Dr. J.
M. Stadler:" viola. Eugene Colby; cello, Harry
Danforth; bass-. Df. Charles A. Dukes; cbr
nets-^E. F. Webb, E. B. Jordan; trombone,- J.
Laughland: clarinet, N. E. Braun; oboe, F. M.
Seymour; flute. Dr. H. M. Fine; drums â Li. W. 1
Barrett; director, W. J. McCoy.
The Fore-Hewlett wedding is to be a church
affair,' and several hundred Invitations havo
been sent out. St. Paul's, which has been fa
vored. of so many lovely brides, will also be
the scene of this marriage, and no lovelier
maid has ever approached th<5 nuptial altar
there than beautiful lone Fore. Her eister
Pauline will be maid of honor and six pretty
bridesmaids will be in attendance â Miss Nata
lia. For*". Miss CrlBBie Taft, Miss Gertrude Al
len, Miss EthM Valentine, Miss Grace Baldwin
and Miss E-Jlth Gasklll. -
The' wedding tak?s place- on' the 20th, and in
the meantime a number of charming affairs are
being, .plannod In honor . of the young bride
elect, notably a "doyly shower" that Miss
Mamie Edith Pope'is giving on. Friday after

a smart affair, will be given October 19, the
presiding hostesses to be Mrs. W. S. Palmer
and Mrs. W. A. Schrock.
Mrs. Will Culligan. better known perhaps as
Jeannette Duncan, la exhibiting at Rabjohn's

mospheric effects good. Â«p that altogether Mrs.
Culligan has done Â»me excellent 1 work. Mrs.
Culligan is a former pupil of the College of

turned out many Â¦ women now known in the
world of art and letters.

"I did not swear," he said, "that
jny wife was concerned in any plot
that might have resulted in the assas
sination of the President, nor did I
swear that one Holmes, an alleeed an
archist, was one of her guests. I say
this in justice to her.".
Hoag left a wife and the pastorate pf
a church to go with Mrs.
Benedict. He has since returned to
Oakland, but not with the woman.
They separated a few weeks after leav
ing Oakland. Hoag's ohurch is disor
ganized and the church property is to
be sold. His wife permitted him to re
turn to her. He is now practicing law
in this city.
Mr. Benedict to-night expressed the
hope that whoever was responsible for
revealing the testimony given by him
before the Court Commissioner would
be called to account.
Mr. Benedict, now a commercial
eeent in receipt of a large salary and
provided with plenty of the world's
goods, was for four years of his life a
Pinkerton detective.
Notably Mr. Benedict accuses his wife
cf entertaining one Holmes, an An
archist agitator, while President Roose
velt was in the city a year ago. Other
persons of similar tendencies are sup
posed to have found in the Benedict
home at that time a comfortable ren
dezvous.
Instead, however, of accusing Mrs.
Benedict of association with Rev. Mr.
Hoag. the husband in his testimony
taken by the court commissioner
charges as cause for divorce that she
has made his home on Thirty-fourth
street a rendezvous for Anarchists and
Socialists during his absence from the
city. She is accused of harboring char
acters whose principles and practices
would make thtm subjects for Govern
ment eeoret service surveillance.
OAKLAND. Oct. 5.â Sensational
charges are made by Nelson W. Bene
dict against his wife, Hinda Clevenger
Benedict, from whom he seeks divorce,
in testimony filed with Judge Ellsworth
to-day by the Court Commissioner.
Mrs. Benedict left this city several
months ago simultaneously with Rev.
C. W. Hoag, pastor of the Plymouth
avenue Congregational Church, and
Benedict followed the couple through
the Southwest, finding trace* of their
movements at Dallas, Tex., and other
cities.
FRESNO, Oct. 5.â The residents of
this city were amazed and many of
them terrified by the strange electrical
display in the heavens here to-night-
From a pleasant afternoon it took
but twenty minutes at about 6 o'clock
to drape the sky with-' heavy rain
clouds and change the fading 1 sunshine
into the blackness of night.
Distant rumbles and flashes of light
ning preceded a downpour of rain such
as was never seen in this country. Old
timers say they never saw anything
like it. The cloudburst lasted for
nearly an hour, during which time in
termittent flashes of lightning made in
tervals bright as day.
The thunderbolts continued volleying
till late this evening. The streets are
running with water, the precipitation
of the hour's downpour being more
than a quarter of an inch. It was most
ly a local storm and tne raisin grow
ers were given warning by Weather
Observer Bolton.' Little damage was
dene to the crops.

Chapin decided that he could not use
the College avenue franchise, so he pe
titioned the Council for the return, of
his money after he had transferred the
Fourth avenue franchise. Councilman
John-L.. Howard, chairman of the Fin
ance Committee, objected. He declared
that he could not understand why
Chapin should go before the City. Coun
cil and claim that the franchises were
illegal after he had sold one of them
to the Transit^ corporation. The petition
was rejected.
In his complaint Chapin sets up the
: same plea tjiat he did before the City
Council, , namely, that the proceedings
under which the franchises were grant
ed were irregular. Chapin alleges that
the call for bids failed to declare that
the successful bidder should agree to
pay five years after the railroad began
operations an annual per centum of
gross receipts. . This alleged omission
from the preliminary notice, Chapin
avers, invalidates the franchise.
F. E. Chapin brought suit to-day in
the Superior Court to recover $8500
from the city of Oakland, money paid
for street railroad franchises bought by
J. H. Macdonald last March, but since
assigned to Chapin, who Is a street rail
way promoter of San Jose.
Macdonald appeared unexpectedly be
fore the City Council as a bidder
against the Oakland Transit Consoli
dated for the franchises, which includ
ed rights on College avenue and on sev
eral streets forming the Fourth ave
nue cut-off in East Oakland. There was
a spirited contest, the franchises finally
being awarded to Macdonald. Subse
quently the assignment was made.
Chapin scld the Fourth avenue fran
chise to the Transit people. They com
pleted the road and are operating it to-
day. The City Council has ratified that
assignment.

8pÂ«cl*l I Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
Albert M*. Johnson closed the argu
ment. He dealt with the law points
and argued upon the Judicial discre
tion of the court in matters of contin
uance. He said that the strenuous re
sistance of the Â¦;< motion by- the other
side was an evidence of its extreme im
portance. The , attorney discussed the
evidence to "be produced from the for
eign witnesses, ' particularly that of
Coroner Scholer of New York,: alleged
to be-in effect that Miss Warren said
Miss Dolbeer â¢ had been mentally . de
ranged for years. , Â¦;- ,-'..-Â¦_
Mr. McEnerney's argument was brief.
He. made the point that: the affidavit
was not made by the person in pos
session of the factsâ It should have
been made by the attorneys. The lega
tees, he said, were entitled to have the
validity of the will determined and
having already had two months' time
the contestants could not claim that
the case was being "railroaded
through." The evidence expected from
the Deutschland witnesses was sub
ject to proof by witnesses In this city,
and besides, the ship had been in port
several times since June 30, when Mias
Dolbeer came. oven and the depositions
could have been taken. Â¦
He said that the two witnesses to
the will were in court ready to testify-
Miss Dolbeer wrote the will herself and
put it in a safe deposit box and took
the extra precaution to make a copy
in her own- hand and place it in the
safe of the Dolbeer-Carson Lum
ber Company. By the deposition
of Miss . Warren it was shown,
he said, that three San Fran
ciscans came across the ' ocean on
the Deutschland with Miss Dolbeerâ
James Tyson and his two brothersâ
and they would testify. As to the Paris
witnesses, he thought the . Misses
O'Connor and King were likely to re
turn to San Francisco; the State law
would seal the lips of Dr. Gros. .
As to the delay in settling the es
tate he thought the executors and lega
tees, including various charities, had
some rights which should be consid
ered. â¢ f -
Mr. Pillsbury answered Johnson, re
citing the progress of the case and say
ing that the issues had been joined for
more than two months and in setting
the trial for October 4 the court had
given more time than was at first in
tended. When the Contest was filed,
August 2, Miss Dolbeer's mental un
soundness was alleged, but Schander
on the stand hadTdeClared that he knew
nothing about her' mental condition at
the time of making the will and he had
admitted under oath that Miss War
ren's deposition was taken for the pur
pose of finding something on which to
base a case. "He was simply taking
chances to find something to support
this contest," said the attorney. "This
business of contesting wills has grown
into an Industry in this city; it is the
business of certain attorneys to look
up heirs who might bring a contest in
order to be bought off. It Is now al
most an exception when a contest is
not presented or overtures made for
an adjustment with persons who might
contest a will."
Mr. Pillsbury said that the mental
soundness or unsoundness of Miss Dol
beer on April 27. when she made the
will, was the only material issue 'and
that could be determined by witnesses
in California. In William G. Mugan's
deposition It was stated that when
Miss Dolbeer left on her trip to Europe
at least twenty of her associates ac
companied her to Oakland to see her
off, well-known persons by any one
of whom her mental condition could be
proved, and there were probably, he
said, fifty others of highest respectabil
ity who could be procured to testify
within twenty-four hours.
v *" WROTE WILL HERSELF.
t Hiram Johnson opened the argument
In support of the motion for continu
ance, saying that the contestant had
not had sufficient time to prepare his
case. He spoke of the necessity for the
testimony of the absent witnesses. He
discussed the materiality of the evi
dence and the diligence with which the
investigations had been conducted. Of
the delays already occasioned, he said
the effort to get Miss Warren's deposi
tion alone used up at least twenty-one
days.
PLLLSBURY'S REJOINDER.
Figuring carefully upon the dates.
Judge Coffey was of the opinion that
the depositions could be brought here
in time for a trial on November 2, and
he named that date for the commence
ment of the hearing. "This setting is
peremptory," he .said, "and I will have
a jury here on that day." The court de
cided that the depositions desired in
Paris were unnecessaryâ that the
Misses King and O'Connor would prob
ably not be there, and It might be held
that the testimony of the French phy
sician, Dr. Gros, would not be admit
ted as evidence under * the California
law against the use of the confidential
relations between doctor and patient.
At the opening of yesterday's hear
ing Mr. Pillsbury -recalled Schander to
the stand, but the lawyer's efforts to
draw from the witness the details o'f
his conferences with his brother Hora
tio regarding who should begin the con
test were made unavailing by Schand
er's lack of memory. He was asked aa
to the Information gathered in New
York by his representative, but he was
unable to give any facts. He had been
told that the representative, who was
employed by the Johnsons, was Charles
J. Stillwell, a private detective.
At the conclusion of. three hours of
spirited argument, participated 1 In by
Attorneys Pillsbury, MdEnerney and
the two Johnsons, Judge Coffey decided
yesterday that Adolph Schander was
entitled to a continuance of the trial
of his contest against the will of Ber
tha M. Dolbeer. The court, however,
was opposed to a long delay i and de
clared that only time enough would be
granted in which to obtain the deposi
tions in New York and at the Connec
ticut and Massachusetts insane asy
lums which are said to be necessary
for the contestant's case.

In this connection a local paper

absolve themselves from culpability in
the disappearance of the two attaches.

General Stoessel's report created
great rejoicing and revived the hope in
his ability to defend the fortress. After
the failure of the storming operations
the War Office here would not b.e sur
prised if the Japanese changed' their
plans to a regular engineering siege.
No fresh news has been received from
Mukden. According to the War Office's
information quiet continues there.

Petersburg In ten days to rejoin the

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct.' B. 6:20 p.m.
Emperor Nicholas has at last received
General Stoessel's official report of the
desperate four days* assault of the be
siegers upon Port Arthur from Sep
tember 19 to September 23, from -which
It appears that the unofficial report
from Chefu was by no means exagger
ated. The Japanese displayed frenzied
bravery. They lost ten thousand men,
and their only success was the capture
of two redoubts guarding: the water
works. They prepared for the assault
by a general bombardment and then
launched their attacks simultaneously
from the north and west. Night and
day they fo-ight under a cover of a
continual bombardment from' their
siege guns, and finally reached the re
doubts on the north side, but only
after the defenses there ' were- com
pletely demolished by shell fire from
the west.
The Japanese efforts were directed
chiefly against the commanding posi
tion on High Mountain, which faces
Pigeon Bay. If. it had fallen Its pos
session would have given the Japanese
a tremendous lever against the chain
of inner defenses. The carnage there
was terrible and culminated Septem
ber 22, when the Japanese succeeded in
reaching and occupying the Russian ar
mored shelter trenclres, whence they
expected undoubtedly to storm the
summit. During the night Lieutenant
Poggorsky of the navy, at the, head of
a detachment of volunteers, descended
upon the trenches and blew them up
with pyroxylin bombs, producing a
panic among the besiegers, who fled,
leaving the mountain Bide strewn with
dead. The Japanese then abandoned
further attempts, but after a day or
two to recuperate, according to Gen
eral Stoessel's second dispatch, dated
September 30, they resumed the bom
bardment of the city and outer works,
and began to construct zigzag ap
proaches, evidently hoping to get
a nearer position from which to launch
their next assault.
The loss of the water works is not
considered vital as there Is a fresh
water lake and numerous wells as well
as a condensing apparatus within the
defenses.
General Stoessel recommends General
Kondratenko, Lieutenant Poggorsky,
Colonel Irman of the artillex-y. and
Captain Sychaff of the Fifth Siberian
regiment for the St. George's Cross.
The complete character of the repulse
of the Japanese has evidently greatly
Inspired the garrison of Port Arthur.
General Stoessel says the gallantry of
the Russian troops was beyond promise
and adds that the garrison will hold
out to the last drop of blood.
General Stoessel adds that practical
ly nothing remained of the water works
redoubts when the surviving Russians
evacuated them.
General Stoessel's dispatch, which
was dated September 30, concludes:
"After bloody assaults from the 19th
to the 23d of September, there has been
comparative tranquillity around the
fortress. On the night of September
23d the Japanese after being repulsed
by Lieutenant Poggorsky, fled in panic.
They are now working very actively
and are approaching by a tunnel and
entrenchments. The bombardment
was maintained both upon the forts
and the buildings within the fortress.
In the absence of developments at
tlie front Interest at St. Petersburg
centers in the disposition to be made
of certain Important civil and mili
tary officers. Rumor has it that Vice
roy Alexlcff has been reinstated in
royal favor and will, upon his return
from the Fsr East, become the ac
tual director of Russia's foreign pol
icy. Friends of General Kcropatkin
are confident that he will be given at
least temporary command of the two
great Russian armies. No nevrs later
than September 30 has been received
from Port Arthur. At the date given
tlie garrison had been inspired by re
pulses of the .Japanese

"The sight of the cars being speeded
along the edge of the ocean would be
an attraction to the thousands who
visit this grand beach. The speedway
would also have a tendency to do away
with fast driving on tne park roads.
If the automobllists will co-operate
with the Commissioners in this matter
we will soon provide them with a
stretch of road of which they will be
proud. In this city of hills it seems
the only place available.
"The Park Commissioners have so
many outside demands upon the funds
intrusted to them for disbursal that
they could not undertake the work
without some assistance from the au
tcmobllists- If the latter will raise
$6000 the board will undertake to com
plete the work. There is a large quan
tity of sand to be removed. After this
work is done a speedway would have
tu be constructed on scientific prin
ciples. There would have to be a firm
foundation and then a smooth surface
over which the cars could be run at a
high rate of speed.
The Park Commissioners, in pursu
ance of their plan to provide facilities
within the public playground for the
enjoyment of as many different sporta
and pastimes as possible, are continu
ally outlining new features.
Reuben H. Lloyd, one of the Com
missioners, who has at all times en
tered heartily into the performance of
his duties, has been tireless in this re
spect. He has been studying the needs
of the automobilist for some time and
is in a position now. to point out where
a speedway can be built for them.
In discussing the proposed improve
ment yesterday Mr. Lloyd said: "The
automobile has come to stay and we
should keep up with the times and pro
vide the owners with all facilities for
the enjoyment of the pastime. I have
just signed permit No. 712, which indi
cates that that number of machines
may be driven through the park. Of
ccurse there are machines used exclu
sively downtown, so this number does
not show all owned here.
"There has been a lack of a place
to speed these machines within the law.
and I see a way to make up for this
deficiency. My Idea, is to make the
Ocean boulevard 200 feet wide for its*
entire length of two miles. One half
this could be given over to the auto
mobiles. This strip could then be di
vided into an up and a down course,
so there would be no danger of colli
sions.

"BUSIIER" LED TO SLAUGHTER.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 5.
In a slow, hard fought game, where
fumbling, penalizing and punting oc
curred far too frequently to make the
contest interesting to the spectators,
the Stanford freshman eleven and the
Belmont School team played a tie
game this afternoon at Belmont. Each
side made one touchdown and kicked
the goal, the final score standing 6
to 6.
The Cardinal baby team got into the
play at the start, and pushed the .ball
ever the goal line in ten minutes of
scrimmage. This early success could
not be followed up and only once after
that was the . freshman team danger
ously riear the goal line.
The "prep" eleven from Belmont
outplayed the freshmen both on offen
sive and defensive work after Stan
ford's touchdown and quickly suc
ceeded in forcing Halfback Miller
through the line and between the goal
posts. Twice they nearly scored again,
after they had made ground on an ex
change of punts, but the freshmen line
held firm and took the ball. r
With, the intercollegiate game with
the "* California youngsters only ten
days off, the Cardinal coaches will
have to use, strenuous means to round
the Stanford team into winning form.
Neither Horton nor ; TomasIni,-the two
big tackles who are being tried out on
the varsity eleven, were : in to-day's
game.'and their Â¦ presence in the. final
freshman lineup. will add both strength
and confidence to, the team.'. -

The Lick and Polytechnic High School
football elevens will clash for the cham
pionship of the San Francisco sub
league of the / Academic Athletic
League. This is the result of a meeting
last evening at the Olympic Club of
Bert Chaplin, James G. Boobar and R.
L. Mlkel, the football committee of the
Academic Athletic League. The protest
entered by Lick against the "Poly"
eleven was thoroughly debated by both
sides and then final decision given by
the committee. The decision will natur
ally cause much dissatisfaction, espe
cially among the Lick enthusiasts. It
is probably as fair a one as the com
mittee could have given. The following
official letter will be mailed to-day to
the two schools:
A protest having been made by the Califor
nia School of Mechanical Arts against Poly
technic High School in respect to the football
game on Friday. September 24, 1904, on the
ground that the Polytechnic High School
players were not entitled to play, because they
had not been registered two weeks before the
came, as stated in the constitution of the
league, article 0. the committee finds and
orders as follows:- That the Polytechnic
Hlfch School and its delegate players clearly
violated the constitution of the league in the
respect mentioned; that Polytechnic High
School, being in fault, shall pay to the chair
man of the football committee of the leaeue.
for the league, the sum of $25 forty-eight
hours prior to the playing of the game herein
after mentioned: that the tie game of Sep
tember 24 between- the two schools shall be
played oft on or before Saturday, October 15.
provided the managers of the two teams cannot
asree on the same date prior to October 15,
and provided Polytechnic High School shall
have paid fine, as heretofore mentioned.

Jackson was liberal enough to walk
Hildebrand, who promptly stole and
v/eut to sack three on Byrnes' bad peg
to Sthlalley. Meany came through
with a KÂ°od one, as did Andy Ander

JSchiatley bingled and came tearing
round the sacks on Bill Devereaux's

they got !t in the fiftn. Whaien bit
off one through the infle'.d. Van Buren
shoved him up on a sac-rrflce and Wal

work with a drive to center.
The ''ommuters had another good

Dur.Ieavy and Schlafley each stung
safely and Kruger flew to first. Van

Gochnauer dropped the ball and Dun

than they began to win, in accordance
with precedents often noted hitherto.
A few days ago King Cole won a race

purchased him. L.eonidas, purchased at
the same sale by "Jeff" Yeager, won
the Bronx highweight handicap to-day
fronra good field, including the odds-on
favorite. Lady Amelia, which ran un
placed.
It was not without a good struggle,
however, that Lady Amelia surren
dered her lead, the light-weighted Cas

mission. For a sÂ»hort distance he ap
peared a likely winner, only to yield in
the last few strides to the superbly
ridden Leonidas, on which Hlldebrand
had the mount.
While Lady Amelia and Castalian
were traveling out in front at a terrific
pace Leonidas was no better than fifth.

I had Nasal Catarrh for years for which I
Â¦used S. S. S. with very gratifying results.
I tried local applications for some time,
and getting no permanent relief I came to
the conclusion that the seat of the trouble
was in the blood. Knowing S. S. S. to be
a good blood medicine I began its nse,
and after using it for some little while it
did away entirely with the offensive mu-

hawk and spit, especially in the morning,
to dislodge the catarrhal matter. .

ence was carried on with the traffic
officials of the northern railway lines
and this resulted in the issuance of a
tariff which re-established the differ
entials between carload and less than
carload rates, which are practically
the same as those that are and have
been in effect, to California terminals.
If the low defferentials had remained
operative on the northern roads the
California roads might have been
compelled to adopt the same low dif
ferentials and bo have opened up the
entire Pacific Coast to the Eastern
jobbers and manufacturers.
The association strongly opposed
the parcels post service bill, publish
ing and circulating 10,000 copies of a
pamphlet regarding that matter, the
opposition being based on the fact
that the parcels poet service would di
vert to the large department stores in
Eastern cities hundreds of thousands
of dollars that are now annually ex
pended in purchases made from lo
cal merchants doing business on the
Pacific Coast- The Congressmen and
I'nited States Senators from the Pa
cific Coast were also addressed by the
association on this' subject.
Mr. Love land urged upon the mem
bers to continue to support the asso
ciation because its existence is a pro
tection to the business men of the Pa
cific Coast and adds hundreds of thou
sands of dollars to the business trans
acted by Pacific Coast merchants
every vear.
The Pacific Mail steamer Newport
arrived yesterday, twenty-one days
from Panama and way ports. She
brought fourteen cabin passengers and
twenty-five people in the steerage; 831
tons of cargo and $57,763 In treasure-
One of the passengers was Sir James
Talbot Powers, baronet, who is trav
eling around the world.
Soon after leaving Acapulco. Mexico,
the Newport encountered one of the
coast gales like that which sent the
Colima and other pood ships to destruc
tion. For almost three days and nights
the seas piled over the vessel, flooding
not only the lower, but the upper decks.
The steamer rolled like a cask and no
passenger ventured out of his state
room during the duration of the tem
pest, nor was the bridge, the highest
point in the vessel's structure, free
frcm the stormy waves. Much of the
time during the gale the captain was
lashed in his lookout to prevent his
being washed overboard. Several per
sons were slightly injured by being
hurled against a bulkhead.
The cabin passengers were as fol
lows:
Sir Jam** Talbot Powers. George A. MtHer,
John G. Marino. B. Speed. A. Marchlsni. Dr.
Juan Garcia, R. Haas Newton Wolf, Gerard
E. 'Ward. W. S. Beard. R. A. Leals, W. C.
Parshbaker. Miss Alejandra Douglas.

In France you cannot help being
struck with the smartness and great
simplicity of the tailor made gowns,
fitting into the figure and the waist,
especially those with long basque; the
three-quarter basque has come to stay,
says the Queen-. The basque rounding
tc the curve of the waist and marking
the hips" falls into every movement of
the wearer lind the straight line In
front is not exaggerated. Sometimes
there. is a seam at the waist, but more
often not, but in many the basque and
the coat are cut in one. In Paris per
fect neatness is essential, but while
thfe tailor made is simple the checked
silks, eollennes and the thin cashmeres
are all picture gowns with more or
less elaboration of detail.

IN the comprehensive "Review of the World's Commerce!'' recently
issued by the Department of Commerce and Labor,- mention is
made of a unique method of national advertising in vogue among
the largest of the European industrial nations â that of the floating
exposition. According to the methods of this novel plan of exploita
tion a large boat, chartered by a chamber of commerce or the mer
chants of any great manufacturing community, is fitted out with
every facility for the display of products and sent upon a cruise to
the most likely markets among European seaports. The entire ex
pense of the expedition is met by the rents paid for apportionments
of space by individual exhibitors, and the profits accrue from the
expanded markets secured by thus bringing samples to the very
doors of the consumers.
To Americans who have always prided themselves upon their
advertising ability and the ingenuity of their bids for trade this
idea of the floating museum of industrial products should have a
livening appeal. At the present time there are few manufacturing
houses that have more than trusted agents abroad, and these men,
keen for business though they may be, cannot do the work of ex^
ploitation that should be done. Here is a device by which whole
communities may advance their communal interests as well as serve
private profit. To cry our wares on the world's highway on a
scale such as that represented by the floating exhibition would be
to make a strong try at markets now beyond our reach.
For us here on the Pacific Coast, to whom the trade of the
Orient is a great factor in future success, this idea of- the European
traffickers seems to have practicability. Suppose that one of our
trade or manufacturing boards or a producers' association of the
interior should fit out a steamer with a display of what we raise
and what we make here in California and should send it to Chinese
and Japanese ports. Surely this visible manifestation of trade re
sources would touch a responsive chord in the heart of the slant-eyed
merchant across the seas. ;

Nearly. seventy years ago John Wes

dians wh%n a small child while playing
with his brothers and sisters upon the
site of the present Boston and Maine

captive and supposed by his family to
have been drowned a half-brother was
born who was also named John W. It
was a strange coincidence that the lat

It is to be hoped that all women
adopting round skirts will see to it
that they are not only long, but a
shade longer in the front than in the
back. If a skirt is not cut properly
there is a tendency for it to run up
in front, and this tendency should be
discovered and remedied, for nothing
Is more fatal to one's appearance
than to have a skirt tilting, up at the
front. Even a properly cut skirt, if
it is tight, may have the "hang"
ruined if the wearer is not careful how
she sits and stands in It.
The new skirts are to be fuller, but
It is hardly likely that in the heavy
winter cloths thl3 fullness will be at
tained in walking gowns, as it would
make them too cumbersome. Â¦ , i:
The coats fitted at the back and over
the hips, but' swinging a little loose
in front to show vests of contrasting
colors, are a feature of the new walk
ing costumes, but the devotee of the
Eton coat need not be discouraged. Al
though many attempts have been made
to dethrone the Eton Jacket it is still
here and will probably be worn for
some time. They are well suited to
requirements of- many women and on
that account will be fashionable this
winter.
For stout women and also for short
women skirts that Just clear the
pavement are most becoming. Such
skirts are more or less of a nuisance,
for they are just long enough to dip
into every puddle or other filth of
the street, and yet too short to hold
up, a particularly ungraceful effect
being given by the lifting of skirts
that manifestly clear the ground.
It is indeed welcome news to the
sensible woman that the short skirts
are here to stay, and even those who
are least practical will have to capitu
late. The instep length skirts are not
only to be worn for walking, but for
reception gowns, and those who look
best in skirts of that length will wear
them for the latter purpose. In the
longer skirts those that barely touch
in the front and at the sides and drag
on the floor at the back will be fash
ionable for dinner gowns and general
evening wear. The skirts that rest
on the floor several inches all the way
around and that are so ungraceful as
well as slovenly, are being hidden
aWay by all up-to-date women.
WINTER SKIRTS.
grancy. And in almost every instance the defendant was an itinerant
loafer who had spent the mellow season away from urban discom
forts. He was arrested for sleeping in a public square, or for beg
ging, or for petty larceny. The two youths to whom Judge Mogan
gave half a year in jail had just arrived from the interior when they
were caught in the act of heaping oral abuse upon a citizen who
declined to contribute to their maintenance in idleness. But they
.were old offenders. . -
There are philanthropists who encourage street-begging, else
there would be no street-begging. They are aware of the existence
of public institutions for the aid of the deserving poor, and they
know that any self-respecting man would prefer accepting charity
from one of those institutions to soliciting alms from strangers and
receiving the rebuffs which practical benevolence gives instead of
alms. Yet with all this knowledge they submit to being accosted bv
lusty mendicants who will not take no for an answer, and who are
confident of extracting something at last because of their impor
tunity. If they fail to awaken their victim's pity they usually en
deavor to force him to buy immunity from their whines or curses. It
is this class of citizen that is most in need of protection from the
street-beggar. The citizen of tougher fiber can protect himself.
AFTER sentencing two sturdy young vagabonds to six months'
imprisonment for soliciting alms on the street, Police Judge
Mogan announced his intention to punish with equal severity
every able-bodied mendicant convicted in his court. Adherence to
this drastic policy will, he believes, effect a diminution of crime in
San Francisco by making the city less favored as a winter resort by
the professionally idle who spend the warmer season in the rural
regions.
If all police magistrates in San Francisco were to adopt the
policy there would unquestionably be a falling off in the percentage
of undesirable residents here next winter. It is notorious that hun
dreds of tramps spend their winters in this city and live by begging
and stealing. The police records show that the number of arrests
for those offenses during the summer is at least 50 per j cent less
than the number registered between the months of October and
March, inclusive. The Police Court calendars last Monday con
tained 125 new cases, of which at least three-fourths were for va-

PROTECTION FROM STREET-BEGGARS.
Miss Ingles was trained for the
stage. She played Juvenile parts while
very small. Later she determined to
abandon the stage for politics. She
was made enrolling clerk of the Ken
tucky Senate In recognition of her
work in the 1896 campaign.
MISS MAROARET INDUES, a Yi
vacious Kentucky girl, has gone
to New York to answer a sum
mons from Thomas Taggart, chair
man of the Democratic National Com
mittee, to prepare for her stump
speaking campaign In Indiana, says
the Lexington correspondent of the
Philadelphia North American.
Miss Ingles is well known la Ken
tucky and several other States as a
campaign orator, but this year she
will undertake for the first tlmÂ» to
"whoop it up" In the Hooslar com
monwealth.
"I had hoped for ths nomination of
Mr. Bryan," she said. "but. Wcs a pol
itician, I must abide by tha decision
of the majority and will gtre Mr. Par
ker my hearty support. I would not
mention my preference for Mr. Bryan.
but, you know, I spoke for him In the
campaigns of 1896 and 1900 and I
suppose I have become a little partial
to him."
Miss Ingles spoke from the platform,
with Mr. Bryan In 1836, when that
leader waa In Lexington, and faced
the largest audience that ever greeted
a public speaker In this State.
BY confining his initial campaign tour to rural Nebraska Wil
liam Jennings Bryan displays questionable discretion. It may
be urged that just as the shrewd theatrical manager "tries out"
a new v p!ay in small towns before introducing it to the presumably
higher intelligence and sharper discrimination of the metropolis, so
is Colonel Brvan putting his new partisan doctrines to test in "the
villages between Omaha and Emerson, Nebr." preliminary to ven
tilating them in the great cities, and that by carefully noting their
effect upon the com belt ha will be able to make such eliminations
and additions as may make them entirety acceptable to the urban
masses. Conceding that such -is his motive, the fact -remains that he
showed defective .judgment -in the selection of .his field of expend
meat.
When lie resolved to "try : it on the &jg," -as the playerfolk say,
Colonel Bryan could have obtained a more enlightening if less flat
tering test by choosing an animal less prone to be influenced by
State pride or personal predilection. That is to say, his inconsis
tencies of sentiment that might be overlooked by the Democrats of
Wahoo or Weeping Water, Nebr., might not find favor with the
Democrats of Oshkosh, Wis., or Kalamazoo, Mich. While his near
neighbors may pass without disparaging comment his tacit support
of a Presidential candidate -whose monetary views are directly in
conflict with those set forth in the two national platforms o^ Colonel
Bryan's own making, the voters non-resident of the Platte region
who fought and fell with free coinage in 1896 and 1900 may take
exception to Colonel Bryan's advocacy of a candidate and a plat
form that declare unequivocally for the gold standard. Therefore,
by testing his new campaign speeches so near home Colonel Bryan
is probably wasting both wind and time and indulging self-delusion.
His pro-Parker utterances that evoke Democratic applause on the
Missouri's western shore are likely to fail of Democratic tolerance
on the eastern banks of that muddy stream. When he leaves Ne
braska behind him he may find it necessary to revise his revisions.
But wherever he goes or he says, Colonel Bryan will
not address empty benches. As in former years, when he was an
entry for the Presidential stakes, be will be listened to by folk who
are more than ever proof against conversion by his pleading â the
same folk who listened to him and then voted against him eagfat
years ago and repeated the performance four years later. They will
flock to hear him becanse of his fame as a public speaker, and they
Â¦will again enjoy his resonant voice, his easy flow of words, his
beaming smile. Whether his propositions are lncid or vagueâ JTke
a chapter from Solomon or an opinion by Captain Jack Bunsby â
they will give him the respectful hearing due the man who has
talked more and said and accomplished less than an} r other man
alive or embalmed in history.

To enjoy the 'needful and forego the

The possibilities of economizing in

which tell. f
WOMEN often forget that the test
of well-spent money depends on
the value obtained in exchange.
They scrimp and pinch, suffer and save,
and perhaps take to themselves much
credit for doing bo. To eat a poor din

But many men and women fare plain
ly that they may look spick and span
from the most respectable motives. Ex

the luxury of the rich. The millionaire
may do what the. business man dare
not. As a rule it Is bad economy not
to look Quite as prosperous as circum
stances will let you. To be healthy,
too, you must be housed dryly and air

not good and regular meals.

The table and kitchen present oppor
tunities for saving unrivaled. Not
through stintingâ that folly leads to
doctor's bills and impaired forcesâ but
through very careful selection and
preparation of the cheap and abundant
and the ingenious utilization of every
thing. Domestic service permits of
much saving. A handy wife and daugh
ters working methodically can keep a
small house in perfect order, yet each
have half the day at her own disposal.
The mistress alone, with slight help,
can get the work done and yet not be
always slaving if she rises early, or
ganizes and knows her business. One
good servant helped by the ladies of
the house can keep going an establish
ment with elegance even. But the
cheap servant is a snare. She will
break and fingermark, spoil food in tha
cooking and do other things as a set-off
against the $4 or $5 you reckon to save
on her wages.

Despite the forbidding aspect of the

Chutes yesterday* afternoon and did
their share toward swelling the Teach

children inside the big inclosure was
worth going miles to see. All the
booths, the theater, the pavilion and
other attractions were well patronized.

The meeting opened with a long
preeeh by E. P. E. Troy, the secretary
of the association, in which he made
on attack upon the street railroads.
His remarks aroused the indignation
of many, citizens present. John P.
Cleese. who emphatically denied
Troy's charge that he was a "heeler"
and a worker for the railroad, said
that the action of the- association in
censuring the railroad was a mistake.
His .statements wer.e seconded by Ed
ward Ginley and L, R. Rockwell, 'who
urged that the association submit its
jjrievances to the railroad before tak
ins any radical action.
Their suggestions were received with
unanimity by the gathering and it was
finally decided that a committee of
three be appointed to confer with the
company to ask for needed reforms.
After the meeting the committee of
three, composed of L. Rockwell. E. P.
E. Troy and Felix McHugh, met and
decided to request the following
chang-es:
Firetâ 'That the company restrict the speed
of its cars throughout the district.
Second â That no more passengers be allowed
on cars In Â«-xcÂ«-ss of one -half the nurcber added
to the seating rapacity.
Third â That more cars be run at shorter In
tervale In the dlFtrlrt.

A reception has been arranged to
take place next Monday afternoon in
the California State building at the St.
Louis Exposition. The California Com
missioners to the exposition will re
ceive the guests from California. The
affair will" be informal.
This forenoon at 11 o'clock -a special
train, of Pullman cars will leave the
Oakland mole to take the California
State Board of Trade excursion to the
St. Louis Exposition. Earlier in the
season the State Board of Trade sent
out an excursion, which was suffi
ciently successful to make it seem to
be advisable to give another.
The party to leave this forenoon will
be larger than the first. It will em
brace business and professional men
trom all parts of California. Secretary
L. M. Fletcher of the State Board of*
Trade, who has brought the excur
sionists together, visiting many towns
and cities for that purpose, will have
charge of the train. Included in the
excursion outfit will be an observation
car, dining car, composite library car
and a sufficient number of sleepers
to accommodate the excursionists.

ftiATE SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
In answer to a description wired by
the Los Angeles police Franklin C-
Holmes of that city was arrested last
night by Detective O'Dea on Market
street Holmes was taken to the city
prison and locked up for the night, his
name being placed on the "night lodg
ers' " book instead of the regular de
tinue book. So much mystery, how
ever, ; was maintained by the police
that a rumor was soon in circulation
that the well-dressed stranger was an
important criminal.
This suspicion was dispelled later by
a dispatch from Los Angeles, an
nouncing that Holmes was wanted by
hir wife and not by the police on any
criminal charge. The lady had in
formed the police that her husband
had been missing from home for more
than. a week and she had learned he
was In San Francisco. She told the
Los Angeles police he had been on a
drunken spree for several weeks and
she wanted him arrested for his own
protection. Mrs. Holmes will arrive in
this city to-day to take charge of the
wandering one.

John Black, the footpad who terror
ized the .Mission district about eight
months ago, was sentenced by Judge
Dunne yesterday to serve twenty-five
years In Folsom penitentiary on a
charge of assault to rob. Three other
charges were placed on the reserve
calendar. Black's face showed vary
ing signs of surprise and rage while
the Judge was pronouncing sentence.
He was tried and convicted by a
Jury for holding up Elhannan J.
Treese on the night of March 26 on
Twenty-second street, near Dolores.
Treese was accompanied by Mrs. Al
berta Butler of 100 Chattanooga street,
and they were on their way to a the
ater. Black had a revolver in his
hand and when he ordered Treese to
throw up his hands Treese struck at
him with an umbrella. Black fired at
Treese and the bullet shattered one of
his- fingers.
There was also a charge of assault
to murder against Black for shooting
Treese, and charges of burglary and
assault to murder for entering the
grocery of Robinson & Knox, 878 Va
lencia street, and firing a shot at A. B.
Knox on the night of March 12. Black
is an ex-convict.
Judge Dunne Orders John Black Con
fined in Folsom Penitentiary

last evening at St. Rose's Hall in aid
of St. Rose's bazaar. Members of St,

vided a programme which contained
vocal and instrumental solos, recita

A dance followed the entertainment.
On Friday evening:, October 14. a. leap
year party is to be given in St. Rose's
Hall for the benefit of St Rose's com

appear on the occasion and a very
large attendance is assured.
Benefit for St. Rose's Bazaar.
Collector of Port Stratton and the
wlfÂ« of District Customs Inspector
James Campbell arÂ« exerting: them
selves to penetrata the mystery sur
rounding the sudden disappearance of
Campbell, who has been in charge of
the customs affairs at the Mail Dock.
Ho disappeared last Friday without
Sivinar his wife or his associates in the
customs service the slightest Intima
tion as to where he was going. Early
on that day he telephoned a request to
the Custom-house that he be furnished
an assistant, and one was promptly
sent to him. Later he left the dock
and has not been heard of since. Ac
cording to reports received at the Cus
tom-house from officers at the Mall
Dock, Campbell had apparently been
brooding over something for quite a
while and his fellow officers have rea
son to believe that it was family
troubles. /
Before leaving tha dock Campbell
placed his badge and official seal upon
his desk. This has suggested to his
superiors that he had carefully
planned his sudden leave taking.' He
has been in the service for a number
of years and is referred to by the
higher officials. of the department as
one of the most conscientious men In
the employ of the Government It is
believed by his associates that he has
left town to rid his mind of worry
and will be heard of later.

Kven If It were lawful to submit these propo
sitions at the ensuing election It would seem
to me hardly expedient to do so, as it would
be practically Impossible for a voter compre
hendlngly to consider them all at one time
and at such an election. .
In the face both of the illegality of such sub
mission and of its perplexity, it la quite diffi
cult to understand why the Board of Super
visors should have needlessly expended large
sums of the people's money in uselessly adver
tising at full length for a long period In the
official newspaper these many proposed changes
In the city's organic law.
In my message to the Beard of Supervisors
vetoing certain of these propositions I observed
in effect that we were apparently about to
face a charter amending epidemic. This state
ment Is quite well confirmed by the fact that
twenty-two propositions are submitted at one
election and that. too. one at which Presiden
tial electors and other candidates are to ba
voted for.
I conclude, therefore, that It would be an Il
legal and a void act en your part to have these
propositions placed upon the ballot, and I rec
ommend that they be omitted therefrom.
AMENDING EPIDEMIC IS OX.
Under section 8 of article 11 of the consti
tution of California (above referred to) the
charter may be amended at Intervals of not
less than two years. The charter was last
amended by amendments submitted to the vot
ers of San Franclsc at an election held De
cember 4, 1002. less than two years prior to
Novmber 4. 1904. The proposed twenty-two
amendments, therefore. It would seem, would,
if submitted at the next election, be within
the time limitation of the constitution and
would, therefore. If ratified, be void.
The evident Intent of the constitution in
thus limiting the amending of the charter to
two year Intervals was undoubtedly to pre
serve Its integrity and to prevent elections at
every moment and on every conceivable pre
text. But for thts provision twenty-two sepa
rate elections in twenty-two different weeks
might be called to pass upon the twenty-two
propositions now attempted to be submitted.
I think It clear that before December 4, 1904.
no charter amendments can properly bÂ» sub
mitted.
It Is further my opinion that no amendments
to the charter can properly be submitted at
the election to be held on November 8. 1904,
and that any action submitting such amend
ments at this election would be unconstitution
al and void.
I therefore submit to you that on the- fore
going grounds the so-called charter amend
ments Nos. 2 to 12. inclusive, originating with
the Board of Supervisors, not having received
my approval aod not having been presented to
me. cannot lawfully be submitted to the peo
ple, and If so submitted to the people and by
them ratified they would be absolutely void.
Proposed amendment No. 1, relating to re
duction of the tax limit from |1 to 85 cents
per $100 of assessed valuation, was approved
by me and Is not open to the objection above
specified.
There can be. in my opinion, no escape from
the proposition that no valid submission of a
proposed amendment of the charter of San
Francisco originating from the Board of Su
pervisors can be made without presentation to
and action by the Mayor, as. In said section 18
set forth.
The proposed amendments numbered 7 to 12
have never been submitted to me. have never
received my signature and cannot legally be
submitted at the coming election.
The charter of the city and county of San
Francisco may ba amended under the pro
visions of section 8. article XI of the consti
tution of the State of California "at Intervals
of not less than two years by proposals there
for submitted by the legislative authority of
the city to the qualified electors thereof at a
general or special election." etc.
The legislative authority oÂ£ the city and
county of San Francisco under the charter Is
the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor.
Neither the Board of Supervisors nor the May
or alone has any legislative authority.
Legislative power Is vested In the Board of
Supervisors, but the exercise of such power
is ineffective unless confirmed by the approval
of the Mayor, or after his disapproval by the
vote of fourteen members of the Board of
Supervisors orerrullns hiÂ» veto; and no leg
islation is authorized nor does legislative au
thority exist except in the concurrent action
of the Board of Supervisors and of the Mayor
(subject, however, to the charter provisions
relative to his veto power).
3HJST HAVE MAYOR'S APPROVAIa.
The legislative authority and legislative
power can be exercised only by legislative act.
Under section 8 of chapter 1 article II. of the
charter, every legislative act of the city shall
be by ordinance. Under sections Â© and 16
of the same article every bill and every reso
lution which shall have passed the board shall
be presented to the Mayor for hla approval,
and must ba acted upon by him aa In said
section 16 provided.
So-called proposed amendments Kos. 2 to 6
Inclusive were submitted to me by the Board
of Supervisors for my signature and were by
me vetoed for reasons given at length' in my
veto message to the Supervisors, which vetoes
have never been overruled and have therefore
become final under the provisions of section
16. chapter 1 of article II of the charter.
The Election Commission last even-
Ing received a communication from
Mayor Schmitz advising it not to give
place on the official ballot to the pro
posed twenty-two charter amendments
the Supervisors ordered submitted to
tha voters at the election next month.
The Mayor gives it as his opinion that
the voting on the amendments would
be illegal as well as inexpedient and
informs the Commissioners that pro
posed amendments 2 to 12. inclusive,
have never received his approval.
The board deferred action one week.
The following* was the statement from
the Mayor:
Gentlemen: I ara Informed that thÂ» elerk
of the Board of Supervisor* has transmitted
to you for submission to th* voters of San
Francisco at the ensuing election twenty-two
so-called 'proposed charter amendments, num
bered respectively from 1 to 22.
Your attention Is hereby called to thÂ» fact
that tha so-called proposed amendments num
bered 2 to 12 Inclusive, being; those origin
ating from the Board of Supervisors (with
the exception of proposed amendment No. 1)
have never been approved by me as required
by law, and can therefore have no place upon
thÂ« ballot.
Manager Arthur R. Briggs of the
California State Board of Trade was
somewhat surprised Tuesday when a
Russian gentleman connected with
horticulture and agriculture In the
land of the Czar made the announce
ment that he had* come to California
to find out the best way to raise figs
and raisins in Russia.
The inquirer Is W. Teubatchsw, who
was introduced. In accordance with
the wishes of the Russian Govern
ment, by the Russian Consul in this
city. "With Ru33ia involved in a great
war. In which the principal Russian
aim would seem to be to secure out
lets at points where the winter will
not shut in its fleets,' ordinary sup
position would be that Russia Is not
much of a land in which to produca
fruits which, until California, took up
their culture, have been grown prin
cipally in the Mediterranean lands-
Mr. Teubatchew asserted, however,
that raisins and figs will certainly
grow In Russia as well as in California-
According to his statements there ara
areas in which the climatic conditions
much resemble those of California,
and where the nature of the soil Is also
similar. Mr. Teubatchew has visited
Fresno, but is still seeking for more
information and so visited the Cali
fornia State Board of Trade, where a
vast amount of data. Is always avail
ble. referring to tha State's Industries
and the manner in which they ara
cenducted.

Hay and Feedstufis.
I Bran is very firm and the millers are con
i slderlng an advance.
1 Hay remains exactly a? before. The circular
f of Â£<5nÂ«?rÂ» & Co. saysv
!Â¦ Â¦ ''Total arrival* H H*y for the week show ,
i but 3100 tons, a decrease of 7<Xt tons from
I the weeU yT<cÂ«Â«l;ng. The railroad Â¦ company '
has been bc1:yi:ij? cars to most â¢ intending ship- .
pers in order that they "mffcht market the large ",
-cvmber of- cars ihlch have been Sidetracked
throughout the conqtry for several weeks past.
This has now practically been accomplished
â¢ and it !Â» expected from this time on shipments
I may be resumed in the regular manner. There
Â¦ are still a number of old cars out. but track
1 room will be given these very shortly.
. "In spite of the fact that a large amount
! of Hay was daihaged by the recent rains, yet
Â¦ quite a portion of this will find Its way
i to market; for the succeeding pleasant weather
i has enabled the- farmers to sort over their
: stacks, both baled and unbaled. and by dls
1 posing of the worst of it at home they will
- not suffer so great a loss as waa originally ex-
J pectrd.- Considerable spotted Hay is now be
i ing shipped and more will follow later. This
I will result in off grade goods going at low
I prices, with an advance on sound lots which
1 were housed before the rain."

Poultry and Game.,
Receipts of domestic Poultry were liberal,
but trade was more active than â¢ previously
and the market cleaned up well. A better
demand was noted for small chickens, such as
Fryer, and Broilers, but prices showed no imÂ«
provement. No Western stock came in, but
a car was hourly expected. -Sound Game met
with -prompt sale at good prices.

NETV TOSK. Oct. 8.â TherÂ» wej an excited
and feverish market for securities ail day to
day and the volume of busiceea somewhat ex
ceeded yesterday's large total, in spite of tn
twals of decided Â£u!!nees in the trading.
The movement of prices was so wide and the
Cuctuatiocs so constant and conflicting as to
keep speculative sentiment unsettled and to
puirle the traders wto sought to follow the
market. The so-called roora tradicg. howerer,
was on an enormous scale, and operations of
this charsxrer fharged cftea ficris*- the day
ban the long to the short side. Such news
as â -r .^ to explain the movement cf prices
f^nied Quite inadequate to acoouct for the
vioience- cf ductuatiotus. The widest movements
Â»'tre without any news to account for them.
St. Paul opened cue point higher, relapsed to a
fraction unJer last night, shot up. to 1Â«S>Â»Â» and
Suctuated constantly between ttie extremes,
with tr.ore cr lesÂ« e>iapÂ«.thetJc effect on the
whole list. Tfce stock was affected solely by ru
mors with no decaile cannrmaUons. or, more
troperiy, the eaormous and mysterious volume
cf the dealings- and the erratic fluctuations
kept up the Sow of runora, which rejires*nted
; --; Â¦ : conjectures as much as acy Informed
reports. United Stalt* Steel waa aubjected to
further heavy eellicg. but showed evidence of
support *nd recovered visorousdy In. the late
market, bat net before a number of Independ
ent steel stocks had weakened In fyiapathy.
Trade cens to account far the movement was
ts much lacking aa on the advance In the
prcup. Tile trunk lines were heavy at first,
but moved briskly upward later under the lead
ership of PensÂ«ylvÂ«r;a. Its subsidiary slocks.
including ifce flifferentlal Ucea, lagged in the
tr.ovener.t, ; aithough a rumor was circulated of
a corcicg increase ta. the B&ltimore and Ohio
tftvMaad rate. This was the only apparent
ground fcr tie movement In this group. 7Tje
a.-aerted abandecment cf the lead merger plan
helped to deprere the lead and Â«metter stocks.

CHICAGO, Oct. 5. â Continuance of a liberal
movement in the Northwest and lower prices
in foreign grain markets gave wheat an easier
tone at the start. December was unchanged
to He lower at |1 12^61 I2>4. while May was
unchanged to U'i' t c lower at 91 12?Â»@1 12%.
A prominent commission house was a heavy
seller of the December option and started act
ive selling by the pit crowd. A lot of Decem
ber and alay wheat was offered for sale by
small holders. The demand not being sufficient
to absorb offerings, prices declined uninter
ruptedly. Numerous etop-loss orders came out,
adding to the weakness. Announcement of a
big increase In primary receipts was an Influ
ential bear factor late in the day. The low
point on December for the session was reached
at $1 10%. May in the meantime sold off to
fl 1OT*. Duringr the last ffw.minutM of trad-
Ing some recovery was made on buying by
shorts, but the market closed weak, with De
cember lHc decline at ?l 11%. May closed at
|111%9111H.
Small receipts at? i an official forecast of a
cold wave to-night held corn prices firm early
In the day. Later in the session sentiment
became* somewhat easier. December closed a
shade lower at r.iQ-51 iÂ«,c.
Oats were steady, but trading was extremely
light. December closed a shade under yester
day at M\iC.
Provisions were weak as a result of the sell-
Ing out of a large lot of January lard by a lo
cal trader. At the close January pork was
down 12Vs@15c. lard waa off 2V4c and ribs
were 7 l jc lower. s ,

constitutions. As to the Federal constitution,
it is well settled that the right, of suffrage and
conduct of elections are under the exclusive
control - of each State,*,' except so: far as I such
control is limited by the fourteenth and fifteenth
amendments, neither, of which, in my view,
has any application to the case at bar. ' ,
t Tho argument * that the Â¦ provision in ques
tion violates the State. constitution, in that it
deprives the act.of Â» uniform operation, has
greater force. tp But since .the Â¦ decisions over
throwing former primary election > laws Â¦ there
has been adopted an amendment to the State
constitution (article 2, section 2%) the purpose
of which,undoubtedly : was to obviate*the ob
jections which had been urged against the acts
heretofore passed. .-That â¢ amendment:, author
izes the Legislature to'determine the "tests and
conditions upon which 'electors,' political < parties
or organizations -of. voters may participate in
any â¢ â¢ primary election." .
I am not prepared to say that this does not
authorize the Legislature to provide that one
condition â¢ upon â¢ which; a: political party â¢ may
participate in such election is that r iU shall
have demonstrated a'certatn numerical strength
by.polling 3 per cent.of the votes cast at;the
next preceding election. Furthermore,-. It may
be remarked that, - even before the' constitu
tional amendment, 'the- Judicial declaration
against,the similar-3 per, cent;provision in; the
primary law of 1809 'was not concurred Â¦ In ' by
a. [ majority 'of the court In Brittan vs. Election
Commissioners. 129 Cal.S37.. â¢ - .Â¦Â¦Â¦
;On the whole case, the argument against the
constitutionality, of' the * law â¢ of : 1901. and sec
tlon 164 \t, ~ of i. the Penal,, Code la > not Â¦ so. clear
that this court*.would Â¦ be justified' in declaring

At that time the witness did not
know who Wyman was, but he imme
diately made inquiry among bystanders
to ascertain his identity. Later he
made it a point to have a look at the
! defendant, and identified him positively
as the man who stuffed a vote into the
ballot-box.
WHEELAX'S MOTIVE QUESTIOXED
The broadness of the cross-examina
tion. Countryman explained, was for
the purpose of showing an unworthy
â¢ motive on the part of Wheelan for
i prosecution of Wyman. Insinuating
j questions. were asked as to his "politi
j cal ambitions," but he denied having
I any.
â¢ "My purpose In politics," he ex
j plained with warmth, "is to have the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District repre
sented by men who wear no livery nor
the collar of any boss. Three times now
| I have worked actively in the district
j against the Maestretti ticket, which
i was always headed by the name of R.
H. Countryman."
Asked whom he associated with In
the political affairs of the district, the
witness named Judge J. R. Aitken,
i Warren Gregory, Wallace Bradford,
Charles Sheffield, Edwin McMurray,
Messrs. Hampton and Cassidy and oth
' ers.
Judge Cabaniss fussed a great deal
Wheelan reiterated his testimony
given on direct examination as to how !
he stood at the door of the voting place
and saw. Wyman copying Mann's name ;
on the roster from the register he had
under his arm. This was shortly after 4 â¢
o'clock. The defendant was given a Â¦
ballot, proceeded to the booth and on ;
emerging announced to the inspector
that his name was' Mann. The com- .
plainant made note in his memorandum I
book at the time of every move of '
Wyman while voting fraudulently, jot- !
ting down the words he heard spoken
and the exact time of the casting of the :
ballot. Wheelan's testimony coincides
In every particular with that of his son,
who stood beside him at the entrance
to the voting place. j
In the cross-examination, that bore
directly on the charge against Wyman.
Wheelan was positive In the assertion
that he saw the defendant commit the
forgery on the roster, and the effort^ of
Countryman to shake his testimony
were not successful, for the witness at
every turn seemed to clinch matters
the stronger. When he had identified
the forged name on the roster he was
examined searchingly as to his memory
of the writing of it by the defendant.
He said:
Tou will notice that In the formation of the
letter P. the first initial. It might be mistaken
for an L- I recall distinctly his penning of
that, for I was in doubt which letter he in
tended. Then I have a- distinct recollection
of the unusual formation of the H of the
second initial that impressed itself on my mind
forcibly at the time. Tou will also notice the
peculiar turn at the base of the figure 2 in
the street number. ThiÂ« also attracted my
attention particularly at the time.
In answer to a question of Country
man as to his reason for not calling the
attention of the election officers to the
crime that Wyman was committing the
witness said:
I was satisfied that it was hopeless to ap
peal to an election bo^ird that was not put
there to obey the law. If a man had come
into that booth and written on the roster that
he was Julius Caesar of Catacombs. Rome, he
would have been allowed to vote.
I made no protect because 1 knew that I
Â¦would be lied down by that board of officers.
Another reason why I remained 6ilent while
Wyman was voting illegally was the fear that
a criminal miRbt escape after learning that
he bad been detected.
While Wheelan's testimony reflected
severely on the election board In the
Almshous* precinct, he was much more
forceful in his statements against the
board in the Seventy-third Precinct,
where he says he saw Wyman pen the
forgery of S. H. Mann's name and cast
the fraudulent ballot.
ELECTION BOARD STOOD IX.
bulldozed around here." Then he asked if I
thought a pauper was a criminal and I an
twered that I did .not. He declared that there
were better men inside the Alrr-fhous* than
many cutside, and I remarked that I had no
doubt of It. He wanted to know who said
that a pauper had no right to vote. ( but I
could givÂ« him no information.
At this juncture Maestrrttl came rushing
into the booth with fire- in hi* rye. "What
the h*ll arc you doing here?" he called, out
to me. I tacwercd that I was pimply taking
advantage of the right of an Amrriran citizen.
"I ordf-r you out. I order the f lrction officers
to put you out.'" Mae^trftti cried. I demand
ed to know bis authority and hU reason and
he rerponded that I was intimidating voters.
After that Ma^Ftretti went up to his coyotes
up Â»t -the Almshouse. Tt was not long until
Frank Schmitz appeared on the scene. H*
came over to me and, putting his face down
close to mine, said, "I won't. have any men
Continuing, "VYheelan testified that he
saw the defendant, Wyman, sitting in
the rear of the ccurtroom at the time,
with his hand partially covering his
face. The witness suspected that some
deception was being attempted and was
watching every move of those interest
ed in the defense. His recollection wa3
pesitive as to the part he believed
Countryman was playing.
The wide range of the cross.-examina
tion of the complainant brought to
light some exciting experiences that
Wheelan had on the day of the pri
mary election. According to his testi
mony Public Works Commissioner
Maestretti and Frank Schmitz, brother
of the Mayor and superintendent of the
Almshouse, acted toward the witness
like ruffians.
READY TO GO TO SAN* QUENTIN*.
Wheelan then testified largely as fol
lows:
I had heard that every inmate of the Alms
houc was to \f compelled to vote as a Rf-
FUbliran and I went over to that precinct to
see what was going on. I saw an inspector
named P-pbstock refuse to administer the oath
to a man whose vote was challenged. The in
spector eaid he was ready to go to San Quen
tin if necessary- I entered a protest and
finally Bebstock telrphonÂ«Â»d to the ReglEtrar's
ofSc*. He then said he would put the voter
under oath, but not In the form I said the
law directed.
Later a man from the Almfhouse named
Dwjf-r arrived. He asked for a Republican
bÂ«l!ot and I challencl hi* vote on the ground
that he had no intention of voting tho Repub
lican tirict at the general election. "I will
vote the Republican ticket now. but I am
going to vote as a Democrat at the election."
was Dwyer's answer whÂ»n the question was
put to him.
I at once declared that he bad no rlrht.
ur.dc r his own ftatpmÂ»nt. to vote at the pri
mary at a RppuMican.
The attorney asked several more
questions of the same character in the
effort to shake Wheelan's confidence in
his statement, but the witness only be
came the more emphatic in the serious
aspersion on Countryman.
After adjournment of court Country
man said that Wheelan must have mis
taken a wave of the hand as pointing
fco the â¢'ringer.'*
â¢â¢Are you as fure that you saw me point to
tfce r:ry:"cr a* the defendant as you are about

ttr question hotly from Countryman.

Thirdâ The main . attack of i petitioner is on
the act of 1901, pursuant to which the primary
election in question, was held. .The feature -of
the law. principally I assailed . Is L the one i which
glve3 certain privileges : to -. political ; parties
which .polled Â¦ Scperjcenfsof Uhe< total -vote, at
the ' next ; preceding * election. .. It i is > urged that
this violates j both , the F.deral . and - the State
; Second â It is nrged that as section &iy. was
adopted In 1899 It had reference to the primary
law of that year, which was thereafter ><ie
clared unconstitutional, and that with the fall
of the law providing for the only condition upon
which (J4% could operate this section itself
fell, and was not revived by the passage of a
later primary, election law. The point has
apparently considerable force but in the ab
eence of the citation of ; any, authority -in its
support can hardly be regarded Vas* affordine
sufficient warrant, for. this court- to i declare
section C4% inoperative. ' * ,-.
I think there can be no question that the
title* "An act to amend the Penal Code of
the State of California, by adding a new sec
tion Â¦ thereto, to be numbered &i%, relating to
elections, by providing for the punishments of
offenses at primary elections," definitely 'ex
presses the subject of the act within the mean
ing of the constitutional' provision- invoked "
Nor Is the act adopting section diV. 'of the
Fenal Code open to the objection that It
amends sections 40 to 64, referred to In section
64%. without re-enacting such sections ThÂ«i
provision requiring law* i amended . to bÂ« ro
enacted c has no reference to statutes which
merely amend others by implication. Section
04% does not purport to amend any other
section. :. It is supplementary legislation, which
leaves entirely unimpaired the force of the
sections to which it refers.
Firstâ It is urced that section 64% of the
Penal Code Is invalid in that the act of 1899
adoptimr it failed in its title to declare the
subject of the act. and that the section amends
other sections, without re-enacting- such sec
tions at lensth. ,
To succeed In this, proceeding the' petitioner
must show that the acts in question arc
clearly and unquestionably In conflict with the
organic law. It is thoroughly well settled that
no court will declare a legislative act uncon
stitutional where there Is a reasonable doubt
as to the validity of the act. And this rule
applies with greater force to Inferior courts.
Three principal points are made by . peti
tioner - â¢Â»-Â¦
The decision of Judge Sloss yesterday
does not greatly strengthen the status
of the primary law. He refused to un
dertake passing upon it upon its con
stitutionality and passes the question
to the Supreme Court. To him the con
tention of petitioner that failure to re
enact a statute providing for penalties
for violation of the primary law de
prived the law of punitive value Â¦ has
considerable force. Counsel failed,
however, to support his argument with
any citation.
When the primary law of 1899 was
passed section 64*4 w&s enacted, provid
ing that violations of it were to be pun
ished In the same manner as for viola
tions of the general election law. The
Supreme Court declared the primary
law of 1899 to be unconstitutional, and
Attorney Countryman contends that
section 64% fell with it . The Legisla
ture did not re-enact section 64% when
it passed the primary law of 1901.
The following is Judge Sloss' opin
ion:
John A- Hosmer, special prosecutor
employed by. the Merchants' Associa
tion, said yesterday that several more
arrests for fraudulent voting at the
primaries will in all probability â¢ soon
be made.
FAILED TO EXPLOIT GOOD POINT.
Countryman had him write his sig
nature and afterward declared that he
would prove that the name on the ros
ter was in the same handwriting.
Judge Cabaniss continued the exam
ination to Monday at 11 o'clock.
The> police have obtained no clew to
the whereabouts of Adolph Steffens,'
who was indicted by the Grand Jury
for fraudulently voting the name of C.
C. Crew in the Seventy-third Precinct.
Some of Steffens' friends give the as
surance that he will be on hand when
the prosecution is ready to go ahead
with the case. The Indicted fireman
figured in yesterday's proceedings,
Wheelan describing him as one of three
men who were locked inside the booth
at 5 o'clock and allowed to vote after
the polls were closed.
The last witness was S. H. Mann,
whose name Wyman is accused of hav
ing voted. He testified that he was
not near the polls on primary day and
declared the signature of his name on
the roster to be a forgery. He ' is a
special policeman and on the day of
the election was not living at the place
designated In' the register from which
the defendant copied.
MANX NOT NEAR POLLS.
over extraneous testimony because of
the time it unnecessarily consumed,
but counsel for the prosecution were
willing to let the examination go to
any length and Wheelan was eager to
engage in the frequent passages be
tween himself and Countryman. The
exchanges were good-humored in tone,
but there was often a shaft that was
Intended to sting, for the factional feel
ins in the Thirty-ninth is oftentimes
bitter.
Much speculation has been aroused
over the real purposes of the Oakland
and Marysville Company and particu
larly as to whether it is the preliminary
move in some new transcontinental pro
ject. F. W. Zeile is president of the
Mercantile Trust Company and John
D. McKee is cashier of the same cor
poration, a fact which leads many to
suppose that the Mercantile Trust Com
pany is acting in the Interest of some
outside combination of capital. If an
Eastern road is contemplating reaching
Oakland it is generally conceded that
the route chosen by the Oakland and
Marysville Company is about the most
available. Whether the new company
has obtained terminal rights in Oak
land is a matter which the incorpora
tors of the road will not admit. In fact
they have declined to give out any. in
formation further than is to be found
in the articles of incorporation. In
discussing the matter Attorney Cope,
who filed the articles and who is named
as one of the incorporators, said the
company was organized for legitimate
purposes, but refused to intimate
who was behind the project or just
what property rights the company held
on the ether side of the bay.
â¢j* : Â¦!Â¦
The Oakland and Marysville Railway
Company yesterday filed articles of in
corporation in which it is announced as
the intention of the new concern to
build a road between the points named,
a distance of 115 miles: The company
gives its route as commencing at tide

IXCOKPOBATOES SILENT
Harry Jones, printer, denied Mrs. Ju
lia Wittman's charge that he knocked
her down when she accused him of
maliciously ringing her doorbell and
otherwise annoying her. Miss C.'Neal
corroborated Mr. Jones' statement, and
added that the Wittman doorbell was
rung by naughty little boys. Judge
Cabaniss dismissed the case.
Mrs. Wittman and Mr. Jones are next
door neighbors on Mary place, extend
ing from Fifth street to Sixth between
Mission and Howard. The lady In
formed the court that Mr. Jones has
employed his spare hours in the inven
tion and execution of plans- to make
her life unpleasant. The bell-ringing
was not by any means the least harass
ing, of his devices. He also broke win
dows In her house, she alleged, and
threatened to kill her husband, Emile.
"I vants mine pore leedle hosband
prodecded, Shoodge," said Mrs. Witt
man. "Dese beoplesâ dese Shonesesâ
vas hooderlums. Dis; Harry Shones
says dot- he knocks mine leedle hos
band's brains oud, .und he ring mine
bell, und he smash me more den nine
vlndows, und he took me by mine two
hands und he trow me down' righd here
In der city. I vas a citizen, Shoodge,
und bay mine taxes."
Mr. Jones and Miss* Neal united in
the statement that Mrs. Wittmah's
Virginia Grey, was entertaining a
large : and appreciative audience on
K*-arny street by singing "Fishing,"
when Patrolman Kavanaugh ran her
In as a vagrant. Her defense will be
heard next Saturday.
Patrolman J. Barrett testified that
Susie Wagner was reclining against
an Eddy street lamppost when he over
hauled her at 1:30 o'clock ysterday
morning and he might have believed
her tale of heart failure if her utter
ance had been more distinct and her
breath less redolent of liquor. Case
continued till October 8.
"La Madrilina" was the name called
by the bailiff, and a buxom woman of
pronounced Spanish complexion re
sponded to it. Patrolman McMurray
said she was intoxicated when he ar
rested her on Kearny street late Tues
day night, and she asked for and was
granted time to prepare a defense. Her
next appearance in court will be on
October 8.
The most serious charge was that
against May Parker. She stabbed Ed
mund. Parker, her consort, the night
of October 1 at their residence on Clem
entina street and the man's condition
has become so serious as to impel the
police to formally accuse her of as
sault with intent to commit murder.
She said she was Parker's wife, but
the detectives say her spouse is
a convict named Johnson, who is
now "doing" eight years in San Quen
tin for counterfeiting. When arraigned
yesterday she said she had no counsel
and was penniless, so the court ap
pointed Attorney Joseph Taafe to de
fend her and set the hearing for next
Wednesday. She is tall and thin and
attired in black. Parker is a waiter.
May McNamee was chasing passing
pedestrians off the sidewalk at Fifth
ana Folsom streets when Patrolman J.
Ryan arrested her and she blushingly
confessed to the Judge that she had
imbibed more ardent spirits than was
good for her mentality. She will be
sentenced to-day.
Minnie Aguirre, a semi-centenarian,
ran away from the Almshouse and was
asieep on a doorstep on Fourth street
when Patrolman Avery found her. Sen
tence deferred.
Rose Lewis, a comely young bru
nette, averred it was police persecution
that placed her where she was. Pa
trolman Heinrichs arrested her as she
was "rushing the growler" on Howard
street, near Fourth, at an early hour
yesterday morning and so fiercely did
she resist him that he welcomed the ar
rival of another policeman to assist in
her subjugation. Sentence to-day.
Mabel Dodge, youthful and good
locking, "threw a fit" in court when
she was pronounced guilty of vagrancy
and remanded for sentence. She was
arrested at Mission and Sixth streets
by Patrolman P. Sullivan, who gave
her a very bad character.
"I don't have to work for a living,"
said May McDonough, "because my
folks are well-to-do and send me^all
the money I want." Despite her declar
ation erf dependence Miss McDon
ough was convicted of vagrancy by the
testimony of Patrolman G. E. Brown,
who arrested her at 921 Howard street
Tuesday night. She will be sentenced
to-day.
Femininity had unusual representa
tion on Police Judge Mogan's calendar
yesterday morning. No less than nine
women defendants confronted his Hon
or when he ascended the bench and,
with accustomed gallantry, he gave
their cases 'precedence.
H. J. Woods, accused of vagrancy,
said he was a student, but Patrolman
Orr described him a "cigar store statue
at O'Farrell street and Grant avenue,"
and Judge Mogan took the officer's
word for it. Sentence to-day.
Bryan Collins, who robbed' two work
men of their temporarily discarded
coats in Golden Gate Park, will be
sentenced to-day by Judge Mogan.
George Addison pleaded inability to
understand how he could reasonably
be accused of vagrancy as he was the
husband of an actress in a North End
music hall, who was perfectly willing
to support him. Indeed, he hinted, she
preferred to have him . abstain from
toil, as she earned enough money to
keep both of them in comfort. If the
court, which was Judge Mogan, enter
tained any doubt as to the truth of
Mr. Addison's statement there was his
marriage certificate to prove that his
provider was really his wife. The court
did not question the defendant's claim
of being a benedict, but considered him
a" vagrant just the same, and will sen
tence him to-day.
When asked by Judge Mogan why
he so obstinately offended Mr. Vers said
that the hod carriers had instructed
him to unload the bricks in a certain
way, and he considered obedience to
their instructions more important than
any inconvenience to which he might
put the traveling public.
Sentence deferred until to-day.
"*â¢ â¢ â¢
Six carloads of delayed passengers im
plored and threatened John Vers, team
ster, but he calmly ignored their protests
and deliberately removed bricks from
his -wagon one" by one 'until the ve
hicle was emptied. Then he started
to drive away, when Patrolman P. J.
McKenna placed him . under arrest for
obstructing the highway.
It was on Post street, near Leaven
worth, that Vers blocked the street
railway until half a dozen cars were
congregated. He was unloading bricks
at a building in course of construction,,
and for twenty-seven minutes his team
occupied the c^r track while he picked
up the cubes one at a time and care
fully set them down alongside the
curb.
T. J. Nolan, electrician, residing at
465A Capp street, was chasing his
wife, Anita, at Sixth and Howard
streets last Tuesday night when he
tripped and fell over a foot thrust out
by Special Policeman Castro. As soon
as he regained his feet Mr. Nolan
grabbed the officer and threw him
down, and after a brief scrimmage the
arrest ,was accomplished.
When accused of battery on the po
liceman Mr. Nolan told Judge Mogan
that the pursuit of Anita was not in
anger, but simply to give her physical
exercise, of which she stood greatly in
need, despite the fact that she was af
flicted with heart trouble. The officer,
however, informed the court that while
the hunt was in progress A,nita was ap
parently terrified and her husband en
raged. So the court pronounced Mr.
Nolan guilty as charged and promised
to prescribe h!s punishment to-day.
grievances were largely imaginary, and
hinted that her hallucinations were 01
alcoholic origin.

JUPGE SLOSS decided yes

Charles Wyman did not
warrant him in holding un
constitutional the primary law
